The '''Emperor Penguin''' (''Aptenodytes forsteri'') is the tallest and heaviest of all living [[penguin]] species and [[Endemism in birds|endemic]] to [[Antarctica]]. The male and female are similar in plumage and size, reaching {{convert|122|cm|in|0|abbr=on}} in height and weighing anywhere from 22&nbsp;to&nbsp;37&nbsp;kg (48.5-82&nbsp;lb). The upperparts are black and cleanly defined from the white belly, pale yellowish breast and bright yellow ear patches.

[[Fish]] form the bulk of the diet but [[crustacean]]s, such as [[krill]] and [[squid]], are also hunted. The Emperor Penguin is the only penguin species that breeds during the Antarctic winter, trekking 50-120 km over the ice to breeding colonies in the autumn as the sea ice advances. The female lays a single egg, which is incubated by the male alone over the following two months, in colonies of sometimes thousands of individuals. The life span is typically 20&nbsp;years in the wild, although some observations suggest a feasible lifespan of up to 50&nbsp;years.

== Taxonomy ==

The Emperor Penguin was described in 1844 by English zoologist [[George Robert Gray]], its generic name being derived from the [[Ancient Greek]] ''a''/<U+03B1> 'without' ''pteno-''/<U+03C0><U+03C4><U+03B7><U+03BD><U+03BF>- 'feather' or 'wing' and ''dytes''/<U+03B4><U+03C5><U+03C4><U+03B7><U+03C2> 'diver'.<ref name="Liddell 1980">{{cite book | author = [[Henry George Liddell|Liddell, Henry George]] and [[Robert Scott (philologist)|Robert Scott]] | year = 1980 | title = [[A Greek-English Lexicon]] (Abridged Edition) | publisher = [[Oxford University Press]] | location = United Kingdom | isbn = 0-19-910207-4}}</ref> Its specific epithet is in honour of the German naturalist [[Johann Reinhold Forster]], who accompanied Captain James Cook on his second Pacific Voyage and officially named five other penguin species.

Together with the similarly coloured but smaller [[King Penguin]] (''A. patagonicus''), it is one of two extant species in the genus ''[[Aptenodytes]]''. [[Ridgen's Penguin]] (''A. ridgeni'') is an [[extinct]] species known from [[fossil]] bones of the Late [[Pliocene]], around 3 million years ago, in New Zealand.<ref name=Will13>Williams, p. 13</ref>

== Description ==

[[Image:Kaiserpinguine mit Jungen.jpg|thumb|Adults with chicks, showing relative sizes|left|250px]]
The adult Emperor Penguin stands up to {{convert|122|cm|in|0|abbr=on}} tall and can weigh anywhere from 22&nbsp;to&nbsp;37&nbsp;kg (48.5-82&nbsp;lb), depending on where it is in the reproductive cycle. Both male and female penguins lose substantial portions of their mass while raising hatchlings and [[avian incubation|incubating]] eggs.<ref name="ADW"/> The adult has deep black feathers dorsally, including the head, chin, throat, back, dorsal part of the flippers, and tail. The black plumage is sharply delineated from the light-coloured plumage elsewhere. The underparts of the wings and belly are white, becoming pale yellow in the upper breast, while the ear patches are bright yellow. The upper mandible of the {{convert|8|cm|in|1|abbr=on}} long bill is black, and the lower mandible can be pink, orange or lilac.<ref name=Will152>Williams (''The Penguins'') p. 152</ref> Males and females are similar in size and colouration.<ref name="ADW"/> A juvenile is slightly smaller in size and colouration to an adult; its auricular patches, chin and throat are white and its bill is black.<ref name=Will152/> The Emperor Penguin chick is covered with silver-grey [[down feather|down]] and has a black head and white mask.<ref name=Will152/> It weighs around {{convert|315|g|oz|0|abbr=on}} on hatching, and [[fledge]]s at around 50% of adult weight.<ref name=Will159/>

The Emperor Penguin's dark plumage fade to a brownish colour during November to February, before the yearly moult;<ref name=Will152/> this is a rapid process in penguins compared with other birds, taking around 34&nbsp;days in this species in January and February. Emperor Penguin feathers emerge from the skin after developing to one third total length, and before old feathers are lost, to reduce heat loss. New feathers then push old ones out, before finishing their growth.<ref name=Will45>Williams ''(The Penguins)'' p. 45</ref>

The average yearly survival rate of the Emperor Penguin has been measured at 95.1%, with an average life expectancy of 19.9&nbsp;years. The same researchers estimate 1% of Emperor Penguins born could feasibly reach an age of 50 years.<ref>{{fr icon}} {{cite journal |author=Mougin J-L, van Beveren M |year=1979|title=Structure et dynamique de la population de manchots empereur ''Aptenodytes forsteri'' de la colonie de l'archipel de Pointe G<U+00E9>ologie, Terre Ad<U+00E9>lie |journal=Compte Rendus Academie Science d<U+00E9> Paris |volume=289D |pages=157-60}}</ref>

=== Vocalization ===

As the species has no fixed nest sites, an individual Emperor Penguin is unable to use the location of nest-sites to find its partner or chick and hence relies on identifying them by call alone.<ref name=Will68>Williams ''(The Penguins)'' p. 68</ref> It utilizes a complex set of calls that are critical to individual recognition between parents, offspring, and mates,<ref name="ADW"/> displaying the widest variation in individual calls of all penguins.<ref name=Will68/> Vocalizing Emperor Penguins use two frequency bands simultaneously.<ref>Robisson P. (1992). "[http://elibrary.unm.edu/sora/Auk/v109n03/p0654-p0658.pdf Vocalizations in ''Aptenodytes'' Penguins: Application of the Two-voice Theory"] (PDF) ''[[The Auk|Auk]]'' '''109'''(3): 654-658 </ref> The chick uses a frequency-modulated whistle to beg for food and to contact parents.<ref name="ADW"/>

=== Adaptation to cold ===

The Emperor Penguin breeds in the coldest environment of any bird species; air temperatures may reach {{convert|-40|<U+00B0>C|<U+00B0>F|sigfig=2}}, and wind speeds may reach {{convert|144|km/h|mph|0|abbr=on}}. Water temperature is a frigid {{convert|-1.8|<U+00B0>C|<U+00B0>F|sigfig=2}}, thus much lower than the average body temperature of {{convert|39|<U+00B0>C|<U+00B0>F|sigfig=2}}. The species has adapted in several ways to counteract heat loss.<ref name=Will107>Williams ''(The Penguins)'' p. 107</ref> Emperor Penguins have a sub-dermal layer of fat which may be up to {{convert|3|cm|in|sigfig=2|abbr=on}} thick before breeding, but it is the feathers that are responsible for 80-90% of the insulation.<ref name=Will108>Williams ''(The Penguins)'' p. 108</ref> The stiff feathers are short and lanceolate (spear-shaped) and densely packed over the entire skin surface. An extra layer of insulation is formed of separate shafts of downy filaments between the feathers and skin. Muscles allow the feathers to be held erect on land, reducing heat loss by trapping a layer of air next to the skin. Conversely, the plumage is flattened in water, thus waterproofing the skin and downy underlayer.<ref name=Will10708>Williams ''(The Penguins)'' pp. 107-08</ref> Preening is also vital in keeping the plumage oily and water-repellent, and facilitating insulation.<ref name=Kooy90>{{cite journal |author=Kooyman GL, Gentry RL, Bergman WP, Hammel HT |year=1976|title= Heat loss in penguins during immersion and compression|journal=Comparative Biochemistry and Physiology |volume=54A |pages=75-80}}</ref>

The Emperor Penguin is able to [[Thermoregulation|thermoregulate]], or maintain core body temperature without altering its metabolism over a wide range of temperatures. Known as the thermoneutral range, this extends from {{convert|-10|<U+00B0>C|<U+00B0>F|sigfig=2}} to {{convert|20|<U+00B0>C|<U+00B0>F|sigfig=2}}. Its metabolism rapidly increases below this, although an individual can maintain its core temperature between {{convert|37.6|<U+00B0>C|<U+00B0>F|sigfig=2}} and {{convert|38|<U+00B0>C|<U+00B0>F|sigfig=2}} down to {{convert|-47|<U+00B0>C|<U+00B0>F|sigfig=2}} .<ref name=Will109>Williams ''(The Penguins)'' p. 109</ref>Movement by swimming (if in water), walking (if on land), and shivering are two mechanisms for increasing metabolism; a third process involves an increase in breakdown of fats by enzymes, which is induced by the hormone [[glucagon]].<ref name=Will110>Williams ''(The Penguins)'' p. 110</ref> At temperatures above {{convert|20|<U+00B0>C|<U+00B0>F|sigfig=2}}, an Emperor Penguin may become agitated as its body temperature and metabolic rate rise to increase heat loss. The raising and exposing the undersides of its flippers increases body surface area by 16%, facilitating further heat loss.<ref name=Will111>Williams ''(The Penguins)'' p. 111</ref>

== Distribution and habitat ==

The Emperor Penguin has a circumpolar distribution, and is found almost exclusively in the Antarctic ranging from 66<U+00BA> to 77<U+00BA> south latitude. It almost always breeds on stable pack ice near the coast and up to {{convert|18|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} offshore.<ref name="ADW">{{citeweb|url=http://animaldiversity.ummz.umich.edu/site/accounts/information/Aptenodytes_forsteri.html|author=University of Michigan Museum of Zoology|title=''Aptenodytes forsteri''|accessdate=2008-01-01}}</ref> Breeding colonies usually occur in sheltered areas where ice cliffs and icebergs protect against the wind.<ref name="ADW"/> Around 80,000 pairs breed in the [[Ross Sea]] sector.<ref>{{cite book |title=Status and Conservation of the World's Seabirds |chapter= The status and conservation of birds in the Ross Sea sector of Antarctica|editor= Croxall JP, Evans PGH, Schreiber RW|author=Harper PC, Knox GA, Wilson GJ, Young EC |year=1984 |publisher=ICBP |location=Cambridge |isbn= |pages=pp. 593-608}}</ref> Major breeding colonies are located at Cape Washington with 20-25,000 pairs, [[Coulman Island]], [[Victoria Land]] with 21,708 pairs, Halley Bay, [[Coats Land]] with 14,300-31,400 pairs, and Atka Bay in [[Queen Maud Land]] with 16,000 pairs.<ref name=Hanzab>{{cite book |title=Handbook of Australian, New Zealand and Antarctic Birds, Vol. 1A |last=Marchant |first=S |coauthors=Higgins PJ |year=1990 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Melbourne |isbn= |pages= }}</ref> Two land colonies have been reported: the first on a shingle spit at Dion Island on the [[Antarctic Peninsula]],<ref>{{cite journal |last=Stonehouse |first=B|year=1953|title=The Emperor Penguin ''Aptenodytes forsteri'' Gray I.

== Behaviour ==

[[Image:Emperor penguin.jpg|right|thumb|Emperor Penguins, [[Ross Sea]], [[Antarctica]]]]
The Emperor Penguin is a social animal, both foraging and nesting in groups. It may be active day or night. A mature adult will travel throughout most of the year between the nesting area and foraging areas in the ocean. From January to March, the species disperses into the oceans, travelling and foraging in groups. It is estimated that there are around 400,000-450,000 Emperor Penguins, distributed into as many as 40 independent Antarctic colonies.<ref name=Hanzab/>

American Gerry Kooyman revolutionized the study of penguin foraging behaviour in 1971 when he published his results from attaching automatic dive recording devices to Emperor Penguins. He found the species had reached depths of {{convert|265|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}. He also noted a maximum dive period of 18 minutes in the same report.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Kooyman GL, Drabek CM, Elsner R, Campbell WB|year=1971|title=Diving behaviour of the Emperor Penguin ''Aptenodytes forsteri'' |journal=Auk |volume=88 |pages=775-95}}</ref> Later research revealed a small female dived to a depth of {{convert|535|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} near [[McMurdo Sound]]. It is possible that it can dive even deeper as the water pressure at these depths impacted on the recording devices.<ref>Williams ''(The Penguins)'' p. 89</ref> The male and female Emperor Penguin forage for food up to {{convert|500|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} from colonies while collecting food to feed chicks, covering anywhere between 82 and 1454&nbsp;km (51 and 904&nbsp;miles) per individual trip. A male returning to the sea after incubation will head directly out to areas of permanent open water, known as [[polynya]]s, around {{convert|100|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} from the colony.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Ancel A, Kooyman GL, Ponganis PJ, Gendner JP, Lignon J, Mestre X|year=1992|title=Foraging behaviour of Emperor Penguins as a resource detector in Winter and Summer |journal=Nature |volume=360 |pages=336-39}}</ref>

[[Image:EmperorPenguinColonyClose.jpg|left|thumb|Emperor Penguin colony]]
Its swimming speed is 6 to 9&nbsp;km/h (4 to 6&nbsp;mph), but they can achieve up to 19&nbsp;km/h (12&nbsp;mph) in short bursts. On land, the Emperor Penguin alternates between walking with a wobbling gait and sliding over the ice on its belly, propelled by its feet and wing-like flippers.

As a defence against the cold, the colony of Emperor Penguins forms a compact huddle (also known as the turtle formation) ranging in size from ten to many hundreds of birds, with each bird leaning forward on a neighbour. Those on the outside tend to shuffle slowly around the edge of the turtle, producing a slow churning action, and giving each bird a turn on the inside and the outside.<ref>Pinshow B., Fedak M.A. , Battles D.R, & Schmidt-Nielsen K. (1976) "Energy expenditure for thermoregulation and locomotion in emperor penguins" ''American Journal of Physiology'' '''231'''(3): 903-912</ref>

=== Diet ===

The diet consists mainly [[fish]], [[crustacean]]s and [[cephalopod]]s,<ref>Cherel Y. & Kooyman G. L. (1998) "Food of emperor penguins ( ''Aptenodytes forsteri'' ) in the western Ross Sea, Antarctica" ''Marine Biology'' '''130'''(3): 335-344 <small>doi:10.1007/s002270050253</small></ref> though its exact composition varies from population to population, but fish is usually the most important food source, and Antarctic silverfish, ''[[Pleuragramma antarcticum]]'', is often the most important species of fish eaten. The Emperor Penguin searches for prey in the open water of the [[Southern Ocean]] or in ice-free areas of open water and tidal cracks in pack ice.<ref name="ADW"/> One of its feeding strategies is to dive to around {{convert|50|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}, where it can easily spot the sub-ice fish, ''[[Pagothenia borchgrevinki]]'', swimming against the under surface of the sea-ice, which it then catches. It then dives again and repeats the sequence about half a dozen times before surfacing to breathe. The Emperor Penguin may also blow bubbles into the cracks in the ice to drive out the hiding fish.

=== Predators ===

[[Image:Skua over penguins chicks.jpg|right|thumb|Skua flying over Emperor Penguin chicks, [[Ross Sea]], [[Antarctica]]]]
The Emperor Penguin's predators include birds and aquatic mammals; the [[Southern Giant Petrel]] (''Macronectes giganteus'') is the main bird predator, responsible for up to 34% of chick deaths at some colonies. The [[South Polar Skua]] (''Stercorarius maccormicki'') mainly scavenges, as the chicks are too large to be attacked by the time of its annual arrival in the colony.<ref>Williams ''(The Penguins)'' p. 40</ref>

The primary aquatic mammal predators are the [[Leopard Seal]] (''Hydrurga leptonyx''), which takes fledglings soon after entering the water as well as some adult birds,<ref name=Kooy90>{{cite journal |author=Kooyman GL, Croll DA, Stone S, Smith S|year=1990|title=Emperor penguin colony at Cape Washington, Antarctica |journal=Polar Record |volume=26 |issue=157 |pages=103-08}}</ref> and the [[orca]] (''Orcinus orca''), which takes adult birds.<ref>{{cite book |title=Ecologie du manchot empereur |last=Pr<U+00E9>vost |first=J|year=1961 |publisher=Hermann |location=Paris}}</ref>

=== Courtship and reproduction ===

[[Image:PENGUIN LIFECYCLE H.JPG|left|thumb|300px|The life-cycle of the Emperor Penguin]]
The Emperor Penguin is able to breed at around three years of age, and usually commences breeding around 1-3 years later.<ref name=Will159>Williams ''(The Penguins)'' p. 159</ref> The yearly reproductive cycle begins at the start of the Antarctic winter, in March and April, when all mature Emperor Penguins travel to colonial nesting areas, often walking 50 to 120&nbsp;km (31 to 75&nbsp;mi) inland from the edge of the pack ice.<ref name=Will158>Williams ''(The Penguins)'' p. 158</ref> The trigger appears to be decreasing daylength; Emperor Penguins in captivity have been induced successfully into breeding by using lighting systems mimicking seasonal Antarctic daylength.<ref>{{cite journal |last= |first= |authorlink= |coauthors= |year= |month= |title=The endocrine control of reproduction and molt in male and female Emperor (''Aptenodytes forsteri'') and Ad<U+00E9>lie (''Pygoscelis adeliae'') Penguins. I. Annual changes in plasma levels of gonadal streroids and luteinizing hormone. |journal=Gen. Comp. Endocrinol |volume=62 |pages=43-53}}</ref>

The penguins start courtship in March or April, when the temperature can be as low as <U+2013>40[[Celsius|<U+00B0>C]] (-40[[Fahrenheit|<U+00B0>F]]). A lone male will give an ecstatic display, where it stands still and places its head on its chest before inhaling and giving a courtship call for 1-2&nbsp;seconds; it then moves around the colony and repeats the call. A male and female will stand face to face, one extending its head and neck up and the other mirroring it before both hold this posture for several minutes. Once in pairs, couples will waddle around the colony together, with the female usually following the male. Before copulation, one bird will bow deeply to its mate, its bill pointed close to the ground, and its mate will do the same.<ref name=Will157/>

Emperor Penguins are [[serial monogamy|serially monogamous]]. They have only one mate each year, and stay faithful to that mate. However, fidelity between years is only about 15%.<ref name=Will157/> The narrow window period available for mating appears to be an influence, as there is a priority to mate and breed which often precludes waiting for the previous year's partner.<ref name=Will55>Williams ''(The Penguins)'' p. 55</ref>

[[Image:Aptenodytes forsteri egg hg.jpg|thumb|right|The egg of the Emperor Penguin. It is 12x8cm and vaguely pear-shaped.]]
The female penguin lays one 460-470&nbsp;[[gram]] (1&nbsp;lb) [[egg (biology)|egg]] in May or early June;<ref name=Will157>Williams ''(The Penguins)'' p. 157</ref> it is pyriform (pear-shaped) and pale greenish-white in colour and measures around 12 x 8&nbsp;cm.<ref name=Will158/> It represents just 2.3% of its mother's body weight, one of the smallest eggs relative to maternal weight of any bird species.<ref name=Will23>Williams ''(The Penguins)'' p. 23</ref> 15.7% of the weight of an Emperor Penguin egg is shell; like those of other penguin species, the shell is relatively thick to minimise risk of breakage.<ref name=Will24>Williams ''(The Penguins)'' p. 24</ref> 

At this point the mother's nutritional reserves are exhausted and she immediately returns to the sea to feed for two months.<ref name=Will158/> Very carefully, she transfers the egg to the male, who [[avian incubation|incubates]] the egg in his brood pouch for 64 days consecutively until hatching.<ref name=Will157/> The Emperor Penguin is the only species where this behaviour is observed, as both parents take shifts incubating in all other species.<ref>Williams ''(The Penguins)'' p. 27</ref> By this time the male will have fasted for around 115&nbsp;days since arriving at the colony.<ref name=Will157/> The transfer of the egg can be awkward and difficult, and many couples drop the egg in the process. When this happens, the chick inside is immediately lost as the egg cannot withstand the low temperatures on the icy ground. To survive the cold and winds of up to 200&nbsp;km/h (120&nbsp;mph), the males huddle together, taking turns in the middle of the huddle. They have also been observed with their backs to the wind to conserve body heat. In the four months of incubation the male may lose as much as 20kg going from around 38kg to just 18kg.

Hatching may take up to 2-3&nbsp;days to complete, and chicks are born [[altricial|semi-altricial and nidicolous]]. In other words, they have only a thin covering of down and are entirely dependent on their parents for food and warmth.<ref name=Will28/> The young chick is brooded in what is called the ''guard phase'', spending its time balanced on its parents' feet and sheltered by its pouch.<ref name=Will28>Williams ''(The Penguins)'' p. 28</ref> If the chick hatches before the mother's return, the father feeds it a curd-like substance composed of 59% [[protein]] and 28% [[lipid]], which is produced by a gland in his [[esophagus]].<ref>{{fr icon}} {{cite journal |author=Pr<U+00E9>vost J, Vilter V |year=1963|title=Histologie de la s<U+00E9>cr<U+00E9>tion oesophagienne du Manchot empereur |journal=Proceedings of the XIII International Ornithological Conference|pages=1085-94}}</ref>

[[Image:EmperorPenguinFeedingChick.jpg|right|thumb|Emperor Penguin feeding a chick]]
The female penguin returns any time from hatching to ten days afterwards, from mid-July to early August.<ref name=Will158/> She finds her mate among the hundreds of fathers via his call and takes over caring for the chick, feeding it by regurgitating the food that she has stored in her stomach. The male then leaves to take his turn at sea, spending around 24&nbsp;days there before returning.<ref name=Will158/> His trip is slightly shorter than before, because the melting of ice in the summer gradually decreases the distance between the breeding site and the open sea. About 45-50&nbsp;days after hatching, the chicks form a [[cr<U+00E8>che (zoology)|cr<U+00E8>che]], huddling together for warmth and protection while still fed by their parents.<ref name=Will158/> A cr<U+00E8>che may comprise up to several thousand birds densely packed together and is essential for surviving the low Antarctic temperatures.<ref name=Will30>Williams ''(The Penguins)'' p. 30</ref>

Chicks begin moulting from early November into juvenile plumage, which takes up to two months and is often not completed by the the time they leave the colony. Adults also cease feeding them during this time. All birds make the considerably shorter trek back to the sea in December or January and spend the rest of the summer feeding there.<ref>{{cite journal|author= |year=1991|title=Moulting starvation in emperor pengion (''Aptenodytes forsteri'') |journal=Polar Biology |volume=11|pages=253-58}}</ref><ref name=Kooy90/>

== Relationship with humans ==

=== Cultural references ===

The Emperor Penguin has been the subject of several documentaries. In 1993, the species was featured in the [[BBC]] series ''[[Life in the Freezer]]'', presented by [[David Attenborough]]. In 2005, the French documentary ''La Marche de l'empereur'', released as ''[[March of the Penguins]]'' in the United States, told the story of the penguins' reproductive cycle.<ref>{{fr icon}} {{cite web |url=http://empereur.luc-jacquet.com/index_flash.htm |title=La Marche de l'empereur, un film de Luc jacquet |accessdate=2008-03-19|work=Official Site (French) }}</ref> The BBC and Attenborough covered the Emperor again in the 2006 series ''[[Planet Earth (TV series)|Planet Earth]]''. [[Apsley Cherry-Garrard]], the Antarctic explorer, said: "Take it all in all, I do not believe anybody on Earth has a worse time than an Emperor Penguin."<ref>Apsley Cherry-Garrard. From the Introduction to The Worst Journey in the World.</ref> The computer-animated movie ''[[Happy Feet]]'' (2006) features Emperor Penguins as its primary characters, with one in particular that loves to dance, depicting them as endangered by a shrinking food supply. The computer-animated movie ''[[Surf's Up (film)|Surf's Up]]'' (2007) features a surfing Emperor Penguin named Zeke "Big-Z" Topanga.

=== Conservation status ===

The Emperor Penguin is listed as least concern by the [[IUCN]]. Along with nine other species of penguin, it is currently being considered for placement under the US [[Endangered Species Act]]. The primary reasons for this are declining food availability due to the effects of [[climate change]], and industrial fisheries on the crustacean and fish populations. Other reasons for their placement on this list include disease, introduced predators (this is more so for the other species of penguin than it is the Emperor), habitat destruction, and disturbance at breeding colonies by humans. Of particular concern is the impact of disturbance caused by [[tourism]].<ref>Burger J. & Gochfeld M. (2007) "Responses of Emperor Penguins (''Aptenodytes forsteri'') to encounters with ecotourists while commuting to and from their breeding colony". ''Polar Biology'' '''30'''(10): 1303-1313 <small>doi:10.1007/s00300-007-0291-1</small> </ref>

Populations declines of 50% in the Terre Ad<U+00E9>lie region have been noted due to increased adult mortality especially of males during abnormally warm periods (in the late 1970s) with reduced sea-ice extent. On the other hand egg hatching success reduced when the sea-ice extent increased. The species is therefore considered as very sensitive to climatic changes.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Emperor penguins and climate change.|last=Barbraud|first=C.|coauthors=Weimerskirch H.|journal=Nature|year=2001|volume=411|issue=6834|pages=183-186|id=PMID 11346792}}</ref>
