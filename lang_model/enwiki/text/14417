==The Seekers==
{{main|The Seekers}}
Bruce Woodley had a 'residency' performing at the Treble Clef restaurant in [[Prahran]]. With former schoolmates, [[Athol Guy]] and [[Keith Potger]], he formed a [[folk music]] trio, The Escorts, in the early 1960s.<ref name="Miles"/> With the arrival of vocalist [[Judith Durham]] in 1962 they became [[The Seekers]], which had some success in Australia before travelling to [[London]] in 1964 and recording four international hit singles written and produced by Tom Springfield.<ref name="Miles"/> Woodley played [[guitar]], [[banjo]], and [[mandolin]], as well as one of the four-part vocal harmony.<ref name="Miles"/> While Durham sang the majority of lead vocals for the group, Woodley usually handled the male lead vocals, including a number of album tracks. The Seekers first disbanded in 1968.<ref name="Miles"/>

During 1965, while in London, Woodley met [[Paul Simon]], just prior to the success of [[Simon and Garfunkel]].<ref name="Miles"/> Simon and Woodley co-wrote the million-selling "[[Red Rubber Ball]]"<ref name="APRA RedRubber">{{cite web|publisher=Australasian Performing Right Association (APRA)|title="Red Rubber Ball" at APRA search engine|url=http://www.apra-amcos.com.au/worksearch.axd?q=Red%20Rubber%20Ball|accessdate=1 November 2009}}</ref>&mdash;later a #1 hit for US group [[The Cyrkle]].<ref name="Miles"/> The Simon and Woodley collaboration also provided "[[I Wish You Could Be Here]]"<ref name="APRA IWishYou">{{cite web|publisher=Australasian Performing Right Association (APRA)|title="I Wish You Could Be Here" at APRA search engine|url=http://www.apra-amcos.com.au/worksearch.axd?q=I%20Wish%20You%20Could%20Be%20Here|accessdate=1 November 2009}}</ref> and "[[Cloudy (song)|Cloudy]]".<ref name="APRA Cloudy">{{cite web|publisher=Australasian Performing Right Association (APRA)|title="Cloudy" at APRA search engine|url=http://www.apra-amcos.com.au/worksearch.axd?q=Cloudy|accessdate=1 November 2009}}</ref> The Seekers later recorded these three songs, and "Cloudy" became an album track on Simon and Garfunkel's hit 1966 [[LP album|LP]] ''[[Parsley, Sage, Rosemary and Thyme]]''&mdash;the only Simon and Woodley song to appear on both group's album.<ref name="Miles"/> However, Woodley's relationship with Simon had deteriorated and Woodley later struggled to get his share of the [[royalties]]&mdash;his songwriting credit on "Cloudy" was omitted from the release of ''Parsley, Sage, Rosemary and Thyme''.<ref name="Miles"/>

==Going solo==
Bruce's first solo venture was a production company called Pennywheel, which saw him release a number of products for children, including a "Build an Alphabet" set of blocks and the 1969 [[Extended play|EP]] & board book "Friday St. Fantasy".  In 1969 Bruce headed off to [[United States|America]] to sell the songs he'd been writing, and was to remain there for several years.  During this period he collaborated with a number of writers including [[John Farrar]]  and Australian folk singer [[Hans Poulsen]].  Their composition "Boom-Sha-La-La-Lo" became a hit for Poulsen.

In 1971 Bruce released his first solo album, entitled ''Just Good Friends''. In a reaction to the folk stereotype of the Seekers, the original album cover featured two naked models having sex.  This was deemed too raunchy for Australia and the cover was replaced by a photo of Woodley.  The original cover, however, was allowed in [[New Zealand]], and this version of the album is a collectors item today.  Three years later Bruce contributed to an Australian-themed album put out by Viscount cigarettes, called ''The Roaring Days Vol. 1'' (after a [[Henry Lawson]] poem).  A second volume never eventuated. He also had a hit song called "Love me tonight baby"  The album featured Bruce performing the traditional folk song "[[Eumerella Shore]]" and some of his own compositions, including "The Bush Girl", which he would later re-record for a double album in 1987, with the Seekers in 1997 and 2000, and with daughter Claire Woodley in 2001.

==Seekers reunions==
Woodley reunited with the Seekers, composed of fellow original members [[Athol Guy]] and [[Keith Potger]], and 23 year old Dutch-born Louisa Wisseling (a semi-professional folk singer formerly with [[Melbourne]] band The Settlers).  In a February 1975 newspaper article about the group's reunion, Louisa revealed that Bruce had approached her at a 1974 Settlers concert at [[Ferntree Gully]]'s [[Swagman Restaurant]] with an offer to join the group, and she originally turned him down.  The new group recorded two albums and a number of singles, some of which, like "The Nimble Song" and "I Saw It All With Trans Tours" (both written by Woodley) reflected the boys' other careers in advertising.  Woodley's composition "The Sparrow Song" became the group's biggest hit and remains to this day the highest-charting Seekers single written by a member of the group.  Other tracks he contributed to this line-up included "Giving and Takin'" (the title track of their second album), "Can We Learn to Get Along" (which began life as a solo recording for the TV [[Documentary film|documentary]] series ''Shell's Australia'', and was released by Bruce on [[flexi-disc]]), "Reunion", "Country Ros", "Standing on Shaky Ground" (featuring Bruce on vocals which he felt were too low for him, but were impossible for Louisa to sing for the same reason), and "The Rose and the Briar".  

In 1977 Bruce left the group and was replaced by Buddy England.  He continued to focus on song-writing and advertising, producing many TV [[jingle]]s including one for Courage beer.  A solo (advertising) single was called "The ANZ Bank Travelling Man", and was given out free to employees of that institution as part of the promotion.

==''I Am Australian''==
1987 saw Bruce involved in the preparations for the [[Australian Bicentenary]], and the release of an Australian-themed double album, songbook and cassette tape, featuring covers of traditional songs and some of Bruce's own compositions.  The set was called ''[[I Am Australian]]'', after a jingle that he wrote to tie together the various threads of the project, tapping into the need he perceived for a national song in which people could take pride.  One of his colleagues on the project was [[Dobe Newton]] of [[the Bushwackers]], who helped compose the words of the title song; another was noted folk singer [[Rose Bygrave]].  The recordings also featured a children's choir including Claire Woodley.

The following year he reunited with [[The Seekers]], this time featuring [[Julie Anthony (Australian singer)|Julie Anthony]] as the lead vocalist, to perform "The Carnival is Over" at [[Expo '88]] and a musical about the Seekers' journey.  This line-up released an album in 1989; "Live On", the title track, was composed by Bruce, as were many of the other new tracks like "The Streets of Serenade" (which charted the story of the Seekers rather more blatantly than his '70s composition "Reunion"), "One Step Forward, Two Steps Back", "How Can a Love So Wrong Be So Right" and "Taking My Chances With You".  When Julie left to have a baby (daughter Tamara), former ''Young Talent Time'' singer [[Karen Knowles]] joined the group.  The only studio recordings by this line-up are the Bruce Woodley written songs "Fools Tonight" and "Bright Star", sold as a cassingle at concerts.  "Bright Star", originally written for Julie's voice, was also performed by both the Julie- and Karen-led Seekers at [[Carols by Candlelight]].

When original vocalist [[Judith Durham]] returned to the Seekers fold in late 1992 for the group's 25 Year Silver Jubilee, the theme song and CD-Single of the reunion was Bruce's composition "[[Keep A Dream in Your Pocket]]".  A 1993 live album and DVD followed, featuring many of the group's hits and a song which would become one of their best known and most-loved, known and sung by  children around the country, Woodley's "[[I Am Australian]]".  

The success of "I Am Australian" was to take Bruce completely by surprise.  In 1991 he performed it with Karen and the Australian Children's Choir on a televised drought appeal, featuring a new, drought themed verse which has not appeared on other recordings.  "I Am Australian" has featured in all Bruce's solo tours and all Seekers tours since the reunion with Judith Durham; in 2000 the Seekers performed a condensed version at the televised Australia Day concert.  Many artists have covered the song; in 1997 Judith released a version with [[Russell Hitchcock]] and [[Mandawuy Yunupingu]] which entered the Australian charts. For many, it has become the unofficial anthem, and is a staple performed at many national events, by such artists as [[Jon Stevens]], [[Delta Goodrem]] and naturally Bruce and the Seekers.  At the 2001 celebrations for the Centenary of Federation Bruce performed the song with daughter Claire (now known for performing the song solo at many events herself) and co-writer [[Dobe Newton]].   

Bruce divorced in the '80s after a 14 year marriage, and he and former wife Sally have two children, Claire and a son, Dan.  With Claire, a burgeoning singer-songwriter in her own right who has performed on the cabaret and conference circuit, he recorded a CD in 2001 called, once again, "I am Australian".  He has since recorded an [[ANZAC]] themed version of "I am Australian", titled "The Anzac Song", and appeared on Melbourne radio advertising the release of a CD-Single several weeks before [[Anzac Day]] in 2005.  Apparently due to production difficulties, it never eventuated.  In 2005 Bruce was interviewed by music journalist Debbie Kruger for a new book entitled ''Songwriters Speak'', focusing on influential and successful Australian singer-songwriters.

At the National Day of Mourning on 22 February 2009 for the victims of the [[Black Saturday bushfires|Victoria bushfires]] Bruce Woodley unveiled 2 new verses for this beautifully stirring song.<ref>{{cite news|url= http://www.news.com.au/heraldsun/story/0,21985,25091011-24218,00.html|title= Promising to remember|publisher= Melbourne Herald Sun|date= 23 February 2009}}</ref>

==Other work==
Bruce's non-musical work includes public speaking through the Saxton Speakers Bureau, and he is the patron of various organisations such as the NIYPAA ([[National Institute of Youth Performing Arts Australia]]).  He is also a member of the Advisory Board of the organisation [[TLC for Kids]], and was for a time, beginning in 1997, the chairman of the Victorian branch of the [[Variety Club]].
