'''''Phantom Phorce''''' is a remix album of [[Super Furry Animals]]' 2003 record ''[[Phantom Power (Super Furry Animals album)|Phantom Power]]''. The remixes had previously appeared on the DVD version of ''Phantom Power''<U+2014>they were re-released as ''Phantom Phorce'' on the band's own [[Placid Casual]] label as a way of ensuring the remixers would receive [[royalties]] for the tracks.<ref name=NMEl>{{cite web|last=|first=|title=FURRY VISION!|work=[[NME]]|date=2004-04-01|url=http://www.nme.com/news/super-furry-animals/16462|accessdate=2004-05-23}}</ref> The album features a commentary from the fictional 'Kurt Stern' who appears between songs to discuss the re-recording of ''Phantom Power'' under his guidance after being unhappy with the original.<ref name=IncendiaryMagazine>{{cite web|last=Foster|first=Richard|title=Incendiary interview Super Furry Animals|work=Incendiary Magazine|date=2005-10-10|url=http://www.incendiarymag.com/modules.php?name=News&file=article&sid=701|accessdate=2008-07-08}}</ref> First editions of the album came packaged in a case that doubled as a paper model of a [[video game arcade cabinet]], and included a bonus CD; the ''[[Slow Life]]'' EP. Critical reaction to ''Phantom Phorce'' was generally positive.

==Origins, concept and music==

''Phantom Phorce'' features remixes previously available on the DVD version of ''[[Phantom Power (Super Furry Animals album)|Phantom Power]]''. According to [[drum kit|drummer]] [[Dafydd Ieuan]] the band didn't have the money to pay the artists involved for these remixes so, in order to provide them with [[royalties]], promised to release an album featuring the tracks on their own label.<ref name=NMEl />

The record features remixes of every track from 2003's ''[[Phantom Power (Super Furry Animals album)|Phantom Power]]'' presented in sequence, along with extra versions of "Valet Parking" and "[[Hello Sunshine]]" which appear at the end of the album. The remixes vary from radical reworkings such as [[Killa Kella]]'s [[beatboxing|beatbox]] treatment of "[[Golden Retriever (song)|Golden Retriever]]" and Wauvenfold's "unrecognisable" version of "Sex, War and Robots",<ref name=Pitchfork>{{cite web|last=Miller|first=Derek|title=Super Furry Animals: Phantom Phorce|work=[[Pitchfork Media]]|date=2004-09-20|url=http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/article/record_review/22147-phantom-phorce|accessdate=2009-03-08}}</ref><ref name=PopMatters>{{cite web|last=Lundy|first=Zeth|title=Phantom Phorce|work=[[PopMatters]]|date=2004-07-06|url=http://www.popmatters.com/pm/review/superfurryanimals-phantomphorce|accessdate=2009-03-04}}</ref> to the likes of [[Mario Caldato Jr]]'s take on "Liberty Belle" and [[High Llamas]]' "Valet Parking" which are merely "spruced up".<ref name=Q>{{cite journal|first=Dan|last=Stubbs|title=Phantom Phorce|journal=[[Q (magazine)|Q]]|volume=214|pages=108|month=May|year=2004}}</ref><ref name=Uncut>{{cite web|last=|first=|title=SUPER FURRY ANIMALS - PHANTOM PHORCE|work=[[Uncut (magazine)|Uncut]]|date=2004-10-20|url=http://www.uncut.co.uk/music/super_furry_animals/reviews/7434|accessdate=2009-03-08}}</ref>

The remixes are interspersed with anecdotes from 'Kurt Stern' (actually the band's [[road manager]]) who supposedly made the decision to make these remixes after being unhappy with the original ''Phantom Power''. According to [[bass guitar|bassist]] [[Guto Pryce]] this "running commentary is [[tongue in cheek]], it's our road manager pretending to be a producer, and he ends up sounding like a... twat!"<ref name=IncendiaryMagazine /> These anecdotes give the actual release a different tracklisting from that which appears on the back of the album.

==Release and reception==

[[Image:Super Furry Animals Phantom Phorce Arcade Cabinet.jpg|150px|right|thumb|Initial copies of ''Phantom Phorce'' came in packaging which could be folded into the shape of a [[video game arcade cabinet]].]]

Initial copies of the album came bundled with the ''[[Slow Life]]'' EP in packaging which could be folded into the shape of a [[video game arcade cabinet]], or "personal console" as described on the instructions section of the sleeve. The CDs themselves were housed in individual sleeves designed to look like [[floppy disk#3<U+00BD>-inch floppy disk|3.5" floppy disks]]. Zeth Lundy, reviewing the album for [[PopMatters]], commented that he constructed the arcade cabinet with "sheer geeky delight" while CokeMachineGlow called the packaging "nostalgic but infuriating".<ref name=PopMatters1>{{cite web|last=Lundy|first=Zeth|title=Phantom Phorce|work=[[PopMatters]]|date=2004-07-06|url=http://www.popmatters.com/pm/review/superfurryanimals-phantomphorce|accessdate=2009-03-08}}</ref><ref name=Coke>{{cite web|last=Sinacola|first=Dom|title=Phantom Phorce/Slow Life EP|work=Cokemachineglow|date=2004-10-20|url=http://www.cokemachineglow.com/record_review/2161/super-furry-animals|accessdate=2009-03-08}}</ref> ''Phantom Phorce'' was also issued on gold-coloured [[Gramophone record|vinyl]].<ref name=Discogs>{{cite web|last=|first=|title=Phantom Phorce|work=Discogs|date=2004?|url=http://www.discogs.com/Super-Furry-Animals-Phantom-Phorce/release/1255635|accessdate=2009-03-12}}</ref>

Critical reaction to ''Phantom Phorce'' was generally positive with ''[[Uncut (magazine)|Uncut]]'' stating that the album features an "inspired overhaul" of tracks from ''[[Phantom Power (Super Furry Animals album)|Phantom Power]]'',<ref name=Uncut /> the ''[[Western Mail (Wales)|Western Mail]]'' describing the record as a "mind-bending collection that radically re-works each track from the original record to create something entirely different, but equally appealing" and musicOMH calling it "an innovative and thoroughly enjoyable set of remixes".<ref name=musicOMH>{{cite web|last=Welsh|first=David|title=Super Furry Animals - Phantom Phorce (Placid Casual)|work=musicOMH|date=2004-04-12|url=http://www.musicomh.com/albums/super-furry-animals-2.htm|accessdate=2009-03-08}}</ref><ref name=WesternMail>{{cite web|last=Rees|first=Christopher|title=Super Furry Animals, 'Phantom Phorce' (Placid Casual)|work=[[Western Mail (Wales)|Western Mail]]|date=2004-04-12|url=http://www.walesonline.co.uk/whats-on/entertainment-reviews/music-reviews/2004/04/12/super-furry-animals-phantom-phorce-placid-casual-91466-14141096/|accessdate=2009-03-08}}</ref> Some reviews pointed out that the album compares favourably with other remix albums with ''[[The Guardian]]'' calling ''Phantom Phorce'' "stimulating and often rather beautiful, bucking the trend set by most other self-indulgent and pointless remix albums" and the ''[[NME]]'' stating that "hearing a rock band get the remix treatment is usually a mildly diverting experience rather than a life-changing one. So it's an extremely pleasant surprise to be faced with a whole album of the buggers ... and be thoroughly entertained."<ref name=Guardian>{{cite web|last=Empire|first=Kitty|title=Super Furry Animals, Phantom Phorce|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=2004-04-11|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2004/apr/11/popandrock5|accessdate=2009-03-08}}</ref><ref name=NME2>{{cite web|last=Woodhouse|first=Alan|title=Super Furry Animals: Phantom Phorce|work=[[NME]]|date=2004-04-20|url=http://www.nme.com/reviews/super-furry-animals/7383|accessdate=2009-03-08}}</ref> ''[[Q (magazine)|Q]]'' stated that the commentary by 'Kurt Stern' was one of the best features of the album and ''[[The Times]]'' expressed surprise that these "'amusing interludes' between tracks are actually funny",<ref name=Q /><ref name=Times>{{cite web|last=Edwards|first=Mark|title=Super Furry Animals: Phantom Phorce|work=[[The Times]]|date=2004-04-11|url=http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/music/cd_reviews/article1056818.ece|accessdate=2009-03-08}}</ref> however [[Pitchfork Media]] found that 'Stern' "gets in the way more than he helps" and claimed that, by the time the listener had heard the full album he or she would "likely consider redubbing it without ['Stern's'] contributions".<ref name=Pitchfork /> Reviewing ''Phantom Phorce'' for ''[[CITR-FM#Discorder_magazine|DiSCORDER]]'' magazine, Jordie Yow called it "good, but not exceptional" and claimed that the remixes simply made him want to listen to the original versions of the tracks while website Angry Ape was scathing, calling the album a "bland & uninspiring package to put you off remixes for life" and suggested that it was merely a "cash-in" by the band.<ref name=Discorder>{{cite web|last=Yow|first=Jordie|title=September 2004 reviews|work=[[CITR-FM#Discorder_magazine|DiSCORDER]]|date=September 2004|url=http://www.discorder.ca/oldsite/reviews/04september.html|accessdate=2009-03-08}}</ref><ref name=AngryApe>{{cite web|last=R|first=Dave|title=Super Furry Animals - Phantom Phorce (Placid Casual)|work=Angry Ape|date=2004-04-18|url=http://angryape.com/reviews/2004/04/18/super-furry-animals-phantom-phorce|accessdate=2009-03-08}}</ref>
