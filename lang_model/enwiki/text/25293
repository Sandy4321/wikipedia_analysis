==History==
[[File:Forestry building (1930).jpg|The School of Forestry building was built in commemoration of the school's 20th anniversary.<ref name="100 Years 0.5"/>|thumb|left]]

CFNR traces its roots to the Forest School founded in April 19, 1910 through [[List of Philippine laws|Act]] 1989. It was originally established as a department of the College of Agriculture.<ref name='Forest History'>{{cite web | url = http://old.uplb.edu.ph/cfnr/about/history.html | title = History of CFNR | publisher = University of the Philippines Los Ba<U+00F1>os | accessdate = 2011-05-01}}</ref> All of its early faculty were from the [[Department of Environment and Natural Resources|Bureau of Forestry]]. The Forest School became independent of the College of Agriculture on February 1916 through Act 2578. Since then, directors of the bureau had acted as [[ex officio]] deans of the school.<ref name="100 Years 0"/><ref name = '100 Years 0.5'>{{cite book| pages = 47<U+2013>74 | chapter = Chs. 4-5 | chapterurl = http://www.slideshare.net/frankahilario/100-years-chapters-45 | accessdate = 2011-05-01 | year = 2007 | publisher = University of the Philippines Los Ba<U+00F1>os Alumni Association | location = Los Ba<U+00F1>os, Laguna | isbn = 978-971-547-252-4 | author = Fernando A.

The Forest School changed its name to School of Forestry in 1924 by effect of Act 3095.<ref name="Forest History"/>

Arthur F. Fischer, the School of Forestry's first dean, retired as director of the Bureau of Forestry in February 1936. He was replaced by Florencio Tamesis who, in effect, became the School of Forestry's second dean, as well as its first [[Filipino people|Filipino]] dean.<ref name = '100 Years 0.5'/>

The [[Second World War]] severely devastated the campus. All School of Forestry buildings, including student and faculty houses, were destroyed. Large parts of the [[Mount Makiling|Makiling Forest Reserve]], which is administered by the school, were, likewise, damaged. Only four faculty and five students returned upon the resumption of classes. Classes were held under trees until its buildings could be reconstructed through the help of [[war reparation]] funds worth [[Philippine Peso|<U+20B1>]]59,300 (US$1,380).<ref name="conversion">Approximate conversion value as of May 2011</ref><ref name = '100 Years'>{{cite book | pages = 75<U+2013>122 | chapter = Chs. 6-8 | chapterurl = http://www.slideshare.net/frankahilario/100-years-chapters-68 | accessdate = 2011-05-01 | year = 2007 | publisher = University of the Philippines Los Ba<U+00F1>os Alumni Association | location = Los Ba<U+00F1>os, Laguna | isbn = 978-971-547-252-4 | author = Fernando A.

In 1954, the College of Forestry signed an agreement with [[Cornell University]] for providing academic and financial assistance. The College of Forestry received [[visiting professor]]s from Cornell and grants that were used for construction and forestry research, while faculty and students were awarded scholarships for pursuing [[master's degree]]s at [[United States|US]] universities.<ref name="100 Years"/>

Domingo M. Lantican became the dean of the College of Forestry on May 1966. Lantican implemented a 5-year campus development program which included construction of new buildings and designating areas for [[dormitory|dormitories]] and staff housing.<ref name = '100 Years 2'>{{cite book| pages = 123<U+2013>160 | chapter = Chs. 9-10 | chapterurl = http://www.slideshare.net/frankahilario/100-years-chapters-910 | accessdate = 2011-05-02 | year = 2007 | publisher = University of the Philippines Los Ba<U+00F1>os Alumni Association | location = Los Ba<U+00F1>os, Laguna | isbn = 978-971-547-252-4 | author = Fernando A.

Due to the distance of the Bureau of Forestry in Manila from the Forest School in [[Los Ba<U+00F1>os, Laguna|Los Ba<U+00F1>os]] (about 64 kilometers), directors of the bureau appointed foresters-in-charge to manage the school. The practice continued until 1957.<ref name="100 Years 0.5"/><ref name="100 Years"/>
