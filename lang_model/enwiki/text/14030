'''Joseph C. Palczynski''' was a [[spree killer]] in the suburbs of [[Baltimore, Maryland]] who in March 2000 terrorized residents in the region by killing four people and taking a family of three as hostages in one of the longest one-man standoffs ever known [http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/local/crime/bal-palcyznskigallery,0,2404657.storygallery?coll=bal-local-utility]. The saga ended with two of the hostages escaping and a third being rescued, Palczynski being shot to death by police, and a woman being sentenced to prison for purchasing his weapons.

==Life before the rampage==
In the years before his shooting rampage, Palczynski, an [[electrician]], who was unemployed at the time of the shootings, had a lengthy record of [[domestic violence]] and related crimes. He had been with numerous girlfriends, all of who reported severe abuse. He had been in and out of [[prison]], [[mental institution]]s, and on [[parole]] or [[probation]] on many occasions. 

Palczynski was already wanted for violating his parole at the time of the shootings. Some of his earlier crimes included [[assault]] and [[battery (crime)|battery]], which one time caused one of his ex-girlfriends to miscarry a child the two had conceived, and a standoff in 1992 in [[Idaho]] that lasted 16 hours[http://www.dartcenter.org/dartaward/2001/winner/03.html].

==The killings==
The story came to the public's attention on [[March 7]], 2000, when a triple homicide occurred in the quiet community of Bowley's Quarters near [[Middle River, Maryland]] (a suburb to the east of Baltimore), an area not accustomed to violent crime. George and Gloria Shenk, ages 49 and 50, and their neighbor David Meyers, 42, were shot to death as Palczynski kidnapped his estranged girlfriend, Tracy Whitehead, and made off in his mother's car [http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/local/crime/bal-pal04,0,2419047.story]. The Shenks had been providing a haven for Whitehead, who had been abused by Palczynski and had recently left him and planned to move into her own apartment. Meyers attempted to intervene and prevent Whitehead from being kidnapped.

==Manhunt==
For ten days following the triple shooting, Palczynski was the subject of an intense [[Manhunt (Law Enforcement)|manhunt]] involving every available [[law enforcement]] unit. The officers, using the latest technology and all available equipment, formed a barrier with [[roadblock]]s and other borders, surrounding the area where they believed Palczynski had been. On two separate occasions, Palczynski was able to elude the boundaries and evade capture.

During the evening of Wednesday, [[March 8]], Palczynski killed a fourth victim. Jenifer McDonel, 36, the mother of a 2-year-old boy, was fatally wounded in front of her family during an unsuccessful [[carjacking]] attempt. While Palczynski was unable to steal a vehicle in this attempt (his target vehicle was not the McDonels' car), he later carjacked an 81-year-old woman, who was not injured.

Following the fourth murder, Palczynski, took Whitehead to a nearby [[motel]], where during the night, she escaped unharmed. The motel clerk did not notice the man checking in was Palczynski, but after Palczynski saw the story on the news in the motel room, and realized his [[gun]]s were in the vehicle he had just stolen, which police were looking for, he went outside with Whitehead to retrieve them. As they stepped outside, Whitehead saw a [[police car]], which she ran to, and Palczynski ran into the nearby woods and fled.

Palczynski later held a family in the [[Essex, Maryland|Essex]] area hostage for several hours, having tied them up and terrorized them before setting them free. He was let into their home by their young son, who did not understand the danger Palczynski posed. Police, through local media and automated phone calls, warned area residents. Palczynski's mother also pleaded in the media on multiple occasions for her son to surrender to police.

On Friday, [[March 10]], Palczynski fled to [[Virginia]], where he kidnapped William Louis Terrell and ordered him to transport him back to eastern [[Baltimore County]]. He was believed by investigators to have hitched a ride on a train, though he told Terrell he paid a woman to transport him there. During the kidnapping, he ordered Terrell to drive to a local shopping center that included a [[Best Buy]] and a [[Target Corporation|Target]] and to purchase food and various survival equipment, as well as a [[battery (electricity)|battery]] operated television with a wad of cash Palczynski provided. He threatened Terrell that he would 'shoot whoever was around' if the Terrell did not comply. Police found Terrell in his pickup truck at 3:30 a.m. on Saturday morning after Palczynski released him. Terrell, who used his faith in his survival attempt, had been keeping his promise not to call police [http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/washingtonpost/access/51086995.html?dids=51086995:51086995&FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT&date=MAR+16%2C+2000&author=Raja+Mishra%3B+Fredrick+Kunkle&pub=The+Washington+Post&desc=Fugitive+Visited+His+Old+Haunts%3B+Alleged+Kidnap+Victim+Tells+of+Cruising+Baltimore+Suburbs&pqatl=google]

==Hostage situation==
On Friday, [[March 17]], Palczynski once again surprised investigators when he eluded a boundary and fled to nearby [[Dundalk, Maryland|Dundalk]] to the home of Tracy Whitehead's mother Lynn, her boyfriend Andrew McCord, and their 12-year old son, Bradley McCord. For the following 97 hours, Palczynski held the family hostage in their home, ignoring the requests of law enforcment and negotiators and occasionally firing shots. 

During the standoff, no one was permitted to enter the neighborhood of the hostage situation, an area that police called a 'kill zone.' All area residents were asked to stay at a shelter that was set up at a local [[elementary school]]. Several people who violated the perimeter set up by police were arrested [http://departments.bloomu.edu/crimjust/pages/articles/md_hostage2.htm].

Palczynski presented one demand to officers throughout the ordeal - to speak with Tracy. Police insisted upon denying him this request. They stated it was his only request, and had they granted it, he may kill Whitehead's mother and other hostages while Tracy listened on the phone. During this time, Tracy was kept at an undisclosed location, revealed after the standoff to be a room at a [[Holiday Inn]] that was kept under 24-hour police guard.

On the evening of Tuesday, [[March 21]], the adult hostages took matters into their own hands. Having laced a glass of [[iced tea]] with [[Xanax]], they put Palczynski to sleep, enabling them to escape through a rear window. They left Bradley, who had been sleeping on the kitchen floor, behind with the expectation that police would rescue him. Officers, fearing for the boy's life, burst into the home.

According to officers, Palczynski, who had been lying on top of his weapons, had charged at them. This led officers to fire numerous rounds into Palczynski, killing him.

==Aftermath==
Following the death of Palczynski, an investigation revealed that he was shot by officers 27 times [http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/local/crime/bal-pal17,0,2746731.story]. An autopsy found no traces of any drugs or alcohol other than the Xanax used to knock him out. While doubts lingered in the minds of the public, the shooting was determined by police to be fully justified [http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-537247.html].

Shortly after the shootings, Constance Ann Waugh, then 48, was charged with illegally purchasing firearms for a person she knew was a convicted felon. Waugh, who did not have a prior criminal record, had been paid by Palczynski a day before the triple shooting to purchase the weapons used in his rampage. She was later sentenced to 16 months in prison [http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=NewsLibrary&p_multi=APAB&d_place=APAB&p_theme=newslibrary2&p_action=search&p_maxdocs=200&p_topdoc=1&p_text_direct-0=0F891EECD89DF386&p_field_direct-0=document_id&p_perpage=10&p_sort=YMD_date:D&s_trackval=GooglePM]. She was also ordered in a [[civil lawsuit]] to pay $450,000 to the families of the victims [http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/washingtonpost/access/321515521.html?dids=321515521:321515521&FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT&date=APR+05%2C+2003&author=Jamie+Stockwell&pub=The+Washington+Post&desc=Woman+Partly+Liable+In+Slaying%3B+Md.+Gun+Buyer+Must+Pay+Family&pqatl=google]. After she filed for [[bankruptcy protection]], her [[homeowner's insurance]] policy paid $100,000, which was split between the three families.

After the siege, McCord attempted to collect a $10,000 reward offered in the apprehension of Palczynski, claiming he was the first to call [[9-1-1|911]], resulting in a capture of the suspect. He was turned down, however, because he did not call [[Metro Crime Stoppers]], the tipline that offers the rewards [http://archives.cnn.com/2000/US/03/27/hostage.reward/index.html]. Calling this hotline is required in order to collect any rewards being offered in the capture of a fugitive.

The former hostages also filed a lawsuit against police, alleging that the department failed to protect them [http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-535655.html]. Police stated they had offered various forms of protection to the family, which they all turned down. These included having an officer stay in their house, having a police unit parked in front of their house, and increasing patrols to their neighborhood during the crisis.

The hostages had also been criticized by many for leaving their son behind with Palczynski as they escaped, and expecting police to rescue him.
