'''Mark Robert Michael Wahlberg''' (born [[June 5]], [[1971]]) is an [[Academy Award]]-nominated [[United States|American]] [[actor]] and [[television producer]], formerly known as [[rapper]] [[Marky Mark]]. He has also spent time working as a [[Model (person)|male fashion model]].

==Biography==
===Early life===
He was born in [[Dorchester, Massachusetts|Dorchester]], [[Massachusetts]], the youngest<ref>http://cbs4denver.com/entertainment/entertainment_story_078124235.html</ref> of nine children, with siblings Arthur, Jim, Paul, Robert, Tracey, Michelle, Debbie, and [[Donnie Wahlberg]]. His father, Donald Edward Wahlberg, was a delivery driver, and his mother, Alma Elaine Donnelly, was a nurse; the two divorced in 1982.<ref>http://movies.yahoo.com/movie/contributor/1800024619/bio</ref> His paternal grandfather was of Swedish descent, while the majority of his other ancestry is Irish.<ref>http://www.wargs.com/other/wahlberg.html</ref> Wahlberg had a [[Catholic]] upbringing and attended [[Copley Square]] High School (but never graduated) on [[Newbury Street]] in Boston.

As a teenager, Wahlberg participated in several acts of violence for which he was arrested, later claiming to have been arrested 20-25 times by the [[Boston Police Department]] as a youth.<ref>http://news.yahoo.com/s/nm/20070206/film_nm/oscars_luncheon_dc_1</ref> At 15 he harassed a group of [[African American]] school children on a [[field trip]] by throwing rocks (causing injuries) and shouting racist epithets.<ref>http://thesmokinggun.com/archive/markymark1.html</ref> While under the influence of [[phencyclidine|angel dust]] when he was 16 (and again using racist language) he knocked a [[middle age]]d Vietnamese man unconscious with a wooden stick and left another Vietnamese man permanently blind in one eye. For these crimes Wahlberg was arrested for [[attempted murder]], pled guilty to assault, and spent 45 days in jail at Boston's Deer Island House of Correction.<ref>http://www.modelminority.com/article225.html</ref><ref>http://abcnews.go.com/Nightline/story?id=2509542&page=1 </ref> In yet another incident when he was 21 Wahlberg fractured the jaw of a neighbour in an unprovoked attack.<ref> http://thesmokinggun.com/archive/markymark9.html</ref>

===Career===
Wahlberg first came to fame as the younger brother of [[Donnie Wahlberg]] of the successful [[boy band]] [[New Kids on the Block]].
[[Image:skycover.jpg|thumb|200px|left|[[SKY magazine|SKY Magazine]] cover from November 1993 featuring Wahlberg in his '''Marky Mark''' persona.]]
Wahlberg began recording as '''[[Marky Mark and the Funky Bunch]]''', earning a hit with "[[Good Vibrations (Marky Mark song)|Good Vibrations]]" from the album ''Music for the People''. The record was produced by Donnie and hit #1 on The [[Billboard Hot 100]]. Marky Mark opened for the New Kids during their last [[Selling out|sell-out]] tour.  The second Marky Mark LP, ''You Gotta Believe'', was a relative failure. He briefly became embroiled in controversy when he appeared to endorse the [[homophobic]] comments made by [[Shabba Ranks]] when they appeared as guests on the British [[Talk show|chat show]] ''[[The Word (TV series)|The Word]].'' He later publicly dissociated himself from Ranks' comments, but only after widespread media coverage. In the dedication of his 1992 book "Marky Mark", co-authored with photographer Lynn Goldsmith, Wahlberg says "I wanna dedicate this book to my dick".

Wahlberg was also known for his impressive [[Physical attractiveness#Physique|physique]]. He first displayed it in the ''Good Vibrations'' [[music video]] and most prominently in a series of [[underwear]] ads for [[Calvin Klein]] shot by [[Herb Ritts]].  During concert performances, he was known for stripping to his briefs and grabbing his crotch.  He also made a workout video entitled ''The Marky Mark Workout: Fitness, Form, Focus''. Afterwards he had a few hits in the European dance scene with Prince Ital Joe, which abruptly ended when the latter died in a car accident. He then began an acting career, making his debut in the 1993 [[TV movie]] ''[[The Substitute]]''. He has earned positive reviews and appeared in a number of successful movies like ''[[Boogie Nights]]'', ''[[Three Kings (film)|Three Kings]]'', ''[[The Perfect Storm (film)|The Perfect Storm]]'', ''[[Four Brothers (film)|Four Brothers]]'', and ''[[The Italian Job (2003 film)|The Italian Job]]''.  His performance in ''[[I <U+2665> Huckabees]]'' was voted best supporting performance of the year in the 2004 [[The Village Voice|Village Voice]] Critics Poll. Wahlberg was originally cast as Linus Caldwell in ''[[Ocean's Eleven (2001 film)|Ocean's Eleven]]''; [[Matt Damon]] played the role instead.  The two later worked together in ''[[The Departed]]''.<ref>http://www.filmfodder.com/archive/oceans11</ref> Wahlberg was also originally considered for a role in the film [[Brokeback Mountain]]. The movie was originally intended to star him and [[Joaquin Phoenix]], but Wahlberg was uncomfortable with the film's sex scenes and his role ultimately went to [[Jake Gyllenhaal]].<ref>http://www.notstarring.com/actors/wahlberg-mark</ref>

Wahlberg recently starred in the [[American football|football]] [[drama]], ''[[Invincible (2006 film)|Invincible]]'', based on the true story of [[Vince Papale]]. He is also the [[executive producer]] of the [[HBO]] series ''[[Entourage (TV series)|Entourage]]'' which is loosely based on his experiences in [[Hollywood]]. He also appeared as a [[Massachusetts State Police]] detective in Martin Scorsese's critically acclaimed thriller, ''[[The Departed]]'' in 2006, which netted him an [[Academy Award]] nomination for [[Best Supporting Actor]], a Golden Globe nomination for Best Performance by an Actor in a Supporting Role in a Motion Picture, an [[National Society of Film Critics|NSFC]] Best Supporting Actor award, to mention a few.<ref>http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0407887/awards</ref>

Wahlberg has confirmed that he was approached to star in a sequel to ''The Departed'', but it's still early in development. The sequel would reportedly revolve around the detective played by Wahlberg.<ref>http://www.postchronicle.com/news/original/article_21263043.shtml Article about Wahlberg confirming "Departed 2" in the works Accessed February 9, 2007</ref><ref>http://movies.ign.com/articles/761/761346p1.html IGN.com article about Departed 2 problems Accessed February 9, 2007</ref>

To prepare for his role in ''[[Shooter (2007 film)|Shooter]]'', Wahlberg attended long-range shooting training at [[Front Sight Firearms Training Institute]] near [[Pahrump, Nevada]], and was able to hit a target at 2000 yards.<ref>[http://www.frontsight.com/msn-vid.asp Shooter interview]</ref> He has said in a number of interviews that he will retire at the age of 40.<ref>http://www.realitytvworld.com/news/actor-mark-wahlberg-says-he-plans-retire-at-age-40-1004076.php</ref> He will concentrate on parenthood and [[professional golf]].

===Personal life===
Wahlberg has two children with [[Rhea Durham]]: daughter Ella Rae born on [[September 2, 2003]]; and son Michael, born on March 22, 2006.<ref>http://imdb.com/title/tt0963687/ [[NBC]]'s [[The Tonight Show with Jay Leno]], aired Thursday, February 8, 2007.</ref>

He was a scheduled passenger on [[United Airlines Flight 93]] on [[September 11, 2001]], but decided at the last minute to head up to the [[Toronto International Film Festival]] instead.<ref>http://www.starpulse.com/news/index.php/2006/09/11/a_friend_kept_mark_wahlberg_off_doomed_9</ref><ref>http://www.thestar.com/artsentertainment/article/194160</ref>
