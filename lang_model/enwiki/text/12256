The '''Afghan cricket team''' is a national [[cricket]] team representing [[Afghanistan]]. They have been an Affiliate Member of the [[International Cricket Council|ICC]] since [[2001]], and an Associate Member of the [[Asian Cricket Council]] since [[2003]].

Originally the [[Taliban]] regime in Afghanistan had banned cricket as they had banned most other sports, but in early [[2000]] there was a change of heart and the government wrote to the [[Pakistan Cricket Board]] asking for the PCB's support for an Afghan application to the ICC. 

In [[2001]], the Afghan side took part in a four-match tour of Pakistan, visiting [[Peshawar]] and [[Rawalpindi]], and the team also visited in [[2003]] and [[2004]]. In 2004 Afghanistan played in the [[ACC Trophy]] in [[Kuala Lumpur]] - the regional qualifying competition for the [[ICC Trophy]] - and performed respectably, with the highlight being a surprise win over hosts [[Malaysian cricket team|Malaysia]]. They finished sixth in that tournament, only just missing out on progression along the qualifying path for the [[2007 Cricket World Cup|2007 World Cup]] by one place.

In [[2006]] Afghanistan hosted an [[Marylebone Cricket Club|MCC]] team led by former [[English cricket team|England]] captain [[Mike Gatting]] in a 40-over contest, and the Afghans won by 171 runs with Gatting being dismissed for a duck.{{ref|MCC}}

Later in the year they competed in the ACC Trophy for the second time, and finished in third place, gaining a spot in [[2008 ICC World Cricket League Division Five|Division Five]] of the [[ICC World Cricket League]], which forms part of the qualification pathway to the [[2011 Cricket World Cup|2011 World Cup]].
