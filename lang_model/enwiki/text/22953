"'''The Falcon and the D'ohman'''" is the season premiere of the [[The Simpsons (season 23)|twenty-third season]] of the animated sitcom ''[[The Simpsons]]''. It originally aired on the [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox network]] in the United States on September 25, 2011. In the episode, the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant hires a new security guard named Wayne and [[Homer Simpson|Homer]] soon becomes friends with him. "The Falcon and the D'ohman" also reveals the fate of the relationship between the characters [[Ned Flanders]] and [[Edna Krabappel]] that was initiated in the previous episode of the series, "[[The Ned-Liest Catch]]", that aired in May 2011.

Canadian actor [[Kiefer Sutherland]] guest starred in the episode as the voice of Wayne. This was the third time he appeared on ''The Simpsons''. The episode also features a guest appearance by American chef and ''[[Top Chef]]'' judge [[Tom Colicchio]] as himself in a segment in which Marge dreams about being a contestant in a ''Top Chef'' type of show. "The Falcon and the D'ohman" has received mixed reviews from television critics, with criticism directed at the plot and the cultural references featured. However, a reference in the episode to the computer animated re-enactments of news stories done by the Taiwan-based [[Next Media Animation]] has been particularly praised.

"The Falcon and the D'ohman" features a reference to the previous episode of the series, the [[The Simpsons (season 22)|twenty-second season]] finale "[[The Ned-Liest Catch]]" that aired on May 22, 2011. In that episode, the characters [[Ned Flanders]] and [[Edna Krabappel]] start dating. The episode ends with [[Homer Simpson|Homer]] and [[Marge Simpson]] giving viewers a link to the official ''The Simpsons'' website, TheSimpsons.com, and encouraging them to go on the website and vote over the summer of 2011 on whether Ned and Edna should stay together. The result of the poll was revealed in "The Falcon and the D'ohman"<U+2014>a majority had voted for the couple to remain in a relationship.<ref name="nedna">{{cite web|title=<U+2018>Simpsons<U+2019> Fans Play Cupid For New Springfield Couple <U+2018>Nedna<U+2019>|url=http://www.accesshollywood.com/simpsons-fans-play-cupid-for-new-springfield-couple-nedna_article_48292|work=[[Access Hollywood]]|date=2011-05-20|accessdate=2011-09-09}}</ref> According to executive producer [[Al Jean]], the poll was "very strong in one direction."<ref name=Fienberg/> He assured in an interview before the result was presented that the poll was authentic and the writers would not undo the viewers' decision, and added that "What our fans have joined together, let no writer tear asunder."<ref name=Fienberg>{{cite web|last=Fienberg|first=Daniel|title=Watch: Al Jean talks Season 23 of 'The Simpsons'|url=http://www.hitfix.com/blogs/the-fien-print/posts/watch-al-jean-talks-season-23-of-the-simpsons|publisher=[[HitFix]]|accessdate=2011-09-27|date=2011-09-25}}</ref>

==Plot==
[[Comic Book Guy]] opens up the season premiere by telling the viewers that there will be hints in the episode as to the conclusion of the romance between Ned and Edna. After the revised intro, where Homer sneaks late into work and marks up his time card to make it seem like he was on time and had put in some overtime hours, Homer is surprised to find that a new security guard named Wayne has been hired at the [[Springfield Nuclear Power Plant]]. He repeatedly tries befriending Wayne, only to be coldly shunned at every attempt. Meanwhile, while making crackers for [[Bart Simpson|Bart]] and [[Lisa Simpson|Lisa]], Marge daydreams that she has become a contestant on a cooking show called ''Master Chef'' that is judged by [[Tom Colicchio]], with him praising her for her crackers and giving her the prize of a new kitchen. However, when Marge stops daydreaming and gives the crackers to her children, they tell her they do not like them because they do not like change.  

One day while Wayne is walking home in the rain and hail, Homer sees Wayne and he reluctantly agrees to let Homer drive him to [[Moe's Tavern]] for a drink. But while Wayne is in the bathroom, [[Snake Jailbird]] dramatically crashes through the door on his motorcycle to rob everyone. As soon as Wayne comes out, he soundly beats up Snake. The story spreads quickly and a news segment that features an interview with Wayne by [[Kent Brockman]] and a [[computer animated]] Taiwanese dramatization of the incident at the tavern soon airs on television. It is discovered that Wayne was once a highly-trained [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] [[black ops]] agent, who decided to go into hiding in Springfield. However, he is plagued by recurring flashbacks from his previous missions, which cause him to act or shout them out, as evidenced when he unintentionally attacks [[Mr. Burns]], the boss of the power plant, resulting in Wayne getting fired. 

Homer allows Wayne to stay in Bart's treehouse because Wayne can no longer afford his apartment. One night, Wayne speaks loudly about a past mission in his sleep, causing the couples in the nearby houses to lose sleep. Ned and Edna are one of these couples, and they are shown holding each other in bed.  Unfortunately, news of what happened to Mr. Burns is leaked onto [[YouTube]] and seen by one of Wayne's gangster enemies, named Viktor, in [[Kiev, Ukraine]]. Apparently, Wayne accidentally killed Viktor's wife with a stray bullet on a previous mission. Thus, the Ukrainian gangster and his henchmen kidnap and torture Homer as bait to lure Wayne. Wayne tracks Homer down through [[tracking device]]s he unknowingly ate, frees him and kills all of the Ukrainian gangsters. Afterwards, Wayne decides to leave Springfield, but not before giving Homer the [[fist pound]] Homer wanted when they first met. However, Marge suggests that Wayne get a job at the Springfield [[Department of Motor Vehicles]], and he does. At the DMV, he has a flashback to the time he was a prisoner in [[North Korea]] and was forced to write a ridiculous musical play paying tribute to [[Kim Jong-il]]. During the closing credits of the episode, Ned and Edna thank the fans for voting for their relationship to continue.

"The Falcon and the D'ohman" was written by Justin Hurwitz and directed by [[Matthew Nastuk]].<ref>{{Cite episode |title=The Falcon and the D'ohman  |episodelink= |series=The Simpsons |serieslink=The Simpsons |credits= |network=Fox |station= |airdate=2011-09-25 |season=23|seriesno= |number=1 |minutes=03:55<U+2013>04:01 |quote= |language=}}</ref> The storyline of the episode resembles [[David Cronenberg]]'s film ''[[A History of Violence]]''.<ref name="violence">{{cite web|author=Humanick, Rob|title=The Simpsons: Season 23|url=http://www.slantmagazine.com/tv/review/the-simpsons-season-23/279|publisher=[[Slant Magazine]]|date=2011-09-25|accessdate=2011-11-11}}</ref> "The Falcon and the D'ohman" features several references to [[popular culture]]. For example, in a sequence at the beginning of the episode, Homer sings about working at the power plant to the melody of [[The Police]]'s song "[[Walking On The Moon]]".<ref name=Childs /> According to Chris Ledesma, music editor on ''The Simpsons'', the staff was "very fortunate to have obtained the original master tracks from The Police without vocals. This is a rare instance. When we need to do our own lyrics to an established hit song, [composer [[Alf Clausen]]] usually arranges and records a 'sound-alike' that tries to capture all the spirit and nuance of the original so that the audience immediately identifies the track, but allows us to add our own vocals."<ref name=Ledesma>{{cite web|last=Ledesma|first=Chris|title=Starting 'Treehouse of Horror XXII' and finishing 'The Falcon and the D<U+2019>ohman'|url=http://simpsonsmusic500.wordpress.com/2011/09/26/starting-treehouse-of-horror-xxii-and-finishing-the-falcon-and-the-dohman/|publisher=Simpsons Music 500|accessdate=2011-09-28|date=2011-09-28}}</ref> The episode also made frequent use of the sequence "[[Montagues and Capulets|Dance of the Knights]]" from the ballet ''[[Romeo and Juliet (Prokofiev)|Romeo and Juliet]]'' by [[Serge Prokofiev]]. The sequence had to be licensed, as it was under copyright in most parts of the world.<ref name=Ledesma />

Another cultural reference appears in one of Wayne's flashbacks, in which he is seen receiving special training against enemies such as [[Chucky (Child's Play)|Chucky]] of the ''[[Child's Play (film series)|Child's Play]]'' film series and basketball player [[Kobe Bryant]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Hughes|first=Jason|title=Kiefer Sutherland is a Security Guard With a Secret Past on 'The Simpsons' (video)|url=http://www.aoltv.com/2011/09/26/kiefer-sutherland-security-guard-secret-past-simpsons-video/|publisher=AOL TV|accessdate=2011-09-27|date=2011-09-26}}</ref> The Taiwanese dramatization of Wayne's fight with Snake at Moe's Tavern parodies the humorous computer animated re-enactments of news stories done by the Taiwan-based [[Next Media Animation]].<ref name=Childs>{{cite web|last=Childs|first=Hayden|title='The Falcon And The D<U+2019>OHman'|url=http://www.avclub.com/articles/the-falcon-and-the-dohman,62123/|work=[[The A.V.

Canadian actor [[Kiefer Sutherland]] guest starred in "The Falcon and the D'ohman" as the security guard Wayne.

===Critical reception===
Since airing, "The Falcon and the D'ohman" has received mixed reviews from critics. The plot of the episode has been criticized by some reviewers. Kyle Lemmon of ''[[Under the Radar (magazine)|Under the Radar]]'' gave the episode a three out of ten rating, concluding that "this new episode is rarely grounded in any kind of reality. The best examples of ''The Simpsons'' center the situational humor in somewhat plausible scenarios within the town. I guess after so many years, they've completely run out of ideas."<ref>{{cite web|last=Lemmon|first=Kyle|title=The Simpsons (Season 23 Premiere: <U+201C>The Falcon and the D<U+2019>Ohman<U+201D>)|work=Under the Radar|url=http://www.undertheradarmag.com/reviews/the_simpsons_season_23_premiere/|accessdate=September 26, 2011|date=September 25, 2011}}</ref> Similarly, [[Cinema Blend|Television Blend]]'s Jesse Carp wrote that the plot shows "essentially what is wrong with the show and why I stopped watching. Because of the endless amount of material needed to keep a series running for twenty three years, they have to resort to outlandish plots and endless cameos to stay interesting. The best episodes, [...] definitely have some absurd elements but they're all firmly grounded in a fairly real world of Springfield, USA and its colorful cast of characters. I'd like to see more of that. I miss them."<ref name=Carp>{{cite web|last=Carp|first=Jesse|title=The Simpsons Season Premiere Preview Shows Kiefer Sutherland In Springfield|url=http://www.cinemablend.com/television/Simpsons-Season-Premiere-Preview-Shows-Kiefer-Sutherland-Springfield-34865.html|publisher=[[Cinema Blend{{!}}Television Blend]]|accessdate=2011-09-09|date=2011-09-06}}</ref>

The cultural references featured in the episode have attracted both criticism and praise. The parody of Next Media Animation has been commended by several reviewers.  Hayden Childs of ''[[The A.V. Club]]'' commented that the episode "features a couple of quite funny sight gags, like the [[fresco]] on Moe's ceiling and the delightful Taiwanese dramatization of certain events", but further wrote that the "rest of the jokes and references clang away without being too funny or too insulting, and that is probably the best that any viewers can ask of ''The Simpsons'' in its advanced age."<ref name=Childs /> Television Blend's Steve West commented that the episode was the worst of the Animation Domination lineup that week and further elaborated that the cultural references "are always a year behind, and the smart writers who used classic American culture to bring wit to the series have been replaced by those who want to mimic ''[[South Park]]'' and ''Family Guy''. They fail miserably, and it<U+2019>s gotten so bad that I now no longer care about the relationship between Marge and Homer."<ref>{{cite web|last=West|first=Steve|title=Animation Domination Review: Family Guy Rules The Night|url=http://www.cinemablend.com/television/animation-domination-review-family-guy-rules-night-35391.html|publisher=[[Cinema Blend{{!}}Television Blend]]|accessdate=2011-11-11|date=2011-09-25}}</ref> 

Matt Roush of ''[[TV Guide]]'' wrote more positively about the episode, noting that "Fox's eternal ''The Simpsons'' kicks off a night of all-new animation, welcoming Kiefer Sutherland in a very clever guest role as a security guard trying without much success to escape his violent past. A nod to Taiwanese animation is just one of the highlights in this homage to ''24''-style mayhem."<ref name=Roush>{{cite news|last=Roush|first=Matt|title=Matt's Guide to Weekend TV: New and Returning Shows|url=http://www.tvguide.com/News/Matts-Guide-Weekend-1037981.aspx|accessdate=2011-09-24|newspaper=[[TV Guide]]|date=2011-09-23}}</ref> Similarly, Umika Pidaparthy of [[CNN]]'s The Marquee Blog commented that "there were a lot of light laughs in this episode, like when Wayne walks through the Ukrainian part of Springfield (Tsarbucks, anyone?). Pop culture references like the Taiwanese animation of the robbery were hilarious. I was disappointed, though, to see that Marge's daydream about being on ''Top Chef'' didn't become a side story."<ref name=cnn>{{cite web|last=Pidaparthy|first=Umika|title='The Simpsons' not quite like 'The Simpsons'|url=http://marquee.blogs.cnn.com/2011/09/26/the-simpsons-not-quite-like-the-simpsons/|date=2011-09-26|publisher=The Marquee Blog ([[CNN]])|accessdate=2011-09-26}}</ref>  Mike Hughes of the ''[[Lansing State Journal]]'' commented that the episode was "inconsistent, but [had] great moments", and that it was "much better than Fox's other season-openers" that premiered on the same day.<ref name=Hughes>{{cite news|last=Hughes|first=Mike|title='Simpsons' has great moments|newspaper=[[Lansing State Journal]]|date=2011-09-24}}</ref>
