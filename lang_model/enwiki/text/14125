'''Thomas John "Tom" Lieb''' (October 28, 1899 &ndash; April 30, 1962) was an American Olympic [[Athletics (track and field)|athlete]], All-American [[college football]] player and a multi-sport collegiate coach.

Tom Lieb was born in [[Faribault, Minnesota]] in 1899.  In high school, Lieb excelled at [[baseball]], [[American football|football]], [[Ice hockey|hockey]],  and [[Track and field athletics|track and field]].  He attended the [[University of Notre Dame]] in [[South Bend, Indiana]], where he lettered in all four sports and twice received [[All-American]] football honors.  During the 1922 season, Lieb broke his leg in the game against [[Purdue Boilermakers football|Purdue]].<ref>"[http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?_r=1&res=9B02E4D91E39EF3ABC4E52DFB6678389639EDE  Notre Dame Loses Lieb; Tackle Who Broke Log In Purdue Game Is Out of Football for Season]," ''The New York Times'', p. 22 (October 16, 1922).

Lieb was a two-time [[National Collegiate Athletics Association|NCAA]] champion in the [[shot put]] in 1923 and 1924, and is widely credited with introducing the modern spin delivery that is still used today.<ref>Chris Masters, ed., [http://grfx.cstv.com/photos/schools/nd/sports/c-xc/auto_pdf/0607-track-1-8intro.pdf  ''2006&ndash;07 Notre Dame Cross Country, Track & Field Media Guide''], University of Notre Dame, South Bend, Indiana, p. 5 (2006).</ref>  At the [[1924 Summer Olympics]] held in [[Paris, France]], Lieb competed for the United States in the [[discus throw]] and won the bronze medal, but did not equal the distance of his qualifying throw.<ref name=srlieb>Sports Reference, Olympic Sports, [http://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/athletes/li/tom-lieb-1.html  Tom Lieb].

Lieb's coaching success was recognized when he was offered the head coaching position at [[Loyola Marymount University|Loyola University]] in [[Los Angeles, California]], where he remained from 1930 to 1938.
