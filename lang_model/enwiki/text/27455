== Characters ==
=== Middle school students ===
;{{nihongo|Ayumi Arihara|<U+6709><U+539F><U+3042><U+3086><U+307F>|Arihara Ayumi}}
: A 2nd year middle school second year and the focus of Chapter 1, Ayumi is one day asked out by Misao Zaitzu.  Though she claimed she would accept any offer, she is consistently unsettled by Zaizu's monstrous appearance.  However, she shows she can be somewhat caring as well as crafty. She is 152cm (4'9") tall and runs the second fastest in her class. She's also unusually strong for her size and build, as demonstrated when she knocked out Misao with a single kick.  She falls in love with Misao's younger brother Mamoru after he carries her to the infirmy. At the end, she is trying to decide between the two Zaitzu brothers, whether to choose the one who likes her (Misao) or the one she likes (Mamoru). She shares a strong resemblance to Chinami Hashimoto, a character from another of Kawashita's work, ''[[Strawberry 100%]]''. {{anime voices|Mariya Ise}}<ref name="staff"/>

;{{nihongo|Kei Enomoto|<U+6C5F><U+30CE><U+672C><U+6167>|Enomoto Kei}}
: One of Ayumi's friends, Kei is apparently very popular with guys due to her "mature" face.  However, she sees the attention she receives as a hassle, and believes confessions of love are just a chore if the feeling isn't mutual.  She openly admits that looks are a major factor in choosing a relationship, but carries a love-hate (mostly hate) relationship with Kusuda. But when he confessed his feelings to her, she returned them. She is in the same grade as Ayumi. {{anime voices|Shizuka Itou}}<ref name="staff"/>

;{{nihongo|Koyoi Bessho|<U+5225><U+6240><U+5C0F><U+5BB5>|Bessho Koyoi}}
: Another one of Ayumi's friends, Koyoi has an open [[Genetic sexual attraction|brother complex]] with her brother Yoshihiko. Once Misao starts hanging around, she, along with Chikura, stop walking home with Ayumi. She is also in the same grade as Ayumi. Since her brother likes Misaki, a popular and attractive girl, she regards her as a "Final Boss" that she must defeat. She also quotes that Misaki's chest is a "truly evil power." {{anime voices|Aki Toyosaki}}<ref name="staff"/>

;{{nihongo|Rika Dobashi|<U+571F><U+6A4B><U+308A><U+304B>|Dobashi Rika}}
: Seemingly the most level headed out of the group, Rika seems to enjoy teasing others. A well known tom-boy, she excels in athletics and has been stated to be domineering. She is in the same grade as Ayumi. She became close to tennis player Terai when he started physical training with her, and over time became attracted to him, but didn't give him that impression at first, thinking that was all there was to have a relationship. However, after Kei explained to her about what boys think and feel, Rika became more overt about her feelings, and surprised Terai with a kiss, and furthermore, after the runaway incident by some of the boys, she admits that if Terai also ran away, she "absolutely won't like it". {{anime voices|Minako Kotobuki}}<ref name="staff"/>

;{{nihongo|Nao Chikura|<U+5343><U+5009><U+540D><U+592E>|Chikura Nao}}
:{{anime voices|Ayumi Fujimura}}<ref name="staff"/>
:Another one of Ayumi's friends, Nao is somewhat envious of Kei's attention. Along with Koyoi, she stops walking home with Ayumi for fear of Misao. She is in her 2nd year of middle school. Being a member of the art club, she came to admire the artist who made the painting of a Sakura tree, Renjou Yukito, and after meeting him, asked him to assist her in making her own painting. However, upon his graduation, he left Japan, leaving her broken hearted. When she learned about Hiroyuki Sogabe's feelings towards her, she became close to him. She shares a strong resemblance to Misuzu Sotomura, a character from another of Kawashita's work, ''[[Strawberry 100%]]''.

;{{nihongo|Mamoru Zaitsu|<U+8CA1><U+6D25><U+885B>|Zaitsu Mamoru}} 
:A cheerful boy who dreams of being a paramedic, Ayumi falls for Mamoru quickly when he offers to take her to the nurse.  Although he is in Ayumi's class, Ayumi only realizes that he is in fact Misao's younger brother a day after she meets Misao.  He is somewhat taken back by Ayumi; he believes she is more fearsome than she may appear.  Furthermore, despite Ayumi's feelings, Mamoru has a crush on his next door neighbor Misaki Yamamoto. He later runs away with Kusuda and Sogabe after he was turned down by Misaki. He then has a change of heart after realizing he made Ayumi cry due to his actions. He shares a passing resemblance to Kojima, a character from another of Kawashita's work, ''[[Lilim Kiss]]'', as well as Manaka Junpei from ''[[Strawberry 100%]]''. {{anime voices|Miyu Irino}}<ref name="staff"/>

;{{nihongo|Kusuda|<U+6960><U+7530>|Kusuda}}
: He is a pervy friend of Mamoru's. His talent is putting girls to sleep with stupid puns. He doesn't see much in Ayumi, but he is very interested in Misaki; he is nearly obsessed with her.  He seems undaunted by Kei's good looks, and with his "Kappa" face, they tend to bicker a lot. He runs away fron home with Mamoru and Sogabe, because he regrets saying he hates Kei. In the end, he confesses to Kei and finds his feelings reciprocated. {{anime voices|Shintaro Asanuma}}<ref name="staff"/>

;{{nihongo|Terai|<U+5BFA><U+4E95>|Terai}}
:A member of the tennis club at school, Terai has little athletic ability.  However, with Dobashi's assistance, he manages to become a somewhat decent athlete.  During that time, he has fallen for Dobashi, but due to her (inadvertent) teasing, plus the fact that she avoided holding hands with him (to which she revealed that she found it embarrasing to do so), he is unsure of their relationship. Eventually, he gets a kiss from Dobashi, which affirms their relationship.

;{{nihongo|Hiroyuki Sogabe|<U+66FD><U+6211><U+90E8> <U+5F18><U+4E4B>|Sogabe Hiroyuki}}
: He is a friend of Kusuda. Sogabe is a bit of a delusional character, as well as a little narcissistic. He likes Nao and tries to get close to her to ''create'' an opportunity for her to confess to him.  He shows his insecurities when Nao shows interest towards Yukito Renjou, an artist and graduated student from their school. He runs away from home because of this (although only for two days) with Kusuda and Mamoru. After he loudly admits his feelings towards Nao such that she hears it (after she and the other girls pursue the runaways), the two become close. Near the end of the series, he cuts his hair. {{anime voices|Takahiro Sakurai}}<ref name="staff"/>

;{{nihongo|Soako Andou|<U+5B89><U+85E4><U+305D><U+3042><U+3053>|Andou Soako}}
: A second year middle school student, Soako is the heroine of the [[Omake]] of the first printed volume of Hatsukoi Limited. The first introduction of Soako is when she is late for school. Unfortunately for Soako, in her lateness, she has forgotten to put on underwear. The story follows her throughout the day, and all the problems that she has. {{anime voices|Saori Goto}}<ref name="staff"/>

;{{nihongo|Sumire Fudounomiya|Fudounomiya Sumire}}
:A middle school student who is the head of the Theatre Club. She is determined on producing the best stage-performance since her taking the position. She has hers sights set on making Kusuda join the production due to his kappa-like looks and will resort to any means necessary (albeit very dirty) to achieve it.

=== High school students ===
;{{nihongo|Misao Zaitsu|<U+8CA1><U+6D25><U+64CD>|Zaitsu Misao}}
: With a monstrous face and a huge body, Misao is feared by anyone who sees his face or knows his name (with the exception of his childhood friend and neighbor, Misaki Yamamoto).  As expected, he is a capable fighter with plenty of enemies.  However, he is also unexpectedly shy; being unable to convey his feelings through words, he writes his confession on a note, and he is unable to bring himself to even say Ayumi's name.  He fell for Ayumi when he saw her picture while looking through his brother's class photos. After Ayumi made him realize that he scares her, he decided to watch over her at a distance. At the end when Ayumi realizes his good intentions, she tells him her "answer", that she will need to decide between him and his brother Mamoru. Misao understands this, and also decides Mamoru is his rival. He is a stark 194cm (6'3") tall. He seems to be similar to Migishima, another character from Kawashita's work, Strawberry 100%, due to being intimidating despite his good intentions. {{anime voices|Kenji Nomura}}<ref name="staff"/>

;{{nihongo|Yuuji Arihara|<U+6709><U+539F><U+6709><U+4E8C>|Arihara Yuuji}}
: Ayumi's older brother who can be somewhat callous and rude.  For example, he steals her cookies and barges into her room without knocking.  The opposite to Koyoi, he has a [[Genetic sexual attraction|sister complex]], for which he claims the love is purely brotherly.  Like all other guys at his school, he cowers at hearing the name of Misao Zaitsu, and is under the impression that his sister has fallen for Misao. When Misaki shows her interest in him, he is puzzled as why someone such as her would like someone like him. They seem to be a couple at the end. {{anime voices|Hiroyuki Yoshino}}<ref name="staff"/>

;{{nihongo|Misaki Yamamoto|<U+5C71><U+672C><U+5CAC>|Yamamoto Misaki}}
: A first year in high school, Misaki is close friends with Meguru and Yuu, as well as the next door neighbor and childhood friend of the Zaitsu brothers.  She has a very open relationship with her neighbors, and even comes into Mamoru's room through his window, and is the only character in the series who's not afraid of Misao (in fact she often has casual conversations with him). She somehow knows [[Grappling hold#Submission hold|submission techniques]], and can perform them instinctively in her sleep. Though she claimed she had no interest in relationships at the moment, she developed an interest for Yuuji Arihara when he shoved a lollipop in her mouth (showing an example to his friend, Yoshihiko Bessho). But although she likes Yuuji, she is not used to feeling vulnerable around boys, because she's usually cool and level headed. When Yuuji begins to express his interest in her, it makes her shy and unsettled, so she tells Arihara to leave her alone. He later explains that love is about letting people see your other sides as well, not just your tough side. They seem to be dating afterward. It was also revealed that being an only child, she's quite envious at those who have siblings, and thus, as part of her attraction to Yuuji, she also takes a liking to his younger sister Ayumi, treating her as a younger sister of her own. {{anime voices|Rie Tanaka}}<ref name="staff"/>

;{{nihongo|Yuu Enomoto|<U+6C5F><U+30CE><U+672C><U+5915>|Enomoto Yuu}}
: The focus of Chapter 3. Yuu is good friends with Meguru and Misaki, and is also Kei's older sister. She is a cheery girl who never hesitates to make friends.  Although she appears to be a little ditsy, she carries an avid interest for just about everything, making her very knowledgeable on a variety of subjects. As a result, she, like her sister, garners a lot of attention from many guys. However, whether its being oblivious or just nonchalant, she doesn't seem to mind being friendly with all of them. She also seems to be younger than her little sister, because of her small size and child-like innocence. {{anime voices|Satomi Sato}}<ref name="staff"/>

;{{nihongo|Meguru Watase|<U+6E21><U+702C><U+3081><U+3050><U+308B>|Watase Meguru}}
: Meguru is a close friend of both Misaki and Yuu.  In middle school, she was a national champion in swimming, making her a reserve candidate for the Olympics.  However, Meguru quits swimming when she enters high school because her breasts grow too large and attract too much attention when she's in her swimsuit.  Unfortunately, those who are attracted don't include Takei, whom Meguru secretly likes. She also wears small bras in attempt to make her breasts look smaller. Her friends encourage her to to not be ashamed of them, and not hiding them. She eventually joins the school swimming team, at first to save the team from closure (due to the fact that it had only five members and one of them quit) and taking the position as team manager, and, after some prodding from Takei, eventually as one of the swimmers. {{anime voices|Ryoko Shiraishi}}<ref name="staff"/>

;{{nihongo|Uemura|<U+4E0A><U+6751>|Uemura}}
:A classmate of Misaki and Yuu, he has dreamed of being a [[mangaka]] since he was 5 years old.  He decides to use Yuu as the model for a story he is thinking up, and Yuu inadvertently becomes the first one to find out about his passion.  He receives a lot of support from Yuu, and eventually becomes more interested on becoming her boyfriend than writing manga.  Still, he is faced by the challenges he face with manga, as well as the competition for Yuu's attention.

;{{nihongo|Yoshihiko Bessho|<U+5225><U+6240><U+826F><U+5F66>|Bessho Yoshihiko}}
: A first year in high school, Yoshihiko is Koyoi's older brother, with whom she is smitten.  However, he does not return her level of affection, and is often annoyed by it. He is in love with Misaki, whom, to his dismay, likes his friend Arihara, but they are in friendly terms such that she often confides in him about boys. {{anime voices|Satoshi Hino}}<ref name="staff"/>

;{{nihongo|Kazuma Chikura|<U+5343><U+5009><U+4E00><U+771F>|Chikura Kazuma}}
:Nao's older brother, he is classmates with Yoshihiko and Yuuji.  To his dismay, all three of their younger sisters are coincidentally friends.

;{{nihongo|Gengorou Takei|<U+6B66><U+5C45><U+6E90><U+4E94><U+90CE>|Takei Gengorou}}
:Upperclassman who tries to persuade Meguru to join the swimming club at every opportunity.  He challenges Meguru to a backstroke contest (to persuade her to join the team) and loses. Takei is Meguru's childhood friend - it is mentioned that they've taken swimming together since they were children. He finally succeeds in getting Meguru to join the swimming club as a star player after he admits to liking her as a girl rather than merely as a champion swimmer.

; Yukito Renjou
:An artist, whom drew the Sakura painting which Nao is inspired at. He used to attend the middle school which Nao goes to. Presently, he goes to a prestigious high school called Kaitei High School and is in his graduating year. He became close to Nao after she finds out he made the painting she often looked at. Upon his graduation though, he left Japan. He also shares a strong resemblance to Okusa, another character from Kawashita's work, Strawberry 100%.

; Nanoka Kyuuma
:A first year in highschool, and Meguru's self-proclaimed rival in swimming since middle school. She shows up to challenge Meguru to a swimming race and beats her, making Meguru unsure of herself, and is also influenctial in getting Meguru to get back into swimming. Her small stature makes people think she is a primary school student. Meguru calls her Q-chan, a nickname Nanoka hates.
