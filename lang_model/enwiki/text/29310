==Entry and ejection from the Nation of Islam==
In September, 1990, Quanell Evans was inspired by a [[Louis Farrakhan]] speech at [[Sam Houston Coliseum]] and joined the [[Nation of Islam]] against his parents' wishes. The newly dubbed Quanell X quickly became a spokesman in the organization.<ref name="Visionary">{{cite news

In July, 1992, Quanell X found his brother Quinten Evans dead in his apartment with three others, all with bullets to their heads. In August, 2009, three incarcerated men were charged with capital murder in the killings.<ref name="Closure">{{cite news

In 1995, Quanell X was quoted in the ''[[New York Daily News]]'' as saying, <blockquote>
"I say to Jewish America: Get ready <U+2026> knuckle up, put your boots on, because we're ready and the war is going down. <U+2026> The real deal is this: Black youth do not want a relationship with the Jewish community or the mainstream white community or the foot shuffling, head-bowing, knee bobbing black community. <U+2026> All you Jews can go straight to hell."<ref name="New York Daily News">{{cite news | title=Quanell X statement, October 17, 1995 | publisher= New York Daily News | date=October 17, 1995}}</ref></blockquote>

Quanell X was forced out of the Nation of Islam for publicly inciting violence with his televised, and highly publicized, exhortation to Houston-area blacks: <blockquote>
"[i]f you feel that you just got to mug somebody because of your hurt and your pain, go to River Oaks and mug you some good white folks. If you<U+2019>re angry that our brother is put to death, don<U+2019>t burn down your own community, give these white folks hell from the womb to the tomb."<ref>{{cite news

After leaving the Nation of Islam, Quanell X joined a [[paramilitary]] group named "MFOI", for "Mental Freedom Obtains Independence." The new faction was not designed to attract significant exoteric membership.<ref name = "Paramilitary">

==Community activist==
Since becoming a leader of the New Black Panthers, Quanell X has made himself and his views heard through public demonstrations and assistance with the surrender of outstanding suspects to law enforcement agencies.  
In 1999, at the trial of [[John_King_(murderer)|John William King]] for the 1998 slaying of [[James Byrd, Jr.]], Quanell X and his entourage briefly disrupted proceedings.<ref name="Nightmare">{{cite news

[[Jeffrey Battle]] served as a bodyguard for Quanell X in Houston during the late 1990s.  Battle was notable as one of the [[Portland Seven]], a group of [[American Muslim]]s who tried to aid the [[Taliban]] in [[Afghanistan]] following the events of [[September 11, 2001]].  In October 2002 Quanell X traveled to [[Portland, Oregon]], to attend a court hearing for [[October Lewis]], Battle's ex-wife.  Lewis was released at the hearing.  Battle was convicted of sedition, and is currently serving an 18-year prison sentence.<ref = "Battle">{{cite news

On March 30, 2004 Quanell X took the podium at a Houston City Council meeting and demanded that [[reparations for slavery]] be put on the council agenda. This demand had previously been denied by mayor [[Bill White (politician)|Bill White]]. The exchange escalated enough that Houston police were called to remove Quanell forcibly from the chamber.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.houstontx.gov/citysec/agendas/2004/20040330.pdf|title=City Council Chamber, City Hall, Tuesday, March 30, 2004|publisher=houstontx.gov|accessdate=2009-05-14}}</ref>

In June 2004 Quanell X was charged with evading arrest. He was on the phone with a [[Houston Police Department]] assistant police chief ([[Charles R.

He was instrumental in having a murder suspect, [[Randy Sylvester Sr.]], reveal the locations of his missing children.  After initially giving Sylvester the benefit of the doubt, he was convinced otherwise when he went with Pasadena police and Sylvester to an apartment he maintained separately from his family's that he called his "dog house." There, Sylvester engaged in drugs and pornography. Quanell X would not go into detail, but other things he learned in that apartment changed his mind about Sylvester.  He convinced the suspect to "Do the right thing" and lead Quanell X and police to a location just outside of [[Pasadena, Texas]] in Houston, where the charred remains were located.<ref>

In March 2011 Quanell X traveled to [[Cleveland, Texas]] to support 18 men allegedly involved in the gang rape of an 11 year old girl. Quannel X spoke out against the victim claiming she did not do enough to prevent herself from being gang raped. He later went on to claim the girl's parents were also responsible for her assault. 
<blockquote>"It was not the young girl that yelled rape. Stop right there -- something is wrong, brothers and sisters", "Where was the mother? Where was the father?" </blockquote><ref>[http://www.cnn.com/2011/CRIME/03/14/texas.alleged.rape/index.html Alleged gang rape of girl, 11, ignites firestorm in Texas community]</ref>

==Joe Horn protest==
{{main|Joe Horn shooting controversy}}

Quanell X led a rally in front of the [[Pasadena, Texas]], home of Joe Horn on December 2, 2007.  Horn had shot and killed two men - Hernando Riascos Torres (aka Miguel Antonio DeJesus) and Diego Ortiz, illegal aliens and members of a burglary and fake ID ring from [[Colombia]].  The pair had broken into a neighbor's house. Horn, against repeated requests of the 911 operator not to confront the burglars, exited his home to confront them. On the 911 tapes Horn exclaims, "Move, and you're dead", followed by three shotgun blasts.<ref name = "Review">

Quanell X, who thought the shootings may have been racially motivated, approached Horn's house to speak to the media. He was overwhelmed by several hundred counter-protesters protecting Horn from Quanell X's accusations.  The crowd of counter-protesters included bikers revving their motorcycles, many of them chanting, "USA," "Go home," and "We love our country; what do you love?" while waving placards, Texas flags, and US flags.  Quanell X could not be heard over the noise, even when using a [[Megaphone|bullhorn]], and left the area about eight minutes later.  He returned soon after with more supporters and attempted to speak again, but the counter-protests continued. [[Riot control|Riot police]] were readied in case of violence between the two groups. Quanell X believed that because Horn was white and not black, he was not prosecuted (even though at the time the District Attorney had not made a ruling).  On June 25, 2008 the case was sent to a [[grand jury]] to decide whether or not Horn should go to trial. The grand jury relocated due to death threats, Quanell X did not take responsibility for them. On June 30, 2008 Horn was cleared by a [[Harris County, Texas|Harris County]] Grand Jury in the deaths of Ortiz and Diego after two weeks of testimony.<ref name = "Protest">

== Apologies ==

On January 28, 2008, after taking a tour of the [[Holocaust Museum Houston]], Quanell said he became enlightened and apologized for his past statements on [[Jews]].
<blockquote>"I seek the forgiveness of every survivor who has heard the words I've said. I did not say them in the proper manner to make the point I was trying to get across. I can see and understand how they might be utterly paranoid (of) a person such as myself."</blockquote>
He has been challenging those within the community who sympathize with [[Osama bin Laden]].<ref>Tolson, Mike and Dale Lezon.
