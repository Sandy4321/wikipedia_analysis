==Career==  

He began his career as an [[investment analyst]] in 1986. From 1988 to 1990 he was a research fellow in economics at the [[University of Kent]] in Canterbury where he worked on the development of [[econometric models]] to forecast the demand for the Channel Tunnel and other infrastructure.  He has taught at the [[University of Botswana]] and the [[University of Namibia]]. <ref name="bankofengland" /> He has also served as an advisor to a number of central banks, government ministries, the [[World Bank]] and the [[United Nations Economic Commission for Africa]]. <ref>Development of an Unlisted Securities Market Policy <U+2013> A Report to the Financial Services Industry of Namibia, 2007, Charles Okeahalam, (http://www.gipf.com.na/documents/755_unlisted_securities_market.pdf)</ref> <ref>South Africa National Council of Provinces Meeting, 2003, (http://www.parliament.gov.za/live/commonrepository/Processed/20091112/90600_1.doc)</ref> <ref>The Banking Sector in Southern Africa: A Test of the Structure-Performance Hypothesis, Charles Okeahalam, International Journal of Management and Decision Making, 5, 216-245.

In 1998 he wrote a report that evaluated the bank and non-bank prudential regulatory framework of Namibia, which led to the establishment of the Namibia Financial Institutions Supervisory Authority <ref>Namibia Financial Institutions Supervisory Authority (http://www.namfisa.com.na)</ref> in 2001.  In South Africa, he has served as key economic advisor to the ANC-led government on a number of initiatives.

In 2000 he served as the advisor to the Competition Commission on the attempted takeover of [[Standard Bank]] by [[Nedbank]].   He is an early proponent of the view that the most important economic variable for growth in Africa is the supply of basic infrastructure and that this should be the primary focus of African development finance institutions. In 2004 he led a team which wrote a major report that called for the restructuring of the [[African Development Bank]] to enable it to focus on the financing of transnational road, rail, and electricity infrastructure networks in Africa.
