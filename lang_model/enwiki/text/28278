'''Winnie-the-Pooh''', commonly shortened to '''Pooh Bear''' or simply '''Pooh''', and once referred to as '''Edward Bear''', is a fictional [[bear]] created by [[A. A. Milne]]. The first collection of stories about the character was the book ''[[Winnie-the-Pooh (book)|Winnie-the-Pooh]]'' (1926), and this was followed by ''[[The House at Pooh Corner]]'' (1928). Milne also included a poem about the bear in the children<U+2019>s verse book ''[[When We Were Very Young]]'' (1924)  and many more in ''[[Now We Are Six]]'' (1927). All four volumes were [[illustrator|illustrated]] by [[E. H. Shepard]].

The hyphens in the character's name were later dropped when [[The Walt Disney Company]] adapted the Pooh stories into a series of Winnie the Pooh featurettes that became one of the company's most successful franchises worldwide: see [[Winnie the Pooh (Disney)]].

The Pooh stories have been translated into many languages, notably including [[Alexander Lenard]]'s [[Latin]] translation, ''Winnie ille Pu'', which was first published in 1958, and, in 1960, became the only Latin book ever to have been featured on the [[New York Times Best Seller List]].<ref>McDowell, Edwin. [http://www.nytimes.com/1984/11/18/books/winnie-ille-pu-nearly-xxv-years-later.html "Winnie Ille Pu Nearly XXV Years Later"], ''New York Times'' (18 November 1984). Retrieved 2 January 2010.</ref>

== History ==
=== Origin ===

[[File:The original Winnie the Pooh toys.jpg|thumb|left|Original Winnie the Pooh stuffed toys. Clockwise from bottom left: [[Tigger]], [[Kanga (Winnie-the-Pooh)|Kanga]], Edward Bear ("Winnie the Pooh"), [[Eeyore]], and [[Piglet (Winnie the Pooh)|Piglet]].  [[Roo]] was lost long ago; the other characters were made up for the stories.]]
Milne named the character Winnie-the-Pooh after a [[teddy bear]] owned by his son, [[Christopher Robin Milne]], who was the basis for the character [[Christopher Robin]]. His toys also lent their names to most of the other characters, except for [[Owl (Winnie the Pooh)|Owl]] and [[Rabbit (Winnie the Pooh)|Rabbit]], as well as the [[Gopher (Winnie the Pooh)|Gopher]] character, who was added in the Disney version. Christopher Robin's toy bear is now on display at the [[New York Public Library Main Branch|Main Branch of the New York Public Library]] in [[New York, New York|New York]].<ref>[http://www.nypl.org/branch/central/dlc/dch/pooh/ "The Adventures of the Real Winnie-the-Pooh.] The New York Public Library.</ref>

[[File:Harry Colebourne and Winnie.jpg|thumb|upright|Harry Colebourne and Winnie 1914]]
Christopher Milne had named his toy bear after [[Winnipeg bear|Winnie]], an [[American black bear]] which he often saw at [[London Zoo]], and "Pooh", a swan they had met while on holiday. The bear cub was purchased from a hunter for $20 by Canadian Lieutenant [[Harry Colebourn]] in [[White River, Ontario]], [[Canada]], while en route to England during the First World War. He named the bear "Winnie" after his hometown in [[Winnipeg]], Manitoba. "Winnie" was surreptitiously brought to England with her owner, and gained unofficial recognition as [[The Fort Garry Horse]] regimental mascot. Colebourne left Winnie at the London Zoo while he and his unit were in France; after the war she was officially donated to the zoo, as she had become a much loved attraction there.<ref>[http://www.histori.ca/minutes/minute.do?id=10193 "Winnie".] ''Historica Minutes'', The Historica Foundation of Canada. Retrieved on 2008-05-30.</ref> Pooh the swan appears as a character in its own right in ''[[When We Were Very Young]]''.

In the first chapter of ''[[Winnie-the-Pooh (book)|Winnie-the-Pooh]]'', Milne offers this explanation of why Winnie-the-Pooh is often called simply "Pooh":
:"But his arms were so stiff ... they stayed up straight in the air for more than a week, and whenever a fly came and settled on his nose he had to blow it off. And I think <U+2014> but I am not sure <U+2014> that <em>that</em> is why he is always called Pooh."
This explanation would be more believable, of course, if Christopher Robin had not already called him "Pooh" earlier in the story.

=== Ashdown Forest: the setting for the stories ===
The Winnie-the-Pooh stories are set in [[Ashdown Forest]], [[Sussex]], [[England]]. The forest is a large area of tranquil open heathland on the highest sandy ridges of the [[High Weald AONB|High Weald Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty]] situated 30 miles (50 km) south of London. In 1925 Milne, a Londoner, bought a country home a mile to the north of the forest at Cotchford Farm, near [[Hartfield]]. According to Christopher Milne, while his father continued to live in London "...the four of us&mdash;he, his wife, his son and his son's nanny&mdash;would pile into a large blue, chauffeur-driven Fiat and travel down every Saturday morning and back again every Monday afternoon. And we would spend a whole glorious month there in the spring and two months in the summer."
<ref>{{cite book|last =Willard|first =Barbara|authorlink =Barbara Willard| coauthors =| title =The Forest - Ashdown in East Sussex | publisher =Sweethaws Press|date=1989|location =Sussex| pages =| url =| doi =| id = | isbn = }} introduction pp. xi-xii</ref> From the front lawn the family had a view across a meadow to a line of alders that fringed the [[River Medway]], beyond which the ground rose through more trees until finally "above them, in the faraway distance, crowning the view, was a bare hilltop. In the centre of this hilltop was a clump of pines." Most of his father's visits to the forest at this time were, he noted, family expeditions on foot "to make yet another attempt to count the pine trees on Gill's Lap or to search for the marsh gentian". Christopher added that, inspired by Ashdown Forest, his father had made it "the setting for two of his books, finishing the second little over three years after his arrival".

Many locations in the stories can be linked to real places in and around the forest. As Christopher Milne wrote in his autobiography: <U+201C>Pooh<U+2019>s forest and Ashdown Forest are identical<U+201D>. For example, the fictional "[[Hundred Acre Wood]]" was in reality Five Hundred Acre Wood; Galleon's Leap was inspired by the prominent hilltop of Gill's Lap, while a clump of trees just north of Gill's Lap became Christopher Robin's ''The Enchanted Place'' because no-one had ever been able to count whether there were sixty-three or sixty-four trees in the circle.<ref>{{cite web

The landscapes depicted in [[EH_Shepard|E.H. Shepard<U+2019>s]] illustrations for the Winnie-the-Pooh books are directly inspired by the distinctive landscape of Ashdown Forest, with its high, open heathlands of heather, gorse, bracken and silver birch punctuated by hilltop clumps of pine trees. In many cases Shepard's illustrations can be matched to actual views, allowing for a degree of artistic licence. Shepard's sketches of pine trees and other forest scenes are on display at the [[Victoria and Albert Museum|V&A Museum]] in London.

The game of [[Poohsticks]] was originally played by Christopher Milne on a footbridge across a tributary of the River Medway in Posingford Wood, close to Cotchford Farm. It is traditional to play the game there using sticks gathered in nearby woodland. When the footbridge required replacement in recent times the engineer designed a new structure based closely on the drawings by E. H. Shepard of the bridge in the original books, as the bridge did not originally appear as the artist drew it. An information board at the bridge describes how to play the game.

=== First publication ===

[[Image:WP Evening News.jpg|right|thumb|Winnie-the-Pooh's d<U+00E9>but in the Dec. 24, 1925 London Evening News]]There are three claimants, depending on the precise question posed. Christopher Robin's teddy bear, Edward, made his character d<U+00E9>but in a poem in Milne's book of children's verse ''[[When We Were Very Young]]'' (1924). Winnie-the-Pooh first appeared by name on 24 December 1925, in a Christmas story commissioned and published by the London newspaper ''[[Evening News (London)|The Evening News]]''. It was illustrated by J. H. Dowd.<ref>{{Citation

The book was published in October 1926 by the publisher of Milne's earlier children's work, [[Methuen Publishing|Methuen]], in England, and [[E. P. Dutton]] in the United States.<ref>{{cite book

===Sequel===
An authorised sequel ''[[Return to the Hundred Acre Wood]]'' was published on 5 October 2009. The author, [[David Benedictus]], has developed, but not changed, Milne's characterisations. The illustrations, by Mark Burgess, are in the style of Shepard.<ref>{{cite news|title=Sequel brings Pooh friends old and new|last=Kennedy|first=Maev|authorlink=Maev Kennedy|date=5 October 2009|work=[[The Guardian]]|pages=15|accessdate=2009-10-05}}</ref>

=== Stephen Slesinger ===
On January 6, 1930, [[Stephen Slesinger]] purchased U.S. and Canadian merchandising, television, recording and other trade rights to the "Winnie-the-Pooh" works from Milne for a $1000 advance and 66% of Slesinger's income, creating the modern licensing industry. By November 1931, Pooh was a $50 million-a-year business.<ref>{{Citation| title = The Merchant of Child| newspaper = Fortune| pages = 71| year = 1931| date = Nov. 1931}}</ref> Slesinger marketed Pooh and his friends for more than 30 years, creating the first Pooh doll, record, board game, puzzle, US radio broadcast (NBC), animation, and motion picture film.<ref>{{Citation| last = McElway| first = St. Claire| title = The Literary Character in Business & Commerce| newspaper = The New Yorker| year = 1936| date = 26 Oct. 1936}}</ref> In 1961, Disney acquired rights from Slesinger to produce articles of merchandise based on characters from its feature animation.

=== Red Shirt Pooh ===

The first time Pooh and his friends appeared in colour was 1932, when he was drawn by Slesinger in his now-familiar red shirt and featured on an [[RCA Victor]] picture record. [[Parker Brothers]] also introduced ''A. A. Milne's Winnie-the-Pooh Game'' in 1933, again with Pooh in his red shirt. In the 1940s, Agnes Brush created the first plush dolls with Pooh in his red shirt. It is important to note that E.H Shepard had drawn Pooh with a shirt as early as the first Winnie-The-Pooh book, which was subsequently coloured red in later coloured editions.

=== Disney ===

<!-- Image with inadequate rationale removed: [[File:TheNewAdventuresofWinniethePooh.jpg|thumb|left|The title card of [[The New Adventures of Winnie the Pooh]] ]] -->

After Slesinger's death in 1953, his wife, [[Shirley Slesinger Lasswell]], continued developing the character herself. In 1961, she licensed rights to [[The Walt Disney Company|Walt Disney Productions]] in exchange for royalties in the first of two agreements between Stephen Slesinger, Inc. and Disney.<ref>[http://jcgi.pathfinder.com/fortune/print/0,15935,404206,00.html "The Curse of Pooh."] ''Fortune''. </ref> The same year, Daphne Milne also licensed certain rights, including motion picture rights, to Disney.

Since 1966, Disney has released numerous animated productions starring Winnie the Pooh and related characters. These have included  theatrical  [[featurette]]s, television series, and [[direct-to-video]] films, as well as the theatrical feature-length films ''[[The Tigger Movie]]'', ''[[Piglet's Big Movie]]'', and ''[[Pooh's Heffalump Movie]]''.

In December 2005, Disney announced a [[Disney Channel]] [[animated television series]], ''[[My Friends Tigger & Pooh]]'', focusing on adventures had by 6-year-old Darby and the Pooh characters, with the occasional appearance from [[Christopher Robin]].<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/4512770.stm "New-look Pooh 'has girl friend'."] BBC News.</ref> The show began airing on the Disney Channel on May 12, 2007.

The Disney version of Winnie the Pooh was featured in [[Cartoon All-Stars to the Rescue]], the [[Kingdom Hearts]] videogames and the TV series [[House of Mouse]]

Pooh also appears at [[Walt Disney Parks and Resorts]] as a meet-able and child friendly character.

=== Merchandising revenue dispute ===
[[File:Fifi i cvjetno drustvo 280309.jpg|thumb|right|150px|'''Winnie Pooh''' with [[Fifi & the Flowertots|Stingo from Fifi & the Flowertots]] in Zagreb, Croatia]]
Pooh videos, [[teddy bear]]s, and other merchandise generate substantial annual revenues for Disney. The size of Pooh stuffed toys ranges from [[beanie babies|Beanie]] and miniature to human-sized. In addition to the stylized Disney Pooh, Disney markets Classic Pooh merchandise which more closely resembles E.H. Shepard<U+2019>s illustrations. It is estimated that Winnie the Pooh features and merchandise generate as much revenue as [[Mickey Mouse]], [[Minnie Mouse]], [[Donald Duck]], [[Goofy]], and [[Pluto (dog)|Pluto]] combined.<ref>[http://jcgi.pathfinder.com/fortune/print/0,15935,404206,00.html "The Curse of Pooh"] ''Fortune''.</ref>

In 1991, Stephen Slesinger, Inc. filed a lawsuit against Disney which alleged that Disney had breached their 1983 agreement by again failing to accurately report revenue from Winnie the Pooh sales. Under this agreement, Disney was to retain approximately 98% of gross worldwide revenues while the remaining 2% was to be paid to Slesinger. In addition, the suit alleged that Disney had failed to pay required royalties on all commercial exploitation of the product name.<ref>[http://www.monitor.net/monitor/0201a/pooh1.html "The Pooh Files"] ''The Albion Monitor''.</ref> Though the Disney corporation was sanctioned by a judge for destroying forty boxes of evidential documents,<ref name=vjnelson>{{cite web

On 19 February 2007 Disney lost a court case in Los Angeles which ruled their "misguided claims" to dispute the licensing agreements with Slesinger, Inc. were unjustified,<ref>{{cite news

* Not everyone was a fan of the original stories. [[Dorothy Parker]] in particular was critical of what she considered [[A. A. Milne]]'s "dumbing down of English for children", a criticism she had for many other children's book authors as well. In her pseudonym as [[Constant Reader]] in the [[The New Yorker|New Yorker]] magazine she made one of her most famous barbs when she, while reviewing one of the stories, wrote, "and it is precisely at that word, 'hunny' that Tonstant Weader fwowed up."
* [[Kenny Loggins]] wrote the song "[[House at Pooh Corner (song)|House at Pooh Corner]]", which was originally recorded by the [[Nitty Gritty Dirt Band]]<ref>[http://www.songfacts.com/detail.php?id=8486 House at Pooh Corner by Loggins and Messina Songfacts]</ref>. Loggins later rewrote the song as "[[Return to Pooh Corner]]", featuring on the album of the same name in 1991.
