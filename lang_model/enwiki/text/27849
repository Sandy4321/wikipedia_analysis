'''Quilapay<U+00FA>n''' ({{IPA-es|kilapa<U+02C8><U+029D>un}}) are an [[instrumental]] and vocal [[folk music]] group from [[Chile]] and among the longest lasting and most influential exponents of the ''[[Nueva Canci<U+00F3>n]] Chilena'' (New Song) movement. Formed in Chile during the mid-1960s, the group became inseparable with the revolution that occurred in the popular music of the country under the [[Popular Unity]] Government of [[Salvador Allende]]. Since its formation and during its forty year long history - both in Chile and during its lengthy period of exile in France - the group has seen modifications to its personnel lineup, to the subject and content of its work, and controversy regarding irreconciliable differences with the current and former group director; which has led each to maintain a distinctive - yet equally impressive - Quilapay<U+00FA>n ensemble: one in Chile (named: Quilapay<U+00FA>n-Hist<U+00F3>rico) and one in France (named: Quilapay<U+00FA>n-France).

==History==

Quilapay<U+00FA>n originated in 1965 when [[Julio Numhauser]], and the brothers Julio and [[Eduardo Carrasco]] formed a folk music trio which they simply called "the three bearded men" (viz. ''Quila-Pay<U+00FA>n'') in the [[Mapuche]] language (viz. [[Mapudungun]] <U+2013> the language of the people native to the region that is now the south of [[Chile]], the [[Araucanians]]). Their first public performances were at the [[Universidad de Chile]] in [[Valpara<U+00ED>so]] organized by their first musical director, [[<U+00C1>ngel Parra]] (The son of [[Violeta Parra]]). In 1966 Patricio Castillo joined the group and they began performing and winning notoriety for their [[Andean music]] as well as their black [[ponchos]] which became the group's trademark. During this time they won their first prize, ''La Guitarra de Oro'' (The Golden Guitar) in the ''Primer Festival Nacional del Folkore "Chile M<U+00FA>ltiple".'' (First National Festival of Folklore), they also made their first recording, appearing in one song of [[<U+00C1>ngel Parra]], "El Pueblo" ("The People").

In one of these performances of 1966 in Valpara<U+00ED>so the group met with [[V<U+00ED>ctor Jara]] with whom the group maintained a close and productive artistic association with for many years. At the request of the group, V<U+00ED>ctor Jara becomes Quilapay<U+00FA>n's musical director and he worked on the groups discipline, their stage performances and the style and content of the groups music and songs. Jara presents them to the record label [[Odeon Records]], where they would record 5 LPs. Their first album, ''[[Quilapay<U+00FA>n (Album)|Quilapay<U+00FA>n]]'' was basically an [[Andean music]] album but they included songs of [[<U+00C1>ngel Parra]], V<U+00ED>ctor Jara and new compositions of [[Eduardo Carrasco]] such as "La Paloma2 and "El canto del [[White-winged Dove|cuculi]]".

''This surpassing is called revolution and its motor and fundamental agent is the [[working class]]. Our group, loyal to the ideals of [[Luis Emilio Recabarren]], sees its work as a continuation of what has already been achieved by many other popular/folk artists. 
<p>
''This side of the trenches has been occupied by artists whose names are forever linked to the revolutionary struggle of our people: the first [[Luis Emilio Recabarren]], the latest: [[Violeta Parra]] and [[Pablo Neruda]]. The example they have given us is the light that guides us.''<p style="text-align: right;"> <U+2014> Quilapay<U+00FA>n (1969)<ref> Part of a statement that appeared on the Italian edition of Quilapay<U+00FA>n's album ''[[Basta (album)|Basta]]'' in 1974 - that was originally released in Chile in 1969.</ref></blockquote>

In 1967 they recorded an album together with V<U+00ED>ctor Jara, ''[[Canciones folkl<U+00F3>ricas de Am<U+00E9>rica]]'' (''Folk Songs of America''). During this time Julio Numhauser left the group over discrepancies on the style of music the group was pursuing and was replaced by [[Guillermo "Willy" Odd<U+00F3>]]. During 1967 they also toured the USSR, Italy, France and other parts of Europe and recorded an LP with the Chilean painter and poet Juan Capra. 

In 1968, Quilapay<U+00FA>n participated in the launch of a new record label of ''La Jota'' ([[Communist Party of Chile|Chile's Communist Party]] Youth Organization) and here they record their LP ''[[X Vietnam]]'' which included songs from the [[Spanish Revolution]]; to the surprise of many commercial record labels its release became a nationwide success. This album established the group's thematic and aesthetics and created great interest and a following among progressive youth. From the success of this album the label DICAP (Discoteca del Cantar Popular) appeared, which became the springboard of the ''Nueva Canci<U+00F3>n Chilena'' (New Chilean Song) movement. The DICAP label would record up to 60 musical productions until the [[1973 Chilean coup d'<U+00E9>tat|military coup of September 11, 1973]], which banned and literally destroyed the record label. During 1968 Julio Carrasco left the group for political differences, and was replaced by Hern<U+00E1>n Gomez. A that time they performed at different university places and made their first two hours show, during two days in Santiago getting a tremendous success.  

In 1969 they recorded the <U+2018>[[Basta (album)|Basta]]<U+2019> LP, which included an eclectic and highly political collection of songs from different parts of the world, establishing the fundamental element of the New Chilean Song: its [[Proletarian internationalism|Internationalism]]. This album was released with a lengthy statement made by the group about the nature of their work and their commitment to the socialist cause.Rodolfo Parada joint the group.

In 1969 they also appeared supporting V<U+00ED>ctor Jara in his album, ''[[Pongo en tus manos abiertas]]'' (''Into your open hands'') in songs such as "A [[Cochabamba]] Me Voy", "El Martillo" and "Movil Oil Special". They also joined Jara at the ''Primer Festival de la Nueva Cancion Chilena'' (First Festival of the New Chilean Song) where they jointly interpreted <U+2018>Plegaria a un Labrador<U+2019> (Prayer to a Laborer) which ultimately won the festivals award. After three years V<U+00ED>ctor Jara and Quilapay<U+00FA>n assumed different paths and [[Eduardo Carrasco]] became the group's director. 

They were forced into exile in France after the right-wing military coup of 1973. The group settled in the city of Colombes, France for more than a decade. Their major works include [[Santa Mar<U+00ED>a de Iquique]] (1970), an album of spoken history, songs, and instrumentals about a notorious massacre in the city of [[Iquique]], and the song "[[El pueblo unido jam<U+00E1>s ser<U+00E1> vencido]]" ("The people, united, will never be defeated"), written by famed Chilean songwriter and playwright [[Sergio Ortega]].

==The group splits into two factions==
Both Quilapay<U+00FA>n and [[Inti-Illimani]]'s recent paths have been marked by internal issues. Over the years historic members left the groups and others took their place. In the case of Quilapay<U+00FA>n, formed by the ancienst Carlos Quezada, Hernan Gomez, Rodolfo Parada, Hugo lagos, Guillermo Garcia and Ricardo Venegas joined by Patricio Wang continues to operate out of France, and has released two albums since 1989. Parada registered the mark "Quilapayun" whithout others members authorisations. Because of this and other non regular attitudes the historic members refuse to continue with Parada and Wang,so Quilapayun splits into two.The remaining original members of the group reunited in 2003 forming the "historic" Quilapay<U+00FA>n have released two new albums and two live dvd since 2004. There continues to be pending litigation in the French courts regarding this issue, as both groups are claiming the name and legacy of Quilapay<U+00FA>n. The Chile-based historic faction is celebrating the group's 40 year anniversary performing concerts in Chile, Latin America and Europe in coordination with the "historic" Inti-Illimani. The joint concerts have been advertised and promoted as [[Inti+Quila]]. The current "historic" lineup includes Eduardo Carrasco, Rub<U+00E9>n Escudero, Ricardo Venegas, Guillermo Garc<U+00ED>a, Ismael Odd<U+00F3> (son of [[Guillermo "Willy" Odd<U+00F3>]]), Hugo Lagos, Hern<U+00E1>n G<U+00F3>mez, Carlos Quezada and Sebasti<U+00E1>n Quezada (son of Carlos).

The 5th of december 2007 the Court of Appeal of Paris forbid Parada and Wang<U+2019>s groupe <U+00AB> <U+2026> from making use of the name QUILAPAYUN, subject to a fine of 10 000 per infringement<U+2026> <U+00BB>.
this judgement has been confirmed by the Highest Court of Appeal (Cour de Cassation de Paris) on the 11th june 2009.
