==Plot==
[[Springfield (The Simpsons)|Springfield]] is "in the grip of lottery fever" with a $130 million jackpot and, as a result, no one in the [[Simpson family]] notices that their pet dog, [[Santa's Little Helper]], has become seriously ill. Once the dog is discovered to be sick, the family rushes him to the hospital where they learn that he needs a US$750 emergency operation of [[bloat]]. [[Homer Simpson|Homer]] is saddened to tell his children, [[Bart Simpson|Bart]] and [[Lisa Simpson|Lisa]], that the family simply cannot afford the operation. However, after seeing how much everyone loves the dog, especially Bart, he decides to find a way to pay for it.

In order to afford the operation, everyone in the family has to make sacrifices in their every day life, such as  Homer having to give up on buying beer and [[Marge Simpson|Marge]] having to cook with lower-quality food and forgo her weekly lottery ticket. They eventually save up enough money for the operation, which becomes a success. The family is joyous that their dog is well again, but soon begins to feel the strain of their sacrifices. As a result, the family members take out their resentment on the dog. Feeling unloved, Santa's Little Helper runs away from home and goes off on an adventure, only to be captured, taken to the pound, and adopted by [[Mr. Burns]], who trains him to become one of his vicious attack hounds. After a long brainwashing process, consisting of the [[Ludovico technique]], Santa's Little Helper is turned into a bloodthirsty killer.

The family begins to regret all the nasty things they said about their dog, and Bart decides to get him back. Bart goes from home to home asking if anyone has seen his dog. When he arrives at Burns' mansion, Santa's Little Helper, along with other vicious dogs, tries to attack him. However, when remembering all the good times they had, Santa's Little Helper snaps out of his brainwashed state. After that, the other vicious dogs try to attack Bart, but Santa's Little Helper growls at them and they run away. The dog then returns to the Simpson family, who begins to love him again.

"Dog of Death" also parodies lottery advertisements. In one commercial featured in the episode, an announcement states: "The state lottery, where everybody wins," while a tiny disclaimer at the bottom of the screen can be seen saying: "Actual odds of winning, one in 380,000,000."<ref>{{cite news|title=The pitch - No 7: National Lottery|last=Clarke|first=Mel|date=October 29, 2000 |work=[[The Sunday Times]]|page=Eire Culture 28|accessdate=2009-09-20}}</ref> During the peak of the lottery fever in Springfield, news anchor Kent Brockman announces on television that people hoping to get tips on how to win the jackpot have borrowed every available copy of [[Shirley Jackson]]'s book ''[[The Lottery]]'' at the local library. One of them is Homer, who throws the book into the fireplace after Kent reveals that "Of course, the book does not contain any hints on how to win the lottery. It is, rather, a chilling tale of conformity gone mad."<ref name="Jackson">{{cite book|last=M.

The fact that Springfield's citizenry also miss the point of Jackson's story completely [...] can perhaps be seen as an indication of a more general misrepresentation of Jackson and her work."<ref name="Jackson"/>

The episode contains several references to previous episodes of ''The Simpsons''. For instance, Santa's Little Helper gets picked up by a car on a street called "Michael Jackson Expressway", a reference to the season three premiere episode "[[Stark Raving Dad]]" that [[Michael Jackson]] guest-starred in.<ref name="Groening"/> In another scene, [[Ned Flanders]] is seen wearing his "Assassin" [[running shoes]] from the season two episode "[[Bart's Dog Gets an F]]".<ref name="book">{{cite book|last=Richmond |first=Ray|coauthors=Antonia Coffman|title=[[The Simpsons: A Complete Guide to Our Favorite Family]] |year=1997 |publisher=Harper Collins Publishers|isbn=0-00063-8898-1|page=84}}</ref> The flyer Homer replaces with the "lost pet" notice is [[Principal Skinner]]'s "Have you seen my body?" flyer from "[[Bart the Murderer]]".<ref name="Jean"/><ref name="book"/>
<!-- Lisa references [[Richard Nixon|Nixon]]'s dog [[Checkers speech|Checkers]]. In addition, the [[veterinarian]] is a reference to [[Vince Edwards]], who played [[Ben Casey]] on the 1960s drama of the same name. Also, among the books that end up in the Simpsons' fireplace are ''[[The Lottery]]'' by [[Shirley Jackson]], ''[[Fahrenheit 451]]'' by [[Ray Bradbury]], ''[[Fatherhood (book)|Fatherhood]]'' by [[Bill Cosby]], and a book entitled "Canine Surgery". ''Fatherhood'' was heavily referenced in the episode ''[[Saturdays of Thunder]]'' earlier this season. The scene in which Mr. Burns and Smithers brainwash Santa's Little Helper is a parody of [[Stanley Kubrick]]'s 1971 film ''[[A Clockwork Orange (film)|A Clockwork Orange]]'' with [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]]'s "[[Ode to Joy]]". The film uses footage of a kind that would aggravate a dog: a dog being hit with a rolled-up newspaper, a shoe kicking a water dish, a kitten playing with a ball of string, a tank running over a doghouse, a dog being hit on the head by a falling toilet seat, and finally "footage" of [[Lyndon Johnson]] holding his dog up in the air by the ears, which actually occurred.<ref>http://www.strangecelebrities.com/images/content/139356.jpg</ref>  Music from ''[[Peter and the Wolf]]'', a children's story composed by [[Sergei Prokofiev]], is played over the wanderings of Santa's Little Helper through Springfield's outer domains. This episode also references several controversies about [[Michael Jackson]]; for example, Kent Brockman's butler tells Kent that his pet [[llama]] bit [[Ted Kennedy]], and Mr. Burns is sleeping in an iron lung as part of his longevity treatment.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20097603,00.html|title=Simian Star of a New Toy Line, Michael Jackson's Pet, Bubbles, Plays Second Banana to No One|date=November 16, 1987|publisher=People Magazine|accessdate=2009-08-24}}</ref> This episode shows the first time where someone other than Homer says "Doh!".

The episode's reference to ''A Clockwork Orange'' was named the tenth greatest film reference in the history of the show by ''[[Total Film]]''{{'}}s Nathan Ditum.<ref name="totalfilm">{{cite news|url=http://www.totalfilm.com/features/the-50-greatest-simpsons-movie-references/page:18|title=The 50 Greatest Simpsons Movie References|last=Ditum|first=Nathan|date=June 6, 2009 |work=[[Total Film]]|accessdate=2009-07-22}}</ref> Nate Meyers of Digitally Obsessed gave "Dog of Death" a 3/5 rating and commented that people who like dogs will enjoy the episode, in part because of Mr. Burns' attack dog training program, which Meyers called a "brilliant reference to ''A Clockwork Orange''." He added that the episode is unlikely to satisfy devoted fans, and the relationship between the family and Santa's Little Helper will not "register" to casual viewers; "Still, there are enough laughs (especially in the animal hospital) to keep the audience entertained."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.digitallyobsessed.com/displaylegacy.php?ID=6129|title=The Simpsons: The Complete Third Season|last=Meyers|first=Nate|date=June 23, 2004|publisher=Digitally Obsessed|accessdate=2009-06-06}}</ref> DVD Movie Guide's Colin Jacobson also praised the parody of ''A Clockwork Orange'', describing it as "possibly the funniest ''Clockwork Orange'' parody I've ever seen." Jacobson added that the episode as a whole offers "a terrific program. [...] From the cracks about the lottery and public hysteria that open the program to the calamities that befall the family when Santa's Little Helper gets sick to the bizarre escapades that greet the pooch when he splits, 'Dog of Death' provides a hilarious piece."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://dvdmg.com/simpsonsseasonthree.shtml|title=The Simpsons: The Complete Third Season (1991) |last=Jacobson|first=Colin|date=August 21, 2003|publisher=DVD Movie Guide|accessdate=2009-06-06}}</ref>

The authors of the book ''I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide'', Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, praised several scenes from the episode, including Homer's dream of winning the lottery, Mr. Burns' brainwashing of Santa's Little Helper, and the closing line of the episode that "No dogs were harmed in the filming of this episode. A cat got sick, and someone shot a duck. But that's it."<ref name="BBC">{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/cult/simpsons/episodeguide/season3/page19.shtml|title=Dog of Death|accessdate=2009-06-07|author=Martyn, Warren; Wood, Adrian |date=2000|publisher=BBC}}</ref> Bill Gibron of DVD Verdict commented that Santa's Little Helper's "twisted stomach means the family must budget themselves to pay for the surgery, and the results are some of the best lines in the history of the show.
