'''Raleigh Christian Academy''' ('''RCA''') is a [[Private school|private]], [[Christian]], [[coeducation]]al, [[Primary education|primary]] and [[Secondary education|secondary]] [[day school]] located in [[Raleigh, North Carolina|Raleigh]], [[North Carolina]],  [[United States]]. Also referred to as simply '''Raleigh Christian''', the school seeks to educate students in a traditional Christian environment.

==History==

In the fall of 1977, 17 students and 2 teachers met together in the facilities of Beacon Baptist Church (then named First Free Will Baptist Church) in the inaugural year of Raleigh Christian Academy. Pastor Emeritus Randy Cox chose Richard and Gwen Tippett to come and help start the school. With both teaching (and Dr. Tippett doubling as the academy principal) the school began simply with combination classes of kindergarten four and five year olds and first and second graders. Each year, another grade was added, as well as a teacher for that grade. Adding growth slowly and deliberately was by design so that the church could adjust to classroom and faculty needs in a gradual manner.

In 1987, under the leadership of Dr. Tippett, Raleigh Christian Academy produced its very first graduating class with 11 seniors receiving diplomas from the school. Since then, hundreds of students have graduated from Raleigh Christian Academy. Today, RCA has an enrollment in preschool through 12th grade of nearly 350 students, a faculty of 35, and a total staff of 60.<ref>[http://www.raleighchristian.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=category&sectionid=7&id=19&Itemid=28 Raleigh Christian Academy - History<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

==Educational Philosophy==
RCA states its educational philosophy to be as follows:

"Raleigh Christian Academy operates with a [[traditional education|traditional philosophy towards education]] meaning that:
*1. The teacher is in charge of the classroom.
*2. The teacher is responsible for providing a structured atmosphere of order in which the students will learn.
*3. The teacher has the authority to administer discipline to each child.
*4. Homework is assigned regularly and expected to be completed on time.
*5. Our textbooks are God-centered, teaching spiritual truths, morality, and patriotism.
*6. The curriculum is paced for the average student.
*7. Drill work and memorization are key tools in instruction.
*8. Reading is taught by phonics.
*9. The teacher is professional in manner, but servant-minded.
*10. True learning takes place in this order: 1st Control, 2nd Communication, 3rd Learning
*11. Rules and standards are not obsolete and outdated.
*12. God<U+2019>s Word is truth.

We are in opposition to [[progressive education]] in which the emphasis is upon the following:
*1. Questioning the answers
*2. Experimentation
*3. The innate goodness of man
*4. The suppressive nature of discipline
*5. The relativity of all things (including morals)
*6. Omitting God and his Word from the educational process
We hold that Christian education is a mandate from God to the Christian family ([[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]]
28:18-20). Because of Scripture verses like [[Book of Proverbs|Proverbs]] 19:27; 22:6; [[Deuteronomy]] 6:69;
[[Colossians]] 2:8, we feel we must provide an atmosphere more conducive to the precepts of the Bible.
We support parents that teach their children morals, such as truthfulness, purity, honesty,
patriotism, faithfulness, and a high regard for standards. Every subject is taught in light of
Bible truth. We accept God<U+2019>s Word as the final authority. Our school is a ministry and a
part of Beacon Baptist Church. We exist because of our church, and we operate in harmony
with our other church ministries."<ref>http://www.raleighchristian.com/cms/images/pdf/student%20parent%20handbook%20ms-sh.pdf</ref>

==Corporal punishment controversy==
In 1984, RCA assistant principal (and current school administrator) Dwight Ausley was found guilty of [[child abuse]], after he [[Paddle (spanking)|paddled]] a ten-year-old student who failed to complete a homework assignment. School officials stated the paddling was due to the child's defiant behavior when confronted by the teacher and not due to the missed homework assignment. When the child's mother complained to then RCA principal Richard Tippett about the punishment of her child which left bruises for three weeks, Tippett responded by giving her a taped sermon by Pastor Randy Cox (then pastor of the church associated with Raleigh Christian Academy). In the sermon, Pastor Cox paraphrased a passage from the Bible by stating, "Better a son dead than disobedient." This account has been disputed by the school. During the trial, District Attorney Deborah Shandles stated that "the child lost his breath and lost his balance and he (Ausley) was so engrossed in the beating he did not notice.... He chose to beat a 10-year-old child to teach him a lesson he would not forget for a long time, all for a homework assignment. That is not an accident, that is [[malice]]."<ref>[http://www.nospank.net/vcb.htm How to Prevent Violent Criminal Behavior in the Next Generation<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

On appeal, Ausley was found not guilty by an 11-1 vote. During the appeal, it was discovered that the noted bruising was in fact caused by corporal punishment administered post-incident at home by the child's own father. The superior court judge subsequently dismissed the case. The state appealed the dismissal which brought the case to the court of appeals. The appeals court upheld the superior court<U+2019>s decision to dismiss all charges.{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}}

The school no longer uses employee-administered corporal punishment.
