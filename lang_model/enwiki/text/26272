The '''Lowell Spinners''' are a Short-Season A [[minor league baseball]] affiliate of the [[Boston Red Sox]].

==History==
Founded in [[1996 in baseball|1996]] after Clyde Smoll moved the [[Elmira Pioneers]] to [[Lowell, Massachusetts]], the Spinners play in the [[New York - Penn League]], which has a Short-Season A classification with 76 games a year. The Spinners play 38 of the 76 games at their home park, [[Edward A. LeLacheur Park]], in Lowell, near the [[Merrimack River]]. The official [[mascot]]s of the Spinners are The Canaligator, Alligator, and Millie-Gator.

In 2005, the Spinners offered to pay for the uniforms to all [[Little League]]s in [[New England]] so that they would change all teams named "Yankees" into "Spinners".<ref>{{cite web

In 2007 [[WLLH]] 1400 A.M. (at that time Lowell's [[ESPN Radio]] affiliate) was the flagship of Lowell Spinners baseball, after several years on Lowell [[Talk radio|talk]] station [[WCAP (AM)|WCAP]].  As of 2008, Spinners games are back on WCAP.<ref>{{cite web

On September 1, 2008, the Spinners reached the NYPL (New York-Penn League) playoffs for the first time capturing the Stedler Division title. The Lowell Spinners reached the playoffs in 2009, and have not reached them since.

As of the conclusion of the 2008 Spinners season, the franchise had sold out the past 346 games dating back to prior decade. In August 2010 the streak was snapped at 413 games.  Going into the 2011 season the Spinners still have plenty of tickets for sale and hope to start a new streak.

In 2011, Lowell Spinners owner Drew Weber founded the newly formed [[Futures Collegiate Baseball League]] with a charter franchise, the [[Nashua Silver Knights]] at [[Holman Stadium (Nashua)|Holman Stadium]] in [[Nashua, NH]].
