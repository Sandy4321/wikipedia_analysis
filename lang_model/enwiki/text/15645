A '''Floorless Coaster''' is a type of [[steel roller coaster|steel]] [[roller coaster]] manufactured by [[Bolliger & Mabillard]] where riders sit with no floor underneath them allowing their feet to swing freely just above the track. Development of the Floorless Coaster began between 1995 and 1996 with [[Bizarro (Six Flags Great Adventure)|Medusa]] (now known as ''Bizarro'') at [[Six Flags Great Adventure]] opening on April 2, 1999, making it the world's first Floorless Coaster. Floorless Coasters also tend to have 3 to 7 inversions incorporated in the layout of the coaster. Recently, Bolliger & Mabillard have used floorless trains on their [[Dive Coaster]]s, such as [[Griffon (roller coaster)|Griffon]] and [[SheiKra]]. Though they contain floorless trains, the coasters are still not considered Floorless Coasters. Also, Maurer S<U+00F6>hne have designed their own version of the Floorless Coaster, a variant of their X-Car called ''X-Car Floorless'', but currently do not have any installations.<ref name=XCarFloorless>{{cite web|url=http://www.maurer-rides.com/x-coaster/floorless/ |title=X-Car Floorless |publisher=Maurer S<U+00F6>hne |date= |accessdate=March 1, 2012}}</ref>

==History==
[[Image:Medusa East.jpg|thumb|150px|left|[[Bizarro (Six Flags Great Adventure)|Bizarro]] as Medusa at [[Six Flags Great Adventure]]]]
According to Walter Bolliger, development of the Floorless Coaster began between 1995 and 1996.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBQ7tfjlMfE&feature=relmfu |title=IAAPA 2011 Trade Show Part 4 Theme Park Review Fishpipe Water Ride B&M Zamperla |publisher=Theme Park Review / YouTube |date=November 16, 2012 |accessdate=July 20, 2012}}</ref> In 1999, the world's first Floorless Coaster opened at [[Six Flags Great Adventure]] as [[Bizarro (Six Flags Great Adventure)|Medusa]]. In 2009, the coaster was renamed ''Bizarro'' and re-themed. After the success of Bolliger & Mabillard's prototype Floorless Coaster, [[SeaWorld Parks and Entertainment|SeaWorld]], [[Cedar Fair Entertainment Company|Cedar Fair]], [[Six Flags]], and independent parks, [[Janfusun Fancyworld]], [[Parque Warner Madrid]], [[Tivoli Gardens]], and [[Ocean Park Hong Kong]] have built other coasters of this model at their parks. As of 2012, there are currently 12 Floorless Coasters in operation with [[Dominator (roller coaster)|Dominator]] being the only one relocated to another park.<ref name=RCDBfcList>{{RCDB|coaster_name=Roller Coaster Search Results|location=Floorless Coaster|accessdate=July 20, 2012|url=http://www.rcdb.com/r.htm?ot=2&ml=6713&page=1&order=10}}</ref>

The design of a Floorless Coaster has one main difference between traditional steel roller coasters around the world. The main difference of this coaster is that it has no floors between the seats.<ref name="Scream leaves you dangling">{{cite news|last=Niles|first=Robert|title=Scream leaves you dangling|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2002/nov/14/news/wk-niles14|accessdate=July 21, 2012|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=November 14, 2002}}</ref> While a [[Train (roller coaster)|train]] is in the [[Station (roller coaster)|station]], a floor is used only for loading and unloading purposes. Because the front row has nothing is front of it to stop riders from walking over the edge of the station, a gate is placed in front of the train to prevent this from happening. Once all the over-the-shoulder restraints are locked, the floor separates into several pieces and moves underneath the station. The gate then opens allowing the train to move forward. When the train returns to the station, the floor is brought back up and the gate is closed as the next riders board the roller coaster.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0vA0rxIuOs |title=Dominator at Kings Dominion |publisher=woodencoasterfan (YouTube) |date=September 4, 2012 |accessdate=July 20, 2012}}</ref> Aside, from the station, a Floorless Coaster has several inversions<ref name=RCDBfcList /> similar to B&M's Sitting Coaster's.<ref name=RCDBscList>{{RCDB|coaster_name=Roller Coaster Search Results|location=Sitting Coaster|accessdate=July 20, 2012|url=http://rcdb.com/r.htm?ot=2&mo=8315}}</ref>
