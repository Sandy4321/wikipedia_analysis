==Ecumenical Councils==
From 1962-1965 Bishop Bell attended all four sessions of the [[Second Vatican Council]].  He was responsible for implementing the reforms that resulted from the Council in the diocese.  Many parishes began parish councils at this time, and he encouraged the emergence of lay ministry in the diocese.  

==Legacy==
At the same time he needed to respond to the needs of a growing diocese.  [[Solano County, California|Solano County]] was added to the diocese.  He also focused on the development of high schools throughout the diocese.  He initiated a fund drive to ease costs, build new schools, expand religious education programs and build a home for the aged.<ref name=history>[http://www.diocese-sacramento.org/diocese/history.html#1962 The Diocese of Sacramento enjoys a rich history<U+2026>] www.diocese-sacramento.org</ref>

The 17 years he spent as bishop of the diocese was a period of turbulence.  Issues from outside the diocese also affected day to day life: the [[Vietnam War]], the [[civil rights movement]] and legislative matters on [[abortion]]. Within the diocese his positive actions to aid Catholic education, improve interaction with the [[Latino]] community and renovate the interior of the [[cathedral]] were undermined by divisions, school closures, and world tensions.<ref name=history/> 

==Later life and death==
Pope [[John Paul II]] accepted his resignation on July 11, 1979 at the age of 75. Bell died as the [[Bishop_emeritus#Retired_bishops|Bishop Emeritus]] of Sacramento on August 28, 1982.
