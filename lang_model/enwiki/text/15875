The '''Ithonidae''' or '''moth lacewings''' are a small [[family (biology)|family]] of [[Pterygota|winged insects]] of the insect [[order (biology)|order]] [[Neuroptera]]. This family contains a total of nine genera, seven [[extant taxon|living]] and two [[extinct]]. The modern moth lacewings have a notably [[disjunct distribution]] while the extinct genera had a more global range. The family is considered one of the most primitive living neuropteran families. Along with the [[Polystoechotidae|giant lacewings]], moth lacewings may be [[Herbivore|phytophagous]]. 

== Description and ecology ==
Ithonidae are typically medium size [[Neuroptera|neuropterans]] that are similar in appearance to the related family [[Polystoechotidae]].<ref name="Archibald2006">{{cite journal |last = Archibald |first = S.B. |coauthors=Makarkin V.N. |title = Tertiary Giant Lacewings (Neuroptera: Polystechotidae): Revision and Description of New Taxa From Western North America and Denmark |journal = [[Journal of Systematic Palaeontology]] |volume = 4 |Issue = 2 |pages = 119<U+2013>155 |date = 2006 |url = http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&aid=438987 |accessdate =January 27, 2010 |doi=10.1017/S1477201906001817}}</ref> [[Robert John Tillyard|Robert J.

Tillyard suggested the larvae to be carnivorous, preying upon [[Scarabaeidae]] larvae, attacking with the large madibles and "sucking them dry".<ref name="Grebennikov"/>  Further study by Faulkner in 1990 has shown the immature Ithonidae to be [[Herbivore|phytophagous]], a condition unique among neuropterans.<ref name="Grebennikov"/>  The genus ''[[Rapisma]]'' was formerly considered distinct from the Ithonidae and placed in the monotypic family Rapismatidae.  Recent studies have favored inclusion into Ithonidae, but this is not always followed.

== Range ==
Modern Ithonidae genera are distributed in both the western and eastern hemispheres with one species in the [[Nearctic]] [[ecozone]], and two in the [[Neotropical]] [[ecozone]] of the western hemisphere. Of the genera in the eastern hemisphere, three are found in [[Australasia ecozone|Australasia]] and one in [[Indomalaya ecozone|Indomalaya]].  The habitats are varied with the genera falling into two general groups, arid taxa and forest taxa.<ref name="Archibald2006"/>  Those genera found in arid regions, ''[[Ithone]]'', ''[[Varnia]]'', ''[[Oliarces]]'' <ref name="Archibald2006"/> 

== Systematics and taxonomy ==
Along with [[Polystoechotidae ]], Ithonidae are regarded as the most primitive living members of Neuroptera.<ref name="Archibald2006"/> The [[clade]] formed by Ithonidae and Polystoechotidae forms a [[sister group]] to the remaining families in the suborder [[Hemerobiiformia]].<ref name="Grebennikov"/>
