The '''Alpine ibex''' (''Capra ibex''), also known as the '''steinbock''', is a species of [[Capra (genus)|wild goat]] that lives in the [[mountain]]s of the [[Europe]]an [[Alps]]. It is a [[Sexual dimorphism|sexuality dimorphic]] species with larger males who carry larger, curved horns. The coat colour is typically brownish grey. Ibex tend to live in steep, rough terrain above the [[snow line]]. They are also social, although adult males and females segregate for most of the year, coming together only to mate. Four distinct groups exist; adult male groups, female-offsping groups, groups of young individuals, and mixed sex groups. 

During the breeding season, males fight for access to females and use their long horns in [[agonistic behaviour]]s. After being [[Local extinction|extirpated]] from most areas by the 19th century, the Alpine ibex was reintroduced to parts of its historical range and all individuals living today descend from the stock in [[Gran Paradiso National Park]] in [[Northwest Italy|northwest Italy]]. The species is currently listed as of least concern by the [[IUCN]].

==Taxonomy and phylogeny==
The Alpine ibex was first described by [[Carl Linnaeus]] in 1758. It is classified in the [[genus]] ''[[Capra]]'' (Latin for "goat") with at least seven other species of wild goat. Both ''Capra'' and ''[[Ovis]]'' (sheep) descended from a [[goral]]-like animal from the [[Miocene]] and early [[Pliocene]], whose fossil are found in Kenya, China and Slovenia. The genus ''[[Tossunnoria]]'' appears in China during the late Miocene and appears to have been intermediate between gorals and goats. Fossils of Alpine ibex dating back to the late [[Pleistocene]], when it and the [[Spanish ibex]] probably evolved from the extinct Pleistocene species ''[[Capra camburgensis]]''.<ref name=Parrini2009/> The [[Nubian ibex|Nubian]] (''C. nubiana''), [[Walia ibex|Walia]] (''C. walie'') and [[Siberian ibex]] (''C. sibirica'') are sometimes considered to be subspecies of the Alpine ibex, giving populations in the Alps the [[Trinomial nomenclature|trinomial]] of ''C. i. ibex''.<ref>{{cite book|author=Shackleton, D.

Compared with other members of its genus, the Alpine ibex has a short, broad head and a duller coat. It has brownish grey hair over most of the body, a pale abdomen and slightly darker markings on the chin and throat and in a stripe along the back. They [[moult]] twice a year, firstly in April or May, and then again in September, when they replace the short summer coat with thicker hair and a woolly undercoat. As with all goats, males have beards, while females do not.<ref name=Parrini2009>{{cite journal | author = Parrini, F.; Cain III, J. W.; Krausman, P.

Males commonly grow to a height of {{convert|90|to|101|cm}} at the [[withers]], with a body length of {{convert|149|to|171|cm}} and weigh from {{convert|67|to|117|kg}}. Females are noticeably smaller, with a shoulder height of {{convert|73|to|84|cm}}, a body length of {{convert|121|to|141|cm}}, and a weight of {{convert|17|to|32|kg}}. Both male and female Alpine ibexes have large, backwards-curving, horns with numerous ridges along their length. At {{convert|69|to|98|cm}}, those of the males are substantially larger than those of females, which reach only {{convert|18|to|35|cm}} in length.<ref name=Parrini2009/>

==Distribution and ecology==
[[File:AlpineIbex.jpg|thumb|left|Ibex standing on cliff in winter.]]
The Alpine ibex was, at one point, restricted only to the Gran Paradiso National Park in northern [[Italy]], but in recent years it was both [[Reintroduction|reintroduced]] to and recolonised most of the [[European Alps]], and is also found in southeastern [[France]], southern [[Germany]], [[Switzerland]] and [[Austria]]. It was also [[Introduced species|introduced]] to [[Bulgaria]] and [[Slovenia]].<ref name=iucn/>

An excellent climber, its preferred habitat is the rocky region along the [[snow line]] above [[alpine forest]]s, where it occupies steep, rough terrain at elevations of {{convert|1800|to|3300|m}}.<ref name=Parrini2003>{{cite journal | author = Parrini, F.

===Foraging===
[[File:Chamois mp3h2247.jpg|thumb|right|Ibex foraging]]
Alpine ibexes are strictly [[herbivorous]], with over half of their diet consisting of grasses, and the remainder being a mixture of moss, flowers, leaves, and twigs.<ref name=Parrini2009/> If leaves and shoots are out of reach, they often stand on their rear legs to reach this food. Grass genera that are the most commonly eaten are ''[[Agrostis]]'', ''[[Avena]]'', ''[[Calamagrostis]]'', ''[[Festuca]]'', ''[[Phleum]]'', ''[[Poa]]'', ''[[Sesleria]]'' and ''[[Trisetum]]''.<ref name=Parrini2009/> The climbing ability of the Alpine ibex is such that it has been observed standing on the sheer face of a dam, where it licks the stonework to obtain mineral salts.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2010/nov/03/goats-italy-dam-precipitous-heights |title=The goats with a head for heights |first=Terry |last=Nutkins |date=3 November 2010 |work=Guardian.co.uk |publisher=Guardian News and Media Limited |accessdate=4 November2010}}</ref>

==Life history==
[[File:Capra ibex-maurienne01.jpg|thumb|left|Young ibex at play]]
Although the Alpine ibex is a social species, they segregate sexually and spatially depending on the season.<ref name=Francisci1985/> Four types of groups exist. Adult male groups, female-offsping groups, groups of young individuals 2<U+2013>3 years old, and mixed sex groups.<ref name=Parrini2009/><ref name=Villaret1995/> Young groups are numerous at the beginning of summer but are expelled by females at the end of their gestation period. Female and offspring groups occur year-round, at least in an area of the French Alps.<ref name=Villaret1995>{{cite journal|author=Villaret, J. C.; Bon, R.|year=1995|title=Social and spatial segregation in Alpine ibex (''Capra ibex'') in Bargy, French Alps|journal=Ethology|volume=101|issue=4|pages=291<U+2013>300}}</ref> Mixed sex groups of adult males and females occur during breeding, which lasts from December to January. By April and May, the adults separate.<ref name=Villaret1995/> The largest aggregations of either sex occur during June and July. Gatherings of males begin to decrease during October and November, and are lowest from the rut from December to March.<ref name=Villaret1995/> The males then leave their separate wintering areas and gather again.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Parrini, F.;  Grignolio, S.; Luccarini, S.; Bassano, B.; Apollonio, M.|year=2003|title=Spatial behaviour of adult male Alpine ibex ''Capra ibex ibex'' in the Gran Paradiso National Park, Italy|journal=Acta Theriologica|volume=48|issue=3|pages=411<U+2013>23|doi=10.1007/BF03194179}}</ref>

[[File:Bouquetins combat.jpg|thumb|right|Male ibex locking horns]]
There is a linear dominance hierarchy among males. In small populations, which are more cohesive, male ibex know their place in the hierarchy based on memories of past encounters<ref name=Parrini2009/> while in mobile and large groups, where encounters with strangers are common, rank is based on horn size.<ref>Schaller, G. B. (1977) ''Mountain monarchs: wild sheep and goats of the Himalaya''. University of Chicago Press. Chicago, Illinois.</ref> Antagonistic behavior in males can come in the form of "direct" or "indirect" aggression. With direct aggression, one male bumps another with its horns or places itself front of its opponent. It stands on its hind legs and comes down on his opponent with its horns. This may signal that it is ready to clash or it may be attempting a real clash.<ref name=Parrini2009/>  Indirect aggression is mostly intimidation displays.<ref name=Parrini2009/>
[[File:2006-08-06 31.jpg|left|thumb|Mother with young]]
===Reproduction and growth===
The breeding season starts in December, and typically lasts around six weeks. During this time, male herds break up into smaller groups that search for females. The rut takes place in two phases. In the first phase, the male groups interact with the females who are all in [[estrous]]. The higher the male's rank, the closer he can get to a female.<ref name=Parrini2009/> Males perform courtship displays. In the second phase of the rut, one male separates from his group to follow an individual female.  He displays to her and guards her from other males.  Before copulation, the female moves her tail and courtship becomes more intensive. They copulate and then he rejoins his group and reverts to the first phase.<ref name=Parrini2009/> Gestation lasts around 167 days, and results in the birth of one or two kids, with twins making up about 20% of births.<ref name=Stuwe1987>{{cite journal | author = St<U+00FC>we, M. & Grodinsky, C. | year = 1987 | title = Reproductive biology of captive Alpine ibex (''Capra i. ibex'') | journal = Zoo Biology | volume = 6 | issue = 4 | pages = 331<U+2013>339 | doi = 10.1002/zoo.1430060407}}</ref>

Alpine ibex reach sexual maturity at eighteen months, but females do not reach their maximum body size for five to six years, and males not for nine to eleven years. The horns grow throughout life, growing most rapidly during the second year of life, and thereafter by about {{convert|8|cm}} a year, eventually slowing to half that rate once the animal reaches ten years of age. Alpine ibex live for up to nineteen years in the wild<ref name=Toigo2007>{{cite journal | author = To<U+00CF>go, C.

==Conservation status==
[[File:Jeune bouquetin sur un rocher.jpg|thumb|right|Young Alpine ibex on a cliff]]
The Alpine ibex historically ranged through France, Italy, Switzerland, Liechtenstein, Bavaria, Austria and Slovenia. Starting in the early 1500s the overall population declined due to overexploitation and poaching and the ibex became extinct in Switzerland, Germany and France by the 18th century. Ibexes were extinct in Austria and northeastern Italy by the 19th century. They remained only in and around the Gran Paradiso Massif. Located in the western Italian Alps, the park was declared a royal hunting reserve in 1854 by [[Vittorio Emanuele II]]. Ibex were protected from poaching and their number increased, reaching 3,020 in 1914. The ibex enjoyed further protection when Gran Paradiso was made into a national park in 1922. Animals from this stock both drifted naturally and were introduced to other areas. By 1976, the number of populations of ibex numbered 104. Today, the total population of Alpine ibex is over 20,000<ref>{{cite journal|author=St<U+00FC>we, M.; Nievergelt, B.|year=1991|title=Recovery of Alpine ibex from near extinction: the result of effective protection, captive breeding, and reintroductions|journal=Applied Animal Behaviour Science|volume=29|issue=1<U+2013>4|pages=379<U+2013>87|doi=10.1016/0168-1591(91)90262-V}}</ref> and is considered to be of [[Least Concern]] by the [[IUCN]].<ref name=iucn/> However, introduced populations of ibex appear to have low genetic diversity.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Biebach, I.; Keller, L.
