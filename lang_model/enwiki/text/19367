The '''University of Surrey''' is a [[public university]] in [[Guildford]], [[England]]. It received its charter on [[9 September]] [[1966]], and was situated near [[Battersea Park]] in south-west [[London]]. The institution was known as Battersea College of Technology before gaining university status.  Its roots however go back to the Battersea Polytechnic Institute, founded in 1891 to provide further and higher education for London's poorer inhabitants.<ref name="stroamu">{{cite book |last= Douglas|first= Roy|authorlink= |coauthors= |title= Surrey- The Rise of a Modern University|year= 1991|publisher= |location= |isbn= 1-85237-067X}}</ref>

== Campus==
The university moved in 1968 to a new 30 ha (83 acre) site on Stag Hill in [[Guildford]], [[Surrey]], adjacent to [[Guildford Cathedral]] (see picture, below). A further 90 ha (228 acres) allocated to the University remained undeveloped until 2005. The new Manor Park campus, to be designed as a car-free village, is 1.6 km from the Stag Hill campus<ref>[http://portal.surrey.ac.uk/portal/page?_pageid=909,337717&_dad=portal&_schema=PORTAL University of Surrey Accommodation Services: Band D Rooms]</ref>, on the other side of the [[A3 road|A3 trunk road]], near the Research Park. It will combine residences for students and staff, buildings for research and teaching, and sporting facilities.

==Research==
The University is noted for research into small satellites, with its [[Surrey Space Centre]] and spin-off commercial company, [[Surrey Satellite Technology Ltd]]. In the 2001 [[Research Assessment Exercise]], the University of Surrey received a 5* rating in the categories of "[[Sociology]]", "Other Studies and Professions Allied to Medicine", and "Electrical and [[Electronic Engineering]]"
and a 5 rating in the categories of "[[Psychology]]", "[[Physics]]", "Applied [[Mathematics]]", "Statistics and Operational Research", "European Studies", and "Russian, Slavonic and East European Languages".<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.hero.ac.uk/rae/rae_dynamic.cfm?myURL=http://195.194.167.103/submissions/UoA.asp?HESAInst=H-0161 | title=HERO - Higher Education & Research Opportunities in the UK: RAE 2001 : Submissions | accessdate=2007-06-01}}</ref>

In addition, the [[Surrey Research Park]] is a 28 ha (70-acre) low density development which is owned and developed by the University, providing large landscaped areas with water features and facilities for over 110 companies engaged in a broad spectrum of research, development and design activities.

==History== 

The University of Surrey was preceded by the Battersea Polytechnic Institute which was founded in 1891 and admitted its first students in 1894. Its aims were to provide greater access to further and [[higher education]] for some of the 'poorer inhabitants' of [[London]]. The institute focussed on [[science]] and [[technology]] subjects, and from about 1920 taught some classes for [[University of London]] students.<ref name=Pick1>{{cite book |last=Pick |first=Christopher |title=Understanding the Real World|year=2002 |isbn= 1 85237 246 X |url= http://portal.surrey.ac.uk/pls/portal/docs/PAGE/GATEWAY/HISTORY/CHAPTER%202.PDF | page=91 }}</ref>

In 1956 the Institute was among the first to receive the designation "College of Advanced Technology" and was renamed Battersea College of Technology. By the beginning of the [[1960s|sixties]] the College had virtually outgrown its building in Battersea and had decided to move to Guildford. In addition to this, the [[Robbins Report]] of 1963 proposed that the Colleges of Advanced Technology, including Battersea, should expand and become degree-awarding Universities.<ref name="Pick1" />

In 1965 the University-designate acquired a greenfield site in Guildford from [[Guildford Cathedral]], [[Guildford (borough)|Guildford Borough]] Council and the [[Onslow Village]] Trust. The following year, on [[9 September]] [[1966]] the University of Surrey was established by [[Royal Charter]] and by 1970 the move from Battersea to Guildford was complete.<ref name=Pick1 />

Early visitors to the new campus were Led Zeppelin, who performed their very first gig at the University of Surrey on [[15 October]] [[1968]].<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.rockhall.com/inductee/led-zeppelin | title=Rock and Roll Hall of Fame: Led Zeppelin | accessdate=2007-05-15}}</ref>

In 1982 the University became the trustee of the building of the Guildford Institute and uses parts of the building for its adult education programme which ensures a University presence in the heart of Guildford. The [[Assessment and Qualifications Alliance]] (formerly Associated Examining Board) moved from [[Aldershot]] to its own headquarters building on the Stag Hill campus in 1985.

The University marked its [[Silver Jubilee]] in 1991, an event celebrated by  the publishing of ''Surrey - The Rise of a Modern University'' by Roy Douglas<ref name="stroamu" /> and by a Service of Thanksgiving in Guildford Cathedral attended by [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Her Majesty The Queen]] in March 1992.

The University celebrated its 35th anniversary year in May 2002 with a major event in Guildford Cathedral and the gift of the Surrey Scholar sculpture (by Allan Sly FBS), located at the bottom of the town's historic High Street, to the people of Guildford and marking the [[Golden Jubilee]] of Her Majesty The Queen. As of 2002 there were over 90,000 graduates of the University, working in all parts of the world. ''Understanding the Real World'', a visual history of the University, by Christopher Pick, was published to coincide with this anniversary.<ref name="Pick1" />

On [[1 July]] [[2005]] Prof. Christopher M. Snowden became Surrey<U+2019>s fourth Vice-Chancellor and Chief Executive. Like his predecessors Prof. Dowling and Prof. Kelly, Prof. Snowden is a fellow of the [[Royal Society]]. He was appointed in recognition of his pioneering work in the fields of microwave engineering and compound semiconductors.

In 2007 the University recently saw a major increase in overall applications by 39% compared with the previous year.<ref>{{cite web| title=BBC News: Are top-up fees changing courses? |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/education/6360629.stm | date =2007-02-14 | accessdate=2007-04-16}}</ref>

==Educational links==
Since its foundation, the University of Surrey has fostered links with other educational bodies in the local community and region. For example, in recent years it has validated courses at and subsequently accredited Saint Mary's College (now an independent institution called [[St Mary's University College, Twickenham]]), [[Wimbledon School of Art]] and [[Farnborough College of Technology]]. The University currently validates courses at [[North East Surrey College Of Technology]] (NESCOT), [[Guildford School of Acting|Conservatoire for Acting & Musical Theatre]], [[Guildford College|Guildford College of Further & Higher Education]], King Edward VII Hospital Department of Staff Development, The Nuclear Department at [[HMS Sultan]], [[St. John's Seminary (Wonersh)|St John's Seminary]], [[STETS|Southern Theological Education & Training Scheme (STETS)]], the Pre-Retirement Association and SHL (UK) Ltd.

In 1998, as a result of the continuing development in the relationship between the University of Surrey and the nearby Roehampton Institute, it was decided to form an academic federation. In November 1999, the [[Privy Council of the United Kingdom|Privy Council]] approved the necessary changes to the University's Charter and Statutes and the Roehampton Institute became The University of Surrey Roehampton at the beginning of 2000. Between then and 2004 then Surrey and Roehampton worked together as the [[Federal University of Surrey]]. In June 2004, the [[Privy Council of the United Kingdom|Privy Council]] granted Roehampton an independent university title, and it became [[Roehampton University]] from [[1 August]] [[2004]]. This move ended the federal partnership between the two institutions, although collaboration between the two is being maintained.

==Awards==
In 1991 the University was granted the [[Queen's Award for Export Achievement]], and in 1997 it was awarded the [[Queen's Anniversary Prize]] for Higher & Further Education in recognition of the University's outstanding achievement in satellite engineering and communications, teaching and research by the Centre for Satellite Engineering Research and its associated companies. In 1998 [[Surrey Satellite Technology Ltd]] (SSTL) was awarded the [[Queen's Award for Technological Achievement]]. This was presented in person by The Queen on her second visit to the University, accompanied by HRH [[The Duke of Edinburgh]] and HRH [[The Duke of Kent]], Chancellor of the University.

More recently the University has been awarded the 2002 [[Queen's Anniversary Prize]] for Higher & Further Education, this time for its internationally renowned research and development on [[optoelectronic devices]] and [[ion beam]] applications. For a university of its size and age, Surrey has one of the highest number of staff who are academicians of the learned societies: 10 Fellows of the [[Royal Society]], 21 Fellows of the [[Royal Academy of Engineering]], one Fellow of the [[British Academy]] and 6 Fellows of the [[Academy of Social Sciences]].

==Clubs and societies==
