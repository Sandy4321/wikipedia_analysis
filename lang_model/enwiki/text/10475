'''The Terrible Towel''' is a [[rally towel]] associated with the [[Pittsburgh Steelers]], an [[American football]] team in the [[National Football League]] (NFL). Created in 1975 by then Steelers [[Color commentator|radio broadcaster]] [[Myron Cope]], The Terrible Towel has spread in popularity; fans take their Towel to famous sites while on vacation. The Towel has been taken to the peak of [[Mount Everest]], and even into space on the [[International Space Station]]. It is widely recognized as a symbol of the Steelers and the city of [[Pittsburgh]].<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/08059/861100-66.stm|title= What people are saying ... about Myron Cope's passing|accessdate=2008-06-10 |publisher= [[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]]|date= 2008-02-28}}</ref><ref name=Yoi142>Cope 2002, p. 142.</ref> Recently, the Towel has also been used by fans at [[Pittsburgh Penguins]] games.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://penguins.nhl.com/club/news.htm?id=551461|title=Penguins Encourage Fans To Bring "Terrible Towels" To Friday's Game vs. Buffalo at CONSOL Energy Center|accessdate=2011-02-14 |publisher = [[National Hockey League]]|date= 2011-02-02}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url= http://penslabyrinth.com/2010/11/26/terrible-towel-does-the-wc/|title= Terrible Towel Does the Winter Classic|accessdate=2011-02-14 |publisher = [[Pens Labyrinth]]|date= 2010-11-26}}</ref>

Proceeds from sales of the Towel have raised over [[United States dollar|US$]]3 million for [http://www.avs.net Allegheny Valley School] [[Pennsylvania]] which cares for people with [[mental disabilities]] and [[Disability|physical disabilities]]. The Terrible Towel is credited with being the first "[[rally towel]]" and its success has given rise to similar products promoting other teams.<ref name=Copycats/> 

Because of the success of the Steelers and their national reputation, the black and gold "Terrible Towel" is the most famous sports rally towel in use.  Numerous versions have been produced; almost all are black and gold in color with the words "Myron Cope's Official The Terrible Towel" printed on the front. In October 2009 a pink Terrible Towel was introduced to promote Breast Cancer Awareness.

== Origin ==
[[File:original-terrible-towel.jpg|thumb|Original commercially marketed Terrible Towel, sold exclusively by Gimbel's Department Store, 1976]]
Two weeks prior to the Steelers' first [[National Football League playoffs|playoff game]] of the [[1975 NFL season|1975 season]], the team's [[Flagship (radio)|flagship radio station]] [[WEAE|WTAE]]'s Vice President and General Manager, Ted J. Atkins, and President of Sales, Larry Garrett, explained that they needed Cope's assistance in inventing a "gimmick" in order to attract sponsors to his daily commentaries and talk show.<ref name=Yoi142/> Initially, Cope did not want to participate, saying "I am not a gimmick guy, never ''have'' been a gimmick guy."<ref name=Yoi143>Cope 2002, p. 143.</ref> However, after Garrett's suggestion that a successful gimmick would be good leverage for a raise in Cope's upcoming [[contract]] renewal, Cope replied, "I'm a gimmick guy."<ref name=Yoi143/><ref>{{cite news |first= Gerald|last= Eskenazi|title= CHAMPIONSHIPS; The Steelers' Towel Is Not for Crying |url= http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=990CE2DF1330F932A25752C0A963958260&sec=&spon=&&scp=25&sq=Three%20Rivers%20Stadium&st=cse|work= Sports|publisher= ''[[The New York Times]]''|date= 1995-01-11|accessdate=2008-08-07}}</ref>

The three men, along with other radio station advertising personnel, began [[brainstorming]] ideas.<ref name=Yoi143/> One idea, a black mask including coach [[Chuck Noll]]'s motto "Whatever it takes", was deemed too expensive.<ref name=Yoi143/> Cope said the gimmick should be something "lightweight and portable and already owned by just about every fan."<ref name=Yoi143/> Garrett suggested using [[towel]]s. Cope agreed, suggesting the words "The Terrible Towel" be printed on the front.<ref name=Yoi143/> It was agreed that the towels would be gold or yellow, with the writing in black&mdash;the colors of the Steelers. Franklin C. Snyder, who was head of WTAE's radio and television stations, held the final approval of the idea. He approved the idea on the stipulation that black towels would also be allowed, in order to avoid accusations of [[racism]] from the [[Federal Communications Commission|FCC]]; Cope and Garrett agreed.<ref name=Yoi144>Cope 2002, p. 144.</ref>

In the weeks leading up to the game, Cope advertised the idea of the towel to fans on the radio and evening television [[news]], using the phrase "The Terrible Towel is poised to strike!"<ref name=Yoi143/> However, Atkins grew nervous that fans would think the towel was a jinx if the Steelers lost the game.<ref name=Yoi144/> Cope agreed to poll players on their view of the towel. [[Linebacker]] [[Jack Ham]] told Cope, "I think your idea stinks";<ref name=Yoi144/> [[Ernie Holmes|Ernie "Fats" Holmes]] was also against the idea.<ref name=Yoi144/> Also against the idea of the Towel was Andy Russell, who mirrored Cope's original thoughts, "We're not a gimmick team. We've never been a gimmick team."<ref name=Yoi144/> Cope simply replied, "Russell, you're sick."<ref name=Yoi145>Cope 2002, p. 145.</ref> Growing nervous about the negative feedback, Cope, who had already advertised the towel on the news multiple times, polled the rest of the players with a "[[Banana republic|banana-republic vote]]".<ref name=Yoi144/>

== Rights, marketing and proceeds ==
Upon the sudden popularity of the Terrible Towel, Pittsburgh area department stores sold out all gold and black hand towels.<ref name=About/> Because the hand towels were often sold as a set, with matching bath towels, stores were left with un-even sets.<ref name=About/> In the fall of 1978, Bernard Pollock, divisional marketing manager of Gimbel's Department Store came up with the idea of putting a Terrible Towel logo on hand towels and sold the idea to Cope. The first Terrible Towels hit the marketplace on December 20, 1978 at $6 apiece. Gimbel's could not stock them fast enough.<ref>[http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=g4BIAAAAIBAJ&sjid=-W0DAAAAIBAJ&dq=gimbels%20terrible-towel&pg=5423%2C4363561 Pittsburgh Post-Gazette], 1979-12-27, page 18.</ref><ref>[http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=RZ5RAAAAIBAJ&sjid=qm0DAAAAIBAJ&dq=gimbels%20terrible-towel&pg=2014%2C3715525 Pittsburgh Post-Gazette], 1979-07-30, page 3.</ref> Gimbel's has since gone out of business. The original version of The Terrible Towel was manufactured by St. Mary's Inc. of New York, NY and was available in two colors: Gold and Black.

Upon its invention, Cope commented on the multi-functional ability of The Terrible Towel, "I'll tell 'em they can use the towel to wipe their seats clean. They can use it as a muffler against the cold. They can drape it over their heads if it rains."<ref name=Yoi143>Cope 2002, p. 143.</ref> However, the towel is often used by fans who do not attend games.
