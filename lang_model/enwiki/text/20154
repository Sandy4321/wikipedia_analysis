'''Bristol Temple Meads railway station''' is the oldest and largest [[railway station]] in [[Bristol]], [[England]]. It is an important interchange hub for [[public transport in Bristol]], with [[bus]] services to various parts of the city and surrounding districts, and a [[ferry]] service to the city centre in addition to the train services. Bristol's other main-line station, [[Bristol Parkway railway station|Bristol Parkway]], is on the northern outskirts of the Bristol [[conurbation]].

It opened on [[31 August]] [[1840]] as the western terminus of the [[Great Western Railway]] from [[London Paddington station]].  The whole railway including Temple Meads was the first major work completed by the prolific [[United Kingdom|British]] [[engineer]], [[Isambard Kingdom Brunel]].  Soon the station was also used by the [[Bristol and Exeter Railway]], the [[Bristol and Gloucester Railway]], the [[Bristol Harbour Railway]] and the [[Bristol and South Wales Union Railway]]. To accommodate the increasing number of trains the station was expanded in the 1870s by [[Francis Fox (engineer)|Francis Fox]]; and again in the 1930s by [[P E Culverhouse]].  Brunel's terminus is no longer part of the operational station, instead it currently houses the [[British Empire and Commonwealth Museum]] which, along most of the newer buildings, are [[listed building|listed Grade 1]].

Temple Meads is now owned by [[Network Rail]] and is operated under a [[government-granted monopoly|franchise]] by [[First Great Western]] who provide the majority of trains to [[London]], along with local services and inter-urban routes to destinations such as [[Cardiff Central railway station|Cardiff]], [[Southampton Central railway station|Southampton]], [[Portsmouth Harbour railway station|Portsmouth]] and [[Weymouth railway station|Weymouth]]. Long-distance services are provided by [[CrossCountry]] to destinations as diverse as [[Plymouth railway station|Plymouth]] and [[Penzance railway station|Penzance]] in the West of England, [[Manchester Piccadilly railway station|Manchester Piccadilly]] and [[York railway station|York]] in the North, and [[Edinburgh Waverley railway station|Edinburgh]] and [[Aberdeen railway station|Aberdeen]] in [[Scotland]]. A few trains to [[London Waterloo station]] are provided by [[South West Trains]].

More than 6.5 million people entered and left the station in the twelve months to March 2007, an increase of nearly 1.5 million in five years.  This makes it the 37th most-used Network Rail station and the 15th-busiest outside the central [[London]] area. In addition, it was estimated that more than 900,000 people used the station to change trains.<ref>{{cite web| last = Office of Rail Regulation| title =Station usage| publisher = Office of Rail Regulation| date =2006| url = http://www.rail-reg.gov.uk/upload/xls/station-usage-2006-07.xls| accessdate = 2008-06-23}}</ref>

The [[Railway platform|platforms]] are numbered from 1 to 15, but passenger trains are confined to just eight tracks. The numbering system means that most are numbered separately at each end with odd numbers at the east end, and even numbers at the west end.  To further complicate matters, platform 2 is not signalled for passenger trains, and platform 14 does not exist.

==History==
The name of the station, ''Temple Meads'', derives from the nearby [[Temple Church, Bristol|Temple Church]], which was built by the [[Knights Templar]] in the [[12th century]], rebuilt in the [[14th century]], and gutted by bombing during [[World War II]].<ref>{{cite web | title=Temple Church | work=Images of England | url=http://www.imagesofengland.org.uk/search/details.aspx?id=380791 | accessdate=2006-07-28}}</ref> The word "m<U+00E6>ds" is an [[Old English language|Old English]] derivation of [[meadow]], referring to the water meadows alongside the [[River Avon, Bristol|River Avon]] that were part of Temple [[parish]]. As late as 1820 the site was undeveloped [[pasture]] outside the boundaries of the old city,<ref name="lobel">{{cite book |last=Lobel|first=MD|authorlink= |coauthors= |title=The Atlas of Historic Towns, Volume 2|year=1975 |publisher=The Scolar Press in conjunction with The Historic Towns Trust|location=London |isbn=0859671852}}</ref> some distance from the commercial centre. It lay between the [[Bristol Harbour|Floating Harbour]] and the city's cattle market, which was built in 1830.

===Brunel's station===
[[Image:Bristol Temple Meads old station frontage (750px).jpg|thumb|left|Brunel's original station now houses the [[British Empire and Commonwealth Museum]].]]
The original terminal station was built in 1839-41 for the [[Great Western Railway]] (GWR), the first passenger railway in Bristol, and was designed by [[Isambard Kingdom Brunel]], the railway's engineer.<ref name=Pevsner>{{cite book| last = Foyle| first = Andrew| title = Pevsner Architectural Guides: Bristol| publisher = Yale University Press| date = 2004| location = New Haven and London| id = ISBN 0-300104-42-1}}</ref> For his first railway, Brunel chose to use the {{RailGauge|84}} [[broad gauge]] for this line. He went on to use the gauge for many more of the railways that he built in South and West [[Great Britain|Britain]].  The station was on a [[viaduct]] to raise it above the level of the Floating Harbour and River Avon; the latter being crossed via the grade I [[listed building|listed]] [[Avon Bridge]]. The station was covered by a {{convert|200|ft|m}} [[train shed]] which was extended beyond the platforms by {{convert|155|ft|m}} into a storage area and [[motive power depot|engine shed]], which in turn was fronted by an office building in the [[Tudor style architecture|Tudor style]].<ref name=Binding>{{cite book| last = Binding| first = John| title = Brunel's Bristol Temple Meads| publisher = Oxford Publishing Company| date = 2001| location = Hersham| id = ISBN 0-860935-63-9}}</ref> Train services to [[Bath Spa railway station|Bath]] commenced on [[31 August]] [[1840]] and were extended to [[London Paddington station]] from [[30 June]] [[1841]] following the completion of [[Box Tunnel]].<ref name=MacD1>{{cite book| last = MacDermot| first = E T| title = History of the Great Western Railway, volume I 1833-1863| publisher = [[Great Western Railway]]| date = 1927| location = London}}</ref>

A few weeks before the start of the services to Paddington the [[Bristol and Exeter Railway]] (B&ER) had opened on [[14 June]] [[1841]],<ref name=MacD2>{{cite book| last = MacDermot| first = E T| title = History of the Great Western Railway, volume II 1863-1921| publisher = [[Great Western Railway]]| date = 1931| location = London}}</ref> its trains reversing in and out of the GWR station. The third railway at Temple Meads was the [[Bristol and Gloucester Railway]] which opened on [[8 July]] [[1844]] but was taken over by the [[Midland Railway]] (MR) on [[1 July]] [[1845]].<ref name=MacD1/> This again used the GWR platforms, diverging onto its own line on the far side of the bridge over the Floating Harbour. Both these new railways were engineered by Brunel and their lines too were initially built to the broad gauge.<ref name=MacD2/> Brunel also designed the [[Bristol and South Wales Union Railway]], but this was not opened until [[25 August]] [[1863]], nearly four years after his death. It too terminated at Temple Meads.

===Bristol and Exeter Railway station===
[[Image:Bristol and Exeter House.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Bristol and Exeter Railway]] headquarters]]
In 1845 the B&ER built its own station at right angles to the GWR station and also an "express [[Railway platform|platform]]" on the curve linking the two lines so that through trains no longer had to reverse. The wooden B&ER station was known locally as "The Cowshed";<ref name=Binding/> but a grand headquarters was built at street level on the west side of its station in 1852-54 to the [[Jacobean architecture|Jacobean]] designs of [[Samuel Fripp]].<ref name=Pevsner/> The [[Bristol and Portishead Pier and Railway]] opened a branch off the Bristol and Exeter line west of the city on [[18 April]] [[1867]], the trains being operated by the B&ER and using their platforms at Temple Meads.<ref name=awdry>{{Awdry-RailCo}}, P 19.</ref>

In 1850 an [[Traction Maintenance Depot|engine shed]] had been opened on the south bank of the River Avon on the east side of the lines leading to the B&ER station.<ref>{{cite book| last = Lyons| first = E| coauthors = Mountford, E| title = Great Western Engine Sheds 1837-1947| publisher = Oxford Publishing Company| date = 1979| location = Poole| id = ISBN 0-860930-19-X}}</ref> Between 1859 and 1875, 23 new engines were built in the workshops attached to the shed, including several of the distinctive [[Bristol and Exeter Railway 4-2-4T locomotives]].<ref>{{cite book| title = The Locomotives of the Great Western Railway, Part 2: Broad Gauge| publisher = The Railway Correspondence and Travel Society| date=1953| id = ISBN 0-90686-790-8}}</ref>

===Goods stations===
The GWR built a {{convert|326|ft|m|0}} by {{convert|138|ft|m|0}} [[goods shed]] on the north side of the station adjacent to the Floating Harbour, with a small dock for [[transhipment]] of goods to [[barge]]s (though not to sea-going ships as the wharf was upstream of [[Bristol Bridge]]). Wagons had to be lowered {{convert|12|ft|m|0}} to the goods shed on [[elevator|hoists]]. On [[11 March]] [[1872]] a direct connection to the harbour was made in the form of the [[Bristol Harbour Railway]], a joint operation of the three railways, which ran between the passenger station and the goods yard, across the street outside on a bridge, and then descended into a tunnel under the churchyard of [[St. Mary Redcliffe]] on its way to a wharf in a more convenient position downstream of Bristol Bridge.<ref name=Binding/>

The B&ER had a goods depot at Pylle Hill (south of the station) from 1850; and the MR had an independent yard at Avonside Wharf on the opposite side of the Floating Harbour from 1858.<ref name=Maggs>{{cite book| last = Maggs| first = Colin| title = Rail Centres: Bristol| publisher = Ian Allan| date = 1981| location = Shepperton| id = ISBN 0-711011-43-2}}</ref>

===Effects of the change of gauge===
On [[29 May]] [[1854]] the Midland Railway had laid a third rail along their tracks from Bristol to Gloucester to give a [[Dual gauge|mixed gauge]] so that they could operate {{RailGauge|ussg}} [[standard gauge]] passenger trains while broad gauge goods trains could still run to [[Colliery|collieries]] north of Bristol. Sidings at South Wales Junction allowed traffic to be transhipped between wagons on the two different gauges. The GWR continued to operate its trains on the broad gauge,<ref name=MacD1/> but on [[3 September]] [[1873]] it opened the standard gauge [[Bristol and North Somerset Railway]]. This had a junction nearly {{convert|0.5|mi|km|sing=on}} from the station on the London line and so the mixed gauge was extended to that point. During the following year mixed gauge track was continued beyond Bath in connection with the conversion of the [[Wilts, Somerset and Weymouth Railway]] to standard gauge. The mixed gauge was then laid through [[Box Tunnel]] on [[16 May]] [[1875]] and so standard gauge trains could run from Bristol all the way to London, although the broad gauge was retained west of Temple Meads and through trains from London to [[Penzance railway station|Penzance]] and other stations in [[Devon]] and [[Cornwall]] continued to be formed of broad gauge trains.<ref name=MacD2/> Goods traffic was transhipped between the two gauges in the B&ER yard at Pylle Hill.

The B&ER converted to mixed gauge the line from Bristol as far as [[Taunton railway station|Taunton]] by [[1 June]] [[1875]], but the remainder of the line to [[Exeter St Davids railway station|Exeter]] was not done until [[1 March]] [[1876]], three months after the B&ER had [[Consolidation (business)|amalgamated]] with the GWR. The remainder of the lines beyond Exeter were converted to standard gauge on [[21 May]] [[1892]]<ref name=MacD2/> so the extra rails at Temple Meads fell into disuse and were removed to leave a purely standard gauge layout. This allowed the through station to be rebuilt with two additional platform faces.<ref name=Binding/>

===1870s expansion===
[[Image:Gare de Bristol.jpg|thumb|left|The main entrance to the station built in the 1870s between the terminal and through platforms. The tower was topped by a spire until [[World War 2]]]]
The additional railway routes put the two short &ndash; {{convert|140|yd|m}} &ndash; platforms of Brunel's terminus under pressure and so a scheme was developed to extend the station. An enabling [[Act of Parliament]] was passed in 1865 and between 1871 and 1878 the station was extensively rebuilt. Brunel's platforms were extended by {{convert|212|yd|m}} towards London, and a new three-platform through station built on the site of the express platform, while the B&ER station was closed and the site used for a new carriage shed.<ref name=Oakley>{{cite book| last = Oakley| first = Mike| title = Bristol Railway Stations 1840-2005| publisher = The Dovecote Press| date = 2002| location = Wimbourne| id = ISBN 1-904349-09-9}}</ref> This work is usually attributed to Brunel's former associate [[Matthew Digby Wyatt]], however there is no documentary evidence of his involvement in the Minutes of the Station Joint Committee. The only signature on the drawings is that of [[Francis Fox (engineer)|Francis Fox]] who was the engineer of the B&ER.<ref name=rebuilding>{{cite journal| last = Nichols| first = Gerry| title = Rebuilding Temple Meads Passenger Station 1870 to 1875| journal = Broadsheet| issue = 54| pages = 8<U+2013>15| publisher = Broad Gauge Society| date = 2005 }}</ref> The curved [[wrought-iron]] train shed over the new through platforms was {{convert|500|ft|m}} long on the platform wall. The goods depot was rebuilt with the inconvenient wagon hoists replaced by a steep incline connection from the east end of Temple Meads, which meant that the sidings in the goods shed were turned at right angles to their original alignment and the barge dock was filled in.<ref name=Maggs/>

Trains on the Bristol and South Wales Union and the [[Midland Railway|Midland]] routes operated from the terminal platforms while GWR services used the new through platforms.<ref name=Binding/> The [[Capital (economics)|capital]] costs of the new work were split 4/14 GWR/B&ER and 10/14 MR. The ongoing costs were split GWR 3/8, MR 3/8 and B&ER 2/8. Hence when the GWR absorbed the B&ER in 1876 the split was GWR 5/8 and MR (later [[London, Midland and Scottish Railway|LMS]]) 3/8 until nationalisation on [[1 January]] [[1948]].<ref name=rebuilding/>

===Twentieth century changes===
[[Image:Bristol Temple Meads from Bath Road bridge.jpg|thumb|right|A view looking northwards from Bath Road. The 1870s arched [[train shed]] is surrounded by the flatter canopies of the newer platforms opened in 1935.]]
In 1924 the goods depot was rebuilt with 15 platforms, each {{convert|575|ft|m}} long. Large warehousing and cellar space was provided to store goods; although by this time another city centre goods depot had been opened at [[Cabot, Bristol#Canon's Marsh|Canons Marsh]].<ref name=Maggs/>

Between 1930 and 1935 the through station was expanded under the direction of architect [[P E Culverhouse]], both eastwards over the old cattle market, and southwards on a new wider bridge across Cattle Market Road and the New Cut of the River Avon. This made room for the addition of five new through-platform faces, while the removal of the narrow island platforms in the middle of the train shed allowed the main Up and Down platforms to be both widened and lengthened.<ref name=Oakley/> All the routes approaching Temple Meads were widened to four tracks to allow more flexibility.<ref name=Maggs/>

As part of this work four existing [[Lever frame|manual]] [[signal box]]es were replaced by three new Power Signal Boxes; and the [[Railway semaphore signal|semaphore signals]] and [[Railroad switch|mechanical point]] linkages were replaced by [[British railway signals|colour light signals]] and point motors. The new Bristol Temple Meads East box was the largest on the GWR with 368 miniature levers operated by three signalmen assisted by a "booking boy". The other two boxes were one at Bristol Temple Meads West, and one controlling the movements in and out of the new [[Bristol Bath Road TMD|Bath Road Depot]] which replaced the old B&ER locomotive works in 1934.<ref name=Maggs/>

During [[World War 2]] the station was bombed, which led to the destruction of the wooden spire of the clock tower above the ticket office on [[3 January]] [[1941]].<ref name=Oakley/> [[Gas lighting]] was replaced by [[fluorescent lamp|fluorescent]] electric lights in 1960.<ref name=Maggs/>

A second main-line station serving Bristol, [[Bristol Parkway railway station|Bristol Parkway]], opened in 1972. It is on the northern outskirts of the Bristol [[conurbation]] close to the [[M32 motorway]] and was initially designed as a [[park and ride]] facility for long-distance travellers.<ref name=Butt>{{Butt-Stations}}</ref> 

In 1990-91 <U+00A3>2,000,000 was spent on a renovation of the main train shed and another <U+00A3>7,000,000 on restoring some of the older areas of the station, including the refurbishment of the subway and construction of new retail outlets. The shorter of the two 1935 platform islands had been used only for parcels traffic since the 1960s but was temporarily brought back into passenger use during this work. It was fully restored for passenger use in 2001.<ref name=Oakley/>

===Closure of lines===
Passenger traffic on the old North Somerset line ceased on [[2 November]] [[1959]] but many more closures followed after the publication of [[Richard Beeching|Dr Beeching's]] ''[[Beeching Axe|The Reshaping of British Railways]]'' in 1963. The connection to the Bristol Harbour Railway was closed on [[6 January]] [[1964]]; passenger trains to [[Bristol and Portishead Pier and Railway|Portishead]] were withdrawn on [[7 September]] [[1964]]; and most local services in the north of the city were withdrawn on [[23 November]] [[1964]]. The following year saw local services on the Midland Railway route to Gloucester withdrawn<ref name=Avon>{{cite book| title = Railways in Avon, a short history of their development and decline 1832 - 1982| publisher = Avon County Planning Department| date = 1983| location = Bristol| id = ISBN 0-860631-84-2}}</ref>  and the former Midland route to [[Bath Green Park railway station|Bath Green Park]] via [[Mangotsfield railway station|Mangotsfield]] was closed on [[7 March]] [[1966]]. [[St Anne's Park railway station|St Anne's Park]] and [[Saltford railway station|Saltford]] on the line towards Bath survived until [[5 January]] [[1970]].<ref name=Avon/>

On [[12 September]] [[1965]] the terminal platforms were closed.  This allowed the platforms to be renumbered but the with the order being reversed (see list below).<ref name=Maggs/>  The redundant train shed became a covered car park in February the following year, but from 1989 until 1999 Brunel's station was an interactive science centre known as The Exploratory and exhibition space.  It is now the [[British Empire and Commonwealth Museum]], although the BE&CM intends to relocate to London.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.empiremuseum.co.uk/aboutus/relationalnews.htm#move |title=News |accessdate=2007-03-13 |format= |work=British Empire and Commonwealth Museum }}</ref>

Bristol Panel Signal Box was built on the site of the Platform 14 after it closed. When opened it controlled 280 multiple-aspect signals and 243 motor-worked points on {{convert|114|mi|km}} of routes around Bristol, the largest area controlled by a single signal box on [[British Rail]] at the time.<ref>{{cite journal| last = Kitchenside| first = GM| title = The Bristol resignalling scheme controls the crossroads of the West| journal = Modern Railways| volume = 30| issue = 292| pages = 10<U+2013>15| publisher = Ian Allan| date = 1973| accessdate = }}</ref>

==Description==
{{wide image|Bristol Temple Meads, panaroma from south.jpg|1024px|View of station from the south. The main approach is from the left, behind the brown brick offices (Collett House).  The turrets behind these belong to Bristol & Exeter House which hides Brunel's building.  Fox's extension can be seen to the right of Bristol & Exeter House, linking Brunel's station with the large arch of the main train shed.  The flatter canopies belong to Culverhouse's 1935 extensions, with platform 4 on the extreme left and Platform 15 partly hidden by the trees on the right.  The lower modern buildings behind the station are the Temple Quay office complex which stands on the site of the old goods shed.  The demolition rubble in the foreground is the remains of [[Bristol Bath Road TMD]].}}

===Approaches===
[[Image:Bristol Temple Meads approach road (750px).jpg|thumb|left|The station approach looks straight towards Fox's [[turret]]ed 1870s station entrance. Part of Brunel's original station on the left with Fox's 1870s extension between that and the entrance; the current station [[train shed]] is to the right of the entrance.]]
Although it is now possible to reach the [[Railway station|station]] through the Temple Quay office development (which is on the former site of the [[goods shed]]), or from the [[Bristol Ferry Boat]] landing stage on the [[Bristol Harbour|Floating Harbour]], the traditional and main approach is from Temple Gate. [[Isambard Kingdom Brunel]]'s Tudor-style offices, now the [[British Empire and Commonwealth Museum]], face this road and are flanked on the north side by an archway that used to be the main station entrance for departing passengers; a matching arch on the other side was the arrivals gateway but was removed when the station was expanded in the 1870s.<ref name=Binding/>

Opposite these offices are the Grovesnor Hotel and the derelict George Railway Hotel which were built in the 1870s<ref name=Pevsner/> on either side of the [[Bristol Harbour Railway]] bridge. A modern [[pub]] named The Reckless Engineer as a tribute to Brunel faces the approach road that rises up to the station.

On the right of this Station Approach but at a lower level is the B&ER office building designed by [[Samuel Fripp]]; the 1930s offices known as "[[Charles Collett|Collett]] House" and a disused parcels depot lie beyond. On the left is Brunel's original station building.  The [[train shed]] is {{convert|72|ft|m}} wide with a wooden box-frame roof and [[cast iron]] columns disguised as [[Hammerbeam roof|hammerbeams]] above Tudor arches. It is believed to be the widest hammerbeam roof in England and, along with most of the station, is a Grade 1 [[listed building]],<ref>{{cite web | title=Bristol Old Station, Temple Meads  | work=Images of England | url=http://www.imagesofengland.org.uk/details/default.aspx?id=380662 | accessdate=2007-03-13}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | title=Temple Meads Station | work=Images of England | url=http://www.imagesofengland.org.uk/details/default.aspx?id=380663 | accessdate=2007-03-16}}</ref> and forms part of a proposed Great Western Railway [[World Heritage Site]].<ref name=UNESCO>{{cite web | title = The Great Western Railway: Paddington-Bristol (selected parts) | publisher = United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation | date = 1999 | url = http://whc.unesco.org/en/tentativelists/1319/  | accessdate = [[22 May]] [[2008]]}}</ref>  At the top of the slope an entrance on the left to the covered car park marks the junction between the original terminus and Fox's 1870s extension.

Ahead is the [[turret]]ed main station building, and to the right a flat area marks the site of the B&ER station. The tunnel beneath this area was the route for passengers to and from the Down platform of the station from 1878 until the station was enlarged in 1935.<ref name=Oakley/>

===Station===
Entering the main building, the ticket office and ticket machines are immediately ahead, and the route from Temple Quay and the ferry is on the left; a bookshop is on the right, next to the platform entrance. Customer Information System screens by the entrance show the arrival and departure information (including any delays) for next services on all platforms, as do local displays on each of the [[Railway platform|platforms]]. All platforms are signalled for trains in either direction and the flexible layout means that trains on any route can use any part of the station.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.livedepartureboards.co.uk/ldb/station.aspx?T=BRI|title=BRI Network Rail Live Departures and Arrivals|work=National Rail Enquiries|accessdate=2008-07-04}}</ref> At Temple Meads platforms with odd numbers are at the east end, and those with even numbers at the west end (though geographically this is the south due to the curvature of the platforms).<ref name=Quail>{{cite book| last = Jacobs| first = Gerald| title = Railway Track Diagrams Book 3: Western| publisher = Trackmaps| date = 2005| location = Bradford-on-Avon| id = ISBN 0-954986-61-X}}</ref>

[[Image:Bristol Temple Meads, automatic ticket gates and platform 3.jpg|thumb|right|Platform 3 and the ticket gates that control entrance to the platforms]]
Entrance to the platforms is controlled by automatic ticket gates and is situated on Platform 3 which is used by many of the northbound [[CrossCountry]] trains and local services to [[Bristol Parkway railway station|Bristol Parkway]] and [[Gloucester railway station|Gloucester]]. The main station restaurant and bar is on the left<ref name=details>{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalrail.co.uk/stations/BRI/details.html|title=Station Facilities: Bristol Temple Meads|work=National Rail Enquiries|accessdate=2008-07-04}}</ref> and the short Platform 1, a terminus [[Bay platform|bay]], is beyond this. This is most frequently used by [[Severn Beach Line]] trains but is long enough to handle any four-car [[Diesel Multiple Unit]] (DMU) that does not need to run through to the west. Behind Platform 1 is a brick wall that forms part of the Panel Signal Box and on this are some metal artworks created by artists with learning difficulties to celebrate Brunel's 200th anniversary in 2006; an interpretation panel can be found nearby. The High Level Siding beyond Platform 1 is the rump of the Bristol Harbour Railway, and [[Barton Hill TMD]] ([[Traction Maintenance Depot]]) can be seen in the distance alongside Bristol East Junction (formerly South Wales Junction) where the lines to Bristol Parkway and Bath diverge. The large grey box structure above the tracks at this end of the station is a bridge installed in the 1970s for postal traffic; it links with the derelict sorting office beyond Platform 15.

On the right of the entrance is the subway that links all the platforms (it can be reached either by steps or [[elevator|lift]]);<ref name=details/> it houses the main public toilets, [[automated teller machine]]s (ATM) and several catering outlets (there is catering on all [[Island platform|platform islands]] except 13-15). A passenger information office and lounge is situated above the subway, the [[British Transport Police]] office and passenger cycle racks are beyond,<ref name=details/> and at the far end is Platform 4 which is occasionally used by trains heading westwards. Alongside this is Platform 2, another bay platform but this is not signalled for passenger services and is now only used for stabling empty trains, as is the former [[Motorail]] unloading bay alongside. At the far end of this track is the old Fish Dock which is occasionally used for stabling engineers' on-track equipment. Beyond the end of the platform the tracks swing to the right (the west) and pass out-of-sight beneath Bath Road Bridge, a girder bridge that carries the [[A4 road]] out of the city.

The first platform island comprises platforms 5 to 8. Platforms 5 is inside the main train shed while 6 is a southerly extension and 7 and 8 were added outside the supporting wall in the 1930s.<ref name=Oakley/> Platform 5 is used by many trains towards [[Cardiff Central railway station|Cardiff]] and platform 7 for those to [[Portsmouth Harbour railway station|Portsmouth]]; platforms 6 and 8 are the main platforms for trains to [[Weston-super-Mare railway station|Weston-super-Mare]] and stations as far as [[Penzance railway station|Penzance]]. Between platforms 5 and 7 are the two Spur Sidings <!-- capatised as this is their proper name--> that are long enough to stable a single [[British Rail Class 143|Class 143 railbus]] or [[British Rail Class 153|Class 153 DMU]].

<!--where's the second island platform ?-->
The third platform island comprises platforms 9 to 12 and also dates from the 1930s.<ref name=Oakley/> It is longer than platforms 5-8 but the rear of a [[Inter City 125|High Speed Train]] on the west end platforms will block part of the east end platform.<ref name=Quail/> A wide variety of trains use these platforms, including trains to and from London Paddington and [[London Waterloo station]]s and also [[Weymouth railway station|Weymouth]].

The final platform island is shorter and only has east-end platforms 13 and 15, although 15 is used by most trains from Paddington that continue westwards from Temple Meads to Weston-super-Mare or beyond. Platform 13 is a terminus platform and is used by many trains from London Paddington and some local services too. There is another siding beyond platform 15 that used to be the In/Out Road for [[Bristol Bath Road TMD|Bath Road Traction Maintenance Depot]]. This depot has been demolished and is being redeveloped for non-railway purposes. Between platforms 3/4 and 5/6 are the Up Through line and the Middle Siding; the Down Through line runs between platforms 11/12 and 13.<ref name=Quail/>

Other facilities include pay phones, public [[WiFi]], a post box, photo booth, and passenger assistance such as information points, waiting rooms, a lost property office, first aid room, and [[CCTV]].<ref name=details/>
