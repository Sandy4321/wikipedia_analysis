The '''Battle of Osan''' was the first engagement between [[United States]] and [[North Korea]]n forces during the [[Korean War]], on July 5, 1950. A U.S. task force of 400 infantry supported by an artillery battery were moved to [[Osan]], south of the South Korean capital [[Seoul]], and ordered to delay advancing North Korean forces for as long as possible while more U.S. forces arrived in the country to support them.

In the ensuing battle, the American force, nicknamed Task Force Smith, was unable to repel the North Koreans' [[T-34]] tanks. Ammunition and weapons designed to combat the heavily armored tanks had not been widely distributed to [[U.S. Army]] forces in Korea at the time, and the Task Force only had a few rounds of effective [[howitzer]] ammunition. The Task Force's outdated equipment could not penetrate the North Korean armor. Able to stop only a few of them, a column of North Korean tanks passed through the Task Force lines and headed toward Osan.

Following the tank column, 5,000 North Korean troops assaulted the Task Force, which held them at bay for several hours.  Eventually, the North Korean troops [[Flanking maneuver|overwhelmed the U.S. flanks]]. In the subsequent retreat, several injured U.S. soldiers remained behind, some of them later executed by the North Koreans. Although far outnumbered, Task Force Smith was able to delay the North Korean forces for several hours, buying time for more American forces to assemble lines south of Osan.

==Background==
===Outbreak of war===
::''Main Article:  [[Korean War#Police Action: US intervention|Initial Phase of Korean War]]
On the night of June 25, 1950, ten divisions of the [[North Korean People's Army]] launched a full-scale invasion on the nation's neighbor to the south, the [[Republic of Korea]]. The force of 89,000&nbsp;men moved in six columns, catching the [[Republic of Korea Army]] by surprise, resulting in a complete rout. The smaller South Korean army suffered from widespread lack of organization and equipment, and it was unprepared for war.<ref>Alexander, p. 1.</ref> Numerically superior, North Korean forces destroyed isolated resistance from the 38,000&nbsp;South Korean soldiers on the front before it began moving steadily south.<ref>Alexander, p. 2.</ref> Most of South Korea's forces retreated in the face of the invasion. By June 28, the North Koreans had captured South Korea's capital of [[Seoul]], forcing the government and its shattered forces to retreat further south.<ref>Varhola, p. 2.</ref>

To prevent South Korea's complete collapse, the [[United Nations Security Council]] voted to send military forces. The United States' [[United States Seventh Fleet|Seventh Fleet]] dispatched [[Task Force 77 (U.S. Navy)|Task Force 77]], led by the [[fleet carrier]] [[USS Valley Forge (CV-45)|USS ''Valley Forge'']]; the [[United Kingdom|British]] [[Far East Fleet]] dispatched several ships, including the [[HMS Triumph (R16)|HMS ''Triumph'']], to provide air and naval support.<ref>Malkasian, p. 23.</ref> Although the navies blockaded North Korea and launched aircraft to delay the North Korean forces, these efforts alone did not stop the North Korean Army juggernaut on its southern advance.<ref name="Malk24">Malkasian, p. 24.</ref>  To supplement the air support, U.S. President [[Harry S. Truman]] ordered ground troops into the country.<ref name="Var3">Varhola, p. 3.</ref> However, the strength of U.S. forces in the [[Far East]] had steadily declined since the end of [[World War II]] five years earlier and the closest units were the [[24th Infantry Division (United States)|24th Infantry Division]] of the [[Eighth United States Army]],  headquartered in [[Japan]].  Cuts in U.S. military spending meant the division was under strength and using outmoded equipment.<ref name="Var3"/>

Division commander, [[Major General (United States)|Major General]] [[William F. Dean]] determined that the [[21st Infantry Regiment (United States)|21st Infantry Regiment]] was the most combat-ready of the 24th Infantry Division's three regiments. From the formation, Dean decided to send the 21st Infantry's 1st Battalion because its commander, [[Lieutenant Colonel]] Charles B. Smith, was the most experienced leading men, having commanded a battalion at the [[Battle of Guadalcanal]] during World War II. From the [[division (military)|division]] garrison, [[C-54 Skymaster]] transport aircraft airlifted one battalion under Smith's command into Korea.  The battalion deployed quickly to block advancing North Korean forces, performing a holding action while the rest of the division could be moved to South Korea by sea.<ref name="USAJ">{{cite web|url=http://www.usarj.army.mil/history/tfsmith.aspx |title=Task Force Smith Informational Paper |publisher=[[United States Army Japan]] |accessdate=2009-11-29}}</ref>

===Task Force Smith===
<blockquote>When you get to Pusan, head for Taejon. We want to stop the North Koreans as far from Pusan as we can. Block the main road as far north as possible. Make contact with General Church.

Good luck, and God bless you and your men!<br><br><U+2013>Major General William F. Dean's orders to Colonel Smith<ref name="Alex55"/></blockquote>

The first units of the 24th Infantry Division left [[Itazuke Air Base]] in Japan on June 30.<ref>Varhola, p. 74.</ref> Named for its commander, Task Force Smith consisted of 406 men of the 1st Battalion, 21st Infantry Regiment, as well as 134 men of A Battery, 52nd Field Artillery Battalion under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Miller O. Perry.<ref name="Alex58">Alexander, p. 58.</ref> The forces were poorly equipped; 1st Battalion, 21st Infantry had only two [[company (military)|companies]] of [[infantry]], B Company and C Company, as opposed to the regulation three for a U.S. Army battalion. The battalion had half of the required number of troops in its [[Headquarters Company]], half of a communications [[platoon (military)|platoon]], and half of a heavy weapons platoon, which was armed with six [[bazooka|2.36-inch bazooka]]s, two [[M20 recoilless rifle|75mm recoiless rifles]], two [[M2 4.2 inch mortar|4.2 inch mortars]], and four [[M2 mortar|60mm mortars]]. A Battery was armed with only six 105mm [[howitzer]]s.<ref name="Var3"/> These howitzers were armed with 12,000 rounds, but only six of these rounds were [[High Explosive Anti-Tank]] (HEAT) rounds.<ref name="Alex58"/> Most of the soldiers of the Task Force were teenagers with no combat experience and used to the luxuries of life in occupied Japan.<ref>Alexander, p. 53.</ref> Only one third of the officers in the Task Force had combat experience from World War II,<ref name="Alex55"/> and only one in six enlisted soldiers had combat experience.<ref name="Fehr65"/> The soldiers were each equipped with only 120 rounds of ammunition and two days of [[C-ration]]s.<ref name="Fehr65"/>

By July 1, Task Force Smith had fully arrived in South Korea, and briefly established a headquarters in [[Taejon]].<ref>Varhola, p. 84.</ref> Soon after, the task force began moving north by rail and truck to oppose the North Korean army.<ref>Alexander, p. 54.</ref> Task Force Smith was the first of several small U.S. units sent into Korea with the mission to take the initial "shock" of North Korean advances, delaying much larger North Korean units with the goal of buying time to allow more U.S. units into Korea. In the case of Task Force Smith, its mission was to move as far north as possible and begin engaging the North Koreans to stem their advance, so that the rest of the 24th Infantry Division could be moved into South Korea to re-enforce it.<ref>Alexander, p. 52.</ref> The 24th Division commander William F. Dean personally ordered Smith to stop the North Korean force along the highway from Suwon and "as far from Pusan" as possible.<ref name="Alex55"/><ref>Catchpole, p. 13.</ref>

Three days later, on July 4, it dug in on two hills straddling the road north of the village of Osan, {{Convert|6|mi}} south of [[Suwon]] and about {{Convert|25|mi}} south of Seoul.<ref name="Alex55">Alexander, p. 55.</ref><ref>Catchpole, p. 14.</ref> These ridges rose up to {{Convert|300|ft|m}} above the road, providing visibility almost the entire distance to Suwon. The battalion set up a {{Convert|1|mi}} long line over these ridges.<ref name="Fehr65">Fehrenbach, p. 65.</ref> There, they waited to meet the advancing North Korean forces.<ref name="Var3"/> The force was emplaced along the road with the infantry formations on the two hills, with five of the howitzers {{Convert|1|mi}} behind them, and the sixth positioned halfway between the infantry and field artillery positions with the six HEAT rounds.<ref>Alexander, p. 57.</ref>

==Battle==
=== Tank columns ===
At around 0730 on July 5, Task Force Smith spotted a column of eight North Korean T-34 tanks of the [[107th Tank Regiment (North Korea)|107th Tank Regiment]], [[105th Armored Division (North Korea)|North Korean 105th Armored Division]] heading south toward them.<ref name="Ferhxix">Fehrenbach, p. xix.</ref> The North Korean forces, driving south from Seoul, were in pursuit of retreating South Korean forces.<ref>Malkasian, p. 22.</ref> At 0816, the artillery battery fired its first rounds at the advacing North Korean tanks.<ref name="Var3"/> The tanks, which were around {{Convert|2|km|sp=us}} from the infantry force, were hit with numerous 105mm howitzer rounds, but were unaffected. When the tanks closed to {{Convert|700|m|sp=us}}, the 75mm recoiless rifles opened up, scoring direct hits on the lead tanks, but did not damage them. The North Korean tanks, meanwhile, were unable to locate the American weapons and began firing aimlessly from their main cannons and machine guns.<ref name="Alex58"/>

[[File:Char T-34.jpg|thumb|left|alt=A large, heavily armed and armored tank outside a modern-day museum|The T-34 tank was standard armor used by the North Korean Army in 1950 and was also present at Osan]]
Once the tanks reached the infantry line, [[Second Lieutenant]] Ollie Connor fired 22 2.36-inch bazooka rockets at a range of {{convert|15|yd|m}} into the rear of several T-34 tanks, where their armor was thinnest, without effect. Some of the rounds Connor fired did not explode due to age. The North Korean tankers, thinking they were encountering only a small roadblock, ignored the infantry assault and continued on the road to Osan.<ref>Ferhenbach, p. 67.</ref> When the tank column came over the crest of the road, the forward howitzer fired its HEAT rounds, damaging the first two tanks and setting one of them on fire. One of the crew members of the burning tank emerged with a [[PPSh-41|PPSh-41 "burp gun"]] and killed an American in a nearby machine gun nest before being himself killed; causing the first American casualty of the ground combat of the Korean War.<ref name="Fehr68">Fehrenbach, p. 68.</ref> The howitzer, depleted of HEAT rounds, began firing the standard rounds before being destroyed by the third tank. The tanks then advanced to Osan, ignoring the American infantry which continued howizer and bazooka fire on them. The Americans managed to disable only one more North Korean tank by damaging its [[Continuous track|track]]s.<ref name="Alex59">Alexander, p. 59.</ref> The North Korean tanks, in passing, cut the communication wires between the infantry and artillery forces. As he was attempting to get the crew of the disabled tank to surrender, Colonel Perry was wounded in the leg. His artillery force continued pounding at the North Korean tanks to no effect.<ref name="Fehr68"/>

Within an hour, a second wave of 25 T-34s approached the Task Force in small groups. The howitzer battery disabled another tank from this wave and damaged three more, at a cost of 33 killed or wounded and all of its support vehicles destroyed.<ref name="Alex60">Alexander, p. 60.</ref> At this point, several of the men in the artillery battery began deserting their positions, but Perry managed to convince most of them to return.<ref name="Fehr69">Ferhenbach, p. 69.</ref> Although Smith later stated that he believed that the rounds had deteriorated with age, the ineffectiveness of the 2.36-inch bazooka had been demonstrated repeatedly during World War II against German armor.<ref>Green and Green, pp. 38<U+2013>39</ref> Because of peacetime defense cutbacks, the 24th Division had never received improved US M20 3.5-inch bazookas with M28A2 HEAT antitank ammunition, capable of defeating Soviet tanks.<ref name="Blair, Clay 2003">Blair, p. 50.</ref> After the last tanks passed their lines, no North Korean forces were spotted for around an hour.<ref name="Fehr69"/>

=== Infantry column ===

[[File:Battle of Osan Map.JPG|thumb|right|alt=Map of a group of U.S. positions on two hills north of a town, with movements of large Chinese forces moving south and enveloping them|Map of the Battle of Osan]]
At around 1100, three more tanks were sighted advancing from the north. Behind them was a column of trucks {{Convert|6|mi}} long, carrying two full infantry regiments; the [[16th Infantry Regiment (North Korea)|16th Infantry Regiment]] and the [[18th Infantry Regiment (North Korea)|18th Infantry Regiment]] of the [[4th Division (North Korea)|North Korean 4th Infantry Division]], amounting to almost 5,000 troops under the command of Major General Lee Kwon Mu, which were advancing from Seoul.<ref name="Fehr69"/> The column apparently was not in communication with the tanks that had preceded it, and the North Korean infantry was not aware of the Americans' presence.<ref name="Alex60"/>

At 1145, when the column had advanced to {{Convert|1000|yd|m}} Smith gave the order for the task force to open fire with everything it had. The mortar, machine gun, artillery, and rifle fire destroyed several trucks, scattering the column. The three lead tanks moved to within {{Convert|300|m|sp=us}} of Task Force Smith and opened fire. Behind them, around 1,000 of the infantry formed in the rice paddies to the east of the road in an attempt to envelop the American forces, but were repulsed. Smith attempted to order artillery fire on the North Korean force, but runners were unable to get back to the field artillery positions, and so he assumed they had been destroyed by the tanks.<ref name="Fehr70">Fehrenbach, p. 70.</ref> Within 45 minutes, another enveloping force formed to the west of the road, forcing Smith to withdraw a platoon to the east side of the road. Quickly thereafter, the American infantry began taking mortar and artillery fire from the North Koreans.<ref name="Alex61">Alexander, p. 61.</ref>

=== American withdrawal ===
Task Force Smith managed to hold its lines for three hours, but at 1430 Smith ordered the Americans to withdraw, suffering from low ammunition and a breakdown of communications. At this point, North Korean forces were moving on both flanks of the American force and toward the rear of the formation. Smith ordered an orderly withdraw of the force one unit at a time, allowing the rest of the force to cover it as it withdrew. C Company pulled back, followed by the American [[medic]]s, the headquarters, and finally B Company.<ref name="Alex61"/> However, 2nd Platoon, B Company did not receive the withdraw order. When the platoon discovered that it was alone, it was too late for an orderly withdrawal and it could not move its wounded quickly enough. The platoon left most of its equipment in its positions, which was captured by the North Koreans.<ref name="Fehr71">Fehrenbach, p. 71.</ref> Most of the survivors were able to pull out, but the dead and 25 with more serious injuries were left behind to be dealt with by the North Koreans.<ref name="Alex62">Alexander, p. 62.</ref> One North Korean officer later told historian [[John Toland (author)|John Toland]] that the American forces at the battle seemed "too frightened to fight."<ref name="Malk24"/>
[[File:Americanexecuted1950korea.jpg|thumb|left|Soldier of the 21st Infantry Regiment, 24th Division, captured and executed by North Korean forces, 1950|alt=A soldier's body lying on the ground with his hands tied behind his back.]]
The retreat quickly broke down into a confused and disorganized withdrawal. It was during this withdrawal that Task Force Smith suffered its highest casualties, as its soldiers were most exposed to enemy fire during the retreat.<ref>Summers, p. 272.</ref> The surviving members of Task Force Smith reached the artillery battery position, which was intact. The artillerymen disabled the five remaining howitzers by removing their [[Sight (device)|sight]]s and [[breechblock]]s. After this, the entire Task Force moved south on foot to the northern outskirts of Osan, where most of their hidden transport vehicles were intact. The vehicles then departed, picking up stragglers along the way, for [[Pyongtaek]] and [[Cheonan]], where additional units of the 24th Infantry Division had formed the next line of defense. They were not pursued by the North Korean forces.<ref name="Alex62"/>

Before nightfall, 250 of Task Force Smith's force had returned to the American lines, with about 150 more of the force killed, wounded or missing. Over the next several days, most of the other stragglers found their way into the American lines. Five days later, the final stragglers from 2nd Platoon, B Company reached Chonan, only 30 minutes ahead of the North Korean army. Upon the final count, Task Force Smith suffered 20 [[killed in action]], 130 [[wounded in action]] or [[missing in action]], and around 36 captured.<ref name="Alex62"/> Much later, during the Pusan breakout offensive, U.S. troops advancing northward would discover a series of shallow graves containing the bodies of several soldiers of the 24th Infantry Division. All had been shot in the back of the head, their hands still bound behind their backs with communications wire.<ref>Hackworth and Sherman, p. 123.</ref> North Korean casualties were approximately 42 dead and 85 wounded, with four tanks destroyed or immobilized. The North Korean advance was delayed approximately seven hours.<ref name="Fehr71"/><ref name="Var4"/>

==Aftermath==
[[File:Army mil-2008-07-10-213122.jpg|alt=A line of soldiers in white dress uniforms in front of a large monument while another soldier in green stands at a podium beside|thumb|South Korean soldiers in formation in front of the Task Force Smith memorial at Osan]]
The Battle of Osan was the first U.S. ground action of the war.<ref>Summers, p. 18.</ref> Though the force was badly defeated militarily, Task Force Smith accomplished its mission of delaying North Korean forces from advancing for several hours.<ref name="Fehr71"/><ref name="Var4">Varhola, p. 4.</ref><ref>Catchpole, p. 15.</ref> During the battle, the 24th Infantry Division's [[34th Infantry Regiment (United States)|34th Infantry Regiment]] was able to set up in [[Pyeongtaek]], {{convert|15|mi|km}} to the south.<ref>Fehrenbach, p. 72.</ref> Over the next month, the 24th Infantry Division would fight in numerous engagements to delay North Korean forces with similar results. Within a week, the 24th Infantry Division had been pushed back to Taejon where it was again defeated in the [[Battle of Taejon]].<ref name="Malk24"/> The North Koreans, overwhelming U.S. forces time and again, were able to push the Eighth Army all the way back to [[Pusan]], where the [[Battle of the Pusan Perimeter]] would culminate in the eventual defeat of the North Korean Army.<ref>Varhola, p. 289.</ref>

Three months later, on September 19, Osan would be the location where the U.S. and U.N. forces under the command of the Eighth Army, advancing from the south, would meet up with forces of [[X Corps (United States)|X Corps]], advancing from the north after having recently surprised the North Koreans with the [[Inchon Landings]], as the two forces were in the process of an offensive pushing the North Koreans back, which would eventually culminate in a complete defeat of the North Korean Army in the south.<ref>Varhola, p. 10.</ref>

In the years following the Korean War, the U.S. Army used the areas in Japan Task Force Smith trained at as a memorial.<ref name="USAJ"/> A monument to Task Force Smith was established on the battlefield in the years following the Korean War,<ref>Summers, p. 273.</ref> where an annual commemoration of the Battle of Osan is held by the Eighth Army, which is still headquartered in South Korea.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.army.mil/-news/2008/07/10/10801-remembering-task-force-smith/ |title=Remembering Task Force Smith |publisher=[[United States Army]] |accessdate=2009-12-01}}</ref>
