{{Dablink|'''Eilean Glas''' is a common island name on Scotland's west coast. For other islands see [[Eilean Glas|Eilean Glas (disambiguation)]]}}

This particular '''Eilean Glas''' is actually a peninsula of [[Scalpay, Outer Hebrides|Scalpay]] in the [[Outer Hebrides]], [[Scotland]]. Eilean Glas is home to a historic [[lighthouse]]. Eilean Glas means ''Grey/Green Island'' in [[Scottish Gaelic language|Gaelic]].

==Geography==
Eilean Glas lies on the west coast of Scalpay at {{gbmappingsmall|NG247948}}. The island is {{convert|300|m|ft|0}} long and rises no more than {{convert|30|m|ft|0}} above sea level.

The island projects out considerably into [[The Minch]] shipping lane, which is likely why it was decided to place a lighthouse here. A track across the narrow [[isthmus]] connects Eilean Glas to Scalpay. More recently, a [[radio masts and towers|radio mast]] was erected on Eilean Glas.

'''Eilean Glas Lighthouse''' lies in the south at '''Rubh' an E<U+00F2>rna'''. It was one of the original four lights commissioned by the [[Northern Lighthouse Board|Commissioners of the Northern Lights]], and the first in the Hebrides<ref name="nlb"/> (the others were [[Kinnaird Head]], [[Mull of Kintyre]] and [[North Ronaldsay]]). These lighthouses were built by [[Thomas Smith (engineer)|Thomas Smith]].<ref name="nlb"/>

Eilean Glas light was first displayed in 1789. The original tower was replaced in 1824 by Smith's stepson [[Robert Stevenson (civil engineer)|Robert Stevenson]]. In 1852 the light was changed to a revolving system lens. The lighthouse was an early candidate for automation and this was carried out in 1978. Several of the original buildings have been sold off.<ref name="nlb"/>

The {{convert|30|m|ft|0|adj=on}} tower is painted with two distinctive broad red bands. Light is now from [[catoptrics|catoptric]] sealed beam lamps, (similar to car head lights) mounted on a gearless pedestal.<ref name="nlb"/>

In 2004, the owners the lighthouse building were convicted of theft and of running a fraudulent charity to pay for the mortgage on the property.<ref>{{Cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/hampshire/dorset/3674781.stm| title=Couple jailed for lighthouse scam| date=30 April 2004| publisher=[[BBC News]]| accessdate=23 December 2008}}</ref> Their 3&nbsp;year sentence was later reduced to 2&nbsp;years at the Court of Appeal.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/highlands_and_islands/5373260.stm |title=Lighthouse fraud battle continues |date=23 September 2006| publisher=[[BBC News]]| accessdate=27 April 2009}}</ref> The local community of [[Scalpay, Outer Hebrides|Scalpay]] are currently attempting a community buyout.{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}} <!-- A [[restaurant]] that can only be reached on foot is now run from some of the redundant lighthouse outbuildings. -->
