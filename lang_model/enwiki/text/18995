'''All Saints Central High School''' is a [[private school|private]] [[Roman Catholic]] [[high school]] located in [[Bay City, Michigan]], [[United States]].  All Saints has nearly 200 students in the [[2006]]-[[2007]] school year.  Students attend [[mass]] at St. James Church every week and are required to complete 100 [[community service]] hours before they graduate.  

==History==

All Saints had previously been two separate campuses, with juniors and seniors attending classes at the north campus (the current main building), and underclassmen attending classes at the south campus across the street from St. Stanislaus Church, on the corner of South Van Buren and Kosciuszko.  Some classes were held for underclassmen at the north campus, and students were allowed to leave class ten minutes early to make the trek to the other campus.  The school was consolidated to a single campus in 1985.
