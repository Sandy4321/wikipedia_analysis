'''St. Helen's''' is the [[Church of England|Anglican]] [[parish church]] of [[Ashby-de-la-Zouch]], in the [[deanery]] of [[North West Leicestershire]] and the [[Diocese of Leicester]]. 
==History==
===Foundation to 1547===
St Helen's is the [[parish church]] of the English market town of [[Ashby-de-la-Zouch]] in [[Leicestershire]]. The parish is in the deanery of North West Leicestershire, the Diocese of Leicester and the [[Province of Canterbury]].<ref name = CE>{{cite web| author = | title= St. Helen's, Ashby de la Zouch| work= A church near you | url= http://www.achurchnearyou.com/sthelensashby/| publisher= Church of England }} Retrieved 21 October 2014</ref> St Helen's is a nationally important building, with a [[Listed building#Categories of listed building|Grade I listing]] for its exceptional architectural interest.<ref name=BLB>{{cite web|title=Parish Church of St Helen, Ashby-de-la-Zouch|url=http://www.britishlistedbuildings.co.uk/en-187627-parish-church-of-st-helen-ashby-de-la-zo|work=British Listed Buildings|accessdate=21 October 2014}}</ref>

There is little documented history of the town before the [[Norman conquest of England|Norman Conquest]], although [[Roman Britain|Roman]] coins were found in the area, and the town's name has both Saxon and Danish elements. It has a an entry in the [[Domesday Book]] which suggests that it then had about 100 inhabitants, and subsequently grew in importance under its La Zouch and Hastings lords, notably [[William Hastings, 1st Baron Hastings|William Hastings]].<ref name= Scott0108> Scott (1907) pp. 1<U+2013>8.</ref><ref name= Hillier1215> Hillier (1984) pp. 12<U+2013>15.</ref>

Domesday records that a priest was resident in Ashby, and that the church dedicated to [[Helena (empress)|St Helen]] consisted only of a [[nave]]. In about 1144, Philip Beaumais, lord of the Manor of Ashby, granted the church, its lands and revenues to the [[Augustinians|Augustinian]] community of [[Lilleshall Abbey]], which retained possession until 1538.<ref name= Williams4> Williams (1980) pp. 4<U+2013>5.</ref><ref name= Scott307> Scott (1907) pp. 307<U+2013>308.</ref> Parts of the [[nave]] and [[chancel]] date from the fourteenth century,<ref name=BLB/> but the church was rebuilt and enlarged in by William Hastings in 1474, at the same time that he erected the tower of his nearby [[Ashby de la Zouch Castle|castle]].<ref name= Williams4/> The new, larger church included a nave with tower and [[aisle]]s, and chapels adjoining the chancel.<ref name=BLB/>
===Reformation and after===

The [[English Reformation]] inevitably affected St Helen's. [[Edward VI of England|Edward VI's]] 1547 injunction decreed that all images in churches were to be dismantled or destroyed, including [[stained glass]], [[shrines]], [[rood]]s, statues and bells,<ref name= haigh>Haigh (1987) pp. 119<U+2013>121</ref> and [[altar]]s were to be dismantled and replaced by wooden tables.<ref name= nye>Nye (1965) p. 71</ref>
The tower, Hastings Chapel, [[buttress]]es and windows still remain from the fifteenth century works.<ref name= Scott307/> Damage during the [[English Civil War]] of 1642<U+2013>49 was minimal, although there are [[Pike (weapon)|pike]] marks on the stonework.<ref name= Williams4/> The church may have been fortified as part of the defences of the castle, a Royalist stronghold.<ref name= Hilliercivwar> Hillier (2010) p. 13.</ref>

Around 1670, the church was refurbished, a gallery was built at the western end of the nave, and church acquired the carved [[reredos]] and the large wooden [[ Royal Arms of England|Royal coat of arms]]. The increasing congregation led to the replacement of the [[pew]]s and the construction of galleries down both sides of the building in 1829,<ref name= Hillier23> Hillier (1984) pp. 22<U+2013>23.</ref> but a more extensive rebuilding was undertaken in 1878-80, by [[James Piers St Aubyn]]. The two outer aisles were added during this period, along with the removal of the galleries, conversion of a chapel to a [[vestry]] and improvements to the Hastings Chapel.The cost of these works has been estimated as between <U+00A3>16,000 and more than <U+00A3>18,000.<ref name=BLB>{{cite web|title=Parish Church of St Helen, Ashby-de-la-Zouch|url=http://www.britishlistedbuildings.co.uk/en-187627-parish-church-of-st-helen-ashby-de-la-zo|work=British Listed Buildings|accessdate=6 August 2013}}</ref><ref name= Hillier23/> Later developments included the expenditure of <U+00A3>13,000 between 1963 and 1968 to combat [[deathwatch beetle]] found during rewiring, improvements to the heating system, and a rededication in 1974, the quincentenary of the church.<ref name= Hillier23/>

==Description==
[[File:The nave, St Helen's Church, Ashby-de-la-Zouch.jpg|thumb|left|The nave and chancel]]

One notable feature of the church is the [[finger pillory]] which was an alternative punishment to the stocks formerly used to punish people.

St Helen's was designated as a [[Listed building#Categories of listed building|Grade I listed building]] in 1950, which recognizes it as a building of exceptional interest.

==People==
{{Main|List of vicars of St Helen's, Ashby-de-la-Zouch}}
The living at St Helen's was in the gift of Lilleshall Abbey until 1508, when it passed to the [[Bishop of Coventry|Bishop of Coventry and Lichfield]]. The [[Dissolution of the Monasteries]] led to the transfer of the patronage to [[Francis Hastings, 2nd Earl of Huntingdon]], and remained with the Hastings family until 1931, passing then to a John G. Shields and his descendants.<ref name= Williams19> Williams (1980) pp. 19<U+2013>20.</ref> 

The first known vicar of St Helen's was Roger in 1200. [[Henry Hastings, 3rd Earl of Huntingdon]] was a zealous promoter of [[puritan|puritanism]] and founded Ashby Grammar School to provide education in accordance with his religious views. From about 1562 to 1632 Ashby had a succession of Puritan ministers, from [[Anthony Gilby]] to [[Arthur Hildersham]]. Gilbey was nationally influential, and Hildersham, barred from preaching or deprived of his living for 17 of the 38 years of his incumbency,<ref name= Hillier23/> also sought to internationalise radical protestantism.<ref name= Braddick > Braddick (2009) p. 75.</ref>      

[[Mark James Monk]], organist from 1880<U+2013>1883, fulfilled the same role from 1890 at [[Truro Cathedral]].<ref name=West> West (1899) p. 82.</ref><ref>{{Cite news | last1 = | first1 = | title = Obituary | journal = [[The Musical Times]] | volume = 70 | issue = 1036 | page = 559 | location = London| publisher = Musical Times Publications|date = 1 June 1929 | url = http://www.jstor.org/pss/915039 |jstor=915039 | doi = }}</ref>
