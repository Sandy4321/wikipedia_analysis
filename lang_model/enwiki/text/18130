'''Edward the Martyr''' ([[Old English]]: ''Eadweard'') (c. 962 <U+2013> 18 March 978) was [[king of England|king of the English]] from 975 until he was murdered in 978. Edward was the eldest son of King [[Edgar]], but not his father's acknowledged [[heir apparent|heir]]. On Edgar's death, the leadership of England was contested, with some supporting Edward's claim to be king and other supporting his much younger half-brother [[<U+00C6>thelred the Unready]]. Edward was chosen as king and was crowned by his main clerical supporters, Archbishops [[Dunstan]] and [[Oswald of Worcester]].

Edward's reign began inauspiciously when a [[comet]] was sighted. A famine followed. The great nobles of the kingdom, [[Ealdorman|ealdormen]] [[<U+00C6>lfhere, Ealdorman of Mercia|<U+00C6>lfhere]] and [[<U+00C6>thelwine, Ealdorman of East Anglia|<U+00C6>thelwine]] quarreled and civil war almost broke out. In the so-called anti-monastic reaction the nobles took advantage of Edward's weakness to dispossess the [[Benedictine]] reformed monasteries of lands and other properties which King Edgar had granted to them. Edward's short reign was brought to an end by his murder at [[Corfe Castle]] in circumstances which are not altogether clear.

Edward's body was reburied with great ceremony at [[Shaftesbury Abbey]] early in 980. In 1001 his remains were moved to a more prominent place in the abbey, probably with the blessing of his half-brother King <U+00C6>thelred. Edward was already reckoned a saint by this time. A number of [[hagiography|lives]] of Edward were written in the centuries following his death in which he was portrayed as a [[martyr]], generally seen as a victim of his stepmother Queen Dowager [[<U+00C6>lfthryth, Queen of England|<U+00C6>lfthryth]]. He is today recognized as a saint in the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]], the [[Roman Catholic Church]], and the [[Anglican Communion]].

==<U+00C6>theling==
His date of birth is unknown, but it is likely that he was a teenager when he succeeded his father in 975, and was the eldest of Edgar's three children.<ref name=Higham7>Higham, ''Death of Anglo-Saxon England'', p. 7.</ref> All that can be said with certainty of Edward's parentage is that he was King Edgar's son, but not the son of Queen <U+00C6>lfthryth. This much and no more is known from contemporary [[charters]].<ref>Hart, "Edward", p. 783; Williams, ''<U+00C6>thelred the Unready'', p. 2.</ref>

For further information on Edward's mother it is necessary to rely on later sources of questionable reliability. The earliest such source is a life of [[Dunstan]] by [[Osbern of Canterbury]], probably written in the 1080s. Osbern writes that Edward's mother was a nun at [[Wilton Abbey]] whom the king seduced.<ref>Hart, "Edward", p. 783; Williams, ''<U+00C6>thelred the Unready'', p. 3.</ref> When [[Eadmer]] wrote a life of Dunstan some decades later, he included an account of Edward's parentage obtained from [[Nicholas of Worcester]]. This denied that Edward was the son of a liaison between Edgar and a nun, and instead presented him the son of one <U+00C6>thelfl<U+00E6>d, daughter of Ordm<U+00E6>r, "ealdorman of the East Anglians", whom Edgar had married in the years when he ruled [[Mercia]], that is between 957 and [[Eadwig]]'s death in 959.<ref>Williams, ''<U+00C6>thelred the Unready'', pp. 3<U+2013>4.</ref> Yet further accounts are offered by [[Goscelin]] in his life of Edgar's daughter Saint [[Edith of Wilton]], and in the histories of [[John of Worcester]] and [[William of Malmesbury]].<ref>Hart, "Edward", p. 783; Williams, ''<U+00C6>thelred the Unready'', pp. 4<U+2013>5.</ref> Summarising these various accounts Edward's mother probably was a noblewoman named <U+00C6>thelfl<U+00E6>d, surnamed ''Candida'' or ''Eneda''<U+2014>"the White" or "White Duck".<ref name=Higham6>Higham, ''Death of Anglo-Saxon England'', p. 6.</ref>

A charter of 966 describes <U+00C6>lfthryth, whom Edgar had married in 964, as the king's "lawful wife", and their son Edmund as legitimate son of the king. Edward is merely the king's son.<ref>Williams, ''<U+00C6>thelred the Unready'', p. 2; John, ''Reassessing Anglo-Saxon England'', p. 120. However, a genealogy created at [[Glastonbury Abbey]] circa 969 gives Edward precedence over Edmund and <U+00C6>thelred; Williams, ''<U+00C6>thelred the Unready'', p. 8. <U+00C6>lfthryth was the widow of [[<U+00C6>thelwald, Ealdorman of East Anglia]] and perhaps Edgar's third wife; Stafford, ''Unification and Conquest'', pp. 52 & 57.</ref> The contradictions regarding who Edward's mother was, and the fact that Edmund appears to have been regarded as the legitimate heir until his death in 971, suggests that Edward was probably illegitimate.<ref>{{citation |last=Hart |first=Cyril |contribution= Edward the Martyr |title=Oxford Dictionary of National Biography |location=Oxford |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2007 |url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/8515 |accessdate=9 November 2008 }}</ref>

==Disputed succession==
Edmund's brother <U+00C6>thelred may have inherited his position as favoured [[heir apparent|heir]].<ref>Miller, "Edward the Martyr"; Higham, ''Death of Anglo-Saxon England'', p. 7. Williams, ''<U+00C6>thelred the Unready'', p. 8, dissents from this view.</ref> Edgar's intentions may have been signalled by the fact that on a charter to the [[New Minster, Winchester|New Minster]] at [[Winchester]], the names of <U+00C6>lfthryth and her son <U+00C6>thelred appear ahead of Edward's name.<ref name=Higham7/> Edgar's actual plans for the succession can only be conjecture as he died, still a young man aged about 32, on 8 July 975, leaving two sons, neither yet an adult.<ref name="miller">Miller, "Edward the Martyr".</ref>

Edgar had been a strong ruler who had forced monastic reforms on a probably unwilling church and nobility, aided by the leading clerics of the day, [[Dunstan]], [[Archbishop of Canterbury]], [[Oswald of Worcester]], [[Archbishop of York]], and Bishop [[<U+00C6>thelwold of Winchester]]. The endowment of the reformed [[Benedictine]] monasteries with the lands required for their support had seen many lesser nobles dispossessed outright and leases and loans of land rewritten to the benefit of the monasteries. Secular clergy, many of whom will have been members of the nobility, had been expelled from the new monasteries. While Edgar lived, he strongly supported the reformers, but following his death the discontents which these changes had provoked came into the open.<ref>John, ''Reassessing Anglo-Saxon England'', pp. 113<U+2013>9; Hart, "Edward", pp. 783<U+2013>4; Miller, "Edgar"; Higham, ''Death of Anglo-Saxon England'', pp. 2<U+2013>4; Fisher, "Anti-Monastic Reaction", pp. 254<U+2013>245 & 266.</ref>

The leading figures had all been supporters of the reform, but they were no longer united. Relations between Archbishop Dunstan and Bishop <U+00C6>thelwold may have been strained.<ref>Hart, "Edward", 784.</ref> Archbishop Oswald was at odds with Ealdorman [[<U+00C6>lfhere, Ealdorman of Mercia]],<ref>Higham, ''Death of Anglo-Saxon England'', p. 9; Williams, "<U+00C6>lfhere".</ref> while <U+00C6>lfhere and his kin were rivals for power with the affinity of [[<U+00C6>thelwine, Ealdorman of East Anglia]].<ref>Higham, ''Death of Anglo-Saxon England'', pp. 4<U+2013>5 & 9; Hart, "<U+00C6>thelwine" .</ref> It is said that Dunstan questioned Edgar's marriage with Queen Dowager <U+00C6>lfthryth and the legitimacy of their son <U+00C6>thelred.<ref>Higham, ''Death of Anglo-Saxon England'', pp. 7 & 8.</ref>

These leaders were divided as to whether Edward or <U+00C6>thelred should succeed Edgar. Neither law nor precedent offered much guidance. The choice between the sons of [[Edward the Elder]] had divided his kingdom, and Edgar's elder brother [[Eadwig]] had been forced to give over a large part of the kingdom to Edgar.<ref>Higham, ''Death of Anglo-Saxon England'', p. 9<U+2013>12.</ref> It is certain that the Queen Dowager supported the claims of <U+00C6>thelred, her son, aided by Bishop <U+00C6>thelwold, and that Dunstan supported Edward, aided by his fellow archbishop Oswald. It is likely that Ealdorman <U+00C6>lfhere and his allies supported <U+00C6>thelred and that <U+00C6>thelwine and his allies supported Edward, although some historians suggest the opposite.<ref>While Higham, Miller and Williams suggest that <U+00C6>lfhere supported <U+00C6>thelred, Hart makes <U+00C6>thelwine and his party the supporters of <U+00C6>thelred.</ref>

The arguments employed by the factions are largely unknown, although later sources suggest that perceptions of legitimacy played a part, as did the relative age of the two candidates. In time, Edward was anointed by Archbishops Dunstan and Oswald at [[Kingston upon Thames]], most likely in 975.<ref>Williams, ''<U+00C6>thelred the Unready'', p. 10; Miller, "Edward the Martyr". Dales, ''Dunstan'', p. 100, suggests that the inauguration may have taken place in March 976.</ref> There is evidence that the settlement involved a degree of compromise. <U+00C6>thelred appears to have been given lands which normally belonged to the king's sons, some of which had been granted by Edgar to [[Abingdon Abbey]] and which were now forcibly repossessed for <U+00C6>thelred by the leading nobles.<ref>Williams, ''<U+00C6>thelred the Unready'', p. 10; this seizure is recorded in charter [http://www.anglo-saxons.net/hwaet/?do=get&type=charter&id=937 S 937].</ref>

==Edward's reign==
The ''[[Anglo-Saxon Chronicle]]'', after recording Edward's succession, reports that a [[comet]] appeared and that famine and "manifold disturbances" followed.<ref>Swanton, ''Anglo-Saxon Chronicle'', p. 121, Ms. D & E, s.a. 975 & p. 122, Ms. C, s.a. 976.</ref> The "manifold disturbances", sometimes called the anti-monastic reaction, appear to have started soon after Edgar's death. During this time the experienced Ealdorman Oslac of Northumbria, effective ruler of much of northern England, was exiled in circumstances which are unknown.<ref>Williams, ''<U+00C6>thelred the Unready'', p. 11; Higham, ''Death of Anglo-Saxon England'', p. 10; Fisher, "Anti-Monastic Reaction", p. 268; Dales, ''Dunstan'', p. 100; Swanton, ''Anglo-Saxon Chronicle'', p. 121, Ms. D, s.a. 975.</ref> Oslac was followed as ealdorman by one Thored, either Oslac's son of that name or the Thored Gunnar's son mentioned by the ''Chronicle'' in 966.<ref>Williams, ''<U+00C6>thelred the Unready'', p. 24; Swanton, ''Anglo-Saxon Chronicle'', p. 119, Ms. E, s.a. 966.</ref> Edward, or rather those who were wielding power on his behalf, also appointed a number of new ealdormen to positions in [[Wessex]]. Little is known of two of these men, and it is difficult to determine which faction, if any, they belonged to. Edwin, probably ruling in [[Sussex]], and perhaps also parts of [[Kent]] and [[Surrey]], was buried at Abingdon, an abbey patronised by <U+00C6>lfhere. <U+00C6>thelm<U+00E6>r, who oversaw [[Hampshire]], held lands in [[Rutland]], perhaps suggesting links to <U+00C6>thelwine. The third ealdorman, [[<U+00C6>thelweard (historian)|<U+00C6>thelweard]], today best known for his [[Latin]] history, ruled in the west. <U+00C6>thelweard was a descendant of King [[<U+00C6>thelred of Wessex]] and probably the brother of King Eadwig's wife. He appears to have been a supporter of Edward rather than of either faction.<ref>Higham, ''Death of Anglo-Saxon England'', pp. 11<U+2013>12; Williams, ''<U+00C6>thelred the Unready'', pp. 9<U+2013>10, 17 & 22.</ref>

[[Image:EdwardMartyr.gif|thumb|A penny minted during Edward's reign at [[Stamford, Lincolnshire]], one of the [[Five Burghs]]]]
It appears that in some places the secular clergy who had been driven from the monasteries returned, driving the regular clergy out in their turn. Bishop <U+00C6>thelwold had been the main enemy of the seculars, and Archbishop Dunstan appears to have done little to aid his fellow reformer at this time.<ref>Hart, "Edward", p. 784.</ref> More generally, the magnates took the opportunity to undo many of Edgar's grants to monasteries and to force the abbots to rewrite leases and loans to favour the local nobility. Ealdorman <U+00C6>lfhere was the leader in this regard, attacking Oswald's network of monasteries across Mercia.<ref>Williams, "<U+00C6>lfhere". <U+00C6>lfhere was remembered as a generous patron and protector of the reformed [[Glastonbury Abbey]].</ref> <U+00C6>lfhere's rival <U+00C6>thelwine, while a staunch protector of his family monastery of [[Ramsey Abbey]], treated [[Ely Abbey]] and other monasteries harshly.<ref>Fisher, "Anti-Monastic Reaction", pp. 266<U+2013>267; Hart, "<U+00C6>thelwine". Dales, ''Dunstan'', p. 101.</ref> At some point during these disorders <U+00C6>lfhere and <U+00C6>thelwine appear to have come close to open warfare. This may well have been related to <U+00C6>lfhere's ambitions in East Anglia and to attacks upon Ramsey Abbey. <U+00C6>thelwine, supported by his kinsman Ealdorman [[Byrhtnoth]] of Essex and others unspecified, mustered an army and caused <U+00C6>lfhere to back down.<ref>Williams, ''<U+00C6>thelred the Unready'', pp. 10<U+2013>11.</ref>

Very few [[charter]]s survive from Edward's reign, perhaps as few as three, and the absence of a sizable body of charters such as are found in the reign of Edgar and <U+00C6>thelred leave much of Edward's reign in obscurity. All of the surviving charters concern the royal heartland of [[Wessex]], two dealing with [[Crediton]] where Edward's former tutor [[Sideman (bishop)|Sideman]] was [[Bishop of Crediton|bishop]].<ref>Williams, ''<U+00C6>thelred the Unready'', p. 11; Hart, "Edward", p. 784; Swanton, ''Anglo-Saxon Chronicle'', p. 122, Ms. C, s.a. 977.</ref> Whereas during Edgar's reign dies for coins were cut only at [[Winchester]] and distributed from there to other mints across the kingdom, during Edward's reign this system no longer prevailed. Dies were now cut locally at [[York]] and at [[Lincoln, Lincolnshire|Lincoln]]. The general impression is of a reduction or breakdown of royal authority in the midlands and north.<ref>Hart, "Edward", p. 784; Higham, ''Death of Anglo-Saxon England'', pp. 11 & 13.</ref> Nonetheless, the machinery of government evidently continued to function as councils and synods continued to meet during Edward's reign, at [[Kirtlington]] in [[Oxfordshire]] after Easter 977, and again at [[Calne]] in [[Wiltshire]] the following year. The meeting at Calne saw the death and injury of some councillors when the floor of the room in which they were meeting collapsed.<ref>Swanton, ''Anglo-Saxon Chronicle'', p. 122, Ms. E, s.a. 977 & p. 123, Ms. C, s.a. 978; Dales, ''Dunstan'', p. 102; Hart, "<U+00C6>thelwine"; Higham, ''Death of Anglo-Saxon England'', p. 13.</ref>

==Death==
[[File:A Chronicle of England - Page 072 - Edward Murdered at Corfe.jpg|thumb|right|In the 19th Century depiction by [[James William Edmund Doyle]], Edward the Martyr is offered a cup of mead by <U+00C6>lfthryth, wife of Edgar, unaware that her attendant is about to murder him.]]
The version of ''Anglo-Saxon Chronicle'' which contains the most detailed account records that Edward was murdered, probably at or near the mound on which the ruins of [[Corfe Castle]] now stand, in the evening of 18 March 978, while visiting <U+00C6>lfthryth and <U+00C6>thelred. It adds that he was buried at [[Wareham, Dorset|Wareham]] "without any royal honours". The compiler of this version of the ''Chronicle'', manuscript E, called the [[Peterborough]] Chronicle, says:
[[Image:Corfe Castle2.jpg|thumb|left|Corfe Castle from below]]
<blockquote>"No worse deed for the English race was done than this was, since they first sought out the land of Britain. Men murdered him, but God exalted him. In life he was an earthly king; after death he is now a heavenly saint. His earthly relatives would not avenge him, but his Heavenly Father has much avenged him."<ref>Swanton, ''Anglo-Saxon Chronicle'', p. 123, Ms. E, s.a. 979, also in Ms. D; Williams, ''<U+00C6>thelred the Unready'', p. 11; Higham, ''Death of Anglo-Saxon England'', pp. 17<U+2013>18.</ref></blockquote> Other recensions of the ''Chronicle'' report even less detail, the oldest text stating only that he was killed, while versions from the 1040s say that he was martyred.<ref>Swanton, ''Anglo-Saxon Chronicle'', p. 121. Ms. A, s.a. 978 & Ms. C, s.a. 978.</ref>

Of other early sources, the life of Oswald of Worcester attributed to [[Byrhtferth]] of Ramsey adds that Edward was killed by <U+00C6>thelred's advisers who attacked him when he was dismounting. It agrees that he was buried without ceremony at Wareham.<ref>Williams, ''<U+00C6>thelred the Unready'', pp. 11<U+2013>12; Hart, "Edward", pp. 784<U+2013>785; Miller, "Edward the Martyr".</ref> Archbishop [[Wulfstan II]] alludes to the killing of Edward in his ''[[Sermo Lupi ad Anglos]]'', written not later than 1016. A recent study translates his words as follows:<blockquote>"And a very great betrayal of a lord it is also in the world, that a man betray his lord to death, or drive him living from the land, and both have come to pass in this land: Edward was betrayed, and then killed, and after that burned ..."<ref>Melissa Bernstein Ser's translation in her [http://english3.fsu.edu/~wulfstan/ Electronic Sermo Lupi ad Anglos].</ref></blockquote> Later sources, further removed from events, such as the late 11th century ''Passio S. Eadwardi'' and [[John of Worcester]], claim that <U+00C6>lfthryth organised the killing of Edward, while [[Henry of Huntingdon]] has her kill Edward herself.<ref>Williams, ''<U+00C6>thelred the Unready'', pp. 12<U+2013>13; Miller, "Edward the Martyr"; Dales, ''Dunstan'', p. 103.</ref>

[[Image:death of edward martyr.jpg|thumb|right|<U+00C6>lfthryth looks on as Edward is stabbed to death: from a Victorian edition of [[John Foxe|Foxe's]] ''[[Book of Martyrs]]'']]
Modern historians have offered a variety of interpretations of Edward's killing. Three main theories have been proposed. Firstly, that Edward was killed, as the life of Oswald claims, by nobles in <U+00C6>thelred's service, either as a result of a personal quarrel, or to place their master on the throne.<ref>So, for example, Williams, ''<U+00C6>thelred the Unready'', p. 12; Dales, ''Dunstan'', p. 103.</ref> Although it may be a [[Trope (literature)|trope]] of [[hagiography]], the life of Oswald portrays Edward as an unstable young man who, according to [[Frank Stenton]]: "had offended many important persons by his intolerable violence of speech and behavior. Long after he had passed into veneration as a saint it was remembered that his outbursts of rage had alarmed all who knew him, and especially the members of his own household."<ref name="Stenton">Stenton, ''Anglo-Saxon England'', p. 372; as a trope, see Williams, ''<U+00C6>thelred the Unready'', pp. 8<U+2013>9.</ref>

The second case is much the same as the first, except that <U+00C6>lfthryth would be in some manner implicated, either beforehand by plotting the killing, or afterwards in allowing the killers to go free and unpunished.<ref>Thus Hart, "Edward", p. 785; Higham, ''Death of Anglo-Saxon England'', p. 14.</ref> A third alternative, noting that Edward in 978 was very close to ruling on his own, proposes that Ealdorman <U+00C6>lfhere was behind the killing so as to preserve his own influence and to prevent Edward taking revenge for his actions earlier in the reign.<ref>For this, see Higham, ''Death of Anglo-Saxon England'', p. 12; John, ''Reassessing Anglo-Saxon England'', pp. 119<U+2013>121 notes this and sees <U+00C6>lfhere's part in Edward's reburial as being a penance for the killing.</ref>

==Reburial and early cult==
Edward's body lay at Wareham for a year before being disinterred. This was initiated by <U+00C6>lfhere, perhaps as a gesture of reconciliation. According to the life of Oswald, Edward's body was found to be [[incorrupt]] when it was disinterred. The body was taken to the [[Shaftesbury Abbey]], a nunnery with royal connections which had been endowed by King [[Alfred the Great]] and where Edward and <U+00C6>thelred's grandmother [[<U+00C6>lfgifu of Shaftesbury|<U+00C6>lfgifu]] had spent her latter years. Edward's remains were reburied with lavish public ceremony. Later accounts, such as the ''Passio S. Eadwardi'' have more complicated accounts, including the concealment of Edward's body in a marsh, where it was revealed by miraculous events. The ''Passio'' dates the reburial to 18 February.<ref>Stafford, ''Unification and Conquest'', p. 59; Ridyard, ''Royal Saints'', pp. 155<U+2013>156; Hart, "Edward", p. 785; Williams, ''<U+00C6>thelred the Unready'', p. 16; Miller, "Edward the Martyr". It is possible that the ''Passio S. Eadwardi'' is based in part on an earlier life compiled at Shaftesbury.</ref>

[[Image:Shaftesbury Abbey.jpg|thumb|left|The Great Seal of Shaftesbury Abbey, where Edward's relics lay until the [[English Reformation]]]]
In 1001, Edward's relics, for by now he was reckoned a saint, were [[translation (relics)|translated]] to a more prominent place within the nunnery at Shaftesbury. The ceremonies are said to have been led by the then-[[Bishop of Sherborne (historic)|Bishop of Sherborne]], [[Wulfsige III]], accompanied by a senior cleric whom the ''Passio'' calls Elsinus, sometimes identified with <U+00C6>lfsige, the abbot of the [[New Minster, Winchester]]. King <U+00C6>thelred, preoccupied with the threat of a Danish invasion, did not attend in person, but he issued a charter to the Shaftesbury nuns late in 1001 granting them lands at [[Bradford on Avon]] which is thought to be related. A 13th century [[calendar of saints]] gives the date of this translation as 20 June.<ref>Williams, ''<U+00C6>thelred the Unready'', pp. 15<U+2013>16; Ridyard, ''Royal Saints'', pp. 156<U+2013>157. <U+00C6>thelred's charter is [http://www.anglo-saxons.net/hwaet/?do=get&type=charter&id=899 S 899].</ref>

The rise of Edward's cult has been interpreted in various ways. It is sometimes portrayed as a purely popular movement, or as the product of a political attack on King <U+00C6>thelred by former supporters of Edward. Alternatively, <U+00C6>thelred has been seen as one of the key forces in the promotion of Edward's cult and that of their sister [[Edith of Wilton|Eadgifu]]. As well as the charter granting land to Shaftesbury at the elevation of Edward's relics in 1001, it has been suggested that <U+00C6>thelred legislated the observation of Edward's feast days across England in a law code of 1008. It is, however, not quite certain that this innovation, seemingly drafted by Archbishop Wulfstan II, dates from <U+00C6>thelred's reign, and it may instead have been promulgated by King [[Cnut the Great|Cnut]]. David Rollason has drawn attention to the increased importance of the cults of other murdered royal saints in this period. Among these are the cults of King [[Ecgberht of Kent]]'s nephews whose lives form part of the [[Mildrith]] Legend, and those of the [[Mercia]]n Saints [[Kenelm]] and [[Wigstan]].<ref>Williams, ''<U+00C6>thelred the Unready'', pp. 14<U+2013>17; Rollason, ''Mildrith Legend'', pp. 53<U+2013>57; Hart, "Edward", p. 785; Miller, "Edward the Martyr"; Ridyard, ''Royal Saints'', pp. 154<U+2013>175.</ref>

==Later cult==
[[Image:Edward the Martyr.jpg|thumb|right|Orthodox icon of St Edward the Martyr]]
During the sixteenth century, under [[Henry VIII of England|King Henry VIII]], the [[dissolution of the monasteries|monasteries were dissolved]] and many holy places were demolished, but Edward's remains were hidden so as to avoid [[desecration]].<ref name="life">{{Citation  | last =Serfes
