'''Norman Witchell Biggs'''<ref>Biggs is often incorrectly named Norman Mitchell Biggs in publications, including the [[Alumni Cantabrigienses]]</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.freebmd.org.uk/cgi/information.pl?cite=%2BjENZGX1tuwQzX0WElwyWw&scan=1|title=Index entry|accessdate=27 August 2010|work=FreeBMD|publisher=ONS}}</ref> (3 November 1870 <U+2013> 27 February 1908) was a [[Wales|Welsh]] international [[rugby union]] wing who played club rugby for [[Cardiff RFC|Cardiff]] and county rugby for [[Glamorgan County RFC|Glamorgan]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wru.co.uk/14256.php?player=25816&includeref=dynamic |title=Wales Player archive - Norman Biggs|author= |publisher=Welsh Rugby Union |date= |accessdate=27 August 2010}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.scrum.com/wales/rugby/player/840.html|title=Norman Biggs |accessdate=27 August 2010|work=Scrum.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.genuki.org.uk/big/wal/GLA/Newsitems.html |title=Newspaper Extracts from Genuki.org.uk|author= |publisher=[[Western Mail (Wales)|Western Mail]] |date=4 April 1894 |accessdate=27 August 2010}}</ref> Both Biggs and his brother [[Selwyn Biggs|Selwyn]] played international rugby for [[Wales national rugby union team|Wales]], though they never played together in the same match for Wales.

Biggs is most notable for being a member of the 1893 [[Triple Crown (rugby union)|Triple Crown]] winning Wales team, being the youngest [[Cap (sport)|capped]] player to represent the Wales international team and the unusual circumstances of his death by [[Arrow poison|poison arrow]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/rugby_union/welsh/8466743.stm | title=Tom Prydie could become Wales' youngest cap| work=BBC Sport | author= | date=19 January 2010 | accessdate=19 January 2010}}</ref><ref name="NLoW">{{cite web|url=http://yba.llgc.org.uk/en/s-BIGG-NOR-1870.html |title=Biography of Norman Biggs|author=Williams, Moelwyn Idwal |publisher=National Library of Wales|date= |accessdate=27 August 2010}}</ref>

==Early history==
Norman Biggs was born in [[Cardiff]] to John and Emily Biggs.<ref name="Census">{{cite web|url=http://www.familysearch.org/eng/search/frameset_search.asp?PAGE=/eng/search/ancestorsearchresults.asp |title=Household information of 27 Park Place, Cardiff.|author=1881 British Census |publisher=family Search.org|date=1881 |accessdate=1 September 2010}}</ref> His father, who lived at Park Place in the centre of the city, was a brewer by trade who owned businesses in Cardiff and Bristol.<ref name="Census"/> Biggs was privately educated at several [[proprietary schools]] including Lewinsdale School in [[Weston-super-Mare]], before matriculating to [[Cardiff University|University College Cardiff]] and later [[Trinity Hall, Cambridge]], playing rugby for both university teams.<ref name="Jenkins21">Jenkins (1991), pg 21.</ref><ref>{{Venn|id=BGS889NM|name=Biggs, Norman Mitchell}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.familysearch.org/eng/search/frameset_search.asp?PAGE=/eng/search/ancestorsearchresults.asp |title=Household information for 'Lewinsdale School', 1 Ellenborough Park.|author=1881 British Census |publisher=family Search.org|date=1881 |accessdate=1 September 2010}}</ref> On returning to Cardiff he joined his father's brewing business.<ref name="NLoW"/><ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.wru.co.uk/23456.php | title=Prydie joins illustrious band of brothers| work=WRU | author= | date=17 March 2010 | accessdate=27 August 2010}}</ref> In 1887, Biggs played his first senior game for Cardiff RFC, in a match against [[Penarth RFC|Penarth]]. Biggs came from a large sporting family and was one of six brothers to play rugby for Cardiff. His most notable brothers were Selwyn, who also played for Wales, and [[Cecil Biggs|Cecil]], who captained Cardiff during their 1904/05 season.<ref name="Jenkins21"/>

==Rugby career==
===International debut===
Biggs gained his first [[Cap (sport)|cap]] for Wales when he was selected to play against the touring [[1888-1889 New Zealand Native football team|New Zealand Natives]] in 1888 at [[St. Helen's Rugby and Cricket Ground|St. Helen's Ground]]. At the time Biggs was 18 years and 49 days old, making him the youngest Wales international, a record that would last for more than a century before being broken by [[Tom Prydie]] in [[2010 Six Nations Championship#Week 5|2010]].<ref name="Griffiths4:5">Griffiths (1987), p. 4:5.</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rbs6nations.com/en/matchcentre/16424.php |title=Hook crosses twice in Wales romp over Italy |author=Sportsbeat |publisher=''RBS6Nations.com'' |date=20 March 2010 |accessdate=22 March 2010}}</ref> The New Zealanders were the first touring team from the Southern Hemisphere and brought with them a reputation for over-vigorous play.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nzhistory.net.nz/culture/nz-natives-rugby-tour/unsporting-behaviour |title=Unsporting behaviour? - NZ Natives' rugby tour of 1888/89 |author= |publisher=New Zealand History online |date= |accessdate=27 August 2010}}</ref> Biggs himself was described by the press as "palpably nervous" before the kick-off, though many of the backs appeared withdrawn, apart from [[William Stadden]] and [[James Webb (rugby player)|James Webb]] appearing calm.<ref name="Billot17">Billot (1972), pg 17.</ref> Not only did Biggs have the M<U+0101>ori opposition to contend with, the [[Swansea]] crowd were also hostile towards their own team, as they felt the [[Swansea RFC|Swansea]] backs should have been selected instead.<ref name="Billot17"/> Biggs, as an inexperienced new cap from rivals Cardiff, was picked out by the crowd as one of those players unworthy of his place and was heckled.<ref name="Billot17"/> Nonetheless, the Welsh team were victorious, with [[try|tries]] from [[George Thomas (rugby player)|Thomas]], [[William Towers|Towers]] and [[Jim Hannan (rugby player)|Hannan]] and a single conversion from Webb. A week later on the 29 December, Biggs faced the same tourists, this time as part of the Cardiff team. Biggs had been disappointing in his international debut, but regained his form on the pitch at the [[Cardiff Arms Park]].<ref name="Billot21">Billot (1972), pg 21.</ref> Within 90 seconds of the start of the match, Biggs scored a "sparkling try".<ref name="Billot21"/> Biggs should have scored again, but dropped the ball after crossing the line in the slippery conditions. Cardiff won by a goal and a try to one try.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.scrum.com/onthisday/rugby/story/107539.html |title=Maori come unstuck in Cardiff |author= |publisher=Scrum.com |date= |accessdate=27 August 2010}}</ref>

===Home Nations Championship matches===
Later in the 1888-89 season, Biggs was reselected for the Welsh team as part of the [[1889 Home Nations Championship]]. He was not chosen for the first game of the season against Scotland, but was accepted for the second and final game to Ireland. Under the captaincy of [[Arthur Gould (rugby player)|Arthur Gould]], Biggs was partnered on the wing by [[Abel Davies]] of [[London Welsh RFC|London Welsh]]. Wales lost to Ireland by two tries to nil, the first time the Irish had won on Welsh soil.<ref>Griffiths (1987), p. 3:3 - 3:6.</ref> Biggs and Davies were both dropped for the next season. 

It took Biggs until the [[1892 Home Nations Championship]] to regain his place in the national team, again he was chosen for the final game of the tournament against Ireland. Although the Welsh backs contained the talents of [[Billy Bancroft]], brothers [[Evan James (rugby player)|Evan]] and [[David James (rugby player)|David James]] and Arthur and [[Bert Gould]], the Welsh team were outclassed by [[Victor Le Fanu]]'s Ireland. It was the first time Wales had lost all three games in the Championship. Despite the loss Biggs was reselected for all three games of the [[1893 Home Nations Championship|1893 tournament]], all under the captaincy of "Monkey" Gould. In a reversal of fortunes from the previous season, Wales managed to win all three matches, lifting the [[Triple Crown (rugby union)|Triple Crown]] for the first time in the country's history.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rbs6nations.com/en/championship-information_trophies_triple-crown.php |title=Triple Crown|author= |publisher=International Rugby Board |date= |accessdate=27 August 2010}}</ref> Biggs played an important role during the Triple Crown winning season, scoring two tries, one each in the games against England and Scotland. The 1893 away game against Scotland is described as Biggs' best international match and 'his speed and general play were the main factors in securing the first victory of the [[Wales|Principality]] over Scotland at Scotland'.<ref name="NLoW"/> 

Biggs played in two more internationals for Wales, both in the [[1894 Home Nations Championship|1894 Championship]] and both resulted in losses. The first game of the 1894 Championship was against England, and Wales suffered a heavy defeat, losing 24-3. In an after match interview Biggs was asked why he had failed to tackle [[Harry Bradshaw (rugby)|Harry Bradshaw]], who scored the first try; Biggs responded "Tackle him? It was as much as I could do to get out of his way!".<ref>{{cite book |last=Richards |first=Huw |title=The Red And The White|year=2009 |publisher=Aurum Press Ltd |isbn= 9781845134051|page=38}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.scrum.com/wales/rugby/story/108523.html |title=Glass half full|author=Richards, Huw |publisher=Scrum.com |date=26 January 2010 |accessdate=27 August 2010}}</ref> In his final game against Ireland, Biggs was part of an all Cardiff three-quarters, along with [[Tom Pearson (rugby player)|Tom Pearson]], [[Dai Fitzgerald]] and [[Jack Elliott (rugby player)|Jack Elliott]]. The very next international saw Biggs' younger brother Selwyn selected for the first time, the brothers missing each other by just one match.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.scrum.com/statsguru/rugby/player/840.html?class=1;template=results;type=player;view=match |title=Player analysis / Norman Biggs / Test matches|author= |publisher=Scrum.com |date= |accessdate=31 August 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.scrum.com/statsguru/rugby/player/1125.html?class=1;template=results;type=player;view=match |title=Player analysis / Selwyn Biggs / Test matches|author= |publisher=Scrum.com |date= |accessdate=31 August 2010}}</ref>
