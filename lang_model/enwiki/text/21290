[[Sam Loxton]] was a member of [[Donald Bradman]]'s famous [[Australian cricket team in England in 1948|Australian cricket team, which toured England in 1948]]. Bradman<U+2019>s men went undefeated in their 34 matches; this unprecedented feat by a visiting side earned them the sobriquet ''The Invincibles''. 

A batting [[all rounder]], Loxton played as a right-handed [[batting order (cricket)|middle-order batsman]] and a right-arm [[fast bowling|fast medium]] bowler who reinforced the frontline pace attack of [[Ray Lindwall]], [[Keith Miller]] and [[Bill Johnston (cricketer)|Bill Johnston]]. Starting the tour as a fringe player, Loxton was omitted for the pre-Test fixtures against [[Worcestershire County Cricket Club|Worcestershire]] and the [[Marylebone Cricket Club]], where Australia traditionally fielded their full-strength team. He was overlooked for the first two Tests; reserve opening batsman [[Bill Brown (cricketer)|Bill Brown]] played out of position in the middle-order. However, Brown struggled in the unfamiliar role, and Loxton scored 159 [[not out]] against [[Gloucestershire CCC|Gloucestershire]] to oust the former from his position for the Third Test at [[Old Trafford (cricket ground)|Old Trafford]]. Loxton scored 36 to help Australia avoid the [[follow on]] and salvage a draw, before making his most notable contribution in the Fourth Test at [[Headingley]]. He took 3/55 in the first innings and scored a counter-attacking 93 on the third day to keep Australia in the game; they went on to win after a world record-breaking run-chase on the final day. Loxton also played in the Fifth Test and ended the series with 144 runs at a [[batting average]] of 48.00 and three wickets at a [[bowling average]] of 49.33.

In the tour matches, Loxton sometimes opened the bowling when Bradman sought to rest Lindwall and Miller to save their energy for the Tests, and he occasionally batted above the middle-order. Loxton was the [[economy rate|most economical]], but the least [[strike rate|incisive]] of the bowlers, and he never took more than three wickets in an innings. He played 22 [[first-class cricket|first-class matches]] and scored 973 runs at 57.23 with three [[century (cricket)|centuries]], and took 32 wickets at 21.71. He was eighth in the run-scoring aggregates, but was productive when given an opportunity, ranking fifth in the Australian averages. Loxton was the eighth-leading wicket-taker; all seven frontline bowlers ahead of him took at least 50 wickets. Noted for his energetic and combative approach, Loxton was twice forced out of action for his troubles; he pulled a groin while searching for extra pace with the ball early in the tour, and towards the end of the season, he hit a ball into his face and broke his nose.

== Background and early matches ==
After serving in [[World War II]], Loxton was demobilised and rose through the cricketing ranks to make his first-class debut in 1946&ndash;47.<Ref name=az/> He was an [[all rounder]]&mdash;a right-handed middle-order batsman and a right-arm fast bowler. During the 1947&ndash;48 Australian season, [[India national cricket team|India]] toured Australia for five Tests, and the home team dominated, taking an unassailable 3&ndash;0 series lead after the first four matches. The Australian selectors then decided to use the Fifth Test at the [[Melbourne Cricket Ground]] to give opportunities to players on the fringes of the national team to show their capabilities ahead of the 1948 tour of England. Loxton was one of several debutants, and he seized his chance. He scored 80 and took three wickets as an all rounder in the Australian victory, and was rewarded with inclusion in the 17-man touring party.<ref name=debut>{{Cite book

Loxton<U+2019>s debut had come about because first-choice opener [[Arthur Morris]] had been rested from the Fifth Test so that the selectors could trial potential players for the 1948 tour.

In the next match against [[Leicestershire County Cricket Club|Leicestershire]], Loxton was given his first chance on English soil. Batting at No. 7, he managed only four before being trapped [[leg before wicket]] by Australian expatriate [[left arm orthodox spin]]ner [[Vic Jackson]],<Ref>Fingleton, p. 49.</ref> as Australia amassed 448. He then opened the bowling and [[bowled|castled]] home captain [[Les Berry]] for one to leave the hosts at 1/1 and take his first wicket on English soil. He also took two catches, both from the bowling of fellow Victorian [[Doug Ring]] as the hosts fell for 130. Loxton again opened the bowling in the second innings as Australia enforced the [[follow on]] and dismissed the hosts for 147 to seal another innings win.

Loxton came in at 4/466 and put on 63 with Harvey, before his fellow Victorian was out for 95. He then added 104 with [[Colin McCool]] and 105 with [[Ian Johnson (cricketer)|Ian Johnson]]. Loxton was on 159 when Johnson lost his wicket, which prompted acting captain [[Lindsay Hassett]] to [[declaration and forfeiture|declare the innings closed]].<Ref name=gloucs/> Loxton's innings involved a series of powerful strokes that went for [[six (cricket)|six]] and he was particularly noted for using his feet to charge and attack the [[off spin]] of [[Tom Goddard]].<Ref>Fingleton, pp. 198&ndash;199.</ref> The Gloucestershire bowler had been touted as a possible Test selection, because the other England bowlers had failed to contain Australia<U+2019>s batsman in the first two matches, but his chances of selection were ended with the tourists<U+2019> assault at Bristol.<Ref>Pollard, p. 12.</ref> Immediately after the declaration, Loxton opened the bowling and ended with 1/22 from as Gloucestershire were all out for 269.

== Third Test ==
{{main|Third Test, 1948 Ashes series}}
<!-- [[Image:BillBrown2.jpg|Bill Brown (pictured) kept Loxton out of the first two Tests.|thumb]] -->

Australia and England reassembled at [[Old Trafford (cricket ground)|Old Trafford]] for the Third Test. Following his unbeaten 159 in the previous match and Brown's struggles when playing in the middle-order, Loxton took Brown's position.<Ref name="sco2"/><Ref name="sco3"/> Brown had scored 25, 26, 17, 24 and 32 in the middle-order in the matches against Worcestershire, the MCC and the first two Tests.<Ref name=worcs/><ref name=sco1/><ref name=sco2/><Ref name=mcc/> England captain [[Norman Yardley]] won the [[toss (cricket)|toss]] and elected to bat, and Loxton bowled first change, sending down seven overs for the loss of 18 runs.<Ref name=sco3/> 

On the second morning, English tailender [[Alec Bedser]] had reached 37. His partner [[Denis Compton]] hit a ball into the [[Fielding (cricket)#Fielding position names and locations|covers]] and Bradman and Loxton collided in an attempt to field the ball and prevent a run. Compton called Bedser through for a run on the misfield, but Loxton recovered and threw the ball to the wicket-keeper's end. Bedser was a long way short of the [[crease (cricket)|crease]] and was run out.<ref name=f136>Fingleton, p. 136.</ref> The wicket ended an innings of 145 minutes, in which Bedser scored 37 in a 121-run partnership.<Ref name=sco3/> England then lost their last three wickets for 26 runs to be all out for 363.<ref name=sco3/>

On the third day, Loxton and wicket-keeper [[Don Tallon]] both came to the crease with Australia in difficulty at 5/139.<ref name=sco3/> Tallon and Loxton added a further 43 before the gloveman was caught behind from [[Bill Edrich]]. Lindwall came to the crease to join Loxton at 6/172 as Australia faced the prospect of being forced to follow on.<Ref name="sco3"/> The pair added a further 36 before Loxton was bowled by [[Dick Pollard]], leaving Australia 7/208, still five runs behind the follow on mark, which they scraped past to end with 221.<Ref name=sco3/> Loxton again bowled first change in the second innings, taking 0/29 from eight overs as England reached 3/174 at the end of the third day. The fourth day was washed out and England declared without further batting after rain delayed the start on the final day.<ref name="report3">{{Cite web|title= Third Test Match England v Australia |work= [[Wisden Cricketers' Almanack]] |year=1949  |url=http://www.cricinfo.com/wisdenalmanack/content/story/152896.html |accessdate=2008-07-02 |publisher=[[Wisden]]}}</ref> Play began after the tea break, and Australia needed to score 317 in the last session, while England required ten wickets for victory.

After the Test, Loxton bowled first change in the first innings against [[Middlesex County Cricket Club|Middlesex]]. He took 3/33 from 21 overs as the hosts were bowled out for 203. Loxton removed [[Leslie Compton]], his younger brother and England Test batsman [[Denis Compton|Denis]], and [[Jim Sims]] in the space of five runs to reduce Middlesex from 5/182 to 8/188. Loxton then joined Morris at the crease, with Australia in difficulty at 3/53. They put on 172 before Morris was out for 109 and Loxton followed him at 5/271 for the top-score of 123. Australia then collapsed to be all out for 317.

== Fourth Test ==
{{main|Fourth Test, 1948 Ashes series}}

The teams headed to [[Headingley]] in [[Leeds]] for the Fourth Test. Harvey came in for the injured Barnes,<ref>Perry (2002), p. 101.</ref> joining Loxton in the middle-order. Brown was not recalled to join Morris at the top of the order; instead, Hassett was promoted as a makeshift opener.<Ref name=sco3/><Ref name=sco4/> 

England won the toss and elected to bat on an ideal batting pitch<Ref name="sco4"/><Ref name="report4"/> that was expected to be unhelpful for [[fast bowling]].<Ref name=f154/> Opener [[Len Hutton]] was dropped by Hassett on 25, after flicking the ball [[Fielding (cricket)#Fielding position names and locations|behind square leg]] from Loxton<U+2019>s bowling.<Ref name=f152>Fingleton, p. 152.</ref> This proved to be costly, as Hutton reached 81 before falling at 1/168. England were 2/268 at the end of the first day.<ref name=sco4/> Former Australian Test batsman [[Jack Fingleton]] said that Australia's day went "progressively downhill" and said that it was the country<U+2019>s worst day of bowling since World War II, citing the proliferation of [[full toss]]es.<ref name=f154>Fingleton, p. 154.</ref>

On the second morning, the nightwatchman [[Alec Bedser]] was attacking Australia. He took 14 from one [[Ernie Toshack]] over, before taking another 14 from an [[Ian Johnson (cricketer)|Ian Johnson]] over soon after to reach 47. Loxton was brought on and Bedser hit a ball back near the bowler<U+2019>s grasp, but it narrowly evaded Loxton.<ref name="report4"/><Ref name=f156>Fingleton, p. 156.</ref> Bedser reached 79 and England 2/423 when he finally fell, triggering a collapse. At 6/486, Loxton bowled [[Ken Cranston]] for 10 to take his first Ashes wicket,<ref name=sco4/> before removing [[Godfrey Evans]] and [[Jim Laker]] in quick succession as England fell to 9/496, before Miller took the final wicket without further addition to the score. Loxton ended with 3/55 from 26 overs, the second best [[economy rate]] among the Australians.<Ref name=sco4/>
<!-- [[Image:Harvey and Loxton.jpg|thumb|[[Neil Harvey]] and Loxton. Their first innings partnership kept Australia in the Fourth Test.|300px]] -->
On the third morning, Loxton came to the crease to join Harvey with the score at 4/189. Australia had been in trouble after losing two quick wickets to be 3/68, but Miller and Harvey counterattacked, adding 121 runs in 90 minutes, their batting likened by ''[[Wisden]]'' to a "hurricane".<ref name="wisden">{{cite web|title= Wisden 1954 &mdash; Neil Harvey|url=http://www.cricinfo.com/australia/content/story/154608.html| publisher=[[Wisden]] |year=1954|accessdate=2007-06-06}}</ref> Fingleton said that he had never "known a more enjoyable hour" of "delectable cricket".<Ref>Fingleton, pp. 162&ndash;163.</ref> Harvey was unperturbed by Miller's departure, hitting 11 from three consecutive balls. Australia went to lunch at 4/204, with Harvey on 70.<Ref name=f164>Fingleton, p. 164.</ref>

After lunch, Australia scored slowly as Loxton struggled to come to grips with the bowling. Yardley took the new ball in an attempt to trouble the batsmen, but instead, Loxton began to settle in as the ball came onto the bat more quickly. He lofted Pollard to the [[leg side]], almost for six, and then hit three [[boundary (cricket)|boundaries]] off another over from the same bowler. Harvey accelerated as well, and 80 minutes into the session, reached his century to a loud reception as Australia passed 250.<Ref name=f165>Fingleton, p. 165.</ref> Loxton then dominated the scoring with a display of power hitting. He brought up his 50 by hitting Cranston into the pavilion for six, eliciting spontaneous applause from the English players.<Ref name=f165/> It also brought up a century stand, which yielded 105 in only 95 minutes. Harvey was out for 112 from 183 balls,<Ref name=f166>Fingleton, p. 166.</ref> but not before the high [[run rate]] during the partnership had helped to swing the match back from England's firm control.<ref name="wisden"/><ref name="az">{{cite book | last = Cashman, Franks, Maxwell, Sainsbury, Stoddart, Weaver, Webster | year = 1997 | title = The A&ndash;Z of Australian cricketers|pages =174&ndash;175| isbn=0-9756746-1-7}}</ref>

Harvey's departure at 5/294 meant that the first of the bowlers, Johnson, entered the ground. This did not deter Loxton, who was particularly severe on Laker, lifting him into the crowd for four more sixes. Loxton hit two over the leg side followed by consecutive [[Batting (cricket)#Types of batting shots|off drives]] into the gallery.<ref name="report4"/><Ref name=f166/><ref name="p247">Perry (2005), p. 247.</ref> Johnson scored 10 before falling with the score at 6/329.<Ref name="sco4"/> Fifteen runs later,<Ref name=sco4/> Yardley bowled Loxton for 93. Loxton appeared disappointed at playing such a wild cross-batted swing with a maiden Test century beckoning.<Ref name=f166/> Lindwall then made 77 to propel Australia to 458 on the fourth day, just 38 runs in arrears.<Ref name=sco4/>

In the second innings, Loxton took 0/29 from ten overs, and England batted on for five minutes on the final morning, adding three runs in two overs before Yardley declared at 8/365.<ref name="sco4"/><Ref name="report4"/> Batting into the final day allowed Yardley to ask the groundsman to use a [[road roller|heavy roller]]. This would help to break up the wicket and make the surface more likely to spin, therefore making life more difficult for Australia<U+2019>s batsmen.<Ref name="report4"/>

Yardley<U+2019>s declaration left Australia to chase 404 runs for victory. At the time, this would have been the highest ever fourth innings score to result in a Test victory for the batting side. Australia had only 345 minutes to reach the target, but they completed their task with 15 minutes to spare and seven wickets in hand to seal the series 3&ndash;0, with Loxton not required to bat.<Ref name=sco4/><ref name=report4>{{Cite web|title= Fourth Test Match England v Australia |work= [[Wisden Cricketers' Almanack]] |year=1949  |url=http://www.cricinfo.com/wisdenalmanack/content/story/152897.html |accessdate=2008-07-02 |publisher=[[Wisden]]}}</ref><ref name="b ashes">Perry (2001), pp. 84&ndash;89.</ref>

After the Headingley Test, Loxton came in at 5/344 and made 51 as Australia batted first and made 456 against [[Derbyshire County Cricket Club|Derbyshire]]. He then took 1/27 from 17.4 overs in the first innings. Australia enforced the follow on and Loxton took the first wicket before returning to take two tail-end wickets and end with 3/16 from 13.4 overs as Australia won by an innings. Loxton was the most economical of the Australian wicket-takers.<Ref name=o/><Ref name=sched/><ref name=derby/> After six consecutive matches,<Ref name=o/><ref name=sched/> Loxton was rested for the rain-affected draw against [[Glamorgan County Cricket Club|Glamorgan]], which did not reach the second innings.<ref name=sched/> The hosts were bowled out for 197 and Australia reached 3/215 when inclement weather ended the match.<Ref name=o/><Ref name=sched/><ref name=glam>{{cite web

Loxton returned in the next match and claimed both openers to end with 2/27 from 19 overs as [[Warwickshire County Cricket Club|Warwickshire]] were bowled out for 138 in their first innings. He then made a duck as Australia struggled to 254 in reply. Loxton bowled six overs and took 0/15 in the second innings before Australia won by nine wickets.<ref name=o/><Ref name=sched/><ref name=warwick/> Australia then faced and drew with Lancashire for the second time on the tour.

Seven matches remained on Bradman's quest to go through a tour of England without defeat.<Ref name=sched/> Loxton made 16 of 361 as Australia batted first against [[Kent County Cricket Club|Kent]]. He came on late in the first innings and took three of the last four wickets as the hosts fell for 51 in just 23 overs. Loxton bowled all of his victims as the hosts fell from 5/48 to 51 all out. It was a similar tale in the second innings, as Loxton removed opener [[Jack Davies (cricketer)|Jack Davies]] for a duck and ended with 1/12 from six overs as the hosts fell for 124 in only 32.5 overs.

Australia's biggest challenge in the post-Test tour matches was against the Leveson-Gower's XI.

After than his productivity dipped with five sub-20 scores in a row, before a 60+ score in his penultimate innings.]] 

A batting [[all rounder]], Loxton played as a right-handed middle-order batsman and a right-arm [[fast bowling|fast medium]] bowler who reinforced the frontline pace attack of Lindwall, Miller and [[Bill Johnston (cricketer)|Bill Johnston]]. When fit, the trio all bowled before Loxton in the Tests.<Ref name=sco3/><ref name=sco4/><ref name=sco5/> With medium pacer [[Ernie Toshack]] and [[off spin]]ner [[Ian Johnson (cricketer)|Ian Johnson]] also playing in the Third and Fourth Tests, Loxton was the sixth bowler.<ref name=sco3/><Ref name=sco4/> In the Fifth Test, Johnson was replaced by [[leg spin]]ner Ring and the injured Toshack was replaced by a batsman, so Loxton became the fifth bowler.<Ref name=sco4/><ref name=sco5/> Of the seven regular bowlers, Loxton was the only one who was not a frontline bowler, and as such he had worst average, the second-worst [[economy rate]] and the third worst [[strike rate]].<ref name=aus/> Loxton ended the Test series with 144 runs at 48.00 and three wickets at 49.33, having bowled 63 overs. Loxton batted at No. 6 or No. 7 during the Tests, and was the last batsman in the batting order before the [[wicket-keeper]] and the bowlers.<Ref name=sco3/><Ref name=sco4/><ref name=sco5/>

In the tour matches, Loxton sometimes opened the bowling when Bradman sought to rest Lindwall and Miller in order to conserve their energy for the Tests, such as in both innings of the match against Northamptonshire and the second match against Surrey.<Ref name=northants/><ref name=surrey2/> In his 22 first-class innings, he batted twice at No. 4 and opened in one innings, but he was otherwise invariably in the middle-order between No. 5 and No. 7.<sup><span style="color:#00f">N-</span></sup>{{Ref label|bat|1|a}} Loxton was the most economical of those who bowled more than 70 overs, but also the least incisive, taking a wicket every 67.75 balls, and he never took more than three wickets in an innings, which he managed on three occasions. He played 22 first-class matches and scored 973 runs at 57.23 with three centuries and took 32 wickets at 21.71. Loxton was eighth in the run-scoring aggregates, but was given less opportunities than the other frontline batsmen who scored more heavily; whereas he had 22 innings, they all had at least 26 innings and tended to bat higher in the order. However, Loxton was productive when given a chance, ranking fifth in the averages. Loxton was the eighth-leading wicket-taker; all seven ahead of him took at least 50 wickets.<Ref name=aus>{{cite web| url=http://stats.cricinfo.com/ci/engine/records/averages/batting_bowling_by_team.html?id=83;team=2;type=series |publisher=[[Cricinfo]] |title=Batting and bowling averages The Ashes, 1948 - Australia |accessdate=2008-12-10}}</ref><ref name=fc>{{cite web| url=http://stats.cricinfo.com/ci/engine/records/averages/batting_bowling.html?class=4;id=1070;type=tour |publisher=[[Cricinfo]] |title=Batting and bowling averages Australia tour of England, Apr-Sep 1948 - First-class matches|accessdate=2008-12-10}}</ref>

''[[Wisden Cricketers' Almanack]]'' summed up his contribution thus: {{quote|A fine [[Batting (cricket)#Types of batting shots|driving batsman with a fierce square cut]], Loxton achieved little as a bowler, but he played his part as an all-rounder, one of many in the team; in addition to his batting feats, he kept the game alive by his unlimited enthusiasm.
