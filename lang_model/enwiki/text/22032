A '''Pisco Sour''' is a [[cocktail]] typical of [[Cuisine of the Americas|South American cuisine]]. The drink's name is a combination of the word ''[[pisco]]'', which is its base liquor, and the term ''[[Sour (cocktail)|sour]]'', in reference to sour citrus juice and sweetener components. The Peruvian Pisco Sour uses Peruvian pisco as the base liquor and adds [[Key lime]] (or lemon) juice, [[syrup]], ice, [[egg white]], and [[Angostura bitters]]. The Chilean version is similar, but uses Chilean pisco, [[Pica, Chile|Pica]] lemon, and excludes the bitters and egg white. Other variants of the cocktail include those created with fruits like [[pineapple]] or plants such as [[coca]] leaves.

The cocktail originated in Lima, Peru, and was invented by [[Victor Vaughn Morris]], an American [[bartender]], in the early 1920s. Morris left his native United States in 1903 to work in [[Cerro de Pasco]], a city in central Peru. In 1916, he opened Morris' Bar in Lima, and his saloon quickly became a popular spot for the Peruvian upper class and English-speaking foreigners. The Pisco Sour underwent several changes until Mario Bruiget, a Peruvian bartender working at Morris' Bar, created the modern Peruvian recipe of the cocktail in the latter part of the 1920s by adding Angostura bitters and egg whites to the mix.

In Chile, historian [[Oreste Plath]] attributed the invention of the drink to Elliot Stubb, an English [[Steward's assistant|steward]] of a ship named ''Sunshine'', who allegedly mixed key lime juice, syrup, and ice cubes to create the cocktail in a bar in the port city of [[Iquique]] in 1872. The original source cited by Plath attributed the invention of [[whiskey sour]] to Stubb, not Pisco Sour. The oldest known mentions of the Pisco Sour are from a 1921 magazine attributing Morris as the inventor and a 1924 advertisement for Morris' Bar published in a newspaper from the port of [[Valpara<U+00ED>so]], Chile.

Chile and Peru both claim the Pisco Sour as their [[List of national liquors|national drink]], and each asserts exclusive ownership of both pisco and the cocktail. Peru celebrates a yearly [[public holiday]] in honor of the cocktail during the first Saturday of February. The two kinds of pisco and the two variations in the style of preparing the Pisco Sour are distinct in both production and taste. Thus the Pisco Sour has become a significant and oft-debated topic of [[Latin America]]n popular culture.

== Name ==
The term ''sour'' refers to mixed drinks containing a base [[Distilled beverage|liquor]] (bourbon or whiskey), lemon or lime juice, and a sweetener.{{sfn|Regan|2003|p=159}} ''Pisco'' refers to the base liquor used in the cocktail. The word as applied to the alcoholic beverage comes from the Peruvian [[Pisco, Peru|port of Pisco]]. In the book ''Latin America and the Caribbean'', historian Olwyn Blouet and political geographer Brian Blouet describe the development of vineyards in early [[Viceroyalty of Peru|Colonial Peru]] and how in the second half of the sixteenth century a market for the liquor formed owing to the demand from growing mining settlements in the [[Andes]]. Subsequent demand for a stronger drink caused Pisco and the nearby city of [[Ica, Peru|Ica]] to establish distilleries "to make wine into brandy",{{sfn|Blouet|Blouet|2009|p=318}} and the product received the name of the port from where it was distilled and exported.<ref>{{cite web|author=Real Academia Espa<U+00F1>ola|url=http://lema.rae.es/drae/?val=pisco|title=Pisco|publisher=Diccionario de la Lengua Espa<U+00F1>ola&nbsp;<U+2013> Vig<U+00E9>sima Segunda Edici<U+00F3>n|accessdate=2012-12-03|language=Spanish}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=''Concise Oxford Dictionary''|url=http://www.wordreference.com/definition/pisco|title=Pisco|publisher=WordReference.com|accessdate=2012-12-03}}</ref>

According to historian [[Luciano Revoredo]], the preparation of pisco with lemon dates as far back as the 18th century. He bases his claim on a source found in the ''[[Mercurio Peruano]]'' which details the prohibition of aguardiente in Lima's ''[[Plaza de toros de Acho]]'', the oldest bullring in the Americas. At this time, the drink was named ''Punche'' ({{lang-en|[[Punch (drink)|Punch]]}}), and was sold by slaves. Revoredo further argues this drink served as the predecessor of the Californian [[Pisco punch]], invented by Duncan Nicol in the Bank Exchange Bar of [[San Francisco]], California.<ref>{{cite web|author=Pilar Lazo Rivera, Carmen del |url=http://www.pediatriaperu.org/images/stories/PDF/62N1/revista%20pediatria%20interior.pdf#page=59 |title=Pisco Sour del Per<U+00FA> |publisher=Pediatraperu.org|year=2009|accessdate=2012-12-03|language=Spanish}}</ref>

Some discrepancy exists on the exact date when Morris created the popular cocktail. Mixologist [[Dale DeGroff]] asserts the drink was invented in 1915,{{sfn|DeGroff|2008|p="Pisco Sour"}} but most other sources argue this happened in the 1920s.{{sfn|Kosmas|Zaric|2010|p=115}}{{sfn|Parsons|2011|p=143}} The Chilean web newspaper ''[[El Mercurio Online]]'' specifically contends historians attribute the year of the drink's invention as 1922, adding that "one night Morris surprised his friends with a new drink he called ''Pisco Sour'', a formula which mixes the Peruvian ''Pisco'' with the American ''[[Sour (cocktail)|sour]]''" (in Spanish: "''Una noche Morris sorprendi<U+00F3> a sus amigos con una nueva bebida a la que llam<U+00F3> pisco sour, una f<U+00F3>rmula que funde lo peruano del pisco con el 'sour' estadounidense.''").<ref name=Emol>{{cite web|agency=Agence France-Presse|url=http://www.emol.com/noticias/economia/2011/02/05/462760/peruanos-celebran-el-dia-del-pisco-sour-con-degustaciones-y-fiestas.html|title=Peruanos Celebran el "D<U+00ED>a del Pisco Sour" con Degustaciones y Fiestas|publisher=Emol.com|date=February 5, 2011|accessdate=2012-12-03|language=Spanish}}</ref>

The original recipe of the Pisco Sour, as invented by Morris, has not yet been found. According to Peruvian researcher Guillermo Toro-Lira, "it is assumed that it was a crude mix of pisco with lime juice and sugar, as was the whiskey sour of those days". The cocktail's recipe continued to evolve, and the bar's registry shows customers commented on the continuously improving taste of the drink.<ref name=Toro/> The last version of the recipe was developed by Mario Bruiget, a Peruvian from [[Chincha Alta]] who worked under the [[apprenticeship]] of Morris starting on July 16, 1924. Bruiget's recipe added the Angostura bitters and egg whites to the mix.<ref name=Tatiana/>

Morris used advertisements to promote his bar and invention. The oldest known mention of the Pisco Sour comes from an April 22, 1921, edition of the Peruvian magazine ''Mundial''. In the magazine, not only is the Pisco Sour described as a white-colored beverage, but its invention is attributed to "Mister Morris".<ref name=Coloma>{{cite web|author=Coloma Porcari, C<U+00E9>sar |url=https://sites.google.com/site/historiadelpiscosour/verdadera-historia-del-pisco-sour|title=La Verdadera Historia del Pisco Sour|publisher=Revista Cultural de Lima|pages=72<U+2013>73|year=2005|accessdate=2012-12-03|language=Spanish}}</ref> Later, in 1924, with the aid of Morris' friend Nelson Rounsevell, the bar advertised its locale and invention in [[Valpara<U+00ED>so]], Chile. The advertisement featured in the Valparaiso newspaper ''South Pacific Mail'', owned by Rounsevell.<ref name=Toro/> By 1927, Morris' Bar had attained widespread notability for its cocktails, particularly the Pisco Sour. Brad Thomas Parsons writes that "the registry at the Morris Bar was filled with high praise from visitors who raved about the signature drink".<ref name=Tatiana/>{{sfn|Parsons|2011|p=143}}

Over time, competition from nearby bars and Victor Morris' declining health led to the decline and fall of his enterprise. During this time, as a result of his worsening health, Morris delegated most of the bartending to his employees. Adding to the problem, nearby competitors, such as the [[Hotel Bol<U+00ED>var]] and Hotel Lima Country Club, housed bars which took clientele away from Morris' Bar. Moreover, Toro-Lira discovered that Morris accused four of his former bartenders of intellectual property theft after they left to work in one of these competing establishments. In 1929, Morris declared voluntary [[bankruptcy]] and closed his saloon. A few months later, on June 11, Victor Vaughn Morris died of [[cirrhosis]].<ref name=Toro/><ref name=Tatiana/>

After Morris closed his bar, Bruiget began working as a bartender for the nearby [[Grand Hotel Maury]], where he continued to serve his Pisco Sour recipe. His success with the drink led local Limean oral tradition to associate the Hotel Maury as the original home of the Pisco Sour.<ref name=Tatiana/> As other former apprentices of Morris found other work, they also spread the Pisco Sour recipe.<ref name=Coloma/> During the 1930s the drink made its way into [[California]], reaching bars as far north as the city of San Francisco.{{sfn|Kosmas|Zaric|2010|p=115}} By at least the late 1960s the cocktail also found its way to [[New York]].{{sfn|Regan|2003|p=317}}

=== Nationality dispute ===
In Chile, a local [[Urban legend|story]] developed in the 1980s attributing the invention of the Pisco Sour to Elliot Stubb, an English steward from a [[sailing ship]] named "Sunshine". Chilean folklorist and historian [[Oreste Plath]] contributed to the legend's propagation by writing that, according to the Peruvian newspaper ''El Comercio de Iquique'', in 1872 Stubb opened a bar in the then-Peruvian port of [[Iquique]] (after obtaining leave to disembark) and invented the Pisco Sour while experimenting with drinks.<ref name=Toro/>{{sfn|Plath|1981|p=106}}{{efn-ua|Iquique was later occupied by Chile during the [[War of the Pacific]] and annexed in 1883.}} This has caused an ongoing dispute between Chile and Peru over the origin of Pisco Sour.<ref>{{cite web|author=Garbee, Jenn|url=http://www.latimes.com/features/la-fo-cocktail21-2008may21,0,6060310.story|title=A Summer Twist On Pisco Sour, Caipirinha Cocktails|work=Los Angeles Times|date=May 21, 2008 |accessdate=2012-12-03}}</ref>

Nevertheless, researcher Toro-Lira argues the story "has been recently refuted when it was found that the original historical source, the newspaper ''El Comercio de Iquique'', was mentioning instead the alleged invention of the whiskey sour and not of the Pisco Sour".<ref name=Toro/> This claim is further certified by the [[National University of Cuyo|University of Cuyo]], located in Argentina, which in 1962 published the story of Elliot Stubb and his alleged invention of the [[whiskey sour]] in Iquique.

The Peruvian and Chilean versions of the Pisco Sour are prepared differently. The Peruvian Pisco Sour cocktail is made by mixing Peruvian [[pisco]] with lime juice, [[Syrup|simple syrup]], [[egg white]], [[Angostura bitters]] (for [[Cocktail garnish|garnish]]), and ice cubes.{{sfn|Kosmas|Zaric|2010|p=115}} The Chilean Pisco Sour cocktail is made by mixing Chilean Pisco with [[Pica, Chile|Pica]] lemon juice, [[powdered sugar]], and ice cubes.{{sfn|Castillo-Feli<U+00FA>|2000|p=79}} Daniel Joelson, a food writer and critic, contends that the major difference between both Pisco Sour versions "is that Peruvians generally include egg whites, while Chileans do not."<ref>{{cite journal |last=Joelson |first=Daniel |title=The Pisco Wars |journal= Gastronomica: the Journal of Food and Culture |volume= 4 | issue = 1 |year= 2004|month= Winter | doi= 10.1525/gfc.2004.4.1.1 | pages=6<U+2013>8}}</ref>

Considerable variations also exist in the pisco used in the cocktails. According to food and wine expert Mark Spivak, the difference is in the way both beverages are produced; whereas "Chilean pisco is mass-produced", the Peruvian version "is made in small batches".<ref>{{cite web|author=Spivak, Mark |url=http://www.palmbeachillustrated.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=news.details&ArticleId=1609&|title=Pour&nbsp;<U+2013> Pisco Fever |publisher=PalmBeachIllustrated.com|accessdate=2012-12-03}}</ref> Cocktail historian Andrew Bohrer focuses his comparison on taste, claiming that "[i]n Peru, pisco is made in a pot still, distilled to proof, and un-aged; it is very similar to [[grappa]].

Tapia concludes this is why Peruvian pisco bottles denote their [[vintage]] year and the Chilean versions do not.<ref name=Tapia>{{cite web|url=http://piscosour.com/2013/01/entrevista-patricio-tapia-periodista-chileno-especializado-en-vinos/|title=Entrevista: Patricio Tapia <U+2013> Periodista Chileno Especializado en Vinos|publisher=PiscoSour.com|year=2012|accessdate=2012-09-11|language=Spanish}}</ref>

Variations of the Pisco Sour exist in Peru, [[Bolivia]], and Chile. There are adaptations of the cocktail in Peru using fruits such as ''[[Passiflora edulis|maracuya]]'', ''[[Physalis peruviana|aguaymanto]]'', and apples, or traditional ingredients such the [[coca]] leaf.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://piscosour.com/?cat=3|title=Recetas|publisher=PiscoSour.com|year=2012|accessdate=2012-12-03|language=Spanish}}</ref> In Chile, variants include the Aj<U+00ED> Sour (with a spicy green chili), Mango Sour (with [[mango]] juice), and Sour de Campo (with ginger and honey).

Cocktails similar to the Pisco Sour include the Chilean [[Piscola]] and the Peruvian [[Algarrobina Cocktail]].

During the 2008 [[Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation|APEC]] Economic Leaders' Meeting, Peru promoted its Pisco Sour with widespread acceptance. According to Antonio Brack, Peru's Environment Minister, "Pisco Sour has been the 'star' of the APEC Summit, the drink was served in several meetings at the Government Palace and the APEC Summit venue".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.andina.com.pe/Ingles/Noticia.aspx?Id=dgLcZ6OY0yg=|title=Peru's Pisco Sour Delights APEC Leaders|publisher=Andina.com|date=November 23, 2008|accessdate=2012-12-03}}</ref> At the start of the summit, [[South Korea]]n President [[Lee Myung-Bak]] affirmed that "Koreans are drinking Latin American liquors such as pisco sour, and at the same time tango, samba and salsa are gaining popularity among the younger generation in Korea".<ref>{{cite web|author=AFP |url=http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5htJl2uc0-vCbYJezPLP7oQwgdpUw|title=Peru summit hits sour note with 'Pisco diplomacy'|publisher=Google.com|date=November 22, 2008|accessdate=2013-06-19}}</ref>

American [[celebrity chef]] [[Anthony Bourdain]] also drew attention to the cocktail when, in an episode of his [[Travel Channel]] program ''[[Anthony Bourdain: No Reservations|No Reservations]]'', he drank a Pisco Sour in Valparaiso, Chile, and said "that's good, but ... next time, I'll have a beer". The broadcaster [[Radio Programas del Per<U+00FA>]] reported that Jorge L<U+00F3>pez Sotomayor, the episode's Chilean producer and Bourdain's travel partner in Chile, said Bourdain found the Pisco Sour he drank in Valparaiso as boring and worthless (in Spanish: "''A m<U+00ED> me dijo que el pisco sour lo encontr<U+00F3> aburrido y que no val<U+00ED>a la pena.''"). Lopez added that Bourdain had recently arrived from Peru, where he drank several Pisco Sours which he thought tasted better than the Chilean version.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rpp.com.pe/2009-07-18-chef-anthony-bourdain-pisco-sour-chileno-es-aburrido-y-no-vale-la-pena-noticia_195507.html|title=Chef Anthony Bourdain: Pisco Sour Chileno es Aburrido y No Vale la Pena|publisher=RPP.com.pe|date=July 18, 2009|accessdate=2012-10-20|language=Spanish}}</ref>

In Mexico, singer-songwriter [[Aleks Syntek]] controversially posted on [[Twitter]] that the Pisco Sour is Chilean. After receiving critical responses to his statement, Syntek apologized and mentioned he was only joking.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rpp.com.pe/detalle.php?nid=312238&op=7|title=Alex Syntek Dice Que el Pisco Sour y La Tigresa del Oriente Son Chilenos|publisher=RPP.com|date=November 19, 2010|accessdate=2012-12-03|language=Spanish}}</ref> Mexican television host and comedian [[Adal Ramones]] also joked about Pisco Sour, in reference to the [[2009 Chile<U+2013>Peru espionage scandal]], on November 17, 2009. Ramones, a fan of Peruvian Pisco, when asked about the espionage, asked what Chileans were spying on in Peru, suggesting it might be how to make a Pisco Sour (in Spanish: "''<U+00BF>Qu<U+00E9> quieren espiar los chilenos? <U+00BF>C<U+00F3>mo hacer pisco sour?''").<ref>{{cite web|url=http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:C2QZXmDsHCoJ:elcomercio.pe/espectaculos/370244/noticia-adal-ramones-que-quieren-espiar-chilenos-como-hacer-pisco-sour+Que+quieren+espiar+los+chilenos+como+hacer+pisco+sour+ramones&hl=en&gl=us&prmd=imvns&strip=1|title=Adal Ramones: "<U+00BF>Qu<U+00E9> Quieren Espiar los Chilenos? <U+00BF>C<U+00F3>mo Hacer Pisco Sour?"|publisher=ElComercio.com|date=November 17, 2009|accessdate=2012-12-03|language=Spanish}}</ref>
