'''INS ''Vikrant''''' ([[Hindi]]: <U+0935><U+093F><U+0915><U+094D><U+0930><U+093E><U+0928><U+094D><U+200D><U+0924>) (formerly '''HMS ''Hercules'' (R49)''') was a [[Majestic class aircraft carrier|''Majestic''-class]] light [[aircraft carrier]] of the [[Royal Navy]]. Her keel was laid down [[November 12]], [[1943]] by [[Vickers-Armstrong]] was launched on [[September 22]], [[1945]]. Construction was suspended after [[World War II]] and she was laid up for possible future use. In January 1957 she was sold to [[India]], and construction was completed at [[Harland and Wolff]] with an extensively modernized design, including an angled deck with steam catapults, a modified island, and many other improvements.

==History==
The Indian high commissioner to the [[United Kingdom]], [[Vijayalakshmi Pandit]], commissioned her as '''INS ''Vikrant''''' on [[March 4]], [[1961]] while she was still at [[Belfast]], [[Northern Ireland]]. The name ''Vikrant'' was taken from [[Sanskrit]] ''vikr<U+0101>nta'' = "stepped beyond", i.e. "courageous", "victorious". Captain Pritam Singh was the first commanding officer of the carrier. She formally joined the Indian fleet at [[Mumbai|Bombay]] on [[November 3]], [[1961]], when she was received at Ballard Pier by Prime Minister [[Jawaharlal Nehru]] and other high-ranking dignitaries.

The ''Vikrant'''s initial airwing consisted of British [[Hawker Sea Hawk]] fighter-bombers and a French [[Breguet Alize|Alize]] anti-submarine aircraft. On [[May 18]], [[1961]], the first jet landed on board, piloted by Lieutenant (later Admiral) R H Tahiliani.

In 1965, [[Pakistan]] claimed that it had sunk the ''Vikrant''.  At the time, however, the ship was under refit in [[dry dock]].

Despite a crack in a boiler, she saw real combat against Pakistan in the [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1971]]. She was considered important enough by the [[Pakistan Navy]] that they sent the submarine [[PNS Ghazi|''Ghazi'']] all the way to the [[Bay of Bengal]] to mine the [[Visakhapatnam]] harbor in an unsuccessful attempt to sink the ''Vikrant''; the Ghazi itself was lost during the mission. The ''Vikrant'' played an instrumental role in sinking several Pakistani patrol boats and other naval vessels. During the war the crew of ''Vikrant'' earned two [[Mahavir Chakra]]s and 12 [[Vir Chakra]]s.

''Vikrant'' was given an extensive refit, including new engines and modernization between 1979 and [[January 3]], [[1982]]. Between December 1982 and February 1983 she was refitted again to enable her to operate Sea Harriers. After the retirement of the Breguet Aliz<U+00E9> from carrier service in 1989, she received a 'ski jump' for more efficient use of her Sea Harriers.

''Vikrant'' was India's only carrier for over 20 years, but by the early 1990s she was effectively out of service because of her poor condition. Even following major overhauls she was rarely put to sea. She was formally decommissioned [[January 31]], [[1997]] and is preserved as a [[museum ship|museum]] at [[Mumbai]].
