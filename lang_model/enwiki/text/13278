'''Rage Against the Machine''' is an [[United States|American]] [[Rock music|rock]] band formed in {{city-state|Los Angeles|California}} in 1991. The band's continual members are [[Singer|vocalist]] [[Zack de la Rocha]], [[guitarist]] [[Tom Morello]], [[bassist]] [[Tim Commerford]] and [[drummer]] [[Brad Wilk]]. Rage Against the Machine is noted for its blend of [[hip hop music|hip hop]], [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]], [[punk rock|punk]] and [[funk]] as well as its revolutionary politics and [[lyrics]].<ref>{{cite book | last = George-Warren | first = Holly | title = The Rolling Stone Encyclopedia of Rock & Roll | publisher = Fireside | location = New York | year = 2001 | isbn = 9780743201209 }}</ref> Rage Against the Machine drew inspiration from early [[heavy metal music|metal]] instrumentation, as well as rap acts such as [[Public Enemy (band)|Public Enemy]] and [[Afrika Bambaataa]].<ref name="allmusic"/> The group's music is based primarily on de la Rocha's rhyming styles and Morello's unusual guitar techniques.

Rage Against the Machine released their debut album ''[[Rage Against the Machine (album)|Rage Against the Machine]]'' in 1992, which became a commercial success. Following a slot on the 1993 [[Lollapalooza]], the band did not release a follow-up record until ''[[Evil Empire (album)|Evil Empire]]'' in 1996. The band's third album ''[[The Battle of Los Angeles (album)|The Battle of Los Angeles]]'' was released in 1999. During their initial nine year run, they became one of the most popular and influential political bands in contemporary music.<ref name="Devenish">Devenish, Colin (2001), ''Rage Against the Machine'': [[St. Martin's Press|St. Martin's Griffin]] ISBN 0-312-27316-6</ref>

The band released their fourth studio album ''[[Renegades (album)|Renegades]]'' in 2000 and broke up shortly afterwards. Zack de la Rocha started a low-key solo career; the rest of the band formed the rock [[supergroup]] [[Audioslave]] with former [[Soundgarden]] frontman [[Chris Cornell]]. In April 2007 Rage Against the Machine performed together for the first time in seven years at the [[Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival]]. The band has continued to perform at multiple live venues since.

==History==
=== Early years (1991<U+2013>1992) ===
In 1991, guitarist [[Tom Morello]] left his old band, [[Lock Up (US band)|Lock Up]], looking to start another band.  Morello was in a club in L.A where [[Zack de la Rocha]] was free-style rapping.  Morello was impressed by de la Rocha's lyric books, and asked him to be the vocalist in a band. Morello called and drafted drummer [[Brad Wilk]], who had previously auditioned for [[Lock Up]], while de la Rocha convinced his childhood friend [[Tim Commerford]] to join as bassist. The newly christened Rage Against the Machine named themselves after a song de la Rocha had written for his former popular underground [[Hardcore punk|Hardcore]] band, [[Inside Out]] (also to be the title of the unrecorded ''[[Inside Out]]'' full-length album).<ref>Myers, Ben ([[October 16]], [[1999]]), [http://www.musicfanclubs.org/rage/articles/kerrang1099.htm Hello, Hello... ...It's Good To Be Back], ''[[Kerrang!]]''. Retrieved [[February 27]], [[2007]].</ref> [[Kent McClard]], with whom [[Inside Out]] were associated, had previously coined the phrase in a 1989 article in his [[zine]] ''[[No Answers]]''.<ref>[[Kent McClard|McClard, Kent]], [http://www.ebullition.com/catalog.html#5 History] of Ebullition Records. Retrieved [[February 19]], [[2007]]</ref>

Shortly after forming, they gave their first public performance in [[Orange County, California]], where a friend of Commerford's was holding a house party. The blueprint for the group's major-label debut album was laid on a twelve-song self-released cassette, the cover image of which was the stock-market with a single match taped to the inlay card. Not all 12 songs made it onto the final album<U+2014>two were eventually included as [[A-side and B-side|B-sides]], with the remaining three songs never seeing an official release.<ref>{{cite web | last = Woodlief | first = Mark | title = Rage Against the Machine | publisher = [[TrouserPress.com]] | url = http://www.trouserpress.com/entry.php?a=rage_against_the_machine | accessdate = 2007-01-07}}</ref>

Several record labels expressed interest, and the band eventually signed with [[Epic Records]]. Morello said, "Epic agreed to everything we asked<U+2014>and they've followed through.<U+2026> We never saw a[n] [ideological] conflict as long as we maintained creative control."<ref name="officialfaq">[http://web.archive.org/web/20060526032423/http://www.ratm.de/faq/ragefaq.html Rage Against the Machine FAQ], [[Internet Archive]] cache of FAQ on the official Rage Against the Machine website.

The band's debut album, ''[[Rage Against the Machine (album)|Rage Against the Machine]]'', reached [[RIAA certification|triple platinum]] status, driven by heavy radio play of the song "[[Killing in the Name]]", a heavy, driving track repeating six lines of lyrics. The uncensored version, which contains 17 iterations of the word ''[[fuck]]'', was once notoriously played  on the [[BBC Radio 1]] [[UK Singles Chart|Top 40 singles]] show.<ref>{{cite web | last=Robinson | first=John | date=[[January 29]], [[2000]] | title=The Revolution Will Not be Trivialised | work=[[NME]] | url=http://www.musicfanclubs.org/rage/articles/trivialized.htm | accessdate=2007-02-19}}</ref> The album's cover pictured [[Th<U+00ED>ch Qu<U+1EA3>ng <U+0110><U+1EE9>c]], a [[Vietnamese people|Vietnamese]] [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] monk, [[self-immolation|burning himself to death]] in [[Saigon]] in 1963 in protest of the murder of Buddhists by [[Prime Minister of Vietnam|Prime Minister]] [[Ngo Dinh Diem|Ng<U+00F4> <U+0110><U+00EC>nh Di<U+1EC7>m]]'s regime. To promote the album and its core message of [[social justice]] and [[Social equality|equality]], the band went on tour, playing at [[Lollapalooza]] 1993 and as support for [[Suicidal Tendencies]] in Europe.

After their debut album, the band appeared on the soundtrack for the film ''[[Higher Learning]]'' with the song "Year of tha Boomerang". An early version of "[[Tire Me]]" would also appear during the movie. Subsequently, they recorded an original song, "Darkness", for the soundtrack of ''[[The Crow (film)|The Crow]]'' and also "[[No Shelter]]" appeared on the ''[[Godzilla (1998 film)|Godzilla]]'' soundtrack.

{{sample box end}}
Rage Against The Machine's second album, ''[[Evil Empire (album)|Evil Empire]]'', entered Billboard's Top 200 chart at number one in 1996. The song "[[Bulls on Parade]]" was performed on ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' in April 1996. Their planned two-song performance was cut to one song when the band attempted to hang inverted American flags from their amplifiers (a sign of distress or great danger), a protest against having Republican presidential candidate [[Steve Forbes]] as guest host on the program that night.

In 1997, the band opened for [[U2]] on their [[PopMart Tour]], for which all Rage's profits went to support social organisations.<ref>[http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/h2g2/A730883 BBC.co.uk h2g2 entry for Rage Against the Machine]</ref> including [[Unite (trade union)|U.N.I.T.E.]] , Women Alive and the [[Zapatista Army of National Liberation|Zapatista Front for National Liberation]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.atu2.com/news/article.src?ID=997&Key=&Year=1997&Cat=2 |title=Rage Against the Machine and U2 Make a Perfect Pairing |accessdate=2007-07-11 |format=newspaper article |work=The State }}</ref> Rage subsequently began an abortive headlining US tour with special guests [[Wu-Tang Clan]].

The track "[[Calm Like a Bomb]]" was later featured in the film's sequel, 2003's ''[[The Matrix Reloaded]]''. In 2000, the band planned to support the [[Beastie Boys]] on the "Rhyme and Reason" tour; however, the tour was canceled when Beastie Boys drummer [[Mike D]] suffered a serious injury.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/jessicasimpson/articles/story/5922676/really_randoms_jessica_simpson_oasis |title=Really Randoms: Jessica Simpson, Oasis |accessdate=2007-07-11 |format=magazine article |work=[[Rolling Stone]] }}</ref>

===Break-up and subsequent projects (2000<U+2013>2006)===

On [[October 18]], [[2000]], de la Rocha released a statement announcing his departure from the band. He said, "I feel that it is now necessary to leave Rage because our decision-making process has completely failed. It is no longer meeting the aspirations of all four of us collectively as a band, and from my perspective, has undermined our artistic and political ideal."<ref name="zackquit">{{cite web | last=Armstrong | first=Mark | date=[[October 18]], 2000 | title=Zack de la Rocha Leaves Rage Against the Machine | work=[[MTV News]] | url=http://www.eonline.com/news/article/index.jsp?uuid=460baa38-4bb2-4eab-9395-22a301d24afb&entry=index | accessdate=2007-02-17}}</ref> The bands final studio album, ''[[Renegades (album)|Renegades]]'', released shortly after the band's dissolution, was a collection of [[cover version|covers]] of artists as diverse as [[Devo]], [[Cypress Hill]], [[Minor Threat]], [[MC5]], [[Bruce Springsteen]] and [[Bob Dylan]]. The following year saw the release of another live video, ''[[The Battle of Mexico City]]'', and 2003 saw the release of a [[live album]] titled ''[[Live at the Grand Olympic Auditorium]]'', an edited recording of the band's final two concerts on September 12 and 13, 2000 at the [[Grand Olympic Auditorium]] in [[Los Angeles]]. It was accompanied by an expanded [[DVD]] release of the last show, and also included the previously unreleased music video for "[[Bombtrack (song)|Bombtrack]]".
[[Image:Audioslave 2005.jpg|thumb|Wilk, Commerford and Morello performing with [[Chris Cornell]] as [[Audioslave]] at the [[Montreux Jazz Festival]] in 2005.]]
After the group's breakup, Morello, Wilk, and Commerford briefly tried to replace de la Rocha in RATM. Rumoured vocalists at the time included [[Rey Oropeza]] of [[downset.]], [[Chuck D]] of [[Public Enemy (band)|Public Enemy]], and [[B-Real]] of [[Cypress Hill]]. However, the band teamed up with former [[Soundgarden]] singer [[Chris Cornell]] to form a new band, [[Audioslave]]. The first Audioslave single, "[[Cochise (song)|Cochise]]", was released in early November 2002, and the debut album, ''[[Audioslave (album)|Audioslave]]'', followed to mainly positive reviews. Their second album ''[[Out of Exile]]'' debuted at the number one position on the Billboard charts in 2005. The band released a third album named ''[[Revelations (album)|Revelations]]'' on [[September 5]], [[2006]]. The band vowed to have a "one-album-per-year" schedule, until the departure of Chris Cornell on [[February 15]], [[2007]].<ref name="cornellquit">{{cite web | last = Harris | first = Chris | title = Chris Cornell Talks Audioslave Split, Nixes Rumors Of Soundgarden Reunion | work = [[MTV News]] |date=[[February 15]], [[2007]] | url = http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1552582/20070215/audioslave.jhtml | accessdate = 2007-02-16}}</ref>

The event led to a media furor. A clip of Zack's speech found its way to the Fox News program "Hannity & Colmes." An on-screen headline read, "Rock group Rage Against the Machine says Bush admin should be shot."

On July 28th and 29th, Rage headlined the hip hop festival [[Rock the Bells]] with the [[Wu Tang Clan]], [[Public Enemy (band)|Public Enemy]] and [[Cypress Hill]]. On [[July 28]], they made a speech during Wake Up just as they had done at Coachella. During this, De La Rocha made another statement, defending the band from [[Fox News]], who he alleged misquoted his speech at Coachella: 

{{cquote2|A couple of months ago, those fascist motherfuckers at the Fox News Network attempted to pin this band into a corner by suggesting that we said that the president should be assassinated. Nah, what we said was that he should be brought to trial as war criminal and hung and shot. THAT'S what we said. And we don't back away from the position because the real assassinator is Bush and Cheney and the whole administration for the lives they have destroyed here and in Iraq. They're the ones. And what they refused to air which was far more provocative in my mind and in the minds of my bandmates is this: this system has become so brutal and vicious and cruel that it needs to start wars and profit from the destruction around the world in order to survive as a world power. THAT's what we said. And we refuse not to stand up, we refuse to back down from that position<U+2026><ref>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMuWTsEZRLo</ref>}}

On August 24, Rage Against the Machine played their first non-festival concert in 7 years at the [[Alpine Valley Music Theater]] in [[East Troy]], [[Wisconsin]], with support act [[Queens of the Stone Age]]. During the show, De La Rocha made a speech similar to the one at the [[Rock the Bells]] festival in July. On October 26, Rage co-headlined at [[New Orleans]]'s [[Voodoo Music Experience]]. During Wake Up, de la Rocha gave a speech saying he went through the New Orleans communities, including the [[9th Ward]].

On December 13th 2007, it was also announced that Rage Against The Machine will be headlining the Optimus Alive!08 Festival in [[Portugal]].

When asked in May 2007 if the band were planning on writing a new album, Morello replied:

{{Quote|There are no plans to do that<U+2026> That's a whole other ball of wax right there. Writing and recording albums is a whole different thing than getting back on the bike (laughs), you know, and playing these songs. But I think that the one thing about the [[Rage Against the Machine discography|Rage catalog]] is that to me none of it feels dated. You know, it doesn't feel at all like a nostalgia show.

== Political views and activism==
[[Image:RATM - Burningamp.jpg|thumb|right|RATM [[flag desecration|burning]] the [[flag of the United States]] at [[Woodstock 1999]]]]
Integral to their identity as a band, Rage Against the Machine voice [[revolution]]ary viewpoints highly critical of the domestic and foreign policies of the U.S. Throughout its existence, RATM and its individual members participated in political [[protest]]s and other [[activism]] to advocate these beliefs.  The band primarily saw its music as a vehicle for [[social activism]]; de la Rocha explained that "I'm interested in spreading those ideas through art, because music has the power to cross borders, to break military sieges and to establish real dialogue."<ref name="Juice">Wooldridge, Simon (February 2000), "[http://musicfanclubs.org/rage/articles/juice00.htm Fight the Power]", ''[[Juice Magazine]]''. Retrieved October 6, 2007.</ref> Morello said of [[wage slavery]] in America:

{{cquote2|America touts itself as the land of the free, but the number one freedom that you and I have is the freedom to enter into a subservient role in the workplace. Once you exercise this freedom you've lost all control over what you do, what is produced, and how it is produced. And in the end, the product doesn't belong to you.  The only way you can avoid bosses and jobs is if you don't care about making a living. Which leads to the second freedom: the freedom to starve.|Tom Morello|''[[Guitar World]]''<ref>Young, Charles M. (February 1997), [http://www.musicfanclubs.org/rage/articles/guitaryear.htm Tom Morello: Artist of the Year interview], ''[[Guitar World]]''. Retrieved [[February 17]], [[2007]].</ref>}}

Meanwhile, detractors pointed out the tension between voicing commitment to leftist causes while being signed to [[Epic Records]], a [[subsidiary]] of media conglomerate [[Sony Records]]. [[Infectious Grooves]] released a song called "Do What I Tell Ya!" which mocks lyrics from "Killing in the Name",  accusing the band of being hypocrites. In response to such critiques, Morello offered the rebuttal:

{{cquote|When you live in a [[capitalism|capitalistic]] society, the currency of the dissemination of information goes through capitalistic channels. Would [[Noam Chomsky]] object to his works being sold at [[Barnes & Noble]]? No, because that's where people buy their books. We're not interested in preaching to just the converted. It's great to play abandoned [[squatting|squats]] run by [[anarchism|anarchists]], but it's also great to be able to reach people with a revolutionary message, people from [[Granada Hills]] to [[Stuttgart]].<ref name="officialfaq"/>}}

=== EZLN ===
[[Image:Flag of the EZLN.svg|thumb|right|The "black flag and a red star" of the [[Zapatista Army of National Liberation]] as referenced in the track "War Within a Breath" (1999)]]
The band are vocal supporters of the [[Zapatista Army of National Liberation]] (EZLN), especially de la Rocha, who has taken several trips to the [[Mexico|Mexican]] state of [[Chiapas]] to aid their efforts. The flag of the EZLN serves as the primary recurring theme in the band's visual art. Morello described the EZLN as "a guerrilla army who represent the poor indigenous communities in southern Mexico who, for hundreds of years, have been trodden upon and sort of cast aside and which really are the lowest form on the economic -social ladder in Mexico. In 1994, on New Years Day, there was an uprising there and they were led by the very charismatic [[Subcomandante Marcos]] and it's a group which is tremendously supportive of the most objectively poor and continues to fight for dignity, for all people in Mexico."<ref>[http://musicfanclubs.org/rage/articles/jjj.htm Tom Morello interview] on [[Triple J]], October 31, 1999.</ref> An interviewer was once told by de la Rocha, "Our purpose in sympathising with the Zapatistas is to help spark [real] dialogue."<ref name="Juice"/>

De la Rocha, while known for shying from the media, has been particularly outspoken on the cause of the EZLN. He explained the importance of the cause to him personally:

{{cquote2|It is important for me, as a popular artist, to make clear to the governments of the United States and Mexico that despite the strategy of fear and intimidation to foreigners, despite their weapons, despite their immigration laws and military reserves, they will never be able to isolate the Zapatista communities from the people in the United States... Through concerts, videos, interviews, broadcasting of information at concerts, and our songs' lyrics we have placed within reach of young people, our audience, the experiences of the Zapatistas; we act as facilitators of the ways in which they can participate and put them in contact with the organization and the Zapatista support committees in the United States.<ref name="chiapas">"[http://www.musicfanclubs.org/rage/articles/chiapas.htm Interview with Zack from Chiapas]" (July 19, 1998), ''Accion Zapatista de Austin''. Retrieved October 6, 2007.</ref>}}

De la Rocha made four trips to Chiapas in order to aid the EZLN. His first was in an observatory team monitoring negotiation between the EZLN and the Mexican government. At one point de la Rocha and others in the team  formed a human chain to protect the EZLN from potential threats.<ref name="rolstone">Rricke, David (November 25, 1999),"[http://www.musicfanclubs.org/rage/articles/rs99.htm The Battles of Rage Against the Machine]", ''[[Rolling Stone]]''. Retrieved October 6, 2007.</ref>

His second trip, in February 1996, was to peace campaign camps in La Garrucha. de la Rocha said of the experience:
{{cquote2|There, I experienced the terror and the intimidation to the integrity of the people by the soldiers; the isolation in which the communities had to subsist; the military camps located between the houses and the fields, I understood then that one of the great missions of a low intensity war is to wear out the people through hunger and to create lack of goods. That starvation practice against the people has the same effect as throwing bombs on the population, but is more comfortable for the rulers because it maintains Mexico as a stable place and as a suitable place for financial investments and it doesn't place the Free Trade Agreement at risk.

We were witness of that, we saw how the soldiers burned and razed the fields, threw the children out of schools, and turned the latter into barracks... and each time we became more familiar with the Zapatistas' form of organization, communal work and cooperation. And I realized that the intentions behind the militarization were to break down the community, to keep the people from organizing in an autonomous manner in order to overcome poverty and isolation.<ref name="chiapas"/>}}

Later in 1996, de la Rocha led an educational trip for young students, artists and activists from L.A. to Chiapas.

The EZLN and de la Rocha's experiences with them inspired the songs "Wind Below", and "Without A Face" from ''Evil Empire''<ref name="chiapas"/> and "Calm Like a Bomb", "War Within a Breath" and "Maria" from ''The Battle of Los Angeles''<ref name="rolstone"/>

===Saturday Night Live censorship===
On April 10th, 1996 the band was scheduled to perform two songs on the [[NBC]] comedy variety show ''[[Saturday Night Live]]''. The show was hosted that night by ex-[[Republican Party (U.S.)|Republican]] presidential candidate and billionaire [[Steve Forbes]]. According to an unidentified RATM member, "RATM wanted to stand in sharp juxtaposition to a billionaire telling jokes and promoting his [[flat tax]] by making our own statement."<ref name="SNL">Anon., [http://www.musicfanclubs.org/rage/snl.htm Saturday Nigt Live Incident], Public release and distribution. Retrieved November 12, 2007.</ref>

To this end, the band hung two upside-down [[Flag of the United States|American flags]] from their amplifiers. Seconds before they took the stage to perform "[[Bulls on Parade]]", SNL and NBC sent stagehands in to pull the flags down. The inverted flags, says Morello, represented: {{cquote2|Our contention that American democracy is inverted when what passes for democracy is an electoral choice between two representatives of the privileged class. America's [[freedom of expression]] is inverted when you're free to say anything you want to say until it upsets a corporate sponsor. Finally, this was our way of expressing our opinion of the show's host, Steve Forbes.<ref name="SNL"/>}}

The band's first attempt to hang the flags during a pre-telecast rehearsal on Thursday were frustrated by SNL's producers, who "demanded that we take the flags down," according to Morello, "They said the sponsors would be upset, and that because Steve Forbes was on, they had to run a 'tighter' show." SNL also told the band it would mute objectionable lyrics in "[[Bullet in the Head (song)|Bullet in the Head]]" (which was supposed to be RATM's second song), and insisted that the song be bleeped in the studio because Forbes had friends and family there.<ref name="SNL"/>

On the night of the show, following the removal of the flags during the first performance, the band were approached by SNL and NBC officials and ordered to immediately leave the building. Upon hearing this, RATM bassist Commerford reportedly stormed Forbes' dressing room, throwing shreds from one of the torn down flags.
{{cquote2|SNL censored Rage, period. They could not have sucked up to the billionaire more. The thing that's ironic is SNL is supposedly this cutting edge show, but they proved they're bootlickers to their corporate masters when it comes down to it. They're cowards. It should come to no surprise that [[General Electric|GE]], which owns NBC, would find "Bullet" particularly offensive. GE is a major manufacturer of US planes used to commit war crimes in the [[Gulf War]], and bombs from those jets destroyed [[hydroelectric dam]]s which killed thousands of civilians in [[Iraq]].|Tom Morello}}
Morello noted that members of the Saturday Night Live cast and crew, whom he declined to name, "[e]xpressed solidarity with our actions, and a sense of shame that their show had censored the performance."<ref name="SNL"/>

=== Radio Free L.A. ===
''Radio Free Los Angeles'' was a radio show held by the band on [[January 20]], [[1997]], the night of [[Inauguration Day|Bill Clinton's inauguration]] as [[President of the United States|President]].<ref>http://www.mediacast.com/Calendar/97-01-20/Radio_Free_L.A./</ref> The show comprised segments and interviews featuring [[Michael Moore]], [[Emily Hodgson]], [[Leonard Peltier]], [[Chuck D]], [[Mumia Abu-Jamal]], [[UNITE]], [[Noam Chomsky]], [[Amy Ray]] of the [[Indigo Girls]], and [[Subcomandante Marcos]] of the Zapatistas.<ref name="rfla">[http://www.ratm.com/new2/radiofree.html Radio Free L.A.] at RATM.com]</ref> These were intercut with musical performances by [[Beck]], [[Cypress Hill]], [[Flea]], [[Stephen Perkins]] as well as members of Rage. The band organized the show in response to the [[United States presidential election, 1996|re-election of Clinton]]:

{{Quote|That election had resulted in one of the lowest voter turnouts in the history of the country, as more and more Americans came to realize that their government was not in their hands, but in the hands of big business. Radio Free L.A. provided a musical and political gathering point for the majority of Americans<U+2014>and young people especially<U+2014>who rightly felt left out of the "democratic process."|[[Tom Morello]]|''Ratm.com''<ref name="rfla"/>}}

The two-hour show was syndicated by over 50 commercial U.S. radio stations<ref name="timeline">[http://www.ratm.com/new2/timeline/index.html Official RATM timeline] at [http://www.ratm.com ratm.com].</ref> and streamed live from the band's website.

==="Sleep Now in the Fire" video shoot===

On [[January 26]], [[2000]], filming of the [[music video]] for "[[Sleep Now in the Fire]]", which was directed by [[Michael Moore]], caused the doors of the [[New York Stock Exchange]] to be closed and the band to be escorted from the site by security,<ref name="greenleft">{{cite web | date=March 15, 2000 | title=Rage against Wall Street | work=[[Green Left Weekly]] ''#397''<nowiki></nowiki> | url=http://www.greenleft.org.au/2000/397/24186 | accessdate=2007-10-11}}</ref> after band members attempted to gain entry into the Exchange<ref>{{cite web | last=Basham | first=David | date=[[January 28]], [[2000]] | title=Rage Against the Machine Shoots New Video With Michael Moore | work=[[MTV News]] | url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1433553/20000128/rage_against_the_machine.jhtml | accessdate=2007-02-17}}</ref>.
