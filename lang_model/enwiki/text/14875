'''Raffles Institution ''' is an independent school comprising an all-boys' [[secondary education|Secondary]] section and a [[co-educational]] [[Raffles Junior College|Junior College]] section. It is the oldest school in Singapore. Founded in 1823 as '''Singapore Institution''' by Sir [[Thomas Stamford Raffles]], it is consistently ranked as one of the top secondary schools in Singapore in the now-defunct official school rankings released by the [[Ministry of Education (Singapore)|Ministry of Education]]. RI has received the top award of MOE's Masterplan of Awards, the School Excellence Award.<ref>[http://www.moe.gov.sg/press/2004/pr2004sea_sda.htm School Excellence Award (SEA), Ministry of Education, 2006.]</ref>..

Raffles Institution offers the [[Education in Singapore#Integrated Programme|Integrated Programme]], also known as the [[Raffles Programme]] (RP), together with [[Raffles Girls' School (Secondary)]] and [[Raffles Junior College|Raffles Institution (Junior College)]].<ref>[http://raffles.sg/rp_ov.htm Raffles Programme, 2006.]</ref> It used to offer a school based [[Gifted Education Programme (Singapore)|Gifted Education Programme]] (SBGE), but the GEP stream merged with the Special/Express Stream into a single stream in 2007. A new programme, the Raffles Academy, was also introduced.

In October 2008 a proposed merger of RI and RJC was announced and approved by the MOE. Raffles Institution and Raffles Junior College have come together to form a single institution with effect from 1 January 2009, under the name Raffles Institution. Their academic curricula remain separate; the merger involves the schools' administrative and corporate functions. A common Board of Governors for Raffles Institution and Raffles Junior College has been set up, with one-third drawn from the Raffles Girls' School (RGS) Board of Governors. RGS had declined to take part in the merger, as its students "thrive best in an all-girls environment, where they would be more adventurous and take up leadership positions without being diffident."<ref>[http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/view/382479/1/.html "RI, RJC to merge next year; new school will be Raffles Institution"], ''Channel NewsAsia'', 13 October 2008.</ref>

The Principal of RI is Mrs. Lim (n<U+00E9>e Tay) Lai Cheng, who, as the former Principal of RJC, took up the post after the merger between RI and RJC in 2009. The merger makes the combined institution the largest school in Singapore, with 4,600 students.<ref>[http://newpaper.asia1.com.sg/printfriendly/0,4139,180104,00.html "RI gets its first female principal"], ''The New Paper'', Singapore, 15 October 2008.</ref>

== History ==
[[Image:RafflesInstitution.jpg|thumb|right|An undated photo of the original Raffles Institution building at the junction of [[Bras Basah]] and [[Beach Road]] (the site diagonally opposite SAF Warrant Officers and Specialists Club building)]]
[[Image:Raffles Institution bust.jpg|thumb|right|Sir Stamford Raffles bust at the Raffles Institution (Secondary) Main Atrium]]
Founded by Sir Thomas Stamford Raffles in June 1823, Raffles Institution is the oldest school in Singapore. Raffles had secured a grant from the [[British East India Company]], drafted the curriculum and set up the structure for the [[board of trustees]]. His goal was to provide education for the sons of the Company's servants and the children of local leaders in the new British colony of Singapore.<ref name="ReferenceA">E. Wijeysingha et al., The Eagle Breeds a Gryphon, Chapter 1-11, 2003</ref> The original campus of Raffles Institution was located along [[Bras Basah Road]], where [[Raffles City|Raffles City Shopping Centre]] now stands. The Bras Basah campus's library building is featured on the $2 paper and polymer bill in the Singapore legal tender.<ref>[http://www.mas.gov.sg/currency/currency_info/notes/portrait_series/Singapore_Circulation_Notes_Portrait_Series__2.html "MAS:Currency Services, Currency Information"], [[Monetary Authority of Singapore]], 2006.</ref>

In March 1972 the school was relocated to [[Grange Road]]. In 1990 it moved again to its current site at [[Bishan]] in [[Central Region, Singapore|central Singapore]].

RI's alumni body, the Old Rafflesians Association (ORA), is noted for its participation in Singapore's political scene. This includes Minister Mentor [[Lee Kuan Yew]], Senior Minister [[Goh Chok Tong]] and three former presidents of Singapore.<ref>[http://www.rafflesian.com/index.asp?module=mod_content&menu=2&maincatid=15&categoryid=15&contentid=&action=browse&type= "Honorary Members - Old Rafflesians' Association, Old Rafflesians' Association, 2005.]</ref>

Lee Kuan Yew wrote about his time at RI in the 1930s in ''The Singapore Story'' and this section of the book is available on line.<ref name="timeasia"/>

The history of Raffles Institution is documented in the book ''The Eagle Breeds a Gryphon'', written by a former headmaster, Eugene Wijeysingha. The original edition documents the school's history till 1985, while the latest includes events up to 2003. While the original edition was not titled ''The Eagle Breeds a Gryphon'', the title caught on from the second edition onwards.

== Symbols ==
[[Image:Raffles Institution Admin Block.jpg|thumb|right|The Secondary campus]]
=== Institution anthem ===
For more than a century since its founding, Raffles Institution had no school song.. The Institution Anthem, ''Auspicium Melioris <U+00C6>vi'', was written by E.W. Jesudason, the Headmaster from 1963 to 1966. 

Despite references to [[Prometheus]] and [[God]] in the Institution Anthem, the school is [[secular]]. The inclusion of Prometheus is due to the literary [[allusion]] to passing the torch, signifying the importance of education while 'God' in this context is a historical legacy of the school's British roots.

'''The Institution Anthem'''

When Stamford Raffles held the torch<br/>
That cast Promethean Flame<br/>
We faced the challenge of the day<br/>
To give our school a name

The eagle eye and gryphon strength<br/>
They led us to the fore<br/>
To reign supreme in ev'ry sphere<br/>
The sons of Singapore

Come heed the call Rafflesians all<br/>
And let our hearts be stirring<br/>
We'll do our best whate<U+2019>the the test<br/>
And keep our colours flying

Let comradeship and fervent hope<br/>
With one voice make us pray<br/>
Auspicium Melioris Aevi<br/>
With God to guide the way.

=== Coat of arms ===
[[Image:Raffles Institution Coat of Arms.png|thumb|right|Raffles Institution Corporate Badge]]
The school badge is a modified version of the [[Stamford Raffles#Coat of Arms|Raffles coat of arms]]. It replaces the original [[Or (heraldry)|gold]] portion of the [[division of the field|field]] with [[erminois]], and the [[purpure]] of the [[griffin|gryphon]] [[Crest (heraldry)|crest]] with [[gules]] . 

The [[griffin|gryphon]] on the [[crest (heraldry)|crest]] symbolises stability and success. The gryphon's lower lion half symbolises the school's roots in Singapore. The double-headed [[eagle]] on the shield signifies looking back to the past and forward to the future. It also indicates universality - looking to the [[East]] as well as the [[West]].

The school motto, "Auspicium Melioris <U+00C6>vi", is displayed in black on gold at the base of the shield. While the school's official translation is "Hope of a Better Age",<ref>See e.g. ''One Man's Vision: Raffles Institution in Focus'' (1992): "Hope of a Better Age, the school motto, is the vision perceived by Raffles Institution, a perception every Rafflesian hopes to achieve for the future."</ref> this is a mistranslation. ''Auspicium'' primarily means an [[auspice|augury]] or auspice, which is a [[divination|divinatory omen]] derived by an [[augur]] from watching the flight of birds.<ref>[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0059%3Aentry%3D%234612 Charlton T. Lewis, Charles Short, ''A Latin Dictionary''.]</ref> It may, in a transferative sense, mean ''omen'', ''token'' or ''sign'', but not ''hope''. It is also the motto of the [[Order of St Michael and St George]].

The two medallions on the crest were presented to Sir Stamford Raffles by a Javanese prince.  The message inscribed in Arabic is <U+201C>The Order of Golden Sword. They were incorporated into the crest in recognition of the services of Sir Stamford Raffles to the British Empire in the East.


== Awards ==
The school was awarded the School Excellence Award in 2004, the top [[Ministry of Education (Singapore)|MOE]] award.<ref>[http://app.sis.moe.gov.sg/schinfo/SIS_SearchDtls.asp?strCode=3009 Ministry of Education, 2006.]</ref> Other awards include:
*Singapore Quality Class (2004)
*National Arts Education Gold Award (2004)
*Cherish Gold Award (2004)
*Partners Outstanding Award (2004)
*Awards in the MOE masterplan
**School Excellence Award (2004-2008)
**School Distinction Award (2004-2008)
**Best Practice Awards
***[[Aesthetics]]
***Physical Fitness
***[[Sports]]
***[[Uniformed group|Uniformed Groups]]
**Outstanding Development Award for Character Development

== Culture ==
=== Uniform ===
Lower secondary students wear a white short-sleeved shirt, white short trousers and white socks. After the OBS camp at the start of the Secondary 3 year, upper secondary students may continue in short pants or opt for white long trousers.

School ties are worn on Mondays and for functions and ceremonies. Shoes are at least 70% white for all students, except upper secondary [[Prefects#Academic|prefects]] who wear black shoes. 

Teachers have a [[Academic dress#Gown|formal gown]] for special occasions such as the Principal's Assembly, when the Principal delivers her termly address.

=== Orientation camp ===
The new intake of Secondary One students go through an orientation camp, which lasts three days. Secondary Four Peer Support Leaders (PSLs) guide them through this camp as well as the rest of the orientation period. At the end of the camp, the Secondary 1s receive their school badges in the formal Junior Rafflesian Investiture Ceremony (JRIC). 

Each batch of students also a batch song, which they will pass down to their Secondary 1 juniors as Secondary 4 students. As a result, the Secondary Four and Secondary One students of any year share the same batch song. The three batch songs are:

* [[Hand In Hand]] - an adaptation of the Seoul [[1988 Summer Olympics]] theme song
* [[Voices That Care]] - an adaptation of the [[Gulf War]] song
* [[We Are The Young]] - by Mary Donnelly

=== OBS camp ===
At the beginning of every year, all Secondary Three students undergo a five-day [[Outward Bound Singapore|Outward Bound]] course in [[Pulau Ubin]]. After the camp, these students are recognised as seniors of the secondary section, and may opt to switch to the long-trousers uniform. This practice used to comprise a separate orientation camp for the students, who then attended OBS at a later date.

=== Prefectorial Board ===
[[Image:Raffles Institution Prefectorial Board logo.png|thumb|right|Raffles Institution Prefectorial Board logo.]]
The Raffles Institution Prefectorial Board (RIPB) is split into Welfare, Communications, Human Resource, Discipline and the Gryphon's Committee, which organises match supports. Prefects are nominated by students and teachers, and voted on to the Prefectorial board by the school population.

In addition to helping maintain order in the school, the Board organises activities, ranging from interest groups to formal occasions and Rafflesian Spotlight, an intra-school performing arts competition. The Board also organizes Community Involvement Programmes, to help the less fortunate members of both the public and the school. In 2005 the Board raised S$40,000 to buy a van for use by the handicapped at a Voluntary Welfare Organization, as well as co-organizing a Guinness record-breaking attempt with Dr. William Tan, in aid of the Cancer Foundation.

=== Class Executive Committee (CEC) ===
Every class in Raffles Institution has its own Class Executive Committee (CEC). This consists of three students: Monitor, Assistant Monitor (or Secretary) and Treasurer. Often, students vote for classmates to take up these positions, but some Form Teachers may choose to select students themselves.

The CEC Council is made up of representatives from each level. These representatives are nominated and voted by all the CEC members in their respective level. It works closely with RIPB to organize events. It also organizes inter-class events, such as the inter-class classroom decoration competition and the inter-class soccer tournament.

=== Houses ===
The five houses, three of which are named after former headmasters, are Bayley, Buckley, Hullett, Moor and Morrison, represented by the colours yellow, green, black, red and blue respectively.

* J.H. Moor was the first Headmaster of the school
* R.W. Hullett was the Raffles Institution's longest-serving principal.
* J.B. Bayley was a Headmaster who "raised Raffles Institution to a large and flourishing establishment", as recorded by the Board of Trustees<ref>[http://www.ri.sch.edu.sg/en/co-curricular-activity/bayley.html Bayley House page], Raffles Institution.</ref>.
* [[Robert Morrison (missionary)|Reverend Robert Morrison]] was the co-founder of Raffles Institution.
* C.B. Buckley was the Secretary to the Board of Trustees of Raffles Institution.

Secondary One students are sorted into houses by class. The results from interhouse sports and academic competitions are summed up in a yearly points system.  

In the early years of RI's history, there were ten houses, including a sixth Philips house (purple), which were later disbanded. House allocations used to be student-based, instead of class-based.

=== The Rafflesian Principle of Honour ===
The Principle of Honour is:

"In intellectual pursuit, I shall reflect discipline and passion for learning and in personal conduct, I shall live in integrity and regard individuals, groups and the community with kindness and respect, and in so doing, uphold the Rafflesian Principle of Honour."

===Discipline===
In Minister Mentor Lee Kuan Yew's book ''The Singapore Story'',<ref name="timeasia">[http://www.time.com/time/asia/asia/magazine/1998/980921/lee_kuan_yew.html "The Singapore Story"], ''Time Asia'', Hong Kong, 21 September 1998.</ref> he mentions being caned for chronic lateness in the 1930s by the then headmaster, D.W. McLeod.

In 1956 a former RI prefect wrote that, during his time there, "boys were caned on their bottoms for even winking at the girls. We did have very good discipline in our time and the boys became good citizens, lawyers, doctors, etc."<ref>[http://www.corpun.com/sgsc5610.htm "A bit of discipline is good for boys"], ''Straits Times'', Singapore, 8 October 1956.</ref>

The school still maintains strong discipline with a strict set of rules and regulations.<ref>[http://www.ri.sch.edu.sg/en/files/13/School%20Rules.pdf RI School Rules.]</ref> Disciplinary measures are based on a demerit points system. All students are liable to receive [[School corporal punishment|corporal punishment]] in the form of [[Caning in Singapore|caning]] when necessary<U+2014>very occasionally even publicly (i.e. in presence of the other students) in serious cases.<ref>See e.g. [http://www.corpun.com/sgs00509.htm#16747 "Student defames teacher on top school's online forum - Student gets publicly caned"], ''The New Paper'', 28 September 2005.</ref>

== Affiliation ==
[[Image:Common Driveway by RI and RJC at Bishan Campus.jpg|thumb|right|The common driveway of Raffles Institution and Raffles Institution (Junior College) in their Bishan campuses]]

Since 2005, prior to the merger in 2009, the campuses of both the former Raffles Institution and Raffles Junior College have been co-housed in [[Bishan]] side-by-side and run on an open campus concept, so that students of both sections can access both campuses. They share a main gate at Bishan Street 21. Students from the Secondary section use the facilities in the Junior College section for purposes such as PE lessons, CCAs and major lectures.

RI is affiliated with [[Raffles Girls' School (Secondary)]] (RGS), and the two schools undertake joint activities such as concerts and overseas learning journeys.

== Co-curricular activities ==
Raffles Institution has a [[Co-curricular activity]] (CCA) programme, with about fifty CCAs, consisting of sports groups, uniformed groups, musical groups, clubs and societies.<ref>[http://www.ri.sch.edu.sg/school_information/index.html "Raffles Institution - School Information"], Raffles Institution, 26 November 2005.</ref>

CCAs are categorised as either core or merit CCAs. Core CCAs comprise all sports, uniformed groups and musical groups, while merit CCAs consist of clubs and societies. Every student of the school takes up at least one core CCA. Merit CCAs are optional, but students are encouraged to take up at least one merit CCA to supplement their core CCA. Certain merit CCAs, such as the Infocomm Club and Raffles Debaters, however, may substitute for a core CCA instead. 

The school's sports teams and uniformed groups have earned top places in many national inter-school competitions, doing well in [[National Cadet Corps (Singapore)|NCC]], [[Floorball]], [[Red Cross]], [[Boys' Brigade]], and [[Cross country running|cross-country]] among others.<ref>[http://www.ri.sch.edu.sg/achievements/sports_and_games/index.html "2005 Sports & Games Achievements"], Raffles Institution, 2005-2006.</ref><ref>[http://www.ri.sch.edu.sg/achievements/uniformed_groups/index.html "2005 Achievements by Uniformed Groups"], Raffles Institution, 26 November 2005.</ref> 

The performing arts groups have also done well in the [[Singapore Youth Festival]] Central Judging, held once every two years,<ref>[http://www.ri.sch.edu.sg/achievements/music_drama_and_aesthetics/index.html "2005 Achievements by Music, Drama & Aesthetics Groups"], Raffles Institution, 2005-2006.</ref> while the clubs and societies have also won awards.<ref>[http://www.ri.sch.edu.sg/achievements/academic_competition/index.html "2005 Academic Competition Achievements"], Raffles Institution, 2005-2006.</ref>

RI has not offered football for many years, and there has recently been some criticism that the school has not re-introduced it now that more facilities are available.<ref>[http://newpaper.asia1.com.sg/printfriendly/0,4139,190351,00.html "No space, no soccer"], ''The New Paper'', Singapore, 20 January 2009.</ref>

=== Scout Groups ===
[[Image:02 Raffles Scout Group.jpg|thumb|Logo 02 Raffles Scout Group]]
Raffles Institution was the first school in Singapore to establish a [[Scout troop]].<ref>[http://www.scout.org.sg/company_profile/history.htm The Singapore Scout Association - History of Scouting].</ref>

The 02 Raffles Scout Group was founded in 1922. Then called the Second Singapore Scout Troop, 02 became the oldest surviving scout troop of [[The Singapore Scout Association]] after the First Singapore Scout Troop disbanded. The current membership stands at 84. The Group's alumni include Singapore's Senior Minister [[Goh Chok Tong]], Professor [[Tommy Koh]], Professor [[Lim Pin]], and Dr [[Tan Cheng Bok]].

The 01 Raffles Scout Group was founded in 1934. It was formerly known as the 32nd Raffles/2101 Raffles Scout Troop. It celebrated its 75th Anniversary with a camp fire at Sarimbun. It has produced senior civil servants, businessmen, and active scouters who continue to serve the Singapore Scouts Association.

=== Student Interest Groups ===
In 2004, Student Interest Groups (SIGs) were introduced by the Prefectorial Board. These were defined as interest groups formed by students themselves. However, SIGs are not considered to be CCAs and do not receive school funding like CCAs do. Also, as with members of Merit CCAs, students are still required to take up at least one core CCA.

Many of the original SIGs no longer exist. Exceptions include the Raffles Institution Student Entrepreneurship (RI$E) SIG, which has been successful in nationwide competitions, the Raffles Institution Fish SIG{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}, as well as the [[Aviation]] SIG, which won the 1st National Air Championship in November 2005 and November 2006.{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}}

Co-founded by Dr [[Lim Boon Keng]] and Sir [[Song Ong Siang]], it was named after Raffles Institution's longest-serving principal, [[Mr R. W. Hullett]], in 1923. The Library's opening also marked the centenary of the founding of the Institution. <ref>[http://www.ri.sch.edu.sg/houses_and_pupil_activities/service/hullett/history/index.html The History of The Hullett Memorial Library].</ref>. The Library traces its roots to the founding of the Institution, making it the oldest library in Singapore.<ref>"From Books to Bytes - The story of the National Library", [[National Library Board]], 2006.</ref><ref>E. Wijeysingha et al., "The Eagle Breeds a Gryphon", Raffles Institution, 1989.</ref> In fact, the origins of Singapore's [[National Library Board|National Library]] lie in the HML.<ref>[http://infopedia.nlb.gov.sg/articles/SIP_696_2005-01-19.html "The Singapore Institution Library"], National Library Board, Singapore, 4 November 2002.</ref>

The library possesses around 50,000 books in four different languages (excluding the few books on French, German, and other languages), and around 40 computers with [[wireless]] internet access. It employs full-time staff for administrative purposes, and other tasks are performed by the members of the Hullett Memorial Library Club as well as parent [[volunteer]]s. The HML was designed with the era of Sir Stamford Raffles in mind, so the furniture in the library is custom-made in the [[Regency architecture|Regency]] style of that time.

=== Sports facilities ===
Raffles Institution offers sports facilities, including an [[Olympic-size swimming pool]]. 

The former 400-metre track and field was replaced by a [[rugby union]] field and a [[softball]] diamond during the school's upgrading works in 2006. The last major event held on the track was a [[Guinness Book of Records|Guinness World Record]] attempt by Dr William Tan, a wheelchair-using old Rafflesian who embarked on a 24-hour ultramarathon on 30 and 31 July 2005, and beat the old record of 181.2&nbsp;km with his 242.8&nbsp;km.

Raffles Institution has a gymnasium on the 2nd level of the ArtSpace housing the [[judo]] dojo, [[table tennis]] training area, a gymnastics training area and a rock [[wall]]. Behind the ArtSpace is the Hong Leong Swimming Complex, an Olympic-sized swimming pool. The school also has two [[tennis]] courts, two [[basketball]] courts, and two [[squash (sport)|squash]] courts, and is one of the few schools in Singapore to have two [[cricket]] nets. 

There is an artificial turf known as the [[Astroturf]]. It previously served as the Parade Square and was a bare concrete surface until the artificial turf was installed around 1995. It was used for school assembly in the morning, and later in the day for [[field hockey|hockey]] training and for individual sports and games, until upgrading works in 2006. Since upgrading works in 2006 were completed, morning assemblies are held at a new area called the Raffles Square, which previously was a carpark. The Astroturf is used by students to play soccer and during school-organized Soccer Leagues. The Astroturf underwent renovation in February 2008 and was reopened on 17 May 2008, during the school's annual Open House.

Following the merger with Raffles Junior College from 2009, more sports facilities are available. Floorball, table tennis, judo and gymnastics are RI sports now benefiting from being able to use the RI(JC) facilities.<ref>Lim Say Heng, [http://newpaper.asia1.com.sg/printfriendly/0,4139,190349,00.html "But other sports benefit from merger"], ''The New Paper'', Singapore, 20 January 2009.</ref>

=== Boarding Complex ===
[[Image:Riboardingcomplex.jpg|thumb|right|The 13-storey twin towers next to the boarding complex]]
Raffles Institution has a Boarding Complex consisting of five blocks. These are named after the five Houses; Bayley, Buckley, Hullett, Moor and Morrison. Each block, apart from the new Hullett block, can accommodate 90 pupils. All blocks have their own staff, and the Boarding Complex is overseen by a Boarding Master.

The foundation stone of the Boarding Complex was laid by [[Senior Minister]] [[Lee Kuan Yew]] on 25 March 1994. The first batch of boarders moved into the Complex in 1995.

During the upgrading works in 2006, the former Moor block was demolished to make way for a 13-storey twin tower hostel, the Hullett block, which was completed in July 2007<ref name="Raffles Institution - Hot News"/>. The former Hullett block was renamed Moor and caters to girls.

Boarders consist of local Raffles Institution pupils and scholars from other countries (mostly China and [[ASEAN]] countries), as well as pupils from other [[secondary school]]s and [[junior college]]s. Boarding is mandatory for CCA leaders as a residential component of the Raffles Leadership Programme. Boarding traditions include quarterly formal dinners, as well as an orientation programme for newcomers.

=== IT facilities ===
The school has six general-purpose computer labs, one music studio with [[ProdiKeys]], one Internet Lab for the study of [[local area network|LAN]] connections, and one X-lab, short for Experimental Lab for research in computer studies. Connectivity is supplied to all buildings by the campus [[local area network|LAN]], with additional [[Wi-Fi|wireless access]] covering most areas such as the Administrative Block, the Hullett Memorial Library (HML) and the S. Rajaratnam Block. Tablet PCs are supplied by the IT department to facilitate the use of [[electronic learning|eLearning]] in a classroom setting.

Previously, the first week of the second term of the academic year had been dedicated to eLearning. During this week, lessons and materials would be disseminated online for students to study at their own pace, and students were not required to attend school. The programme was initiated in 1999 but scrapped in 2006. Since then, e-learning has been integrated into the school calendar. It is often used by teachers during holidays during term time, for instance on Staff Training Days during term time when students are not required to attend lessons; instead, teachers attend courses held in the campus.

== Raffles Academy ==
The Raffles Academy (RA), implemented in 2007, is a programme for students with higher capabilities in specific subjects, with a curriculum pitched at a deeper level compared with the Raffles Programme. During the academic periods, RA students leave their normal classes to join a special pull-out class. Additionally, compulsory extra classes are held once every three weeks on Thursdays. The subjects available are [[History]], [[Geography]], [[Mathematics]], [[Biology]], [[Chemistry]], [[Physics]], [[Literature]] and [[Music]].

At Secondary 2, students can apply for RA through online registration, followed by submission of portfolio of achievements, selection tests and interviews, before they are identified for RA. Minimum requirements for application include a minimum [[Grade Point Average]] of 3.60, and an 85th [[percentile]] rank in the cohort for the subject in question. At present the RA programme is available only to upper secondary students; however, there is an ongoing review to introduce it to lower secondary students in the near future{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}. Each student is allowed to take a maximum of two RA subjects, to allow students to focus their time and effort on subjects they are truly passionate about<ref>[http://www.ri.sch.edu.sg/ra/about_faqs.html Raffles Academy website].</ref>.

The Academy is managed by the Dean of Raffles Academy, Mrs Theresa Lai.

The Raffles Academy has also been initiated in the Junior College in 2009 so that there is a continuation of the curriculum, though students who wish to continue taking RA for subjects in RI(JC) will have to sit for a separate placement test at the end of Secondary Four<ref>Lin Yanqin,[http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/view/320809/1/.html "Raffles Junior College is introducing its own diploma"], ''Today'', Singapore, 5 January 2008.</ref>.
