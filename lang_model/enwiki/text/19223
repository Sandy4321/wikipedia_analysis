"'''Peacock'''" is a song by American recording artist Katy Perry, taken from her third studio album, ''[[Teenage Dream (Katy Perry album)|Teenage Dream]]'' (2010). Filled with suggestive lyrics pertaining to male genitalia, Perry's record label initially went against the idea of including it on her record. Similar to what happened with another song of hers {{endash}} "[[I Kissed a Girl]]" (2008) {{endash}} she refused. "Peacock" was met with generally negative reviews and, musically, was compared to the 1980's hit "[[Mickey (song)|Mickey]]" by [[Toni Basil]], and [[Gwen Stefani]]'s "[[Hollaback Girl]]" (2005).
 
The song performed well on music charts worldwide despite never released as a single. Its least successful charting territory was the United Kingdom, while it performed best in the US, topping ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]''{{'}}s [[Hot Dance Club Songs]] chart  for a week. Perry has performed "Peacock" on several occasions, including during her 2011 world tour [[California Dreams Tour]]. When performing the track, the singer usually wears colorful or glittery clothing.

== Background ==
[[Mikkel S. Eriksen]], [[Tor Erik Hermansen]] and [[Ester Dean]] assisted [[Katy Perry]] in writing "Peacock" for her third studio album, ''[[Teenage Dream (Katy Perry album)|Teenage Dream]]'', released in 2010. According to Perry, the whole point of writing "Peacock" was to play with words.<ref name="mtvinfo"/> Midway through recording the album, Perry recalled saying to the people she was working with: "Look I've got a lot of jewels, but I really don't have the crown. I really don't have that full-blown presentation". So she then decided to get back into the studio and work with [[Stargate (production team)|Stargate]], a production team [[music producer|co-producing]] ''Teenage Dream'', during a late-night session and made several more songs, including "[[Firework (song)|Firework]]" and "Peacock".<ref name="mtvinfo"/>

Originally, the singer's recording label, [[Capitol Records]], was against the inclusion of the song as a track on ''Teenage Dream'' as they deemed "Peacock" too controversial.<ref name="controversy"/> "They were all a bit worried about the word <U+2018>cock<U+2019> and it gave me [[d<U+00E9>j<U+00E0> vu]] because they did the exact same thing with '[[I Kissed a Girl]],'" Perry stated. Unhappy with the idea of making her music more family friendly, she refused. "They said, 'We don't see it as a single, we don't want it on the album.' And I was like, 'You guys are idiots'."<ref name="controversy">{{cite web |url=http://www.mtv.co.uk/news/katy-perry/234127-katy-perry-calls-record-label-idiots |title=Katy Perry Calls Record Label <U+2018>Idiots<U+2019> |publisher=Viacom |work=''MTV'' |location=United Kingdom |date=August 15, 2010 |accessdate=August 22, 2010}}</ref> When asked about "Peacock", Perry stated: "I<U+2019>m hoping it will be a [[Gay pride|gay-pride]] [[gay anthem|anthem]], [[Peafowl|peacock]]s represent a lot of individuality.... It<U+2019>s not just like, 'I wanna see your [[penis|bulge]].{{' "}} And then she went on to clarify: "It does have the word [[penis|cock]] in it, but art is also in fart! It<U+2019>s all in how you look at it."<ref>{{cite web |last=Stransky |first=Tanner |url=http://music-mix.ew.com/2010/08/02/katy-perry-peacock/ |title=Katy Perry debuts new song 'Peacock': 'I'm hoping it will be a gay-pride anthem' |work=[[Entertainment Weekly]] |publisher=[[Time Warner Inc]] |date=August 2, 2010 |accessdate=August 22, 2011}}</ref> Prior to the release of ''Teenage Dream'', the singer debuted "Peacock" in early August 2010 when she performed it at the MTV World Stage in [[Malaysia]].<ref name="debut">{{cite web |url=http://www.billboard.com/#/news/katy-perry-debuts-peacock-at-mtv-world-stage-1004107360.story |title=Katy Perry Debuts 'Peacock' At MTV World Stage in Malaysia |first=Gabriella |last=Landman |location=New York |work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |publisher=[[Nielsen Business Media, Inc]] |date=August 3, 2010 |accessdate=August 22, 2011}}</ref>

"Peacock" is a [[dance-pop]] song, with an [[up-tempo]] dance beat, that lasts for three minutes and fifty-two seconds.<ref name="sheet">{{cite web|url=http://www.musicnotes.com/sheetmusic/mtdVPE.asp?ppn=MN0088650#ProductDetails|title=Katy Perry Peacock <U+2013> Digital Sheet Music|work=''MusicNotes.com'' |publisher=[[Universal Music Publishing Group]]|accessdate=December 23, 2010}}</ref> The song is composed in the [[Key (music)|key]] of [[D minor]] and is set in [[time signature]] of [[common time]], with a [[tempo]] of 138 [[beats per minute]]. Perry's [[vocal range]] spans over an [[octave]], from B{{music|flat}}<sub>3</sub> to D<sub>5</sub>.<ref name="sheet"/> Lyrically, the track contains a [[double entendre]] with suggestive wording. ''[[New York Magazine]]'' writer Willa Paskin observed that Perry did the obvious with the song's hook ("she used a common word for penis and made it mean penis!").
Paskin also wrote that "Peacock" could perhaps be the most outrageous example of an entirely obvious double entendre.<ref name="nymag">{{cite web |url=http://nymag.com/daily/entertainment/2010/08/katy_perrys_peacock_and_the_dy.html |title=Katy Perry<U+2019>s <U+2018>Peacock<U+2019> and the Dying Art of the Double Entendre |first=Willa |publisher=Paskin |work=[[New York Magazine]] |publisher=[[The New York Times Company]] |date=August 3, 2010 |accessdate=August 22, 2011}}</ref> Perry herself has considered it to be the biggest innuendo in the world.

In her review of the album, ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' writer Lean Greenblatt dubbed it a shamelessly inane revival of Basil's 1980s hit.<ref name="ew">{{cite web |url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20409522,00.html |work=Entertainment Weekly |publisher=Time Warner Inc |title=Teenage Dream (2010) |first=Leah |last=Greenblatt |date=August 11, 2010 |accessdate=August 22, 2011}}</ref> Rob Sheffield, of the ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' publication, noticed the two songs shared a drum [[hook (music)|hook]], and thought of "Peacock" as a sequel to [[Gwen Stefani]]'s 2005 single, "[[Hollaback Girl]]".<ref>{{cite web |first=Rob |last=Sheffield |url=http://www.rollingstone.com/music/albumreviews/teenage-dream-20100823 |title=Teenage Dream by Katy Perry |title=Teenage Dream by Katy Perry |publisher=[[Jann Wenner|Wenner Media LLC]] |work=[[Rolling Stone (magazine)|Rolling Stone]] |date=August 23, 2010 |accessdate=August 22, 2010}}</ref>

==Critical reception==
[[File:Katyperry-cdt-peacock-edit.jpg|180px|right|thumb|Perry performing "Peacock" in Bournemouth, England during 2011.]]
The track was met with mostly negative reviews from critics, who mostly criticized the song's "cock, cock, cock" line. ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' staff writer Greg Knot said that "Peacock" adapting the beat from Basil's "Mickey" into a suggestive metaphor "barely qualifies as an off-color joke let alone a song."<ref name="chicago tribune">{{cite web |url=http://leisureblogs.chicagotribune.com/turn_it_up/2010/08/album-review-katy-perry-teenage-dream.html |title=Album review: Katy Perry, 'Teenage Dream' |first=Greg |last=Kot |publisher=[[Tribune Company]] |work=[[Chicago Tribune]] |date=August 22, 2010 |accessdate=August 22, 2011}}</ref> For his commentary in [[Allmusic]], [[Stephen Thomas]] found the singer to have distinguished herself through desperate [[vulgarity]]". Thomas concluded: "All this stylized provocation is exhausting, and not just because there<U+2019>s so much of it (none of it actually arousing). It<U+2019>s tiring because, at her heart, Perry is old-fashioned and is invested in none of her aggressive teasing."<ref>{{cite web |last=Thomas |first=Stephen |authorlink=Stephen Thomas |url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/teenage-dream-r1834720 |title=Teenage Dream: Katy Perry |publisher=[[Rovi Corporation]] |work=[[AllMusic]] |date=August 24, 2010 |accessdate=August 23, 2011}}</ref>

''[[USA Today]]''{{'}}s Elysa Gardner advised people who buy the album to skip the song.<ref>{{cite web |last=Gardner |first=Elysa |url=http://www.usatoday.com/life/music/reviews/2010-08-19-katyperry19_VA_N.htm |title=Review: Katy Perry is 'Dream'-ing of Madonna |publisher=[[Gannett Company]] |work=[[USA Today]] |date=August 18, 2010 |accessdate=August 23, 2011}}</ref> In his negative review for the album, Matthew Cole of [[Slant Magazine]] found it difficult to think of a song more unrefined or more irritating than "Peacock". He believed all reviews of ''Teenage Dream'' will discuss the track, which will be because it is "potentially historic in its badness, to the point that, once you've heard it, you too will have to describe it to other people just to convince yourself that it really exists."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.slantmagazine.com/music/review/katy-perry-teenage-dream/2219 |title=Katy Perry: Teenage Dream |work= |publisher=[[Slant Magazine]] |first=Matthew |last=Cole |date=August 22, 2010 |accessdate=August 23, 2011}}</ref> ''[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]'' magazine writer Mikael Wood remarked that the song contains a double entendre that even a performer such as [[Kesha|Ke$ha]] could find crude.<ref>{{cite web |last=Wood |first=Mikael |url=http://www.spin.com/reviews/katy-perry-teenage-dream-capitol |title=Katy Perry, 'Teenage Dream' (Capitol) |publisher=Spin Media LLC |work=[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]] |date=2010 |accessdate=August 23, 2011}}</ref> 

Writing in music website [[Sputnikmusic]], Rudy Klapper said she would bet that "Peacock" will "never seeing the light of day, primarily because it's a terrible song with a double entendre so blunt it would make Ke$ha blush". Klapper also said the lyrics do not compliment Perry's writing skills.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sputnikmusic.com/review/38708/Katy-Perry-Teenage-Dream/ |title=Katy Perry Teenage Dream |publisher=[[Sputnikmusic]] |first=Rudy |last=Klapper |accessdate=August 23, 2011}}</ref> ''[[Washington Post]]'' staff writer Chris Richards' review of the track was also negative. Talking about how hooks on ''Teenage Dream'' are catchy, but quickly start to erode if listeners pay more attention to the words, he cited "Peacock" as an example of this. Describing its chorus as "an earworm of the highest order," he said some of the lyrics are enough to make people clench their teeth.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/08/23/AR2010082304256.html |title=Album review of 'Teenage Dream' by Katy Perry |first=Chris |last=Richards |work=[[Washington Post]] |publisher=[[The Washington Post Company]] |date=August 24, 2010 |accessdate=August 23, 2011}}</ref> Bill Lamb from [[About.com]] was more positive, considering the track to be a pleasant singalong.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://top40.about.com/od/albums/fr/Katy-Perry-Teenage-Dream.htm |title=Katy Perry <U+2013> Teenage Dream |first=Bill |last=Lamb |publisher=[[The New York Times Company]] |work=''[[About.com]]'' |date=2010 |accessdate=August 23, 2011}}</ref>

Despite not being released as a [[single (song)|single]], "Peacock" managed to enter on a few charts around the world. The song peaked at number fifty-six on  the [[Canadian Hot 100]].<ref name="chot100"/> It did similarly in the Czech Republic, where it charted at number fifty-two.<ref name="ifpi"/> The [[UK Singles Chart]] was where "Peacock" had its lowest charting entry. In the week ending on September 11, 2010, the track found its peak at number one-hundred-twenty-five.<ref name="ukcharts"/> On ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]''{{'}}s US [[Hot Dance Club Songs]], the song had its highest peak position.

== Live performances and cover versions ==
[[File:KatyPerryBudapest02.png|thumb|right|240px|Perry performing "Peacock" in October 2010]]
For most performances of "Peacock", the singer usually dons a glittery aquamarine bustier<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tampabay.com/blogs/poplife/content/live-review-katy-perry-california-dreams-tour-st-pete-times-forum-tampa-june-10 |title=Live Review: Katy Perry "California Dreams Tour," St. Pete Times Forum, Tampa, June 10|work=[[St. Petersburg Times]] |publisher=[[Times Publishing Company]] |first=Sean |last=Daly |date=June 11, 2011 |accessdate=August 23, 2011}}</ref> or a colorful piece of clothing attached to her back that is to resemble peacock feathers. Perry's first performance of the song took place during August 2010 at the MTV World Stage.<ref name="debut"/> The stage she performed on included [[Theatrical property|props]] such as lifesize candy canes, background dancers dressed up like candy canes and a video of a blue eye surrounded by peacock feathers playing in the [[Theatrical scenery|backdrop]]. While dancing across the stage, Perry wore a white glitter unitard and tutu.<ref name="debut"/> 

In November, Perry also performed "Peacock" at New York's [[Roseland Ballroom]], where she introduced herself by popping out of a giant cake, dressed in a purple skin-tight cupcake print dress.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://idolator.com/5682012/katy-perry-roseland-ballroom-concertphotos/katy-perry-peacock |title=Katy Perry Turns NYC<U+2019>s Roseland Into Candyland (Photos) |first=Erika Brooks |last=Adickman |work=''[[Idolator (website)|Idolator]]'' |publisher=[[Buzz Media]]|date=November 9, 2010 |accessdate=August 22, 20110}}</ref> Additionally, Perry included "Peacock" in her [[setlist]] for her worldwide 2011 [[concert tour]], [[California Dreams Tour]] (February&ndash;November). When singing the song, the performance would include an elaborated feathered [[fan dance]] number. Concert reviewer Jim Abbott for the ''[[Orlando Sentinel]]'' felt that detailed performances such as the ones done for "Peacock" were a highlight for the singer's tour.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://blogs.orlandosentinel.com/entertainment_music_blog/2011/06/concert-review-katy-perry-at-ucf-arena.html |title=Concert review: Katy Perry at UCF Arena |first=Jim |last=Abbott |work=[[Orlando Sentinel]] |publisher=Tribune Company |date=June 9, 2011 |accessdate=August 23, 2011}}</ref>

Monthly [[LGBT]]-interest magazine ''[[The Advocate]]'' deemed "Peacock" to be "very gay".<ref name="parody"/> Having already parodied another of Perry's song's, "[[California Gurls]]", Ryan James Yezak did the same for "Peacock". The idea was conceived after he happened to see one of Perry's music-video producers in [[Laguna Beach]].<ref name="parody"/> After being told about the track, and that it was going to be popular and a gay anthem, James Yezak immediately agreed to do a parody. While less than James Yezak's parody of the former, his "Peacock" video received more than 130,000 reviews on the internet just two days after its release.<ref name="parody">{{cite web |url=http://www.advocate.com/Arts_and_Entertainment/Internet/Ruffling_Some_Peacock_Features_Katy_Perry/ |title=Ruffling Some (Peacock) Feathers |first=Scott |last=McPherson |work=[[The Advocate]] |publisher=[[Here Media]] |date=September 1, 2010 |accessdate=August 22, 2011}}</ref>
