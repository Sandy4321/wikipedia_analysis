'''Phillip Joseph Nevin''' (born [[January 19]], [[1971]] in [[Fullerton, California]]) is a former [[Major League Baseball]] player. He played for the [[Minnesota Twins]] ({{mlby|2006}}), [[Chicago Cubs]] (2006), [[Texas Rangers (baseball)|Texas Rangers]] ({{mlby|2005}}-2006) [[San Diego Padres]] ({{mlby|1999}}-2005), [[Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim|Anaheim Angels]] ({{mlby|1998}}), [[Detroit Tigers]] ({{mlby|1995}}-{{mlby|1997}}), and [[Houston Astros]] (1995). Nevin attended [[El Dorado High School (Placentia, California)|El Dorado High School]], in [[Placentia, California]] and [[California State University, Fullerton]] where he was awarded the [[Golden Spikes Award]] in 1992. He was also the "Most Outstanding Player" of the 1992 [[NCAA]] [[College World Series]]. He bats and throws [[right-handed]].

Nevin was selected as the first pick of the [[1992 Major League Baseball Draft]] by the Astros. [[Derek Jeter]] was selected sixth in the draft; [[Hal Newhouser]], a scout for Houston at the time, quit the franchise over the decision not to pick Jeter.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/columns/story?columnist=olney_buster&id=1863947|title=Jeter: Dynasty's child|accessdate=2008-08-12 |work=[[ESPN.com]]}}</ref>

During his twelve-season career, Nevin was a .270 [[batting average|hitter]] with 208 [[home run]]s and 743 [[Run batted in|RBI]] in 1217 games. He made the [[Major League Baseball All-Star Game|National League All-Star]] team in {{mlby|2001}}.  That year he led major league third basemen in [[Error (baseball)|errors]], however, with 27, <ref>[http://sports.espn.go.com/mlbhist/stats/fielding?groupId=9&sortColumn=errors&sortOrder=true&split=81&qualified=null&season=2001&seasonType=2]{{Dead link|date=May 2008}}</ref> and had the lowest [[fielding percentage]] of all major league third basemen (.930).

On July 25, 2005, Nevin rejected a trade that would have sent him to the [[Baltimore Orioles]] for [[pitcher]] [[Sidney Ponson]]. The proposed deal was contingent upon Nevin's approval. He had the right to block a trade to all but eight teams, including the Orioles.<ref>[http://www.miami.com/mld/miamiherald/sports/12222189.htm]{{Dead link|date=May 2008}}</ref> Four days later, he was traded to the Texas Rangers for [[Chan Ho Park]]. 

On May 31, 2006, he was traded to the Chicago Cubs; the Rangers were believed to be paying the majority of the amount still due to him on his contract. In return, the Rangers received [[second baseman]]/outfielder [[Jerry Hairston, Jr.]]. On August 31, the Minnesota Twins announced the trade of Nevin from the Cubs to the Twins for a [[player to be named later]] ([[Adam Harben]]) and "cash considerations."  To make room for Nevin, Twins' outfielder [[Shannon Stewart (baseball)|Shannon Stewart]] was placed on the 60-day [[disabled list]]. <ref>{{cite web |url=http://minnesota.twins.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20060831&content_id=1639433&vkey=news_min&fext=.jsp&c_id=min|title=Twins add veteran bat Nevin|accessdate=2008-08-12 |work=[[MLB.com]]}}</ref>

On May 12, {{mlby|2007}}, Nevin announced his retirement. He then began working pre-game radio shows with the Padres. In June {{by|2008}}, he returned to Goodwin Field at Cal State Fullerton as the ESPN analyst for the Super Regional against Stanford. In December 2008, he was named the [[Manager (baseball)|manager]] of the [[Orange County Flyers]] in the independent [[Golden Baseball League]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.orangecountyflyers.com/News/Phil-Nevin-Named-Manager-for-09.cfm |title=Phil Nevin Named Manager for 09' |accessdate=2008-12-23 |author= |authorlink= |date= |work=orangecountyflyers.com}}</ref>
