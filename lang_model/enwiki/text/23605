The '''history of Cornell University''' begins when its two founders [[Andrew Dickson White]] of [[Syracuse, New York|Syracuse]] and [[Ezra Cornell]] of [[Ithaca, New York|Ithaca]], met in the [[New York State Senate]] in January 1864. Together, they established [[Cornell University]] in [[Ithaca, New York|Ithaca]], [[New York]], in 1865. The university was initially funded by Ezra Cornell's $400,000 endowment and by New York's {{convert|989920|acre|km2|sing=on}} allotment of the [[Morrill Land-Grant Colleges Act|Morrill Land Grant Act of 1862]].<ref>{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=nykVAAAAYAAJ&printsec=titlepage#v=onepage&q=&f=false|title=My reminiscences of Ezra Cornell|first=Andrew|last=White|page=8|date=January 11, 1890|accessdate=2010-02-06}}</ref>

However, even before Ezra Cornell and Andrew White met in the New York Senate, each had separate plans and dreams that would draw them toward their collaboration in founding Cornell: White believed in the need for a great university for the nation that would take a radical new approach to education; and Cornell, who had great respect for education and philanthropy, desired to use his money "to do the greatest good."  [[Abraham Lincoln]]'s signing of [[Vermont]] [[Justin Smith Morrill|Senator Justin Morrill]]'s Land Grant Act into law was also critical to the formation of many [[university|universities]] in the post-[[American Civil War|Civil War]] era, including Cornell.

==Founders==
[[File:Ezra Cornell.jpg||thumb|200px|right|Ezra Cornell, namesake of [[Cornell University]]|alt=Ezra Cornell]]
As newly-elected members of the state senate, Cornell chaired the Committee of Agriculture and White was the chair of the Committee of Literature (which dealt with educational matters). Hence, both chaired committees with jurisdiction over bills allocating the land grant, which was to be used for instruction in "without excluding other scientific and classical studies and including [[military tactics|military tactic]], to teach such branches of learning as are related to [[agriculture]] and the [[mechanic arts]]".<ref>{{USC|7|304}}</ref> Yet, their eventual partnership seemed unlikely.  Although both valued egalitarianism, science, and education, they had come from two very different backgrounds.
Ezra Cornell, a self-made businessman and austere, pragmatic telegraph mogul, made his fortune on the [[Western Union|Western Union Telegraph Company]] stock he received during the consolidation that led to its formation.<ref>{{cite book|page=60|title=Cornell University: Founders and Founding|first=Carl|last=Becker|publisher=Cornell University Press|year=1943|isbn=978-0-8014-7615-0}}</ref>  Cornell, who had been poor for most of his life, suddenly found himself looking for ways that he could do the greatest good for with his money &mdash; he wrote, "My greatest care now is how to spend this large income to do the greatest good to those who are properly dependent on me, to the poor and to posterity."<ref>{{cite book|page=62|title=Cornell University: Founders and Founding|first=Carl|last=Becker|publisher=Cornell University Press|year=1943}}</ref>  Cornell's self-education and hard work would lead him to the conclusion that the greatest end for his philanthropy was in the need of colleges for the teaching of practical pursuits such as [[agriculture]], the [[applied science]]s, [[veterinary medicine]] and [[engineering]] and in finding opportunities for the poor to attain such an education.

[[File:Andrew Dickson White 1885.jpg||thumb|200px|left|Andrew Dickson White in 1885|alt=Andrew Dickson White]]
Andrew Dickson White entered college, at the age of 16, in 1849.  White dreamed of going to one of the elite eastern colleges, but his father sent him to [[Geneva College]] (later known as [[Hobart and William Smith Colleges|Hobart]]), a small [[Episcopal Church in the United States of America|Episcopal]] college.  At Geneva, White would read about the great colleges at [[Oxford University]] and at the [[University of Cambridge]]; this appears to be his first inspiration for "dreaming of a university worthy of the commonwealth [New York] and of the nation"; this dream would become a lifelong goal of White's.  After a year at Geneva, White convinced his father to send him to [[Yale University]].<ref name=adw2>{{cite book|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/1340|title=Autobiography of Andrew Dickson White <U+2014> Volume 1|first=Andrew Dickson|last=White|chapter=II|year=1911}}</ref>  For White, Yale was a great improvement over Geneva, but he found that even at one of the country's great universities there was "too much reciting by rote and too little real intercourse".

In the late 1850s, while White served as a professor of history at the [[University of Michigan]], he continued to develop his thoughts on a great American university.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://rmc.library.cornell.edu/presidents/view_item.php?sec=3&sub=8|title=Legacy of Leadership - Cornell's Presidents|accessdate=2010-01-24}}</ref> He was influenced by both the curriculum, which was more liberal than at the Eastern universities, and by the administration of the university as a secular institution.<ref name="adw18">{{cite book|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/1340|title=Autobiography of Andrew Dickson White <U+2014> Volume 1|first=Andrew Dickson|last=White|chapter=XVII|year=1911}}</ref>

==Conception==
White had been duly impressed by a bill introduced by Cornell in one of his first actions as a state senator: the incorporation of a large public library for Ithaca for which Cornell had donated $100,000.  White was struck by not only his generosity, but also "his breadth of mind".  He wrote:

<blockquote>
The most striking sign of this was his mode of forming a board of trustees; for, instead of the usual effort to tie up the organization forever in some sect, party or clique, he had named the best men of his town &mdash; his political opponents as well as his friends; and had added to them the pastors of all the principal churches, Catholic and Protestant.<ref name="adw18"/>
</blockquote>

Yet, Cornell and White soon found themselves on opposite sides of a battle that would in the end lead to the creation of Cornell University. In 1863, the legislature had granted the proceeds of the land grant to the People's College in Havana [[Montour Falls]], with conditions that would need to be met within a certain time frame. Because the [[Morrill Act]] set a five-year limit on each state identifying a land grant college, and it seemed unlikely that the People's College would meet its conditions, the legislature was ready to select a different school.  Initially, Cornell, as a member of the Board of Trustees of the New York State Agricultural College at [[Ovid, New York|Ovid]], wanted half the grant to go to that school.  However, White "vigorously opposed this bill, on the ground that the educational resources of the state were already too much dispersed".<ref>Becker, op. cite p. 82.</ref> He felt that the grant would be most effective if it were used to establish or strengthen a comprehensive university.

Still working to send part of the grant to the Agricultural College, on September 25, 1864, in [[Rochester, New York]], Cornell announced his offer to donate $300,000 (soon thereafter increased to $500,000) if part of the land grant could be secured and the trustees moved the college to Ithaca.<ref name="adw18"/>  White did not relent; however, he said he would support a similar measure that did not split up the grant.<ref name="adw18"/>  Thus began the collaboration between Ezra Cornell and Andrew D. White that became Cornell University.

==Establishment==
[[File:Cornell Senate Bill.jpg|thumb|150px|right|1865 [[New York State Senate|Senate]] bill to establish [[Cornell University]]]]
On February 7, 1865, Andrew D. White introduced an act to the State Senate "to establish the Cornell University", which appropriated the full income of the sale of lands given to New York under the Morrill Act to the university.  But, while Cornell and White had come to an agreement, they faced fierce opposition, including from the People's College in Havana [[Montour Falls]],<ref>{{cite journal|jstor=368090|title=The People's College, The Mechanics' Mutual Protection and the Agricultural College Act|first=Daniel W.|last=Lang|work=History of Education Quarterly|volume=18|issue=3|date=Autumn 1978|pages=295<U+2013>321}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|url=http://nytompki.org/Landmarks/cornell_ch3.htm|title=Landmarks of Tompkins County, New York|first=John H.|last= Selkreg|year=1894|publisher=D.

To placate legislators representing Ovid, White arranged for the Willard State Asylum for the Insane to be located on the land held for the Agricultural College.<ref name=adw19>{{cite book|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/1340|title=Autobiography of Andrew Dickson White <U+2014> Volume 1|first=Andrew Dickson|last=White|chapter=XIX|year=1911}}</ref> The bill limited the total amount of property or endowment that Cornell University could hold to $3 million.<ref>{{cite book|page=92|title=Cornell University: Founders and Founding|first=Carl|last=Becker|publisher=Cornell University Press|year=1943|isbn=978-0-8014-7615-0}}. See also Section 5 of the Cornell charter.</ref>

The bill was modified at least twice in attempts to attain the votes necessary for passage.  In the first change, the People's College was given three months to meet certain conditions for which it would receive the land grant under the 1863 law.  The second came from a Methodist faction, which wanted a share of the grant for [[Genesee College]].  They agreed to a quid-pro quo donation of $25,000 from Ezra Cornell in exchange for their support.  Cornell insisted the bargain be written into the bill.<ref name="adw18"/>  The bill was signed into law by [[Reuben Fenton|Governor Reuben E. Fenton]] on April 27, 1865.  On July 27, the People's College lost its claim to the land grant funds, and the building of Cornell University began.

From 1865 to 1868, the year the university opened, Ezra Cornell and Andrew D. White worked in tireless collaboration to build their university.  Ezra Cornell oversaw the construction of the university's first buildings, starting with Morrill Hall, and spent time investing the federal land scrip in western lands for the university that would eventually net millions of dollars,<ref name="adw18"/> while Andrew D. White, who was unanimously elected the first President of Cornell University by the Board of Trustees on November 21, 1866, began making plans for the administrative and educational policies of the university.  To this end, he traveled to France, Germany and England "to visit model institutions, to buy books and equipment, to collect professors".  White returned from Europe to be inaugurated as Cornell's president in 1868, and he remained leader of Cornell until his retirement from the presidency in 1885.

==Opening==
[[File:1882 Cornell University faculty.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The Cornell faculty in 1882|alt=Cornell faculty in 1882]]
The university's Inauguration Day took place on October 7, 1868.<ref name=adw20>{{cite book|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/1340|title=Autobiography of Andrew Dickson White <U+2014> Volume 1|first=Andrew Dickson|last=White|chapter=XX|year=1911}}</ref>  The previous day, each of the candidates who showed up in Ithaca was given an entrance examination.  There were 412 successful applicants; with this initial enrollment, Cornell's first class was, at the time, the largest entering class at an American university.<ref name=becker131>{{cite book|page=131|title=Cornell University:Founders and Founding|first=Carl|last=Becker|publisher=Cornell University Press|year=1943}}</ref>

On the occasion, Ezra Cornell delivered a brief speech.  He said, "I hope we have laid the foundation of an institution which shall combine practical with liberal education. ... I believe we have made the beginning of an institution which will prove highly beneficial to the poor young men and the poor young women of our country." His speech included another statement which later became the school's motto, "I would found an institution where any person can find instruction in any study.''<ref name=adw20/>

Two other Ezra Cornell-founded, Ithaca institutions played a role in the rapid opening of the university.  The Cornell Library, a public library in downtown Ithaca which opened in 1866,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://rmc.library.cornell.edu/presidents/view_item.php?sec=2&sub=5|title=The Cornell Public Library|publisher=Cornell University|accessdate=2010-03-07}}</ref> served as a classroom and library for the first students.  Also Cascadilla Hall, which was constructed in 1866 as a [[water cure (therapy)|water cure]] sanitarium,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fs.cornell.edu/fs/facinfo/fs_facilInfo.cfm?facil_cd=3001|title=3001-Cascadilla Hall Facility Information|publisher=Cornell University|accessdate=2010-02-26}}</ref> served at the university's first dormitory.<ref name=becker131/>

[[File:Cornellpenngame23.jpg|thumb|left|250px|A Cornell-[[University of Pennsylvania|Penn]] baseball game in 1919|alt=baseball game in 1919]]
Cornell was among the [[List of mixed-sex colleges and universities in the United States|first universities]] in the United States to admit women alongside men.  The first woman was admitted to Cornell in 1870, although the university did not yet have a women's dormitory.  On February 13, 1872, Cornell's Board of Trustees accepted an offer of $250,000 from [[Henry W. Sage]] to build such a dormitory. During the construction of [[Sage Residential College|Sage College]] (now home to the [[Samuel Curtis Johnson Graduate School of Management]] as Sage Hall) and after its opening in 1875, the admittance of women to Cornell continued to increase.

Significant departures from the standard curriculum were made at Cornell under the leadership of Andrew D. White.  In 1868, Cornell introduced the ''elective system'', under which students were free to choose their own course of study.  [[Harvard University]] would make a similar change in 1872, soon after the inauguration of [[Charles William Eliot|Charles W. Eliot]] in 1869.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.president.harvard.edu/history/21_eliot.php|title=Charles William Eliot - History|publisher=Harvard University|accessdate=2010-03-15}}</ref>

It was the success of the egalitarian ideals of the newly-established Cornell, a uniquely American institution, that would help drive some of the changes seen at other universities throughout the next few decades, and would lead educational historian Frederick Rudolph to write:

<blockquote>
Andrew D. White, its first president, and Ezra Cornell, who gave it his name, turned out to be the developers of the first American university and therefore the agents of revolutionary curricular reform.<ref>Quoted in {{cite book|title=The creation of the future: the role of the American university|author= Frank Harold Trevor Rhodes|page=5|publisher=Cornell University Press |year=2001 |isbn=978-0-8014-3937-7}}</ref>
</blockquote>
[[File:Uris Library dedication plaque, Cornell Univ, Ithaca NY.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Dedication [[Commemorative plaque|plaque]]on Uris Library referencing Sage's gift in lieu of Jennie McGraw's estate payment|alt=Uris Library plaque]]
In 1892, the University [[Library]] was opened. Known today as Uris Library, it was the result of a gift from [[Henry W. Sage]] in memory of [[Jennie McGraw]]. In her [[Will (law)|will]], she left $300,000 to her husband [[Willard Fiske]], $550,000 to her brother Joseph and his children, $200,000 to Cornell for a library, $50,000 for construction of McGraw Hall, $40,000 for a student hospital, and the remainder to the University for whatever use it saw fit. However, the University's charter limited its property holdings to $3,000,000,<ref>{{cite book|title=Cornell University: Founders and Founding|first=Carl|last=Becker|page=88|publisher=Cornell University Press|year=1943}}</ref> and Cornell could not accept the full amount of McGraw's gift. When Fiske realized that the university had failed to inform him of this restriction, he launched a legal assault to re-acquire the money, known as The Great Will Case.  The [[United States Supreme Court]] eventually affirmed the judgment of the [[New York Court of Appeals]] that Cornell could not receive the estate on May 19, 1890, with Justice [[Samuel Blatchford]] giving the majority opinion.<ref>[http://dpb.cornell.edu/documents/1000037.pdf], accessed 7/25/06</ref><ref name=mcgraw>[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=950CEFDC123BE533A25753C2A9639C94619ED7CF Cornell Loses a Legacy: Decision Against the University in the Fisk Suit.

==Coeducation==
In 1870, Cornell admitted its first female students,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gradschool.cornell.edu/index.php?p=36|title=Our History|accessdate=2010-02-21|publisher=Cornell University}}</ref> making it the first coeducational school among what came to be known as the Ivy League. However, the admission of female students was limited until the construction of Sage Hall to serve as a women's dormitory in 1872.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fs.cornell.edu/fs/facinfo/fs_facilinfo.cfm?facil_cd=3002 |title=3002-SAGE HALL - Facility Information |publisher=Fs.cornell.edu |date= |accessdate=2011-11-28}}</ref> [[File:Rummell, Richard Cornell University.jpg|thumb|250px|"Cornell University" by renowned landscape artist Richard Rummell (1848-1924), circa 1910.

For example, the NYS College of Home Economics and the [[Cornell School of Nursing]] historically drew a disproportionate number of women students, while the [[Cornell University College of Engineering|College of Engineering]] attracted fewer women.

Early in the history of the university, female students were separated from male students in many ways.<ref>Fogle, Homer William Jr., "<U+2206>X of <U+2206>KE Research Note #06: Anti-coedism Philosophy and Mores" July 10, 2010. Cornell University Archives.</ref>  For example, they had a separate entrance and lounges in Willard Straight Hall, a separate student government, and a separate page (edited by women) in the ''[[Cornell Daily Sun]].''  The male students were required to take "drill" (a precursor to [[ROTC]]), but the women were exempt. One account of the history of coeducation at Cornell claims that in the very beginning, "[m]ale students were almost unanimously opposed to co-education, and vigorously protested the arrival of a group of 16 women, who promptly formed a women's club with a broom for their standard, and '[[In hoc signo vinces]]' as their motto."<ref name="Loebenstein 1955"/> In the 1870s and 1880s, female Cornell students on campus were generally ignored by male students.<ref name="Loebenstein 1955"/><ref>{{cite news|title=Not Looked Upon with Favor by the Young Men of the University Have Few Interests in Common Male Students Do Not Regard the "Co-eds" as Their Equals Socially|work=New York Herald|date=June 22, 1894}}</ref>  Women did not have a formal role in the annual commencement ceremony until 1935, when the student government selected a woman to be Class Poet.<ref>{{cite news|work=Cornell Daily Sun|volume=55|number=128|date=21 March 1935|title=A Woman Poet}}</ref> In 1936, the Willard Straight Hall Board of Managers voted to allow women to eat in its cafeteria.<ref>{{cite news|title=The Last Stand|work=Cornell Daily Sun|volume=56|number=82|date=14 January 1936}}</ref> Until the 1970s, male students resided in west campus dormitories while women were housed in the north campus.

The [[Cornell University College of Veterinary Medicine|NYS College of Veterinary Medicine]] was an early pioneer in educating women.  Florence Kimball, the first woman in the United States to receive the DVM degree, graduated from Cornell in 1910. Seven of the first 11 women to become licensed veterinarians in this country were Cornell graduates.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vet.cornell.edu/about/history.cfm |title=Retrieved 2011-01-03 |publisher=Vet.cornell.edu |date=2011-08-26 |accessdate=2011-11-28}}</ref>  However, until the early 1980s, the Vet College limited the number of women in each entering class to four or less, regardless of female applicants' qualifications.<!--<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vet.ksu.edu/AWV/pdf/History/06.pdf|title=Veterinary Fraternities and Sororities|accessdate=2010-01-24}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vet.k-state.edu/awv/pdf/History/43.pdf|title=One Woman Veterinarian's Perspective on the Profession|first=Katherine|last=Houpt|accessdate=2010-01-24|publisher=Kansas State University}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref>--><ref>{{cite web|url=http://veterinarylegacy.blogspot.com/2010/12/women-veterinarians-at-cornell.html|title=Admission of Women to Veterinary Medicine at Cornell|first=Donald F.|last=Smith|date=December 1, 2010|accessdate=2011-01-01|publisher=Veterinary Legacy}}</ref>

With the implementation of [[Title IX]] in the mid-1970s, Cornell significantly expanded its athletic offerings for women. The Department of Physical Education and Athletics moved from having all women's activities housed in Helen Newman Hall to having men's and women's programs in all facilities.

==Nonsectarianism and religion on campus==
Up until the time of Cornell's founding, most prominent American colleges had ties to religious denominations.<ref>Becker op. cite. at 7-14.</ref> Cornell was founded as a non-sectarian school, but had to compete with church-sponsored institutions for gaining New York's land grant status.  A.D. White noted in his inaugural address,  "We will labor to make this a Christian institution, a sectarian institution may it never be."<ref name=chapel>{{cite web|url=http://www.cornell.edu/search/index.cfm?tab=facts&q=&id=630|title=Sage Chapel|publisher=Cornell University|accessdate=2010-10-06}}</ref> However, the university has made provision for voluntary religious observance on campus. Currently, the University Charter provides, "Persons of every religious denomination, or of no religious denomination, shall be equally eligible to all offices and appointments".<ref>New York State Education Law <U+00A7>5702.</ref> Through the 20th century, the University Charter also required that a majority of trustees could not be of any single denomination. [[Sage Chapel]], a non-denominational house of worship opened in 1875.<ref name=chapel/>  Since 1929, the Cornell United Religious Works (CURW) has been an umbrella organization for the campus chaplains sponsored by different denominations and faiths.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.curw.cornell.edu/chaplains.html|title=Chaplains|publisher=Cornell University|accessdate=2010-10-06}}</ref>  Perhaps the most newsworthy of the chaplains was [[Daniel Berrigan]] who, while Assistant Director of CURW, became a national leader in protesting the [[Vietnam War]].<ref>{{cite book |title=Who Spoke Up?

In the late 1950s, the National Council of Young Israel (NCYI) leased a house across the street from the university and established a Jewish living center and kosher dining hall.  The Cornell Young Israel chapter became the Center for Jewish Living, and a new Foundation for Kosher Observance at Cornell, Inc. was established so that the university's dining department would operate both a kosher kitchen at the center as well as serving kosher food on the North Campus.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cornellcjl.com/about/history.php|title=History - Center for Jewish Living at Cornell|accessdate=2010-10-06}}</ref>

Since the 1870s, Cornell's system of fraternities and sororities grew to play a large role in student life, with many chapters becoming a part of national organizations.  As of 1952, 19 fraternities had national restrictions based on race, religion or national origin, and of the 32 fraternities without such national requirements, 19 did not have "mixed" memberships.

In 1873, the cornerstone of [[Sage Residential College|Sage Hall]] was laid. This new hall was to house the Sage College for Women and thus to concretely establish Cornell University's coeducational status.<ref name="Goetz 1997">{{cite web|url=http://www.news.cornell.edu/chronicle/97/3.20.97/Ezra_letter.html|title=Ezra Cornell's commitment to nonsectarianism|last=Goetz|first=Jill|date=20 March 1997|publisher=[[Cornell Chronicle]]|accessdate=2010-07-23}}</ref> Ezra Cornell wrote a letter for posterity&mdash;dated 15 May 1873&mdash;and sealed it into the cornerstone. No copies of the letter were made, and Cornell kept its contents a secret. However, he hinted at the theme of the letter during his speech at the dedication of Sage Hall, stating that "the letter deposited in the cornerstone addressed to the future man and woman, of which I have kept no copy, will relate to future generations the cause of the failure of this experiment, if it ever does fail, as I trust in God it never will."<ref name="Goetz 1997"/>

Cornell historians largely assumed that the "experiment" to which Cornell referred was that of coeducation, given that Sage Hall was to be a women's dormitory and that coeducation was still a controversial issue at the time.<ref name="Goetz 1997"/>  However, when the letter was finally unearthed in 1997, its focus was revealed to be the university's nonsectarian status&mdash;a principle which had invited equal controversy in the 19th century, given that most universities of the time had specific religious affiliations. Cornell wrote:{{cquote|<blockquote><p>On the occasion of laying the corner stone of the Sage College for women of Cornell University, I desire to say that the principle{{sic}} danger, and I say almost the only danger I see in the future to be encountered by the friends of education, and by all lovers of true liberty is that which may arise from sectarian strife.</p>

<p>Coeducation of the sexes and entire freedom from sectarian or political preferences is the only proper and safe way for providing an education that shall meet the wants of the future and carry out the founders idea of an Institution where "any person can find instruction in any study."

==Infrastructure innovations==
Cornell was one of the first university campuses to use electricity to light the grounds from a water-powered dynamo in 1883.<ref name=chp>{{cite web|url=http://www.utilities.cornell.edu/utl_heatinghistory.html|title=The Early History of District Energy at Cornell University|accessdate=2009-11-24|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070704140529/http://www.utilities.cornell.edu/utl_heatinghistory.html|archivedate=2007-07-04}}</ref> In 1888-89, Cornell installed a central steam distribution system encased in logs. This eventually grew to three district plants on the Engineering Quadrangle, behind the Arts College, and on the state campus (located in Beebe Hall).<ref name=chp/> In 1904, the present hydroelectric plant was built in the Fall Creek gorge following the replacement in 1896 of Triphammer Dam slightly west of its original location. The plant takes water from Beebe Lake through a tunnel in the side of the gorge to power up to 1.9 megawatts of electricity. The plant continued to serve the campus's electric needs until 1970, when local utility rates placed a heavy economic penalty on independently generating electricity. The abandoned plant was vandalized in 1972, but renovated and placed back into service in 1981.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.utilities.cornell.edu/utl_hydroelectricplant.html|title=Hydroelectric Plant|accessdate=2009-11-24|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070609101022/http://www.utilities.cornell.edu/utl_hydroelectricplant.html|archivedate=2007-06-09}}</ref>

In 1986-87, a cogeneration facility was added to the central heating plant to generate electricity from the plant's waste heat.<ref name=chp/> A Cornell Combined Heat & Power Project, which was completed in December 2009, shifted the central heating plant from using coal to natural gas and enable the plant to generate all of the campus's non-peak electric requirements.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.news.cornell.edu/stories/Jan10/CHPopening.html|date=January 18, 2010|title=CU moves beyond coal with opening of new power plan|first= Bill |last=Steele|accessdate=2010-01-24|work=Cornell Chronicle}}</ref>

In the 1880s, a suspension bridge was built across Fall Creek to provide pedestrian access to the campus from the North.  In 1913, Professors S.C. Hollister and William McGuire designed a new suspension bridge that is {{convert|138|ft|m|abbr=on}}, 3.5 in. above the water and {{convert|500|ft|m|abbr=on}} downstream from the original.  However, the second bridge was declared unsafe and closed August 1960 to be rebuilt with a replacement of the same design.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.alumni.cornell.edu/cu_facts/read_more.cfm?id=33|title=Suspension Bridge|accessdate=2009-11-24|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070610013028/http://www.alumni.cornell.edu/cu_facts/read_more.cfm?id=33|archivedate=2007-06-10}}</ref>

Cornell began operating a closed loop, central chilled water system for air conditioning and laboratory cooling in the 1963 using centralized mechanical chillers, rather than inefficient, building-specific air conditioners.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.utilities.cornell.edu/utl_cooling.html|title=Cooling - Chilled Water Plants|accessdate=2010-03-07|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20050507050208/www.utilities.cornell.edu/LSC/Prospectus/history.htm|archivedate=2005-05-07}}</ref> In 2000, Cornell began operation of its [[Deep lake water cooling|Lake Source Cooling System]] which uses the cold water temperature at the bottom of [[Cayuga Lake]] (approx 39 <U+00B0>F) to air condition the campus.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.utilities.cornell.edu/utl_lscabout.html|title=Lake Source Cooling: An Idea Whose Time Has Come|accessdate=2009-11-24|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20050426143921/www.utilities.cornell.edu/LSC/Prospectus/default.htm|archivedate=2005-04-26}}</ref>  The system was the first wide-scale use of lake source cooling in North America.

==Giving and alumni involvement==
The first endowed chair at Cornell was the Professorship of Hebrew and Oriental Literature and History donated by New York City financier [[Joseph Seligman]] in 1874,<ref>{{cite news|url=http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?_r=1&res=9E00E1DB1139EF34BC4953DFB166838F669FDE|work=New York Times|date=July 1, 1874|title=Commencement Season.; Cornell University. The Sixth Annual Commencement Address of Prof. Felix Adler|page=5|accessdate=2010-02-01 | format=PDF | first=Our | last=Own}}</ref> with the proviso that he (Seligman) would nominate the chairholder; and following his wishes, Dr. [[Felix Adler (Society for Ethical Culture)]], was appointed. After two years, Professor Adler was quietly let go. Seligman demanded an inquiry. On rebuffing Joseph Seligman in 1877, the Trustees established one of their guiding principles governing the receipt of gifts, "That in the future no Endowment of Professorships will be accepted by the (Cornell) University which deprives the Board of Trustees of the power to Select The persons who shall fill such professorships".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dpb.cornell.edu/documents/1000037.pdf |title=page 12. |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2011-11-28}}</ref> The second was the Susan E. Linn Sage Professor of Ethics and Philosophy given in 1890 by [[Henry W. Sage]]. Since then, 327 named professorships have been established, of which 43 are honorary and do not have endowments. The university's first endowed scholarship was established in 1892.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dpb.cornell.edu/documents/1000037.pdf|page=13|title=Gifts and Giving|first=Michael|last=Whalen|date=May 2003|publisher=Cornell University|accessdate=December 15, 2010}}</ref>

The original University charter adopted by the New York State legislature required that Cornell give scholarships from students in each legislative district to attend the University tuition-free.<ref>{{cite book|page=93|title=Cornell University: Founders and Founding|first=Carl|last=Becker|publisher=Cornell University Press|year=1943|isbn=978-0-8014-7615-0}}</ref>  Although both Cornell and White believed this meant one scholarship, the legislature later argued that it meant one new freshman student per district each year, or four per district.<ref>{{cite book|first=Carl L. |last=Becker|year=1943|title=Cornell University: Founders and the Founding|publisher=Cornell University Press|pages=93<U+2013>94|url=http://dspace.library.cornell.edu/handle/1813/184|accessdate=2009-10-19}}</ref> This allowed students of diverse financial resources to attend the university from the start.

John McMullen, who was president of the Atlantic Gulf & Pacific Dredging Company, while not a Cornellian himself, bequeathed his estate to Cornell for engineering scholarships on the advice of a friend and Cornell alumnus. Instead of spending the bequest and its earnings on scholarships, Cornell's Trustees decided to invest those funds, and eventually sold the dredging company.  The resulting fund is Cornell's largest single scholarship endowment. Since 1925, the fund has provided substantial assistance to more than 3,700 engineering students.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.giving.cornell.edu/guide/engineering.cfm?cat=24|title=John McMullen Schoarships|accessdate=2009-10-19}}</ref> (Cornell has received a number of unusual non-cash (in-kind) gifts over the years, including: Ezra Cornell's farm, the Cornell Aeronautical Laborary (see below), a copy of Lincoln's Gettysburg Address, a Peruvian mummy, and the Ostrander elm trees.)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dpb.cornell.edu/documents/1000037.pdf|page=14|title=Gifts and Giving|first=Michael|last=Whalen|date=May 2003|publisher=Cornell University|accessdate=December 15, 2010}}</ref>

Before the university opened, the State Legislature amended Cornell's charter on April 24, 1867 to specify alumni elected trustees.<ref>{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=bPIKAAAAIAAJ&dq=first%20alumni%20trustees%20cornell%20elect&pg=PA278#v=onepage&q&f=false|page=278|title=Cornell University, a history, Volume 1|authors=Waterman Thomas Hewett, Frank R.

In October 1890, [[Andrew Carnegie]] became a Cornell Trustee and quickly became aware of the lack of an adequate pension plans for Cornell faculty.  His concern led to the formation in 1905 of what is now called [[TIAA-CREF|Teachers Insurance and Annuity Association of America]] (TIAA).<ref>Cornell Financial Plan May 2007 p. 32</ref> In October 2010, David A.

Many alumni classes elected secretaries to maintain correspondence with classmates.  In 1905, the Class Secretaries organized to form what is now called the Cornell Association of Class Officers, which meets annually to develop alumni class programs and assist in organizing reunions. The ''Cornell Alumni News'' is an independent, alumni-owned publication founded in 1899<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cdsun.library.cornell.edu/cgi-bin/newscornell?a=d&srpos=1&cl=search&d=CDS19710907.2.1.3&e=--------20--1----Cornell+Alumni+News+independence-all|title=Trustees Seek Clear 'Alumni News' Policy|first=Joseph|last=Massi|date=September 7, 1971|page=1|work=Cornell Daily Sun|accessdate=2009-11-28}}</ref>  It is owned and controlled by the Cornell Alumni Association, a separate nonprofit corporation and is now known as ''Cornell Alumni Magazine''.

==Support from New York State==
[[File:cornellstonehall.gif|thumb|right|250px|Stone Hall, Roberts Hall and East Roberts were demolished in the 1980s|alt=Stone Hall, Roberts Hall and East Roberts]]
Under the Morrill Act, states were obligated to fund the maintenance of land grant college facilities, but were not obligated to fund operations.  Subsequent laws required states to match federal funds for agricultural research stations and cooperative extension.  In his inaugural address as Cornell's third president on November 11, 1892, [[Jacob Gould Schurman]] announced his intention to enlist the financial support of the state.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://rmc.library.cornell.edu/presidents/view_item.php?sec=4&sub=22|title=Inaugurating the Presidents|accessdate=2010-02-01}}</ref>  Until that point, Cornell's relationship with the state was a net economic loss. Cornell was offering full scholarships to four students in each New York assembly district every year and was spending funds to serve as the state's [[land-grant university]]. It determined to convince the state to become a benefactor of the university, instead.  In 1894, the state legislature voted to give financial support for the establishment of the [[Cornell University College of Veterinary Medicine|New York State College of Veterinary Medicine]] and to make annual appropriations for the college.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vet.cornell.edu/about/history.cfm|title=History and Archieves of the Cornell University College of Veterinary Medicine|accessdate=2011-01-01}}</ref>  This set the precedents of privately-controlled, state-supported [[statutory college]]s and cooperation between Cornell and the state. The annual state appropriations were later extended to agriculture, home economics, and following [[World War II]], industrial and labor relations.

In 1882, Cornell opened the New York State [[Agricultural Experiment Station]] in [[Geneva, New York]], the sixth oldest institution of its kind in the United States.<ref>[http://www.nysaes.cornell.edu/about/history.html Experiment Station History] Retrieved 2010-03-07.</ref>  It made significant advances in scientific agriculture and for many years played an active role in agriculture law enforcement.

In 1900, a home economics curriculum was added to Cornell's Agriculture college.  This was expanded to a separate state-supported school in 1919.<ref>[http://www.human.cornell.edu/about-our-college/facts/history.cfm] Retrieved 2010-11-05.</ref>  The Home Economics School, in turn, began to develop classes in hotel administration in 1922, which spun off into a separate, endowed college in 1950.<ref>[http://www.hotelschool.cornell.edu/about/history.html History] Retrieved 2010-03-27.</ref>

In 1898, the [[New York State College of Forestry at Cornell|New York State College of Forestry]] opened at Cornell, which was the first forestry college in North America.<ref name=dnr>{{cite web|url=http://www.dnr.cornell.edu/mission/history/ |title=Department History|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20071007112429/http://www.dnr.cornell.edu/mission/history/|archivedate=2007-10-07|accessdate=2010-03-07}}</ref>  The College undertook to establish a {{convert|30000|acre|km2|adj=on}} demonstration forest in the Adirondacks, funded by New York State.<ref>{{cite book |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=0L8LAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA203&lpg=PA203&dq=Brooklyn+Cooperage+Company%5D#v=onepage&q=Brooklyn%20Cooperage%20Company%5D&f=false|title=A history of the Adirondacks, Volume 2|first=Alfred Lee|last=Donaldson|pages=202<U+2013>207|publisher=Century Co|year=1921|accessdate=2010-03-07}}</ref>  However, the plans of the school's director [[Bernhard Fernow]] for the land drew criticism from neighbors living on Saranac Lake, [[Knollwood Club]], and Governor [[Benjamin B.

Cornell eventually established a research forest south of Ithaca, the Arnot Woods. When New York State later funded the construction of a Forestry building for the Agriculture school, [[New York State College of Agriculture and Life Sciences]], Cornell named it [[Fernow Hall (Ithaca, New York)|Fernow Hall]].

In 1914, the US Department of Agriculture began to fund [[cooperative extension service]]s through the land grant college of each state, and Cornell expanded its impact by sending agents to spread knowledge in each county of New York State. Although Syracuse had started awarding forestry degrees at this point, Cornell's extension agents covered all of home economics and agriculture, including forestry.

In 1945, the New York State Legislature founded the [[Cornell University School of Industrial and Labor Relations|New York State School of Industrial and Labor Relations at Cornell]], in response to requests from organized labor and Democratic leaders.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ilr.cornell.edu/about/ILRhistory.html|title=A Brief History of ILR|accessdate=2010-01-24}}</ref>  The school quickly gained national stature when [[U.S. Secretary of Labor]] [[Frances Perkins]], who was the first female US Cabinet member and served longer than anyone else as Secretary of Labor (12 years), joined the ILR faculty. Since agricultural interests were mostly affiliated with the Republicans, Cornell enjoyed bi-partisan support following World War II.

In 1948, the Legislature placed all state-funded higher education into the new State University of New York (SUNY). Cornell's four [[statutory college]]s (agriculture, human ecology, labor relations and veterinary medicine) have been affiliated with SUNY since its inception, but did not have any such state affiliation prior to that time. Statutory college employees legally are employees of Cornell, not employees of SUNY. The State Education Law gives the SUNY Board of Trustees the authority to approve Cornell's appointment of the deans/unit heads of the statutory colleges, and control of the level of state funding for the statutory colleges.<ref>N.Y.S. Education Law <U+00A7> 355(g).</ref>

Today, state support is significant.  In 2007-08, Cornell received a total of $174 million of state appropriations for operations.<ref>Cornell Financial Plan May 2007 p. 75</ref>  Of the $2.5 billion in capital spending budgeted for 2007<U+2013>2017, $721 million was to come from the state of New York.<ref>Cornell Financial Plan May 2007 p. 65</ref>

==Medical education==
{{main|Weill Cornell Medical College}}
Starting in 1878, Cornell's Ithaca campus offered a pre-medical school curriculum, although most medical students enrolled in medical school directly after high school.<ref name=bishop317>{{Cite book|title=A History of Cornell|first=Morris|last=Bishop|publisher=Cornell University Press|year=1962|isbn=978-0-8014-0036-0|page=317|location=Ithaca, NY}}</ref>  In 1896, three New York City institutions, the University Medical College, the Loomis Laboratory and the Bellevue Hospital Medical College united with the goal of affiliating with [[New York University]] (NYU).  Unfortunately, NYU imposed a number of surprising new policies including limiting faculty to what they would have otherwise earned in private practice.<ref>Bishop, op cite. p. 318</ref> The faculty revolted in 1897 and sought return of the property of the three former institutions, with a resulting lawsuit.  On March 22, 1904 and April 5, 1904, the New York State Court of Appeals ordered NYU to return property to Loomis Laboratory because the NYU Dean had breached oral promises made to form the merger.<ref>Bishop, op cite. p. 319</ref>  Having won their separation from NYU, the medical faculties sought a new university affiliation, and on April 14, 1898, Cornell's Board of Trustees voted to create a medical school and elected former NYU professors as its Dean and faculty.<ref name="Bishop, op cite. p. 320">Bishop, op cite. p. 320</ref> The school opened on October 4, 1898 in the Loomis Laboratory facilities.

In 1927, [[William Payne Whitney]]'s $27 million donation led to the building of the [[Payne Whitney Psychiatric Clinic]], which became the name for Weill Cornell's large psychiatric effort. That same year, the college became affiliated with New York Hospital and the two institutions moved to their current joint campus in 1932. The hospital's Training School for Nurses became affiliated with the university in 1942, operating as the Cornell Nursing School until it closed in 1979.<ref name=medhist>{{cite web | url = http://www.med.cornell.edu/about/our_cen_ach.html| title = Weill Medical College: Our years of achievement| accessdate = 2006-07-06}}</ref>

In 1998, Cornell University Medical College's affiliate hospital, New York Hospital, merged with Presbyterian Hospital (the affiliate hospital for [[Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons]]). The combined institution operates today as [[NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital]]. Despite the clinical alliance, the faculty and instructional functions of the Cornell and Columbia units remain distinct and independent. Multiple fellowships and clinical programs have merged, however, and the institutions are continuing in their efforts to bring together departments, which could enhance academic efforts, reduce costs, and increase public recognition. All hospitals in the [[NewYork-Presbyterian Healthcare System]] are affiliated with one of the two colleges.

Also in 1998, the medical college was renamed as Weill Medical College of Cornell University after receiving a substantial endowment from [[Sanford I. Weill]], then Chairman of [[Citigroup]].<ref name=medhist/>

Curtiss-Wright built this lab facility located in the suburbs of [[Buffalo, New York]] as a part of the [[World War II]] effort. As a part of its tax planning in the wake of the war effort, Curtiss-Wright donated the facility to [[Cornell University]] to operate "as a public trust" and received a charitable tax deduction.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://cdsun.library.cornell.edu/cgi-bin/newscornell?a=d&srpos=6&cl=search&d=CDS19451221.2.1.6&e=--------20--1----Cornell+Aeronautical+Laboratory-all|title=Curtiss-Wright Corp.

During the late 1960s and early 1970s, universities came under criticism for conducting war-related research particularly as the [[Vietnam War]] became unpopular, and [[Cornell University]] tried to sever its ties.

===Willard Straight Hall Takeover===
[[File:Willardstraighhall edited.jpg|150px|right|thumb|Willard Straight Hall]]
On April 19, 1969, during a parents' weekend, over 80 members of Cornell's Afro-American Society took over the student union building, [[Willard Straight Hall]]. The takeover was precipitated by increasing racial tension at the university and the students' frustration with the administration's lack of support for a black studies program. The specific catalysts for the takeover were a reprimand of three black students for an incident the previous December<ref>{{cite news|url=http://cdsun.library.cornell.edu/cgi-bin/newscornell?a=d&d=CDS19690418.2.1.5&e=--------20--1----Barton+Hall+protest-all|title=Board Reprimands 3 Blacks, Gives No Penalties to Two|authors=Richard Warshauer and Mark Goldman|date=April 18, 1969|work=Cornell Daily Sun|page=1|accessdate=2009-11-24}}</ref> and a cross burning in front of the black women's cooperative and other cases of alleged racism.<ref>Donald Alexander Downs, ''Cornell '69: Liberalism and the Crisis of the American University'', (Ithaca, NY.: Cornell University Press, 1999), p. 172</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://cdsun.library.cornell.edu/cgi-bin/newscornell?a=d&srpos=12&cl=search&d=CDS19690420.2.1.3&e=--------20--1----Straight+Takeover-all|first=Barton|last=Reppert|title=Day Hall, Faculty consider official response|work=Cornell Daily Sun|date=April 20, 1969|page=1|accessdate=2009-11-24}}</ref>

By the following day a deal was brokered between the students and university officials, and on April 20, the takeover ended, with the administration ceding to some of the Afro-American Society's demands. The students emerged making a black-power salute and with guns in hand (the guns had been brought into Willard Straight Hall after the initial takeover). [[James A. Perkins]], president of Cornell during the events, would resign soon after the crisis.

Some of the elements of the deal required faculty approval, and the faculty voted to uphold the reprimands of the three students on April 21.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://cdsun.library.cornell.edu/cgi-bin/newscornell?a=d&d=CDS19690422.2.1.2&e=--------20--1----Barton+Hall+protest-all|title=Faculty Takes Controversial Stand|work=Cornell Daily Sun|date=April 22, 1969|page=1|authors=Betty Mills and Richard Warshauer|accessdate=2009-11-24}}</ref> The faculty was asked to reconsider, and a group of 2,000<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cdsun.library.cornell.edu/cgi-bin/newscornell?a=d&d=CDS19690424.2.1.2&e=--------20--1----Barton+Hall+protest-all|title=Perkins Cheered by Barton Throng After Faculty Drops Penalties|date=April 24, 1969|first=Richard|last=Neubauer|page=1|work=Cornell Daily Sun|accessdate=2009-11-24}}</ref> to 10,000 gathered in Barton Hall to debate the matter as the faculty deliberated.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cdsun.library.cornell.edu/cgi-bin/newscornell?a=d&srpos=4&cl=search&d=CDS19690425.2.1.3&e=--------20--1----Barton+Hall+protest-all|title=5,000 Attend Barton Teach-in on Racism|work=Cornell Daily Sun|date=April 25, 1969|page=1|accessdate=2009-11-24|author=Ronnie Mann and Richard Neubauer}}</ref>  This "Barton Hall Community" formed a representative Constituent Assembly which undertook a comprehensive review of the University.  Among the changes stemming from the crisis were the founding of an [[Cornell Africana Studies and Research Center|Africana Studies and Research Center]], an overhaul of the campus judicial system, and the addition of students to Cornell's Board of Trustees. The crisis also prompted New York to enact the Henderson Law requiring every college in the State to adopt rules for the maintenance of public order.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://cdsun.library.cornell.edu/cgi-bin/newscornell?a=d&srpos=23&cl=search&d=CDS19690910.2.1.6&e=--------20--21----Henderson+Law+Public+Order-all|title=New Regulations Approved|work=Cornell Daily Sun|volume=86|number=1|date=10 September 1969|page=1|first=Richard|last=Warshauer|accessdate=2011-01-01}}</ref>

[[Yale]] Professor [[Donald Kagan]], at Cornell through 1969 (1958<U+2013>69) was once a [[liberal democrat]], but he changed his views in 1969 and became one of the original signers to the 1997 Statement of Principles by the [[neoconservative]] think tank [[Project for the New American Century]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newamericancentury.org/statementofprinciples.htm |title=Statement of Principles |publisher=Newamericancentury.org |date=1997-06-03 |accessdate=2011-11-28}}</ref> According to Jim Lobe, cited in ''[[The Fall of the House of Bush]]'' by [[Craig Unger]] (p.&nbsp;39, n.), Kagan's turn away from liberalism occurred in 1969 when Cornell University was pressured into starting a "Black Studies" program by gun-wielding students seizing  [[Willard Straight Hall]] on campus: "Watching administrators demonstrate all the courage of Neville Chamberlain had a great impact on me, and I became much more conservative." On the eve of the 2000 presidential elections, Kagan and his son, [[Frederick Kagan]], published [[While America Sleeps]], a call to increase defense spending.

==Interdisciplinary studies==
Historically, Cornell's colleges have operated with great autonomy, each with a separate admissions policy, separate faculty, separate fundraising staff and in many cases, separate tuition structure.  However, the University has taken steps to encourage collaboration between related academic fields within the University and with outside organizations. In the 1960s, the University created a Division of Biological Sciences to unify related programs in the Art and Agriculture colleges.  Although a success, the structure was ultimately dropped in 1999 due to difficulty with funding.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://theuniversityfaculty.cornell.edu/forums/pdfs/bioscifoote.pdf|title=Comments on the Division of Biological Sciences|first=R. H.|last=Foote|date=October 21, 1998|accessdate=2010-01-24}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.scienceblog.com/community/older/archives/I/corn1637.html|title=Rawlings decides on reorganization for biological sciences|date=1998-11-17|accessdate=2010-01-24}} {{Dead link|date=April 2012|bot=H3llBot}}</ref>

A "Faculty of Computing and Information Science" was established in 1999 to unify computer science efforts throughout the University.  This structure obviates the need for a separate school or college of computer science. For its first ten years, [[Robert Lee Constable|Robert Constable]] served as its Dean.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.news.cornell.edu/stories/June08/Constable.ws.html|title=Robert Constable, founding dean of computing and information science, will step down in 2009|date=June 11, 2008|first=Bill |last=Steele|accessdate=2010-01-24}}</ref>

==Affordability and use of the endowment==
Since the 1970s, tuition at Cornell and other Ivy League schools has grown much faster than inflation.  This trend coincided with the creation of Federally guaranteed student loan programs.  At the same time, the endowments of these schools continue to grow due to gifts and successful investments.  Critics called for universities to keep their tuition at affordable levels and to not hoard endowment earnings.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.businessweek.com/bwdaily/dnflash/content/mar2009/db2009031_932517.htm?chan=top+news_economics+subindex+page_economics|title=Academic Endowments: The Curse of Hoarded Treasure|first=Peter (Cornell alumnus)|last=Coy|work=Business Week|date=March 1, 2009|accessdate=2010-02-01|quote= trustees may solicit funds for endowment rather than current spending simply because they like the idea of presiding over a big pile of money}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.boston.com/news/nation/articles/2008/02/28/colleges_guard_soaring_endowments/|title=Colleges guard soaring endowments|work=Boston Globe|first=Peter |last=Schworm|date=February 28, 2008|accessdate=2010-02-01}}</ref>  As a result, in 2008, Cornell and other Ivy Schools decided to increase the spending of endowment earnings in order to subsidize tuition for low and middle income families, reducing the amount of debt that Cornell students will incur.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.news.cornell.edu/stories/Jan08/finAid.html|title=Cornell drops need-based loans for students from families earning under $75,000|work=Cornell Chronicle|date=Jan. 31, 2008|accessdate=2010-02-01}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.news.cornell.edu/stories/Jan10/TuitionFollowUp.html|title=Financial aid offsets tuition increase for neediest students, says provost|first=Susan |last=Kelley|work=Cornell Chronicle|date=Jan. 29, 2010|accessdate=2010-02-01}}</ref> Cornell also placed a priority to soliciting endowed scholarships for undergraduates.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.news.cornell.edu/Chronicle/99/1.28.99/financial_aid.html|title=CU announces changes in financial aid policy to enhance affordability|first=Jacquie |last=Powers|work=Cornell Chronicle|date=Jan. 28, 1999|accessdate=2009-11-28}}</ref> In fall 2007, Cornell had 1,863 undergraduates (14% of all undergraduates) receiving federal [[Pell Grant]]s. Cornell's Pell Grant students roughly totals the combined Pell Grant recipients studying at Harvard, Princeton and Yale.<ref>"Your Gift Matters" Cornell University. 2009.</ref>

==Portrayal in fiction==
Students and faculty have chronicled Cornell in works of fiction.  The most notable was ''The Widening Stain'' which first appeared anonymously.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://cdsun.library.cornell.edu/cgi-bin/newscornell?a=d&srpos=156&cl=search&d=CDS19420202.2.1.7&e=--------20--141----Cornell+Alumni+Magazine-all|title=Cornellians Blush as Mystery Novel Satirizes Campus; Anonymous Author Hits Faculty, Officers, Architecture|date=February 2, 1944|work=Cornell Daily Sun|page=1|volume=62|number=91|accessdate=2010-12-16}}</ref> It was since revealed to have been written by [[Morris Bishop]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.amazon.com/dp/1601870086|title=The Widening Stain|publisher=Amazon.com|accessdate=2010-12-16}}</ref> [[Alison Lurie]] wrote a fictional account of the campus during the [[Vietnam War]] protests called ''[[The War Between the Tates]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.amazon.com/dp/0380711354|title=The War Between The Tates|publisher=Amazon.com|accessdate=2010-12-16}}</ref> [[Matt Ruff]] captured Cornell around 1985 in ''[[The Fool on the Hill]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.amazon.com/dp/0802135358|title=Fool on the Hill|publisher=Amazon.com|accessdate=2010-12-16}}</ref> [[Richard Fari<U+00F1>a]] wrote a novel based on a real 1958 protest led by [[Kirkpatrick Sale]] against in loco parentis policies in ''[[Been Down So Long It Looks Like Up to Me]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.amazon.com/dp/0140189300|title=Been Down So Long It Looks Like Up to Me|publisher=Amazon.com|accessdate=2010-12-16}}</ref>
