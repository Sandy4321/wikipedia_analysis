{{Financial crisis}}

The US '''subprime mortgage crisis''' was one of the first indicators of the [[Financial crisis of 2007<U+2013>2010|2007<U+2013>2010 financial crisis]], characterized by a rise in subprime mortgage delinquencies and foreclosures, and the resulting decline of securities backing said mortgages.

Approximately 80% of U.S. mortgages issued to subprime borrowers were [[adjustable-rate mortgage]]s.<ref name="DODD">{{cite web |url=http://dodd.senate.gov/?q=node/3731 |title=Senator Dodd: Create, Sustain, Preserve, and Protect the American Dream of Home Ownership |publisher=DODD |date=2007-02-07 |accessdate=2009-02-18}}</ref> After U.S. house prices peaked in mid-2006 and began their steep decline thereafter, [[refinancing]] became more difficult. As adjustable-rate mortgages began to reset at higher rates, mortgage delinquencies soared. Securities backed with mortgages, including subprime mortgages, widely held by financial firms, lost most of their value. Global investors also drastically reduced purchases of mortgage-backed debt and other securities.  In addition to causing increased delinquencies and foreclosures in subprime mortgages (along with all other types of mortgages including Alt-A and conforming), the [[Financial crisis of 2007<U+2013>2010|2007<U+2013>2010 financial crisis]] caused a decline in the capacity and willingness of the private financial system to support lending, tightening credit around the world and slowing economic growth in the U.S. and Europe.

The immediate cause or trigger of the crisis was the bursting of the [[United States housing bubble]] which peaked in approximately 2005<U+2013>2006.<ref name="Moyers Morgenson">{{cite episode | title = Episode 06292007 | series = [[Bill Moyers Journal]] | network = [[PBS]] | transcripturl = http://www.pbs.org/moyers/journal/06292007/transcript5.html | airdate = 2007-06-29}}</ref><ref name="WSJ Housing Bubble Burst">{{cite news | author = Justin Lahart | title=Egg Cracks Differ In Housing, Finance Shells | work = [[WSJ.com]] | publisher=Wall Street Journal | url=http://online.wsj.com/article/SB119845906460548071.html?mod=googlenews_wsj | date = 2007-12-24 | accessdate = 2008-07-13 }}</ref> High default rates on "[[subprime lending|subprime]]" and [[adjustable rate mortgage]]s (ARM), began to increase quickly thereafter. An increase in loan incentives such as easy initial terms and a long-term trend of rising housing prices had encouraged borrowers to assume difficult mortgages in the belief they would be able to quickly refinance at more favorable terms.  Additionally, the economic incentives provided to the originators of subprime mortgages, along with outright fraud, increased the number of subprime mortgages provided to consumers who would have otherwise qualified for conforming loans.  However, once [[interest rate]]s began to rise and housing prices started to drop moderately in 2006<U+2013>2007 in many parts of the U.S., refinancing became more difficult. [[default (finance)|Defaults]] and [[foreclosure]] activity increased dramatically as easy initial terms expired, home prices failed to go up as anticipated, and ARM interest rates reset higher. Falling prices also resulted in 23% of U.S. homes worth less than the mortgage loan by September 2010, providing a financial incentive for borrowers to enter foreclosure.<ref>[https://www.wellsfargo.com/downloads/pdf/com/research/economic_commentary/efc09172010.pdf Wells Fargo Economic Research-Weekly Economic and Financial Commentary-September 17, 2010]</ref> The ongoing foreclosure epidemic, of which subprime loans are one part, that began in late 2006 in the U.S. continues to be a key factor in the global economic crisis, because it drains wealth from consumers and erodes the financial strength of banking institutions.

In the years leading up to the crisis, significant amounts of foreign money flowed into the U.S. from fast-growing economies in Asia and oil-producing countries. This inflow of funds combined with low U.S. interest rates from 2002-2004 contributed to easy credit conditions, which fueled both housing and credit bubbles. Loans of various types (e.g., mortgage, credit card, and auto) were easy to obtain and consumers assumed an unprecedented debt load.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bernanke20090414a.htm |title=Bernanke-Four Questions About the Financial Crisis |publisher=Federalreserve.gov |date=2009-04-14 |accessdate=2010-10-03}}</ref><ref>[http://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/02/opinion/02krugman.html?_r=1 Krugman-Revenge of the Glut]</ref> As part of the housing and credit booms, the amount of financial agreements called [[mortgage-backed securities]] (MBS), which derive their value from mortgage payments and housing prices, greatly increased. Such [[financial innovation]] enabled institutions and investors around the world to invest in the U.S. housing market. As housing prices declined, major global financial institutions that had borrowed and invested heavily in MBS reported significant losses. Defaults and losses on other loan types also increased significantly as the crisis expanded from the housing market to other parts of the economy. Total losses are estimated in the trillions of U.S. dollars globally.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/weo/2009/01/pdf/exesum.pdf |title=IMF Loss Estimates |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2010-10-03}}</ref>

While the housing and credit bubbles were growing, a series of factors caused the financial system to become increasingly fragile. Policymakers did not recognize the increasingly important role played by financial institutions such as [[investment banks]] and [[hedge funds]], also known as the [[shadow banking system]]. Some experts believe these institutions had become as important as commercial (depository) banks in providing credit to the U.S. economy, but they were not subject to the same regulations.<ref name="newyorkfed.org">{{cite web|url=http://www.newyorkfed.org/newsevents/speeches/2008/tfg080609.html |title=Geithner-Speech Reducing Systemic Risk in a Dynamic Financial System |publisher=Newyorkfed.org |date=2008-06-09 |accessdate=2010-10-03}}</ref> These institutions as well as certain regulated banks had also assumed significant debt burdens while providing the loans described above and did not have a financial cushion sufficient to absorb large loan defaults or MBS losses.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/9c158a92-1a3c-11de-9f91-0000779fd2ac.html |title=Greenspan-We Need a Better Cushion Against Risk |publisher=Ft.com |date=2009-03-26 |accessdate=2010-10-03}}</ref> These losses impacted the ability of financial institutions to lend, slowing economic activity. Concerns regarding the stability of key financial institutions drove central banks to take action to provide funds to encourage lending and to restore faith in the [[commercial paper]] markets, which are integral to funding business operations. Governments also [[bailout|bailed out]] key financial institutions, assuming significant additional financial commitments.

The risks to the broader economy created by the housing market downturn and subsequent financial market crisis were primary factors in several decisions by central banks around the world to cut interest rates and governments to implement economic stimulus packages. Effects on global stock markets due to the crisis have been dramatic.  Between 1 January and 11 October 2008, owners of stocks in U.S. corporations had suffered about $8 trillion in losses, as their holdings declined in value from $20 trillion to $12 trillion.

==Causes==

The crisis can be attributed to a number of factors pervasive in both housing and [[Bond market|credit markets]], factors which emerged over a number of years. Causes proposed include the inability of homeowners to make their mortgage payments (due primarily to adjustable-rate mortgages resetting, borrowers overextending, [[predatory lending]], and [[speculation]]), overbuilding during the boom period, risky mortgage products, high personal and corporate debt levels, financial products that distributed and perhaps concealed the risk of mortgage default, bad monetary and housing policies, international [[Balance of trade|trade imbalances]], and inappropriate government regulation.<ref>{{cite news|author=By Joseph Stiglitz Special to CNN |url=http://www.cnn.com/2008/POLITICS/09/17/stiglitz.crisis/index.html |title=Time-Stiglitz |publisher=Cnn.com |date=2008-09-17 |accessdate=2009-02-27}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Steverman |first=Ben |url=http://www.businessweek.com/investor/content/oct2008/pi20081017_950382.htm?chan=top+news_top+news+index+-+temp_top+story |title=Business Week-The Financial Crisis Blame Game |publisher=Businessweek.com |date=2008-10-18 |accessdate=2009-02-27}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Roubini |first=Nouriel |url=http://www.foreignpolicy.com/story/cms.php?story_id=4591 |title=Roubini - More Doom Ahead |publisher=Foreignpolicy.com |date= |accessdate=2009-02-27}}</ref><ref>{{cite conference|first=M.

{{quote|During a period of strong global growth, growing capital flows, and prolonged stability earlier this decade, market participants sought higher yields without an adequate appreciation of the risks and failed to exercise proper due diligence. At the same time, weak underwriting standards, unsound risk management practices, increasingly complex and opaque financial products, and consequent excessive leverage combined to create vulnerabilities in the system. Policy-makers, regulators and supervisors, in some advanced countries, did not adequately appreciate and address the risks building up in financial markets, keep pace with financial innovation, or take into account the systemic ramifications of domestic regulatory actions.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2008/11/20081115-1.html |title=Declaration of G20 |publisher=Whitehouse.gov |date= |accessdate=2009-02-27}}</ref>}}

This credit and house price explosion led to a building boom and eventually to a surplus of unsold homes, which caused U.S. housing prices to peak and begin declining in mid-2006.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www2.standardandpoors.com/spf/pdf/index/CSHomePrice_Release_123062.pdf |title=Case Shiller Housing Price Index-Dec 08 |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2010-10-03}}</ref> Easy credit, and a belief that house prices would continue to appreciate, had encouraged many subprime borrowers to obtain [[adjustable-rate mortgage]]s. These mortgages enticed borrowers with a below market interest rate for some predetermined period, followed by market interest rates for the remainder of the mortgage's term. Borrowers who could not make the higher payments once the initial grace period ended would try to refinance their mortgages. Refinancing became more difficult, once house prices began to decline in many parts of the USA.  Borrowers who found themselves unable to escape higher monthly payments by refinancing began to default.

As more borrowers stop paying their mortgage payments (this is an on-going crisis), foreclosures and the supply of homes for sale increases. This places downward pressure on housing prices, which further lowers homeowners' [[Negative equity|equity]]. The decline in mortgage payments also reduces the value of [[mortgage-backed securities]], which erodes the net worth and financial health of banks. This [[vicious cycle]] is at the heart of the crisis.<ref>{{cite news|last=Feldstein |first=Martin |url=http://online.wsj.com/article/SB122697004441035727.html |title=NYT - How to Help People Whose Homes are Underwater |publisher=Online.wsj.com |date=2008-11-18 |accessdate=2009-02-27}}</ref>

During 2005, these figures were 28% and 12%, respectively. In other words, a record level of nearly 40% of homes purchases were not intended as primary residences. David Lereah, [[National Association of Realtors|NAR]]'s chief economist at the time, stated that the 2006 decline in investment buying was expected: "Speculators left the market in 2006, which caused investment sales to fall much faster than the primary market."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://money.cnn.com/2007/04/30/real_estate/speculators_fleeing_housing_markets/index.htm|title=Speculation statistics | work=CNN | date=2007-04-30 | accessdate=2010-05-24 | first1=Les | last1=Christie}}</ref>

Housing prices nearly doubled between 2000 and 2006, a vastly different trend from the historical appreciation at roughly the rate of inflation. While homes had not traditionally been treated as investments subject to speculation, this behavior changed during the housing boom. Media widely reported condominiums being purchased while under construction, then being "flipped" (sold) for a profit without the seller ever having lived in them.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.local10.com/news/4277615/detail.html|title=Speculative flipping}}</ref> Some mortgage companies identified risks inherent in this activity as early as 2005, after identifying investors assuming highly leveraged positions in multiple properties.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://realtytimes.com/rtpages/20050321_tighterrules.htm|title=Speculation Risks}}</ref>

In addition to considering higher-risk borrowers, lenders have offered increasingly risky loan options and borrowing incentives.

The mortgage qualification guidelines began to change. At first, the stated income, verified assets (SIVA) loans came out. Proof of income was no longer needed. Borrowers just needed to "state" it and show that they had money in the bank. Then, the no income, verified assets (NIVA) loans came out. The lender no longer required proof of employment. Borrowers just needed to show proof of money in their bank accounts. The qualification guidelines kept getting looser in order to produce more mortgages and more securities. This led to the creation of NINA. NINA is an abbreviation of No Income No Assets (sometimes referred to as [[Ninja loans]]).  Basically, NINA loans are official loan products and let you borrow money without having to prove or even state any owned assets. All that was required for a mortgage was a credit score.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stock-market-investors.com/stock-investment-risk/the-subprime-mortgage-crisis-explained.html |title=The Subprime Mortgage Crisis Explained |publisher=Stock-market-investors.com |date= |accessdate=2010-10-03}}</ref>

Another example is the interest-only adjustable-rate mortgage (ARM), which allows the homeowner to pay just the interest (not principal) during an initial period. Still another is a "payment option" loan, in which the homeowner can pay a variable amount, but any interest not paid is added to the principal. An estimated one-third of ARMs originated between 2004 and 2006 had "teaser" rates below 4%, which then increased significantly after some initial period, as much as doubling the monthly payment.<ref name="NPR-Brace"/>

The proportion of subprime ARM loans made to people with credit scores high enough to qualify for conventional mortgages with better terms increased from 41% in 2000 to 61% by 2006. However, there are many factors other than credit score that affect lending. In addition, mortgage brokers in some cases received incentives from lenders to offer subprime ARM's even to those with credit ratings that merited a conforming (i.e., non-subprime) loan.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.realestatejournal.com/buysell/mortgages/20071204-simon.html |title=WSJ - Subprime Debacle Traps Even Credit Worthy |publisher=Realestatejournal.com |date=2007-12-04 |accessdate=2009-02-27}}</ref>

So why did lending standards decline? In a [[Peabody Award]] winning program, [[National Public Radio|NPR]] correspondents argued that a "Giant Pool of Money" (represented by $70 trillion in worldwide fixed income investments) sought higher yields than those offered by U.S. Treasury bonds early in the decade. Further, this pool of money had roughly doubled in size from 2000 to 2007, yet the supply of relatively safe, income generating investments had not grown as fast. Investment banks on Wall Street answered this demand with [[financial innovation]] such as the [[mortgage-backed security]] (MBS) and [[collateralized debt obligation]] (CDO), which were assigned safe ratings by the credit rating agencies. In effect, Wall Street connected this pool of money to the mortgage market in the U.S., with enormous fees accruing to those throughout the mortgage supply chain, from the mortgage broker selling the loans, to small banks that funded the brokers, to the giant investment banks behind them. By approximately 2003, the supply of mortgages originated at traditional lending standards had been exhausted. However, continued strong demand for MBS and CDO began to drive down lending standards, as long as mortgages could still be sold along the supply chain. Eventually, this speculative bubble proved unsustainable. NPR described it this way:<ref>[http://www.pri.org/business/giant-pool-of-money.html NPR-The Giant Pool of Money]</ref>

{{quote|The problem was that even though housing prices were going through the roof, people weren't making any more money. From 2000 to 2007, the median household income stayed flat. And so the more prices rose, the more tenuous the whole thing became. No matter how lax lending standards got, no matter how many exotic mortgage products were created to shoehorn people into homes they couldn't possibly afford, no matter what the mortgage machine tried, the people just couldn't swing it. By late 2006, the average home cost nearly four times what the average family made. Historically it was between two and three times. And mortgage lenders noticed something that they'd almost never seen before. People would close on a house, sign all the mortgage papers, and then default on their very first payment. No loss of a job, no medical emergency, they were underwater before they even started. And although no one could really hear it, that was probably the moment when one of the biggest speculative bubbles in American history popped.}}

===Securitization practices ===
[[Image:Borrowing Under a Securitization Structure.gif|left|thumb|Borrowing under a securitization structure.]]
{{See|Securitization|Mortgage-backed security}}

The traditional mortgage model involved a bank originating a loan to the borrower/homeowner and retaining the credit (default) risk. With the advent of [[securitization]], the traditional model has given way to the "originate to distribute" model, in which banks essentially sell the mortgages and distribute credit risk to investors through [[mortgage-backed securities]]. Securitization meant that those issuing mortgages were no longer required to hold them to maturity. By selling the mortgages to investors, the originating banks replenished their funds, enabling them to issue more loans and generating transaction fees. This created a [[moral hazard]] in which an increased focus on processing mortgage transactions was incentivized but ensuring their credit quality was not.<ref>{{cite news | title='Moral hazard' helps shape mortgage mess

Securitization accelerated in the mid-1990s. The total amount of mortgage-backed securities issued almost tripled between 1996 and 2007, to $7.3 trillion. The securitized share of subprime mortgages (i.e., those passed to third-party investors via MBS) increased from 54% in 2001, to 75% in 2006.<ref name = "ssrn.com-1020396"/> American homeowners, consumers, and corporations owed roughly $25 trillion during 2008. American banks retained about $8 trillion of that total directly as traditional mortgage loans. Bondholders and other traditional lenders provided another $7 trillion. The remaining $10 trillion came from the securitization markets. The securitization markets started to close down in the spring of 2007 and nearly shut-down in the fall of 2008. More than a third of the private credit markets thus became unavailable as a source of funds.<ref name="Search Site">{{cite web|author=Search Site |url=http://www.city-journal.org/2009/19_1_credit.html |title=Nicole Gelinas-Can the Fed's Uncrunch Credit? |publisher=City-journal.org |date= |accessdate=2009-02-27}}</ref><ref name="brookings.edu">[http://www.brookings.edu/papers/2009/0615_economic_crisis_baily_elliott.aspx Brookings Institute - U.S. Financial and Economic Crisis June 2009 PDF Page 14]</ref> In February 2009, [[Ben Bernanke]] stated that securitization markets remained effectively shut, with the exception of conforming mortgages, which could be sold to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.<ref>{{cite web|author=Search Site |url=http://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/testimony/bernanke20090224a.htm|title=Bernanke|date= |accessdate=2009-02-24}}</ref>

A more direct connection between securitization and the subprime crisis relates to a fundamental fault in the way that underwriters, rating agencies and investors [[Mathematical model|modeled]] the [[correlation]] of risks among loans in securitization pools.  Correlation modeling<U+2014>determining how the default risk of one loan in a pool is statistically related to the default risk for other loans<U+2014>was based on a "[[Gaussian copula]]" technique developed by statistician [[David X. Li]].  This technique, widely adopted as a means of evaluating the risk associated with securitization transactions, used what turned out to be an overly simplistic approach to correlation.  Unfortunately, the flaws in this technique did not become apparent to market participants until after many hundreds of billions of dollars of [[Asset-backed security|ABSs]] and [[Collateralized debt obligation|CDOs]] backed by subprime loans had been rated and sold.

===Inaccurate credit ratings===
{{Main|Credit rating agencies and the subprime crisis}}
[[Image:MBS Downgrades Chart.png|thumb|MBS credit rating downgrades, by quarter.]]

[[Credit rating agencies]] are now under scrutiny for having given investment-grade ratings to [[Mortgage-backed security|MBS]]s based on risky subprime mortgage loans. These high ratings enabled these MBS to be sold to investors, thereby financing the housing boom. These ratings were believed justified because of risk reducing practices, such as credit default insurance and equity investors willing to bear the first losses. However, there are also indications that some involved in rating subprime-related securities knew at the time that the rating process was faulty.<ref>{{cite web | author=US House of Representatives Committee on Government Oversight and Reform | title=Committee Holds Hearing on the Credit Rating Agencies and the Financial Crisis  | date = 22 October 2008 | url=http://oversight.house.gov/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=3437&Itemid=2 | accessdate=2010-07-09}}</ref>

Critics allege that the rating agencies suffered from conflicts of interest, as they were paid by investment banks and other firms that organize and sell structured securities to investors.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.economist.com/finance/displaystory.cfm?story_id=9769471 | title=Buttonwood &#124; Credit and blame &#124; Economist.com | publisher=Economist.com | date=6 September 2007 |accessdate=26 October 2008}}</ref> On 11 June 2008, the [[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission|SEC]] proposed rules designed to mitigate perceived conflicts of interest between rating agencies and issuers of structured securities.<ref>{{cite web | title=SEC Proposes Comprehensive Reforms to Bring Increased Transparency to Credit Rating Process | publisher=U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission | url=http://www.sec.gov/news/press/2008/2008-110.htm | accessdate=July 2008 | year=2008}}</ref> On 3 December 2008, the SEC approved measures to strengthen oversight of credit rating agencies, following a ten-month investigation that found "significant weaknesses in ratings practices," including conflicts of interest.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sec.gov/news/press/2008/2008-284.htm |title=SEC - Rating Agency Rules |publisher=Sec.gov |date=2008-12-03 |accessdate=2009-02-27}}</ref>

Between Q3 2007 and Q2 2008, rating agencies lowered the credit ratings on $1.9 trillion in [[mortgage backed securities]]. Financial institutions felt they had to lower the value of their MBS and acquire additional capital so as to maintain capital ratios. If this involved the sale of new shares of stock, the value of the existing shares was reduced. Thus ratings downgrades lowered the stock prices of many financial firms.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://money.cnn.com/2008/08/04/magazines/fortune/whitney_feature.fortune/index.htm | title=The woman who called Wall Street's meltdown | work=Fortune | date=6 August 2008 | accessdate=2010-05-24 | first=Jon | last=Birger}}</ref>

Both government failed regulation and deregulation contributed to the crisis.  In testimony before Congress both the [[Securities and Exchange Commission]] (SEC) and [[Alan Greenspan]] conceded failure in allowing the self-regulation of investment banks.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/27/business/27sec.html?em|title=SEC Concedes Oversight Flaws | work=The New York Times | first=Stephen | last=Labaton | date=2008-09-27 | accessdate=2010-05-24}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/03/business/03sec.html?em|title=The Reckoning | work=The New York Times | first=Stephen | last=Labaton | date=2008-10-03 | accessdate=2010-05-24}}</ref>

Increasing home ownership has been the goal of several presidents including Roosevelt, Reagan, Clinton and G.W.Bush.<ref>[http://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2002/10/20021015.html Whitehouse-President Hosts Conference on Minority Home Ownership-October 15, 2002]</ref>  In 1982, Congress passed the Alternative Mortgage Transactions Parity Act (AMTPA), which allowed non-federally chartered housing creditors to write adjustable-rate mortgages.  Among the new mortgage loan types created and gaining in popularity in the early 1980s were adjustable-rate, option adjustable-rate, balloon-payment and interest-only mortgages.  These new loan types are credited with replacing the long standing practice of banks making conventional fixed-rate, amortizing mortgages.  Among the criticisms of banking industry deregulation that contributed to the [[savings and loan crisis]] was that Congress failed to enact regulations that would have prevented exploitations by these loan types.  Subsequent widespread abuses of predatory lending occurred with the use of adjustable-rate mortgages.<ref name="DODD"/><ref name="The downturn in facts and figures"/><ref>{{cite news|url=http://money.cnn.com/2008/01/30/real_estate/congress_subprime.fortune/ |title=How Congress helped create the subprime mess |publisher=CNNMoney.com |author=Jon Birger |date=Published: January 31, 2008 |accessdate=2009-04-02}}</ref>  Approximately 80% of subprime mortgages are adjustable-rate mortgages.<ref name="DODD"/>

In 1995, the GSEs like Fannie Mae began receiving government tax incentives for purchasing mortgage backed securities which included loans to low income borrowers.

Fannie Mae had stopped buying Alt-A products in the early 1990s because of the high risk of default.

The [[Glass-Steagall Act]] was enacted after the [[Great Depression]]. It separated [[commercial bank]]s and [[investment bank]]s, in part to avoid potential conflicts of interest between the lending activities of the former and rating activities of the latter.  Economist [[Joseph Stiglitz]] criticized the repeal of the Act. He called its repeal the "culmination of a $300 million lobbying effort by the banking and financial services industries...spearheaded in Congress by Senator [[Phil Gramm]]."  He believes it contributed to this crisis because the risk-taking culture of investment banking dominated the more conservative commercial banking culture, leading to increased levels of risk-taking and leverage during the boom period.<ref name="vanityfair.com">[http://www.vanityfair.com/magazine/2009/01/stiglitz200901 Stiglitz - Vanity Fair - Capitalist Fools]</ref>  The Federal government bailout of [[Savings and loan association|thrifts]] during the [[savings and loan crisis]] of the late 1980s may have encouraged other lenders to make risky loans, and thus given rise to [[moral hazard]].<ref name="brown1"/><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=16734629| title=Subprime Bailout: Good Idea or 'Moral Hazard|first=Eric |last=Weiner|date=29 November 2007|publisher=NPR.org}}</ref>

Economist [[Paul Krugman]] argued in January 2010 that the simultaneous growth of the residential and commercial real estate pricing bubbles undermines the case made by those who argue that [[Fannie Mae]], [[Freddie Mac]], CRA or predatory lending were primary causes of the crisis. In other words, bubbles in both markets developed even though only the residential market was affected by these potential causes.<ref>[http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/01/07/cre-ative-destruction/ Krugman-CREative Destruction-NYT-January 2010]</ref>

===Policies of central banks===
[[File:Fed Funds Rate & Mortgage Rates 2001 to 2008.png|thumb|right|Federal Funds Rate and Various Mortgage Rates]]
[[Central bank]]s manage monetary policy and may target the rate of inflation. They have some authority over [[commercial bank]]s and possibly other financial institutions. They are less concerned with avoiding asset [[price bubble]]s, such as the [[housing bubble]] and [[dot-com bubble]]. Central banks have generally chosen to react after such bubbles burst so as to minimize collateral damage to the economy, rather than trying to prevent or stop the bubble itself. This is because identifying an asset bubble and determining the proper monetary policy to deflate it are matters of debate among economists.<ref name="WallStreetJournal">{{cite web | title = The Wall Street Journal Online - Featured Article | url=http://opinionjournal.com/editorial/feature.html?id=110010981 | accessdate=2008-05-19 | year = 2008 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news | title = Assets and their liabilities | publisher=Economist.com | url=http://www.economist.com/specialreports/displaystory.cfm?story_id=9972549 | accessdate=2008-05-19 | year = 2008 | date=2007-10-18}}</ref>

A contributing factor to the rise in house prices was the Federal Reserve's lowering of interest rates early in the decade. From 2000 to 2003, the Federal Reserve lowered the [[federal funds rate]] target from 6.5% to 1.0%.<ref>{{cite web | title = Federal Reserve Board: Monetary Policy and Open Market Operations | url=http://www.federalreserve.gov/fomc/fundsrate.htm | accessdate=2008-05-19}}</ref> This was done to soften the effects of the collapse of the [[dot-com bubble]] and of the [[September 11 attacks|September 2001 terrorist attacks]], and to combat the perceived risk of [[deflation]].<ref name="WallStreetJournal" /> The Fed believed that interest rates could be lowered safely primarily because the rate of [[inflation]] was low; it disregarded other important factors. Richard W. Fisher, President and CEO of the [[Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas]], said that the Fed's interest rate policy during the early 2000s was misguided, because measured inflation in those years was below true inflation, which led to a monetary policy that contributed to the housing bubble.<ref>{{cite web | author = Richard W.

===Financial institution debt levels and incentives===
[[Image:Leverage Ratios.png|thumb|Leverage Ratios of Investment Banks Increased Significantly 2003<U+2013>2007]]

Many [[financial institutions]], [[investment bank]]s in particular, issued large amounts of debt during 2004<U+2013>2007, and invested the proceeds in [[mortgage-backed securities]] (MBS), essentially betting that house prices would continue to rise, and that households would continue to make their mortgage payments.  Borrowing at a lower interest rate and investing the proceeds at a higher interest rate is a form of [[financial leverage]]. This is analogous to an individual taking out a second mortgage on his residence to invest in the stock market. This strategy proved profitable during the housing boom, but resulted in large losses when house prices began to decline and mortgages began to default. Beginning in 2007, financial institutions and individual investors holding MBS also suffered significant losses from mortgage payment defaults and the resulting decline in the value of MBS.<ref name="newleftreview1">Robin Blackburn, [http://www.newleftreview.org/?getpdf=NLR28403&pdflang=en Subprime Crisis], [[New Left Review]], March<U+2013>April 2008.</ref>

A 2004 [[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission]] (SEC) decision related to the [[net capital rule]] allowed USA investment banks to issue substantially more debt, which was then used to purchase MBS. Over 2004-07, the top five US investment banks each significantly increased their financial leverage (see diagram), which increased their vulnerability to the declining value of MBSs. These five institutions reported over $4.1 trillion in debt for fiscal year 2007, about 30% of USA nominal GDP for 2007. Further, the percentage of subprime mortgages originated to total originations increased from below 10% in 2001-2003 to between 18-20% from 2004<U+2013>2006, due in-part to financing from investment banks.<ref name="blogspot1"/><ref name="publications2"/>

During 2008, three of the largest U.S. investment banks either went bankrupt ([[Lehman Brothers]]) or were sold at fire sale prices to other banks ([[Bear Stearns]] and [[Merrill Lynch]]). These failures augmented the instability in the global financial system. The remaining two investment banks, [[Morgan Stanley]] and [[Goldman Sachs]], opted to become commercial banks, thereby subjecting themselves to more stringent regulation.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/03/business/03sec.html|title=Agency's <U+2019>04 Rule Let Banks Pile Up New Debt, and Risk | work=The New York Times | first=Stephen | last=Labaton | date=2008-10-03 | accessdate=2010-05-24}}</ref><ref>[http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2008/09/28/business/20080928-SEC-multimedia/index.html NYT The Day the SEC Changed the Game-September 28, 2008]</ref>

In the years leading up to the crisis, the top four U.S. depository banks moved an estimated $5.2 trillion in assets and liabilities [[off-balance sheet]] into [[special purpose entity|special purpose vehicles]] or other entities in the [[shadow banking system]]. This enabled them to essentially bypass existing regulations regarding minimum capital ratios, thereby increasing leverage and profits during the boom but increasing losses during the crisis. New accounting guidance will require them to put some of these assets back onto their books during 2009, which will significantly reduce their capital ratios. One news agency estimated this amount to be between $500 billion and $1 trillion. This effect was considered as part of the stress tests performed by the government during 2009.<ref>[http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601039&sid=akv_p6LBNIdw&refer=home Bloomberg-Banks $1 trillion purge]</ref>

[[Martin Wolf]] wrote in June 2009: "...an enormous part of what banks did in the early part of this decade <U+2013> the off-balance-sheet vehicles, the derivatives and the 'shadow banking system' itself <U+2013> was to find a way round regulation."<ref>[http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/095722f6-6028-11de-a09b-00144feabdc0.html FT Martin Wolf - Reform of Regulation and Incentives]</ref>

The New York State Comptroller's Office has said that in 2006, Wall Street executives took home bonuses totaling $23.9 billion. "Wall Street traders were thinking of the bonus at the end of the year, not the long-term health of their firm. The whole system<U+2014>from mortgage brokers to Wall Street risk managers<U+2014>seemed tilted toward taking short-term risks while ignoring long-term obligations. The most damning evidence is that most of the people at the top of the banks didn't really understand how those [investments] worked."<ref name="businessweek1"/><ref>[http://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/21/business/21nocera.html?_r=1&ref=business NYT-Nocera-First, Let's Fix the Bonuses]</ref>

Investment banker incentive compensation was focused on fees generated from assembling financial products, rather than the performance of those products and profits generated over time. Their bonuses were heavily skewed towards cash rather than stock and not subject to "claw-back" (recovery of the bonus from the employee by the firm) in the event the MBS or CDO created did not perform. In addition, the increased risk (in the form of financial leverage) taken by the major investment banks was not adequately factored into the compensation of senior executives.<ref>[http://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/18/business/18pay.html?em NYT-Reckoning-Profits Illusory, Bonuses Real]</ref>

===Credit default swaps===
[[Credit default swaps]] (CDS) are financial instruments used as a hedge and protection for debtholders, in particular MBS investors, from the risk of default. As the net worth of banks and other financial institutions deteriorated because of losses related to subprime mortgages, the likelihood increased that those providing the insurance would have to pay their counterparties. This created uncertainty across the system, as investors wondered which companies would be required to pay to cover mortgage defaults.

Like all [[swap (finance)|swaps]] and other [[financial derivative]]s, CDS may either be used to [[Hedge (finance)|hedge]] risks (specifically, to insure creditors against default) or to profit from [[speculation]]. The volume of CDS outstanding increased 100-fold from 1998 to 2008, with estimates of the debt covered by CDS contracts, as of November 2008, ranging from US$33 to $47 trillion. CDS are lightly regulated. As of 2008, there was no central [[Clearing house (finance)|clearing house]] to honor CDS in the event a party to a CDS proved unable to perform his obligations under the CDS contract. Required disclosure of CDS-related obligations has been criticized as inadequate. Insurance companies such as [[American International Group]] (AIG), [[MBIA]], and [[Ambac]] faced ratings downgrades because widespread mortgage defaults increased their potential exposure to CDS losses. These firms had to obtain additional funds (capital) to offset this exposure. AIG's having CDSs insuring $440 billion of MBS resulted in its seeking and obtaining a Federal government bailout.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601109&sid=aKKRHZsxRvWs&refer=home |title=Bloomberg-Credit Swap Disclosure Obscures True Financial Risk |publisher=Bloomberg.com |date=2008-11-06 |accessdate=2009-02-27}}</ref>

When investment bank [[Lehman Brothers]] went bankrupt in September 2008, there was much uncertainty as to which financial firms would be required to honor the CDS contracts on its $600 billion of bonds outstanding.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.ibtimes.com/articles/20081010/lehman-debt-auction-gives-clue-to-potential-losses.htm | title=AP - Lehman Debt Auction Gives Clue to Potential Losses | agency=Associated Press | author=Stephen Bernard | date=October 10, 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.secinfo.com/d11MXs.t1C1k.htm#1stPage | title=Lehman 10Q May 08 | publisher=Lehman Brothers }}</ref>
[[Merrill Lynch]]'s large losses in 2008 were attributed in part to the drop in value of its unhedged portfolio of [[collateralized debt obligation]]s (CDOs) after [[AIG]] ceased offering CDS on Merrill's CDOs. The loss of confidence of trading partners in Merrill Lynch's solvency and its ability to refinance its short-term debt led to its acquisition by the [[Bank of America]].<ref name='NYT-Morgenson-2008-11-08'>

Economist [[Joseph Stiglitz]] summarized how credit default swaps contributed to the systemic meltdown: "With this complicated intertwining of bets of great magnitude, no one could be sure of the financial position of anyone else-or even of one's own position. Not surprisingly, the credit markets froze."<ref>{{cite web|last=Stiglitz |first=Joseph E. |url=http://www.vanityfair.com/magazine/2009/01/stiglitz200901 |title=Stiglitz - Vanity Fair - Capitalist Fools |publisher=Vanity Fair |date= |accessdate=2009-02-27}}</ref>

Author [[Michael Lewis (author)|Michael Lewis]] wrote that CDS enabled speculators to stack bets on the same mortgage bonds and CDO's. This is analogous to allowing many persons to buy insurance on the same house. Speculators that bought CDS insurance were betting that significant defaults would occur, while the sellers (such as [[AIG]]) bet they would not. A theoretically infinite amount could be wagered on the same housing-related securities, provided buyers and sellers of the CDS could be found.<ref>[http://www.vanityfair.com/business/features/2010/04/wall-street-excerpt-201004 Vanity Fair-Michael Lewis-Betting the Blind Side-April 2010]</ref>  In addition, Chicago Public Radio, Huffington Post, and ProPublica reported in April 2010 that market participants, including a hedge fund called [[Magnetar Capital]], encouraged the creation of CDO's containing low quality mortgages, so they could bet against them using CDS. NPR reported that Magnetar encouraged investors to purchase CDO's while simultaneously betting against them, without disclosing the latter bet.<ref>[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/yves-smith/rahm-emanuel-and-magnetar_b_535827.html?view=screen Huffington Post-Yves Smith-Magnetar Capital-April 2010]</ref><ref>[http://www.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/405/inside-job NPR-This American Life-Inside Job-April 2010]</ref><ref>[http://www.propublica.org/feature/all-the-magnetar-trade-how-one-hedge-fund-helped-keep-the-housing-bubble]</ref>  Instruments called [[synthetic CDO]], which are portfolios of credit default swaps, were also involved in allegations by the SEC against Goldman-Sachs in April 2010.<ref>[http://blogs.wsj.com/deals/2010/04/19/goldman-responds-again-to-sec-complaint/ WSJ-Goldman Responds Again to SEC Complaint-April 2010]</ref>

===US Balance of Payments===
[[File:U.S. Trade Deficit Dollars and % GDP.png|thumb|U.S. Current Account or Trade Deficit]]
In 2005, [[Ben Bernanke]] addressed the implications of the USA's high and rising [[current account]] deficit, resulting from USA investment exceeding its savings, or imports exceeding exports.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.federalreserve.gov/boarddocs/speeches/2005/20050414/default.htm |title=Bernanke-The Global Saving Glut and U.S. Current Account Deficit |publisher=Federalreserve.gov |date= |accessdate=2009-02-27}}</ref> Between 1996 and 2004, the USA current account deficit increased by $650 billion, from 1.5% to 5.8% of GDP. The US attracted a great deal of foreign investment, mainly from the emerging economies in Asia and oil-exporting nations. The [[balance of payments]] [[Identity (mathematics)|identity]] requires that a country (such as the USA) running a [[current account]] deficit also have a [[capital account]] (investment) surplus of the same amount. Foreign investors had these funds to lend, either because they had very high personal savings rates (as high as 40% in China), or because of high oil prices. Bernanke referred to this as a "[[saving glut]]"<ref name="Bernanke"/> that may have ''pushed'' capital into the USA, a view differing from that of some other economists, who view such capital as having been ''pulled'' into the USA by its high consumption levels. In other words, a nation cannot consume more than its income unless it sells assets to foreigners, or foreigners are willing to lend to it. Alternatively, if a nation wishes to increase domestic investment in plant and equipment, it will also increase its level of imports to maintain balance if it has a floating exchange rate.

Regardless of the push or pull view, a "flood" of funds ([[Financial capital|capital]] or [[liquidity]]) reached the USA financial markets. Foreign governments supplied funds by purchasing USA [[Treasury bond]]s and thus avoided much of the direct impact of the crisis. USA households, on the other hand, used funds borrowed from foreigners to finance consumption or to bid up the prices of housing and financial assets. Financial institutions invested foreign funds in [[mortgage-backed securities]]. USA housing and financial assets dramatically declined in value after the housing bubble burst.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.economist.com/opinion/displaystory.cfm?story_id=12972083 |title=Economist-When a Flow Becomes a Flood |publisher=Economist.com |date=2009-01-22 |accessdate=2009-02-27}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=Roger C.

===Boom and collapse of the shadow banking system===
[[File:Securitization Market Activity.png|thumb|350px|right|Securitization markets were impaired during the crisis]]
In a June 2008 speech, President of the NY Federal Reserve Bank [[Timothy Geithner]], who later became Secretary of the Treasury, placed significant blame for the freezing of credit markets on a "run" on the entities in the "parallel" banking system, also called the [[shadow banking system]]. These entities became critical to the credit markets underpinning the financial system, but were not subject to the same regulatory controls as depository banks. Further, these entities were vulnerable because they borrowed short-term in liquid markets to purchase long-term, illiquid and risky assets. This meant that disruptions in credit markets would make them subject to rapid deleveraging, selling their long-term assets at depressed prices. He described the significance of these entities: "In early 2007, asset-backed commercial paper conduits, in structured investment vehicles, in auction-rate preferred securities, tender option bonds and variable rate demand notes, had a combined asset size of roughly $2.2 trillion. Assets financed overnight in triparty repo grew to $2.5 trillion. Assets held in hedge funds grew to roughly $1.8 trillion. The combined balance sheets of the then five major investment banks totaled $4 trillion. In comparison, the total assets of the top five bank holding companies in the United States at that point were just over $6 trillion, and total assets of the entire banking system were about $10 trillion." He stated that the "combined effect of these factors was a financial system vulnerable to self-reinforcing asset price and credit cycles."<ref name="newyorkfed.org"/>

Nobel laureate [[Paul Krugman]] described the run on the shadow banking system as the "core of what happened" to cause the crisis. "As the shadow banking system expanded to rival or even surpass conventional banking in importance, politicians and government officials should have realized that they were re-creating the kind of financial vulnerability that made the Great Depression possible<U+2014>and they should have responded by extending regulations and the financial safety net to cover these new institutions. Influential figures should have proclaimed a simple rule: anything that does what a bank does, anything that has to be rescued in crises the way banks are, should be regulated like a bank." He referred to this lack of controls as "malign neglect."<ref name="Krugman 2009">{{cite book

The securitization markets supported by the shadow banking system started to close down in the spring of 2007 and nearly shut-down in the fall of 2008. More than a third of the private credit markets thus became unavailable as a source of funds.<ref name="Search Site"/> According to the [[Brookings Institution]], the traditional banking system does not have the capital to close this gap as of June 2009: "It would take a number of years of strong profits to generate sufficient capital to support that additional lending volume." The authors also indicate that some forms of securitization are "likely to vanish forever, having been an artifact of excessively loose credit conditions."<ref name="brookings.edu"/>

Economist [[Mark Zandi]] testified to the [[Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission]] in January 2010:
"The securitization markets also remain impaired, as investors anticipate more loan losses. Investors are also uncertain about coming legal and accounting rule changes and regulatory reforms. Private bond issuance of residential and commercial [[mortgage-backed securities]], [[asset-backed securities]], and [[collateralized debt obligations|CDOs]] peaked in 2006 at close to $2 trillion...In 2009, private issuance was less than $150 billion, and almost all of it was asset-backed issuance supported by the Federal Reserve's TALF program to aid credit card, auto and small-business lenders. Issuance of residential and commercial mortgage-backed securities and CDOs remains dormant."<ref>[http://www.fcic.gov/hearings/pdfs/2010-0113-Zandi.pdf Testimony of Mark Zandi to Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission-January 2010]</ref>

''[[The Economist]]'' reported in March 2010: "Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers were non-banks that were crippled by a silent run among panicky overnight "[[Repurchase agreement|repo]]" lenders, many of them money market funds uncertain about the quality of securitized collateral they were holding. Mass redemptions from these funds after Lehman's failure froze short-term funding for big firms."<ref>[http://www.economist.com/opinion/displaystory.cfm?story_id=15770705 The Economist-Shine a Light-March 25, 2010]</ref>

Between June 2007 and November 2008, Americans lost more than a quarter of their net worth. By early November 2008, a broad U.S. stock index, the S&P 500, was down 45 percent from its 2007 high.  Housing prices had dropped 20% from their 2006 peak, with futures markets signaling a 30-35% potential drop. Total home equity in the United States, which was valued at $13 trillion at its peak in 2006, had dropped to $8.8 trillion by mid-2008 and was still falling in late 2008. Total retirement assets, Americans' second-largest household asset, dropped by 22 percent, from $10.3 trillion in 2006 to $8 trillion in mid-2008. During the same period, savings and investment assets (apart from retirement savings) lost $1.2 trillion and pension assets lost $1.3 trillion.

As of August 2008, [[financial institutions|financial firms]] around the globe have [[write down|written down]] their holdings of subprime related securities by US$501 billion.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601087&sid=a8sW0n1Cs1tY&refer=home |title=Bloomberg.com: Worldwide |publisher=Bloomberg.com |date= |accessdate=2008-10-26}}</ref> The IMF estimates that financial institutions around the globe will eventually have to write off $1.5 trillion of their holdings of subprime MBSs.

Banks headquartered in nations that have signed the [[Basel Accords]] must have so many cents of [[Capital requirement|capital]] for every dollar of credit extended to consumers and businesses.

This credit freeze brought the global financial system to the brink of collapse. The response of the USA [[Federal Reserve]], the [[European Central Bank]], and other central banks was immediate and dramatic. During the last quarter of 2008, these central banks purchased US$2.5 trillion of government debt and troubled private assets from banks. This was the largest liquidity injection into the credit market, and the largest monetary policy action, in world history. The governments of European nations and the USA also raised the capital of their national banking systems by $1.5 trillion, by purchasing newly issued [[preferred stock]] in their major banks.

{{See|Subprime mortgage crisis solutions debate}}

Various actions have been taken since the crisis became apparent in August 2007. In September 2008, major instability in world financial markets increased awareness and attention to the crisis.  Various agencies and regulators, as well as political officials, began to take additional, more comprehensive steps to handle the crisis.

To date, various government agencies have committed or spent trillions of dollars in loans, asset purchases, guarantees, and direct spending.

===Federal Reserve and central banks===
{{Main|Federal Reserve responses to the subprime crisis}}

The central bank of the USA, the [[Federal Reserve]], in partnership with [[central bank]]s around the world, has taken several steps to address the crisis. Federal Reserve Chairman [[Ben Bernanke]] stated in early 2008: "Broadly, the Federal Reserve's response has followed two tracks: efforts to support [[market liquidity]] and functioning and the pursuit of our macroeconomic objectives through monetary policy."<ref name="Bernanke20080110a" />
The Fed has:
*Lowered the target for the [[Federal funds rate]] from 5.25% to 2%, and the discount rate from 5.75% to 2.25%. This took place in six steps occurring between 18 September 2007 and 30 April 2008;<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/press/monetary/20070918a.htm |title=FRB: Press Release-FOMC Statement-18 September 2007 |publisher=Federalreserve.gov |date= |accessdate=2008-10-26}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/press/monetary/20080318a.htm |title=FRB: Press Release-FOMC statement-18 March 2008 |publisher=Federalreserve.gov |date= |accessdate=2008-10-26}}</ref> In December 2008, the Fed further lowered the federal funds rate target to a range of 0-0.25% (25 basis points).<ref>[http://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bernanke20090113a.htm Bernanke-The Crisis and Policy Response]</ref>
*Undertaken, along with other central banks, [[open market operations]] to ensure member banks remain liquid. These are effectively short-term loans to member banks collateralized by government securities. Central banks have also lowered the interest rates (called the [[discount rate]] in the USA) they charge member banks for short-term loans;<ref>{{cite web | title = FRB: Speech<U+2014>Bernanke, The Recent Financial Turmoil and its Economic and Policy Consequences<U+2014>15 October 2007 | url=http://federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bernanke20071015a.htm | accessdate=2008-05-19 | year = 2008 }}</ref>
*Created a variety of lending facilities to enable the Fed to lend directly to banks and non-bank institutions, against specific types of collateral of varying credit quality. These include the [[Term Auction Facility]] (TAF) and Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility ([[TALF]]).<ref name="postversion1">{{cite news|author=By David Goldman, CNNMoney.com staff writer |url=http://money.cnn.com/2008/11/26/news/economy/where_bailout_stands/index.htm?postversion=2008112813 |title=CNN - Bailouts |publisher=Money.cnn.com |date= 2008-11-26|accessdate=2009-02-27}}</ref>
*In November 2008, the Fed announced a $600 billion program to purchase the MBS of the GSE, to help lower mortgage rates.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/press/monetary/20081125b.htm |title=Fed - GSE (Government Sponsored Enterprise) MBS purchases |publisher=Federalreserve.gov |date=2008-11-25 |accessdate=2009-02-27}}</ref>
*In March 2009, the [[FOMC]] decided to increase the size of the Federal Reserve<U+2019>s balance sheet further by purchasing up to an additional $750 billion of agency ([[Government-sponsored enterprise|GSE]]) mortgage-backed securities, bringing its total purchases of these securities to up to $1.25 trillion this year, and to increase its purchases of [[agency debt]] this year by up to $100 billion to a total of up to $200 billion.  Moreover, to help improve conditions in private credit markets, the Committee decided to purchase up to $300 billion of longer-term Treasury securities during 2009.<ref>[http://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/press/monetary/20090318a.htm]</ref>

According to [[Ben Bernanke]], expansion of the Fed balance sheet means the Fed is electronically creating money, necessary "...because our economy is very weak and inflation is very low. When the economy begins to recover, that will be the time that we need to unwind those programs, raise interest rates, reduce the money supply, and make sure that we have a recovery that does not involve inflation."<ref>[http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2009/03/12/60minutes/main4862191.shtml Bernanke-60 Minutes Interview]</ref>

On 13 February 2008, [[George W.

However, this rebate coincided with an unexpected [[Oil price increases since 2003|jump in gasoline]] and food prices. This coincidence led some to wonder whether the stimulus package would have the intended effect, or whether consumers would simply spend their rebates to cover higher food and fuel prices.

On 17 February 2009, U.S. President [[Barack Obama]] signed the [[American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009]], an $787 billion stimulus package with a broad spectrum of spending and tax cuts.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/7889897.stm |title=BBC - Stimulus Package 2009 |publisher=BBC News |date=2009-02-14 |accessdate=2009-02-27}}</ref> Over $75 billion of which was specifically allocated to programs which help struggling homeowners.

{{Main|Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008}}
[[File:Bank Common Equity to Assets Ratios 2004 - 2008.png|thumb|Common Equity to Total Assets Ratios for Major USA Banks]]
Losses on mortgage-backed securities and other assets purchased with borrowed money have dramatically reduced the capital base of financial institutions, rendering many either insolvent or less capable of lending. Governments have provided funds to banks. Some banks have taken significant steps to acquire additional capital from private sources.

The U.S. government passed the [[Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008]] (EESA or TARP) during October 2008. This law included $700 billion in funding for the "[[Troubled Assets Relief Program]]" (TARP), which was used to lend funds to banks in exchange for dividend-paying preferred stock.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ustreas.gov/press/releases/hp1149.htm|title=Treasury - Paulson News Release}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/21/business/21cong.html?hp|title=Administration Is Seeking $700 Billion for Wall Street|publisher=New York Times | first=David M. | last=Herszenhorn | date=2008-09-21 | accessdate=2010-05-24}}</ref>

Another method of recapitalizing banks is for government and private investors to provide cash in exchange for mortgage-related assets (i.e., "toxic" or "legacy" assets), improving the quality of bank capital while reducing uncertainty regarding the financial position of banks. U.S. Treasury Secretary [[Timothy Geithner]] announced a plan during March 2009 to purchase "legacy" or "toxic" assets from banks. The [[Public-Private Partnership Investment Program]] involves government loans and guarantees to encourage private investors to provide funds to purchase toxic assets from banks.<ref>[http://www.ustreas.gov/press/releases/tg65.htm Press Release - Public-Private Investment Program]</ref>

===Bailouts and failures of financial firms===
{{See|List of bankrupt or acquired banks during the financial crisis of 2007<U+2013>2008|Federal takeover of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac|Government intervention during the subprime mortgage crisis|Bailout}}
[[Image:Birmingham Northern Rock bank run 2007.jpg|thumb|right|People queuing outside a [[Northern Rock]] bank branch in [[Birmingham]], [[United Kingdom]] on September 15, 2007, to [[bank run|withdraw their savings]] because of the subprime crisis.]]

Several major financial institutions either failed, were bailed-out by governments, or merged (voluntarily or otherwise) during the crisis. While the specific circumstances varied, in general the decline in the value of [[mortgage-backed securities]] held by these companies resulted in either their [[insolvency]], the equivalent of [[bank runs]] as investors pulled funds from them, or inability to secure new funding in the credit markets. These firms had typically borrowed and invested large sums of money relative to their cash or equity capital, meaning they were highly [[financial leverage|leveraged]] and vulnerable to unanticipated credit market disruptions.<ref>[http://www.newleftreview.org/?view=2715 Blackburn-New Left Review-Subprime Crisis]</ref>

The five largest U.S. investment banks, with combined liabilities or debts of $4 trillion, either went bankrupt ([[Lehman Brothers]]), were taken over by other companies ([[Bear Stearns]] and [[Merrill Lynch]]), or were bailed-out by the U.S. government ([[Goldman Sachs]] and [[Morgan Stanley]]) during 2008.<ref>[http://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/03/business/03sec.html NYT-Agency's 04 rule let banks pile up debt]</ref> Government-sponsored enterprises (GSE) [[Fannie Mae]] and [[Freddie Mac]] either directly owed or guaranteed nearly $5 trillion in mortgage obligations, with a similarly weak capital base, when they were placed into [[receivership]] in September 2008.<ref>[http://www.ofheo.gov/newsroom.aspx?ID=456&q1=0&q2=0 OFHEO-Statement of Director Lockhart]</ref> For scale, this $9 trillion in obligations concentrated in seven highly leveraged institutions can be compared to the $14 trillion size of the U.S. economy ([[GDP]])<ref>[http://www.bea.gov/national/index.htm#gdp BEA - U.S. GDP]</ref> or to the total national debt of $10 trillion in September 2008.<ref>[http://www.treasurydirect.gov/govt/reports/pd/histdebt/histdebt_histo5.htm Treasury Direct-Historical Debt Amounts]</ref>

Major depository banks around the world had also used [[financial innovation]]s such as [[structured investment vehicles]] to circumvent capital ratio regulations.<ref name="ft.com">[http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/3b94938c-1d59-11de-9eb3-00144feabdc0.html Dinallo-We Modernized Ourselves Into This Ice Age]</ref> Notable global failures included [[Northern Rock]], which was nationalized at an estimated cost of <U+00A3>87 billion ($150 billion).<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/comment/3161595/Financial-Crisis-Someone-will-have-to-dig-us-out-of-all-this-debt.html |title=Financial Crisis: Someone will have to dig us out of all this debt|publisher=Daily Telegraph|author=Robert Chote|accessdate=2008-10-19 | location=London | date=2008-10-08}}</ref> In the U.S., [[Washington Mutual]] (WaMu) was seized in September 2008 by the USA [[Office of Thrift Supervision]] (OTS).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601087&sid=a_WW5ZH_P_A0&refer=home |title=Bloomberg.com: Worldwide |publisher=Bloomberg.com |date= |accessdate=2008-10-06}}</ref> Dozens of U.S. banks received funds as part of the TARP or $700 billion bailout.<ref>[http://www.treas.gov/press/releases/hp1265.htm Paulson Update on TARP]</ref>

As a result of the financial crisis in 2008, twenty five U.S. banks became insolvent and were taken over by the FDIC.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.fdic.gov/bank/individual/failed/banklist.html |title=Failed Bank List | author=FDIC | accessdate=2009-06-27 }}</ref>  As of August 14, 2009, an additional 77 banks became insolvent.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.fdic.gov/news/news/press/2009/index.html |title=FDIC: Press Releases  | author=FDIC | accessdate=2009-07-31 }}</ref>  This seven month tally surpasses the 50 banks that were seized in all of 1993, but is still much smaller than the number of failed banking institutions in 1992, 1991, and 1990.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.fdic.gov/bank/statistical/stats/2009mar/fdic.pdf |title=FDIC Trends, March, 2009  | author=FDIC | accessdate=2009-07-10 }}</ref>  The United States has lost over 6 million jobs since the recession began in December 2007.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601110&sid=aCbHA.m7rikc |title=Five Banks are Seized | author=Margaret Chadbourn | accessdate=2009-06-27 }}</ref>

According to some, the bailouts could be traced directly to Alan Greenspan's efforts to reflate the stock market and the economy after the tech stock bust, and specifically to a February 23, 2004 speech Mr. Greenspan made to the Mortgage Bankers Association where he suggested that the time had come to push average American borrowers into more exotic loans with variable rates, or deferred interest.<ref name="Sean Olender">{{cite news | url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2007/03/20/EDG79ONVUI1.DTL |title=The Coming Mortgage Bailout | author=Sean Olender | accessdate=2007-03-20 | work=The San Francisco Chronicle | date=2007-03-20}}</ref> This argument suggests that Mr. Greenspan sought to enlist banks to expand lending and debt to stimulate asset prices and that the Federal Reserve and US Treasury Department would back any losses that might result. As early as March 2007 some commentators predicted that a bailout of the banks would exceed $1 trillion, at a time when Ben Bernanke, Alan Greenspan and Henry Paulson all claimed that mortgage problems were "contained" to the subprime market and no bailout of the financial sector would be necessary.<ref name="Sean Olender"/>

===Homeowner assistance===
Both lenders and borrowers may benefit from avoiding foreclosure, which is a costly and lengthy process. Some lenders have offered troubled borrowers more favorable mortgage terms (i.e., refinancing, loan modification or [[loss mitigation]]). Borrowers have also been encouraged to contact their lenders to discuss alternatives.<ref>{{cite news | title = Criticism rains down on mortgage industry - USATODAY.com | url=http://www.usatoday.com/money/economy/housing/2007-10-23-mortgages-refinance_N.htm | accessdate=2008-05-19 | year = 2008 | work=USA Today | first1=Noelle | last1=Knox | first2=Sue | last2=Kirchhoff | date=2007-10-23}}</ref>

[[The Economist]] described the issue this way: "No part of the financial crisis has received so much attention, with so little to show for it, as the tidal wave of home foreclosures sweeping over America. Government programmes have been ineffectual, and private efforts not much better." Up to 9 million homes may enter foreclosure over the 2009-2011 period, versus one million in a typical year.<ref>[http://www.economist.com/world/unitedstates/displaystory.cfm?story_id=13145396 Economist - Can't Pay or Won't Pay?]</ref> At roughly U.S. $50,000 per foreclosure according to a 2006 study by the Chicago Federal Reserve Bank, 9 million foreclosures represents $450 billion in losses.<ref>[http://topics.nytimes.com/topics/reference/timestopics/subjects/f/foreclosures/index.html NYT-Times Topics-Foreclosures]</ref>

A variety of voluntary private and government-administered or supported programs were implemented during 2007-2009 to assist homeowners with case-by-case mortgage assistance, to mitigate the foreclosure crisis engulfing the U.S. One example is the [[Hope Now Alliance]], an ongoing collaborative effort between the US Government and private industry to help certain subprime borrowers.<ref>[http://www.fsround.org/media/pdfs/AllianceRelease.pdf]</ref> In February 2008, the Alliance reported that during the second half of 2007, it had helped 545,000 subprime borrowers with shaky credit, or 7.7% of 7.1 million subprime loans outstanding as of September 2007. A spokesperson for the Alliance acknowledged that much more must be done.<ref>{{cite news | title = Hope Now says nearly 8% of subprime borrowers helped - Feb. 6, 2008 | url=http://money.cnn.com/2008/02/06/news/economy/loan_modification.ap/index.htm?source=yahoo_quote | accessdate=2008-05-19 | year = 2008 | work=CNN}}</ref>

During late 2008, major banks and both Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac established moratoriums (delays) on foreclosures, to give homeowners time to work towards refinancing.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://money.cnn.com/2008/10/06/real_estate/Drastic_plan_slashes_mortgage_costs/index.htm?source=yahoo_quote |title=BofA to slash mortgage payments for Countrywide borrowers - Oct. 6, 2008 |publisher=Money.cnn.com |date= 2008-10-06|accessdate=2008-10-24 | first1=Les | last1=Christie}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|author=By Les Christie, CNNMoney.com staff writer |url=http://money.cnn.com/2008/11/20/real_estate/Fannie_suspends_foreclosures/index.htm?postversion=2008112018 |title=CNN - Fannie & Freddie Suspend Foreclosures |publisher=Money.cnn.com |date=2008-11-20 |accessdate=2009-02-27}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=UW |url=http://www.fanniemae.com/newsreleases/2008/4531.jhtml;jsessionid=RGJIT1PN5WB5NJ2FQSISFGQ?p=Media&s=News+Releases |title=Fannie News Release |publisher=Fanniemae.com |date= |accessdate=2009-02-27}}</ref>

Critics have argued that the case-by-case [[loan modification]] method is ineffective, with too few homeowners assisted relative to the number of foreclosures and with nearly 40% of those assisted homeowners again becoming delinquent within 8 months.<ref name="printerfriendly1">{{cite news|url=http://www.economist.com/world/unitedstates/PrinterFriendly.cfm?story_id=13145239 |title=Economist-Understanding Foreclosure Drivers |publisher=Economist.com |date=2009-02-19 |accessdate=2009-02-27}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://banking.senate.gov/public/_files/HousingandEconomicRecoveryActSummary.pdf|title=Summary of Act|format=PDF}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | first = Les | last = Christie | title=No help for 70% of subprime borrowers | work = [[CNNMoney.com]] | publisher=[[Cable News Network]] | url=http://money.cnn.com/2008/04/22/real_estate/no_help_for_most_borrowers/index.htm?cnn=yes | date = 2008-04-22 | accessdate = 2008-09-17 }}</ref> In December 2008, the U.S. FDIC reported that more than half of mortgages modified during the first half of 2008 were delinquent again, in many cases because payments were not reduced or mortgage debt was not forgiven.  This is further evidence that case-by-case loan modification is not effective as a policy tool.<ref>{{cite news|author=By Les Christie, CNNMoney.com staff writer |url=http://money.cnn.com/2008/12/23/real_estate/new_modifications_same_problems/index.htm?cnn=yes |title=Most mortgage fixes are bad medicine - Dec. 23, 2008 |publisher=Money.cnn.com |date=2008-12-23 |accessdate=2009-02-27}}</ref>

In February 2009, economists [[Nouriel Roubini]] and [[Mark Zandi]] recommended an "across the board" (systemic) reduction of mortgage principal balances by as much as 20-30%. Lowering the mortgage balance would help lower monthly payments and also address an estimated 20 million homeowners that may have a financial incentive to enter voluntary foreclosure because they are "underwater" (i.e., the mortgage balance is larger than the home value).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.charlierose.com/view/interview/10090 |title=Charlie Rose-Roubini-Mortgage Solutions |publisher=Charlierose.com |date= |accessdate=2009-02-27}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.forbes.com/2009/02/18/depression-financial-crisis-capitalism-opinions-columnists_recession_stimulus.html |title=Forbes-Roubini |publisher=Forbes.com |date=2009-02-18 |accessdate=2009-02-27}}</ref>

A study by the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston indicated that banks were reluctant to modify loans. Only 3% of seriously delinquent homeowners had their mortgage payments reduced during 2008. In addition, investors who hold MBS and have a say in [[mortgage modification]]s have not been a significant impediment; the study found no difference in the rate of assistance whether the loans were controlled by the bank or by investors. Commenting on the study, economists [[Dean Baker]] and Paul Willen both advocated providing funds directly to homeowners instead of banks.<ref>[http://www.boston.com/business/articles/2009/07/07/lenders_avoid_redoing_loans_fed_concludes/ Boston Globe - Lenders Avoid Redoing Loans, Fed Concludes]</ref>

The ''[[L.A. Times]]'' reported the results of a study that found homeowners with high credit scores at the time of entering the mortgage are 50% more likely to "[[strategic default|strategically default]]" -- abruptly and intentionally pull the plug and abandon the mortgage<U+2014>compared with lower-scoring borrowers. Such strategic defaults were heavily concentrated in markets with the highest price declines. An estimated 588,000 strategic defaults occurred nationwide during 2008, more than double the total in 2007. They represented 18% of all serious delinquencies that extended for more than 60 days in the fourth quarter of 2008.<ref>[http://www.latimes.com/classified/realestate/news/la-fi-harney20-2009sep20,0,6741264,print.story LA Times-Homeowners who strategically default a growing problem-September 2009]</ref>

====Homeowners Affordability and Stability Plan====
{{Main|Homeowners Affordability and Stability Plan}}
On 18 February 2009, U.S. President Barack Obama announced a $73 billion program to help up to nine million homeowners avoid foreclosure, which was supplemented by $200 billion in additional funding for [[Fannie Mae]] and [[Freddie Mac]] to purchase and more easily refinance mortgages. The plan is funded mostly from the EESA's $700 billion financial bailout fund. It uses cost sharing and incentives to encourage lenders to reduce homeowner's monthly payments to 31 percent of their monthly income. Under the program, a lender would be responsible for reducing monthly payments to no more than 38 percent of a borrower<U+2019>s income, with government sharing the cost to further cut the rate to 31 percent. The plan also involves forgiving a portion of the borrower<U+2019>s mortgage balance. Companies that service mortgages will get incentives to modify loans and to help the homeowner stay current.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601087&sid=a7W_kzfPZbzw&refer=home%E2%80%8F |title=President Obama's Plan |publisher=Bloomberg.com |date=2009-02-20 |accessdate=2009-02-27}}</ref><ref>[http://www.treas.gov/initiatives/eesa/homeowner-affordability-plan/FactSheet.pdf Fact Sheet-Homeowners Affordability and Stability Plan]</ref><ref>[http://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/05/business/05housing.html?em NYT-U.S. Sets Big Incentives to Ward Off Foreclosures]</ref>

==Regulatory proposals and long-term solutions==
{{See|Subprime mortgage crisis solutions debate|Regulatory responses to the subprime crisis|}}

President [[Barack Obama]] and key advisers introduced a series of regulatory proposals in June 2009. The proposals address consumer protection, executive pay, bank financial cushions or capital requirements, expanded regulation of the [[shadow banking system]] and [[derivative (finance)|derivatives]], and enhanced authority for the [[Federal Reserve]] to safely wind-down systemically important institutions, among others.<ref>[http://www.whitehouse.gov/the_press_office/Remarks-of-the-President-on-Regulatory-Reform/]</ref><ref>[http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/06/14/AR2009061402443_pf.html Washington Post - Geithner & Summers - A New Financial Foundation]</ref><ref>[http://www.financialstability.gov/roadtostability/regulatoryreform.html Treasury Department Report - Financial Regulatory Reform]</ref>

A variety of regulatory changes have been proposed by economists, politicians, journalists, and business leaders to minimize the impact of the current crisis and prevent recurrence. However, as of June 2009, many of the proposed solutions have not yet been implemented. These include:

*[[Ben Bernanke]]: Establish resolution procedures for closing troubled financial institutions in the [[shadow banking system]], such as investment banks and hedge funds.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bernanke20081201a.htm |title=Bernanke Remarks |publisher=Federalreserve.gov |date=2008-12-01 |accessdate=2009-02-27}}</ref>

*[[Paul McCulley]] advocated "counter-cyclical regulatory policy to help modulate human nature." He cited the work of economist [[Hyman Minsky]], who believed that human behavior is pro-cyclical, meaning it amplifies the extent of booms and busts. In other words, humans are momentum investors rather than value investors. Counter-cyclical policies would include increasing capital requirements during boom periods and reducing them during busts.<ref>[http://media.pimco-global.com/pdfs/pdf/GCB%20Focus%20May%2009.pdf?WT.cg_n=PIMCO-US&WT.ti=GCB%20Focus%20May%2009.pdf McCulley PIMCO-The Shadow Banking System and Hyman Minsky's Journey-May 2009]</ref>

U.S. Treasury Secretary [[Timothy Geithner]] testified before Congress on October 29, 2009. His testimony included five elements he stated as critical to effective reform: 1) Expand the [[FDIC]] bank resolution mechanism to include [[shadow banking system|non-bank financial institutions]]; 2) Ensure that a firm is allowed to fail in an orderly way and not be "rescued"; 3) Ensure taxpayers are not on the hook for any losses, by applying losses to the firm's investors and creating a monetary pool funded by the largest financial institutions; 4) Apply appropriate checks and balances to the FDIC and Federal Reserve in this resolution process; 5) Require stronger capital and liquidity positions for financial firms and related regulatory authority.<ref>[http://www.ustreas.gov/press/releases/tg335.htm Secretary Geithner Testimony to House Financial Service Committee-October 29, 2009]</ref>

The U.S. Senate passed a regulatory reform bill in May 2010, following the House which passed a bill in December 2009. These bills must now be reconciled. The New York Times has provided a comparative summary of the features of the two bills, which address to varying extent the principles enumerated by Secretary Geithner.<ref>[http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2010/05/20/business/20100520-regulation-graphic.html New York Times-Major Parts of the Financial Regulation Overhaul-May 2010]</ref>

===Law investigations, judicial and other responses===
Significant law enforcement action and litigation is resulting from the crisis. The U.S. [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] was looking into the possibility of fraud by mortgage financing companies [[Fannie Mae]] and [[Freddie Mac]], [[Lehman Brothers]], and insurer [[American International Group]], among others.<ref>[http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,426783,00.html FBI Investigating Potential Fraud by Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, Lehman, AIG], [[Associated Press]], September 23, 2008.</ref> New York Attorney General Andrew Cuomo is suing Long Island based Amerimod, one of the nation's largest loan modification corporations for fraud, and has issued 14 subpoenas to other similar companies.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blogs.villagevoice.com/runninscared/archives/2009/06/cuomo_ill_sue_f.php |title=Cuomo: I'll Sue Foreclosure-Relief Scam Artists |publisher=villagevoice.com |date=2009-06-09 |accessdate=2009-06-09}}</ref> The FBI also assigned more agents to mortgage-related crimes and its caseload has dramatically increased.<ref name="CBS FBI Mortgage Cracks Down">{{cite news | title=FBI Cracks Down On Mortgage Fraud | date=2008-06-19 | publisher = [[CBS news]] | url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2008/06/19/national/main4194649.shtml}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fbi.gov/page2/june08/malicious_mortgage061908.html |title=FBI <U+2014> Mortgage Fraud Takedown - Press Room - Headline Archives 06-19-08 |publisher=Fbi.gov |date= |accessdate=2008-10-26}}</ref> The FBI began a probe of [[Countrywide]] in March 2008 for possible fraudulent lending practices and securities fraud.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://money.cnn.com/2008/03/08/news/companies/countrywide_FBI/?postversion=2008031003 |title=FBI probes Countrywide for possible fraud |publisher=Money.cnn.com |date= 2008-03-08|accessdate=2009-02-27}}</ref>

Over 300 civil lawsuits were filed in federal courts during 2007 related to the subprime crisis. The number of filings in state courts was not quantified but is also believed to be significant.<ref>{{cite news | title = Subprime lawsuits on pace to top S&amp;L cases - The Boston Globe | url=http://www.boston.com/business/articles/2008/02/15/subprime_lawsuits_on_pace_to_top_sl_cases/ | accessdate=2008-05-19 | date=2008-02-15}}</ref>

==Implications==

Estimates of impact have continued to climb.  During April 2008, [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF) estimated that global losses for financial institutions would approach $1 trillion.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.finfacts.com/irishfinancenews/article_1013133.shtml|title=IMF says worldwide losses stemming from the US subprime mortgage crisis could run to $945 billion}}</ref> One year later, the IMF estimated cumulative losses of banks and other financial institutions globally would exceed $4 trillion.<ref>[http://www.imf.org/External/Pubs/FT/GFSR/2009/01/pdf/summary.pdf IMF Summary]</ref> This is equal to U.S. $20,000 for each of 200,000,000 people.

[[Francis Fukuyama]] has argued that the crisis represents the end of [[Reaganism]] in the financial sector, which was characterized by lighter regulation, pared-back government, and lower taxes. Significant financial sector regulatory changes are expected as a result of the crisis.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newsweek.com/id/162401 |title=Fukuyama: The End of America Inc &#124; Newsweek Business &#124; Newsweek.com |publisher=Newsweek.com |date= |accessdate=2008-10-24}}</ref>

[[Fareed Zakaria]] believes that the crisis may force Americans and their government to live within their means. Further, some of the best minds may be redeployed from [[financial engineering]] to more valuable business activities, or to science and technology.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newsweek.com/id/163449/page/1 |title=Zakaria: A More Disciplined America &#124; Newsweek Business &#124; Newsweek.com |publisher=Newsweek.com |date= |accessdate=2008-10-24}}</ref>

[[Roger Altman]] wrote that "the crash of 2008 has inflicted profound damage on [the U.S.] financial system, its economy, and its standing in the world; the crisis is an important geopolitical setback...the crisis has coincided with historical forces that were already shifting the world's focus away from the United States. Over the medium term, the United States will have to operate from a smaller global platform -- while others, especially China, will have a chance to rise faster."<ref name="foreignaffairs1"/>

[[GE]] CEO [[Jeffrey Immelt]] has argued that U.S. trade deficits and budget deficits are unsustainable. America must regain its competitiveness through innovative products, training of production workers, and business leadership. He advocates specific national goals related to energy security or independence, specific technologies, expansion of the manufacturing job base, and net exporter status.<ref>[http://www.charlierose.com/view/interview/10412 Charlie Rose - Immelt Interview]</ref> "The world has been reset. Now we must lead an aggressive American renewal to win in the future." Of critical importance, he said, is the need to focus on technology and manufacturing. <U+201C>Many bought into the idea that America could go from a technology-based, export-oriented powerhouse to a services-led, consumption-based economy <U+2014> and somehow still expect to prosper,<U+201D> Jeff said. <U+201C>That idea was flat wrong.<U+201D><ref>[http://www.gereports.com/american-renewal-immelt-addresses-detroit-econ-club/ Immelt Comments at Detroit Econ Club]</ref>

Economist [[Paul Krugman]] wrote in 2009: "The prosperity of a few years ago, such as it was&mdash;profits were terrific, wages not so much<U+2014>depended on a huge bubble in housing, which replaced an earlier huge bubble in stocks. And since the housing bubble isn<U+2019>t coming back, the spending that sustained the economy in the pre-crisis years isn<U+2019>t coming back either."<ref>[http://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/22/opinion/22krugman.html Krugman-Life Without Bubbles]</ref> [[Niall Ferguson]] stated that excluding the effect of home equity extraction, the U.S. economy grew at a 1% rate during the Bush years.<ref>[http://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/RTGAM.20090223.wferguson0223/BNStory/crashandrecovery/home?pageRequested=all&print=true Ferguson - Interview]</ref> [[Microsoft]] CEO [[Steve Ballmer]] has argued that this is an economic reset at a lower level, rather than a recession, meaning that no quick recovery to pre-recession levels can be expected.<ref>[http://www.realclearmarkets.com/video/2009/06/30/ballmer_economy_has_reset.html Ballmer-Reset, Not Recession]</ref>

The U.S. Federal government's efforts to support the global financial system have resulted in significant new financial commitments, totaling $7 trillion by November, 2008. These commitments can be characterized as investments, loans, and loan guarantees, rather than direct expenditures. In many cases, the government purchased financial assets such as commercial paper, mortgage-backed securities, or other types of asset-backed paper, to enhance [[liquidity]] in frozen markets.<ref>{{cite news|author=By David Goldman, CNNMoney.com staff writer |url=http://money.cnn.com/2008/11/26/news/economy/where_bailout_stands/index.htm?postversion=2008112813 |title=CNN-Bailout Summary |publisher=Money.cnn.com |date= 2008-11-26|accessdate=2009-02-27}}</ref> As the crisis has progressed, the Fed has expanded the collateral against which it is willing to lend to include higher-risk assets.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601087&sid=akZVTnBs66uY&refer=home|title=Bloomberg Article}}</ref>

[[The Economist]] wrote in May 2009: "Having spent a fortune bailing out their banks, Western governments will have to pay a price in terms of higher taxes to meet the interest on that debt. In the case of countries (like Britain and America) that have trade as well as budget deficits, those higher taxes will be needed to meet the claims of foreign creditors. Given the political implications of such austerity, the temptation will be to default by stealth, by letting their currencies depreciate. Investors are increasingly alive to this danger..."<ref>[http://www.economist.com/finance/displayStory.cfm?story_id=13653915&source=hptextfeature Economist-A New Global System is Coming Into Existence]</ref>

[[Thomas Friedman]] wrote in May 2010 that technological and financial innovation have made us more globally interdependent, but that ethics and values have not kept up. He supported the ideas of author Dov Seidman, that "sustainable values" that reflect our interdependence should replace "situational values" that optimize outcomes for one at the expense of many others.<ref>[http://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/16/opinion/16friedman.html?ref=opinion NYT-Tom Friedman-A Letter from Lydia-May 2010]</ref>

The crisis has cast doubt on the legacy of [[Alan Greenspan]], the Chairman of the Federal Reserve System from 1986 to January 2006. Senator [[Chris Dodd]] claimed that Greenspan created the "[[perfect storm]]".<ref>{{cite web | title = FT.com / Companies / US &amp; Canada - Fed rapped over subprime loans | url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/66d98aea-d8e4-11db-a759-000b5df10621,Authorised=false.html?_i_location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ft.com%2Fcms%2Fs%2F66d98aea-d8e4-11db-a759-000b5df10621.html&_i_referer=http%3A%2F%2Fftalphaville.ft.com%2Fblog%2F2007%2F03%2F23%2F3374%2Ffed-targeted-in-political-backlash-over-subprime-loans%2F | accessdate=2008-05-19 | year = 2008 }}</ref> When asked to comment on the crisis, Greenspan spoke as follows:<ref name="WallStreetJournal" />

{{quote|The current credit crisis will come to an end when the overhang of inventories of newly built homes is largely liquidated, and home price deflation comes to an end. That will stabilize the now-uncertain value of the home equity that acts as a buffer for all home mortgages, but most importantly for those held as collateral for residential mortgage-backed securities. Very large losses will, no doubt, be taken as a consequence of the crisis. But after a period of protracted adjustment, the U.S. economy, and the world economy more generally, will be able to get back to business.}}
