'''About Adam''' is a [[2000]] Irish film, a [[romantic comedy]] about the relation between Adam ([[Stuart Townsend]]) and Lucy ([[Kate Hudson]]). It is very loosely based on ''[[Theorem (film)|Theorem]]'' by [[Pier Paolo Pasolini]].

Adam is a young [[Dublin]] serial seducer.  Not happy with falling for Lucy ([[Kate Hudson]]), he seduces her two sisters Laura ([[Frances O'Connor]]) and Alice ([[Charlotte Bradley]]) as well. The story throughout is shown from each member of the family's point of view, showing a differing mood for each scene.
