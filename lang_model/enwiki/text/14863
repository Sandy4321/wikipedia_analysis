'''KMOH-TV''' is a full-service [[television station]] in [[Kingman, Arizona]], providing over-the-air service to Kingman, [[Bullhead City, Arizona|Bullhead City]]/[[Laughlin, Nevada|Laughlin]], and surrounding [[Mohave County, Arizona|Mohave County]]. It broadcasts in [[NTSC|analog]] on [[Very high frequency|VHF]] channel 6 and in [[ATSC|digital]] on [[Ultra high frequency|UHF]] channel 19 from its transmitter on Black Mountain near [[Oatman, Arizona|Oatman]]. KMOH is an affiliate of [[MTV Tr3s]].

'''KEJR-LP''' is a low-power television station in [[Phoenix, Arizona]], rebroadcasting the signal of KMOH in [[NTSC|analog]] on [[Ultra high frequency|UHF]] channel 43 from its transmitter on South Mountain in Phoenix.

Both stations are owned by Bela Broadcasting of [[Miami, Florida]] and brand themselves using the KEJR call letters.

== History ==
KMOH-TV began with an original construction permit granted to Standard Life Insurance Company on [[April 8]], [[1985]], transmission specs unknown. A 1986 modification to the construction permit specified Black Mountain as the transmitter location with 100 kW effective radiated power. Standard Life Insurance Company licensed the station on [[June 1]], [[1998]], then transferred control of it to Grand Canyon Television Company in December.

In the late 1980s and early 1990s, KMOH was an English-language, independent television station, with its own local newscast. It was listed as an [[American Independent Network]] (AIN) affiliate in July 1996 [http://www.wjmktv.com/acr/ACRdemographics.pdf] and has also been listed as a [[Network One]] (N1) affiliate, date unknown [http://web.archive.org/web/19971008055026/www.n1.com/affiliate.htm]. In late 1996, it became an affiliate of [[The WB Television Network]], then in May 1997, the [[Gannett Company]] bought the station from Grand Canyon Television Company and changed it to a [[rebroadcaster|satellite station]] of [[NBC]] affiliate [[KPNX]] channel 12 of [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]].

[[Image:Kejr_logo.gif|frame|left|The former KEJR/KMOH logo, used until the change of affiliation to MTV Tr3s.]]
In August, 2004, Bela Broadcasting, looking to expand the reach of their family-oriented Spanish-language format, acquired KMOH from Gannett, making the station a Spanish-language Independent, airing mostly the same content as [[KBEH]] of [[Oxnard, California]], but not on the same schedule. From Kingman, they hoped to put signals into the Phoenix and [[Las Vegas, Nevada|Las Vegas]] markets [http://www.lvbusinesspress.com/articles/2004/12/30/news/news04.txt], both with large Hispanic populations, and while it cannot be verified as a reason for buying KMOH, a full-service station in the Phoenix [[media market]], it is clear that Bela Broadcasting desired [[must-carry]] cable coverage in Phoenix as well. With KMOH no longer a rebroadcaster of KPNX, [[Cox Enterprises|Cox Communications]] petitioned the [[Federal Communications Commission|FCC]] to allow it to exclude the station from must-carry provisions in its 16 Phoenix-area communities, since, while it is part of the Phoenix market, it is 165 miles away and did not put a signal into Phoenix. KMOH fought the exclusion, but lost, in large part due to their lack of local programming directed at Phoenix, and also in part due to not having any signal in Phoenix [http://hraunfoss.fcc.gov/edocs_public/attachmatch/DA-05-2248A1.pdf]. In November 2005 Bela Broadcasting acquired KQBN-LP (now KEJR-LP) channel 43 from [[Una Vez Mas]], and made it a translator station of KMOH-TV, giving the station a signal in Phoenix. As Phoenix is the much larger market, however, both stations are branded as KEJR 43 Phoenix instead of the reverse.

On [[November 27]], [[2006]], Bela dropped the Spanish independent format from all of their stations and made them affiliates of  MTV Tr3s.

=== KEJR-LP history pre-2005 ===
'''KEJR-LP''' had its own history prior to being acquired by Bela Broadcasting in 2005. It began with an original construction permit for '''K31DI''' UHF channel 31, granted to Raul Infante, Jr. on [[June 5]], [[1992]], and licensed on [[August 22]], [[1995]]. The original transmitter site was in [[Sun City, Arizona|Sun City]].  Early programming is unknown.

In June 1998, Infante sold the station to Hispanic Television of Phoenix, who in turn sold it to Television Apogeo de Phoenix in October.  In 1999, the [[Federal Communications Commission|FCC]] granted full-service station [[KSAZ-TV]] permission to build their digital television station on channel 31, and K31DI was forced to move to another channel. Television Apogeo took the station silent in March 2000, but returned to air in October, when they were granted Special Temporary Authority to operate on channel 43. Television Apogeo licensed the station on channel 43 with new call letters '''K43GV''' in December 2001. By this time, it was simulcasting [[Telemundo]] programming from '''KDRX-CA''' (now [[KDTP-CA]]).

[[Una Vez Mas]] acquired the station in January 2004 and applied to move the transmitter location from Sun City to South Mountain in Phoenix. The permit was granted and the new facilities were licensed in October 2005. Meanwhile, they resurrected a set of call letters they had used in Tucson, and renamed the station '''KQBN-LP''' in March 2005. They also replaced the Telemundo programming with Spanish-language [[Christianity|Christian]] network [[Almavision]].

Even before the station was licensed at its new South Mountain transmitter site, Una Vez Mas sold the station to Bela Broadcasting, with the transaction finalized in November, 2005. Upon taking ownership, Bela again changed the call letters, this time to '''KEJR-LP''', and made the station a translator for KMOH-TV.

==Programming==
KMOH and KEJR air the entire MTV Tr3s schedule, except for one hour on Sunday afternoons, where they retained the local public affairs show, ''El 6 Para Ti'.
