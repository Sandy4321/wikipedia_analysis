'''Ernst Friedrich Christoph "Fritz" Sauckel''' (27 October 1894 <U+2013> 16 October 1946) was a Nazi [[war criminal]], who organized the systematic [[slavery|enslavement]] of millions from lands occupied by [[Nazi Germany]].  He was General Plenipotentiary for Labour Deployment from 1942 until the end of the war, after which he was tried and executed.

==Early life==
He was born in [[Ha<U+00DF>furt]] ([[Kingdom of Bavaria]]), the only child of a postman and a seamstress. Sauckel was educated at local schools and left early when his mother fell ill. He joined the [[merchant marine]] of [[Norway]] and [[Sweden]] at age fifteen, first on a Norwegian three-masted [[schooner]], and later on Swedish and German vessels. He went on to sail throughout the world, rising to the rank of ''Vollmatrose''. At the outbreak of [[World War I]], he was on a German vessel en route to [[Australia]] when the vessel was captured. He was subsequently [[internment|interned]] in France from August 1914 until November 1919.

He returned to Germany, found factory work in [[Schweinfurt]], and studied engineering in [[Ilmenau]] from 1922 to 1923. He joined the [[National Socialist German Workers Party]] (NSDAP) in 1923 (member 1,395). In 1924 he married Elisabeth Wetzel, with whom he had ten children. He remained a party member over its dissolution and publicly rejoined in 1925. Sauckel was appointed party [[Gauleiter]] of [[Th<U+00FC>ringia]] in 1927 and became a member of the regional government in 1929. Following the Nazi seizure of power in 1933, he was promoted to Reich Regent of Th<U+00FC>ringia and [[Reichstag (institution)|Reichstag]] member. He was also given an honorary rank of [[Obergruppenf<U+00FC>hrer]] in the [[Sturmabteilung|SA]] and the [[SS]] in 1934.

==World War II==
During [[World War II]] he was Reich defence commissioner for the [[Kassel]] district (''Reichsverteidigungskommissar Wehrkreis IX'') before being appointed General Plenipotentiary for Labour Deployment (''Generalbevollm<U+00E4>chtigter f<U+00FC>r den Arbeitseinsatz'') on 21 March 1942, on the recommendation of [[Martin Bormann]]. He worked directly under Hitler through the Four-Year Plan Office, directing and controlling German labour. In response to increased demands, he met the requirement for manpower with people from the occupied territories.  Voluntary numbers were insufficient and forced recruitment was introduced within a few months. Of the 5 million workers brought to Germany, around 200,000 came voluntarily. The majority of the acquired workers originated from the Eastern territories, where the methods used to gain workers were reportedly very harsh.

==Trial and execution==
[[Image:Dead fritzsauckel.jpg|thumb|left|The body of Fritz Sauckel after execution, October 16, 1946]]
He was a defendant at the [[Nuremberg trials]] accused of conspiracy to commit crimes against peace; planning, initiating and waging wars of aggression; war crimes and crimes against humanity. He defended the ''[[Arbeitseinsatz]]'' as "nothing to do with exploitation. It is an economic process for supplying labour". He denied that it was slave labour or that it was common to deliberately work people to death (extermination by labour) or to mistreat them.

He was found guilty of war crimes and crimes against humanity, and together with a number of colleagues, he was hanged on 16 October 1946. His last words were recorded as "Ich sterbe unschuldig, mein Urteil ist ungerecht. Gott besch<U+00FC>tze Deutschland!" (''I die innocent, my sentence is unjust. God protect Germany!'').

Fritz Sauckel's sentence has been much the contentious subject among historians. Sauckel's ministerial responsibilities were part of Goering's "Four Year Plan" the so-called economic solution for greater Germany. The common misconception is that Albert Speer was his direct superior on account of his demands to meet the quota of foreign labourers in his munitions divisions. This assertion is incorrect, as Goering was effectively his direct superior. It is true that Speer inherited vital economic responsibility from Goering with his assumption as minister of armaments, but the policy of acquiring foreign labour was enabled by then armaments minister Fritz Todt and Hermann Goering. Moreover, the mistreatment of dragooned prisoners was ultimately left up to the discretion of the respective commandant of the division, not Sauckel. He expressly stated in a memorandum to his delegates of foreign labour that the men and women be treated accordingly with adequate care. In this sense the mistreatment of foreign labourers falls neither, on Sauckel, or on Speer for that matter.
