'''State Route 56''' ('''SR&nbsp;56''') is an east<U+2013>west [[State highways in California|state highway]] in the U.S. state of [[California]]. It runs {{convert|9.210|mi|km}} from [[Interstate 5 in California|Interstate&nbsp;5]] (I-5) in the [[Carmel Valley, San Diego, California|Carmel Valley]] neighborhood of [[San Diego]] to [[Interstate 15 in California|I-15]]. The eastern terminus of the highway is also the western end of the Ted Williams Parkway. SR&nbsp;56 serves as an important connector between I-5 and I-15, being the only east<U+2013>west freeway between [[California State Route 78|SR&nbsp;78]] in [[North County, San Diego|north San Diego County]], several miles away, and [[California State Route 52|SR&nbsp;52]] near [[Marine Corps Air Station Miramar]]. It is also named the '''Ted Williams Freeway''', after the San Diego-born [[Ted Williams|baseball player]].

SR&nbsp;56 was added to the state highway system in 1959 as Legislative Route&nbsp;278, and was renumbered SR&nbsp;56 in the [[1964 state highway renumbering (California)|1964 state highway renumbering]]. Plans in 1964 were to connect SR&nbsp;56 to the north end of [[California State Route 125|SR&nbsp;125]] and continue east to [[California State Route 67|SR&nbsp;67]], but these plans did not come to fruition. The eastern end from Black Mountain Road to I-15 was completed in 1993; the western end from I-5 to Carmel Creek Road was completed in 1995 after several lawsuits filed by the [[Sierra Club]] and other community groups. The two ends were not connected until the middle portion of the freeway was completed in 2004. The delay was largely due to funding issues and environmental concerns.

==Route description==
[[File:SR 56 west.JPG|thumb|left|SR 56 west at the Carmel Creek Road interchange]]
Eastbound SR&nbsp;56 begins as a ramp from the northbound [[Interstate 5|I-5]]'s local bypass lanes. The interchange is not complete; southbound I-5 traffic must exit to Carmel Valley Road before entering SR&nbsp;56. Westbound traffic on SR&nbsp;56 merges into the southbound I-5 local bypass lanes, which provide access to I-805. Continuing east, the route then has a [[diamond interchange]] at Carmel Creek Road, which provides access to the nearby [[San Diego Jewish Academy]], and proceeds eastward through a residential area. After passing milepost 2, the freeway has another diamond interchange with Carmel Country Road south of the community of [[Torrey Hills, San Diego|Torrey Hills]].<ref name="bing" />

SR&nbsp;56 meets Carmel Valley Road and curves northward, passing [[Canyon Crest Academy]] before turning southeastward. The route passes over McGonigle Creek before intersecting Camino Del Sur, which serves the nearby [[Westview High School (San Diego)|Westview High School]]. Southeast of Camino Del Sur, SR&nbsp;56 curves back east, passing under Carmel Mountain Road without an exit. The route encounters exits with Black Mountain Road and Rancho Pe<U+00F1>asquitos Boulevard in [[Rancho Pe<U+00F1>asquitos, San Diego|Rancho Pe<U+00F1>asquitos]] in a primarily residential area before meeting its terminus at a diamond interchange with [[Interstate 15|I-15]]. Past the bridge over I-15, the road continues as Ted Williams Parkway.<ref name="bing">{{bing maps|url=http://www.bing.com/maps/#JmNwPXBncmQ4ejU3Mmd3OSZsdmw9MTImZGlyPTAmc3R5PWImcnRwPXBvcy4zMi45MzQwODM1OTQ2Njk4OV8tMTE3LjIzODMzMTIyMjkzNTkzX25lYXIlMjBDYXJtZWwlMjBWYWxsZXklMjBSZCUyQyUyMFNhbiUyMERpZWdvJTJDJTIwQ0ElMjA5MjEzMF9fX2FffnBvcy4zMi45NjQ3MTE5OTE2ODcxNF8tMTE3LjA5NTExMTk5MDM3Njc4X19fX2FfJm1vZGU9RCZydG9wPTB+MH4wfg==|title=SR&nbsp;56|accessdate=February 7, 2011|link=no}}</ref>

==History==

===Planning and initial construction===
Planning for SR&nbsp;56 started in 1956, according to San Diego Councilwoman Barbara Warden.<ref name="plan2" /> The route was first added to the California State Highway System in 1959 as Legislative Route Number 278 (LRN&nbsp;278). The routing ran from [[Legislative Route 2 (California pre-1964)|LRN&nbsp;2]], which later became [[US 101 (CA)|US&nbsp;101]], all the way east to [[Legislative Route 198 (California pre-1964)|LRN&nbsp;198]], which is now SR&nbsp;67.<ref>{{cite CAstat|year=1959|ch=1062}}</ref> In the [[1964 state highway renumbering (California)|1964 state highway renumbering]], LRN&nbsp;278 was renumbered SR&nbsp;56 and was designated to run from I-5 to [[SR 67 (CA)|SR&nbsp;67]].<ref>{{cite CAstat|year=1963|ch=385}}</ref> On December&nbsp;30, 1980, the City of [[Poway, California|Poway]] included SR&nbsp;56 in their city plan extending all the way east through the city to a northern extension of [[SR 125 (CA)|SR 125]].<ref>{{cite news | title=Poway Council Includes Route&nbsp;56 in General Plan | work=The San Diego Union | date=December 31, 1980 | last= Taylor |first= Rivian | page=3 | oclc=13155544}}</ref> In 1983, both the cities of San Diego and Poway supported the extension of SR&nbsp;56 all the way to SR&nbsp;67, although Poway wanted the route moved and had reservations about the freeway ending in their city.<ref>{{cite news | title=San Diego, Poway Back Proposed Freeway | work=The San Diego Union | date=January 20, 1983 | last= Pimentel |first= Ricardo | page=B3| oclc=13155544}}</ref> Nevertheless, {{as of|2012|lc=yes}} there are no plans to construct the portion of SR&nbsp;56 east of I-15;<ref name="TCR">{{cite web | author=Staff|url=http://www.dot.ca.gov/dist11/departments/planning/pdfs/tcs/08_SR_56TCS.pdf | title=State-Route&nbsp;56 Transportation Concept Summary | publisher=Caltrans | date=May 2008 | accessdate=October 6, 2012 | format=PDF|pages=1<U+2013>2}}</ref> several arterial roads connect the eastern end of the SR 56 freeway with SR 67, including Ted Williams Parkway, Twin Peaks Road, Espola Road ([[CR S5 (CA)|CR S5]]), and Poway Road ([[CR S4 (CA)|CR S4]]).<ref name="bing" />

Citizens began to lobby for the construction of SR&nbsp;56 in 1986, in a similar action to efforts for [[SR 52 (CA)|SR 52]].<ref>{{cite news | title=Drive to build State Route 56 gets under way | work=Evening Tribune | date=April 19, 1986 | last= Balint |first= Kathryn | location=San Diego| page=C9 | oclc=37687666}}</ref> As far back as 1987, the [[Sierra Club]] opposed the use of sales tax revenue to build the freeway because of environmental concerns.<ref>{{cite news | title=Groups fear growth, oppose sales tax use to build Route&nbsp;56 | work=Evening Tribune | date=April 3, 1987 | last=Krueger |first= Anne | location=San Diego | page=B6| oclc=37687666}}</ref> A public forum was held on April&nbsp;10, 1990, in Rancho Pe<U+00F1>asquitos.

Opposition to the western segment (from I-5 to Carmel Valley Road) persisted.

The construction of a "dual freeway" at the western end was scheduled to begin in early 2002, referring to the two [[carriageways]] needed for each direction of the freeway. It would require drivers to use the new local lanes to access eastbound SR&nbsp;56 from I-5 or [[I-805 (CA)|I-805]]. The project would allow for trucks to use the new lanes to assist in merging with traffic.<ref>{{cite news | title=Battling the bottleneck State has big plans for I-5, starting with work to ease jams at infamous 'merge' | work=The San Diego Union-Tribune | date=June 25, 2001 | last=Thornton | first=Kelly | page=A1| oclc=25257675}}</ref> The northbound lanes were scheduled to open in February&nbsp;2006.<ref>{{cite news | title=Showers push back opening of bypass | work=The San Diego Union-Tribune | date=February 19, 2006 | author=Staff | page=B3| oclc=25257675}}</ref> The southbound I-15 to westbound SR&nbsp;56 ramp was improved in a construction project in 2005.<ref>{{cite news | title=Caltrans: Freeway work to be done by spring | work=The San Diego Union-Tribune | date=February 4, 2005 | last=Ristine | first=Jeff | page=B2| oclc=25257675}}</ref>

Concerns about the lack of a ramp from westbound SR&nbsp;56 to northbound I-5 date back from 1988, because of a projected increase of traffic on local Carmel Valley streets.<ref>{{cite news | title=CalTrans to take 2nd look at north ramp | work=The San Diego Union | date=May 14, 1988 | last=Kaufman | first=Laura | page=B3| oclc=25257675}}</ref> Planning for the missing ramps at the western end of SR&nbsp;56 was under way in 2008, despite nearby homeowner opposition.<ref>{{cite news | title=Making Connections: Caltrans tries to allay fears about Route&nbsp;56 ramp options, but residents wary | work=The San Diego Union-Tribune | date=June 5, 2008 | last=Burge | first=Michael | page=CZ1| oclc=25257675}}</ref> Caltrans agreed not to destroy homes in late June&nbsp;2008, but concerns about noise and funding remained.<ref>{{cite news | title=Revised ramp plan spares houses 3 options in play for I-5/Route&nbsp;56 project | work=The San Diego Union-Tribune | date=June 29, 2008 | last=Burge | first=Michael | page=N1| oclc=25257675}}</ref> On June&nbsp;13, 2012, Caltrans held a public forum to discuss five proposals to address the missing ramps at the western terminus:
*build the westbound to northbound ramp and the southbound to eastbound ramp,
*add additional lanes to both SR&nbsp;56 and I-5,
*only build the westbound-to-northbound ramp and add lanes to southbound I-5 and eastbound SR&nbsp;56,
*build the westbound-to-northbound ramp and add lanes on SR&nbsp;56 only, or
