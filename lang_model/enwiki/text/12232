'''Ravi Shankar''' ({{lang-bn|<U+09B0><U+09AC><U+09BF> <U+09B6><U+0982><U+0995><U+09B0>}}; born 7 April 1920), often referred to by the title [[Pandit]], is an [[India]]n [[sitar|sitarist]] and composer. He has been described as the most well known contemporary Indian musician by ''[[Musik in Geschichte und Gegenwart]]''.<ref name="Neuhoff">{{cite encyclopedia |last=Neuhoff |first=Hans |editor=Finscher, Ludwig |encyclopedia=[[Musik in Geschichte und Gegenwart|Die Musik in Geschichte und Gegenwart: allgemeine Enzyklop<U+00E4>die der Musik]] |title=Shankar, Ravi |language=German |edition=2nd |year=2006 |publisher=[[B<U+00E4>renreiter]] |volume=15 |isbn=3761811225 |pages=672<U+2013>673}}</ref>

Shankar was born in [[Varanasi]] and spent his youth touring Europe and India with the dance group of his brother [[Uday Shankar]]. He gave up dancing in 1938 to study sitar playing under court musician [[Allauddin Khan]]. After finishing his studies in 1944, Shankar worked as a composer, creating the music for the ''[[The Apu Trilogy|Apu Trilogy]]'' by [[Satyajit Ray]], and was music director of [[All India Radio]], [[New Delhi]], from 1949 to 1956.

In 1956, he began to tour Europe and America playing Indian classical music and increased its popularity there in the 1960s through teaching, performance, and his association with violinist [[Yehudi Menuhin]] and [[George Harrison]] of [[The Beatles]]. Shankar engaged Western music by writing concerti for sitar and orchestra and toured the world in the 1970s and 1980s. From 1986 to 1992 he served as a nominated member of the upper chamber of the [[Parliament of India]]. Shankar was awarded India's highest civilian honor, the [[Bharat Ratna]], in 1999, and received three [[Grammy Award]]s. He continues to perform in the 2000s, often with his daughter [[Anoushka Shankar|Anoushka]].

==Style and contributions==
[[File:Dia5275 Ravi Shankar.jpg|thumb|alt=A man sits cross-legged and holds a long-necked lute while looking to the side.|Shankar in 1988]]
Shankar developed a style distinct from that of his contemporaries and incorporated influences from rhythm practices of [[Carnatic music]].<ref name="NewGrove" /> His performances begin with solo ''[[alap]]'', ''[[jor]]'', and ''[[jhala]]'' (introduction and performances with pulse and rapid pulse) influenced by the slow and serious ''[[dhrupad]]'' genre, followed by a section with [[tabla]] accompaniment featuring compositions associated with the prevalent ''[[khyal]]'' style.<ref name="NewGrove" /> Shankar often closes his performances with a piece inspired by the light-classical ''[[thumri]]'' genre.<ref name="NewGrove" />

Shankar has been considered one of the top sitarists of the second half of the 20th century.<ref name="Neuhoff" /> Shankar popularized performing on the bass octave of the sitar for the ''alap'' section, became known for a distinctive quick playing style in the middle and high registers, and his sound creation through stops and strikes on the main playing string.<ref name="Neuhoff" /><ref name="NewGrove" /> ''[[Musik in Geschichte und Gegenwart]]'' has argued that Shankar's playing style was not widely adopted and that he was surpassed by other sitar players in the performance of melodic passages.<ref name="Neuhoff" /> Shankar's interplay with [[Alla Rakha]] improved appreciation for [[tabla]] playing in [[Hindustani classical music]].<ref name="Neuhoff" /> He promoted the ''[[jugalbandi]]'' duet concert style and introduced new ragas, including Tilak Shyam, Nat Bhairav and Bairagi.<ref name="NewGrove" />
