He gained worldwide fame as a member of [[The Beatles]], with [[John Lennon]], [[George Harrison]], and [[Ringo Starr]]. McCartney and Lennon formed one of the most influential and successful [[Lennon/McCartney|songwriting partnerships]] and "wrote some of the most popular music in rock and roll history".<ref>[http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/h2g2/A5950929 "The Lennon-McCartney Songwriting Partnership"] ''bbc.co.uk'', 4 November 2005. bbc.co.uk/dna/h2g2 - Retrieved 14 December 2006</ref> After leaving The Beatles, McCartney launched a successful solo career and formed the band [[Wings (band)|Wings]] with his first wife, [[Linda McCartney|Linda Eastman McCartney]], and singer-songwriter [[Denny Laine]]. He has worked on film scores, classical music, and ambient/electronica music; released a large catalogue of songs as a solo artist; and taken part in projects to help international [[Charitable organization|charities]].

McCartney is listed in ''[[Guinness World Records]]'' as the most successful musician and composer in [[popular music]] history, with 60 [[Music recording sales certification|gold discs]] and sales of 100 million [[Single (music)|singles]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.independent.co.uk/people/profiles/article1089708.ece|title=Paul McCartney: When I'm 64|publisher=[[The Independent]] | location=London | first=Paul | last=Vallely | date=2006-06-17 | accessdate=2010-05-08}} independent.co.uk - Retrieved 17 June 2006</ref> His song "[[Yesterday (song)|Yesterday]]" is listed as the most [[cover version|covered]] song in history  - by over 3,700 artists so far - and has been played more than 7,000,000 times on American television and radio. Wings' 1977 single "[[Mull of Kintyre (song)|Mull of Kintyre]]" became the first single to sell more than two million copies in the UK, and remains the UK's top selling non-charity single.<ref>[http://ukcharts.20m.com/bestsell.html "The UK's Best Selling Singles"] ukcharts.20m.com - Retrieved 23 September 2007.</ref>
(Three charity singles have since surpassed it in sales; the first to do so<U+2014>in 1984<U+2014>was [[Band Aid (band)|Band Aid]]'s "[[Do They Know It's Christmas]]?", whose participants included McCartney.)

His company [[MPL Communications]] owns the copyrights to more than 3,000 songs,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0005200/bio |title=Paul McCartney - Biography  |last=Shelokhonov |first=Steve |publisher=IMDB.com - Retrieved 8 March 2008}}</ref> including all of the songs written by [[Buddy Holly]], along with the publishing rights to such musicals as ''[[Guys and Dolls (musical)|Guys and Dolls]]'', ''[[A Chorus Line]]'', and ''[[Grease (musical)|Grease]]''.
