''Cilvia Demo'' was met with generally positive reviews from [[music critic]]s. Rob Markman of [[MTV]] gave the EP a positive review saying, "By the time the 14-track project winds down, Isaiah Rashad slowly doles out his own coming-of-age story using introspective raps, melodies and, at times, good old southern bounce."<ref>http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1721326/isaiah-rashad-cilvia-demo-album.jhtml</ref> Marcus Dowling of [[HipHopDX]] said, "Every story and hook on Isaiah Rashad's ''Cilvia Demo'' connects on a human level. What it lacks in depth is covered by excellent production and raw talent."<ref>http://www.hiphopdx.com/index/album-reviews/id.2218/title.isaiah-rashad-cilvia-demo</ref>
