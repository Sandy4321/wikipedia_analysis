'''Charlotte Anita Whitney''' (July 7, 1867{{ndash}}February 4, 1955), best known as "Anita Whitney," was an [[United States|American]] women's rights activist, political activist, suffragist, and early [[Communist Labor Party]] and [[Communist Party USA]] organizer in California. She is best remembered as the defendant in a landmark [[California]] [[criminal syndicalism]] trial.

==Biography==
===Early life===

Anita Whitney was born in [[San Francisco, California|San Francisco]], [[California]] on July 7, 1867, the daughter of a preeminent family whose members included the [[Supreme Court of the United States|American Supreme Court]] [[Supreme Court Justice|Justice]] [[Stephen Johnson Field]] and the multi-millionaire speculator and magnate [[Cyrus W. Field]]. Her father was a lawyer.<ref name="ALWW">Solon DeLeon with Irma C. Hayssen and Grace Poole (eds.), ''American Labor Who's Who.'' New York: Hanford Press, 1925; pg. 249.</ref>

Whitney attended both private and public school growing up in [[Oakland, California]], across the bay from San Francisco.<ref name="ALWW" /> When her education in Oakland was complete, she attended a [[normal school]] in [[San Jose, California]] before leaving for the East Coast to attend [[Wellesley College]], from which she graduated in 1889.<ref name="ALWW" />

Following graduation, Whitney worked for a time as teacher.

In 1893, Whitney visited a slum in [[New York City]]. profoundly affected, she soon developed an interest in social work. In 1901, she took over as the new Executive Secretary of the United Charities of Oakland, California.<ref>''Charities: A Weekly Review of Local and General Philantropy,'' vol. 7, no. 1 (July-December 1901), pg. 348.</ref> She continued in this capacity until 1908.<ref name="ALWW" />

The same impulse that drove her to seek betterment in the lives of the poor and downtrodden apparently also led her to campaign actively for [[women's suffrage]]: two decades before women across the nation were [[Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|entitled to vote]], Whitney took part in a series of early voting rights campaigns ranging from California to [[Connecticut]]. By 1911, Whitney's interest in the women's rights movement led her to become the California organizer of the [[National College Equal Suffrage League]], a position which she retained until 1913.<ref name="ALWW" /> She would later serve as Vice President of the [[National American Woman Suffrage Association]].<ref name="Famous American Women">Robert McHenry, ''Famous American Women: A Biographical Dictionary from Colonial Times to the Present''.

===Becoming a "Red"===

When [[World War I]] broke out in [[Europe]], Whitney, who was a [[pacifist]], became a member of the anti-war [[Socialist Party of America]], joining the party meetings of the [[Oakland, California|Oakland]] branch.<ref name="Famous American Women"/><ref>Epstein, Lee, and Thomas G. Walker. ''Constitutional Law for a Changing America: Rights, Liberties, and Justice''. Second Edition. CQ Press, 1995; pg. 219.</ref> When the more radical members of the Socialist Party bolted the [[1919 Emergency National Convention]] of the Socialist Party  in [[Chicago]] and elected to create an American Communist party, Whitney, who did not think the Socialist Party sufficiently [[Progressivism|progressive]], threw herself into the Communists' cause, drumming up support for the new [[Communist Labor Party of America|Communist Labor Party]] throughout California. 

Following a speech to a group of Oakland leftists on behalf of the party in 1919, she was arrested for "criminal syndicalism"{{ndash}}though even the safely mainstream ''[[Time Magazine]]'' considered her to have been convicted "because of her membership in the Communist Labor Party."<ref name = "Case of Miss Whitney">[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,728578,00.html "The Case of Miss Whitney".] ''Time Magazine'' 2 Nov. 1925. Retrieved 27 Apr. 2009.</ref>

Although the organized crackdowns against the Communists would wane for about three decades after the [[Palmer Raids|1919 Red Scare]], Whitney's conviction was upheld by the [[United States Supreme Court]] in [[Whitney v. California]] (1927), although the concurring opinion by [[Louis Brandeis|Justice Brandeis]] would be accepted as a case for revoking the restrictions against the Communists after a subsequent wave of imprisonments during the 1950s. Noting her ill health, officials permitted her release after a little more than a week, although she would continue to fight for an appeal.<ref name="Famous American Women"/> 

Still dogged by criminal charges from her 1919 arrest, Whitney ran for California [[state comptroller]] in 1924{{ndash}}waging a relentless political campaign that garnered over 100,000 votes.<ref name="Famous American Women"/>

In 1935, she was again convicted by the California court system{{ndash}}this time related to election fraud, since eight circulators had made false attestations during a pre-election petition campaign, although the state watchdogs saw fit to add additional charges of "lecturing without a permit" and "distributing radical literature."<ref name = "Britannica">[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/642885/Charlotte-Anita-Whitney" Charlotte Anita Whitney".] ''[[Encyclopaedia Britannica]]''. 2009. ''Encyclopaedia Britannica Online''. Retrieved 27 Apr. 2009.</ref> Her stature among radicals only enhanced by the conviction, Whitney was named the national chairwoman of the Communist Party in 1936. 

California's Communists nominated Whitney for the [[U.S. Senate]] twice.

Anita Whitney's popularity among the country's radical leftists never evaporated: although trailed by a protracted record of political harassment, compounded by the fever-pitch [[anti-communism]] promoted locally by anti-communist screen actor and future governor [[Ronald Reagan]] in [[Los Angeles]] and across the nation by [[Joe McCarthy|Wisconsin Senator McCarthy]], her 1950 campaign for Senator won close to 99,000 votes.

===Death and legacy===

Anita Whitney died on February 4, 1955, aged 87, in San Francisco, California.
