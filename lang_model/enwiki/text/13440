"'''Coming Home'''" is a song by American rapper and producer [[Sean Combs|Diddy]] and his band [[Diddy-Dirty Money|Dirty Money]], from their debut album ''[[Last Train to Paris]]'' (2010). It was released on November 21, 2010, as the album's fourth single. The contemporary [[Hip hop music|hip-hop]] [[pop music|pop]] song was written by [[J. Cole|Jermaine Cole]],  Diddy, [[Jay-Z]], [[Alex da Kid]] and [[Skylar Grey]]. Kid and Jay-Z produced the song while Grey featured vocals on the song's chorus. Jay-Z and Kid gifted the song to Diddy for ''Last Train to Paris''. [[Autobiographical]]ly written, "Coming Home" is inspired by moments in Diddy's life, the loss of his close friend, [[The Notorious B.I.G]] and references to classic songs by [[Dionne Warwick]] and [[Smokey Robinson & the Miracles]].

Critics praised the redemptive ballad for the personal themes and lyrics which were a snapshot of Diddy's life. Praise was also given for Grey's soft vocals which complemented the warmth of the song. An accompanying music video, directed by Rich Lee, follows the trio wandering through the desert in search of home only to find burned belongings and the shell of a home. Singled out as one of the album's highlights, "Coming Home" was promoted with live TV performances including at the [[American Music Awards]] on November 21, 2010, the ''[[WWE Tribute to the Troops]]'' concert, and the March 10, 2011 episode of ''[[American Idol]]'' which marked the first live performance of the song featuring Skylar Grey.

To date, "Coming Home" is Diddy-Dirty Money's most successful single and the highest charting single from ''Last Train to Paris''. Aside from amassing one million digital sales, it peaked at number eleven on the U.S. [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] and number nine in Canada. Internationally, the single topped both Belgium [[Ultratip]] charts and the [[Swiss Singles Chart]], as well as reaching top five in the UK. This comes in addition to breaking onto the A-playlists on British [[BBC Radio 1Xtra|urban music radio]] and [[BBC Radio 1|mainstream radio]], and topping the [[UK R&B Chart|UK R&B Singles]] chart for three consecutive weeks.

== Critical reception ==

=== Synopsis ===
"Coming Home" starts with scenes of a black helicopter flying over the desert. In some of the shots, Diddy can be seen looking out on to the horizon. As the song progresses into its main verses, the camera follows Diddy walking through the desert. In the background and foreground, the fire-damaged remnants of a home such as a TV set, fur coats and a stereo system are scattered across the landscape. During the chorus [[Dawn Richard (singer)|Dawn Richard]] and [[Kalenna Harper]] take place in front of the camera, walking behind Diddy miming Grey's words. Later in the clip, during the second verse, Diddy sits in a burned out building singing to himself. Outside, a burned out vehicle is parked. Then during the song's [[Bridge (music)|bridge]], red smoke surrounds Diddy as the helicopter, from the opening scene, comes to land. However, this time Richard and Harper are seated inside waiting for Diddy. As the song fades, the helicopter flies over the desert toward the horizon.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rap-up.com/2010/11/29/video-diddy-dirty-money-coming-home/ |title=VIDEO: DIDDY-DIRTY MONEY <U+2013> <U+2018>COMING HOME<U+2019> |work=[[Rap-Up]] |date=November 29, 2010 |accessdate=December 26, 2010}}</ref>

=== Reception ===
Staff from [[E!|E! Online]] seemed impressed with the video's concept and choice of background scenery. They said "what better place for some introspection than the desert, right? No sexy bikini-clad ladies or blue-haired [[Nicki Minaj]]s to distract you, and when you're done, just call up the helicopter to pick you up (Pro tip: Hang your leg outside of the chopper for extra cool points.)".<ref name="EOL Staff"/> Stephen Gottlieb from Video Static said "It's a nice bookend with Diddy's <U+2013> then Puff Daddy <U+2013> first solo video, "[[Can't Nobody Hold Me Down]]," which featured him and [[Mase]] introducing an era of big budget hip-hop while driving a Rolls convertible across the desert."<ref name="Gottlieb"/> While Ed Easton Jr. from 92.3 Now FM drew comparisons to Diddy's earlier video for his 1997 hit single "[[Been Around the World]]", thus awarding the video six out of ten. However Easton was annoyed with the number of videos being released and said that fans were waiting for the actual album to be released.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://923now.radio.com/2010/11/30/diddy-dirty-money-coming-home-video/ |title=Diddy-Dirty Money <U+2013> "Coming Home" Video Premiere |last=Easton Jr. |first=Ed |date=November 30, 2010 |accessdate=December 28, 2010 |publisher=92.3 Now FM}}</ref>
