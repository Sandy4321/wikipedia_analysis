The '''Cape lobster''', '''''Homarinus capensis''''', is a species of small [[lobster]] that lives off the coast of [[South Africa]], from [[Dassen Island]] to [[Haga Haga]]. Only a few dozen specimens are known, mostly regurgitated by reef-dwelling fish. It lives in rocky reefs, and is thought to lay large eggs that have a short [[crustacean larvae|larval phase]], or that hatch directly as a [[juvenile (organism)|juvenile]]. The species grows to a total length of {{convert|10|cm|abbr=on}}, and resembles a small [[Homarus gammarus|European]] or [[American lobster]]; it was previously included in the same genus, ''[[Homarus]]'', although it is not very closely related to those species, and is now considered to form a separate, monotypic genus <U+2013> '''''Homarinus'''''. Its closest relatives are the genera ''[[Thymops]]'' and ''[[Thymopides]]''.

The Cape lobster is [[endemism|endemic]] to [[South Africa]]. It occurs from [[Dassen Island]], [[Western Cape]] in the west to [[Haga Haga]], [[Eastern Cape]] in the east, a range of {{convert|900|km}}.<ref name="Kado"/> Most of the known specimens were [[Regurgitation (digestion)|regurgitated]] by fish caught on [[reef]]s at depths of {{convert|20|-|40|m}}.<ref name="Kado"/> This suggests that the Cape lobster inhabits rocky substrates, and may explain its apparent rarity, since such areas are not amenable to [[dredging]] or [[trawling]], and the species may be too small to be retained by [[lobster trap]]s.<ref name="Kado"/>

==Description==
''Homarinus capensis'' is considerably smaller than the large northern lobsters of the [[Atlantic Ocean]], ''[[Homarus gammarus]]'' (the European lobster) and ''[[Homarus americanus]]'' (the American lobster), at {{convert|8|-|10|cm}} total length, or {{convert|4|-|5|cm|abbr=on}} [[carapace]] length.<ref name="MLW">{{cite book |url=ftp://ftp.fao.org/docrep/fao/009/t0411e/t0411e09.pdf |format=[[Portable Document Format|PDF]] |chapter=''Homarus'' Weber, 1795 |page=57<U+2013>60 |series=FAO Species Catalogue, Volume 13 |title=Marine Lobsters of the World |author=Lipke B.

==Taxonomy and evolution==
Cape lobsters are elusive and rare, with only fourteen specimens having been collected between 1792 (the date of its first description) and 1992.<ref name="KWS95"/> These include five males in the collections of the [[South African Museum]] ([[Cape Town]]), two in the [[Natural History Museum]] ([[London]]), one in each of the [[East London Museum]], the {{lang|nl|[[Rijksmuseum van Natuurlijke Historie]]}} ([[Leiden]]) and the [[Albany Museum]] ([[Grahamstown]]), and one male and one female in the {{lang|fr|[[Mus<U+00E9>um national d'histoire naturelle]]}} ([[Paris]]).<ref name="Wolff">{{cite journal |author=Torben Wolff |year=1978 |title=Maximum size of lobsters (''Homarus'') (Decapoda, Nephropidae) |journal=[[Crustaceana]] |volume=34 |issue=1 |pages=1-14 |jstor=20103244}}</ref> In 1992, a Cape lobster was discovered at [[Dassen Island]], and the publicity the find generated resulted in more than 20 additional specimens being reported.<ref name="Kado">{{cite journal |author=Ryusuke Kado, Jiro Kittaka, Yasuhiro Hayakawa & D.
