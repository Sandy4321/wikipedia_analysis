'''Sue Ellen Ewing''' ([[n<U+00E9>e]] '''Shepard'''; later '''Lockwood''') is a [[fictional character]] and one of the female leads in the [[CBS]] primetime [[soap opera]] ''[[Dallas (TV series)|Dallas]]''. Sue Ellen is portrayed by actress [[Linda Gray]], and has appeared on the show since its [[List of Dallas episodes#Mini-series (April 1978)|pilot episode]], first broadcast on  April 2, 1978. ''Dallas'' follows the trials of the wealthy Ewing oil family in the town of [[Dallas, Texas]], of which Sue Ellen is married into through her husband, the notoriously evil [[J.R. Ewing]]. Gray played Sue Ellen until the twelfth season of ''Dallas'', when her character finally leaves Texas after beating J.R. at his own game, seen in the episode "[[The_Long_Goodbye_(Dallas)#Season_Eleven_.281988-1989.29|Reel Life]]".  However, Gray later returned for the series finale "[[The_Long_Goodbye_(Dallas)#Season_Thirteen_.281990-1991.29|Conundrum Part II]]", the subsequent [[The_Long_Goodbye_(Dallas)#Telemovies_and_Reunions_.281986_-_2004.29|''Dallas'' telemovies]] ("[[Dallas: J.R. Returns|J.R. Returns]]" and "[[Dallas: War of the Ewings|War of the Ewings]]"), and the reunion special entitled "''[[Dallas Reunion: The Return to Southfork]]''", which aired in 2004, and reunited her with former castmates.<ref name= "Return to Southfork">{{cite web|title= CBS Special: Return to Southfork|work= Ultimate Dallas.com |publisher= [[CBS]]|date=November 7, 2004|url= http://www.ultimatedallas.com/returntosouthfork/ }}</ref>  

Sue Ellen's storylines in the [[List of Dallas episodes#Season One (1978-1979)|first season]] focus on the characters bout with [[alcohol]] and her slowly deteriorating relationship with her husband. The final episode of the season focused on the birth of her son with J.R., [[John Ross Ewing III]]. While her relationship with J.R. is not always harmonious, it's a significant aspect of her overall character. As the series progressed, Sue Ellen came into her own as an individual character. The actress has said of her character's personality: "I never wanted her to be boring. She was never boring before - she started out kind of boring, but I think that's the kiss of death because people will expect her to be interesting." Gray later described Sue Ellen as being, "one of the most interesting characters on TV in the 1980s. She was the original ''[[Desperate Housewife]]''. She led the way for all those girls."<ref name = "Mirror"/>  

In 2010, [[TNT (TV channel)|TNT]] (sister company to [[Warner Bros. Television]], the current copyright owners of the series) announced they were producing a new, [[Dallas (2012 TV series)|updated ''Dallas'' series]].<ref name="People.com"/> It is a continuation of the original series and will primarily center around Sue Ellen and [[J.R.

==Character portrayal and development==
===Casting and creation===
When Gray originally tested for ''[[Dallas (TV series)|Dallas]]'', the role of Sue Ellen was merely that of a background character. The actress recounts that the part was a "mere walk-on" and there hadn't been any need for a formal audition.<ref name = "UD">{{cite news|title= Give Her the Simple Life |work = The Staff of [[TV Guide]]|publisher= [[TV Guide (Canada)]]|date=November 24, 1979 | location=Canada}}</ref> In fact, Gray had to do an impromptu audition over the telephone because the role was not considered important enough to bring in another actor to test for the part,<ref name = "UD"/> though the actress later stated that ''[[Newhart]]'' innkeeper [[Mary Frann]] was also considered to play the character while the producers were casting the show.<ref name = "Gray TV G">{{cite news|title= Bottoms Up, Linda Gray!|work = Ileane Rudolph and Ben Katner|publisher= [[TV Guide]]|date=November 5, 2004|url=http://www.tvguide.com/news/dallas-gray-linda-37924.aspx|accessdate=2010-08-31 | location=United States}}</ref> In an interview with ''TV Guide'', Gray confirmed: "She [Frann] had the part. [[Victoria Principal]] was a brunette, and so was I, and Mary was a blond, and [the producers] wanted that [visual] contrast. But the casting director [who had only recently tapped me to play a [[transsexual]] on ''[[All That Glitters (TV series)|All That Glitters]]''] kept bugging them until they finally said, 'OK, we'll read her.'"<ref name = "Gray TV G"/> Once the show was picked up for a full season, Gray and fellow actor [[Steve Kanaly]] ([[Ray Krebbs]]) were both upgraded to starring roles.<ref name="Dallas: The Complete Story">''Dallas: The Complete Story of the World's Favorite Prime-Time Soap'', pp. 24<U+2013>25</ref> 

After staying with the show for eight seasons, Gray ran into trouble when she requested the producers of the show to allow in her contract the ability to direct, like that of male co-stars Duffy and Hagman. The request initially led to producers firing the actress from the serial, though the decision was later reversed when ''Dallas'' star [[Larry Hagman]] threatened to quit the show unless Gray was rehired.<ref name = "Gray TV G"/> Gray stated in an interview with ''[[TV Guide]]'', "The producers said, 'But you're doing so well.' I thought, 'Oh, look out! I'm on the warpath now.' It was a struggle, though, because it was a man's show. And they fired me. When I finally told Larry, he went with me into the office and said, 'If she doesn't come back, I don't come back. I can't be playing J.R. Ewing without Sue Ellen.' He was very loyal and, honestly, a very smart businessman. He knew that truly, it was a huge relationship to the show." We'll drink to that!"<ref name = "Gray TV G"/> 

The actress also recounted the story to Alan Mercer of ''Dazzling Diva.com'', saying: "I told them I don't want any more money. I just want to direct one episode in the next two year cycle. I didn't think that was so horrible. I didn't want to direct six episodes. They still said no. Basically, I was fired at the end of year eight. So, I said good-bye, and Larry said 'see you next season.' I told him I won't be coming back. He said, "What!?!" I told him, "They fired me because I want to direct one episode, and if that's their stance, I'm out of here." He was stunned and he said if you go I go. He denies that to this day. He really went to bat for me."<ref name = "Gray DD">{{cite web|title= Linda Gray can do it all!|work = Alan Mercer|publisher= Dazzling Divas.com|date=April 24, 2011|url=http://dazzlingdivas-ladivas.blogspot.com/2011/04/linda-gray-can-do-it-all-interview-alan.html|accessdate=2010-08-31 |location=United States}}</ref> Gray remained a member of the principal cast until she left the show in its [[List_of_Dallas_episodes#Season_Twelve_.281988-1989.29|twelfth season]].<ref name= "Gray Leaving">{{cite web|title= Sue Ellen Leaving Southfork|work= [[The Milwaukee Journal]]|publisher= [[Journal Communications]]|date=February 22, 1989 |location=United States}}</ref> Her departure came as a surprise, but her publicist said that after eleven years on the show, she wished to pursue other things.<ref name= "Gray Leaving"/> In 2010, [[TNT (TV channel)|TNT]] (sister company to [[Warner Bros.

===Characterization===
[[File:Linda Gray.jpg|thumb|right|190px|Linda Gray has said that she considers Sue Ellen "one of the most interesting female characters on television in the 1980's".]]
In 1979, Gray spoke with ''[[TV Guide (Canada)]]'' and recounted: "At first, they had no idea what to do with the part. Sue Ellen's lines ran to 'More coffee, darling?' and 'I have a headache.' Victoria Principal and [[Patrick Duffy]] were the goody-goddies. [[Jim Davis (actor)|Jim Davis]] and [[Barbara Bel Geddes]] were parental. Hagman was the villain. And I was the redhead on the couch."<ref name = "UD"/> However, Gray was upgraded to a starring role once ''Dallas'' was picked up for a full season following the [[List_of_Dallas_episodes#Mini-Series_.28April_1978.29|five episode arc miniseries]]. The actress later stated that on-screen husband Larry Hagman had criticized one of her performances early on during the start of the series, and called it "terrible", though he denied it. She joked, "I'm sorry. He said it to me loud and clear, and made me feel terrible, and it started one of our first fights on the way back [to the motel where everyone was staying]. I swear to you <U+2014> he devastated me. Then, years later, he said, 'Oh, I didn't mean that.' I could have killed him!"<ref name = "Gray TV G"/>

Throughout the serial, Sue Ellen often suffered emotional abuse from her husband J.R., who was the primary antagonist of the show.<ref name = "First Housewife">{{cite news|title= Gray: I was the very first desperate housewife |publisher= Daily Telegraph|date=July 10, 2006|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/3653731/I-was-the-very-first-desperate-housewife.html|accessdate=2010-08-31|location=London |first=Jan | last=Moir}}</ref> Linda Gray described Sue Ellen as being, "one of the most interesting character on TV in the 1980s.

We set fashion trends in the 80s. Those shoulder pads did get a bit wild. They had to make doors bigger in the end."<ref name = "Mirror"/> In an interview with ''[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]'', she said: "It was kind of exciting. I played this neurotic, psychotic, alcoholic weirdo. But I still say she was the most interesting female on television in the eighties."<ref name = "First Housewife"/> The character of Sue Ellen has gone through an addiction to alcohol, which she returned to every-time something went extremely wrong with her life. Gray was particularly fond of doing these scenes. She commented, 
<blockquote>
"I loved my drunk scenes. I know that may sound very strange to people! I got to just let go and just do a down and dirty version of Sue Ellen. It was like, 'Just let me at it and roll those cameras'. I remember being in makeup for 20 minutes, which normally took two hours. They put some kind of gel in my hair and some very light makeup and I loved it. I said, "Just let me go, please don't edit me, just let me go'." She added, "It was just one of those charming, charming, charming times where I just got to blow it out. I just wanted Sue Ellen to be raw unlike any other time in her life, where she was the victim and she was this and she was that; [[J.R. Ewing]] would do something and she would react, he would do something and she would have an affair or drink or whatever. This was just like, 'Let me go. Let Sue Ellen out of that box'"<ref name= "I liked Drunk Scenes"/>   
</blockquote>

In an interview with ''[[Digital Spy]]'', Gray said of her character's persona: "I never wanted her to be boring. She was never boring before&ndash;she started out kind of boring, but I think that's the kiss of death because people will expect her to be interesting. By interesting, that doesn't mean she's drunk. I had to do a lot of thinking about what we would do with her. Where would she be now? I did a lot of homework finding out where she would be and what Texas women are like now. What has she gone through in her life? What has she come to grips with? What does she like about herself? What doesn't she like about herself? What kind of impact is she going to make on her life, on [[John Ross Ewing III|John Ross]]'s life, on her future? Who is she?"<ref name= "I liked Drunk Scenes">{{cite web|title= 'Dallas' Linda Gray interview: 'I liked Sue Ellen's drunk scenes'|author= Catriona Weightman|publisher= Digital Spy.com|date=September 29, 2011|url=http://www.digitalspy.com/tv/interviews/a342756/dallas-linda-gray-interview-i-liked-sue-ellens-drunk-scenes.html }}</ref>

==Reception==
For her work as Sue Ellen, Gray was nominated for a [[Primetime Emmy Award]] in the category "Best Actress in a Drama Series" in 1981 ([[Barbara Bel Geddes]] who played [[Miss Ellie Ewing]] was also nominated in that category for ''Dallas'' that year).<ref name = "Linda Gray.com">{{cite news|title= Linda Gray Official Website: Biography|url= http://www.lindagray.com/biography.html |work =[[Linda Gray]].com|publisher= The Staff of Linda Gray.com|accessdate=March 25, 2012| location=United States}}</ref> Gray was also nominated for a [[Golden Globe Award]] in both 1980 and 1981 in the category of "Best Performance by an Actress in a Television Series - Drama" respectively.<ref name = "Linda Gray A&N">{{cite news|title= Linda Gray- Awards and Nominations|url= http://movies.msn.com/celebrities/celebrity-awards-and-nominations/linda-gray.2/ |work =MSN.com|publisher=[[MSN]]|accessdate=March 25, 2012| location=United States}}</ref> The character of Sue Ellen was well received by television critics. ''[[The Biography Channel]]'' said, "Who could ever forget Dallas with the gin-swilling Sue Ellen Ewing, replete with shoulder pads long before ''[[Dynasty (TV series)|Dynasty]]'', staggering around [[Southfork Ranch]] with a permanently tearful expression as she suffered the brunt of J.R.
