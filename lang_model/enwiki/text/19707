'''Avraham Kalmanowitz''' (1891 <U+2013> 15 February 1964) was an [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox]] [[rabbi]] and [[rosh yeshiva]] of the [[Mir yeshiva (Brooklyn)|Mir yeshiva]] in [[Brooklyn]], [[New York]] from 1946 to 1964. Born in [[Belarus]], he served as [[Rav]] of several Eastern European Jewish communities and escaped to the United States in 1940 following the [[Occupation of Poland (1939<U+2013>1945)|German occupation of Poland]]. In the U.S. he became a tireless rescue activist on behalf of the millions of Jews trapped in [[Nazism|Nazi]] Europe and in the [[Soviet Union]]. He is credited with the successful transfer of the entire [[Mir yeshiva (Belarus)|Mir yeshiva]] from [[Lithuania]] to [[Shanghai]], providing for its support for five years, and obtaining [[Visa (document)|visas]] and travel fare to bring all 250 students and faculty to America after World War II. He established the U.S. branch of the Mir in 1946. In the 1950s he aided North African and Syrian Jewish youth suffering from persecution and pogroms, and successfully lobbied for the passage of a bill granting "endangered refugee status" to [[Jewish exodus from Arab and Muslim countries|Jewish emigrants from Arab lands]].

In 1913 he married the granddaughter of Rabbi Betzalel Hakohen, a [[Beth din#Officers of a beth din|dayan]] (rabbinical court judge) in [[Vilna]] and author of the [[Talmud]]ic commentary ''Mareh Kohen'', which appears in all printed editions of the Talmud.<ref name="chaim">Shapiro, Chaim.

Kalmanowitz became a central rabbinic figure and communal leader, working on behalf of refugees and Jews in difficult straits.

In 1929 he accepted the position of Rav and ''[[Beth din#Officers of a beth din|av beis din]]'' (head of the rabbinical court) of [[Tykocin]] (Tiktin), and established a yeshiva in that town.<ref name="JVL"/><ref name="alex"/><ref name="adar">{{cite web |url=http://matzav.com/todays-yahrtzeits-history-2-3-adar |title=Today<U+2019>s Yahrtzeits & History <U+2013> 2<U+2013>3 Adar |date=24 February 2012 |accessdate=23 August 2012 |publisher=matzav.com}}</ref> He was also a member of the [[Moetzes Gedolei HaTorah]] (Council of Torah Sages) of the [[World Agudath Israel]].<ref name="bio"/> He was forced to flee Tiktin for [[Bialystok]] after stopping a [[pogrom]] planned by local anti-Semitic elements, who slandered him to the local authorities.<ref name=faygie/>

Kalmanowitz openly [[Shomer Shabbat|desecrated the Shabbat]] on several occasions in the name of ''[[pikuach nefesh]]'' (the Jewish principle of saving lives) by fund-raising in synagogues, filling out forms, and riding in taxis to government and institutional offices on [[Shabbat]] to obtain approvals and funds.<ref name="ross"/><ref name="save">"A Cry From the Heart: Rabbi Avraham Kalmanowitz", in ''[http://books.google.co.il/books?id=gLkWAQAAIAAJ&q=to+save+a+world&dq=to+save+a+world&hl=en&sa=X&ei=shUMUInzC_K00QXi75WvCg&ved=0CDMQ6AEwAQ To Save a World: Profiles of Holocaust Rescue]'' by Dr. David Kranzler and Rabbi Eliezer Gevirtz.

In 1946 Kalmanowitz established a new branch of the Mir yeshiva in [[New York City]]. The yeshiva was first established in temporary quarters in [[Far Rockaway]] and [[Brownsville, Brooklyn|Brownsville]], and then in a permanent home in the [[Flatbush, Brooklyn|Flatbush]] neighborhood of Brooklyn, where it thrives to this day.<ref name="daniel"/>

==Rescue work in North Africa==
In the late 1940s and 1950s, Kalmanowitz inundated government, United Nations, and church officials with appeals to stop persecutions and pogroms against [[History of the Jews in Egypt|Jews in Egypt]] and [[History of the Jews in Syria|Syria]] that eventually resulted in the dissolution of those communities. His efforts led to the passage of a bill according "endangered refugee status" to Jews in Arab lands, paving the way for their immigration to the United States.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.elmorahillsminyan.org/Home/gedolim/european-gedolim/how-rav-avrohom-kalmanowitz-zt%E2%80%9Dl-helped-save-egyptian-and-syrian-jewry |first=Avrohom |last=Birnbaum |title=The Story of How Rav Avrohom Kalmanowitz zt"l Helped Save Egyptian and Syrian Jewry <U+2013> Part I |work=[[Yated Ne'eman (United States)|Yated Ne'eman]]|accessdate=23 August 2012}}</ref><ref name="arab">{{cite web |url=http://www.elmorahillsminyan.org/Home/gedolim/european-gedolim/the-story-of-how-rav-avrohom-kalmanowitz-zt%E2%80%9Dl-helped-save-egyptian-and-syrian-jewry |title=The Story of How Rav Avrohom Kalmanowitz zt"l Helped Save Egyptian and Syrian Jewry <U+2013> Part II |first=Avrohom |last=Birnbaum|work=Yated Ne'eman|accessdate=23 August 2012}}</ref>

Kalmanowitz worked onsite to strengthen traditional Torah education among North African Jewish youth. Together with the leaders of Jewish communities in [[Morocco]] and [[Tunisia]], he helped found the Otzar HaTorah educational network, which established 28 yeshivas and 20 [[Talmud Torah]]s, as well as girls schools, in those countries in 1947 and 1948.<ref name=faygie/> Kalmanowitz also devised and pushed through a plan granting student visas to the Mir yeshiva in Brooklyn for North African Jewish teens and opened special sections in the yeshiva for them, even though the yeshiva's financial situation was dire.<ref name="JVL"/><ref name="arab"/> A group of 13 boys arrived from Morocco in 1948, but most left the yeshivah to find jobs. One of those who remained was Avraham Portal, a native of [[Marrakech]], who returned to Morocco in 1953 so he could apply for permanent residency status in the United States and in the meantime became the educational supervisor for the Otzar HaTorah network in the French region of Morocco. Portal returned to the Mir in 1956 with a hand-picked group of 15 boys and taught them in a separate program that became the Mir's first high school class.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mishpacha.com/Browse/Article/1987/The-Etrog-Picker |last=Kobre |first=Eytan |title=The Etrog Picker |work=[[Mishpacha]] Special Supplement: "Between the Lines: Letters from the heart and the lives they linked" |date=2 April 2012|pages=46<U+2013>53}}</ref> Another beneficiary of Kalmanowitz's largesse was Rabbi [[David Rebibo]], a Moroccan-born student in France who used the student visa Kalmanowitz sent him to come study at the Mir in 1953. Afterwards Kalmanowitz helped Rebibo find his first teaching job. Rebibo has been dean of the [[Phoenix Hebrew Academy]] and senior rabbi of Beth Jacob Congregation in [[Phoenix, Arizona]] since 1965.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.jewishaz.com/jewishnews/041112/rebibo.shtml |title= Brooklyn yeshiva honors Rebibo |first=Leisah |last=Namm |date=12 November 2004 |accessdate=23 August 2012 |work=[[Jewish News of Greater Phoenix]]}}</ref>

==Death and legacy==
During a fund-raising trip to Florida in 1964, Kalmanowitz suffered a [[heart attack]]<ref name=faygie/> and died in [[Miami Beach, Florida|Miami Beach]] on 15 February 1964 (2 [[Adar]] 5724) at the age of 73.<ref name="ross"/> He was eulogized in large funerals in front of the Mir yeshivas in New York and Jerusalem,<ref name=faygie/> and afterwards buried in the [[Sanhedria Cemetery]] in [[Jerusalem]] next to his father.<ref name="ross"/>
