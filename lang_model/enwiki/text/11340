==Background==
===Peace-negotiations===
The peace-negotiations with Taliban were announced by the Pakistani Prime Minister [[Nawaz Sharif]], as he came to power after the elections.<ref name="bbc">{{cite news|author=Shahzeb Jillani |url=http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-26065385 |title=Pakistan enters peace talks with Taliban |publisher=BBC |date=6 February 2014 |accessdate=15 June 2014 | archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6Qhy9iNEJ | archivedate=30 June 2014}}</ref> Previous attempts to engage the Taliban in a dialogue process had failed. The first session of the talks was held on 26 March 2014, at Khyber Pakhtunkhwa House, [[Islamabad]].<ref name="bbc2">{{cite news|url=http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-26731838 |title=First day of Pakistan Taliban peace talks concluded |publisher=BBC |date=26 March 2014 |accessdate=15 June 2014 | archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6QhyCYa5e | archivedate=30 June 2014}}</ref> These talks were held by the committees appointed by the [[Government of Pakistan]] and Taliban. The Taliban did not name representatives from within their own ranks and instead nominated pro-Taliban religious figures to represent their views.<ref name="bbc" /> The Taliban called for the implementation of [[Sharia|Sharia law]] in Pakistan, whereas the Pakistani government demanded hostilities to be ceased, and insisted that the talks should be held within the framework of the [[Constitution of Pakistan]].<ref name="bbc" /> A month-long ceasefire was reached between the government and Taliban on 1 March 2014.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.dawn.com/news/1090330/pakistani-taliban-announce-month-long-ceasefire |title=Pakistani Taliban announce month-long ceasefire <U+2013> Pakistan |work=Dawn|location=Pakistan |accessdate=15 June 2014 | archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6QhyFIeIf | archivedate=30 June 2014}}</ref>

The talks involved travelling of the government representatives to the area near the Afghan border by helicopter, and meetings also took place at Khyber Pakhtunkhwa House. The government had indicated that stronger military action will be used if negotiations fail.<ref name="bbc2" />

====Peace-negotiations failure====
The peace-negotiations collapsed after the execution of 23 Pakistani [[Frontier Corps]] soldiers by the Taliban on 17 February 2014.<ref>{{cite news|last=Crilly |first=Rob |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/pakistan/10643505/Peace-talks-collapse-as-Taliban-execute-23-Pakistani-soldiers.html |title=Peace talks collapse as Taliban execute 23 Pakistani soldiers |work=The Daily Telegraph |date=17 February 2014 |accessdate=15 June 2014 | archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6QhyPnMw2 | archivedate=30 June 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/02/17/us-pakistan-taliban-idUSBREA1G0MP20140217 | title=Peace talks between Pakistan and Taliban collapse after killings | work=Maria Golovnina and Amjad Ali | date=17 February 2014 | agency=Reuters | accessdate=15 June 2014 | last=Golovnina | first=Maria | archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6QhyTWnhp | archivedate=30 June 2014}}</ref> The soldiers had been held by the insurgents since 2010.

More than 90 militants were killed in Taliban infighting since March 2014.

===Jinnah Airport attack===

The operation started exactly a week after the terrorist attack on Pakistan's busiest airport. On 8 June 2014, 10 militants of [[Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan|TTP]] and [[Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan]] attacked [[Jinnah International Airport]] in [[Karachi]], [[Pakistan]], killing 36 people, including all 10 attackers, and wounding at least 18 persons.<ref name=aje>{{cite news|title=Heavy fighting reported at Karachi airport|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/asia/2014/06/heavy-fighting-reported-at-karachi-airport-201468185852200231.html|publisher=[[Al Jazeera]]|accessdate=8 June 2014|date=8 June 2014}}</ref>

The operation will continue until it reaches its logical conclusion. Any group that challenges Pakistan's constitution, attacks civilians, soldiers, and government installations and uses Pakistani territory to plan terrorist attacks will be targeted," he said.
He added that IDPs will be facilitated by the federal as well as KP governments.

*The first phase of the operation started with intensified airstrikes which targeted the militant training facilities, hideouts and other infrastructure.<ref name="ground">{{cite news |url=http://www.pakistantoday.com.pk/2014/06/26/national/operation-zarb-e-azb-ground-offensive-initiates/ | title=Operation Zarb-e-Azb: Ground offensive initiates | work=Pakistan Today | date=26 June 2014 | accessdate=27 June 2014 | archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6QeMPrEEF | archivedate=27 June 2014}}</ref>
*The Pakistani military intensified air strikes in [[North Waziristan]], and destroyed eight militant hideouts in the previous night airstrikes. Militant hideouts in Degan-Boya, Datta Khel in [[North Waziristan]] were targeted by jet aircraft. There were confirmed reports of the presence of foreign and local insurgents in these hideouts who were linked in planning the Karachi airport attack. An ammunition dump was also destroyed.
