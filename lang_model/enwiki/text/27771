'''Julie Corletto''' ([[n<U+00E9>e]] '''Prendergast'''; born 31 October 1986) is an Australian international [[netball]] player. She usually plays in the positions of goal defence and goal keeper.

==Career==
Corletto started playing netball at aged 10 in home town of Kerang. She made her [[Commonwealth Bank Trophy]] debut at the age of 16 for the [[Melbourne Phoenix]], where her style of defence saw her named [[Netball Australia]]'s best new talent. She was selected in the Australian open squad at the age of 17. In 2005 she captained the Australian U/21 team to a bronze medal at the World Youth Championships, while on the comeback trail from a stress fracture in her foot.

In 2007 Corletto was recruited from the Melbourne Phoenix to cross-town rivals, [[Melbourne Kestrels]]. Also that year, she was named in the [[Australia national netball team|Australian national team]] to tour England in a tri-series. However, after injuring her ankle in the first minutes of the season opener, the local derby between Phoenix and Kestrels, she was forced to pull out, with Melbourne Kestrels team-mate [[Rebecca Bulley]] called up in her place. But a few months later Corletto went on to make an impressive debut for Australia against [[The Sunshine Girls (team)|Jamaica]], and played goal defence during a subsequent Australian series win against [[Silver Ferns|New Zealand]]. In November 2007, she won her first ever world championship title, as the youngest member of the victorious Australian team.

In 2008 Corletto signed with the [[Melbourne Vixens]] to play in the new trans-Tasman [[ANZ Championship]]. She will again play for the Vixens in the 2009 season, after marrying [[Melbourne Tigers]] basketballer [[Daryl Corletto]]. Once again, Corletto has signed with the Vixens to play the 2010 season. Corletto is the younger sister of former AFL footballer [[Ian Prendergast]].

In 2012 it was announced that Corletto would be playing for the New Zealand team the [[Northern Mystics]] for the 2013 season, following her husband Daryl Corletto who re-signed with the [[New Zealand Breakers]].<ref>Dana Johannsen [http://www.nzherald.co.nz/sport/news/article.cfm?c_id=4&objectid=10829880 "Netball: Sport's courting couple reunited as Mystic's new signing hits town"] New Zealand, 28 August 2012.
