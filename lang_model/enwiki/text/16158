The '''Francis Marion National Forest''' is located north of [[Charleston, South Carolina]]. It is named for revolutionary war hero [[Francis Marion]], who was known to the British as the Swamp Fox. 

This National Forest is contained entirely in the counties of [[Charleston County, South Carolina|Charleston]] and [[Berkeley County, South Carolina|Berkeley]] and is {{convert|252368|acre|km2|-1}} in size. The forest contains the towns of [[Awendaw, South Carolina|Avendaw]], [[Huger, South Carolina|Huger]], [[Jamestown, South Carolina|Jamestown]], and [[McClellanville, South Carolina|McClellanville]]. Charleston provides emergency services to the southeastern portions of the forest. Forest headquarters are located in [[Columbia, South Carolina|Columbia]], together with those of [[Sumter National Forest]]. There are local [[ranger district]] offices located in [[Cordesville, South Carolina|Cordesville]].

In 1989, the forest was nearly destroyed by [[Hurricane Hugo]]; only the young growth survived the storm and its aftermath. Today, most trees in the forest do not predate this hurricane. 

The forest is a multiple use area. Recreation opportunities include campsites, rifle ranges, boat ramps, and several trails for hiking, horseback riding, and mountain biking, including the [[Palmetto Trail]]. The Forest Service also administers wilderness areas, experimental forests, timber production, and protection and management of [[wildlife]] and the [[drainage basin|watershed]].
