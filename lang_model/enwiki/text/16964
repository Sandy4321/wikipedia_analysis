'''Friendship''' (formerly known as Meduncook) is a [[New England town|town]] in [[Knox County, Maine|Knox County]], [[Maine]], [[United States]]. The population was 1,152 at the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]].

==History==
[[Abenaki]] [[Native Americans of the United States|Indians]] called it Meduncook, meaning "[[bay]] at the end of the [[sandbar]]." Part of the [[Waldo Patent]], it was first settled in 1750. A [[garrison]] was built on Garrison Island, which connects to the mainland at [[low tide]]. By 1754, 22 families lived in Meduncook, most taking shelter within the garrison when the [[French and Indian War]] broke out.

=== Raid on Meduncook (1758) ===
During the French and Indian War, the community was raided twice. The first attack was from Indians just after sunrise on May 22, 1758.<ref name="Maine p. 333">The history of the state of Maine: from its first discovery, A. D ..., Volume 2 By William Durkee Williamson, p. 333</ref> They killed and [[scalping|scalped]] Joshua and Hannah Bradford and their infant son Winslow. An original settler from [[Kingston, Massachusetts]] and great-grandson of [[William Bradford (Plymouth governor)|Governor William Bradford]], he had remained in his house, believing it close enough to the garrison that his family could flee there when necessary. But while pounding corn, the Bradfords missed hearing the garrison's alarm gun. Five of their children managed to escape their pursuers into the fort, but two of their sons Cornelius (21) and Joshua (12) were captured and carried to Canada.<ref name=Coolidge>{{Cite book | last = Coolidge | first = Austin J.| coauthors = John B.

After trying to lay siege to [[Thomaston, Maine]] in September 1758, a party of Indians and Acadians under the command of French Officer [[Charles Deschamps de Boish<U+00E9>bert et de Raffetot|Boishebert]] raided the village. Eight British were captured or killed.<ref name="Maine p. 333"/>

On February 25, 1807, Meduncook Plantation was incorporated as Friendship. By 1859, when the population was 691, the village had two [[shipbuilding|shipbuilders]], two [[gristmill]]s, one [[roof shingle|shingle]] mill and three [[sawmill]]s. By 1880, when the population was 938, other manufactures included [[sail]]s, [[carriage]]s, [[boot]]s and [[shoemaking|shoes]]. But boatbuilding remained the dominant industry in town, which became famous for producing the [[Friendship Sloop]], a [[gaff rig|gaff-rigged]] [[sailboat]] designed for [[lobster fishing|lobstering]] and [[fishing]]. Each summer the town hosts the Friendship Sloop Races.<ref>{{Citation
