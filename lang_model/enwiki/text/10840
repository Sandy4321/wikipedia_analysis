'''Eugene Francis''' "'''Gene'''" '''Fama''' (born February 14, 1939) is an American economist and Nobel laureate in Economics, known for his work on [[portfolio theory]] and [[asset pricing]], both theoretical and empirical.

He is currently Robert R. McCormick Distinguished Service Professor of Finance at the [[University of Chicago Booth School of Business]]. He was awarded the 2013 [[Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences]] jointly with [[Robert Shiller]] and [[Lars Peter Hansen]].

==Career==
He earned his undergraduate degree in [[French (language)|French]] from [[Tufts University]] in 1960 and his [[Master in Business Administration|M.B.A.]] and [[Ph.D.]] from the [[University of Chicago Booth School of Business|Booth School of Business]] at the [[University of Chicago]] in [[economics]] and [[finance]]. His doctoral supervisors were Nobel prize winner [[Merton Miller]] and Harry Roberts, but [[Benoit Mandelbrot]] was also an important influence.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://genealogy.math.ndsu.nodak.edu/id.php?id=81048 |title=Mathematics Genealogy Project |publisher=Genealogy.math.ndsu.nodak.edu |date= |accessdate=2013-10-14}}</ref>  He has spent all of his teaching career at the [[University of Chicago]].

His Ph.D. thesis, which concluded that [[stock]] price movements are unpredictable and follow a [[random walk]], was published in January, 1965 issue of the ''[[Journal of Business]]'', entitled "The Behavior of Stock Market Prices".  That work was subsequently rewritten into a less technical article, "Random Walks In Stock Market Prices",<ref>{{cite journal |last=Fama |first=Eugene F. |year=1965 |month=September/October |title=Random Walks In Stock Market Prices |journal=Financial Analysts Journal |volume=21 |issue=5 |pages=55<U+2013>59 |url= |accessdate= |doi=10.2469/faj.v21.n5.55}}</ref> which was published in the ''[[Financial Analysts Journal]]'' in 1965 and ''Institutional Investor'' in 1968.

His article "The Adjustment of Stock Prices to New Information" in the ''[[International Economic Review]]'', 1969 (with several co-authors) was the first [[event study]] that sought to analyze how stock prices respond to an event,  using price data from the newly available [[Center for Research in Securities Prices|CRSP]] database.  This was the first of literally hundreds of such published studies.{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}}

===Efficient market hypothesis===
{{main|Efficient-market hypothesis}}
Fama is most often thought of as the father of the efficient-market hypothesis, beginning with his Ph.D. thesis. In a ground-breaking article in the May, 1970 issue of the ''[[Journal of Finance]]'', entitled "Efficient Capital Markets: A Review of Theory and Empirical Work," <ref>{{cite web|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1540-6261.1970.tb00518.x/full |title=EFFICIENT CAPITAL MARKETS: A REVIEW OF THEORY AND EMPIRICAL WORK - Malkiel - 2012 - The Journal of Finance - Wiley Online Library |publisher=Onlinelibrary.wiley.com |date= |accessdate=2013-10-14}}</ref> Fama proposed two crucial concepts that have defined the conversation on efficient markets ever since. First, Fama proposed three types of efficiency: (i) strong-form; (ii) semi-strong form; and (iii) weak efficiency. They are explained in the context of what information are factored in price. In weak form efficiency the information set is just historical prices, which can be predicted from historical price trend; thus, it is impossible to profit from it. Semi-strong form requires that all public information is reflected in prices already, such as companies' announcements or annual earnings figures. Finally, the strong-form concerns all information, including private information are incorporated in price; it states no monopolistic information can entail profits, in other words, insider trading cannot make a profit in the strong-form market efficiency world.
Second, Fama demonstrated that the notion of market efficiency could not be rejected without an accompanying rejection of the model of market equilibrium (e.g. the price setting mechanism). This concept, known as the "[[joint hypothesis problem]]," has ever since vexed researchers. Market efficiency denotes how information is factored in price, Fama (1970) emphasizes that the hypothesis of market efficiency must be tested in the context of expected returns. The joint hypothesis problem states that when a model yields a return significantly different from the actual return, one can never be certain if there exists an imperfection in the model or if the market is inefficient. Researchers can only modify their models by adding different factors to eliminate any anomalies, in hopes of fully explaining the return within the model. The anomaly, also known as alpha in the modeling test, thus functions as a signal to the model maker whether it can perfectly predict returns by the factors in the model. However, as long as there exists an alpha, neither the conclusion of a flawed model nor market inefficiency can be drawn according to the Joint Hypothesis. Fama (1991) also stresses that market efficiency per se is not testable and can only be tested jointly with some model of equilibrium, i.e. an asset-pricing model.

===Fama<U+2013>French three-factor model===
{{main|Fama<U+2013>French three-factor model}}
In recent years, Fama has become controversial again, for a series of papers, co-written with [[Kenneth French]], that cast doubt on the validity of the [[Capital asset pricing model|Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM)]], which posits that a stock's [[Beta (finance)|beta]] alone should explain its average return. These papers describe two factors above and beyond a stock's market beta which can explain differences in stock returns: market capitalization and "value".  They also offer evidence that a variety of patterns in average returns, often labeled as "anomalies" in past work, can be explained with their [[Fama<U+2013>French three-factor model]].<ref name="FamaFrench1993">{{Cite journal |last=Fama |first=Eugene F. |coauthors=French, Kenneth R. |year=1993 |title=Common Risk Factors in the Returns on Stocks and Bonds |journal=Journal of Financial Economics |volume=33 |issue=1 |pages=3<U+2013>56 |url= |issn= |doi=10.1016/0304-405X(93)90023-5 }}</ref>
