'''''Mortimer His Fall''''' is an unfinished history play by [[Ben Jonson]], about the usurpation of [[Roger Mortimer, 1st Earl of March]], who conspired with [[Isabella of France]] to overthrow Isabella's husband [[Edward II of England]]. 

The existing text of ''Mortimer, His Fall,'' was printed as a coda to the 1640 edition of Jonson's complete works. The text comprises the "argument", or plot summary of the intended five acts, along with one complete scene and part of another scene. The complete scene is a soliloquy by Mortimer in which he is portrayed, "in the 'Machiavel' tradition", as a scheming villain plotting to grab power. The fragmentary scene is the beginning of a dialogue between Mortimer and Queen Isabella.<ref>Irving Ribner, ''The English History Play in the Age of Shakespeare'', Princeton University Press, Princeton, NJ, 1957, p.292.</ref>

==Date==
Jonson's historical tragedies were all written in the period 1602-4, and it has been argued that ''Mortimer'' may be identical to the play "Mortymore", referred to by [[Philip Henslowe]] in 1602, for which Henslowe provided "ij sewtes a licke" (two suits alike).<ref>Felix E. Schelling, ''The English Chronicle Play: A Study in the Popular Historical Literature Environing Shakespeare'', Macmillan Company, New York, 1902, p.142.</ref> However, it is generally believed that the work was a very late one, left unfinished at his death in 1637.<ref>James Loxley, ''The Complete Critical Guide to Ben Jonson'', Routledge, New York, 2001, p.99.</ref> The published version states "he dyed and left it unfinished". [[William Gifford]] described it as "the last draught of Jonson's quill".<ref name = "bif">David Riggs, ''Ben Jonson: A Life'', Harvard University Press, 1989, p.346.</ref>

==Style==
The play seems to have been an attempt to move away from the traditional chronicle history plays towards a more classical form, as it seems to have included "choruses", such as "Ladyes celebrating the worthinesse of the Queene," and "Countrey Justices and their Wives telling how they were deluded and made beleeve the old king lived." Jonson's biographer David Riggs describes it as Jonson's attempt at a "final amalgamation of the classical and native tragedy".<ref name = "bif"/>

==Content==
Mortimer is identified as a vainglorious figure whose pride is the cause of his actions. The "argument" of the first act states:

{{quote|The first Act comprehends Mortimers pride and securitie, raysed to the degree of an Earle, by the Queenes favour, and love. Mortimers securitie, scorne of the Nobilitie, too much familiaritie with the Queene, related by the Chorus, the report of the Kings surprizing him in his Mothers bed-chamber, a generall gladnesse, his being sent to execution.<ref name = "ss">Gregory W. Bredbeck, ''Sodomy and Interpretation: Marlowe to Milton'', Cornell University Press, Ithaca, NY, 1991, p.64</ref>}}

Mortimer's "Senecan pride and ambition" is expressed in his soliloquy in which he glories in his new title: "This Rise is made, yet! and we now stand, ranck'd, / To view about us, all that were above us!"<ref name = "ss"/>
