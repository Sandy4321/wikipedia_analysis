'''The Whitlams''' are a [[piano rock|piano-based rock]] band formed in 1992 from Sydney Australia. The original band consisted of [[Tim Freedman]], [[Stevie Plunder]] and [[Andy Lewis]].

The Whitlams formed in 1992 in Newtown, Australia and began their career performing acoustically on Saturday afternoons at the Sandringham Hotel in King Street, Newtown.

Although the band line-up has changed numerous times the current line-up has remained unchanged since 2001, and consists of Tim Freedman on piano and vocals, [[Jak Housden]] on guitar, [[Warwick Hornby]] on bass guitar and [[Terepai Richmond]] on drums.

<!-- '''The Whitlams''' are an Australian band, best known for their songs "[[No Aphrodisiac]]",  "[[You Sound Like Louis Burdett]]" and "[[Blow Up the Pokies]]". The Whitlams sound can best be described as '[[Piano rock]]' founded in 'lyrics of charming cynicism {{Fact|date=February 2007}}'. The band's name is a tribute to former Australian [[Prime Minister]] [[Gough Whitlam]]. Early in their career, they performed a small number of shows under the [[pseudonym]] ''The Moody Jews''<ref>From the Timeline off the "The Whitlams Years 1993-2004" DVD.</ref>.-->

== History ==

=== Formation and early years (1992-1995) ===

[[Image:Original-Whitlams.jpg|thumb|right|The original Whitlams: <br/>Tim, Andy, Stevie (L-R)]]

The Whitlams were formed in late 1992 when a former Penguin on Safari <!-- Tim Freedman --> and a former Plunderer <!-- Stevie Plunder --> crossed paths at the annual independent music festival the [[Big Day Out]]. While missing [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]] perform inside the arena, the two musicians lamented the local music scene and decided to form a musical alliance, and The Whitlams were born. The initial band members were [[Tim Freedman]], [[Stevie Plunder]] and [[Andy Lewis (bassist)|Andy Lewis]]. Being without a drummer, the band developed their songs acoustically on Saturday afternoons at the [[Sandringham Hotel, Newtown|Sandringham Hotel]] in [[King Street, Newtown|King Street]], [[Newtown, New South Wales|Newtown]], an [[Inner West (Sydney)|inner west]] suburb of [[Sydney, Australia]].

=== ''Eternal Nightcap'' and ''Love This City'' (1996-2000) ===
At the same time that the band was enjoying the success of their single "I Make Hamburgers" (1996) founding member Stevie Plunder was found dead  on [[Australia Day]], 1996, from what was believed to be an act of [[suicide]]. After a break of several months, Tim Freedman reformed the band with several new members.  After several more months, there was another lineup change and this is when the process of starting to record the album ''[[Eternal Nightcap]]'' began. This album sold over 200,000 units and in 1998 won the band [[Australian Record Industry Association|ARIA]] awards for Best Independent Album, Song of the Year and Best Group. This last award was presented by the band's namesake Gough Whitlam. "[[No Aphrodisiac]]", a single from this album, made it to number one in the [[Triple J Hottest 100, 1997|1997 Triple J Hottest 100]]. 

Several of the band's songs were played during the [[2000 Summer Olympics|2000 Sydney Olympics]] as examples of Australian [[pop culture]] (for example, "Sydney 2000 Olympic Theme", a b-side from the "I Make Hamburgers" single that was reworked as "You Gotta Love This City" on ''[[Love This City]]'' -- an [[irony|ironic]] choice, as the song's [[protagonist]] commits suicide by jumping in the [[Port Jackson|Harbour]] at the end of the song, disgusted at the city's crass pursuit of money: ''It dawns on him / The horror / We got the Olympic Games'').

{{Listen|filename=The_Whitlams_-_Blow_Up_The_Pokies.ogg|title=Blow Up The Pokies |description=||format=[[Ogg]]|right}}
</div>

During the band's Canadian tour in April 2000 supporting ''[[Blue Rodeo]]'', the band received word that founding member, Andy Lewis, had committed suicide back in Australia. Andy had been battling gambling addiction for a long time prior to his death. 

The single "Blow Up the Pokies" had been co-written <!-- lyrics by Tim --> by Tim as a statement on the destruction he saw in Andy's life due to his gambling not long before Andy's death, and was awaiting release as a single at the time. Tim soon after wrote "The Curse Stops Here", a heartrending piece describing being the 'last one' from the original line-up of the band, and voicing his determination to survive. "The Curse Stops Here" was included as a B-side track on the "Blow Up the Pokies" single.

A month after Andy's death a benefit concert was held at the Metro club in Sydney to raise money for his wife and child. The event was hosted by [[Paul McDermott (comedian)|Paul McDermott]], [[Mikey Robbins]] and [[Steve Abbott]] ([[The Sandman]]), and performers included [[Max Sharam]], and [[The Gadflys]] (another band Andy performed with).

=== ''Torch the Moon'' and ''Little Cloud'' (2001-2006) ===

''Torch The Moon'' (2002), their next album, received moderate success, with the singles "Fall For You" (AUS#21), "Best Work" (AUS#35), "Royal in the Afternoon" and "Don't Believe Anymore". Another song from the album which received a fair amount of airplay was "I Will Not Go Quietly (Duffy's Song)", which was used on the Australian TV series ''Love Is A Four Letter Word'' (2001).

The latest release, a double-album titled ''Little Cloud'' (loosely referred to also as ''Little Cloud and The Apples Eye'') was released on [[19 March]] [[2006]] in Australia. Several songs are receiving considerable airplay, including "I Was Alive." Three of the songs on the album have been released as radio-only singles, with a fourth, "Beautiful as You", released as a CD single.  The album was followed up with almost non-stop touring around Australia, including performances at political and university events.

The band made the news in 2006 when they refused to perform to troops in [[Iraq war|Iraq]] for political reasons.[http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,20867,20467600-29277,00.html]

=== The Whitlams and the Sydney Symphony Orchestra (2007) ===

The band performed a short orchestral tour in late 2007, performing shows with the [[Sydney Symphony]], [[Adelaide Symphony Orchestra]], [[West Australian Symphony Orchestra]] and the [[The Queensland Orchestra]] [http://www.thewhitlams.com/NEWS/].

In 2008 The Whitlams released a free CD in The Sunday Telegraph (June 1) and The Australian (July 26) of their live performance with the Sydney Symphony Orchestra.

=== ''Truth, Beauty and a Picture of You'' (2008-present) ===
The Whitlams released a 'Best of' compilation album titled "[[Truth, Beauty and a Picture of You]]" on August 2, 2008.
As part of the promotion for "Truth, Beauty and a Picture of You" release, and subsequent tour, the Whitlams performed on a number of TV programs including Nine's "Footy Show (NRL)" and Seven's "Sunrise" and "The Morning Show"
