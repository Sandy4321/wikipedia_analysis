'''Severe Tropical Cyclone Joy''' in late 1990 produced the third highest floods on record in [[Rockhampton]], [[Queensland]], a town in northeastern Australia. In the middle of December 1990, the cyclone formed as a [[low pressure area|tropical low]] near the [[Solomon Islands]] and initially moved westward. On December&nbsp;18, it was named Joy, the second [[tropical cyclone naming|named storm]] of the [[1990<U+2013>91 Australian region cyclone season]], which continued intensifying after turning to the southwest. Developing a well-defined [[eye (cyclone)|eye]], Joy strengthened to reach [[maximum sustained wind]]s of 165&nbsp;km/h (100&nbsp;mph) while approaching the city of [[Cairns]]. After brushing the city with strong winds, the cyclone weakened and turned to the southeast. Joy later turned back to the southwest and made [[landfall (meteorology)|landfall]] near [[Townsville]], Queensland on December&nbsp;26. It dissipated the next day, although its remnants persisted across Queensland for two weeks, dropping torrential rainfall.

While drifting offshore northeastern Australia, Cyclone Joy produced gusts of 124&nbsp;km/h (77&nbsp;mph) in Cairns, strong enough to cause power outages. In [[Mackay, Queensland|Mackay]], a tornado damaged 40&nbsp;homes, while torrential rainfall south of the track peaked at over {{Convert|2|m|ft|abbr=on}} south of the city. In general, damage was heaviest from the flooding, which in some locations lasted for weeks. The rains increased levels along 10&nbsp;rivers, including the [[Fitzroy River (Queensland)|Fitzroy River]] which discharged about 18&nbsp;trillion litre (4.9&nbsp;trillion gallons) of [[discharge (hydrology)|discharge]] into [[Keppel Bay]] over 25&nbsp;days, damaging the [[Great Barrier Reef]] through [[coral bleaching]] and decreased salinity. The Fitzroy River isolated [[Rockhampton]] when it rose to its third highest level on record to a crest of {{convert|9.30|m|ft|abbr=on}}. Thousands were forced to evacuate their homes, and stranded residents required helicopters to airdrop food. Elsewhere in Australia, moisture from the storm eased fires near [[Sydney]]. Overall, Joy killed six people and caused $300&nbsp;million in damage (1990&nbsp;[[Australian dollar|AUD]], $310&nbsp;million [[United States dollar|USD]]). Following the storm, the Queensland government declared about a third of the state as disaster areas, and the name Joy was later [[List of retired Australian cyclone names|retired]] from the [[list of historic tropical cyclone names|list of tropical cyclone names]].
