The '''hamsa'''  ({{lang-ar|<U+062E><U+0645><U+0633><U+0629> }}, ''khamsa'', lit. ''five'', also romanized '''khamsa''' and '''chamsa''') is a palm-shaped [[amulet]] popular throughout the [[Middle East]]<ref name="fatima">{{Cite web|url=http://www.dphjewelry.com/art-n0908-132.html|title=Hand of Fatima Meaning}}</ref> and [[North Africa]]<ref name="beliefs">{{Cite web|url=http://www.israghost.com/eng/Superstitions.html|title=Superstitions and Old Beliefs}}</ref>. The hamsa is often incorporated in jewelry and wall hangings, as a defense against the [[evil eye]].<ref name="wisegeek">{{Cite web|url=http://www.wisegeek.com/what-is-a-hamsa.htm|title=What is a Hamsa?}}</ref> It is believed to originate in ancient practices associated with the [[Phoenicians]] of [[Carthage]]. [[Ahimsa]] (<U+0905><U+0939><U+093F><U+0902><U+0938><U+093E>): Nonviolence. Abstinence from injury, harmlessness, the not causing of pain to any living creature in thought, word, or deed at any time. This is the "main" yama. The other nine are there in support of its accomplishment.<ref name="wisegeek"></ref>

== Symbolism ==
Another Arabic name for the hamsa (or khamsa) Hamsa hands often contain an eye symbol. Depictions of the hand, the eye, or the number five in Arabic (and [[Berber]]) tradition is related to warding off the evil eye, as exemplified in the saying ''khamsa fi ainek'' ("five [fingers] in your eye").<ref name=Hamp385>Ham and Bing, 2007, [http://books.google.ca/books?id=V_IMx-YYvJYC&pg=PA385&dq=khamsa+evil+eye#v=onepage&q=khamsa%20evil%20eye&f=false p. 385].</ref> Another formula uttered against the evil eye in Arabic is ''khamsa wa-khamis''.<ref name=Lentp169>Lent et al., 1997, p. 189.</ref> 

The khamsa is the most popular of the different [[amulet]]s to ward off the evil eye in [[Egypt]] - others being the Eye, and the ''Hirz'' (a silver box containing verses of the [[Koran]]).<ref name=Badawip510>Badawi, 2004, [http://books.google.ca/books?id=ojiQTtPEFckC&pg=PA510&dq=khamsa+evil+eye&lr=#v=onepage&q=khamsa%20evil%20eye&f=false p. 510].</ref> The Hand (Khamsa) has long represented blessings, power and strength and is thus seen as potent in deflecting the evil eye.<ref name=Rajabp116>Rajab, 1989, p. 116.</ref> It's one of the most common components of jewelry in the region.<ref name=Badawip510/>

Archaeological evidence indicates that a downward pointing hamsa used as a protective amulet in the region predates its use by members of the monotheistic faiths.<ref name=Silverp201/> It is thought to have been associated with [[Tanit]], the supreme deity of [[Carthage]] ([[Phoenicia]]) whose hand (or is some cases [[vulva]]) was used to ward off the evil eye.<ref name=Silverp201/> 

The hamsa's path into Jewish culture, and its popularity particularly among the [[Sephardic]] Jewish community, can be traced through its use in Islam.<ref name=Silverp201/> [[Jew]]s sometimes call it the ''hand of [[Miriam]]'', referencing the sister of the biblical [[Moses]] and [[Aaron]].<ref name=Silverp201>Silver, 2008, [http://books.google.ca/books?id=gqyiX6bg0TYC&pg=PA201&dq=khamsa+evil+eye&lr=#v=onepage&q=&f=false p. 201].</ref> Five (''hamesh'' in Hebrew) represents the five books of the [[Torah]] for Jews. It also symbolizes the fifth letter of the Hebrew alphabet, "Heh", which represents one of God's holy names. Many Jews believe that the five fingers of the hamsa hand remind its wearer to use their five senses to praise God.

== Usage ==
There are two main styles of a hamsa hand: the stylized hamsa hand with two symmetrical thumbs, and hamsa hands that are not symmetrical and shaped like actual hands.<ref name="luckymojo">{{Cite web|url=http://www.luckymojo.com/hamsahand.html|title=The Hamsa Hand}}</ref> Either hamsa hand can be worn with the fingers pointing up or down. 

The hamsa is popular as a charm most often worn as a necklace, but can be found as a decorative element in houses, on key chains, on other jewelry items.<ref name="beliefs"></ref> Many artists use the image of the hamsa hand in jewelry, paintings, sculptures, wall decorations, and amulets.

The renewed interest in Kabbalah and mystical Judaism is a factor in bringing the hamsa pendant back into vogue. In [[Jewish mysticism]], fish are  a symbol of good luck, so many hamsas are also decorated with fish images. Sometimes hamsas are inscribed with Hebrew prayers, such as the [[Shema Yisrael|Sh'ma]], [[Birkat HaBayit]] ([[Blessing for the Home]]), or [[Tefilat HaDerech]] ([[Traveler's Prayer]]).
