'''USS Straus (DE-408)''' was a {{sclass|John C. Butler|destroyer escort}} acquired by the [[U.S. Navy]] during [[World War II]]. The primary purpose of the destroyer escort was to escort and protect ships in [[convoy]], in addition to other tasks as assigned, such as patrol or [[radar picket]]. Post-war, she returned home proudly with three [[battle star]]s to her credit.

She was named in honor of [[storekeeper]] second class David H. Straus, Jr. who was killed during the [[Battle of the Coral Sea]]. She was laid down on [[18 November]] [[1943]] by the [[Brown Shipbuilding]] Co., [[Houston, Texas]]; launched on [[30 December]] [[1943]]; sponsored by Mrs. David Straus; and commissioned on [[6 April]] [[1944]], Lt. Comdr. D. A. Nienstedt in command. 

== World War II Atlantic Ocean operations ==

''Straus'' was fitted out and held sea trials at [[Galveston, Texas]], until [[25 April]] when she sailed to [[Bermuda]] for her [[Shakedown (testing)|shakedown]] cruise. She then sailed to [[Boston, Massachusetts]], for a post-shakedown overhaul from [[28 May]] to [[9 June]]. The ship arrived at [[Norfolk, Virginia]], on [[11 June]] and sailed for [[Panama]] the following week as an escort for {{USS|Mississinewa|AO-59}}. The oiler loaded at [[Aruba]], off [[Venezuela]], on 23 and [[24 June]] and continued to Panama. On the evening of the 24th, the escort attacked a sound contact with [[depth charges]] and [[Hedgehog (weapon)|hedgehogs]]. Oil slicks and bubbles rose to the surface, but ''Straus'' had to break off the attack to rejoin Mississinewa. ''Straus'' left the oiler at [[Crist<U+00F3>bal, Col<U+00F3>n|Crist<U+00F3>bal]] and transited the [[Panama Canal]] on [[26 June]] to sail independently to [[California]]. 

== Transfer to the Pacific Fleet ==

''Straus'' stopped at [[San Diego, California]], for voyage repairs from 6 to [[9 July]] and then sailed westward, arriving at [[Pearl Harbor]] on the 16th. Eight days later, she sailed for the [[Marshall Islands]]. The destroyer escort arrived at [[Eniwetok]] on [[2 August]] and was assigned to the convoy screen which sailed three days later for the [[Mariana Islands|Marianas]] and arrived off [[Saipan]] on [[10 August]]. ''Straus'' was assigned to local [[antisubmarine]] patrol. On the 13th, she rescued two [[U.S. Army]] airmen from a piece of [[driftwood]] and put them ashore. From [[14 August]] to [[14 September]], ''Straus'' escorted convoys between Eniwetok and [[Guam]]. On the latter date, the ship was assigned to the [[U.S. 3rd Fleet]]. 

== Rescuing Japanese adrift at sea ==

''Straus'' stood out of [[Apra Harbor]], Guam, on [[17 September]] with a replenishment unit to join the main logistics group, [[task force|Task Group]] (TG) 30.8, that was supporting the fast carriers of Task Force (TF) 38. The destroyer was detached from the screen on the 23d to investigate a life raft reported west of [[Cocos Island]]. She found a raft carrying three Japanese Army officers and two enlisted men. A boat was dispatched to tow the raft to the ship. Before the boat reached the raft, the two enlisted men had committed suicide. The other three surrendered peacefully, after one was disarmed of a [[hand grenade]]. The next day, ''Straus'' steamed for a rendezvous with the 3d Fleet for refueling and replenishment operations, after which her unit returned to Saipan. She sailed for Eniwetok on [[1 October]]; and, upon her arrival three days later, she resumed convoy duty. 

== Intercepting infiltrating swimmers ==

''Straus'' sailed with a [[Ulithi]]-bound convoy on [[8 October]] and arrived five days later. She became station ship for the Commander, Western [[Caroline Islands|Carolines]], Patrol and Escort Group. The DE moved to the [[Palau Islands]], on [[15 November]], with her division, [[Escort Division]] 65, and was assigned to the screen around [[Peleliu]] and [[Angaur]]. On the 18th, a report was received that enemy swimmers were moving from [[Eli Malk Island]], under cover of darkness, toward Peleliu. ''Straus'' provided [[starshell]] illumination while a landing craft flotilla attacked the swimmers with [[machine guns]] and eliminated them. The ship returned to Ulithi on the 26th, and resumed her former duties until March 1945 when she was attached to the [[U.S. 5th Fleet]]. 

''Straus'' departed Ulithi on [[26 March]] with a task unit en route to rendezvous with task group TG 50.8, the main logistics group that was refueling and replenishing the fast carriers during the [[Okinawa]] operations. She remained with the group until [[26 June]]. Two days later, she sailed from Ulithi with a convoy en route to Okinawa. The ships arrived on [[2 July]], and ''Straus'' was assigned to antisubmarine patrol. The DE continued operating in the Okinawa area after the cessation of hostilities with [[Japan]]. 

== End-of-war operations ==

On [[19 September]], she sailed with TF 55 for Japan and arrived at [[Sasebo, Nagasaki|Sasebo]] the following day. The force consisted of a [[cruiser]] accompanied by five [[destroyers]] to provide a show of force before occupation forces arrived. 

''Straus'' was detached before the [[Amphibious warfare|amphibious]] forces arrived to join two [[aircraft carriers]] that were steaming off [[Ky<U+016B>sh<U+016B>]] with ready air support in case the Japanese offered resistance. She returned to Sasebo on the 25th and remained there until [[15 October]] when she weighed anchor for the [[United States]]. After port calls at Saipan and Pearl Harbor, the destroyer escort arrived at San Diego on [[5 November]] [[1945]] to begin inactivation. 

== Post-war decommissioning ==

''Straus'' remained inactive at the Naval Repair Base until [[15 January]] [[1947]] when she was decommissioned and attached to the San Diego Group of the [[Pacific Reserve Fleet]]. ''Straus'' was struck from the [[Naval Vessel Register|Navy List]] on [[1 May]] [[1966]] and used as a target in August 1973. 

== Awards ==

''Straus'' received three battle stars for World War II service.
