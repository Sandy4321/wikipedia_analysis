The '''impact of the Arab Spring''' concerns protests or by the way attempts to organize growing protest movements that were inspired by or similar to the [[Arab Spring]] in the [[Arab world|Arab-majority]] states of North Africa and the Middle East, according to commentators, organisers, and critics. These demonstrations and protest efforts have all been critical of the government in their respective countries, though they have ranged from calls for the incumbent government to make certain policy changes to attempts to bring down the current political system in its entirety. In some countries, protests have become large or widespread enough to effect change at the national level, as in [[2011 Armenian protests|Armenia]], while in others, such as [[2011 Djiboutian protests|Djibouti]], were swiftly suppressed.

Protests considered to be inspired by the Arab Spring have taken place on every inhabited continent, with varying degrees of success and prominence. On 15 October 2011, the subsidiary [[Occupy Wall Street|"Occupy"]] and [[2011 Spanish protests|Indignants]] movements inspired [[15 October 2011 global protests|protests in 950 cities in 82 countries]].

==Background==
A number of popular protests by citizens against their governments occurred in nations around the world, both following and concurrently with the Arab Spring, and many of these were reported to have been inspired by events in the Arab World starting at the end of 2010, creating a network of diffusion.<ref name="Hofheinz">Hofheinz,  Albrecht, [http://www.fes.de/ipg/IPG3_2005/07HOFHEINZ.PDF The Internet in the Arab World: Playground for Political Liberalization], International Politics and Society, 2005-03-00.</ref><ref name="Zhukov">Zhukov, Yuri and Stewart, Brandon, [http://dash.harvard.edu/bitstream/handle/1/5142122/neighbors_isq_preprint.pdf?sequence=1 Choosing your neighbors: Networks of diffusion in international relations], Forthcoming, International Studies Quarterly (Harvard), p. 1-, 19 et seq..</ref>

Some potentially vulnerable states that have not yet seen such protests have taken a variety of preemptive measures to avoid such displays occurring in their own countries; some of these states and others have experienced political fallout as a result of their own governmental actions and reactions to events which their own citizens are seeing reported from abroad.<ref name="Hofheinz" /><ref name="Hroub">Hroub, Khaled, [http://www.abc.net.au/religion/articles/2011/10/20/3344402.htm Al Jazeera: the source of Arab springs], Australian Broadcasting Corporation, 2011-10-20.</ref><ref name="barnett">Barnett, Clive, [http://oro.open.ac.uk/29008/2/Theory_and_events.pdf Theory and events], Geoforum, 42(3), pp. 263<U+2013>265, 2011.</ref><ref name="Dunn">Dunn, Alexandra, The Arab Spring: Revolution and Shifting Geopolitics: Unplugging a Nation: State Media Strategy During Egypt's January 25 Uprising, 35 Fletcher F.

On 3 February, demonstrations began when about three hundred people protested peacefully against President [[Ismail Omar Guelleh]] in [[Djibouti (city)|Djibouti City]], urging him to not run for another term; the protesters further asked for more liberty as well as for political and social reform.<ref>{{Cite news|title=People in Djibouti protest against President Gelleh|newspaper=Somaliland Press|url=http://somalilandpress.com/people-in-djibouti-protest-againts-president-gelleh-19925|accessdate=3 February 2011}}</ref> Protests soon increased, however, as thousands rallied against the president, many vowing to remain at the site until their demands were met. On 18 February, an estimated 30,000 Dijiboutians protested in central Djibouti City against the president, maintaining that the constitutional change of the previous year, which allowed him a third term, was illegal. The demonstration escalated into clashes with the police, and at least two persons were killed and many injured when police used live ammunition and teargas against the protesters.<ref name="Afrol.com">{{cite web|url=http://www.afrol.com/articles/37449 |title=Mass arrests stopped further Djibouti protests |publisher=Afrol.com |date=27 February 2011 |accessdate=6 March 2011}}</ref> On 19 and 24 February, protest leaders were arrested and after they failed to turn up on the 24th, opposition leader Bourhan Mohammed Ali stated he feared the protests had lost momentum.<ref name="Afrol.com"/> The last protest was planned for 11 March, but security forces stopped the protest and detained 4 opposition leaders.

On 29 January, riot police in [[Gabon]] fired tear gas to break up a protest by around 5,000 opposition supporters, where according to witnesses, up to 20 people were wounded. It was the second such protest since opposition leader [[Andre Mba Obame]] declared himself president on January 25 and urged people to take inspiration from Tunisia's uprising.<ref>{{cite news|title=Police use tear gas to break up Gabon protest

''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'', among other media outlets, has drawn a connection between the secular MNLA's vision for a democratic Azawad to the Arab Spring revolts, though as with many of the uprisings in the [[Middle East]], [[Islamism|Islamist]] factions have contested this view of Azawad's future.<ref name="azawad"/> Ansar Dine has called for ''[[sharia]]'' law throughout all of Mali, not just Azawad.

The rebellion and coup have been described as "fallout" from the Arab Spring, as the success of the Tuareg rebellion where it had failed in [[Tuareg rebellions (disambiguation)|previous efforts]] throughout the 20th century has been attributed largely to heavy weaponry carted out of [[Libya]] by Tuareg fighters on either side of the [[Libyan civil war]] in 2011.<ref name="ae"/><ref name="fallout"/><ref>{{cite news|url=http://oilprice.com/Metals/Gold/Gold-Producers-on-the-Edge-as-Touareg-Rebellion-Forces-Coup-in-Mali.html|agency=OilPrice.com|title=Gold Producers on the Edge as Touareg Rebellion Forces Coup in Mali|date=25 March 2012|accessdate=8 April 2012|first=Jen|last=Alic}}</ref>

===Mozambique===
According to [[Al Jazeera]], a recent protest in Mozambique was related to the Arab Spring. An elite police unit crushed a workers' protest on 6 April, detaining a number of demonstrators and leaving several injured. At least one protester died as a result of the crackdown.

The protests began after a [[Facebook]] protest group led hundreds of people to camp in tents in the center of [[Tel Aviv]] on [[Rothschild Boulevard]]. The movement soon gained momentum and began a public discourse in Israel regarding the [[Israel's housing bubble|high cost of housing]] and living expenses. The protests quickly spread to many other [[cities in Israel]] as thousands of Israeli protesters began camping in tents in the middle of central streets as a means of protest. The protesters object to the increase in housing prices in Israel, and especially in the country's major cities.

It has been suggested in the media that the protests have been inspired by the ongoing [[Arab Spring]],<ref>{{cite news|title=ISRAEL: Is the Arab Spring spreading to the Jewish state?|url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/babylonbeyond/2011/07/israel-protests-spread-demanding-social-justice.html|date=26 July 2011|accessdate=27 July 2011|work=Los Angeles Times|author=Batsheva Sobelman}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Has the Arab Spring arrived in Israel?|url=http://www.globalpost.com/dispatches/news/regions/middle-east/israel-and-palestine/has-the-arab-spring-arrived-israel|date=26 July 2011|accessdate=27 July 2011|publisher=globalpost|author=Peter Gelling}}</ref> The Israeli protests have generally been [[non-violent]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Arab Spring spirit inspires Israel tent cities|url=http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/nationworld/2015675754_israelprotests21.html|date=20 July 2011|accessdate=27 July 2011|work=The Seattle Times|author=Ethan Bronner}}</ref>

Berdimuhamedov's regime has censored all news of the protests and governmental changes. There have also been some credible reports of Turkmenistani authorities attempting to keep tabs on all citizens both inside and outside the country, with Turkmenistanis whom the government judges to have spent too much time abroad allegedly warned they could be barred either from returning to their home country, or from leaving again once they do return.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://oilandglory.foreignpolicy.com/posts/2011/04/21/the_arab_spring_the_turkmen_case|agency=Foreign Policy|date=21 April 2011|accessdate=26 April 2011|first=Muhammad|last=Tahir|title=The Arab Spring: The Turkmen case}}</ref>

At least one prominent political analyst at an Interior Ministry-affiliated university in [[Tashkent]] said the reforms were inspired by recent revolutionary events in the Middle East and [[2010 Kyrgyzstani uprising|Kyrgyzstan]], asserting that democratization and government accountability and not violence are the means to forestalling popular upheaval.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://centralasiaonline.com/cocoon/caii/xhtml/en_GB/features/caii/features/main/2011/04/14/feature-01|agency=Central Asia Online|title=Uzbekistan strengthens parliament|date=14 April 2011|accessdate=21 April 2011|first=Shakar|last=Saadi}}</ref>
