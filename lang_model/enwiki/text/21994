'''''Paid in Full''''' is the debut album by [[hip hop music|hip hop]] duo [[Eric B. & Rakim]]. It was released on July 7, 1987 through [[4th & B'way Records]]. After Rakim responded to Eric B.'s search for a rapper to complement his [[disc jockey]] work in 1985, the duo recorded the album in Manhattan's PowerPlay Studios in 1987. The album peaked at number fifty-eight on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] and produced four singles; "Eric B. Is President", "I Ain't No Joke", "I Know You Got Soul", and "Move the Crowd".

''Paid in Full'' is credited as a benchmark album of [[golden age hip hop]]. Rakim's rapping, which pioneered the use of [[internal rhyme]]s in hip hop, set a higher standard of lyricism in the genre and served as a template for future rappers. The album's heavy sampling became influential in hip hop production. The record has sold over a million copies and the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA) certified it [[RIAA certification|platinum]] in 1995. 

== Background and recording ==
Eric B. and Rakim met in 1985 after Eric B. looked for a rapper to complement his turntable work at the [[WBLS]] radio station in New York City.<ref>Simon & Schuster (2001).

''The Men Behind Def Jam: The Radical Rise of Russell Simmons and Rick Rubin'', p. 105. Omnibus Press. ISBN 0711988730</ref> Rakim's friend and roommate [[Marley Marl]] allowed him to use his home studio. The first track they recorded<U+2014>"Eric B. Is President"<U+2014>was released as a single on the independent Zakia Records in 1986. After [[Def Jam Recordings]] founder [[Russell Simmons]] heard the single, the duo were signed to [[Island Records]] and began recording the album in [[Manhattan]]'s Power Play Studios in early 1987.<ref name="ogg" /> Rakim wrote his songs in approximately one hour while listening to the beat. He then recorded his vocals in the booth by reading his lyrics from a paper. In 2006, Rakim revealed, "When I hear my first album today I hear myself reading my rhymes but I'm my worst critic."<ref>JButters (August 1, 2006).

In a 2008 interview with [[AllHipHop]], Eric B. stated, "[T]o sit here and say we put together this calculated album to be a great album would be a lie. We were just doing records that felt good."<ref name="allhiphop">Berrios, Martin A. (February 29, 2008).

Rakim's rapping deviated from the simple rhyme patterns of early 1980s hip hop.
