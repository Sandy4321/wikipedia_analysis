The '''2010 eruptions of Eyjafjallaj<U+00F6>kull''' are a sequence of volcanic events at [[Eyjafj<U+00F6>ll]] in [[Iceland]] which, although relatively small for volcanic eruptions, caused enormous disruption to air travel across western and northern [[Europe]] over an initial period of six days in April 2010. Additional localised disruption continued into May 2010.

Seismic activity started at the end of 2009 and gradually increased in intensity until on 20&nbsp;March 2010, a small [[volcanic eruption|eruption]] started that was rated as a 1 on the [[Volcanic Explosivity Index]].<ref>{{cite news |title="Eruption in Eyjafjallaj<U+00F6>kull" |publisher=University of Iceland |author=Institute of Earth Sciences |accessdate=17&nbsp;April 2010|

Beginning on 14&nbsp;April 2010, the eruption entered a second phase and created an [[Eruption column|ash cloud]] that led to the closure of most of Europe's [[Instrument Flight Rules|IFR]] airspace from 15 until 20&nbsp;April 2010. Consequently, a very high proportion of flights within, to, and from Europe were cancelled, creating the highest level of [[Air travel disruption after the 2010 Eyjafjallaj<U+00F6>kull eruption|air travel disruption]] since the [[World War 2|Second World War]].

The second phase of the eruption started on 14&nbsp;April 2010 and resulted in an estimated {{convert|250|e6m3|cuyd}} of ejected [[tephra]]. The [[Eruption column|ash plume]] rose to a height of approximately {{convert|9|km|ft}}, which rates the explosive power of the eruption as a 4 on the [[Volcanic Explosivity Index]].<ref name="smithsonianmag.com">Erica R. Hendry "[http://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/91838474.html What We Know From the Icelandic Volcano ]", ''[[Smithsonian (magazine)]]'', 22&nbsp;April 2010. Retrieved April 2010.</ref>

By 21 May 2010, the second eruption phase had subsided to the point that no further lava or ash was being produced.

By the morning of 24 May 2010, the view from the web camera installed on [http://eldgos.mila.is/eyjafjallajokull-fra-thorolfsfelli/ <U+00DE><U+00F3>r<U+00F3>lfsfell] showed only a plume of water vapour surrounded by a blueish haze caused by the emission of sulphurous gases.

Due to the large quantities of dry volcanic ash lying on the ground, surface winds frequently lifted up an "ash mist" that significantly reduced visibility and made web camera observation of the volcano impossible.<ref name="vedur1">{{cite web|url=http://en.vedur.is/earthquakes-and-volcanism/articles/nr/1884 |title=Articles < Seismicity < Icelandic Meteorological office |publisher=En.vedur.is |date= |accessdate=2010-05-28}}</ref>

By the evening of 6 June 2010, a small, new crater had opened up on the west side of the main crater from which explosive activity was observed with the emission of small quantities of ash.<ref name="www2.hi.is">http://www2.hi.is/solofile/1016022</ref>

Seismic data showed that the frequency and intensity of earth tremors still exceeds the levels observed before the eruption, therefore scientists at the [http://en.vedur.is Icelandic Meteorological Office] (IMO) and the [http://www.earthice.hi.is/ Institute of Earth Sciences, University of Iceland] (IES) continue to monitor the volcano closely.

It is situated to the north of [[Sk<U+00F3>gar]] and to the west of the larger ice cap [[M<U+00FD>rdalsj<U+00F6>kull]].

The [[ice cap]] covers the caldera of a volcano {{convert|1666|m}} in height that has erupted relatively frequently since the last [[ice age]].
The most recent major eruptions occurred in 920, 1612  (believed to have lasted only three days) and from 1821 to 1823 .<ref>{{cite web |url= http://en.vedur.is/earthquakes-and-volcanism/articles/nr/1880 |title=Eruption in Iceland - frequently asked questions |publisher=En.vedur.is |date= |accessdate=2010-04-21}}</ref>  Previous eruptions of Eyjafjallaj<U+00F6>kull have been followed by eruptions at its larger neighbour, [[Katla]];<ref>{{cite news |title="Iceland prepares for second, more devastating volcanic eruption" |publisher=TimesOnline |author=Roger Boyes |accessdate=17&nbsp;April 2010 |url= http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/europe/article7070239.ece }}</ref>. On 20&nbsp;April 2010 Icelandic President [[<U+00D3>lafur Ragnar Gr<U+00ED>msson|<U+00D3>lafur Gr<U+00ED>msson]] said that, "the time for Katla to erupt is coming close ... we [Iceland] have prepared ... it is high time for European governments and airline authorities all over the world to start planning for the eventual Katla eruption".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/newsnight/8631343.stm |title=BBC Newsnight interview with President Gr<U+00ED>msson of Iceland, 20 April 2010 |publisher=BBC News |date=2010-04-20 |accessdate=2010-06-21}}</ref>

The volcanic events starting in March 2010 are considered to be a single eruption divided into different phases. The first eruption phase ejected [[olivine]] [[basaltic andesite]] lava<ref>{{cite news |title=Gossprungan um 1 km a<U+00F0> lengd |work=Morgunbla<U+00F0>i<U+00F0> |url= http://mbl.is/mm/frettir/innlent/2010/03/21/gossprungan_um_1_km_ad_lengd/}}</ref> several hundred metres into the air in what is known as an [[effusive eruption]]. Ash ejection from this phase of the eruption is small, rising to no more than {{convert|4|km|mi}} into the atmosphere.

On 14 April 2010, however, the eruption entered an [[explosive eruption|explosive]] phase and ejected fine, glass-rich ash to over {{convert|8|km|mi}} into the atmosphere. The second phase is estimated to be a VEI 4 eruption, which is large, but not nearly the most powerful eruption possible by volcanic standards. By way of comparison, the [[Mount St. Helens]] eruption of 1980 was rated as 5 on the VEI, and the 1991 eruption of [[Mount Pinatubo]] was rated as a 6.

What made this volcanic activity so disruptive to air travel was the combination of the following four factors:
# The volcano's location is directly under the [[Jet Stream]]
# The direction of the [[Jet Stream]] was unusually stable at the time of the eruption's second phase, maintaining a continuous south-easterly heading
# The second eruptive phase took place under {{convert|200|m|ft|abbr=on}} of glacial ice. The resulting meltwater flowed back into the erupting volcano which created two specific phenomena:
## The rapidly vapourising water significantly increased the eruption's explosive power
## The erupting lava cooled very rapidly, which created a cloud of highly abrasive, glass-rich ash
# The volcano's explosive power was sufficient to inject ash directly into the Jet Stream.

Without the specific combination of the above factors, the eruption of Eyjafjallaj<U+00F6>kull would have been a medium sized, somewhat non-descript eruption that would have been of little interest to those outside the scientific community or those living in the immediate vicinity. However, the above factors were precisely those required for the Jet Stream to carry the ash directly over Northern Europe into some of the busiest airspace in the world.

== Scientific observations ==
This eruption has been assigned the volcano number [http://www.volcano.si.edu/world/volcano.cfm?vnum=1702-02= 1702-02] by the [[Global Volcanism Program]].

The [http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/aviation/vaac/vaacuk_vag.html London Volcanic Ash Advisory Centre] (VAAC), part of the UK [[Met Office]], is responsible for forecasting the presence of volcanic ash in the north-east Atlantic.  All ash dispersion models for this geographic region are produced by the VAAC in [[London]].

A study by the Icelandic Meteorological Office published on December 2009 indicated an increase in [[seismic activity]] around the [[Eyjafjallaj<U+00F6>kull]] area during the years 2006<U+2013>2009. The study reported increased activity that occurred between June and August 2009 (200&nbsp;events), compared to a total of about 250 [[earthquakes]] recorded between September 2006 and August 2009. It further indicated that the locations of most of the earthquakes in 2009 occurred between {{convert|8|to|12|km|mi}} depth east of the volcano<U+2018>s top crater.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.vedur.is/media/vedurstofan/utgafa/skyrslur/2009/VI_2009_013.pdf |title=Microsoft Word - 013_eyjafjallajok_sg2.docx |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2010-04-19}}</ref>
At the end of December 2009, seismic activity began around the Eyjafjallaj<U+00F6>kull volcano area, with thousands of small earthquakes (mostly of magnitude 1<U+2013>2&nbsp;[[Moment magnitude scale|M<sub>w</sub>]]), {{convert|7|to|10|km|mi}} beneath the volcano.<ref>Ve<U+00F0>urstofa <U+00CD>slands (5 March 2010) {{cite web | title=Jar<U+00F0>skj<U+00E1>lftahrina undir Eyjafjallaj<U+00F6>kli | work=Ve<U+00F0>urstofa <U+00CD>sland (The Meteorological Institute of Iceland) |url= http://www.vedur.is/um-vi/frettir/2010/nr/1831 }}</ref>

The radar stations of the Meteorological Institute of Iceland did not detect any appreciable amount of [[volcanic ash]]fall during the first 24&nbsp;hours of the eruption.<ref>{{cite web |title=Eldgos <U+00ED> Eyjafjallaj<U+00F6>kli |url= http://www.vedur.is/um-vi/frettir/2010/nr/1844}}</ref> However, during the night of 22&nbsp;March, they reported some [[volcanic ash]] fall reaching the Flj<U+00F3>tshl<U+00ED><U+00F0> area ({{convert|20|to|25|km|mi}} north-west of the eruption's location)<ref name=Fasteignaskra/> and Hvolsv<U+00F6>llur town ({{convert|40|km|mi}} north-west of the eruption location)<ref name=Fasteignaskra/> leaving vehicles with a fine grey layer of volcanic ash. At around 07:00 on 22&nbsp;March, an explosion launched [[eruption column]]s as far as {{convert|4|km|ft}} straight up into the air.

By 26&nbsp;February 2010 the [[Global Positioning System]] (GPS) equipment used by the [http://en.vedur.is/ Iceland Meteorological Office] at <U+00DE>orvaldseyri farm in the Eyjafj<U+00F6>ll area (around {{convert|15|km|mi}} southeast of the location of the recent eruption<ref name=Fasteignaskra>Measurements made by using maps and measurement tools from Fasteignaskr<U+00E1> <U+00CD>slandskort {{cite web |title=Fasteignaskr<U+00E1> measurement tools| url= http://www.fasteignaskra.is/pages/943}}</ref>) had shown 3&nbsp;centimetres of displacement of the local [[crust (geology)|crust]] in a southward direction, of which a 1&nbsp;centimetre displacement had taken place within four days.

This unusual seismic activity along with the rapid movement of the Earth's crust in the area gave [[geophysicist]]s evidence that magma was flowing from underneath the crust into the [[magma chamber]] of the Eyjafjallaj<U+00F6>kull volcano and that pressure stemming from the process caused (in geophysical terms) the huge crustal displacement at <U+00DE>orvaldseyri farm.<ref>Morgubla<U+00F0>i<U+00F0> (26 February 2010) {{cite web |title=Innskot undir Eyjafjallaj<U+00F6>kli |work=Morgunbla<U+00F0>i<U+00F0> |url= http://www.mbl.is/mm/frettir/innlent/2010/02/26/innskot_undir_eyjafjallajokli/}}</ref> The seismic activity continued to increase and from 3 to 5&nbsp;March, close to 3,000&nbsp;earthquakes were measured having their epicentre at the volcano.

== Phase 1: Effusive eruption==
The first phase of the eruption lasted from 20&nbsp;March to 12&nbsp;April 2010 and was characterised by alkali-olivine basalt lava flowing from various eruptive vents on the flanks of the mountain.

=== Evacuations ===
About 500 farmers and their families from the areas of [[Flj<U+00F3>tshl<U+00ED><U+00F0>]], Eyjafj<U+00F6>ll, and Landeyjar were evacuated overnight (including a group of 30 schoolchildren and their 3 teachers{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}} from [[Caistor Grammar School]] in England), and flights to and from [[Reykjav<U+00ED>k]] and [[Keflav<U+00ED>k International Airport]] were postponed, but on the evening of 21&nbsp;March, domestic and international air traffic was allowed again.<ref>[http://www.visir.is/article/20100320/FRETTIR01/946441584 Gos hafi<U+00F0> <U+00ED> Eyjafjallaj<U+00F6>kli], ''Visir'', March 21, 2010</ref><ref>[http://www.icelandair.us/information/media/newslist/detail/item426219/Volcanic_eruption_in_Eyjafjallaglacier_-_flights_to_Iceland_are_on_hold_More/ Volcanic eruption in Eyjafjallaglacier&nbsp;<U+2013> flights to Iceland are on hold].

===Fissure ===
[[File:Fimmvorduhals second fissure 2010 04 02.JPG|thumb|Second fissure, viewed from the north, on 2&nbsp;April 2010]]
The first phase of the 2010 eruption began late on the evening of 20&nbsp;March at the [[Eyjafjallaj<U+00F6>kull]] volcanic system (known locally as Eyjafj<U+00F6>ll).

The initial visual report of the eruption was at 23:52&nbsp;GMT, when a red cloud was observed at the northern slopes of [[Fimmv<U+00F6>r<U+00F0>uh<U+00E1>ls]] [[mountain pass]],<ref>{{cite web |title=Eldgosi<U+00F0> <U+00E1> Fimmv<U+00F6>r<U+00F0>uh<U+00E1>lsi |url= http://www.vedur.is/um-vi/frettir/2010/nr/1846/}}</ref><ref>[http://www.grapevine.is/News/ReadArticle/Volcano-Erupts-Under-Eyjafjallajokull Volcano Erupts Under Eyjafjallaj<U+00F6>kull] Reykjav<U+00ED>k Grapevine, March 21, 2010</ref> lighting up the sky above the eruptive site. The eruption was preceded with intense seismicity and high rates of deformation in the weeks before the eruption, in association with magma recharging of the volcano. Immediately prior to the eruption the depth of seismicity had become shallow, but was not significantly enhanced from what it had been in the previous weeks. Deformation was occurring at rates of up to a centimetre a day since 4&nbsp;March at various [[GPS]] sites installed within {{convert|12|km|mi}} from the eruptive site.

A [[fissure vent|fissure]] opened up about {{convert|150|m|ft}} in length running in a north-east to south-west direction, with 10 to 12 erupting [[lava]] craters ejecting lava at a temperature of about {{convert|1000|<U+00B0>C|-2|abbr=on}} up to {{convert|150|m|ft}} into the air.

Geophysicist Magn<U+00FA>s Tumi Einarsson said (at a press meeting in [[Hvolsv<U+00F6>llur]] on 21&nbsp;March) that this eruption is small compared to, for example, the eruption of [[Hekla]] in 2000. The eruption, rather than taking place under the ice cap of the glacier, occurred in the mountain pass between the Eyjafjallaj<U+00F6>kull and [[M<U+00FD>rdalsj<U+00F6>kull]] glaciers. As long as the fissure is not near the glacier, the risk of flooding is minimal; however, the fissure could extend into the ice cap thereby greatly increasing the risk of flooding.<ref>{{cite news |title=Eldgosi<U+00F0> er l<U+00ED>ti<U+00F0> |work=Morgunbla<U+00F0>i<U+00F0> |url= http://mbl.is/mm/frettir/innlent/2010/03/21/eldgosid_er_litid/}}</ref>

==Phase 2: Explosive eruption==

After a short hiatus in eruptive activity a new set of [[Volcanic crater|craters]] opened early in the morning of 14&nbsp;April 2010 under the volcano<U+2019>s ice covered central summit caldera. Prior to this event, a large increase in seismic activity was detected between 23:00 on 13&nbsp;April and 1:00 on 14&nbsp;April. The earthquake swarm was followed by the onset of a seismic eruption tremor. Meltwater started to emanate from the ice cap around 07:00 on 14&nbsp;April and an eruption plume was observed in the early morning. Visual observations were greatly restricted due to cloud cover over the volcano, but an airplane of the [[Icelandic Coast Guard]] imaged with eruptive craters with radar instruments.  A series of vents along a {{convert|2|km|adj=on}} long north-south oriented fissure were active, with meltwater flowing mostly down the northern slopes of the volcano, but also to the south.  An ash loaded eruption plume rose to more than {{convert|8|km|mi}}, deflected to the east by westerly winds.

=== Ash analysis ===
Samples of volcanic ash collected near the eruption showed a silica concentration of 58%<U+2014>much higher than in the lava flows.<ref>name="earthice1"</ref> The [[concentration]] of water-soluble [[fluoride]] is one third of the concentration typical in Hekla eruptions, with a [[mean value]] of 104&nbsp;milligrams of fluoride per kilogram of ash.

===Timeline of the second eruption phase===
Unlike the earlier eruption phase, the second phase occurred beneath glacial ice. Cold water from melted ice quickly chilled the lava causing it to fragment into highly abrasive glass particles that were then carried into the eruption plume. This, together with the magnitude of the eruption (estimated to be [[Volcanic Explosivity Index|VEI]] 4)<ref name="smithsonianmag.com"/> and being ten to twenty times larger than the eruption of [[Fimmv<U+00F6>r<U+00F0>uh<U+00E1>ls]] on 20&nbsp;March, injected a glass-rich ash plume into the Jet Stream.

In addition to the fact that volcanic ash is very hazardous to [[aircraft]],<ref name="Guardian_ash_halts_flights">{{cite web |url= http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/feedarticle/9032564 |title=Iceland's volcanic ash halts flights across Europe &#124; World news &#124; guardian.co.uk |publisher=Guardian |date=2008-01-23 |accessdate=2010-04-18}}</ref> the location of this eruption directly under the Jet Stream ensured that the ash was carried into the heavily used airspace over northern and central Europe.

Overall activity similar to the previous day. Geologist's field observations, taken from {{convert|2|-|10|km|mi}} from the vents, showed that explosivity was magmatic and that the tephra produced since 18 April was much coarser than during the first four days.  Explosions were heard at [[Flj<U+00F3>tshl<U+00ED><U+00F0>]], {{convert|10|-|15|km|mi}} north-west of the vents.

Meltwater discharge suggested similar lava activity.

Processing of data obtained the previous day shows that lava had advanced {{convert|400|-|500|m|ft}} northwards from the crater, forming an ice depression extending some {{convert|700|m|ft|abbr=on}} from the vents.

|| Plume elevations, magma discharge levels and tremors continued similar to the previous seven days, but with less intensity than at the peak.  There were no measurable indications that the eruption is about to end since the rate at which magma is entering the magma chamber is roughly equal to the rate at which [[tephra]] is being ejected; thus, this eruption phase appeared to be in equilibrium.  It is not known for how long such a state of equilibrium will be maintained.

The [[lava]] flow determined to have commenced on 21&nbsp;April 2010 had been melting the thick [[glacier]] ice north of the crater, resulting in water flow of 100<U+2013>120&nbsp;m<sup>3</sup>/s evident in a semi-continuous discharge of meltwater from G<U+00ED>gj<U+00F6>kull.

According to radar observations, the ash cloud averaged a height of {{convert|6|-|7|km|ft|abbr=on}} occasionally pulsating to {{convert|9|km|ft|abbr=on}}. The wind speed around the volcano had increased slightly, which reduced the height of the plume that was now drifting due east.

Ash had fallen in the Gn<U+00FA>pverjahreppur area, on the road to Stultartangi Power Station and in the Biskupstungur area (very fine particled and gray).

[[Lightning detection|ATDNet]] reports that lightning activity has been regular (up to 10 flashes per hour) and sustained.

The volcano's activity remained explosive, but there are indications that its output has lessened somewhat since the most recent maximum of 13&nbsp;May. Considerable quantities of ash have fallen on the neighbouring communities and this is expected to continue.

Fluctuations in the strength of the eruption and in ashfall can still be expected.<ref name="http://www2.hi.is/solofile/1015968">http://www2.hi.is/solofile/1015968</ref>

Ash had fallen in the Gn<U+00FA>pverjahreppur area, Hrauneyjar and in the north-east and eastern part of Iceland (from Laugar in South Thingeyjars<U+00FD>sla to [[Seydisfjordur]]). Higher [[aerosol]] concentrations have been recorded in [[Reykjav<U+00ED>k]] around midday due to ash drifting over the area.

[[Lightning detection|ATDNet]] reported more than 70 lightning strikes between midnight and midday (up to 10 flashes per hour until noon but deacresed activity in the afternoon).

The [[explosive eruption]] phase was ongoing and the height of the ash cloud suggests a tephra ejection rate in excess of 200 tonnes per second. Fallout of tephra had been detected mainly to the north-east, with recorded fallout as far as the north-east coast. Some tephra dispersion occurred towards the west in the afternoon.<ref name="http://www2.hi.is/solofile/1015968"/>

Consequently, the light grey ash cloud drifted north-west early this morning, but then according to radar, turned north by north-east.

Ash fell in the south at [[Fl<U+00FA><U+00F0>ir]], [[Flj<U+00F3>tshl<U+00ED><U+00F0>]] and Rang<U+00E1>r<U+00FE>ing ytri, and with rainfall in the north in [[H<U+00FA>sav<U+00ED>k]] and [[Skagafj<U+00F6>r<U+00F0>ur]] right before noon.

Due to heavy rainfall, the rivers in the area of [[Eyjafjallaj<U+00F6>kull]] were swollen which, together with ash from an area of a few square kilometers, resulted in a mudslide in Sva<U+00F0>b<U+00E6>li River.  This also resulted in the greatest discharge at the old bridge over the Markarflj<U+00F3>t River since 15 April.

According to radar observations, the ash cloud rose to around {{convert|5|km|ft|abbr=on}}. At the volcano, the wind was blowing from the south at {{convert|10|m/s|mph}}, but at the top of the ash cloud, the wind was south by south-westerly at {{convert|13|m/s|mph}}.

Ash fall was only reported at [[Flj<U+00F3>tsdalur]], the innermost farm in [[Flj<U+00F3>tshl<U+00ED><U+00F0>]], beginning the previous night and continuing all day.

[[Lightning detection|ATDNet]] reported ten lightning strikes between midnight and 13:00 GMT, but none since.

Water discharge in rivers around the Eyjafjallaj<U+00F6>kull glacier has decreased after the increase caused by the previous day's rainfall.  On 21 May 2010, water gauges will be installed in Bakkakot River to monitor potential mudslides, such as the one that occurred on 19 May 2010 in Sva<U+00F0>b<U+00E6>li River.

The height of the ash cloud has decreased in the last few days which suggests a decrease in magma flow (considerably less than 50 tonnes/sec) compared to the flow observed over the last week. Fluctuations in eruption activity and varying ashfall can still be expected.<ref>http://www2.hi.is/solofile/1015973</ref>

==Phase 3: Return to dormancy==
Since 21 May 2010, the eruptive vent has been emitting a column of steam (water vapour) plus sulphurous gases. Therefore there has been no further report of any ash fall from the surrounding area.

Data from seismic recorders in the area indicates that the frequency and strength of earth tremors has diminished, but is continuing.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.earthice.hi.is/page/ies_Eyjafjallajokull_eruption |title=University of Iceland reports and scientists' quotes |publisher=Earthice.hi.is |date= |accessdate=2010-06-21}}</ref>

Due to the volcano's currently quiet state, scientists from the [http://en.vedur.is Icelandic Meteorological Office] (IMO) and the IES will no longer produce status reports on a daily basis, but rather every few days; however, the volcano remains under close scientific observation.

As of 23 June 2010, the activity of Eyjafjallaj<U+00F6>kull has reduced to occasional, brief bursts of ash that travel no more than a few tens of metres.

According to pilot observations, the plume was estimated at {{convert|3|km|ft|abbr=on}} heading in a southerly direction.  The plume was completely white in colour indicating that it was composed entirely of water vapour.

There were no reports of ash fall, neither did [[Lightning detection|ATDNet]] report any lightning strikes.

Measurements made from an aircraft mounted thermal camera indicated that at the crater, the highest observable temperature was almost {{convert|100|<U+00B0>C|<U+00B0>F}}; however, the crater could not be observed directly due to the quantity of steam rising from it. No signs of magma extrusion were visible.

Seismographic data indicated that the volcanic tremors decreased to almost the level that existed before the eruption.  Further to this, GPS sensors indicated a continued horizontal displacement toward the centre of the [[Eyjafjallaj<U+00F6>kull]] volcano.  This was interpreted as showing that the magma chamber was not being replenished.

The overall assessment was that in spite of the high quantity of steam, the eruption appeared to be dormant.<ref>http://www2.hi.is/solofile/1015980</ref>

Visibility of the volcano was periodically obscured due to an ash mist that was raised by surface winds around the volcano. This reduced visibility in [[Vestmannaeyjar]] to {{convert|1|km|mi|abbr=on}} and in Vatnaskar<U+00F0>sh<U+00F3>lar to {{convert|2|km|mi}}.  Under these conditions, the view of the volcano from the web cameras was completely obscured.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www2.hi.is/page/ies_Eyjafjallajokull_eruption |title=ERUPTION in Eyjafjallaj<U+00F6>kull |publisher=.hi.is |date= |accessdate=2010-05-28}}</ref>

|| The IES conducted an expedition to the summit of Eyjafjallaj<U+00F6>kull  to measure the tephra thickness in and around the eastern half of the crater. Tephra up to {{convert|40|m|ft}} thick was measured close to the eruption vents.  Intense clouds of steam continued to rise from the vents, with occasional small ash explosions.  The noise of intense boiling and or degassing was heard, but visibility into the vents was limited due to the clouds of steam.

The crater rim was coated with a fine ash that extended {{convert|20|m|ft}} from the edge and the whole area had a strong smell of sulphur.

At 20:45 GMT the steam plume was measured to be at an altitude of {{convert|2.8|km|ft|abbr=on}}.<ref name="http://www2.hi.is/solofile/1015989">http://www2.hi.is/solofile/1015989</ref>

|- valign="top"
! 28 May
|| During the morning, the top of the mountain was hidden by clouds thus obscuring the view of the eruption plume from the web cameras.

Volcanic tremors were still more frequent than before the eruption and have been rather steady since 22 May. Small pulses, mostly in the lowest frequency range (0.5-1.0 Hz), were detected by earthquake stations around the volcano.

Rain prevented surface winds from lifting the ash around the volcano to form an ash mist.

The volcano continues to be monitored closely.<ref name="http://www2.hi.is/solofile/1015989"/>

! 1 June
|| The crater continued to emit a large quantity of steam, but for the last couple of days, the summit of the volcano was not directly observable due to cloud and mist. At 08:00 GMT, web camera observations showed the white plume to be at a height of around {{convert|2|km|ft|abbr=on}}. Winds of up to {{convert|10|m/s|mph}} blew from the east.

The volcano has not produced any ash since around 20 May 2010, but there has been widespread drifting of existing ash in southwest Iceland. High concentrations of airborne dust were reported in [[Reykjav<U+00ED>k]] on both 31 May and 1 June.

Since 22 May, a steady stream of small, pulse tremors has been detected around the volcano in the lowest frequency range (0.5Hz - 1Hz). This is a greater level of seismic activity than was detected before the eruption and is currently ongoing.<ref>http://www2.hi.is/solofile/1015998</ref>
||
|- valign="top"
! 4 June
|| On Wednesday, 2 June a white steam cloud was seen rising up to {{convert|2.5|km|ft|abbr=on}}.  On Thursday June 3, IES scientists visited the crater area and observed a considerable quantity of the steam being emitted from the crater, although it was less than the previous week.  The steam rose some {{convert|200|-|400|m|ft|abbr=on}} above the crater rim.

On 4 June south of the volcano, the wind was measured at between {{convert|8|-|13|m/s|mph}} blowing from the east.  By 19:50 GMT, the plume had been observed at a height of {{convert|4.5|km|mi|abbr=on}}.

No ash was reported emitting from the volcano, but widespread drifting of existing ash occurred in south and south-west Iceland.

In the crater area, [[solfatara]] was observed steaming out with a noise like that from a high temperature geothermal drill. Considerable rumbling noises were heard at Raufarfell ({{convert|10|km|mi}} south of the crater) during the afternoon.

During the afternoon, an increase in tremor activity was recorded at seismic stations around the volcano, but decreased in the evening.  There are still more volcanic tremors than before the eruption and the rate has fairly steady since 22 May.

An eyewitness at <U+00C1>s<U+00F3>lfssk<U+00E1>lahei<U+00F0>i ({{convert|9|km|mi}} SW of crater) observed two small flashes of lightning during the evening.

Several small and shallow earthquakes have been detected on a daily basis under the volcano.<ref>http://www2.hi.is/solofile/1016008</ref>
||
|- valign="top"
! 7 June
|| Small tremor pulses were recorded on and off during the night of 4 June and at around 09:00 GMT on 5 June, the tremors reached a maximum before decreasing again. Another increase was recorded late on 6 June for a short time and small pulses were again recorded during that night. These tremors were predominantly at high frequencies.

On the evening of 6 June, a plume of steam was observed from a plane at a height of between {{convert|4.5|-|6|km|mi|abbr=on}}. By the morning of 7 June, a steam plume was observed for a short period at a height of {{convert|3|km|ft|abbr=on}} heading in a southerly direction. The plume was mostly white in colour at the top and grayish and dark at the bottom due to continued explosive activity.  This accounts for the intermittent [[tephra]] fallout near the crater.

[[Lightning detection|ATDNet]] recorded four lightning flashes during the morning.

A considerable quantity of steam was seen emanating from the big crater and has increased since 3 June. In the western part of the crater, a new crater formed at the site of new explosive (but small) activity. Tremor pulses late on 6 June accompanied steam plumes from this new crater. Between explosions, the lava can be heard caving in within the eruptive conduit. Due to the large quantity of steam, only a part of the new active crater could seen. The glacial ice at the top is rapidly advancing to the G<U+00ED>gj<U+00F6>kull outlet glacier.

The various GPS monitoring stations around Eyjafjallaj<U+00F6>kull did not report any significant deformation.

There is some new eruptive activity on the western side of the crater with intermittent magma explosions that produce ash which falls near the crater. This explosive activity was accompanied by an abrupt increase in tremors. White steam clouds have reached a height of {{convert|6|km|ft|abbr=on}} following these explosions.<ref name="www2.hi.is"/>
||
|- valign="top"
! 10 June
|| A slight increase in seismic activity was observed on the evening of Monday, June 7 in the frequency range 1<U+2013>2 Hz. An increase was also observed in the 0.5<U+2013>1 Hz range on June 10 that was probably due to the weather.

No plume height information was available due to cloud cover.

At around 15:00 GMT on June 9, rumbling noises were heard at G<U+00ED>gj<U+00F6>kull just before a steam cloud rose from the crater.

GPS monitoring showed that over the last two days, there had been a slow and continuous deformation towards the volcano.  In the same time period, a few small, shallow earthquakes were recorded beneath the top crater.

IES scientists continue to monitor the volcano closely.<ref>http://www2.hi.is/solofile/1016027</ref>
||
|- valign="top"
! 11 June
|| The eruption plume was confined mostly to within the crater, with steam clouds occasionally rising above the crater rim.

No tephra fallout was reported, neither were any lightning strikes detected.

Heavy rainfall during the night of June 9 and early on the morning of June 10 caused considerable swelling in the Sva<U+00F0>b<U+00E6>lis<U+00E1> River.  A considerable quantity of mud has accumulated in the river channel since the eruption began, decreasing the channel's depth. The decreased channel caused water to flow up onto a road west of the bridge.  There was also sufficient mud bearing water to overflow the [[levee]] that had been erected to protect the farming land at <U+00DE>orvaldseyri.

A lake, about {{convert|300|m|ft|abbr=on}} in diameter, has formed at the bottom of the big crater. Steam has been observed rising from the rims, especially on the north side. In the morning, the steam cloud only rose about {{convert|100|m|ft|abbr=on}} over the crater but by evening, had reached a height of {{convert|500|-|1000|m|ft|abbr=on}}.

On the western side of the crater just above the surface of the water, a brown coloured cloud can be seen rising from two small openings. Mounds of sulphur have formed by steam eyes in the lava vein, just north of the crater.

The eruption did not produce any magma on this day, with the activity being confined to steaming. Water has started to accumulate in the main crater and the threat of sudden drainage creates the possibility of a significant flood down G<U+00ED>gj<U+00F6>kull in the coming weeks.<ref>http://www2.hi.is/solofile/1016035</ref>
||
|- valign="top"
! 15 June
|| Observation flights were conducted over the eruption site on 11 and 14 June.  A white plume was observed to be at a height of over {{convert|100|m|ft|abbr=on}}

No tephra fallout or lightning was reported.

Low level seismic tremors and pulses were intermittently observed.  In addition to this, a few small, shallow earthquakes were recorded beneath the Eyjafjallaj<U+00F6>kull summit in the last weeks. Thirteen microearthquakes were recorded in the [[M<U+00FD>rdalsj<U+00F6>kull]] caldera from 11 to 14 June, most of which were at a shallow depth.

The seismic activity beneath M<U+00FD>rdalsj<U+00F6>kull glacier does not appear to be related to inflation of the area observed by the GPS monitoring stations. No significant vertical deformation was observed at GPS stations at or around the glacier. However, a station at the northeastern caldera rim (AUST), moved inwards (south-west) towards the caldera by about three centimeters between 9 and 13 June.

A wall of ice has formed along the eastern, southern and western sides of the crater lake. On the northern side, a tephra wall rises some {{convert|20|m|ft}} above the water. The ice walls at the south-western corner of the crater are melting at the site of the vent that was active between 4<U+2013>6 June. The rate of melting is estimated to be about {{convert|1|m3|ft3}} per second.

The level of water in the crater lake rose between {{convert|1|<U+2013>|2|m|ft}} on the weekend of 12<U+2013>13 June. The rate at which the crater lake fills depends on the how fast the surrounding ice melts.  Therefore, several days or even weeks are likely to pass before the crater has filled up.  This could extend to months if the melting slows down.

The water level in the crater will be monitored regularly as its volume is now estimated to be approaching {{convert|500000|m3|yd3}}. If the water level rises a further {{convert|20|m|ft}} and then escapes, an estimated {{convert|3000000|m3|yd3}} of water will flood northwards down the G<U+00ED>gj<U+00F6>kull valley glacier at an estimated rate of {{convert|1500|-|2000|m3|yd3}} per second.<ref>http://www2.hi.is/solofile/1016033</ref>

|- valign="top"
! 23 June
|| Since the last report, there has been very little activity at the Eyjafjallaj<U+00F6>kull volcano. Small ash clouds are seen occasionally, but they disappear again after some minutes.

Water accumulation in the crater is slow as the surrounding ice is no longer in contact with hot material.

GPS measurements show slight movements towards the mountain except at [[Austmannsbunga]] in [[M<U+00FD>rdalsj<U+00F6>kull]], which shows movement towards the southwest. No obvious explanation has been found for this movement.<ref>http://www.earthice.hi.is/page/ies_Eyjafjallajokull_eruption</ref>

== Volume of erupted material and magma discharge ==
The Institute of Earth Sciences<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.earthice.hi.is/ |title=Institute of Earth Sciences |publisher=Earthice.hi.is |date= |accessdate=2010-06-21}}</ref> made a preliminary estimate of erupted material in the first three days of the eruption on 14&nbsp;April 2010 at [[Eyjafjallaj<U+00F6>kull]]. The erupted products are fragmented material, the majority fine-grained airborne [[tephra]]. Eruptive products can be split into three categories along with preliminary estimated erupted volumes:
# Material (tephra) in the ice cauldrons around the volcanic vents: {{convert|30|e6m3|cuyd}}
# Tephra filling the glacial lagoon of G<U+00ED>gj<U+00F6>kulsl<U+00F3>n, carried by floods down the outlet [[glacier]] G<U+00ED>gj<U+00F6>kull: {{convert|10|e6m3|cuyd}}
# Airborne tephra that has been carried to the east and south of the volcano. Uncompacted tephra fallout from eruption plume: {{convert|100|e6m3|cuyd}}
Total: {{convert|140|e6m3|cuyd}} which corresponds to some {{convert|70|<U+2013>|80|e6m3|cuyd}} of [[magma]]. The magma discharge rate is about {{convert|300|m3/s}} or 750&nbsp;t/s.
This is 10<U+2013>20&nbsp;times the average discharge rate in the preceding flank eruption at Fimmv<U+00F6>r<U+00F0>uh<U+00E1>ls.(First Eruption on 20&nbsp;March 2010).<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.earthice.hi.is/page/ies_Eyjafjallajokull_eruption?79,61 |title=Eruption in Eyjafjallaj<U+00F6>kull |publisher=Earthice.hi.is |date= |accessdate=2010-04-21}}</ref>

The IES updated the eruption flow rate on 21 April 2010 to estimation of less than {{convert|30|m3/s}} of magma, or 75&nbsp;tonnes/s, with a large uncertainty. IES also noted that the eruption continue with less explosive activity.<ref name="earthice.hi.is"/>

[[Sulfate aerosols]] that reach the [[stratosphere]] catalyze the production of [[chlorine monoxide]] (ClO), which destroys [[ozone]] (O<sub>3</sub>). In the upper troposphere, the same aerosols become nuclei for cirrus clouds, which increase the Earth's [[albedo]] and thus alter its radiation balance.<ref name="autogenerated1">[http://volcanoes.usgs.gov/Hazards/What/VolGas/volgas.html "Volcanic Gases and Their Effects"] (HTML).

== Comparison to other recent eruptions ==
The recent eruptions of [[Eyjafjallaj<U+00F6>kull]] and the largest [[Volcanic ash|ash]] plume associated with the second eruption phase were not unparalleled in either volume or abundance; however, the location was the critical factor because it affected air travel across [[Europe]]. Neither phase of the eruption was unusually powerful.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://antwrp.gsfc.nasa.gov/apod/ap100419.html |title=APOD: 2010 April 19&nbsp;<U+2013> Ash and Lightning Above an Icelandic Volcano |publisher=Antwrp.gsfc.nasa.gov |date= |accessdate=2010-04-21}}</ref>
Other notable volcanic eruptions in recent years include the eruption of [[Mount Pinatubo]] of 1991 of VEI&nbsp;6.<ref name="smithsonianmag.com"/> This eruption lasted 8&nbsp;days, from 7&nbsp;<U+2013>&nbsp;15&nbsp;June of that year, with an ash cloud that would have required additional days to dissipate,<ref name="PinatuboComparison">

According to the SI / USGS Weekly Volcanic Activity Report<ref name=WVAR>{{cite web | title=SI / USGS Weekly Volcanic Activity Report |url= http://www.volcano.si.edu/reports/usgs/ |publisher=[[Smithsonian Institution]]|work=[[Global Volcanism Program]] and [[US Geological Survey]] }}</ref> (14<U+2013>20&nbsp;April 2010) by the Smithsonian's [[Global Volcanism Program]], the second eruption phase at Eyjafjallaj<U+00F6>kull coincided with eruptions at a number of other volcanoes, including new activity at:
#[[Barren Island (Andaman Islands)|Barren Island]], [[Andaman islands|Andaman]], [[India]] plume rose to an altitude of {{convert|2.4|km|ft}} and drifting {{convert|55|km}} to the north on 19&nbsp;April 2010.
# [[Gaua]], [[Banks Islands]], [[Pacific South West|SW Pacific]], [[Vanuatu]] ash plumes reported from during 13<U+2013>16 and 19<U+2013>21&nbsp;April 2010. The plumes regularly rose to altitudes of {{convert|3|km|ft}}. A spokesman for the Vanuatu Disaster Management Office described the activity as "huge, dark plumes" in an AAP news report.
