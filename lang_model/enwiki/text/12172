The '''Russia-Belarus energy dispute''' began when [[Russia|Russian]] [[state-owned]] [[natural gas|gas]] supplier [[Gazprom]] demanded an increase in gas prices paid by [[Belarus]]. It escalated on [[January 8]], [[2007]], when the Russian state-owned pipeline company [[Transneft]] stopped pumping [[petroleum|oil]] into the [[Druzhba pipeline]] which runs through [[Belarus]].<ref>{{cite news

==Background==
[[Image:Oil pipelines in Europe.png|thumb|300px|Oil pipelines in Europe and Northwestern Asia.]]
Belarus used to pay Russia extremely low prices, which was seen as part of integrational efforts of both countries. In 2006 Belarus paid only $46 per 1000 m<U+00B3>, compared to $290 paid by Germany. The annual Russian subsidies to the Belarusian economy were around $4 billion, as Russian president [[Vladimir Putin]] said on January 9, 2007. In 2006 Russia announced a higher price for 2007. After [[Alexander Lukashenko]]'s (current president of Belarus) refusal and lack of a new treaty Gazprom threatened to cut gas supplies to [[Belarus]] from 10:00 [[Moscow Time|MSK]] on [[January 1]], [[2007]]. Both sides finally agreed on the following terms:
*Russian gas is being sold to Belarus for $100 after Gazprom reduced its claims from $200.
*Belarus sells Gazprom 50% of its national gas supplier [[Beltransgaz]] for the maximal price of $2.5 billion.<ref>{{cite news

*Gas prices for Belarus will gradually rise to European market-price level by 2011.
*Russia's transit fees for gas increase by around 70%.<ref>{{cite news

Another part of the energy dispute is the dispute for oil. In [[1995]], Russia and Belarus agreed that Russia would not impose any customs on oil exported to Belarus. In exchange, the revenues from this oil processed in Belarus would be shared by 15% for Belarus and 85% for Russia. In 2001, Belarus canceled this agreement without Russia to stop its duty-free export. Lukashenko's state kept all the revenues, and many Russian oil companies moved their processing capacities to Belarus. On this occasion, Russia also lost billions of dollars annually. On December 18, 2006, Russia put an end to this practice, announcing a standard $180 toll on Russian export oil to Belarus. In response, Belarus imposed a tariff of US$45 per ton of [[petroleum|oil]] flowing through the Druzhba pipeline, prompting Russia to claim that the move was illegal and to threaten retaliation,<ref>{{cite news

Russia rejected paying the newly imposed Belorussian tariffs.<ref name="oilrow">{{cite web |title=Russia oil row hits Europe supply |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/6240473.stm |publisher=''[[BBC]]'' |accessdate=2006-01-10 |date=[[2006]]-[[01-08]]}}</ref>

In compensation, Belarus began siphoning off oil from the pipeline.<ref name="oilrow" /> According to [[Semyon Vainshtok]], the head of Russia's pipeline monopoly [[Transneft]], Belarus had siphoned off 79,900 metric tons of oil since Saturday. Vainshtok said this was illegal and the move was made "without warning anyone."<ref name="heraldtribune">{{cite news

The situation is reminiscent of other recent price tensions between Russia, one of the world's [[energy superpower]]s, and other states since the start of 2005. These have resulted in increases in the prices paid for gas by [[Moldova]] (now paying US$110 per 1,000 cubic metres<ref>{{cite news

On [[29 July]] [[2006]] Russia shut down oil export to [[Ma<U+017E>eiki<U+0173> Nafta|Ma<U+017E>eiki<U+0173> oil refinery]] in [[Lithuania]] after an oil spill on the Druzhba pipeline system occurred in Russia<U+2019>s [[Bryansk Oblast|Bryansk oblast]], near the point where a line to Belarus and Lithuania branches off the main export pipeline. Transneft said it would need one year and nine months to replace the damaged section. Although Russia cited technical reasons for stopping oil deliveries to Lithuania, Lithuania claims that oil supply was stop because Lithuania sold Ma<U+017E>eiki<U+0173> refinery to Polish company [[PKN Orlen]].<ref>[http://www.jamestown.org/publications_details.php?volume_id=414&issue_id=3822&article_id=2371343 Russian oil supplies to Lithuania cut off], by Vladimis Socor, Eurasia Daily Monitor Volume 3, Issue 150 (August 03, 2006)</ref>

==Impact==
European refineries are required by the [[IEA]] to hold 90 day reserves of oil, so, unlike the gas dispute with Ukraine in 2006, consumers are unlikely to be affected. Poland had an 80-day oil reserve.<ref name="oilrow" /> The Czech Republic is reported to have already started drawing on its 100 day reserves.<ref>{{cite news

The involved countries have, however, expressed concerns about the reliability of Russia as an oil supplier. 

The events have also provoked renewed discussion on the government policy of phasing out [[nuclear power in Germany]].<ref>{{cite news

The [[European Union]] has demanded an "urgent and detailed" explanation, according to a spokesman for Energy Commissioner [[Andris Piebalgs]].<ref name="upstream russianoil"/>

[[Piotr Naimski]], [[Poland]]'s deputy economics minister who is responsible for energy security, stated "This shows once again that arguments among various countries of the former Soviet Union between suppliers and transit countries mean that these deliveries are unreliable from our perspective."<ref name="heraldtribune"/>

German Economy Minister [[Michael Glos]] stated that the dispute showed that "one-side dependencies must not be allowed to develop."<ref>{{cite news

Following a meeting with [[European Commission]] President [[Jos<U+00E9> Manuel Barroso]] in [[Berlin]], German Chancellor [[Angela Merkel]] condemned the action, stating "It is not acceptable when there are no consultations about such actions". Commenting on the importance of trust in energy security, she said "That always destroys trust and no trusting, undisturbed cooperation can be built on that." Merkel continued by saying "We will certainly say to our Russian partners but also to Belarus that such consultations are the minimum when there are problems, and I think that that must become normality, as it would be within the European Union." Barroso said that "while there is no immediate risk to supplies, it is not acceptable" for such actions to be undertaken without prior consultation.<ref>{{cite news
