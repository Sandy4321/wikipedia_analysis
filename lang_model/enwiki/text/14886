The '''1st Guard Reserve Division''' (''1. Garde-Reserve-Division'') was a reserve infantry division of the [[German Army (German Empire)|Imperial German Army]] in [[World War I]].  It was a reserve formation of the Prussian Guards, the elite regiments raised throughout the [[Kingdom of Prussia]]. It was formed on mobilization in August 1914 and dissolved in 1919 during the demobilization of the German Army after the Armistice.<ref>[http://www.1914-18.info/erster-weltkrieg.php?u=359  1. Garde-Reserve-Division]</ref> 

The division saw action on both the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western]] and [[Eastern Front (World War I)|Eastern]] Fronts during World War I.  It was not heavily engaged in the war's major well-known battles, but was rated by Allied intelligence as a dependable division willing to take losses to hold and retake the line.<ref>''Histories of Two Hundred and Fifty-One Divisions of the German Army which Participated in the War (1914-1918), compiled from records of Intelligence section of the General Staff, American Expeditionary Forces, at General Headquarters, Chaumont, France 1919'' (1920), pp.24-25.</ref>

==Order of battle on February&nbsp;23, 1918==
Divisions underwent many changes during the war, with regiments moving from division to division, and some being destroyed and rebuilt.  During the war, most divisions became [[Triangular division|triangular]] - one infantry brigade with three infantry regiments rather than two infantry brigades of two regiments (a "[[square division]]"). An artillery commander replaced the artillery brigade headquarters, the cavalry was further reduced, the engineer contingent was increased, and a divisional signals command was created. The 1st Guard Reserve Division's order of battle on [[February 23]] [[1918]] was as follows:<ref>Cron et al., ''Ruhmeshalle''</ref>
