'''Antonio Paoli''' (April 14, 1871 &ndash; August 24, 1946) was a [[Puerto Rico|Puerto Rican]] [[tenor]]. He was known at the height of his fame as "The King of Tenors and The Tenor of Kings". He is considered to be the first Puerto Rican to reach international fame in the musical arts.  Paoli has been recognized as "one of the most outstanding opera singers of all times", and as one who had "one of the most lyric and powerful voices ... superior even to his contemporary rival, [[Enrico Caruso]]."<ref name="nrhpreg">{{cite web |title=National Register of Historic Places Registration: Casa Paoli |url=http://www.nps.gov/history/nr/feature/weekly_features/CasaPaoli.pdf |format=[[Portable Document Format|PDF]] |date=August 11, 2009 |author=Juan Llanes Santos |publisher=[[National Park Service]] |accessdate=December 4, 2009}} (19 pages, with maps and b&w historic photos and 5 recent color photos).

==Early years==
===His family===
Antonio Emilio Paoli y Marcano was born in the city of [[Ponce, Puerto Rico|Ponce]] on April 14, 1871. He was the seventh of eight brothers and sisters procreated by Domingo Paoli Marcatentti, born in [[Corsican immigration to Puerto Rico|Corsica]], and Amalia Marcano Intriago, who was originally from [[Isla Margarita]] in [[Venezuela]]. The couple met in [[Caracas]] and instantly fell in love, but because of class differences, Amalia's father, a rich landlord, was strongly opposed to the relationship. The young couple, breaking all class protocols and nineteenth century moral codes, escaped without getting married, first to the [[Dominican Republic]] and later to [[Puerto Rico]].<ref>Juan Llanes Santos, Historian, and State Historic Preservation Officer, Certifying Officer.

United States Department of the Interior. National Park Service. (Washington, D.C.)  Page 5. Listing Reference Number 09000769. August 12, 2009.</ref>

In the island by the early 1850s, the couple established themselves in [[Yauco]], but later moved to Ponce. Their first home in the southern city was a sugarcane farm, [[Hacienda Mercedita|Hacienda La Fe]], located on the banks of [[Rio Portugues]]. After having their first five children, Domingo and Amalia got married at the [[Ponce Cathedral]] in 1864. As a wedding gift, Amalia's aunt, Teresa Intriago, presented the couple with a house located at one of the main arteries in [[Ponce Historic Zone|Ponce's urban core]], Calle Mayor (Mayor Street), House #14. Another three children would be born at their new residence, including Antonio Emilio Paoli y Marcano.<ref>Juan Llanes Santos, Historian, and State Historic Preservation Officer, Certifying Officer.

===His house: [[Casa Paoli]]===
The city of Ponce was the ideal place for the initial cultural development of young Antonio Paoli. During the nineteenth century, Ponce became the financial capital of the island. The city attracted a vast foreign population, which brought along their agricultural technical knowledge, investment capital, international commercial links and even, their human property. Through commercial ties and marriage arrangements, the foreign elite became entangled with the local one, composed of Creoles and ''Peninsulares''. The financial strength of the city translated into an impressive urban and cultural development. The city became synonymous of high-class taste and cultural refinement.<ref>Juan Llanes Santos, Historian, and State Historic Preservation Officer, Certifying Officer.

===Teatro La Perla===
By late nineteenth century Ponce enjoyed a full social life boasting local orchestras, with renowned musicians suchas [[Juan Morel Campos]]. These  orchestras performed for the general public in a regular basis, at the [[festival|Carnaval de Ponce|]], the Old Ponce Casino and at weekly music recitals at the "Plaza Las Delicias" Ponce's [[town square]]. One of the most poopular places in which these orchestras played at was the "Teatro La Perla" located a block away from Paoli's residence. Due to its sophisticated population, the city was continually visited by Spanish, Latin American and European performers. The ''Teatro La Perla'' (La Perla Theater) was the mandatory venue for Spanish [[zarzuela]]s, variety shows and opera companies.<ref> Emilio J. Pasarell. ''Origenes y desarrollo de la aficion teatral en Puerto Rico.'' Santurce, Puerto Rico: Editorial del Departamento de Instruccion Publica. 1970.</ref>

In 1879, at La Perla Theater, the young Paoli saw his first opera concert, Giuseppe Verdi's ''Il Trovatore'', performed by the Italian tenor Pietro Baccei, and at that moment knew what he wanted to do as an adult. His parents were very supportive of his ambition and guided him on this route during his youth, enrolling him in a school of "voice" directed by Ramon Marin. <ref name="AP">[http://www.prpop.org/biografias/a_bios/antonio_paoli.shtml PRPOP]</ref> Paoli spent the first twelve years of his life in this culturally-rich environment. But Paoli did not have to leave his residence at #14 Mayor Street to find art: Antonio's ten-year-older sister, Amalia Paoli, demonstrated her soprano's abilities early on her life at her own house, taking private lessons in Ponce and San Juan. And, in 1880, Amalia, when only 19 years old, performed at La Perla in [[Emilio Arrieta]]'s opera, ''Marina''.<ref>Juan Llanes Santos, Historian, and State Historic Preservation Officer, Certifying Officer.

===Move to Europe===
By 1878, the young Antonio had lost both of his parents. Amalia Paoli, although not the oldest, took full responsibility of her little brothers and sisters.<ref>
Antonio Paoli's father, Domingo, dies on March 21, 1876, and his mother Amalia dies 2 years later on October 20, 1878.</ref> In 1883, "with the assistance of well-connected people", Amalia moved to [[Spain]] and was able to get an audition in front of [[Isabella, Princess of Asturias (1851<U+2013>1931)|Isabel de Borbon]], [[Princess of Asturias]], and sister of the [[King of Spain]], [[King Alfonso XII|Alfonso XII]]. Impressed with Amalia's singing abilities, the Princess took Amalia under her protection and sent her to received singing classes under the most famous singing teacher at the time in Madrid, Napoleon Verger. Amalia was also able to get royal assistance for her younger siblings, Rosarito and Antonio Paoli, which moved with her to Spain in 1883.<ref>Juan Llanes Santos, Historian, and State Historic Preservation Officer, Certifying Officer.

==Singing career==
===Training===
[[Image:Amalia Paoli.JPG|left|115px|thumb|Amalia Paoli, Antonio Paoli's beloved sister and [[confidant]]]]
With a scholarship given directly by [[Maria Cristina De Habsburgo-Lorena|Maria Cristina de Habsburgo]], [[Queen of Spain]], Antonio Paoli was admitted to the ''Real Colegio de los Padres Agustinos'' in the [[El Escorial|Escorial Monastery]]. In the monastery's choir, Paoli started to show his impressive voice. After school completion, Antonio entered the Toledo's Military Academy, to follow in his brother Carlos' footsteps as a career soldier. In 1892, Paoli graduated with honors from the academy and was assigned to the Queen's escort, who made him personal custodian and guard of the child [[King Alfonso XIII]]. But his passion for the performing arts finally won.<ref>Juan Llanes Santos, Historian, and State Historic Preservation Officer, Certifying Officer. State Historic Preservation Office (San Juan, Puerto Rico). August 11, 2009. In ''National Register of Historic Places Inventory-Registration Form - Casa Paoli''. United States Department of the Interior. National Park Service. (Washington, D.C.)  Page 6. Listing Reference Number 09000769. August 12, 2009.</ref>

In 1896, with the assistance of the Royal family and his already well-established sister Amalia, Antonio obtained a royal scholarship to attend singing classes in [[Italy]]. Returning to Spain in 1897, Antonio had his official debut as a tenor in [[Valencia, Spain|Valencia]], with the interpretation of Edward of Ravenswood in [[Gaetano Donizetti]]'s ''[[Lucia di Lammermoor|Lucia de Lamermoor]]''. In that very same year, the 26-year-old tenor was invited to [[Milan, Italy]], to sing in a concert in honor of [[Giuseppe Verdi]]. Paoli's interpretation of an [[aria]] from Il Trovatore put the entire opera house on its feet, including Verdi, for a [[standing ovation]].<ref>Juan Llanes Santos, Historian, and State Historic Preservation Officer, Certifying Officer.

===His debut===
In 1898, encouraged by his sister, his singing instructor and even the Royal family, Paoli moved to [[Paris, France]]. He was told that he needed to prove himself out of Spain and Italy, where he was already known. Paris was the opera's Mecca (besides [[Milan]]) and the public was known as one of the most critical and hard to satisfy. After expending rigorous time studying French, Paoli was accepted to sing at the ''[[Palais Garnier]]'' (also known as the ''[[Paris Opera|Academie de la Musique]]'') to interpret the character of Arnold in [[Gioacchino Rossini]]'s ''[[William Tell]]''. Considered one of the most demanding characters in opera, Arnold was a role that scared away some of the greatest tenors, and still does today. Paoli's debut in the [[Op<U+00E9>ra-Comique|Theatre National de L'Opera]] in Paris was on April 26, 1899 and it was tremendous. The debut was in [[Gioacchino Rossini]]'s opera ''[[William Tell (opera)|William Tell]].''<ref name="MOPR">[http://www.musicofpuertorico.com/index.php/artists/antonio_paoli Music of Puerto Rico]</ref> The following day, Paris newspapers commented on Paoli's success: the ''[[Le Temps]]'' exclaimed that "''Thank God...William Tell has his tenor''"; [[Le Figaro]] expressed that "''we should declare Paoli the Tenor of France''"; the headline in Cahiers du Opera read "Antonio Paoli, la Nouvelle Sensation De L'Opera Moderne". Paoli did five more functions in Paris before going in a tour through various cities throughout France.<ref>Jesus M. Lopez. ''Antonio Paoli: El Leon de Ponce.'' Waterbuty, CT: Ediciones Liricas Puertorrique<U+00F1>as, 1997. Page 60.</ref>

While many maintain that Paoli and Caruso were friends, the rivalry was clearly evident in Paris when Paoli was picked over Caruso for appointment to the Paris Opera, due in part to Paoli<U+2019>s high physical stature and stage presence. Paoli quickly learned to speak French and was highly successful in Paris.<ref>[http://www.musicofpuertorico.com/index.php/artists/antonio_paoli Music of Puerto Rico.] Retrieved May 28, 2010.</ref>

===European tour===
Paoli's great talent quickly brought about recognition and acclaim across [[Europe]]. From [[France]], Paoli returned to [[Italy]] to perform at the Teatro Reggio in [[Parma, Italy|Parma]], in front of a public that had a reputation of physically attacking singers whose performances were not up to their standards. On January 25, 1900, Paoli sang the character ''Manrico'' in Verdi's ''[[Il Trovatore]]'', in an interpretation that was described by Verdi himself as "a complete triumph, Paoli is exciting and unique".<ref>Jesus M. Lopez. ''Antonio Paoli: El Leon de Ponce.'' Waterbuty, CT: Ediciones Liricas Puertorrique<U+00F1>as, 1997. Page 66.</ref>

===World tours===
By 1900, Antonio Paoli was ready to take on the world of the performing arts. Paoli<U+2019>s great talent quickly brought him recognition and aclaim across Europe. By 1900, his performances had paved the way for a concert appearance at the prestigeous [[Royal Opera House|Covent Garden]] in [[London]].<ref>[http://www.musicofpuertorico.com/index.php/artists/antonio_paoli Music of Puerto Rico.] Retrieved May 28, 2010.</ref> Between 1900 and 1914 his career sky-rocketed. His "lungs of steel and voice of gold" would take him to the most important opera houses around the world. Paoli became the most acclaimed tenor, and by 1910, was consider the best paid singer in the world.<ref>Juan Llanes Santos, Historian, and State Historic Preservation Officer, Certifying Officer. State Historic Preservation Office (San Juan, Puerto Rico). August 11, 2009. In ''National Register of Historic Places Inventory-Registration Form - Casa Paoli''. United States Department of the Interior. National Park Service. (Washington, D.C.)  Page 7. Listing Reference Number 09000769. August 12, 2009.</ref>  Within those fourteen years, Paoli performed in Europe, America, Africa, and Asia, in one of the most demanding schedules ever accomplished by an opera singer. During 1900, after a brilliant performance in Italy, Paoli entertained crowds in [[Luxemburg]]. Likewise in [[England]], with brilliant performances at [[London]], [[Scotland]], [[Edinburgh]], and [[Brighton]], closing the year with concerts in [[Corsica]] (his father's homeland) and [[Turkey]]. The same year, he married Josephine Vetiska, an Austrian, in Vienna.<ref>[http://www.enciclopediapr.org/ing/article.cfm?ref=09072203 ''Antonio Paoli.'' Encyclopedia Puerto Rico.] Retrieved May 28, 2010.</ref>

In 1901-1902, Paoli performed in [[Havana, Cuba]]; [[Port-au-Prince, Haiti]] and the [[Dominican Republic]]. He visited Puerto Rico in 1901 to celebrate his [[honeymoon]], after almost 20 years of absence, and performed at the San Juan and [[Ponce Cathedral|Ponce's Cathedrals]], the old [[San Jose Church]] and the city of [[Mayaguez, Puerto Rico|Mayaguez]]. From Puerto Rico, Paoli departed to [[Venezuela]] (his mother's homeland), [[Cuba]], [[Central America]], [[Colombia]] and [[Mexico]]. In this last country, Paoli performed in a private session for Mexico's president, [[Porfirio Diaz]].<ref>Juan Llanes Santos, Historian, and State Historic Preservation Officer, Certifying Officer.

He returns to Italy and purchases a [[villa]] in [[Porto Ceresio|Porto Cereso, Lugano, Italy]], where his son Antonio Arnaldo is born. After Arnaldo's birth, Josephine falls ill and becomes bed-ridden for the next 20 years, saddening the tenor considerably.<ref>[http://www.casapaoli.org/antonio_paoli.htm Casa Paoli's Website.] Retrieved May 28, 2010.</ref>

The singer went back to Spain to performed in Cadiz, Malaga and Cordova; later Pamplona and Madrid, where he presented a private concert for the king, Alfonso XII and the Royal family. By 1902, Paoli was back in America to sing in [[New York]], [[Boston]], [[Philadelphia]], [[Albany, New York|Albany]], [[Providence, Rhode Island|Providence]], [[Grand Rapids]], [[New London]], [[Detroit]], [[Cleveland]], [[Indianapolis]], [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]], [[Pittsburg]], [[Syracuse, New York|Syracuse]] and [[Chicago]]. By 1903, the strong performer was in Italy, singing in [[Milan]], [[Bologna]] and [[Venice]], and later moved to [[Austria]], [[Rumania]] and [[Bulgaria]], and then back to Italy and Spain. By the beginning of 1904, Paoli was in [[Portugal]], inaugurating the opera season. In [[Lisbon]], the [[Diva|Divo]] performed eighteen functions of four different operas and a private concert for [[Infante Charles of Portugal|Prince Carlos de Braganza]], ending this year with an exhausting tour of Spain.<ref>Juan Llanes Santos, Historian, and State Historic Preservation Officer, Certifying Officer.

In 1905, Paoli delighted the [[Russians|Russian]]s with his powerful voice with concerts in [[Odessa]], where he performed ''Il Trovatore'' six times in eight days and in the Grand Theatre du Conservatoire in [[St. Petersburg]], concert attended by the [[Russian Czar]], [[Nicholas II]], who invited Paoli to a private concert at the [[Winter Palace]]. The Czar honored Paoli with the title ''Cammer Sanger'' (Chamber Singer) and the Medal of the Saint Maurice Order. The tenor was back in Russia the following year, 1906, to sing in [[Moscow]], [[Kiev]], [[Kharkov]], [[St Petersburg]], and [[Odessa]]. He also performed in [[Valparaiso, Chile]], [[Iquique]], [[Concepcion, Chile]] and [[Santiago, Chile]] in Chile.<ref>Juan Llanes Santos, Historian, and State Historic Preservation Officer, Certifying Officer.

The year of 1907 found Paoli starting his tour in Italy, then Russia and [[Crimea]]. Back to Italy, the tenor performed, on September 5, a private recital for the [[Pope Pius X]] at the [[Sistine Chapel]] in the [[Holy See|Vatican]]. This year was also crucial as, for the first time, a studio attempted to record an opera. Estudios Gramophone in Milan, Italy, put together a team of engineers and musicians to record [[Leoncavallo]]'s ''[[I Pagliacci]]'', with Leoncavallo himself directing and a brilliant cast of performers. Antonio Paoli was selected as the First Tenor in the main character, becoming the first opera artist to record an entire opera and beginning a highly successful career as a recording artist. Because of his powerful voice, it was necessary to arrange the singers and musicians in a particular way during the recording sessions. The recording equipment was placed on front, and then the singers in a semi-arc in front of the gramophone, then the musicians, and, at the end of the recording room, 20 feet away from the gramophone, Paoli stood alone. The tenor's powerful notes were cracking the carbon filters in the recording equipment and the engineers finally figured that twenty-foot was a safe distance for Paoli to sing.<ref>Jesus M. Lopez.

During the following years Paoli's fame and fortune kept increasing. Paoli became the most recognized tenor and the best paid artist in the world. He performed in [[Greece]], [[Palestine]], [[Poland]], [[Egypt]], [[South America]] and his beloved Spain and Italy, where he established his permanent residence. In 1910, the singer was signed as the First Tenor by La Scalia (Milan), the most prestigious opera company in the world at the time. For the next four years, his reputation and performing scheduled reached new heights.<ref>Juan Llanes Santos, Historian, and State Historic Preservation Officer, Certifying Officer.

==Boxing career==
But the strenuous singing agenda of so many years started to take its toll on the man with the "lungs of steel and the voice of gold". In 1914, just before the official beginning of the First World War, the great tenor lost his voice. To make matters worse, the War to end all Wars shut down every single opera house in Europe. Paoli moved to Spain, a neutral country in the conflict, leaving all his properties unattended in Italy. By 1915, the prolific singer, who was also a prolific expender and a bad investor, found himself without economic means.<ref>Juan Llanes Santos, Historian, and State Historic Preservation Officer, Certifying Officer.

Paoli's life took a strange detour. To make a living, the great tenor became a professional boxer. With his voice gone, Paoli used his well-known physical strength and size to become a prize fighter. After a period of training in Spain, Paoli moved to England to start his new "career". The tenor fought five times and actually won all the fights. On his sixth challenge, Antonio broke his right wrist putting an end on his boxing days.<ref>Juan Llanes Santos, Historian, and State Historic Preservation Officer, Certifying Officer.

While Europe was being devastated by the war, Paoli lived an errand life; sold his properties in Italy to get some flowing cash, acquired a small country house in Spain and stayed few months with his brother Carlos in the [[Philippines]]. All comments from the artistic world were pretty much the same: Antonio Paoli's brilliant career was over. But during this very hard period, Paoli was medically treating his vocal cords and slowly, but daily, was conducting singing exercises with his beloved sister, Amalia, who moved to her brother's country house.<ref>Juan Llanes Santos, Historian, and State Historic Preservation Officer, Certifying Officer.

==Return to the stage==
In January 1917, it was announced that the 46-year-old Antonio Paoli was going to perform the opera ''[[Samson and Delilah]]'' at the Constanzi Theater in Rome. Among the many present on the night of January 17, 1917 was the soprano [[Elvira de Hidalgo]], who later became the singing coach of the great [[Maria Callas]]. Hidalgo remembered that:<ref>Juan Llanes Santos, Historian, and State Historic Preservation Officer, Certifying Officer. State Historic Preservation Office (San Juan, Puerto Rico). August 11, 2009.

:"No one suspected that Paoli was coming back to the stage; we all knew that he has lost his voice. People were there to see him fail; I saw some guys with tomatoes and rotten eggs, ready to throw them as soon as Paoli made his first mistake. But when he came out singing his initial aria, the public went crazy and stood-up in a standing ovation. Paoli's voice sounded like one of those trumpets that you expect to hear in the [[last judgment|day of the final judgment]]. His debut was tremendous. He had to repeat twice every single aria that he performed that night, because the public furiously demanded it. He performed for seven consecutives nights with the theater at its maximum capacity. I attended every single function. Every night he sang better than the night before. I always dreamed to sing with Paoli, but I don't think my voice was good or strong enough to sing with him. I think he was the greatest tenor ever."<ref>Jesus M. Lopez. ''Antonio Paoli: El Leon de Ponce.'' Waterbuty, CT: Ediciones Liricas Puertorrique<U+00F1>as, 1997. Page 469.</ref>

In 1929 his wife Josephine passes away. A year later he marries Adelaida Bonini, from [[Rimini, Italy]], and whom he affectionately called "Adina". Adelaida was by his side till his death.<ref>[http://www.casapaoli.org/antonio_paoli.htm Casa Paoli's Web Site.] Retrieved May 28, 2010.</ref>

During the early 1920s, Paoli kept busy performing in Italy, South America and the [[United States]]. He returned to Puerto Rico in 1923. At the time, Amalia Paoli was residing in San Juan (in the ward of Santurce) where she was running a singing school (Academia Paoli). Antonio conducted a few performances around the island and then departed to sing at the [[Brooklyn Academy of Music]], at the [[Manhattan Opera House]] and at the [[Metropolitan Opera House]] in Philadelphia. From the U.S., the tenor would visit [[Curacao]], Cuba, Colombia, Haiti and [[Ecuador]]. But even with this busy agenda, Paoli's financial situation remained strained. After living in New York City for almost the entire year of 1927, Paoli decided to come back to Puerto Rico to live and work with his sister Amalia.<ref>Juan Llanes Santos, Historian, and State Historic Preservation Officer, Certifying Officer.

==Last years==
In 1917, at the height of [[World War One]] in [[Europe]], Paoli retired to Puerto Rico. He had wanted to sing in the [[Metropolitan Opera House (39th St)|Metropolitan Opera House]] in [[New York]], but apparently his competitor [[Enrico Caruso]] opposed this. Some attribute this to the fact that Caruso was a shareholder of the renown opera house.<ref>[http://www.musicofpuertorico.com/index.php/artists/antonio_paoli Music of Puerto Rico.] Retrieved May 28, 2010.</ref> Paoli subsequently lost his fortune (estimated at $2 million) in bad investments and was forced to find alternative means of employment to singing in order to earn an income, even becoming a professional [[boxing|boxer]].<ref name="AP"/>

In 1922, Paoli started giving voice lessons and together with his sister, Amalia, established a school. Paoli helped produce ''[[Othello]]'' at the Municipal Theater in [[San Juan, Puerto Rico|San Juan]].<ref name="MOPR"/>

In late 1927, the great tenor returned to his homeland. For the next two decades Paoli's main concerned would be teaching at the Paoli Academy with Amalia. In 1928, the tenor performed Verdi's ''[[Otello]]'' entirely for the last time in San Juan, Puerto Rico.
This was his last performance on stage. It took place at the San Juan Municipal Theater, known today as the [[Teatro Tapia|Tapia Theater]].<ref>[http://www.enciclopediapr.org/ing/article.cfm?ref=09072203 ''Antonio Paoli.'' Encyclopedia Puerto Rico.] Retrieved May 28, 2010.</ref> In 1935, the government of Puerto Rico named the San Juan Municipal Theater in his honor, changing its name to ''Teatro Paoli.''.<ref>[http://www.musicofpuertorico.com/index.php/artists/antonio_paoli Music of Puerto Rico.] Retrieved May 28, 2010.</ref><ref>[http://www.prpop.org/biografias/a_bios/antonio_paoli.shtml Fundacion Nacional para la Cultura Popular.] Retrieved May 28, 2010.</ref>

The tenor was invited to recitals, radio interviews were he was always asked to sing and he also took part of concerts with his students, but his last years were mostly dedicate to his students. His last singing performance was given in 1942, while commemorating the one-year anniversary of the death of his beloved sister, Amalia Paoli. The service was conducted at the Chapel of the [[University of the Sacred Heart]] (Santurce). Those present commented that Paoli's voice "shook the walls". He was also deeply involved in lobbying for the creation of a [[Puerto Rico Conservatory of Music|Music Conservatory in Puerto Rico]], which was established in 1959. But the tenor did not lived to see this last wish.<ref>Juan Llanes Santos, Historian, and State Historic Preservation Officer, Certifying Officer.
