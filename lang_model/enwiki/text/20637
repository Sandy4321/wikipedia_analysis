The '''Golden White-eye''' ('''''Cleptornis marchei''''') is a species of [[bird]] in the white-eye family [[Zosteropidae]]. It is [[monotype (biology)|monotypic]] within the genus '''''Cleptornis'''''. The species is restricted to the islands of [[Saipan]] and [[Aguijan]] in the [[Northern Mariana Islands]], where it is shares its range with ([[sympatry]]) and competes with the related [[Bridled White-eye]]. This bird has golden coloured [[plumage]] that gives it its name, and a pale eye-ring. It feeds on insects, fruit and nectar and forages in pairs or small family groups. The Golden White-eye is monogamous and lays two eggs in a small cup nest. In spite of its current abundance and the fact that it has the highest recorded densities for any bird, it is nevertheless considered to be [[critically endangered]]. It is threatened by the [[invasive species|invasive]] [[brown tree snake]] which has recently become [[introduced species|established]] to Saipan, and this predator is expected to cause a rapid decline in the population if not controlled.

==Taxonomy==
The species was once called the '''Golden Honeyeater''' as it was considered to be a [[honeyeater]] and placed with the genus ''Plitlois'' by Dr. [[Jean-Fr<U+00E9>d<U+00E9>ric <U+00C9>mile Oustalet]] when he described the species in 1889 (that genus is now considered defunct and is no longer used).<ref name="Yearbook09"> {{cite book| title =Rare Birds Yearbook 2009| publisher =MagDig Media Lmtd| date =2008| location =England| pages =194<U+2013>195| isbn =978-0-9552607-5-9 }}</ref> Behavioural and morphological characteristics caused H.

==Distribution and habitat==
[[File:Northern Mariana Islands-CIA WFB Map.png|thumb|The Golden White-eye is distributed on [[Saipan]] and [[Aguijan]] in the [[Northern Mariana Islands]]]]
The Golden White-eye is [[Endemism|endemic]] to [[Northern Mariana Islands]], where it currently occurs on the islands of [[Saipan]] and [[Aguijan]]. Within its range it occupies a range of [[habitat]]s, both natural and man-made.  It is common in native [[forest]]s, particularly the [[limestone]] forests, but also occurs in open [[shrubland]] and [[suburban area]]s. On Saipan the only habitats it is generally absent from are the grassy [[savanna]]s and the marshes around Lake Susupe.<ref name = "HBW"/>

==Description==
The Golden White-eye differs from the other white-eyes in having large eyes and an outermost [[flight feather#Primaries|primary wing feather]] that is not reduced (as it is in the other species). It is a large white-eye, 14&nbsp;cm (5.5&nbsp;in) long and weighing around 20&nbsp;[[gram|g]] (0.7&nbsp;[[ounce|oz]]).  The species has bright, unmistakable [[plumage]], with: a orange yellow head coupled with a pale eye-ring; a yellow-green back, wings, and tail; and golden orange undersides. Both the bill and legs are orange as well. The plumage of both sexes is similar; the males can be told from the females only when being examined in the hand, since the males have longer wings than the females. The juveniles of this species have similar plumage, though duller than the adults', with brownish patches on the face and neck and brown-yellow streaks on the breast. Juveniles also have dusky bills and dull legs.<ref name = "HBW">{{Citation   | first =  Bas  | last =  van Balen | editor-last = Josep   | editor-first =  del Hoyo   | editor2-last = Andrew   | editor2-first =  Elliott   | editor3-last = David   | editor3-first = Christie   | contribution = Family Zosteropidae (White-eyes)  | title = [[Handbook of the Birds of the World]].

The Golden White-eye makes a variety of [[bird vocalization|calls]]. The song that is a long raspy warble rendered as "''s<U+00E9><U+00E9> m<U+00E9>-can you s<U+00E9><U+00E9> m<U+00E9>-I can s<U+00E9><U+00E9> y<U+00F3><U+00FA>-can you s<U+00E9><U+00E9> m<U+00E9>''". The species also makes rasping shorter calls and whistles when in flocks and in flight. Chicks give plaintive whistles when begging for food from adults.<ref name = "HBW"/>

==Behaviour==
Like other white-eyes, the Golden White-eye is [[Diurnality|diurnal]]. In contrast to the [[Bridled White-eye]], which forages in groups and is not territorial, the Golden White-eye occurs in pairs or small family groups consisting of a breeding pair and fledged young.<ref name = "Craig"/> The Golden White-eye is also [[territory (animal)|territorial]], and pairs will [[bird vocalisation|sing]] throughout the day in response to neighbouring pairs. Groups can become aggressive when they encounter one another. The Golden White-eye is also aggressive towards the smaller Bridled White-eye, chasing it away from food and perches and flying through flocks of them in order to disperse them. While it chases other forest passerines, it is less aggressive towards them, and in fact the [[Rufous Fantail]] seeks out the Golden White-eye, foraging behind it to snatch insects flushed by the latter species. The Golden White-eye is socially dominant over the Bridled White-eyes and Rufous Fantails, but it is subordinate to the [[Micronesian Myzomela]] and is chased by that species. It is also occasionally chased by the fantails if it approaches their nests too closely.<ref name ="Survey"/> 
===Diet and feeding===
[[Image:Golden white-eye.jpg|thumb|Golden White-eye feeding on bananas]]
The Golden White-eye is a generalist, feeding on fruit, berries, and insects.<ref name = "Craig"/> Nectar forms part of the diet, and, along with the [[Micronesian Myzomela]] and the [[Bridled White-eye]], the Golden White-eye is a pollinator of some trees, albeit not one as important as these other species.<ref> {{cite journal|title=A snake in paradise: Disturbance of plant reproduction following extirpation of bird flower-visitors on Guam |journal=Biological Conservation|date=2008|first=Hanne|last=Mortensen|coauthors=Yoko Luise Dupont & Jens M.

Certain tree species are preferred as foraging habitat, for example the common forest tree ''[[Cynometra|Cynometra ramifolia]]'' is the preferred tree and used more frequently than the equally common ''[[Guamia|Guamia mariannae]]''. There is considerable overlap between their foraging range and those of the [[Bridled White-eye]], but the Golden White-eye is more generalised in its diet. They also show some differences in the preferred microhabitat for obtaining insects, for example, feeding in dead leaves and branches, whereas the Bridled White-eye prefers gleaning insects on live leaves.<ref name = "Craig"/>

===Breeding===
Breeding occurs throughout the year on Saipan, where the species' nesting behaviour has been studied.<ref name = "breed"> {{cite journal|title=Nest Sites, Clutch Size and Incubation Behavior in the Golden White-Eye|journal=Journal of Field Ornithology|date=1994|first=Colleen|last=Stinson|coauthors=Derek Stinson|volume=65|issue=1|pages=65<U+2013>69|id= |url=http://elibrary.unm.edu/sora/JFO/v065n01/p0065-p0069.pdf|format=PDF|accessdate=2009-01-20 }}</ref> However, the peak breeding period seems to be from March to July.<ref name="Yearbook09 "/> The species is [[monogamy|monogamous]]. The [[Bird nest|nests]] are simple undecorated cups of [[casuarina]] needles, grasses, and vines. These are placed around 2.9 m (between 1.5&ndash;6.5 m) off the ground in a variety of tree species including ''Casuarina'', ''Guamia'', ''[[Cynometra]]'', ''[[Leucaena]]'' and ''[[Citrus]]''.<ref name = "breed"/>  The nests are predated by other bird species, specifically [[Micronesian Starling]]s and [[Collared Kingfisher]]s.<ref>{{cite journal  | last = Sachtleben  | first = Thalia    | year = 2005| title =  Predation and nest success of forest birds in native and nonnative habitat on Saipan, Mariana Islands].

The typical [[clutch (eggs)|clutch size]] is two eggs, which are pale blueish green  with red or brown splotches that are concentrated around the wider end.<ref name = "breed"/> Both sexes share the [[avian incubation|incubation duties]], with each parent incubating for stints of around 25 minutes before being relieved. This species is extremely territorial around the nest, chasing away other birds, including Brindled White-eyes, Rufous Fantails, and other Golden White-eyes.<ref name="Yearbook09 "/> From laying it takes about two weeks for the eggs to hatch. The hatchlings are [[altricial]], in other words naked and helpless. Both parents share the brooding and feeding duties, and take away [[feces| faecal]] sacks to keep the nest clean. The diet of the chicks is almost exclusively composed of insects and caterpillars. Chicks [[fledge]] around 10&ndash;14 days after hatching.<ref name = "breed"/> After fledging they may remain with their parents in small groups for some time.<ref name = "Craig"> {{cite journal|title=Foraging behavior and microhabitat use of two species of white-eyes (Zosteropidae) on Saipan, Micronesia. |journal=Auk| date=1990|first=Robert|last=Craig| coauthors=|volume=107|issue=3| pages=500<U+2013>505|id= |url=http://elibrary.unm.edu/sora/Auk/v107n03/p0500-p0505.pdf|format=pdf |accessdate=2009-01-20}}</ref>

==Threats and conservation ==
[[Image:GoldenWhiteEye.jpg|thumb|Captive breeding is being attempted in some zoos to safeguard the future of this species.]]
The range of the Golden White-eye has contracted considerably since the arrival of humans in the Mariana Islands. [[Fossil]] bones of this species have been found on the nearby islands of [[Tinian]] and [[Rota (island)|Rota]], and it may once have occurred on [[Guam]] as well.<ref>{{cite book | last = Steadman | first = David | authorlink = David Steadman | coauthors = | title = Extinction and Biogeography in Tropical Pacific Birds | publisher = University of Chicago Press | date = 2006 | location = Chicago | pages = 377 | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = 978-0-226-77142-7 }}</ref>
