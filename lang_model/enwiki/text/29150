==Career==

===Youth and Amateur rugby===

Zana played predominantly club rugby for George-based Progress until 2009,<ref name="Agt spanne spook nog om halfeind-plek">{{cite web | url=http://152.111.1.87/argief/berigte/dieburger/2007/06/22/SK/20/uitswdprogram22.html | title=Agt spanne spook nog om halfeind-plek | publisher=Die Burger | date=22 June 2007 | accessdate=9 June 2014 | language=Afrikaans}}</ref> although he was part of the {{Rut SWD U21}} squad for the 2008 Under-18 Provincial Championship.

===SWD Eagles===

In 2010, Zana was one of ten club players identified by {{Rut SWD Eagles}} Johann Lerm and was included in their squad for the [[2010 Vodacom Cup]] competition.<ref name="Lerm gee klubsterre kans">{{cite web | url=http://152.111.1.87/argief/berigte/dieburger/2010/02/04/KS/24/spt-lerm.html | title=Lerm gee klubsterre kans | publisher=Die Son | date=4 February 2010 | accessdate=9 June 2014 | language=Afrikaans}}</ref> He made his first class debut in the opening match of the SWD Eagles' season, a 13<U+2013>22 home defeat to the {{Rut Free State Cheetahs}},<ref name="Match Breakdown: SWD vs Free State">{{cite web | url=http://www.sarugby.net/matchbreakdown.aspx?id=18833&category=&leagueid=765&homeid=7976&awayid=7977&fullview=true | title=Match Breakdown: SWD vs Free State | work=South African Rugby Union | date=27 February 2010 | accessdate=9 June 2014}}</ref> with Zana contributing eight points with his boot through two penalties and a conversion. He started the first four of the SWD Eagles' fixtures in the competition, scoring 26 points.

His contribution was deemed enough to also warrant his inclusion in the SWD Eagles' squad for the [[2010 Currie Cup First Division]] season.<ref name="Klubspelers wys hulle is reg vir Curriebeker">{{cite web | url=http://152.111.1.87/argief/berigte/dieburger/2010/04/20/KS/21/spt-klubs.html | title=Klubspelers wys hulle is reg vir Curriebeker | publisher=Die Son | date=20 April 2010 | accessdate=9 June 2014 | language=Afrikaans}}</ref> Zana made his [[Currie Cup]] debut in the Eagles' first match of the season, a 33<U+2013>12 victory over the {{Rut Border Bulldogs}}.<ref name="Match Breakdown: SWD vs Border">{{cite web | url=http://www.sarugby.net/matchbreakdown.aspx?id=18860&category=&leagueid=768&homeid=8047&awayid=8043&fullview=true | title=Match Breakdown: SWD vs Border | work=South African Rugby Union | date=23 July 2010 | accessdate=9 June 2014}}</ref> Zana played off the bench for the entire season, making eleven appearances in their twelve matches, as the Eagles finished top of the log during the pool stages. However, Zana was an unused substitute in the final against the {{Rut Eastern Province Kings}}, where his side narrowly lost 16<U+2013>12.<ref name="Match Breakdown: SWD vs Eastern Province Kings">{{cite web | url=http://www.sarugby.net/matchbreakdown.aspx?id=19457&category=&leagueid=768&homeid=8047&awayid=8045&fullview=true | title=Match Breakdown: SWD vs Eastern Province Kings | work=South African Rugby Union | date=15 October 2010 | accessdate=9 June 2014}}</ref> He also played in both legs of the [[2010 Currie Cup First Division#Promotion/Relegation Games|promotion/relegation play-offs]], but could not prevent the SWD Eagles losing 65<U+2013>54 on aggregate over two legs to remain in the First Division.

He once again returned for the [[2011 Vodacom Cup]] season, making six appearances for the SWD Eagles.

===Boland Cavaliers===

In May 2011, Zana moved to the [[Western Cape]] where he joined club side Belhar.<ref name="Barends by Walmer; verruil Suid-Kaap vir die WP">{{cite web | url=http://152.111.1.87/argief/berigte/dieburger/2011/06/07/KS/24/StoryD.html | title=Barends by Walmer; verruil Suid-Kaap vir die WP | publisher=Die Son | date=7 June 2011 | accessdate=9 June 2014 | language=Afrikaans}}</ref> He was subsequently included in the {{Rut Boland Cavaliers}} side for the [[2012 Currie Cup First Division]] season.<ref name="Zana by Boland; n<U+00F3>g vyf aanwinste maak reg vir Kings">{{cite web | url=http://152.111.1.87/argief/berigte/dieburger/2012/06/20/KS/21/spt-boland.html | title=Zana by Boland; n<U+00F3>g vyf aanwinste maak reg vir Kings | publisher=Die Son | date=20 June 2012 | accessdate=9 June 2014 | language=Afrikaans}}</ref> After playing off the bench twice, he then started in ten consecutive matches for the Cavaliers in the run-in of the season, scoring 22 points in the process, but couldn't help them qualify for the semi-finals. He was also included in the Boland Cavaliers [[Rugby sevens|sevens]] side that played at the [[2012 7s Premier League]] in Zana's hometown, George.

Zana missed the [[2013 Vodacom Cup]] competition through a shoulder injury,<ref name="Boland-spens 6 ryker; vyf studente, veteraan op pad na Wellington">{{cite web | url=http://152.111.1.87/argief/berigte/dieburger/2013/05/15/SK/18/kpboland.html | title=Boland-spens 6 ryker; vyf studente, veteraan op pad na Wellington | publisher=Die Burger | date=15 May 2013 | accessdate=9 June 2014}}</ref> but returned for the [[2013 Currie Cup First Division]], where he contributed 65 points in thirteen appearances to finish as the Cavaliers' top points scorer in the competition and ninth overall.<ref name="2013 Currie Cup First Division Points Scorers">{{cite web | url=http://www.sarugby.net/scorers.aspx?categoryid=sarugby/curriecup&leagueid=1304&fullview=true | title=2013 Currie Cup First Division Points Scorers | work=South African Rugby Union | accessdate=8 June 2013}}</ref>

He contributed a further 37 points during the [[2014 Vodacom Cup]] competition and started the [[2014 Currie Cup qualification]] tournament with a bang, as he scored 20 points (which included two tries) in their opening day defeat to the {{Rut Griffons}} in [[Welkom]].<ref name="Match Breakdown: Down Touch Griffons vs Boland">{{cite web | url=http://www.sarugby.net/matchbreakdown.aspx?id=119424&category=&leagueid=1774&homeid=18044&awayid=18054&fullview=true | title=Match Breakdown: Down Touch Griffons vs Boland | work=South African Rugby Union | date=7 June 2014 | accessdate=9 June 2014}}</ref>
