==Plot==
The protagonist and narrator is Dexter King (Goldblum), an American actor working in [[London]] and living platonically in [[Camden Town]] with his "educated, charming...nymphomaniac" landlady (played by Geraldine James).  He's just finished his sixth year playing "The Tall Guy", a [[straight man (double act)|straight man]] in a two-man, long-running comedy [[revue]] starring (and dominated by) Ron Anderson (played by Rowan Atkinson).

Chronic [[hay fever]] prompt him to see a doctor, where he meets and falls quickly in love with Kate (played by Emma Thompson), who works there as a [[nurse]].

Soon after meeting Kate, Dexter is fired by Ron.  After being rejected for a role in a new [[Steven Berkoff]] play for "lacking anger", Dexter wins the title role in a new [[Royal Shakespeare Company]] [[musical theater|musical]] based on ''[[The Elephant Man (play)|The Elephant Man]]''.  It's a "nasty send-up of [[Andrew Lloyd Webber]]"<ref name="guard"/> called ''Elephant!'' which features a song called <U+201C>He<U+2019>s Packing His Trunk<U+201D> and a finale which ends with the lyric "Somewhere up in heaven there's an angel with big ears!"

Durring rehearsal, Dexter succumbs to the advances of a married co-star (played by Kim Thomson). On the new musical's opening night, Kate puts together evidence of the affair from a few subtle clues, and leaves Dexter without further ado.

After seeing a scene in a televised award show that suggests Ron is now dating Kate, Dexter impulsively gives up his role in ''Elephant!'' just before the curtain rises, with plans to make an impassioned plea to Kate to take him back. With Ron's involuntary help (Dexter ties him up in his dressing room and steals his car), Dexter presents his case to Kate in a busy hospital ward. Kate agrees to give him another chance.

==Critical reception==
''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' gave it a [[Letter grade|"B-"]], describing it as "mildly charming and mostly too broad" and accusing it of overplaying "Dexter's dorkiness in the same way it overplays the big sex scene, the romantic montage, the breakup scene<U+2026>"<ref>[http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,318262,00.html The Tall Guy], a 1990 review by ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]''</ref>

[[Caryn James]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' wrote "even when its bright theatrical satire gives way to men dressed as nuns dancing in wimples and red sequined shorts, this modest comedy is always wickedly endearing, thanks to the off-kilter characters played by Mr. Goldblum and Emma Thompson as the unlikely woman of his dreams."<ref>[http://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9C0CE2DD1E31F932A1575AC0A966958260 Nuns! Elephants! Must the Show Go On?], a 1990 review by ''[[The New York Times]]''</ref>

In a 2003 mid-career retrospective about Richard Curtis, ''[[The Guardian]]'' described the film as being "patronised in one sense by critics while not patronised in the other by audiences."<ref name="guard"/>.  It also identified several [[Trope (literature)|tropes]] from ''The Tall Guy'' that would be utilized in his subsequent romantic comedies, (''[[Four Weddings and a Funeral]]'', ''[[Notting Hill (film)|Notting Hill]]'' and ''[[Love Actually|Love Actually]]''):<ref name="guard"/>
*romantic lightning strikes that "Curtis seems to believe in as much as any figure in history apart from [[Cupid]]";
*the "willingness to sacrifice realism to a gag" (e.g. turning cartwheels in front of a giant moon to show that Dexter is in love);
*the "wacky but wise" flatmate;
*the use of eccentric obscenities (e.g. Ron's question "What in the name of arse is going on?").

==Alternate versions==
There are significant differences between the American release of the film and the original version, including cut or replaced scenes and overdubbing of British slang and popular culture references.  For example, in the scene featuring [[John Inman]] reading the nominees for the theatre awards, three American actors are named in addition to Ron Anderson, rather than the British actors named in the original.{{fact|date=May 2008}}

As of March 2007, the original version has not been released on DVD or video in the United States.
