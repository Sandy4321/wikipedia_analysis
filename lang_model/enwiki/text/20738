'''Keith Jarrett''' (born 18 May 1948 in [[Newport]], [[Monmouthshire (historic)|Monmouthshire]])<ref>[http://www.blackandambers.co.uk/Personnel.aspx?pr=106731 Newport RFC player profiles]</ref> was a [[Welsh (people)|Welsh]] international [[rugby football|rugby]] centre who played [[rugby union|union]] for [[Newport RFC|Newport]] and [[rugby league|league]] with [[Barrow Raiders|Barrow]]. Jarrett is most notable for his early appearances for the [[Wales national rugby union team]] where he set point scoring records. Jarrett switched to rugby league in 1969 but illness forced him to retire in 1973 at the age of 25. 

== Early career ==
Jarrett is the son of former [[Glamorgan]] cricketer [[Harold Jarrett]] and attended [[Monmouth School]]. Like his father he also played cricket for [[Glamorgan County Cricket Club]]. In 1966 Keith Jarrett played rugby union for Newport against [[Ebbw Vale RFC|Ebbw Vale]], shortly after leaving school.

== International career ==
Jarrett played his first international for Wales on April 15, 1967, against England, still aged only eighteen. In that match he scored a try breaking from his own 22 metre line and running most of the length of the pitch. He also converted the try from just inside the touchline. That try has been voted seventh in a poll of the top ten Welsh tries.  In the same match, he totalled two penalty goals and five conversions.  His performance on the field was so impressive that he made the cover of ''[[Rugby World]]'' magazine two months later.

Jarrett played for Wales at rugby union ten times in all, making his final appearance against [[Australia national rugby union team|Australia]].  In 1968 he set a club record of 30 points for Newport against [[Penarth RFC|Penarth]] and was selected for the [[1968 British Lions tour to South Africa]].  

In 1969 Jarrett transferred to rugby league club Barrow, and also went on to play for the [[Wales national rugby league team|Welsh national rugby league side]].

== Later life ==

Jarrett's career was cut short in 1973, aged just 25, when he suffered a [[stroke]] resulting from a hemorrhage. He was unable to achieve his fullest potential. At 25 he was about to come into his prime and he was unable to achieve his fullest potential.

He was also great friends with Chris "the Cat" Morgan a Welsh centre half and cricket captain of Wales, who was the first man ever to be caught and bowled and hit wicket in the same match in 1978 against the Thessalonians in [[Cairo]] in the aid of Jarrett's testimonal.
