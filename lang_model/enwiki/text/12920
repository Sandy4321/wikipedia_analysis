'''Gennady Ivanovich Yanayev''' ({{lang-ru|<U+0413><U+0435><U+043D><U+043D><U+0430><U+0301><U+0434><U+0438><U+0439> <U+0418><U+0432><U+0430><U+0301><U+043D><U+043E><U+0432><U+0438><U+0447> <U+042F><U+043D><U+0430><U+0301><U+0435><U+0432>}}; 26 August 1937 &ndash; 24 September 2010) was a [[Soviet people|Soviet]] [[Russian people|Russian]] politician and statesman during the [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] years, but also held lower posts during the rules of [[Nikita Khrushchev]], [[Leonid Brezhnev]], [[Yuri Andropov]] and [[Konstantin Chernenko]]. Yanayev was born during the height of [[Stalinist]] repression. After years in local politics, he worked himself up to become a Deputy Chairman of the [[All-Union Central Council of Trade Unions]], but held other less prominent posts such as deputy of the [[Union of Soviet Societies for Friendship and Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries]].

Yanayev was elected to the [[politburo]] and the [[central committee]] in 1990 during the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union]]'s July plenum. Later in December he was made [[Vice President of the Soviet Union]]. He joined and became a leading figure in the [[Gang of Eight (Soviet Union)|State Committee of the State of Emergency]], a group which deposed Gorbachev and led the [[August Coup of 1991]]. The [[coup d'<U+00E9>tat]] collapsed three days after it formed, due to the popularity of [[Boris Yeltsin]]. During the coup's grip on power, he was made Acting [[President of the Soviet Union]]. He was arrested and [[Pardon|reprieved]] in 1994 by the [[State Duma]]. He spent the rest of his life working in the Russian tourism sector. Yanayev died on 24 September 2010.

==Life and career==
Yanayev was born on 26 August 1937 during the height of [[Stalinist]] repression in the Soviet Union.<ref name="born"/> He graduated from the [[Gorky Institute of Agriculture]] in 1959. He worked as the head of mechanized agricultural unit and later as a chief engineer in the [[Nizhny Novgorod|Gorky oblast]].

==Vice Presidency and the August Coup==
{{seealso|1991 Soviet coup d'<U+00E9>tat attempt|Gang of Eight (Soviet Union)}}
On 27 December 1990, [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] campaigned for Yanayev for the Vice Presidency in the [[Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union]]. Yanayev had initially been rejected by the Soviet parliament, but was finally approved thanks to Gorbachev. Yanayev was seen as [[conservative]] nonentity in top circles of the Soviet politics.<ref>{{cite book | author = [[Raymond L. Garthoff|Garthoff, Raymond  L.]] | title = The great transition: American-Soviet relations and the end of the Cold War | publisher = [[Brookings Institution Press]] | year = 1994 | location = | pages = 442 | url = http://books.google.com/books?id=yp01AUkrE-gC&dq | isbn = 0815730608 }}</ref> During Gorbachev's vacation in the [[Crimea]] in the middle of August 1991, the [[State Committee of the State of Emergency]] placed him under [[house arrest]]. On 19 August, following the orders of the Emergency committeee, [[TASS]] released a [[decree]] stating; "Owing to the conditions of his health, Mikhail Gorbachev is no longer capable to carrying on the duties of the [[President of the USSR]]. In Accordance with article 127, clause 7 of the [[1977 Soviet constitution|USSR Constitution]], Vice President Gennady Yanayev has assumed the duties of the president of the USSR". The decree made many references to the growing problems in the country, such as ethnic tension, political confrontations and chaos, which according to them, threatened the very excistence of [[Soviet society|Soviet life]] and the territorial integrity of the USSR.<ref>{{cite book | author = Neimanis, George J. | title = The collapse of the Soviet Empire: a view from Riga | publisher = [[Greenwood Publishing Group]] | year = 1997 | location = | pages = 76 | url = http://books.google.com/books?id=nlLSpT9J_yMC&dq | isbn = 0275957136 }}</ref> It should be noted, that in an interview done in 2008, Yanayev denied playing a critical role in coup, saying he was pressured by the more conservative members to sign the documents which declared his declaring his presidency. In the interview, he said; "These events weigh on my heart to this day".<ref name="born"/>

In the afternoon the citizens of Moscow began to gather around the White House and to erect barricades around it. In response Yanayev declared the state of emergency in Moscow at 16:00.<ref name="two">{{cite news | author = | url = http://www.nr2.ru/projects/79717.html | title = <U+0422><U+043E><U+043D><U+043D><U+0435><U+043B><U+044C> <U+043D><U+0430> <U+043A><U+0440><U+043E><U+0432><U+0438> | language = Russian | publisher = nr2.ru | date = 18 August 2006 | accessdate = 25 September 2010 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news | author = | url = http://souz.info/library/other/gkchp/gkchppost.htm#post1 | title = <U+0413><U+043E><U+0441><U+0443><U+0434><U+0430><U+0440><U+0441><U+0442><U+0432><U+0435><U+043D><U+043D><U+044B><U+0439> <U+043A><U+043E><U+043C><U+0438><U+0442><U+0435><U+0442> <U+043F><U+043E> <U+0447><U+0440><U+0435><U+0437><U+0432><U+044B><U+0447><U+0430><U+0439><U+043D><U+043E><U+043C><U+0443> <U+043F><U+043E><U+043B><U+043E><U+0436><U+0435><U+043D><U+0438><U+044E> <U+0432> <U+0421><U+0421><U+0421><U+0420> | language = Russian | publisher = souz.info | date = | accessdate = 25 September 2010 }}</ref> Yanayev declared at the press conference at 17:00 that Gorbachev was "resting". He said: "Over these years he has got very tired and needs some time to get his health back." Yanayev said GKChP was committed to continuing the reforms. However, his weak posturing, trembling hands and shaky expressions made his words unconvincing.<ref name="two"/>

According to historians, Yanayev was the most visible and powerful member of the Emergency Committee, but [[Vladimir Kryuchkov]], chairman of the [[KGB]], was the "heart and soul of the conspiracy". This can be confirmed by the fact that Yanayev agreed to head the Emergency Committee on the second day of the coup. Even so, Yanayev was dismissed as Vice President and later [[jailed]] for his crimes against the [[Soviet state]].<ref>{{cite news | author = | url = http://www.nr2.ru/moskow/301845.html | title = <U+0423><U+043C><U+0435><U+0440> <U+043B><U+0438><U+0434><U+0435><U+0440> <U+0413><U+041A><U+0427><U+041F> <U+0413><U+0435><U+043D><U+043D><U+0430><U+0434><U+0438><U+0439> <U+042F><U+043D><U+0430><U+0435><U+0432> | language = Russian | publisher = nr2.ru | date = 24 September 2010 | language = Russian | accessdate = 25 September 2010 }}</ref>

==Later life and death==
Three years after the [[collapse of the Soviet Union]], Yanayev was freed by the amnesty of the Russian [[State Duma]] in 1994. He ended up becoming the head of the Department of History and International Relations of the Russian International Academy of Tourism.<ref name="born">{{cite news | author = Schwirz, Michael | url = http://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/25/world/europe/25yanayev.html | title = Gennadi I.

Doctors diagnosed him with [[lung cancer]]. When interviewed during his stay, Yanayev said "The disease literally eats up the lungs". His doctors eventually reached the conclusion that [[chemotherapy]] would be the right course to save his life, but also the most difficult one. They did acknowledge that he was in poor health, and there were little guarantee for his survival. He died on 24 September 2010.<ref>{{cite news | author = | url = http://echo.msk.ru/news/712951-echo.html | title = <U+041E><U+0434><U+0438><U+043D> <U+0438><U+0437> <U+0438><U+0434><U+0435><U+043E><U+043B><U+043E><U+0433><U+043E><U+0432> <U+0413><U+041A><U+0427><U+041F> <U+0413><U+0435><U+043D><U+043D><U+0430><U+0434><U+0438><U+0439> <U+042F><U+043D><U+0430><U+0435><U+0432> <U+0441><U+043A><U+043E><U+043D><U+0447><U+0430><U+043B><U+0441><U+044F> <U+0432> <U+043C><U+043E><U+0441><U+043A><U+043E><U+0432><U+0441><U+043A><U+043E><U+0439> <U+0431><U+043E><U+043B><U+044C><U+043D><U+0438><U+0446><U+0435> | language = Russian | publisher = echo.msk.ru | date = 24 September 2010 | accessdate = 25 September 2010 }}</ref>
