'''Denard Xavier Robinson''' (born September 22, 1990), nicknamed '''Shoelace''', is an [[American football]] player for the [[Jacksonville Jaguars]]. He was the starting [[quarterback]] in all 26 games for the [[2010 Michigan Wolverines football team|2010]] and [[2011 Michigan Wolverines football team]]s and played at the same position as a senior for the [[2012 Michigan Wolverines football team|2012 team]] as well as running back and receiver towards the end of the season.  

As a sophomore in 2010, Robinson set the single-season [[Division I (NCAA)#Football Bowl Subdivision|Division I FBS]] record for [[Rush (American football)|rush]]ing yards by a quarterback and became the only player in [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] history to both [[Forward pass|pass]] and rush for 1,500 yards.  Robinson also broke the [[Big Ten Conference]] season record with 4,272 yards of [[total offense]] (2,570 yards passing and 1,702 yards rushing) and led the conference in rushing.  In his second start at quarterback against [[2010 Notre Dame Fighting Irish football team|Notre Dame]], he set the Michigan single-game record with 502 yards of total offense.  He was awarded the 2010 [[Chicago Tribune Silver Football]] as the Most Valuable Player in the Big Ten Conference and was selected by the [[Football Writers Association of America]] as a first-team [[2010 College Football All-America Team|All-American]].  He also set the Big Ten single-game record for rushing yards by a quarterback and became the only player in NCAA Division I FBS history to both pass for 200 yards and rush for 200 yards in a regular season game twice. 

As a junior in 2011, Robinson led a resurgent Michigan team to an 11<U+2013>2 record and a victory over [[2011 Virginia Tech Hokies football team|Virginia Tech]] in the [[2012 Sugar Bowl]].  He threw for a career-high 338 passing yards in a come-from-behind victory over [[2011 Notre Dame Fighting Irish football team|Notre Dame]] in the first night game played at [[Michigan Stadium]].  At the end of the 2011 season, Robinson had eight of the top 10 single-game total offense totals in Michigan history, including 948 yards in two games against Notre Dame. His total offense output in 2010 (4,272 yards) and 2011 (3,348 yards) rank as the top two single-season totals in Michigan history. As a senior in 2012, he extended his record with a third game with both 200 yards rushing and 200 yards passing.

Robinson acquired the nickname "Shoelace" because he has played football since age 10 with his shoelaces untied.  As a freshman and sophomore, he also competed as a [[Sprint (running)|sprinter]] for the [[Michigan Wolverines men's track and field|Michigan men's track and field team]].  He has run the [[40-yard dash]] in 4.32 seconds, and he recorded the fastest competition time in 2010 among Michigan's sprinters in the [[60-meter dash]].

==Early life and nickname==
[[File:Denard Robinson (2012-09-15) d.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Shoelace on the sidelines at Michigan Stadium]]
Robinson was born in 1990, the son of Thomas Robinson, Sr., and Dorothea Robinson.<ref name=Story/>  Robinson began playing [[Pee-Wee Football|pee-wee football]] by age 10 and played the game with his shoes untied.  Those who saw him play at Westside Park in Deerfield Beach recall:<blockquote>"Kids would go for his shoes on tackles, and he'd come up to the huddle in just socks.  His coach couldn't stand it at first and neither could his parents. They'd tie wristbands around his shoes. When that didn't work, they tried athletic tape. They even rolled his socks over his shoes. He was a marvel, and he wasn't even finished with the sixth grade."<ref name=Story>{{cite news|author=Ryan Kartje|title=They call him Shoelace: The story of Denard Robinson|newspaper=The Michigan Daily|date=November 4, 2010|accessdate=December 22, 2010|url=http://www.michigandaily.com/content/shoelace-story}}</ref></blockquote>

Robinson continued to play football without tying his shoelaces and became known as "Shoelace."<ref name=Rit>{{Cite news|author=Adam Rittenburg|title=Michigan's Robinson hopes to untie QB race|publisher=[[ESPN.com]]|date=August 23, 2009|url=http://espn.go.com/blog/bigten/post/_/id/2638/michigan-s-robinson-hopes-to-untie-qb-race|accessdate=October 18, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|author=David Brousseau|title=Michigan Gives Nod To Ex-Deerfield QB|newspaper=[[South Florida Sun-Sentinel]]|date=August 24, 2009|url=http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/2009-08-24/sports/0908230130_1_western-michigan-michigan-coach-denard-robinson|accessdate=October 18, 2010}}</ref>  One reporter who visited his family to watch a Michigan game noted, "To everyone in Deerfield Beach <U+2013> everyone but his mother, that is <U+2013> there is no Denard, just Shoelace."<ref name=Story/>  Robinson's high school coach, Art Taylor, explained his rationale for accepting the practice:<blockquote>"After 25 years coaching, if the kid can throw it 90 yards in the air and is accurate and the kid can run as fast as he does ... as long as he feels comfortable, not lacing his shoes, fine with me. The kid's been doing it all his life, why mess with it?"<ref name=DFP4>{{cite news|author=Mark Snyder|title=Denard Robinson's shoelaces gain notice|newspaper=Detroit Free Press|date=September 17, 2010|url=|accessdate=October 18, 2010}}</ref></blockquote>

At the college level, his coaches at the [[University of Michigan]] also accepted Robinson's practice.  After learning that Robinson could run the 100 meters in 10.4 seconds with his shoes untied, Michigan quarterbacks coach Rod Smith called it "the damnedest thing I've ever seen" and added, "Anybody that runs that fast I'm not going to tell him how to tie his shoes."<ref name=Shoelace>{{Cite news|author=Dave Birkett|title=How 'Shoelace' Robinson came to be|publisher=[[AnnArbor.com]]|date=August 23, 2009|url=http://www.annarbor.com/sports/how-shoelace-robinson-came-to-be/|accessdate=October 18, 2010}}</ref>  Robinson wears [[Adidas]] Reggie2 Superfly shoes with [[Velcro]] straps to secure them to his feet.<ref name=DFP4/>

==Deerfield Beach High School==
[[File:Denard Robinson (2012-09-15).jpg|left|175px|thumb|Robinson at Michigan Stadium, Sept. 2012]]
As a ninth grader, Robinson tried out for a spot as a [[defensive back]] for the varsity football team at [[Deerfield Beach High School]] in [[Deerfield Beach, Florida]].  The team's defensive coordinator at the time was former [[Buffalo Bills]] defensive back [[Manny Martin]], who was also Robinson's algebra teacher.  Martin later recalled that he had an experienced defensive backfield, but Robinson "was always in my ear: 'I can do it.'"<ref name=DFP3>{{cite news|author=JoAnn Barnas|title=Michigan's Denard Robinson has been QB to watch since Florida prep days|newspaper=Detroit Free Press|date=September 17, 2010|url=|accessdate=October 18, 2010}}</ref>  Robinson did not win a spot on the varsity team and instead played quarterback for the junior-varsity team as a ninth grader.<ref name=DFP3/>

Robinson became the starting quarterback for the Deerfield Beach varsity team as a sophomore and filled that position for three years from 2006 to 2008.<ref name=DFP3/>  Deerfield Beach head coach Art Taylor recalled, "As soon as he stepped on that field his sophomore year playing varsity, we knew we had something special."<ref name=ASC>{{cite news|author=Angelique S.

In a 2007 state semifinal game played at the [[Orange Bowl]], Robinson led his team to within two points of upsetting [[Miami Northwestern High School|Miami Northwestern]], the top-ranked high school team in the country.  While warming up, Robinson noticed that a Miami Northwestern lineman had taped a photograph of Robinson onto the front of his helmet.  Robinson started laughing and told the player, "You think that scares us?"<ref name=DFP3/>  Robinson had Deerfield ahead in the game, 12<U+2013>7, but Miami Northwestern completed a 99-yard [[touchdown]] drive with 18 seconds left to give them a 14<U+2013>12 win.<ref name=DFP3/>

In October 2008 against [[St. Thomas Aquinas High School (Fort Lauderdale, Florida)|St. Thomas Aquinas High School]], Robinson was responsible for six touchdowns in a single game, [[Forward pass|pass]]ing for 342 yards and five touchdowns and rushing for 54 yards and a touchdown.<ref>{{Cite news|author=Mason Kelley|title=Robinson's 6 TDS Lead Bucks|newspaper=South Florida Sun-Sentinel|date=October 12, 2008|url=http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/sun_sentinel/access/1572002951.html?dids=1572002951:1572002951&FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT&type=current&date=Oct+12,+2008&author=MASON+KELLEY&pub=South+Florida+Sun+-+Sentinel&desc=ROBINSON'S+6+TDS+LEAD+BUCKS&pqatl=google|accessdate=October 18, 2010}}</ref>  As a three-year starter for Deerfield Beach, Robinson totaled nearly 6,000 yards of total offense with 4,784 passing yards (262 for 576 passing) and 1,132 rushing yards (5.2 yards per carry).<ref name=Bio/>

Robinson also competed in track for Deerfield Beach.  In March 2009, he ran the [[100 meters]] sprint in 10.44 seconds,<ref>{{Cite news|title=Deerfield sprinter has huge day|newspaper=The Miami Herald|date=March 29, 2009|url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=MH&s_site=miami&p_multi=MH&p_theme=realcities&p_action=search&p_maxdocs=200&p_topdoc=1&p_text_direct-0=1273C4B02E44C9A0&p_field_direct-0=document_id&p_perpage=10&p_sort=YMD_date:D&s_trackval=GooglePM}}</ref> and finished third in the 100-meter dash at the 2008 Florida 4A Track & Field State Championships.<ref name=Bio/>  He also ran the [[40-yard dash]] in 4.32 seconds.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Denard Robinson Player Bio|publisher=University of Michigan|url=http://www.mgoblue.com/sports/m-track/mtt/robinson_denard00.html|accessdate=October 18, 2010}}</ref>  He was also a member of the 2008 [[Florida High School Athletic Association]] state champion [[4 x 100 metres relay]] team.<ref name=Bio/>

In a 34<U+2013>17 loss to Michigan State in the [[Paul Bunyan Trophy]] game, Robinson completed 17 of 29 passes for 215 passing yards but threw three interceptions.<ref name=Halfway/>  He was also limited to 86 rushing yards on 21 carries.

====Consecutive losses to Wisconsin and Ohio State====
Robinson's shot at the Heisman Trophy was lost with a disappointing performance against [[2010 Purdue Boilermakers football team|Purdue]] and consecutive blowout losses to [[2010 Wisconsin Badgers football team|Wisconsin]] and [[2010 Ohio State Buckeyes football team|Ohio State]].  

In the Purdue game, Robinson turned the ball over four times (two interceptions and two lost fumbles) in heavy rain and gusting wind.<ref>{{cite news|author=Chris Nelson|title=Turnovers plague both Michigan and Purdue on wet day|newspaper=Detroit Free Press|date=November 14, 2010|url=http://www.freep.com/article/20101114/SPORTS06/11140572/Turnovers-plague-both-Michigan-and-Purdue-on-wet-windy-day}}</ref>  Robinson was also held to a season-low 68 rushing yards against Purdue.  

One week later, Michigan suffered a 48<U+2013>28 loss to Wisconsin.

In the final game of the regular season, Michigan lost by a 30-point margin (37<U+2013>7) against Ohio State in [[Michigan<U+2013>Ohio State football rivalry|The Game]].  Robinson failed to register a passing or rushing touchdown for the first time in 2010.  Although he rushed for 105 yards on 18 carries, he was limited to 87 passing yards.  After sustaining two dislocated fingers on his non-throwing hand, Robinson was replaced in the second half by Tate Forcier.<ref>{{cite news|author=Larry Phillips|title=Ohio State stopped prolific Michigan, Robinson at every turn|newspaper=Mansfield NewsJournal|date=November 4, 2010|url=http://www.mansfieldnewsjournal.com/article/20101128/SPORTS/11280338/Ohio-State-stopped-prolific-Michigan-Robinson-at-every-turn|accessdate=December 7, 2010}} {{Dead link|date=April 2012|bot=H3llBot}}</ref>

Following Michigan's season-ending loss in the 2011 Gator Bowl, head coach Rich Rodriguez was fired and replaced by [[Brady Hoke]].

==NCAA College Football 14 Cover Vote==
After Robinson's successful collegiate career, he was voted as the next athlete to be on the cover of [[NCAA Football 14]]. The contest achieved more than 6 million votes making Robinson the first Michigan quarterback to don the cover and third Wolverine overall. He is the first since [[Heisman Trophy]] winner [[Desmond Howard]] in 2006, with the other being [[Charles Woodson]] on the 1999 version of the game.<ref>{{cite web|last=Muma|first=Steven|title=NCAA Football 14 cover vote winner: Denard Robinson beats Ryan Swope|url=http://www.sbnation.com/college-football/2013/3/12/4089074/ncaa-football-14-cover-denard-robinson-ryan-swope|publisher=[[SB Nation]]|accessdate=19 March 2013|date=12 March 2013}}</ref> The voting, which took place on social media websites such as [[Facebook]] and [[Twitter]] opened in mid December 2012, lasted until March 8th of 2013. During this time, the contest had gone through several rounds of voting, until finally being shrunken down to the final two, where Denard faced off against [[Texas A&M]] [[wide receiver]] [[Ryan Swope]]. Robinson lasted through all voting rounds, and outlasted [[Alabama Crimson Tide]] running back [[Eddie Lacy]], and possible [[National Football League]] lottery draft selections [[Jarvis Jones]] of the [[Georgia Bulldogs]] and standout [[Tight End]] [[Tyler Eifert]] of the [[Notre Dame Fighting Irish]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Sherman|first=Roger|title=NCAA Football 14 cover vote: Denard Robinson, Eddie Lacy in final 4|url=http://www.sbnation.com/college-football/2013/2/18/4001598/ea-sports-ncaa-football-14-cover/in/3853065|publisher=[[SB Nation]]|accessdate=22 March 2013|date=18 February 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Sherman|first=Roger|title=NCAA Football 14 cover vote: Eddie Lacy, Denard Robinson among 8 candidates|url=http://www.sbnation.com/college-football/2013/2/1/3940466/ncaa-football-14-cover-vote-ea-sports/in/3853065|publisher=[[SB Nation]]|accessdate=22 March 2013|date=1 February 2013}}</ref>  The contest gained attention worldwide, with former students and athletes vouching support for their former schools. Former [[University of Michigan Swimming]] star and decorated Olympian [[Michael Phelps]] was one of many celebrities to publicly show his support for his former school, as well as rap artist/celebrity [[Snoop Dogg]] showing support for Robinson, who does not have any ties to the University itself.
