"'''Captain Jack'''" is a song by [[Billy Joel]], featured on his 1973 album, ''[[Piano Man (album)|Piano Man]]'', with a live version being placed on his album, ''[[Songs in the Attic]]'', in 1981. Joel originally wrote the song, an anti-drug song, in 1971, while observing some people from his window obtaining drugs from a dealer named "Captain Jack".

Arguably, it is the most important of his early compositions because his performance of the song at a live radio concert on [[WMMR]] in [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|Philadelphia]], and the subsequent airplay it received, brought him to the attention of major record labels, including [[Columbia Records|Columbia]], with which he would sign a recording contract in 1973.

Reception for the song was very positive. The song entered the news again during [[Hillary Clinton]]'s campaign for Senate in [[New York]], when the song was mistakenly played during a rally, instead of "[[New York State of Mind]]".

==Composition==
Joel wrote "Captain Jack" in late 1971,<ref name=Bego67> {{cite book |last=Bego |first=Mark |title=Billy Joel: The Biography |year=2007 |publisher=Thunder's Mouth Press |location=New York |isbn=978-1-56025-989-3 |page=67}}</ref><ref name=Attic>{{cite album-notes |title=[[Songs in the Attic]] |bandname=Billy Joel |year=1981 |first=Billy |last=Joel |format=LP|publisher=Columbia Records |publisherid=TC 37461 |location=New York}}</ref> while sitting in his apartment in [[Oyster Bay (hamlet), New York|Oyster Bay]], [[Long Island]], looking out the window, trying to find inspiration for a song. Across the street was a housing project, and he observed suburban teenagers going into the project and scoring [[heroin]] from a dealer known as "Captain Jack".<ref name=Bego71>{{cite book |last=Bego |first=Mark |title=Billy Joel: The Biography |year=2007 |page=71}}</ref> "It's about coming out of the New York suburbs," Joel told [[John Kalodner]] in 1974. "But in my travels I have seen a lot of the same suburb all over the country.  The song is sort of brutal, but sometimes it is good to be brutal and offend people -- it keeps them on their toes."<ref name=Kalodner>{{cite news |last=Kalodner |first=John |title=Billy Joel: From Barroom to Big Time |publisher=Concert |date=April 1974 |url=http://www.johnkalodner.com/BillyJoelReview.html |accessdate=2007-07-09}}</ref>

The song, according to Joel, is an anti-drug song. He says, "What's so horrible about an affluent young white teenager's life that he's got to shoot heroin? It's really a song about what I consider to be a pathetic loser kind of lifestyle. I've been accused of, 'Oh, this song promotes drug use and masturbation.' No, no, no. Listen to the song. This guy is a loser."<ref name=Bego71/> In writing about the song in the liner notes of his live ''[[Songs in the Attic]]'' album, Joel once again emphasized the point: "...so many friends shoveled under the Long Island dirt. The miracle of modern chemistry killed them if Vietnam didn't."<ref name=Attic/>

==Pre-release==
To promote his debut album, ''[[Cold Spring Harbor]]'', Joel undertook a tour that lasted through most of the spring and into the early summer of 1972.<ref name=Angry57>{{cite book |last=Bordowitz |first=Hank |title=Billy Joel: The Life & Times of an Angry Young Man |year=2006 |page=57}}</ref> One of the people who noticed and liked the LP was the program director of Philadelphia radio station [[WMMR|WMMR-FM]], Dennis Wyland. He arranged to have Joel perform a concert for radio-station listeners who won tickets.<ref name=Glory>{{cite news |last=Detweiler |first=Margit |title=Glory Days |publisher=City Paper, Philadelphia, Pa. |date=November 26-December 3, 1998 |url=http://www.citypaper.net/articles/112698/coverstory.shtml |accessdate=2007-07-09}}</ref> On Saturday night, April 15, 1972, Joel performed an hour-long concert in front of these contest winners at [[Sigma Sound Studios]] in Philadelphia.<ref name=Bego61>{{cite book |last=Bego |first=Mark |title=Billy Joel: The Biography |year=2007 |page=61}}</ref>  Joel and his touring band from 1971-1972 (Larry Russell on bass guitar, Al Hertzberg on lead guitar, Rhys Clark on drums) performed 12 songs, seven from ''Cold Spring Harbor'' and five songs he had not yet recorded. Some of the songs were later recorded for the ''Piano Man'' LP, including "The Ballad of Billy The Kid", "Travelin' Prayer", and "Captain Jack".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.shio.org/BJ/concerts/4-15-72.html |title=Setlist, WMMR Sigma Sound Studios concert, April 15, 1972 |accessdate=2007-07-09}}</ref>

"Captain Jack" was immediately embraced by WMMR's audience.<ref name=Glory/> For the next year and a half, the station kept its live version of the song in regular rotation. Listeners called in, wanting to know where they could find the song and on what album it appeared.<ref name=Glory/> The song was such a big hit in Philadelphia that several New York radio stations got their own tape copies and began to play it as well.<ref name=Bego61/> Though Columbia Records' then-president, [[Clive Davis]], first noticed Joel at the [[Mar y Sol festival]] in [[Puerto Rico]] on Easter Sunday, April 1, 1972,<ref name=Bego65>{{cite book |last=Bego |first=Mark |title=Billy Joel: The Biography |year=2007 |page=65}}</ref> the constant airplay of Joel's unreleased song kept the label's attention.<ref name=Bego61/> Columbia Records did their best to track Joel down.<ref name=JoelBio>{{cite web |title=Billy Joel Biography - The Official Billy Joel site |url=http://www.billyjoel.com/biography |accessdate=2009-03-21}}</ref> After turning down a record deal from [[Atlantic Records]], Joel signed with Columbia in the spring of 1973.<ref name=Angry71>{{cite book |last=Bordowitz |first=Hank |title=Billy Joel: The Life & Times of an Angry Young Man |year=2006 |page=71}}</ref>

==Release and reaction==
"Captain Jack" was one of the 10 songs recorded in Los Angeles for Joel's Columbia debut, ''[[Piano Man (album)|Piano Man]]''. It quickly became a staple of FM rock stations after the album's release in November 1973.<ref name=Regional>{{cite web | title = Fiery Billy Joel Still Loves the Stage/Pop Star Survives Years on the Road, Changes in Music | publisher =''[[Houston Chronicle]]'' | date =1990-11-18 | url = http://www.chron.com/CDA/archives/archive.mpl?id=1990_744027  | accessdate = 2009-03-21 }}</ref> This song, along with the songs "Piano Man" and "[[The Entertainer (song)|The Entertainer]]", were the songs that Joel was best known for before the release of ''[[The Stranger (album)|The Stranger]]'' in 1977.<ref name=Attic/>

Reception for the song was mostly positive. Jack Breschard of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' called it one of Joel's "best efforts".<ref name=PianoManReview>{{cite web |title=Billy Joel: Piano Man : Music Reviews : Rolling Stone |url=http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/billyjoel/albums/album/230930/review/5945044/piano_man |accessdate=2009-03-21}}</ref> Ira Mayer called it Joel's "signature piece,"<ref name=Mayer>{{cite web |title=Billy Joel: The Stranger : Music Reviews : Rolling Stone |url=http://www.rollingstone.com/reviews/album/107192/review/6067349?utm_source=Rhapsody&utm_medium=CDreview |accessdate=2009-03-21}}</ref> and Stephen Holden said the song, a "centerpiece" of the album, "compelled attention for [its] despairing portraits of urban fringe life, despite [the] underlying shallowness."<ref name=Holden>{{cite web |title=Billy Joel: Streetlife Serenade : Music Reviews : Rolling Stone |url=http://www.rollingstone.com/reviews/album/200781/review/5942638?utm_source=Rhapsody&utm_medium=CDreview |accessdate=2009-03-21}}</ref> Holden also believed that the song had a [[Bob Dylan]] feel to it. "As with so many rock stars, one of his most important early influences was Bob Dylan<U+2013>in fact, "Piano Man" and "Captain Jack," two of his more ambitious early tunes, as well as the more recent and better "She's Always a Woman," are practically keyboard parodies of Dylan critiques," Holden says.<ref name=Holden2>{{cite web |title=Billy Joel: 52nd Street : Music Reviews : Rolling Stone |url=http://www.rollingstone.com/reviews/album/287478/review/6068308?utm_source=Rhapsody&utm_medium=CDreview |accessdate=2009-03-21}}</ref> Author Hank Bordowitz called "Captain Jack" "as bleak a portrait of growing up in the affluent suburbs as anything before L.A. punk hit nearly a decade later".<ref name=Angry62>{{cite book |last=Bordowitz |first=Hank |title=Billy Joel: The Life & Times of an Angry Young Man |year=2006 |publisher=Billboard Books |location=New York |isbn=978-0-8230-8248-3 |page=62}}</ref> However, Stuart Levine of ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' felt that while the song was "lyrically expansive," it was also a "dark" song by Joel.<ref name=Varietyjack>{{cite web | title = Billy Joel | publisher =''Variety'' | date ={{Start date|2008|2|23|df=yes}} | url = http://www.variety.com/review/VE1117936297.html?categoryid=1266&cs=1 |accessdate={{Start date|2009|4|10|df=yes}}|author=Levine, Stuart}}</ref> Ron Rosenbaum of ''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]'', in a review of Joel's songs, was not a fan of the song, summing it up by saying, "Loser dresses up in poseur clothes and masturbates and shoots up heroin and is an all-around phony in the eyes of the songwriter who is so, so superior to him."<ref name=JackNeg>{{cite web | title = The Worst Pop Singer Ever: Why, Exactly, is Billy Joel so Bad? | publisher =''Slate'' | date ={{Start date|2009|1|23|df=yes}} | url = http://www.slate.com/id/2209526/ |accessdate={{Start date|2009|4|10|df=yes}}|author=Rosenbaum, Rom}}</ref>

Joel made his first television appearance in the wake of the release of ''Piano Man'', on the syndicated ''[[Don Kirshner's Rock Concert]]'' program, in a performance recorded live in [[Chicago, Illinois|Chicago]] in March 1974. "Captain Jack" was one of the three songs that were broadcast.<ref name=Live>{{cite web |title=History of Live Performances by Billy Joel |url=http://www.shio.org/BJ/concerts/ |accessdate=2007-07-09}}</ref> In keeping with U.S. broadcast television standards of the time, Joel was forced to alter the lyrics slightly. Instead of singing the line "You just sit at home and masturbate", he sang, "You just sit at home and la la la". Kirshner recalled, "I knew he was going to be a big star, and so did he."<ref name=Bego76>{{cite book |last=Bego |first=Mark |title=Billy Joel: The Biography |year=2007 |page=76}}</ref>

By 1980, "Captain Jack" had mostly disappeared from Joel's concert setlists.<ref name=Attic/> Nevertheless, he always played it in Philadelphia, because he never forgot the role the song and the city played in his early career.<ref name=Attic/> A version recorded at [[Wachovia Spectrum|The Spectrum]] in July 1980 was used on his live album, ''[[Songs in the Attic]]''. Joel wrote, "'Captain Jack' plays with much more power and conviction when a roaring Philadelphia audience sets off a kind of internal explosion and the adrenaline screams through our veins ... When we play 'Captain Jack', we are actually committing an act of pure brutality."<ref name=Attic/> Timothy White of ''Rolling Stone'' did not like this version, calling it "grating".<ref name=Attic2>{{cite web |title=Billy Joel: Songs in the Attic : Music Reviews : Rolling Stone |url=http://www.rollingstone.com/reviews/album/232191/review/5942960/songsintheattic |accessdate=2009-03-21}}</ref>

The song entered the news again in 2000 when it was mistakenly used during [[Hillary Clinton]]'s announcement that she would be campaigning for [[U.S. Senate]]. Her presumed opponent, [[Rudolph Giuliani]], who ended up not running for the Senate, criticized the song's use because of its alleged glorification of drugs. Giuliani even read the lyrics to the song in a live press conference.<ref name=JackPost /> Joel replied in a statement, "There are a lot of important issues facing the voters in this Senate race. Is a politician's interpretation of a song I wrote nearly 30 years ago an issue to the voters of New York state? I do not think so."<ref>{{cite web |last=Hiatt |first=Brian |title=Billy Joel Did Start the Fire in N.Y.

It was played from the Billy Joel compilation CD "[[Greatest Hits (Billy Joel albums)#Disc one|Greatest Hits Volume 1]]", and the song intended to be played was "[[New York State of Mind]]", which was track five on the CD.<ref name=JackPost /> The Clinton staffer inadvertently played track two, which was "Captain Jack".<ref name=JackPost>{{cite web | title = Candidates' Tunes Hit A Few Sour Notes | publisher =''[[The Washington Post]]'' | date =2008-01-17 | url = http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/01/16/AR2008011604152_2.html  | accessdate = 2008-11-22 }}</ref>
