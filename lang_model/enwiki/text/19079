"'''Donde Quiera Que Est<U+00E9>s'''" ({{lang-en|Wherever You Are}}) is a duet by American [[Tejano music|Tejano pop]] singer [[Selena]] and [[Nuyorican]] band the [[Barrio Boyzz]], released as the [[lead single]] from the Barrio Boyzz album ''[[Dondequiera Que Estes (album)|Dondequiera Que Est<U+00E9>s]]'' (1993). It was written by [[K. C. Porter]], [[Miguel Flores]], [[Desmond Child]], and produced by [[A.B. Quintanilla III]], [[Domingo (producer)|Domingo Padilla]] and [[Bebu Silvetti]]. [[EMI Latin]] wanted Selena to record the song with the Barrio Boyzz because of the band's popularity in the [[Northeastern United States (U.S. Census Bureau)|Northeastern United States]], where Selena was not well known, and it could help boost her fame, fan base and bookings in cities like New York City, Boston and Philadelphia. [[SBK Records]] accepted the offer because the Barrio Boyzz were not recognized in the Southern United States, Selena's home ground. 

After Selena was [[Murder of Selena|murdered]] while working on a crossover album, EMI Latin wanted to release the unfinished album, but they were short of songs. They contacted the Barrio Boyzz to re-record their verse of "Donde quiera que est<U+00E9>s" in English, while Selena's Spanish verse remained the same. The song was subsequently named "Wherever You Are". "Donde quiera que est<U+00E9>s" is an [[Urban pop|urban fusion]] song performed in a moderate [[Contemporary R&B|R&B]] pop [[groove (music)|groove]]. It was promoted through the Barrio Boyzz' Donde Quiera Que Est<U+00E9>s Tour in 1993<U+2013>94 and Selena's [[Amor Prohibido Tour]] in 1994<U+2013>95. All performances were in the style of [[Urban culture|urban]] dance. The song, and its music video released in December 1993, received positive reviews from music critics.

The song was nominated for "Vocal Duo of the Year" at the [[1994 Tejano Music Awards]], and again for the same category in 1995 and posthumously in 1996. The song was certified Gold in Mexico and Argentina in the [[Music download|digital download]] category, and Gold in Spain for selling more than 20,000 copies. It peaked at number one on the ''Billboard'' [[Hot Latin Tracks]] and [[Latin Pop Airplay]], number thirty-six on the [[Rhythmic Top 40]], number eighty-nine on the [[Canadian Hot 100]], number two on the [[Productores de M<U+00FA>sica de Espa<U+00F1>a|Spanish Top 50 Songs]] and number four on the SP Airplay Chart. It has been covered by many artists since its release.

The lyrics convey the love felt by two people separated by vast distances. The song starts off with a boy waking up thinking about his ex-girlfriend, while she sings that she is crying for his love and that pictures of them together, smiling and hugging, still hang on her walls. The [[Bridge (music)|chorus]] begins with the boy singing that, wherever she may be, he will remember her and that he will always be her first love, while Selena repeats. The boy then sings that only loneliness lives inside him and that only memories of her are still in his mind, while her kisses still linger on his lips. After this he asks "will time and distance make you want me more? and bring me back your love?" while Selena sings that "only time will tell". He then repeats that he is her first love, before asking her for the last time "will time and distance make you want me more? and bring me back your love?", ending the song.

== Music video ==
=== Background and synopsis ===
The music video for "Donde queira que est<U+00E9>s" was filmed on November 10, 1993, with Laurice Bell directing.<ref name="TopThirteen">{{Cite episode |title=Top Tr3ce Selena Moments |episodelink=Tr3s (TV network) #Music video shows |series=Top Tr3ce |serieslink= |credits=A.B.

The video opens with David Davilla holding a portrait and singing to it behind a tall complex building in New York City, while Angel Ramirez sings in harmony in front of a portrait. Seen next are Selena's mouth and lower jaw, and her hair moving with the wind. She then speaks her line while touching one side of her face, slowly moving her hands downward. The Barrio Boyzz and Selena then dance in urban style. In the next scene, Selena and Davilla sing together, and in the next, Selena is sitting on the steps outside an apartment building, resting her head on the top step, singing and appearing depressed. Later, she rejoins the Barrio Boyzz and dances urban style again. The video ends with Selena and the Barrio Boyzz singing in the sunset, behind a busy road.

=== Reception ===
The video was received positively by music critics. In his one-page special dedicated to Selena, Ra<U+00FA>l Manuel Rodr<U+00ED>guez of ''El Dictamen'' wrote that the song "... was the crossover video for both Selena and the Barrio Boyzz', as it served to help boost their performances worldwide ..."<ref name="El Dictamen">{{cite news |title=La M<U+00FA>sica De La Reina Por Siempre Vivir<U+00E1>. |author=Ra<U+00FA>l Manuel Rodr<U+00ED>guez |url= |newspaper=El Dictamen |date=March 17, 2009 |accessdate=July 13, 2011|language=Spanish}}</ref> Rodr<U+00ED>guez placed the song at number seven in his "Top 10 Selena music videos".<ref name="El Dictamen"/> Juanita Carmen Jimenez of ''[[Furia Musical]]'' stated that the music video had instantly made her want to dance and commented that "...
