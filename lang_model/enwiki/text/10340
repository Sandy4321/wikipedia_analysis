==Plot==
One night while drinking beer at [[Moe's Tavern]], [[Homer Simpson|Homer]] tells the story of how he got his big break. He begins with the family attending "[[Springfield Nuclear Power Plant|Nuclear Plant]] Employee, Spouses and No More Than Three Children Night" at the Springfield Isotopes [[baseball]] game at the [[Springfield (The Simpsons)|Springfield]] [[minor league baseball]] stadium. At the game, Homer's hopes of letting loose at the ballpark are ruined when his boss [[Montgomery Burns|Mr. Burns]] sits next to him. To Homer's surprise, Mr. Burns buys him several rounds of beer to show good company relations, and the two begin taunting the Isotopes together. The team is expected to lose their twenty-seventh consecutive game, reportedly the longest losing streak in professional baseball. However, when a drunk Homer fires up the crowd with an impromptu dance to the tune of "[[Baby Elephant Walk]]", the Isotopes win the game.

Homer is offered the job as team mascot of the Springfield Isotopes by the team's owner. He accepts, and because of his enthusiasm at the games, the Isotopes go on a winning streak. Homer is soon informed that he is going to be promoted to the "big leagues" in [[List of fictional locations in The Simpsons#Capital City|Capital City]], where he will fill in for the [[List of celebrities in The Simpsons#Capital City Goofball|Capital City Goofball]] as the mascot of the Capital City Capitals. The Simpson family pack up their things, say goodbye to their friends, and move to the big city. Homer's first performance becomes a disaster as his small-town routine flops before the big-city crowd, and he is [[booing|booed]] off the field and promptly fired. Homer sadly finishes his story, only to find that the barflies are still pretty impressed.

Homer's chants and his nickname "Dancin' Homer" is a reference to American baseball fan [[Wild Bill Hagy]], who earned the nickname "The Roar from Thirty-Four" for his chants during the 1970s in section thirty-four at [[Baltimore]]'s [[Memorial Stadium (Baltimore)|Memorial Stadium]].

Since airing, the episode has received mostly positive reviews from television critics. DVD Movie Guide's Colin Jacobson said it was "probably the best episode" of the season, and commented that "Dancin' Homer" offered a "consistently satisfying show. Like the better episodes, it packed a lot of action into its twenty-three minutes, as Homer<U+2019>s saga took on a near epic feeling. It also contained more wonderfully bizarre asides than usual at this point in the series<U+2019> run. From the [[Rastafarian]]s who appear in the crowd when Homer performs 'Baby Elephant Walk', to the existence of the Players<U+2019> Ex-Wives section at the ballpark, the episode provided a fun and rich program."<ref name="dvdmg">{{cite web|url=http://www.dvdmg.com/simpsonsseason2.shtml|title=The Simpsons: The Complete Second Season |last=Jacobson|first=Colin|publisher=DVD Movie Guide|accessdate=2009-03-23}}</ref> The authors of the book ''I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide'', Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, wrote: "Understanding baseball isn't really a requirement for this episode, as the humor doesn't come from the games so much as the personalities. Tony Bennett's cameo is great, and Homer's dance has rightly become legendary."<ref name="BBC">{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/cult/simpsons/episodeguide/season2/page5.shtml|title=Dancin' Homer|accessdate=2009-03-12|author=Martyn, Warren; Wood, Adrian |date=2000|publisher=BBC}}</ref> The episode was by Jerry Greene of the ''[[Orlando Sentinel]]'' named the third best episode of the show with a sports theme.<ref>{{cite news|title=D'oh!
