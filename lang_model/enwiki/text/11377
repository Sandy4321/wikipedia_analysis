'''Clifford Williams''' (born 14 December 1949) is an English [[bassist]] and [[backing vocalist]], who has been a member of the Australian [[hard rock]] band [[AC/DC]] since mid-1977. He had started his professional music career in 1967 and was previously in the British groups [[Home (UK band)|Home]] and [[Bandit (band)|Bandit]]. His first studio album with AC/DC was ''[[Powerage]]'' in 1978. The band, including Williams, was inducted into the American [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] in 2003. Williams's playing style is noted for basic bass lines which follow the rhythm guitar. Williams's side projects, while a member of AC/DC, include benefit concerts and playing with Emir & Frozen Camels on their album ''San'' (2002) and an European tour.

==Biography==
===Early career===
{{Main|Home (UK band)|Bandit (band)}}
Cliff Williams was born on 14 December 1949 in [[Romford]], [[Essex]], on the outskirts of London.{{sfn|Sutcliffe|2010|p=57}}{{sfn|Rivadavia}} The Williams family moved to Hoylake, near [[Liverpool]], in 1961, where he was influenced by the local [[Beat music|Merseybeat]] movement and decided to become a rock musician.{{sfn|Rivadavia}}<ref name=frontiers>{{cite web|url=http://www.bassfrontiersmag.com/cliff-williams-acdc-video-interview|author=Fox, Gene; Fowler, Dave|title=Video Interview: Cliff Williams of AC/DC|work=Bass Frontiers Magazine|date=2010-10-30|accessdate=2011-09-11}}</ref> At the age of 13, he and some friends formed a band.{{sfn|Rivadavia}} Williams has listed [[The Rolling Stones]], [[The Beatles]], [[The Kinks]] and [[blues]] musicians such as [[Bo Diddley]] as influences for his style. He mostly learned to play [[bass guitar]] by "listening to records and picking out notes", with formal training limited to some lessons from a professional Liverpool bassist.<ref name=school>{{cite journal|title=The High Voltage bass power of AC/DC's Cliff Williams |journal=Guitar School|first=Michael|last=Duclos|date=March 1995}}</ref> Williams left school when he was 16 years old, becoming an engineer by day and musician by night.<ref name=frontiers/>

In 1967, Williams became a professional musician and moved back to London,{{sfn|Rivadavia}}<ref name=frontiers/> where he worked at a demolition site and in supermarkets, and played in short-lived bands.{{Sfn|Sutcliffe|2010|p=57}} Williams met [[guitarist]] [[Laurie Wisefield]] (later a member of [[Wishbone Ash]]), and the two became members of a band, Sugar, which soon broke up.{{sfn|Rivadavia}}<ref name="ARDbACDC">{{Cite web | url = http://hem.passagen.se/honga/database/a/acdc.html |work=[[Australian Rock Database]] | title = AC/DC | publisher = Magnus Holmgren | last1 = Holmgren | first1 = Magnus | accessdate = 2011-09-18 }}</ref><ref name=ash>{{cite web|url=http://www.wishboneash.co.uk/history/6_5.aspx|title=Band Member Profiles: Laurie Wisefield - Guitar/Vocals|publisher=[[Wishbone Ash]] Official Website|accessdate=2011-09-11}}</ref>

In 1970, Williams and Wisefield joined with [[singer]] Mick Stubbs, [[Electronic keyboard|keyboardist]] Clive John and drummer Mick Cook to form the [[progressive rock]] group [[Home (UK band)|Home]].{{sfn|Rivadavia}}<ref name="ARDbACDC"/> The band signed a recording deal with [[Epic Records]] and issued their debut LP, ''[[Pause for a Hoarse Horse]]'', in 1971.<ref name=ash/> Home was a supporting act for [[Jeff Beck]], [[Mott the Hoople]], [[The Faces]] and [[Led Zeppelin]].{{sfn|Rivadavia}} In 1972, Jim Anderson replaced John on keyboards and Home released [[Home (Home album)|a self-titled album]], featuring their only hit single, "Dreamer", which peaked at No.&nbsp;41 in the UK album charts.{{sfn|Sutcliffe|2010|p=213}} Their next album, ''The Alchemist'', followed in 1973, but did not gain chart success. When British [[folk music|folk]] [[singer-songwriter]] [[Al Stewart]] suggested that Home back him on his first American tour in March 1974, Mick Stubbs left the group. The rest of the members became the Al Stewart Band, but split up after the tour.<ref name="ARDbACDC"/><ref name=ash/>

Williams briefly played with the American band Stars before forming [[Bandit (band)|Bandit]] in 1974.{{Sfn|Sutcliffe|2010|p=57}}<ref name="ARDbACDC"/> Bandit's line-up included vocalist [[Jim Diamond (Scottish musician)|Jim Diamond]] and drummer Graham Broad (later in [[Bucks Fizz (band)|Bucks Fizz]] and [[Roger Waters]]'s band). The group signed with [[Arista Records]] and released a self-titled album in 1977.

In 1977, Cliff Williams considered retiring from music when Bandit disbanded, but one of the group's guitarists, Jimmy Litherland, convinced him to audition for Australian heavy rockers [[AC/DC]]. They were looking for a bassist as [[Mark Evans (musician)|Mark Evans]] had been fired shortly after recording the 1977 studio album ''[[Let There Be Rock]]''.<ref name=gulf>{{cite journal|url=http://www.gulfshorelife.com/ARTICLES/Past-Issues/2007/April-2007/Conversation.aspx|title=Conversation: "It<U+2019>s Like Razor Blades Out There"|journal=Gulf Shore Magazine|date=April 2007}}</ref><ref name=austin>{{cite web|url=http://www.austinchronicle.com/music/2008-08-29/666442/|title=Let There Be Rock: AC/DC @ the 'Dillo|first=Marky|last=Billson|work=[[Austin Chronicle]]|date=2008-08-29|accessdate=2011-09-11}}</ref> AC/DC had formed in Australia in 1973 and by mid-1977 the line-up was [[Malcolm Young]] on rhythm guitar and backing vocals alongside his brother [[Angus Young]] on lead guitar, [[Phil Rudd]] on drums and [[Bon Scott]] on vocals.<ref name="ARDbACDC"/><ref name="McF">{{Cite web|first=Ian|last=McFarlane|url=http://www.whammo.com.au/encyclopedia.asp?articleid=9|title=Encyclopedia entry for 'AC/DC'|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20040806010608/www.whammo.com.au/encyclopedia.asp?articleid=9|archivedate=2004-08-06|work=Whammo.com.au|accessdate=2011-11-13}}</ref> Williams said shortly after being told about AC/DC's auditions, he saw the band on ''[[Top of the Pops]]'' and reacted positively,<ref name=frontiers/> describing them as "outrageous".<ref name=bassplayer/>

Cliff Williams' role in AC/DC is to provide a steady but basic [[bass line]]s which follow the [[rhythm guitar]] of Malcolm Young,{{sfn|Rivadavia}} consisting mostly of [[eighth note]]s.<ref name=powerage>{{Cite album-notes|title=[[Powerage]]|artist=[[AC/DC]]|publisher=[[Epic Records]]|format=CD|year=2003|author=Welch, Ernie}}</ref> His bass lines are sometimes written by Malcolm and Angus Young during composition, and at other times Williams develops them based on the other instrumental tracks.<ref name=hrm>{{cite journal|title=Cliff Williams: The Cool Power|journal=Hard Rock Mag|date=December 1996}}</ref> Williams said he plays "the same thing in every song, for the most part.
