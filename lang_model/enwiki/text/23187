The '''River Severn''' ([[Welsh language|Welsh]]: ''Afon [[Hafren]]'', [[Latin]]: ''[[Sabrina#Myth|Sabrina]]'') is the longest [[river]] in the [[United Kingdom]], at about {{convert|354|km|mi|0}},<ref>{{cite web

  }}</ref> and the second longest in the [[British Isles]], behind the [[River Shannon]]. It rises at an altitude of {{convert|610|m|ft|0}} on [[Plynlimon]], [[Ceredigion]] near [[Llanidloes]], [[Powys]], in the [[Cambrian Mountains]] of [[mid Wales]]. It then flows through [[Shropshire]], [[Worcestershire]] and [[Gloucestershire]], with the [[county town]]s of [[Shrewsbury]], [[Worcester]], and [[Gloucester]] on its banks. With an average discharge of 107&nbsp;m<U+00B3>/s at [[Apperley]], Gloucestershire, the Severn is the greatest river in terms of water flow in England and Wales.

The river is usually considered to become the [[Severn Estuary]] after the [[Second Severn Crossing]] between [[Severn Beach]], [[South Gloucestershire]] and [[Sudbrook, Monmouthshire|Sudbrook]], [[Monmouthshire]]. The river then discharges into the [[Bristol Channel]] which in turn  discharges into the [[Celtic Sea]] and the wider [[Atlantic Ocean]].  The Severn's drainage basin area is {{convert|11420|km2|sqmi|0}}, excluding the [[River Wye]] and [[River Avon, Bristol|Bristol Avon]] which flow into the Severn Estuary. The major tributaries to the Severn are the [[River Vyrnwy|Vyrnwy]], [[River Teme|Teme]], [[Upper Avon|Warwickshire Avon]] and [[River Stour, Worcestershire|Stour]].

==Etymology and mythology==
The name Severn is thought to derive from a [[Brythonic languages|Celtic]] original name ''*sabrinn-<U+00E2>'', of uncertain meaning.<ref>[http://kimkat.org/amryw/1_vortaroy/geiriadur_cymraeg_saesneg_BAEDD_h_1038e.htm Etymology of ''Hafren'']</ref> That name then developed in different languages to become ''Sabrina'' to the Romans, ''Hafren'' in [[Welsh language|Welsh]], and Severn in English. A folk etymology later developed, deriving the name from a mythical story of a [[nymph]], Sabrina, who drowned in the river.<ref>{{cite web

==Tributary rivers==
The [[River Stour, Worcestershire|River Stour]] rises in the north of Worcestershire in the [[Clent Hills]], near St Kenelm's Church at [[Romsley, Worcestershire|Romsley]].  It flows north into the adjacent [[West Midlands (county)|West Midlands]] at [[Halesowen]]. It then flows westwards through [[Cradley Heath]] and [[Stourbridge]] where it leaves the [[Black Country]].  It is joined by the Smestow Brook at Prestwood before it winds around southwards to [[Kinver]], and then flows back into Worcestershire.  It then passes through [[Wolverley]], [[Kidderminster]] and [[Wilden, Worcestershire|Wilden]] to its [[confluence]] with the Severn at [[Stourport-on-Severn]].

The [[River Vyrnwy]], which begins at [[Lake Vyrnwy]], flows eastwards through [[Powys]] before forming part of the border between England and Wales, joining the Severn near [[Melverley]], [[Shropshire]]. The [[Rea Brook]] flows north from its source in the [[Stiperstones]] and joins the Severn at [[Shrewsbury]]. The [[River Tern]], after flowing south from [[Market Drayton]] and being joined by the [[River Roden, Shropshire|River Roden]], meets the Severn at [[Attingham Park]].

The [[River Worfe]] joins the Severn, just above [[Bridgnorth]]. The [[River Stour, Worcestershire|River Stour]] rising on the [[Clent Hills]] and flowing through [[Halesowen]], [[Stourbridge]], and [[Kidderminster]], joins the Severn at [[Stourport]].  On the opposite bank, the tributaries are only brooks, Borle Brook, [[Dowles Brook]] draining the [[Wyre Forest]] and [[Dick Brook]].
[[Image:SevernSource06.JPG|thumb|right|The source of the River Severn in the Winter of 2006.]]
The [[River Teme]] flows eastwards from its source in [[Mid Wales]], straddling the border between [[Shropshire]] and [[Herefordshire]], it is joined by the [[River Onny]], [[River Corve]] and [[River Rea, Shropshire|River Rea]] before it finally joins the Severn slightly downstream of [[Worcester, England|Worcester]]. [[Shit Brook]] near [[Much Wenlock]] was culverted to flow into the Severn.

One of the several rivers named Avon, in this case the [[River Avon, Warwickshire|Warwickshire Avon]], flows west through [[Rugby, Warwickshire|Rugby]], [[Warwick]] and [[Stratford-upon-Avon]]. It is then joined by its tributary the [[River Arrow (Worcestershire)|River Arrow]], before finally  joining the Severn at [[Tewkesbury]], [[Gloucestershire]].

The port of [[Bristol]] is located on the [[Severn Estuary]], where another [[River Avon, Bristol|River Avon]] flows into it through the [[Avon Gorge]].

The [[River Wye]], from its source in [[Plynlimon]], [[Wales]], flows generally south east through the Welsh towns of [[Rhayader]] and [[Builth Wells]]. It enters [[Herefordshire]], flows through [[Hereford]], and is shortly afterwards joined by the [[River Lugg]], before flowing through [[Ross-on-Wye]] and [[Monmouth]], and then southwards where it forms part of the boundary between England ([[Forest of Dean]]) and [[Wales]].  It flows into the Severn near the town of [[Chepstow]], slightly upstream of the [[Bristol Avon]] on the opposite bank.

The [[River Usk]] flows into the Severn Estuary just south of [[Newport]].

[[Image:UffingtonShropshire.JPG|thumb|right|The Severn bridged by the [[A49 road]] just outside [[Shrewsbury]]. The village of [[Uffington, Shropshire]] is located in the foreground.]]
{{Main|Crossings of the River Severn}}

The Severn is bridged at many places, and many of these bridges are notable in their own right, with several designed and built by the engineer [[Thomas Telford]]. There also is the famous [[The Iron Bridge|Iron Bridge]] at [[Ironbridge]], which was the world's first iron arch bridge.

The two road bridges of the [[Severn crossing]] link Wales with the southern counties of England.
*[[Severn Bridge]] &mdash; opened in 1966 carrying what is now the [[M48 motorway|M48]]
*[[Second Severn Crossing]] &mdash; opened in 1996 carrying the [[M4 motorway|M4]] [[motorway]]

Prior to the construction of the first bridge in 1966, the channel was crossed by the [[Aust Ferry]].

Other notable bridges include: 

* [[Buttington]] Bridge-built in 1872
* Montford Bridge-Thomas Telford's first ever bridge design, built between 1790 and 1792
* Welsh Bridge (pictured)-in the centre of Shrewsbury, built in 1795 at a cost of <U+00A3>8,000
* English Bridge-also in Shrewsbury, designed and completed in 1774 by John Gwynn
* [[Atcham]] Bridges-the old one built in 1774, while the newer one in 1929 carries the B4380
* Albert Edward Bridge-in Coalbrookdale, a rail bridge opened in 1864
* [[Coalport]] Bridge-like its neighbour Ironbridge, is made of cast iron, built in 1818
* Bewdley Bridge-designed by Thomas Telford, completed in 1798
* [[Holt Fleet]] Bridge-in Worcestershire and designed by Thomas Telford and opened in 1828
* Upton town bridge-built in 1940,the only bridge to cross between Worcester and Tewkesbury
* Queenshill Viaduct-carries the M50 between Junction 1 and 2
* Mythe Bridge-designed by Thomas Telford and opened in April 1826, located in Tewkesbury
* Haw Bridge-a steel beam bridge, west of Tewkesbury
* Maisemore Bridge-carries the A417 and is a single masonry arch, dating back to 1230.   
* Over Bridge-single masonry arch, built by Telford
* Over Rail Bridge-last bridge before the Old Severn Crossing, which is 30 miles downstream

===Rail===
The [[Severn Tunnel]], completed in 1886 by [[John Hawkshaw]] on behalf of the [[Great Western Railway]], lies near the [[Second Severn Crossing]] road bridge, and carries the [[South Wales Main Line]] section of the [[Great Western Main Line]] under the channel.  The original line built before the [[Severn Tunnel]] was the [[South Wales Railway]] from [[Gloucester railway station|Gloucester]], that followed the estuary alongside present day stations of [[Lydney railway station|Lydney]], [[Chepstow railway station|Chepstow]], [[Caldicot railway station|Caldicot]] and [[Severn Tunnel Junction]] to [[Newport railway station|Newport]].

Cars could also be transported through the Severn Tunnel. In the 1950s three trains a day made round trips between [[Severn Tunnel Junction railway station|Severn Tunnel Junction]] and [[Pilning railway station|Pilning]]. The vehicles were loaded onto open flat bed carriages and pulled by a small [[Pannier tank|pannier tank locomotive]], although sometimes they were joined to a scheduled passenger train. The prudent owner paid to cover the vehicle with a sheet, as sparks often flew when the [[steam locomotive]] tackled the slope leading to the tunnel exit. A rail coach was provided for passengers and drivers. Reservations could be made and the fee for the car was about thirty shillings (<U+00A3>1.50) in the early 1950s.

===Disasters===
[[Image:TewkesburyFloods210707.jpg|thumb|right|[[Tewkesbury]] during the [[2007 United Kingdom floods|2007 floods]]]]
There have been many [[disasters on the Severn]] and it has claimed many lives (figures vary depending on how it is recorded, circa 300 people), especially during the 20th century.  The [[Severn Railway Bridge]] was badly damaged by the collision of two river barges in 1960, which led to its demolition in 1970. Five crew members of both the Arkendale H and Wastdale H died in the accident. <ref>Ron Huxley, The rise and fall of the Severn Bridge Railway, 1984, ISBN 978-1-84868-033-3</ref>

===Navigation===
There is a public right of navigation between [[Pool Quay]], near [[Welshpool]], and [[Stourport-on-Severn|Stourport]]. However this stretch of the river has little traffic, other than small pleasure boats, canoes and some tour boats in Shrewsbury. Below Stourport, where the river is more navigable for larger craft, users must obtain permits from the [[Canal & River Trust]], who are the [[navigation authority]].  During spring [[freshet]] the river can be closed to navigation.

At Upper Parting above Gloucester, the river divides into two, and flows either side of [[Alney Island]] to Lower Parting.  The West Channel is no longer navigable.  The East Channel is navigable as far as Gloucester Docks, from where the [[Gloucester and Sharpness Canal]] provides a navigable channel south.  Between the docks and Lower Parting [[Llanthony Secunda|Llanthony Weir]] marks the Normal Tidal Limit (NTL) of the East Channel of the river.<ref>[http://getamap.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/getamap/frames.htm?mapAction=gaz&gazName=p&gazString=GLOUCESTER Ordnance Survey]</ref>

In the tidal section of the river below Gloucester, the [[Gloucester Harbour Trustees]] are the competent harbour authority.

===Locks===
There are locks on the lower Severn to enable seagoing boats to reach as far as [[Stourport]]. The most northerly lock is at Lincombe, about a mile downstream from Stourport.

===Associated canals===
{{River Severn map}}
The [[Staffordshire and Worcestershire Canal]], the [[Worcester and Birmingham Canal]], (both narrow beam) and the [[Herefordshire and Gloucestershire Canal]] join the Severn at [[Stourport-on-Severn|Stourport]], [[Worcester]] and [[Gloucester]] respectively. The [[Droitwich Canal|Droitwich Barge Canal]], a broad beam canal, joins the Severn at [[Hawford]], near to the [[River Salwarpe]], and connects to the Droitwich Canal (narrow beam) in the name town, which then forms a link to the Worcester and Birmingham Canal. The two Droitwich canals are due to re-open in 2010 after major restoration.

The [[Gloucester and Sharpness Canal]] connects the Severn at Gloucester to the Severn at [[Sharpness]], avoiding a stretch of the tidal river which is dangerous to navigate.  The [[Stroudwater Navigation]] used to join the tidal Severn at [[Framilode]], but since the 1920s has connected to the Severn only via the Gloucester and Sharpness Canal.

The [[Lydney Canal]] is a short canal which connects [[Lydney]] to the river. 

The section of the river between Tewkesbury and Worcester forms part of the [[Avon Ring]], a {{convert|109|mi|km|adj=on}} circular cruising route which includes 129 locks and covers parts of three other waterways.

===Passenger transport===

====The tidal river====
[[Paddle steamer]]s were operated in the Severn Estuary from the mid 19th century to the late 1970s by [[P and A Campbell]] of [[Bristol]].  Since 1986 Waverley Excursions has operated occasional sailings to Sharpness and Lydney by the ''[[MV Balmoral]]''.<ref>[http://www.waverleyexcursions.co.uk/bristol.htm Waverley Excursions website]</ref>

A number of ferries were also operated on the tidal river, for example at [[New Passage]], [[Purton, Berkeley|Purton]] and [[Arlingham]].  The last ferry was the [[Aust Ferry]], which closed in 1966 when the Severn Bridge opened. One of the Aust ferries, ''Severn Princess'', is still in [[Chepstow]] although largely derelict.

====The upper river====
In Worcester, the [[Worcester River Cruises]] have boat trips up and down the river between [[Tewkesbury]] and [[Stourport]], operating the boats ''The Pride of the Midlands'' and ''The Earl Grosvenor''.<ref>[http://www.worcesterrivercruises.co.uk/home.html Worcester River Cruises website]</ref>

The Cathedral Ferry, a foot passenger ferry, also operates on Summer weekends from the steps of [[Worcester Cathedral]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2012}}

In Shropshire the [[Hampton Loade Ferry]] operates across the river.

In Shrewsbury, boat trips around the loop of the town centre are at present provided by the ''Sabrina'' and depart from Victoria Quay near the [[Welsh Bridge]] during the summer.<ref>[http://www.shrewsburyboat.co.uk/ Shrewsbury Boat website]</ref>

==Severn Estuary==
{{Main|Severn Estuary}}
[[Image:Severn Aerial.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Severn crossing|Severn bridges]] crossing near the mouth of the '''River Severn''']]
The river becomes tidal at [[Maisemore]], on the West Channel just north of Gloucester, and at Llanthony Weir on the East Channel.  The tidal river downstream from Gloucester is sometimes referred to as the Severn Estuary, but the river is usually considered to become the Severn Estuary after the [[Second Severn Crossing]] near [[Severn Beach]], [[South Gloucestershire]] (the point to which the jurisdiction of the [[Gloucester Harbour Trustees]] extends), or at [[Aust]], the site of the [[Severn Bridge]].

The Severn Estuary extends to a line from [[Lavernock Point]] (south of [[Cardiff]]) to [[Sand Point, Somerset|Sand Point]] near [[Weston-super-Mare]]. West of this line is the [[Bristol Channel]]. In the Severn Estuary (or the [[Bristol Channel]] in the last two cases, depending where the boundary is drawn) are the rocky islands called [[Denny Island]], [[Steep Holm]] and [[Flat Holm]].

The estuary is about {{convert|2|mi|km}} wide at Aust, and about {{convert|9|mi|km|0}} wide between Cardiff and Weston-super-Mare.

==Severn Sea==
{{Main|Bristol Channel}}
Until [[Tudor period|Tudor times]] the Bristol Channel was known as the '''Severn Sea''', and it is still known as this in both [[Welsh language|Welsh]] and [[Cornish language|Cornish]] (M<U+00F4>r Hafren and Mor Havren respectively, with '''M<U+00F4>r''' meaning '''Sea''').

During the 18th century, the [[Devon]], [[Somerset]] and [[Exmoor]] coastline was full of smugglers. Coastguards patrolled the shores all night in all weathers, one man for every 400 metres of the path. Almost every officer and man in the [[Royal Navy]] must have taken part either in smuggling or in its prevention. The resulting skill in foul weather seamanship and coastal raiding certainly contributed to the Navy's success against [[Napoleon Bonaparte]].{{cn|date=April 2013}}

The views of the Severn Sea also inspired the poet [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]] while he was living at Nether Stowey on the edge of the Quantock hills. Three times he completed the 45 mile trek from the Quantocks to Lynton in a single day.{{cn|date=April 2013}}

==Severn bore==
{{Main|Severn bore}}
[[Image:SevernBore1994.jpg|thumb|left|Bore hitting the riverbank in 1994]]
A curious phenomenon associated with the lower reaches of the Severn is the [[tidal bore]],<ref name="Rowbotham, Severn Bore" >{{cite book

However a tidal range greater than that of the Severn is recorded from the lesser known [[Ungava Bay]] in Canada.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.co-ops.nos.noaa.gov/faq2.html#26 |title=Frequently Asked Questions - Tide Predictions and Data |publisher=Co-ops.nos.noaa.gov |date= |accessdate=2013-05-28}}</ref> During the highest tides, the rising water is funnelled up the Severn estuary into a wave that travels rapidly upstream against the river current. The largest bores occur in spring, but smaller ones can be seen throughout the year.  The bore is accompanied by a rapid rise in water level which continues for about one and a half hours after the bore has passed.

==Industry==
A {{convert|5|km|mi|sing=on}} stretch of the River Severn in [[Shropshire]], is known as [[Ironbridge Gorge]].  It was designated a [[World Heritage Site]] by [[UNESCO]] in 1986.  Its historic importance is due to its role as the centre of the [[Ironworks|iron industry]] in the early stages of the [[Industrial Revolution]].  The gorge and the village of [[Ironbridge]] get their name from the [[The Iron Bridge|Iron Bridge]] across the Severn, built in 1779, which was the first cast-iron arch bridge ever constructed.<ref>[http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/371 Unesco World Heritage listing]</ref>

==Wildlife==
The sides of the estuary are also important feeding grounds for [[wader]]s, notably at the [[Bridgwater Bay]] [[National Nature Reserves in England|National Nature Reserve]] and the [[WWT Slimbridge|Slimbridge Wildfowl Trust]].

== Literary and musical allusions ==
The River Severn is named several times in [[A.E. Housman]]'s ''[[A Shropshire Lad]]'' (1896): <U+201C>It dawns in Asia, tombstones show/And Shropshire names are read;/And the Nile spills his overflow/Beside the Severn<U+2019>s dead<U+201D> (<U+201C>1887<U+201D>); <U+201C>Severn stream<U+201D> (<U+201C>The Welsh Marches<U+201D>); and <U+201C>Severn shore<U+201D> (<U+201C>Westward from the high-hilled plain<U+2026><U+201D>).

In [[William Shakespeare]]'s "[[Henry IV, Part 1]]," [[Henry Hotspur Percy]] recalls the valor of [[Edmund Mortimer, 5th Earl of March]] in a long battle against Welshman [[Owain Glynd<U+0175>r]] upon The Severn's banks, claiming the flooding Severn "affrighted with (the warriors') bloody looks ran fearfully among the trembling reeds and hid his crisp head in the hollow bank, bloodstained with these valiant combatants."

The Severn was the inspiration for a number of works by Gloucestershire composer [[Ivor Gurney]], including the songs ''Western Sailors'' (1925) and ''Severn Meadows'' (1917).
