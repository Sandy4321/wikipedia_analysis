==== World War II ====
Constituted as '''25th Bombardment Group (Heavy)''' on December 22, 1939. Activated on February 1, 1940.  Operational squadrons were the 10th, 12th and 35th Bombardment Squadrons.   Initially trained with A-17As, assigned B-18A/B aircraft when deployed to the Caribbean.  With the outbreak of [[World War II]] the group's mission was to fly antisubmarine patrols, escort convoys, and served as part of the defense force of the Caribbean area.  In 1942, the 417th Squadron was added; in 1943 the 10th squadron was inactivated, being replaced by the 59th.

Returned to the United States in April 1944, and was reassigned to [[Second Air Force]].  Re-equipped with B-17s and programmed for overseas deployment to Europe.  This deployment was cancelled in June 1944 and the group was disbanded, with planes and personnel being sent to Europe as replacements.

The '''25th Bombardment Group (Reconnaissance)''' was formed at [[RAF Cheddington]], [[England]] as the 802d Reconnaissance Group (Provisional) on March 30, 1944, and transferred to Watton on April 12, 1944.  On August 9, 1944, the 802 RG(P) was redesignated as the 25th BG(R).  Assigned squadrons were:

* 652d Bombardment Squadron (Heavy) (YN/R4) B-17F/G, B-24J
* 653d Bombardment Squadron (Light) (WX) De Havilland Mosquito XVI
* 654th Bombardment Squadron (Special) B-25C, (XN) B-26G, A-26, (BA) De Havilland Mosquito XVI
 
The 652d Bomb Squadron originated as a provisional weather recon unit that was formed on August 31, 1943, and transferred [[RAF St Eval]] in [[Cornwall]] with [[B-17 Flying Fortress]]s on September 8, 1943 for conducting meteorological fights over the [[Atlantic Ocean]]. On October 25, 1943 it was formalized at St. Mawgan as Detachment "A" of a newly formed Combat Weather Detachment, 1st CCRC Bovingdon.  On November 23, 1943 the unit moved to [[RAF Bovingdon]] after flying 231 weather sorties.  At Bovington, the squadron was reorganized as the 8th Weather Reconnaissance Squadron  on March 28, 1944, then transferred to Watton on April 12, 1944.

The 653d and 654th Bomb Squadrons were re-located to Watton from RAF Cheddington on April 12 for special weather recon missions over enemy-occupied territory in advance of bomber formations and visual coverage of target strikes.  Pilots for the Mosquitos came from former [[P-38 Lightning]] pilots of the [[50th Fighter Squadron]] transferred from the [[342d Fighter Day Wing|342d Composite Group]] based in [[Iceland]].

From Watton the 25th continued weather flights over the waters adjacent to the [[British Isles]] and eventually to the [[Azores]] to obtain meteorological data along with night photographic missions to detect enemy activity; and daylight photographic and mapping missions over the Continent.

A B-25 Mitchell assigned to 7th Photo Group was modified for night-photography work, and flown by 25th BG personnel on night photo-recon missions using photoflash bombs.

Also, the group eventually engaged Mosquito aircraft in electronic-countermeasure missions in which chaff was spread to confuse enemy defences during Allied attacks. In November 1944, they began supporting the OSS Joan-Eleanor project flying Mosquito and A-26 aircraft to insert and communicate with secret agents in Holland and Germany. For statistical purposes, Watton classified OSS flights as Redstocking to receive group credit for these missions.

The 25th Bomb Group moved to Drew AAF, [[Florida]] during July<U+2013>August 1945, for transition to A-26 Invaders against Japan, and was deactivated on September 8, 1945.

The group flew a total of 3,370 sorties for the loss of 15 aircraft.

==== Cold War ====
The '''25th Tactical Reconnaissance Wing''' was activated on July 1, 1965 at [[Chambley-Bussieres Air Base]], [[France]] as part of [[USAFE]].   Upon activation, the wing absorbed the '''[[19th Tactical Electronic Warfare Squadron|19th Tactical Reconnaissance Squadron]]''' and '''[[42d Electronic Combat Squadron|42d Electronic Countermeasures Squadron]]'''. The squadrons were transferred from [[Toul-Rosieres Air Base|Toul-Rosieres AB]], where they operated as a detachment of the [[10th Tactical Reconnaissance Wing]], based at [[RAF Alconbury]], UK.

The 25th flew variants of the [[B-66 Destroyer|B-66 "Destroyers"]] on photo reconnaissance and electronic warfare missions.

The escalation of the conflict in SE Asia prompted the establishment of Detachment 1 of the 42 ECS at [[Takhli Royal Thai Air Force Base|Takhli RTAFB]] during February, 1966. 5 of its B-66's were sent to [[Thailand]].

On March 7, 1966, French President [[Charles De Gaulle]] announced that France would withdraw from NATO's integrated military structure. The United States was informed that it must remove its military forces from France by April 1, 1967.

On May 1, 1966, the 42d was inactivated and the squadrons remaining aircraft were deployed to Takhli RTAFB, with all of its assets in [[Thailand]] being assigned to the '''41st Tactical Electronic Warfare Squadron (TEWS)'''.

The 19th TRS and its aircraft were reassigned to the [[363d Tactical Reconnaissance Wing]], [[Shaw Air Force Base|Shaw AFB]], South Carolina. On October 15, 1966 the 25th TRW was deactivated.
