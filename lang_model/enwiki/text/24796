==Early career==
Lucas's association with [[Vic Reeves]] and [[Bob Mortimer]] began in 1992. In 1994, Lucas appeared in ''[[The Smell of Reeves and Mortimer]]''. The second series of the show featured Lucas in several sketches. He went on to star with them in ''[[Shooting Stars]]''. He quickly rose to fame as George Dawes, the giant baby, who would deliver a string of meaningless gags (often in character) and insults before delivering the score, while sitting at and playing a drum kit. Many of these parts were introduced not in the style of a baby, but of a grown man&nbsp;<U+2014> indeed, often, he would come on dressed as a specific adult such as [[Elton John]]. He also appeared on occasion as [[Marjorie Dawes]], George's mother, who also appears in ''[[Little Britain]]''. He also appeared in the Reeves & Mortimer BBC series ''[[Randall & Hopkirk (Deceased)]]'', and ''[[Catterick (TV series)|Catterick]]'' in a variety of roles. In 1999, Lucas paired up with [[David Walliams]] to create [[Rock Profile]], a comedy show that spoofed famous musicians and musical personalities. It is notable for being one of their first comedic collaborations, which fueled their inspiration to then create the well-known show, Little Britain. Lucas has also written for actor [[Sacha Baron Cohen]].

His music video appearances include; the [[Damien Hirst]]-directed video for [[Blur (band)|Blur]]'s "[[Country House]]" (as a psychoanalyst) in 1995, "Jesusland" by [[Ben Folds]] in 2005, "[[I'm with Stupid (Pet Shop Boys song)|I'm with Stupid]]" by the [[Pet Shop Boys]] and "[[Vindaloo (song)|Vindaloo]]" and "Naughty Christmas" by [[Fat Les]]. 

Lucas ventured into the world of stage musicals in 2002, when he took one of the main roles in [[Boy George]]'s musical ''[[Taboo (musical)|Taboo]]'', at The Venue, London. He played the part of infamous performance artist [[Leigh Bowery]], which required him to wear some outrageous and spectacular outfits and make-up.

Lucas also appeared in a Big Finish audio play based on the long-running BBC science-fiction series ''[[Doctor Who]]''. The play he featured in was called [[The One Doctor]] and was a light-hearted Christmas panto-style play.

==''Little Britain''==
[[Image:LittleBritain.jpg|thumb|right|Walliams and Lucas in character as [[Lou and Andy]] at [[Live 8]], July 2005]]
''[[Little Britain]]'' is commercially Lucas's most successful work. Originally a radio show on [[BBC Radio 4]], it later became a TV series. ''Little Britain'' has won numerous TV awards, spawning large DVD sales and merchandising. It plays heavily on memorable catchphrases which have become ingrained in playgrounds and offices around the UK. Lucas plays, among many others, four of the most popular characters in the series, which he writes and acts in along with [[David Walliams]]: apparently disabled [[Andy Pipkin]], teenage Bristol [[chav]] [[Vicky Pollard]], homophobic homosexual [[Daffyd Thomas]] and insensitive slimming club organiser [[Marjorie Dawes]]. Lucas has also played many other popular characters including the morbidly obese [[Bubbles DeVere]] and [[Orville The Duck]] in one sketch.

==After ''Little Britain''==
In 2005, he took his first role in a television drama, a supporting part as a [[Venice|Venetian]] duke in the [[BBC]] historical serial ''[[Casanova (2005 TV serial)|Casanova]]'', written by [[Russell T Davies]]. Since 2006, Lucas has been the voice of the radio and television character [[Digit Al]], devised as part of a public information campaign on [[Digital switchover in the United Kingdom|digital switchover]]. On 26 November 2006 he appeared on the [[BBC Radio 4]] programme ''[[Desert Island Discs]]''. He made a cameo appearance in ''[[Shaun of the Dead]]'' as the cousin of Shaun's friend Yvonne.

In 2007, he released "[[I'm Gonna Be (500 Miles)]]", originally by [[The Proclaimers]], with [[Peter Kay]] as a [[charity single]] for [[Comic Relief (charity)|Comic Relief]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Mutual Relief: Lucas and Kay join for charity single|url=http://www.chortle.co.uk/news/2006/11/17/4713/mutual_relief|work=Chortle| date=17 November 2006}}</ref> He performed the single as ''[[Little Britain]]'' character [[Andy Pipkin]], along with Kay playing as [[Phoenix Nights|Brian Potter]]. After being available for less than 48 hours on iTunes alone, the track entered the UK Top 40 at number 3. On 25 March, it went to number one, where it stayed for three weeks, selling over 400,000 copies.<ref name=mirror1/> He also starred as the irrepressible [[Mr. Toad]] in  ''[[The Wind in the Willows (2006 film)|The Wind in the Willows]]'', a 2006 television adaptation of the [[Kenneth Grahame]] novel.

He has made appearances in ''[[Kath & Kim]]'' and ''[[Neighbours]]'' (the latter alongside [[David Walliams]] as ''[[Little Britain]]'' stalwarts [[Lou and Andy]], as well as a cameo role, playing 'Chris' or 'Jammy' at the wedding fayre, in the [[BBC Three]] sitcom ''[[Gavin & Stacey]]''. Lucas has co written (with Walliams) and performed in a new series of ''[[Little Britain USA]]'' for [[HBO]]. The pair are also writing a movie for [[Dreamworks]].

Lucas was the first celebrity to make an appearance in 2008's ''[[Big Brother Celebrity Hijack]]'' on [[E4 (channel)|E4]], working alongside Big Brother in a series containing housemates aged 18<U+2013>21 with various talents.

On 9 April 2009, the series ''[[Kr<U+00F6>d M<U+00E4>ndoon and the Flaming Sword of Fire]]'', featuring Matt Lucas as a regular performer, premi<U+00E8>red on [[Comedy Central]], the first major comedy series Lucas has done since ''[[Little Britain]]''. In 2010, Lucas played [[Tweedledee and Tweedledum]] in [[Tim Burton]]'s ''[[Alice in Wonderland (2010 film)|Alice in Wonderland]]'',<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117991998.html |title=Matt Lucas at Variety Players |date=10 September 2008 |author=Byron Perry}}</ref> alongside [[Mia Wasikowska]], [[Johnny Depp]], [[Helena Bonham Carter]] and [[Anne Hathaway (actress)|Anne Hathaway]].

On 3 October 2010, he is due to play the role of "Thenardier" in a special one-off performance of [[Les Mis<U+00E9>rables)]], to be held at the O2 Arena in London. The show will be in aid of the show's 25th Anniversary five days later.<ref>http://www.mirror.co.uk/celebs/news/2010/06/02/matt-lucas-and-nick-jonas-to-star-in-les-miserables-production-115875-22303568</ref>
