'''Cooperative gameplay''' (often abbreviated as '''co-op''') primarily refers to a feature in [[video games]] that allows players to work together as teammates with the absence of player-controlled competitors. Cooperative gameplay is usually built around the single player mode of a game, modified to allow additional players. Often the story is modified and the [[difficulty level]] is increased depending on the number of players in the game. Players assist other teammates in many ways: passing weapons or items, healing, and providing cover in a firefight are all advantages over single play.

Compared to competitive multiplayer, co-op gameplay has been less popular in video games, as replacing computer [[Game AI|AI]] with the capability for superior human opponents has tended to take priority. Technical limitations also hindered the increased action or graphics required for simultaneous co-op play, notably on early-generation home consoles. As controller and networking technology has developed, allowing for more games to allow more than two players on [[Personal computer|PC]]s and consoles, cooperative games gained in popularity, especially in [[first-person shooters]] and [[sports games]].

Since the Internet boom, PC game developers have shifted away from cooperative campaigns, instead opting to concentrate on adding competitive-based [[multiplayer]] modes for online play. 

==History==
===Arcades===
<!--  Commented out because image was deleted: [[Image:Arcade Mousers.gif|thumb|235px|Four-player action in ''[[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (arcade game)|Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles]]''.]] -->
The first video games to have a co-op mode were primarily arcade side-scrollers in the [[beat 'em up]] and [[shoot 'em up]] genres. One of the earliest famous examples was [[1985]]'s ''[[Gauntlet (arcade game)|Gauntlet]]'', a top-down action game allowing four different players, each an individual class, to work through the game's dungeon together. Another was ''[[Exed Exes]]'', also in 1985, a vertical scrolling shooter that allowed two to play simultaneously. 

[[1989 in video gaming|1989]] saw the release of two very popular titles, [[Capcom]]'s two-player cabinet, ''[[Final Fight]]'', and [[Konami]]'s ''[[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (arcade game)|Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles]]'', which allowed four players to fight simultaneously. Upon the release of these titles, the multiplayer beat 'em up became a very popular arcade genre. Many of these games were commercial tie-ins to existing comic book and cartoon franchises. 

Though other developers would attempt to cash in on the growing craze, both Capcom and Konami would be the forerunners, producing another arcade title almost every year. Capcom followed up their success with games such as ''[[Magic Sword]]'', ''[[Captain Commando]]'', and ''[[Alien vs. Predator (arcade game)|Aliens vs. Predator]]'', their final title in the genre being [[1996]]'s ''[[Dungeons & Dragons: Shadow over Mystara]]''. Konami put out a sequel to their ''[[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Turtles in Time|TMNT]]'' game, an oversized 6-player ''[[X-Men (arcade game)|X-Men]]'' cabinet, and a 4-player beat 'em up based on ''[[The Simpsons (arcade game)|The Simpsons]]'', among others. 

[[Data East]] was also a notable producer of co-op beat 'em ups such as ''[[Bad Dudes]]'' and ''[[Captain America and the Avengers]]''.

Though popular for several years, cooperative beat 'em ups would eventually become less popular as one-on-one [[Versus fighting game|fighting games]] such as ''[[Street Fighter II]]'' and ''[[Mortal Kombat (video game)|Mortal Kombat]]'' grew in popularity. One of the last arcade beat 'em ups to be released was [[Sega]]'s ''[[Zombie Revenge]]'' in [[1999]]. 

Cooperative scrolling shooters such as ''[[U.N. Squadron]]'' were also well known in arcades.

Sports games were also popular co-op games, as they were easily suited to have more than one player play together against the computer, or more often on 4-player cabinet setups for 2-on-2 play. ''[[NBA Jam]]'' was one of the most popular arcade sports titles of the early 1990s. Several [[World Wrestling Entertainment|WWF]] wrestling arcade games were also produced, as well as Capcom's ''[[Saturday Night Slam Masters]]''. However, cooperative sports gameplay would not become more widespread until later generations of home consoles with [[multitap]]s and four controller ports became standard.

===Home consoles===
Though consoles from the [[History of video game consoles (second generation)|second generation of video games]] onward typically had controller ports for two-player games, most systems did not have the computing or graphical power for simultaneous play, leading most games that billed "2-player gameplay" as feature to merely be the single player game, alternating players, with competitive multiplayer being less common. 

Many arcade beat 'em ups, such as ''[[Double Dragon]]'', were ported to less advanced systems. Alternating play replaced the arcade's co-op play in the [[Nintendo Entertainment System|NES]] version (although ''[[Double Dragon II: The Revenge|Double Dragon II]]'' and ''[[Double Dragon 3: The Rosetta Stone|III]]'' for the same system did retained their co-op gameplay, with the added feature of enabling or disabling friendly hits). Most other titles featuring 2-player were head-to-head sports titles. Though most of the console beat 'em ups were arcade ports, original franchises such as ''[[Streets of Rage]]'' and ''[[River City Ransom]]'' also became popular.

The [[run and gun]] genre was also popular for co-op games. ''[[Contra (arcade game)|Contra]]'', for instance, was far more successful in its NES incarnation than it was in the arcade, and is famous for being one of the most popular co-op games ever, and was followed up with several sequels. ''[[Gunstar Heroes]]'' for the [[Sega Genesis]] and the [[Metal Slug series|''Metal Slug'' series]] for the [[Neo Geo (console)|Neo Geo]] were also well-received titles. 
[[Image:Ratched deadlocked coop.jpg|thumb|left|235px|''[[Ratchet: Deadlocked]]'' features [[split screen (computer graphics)|split-screen]] co-op.]]
Co-op games in the [[console role-playing game|RPG]] genre have generally been less common on console systems. The [[1993]] action-RPG, ''[[Secret of Mana]]'' for the [[Super Nintendo]] offered two- and three-player action, once the main character had acquired his party members. ''[[Final Fantasy VI]]'' offered a form of alternating co-op play for its battles, with the second player taking control of half of the characters in the party. [[Namco]]'s [[Tales (role-playing game series)|''Tales'' series]] allowed multiple players to take control of individual members in its real-time battles in some of the titles, such as ''[[Tales of Symphonia]]'', while the [[Baldur's Gate: Dark Alliance]] games replicated the ''[[Diablo (computer game)|Diablo]]'' formula for consoles, offering 4-player simultaneous play through the game's campaign. 

[[Electronic Arts]] has arguably produced the most successful co-op titles in history, as their various sports franchises have been consistent best-sellers worldwide for over a decade. The original ''[[NHL Hockey]]'' and ''[[Madden NFL]]'' installments on the Sega Genesis were key games, allowing two players or more to play against the CPU. Installments of both series, among other official sports franchises developed by EA, are published annually. 

Many console games support [[split screen (computer graphics)|split screen]] displays in order to show 2 or more players in different regions of the game. Split screen displays would usually split the main screen into either 2 or 4 sub-regions so that 2-4 players could roam freely within the game world. Many [[first-person shooter|first-person]] and [[third-person shooter]] games use this technique when played in multiplayer co-op mode, such as the console versions of games in the [[Rainbow Six (computer game)|''Rainbow Six'' series]]. 

With the [[Nintendo 64]], having four controller ports started to become a standard feature in consoles, as the [[Dreamcast]], [[GameCube]] and [[Xbox]] all featured them. As larger multiplayer games became feasible, cooperative gameplay also became more available. The [[History of video game consoles (seventh generation)|latest generation]] of video game consoles all feature wireless controllers, removing the past local player limits. However, its effect on multiplayer is probably less pronounced than the advancement of console internet capabilities.

====Online services====
The rise of online services like [[Xbox Live]] has allowed cooperative gameplay on consoles to become available on more games. ''[[Gears of War]]'' was the first game to have all of the single player campaign availible to play online cooperatively on a games console. Then games like ''[[GTA IV]]'',  ''[[Crackdown]]'' and ''[[Halo 3]]'' featured cooperative gameplay online. The game offers the ability to invite players on the users<U+2019> friends list and have them instantly pop in (known as "Drop in, Drop out" gameplay) the player<U+2019>s game to help them out.

===PC===
The release of ''[[Doom (video game)|Doom]]'' in [[1993]] was a breakthrough in network gaming. Though arguably [[Deathmatch (gaming)|deathmatch]] was both the most influential and most popular mode, ''Doom'''s co-op gameplay was also significant. Up to four players could travel through the entire game together, playing on separate computers over a [[LAN]]. Unlike many co-op games, the game's campaign mode was designed primarily for [[single player]], but the difficulty was tweaked to compensate for extra human players. The following three games produced by [[id Software]] (''[[Doom II]]'', ''[[Quake]]'' and ''[[Quake II]]'') all featured co-op modes.

Since around the year 2000, most FPS developers have forsaken co-op campaign play, opting to focus more purely on either a more detailed and in-depth single player experience or a purely multiplayer game. Epic's ''[[Unreal Tournament]]'' series has practically eschewed single player altogether, and the most significant releases of ''[[Doom 3]]'', ''[[Quake 4]]'', and both ''[[Half-Life (video game)|Half-Life]]'' titles shipped without cooperative gameplay modes. The [[Mod (computer gaming)|moddability]] of these titles has enabled fan-created add-ons which enable co-op play in many of these cases, though.  
<!-- Image with inadequate rationale removed: [[Image:Baldursgate1.jpg|thumb|225px|right|''[[Baldur's Gate]]'' is an in-depth [[Dungeons & Dragons|D&D]] simulation supporting up to six cooperative players.]] -->
Co-op still exists in the form of competitive teamplay, which has generally overtaken deathmatch as the dominant form of online FPS multiplayer, with titles such as ''[[Counter-Strike]]'', ''[[Battlefield 1942]]'' , ''[[Medal of Honor series|Medal of Honor]]'' and ''[[Call of Duty]]'' gaining dominance in the early to mid-2000s. 

[[Serious Sam]] and [[Serious Sam II]], both first-person shooters by [[Croteam]] concentrated heavily on the co-op gameplay.

[[Blizzard Entertainment]]'s ''[[Diablo (computer game)|Diablo]]'' was immensely successful, largely due to being the flagship title of Blizzard's online matchmaking service, [[battle.net]]. Though local network play was an option, the game's popularity came from its internet play, allowing many players to fight through the entire single player campaign together. 

Most early [[computer role-playing game]]s were inspired by ''[[Dungeons & Dragons]]'', but restricted to single player due to technical restrictions. The earliest RPGs featuring co-op were [[MUD]]s which would eventually became the [[MMOG]] genre, though it is debatable and variable if and how much these online worlds are designed around cooperative gameplay, depending on the rules of the virtual space. 

Later PC RPGs became more powerful and flexible in simulating the shared real life RPG experience, allowing players to collaborate in games over the Internet. The D&D-sanctioned ''[[Baldur's Gate]]'' and ''[[Icewind Dale]]'' games allowed up to 6 players to play through the campaign mode over network.

[[2000]]'s ''[[Vampire: The Masquerade - Redemption]]'' was the earliest CRPG to feature an online mode where a "storyteller" controlled a campaign much like a [[Dungeon Master]], shaping and altering the game world against a party of human-controlled players. Atari's ''[[Neverwinter Nights]]'' was an official and comprehensive D&D simulator, featuring even more robust game-creation tools and developing a sizable online community. Besides an active modding community providing many fan-developed campaigns, the game was officially followed up with several commercial expansion packs.

==Gameplay characteristics==
===Resource management===

A common concept in cooperative games is the sharing of resources between players. For example, two players managing one team in a [[real-time strategy]] game, such as ''[[StarCraft]]'', will often have to draw off the same pool of resources to build and upgrade their units and buildings. The sharing of resources, however, can be as simple as the system used in the ''[[Contra series|Contra]]'' games (and other shoot-'em-up/beat-'em-up games) where a player who is out of spare lives could "steal" a life from the other player so both players could continue to play at the same time.

===Platform games===
In cooperative [[platform game]]s or games that use similar elements, both players occupy the same screen and must coordinate their actions, particularly in respect of the scrolling. If the scrolling is limited to forward directions only, players can potentially cause the death of each other. For example, one player lagging behind could cause problems for his partner, as the screen will not scroll onward. A slow player could be fatal to his partner's attempt to complete a jump over a chasm, if say the chasm appeared on the screen but the ending surface however did not. In the vertical levels, one player can scroll up far too quickly and inadvertently kill the other player in the process, as the other player would literally have the ground beneath him disappear.
===Sports games===
==Local & Network Co-op mode==
Co-op video games feature a multiplayer co-op mode which allow multiple local or network players to team up while playing the single player story. Local players either share input devices or use multiple controllers connected to a single console. Network co-op players join an existing game running on a game server via a computer network. These networks can vary from [[local area network]]s to [[wide area network]]s.

Due to the complexity of video game coding, co-op games rarely allowed network players and local players from mixing. If there were 2 local players playing a co-op game, a network player would not be able to join that game in progress.

==Game Ending==
Many co-op games feature a different ending when completed with multiple players. These games would sometimes not show the full ending, but rather a subset or short ending. The player would be required to complete the game in single player mode to view the complete ending.
''[[Bubble Bobble]]'', on the other hand, was the other way around: both players had to survive co-op mode to get the good ending.

Some co-op games even feature a new ending when completed in co-op mode. This new ending is unlocked only when players work as a team to complete the game. This ending is sometimes customized to suit the characters which were used to complete the game. This increases the replay value of the game. Many [[beat 'em up]] games on console employ this method to increase replay value. One such game, Streets of Rage, even allowed co-op players to fight to the death at the end of the game. 

Other games, such as [[Unreal]], are modified by server administrators to restart after the single-player ending sequence; in some cases, the contents of the inventory of the players are also retained.
