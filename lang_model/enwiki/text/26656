'''PBY Catalina''' was the [[United States Navy]] designation for an [[United States|American]] and [[Canadian]]-built [[flying boat]] of the [[1930s]] and [[1940s]]. ''PB'' stands for Patrol Bomber, with ''Y'' being [[Consolidated Aircraft]]<U+2019>s manufacturer identification. It could be equipped with [[depth charge]]s, [[bomb]]s, [[torpedo]]es, and [[M2 machine gun|.50 caliber machine guns]] and was one of the most widely used multi-role aircraft of [[World War II]]. Catalinas served with every branch of the [[US military]] and in the air forces and navies of many other nations. In the [[United States Army Air Forces]] and later in the [[USAF]] [[Strategic Air Command]] their designation was the '''OA-10''' while Canadian-built PBYs were known by the nickname '''Canso'''.

==Background==
[[Image:PBY 5A Catalina.jpg|right|thumb|PBY Catalina riding to a sea anchor.]]
In World War II, PBYs were used as [[ASW|anti-submarine warfare]] aircraft, [[patrol bomber]]s, [[Convoy#Naval convoys|convoy]] escorts, [[search and rescue]] aircraft, and [[cargo aircraft|transports]]. The Catalina can be considered the most successful aircraft of its kind, as no other flying boat was produced in greater numbers. The last active military Catalinas were not retired from service until the [[1980s]]. Even today, over seventy years after its first flight, the aircraft continues to fly as an airtanker in [[aerial firefighting]] operations all over the world.

The Catalina was originally designed to be a patrol bomber, an aircraft with a long operational range intended to locate and attack enemy transport ships at sea in order to compromise enemy [[supply line]]s. With a mind to a potential conflict in the [[Pacific Ocean]], where troops would require resupply over great distances, the US Navy in the [[1930s]] invested millions of dollars in developing long-range flying boats for this purpose. Flying boats had the advantage of not requiring [[runway]]s to take off and land, in effect having the entire ocean available as its runway. Several different flying boats were adopted by the Navy, but the PBY Catalina was the most widely used and produced.

Although slow and ungainly, Catalinas distinguished themselves in World War II as exceptionally reliable aircraft. [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] armed forces used them successfully in a wide variety of roles that the aircraft was never intended for. They are remembered most by veterans of the war for their role as rescuing aircraft, where they saved the lives of thousands of aircrewmen shot down over the Pacific Ocean.

==Prototyping and development==
As American dominance in the Pacific Ocean began to face competition from Japan in the 1930s, the [[U.S. Navy]] contracted Consolidated Aircraft and [[Douglas Aircraft Corporation]] in October [[1933]] to build competing [[prototype]]s for a patrol flying boat. Naval doctrine of the 1930s and [[1940]]s used flying boats in a wide variety of roles that today are handled by multiple special-purpose aircraft. The US Navy had adopted the [[Consolidated P2Y]] and [[Martin P3M]] models for this role in [[1931]], but both aircraft proved to be underpowered and hampered by short ranges and low maximum payloads.

Consolidated and Douglas both delivered single prototypes of their designs, the XP3Y-1 and XP3D-1, respectively. Consolidated's XP3Y-1 was an evolution of the XPY-1 design that had originally competed unsuccessfully for the P3M contract two years earlier and of the XP2Y design that the Navy had authorized for a limited production run. Although the Douglas aircraft was a good design, the Navy opted for Consolidated's prototype because the projected cost was only $90,000 per plane.

[[Image:PBY cat.jpg|right|thumb|PBY Catalina in flight.]]
[[Image:PBY Gun Blister.jpg|right|thumb|PBY waist gunner mounting port side gun blister.]]
Consolidated's XP3Y-1 design (designated "Model 28" within the company) was revolutionary in many ways. The aircraft had a [[parasol wing]] with internal bracing that allowed the wing to be a virtual [[Cantilever#In aircraft|cantilever]], except for two small [[streamline]]d struts on each side. Stabilizing floats that could be retracted in flight to form streamlined wingtips were another aerodynamic innovation. The two-step hull design was similar to that of the P2Y, but the Model 28 had a cantilever [[cruciform tail]] unit instead of a strut-braced [[twin tail]]. Cleaner aerodynamics gave the Model 28 improved performance compared to earlier designs.

The powerplant for the prototype was comprised of two 825 hp (615 kW) [[Pratt & Whitney R-1830|Pratt & Whitney R-1830-54]] Twin Wasp [[engine]]s mounted on the wing<U+2019>s leading edges. Armament comprised four 0.30 in (7.62 mm) [[Browning Model 1919 machine gun|Browning machine guns]] and up to 2,000 lb (907 kg) of bombs.

The XP3Y-1 had its first flight on [[28 March]] [[1935]] after which it was transferred to the US Navy for service trials. The XP3Y-1 soon proved to have significant performance improvements over current patrol flying boats. The US Navy requested further development in order to bring the aircraft into the category of ''patrol-bomber'', and in October [[1935]] the prototype was returned to Consolidated for further work. The work included installation of 900 hp (671 kW) R-1830-64 engines. For the redesignated XPBY-1, Consolidated introduced redesigned vertical tail surfaces. XPBY-1 had its maiden flight on [[19 May]] [[1936]], during which a record non-stop distance flight of 3,443 miles (5,541 km) was achieved.

The XPBY-1 was delivered to US Navy Squadron VP-11F in October [[1936]]. The second squadron to be equipped was Squadron VP-12, which received the first of its aircraft in early [[1937]]. The second production order was placed on [[25 July]] [[1936]]. Over the next three years, the PBY design would be gradually improved and successive models introduced.

<small>* Approximately 4051 Catalinas, Cansos, GSTs and other variants were produced between June 1937 and May 1945 on non-US Navy contracts for the [[United States Army Air Forces|USAAF]], [[US Coast Guard]], Allied nations, and civilian customers.</small>

===Naval Aircraft Factory production===
The [[Naval Aircraft Factory]] made significant modifications to the PBY design, many of which would have significantly interrupted deliveries had they been incorporated on the Consolidated production lines.<ref name=janes2>{{Ref Jane's|The Naval Aircraft Factory Catalina|247}}</ref> The new aircraft, officially known as the '''PBN-1 Nomad''', had several differences from the basic PBY. The most visually apparent upgrades were to the bow, sharpened and extended two feet, and to the tail, which was enlarged and featured a new shape. Other improvements included larger fuel tanks, increasing range by 50%, and stronger wings permitting a 2,000 lb (908 kg) heavier gross weight. An auxiliary power unit was installed, along with a modernized electrical system, and the weapons were upgraded with continuous-feed mechanisms.<ref name=janes2/>

The majority (138) of the 156 PBN-1s produced served with the Russian Navy. The remaining 18 aircraft were assigned to training units at [[NAS Whidbey Island]] and [[NAF Newport]].<ref name=aeroweb>{{cite web | url=http://aeroweb.brooklyn.cuny.edu/specs/naf/pbn-1.htm | title=Naval Aircraft Factory PBN-1 Nomad | work=Aviation Enthusiast Corner | accessdate=2006-03-31}}</ref> Later, improvements found in the PBN-1 <U+2013> notably, the larger tail <U+2013> were incorporated into the amphibious PBY-6A.

==Distribution to the Allies==
{{seealso|List of PBY Catalina operators}}
===Australia===
[[Image:3OTU (AWM 128145).jpg|thumb|A formation of Australian Catalinas in 1943 (AWM 128145)]]
The [[Royal Australian Air Force]] ordered its first PBY-5 Catalinas in 1940. By the end of the war the RAAF had taken delivery of 168 Catalinas. The RAAF used Catalinas in a wide range of roles including reconnaissance and anti-submarine patrols, offensive mine-laying and air-sea rescue. In addition, RAAF Catalina aircraft were used to transport Australian personnel back to Australia at the end of the war. The RAAF retired its last Catalina aircraft in 1952.<ref>[http://www.defence.gov.au/raaf/raafmuseum/research/aircraft/series2/A24.htm A24 Consolidated PBY Catalina], [[RAAF Museum]]</ref>

===Canada===
[[Canada]] had its own close associations with the Catalina, both as a manufacturer and customer. Under an agreement reached between the Canadian and US governments, production lines were laid down in Canada, by [[Boeing Aircraft of Canada]] (as the '''PB2B-1''') in [[Vancouver]], and by [[Canadian Vickers]] ('''PBV-1''') at the [[Canadair]] plant in [[Cartierville]]. Canadian aircraft were known as the <U+201C>Canso<U+201D>.<ref name=janes/>

===New Zealand===
[[New Zealand]] used Catalinas from 1942 to replace the [[Short Singapore]] with the [[Royal New Zealand Air Force]]'s [[No. 5 Squadron RNZAF|5 Squadron]] and [[No. 6 Squadron RNZAF|6 Squadron]], operating in the South Pacific initially out of [[Hobsonville]] and [[Fiji]] on maritime patrol and air-sea rescue roles. In the battle of the Atlantic [[No. 490 Squadron RNZAF|490 (NZ) Squadron]] operated Catalinas in the anti submarine role out of [[Jui]] in East Africa. When [[Short Sunderland]] MR Mk 5s replaced the New Zealand Catalinas, one of the ex-RNZAF machines was transferred to [[TEAL]] and made pioneering air survey flights throughout the Pacific. The [[Royal New Zealand Air Force Museum]] is restoring an RNZAF Catalina. An airworthy Catalina in 6 Squadron markings is privately owned.

===Soviet Union===
The [[Soviet Union]] had shown an interest in the aircraft and this resulted in an order for three aircraft and the negotiation of a licence to build the type in Russia. When these three machines were delivered they were accompanied by a team of Consolidated engineers who assisted in establishment of the Russian production facilities. This aircraft model, designated the "GST", was powered by two [[Mikulin]] M-62 [[radial engines]] with a power rating of 900 to 1,000 hp (671 to 746 kW). The first of these GSTs was put into service towards the end of 1939. It is estimated that hundreds more were put into service with the Soviet navy. Russia also received 137 of the PBN-1 Nomad variant of the Catalina built by the Naval Aircraft Factory in Philadelphia along with 48 PBY-6As under the [[Lend-Lease]] Act .

===United Kingdom===
The British [[Air Ministry]] purchased a single aircraft for evaluation purposes, the Model 28-5. This was flown across the [[Atlantic Ocean]] to the Marine Aircraft Experimental Establishment at [[Felixstowe]] on the East Anglian coast of [[England]] in July [[1939]]. With the outbreak of war anticipated, the trials were terminated prematurely, and an initial 50 aircraft were ordered under the designation "Catalina I". These aircraft were similar to the US Navy's PBY-5s except for the installation of British armament. The name "Catalina" had been used by Consolidated for their commercial sales prior to the British order, and was eventually adopted by the US Navy on [[October 1]] [[1941]].<ref name=janes/>

Initial deliveries of the [[Royal Air Force]]'s Catalinas began in early [[1941]] and these entered service with [[No. 209 Squadron RAF|No. 209]] and [[No. 240 Squadron RAF|No. 240]] squadrons of [[Coastal Command]]. In all, nine squadrons of Coastal Command were equipped with the Catalina, as were an additional 12 squadrons overseas. The total acquisition was approximately 700 spread over the following designations: Catalina Mk I, Mk IA (PBY-5A amphibian in RCAF service only), Mk IB, Mk II, Mk III, Mk IVB (Canadian built PBY-5, the PB2B-1), Mk IV, and Mk VI (a PBN-1 style tall tail version built in Canada). The Catalina Mk V which would have been PBN-1s were a cancelled order.

In British service the Catalina was fitted with .303 inch guns, typically a [[Vickers K]] at the front and [[Browning Model 1919 machine gun|Browning MGs]] in the waist positions. Some received the [[Leigh light]] to aid anti-submarine warfare by night.

Between 1940 and 1945 seven former RAF examples were used by [[BOAC]] (two for a Poole to Lagos service), and [[Qantas]] (five for a Ceylon to Perth service).

===Other nations===
[[Image:Catalinas in the aleutians.jpg|thumb|right|A flight of PBY-5s over the Aleutian Islands.]]
Soon after the receipt of Britain's first order for production aircraft, a [[France|French]] purchasing mission ordered 30 aircraft in early 1940. Allocated the Consolidated identification Model 28-5MF, none of these were delivered before the [[Battle of France]].

Other orders received around the same time covered 18 aircraft for the [[Royal Australian Air Force]], some of which would be used to re-establish the British-Australian airlink through Asia (see [[Order of the Double Sunrise]]), and 48 ordered by the Netherlands for use in the [[Dutch East Indies]]. Other Catalina operators were [[Argentina]], [[Brazil]], [[Chile]], the [[Dominican Republic]], [[Ecuador]], [[France]], [[Indonesia]], [[Israel]], [[Mexico]], [[Netherlands]], [[Netherlands East Indies]], [[Norway]], [[Peru]], [[South African Air Force|South Africa]], [[Taiwan]], [[Uruguay]].

==Roles in World War II==
[[Image:PBY Catalina.jpg|thumb|A civilian fire-bomber Catalina|right]]
The final construction figure is estimated at around 4,000 aircraft, and these were deployed in practically all of the operational theaters of World War II. The Catalina served with distinction and played a prominent and invaluable role in the war against the Japanese. This was especially true during the first year of the War in the Pacific, because the Catalina and the Boeing [[B-17 Flying Fortress]] were the only two aircraft with the range necessary for these operations. As a result they were used in almost every possible military role until a new generation of aircraft became available.

===Anti-submarine warfare===
Catalinas were the most extensively used anti-submarine warfare (ASW) aircraft in both the [[Second Battle of the Atlantic|Atlantic]] and [[Pacific War|Pacific Theaters]] of the Second World War. One of their jobs was escorting convoys to [[Murmansk]]. By 1943 [[U-boat]]s were well armed with anti-aircraft guns and two [[Victoria Cross]]es were won by Catalina skippers pressing home attacks on U-boats in the face of heavy fire: [[John A. Cruickshank]] in 1944 against [[U-347]] and in the same year Flight Lt. [[David Hornell]] [[RCAF]] (posthumously) against [[U-1225]]. Nearly 40 U-boats in total were lost to Catalinas.

===Maritime patrol===
In their role as patrol aircraft, Catalinas participated in some of the most notable engagements of World War II. The aircraft's parasol wing and large waist blisters allowed for a great deal of visibility; this combined with its long range and endurance made it well suited for the task.

===Night attack and naval interdiction===
Several squadrons of PBY-5As and -6As in the Pacific theater were specially modified to operate as night convoy raiders. Outfitted with state-of-the-art [[magnetic anomaly detector|magnetic anomaly detection gear]] and painted flat black, these "Black Cats" attacked Japanese supply convoys at night. Catalinas were very successful in this highly unorthodox role. Between August [[1943]] and January [[1944]], Black Cat squadrons had sunk 112,700 tons of merchant shipping, damaged 47,000 tons and damaged 10 Japanese warships. The [[Royal Australian Air Force]] also operated Catalinas as night raiders, with RAAF aircraft mounting mine-laying operations deep into Japanese-held waters. The RAAF also occasionally used Catalinas to mount nuisance night bombing raids on Japanese bases, including the major base at [[Rabaul]].

===Search and rescue===
[[Image:USAFCatalina.jpg|right|thumb|A US Army Air Forces OA-10 Catalina and her crew.]]
Catalinas were employed by every branch of the US military as rescue aircraft. Catalinas continued to function in this capacity for decades after the end of the war.

==Employment in peacetime==
With the end of the war, flying boat versions were quickly retired from the US Navy, but amphibious versions remained in service for many years. The last Catalina on active service for the US military was a PBY-6A operating with a Naval Reserve squadron. She was retired in 1967.<ref>Scarborough, William & Sewell, Joe (1995). ''Walk Around: PBY Catalina''. Carrollton, TX: Squadron/Signal Publications. ISBN 0-89747-357-4.</ref> The Catalina subsequently equipped the world's smaller armed services, in fairly substantial numbers, into the late [[1960s]].

The [[USAF]] [[Strategic Air Command]] had PBY Catalinas (OA-10 Catalinas) in service from `1946 through 1947.
 
Of the few dozen remaining airworthy Catalinas, the majority are in use today as [[aerial firefighting]] planes.

==Catalina affair==
{{main|Catalina affair}}
A Swedish military Catalina was shot down by Soviet aircraft over the [[Baltic Sea]] in June [[1952]] while investigating the earlier crash of a Swedish [[Douglas DC-3]].
