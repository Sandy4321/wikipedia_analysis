'''Downtown Cleveland''' is the [[central business district]] of the City of [[Cleveland]] and [[Northeast Ohio]]. Reinvestment in the area in the mid-1990s spurred a rebirth that continues to this day, with over $2 billion in residential and commercial developments slated for the area over the next few years. While much of the city's population decamped to surrounding suburbs in the second half of the 20th century, downtown Cleveland gained population in the first decade of the 21st century,<ref>[http://planning.city.cleveland.oh.us/census/factsheets/spa15.html City of Cleveland Planning Commission], 2000</ref> growing from 7,261 in 1990 to 9,599 as of the [[United States Census, 2000|2000 Census]]. In 2005, the [[Brookings Institution]] called it one of America's "Emerging Downtowns" because of its 32.2% growth over the period. As of the [[United States Census, 2010|2010 Census]] the population of Downtown Cleveland was 11,693 making it the biggest downtown district in [[Ohio]]. <ref>{{cite journal | url=http://www.brookings.edu/metro/pubs/20051115_birch.htm | title=Who Lives Downtown | first=Eugenie L. | last=Birch | publisher=[[Brookings Institution]] | month=November | year=2005 | pages=15 | accessdate=2007-12-27}}</ref> 



== Public Square ==

{{main|Public Square}}

[[Image:clevedowntown.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Superior Avenue near Public Square]]
The heart of downtown and the city's first settled area, [[Public Square]] was laid out by city founder [[Moses Cleaveland]] in 1796 and has remained largely unchanged.<ref>Cleveland: A Concise History, 1796-1996 (pg 7),  1997</ref>  It consists of a large open space, cut into quadrants by Ontario Street and Superior Avenue.  Public Square is the symbolic heart of the city, and has hosted presidents, vast congregations of people, and a free annual [[Independence Day (United States)|4th of July]] concert by the [[Cleveland Orchestra]].  At one time, Public Square was fenced off and inaccessible to vehicles. In 1860, the Perry Monument, a memorial to Commodore [[Oliver Hazard Perry]]'s victory in the [[Battle of Lake Erie]] in the [[War of 1812]], was dedicated in the center of Public Square.  In 1892, it was moved out of the square, which by then had the fences removed after lobbying by commercial interests.  Public Square is also home to the [[Soldiers' and Sailors' Monument (Cleveland)|Soldiers' and Sailors' Monument]], which commemorates residents of [[Cuyahoga County, Ohio|Cuyahoga County]] who served in the [[American Civil War|Civil War]]. Public Square also features a statue of Cleaveland; a statue of [[Tom L. Johnson]], the city's most famous mayor; a large amount of shrubbery and other landscaping; and a large public fountain.<ref>[http://ech.case.edu/ech-cgi/article.pl?id=PS6 Encyclopedia of Cleveland History: Public Square].

== Flats district ==
{{main|The Flats}}
[[Image:Cuyahoga river at Cleveland.jpg|thumb|left|250px|The Flats]]
Once the most popular nightlife district in Ohio, [[The Flats]] have fallen on hard times. Though there is no one reason for the decay, a series of incidents have garnered a reputation for unruly behavior. The Flats crowd migrated east to the Warehouse and the Gateway Districts as trendy and more upscale venues have emerged. The west bank of the flats, home to numerous restaurants, bars, and new housing continues to thrive, and is the site of a large urban apartment/condo complex known as Stonebridge. A local developer, Scott Wolstein of Developers Diversified Realty is demolishing the structures on the east bank and replacing them with a new mixed-use neighborhood, and the flats will be reborn once again as a residential neighborhood. The Flats were the place [[Moses Cleaveland]] first landed when he founded the city, and thus the area is reclaiming its past heritage as a residential area.  In addition to the East Bank development, there have been plans floated for the [[Irishtown Bend]] area, in addition to more housing on the west bank in the area near the Powerhouse entertainment complex, currently a large surface parking lot.

The long-suffering entertainment district on the east bank of the Flats is planned to be reborn in a proposal put forth by Scott Wolstein of Developers Diversified Realty, Inc.  Wolstein's plans include a complete demolition of the current east bank, realignment of Old River Road, and the construction of hundreds of apartments, townhouses, and retail over parking, connections to the RTA [[Waterfront Line]], and a new office building that is being pitched as the new home for the local [[Defense Finance and Accounting Service]] office, scheduled to add over 500 jobs in Cleveland over the next two years.<ref>The Plain Dealer, Metro B1.  April 25, 2006.</ref>  The development will also include a boardwalk and marina, and is part of a larger plan to develop the lakefront and river shores of downtown that has included a large number of apartments built on the west bank of the flats, in an area called Stonebridge.  The east bank redevelopment plan was approved and the developer is currently demolishing properties on the riverfront.<ref>The Plain Dealer, Metro B1.  March 1, 2007.</ref>  Current East Bank property owners were offered an appraised amount for their property, with the owners who refuse to sell subject to [[eminent domain]] proceedings by right of the [[Cleveland-Cuyahoga County Port Authority]].  

{{As of|2007|5}}, there are several holdout property owners currently fighting the Port and Wolstein on the prices offered for their properties.<ref>The Plain Dealer, Metro B3.  May 8, 2007.</ref> Wolstein has announced that former Browns quarterback [[Bernie Kosar]] will be developing a steakhouse in his development, as well as a bookstore and movie theater.  He also said he is close to getting a "gourmet" grocery.  The latest East Bank plan also incorporates a formerly-separate project on land at West 10th Street, called "Lighthouse Landing".  The former owner of this parcel, currently a surface parking lot, sold the property to Wolstein's group previously.<ref name = bernie>Gomez, Henry J.  "Bernie cooking in the flats".

On May 22, 2007, Wolstein and Bob Corna, developer of the West Bank's Stonebridge neighborhood, announced a partnership to unite Wolstein's East Bank plan with Corna's Stonebridge Development, and debuted a new development plan for the neighborhood (pictured).  There will be several large pedestrian bridges built over the Cuyahoga River, and the developers intend to market the area as "The Flats", without regard to east/west, as they have stated the rest of the country still knows the area by its full name.<ref name = bernie />  Home to condominium towers known as Stonebridge, the developers of this project wish to extend high-rise towers throughout the west bank area on current surface parking lots, eventually building out to several thousand housing units on the West Bank, in addition to the several hundred included in Wolstein's East Bank Proposal.<ref>The Plain Dealer, Page One.

===Avenue District===

Cleveland has also added to its higher income downtown housing with the Avenue District.<ref> {{cite web | url = http://theavenuedistrict.com/welcome/home/ | title = Cleveland Condos / The Avenue District | accessdate = 2010-09-02 | publisher = Zaremba Homes}}</ref> Located immediately east of [[Erieview Tower]] on the site of several parking lots on East 12th Street, the development includes over 400 condominiums, including lofts, townhomes, penthouses, street-level retail, garage parking, and pedestrian friendly sidewalks and streets.  The developer is touting this as downtown's new upscale, quiet neighborhood with easy access to the attractions and amenities of downtown.  The development is a project of Zaremba, Inc., and construction began in 2006.<ref> {{cite web | url = http://theavenuedistrict.com/pressroom/press-releases/19/ | title = Press Releases / The Avenue District | accessdate = 2010-09-02 | publisher = Zaremba Homes | quote = CLEVELAND - Sept. 21, 2006 - Zaremba, Inc., developer of The Avenue District, a $250-million-plus residential development in downtown Cleveland, will officially break ground Friday, Sept. 29, at 1211 St. Clair Ave., on the northeast corner of East 12th Street and St. Clair Avenue. Mayor Frank Jackson will join Nathan Zaremba, president of Zaremba, for an 11 a.m. ceremony, which is open to the public and will be followed by a catered reception. }}</ref> The Avenue District will be built in phases, with future surface lot development based on market demand.

===East 4th Street===

MRN Ltd has bought most of the buildings along East 4th Street and is currently installing street retail such as high-end clothing, restaurants and coffee shops with outdoor seating, hundreds of loft apartments in the upper levels, and an upscale martini bar/bowling alley/restaurant created by the founders of Gameworks, called the Corner Alley.<ref>The Plain Dealer, Business C1.  August 31, 2006.</ref>  MRN will be adding more apartments to the area in conjunction with the Corner Alley martini bar/bowling alley, with funding assistance from the City of Cleveland.

East 4th Street is home to Pickwick and Frolic, the comedy club/restaurant Hilarities 4th Street Theatre, the House of Blues Cleveland (located in the former Woolworth's Building), the restaurant Lola Bistro (owned by chef [[Michael Symon]], winner of the ''[[Iron Chef America]]'' competition), the East Coast-style "ultralounge" View Nightclub,<ref>[http://www.east4thstreet.com/lifestyleAttractions.php East 4th Street: Attractions].  Accessed May 12, 2007. {{Wayback | url=http://www.east4thstreet.com/lifestyleAttractions.php <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> | date=20071009012444 }}</ref> Saigon Vietnamese Cuisine, and Zocalo Mexican Grill & Tequileria. The restaurant La Strada opened in October 2008.  The Greenhouse Tavern and Erie Island Coffee Co. of [[Kelleys Island, Ohio]] are set to open in 2008.

===Lakefront===
<!--  Commented out because image was deleted: [[Image:CleHarborfront.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Lakefront Plan Rendering.]] -->
In 2004, The Cleveland City Planning Commission completed plans for a lakefront revitalization to stimulate national interest in the City of Cleveland as an exciting place to live.<ref>The Plain Dealer, Page One.  December 18, 2004.</ref> These include thousands of housing units, retail shops, public parks, connections to the [[light rail]] waterfront line, an 18 hole [[golf]] course, office buildings, a boardwalk, and other amenities.<ref>The Plain Dealer, "Lakefront could get housing, cable cars; Plan will be unveiled at meeting tonight".  March 24, 2004</ref> Cleveland's current industrially-oriented lakefront is slated to become a thing of the past, and a new, public-minded and recreational lakefront will rise in its place. The chief roadblock to the implementation of this plan is the relocation of the Port of Cleveland to an area west of the river, as well as converting of Ohio Route 2, better known as the [[Cleveland Memorial Shoreway]] to a low-speed, at-grade boulevard. The Shoreway is currently an expressway that currently blocks downtown from the lakefront, separating lakefront developments and reducing pedestrian access. The boulevard will enable substantially more intersections with north-south streets stretching from Edgewater Park at the city's western border through downtown and east to Gordon Park.<ref>[http://www.innerbelt.org/Lakefrontwest/LakefrontProjectOverview.htm Lakefront West: Plan Overview].</ref>

===Convention Center===
Cleveland is working on a long term replacement for its outdated [[Public Auditorium|convention center]], currently located underground beneath [[The Mall (Cleveland)|Mall B]], a grassy open space stretching from North Coast Harbor through the Civic Center District.<ref>The Plain Dealer, "Report in hand, convention panel breaks out sales pitch; New study promises new jobs, tax revenue".  May 4, 2005.</ref>  Plans vary from replacing the current center beneath the mall to construction of an addition to [[Forest City Enterprises|Forest City]]-owned [[Tower City Center]].<ref name=autogenerated1 />  Cost projections have put the underground site at an estimated cost of over $500 million dollars, which is well over what the city and county wish to pay.  Forest City, who had withdrawn its Tower City site from consideration, has proposed that the location be reconsidered.<ref>The Plain Dealer, "Tower City won<U+2019>t be convention site; County office choice kills plan, owners say" June 7, 2005.</ref><ref>The Plain Dealer, "Tower City site again on agenda for center; Forest City reverses itself on its property as convention site", Sept 2, 2005.</ref>  The site is considered a front runner as it would cost around $350 million to expand a convention center onto it, a figure closer to the city/county budget.<ref>The Plain Dealer, "Two convention center sites being evaluated", Sept 14, 2005.</ref>

===Others===
In Public Square, a large surface parking lot will be the new site of a 21-story office tower being built by the Richard E. Jacobs Group.<ref>[http://blog.cleveland.com/business/2008/05/jacobs_hines_to_build_21story.html Jacobs, Hines to build 21-story office tower on Public Square - Cleveland Business News <U+2013> The Latest Breaking News, Earnings Reports and Stories from The Plain Dealer<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>  515 Euclid Avenue, a parking garage, is slated to become a 28+ story condominium tower.<ref>[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0EIN/is_2005_August_1/ai_n14840911 Business Wire, August 1 2005.]</ref>  Tower City Center continues to attract downtown shoppers, and Forest City Enterprises says they are waiting for the downtown housing market to mature before it plans housing developments on its Scranton Peninsula, across the [[Cuyahoga River]] from Tower City.<ref>The Plain Dealer, "Reviving the peninsula; Forest City dusts off Scranton plans to snare convention center", July 26, 2003.</ref>

Additional developers have floated ideas for developing the peninsula and areas surrounding the Flats with housing as well; in particular, local developer John Ferchill has announced plans to build housing along the river's edge at Scranton.  The project will represent Ferchill's first project in Cleveland in many years, as he refused to work with previous Mayor [[Michael R. White]].<ref>The Plain Dealer, "Notching victories in rust belt; Developer Ferchill Group finds fertile ground in aging big cities", Feb 21, 2006.</ref>  [[Quicken Loans]], owned by Cavaliers owner [[Dan Gilbert (businessman)|Dan Gilbert]], has opened a large online loan center downtown near the arena, with hopes to employ over 600 people when fully staffed.<ref>The Plain Dealer, "Gilbert throws '$1 billion' party; Quicken owner rewards workers for reaching mortgage sales mark", Feb 8, 2007.</ref> New housing condo/apartment projects are frequently announced, and Cleveland is projected to increase its downtown population to over 20,000 by 2010.
