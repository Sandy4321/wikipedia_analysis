{{AFC comment|1=As you will no doubt notice, I have severely cut down this draft to remove much of the unsourced/promotional/[[WP:PRIMARY|PRIMARY]] material. However, this has left the draft with a few sections (specifically the Research section) with very few references. In order to get this draft approved, I believe that at least one [[WP:reliable source|reliable source]] per paragraph of the research section is necessary. So find four good sources that talk about her research, ping me, and I will be happy to accept it. [[User:Primefac|Primefac]] ([[User talk:Primefac|talk]]) 20:56, 30 March 2015 (UTC)}}

{{AFC comment|1=I'm unsure which statements reviewers think are likely to be challenged and therefore must be explicitly attributed with inline citations. Another approach to the problem would be to trim non-essential information from the draft. It's quite common for academics to serve on the editorial boards of journals, for example, so does the reader really learn anything about Martinez-Conde by listing these - particularly when one has a editorial board of 1,300+ and another has an editorial board of 6,000+? Remember that this is not a CV. [[User:Worldbruce|Worldbruce]] ([[User talk:Worldbruce|talk]]) 02:03, 29 March 2015 (UTC)}}

{{AFC comment|1=This inline citations decline is basically the same reason as below. Still some statements without sources. Also, the layout of this article isn't ideal.

{{AFC comment|1=As a [[WP:BLP|biography of a living person]] there needs to be a supporting reference for all content. You have a number of sourced paragraphs that have additional unsourced content follwing the reference. An example is ''where she directs the Laboratory of Integrative Neuroscience. She serves on the editorial boards of the scientific journals PLOS ONE, Journal of Eye Movement Research, PeerJ, and Frontiers in Human Neuroscience'' which follows an inline citation but is unsupported by a reliable source '''<font color="blue">[[User:Flat Out|Flat Out]]</font>'''&nbsp;'''''<span class="smallcaps" style="font-variant:small-caps;color:red">[[User talk:Flat Out|let's discuss it]]</span>''''' 00:41, 27 March 2015 (UTC)}}

{{AFC comment|1=A biography of a living person needs an inline citation for every paragraph, at minimum.  It's tedious, sorry, but please see the corresponding wikipedia policy [[WP:BLP]].

'''Susana Martinez-Conde''' (born October 1, 1969) is a neuroscientist and science writer.  She is a professor of ophthalmology, neurology, and physiology & pharmacology at the State University of New York, [[Downstate Medical Center]], where she directs the Laboratory of Integrative Neuroscience. She directed laboratories previously at the [[Barrow Neurological Institute]] and [[University College London]].<ref name=suny>{{cite web |url=http://www.downstate.edu/ophthalmology/faculty/martinez-conde.html |title=Department of Ophthalmology Faculty - Susana Martinez-Conde, PhD |work=SUNY Downstate Medical Center |accessdate=March 12, 2015}}</ref> Her research bridges perceptual, [[cognitive]], and oculomotor [[neuroscience]]. She is best known for her studies on illusions, eye movements and perception, neurological disorders, and attentional misdirection in stage magic. 

==Early life and education==
Martinez-Conde was born in 1969 in [[A Coru<U+00F1>a]], Spain, to a merchant sailor father and a stay-at-home mother. Her maternal grandfather survived the sinking of the ''[[SS Castillo de Olite|Castillo de Olite]]'' in 1939, during the Spanish Civil War.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Salas |first1=Carlos |last2=Salas |first2=Deva |date=February 3, 2014 |title=El hundimiento de los 1.476 ahogados |trans-title=The Sinking of the 1.476 Drowned |url=http://www.elmundo.es/cronica/2014/03/02/5311cf5de2704e237a8b456f.html |language=es |newspaper=El Mundo |accessdate=March 12, 2015}}</ref>

Martinez-Conde majored in experimental psychology at the Universidad Complutense de Madrid in 1992, and obtained her PhD in medicine and surgery from the neuroscience program at the Universidade de Santiago de Compostela in 1996.<ref name=BNL>{{cite web |url=http://www.bnl.gov/newsroom/news.php?a=11673 |title= Visual Neuroscientist Susana Martinez-Conde to Talk on 'Neuromagic' at Brookhaven Lab, 10/23 |date=14 October 2014 |work=Brookhaven National Laboratory}}</ref> She received the Spanish Ministry of Education's First National Prize for Termination of University Studies (Primer Premio Nacional de Terminaci<U+00F3>n de Estudios Universitarios) in 1993, awarded to the graduating student with highest academic scores in the country in each major.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}  She received her postdoctoral training from the Nobel Laureate Prof. [[David Hubel]] at Harvard Medical School,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sciencewriters2011.org/speakers/susana-martinez-conde-phd.html |title=Susana Martinez-Conde, PhD |work=Science Writers 2011}}</ref> where she was later an Instructor in Neurobiology.

==Career==
In 1997, Martinez-Conde moved to the United States to work at Harvard Medical School with David Hubel. She became an Instructor in Neurobiology at this institution in 2001. She then moved to the United Kingdom, as a Lecturer in Ophthalmology and laboratory director at University College London. In 2004, she returned to the United States as an assistant professor, and later, associate professor, at the Barrow Neurological Institute in Phoenix, Arizona, where she directed the Laboratory of Visual Neuroscience. In 2014, she moved to Brooklyn, New York, as Professor of Ophthalmology, Neurology, and Physiology & Pharmacology at SUNY Downstate Medical Center,<ref name=suny/> where she directs the Laboratory of Integrative Neuroscience.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://smc.neuralcorrelate.com/people/ |title=People {{!}} Laboratory of Integrative Neuroscience |work=SUNY Downstate Medical Center}}</ref>

==Scientific research==
Much of Martinez-Conde's research focuses on how our brains create perceptual and cognitive illusions in everyday life. She has studied the Rotating Snakes illusion, Isia Leviant's Enigma illusion,<ref>http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2008/11/081120183733.htm</ref>  Victor Vasarely's Nested Squares illusion, Troxler fading and other types of perceptual fading illusions, and various perceptual and attentional illusions in stage magic. Martinez-Conde created the Best Illusion of the Year Contest in 2005,{{citation needed|date=March 2015}} and writes the Illusions column for ''Scientific American: Mind''.<ref name=stories>{{cite web |url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/author/susana-martinez-conde/ |title=Stories by Susana Martinez-Conde |work=Scientific American}}</ref>

Martinez-Conde studies the effects of attention on visual perception, and the neural bases of attention and visual awareness. Her research on visual awareness has concentrated on the neural bases of perceptual fading, visual masking, and attentional misdirection in stage magic.  Martinez-Conde has pioneered the study of stage magic techniques from a neuroscience perspective.<ref>http://www.jgh.ca/uploads/Psychiatry/Articles%20PDF/Magic1-Published.pdf</ref> She has proposed that neuroscientists and magicians share many overlapping interests, and that both disciplines should collaborate with one another to mutual advantage.

Martinez-Conde has researched the connection between art and visual science, as well as the mechanisms underlying the perception of art. She has studied the neural bases of kinetic illusions in [[Op art]],<ref>http://www.bbc.com/future/bespoke/story/20150130-how-your-eyes-trick-your-mind/index.html</ref> and discovered novel visual illusions based on the artworks of [[Victor Vasarely]].

Martinez-Conde has researched the interactions between eye movements, vision and perception, both in the healthy brain and in neural disease. She investigates how small, involuntary eye movements called microsaccades affect perception and visual processing.<ref>http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0042698910005924</ref> She also studies how neurological disease affects eye movements in order to gain a better comprehension of the disorders and aid their differential and early diagnosis.

==Bibliography==
In addition to being a regular contributor to ''[[Scientific American]]'', Martinez-Conde has co-authored two books:
*{{cite book|last1=Macknik|first1=Stephen L.|last3=Blakeslee|first3=Sandra|first2=Susana|last2=Martinez-Conde|title=Sleights of mind : what the neuroscience of magic reveals about our everyday deceptions|date=2011|publisher=Picador|location=New York|isbn=0312611676|edition=1st Picador ed.}}
