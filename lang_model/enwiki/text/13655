Mr. Krabs discovers a lot people are visiting the beach, so he decided to go to sell them Krabby Patties. When [[SpongeBob SquarePants (character)|SpongeBob]], [[Squidward Tentacles|Squidward]], and Mr. Krabs are on a surfboard, they meet up with [[Patrick Star|Patrick]] and [[Sandy Cheeks|Sandy]]. Patrick tries to climb onto the board, but he causes it to tip, it collides and sweeps the five friends up into separate places: SpongeBob, Patrick and Squidward go to an island with young surfers, Mr. Krabs ends up stranded in the middle of the sea with his cash register "Cashie", and Sandy is taken to a small island where she built a helicopter from the supplies.

SpongeBob, Patrick and Squidward are told by the young surfers in the island that the only way to get back to Bikini Bottom is to surf there; unfortunately they do not know how to. Twitch, one of the surfers, tells them that there is one person who can teach them how to surf, Jack Kahuna Laguna. After they find the where is Jack Kahuna Laguna, he comes out of his hut and surfs on an enormous surfboard which astonishes the three. He later says that they have to ride a wave called "The Big One", in order to get back home. They practice surfing for some time, then get ready to ride "The Big One". Before they set off, Jack Kahuna Laguna announces that the Big One demands a sacrifice.

SpongeBob, Patrick, and Squidward ride the wave and they see Mr. Krabs. He jumps up onto the board and drops Cashie into the ocean, so Jack Kahuna Laguna goes to retrieve it and acts as the sacrifice. SpongeBob, Patrick, Mr. Krabs, and Squidward are seen flying on the surfboard and approach Goo Lagoon. Sandy's helicopter crash-lands in Goo Lagoon. A welcome party has been thrown for SpongeBob, and Jack Kahuna Laguna returns with Cashie, which he returns to Mr. Krabs.
