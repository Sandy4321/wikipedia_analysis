"'''My Back Pages'''" is a song written by [[Bob Dylan]] and included on his 1964 [[album]] ''[[Another Side of Bob Dylan]]''.  It is stylistically similar to his earlier [[Folk music|folk]] [[protest song]]s and features Dylan's voice with an [[acoustic guitar]] accompaniment.  However, its lyrics<U+2014>in particular the [[refrain]] "Ah, but I was so much older then/I'm younger than that now"<U+2014>have been interpreted as a rejection of Dylan's earlier personal and political idealism, illustrating his growing disillusionment with the [[American folk music revival|1960's folk]] [[Protest|protest movement]] with which he was associated, and his desire to move in a new direction.  Despite having been written in 1964, the song was not performed live by Dylan until 1988. 

"My Back Pages" has been [[Cover version|covered]] by artists as diverse as [[Keith Jarrett]], [[The Byrds]], the [[Ramones]], [[The Nice]], [[Steve Earle]], and [[The Hollies]].  The Byrds' version, which was initially released on their 1967 album ''[[Younger Than Yesterday]]'', was also issued as a single in 1967, and proved to be the band's last [[Top 40]] [[Hit single|hit]] in the U.S.

==Writing, recording and performance==
Bob Dylan wrote "My Back Pages" in 1964 as one of the last songs<U+2014>perhaps the last song<U+2014>that he composed for his ''Another Side of Bob Dylan'' album.<ref name=heylin>{{cite book|title=Revolution in the Air: The Songs of Bob Dylan 1957-1973|author=Heylin, Clinton|pages=206&ndash;208|year=2009|publisher=Chicago Review Press|isbn=1-55652-843-4}}</ref>  It was recorded on June 9, 1964, under the [[working title]] of "Ancient Memories", and was the last song to be [[Magnetic tape sound recording|committed to tape]] for the album.<ref name=heylin/>  The song was partly based on the traditional [[Folk music|folk song]] "[[The Trees They Grow So High (folk song)|Young But Growing]]"<ref name=heylin/> and has a mournful [[melody]] similar to that of "[[The Lonesome Death of Hattie Carroll]]" from Dylan's previous album, ''[[The Times They Are a-Changin']]''.<ref name=shelton>{{cite book|title=No Direction Home|author=Shelton, Robert|page=221|year=1986|publisher=Da Capo Press|isbn=0-306-80782-3}}</ref>  As with the other songs on ''Another Side'', Dylan is the sole musician on "My Back Pages" and plays in a style similar to his previous protest songs, with a sneering, rough-edged voice and a hard-strumming acoustic guitar accompaniment.<ref>{{cite book|title=Bob Dylan: The Recording Sessions 1960&ndash;1994|author=Heylin, Clinton|pages=28&ndash;32|year=1995|publisher=St. Martin's Griffin|isbn=0-312-15067-9}}</ref><ref name=prophet>{{cite book|title=Bob Dylan: Prophet, Mystic, Poet|author=Rogovoy, S.|page=70|year=2009|publisher=Scribner|isbn=978-1-4165-5915-3}}</ref>

In the song's lyrics, Dylan criticizes himself for having been certain that he knew everything and apologizes for his previous political preaching, noting that he has become his own enemy "in the instant that I preach."<ref name=shelton/><ref name=keys/><ref name=rough/>  Dylan questions whether one can really distinguish between right and wrong, and even questions the desirability of the principle of equality.<ref>{{cite book|chapter="Far Between Sundown's Finish and Midnight's Broken Toll": Enlightenment and Postmodernism in Dylan's Social Criticism|title=Bob Dylan and Philosophy|editor=Vernezze, P. & Porter, C.|author=Rocheleau, J.|pages=69&ndash;70|year=2006|publisher=Open Court|isbn=0-8126-9592-5}}</ref> The lyrics also signal Dylan's disillusionment with the 1960s protest movement and his intention to abandon protest songwriting.<ref name=keys/><ref name=rough>{{cite book|title=The Rough Guide to Bob Dylan|author=Williamson, Nigel|edition=2nd|pages=39, 171, 220|year=2006|publisher=Rough Guides, Ltd|isbn=1-84353-718-4}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=Song & Dance Man III: The Art of Bob Dylan|author=Gray, Michael|pages=4, 119|year=2000|publisher=Continuum|isbn=0-8264-5150-0}}</ref>  The song effectively analogizes the protest movement to the establishment it is trying to overturn.<ref name=prophet/>  One of the song's most famous lines is the refrain:

:''Ah, but I was so much older then
:''I'm younger than that now

Music critic [[Robert Shelton (critic)|Robert Shelton]] has interpreted this refrain as "an internal dialogue between what he [Dylan] once accepted and now doubts."<ref name=shelton/>  Shelton also notes that the refrain maps a path from [[William Blake|Blakean]] experience to the innocence of [[William Wordsworth]].<ref name=shelton/>  The refrain has also been interpreted as Dylan celebrating his "bright, new post-protest future."<ref name=rough/>

Dylan's disenchantment with the protest movement had previously surfaced in a speech he had given in December 1963 when accepting an award from the [[Emergency Civil Liberties Committee]] (ECLC) in New York.<ref>{{cite web|title=Bob Dylan and the NECLC|publisher=Corliss Lamont Website|url=http://www.corliss-lamont.org/dylan.htm|accessdate=2009-12-29}}</ref>  Author [[Mike Marqusee]] has commented that "No song on ''Another Side'' distressed Dylan's friends in the movement more than 'My Back Pages' in which he transmutes the rude incoherence of his ECLC rant into the organized density of art. The lilting refrain ... must be one of the most lyrical expressions of political apostasy ever penned. It is a recantation, in every sense of the word."<ref>{{cite book|author=Marquesee, Mike|pages=105<U+2013>106|year=2003|title=Chimes of Freedom: The Politics of Bob Dylan's Art|publisher=New Press|isbn=1-56584-825-X}}</ref>  

In an interview with the ''Sheffield University Paper'' in May 1965, Dylan explained the change that had occurred in his songwriting over the previous twelve months, noting "The big difference is that the songs I was writing last year ... they were what I call one-dimensional songs, but my new songs I'm trying to make more three-dimensional, you know, there's more symbolism, they're written on more than one level."<ref>{{cite news|author=De Yong, Jenny|coauthors=Roche, Peter|title=Bob Dylan|newspaper=Sheffield University Paper|location=Sheffield|year=1965|date=May 1965|url=http://www.interferenza.com/bcs/interw/65-apr30.htm|accessdate=2009-12-29}}</ref>  In late 1965, Dylan commented on the writing of "My Back Pages" specifically during an interview with Margaret Steen for ''The Toronto Star'': "I was in my New York phase then, or at least, I was just coming out of it. I was still keeping the things that are really really real out of my songs, for fear they'd be misunderstood. Now I don't care if they are."<ref name=heylin/>  As Dylan stated to [[Nat Hentoff]] at the time that "My Back Pages" and the other songs on ''Another Side of Bob Dylan'' were written, "There aren't any finger pointing songs [here] ... Now a lot of people are doing finger pointing songs.  You know, pointing to all the things that are wrong.  Me, I don't want to write for people anymore.  You know, be a spokesman."<ref name=heylin/>

Dylan did not play "My Back Pages" in [[Rock concert|concert]] until June 11, 1988, during a performance in [[Mountain View, California]].<ref name=heylin/>  The [[arrangement]] that Dylan used eliminated some of the song's [[Verse (popular music)|verses]] and included an [[electric guitar]] part performed by [[session musician]] [[G. E. Smith]].<ref name=heylin/>  Since 1988, Dylan has played the song in concert many times in both electric and semi-acoustic versions, and sometimes as an acoustic [[Encore (concert)|encore]].<ref name=heylin/><ref name=keys>{{cite book|title=Keys to the Rain|author=Trager, Oliver|pages=444&ndash;445|year=2004|publisher=Billboard Books|isbn=0-8230-7974-0}}</ref>  At the 30th Anniversary Tribute Concert to Dylan at [[Madison Square Garden]] in 1992, Dylan performed "My Back Pages", in the Byrd's arrangement, with [[George Harrison]], [[Eric Clapton]], [[Tom Petty]], [[Neil Young]], and [[Roger McGuinn]].<ref name=prophet/>  This performance, which featured vocals from all six musicians, along with [[guitar solo]]s by Clapton and Young, was released on ''[[The 30th Anniversary Concert Celebration]]'' album in 1993.<ref>{{cite web|title=The 30th Anniversary Concert Celebration|url={{Allmusic|class=album|id=r184195|pure_url=yes}}|publisher=[[Allmusic]]|accessdate=2010-03-14}}</ref>

In addition to its initial appearance on ''Another Side of Bob Dylan'', "My Back Pages" has also appeared on a number of Bob Dylan [[compilation album]]s.  In the United States and Europe, it appeared on the 1971 album ''[[Bob Dylan's Greatest Hits Vol. II]]'' (aka ''More Bob Dylan Greatest Hits'') and on the 2007 album ''[[Dylan (2007 album)|Dylan]]''.<ref name=covers>{{cite web|title=My Back Pages cover versions|publisher=[[Allmusic]]|url=http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=17:2952412~2~T000|accessdate=2009-08-09}} {{Dead link|date=January 2011|bot=CactusBot}}</ref>  In Australia, the song was included on the 1994 compilation album ''Greatest Hits Vol. 3''.<ref name=covers/>

===The Byrds' version===
The American [[Rock music|rock]] [[Musical ensemble|band]] [[The Byrds]] released a recording of "My Back Pages" on February 6, 1967, as part of their fourth album, ''[[Younger Than Yesterday]]''.<ref name="timeless">{{cite book|author=Rogan, Johnny|pages=544<U+2013>546|year=1998|title=The Byrds: Timeless Flight Revisited|edition=2nd|publisher=Rogan House|isbn=0-9529540-1-X}}</ref>  The title of ''Younger Than Yesterday'' was itself directly inspired by the song's refrain of "Ah, but I was so much older then/I'm younger than that now."<ref>{{cite book|author=Hjort, Christopher|page=119|year=2008|title=So You Want To Be A Rock 'n' Roll Star: The Byrds Day-By-Day (1965-1973)|publisher=Jawbone Press|isbn=1-906002-15-0}}</ref>  "My Back Pages" was subsequently issued as a [[Single (music)|single]] by The Byrds on March 13, 1967, with the version included on the single being a [[radio edit]] that omitted the song's second verse, in order to reduce the playing time from 3:08 to 2:31.<ref name="timeless"/><ref name="timeless2">{{cite book|author=Rogan, Johnny|page=207|year=1998|title=The Byrds: Timeless Flight Revisited|edition=2nd|publisher=Rogan House|isbn=0-9529540-1-X}}</ref>  The single reached #30 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] but failed to chart in the United Kingdom.<ref name="whitburn">{{cite book|author=Whitburn, Joel|page=130|year=2008|title=Top Pop Singles 1955-2006|publisher=Record Research Inc|isbn=0-89820-172-1}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|author=Brown, Tony|page=130|year=2000|title=The Complete Book of the British Charts|publisher=Omnibus Press|isbn=0-7119-7670-8}}</ref>  "My Back Pages" was the last single by The Byrds to reach the Top 40 of the U.S. charts.<ref name="whitburn"/>

The song was initially suggested as a suitable vehicle for the band by their manager Jim Dickson.<ref>{{cite book|author=Hjort, Christopher|page=125|year=2008|title=So You Want To Be A Rock 'n' Roll Star: The Byrds Day-By-Day (1965-1973)|publisher=Jawbone Press|isbn=1-906002-15-0}}</ref>  [[Lead guitar]]ist [[Roger McGuinn|Jim McGuinn]] felt that it would make an effective [[cover version]], but [[David Crosby]], the band's [[rhythm guitar]]ist, felt that covering another Dylan song was formulaic.<ref name="byrdwatcher">{{cite web|title=Younger Than Yesterday|publisher=ByrdWatcher: A Field Guide to the Byrds of Los Angeles|url=http://ebni.com/byrds/lpyty.html|accessdate=2009-08-09}}</ref>  The Byrds had already released a total of six Dylan covers on their first two albums, ''[[Mr. Tambourine Man (album)|Mr. Tambourine Man]]'' and ''[[Turn!
