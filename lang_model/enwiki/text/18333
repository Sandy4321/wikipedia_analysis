'''Leland Tower''' is a twenty-two story tall building located on Stolp Island in [[Aurora, Illinois]]. 

Stolp Island is recognized as a [[Historic district (United States)|Historical District]] by the [[National Register of Historical Places]]. Leland Tower was at one time the tallest building in Illinois outside of Chicago and dominates the downtown of Aurora, dwarfing all the other buildings located there. The tower was at first built as a hotel, but has since taken on the roll of apartment complex. The building was built in 1928 and designed by Anker Sveere Graven and Arthur Guy Mayger. The top of Leland Tower once housed a club known as the Sky Club, where recordings were made by such famous blues musicians as [[Sonny Boy Williamson I|John Lee "Sonny Boy" Williamson]]. As a side note, the tower is also believed by many to be haunted as a result of multiple suicides that have been committed there by people jumping from windows of the tower into the [[Fox River (Illinois River tributary)|Fox River]].
