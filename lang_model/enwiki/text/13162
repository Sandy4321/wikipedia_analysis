[[S-Bahn]] trains in [[Munich]] are operated by '''S-Bahn M<U+00FC>nchen''', a subsidiary of [[Deutsche Bahn]] Regio Bavaria. The Munich S-Bahn network is integrated in the [[Munich Transport and Tariff Association]] (M<U+00FC>nchner Verkehrs- und Tarifverbund, MVV). Together with the [[Munich U-Bahn|U-Bahn]], it is the backbone of Munich's public transport system.

The Munich S-Bahn commenced operation on [[28 May]] [[1972]]. It's construction was speeded up as part of the scheme to provide an adequate transportation system during the [[1972 Summer Olympics|Olympic Summer Games]] held in [[Munich]] in September [[1972]] and as a means of upgrading transportation in the Munich conurbation. The system was created by connecting the suburban rail services from the west of the city with those to the east, by means of a tunnel section from Hauptbahnhof in the west to Ostbahnhof in the east (so-called "core" route).

== Data ==

* 10 S-Bahn lines
* 442 km tracks
* 147 S-Bahn stations
* 238 S-Bahn electric multiple unit trains
* ca. 750.000 passengers per working day
* [[Computer Integrated Railroading]] on the "core" route

== Lines ==

=== System ===

The network has seven arms in the West, which are simply numbered from S1 (to [[Freising]]) to S8 (Geltendorf) (there is no S3). These are coupled with the five arms in the East according to technical necessities, which results in the numbering of the Eastern arms.

In addition, the two lines not going through the core route tunnel have two-digit numbers like S2''x''. Further, the non-electrified line to Altom<U+00FC>nster is called line '''A'''.

==History==

An underground railway line for Munich was first proposed in [[1928]] in a report on the "relocation of traffic centres". An underground route would allow "direct long distance traffic to and through the city centre".

On [[22nd May]] [[1938]], the first tunnel, which was part of the north-south route, was started in the Lindwurmstra<U+00DF>e, between the present-day subway stations Sendlinger Tor and Goetheplatz. In the speech of [[Julius Dorpm<U+00FC>ller]], the general director of [[Deutsche Reichsbahn-Gesellschaft|Deutsche Reichsbahn]], the project was called "S-Bahn" for the first time. Due to [[World War II]] the construction and plans for the Munich S-Bahn were set aside.

In [[1965]], the [[Federal Republic of Germany]], the Free State of [[Bavaria]], the state capital of [[Munich]] and the [[Deutsche Bundesbahn]] signed a contract on the construction of the Munich S-Bahn. The further development was most influenced by a decision made in [[Rome]] on [[26th April]] [[1966]]: The [[International Olympic Committee]] chose Munich over [[Detroit]], [[Madrid]] and [[Montreal]] as the scene for the [[1972 Summer Olympics]]. This resulted in a tight schedule: There were only six years to complete the Munich S-Bahn network.

Not only did the tunnel through the city centre have to be built, the full railway infrastructure had to be expanded. The network of suburban lines had to be changed over and modernised. A large number of stations had to be upgraded; the platforms were brought to a length of 210 m to allow for three-unit trains; the platform height was raised to 76 cm. However, the floor height of the trains used then and now is at ca. 1 m, which makes boarding difficult for people with disabilities or perambulators. Tunnel stations and platforms updated recently where no freight trains run feature a height of 96 cm, however.

On [[25th February]] [[1971]] the topping-out ceremony could be celebrated in the core route tunnel. In May the first S-Bahn train of the [[DB Class 420|ET 420]] series was put into service on the route between [[Pasing]] and [[Gauting]]. On [[1st September]] [[1971]] a regular advance service was started on that route.

On [[28th May]] [[1972]], the Munich S-Bahn network was finally put into service with 360 km of tracks and 101 trains of the ET 420 series. It was the first time a S-Bahn network that size was put into service on a single date. The route S10 to [[Wolfratshausen]] (today S7) was operated with conventional push-pull trains from the southern wing of Munich Central Station. It was electrified later and connected to the core route after the construction of a 260 m tunnel crossing the large number of mainline rail tracks leading to Munich Central Station.

Three months later the German President [[Gustav Heinemann]] opened the [[1972 Summer Olympics]]. During the Games there were two additional S-Bahn lines servicing the now-defunct station Olympiastadion (Olympic Stadium). The new S-Bahn system stood the test and transported 3.18 million passengers in 7,138 runs to and from the sports sites in only 17 days.

Since then the Munich S-Bahn network has been expanded multiple times. In [[1992]], the route between [[Ismaning]] and the new [[Munich International Airport|Airport Munich II]] has been put into service. Until 2005, there was a 266 million Euro programme to substantially extend the infrastructure. For example, the route Giesing-[[Deisenhofen]] has been upgraded with a second track. Since [[2000]], trains of the type series [[DB Class 420|ET 420]] have been gradually replaced by [[DB Class 423|ET 423]] trains.

Further dates:
* [[15th June]] [[1966]] - Construction of the core route tunnel begins in Arnulfstra<U+00DF>e.
* [[28th April]] [[1972]] - first test runs on the tunnel route (Hauptbahnhof-Marienplatz-Ostbahnhof).
* [[28th May]] [[1972]] - regular service with 360 route km begins.

== Type Series ==
* [[DB Class 423|ET 423]] (since [[2000]])
* [[DB Class 628|VT 628]] (on line A, which is not electrified)

[[Image:S-Bahn Muenchen Type 420.jpg|thumb|ET 420]]
[[Image:S-Bahn Hannover Type 423.jpg|thumb|ET 423]]
No longer in service:
* [[DB Class 420|ET 420]] ("Olympia train", [[1972]] to [[2004]])

==Plans and further expansions==

* Second core route: Nearly all lines use the trunk route, which results in a bottle-neck responsible for long delays on even the smallest disruptions. It is planned to build a second tunnel through the city centre, which will be about 10 km and is supposed to be finished in [[2011]]. It will start between the stations Laim and Donnersbergerbr<U+00FC>cke and lie north of the current tunnel. Just before Munich East it will fork with one fork going to Munich East and the other one going to Leuchtenbergring. In between, only two stations, Central Station and Marienhof (slightly north of Marienplatz) are planned. The tunnel was chosen over another variant to build an S-Bahn along the railway "south ring".

* Extension of S7 to [[Geretsried]]. (''till 2009'')
* [[Erding]] ring: connection of the ends of S1/S8 (airport) and S2 East (Erding) (''planned, till 2009/2010'')
* relocation of the S2 East to the Munich International Trade Fair site with station (''Messestadt-Nord''?)
* upgrade of the ''Sendling Connection Route'' between Pasing and Heimeranplatz.
* new station ''Berduxstra<U+00DF>e'' between Obermenzing and Laim (S1/S2 West).
* new station ''Friedenheimer Br<U+00FC>cke'' between Laim and Donnersberger Br<U+00FC>cke (all lines except S1, S2 and S7).
* new station ''Menterschwaige'' between Solln and Deisenhofen (S20, S27).
* upgrade of ''Line A'' between ''Dachau'' and ''Altom<U+00FC>nster'' (''till 2008'')
