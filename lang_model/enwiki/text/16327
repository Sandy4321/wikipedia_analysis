'''''Intimacy''''' is the third [[studio album]] by British [[indie rock]] band [[Bloc Party]]. It was recorded in two weeks at several locations in London and [[Kent]] during 2008 and was [[record producer|produced]] by [[Paul Epworth]] and [[Jacknife Lee]]. Inspired by the release options available in the Internet age, the band members made the album available for purchase on their website as a [[digital download]] on 21&nbsp;August 2008. Minimal promotion was undertaken in the UK. The record was released in compact disc form on 24&nbsp;October 2008, with [[Wichita Recordings]] as the primary label. It peaked at number 8 on the [[UK Albums Chart]] and entered the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] in the United States at number&nbsp;18.

Bloc Party wanted to create an album that further distanced the band from the traditional rock set-up by incorporating more [[electronic music|electronic]] elements and unconventional musical arrangements. As the record's title suggests, its tracks are about personal relationships and are loosely based on one of [[frontman]] [[Kele Okereke]]'s breakups in 2007. Three songs were released as [[single (music)|singles]]: "[[Mercury (song)|Mercury]]", "[[Talons (song)|Talons]]", and "[[One Month Off]]"; the first two tracks entered the [[UK Top 40]]. ''Intimacy'' was generally well received by critics. Reviewers often focused on its rush-release and central theme, and considered them either bold steps or poor choices.

== Origins and recording ==

Bloc Party's second album ''[[A Weekend in the City]]'', released in 2007, allowed the quartet to evolve sonically by including more electronically tampered soundscapes,<ref name=jonze>{{Cite news |author = Jonze, Tim|title=Depression alienation promiscuity drug-taking fear anger self-gratification...|work=[[NME]]|page=20|date=3 February 2007}}</ref> but the band members were not entirely comfortable with more daring musical arrangements when making the record. According to multi-instrumentalist [[Gordon Moakes]], the impromptu November 2007 single "[[Flux (song)|Flux]]" "opened a door to the fact that we could go in any direction" in future works.<ref name=indie/>  After the ''NME'' Big Gig in February 2008,<ref name=BBCL>{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/newsbeat/hi/music/newsid_7771000/7771027.stm|title=Bloc Party singer not 'content'|author=Cochrane, Greg |publisher=[[BBC]]|date=8 December 2008|accessdate=8 August 2009}}</ref> the band members took a month off from touring and did not interact with each other during that period.

According to Okereke, Bloc Party wanted to make something as stylised as [[contemporary R&B|R&B]] or [[electronica]],<ref name=dummy>{{cite web |url=http://www.dummymag.com/features/2009/02/16/bloc-party-i-feel-like-we-could-do-anything-/ |title=Bloc Party "I Feel Like We Could Do Anything" |author=Cottingham, Chris |work=Dummy|accessdate=18 May 2009}}</ref> combining the rawness of ''Silent Alarm'' and the recording experience gained from ''A Weekend in the City''.<ref name=Age>{{cite web |url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/entertainment/music/party-hearty/2008/10/23/1224351405755.html?page=fullpage#contentSwap2|title=Party hearty |author=Northover, Kylie|work=[[The Age]]|date=24 October 2008|accessdate=18 May 2009}}</ref> The frontman drew inspiration from [[Siouxsie & the Banshees]]<U+2019> 1988 song "[[Peek-a-Boo (song)|Peek-a-Boo]]" and aimed to create "rock interpretations of {{nowrap|dance".<ref name=nb/><ref name=Age/>}} The band members worked together by initially performing [[sound check]]s with only guitar [[chord (music)|chords]], [[keyboard (instrument)|keyboard]] notes, and drum beats.<ref name=nb/> They decided to record the first ten tracks crafted after judging first ideas to often be the best.<ref name=Fender/> The band "thrived" under the pressure of timed sessions, which lasted only two weeks.<ref name=BBCL />

Moakes has indicated that there was no worry about whether a song could be recreated live in concert in the same way as it would appear on record.<ref name=canint/> A [[brass section]] and a [[chamber choir]] were hired as additional musicians.<ref name=inlay/> [[Drum machine]]s and [[distortion|distorted]] guitars were used more extensively than in Bloc Party's previous works to create a sense of manipulation to the basic rock palette.<ref name=dummy/> Drummer Matt Tong was initially sceptical of moulding songs with programmed drums, as opposed to using his physical output, but agreed to the idea when the band recorded some of the tracks in their entirety.<ref name=txt/> On some songs, the guitars were disregarded and the band focused solely on the beat.

== Promotion and release == 

After the studio sessions, Bloc Party embarked on a tour of North American and European summer festivals.<ref name=Fender/> One of the recorded tracks, "Mercury", was released as a single on 11&nbsp;August 2008 and peaked at number&nbsp;16 on the [[UK Singles Chart]].<ref name=nmeaug>{{cite web |url=http://www.nme.com/news/bloc-party/37906|title=Bloc Party unveil surprise new single on radio|work=[[NME]]|date=7 July 2008|accessdate=18 July 2009}}</ref><ref name=everyhit/> At the time, the band confirmed the existence of further material, but noted that a record release date was scheduled for the end of 2008 at the earliest.<ref name=nmeaug/> Bloc Party unexpectedly announced the completion of ''Intimacy'' on 18&nbsp;August 2008 via a [[webcast]] and confirmed a release within 60&nbsp;hours.<ref name=billb>{{Cite news |author = Paine, Andre|title=New Clicks On The Bloc|work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|page=39|date=30 August 2008}}</ref> The band members wanted to revive the importance of a new album's release in an era in which the excitement has dissipated because of extensive Internet coverage.<ref name=Scotsint/> They were inspired by [[Radiohead]]'s marketing of ''[[In Rainbows]]'' in 2007, but did not consider a "free" sale option.<ref name=RSint>{{cite web |url=http://www.rollingstone.com/rockdaily/index.php/2008/08/20/bloc-partys-kele-okereke-on-intimacy-the-surprise-breakup-album-10-people-knew-about/ |title=Bloc Party's Kele Okereke on the New Album "10 People Knew About" |author=Phull, Hardeep |work=[[Rolling Stone]]|date=20 August 2008|accessdate=18 May 2009}}</ref> Little press was undertaken in the UK to promote the record because of Okereke's reluctance to discuss personal aspects of his life.<ref name=dummy/>

=== Lyrics ===
The lyrics of ''Intimacy'' were inspired by a relationship breakup Okereke went through at the end of 2007. The lyricist told ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', "I wouldn't want anyone to think it's the clich<U+00E9>d break-up record but I haven't written about true, personal experiences all that much in the past."<ref name=RSint/> The move to more intimate subject matter was "semi-conscious" because the band members did not want to focus on socio-political issues as they had in their previous works.<ref name=canint/> Three tracks allude to [[Greek mythology]]: "Ares" draws its name from the [[Ares|god of war]], "Trojan Horse" is named after the [[Trojan Horse|Trojan War military ruse]], and "Zephyrus" draws its name from the [[Zephyrus|god of the west wind]].<ref name=inlay/> The narrative in the songs occurs between two people and focuses on the relations between lovers, friends, and enemies; Okereke indicated that "it's about moments of shared vulnerability".<ref name=dummy/> "Better Than Heaven" references the [[Garden of Eden]] and [[1 Corinthians 15|Corinthians (15:22)]],<ref name=inlay/> because the lyricist wanted to explore the themes of sex and death, especially in a biblical context.<ref name=dummy/>

}}

"Biko" means "Dear" in [[Igbo language|Igbo]]<U+2014>a language spoken in Nigeria, the homeland of Okereke's parents<U+2014>and is used "when you're beseeching someone to do something". Okereke denied that it is about the murdered South African anti-[[apartheid]] protester [[Steve Biko]].  The lyrics of "One Month Off" reference feelings of anger and are about being in love with someone younger and unfaithful, while "Zephyrus" concerns an apology following neglect.<ref name=Scotsint /> The lyrics in the chorus of "Ion Square", the last track on the original download release, are based on [[E. E. Cummings]]' poem "I Carry Your Heart with Me".<ref name="inlay"/> Okereke considers the song a personal favourite because it evokes the initial exciting stages of a new relationship when everything is going right.<ref name=RSint />

=== Composition ===
Okereke has discussed a natural progression in Bloc Party's compositional style to a more explorative, electronic direction.<ref name=nb>{{cite web |url=http://herenb.canadaeast.com/music/article/418500|title=Talking Bloc during Harvest Jazz|author=O'Kane, Josh |work=[Here] New Brunswick|date=18 September 2008|accessdate=17 July 2009}}</ref> For the opening track on ''Intimacy'', "Ares", the frontman was inspired to [[rap]] his lyrics after listening to the [[old school hip hop]] of [[Afrika Bambataa]].<ref name=Fender/> According to Heather Phares of [[Allmusic]], the song includes siren-like guitar chords and loud, complex drumming in the vein of [[dance music|dance]] acts [[The Prodigy]] and [[The Chemical Brothers]].<ref name=AMG>{{cite web |url=http://allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=10:hzfyxzqkld6e |title= Intimacy: Bloc Party |author=Phares, Heather |publisher=[[Allmusic]] |accessdate=18 May 2009}}</ref> "Mercury" continues the complex drumming theme by incorporating layered percussion and contains a vocally manipulated chorus.<ref name=sheetmusic /> The track is an attempt at [[drum and bass]] and features [[brass (instrument)|brass]] [[consonance and dissonance|dissonance]],<ref name=Fender/><ref name=sheetmusic /> effects Okereke has called "harsh, glacial, layered and energetic".<ref name=billb/> "Zephyrus" begins with a solitary vocal line accompanied only by a drum machine pattern,<ref name=sheetmusic/> while the [[Exmoor Singers]] provide [[background vocals]] in the rest of the composition.<ref name=inlay/> "Signs" is the only song that does not include guitars;<ref name=sheetmusic/> instead, it is made up of a [[synthesiser]] [[pulse (music)|pulse]] and [[multitrack recording|multitracked]] [[sample (music)|samples]] of [[glockenspiel]] and [[mbira]] resembling the work of [[minimalist music|minimalist]] composer [[Steve Reich]].<ref name=Fender/>

Okereke has conceded that ''Intimacy'' covers Bloc Party's typical indie rock elements,<ref name=Age/> but noted that the guitars have an artificial and manipulated sound, "almost like all the humanity has been bleached out".<ref name=dummy/> "Halo" has a fast [[tempo]] coupled with a guitar melody that uses only four [[chord (music)|chords]], while "Trojan Horse" features [[syncopation|syncopated]] guitars and distortion.<ref name="sheetmusic">Commercial sheet music for ''Intimacy''. [[Wichita Recordings]] Music Publishing. October 2008. Distributed by [[International Music Publications]].</ref> "Talons" also incorporates distortion from both lead and rhythm guitars,<ref name=sheetmusic /> while the final single "One Month Off" consists of tribal rhythms and [[sixteenth note]] guitar [[riff]]s.<ref name=txt/><ref name=sheetmusic /> "Biko" has a slower tempo and includes guitar [[arpeggio|arpeggi]] throughout, while "Ion Square" incorporates guitar overdubbing and the use of [[hi-hat]] patterns throughout.<ref name=sheetmusic /> According to Nick Southall of [[Drowned in Sound]], "Better Than Heaven" encapsulates what Bloc Party had been trying to achieve in their previous works, "namely aligning all their different directional desires: to swoon, to rock, and to experiment all at once".<ref name=DIS/> The track features broken beats and layered vocals.<ref name=sheetmusic/>
