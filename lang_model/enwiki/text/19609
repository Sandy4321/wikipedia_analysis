The '''Keating Five''' were five [[United States Senate|United States Senators]] accused of [[Political corruption|corruption]] in 1989, igniting a major [[political scandal]] as part of the larger [[Savings and Loan crisis]] of the late 1980s and early 1990s. The five senators, [[Alan Cranston]] ([[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] of [[California]]), [[Dennis DeConcini]] 
(Democrat of [[Arizona]]), [[John Glenn]] (Democrat of [[Ohio]]), [[John McCain]] ([[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] of [[Arizona]]), and [[Donald W. Riegle, Jr.]] (Democrat of [[Michigan]]), were accused of improperly intervening in 1987 on behalf of [[Charles Keating|Charles H. Keating, Jr.]], chairman of the [[Lincoln Savings and Loan Association]], which was the target of a regulatory investigation by the [[Federal Home Loan Bank Board]] (FHLBB). The FHLBB subsequently backed off taking action against Lincoln.

Lincoln Savings and Loan collapsed in 1989, at a cost of over $3 billion to the federal government. Some 23,000 Lincoln bondholders were defrauded and many elderly investors lost their life savings. The substantial political contributions that Keating had made to each of the senators, totaling $1.3 million, attracted considerable public and media attention. After a lengthy investigation, the [[United States Senate Select Committee on Ethics|Senate Ethics Committee]] determined in 1991 that Alan Cranston, Dennis DeConcini, and Donald Riegle had substantially and improperly interfered with the FHLBB in its investigation of Lincoln Savings, with Cranston receiving a formal reprimand. Senators John Glenn and John McCain were cleared of having acted improperly but were criticized for having exercised "poor judgment".

All five of the senators involved served out their [[Term of office|terms]]. Only Glenn and McCain ran for re-election, and they both succeeded. McCain would go on to run for [[President of the United States|president]] twice, including being the unsuccessful Republican Party nominee for president in [[United States presidential election, 2008|2008]].

The U.S. Savings and Loan crisis of the 1980s and early 1990s was the failure of 747 [[savings and loan association]]s (S&Ls) in the United States. The ultimate cost of the crisis is estimated to have totaled around $160.1 billion, about $124.6 billion of which was directly paid for by the U.S. taxpayer.<ref>{{cite news | title= Financial Audit: Resolution Trust Corporation's 1995 and 1994 Financial Statements |

The Keating Five scandal was prompted by the activities of one particular savings and loan: [[Lincoln Savings and Loan Association]] of [[Irvine, California]]. Lincoln's chairman was [[Charles Keating]], who ultimately served five years in prison for his corrupt mismanagement of Lincoln.<ref>Grossman, ''Political Corruption in America: An Encyclopedia of Scandals, Power, and Greed'', [http://books.google.com/books?id=DxupZ6O0p64C&pg=PA199&dq=%22John+Glenn%22+keating&as_brr=3&ei=XA1-SJeNIpWmigH1qpztDw&sig=ACfU3U2zlG0VuDoJbjBHTZgP8jCMm8gMvg#PPA201,M1 p. 201].</ref>  In the four years after Keating's [[American Continental Corporation]] (ACC) had purchased Lincoln in 1984, Lincoln's assets had increased from $1.1 billion to $5.5 billion.<ref name="nyt-who">{{cite news | url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=950DE4D91230F931A15752C1A96F948260 | title=The Lincoln Savings and Loan Investigation: Who Is Involved | publisher=''[[The New York Times]]'' | date=1989-11-22}}</ref>

==Corruption allegations==
The core allegation of the Keating Five affair is that Keating had made contributions of about $1.3 million to various U.S. Senators, and he called on those Senators to help him resist regulators. The regulators backed off, to later disastrous consequences.

Beginning in 1985, [[Edwin J. Gray]], chair of the [[Federal Home Loan Bank Board]] (FHLBB), feared that the savings industry's risky investment practices were exposing the government's insurance funds to huge losses.<ref name="nyt070989"/>  Gray instituted a rule whereby savings associations could hold no more than ten percent of their assets in "direct investments",<ref name="nyt070989"/> and were thus prohibited from taking ownership positions in certain financial entities and instruments.<ref name="az-keating"/> Lincoln had become burdened with bad debt resulting from its past aggressiveness, and by early 1986,<ref name="nyt070989"/> its investment practices were being investigated and audited by the FHLBB:<ref name="ohio-glenn"/> in particular, whether it had violated these direct investment rules; Lincoln had directed [[Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation]]-insured accounts into commercial real estate ventures.<ref name="nyt-who"/>
By the end of 1986, the FHLBB had found that Lincoln had $135 million in unreported losses and had surpassed the regulated direct investments limit by $600 million.<ref name="nyt070989"/>

Keating had earlier taken several measures to oppose Gray and the FHLBB, including recruiting a study from then-private economist [[Alan Greenspan]] saying that direct investments were not harmful,<ref name="nyt070989"/> and getting President [[Ronald Reagan]] to make a recess appointment of a Keating ally, Atlanta real estate developer Lee H. Henkel Jr., to an open seat on the FHLBB.<ref name="nyt070989"/>  But by March 1987, Henkel had resigned, upon news of his having large loans due to Lincoln.<ref name="nyt070989"/>  Meanwhile, the Senate had changed control from Republican to Democratic during the [[United States Senate elections, 1986|1986 Congressional elections]], placing several Democratic senators in key positions, and starting in January 1987, Keating's staff was putting pressure on Cranston to remove Gray from any FHLBB discussion regarding Lincoln.<ref name="trust-275">Binstein and Bowden, ''Trust Me'', p. 275.</ref>  The following month, Keating began large-scale contributions into Cranston's project to increase California voter registration.<ref name="trust-275"/>  In February 1987, Keating met with Riegle and began contributing to Riegle's 1988 re-election campaign.<ref name="trust-279">Binstein and Bowden, ''Trust Me'', pp. 278<U+2013>279.</ref>

It appeared as though the government might seize Lincoln for being insolvent.<ref name="az-keating"/> The investigation was, however, taking a long time.<ref name="ohio-glenn"/>  Keating was asking that Lincoln be given a lenient judgment by the FHLBB, so that it could limit its high risk investments and get into the safe (at the time) [[Mortgage loan|home mortgage]] business, thus allowing the business to survive. A letter from audit firm [[Arthur Young & Co.]] bolstered Keating's case that the government investigation was taking a long time.<ref name="alex-k5-1"/>  Keating now wanted the five senators to intervene with the FHLBB on his behalf.

By March 1987, Riegle was telling Gray that "Some senators out west are very concerned about the way the bank board is regulating Lincoln Savings," adding somewhat ominously, "I think you need to meet with the senators. You'll be getting a call."<ref name="trust-279"/>  Keating and DeConcini were asking McCain to travel to San Francisco to meet with regulators regarding Lincoln Savings; McCain refused.<ref name="az-keating"/><ref name="alex-k5-1">Alexander, ''Man of the People'', pp. 108<U+2013>111.</ref>  DeConcini told Keating that McCain was nervous about interfering.<ref name="az-keating"/>  Keating called McCain a "wimp" behind his back, and on March 24, Keating and McCain had a heated, contentious meeting.<ref name="alex-k5-1"/>

On April 2, 1987, a meeting with chairman Gray of the FHLBB was held in DeConcini's Capitol office, with Senators Cranston, Glenn, and McCain also in attendance.<ref name="az-keating"/> The senators requested that no staff be present.<ref name="Seidman">Seidman, ''Full Faith and Credit'', pp. 233, 235.</ref>  DeConcini started the meeting with a mention of "our friend at Lincoln."<ref name="az-keating"/>  Gray told the assembled senators that he did not know the particular details of the status of Lincoln Savings and Loan, and that the senators would have to go to the bank regulators in San Francisco that had oversight jurisdiction for the bank. Gray did offer to set up a meeting between those regulators and the senators.<ref name="az-keating"/>

On April 9, 1987, a two-hour meeting<ref name="nyt-who"/> with three members of the FHLBB San Francisco branch was held, again in DeConcini's office, to discuss the government's investigation of Lincoln.<ref name="az-keating"/><ref name="alex-k5-1"/>  Present were Cranston, DeConcini, Glenn, McCain, and additionally Riegle.<ref name="az-keating"/>  The regulators felt that the meeting was very unusual and that they were being pressured by a united front, as the senators presented their reasons for having the meeting.<ref name="az-keating"/>  DeConcini began the meeting by saying, "We wanted to meet with you because we have determined that potential actions of yours could injure a constituent."<ref name="inside">Pizzo, ''Inside Job'', pp. 291, 294<U+2013>296.</ref>  McCain said, "One of our jobs as elected officials is to help constituents in a proper fashion. ACC [American Continental Corporation] is a big employer and important to the local economy. I wouldn't want any special favors for them.... I don't want any part of our conversation to be improper." Glenn said, "To be blunt, you should charge them or get off their backs," while DeConcini said, "What's wrong with this if they're willing to clean up their act? ... It's very unusual for us to have a company that could be put out of business by its regulators."<ref name="az-keating"/> The regulators then revealed that Lincoln was under criminal investigation on a variety of serious charges, at which point McCain severed all relations with Keating.<ref name="az-keating"/>

The San Francisco regulators finished their report in May 1987 and recommended that Lincoln be seized by the government due to unsound lending practices.<ref name="nyt-who"/><ref name="az-keating"/>  Gray, whose time as chair was about to expire, deferred action on the report, saying that his adversarial relationship with Keating would make any action he took seem vindictive, and that instead the incoming chair should take over the decision.<ref name="nyt070989"/>  Meanwhile Keating filed a lawsuit against the FHLBB, saying it had leaked confidential information about Lincoln.<ref name="nyt070989"/>  The new FHLBB chair was [[M. Danny Wall]], who was more sympathetic to Keating and took no action on the report, saying its evidence was insufficient.<ref name="nyt-who"/><ref name="az-keating"/>  In September 1987, the Lincoln investigation was removed from the San Francisco group<ref name="az-keating"/> and in May 1988, the FHLBB signed an agreement with Lincoln that included not going ahead with a criminal referral to the Department of Justice.<ref name="pnt071493"/>  In July 1988, a new audit of both Lincoln and American Continental began in Washington.<ref name="az-keating"/><ref name="pnt071493"/>

Cranston continued intervening on behalf of Keating after the April 1987 meetings, contacting both Wall and California state regulators and continuing to receive large amounts of new donations to the voter registration projects from Keating.<ref name="ct011490">{{cite news | url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/nationworld/chi-keating-1,0,3744890.story | title=Who were the Keating Five? | publisher=''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' | date=1990-01-14}}</ref>  DeConcini also continued on behalf of Keating, contacting Wall, California state regulators, and the [[Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation]] (FDIC) advocating approval of a sale of Lincoln as a December 1988 alternative to government seizure.<ref name="pnt071493"/><ref name="ct011490"/>  But bank regulators refused to approve the sale of Lincoln.<ref name="pnt071493"/>  Glenn too continued to help Keating after the April 1987 revelation, by setting up a meeting with then-House Majority Leader [[Jim Wright]].<ref name="Karaagac" />

News of the April meetings between the senators and the FHLBB officials first appeared in ''[[National Thrift News]]'' in September 1987, but was only sporadically covered by the general media for the next year and a half.<ref name="wtff-185">McCain and Salter, ''Worth the Fighting For'', pp. 185<U+2013>186.

During the [[United States presidential election, 1988|1988 U.S. presidential election]], McCain was mentioned by the press as a vice-presidential running mate for Republican nominee [[George H. W.

==Failure of Lincoln and investigation of the senators==
Lincoln stayed in business; from mid-1987 to April 1989, its assets grew from $3.91 billion to $5.46 billion.<ref name="nyt070989"/>  During this time, the parent American Continental Corporation was desperate for cash inflow to make up for losses in real estate purchases and projects.<ref name="nyt113089">{{cite news | url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=950DE1D81131F933A05752C1A96F948260 | title= Collapse of Lincoln Savings Leaves Scars for Rich, Poor and the Faithful | author=Nash, Nathaniel C. | publisher=''[[The New York Times]]'' | date=1989-11-30}}</ref> Lincoln's branch managers and tellers convinced customers to replace their federally-insured [[certificates of deposit]] with higher-yielding bond certificates of American Continental; the customers later said they were never properly informed that the bonds were uninsured and very risky given the state of American Continental's finances.<ref name="nyt113089"/>  Indeed the regulators had already adjudged the bonds to have no solvent backing.<ref name="Seidman"/>  FDIC chair [[L.

Keating was hit with a $1.1 billion fraud and racketeering action, filed against him by the regulators.<ref name="nyt-who"/>  In talking to reporters in April, Keating said, "One question, among many raised in recent weeks, had to do with whether my financial support in any way influenced several political figures to take up my cause.

In the wake of the Lincoln failure, former FHLBB chair Gray went public about all five of the senators' assistance to Keating in a May 21, 1989 front page story by John Dougherty in the ''[[Dayton Daily News]]'', saying that in the April 1987 meetings the senators had sought "to directly subvert the regulatory process" to benefit Keating.<ref name="pnt071493">{{cite news | url=http://www.phoenixnewtimes.com/1993-07-14/news/deconcini-keating/ | title=DeConcini & Keating | author=Dougherty, John | publisher=''[[Phoenix New Times]]'' | date=1993-07-14}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | title=unknown | author=Dougherty, John | publisher=''[[Dayton Daily News]]'' | date=1989-05-21}} See also ''Preliminary inquiry into allegations regarding Senators Cranston, DeConcini, Glenn, McCain, and Riegle, and Lincoln Savings and Loan'' committee report, p. 126.</ref>  Press attention to the senators began to pick up, with a July 1989 ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' article about Cranston's role.<ref name="kurtz"/>  With a couple of months, ''[[Arizona Republic]]'' and ''[[Washington Post]]'' reporters were investigating McCain's personal relationships with Keating.<ref name="kurtz"/>

==Relationships of senators to Keating==
Much of the press attention to the Keating Five focused on the relationships of each of the senators to Keating.

Cranston had received $39,000 from Keating and his associates for his 1986 Senate re-election campaign.<ref name="nyt-who"/>  Furthermore, Keating had donated some $850,000 to assorted groups founded by Cranston or controlled by him, and another $85,000 to the [[California Democratic Party]].<ref name="nyt-who"/>  Cranston considered Keating a constituent because Lincoln was based in California.<ref name="nyt110589"/>

==Senate Ethics Committee investigation and findings==
===History===
The [[Senate Ethics Committee]]'s investigation began on November 17, 1989.<ref name="wtff-194"/> It focused on all five senators and lasted 22 months,<ref name="Dewar">{{cite news | author=Dewar, Helen | url=http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/washingtonpost/access/74752416.html?dids=74752416:74752416&FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT&date=NOV+21%2C+1991&author=Helen+Dewar&pub=The+Washington+Post&desc=Cranston+Accepts+Reprimand%3B+%60Keating+5'+Senator+Angers+Colleagues+by+Denying+Misconduct&pqatl=google | title=Cranston Accepts Reprimand; 'Keating 5' Senator Angers Colleagues by Denying Misconduct | publisher=''[[The Washington Post]]'' | date=1991-11-21}}</ref> with 9 months of active investigation and 7 weeks of hearings.<ref name="williams-103">Williams, ''Political Scandals in the USA'', p. 103.</ref>  The committee was composed of three Democratic senators, [[Howell Heflin]] (chair), [[David Pryor]], and [[Terry Sanford]], and three Republican senators, [[Warren Rudman]] (vice chair), [[Trent Lott]], and [[Jesse Helms]].<ref name="wtff-194">McCain and Salter, ''Worth the Fighting For'', pp. 194<U+2013>195.

Bennett]] was appointed as special outside counsel to the committee, tasked with conducting the investigation.<ref name="wtff-194"/>

Initially the committee investigated in private. On September 10, 1990, Bennett submitted a confidential report, which soon leaked, that recommended that the committee continue its investigation of Cranston, DeConcini, and Riegle, but take no action against Glenn and McCain,<ref name="wapo020891"/> as there was insufficient evidence to pursue the latter two.<ref name="nyt092990">{{cite news | url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C0CE4DA133EF93AA1575AC0A966958260 | title= Ethics Committee is Urged to Clear 2 of 5 in Savings Inquiry | author=Berke, Richard L. | publisher=''[[The New York Times]]'' | date=1990-09-29}}</ref>  Bennett also recommended that public hearings be held.<ref name="Bennett"/>

Speculation that this would be the decision had already taken place, and both Glenn and McCain were frustrated that the long delay in resolving their cases was damaging their reputations.<ref name="nyt092990"/>  However, there were political implications, as the removal of the two would eliminate the only Republican from the case.<ref name="nyt092990"/>  The committee's work was further made difficult by there being no specific rule that governed the propriety of members intervening with federal regulators.<ref name="nyt092990"/>  By mid-October, several Republican senators, including former Ethics Committee chair [[Ted Stevens]], were taking the unusual step of publicly complaining about the Ethics Committee's inaction, saying that it was unfair to Glenn and McCain, that the whole lengthy process was unfair to all five, and that political motives might be behind the delays.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C0CEFD81E3DF936A25753C1A966958260 | title= G.O.P.

The committee reported on the other four senators in February 1991, but delayed its final report on Cranston until November 1991.<ref name="williams-103"/>  During that period there was partisan-aligned disagreement within the committee over how to treat Cranston, and in August 1991 a special counsel's report was released by Helms.<ref name="nyt080591">{{cite news | url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D0CE4DA113AF936A3575BC0A967958260 | title=Cranston Censure Urged by Counsel | author=Berke, Richard L. | publisher=''[[The New York Times]]'' | date=1991-08-05}}</ref>  A delay was also caused when Pryor suffered a heart attack in April 1991, and was replaced on the committee by [[Jeff Bingaman]].<ref name="nyt082291">{{cite news | url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D0CE7DD1538F931A1575BC0A967958260 | title= Senator Pryor Returns to Ethics Committee | publisher=''[[The New York Times]]'' | date=1991-08-22}}</ref>  Bingaman spent months learning the complex materials involved in the matter, only to resign in July due to a conflict of interest.<ref name="nyt082291"/>  Pryor was reassigned to the committee in August 1991, so as to not further delay its deliberations.<ref name="nyt082291"/>

The various committee reports addressed each of the five senators.

===Cranston: reprimanded===
The Senate Ethics Committee ruled that Cranston had acted improperly by interfering with the investigation by the FHLBB.<ref name="PBS">{{cite web

He had received more than a million dollars from Keating, including $850,000 to the voter registration groups closely affiliated with him; he had done more arm-twisting than the other Senators on Keating's behalf; and was the only Senator officially rebuked by the Senate in this matter.<ref name="Salinger" />

Cranston was given the harshest penalty of all five Senators.
In November 1991, the [[Senate Ethics Committee]] voted unanimously to reprimand Cranston, instead of the more severe measure that was under consideration: [[censure]] by the full Senate. Extenuating circumstances that helped to save Cranston from censure were the fact that he was suffering from cancer, and that he had decided to not seek reelection, according to chair Heflin. The Ethics Committee took the unusual step of delivering its reprimand to Cranston during a formal session of the full Senate, with almost all 100 Senators present.<ref name="Dewar" />

Cranston was not accused of breaking any specific laws or rules, but of violating standards that Heflin said <U+201C>do not permit official actions to be linked with fund-raising.<U+201D>  Although the Ethics Committee stated "No evidence was presented to the Committee that Senator Cranston ever agreed to help Mr. Keating in return for a contribution," the Committee officially found that Cranston<U+2019>s conduct had been <U+201C>improper and repugnant<U+201D>, deserving of "the fullest, strongest and most severe sanction which the committee has the authority to impose."  The sanction was in these words: "the Senate Select Committee on Ethics, on behalf of and in the name of the United States Senate, does hereby strongly and severely reprimand Sen. Alan Cranston.<U+201D><ref name="Dewar" /><ref>''Senate Select Committee on Ethics, Investigation of Senator Alan Cranston ...''</ref>

After the Senate reprimanded Cranston, he took to the Senate floor to deny key charges against him. In response, vice-chair Rudman charged that Cranston<U+2019>s response to the reprimand was <U+201C>arrogant, unrepentant and a smear on this institution," and that Cranston was wrong to imply that everyone does what Cranston had done.  [[Alan Dershowitz]], serving as Senator Cranston's attorney, alleged that other Senators had merely been better at <U+201C>covering their tracks.<U+201D><ref name="Dewar" />

===Riegle and DeConcini: criticized for acting improperly===
The Senate Ethics Committee ruled that Riegle and DeConcini had acted improperly by interfering with the investigation by the FHLBB.<ref name="PBS"/>  Specifically, it said that even though neither of them violated any Senate rule, their conduct "gave the appearance of being improper."<ref name="ct022891">{{cite news | url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/nationworld/chi-keating-2,0,3810427.story | title=Senate ethics panel cites Cranston in Keating Five case | publisher=''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' | date=1991-02-28}}</ref>  DeConcini was especially faulted for having taken the lead in the two meetings with the FHLBB.<ref name="ct022891"/>

After the ruling, Riegle expressed contrition, saying "I certainly regret and accept responsibility [for actions that] did lend themselves to an appearance of a conflict of interest."<ref name="ct022891"/>  DeConcini, however, said he would continue to be "aggressive" in representing his constituents in their affairs with federal regulators.<ref name="ct022891"/>

===Glenn and McCain: cleared of impropriety but criticized for poor judgment===
The Senate Ethics Committee ruled that the involvement of Glenn in the scheme was minimal, and the charges against him were dropped.<ref name="PBS"/>  He was only criticized by the Committee for "poor judgment."<ref>Regens and Gaddie, ''The Economic Realities of Political Reform'', [http://books.google.com/books?id=xsVEhSJzmIIC&dq=%22John+Glenn%22+keating&lr=&as_brr=3&source=gbs_summary_s&cad=0 p. 6.]</ref>

It's a wrong appearance when a group of senators appear in a meeting with a group of regulators, because it conveys the impression of undue and improper influence. And it was the wrong thing to do."<ref name="az-keating"/>

Regardless of the level of their involvement, both senators were greatly affected by it. McCain would write in 2002 that attending the two April 1987 meetings was "the worst mistake of my life".<ref>McCain and Salter, ''Worth the Fighting For'', p. 161.

The Senate Ethics Committee did not pursue, for lack of jurisdiction, any possible ethics breaches in McCain's delayed reimbursements to Keating for trips at the latter's expense, because they occurred while McCain was in the House.<ref name="bg022900"/>  The [[House Committee on Standards of Official Conduct]] said that it too lacked jurisdiction, because McCain was no longer in the House.<ref name="wtff-188">McCain and Salter, ''Worth the Fighting For'', p. 188.

===Reactions===
Not everyone was satisfied with the Senate Ethics Committee conclusions.

The scandal was followed by a number of attempts to adopt campaign finance reform<U+2014>spearheaded by U.S. Sen. [[David Boren]] (D-OK)<U+2014>but most attempts died in committee. A weakened reform was passed in 1993. Substantial campaign finance reform was not passed until the adoption of the [[Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act|McCain-Feingold Act]] in 2002. Bennett would later write that the Keating Five investigation did make a difference, as members of Congress were afterward far less likely to intercede with federal investigations on behalf of contributors.<ref>Bennett, ''In the Ring'', p. 148.</ref>

In early October 2008, the Keating Five scandal, its possible parallel to the [[subprime mortgage crisis]] and [[liquidity crisis of September 2008]], and specifically the role in the scandal of Republican presidential nominee McCain, were briefly emphasized by the campaign of his Democratic opponent, [[Barack Obama]], through a 13-minute "documentary" entitled ''Keating Economics''.<ref name="wapo100608">{{cite news | url=http://voices.washingtonpost.com/the-trail/2008/10/06/dems_forget_ayers_remember_kea.html | title=Dems: Forget Ayers, Remember Keating | author=Bacon Jr, Perry | publisher=''[[The Washington Post]]'' | date=2008-10-06 | accessdate=2008-10-06}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | url=http://washingtontimes.com/news/2008/oct/31/candidates-attack-political-associations/ | title=Candidates attack political associations | author=Miller, S.A. | publisher=''[[The Washington Times]]'' | date=2008-10-31 | accessdate=2008-11-19}}</ref>  This introduction occurred after the McCain campaign began emphasizing the [[Obama<U+2013>Ayers controversy]].<ref name="wapo100608"/>  The Keating Five matter otherwise had little impact on McCain's eventually unsuccessful campaign.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.rawstory.com/news/2008/Fox_host_tells_guest_mentioning_Keating_0925.html | title=Fox host tells guest mentioning McCain role in Keating Five scandal to 'pipe down' | author=Juliano, Nick | publisher=[[The Raw Story]] | date=2008-09-25 | accessdate=2009-01-04}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref>
