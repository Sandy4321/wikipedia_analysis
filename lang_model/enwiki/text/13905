==Legal disputes==
In October 1989, Evan Demoulas was notified that the Commonwealth of Massachusetts was seeking back taxes on $1 million worth of stock he had sold three years earlier. Demoulas was confused by the call, as he had never sold any stock. He investigated and found this his uncle, Mike Demoulas, had purchased much of his and his family's shares in Demoulas Super Markets without their knowledge.<ref name=family />

In 1990, the widow and children of George Demoulas sued Mike Demoulas, alleging that they had been defrauded out of their shares in the company. They claimed they had trusted Mike to take care of the family after George's death and that he exploited this trust in order to have them sell all of George's real estate and 84% of his shares in DeMoulas Super Markets to members of his own family pennies on the dollar.<ref name="Demoulas v. Demoulas" /> Mike Demoulas contended that his brother's heirs had willingly sold their shares in the company because they wanted money and their stock in DeMoulas did not pay dividends. According to Mike Demoulas, Evanthea, asked him to sell her shares so she could have money to raise her children, Evan sold his shares to he could began his auto racing career, and Diana and Fotene sold their shares after the saw how much money their brother received. However, once the company began paying dividends in 1988, the family saw how much money they could have made if they had kept their shares and sought to "rewrite history" in order to regain what they had sold. George's children acknowledged that they had signed many of the documents authorizing the sales and transfers, but stated they were not aware of what they were signing because they were too young to understand and trusted their uncle to take care of them. A jury found in favor of George's family.<ref name="Demoulas v. Demoulas" /><ref name=Zealousness>{{cite journal|last=Frisch|first=Michael S.|title=Zealousness Run Amok|journal=The Georgetown Journal of Legal Ethics|date=Fall 2007}}</ref> 

A few weeks after the decision, George's son Arthur S. Demoulas filed a second suit, this time alleging that Mike Demoulas had diverted assets from the jointly-owned family company, Demoulas Super Markets, to ones controlled by him and his children, including Market Basket. After an eighty-four day bench trial, judge [[Maria Lopez]] found in favor of the plaintiffs. Lopez awarded George's family about $206 million for dividends on stock that had been improperly diverted and 50.5% of the company. She also ordered that all of the assets of Market Basket and the other companies controlled by Mike Demoulas and his family be transferred to Demoulas Super Markets and that Mike Demoulas be removed as president of the company.<ref name=Zealousness /><ref name=wiretap>{{cite news|last=Nealon|first=Patricia|title=Wiretap claims are key to DeMoulas fight|newspaper=The Boston Globe|date=16 July 1997}}</ref>

In early September 1990, six [[Covert listening device|bugs]] were found at the headquarters of DeMoulas Super Markets. It was alleged that Arthur S. Demoulas had planted the bugs in order to listen to the legal strategy of the other side of the Demoulas family. Michael Kettenbach, the son-in law of Mike Demoulas, sued Arthur S. Demoulas, claiming that Demoulas had "invaded his privacy rights by having listening devices planted at DSM headquarters." In 1994, a jury found in favor of Arthur S. Demoulas.<ref name=Zealousness /><ref name=wiretap /> However, a new trial was granted after a woman came forward with new evidence - a recording of her boyfriend admitting to bugging the office for Arthur S. Demoulas. The case was damaged though when the woman admitted to being a crack cocaine addict who received about $500,000 in housing and other expenses from the family of Telemachus Demoulas and the man on the tape testified that he had been lying during the recorded conversation. On August 4, 1997, Arthur S. Demoulas was again cleared of wiretapping charges by a federal jury.<ref name=Zealousness /><ref name=Zealousness /><ref>{{cite news|last=Nealon|first=Patricia|title=Federal court jury clears Demoulas|newspaper=The Boston Globe|date=5 August 1997}}</ref>

In 1991, George Demoulas' family sued Mike Demoulas, Arthur T. Demoulas, and DeMoulas Super Markets, Inc. chief financial officer D. Harold Sullivan, alleging that the three violated the [[Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974]] by using their positions as the trustees of the company's employee profit-sharing plan to make fiscally irresponsible real estate loans to friends and business associates.<ref>{{cite news|last=Kennedy|first=John H.|title=Demoulas family in another legal squabble|newspaper=The Boston Globe|date=16 October 1991}}</ref> The [[United States Department of Labor]] filed a similar complaint six months later.<ref>{{cite news|last=Zuckoff|first=Mitchell|title=Labor Dept. Joins Demoulas Family Fight|newspaper=The Boston Globe|date=13 June 1992}}</ref> On May 31, 1994 the Department of Labor announced that they had reached a settlement in which the trustees agreed to sell $22 million of the loans by July 11 or purchase them themselves as well as pay the plan $750,000 to make up for the dropped interest rates on the loans (unless the loan recipients paid the money instead). The trustees also agreed not to make any similar investments. The trustees admitted no wrongdoing in the case.<ref>{{cite news|last=Kennedy|first=John H.|title=Demoulas pension plan suit is settled|newspaper=The Boston Globe|date=1 June 1994}}</ref> Despite the heavy investment in risky real estate loans, the plan never posted a loss. In the civil case, Judge [[Rya W. Zobel]] ruled that the trustees' actions were "wrong but not corrupt" and that the settlement with the Department of Labor was "an adequate remedy". Therefore, she denied the request to have them removed.<ref>{{cite news|last=Reidy|first=Chris|title=Pension trustees cleared|newspaper=The Boston Globe|date=14 April 1995}}</ref>

In 1997 the [[Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court]] upheld a lower court's ruling that Arthur T. Demoulas had presented the DeMoulas Super Markets Board of Directors with <U+201C>misleading, inaccurate, and materially incomplete<U+201D> information in order to receive a rejection and keep his cousins from receiving any of the profits from Lee Drug, a pharmacy chain he started after the board rejected his proposal to start a pharmacy division of Market Basket.<ref name=touch>{{cite news|last=Borchers|first=Callum|title=Arthur T.

[[File:Market Basket at the Cape Cod Factory Outlet Mall.JPG|thumb|Market Basket store in Bourne]]
In a 2010 memo to the Board of Directors, Arthur S. Demoulas accused Arthur T. Demoulas of "plundering" millions by paying millions in excessive real estate prices for new Market Basket store locations. One example cited in the memo alleged that Arthur T. had recommended that the company pay $20.9 million to purchase a property in [[Bourne, Massachusetts]] owned by an entity in which he was a major investor. After the sale, Arthur S. had the property appraised by a Boston real estate executive, who valued the property at $9 million. He also accused Arthur T. of paying "grossly excessive fees" to Retail Development and Management Inc., a real estate firmed owned by his brothers-in-law Michael Kettenbach and Joseph Pasquale that oversaw Market Basket's real estate and helped it develop new stores. He and his attorneys argued that the 7.5% of the total development costs "was far in excess" of the prevailing market rate of 2% to 3%.<ref name=memos>{{cite news|last=Ross|first=Casey|title= Legal memos trace acrimony between Demoulas factions|newspaper=The Boston Globe|date=2 August 2014|url=http://www.bostonglobe.com/business/2014/08/01/legal-memos-trace-acrimony-between-demoulas-factions-over-real-estate-deals/FPXxU0sANyOcyzmpzjISmO/story.html}}</ref> Arthur T. denied his cousin's claim. He argued that Arthur S. trumped up the charges in order to take control of the company and pay himself and the other shareholders more money. Attorneys for Arthur T. noted that [[Cushman & Wakefield]] later appraised the Bourne property at $25.5 million. Arthur T. also defended his arrangement with Kettenbach and Pasquale, which he said allowed Market Basket to purchase properties without alerting its competitors, thus avoiding a bidding war and saving the company money.<ref name=memos /> The Board of Directors hired Mel L. Greenberg, a retired judge, to investigate Arthur S.' claims. Greenberg found that there was no wrongdoing by Arthur T. in the purchase of real estate (including the Bourne property) that the fees paid to Retail Development and Management were not excessive. However, he did find that Arthur T. and the Board of Directors had neglected their fiduciary duties by not looking into whether or not the company would have been better off if it had exercised its option to purchase its store in [[Somersworth, New Hampshire]] instead of renting it from a company in which Arthur T. and his family owned a 55% stake.<ref name=memos />
