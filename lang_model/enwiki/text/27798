'''Lysophosphatidylethanolamine (LPE)''' is a class of chemical compounds which are derived from [[phosphatidylethanolamine]]. They result from partial [[hydrolysis]] of phosphatidylethanolamine, which removes one of the [[fatty acid]] groups. The hydrolysis is generally the result of the enzymatic action of [[phospholipase A2]].<ref>Phosphatidylcholine and related lipids, lipidlibrary.co.uk</ref> LPE can be used in agricultural use to regulate plant growth such as color increase, sugar content increase, plant health increase, and storability increase without side effect.

LPE is present as a minor [[phospholipid]] in the [[cell membrane]]. Actually, LPE was detected in human serum, and its level is reported to be about several hundred ng mL<sup>-1</sup>. Available sources of LPE are [[egg yolk lecithin]] (<U+2264>1.5%),<ref>Satirhos, N., B. Herslof and L. Kenne, J.Lipid Res. 27:386(1986)</ref> [[soybean lecithin]] (<U+2264>0.2%),<ref>Weber, E.J., in Lecithins, edited by B.F. Szuhaj and G.R.

== Function ==
Lysophosphatidylethanolamine (LPE) is a minor constituent of cell membranes. LPE plays a role in cell-mediated [[cell signaling]] and [[enzyme activator|activation]] of other [[enzyme]]s.<ref>S.B. Ryu, Trends in Plant Science 9:5 (2004) 229-239</ref> The physiological significance of the plasma LPE remains unknown. However, LPE has antifungal and antibacterial activity in the housefly,<ref>Meylaers K., Clynen E., Daloze D., Deloof A., and Schoofs L., Musca domestica. Insect Biochem Mol Biol 34:1(2004) 43-49</ref> and in certain mushrooms, it stimulates the [[MAPK cascade]].

Previous studies showed that LPE, a natural phospholipid, can accelerate [[ripening]] and prolong [[shelf life]] of [[tomato]] fruit,<ref>Farag KM, Palta JP, Physiol Plant. 87(1993) 515-521</ref> and retard [[senescence]] in attached and detached leaves and fruit of tomato.<ref>Farag KM, Palta JP, Hort Technol, 3(1993) 62-65</ref> In other studies, LPE inhibited the activity of [[phospholipase D]] (PLD), a membrane degrading enzyme, of which active is increased during senescence.<ref>Ryu SB, Karlsson BH, Ozgen M, Palta JP, Proc Natl, Acad Sci. 94(1997), 12717-12721</ref> More recently, it is reported that LPE can also accelerate color development and promote shelf life of [[cranberries]],<ref>Ozgen M, Palta JP, ISHS Acta Horticulturae 628: XXVI International Horticultural Congress</ref> and increase fruit qualities of [[Thompson seedless grape]]s, in such as [[soluble solids content]] (SSC), [[titratable acidity]] (TA), firmness, and size.<ref>Hong J-H, Hwang SK, Chung G-H, Cowan AK, J Appl Hortic. 9(2007) 112-114</ref> Along with these results show that LPE can accelerate ripening of fruit and also, have potential to protect senescence.

Lysophosphatidylethanolamine (LPE) is composed of a [[ethanolamine]] head group and [[glycerophosphoric acid]] with a various fatty acid located sn-1 position. The fatty acid may be saturated or unsaturated [[acyl]].

*Chemical name: 1-Acyl-sn-glycero-3-phospho(2-aminoethanol)
*CAS number: 95046-40-5
*Molecular weight: <U+2245>479

== Uses ==
Lysophosphatidylethanolamine (LPE) is a minor membrane glycerolipid; however, it has been reported that it has useful physiological effects on fruit and vegetable crops. LPE was approved by the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] for use on agricultural crops. It is used with tomatoes, peppers, grapes, cranberry, and oranges for increasing color, sugar contents and their storage life. In addition, it is reported that LPE can delay senescence in leaves and fruits, and mitigate stress of [[ethylene]]-induced process.<ref>A.K. Cowan, Plant Signaling & Behavior, 4:4 (2009) 324-327</ref>

SignaFresh, the brand name made of LPE, is helpful for crops to be valuable product. Preharvest application of SignaFresh leads ideal postharvest behaviors.<ref>Mustafa Ozgen, Aylik olarak yayinlanan HASAD, 2011-27-316</ref>
