'''Barbara Hafer''' (born [[Los Angeles]] [[August 1]] [[1943]]) is a U.S politician from the U.S State of [[Pennsylvania]]. 

Hafer has served as a County Commissioner in [[Allegheny County]] (1984-1989), State Auditor General (1989-1997) and State Treasurer (1997-2005). In 1990, she was the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] nominee for [[List of Governors of Pennsylvania|Governor]] against [[Robert P. Casey]].  Hafer was defeated 68%-32% in one of the most lopsided victories in state history.

In 2002, Hafer explored a run for the Republican nomination for Governor to succeed [[Mark Schweiker]]. However, after it became clear that the GOP establishment had already decided on Pennsylvania [[Attorney General]] [[D. Michael Fisher|Mike Fisher]], she dropped out of the race. During the campaign, Hafer decided to endorse [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] [[Ed Rendell]].  In 2003, Hafer completed her political conversion by switching to the Democratic Party.  

After her party switch, it was reported that she was considering a [[2006]] bid for [[Lieutenant Governor of Pennsylvania|lieutenant governor]], challenging Lieutenant Governor [[Catherine Baker Knoll]] in the Democratic primary. Hafer and Baker Knoll had a long standing political feud which dates to Hafer's two races for treasurer.  In 1996, Hafer defeated Knoll's daughter, Mina Baker Knoll, for treasurer and in 2000 defeated Baker Knoll for treasurer.  Knoll preceded Hafer as state treasurer.

Most recently in [[2005]], she has passed on two major races. In early [[2005]], she chose not to seek the Democratic [[Nomination]] for U.S. Senate against [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] Senator [[Rick Santorum]]. In [[2005]], she decided against a challenge to Republican Congressman [[Tim Murphy (congressman)|Tim Murphy]], choosing instead to focus on her new consulting business.

Prior to her political career, Hafer was employed as a [[registered nurse]].
