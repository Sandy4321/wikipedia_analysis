'''Deep Sea World''' is a popular [[Public aquarium|aquarium]] located in the village of [[North Queensferry]], in [[Fife]], [[Scotland]]. It is host to a collection of large sand tiger sharks, also known as ragged toothed sharks or grey nurse sharks, and various other species of shark.

==History==

The aquarium opened in 1994 in the site of the disused Battery Quarry, below the [[Forth Rail Bridge]].<ref name="edinburgh"/> It is owned and operated by the [[Spanish people|Spanish]] [[Aspro Ocio Group]], who also run the [[Blue Planet Aquarium]] in [[England]] and many other aquaria in [[Europe]].

==Exhibits==

One of the main attractions is the 112 meter long [[Transparency (optics)|transparent]] [[Polymethyl methacrylate|acrylic]] underwater viewing tunnel, which is one of the longest of its kind in the world.<ref name="longest"/> The curvature of the {{Convert|6.5|cm|sing=on}} thick acrylic causes a de-magnifying effect on all of the creatures in the exhibit&mdash;roughly one third reduction.<ref name="aqua_tunnel"/> The tank with the tunnel contains {{Convert|1000000|impgal}} of sea water pumped in from the River Forth.<ref name="rampantscotland"/> This water is generally around {{Convert|14|C}}, but varies with the season. Because of the low temperature most animals within the tunnel are from around Britain. Sand tiger sharks are generally found in warmer water, for example [[Florida]] and [[South Africa]]. They easily adapt to the change in temperature, but the lower temperature reduces the rate of metabolism.

The aquarium also displays various tanks and rock pools containing exotic fish and other sea animals.

In 2005, the aquarium opened a new [[Pinniped|seal]] enclosure which houses resident seals as well as injured ones rescued by the [[SSPCA]].
