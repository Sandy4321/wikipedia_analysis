'''''Hannah Montana''''' is the [[soundtrack album]] for the [[Hannah Montana (season 1)|first season]] of the television series ''[[Hannah Montana]]'', released on October 24, 2006 by [[Walt Disney Records]]. The program itself premiered through the [[Disney Channel]] on March 24, 2006; after becoming an immediate commercial success, production on its soundtrack began the following month. Eight of its thirteen tracks are performed by the series' primary actress [[Miley Cyrus]], and are credited to her titular character [[Miley Stewart#Hannah Montana|Hannah Montana]]. The groups [[The Click Five]], [[Everlife]], [[B5 (group)|B5]], and recording artist [[Jesse McCartney]] each contribute one recording, while a duet between Cyrus and her father [[Billy Ray Cyrus]] is included as the final track. The soundtrack is primarily a [[teen pop]] record, which sees additional influences from [[pop rock]] and [[country pop]] musical styles. The lyrical themes revolve largely around "[[girl power]]", teen romance, and the double life that Cyrus' character lives on the program.

''Hannah Montana'' received generally favorable reviews from [[Music journalism|music critics]], who appreciated its overall production. It debuted at number one on the U.S. [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] with first-week sales of 286,000 copies. In doing so, it became Cyrus' first number-one album, the first television soundtrack to reach the peak position on the chart, and the fourth soundtrack from [[The Walt Disney Company]] to debut in the top-ten of the chart. The record has since been certified [[RIAA certification|triple-platinum]] by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA), having exceeded shipments of three million copies in the United States. The soundtrack charted moderately on international [[record chart]]s, having reached the top-twenty in countries including Austria, Canada, Norway, and Spain.

The series' theme song "[[The Best of Both Worlds (song)|The Best of Both Worlds]]" was released as the only single from ''Hannah Montana'' on March 28, 2006. It reached number 92 on the U.S. [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]. ''Hannah Montana'' was [[reissue]]d as a two-disc special edition on March 20, 2007. It spawned the additional single "[[Nobody's Perfect (Hannah Montana song)|Nobody's Perfect]]", taken from the series' [[Hannah Montana (season 2)|second season]], and peaked at number 27 on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100. The soundtrack was further promoted during the [[The Cheetah Girls (group)|The Cheetah Girls]]' [[Party's Just Begun Tour]], for which Cyrus served as an opening act, and her own [[Best of Both Worlds Tour]].

During production of the [[Hannah Montana (season 1)|first season]] of ''[[Hannah Montana]]'', Cyrus commented that "right now we're just all really focused on making ''Hannah Montana'' the show as good as it can be, but hopefully in the future there may be a ''Hannah Montana'' soundtrack".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywood.com/static/miley-cyrus-talks-about-her-new-disney-channel-series-hannah-montana|title=Disney Channel's Newest Live-Action Comedy Features Original Musical Performances|author1=Maya Motavalli|author2=Ed Martin|publisher=[[Hollywood.com]]|accessdate=January 20, 2014}}</ref> The series itself premiered through the [[Disney Channel]] on March 24, 2006, and became an immediate commercial success; with 5.4 million viewers, the [[Lilly, Do You Want to Know a Secret?|pilot episode]] earned the channel the highest ratings in its history at the time.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/life/television/news/2007-01-10-miley-cyrus_x.htm|title=Miley Cyrus fulfills her destiny|author=Ann Oldenburg|newspaper=[[USA Today]]|publisher=[[Gannett Company]]|date=January 14, 2007|accessdate=January 20, 2014}}</ref> The following month, it was reported that an accompanying soundtrack and Cyrus' debut [[studio album]] had both begun production, the first of which was scheduled to be released during fall 2006. These plans were expected to capitalize on promotional efforts previously used for [[Hilary Duff]], who had successfully transitioned from the titular character on the television series ''[[Lizzie McGuire]]'' into a career in the music industry in the early 2000s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2006/04/20/arts/television/20cyru.html?_r=0|title=Hannah Montana and Miley Cyrus: A Tale of Two Tweens|author=Jacuqes Steinberg|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|publisher=[[The New York Times Company]]|date=April 20, 2006|accessdate=January 20, 2014}}</ref>

In the series, Cyrus portrays the character [[Miley Stewart]], a teenager who lives the secret double life as the pop star [[Miley Stewart#Hannah Montana|Hannah Montana]]. She stated that "most songs for the first season reflect the show, with Miley or Hannah making sure the other doesn't get caught or whatever," opining that the tracks provided series producers with the opportunity to "make sure that everyone understood the characters". By comparison, Cyrus described later material used by the series as "more speaking out to the fans."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1547030/hannah-montana-star-miley-cyrus-next-duff.jhtml|title='Hannah Montana' Star Miley Cyrus Ready To Break Out, Hilary-Style|author=Corey Moss|publisher=[[MTV News]]. [[Viacom]]|date=December 4, 2006|accessdate=January 20, 2014}}</ref> The record incorporates elements of [[teen pop]], [[pop rock]], and [[country pop]] musical styles. Cyrus performs eight of its thirteen tracks, which are credited to Hannah Montana. Her songs "[[The Best of Both Worlds (song)|The Best of Both Worlds]]" and "[[This Is the Life (Hannah Montana song)|This Is the Life]]" describe the double life that Cyrus' character maintains, while "[[If We Were a Movie]]" and "[[I Got Nerve]]" respectively address a romantic desire and "[[girl power]]".<ref name="AllMusic">{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/hannah-montana-mw0000421737|title=Hannah Montana - Hannah Montana|author=Heather Phares|publisher=[[AllMusic]].

"Pop Princess" by [[The Click Five]] was described by Heather Phares from [[AllMusic]] as "sparkly [[power pop]]"; she also characterized "Finder Yourself in You" by [[Everlife]] as "the template for Hannah's rock-edged pop". The soundtrack closes the [[country pop]] duet "I Learned From You" between Cyrus and her father [[Billy Ray Cyrus]], which Phares felt drew influences from recording artist [[Vanessa Carlton]].<ref name="AllMusic"/> The soundtrack was later [[reissue]]d as a two-disc special edition, which saw the inclusion of the track "[[Nobody's Perfect (Hannah Montana song)|Nobody's Perfect]]",<ref name="SpecialEdition">{{cite web|url=http://www.amazon.com/Hannah-Montana-Special-Edition-Soundtrack/dp/B000N4SA8W|title=Hannah Montana: 2-Disc Special Edition Soundtrack [Extra Tracks, Soundtrack, Special Edition]|publisher=[[Amazon.com]] (US)|accessdate=January 20, 2014}}</ref> which was later featured on the following soundtrack ''[[Hannah Montana 2: Meet Miley Cyrus]]'' (2007).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/hannah-montana-2-meet-miley/id257915495|title=iTunes - Music - Hannah Montana 2: Meet Miley Cyrus by Hannah Montana|publisher=[[iTunes Store]] (US).

''Hannah Montana'' received generally favorable reviews from [[Music journalism|music critics]], who appreciated its overall production. Writing for [[AllMusic]], Heather Phares enjoyed Cyrus' deliveries of "cute, well-written songs", and added that the overall project was "sweet, starry-eyed, [and] utterly charming".<ref name="AllMusic"/> Jennifer Axman from [[Common Sense Media]] shared a similar sentiment, appreciating its "upbeat girl-power messages" and distinguishing "I Learned from You" as a stand-out track for its inspirational lyrics ("I learned from you that I do not crumble / I learned from you that strength is something you choose /.../ There is no question that's a lesson I learned from you").<ref name="CSM">{{cite web|url=http://www.commonsensemedia.org/music-reviews/hannah-montana-soundtrack|title=Hannah Montana Soundtrack|author=Jennifer Axman|publisher=[[Common Sense Media]]|accessdate=January 20, 2014}}</ref> [[MSN Music]] gave the record a 3.5 out of 5 stars, and listed it as an "essential album".<ref name="MSNMusic">{{cite web|url=http://music.msn.com/music/album/hannah-montana/hannah-montana.3/|title=Hannah Montana by Hannah Montana on MSN Music|publisher=[[MSN Music]].

==Commercial performance==
During the week of October 25, initial sales projections recognized ''Hannah Montana'', ''[[The Black Parade]]'' by [[My Chemical Romance]], and ''[[Once Again (John Legend album)|Once Again]]'' by [[John Legend]] as the most-likely records that would reach number one on the U.S. [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]].
