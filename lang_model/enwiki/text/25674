'''''Prostanthera aspalathoides''''', commonly known as '''Scarlet Mint-bush''',  is a shrub that is native to south-eastern Australia <ref name=NSW>{{cite web |url=http://plantnet.rbgsyd.nsw.gov.au/cgi-bin/NSWfl.pl?page=nswfl&lvl=sp&name=Prostanthera~aspalathoides |title=''Prostanthera aspalathoides'' |accessdate=1 June 2011|author=|work= PlantNET - New South Wales Flora Online |publisher=Royal Botanic Gardens & Domain Trust, Sydney Australia}}</ref>  It has a compact habit, growing to between 0.3 and 1 metre high. The aromatic leaves are terete to linear-elliptic in shape and are 1.5 to 6 mm long and 0.5 to 1 mm wide.<ref name=NSW/><ref name=Greig>{{cite book|author=Greig, D.| title=The Australian Gardener's Wildflower Catalogue| publisher=Angus & Robertson|location= Australia | year=1987 | id=ISBN 0207154600}}</ref> Flowers occur throughout the year, but are most profuse in late spring.<ref name=Greig/> These are solitary and axillary, forming a tube that is  8 to 11 mm long and may be coloured red, pink-red, orange or yellow.<ref name=NSW/>

The species was formally described by botanist [[Allan Cunningham]] in 1834 based on plant material collected in the vicinity of the [[Lachlan River]] in [[New South Wales]]<ref name =APNI>{{cite web |url=http://www.anbg.gov.au/cgi-bin/apni?TAXON_NAME=Prostanthera+aspalathoides|title= ''Prostanthera aspalathoides'' |accessdate=1 June 2012 | work=[[Australian Plant Name Index]] (APNI), IBIS database|publisher = Centre for Plant Biodiversity Research, Australian Government, Canberra}}</ref> It occurs in [[New South Wales]] and [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] and [[South Australia]].<ref name=APNI/> The specific epithet alludes to a similarity to plants of the genus ''[[Aspalathus]]''.<ref name=ANPSA/>

''Prosthanthera aspalthioides'' is best adapted to cultivation in dry conditions with low humidity. Plants prefer a position in full sun or partial shade with good drainage and withstand moderate frost.<ref name=ANPSA/><ref name=Greig/>

Cuttings are the preferred propagation method, as seed germinates slowly. Plants may also be grafted on roostocks of the hardier species'' [[Prostanthera nivea]]''.<ref name=ANPSA>{{cite web|title=''Prostanthera aspalthoides''|publisher=Australian Native Plants Society (Australia)|url=http://asgap.org.au/p-asp.html|accessdate=1 June 2012}}</ref>
