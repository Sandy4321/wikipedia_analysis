'''Jesper Blomqvist''' (born 5 February 1974) is a [[Sweden|Swedish]] [[association football|football]] player, currently a player-coach for [[Enk<U+00F6>pings SK|Enk<U+00F6>ping]] in the [[Superettan]] league. He played at [[IFK G<U+00F6>teborg]], where he won four straight [[Allsvenskan]] league titles between 1993<U+2013>96, and [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]], where he was part of the team that won a [[The Treble|treble]] in 1999, consisting of the [[FA Premier League]], [[FA Cup]] and [[UEFA Champions League]]. He returned to Swedish football in 2003 with [[Djurg<U+00E5>rdens IF Fotboll|Djurg<U+00E5>rden]], where he won his final Allsvenskan title, before initially retiring in 2005. An injury crisis prompted a playing return for Enk<U+00F6>ping in 2008. Blomqvist has made 30 international appearances for [[Sweden national football team|Sweden]] and helped them to third place at the [[1994 FIFA World Cup]] in the [[United States]].

==Club career==
===Swedish football===
After an early spell at Tavelsj<U+00F6> IK, Blomqvist signed for recently formed [[Ume<U+00E5> FC]] in 1992. In the spring portion of his first season for the club, he helped them to the [[Swedish Division 2|Division 2 Norra Norrland]] title, promoting the club to [[Division 1 Norra]] for the autumn.<ref>{{citeweb|url=http://www.geocities.com/clasglenning/Svenska_fotbollstabeller/sweden_third_level_1992.htm|title=Division 2 (3rd level) 1992|accessdate=2008-08-16|work=Clas Glenning, RSSSF}}</ref> At the time this was the second tier of Swedish football.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ufc.se/index.asp?page=357 |title=Ume<U+00E5> FC |accessdate=2008-08-15 |publisher=Ume<U+00E5> FC|language=Swedish}}</ref> Subsequently, he signed for [[IFK G<U+00F6>teborg]] on 11 September 1993. Blomqvist played a part in the club's [[Allsvenskan]] win that year. He scored eight goals in 24 league appearances en route to the league title in 1994.<ref name="Career2001">{{citeweb |url=http://www.sporting-heroes.net/football-heroes/displayhero_club.asp?HeroID=16022 |title=Jesper Blomqvist-Manchester United FC |accessdate=2008-08-15|publisher=www.sporting-heroes.net}}</ref> Furthermore, he played a part in [[Swedish national football team|Sweden's]] advance to the semi finals of the [[1994 World Cup|World Cup]] and scored in the club's 3&ndash;1 win over Manchester United in the [[UEFA Champions League 1994-95|Champions League]], knocking them out of the competition.<ref>{{citeweb|url=http://www.uefa.com/competitions/ucl/history/season=1994/round=64/group=7.html|title=UEFA Champions League|accessdate=2008-08-15|publisher=UEFA}}</ref> This performance caught the eye of United manager [[Alex Ferguson]] and helped the team qualify for the quarter finals of the tournament. Another title followed in 1995, with Blomqvist's goal against [[Helsingborgs]] voted goal of the season.<ref name="player awards">{{citeweb|url=http://www.svenskfotboll.se/t2svff.aspx?p=152388|title=Swedish player awards|accessdate=2008-08-27|publisher=Swedish FA|language=Swedish}}</ref> In his last season for G<U+00F6>teborg, he played against former club Ume<U+00E5>, who had reached the Allsvenskan for the first time in their history. In 1996, Blomqvist was voted Fan's Player of the Year and Midfielder of the Year.<ref name="player awards"/> At the end of the 1996 season, he signed for newly crowned [[Serie A]] champions [[A.C. Milan]].

===Serie A===
In his first season of Italian football, Milan failed to win a trophy, and Blomqvist often sat on the bench. He nearly decided against going to [[Old Trafford]] because he did not want a repeat of this season.<ref>{{citeweb |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4158/is_19980718/ai_n14179260?tag=artBody;col1 |title=Blomqvist unhappy at sub's role|accessdate=2008-08-15|work=The London Independent|publisher=Newspaper Publishing PLC|date=18 July 1998}}</ref> The defending champions had an equally disappointing season, finishing [[Serie A 1996-97|11th in Serie A]] and failing to qualify for European football. Blomqvist was subsequently sold to Serie A runners up [[Parma F.C.]] in the summer of 1997. Blomqvist enjoyed more regular football, although the club finished 6th in the league and missed out on the knockout stages of the [[UEFA Champions League 1997<U+2013>98#Group A|Champions League]]. The Swede's sole league goal for the club was scored in a 4&ndash;0 win over [[Napoli FC|Napoli]] at [[Stadio San Paolo]].<ref>{{citeweb|url=http://www.rsssf.com/tablesi/ital98.html|title=Italy Championship 1997/98|accessdate=2008-08-15|work=Maurizio Mariani|publisher=RSSSF}}</ref>

===Premier League===
{{see also|Manchester United F.C. season 1998-99}}
Manchester United purchased Blomqvist as a backup to [[Ryan Giggs]] in 1998, for a fee of <U+00A3>4.4 million.<ref>{{citeweb|url=http://soccernet.espn.go.com/archive/england/players/BlomqvistJesper.html|title=Soccernet England:Jesper Blomqvist|accessdate=2008-08-15|publisher=Soccernet}}</ref> He featured in enough games to win a [[Premier League]] winner's medal in [[FA Premier League 1998<U+2013>99|the 1999 season]], scoring his only goal for the club in a game against Everton.<ref name="toffee">{{citeweb|url=http://www.toffeeweb.com/players/past/Blomqvist.asp|title=Jesper Blomqvist player profile|accessdate=2008-08-15}}</ref> He received an [[FA Cup]] winners medal despite being an unused substitute in the [[1999 FA Cup Final|final]]. He, however, started against [[Bayern Munich]] in the [[1999 UEFA Champions League Final|Champions League final]]. He came close to scoring before eventually being replaced by [[Teddy Sheringham]], who later scored, equalising the match after Bayern's early goal. United went on to win the match 2&ndash;1.<ref>{{citeweb|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sport/football/353842.stm|title=United crowned kings of Europe|accessdate=2008-08-15|date=26 May 1999|publisher=BBC}}</ref> 

Due to a serious knee injury, Blomqvist did not play football in the next two seasons, which resulted in Manchester United deciding not to renew his contract. Nonetheless, Ferguson persuaded Everton manager [[Walter Smith]] to offer the Swedish international a short term contract at [[Goodison Park]], from November 2001 until the end of the season.<ref>{{citeweb|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/e/everton/1642562.stm|title=Smith confirms Blomqvist deal|accessdate=2008-08-15|work=Phil McNulty|publisher=BBC|date=7 November 2001}}</ref> Blomqvist played on the [[Midfielder#Winger|wings]] alongside compatriot [[Niclas Alexandersson]]. Injury problems persisted, however, and new manager [[David Moyes]] allowed him to leave the club in June 2002. He had a trial at [[Middlesbrough F.C.|Middlesbrough]], but was unhappy with the club's handling of the situation, labelling it "a bit unprofessional".<ref>{{citeweb|url=http://archive.thenorthernecho.co.uk/2002/9/1/122416.html|title=Winger Blomqvist snubs "unprofessional" Boro|accessdate=2008-08-15|publisher=The Northern Echo|date=1 September 2002}}</ref> Instead he signed for [[Alan Curbishley]]'s [[Charlton Athletic]] on a free transfer, for whom he made three league appearances.

===Return to Sweden===
Again struggling with injury, Blomqvist returned to his native Sweden after only four games with Charlton. He signed on a short term deal with [[Djurg<U+00E5>rdens IF Fotboll|Djurg<U+00E5>rdens IF]].<ref>{{citeweb|url=http://soccernet.espn.go.com/news/story?id=271402&cc=5739|title=Sweden's Djurgarde sign Blomqvist|access date=2008-08-15|publisher=ESPNsoccernet|date=11 July 2003}}</ref> This proved unpopular among supporters of IFK G<U+00F6>teborg, who labelled him "Judas". G<U+00F6>teborg fans considered the decision to join Djurg<U+00E5>rden instead of them a betrayal.<ref>{{citeweb|url=http://www2.unt.se/avd/1,1826,MC=4-AV_ID=792744,00.html|title=Blomqvist ska s<U+00E4>nka sin gamla klubb|publisher=unt.se|accessdate=2008-09-14|date=27 August 2008|work=Carl G<U+00F6>ransson|language=Swedish}}</ref> Blomqvist played a part as the side became Swedish champions that year. Injury problems, however, restricted him to only nine league appearances. As during the stint with Manchester United, he remained at the club for another two seasons, before finally deciding to retire due to injury in 2005.<ref name="toffee"/>

Blomqvist joined [[Enk<U+00F6>pings SK]] as a coach in 2008 and has since made a playing return in the [[Superettan]], the second tier of Swedish football. Ironically, a shortage of players at the club due to injury forced Blomqvist's playing return. The player shortage was highlighted when Blomqvist was sent off in his second game for the club. This resulted in a suspension for Blomqvist, and Enk<U+00F6>ping only having fifteen players available for the following match.<ref>{{citeweb|url=http://www.svenskfotboll.se/t3supre.aspx?p=152185&scr=result&fmid=724693|title=Match information:Mjallby AIF 3:0 Enkoping|accessdate=2008-08-15|publisher=Swedish FA|language=Swedish}}</ref> As of September 2008, he is still playing for Enk<U+00F6>ping.<ref>{{citeweb|url=http://www.svenskfotboll.se/t3supre.aspx?p=152185&scr=result&fmid=724814|title=Match Report:V<U+00E4>sby United vs Enk<U+00F6>pings SK|accessdate=2008-09-13|publisher=Swedish FA}}</ref>

==International career==
Blomqvist was part of the bronze medal-winning [[Sweden national football team|Swedish national team]] at the [[1994 FIFA World Cup]]. He made his debut was against Columbia in 1994.<ref>{{citeweb|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4158/is_19950226/ai_n13968157|title=Eight players who can illuminate this weeks quarter final|accessdate=2008-08-15|date=26 February 1995|publisher=The Independent London}}</ref> His only World Cup start came against Cameroon, although he also replaced [[Henrik Larsson]] in the second half of a draw against eventual champions Brazil.<ref>{{citeweb|url=http://www.fifa.com/worldcup/archive/edition=84/results/matches/match=3080/report.html|title=Brazil - Sweden|accessdate=2008-08-15|publisher=FIFA}}</ref> Each member of the squad was awarded a [[Svenska Dagbladet Gold Medal]] in recognition of their third place in the tournament. Blomqvist was also considered for the [[2002 World Cup]] squad.<ref>{{citeweb|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/e/everton/1760187.stm|title=Blomqvist in world cup frame|accessdate=2008-08-15|date=14 January 2002|publisher=BBC}}</ref> In total, Blomqvist has made 30 [[cap (football)|appearances]] for his country, without scoring.

==Personal life==
Blomqvist was born and raised in Tavelsj<U+00F6>, in the [[Ume<U+00E5> Municipality]] of Sweden. He once dated female international footballer [[Tina Nordlund]], who has also played for Ume<U+00E5>. Their relationship ended in 2000.<ref>{{citeweb|url=http://www.tidningenhennes.se/Aldre-hennes-historia/hennes-historia-nr-10-2006/|title=Jag var en knarkare p<U+00E5> jakt efter n<U+00E4>sta kick|accessdate=2008-09-14|work=Sofia Benholm|language=Swedish}}</ref> He currently resides in Sweden, although he has also purchased property in [[Croatia]].<ref>{{citeweb|url=http://origin.skysports.com/story/0,19528,11684_2269122,00.html|title=Jesper eyes Swedish return|accessdate=2008-09-09|publisher=Sky Sports}}</ref> After officially retiring in 2005, he became a [[pundit (expert)|pundit]] (football expert) for Swedish television station [[TV4 (Sweden)|TV4]]. Blomqvist was the victim of an assault during a visit to his hometown [[Ume<U+00E5>]] in September 2006, when he was struck twice across the face. His attacker was prosecuted for the incident.<ref>{{citeweb|url=http://fotbollskanalen.se/1.441194|title=Blomqvist attacker prosecuted|accessdate=2008-09-09|publisher=TV4|language=Swedish}}</ref>
