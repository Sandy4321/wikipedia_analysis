The '''caracal''' {{IPAc-en|<U+02C8>|k|<U+00E6>r|<U+0259>|k|<U+00E6>|l}} (''Caracal caracal''), also known as the '''desert lynx''', is a wild [[Felidae|cat]] widely distributed across [[Africa]], [[Central Asia]], and [[Southwest Asia]] into [[India]]. In 2002, the [[IUCN]] listed the caracal as [[Least Concern]], as it is widespread and relatively common. The felid is considered threatened in [[North Africa]], and rare in the central Asian republics and India.<ref name=iucn>{{IUCN |assessors= Breitenmoser, C., Henschel, P. and Sogbohossou, E.|year=2008 |id=3847 |title= Caracal caracal |version=2012.2}}</ref>

The [[Specific name (zoology)|specific name]] is attributed to the German scientist [[Johann Christian Daniel von Schreber]] who described ''Felis caracal'' in 1776 from a specimen collected near the [[Table Mountain]], [[South Africa]], which is considered the [[Type locality (biology)#type locality|type locality]] of the [[Species (biology)|species]].<ref>{{cite journal |authors=Allen, J.

The caracal has been classified variously with ''[[Lynx]]'' and ''[[Felis]]'' in the past, but [[Molecular biology|molecular]] evidence supports a [[monophyletic]] genus closely allied with the [[African golden cat]] and [[serval]].<ref>{{cite journal |last=Johnson |first=W.

==Etymology==
The word 'caracal' is derived from the [[Turkish language|Turkish]] words ''kara kulak'', which means "black ear".<ref name =Geptner/><ref>Zargan (2001-2012).

==Taxonomy and evolution==
The caracal became first known to science through [[Walter Charleton]] in 1677.<ref>Buffon, G.-L. (1766). [http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k974985/f290.image Le Caracal].

Results of multiple [[Genetic analysis|genetic analyses]] indicates that the caracal shared a common ancestor with the [[African golden cat]] around 4.85 million years ago.<ref name=WCoW/>

==Characteristics==
The caracal is distinguished from ''Felis'' by the presence of a long tuft on the tip of the [[ear]]s, exceeding half their length. No trace of pattern remains in the coat, except a few spots on the underside and inside of the fore legs.<ref name= Pocock1939 />
It is a slender, long-legged cat of medium size with a relatively short [[tail]]. The [[fur]] on the back and sides is generally of a uniform tawny grey or reddish, frosted-sand colour. The belly and the undersides of the legs and chest are whitish and spotted or blotched with pale markings. The tufted ears are black-backed. [[Melanism|Black]] caracals also occur. The [[skull]] is high and rounded. The jaw is short, stoutly built, and equipped with large, powerful teeth. About 92% of caracals lack the second upper [[premolar]] teeth. Males reach a head and body length of {{convert|75|to|105.7|cm|in|abbr=on}}, with a 23.1- to 34-cm-long tail, and weigh {{convert|8.0|to|20|kg|lb|abbr=on}}. Females are smaller with a head and body length of {{convert|69|to|102.9|cm|in|abbr=on}} and a tail {{convert|19.5|to|34|cm|in|abbr=on}} long. They weigh from {{convert|7.0|to|15.9|kg|lb|abbr=on}}.<ref name=WCoW>{{cite book |author=Sunquist, M. |author2=Sunquist, F. |year=2002 |title= Wild cats of the World |publisher=University of Chicago Press |location= Chicago |pages= 37<U+2013>47|isbn= 0-226-77999-8 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=hFbJWMh9-OAC&pg=PA37&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q&f=true}}</ref>

Facial markings comprise a dark line running down the center of the forehead to near the nose, and another one running from the inner edge of the [[eye]] to the nostrils. The [[pupil]]s of the eyes contract to form circles. A light-colored ring encircles the eyes, and a rather indistinct dark brown patch occurs over each eye. White patches occur on either side of the nose. The inner surface of the [[Pinna (anatomy)|pinna]] is covered with small white hairs. Numerous stiff hairs emerge from between the [[pads]] and probably are an adaption for moving through soft sand.<ref name =Geptner>Geptner, V. G., Sludskii, A. A. (1972).

==Ecology and behaviour==
[[File:Caracal caracal -Toronto Zoo, Ontario, Canada-8b.jpg|thumb|Captive caracal]]
Adult caracals are solitary, but they have also been observed in pairs. They produce the usual range of sounds for cats, including growling, hissing, purring, and calling. Unusually, they also make a barking sound, which is possibly used as a warning. They [[scent mark]] their territory, leave [[faeces]] in visible locations, and mark territory by [[spraying (animal behavior)|spraying urine]] onto bushes or logs, or raking it into the ground with their hind feet.<ref name=WCoW/>

Their home ranges are large in arid areas. Three males averaged {{convert|316.4|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}} on Namibian ranchland.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Marker |first=L. L. |last2=Dickman |first2=A.

Home range size was positively correlated with body weight, and negatively correlated with prey availability. Male home ranges overlapped substantially (50%), and typically included those of several females. Two dispersals were observed: a male migrated {{convert|60|to|90|km|mi|abbr=on}} south before establishing a home range, whereas a female remained in the vicinity of her natal range, with her range partly overlapping that of her mother. Twenty caracals, several of them transients, were found to use an area of {{convert|100|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}} with some ranging outside this area, making for a relatively high local density despite the large home ranges.<ref name=Weisbein>{{cite journal |last=Weisbein |first=Y. |last2=Mendelssohn |first2=H. |year=1990 |title=The biology and ecology of the caracal Felis caracal in the northern Aravah Valley of Israel |journal=Cat News |volume=12 |pages=20<U+2013>22}}</ref> Male home ranges in better-watered environments of South Africa are smaller.

Male home ranges overlapped completely with those of females, whereas female ranges overlapped between zero and 19%. Caracal were active by night and day, and significantly longer on nights colder than 20<U+00B0>C. Males moved more than twice the distance of females during an active period.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Avenant |first=N. L. |last2=Nel |first2=J. A.

Caracals can survive without drinking for a long period<U+2014>their water demand is satisfied with the body fluids of prey. They are known for their ability to capture [[birds]] by leaping {{convert|2|m|ft|abbr=on}} or more into the air from a standing start. They hunt by stalking their prey, approaching within about {{convert|5|m|ft|abbr=on}} before suddenly sprinting. They kill smaller prey with a bite to the nape of the neck, and larger animals by biting the throat and then raking with their claws. They sometimes cover larger prey if they cannot consume the whole carcass in a single meal, and return to it later. Some have even been observed to hide carcasses in trees. They live mainly on prey smaller than {{convert|5|kg|lb|abbr=on}}, including [[hyrax]]es, [[springhare]]s, [[gerbil]]s, [[mouse|mice]], and birds. They are capable of taking [[antelope]]s, including species such as [[mountain reedbuck]], [[springbok]], [[common duiker]], and [[steenbok]].<ref name=WCoW/> Occasionally, they tackle adult [[goitered gazelle]].<ref name =Geptner/>

=== Reproduction and life cycle ===
[[File:Caracal kitten.jpg|thumb|right|Caracal kitten]]
Mating occurs year round.<ref name=Nowell1996/>  In the Sahara, breeding is reported to occur primarily in midwinter.<ref>Dragesco-Joff<U+00E9>, A. (1993). ''La Vie Sauvage au Sahara''. [Wildlife in the Sahara]. Delachaux et Niestl<U+00E9>, Lausanne (Switzerland) and Paris (in French).</ref>
The caracal's [[estrus]] cycle lasts about 14 days, estrus lasts on about 1.8 days.<ref name="SkinnerChimimba2005"/> Females copulate with several males in a "pecking order" which is related to the age and size of the male. One female was found to have mated with three different males during every estrous period, each time with the same individuals in the same sequence.<ref name=Weisbein/> Copulation lasts around 4 minutes.<ref name="SkinnerChimimba2005">{{cite book|author1=J. D. Skinner|author2=Christian T. Chimimba|title=The Mammals of the Southern African Sub-region|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=F23lAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA401|date=15 November 2005|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-107-39405-6|pages=401<U+2013>}}</ref>

[[Gestation]] lasts from 69 to 81 days, and litter size ranges from one to six kittens. Females use caves, tree cavities, or burrows as shelter when giving birth. Newborn kittens weigh {{convert|198|to|250|g|oz|abbr=on}}, and open their eyes between four and 10 days of age. Kittens venture outside the birthing den at around one month of age. Their [[deciduous teeth]] are fully developed at the age of 50 days. They are weaned at about 10 weeks. At around four or five months, the [[Canine tooth|canine teeth]] appear, with the others following over the next six months. The young stay with their mother for up to one year, when they start to reach [[sexual maturity]].<ref name=WCoW/> In the wild, caracals have an average lifespan of 6 years, in captivity, they may live as long as 19 years.<ref name="SilversteinSilverstein2003">{{cite book|author1=Alvin Silverstein|author2=Virginia B.

==Distribution and habitat==
[[File:Caracal hunting in the serengeti.jpg|right|thumb|A caracal hunting]]
Caracals are common in parts of their sub-Saharan range, especially in [[South Africa]] and southern [[Namibia]], where they expand into new, and recolonize vacant, areas. They occur at much lower densities in [[Central Africa|Central]] and [[West Africa]], where the [[carnivore]] community is more diverse. They occupy a wide variety of habitats from [[semidesert]] to relatively open [[savanna]] and [[scrubland]] to moist woodland and thicket or [[evergreen forest|evergreen]] and montane forest such as in the [[Western Cape]] of South Africa. They prefer drier woodland and savanna regions with lower rainfall and some cover.<ref name=iucn />
They also occur in the [[Sahara]]n mountain ranges and semiarid woodlands.<ref name=Nowell1996>Nowell, K. and Jackson, P. (1996). [http://www.catsg.org/catsgportal/cat-website/catfolk/nsacrl01.htm Caracal ''Caracal caracal'']. in: Wild Cats. Status Survey and Conservation Action Plan. IUCN/SSC Cat Specialist Group, Gland, Switzerland and Cambridge, UK.</ref>
On the [[Arabian Peninsula]], caracals occur throughout the mountain ranges and hilly steppe regions, but probably do not penetrate far into the great sand deserts of the interior.<ref>Harrison, D. L., Bates, P. J. J. (1991). ''The Mammals of Arabia''. Second edition. Harrison Zoological Museum, Sevenoaks, England. 354 pp.</ref>

The [[Caspian Sea]], [[Ustyurt Plateau|Ustyurt]], and the [[Aral Sea]] constitute the northern distribution limit of caracals, which barely extends east of the [[Amu Darya]]. In [[Turkmenistan|Turkmenia]], caracals were known from the coastal plains at the mouth of the [[Atrek River]] to the foothills of the [[Kopet-Dag]], along the [[Tedzhen River]], in the deserts along the [[Morghab River (Afghanistan)|Murghab River]] and east of the [[Kushka River]]. Their range extends southeastwards from [[Iran]], through Pakistan and central India as far as [[Uttar Pradesh]].<ref name =Geptner/>

=== Distribution of subspecies ===
[[File:Caracal in South Africa - by Shaun MItchem.jpg|thumb|Caracal in South Africa]]
Subsequent to Schreber's first description of a caracal from South Africa, several subspecies were described, of which these are recognized today:<ref name=MSW3 />

The Russian zoologist Heptner described ''C. c. micha<U+00EB>lis'' in 1945 from the western [[Karakum Desert|Karakum]].<ref name =Geptner/>

==Threats==
[[File:MSU V2P2 - Hunter with caracal.png|thumb|Hunter with caracal. [[Repetek Biosphere State Reserve|Repetek]], eastern [[Karakum Desert|Karakum]], January, 1958]]
Habitat destruction due to [[agriculture]] and [[desertification]] is a significant threat in central, west, north and northeast Africa where caracals are naturally sparsely distributed. It is also likely to be the main threat in the Asian part of its range. As caracals are capable of taking small domestic livestock, they are often subject to persecution. Severity of depredation appears to be dependent on the availability of wild prey and husbandry techniques.<ref name=iucn />

In Iran, the killing of small livestock has brought the caracal into serious conflict with local people, who sometimes make efforts to eradicate it. The cat has never been recorded to be killed in road incidents, and no severe poaching pressure on it appears to happen.<ref name=Farhadinia07>{{cite journal |last=Farhadinia |first=M. S. |author2=Akbari, H. |author3=Beheshti, M. |author4= A.

==Conservation==
Populations in Asian range states are included in [[CITES Appendix I]]; populations in African range states are included in [[CITES Appendix II|Appendix II]]. Hunting of the species is prohibited in [[Afghanistan]], Algeria, Egypt, India, Iran, Israel, Jordan, [[Kazakhstan]], [[Lebanon]], Morocco, Pakistan, Syria, [[Tajikistan]], Tunisia, [[Turkey]], [[Turkmenistan]], and [[Uzbekistan]]. In sub-Saharan Africa, the caracal is protected from hunting in about half of its range states.<ref name=Nowell1996/> In Namibia and South Africa, the caracal is classified as a "problem animal", which permits landowners to kill the species without restriction; nonetheless, caracal have persisted and remain widespread.<ref name=iucn />

=== In captivity ===
As of November 2009, 18 caracals were kept in 12 [[Association of Zoos and Aquariums|AZA]]-accredited institutions participating in the Population Management Plan.<ref>Bray, S. (ed.) (2009). [http://nationalzoo.si.edu/SCBI/AZA/FelidTAG/Newsletter/2009November.pdf "Caracal PMP"].''Felid TAG Times'', November 2009: p. 5.</ref> In 1998, a caracal was [[Cross-breeding|hybridised]] with a [[domestic cat]] at the [[Moscow Zoo]].<ref>{{cite journal | author = Kusminych, I. and Pawlowa, A. | title = Ein Bastard von Karakal Hauskatze im Moskauer Zoo | journal = Der Zoologische Garten | volume = 68 | issue = 4 | year = 1998}}</ref> 

Historically, caracals have been used in India for [[hunting]] and blood sports. A popular sport in India was to have a captive caracal set upon a flock of [[pigeons]], whereupon bets were made on how many birds could be taken down by the cat. A practised caracal could ground as many as a dozen birds. Today, as well as in the past, caracals have occasionally been kept as [[exotic pet]]s in Africa, India, [[North America]] and elsewhere.<ref>{{cite book|authors=Hall-Martin, A., Bosman, P. |title=Cats of Africa |year=1997 |publisher=Fernwood Press, South Africa|isbn=1 874950 24 5 |pages=152}}</ref> It has been claimed caracals are "suitable as pets" because they are "easily tamed",<ref name="SilversteinSilverstein2003"/> but caracals have also been claimed to attack people other than their owner.<ref name="MorroneEllis-Bell2010">{{cite book|author1=Morrone, M. |author2=Ellis-Bell, N. |title=A Man for All Species: The Remarkable Adventures of an Animal Lover and Expert Pet Keeper |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=KGqPYrTgdZsC&pg=PA152 |year=2010 |publisher=Crown Publishing Group |location=New York |isbn=978-0-307-58966-8 |page=152}}</ref>

== Cultural depictions==
Caracals appear to have held some religious significance for the ancient [[Egyptian culture|Egyptians]]. They were found in wall paintings, their bodies embalmed, and sculptures of caracals and other cats guarded tombs.<ref>{{cite book|author=Kingdon, J.|year=1977|title=East African Mammals: An Atlas of Evolution in Africa, Volume IIIA: Carnivores|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=me0OmRYFRkcC&printsec=frontcover&sa=X&ei=94cCUfzlD-X74QSMpoHYBQ&ved=0CCsQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q&f=false|publisher=Academic Press, London}}</ref>
