== Synopsis ==
April, 1994. Genocide in [[Rwanda]]. 800,000 dead. A catastrophe that upset the balance in the entire region. The Great Lakes region of Africa ended the year with a bloodbath. This documentary shows the intrigues, the dramatic effects, the treasons, the vengeances that prevailed over those years and whose only goal was to maintain or increase each faction<U+2019>s area of influence. In just ten years, the population saw all their hopes vanish: The dream of an Africa in control of its own destiny, alimentary self-sufficiency, the end of interethnic conflicts.<ref name="olivier"/><ref name=ARTE>{{cite news|last=Brard|first=Caroline|title=Interview Jihan El Tahri|url=http://www.arte.tv/fr/Interview-Jihan-El-Tahri/364158,CmC=364162.html|accessdate=10 March 2012|newspaper=[[ARTE France]]|date=29 March 2004}}</ref>
