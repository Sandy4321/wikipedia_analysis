The '''Flemish Heraldic Council''' or '''Vlaamse Heraldische Raad''' is the part of the Monuments and Sites Division of the [[Flanders|Flemish]] government responsible for granting [[Coat of arms|coats of arms]] and [[flag]]s. Established on [[April 11]], [[1984]], it is the successor to the ''Subcommissie Heraldiek'' (Subcommittee for Heraldry), established in [[1978]]. Both bodies were originally responsible for granting arms and flags to [[Commune (subnational entity)|communes]]. In [[1994]] the council's authority was extended to [[Province|provincial]] arms and flags, and in [[2000]] it was authorized to grant coats of arms to Flemish individuals and corporations.
