'''''The Skywhale''''' is a [[hot air balloon]] designed by the sculptor [[Patricia Piccinini]] as part of a commission to mark the centenary of the city of [[Canberra]]. It was built by [[Cameron Balloons]] in Bristol, and first flew in Australia in 2013. The balloon's design received a mixed response after it was publicly unveiled in May 2013.

==Development==

Ahead of the centenary of the Australian national capital city of [[Canberra]] in 2013, the creative director of the centenary celebrations, [[Robyn Archer]], commissioned the sculptor [[Patricia Piccinini]] in 2010 to develop a balloon.<ref name="whale of a commission">{{cite web|title=Sculpture as hot-air balloon - a whale of a commission|url=http://www.cmd.act.gov.au/open_government/inform/act_government_media_releases/cmcd/2013/sculpture-as-hot-air-balloon-a-whale-of-a-commission|work=Media release|publisher=ACT Chief Minister and Cabinet Directorate|accessdate=12 May 2013}}</ref><ref name="blowing in the wind" /> Piccinini grew up in Canberra and completed a degree in economics at the [[Australian National University]] before becoming a successful sculptor.<ref name="Skywhale takes off">{{cite news|last=Nicholson|first=Larissa|title=Skywhale takes off|url=http://www.canberratimes.com.au/act-news/skywhale-takes-off-20130511-2jejt.html|accessdate=12 May 2013|newspaper=The Canberra Times|date=12 May 2013|coauthors=Kretowicz, Ewa}}</ref><ref name="Roslyn_Oxley9_bio">{{cite web|title=Patricia Piccinini|url=http://www.roslynoxley9.com.au/artists/31/Patricia_Piccinini/profile/|publisher=Roslyn Oxley9 Gallery|accessdate=12 May 2013}}</ref> She has received praise for creating highly realistic sculptures of human-like living creatures, and her work has been exhibited worldwide.<ref name=Roslyn_Oxley9_bio /><ref name="Afternoon delight" /> Archer selected Piccinini for the project in recognition of the sculptor's connections to Canberra; other prominent former Canberrans have also been asked to participate in the centenary celebrations.<ref name="blowing in the wind" /> Piccinini had not previously designed a balloon.<ref name="Afternoon delight" /> 

Piccinini's intention when designing the balloon was to fashion it as sculpture of a living creature rather than a "balloon that looked like something".<ref name="The process">{{cite web|title=The process|url=http://www.theskywhale.com/process.html|work=The Skywhale official website|accessdate=12 May 2013}}</ref> She was inspired by the [[planned city|planned]] nature of Canberra, and has described the work as:
{{quote|"My question is what if evolution went a different way and instead of going back into the sea, from which they came originally, they went into the air and we evolved a nature that could fly instead of swim. In fact coming from a place like Canberra where it's a planned city that's really tried to integrate and blend in with the natural environment, it makes a lot of sense to make this sort of huge, gigantic, but artificial and natural-looking creature".<ref name="Skywhale price tag">{{cite news|title=Skywhale price tag could hit $300k|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2013-05-10/skywhale-could-cost-up-to-300k/4681892|accessdate=12 May 2013|newspaper=ABC News|date=10 May 2013}}</ref>}}

The official website of ''The Skywhale'' describes Piccinini's design as follows:
{{quote|Wings didn't make sense to Patricia; the creature was too big and the technical limitations of balloon design wouldn't allow them anyway. So she took a cue from the balloon itself, and imagined that the creature might somehow secrete a lighter than air gas. In the place of wings she imagined huge udders that might contain the gas, as well as a huge bulbous body. She imagined the creature with a slightly more human face, with a calm benign expression that would inspire empathy rather than fear. Her aim was to create a being that was massive and wondrous and that exists somewhere between the impossible and the unlikely.<ref name="The process" />}}

==Construction==

After developing her design, Piccinini and her studio developed a 3D model of the balloon using [[computer-aided design]] software. This process was used to address the technical issues involved with developing a balloon which was safe to fly, as well as to fine-tune the appearance of the design.<ref name="The process" /> The Australian Capital Territory's government invited five specialist balloon manufacturers to submit proposals to construct ''The Skywhale'', but the [[Bristol]]-based company [[Cameron Balloons]] was the only one to provide a bid.<ref name="Skywhale flown to UK" /> 

Once the initial design was complete it was passed to Cameron Balloons which further developed the plans in consultation with Piccinini.<ref name="The process" /> The final design was for a {{convert|34|m|ft}} high and {{convert|23|m|ft}} long balloon capable of a carrying a pilot and two passengers to a maximum altitude of {{convert|3000|ft|m}}. The balloon weighs half a tonne and includes more than 3.5 square kilometres of fabric. It took a team of six workers seven months to complete the balloon.<ref name="whale of a commission" /><ref name="The process" /> Due to its large size, ''The Skywhale'' is slower to ascend and descend than traditional balloons.<ref name="Skywhale will grow on you" /> The total construction cost was $A172,000 and the balloon has a lifespan of about 100 flights.<ref name="Skywhale price tag" /><ref name="Skywhale tale grows" />  

''The Skywhale'' arrived in Australia in early 2013, and made its initial test flight near [[Mount Arapiles]] in Victoria during April that year. Piccinini was a passenger on this flight, an experience she described as "awe inspiring". However, as the balloon's basket is small and has low walls she also reported feeling at danger of falling out of it during the flight.<ref name="Afternoon delight">{{cite news|last=Cuthbertson|first=Debbie|title=Afternoon delight|url=http://www.theage.com.au/entertainment/afternoon-delight-20130509-2jaha.html|accessdate=12 May 2013|newspaper=The Age|date=9 May 2013}}</ref> Some of the balloon's stitching came loose during this flight, and it was air freighted back to Bristol at the expense of Cameron Balloons to be repaired.<ref name="Skywhale flown to UK">{{cite news|last=Jean|first=Peter|coauthors=Towell, Noel and McIlroy, Tom|title=Skywhale flown to UK for emergency surgery|url=http://www.canberratimes.com.au/act-news/skywhale-flown-to-uk-for-emergency-surgery-20130513-2jimr.html|accessdate=14 May 2013|newspaper=The Canberra Times|date=14 May 2013}}</ref>

She also believes that ''The Skywhale'' is likely to win greater support once Canberrans see it in person.<ref name="blowing in the wind" /><ref name="Is it a bird" /> 

The cost of the balloon and the arrangements under which it was funded also attracted criticism. The executive director of culture for the ACT Chief Minister<U+2019>s directorate informed the media on 9 May that the balloon and its supporting website cost about $170,000. Documents released the next day showed that the total cost to the government of commissioning and operating ''The Skywhale'' over its lifespan will be $300,000, and the philanthropic [[Aranday Foundation]] will provide a further $50,000. Moreover, the balloon will remain the property of the Melbourne-based company [[Global Ballooning]] and only one flight was scheduled for Canberra at the time.<ref name="Skywhale tale grows" /> In response, Jeremy Hanson stated that "this $300,000 extravagance again shows out of touch the ACT Government is with Canberrans' priorities".<ref name="Skywhale price tag" /> Katy Gallagher has stated that the Government considered retaining ownership of the balloon during its development, but decided against this option as it would have also involved funding all of ''The Skywhale''{{'}}s operating costs.<ref name="Libs fuming">{{cite news|last=Jean|first=Peter|title=Libs fuming over 'Hindenboob disaster'|url=http://www.canberratimes.com.au/act-news/libs-fuming-over-hindenboob-disaster-20130514-2jk1s.html|accessdate=14 May 2013|newspaper=The Canberra Times|date=14 May 2013}}</ref> Robyn Archer defended the project, arguing that the balloon's cost was relatively low, and represented "a bargain for public art".<ref name="Skywhale tale grows" /><ref name="Skywhale under fire" /> Piccinini has also said that "it's an aeronautical machine. People's lives depend on it. It has to function properly and that's what it costs, to make a balloon".<ref name="blowing in the wind">{{cite news|last=Anderson|first=Stephanie|title=Answers to balloon blowing in the wind|url=http://www.canberratimes.com.au/act-news/answers-to-balloon-blowing-in-the-wind-20130510-2jdzz.html|accessdate=12 May 2013|newspaper=The Canberra Times|date=11 May 2013}}</ref> While Global Ballooning owns ''The Skywhale'', Piccinini retains the intellectual property to the balloon and the company does not expect to make much money from displaying and operating it. The director of Global Ballooning believes that ''The Skywhale'' will become self funding when international galleries begin to exhibit it.<ref name="Skywhale will grow on you">{{cite news|last=Nicholson|first=Larissa|title=Skywhale will grow on you, says pilot|url=http://www.canberratimes.com.au/act-news/skywhale-will-grow-on-you-says-pilot-20130512-2jggn.html|accessdate=13 May 2013|newspaper=The Canberra Times|date=13 May 2013}}</ref> 

''The Skywhale''{{'}}s first flight in Canberra took place on 11 May 2013, with the balloon flying from the grounds of the [[National Gallery of Australia]] to the [[National Museum of Australia]] on the other side of [[Lake Burley Griffin]].
