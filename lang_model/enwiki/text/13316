'''Sydney sandstone''', the common name for '''[[Sydney Basin]] Hawkesbury Sandstone''', is a [[sedimentary rock]] named after the [[Hawkesbury River]] north of Sydney, where this [[sandstone]] is particularly common. It forms the [[bedrock]] for much of the region of [[Sydney, Australia]]. Well known for its durable quality, it is the reason many Aboriginal rock carvings and drawings in the area still exist. 

It is a highly favoured building material, especially preferred during the city's early years, from the late 1790s to the 1890s. Its use, particularly in public buildings, gives the city its distinctive appearance. The stone is notable for its geological characteristics; its relationship to Sydney's vegetation and topography; the history of the quarries that worked it; and the quality of the buildings and sculptures constructed from it. This bedrock gives the city some of its 'personality' by dint of its meteorological, horticultural, aesthetic and historical impact. One author describes Sydney's sandstone as 'a kind of base note, an ever-present reminder of its Georgian beginnings and more ancient past.' <ref>  Falconer, Delia ''Sydney'', University of New South Wales Press, 2010 p.3 ISBN 1921410922 9781921410925</ref>

Sydney sandstone dates from the [[Triassic Period]] <ref>Fairley, 2000 p. 19</ref> and is the [[caprock]] which controls the erosion and [[scarp retreat]] of the [[Illawarra escarpment]]. Six kilometres of sandstone and shale lie under Sydney. Geologists can determine the direction from which ancient rivers brought the sediment that formed the stone by looking at the ripple marks on it. In Sydney sandstone, the ripple marks from the ancient river that brought the grains of sand are distinctive and easily seen, telling geologists that the sand comes from rocks formed between 500 to 700 million years ago far to the south. This means that the highest part of the visible lines almost always faces approximately south.<ref>Flannery, Tim,'The Sandstone City' in ''The Birth of Sydney,'' The Text Publishing Company, 1999 p8-9 ISBN 1876485450</ref> It is a very porous stone and acts as a giant filter. It is composed of very pure [[silicon dioxide|silica]] grains and a small amount of the iron mineral [[siderite]] in varying proportions, bound with a clay matrix.<ref>Flannery, Tim; 'The Stone', in Deirmendjian, 2002.</ref> It oxidises to the warm yellow-brown colour that is notable in the buildings which are constructed of it.

In the late nineteenth century, it was thought that the sandstone might contain [[Gold|gold]]. Some efforts were made at the [[University of Sydney|University]] to test this idea. Reporting on them in 1892, Professor Liversidge said "The Hawkesbury sandstone and Waianamatta shale was, of course, derived from older and probably gold-bearing rocks hence it was not unreasonable to expect to find gold in them." <ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article13970915 |title=ROYAL SOCIETY. |newspaper=[[Sydney_morning_herald|The Sydney Morning Herald (NSW : 1842-1954)]] |location=NSW |date=4 October 1894 |accessdate=13 January 2011 |page=6 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}</ref> 

The sandstone is the basis the nutrient-poor soils found in Sydney that developed over millennia and 'came to nurture a brilliant and immensely diverse array of plants'.<ref>Karskens, Grace, ''The Colony, A History of Early Sydney'', Allen & Unwin, 2010 p23 ISBN 978 1 74237 364 5 </ref> It is, for example, the 'heartland of those most characteristic of Australian trees, the [[eucalyptus|eucalypts]]'<ref>Flannery, Tim 'The Sandstone City' in ''The Birth of Sydney'' 1999, p15. Flannery explains that plants cannot afford to lose leaves to herbivores when nutrients are scarce so they defend their foliage with toxins. In eucalypts, these toxins give the bush its distinctive smell.</ref>.

Sandstone escarpments box in the Sydney area on three sides - to the west the Blue Mountains, and to the north and south, the Hornsby and Woronora plateaux'.<ref>Karskens, Grace ''The Colony, A History of Early Sydney'' 2010 p19</ref> These escarpments, avoided by the early settlers, kept Sydney in its bounds and Sydneysiders still regard the boundaries of the city in these terms.

Other rock types found in Sydney include [[Narrabeen shale]] and the younger [[Wianamatta shale]] and [[Mittagong formation]].

== Hewing and working the stone==

Sydneysiders call the distinctive stone quarried and used in Sydney buildings 'Yellow block'. The sandstone [[Quarry|quarries]] 'Paradise', 'Purgatory' and 'Hellhole' were so named by the Scottish quarrymen who worked there in the 1850s. The names related to the degree of difficulty in working the stone and its quality. The best stone was 'Paradise', a soft rock that is easy to carve and weathers to a warm, golden straw colour.<ref name="Paradise, purgatory, hellhole names">{{cite web | url=http://www.powerhousemuseum.com/exhibitions/paradise.php | title="Paradise, Purgatory and Hellhole: a history of Pyrmont and Ultimo" | accessdate=2011-01-14 | author=Powerhouse Museum, Sydney | date=2006 | work=Exhibition: 19 March 2005 to 16 October 2006 | publisher=[[Powerhouse Museum]], Sydney}}</ref><ref>Irving, 2006.</ref> The 'Paradise quarry' was near present-day Jones and Saunders Streets, 'Purgatory' quarry was off Crown Road in [[Ultimo, New South Wales|Ultimo]],<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article13856664 |title=INQUESTS. |newspaper=[[Sydney_morning_herald|The Sydney Morning Herald (NSW: 1842-1954)]] |location=NSW |date=12 April 1892 |accessdate=13 January 2011 |page=3 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}</ref> near present-day Pyrmont Bridge Road, and 'Hellhole' was where Jones Street now is, near Fig Street. <ref name="Powerhouse map">{{cite web | url=http://www.powerhousemuseum.com/exhibitions/paradise_map.php | title=Map of Pyrmont and Ultimo | accessdate=2011-01-14 | author=[[Powerhouse Museum]], Sydney | date=2006 | publisher=Powerhouse Museum, Sydney}}</ref>

Stonecutters were subject to a range of lung diseases such as bronchitis, pneumonia and a disease known as "stonemasons' [[phthisis]]" which was suspected to be a form of [[tuberculosis]]. In 1908 questions  were asked in the Legislative Assembly in the parliament of New South Wales about how likely the men cutting sandstone in Sydney were to contracting the disease and whether the Government should grant medical aid to them.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article15014602 |title=STONEMASONS' PHTHISIS. |newspaper=[[Sydney_morning_herald|The Sydney Morning Herald (NSW : 1842-1954)]] |location=NSW |date=13 August 1908 |accessdate=14 January 2011 |page=4 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}</ref>

==Early building==
[[File:Argyle Cut.jpg|thumb|Argyle Cut]]

From the beginnings of the colony in 1788, settlers and convicts had to work with the stone, using it for building and trying to grow crops on the soil over it. The sandstone had a negative effect on farming because it underlay most of the available flat land at a very shallow depth. The early administrators sent groups of prisoners to an area nearby, named [[The Rocks, New South Wales|The Rocks]], to eke out what ever existence they could from the land and build housing for themselves. These first occupants hewed out sandstone from the outcrops and built simple houses. Convicts were also employed tunnelling through what is called the 'Argyle Cut' in The Rocks. The rock was dumped in the [[mangrove]] swamps at the head of the [[Tank Stream]] to begin to make [[Circular Quay]]. Later development in The Rocks area led to [[bond store]]s and [[warehouse]]s being built on the bay, with better housing and [[pub]]s for entertainment. Millions of cubic feet of sandstone was excavated from Sydney's [[Cockatoo Island]] to create a dry dock on the island.

As late as 1915 Sydney sandstone was being described as plentiful, easily worked and 'nearly everywhere employed by architects and builders'. <ref> 'In the early days ... Sydney sandstone was so plentiful and so easily worked that no one thought of going afield to explore for something better and even today freestone, as the sandstone is often called, is nearly everywhere employed by architects and builders.' ''The Sydney Morning Herald'' 6 April 1915 p4</ref>

==Nineteenth century architectural examples==

The main public buildings in Sydney, completed from the 1850s until the 1900s were built in sandstone from [[Pyrmont, New South Wales|Pyrmont]] where some 50 quarries operated. In 1909, for example, when an enquiry was undertaken about remodelling the [[Parliament House, Sydney|Parliamentary]] Buildings in [[Macquarie Street, Sydney|Macquarie Street]] it was reported that "the external work, excepting the southern flank, was to be carried out in Sydney sandstone and the main flight of steps in stone obtained from the Purgatory quarry". <ref> {{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article15028993 |title=PARLIAMENT HOUSE. |newspaper=[[Sydney_Morning_Herald|The Sydney Morning Herald (NSW: 1842-1954)]] |location=NSW |date=16 January 1909 |accessdate=13 January 2011 |page=11 |publisher=National Library of Australia}} </ref> 

From the 1870s, various building sites had up to 300 masons working and carving the stone. Historians have reported that during this period, there were more masons working in Sydney that the whole of Europe. 
Although many of Sydney's early sandstone buildings have been demolished, many remain.

==Changing attitudes==

By the middle of the twentieth century, when new 'modern' building materials had begun to be used, sandstone buildings were considered old-fashioned and many were demolished. Some gained a reprieve after much debate.  The Queen Victoria Building, for example, a grand and ornate building that occupies an entire Sydney block, was threatened with demolition and replacement by a car park.<ref>Shaw, 1987, p78</ref> A great debate among supporters and opponents of demolition followed. One architect, Elias Duek-Cohen, referred to its material in his defence of the building: 'It has a fine facade in warm-coloured stone ... forming a richly modelled surface'.<ref>Shaw, 1987 p86</ref> Demolition of sandstone buildings in [[The Rocks, New South Wales|The Rocks]] was forestalled in part because of a [[Green Ban]].
A revival began when the heritage value of these older buildings was recognised.

==Contemporary use and appreciation==
[[File:19th_century_Sydney_sandstone_wall.jpg|thumb|Weathered 19th century wall of Sydney sandstone]]
[[File:Contemporary_use_of_Sydney_sandstone.jpg|thumb|Contemporary wall of Sydney sandstone]]

Sydney sandstone is still being quarried, processed and supplied for building, landscaping, commercial and conservation work in Australia.<ref>For example, a commercial [http://www.gosfordquarries.com.au/ company] established in 1922, continues to supply Sydney sandstone.</ref> As a building material, sandstone has been used in major constructions and restorations such as Governor Phillip Tower and the Commemorative Museum, winning international architectural awards for excellence.

Architects, such as the award winner [[Robin Boyd Awards|Graham Jahn]], describe Sydney's sandstone buildings as 'wonderful'.<ref>'Initially we [students] were located in the old East Sydney Gaol complex where the National Art School is located. We were surrounded with big palm trees, student's plaster sculptures, and wonderful sandstone buildings.' http://www.architecture.com.au/i-cms?page=790</ref>

Sculptural uses of Sydney sandstone make aesthetic and symbolic use of the material's connection with Sydney's geology as well as its flora and fauna. For example, the [[Royal Botanic Gardens, Sydney]] commissioned sculptor [[Chris Booth]] to design a living sculpture for its grounds (scheduled to be finished by the end of 2010). One of the two main pieces of the sculpture is a 'sandstone wave', consisting of about 200 tonnes of sandstone blocks in an undulating form reminiscent of the tectonic forces that created the stone. The sculptor says the design is 'inspired by the sandstone stratas it emerges out of and, of course, the link to the sea which it cascades towards ... its evolution is from the geomorphology.'<ref>Mark Savio, 'A Living Sculpture' in ''The Gardens'', Issue 87 (Summer 2010/11) p26.
