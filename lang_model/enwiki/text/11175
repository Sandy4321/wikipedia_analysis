{{History of Scotland}}
'''Scotland in the Late Middle Ages''', between the deaths of [[Alexander III of Scotland|Alexander III]] in 1286 and [[James IV of Scotland|James IV]] in 1513, established its independence from England under figures including [[William Wallace]] in the late 13th century and [[Robert I of Scotland|Robert Bruce]] in the 14th century. In the 15th century under the [[Stewart Dynasty]], despite a turbulent political history, the Crown gained greater political control at the expense of independent lords and regained most of its lost territory to approximately the modern borders of the country. However, the [[Auld Alliance]] with France led to the heavy defeat of a Scottish army at the [[Battle of Flodden Field]] in 1513 and the death of the king [[James IV of Scotland|James IV]], which would be followed by a long minority and a period of political instability.

The economy of Scotland developed slowly in this period and a population of perhaps a little under a million by the middle of the 14th century began to decline after the arrival of the [[Black Death]], falling to perhaps half a million by the beginning of the 16th century. Different social systems and cultures developed in the lowland and highland regions of the country as [[Scots Gaelic|Gaelic]] remained the most common language north of the [[River Tay|Tay]] and [[Middle Scots]] dominated in the south, where it became the language of the ruling elite, government and a new national literature. There were significant changes in religion which saw [[mendicant]] friars and new devotions expand, particularly in the developing [[burgh]]s. 

By the end of the period Scotland had adopted many of the major tenets of the [[European Renaissance]] in art, architecture and literature and produced a developed educational system. This period has been seen one in which a clear national identity emerged in Scotland, as well as significant distinctions between different regions of the country which would be particularly significant in the period of the Reformation.

The death of king [[Alexander III of Scotland|Alexander III]] in 1286, and the subsequent death of his granddaughter and heir [[Margaret, Maid of Norway|Margaret]] (called "the Maid of Norway") in 1290, left 14 rivals for succession. To prevent civil war the Scottish magnates asked [[Edward I of England]] to arbitrate. He extracted legal recognition that the realm of Scotland was held as a feudal dependency to the throne of England before choosing [[John I of Scotland|John Balliol]], the man with the strongest claim, who became king as John I (30 November 1292).<ref>R. Mitchison, ''A History of Scotland'' (London: Routledge, 3rd edn., 2002), ISBN 0-415-27880-5, p. 40.</ref> Robert Bruce of Annandale, the next strongest claimant, accepted this outcome with reluctance. Over the next few years Edward I used the concessions he had gained to systematically undermine both the authority of King John and the independence of Scotland.<ref>R.

In 1296 Edward invaded Scotland, deposing King John. The following year [[William Wallace]] and [[Andrew de Moray|Andrew Murrey]] raised forces to resist the occupation and under their joint leadership an English army was defeated at the [[Battle of Stirling Bridge]]. Murrey died of wounds after the battle and for a short time Wallace ruled Scotland in the name of John Balliol as [[Guardian of Scotland|Guardian]] of the realm.<ref>A. D. M.

In 1320 the [[Declaration of Arbroath]], a remonstrance to the Pope from the nobles of Scotland, helped convince [[Pope John XXII]] to overturn the earlier excommunication and nullify the various acts of submission by Scottish kings to English ones so that Scotland's sovereignty could be recognised by the major European dynasties. The Declaration has also been seen as one of the most important documents in the development of a Scottish national identity.<ref>M.

Robert I died in 1329, leaving his five-year-old son to reign as [[David II of Scotland|David II]]; during his minority, the country was ruled by a series of governors. Two died as a result of a renewed invasion by English forces four years later on the pretext of restoring [[Edward Balliol]], son of John Balliol, to the Scottish throne, thus starting the Second War of Independence.<ref name=Keen2003>M.

After the unexpected death of the childless David II, Robert Stewart, the first of the Stewart (later Stuart) monarchs, came to the throne in 1371. Despite his relatively venerable age of 55, his son, [[Robert III of Scotland|John, Earl of Carrick]], grew impatient and assumed the reins of government as Lord Lieutenant. A border incursion into England led to the victory at [[Battle of Otterburn|Otterburn]] in 1388, but at the cost of the life of John's ally [[James Douglas, 2nd Earl of Douglas]]. This, along with Carrick having suffered a debilitating horse kick, led to a shift in power to his brother [[Robert Stewart, Duke of Albany|Robert Stewart, Earl of Fife]], who now was appointed as Lieutenant in his place. When Robert II died in 1390 John took the [[regnal name]] [[Robert III of Scotland|Robert III]], to avoid awkward questions over the exact status of the first King John, but power rested with his brother Robert, now Duke of Albany.<ref name=Rigby2003>S. H. Rigby, ''A Companion to Britain in the Later Middle Ages'' (Oxford: Wiley-Blackwell, 2003), ISBN 0-631-21785-1, pp. 301-2.</ref> After the suspicious death of his elder son, David, Duke of Rothesay in 1402, Robert, fearful for the safety of his younger son, James (the future [[James I of Scotland|James I]]), sent him to France in 1406. However, the English captured him en route and he spent the next 18 years as a prisoner held for ransom. As a result, after the death of Robert III later that year, regents ruled Scotland: first Albany and after his death in 1420 his son [[Murdoch Stewart, Duke of Albany|Murdoch]], during whose term of office the country suffered considerable unrest.<ref>A. D. M. Barrell, ''Medieval Scotland'' (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2000), ISBN 0-521-58602-X, pp. 151-4.</ref> 

When the Scots finally began the ransom payments in 1424, James, aged 32, returned with his English bride, [[Joan Beaufort, Queen of Scots|Joan Beaufort]], determined to assert this authority.<ref name=Rigby2003/> He revoked grants from customs and of lands made during his captivity, undermining the position of those who had gained in his absence, particularly the Albany Stewarts. James had Murdoch and two of his sons tried and then executed with further enforcement of his authority by more arrests and forfeiture of lands. In 1436 he attempted to regain one of the major border fortresses still in English hands at [[Roxburgh]], but the siege ended in a humiliating defeat. He was murdered by discontented council member Robert Graham and his co-conspirators near the [[Blackfriars, Perth|Blackfriars church, Perth]] in 1437.<ref>A. D. M.

====James II====
{{Main|James II of Scotland}}
[[File:James II of Scotland.jpg|thumb|upright|right|A later portrait of [[James II of Scotland|James II]], whose eventually military success was ended by his accidental death.]]	
The assassination left the king's seven-year-old son to reign as [[James II of Scotland|James II]]. After the execution of a number of suspected conspirators, leadership fell to [[Archibald Douglas, 5th Earl of Douglas]], as lieutenant-general of the realm. After his death in 1439, power was shared uneasily between the Douglas family, [[William Crichton, 1st Lord Crichton|William, 1st Lord Crichton]], [[List of Lord Chancellors of Scotland|Lord Chancellor of Scotland]] and Sir Alexander Livingston of Callendar. A conspiracy to break the power of the Douglas family led to the "Black Dinner" at [[Edinburgh Castle]] in 1440, which saw the judicial murder of the young [[William Douglas, 6th Earl of Douglas]] and his brother by Livingstone and Crichton. The main beneficiary was the victims' great uncle [[James Douglas, 7th Earl of Douglas|James Douglas, Earl of Avondale]] who became the 7th Earl of Douglas and emerged as the main power in the government.<ref name=Barrellp160-9>A. D. M. Barrell, ''Medieval Scotland'' (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2000), ISBN 0-521-58602-X, pp. 160-9.</ref><ref>A. Macquarrie, ''Medieval Scotland: Kinship and Nation'' (Thrupp: Sutton, 2004), p. 220.</ref>

In 1449 James II was declared to have reached his majority, but the Douglases consolidated their position and the king began a long struggle for power, leading to the murder of the 8th Earl of Douglas at Stirling Castle on 22 February 1452. This opened an intermittent civil war as James attempted to seize Douglas lands, punctuated by a series of humiliating reversals. Gradually James managed to win over the allies of the Douglases with offers of lands, titles and offices and the Douglases' forces were finally defeated at the [[Battle of Arkinholm]] on 12 May 1455.<ref name=Barrellp160-9/> Once independent, James II proved to be an active and interventionist king. He travelled the country dispensing justice and some of the unpopular policies of the following reign, such as the sale of pardons, may have originated in this period.<ref>R. Tanner, ''The Late Medieval Scottish Parliament: Politics and the Three Estates, 1424-1488'' (Edinburgh: Tuckwell, 2001), pp. 201-4.</ref> Ambitious plans to take Orkney, Shetland and the Isle of Man came to nothing. His attempt to take Roxburgh from the English in 1460 succeeded, but at the cost of his life as he was killed by an exploding artillery piece.<ref name=Barrellp160-9/>

====James III====
{{Main|James III of Scotland}}
[[File:James III of Scotland.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[James III of Scotland|James III]] whose faction riven reign ended in his murder.]]
James II's son, aged nine or ten, became king as [[James III of Scotland|James III]], and his widow [[Mary of Gueldres]] acted as regent until her own death three years later. The Boyd family, led by [[Robert Boyd, 1st Lord Boyd|Robert, Lord Boyd]], emerged as the leading force in the government, making themselves unpopular through self aggrandisement, with Lord Robert's son [[Thomas Boyd, 1st Earl of Arran|Thomas]] being made [[Earl of Arran]] and marrying the king's sister, [[Mary Stewart, Princess of Scotland|Mary]]. While Robert and Thomas were out of the country in 1469 the king asserted his control, executing members of the Boyd family.<ref>A. D. M. Barrell, ''Medieval Scotland'' (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2000), ISBN 0-521-58602-X, pp. 171-2.</ref> His foreign policy included a rapprochement with England, with his eldest son, the future [[James IV of Scotland|James IV]], being betrothed to [[Cecily of York]], the daughter of [[Edward IV of England]], a change of policy that was immensely unpopular at home.<ref name=Wormald1991p6>J. Wormald, ''Court, Kirk, and Community: Scotland, 1470-1625'' (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 1991), ISBN 0-7486-0276-3, p. 6.</ref>

During the 1470s conflict developed between the king and his brothers, [[Alexander Stewart, 1st Duke of Albany|Alexander, Duke of Albany]] and [[John Stewart, Earl of Mar (d. 1479)|John, Earl of Mar]]. Mar died suspiciously in 1480 and his estates were forfeited and possibly given to a royal [[favourite]], [[Robert Cochrane (architect)|Robert Cochrane]]. Albany fled to France in 1479, accused of [[treason]]. By this point the alliance with England was failing and from 1480 there was intermittent war, followed by a [[capture of Berwick (1482)|full-scale invasion]] of Scotland two years later, led by the Duke of Gloucester, the future [[Richard III of England|Richard III]], and accompanied by Albany. James was imprisoned by his own subjects in [[Edinburgh Castle]], and Albany was established as lieutenant-general. Having taken [[Berwick-upon-Tweed]] the English retreated and Albany's government began to collapse forcing him to flee. Despite conspiracies and more attempts at invasion, James was able to regain power. However, the king managed to alienate the barons, refusing to travel for the implementation of justice, preferring to be resident in Edinburgh, he debased the coinage, probably creating a financial crisis, he continued to pursue an English alliance and dismissed key supporters, including his Chancellor [[Colin Campbell, 1st Earl of Argyll]], becoming estranged from his wife, [[Margaret of Denmark, Queen of Scotland|Margaret of Denmark]], and his son James. Matters came to a head in 1488 when he faced an army raised by the disaffected nobles, and many former councillors, acting in the name of the prince as James IV. He was defeated at the [[Battle of Sauchieburn]] and killed.<ref>C. J.

He forcing through the forfeiture of the lands of the last lord [[John of Islay, Earl of Ross|John MacDonald]] in 1493, backing [[Alexander Gordon, 3rd Earl of Huntly]]'s power in the region and launching a series of naval campaigns and sieges that resulted in the capture or exile of his rivals by 1507.<ref>N. MacDougall, ''James IV: the Stewart Dynasty in Scotland'' (Edinbugh: John Donald, 1997), ISBN 0-85976-663-2, p. 189.</ref> 

For a time he supported [[Perkin Warbeck]], the pretender to the English throne, and carried out a brief invasion of England on his behalf in 1496. However, he then established good diplomatic relations with England, and in 1502 signed the [[Treaty of Perpetual Peace]], marrying [[Henry VII of England|Henry VII's]] daughter, [[Margaret Tudor]], thus laying the foundation for the 17th century [[Union of the Crowns]].<ref>R.

When the Pope organised a [[Holy League (1511)|Holy League]], which included England, against the French in 1511, James was caught between incompatible diplomatic policies. He tried to suggest an unrealistic European Crusade to Constantinople, but after border skirmishing, when the French were attacked by the English he declared war on England and was excommunicated by the Pope. He sent his navy and gunners to support the French and in 1513 led a major army of perhaps 34,000 over the border.<ref name=Wormald1991pp7>J.

The King, many of his nobles, and a large number of ordinary troops were killed, commemorated by the song "[[Flowers of the Forest|The Floo'ers o' the Forest]]".

==Geography==
{{Main|Geography of Scotland}}
[[File:Scotland (Location) Named (HR).png|left|upright|thumb|The topography of Scotland.]]
The defining factor in the geography of Scotland is the distinction between the [[Highlands and Islands]] in the north and west and the [[Scottish lowlands|lowlands]] in the south and east. The highlands are further divided into the [[Northwest Highlands]] and the [[Grampian Mountains]] by the fault line of the [[Great Glen]]. The lowlands are divided into the fertile belt of the [[Central Lowlands]] and the higher terrain of the [[Southern Uplands]], which included the [[Cheviot hills]], over which the border with England came to run by the end of the period.<ref>R. Mitchison, ''A History of Scotland'' (London: Routledge, 3rd edn., 2002), ISBN 0-415-27880-5, p. 2.</ref> The Central Lowland belt averages about 50 miles in width<ref>''World and Its Peoples'' (London: Marshall Cavendish), ISBN 0-7614-7883-3, p. 13.</ref> and, because it contains most of the good quality agricultural land and has easier communications, could support most of the urbanisation and elements of conventional medieval government.<ref name=Wormald1991pp39-40/> However, the Southern Uplands, and particularly the Highlands were economically less productive and much more difficult to govern. This provided Scotland with a form of protection, as minor English incursions had to cross the difficult southern uplands<ref>A. G. Ogilvie, ''Great Britain: Essays in Regional Geography'' (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1952), p. 421.</ref> and the two major attempts at conquest by the English, under Edward I and then Edward III, were unable to penetrate the highlands, from which area potential resistance could reconquer the lowlands.<ref>R. R. Sellmen, ''Medieval English Warfare'' (London: Taylor & Francis, 1964), p. 29.</ref> However, it also made those areas problematic to govern for Scottish kings and much of the political history of the era after the wars of independence circulated around attempts to resolve problems of entrenched localism in these regions.<ref name=Wormald1991pp39-40>J.

It was in the later medieval era that the borders of Scotland reached approximately their modern extent. The [[Isle of Man]] fell under English control in the 14th century, despite several attempts to restore Scottish authority.<ref>A. Grant, K. J. Stringer, eds, ''Uniting the Kingdom?: the Making of British History'' (London: Routledge, 1995), ISBN 0-415-13041-7, p. 101.</ref> The English were able to annex a large slice of the lowlands under Edward III, but these losses were gradually regained, particularly while England was preoccupied with the [[Wars of the Roses]] (1455<U+2013>85).<ref name=Bawcutt&Williams2006p21>P.

==Demography==
{{Main|Demography of Scotland}}
Because medieval Scotland lacked the intrusive government and growing bureaucracy that can be found in contemporaneous England, there is very little evidence on which to base reliable estimates of population before the early 18th century. On the basis that it had roughly a sixth of the farmable land of England, it has been suggested that the population would have been of a similar proportion, probably a little less than a million at its height before the [[Black Death]] reached the country in 1349. Although there is no reliable documentation on the impact of the plague, there are many anecdotal references to abandoned land in the following decades. If the pattern followed that in England, then the population may have fallen to as low as half a million by the end of the 15th century.<ref name=Rigby2003p109-11>S. H.

It has been suggested that they would have had a mean population of about 2,000, but many would be much smaller than 1,000 and the largest, Edinburgh, probably had a population of over 10,000 by the end of the era.<ref name=Gemmill&Mayhew1995pp8-10/>

==Economy==

[[File:14thC Scottish Economy.jpg|thumb|right|upright|The economy of Scotland in the 14th century.]]

===Agriculture===
Scotland is roughly half the size of England and Wales, but has only between a fifth and a sixth of the amount of the arable or good pastoral land, making marginal pastoral farming and, with its extensive coastline, fishing, the key factors in the medieval economy.<ref name=Gemmill&Mayhew1995pp8-10>E. Gemmill and N. J. Mayhew, ''Changing Values in Medieval Scotland: a Study of Prices, Money, and Weights and Measures'' (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1995), ISBN 0-521-47385-3, pp. 8-10.</ref> With difficult terrain, poor roads and methods of transport there was little trade between different areas of the country and most settlements depended on what was produced locally, often with very little in reserve in bad years. Most farming was based on the lowland farmtoun or highland [[Township (Scotland)|baile]], settlements of a handful of families that jointly farmed an area notionally suitable for two or three plough teams, allocated in [[run rig]]s to tenant farmers. They usually ran downhill so that they included both wet and dry land, helping to offset some of the problems of extreme weather conditions.<ref name=Wormald1991pp41-55/> This land was divided into the infield, which was in continuous arable cultivation, and the outfield which was rotated between arable and grass.<ref>M. L. Parry, T. R. Slater, ''The Making of the Scottish Countryside'' (London: Taylor & Francis, 1980), ISBN 0-85664-646-6, pp. 86-9.</ref>  Most ploughing was done with a heavy wooden plough with an iron [[coulter (agriculture)|coulter]], pulled by oxen, who were more effective and cheaper to feed than horses. Obligations to the local lord usually included supplying oxen for ploughing the lord's land on an annual basis and the much resented obligation to grind corn at the lord's mill.<ref name=Wormald1991pp41-55>J. Wormald, ''Court, Kirk, and Community: Scotland, 1470-1625'' (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 1991), ISBN 0-7486-0276-3, pp. 41-55.</ref> The rural economy appears to have boomed in the 13th century and in the immediate aftermath of the Black Death was still buoyant, but by the 1360s there was a severe falling off of incomes, which can be seen in clerical benefices, of between a third and half compared with the beginning of the era. This was followed by a slow recovery in the 15th century.<ref name=Rigby2003pp111-16>S. H. Rigby, ed., ''A Companion to Britain in the Later Middle Ages'' (Oxford: Wiley-Blackwell, 2003), ISBN 0-631-21785-1, pp. 111-6.</ref>

===Burghs===
{{Main|Burgh}}
[[File:Provand's Lordship Castle Street Glasgow - geograph.org.uk - 1517876.jpg|thumb|left|Provand's Lordship, Glasgow, the only house to survive from the medieval burgh of Glasgow.]]
Most of the burghs were on the east coast, and among them were the largest and wealthiest, including Aberdeen, Perth and Edinburgh, whose growth was facilitated by trade with the continent. Although in the southwest [[Glasgow]] was beginning to develop and [[Ayr]] and [[Kirkcudbright]] had occasional links with Spain and France, sea trade with Ireland was much less profitable. In addition to the major [[royal burgh]]s this era saw the proliferation of lesser [[Burgh of barony|baronial]] and ecclesiastical burghs, with 51 being created between 1450 and 1516. Most of these were much smaller than their royal counterparts; excluded from international trade, they mainly acted as local markets and centres of craftsmanship.<ref>R. Mitchison, ''A History of Scotland'' (London: Routledge, 3rd edn., 2002), ISBN 0-415-27880-5, p. 78.</ref> In general burghs probably carried out far more local trading with their hinterlands, relying on them for food and raw materials. The wool trade was a major export at the beginning of the period, but the introduction of [[mange|sheep-scab]] was a serious blow to the trade and it began to decline as an export from the early 15th century and despite a levelling off, there was another drop in exports as the markets collapsed in the early-16th century Low Countries. Unlike in England, this did not prompt the Scots to turn to large scale cloth production and only poor quality rough cloths seem to have been significant.<ref name=Wormald1991pp41-55/>

===Crafts and industry===
There were relatively few developed crafts in Scotland in this period, although by the later 15th century there were the beginnings of a native iron casting industry, which led to the production of cannon, and of the [[silversmith|silver]] and [[goldsmith]]ing for which the country would later be known. As a result the most important exports were unprocessed raw materials, including wool, hides, salt, fish, animals and coal, while Scotland remained frequently short of wood, iron and, in years of bad harvests, grain.<ref name=Wormald1991pp41-55/> Exports of hides and particularly salmon, where the Scots held a decisive advantage in quality over their rivals, appear to have held up much better than wool, despite the general economic downturn in Europe in the aftermath of the plague.<ref name=Rigby2003pp111-16/> The growing desire among the court, lords, upper clergy and wealthier merchants for luxury goods that largely had to be imported led to a chronic shortage of [[bullion]]. This, and perennial problems in royal finance, led to several debasements of the coinage, with the amount of silver in a penny being cut to almost a fifth between the late 14th century and the late 15th century. The heavily debased "black money" introduced in 1480 had to be withdrawn two years later and may have helped fuel a financial and political crisis.<ref name=Wormald1991pp41-55/>

==Society==
{{Main|Scottish society in the Middle Ages}}
[[File:Scottish clan map.png|thumb|right|upright|Map showing highland clans and lowland surnames.]]

===Kinship and clans===
{{Main|Scottish surnames|Scottish clans}}
The fundamental social bond in late medieval Scottish society was that of kinship. Descent was [[agnatic]], with members of a group sharing a (sometimes fictional) common ancestor, in the south often reflected in a common surname. Unlike in England, where kinship was predominately [[cognatic]] (derived through both males and females), women retained their original surname at marriage and marriages were intended to create friendship between kin groups, rather than a new bond of kinship.<ref name=Wormald1991pp29-35>J. Wormald, ''Court, Kirk, and Community: Scotland, 1470-1625'' (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 1991), ISBN 0-7486-0276-3, pp. 29-35.</ref> As a result, a shared surname has been seen as a "test of kinship", proving large bodies of kin who could call on each other<U+2019>s support and this could help intensify the idea of the feud, which was usually carried out as a form of revenge for a kinsman and for which a large bodies of kin could be counted on to support rival sides, although conflict between members of kin groups also occurred.<ref>J. W. Armstrong, "The 'fyre of ire Kyndild' in the fifteenth-century Scottish Marches", in S. A. Throop and P. R. Hyams, eds, ''Vengeance in the Middle Ages: Emotion, Religion and Feud'' (Aldershot: Ashgate, 2010), ISBN 0-7546-6421-X, p. 71.</ref>  

The combination of agnatic kinship and a feudal system of obligation has been seen as creating the highland [[clan]] system, evident in records from the 13th century.<ref>G. W. S. Barrow, ''Robert Bruce'' (Berkley CA.: University of California Press, 1965), p. 7.</ref> Surnames were rare in the highlands until the 17th and 18th centuries and in the Middle Ages all members of a clan did not share a name and most ordinary members were usually not related to its head.<ref>J. P. Campbell, ''Popular Culture in the Middle Ages'' (Madison, WI: Popular Press, 1986), ISBN 0-87972-339-4, p. 98, n.</ref> The head of a clan in the beginning of the era was often the strongest male in the main [[sept]] or branch of the clan, but later, as [[primogeniture]] began to dominate, was usually the eldest son of the last chief.<ref name=Roberts2000p13>J. L. Roberts, ''Clan, King, and Covenant: History of the Highland Clans from the Civil War to the Glencoe Massacre'' (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 2000), ISBN 0-7486-1393-5, p. 13.</ref> The leading families of a clan formed the ''fine'', often seen as equivalent to lowland gentlemen, providing council in peace and leadership in war,<ref>M. J. Green, ''The Celtic World'' (London: Routledge, 1996), ISBN 0-415-14627-5, p. 667.</ref> and below them were the ''daoine usisle'' (in Gaelic) or [[tacksmen]] (in Scots), who managed the clan lands and collected the rents.<ref>D. Moody, ''Scottish Family History'' (Genealogical Publishing Com, 1994), ISBN 0-8063-1268-8, pp. 99-104.</ref> In the isles and along the adjacent western seaboard there were also ''buannachann'', who acted as a military elite, defending the clan lands from raids or taking part in attacks on clan enemies. Most of the followers of the clan were tenants, who supplied labour to the clan heads and sometimes act as soldiers. In the early modern era they would take the clan name as their surname, turning the clan into a massive, if often fictive, kin group.<ref name=Roberts2000p13/>

===Social structure===
[[File:LateMedievalScotsRanks.jpg|thumb|300px|left|A table of ranks in late Medieval Scottish society.]]
In the late medieval era the terminology used to describe the different ranks of Scottish social structure was increasingly dominated by the Scots language and as a result began to parallel the terminology used in England. This consciousness over status was reflected in military and (from 1430) [[sumptuary]] legislation, which set out the types of weapons and armour that should be maintained, and clothes that could be worn, by various ranks.<ref name=Wormald1991pp29-35/> Below the king were a small number of [[duke]]s (usually descended from very close relatives of the king) and [[List of earls#Earls of Scotland|earl]]s, who formed the senior nobility. Below them were the barons, and, from the 1440s, fulfilling the same role were the [[lords of Parliament]], the lowest level of the nobility with the rank-given right to attend the Estates. There were perhaps 40 to 60 of these in Scotland throughout the period.<ref name=Grant2000>A. Grant, "Service and tenure in late medieval Scotland 1324-1475" in A. Curry and E. Matthew, eds, ''Concepts and Patterns of Service in the Later Middle Ages'' (Woodbridge: Boydell, 2000), ISBN 0-85115-814-5, pp. 145-65.</ref> Members of these noble ranks, perhaps particularly those that had performed military or administrative service to the Crown, might also be eligible for the status of knighthood.<ref>K. Stevenson, ''Chivalry and Knighthood in Scotland, 1424-1513'' (Woodbridge: Boydell, 2006), ISBN 1-84383-192-9, pp. 13-15.</ref> Below these were the [[laird]]s, roughly equivalent to the English [[gentlemen]].<ref name=Grant2000/> Most were in some sense in the service of the major nobility, either in terms of land or military obligations,<ref name=Grant2000/> roughly half sharing with them their name and a distant and often uncertain form of kinship.<ref name=Goodacre1999pp57-60>J. Goodacre, ''State and Society in Early Modern Scotland'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1999), ISBN 0-19-820762-X, pp. 57-60.</ref> Serfdom died out in Scotland in the 14th century, although through the system of [[Court baron|courts baron]] landlords still exerted considerable control over their tenants.<ref name=Goodacre1999pp57-60/> Below the lords and lairds were a variety of groups, often ill-defined. These included [[yeomen]], sometimes called "bonnet lairds", often owning substantial land, and below them the [[husbandmen]], lesser landholders and free tenants that made up the majority of the working population.<ref>A. Grant, "Late medieval foundations", in A. Grant and K. J. Stringer, eds, ''Uniting the Kingdom?: the Making of British History'' (London: Routledge, 1995), ISBN 0-415-13041-7, p. 99.</ref> Society in the burghs was headed by wealthier merchants, who often held local office as a [[burgess (title)|burgess]], [[alderman]], [[bailie]]s or as a member of the council. A small number of these successful merchants were dubbed knights for their service by the king by the end of the era, although this seems to have been an exceptional form of civic knighthood that did not put them on a par with landed knights.<ref>K. Stevenson, "Thai war callit knynchtis and bere the name and the honour of that hye ordre: Scottish knighthood in the fifteenth century", in L. Clark, ed., ''Identity and Insurgency in the Late Middle Ages'' (Woodbridge: Boydell, 2006), ISBN 1-84383-270-4, p. 38.</ref> Below them were [[craftsmen]] and workers that made up the majority of the urban population.<ref name=Wormald1991pp48-9>J. Wormald, ''Court, Kirk, and Community: Scotland, 1470-1625'' (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 1991), ISBN 0-7486-0276-3, pp. 48-9.</ref>

===Social conflict===
Historians have noted considerable political conflict in the burghs between the great merchants and craftsmen throughout the period. Merchants attempted to prevent lower crafts and [[guild|gild]]s from infringing on their trade, monopolies and political power. Craftsmen attempted to emphasise their importance and to break into disputed areas of economic activity, setting prices and standards of workmanship. In the 15th century a series of statutes cemented the political position of the merchants, with limitations on the ability of residents to influence the composition of burgh councils and many of the functions of regulation taken on by the bailies.<ref name=Wormald1991pp48-9/> In rural society historians have noted a lack of evidence of widespread unrest similar to that evidenced the [[Jacquerie]] of 1358 in France and the [[Peasants' Revolt]] of 1381 in England, possibly because there was relatively little of the type of change in agriculture, like the [[enclosure]] of common land, that could create widespread resentment before the modern era. Instead a major factor was the willingness of tenants to support their betters in any conflict in which they were involved, for which landlords reciprocated with charity and support.<ref name=Wormald1991pp50-1>J. Wormald, ''Court, Kirk, and Community: Scotland, 1470-1625'' (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 1991), ISBN 0-7486-0276-3, pp. 50-1.</ref> Highland and border society acquired a reputation for lawless activity, particularly the [[feud]]. However, more recent interpretations have pointed to the feud as a means of preventing and speedily resolving disputes by forcing arbitration, compensation and resolution.<ref name=Wormald1991pp28&35-9>J. Wormald, ''Court, Kirk, and Community: Scotland, 1470-1625'' (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 1991), ISBN 0-7486-0276-3, pp. 28 and 35-9.</ref>

==Government==
{{Main|Government in Medieval Scotland}}
[[File:Robert II (Alba) i.JPG|thumb|right|An engraving of [[Robert II of Scotland|Robert II]] depicted enthroned as a lawgiver on his great seal.]]

===The Crown===
The Crown was at the centre of government in late medieval Scotland. The unification of the kingdom, the spread of Anglo-Norman custom, the development of a European trading economy and Robert I's success in achieving independence from England, all did much to build up the prestige of the institution.<ref>N. H. Reid, "Crown and Community under Robert I", in G. W. S. Barrow, A. Grant and K. J. Stringer, eds, ''Medieval Scotland: Crown, Lordship and Community'' (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 1998), ISBN 0-7486-1110-X, p. 221.</ref> However, its authority within the kingdom was not unchallenged, not least from the many semi-independent lordships and it endured a series of crisis, particularly frequent minorities and resulting regencies. All of this, in addition to the relative poverty of the kingdom and the lack of a system of regular taxation, helped to limit the scale of central administration and government.<ref name="Wormald1991pp14-5"/> Much more than the English monarchy, the Scottish court remained a largely itinerant institution, with the king moving between royal castles, particularly Perth and Stirling, but also holding judicial sessions throughout the kingdom, with Edinburgh only beginning to emerge as the capital in the reign of James III at the cost of considerable unpopularity.<ref name="Wormald1991pp14-5">J. Wormald, ''Court, Kirk, and Community: Scotland, 1470<U+2013>1625'' (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 1991), ISBN 0-7486-0276-3, pp. 14-15.</ref> Like most western European monarchies, the Scottish Crown in the 15th century adopted the example of the [[Duchy of Burgundy|Burgundian court]], through formality and elegance putting itself at the centre of culture and political life, defined with display, ritual and pageantry, reflected in elaborate new palaces and patronage of the arts.<ref name="Wormald1991p18">J. Wormald, ''Court, Kirk, and Community: Scotland, 1470<U+2013>1625'' (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 1991), ISBN 0-7486-0276-3, p. 18.</ref>

===Privy Council===
{{Main|Privy Council of Scotland}}
After the Crown the most important government institution was the Privy Council, composed of the king's closest advisers, but which, unlike in England, retained legislative and judicial powers. It was relatively small, with normally less than 10 members in a meeting, some of whom were nominated by Parliament, particularly during the many minorities of the era, as a means of limiting the power of a regent.<ref name="Wormald1991pp22-3">J. Wormald, ''Court, Kirk, and Community: Scotland, 1470<U+2013>1625'' (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 1991), ISBN 0-7486-0276-3, p. 22.</ref> The council was a virtually full-time institution by the late 15th century, and surviving records from the period indicate it was critical in the working of royal justice. Nominally members of the council were some of the great magnates of the realm, but they rarely attended meetings. Most of the active members of the council for most of the period were career administrators and lawyers, almost exclusively university-educated clergy, the most successful of which moved on to occupy the major ecclesiastical positions in the realm as bishops and, towards the end of the period, archbishops. By the end of the 15th century this group was being joined by increasing numbers of literate laymen, often secular lawyers, of which the most successful gained preferment in the judicial system and grants of lands and lordships. From the reign of James III onwards the clerically-dominated post of [[Lord Chancellor of Scotland|Lord Chancellor]] was increasingly taken by leading laymen.<ref name="Wormald1991pp22-3"/>

===Parliament===
{{Main|Parliament of Scotland}}
[[File:The Old Tolbooth.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Old Tolbooth, Edinburgh]], location of Scottish Parliaments from the mid-15th century to the mid 17th century.]]
The next most important body in the process of government was parliament, which had evolved by the late 13th century from the King's Council of Bishops and Earls into a <U+2018>colloquium<U+2019> with a political and judicial role.<ref>K. M. Brown and R. J. Tanner, ''The History of the Scottish Parliament volume 1: Parliament and Politics, 1235-1560'' (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 2004), pp. 1-28.</ref> By the early 14th century, the attendance of [[knight]]s and [[Fee simple|freeholders]] had become important, and probably from 1326 [[burgh]] commissioners joined them to form the [[Three Estates]], meeting in a variety of major towns throughout the kingdom.<ref>Alan R. MacDonald, ''The Burghs and Parliament in Scotland, c. 1550-1651'' (Aldershot: Ashgate, 2007), ISBN 0-7546-5328-5, p. 14.</ref><ref>K. M. Brown, ''Parliament and Politics in Scotland, 1235-1560'' (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 2004), ISBN 0-7486-1485-0, p. 50.</ref> It acquired significant powers over particular issues, including consent for taxation, but it also had a strong influence over justice, foreign policy, war, and other legislation, whether political, [[ecclesiastical]], social or economic. From the early 1450s, a great deal of the legislative business of the Scottish Parliament was usually carried out by a parliamentary committee known as the <U+2018>Lords of the Articles<U+2019>, chosen by the three estates to draft legislation which was then presented to the full assembly to be confirmed.<ref>R. J. Tanner, 'The Lords of the Articles before 1540', in ''Scottish Historical Review'', 79, (2000), pp. 189-212.</ref> Parliamentary business was also carried out by <U+2018>sister<U+2019> institutions, before c. 1500 by [[General Council of Scotland|General Council]] and thereafter by the [[Convention of Estates of Scotland|Convention of Estates]]. These could carry out much business also dealt with by Parliament<U+2014>taxation, legislation and policy-making<U+2014>but lacked the ultimate authority of a full parliament.<ref>R. J. Tanner, ''The Late Medieval Scottish Parliament: Politics and the Three Estates, 1424-1488'' (Edinburgh: Tuckwell, 2001), ISBN 1-86232-174-4.</ref>  In the 15th century parliament was being called on an almost annual basis, more often than its English counterpart, and was willing to offer occasional resistance or criticism to the policies of the Crown, particular in the unpopular reign of James III.<ref name="Wormald1991p18" /> However, from about 1494, after his success against the Stewarts and Douglases and over rebels in 1482 and 1488, James IV managed to largely dispense with the institution and it might have declined, like many other systems of Estates in continental Europe, had it not been for his death in 1513 and another long minority.<ref name="Wormald1991p21">J.

===Local government===
{{Main|History of local government in Scotland}}
At a local level, government combined traditional kinship-based lordships with a relatively small system of royal offices. Until the 15th century the ancient pattern of major lordships survived largely intact, with the addition of two new "scattered earldoms" of [[Clan Douglas|Douglas]] and [[Clan Crawford|Crawford]], thanks to royal patronage after the Wars of Independence, mainly in the borders and south-west. The dominant kindred were the Stewarts, who came to control many of the earldoms. Their acquisition of the Crown, and a series of internal conflicts and confiscations, meant that by around 1460s the monarchy had transformed its position within the realm, gaining control of most of the "provincial" earldoms and lordships. Rather than running semi-independent lordships, the major magnates now had scattered estates and occasional regions of major influence. In the lowlands the Crown was now able to administer government through a system of sheriffdoms and other appointed officers, rather than semi-independent lordships. In the highlands James II created two new provincial earldoms for his favourites: Argyll for the [[Clan Campbell|Campbells]] and Huntly for the [[Clan Gordon|Gordons]], which acted as a bulwark against the vast [[Lord of the Isles|Lordship of the Isles]] built up by the [[Clan Donald|Macdonalds]]. James IV largely resolved the Macdonald problem by annexing the estates and titles of [[John Macdonald II]] to the Crown in 1493 after discovering his plans for an alliance with the English.<ref>A.

Scottish armies of the late medieval era depended on a combination of familial, communal and [[feudal]] forms of service. "Scottish service" (''servitum Scoticanum''), also known as "common service" (''communis exertcitus''), a levy of all able-bodied freemen aged between 16 and 60, provided the bulk of armed forces, with (according to decrees) 8 days warning. Feudal obligations, by which knights held castles and estates in exchange for service, provided troops on a 40 day basis. By the second half of the 14th century money contracts of ''bonds'' or ''bands of [[manrent]]'', similar to English [[indentures]] of the same period, were being used to retain more professional troops, particularly [[men-at-arms]] and [[archery|archers]].<ref name=Brown2004>M. Brown, ''The Wars of Scotland, 1214-1371'' (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 2004), ISBN 0-7486-1238-6, p. 58.</ref> In practice forms of service tended to blur and overlap and several major Scottish lords brought contingents from their kindred.<ref name=Brown2004/> 

These systems produced relatively large numbers of poorly armoured infantry, often armed with 12<U+2013>14 foot spears. They often formed the large close order defensive formations of [[shiltron]]s, able to counter mounted knights as they did at Bannockburn, but vulnerable to arrows (and later [[artillery]] fire) and relatively immobile, as they proved at Halidon Hill.<ref>D. M. Barrell, ''Medieval Scotland'' (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2000), ISBN 0-521-58602-X, p. 108.</ref> There were attempts to replace spears with longer pikes of 15<U+00BD> to 18<U+00BD> feet in the later 15th century, in emulation of successes over mounted troops in the Netherlands and Switzerland, but this does not appear to have been successful until the eve of the Flodden campaign in early 16th century.<ref>J. Cooper, ''Scottish Renaissance Armies 1513-1550'' (London: Osprey Publishing, 2008), ISBN 1-84603-325-X, p. 23.</ref> There were smaller numbers of archers and men-at-arms, which were often outnumbered when facing the English on the battlefield. Archers became much sought after as mercenaries in French armies of the 15th century in order to help counter the English superiority in this arm, becoming a major element of the French royal guards as the [[Garde <U+00C9>cossaise]].<ref>P. Contamine, "Scottish soldiers in France in the second half of the 15th century: mercenaries, immigrants, or Frenchmen in the making?" in G. G. Simpson, ed., ''The Scottish Soldier Abroad, 1247-1967'' (Edinburgh: Rowman & Littlefield, 1992), ISBN 0-85976-341-2, pp. 16-30.</ref> Scottish men-at-arms often dismounted to fight beside the infantry, with perhaps a small mounted reserve, and it has been suggested that these tactics were copied and refined by the English, leading to their successes in the Hundred Years War.<ref>H.-Henning Kort<U+00FC>m, ''Transcultural Wars from the Middle Ages to the 21st Century'' (Berlin: Akademie Verlag, 2006), ISBN 3-05-004131-5, p. 51.</ref>

===Artillery===

The Stewarts attempted to follow France and England in building up an artillery train. The abortive siege of Roxborugh in 1436 under James I was probably the first conflict in which the Scots made serious use of artillery.<ref>D. H. Caldwell, "The Scots and guns", in A. King and M. A.

After the establishment of Scottish independence, Robert I turned his attention to building up a Scottish naval capacity. This was largely focused on the west coast, with the Exchequer Rolls of 1326 recording the feudal duties of his vassals in that region to aid him with their vessels and crews. Towards the end of his reign he supervised the building of at least one royal man-of-war near his palace at [[Cardross, Argyll and Bute|Cardross]] on the [[River Clyde]]. In the late 14th century naval warfare with England was conducted largely by hired Scots, Flemish and French merchantmen and privateers.<ref name=Grant>J. Grant, "The Old Scots Navy from 1689 to 1710", ''Publications of the Navy Records Society'', 44 (London: Navy Records Society, 1913-4), pp. i-xii.</ref> James I took a greater interest in naval power. After his return to Scotland in 1424 he established a shipbuilding yard at [[Leith]], a house for marine stores, and a workshop. King's ships, one of which accompanied him on his expedition to the Islands in 1429, were built and equipped there to be used for trade as well as war, and the office of [[Lord High Admiral of Scotland|Lord High Admiral]] was probably founded in this period. In his struggles with his nobles in 1488 James III received assistance from his two warships the ''Flower'' and the ''King's Carvel'' also known as the ''Yellow Carvel''.<ref name=Grant/>

James IV put the enterprise on a new footing, founding a new harbour at [[Newhaven, Edinburgh|Newhaven]] in May 1504, and two years later ordered the construction of a dockyard at the Pools of [[Airth]]. The upper reaches of the Forth were protected by new fortifications on [[Inchgarvie]].<ref>N.

Since gaining its independence from English ecclesiastical organisation in 1192, the Catholic Church in Scotland had been a "special daughter of the see of Rome", enjoying a direct relationship with the [[Papacy]].<ref name=Bawcutt&Williams2006pp26-9>P.

This led to the placement of clients and relatives of the king in key positions, including James IV's illegitimate son [[Alexander Stewart (Archbishop of St Andrews)|Alexander]], who was nominated as Archbishop of St. Andrews at the age of 11, intensifying royal influence and also opening the Church to accusations of [[venal]]ity and [[nepotism]].<ref name="Wormald1991pp75-87"/> Despite this, relationships between the Scottish crown and the Papacy were generally good, with James IV receiving tokens of papal favour.<ref name=Bawcutt&Williams2006pp26-9/>

[[File:Tower of St. Salvator's College, St. Andrews Fife.jpg|thumb|right|160px|Tower of St. Salvator's College, University of St. Andrews.]]
In medieval Scotland education was dominated by the [[Roman Catholic|Church]] and largely aimed at the training and education of clerics. In the later medieval period there was a general increase in the numbers of educational institutions as well as increasing use by the laity. These included private tuition in the families of lords and wealthy burghers, song schools attached to most major churches and an increasing number of grammar schools, particularly in the expanding burghs. These were almost exclusively aimed at boys, but by the end of the 15th century Edinburgh also had schools for girls.<ref name=Bawcutt&Williams2006pp29-30/> The growing emphasis on education cumulated with the passing of the [[Education Act 1496]], which decreed that all sons of barons and freeholders of substance should attend grammar schools. All this resulted in an increase in literacy, but which was largely concentrated among a male and wealthy elite,<ref name=Bawcutt&Williams2006pp29-30>P. J. Bawcutt and J. H. Williams, ''A Companion to Medieval Scottish Poetry'' (Woodbridge: Brewer, 2006), ISBN 1-84384-096-0, pp. 29-30.</ref> with perhaps 60 per cent of the nobility being literate by the end of the period.<ref name=Wormald1991pp68-72>J.

Until the 15th century those who wished to attend university had to travel to England or the continent, but this situation was transformed by the founding of the [[University of St Andrews]] in 1413, the [[University of Glasgow]] in 1450 and the [[University of Aberdeen]] in 1495.<ref name=Bawcutt&Williams2006pp29-30/> Initially these institutions were designed for the training of clerics, but they would increasingly be used by laymen who would begin to challenge the clerical monopoly of administrative post in the government and law. Scottish scholars continued to visit the continent for their second degrees and this international contact helped bring the new ideas of [[humanism]] back into Scottish intellectual life.<ref name=Wormald1991pp68-72/>

Scotland is known for its dramatically placed castles, many of which date from the late medieval era. In contrast to England, where the wealthy began to move towards more comfortable grand houses, these continued to be built into the modern period, developing into the style of [[Scottish Baronial]] architecture in the 19th century, popular amongst the minor aristocracy and merchant class.<ref name=britbbc>{{citation|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/british/architecture_01.shtml|publisher=bbc.co.uk|date=2009-11-05|accessdate=2010-01-13|title=A History of British Architecture|first=Adrian|last=Tinniswood}}</ref> This building type, often built with defence in mind in the form of the [[tower house]], was characterised by [[corbel]]led turrets and crow-stepped [[gable]]s marked the first uniquely Scottish mode of building.<ref>I.

Parish church architecture in Scotland was often much less elaborate than in England, with many churches remaining simple oblongs, without [[transept]]s and [[aisle]]s, and often without towers. In the highlands they were often even simpler, many built of rubble masonry and sometimes indistinguishable from the outside from houses or farm buildings.<ref name=Whyte&Whyte1991p117>I. D.

[[File:Book of Dean of Lismore page.jpg|thumb|right|Two facsimiles from ''[[Book of the Dean of Lismore]]'', printed by [[William Forbes Skene]] in 1862.]]
In was in this period that the Scots language became the dominant language of the state and the social elite, while also becoming linked with Scottish national identity and making inroads into the highland zone at the expense of [[Scottish Gaelic|Gaelic]]. [[Middle Scots]], often called "English" in this period, was derived largely from [[Old English]], with the addition of elements from Gaelic and [[French language|French]]. Although resembling the language spoken in northern England, it became a distinct dialect from the late 14th century onwards.<ref name="Wormald1991pp60-7">J. Wormald, ''Court, Kirk, and Community: Scotland, 1470-1625'' (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 1991), ISBN 0-7486-0276-3, pp. 60-7.</ref> It was the dominant language of the lowlands and borders, brought there largely by Anglo-Saxon settlers from the 5th century, but began to be adopted by the ruling elite as they gradually abandoned French in the late medieval era. By the 15th century it was the language of government, with acts of parliament, council records and treasurer's accounts almost all using it from the reign of James I onwards. As a result Gaelic, once dominant north of the Tay, began a steady decline.<ref name="Wormald1991pp60-7"/> 

Gaelic was the language of the [[bardic tradition]], which provided a mechanism for the transference of oral culture from generation to generation. Members of bardic schools were trained in the complex rules and forms of Gaelic poetry. In a non-literate society they were the repositories of knowledge, including not just stories and songs, but also genealogies and medicine. They were found in many of the courts of the great lords, down to the chiefdoms of the highlands at the beginning of the period. The bardic tradition was not completely isolated from trends elsewhere, including love poetry influenced by continental developments and medical manuscripts from Padua, Salerno and Montpellier translated from Latin. The Gaelic oral tradition also began to manifest itself in written form, with the great compilation of Gaelic poetry, the ''[[Book of the Dean of Lismore]]'' produced by James and Duncan MacGregor at the beginning of the 16th century, probably designed for use in the courts of the greater chiefs. However, by the 15th century lowland writers were beginning to treat Gaelic as a second class, rustic and even amusing language, helping to frame attitudes towards the highlands and to create a cultural gulf with the lowlands.<ref name="Wormald1991pp60-7"/> 

It was Scots that emerged as the language of national literature in Scotland. The first surviving major text is [[John Barbour (poet)|John Barbour]]'s ''[[The Brus|Brus]]'' (1375), composed under the patronage of Robert II and telling the story in epic poetry of Robert I's actions before the English invasion until the end of the war of independence.<ref>A. A. M. Duncan, ed., ''The Brus'' (Canongate, 1997), ISBN 0-86241-681-7, p. 3.</ref> The work was extremely popular among the Scots-speaking aristocracy and Barbour is referred to as the father of Scots poetry, holding a similar place to his contemporary [[Chaucer]] in England.<ref>N. Jayapalan, ''History of English Literature'' (New Delhi: Atlantic, 2001), ISBN 81-269-0041-5, p. 23.</ref> In the early 15th century these were followed by [[Andrew of Wyntoun]]'s verse ''Orygynale Cronykil of Scotland'' and [[Blind Harry]]'s ''[[The Actes and Deidis of the Illustre and Vallyeant Campioun Schir William Wallace|The Wallace]]'', which blended [[romance (heroic literature)|historical romance]] with the [[chronicle|verse chronicle]]. They were probably influenced by Scots versions of popular French romances that were also produced in the period, including ''[[The Buik of Alexander]]'', ''[[Lancelot|Launcelot o the Laik]]'' and ''The Porteous of Noblenes'' by [[Gilbert Hay (poet)|Gibert Hay]].<ref name="Wormald1991pp60-7"/> 

[[File:Seal of Gavin Douglas.jpg|thumb|left|The seal of [[Gavin Douglas]], Bishop of Dunkeld, makar and translator.]]
Much Middle Scots literature was produced by [[makars]], poets with links to the royal court. These included [[James I of Scotland|James I]] who wrote ''[[The Kingis Quair]]''. Many of the makars had university education and so were also connected with the [[Ecclesia (church)|Kirk]]. However, Dunbar's ''[[Lament for the Makaris]]'' (c.1505) provides evidence of a wider tradition of secular writing outside of Court and Kirk now largely lost.<ref>A. Grant, ''Independence and Nationhood, Scotland 1306-1469'' (Baltimore: Edward Arnold, 1984), pp. 102-3.</ref> Before the advent of printing in Scotland, writers such as [[Robert Henryson]], [[William Dunbar]], [[Walter Kennedy]] and [[Gavin Douglas]] have been seen as leading a golden age in Scottish poetry.<ref name="Wormald1991pp60-7"/>  

In the late 15th century, Scots prose also began to develop as a genre. Although there are earlier fragments of original Scots prose, such as the ''Auchinleck Chronicle'',<ref>T. Thomson, ed., ''[http://www.archive.org/stream/auchinleckchron00thomgoog#page/n1/mode/1up Auchinleck Chronicle]'' (Edinburgh, 1819).</ref> the first complete surviving works include John Ireland's ''The Meroure of Wyssdome'' (1490).<ref>J. Martin, ''Kingship and Love in Scottish Poetry, 1424-1540'' (Aldershot: Ashgate, 2008), ISBN 0-7546-6273-X, p. 111.</ref> There were also prose translations of French books of chivalry that survive from the 1450s, including ''The Book of the Law of Armys'' and the ''Order of Knychthode'' and the treatise ''[[Secretum Secretorum|Secreta Secetorum]]'', an Arabic work believed to be Aristotle's advice to [[Alexander the Great]].<ref name="Wormald1991pp60-7"/> The landmark work in the reign of [[James IV of Scotland|James IV]] was [[Gavin Douglas]]'s version of [[Virgil]]'s ''[[Aeneid]]'', the ''[[Eneados]]'', which was the first complete translation of a major classical text in an [[Old English|Anglian]] language, finished in 1513, but overshadowed by the disaster at Flodden.<ref name="Wormald1991pp60-7"/>

==National identity==
{{Main|Scottish national identity}}
The late Middle Ages has often been seen as the era in which Scottish national identity was initially forged, in opposition to English attempts to annex the country and as a result of social and cultural changes. English invasions and interference in Scotland have been judged to have created a sense of national unity and a hatred towards England which dominated Scottish foreign policy well into the 15th century, making it extremely difficult for Scottish kings like James III and James IV to pursue policies of peace towards their southern neighbour.<ref>A. D. M. Barrell, ''Medieval Scotland'' (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2000), ISBN 0-521-58602-X, p. 134.</ref> In particular the ''Declaration of Arbroath'' asserted the ancient distinctiveness of Scotland in the face of English aggression, arguing that it was the role of the king to defend the independence of the community of Scotland. This document has been seen as the first "nationalist theory of sovereignty".<ref name=Kidd2003pp17-18>C.

The adoption of Middle Scots by the aristocracy has been seen as building a shared sense of national solidarity and culture between rulers and ruled, although the fact that north of the Tay Gaelic still dominated may have helped widen the cultural divide between highlands and lowlands.<ref name=Wormald1991pp55-7/> The national literature of Scotland created in the late medieval period employed legend and history in the service of the Crown and nationalism, helping to foster a sense of national identity at least within its elite audience. The epic poetic history of the ''Brus'' and ''Wallace'' helped outline a narrative of united struggle against the English enemy. Arthurian literature differed from conventional version of the legend by treating [[King Arthur|Arthur]] as a villain and [[Mordred]], the son of the king of the Picts, as a hero.<ref name=Wormald1991pp55-7>J. Wormald, ''Court, Kirk, and Community: Scotland, 1470-1625'' (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 1991), ISBN 0-7486-0276-3, pp. 66-7.</ref> The origin myth of the Scots, systematised by [[John of Fordun]] (c. 1320-c. 1384), traced their beginnings from the Greek prince [[Gathelus]] and his Egyptian wife [[Scota]], allowing them to argue superiority over the English, who claimed their descent from the Trojans, who had been defeated by the Greeks.<ref name=Kidd2003pp17-18/>

It was in this period that the national flag emerged as a common symbol. The image of St. Andrew, martyred while bound to an X-shaped cross, first appeared in the [[Kingdom of Scotland]] during the reign of [[William I of Scotland|William I]] and was again depicted on [[Seal (emblem)|seals]] used during the late 13th century; including on one particular example used by the [[Guardians of Scotland]], dated 1286.<ref name='NAS'>[http://www.nas.gov.uk/about/051124.asp "Feature: Saint Andrew seals Scotland's independence"], ''The National Archives of Scotland'', 28 November 2007, retrieved 12 September 2009.</ref> Use of a simplified symbol associated with Saint Andrew, the [[saltire]], has its origins in the late 14th century; the [[Parliament of Scotland]] decreed in 1385 that Scottish soldiers should wear a white Saint Andrew's Cross on their person, both in front and behind, for the purpose of identification. Use of a blue background for the Saint Andrew's Cross is said to date from at least the 15th century.<ref>G.
