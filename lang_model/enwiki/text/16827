===Trade War with Byzantium and Magyar invasions===
{{see also|Byzantine-Bulgarian Wars}}
With Simeon on the throne, the long-lasting peace with the Byzantine Empire established by his father was not to last much longer. A conflict arose when [[Byzantine Emperor]] [[Leo VI the Wise]], acting under pressure from his wife [[Zoe Karbonopsina]] and her father, moved the marketplace for Bulgarian goods from Constantinople to [[Thessaloniki]],<ref name=delev9/> where the Bulgarian merchants were heavily taxed. The Bulgarians sought protection by Simeon, who in turn complained to Leo. However, the Byzantine emperor ignored his embassy.<ref>[[John Skylitzes]]. Skylitzes&ndash;Kedrenos, II, p. 254.<sub>4<U+2013>16</sub></ref><ref>Runciman, ''A history of the First Bulgarian Empire'', pp. 144-145.</ref>
[[Image:Bulgaria Simeon I (893-927).svg|right|thumb|360px|Map of Bulgaria's greatest territorial extent during the reign of Simeon I]]

Forced to take action, in the autumn of 894 Simeon invaded the Byzantine Empire from the north, meeting with little opposition<ref>Zlatarski, ''Istorija na P<U+01CE>rvoto b<U+01CE>lgarsko carstvo'', p. 289.</ref> due to the concentration of most Byzantine forces in eastern [[Anatolia]] to counter [[Arab]] invasions.<ref>[[Theophanes the Confessor|Theophanes]] Continuatus, p. 312., cited in {{cite book |last=Vasil'ev |first=A. |title=Vizantija i araby, II |year=1902 |pages=p. 88, p. 104, pp. 108-111 |language=Russian }}</ref> Informed of the Bulgarian offensive, the surprised Leo sent an army consisting of guardsmen and other military units from the capital to halt Simeon, but his troops were routed<ref name=delev9/><ref name=canev-p198>Canev, ''B<U+01CE>lgarski hroniki'', p. 198.</ref> somewhere in the [[Macedonia (theme)|theme of Macedonia]].<ref name=bakalov/> The Bulgarians took most of the [[Khazars|Khazar]] mercenary guardsmen prisoners and killed many [[archon]]s, including the army's commander. However, instead of continuing his advance to the Byzantine capital, Simeon quickly withdrew his troops to face a [[Magyars|Magyar]] invasion from the north.<ref>Zlatarski, ''Istorija na P<U+01CE>rvoto b<U+01CE>lgarsko carstvo'', pp. 289-291.</ref> These events were later called "the first trade war in [[Middle Ages|medieval]] [[Europe]]" by Bulgarian historians.<ref name=canev-p198/>

Unable to effectively respond to the Bulgarian campaign due to the engagement of their forces against the Arabs, the Byzantines convinced the Magyars to attack Bulgaria,<ref name=delev9/> promising to transport them across the [[Danube]] using the [[Byzantine navy]].<ref name=canev-p198/><ref>Runciman, ''A history of the First Bulgarian Empire'', p. 145.</ref> Leo VI may have also concluded an agreement with Arnulf to make sure that the [[Franks]] did not support Simeon against the Magyars.<ref>Zlatarski, ''Istorija na P<U+01CE>rvoto b<U+01CE>lgarsko carstvo'', pp. 294-295.</ref> In addition, the talented commander Nikephoros Phokas was called back from [[Italy]] to lead a separate army against Bulgaria in 895 with the mere intention to overawe the Bulgarians.<ref>Runciman, ''A history of the First Bulgarian Empire'', p. 146.</ref> Simeon, unaware of the threat from the north, rushed to meet Phokas' forces, but the two armies did not engage in a fight.<ref>Zlatarski, ''Istorija na P<U+01CE>rvoto b<U+01CE>lgarsko carstvo'', p. 295.</ref> Instead, the Byzantines offered peace, informing him of both the Byzantine foot and maritime campaign, but intentionally did not notify him of the planned Magyar attack. Simeon did not trust the envoy and, after sending him to prison, ordered the Byzantine navy's route into the Danube closed off with ropes and chains, intending to hold it until he had dealt with Phokas.<ref>Zlatarski, ''Istorija na P<U+01CE>rvoto b<U+01CE>lgarsko carstvo'', pp. 296-297.</ref>

Despite the problems they encountered because of the fencing, the Byzantines ultimately managed to ferry the Magyar forces led by [[<U+00C1>rp<U+00E1>d]]'s son Li<U+00FC>ntika across the Danube,<ref>Zlatarski, ''Istorija na P<U+01CE>rvoto b<U+01CE>lgarsko carstvo'', p. 297.</ref> possibly near modern [[Gala<U+0163>i]],<ref>According to [[toponymy|toponymic]] evidence. {{cite book |title=Relationum Hungarorum cum oriente gentibusque originis historia antiquissima |last=Kuun |first=G<U+00E9>za |year=1895 |pages=p. 23 |language=Latin }}</ref> and assisted them in pillaging the nearby Bulgarian lands. Once notified of the surprise invasion, Simeon headed north to stop the Magyars, leaving some of his troops at the southern border to prevent a possible attack by Phokas.<ref name=zlat-pp298-299>Zlatarski, ''Istorija na P<U+01CE>rvoto b<U+01CE>lgarsko carstvo'', pp. 298-299.</ref> Simeon's two encounters with the enemy in [[Northern Dobruja]] resulted in Magyar victories,<ref name=delev9/> forcing him to retreat to [[Silistra|Dr<U+01CE>st<U+01CE>r]].<ref name=zlat-pp298-299/><ref>Canev, ''B<U+01CE>lgarski hroniki'', p. 199.</ref> After pillaging much of Bulgaria and reaching Preslav, the Magyars returned to their lands,<ref>Bakalov, ''Istorija na B<U+01CE>lgarija'', "Simeon I Veliki".<br>* Delev, ''B<U+01CE>lgarskata d<U+01CE>r<U+017E>ava pri car Simeon''.<br> * Canev, ''B<U+01CE>lgarski hroniki'', p. 199.</ref> but not before Simeon had concluded an armistice with Byzantium towards the summer of 895.<ref>Runciman, ''A history of the First Bulgarian Empire'', p. 146.</ref> A complete peace was delayed, as Leo VI required the release of the Byzantine captives from the Trade War.<ref>Zlatarski, ''Istorija na P<U+01CE>rvoto b<U+01CE>lgarsko carstvo'', pp. 301-304.</ref>

===Anti-Magyar campaign and further wars with Byzantium===
Having dealt with the pressure from the Magyars and the Byzantines, Simeon was free to plan a campaign against the Magyars looking for retribution. He negotiated a joint force with the Magyars' eastern neighbours, the [[Pechenegs]], and imprisoned the Byzantine envoy Leo Magister in order to delay the release of the captives until after the campaign against the Magyars.<ref>Zlatarski, ''Istorija na P<U+01CE>rvoto b<U+01CE>lgarsko carstvo'', p. 304.</ref> This would allow him to renegotiate the peace conditions in his favour. In an exchange of letters with the envoy, Simeon refused to release the captives and ridiculed Leo VI's [[astrology|astrological]] abilities.<ref>Zlatarski, ''Istorija na P<U+01CE>rvoto b<U+01CE>lgarsko carstvo'', pp. 304-311.</ref><ref name=delev9/>

Using a Magyar invasion in the lands of the neighbouring Slavs in 896 as a ''[[casus belli]]'', Simeon headed against the Magyars together with his Pecheneg allies, defeating them completely<ref>Runciman, ''A history of the First Bulgarian Empire'', p. 147.</ref> in the [[Battle of Southern Buh]] and making them leave [[Etelk<U+00F6>z]] forever and settle in [[Pannonia]].<ref name=bakalov/><ref name=delev9/> Following the defeat of the Magyars, Simeon finally released the Byzantine prisoners in exchange for Bulgarians captured in 895.<ref name=delev9/>

Claiming that not all prisoners had been released,<ref>Runciman, ''A history of the First Bulgarian Empire'', p. 147.</ref> Simeon once again invaded Byzantium in the summer of 896, heading directly to Constantinople.<ref>Zlatarski, ''Istorija na P<U+01CE>rvoto b<U+01CE>lgarsko carstvo'', p. 315.</ref> He was met in [[Thrace]] by a hastily-assembled Byzantine army, but annihilated the Byzantine forces in the [[Battle of Bulgarophygon]] (at modern [[Babaeski]], [[Turkey]]).<ref name=delev9/><ref>Zlatarski, ''Istorija na P<U+01CE>rvoto b<U+01CE>lgarsko carstvo'', p. 316.</ref> Arming Arab captives and sending them to fight with the Bulgarians as a desperate measure, Leo VI managed to repel the Bulgarians from Constantinople, which they had besieged.<ref name=delev9/><ref>Zlatarski, ''Istorija na P<U+01CE>rvoto b<U+01CE>lgarsko carstvo'', p. 317.</ref> The war ended with a peace treaty which formally lasted until around Leo VI's death in 912<ref name=bakalov/> and under which Byzantium was obliged to pay Bulgaria an annual tribute.<ref>Runciman, ''A history of the First Bulgarian Empire'', p. 148.</ref> Under the treaty, the Byzantines also ceded an area between the Black Sea and [[Strandzha|Strand<U+017E>a]] to the Bulgarian Empire.<ref>Zlatarski, ''Istorija na P<U+01CE>rvoto b<U+01CE>lgarsko carstvo'', pp. 318-321.</ref> Meanwhile, Simeon had also imposed his authority over Serbia in return for recognizing [[Archont Petar|Petar Gojnikovi<U+0107>]] as their ruler.<ref>Fine, ''The Early Medieval Balkans'', p. 141.</ref>

Simeon often violated the peace treaty with Byzantium, attacking and conquering Byzantine territory on several occasions,<ref>Zlatarski, ''Istorija na P<U+01CE>rvoto b<U+01CE>lgarsko carstvo'', p. 321.</ref> such as in 904, when the Bulgarian raids were used by Arabs led by the Byzantine renegade [[Leo of Tripoli]] to undertake a maritime campaign and seize Thessaloniki.<ref>Zlatarski, ''Istorija na P<U+01CE>rvoto b<U+01CE>lgarsko carstvo'', p. 324.</ref> After the Arabs plundered the city, it was an easy target for Bulgaria and the nearby Slavic tribes.

===Recognition as Emperor===
The death of Leo VI on [[11 May]] [[912]] and the accession of his infant son [[Constantine VII]] under the guidance of Leo's brother [[Alexander (emperor)|Alexander]], who expelled Leo's wife Zoe from the palace, constituted a great opportunity for Simeon to attempt another campaign against Constantinople, the conquest of which remained a dream of his all his life. In the spring of 913, Simeon's envoys, which had arrived in Constantinople to renew the peace of 896, were sent away by Alexander, who refused to pay the annual tribute, urging Simeon to prepare for war.<ref>Todt, ''Biographisch-Bibliographisches Kirchenlexikon''.<br> * Runciman, ''A history of the First Bulgarian Empire'', p. 155.<br> * Zlatarski, ''Istorija na P<U+01CE>rvoto b<U+01CE>lgarsko carstvo'', p. 352.<br> * ''B<U+01CE>lgarite i B<U+01CE>lgarija'', 1.2.</ref>

Before Simeon could attack, Alexander died on [[6 June]] [[912]], leaving the empire in the hands of a regency council headed by [[Patriarch of Constantinople|Patriarch]] [[Nicholas Mystikos]].<ref>Todt, ''Biographisch-Bibliographisches Kirchenlexikon''.<br> * Runciman, ''A history of the First Bulgarian Empire'', p. 155.<br> * Canev, ''B<U+01CE>lgarski hroniki'', p. 212.</ref> Many of the residents of Constantinople did not recognize the young emperor and supported the pretender Constantine Doukas,<ref>Runciman, ''A history of the First Bulgarian Empire'', p. 156.</ref> which, exacerbated by revolts in southern [[Italy]] and the planned Arab invasion in eastern Anatolia, was all to Simeon's advantage.<ref>Zlatarski, ''Istorija na P<U+01CE>rvoto b<U+01CE>lgarsko carstvo'', p. 353.</ref> Constantine Nicholas tried to discourage Simeon from invading Byzantium in a long series of pleading letters, but the Bulgarian ruler nevertheless attacked in full force in late July or August 913 and reached Constantinople without any serious resistance.<ref name=bg1-2>''B<U+01CE>lgarite i B<U+01CE>lgarija'', 1.2.</ref> However, the anarchy in Constantinople had ceased after the murder of the pretender Constantine Doukas and a government had promptly been formed with Patriarch Nicholas at the helm.<ref name=zlat-p359>Zlatarski, ''Istorija na P<U+01CE>rvoto b<U+01CE>lgarsko carstvo'', p. 359.</ref> This urged Simeon to raise his siege and enter peace negotiations, to the joy of the Byzantines.<ref name=zlat-p359/> The protracted negotiations resulted in the payment of the Byzantine tribute's [[arrears]],<ref>Runciman, ''A history of the First Bulgarian Empire'', p. 157.</ref> the promise that Constantine VII should marry one of Simeon's daughters<ref name=delev9/><ref name=bg1-2/> and, most importantly, Simeon's official recognition as Emperor of the Bulgarians by Patriarch Nicholas<ref>Fine, ''The Early Medieval Balkans'', pp. 144-148.</ref><ref>{{cite journal |first=George |last=Ostrogorsky |title=Avtokrator i samodr<U+017E>ac |journal=Glas Srpske kraljevske akademije |language=Serbian |issue=CLXIV |year=1935 |pages=pp. 95-187 }}</ref> in the [[Blachernae|Blachernai]] Palace.

Shortly after Simeon's visit to Constantinople, Constantine's mother Zoe returned to the palace on the insistence of the young emperor and immediately proceeded to eliminate the regents. Through a plot, she managed to assume power in February 914, practically removing Patriarch Nicholas from the government, disowning and obscuring his recognition of Simeon's imperial title<ref>{{cite journal |title=A re-examination of the <U+2018>coronation<U+2019> of Symeon of Bulgaria in 913 |last=Loud |first=G.A. |year=1978 |journal=The Journal of Theological Studies |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |issue= XXIX |pages=pp. 109-120 }}</ref> and rejecting the planned marriage of her son to one of Simeon's daughters.<ref>Zlatarski, ''Istorija na P<U+01CE>rvoto b<U+01CE>lgarsko carstvo'', pp. 367-368.</ref> Simeon had to resort to war to achieve his goals. He invaded Thrace in the summer of 914 and captured [[Edirne|Adrianople]]. Zoe was quick to send Simeon numerous presents in order to conciliate him and managed to convince him to cede back Adrianople and withdraw his army. In the following years, Simeon's forces were engaged in the northwestern Byzantine provinces, around Dra<U+010D> ([[Durr<U+00EB>s]]) and Thessaloniki, but did not make a move against Constantinople.<ref>Runciman, ''A history of the First Bulgarian Empire'', p. 158-159.</ref>

By 917, Simeon was preparing for yet another war against Byzantium. He attempted to conclude an anti-Byzantine union with the Pechenegs, but his envoys could not match the financial resources of the Byzantines, who succeeded in outbidding them.<ref>Runciman, ''A history of the First Bulgarian Empire'', p. 159.</ref> The Byzantines hatched a large-scale campaign against Bulgaria and also tried to persuade the Serbian Prince Petar Gojnikovi<U+0107> to attack the Bulgarians with Magyar support.<ref>Zlatarski, ''Istorija na P<U+01CE>rvoto b<U+01CE>lgarsko carstvo'', pp. 375-376.</ref>

In 917, a particularly strong Byzantine army led by Leo Phokas, son of Nikephoros Phokas, invaded Bulgaria accompanied by the Byzantine navy under the command of [[Romanos I|Romanos Lekapenos]], which sailed to the Bulgarian Black Sea ports. En route to Mesembria ([[Nesebar|Neseb<U+01CE>r]]), where they were supposed to be reinforced by troops transported by the navy, Phokas' forces stopped to rest near the river of Achelaos, not far from the port of Anchialos ([[Pomorie]]).<ref name=runciman-pp160-161>Runciman, ''A history of the First Bulgarian Empire'', pp. 160-161.</ref><ref>Zlatarski, ''Istorija na P<U+01CE>rvoto b<U+01CE>lgarsko carstvo'', pp. 376-377.</ref> Once informed of the invasion, Simeon rushed to intercept the Byzantines, and attacked them from the nearby hills while they were resting disorganized. In the [[Battle of Anchialus|Battle of Anchialos]] of [[20 August]] [[917]], one of the largest in medieval history,<ref>Dimitrov, ''Bulgaria: illustrated history''.</ref> the Bulgarians completely routed the Byzantines and killed many of their commanders, although Phokas managed to escape to Mesembria.<ref>{{cite web |title=Symeon of Bulgaria wins the Battle of Acheloos, 917 |author=Theophanes Continuatus, trans.

The planned Pecheneg attack from the north also failed, as the Pechenegs quarrelled with admiral Lekapenos, who refused to transport them across the Danube to aid the main Byzantine army.<ref name=runciman-pp160-161/> The Byzantines were not aided by Serbs and Magyars either: the Magyars were engaged in [[Western Europe]] as Frankish allies, and the Serbs under Petar Gojnikovi<U+0107> were reluctant to attack Bulgaria because the Bulgarian ally Mihailo Vi<U+0161>evi<U+0107> of [[Zahumlje]] had notified Simeon of their plans.<ref>Zlatarski, ''Istorija na P<U+01CE>rvoto b<U+01CE>lgarsko carstvo'', p. 370.</ref>

Simeon's army quickly followed up the victory of Anchialos with another success.<ref name=bg1-2/> The Bulgarians sent to pursuit the remnants of the Byzantine army approached Constantinople and encountered Byzantine forces under Leo Phokas, who had returned to the capital, at the village of [[battle of Katasyrtai|Katasyrtai]] in the immediate proximity of Constantinople.<ref>{{cite book |first=<U+0421>arl Gothard |last=De Boor |title=Vita Euthymii |pages=p. 214 |location=[[Berlin]] |publisher=Reimer |year=1888 }}</ref> The Bulgarian regiments attacked and again defeated the Byzantines, destroying some of their last units before returning to Bulgaria.<ref>Zlatarski, ''Istorija na P<U+01CE>rvoto b<U+01CE>lgarsko carstvo'', p. 382.</ref>

===Suppression of Serbian unrest and late campaigns against Byzantium===
Immediately after that campaign, Simeon sought to punish the Serbian ruler Petar Gojnikovi<U+0107> who had attempted to betray him by concluding an alliance with the Byzantines.<ref name=bakalov/> Simeon sent an army led by two of his commanders, [[Theodore Sigritsa|Theodore Sigrica]] and [[Marmais]], to Serbia. The two managed to persuade Petar to attend a personal meeting, during which he was enchained and carried off to Bulgaria, where he died in a dungeon. Simeon put Pavle Branovi<U+0107>, prior to that an exile in Bulgaria, on the Serbian throne, thus restoring the Bulgarian influence in Serbia for a while.<ref>Zlatarski, ''Istorija na P<U+01CE>rvoto b<U+01CE>lgarsko carstvo'', pp. 385-386.</ref>

Meanwhile, the Byzantine military failures forced another change of government in Constantinople: the admiral Romanos Lekapenos replaced Zoe as regent of the young Constantine VII in 919, forcing her back into a convent. Romanos betrothed his daughter Helena to Constantine and advanced to the rank of co-emperor in December 920, effectively assuming the government of the empire,<ref>{{cite book |title=[[Oxford Dictionary of Byzantium]] |editor=[[Alexander Kazhdan]] |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |year=1991 }}</ref><ref>Runciman, ''A history of the First Bulgarian Empire'', p. 163.</ref> which was largely what Simeon had planned to do.<ref>Canev, ''B<U+01CE>lgarski hroniki'', p. 217.</ref> 

No longer able to climb to the Byzantine throne by diplomatic means, the infuriated Simeon once again had to wage war to impose his will. Between 920 and 922, Bulgaria increased its pressure on Byzantium, campaigning in the west through [[Thessaly]] and in the east in Thrace, reaching the [[Dardanelles]] and the [[Isthmus of Corinth]].<ref name=delev9/><ref name=medlands>{{cite book |title=Medieval Lands |last=Cawley |first=Charles |chapter=Bulgaria: Symeon I 893&ndash;927 |url=http://fmg.ac/Projects/MedLands/ |chapterurl=http://fmg.ac/Projects/MedLands/BULGARIA.htm#_Toc137439346 |publisher=Foundation for Medieval Genealogy |date=2006<U+2013>2007 }}</ref> Simeon's forces appeared before Constantinople in 921, when they demanded the deposition of Romanos and captured Adrianople, and 922, when they were victorious at [[battle of Pigae|Pigae]], burned much of the [[Golden Horn]] and seized [[Vize|Bizye]].<ref name=runciman-pp164-165>Runciman, ''A history of the First Bulgarian Empire'', pp. 164-165.</ref><ref>''Vita S. Mariae Junioris''.</ref> In the meantime, the Byzantines attempted to ignite Serbia against Simeon, but he substituted Pavle with Zaharije Pribisavljevi<U+0107>, a former refugee at Constantinople that he had captured.<ref name=delev9/><ref name=runciman-pp164-165/>
[[Image:Skylitzes Simeon sending envoys to the Fatimids.jpg|right|thumb|320px|Simeon sending envoys to the Fatimids. Madrid Skylitzes.]]

Desperate to conquer Constantinople, Simeon planned a large campaign in 924 and sent envoys to the [[Fatimid]] caliph [[Ubayd Allah al-Mahdi Billah]], who possessed a powerful navy which Simeon needed. The caliph agreed and sent his own representatives back with the Bulgarians to arrange the alliance. However, the envoys were captured by the Byzantines at [[Calabria]]. Romanos offered peace to the Arabs, supplementing this offer with generous gifts, and ruined their union with Bulgaria.<ref name=delev9/><ref>Runciman, ''A history of the First Bulgarian Empire'', pp. 168-169.</ref>

In Serbia, Zaharije was persuaded by the Byzantines to revolt against Simeon. Zaharije was supported by many Bulgarians exhausted from Simeon's endless campaigns against Byzantium.<ref>Zlatarski, ''Istorija na P<U+01CE>rvoto b<U+01CE>lgarsko carstvo'', pp. 446-447.</ref> The Bulgarian emperor sent his troops under Sigrica and [[Marmais]], but they were routed and the two commanders beheaded, which forced Simeon to conclude an armistice with Byzantium in order to concentrate on the suppression of the uprising. The suppression was successful, as Zaharije fled to neighbouring [[Croatia]] and Serbia was put under direct Bulgarian control.<ref name=delev9/><ref>Zlatarski, ''Istorija na P<U+01CE>rvoto b<U+01CE>lgarsko carstvo'', p. 459.</ref>

In the summer of 924, Simeon nevertheless arrived at Constantinople and demanded to see the patriarch and the emperor. He conversed with Romanos on the Golden Horn on [[9 September]] [[924]] and arranged a truce, according to which Byzantium would pay Bulgaria an annual tax, but would be ceded back some cities on the Black Sea coast.<ref>Runciman, ''A history of the First Bulgarian Empire'', pp. 169-172.</ref> During the interview of the two monarchs, two eagles are said to have met in the skies above and then to have parted, one of them flying over Constantinople and the other heading to Thrace, as a sign of the irreconcilability of the two rulers.<ref>Theophanes Continuatus, pp. 405-407.</ref> In his description of this meeting, [[Theophanes the Confessor|Theophanes]] Continuatus mentions that "the two ''emperors''<U+2026> conversed", which may indicate renewed Byzantine recognition of Simeon's imperial claims.<ref>"t<U+00F4>n ''basile<U+00F4>n'' omilount<U+00F4>n". Discussed in {{cite web |url=http://homepage.mac.com/paulstephenson/trans/theocont3.html |title=The peace agreed between Romanos Lekapenos and Symeon of Bulgaria, AD 924 (translation of Theophanes Continuatus) |last=Stephenson |first=Paul |accessdate=2007-03-11 }}</ref>

===War with Croatia and death===
Most likely after (or possibly at the time of) Patriarch Nicholas' death in 925, Simeon raised the status of the Bulgarian Orthodox Church to a patriarchate.<ref>Fine, ''The Early Medieval Balkans'', p. 156.</ref> This may be linked to Simeon's diplomatic relations with the [[Papacy]] between 924 and 926, during which he demanded and received Pope [[John X]]'s recognition of his title as "Emperor of the Romans", truly equal to the Byzantine emperor, and possibly the confirmation of a patriarchal dignity for the head of the Bulgarian Orthodox Church.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Mladjov |first=Ian |title=Between Byzantium and Rome: Bulgaria and the West in the Aftermath of the Photian Schism |journal=Byzantine Studies/<U+00C9>tudes Byzantines |year=1999 |pages=pp. 173-181 }}</ref>

In 926, Simeon's troops invaded Croatia, at the time a Byzantine ally, but were completely defeated by the army of King [[Tomislav]] in the [[Battle of the Bosnian Highlands]].<ref name=bakalov/> Fearing a Bulgarian retribution, Tomislav accepted to abandon his union with Byzantium and make peace on the basis of the ''[[status quo]]'', negotiated by the papal legate Madalbert.<ref>Canev, ''B<U+01CE>lgarski hroniki'', p. 225.</ref><ref>Runciman, ''A history of the First Bulgarian Empire'', p. 176.</ref> In the last months of his life, Simeon prepared for another siege of Constantinople<ref name=medlands/> despite Romanos' desperate pleas for peace.<ref>Zlatarski, ''Istorija na P<U+01CE>rvoto b<U+01CE>lgarsko carstvo'', pp. 489-491.</ref>

On [[27 May]] [[927]], Simeon died of [[heart failure]] in his palace in Preslav. Byzantine chroniclers tie his death to a legend, according to which Romanos decapitated a statue which was Simeon's inanimate double, and he died at that very hour.<ref>Runciman, ''A history of the First Bulgarian Empire'', pp. 176-77.</ref><ref>Canev, ''B<U+01CE>lgarski hroniki'', p. 226-227.</ref>

He was succeeded by his son [[Peter I of Bulgaria|Peter I]], with George Sursuvul, the new emperor's maternal uncle, initially acting as a regent.<ref name=medlands/> As part of the peace treaty which Bulgaria and Byzantium signed in October 927 and Peter's marriage to Maria (Eirene), Romanos' granddaughter, the existing borders were confirmed, as were the Bulgarian ruler's imperial dignity and the head of the Bulgarian Church's patriarchal status.<ref>Fine, ''The Early Medieval Balkans''.</ref>

During Simeon's reign, Bulgaria reached its cultural apogee, becoming the literary and spiritual centre of [[Slavic Europe]].<ref name="lalkov-pp23-25"/><ref name=delev10>Delev, ''Zlatnijat vek na b<U+01CE>lgarskata kultura''.</ref> In this respect, Simeon continued his father Boris' policy of establishing and spreading Slavic culture and attracting noted scholars and writers within Bulgaria's borders. It was in the [[Preslav Literary School]] and [[Ohrid Literary School]], founded under Boris, that the main literary work in Bulgaria was concentrated during the reign of Simeon.<ref name=slovotointro>Ivanova, "[http://knigite.abv.bg/zv/zv_uvod.html Introduction]", ''T<U+01CE>r<U+017E>estvo na slovoto''.</ref>

[[Image:St. Theodor.jpg|left|thumb|180px|Ceramic icon of Saint Theodore dating to Simeon's reign]]
The late 9th and early 10th century constitute the earliest and most productive period of medieval [[Bulgarian literature]].<ref name=slovotointro/> Having spent his early years in Constantinople, Simeon introduced Byzantine culture to the Bulgarian court, but eliminated its assimilative effect by means of military power and religious autonomy.<ref name=slovotointro/> The disciples of [[Cyril and Methodius]], among whom [[Clement of Ohrid]], [[Saint Naum|Naum]] and [[Constantine of Preslav]], continued their educational work in Bulgaria, actively translating Christian texts, such as the [[Bible]] and the works of [[John Chrysostom]], [[Basil of Caesarea]], [[Cyril of Alexandria]], [[Gregory of Nazianzus]], [[Athanasius of Alexandria]], as well as historic chronicles such as these of [[John Malalas]] and [[George Hamartolus]], to Bulgarian.<ref name=slovotointro/> The reign of Simeon also witnessed the production of a number of original theological and secular works, such as [[John Exarch]]'s ''Six Days'' (''<U+0160>estodnev''), Constantine of Preslav's ''Alphabetical Prayer'' and ''Proclamation of the Holy Gospels'', and [[Chernorizets Hrabar|<U+010C>ernorizec Hrab<U+01CE>r]]'s ''An Account of Letters''.<ref name=slovotointro/> Simeon's own contribution to this literary blossoming was praised by his contemporaries, for example in the ''Praise to Tsar Simeon'' preserved in the ''Zlatostruj'' collection and ''Simeon's Collection'',<ref name=delev10/> to which the tsar personally wrote an addendum.<ref>Ivanova, "[http://knigite.abv.bg/zv/zv1_4.html Pribavka ot samija hristoljubiv car Simeon]", ''T<U+01CE>r<U+017E>estvo na slovoto''.</ref>

Simeon turned the new Bulgarian capital Preslav into a magnificent religious and cultural centre, intended more as a display of his realm's heyday and as a royal residence than as a military fortress.<ref name=delev10/> With its more than twenty cross-domed churches and numerous monasteries, its impressive royal palace and the royal Golden (or Round) Basilica, Preslav was a true imperial capital.<ref name=delev10/> The development of Bulgarian art in the period is demonstrated by a ceramic icon of [[Theodore of Amasea]] and the Preslav-style illustrated ceramics.<ref>{{cite web |title=Risuvana keramika |publisher=Muzej Preslav |url=http://www.museum-preslav.com/colectr.html |accessdate=2007-03-10 }}</ref>

==Family==
Simeon was married twice. By his first wife, whose identity is unknown, Simeon had a son called [[Mihail of Bulgaria|Michael]],<ref>Fine, ''The Early Medieval Balkans'', p. 160.</ref> who was born before 913. He was excluded from the succession in 927 and sent to a monastery. He died in 931, shortly after organizing a revolt.<ref name=medlands/>

By his second wife, the daughter of the influential noble George Sursuvul, he had three sons: [[Peter I of Bulgaria|Peter]], who succeeded as Emperor of Bulgaria in 927 and ruled until 969; Ivan, who rebelled against Peter in 928 and then fled to Byzantium;<ref name=medlands/> and Benjamin (Bajan), who, according to [[Lombards|Lombard]] historian [[Liutprand of Cremona]], "possessed the power to transform himself suddenly into a wolf or other strange animal".<ref>''Antapodosis'', p. 309.</ref>

Simeon also had several daughters, including one who was arranged to marry Constantine VII in 913, and was thus born before that date.<ref name=medlands/> The marriage was annulled by Constantine's mother Zoe once she had returned to the court.<ref>Fine, ''The Early Medieval Balkans'', p. 148.</ref>
