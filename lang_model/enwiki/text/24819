The '''Murder of Brian Stidham''' took place in [[2004]] when Dr. Brian Stidham was stabbed and murdered by his business partner.  This is notable because it made national news, national TV and continues to have some coverage.  The story was so notable that even the UK press covered it.  It was on UK TV 31 July 2009 for an hour as well as covered on American TV for an hour in 2007, two years after the murder.

==Brian Stidham==
Stidham was a pediatric opthalmologist in Tucson, AZ.  That is an eye doctor who works on children.  An opthalmologist is a M.D. or doctor, which is different from an optometrist, who is not a doctor in the UK (but they are called doctors in the US).  He went to Harvard Medical School.  On or about October 5, 2004, he was kidnapped and stabbed 15-17 times resulting in his death.  He was killed in his white Lexus car and dragged from his car to make it look like a robbery.

There is much more information about Stidham's educational background.  He attended Columbia University for college then went to [[Harvard Medical School]].

==Bradley A. Schwartz==
Schwartz was a pediatric opthalmologist in [[Tucson]], AZ.  He hired Stidham after medical school but the partnership dissolved.  Schwartz thought Stidham was stealing his patients.  He alledgedly told his friends that he wanted to kill Stidham.

After police found the body they suspected Schwartz.  They raided his house where they found him naked.  They took him away with such haste that his shirt was on backwards.  Schwartz hired a hit man to help him.

==Trial==
Schwartz was convicted and sentenced to life in prison.  He will not be eligible for parole for 25 years.  In 2006, he was beaten up so badly in prison that he had to go to the intensive care unit and had to have several operations.  Other inmates thought his family had money and wanted some of it.

==County knew about murder plans, settles for $2M==
The murder victim's wife claims that a county attorney and a county prosecutor both knew of the murder plans and did nothing.  She sued for $20M and got $2.29M.

==Book==
A.J. Flick wrote a book about this murder.  That made it even more notable to the world and country.
