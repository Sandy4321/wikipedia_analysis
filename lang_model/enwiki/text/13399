'''Route 286''' is a short, east&ndash;west [[state highway]] in [[Salisbury, Massachusetts]] and [[Seabrook, New Hampshire]].  

==Route description==
The eastern terminus of Route 286 is at the junction with [[New Hampshire Route 1A]] (Ocean Boulevard), which runs north<U+2013>south along the Atlantic shore, approximately 160 feet (55 m) north of the Massachusetts/New Hampshire state line. The road continues into Massachusetts on Collins Street in Salisbury, and then connects with [[U.S. Route 1]] and [[Interstate 95 in Massachusetts|Interstate 95]]. Some maps incorrectly<ref>Correct depiction shown on [[U.S. Geological Survey]] 7.5-minute Newburyport quadrangle ([http://www.topozone.com/map.asp?lat=42.86239&lon=-70.83082&datum=nad27&u=4&layer=DRG&size=l&s=50  Topozone.com])</ref> show the New Hampshire section of Route 286 briefly crossing into Massachusetts, just west of its terminus at NH Route 1A.

The total length of Route 286 is approximately 3.7 miles (6.0 km), of which approximately 2.3 miles (3.8 km) is in New Hampshire.  The total length of Route 286 in Massachusetts is approximately 1.4 miles (2.25 km).

==History==
[[Image:I-86.svg|70px|right|thumb|Route 286 was renumbered to make room for the defunct I-86, now designated as part of [[I-84 (east)|I-84]].]]

</div></div>
Route 286 was previously designated as [[Massachusetts Route 86|Route 86]] in both Massachusetts and New Hampshire.

Between [[1971]] and [[1984]], Massachusetts had an [[Interstate 86 (Connecticut-Massachusetts)|Interstate 86]], which ran from [[Sturbridge, Massachusetts]], to [[Hartford, Connecticut]].  The construction of I-86 prompted Massachusetts Route 86 to be renumbered to "286" because, according to [[Massachusetts Highway Department|MassHighway]] protocol, a state highway and an interstate highway may not share the same number.  (The only exception to this rule is [[Massachusetts Route 295]] and [[Interstate 295 (Massachusetts)|I-295]], which are on opposite ends of the state.)  When Massachusetts renumbered Route 86 to 286, New Hampshire matched the change on its section.  

In 1984, plans to connect [[Interstate 84 (east)|I-84]] along the present day [[Interstate 384|I-384]]/[[U.S. Route 6|US 6]] corridor from Hartford to [[Providence, Rhode Island|Providence]] was scuttled for environmental reasons.  As a result, I-84 was rerouted onto the completed I-86 freeway. The existing section of the old I-84 became [[Interstate 384 (Connecticut)|I-384]].
The Massachusetts State Route has kept the 286 number, and by extension the New Hampshire road has as well.

Today [[Interstate 86 (east)|I-86]] is the former [[NY Route 17|Southern Tier Expressway/NY-17]] in [[New York|New York State]] as that road is upgraded to [[Interstate Highway standards]].  Modern I-86 is unrelated to the I-86 that existed in Massachusetts.
