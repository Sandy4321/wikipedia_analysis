The '''Hockey Hall of Fame''' is located in [[Toronto]], [[Ontario]], [[Canada]]. Dedicated to the [[history of ice hockey|history]] of [[ice hockey]], it is both a museum and a Hall of Fame. It holds exhibits about players, teams, [[National Hockey League|National Hockey League (NHL)]] records, memorabilia and NHL [[National Hockey League awards|trophies]], including the [[Stanley Cup]]. Originally in [[Kingston, Ontario]], the Hockey Hall of Fame was first established in 1943 under the leadership of [[James T. Sutherland]]. The first class of honoured members was inducted in 1945, before the Hall of Fame had a permanent location. It moved to Toronto in 1958 after the NHL withdrew its support for the Kingston location. Its first permanent building opened at [[Exhibition Place]] in 1961. Because the Hall was outgrowing its location, it was relocated to a former [[Bank of Montreal]] building in downtown Toronto in 1993, where it is currently located. 

An 18-person committee of players, coaches and others meets annually in June to select new honourees, who are inducted as players, [[List_of_members_of_the_Hockey_Hall_of_Fame#Builders|builders]] or on-ice officials. The builders' category includes [[coach]]es, [[List of National Hockey League General Managers|general manager]]s, commentators, team owners and others who have helped build the game. Honoured members are inducted into the Hall of Fame in an annual ceremony held at the Hall of Fame building in November, which is followed by a special "Hockey Hall of Fame Game" between the [[Toronto Maple Leafs]] and a visiting team. As of 2007, 238&nbsp;players, 96&nbsp;[[List_of_members_of_the_Hockey_Hall_of_Fame#Builders|builders]] and 14&nbsp;[[Official (ice hockey)|on-ice officials]] have been inducted into the Hall of Fame. The Hall of Fame has been criticized for focusing mainly on players from the National Hockey League and largely ignoring players from other international and North American leagues.

==History==
[[Image:Hockey Hall of Fame.JPG|thumb|300px|right|The Hockey Hall of Fame is located at the corner of Front and Yonge Streets in downtown [[Toronto]].]]
The Hockey Hall of Fame was established through the efforts of [[James T. Sutherland]], a former President of the [[Canadian Amateur Hockey Association]]. Sutherland sought to establish it in [[Kingston, Ontario]] as he believed that the city was the birthplace of hockey.<ref name="p1"/> In 1943, the [[National Hockey League|NHL]] and [[Canadian Amateur Hockey Association|CAHA]] reached an agreement that a Hall of Fame would be established in Kingston.<ref name="p1"/>  Originally called the "International Hockey Hall of Fame", its mandate was to honour great hockey players and to raise funds for a permanent location. The first eleven "honoured members" were inducted on [[April 30]], [[1945]], although the Hall of Fame still did not have a permanent home.<ref name="p1">''Honoured members: the Hockey Hall of Fame'', p. 1</ref> Kingston lost its most influential advocate as permanent site of the Hockey Hall of Fame when Sutherland died in 1955.<ref name="p25"/> 
[[Image:Hhof olympics2.jpg|left|150px|thumb|The "World of Hockey Zone", which opened in 1998, is dedicated to international and Olympic hockey.]]

By 1958, the Hockey Hall of Fame had still not raised sufficient funds to construct a permanent building in Kingston. [[Clarence Campbell]], then president of the NHL, grew tired of waiting for the construction to begin and withdrew the NHL's support to situate the Hall in Kingston.<ref name="history">{{cite web|url=http://www.hhof.com/html/gi20300.shtml|title=The History of the Hockey Hall of Fame|accessdate=2007-12-26|publisher=Hockey Hall of Fame}}</ref> In the same year, the NHL and the [[Canadian National Exhibition|Canadian National Exhibition (CNE)]] reached an agreement to establish a new Hall of Fame building in Toronto, in the [[Canadian Sports Hall of Fame]] located at [[Exhibition Place]]. The temporary Hockey Hall of Fame opened as an exhibit within the Canadian Sports Hall of Fame in August 1958, and 350,000 people visited it during the 1958 CNE fair.<ref name="p25">''Honoured members: the Hockey Hall of Fame'', p. 25</ref> Due to the success of the exhibit, NHL and CNE decided that a permanent home in the [[Exhibition Place]] was needed.<ref>''Honoured members: the Hockey Hall of Fame'', p. 33</ref> The NHL agreed to fully fund the building of the new facility on the grounds of Exhibition Place, and construction began in 1960.<ref>''Honoured members: the Hockey Hall of Fame'', p. 35</ref> The first permanent Hockey Hall of Fame was opened on [[August 26]], [[1961]], by Canadian Prime Minister [[John Diefenbaker]].<ref name=p39>''Honoured members: the Hockey Hall of Fame'', p. 39</ref> Over 750,000 people visited the Hall in its inaugural year.<ref>''Honoured members: the Hockey Hall of Fame'', p. 47</ref> Admission to the Hockey Hall of Fame was free until 1980, when the Hockey Hall of Fame facilities underwent expansion.<ref>{{cite news |title=Expanded hockey hall will charge admission |publisher=''The Globe and Mail'' |date=1980-06-06 |last=Patton|first=Paul}}</ref>

By 1986, the Hall of Fame was running out of room in its existing facilities and the Board of Directors decided that a new home was needed.<ref>''Honoured members: the Hockey Hall of Fame'', p. 155</ref> The Exhibition Place building closed in 1992. Development of the new location, the former [[Bank of Montreal]] at the corner of Yonge and Front Streets in Toronto, began soon after. The building, now part of Brookfield Place, was designed by [[Frank Darling (architect)|Frank Darling]] and [[S. George Curry]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://canada.archiseek.com/ontario/toronto/hockeyhalloffame.html |title=Hockey Hall of Fame (Former Bank of Montreal) |publisher=Archiseek |accessdate=December 8, 2007}}</ref> The new Hockey Hall of Fame officially opened on [[June 18]], [[1993]].<ref>{{cite news |title=Hall Marks its 10th Anniversary |publisher=''[[Toronto Sun]]'' |date=2003-06-15|last=Breslin|first=Lauren}}</ref> The new location has {{convert|4700|sqm|sqft|-2|abbr=on}} of exhibition space, seven times larger than that of the old facility.<ref>{{cite news |title=New Hockey Hall of Fame brilliant mix of the old and new |publisher=The Gazette (Montreal, Quebec) |date=1993-06-08|last=Ormsby|first=Mary}}</ref> The Hockey Hall of Fame now hosts more than 300,000 visitors each year.<ref name="steed">{{cite news |title=Canada's pride designed as a story |publisher=''[[Toronto Star]]'' |date=2002-06-10|last=Steed|first=Judy}}</ref><ref name="arace">{{cite news |title=Canada's Centerpiece |publisher=''Columbus Dispatch'' |date=1999-11-28 |last=Arace|first=Michael}}</ref>

==Operations and organization==
The first curator of the new Hall of Fame was [[Bobby Hewitson]]. Following Hewitson's retirement in 1967, [[Lefty Reid]] was appointed to the position. Reid was curator of the Hockey Hall of Fame for the next 25&nbsp;years, retiring in 1992.<ref name="Founders">{{cite web|url=http://www.hhof.com/html/gi20400.shtml|title=Founders & Leaders|accessdate=2007-12-26|publisher=Hockey Hall of Fame}}</ref> Following Reid's retirement, former NHL referee-in-chief [[Scotty Morrison]], who was the president of the Hockey Hall of Fame since 1986, was appointed curator.<ref name="Founders"/> Morrison supervised the relocation the Hall of Fame and its exhibits.<ref name="About"/>

While many of the Hall of Fame exhibits are dedicated to the NHL, there is a large section devoted to hockey leagues and players outside North America. On [[June 29]], [[1998]], the ''World of Hockey Zone'' opened.

:''See also: [[List of members of the Hockey Hall of Fame]].''
As of 2007, new members can be inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame as players, builders or on-ice officials. The builders' category includes [[coach]]es, [[List of National Hockey League General Managers|general manager]]s, commentators, team owners and others who have helped build the game.<ref name="Committee"/> The category fir on-ice officials was added in 1961<ref name=p39>''Honoured members: the Hockey Hall of Fame'', p. 39</ref> and a "veteran player" category was established in 1988. The purpose of the category was to "provide a vehicle for players who may have been overlooked and whose chances for election would be limited when placed on the same ballot with contemporary players."<ref name="Facts"/> Eleven players were inducted into that category, but in 2000, the Board of Directors eliminated it; the players who had been inducted under this category were merged into the player category.<ref name="Facts"/>

Candidates for membership in the Hockey Hall of Fame are nominated by an 18-person selection committee. The committee consists of Hockey Hall of Fame members, hockey personnel and media personalities associated with the game; the membership is representative of "areas throughout the world where hockey is popular",<ref name="Committee"/> and includes at least one member who is knowledgeable about international hockey and one member who is knowledgeable about amateur hockey. Committee members are appointed by the Board of Directors to a three-year term. The terms of the committee members are staggered so that each year there are six newly appointed or reappointed members.<ref name="Committee"/> As of 2007, the selection committee consists of: Chairman [[Jim Gregory (ice hockey)|James M. Gregory]], [[Scotty Bowman]], [[Colin Campbell]], Ed Chynoweth, [[John Davidson (hockey player)|John Davidson]], [[Eric Duhatschek]], Jan-Ake Edvinsson, [[Mike Emrick]], Michael Farber, [[Emile Francis]], [[Dick Irvin, Jr.]], [[Lanny McDonald]], [[Yvon Pedneault]], [[Pat Quinn]], [[Serge Savard]], [[Harry Sinden]], [[Peter Stastny]] and [[Bill Torrey]].<ref name="Committee">{{cite web|url=http://www.legendsofhockey.net/html/indselect.htm|title=Selection Committee By-Laws|accessdate=2007-12-25|publisher=Hockey Hall of Fame}}</ref>

Each committee member is allowed to nominate one person in each category per year. Nominations must be submitted to the Chairman of the Board of Directors by [[April 15]] of the nomination year. The committee then meets in June to vote by secret ballot on each nominee; candidates must receive the support of 75% of the members of the committee present, or a minimum of 10 votes. In any given year, a maximum of four players, two builders, and one referee or linesman are inducted as members. Player and on-ice officials must have been retired for a minimum of three years to be eligible for nomination. [[List_of_members_of_the_Hockey_Hall_of_Fame#Builders|Builders]] may be "active or inactive".<ref name="Bylaws">{{cite web|url=http://www.legendsofhockey.net/html/indelection.htm|title=Summary of Election Procedures|accessdate=2007-12-25|publisher=Hockey Hall of Fame}}</ref>

There is also a category for "Media honourees".

The induction ceremony was held at the Hall of Fame from 1959 until 1974. In 1975, it was held at the [[Royal York Hotel]] in Toronto and would be held there until 1979. From 1980 to 1992, the ceremony was held at various different locations in Toronto, except for 1986, 1987 and 1991 when the ceremonies were held in [[Vancouver]], [[Detroit]] and [[Ottawa]] respectively. Since 1993, it has been held at the current Hall of Fame building.<ref name="Facts"/> The ceremony was first broadcast by [[The Sports Network]] in 1994.<ref>''Honoured members: the Hockey Hall of Fame'', p. 194</ref> In 1999 the "Hockey Hall of Fame game" was established, a contest between the [[Toronto Maple Leafs]] and a visiting team, with a special ceremony honouring that year's inductees held before the game.<ref>''Honoured members: the Hockey Hall of Fame'', p. 207</ref>

=== Criticism ===
The Hall of Fame has been criticised for inducting several lackluster candidates in the early 2000s due to "a shortage of true greatness."<ref name="Ulmer"/> Since then, some have claimed that the Hall of Fame has become too exclusive.<ref name="Ulmer"/> The Hall of Fame has also been criticised for failing to induct international players and critics have claimed that the Hall has been far too focused on the National Hockey League. A common statement is that it is not the "NHL Hall of Fame".<ref name="Ulmer">{{cite web|url=http://slam.canoe.ca/Slam//Columnists/Ulmer/2006/06/30/1661550-sun.html|title=Hockey Hall just too tough |date=2006-06-30|last=Ulmer|first=Mike|accessdate=2007-12-25|publisher=[[Canadian Online Explorer]]}}</ref><ref name="2005class">{{cite news |title=Hall welcomes class of 2005: Neely, Kharlamov, Costello inducted into Hockey Hall of Fame |publisher=''[[Barrie Examiner]]'' |author=Canadian Press |date=2005-11-08}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://slam.canoe.ca/Slam/Hockey/News/2005/11/07/1296374-sun.html|title=Fitting tribute to hockey legend |date=2005-11-7|author=Ken Fidlin|accessdate=2007-12-25|publisher=''Toronto Sun''}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tsn.ca/nhl/news_story/?ID=212159&hubname=|title=It's the Hockey Hall of Fame, not the NHL Hall of Fame. |date=2007-06-28|author=Canadian Press|accessdate=2007-12-25|publisher=[[The Sports Network]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nhl/columns/story?columnist=frei_terry&id=2918472|title=Here's my final selections for the 2007 Hall class |date=2007-06-27|last=Frei|first=Terry|accessdate=2007-12-25|publisher=[[ESPN]]}}</ref> Partially in response to these claims, the Hall of Fame recently opened an International Hockey exhibit and has said it will start looking at more international players for induction.

One of the most discussed potential nominees is [[Paul Henderson]], who scored the winning goal in the final moments of the deciding eighth game of the [[Summit Series|1972 Summit Series]] between Canada and the Soviet Union.

===Controversy===
[[Frank J. Selke]] served as Chairman of the selection committee from 1960 until 1971, when he resigned because of the induction of [[Busher Jackson|Harvey Jackson]]. Jackson, known for his off-ice lifestyle, had died in 1966 of liver failure. Selke would not condone the induction and even tried to block it because he considered Jackson a poor role model.<ref>''Honoured members: the Hockey Hall of Fame'', p. 91</ref>

On [[March 30]], [[1993]], it was announced that [[Gil Stein (sports administrator)|Gil Stein]], who at the time was the president of the National Hockey League, would be inducted into the Hall of Fame. There were immediate allegations that he had engineered his election through manipulation of the hall's board of directors. Due to these allegations, NHL commissioner [[Gary Bettman]] hired two independent lawyers, Arnold Burns and [[Yves Fortier (lawyer)|Yves Fortier]], to lead an investigation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F0CE5DA1139F937A25754C0A965958260&partner=rssnyt&emc=rss|title=Stein Investigators Need More Time|date=1993-07-14|accessdate=2008-01-10|publisher=''New York Times''}}</ref> They concluded that Stein had "improperly manipulated the process" and "created the false appearance and illusion" that his nomination was the idea of [[Bruce McNall]].<ref name="Stein"/> They concluded that Stein pressured McNall to nominate him and had refused to withdraw his nomination when asked to do so by Bettman.<ref name="Stein">{{cite web|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F0CE5DD1E3BF93BA2575BC0A965958260|title=Stein Is Scratched as N.H.L.

In 1989, [[Alan Eagleson]], a long time executive director of the [[NHL Players Association|National Hockey League Players Association]], was inducted as a builder. He resigned nine years later from the Hall after pleading guilty to [[mail fraud]] and embezzling hundreds of thousands of dollars from the [[NHL Players Association]] pension funds.<ref>''Honoured members: the Hockey Hall of Fame'', p. 167</ref> His resignation came six days before a vote was scheduled to determine if he should be expelled from the Hall.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thestar.com/article/186055|title=Eagleson puts hockey memorabilia on block|date=2007-02-27|last=Hunter|first=Paul|accessdate=2008-01-10|publisher=''Toronto Star''}}</ref> Originally, the Hall of Fame was not going to become involved in the issue, but was forced to act when dozens of inductees, including [[Bobby Orr]], [[Ted Lindsay]] and [[Brad Park]], campaigned for Eagleson's expulsion, even threatening to renounce their membership if he was not removed. He became the first member of a sports hall of fame in North America to resign.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F0CE5DD1E3BF93BA2575BC0A965958260|title=Eagleson Resigns Under Pressure |date=1998-03-26|last=Lapointe|first=Joe|accessdate=2008-01-10|publisher=''New York Times''}}</ref>
