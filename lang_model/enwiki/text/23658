'''Kate Bush''' (born Catherine Bush [[30 July]], [[1958]], [[Bexleyheath]], [[Greater London]]) is an [[England|English]] singer, songwriter, musician and [[record producer]]. Her eclectic musical style and idiosyncratic lyrics have made her one of the [[United Kingdom]]'s most successful and original solo female performers of the past 30 years. 

[[Brit Award]]-winning and [[Grammy Award]]-nominated Bush was signed up by [[EMI]] at the age of 16 after being recommended by [[Pink Floyd]]'s [[David Gilmour]]. In 1978 at age 19, she debuted with the surprise hit "[[Wuthering Heights (song)|Wuthering Heights]]," topping the UK charts for four weeks and becoming the first woman to have a UK number one with a self-written song. She has since gone on to release eight albums, three of which topped the UK album charts, and have UK top ten hit singles with "[[Running Up That Hill]]," "[[King of the Mountain (song)|King of the Mountain]]," "[[Babooshka (song)|Babooshka]]," "[[The Man with the Child in His Eyes]]," and "[[Don't Give Up (Peter Gabriel and Kate Bush song)|Don't Give Up]]."

During her tour of 1979, the only tour of her career, she became the first ever singer to use a wireless headset radio microphone on stage. With her 1980 album ''[[Never for Ever]]'', she became the first solo female British singer to top the UK album charts. Her songwriting ability was recognised in 2002 with an [[Ivor Novello Award]] for "Outstanding Contribution to British Music." In 2005, she released ''[[Aerial (album)|Aerial]]'', her first album in 12 years. The album was a UK success and earned her Brit Award nominations for "Best Album" and "Best Solo Female Artist."

==Biography==
===Early life===
Bush was born to [[England|English]] [[physician]] Dr. Robert Bush and his [[Ireland|Irish]] wife Hannah. She was raised in their farmhouse in [[East Wickham]], on the border of [[Kent]] and [[London]], with her older brothers, John and Paddy.<ref name="salon.com">{{cite web  | title = Kate Bush  | publisher = Salon.com | url = http://archive.salon.com/people/bc/2001/03/20/kate_bush/index.html  | accessdate = 2007-04-22 }}</ref> Bush came from an artistic background; her mother was a former Irish folk dancer, her father was an accomplished pianist, her brother Paddy worked as a musical instrument maker, and John was a poet and photographer. Both brothers were involved in the local [[folk music]] scene.<ref name="Haunting Kate Bush">{{cite news  |last=Young |first=David |title = Haunting Kate Bush  | publisher = NZ Listener |date=[[1978-12-02]] }}</ref> Her family's musical influence inspired the young Kate to teach herself to play the piano at age 11. She soon began writing her own tunes and eventually added [[lyrics]] to them.<ref name="rebel">{{cite book  | last = Gaar  | first = Gillian  | title = She's A Rebel  | date =1993 }}</ref> At school, she was encouraged to take violin lessons, but the piano was her passion.<ref name="sing365.com">{{cite web  | title = Kate Bush Biography  | publisher = Sing365.com | url = http://www.sing365.com/music/lyric.nsf/Kate-Bush-Biography/9856004169D5F719482569A0002CFF33  | accessdate = 2007-04-22 }}</ref>  

In the mid 1970s, while attending St. Joseph's Convent Grammar school in [[Abbey Wood]], [[London]], [[David Gilmour]] of [[Pink Floyd]] was given a demo tape of Bush's songs by Ricky Hopper, a mutual friend of Gilmour and the Bush family. Impressed with what he heard, Gilmour helped her get a more professional sounding demo tape recorded that would be more saleable to the record companies.<ref name="NStatesman">{{cite news  | last = Cowley  | first = Jason  | title = The Wow Factor  | publisher = The New Statesman|date=[[2005-02-07]]}}</ref> The tape was produced by Gilmour's friend [[Andrew Powell]], who would go on to produce Bush's first two albums.<ref name="rebel"/> At the age of 16, Bush was signed up by [[EMI]] after being recommended by Gilmour.<ref name="EMI">{{cite web  | title = Kate Bush  | publisher = EMI | url = http://www.emi-premier.co.uk/loader.html  | accessdate = 2007-04-03 }}</ref> During the first two years of her contract, Bush did not work on an album but instead continued her time at school. She eventually left just after doing her mock [[Advanced Level (UK)|A-levels]] and having gained ten GCE [[O-Level]] qualifications.<ref name="MightyB">{{cite news  | last = Williamson  | first = Nigel  | title = The Mighty Bush  | publisher = Scotland on Sunday|date=[[2005-10-02]]}}</ref> In 2005, Bush stated in an interview with [[Mark Radcliffe]] on [[BBC Radio 2]] that she believed EMI signed her up before she was ready to make an album so that no other record company could offer her a contract. After the contract signing, EMI forwarded her a sizable amount of start-up money which she used to enroll in [[interpretive dance]] classes taught by [[Lindsay Kemp]], who was also a former teacher of [[David Bowie]].<ref name="Today's Style And Looks">{{cite news  | title = Today's Style And Looks  | publisher = Face & Figure  |date=1979 }}</ref> 

During this time, she gained experience performing by singing in a band called the KT Bush Band at various pubs around [[London]]. The band included her brother Paddy and then-boyfriend [[Del Palmer]]. She also wrote and made demos of close to 200 songs, a few of which today can be found on bootleg recordings and are known as the ''[[Phoenix Recordings]]''.<ref>{{cite web  | title = Demos: The Phoenix recordings  | publisher = Last.fm | url = http://www.last.fm/music/Kate+Bush/Demos%253A+The+Phoenix+recordings+%252F+Studio+Sessions  | accessdate = 2007-04-03 }}</ref> She began recording her first album in 1977.<ref name="rebel"/>

===1978<U+2013>1979===
[[Image:The Kick Inside UK cover.jpg|thumb|right|U.K. cover of 1978's ''[[The Kick Inside]]'']]
Her first album, ''[[The Kick Inside]]'', was released in 1978 and featured songs she had written during the previous several years, including her debut single, the high-pitched and ethereal "Wuthering Heights," which topped the UK and Australian charts and became an international hit. In doing so, Bush became the first woman to reach number one in the UK charts with a self-penned song.<ref name="GuardianProfile">{{cite news  | last = Barkham  | first = Patrick  | title = Guardian profile: Kate Bush  | publisher = The Guardian |  date=[[2005-09-28]] }}</ref> EMI originally wanted the more rock-orientated track "James and the Cold Gun" to be her debut song, but Bush insisted that it should be "Wuthering Heights." Even by this early stage of her career, she had gained a reputation as being determined to have a say in decisions affecting her work.<ref name="rebel"/>

The album was released when she was 19 years old, but some of the songs had been written when she was as young as 13.<ref name="h2g2">{{cite web|title = Kate Bush <U+2014> Singer-songwriter|publisher =BBC| date =[[2005-02-04]]| url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/h2g2/A3502568| accessdate = 2007-04-04 }}</ref> Two of the demos she recorded with Gilmour were included on the album: "The Saxophone Song" and "[[The Man With The Child In His Eyes]]."<ref name="rebel"/>

Bush's cinematic and literary influences, two qualities considered her trademarks, were most obvious in "Wuthering Heights." The song was not initially inspired by [[Emily Bront<U+00EB>]]'s [[Wuthering Heights|novel]], but by a television adaptation, although she did read the novel later to, in her own words, "get the research right."<ref name="Aspel78">{{cite news  | title = Kate Bush TV Interview | publisher = Ask Aspel|date=[[1978-09-05]] }}</ref> She makes reference to [[G. I. Gurdjieff|Gurdjieff]] in "Them Heavy People" and acknowledges David Gilmour's support in "Strange Phenomena," while the title song is based on the Ballad of Lizzie Wan, the story of a girl who kills herself after being impregnated by her brother. The album is also rather open about sexual matters, particularly on the erotic "Feel It" and "L'Amour Looks Something Like You." A second single, "The Man With The Child In His Eyes," was released to another warm reception, reaching #6 on the UK charts.<ref name="songfacts.com">{{cite web  | title = The Man With The Child In His Eyes  | publisher = Songfacts.com | url = http://www.songfacts.com/detail.php?id=4831  | accessdate = 2007-04-22 }}</ref> It even made it onto the American Hot 100 Billboard Charts, Bush's only single to do so until 1985. The song went on to win her an [[Ivor Novello Award]] in 1979 for "Outstanding British Lyric."<ref>{{cite web  | title = Awards Database  | publisher = The Envelope | url = http://theenvelope.latimes.com  | accessdate = 2007-04-03 }}</ref>

As part of her preparation for entering the studio, Bush had toured pubs with the KT Bush Band, but for the album she was persuaded to use established session musicians, some of whom she would retain even after she had brought her bandmates back on board.<ref name="lyricsystem.com">{{cite web  | title = Kate Bush Biography  | publisher = Lyricsystem.com | url = http://www.lyricsystem.com/kate-bush/  | accessdate = 2007-04-22 }}</ref> Paddy Bush was the only member of the KT Bush Band to play on ''The Kick Inside''. Unlike later albums where he would play more exotic instruments such as [[balalaika]] and [[didgeridoo]], here he played the more standard [[harmonica]] and [[mandolin]]. Stuart Elliot played some of the [[drums]] and would become her main [[Percussion instrument|percussionist]] on subsequent albums,<ref name="Lyricbooks">{{cite book  | title = Lyrics booklets from Kate Bush's albums  | publisher = EMI |  }}</ref> along with session drummer [[Charlie Morgan]], who later went on to work regularly with [[Elton John]]. [[Preston Heyman]] was credited with some subsequent studio work but mostly performed on Bush's live tour of 1979. 

EMI capitalised on Bush's appearance by promoting the album with a poster of her in a tight pink top that emphasised her breasts. In an interview with ''[[NME]]'' magazine in 1982, Bush criticised the marketing technique, stating, "People weren't even generally aware that I wrote my own songs or played the piano. The media just promoted me as a female body. It's like I've had to prove that I'm an artist in a female body."<ref name="rebel"/>

[[Image:Kate Bush Lionheart.jpg|thumb|left|Cover of 1978's ''[[Lionheart (album)|Lionheart]]'']]
In 1979, EMI persuaded Bush to quickly record a follow-up album, ''[[Lionheart (album)|Lionheart]]'', to take advantage of the success of ''The Kick Inside''. Bush has often expressed dissatisfaction with ''Lionheart'', feeling that she needed more time to get it right. The album was rushed out of the studio in [[Nice]] on the [[French Riviera]], making this her only album to be wholly recorded outside the UK. The album was produced by Andrew Powell, assisted by Bush. While it has its share of hits, most notably "Wow," it did not receive the same reception as her first album, reaching number six in the UK album charts.<ref name="WholeStory">{{cite book  | title = The Whole Story album lyrics booklet  | publisher = EMI | date=1986  |  }}</ref> 

The album takes its title from the track "Oh, England, My Lionheart," in which a pilot whose plane has been shot down contemplates his homeland as he hurtles to his death. It is a song that Bush has disparaged in later years<ref name="littlemiss">{{cite news  | title = Little Miss Can't Be Wrong  | publisher = Q magazine | date=December 1993 }}</ref> despite it being a firm favourite with many listeners. Literary references include [[J. M. Barrie]]'s ''[[Peter Pan]]'' in "In Search of Peter Pan" and ''[[Arsenic and Old Lace (play)|Arsenic and Old Lace]]'' in the song "Coffee Homeground," which was originally inspired by a peculiar taxi driver who drove Bush once.<ref name="lionpromo">{{cite news  | title = Lionheart Promo Cassette| publisher = EMI Canada  | date = 1978 }}</ref> Film references include "Hammer Horror," inspired by the [[Hammer Horror|Hammer Film studio]], known for their [[Gothic novel|gothic]] [[horror films]]. The song "Wow" references the British television show ''[[The Sweeney]]'', a popular police drama. 

''Lionheart'' is the first record on which her then-boyfriend Del Palmer worked as a bassist. Palmer went on to play bass or to engineer and record every album since.

Displeased with being rushed into making the second album, Bush subsequently increased her efforts to have control over work by setting up her own publishing company, Kate Bush Music, and her own management company, Novercia. The board of directors of these companies were herself and members of her family.<ref name="rebel"/>

Following the album's release, she was required by EMI to undertake heavy promotional work and an exhausting tour, the only one of her career.<ref>{{cite news|title=Stand By Your Mantra |publisher=Classic Rock magazine |date=2004}}</ref> Typical of her determination to have control, she was involved in every aspect of the show's production, choreography, set design, and staff recruitment.<ref name="rebel"/> During the "Tour of Life," Bush became the first ever singer to use a wireless headset radio microphone on stage,<ref>{{cite news| last=Badhorn|first=Philippe|title=Interview in Rolling Stone (France)|publisher=[[Rolling Stone]] |date=February 006 |}}</ref> which allowed her to incorporate extensive dance routines into her live shows. 

However, Bush disliked the exposure and the celebrity lifestyle associated with promotional work, feeling it was taking her away from her main priority of making music. A slow and steady withdrawal from public life began as she moved into producing her own work. It was at this stage of her career that she developed her perfectionist approach, which would see her ensconced in the studio for long periods, only facing the glare of the press when albums were released. A pattern formed with Bush disappearing for up to four years while honing new material. Her extended absences from the public eye would often lead the mainstream and music press to publish rumours concerning her health or appearance.<ref name="littlemiss"/> In the past, stories of weight gain or mental instability have been disproved by Bush's periodic reappearance.<ref>{{cite news|last=Ziegler|first=Mollie|title=The Return of a Sultry Songstress |publisher=The New York Sun|date=[[2005-11-08]] |}}</ref>

===1980<U+2013>1982===
[[Image:Kate Bush Never Forever.jpg|thumb|right|Cover of 1980's ''[[Never for Ever]]'']]
Released in September 1980, ''[[Never for Ever]]'' saw Bush's second foray into production, co-producing with Jon Kelly. Her first time as a producer was on her ''[[On Stage (EP)|Live On Stage]]'' [[Extended play|EP]], released after her tour the previous year.<ref name="h2g2"/> The first two albums had resulted in a definitive sound evident in every track, with orchestral arrangements supporting the live band sound. The range of styles on ''Never for Ever'' is much more diverse, veering from the straightforward rocker "The Wedding List" to the wistful waltz of hit single "[[Army Dreamers]]." ''Never for Ever'' was the first Kate Bush album to be composed on synthesizers and drum machines, in particular the [[Fairlight CMI]], to which she was introduced when providing backing vocals on [[Peter Gabriel]]'s third album in early 1980.<ref name="rebel"/>

''Never for Ever'' proved to be Bush's first record to reach the top position in the UK album charts, also making her the first female Briton ever to achieve that status.<ref name="MightyB"/>

Bush's literary and cinematic influences were present once more. "The Infant Kiss" was inspired by the 1961 film ''[[The Innocents (film)|The Innocents]]'', starring [[Deborah Kerr]] and [[Michael Redgrave]], which in turn had been inspired by [[Henry James]]'s novella ''[[The Turn of the Screw]]''. "The Wedding List" drew from [[Fran<U+00E7>ois Truffaut]]'s 1967 film ''[[The Bride Wore Black]]''. ''Never for Ever'' is, to date, the only album by Bush not to share a title with one of its own tracks. 

In November 1980, she released the Christmas single "December Will Be Magic Again," which reached number 29 in the UK charts. The song was not part of the ''Never for Ever'' album.

[[Image:Kate Bush The Dreaming Cover.jpg|thumb|left|Cover of 1982's ''[[The Dreaming (album)|The Dreaming]]'']]
September 1982 saw the release of ''[[The Dreaming (album)|The Dreaming]]'', the first album Bush produced totally by herself.<ref name="sing365.com"/> With her newfound freedom, she experimented with production techniques, creating an album that features a very diverse blend of musical styles and is known for its near-exhaustive usage of the [[Fairlight CMI]].

''The Dreaming'' received a mixed critical reception in the UK at first. Many were baffled by the dense soundscapes she had created, and some critics accused the album of being over-produced. In a 1993 interview with ''[[Q magazine|Q]]'' magazine, referring to ''The Dreaming'', Bush stated, "That was my 'She's gone mad' album."<ref name="rebel"/> Ironically, the album was hailed as a "masterpiece" and a "musical ''tour-de-force''" by critics in America, and the album became her first to enter the US charts, albeit only reaching number 157.<ref name="rebel"/> Despite singles from the album faring relatively badly in the UK charts, the album was a commercial success, peaking at number three in the UK album chart.<ref name="bbcalbums">{{cite web   | title = Kate Bush <U+2014> The Albums  | publisher = BBC | url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/h2g2/A21197171  | accessdate = 2007-04-22 }}</ref>

"[[Sat in Your Lap]]" was the first single from the album to be released. It predated the album by nearly a year and peaked at #11 in the UK. The following singles fared much worse. "[[The Dreaming (song)|The Dreaming]]," the album's title track featuring the talents of [[Rolf Harris]] and [[Percy Edwards]], stalled at number 48, while the third single, "[[There Goes a Tenner]]," failed to chart at all, despite promotion from EMI and Bush.

Bush was in her early twenties when making the album and tended to look outside her own personal experience for sources of inspiration. She drew on old crime films for the track "There Goes A Tenner," a documentary about the [[Vietnam war|war in Vietnam]] for "Pull Out The Pin," and the plight of [[Indigenous Australians]] for "The Dreaming." "Houdini" is about [[Harry Houdini|the magician]]'s death, and "Get Out Of My House" was inspired by [[Stanley Kubrick]]'s film of [[Stephen King]]'s novel ''[[The Shining (novel)|The Shining]]''. The album does contain a few introspective songs. The lead single, "Sat In Your Lap," examines feelings of self-doubt versus burning self-confidence and the search for a balance between the two. "Leave It Open" speaks of the need to acknowledge and express the darker sides of one's personality within the greater context of maintaining an open mind.<ref name="KBC12">{{cite news  | last = Bush  | first = Kate  | title = Kate's KBC article Issue 12  | publisher = KBC Newsletter  | date = October 1982 }}</ref>

===1983<U+2013>1987===
[[Image:Hounds of love.jpg|thumb|right|Cover of 1985's ''[[Hounds of Love]]'']]
Considered by many reviewers to be her masterpiece, 1985's ''[[Hounds of Love]]'' is no less experimental than previous albums from a production standpoint. Due to the high cost of hiring studio space for her previous album, she built a private studio near her home, where she could work at her own pace.<ref name="comeback">{{cite web|last = Ellen| first =Barbara| title = Comeback Kate|publisher =The Observer |  url = http://arts.guardian.co.uk/features/story/0,,1582789,00.html|date =[[2005-10-02]]| accessdate = 2007-04-04 }}</ref>

In August of 1985, the ''[[NME]]'' featured Bush in a "Where Are They Now" article. Two days later, on ''The [[Wogan]] Show'', the single "Running Up That Hill" was played for the first time. The single, and indeed the album, were showcases of a newfound talent for producing. ''Hounds of Love'' ultimately topped the charts in the UK, knocking Madonna's "Like A Virgin" from the number one position.<ref>{{cite book  | last = Fitzgeral Morris  | first = Peter  | title = Hounds of Love lyrics booklet  |publisher = EMI |  date=1997}}</ref>

The album is split into two sides. The first side, "Hounds of Love," contains five "accessible" pop songs, including the four singles "[[Running Up That Hill]]," "[[Cloudbusting]]," "Hounds of Love," and "The Big Sky." "Running Up That Hill" re-introduced Bush to American listeners and received considerable airplay at the time of its release. The second side of the album, "The Ninth Wave," takes its name from a poem by [[Alfred Tennyson, 1st Baron Tennyson|Tennyson]].<ref>{{cite news  | title = Kate Bush radio interview | publisher = Rock Over London with Paul Cooke  | date= 1985 }}</ref> Each of its tracks conveys the story of a woman who is lost at sea and facing death by drowning.

At the 1986 [[BRIT Awards]], the album earned her nominations for "Best Female Solo Artist," "Best Album," "Best Single," and "Best Producer"; however, she failed to win any of the awards. In the same year, Bush and [[Peter Gabriel]] had a UK top ten hit with "Don't Give Up," and EMI released her "greatest hits" album, ''[[The Whole Story]]'', for which she recorded the single "Experiment IV" and provided new vocals to "Wuthering Heights." This proved to be enough to win her "Best Female Solo Artist" at the 1987 BRIT Awards.

===1988<U+2013>1994===
[[Image:Kate Bush The Sensual World.jpg|thumb|left|Cover of 1989's ''[[The Sensual World]]'']]
The increasingly personal tone of her writing continued on 1989's ''[[The Sensual World]]'', with songs about unexpressed and unrequited love ("Love And Anger" and "Never Be Mine," respectively), the pressures on modern relationships ("Between A Man And A Woman"), and self-doubt ("The Fog"). "Deeper Understanding" portrays a lonely person who finds solace in the company of a computer. "Rocket's Tail," a dedication to her recently deceased cat Rocket, invokes the joys of indulging in another's fantasy. One of the quirkiest tracks on the album, touched by Bush's trademark [[black humour]], is "Heads We're Dancing," about a woman who dances all night with a charming stranger only to find out that he is [[Adolf Hitler]]. 

The title track drew its inspiration from [[James Joyce]]'s novel ''[[Ulysses (novel)|Ulysses]]''. Bush realised that the text from [[Molly Bloom's Soliloquy]] fitted the music she had created. When the Joyce estate refused to release the text, Bush wrote original lyrics that echo the original passage, as Molly steps from the pages of the book and revels in the real world.<ref name="Network">{{cite news  | last = Littlejohn | first = Maureen  | title = The Sensual Woman  | publisher = Network magazine  | date = March 1990 }}</ref> The song also alludes to [[William Blake]]'s poem "[[And did those feet in ancient time]]" with the line "And my arrows of desire rewrite the speech." 

The album contains extensive analogue [[overdub]]bing, as evidenced by a noticeable lack of clarity to the recording.<ref name="AbSoundSW">{{cite news  | title = Review of The Sensual World  | publisher = The Absolute Sound  | date = March 1990 }}</ref>  The songs "Deeper Understanding," "Never Be Mine," and "Rocket's Tail" all feature backing vocals by the Bulgarian vocal ensemble the [[Trio Bulgarka]]. ''The Sensual World'' went on to become her biggest-selling album in the U.S., receiving a Gold award four years after its release for 500,000 copies sold. In the United Kingdom album charts, it reached the number two position.<ref name="starpulse.com">{{cite web  | title = Kate Bush Biography  | publisher = Starpulse.com | url = http://www.starpulse.com/Music/Bush,_Kate/Biography/  | accessdate = 2007-04-22 }}</ref>

The song "This Woman's Work," from the movie ''[[She's Having a Baby]]'' (1988), was re-edited for this album. On [[November 27]], [[2005]], it was featured in the British TV drama ''Walk Away and I Stumble''. Due to that broadcast, the song reached the number eight position on the UK download chart.<ref name="download">{{cite web  | title = Official UK Download Chart Book  | publisher = DigitalStar.org.uk | url = http://www.distantstar.org.uk/DigitalDownloadChartBook.pdf |format = PDF  | accessdate = 2007-04-03 }}</ref> The song has also been used in a long-running UK television advert for the [[National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children]], broadcast in 2005-2006.

[[Image:Kate Bush The Red Shoes.jpg|thumb|right|Cover of 1993's ''[[The Red Shoes (album)|The Red Shoes]]'']]
''[[The Red Shoes (album)|The Red Shoes]]'' was released in November 1993. The album takes its title from [[The Red Shoes (film)|the film]] by [[Michael Powell (director)|Michael Powell]] and [[Emeric Pressburger]]; the story of the film, and the fairy tale by [[Hans Christian Andersen]] that inspired it, concerns a dancer, possessed by her art, who cannot shake off the eponymous shoes and find peace.<ref name="Toronto Sun">{{cite news  | last=Sakamoto |first=John |title = Kate Bush Weaves A Fairy Tale  | publisher = Toronto Sun| date = [[1993-12-15]] }}</ref> The album sold more than three million copies worldwide. 

The initial plan had been to take the songs out on the road, and so Bush deliberately aimed for a live band feel, with less of the studio trickery that had typified her last three albums and that would be difficult to recreate onstage.<ref name="Future">{{cite news  | title = Well red  | publisher = Future Music  |date= November 1993  }}</ref> The result alienated some of her fan base, who enjoyed the intricacy of her earlier compositions,<ref name="Orlando">{{cite news  | last = Gettelman | first = Parry | title = The Red Shoes review  | publisher = The Orlando Sentinel  | date=1993}}</ref> but others found a new complexity in the lyrics and the emotions they expressed.<ref name="request">{{cite news  | title = The Red Shoes review  | publisher = Request mgazine| date=November 1993 }}</ref> The stories and character pieces of her earlier work are replaced by a set of songs that are almost like a [[diary]]. This was a troubled time for Bush. She had suffered a series of bereavements, including the loss of her favoured guitarist [[Alan Murphy]], and, most painfully, her mother Hannah.<ref name="MightyB"/> Many of the people she lost are honoured in the ballad "Moments Of Pleasure," including [[Michael Powell (director)|Michael Powell]], with whom she had discussed working shortly before his death. Her long-term relationship with [[Del Palmer]] had also broken down, although the pair continued to work together.

Most notably, ''The Red Shoes'' features many more high-profile cameo appearances than her previous efforts. Composer and conductor [[Michael Kamen]] contributed a score for "Moments of Pleasure," which considerably heightened the impact of Bush's vocal and piano rendition. Comedian [[Lenny Henry]] provided guest vocals on "Why Should I Love You?", a track that also features significant contributions from [[Prince (musician)|Prince]]. "And So Is Love" features guitar work by [[Eric Clapton]]. [[Gary Brooker]] (from the band [[Procol Harum]]), [[Trevor Whittaker]], and [[Jeff Beck]] also donated their talents to the recording.<ref name="redlyrics">{{cite book  | title = The Red Shoes lyrics booklet | publisher = EMI  | date = 1993 }}</ref>

A film, ''[[The Line, the Cross & the Curve]]'', written and directed by Bush, and starring Bush and English actress [[Miranda Richardson]],<ref name="lineamazon">{{cite web  | title = The Line, The Cross & The Curve   | publisher = Amazon.co.uk | url = http://www.amazon.co.uk/Kate-Bush-Line-Cross-Curve/dp/B00003JA23/ref=sr_1_2/202-4934390-5379062?ie=UTF8&s=video&qid=1177361909&sr=1-2  | accessdate = 2007-04-23 }}</ref> was released the same year, featuring six of the songs on the album: "Rubberband Girl," "And So Is Love," "The Red Shoes," "Moments of Pleasure," "Eat The Music," and "Lily."

For the first time since "Wuthering Heights" in 1978, Bush released two different videos to accompany a single. The European video for "Rubberband Girl" was lifted from ''[[The Line, the Cross and the Curve]]'', while Bush recorded a separate video for the single's American release. The American video features her as a "rock-chick," with big hair, big sunglasses, a leather jacket, and wind machines, as she lobs around her microphone stand. The video is intercut with clips from ''[[The Line, the Cross and the Curve]]''. The album gave her her highest position to date in the US, reaching number 28 in the album charts. It reached number two in the UK.<ref name="softpedia.com">{{cite web  | title = Back On Stage After 12 Years  | publisher = Softpedia.com | url = http://news.softpedia.com/news/Kate-Bush-Back-On-Stage-After-12-Years-7653.shtml  | accessdate = 2007-04-23 }}</ref>

===1995<U+2013>present===
After the release of ''[[The Red Shoes (album)|The Red Shoes]]'' in 1993, Bush dropped out of the public eye for many years, although her name occasionally cropped up in the media, with rumours of a new album release. The press often viewed her as an eccentric recluse, sometimes drawing a comparison with [[Miss Havisham]] from [[Charles Dickens]]'s ''[[Great Expectations]]''.<ref name="GuardianProfile">{{cite news  | last = Barkham  | first = Patrick  | title = Guardian profile: Kate Bush  | publisher = The Guardian|  date=[[2005-09-28]]  }}</ref> In reality, she was trying to give her young son a normal childhood, away from the world of show business. In 1998, Bush gave birth to Albert, known as "Bertie," fathered by her guitarist and current partner Danny McIntosh.<ref name="MightyB"/> She did not release the news of his birth to the press, and it was over two years before the story broke. On the few occasions she has spoken to the press since, she has made it clear that motherhood has made her very happy. The couple and their son currently live in a <U+00A3>1.5 million home on an island on the [[Kennet and Avon canal]] in [[Berkshire]].<ref>{{cite web |title=<U+00A3>100K BILL FOR KATE|publisher=[[The Sunday Mirror]]|url= http://www.sundaymirror.co.uk/news/sunday/tm_method=full%26objectid=18238674%26siteid=98487-name_page.html|accessdate=2007-01-19|}}</ref>

[[Image:aerial sm.jpg|thumb|left|<small> Cover of [[2005]]'s ''[[Aerial (album)|Aerial]]''</small>]]
Bush's eighth studio album, ''[[Aerial (album)|Aerial]]'', was released on double CD and vinyl on November 7, 2005, in the UK, and November 8 in the U.S., following the release of the single "King of the Mountain" on October 24.<ref name="MightyB"/> The anticipation leading up to the album's release was immense, with press articles devoted to Bush being printed months before the album's release.<ref name="sequel">{{cite news| title = Kate Bush: The Sequel| publisher = The Independent|  date = [[2005-09-02]] }}</ref> The first single from the album was "[[King of the Mountain (song)|King of the Mountain]]." The song, which makes references to [[Elvis Presley]] and the film ''[[Citizen Kane]]'', is a contemplation on the excesses of fame. The track was played for the first time on [[BBC Radio 2]] on September 21, 2005, and was made available for download on September 27.<ref>{{cite news  | last = McKenna | first = Stephen| title = Kate Bush back on form with first single in 12 years| publisher = icscotland.com| date= [[2005-09-02]] }}</ref>

''Aerial'' is one of Bush's most critically acclaimed albums.<ref name="critics">{{cite web  | title = Aerial  | publisher = MetaCritic.com | | url = http://www.metacritic.com/music/artists/bushkate/aerial#critics | accessdate = 2007-04-03 }}</ref> Musically, the album is an ambitious and multi-layered work, incorporating elements of [[folk music|folk]], [[Renaissance music|Renaissance]], [[European classical music|classical]], [[reggae]], and [[samba]] into an adventurous pop style. 

As on 1985's ''[[Hounds of Love]]'', the double album is split into two sections. The first disc, subtitled ''A Sea of Honey'', features a set of unrelated themed songs, including the first single "[[King of the Mountain (single)|King of the Mountain]]"; "Bertie," a Renaissance-style ode to her son; and "Joanni," based on the story of [[St. Joan of Arc|Joan of Arc]]. In the song "<U+03C0>," Bush sings [[Pi|the number]] to its 137th decimal place, though for an unknown reason, she omits the 79th to 100th decimal places. The piano and vocal piece "A Coral Room," which deals with the loss of Bush's mother and the passage of time, was hailed by sections of the British media as "stunning" in its simplicity,<ref name="heat">{{cite news  | last =Hilton| first =Boyd| title = Aerial review  | publisher = Heat | date =[[2005-11-05]]  }}</ref> "profoundly moving,"<ref name="BThompson">{{cite news  | last =Thompson| first =Ben| title = Ben Thompson reviews an album of two halves  | publisher = Sunday Telegraph | date = [[2006-11-05]]  }}</ref> and the "one of the most beautiful" pieces Bush has ever recorded.<ref name="BThompson"/> The second disc, subtitled ''A Sky of Honey'', features thematically related songs linked by the presence of [[birdsong]]. The album's cover art, which seems to show a mountain range at sunset over a sea, is in fact a [[waveform]] that represents birdsong. All the pieces in this suite refer or allude to air or sky in their lyrical content. "A Sky of Honey" features [[Rolf Harris]] playing the didgeridoo on one track, as he did on the 1982 single "The Dreaming," and providing vocals on the track "The Painter's Link." Other artists guest appearing on the album include [[Peter Erskine]], [[Eberhard Weber]], [[Lol Creme]], and [[Procol Harum]]'s [[Gary Brooker]]. Two tracks feature string arrangements by the late [[Michael Kamen]], performed by the London Metropolitan Orchestra.<ref name="pi">{{cite news  | last =Thrills| first =Adrian| title = Is this great Kate <U+2014> or just Pi in the sky?  | publisher = Daily Mail |  date = [[2006-11-04]]  }}</ref>

On October 17, 2005, "King of the Mountain" entered the UK Downloads Chart at number six,<ref name="download"/> and by October 30, it became her third highest charting single ever in the UK, peaking at number four on the full chart. On November 13, 2005, ''Aerial'' entered the UK Albums Chart at number three, selling more than 90,000 copies in its first week of release. Within five months of its release, the album had sold more than 1.1 million copies worldwide. Bush herself carried out relatively little publicity for the album, only conducting a handful of magazine and radio interviews. ''Aerial'' earned Bush two nominations at the 2006 [[BRIT Awards]], for "Best British Female Solo Artist" and "Best British Album."<ref>{{cite web|title=Search results for Kate Bush|publisher=The BRIT Awards|url=http://brits.co.uk/search/?q=kate+bush|accessdate=2007-02-15|}}</ref>

In an interview with ''Weekend Australian'', published in December 2005, Bush stated that ''[[Aerial (album)|Aerial]]'' was not meant to be her last work and that she wished to continue writing and recording music. On March 13, 2006, EMI re-released all Bush's previous albums, including her greatest hits album ''The Whole Story'', on compact disc with cardboard cases made to look like the original vinyl prints. In 2006, viewers of BBC Two television's ''[[The Culture Show]]'' voted Bush one of the UK's top ten "Living Icons."<ref>{{cite web  | title = Attenborough beats singers for living icon award | publisher = InTheNews.co.uk | url = http://www.inthenews.co.uk/News/entertainment/tv/attenborough-beats-singers-living-icon-award-$1031507.htm  |  date=[[2006-12-17]] | accessdate = 2007-04-03 }}</ref>

==Musical style==
It has been difficult to define the musical genre of Bush's work because there are very few other artists like her. She is often compared to female singer/songwriters such as [[Joni Mitchell]] and [[Bj<U+00F6>rk]], but this comparison is derived from those artist's uniqueness rather than the similarity of their music. Her music has also been eclectic, utilising various styles of music even within the same album. Her songs have spanned across genres as diverse as [[Rock music|rock]], [[pop music|pop]], [[alternative music|alternative]], [[Indie (music)|indie]], [[Gothic rock|goth]], [[jazz]], [[folk music|folk]], [[ska]], [[samba]] and [[New Wave music|new wave]]. Even in her earliest works where the [[piano]] was a primary instrument, Bush wove together many diverse influences, melding [[European classical music|classical music]], [[rock and roll|rock]], and a wide range of ethnic and [[folk music|folk]] sources and this has continued throughout her career. 

In an interview with [[Melody Maker]] magazine in 1977, she revealed that male artists had more influence on her work than females, stating "Every female you see at a piano is either [[Lynsey De Paul]], [[Carole King]]. And most male music <U+2014> not all of it but the good stuff <U+2014> really lays it on you. It really puts you against the wall and that's what I like to do. I'd like my music to intrude. Not many females succeed with that".<ref name="rebel"/>

The experimental nature of her music has led it to be described as a later, more technological and more accessible manifestation of the British [[progressive rock]] movement that gave rise to the bands [[Genesis (band)|Genesis]], [[Yes (band)|Yes]], and [[Pink Floyd]].<ref name="bbcmprofile">{{cite web|title = Kate Bush Music Profile|publisher = BBC| url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/music/artist/m5vr/| accessdate = 2007-04-04 }}</ref> Like artists in the prog rock genre, Bush rejects the classical American style of making pop music adopted by most UK pop artists. Influenced by the vocal style of the singer [[Bryan Ferry]], Bush sings with an overtly English accent and her lyrics tend to be more unusual and less clich<U+00E9>d than those found American style pop lyrics.<ref name="Englishness">{{cite web|last =Moy | first =Ron| title = Kate Bush and mythologies of Englishness|publisher = Popular Musicology Online| url = http://www.popular-musicology-online.com/issues/02/moy-01.html| date =2006| accessdate = 2007-04-06 }}</ref> The musical instruments used in her songs and the way instruments are played commonly differs from the American norm.<ref name="Englishness"/> Bush's use of acoustic percussion textures throughout the years have been cited as the reason electronic drum machines became commonplace in popular recordings.<ref name="delkbc">{{cite news|last = Palmer| first =Del| title = A Soft Landing on the Sensual World|publisher =KBC Newsletter|  date =Fall 1989}}</ref>

More than one reviewer has used the term "[[surrealism|surreal]]" to describe much of her music. Many of her songs have a melodramatic emotional and musical surrealism that defies easy categorization.<ref name="hifi">{{cite news|last = Hudson| first =Sue| title = The Back Page|publisher =Hi-Fi and Record Review}}</ref> It has been observed that even the more joyous pieces are often tinged with traces of melancholy, and even the most sorrowful pieces have elements of vitality struggling against all that would oppress them.<ref name="spin">{{cite news|last = Davis| first =Erik| title = Red Shoes review|publisher =Spin magazine|  date =1993 }}</ref>

Bush is not afraid to tackle sensitive and taboo subjects.<ref name="bdreamer">{{cite news|last = Solanas| first =Jane| title = The Barmy Dreamer|publisher =New Musical Express| date =1983 }}</ref> "The Kick Inside" is about an [[incest]]uous pregnancy and a resulting [[suicide]], "Kashka From Baghdad" is a song about a [[homosexuality|gay male]] couple and "Breathing" explores the results of [[nuclear fallout]].  Her lyrics have referenced a wide array of subject matter, often relatively obscure, such as [[Wilhelm Reich]] in "Cloudbusting" and [[G. I. Gurdjieff]] in "Them Heavy People", while "Deeper Understanding" from ''The Sensual World'' portrays a person who stays indoors, talking to their computer to the point of obsession.

Comedy is also a big influence on her and is a significant component of her work. She has cited [[Woody Allen]],<ref name="realm">{{cite news|last =Brown  | first =Len| title = In the Realm of the Senses|publisher =New Musical Express|  date =[[1989-10-07]] }}</ref> ''[[Monty Python]]'', ''[[Fawlty Towers]]'' and ''[[The Young Ones]]''<ref name="littlemiss"/> as particular favourites. Horror movies are another interest of Bush's and have influenced the gothic nature of several of her songs. Such examples are her songs "Get Out Of My House", inspired by [[Stanley Kubrick]]'s ''[[The Shining]]'' and "[[Hounds of Love (song)|Hounds of Love]]" inspired by the 1957 horror movie ''Night Of The Demon''.<ref name="Qsleeve">{{cite news  | last =Sutcliffe| first =Phil| title = Hounds of Love Sleeve Notes  | publisher = Q magazine | date =June 1991 }}</ref> Her songs have occasionally combined comedy and horror to form dark humour, such as dancing with Hitler in the song "Head's We're Dancing" and the upbeat "The Wedding List", about the death of a couple on their wedding night.

==Live performances==
{{see|The Tour of Life}}
Bush's only tour took place in early 1979 ([[3 April]]<U+2013>[[13 May]]), after which she gave only the occasional live performance. Several reasons have been suggested why she abandoned touring, among them her reputed need to be in total control of the final product, which is incompatible with live stage performance, a rumour of a crippling [[fear of flying]],<ref name="Network"/> and the suggestion that the death of 21-year-old Bill Duffield severely affected her. Duffield, her lighting director, was killed in an accident during her [[2 April]] concert at Poole Arts Centre.<ref name="h2g2"/> Bush held a [[benefit concert]] on [[12 May]], with [[Peter Gabriel]] and [[Steve Harley]] at London's [[Hammersmith Apollo|Hammersmith Odeon]] for his family. Bill would be honoured in two later songs: "Blow Away" on ''Never for Ever'' and "Moments Of Pleasure" on ''The Red Shoes''. Bush explained in a [[BBC Radio 2]] interview with [[Mark Radcliffe]] that she actually enjoyed the tour, but was consumed with producing her subsequent records, being more involved with the recording process than most artists.

During the same period as her tour, she made numerous television appearances around the world, including ''[[Top of the Pops]]'' in the [[United Kingdom]], ''Bio's Bahnhof'' in [[Germany]] and ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' in the [[United States]] (with [[Paul Shaffer]] on piano).<ref name="smiles">{{cite news|last = Gambaccini | first =Paul| title = Kate Bush Smiles in Her New Red Shoes|publisher =New York Press|   date =[[1993-11-24]]}}</ref> 

In March 1987, Bush sang "Running Up That Hill" at [[The Secret Policeman's Balls|The Secret Policeman's Third Ball]], with David Gilmour on guitar. In January 2002, Bush appeared with David Gilmour singing "[[Comfortably Numb]]" at the [[Royal Festival Hall]] in London, England.

==Video projects==
Bush was one of the first musicians to utilise the burgeoning music video industry, creating videos for many of her singles, and even some album tracks that were not issued as singles. [[EMI]] has released a few collections of her videos, including ''Live at Hammersmith Odeon'', ''The Single File'', ''Hair of the Hound'', ''The Whole Story'', and ''The Sensual World''.

Bush appeared in many innovative music videos, designed to accompany her singles releases. Among the best known are those for "[[Running Up That Hill]]", "[[Babooshka (song)|Babooshka]]", "Breathing", "[[Wuthering Heights (song)|Wuthering Heights]]", "[[The Man With The Child In His Eyes]]", which was [[First music videos aired on MTV|the 55th video]] played on the first day of [[MTV]], and "[[Cloudbusting]]" featuring actor [[Donald Sutherland]], who made time during the filming of another project to take part in the video.<ref name="CBAK">{{cite news| title = Kate Bush radio interview|publisher =CBAK 4011 (Australia)| date =1985}}</ref>

In 1993, she directed and starred in the short film, ''[[The Line, the Cross & the Curve]]'', a musical co-starring [[Miranda Richardson]] featuring music from Bush's album ''The Red Shoes'' which was inspired by the classic movie [[The Red Shoes (film)|of the same name]]. It was released in 1994 to limited screenings. In recent interviews, Bush has said that she considers it a failure, and stated in 2001 "I'm very pleased with four minutes of it, but I'm very disappointed with the rest."<ref>{{cite web|title = The Big Sleep|publisher =Q magazine| url = http://www.katebushnews.com/2001.htm| date =2001| accessdate = 2007-04-04 }}</ref>

In 1994, Bush provided the music used in series of [[psychedelic]]-themed television commercials for the soft drink [[Fruitopia]] that appeared in the [[United States]]. The same company aired the ads in the [[United Kingdom]], but the British version featured [[Elizabeth Fraser]] of the [[Cocteau Twins]] instead of Bush.<ref name="Cocteau">{{cite web| title = Cocteau Twins Discography|publisher =CocteauTwins.org|| url = http://www.cocteautwins.org/~leesa/cocteautwins/cHTML/html/soundtracks.html |date= 2007-04-04 }}</ref>

As of March 2007, none of Kate Bush's music videos have been released to DVD in either North America or Europe, although several had been released on [[LaserDisc]]. By comparison, several video collections were released on [[VHS]], most notably ''The Single File'', which contained videos predating the ''Hounds of Love'' album, ''Hounds of Love'', containing videos concerning that album and ''The Whole Story'', a career video overview released with the late-1980s compilation album of the same title. In late 2006, a DVD documentary entitled ''Kate Bush Under Review'' was released by Sexy Intellectual, which included archival interviews with Bush, along with interviews with a selection  of music historians and journalists (including Phil Sutcliffe, [[Nigel Williamson]], and [[Morris Pert]]. The DVD also includes clips from several of Bush's music videos.<ref name="underreview">{{cite web| title = Kate Bush - Under Review|publisher =Amazon.com|url = http://www.amazon.com/Kate-Bush-Under-Review/dp/B000EXZHPQ/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1/002-1375359-6260068| accessdate = 2007-04-04 }}</ref>

==Movie projects==
In [[1990]], Bush starred in a comedy film called ''Les Dogs'', produced by ''[[The Comic Strip|Comic Strip]]'' for [[BBC television]]. Beginning in 1982 on the UK's [[Channel 4]], ''Comic Strip Presents'' offered a series of comedy films featuring comedians including [[Rik Mayall]], [[Dawn French]], [[Jennifer Saunders]], [[Adrian Edmondson]], [[Nigel Planer]] and [[Robbie Coltrane]]. The movies are usually written and produced by [[Peter Richardson]], who also usually stars. In ''Les Dogs'', which aired on [[8 March]], [[1990]], Bush plays the bride Angela at a wedding set in a post-apocalyptic version of Britain. While Bush's is a silent presence in a wedding dress throughout most of the film, she does have several lines of dialogue with Peter Richardson in two dream sequences. In another ''Comic Strip Presents'' film, ''GLC'', she produced the theme song "Ken" which includes a vocal performance by Bush. She also produced all the incidental music, which is synthesizer based.

In 1985, Bush contributed a darkly melancholic version of the [[Ary Barroso]] song, [[Aquarela do Brasil|"Brazil"]], to the soundtrack of the [[Terry Gilliam]] [[Brazil (film)|film]] of the same name. The track was scored and arranged by [[Michael Kamen]]. In 1986, she wrote and recorded "Be Kind To My Mistakes" for the [[Nicolas Roeg]] film, ''Castaway''. Subsequently, in 1990, a remixed version was included in an album of B-sides in her box set, "[[This Woman's Work]]". In 1988, the song, "This Woman's Work", featured in the [[John Hughes (film director)|John Hughes]] film, ''[[She's Having A Baby]]'', a year before a re-edited version appeared on Bush's album, ''[[The Sensual World]]''. 

In 1999, Bush wrote and recorded a song for the [[Disney]] film, ''Dinosaur'', but due to complications the track was ultimately not included on the soundtrack.  According to the Winter 1999 issue of ''HomeGround'', a Kate Bush [[fanzine]], it was scrapped when Disney asked Bush to rewrite the song and Bush refused.

==Impact==
===Collaborations===
A wide diversity of respected artists have worked with Bush on some of her more recent albums ranging from the rock guitarists [[Eric Clapton]], [[Jeff Beck]], [[David Gilmour]] and [[Ian Bairnson]], bassists [[Mick Karn]] and [[John Giblin]] (bass player for [[Elkie Brooks]]), jazz/rock drummer Stuart Elliot, jazz bassist [[Eberhard Weber]], violinist [[Nigel Kennedy]], classical guitarist [[John Williams (guitarist)|John Williams]], folk artists [[Trio Bulgarka|The Trio Bulgarka]], [[Gary Brooker]], [[Prince (musician)|Prince]] as well as numerous Irish traditional/folk musicians such as various members of [[Planxty]].

Bush provided vocals on two of [[Peter Gabriel]]'s albums, most notably on the hits "[[Games Without Frontiers]]" and the duet "[[Don't Give Up (Peter Gabriel and Kate Bush song)|Don't Give Up]]". He also appeared on her 1979 television special, where they sang a duet of [[Roy Harper]]'s "Another Day". Harper is another frequent collaborator, appearing on her song "[[Breathing]]" and she on his albums ''HQ'', ''Once'' and ''The Unknown Soldier''.

She provided backing vocals for the title track of the [[Big Country]] album ''[[The Seer (album)|The Seer]]'' in 1986. She has also sang on the [[Midge Ure]] song "Sister and Brother" from his 1988 album ''Answers to Nothing'', [[Go West (band)|Go West]]'s 1987 single "The King is Dead" and in 1996, the song "My Computer" from the [[Prince (musician)|Prince]] album ''[[Emancipation (album)|Emancipation]]''.

In 1987, she sang a verse on the charity single "[[Let It Be (song)|Let It Be]]" by [[Ferry Aid]]. She also sang a line on the charity single "Spirit of the Forest" by [[Spirit of the Forest]] in 1989.

The British dance act [[Utah Saints]] sampled a line from "[[Cloudbusting]]" for their 1992 hit single, "Something Good." In 2003, the song was sampled again by Ayla Presents Yel for their track "Sun is Coming Out."  "Night Scented Stock" was sampled by Loopzone in 1990 for their song, "Les Enfants Du Paradis."

In 1996, Bush contributed a version of "Mn<U+00E1> na h<U+00C9>ireann" ([[Irish language|Irish]] for Women of Ireland) for the Anglo-Irish folk-rock compilation project, ''Common Ground: The Voices of Modern Irish Music''. Bush had to sing the song in Irish, which she learned to do phonetically.<ref name="Mna">{{cite news| title = Mna Na h-Eireann|publisher =Hot Press| date =[[1996-05-29]] }}</ref>

===Inspiration for other artists===
In the 1980s and 1990s it became almost standard for individualistic female [[singer-songwriter]]s to be compared to Bush by the media. She has been noted as an influence on artists as diverse as [[Tori Amos]],<ref>{{cite web|last = Huey| first =Steve| title = Under the Pink review|publisher =All Music Guide| url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/h2g2/A3502568| accessdate = 2007-04-04 }}</ref> [[Antony and the Johnsons]],<ref>{{cite web| title = Music to his ears|publisher =The Guardian |  url = http://arts.guardian.co.uk/features/story/0,,1645991,00.html| date =[[2005-11-19]]|accessdate = 2007-04-04 }}</ref> [[Lily Allen]],<ref>{{cite web|title = Lily Allen|publisher =Upcoming.org|  url = http://upcoming.org/event/ext/ylocal/64385787| accessdate = 2007-04-04 }}</ref> [[Bj<U+00F6>rk]],<ref name="timeout">{{cite news| title = Interview with Bjork|publisher =Time Out magazine| date =[[1997-10-15]]  }}</ref> [[Coldplay]],<ref name="xy">{{cite web|last = Moayeri  | first =Lily| title = X&Y review|publisher =Miami New Times|  url = http://www.miaminewtimes.com/2005-06-09/music/coldplay/| date =[[2005-06-09]]|accessdate = 2007-04-04 }}</ref> [[Goldfrapp]],<ref name="dithering">{{cite news|last = Martin| first =Gavin| title = Dithering Heights|publisher =Daily Mirror| date =[[2005-09-29]] }}</ref> [[PJ Harvey]],<ref name="triplej">{{cite web|title = Kate Bush is Back |publisher =Triple J Music News| url = http://www.abc.net.au/triplej/musicnews/s1470979.htm| accessdate = 2007-04-04 }}</ref> [[Sarah McLachlan]],<ref name="roar">{{cite web|last = Collins| first =Tracy| title =On the Arts |publisher =PostGazette.com| url = http://www.postgazette.com/magazine/20000102onarts3.asp| date =[[2000-01-02]]| accessdate = 2007-04-04 }}</ref> [[Sin<U+00E9>ad O'Connor]]<ref name="roar"/> [[Bloc Party]],<ref>{{cite web| title = Archive|publisher =BlocParty.com | url = http://www.blocparty.com/history.php| accessdate = 2007-04-04 }}</ref> [[OutKast]],<ref name="triplej">{{cite web|title = Kate Bush is Back |publisher =Triple J Music News| | url = http://www.abc.net.au/triplej/musicnews/s1470979.htm| accessdate = 2007-04-04 }}</ref> [[K.T.

[[Paula Cole]], accepting the "Best New Artist" Grammy in 1996, named Bush as an influence. [[Ariel Pink]] wrote a tribute song for Kate titled "For Kate I Wait" on the album ''The Doldrums''. [[George Michael]] chose "[[Army Dreamers]]" for his celebrity playlist on the [[iTunes]] website. The [[trip hop|trip-hop]] artist, [[Tricky]], has said about Bush "I don't believe in God, but if I did, her music would be my bible".<ref name="MightyB"/> Even the iconoclastic [[punk rock]]er [[John Lydon]], better known as Johnny Rotten of the [[Sex Pistols]], has declared her work to be "fucking brilliant" and has labelled her "a true original."<ref>{{cite web  |  title = We Are Worthy| publisher = Q magazine | url = http://www.fodderstompf.com/ARCHIVES/INTERVIEWS/qawards2.html  |  date = November 2001|accessdate = 2007-04-03 }}</ref> [[Suede (band)|Suede]] front-man [[Brett Anderson]] has stated that "Wuthering Heights" was the first single he ever bought and mentioned "And Dream of Sheep" in Suede's song "These are the Sad Songs".<ref>{{cite web  | title = RISE TV programme| publisher = Channel 4 |  url = http://www.katebushnews.com/2002.htm  | date = [[2002-09-17]]|accessdate = 2007-04-03 }}</ref>
