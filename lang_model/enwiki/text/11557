The '''Seventeen Provinces''' was a term applied to the [[Imperial state]]s of the [[Habsburg Netherlands]] in the 15th and 16th century. They roughly covered the [[Low Countries]], i.e. the current [[Netherlands]], [[Belgium]], and [[Luxembourg]], plus most of the modern [[France|French]] [[Departments of France|department]] of [[Nord (department)|Nord]] including [[Artois]], [[French Flanders]], and [[French Hainaut]]. Also enclosed in this area were semi-independent fiefdoms, mainly ecclesiastical ones, such as [[Prince-Bishopric of Li<U+00E8>ge|Li<U+00E8>ge]], [[Cambrai]] and [[Principality of Stavelot-Malmedy|Stavelot-Malmedy]].

The Seventeen Provinces arose from the [[Burgundian Netherlands]], a number of fiefs held by the [[House of Valois-Burgundy]] and inherited by the [[House of Habsburg|Habsburg dynasty]] in 1482, from 1556 held by [[Habsburg Spain]]. Since 1512 the Provinces formed the major part of the [[Burgundian Circle]]. In 1581 the Seven United Provinces seceded to form the [[Dutch Republic]].

== Composition ==
After the Habsburg emperor [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]] had re-acquired the Duchy of [[Guelders]] from Duke [[William, Duke of J<U+00FC>lich-Cleves-Berg|William of J<U+00FC>lich-Cleves-Berg]] by the 1543 [[Italian War of 1542<U+2013>1546|Treaty of Venlo]], the Seventeen Provinces comprised:
[[File:Map-1477 Low Countries.png|thumb|280px|Map of the Low Countries in 1477]]
#the [[County of Artois]]
#the [[County of Flanders]], including the [[Burgrave|burgraviates]] of [[Lille]], [[Douai]], [[Orchies]], the [[Tournai and the Tournaisis|Lordship of Tournai and the Tournaisis]]
#the [[Lordship of Mechelen]]
#the [[County of Namur]]
#the [[County of Hainaut]]
#the [[County of Zeeland]]
#the [[County of Holland]]
#the [[Duchy of Brabant]], including the [[Margraviate of Antwerp]], the counties of [[Leuven]] and of [[Brussels]], and the advocacy of the Abbey of [[Nivelles]] and of [[Gembloux]]
#the [[Duchy of Limburg]] and the "Overmaas" lands of Brabant ([[Dalhem]], [[Valkenburg aan de Geul|Valkenburg]] and [[Herzogenrath]])
#the [[Duchy of Luxembourg]]
#the [[Lordship of Utrecht|Prince-Bishopric, later Lordship of Utrecht]]
#the [[Lordship of Frisia]]
#the [[Duchy of Guelders]]
#the [[Lordship of Groningen]] (including the [[Ommelanden]])
#the [[Lordship of Drenthe]], [[Lingen]], [[Wedde]], and [[Westerwolde]]
#the [[Lordship of Overijssel]]
#the [[County of Zutphen]]
It was not always the same ''Seventeen'' Provinces represented at the [[Estates-General of the Netherlands]]. Sometimes one delegation was included in another. 

In later years the County of Zutphen became a part of the [[Duchy of Guelders]], and the Duchy of Limburg was dependent on the Duchy of Brabant. The Lordship of Drenthe is sometimes considered as part of the [[Lordship of Overijssel]].  On the other hand the French-speaking cities of Flanders were sometimes recognised as a separate province.<br>
Therefore, in some lists Zutphen and Drenthe are replaced by 
*[[Burgrave|burgraviates]] of [[Lille]], [[Douai]], [[Orchies]] (also called [[Lilloise Flanders]])
*[[Tournai and the Tournaisis]]

There were a number of [[fiefdom]]s in the Low Countries that were not part of the Seventeen Provinces, mainly because they did not belong to the [[Burgundian Circle]] but to the [[Lower Rhenish-Westphalian Circle]].  The largest of these was the [[Prince-Bishopric of Li<U+00E8>ge]], the green area on the map, including the [[County of Horne]]. The ethnically and culturally Netherlandish duchies of [[Duchy of Cleves|Cleves]] and [[Duchy of J<U+00FC>lich|Julich]] did not join either. In the north, there were also a few smaller entities like the island of [[Ameland]] that would retain their own lords until the [[French Revolution]].

Historians came up with different variations of the list, but always with 17 members. This number could have been chosen because of its Christian connotation.<ref>http://www.leidenuniv.nl/en/researcharchive/index.php3-c=297.htm ''The Invention of the Dutchman: the Dynamics of Identity in the Low Countries, 1400-1600; international colloquium, 2007'' Leiden University</ref><ref>http://toastmastersd17.org/files/Properties-of-the-number-17.pdf</ref>{{Clarify|date=October 2009}}

==History==
{{History of the Low Countries}}
The Seventeen Provinces originated from the [[Burgundian Netherlands]].  The [[Duke of Burgundy|dukes of Burgundy]] systematically became the lord of different provinces.  [[Mary of Burgundy|Mary I of Valois, Duchess of Burgundy]] was the last of the [[House of Burgundy]].

When she married [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor|Maximilian I of Habsburg, Emperor of the Holy Roman Empire]], the provinces were acquired by the [[House of Habsburg]] in 1482, with the exception of the Duchy of Burgundy itself, which, with an appeal to [[Salic law]], had been reabsorbed into France upon the death of Mary's father, [[Charles the Bold]].  Maximilian's grandson, [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V of Habsburg, Emperor of the Holy Roman Empire and King of Spain]], eventually united all seventeen provinces under his rule, the last one being the [[Duchy of Guelders]], in 1543.

Most of these provinces were fiefs of the [[Holy Roman Empire]].  Two provinces, the County of Flanders and County of Artois, were originally French fiefs, but sovereignty was ceded to the Empire in the [[Treaty of Cambrai]] in 1529.

The [[Pragmatic Sanction of 1549]] determined that the Provinces should remain united in the future and inherited by the same monarch.  Therefore, Charles V introduced the title of ''Heer der Nederlanden'' ("Lord of the Netherlands").  Only he and his son could ever use this title.

After Charles V's abdication in 1555, his realms were divided between his son, [[Philip II of Spain|Philip II of Habsburg, King of Spain]], and his brother, [[Ferdinand I, Holy Roman Emperor]].  The Seventeen Provinces went to his son, the king of Spain.

Conflicts between Philip II and his Dutch subjects led to the [[Eighty Years' War]], which started in 1568.  The seven northern provinces gained their independence as a republic called the [[Dutch Republic|Seven United Provinces]].  They were:

#the Lordship of Groningen and of the Ommelanden
#the Lordship of Friesland
#the Lordship of Overijssel
#the Duchy of Guelders (except its [[Upper Guelders|upper quarter]]) and the County of Zutphen
#the Prince-Bishopric, later Lordship of Utrecht
#the County of Holland
#the County of Zeeland

The southern provinces, Flanders, Brabant, Namur, Hainaut, Luxembourg and the others, were restored to Spanish rule due to the military and political talent of the [[Alexander Farnese, Duke of Parma|Duke of Parma]], especially at the [[Siege of Antwerp (1584<U+2013>1585)|Siege of Antwerp (1584&ndash;1585)]]. Hence, these provinces became known as the '''Spanish Netherlands''' or [[Southern Netherlands]].

The northern Seven United Provinces kept parts of Limburg, Brabant, and Flanders during the [[Eighty Years' War]] (see [[Generality Lands]]), which ended with the [[Treaty of Westphalia]] in 1648.

Artois and parts of Flanders and Hainaut ([[French Flanders]] and [[French Hainaut]]) were ceded to [[France]] in the course of the 17th and 18th century.

==Economy==
By the mid-16th century, the Margraviate of Antwerp (Duchy of Brabant) had become the economic, political, and cultural center of the Netherlands after its capital had shifted from the nearby Lordship of Mechelen to the city of [[Brussels]].

[[Bruges]] (County of Flanders) had already lost its prominent position as economic powerhouse of northern Europe.  And Holland was gradually gaining importance in the 15th and 16th centuries.

However after the [[Dutch revolt|revolt]] of the seven [[Dutch Republic|northern provinces]] (1568), the [[Sack of Antwerp]] (1576), the [[Fall of Antwerp]] (1584-1585), and the resulting closure of the [[Scheldt]] river to navigation, a large number of people from the southern provinces emigrated north to the new republic. The center of prosperity moved from cities in the south such as [[Bruges]], [[Antwerp]], [[Ghent]], and [[Brussels]] to cities in the north, mostly Holland, including [[Amsterdam]], [[The Hague]], and [[Rotterdam]].

==Netherlands==
[[Image:Leo belgicus.png|thumb|[[Leo Belgicus]] map]]
To distinguish between the older and larger Low Countries of the Netherlands from the current country of the Netherlands, Dutch speakers usually drop the plural for the latter.  They speak of ''Nederland'' in singular for the current country and of ''de Nederlanden'' in plural for the integral domains of Charles V.

In other languages, this has not been adopted, though the larger area is sometimes known as the [[Low Countries]] in English.

The fact that the term ''Netherlands'' has such different historical meanings can sometimes lead to difficulties in expressing oneself correctly. For example, [[composer]]s from the 16th century are often said to belong to the ''[[Franco-Flemish School|Dutch School]]'' (''Nederlandse School''). Although they themselves would not have objected to that term at that time, today it may wrongly create the impression that they were from the current Netherlands. In fact, they were almost exclusively from current Belgium.

== Flanders ==
The same confusion exists around the word ''Flanders''. Historically, it applied to the County of Flanders. 
But when the Dutch-speaking population of Belgium sought more rights in the 19th century, the word ''Flanders'' was reused, but now to indicate the Dutch-speaking part of Belgium (see [[Flemish Movement]]).<br>
There is hardly any match between the territory of the County of Flanders and present-day Flanders.
*[[French Flanders]] belonged to the County of Flanders, but is today part of France.
*[[Zeelandic Flanders]] belonged to the County of Flanders, but is today part of the Netherlands.
*[[Tournai and the Tournaisis]] was some period considered as part of the County of Flanders, but is today part of Wallonia.

* The [[Flemish Brabant|present-day Belgian province of Flemish Brabant]] belongs to present-day Flanders, but was part of the [[Duchy of Brabant]].
* The [[Antwerp (province)|present-day Belgian province of Antwerp]] belongs to present-day Flanders, but was part of the [[Duchy of Brabant]].
* The [[Limburg (Belgium)|present-day Belgian province of Limburg]] belongs to present-day Flanders, but was part of the [[Prince-Bishopric of Li<U+00E8>ge]].

This explains for instance why the province of [[East Flanders]] is not situated in the east of present-day Flanders.
