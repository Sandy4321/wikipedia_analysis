'''Little Rebel''' was a cottonclad ram that had been converted from a Mississippi River steamer to serve as the flagship of the Confederate [[River Defense Fleet]] in the [[American Civil War]]. Sent from New Orleans to defend against the Federal descent of the Mississippi, she was among the force that engaged vessels of the [[Union Army]]'s [[Western Gunboat Flotilla]] at the [[Battle of Plum Point Bend]] on 10 May 1862. On 6 June, she again was involved in an action with the Federal gunboats, this time at the [[Battle of Memphis]]. In the battle, a shot from a Federal gun pierced her boiler, disabling her, and she was then pushed aground by the Federal ram [[USS Monarch|USS ''Monarch'']] and captured.

Subsequently repaired and taken into the [[Union Navy]], she served through the remainder of the war, seeing only limited action. After the war, she was deemed surplus by the Navy Department. Sold, she reentered the merchant service, where she remained until 1874.

==Confederate service==

''Little Rebel'' was built as ''R. E. and A. N. Watson'' at Belle Vernon, Pa., in 1859. She was acquired at New Orleans, La., by the [[Confederate Army]] in January 1862, and selected by Captain  James E. Montgomery, a Mississippi River boatman, to be part of his [[River Defense Fleet]]. On 25 January 1862, Montgomery began her conversion to a cottonclad ram by placing a 4-inch oak sheath with a 1-inch iron covering on her bow, and by installing double pine bulkheads filled with compressed cotton bales to protect her engines.<ref>ORA I, v. 10/1, pp. 38&ndash;39.</ref>

On 11 April Little Rebel's conversion was completed and she steamed from New Orleans to Fort Pillow, Tenn., where she operated in defense of the river approaches to Memphis, Tenn. On 10 May 1862, off Fort Pillow, Little Rebel, in company with seven other vessels under Captain Montgomery, attacked the ironclad gunboats of the Federal [[Western Gunboat Flotilla]]. The action of [[Battle of Plum Point Bend|Plum Point Bend]] was marked by successful ramming tactics by the Confederates, but ''Little Rebel'', under Captain J. White Fowler, serving as Montgomery's flagship, was unable to get into the battle except with her guns. Brigadier General [[M. Jeff Thompson]], CSA, who witnessed the battle said that ''Little Rebel'', under a shower of enemy missiles, "ran amid the storm as heedlessly as if charmed."<ref>ORN I, v. 23, p. 55.</ref> Meanwhile her guns supported Montgomery's other vessels which were ramming Union boats.<ref>Joiner, ''Mr. Lincoln's brown water navy,'' 63&ndash;67.</ref>

Later Montgomery's force held off the Federal rams and gunboats until  [[Fort Pillow]] was evacuated on 1 June. Then the Confederate vessels fell back on Memphis to take on coal. Following the Federal capture of Fort Pillow, Flag Officer [[Charles H. Davis]], USN, commanding the Western Flotilla, pressed on without delay and appeared off Memphis with a superior force on 6 June 1862. Montgomery, unable to retreat to [[Vicksburg, Mississippi|Vicksburg]] because of his shortage of fuel and unwilling to destroy his boats, determined to fight. In the ensuing [[Battle of Memphis]], ''Little Rebel'' attacked the ram [[USS Monarch|''Monarch'']], one of two vessels in the Union force under Colonel [[Charles Ellet, Jr.]], USA. The Confederate vessel was hit in her boilers by fire from [[USS Carondelet|USS ''Carondelet'']] and then was struck by ''Monarch'' and driven ashore by the blow. Her surviving crew fled to safety, abandoning  ''Little Rebel''.<ref>Tucker, ''Blue and gray navies,'' pp. 146&ndash;148.</ref>  

== Service in the Union Navy ==
The Union squadron captured the abandoned ''Little Rebel'' and sent her to [[Cairo, Illinois]], [[11 June]] for repairs and for adjudication before the Illinois [[Prize Court]]. Her seizure was judged to be legal, so she was purchased by the U.S. Navy from the prize court.  On  [[9 January]] [[1863]], she entered Federal service. She was first assigned to a flotilla of gunboats commanded by Lieutenant Commanding LeRoy Fitch, who had to suppress guerilla activity on the Ohio, Cumberland, and Tennessee Rivers.<ref>ORN I, v.  23, pp. 309&ndash;322.</ref> Her deep draft made her unsuitable for this duty, so she spent much time on guard duty in the vicinity of [[Cairo, Illinois|Cairo]].<ref>ORN I, v. 23, pp. 324, 386, etc.,</ref>
 
''Little Rebel'' patrolled from [[Red River (Mississippi watershed)|Red River]] to [[Fort Adams]] in March [[1863]], as Union ships captured [[Fort De Russey]] and moved to counter Maximilian<U+2019>s threat to [[Texas]]. Steaming to the Mississippi River in April, she patrolled this area for the remainder of the conflict. 

In May [[1865]], she and the other Union ships of the [[Mississippi River Squadron]] guarded to prevent the escape of [[Jefferson Davis]].<ref>ORN I, v. 27, p. 182.</ref> On the 28th, she convoyed troops to [[Red River (Mississippi watershed)|Red River]], remaining at the mouth of the river when the squadron was reduced in June. 

== Decommissioning, sale, and post-war civilian career ==

''Little Rebel'' decommissioned at [[Mound City, Illinois]], 24 July 1865<ref>ORN I, v. 27, p. 285</ref> and was sold there to Daniel Jacobs 29 November 1865.<ref>ORN II, v. 1, p. 128.</ref> Redocumented as ''Spy'' 4 March 1867, she remained in merchant service until 1874.
