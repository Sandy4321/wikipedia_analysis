'''Moses Cohen Henriques''' was a [[Netherlands|Dutch]] [[Jewish pirates|pirate]] of [[Spanish and Portuguese Jews|Portuguese]] [[Sephardic Jews in the Netherlands|Sephardic Jewish]] origin, operating in the [[Caribbean]].

Henriques helped [[Netherlands|Dutch]] naval officer and folk hero Admiral [[Piet Pieterszoon Hein]], of the [[Dutch West India Company]], capture the [[Spanish treasure fleet]] in the battle of the [[Matanzas Province|Bay of Matanzas]] in [[Cuba]], during the [[Eighty Years' War]], in 1628.

Part of the Spanish fleet in [[Venezuela]] had been warned because a Dutch cabin boy had lost his way on [[Blanquilla]] and was captured, betraying the plan, but the other half from [[Mexico]] continued its voyage, unaware of the threat. Sixteen Spanish ships were intercepted; one galleon was taken after a surprise encounter during the night, nine smaller merchants were talked into a surrender; two small ships were taken at sea fleeing, four fleeing [[galleon]]s were trapped on the Cuban coast in the Bay of Matanzas. After some musket volleys from Dutch [[sloop]]s their crews surrendered also and the Dutch captured 11,509,524 [[Dutch gulden|guilder]]s of booty in [[gold]], [[silver]], and other expensive trade goods, as [[indigo]] and [[cochineal]], without any bloodshed. The Dutch didn't take prisoners: they gave the Spanish crews ample supplies for a march to [[Havana]]. The treasure was the company's greatest victory in the Caribbean.

Henriques then went on to lead a [[History of the Jews in Brazil|Jewish contingent in Brazil]] during the [[Dutch Brazil|Dutch rule]], and established his own pirate island off the Brazilian coast. After the [[Portugal|Portuguese]] [[History_of_brazil#Beginning_of_Brazil|recapture of Northern Brazil in 1654]], Moses fled South America and ended up as an advisor to [[Henry Morgan]], the leading pirate of the time.
