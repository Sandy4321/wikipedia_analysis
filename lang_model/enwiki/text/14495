The '''Isaac Davis Trail''', also known as the '''Acton Trail''', is an historic {{convert|6|mi|km|adj=on}} trail running east-west in the towns of [[Acton, Massachusetts|Acton]] and [[Concord, Massachusetts]].  The trail was significant in 1775 when it was used by Captain [[Isaac Davis (soldier)|Isaac Davis]] and the Acton [[Minutemen]] to march on Concord during the [[battles of Lexington and Concord]].<ref name="issacdavis.org">{{cite web|url=http://www.isaacdavis.org|title=Isaac Davis Camporee|date=2009-01-07|work=Isaac Davis Camporee|publisher=Isaac Davis Camporee}}</ref> The trail was added to the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1972.<ref name="nris"/>

The trail begins at Isaac Davis' house (which still stands) in Acton, and ends at western end of the North Bridge in the [[Minuteman National Historical Park]] in Concord.  Most of the route is now paved roads, where in some cases the alignment no longer matches the exact route.  Despite this, the trail route evokes the time of the march, with its roadways lined with stone walls, and houses generally set back from the street.  The trail first runs northeast about {{convert|1.25|mi|km}} northeast, along Hayward Street, Musket Drive, Minuteman Road, Woodbury Lane, and Main Street.  It then turns more directly east for {{convert|1.5|mi|km}}, along a town-owned easement on private property, to Strawberry Hill Road.  It follows Strawberry Hill Road southerly for {{convert|1.75|mi|km}} to Barrett's Mill Road, which runs easterly {{convert|0.75|mi|km}} to meet Lowell Road in Concord.  It cross Lowell Road, following Barnes Hill Road and crossing Liberty Road to reach the Muster Field above the North Bridge.<ref name=NRHP>{{cite web|url=http://mhc-macris.net/Details.aspx?MhcId=CON.900|title=NRHP nomination for Isaac Davis Trail|publisher=Commonwealth of Massachusetts|accessdate=2014-05-03}}</ref>
