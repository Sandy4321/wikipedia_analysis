'''Friedrich M<U+00FC>ller''' (13 January 1749 <U+2013> 23 April 1825), [[Germany|German]] [[poet]], [[dramatist]] and [[Painting|painter]], is best known for his slightly sentimental prose [[idyll]]s on country 
life. Usually known as '''Maler M<U+00FC>ller''' (i.e. [[Painting|Painter]] M<U+00FC>ller).

== Early life and education ==
'''M<U+00FC>ller''' was born in [[Kreuznach]]. He showed a talent for art in his youth, and studied painting at [[Zweibr<U+00FC>cken]], where his fascinating personality and varied endowments won him the favor of court circles. In 1774-1775, he settled in [[Mannheim]], where he soon acquired a reputation as a poet. In 1777 he was appointed court painter. 

== Painting ==

In 1778 he was enabled by a public subscription to visit [[Italy]], which remained his home for the rest of his life. In 1780 he became a [[Roman Catholic]]. He was unfavourably influenced by the study of Italian models, and gradually became estranged from painting through failures and distress. He devoted himself instead to the study of the history of art. He became a sort of ambulant antiquary, and his services as [[cicerone]] were especially in demand among German visitors to [[Rome]].

== Literature ==
Before he left Mannheim he had tried his hand at [[literature]], under the influence of the [[Sturm und Drang]] movement. In 1775, he published several [[idyll]]s:  ''Satyr Mopsus'', ''Der Faun'', ''Bacchidon und Milon'', ''Der erschlagene Abel'' and ''Die Schafschur''. In form and content, these were closely modeled on the works of [[Solomon Gessner]].<ref>{{Cite-ADB|22|530|535|M<U+00FC>ller, Friedrich|Erich Schmidt|ADB:M<U+00FC>ller, Friedrich (Dichter)}}</ref> In 1778 came ''Adam's First Awaking and First Happy Nights'' (''Adams erstes Erwachen''; 2nd revised edition, 1779). A lyric drama of the same year, ''Niobe'' (1778), attracted little attention, but ''Faust's Leben dramatisiert'' (''Faust's Life Dramatized'') (1778) appealed to the turbulent spirit of the time, and [[Genevieve of Brabant|''Golo und Genoveva'']] (begun in 1776, but not published until 1801) was an excellent imitation of [[Goethe]]'s ''[[G<U+00F6>tz von Berlichingen]]''.

In his idylls, notably ''Die Schafschur'' and ''Das Nusskernen'' (1811), he struck out a more independent path. In these, emancipating himself from the artificiality of [[Solomon Gessner|Gessner]], he realistically reproduced scenes from the German peasant life of his day, not without a touch of [[satire]].  His later idylls took [[Johann Heinrich Voss|Voss]] as a model.

Maler M<U+00FC>ller's ''Werke'' appeared in 3 vols. (1811<U+2013>1825); in 1868 [[Hermann Theodor Hettner|H. Hettner]] published two volumes of ''Dichtungen von Maler M<U+00FC>ller'', which contain most of his writings. ''Gedichte von Maler Friedrich M<U+00FC>ller; eine Nachlese zu dessen Werken'' appeared in 1873, and his ''Fausts Leben'' was reprinted by B. Seuffert in 1881.

==Later years==
Through the patronage of the Crown Prince of Bavaria (afterwards [[Ludwig I of Bavaria|King Louis I]]), he was enabled to pass his declining years in comparative ease. He died in Rome in 1825.
