'''Edward Michael Stelmach''', [[Legislative Assembly of Alberta|MLA]], (born [[May 11]], [[1951]] in [[Lamont, Alberta]]) is the current [[Premier of Alberta|Premier]] of [[Alberta]], [[Canada]], having served in this capacity since December 14, 2006.  Born and raised on a farm near [[Lamont, Alberta|Lamont]], he entered provincial politics with the [[Alberta general election, 1993|1993 general election]], when he was elected to the [[Legislative Assembly of Alberta]] as the member for [[Vegreville-Viking]] (later [[Fort Saskatchewan-Vegreville]].  A [[Progressive Conservative Association of Alberta|Progressive Conservative]], he served in the [[List of Alberta provincial ministers|cabinets]] of [[Ralph Klein]] - at various times holding the portfolios of Intergovernmental Relations, Transportation, Infrastructure, and Agriculture, Food, and Rural Development - before winning the leadership of the Progressive Conservatives in the [[Alberta Progressive Conservative leadership election, 2006|2006 leadership race]], besting former provincial treasurer [[Jim Dinning]] in an upset win.

Stelmach's premiership has been heavily focussed on management of the province's [[petroleum|oil]] reserves, especially those of the [[Athabasca Oil Sands]].  He has rejected calls from environmentalists to slow the pace of development in the [[Fort McMurray]] area, and has similarly opposed calls for [[carbon tax]]es or other measures designed to discourage oil consumption.  Despite a series of controversies and poor relations with the traditional Progressive Conservative stronghold of [[Calgary]], his [[Alberta general election, 2008|first election as Premier]] saw him win 72 of the province's 83 seats, and increase of ten seats over what Klein had won in the [[Alberta general election, 2004|2004 election]].

==Background==

Ed Stelmach ({{pronEng|<U+02C8>st<U+025B>lm<U+00E6>k}})  was born May 11, 1951, and was raised near [[Lamont, Alberta|Lamont]], [[Alberta]], as the youngest of five children.<ref name="Bio">{{cite web |url=http://www.assembly.ab.ca/net/index.aspx?p=mla_bio&rnumber=55 |title=Stelmach's Legislature biography |accessdate=2008-01-21}}</ref>  He intended to pursue a career in law, and studied for a time at the [[University of Alberta]] before returning with his wife, Marie, to his family farm in 1973 after the death of his brother.<ref name="Bio"/>  He entered politics in 1987 with his election to the council of [[Lamont County, Alberta|Lamont County]]; one year later, he was appointed county reeve, a position he held until his entry into provincial politics in 1993.<ref name="Bio"/>

==MLA and minister==

Stelmach ran for the [[Legislative Assembly of Alberta]] as a [[Progressive Conservative Association of Alberta|Progressive Conservative]] in the [[Alberta general election, 1993|1993 provincial election]], defeating incumbent [[Alberta New Democratic Party|New Democrat]] [[Derek Fox]] in the riding of [[Vegreville-Viking]].  During his first term, Stelmach served as Deputy [[Parliamentary Whip|Whip]] and, later, Chief Government Whip for the P.C. caucus.  He also sat on the caucus's standing policy committees on Community Services and Health Restructuring.  During subsequent terms, he would serve on the standing policy committee on Agriculture and Rural Development and on the cabinet's Agenda and Priorities Committee.  As a [[backbencher]], he sponsored the ''Lloydminster Hospital Act Repeal Act''.  This was a government bill that dissolved the then-existing [[Lloydminster]] hospital board in preparation for a new arrangement compliant with both the Alberta government's new system of regional health authorities and the [[Saskatchewan]] government's system.  Lloydminster sits on the border of Alberta and Saskatchewan, and the hospital, although built and operated by the Alberta government, sits on the Saskatchewan side.<ref>{{cite hansard | url=http://www.assembly.ab.ca/ISYS/LADDAR_files%5Cdocs%5Chansards%5Chan%5Clegislature_23%5Csession_4%5C19960220_2000_01_han.pdf | house=[[Legislative Assembly of Alberta]] | date=February 20, 1996}}</ref>  It passed the legislature with little debate.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.assembly.ab.ca/pro/bills/s-bill96.htm |title=Bill Status Report - 23th Legislature 4th Session (1996) |accessdate=2008-06-16}}</ref>

Stelmach was re-elected by an increased margin during the [[Alberta general election, 1997|1997 election]], and entered Premier [[Ralph Klein]]'s cabinet shortly thereafter as the Minister of Agriculture, Food, and Rural Development.<ref>{{cite news |first=Christopher |last=Guly |title=Son of Ukrainian Canadian homesteaders becomes Alberta's agriculture minister|publisher=Ukrainian Weekly |date=April 27, 1997 |accessdate=2008-02-06 }}</ref>  He held this position until 1999, when he became Minister of Infrastructure.  While he held this portfolio, he aroused controversy by suggesting that the slow and fast lanes be reversed on provincial highways to save on maintenance; he quickly abandoned this proposal.<ref>[http://proquest.umi.com.ezproxy.lib.ucalgary.ca/pqdweb?did=212389841&sid=1&Fmt=3&clientId=12303&RQT=309&VName=PQD  Minister making a U-turn on flawed traffic proposal]</ref> In 2001, he became Minister of Transportation. 

Stelmach was re-elected by his largest majority yet during the [[Alberta general election, 2001|2001 election]], and retained the Transportation portfolio until 2004, when he was re-assigned to the position of Minister of Intergovernmental Relations.  He resigned this position in 2006 in order to contest the [[Alberta Progressive Conservative leadership election, 2006|P.C. leadership election]] (Klein had required that ministers intending to campaign to succeed him resign from cabinet).<ref>{{cite news |title=Alta. cabinet minister Stelmach quits position|url=http://www.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/story/CTVNews/20060321/stelmach_post_060321/20060321?hub=Canada |publisher=CTV.ca |date=March 21, 2006 |accessdate=2008-02-06 }}</ref>

==2006 leadership contest==

{{main|Alberta Progressive Conservative leadership election, 2006}}

Stelmach was the first candidate to declare his intentions, and picked up endorsements from nineteen members of his caucus (including cabinet ministers [[Pearl Calahasen]] and [[Iris Evans]]).<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.cbc.ca/canada/calgary/story/2006/11/28/tory-endorse.html |title=Artists for Dinning, MLA Pham for Morton |publisher=Canadian Broadcasting Corporation |date=November 29, 2006 |accessdate= 2008-04-15}}</ref>  However, former provincial Treasurer [[Jim Dinning]] had twice as many caucus endorsements (despite not having held elected office since 1997) and was generally considered the race's front-runner.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://thetyee.ca/Bigstory/2006/11/27/Alberta_leader/ |publisher-The Tyee |date=November 27, 2006 |title=Albertans Turf Five in Race for New Leader |accessdate=2008-06-16}}</ref><ref name="CTV">{{cite news |title=Opponents pledge support for Alta.'s Stelmach |url=http://www.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/story/CTVNews/20061202/alberta_tories_061203?s_name=&no_ads= |publisher=CTV.ca |date=December 3, 2006 |accessdate=2008-06-16}}</ref>  Stelmach ran a low-profile campaign, touring the province in a custom-painted campaign bus, while most media attention was focussed on the rivalry between Dinning and the more conservative [[Ted Morton]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.cbc.ca/canada/calgary/story/2006/12/02/steady-eddir.html |title=Steady Eddie made slow climb to lead Alberta Tories |date=December 3, 2006 |publisher=Canadian Broadcasting Corporation |accessdate=2008-06-16}}</ref>

According to the race's rules, the three candidates receiving the most votes on the first ballot would move on to a second ballot, which would use a [[preferential ballot|preferential]] voting system to select a winner.  Stelmach finished third on the first ballot with 15.3% of the vote, 3,329 votes ahead of fourth place [[Lyle Oberg]] and 10,647 votes behind second place Morton.  However, the fourth, fifth, and sixth place candidates (Oberg, [[Dave Hancock]], and [[Mark Norris (Canadian politician)|Mark Norris]]) all endorsed Stelmach for the second ballot.  On this ballot, he finished in first place on the first count, fewer than five hundred votes ahead of Dinning.  A majority of Morton's votes went to Stelmach on the second count, and he was elected leader.<ref name="CTV"/>

===Financing===

Stelmach raised more than $1.1 million for his leadership campaign.<ref name="donors">{{cite news |first=Joel |last=Kom |title=Stelmach criticized for donation secrecy |publisher=Calgary Herald |url=http://www.canada.com/calgaryherald/news/story.html?id=2c092641-5f4f-4dad-a9d3-21d364691b4a&k=22355 |date=February 28, 2007 |accessdate=2008-02-12 }}</ref>  After his victory, he revealed the names of the donors of 85% of this money, but declined to release the names of eighty supporters, citing their requests for privacy.

Stelmach was criticized again for organizing two $5,000 per plate dinners in January of 2007 to pay for his campaign debts, as well as those of Oberg, Hancock, and Norris.<ref>{{cite news |first=Jason |last=Fekete |title=For $5,000, Albertans can have exclusive chat with Stelmach |publisher=National Post |url=http://www.nationalpost.com/story.html?id=9b650e28-dcaf-43b9-9aab-90b8ea9664f7&k=62833 |date=January 11, 2007 |accessdate=2008-02-12 }}</ref>  After critics argued that the dinners were essentially selling access to the premier and two senior ministers, Stelmach cancelled the dinners.<ref>{{cite news |first=Darcy |last=Henton |title=Stelmach cancels $5,000 receptions |publisher=Edmonton Sun |url=http://www.edmontonsun.com/News/Alberta/2007/01/11/3300721.html |date=January 11, 2007 |accessdate=2008-02-12 }}</ref>

On February 4, 2008, immediately after [[Lieutenant Governor]] [[Norman Kwong]] read the [[throne speech]] to open the legislative session, Stelmach requested a dissolution of the legislature with [[Alberta general election, 2008|an election to follow March 3]].<ref>{{cite news |first=Dean |last=Bennett |title=Stelmach makes it official: Albertans will go to polls March 3 in general election |publisher=Maclean's magazine |url=http://www.macleans.ca/canada/wire/article.jsp?content=n0204157A |date=February 4, 2008 |accessdate=2008-02-12 }}</ref>  Shortly before the writ was dropped, a group calling itself Albertans for Change began to buy print and television ads criticizing Stelmach for a lack of plan and attacking him as unfit to lead the province.<ref>{{cite news |title=Attack ads take premier to task for 'lack of plan' |publisher=Canadian Broadcasting Corporation |url=http://www.cbc.ca/canada/edmonton/story/2008/01/16/attack-ads.html |date=January 16, 2008 |accessdate=2008-02-12 }}</ref>  The group was funded by the Alberta Building Trades Council and the [[Alberta Federation of Labour]], which led to a series of ads purchased by the [[National Citizens Coalition]] and Merit Contractors, in which it was criticized for "putting your <nowiki>[union members']</nowiki> money where <nowiki>[union leadership's]</nowiki> mouths are."<ref>{{cite news |first=Kevin |last=Crush |title=New attack ads aim at union's attack ads |publisher=Edmonton Sun |url=http://www.edmontonsun.com/News/Alberta/2008/01/24/pf-4792285.html |date=January 24, 2008 |accessdate=2008-02-12 }}</ref>

===Energy and environmental policy===

Much of Stelmach's term as Premier has been dominated by questions related to the [[Athabasca Oil Sands]].  The rapid development of these reserves was fuelling the Alberta economy's strong growth, but also raised environmental questions.  After winning the Premiership, Stelmach emphasized that he had no intention of taking measures that would slow down oilsands development and suggested that the economy would find its own appropriate growth rate.<ref name="UofA">{{cite news |title=Stelmach won't 'brake' oilsands growth |publisher=Edmonton Journal |date=December 5, 2006 |first=Archie |last=McLean}}</ref>  He aggressively defended Alberta's oil at home and abroad, and called the idea that it was extracted at an unacceptably high environmental cost "a myth".<ref>{{cite news |title=Stelmach fights <U+2018>dirty<U+2019> image of oilsands in Washington |publisher=National Post |first=Jason |last=Markusoff |date=January 16, 2008 |url=http://www.nationalpost.com/news/canada/story.html?id=242318 |accessdate=2008-06-12}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Stelmach defends oilsands in Washington |url=http://www.cbc.ca/canada/edmonton/story/2008/01/16/stelmach-washington.html |publisher=Canadian Broadcasting Corporation |date=January 16, 2008 |accessdate=2008-06-12}}</ref>  When [[Liberal Party of Canada]] leader [[St<U+00E9>phane Dion]] proposed a federal [[carbon tax]] to reduce emissions of [[greenhouse gases]], Stelmach rejected the policy on the basis that it would hurt the economy and would unfairly penalize the western provinces.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.canada.com/cityguides/kamloops/story.html?id=8080dbc6-543b-4be1-905e-7be4f63c357a |title=Carbon tax would hurt West: premiers |publisher=Calgary Herald |first=Jason |last=Fekete |date=May 29, 2008 |accessdate=2008-06-12}}</ref>  Instead, he has championed the development of [[carbon capture]] technology.<ref>{{cite news |title=Saskatchewan, Alberta leading the way in carbon capture, storage |publisher=Vancouver Sun |url=http://www.canada.com/vancouversun/news/story.html?id=78704a50-8dfd-4975-9c69-b79465f2a0c7 |date=May 30, 2008 |first=James |last=Wood |accessdate=2008-06-12}}</ref>

[[Image:Syncrude mildred lake plant.jpg|200 px|thumb|left|Stelmach has been a proponent of development of the [[Athabasca Oil Sands|oil sands]].]]
Though Stelmach pledged not to do anything to curb the development of the oilsands, he did promise to review royalty rates - the rates paid by oil companies for the privilege of extracting Alberta's oil.  He also committed to reducing the proportion of [[bitumen]] that left Alberta to be upgraded out of province, likening the export of bitumen to "scraping off the [[top soil]]" from farmland.<ref name="UofA"/>  Soon after becoming Premier, he commissioned the [[Alberta Royalty Review]] panel to make recommendations on the province's royalty regime; opposition politicians had accused the government of undercharging substantially.  Stelmach rejected many of the panel's recommendations, but did increase royalty rates by approximately 20% (25% less than recommended by the panel).<ref>{{cite news |title=Alberta increases royalties charged to energy companies|url=http://www.cbc.ca/canada/calgary/story/2007/10/25/stelmach-response.html |publisher=Canadian Broadcasting Corporation |date=October 25, 2007 |accessdate=2008-02-06 }}</ref>  Just after the [[Alberta general election, 2008|2008 election]], Stelmach's government announced a five year royalty break worth $237 million per year to encourage development that it feared would have become uneconomical under the new plan.<ref>{{cite news |first=Renata |last=D'Aliesio |title=Billion Dollar Royalty Break |publisher=Edmonton Journal |url=http://www.canada.com/edmontonjournal/news/story.html?id=915c98fb-eee0-4f90-9c0e-10eb94da7b11&k=78771 |date=April 11, 2008 |accessdate=2008-02-12 }}</ref>  He was less decisive in increasing in-province bitumen upgrading; in 2008 he conceded that Alberta would continue upgrading between sixty and sixty-five percent of the bitumen it produced for the foreseeable future, rather than the seventy-two percent target he had previously announced for 2016.<ref name="pipeline">{{cite news |title=Tory leader panned over pipeline |date=February 24, 2008 |publisher=Edmonton Journal |first=Jason |last=Fekete}}</ref>  This admission came in the wake of his government's approval of three new [[pipeline]]s designed to export bitumen.<ref name="pipeline"/>

In January 2008, Stelmach unveiled the province's "made in Alberta" - as distinct from imposed by the federal government or by international treaty - plan to cut carbon emissions in order to fight [[global warming]].  The plan called for reducing [[greenhouse gas]] emissions by 14% (from 2007 levels) by 2050.<ref>{{cite news |first=Jonathan |last=Fowlie |title=Alberta premier on defensive over climate change|url=http://www.nationalpost.com/news/canada/story.html?id=269848 |publisher=National Post |date=January 28, 2008 |accessdate=2008-02-08 }}</ref>  Environmental groups and opposition parties suggested that this was insufficient in light of [[British Columbia]]'s plan to to cut emissions by 80% (from 2007 levels) during the same period, but Stelmach argued that Alberta's position as a supplier of oil to the rest of the country justified relatively higher emissions.<ref>{{cite news |title=Stelmach says Albertans approve of climate plan |url=http://www.cbc.ca/canada/story/2008/01/28/federation-meeting.html?ref=rss |publisher=National Post |date=January 28, 2008 |accessdate=2008-02-08 }}</ref>  This was followed in June by the unveiling of the government's campaign to ask Albertans to make "one simple act" - such as [[composting]], using reusable shopping bags, and replacing [[incandescent light bulb]]s with the more efficient [[compact fluorescent lamp|fluorescent bulbs]].<ref>{{cite news |title=Going green shouldn't be hard: Stelmach |publisher=Edmonton Journal |url=http://www.canada.com/edmontonjournal/news/story.html?id=44db859b-dba3-4af6-9caa-1f37ea530f1c |date=June 11, 2008 |first=Alexandra |last=Zabjek |accessdate=2008-06-12}}</ref>  Critics argued that the emphasis on personal responsibility by individuals did nothing to address the greater environmental damage caused by the development of the [[Athabasca Oil Sands]].<ref>{{cite news |first=Graham |last=Thompson |publisher=Edmonton Journal |title=One Simple Act simple self-mockery |url=http://www.canada.com/edmontonjournal/news/opinion/story.html?id=ec05749e-04b8-4f2d-aa67-bf2bbc2a1c9a |date=June 11, 2008 |accessdate=2008-06-12}}</ref>

In June 2007, the government-mandated [[Alberta Energy and Utilities Board]] admitted that it had hired [[private investigators]] to spy on landowners who opposed the construction of a major power line in the [[Rimbey, Alberta|Rimbey]] area.<ref>{{cite news |first=Jim |last=Farrell |title='Heads must roll' Mason says |publisher=Edmonton Journal |url=http://www.canada.com/edmontonjournal/news/story.html?id=6cbdaa1e-ce15-4a60-b6ec-a8cb7d73b816 |date=August 17, 2007 |accessdate=2008-02-12 }}</ref>  Stelmach initially downplayed the incident, but ordered a judicial investigation once the province's Information and Privacy Commissioner initiated an investigation of his own.<ref>{{cite news |title=Alberta energy board's use of private eyes under investigation |publisher=Canadian Broadcasting Corporation |url=http://www.cbc.ca/canada/calgary/story/2007/06/26/eub-spying.html |date=June 26, 2007 |accessdate=2008-02-12 }}</ref>  This investigation found that the EUB had violated provincial law and infringed on the landowners' privacy, while the judicial investigation criticized the EUB's tactics as "repulsive".  The opposition parties called for the dismissal of the entire EUB and Energy Minister [[Mel Knight]]; Stelmach instead opted to appoint a new EUB chair.<ref>{{cite news |first=Geoffrey |last=Scotton |title=Calgary lawyer put on EUB death watch |publisher=Calgary Herald |url=http://www.canada.com/calgaryherald/news/calgarybusiness/story.html?id=bec54f74-61f5-48a7-a184-1f3cb2d99fb3&k=62699 |date=September 18, 2007 |accessdate=2008-02-12 }}</ref>

Stelmach's government also responded with legislation entitled the ''Alberta Utilities Commission Act'' (Bill 46), which would split the EUB into two parts: the Alberta Utilities Commission (responsible for regulating utilities) and the Energy Resources Conservation Board (responsible for regulating oil and gas).  The legislation was controversial, as elements of the EUB's governing legislation that provided for public notice and consultation in the event of energy construction projects were left out.  Opposition parties and advocacy groups charged that this was an assault on both landowners' rights and the environment.<ref>{{cite news |title=Environmentalists dressed as spies protest Bill 46 |publisher=Canadian Broadcasting Corporation |url=http://www.cbc.ca/canada/edmonton/story/2007/11/15/greenpeace-bill46.html?ref=rss |date=November 15, 2007 |accessdate=2008-02-12 }}</ref>  The legislation ultimately passed, and took effect at the beginning of 2008.<ref>{{cite news |title=Marathon legislative session breaks record |publisher=Canadian Broadcasting Corporation |url=http://www.cbc.ca/canada/edmonton/story/2007/12/05/bill46-passed.html |date=December 5, 2007 |accessdate=2008-02-12 }}</ref>

===Health policy===

Ed Stelmach's policy on health care has been highlighted by his removal the province's health care premiums effective the end of 2008.<ref>{{cite news |publisher=Canadian Broadcasting Corporation |url=http://www.cbc.ca/canada/edmonton/story/2008/04/22/budget-alta.html |title=Alberta budget to eliminate health-care premiums by 2009 |date=April 22, 2008 |accessdate=2008-06-12}}</ref>  Critics had denounced the premiums as being regressive, both because they were the same amount regardless of the payer's income and because people with better-paying jobs often had their premiums covered by their employer.  The opposition [[Alberta Liberal Party|Liberal]] and [[New Democratic Party of Alberta|New Democratic]] parties had long called for their removal.<ref name="premiums">{{cite news |url=http://www.canada.com/edmontonjournal/news/story.html?id=5d9ebfde-6d2b-465d-9aba-ebe543cb5ff5&k=91174 |publisher=Edmonton Journal |title=Stelmach gov't pledges to axe health-care premiums |date=February 4, 2008 |accessdate=2008-06-12}}</ref>  This elimination was announced in a [[throne speech]] immediately before the dissolution of the [[Legislative Assembly of Alberta|legislature]] for the [[Alberta general election, 2008|2008 election]], although it was initially promised to take effect by 2012.<ref name="premiums"/>  During this campaign, Stelmach promised to increase the capacity of Alberta universities to train doctors and nurses over four years, eventually resulting in the graduation of 225 more doctors, 350 more [[registered nurse]]s, and 220 [[licensed practical nurse]]s.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.cbc.ca/canada/albertavotes2008/story/2008/02/05/stelmach-doctors.html |title=Stelmach unveils plan to train more doctors and nurses |date=February 5, 2008 |accessdate=2008-06-12 |publisher=Canadian Broadcasting Corporation}}</ref>  After the registrar of the [[Alberta College of Physicians and Surgeons]] called the plan unfeasible, Health Minister [[Dave Hancock]] clarified that most of the increase would in fact come from the immigration of foreign doctors to Alberta, rather than from in-province training.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/story/CTVNews/20080205/stelmach_080205/20080206/ |publisher=CTV.ca |title=Alta campaign features promises, accusations |date=February 6, 2008 |accessdate=2008-06-12}}</ref>

Following the election, Stelmach's new Minister of Health, [[Ron Liepert]], released the government's new health plan.  In it, Liepert refused to characterize the problems in the health care system as being the result of doctor shortages, and instead promised structural reforms.  He indicated that these may include consolidating [[Health regions of Canada|health authorities]], closing rural hospitals, and de-listing some health services from being covered by the province's [[universal health care|public health insurance]] scheme.<ref>{{cite news |publisher=Canadian Broadcasting Corporation |title=Stelmach's Health Plan |url=http://cbc.ca/edmonton/media/video/newsatsix/20080417HEALTH_PLAN_realplayer_1.ram |date=April 16, 2008 |accessdate=2008-06-12}}</ref>  In May, the government took the first step in implementing these structural reforms by combining the province's nine health authorities into one health "superboard".<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.canada.com/edmontonjournal/news/story.html?id=4b0743f0-2046-4b13-8be7-7e2e4ca7e10d |publisher=Edmonton Journal |first=Jason |last=Markusoff |title=Tories create health superboard |date=May 16, 2008 |accessdate=2008-06-12}}</ref>

In June of 2008, three senior health officials announced that they would be leaving the province's employment at the expiration of their contracts in August.  Liepert blamed their departures on better offers from other employers, although New Democrat leader [[Brian Mason]] speculated that the government's health restructuring may have been to blame.<ref>{{cite news |first=CBC News |last= |title=Alberta loses 4 top public health doctors over salaries |publisher=CBCNews.ca |url=http://www.cbc.ca/health/story/2008/06/10/topdocs-leaving.html |date=June 10, 2008 |accessdate=2008-06-10 }}</ref>  Critics pointed out that the optics of allowing the employees to depart for more money elsewhere soon after the government had approved a substantial pay hike for cabinet ministers were not good.<ref>{{cite news |first=Canadian Press |last= |title=Alberta loses three senior physicians |publisher=The Calgary Sun |url=http://calsun.canoe.ca/News/Alberta/2008/06/11/5839746-sun.html |date=June 11, 2008 |accessdate=2008-06-11 }}</ref>

===Democratic reform===

[[Image:Day276alegislatureb.JPG|200 px|thumb|right|Stelmach returned all-party committees to the [[Legislative Assembly of Alberta]], where they had not existed since early in [[Ralph Klein]]'s tenure.]]

Klein's government had received criticism for reducing the importance of the legislature by sitting it fewer days than any other province's legislature and for directing business through standing policy committees of the Progressive Conservative caucus.  These committees met in private, unlike the legislature's all-party committees, which fell almost entirely out of use during the Klein years.  In April 2007, Stelmach initiated the creation of four new legislative "policy field committees" which would include opposition representation.<ref>{{cite news |first=Sheila |last=Pratt |title=Stelmach gov't takes first steps towards democratic reform|url=http://www.canada.com/edmontonjournal/news/opinion/story.html?id=070341d8-f23f-4061-ae7d-5ad8fed99826 |publisher=Edmonton Journal |date=May 6, 2007 |accessdate=2008-02-06 }}</ref>  The same month, his government introduced new legislation on [[conflicts of interest]], such that former cabinet ministers would have to wait one year before doing business with the government or lobbying it on behalf of third parties (up from six months).  It also created a similar cooling off period for senior bureaucrats, which lasted six months.<ref>{{cite news |publisher=[[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]] |url=http://www.cbc.ca/canada/calgary/story/2007/04/19/conflict-rules.html |title=Alberta to tighten conflict-of-interest rules for top bureaucrats, legislators |date=April 19, 2007 |accessdate=2008-06-10}}</ref>  However, an [[order in council]] passed by Stelmach's cabinet shortly before the [[Alberta general election, 2008|2008 election]] delayed the implementation of these rules until one month after the election, meaning that cabinet ministers who retired or lost their bids for re-election would be exempt from the new rules.<ref>{{cite news |first=Jason |last=Markusoff |title=Ex-MLAs, aides get a free ride out|url=http://www.canada.com/edmontonjournal/news/story.html?id=97b4a799-f7f7-4478-9fb3-3a105633e8d0 |publisher=Edmonton Journal |date=February 7,2008 |accessdate=2008-02-06 }}</ref>

===Teachers pension liability===

During his first year in office, Stelmach and his education minister [[Ron Liepert]] concluded a deal with the [[Alberta Teachers Association]] in which the province agreed to contribute $2.1 billion towards the $6.6 billion unfunded pension liability.  This liability resulted from insufficient contributions to the teachers' pension plan during the period leading up to 1992.  In exchange, the ATA agreed to a five year contract extension.  The deal was applauded by the opposition [[Alberta Liberal Party|Liberals]] and [[Alberta New Democratic Party|New Democrats]], but was criticized by the [[Canadian Taxpayers Federation]], which called for a plebiscite on the issue.<ref>{{cite news |title=Province offers teachers pension settlement |publisher=Canadian Broadcasting Corporation |url=http://www.cbc.ca/canada/edmonton/story/2007/11/15/teachers-pension.html |accessdate=2008-02-12 }}</ref>

===Relationship with Calgary===

Many [[Calgary|Calgarians]] have been critical of Stelmach, suggesting that, as a farmer from the central part of the province, he is biased against Calgary and urban Alberta in general.  They pointed to the fact that the city, which was considered the heartland of [[Jim Dinning]]'s support during the leadership race, had only three members ([[Ron Liepert]], [[Ron Stevens]], and [[Greg Melchin]]) in his first eighteen member cabinet (Stelmach supporters pointed out that [[Edmonton]] had only one minister - [[Dave Hancock]]).<ref>{{cite news |first=Jason |last=Markusoff |title=Stelmach defends cabinet choices |publisher=Edmonton Journal |url=http://www.canada.com/edmontonjournal/news/story.html?id=7d861094-ab76-457b-8301-a57c28f5c12f&k=0 |date=December 15, 2006 |accessdate=2008-02-12 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Stelmach names smaller cabinet |publisher=Canadian Broadcasting Corporation |url=http://www.cbc.ca/canada/calgary/story/2006/12/15/cabinet-stelmach.html |date=December 15, 2006 |accessdate=2008-02-12 }}</ref>  Stelmach also found himself in a feud with Calgary mayor [[Dave Bronconnier]] during his first year as premier as Bronconnier accused Stelmach of failing to keep a promise to the city regarding infrastructure spending during his first budget.<ref name="monolith">{{cite news |first=Nicholas |last=Kohler |title=Cracks in the Tory monolith |publisher=Maclean's magazine |url=http://www.macleans.ca/article.jsp?content=20070521_105232_105232&source=srch |date=May 21, 2007 |accessdate=2008-02-12 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |first=Dawn |last=Walton |title=Calgary poised to go Liberal, party leader says |publisher=Globe and Mail |url=http://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/RTGAM.20080209.walberta09/BNStory/National/home |date=February 9, 2008 |accessdate=2008-02-12 }}</ref>  Several Stelmach supporters suggested that the mayor, a [[Alberta Liberal Party|Liberal]], might be angling to take over as leader of the official opposition if [[Kevin Taft]] fumbled.<ref name="monolith"/>  During the by-election to fill [[Ralph Klein]]'s [[Calgary Elbow]] seat, P.C. candidate Brian Heninger went to far as to tell a voter he'd like to choke his party's leader (Stelmach told media that this was exactly the sort of enthusiasm he wanted from his M.L.A.s).<ref>{{cite news |first=CP |last= |title=Disgruntled Voters in Alberta |publisher=Edmonton Sun |url= http://www.edmontonsun.com/News/Alberta/2007/06/10/4250096.html

===Domain name controversy===

In December 2007, Stelmach threatened legal action against blogger and former [[Alberta Liberal Party|Liberal]] staffer Dave Cournoyer for misappropriating Stelmach's persona by registering the domain name edstelmach.ca; Cournoyer had registered the domain for $14 in April 2007, four months after Stelmach became premier, and had directed it to the [[Wikipedia]] article on [[Harry Strom]].<ref>{{cite news |title=Alberta premier threatens to sue over domain name |publisher=Canadian Broadcasting Corporation |url=http://www.cbc.ca/canada/edmonton/story/2008/01/08/stelmach-website.html |date=January 8, 2008 |accessdate=2008-02-12 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=A name is his domain, says Alberta premier |publisher=Canadian Broadcasting Corporation |url=http://www.cbc.ca/canada/calgary/story/2008/01/10/stelmach-domain.html |date=January 10, 2008 |accessdate=2008-02-12 }}</ref>  After this manoeuvre was met with mixed media and public reaction, Stelmach backed off threats of legal action and turned to negotiation in an effort to acquire the domain name. As of February 2008, no resolution had been reached.

===Pay increases===

Shortly after winning an increased majority in the [[Alberta general election, 2008|2008 election]], Stelmach's cabinet approved substantial raises for themselves, increasing the salary paid to cabinet ministers from $142,000 to $184,000 and that paid to the Premier from $159,450 to $213,450.  The increases also affect the [[severance]] paid to ministers who resign or are defeated in elections - under the program implemented by [[Ralph Klein]]'s government to replace the previously-existing [[pension]] program, departing MLAs receive three months pay for every year they served, with the level of the pay based on their three highest-earning years.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.cbc.ca/canada/edmonton/story/2008/06/05/mla-severance.html |title=Premier, Speaker in line for $1M payouts |publisher=Canadian Broadcasting Corporation |date=June 5, 2008 |accessdate=2008-06-16}}</ref>  The increases were attacked by the [[Canadian Taxpayers Federation]] and the opposition parties, but Stelmach defended the raises as the first received by cabinet ministers in fifteen years and as being necessary to attract qualified people to politics.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.cbc.ca/canada/edmonton/story/2008/06/02/edm-stelmach-pay.html?ref=rss |title=Stelmach unrepentant over hefty cabinet pay hikes |publisher=Canadian Broadcasting Corporation |date=June 2, 2008 |accessdate=2008-06-16}}</ref>
