The '''Ayyubid''' or '''Ayyoubid Dynasty''' was a [[Muslim]] dynasty of [[Kurds|Kurdish]]<ref>[http://www.bartleby.com/65/sa/Saladin.html Saladin. The Columbia Encyclopedia, Sixth Edition]</ref> origins which ruled [[Egypt]], [[Syria]], [[Yemen]] (except for the Northern Mountains), [[Diyar Bakr]], [[Mecca]], [[Hejaz]] and northern [[Iraq]] in the 12th and 13th centuries. The Ayyubids are also known as '''Ayoubites''', '''Ayyoubites''', '''Ayoubides''' or '''Ayyoubides'''.

The Ayyubid Dynasty was founded by [[Saladin]] (Salah ah-Din), who, with his uncle [[Shirkuh]], conquered Egypt for the [[Zengid Dynasty|Zengid]] King [[Nur ad-Din]] of [[Damascus]] in [[1169]]. The name comes from Saladin's father and Shirkuh's brother, [[Najm ad-Din Ayyub]]. In [[1171]], Saladin deposed the last [[Fatimid]] Caliph, but he gradually became estranged from his former master.  When Nur ed-Din died in [[1174]], Saladin declared war against Nur ed-Din's young son, [[As-Salih Ismail al-Malik|As-Salih Ismail]], and seized Damascus.  Ismail fled to [[Aleppo]], where he continued to resist Saladin until his murder in [[1181]].  After this, Saladin seized control of the interior of the entirety of Syria, and even conquered the Jezireh in Northern Iraq.  His greatest accomplishment, though, was his defeat of the [[Crusader states]] at the [[Battle of Hattin]] and conquest of [[Jerusalem]] in [[1187]].  Saladin died in [[1193]], shortly after signing a treaty with [[Richard I of England]] which restored a coastal strip from Ascalon to Antioch to Crusader control.

Following Saladin's death, his sons fell to squabbling over the division of the Empire, until in 1200 Saladin's brother, [[Al-Adil]], succeeded in securing control over the whole empire.  The same process repeated at Al-Adil's death in [[1218]], and at his son [[Al-Kamil|Al-Kamil's]] death in 1238, but the Ayyubid state as a whole remained fairly strong.  In [[1250]] Turanshah, the last Ayyubid Sultan of Egypt, was murdered and replaced by his [[Mamluk]] slave-general [[Aibek]], who founded the [[Bahri dynasty]].

The Ayyubids retreated soon after the loss of Egypt. Pockets of resistance against the Mamelukes lingered on in [[Syria]] (based from 1271 in the city of Hamah) for another 80 years, until the latter finally absorbed them in [[1334]].
