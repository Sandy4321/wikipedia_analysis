Amy Rose was created by [[Kazuyuki Hoshino]] ''(Sonic Team USA Art Director)''. She is a pink, [[female]], [[anthropomorphism|anthropomorphic]], [[humanoid]] [[hedgehog]] who plays the part of [[Sonic the Hedgehog (character)|Sonic]]'s self-proclaimed [[Romantic interest|girlfriend]]. She has chased Sonic since her first debut in [[1993]], and has been trying to win his heart in everything from the series' animated TV shows to comics and games. She is the first female character introduced into the game universe and is also one of the most popular, coming in fifth place on an official popularity poll.<ref name="poll">{{cite web |author=Sonic Team

Like [[Sonic the Hedgehog (character)|Sonic]] and [[List of characters from Sonic the Hedgehog|other characters in the series]], Amy is significantly shorter and lighter than [[humans]] her same age. To be precise, she is 12 years old, 90cm (2ft 11in) tall, and keeps her weight a secret (much like the other female characters).<!--Original research regarding Amy's weight based on what her "proportions" suggest is not valid. Please stick to what is officially stated.--><ref name="Amy's Sonic Channel profile">{{cite web |author=Sonic Team  |publisher = Sega of Japan |url=http://sonic.sega.jp/chara/amyrose/ |title=Amy Rose's official character profile |accessdate=2007-09-24}}</ref> She was described as being 8 years old in ''[[Sonic CD]]'', but as of ''[[Sonic Adventure]]'' and onwards she has grown older (by 4 years). Also, with the addition of [[Cream the Rabbit]], Amy seems to have found herself a [[sidekick]] similar to Sonic's own [[Miles "Tails" Prower|Tails]] (as implied by ''[[Sonic Battle]]'', ''[[Sonic Heroes]]'', ''[[Sonic Advance 3]]'', '' and [[Shadow the Hedgehog (Video Game)|Shadow the Hedgehog]]''). Her clothes are a red dress with a white stripe at the hem of her dress, a red hairclip/headband, 2 golden ring-like wristbands/bracelets and red go-go boots with white stripes going down the center. 

==History==
===Games===
Despite her frequent use in Sega games (especially since the Dreamcast era), Amy was not actually created by [[Sonic Team]]. A prototype version of her appeared in the [[Sonic the Hedgehog (manga)|''Sonic the Hedgehog'' manga]] published on September 23, 1992, and there she was literally "the girlfriend of Nikki (Sonic)", as the description translates. After that appearance, [[Sega]] took the character, and [[Kazuyuki Hoshino]] redesigned her for ''[[Sonic CD]]'' in 1993. It is said that she is always wearing a red dress and [[Converse]]-like running shoes.{{Fact|date=April 2008}}

In her first game appearance, ''[[Sonic CD]]'' (1993), Amy was introduced and kidnapped by [[Metal Sonic]]. [[Doctor Robotnik]] then used the time stones to set time back on the Little Planet. She had the nickname "Rosy the Rascal" at this point, and was named "[[Princess Sally]]"{{Fact|date=April 2008}} in the Western manuals to tie in with the [[Sonic the Hedgehog (TV series)|cartoon]], though all later games called her Amy. Being a Genesis-era game (though technically a Sega CD game), Sonic CD's plot was minimal. Amy's only personality trait was that she was a big fan of Sonic, and no real reason was given for her kidnapping besides as bait for Sonic. Though Sonic CD was released after ''[[Sonic the Hedgehog 2]]'', it was in production at the same time, meaning that Amy has more or less been around as long as [[Miles "Tails" Prower|Tails]].

Amy's first use of the Piko Piko Hammer was in ''[[Sonic the Fighters]]''. This game used her "Rosy the Rascal" nickname as well, though it has not been seen since.

In 1998, ''[[Sonic Adventure]]'' thrust Amy in the spotlight. She is a playable character in the game and uses her weapon of choice, the Piko Piko Hammer, to defend herself during her quest to find the family of a bird that escaped Eggman and crashed into her. Like the other major characters in the series, Amy was redesigned significantly for this game. Her quills were redesigned into short hair being slacked down, and she now wore a red dress and red boots with a white stripe from the top to the tip to take advantage of her more mature 12-year-old form. She was given green eyes, the same eye color as Sonic had only in a lighter value. <!-- Unofficial versions do not belong on this page. This has since been moved to the Archie series.
No official explanation was given for Amy's age change, but in the [[Sonic the Hedgehog (Archie Comics)|Archie Sonic comic books]], she made a wish on Sonic's 1,000,000,000th Ring to become older. --> Somewhat oddly, in this newer design, Amy often appears to have a more of an 'hourglass'-shape to her body than many other females in the series (such as Blaze, Wave and Marine), despite the fact that she is canonically of a younger age than many of these characters. 

She was an important supporting character in ''[[Sonic Adventure 2]]'' because she had some of the most prominent roles and was playable in 2-player mode. When Sonic was kept in an island prison, with Tails' help she managed to free him. This happened to be one of the surprisingly many times Amy has saved Sonic rather than the usual opposite.

Amy was playable in ''[[Sonic Advance]]'', but unlike the other playable characters, she could not spin and all her attacks had to be triggered. 

In ''[[Sonic Heroes]]'', Amy leads Team Rose. She represents the team's speed formation. (Like Sonic or Shadow in teams Sonic and Dark) she's accompanied by [[Cream the Rabbit]] and [[Big the Cat]] on a mission to impress Sonic, while Big wants to find his friend Froggy (again), and Cream and [[Cream the Rabbit#Cheese the Chao|Cheese]] want to find Cheese's sibling, Chocola, all the while inspiring the whole team, cheering her friends on.

Amy has appeared alongside Sonic and the rest of the cast in ''[[Shadow the Hedgehog (game)|Shadow the Hedgehog]]'', ''[[Sonic the Hedgehog (2006)|Sonic the Hedgehog]]'', ''[[Sonic Riders]]'', ''[[Sonic and the Secret Rings]]'', and so on through the newer games.  Her outfits have changed for certain games, such as the one she wears for ''Sonic Riders''. She also appears in [[Sonic Chronicles: The Dark Brotherhood]], in which she has apparently given up her pursuit of Sonic and started a relationship with a new character named [[List of characters from Sonic the Hedgehog (games)#Dexter|Dexter]]<ref>[http://cache.kotaku.com/assets/images/gallery/9/2008/04/medium_2406319167_0361561b78_o.jpg Dexter pic]</ref>.

===Sonic X===
Amy was also one of the main characters in ''[[Sonic X]]'', an [[anime]] series which is the most recent of the [[Sonic the Hedgehog (character)|Sonic the Hedgehog]] TV shows; her first ever appearance in a Sonic TV series.

In ''Sonic X'', Amy is Sonic's fan, friend, and love interest, although Sonic does not often return her feelings. As with her game appearances, her long-term goal is to get him to notice her. She gets mad at Sonic's impatience and aloof attitude, which occasionally are so bad that she is driven to violence. However, she really does care about him.
Her personality in the anime is similar to her personality in [[Sonic Adventure]].

===''Sonic the Hedgehog'' (comics)===
In the ''[[Sonic the Hedgehog (comics)]]'' Amy was the same age as depicted in the original games. In a flashback it was shown Amy tried to become a part of the Freedom Fighters but was denied by Sally Acorn. Amy accused Sally of the reason so she `won't get closer to Sonic` however the true reason was that Amy was far too young at the time (as she was only 8 years old) and did not have the experience like Tails had. However, during the [[Sonic Adventure]] Adaptation she makes a wish on the [[Ring of Acorns]], which caused her to grow physically older, reaching the age of 12, while maintaining her childish mindset and making her appear to be something of a ditz. After this Amy once again requested to join the Freedom Fighters, but was denied again by Sonic, who told her having an older body is not enough she still had the mentality of an 8-year old and still had no fighting experience. A year later when Sonic returned to Mobius, Amy was awarded a medal and became a Freedom Fighter by Sally, who thanked her for her service to help the Freedom Fighters; Amy was overwhelmed by happiness that one of her wishes came true.

Amy is the cousin of [[Minor Freedom Fighters #Rob O' the Hedge|Rob O' the Hedge]] (a thinly veiled homage to [[Robin Hood]]), who sends her to live in Knothole as things get tough in their homeland of Mercia. Echoing her introduction in ''[[Sonic CD]]'', she was captured by [[Metal Sonic]] but saved by [[Sonic the Hedgehog (Archie character)|Sonic the Hedgehog]] in the landmark issue #25. She fell head over heels for Sonic, but remained distant out of respect for [[Sally Acorn]]. After Sonic and Sally's breakup in issue #138, Amy has begun to show her love for the hedgehog once again.

Amy undergoes combat training with the former Dark Legion soldier Julie-Su. When Julie explains that Amy should want this training to better herself rather than to impress Sonic, Amy replies that she does want to better herself - so that no one else will be more worthy of Sonic's affection than she. While not the first to discover it, Amy was the first to oust Fiona Fox for cheating on Sonic with Scourge, enraged that anyone would play with Sonic's emotions so cruelly. She serves as the flower girl at Antoine and Bunnie's wedding and, not long after, is one of the few to avoid capture during the destruction of Knothole (the others being Sonic, Knuckles, Tails and NICOLE). While initially distraught, she immediately takes part in the rescue mission; with her hammer, she and Knuckles destroy the Egg Grapes and free several captives. After the escape she is shown supporting Rotor, whose back was injured during the initial attack. She now lives in New Mobotropolis.

===''Sonic the Comic''===
In the UK publication ''[[Sonic the Comic]]'', Amy first appeared in a two-part story where she was 'arrested' by Dr. Robotnik's Trooper [[Badniks]] for the criminal offence of association with Sonic (she had been saying she was his girlfriend). While annoyed at the fact she had been lying about them being an "item," Sonic still had a duty to rescue her and did so, but to his horror realised that she was now a fugitive and would have to stay with the Freedom Fighters. 

Amy's character swiftly matured as the comic went on and became one of the most valuable members of the Freedom Fighters, especially due to her expert marksmanship with her [[crossbow]] (which she created herself). The notion of a love interest in Sonic was, for the most part, underplayed and one of the comic's writers, Nigel Kitching, revealed he saw it partly as Amy just trying to annoy Sonic.<ref>[http://groups.yahoo.com/group/sonicthecomic/message/13701 Yahoo! Groups<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Several times, Sonic would be left exasperated by either civilians assuming the two were dating (which Amy would play along with) or her playing up the crush - because of this, when trapped on the Miracle Planet with her, he faked being lost for two days.<ref>Sonic the Comic #61, "The Brotherhood Of Metallix part 3"</ref>

She appeared often in strips, with a few solo stories by [[Lew Stringer]] where she saved the day without the others noticing. She constantly showed pragmatism and quick-thinking: in the story "Plasma" in #78, she both worked out how to defeat the villain and let Sonic believe he had as she knew that, as a symbol of hope for Mobius, "it's important that they think it's ''him'' who saves the day!". She also took a second-in-command role, taking full control when Sonic was absent or transformed into Super Sonic; when Sonic was lost in the Special Zone, she led the Freedom Fighters<ref>From Sonic the Comic #89, the "Sonic's World" back-up strips</ref> until he returned in #100.   At a later part of the comic's life, Amy would be mostly written by Lew Stringer as a straighforward adventurer and had a long series of back-up strips teamed up with her best friend [[Freedom Fighters (Sonic the Comic)#Tekno the Canary|Tekno]]. 

Nigel Kitching originally planned for Amy to be more of an irritant for Sonic, influenced by 1930s/40s "Hollywood screwball comedies" like [[It's a Wonderful World]], but while still being a capable fighter. ("But what Amy was not and never was some weak soppy character who swooned over Sonic like a silly little girl. Well, she did but we were never quite sure if she just doing it for a laugh.") However, Deborah Tate wanted the character to be of a role model for girls, as she was the only female regular character at the time, and dictated that she be more sensible and mature.<ref>http://groups.yahoo.com/group/sonicthecomic/message/13701 Nigel Kitching on Amy Rose</ref>

===''Sonic X: The Comic''===

Amy Rose's appearance in the Sonic X comic is similar to the one in the [[Sonic X]] anime.
In this comic book version her and Sonic's relationship developed more closely, Sonic even took her on a date for Valentines Day (though this was due to the fact that he lost a bet to Knuckles and just to be nice). However after the date when Amy asked Sonic if they would go on a date again, Sonic answered with: "Maybe?"

===''Sonic : Adventures ===
Two French-made comic books published by [[Sir<U+00E8>ne]] were
released on 1994. Amy appears in the first volume ( "Sonic Adventures: Dans Les Griffes De Robotnik") being kidnapped by Robotnik as bait to get Sonic. This version of Amy had the same design as in [[Sonic CD]].

==Personality==
Amy's character is the bright and overly cheerful self-appointed girlfriend of Sonic.<ref name="Sonic Adventure Profile">Amy's profile from the [[Sonic Adventure]] manual</ref> She loves soft-serve ice cream and hates boredom,<ref name="Amy's Sonic Channel profile"/> has a natural initiative,<ref name="Sonic Heroes Profile">Amy's profile from the [[Sonic Heroes]] manual</ref> and a strong competitive streak,<ref name="Sonic Adventure Profile"/> but gets into trouble often.<ref name="Sonic Central">{{cite web |author=Sega of America |publisher = Sega of America |url=http://www.sega.com/sonic/globalsonic/post_allabout.php?article=soniccharacters |title=Amy's official character profile from Sega of America |accessdate=2008-03-10}}</ref> With her strong sense of intuition and great passion<ref name="Sonic Adventure 2 Profile">Amy's profile from the [[Sonic Adventure 2]] manual</ref> Sonic has difficulty escaping her.<ref name="Sonic Heroes Profile"/> Because of her pure heart<ref name="Sonic Adventure 2 Profile"/> her character has often been used as the series [[Ingenue (stock character)|Ingenue]].

Upon being asked by Sega.com if Sonic and Amy will ever get married, creator [[Yuji Naka]] said<ref name="Sonicteam">Sonicteam.com, [http://www.sega.com/sonic/globalsonic/post_sonicteam.php?article=nakainterview Yuji Naka interview about Amy Rose]. URL accessed on [[March 26]], [[2006]]</ref> that "there will hardly be any chance, I bet. Amy will continue to pursue Sonic all the time, but Sonic will not ever get married. I think so, because I cannot picture the image of Sonic that he is married and has his children! Also, I feel it is a more Amy's style to always chase Sonic."

==Abilities==
As with all the other hedgehogs of the series, she can run somewhat fast, and has been seen to roll into balls just like Sonic. She also can occasionally use the homing attack and can also change to become invisble (as shown in ''[[Sonic the Hedgehog (2006)|Sonic the Hedgehog]]''). Notably, she has never had access to any known form of super form in any media.

Amy also has tarot cards. She has been seen using them before her transformation to her older self. They have not been seen since then. She has been able to successfully tell the futures of Knuckles, Sonic, Tails, and unknown to her Shadow and Rouge. She apparently helped Sonic and Tails in battle by predicting Eggman's robots' movements and finding his weakness.

Amy in the beginning was always seen as the [[damsel in distress]]. However, lately she has been seen helping, supporting or even protecting her friends. With her Piko Piko Hammer, tarot cards and strength she has come into a more strengthening feministic role. She is now unafraid to step into battle, especially if she's protecting Sonic or Cream. Even without her hammer, Amy has a few martial art skills.
 
===The Piko-Piko Hammer===
Also known as the Love Hammer in ''[[Sonic Battle]]'' in-game, Amy's Piko-Piko Hammer is based on a popular Japanese toy of the same name. They are common in Japanese comedy, where a person is often hit with the toy hammer, producing a loud "piko" sound. In western countries, it is known as a "squeaky hammer" or simply "toy hammer". In the [[Sonic the Hedgehog series]], the Piko-Piko Hammer is Amy's weapon of choice. She usually uses it to defend herself and her friends, but she will also use it to threaten her friends if they annoy or anger her. The handle of the hammer is yellow and the head of the hammer is yellow and red.

The Piko-Piko Hammer has several powerful abilities, including the power to create small tornadoes. Amy is also able to conjure multiple hammers, allowing her to continue attacking even if she has lost or thrown one. The hammer first appeared in ''Sonic the Fighters'', where it appeared to be a toy squeaky mallet, which squeaked comically when it struck an enemy. By the time the hammer next appeared, it appears to be very hard indeed and instead of squeaking, it makes a distinct, less squeaky ''piko-piko'' sound. She can also change the size of the hammer and its capabilities.

In the anime [[Sonic X]] Amy seems to be able to pull the Piko-Piko Hammer [[Hammerspace|out of thin air]] multiple times such as in during the situation at the end of the 2nd season of the show when [[Doctor Eggman]] was disrupting everyone late at night: Amy threw her hammer at Doctor Eggman, severely denting his airship, then pulls out another and continues to throw them constantly.
