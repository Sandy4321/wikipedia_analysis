==History==
The house was built over the course of five years by Nancy and Eugene Bavinger, the residents of the house, who were artists, along with the help of a few of Eugene's art students, volunteers, and local businesses.  

The Bavingers moved into the house in February 1955, and ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' magazine featured the house in its September 19, 1955 issue.<ref> {{cite news | title = Space and Saucer House: Oklahoma family lives in suspension in a unique new structure | date = September 19, 1955 | url = http://books.google.com/books?id=t1YEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA155 | work = [[Life (magazine)|LIFE]] | pages = 155<U+2013>156 }}</ref>  Despite its remote location, the house became an attraction; the Bavingers first tried to limit visitors by charging a dollar per guest.  ''Life'' reported that the tours had yielded over $4,000, and eventually (according to Goff) they raised over $50,000 before finally deciding they didn't want to be disturbed by the constant flow of guests.<ref>Philip Welch, ''Goff on Goff: Conversations and Lectures'' ([[University of Oklahoma Press]], 1996), ISBN 978-0-8061-2868-9), pp.193<U+2013>94.

The house later deteriorated and was vacant for more than a decade before it was reported in 2008 that the house would be renovated and reopened for tours.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.normantranscript.com/columns/local_story_328025808/resources_printstory|title=Foundation hopes to restore and open Bavinger House for tours|date=November 23, 2008|work=The Norman Transcript|accessdate=2009-08-13}}</ref> According to press reports, fundraising efforts ran into difficulties.<ref name="Gazette"/><ref name="Cobb"> {{cite news | first = Russell | last = Cobb | title = Continuous Present | date = November 21, 2011 | url = http://thislandpress.com/11/21/2011/continuous-present/?read=complete | work = [[This Land Press|This Land]] | accessdate = 2013-02-25}}</ref> In June 2011, after a windstorm in the area, it was reported that the house had been severely damaged, with its central spire broken at a 45-degree angle.<ref name="Gazette">{{cite news|title = Tearin' Down the House?|url=http://www.okgazette.com/oklahoma/article-12199-tearin%E2%80%99-down-the-house.html|work = [[Oklahoma Gazette]] | date = June 29, 2011 |accessdate=September 3, 2001}}</ref><ref> {{cite news | title = Gunfire Greets News 9 Crew at Norman's Bavinger House | date = June 21, 2011 | url = http://www.news9.com/story/14952275/gunfire-greets-news-9-crew-at-normans-bavinger-house | work = [[KWTV]] | accessdate = 2011-06-23}}</ref>  The official website for the house stated that the house "will not be able to re-open",<ref name="Cobb"/><ref> {{cite news | first = Andy | last = Rieger | title = Bavinger House<U+2019>s future uncertain | date = June 22, 2011 | url = http://normantranscript.com/headlines/x1521798676/Bavinger-House-s-future-uncertain | work = [[The Norman Transcript]] | accessdate = 2011-06-23}}</ref><ref> {{cite news | first = Richard | last = Mize | title = Bruce Goff-designed Bavinger House in Norman apparently has met its demise | date = June 23, 2011 | url = http://newsok.com/bruce-goff-designed-bavinger-house-in-norman-apparently-has-met-its-demise/article/3579645#ixzz1Q6x4RbNm | work = [[The Oklahoman]] | accessdate = 2011-06-23}}</ref><ref> {{cite web | url = http://www.thebavingerhouse.org | title = The Bavinger House official website | accessdate = 2013-02-25 | archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20110728092644/http://thebavingerhouse.org/ | archivedate = 28 July 2011 | quote = Closed due to storm damage . . .

==Architecture==
The wall of the house is a 96-foot long logarithmically curved spiral, made from 200 tons of local "ironrock" [[sandstone]] dynamited (by Eugene) from a piece of purchased farmland near Robin Hill School, a few miles away from the house and hauled back on Eugene's 48 Chevy flatbed truck.  The structure was anchored by a recycled oil field drill stem that was reused to make a central mast more than 55 feet high.  The house has no interior walls; instead there are a series of platforms at different heights, some with curtains that can be drawn for privacy.  The ground floor is covered with pools and planted areas.<ref name="NHRP"/><ref>{{cite news|url=http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/chicagotribune/access/517797542.html?dids=517797542:517797542&FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:AI&type=historic&date=Jan+06%2C+1957&author=&pub=Chicago+Tribune&desc=It%27s+SOMEBODY%27S+Dream+House&pqatl=google|title= It's SOMEBODY'S Dream House: Oklahoma Couple Are Happy in a Home Which Is Like Nothing on Land or Sea FAMILY Living|last=Barry |first=Edward |date=January 6, 1957 |work= Chicago Tribune|page=H23 |accessdate=2009-08-13}}</ref><ref> {{cite news | first = Lynette | last = Lobban | title = Goff's Historic Houses: The talk of the town when first constructed, the signature works of a master architect are being added to the National Register. | date = Spring 2002 | url = http://www.oufoundation.org/sm/spring2002/story.asp?ID=29 | work = Sooner Magazine | accessdate = 2011-06-23| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20110523232240/http://www.oufoundation.org/sm/spring2002/story.asp?ID=29| archivedate= May 23, 2011 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.greatbuildings.com/buildings/Bavinger_House.html|title=Bavinger House|work=GreatBuildings.com|accessdate=2009-08-13}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.archiplanet.org/buildings/Bavinger_House.html|title=Bavinger House|work=archiplanet.com|accessdate = 2011-11-10}}{{verify credibility|date=November 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.strangebuildings.com/bavinger-house-norman-usa/|title=Bavinger House (Norman, USA)|work=strangebuildings.com|date=February 24, 2010|accessdate = 2011-11-10}}{{verify credibility|date=November 2011}}</ref>
