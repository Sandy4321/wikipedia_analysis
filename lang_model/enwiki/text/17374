==Pioneering flights==

===Circumnavigation of Australia===
[[File:AWM128398.jpg|thumb|left|McIntyre (right) and Goble chaired by the crowd on St Kilda Beach after their round-Australia flight in 1924]]
In 1924, McIntyre and [[Wing Commander (rank)|Wing Commander]] [[Stanley Goble|Stanley (Jimmy) Goble]], another World War I veteran of the RNAS, became the first men to [[Circumnavigation|circumnavigate]] Australia by air.  McIntyre was lead pilot while Goble, who was [[Chief of Air Force (Australia)|Chief of the Air Staff]] at the time, acted as commander and [[navigator]]. The pair took off from [[RAAF Williams#RAAF Williams Point Cook Base|Point Cook]], [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], on 6 April 1924 in a single-engined [[Fairey III|Fairey IIID]] [[floatplane]]. They flew anticlockwise along the eastern coast to [[Thursday Island, Queensland|Thursday Island]], crossed the [[Gulf of Carpentaria]] to [[Darwin, Northern Territory|Darwin]], then continued along the Western Australian and South Australian coasts. Along the way they faced adverse weather, fatigue and illness, and had to deal with engine problems and fuel leaks.<ref name="Gillison" /><ref name="Stephens pp.39<U+2013>41">Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', pp.39<U+2013>41</ref>

McIntyre and Goble returned to Victoria after covering {{convert|8450|mi|km}} in 44 days. As they flew over Point Cook, 12 RAAF aircraft took off to escort them to their landing place at [[St Kilda, Victoria|St Kilda Beach]], where a crowd of 10,000 people was waiting to welcome them.<ref name="Stephens pp.39<U+2013>41"/> Prime Minister [[Stanley Bruce]] called the journey "one of the most wonderful accomplishments in the history of aviation"; his government presented McIntyre with a gift of <U+20A4>250, while mission commander Goble received <U+20A4>500.<ref name="Gillison"/> The British [[Royal Aero Club]] awarded the duo the annual [[Britannia Trophy]], and they were appointed [[Order of the British Empire|Commanders of the Order of the British Empire]] (CBE) in the [[Queen's Birthday Honours|King's Birthday Honours]].<ref name="Stephens pp.39<U+2013>41"/><ref>{{LondonGazette|issue=32941|supp=yes|startpage=4414|date=30 May 1924|accessdate=6 December 2007}}</ref> McIntyre was also awarded the [[Oswald Watt Gold Medal]] for 1924.<ref name="OWGM">[http://rfaca.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Oswald-Watt-Gold-Medal-Recipients-2013.pdf Oswald Watt Gold Medal winners list], [[Royal Federation of Aero Clubs of Australia]], retrieved 27 February 2014</ref>

===Pacific Islands flight===

In 1926, now a [[Flight Lieutenant]], McIntyre was selected as lead pilot on another pioneering Australian flight under the command of the-then Chief of the Air Staff, [[Group Captain]] [[Richard Williams (RAAF officer)|Richard Williams]], to study the South Pacific region as a possible theatre of operations. In company with [[Flight Sergeant]] Les Trist, they took off from Point Cook on 26 September 1926 and made a {{convert|10000|mi|km|sing=on}} round trip to the [[Solomon Islands]] in a [[De Havilland DH.50|De Havilland DH.50A]] floatplane.<ref name="Stephens pp.39<U+2013>41"/> They returned on 7 December to a 12-plane RAAF escort and a 300-man honour guard.<ref name="Wilson">Wilson, ''The Brotherhood of Airmen'', pp.34<U+2013>35</ref> 

Though considered partly a "matter of prestige" due to rumours of other countries planning such a journey, as well as a "reaction" by Williams to the 1924 expedition led by Goble, Williams' rival at the time for leadership of the young Air Force,<ref>Wilson, [http://www.library.unsw.edu.au/~thesis/adt-ADFA/uploads/approved/adt-ADFA20031029.102545/public/02chapter1.pdf "''The Eagle and the Albatross''"], pp.24&ndash;25</ref> it was the first international flight undertaken by an RAAF plane and crew.<ref name="Stephens pp.39<U+2013>41"/> McIntyre was awarded a second Oswald Watt Gold Medal;<ref name="OWGM"/> and a [[Medal bar|Bar]] to his AFC; for his part in the flight, while Trist received the [[Air Force Medal]],<ref>{{LondonGazette|issue=33280|supp=yes|startpage=3620|date=31 May 1927|accessdate=13 October 2008}}</ref> and Williams was appointed a CBE.<ref>{{LondonGazette|issue=33280|supp=yes|startpage=3611|date=31 May 1927|accessdate=8 June 2008}}</ref>

==Death and legacy==
Less than two years after his Pacific Islands flight, on 12 March 1928, Ivor McIntyre was killed in a flying accident.<ref name="Gillison"/> In 1994 he and Jimmy Goble were honoured by the issue of a [[postage stamp]] by [[Australia Post]], one of a series depicting Australian aviators that also included [[Freda Thompson]], [[Lawrence Hargrave]], Sir [[Keith Macpherson Smith|Keith]] and Sir [[Ross Macpherson Smith]].<ref>[http://www.powerhousemuseum.com/collection/database/?irn=141099 'Aviation Feats', Australia Post] at [[Powerhouse Museum]].
