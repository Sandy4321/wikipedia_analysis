'''Robert Ferdinand Wagner''' ([[8 June]] [[1877]]&ndash;[[4 May]] [[1953]]) was a [[United States Democratic Party|Democratic]] [[United States Senator]] from [[New York]] from [[1927]] until [[1949]]. 

==Origin and early life==
He was born in [[Nast<U+00E4>tten]], then in the Province [[Hesse-Nassau]], [[Kingdom of Prussia]], [[German Empire]] (now in [[Rhein-Lahn-Kreis]], [[Rhineland-Palatinate]], [[Federal Republic of Germany]]) and immigrated with his parents to the [[United States]] in 1885. His family settled in [[New York City]] and Wagner attended the public schools. He graduated from the [[College of the City of New York]] (now named [[City College of New York|City College]]) in 1898 and from [[New York Law School]] in 1900. He was admitted to the bar in 1900.

==Political career==
He was a member of the [[New York State Assembly]] from 1905 to 1908, and of the [[New York State Senate]] from 1909 to 1918. He was chosen [[Majority Leader of the New York State Senate]] for the 1911, 1912 and 1913 sessions, and became Acting [[Lieutenant Governor of New York]] after the impeachment of Governor [[William Sulzer]], and the succession of Lt. Gov. [[Martin H. Glynn]] to the governorship. In January 1915, following the loss of the Senate majority by the Democrats, he became Minority Leader until his retirement in 1918. Also, during his time in the Senate, he served as Chairman of the State Factory Investigating Committee (1911<U+2013>1915). Wagner was a delegate to the [[New York State Constitutional Convention]]s of 1915 and 1938, and a justice of the [[New York Supreme Court]] from 1919 to 1926.

==U.S. Senate==
Wagner was elected as a Democrat to the [[United States Senate]] in 1926, and reelected in 1932, 1938, and 1944. He resigned on [[June 28]], [[1949]], due to ill health. He was unable to attend any sessions of the 80th or 81st Congress from 1947 to 1949 because of a heart ailment.[http://www.nytimes.com/2006/12/14/washington/14senate.html?hp&ex=1166072400&en=86d5d2e95859ea0d&ei=5094&partner=homepage] Wagner was Chairman of the [[United States Senate Committee on Patents|Committee on Patents]] in the [[73rd United States Congress|73rd Congress]], of the [[U.S. Senate Committee on Public Lands and Surveys|Committee on Public Lands and Surveys]] in the [[73rd United States Congress|73rd]] and [[74th United States Congress|74th]] Congresses, and of the [[U.S. Senate Committee on Banking and Currency|Committee on Banking and Currency]] in the [[75th United States Congress|75th]] through [[79th United States Congress|79th]] Congresses. He was a delegate to the [[United Nations Monetary and Financial Conference]] in [[Bretton Woods, New Hampshire]] in 1944.

His most important legislative achievements include the [[National Industrial Recovery Act]] in 1933 and the [[Housing Act of 1937|Wagner-Steagall Housing Act<U+200E>]] of 1937.  After serving as chairman of the [[National Labor Board]] and witnessing first-hand its problems, he introduced and won passage of the [[National Labor Relations Act]], or '''Wagner Act''', that created the [[National Labor Relations Board]] in 1935. He also introduced the [[Railway Pension Law]], and cosponsored the [[Wagner-O'Day Act]], the predecessor to the [[Javits-Wagner-O'Day Act]].

Wagner and [[Edward P. Costigan]] sponsored a federal anti-Lynching law. In 1935 attempts were made to persuade President Franklin D. Roosevelt to support the Costigan-Wagner Bill. However, Roosevelt refused to support a bill that would punish sheriffs who failed to protect their prisoners from lynch mobs. He believed that he would lose the support of Southern Democrats in Congress and lose his entire New Deal program. There were 18 lynchings of blacks in the South in 1935, but after the threat of federal legislation the number fell to eight in 1936, and to two in 1939.

==Death and legacy==
Wagner was a Brother of Phi Sigma Kappa during his college years at the Zeta Chapter of the City College of New York.

After leaving the Senate, Mr. Wagner was a partner in the firm later known as [[Finley, Kumble, Wagner, Underberg, Manley, Myerson & Casey]].<ref>[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE7DB1F3DF932A25752C1A961948260&sec=&spon=&pagewanted=1 Finley, Kumble, Major Law Firm, Facing Revamping or Dissolution - New York Times<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

Robert Wagner died in New York City and is interred in [[Calvary Cemetery, Queens|Calvary Cemetery]], [[Queens]], [[New York City]].

His son was [[Robert F. Wagner, Jr.]], Mayor of New York City from 1954 to 1965.

On [[September 14]], [[2004]], a portrait of Wagner, along with one of Senator [[Arthur H. Vandenberg]], was unveiled in the Senate Reception Room. The new portraits joined a group of distinguished former Senators, including [[Henry Clay]], [[Daniel Webster]], [[John C. Calhoun]], [[Robert M. La Follette, Sr.]], and [[Robert A. Taft]]. Portraits of this group of Senators, known as the "Famous Five", were unveiled on [[March 12]], [[1959]].

Robert Wagner's legacy continues to this day; there is a middle school named after him on the upper east side of Manhattan.
