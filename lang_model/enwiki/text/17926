'''Antoinism''' is a [[Healing|healer]] and [[Christian]]-oriented [[new religious movement]] founded in 1910 by the [[Wallonia|Walloon]] Louis-Joseph Antoine (1846<U+2013>1912) in [[Jemeppe-sur-Meuse]], [[Seraing]].<ref name="Gascoin"/><ref name="Quid"/><ref>{{cite book |last=Beit-Hallahmi|first=Benjamin |authorlink=Benjamin Beit-Hallahmi |title=The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Active New Religions, Sects and Cults |origyear=1993 |publisher=Rosen Pub.

Raised a Catholic, Antoine worked as a [[coal miner]] in his youth, then as a [[steelworker]], before performing his military service in 1866. After marrying Catherine in 1873, he moved several times for professional reasons. Deeply impressed by [[Allan Kardec]]'s writings, he organized a spiritualist group in the 1890s. In 1893, the death of his son marked the definitive loss of his faith in Catholicism. In 1896, he explained his new [[spiritualist]] views in a book, then discovered the [[gifts of healing]]. Quickly known as a healer, he gathered many followers, mainly among workers disappointed by Catholicism or medicine. In 1906, he broke with spiritualism and started a religion, then published three books outlining his doctrine and consecrated the first antoinist temple. After his death in 1912, Catherine ensured the continuity of the religion, promoting a centralized worship around the person of her husband and providing additional rules in the organization. When she died in 1940, some differences happened between the French and the Belgian temples.

Antoinist beliefs combine some elements of [[Catholicism]], [[reincarnation]], and [[healing]]. In the antoinist views, the man must reach consciousness by getting rid of the illusion of matter produced by his intelligence <U+2014> the source of evil and suffering. The purpose of the life is to release oneself from the cycle of reincarnation through a moral progression aided by "fluids" <U+2014> all human actions, acquiered by silent prayer and the harm caused by diseases and enemies. As [[freedom of conscience]] and free will are considered very important in antoinist creed, the religion does not practice [[proselytism]] and is not exclusive. It does not provide any prescription on social issues. Although focused on healing, Antoinism does not interfere with the medical field, and does not discourage the resort to traditional medicine.

Simple and brief, services are performed in the temples, generally twice per day, and are composed of two forms of worship: "The General Operation", which consists of the transmission of the fluid to the churchgoers, and "The Reading" of Antoine's writings. Members who performed the services wear an entirely black dress, as sign of an intense involvement in the religion; they are not paid. Temples are also the place of consultations of a healer by people who wish to obtain a request, frequently related to health. Antoinist celebrations include [[Christian holidays]] and other three days that commemorate the founding couple and the dedication of the first temple. Registered as organism of public utility in Belgium and as [[religious association]] in France, the religion is directed by a college composed of the most active members called ''desservants''. It is financed by anonymous donations and do not ask for money from its followers. In France, the [[cult]] classification of Antoinism in the [[List of groups referred to as cults or sects in government documents|1995 Parliamentary Report]] was generally criticized by the sociologists who studied the religious group.

==History ==
===1846<U+2014>1912: Founder Louis Antoine===
Louis-Joseph Antoine was born on 7 June 1846 in [[Mons-Crotteux]] to a [[Roman Catholic]] family.<ref>[[#Vivier|Vivier, 1989]], p. 9.</ref> He was the youngest of eight children <U+2014> five brothers and two sisters, two of whom apparently died in infancy.<ref>[[#Vivier|Vivier, 1989]], p. 19.</ref> His mother was Catherine Castille, born in 1797. He was raised in the Priesse street and attended primary school in Mons.<ref name="Lallemand45">[[#Lallemand|Lallemand, 1994]], p. 45.</ref> From the age of twelve, Louis was employed as a coal miner, following in the footsteps of his father,<ref>[[#Vivier|Vivier, 1989]], p. 24.</ref> and though young, showed great piety.<ref>[[#Vivier|Vivier, 1989]], p. 26.</ref> One day, while working at the mine, his lamp went out without apparent reason, which he interpreted as a divine sign that he should abandon this work.<ref>[[#Vivier|Vivier, 1989]], pp. 30,31.</ref> Later, he was a [[steelworker]] in the Cockerill factory in Seraing.<ref>[[#Dericquebourg|Dericquebourg, 1993]], p. 11.</ref> He was enrolled in the [[militia]] of Belgium in 1866, and filled his military obligations in [[Bruges]].<ref name="Lallemand45"/> During the [[Franco-Prussian War]], he accidentally killed a comrade, an event which led him to question the meaning of life. After marrying Jeanne Catherine Collon on 15 April 1873,<ref>[[#Vivier|Vivier, 1989]], p. 108.</ref> he became the father of a son, Louis Martin Joseph, born in Hamborn, [[Prussia]] on 23 September 1873, and baptized five days later.<ref>[[#Vivier|Vivier, 1989]], p. 112,113.</ref> The family moved to Poland for professional reasons,<ref>[[#Dericquebourg|Dericquebourg, 1993]], p. 12.</ref> then went in Belgium in August 1876,<ref name="Lallemand45"/> where Antoine became a vegetable vendor.<ref>[[#Vivier|Vivier, 1989]], p. 122.</ref> In 1878, he began to suffer from recurring [[stomach aches]].<ref>[[#Begot|B<U+00E9>got, 1997]], <U+00A7> 7.</ref> In February 1879, he returned to Poland; there his wife ran a school canteen.<ref name="Lallemand45"/> The family moved to Jemeppe-sur-Meuse (Belgium) in 1888,<ref name="Deric13">[[#Dericquebourg|Dericquebourg, 1993]], p. 13.</ref> where he did build twenty houses for workers.<ref name="Lallemand46">[[#Lallemand|Lallemand, 1994]], p. 46.</ref>

Despite his strong faith, Antoine was unsatisfied with his religion. He began to be influenced by the writings of [[Allan Kardec]] and started a [[spiritualist]] movement called "The Vine Growers of the Lord" ("Les Vignerons du Seigneur").<ref name="Deric13"/> After the death of his son on 23 April 1893,<ref>[[#Dericquebourg|Dericquebourg, 1993]], p. 14.</ref> he and the group definitively broke with [[Christianity]]. Antoine published in 1896 a book entitled ''Little Spiritualist Catechism'' (''Petit cat<U+00E9>chisme spirite'') to explain his own doctrinal views. He then discovered the gifts of healing and by 1900, he received many sufferers to heal; thenceforth, he was known as the "healer of Jemeppe". He distributed remedies learned from Spiritualism and  advocated [[vegetarianism]], as well as temperance and avoidance of fatty foods.<ref>[[#Dericquebourg|Dericquebourg, 1993]], p. 16.</ref> In 1900, the prosecutor of [[Liege]] asked two doctors to investigate the healing activities of Antoine. They noticed his "absolute sincerity", but also asserted that his activities could be "a danger to public health".<ref>[[#Dericquebourg|Dericquebourg, 1993]], p. 17.</ref> He was eventually sentenced to a fine of 60 francs and suspended.<ref name="Lallemand46"/> He posted an advertisement in the spiritualist journal ''The Messenger'' (''Le Messager''), seeking doctors who would associate with him, but the attempt did not meet with success. At the same time, he was deeply influenced by L<U+00E9>on Denis' book ''In the Invisible''.<ref>[[#Begot2|B<U+00E9>got, 2000]], <U+00A7> 7,8.</ref> In 1905, he consulted up to 400 patients a day.<ref>[[#Debouxhtay2|Debouxhtay, 1934]], p. 149.</ref>

[[Image:Temle antoiniste jemeppe.JPG|thumb|right|130px|The temple in Jemeppe-sur-Meuse, the first one of the religion, was consecrated by Antoine in 1910.]]

In 1906, Antoine discovered a spirituality he called a "new spiritualism", which led him to give up his remedies as well as traditional [[spiritualism]], to decide to heal by faith alone and to perform only collective healing in a temple, and thus started to lay the foundations of a structured religious movement.<ref>[[#Dericquebourg|Dericquebourg, 1993]], p. 20.</ref> Probably at this time, Antoine's nickname "Antoine the Healer" (Antoine le Gu<U+00E9>risseur) was replaced by "Antoine the Generous" (Antoine le G<U+00E9>n<U+00E9>reux), and the moral dimension became more present in the doctrine.<ref>[[#Roure|Roure, 1925]], p. 179.</ref> On 15 June 1907, he was again sued by a court but was acquitted.<ref>[[#Dericquebourg|Dericquebourg, 1993]], p. 18.</ref> From 1907 to 1909, he published three books which explained his new doctrine and which contained "The Ten Principles of the Father".<ref>{{cite book |title=Les marges du christianisme <U+2014> "Sectes", dissidences, <U+00E9>sot<U+00E9>risme |first=Jean-Pierre |last=Chantin |publisher=Beauchesne |place=Paris |year=2001 |language=French |url=http://books.google.fr/books?id=chQ-z_5EYIkC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Dictionnaire+du+monde+religieux+dans+la+France+contemporaine++Par+Jean-Pierre+Chantin&hl=fr&ei=__uHTKPTB4_gONT_vbIN&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CDEQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q&f=false |pages=4<U+2014>6 |isbn=2-7010-1418-0}}</ref> Then from May 1909 to Easter 1910, he did not appear publicly, and lived in isolation to practice [[fasting]] and [[prayer]]; during this period, the worship was assumed by one of his followers,<ref>[[#Begot2|B<U+00E9>got, 2000]], <U+00A7> 10<U+2014>11.</ref> Mr. Deregneaucourt, who also published the Antoinist literature.<ref>{{cite journal| title=A New Sect and its Prophet <U+2014> Antoinism Has 160,000 Followers in Belgium |journal=[[The Sun (New York)|The Sun]] |date=25 December 1910 |place=New York}}</ref> On 15 August 1910, Antoine consecrated the temple of Jemeppe-sur-Marne, located in the Alfred Smeets street and which cost about 100,000 francs. On 2 December 1910, 160,000 signatures were gathered to demand official recognition of the Antoinist religion.<ref>[[#Lallemand|Lallemand, 1994]], p. 47.</ref> Antoine presented his wife as his successor and appointed a council composed of followers to manage financial issues of the religion. Named "The Father" by his followers, he died on 25 June 1912 and 100,000 faithful came to pray over his body.<ref>[[#Dericquebourg|Dericquebourg, 1993]], p. 21.</ref>

===1912<U+2014>1940: Wife Catherine as successor===
The illiterate wife of Louis Antoine, Catherine (born 26 May 1850, Jemeppe sur Meuse <U+2013> died 3 November 1940, Jemeppe sur Meuse),<ref name="Deric2002">[[#Dericquebourg2|Dericquebourg, 2002]], pp. 42<U+2014>44.</ref> called "The Mother" by the followers, was designated by him as his successor, but received no advice from him on how to manage the religion.<ref>[[#Dericquebourg|Dericquebourg, 1993]], pp. 22,25.</ref>

To seek to prevent any misappropriation of the charism of Antoine within the movement after his death, the antoinist journal ''L'Unitif'' published articles which presented Catherine as the legitimate successor and also redefined precisely the limits of the healers' role.<ref>[[#Begot2|B<U+00E9>got, 2000]], <U+00A7> 19,20.</ref> To avoid a succession crisis and to ensure the continuity of the religion, Catherine decided to promote a centralized worship around the person of her husband and thus established various rules between 1925 and 1930. For example, she placed, in the temple before the high platform, the photograph of her husband, called 'The Father', with the mention "The Father is making the Operation", then added her own portrait. She also authorized the ''desservants'' <U+2014> the members the most involved in the religion <U+2014> to perform the General Operation from the higher platform, but wanted that the ceremony would be preceded by a statement that it is the Father who performs the Operation and that the faith must be placed in him to obtain satisfaction. She insisted that the ''desservant'' installed in the platform would be sat during the reading of Antoine's writings. She also organized the Father's day, on 25 June, and rituals such as baptism, communion and marriage, which transformed the group into institutionalized religion.<ref>[[#Begot2|B<U+00E9>got, 2000]], <U+00A7> 21,22.</ref> She ordered that nothing should be changed in her husband's writings and in 1932 closed [[reading room]]s in which followers gave personal teachings.<ref>[[#Dericquebourg|Dericquebourg, 1993]], pp. 23,24.</ref> However, unlike the writings of her husbands which can be sold by anyone, changes and rules established by Catherine are recorded in books only available to the ''desservants'', thus remaining confidential.<ref>[[#Begot2|B<U+00E9>got, 2000]], <U+00A7> 24.</ref>

In 1931, a street in [[Spa (Belgium)|Spa]] was named "Father Antoine Street" after a decision by the Liberal Party of the city.<ref>{{cite book |first=Jacques |last=C<U+00E9>cius |title=Une religion de gu<U+00E9>rison : l'Antoinisme |date=2009 |page=42 |language=French}}</ref>

===1940<U+2014>present: Continuity of the worship===
The history of Antoinism was very quiet after 1940. In Belgium, the brother Joseph Nihoul, the President of the Antoinist Council, then his successors, led the religion until their death, alongside the members of this body.<ref>[[#Dericquebourg|Dericquebourg, 1993]], p. 25.</ref> The authority of Catherine was challenged just after her death by the Belgian branch of the movement, which has withdrawn the religious changes she made: removal of photographs in the temples, deletion of baptism, marriage and communion, opposition to the translation of Antoine's works... However, a Belgian group who, claming to be faithful to the true antoinist tradition, opened a temple in [[Angleur]] on 1 April 1943, preferred to keep the portraits of the Antoines in the temple.<ref>[[#Debouxhtay|Debouxhtay, 1945]], p. 27.</ref> In France, the antoinists wanted to be faithful to all requirements provided by the founding couple. In spite of these differences, the two branches show each other support and tolerance. Thus, after the death of Catherine, there were two forms of Antoinism, which still remain different today: one in Belgium, and one in France.<ref>[[#Dericquebourg|Dericquebourg, 1993]], pp. 26<U+2014>30.</ref>

In Belgium, the growth of the religion quickly begin to slow down, even to decline, as indicated by the fact that no temple has been built since 1968 and that several of them are currently unused because of a lack of dressed members and/or money. In contrast, the constructions of the temples in France has been continued until 1993, when a new temple in Toulouse was opened.<ref name="R136">[[#Dericquebourg|Dericquebourg, 1993]], pp. 136,137.</ref>

==Beliefs==
{{Quote box|width=30%|align=right|quote="The only remedy which can heal humanity is THE FAITH; Faith is born of Love; that kind of Love which convinces us that God dwells in our very enemies; hence not loving our enemies is not loving God; it is the Love we have for our enemies that renders us worthy of serving him; it is the sole Love which makes us really loving, because it is pure and true" |source=<U+2014>Translation of "The Halo of Consciousness", written on the back wall in the temple. }}

===Theology===
Antoinism believes in a [[dualistic]] universe composed of a spiritual world governed by the law of God or [[consciousness]], and of a corporal world, governed by natural laws, in which matter is an illusion perceived by the imagination generated by intelligence. The man combines in himself both worlds, as he has a physical body and a divine consciousness.<ref>[[#Dericquebourg|Dericquebourg, 1993]], p. 35.</ref> In Antoinist views, the importance of human laws and science is weakened as they are based not on consciousness, but on intelligence.<ref name="Deric2002"/> The view of the matter is, however, not considered a sin, but an error that causes suffering.<ref>[[#Dericquebourg|Dericquebourg, 1993]], p. 37.</ref>

The religious movement believes in a moral progression through [[reincarnation]] after death: the transmigration of the spirit in a human body only reflects the degree of spiritual elevation. The reincarnated person has no recollection of the past lives, and can again make progress in his spiritual course that allows him, at the end, to reach the divine state which releases him from the cycle of reincarnation.<ref name="Deric2002"/> The harm caused by disease and by people is seen as a beneficial cure, as the pain can increase one's spiritual progress and thus contribute to one's [[salvation]]. It is therefore highly recommended to love one's enemies. The silent [[prayer]] is also considered as a way to connect the spirit to consciousness.<ref>[[#Dericquebourg|Dericquebourg, 1993]], p. 38.</ref> Antoine, who suffered from disease and demonstrated [[asceticism]] and dedication throughout his life, is regarded by followers as a role model to attain salvation.<ref>[[#Begot2|B<U+00E9>got, 2000]], <U+00A7> 14.</ref>

Antoinist doctrine provides another interpretation to the [[original sin]] in the [[book of Genesis]]: Adam began to follow Eve, who had placed her confidence in a serpent, symbol of matter. By imagining the materiality of the physical world, he abandoned the divine consciousness in which he lived and produced the ideas of good and evil. The "[[tree of knowledge of good and evil]]" in the Bible is redefined as "the tree of the science of the sight of evil".<ref name="Deric2002"/> Antoinism claimed to not be an atheist religion, but has a particular conception of God: this one does not exist outside of humans, and they do not exist outside of God.<ref>{{cite web |title=Il Culto Antoinista |url=http://www.cesnur.org/religioni_italia/s/spiritismo_07.htm |publisher=[[CESNUR]] |language=Italian |accessdate=7 April 2011}}</ref>

Flexible and little binding, Antoinist beliefs are close to the contemporary belief, as followers can chose the beliefs they wish and interpret events as they want. The religion attaches great importance to [[freedom of conscience]] and free will, which renders it attractive and promotes a diversity of beliefs among the followers who can refer simultaneously to other religious traditions.<ref>[[#Masse|Mass<U+00E9>, 2002]], pp. 70,71,74.</ref> Some believers see Antoine as an incarnation of God; others, who continue to practice [[Catholicism]], consider him a prophet equal to [[Jesus Christ]]; others, who adhere to [[New Age]] doctrines, perceive him as a spiritual figure.<ref>[[#Begot2|B<U+00E9>got, 2000]], <U+00A7> 28<U+2014>33.</ref> The movement rejects indoctrination of children and prozelytism, and tolerates other religions, as they teach the faith and prayer and thus detach people from the material world.<ref name="Deric2002"/> It does not provide any prescription on issues such as divorce, abortion and sexuality,<ref name="Soir">{{cite journal |title=Antoinisme: Un produit wallon bas<U+00E9> sur une foi exclusive |url=http://archives.lesoir.be/antoinisme-un-produit-wallon-base-sur-une-foi-exclusive_t-19931026-Z07DU9.html |first=Marie-Pierre |last=Fonsny |journal=[[Le Soir]] |date=26 October 1993 |publisher=Rossel |place=Brussels |page=21 |language=French |accessdate=7 April 2011}}</ref> and do not use honorary titles, considering all people equal.<ref>[[#Lesourd|Lesourd, 1973]], pp. 79<U+2014>88.</ref> A periodical directed by writer [[Louis Pauwels]] summarized the main purposes of the religion as being the "mutual aid, spiritual and human solidarity, availability and hospitality".<ref>{{cite journal |title=Question de spiritualit<U+00E9>, tradition, litt<U+00E9>rature |first=H<U+00E9>l<U+00E8>ne |last=Renard |chapter=Sectes, mouvements, <U+00E9>coles |volume=17 |date=March-April 1977 |pages=53,54 |language=French}}</ref>

===Fluids===
Fundamental principle of the cosmos, the [[fluid]] is a recurrent theme in Antoinism. Thoughts, words, human actions and social ties are considered as fluids. As their quality depends on the moral progress of a person, there are "spiritual" and "heavy" fluids. They can be transmitted, perceived by the intelligence and purified through meditation. A good fluid is supposed to be acquired by love and prayer, and has various uses: it can act as a divine power that regenerates the whole person, destroy evil and heal. It is believed that Antoine can transmit the good fluid and that the temple platform is the place of the most number of fluids.<ref>[[#Dericquebourg|Dericquebourg, 1993]], pp. 42<U+2014>47.</ref>

As good fluids are supposed to be transferable, the antoinist dress used during the worship is often placed on the bed of a suffering person to help his recovery; similarly, some faithful put a request on a paper in a box under the platform so that the wish happen, others buy a photo of Antoine at a ceremony to be protected.<ref>[[#Begot3|B<U+00E9>got, 2008]], p. 10.</ref> To prevent negative fluids to enter the temple, several rules were established: for example, those who perform the worship are not allowed to wear jewelry or makeup in the building.<ref>[[#Begot3|B<U+00E9>got, 2008]], p. 9.</ref>

===Healing===
Although focused on healing, Antoinism does not propose any diagnosis nor [[prescription]], and does not practice the [[laying on of hands]];<ref>{{cite book |title=Le nuove sette religiose |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=-i83CZxw5B4C&printsec=frontcover&dq=Le+nuove+sette+religiose&hl=fr&ei=9SjzTdnSBpHOsgav8ryVBg&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CCoQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q&f=false |first=Michele C. |last=Del Re |publisher=Gremese Editore |place=Rome |year=1997 |language=Italian |pages=47,48 |isbn=88-7742-107-X}}</ref> the faithful may also resort to traditional medicine. In the books of the temple, it is stated that ''desservants'' are not allowed to discourage them to consult a doctor and they should pray that they find an "inspired" doctor. Generally, consulting an Antoinist healer is merely a supplement to [[allopathic medicine]].<ref>[[#Masse|Mass<U+00E9>, 2002]], p. 51.</ref><ref>[[#Begot2|B<U+00E9>got, 2000]], <U+00A7> 44<U+2014>46.</ref> Because of its healer doctrine, the religious group is almost always compared to [[Christian Science]];<ref>See the vast majority of the sources of the article</ref> however, in spite of several similarities with this religion as well as with [[Friedrich Hegel]]'s works, Belgian historian Pierre Debouxhtay rejected the idea that they could have been potential influences on Antoine's doctrines.<ref>[[#Debouxhtay|Debouxhtay, 1945]], p. 14.</ref>

Sociologist Anne-C<U+00E9>cile B<U+00E9>got considered the Antoinist healing of the first decades a form of protest against (1) the efficiency of medicine,<ref>[[#Bergeron|Bergeron, 1998]], p. 188.</ref> (2) the traditional representation of disease<ref>[[#Bergeron|Bergeron, 1998]], p. 189.</ref> <U+2014> the real healing can be attained only through a new approach to the disease, which is never considered a particular misfortune and thus is not reduced to its biological dimension <U+2014> and (3) the management of disease<ref>[[#Bergeron|Bergeron, 1998]], p. 191.</ref> <U+2014> sick are always responsible for their own illness. However, she concluded that this protest has evolved throughout time as (1) the disease is now represented on an [[endogenous]] etiological model, which indicates a process of individualization of the religion,<ref>[[#Bergeron|Bergeron, 1998]], p. 195.</ref> and (2) the personal real-life experience is more presented as the cause of the disease than the relation to the global society.<ref>[[#Bergeron|Bergeron, 1998]], p. 196.</ref>

==Practices==
===Worship===
The Antoinism worship takes place in temples. A dressed member welcomes anyone who enters the temple by calling them "brother" and "sister", even if they are just visitors. The service is very unceremonial and informal, as there is no liturgy, singing, or pre-set prayers,<ref>{{cite journal |title=La force de l'<U+00E2>me, rencontre avec les antoinistes caudr<U+00E9>siens |journal=L'Observateur du Cambr<U+00E9>sis |date=31 mai 2000 |page=3 |language=French}}</ref> and lasts up to 30 minutes. Attendance at worship is not required and many people come sporadically. According to sociologist R<U+00E9>gis Dericquebourg, "the antoinist worship is a ritual of intercession. (...) It is a time of big emotional intensity with an intimate aspect".<ref>[[#Dericquebourg|Dericquebourg, 1993]], p. 96.</ref>

The service is composed of two practices:
* "The General Operation" ("L'Op<U+00E9>ration G<U+00E9>n<U+00E9>rale") : Established by Antoine in 1910,<ref name="Deric2002"/> it begins and ends with three strokes of bell. It is briefly announced by a dressed member. After meditating in a room on the back of the temple, a ''desservant'' climb to the highest platform, and the dressed follower goes to the other platform. Both are standing and pray for a few minutes to transmit the fluid to the churchgoers. Then, if the reading of the sacred texts is scheduled just after, as it is the case in France, the ''desservant'' whispers to the dressed follower to perform the reading.<ref name="D94">[[#Dericquebourg|Dericquebourg, 1993]], pp. 94,95.</ref>
* "The Reading" ("La Lecture"): It lasts twenty minutes and consists of the reading of Antoine's book ''L'Enseignement'' by the dressed follower. The reading ends when he thanks the audience.<ref name="D94"/>

There are few differences in schedules between the services in Belgium and that of France (see the table).

===Consultations by a healer===
[[File:Antoinist plaque.JPG|thumb|140px|left|A plaque on the door of the temple indicates that suffering people can be received freely from morning to evening.]]
After the service, some people <U+2014> regular faithful or visitors <U+2014> may ask to consult a healer in one of the small rooms of the temple <U+2014> although the ''desservant'' who lives in the apartment adjacent to the temple is always available to receive suffering persons. During these consultations, both are standing before Antoine's image: the patient expresses for a few minutes the request that he wishes to obtain, and the healer prays, sometimes while touching the consultant's shoulder or hand, presumably to convey the fluid.<ref>[[#Begot2|B<U+00E9>got, 2000]], <U+00A7> 36-39.</ref><ref>[[#Begot|B<U+00E9>got, 1997]], <U+00A7> 45.</ref> The healer's work is said to put again the consultant in the love of God that will allow him to find himself the spiritual journey leading to healing. For this purpose, the healer has to discover the origin of the consultant's problem, which is, in Antoinist beliefs, always linked to a person's own history, and to understand that he should bear the consequences of what was done in a preceding life.<ref name="D4">[[#Dericquebourg4|Dericquebourg, 1993]]</ref>

The Antoinist healing process does not include a doctrinal teaching nor a [[psychological manipulation]]. It does not necessarily imply the end of the problem or illness, and can be divided into three phases: the relief provided by the healer through listening and intercession with God, then acceptance of the problem which requires the recognition of one's responsibilities, and finally the inner peace that results. Whether immediate or gradual, healings are never considered as [[miracle]]s in the religion because they are supposed to occur inevitably when all necessary conditions, including the faith of the patient, are met. Even after several consultations, the consultant does not necessarily become a follower. Several sociologists deemed the Antoinist healing as "[[exorcist]]" as well as "adorcist".<ref>[[#Dericquebourg|Dericquebourg, 1993]], pp. 106<U+2014>18.</ref>

===Marriage, communion, baptism and funeral===
Catherine established rituals such as [[baptism of infants]], blessing of couples and [[communion]] of young people. They simply consist of an "elevation of thought" that take place after the services in a consulting room of the temple. These rituals have no particular meaning in the religion and are not considered sacraments;<ref>{{cite book |title=Enciclopedia de las creencias y religiones |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=QL06hOJFSwAC&pg=PA50&dq=antonismo&hl=fr&ei=mIr2TaqFK5Kq8APw25ydBw&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=6&ved=0CEAQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&q=antonismo&f=false |first=Jorge |last=Blaschke |publisher=Ediciones Robin Book SA |year=2006 |language=Spanish |page=50 |isbn=970-732-158-X}}</ref> they are performed only at the request of followers, including young people, who want to provide a religious dimension to the important moments of their lives.<ref>[[#Dericquebourg|Dericquebourg, 1993]], p. 103.</ref> [[Funeral]] are also performed at the request of the concerned person, unless the family asks for rituals of another religion. The procession always takes place at the cemetery or the funeral home, and the deceased person is never brought to the temple. ''Desservants'' read the "Ten Principles of the Father", then an antoinist text on reincarnation, to help the soul to come off the body to be reincarnated. Sociologists note that many people who never attend the antoinist services asked for funeral rites of that religion.<ref>[[#Dericquebourg|Dericquebourg, 1993]], p. 104.</ref>

===Holidays===
As Antoine decided to model Antoinist holidays on Catholicism, followers celebrate [[Christian holidays]], including [[Toussaint]], [[Christmas]], [[Easter]], [[Easter Monday]] and [[Ascension]]; these days, appropriate portions of Antoine's works are read during the services. There are also three special days in Antoinism, and attendance at worship is generally higher at these moments:<ref name="Deric2002"/><ref>[[#Dericquebourg|Dericquebourg, 1993]], p. 93.</ref> (1) 25 June, the Father's Day. It was established by Antoine's wife shortly after his death. At first, Antoinists performed a pilgrimage to Jemeppe-sur-Meuse to participate in a procession  through the city which outlined the main events of Antoine's life. The procession was withdrawn in 1937 and the pilgrimage seems to be no longer organized. That day, the faithful pay homage to the founder in the temples;<ref>[[#Dericquebourg|Dericquebourg, 1993]], p. 91.</ref> (2) 15 August, the consecration of the temple's Day, which commemorates the consecration of the first temple; (3) 3 November, the Mother's Day, as anniversary of Catherine's death.

===Religious clothing and symbols===
Wearing Antoinist [[religious clothing]] indicates an intense involvement in the religion by the person who makes this choice. Although not mandatory, it is devoted to faithful who perform the worship, celebrations and other tasks in the temple <U+2014> all of them are called "moral work", as they are expected to participate in the moral elevation of followers.<ref name="B0812">[[#Begot3|B<U+00E9>got, 2008]], p. 12.</ref> Entirely black, the dress for men was designed by Antoine, and that for women by Catherine, who precisely codified their dimensions in their writings. There are also dresses for young people of both sexes, but they are never actually worn. Historically, the wearing of the dress was the subject of a debate among the first Antoinists, some of them refusing to wear it.<ref>[[#Dericquebourg|Dericquebourg, 1993]], p. 97.</ref> In the past, the dress was also worn in the street, and that was how the followers were immediately identified by the public.<ref>[[#Vivier|Vivier, 1989]], p. 330.</ref> Currently, it is generally only worn in the context of worship, and it is put and removed in the locker room of the temple. Clothing for men is composed of a dress which resembles the one worn by Catholic clergy in the monastery, and closed by 13 buttons, plus a cashmere top hat. Clothing for women is a wide dress accompanied with a cape and a [[Bonnet (headgear)|bonnet]] with a veil. In the Antoinist view, the [[Collar (clothing)|collar]] is important as it is believed that the fluid resides here.<ref>[[#Dericquebourg|Dericquebourg, 1993]], pp. 98,99.</ref>

The only emblem of Antoinism is the tree of knowledge of the sight of evil that features on the facade of the highest platform in the temple. It has seven branches which represent the [[seven deadly sins]], two eyes which symbolize the view of the sins, and the tree roots which are the symbol of the intelligence which links man to matter. In the branches the mention "Culte Antoiniste" ("Antoinist worship") is written.<ref>[[#Dericquebourg|Dericquebourg, 1993]], p. 87.</ref>

==Organization==
[[Image:Culte antoiniste Paris dsc07099.jpg|thumb|right|110px|Antoinist temples, such as the one in the [[13th arrondissement of Paris]], are exempt from [[property taxes]].]]
===Status===
In Belgium, the religion was organized as an [[association without lucrative purpose]] (absl) in 1922 and was immediately registered as organism of public utility.<ref>[[#Lallemand|Lallemand, 1994]], p. 48.</ref> It is not recognized as a public worship, because there is no worship of a deity in the ceremonies.<ref>{{cite book |title=Le financement des cultes et de la la<U+00EF>cit<U+00E9>: comparaisons internationales et perspectives |first=Jean-Fran<U+00E7>ois |last=Husson |url=http://books.google.fr/books?id=FFEQkqjx1P8C&printsec=frontcover&dq=Le+financement+des+cultes+et+de+la+la%C3%AFcit%C3%A9:+comparaison+internationale+et+...++Par+Jean-Fran%C3%A7ois+Husson&source=bl&ots=bBd189SPsQ&sig=S3c2ImUuTrttabA2nFOex8tFNHI&hl=fr&ei=xKaKTLeCGYa6jAe7q7mJBg&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CBYQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q&f=false |place=Belgium |year=2005 |page=648 |language=French |isbn=2-930378-26-3}}</ref> Currently headed by a college of ''desservants'',<ref>[[#Masse|Mass<U+00E9>, 2002]], p. 43.</ref> the religion is legally registered as [[religious association]] in France.<ref>[[#Masse|Mass<U+00E9>, 2002]], p. 50.</ref> It was published in the [[Journal Officiel de la R<U+00E9>publique Fran<U+00E7>aise]] of 9 February 1924, and the last modification of the statutes appeared in the JO of 3 August 1988. Antoinist worship has been exempt from [[property taxes]] on the public part of its buildings since 1925 in Belgium and in France since 1934.<ref>[[#Dericquebourg|Dericquebourg, 1993]], pp. 150,156.</ref>

===Places of worship===
{{main|List of antoinist temples}}
The [[temple]]s are Antoinism's only place of worship. They are financed with anonymous donations and [[patronage]]s, and often members participate in the construction. They are all consecrated prior to their use for worship, which means that, at a ceremony, they received a "good fluid" by one of the founders when they were alive or by a duly authorized follower.<ref>[[#Dericquebourg|Dericquebourg, 1993]], pp. 101,102,135.</ref>

The exterior facade displays an architecture which can be variable according to the temples, but always includes the words "Antoinist Worship" ("Culte Antoiniste") and the year of the building consecration. At the entrance, there is a [[porch]] where various writings of the religious movement, the internal regulations (in France only), the list of the places of worship and the holidays, as well as photos of the Antoine couple and of the various temples, are exhibited behind [[display windows]].<ref>[[#Dericquebourg|Dericquebourg, 1993]], p. 88.</ref>

[[File:Antoinist temples in a porch of a temple.jpg|thumb|left|140px|Photographs of the Antoinist temples, exhibited in the porch of each temple]]

The inside walls are always painted in green, as symbol of reincarnation. There is no decoration, and small papers on the walls indicate to visitors that they should not speak in the temple. Several rows of wooden benches separated by a center aisle are devoted to the faithful and visitors. They are facing a two-floor platform where the worship is performed, and a text called "The Halo of Consciousness" ("L'Aur<U+00E9>ore de la Conscience") which is written on the back wall. In France only, the highest platform is adorned, from left to right, with a representation of the "tree of science of the sight of evil", the Antoinist symbol, then a photo of Antoine and another one of Catherine; the photo of the Father is slightly higher than the other two.<ref>[[#Dericquebourg|Dericquebourg, 1993]], p. 89.</ref> On the left and the right, side rooms of around 15 m<U+00B3> are used as consulting offices whose walls are orned with five tables; the most impressive of them is Antoine's image.<ref>[[#Begot2|B<U+00E9>got, 2000]], <U+00A7> 37.</ref> There is also a [[cloakroom]] and, adjacent to the temple, a small apartment continuously occupied by an antoinist healer.<ref>[[#Dericquebourg|Dericquebourg, 1993]], p. 90.</ref>

The movement is also owner of [[reading room]]s, but no worship is celebrated in these places. As of 2011, Antoinism counts 64 temples: 32 in Belgium, 31 in France and 1 in the Principality of [[Monaco]]. It has also opened reading rooms in Belgium, Metropolitan France, [[R<U+00E9>union]], [[Guadeloupe]], Australia, Brazil, Italy, Congo and [[Luxembourg]].<ref>[[#Dericquebourg|Dericquebourg, 1993]], pp. 167,168.</ref>

===Publications===
[[File:Antoinist booklets.jpg|thumb|160px|right|Three antoinist booklets which contain some excerpts of Antoine's books]]
The Antoinist literature is mainly composed of Antoine's writings, considered as sacred by followers. They include three doctrinal books grouped into two volumes which are sold in the temples and read during the worship: ''Revelation of the Father'' (''La R<U+00E9>v<U+00E9>lation par le P<U+00E8>re''), ''The Coronation of the Revealed Work'' (''Le Couronnement de l'<U+0152>uvre r<U+00E9>v<U+00E9>l<U+00E9>e'') and ''Development of the Teaching of Father'' (''Le D<U+00E9>veloppement de l'Enseignement du P<U+00E8>re''). Many statements from the Antoines are gathered into 14 books called ''Tomes'', which remain only accessible to dressed members. From September 1911 to August 1914, the movement published a monthly newspaper, ''The Unitive'' (''L'Unitif''), which had 6,000 subscribers.<ref>[[#Dericqueboug|Dericquebourg, 1993]], pp. 61<U+2014>63.</ref> In 1936, Belgian writer [[Robert Vivier]] published a hagiographic biography <U+2014> although based on real facts <U+2014> of Louis Antoine, which is also used by Antoinists to strengthen their faith,<ref>{{cite journal |title= Vivier (Robert) ''D<U+00E9>livrez-nous du mal.

===Hierarchy and financial issues===
The organization, which is the most reduced as possible, is slightly different in France and Belgium:

In Belgium, a General Council was organized in 1911 by Antoine to manage all material issues. It is currently composed of nine members including a chairman, a treasurer and a secretary. The founction of the First Representative of the Father was abolished in 1971, and there are no internal regulations in the temples.<ref>[[#Dericquebourg|Dericquebourg, 1993]], pp. 146<U+2014>49.</ref> In France, the movement is led by a religious association called "Culte Antoiniste" ("Antoinist Worship"). All the ''desservants'' are part of a College of Desservants which manage the material issues, and whose decisions are implemented by an Administrative Committee. Within the college, a Moral Secretary is elected and serves as legal representative of the religion. Locally, the ''desservants'' nominate auxiliaries among the dressed followers so that they perform reading during worship and/or serve as healers. A Council of Local Interior composed of seven members including ''desservants'' is used for issues related to the temple on which it depends.<ref>[[#Dericquebourg|Dericquebourg, 1993]], pp. 151<U+2014>55.</ref> Women as well as men can be chosen as ministers,<ref>{{cite book |title=Fils d'Abraham: Panorama des communaut<U+00E9>s juives, chr<U+00E9>tiennes et musulmanes |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=6mYwAAAAYAAJ&q=antoinisme&dq=antoinisme&hl=fr&ei=j4D3TfPbF4i3hAfvraiDDA&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=5&ved=0CDwQ6AEwBDgU |volume=1 |first=Joseph |last=Longton |publisher=<U+00C9>ditions Brepols |year=1987 |language=French |page=35 |isbn=978-2-503-82344-7}}</ref> as Catherine promoted [[gender equality]] in the worship.<ref>{{cite book |title=Ni Eve ni Marie: luttes et incertitudes des h<U+00E9>riti<U+00E8>res de la Bible |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=2e5nDSAscPoC&pg=PA76&dq=antoinisme&hl=fr&ei=mYX3Tev3Hc-WhQf1-oWGDA&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=4&ved=0CDMQ6AEwAzgo#v=onepage&q=antoinisme&f=false |first=Fran<U+00E7>oise |last=Lautman |chapter=Proph<U+00E9>tesses, inspiratrices... R<U+00F4>les et images des femmes dans les religions minoritaires |publisher=Labor et Fides |place=Geneve |language=French |page=78 |isbn=2-8309-0882-1}}</ref> In all cases, Antoine, although deceased, remains the leader of the religion, which led Debouxhtay to compare him to the [[Pope]] in the Catholic Church.<ref name="D24">[[#Debouxhtay|Debouxhtay, 1945]], p. 24.</ref>

Antoinist healers are always dressed members, and are not paid. They do not attend specific training or receive any initiation rite. Those who want to access this function must feel spiritually "inspired" and obtain the desservant's approval. They must also promise to respect Antoinist rules including nondisclosure of confessions by consultants and not discouraging traditional medicine. Before receiving consultants, no kind of [[asceticism]] is required, but mental preparation includes prayer and meditation. Regarded as mere intercessors, healers have a "[[charisma]] of function" as they reproduce that of Antoine, which does not prevent some healers from becoming very popular among consultants.<ref name="D4"/><ref>[[#Begot|B<U+00E9>got, 1997]], <U+00A7> 31.</ref><ref>[[#Begot2|B<U+00E9>got, 2000]], <U+00A7> 40<U+2014>42.</ref>

Worship is practiced voluntarily, and ''desservants'' and dressed followers are not paid. When the founding couple was living, donations were rejected when the religion had enough money in its treasury. Only anonymous donations and [[bequest]]s are accepted, and they go to the "Antoinist worship"'s treasury.<ref>[[#Dericquebourg|Dericquebourg, 1993]], p. 157.</ref> In Belgium, the finances have been published in ''[[Le Moniteur Belge]]'' every year after the Council meeting.<ref name="D24"/>

===Membership===
There are four categories of Antoinists: ''desservants'' who perform worship, people who wear the religious clothing, regular faithful who attend the service every week, and occasional members or visitors.<ref name="Deric132">[[#Dericquebourg|Dericquebourg, 1993]], p. 132.</ref> As its aim is to heal and comfort through faith, Antoinism does not seek to convert new people.<ref>{{cite book |title=La France aux cent sectes |first=Jean-Pierre |last=Van Geirt |publisher=Vauvenargues |place=Manchecourt |date=1997 |page=45 |language=French |isbn=2-7443-0049-7}}</ref> The number of followers is difficult to assess as there are no statistics established by the religion.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Mouvements religieux |first=Regis |last=Dericquebourg |chapter=Les groupes religieux minoritaires <U+2014> Aspects et probl<U+00E9>matiques |publisher=Association d'<U+00C9>tude et d'Information sur les Mouvements Religieux |place=Sarreguemines |page=38 |language=French |issn=0242-7931}}</ref> After a period of rapid growth in Belgium, the number of followers is currently on the decline in the country and some temples were forced to close due to lack of money or faithful. In France, however, the religion remains active and counts about 2,500 regular members.<ref name="Soir"/> Estimates of the worldwide membership vary from few thousand to 200,000.<ref name="AN">{{Cite web |title=Rapport fait au nom de la Commission d'enqu<U+00EA>te sur les sectes <U+2014> "Les sectes en France" |url=http://www.assemblee-nationale.fr/rap-enq/r2468.asp |publisher =Assembl<U+00E9>e Nationale |language=French |year=1995 |accessdate=10 September 2010}}</ref> The future growth of the number of followers, however, can be affected by certain rules of the group. As it does not practice proselytism, Antoinism souffers from a lack of social visibility and many people do not know the existence of an antoinist temple in their neighborhood.<ref>[[#Dericquebourg|Dericquebourg, 1993]], p. 8.</ref> Moreover, because of the availability required for worship and the absence of income in the religion, dressed members and ''desservants'' are often old-age retired people.<ref name="B0812"/>

Mainly composed of 40- to 50-year-old people and a majority of women,<ref name="Deric132"/> the membership is almost the same as that which was attracted by spiritualism in Belgium in the 19th century. The followers have mostly modest social status, such as [[miners]] and [[artisans]],<ref>[[#Dericquebourg|Dericquebourg, 1993]], p. 119.</ref> and are generally people interested in spirituality, but who are at odds with the Catholic Church or display a skeptical attitude towards traditional medicine.<ref>[[#Dericquebourg|Dericquebourg, 1993]], p. 124.</ref> Antoinists are also sometimes Jews,<ref>[[#Dericquebourg|Dericquebourg, 1993]], p. 130.</ref> Muslims,<ref>Dericquebourg, R<U+00E9>gis (12 November 2009) (in French), "De la Belgique <U+00E0> Caudry: l'Antoinisme, une religion de gu<U+00E9>rison" [conference], Cambrai</ref> Buddhists,<ref>[[#Begot2|B<U+00E9>got, 2000]], <U+00A7>31.</ref> adepts of [[reiki]], [[yoga]], or [[tai chi chuan]],<ref>[[#Begot3|B<U+00E9>got, 2008]], p.13.</ref> or former Catholics.<ref name="R136"/> An accurate depiction of Antoinists of Northern France was made by writer [[:fr:Andr<U+00E9> Th<U+00E9>rive|Andr<U+00E9> Th<U+00E9>rive]] in his 1928 novel ''Without Soul'' (''Sans <U+00E2>me'').<ref>[[#Vivier|Vivier, 1989]], p. 374.</ref> In 1945, Debouxhtay described followers as "very kind, very charitable and very obliging people".<ref>[[#Debouxhtay|Debouxhtay, 1945]], p. 29.</ref>

The religion received little opposition from the Catholic Church, which has sometimes criticized it but only on doctrinal issues, considering it heretic.<ref>[[#Dericquebourg|Dericquebourg, 1993]], p. 144.</ref> For example, in 1918, priest of Li<U+00E8>ge Hubert Bourguet published a 50-page brochure in which he expressed concerns on the doctrines, qualified the sacred texts of Antoinism as "gibberish" and concluded that Antoine would have suffered from [[paraphrenia]].<ref>[[#Bourguet|Bourguet, 1918]], p.48.</ref> In 1925, Father Lucien Roure considered Antoinism "a doctrine of anarchy and amorality", with "negative teachings", confused and incoherent writings, and "credulous and docile" followers.<ref>[[#Roure|Roure, 1925]], pp. 180,185,186.</ref> In 1949, author Jacques Michel blamed Antoine for having substituted himself for Jesus Christ and deemed Antoinism a "demonic" faith.<ref>[[#Michel|Michel, 1949]], pp. 24,25.</ref> Later, in 1953, Maurice Colinon, then in 1954, the Father Henri-Charles Ch<U+00E9>ry, published books which analyzed non-conformist groups, including Antoinism.<ref>[[#Colinon|Colinon, 1953]], pp. 112<U+2014>22.</ref><ref>[[#Chery|Ch<U+00E9>ry, 1954]], pp. 251<U+2014>66.</ref>

According to Debouxhtay, [[Protestantism|Protestant]]s were concerned about the antoinist expansion in the 1930s, and several pastors published writings on this subject (Giron-Galzin, 1910; Rumpf, 1917; Wyss, c.1924).<ref>[[#Debouxhtay2|Debouxhtay, 1934]], p. 285.</ref> More recently, the religion was studied from a Protestant perspective by pastor G<U+00E9>rard Dagon.<ref>{{cite book |title=Petites <U+00C9>glises et grandes sectes en France aujourd'hui |first=G<U+00E9>rard |last=Dagon |publisher=SCE |place=Paris |date=1961 |language=French}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |title=Les sectes <U+00E0> visage d<U+00E9>couvert - Tome II |first=G<U+00E9>rard |last=Dagon |publisher=Editions Barnabas |date=1997 |language=French |isbn=2-908582-17-1}}</ref> From a philosophical standpoint, Antoinism was criticized by [[Ren<U+00E9> Gu<U+00E9>non]] in an entire chapter of his 1923 book ''The Spiritist Fallacy'' (''L'Erreur spirite''), noting, to his point of view, "the nullity of [Antoine's] "teachings" which are only a vague mixture of spiritualist theories and Protestant "moralism"".<ref>[[#Guenon|Gu<U+00E9>non, 1977]], pp. 349<U+2014>62.</ref>

==Classification==
In France, the Antoinist worship was classified as a [[cult]] in the [[List of groups referred to as cults or sects in government documents|1995 parliamentary reports]] which considered it one of the oldest healer groups.<ref name="AN"/> However, on 27 May 2005, the 1995 annex of the French report and cult classifications in which the antoinist worship was listed, were officially cancelled and invalidated by [[Jean-Pierre Raffarin]]'s circulaire.<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://www.lepoint.fr/content/societe/article?id=19641 |title=La fin des listes noires |journal=[[Le Point]] |publisher=Art<U+00E9>mis |place=Paris |language=French |date=23 June 2005 |accessdate=10 September 2010}}</ref> Books published by Belgian and French anti-cult associations and activists sometimes included Antoinism in their lists of cults, such as ''Cults, State of Emergency <U+2014> Better know them, better defend oneself in France and worldwide'' (''Les Sectes, <U+00C9>tat d'urgence <U+2014> Mieux les conna<U+00EE>tre, mieux s'en d<U+00E9>fendre en France et dans le monde)'', published by the [[Centre contre les manipulations mentales|Centre Roger Ikor]],<ref>[[#Ikor|Ikor, 1995]], pp. 45,46.</ref> and others.<ref>[[#Lallemand|Lallemand, 1994]], pp. 45<U+2014>49.</ref><ref>{{cite book |title=Les Nouvelles Sectes |first=Alain |last=Woodrow |publisher=<U+00C9>ditions du Seuil |year=1977 |language=French |pages=52,53 |isbn=2-02-005971-1}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |title=Les Sectes <U+00E0> l'assaut de la sant<U+00E9> <U+2014> Le pluralisme th<U+00E9>rapeutique en danger |first=Paul |last=Ari<U+00E8>s |year=2000 |publisher=Golias |place=France |language=French |pages=49,50 |isbn=2-911453-89-1}}</ref> In the early 2000s, membership of an antoinist mother in [[Valenciennes]] was used by her former husband to remove from her the custody of their son; the decision received attention from media and was criticized by the French sociologist R<U+00E9>gis Dericquebourg as being unjustified.<ref>{{cite web |title=Antoinism: Divorce and Cults |url=http://wwrn.org/articles/14040/?&place=france&section=other-nrms |author=[[Human Rights Without Frontiers]] |publisher=Worldwide Religious News |date=7 December 2001 |accessdate=12 April 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |title=La religion, une anomalie r<U+00E9>publicaine? |chapter=Chapitre 2: Les enfants dans la tourmente "sectaire" |first=Dominique |last=Kounkou |publisher=L'Harmattan |year=2003 |pages=93<U+2014>102 |language=French |isbn=2-7475-4094-4}}</ref><ref>{{cite video |people=R<U+00E9>gis Dericquebourg |title=L'interview de R<U+00E9>gis Dericquebourg |url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54F0i1vYjCA |date=2006 |medium= |language=French |trans_title=Interview of Regis Dericquebourg |publisher=Centre d'Information et de Conseil des Nouvelles Spiritualit<U+00E9>s |accessdate=12 April 2011 |time=18:10}}</ref>

When heard by the Belgian commission on cults, philosopher Luc Nefontaine said that "the establishment of a directory of cult movements (...) seems to him dangerous, because it would also give a bad image of quite honourable organizations such as (...) Antoinism".<ref>{{Cite web|title=Rapport fait au nom de la Commission d'Enqu<U+00EA>te par MM.

It has both magical and ethical dimensions.<ref>[[#Masse|Mass<U+00E9>, 2002]], p. 76.</ref>

Although it does not refer directly to the Gospel, Antoinism is often considered a [[Christianity|Christian]] based [[new religious movement]].<ref name="Quid"/><ref>{{cite book |title=Guide des Soci<U+00E9>t<U+00E9>s Secr<U+00E8>tes et des Sectes |first=Jean-Pierre |last=Bayard |year=2004 |publisher=Nouvelle Imprimerie Labollery |place=France |pages=249,250 |language=French |isbn=2-84898-039-7}}</ref> In 1970, British sociologist [[Bryan Wilson]] classified Antoinism in the category of "[[Thaumaturgy|thaumaturgical]] sects".<ref>{{cite book |title=Les sectes religieuses |first=Bryan |last=Wilson |authorlink=Bryan Wilson |publisher=Hachette |place=Paris |date=1970 |language=French |page=174}}</ref> Secretary of the French episcopate for the study of cults and new religious movements [[Jean Vernette]] also deemed the group a "healer church" and "a new religion of spiritualism, theosophy and elements of Christianity".<ref>{{cite book |title=Dictionnaire des groupes religieux aujourd'hui (religions - <U+00E9>glises - sectes - nouveaux mouvements religieux - mouvements spiritualistes) |first1=Jean |last=Vernette |authorlink1=Jean Vernette |first2=Claire |last2=Moncelon |publisher=Presses Universitaires de France |year=2001 |page=18 |language=French |isbn=978-2130520269}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |title=Les Sectes |first=Jean |last=Vernette |authorlink=Jean Vernette |publisher=Presses Universitaires de France |year=2002 |place=Paris |pages=55,56 |language=French |isbn=2-13-052434-6}}</ref> A Belgian Protestant periodical said that the group, although officially listed as a cult at a time, was "rather a philosophical and religious movement".<ref>{{cite journal |title=Sectes d'hier et d'aujourd'hui (13) - Le culte antoiniste |url=http://www.lambert-le-begue.be/attachments/File/PLf__vrier2011_finalis__.pdf |journal=Le Protestant Li<U+00E9>geois |first=Ren<U+00E9> |last=Giltay |date=February 2011 |publisher=<U+00C9>glise Protestante Unie de Belgique |place=Li<U+00E8>ge |pages=6<U+2014>9 |language=French |format=pdf |accessdate=11 June 2011}}</ref> In an encyclopedia about sects, the journalist Xavier Pasquini qualified Antoinism a "true [[theosophical]] religion", and stated that it "does not ask for money from its followers, and does not practice excessive indoctrination".<ref>{{cite book |title=Encyclop<U+00E9>die des sectes dans le monde |first1=Xavier |last1=Pasquini |first2=Christian |last2=Plume |publisher=Henri Veyrier |place=Alen<U+00E7>on |year=1984 |language=French |page=37 |isbn=2-85199-327-5}}</ref>

==Splinter groups==
When Antoine was alive, a minor split group was led in [[Verviers]] by a man named Jousselin.<ref>[[#Vivier|Vivier, 1989]], p. 373.</ref> A more important schism from Antoinism was initied by Pierre Dor (born 15 May 1862, Mons-Crotteux), Louis Antoine's nephew, and was named "Dorism". He first participated in the spiritualist circle of his uncle, "The Vine Growers of the Lord", but decided to splinter off, as he believed he had himself [[gifts of healing]]. He tried to heal sufferers, but did not achieve success and returned to the group of his uncle. However, he accompanied one of his patients in Russia, where he enjoyed success since he healed about 7,000 people per week,<ref>[[#Dericquebourg|Dericquebourg, 1993]], p. 31.</ref> but came back to Belgium after complaints from doctors. In Roux-Wilbeauroux, he built a hall called "The Moral School" ("L'<U+00C9>cole Morale") where he healed the sick and dispensed roughly the same teachings as that of his uncle.<ref name="Cecius">{{cite web |title=L'antoinisme et le dorisme |url=http://prolib.net/pierre_bailleux/libresens/208.014.antoinisme.htm |first=Jacques |last=Cecius |publisher=Profils de libert<U+00E9>s |location=Spa |date=2 July 2007 |language=French |accessdate=10 September 2010}}</ref> He explained his theory in two books respectively published in 1912 and 1913, entitled ''Catechism of the Restoration of the Soul'' (''Cat<U+00E9>chisme de la restauration de l'<U+00E2>me'') and ''Christ Speaks Again'' (''Le Christ parle <U+00E0> nouveau'') <U+2014> as he identified himself to Jesus Christ, and Antoine to [[John the Baptist]] <U+2014> which Debouxhtay considered as a potential [[plagiarism]] of Antoine's writings.<ref>[[#Debouxhtay|Debouxhtay, 1945]], p. 15.</ref> Dor encouraged a diet of [[vegetable]]s boiled in water and [[chastity]] before marriage. In 1916, he was convicted of illegally practicing the healing art. Thereafter, he moved to [[Uccle]], and his movement disappeared following his death on 5 March 1947.<ref name="Cecius"/> As Antoinism, Dorism was criticized by some Catholic clergy members.<ref>{{cite book |title=L'Antoinisme ou la religion bizarre d'un faux proph<U+00E8>te |author=Abb<U+00E9> Brabant |publisher=<U+00C9>ditions Rex |place=Louvain |year=1931 |chapter=Appendice: Le Dorisme |language=French}}</ref>
