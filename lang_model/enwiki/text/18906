'''Skycamefalling''' are a [[metalcore]] band from [[Long Island]], [[New York]], USA. Formed in 1996, the band released three EPs and one full-length album from 1996-2003. After going through several lineup changes (mainly several drummers and bassists), the band eventually split up in 2003. After a seven-year break, four of the five founding members reformed the band in 2010.

==History==
''Skycamefalling'' formed in 1996 and self-released a four-song demo cassette entitled "''A Penny For Your Confessions''". The demo went on to sell well over one thousand demos and the band was contacted by Belgium's Good Life Recordings shortly after. The band entered Brass Giraffe studios in [[New York City]] sometime in 1998 to begin recording their label debut EP. "''To Forever Embrace The Sun''" was released in 1999 and the band quickly began establishing a fanbase both in the United States as well as Europe. By the year 2000, their relationship with Good Life quickly soured and ''Skycamefalling'' signed with New Jersey label [[Ferret Music]]. ''10.21'', the band's only full-length album, was released in 2001 and was well received by both fans and critics. Touring relentlessly for nearly two years as well as a brief stint on Warped Tour, ''Skycamefalling'' decided to go their separate ways. The band played two final [[Long Island]] shows at the Local Seven (one under the name "''Embrace The Sun''" in which the band played their debut EP from start to finish) as well as their last show at [[Hellfest (punk festival)|Hellfest]] in the summer of 2003. Their final self-titled EP left their fans with two final songs (''Thera'' and ''The Elephant Graveyard''). These tracks were early, rough recordings for songs that were to be on ''10.21'' but since the band was breaking up, they gave Ferret Music the rights to release the songs because of left-over debt that the band had yet to fulfill. From 2003-2008 Cameron Keym formed and was guitarist/keyboardist for the band ''[[The Sleeping]]'' along with Sal Mignano on Bass and Joe Zizzo on Drums. Christopher Tzompanakis, Matt Woisin, and Rob Holohan formed ''Farewell Tide'' which disbanded shortly after formation. Christopher Tzompanakis went on to briefly front ''Spectators'' before reforming ''Farewell Tide'' in mid-2009 with Brian Parker, ''Skycamefalling'''s original drummer.  In 2011 Christopher Tzompanakis joined the Long Island band Divider.  

Four of the bands founding members, with the exception of John Clerkin, reunited the band in early 2010. The reunion show was supposed to take place at the Long Island Fest 2010. However, just before the show, the guitarist injured his hand and the band was forced to postpone the reunion show. ''Skycamefalling'' and Long Island Fest issued an apology to fans and stated intentions to play the show later in 2010.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://longislandfest.blogspot.com/2010/05/skycamefalling-will-not-be-playing-li.html|publisher=Blogspot|author=long island fest 2010|title=Skycamefalling will not be playing LI Fest|date=May 13, 2010|accessdate=September 28, 2010}}</ref>

The band did however reform, with the lineup mentioned above, at Long Island Fest 2011 and went on to perform at Webster Hall in July 2011 with Harvest & Burnt By The Sun. They later announced a tenth anniversary weekend of their album 10.21 with Long Island's Incendiary in October 2011. The band played 10.21 in its entirely on 10/21/2011 along with shows in both Poughkeepsie, NY & Warren, NJ.
