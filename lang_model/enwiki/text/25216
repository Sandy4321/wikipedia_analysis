==Units==
===118th Airlift Wing===

The 118th is based out of Berry Field Air National Guard Base at [[Nashville International Airport]] in [[Nashville, Tennessee]]. The 118th's history goes back to the 1920s when veteran fliers of the [[First World War]] organized their own unit of the [[Tennessee National Guard]]. In 1921, the unit received official federal status as the 136th Air Observation Squadron and was issued 4 [[JN_Jenny|Curtiss JN-6]] and one [[DeHavilland DH-4]] aircraft, and became the first official aviation unit of the Tennessee National Guard.

By 1938th the squadron had moved to its present location at Berry Field, what would become known as Nashville International Airport.  By World War 2, the unit had changed names to the 105th Observation squadron, and its pilots would provide their experience flying many different types of aircraft in dozens of units throughout the war.  By the 1950s, the unit has reorganized as the 118th Composite Wing with headquarters at Berry Field.

In 1961 the wing converted to an airlift mission with the acquisition of [[C-97 Stratofreighter]] aircraft.  In 1971 the wing first began using the C-130 airframe. In 1992 the wing took on its present designation as the 118th Airlift Wing and was attached to the [[8th Air Force]], [[Air Combat Command]] in 1993.   

In 2005 the BRAC committee recommended to the [[Department of Defense]] to redistribute the [[C-130H]] aircraft to the [[Illinois Air National Guard]] and the [[Kentucky Air National Guard]].  The fire fighting and aerial port units would move to Memphis and the Aeromedical Squadron would be transferred to [[NAS Fort Worth]], and all other units would remain in Nashville.<ref>http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/agency/usaf/118aw.htm</ref>

===164th Airlift Wing===

The 164th Airlift Wing began life in 1946 as the 155th FS flying F-15 Mustang piston engine fighters.  By 1961 the unit was flying [[C-97]] cargo aircraft in vital support missions in conflicts all over the world, a mission that the 164th continues today.  In 1967, the 164th completed its final flight of a [[C-124]] and switched to the more modern [[C-130]] turboprop cargo aircraft.  All C-130As were retired in 1992, and the 164th was given newer [[C-141]] aircraft.  The 164th was one of the last units to operate the venerable C-141, using it until it was finally retired in 2004 and replaced with the massive [[C-5 Galaxy|C-5A]].

The 164th is based out of [[Memphis International Airport]] in [[Memphis, Tennessee]].

===134th Air Refueling Wing===
The 134th Air Refueling Wing is based out of McGhee Tyson Air National Guard Base at [[McGhee Tyson Airport|Knoxville McGhee Tyson Airport]]. In 1952, the 164ths home base, McGhee Tyson Air National Guard Base was established as Mcghee Tyson Air Force Base in order to protect vital strategic assets in the Knoxville area, including [[Oak Ridge National Laboratory]], the [[Alcoa]] [[aluminum]] plants in neighboring [[Alcoa, TN]], and the system of [[TVA]] dams and power production facilities in the region.<ref>http://www.tnknox.ang.af.mil/</ref> 

In 1957 the base transferred hands to the Tennessee Air National Guard and was given [[F-86 Sabre]] interceptors.  The unit then updated to [[F-104 Starfighter]]s, and then to retired USAF [[F-102 Delta Dagger]] interceptors when the unit's F-104's were recalled by the active duty Air Force.  In 1964 the 134th recieved [[KC-97]] mid air refueling aircraft and was put under the authority of the Tactical Air Command, thus beginning its air refueling mission that it continues to this day.  In 1976 the unit was placed under the Strategic Air Command and given newer [[KC-135|KC-135A]] aircraft.

Unlike the 118th Airlift Wing, the 134th ARW was positively effected by the BRAC commission.  The unit was granted by the Air Force on the recommendation of the BRAC commission a total of 12 newer KC-135R aircraft and the retiring of the 8 older KC-135E currently operated by the wing.<ref>http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/agency/usaf/134arw.htm</ref>
