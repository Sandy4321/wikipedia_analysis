The '''Great Auk''' (''Pinguinus impennis'') was a large, flightless bird of the [[auk|alcid]] family that became [[Extinction|extinct]] in the mid-19th century. It was the only modern [[species]] in the genus '''''Pinguinus''''', a group of [[bird]]s that formerly included one other species of flightless giant [[auk]] from the [[Atlantic Ocean]] region. It bred on rocky, isolated islands with easy access to the ocean and a plentiful food supply, a rarity in nature that provided only a few breeding sites for the auks. When not breeding, the auks spent their time foraging in the waters of the [[North Atlantic]], ranging as far south as [[New England]] and northern Spain through Canada, Greenland, Iceland, the Faroe Islands, Norway, Ireland, and Great Britain.

The Great Auk was {{convert|75|to|85|cm|in}} tall and weighed around {{convert|5|kg|lb}}, making it the largest member of the alcid family. It had a black back and a white belly. The black [[beak]] was heavy and hooked with grooves on its surface. During summer, the Great Auk had a white patch over each eye. During winter, the auk lost this patch, instead developing a white band stretching between the eyes. The wings were only {{convert|15|cm|in}} long, rendering the bird flightless. Instead, the auk was a powerful swimmer, a trait that it used in hunting. Its favourite prey were fish, including [[Atlantic Menhaden]] and [[Capelin]], and [[crustaceans]]. Although agile in the water, it was clumsy on land. Great Auk pairs mated for life. They nested in extremely dense and social colonies, laying one egg on bare rock. The egg was white with variable brown streaking. Both parents incubated for about six weeks before their young hatched. The young auks left the nest site after two or three weeks and the parents continued to care for them.

Humans had hunted the Great Auk for more than 100,000 years. It was an important part of many Native American cultures which coexisted with the bird, both as a food source and as a symbolic item. Many [[Maritime Archaic]] people were buried with Great Auk bones, and one was buried covered in over 200 auk beaks, which are assumed to have been part of a cloak made of their skins. Early European explorers to the Americas used the auk as a convenient food source or as fishing bait, reducing its numbers. The bird's down was in high demand in Europe, a factor which largely eliminated the European populations by the mid-16th century. Scientists soon began to realize that the Great Auk was disappearing and it became the beneficiary of many early environmental laws, but this proved not to be enough. Its growing rarity increased interest from European museums and private collectors in obtaining skins and eggs of the bird. On 3 July 1844, the last two confirmed specimens were killed on [[Eldey]], off the coast of Iceland, which also eliminated the last known breeding attempt. There are unconfirmed later reports of roaming individuals being seen or caught. A record of a bird in 1852 is considered by some to be the last sighting of the species. The Great Auk is mentioned in a number of novels and the scientific journal of the [[American Ornithologists' Union]] is named ''[[The Auk]]'' in honour of this bird.

==Taxonomy and evolution==

Analysis of [[mtDNA]] [[DNA sequence|sequences]] has confirmed [[Morphology (biology)|morphological]] and [[biogeography|biogeographical]] studies suggesting that the [[Razorbill]] is the Great Auk's closest living relative.<ref name="Moum">{{cite journal | last = Moum | first = Truls| coauthors = Arnason, Ulfur & <U+00C1>rnason, Einar | title = Mitochondrial DNA sequence evolution and phylogeny of the Atlantic Alcidae, including the extinct Great Auk (''Pinguinus impennis'') | journal = Molecular Biology and Evolution | volume = 19 | issue = 9 | pages = 1434<U+2013>1439 | year = 2002| publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|location=Oxford| url = http://mbe.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/reprint/19/9/1434.pdf| accessdate = 2009-05-08 | pmid = 12200471 | doi = 10.1093/oxfordjournals.molbev.a004206}}</ref> The Great Auk was also closely related to the [[Little Auk]] (Dovekie), which underwent a radically different evolution compared to ''Pinguinus''. Due to its outward similarity to the Razorbill (apart from flightlessness and size), the Great Auk was often placed in the genus ''Alca'', following Linnaeus.

The fossil record (especially the [[sister species]] ''Pinguinus alfrednewtoni'') and molecular evidence show that the three genera, while closely related, diverged soon after their common ancestor, a bird probably similar to a stout [[Xantus's Murrelet]], had spread to the coasts of the Atlantic. By that time the murres, or Atlantic [[guillemot]]s, had apparently already split from the other Atlantic alcids. Razorbill-like birds were common in the Atlantic during the [[Pliocene]], but the evolution of the Little Auk is sparsely documented.<ref name="Moum"/> The molecular data are compatible with either view, but the weight of evidence suggests placing the Great Auk in a distinct genus.<ref name="Moum"/> Some ornithologists still feel it is more appropriate to retain the species in the genus ''Alca'', however.<ref>{{cite book|last=Fuller|first=Errol|author-link=Errol Fuller |title=The Great Auk|publisher=Privately Published|location=Southborough, Kent, UK|year=1999|edition=illustrated|page=401|isbn=0-9533553-0-6}}</ref> The Great Auk was not closely related to the other extinct genera of flightless alcids, ''[[Mancalla]]'', ''[[Praemancalla]]'', and ''[[Alcodes]]''.<ref name="BNASystematics"/>

===Etymology===
The Great Auk was one of the 4400 animal species originally described by [[Carolus Linnaeus]] in his 18th century work, ''[[Systema Naturae]]'', in which it was named ''Alca impennis''.<ref>{{cite book | last=Linnaeus | first=C | authorlink=Carolus Linnaeus | title=Systema naturae per regna tria naturae, secundum classes, ordines, genera, species, cum characteribus, differentiis, synonymis, locis.

[[File:Wormius' Great Auk.jpg|thumb|upright|Only known illustration of a Great Auk drawn from life, [[Ole Worm]]'s pet received from the Faroe Islands]]
The [[Basque language|Basque]] name for the Great Auk is ''arponaz'', meaning "spearbill". Its early [[French language|French]] name was ''apponatz''. The [[Norsemen|Norse]] called the Great Auk ''geirfugl'', which means "spearbird". This has led to an alternative English common name for the bird, "garefowl" or "gairfowl".<ref name="Cokinos333">Cokinos 2000, p. 333</ref> The [[Inuit]] name for the Great Auk was ''isarukitsck'', which meant "little wing".<ref name="Cokinos314"/> The word "Penguin" first appears in the 16th century as a synonym for "Great Auk."<ref name = "CNRTL" >{{cite web|url=http://www.cnrtl.fr/etymologie/pingouin |title=PINGOUIN : Etymologie de PINGOUIN |publisher=Centre National de Ressources Textuelles et Lexicales|accessdate=2010-01-25}}</ref> It may be derived from the [[Welsh language|Welsh]] ''pen gwyn'' "white head", although the etymology is debated. When European explorers discovered what are today known as [[penguin]]s in the Southern Hemisphere, they noticed their [[convergent evolution|similar appearance]] to the Great Auk and named them after this bird, although they are not related.<ref name="Crofford10">Crofford 1989, p. 10</ref>

===Extinction===
[[File:Edley close.jpg|thumb|left|Photograph of [[Eldey]], last refuge of the Great Auk]]
The [[Little Ice Age]] may have reduced the population of the Great Auk by exposing more of their breeding islands to predation by Polar Bears, but massive exploitation for their down drastically reduced the population.<ref name="BNADemography"/> By the mid-16th century, the nesting colonies along the European side of the Atlantic were nearly all eliminated by humans killing this bird for its down, which was used to make pillows.<ref name="Crofford40">Crofford 1989, p. 40</ref> In 1553, the auk received its first official protection, and in 1794 Great Britain banned the killing of this species for its feathers.<ref name="Cokinos330">Cokinos 2000, p. 330</ref> In [[St. John's, Newfoundland and Labrador|St. John's]], individuals violating a 1775 law banning hunting the Great Auk for its feathers or eggs were publicly flogged, though hunting for use as fishing bait was still permitted.<ref name="BNAConservation"/> On the North American side, [[eider]] down was initially preferred, but once the eiders were nearly driven to extinction in the 1770s, down collectors switched to the auk at the same time that hunting for food, fishing bait, and oil decreased.<ref name="BNAConservation"/><ref name="Cokinos329">Cokinos 2000, p. 329</ref> The Great Auk had disappeared from Funk Island by 1800, and an account by Aaron Thomas of [[HMS Boston (1762)|HMS ''Boston'']] from 1794 described how the bird had been systematically slaughtered until then:
{{imagequote2|If you come for their Feathers you do not give yourself the trouble of killing them, but lay hold of one and pluck the best of the Feathers. You then turn the poor Penguin adrift, with his skin half naked and torn off, to perish at his leasure. This is not a very humane method but it is the common practize. While you abide on this island you are in the constant practize of horrid cruelties for you not only skin them Alive, but you burn them Alive also to cook their Bodies with. You take a kettle with you into which you put a Penguin or two, you kindle a fire under it, and this fire is absolutely made of the unfortunate Penguins themselves. Their bodys being oily soon produce a Flame; there is no wood on the island.<ref>Aaron Thomas, 1794, in Murray, 1968</ref>}}
[[File:Grote alk -KBIN-.jpg|upright|thumb|Specimen no. 3 in [[Brussels]], which could be one of the two last birds killed on Eldey in 1844]]
With its increasing rarity, specimens of the Great Auk and its eggs became collectible and highly prized by rich Europeans, and the loss of a large number of its eggs to collection contributed to the demise of the species. Eggers, individuals who visited the nesting sites of the Great Auk to collect their eggs, quickly realized that the birds did not all lay their eggs on the same day, so they could make return visits to the same breeding colony. Eggers only collected eggs without embryos growing inside of them and typically discarded the eggs with embryos.<ref name="Crofford35"/>

It was on the islet of [[Stac an Armin]], [[St Kilda, Scotland]], in July 1840, that the last Great Auk seen in the British Isles was caught and killed.<ref>{{cite book | last = Rackwitz | first = Martin| title = Travels to Terra Incognita: The Scottish Highlands and Hebrides in Early Modern Travellers' Accounts C. 1600 to 1800 | publisher = Waxmann Verlag | year = 2007 | location =  | page = 347| isbn = 978-3-8309-1699-4}}</ref> Three men from St Kilda caught a single "garefowl", noticing its little wings and the large white spot on its head.

The last colony of Great Auks lived on [[Geirfuglasker]] (the "Great Auk Rock") off Iceland. This islet was a volcanic rock surrounded by cliffs which made it inaccessible to humans, but in 1830 the islet submerged after a volcanic eruption, and the birds moved to the nearby island of [[Eldey]], which was accessible from a single side. When the colony was initially discovered in 1835, nearly fifty birds were present. Museums, desiring the skins of the auk for preservation and display, quickly began collecting birds from the colony.<ref name="Crofford43">Crofford 1989, p. 43</ref> The last pair, found incubating an egg, was killed there on 3 July 1844, on request from a merchant who wanted specimens, with J<U+00F3>n Brandsson and Sigur<U+00F0>ur <U+00CD>sleifsson strangling the adults and Ketill Ketilsson smashing the egg with his boot.<ref name="EllisNTB">{{cite book| last = Ellis| first = Richard| authorlink = Richard Ellis (biologist) | title = No Turning Back: The Life and Death of Animal Species| publisher = [[Harper Perennial]] | year = 2004| location = New York| page = 160| isbn =0-06-055804-0 }}</ref> Great Auk specialist [[John Wolley]] interviewed the two men who killed the last birds<ref>{{cite journal|title=Abstract of Mr. J.

Today, 78 skins of the Great Auk remain mostly in museum collections, along with around 75 eggs and 24 complete skeletons. All but four of the surviving skins are in summer plumage, and only two of these are immature. No hatchling specimens exist.

Following the bird's extinction, remains of the Great Auk increased dramatically in value, and auctions of specimens created intense interest in [[Victorian era|Victorian]] Britain, where 15 specimens are now located, the largest number of any country.<ref name="Fuller Auk"/> A specimen was bought in 1971 by the Icelandic Museum of National History for the sum of <U+00A3>9000, which placed it in the [[Guinness Book of Records]] as the most expensive stuffed bird ever sold.<ref>Guinness Book of Records 1972</ref> The price of its eggs sometimes reached up to 11 times the amount earned by a skilled worker in a year.<ref name="Cokinos331"/> The present whereabouts of six of the eggs are unknown, and several other eggs have been accidentally destroyed.
