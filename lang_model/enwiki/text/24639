The term '''indirect tax''' has more than one meaning.

In the colloquial sense, an indirect tax (such as [[sales tax]], [[value added tax]] (VAT), or [[goods and services tax]] (GST)) is a [[tax]] collected by an intermediary (such as a retail store) from the person who bears the ultimate economic burden of the tax (such as the customer). The intermediary later files a tax return and forwards the tax proceeds to [[government]] with the return. In this sense, the term indirect tax is contrasted with a direct tax which is collected directly by government from the persons (legal or natural) on which it is imposed.

The term indirect tax has a different meaning for U.S. constitutional law purposes. See [[Direct tax]]; see also [[Excise]].

In the early years of the United States, there was strong opposition to the federal government levying direct taxes.  As a result, the government resorted to tariffs, an indirect tax.
