==History==
Limited archaeological studies and discoveries indicate 6,000 years of tribal residence in Ilam. Historical evidence indicates that Ilam province was part of the ancient [[Elamite Empire]].

In Elamite and Babylonian inscriptions, Ilam is called Alamto or Alam which means "mountains" or "the country of sunrise". It was also part of the [[Achaemenid dynasty|Achaemenid Empire]]. Existence of numerous historical vestiges in Lurestan and Ilam provinces belonging to the [[Sassanid]] period indicates the specific importance of the region in that time. 

In the late 11th century, Kurdish tribes governed the region till the early 13th century. 

In 1930, in the division of the country, Ilam became a part of [[Kermanshah]] province, only later to become a province by itself. Ilam is still a tribal province in many ways, but in recent years the tribal relations have changed  drastically.

==Ilam today==

During the [[Iran-Iraq war]], Ilam province took a heavy pounding, and Iraq's intense bombings left no economic infrastructure for the province. Ilam has thus been one of Iran's more undeveloped provinces. Ilam's unemployment rate was 19.9% in 2003.

Only in recent years has the central government began investing in advanced industries like Petrochemical facilities with Japanese help, in Ilam. Ilam also has a bright future in the tourist sector, with 174 historical sites listed under [[Iran's Cultural Heritage Organization]], though it also remains undeveloped.
