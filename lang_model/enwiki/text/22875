Created by character designer [[Tetsuya Nomura]], he has since appeared in the [[Computer-generated imagery|CGI]] film sequel, ''[[Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children]]'' as well as other games and media in the ''[[Compilation of Final Fantasy VII]]'' series. As of ''Advent Children'', Barret is voiced by [[Masahiro Kobayashi]] in Japanese and [[Beau Billingslea]] in English localizations.<ref name="reunion45"/><ref>{{cite web |url=http://allgame.com/game.php?id=47278&tab=credits |title=Dirge of Cerberus: Final Fantasy VII Credits |work=[[Allgame]] |publisher=[[All Media Guide]] |accessdate=2009-07-01}}</ref>

Barret is first introduced in ''Final Fantasy VII'' as an [[Eco-terrorism|eco-terrorist]], leading the group [[Characters of the Final Fantasy VII series#AVALANCHE|AVALANCHE]] to bomb [[Gaia (Final Fantasy VII)#Mako|Mako]] reactors in the fictional city of Midgar, so as to avenge the losses dealt him by the [[megacorporation]] [[Gaia (Final Fantasy VII)#Shinra Electric Power Company|Shinra]], the Planet's ''[[de facto]]'' [[world government]], who operate under the pretense of saving the Planet. As the story progresses, Barret re-examines his efforts and focuses on pursuing the villain [[Sephiroth (Final Fantasy)|Sephiroth]] in an effort to protect the Planet and the future of his adopted daughter, [[Characters of the Final Fantasy VII series#Marlene Wallace|Marlene]]. Elements of the ''Compilation of Final Fantasy VII'' would later expand upon his character, detailing the character's history before and after the events of the original game.

The first [[black people|black]] playable character in the ''[[Final Fantasy]]'' series, Barret's appearance and sometimes profane speech has been heavily compared to that of actor [[Mr. T]], earning much praise, but also a great deal of criticism and accusations of [[racism]].

==Conception and design==
Designed by Tetsuya Nomura, Barret was present in ''Final Fantasy VII'' from its early development. Initially, the game was to have only three playable characters, with Barret one of those three,<ref name="egm"/> along with the [[protagonist]] [[Cloud Strife]] and the [[hero]]ine [[Aerith Gainsborough]].<ref>{{cite book |title=Final Fantasy VII 10th Anniversary Ultimania (Revised Edition) |year=2009 |isbn=978-4-7575-2560-3 |language=Japanese | publisher=Square-Enix |pages=8<U+2013>13}}</ref> During a phone call to project director [[Yoshinori Kitase]], it was suggested that at some point in the game, one of the main characters should die, and after much discussion as to whether it should be Barret or Aerith, the producers chose Aerith, as they felt Barret's death would be "too obvious."<ref name="egm">{{cite journal| title=Interivew with Yoshinori Kitase and Tetsuya Nomura |issue=196 |month=October |year=2005 |url = http://www.ff7citadel.com/press/int_egm.shtml| journal = [[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]| accessdate = 2007-10-09| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20071011164522/http://ff7citadel.com/press/int_egm.shtml| archivedate= 11 October 2007 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>

Barret's name is a Japanese [[transliteration]] of the English word "Bullet",<ref name="kaitai">{{Cite book | year=1997 | editor=Famitsu | title=Final Fantasy VII Kaitai Shinsho | page=10 | language=Japanese | publisher=Famitsu | isbn=4-7577-0098-9}}</ref> and he was developed with the "[[Final Fantasy character jobs#Hunter|Gunner]]" [[character class]] in mind.<ref name="p518">{{Cite book | year=2005 | editor=Studio BentStuff | title=Final Fantasy VII Ultimania <U+03A9> | language=Japanese | publisher=Square-Enix | isbn=4-7575-1520-0 | page=518}}</ref> Standing 6&nbsp;feet 5&nbsp;inches (197&nbsp;cm) tall,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://na.square-enix.com/games/ff7/barret-char.html |title=Character Profiles "Barret" |publisher=[[Square Enix]] |accessdate=2009-06-30}}</ref><ref name="p17"/> he is the first black playable character in the series,<ref name="parish"/> and has a [[high and tight]] haircut and full beard, and an earring in his left ear.

When developing ''Advent Children'', Nomura stated that because of the comparisons between Barret's original design and Mr. T, they decided to take it in a different direction for the film, implementing co-director Takeshi Nozue's suggestion to give him [[cornrows]] for his hair, while Nomura designed his face. Artist [[Yusuke Naora]] influenced the design as well, developing his attire, which originally consisted of white [[overall]]s, before instead having him wear him a down vest.<ref name="reunion44">{{Cite book | year=2006 | editor=SoftBank | title=Final Fantasy VII Advent Children: Reunion Files | language=Japanese/English | publisher=Square-Enix | isbn= 4-7973-3498-3| page=44}}</ref> Barret's arm tattoo was changed as well, although it retained the "skull and fire" motif of the original.<ref name="reunion45">{{Cite book | year=2006 | editor=SoftBank | title=Final Fantasy VII Advent Children: Reunion Files | language=Japanese/English | publisher=Square-Enix | isbn= 4-7973-3498-3| page=45}}</ref> Other aspects of his design included the loss of the metal bands around his body, a white sleeve extending from the middle of his right forearm to his elbow fastened by straps, a black band on his left forearm surrounded by a pink string and bow, and a [[fishnet]] shirt that ends in torn fibers below his waist. The dog tags were altered to a bullet and medallion supported by a chain around his neck, and three rings covered his left hand. His Gimmick Arm was modified into a robotic [[Prosthesis|prosthetic hand]], developed by Nomura, with the only guideline being "a huge, over-the-top gun that transforms in a huge, over-the-top way." Nozue stated that these specifics made it difficult to work with, and decided to conceal the hand's transformation sequence into the gun as much as possible.<ref name="reunion44"/>

When choosing a voice actor for the film, Nomura was initially unsure of whether to have [[Masahiro Kobayashi]] do the role of Barret or another character, [[Characters of the Final Fantasy VII series#Kadaj, Loz and Yazoo|Loz]]. Kobayashi described his performance as treating Barret as "unrefined [...] but also dependable and unique," trying to keep his "upbeat character and good outlook in mind." He tried to give him a booming, confident sounding voice, though at times was instructed to "take it up a notch."<ref name="reunion45"/>

==Appearances==
===''Final Fantasy VII''===
First seen in ''Final Fantasy VII'' in 1997, Barret is introduced as the leader of the eco-terrorist organization AVALANCHE. Situated in city of Midgar, his group opposes the ruling company, Shinra, and their use of "Mako" energy as a power source, believing it to be killing the Planet. To this end, AVALANCHE bombs their Mako reactors, with the specific goal of saving the Planet.<ref name="past"/> When the game begins, they have just hired the [[mercenary]] Cloud Strife at the behest of his childhood friend and AVALANCHE member [[Tifa Lockhart]],<ref>{{cite book |title=Final Fantasy VII 10th Anniversary Ultimania (Revised Edition) |year=2009 |isbn=978-4-7575-2560-3 |language=Japanese | publisher=Square-Enix |pages=42<U+2013>47}}</ref> nicknaming him "Spiky" in reference to his hairstyle.<ref name="spiky"/> After the deaths of several members of AVALANCHE, Barret follows Cloud out of Midgar in pursuit of the game's villain, Sephiroth.<ref name="past">{{cite book |title=Final Fantasy VII 10th Anniversary Ultimania (Revised Edition) |year=2009 |isbn=978-4-7575-2560-3 |language=Japanese | publisher=Square-Enix |pages=52<U+2013>55}}</ref>

Along the way he encounters a former friend of his, Dyne, armed in a manner similar to him, who forces Barret to fight him. Upon Barret defeating Dyne, Dyne kills himself. Through [[Flashback (narrative)|flashbacks]] it is revealed that Shinra had wanted to build a Mako reactor in his home town of Corel, an idea Barret advocated. However due to an accident at the plant, Shinra razed the town, killing Barret's wife in the process, and causing Barret and Dyne to flee with Dyne's daughter, Marlene. Cornered, Dyne slipped off a cliff and Barret grabbed his hand, but Shinra soldier's opened fire, and destroyed Barret's and Dyne's right and left hands respectively, causing the latter to fall to his presumed death.<ref name="past"/> Barret adopted Marlene as his own daughter, had an "adapter" graft to his arm to interface with prosthetic weapons to aid in his combat against Shinra, and founded AVALANCHE.<ref name="dvd"/> Dyne's death causes him to admit his grudge with Shinra is solely for revenge, with his earlier claims of "saving the world" meant only to convince himself he was fighting for the greater good. Barret eventually shifts his goal to actually wanting to save the Planet, doing so for Marlene's sake, and he helps Cloud and his allies defeat Sephiroth to prevent the Planet's destruction.<ref name="past"/>

Early drafts of Barret's background featured subtle differences, such as Marlene intended as Barret's biological daughter, and his wife executed in front of him by a then-undecided Shinra executive. The attack on Corel was initially written to be due to the discovery of Mako energy and Shinra's desire to keep its existence a secret. His reunion with Dyne was also different, written to culminate in a duel between the two in Corel's ruins, while Cloud and the others fought investigating Shinra soldiers.<ref name="p518"/>

===''Compilation of Final Fantasy VII''===
Barret appears in ''[[Before Crisis: Final Fantasy VII]]'', a 2005 [[mobile phone]]-based prequel to the events of ''Final Fantasy VII'', which shows the events prior to Corel's destruction. He helps the game's protagonists, [[Characters of the Final Fantasy VII series#Turks|the Turks]], defend the Mako reactor, believing it to be the town's future.<ref name="past"/> It is revealed that the reactor is under attack by the original AVALANCHE group, who are the cause of Shinra's attack upon the town. Unaware of their involvement, Barret uses their ideals to form his own branch of the group.<ref name="extreme">{{Cite book | year=2005 | editor=Studio BentStuff | title=Final Fantasy VII Ultimania <U+03A9> | language=Japanese | publisher=Square-Enix | isbn=4-7575-1520-0 | page=582}}</ref>

In 2005, Barret appeared in the [[Computer-generated imagery|CGI]] film ''Advent Children'', which details the events two years after Sephiroth's defeat. Barret places Marlene in Tifa's care, travelling the world to rebuild the planet's [[infrastructure]] and find alternate power sources to replace Mako.<ref name="spiky">{{cite video| people = [[Tetsuya Nomura]] (Director)| date = 2005-09-14| title = [[Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children]]| medium = [[DVD]]| publisher = [[Square Enix]]| quote='''Barret:''' What up, fool!

He later appears in a small role in the 2006 video game ''[[Dirge of Cerberus: Final Fantasy VII]]'', set one year after ''Advent Children'', where he helps the protagonist [[Vincent Valentine]] prevent [[Gaia (Final Fantasy VII)#WEAPON|Omega WEAPON]] from destroying the planet.<ref name="past"/>

A [[novella]] entitled "Case of Barret" was released in 2007 exclusively for the "Limited Edition Collector's Set" DVD edition of ''Advent Children''. Written by [[Kazushige Nojima]] as part of the ''[[Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children#On the Way to a Smile|On the Way to a Smile]]'' series, it details the events between ''Final Fantasy VII'' and ''Advent Children'', examining Barret's reaction to his weapon and his belief that it made him a monster. At the conclusion of the story, Barret visits the creator of the adapter on his wrist and receives the prosthetic hand/gun combination seen in the film, reasoning that although he needs a hand, he also still needs a weapon to prevent others from having to fight. He then decides to return to Marlene.<ref name="dvd">{{cite video |date =20 February 2007 |title = Final Fantasy VII - Advent Children (Limited Edition Collector's Set) |medium = DVD |publisher = Square Enix |location = North America}}</ref>

==Critical reception==
Barret's comparisons to Mr. T in the media has resulted in both praise and criticism,<ref name="parish"/><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gamespot.com/features/vgs/universal/finalfantasy_hs/sec1_7.html |title=The History of Final Fantasy |accessdate=2009-06-29 |publisher=[[GameSpot]]| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20090609191948/http://www.gamespot.com/features/vgs/universal/finalfantasy_hs/sec1_7.html| archivedate= 9 June 2009 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref><ref name="IGN10"/> with most of the criticism accusing the character of serving as a negative [[Ethnic stereotype|racial stereotype]] of [[African American]]s.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.next-gen.biz/features/why-are-black-game-characters-failing-audience?page=0%252C1 |title=Why Are Black Game Characters Failing the Audience? |author=White, Darion |publisher=''[[Edge (magazine)|Edge]]'' |date=2009-02-08 |accessdate=2009-06-29}}</ref> [[IGN]] argued in favor of this point, citing his use of "stilted [[slang]]," and stating that the character stands out amongst the cast because "his dialog is written as if it was run through a broken [[African American Vernacular English|ebonic]] translator," further noting a trend in Japanese games to apply such dialogue to characters based on their skin color.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://retro.ign.com/articles/960/960091p1.html |title=A History of Insensitivity |author=Buchanan, Levi |date=2009-03-06 |accessdate=2009-06-29 |publisher=IGN}}</ref> Journalist Jeremy Parish agreed that the character was racist, although he argued that cultural gaps between Japan and the United States, plus the lack of American translators for ''Final Fantasy VII'' may have been contributing factors, arguing that the likeness between Barret and Mr. T was possibly an attempt to make a character that appealed to Americans, as the actor did.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rpgamer.com/editor/1998/q1/012498jp.html |title=Barret Racism Demonstrates Japanese/American Cultural Gap |author=Parish, Jeremy |work=[[RPGamer]] |publisher=Crave Online |accessdate=2009-06-29}}</ref>

In contrast, on [[1UP.com]], Parish argued in favor of Barret, noting that while on the surface he appeared to be the "worst kind of stereotype," he was a great character with complexity, having made "difficult decisions in his life, and agonized over his losses." Parish went further to describe Barret as the "first true [[father figure]] the [''Final Fantasy''] series had ever seen," noting his relationship with his adopted daughter.<ref name="parish">{{cite web |author=Parish, Jeremy |title=XIII Things About Final Fantasy XIII, Part VI |url=http://www.1up.com/do/blogEntry?bId=8986639&publicUserId=5379721 |publisher=[[UGO Networks]] |work=[[1UP.com]] |date=2009-04-22 |accessdate=2009-06-29}}</ref> [[RPGamer]]'s content manager Shawn Bruckner took the discussion further, arguing that claims of Barret's presentation being racist was oversimplification of the character's portrayal, and stated that while he was in some aspects a stereotype, in others, such as his compassion towards his daughter or guilt regarding his past actions, he was not. He added that Barret "shows us that a black man speaking in 'ebonics' is not something to fear," and that his portrayal was not racist, but instead the opposite.<ref>{{cite web |title=The Over-simplification of Barret's Portrayal |url=http://www.rpgamer.com/editor/1998/q1/031498sb.html |author=Bruckner, Shawn |publisher=Crave Online |work=[[RPGamer]] |accessdate=2009-06-29}}</ref>

Despite their criticism, IGN ranked Barret fourth "Top 10" best [[sidekick]] characters in video games, stating that he "took the videogame world by storm" when introduced and noting that his portrayal was also appealing, adding that his past made him a visibly loyal character.<ref name="IGN10">{{cite web |url=http://ps2.ign.com/articles/698/698916p1.html |title=Top 10 Tuesday: Best Sidekicks |author=Staff |date=2006-03-28 |publisher=IGN |accessdate=2009-06-29}}</ref> [[Joystiq]] named him one of twenty characters from the ''Final Fantasy'' franchise they wished to see in Square Enix' [[Fictional crossover|crossover]] [[fighting game]] ''[[Dissidia Final Fantasy]]'', noting a preference for his use of profanity and citing his combat abilities as easily suitable for the game.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://playstation.joystiq.com/photos/top-20/713856/ |title=Top 20 Final Fantasy supporting characters that should be in Dissidia |work=[[Joystiq]] |publisher=[[GameDaily]] |author=Staff |date=2008-03-21 |accessdate=2009-07-01}}</ref> ''[[Edge (magazine)|Edge]]'' praised Barret's introduction as something "new" in the series, citing both his use of a gun and his "distinctively black" character, and further describing him as a "pseudo-nod" to similarly armed characters, such as [[Mega Man (character)|Mega Man]] or [[Samus Aran]], who in contrast were either robots or encased in armor.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.next-gen.biz/features/week-japan-final-fantasy-special?page=2 |title=This Week in Japan: Final Fantasy VII |publisher=''[[Edge (magazine)|Edge]]'' |date=2006-03-10 |author=Staff |accessdate=2009-06-29}}</ref>
