'''Thomas Mifflin''' (January 10, 1744{{spaced ndash}}January 20, 1800) was an [[United States|American]] [[merchant]] and [[politician]] from [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|Philadelphia]], [[Pennsylvania]]. He was a [[major general]] in the [[Continental Army]] and the 1st and 3rd [[Quartermaster General]] during the [[American Revolution]], a member of the [[Pennsylvania Provincial Assembly]], a [[Continental Congress]]man from Pennsylvania, [[President of the Continental Congress]], and a delegate to the [[Philadelphia Convention|Constitutional Convention of 1787]]. He served as [[Speaker of the Pennsylvania House of Representatives|Speaker]] of the [[Pennsylvania House of Representatives]], [[Supreme Executive Council of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania#Presidents of Council|President]] of the [[Supreme Executive Council of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania|Pennsylvania Supreme Executive Council]] and the [[List of Governors of Pennsylvania|first]] [[Governor of Pennsylvania]].

==Early life==
Thomas Mifflin was born January 10, 1744 in [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]], son of John Mifflin and Elizabeth Bagnall. He graduated from the [[College of Philadelphia]] (now the [[University of Pennsylvania]]) in 1760, and joined the mercantile business of William Biddle. After returning from a trip to Europe in 1765, he established a commercial business partnership with his brother, George Mifflin, and married his cousin, Sarah Morris, on March 4, 1765.<ref name=phmc>[http://www.phmc.state.pa.us/overview.asp?secid=1 Pennsylvania Historical and Museum Commission] entry for [http://www.phmc.state.pa.us/bah/dam/governors/mifflin.asp?secid=31 Thomas Mifflin], accessed May 2, 2007.</ref> He was a member of the [[American Philosophical Society]].

==American Revolution==
Early in the [[American Revolutionary War|Revolutionary War]], Mifflin left the Continental Congress to serve in the [[Continental Army]]. Although his family had been Quakers for four generations, he was expelled from the [[Religious Society of Friends]] because his involvement with a military force contradicted his faith's [[Pacifism|pacifistic]] nature.<ref name=adherents>[http://www.adherents.com adherents.com] entry for [http://www.adherents.com/people/pm/Thomas_Mifflin.html Thomas Mifflin]</ref> He was commissioned as a [[major]], then became [[George Washington]]'s [[aide-de-camp]] and, on August 14, 1775 Washington appointed him to become the army's first [[Quartermaster general (USA)|Quartermaster General]] under order of Congress.<ref>Risch 30-31</ref>  He was good at the job, but preferred to be on the front lines. His leadership in battle gained him promotions to [[colonel]] and then [[brigadier general (United States)|brigadier general]]. He asked to be relieved of the job of Quartermaster General, but was persuaded to resume those duties because Congress was having difficulty finding a replacement.

In Congress, there was debate regarding whether a national army was more efficient or if individual states should maintain their own forces.  As a result of this debate the Congressional Board of War was created, on which Mifflin served from 1777 to 1778. He then rejoined the army but took little active role, following criticism of his service as quartermaster general. He was accused of embezzlement and welcomed an inquiry; however, one never took place. He resigned his commission<U+2014>by then, as a major general<U+2014>but Congress continued to ask his advice even after accepting his resignation.

==Political career==
Prior to Independence, Thomas Mifflin was a member of the [[Pennsylvania Provincial Assembly]] (1772&ndash;1776). He served two terms in the [[Continental Congress]] (1774&ndash;1775 and 1782&ndash;1784), including seven months (November 1783 to June 1784) as that body's [[President of the Continental Congress|presiding officer]]. His most important duty as president was to accept on behalf of Congress the commission of General [[George Washington]], who resigned in December 1783. The importance of Congress declined so precipitously after the war that Mifflin found it difficult to convince the states to send enough delegates to Congress to ratify the [[Treaty of Paris (1783)|Treaty of Paris]], which finally took place on January 14, 1784.<ref>John K. Alexander, "Mifflin, Thomas", ''American National Biography Online'', February 2000.</ref>

Mifflin was a delegate to the [[United States Constitutional Convention]] in 1787, as well as a signer of the [[United States Constitution|Constitution]].<ref name=phmc/> He served in the house of [[Pennsylvania General Assembly]] (1785&ndash;1788). He was a member of the [[Supreme Executive Council of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania]], and on November 5, 1788, he was elected [[Supreme Executive Council of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania#Presidents of Council|President of the Council]], replacing [[Benjamin Franklin]]. He was unanimously reelected to the Presidency on November 11, 1789.<ref name = minutes>''Minutes of the Supreme Executive Council of Pennsylvania, from its organization to the termination of the Revolution. [March 4, 1777 <U+2013> December 20, 1790]''. Harrisburg, Pub. by the State, 1852-53.</ref> He presided over the committee that wrote Pennsylvania's 1790 State Constitution. That document did away with the Executive Council, replacing it with a single Governor. On December 21, 1790 Mifflin became the last President of Pennsylvania and the first Governor of the Commonwealth. He held the latter office until December 17, 1799, when he was succeeded by [[Thomas McKean]]. He then returned to the state legislature, where he served until his death the following month. Mifflin decreed that no less than six towns in Pennsylvania bear his name.

==Death and legacy==
Mifflin died in [[Lancaster, Pennsylvania]], January 23, 1800.<ref>{{cite web|title=Thomas Mifflin|url=http://www.history.army.mil/books/RevWar/ss/mifflin.htm|work=Soldier-Statesmen of the Constitution|publisher=U.S. Army Center of Military History|accessdate=26 November 2013|author=Robert K. Wright, Jr.|coauthors=Morris J. MacGregor, Jr.|year=1987}}</ref>  He is buried in front of Trinity Lutheran Church in Lancaster. A Commonwealth of Pennsylvania historical marker at the church commemorates both [[Thomas Wharton Jr.|Thomas Wharton]] and Mifflin, the first and last Presidents of Pennsylvania under the [[Pennsylvania Constitution of 1776|1776 State Constitution]]. The marker, dedicated in 1975, is located on Duke Street in Lancaster.<ref name=marker>Pennsylvania State Historical Marker for [http://www.phmc.state.pa.us/bah/DOH/descriptresults.asp?secid=31&markertext=thomas+wharton&markertextsubmit=Search+by+Keywords Thomas Mifflin]</ref> It reads:

<center><blockquote>'''Holy Trinity'''

''Founded in 1730.<br/> A session for an Indian treaty was held in the original church building in 1762.<br/> The present edifice was dedicated in 1766. <br/>Here are interred the remains of Thomas Wharton (1778) and Gov. Thomas Mifflin (1800).''</center></blockquote>
