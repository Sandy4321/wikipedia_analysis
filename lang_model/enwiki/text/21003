In Gordon's hometown of Mount Vernon, there is an annual "Ben Gordon Day In The Park", which is sponsored by the city and the Mount Vernon Boys & Girls Club. Gordon hosts a basketball camp run by "Five Star Camp".<ref name="BGD">[http://www.nba.com/bulls/chat/gordon_day_chat_091606.html Ben Gordon Day Chat] URL last accessed August 26, 2006</ref> Throughout his college and NBA career, Gordon has been given [[nickname]]s including "Gentle Ben"<ref name="Bulls">[http://www.nba.com/bulls/news/gordon_interview_040715.html Bulls.com discusses Ben Gordon's nickname "Madison Square Gordon" and "Gentle Ben"] URL last accessed on July 31, 2006</ref> and "Madison Square Gordon".<ref name="Bulls" /> Gordon also has an energy drink called "BG7", named after his initials and number on his jersey.<ref name="FA1">[http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4155/is_20060518/ai_n16418496 Gordon still sippin' pretty: He has his own drink] URL last accessed December 10, 2006</ref>

==College career==
As a [[freshman]] at Connecticut, Gordon ranked second on the team in [[Score (gaming)|scoring]] (12.6 ppg), despite coming off the bench for most of the season. He hit the game winning [[Three-point field goal|3-point field goal]] against [[Villanova University|Villanova]] in the [[Big East Conference|Big East]] Tournament.<ref name="NBA%20draft%20profile">[http://www.nba.com/draft2004/profiles/BenGordon.html Ben Gordon prospect profile and college stats] URL last accessed July 31, 2006</ref> As a [[wiktionary:sophomore|sophomore]]  Gordon averaged a team-leading 19.5 points (which ranked 50th in the nation) and also led the Huskies with 156 total [[Assist (basketball)|assist]]s, which earned Gordon Second Team All-Big East honors.<ref name="NBA%20draft%20profile" />

==NBA career==
===Chicago Bulls===
[[File:Ben Gordon.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Ben Gordon signing autographs before a Chicago Bulls game.]]
Before the [[2004 NBA Draft]], Gordon thought that he would be drafted anywhere from 7th to 12th, but as the draft got closer he claimed to have an inkling that the Bulls might draft him third as they did with [[Michael Jordan]] 20 years earlier in the [[1984 NBA Draft]]. "I'm a guy who looks at the significance of numbers a lot. Before the draft, I had no idea I'd get drafted third. I thought I was going to go anywhere from 7th to 12th. As we started getting closer and I started to get an inkling that the Bulls could be a team that I could end up playing for, I started to look at the numbers. Michael Jordan was drafted by the Bulls and he was the third pick just like you."<ref name="SIinter">[http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2006/writers/andrew_lawrence/11/10/gordon.interview/ Q&A: Ben Gordon] URL last accessed November 17, 2006</ref> Gordon wore the number 4 on his [[Jersey (clothing)|jersey]] in high school and college, but has to wear the number 7 with the Bulls due to the number 4 being retired. Gordon said, "I wore No. 4 my whole career but, of course, Jerry Sloan already had that number beforehand (it has been since retired by the organization) so there wasn't much I could do about it. So all I did was just [put together] being the third pick with my old No. 4. That's why I wear No. 7."<ref name="SIinter" />

In the [[2004<U+2013>05 NBA season|2004<U+2013>05 season]], his rookie year, Gordon averaged 15.1 points, 2.6 rebounds and 1.9 assists per game while playing 24.2 minutes per game. Gordon also finished with 21 double-digit fourth quarter point performances, second to only [[LeBron James]]' 22 in the NBA.<ref name="Bullsnews">[http://www.nba.com/bulls/news/fource_0405.html Ben Gordon, Chris Duhon, Andres Nocioni and Luol Deng Bulls Fource] URL last accessed August 1, 2006</ref>  Gordon helped lead the Bulls to their first playoff appearance since the Jordan era ended in 1998.  After the season, Gordon became the first rookie in NBA history to be awarded the [[NBA Sixth Man of the Year Award|NBA Sixth Man Award]].<ref name="6th%20man%20award">[http://www.nba.com/news/gordon_050503.html Gordon named NBA's 6th man] URL last accessed July 31, 2006</ref> Gordon was also the NBA's Eastern Conference Rookie of The Month 3 times (January, February, and March),<ref name="NBA%20Bio">[http://www.nba.com/playerfile/ben_gordon/bio.html Gordon named rookie of the month for January, February, and March] URL last accessed July 31, 2006</ref> and was also voted onto the NBA All-Rookie First Team.

[[File:Ben Gordon1.jpg|right|thumb|175px|Gordon during a [[2008&ndash;09 NBA season|2008&ndash;09]] game at the [[Verizon Center]]]]
However, Gordon also had problems with turnovers (4.46 per 48 minutes; 6th in the league in 04<U+2013>05) and an overall lack of stamina in his rookie season. He remarked, "More than anything, I just want to come back [in the fall] in better shape". "A lot of this game is about conditioning and how long you can give your best performance."<ref name="Interview">[http://www.nba.com/bulls/news/gordon_050810.html Bulls.com interview with Ben Gordon] URL last accessed on July 31, 2006</ref> In his sophomore campaign ([[2005<U+2013>06 NBA season|2005<U+2013>06]]), Gordon alternated between the starting lineup and bench for the Bulls, starting 47 games (mostly in the later half of the season) while coming off of the bench for 35. The minutes Gordon played per game rose, as did his scoring and assist averages.<ref name="NBA%20stats">[http://www.nba.com/playerfile/ben_gordon/index.html?nav=page Stats and Bio] URL last accessed August 1, 2006</ref> Gordon was selected to play for the Sophomores in the [[NBA All-Star Weekend Rookie Challenge|Rookie Challenge]] held during the [[NBA All-Star Weekend]], in which he scored 17 points.<ref name="RookSoph">[http://www.nba.com/allstar2006/rookie_challenge/ Recap for 2006 Rookie Challenge game] URL last accessed July 31, 2006</ref>

On April 14, 2006, in a Bulls win over the Washington Wizards, Gordon tied the record for the most consecutive three-pointers made in a game with 9.<ref name="tiesrecord">[http://www.nba.com/bulls/news/82games_0506.html Gordon Ties Record; Bulls Get Key Win] URL last accessed December 24, 2006</ref> Gordon also revealed that he was in the process of designing an energy drink called "BG7", an allusion to his initials and jersey number, towards the end of his second season. Gordon unveiled the drink at One Sixty Blue, a restaurant co-owned by Michael Jordan. The drink is made with [[white tea]],<ref name="FA1" /> which has a very high amount of [[antioxidant]]s, and the most [[polyphenol]]s of any tea.

Gordon has scored 40 points or more in a game twice over a span of two weeks.<ref name="ESPN2-40">[http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/news/story?id=2718124 Elias Says... A daily glance inside the numbers from the world of sports] URL last accessed January 3, 2006</ref> Later on March 4, 2007, he established a career high 48 points, leading a miraculous comeback effort to win 126<U+2013>121 in overtime against the [[Milwaukee Bucks]].<ref>Yahoo! Sports, [http://sports.yahoo.com/nba/recap?gid=2007030415 Chicago 126, Milwaukee 121, OT] URL last accessed March 27, 2006</ref> Gordon accepted the Bulls' one-year qualifying offer of $6.4 million after being unable to secure the contract that he was hoping for. He was an unrestricted free agent after the [[2008<U+2013>09 NBA season|2008<U+2013>09 season]]. On December 27, 2008, Gordon passed [[Scottie Pippen]] as the Chicago Bulls' career leader in three-pointers made.

===Detroit Pistons===
According to ESPN, Gordon signed a five-year deal for $55 million with the [[Detroit Pistons]] starting with the 2009<U+2013>10 season.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/news/story?id=4301111|title=Sources: Gordon, Villanueva to Pistons|publisher=ESPN|accessdate=2009-07-02}}</ref> With the Pistons, Gordon continued his role as a high-scoring sixth-man off the bench.
