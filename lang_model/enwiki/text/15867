On 6 December 1997 a Russian Air Force [[Antonov An-124-100]], en route from [[Irkutsk Northwest Airport]] to [[Cam Ranh Air Base]], [[Kh<U+00E1>nh H<U+00F2>a Province]], [[Vietnam]], crashed in a residential area after take-off from Irkutsk-2 airport.<ref name=ASN>{{cite web|title=Accident description|url=http://aviation-safety.net/database/record.php?id=19971206-0|publisher=aviation-safety.net|accessdate=7 August 2013}}</ref> 

Leased by [[Cargotrans]] the aircraft was carrying two [[Sukhoi Su-27]] fighters for delivery to the [[Vietnam People's Air Force]] (Vietnamese: Kh<U+00F4>ng qu<U+00E2>n Nh<U+00E2>n d<U+00E2>n Vi<U+1EC7>t Nam), with a planned stopover at [[Vladivostok]].<ref name=ASN/>

Three seconds after lift-off from Runway 014, at Irkutsk, the No.3 engine [[surged]] at approximately {{convert|5|m|ft|abbr=on}} altitude. The aircraft continued to climb, but at a high angle of attack, disrupting airflow to No.1 and No.2 engines which also surged.<ref name=ASN/>

Unable to continue climbing the aircraft descended until it struck houses in Mura Street, {{convert|1600|m|mi|abbr=on}} beyond the runway end, killing all 23 on board and 45 persons on the ground.<ref name=ASN/>
