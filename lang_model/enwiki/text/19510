'''''The Protocols of Zion''''' is a 2005 [[documentary film]] by Jewish filmmaker [[Marc Levin]] about a resurgence of [[antisemitism]] in the [[United States]] in the wake of the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]].  Armed with his camera and appearing on screen along with his subjects, Levin engages in a free-for-all dialogue with [[Arab Americans]], [[Black nationalism|Black nationalists]], [[Christian evangelism|evangelists]], [[White nationalism|White nationalists]], [[Kabbalah|Kabbalist]] [[rabbi]]s, [[List of famous Holocaust survivors|Holocaust survivors]], and [[Frank Weltner]], the founder of [[Jew Watch]] web site.

Levin's film draws its inspiration from an encounter he had in a [[New York]] taxi not long after 9/11, in which his driver, an [[Egyptian people|Egyptian]] immigrant, made the claim that the [[Jews]] had been warned not to go to work at the [[World Trade Center]] on the day of the attack. He then said that "it's all written in the book," referring to ''[[The Protocols of the Elders of Zion]]'', a 1903 book purporting to disclose the Jews' master plan to rule the world. Discredited as a [[hoax]] by ''[[The Times]]'' of [[London]] in 1921,<ref>[http://reason.com/0002/ci.cf.forging.shtml Forging Protocols] by Charles Paul Freund. (Reason magazine) February 2000</ref> ''The Protocols'' provided a crucial influence on [[Hitler]]'s world views, and had fuelled hatred, violence, and ultimately [[genocide]] attempts through the first half of the twentieth century. Ads for the film show two stacks of books, visibly entitled ''Protocols of Zion,'' with smoke billowing out of the top portion of the left-hand stack. This looks much like actual pictures of the World Trade Center as the fire raged through it. The movie was made in 2005, 4 years after WTC attack.

==Reactions==
The film received fair to good reviews from American film critics.  The most common negative criticism was that although it elicited strong emotions, the film lacked focus.<ref>[http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/protocols_of_zion/ "Protocols of Zion."] ''[[Rotten Tomatoes]]''.  14 March 2007.</ref> The film had an extremely limited theatrical release (four theaters at its widest) and grossed $178,875 domestically.<ref>[http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=protocolsofzion.htm "Protocols of Zion (2005)."] ''[[Box Office Mojo]]''.  14 March 2007.</ref>
