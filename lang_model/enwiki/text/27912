The '''November 2009 Great Britain and Ireland floods''' was a weather event affecting parts of [[Great Britain]] and [[Ireland]] in mid-November 2009. The worst affected area by far was the English county of [[Cumbria]], the [[BBC]] and many other publications continuously referred to the event as the 'Cumbria Floods'.

[[European windstorm]]s bringing heavy rain and severe gales caused damage and flooding to the south of Great Britain  on 13-14 November. Unsettled weather continued across the south and later to the north. On 19<U+2013>20 November, many towns and villages in [[Cumbria]] and [[Dumfries and Galloway]] were affected.
