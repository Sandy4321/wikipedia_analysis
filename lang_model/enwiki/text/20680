The '''Green D.4''' was a four-cylinder [[watercooled]] [[inline engine (aviation)|inline]] [[piston engine]] produced by the [[Green Engine Co]] in the [[UK]] in 1909. It produced about 60&nbsp;hp (45&nbsp;kW) and played an important role in the development of British aviation before [[World War I|World&nbsp;War&nbsp;I]].

==Design==
The Green D.4 was a natural development of the [[Green C.4]], a 30-35&nbsp;hp engine used by some early aviators in the UK, such as [[Alliott Verdon Roe|Roe]] and the [[Short Brothers]]. It was an inline, watercooled 4-cylinder piston engine with characteristic Green features: cast steel single piece cylinders and cylinder heads, two valves per cylinder driven by an overhead camshaft, white metal crankshaft bearings and copper water jackets, rubber sealed to allow for differential expansion.<ref name="Gunston"/><ref name="Lumsden"/>

Increases in bore and stroke more gave the D.4 more than twice the swept volume of the C.4, and roughly doubled its power. The cast steel cylinders, individually machined inside and out, were mounted separately onto a flat sided aluminium [[crankcase]]. They were fastened down by long bolts between them, which reached into the crankcase to support the four inner [[crankshaft]] bearings. The main bearings were in the crankcase ends, and the ball race was designed to allow either [[pusher configuration|pusher]] or [[tractor configuration|tractor]] operation. A [[flywheel]] was fitted to the output shaft. Thin cylindrical copper water jackets surrounded the cylinders almost to their base, where a rubber ring, located by a circumferential groove in the cylinder, provided a sliding water seal that allowed for the differential thermal contraction of copper and steel.  Cooling water was fed to these jackets by an engine driven pump via a horizontal tube on the low right side of the engine, assuming a tractor orientation, and fed to the [[radiator]] by another tube on the top left.<ref name="Alexander"/>

A single jet [[Zenith Carburetters|Zenith]] carburettor with a remote [[float chamber]] fed a double branched [[inlet manifold]] on the right; the plugs, also set in the cylinder walls, were on the same side, below and angled to the inlets. The exhaust ports were on the left side, angled forwards. A crankshaft driven [[Robert Bosch GmbH|Bosch]] [[ignition magneto|magneto]] at the rear provided the plugs' high voltage supply. The overhead [[camshaft]] was also driven from the crankshaft, via [[worm drive|worm gears]] and a vertical shaft at the rear of the engine.  The camshaft operated the valves by [[rocker arm|rockers]] with rollers on their camshaft ends and adjusting screws at the other.<ref name="Alexander"/>

Lubricating oil was mechanically pumped through cast-in channels in the crankcase to all the crankshaft bearings. The camshaft was contained in an oil tight sleeve.<ref name="Alexander"/>

The D.4 was usually described as a 50-60&nbsp;hp engine, sometimes as 60&nbsp;hp, 65&nbsp;hp or 60-70&nbsp;hp.  The type designation D.4 was rarely used at the time.

==Operational history==
Green's engines were noted for their reliability and he reinforced that reputation with entries into Government competitions; in 1910 the D.4 won the <U+00A3>1.000 prize donated to the winner by Patrick Alexander. There was a maximum power test, the D.4 achieving 67.8&nbsp;hp at 1,210&nbsp;rpm, but the emphasis was on endurance: the engine had to produce two non-stop 12 hr runs and average more than 58.5&nbsp;hp. In the event, the D.4 averaged 61.6&nbsp;hp with few signs of wear on inspection afterwards.<ref name="Alexander"/>
 
Up to 1912 the Green D.4 was the only all-British aircraft engine capable of producing 60&nbsp;hp,<ref>ENV, who offered a 60&nbsp;hp motor, were a joint Anglo-French concern</ref> so when prizes were offered for flights or races for all-British aircraft, the Green  was the only choice. The best known example is that of [[John Moore-Brabazon, 1st Baron Brabazon of Tara|Moore-Brabazon]] in his [[Short Biplane No. 2]], winning the <U+00A3>1,000 ''Daily Mail'' prize in 1910 for a circular 1 mile flight by a British pilot in an all-British aeroplane.<ref name="Gunston"/>

The British Empire Michelin Trophies (no.1 for speed and no.2 for distance) between 1910 and 1913 were also all-British aircraft competitions. Six of the seven winners were powered by Green engines, showing their dominance and reliability.<ref name="Lumsden"/>  The winners of all four of the 1910-11 contests, three of Cody's aircraft<ref name="Cody"/> plus Moore Brabazon's Short S.2,<ref name="Goodhall"/> were D.4 powered.

[[Samuel Cody|Cody's]] D.4 also powered his entry to fourth place in the 1911 ''Daily Mail'' Circuit of Britain competition, a distance of 1,010 miles.<ref name="Cody"/> That engine, flown over 7,000 miles, was exhibited at the 1913 Olympia Aero Show.<ref name="Olympia 1913"/>  Despite its pre-war success, neither the Green D.4 nor other Green models played a part in the war, in which the lighter, air-cooled French engines of [[Le Rh<U+00F4>ne]], [[Clerget]] and [[Gnome Engine Company|Gnome]] were extensively used.

==Variants==
