'''Vivian Hsu''' ({{zh-cpw|c=<U+5F90><U+82E5><U+7444>|p=X<U+00FA> Ru<U+00F2>xu<U+0101>n|w=Hsu Jo-hsuan}}; [[Japanese language|Japanese]]: <U+30D3><U+30D3><U+30A2><U+30F3><U+30FB><U+30B9><U+30FC> ''Bibian S<U+016B>''; born [[March 19]] [[1975]] in [[Taichung]], [[Taiwan]]) is a famous [[singer]], [[actor|actress]], and [[model (person)|model]] who has gained remarkable popularity in several countries of South-East Asia, mainly in [[Taiwan]] and [[Japan]].

==Beginnings==
The second of three children, Vivian was born <U+5F90><U+6DD1><U+5A1F> ({{zh-p|p=X<U+00FA> Sh<U+00FA>ju<U+0101>n}}), and used this name until she began modelling career. Her parents divorced when she was a child. She attended [[Taipei]] Jianxing Elementary School and Taipei Shulinguo Junior High School.

Vivian's career in entertainment industry started after winning first place in a "Talented Beautiful Girl" contest held by Taiwan CTS TV in 1990. At that point, she was working by delivering food on her bicycle, and her customers began to recongise her from her television appearances. The same year she joined a musical duo named <U+5C11><U+5973><U+968A> (py. [[Shaonu Dui|Sh<U+00E0>o n<U+01D4> D<U+00F9>i]], en. Girls Team). They released two albums, in 1991 and 1992, then broke up. Following this, Vivian got her start in modelling.

==Modelling==
As a model, she produced two photobooks: ''Angel'' (<U+5929><U+4F7F><U+5FC3>, py. Ti<U+0101>nsh<U+01D0> X<U+012B>n) and ''Venus''.

''Angel'', published in 1995, was shot in [[Capri]] and [[Sicily]]. 

''Venus'', published on [[July 7]], [[1996]], was shot in [[Mexico]] and had separate runs in Taiwan and Japan.

Vivian's success in modelling achieved its zenith in July 1996 when she was featured on the cover of two Asian-edition Penthouse magazines (the Japanese edition, and the comparatively low-distribution Hong Kong edition).  Like the photobooks, both these items have become very sought after by Vivian collectors and fans.

Vivian has continued to model for designers such as [[Hang Ten]], [[Gucci]] and [[Mode Marie]], and has modelled in all three of her brief, autobiographical books: ''Earth Onigiri'' (2001), ''Privacy'' (2001, [[Special:Booksources&isbn= ISBN 4-88745-060-5|ISBN 4-88745-060-5]]), and ''Wo Ai Taiwan'' (2002). In addition, most of her musical albums contain substantial inserts featuring new modelling work.

==Music==
Vivian released her first solo single in 1995. She released her first full-length album, ''<U+5929><U+4F7F><U+60F3>'' (py. [[Tianshi Xiang|Ti<U+0101>nsh<U+01D0> Xi<U+01CE>ng]], jp. Tenshi Sou, en. Angel Dreaming) in 1996. Shortly thereafter, she took a speed course in Korean, and released a Korean version of the album titled ''<U+5929><U+4F7F><U+7F8E><U+5C11><U+5973>'' (kr. [[Cheonsa Misonyeo]], py. Ti<U+0101>nsh<U+01D0> M<U+011B>ish<U+00E0>on<U+01D4>, jp. Tenshi Bishoujo, en. Angel Prettygirl). Unusually, neither of Vivian's first two albums was sung in her native language.

In 1997, with two Japanese comedians<U+2014>[[Kiyotaka Nanbara|Kyoya Nanami]] and [[Hiroyuki Amano|Amazan]]<U+2014>and later with a second female vocalist known as 'Keddy', she formed a band known as the [[Black Biscuits]]. The band was formed primarily as a "rival band" for the Japanese music group [[Pocket Biscuits]], which was the creation of the Japanese variety show Utchan Nanchan no UriNari. Between 1997 and 1999, they released three hit singles and a full-length album, ''Life''.  Their single CD "''Timing''" recorded 1.5 million sales in 1998. And, they participated in [[K<U+014D>haku Uta Gassen]] in 1998. 

Towards the end of the group's run, they failed to accomplish one of the challenges set forth by the variety show and the resulting punishment was the disbanding of Black Biscuits.

During this period, Vivian also released two more solo albums: ''<U+5927><U+9EBB><U+7169>'' (py. [[Da Mafan|D<U+00E0> M<U+00E1>f<U+00E1>n]], en. Big Trouble) in 1998, and ''<U+4E0D><U+6557><U+306E><U+6200><U+4EBA>'' (py. [[Bubai de Lianren|B<U+00F9>b<U+00E0>i de Li<U+00E0>nr<U+00E9>n]], en. Undefeatable Lover) in 1999. She followed ''Bubai de Lianren'' with a Japanese translation, ''Fuhai no Koibito'', in 2000.

Later that same year, shortly after quitting smoking for good, she released another new album, ''<U+5047><U+626E><U+7684><U+5929><U+4F7F>'' (py. [[Jiaban de Tianshi|Ji<U+01CE>b<U+00E0>n de Ti<U+0101>nsh<U+01D0>]], en. Pretend Angel).

In 2001, she formed [[The d.e.p]] with Masahide Sakuma, Gota Yashiki, Masami Tsuchiya and Mick Karn. The band was short-lived: by the end of the year they had released all the music they ever would. This amounted to two singles and a full-length album, ''<U+5730><U+7403><U+7684><U+75C5><U+6C17> -We Are the d.e.p-''.

Over the next two years, she released a few more singles, including, alongside [[Kazuma Endo]], ''Moment'', the second opening theme to ''[[Gundam SEED]]'', followed in 2003 by her next solo album, ''[[The Secret to Happiness Is Love|<U+6211><U+611B><U+4F60> x4 the secret to happiness is love]]''. Her last album is ''<U+72E0><U+72E0><U+611B>'' (py. [[Hen Hen Ai|H<U+011B>n H<U+011B>n <U+00C0>i]]), released in [[April 2005]]. Her most recent album is [[Vivi and...]], released in September 2006. For this album, Vivian collaborated with many artists and people including Jay Chou, Wang Leehom, Gary Cao, Nicky Lee and even her little brother and uncle.  

Vivian's music, especially in her later work, covers a great range of genres. Included are slow love songs, R&B, hard rock, and of course J-pop. She has even dabbled in rap. This, combined with the fact that she is fluent in [[Mandarin (linguistics)|Mandarin]], [[Cantonese (linguistics)|Cantonese]], and [[Japanese language|Japanese]] makes her a very versatile artist.

Vivian is also an accomplished lyricist. Her lyric-writing talent first gained serious notice when she completed several songs for Taiwan's R&B singer/songwriter [[Jay Chou]]. By proving that she's not just another pretty idol, but a very capable artist, Vivian surprised both her critics and adorned fans. She continued to collaborate with Jay on his second and third albums after his triumphant self-titled debut, and co-wrote songs for other pop performers, such as [[Vanness Wu]] and [[Gigi Leung]]. Her lyric work is much praised for its clever and straightforward simplicity.

Some Jay Chou songs that she wrote lyrics for are as follows:
* Adorable Woman <U+53EF><U+611B><U+5973><U+4EBA>
* Can't Say <U+958B><U+4E0D><U+4E86><U+53E3>
* Istanbul <U+4F0A><U+65AF><U+5766><U+5821>
* Love's Cliff <U+611B><U+9032><U+61F8><U+5D16>
* Simple Love <U+7C21><U+55AE><U+611B>
* Tornado <U+9F8D><U+6372><U+98A8>

==Acting==
Vivian has appeared in a number of movies and television programs both in Taiwan and in Japan. Her debut films are ''<U+8D64><U+88F8><U+5929><U+4F7F>'' (py. Ch<U+00EC>lu<U+01D2> Ti<U+0101>nsh<U+01D0>, titled "Angel Heart" internationally) in 1994 and ''<U+9B54><U+9B3C><U+5929><U+4F7F>'' (py. M<U+00F3>gu<U+01D0> Ti<U+0101>nsh<U+01D0>, en. Devil Angel) in 1995, both rated as [[Category III]] movies. Before breaking into the Taiwan acting scene, she starred in Hong Kong's L-O-V-E Love...

She also has some experience as a [[seiyu]] (voice actress), having voiced Aisha in ''[[Gundam SEED]]'' for three episodes, as well as [[Princess Morbucks|Princess Morebucks]] in the Taiwanese ''[[The Powerpuff Girls]]''. Perhaps her most recongisable role to Westerners was opposite [[Jackie Chan]] in ''[[The Accidental Spy]]''.

She played the role of Chao Jia Le in [[Love Storm]] (2003), alongside [[Vic Chou]] and [[Ken Chu]]. She also composed and sang the opening theme for this series, ''<U+6C7A><U+5B9A><U+611B><U+4F60>'' (py. Ju<U+00E9>d<U+00EC>ng <U+00C0>i N<U+01D0>, en. Decide to Love You), which was released as a single in 2003.

As with many actors and actresses, she appears from time to time in commercials and as spokesperson for various causes. A complete list of these uncreditable roles (through 2002) can be found at this [http://www.pro-vivian.net/collecting-vivian/timeline.htm career timeline].
