'''Dorian Holley''' is an American musician, [[backing singer]] and [[vocal coach]]. Holley began his professional career as an on-stage backing vocalist for international entertainer [[Michael Jackson]] during the [[Bad World Tour]] in 1987. The series of concerts had him perform to millions of people throughout the world, including [[British Royal Family|British royalty]]. From there, Holley went on to travel with Jackson for all of his subsequent world tours. He also performed with other artists such as [[Rod Stewart]] in 1991 and [[James Taylor]] in 1994. His stage presence and vocal ability were praised by music critics during such performances.

Holley successfully auditioned to become a featured vocalist on the reality television show ''[[Dancing with the Stars (U.S. TV series)|Dancing with the Stars]]''. He served in this capacity for the first three seasons of the American series. Holley has also worked for several years as an associate music director and vocal coach for the singing competition ''[[American Idol]]'', where he works with contestants before and after they appear before the show's judges and a worldwide television audience.

In 2008, Holley self-released his debut album, ''Independent Film''. The subsequent year, he worked with Jackson for the final time, in preparation for the entertainer's ill-fated concert series [[This Is It (Michael Jackson concerts)|This Is It]]. Holley was to serve as a backing vocalist, as well as the vocal director for the shows. [[Death of Michael Jackson|Jackson's death]] forced the concerts to be cancelled. Dorian is married to trial attorney Shawn Chapman Holley, who once represented Jackson. The couple have three daughters together.

==Career==
===Bad World Tour and Rod Stewart===
Holley first performed with pop singer [[Michael Jackson]] during the late entertainer's first solo concert series, the [[Bad World Tour]]. Beginning in Japan in September 1987, the tour lasted for 16 months, during which time Holley visited 15 countries while serving as a backing singer for Jackson, along with Kevin Dorsey, Darryl Phinnessee and [[Sheryl Crow]]. As part of the tour, Holley performed to over 4 million people, including [[Diana, Princess of Wales]] and [[Charles, Prince of Wales]]. The Bad World Tour concluded several months later in January 1989.<ref name="Campbell 230">Campbell, p. 230</ref><ref name="Brooks 81">Brooks, p. 81</ref><ref name="grant 104 105">Grant, pp. 104<U+2013>105</ref><ref name="Grant 123">Grant, p. 123</ref>

English musician [[Rod Stewart]] enlisted the services of both Holley and Phinnessee in 1991, when he toured the US. The two singers were part of a 11-man backing ensemble, when Stewart performed at the [[Pacific Amphitheatre]] in [[Costa Mesa, California|Costa Mesa]], [[Orange County, California|Orange County]], [[California]] in September 1991. During the show's encore, Stewart performed his signature song "[[Twistin' the Night Away]]". The ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' described in a review of the concert that the song was "embellished with a delicious a cappella doo-wop break featuring the 46-year-old star and backup singers Darryl Phinnessee and Dorian Holley".<ref name="Vintage Rod 'n' Roll for Stewart Fans at the Pacific Amphitheatre">{{cite web|url=http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/latimes/access/61487669.html?dids=61487669:61487669&FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT&type=current&date=Sep+16%2C+1991&author=MIKE+BOEHM&pub=Los+Angeles+Times+(pre-1997+Fulltext)&desc=O.C.+POP+MUSIC+REVIEW+Vintage+Rod+'n'+Roll+for+Stewart+Fans+at+the+Pacific+Amphitheatre&pqatl=google|title=Vintage Rod 'n' Roll for Stewart Fans at the Pacific Amphitheatre|last=Boehm|first=Mike|date=September 16, 1991|publisher=''[[Los Angeles Times]]''|format=Payment required to access full article|accessdate=February 8, 2010}}</ref> The two vocalists were also praised by the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' after a performance at the Poplar Creek Music Theatre, where their "sublime harmonies" "formed a perfect counterpoint to Stewart's impassioned pleas on '[[This Old Heart of Mine]]'".<ref name="Stewart tosses a few trifles amid treasures">{{cite web|url=http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/chicagotribune/access/24498778.html?dids=24498778:24498778&FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT&type=current&date=Sep+20%2C+1991&author=Greg+Kot%2C+Rock+music+critic.&pub=Chicago+Tribune+(pre-1997+Fulltext)&desc=Stewart+tosses+a+few+trifles+amid+treasures&pqatl=google|title=Stewart tosses a few trifles amid treasures|last=Kot|first=Greg|date=September 20, 1991|publisher=''[[Chicago Tribune]]''|format=Payment required to access full article|accessdate=February 8, 2010}}</ref> The ''[[San Jose Mercury News]]'' concluded that Holley and Phinnessee were "great".<ref name="Hey, Rod, stay away from our window">{{cite web|url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=SJ&s_site=mercurynews&p_multi=SJ&p_theme=realcities&p_action=search&p_maxdocs=200&p_topdoc=1&p_text_direct-0=0EB7189675771BA4&p_field_direct-0=document_id&p_perpage=10&p_sort=YMD_date:D&s_trackval=GooglePM|title=Hey, Rod, stay away from our window|date=(September 13, 1991)|publisher=''[[San Jose Mercury News]]''|format=Payment required to access full article|accessdate=February 8, 2010}}</ref>

===James Taylor, Dangerous Tour and HIStory Tour===
Holley returned to work with Jackson for the [[Dangerous World Tour]] (June 1992<U+2013>November 1993), a 69 date concert series which was attended by almost 3.5 million fans. The tour was cut short, however, after [[1993 child sexual abuse accusations against Michael Jackson|child sexual abuse allegations]] were levelled against Jackson and he cancelled the remainder of the tour due to the stress caused by the accusations.<ref name="Brooks 81"/><ref name="Per Jackson una forte prevendita">{{cite web|url=http://ricerca.repubblica.it/repubblica/archivio/repubblica/1992/06/07/per-jackson-una-forte-prevendita.html|title=Per Jackson una forte prevendita|date=(June 7, 1992)|publisher=''[[la Repubblica]]''|language=Italian|format=Payment required to access full article|accessdate=February 8, 2010}}</ref><ref name="Tara 504">Taraborrelli, p. 504</ref>

In 1994, Holley joined with [[Kate Markowitz]], [[Valerie Carter]], and [[David Lasley]] to form what ''[[The Pantagraph]]'' and ''[[The Boston Globe]]'' respectively described as a "wonderful" and "angelic" backing group to [[James Taylor]].<ref name="James Taylor and band to perform at Mann Center">{{cite web|url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=AC&p_theme=ac&p_action=search&p_maxdocs=200&p_topdoc=1&p_text_direct-0=0EAEAAFF1F5DAEEF&p_field_direct-0=document_id&p_perpage=10&p_sort=YMD_date:D&s_trackval=GooglePM|title=James Taylor and band to perform at Mann Center|last=Pensiero|first=Nicole|date=August 14, 1994|publisher=''[[The Press of Atlantic City]]''|format=Payment required to access full article|accessdate=February 8, 2010}}</ref><ref name="Taylor: 'How sweet it was'">{{cite web|url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=BL&p_theme=bl&p_action=search&p_maxdocs=200&p_topdoc=1&p_text_direct-0=0EB1442A4ED204B8&p_field_direct-0=document_id&p_perpage=10&p_sort=YMD_date:D&s_trackval=GooglePM|title=Taylor: 'How sweet it was'|date=October 30, 1994|publisher=''[[The Pantagraph]]''|format=Payment required to access full article|accessdate=February 8, 2010}}</ref><ref name="Taylor has fun from 'Memphis' to 'Mexico'">{{cite web|url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=BG&p_theme=bg&p_action=search&p_maxdocs=200&p_topdoc=1&p_text_direct-0=0EADE0F6410E15B9&p_field_direct-0=document_id&p_perpage=10&p_sort=YMD_date:D&s_trackval=GooglePM|title=Taylor has fun from 'Memphis' to 'Mexico'|last=Morse|first=Steve|date=August 26, 1994|publisher=''The Boston Globe''|format=Payment required to access full article|accessdate=February 8, 2010}}</ref> While on tour with Taylor, Holley was praised for his vocal ability by several news sources.

Holley worked with Michael Jackson again for the entertainer's last concert series, the [[HIStory World Tour]], which began in [[Prague, Czech Republic]] in September 1996. The tour attracted more than 4.5&nbsp;million fans from 58 cities in 35 countries around the world and concluded in [[Durban, South Africa]] in October 1997.<ref name="Brooks 81"/><ref name="Grant 188">Grant, p. 188</ref><ref name="Grant 202">Grant, p. 202</ref>

===Reality television work===
Holley auditioned to become a featured vocalist on the American reality television show ''[[Dancing with the Stars (U.S. TV series)|Dancing with the Stars]]''. The audition consisted of him performing seven different sounds, ranging from [[Frank Sinatra]] to [[Sly Stone]]. He was successful and became a featured singer during the first three seasons of the series.<ref name="Voice of reason" /> Holley later noted that the concept of diversity in vocal performance was not a new experience for him. "I've been at sessions where a producer has said he wants me to sound like Michael Jackson and Bruce Springsteen at the same time. I've had people say can you make it a little more green. Huh? It's tricky." He added, "Sometimes they think they want Sheryl Crow, because she has a hit single. But what they really want is magic, and that is whatever you, as an individual, can bring. It's a tough call between being a blank slate and being yourself."<ref name="Voice of reason" />

Holley has also served for several years as an associate music director and vocal coach for the reality singing competition ''[[American Idol]]''. As part of his job, he helps contestants rehearse and arrange the songs that they are to perform. He states that his primary task, however, is to encourage and support the participants as they face scrutiny and criticism. Holley added that it is common for some of the contestants to "crumbl[e]" upon leaving the stage if they have received critical comments from judge [[Simon Cowell]].<ref name="Voice of reason" /> His job on ''American Idol'' has had him work with winners such as [[Jordin Sparks]] and [[Kris Allen]].<ref name="'American Idol': A week of running before the show">{{cite web|url=http://www.usatoday.com/life/television/news/2007-05-07-idol-final-four_N.htm|title='American Idol': A week of running before the show|last=Keveney|first=Bill|date=July 5, 2007|publisher=''[[USA Today]]''|accessdate=February 8, 2010}}</ref><ref name="Peek behind the 'Idol' curtain">{{cite web|url=http://www.usatoday.com/printedition/life/20090513/idolbackstage13_cv.art.htm|title=Peek behind the 'Idol' curtain|last=Cava|first=Marco R. della|date=May 13, 2009|publisher=''USA Today''|accessdate=February 9, 2010}}</ref>

===Debut album, workshops and This Is It===
''Independent Film'', Holley's debut solo album, was self-released by the singer in 2008. Joan Anderman of ''The Boston Globe'' described the album as being a "soul-satisfying project that won't pay the bills".<ref name="Voice of reason" /> It was reported in October 2008 that Holley had been conducting workshops on the art of audition. He drew inspiration from his time on ''American Idol'', as well as his experience with artists such as [[Stevie Wonder]], [[Christina Aguilera]], [[Kanye West]] and [[Queen Latifah]]. While at [[Berklee College of Music]], he offered advice to young singers who wanted to become famous. "Everyone starts out dreaming, and then you get married, have a baby, buy a house and a car, and what I want to let people know is that there are so many jobs out there. My thinking is, if you're a musician and you can make music instead of digging a ditch, make it."<ref name="Voice of reason" />

Holley's last experiences with Jackson were in 2009, when he prepared for a scheduled 50-date concert series called [[This Is It (Michael Jackson concerts)|This Is It]]. Holley rehearsed with Jackson as a backing singer at the [[Staples Center]] in Los Angeles and was also hired as the vocal director for the ill-fated shows. He was present on the singer's last night of rehearsals in June 2009. Hours later, [[Death of Michael Jackson|Jackson died]] after he entered into [[cardiac arrest]] at his nearby home.<ref name="The situation room">{{cite web|url=http://edition.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0907/02/sitroom.01.html|title=The situation room|last=Malveaux|first=Suzanne|date=July 2, 2009|publisher=[[CNN]]|accessdate=February 9, 2010}}</ref><ref name="What Michael Jackson Did on His Last Day">{{cite web|url=http://www.time.com/time/arts/article/0,8599,1907601,00.html?xid=rss-topstories|title=What Michael Jackson Did on His Last Day|last=Snyder|first=S.
