'''Panait Cerna''' ([[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]]: <U+041F><U+0430><U+043D><U+0430><U+0439><U+043E><U+0442> <U+0427><U+0435><U+0440><U+043D><U+0430>, ''Panayot Cherna'', born '''Panayot Stanchov''' or '''Panait Staciov'''; August 26 or September 25, 1881<ref>C<U+0103>linescu, p.651. The second date is reported to have been once communicated by Cerna himself</ref>&ndash;March 26, 1913) was a [[Romania]]n poet, philosopher, literary critic and translator. A native speaker of Bulgarian, Cerna nonetheless wrote in [[Romanian language|Romanian]], and developed a traditionalist style which was connected with [[Classicism]] and [[Neoclassicism]]. Praised by the [[Conservatism|conservative]] literary society ''[[Junimea]]'', he was promoted by its leader [[Titu Maiorescu]], as well as by Maiorescu's disciples [[Mihail Dragomirescu]] and [[Simion Mehedin<U+0163>i]]. Cerna became the group's main representative during its decline, contributing to both major Junimist magazines, ''[[Convorbiri Literare]]'' and ''[[Convorbiri Critice]]''. He also contributed pieces to the traditionalist magazine ''[[S<U+0103>m<U+0103>n<U+0103>torul]]'', and was briefly affiliated with other literary journals.  

A graduate of the [[University of Bucharest]], Cerna completed his studies in the [[German Empire]]. There, he attended the [[University of Berlin]] and the [[University of Leipzig]], befriending the self-exiled Romanian dramatist [[Ion Luca Caragiale]] and the literary critic [[Paul Zarifopol]]. Cerna died in [[Leipzig]] at the age of thirty-one, after a long battle with [[tuberculosis]].

Along with various love poems, Panait Cerna's writings also evince his intellectual pursuits. This intellectual characteristic earned him a dedicated following, but was criticized by many of his peers, who found it artificial and outdated.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Cerna's early name, rendered in Bulgarian as <U+041F><U+0430><U+043D><U+0430><U+0439><U+043E><U+0442> <U+0421><U+0442><U+0430><U+043D><U+0447><U+043E><U+0432>, was commonly [[Romanization of Bulgarian|transliterated]] into Romanian as ''Panait Stanciov'', ''Stancov'', ''Stanciof'' or ''Stancioff''. The poet's preferred name alluded to [[Cerna, Tulcea|Cerna]], his birthplace in [[Tulcea County]], [[Northern Dobruja]].<ref name="C<U+0103>linescu">C<U+0103>linescu, p.651</ref>

Panait Cerna's father was an [[Bulgarians|ethnic Bulgarian]] schoolteacher, also named Panayot Stachov (Panait Stanciov).<ref name="C<U+0103>linescu"/> He settled in Cerna and married Maria Ta<U+015F>cu. The daughter of local peasants,<ref name="C<U+0103>linescu"/> she was of [[Aromanians|Aromanian]]<ref name="msdobr">{{ro icon}} Mirela St<U+00EE>ng<U+0103>, [http://www.ziuaconstanta.ro/rubrici/cultura/panait-cerna,-poetul-meleagurilor-dobrogene.html "Panait Cerna, poetul meleagurilor dobrogene"], in ''[[Ziua|Ziua de Constan<U+0163>a]]'', April 8, 2008</ref> or of Bulgarian origin.<ref>Petar Karchev, ''<U+041F><U+0440><U+0435><U+0437> <U+043F><U+0440><U+043E><U+0437><U+043E><U+0440><U+0435><U+0446><U+0430> <U+043D><U+0430> <U+0435><U+0434><U+043D><U+043E> <U+043F><U+043E><U+043B><U+0443><U+0441><U+0442><U+043E><U+043B><U+0435><U+0442><U+0438><U+0435> (1900<U+2013>1950)'', Iztok-Zapad, Sofia, 2004, p.&nbsp;449<U+2013>450.  ISBN 954-321-056-X</ref> Shortly before Maria gave birth to their son, Romanian administration began taking over in previously [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]]-ruled Northern Dobruja. Stanchov, who was a Bulgarian [[Nationalism|nationalist]], refused to accept this change and left for the [[Principality of Bulgaria]], leaving his family behind. Consequently,  Cerna never met his father.<ref name="C<U+0103>linescu"/><ref name="msdobr"/><ref name="C<U+0103>linescu"/> By Cerna's own account, his childhood was marked by acute poverty and social isolation: "[I was] told to tutor and learn in cold, unfriendly rooms. For a long time, we lived in a house on the outskirts, which was avoided by other men, since a rumor had spread that ghosts haunted its rooms. Can you imagine living in the middle of winter, without a fire on, with doors that barely close, with windows that are glued with paper? A person made of iron would still feel cold down to the bone."<ref name="msdobr"/>

Although his links to [[Culture of Bulgaria|Bulgarian culture]] were weakened by his father's departure, Cerna, who was baptized in the [[Bulgarian Greek Catholic Church]], became fluent in Bulgarian.<ref name="C<U+0103>linescu"/> According to literary critic [[George C<U+0103>linescu]], he always had some difficulties conversing in Romanian, but could write it with ease.<ref name="C<U+0103>linescu_2">C<U+0103>linescu, p.651, 652</ref>

After completing primary school in his native village, he graduated from a high school in the [[Danube]] port of [[Br<U+0103>ila]], then enrolled at the Faculty of Letters and Philosophy in [[Bucharest]].<ref name="C<U+0103>linescu"/><ref name="msdobr"/> He was also attending lectures at the Faculty of Chemistry and Physics.<ref name="msdobr"/> Cerna debuted as a poet in 1897, at the age of sixteen, when his ''Trecutul'' ("The Past")<U+2014>an adaptation of a piece by [[Nikolaus Lenau]]<U+2014>was published in [[George Co<U+015F>buc]]'s ''Foaia Interesant<U+0103>'' magazine.<ref name="msdobr"/><ref name="pcunifi">{{it icon}} [http://www.unifi.it/letrum/CMpro-v-p-1001.html "Panait Cerna"], biographical note in [http://www.unifi.it/letrum/ ''Cronologia della letteratura rumena moderna (1780<U+2013>1914)'' database], at the [[University of Florence]]'s Department of Neo-Latin Languages and Literatures; retrieved April 18, 2008</ref> His first original poem, ''Orientale'' ("Orientals"), saw print two years later in the magazine ''Carmen''.<ref name="msdobr"/>

===''Junimea'' years===
Soon after reaching the capital, Cerna became involved in political debates and the literary environment. These early activities are recorded in a 1904 series of articles in the student paper ''Tipuri <U+015F>i Ticuri'', where a ''P. Stanciov'' is the object of [[satire]].<ref name="C<U+0103>linescu"/> By that time, he was discovered by ''Junimea'', and began collaborating with ''Convorbiri Literare'', a magazine led by [[Simion Mehedin<U+0163>i]].<ref name="Ornea">Ornea, p.78; Vianu, Vol.II, p.11</ref> After 1903, Cerna contributed  to ''[[S<U+0103>m<U+0103>n<U+0103>torul]]'',<ref name="msdobr"/><ref>Lovinescu, p.10</ref> and his poems also appeared sporadically in other publications, including ''Floare Albastr<U+0103>'' and ''Revista Modern<U+0103>''.<ref name="msdobr"/>

Despite ongoing financial difficulties, Cerna graduated from university in 1906.<ref name="C<U+0103>linescu"/><ref name="msdobr"/><ref name="pcunifi"/> His thesis was passed with a ''[[Latin honors|Magna cum laude]]'' qualifier.<ref name="msdobr"/> He was by then seriously ill with tuberculosis, and sought a change in climate.<ref name="C<U+0103>linescu_3">C<U+0103>linescu, p.652</ref> Cerna spent much of this period traveling through the [[Romanian Old Kingdom|Old Kingdom]], and several times visited regions of the [[Southern Carpathians]], in particular the area of [[Ruc<U+0103>r]], the [[Bucegi Mountains]], and the [[Jiu Valley]].<ref name="C<U+0103>linescu_3"/> As C<U+0103>linescu notes, he had bought himself a horse from a Ruc<U+0103>r local on credit, and failed to deliver the promised sum on time.<ref name="C<U+0103>linescu_3"/> 

Cerna's love of rural life, together with what C<U+0103>linescu describes as a "social preoccupation", made him an outspoken opponent of the way in which the authorities handled the [[1907 Romanian Peasants' Revolt|peasant uprising of 1907]].<ref name="C<U+0103>linescu_3"/> That year, as [[Mihail Dragomirescu]] parted with Mehedin<U+0163>i to establish ''Convorbiri Critice'', which advertised a ''Junimist'' agenda while standing against ''Convorbiri Literare'', Cerna became one of his main collaborators.<ref>Ornea, p.&nbsp;136<U+2013>137</ref> The group of ''Convorbiri Critice'' writers also included [[D. Nanu]], [[Corneliu Moldovanu]], [[Emil G<U+00E2>rleanu]], [[I. Dragoslav]] and [[Gheorghe V<U+00E2>lsan]].<ref name="Ornea_2">Ornea, p.137</ref> In 1908, he decided to continue his studies in the [[German Empire]].<ref>C<U+0103>linescu, p.602, 651</ref> The decision was influenced and encouraged by ''Junimea'' and its leader [[Titu Maiorescu]],<ref>C<U+0103>linescu, p.602; Vianu, Vol.II, p.13</ref> who, as [[Minister of Education, Research and Youth (Romania)|Minister of Education]] granted him a [[scholarship]].<ref name="msdobr"/> C<U+0103>linescu describes this as a sign of late ''Junimist'' [[elitism]], a view which implied that all literary men should be academics.<ref name="C<U+0103>linescu_4">C<U+0103>linescu, p.602</ref> This, he argues, was one of the few areas in which ''Junimea'' still differed from ''S<U+0103>m<U+0103>n<U+0103>torul'', which was more open to less elitist environments.<ref name="C<U+0103>linescu_4"/> 

Cerna visited the [[University of Heidelberg]], but, following the advice of Maiorescu, decided in favor of the [[Humboldt University of Berlin|University of Berlin]], where he studied Philosophy, [[English literature|English]] and [[German language literature]] (1908<U+2013>1910).<ref name="C<U+0103>linescu"/> Around 1909, he first came into contact with the Caragiales, and, according to the dramatist's own testimony, tutored his son, the future poet [[Luca Caragiale]], providing his "scientific education".<ref name="C<U+0103>linescu"/> Ion Luca Caragiale described Cerna as "a distinguished scientist and a great lover of music".<ref name="C<U+0103>linescu"/> The two writers met a second time in [[Leipzig]], in 1910, when Cerna declared himself captivated by Caragiale, whom he described as "one of the richest intelligent minds to have ever been produced by our nation."<ref name="C<U+0103>linescu"/> Two years later, Cerna enthusiastically welcomed the literary debut of Caragiale's other son, [[Mateiu Caragiale|Mateiu]].<ref>C<U+0103>linescu, p.898</ref>

===Studies abroad and death===
From late 1910 to early 1912, Cerna was at the [[University of Leipzig]], where he attended courses held by the philosophers and psychologists [[Wilhelm Wundt]], [[Eduard Spranger]] and [[Hans Volkelt]].<ref name="C<U+0103>linescu_2"/> Wundt left an enduring impression on his Romanian student. In a letter home, Cerna described his modest appearance, which he claimed recalled that of "decrepit" [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox]] members of the [[History of the Jews in Romania|Romanian Jewish community]], adding: "But I do love this decrepit exterior beyond measure&nbsp;..."<ref name="C<U+0103>linescu_3"/> Volkelt guided Cerna's research in the scientific field, and coordinated his [[PhD]] thesis of 1913, ''Die Gedankenlyrik'' ([[German language|German]] for "Contemplative Poetry").<ref name="C<U+0103>linescu"/> According to C<U+0103>linescu, Cerna's work stated the primacy of "natural ideas" over [[reasoning]], and concluded that "ideas have the purpose of signaling the problematic tensions of the soul."<ref name="C<U+0103>linescu"/> Zarifopol wrote that Cerna was upset over having himself parted with writing poetry, and came to be preoccupied by Maiorescu's German-language dictum: ''In der Poesie ist der Gedanke ein verfluchtes Ding'' ("An idea is a damned thing when it comes to poetry").<ref name="zarifartisti">{{ro icon}} [[Paul Zarifopol]], [http://ro.wikisource.org/wiki/Arti%C5%9Fti_%C5%9Fi_idei_literare_rom%C3%A2ne:Poezie_filozofic%C4%83 ''Arti<U+015F>ti <U+015F>i idei literare rom<U+00E2>ne: Poezie filozofic<U+0103>''] (wikisource)</ref> Panait Cerna's first volume of collected poetry was published at home in 1910, and, two years later, resulted in the author being made a co-recipient of the [[Romanian Academy]]'s [[Vasile Adamachi]] Award.<ref name="msdobr"/> Some of his new poems were still being published by ''Convorbiri Literare'' in 1911.<ref name="icvieata">{{ro icon}} [[Ilarie Chendi]], [http://documente.bcucluj.ro/web/bibdigit/periodice/luceafarul/1912/BCUCLUJ_FP_280091_1912_011_003.pdf "Viea<U+0163>a literar<U+0103> <U+00EE>n 1911 (o privire general<U+0103>)"], in ''[[Luceaf<U+0103>rul (magazine)|Luceaf<U+0103>rul]]'', Nr. 3/1912, p.62 (digitized by the [[Babe<U+015F>-Bolyai University]] [http://documente.bcucluj.ro/ Transsylvanica Online Library])</ref>

Panait Cerna died in Leipzig, shortly after receiving his diploma.<ref name="msdobr"/><ref name="C<U+0103>linescu_3"/><ref name="zarifartisti"/> Zarifopol was present when Cerna succumbed, and recorded that Maiorescu's views on poetry where preoccupied his friend even on his deathbed.<ref name="zarifartisti"/> The poet was buried in the German city, and later exhumed for burial in Bucharest's [[Bellu Cemetery]].<ref name="msdobr"/>

==Literary contribution==
Cerna was a traditionalist poet, listed by C<U+0103>linescu among the contributors to [[Literature of Romania|Romanian literature]] whose work "steers toward [[Classicism]]", as do those of Dragomirescu, Mehedin<U+0163>i, [[Henri Sanielevici]], [[D. Nanu]], [[Ion Trivale]], [[Cincinat Pavelescu]], [[Corneliu Moldovanu]], [[Mihail Codreanu]], [[Alexandru Davila]] and [[George Murnu]].<ref>C<U+0103>linescu, p.&nbsp;641<U+2013>660</ref> In this account, Cerna is one in a group of "conceptual" poets, all of whom were connected with Dragomirescu.<ref>C<U+0103>linescu, p.652, 657</ref> For part of his life, Cerna was also formally committed to [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolism]] and the [[Symbolist movement in Romania|local Symbolist movement]], whose aesthetic ideals he merged with his lyrical style, and sought to recover part of the [[Romanticism|Romantic]] legacy.<ref name="pcunifi"/> He was thus known as the translator of works by Romantic poets, as well as for adopting a [[Messianism|Messianic]] and [[Humanism|Humanist]] perspective on life (notably present in his poems ''Floare <U+015F>i genune'', "Flower and Chasm"; ''Zile de durere'', "Days of Sorrow"; and ''Pl<U+00E2>nsetul lui Adam'', "[[Adam]]'s Sobbing").<ref name="pcunifi"/><ref name="Lovinescu">Lovinescu, p.84</ref>

Literary historian [[Tudor Vianu]] notes the influence exercised on Cerna and other traditionalists by [[Mihai Eminescu]], Romania's major mid-19th century Classicist and ''Junimist'' poet.<ref>Vianu, Vol.II, p.213; Vol.III, p.322</ref> [[Modernism|modernist]] theorist [[Eugen Lovinescu]] also believes that the "matter in which [Cerna] worked" was largely "dominated by Eminescu."<ref name="Lovinescu"/> He also cautions that there is a major difference between the two: Cerna is an [[Optimism|optimist]], while Eminescu most often projected a [[Pessimism|pessimistic]] attitude.<ref name="Lovinescu_2">Lovinescu, p.85</ref> According to Zarifopol, the poet considered himself an "improved follower" of Eminescu.<ref name="zarifgeniul">{{ro icon}} [[Paul Zarifopol]], [http://ro.wikisource.org/wiki/Arti%C5%9Fti_%C5%9Fi_idei_literare_rom%C3%A2ne:Geniul_neprih%C4%83nit ''Arti<U+015F>ti <U+015F>i idei literare rom<U+00E2>ne: Geniul neprih<U+0103>nit''] (wikisource)</ref> Cerna was also a late admirer of [[George Gordon Byron, 6th Baron Byron|Lord Byron]], a main figure of [[England|English]] Romanticism, and translated from his ''[[Childe Harold]]''.<ref name="etetudes">[[Emil Turdeanu|<U+00C9>mile Turdeanu]], ''<U+00C9>tudes de litt<U+00E9>rature roumaine et d'<U+00E9>crits slaves et grecs des principaut<U+00E9>s roumaines'', [[Brill Publishers]], Leiden, New York & K<U+00F6>ln, 1985, p.397.  ISBN 90-04-07098-2</ref> One of Cerna's poems was an [[Epic poetry|epic]] piece inspired by the [[Book of Genesis]], where Adam confronts God. Titled ''Pl<U+00E2>nsetul lui Adam'', it builds on themes which recalled Byron's 1821 play ''[[Cain (play)|Cain]]'', and constituted an interrogation of [[divine law]]s.<ref name="etetudes"/>

In ''Pl<U+00E2>nsetul lui Adam'' and various other pieces, Panait Cerna (called a "reflexive poet" by contemporary critic [[Ilarie Chendi]])<ref name="icvieata"/> sought to reconcile poetry and philosophy, thus creating a hybrid form of conceptual poetry. Eugen Lovinescu proposed that, although praised by Cerna's contemporaries, this goal was "mediocre", and that the literature it produced "does not express and does not suggest profound spiritual states, but, on the contrary, it expresses by means of [[rhetoric]]al [[dialectic]] not only that which can be expressed, but also that which can be proven."<ref name="Lovinescu"/> Paul Zarifopol, who notes that Cerna particularly treasured the Classicist poets [[Friedrich Schiller]], [[Louise-Victorine Ackermann]] and [[Jean-Marie Guyau]], as well as the [[Parnassianism|Parnassian]] [[Sully Prudhomme]],<ref name="zarifartisti"/> recounted their disagreement when it came to Caragiale, whom Cerna enjoyed only for his power of "observation", but whom he argued lacked "concepts".<ref name="zarifgeniul"/> For Zarifopol, this statement, made with "a fanatical and dogmatic pathos", evidenced a moment of "academic foolishness" in Cerna's career.<ref name="zarifgeniul"/>

C<U+0103>linescu, who criticizes the poet for his difficulties with the language, describes him as "not accomplished".<ref name="C<U+0103>linescu_3"/> Elaborating on this, he states: "[Cerna is] declamatory, banal and dry in his use of metaphors, although he displays a touch of the sublime here and there."<ref name="C<U+0103>linescu_3"/> Lovinescu thought many of the expressions Cerna used in his poetry to be "unacceptable", and argued that they were characterized by banality.<ref>C<U+0103>linescu, p.&nbsp;805<U+2013>806; Lovinescu, p.&nbsp;84<U+2013>85</ref> This assessment was itself contested by C<U+0103>linescu, who argued that the lyrics in questions are "actually the acceptable ones", and that the awkward wordings "are entirely lost in lyrical fluency."<ref>C<U+0103>linescu, p.&nbsp;805<U+2013>806</ref> Among the writings forming the subject of this disagreement was Cerna's ''Din dep<U+0103>rtare'' ("From Far Away"), which Lovinescu believed was marked by the use of repetitive and banal poetic images:

The subject of [[unrequited love]] was one of the major ones in Cerna's [[Lyric poetry|lyric poems]] and, C<U+0103>linescu argues, it evoked his actual experience with women, as "the regret of not having lived through the great mystery of love."<ref name="C<U+0103>linescu_3"/> These pieces, the critic notes, point to the influence of Classicist authors such as Eminescu, [[Dante Aligheri]], and [[Giacomo Leopardi]] (the latter poet had also been quoted in Cerna's ''Die Gedankenlyrik'').<ref name="C<U+0103>linescu_3"/> One of the pieces, written from the perspective of a man who has once failed to gain the object of his affection, features the lyrics:

While rejecting Cerna's conceptual approach, Lovinescu admired his style, for "the amplitude through which [the sentiment] is laid out in vast chimes and compact constructions of rhetorical stanzas."<ref name="Lovinescu_2"/> Such features, he concluded, surpassed "everything ever written in our country".<ref name="Lovinescu_2"/> For George C<U+0103>linescu, Cerna's "euphoric thirst for life" recalled the work of Parnassian and Symbolist author [[Alexandru Macedonski]], but was tempered by "the mellow [[anemia]] of the phthisic."<ref name="C<U+0103>linescu_3"/> One of his better-known pieces from the series of love poems read:

Cerna's protest over the violent repression of the [[1907 Romanian Peasants' Revolt|1907 revolt]] was lyricized in several contexts. In one such indignant piece, Cerna called on Peace not to arrive until the social issue would be solved.<ref name="C<U+0103>linescu_3"/> In ''Zile de durere'', he appeals to the Sun to wash out the blood of peasant victims:

Panait Cerna's lifetime success and literary fame made him the target of adulation among his fellow traditionalists, a camp which united various ''Junimea'' affiliates and ''S<U+0103>m<U+0103>n<U+0103>torul'' contributors. According to C<U+0103>linescu, this group saw him as Romania's answer to Schiller and [[Percy Bysshe Shelley]].<ref name="C<U+0103>linescu_3"/> ''Junimea'' saw in him one of its most important members of the early 20th century, while several historians note that he was so only because, at that stage, the literary society was declining.<ref name="Ornea"/> Mehedin<U+0163>i's 1914 account of the ''Junimist'' promotion of the "original manifestations of Romanian culture" listed Cerna alongside [[Alexandru G. Florescu]] and other minor writers.<ref name="Ornea_3">Ornea, p.78</ref> Literary historian [[Z. Ornea]] argues that this evidenced not just a decline in standards, but also Mehedin<U+0163>i's "tastelessness".<ref name="Ornea_3"/> Also according to Ornea, the association with Dragomirescu was also characteristic for the ''Junimist'' twilight, given that this circle had failed to impose "a new literary direction", and was tributary to the legacy of various traditionalist groups.<ref name="Ornea_2"/> At the same time, both Dragomirescu and his disciple [[Ion Trivale]] upheld him as a model to follow, equating him with the mid-19th century Classicist [[Grigore Alexandrescu]].<ref>Lovinescu, p.&nbsp;31<U+2013>32, 84</ref> Zarifopol deplores Cerna's submission to traditionalist and Classicist goals, arguing that it eventually ruined Cerna as a poet and made him unhappy.<ref name="zarifartisti"/> 

The poet's adoption of a mainstream approach to poetry also pleased his public, and, C<U+0103>linescu notes, schoolbooks of the day celebrated him as a Romanian classic while completely ignoring more controversial [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolists]] such as Macedonski and [[Dimitrie Anghel]].<ref name="C<U+0103>linescu_3"/> His contributions have helped shaped the style of 20th century poets with traditionalist tendencies from different schools. Among them are the [[Socialism|socialist]] [[Alexandru Toma]],<ref>Lovinescu, p.87</ref> later known as an official poet of [[Communist Romania]], and ''S<U+0103>m<U+0103>n<U+0103>torul'' 's [[Ion S<U+00E2>n-Giorgiu]],<ref>Lovinescu, p.67</ref> whose career later took him through an [[Expressionism|Expressionist]] stage and eventually to [[Fascism|fascist]] politics. [[Demostene Botez]], another author to have been influenced by Cerna's style, dedicated his mentor a poem which read:

A giant you have been in a world filled only with dwarfs,
A lonely evening star among so many fire flies.

In his essay ''Din registrul ideilor ginga<U+015F>e'' ("From the Register of Gentle Ideas"), where he satirizes the Romanian public's reception of literature, Zarifopol looks into the problems faced by Cerna in satisfying his readers. Using one of Cerna's own accounts as the basis for this analysis, he notes that a group of his young "female admirers" where unpleasantly surprised to find out that their idol was "short, pudgy, wide-necked and ruddy-faced."<ref name="zarifneint">{{ro icon}} [[Paul Zarifopol]], [http://ro.wikisource.org/wiki/Din_registrul_ideilor_ginga%C5%9Fe:Ne%C3%AEn%C5%A3elegeri_inocente_%C3%AEntre_public_%C5%9Fi_arti%C5%9Fti ''Din registrul ideilor ginga<U+015F>e: Ne<U+00EE>n<U+0163>elegeri inocente <U+00EE>ntre public <U+015F>i arti<U+015F>ti''] (wikisource)</ref> He writes: "the girls&nbsp;... were thus in full agreement with the philosophical tradition which, since the old days, has set as a supreme ideal a mosaic of perfections that is naive and unlikely."<ref name="zarifneint"/>

Like Lovinescu, other advocates of [[modernist literature]] rejected most of Cerna's contributions. One of the first to have done so is [[Ovid Densusianu]], who stated his belief that an artist's work should be separated from his life. Lovinescu, who commented on Densusianu and his thoughts on Cerna, opined that Densusianu had a tendency to reject all poets who registered popular success, and that he treated Dimitrie Anghel's work in much the same way.<ref>Lovinescu, p.36</ref> 

The poet's house in Cerna is presently a museum, dedicated in part to his memory, and also housing a permanent exhibit dedicated to the traditional arts and crafts of [[Tulcea County]].<ref name="msdobr"/><ref name="pcicemt">{{ro icon}} [http://icem.romclub.ro/cerna.php ''Casa memorial<U+0103> Panait Cerna''], at the  [http://icem.romclub.ro/ Tulcea Institute for Environmental Studies and Museology]; retrieved April 17, 2008</ref> It also features a bust of the poet.<ref name="pcicemt"/> The county library in [[Tulcea]] city is named after him,<ref name="msdobr"/><ref>[http://www.cjtulcea.ro/en/inst_subord/biblioteca.html ''"Panait Cerna" County Library''], official site; retrieved April 17, 2008</ref> as are a high school in [[Br<U+0103>ila]]<ref>[http://harta.bdne.edu.ro/harta/unitate.html?idUnitateInvatamant=10013821&limba=en The Panait Cerna High School], [http://rural.edu.ro/harta/?limba=en ''School Map''] entry; hosted by the [[Minister of Education, Research and Youth (Romania)|Romanian Ministry of Education, Research and Youth]]; retrieved April 17, 2008</ref> and streets in Bucharest, Br<U+0103>ila, [[Bistri<U+0163>a]], [[Hunedoara]], [[Lugoj]] and [[Petro<U+015F>ani]].
