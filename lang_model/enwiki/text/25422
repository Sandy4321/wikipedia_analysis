==Geography of Irish Rivers==
''see also'': [[Geography of Ireland]]

The main river in Ireland is the [[River Shannon]], 386&nbsp;km (240&nbsp;mi), the longest river in both [[Ireland]] and the [[British Isles]], which separates the boggy midlands of Ireland from the West of Ireland. The river develops into three lakes along its course, [[Lough Allen]], [[Lough Ree]] and [[Lough Derg (Munster)|Lough Derg]]. Of these, Lough Derg is the biggest. The River Shannon enters the [[Atlantic Ocean]] after [[Limerick|Limerick city]] at the [[Shannon Estuary]]. Other major rivers include the [[River Liffey]], [[River Lee (Ireland)|River Lee]], [[River Swilly]], [[River Blackwater]], [[River Nore]], [[River Suir]], [[River Barrow]] and [[River Boyne]

==History of Irish Rivers==
''see also'': [[History of Ireland]]

Irish waterways have been used for transport since the earilest times. The [[Vikings]] used the rivers <U+2014>for raiding deep inland. The [[Viking]] sea-king, Thormodr Helgason, used his base on the west coast to raid the length of the [[River Shannon]] from [[Lough Derg (Munster)|Lough Derg]] to [[Lough Ree]], pillaging ecclesiastical settlements. In [[937]] the [[Limerick]] Vikings clashed with those of [[Dublin]] on [[Lough Ree]] and were defeated. In [[943]] they were defeated again when the chief of the local Dalcassian clan joined with Ceallachan, king of [[Munster]] and the Limerick Vikings were forced to pay tribute to the clans. The power of the Vikings never recovered, and they reduced to the level of a minor clan, however often playing pivotal parts in the endless power struggles of the next few centuries.

===Canals===
''see main article'': [[Canals of Ireland]]

[[Canal]]s were built in the 19th Century connecting the [[River Shannon]] to [[Dublin]]. They were important for the transport of goods before the [[Railways]] took over. Major canals include the [[Grand Canal of Ireland|Grand]] and the [[Royal Canal of Ireland|Royal]] canals.

==List of Rivers==
''This is a list of rivers in the whole island of [[Ireland]]; that is to say, it includes rivers in both [[Northern Ireland]] and the [[Republic of Ireland]]''.  

The rivers are listed in clockwise order of their outflows, starting from the Foyle at [[Derry]], and for convenience are divided by jurisdiction of their outflows, and by the sea into which they each drain.
