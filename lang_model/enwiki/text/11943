'''Carl Genian''' (September 21, 1921 <U+2013> May 25, 1967) was a [[first lieutenant]] in the [[United States Army Air Forces]] during [[World War II]]. During the War, Genian spent eleven months overseas and flew 66 combat missions. During his service, he pursued numerous bombing targets that spanned eight countries from France to the Balkans. He and his unit received numerous commendations for close support, pinpoint bombing operations and heroism. Some of Genian's medals include the [[Distinguished Flying Cross]], [[Soldiers Medal]] and an [[Air Medal]] with six [[oak leaf clusters]].{{sfn|Armenian General Benevolent Union|1951|p=103}}

==Life==
Of [[Armenians|Armenian]] descent, Carl Genian was born in [[Yettem, California|Yettem]], [[California]] and was the oldest of four children.{{sfn|Demirjian|1996|p=296}} His father, Arshag Genian, was born in [[Tomarza]], [[Ottoman Empire]] and moved to the United States and became a rancher in [[Dinuba, California|Dinuba]], [[California]].{{sfn|Demirjian|1996|p=296}} His mother, Eliza (Mendikian) Genian, was born in [[Kayseri]], [[Ottoman Empire]].{{sfn|Demirjian|1996|p=296}} Carl Genian had two sisters, Charlotte and Stella, and the youngest of the four children was his brother Sam.{{sfn|Demirjian|1996|p=296}}

Genian attended Dinuba High School, where he participated in basketball and played [[sousaphone]] and [[tuba]] in the band.{{sfn|Demirjian|1996|p=296-97}} After school, when time permitted, Genian joined the family to work on the farm. After graduation, he enlisted as an aviation cadet. He subsequently attended the Army Air Force school for radio operations and mechanics at [[Scott Field]], [[Illinois]], and the school for bombardiers in [[San Angelo]], [[Texas]].{{sfn|Demirjian|1996|p=297}}

After his discharge from the Air Force in July 1945, he attended [[UC Berkeley]] and majored in civil engineering.{{sfn|Demirjian|1996|p=302}} He graduated from UC Berkely in 1950.<ref>{{cite book|title=Blue and Gold: Being a Record of the College Year|year=1950|publisher=University of California, Berkeley|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=MVkMAQAAIAAJ&q}}</ref> In 1946, before completing his studies, he went to work for Gordon Ball Construction Company in [[Danville, California]], [[California]]. He became an estimator for building bridges and highways until his death on May 25, 1967.{{sfn|Demirjian|1996|p=302}}

Genian was married to Lucy Jandegian, born in [[South Milwaukee]], [[Wisconsin]].{{sfn|Demirjian|1996|p=302}} They had two children: Bill born in 1950, and Christopher, born in 1962.{{sfn|Demirjian|1996|p=302}}

==World War II==
[[File:GenianAirSoldiersMedal.jpg|thumb|left|Carl Genian receiving the Air Medal and Soldier's Medal]]
Genian received his commission as a second lieutenant<ref>{{cite web|title=July 1944|url=http://57thbombwing.com/340th_History/487th_History/transcripts/15_Hist_Jul_1944_transcript.pdf|publisher=57th Bomb Wing Association Website}}</ref> in December 1943 and went overseas in April 1944.{{sfn|Demirjian|1996|p=297}}

He was assigned as an aerial bombardier in the [[340th Flying Training Group|340th Bombardment Group]] (M), a B-25 Mitchell medium bomber group, in the [[Twelfth Air Force]] in the [[Mediterranean Theatre of World War II|Mediterranean theater]].{{sfn|Demirjian|1996|p=297}}

Genian's unit attacked German [[beachhead]] defenses while Allied assault troops opened the front in southern France, and then moved northward to destroy German communications.{{sfn|Demirjian|1996|p=297}}

| quote  = Mission 48 now. Thanks Mom for your letter in Armenian. It seems I haven't forgotten. I don't know what picture you're talking about in your last letter, but I guess the Sentinel and the Fresno Bee printed a picture of a bridge I bombed several months ago, and I guess the Army sent it to the papers...Everyone wants this war to end soon. We're all sick and tired of killing one another. Sometimes, I like awake at night just thinking about the people I've probably killed with my bombs, but then I say to myself, 'they're trying to get you too,' so I forget about it for awhile.

His unit then helped move the German forces out of Tunisia, Sicily and central Italy. The 340th was awarded the Presidential Unit Citation as a distinguished unit, both for outstanding support of the British Eighth Army and the United States Seventh Army in Sicily and for compiling a record of 100% target hits in a full month of operation.{{sfn|Demirjian|1996|p=297}}

Genian was awarded one of his six [[oak leaf clusters]] early in the spring of 1944.{{sfn|Demirjian|1996|p=297}}

In June 1944, Genian's unit helped break the stalemate on the [[Adolf Hitler Line]] below [[Rome]]. Their attacks on viaducts and rail and road bridges were part of the "bridge-busting" missions that cut off the German supply lines and enabled Allied ground forces to push the Germans back above Rome.{{sfn|Demirjian|1996|p=297}}

He was awarded the Air Medal for meritorious service on June 22, 1944.{{sfn|Demirjian|1996|p=297}}

A month later, Genian was awarded the Soldier's Medal for heroism when, after discovering that three 100-pound bombs had failed to release, he lowered himself into his plane's bomb bay and, while being held in a precarious position, loosened and jettisoned the bombs.{{sfn|Demirjian|1996|p=299}}

| quote  = Carl never went into detail about any of his missions. The only way we ever knew anything was by way of the Air Force's many articles about him in our home town paper of that of the [[Fresno Bee]]. In every letter he wrote when he had just returned from a mission, he said simply, 'I can't bring myself to talk about it (the mission) and perhaps, when I come, I might.' Actually, when he came home, none of us felt comfortable asking him any questions about missions because he was still feeling the effects of all he had undergone. Unfortunately, his stories went untold.

That same month, during one of Genian's bombing runs over Germany, his plane was hit by German ground fire. Genian's plane had one of its two engines knocked out and was forced to make an emergency landing at an airstrip under Russian control. The Russian soldiers rushed out, picked up the American airmen and took them to an Army camp. Genian was put in a cabin until the Russians contacted the U.S. Air Force Headquarters to notify them of the crew's internment. During his internment, Genian had the opportunity to meet with Soviet Armenian General [[Marshal Baghramyan]].{{sfn|Demirjian|1996|p=299}} At that time, Baghramyan had become the commander of the First Baltic Front (later known as the Samland group). After the war, he was appointed Commander of the Baltic Military District. After Baghramyan and Genian had a conversation in Armenian, the general ordered his aide to inform the camp commander that every camp courtesy be given to the American airmen.{{sfn|Demirjian|1996|p=299}}

On October 12, 1944, Genian was able to guide his pilot to the successful completion of a mission over [[Bologna]], [[Italy]], despite the fact that the plane was heavily damaged from German anti-aircraft fire. For these actions, he was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross.{{sfn|Demirjian|1996|p=302}}{{sfn|Armenian General Benevolent Union|1951|p=103}}
