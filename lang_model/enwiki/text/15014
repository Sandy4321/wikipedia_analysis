A '''planetary mnemonic''' is a phrase used to remember the [[planet]]s and [[dwarf planet]]s of the [[Solar System]], with the order of words corresponding to increasing [[orbital period|sidereal periods]] of the bodies. One simple visual mnemonic is to hold out both hands side-by-side with fingers spread and thumbs in the same direction, with the fingers of one hand representing the [[terrestrial planets]], and the other hand the [[gas giants]]. The first thumb represents the [[Sun]] and [[asteroid belt]], including [[Ceres (dwarf planet)|Ceres]], and the second thumb represents the asteroid belt and [[trans-Neptunian object]]s, including [[Pluto]].

==Nine planets==
A common [[English language|English-language]] [[mnemonic]] for many years was "My Very Energetic (or Excellent, etc.) Mother Just Served Us Nine Pizzas" (for [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]] [[Venus]] [[Earth]] [[Mars]] [[Jupiter]] [[Saturn]] [[Uranus]] [[Neptune]] [[Pluto]]). Other mnemonics include "My Very Easy Method Just Shows Us Nine Planets", "My Very Energetic Mother Jumps Skateboards Under Nana's Patio" or "Mary's violet eyes make Johnny stay up nights plenty",<ref name="sandt080229">{{cite news |url=http://www.skyandtelescope.com/news/16078757.html |title=Of Planets and Palace Elephants |work=SkyandTelescope.com |first=Kelly |last=Beatty |date=2008-02-28 |accessdate=2008-09-16}}</ref> and "My Very Easy Method Just Speeds Up Naming Planets".  However, these mnemonics were made obsolete by the [[2006 definition of planet]], which reclassified Pluto (as well as [[Ceres (dwarf planet)|Ceres]] and [[Eris (dwarf planet)|Eris]]) as a dwarf planet.

==Eight planets==

When Pluto was demoted from full "planethood", mnemonics could no longer include the final "P".  The first notable suggestion came from Kyle Sullivan of [[Lumberton, Mississippi]] whose mnemonic was published in the Jan. 2007 issue of Astronomy magazine: "My Violent Evil Monster Just Scared Us Nuts".<ref>{{cite web|title=Physics 110 Astronomy Mnemonics |publisher= www.csub.edu/Physics |url=http://www.csub.edu/Physics/phys110/Mnemonics.html}}</ref> The [[International Astronomical Union]] suggested a revised mnemonic, ''My Very Educated Mother Just Served Us Nachos'', for the eight planets recognized under the new definition.<ref name="iau060824">{{cite web |url=http://www.iau.org/public_press/news/release/iau0603/questions_answers/ |title=Questions and Answers on Planets |accessdate=2008-09-23 |work=News Release - IAU0603: IAU 2006 General Assembly: Result of the IAU Resolution votes |publisher=IAU.org |date=2006-08-24 }}</ref> Others angry at the IAU's decision to "demote" Pluto composed sarcastic mnemonics in protest. [[Schott's Miscellany]] by [[Ben Schott]] included the mnemonic, ''Many Very Educated Men Justify Stealing Unique Ninth''.<ref name=SM>{{cite book |last= Schott|first= Ben|authorlink= Ben Schott |title= "Schott's Miscellany 2009" |publisher= Bloomsbury USA|location= New York |date= 2008 |pages= 77 |isbn= 978-1-59691-382-0}}</ref> [[Michael E.

==Contests==
The [[National Geographic Society]] sponsored a contest for a new mnemonic of MVEMCJSUNPE, incorporating the then eleven known planets and dwarf planets, including Eris, Ceres, and the newly demoted Pluto.  On February 22, 2008, ''My Very Exciting Magic Carpet Just Sailed Under Nine Palace Elephants'', coined by 10-year-old Maryn Smith of [[Great Falls, Montana]], was announced as the winner.<ref name="ngc080229">{{cite press release |url=http://press.nationalgeographic.com/pressroom/index.jsp?pageID=pressReleases_detail&siteID=1&cid=1203698789748 |title=National Geographic Children's Books Announces Winner of New Planetary Mnemonic |publisher=NationalGeographic.com |date=2008-02-22 |accessdate=2008-09-16}}</ref>{{Dead link|date=September 2012}} The phrase was featured in the song ''11 Planets'' by [[Grammy Award|Grammy-nominated]] singer and songwriter [[Lisa Loeb]] and in the book ''11 Planets: A New View of the Solar System'' by David Aguilar (ISBN 978-1426302367).<ref name="ngk080923">{{cite web| url=http://kids.nationalgeographic.com/Stories/SpaceScience/Planet-song| title=Planet Song| publisher=Kids.NationalGeographic.com| accessdate=2008-09-23}} (The song may be heard on-line.)</ref>  Since the National Geographic competition, two additional bodies have been designated as dwarf planets, [[Makemake (dwarf planet)|Makemake]] and [[Haumea (dwarf planet)|Haumea]], on July 11 and September 17, 2008 respectively. A mnemonic including all five known dwarf planets would probably be "My Very Excellent Mother Constantly Just Serves Us Nine Pizzas, Hamburgers, Meatballs, and Eggplants."
