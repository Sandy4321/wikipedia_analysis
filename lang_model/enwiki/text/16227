'''Bakhdida''' ([[Syriac Language|Syriac]]:<big><big>{{lang|syr|<U+0712><U+0735><U+0713><U+0742><U+0715><U+071D><U+073C><U+0715><U+0735><U+0710>}}</big></big>, [[Arabic]]:<U+0628><U+062E><U+062F><U+064A><U+062F><U+0627> ) or '''Baghdeda''', also known as '''Qaraqosh''', '''Karakosh''' or '''Al-Hamdaniya Municipality''', is an [[Assyrian people|Assyrian]] town in the northern [[Iraq]] [[Ninawa Governorate]], located about 32&nbsp;km southeast of the city of [[Mosul]] amid agricultural lands, close to the ruins of the ancient Assyrian cities [[Nimrud]] and [[Nineveh]]. It is connected to the main city of Mosul by two main roads. The first runs through the towns of [[Bartella]] and [[Karamles]] which connects to the city of [[Arbil]] as well. The second which was gravel until the 1990s when it was paved, is direct to Mosul.

==Etymology==
The name '''Bakhdida''' ({{lang-syr|<U+0712><U+071D><U+072C> <U+071F><U+0718><U+0715><U+071D><U+0715><U+0710>}}; '''Beth Khdeda'''), is of uncertain origin and when translated from the [[Syriac language]] it has two components ''Beth'' which means "land" or "town", and Khodida which could either mean "Youths" in [[Aramaic]] or "God's gift" in [[Old Persian]]. Some also believe that Bakhdida comes from the Aramaic ''Beth Deta'', meaning "Land of the [[Kite (bird)|Kite]]".<ref>[http://www.bakhdida.com/BehnamAtallah/Usool.htm <U+0627><U+0635><U+0648><U+0644> <U+0623><U+0633><U+0645><U+0627><U+0621> <U+0627><U+0644><U+0642><U+0631><U+0649> <U+0648><U+0627><U+0644><U+0645><U+0648><U+0627><U+0642><U+0639> <U+0627><U+0644><U+062A><U+0627><U+0628><U+0639><U+0629> <U+0644><U+0645><U+0646><U+0637><U+0642><U+0629> <U+0628><U+062E><U+062F><U+064A><U+062F><U+0627>], <U+0628><U+0647><U+0646><U+0627><U+0645> <U+0639><U+0637><U+0627><U+0627><U+0644><U+0644><U+0647></ref> During the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] Turks rule, the Turkish name '''Qara Qo<U+015F>''' ([[Turkish language|Turkish]] for ''black bird'') came into use. Finally, and as part of the [[Arabization]] policy in the 1970s, the Iraqi [[Ba'ath]] government changed the village name to '''Hamdaniyya''', naming it after the [[Arab tribe]] of "Banu Hamdan", who ruled [[Mosul]] in the [[middle ages]].

==Situation of the town==
Agriculture was the main source of living for the people of Bakhdida, It also prospered on handicrafts such as weaving and producing leather coats which are locally known as Farawee made of sheepskin. Today, Bakhdida has become a center of trade and business with many roads, shops, houses, buildings and lots of government employees but still agriculture and farming are one of the main sources of living as since the eighties many people own and run chicken farms with modern facilities.

The vast majority of its inhabitants are ethnic [[Assyrian people|Assyrians]], more than 90% of which are members of the [[Syriac Catholic Churches]], While the rest are [[Syriac Orthodox]]. The recent wave of violence targeting Christians in Iraq forced many Assyrians living in major Iraqi cities to move to Assyrians towns in [[Nineveh Plains]] which swelled the town with an influx of [[Iraqi refugees|refugees]] mainly belonging to the [[Chaldean Catholic Church]] and the [[Assyrian Church of the East]].

The main language spoken is the Nineveh Plains variant of [[Syriac]], Which is almost identical to that spoken in other major Assyrian towns in the region, Like [[Alqosh]] and [[Tel Kepe]]. [[Arabic]] is also used as a second language. [[English language|English]] is widely understood by younger generations.

As of now, the Al-Hamdaniya Municipality also includes towns of [[Bartella]] and [[Karamlish]] and tens of other smaller [[Assyrian_settlements#Ninawa_Province|Assyrian villages]].

==History==
===Pre-Christian accounts===
[[Image:BM; RM6 - ANE, Assyrian Sculpture 14 West Wall (M + N) ~ Assyrian Empire + -Lamassu, Gates at Balawat, Relief Panel's) & Full Projection.3.JPG|right|thumb|250ppx|"Balawat Gates" displayed at the [[British Museum]]]]
It is thought that the incient city of ''Rasin'' mentioned in some texts was in Bakhdida.<ref name="sawt bakhdida">[http://www.bakhdida.net/Mathaf/MattiBabaTareekhBakh.htm <U+062A><U+0627><U+0631><U+064A><U+062E> <U+0628><U+062E><U+062F><U+064A><U+062F><U+0627>]<U+060C> <U+0645><U+062A><U+064A> <U+0628><U+0627><U+0628><U+0627><U+060C> <U+062C><U+0631><U+064A><U+062F><U+0629> (<U+0635><U+0648><U+062A> <U+0628><U+062E><U+062F><U+064A><U+062F><U+0627>) <U+0627><U+0644><U+0639><U+062F><U+062F> <U+0627><U+0644><U+0631><U+0627><U+0628><U+0639></ref> Furthermore the town is situated 5&nbsp;km north to [[Balawat]] were important [[Assyria]]n artifacts were found by the [[Assyrian people|Assyrian]] [[Assyriologist]] [[Hormuzd Rassam]], most of which is sidplayed at the [[British Museum]] and the [[Louvre]].
A variant of the its name, ''Bakdedu'' is said to be the place of a decisive battle between the [[Assyria]]ns and the [[Babylonians]] in [[610 BC]] after the [[fall of Nineveh]].

The town then became part of the consecutive empires that ruled the region. Persian influence can be still seen by the possible explanation of its name. Many Gods worshipped before Christianity was established were of [[Assyria]]n and [[Persia]]n origins.

===Early Christian history===
The Assyrians of Bakhdida became Christians during early Christianity. With the Christological disputes of the 4th century, they followed the [[Nestorian]] teaching but switched to the Jacobite (Orthodox Assyrian) rite through Shapur al-Baghdida in the 7th century. Worth mentioning that Bartella was Nestorian village as well; however, the efforts of Bishop Gabriel al-Sinjari, in early 7th century, switched it to [[Jacobite Church|Jacobite]] as he held a special place at the Sassanid [[Persian Empire|Persian]] royal court and King [[Khosrow II]] and his queen Sherin. Gabriel was a Jacobite; however, he switched to Nestorianism when he married a Nestorian woman. He then married two additional Magian wives that led to his excommunication by the Nestorian patriarch; thus, he joined the Jacobite Church for the second time. Gabriel was influential at the court of the king and his wife because he has cured the queen and she had a child after years of unsuccessful pregnancy. His influence was so great that he prevented the Nestorians from electing a patriarch for 20 years.

===Later migrations===
Bakhdida's population is indigenous to the village; however, Assyrian Christians from other regions of Assyria have moved to and settled in Bakhdida. In 1089, the [[Church of Mar Aho Dama]] in [[Tikrit]] (built before 10th century) was looted and taxes on its Jacobite population became so unbearable that most of the Assyrian Christians left the city and the Jacobite [[Mapharian]], [[Youhanna IV Saliba]], followed suit and moved to Mosul. Many of these Tikriti Christians moved to Baghdeda and later few Mapharians settled in it as well. Still, the town would be a great anthropological study with many rooted family names such as Assu, Ashu, Ballu, Gadju, Hallu, Jadju, Olo, Rammu, that reflect Assyrian [[Akkadian]] influence.

===Raids of Persians and Kurds===

In their literature and writings, the Assyrians of Baghdida remember vividly the raids of the Persians and Kurds on their village and churches. In 1171, while the governors of Mosul and Damascus were fighting each other, the Kurds used the opportunity and attacked [[Mar Mattai Monastery]].<ref>[http://books.google.com/books?id=DVcZAAAAIAAJ&q=Kurds+Mar+Mattai&dq=Kurds+Mar+Mattai The chronography of Gregory Ab<U+00FB>'l Faraj, the son of Aaron, the Hebrew physician]</ref> According the 12th century writer [[Bar Hebraeus]], in 1261, the Kurds came down to Mosul and killed many Christians who refused to follow Islam and looted their homes and churches. The Kurds then occupied the Nunnery of Muqortaya and killed many of the nuns and others who have sought refuge in the monastery. In 1288, a battle took place between the Kurds and [[Tatars]] near Baghdida. In 1324, Baghdida was attacked by the Kurds again and many homes and four churches were burned.<ref>Bar Hebraius, Summary of the History of the lands,  Arabic edition P. 492-497</ref> In 1742, the [[Afsharids]] led by [[Nadir Shah]] plundered and looted the whole region of [[Mosul Vilayet]], including many Christian villages.<ref name="christiansofiraq">[http://www.chaldeansonline.org/village/bakhdida.htm Chaldean Towns of Northern Mesopotamia], Chaldeans On Line </ref>

===Advent of Catholicism===
In 1580, certain Jacobites of Bakhdida began to build relations with Rome through the Monastery of Mar Bihnam, but it was not until the 18th century that these Jacobites began to join the Vatican and became known as [[Syriac Catholic Church|Syrian Catholics]]. Recently, the Dominicans celebrated 250 years of their presence in north of Iraq. There was much unrest between the new Catholics and the originally Jacobite Christians. It is reported that when a Catholic bishop Essa Mahfoodh went to see the Jacobite Patriarch Elias II Hindi al-Mosulli (1837<U+2013>1847) in order to secure the division of properties between the two groups, he was received with insulting remarks. The patriarch told the Catholic bishop: "French (Papists), isn't it enough that you divided my people in Mardin and now you come here to Mosul as well to do the same thing here?" Backed by the French, the bishop went to Mohammad pasha, the Turkish governor, and presented his complaint to him. In 1837, the properties (churches and monasteries), manuscripts, and furniture were divided in a special manner between the two Assyrian denominations.

===Persian-Ottoman wars===
In early 18th century, the Persians under the leadership of [[Nader Shah]] invaded the Mosul region and most of the inhabitants of Baghdida escaped to Mosul with all their valuables, in accordance to the governor's orders. Mosul was harassed and then sieged for months. However, the Christians defended it and after months of blockade, the Persians finally signed a peace agreement with Mosul's governor Hasan Pasha [[Al Jalili]], and withdrew in 1743. To reward the Christians for their bravery, the Jalili governor permitted many churches in the Mosul region to be restored.<ref>{{cite web|author=Ghassan Hanna |url=http://www.chaldeansonline.org/village/bakhdida.html |title=Bakhdida |publisher=Chaldeansonline.org |date= |accessdate=2010-12-01}}</ref>

Next, the governor sent his son to [[Constantinople]] (Istanbul) to meet with the Ottoman Sultan [[Mahmud I]]. The purpose for the visit was to ask the sultan for a reward for saving Mosul. The sultan issued an official [[Firman]] in 1778 and paid ''Hussein Pasha al-Jalili'' 800 Qirsh to buy the village of Baghdida. The people of Baghdida were very upset about what had happened. They met and decided after long deliberation to abandon the village. When al-Jalili heard the story, he felt guilty and decided to return the ownership of the village to its rightful owners. He issued a decree in 1778, in which he relinquished his ownership to Baghdida, however, he kept his rights to receive the tenth of its produce in taxes.

This continued until Ayyoub al-Jalili headed the [[Jalili]] family. He tried to enforce the Sultan's original firman; however, the people of Bakhdida, as it was known at this time, fought with the help of ''Bihnam Bounni'', who won the case in Mosul courts in 1920 and traveled to Istanbul and won the case there in 1923. Nevertheless, ''Ayyoub al-Jalili'' and the Jalili family returned again and tried to claim ownership of Bakhdida. On [[21 November]] [[1949]] , judge ''Moslih al-Den al-Salhani'' rewarded Bakhdida to the Jalili family. The people of Bakhdida applied a petition to the Iraqi government in which they explained the whole history of their village and ended the petition with permission to leave Iraq if the government did not return ownership of the village to them. The courts looked into the matter one last time and on [[March 15]] [[1954]] , rewarded the village to the people of Bakhdida.

==Archaeology==
Since the late 19th century various locations on the outskirts of the town were excavated by [[Hormuzd Rassam]]. In [[Balawat]] (the ancient Assyrian city of Imgur-Enlil), a number of Assyrian artifacts was excaveted, which are currently displayed in the [[British Museum]] and [[Mosul Museum]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights/article_index/b/balawat_ancient_imgur-enlil.aspx |title=Balawat (ancient Imgur-Enlil, Iraq) |publisher=British Museum |date= |accessdate=2010-12-01}}</ref>
There is a lot of interest in the archaeology of Baghdida today. It has many Assyrian archaeological remains, like those of Tell Bashmoni (Beth Shmoni), tell Muqortaya, tell Karamles, tell Mar Bihnam and others. These mounds were fortresses, temples, or buildings that belonged to the Assyrian capital of [[Nimrud]]. Throughout 1922, 1927, and 1935, excavators found gold pieces, cylinder seals, and they found an Assyrian statue in a well in the church of Mar Zina, which is displayed in Mosul Museum. In 1942, an Assyrian bathroom and several graves were found near the church of Bashmoni. Furthermore, during the 1980s excavations in the grounds of the Church of Mar Youhanna (Saint John), archaeologists found human remains inside graves in the eastern side and at a depth of one and a half meters. These graves were built with typical Assyrian large sized rectangular shaped bricks.

References to Athur (Assyria) continued in texts from Baghdeda. Mapharian Athanasius Ibrahim II of Tur Abdin visited Tikrit, Baghdad, and Arbil to attend to his congregation. According to Afram Abdal al-Khouri and his book ''al-Lu'lu' al-Nadheed fi Tareekh Deir Mar Bihnam al-Shaheed'' (''The Layers of Pearls in the History of the Monastery of Martyred Mar Bihnam''), 1951, p.&nbsp;219, Sony writes: "in 1365, the mapharian came to Athur or Mosul and was welcomed by Nour al-Din the Chief of Baghdeda <U+2026>" (Sony 1998, 699). Lastly but not least, according to Mar Bihnam monastery archives, Sony writes that in 1294<U+2013>1295, a certain king "came to Lower Athur, the city of Saint Mar Bihnam <U+2026>" (Sony 1998, 95).
