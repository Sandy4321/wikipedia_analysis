The '''New England Hurricane of 1938''' (or '''Great New England Hurricane''' or '''Long Island Express''' or simply '''The Great Hurricane of 1938''') was the first major [[hurricane]] to strike [[New England]] since 1869. The storm formed near the coast of [[Africa]] in September of the [[1938 Atlantic hurricane season]], becoming a Category&nbsp;5 hurricane on the [[Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale]] before making landfall as a Category&nbsp;3 hurricane <ref>[http://www2.sunysuffolk.edu/mandias/38hurricane/ The Great Hurricane of 1938 - The Long Island Express]</ref> on [[Long Island]] on [[September 21]]. The hurricane killed over 682 people,<ref>{{cite news | first=R.

==Meteorological history==
{{storm path|1938 New England hurricane track.png}}

The storm formed as a [[Cape Verde-type hurricane]] in the eastern [[Atlantic Ocean]].  It reached Category&nbsp;5 status east of the [[Bahamas]] around [[September 20]] before turning northward.

This storm was extremely unusual in that its forward speed approached 70&nbsp;mph (110 [[km/h]]). The unusual rapid movement allowed the hurricane to travel far to the north before it had a chance to weaken over cooler waters<ref>NOAA website: [http://www.erh.noaa.gov/box/hurricane1938.htm THE GREAT NEW ENGLAND HURRICANE of 1938]</ref> and earned it the nickname "Long Island Express."

The hurricane was forecast by the U.S. [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration|National Weather Service]] to curve out into the Atlantic Ocean but instead continued almost due north. It made landfall in [[Suffolk County, New York|Suffolk County]] on [[Long Island]], [[New York]] on [[September 21]], [[1938]] as a strong Category&nbsp;3 hurricane on the present-day [[Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale]] with a central pressure of 946 [[Bar (unit)|mbar]] ([[pascal (unit)|hPa]]).<ref>[http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/pastint.shtml The Most Intense Hurricanes in the United States 1851-2004]</ref> It then traveled across [[Long Island Sound]] into [[Connecticut]], [[Rhode Island]], [[Massachusetts]], [[New Hampshire]], [[Vermont]], and finally into [[Canada]] while still moving at an unusually high speed.<ref>PBS [http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/hurricane38/maps/index.html The Hurricane of '38]</ref>

The hurricane hit Long Island around 3:30 p.m., which was just a few hours before astronomical [[high tide]]. At this time the eye was about {{convert|50|mi|km|0}} across and the hurricane was about {{convert|500|mi|km|-1}} wide.<ref>[http://www2.sunysuffolk.edu/mandias/38hurricane/weather_history_38.html The Long Island Express: The Great Hurricane of 1938]</ref>

==Impact==
{{Costliest U.S. Atlantic hurricanes by wealth normalization}}
[[Image:Sep1938filledrainblk.gif|left|thumb|Rainfall from Long Island Express Hurricane]]

The majority of the storm damage was from [[storm surge]] and wind.  Damage is estimated at $6&nbsp;billion (2004 [[United States dollar|USD]]),<ref>[http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/pastcost2.shtml Costliest U.S. Hurricanes 1900-2004 (adjusted)]</ref> making it among the most costly hurricanes to strike the U.S. mainland.  It is estimated that if an identical hurricane struck today it would cause $39.2&nbsp;billion (2005&nbsp;USD) in damage.<ref>[http://www.aoml.noaa.gov/hrd/tcfaq/costliesttable3.html Ranked Using 2005 Inflation, Population, and Wealth Normalization]</ref>

Approximately 600&nbsp;people died in the storm in New England, most in [[Rhode Island]], and up to 100&nbsp;people elsewhere in the path of the storm.<ref>[http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/pastdeadlyapp1.shtml The Deadliest Atlantic Tropical Cyclones, 1492-1996]</ref> An additional 708&nbsp;people were reported injured.<ref>[http://www2.sunysuffolk.edu/mandias/38hurricane/damage_caused.html Damage Caused by Storm]</ref>

In total, 4,500&nbsp;cottages, farms, and other homes were reported destroyed. An additional 25,000 homes were damaged. Other damages included 26,000&nbsp;automobiles destroyed, and 20,000&nbsp;electrical poles toppled.  The hurricane also devastated the forests of the Northeast, knocking down an estimated 2 billion trees in New York and New England.<ref>http://www2.sunysuffolk.edu/mandias/38hurricane/damage_caused.html</ref>
Freshwater flooding was minimal, however, as the quick passage of the storm decreased local rainfall totals, with only a few small areas receiving over 10&nbsp;inches (250&nbsp;mm) of rain.

===New York===
On Long Island, the storm obliterated the Dune Road area of [[Westhampton Beach, New York|Westhampton Beach]], resulting in 29 deaths. A cinema at Westhampton was also lifted out to sea: around 20 people at a matinee, and the theater &mdash; projectionist and all &mdash; landed two miles (3&nbsp;km) into the [[Atlantic]] and drowned.<ref>Alistair Cooke, 'Hurricanes,' 23 September 1988, ''Letter from America'' (Penguin: London, 2004)</ref> There were 21 other deaths through the rest of the east end of Long Island. The storm surge temporarily turned [[Montauk, New York|Montauk]] into an island as it flooded across the South Fork at [[Napeague, New York|Napeague]] and obliterated the tracks of the [[Long Island Rail Road]].

The surge rearranged the sand at the Cedar Point Lighthouse so that the island became connected to what is now [[Cedar Point County Park]]. The surging water created the present-day [[Shinnecock Inlet]] by carving out a large section of barrier island separating Shinnecock Bay from the Atlantic Ocean. The storm toppled the landmark steeple of the tallest building in [[Sag Harbor, New York|Sag Harbor]] (the Whalers Church). The steeple has not been rebuilt. [[Wading River, New York|Wading River]] suffered substantial damage.

In Greenport, on the North Fork of Long Island, the storm blew down the movie theatre located on Front Street.

===Rhode Island===
[[Image:GHo1938damage.jpg|thumb|left|Damage in [[Portsmouth, Rhode Island|Island Park, Rhode Island]]]]

The storm surge hit [[Westerly, Rhode Island]] at 3:50  p.m. EDT, resulting in 100 deaths there alone.<ref name="hurr1938">[http://www.geocities.com/hurricanene/hurr1938.htm 1938 Hurricane - September 21, 1938]</ref>

The tide was even higher than usual because of the [[Autumnal Equinox]] and [[full moon]]. The hurricane produced storm tides of 14 to {{convert|18|ft|m|0}} across most of the Long Island and Connecticut coast, with 18 to {{convert|25|ft|m|0|sing=on}} tides from [[New London, Connecticut|New London]] east to [[Cape Cod]]. The storm surge was especially violent along the Rhode Island shore, sweeping hundreds of summer cottages out to sea. As the surge drove northward through [[Narragansett Bay]], it was restricted by the Bay's funnel shape, and rose to a level of nearly 16&nbsp;feet (15.8) feet above normal spring tides, resulting in more than {{convert|13|ft|m}} of water in some areas of Downtown [[Providence, Rhode Island|Providence]]. Several motorists were drowned in their autos.<ref name="Weather History of the '38 Hurricane">[http://www2.sunysuffolk.edu/mandias/38hurricane/weather_history_38.html Weather History of the '38 Hurricane]</ref> 

Many homes and structures along the coast were destroyed as well as many structures inland along the hurricane's path. Entire beach communities on the coast of Rhode Island were obliterated. Napatree Point, a small cape which housed nearly forty families located between the [[Atlantic Ocean]] and [[Little Narragansett Bay]] just off of [[Watch Hill, Rhode Island]], was completely swept away. Today, Napatree is wildlife refuge with no human inhabitants. The only structures lying directly on the coast that survived the storm were the immense stone mansions in [[Newport, Rhode Island|Newport]], mostly because the largest mansions were located along the [[Cliff Walk]], high above the waves, though several, including [[The Breakers]] and [[Carey Mansion]] (known at that time as Seaview Terrace) still bear scars from the high winds of the storm.

One of the more tragic stories related to the storm was that of the seven children who died after driver [[Norman Caswell]] abandoned their school bus while trying to cross a narrow causeway known as Mackerel Cove in [[Jamestown, Rhode Island]]. Halfway through the cove, the bus stalled; the children evacuated and formed a human chain, believing they would be safer. The chain broke and the children were washed away, later to be found at various locations along Narragansett Bay.
The only survivors were Caswell and Clayton Chellis (whose sister perished and brother chose to ride home with friends instead, saving his life). Caswell was blamed by many in the town for the children's deaths, and never drove the bus again. {{Fact|date=November 2007}}

A few miles from Conanicus Island, keeper Walter Eberly lost his life when Whale Rock lighthouse was swept off its base and into the raging waves- his body was never found.

===Connecticut===

Eastern Connecticut was in the eastern side of the hurricane. Long Island acted as a buffer against large ocean surges, but the waters of Long Island Sound rose to unimaginable heights. Small shoreline towns to the east of New Haven had nearly complete destruction from the water and winds. To this day, the 1938 hurricane holds the record for the worst natural disaster in Connecticut's 350-year history.

In the beach towns of [[Clinton, Connecticut|Clinton]], [[Westbrook, Connecticut|Westbrook]], and [[Old Saybrook, Connecticut|Old Saybrook]], buildings were found as wreckage across coastal roads.  Actress [[Katharine Hepburn]] waded to safety from her [[Old Saybrook]] beach home narrowly escaping death. She stated in her 1991 book that 95% of her personal belongings were either lost or destroyed, including her 1932 [[Academy Award|Oscar]] which was later found intact.{{Fact|date=June 2008}} In [[Old Lyme, Connecticut|Old Lyme]], beach cottages were flattened or swept away. Along the Stonington shorefront, buildings were swept off their foundations and found two miles (3&nbsp;km) inland. Rescuers later searching for survivors in the homes in [[Mystic, Connecticut|Mystic]] found live fish and crabs in kitchen drawers and cabinets. 

[[New London, Connecticut|New London]] was first swept by the winds and storm surge; then the waterfront business district caught fire and burned out of control for 10 hours. Stately homes along [[Ocean Beach]] were leveled by the storm surge. The permanently anchored 240-ton lightship at the head of New London Harbor was found on a sand bar two miles (3&nbsp;km) away.

Interior sections of the state experienced widespread flooding as the hurricane's torrential rains fell on soil already saturated from previous storms.  The [[Connecticut River]] was forced out of its banks, inundating cities and towns from [[Hartford, Connecticut|Hartford]], to [[Middletown, Connecticut|Middletown]].

===Massachusetts===

The eye of the storm followed the Connecticut River north into Massachusetts, where the winds and flooding killed 99 people. In Springfield, the river rose to 6 to {{convert|10|ft|m|0}} above flood stage, causing significant damage. Up to six inches (152&nbsp;mm)  of rain fell across Western MA, which combined with over four inches (102&nbsp;mm)  that had fallen a few days earlier produced widespread flooding. Residents of Ware were stranded for days, and relied on air-dropped food and medicine. After the flood receded, the town's Main Street was left a chasm in which sewer pipes could be seen. 

To the east, the surge left Falmouth and New Bedford under eight feet of water. Two-thirds of all the boats in New Bedford harbor sank. The [[Blue Hill Meteorological Observatory|Blue Hills Observatory]] registered sustained winds of 121&nbsp;mph (195&nbsp;km/h) and a peak gust of 186&nbsp;mph (299&nbsp;km/h).

The [[New Haven Railroad]] from New Haven to Providence was particularly hard hit, as countless bridges along the [[Shore Line]] were destroyed or flooded, severing rail connections to badly affected cities (such as Westerly) in the process.

===New Hampshire===
In [[New Hampshire]], there was less damage than in other states. Only one inch (25&nbsp;mm) of rain fell in [[Concord, New Hampshire|Concord]].{{Fact|date=November 2007}} But [[Peterborough, New Hampshire|Peterborough]] was worse; total damage there was stated to be $500,000 (1938&nbsp;USD, $6.5&nbsp;million 2005&nbsp;USD) and swept away 10 bridges. In all of New Hampshire, 13 people met their deaths.
