'''''Jonathan Strange & Mr Norrell''''' is the first novel by British writer [[Susanna Clarke]]. An [[alternate history]] set in nineteenth-century England during the [[Napoleonic Wars]], it is  based on the premise that magic once existed in England and has returned with two men: Gilbert Norrell and Jonathan Strange. The novel concerns itself mostly with the relationship between these two men, but it also investigates the nature of "Englishness" and the boundary between reason and madness. It has been described as a [[fantasy]] novel, an alternate history, and an [[historical novel]].

The narrative draws on various [[Romanticism|Romantic]] literary traditions, such as the [[comedy of manners]], the [[Gothic fiction|Gothic tale]], and the [[Byronic hero]]. The novel's language is a [[pastiche]] of nineteenth-century writing styles, such as those of [[Jane Austen]] and [[Charles Dickens]]. Clarke describes the supernatural with mundane details and combines arch wit with antiquarian quaintness. She supplements the text with almost 200 footnotes, outlining the backstory and an entire [[Fictional books in the works of Susanna Clarke|fictional corpus of magical scholarship]].

Clarke began writing ''Jonathan Strange & Mr Norrell'' in 1993; ten years later she submitted the manuscript for publication. It was accepted by [[Bloomsbury Publishing|Bloomsbury]] and published in September 2004, with illustrations by [[Portia Rosenberg]]. Bloomsbury was so sure of its success that they printed 250,000 hardcover copies. The novel was well-received by critics and reached number three on the [[New York Times Best Seller list|''New York Times'' bestseller list]]. It was longlisted for the 2004 [[Booker Prize|Man Booker Prize]] and won the 2005 [[Hugo Award for Best Novel]].

=== Volume I: Mr Norrell ===
The novel opens in autumn 1806 in [[northern England]] with The Learned Society of [[York]] Magicians, made up of "theoretical magicians" who believe that magic died out several hundred years earlier. The group is stunned to learn of a "practising magician", Mr Gilbert Norrell, who owns a large collection of "books of magic" that he has spent years purchasing in order to keep out of the hands of others. Norrell proves his skill as a practical magician by making the statues in [[York Minster|York Cathedral]] speak. John Childermass, Mr Norrell's long-time servant, convinces a member of the group, John Segundus, to write about the event for the [[London]] newspapers.

Segundus's article generates considerable interest in Mr Norrell, who moves to London to revive practical English magic. He enters society with the help of two gentlemen about town and meets a [[Cabinet of the United Kingdom|Cabinet]] minister named Sir Walter Pole. To ingratiate himself, Mr Norrell attempts to recall Sir Walter's fianc<U+00E9>e, Emma Wintertowne, from the dead. He summons a fairy<U+2014>"the gentleman with thistle-down hair"<ref>Clarke, ''Jonathan Strange & Mr Norrell'', 88.</ref><U+2014>who strikes a bargain with Mr Norrell to restore Emma: half of her life will be spent with the fairy. After news spreads of Emma's resurrection and happy marriage to Sir Walter, magic becomes respectable and Mr Norrell performs various feats to aid the government in their [[Napoleonic Wars|ongoing war]] against [[Napoleon]]. 

While living in London, Mr Norrell encounters Vinculus, a street-magician, who relates a prophecy about a nameless slave and two magicians in England, but Norrell dismisses it. While travelling, Vinculus later meets Jonathan Strange, a young gentleman of property from [[Shropshire]], and recites the same prophecy, prompting Strange to become a magician. Meanwhile, the gentleman with thistle-down hair takes a liking to Stephen Black, Sir Walter's capable black butler, and promises to make him a king. Emma (now Lady Pole) lapses into lassitude. She rarely speaks, and her attempts to communicate her situation are confounded by magic. No doctor can cure her, and Mr Norrell claims that her problems cannot be solved by magic. Without the knowledge of the other characters, each evening she and Stephen are forced to attend balls held by the gentleman with thistle-down hair in the Faerie kingdom of Lost-Hope, where they dance all night long.

=== Volume II: Jonathan Strange ===

Volume II opens with Strange learning of Mr Norrell and travelling to London to meet him. They immediately clash over the importance of John Uskglass (the legendary Raven King) to English magic. Strange argues that "without the Raven King there would be no magic and no magicians" while Norrell retorts that the Raven King made war upon England and should be forgotten.<ref>Clarke, ''Jonathan Strange & Mr Norrell'', 244<U+2013>45.</ref> Despite their differing opinions and temperaments, Strange becomes Norrell's pupil. Norrell, however, deliberately keeps some knowledge from Strange. 

Lady Pole and Strange's wife, Arabella, become friends; several times Lady Pole attempts to tell Arabella about her forced nights of dancing at the fairy's castle in Lost-Hope, but each time she tells an unrelated story. Arabella also meets the gentleman with thistle-down hair at the Poles', but she assumes he is simply a resident. Without her husband's knowledge, the fairy plots to enchant her, although Stephen continually attempts to dissuade him.   

The Stranges become a popular couple in London. The Cabinet ministers find Strange easier to deal with than Norrell, and they send him to assist the [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|Duke of Wellington]] on his [[Peninsular War|Peninsular Campaign]]. For over a year, Strange helps the army: he creates roads, moves towns, and makes dead men speak. After he returns, he fails to cure [[George III of the United Kingdom|George III's]] madness, although Strange manages to save the king from becoming enchanted by the gentleman with thistle-down hair, who is determined to make Stephen a king. Strange then helps defeat Napoleon at the horrific [[Battle of Waterloo]].

Frustrated with being Norrell's pupil, Strange pens a scathing review of a book outlining Norrell's theories on modern magic; in particular, Strange challenges Norrell's views of the Raven King. The English public splits into "Norrellites" and "Strangites"; Norrell and Strange part company, although not without regret. Strange returns home and works on his own book, ''The History and Practice of English Magic''. Arabella goes missing, then suddenly reappears, sick and weak. Three days later she dies.

=== Volume III: John Uskglass ===

Volume III opens with Childermass experiencing strong magic that is not produced by either Norrell or Strange. At the same time, Lady Pole attempts to shoot Mr Norrell as he is returning home. Childermass takes the bullet himself but is not killed. Afterwards, Lady Pole is cared for in the country by John Segundus, who has an inkling of the magic surrounding her. During travels in the north, Stephen meets Vinculus, who recites his prophecy: "''the nameless slave shall be a king in a strange country''&nbsp;...&nbsp;"<ref>Clarke, ''Jonathan Strange & Mr Norrell'', 569.</ref> Stephen believes it applies to him, but the gentleman with thistle-down hair argues that it applies to the Raven King.

Strange settles in [[Venice]] and meets Flora Greysteel. They become fond of each other and Strange's friends believe he may marry again. He discovers however that Arabella is alive and being held captive in Faerie. Strange's strenuous efforts to rescue her take their toll: his letters to friends appear crazed, and he is soon surrounded by "Eternal Night"<U+2014>an eerie darkness that engulfs him and follows him wherever he goes<U+2014>after he successfully communicates with the gentleman with thistle-down hair.<ref>Clarke, ''Jonathan Strange & Mr Norrell'', 690.</ref> On Strange's orders, Flora moves with her family to [[Padua]] and secretes herself inside her home to wait for Arabella to appear. In England, there is a magical renaissance. Strange returns and gives Childermass instructions which allow him to free Lady Pole from the fairy's enchantment. Strange asks Norrell to help him undo Arabella's enchantment by summoning John Uskglass. Although they initially believe that they have succeeded, they later come to believe that their contact with John Uskglass was accidental. As a result of their magics, Strange and Norrell remain bound together<U+2014>they cannot leave the "Eternal Night" or each other. They do succeed in sending Arabella to Padua, where Flora is waiting for her. After the spells of the gentleman with thistle-down hair are broken, Stephen becomes the king of the Faerie domain, Lost-Hope.

==Composition and publication==
[[File:Susanna Clarke March 2006.jpg|thumb|upright|In an interview, [[Susanna Clarke]] said: "I have a fascination with magicians. I always liked them in the books I read by authors like [[C.S. Lewis]] and [[J.R.R. Tolkien]] <U+2013> the [[The Chronicles of Narnia|Narnia Chronicles]] were my favourite as a child."<ref name=DSmith/>]]

Clarke first developed the idea for ''Jonathan Strange & Mr Norrell'' during a year spent teaching English in [[Bilbao, Spain]]: "I had a kind of waking dream&nbsp;...&nbsp;about a man in 18th century clothes in a place rather like Venice, talking to some English tourists. And I felt strongly that he had some sort of magical background <U+2013> he'd been dabbling in magic, and something had gone badly wrong."<ref name=Grossman>Lev Grossman, [http://www.time.com/time/printout/0,8816,678627,00.html "Of Magic and Men"], ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' (8 August 2004). Retrieved 5 January 2009.</ref>

After she returned from Spain in 1993, Clarke began to think seriously about writing her novel. She signed up for a five-day fantasy and science-fiction writing workshop, co-taught by writers [[Colin Greenland]] and [[Geoff Ryman]]. The students were expected to prepare a short story before attending, but Clarke only had "bundles" of material for her novel. From this she extracted "[[The Ladies of Grace Adieu and Other Stories|The Ladies of Grace Adieu]]", a story about three women secretly practising magic who are discovered by the famous Jonathan Strange.<ref name=Hodgman>John Hodgman, [http://www.nytimes.com/2004/08/01/magazine/01CLARKE.html?ex=1249099200&en=2fea0b3cbfbd17d9&ei=5090&partner=rssuserland&pagewanted=all "Susanna Clarke's Magic Book"], ''[[New York Times Magazine]]'' (1 August 2004). Retrieved 5 January 2009.</ref> Greenland was so impressed with the story that, without Clarke's knowledge, he sent an excerpt to his friend, the fantasy writer [[Neil Gaiman]]. Gaiman later said, "It was terrifying from my point of view to read this first short story that had so much assurance&nbsp;...&nbsp;It was like watching someone sit down to play the piano for the first time and she plays a sonata."<ref name=Hodgman/> Gaiman showed the story to his friend, science-fiction writer and editor [[Patrick Nielsen Hayden]]. Clarke learned of these events when Hayden called and offered to publish her story in his anthology ''[[Starlight (anthology series)|Starlight 1]]'', which featured pieces by well-regarded science-fiction and fantasy writers.<ref name=Hodgman/> She accepted, and the book won the [[World Fantasy Award]] for best anthology in 1997.<ref>[http://www.worldfantasy.org/awards/awardslist.html World Fantasy Awards]. www.worldfantasy.org. Retrieved 13 January 2009.</ref>

Clarke spent the next ten years working on the novel in her spare time, while editing cookbooks full-time for [[Simon & Schuster]] in [[Cambridge]].<ref name=WGrossman>Wendy Grossman, "Ten years &mdash; but Susanna's book is worth the wait", ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' (7 October 2004).

Rather than writing the novel from beginning to end, she wrote in fragments and attempted to stitch them together.<ref name=Rose/> Clarke, admitting that the project was for herself and not the reader,<ref name=Silver1/> "clung to this method" "because I felt that if I went back and started at the beginning, [the novel] would lack depth, and I would just be skimming the surface of what I could do. But if I had known it was going to take me ten years, I would never have begun. I was buoyed up by thinking that I would finish it next year, or the year after next."<ref name=Rose/> Clarke and Greenland fell in love while she was writing the novel and moved in together.<ref name=Hodgman/> Greenland did not read the novel until it was published.<ref name=Silver2>Steven H.

He writes that "Austen gets down to business briskly, while Clarke engages in a curious narrative strategy of continual deferral and delay".<ref name=Feeley>Gregory Feeley, [http://www.weeklystandard.com/Utilities/printer_preview.asp?idArticle=4754&R=160D02A57C "The Magic of England"], ''[[The Weekly Standard]]'' (18 October 2004). Retrieved 5 January 2009.</ref> For example, Clarke mentions Jonathan Strange on the first page of the novel, but only in a footnote. He reappears in other footnotes throughout the opening but does not appear as a character in the text proper until a quarter of the way through the novel.<ref name=Feeley/>

In ''Jonathan Strange & Mr Norrell'', Clarke infuses her dry wit with prosaic quaintness. For example, the narrator notes: "It has been remarked (by a lady infinitely cleverer than the present author) how kindly disposed the world in general feels to young people who either die or marry. Imagine then the interest that surrounded Miss Wintertowne! No young lady ever had such advantages before: for she died upon the Tuesday, was raised to life in the early hours of Wednesday morning, and was married upon the Thursday; which some people thought too much excitement for one week." As [[Michel Faber]] explains in his review for ''[[The Guardian]]'', "here we have all the defining features of Clarke's style simultaneously: the archly Austenesque tone, the somewhat overdone quaintness ("upon the Tuesday"), the winningly matter-of-fact use of the supernatural, and drollness to spare."<ref name=Faber> Michel Faber, [http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2004/oct/02/featuresreviews.guardianreview20 "It's a kind of magick"], ''[[The Guardian]]'' (2 October 2004). Retrieved 5 January 2009.</ref> [[Gregory Maguire]] notes in ''[[The New York Times]]'' that Clarke even gently ridicules the genre of the novel itself: "[Mr Norrell] picks up a book and begins to read&nbsp;...&nbsp;but he is not attending to what he reads and he has got to Page 22 before he discovers it is a novel <U+2013> the sort of work which above all others he most despises <U+2013> and he puts it down in disgust." Elsewhere, the narrator remarks, "Dear Emma does not waste her energies upon novels like other young women."<ref name=Maguire/>

Clarke's style extends to the novel's 185 footnotes,<ref name=Hendrix>Grady Hendrix, [http://www.villagevoice.com/2004-08-24/books/do-you-believe-in-magic/1 "Do You Believe in Magic?"], ''[[The Village Voice]]'' (24 August 2004). Retrieved 5 January 2009.</ref> which document a meticulous invented history of English magic. At times, the footnotes dominate entire pages of the novel. Michael Dirda, in his review for ''[[The Washington Post]]'', describes these notes as "dazzling feats of imaginative scholarship", in which the anonymous narrator "provides elaborate mini-essays, relating anecdotes from the lives of semi-legendary magicians, describing strange books and their contents, speculating upon the early years and later fate of the Raven King".<ref name=Dirda>Michael Dirda, [http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn/A57806-2004Sep2?language=printer "Jonathan Strange and Mr Norrell"], ''[[The Washington Post]]'' (5 September 2004).

Feeley explains that [[Romantic poetry|Romantic poet]] [[John Keats|John Keats<U+2019>s]] "vision of  enchantment and devastation following upon any dealings with ''faeries''" informs the novel, as the passing reference to the "cold hillside" makes clear.<ref name=Feeley/><ref>The reference is to Keats's poem "[[La Belle Dame sans Merci]]".

Reviewers variously describe ''Jonathan Strange & Mr Norrell'' as a [[fantasy]] novel, an [[alternate history]], an [[historical fiction]], or as a combination of these styles. Clarke herself says, "I think the novel is viewed as something new&nbsp;...&nbsp;blending together a few genres <U+2013> such as fantasy and adventure and pastiche historical <U+2013> plus there's the whole thing about slightly knowing footnotes commenting on the story."<ref name=FreemanInterview/> She explains in an interview that she was particularly influenced by the historical fiction of [[Rosemary Sutcliff]] as well as the fantasies of [[Ursula LeGuin]] and [[Alan Garner]], and that she loves the works of Austen.<ref name=Hodgman/>

In his review for ''[[The Boston Globe]]'', John Freeman observes that Clarke<U+2019>s fantasy, like that of [[Franz Kafka]] and [[Neil Gaiman]], is imbued with [[Literary realism|realism]]. He argues that the footnotes in particular lend an air of credibility to the narrative: for example, they describe a fictional biography of Jonathan Strange and list where particular paintings in Norrell<U+2019>s house are located.<ref name=FreemanReview>John Freeman, "Magic to do: Faux footnotes, social observation, and wizard rivalry stir the pot in Susanna Clarke's 19th-century tale", ''[[The Boston Globe]]'' (3 October 2004).

Silver, [http://www.sfsite.com/02a/su193.htm "An Interview with Susanna Clarke, Part I"], www.sfsite.com (October 2004). Retrieved 25 January 2009.</ref> This realism has led other reviewers, such as Polly Shulman, to argue that Clarke<U+2019>s book is more of an historical fiction, akin to the works of [[Patrick O<U+2019>Brian]]. As she explains, "Both Clarke's and O'Brian's stories are about a complicated relationship between two men bound together by their profession; both are set during the Napoleonic wars; and they share a dry, melancholy wit and unconventional narrative shape."<ref name=Shulman/> Shulman sees fantasy and historical fiction as similar because both must follow rigid rules or risk a breakdown of the narrative.<ref name=Shulman/>

As well as literary styles, Clarke pastiches many [[Romanticism|Romantic]] literary genres: the [[comedy of manners]], the [[Gothic fiction|Gothic tale]], the [[Fashionable novel|silver-fork novel]], the military adventure, the [[Byronic hero]], and the historical romance of [[Walter Scott]].<ref name=Dirda/> In fact, Clarke's novel maps the literary history of the early nineteenth century: the novel begins with the style and genres of [[British Regency|Regency England]], an "Austenian world of light, bright, sparkling dialogue and well-mannered gentility", and gradually transforms into a dark, [[Lord Byron|Byronic]] tale.<ref name=Bander>Elaine Bander, [http://www.jasna.org/persuasions/on-line/vol29no1/bander.html "Miss J.

==Themes==
===Friendship===
Reviewers focus most frequently on the dynamic between Norrell and Strange, arguing that the novel is about their relationship.<ref name=Hendrix/> In her review for the ''[[Times Literary Supplement]]'', Roz Kaveney writes that the two illustrate [[Harold Bloom]]'s notion of the "[[The Anxiety of Influence|anxiety of influence]]" in addition to [[romantic friendship]].<ref>Roz Kaveney, "The gentleman with thistledown hair", ''[[Times Literary Supplement]]'' (1 October 2004).</ref> The two are a "study in contrasts", with Norrell "exceptionally learned but shy and fussy" while Strange is "charming, young, fashionable and romantic".<ref name=Grossman/>  As one reviewer remarks, "Clarke could have called the book ''[[Sense and Sensibility]]'' if the title weren't already taken."<ref name=Grossman/>

===Reason and madness===
The novel is not about the fight between good and evil but rather the differences between madness and reason<U+2014>and it is the fairy world that is connected to madness (mad people can see fairies, for example).<ref name=Shulman>Polly Shulman, [http://slate.msn.com/id/2106798 "Fantasy for Grown-ups"], ''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]'' (16 September 2004). Retrieved 5 January 2009.</ref> Lady Pole, who is taken away into the fairyland of Lost-Hope every night, appears insane to those around her. She is hidden away, like the character type examined by [[Sandra Gilbert]] and [[Susan Gubar]] in their seminal book ''[[The Madwoman in the Attic]]'' (1979). Developing a "divided consciousness", she is passive and quiet at home at the same time she is vengeful and murderous in the fairy land.<ref name=Hoiem/>

===Englishness===
[[File:FitzgeraldFairyBanquet.jpg|right|thumb|"Fairies' Banquet" (1859) by [[John Anster Fitzgerald]]]]
Clarke's book is identified as distinctively English not only because of its style but also because of its themes of "vigorous common sense", "firm ethical fiber", "serene reason and self-confidence", which are drawn from its [[Augustan literature|Augustan literary]] roots. The "muddy, bloody, instinctual spirit of the fairies" is equally a part of its Englishness, along with "arrogance, provincialism and class prejudice".<ref name=Miller/> The fairy tradition that Clarke draws on is particularly English; she alludes to tales from children's literature and others which date back to the medieval period. As Feeley notes, "The idea of fairies forming a hidden supernatural aristocracy certainly predates [[Edmund Spenser|Spenser]] and [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]], and seems to distinguish the English tales of wee folk from those of Scotland and Ireland."<ref name=Feeley/> In these medieval English stories, the fairies are depicted as "capricious, inconsistent in their attitude toward humankind, [and] finally unknowable", characteristics which Clarke integrates into her own fairies.<ref name=Feeley/> Clarke notes in an interview that she drew the idea of unpredictable, amoral fairies from the works of [[Neil Gaiman]].<ref name=Locus/>

In an interview with ''[[Locus (magazine)|Locus]]'', Clarke explains why and how she integrated the theme of "Englishness" into ''Jonathan Strange'': "I wanted to explore my ideas of the fantastic, as well as my ideas of England and my attachment to English landscape.&nbsp;...&nbsp;Sometimes it feels to me as though we don't have a fable of England, of Britain, something strong and idealized and romantic. I was picking up on things like [[G. K. Chesterton|Chesterton]] and [[Arthur Conan Doyle|Conan Doyle]], and the sense (which is also in Jane Austen) of what it was to be an English gentleman at the time when England was a very confident place".<ref name=Locus>[http://www.locusmag.com/2005/Issues/04Clarke.html "The Three Susanna Clarkes"], ''[[Locus (magazine)|Locus]]'' (April 2005) (subscription required). Retrieved 17 March 2009.</ref> In particular, "it's the sort of Englishness which is stuffy but fundamentally benevolent, and fundamentally very responsible about the rest of the world", which connects Conan Doyle's [[Sherlock Holmes]] to Clarke's Jonathan Strange.<ref name=Locus/>

===Historical otherness===
Using techniques of the genre of alternate history, Clarke creates events and characters that would have been impossible in the early nineteenth century. She also explores the "silencing" of underrepresented groups: women, people of colour, and poor whites.<ref name=Hoiem>Elizabeth Hoiem, [http://www.strangehorizons.com/2008/20081027/hoiem-a.shtml "The Fantasy of Talking Back: Susanna Clarke's Historical Present in ''Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell''"], ''[[Strange Horizons]]'' (27 October 2008). Retrieved 26 February 2009.</ref> Both Strange and Norrell suppress the voices of these groups in their rise to power. Mr Norrell, for example, attempts to buy up all the books of magic in England in order to keep anyone else from acquiring their knowledge. He also barters away half of Emma Wintertowne's (Lady Pole's) life for political influence, a deal about which she cannot speak coherently.<ref name=Hoiem/>

Clarke explores the limits of "English" magic through the characters of Stephen Black and Vinculus. As Clarke explains, "If you put a fairy next to a person who is also outside English society&nbsp;...&nbsp;suddenly the fact that there is this alien race seems more believable, because you've got another alien and the two of them can talk about the English in this very natural way."<ref name=Locus/> The gentleman with the thistle-down hair sees Stephen as a [[noble savage]] and enslaves him<U+2014>like Lady Pole, Stephen is silenced. Both "suffer under a silencing spell that mimics gaps in the historical record".<ref name=Hoiem/> Furthermore, the gentleman's desire to acquire Stephen for his dancing hall is reminiscent of the English objectification of black slaves.<ref name=Hoiem/> Stephen vows to hate all white Englishmen after he discovers that they enslaved his mother, but when the gentleman shows him the hanging of the white Vinculus, he weeps.<ref name=Hoiem/> Both Strange and Norrell see the essence of Englishness in the Raven King, a character who was raised by fairies and could not speak English. As Elizabeth Hoeim explains, "The most English of all Englishmen, then, is both king and slave, in many ways indistinguishable from Stephen Black. This paradox is what ultimately resolves the plot. When Strange and Norrell summon 'the nameless slave', the Raven King's powerful alliances with nature are transferred to Stephen Black, allowing Stephen to kill the Gentleman and free himself from slavery."<ref name=Hoiem/> In the end, it is Strange and Norrell who are trapped in everlasting darkness while the silenced women, people of colour, and poor whites defeat the [[antagonist]].<ref name=Hoiem/>

==Reception==
[[File:Gaiman, Neil (2007).jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Neil Gaiman]] has promoted Clarke's work since the beginning of her career, providing this blurb for ''Jonathan Strange & Mr Norrell'': "Unquestionably the finest English novel of the fantastic written in the last seventy years."<ref>Clarke, "Praise for ''Jonathan Strange & Mr Norrell''", ''Jonathan Strange & Mr Norrell''.</ref>]]

To promote ''Jonathan Strange & Mr Norrell'', Bloomsbury<U+2014>who also published the Harry Potter series<U+2014>launched what ''[[The Observer]]'' called "one of the biggest marketing campaigns in publishing history".<ref name=DSmith>David Smith, [http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2004/feb/22/books.booksnews "First time novelist weaves <U+00A3>1m magic: Historical tale billed as Harry Potter for adults set to be a world blockbuster"], ''[[The Observer]]'' (22 February 2004). Retrieved 12 January 2009.</ref> Their campaign included plans for newspaper serialisations, book deliveries by horse and carriage, and the placement of "themed teasers", such as period stationery and mock newspapers, in United States coffeeshops.<ref name=DSmith/> Seven thousand-five hundred advance readers<U+2019> copies were sent out, a limited number wrapped in paper and sealed with wax. These sold for more than US$100 each on [[eBay]] in England in the weeks leading up to publication.<ref name=Hodgman/> By 2005, collectors were paying hundreds of [[Pound sterling|pounds]] for signed copies of a limited edition of the novel.<ref>David Derbyshire, [http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1488986/Book-a-limited-edition-fortune.html "Book a fortune in advance &mdash; by buying limited editions"], ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' (1 May 2005). Retrieved 12 January 2009.</ref>

The book debuted at No.&nbsp;9 on the [[New York Times Best Seller list|''New York Times'' bestseller list]], rising to No.&nbsp;3 two weeks later.<ref name=Dawtrey/> Four weeks after the book's initial publication, it was in [[Amazon.com|Amazon's]] top ten.<ref name=WGrossman/> Clarke went on a 20-city tour to promote the novel, after its near-simultaneous publication in 20 countries.<ref name=FreemanInterview>John Freeman, "Author interview: Susanna Clarke", ''[[St. Petersburg Times]]'' (12 September 2004). [[LexisNexis]] (subscription required).

The novel met with "a crackle of favorable reviews in major papers".<ref name=LinskeySeptember>Annie Linskey, "Stranger than Fiction - After 10 years of writing, Susanna Clarke has found overnight success, and perhaps a bit of the old Potter magic, with her debut novel", ''[[The Baltimore Sun]]'' (29 September 2004). Access World News (subscription required). Retrieved 11 January 2009.</ref> ''[[The New Republic]]'' hailed it as "an exceptional work", both "thoughtful and irrepressibly imaginative".<ref name=Zimmerman/> The ''[[Houston Chronicle]]'' described Clarke as "a superb character writer",<ref name=FreemanChronicle>John Freeman, [http://www.chron.com/CDA/archives/archive.mpl?id=2004_3802830 "A fantasy that rings true - Susanna Clarke's new novel shows how fun reading can be"], ''[[Houston Chronicle]]'' (19 September 2004). Retrieved 12 January 2009.</ref> and the ''[[Denver Post]]'' called her a "superb storyteller".<ref name=Vidimos>Robin Vidimos, "Magic marries history Enchanting debut invokes Dickens", ''[[The Denver Post]]'' (5 September 2004). Access World News (subscription required). Retrieved 11 January 2009.</ref> The reviews praised Clarke's "deft" handling of the pastiche of styles, but many criticised the novel's pace, ''[[The Guardian]]'' complaining that "the plot creaks frightfully in many places and the pace dawdles".<ref name=Faber/> In his review for ''[[Science Fiction Weekly]]'', Clute suggested that "almost every scene in the first 300 pages should have been carefully and delicately ''trimmed''" (emphasis in original) since they do little to advance the story. He argued that, at times, Clarke's Austenesque tone gets in the way of plot development.<ref name=Clute/> On the other hand, ''[[The Baltimore Sun]]'' found the novel "a quick read".<ref name=LinskeyOctober/> Complaining that the book leaves the reader "longing for just a bit more lyricism and poetry", ''[[The Washington Post]]'' reviewer noted, with others, that "sex plays virtually no role in the story&nbsp;...&nbsp;[and] one looks in vain for the corruption of the innocent".<ref name=Dirda/> The ''[[New Statesman]]'' reviewer, [[Amanda Craig]], praised the novel as "a tale of magic such as might have been written by the young Jane Austen <U+2013> or, perhaps, by the young [[Ann Radcliffe|Mrs Radcliffe]], whose Gothic imagination and exuberant delicacy of style set the key." However, she also criticised the book: "As fantasy, it is deplorable, given that it fails to embrace the essentially anarchic nature of such tales. What is so wonderful about magicians, wizards and all witches other than [[Morgan le Fay]] is not just their magical powers, but that they possess these in spite of being low-born. Far from caring about being gentlemen, wizards are the ultimate expression of rank's irrelevance to talent".<ref name=Craig/> However, reviewers were not in universal agreement on any of these points. Maguire wrote in the ''[[New York Times]]'':

<blockquote>What keeps this densely realized confection aloft is that very quality of reverence to the writers of the past. The chief character in ''Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell'' isn't, in fact, either of the magicians: it's the library that they both adore, the books they consult and write and, in a sense, become. Clarke's giddiness comes from finding a way at once to enter the company of her literary heroes, to pay them homage and to add to the literature.<ref name=Maguire/></blockquote>

While promoting the novel, [[Neil Gaiman]] said that it was "unquestionably the finest English novel of the fantastic written in the last 70 years", a statement which has most often been read [[Hyperbole|hyperbolically]]. However, as Clute explains, what Gaiman meant was that ''Jonathan Strange'' is "the finest ''English'' novel of the fantastic since [[Hope Mirrlees|Hope Mirrlees's]] great ''[[Lud-in-the-Mist]]'' (1926), which is almost certainly the finest ''English'' fantasy about the relationship between England and the fantastic yet published" (emphasis in original).<ref name=Clute>John Clute, [http://www.scifi.com/sfw/issue385/excess.html "Excessive Candour: Please Open the Gate"], ''[[Science Fiction Weekly]]'' (7 September 2004). Retrieved 17 March 2009.</ref> Clute writes that "a more cautious claim" would be: "if Susanna Clarke finishes the story she has hardly begun in ''Strange''&nbsp;...&nbsp;she may well have then written the finest English novel of the fantastic about the myth of England and the myth of the fantastic and the marriage of the two ever published, bar none of the above, including Mirrlees."<ref name=Clute/>
