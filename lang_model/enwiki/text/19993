"'''A Streetcar Named Marge'''" is the second episode of ''[[The Simpsons]]''<nowiki>'</nowiki> [[The Simpsons (season 4)|fourth season]]. It first aired on the [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox network]] in the United States on [[October 1]], [[1992]]. In the episode, [[Marge Simpson|Marge]] wins the role of [[Blanche DuBois]] in a [[musical theatre|musical]] version of [[Tennessee Williams]]' ''[[A Streetcar Named Desire (play)|Streetcar Named Desire]]''. [[Homer Simpson|Homer]] is apathetic to his wife's acting pursuits, and Marge begins to see parallels between him and [[Stanley Kowalski]], the play's boorish lead male character. The episode contains a [[subplot]] in which [[Maggie Simpson]] attempts to retrieve her [[pacifier]] from a strict [[day care|daycare]] attendant. 

[[Jeff Martin]] wrote the episode, and [[Rich Moore]] served as director. [[Jon Lovitz]] made his fourth guest appearance on ''The Simpsons'', this time as musical director [[List of one-time characters from The Simpsons#Llewellyn .26 Ms. Sinclair|Llewellyn Sinclair]], as well as Llewellyn's sister, who runs the daycare. The episode generated controversy for its original song about [[New Orleans, Louisiana|New Orleans]], which contains several unflattering lyrics about the city. One New Orleans newspaper published the lyrics before the episode aired, prompting numerous complaints to the local Fox affiliate. In response, the president of Fox Broadcasting issued an apology to anyone who was offended. Despite the controversial song, the episode was well-received by many fans, and show creator [[Matt Groening]] has named it one of his favorite episodes. 
    
==Plot==
[[Image:MaggieAynRand.png|left|200px|thumb|Maggie after regaining the pacifiers]]
While Homer, [[Bart Simpson|Bart]] and [[Lisa Simpson|Lisa]] are watching television, Marge announces that she is going to audition for a local musical production of ''A Streetcar Named Desire''. She wants to meet new people, since she usually spends all day at home with Maggie. Homer reacts with disinterest and continues to watch the television. 

The musical is called "Oh, Streetcar!" and is directed by the acerbic Llewellyn Sinclair. After [[Ned Flanders]] is cast as Stanley Kowalski, Marge and several other women audition for Blanche DuBois. Llewellyn immediately rejects Marge and the others, explaining that Blanche is supposed to be a "delicate flower being trampled by an uncouth lout". However, as a dejected Marge calls home and takes Homer's dinner order, Llewellyn realizes that she is perfect for the role. He takes the telephone from Marge and shouts, "Stop bothering my Blanche!"

The next day, Maggie causes distractions when Marge brings her to rehearsal, so Llewellyn instructs Marge to enroll the baby at his sister's daycare center, the [[Ayn Rand]] School for Tots. Ms. Sinclair runs a strict daycare, and she immediately confiscates Maggie's pacifier. Maggie and the other babies later engage in a ''[[The Great Escape|Great Escape]]''-style attempt to retrieve their pacifiers, but Ms. Sinclair thwarts their efforts and sends Maggie to "The Box" (a playpen).  

During rehearsal, Marge struggles with a crucial scene in which Blanche is supposed to break a glass bottle and shove it in Stanley's face. She cannot muster enough hatred towards the Stanley character to break the bottle, and Llewellyn eventually leaves in disgust.  After coming home, Marge asks Homer to help her learn her lines, but Homer is more interested in his [[handheld video game|handheld]] [[bowling]] game. The day before the performance, Marge and Ned are again practicing the bottle scene as Homer arrives to drive Marge home. Homer repeatedly interrupts the rehearsal, then heads back to his car and honks for Marge to come out. Imagining that Stanley is Homer, Marge finally smashes the bottle and lunges at Ned. At dinner that night, Marge leaves early to practice with Flanders. Homer asks her to open his can of pudding, but Marge reacts with disdain and calls him a "big ape".

The next day at the Ayn Rand School for Tots, Maggie again attempts to regain the pacifiers and this time succeeds. Homer arrives to pick her up and discovers hundreds of babies sucking on pacifiers. He collects Maggie, and he and the children go to watch the musical. Homer immediately becomes bored, but he perks up when Marge appears on stage and becomes saddened over the way Stanley treats Blanche. At the end of the musical, Marge receives a warm reaction from the crowd, but she misinterprets Homer's sadness for boredom. Afterwards, Marge confronts Homer with hostility, but Homer explains that he was genuinely moved by Blanche's situation. Marge realizes that Homer really did watch the musical, and the two happily leave the theater.<ref name="officialsite"/><ref name="book">{{cite book|last=Richmond |first=Ray|coauthors=Antonia Coffman|title=[[The Simpsons: A Complete Guide to our Favorite Family]] |year=1997 |publisher=Harper Collins Publishers|id=ISBN 0-00063-8898-1|pages=p. 93}}</ref><ref name="bbc"/>

==Production==
"A Streetcar Named Marge" was conceived about two years before it aired on television.<ref name="Martin">{{cite video | people=Martin, Jeff|year=2004|title=The Simpsons season 4 DVD commentary for the episode "A Streetcar Named Marge"| medium=DVD||publisher=20th Century Fox}}</ref> Jeff Martin first pitched the idea of Homer being in a theatrical production of ''[[1776 (play)|1776]]''. Producer [[James L. Brooks]] then suggested that Marge could play Blanche DuBois in ''A Streetcar Named Desire''. Brooks saw that Marge's relationship with Homer was similar to Blanche's relationship with Stanley, and he wanted to use that fact to build the emotional arc for an episode. The estate of Tennessee Williams would not let the show use large excerpts from the actual play, since the work was copyrighted.<ref name="Martin"/> However, Fox lawyer Anatole Klebanow said that original songs based on the play were acceptable. According to producer [[Mike Reiss]], Klebanow even promised to "take [their] case to the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] to get [the] episode aired."<ref name="Reiss">{{cite video | people=Reiss, Mike|year=2004|title=The Simpsons season 4 DVD commentary for the episode "A Streetcar Named Marge"| medium=DVD||publisher=20th Century Fox}}</ref> Martin later explained that while the songs made the episode funnier, they also made it harder to write.<ref name="Martin"/> 
[[Image:Jonlovitz.jpg|right|175px|thumb|Jon Lovitz guest starred as Llewellyn Sinclair and Ms. Sinclair.]]
The Maggie subplot was present in Jeff Martin's episode pitch.<ref name="Jean">{{cite video | people=Jean, Al|year=2004|title=The Simpsons season 4 DVD commentary for the episode "A Streetcar Named Marge"| medium=DVD||publisher=20th Century Fox}}</ref> The music in the sequence is [[Elmer Bernstein]]'s [[march (music)|march]] theme from ''The Great Escape''. ''Simpsons'' composer [[Alf Clausen]] secured the rights to the score, along with the original orchestra charts. ''The Great Escape'' had been Martin's favorite film as child, and he said "it was so exciting and so stirring" to hear the music being performed by the ''Simpsons''<nowiki>'</nowiki> studio orchestra.<ref name="Martin"/> 

"A Streetcar Named Marge" posed a challenge to the show's [[animation director]]s. The episode contains many long [[setpiece]]s, especially during the final third, which includes the end of the Maggie subplot and the performance of the musical.<ref name="Martin"/> Several scenes required the animators to draw dozens of background characters.<ref name= "Groening"/> [[Rich Moore]], the head director, initially feared the episode would not be completed in time.<ref name="Jean"/> [[David Silverman]], the supervising director, also had doubts;<ref name="Jean"/> according to Jeff Martin, Silverman sent back a cartoon of himself reading the script with his eyes popping out and his jaw dropped.<ref name="Martin"/> Producer [[Al Jean]] said that Moore "worked himself to death" to produce the episode's most elaborate sequences.<ref name="Jean"/>

===Voice acting===
All of the main ''Simpsons'' [[List of cast members of The Simpsons#Regular Cast|cast members]] lent their voices to the episode, along with semi-regulars [[Maggie Roswell]] and [[Phil Hartman]]. Assistant producer [[Lona Williams]] also had a minor speaking role.<ref name="bbc"/> Comedian Jon Lovitz, who played Llewellyn Sinclair and Ms. Sinclar, made his fourth guest appearance on ''The Simpsons''.  He had previously voiced characters in "[[The Way We Was]]", "[[Brush with Greatness]]", and "[[Homer Defined]]". Lovitz later worked with Al Jean and Mike Reiss in the short-lived animated sitcom ''[[The Critic]]'', and returned to ''The Simpsons'' for the episodes "[[A Star Is Burns]]", "[[Hurricane Neddy]]", "[[The Ziff Who Came to Dinner]]", "[[Half-Decent Proposal]]", and "[[Homerazzi]]". In 2006, Lovitz was named the eighth best ''Simpsons'' guest star by [[IGN]].<ref>{{citeweb|url=http://tv.ign.com/articles/730/730566p4.html|title=Top 25 Simpsons Guest Appearances|accessdate=2007-03-25|author=Goldman, Eric; Iverson, Dan; Zoromski, Brian|publisher=[[IGN]]}}</ref>

== Cultural references ==
[[Image:Simpsons Hitchcock.png|left|200px|thumb|Alfred Hitchcock walking his dogs, a reference to his cameo in ''[[The Birds (film)|The Birds]]'']]
Though "Oh, Streetcar!" is based on ''A Streetcar Named Desire'', the title of the musical alludes to the theatrical revue ''[[Oh! Calcutta!]]'' Other characters from Williams' work who appear in the musical include Stella (played by [[Helen Lovejoy]]), Steve (played by [[Apu Nahasapeemapetilon|Apu]]), and Mitch (played by [[Lionel Hutz]]). The musical's closing song, "Kindness of Strangers", is a reference to Blanche's last line in the original play: "I have always depended on the kindness of strangers." However, the song is very cheery in tone, intentionally missing the point of Blanche's line, which is meant to be ironic. In the DVD commentary for the episode, Jeff Martin said the number would be more appropriate in ''[[Meet Me in St. Louis]]'' than in Williams' work.<ref name="Martin"/> 
 
The episode contains multiple references to [[Ayn Rand]]'s novels and [[Objectivism (Ayn Rand)|Objectivist philosophy]]. Maggie's daycare center is called "Ayn Rand's School for Tots", and  Ms. Sinclair can be seen reading a book called ''The Fountainhead Diet'', a reference to Rand's novel ''[[The Fountainhead]]''. On the wall of the daycare is a poster that reads "Helping is Futile", an allusion to Rand's rejection of the ethical doctrine of [[altruism (ethics)|altruism]]. Another wall sign reads "A is A," the [[law of identity]], which plays a central role in Rand's novel ''[[Atlas Shrugged]]''.<ref name="Turner">{{cite book| last = Turner| first = Chris| title =[[Planet Simpson: How a Cartoon Masterpiece Documented an Era and Defined a Generation]]| year= 2004| publisher = DeCapo Press| pages=pp. 64<U+2013>65| id = ISBN 0-679-31318-4}}</ref>

The Maggie subplot uses the musical score of ''[[The Great Escape]]'' and contains several other allusions to the film. At one point, Ms. Sinclair punishes Maggie by sending her to a playpen called "The Box", a play on "The Cooler" from the 1963 film. Maggie even bounces a ball against the wall of the playpen, as [[Steve McQueen]]'s character Virgil Hilts does throughout the film while he is in confinement.<ref name=bbc/> 

In the scene where Homer, Bart and Lisa pick up Maggie from the daycare center, babies are perched all over the building, staring at the family and quietly sucking on pacifiers. This is a spoof of a similar shot in [[Alfred Hitchcock]]'s ''[[The Birds (film)|The Birds]].'' Indeed, a cartoon-version of Hitchcock can be seen walking his dogs past the daycare, a reference to his own [[List of Hitchcock cameo appearances|cameo appearance]] in the film.<ref name="Reiss"/> The episode also contains a reference to ''[[Citizen Kane]]'', in which Homer plays with a shredded playbill while he watches his wife in the musical. This alludes to the opera scene from [[Orson Welles]]' movie.<ref name=bbc/>

In 1993, "A Streetcar Named Marge" and "[[Mr. Plow]]" were submitted for the [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Comedy Series]]. The ''Simpsons''<nowiki>'</nowiki> staff had previously submitted episodes for [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Animated Program (For Programming less than One Hour)|Outstanding Animated Program]], winning twice, but that season they took a chance with the main comedy category. However, the Emmy voters were hesitant to pit cartoons against live action programs, and ''The Simpsons'' did not receive a nomination. The ''Simpsons''<nowiki>'</nowiki> crew submitted episodes for Outstanding Comedy Series the next season, but these again were not nominated.<ref name="Jean">{{cite video | people=Jean, Al|year=2004|title=The Simpsons season 4 DVD commentary for the episode "[[Mr. Plow]]"| medium=DVD||publisher=20th Century Fox}}</ref> Since then, the show has submitted episodes in the animation category and has won seven times.<ref name="Emmy">[http://www.emmys.org/awards/awardsearch.php Emmy Awards official site] "The Simpsons" ''emmys.org''.

===Controversy===
[[Image:New Orleans Chalk Gag.png|right|200px|thumb|The chalkboard gag for "[[Homer the Heretic]]"]]
The musical within the episode contains a controversial song about New Orleans, which describes the city as a "home of pirates, drunks and whores", among other things. Jeff Martin, the writer of the episode, had meant the song to be a parody of the opening number in ''[[Sweeney Todd (musical)|Sweeney Todd]]'', which speaks of [[London]] in unflattering terms.<ref name="Martin2">{{cite video | people=Martin, Jeff|year=2004|title=The Simpsons season 4 DVD extra "The Cajun Controversy"| medium=DVD||publisher=20th Century Fox}}</ref> Al Jean later explained that two [[Cajun]] characters were supposed to walk out of the theater in disgust, but none of the voice actors could provide a convincing Cajun accent.<ref name=Lorando>Mark Lorando. "'Simpsons' takes a shot at Crescent City." ''[[The Times-Picayune]]''. [[1992-10-01]]. p. A1.</ref>

Before the premiere of the fourth season, the producers sent two episodes to critics: "[[Kamp Krusty]]" and "A Streetcar Named Marge".<ref name="Jean"/> A New Orleans critic viewed "A Streetcar Named Marge" and published the song lyrics in his newspaper before the episode aired.<ref name=Lorando/> Many readers took the lyrics out of context, and New Orleans' Fox affiliate, [[WNOL]], received about one hundred complaints on the day the episode aired. Several local radio stations also held on-air protests in response to the song.<ref>Mark Lorando. "Fox apologizes for 'Simpsons'. ''[[The Times-Picayune]]''. [[1992-10-02]]. p. B1.</ref>  

At the urging of WNOL, Fox president [[Jamie Kellner]] released a statement on [[October 1]], [[1992]] apologizing for the episode:

{{cquote|It has come to our attention that a comedic song about New Orleans in tonight's episode of "The Simpsons" has offended some city residents and officials. Viewers who watch the episode will realize that the song is in fact a parody of the opening numbers of countless Broadway musicals, which are designed to set the stage for the story that follows. That is the only purpose of this song. We regret that the song, taken out of context, has caused offence. This was certainly not the intention of "The Simpsons" production staff or Fox Broadcasting Company.<ref name="CC">{{cite video |year=2004|title=The Simpsons season 4 DVD extra "The Cajun Controversy"| medium=DVD||publisher=20th Century Fox}}</ref>}}

The ''Simpsons''<nowiki>'</nowiki> producers rushed out a [[chalkboard gag]] for "[[Homer the Heretic]]", which aired a week after "A Streetcar Named Marge". It read, "I will not defame New Orleans." The gag was their attempt to "apologize" for the song and hopefully bring the controversy to an end.<ref name="Martin2"/>  "We didn't realize people would get so mad," said Al Jean. "It was the best apology we could come up with in eight words or less."<ref> Mark Lorando. "Bart chalks up apology for New Orleans song." ''[[The Times-Picayune]]''. [[1992-10-08]]. p. A1.</ref> The issue passed quickly, and a person in a Bart Simpson costume even served as [[Krewe of Tucks]] Grand Marshal at the 1993 [[New Orleans Mardi Gras]].<ref>"For Silver Celebration, Tucks 'Lov-A-Da Music." ''[[The Times-Picayune]]''. [[1993-02-21]]. p. D7. [[1993-02-21]].</ref>

The episode generated further controversy in September 2005, when [[Channel 4]] in the [[United Kingdom]] decided to air the episode a week after [[Hurricane Katrina]] struck New Orleans. Arguing that the episode was an insensitive choice, given recent events, several viewers filed complaints with [[Ofcom]]. Two days later, Channel 4 apologized on-air and directly contacted all those who had complained. Channel 4 had screened the episode for offensive content, but the reviews focused on the main content of the episode, and the song was not considered a key part of the plot. Channel 4 promised to update their review process to ensure that similar incidents would not occur.<ref name="Ofcom">{{cite web|url=http://www.ofcom.org.uk/tv/obb/prog_cb/pcb49/#skip|title=Issue number 46|accessdate=2007-08-24|date=2005|publisher=Ofcom}}</ref>
