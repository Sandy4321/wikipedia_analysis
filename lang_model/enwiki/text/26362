==Gameplay==
===Basics===
[[Image:Thracia776Screencap.png|thumb|right|Gameplay map screen from ''Fire Emblem: Thracia 776'']]
The ''Fire Emblem'' series of [[turn-based tactics]] games centers around moving units through a map grid in order to defeat the opposition. Players use strategic movements and positioning to complete mission objectives such as seizing a base,<ref name="Eurogamer gameplay details">{{cite news|title='Fire Emblem for Game Boy Advance Review &mdash; Eurogamer'|url=http://www.eurogamer.net/article.php?article_id=55981|accessdate=2007-07-10|date=2004-07-07|work=[http://www.eurogamer.net/index.php Eurogamer]|author=Tom Bramwell}}</ref> surviving for a number of turns, or defeating a [[Boss (video games)|boss]]. Many conventions of traditional [[console role-playing game]]s are also present; for example, there is extensive use of scripted [[cutscene]]s to advance the story, units gain [[experience point]]s and grow stronger over the course of the campaign, and the player can visit shops to outfit characters with weapons and equipment.<ref name="IGN gameplay details">{{cite news|title='Fire Emblem for Game Boy Advance Review &mdash; IGN'|url=http://uk.gameboy.ign.com/articles/458/458227p1.html|accessdate=2007-07-10|date=2003-11-05|work=[http://uk.ign.com/ IGN]|author=Craig Harris}}</ref>
Depending on the game, these events may take place during or in-between battles.

The combat system bases itself on a [[Rock, Paper, Scissors|rock-paper-scissors]] method of fighting,<ref name="Gameplay details">{{cite news|title='Fire Emblem for Game Boy Advance Review'|url=http://uk.gamespot.com/gba/rpg/fireemblem/review.html|accessdate=2007-07-09|date=2003-11-11|work=[http://uk.gamespot.com/gba/index.html?tag=header;logo Gamespot]|author=Bethany Massimilla}}</ref> as each weapon type has both an advantage and a disadvantage against other types. From ''[[Fire Emblem: Seisen no Keifu]]'' to the most recent game, ''[[Fire Emblem: Radiant Dawn]]'', the weapon triangle has been [[lance]] beats [[sword]], sword beats [[axe]], and axe beats lance.<ref name="Fire Emblem: Genealogy of the Holy War summary">{{cite news|title='Fire Emblem: Seisen no Keifu'|url=http://uk.cheats.ign.com/objects/010/010711.html|accessdate=2007-07-10|date|work=[http://uk.ign.com/ IGN]|author}}</ref> [[Bow (weapon)|Bows]] are unaffected by the triangle, can attack from a distance, and do higher amounts of damage against flying units like [[Pegasus|pegasi]],<ref name="Gameplay details">{{cite news|title='Fire Emblem for Game Boy Advance Review'|url=http://uk.gamespot.com/gba/rpg/fireemblem/review.html|accessdate=2007-07-09|date=2003-11-11|work=[http://uk.gamespot.com/gba/index.html?tag=header;logo Gamespot]|author=Bethany Massimilla}}</ref> but this is offset by the bow-wielder's inability to counter-attack direct melee strikes. A similar trinity of magic, that varies from game to game, has also existed. In the Game Boy Advance ''Fire Emblem'' games, light beats dark, dark beats anima, and anima beats light.<ref name="Magic triangle">{{cite news|title='Fire Emblem &mdash; Weapons'|url=http://www.rpgclassics.com/shrines/gba/fe7/weapon.shtml|accessdate=2007-07-10|date|work=[http://www.rpgclassics.com/ RPG Classics]|author}}</ref> In other games, fire beats wind, wind beats thunder, and thunder beats fire. Magic is also unique in that magical attacks can be used from either a distance or in melee range.

Unlike in most other games, most weapons in the ''Fire Emblem'' series have a finite number of uses and will eventually break. Therefore, the player must often buy replacement weapons or spend gold to have broken weapons repaired.<ref name="Eurogamer gameplay details">{{cite news|title='Fire Emblem for Game Boy Advance Review &mdash; Eurogamer'|url=http://www.eurogamer.net/article.php?article_id=55981|accessdate=2007-07-10|date=2004-07-07|work=[http://www.eurogamer.net/index.php Eurogamer]|author=Tom Bramwell}}</ref> Typically, weaker weapons allow more uses than more powerful ones.

===Units===
Unlike in ''[[Advance Wars]]'' and other tactical RPGs such as ''[[Final Fantasy Tactics]]'', player-generated units are absent. Instead, ''Fire Emblem'' utilizes a distinct cast of characters, each belonging to one of many [[character class]]es and having a personality and past of his or her own.<ref name="Gameplay details">{{cite news|title='Fire Emblem for Game Boy Advance Review'|url=http://uk.gamespot.com/gba/rpg/fireemblem/review.html|accessdate=2007-07-09|date=2003-11-11|work=[http://uk.gamespot.com/gba/index.html?tag=header;logo Gamespot]|author=Bethany Massimilla}}</ref> Typically, the size of the player's character roster is very small at the beginning of each game, but as progress is made, other units may join the player's party through story events or through actions taken. The latter games in the series typically contain playable rosters between thirty and seventy characters deep.<ref name="List of characters in Fire Emblem: Blazing Sword">{{cite news|title='Fire Emblem &mdash; Support Conversation'|url=http://www.rpgclassics.com/shrines/gba/fe7/support.shtml|accessdate=2007-07-13|date|work=The Great games Experiment|author}}</ref>

Using units in battle will allow them to gain [[experience point]]s; a character's level will increase upon gaining one hundred experience points. Leveling up party members can be a challenge, as many newly recruited units arrive with inferior levels and statistics,<ref name="Experience point management">{{cite news|title='Fire Emblem: Path of Radiance &mdash; Chapter 19'|url=http://www.thegamechair.com/?p=287|accessdate=2007-07-13|date|work=[http://www.thegamechair.com/ The Game Chair]|author="Scott" at The Game Chair}}</ref> but because the amount of experience earned from defeating an enemy is determined by the level discrepancy between the battling units, characters at lower levels earn more experience than higher-leveled characters when defeating enemies of comparable level. In addition to statistics, units have a weapon level for each type of weapon they can use; these run from E (lowest) to S (highest). In ''Radiant Dawn'' it is possible to achieve an SS weapon level, which is one level higher than S.<ref name="SS Rank in RD">{{cite news|title='Fire Emblem: Radiant Dawn on Great Games Experiment'|url=http://www.greatgamesexperiment.com/game/FireEmblemRadiantDawn|accessdate=2007-12-31|date|work=The Great Games Experiment|author}}</ref> Units can only use weapons whose level is equal to or lower than their own, but weapon levels can be increased by repeatedly using weapons of that type.

As characters level up, they may gain the ability to change to a more powerful character class, often referred to as "promotion." Depending on the mechanics of the particular game, characters may promote upon reaching a certain level,<ref name="Gameplay details">{{cite news|title='Fire Emblem for Game Boy Advance Review'|url=http://uk.gamespot.com/gba/rpg/fireemblem/review.html|accessdate=2007-07-09|date=2003-11-11|work=[http://uk.gamespot.com/gba/index.html?tag=header;logo Gamespot]|author=Bethany Massimilla}}</ref> or through the use of special items that instantly cause promotion. Major characters may automatically promote during story events. Characters that promote receive a one-time [[statistics]] upgrade that is higher than the average leveling upgrade and additional abilities that are standards of the higher-tier classes.

===Supports===
[[Romance (love)|Romance]] and friendship are prevalent themes throughout the ''Fire Emblem'' series. Starting from the sixth game, ''F<U+016B>in no Tsurugi'',<ref name="When supports started">{{cite news|title='A History of Fire Emblem: Sword of Seals'|url=http://www.derekmiller.us/fireemblem/part7.html|date=January 2004|accessdate=2007-07-14|work=[http://www.derekmiller.us/fireemblem/index.html A History of Fire Emblem]|author=Derek Miller}}</ref> this characteristic has been further emphasized in the gameplay itself through the use of support conversations. In the GBA ''Fire Emblem'' titles, these conversations can be triggered by having specific pairs of characters end their turns standing next to each other. After a specific number of turns have accumulated, the player is given the option to view a support conversation between the two characters; this process can occur up to three times.<ref name="List of characters in Fire Emblem: Blazing Sword">{{cite news|title='Fire Emblem &mdash; Support Conversation'|url=http://www.rpgclassics.com/shrines/gba/fe7/support.shtml|accessdate=2007-07-13|date|work=[http://www.rpgclassics.com/ RPG Classics]|author}}</ref> ''Path of Radiance'' altered the approach by requiring characters to be in a certain number of battles together and not necessarily adjacent to one another.<ref name="Path of Radiance supports">{{cite news|title='RPGFan Reviews &mdash; Path of Radiance'|url=http://www.rpgfan.com/reviews/fireemblem-por/index.html|accessdate=2006-01-02|date|work=[http://www.rpgfan.com/index.html RPG Fan]|author=Mark P. Tjan}}</ref> ''Radiant Dawn'' changed the system further, allowing multiple means of accumulating support between characters; in addition, supports can occur between any two playable characters, but can also be removed.

Characters who support each other receive statistical bonuses, based on support level and each character's elemental affinity, that activate any time they are within three spaces of each other on the battlefield.<ref name="List of characters in Fire Emblem: Blazing Sword">{{cite news|title='Fire Emblem &mdash; Support Conversation'|url=http://www.rpgclassics.com/shrines/gba/fe7/support.shtml|accessdate=2007-07-13|date|work=[http://www.rpgclassics.com/ RPG Classics]|author}}</ref> If two characters with a mutual romantic attraction, strong friendship, or other form of mutual connection engage in three support conversations throughout the game, the result will sometimes affect the game's ending.<ref name="Alternative endings">{{cite news|title='Fire Emblem for Game Boy Advance cheats'|url=http://uk.gamespot.com/gba/strategy/fireemblem/hints.html?om_act=convert&om_clk=tabs&tag=tabs;cheats|accessdate=2007-07-14|date|work=[http://uk.gamespot.com/gba/index.html?tag=header;logo Gamespot]|author}}</ref> Depending on the characters involved, such results could include marriage, a deepening of friendship, a continued pursuit of their ongoing relationship, or in some cases a bittersweet parting.

===Death===
''Fire Emblem'' characters that run out of hit points and die cannot be brought back to life in the game.<ref name="Gameplay details">{{cite news|title='Fire Emblem for Game Boy Advance Review'|url=http://uk.gamespot.com/gba/rpg/fireemblem/review.html|accessdate=2007-07-09|date=2003-11-11|work=[http://uk.gamespot.com/gba/index.html?tag=header;logo Gamespot]|author=Bethany Massimilla}}</ref> This also affects recruitable NPC and enemy units. If a player wishes to continue using a character or to recruit a would-be playable unit that has been killed, then the player must restart that chapter from the beginning. In addition, a "Game Over" occurs whenever one of the main characters falls, or in other situations depending on a mission's requirements. Only under special circumstances, such as being significantly related to the story, will characters who have fallen in battle not actually die, though the player will still be unable to use them in further battles.<ref name="IGN gameplay details">{{cite news|title='Fire Emblem for Game Boy Advance Review &mdash; IGN'|url=http://uk.gameboy.ign.com/articles/458/458227p1.html|accessdate=2007-07-10|date=2003-11-05|work=[http://uk.ign.com/ IGN]|author=Craig Harris}}</ref> In extremely rare situations, characters that fall in battle can become playable at a later point in the game. For example, in ''Fire Emblem'', the game is split into two parts, [[List of characters in Fire Emblem (video game)#Lyn|Lyn]]'s tale and [[List of characters in Fire Emblem (video game)#Eliwood|Eliwood]]'s (or [[List of characters in Fire Emblem (video game)#Hector|Hector]]'s) tale; all characters from Lyn's tale are recruited again in the second part of the game, whether or not they survived the first part.

==Setting==
The primary settings of the ''Fire Emblem'' series are commonly defined by the names of the continents on which the games are set. Aside from Akaneia and Barensia, which are confirmed to be part of the same world, each continent is thought to exist in its own separate universe with its own incarnation of the Fire Emblem. Games set on the same continent are typically linked through the overarching storyline and character relationships. For example, ''Fire Emblem'' is a prequel to ''F<U+016B>in no Tsurugi'',<ref name="The Fire Emblem relationship">{{cite news|title='A History of Fire Emblem: Blazing Sword'|url=http://www.derekmiller.us/fireemblem/part8.html|date=January 2004|accessdate=2007-07-14|work=[http://www.derekmiller.us/fireemblem/index.html A History of Fire Emblem]|author=Derek Miller}}</ref> and some of the characters in these games are blood-related. There are currently six continents:

The eponymous item of the games is a plot device or item that has taken multiple forms throughout the series, changing with the setting. The original Fire Emblem was a [[shield]]. In the remake of the original game in ''Monsh<U+014D> no Nazo'', the Fire Emblem can open chests, and in the second half of the game, it can be upgraded with five orbs to turn it into the Shield of Seals.<ref name="The Fire Emblem upgrade">{{cite news|title='A History of Fire Emblem: Mystery of the Emblem'|url=http://www.derekmiller.us/fireemblem/part4.html|date=January 2004|accessdate=2007-07-14|work=[http://www.derekmiller.us/fireemblem/index.html A History of Fire Emblem]|author=Derek Miller}}</ref> In ''Seisen no Keifu'', it does not appear, but it is mentioned as the family [[Crest (heraldry)|crest]] of a noble house by the person succeeding it.<ref name="The Fire Emblems">{{cite news|title='The Fire Emblem summaries'|url=http://serenesforest.net/general/emblem.html|accessdate=2007-07-17|work=[http://serenesforest.net/general/ Serenes Forest]|author=}}</ref> In ''F<U+016B>in no Tsurugi'' and ''Fire Emblem'', the Fire Emblem is a gemstone required for a ceremony to recognize the heir to a kingdom, and also to seal away a dragon. In ''The Sacred Stones'', the Fire Emblem is one of the titular stones, which holds the spirit of a demon. In ''Path of Radiance'' and ''Radiant Dawn'', it is a medallion containing the imprisoned spirit of a deity.

==Games==
The following is a list of games released in the series. 

:Games predating ''[[Fire Emblem (video game)|Fire Emblem]]'' were released only in Japan. As a result, there are no official English language titles for these games, except ''Fire Emblem: Shadow Dragons and the Blade of Light'', ''Fire Emblem Gaiden'' and ''Fire Emblem: The Binding Blade''. These names are used in the sound test for ''Super Smash Bros. Brawl'' for the Nintendo Wii.

A ''Fire Emblem'' game was originally planned for release on the [[Nintendo 64]],<ref name="[[Miyamoto]] Interview &ndash; reveals [[Fire Emblem]] 64">{{cite news|title= Miyamoto Reveals Secrets: Fire Emblem and Mario Paint 64|url=http://uk.ign64.ign.com/articles/061/061138p1.html|accessdate=2007-05-28||work= [[IGN]]}}</ref> but the project was discontinued.

==Controversy==
Controversy began  in 2001 when Shouzou Kaga, one of the series' main developers, left Nintendo to found Tirnanog, an independent studio. One of his first games was ''[[Tear Ring Saga]]'' for the [[PlayStation]], a game that borrowed heavily from the ''Fire Emblem'' series in terms of graphics and gameplay.<ref name="Frauds">{{cite news|title=Hardcore gaming 101: Fire Emblem|url=http://hg101.classicgaming.gamespy.com/fireemblem/fireemblem4.htm|accessdate=2007-10-14||work=http://hg101.classicgaming.gamespy.com/index.html Hardcore Gaming 101}}</ref> The game was initially similar to ''Fire Emblem'' in title, with the development name being ''Emblem Saga''. Nintendo filed a lawsuit against Tirnanog and the game's distributor Enterbrain seeking [[USD|$]]2 million in the belief that the game infringed upon Nintendo's copyright.<ref name="Law Suit">{{cite news|title=Nintendo sues over Emblem copyright|url=http://uk.cube.ign.com/articles/096/096891p1.html|accessdate=2007-10-14|work=[http://uk.ign.com/ IGN]}}</ref> Nintendo lost,<ref name="Frauds">{{cite news|title=Hardcore gaming 101: Fire Emblem|url=http://hg101.classicgaming.gamespy.com/fireemblem/fireemblem4.htm|accessdate=2007-10-14||work=http://hg101.classicgaming.gamespy.com/index.html Hardcore Gaming 101}}</ref> and Tirnanog later produced a sequel called ''Tear Ring Saga: Berwick Saga''.

==Music==
The musical scores for ''Fire Emblem'' have been composed by [[Yuka Tsujiyoko]] for most of the series' history.<ref name="Fire Emblem composer">{{cite news|title='Artist: Yuki Tsujiyoko'|url=http://musicbrainz.org/artist/982e4296-0060-4997-b734-4f42d3a74ff2.html|accessdate=2007-07-14||work=[http://musicbrainz.org/ MusicBrainz]}}</ref> The first eight games in the series all featured soundtracks composed entirely of instrumental music. However, ''[[Fire Emblem: Path of Radiance]]'' broke from this trend with the end credit theme "Life Returns", a lyrical piece sung in the language of the fictional heron laguz (bestial humanoids) tribe. A lyrical version of the "Fire Emblem Main Theme", previously used in older advertisements, is also in ''[[Super Smash Bros. Brawl]]''. Due to the worldwide release of the game, this version of the song is sung in Latin.<ref name="SSBB FE music">{{cite news|title='Smash Bros. DOJO!!'|url=http://www.smashbros.com/en_us/music/music13.html|accessdate=2007-11-05||work=[http://www.smashbros.com/en_us/index.html The Official Super Smash Bros. Brawl Website]}}</ref> 

There are also recurring tracks in the ''Fire Emblem'' series. The most frequently used is the "Fire Emblem Main Theme" which is played at some point during each game. Its use is particularly varied, as it is sometimes used as the title screen theme, while in ''Path of Radiance'', the song is not heard until the very end of the game, when each character's performance is ranked. Since ''[[Fire Emblem: Seisen no Keifu]]'', battle themes of previous Fire Emblem games have been remixed as arena battle themes.  Similar rearranging appears in other circumstances, as well; for example, the musical score for the trial maps in ''Path of Radiance'' was originally the music score for Chapter 10 of ''Seisen no Keifu''. The games' music has been released on various soundtracks in Japan.<ref name="Fire Emblem Soundtrack">{{cite news|title='Fire Emblem: The Sealed Sword Original Soundtrack'|url=http://www.chudahs-corner.com/soundtracks/index.php?catalog=TOCT-24827|accessdate=2007-05-31||work=[http://www.chudahs-corner.com/ Chuda's Corner]}}</ref>

====Card game====
The ''Fire Emblem'' trading card game was released by ''NTT Publishing Co., Ltd.'' in August 2001. Six series were produced before its termination in 2006. The first three series depicted characters from ''Seisen no Keifu'', the fourth featured characters from ''Thracia 776'', and the Anthology expansion featured characters from both games, but with artwork from different artists. The final two expansions featured characters from ''Monsh<U+014D> no Nazo''. The trading card game is similar to battles in ''Fire Emblem'', but players battle with different types of cards, such as character, terrain, weapon and surprise cards. ''NTT Publishing'' also published ''Fire Emblem'' soundtracks and books.<ref name="The Fire Emblem card games">{{cite news|title='The Fire Emblem : TCG'|url=http://serenesforest.net/media/fetcg.htm|accessdate=2007-07-17|work=[http://serenesforest.net/ Serenes Forest]|author=}}</ref>

====Appearance in other games====
[[Image:FireEmblemBrawl.jpg|thumb|[[Marth (Fire Emblem)|Marth]] (left) and [[Ike (Fire Emblem)|Ike]] in ''[[Super Smash Bros. Brawl]]'']]
Since its inception in 1990, the ''Fire Emblem'' series had largely been confined to Japan. In 2001, however, Nintendo released ''[[Super Smash Bros. Melee]]'', a fighting game containing characters from throughout the company's videogaming history. The original Japanese release of this game contained two characters from the ''Fire Emblem'' series: Marth, the protagonist of the first game, ''Fire Emblem: Ankoku no Ry<U+016B> to Hikari no Ken'', and the third, ''Fire Emblem: Monsh<U+014D> no Nazo''; and Roy,<ref name="SSBM FE characters">{{cite news|title='Roy'|url=http://www.smashbrosmelee.com/~characters/roy.shtml|accessdate=2007-07-14|date=|work=[http://www.smashbrosmelee.com/index.shtml Smash World]}}</ref> who stars in the then-unreleased sixth game, ''Fire Emblem: F<U+016B>in no Tsurugi''. According to Nintendo's official Japanese website, [[Marth (Fire Emblem)|Marth]] was put in ''Super Smash Bros. Melee'' upon the request of Japanese gamers. If Marth is unlocked, players can change the music of the Temple stage to a remixed version of the "Fire Emblem Main Theme" and ''Ankoku Ry<U+016B> to Hikari no Ken'''s "Encounter Theme".<ref name="Unlockable music">{{cite news|title='Hardcore Gaming 101: Fire Emblem'|url=http://hg101.classicgaming.gamespy.com/fireemblem/fireemblem.htm|accessdate=2007-12-16|date=|work=Hardcore Gaming 101}}</ref>

Marth's design and playability earned him extra attention while the game underwent debug testing in North America, and it was by the decision of Nintendo of America that he was included in the North American version. Roy had been included in Japan to promote the upcoming release of ''F<U+016B>in no Tsurugi'', and was likewise included in the North American version. It was due in part to Marth and Roy's popularity from their appearance in ''Super Smash Bros. Melee'' that Nintendo eventually decided to localize and market ''Fire Emblem'' games for North American and European release.<ref name="Fire Emblem Details">{{cite news|title='Fire Emblem Database'|url=http://nindb.classicgaming.gamespy.com/agb-ae7.shtml|accessdate=2007-07-07|date|work=[http://nindb.classicgaming.gamespy.com/index.html Nintendo Database]}}</ref>
