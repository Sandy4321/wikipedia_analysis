==Early life and background==
Kothari was an only son of his father, a Jain trader. His mother died early in life.<ref name=tri/>

==Career==
Kothari started his career as a lecturer at [[Maharaja Sayajirao University of Baroda]] (Baroda University), while working here he first received recognition in 1961, when his essays series, "Form and Substance in Indian Politics" were published in ''[[Economic and Political Weekly]]'' (then ''Economic Weekly'') over six issues. He had also started writing for ''Seminar'', the journal published by [[Romesh Thapar]]. Thereafter he was invited by Professor Shyama Charan Dubey to become the Assistant Director of the National Institute of Community Development, Mussoorie. In 1963, he moved to Delhi, where using a personal grant of Rs. 70,000 given by Professor Richard L. Park, head of [[Asia Foundation]]<U+2019>s India chapter, he started Centre for the Study of Developing Societies (CSDS),  in the premises of the Indian Adult Education Association at Indraprastha Estate, Delhi, before moving to its present location in [[Civil Lines, Delhi]]. Here working along with [[Ashis Nandy]], D.L. Sheth, Ramashray Roy, Bashiruddin Ahmed and others, pioneering works in social sciences were published over next two decades.  In 1970 he published  ''Politics in India'', which first theorized [[Indian National Congress]] as a [[system]] rather than a party. Thereafter he published noted works like  ''Caste in Indian Politics'' (1973) and ''Footsteps into the Future'' (1975).<ref name=today>{{cite web| title = Book review: 'Memoirs' by Rajni Kothari : Books|publisher=India Today|author=Harsh Sethi| url = http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/book-review-memoirs-by-rajni-kothari/1/219538.html| date=June 3, 2002|accessdate = 2014-01-13 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | title = Interview Rajni Kothari, The Centre and Indian reality | url = http://www.india-seminar.com/2012/639/639_interview_kothari.htm |publisher=India-seminar|year=2012|accessdate=January 13, 2014}}</ref><ref name=Rajni/>

During the early 1970s, he associated with Congress-leader Indira Gandhi, and negotiated with the Congress-led Central government for [[Navnirman movement]], a socio-political movement of 1974 against corruption in Gujarat, which ultimately led to the dissolution of the state government. However, with the entry of Sanjay Gandhi, he distanced himself from Congress, and came close to [[Jaya Prakash Narayan]] and the [[Janata Party]] instead. After the [[Emergency (India)|Emergency of 1975]], he moved away from political parties, and started his career as an activist. This phase culminated with the foundation of ''Lokayan'' - Dialogue of the People in 1980, a forum for interaction between activists, thinkers and intellectuals to talked about positive changes in the fields of  religion, agriculture, health, politics, and education.<ref name=today/>

Soon, he became associated with "Citizens for Democracy", and [[People's Union for Civil Liberties]] (PUCL) : a human rights body, established in 1976, where he remained General Secretary from 1982 to 1984, and subsequently its President.<ref>{{cite web | title = PUCL National Council office bearers: Former Presidents| url = http://www.pucl.org/admin/national_council.html|publisher=People's Union for Civil Liberties (PUCL) | accessdate = 2014-01-13}}</ref> He served as the chairman of Indian Council of Social Science Research (ICSSR) and also remained member of the [[Planning Commission (India)|Planning Commission]].<ref name=today/>
