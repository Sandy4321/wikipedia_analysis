The '''Valley of the Kings''' ('''Wadi Biban el-Muluk''' (<U+0648><U+0627><U+062F><U+064A> <U+0627><U+0644><U+0645><U+0644><U+0648><U+0643>) in [[Arabic language|Arabic]])<ref>Reeves and Wilkinson (1996), p. 6</ref> is a [[valley]] in [[Egypt]] where [[tomb]]s were built for the [[Pharaoh]]s and powerful nobles of the [[Conventional Egyptian chronology#New Kingdom|New Kingdom]], the [[Eighteenth dynasty of Egypt|Eighteenth]] through [[Twentieth dynasty of Egypt|Twentieth Dynasties]] of [[Ancient Egypt]].<ref>Maspero (1913), p. 182</ref><ref>{{cite web | title = Theban Mapping Project  | url=http://www.thebanmappingproject.com | accessdate = 2006-12-04 }}</ref>
The valley stands on the west bank of the [[Nile]], across from [[Thebes, Egypt|Thebes]] (modern [[Luxor]]), within the heart of the [[Theban Necropolis]].<ref name="silottip13">Siliotti (1997), p.13</ref> The wadi consists of two valleys, [[#East Valley|East]] and [[#West Valley|West]], with the majority of the royal tombs situated in the East Valley. 

The area has been a focus of concentrated [[Archaeology|archaeological]] and [[Egyptology|egyptological]] exploration since the end of the [[eighteenth century]], and its tombs and burials continue to stimulate research and interest. In modern times the valley has become famous for the discovery of the [[KV62|tomb]] of [[Tutankhamun]] (with its rumours of the [[Curse of the Pharaohs]]<ref>{{cite web | url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2005/05/0510_050506_tvcurse.html | title = Egypt's "King Tut Curse" Caused by Tomb Toxins? | work = National Geographic | accessdate = 2006-12-08}}</ref>), and is one of the most famous archaeological sites in the world. In 1979, along with the rest of the Theban Necropolis, it became a [[World Heritage Site]].<ref>

==Geology==
[[Image:Startigraphy of the Valley of the Kings.png|right|thumb|256px|Stratigraphy of the Valley]]
The Theban hills in which the valley is located are an alternating sandwich of dense [[limestone]] and other sedimentary rock (which form the cliffs in the valley and the nearby [[Deir el-Bahri]]) and soft layers of [[marl]]. The sedimentary rock was originally deposited between 35 - 56 million years ago during a time when the precursor to the [[Mediterranean Sea]] covered an area that extended much further inland than today. During the [[Pleistocene]] the valley was carved out the plateau by steady rains.<ref name="ThebanMapGeology">
{{cite web | title = Geography and Geology of the Valley | work = Theban Mapping Project | url=http://www.thebanmappingproject.com/articles/article_1.html | accessdate = 2006-12-04 }}</ref> There is currently little year-round rain in this part of Egypt, but there are occasional [[flash flood]]s which hit the valley, dumping tons of debris into the open tombs.<ref>Sampsell (2003), p. 78</ref> 

The quality of the rock in the Valley is inconsistent, ranging from finely-grained to coarse stone, the latter with the potential to be structurally unsound. The occasional layer of [[shale]] also caused construction and conservation difficulties, as this rock expands in the presence of water, forcing apart the stone surrounding it. It is thought that some tombs were altered in shape and size depending on the types of the layers of rock the builders encountered.<ref name="ThebanMapGeology" />

Builders took advantage of available geological features when constructing the tombs. Some tombs were quarried out of existing limestone clefts, others behind slopes of [[scree]], or were at the edge of rock spurs created by ancient flood channels.<ref name="ThebanMapGeology" />

The problems of tomb construction can be seen with tombs of [[Ramesses III]] and his father [[Setnakhte]]. Setnakhte started to excavate [[KV11]], but broke into the tomb of [[Amenmesse]], so construction was abandoned and he instead usurped the tomb of [[Twosret]], [[KV14]]. When looking for a tomb, Ramesses III extended the part-excavated tomb started by his father.<ref>Weigall (1910), p. 194</ref> The tomb of Ramesses II returned to an early style, probably due to the quality of the rock being excavated.

Between 1998-2002 the [[Amarna Royal Tombs Project]] investigated the valley floor using [[ground-penetrating radar]] and found that below the modern surface the Valley's cliffs descend beneath the scree in a series of abrupt, natural "shelves", arranged one below the other, descending several metres down to the bedrock in the valley floor.<ref>{{cite web | title = Amarna Royal Tombs Project | url=http://www.valleyofthekings.org/vofk/default.htm | accessdate = 2006-12-04 }}</ref>

==History==
The Theban Hills are dominated by the peak of al-Qurn, known to the Ancient Egyptians as '''ta dehent''', or 'The Peak'. It has a pyramid shaped appearance, and it is considered to have been the reason why the kings of Egypt started to be buried beneath it, echoing the pyamids of the [[Old Kingdom of Egypt|Old Kingdom]], more than a thousand years prior to the first royal burials carved out in the Valley of the Kings.<ref>Dodson (1991), pp. 5-7</ref><ref>Reeves and Wilkinson (1996), p. 17</ref> Its isolated position also resulted in reduced access, and special tomb police (the [[Medjay]]) were able to guard the necropolis.

While the iconic pyramid complexes of the [[Giza pyramid complex|Giza plateau]] have come to symbolize ancient Egypt, the majority of tombs were in fact cut into rock. Most pyramids and [[mastabas]] contain sections which are cut into ground level, and there are full rock-cut tombs in Egypt that date back to the Old Kingdom.

After the defeat of the [[Hyksos]] and the reunification of Egypt under [[Ahmose I]], the [[Eighteenth Dynasty of Egypt|Theban rulers]] began to construct elaborate tombs that would reflect their new found power.<ref>Baines and Malik (2000), p. 99</ref> The tombs of Ahmose and his son [[Amenhotep I]] were probably (their exact location remains unknown) in the [[Seventeenth dynasty of Egypt|Seventeenth Dynasty]] necropolis of [[Dra' Abu el-Naga']].<ref>Strudwick & Strudwick (1999) p.94</ref> The first royal tomb in the valley were those of [[Amenhotep I]] (although this identification is also disputed),<ref>Reeves and Wilkinson (1996), p. 89</ref> and [[Thutmose I]], whose advisor [[Ineni]] notes in his tomb that he advised his king to place his tomb in the desolate valley.
<blockquote>
I saw to the excavation of the rock-tomb of his majesty, alone, no one seeing, no one hearing.<ref>Weigall (1910), p. 186</ref>
</blockquote>

The Valley was used for primary burials from approximately [[1539 BC]] to [[1075 BC]], and contains at least [[#Important_tombs|63 tombs]], beginning with [[Thutmose I]] (or possibly earlier, during the reign of [[Amenhotep I]]), and ending with [[Ramesses X]] or [[Ramesses XI|XI]]. 

Despite the name, the Valley of the Kings also contains the tombs of favorite nobles as well as the wives and children of both nobles and pharaohs. Around the time of [[Ramesses I]] (ca. 1301 BC) construction commenced in the separate [[Valley of the Queens]], although some wives continued to be buried with their husbands in the Valley of the Kings. 

===Royal Necropolis===
The official name for the site in ancient times was ''The Great and Majestic Necropolis of the Millions of Years of the Pharaoh, Life, Strength, Health in The West of Thebes'', or more usually, ''Ta-sekhet-ma'at'' (the Great Field).<ref name="silottip12">Siliotti (1997), pp.12-13</ref>

<hiero>G41-G1-Aa1:D21-O1-O29:Y1-A50-s-Z4:Y1-G7-N35-C11-Z2:N35-M4-M4-M4-t:Z2:N35-O29:O1*O1-G7-S34-U28-s-D2:Z1-R14-t:t-N23*Z1:N35-R19-t:O49-G7</hiero><ref name="silottip12" />

At the start of the [[Eighteenth Dynasty of Egypt|Eighteenth Dynasty]], only the kings were buried within the valley in large tombs, when a non-royal was buried, it was in a small rock cut chamber, close to the tomb of their master <cite name="weigall186" />. [[Amenhotep III]]'s tomb was constructed in the Western Valley, and while his son [[Akhenaten]] moved his tomb's construction to [[Amarna]], it is thought that the unfinished WV25 may have originally been intended for him.<ref>Reeves and Wilkinson (1996), p. 116</ref> With the return to religious orthodoxy at the end of the Eighteenth Dynasty, [[Tutankhamun]], [[Ay]] and then [[Horemheb]] returned to the royal necropolis.

The [[Nineteenth Dynasty of Egypt|Nineteenth]] and [[Twentieth Dynasty of Egypt|Twentieth Dynasties]] saw an increase in the number of burials (both here and in the Valley of the Queens), with [[Ramesses II]] and later [[Ramesses III]] constructing a massive tomb that was used for the burial of his sons ([[KV55]] and [[KV3]] respectively). There are some kings that are not buried within the valley or whose tomb has not been located, [[Thutmose II]] may have been buried in [[Dra' Abu el-Naga']] (although his mummy was in the [[#Deir el-Bahri|Deir el-Bahri]] tomb cache), Smenkhkare's burial has never been located, and [[Ramesses VIII]] seems to have been buried elsewhere.

;Deir el-Medina
<!-- Needs more work -->
The tombs were constructed and decorated by the workers of the village of [[Deir el-Medina]], located in a small wadi between this valley and the [[Valley of the Queens]], facing [[Thebes, Egypt|Thebes]]. The workers journeyed to the tombs via routes over the Theban hills.<ref>{{cite web | title = Introduction to the Deir el-Medina Database  | work = The Deir el-Medina Database | Publisher=Leiden University | url=http://www.leidenuniv.nl/nino/dmd/dmd.html  | accessdate = 2006-12-04 }}</ref>

;Mortuary Temples
<!-- Needs more work -->
{{see|Theban Necropolis}}
In the [[Old Kingdom of Egypt|Pyramid Age]] the tomb of the king was associated with a mortuary temple located close to the pyramid. As the tomb of the king was hidden, this mortuary temple was located away from the burial, closer to the cultivation facing towards [[Thebes, Egypt|Thebes]].

==Exploration of the valley==
The Valley of the Kings has been a major area of modern [[Egyptological]] exploration for the last two centuries. Before this the area was a site for tourism in antiquity (especially during [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] times). This areas illustrates the changes in the study of ancient Egypt, starting as antiquity hunting, and ending as scientific excavation of the whole [[Theban Necropolis]]. Despite the exploration and investigation noted below, only eleven of the tombs have actually been completely recorded.

===Antiquity===
The [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] writers [[Strabo]] (1st century BC) and [[Diodorus Siculus]] (1st century AD) were able to report that the total number of Theban royal tombs was 47, of which at the time only 17 were believed to be undestroyed.<ref name="reeves51">Reeves and Wilkinson (1996), p. 51</ref> [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]] and other ancient writers remarked on the pipe-like corridors of the Valley, clearly meaning the tombs.

Clearly others also visited the valley in these times, as many of the tombs have graffiti written by these ancient tourists. [[Jules Baillet]] located over 2100 Greek and [[Latin]] graffiti, along with a smaller number in [[Phoenician languages|Phoenician]], [[Cypriot]], [[Lycian]], [[Coptic language|Coptic]], and other languages.<ref>Baillet (1920-1926)</ref> <!-- This ref needs a page number --> The majority of the ancient graffiti are found in KV9, containing just under a thousand of them. The earliest positively dated graffito dates to 278 B.C.<ref name="reeves51" />

===Eighteenth century===
Before the nineteenth century, travel from Europe to [[Thebes, Egypt|Thebes]] (and indeed anywhere in [[Egypt]]) was difficult, time-consuming and expensive, and only the hardiest of European travelers visited &ndash; before the travels of [[Father Claude Sicard]] in 1726, it was unclear just where Thebes really was.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.uwm.edu/Course/egypt/0100/discoverersA.html | title=Discovers of Ancient Egypt | accessdate = 2006-12-04 | publisher = University of Wisconsin<U+2013>Milwaukee | work = Egyptian Civilization & Mythology course}}</ref> It was known to be on the [[Nile]], but it was often confused with [[Memphis, Egypt|Memphis]] and several other sites. One of the first travelers to record what he saw at Thebes was [[Frederic Louis Norden]], a [[Denmark|Danish]] adventurer and artist.<ref>{{cite web | title = F.L.

He was followed by [[Richard Pococke]], who published the first modern map of the valley itself, in 1743.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://ias.berkeley.edu/cmes/icmc_files/icmc/richard_pococke.htm | title = Brief biography of Richard Pococke | publisher = UC Berkeley | work =  Center for Middle Eastern Studies | accessdate = 2006-12-06}}</ref>

;French Expedition
In 1799, [[Napoleon]]'s expedition drew maps and plans of the known tombs, and for the first time noted the Western Valley (where  [[Prosper Jollois]] and [[<U+00C9>douard de Villiers du Terrage]] located the tomb of [[Amenhotep III]], [[WV22]]).<ref>Siliotti (1997),  p. 16</ref> The ''[[Description de l'<U+00C9>gypte]]'' contains two volumes (out a total of 24) on the area around Thebes.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://gallica.bnf.fr/Catalogue/noticesInd/FRBNF33341149.htm | title = Description de l'<U+00C9>gypte &ndash; text of the 2nd edition | language = French | publisher = Gallicia | work = Bibliotheque nationale de France | accessdate = 2006-12-04}}</ref>

===Nineteenth century===
[[Image:Entrance to one of the Royal Tombs at Thebes.png|left|275px|thumb|Entrance to a Royal Tomb, drawn in 1821]]
European exploration continued in the area around Thebes during the nineteenth century, boosted by [[Champollion]]'s translation of hieroglyphs early in the century. Early in the century, the area was visited by [[Giovanni Battista Belzoni|Belzoni]], working for [[Henry Salt (Egyptologist)|Henry Salt]], who discovered several tombs, including those of [[Ay]] in the West Valley ([[WV23]]) in 1816 and [[Seti I]] ([[KV17]]) the next year. At the end of his visits, Belzoni declared that all of the tombs had been found and nothing of note remained to be found. Working at the same time (and a great rival of Belzoni and Salt) was [[Bernardino Drovetti]], the [[France|French]] Consul-General.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.travellersinegypt.org/archives/2005/04/bernardino_drovetti.html | work=Travellers In Egypt | title = Bernardino Drovetti | accessdate = 2006-12-04}}</ref>

In 1827 [[John Gardiner Wilkinson]] was assigned to paint the entry of every tomb, giving them each a designation that is still in use today &ndash; they were numbered from KV1 to KV21 (although the maps show 28 entrances, some of which were unexplored).  These paintings and maps were later published in ''The Topography of Thebes and General Survey of Egypt'', in 1830. At the same time [[James Burton (Egyptologist)|James Burton]] explored  the valley. His works included making KV17 safer from flooding, but he is better known for entering KV5. 

Champollion himself visited the valley, along with [[Ippolito Rosellini]] and [[Nestor L'H<U+00F4>te]], in the [[Franco-Tuscan Expedition]] of 1829. The expedition spent two months studying the open tombs, visiting about 16 of them. They copied the inscriptions and identified the original tomb owners. In tomb KV17, they removed wall decorations, which are now on display in the [[Louvre]] in [[Paris]].
[[Image:Old Valley of the tombs of the kings.png|225px|right|thumb|Drawing of the valley showing open tombs from 1862]]
In 1845 &ndash; 1846 the valley was explored by [[Karl Richard Lepsius]]'s expedition, they explored and documented 25 in the main valley and four in the west.

The later half of the century saw a more concerted effort to preserve rather than simply gathering antiquities. [[Auguste Mariette]]'s Egyptian Antiquities Service started to explore the valley, first with [[Eug<U+00E8>ne Lef<U+00E9>bure]] in 1883,<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.kv-10.com/project.htm | work = Amenmesse Project | title = Project Amenmesse Homepage | accessdate = 2006-12-04}}</ref> then [[Jules Baillet]] and [[Georges B<U+00E9>n<U+00E9>dite]] in early 1888 and finally [[Victor Loret]] in 1898 to 1899. During this time [[Georges <U+00C9>mile Jules Daressy|Georges Daressy]] explored KV9 and KV6.

Loret added a further 16 tombs to the list, and explored several tombs that had already been discovered.

When [[Gaston Maspero]] was reappointed to head the Egyptian Antiquities Service, the nature of the exploration of the valley changed again, Maspero appointed [[Howard Carter]] as the Chief Inspector of Upper Egypt and the young man discovered several new tombs and explored several others, clearing KV42 and KV20.

===Twentieth century===
Around the turn of the twentieth century, the [[USA|American]] [[Theodore M. Davis]] had the excavation permit in the valley, and his team (led mostly by [[Edward R. Ayrton]]) discovered several royal and non-royal tombs ([[KV43]], [[KV46]] & [[KV57]] being the most important). In 1907 they discovered the possible Amarna Period cache in KV55. After finding what they thought was the burial of Tutankhamun (KV61), it was announced that the valley was completely explored and no further burials were to be found.
[[Image:Horemheb tomb entrance.png|thumb|right|225px|Entrance to Horemheb's tomb, soon after discovery in 1908]]

[[Howard Carter]] then acquired the right to explore the valley and after a systematic search discovered the actual tomb of Tutankhamun (KV62) in November 1922. 

At the end of the century, the [[Theban Mapping Project]] re-discovered and explored tomb KV5, which has since been discovered to be probably the largest in the valley (having at least 120 rooms), and was either a [[cenotaph]] or real burial for the sons of Ramesses II. Elsewhere in the eastern and western branches of the valley several other expeditions cleared and studied other tombs. Until 2002 the [[Amarna Royal Tombs Project]] has been exploring the area around KV55 and KV62, the Amarna Period tombs in the main valley.

=== Twenty-first century===
Various expeditions have continued to explore the valley, adding greatly to the knowledge of the area. In 2001 the [[Theban Mapping Project]] designed new signs for the tombs, providing information and plans of the open tombs. 

On [[February 8]], [[2006]], the [[Supreme Council of Antiquities]] announced that an [[USA|American]] team led by the [[University of Memphis]] had uncovered a pharaonic-era tomb ([[KV63]]), the first uncovered there since King Tutankhamun's in 1922.  The 18th Dynasty tomb included five mummies in intact sarcophagi with coloured funerary masks along with more than 20 large storage jars, sealed with pharaonic seals. It is located close to the tomb of Tutankhamun. KV63, as it is known, appears to be a single chamber with five or six sarcophagi and about 20 large funerary jars. The chamber is from the 18th dynasty and it appears to have been a deposit of funerary preparation materials, rather than a tomb.

On [[31 July]] [[2006]], [[Nicholas Reeves]] announced that analysis of [[ground penetrating radar]] for the autumn of 2000 showed a sub-surface anomaly in the area of KV62 and KV63.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.valleyofthekings.org/vofk/default.htm | title = Another new tomb in the Valley of the Kings: <U+2018>KV64<U+2019> | accessdate = 2006-12-04}}</ref> He has tentatively labeled this anomaly "KV64".<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.archaeology.org/online/interviews/reeves.html | title = Nicholas Reeves interview | accessdate = 2006-12-04 | work = Archaeology Magazine}}</ref> This has caused some controversy, as only Egypt's [[Supreme Council of Antiquities]] can officially designate the name of a new tomb, the anomaly may not in fact be a tomb, and because Reeves had reported the finding to the press first, instead of a scientific paper.<ref name=USAControversy>{{cite web | author = Vergano, Dan | url=http://www.usatoday.com/tech/science/columnist/vergano/2006-08-13-egyptian-controversy_x.htm | title = Egyptian tomb digs up controversy | publisher = USA Today | date=2006-08-14 | accessdate = 2006-12-04}}</ref>

==Tomb development==
: ''See also:'' [[List of burials in the Valley of the Kings]] for full list of burials
;Architecture
[[Image:Tombe_TaousertetSethnakht.jpg|right|thumb|200px|The tomb of Twosret and Setnakhte showing descending corridor]]
The usual tomb plan of a long inclined rock-cut corridor, descending through one or more halls (possibly mirroring the descending path of the sun-god into the underworld<ref>Strudwick and Strudwick (1999),  p. 117</ref>), to the burial chamber. In the earlier tombs the corridors turn through 90 degrees at least once (such as [[KV43]], the tomb of [[Thutmose IV]]), and the earliest had cartouche-shaped burial chambers ([[KV43]], the tomb of [[Thutmose IV]]). This layout is known as 'Bent Axis', and after the burial the upper corridors were meant to be filled with rubble, and the entrance to the tomb hidden.<ref>Strudwick and Strudwick (1999), p. 98</ref> After the [[Amarna period]], the layout gradually straightened, with an intermediate 'Jogged Axis' (the tomb of [[Horemheb]], [[KV57]] is typical of this, and is one of the tombs that is sometimes open to the public), to the generally 'Straight Axis' of the late Nineteenth and Twentieth Dynasty tombs ([[Ramesses III]]'s and [[Ramesses IX]]'s tombs, [[KV11]] and [[KV6]] respectively).<ref>Reeves and Wilkinson (1996), p. 25</ref> Another feature that is common to most tombs is the 'well', which may have originated as an actual barrier intended to stop flood waters entering the lower parts of the tombs. It later seems to have developed a 'magical' purpose as a symbolical shaft. In the later Twentieth Dynasty, the well itself was sometimes not excavated, but the well room was still present.

;Decoration
{{main|Ancient Egyptian funerary texts}}
<!-- Need to add more here -->
[[Image:Grabmalereien.jpg|right|thumb|200px|KV2]]
The majority of the royal tombs were decorated with religious texts and images. The early tombs were decorated with scenes from [[Amduat]] ('That Which is in the Underworld'), with describes the journey of the sun-god through the twelve hours of the night. From the time of Horemheb, tombs were decorated with the [[Book of Gates]], which shows the sun-god passing through the twelve gates that divide the night time, and ensure the tomb owner's own safe passage through the night. 

Late in the Nineteenth Dynasty the [[Book of Caverns]], which divided the underworld into massive caverns containing deities and the deceased waiting for the sun to pass through and restore them to life. The burial of Ramesses III saw the [[Book of the Earth]], where the underworld is divided into 4 sections, climaxing in the sun disc being pulled from the earth by [[Nun]]. 

The ceilings of the burial chambers were decorated (from the burial of Seti I onwards) with what become formalised as the [[Book of the Heavens]], which again describe the sun's journey through the twelve hours of night. Again from Seti I's time, the [[Litany of Re]], a lengthy hymn to the sun god.
[[Image:Seti pillar.png|175px|thumb|right|Pillar in Seti I's tomb]]
;Tomb equipment
Each burial was provided with equipment that would enable them a continued existence in the afterlife in comfort. Also present in the tombs were ritual magical items, such as [[Shabti]]'s and divine figurines. Some equipment was that which the king may have used in their lifetime ([[Tutankhamun]]'s sandles for example), and some was specially constructed for the burial.

[[Image:East Valley of the Kings Sketch Map.jpg|left|thumb|550px|Sketch map of the Eastern Valley]]
The abbreviation "KV" stands for "Kings' Valley", and the tombs are numbered in the order of 'discovery' from [[Ramesses VII]] ([[KV1]]) to [[KV63]] (which was discovered in 2005), although many of the tombs have been open since antiquity, and [[KV5]] was only rediscovered in the 1990s (after being dismissed as unimportant by previous investigators).<ref>Weigall (1910), p. 198</ref> A number of the tombs are unoccupied, the owners of others remain unknown, and others are merely pits used for storage.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.plu.edu/~ryandp/Observ2.html | author = Donald P.

===Eighteenth Dynasty===
[[Image:Egypt.KV34.07.jpg|right|thumb|200px|KV34]]
The Eighteenth dynasty tombs within the valley vary a good deal in decoration, style and location. At first there seems to have been no fixed plan, indeed the [[KV20|tomb]] of [[Hatshepsut]] is of a unique shape, twisting and turning down over 200&nbsp;metres from the entrance so that the burial chamber is 97&nbsp;metres below the surface. The tombs gradually became more regular and formalised, and the tomb's of [[Thutmose III]] and [[Thutmose IV]], [[KV34]] and [[KV43]] are good examples of Eighteenth Dynasty tombs, both with their bent axis, and simple decoration.
[[Image:Bentaxis.png|left|thumb|150px|Typical 'Bent axis' early Eighteenth Dynasty tomb]]

Perhaps the most imposing tomb of this period is that of [[Amenhotep III]], [[WV22]] located in the West Valley.<ref>{{web cite | author = El-Aref, Nevine | url=http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/2004/676/he1.htm | title=Sleuthing in a royal tomb | work=Al-Ahram Weekly Online | issue = 676 | date=2004-02-11 | accessdate = 2006-12-04 }} </ref> It was been re&ndash;investigated in 1990s (by a team from [[Waseda University]], [[Japan]]), but is not open to the public.<ref>{{web cite | url=http://www.waseda.jp/prj-egypt/sites/KV22-E.html| title=INTERIM REPORT ON THE RE-CLEARANCE AT THE ROYAL TOMB OF AMENOPHIS III | work=Research in Egypt 1966-1991 | publisher=Institute of Egyptology at Waseda University | year=1991 | accessdate = 2006-12-04 }} </ref>

At the same time, powerful and influential nobles started to be buried with the royal family, the most famous of these tombs is the 
joint tomb of [[Yuya]] and [[Tjuyu]], [[KV46]]. They were possibly the parents of Queen [[Tiy]], and until the discovery of the tomb of Tutankhamun, this was the best preserved tomb to be found in the Valley.

====Amarna Period====
The return of royal burials to Thebes after the end of Amarna period marks a change to the layout of royal burials, with the intermediate 'jogged axis' gradually giving way to the 'straight axis' of later dynasties. In the Western valley, there is a tomb commencement that is thought to have been started for [[Akhenaten]], but is no more than a gateway and a series of steps. Close by to this tomb is the tomb of [[Ay]], [[Tutankhamun]]'s successor. It is likely that this tomb was started for Tutankhamun (it's decoration is of a similar style), but later usurped for Ay's burial (this would mean that [[KV62]] may have been Ay's original tomb, which would explain the smaller size and unusual layout for a royal tomb). 

The other Amarna period tombs are located in a smaller, central area in the centre of the East Valley, with a possible mummy cache ([[KV55]]) that possibly contains the possible burials of several Amarna Period royals &ndash; [[Tiy]] and [[Smenkhkare]] or [[Akhenaten]].<ref>Davis (2001), p.XV</ref>
[[Image:Egypt.KV62.01.jpg|right|thumb|200px|KV62]]
Close to this is the burial of Tutankhamun, perhaps the most famous discovery of modern Western [[archaeology]] and was made here by [[Howard Carter]] on [[November 4]], [[1922]], with clearance and conservation work continuing until 1932. This was the first royal tomb to be discovered that was still largely intact (although tomb robbers had entered it), and was, until the excavation of [[KV63]] on [[10 March]] [[2005]].<ref>{{cite web | publisher = MSNBC | url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/11252094 | title=Egypt offers first look at newly discovered tomb: First such discovery in Valley of the Kings since Tutankhamun<U+2019>s in 1922 | date = 2006-02-10 | accessdate = 2006-12-04}}</ref>, considered the last major discovery in the valley. The opulence of his grave goods notwithstanding, [[Tutankhamun]] was a rather minor king and other burials probably had more numerous treasures. 

In the same central area as KV62 and KV63, is '[[KV64]]' a radar anomaly believed to be a tomb or chamber announced on [[28 July]] [[2006]]. It is not an official designation, and indeed the actual existence of a tomb at all is dismissed by the [[Supreme Council of Antiquities]].<ref name=USAControversy/>

The nearby tomb of [[Horemheb]], ([[KV57]]) is rarely open for visitors, but it is superbly decorated and has excellent tomb paintings.

===Nineteenth Dynasty===
[[Image:Straightaxis.png|left|thumb|150px|Typical 'Straight axis' Nineteenth/Twentieth Dynasty tomb]]
The nineteenth dynasty saw a further standardisation of tomb layout and decoration. The tomb of the first king of the dynasty [[Ramesses I]] was hurriedly finished (due to the death of the king), and is little more than a descending corridor and a burial chamber, however [[KV16]] has vibrant decoration, and still contains the [[sarcophagus]] of the king. Its central location means that it is one of the frequently visited tombs. It shows the development of the tomb entrance and passage and of decoration.

His son and successor, [[Seti I]]'s tomb, [[KV17]] (also known as ''Belzoni's tomb'', ''the tomb of Apis'', or ''the tomb of Psammis, son of Necho'') is usually thought to be the finest tomb in the valley, with well executed relief work and paintings.

The son of Seti, [[Ramesses II|Ramesses the Great]] constructed a massive tomb, [[KV7]], but it is in a ruinous state, and it is currently undergoing excavation and conservation by a Franco-Egyptian team led by [[Christian Leblanc]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://ourworld.compuserve.com/homepages/Gerard_Flament/ramstomb.htm | title = The Tomb of Ramesses II and Remains of His Funerary Treasure | author = Christian Leblanc | accessdate = 2006-12-04}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.culture.gouv.fr/culture/arcnat/thebes/fr/rectomauj.htm | title = Recherches et travaux dans la tombe de Ramses II: Aujour<U+010F>hui | work = Recherches et Travaux Tombe Ramses | publisher = L'Institut d'Egyptologie Th<U+00E9>baine du Mus<U+00E9>e du Louvre | accessdate = 2006-12-04 | language = French}}</ref> It is a vast size, being about the same length, and a larger area, of the tomb of his father. Its layout returns to the earlier 'bent axis', maybe due to the poor quality of the rock found during excavation.

At the same time (and just opposite his own tomb), Ramesses enlarged the earlier small tomb of an unknown Eighteenth Dynasty noble ([[KV5]]) for his numerous sons. With 120 known rooms and excavation work still underway, it is probably the largest tomb in the valley. Originally opened (and robbed) in antiquity it is a low-lying structure that has been particularly prone to the flash floods that sometimes hit the area, which washed in tones of debris and material over the centuries, ultimately concealing its vast size. It is not currently open to the public.<!--<ref>Weeks (2000). p.????</ref>--> <!-- This ref needs a page number -->

[[Image:Egypt.KV8.01.jpg|right|thumb|200px|KV8]]

Ramesses II's son and eventual successor, [[Merenptah]]'s [[KV8|tomb]] has been open since antiquity, it extends 160 metres, ending in a burial chamber that once contained a set of four nested [[Sarcophagus|sarcophagi]].<ref>Weigall (1910), p. 202</ref> Well decorated, it is typically open to the public most years.

The last kings of the dynasty also constructed tombs in the valley, all of which follow the same general pattern of layout and decoration, notable amongst these is the [[KV47|tomb]] of [[Siptah]], which is well decorated, especially the ceiling decoration.<ref>Davis (2001), p.1</ref>

===Twentieth Dynasty===
The first ruler of the dynasty, [[Setnakhte]] actually had 2 tombs constructed for himself, he started to excavate the eventual tomb of his son, [[Ramesses III]] but broke into another tomb, and abandoned it in order to usurp and complete the [[KV14|tomb]] of the Nineteenth dynasty female pharaoh [[Twosret]]. This tomb therefore has two burial chambers, the later extensions making the tomb one of the largest of the Royal tombs, at over 112 metres. 

[[Image:Luxor, Tal der K<U+00F6>nige, Grab von Thutmosis III. (1, 1995, 800x570).jpg|right|thumb|200px|KV11]]
The [[KV11|tomb]] of [[Ramesses III]] (known ''Bruce's Tomb, The Harper's Tomb'') is one of the largest tombs in the valley, and is open to the public, it is located close to the central 'rest&ndash;area', and is location and superb decoration usually makes this one of the tombs visited by tourists.<ref>Weigall (1910), p. 206</ref>

The successors and offspring of [[Ramesses III]] constructed tombs that had straight axes, and were decorated in much the same manner as each other, notable amongst these are [[KV2]], the tomb of [[Ramesses IV]], which has been open since antiquity, containing a large amount of [[hieratic]] graffiti. The tomb is mostly intact and is decorated with scenes from several religious texts.<ref>Weigall (1910), p. 196</ref> The joint tomb of [[Ramesses V]] and [[Ramesses VI]], [[KV9]] (also known as the ''Tomb of Memnon'' or ''La Tombe de la M<U+00E9>tempsychose'') is decorated with many sunk-relief carvings, depicting many illustrated scenes from religious texts. Open since antiquity, it contains over a thousand graffiti in ancient Greek, Latin and Coptic.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.kv5.com/sites/browse_tomb_823.html | publisher = Theban Mapping project | title = KV 9 (Rameses V and Rameses VI) | accessdate = 2006-12-04}}</ref> The spoil from the excavation and later clearance of this tomb covered the earlier burial of KV62 and seems to have been what protected that tomb from earlier discovery and looting.

[[Image:Egypt.KV6.02.jpg|right|thumb|200px|KV6]]
The tomb of [[Ramesses IX]], [[KV6]] has been open since antiquity, as can be seen by the graffiti left on its walls by Roman and Coptic visitors.<ref>Weigall (1910), p. 198</ref> Located in the central part of the Valley, it stands between and slightly above KV5 and KV55. The tomb extends a total distance of 105 metres into the hillside, including extensive side chambers which were neither decorated nor finished. The hasty and incomplete nature of the rock-cutting and decorations within the tomb indicate that that the tomb was not completed by the time of Ramesses' death. 

Another notable tomb from this dynasty is [[KV19]] the tomb of [[Mentuherkhepshef]] (son of [[Ramesses IX]]). The tomb is small and is really just a converted, unfinished corridor, but the decoration is superb and the tomb has been newly restored and open for visitors.

===Twenty-first Dynasty and the decline of the necropolis===
By the end of the New Kingdom, Egypt had entered a long period of political and economic decline. The priests at Thebes grew in power and effectively administered Upper Egypt, while kings ruling from [[Tanis, Egypt|Tanis]] controlled Lower Egypt. Some attempt at using the open tombs was made at the start of the Twenty first Dynasty, with the [[Theban High Priests of Amun (Twenty-first dynasty)|High Priest of Amun]] [[Pinedjem I]] adding his cartouche to [[KV4]].<ref>Reeves and Wilkinson (1996), p. 208</ref> The Valley began to be heavily plundered, so during the [[Twenty-first dynasty of Egypt|21st Dynasty]] the priests of [[Amen]] opened most of the tombs and moved the mummies into three tombs in order to better protect them, even removing most of their treasure in order to further protect the bodies from robbers. Later most of these were moved to a single cache near [[#Deir el-Bahri|Deir el-Bari]] (known as [[DB320|TT320]]), located in the cliffs overlooking [[Hatshepsut]]'s famous temple, this mass reburial contained an astounding number of royal mummies.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tt320.org | publisher = Russian Academy of Sciences Centre for Egyptological Studies | title = CACHETTE of the Royal Mummies | accessdate = 2006-12-05}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | title=Palmer, Lucia A. Oriental Days | url=http://www.travellersinegypt.org/archives/2005/03/the_finding_of_the_pharaohs.html | title=The Finding of the Pharaohs | publisher= TravellersInEgypt.org | accessdate = 2006-12-04}}</ref> They were found in a great state of disorder, many placed in other's coffins, and several are still unidentified. Other mummies were moved to the [[KV35|tomb]] of [[Amenhotep II]], were over a dozen mummies, many of them royal, were later relocated here.<ref name="weigall221">Weigall (1910), p. 221</ref>

During the later [[Third Intermediate Period]] and later periods, intrusive burials were introduced into many of the open tombs. In [[Coptic]] times, some of the tombs were used as churches, stables and even houses.

=== Tomb robbers ===
Almost all of the tombs have been ransacked, including Tutankhamun's, though in its case, it seems that the robbers were interrupted, so very little was removed.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalegypt.ucl.ac.uk/thebes/tombs/kings.html | title = Valley of the Kings, finds in the Petrie Museum | Publisher = UCL | work = Digital Egypt | accessdate = 2006-12-04}}</ref>  Several [[papyrus]] have been found that describe the trials of tomb robbers, these date mostly from the late Twentieth Dynasty. One of these (Papyrus Mayer B) describes the robbery of the tomb of Ramesses VI and was probably written in Year 9 of Ramesses IX.

<blockquote>
The foreigner Nesamun took us up and showed us the tomb of King Ramesses VI ... And I spent four days breaking into it, we being present all five. We opened the tomb and entered it. ... We found a cauldron of bronze, three wash bowls of bronze ...<ref>Reeves and Wilkinson (1996), p. 192</ref>
</blockquote>

<!-- I find this bit rather too precise! 
The valley was surrounded by steep cliffs and heavily guarded. In [[1090 BC]], or ''the year of the Hyena'', there was a collapse in Egypt's economy leading to the emergence of tomb robbers. Because of this, it was also the last year that the valley was used for burial. 
-->
The valley also seems to have suffered an official plundering during the [[Whm Mswt|virtual civil war]] which started in the reign of [[Ramesses XI]]. The tombs were opened, all the valuables removed, and the mummies collected into two large caches. One in the tomb of [[Amenhotep II]], contained sixteen, and others were hidden within [[Amenhotep I]]'s tomb. A few years later most of them were moved to the so-called [[Deir el-Bahri]] cache, contained no less than forty royal mummies and their coffins.<ref>Weigall (1910), p. 191</ref> Only those tombs whose locations were lost ([[KV62]], [[KV63]] and [[KV46]]) were undisturbed in this period.

==Tourism==
[[Image:Luxor, Tal der K<U+00F6>nige (1995, 860x605).jpg|right|thumb|250px|View of the central East Valley, showing area around [[KV62]]]]

Most of the tombs are not open to the public (16 of the tombs can be opened, but they are rarely open at the same time), and officials occasionally close those that are open for restoration work.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://touregypt.net/teblog/luxornews/?p=287 | title= What tombs are open in the Valley of Kings | year =2006 |  publisher=TourEgypt.net| accessdate = 2006-12-04}}</ref> The number of visitors to KV62 has led to a separate charge for entry into the tomb. The West Valley has only one open tomb &ndash; that of Ay &ndash; and a separate ticket is needed to visit this tomb. The tour guides are no longer allowed to lecture inside the tombs and visitors are expected to proceed quietly and in single file through the tombs. This is to minimize time in the tombs, and prevent the crowds from damaging the surfaces of the decoration. Photography is no longer allowed in the tombs. 

In [[1997]], 58 tourists and 4 Egyptians were [[November 1997 Luxor massacre|massacred]] at nearby [[Deir el-Bahri]]
by Islamist militants from [[Al-Gama'a al-Islamiyya]]. This led to an overall drop in tourism in the area.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/32179.stm | title=Tourists massacred at temple | publisher = BBC News | date=1997-11-17 | accessdate = 2006-12-04}}</ref>

As of 2005, on most days of the week an average of four to five thousand tourists visit the main valley. On the days on which the [[Nile]] Cruises arrive the number can rise to nearly ten thousand.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.kv5.com/articles/article_2.5.html | title=The Valley Today | work=Theban Mapping Project |accessdate = 2006-12-04}}</ref> These levels are expected to rise to 25,000 by 2015. The West Valley is much less visited, as there is only one tomb that is open to the public.

In January 2006 it was announced that a new visitors centre was to be constructed. <ref>{{cite web | title = First World Visitors Center opens in Valley of Kings | date = 2006-01-10 | work = Egyptian State Information Service | url=http://www.sis.gov.eg/En/EgyptOnline/Culture/000001/0203000000000000000547.htm | accessdate = 2006-12-04 }}</ref> Constructed on the old cafeteria, it is planned to open in early 2007.<ref>{{cite web | title = August 2006 Progress report | url=http://www.thebanmappingproject.com/about/progress_19.html | work=Theban Mapping Project | accessdate=2006-12-04 }}</ref> It will have displays and exhibits (including a model of the valley), showing the chronology and iconography of the New Kingdom necropolis. The [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] and [[National Geographic Society]] have donated display and educational material.
