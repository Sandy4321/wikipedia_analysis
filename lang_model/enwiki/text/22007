==Mayor of Houston==
[[Image:Bill White (2006).jpg|left|thumb]]

In 2003, White, a Caucasian [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]], ran in Houston's officially nonpartisan mayoral election to succeed [[term limit|term-limited]] Mayor [[Lee Brown]], who was the first African-American mayor of the city. Running as a moderate with business experience, he appealed to Democrats as well as many Republicans despite having almost no name recognition. In fact, White's television ads mainly consisted of a plain white background with himself in the middle of the screen and a black bar displaying info such as his campaign website in the lower third of the screen.

White faced off against Republican former Houston City Councilman [[Orlando Sanchez (politician)|Orlando Sanchez]], a Cuban-American who unsuccessfully challenged Brown in a heated 2001 bid to become Houston's first Hispanic mayor, and black Democratic Texas State Representative [[Sylvester Turner]], who also ran for mayor in 1991 (against then-incumbent [[Kathryn J. Whitmire|Kathy Whitmire]] and real estate developer [[Bob Lanier (politician)|Bob Lanier]]) but was embroiled in an insurance scandal exposed in an investigation by Houston's [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] affiliate, [[KTRK-TV]] that eventually led to a 1996 lawsuit; Lanier went on to defeat Whitmire.

In the November election, White, along with Sanchez, defeated Turner. In the runoff, White defeated Sanchez with 63 percent of the vote.

Mayor White is a member of the [[Mayors Against Illegal Guns Coalition]],<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.mayorsagainstillegalguns.org/html/about/members.shtml| title= Coalition Members
|publisher=Mayors Against Illegal Guns:}</ref> a [[bi-partisan]] group with a stated goal of "making the public safer by getting illegal guns off the streets." The Coalition is co-chaired by [[Boston]] Mayor [[Thomas Menino]] and [[New York City]] Mayor [[Michael Bloomberg]]. 

===First term===
Bill White's first term as mayor of Houston began on January 2, 2004. He gained great popularity during this term, which led to overwhelming support for his reelection. 

During this term, Houston hosted [[Super Bowl XXXVIII]], the [[2004 MLB All-Star Game]], the [[2006 NBA All-Star Game]] and the [[2005 World Series]]. These events have been great boosts to Houston's economy.<ref>[http://www.boston.com/news/nation/articles/2004/01/26/in_the_super_bowl_spotlight_houston_seeks_boost_in_respect/ http://www.boston.com/news/nation/articles/2004/01/26/in_the_super_bowl_spotlight_houston_seeks_boost_in_respect/]</ref><ref>[http://www.bizjournals.com/houston/stories/2004/01/05/editorial3.html http://www.bizjournals.com/houston/stories/2004/01/05/editorial3.html]</ref> He also led the building of Houston's [[Metropolitan Transit Authority of Harris County, Texas|Metro]] [[METRORail|light rail system]]. 

In the aftermath of [[Hurricane Katrina]], thousands of residents of New Orleans were displaced. Bill White offered refuge for the victims in Houston's [[Astrodome]] and [[George R. Brown Convention Center]]. He also set up programs to help them find long-term housing, job placement, and education within Houston. He was later awarded the [[John F. Kennedy Profile in Courage Award]] for his service in the light of this catastrophe.<ref>[http://www.jfklibrary.org/Education+and+Public+Programs/Profile+in+Courage+Award/Award+Recipients/Bill+White/ Profile in Courage Award Recipient Bill White]</ref>

Just weeks after [[Hurricane Katrina]], it looked as though Houston would become the target of [[Hurricane Rita]]. Bill White mobilized the citizens of Houston to evacuate. During a series of press conferences, Mayor White and County Judge Robert Eckels instructed Houstonians on when to evacuate.<ref>[http://www.houstontx.gov/mayor/press/20050921a.html Press Release: Mayor Bill White, County Judge Robert Eckels Call For Voluntary Evacuations of Flood Areas and Mobile Homes]</ref> Officials employed a strategy that called for the evacuation of flood prone areas first. This evacuation, however, led to many problems as it caused multi-hour backups on all freeways in Houston. This prompted White to later lead an evacuation plan reform for Houston.<ref>[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/ralph-dittman/houston-mayor-bill-white_b_7897.html?view=screen Huffington Post - "Houston: Mayor Bill White is a Problem-Solving Machine"]</ref>

In 2005 White initiated the [[SafeClear Program]], designed to quickly clear roads and freeways of stalled vehicles.<ref>[http://www.houstontx.gov/safeclear/chron-20050609.html http://www.houstontx.gov/safeclear/chron-20050609.html]</ref> This led to great controversy when it was first started, however, for several reasons. Tow truck drivers claimed that the program hurt their business and nine wrecker companies filed lawsuits against the city. White testified in court in the case.<ref>[http://www.click2houston.com/news/8165439/detail.html http://www.click2houston.com/news/8165439/detail.html]</ref> In addition the SafeClear Program has been blamed for causing the deaths of people, who seemed to be trying to get their cars off the freeway without having to pay fees to the tow truck drivers. The cause of death of these people, however, is uncertain.<ref>[http://www.khou.com/news/local/houstonmetro/stories/khou050201_cd_womanhit.658541ac.html http://www.khou.com/news/local/houstonmetro/stories/khou050201_cd_womanhit.658541ac.html]</ref><ref>[http://www.click2houston.com/news/4149837/detail.html http://www.click2houston.com/news/4149837/detail.html]</ref> White responded to the controversy and criticism by changing the rules the program and the towing laws, including free towing for limited distances funded by the city.<ref>[http://www.click2houston.com/news/4156259/detail.html http://www.click2houston.com/news/4156259/detail.html]</ref><ref>[http://www.click2houston.com/news/4063222/detail.html http://www.click2houston.com/news/4063222/detail.html]</ref> He also rode with a wrecker<ref>[http://www.click2houston.com/automotive/4049247/detail.html http://www.click2houston.com/automotive/4049247/detail.html]</ref> and conducted several studies of the program. Despite the controversy, independent studies have found that the program has helped.<ref>[http://www.kuhf.org/site/News2?JServSessionIdr008=2con2bpdo1.app5b&page=NewsArticle&id=15374&news_iv_ctrl=1521 http://www.kuhf.org/site/News2?JServSessionIdr008=2con2bpdo1.app5b&page=NewsArticle&id=15374&news_iv_ctrl=1521]</ref><ref>[http://www.houstontx.gov/safeclear/oneyear/safeclear-oneyear.pdf http://www.houstontx.gov/safeclear/oneyear/safeclear-oneyear.pdf]</ref>

White also slightly lowered Houstonians' property tax in 2006 and again during the next four years gaining him support from local [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]].<ref>[http://pressmediawire.com/article.cfm?articleID=18954 http://pressmediawire.com/article.cfm?articleID=18954]</ref> White also led neighborhood water sewage improvements, a reform of the city's pension fund, lowered Houston's high crime rate and began a local recycling campaign known as [http://www.houstontx.gov/planning/general/TrashHouston/TH_home.htm "Stop Trashing Houston"] to discourage littering.

===Second term===
[[Image:White, Bill (2007).jpg|right|thumb|Bill White speaking at a dinner in 2007]]
In 2005, White was challenged for re-election by minor and perennial candidates and won re-election with 91 percent of the vote &mdash; the highest percentage received by a mayoral candidate in Houston in 60 years.<ref>[http://www.citymayors.com/politics/usa_elections05.html http://www.citymayors.com/politics/usa_elections05.html]</ref>

During his second term, White focused his work on improving graduation rates in the city's high schools, enforcing air pollution standards, reducing the possibility of flooding in newer areas, adopted a more flexible system of working hours, and capitalized even further on his business experience to create public-private initiatives with private business and community organizations to stimulate growth in the city's most neglected subdivisions.

In 2005, White formed the Mayor<U+2019>s Wellness Council and launched the [http://www.getmovinghouston.com/overview.htm Get Moving Houston] fitness campaign. Houston had previously been rated <U+201C>Fattest City in America" by Men<U+2019>s Fitness magazine. White started this campaign to improve the heath and welfare of the citizens of Houston. The campaign has had success, lowering Houston's rating from first to tenth in three years.<ref>[http://www.getmovinghouston.com/overview.htm http://www.getmovinghouston.com/overview.htm]</ref>  

In 2006, White proposed a series of eight city propositions aimed at improving infrastructure without a tax increase. All eight city propositions passed in a November 2006 election.

White worked to create the [[Discovery Green]] park in Houston, which held its groundbreaking in October 2006. Mayor White's 2008 inauguration was held at the park. The park officially opened to the public in April 2008 with a ribbon cutting led by White.<ref>[http://www.discoverygreen.com/en/cms/?1042 http://www.discoverygreen.com/en/cms/?1042]</ref>

In 2007, the FBI released a report showing an increase in Houston's murder rate. While some speculated about the impact of Hurricane Katrina victims  who settled on the Southwest side of town, Mayor White released a [http://www.houstontx.gov/mayor/press/20070605.html statement] concerning the FBI's findings:

"With the regard to the 2006 figures now being reported, the FBI calculated a murder rate per 100,000 people for Houston based on census estimates of a 2,073,729 population as of July 1, 2005. That was before Houston<U+2019>s population swelled by well over 100,000 people. On the basis of U.S. Post Office change of address information we estimated the 2006 population at 2,198,755.  While it is normally fair to make year-to-year comparisons based on population estimates that lag crimes by a year or more, the unusual increase in Houston<U+2019>s population for 2006 makes our City<U+2019>s figures for the murder rate per 100,000 not quite comparable to the rate in other communities in 2005."

Energy conservation topped the Mayor's list of concerns in 2007.<ref>[http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/business/realestate/4983952.html http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/business/realestate/4983952.html]</ref> Via the City's [http://www.houstonpowertopeople.com/index.htm Power to People Web site], Mayor White encourages energy conservation through tips and tools, education about tax incentives, and raffles. 

In 2007, White was honored the [[John F. Kennedy Profile in Courage Award]] for his service during [[Hurricane Katrina]].<ref>[http://www.jfklibrary.org/Education+and+Public+Programs/Profile+in+Courage+Award/Award+Recipients/Bill+White/ JFK Profile in Courage Award Recipients]</ref>
He was also awarded the [[FBI]]'s Director's Community Leadership Award for lowering Houston's crime rate stating that "Mayor White made public safety one of his highest priorities, as evidenced by Houston's decreasing crime rate."<ref>[http://hcnonline.com/articles/2008/12/29/woodlands_villager/news/wv-n_bil_white_pr.txt http://hcnonline.com/articles/2008/12/29/woodlands_villager/news/wv-n_bil_white_pr.txt]</ref><ref>[http://blogs.chron.com/cityhall/archives/2008/01/fbi_award.html http://blogs.chron.com/cityhall/archives/2008/01/fbi_award.html]</ref>

During White's second term he focused on reducing the number of car accidents in Houston. To do this, he started a campaign to stop drunk driving. He led a summit, hosted by [[Mothers Against Drunk Driving]].<ref>[http://66.218.69.11/search/cache?ei=UTF-8&p=drunk+driving+bill+white&xa=c7OVVMvDbBQZ1WVRzisVXg--%2C1232668729&fr=yfp-t-501&u=www.hgactrans.org/Safety/slides/2007/Wise%2520HGAC%25202007.ppt&w=drunk+drink+driving+bill+white&d=RalFEA-YR-ut&icp=1&.intl=us http://66.218.69.11/search/cache?ei=UTF-8&p=drunk+driving+bill+white&xa=c7OVVMvDbBQZ1WVRzisVXg--%2C1232668729&fr=yfp-t-501&u=www.hgactrans.org/Safety/slides/2007/Wise%2520HGAC%25202007.ppt&w=drunk+drink+driving+bill+white&d=RalFEA-YR-ut&icp=1&.intl=us]</ref> He also presented a plan to increase enforcement, education, and public awareness. This included installing signs around the Houston area warning of drunk driving and urging people to dial *DWI if they suspect someone of drunk driving.<ref>[http://www.txcn.com/sharedcontent/dws/txcn/houston/stories/khou060903_cd_dwisign.6384990d.html http://www.txcn.com/sharedcontent/dws/txcn/houston/stories/khou060903_cd_dwisign.6384990d.html]</ref> Also, at the recommendation of Houston Police Chief [[Harold Hurtt]], White had 50 [[Red light camera|red-light cameras]] installed around Houston's metropolitan area.<ref>[http://www.chron.com/mm/ymap/lightcams/ http://www.chron.com/mm/ymap/lightcams/]</ref> Four intersections were originally used to test the traffic cameras in September 2006. The trial cameras met the requirements and were approved for using throughout the city. The red-light cameras caused a great deal of controversy, even leading to some lawsuits. Many people accused the city, claiming this was just for the city to make money and claiming that they actually increase accidents.<ref>[http://www.thetruthaboutcars.com/accidents-double-at-houston-red-light-camera-locations/ http://www.thetruthaboutcars.com/accidents-double-at-houston-red-light-camera-locations/]</ref> However, an independent study by [[Texas A&M University]] found that they actually accidents by 30%.<ref>[http://www.kbtx.com/home/headlines/35497794.html http://www.kbtx.com/home/headlines/35497794.html]</ref><ref>[http://bigcountryhomepage.com/content/fulltext/?cid=85461 http://bigcountryhomepage.com/content/fulltext/?cid=85461]</ref> The installation of the red-light cameras has been one of White's most controversial acts as mayor.<ref>[http://www.theeagle.com/texas/Houston-traffic-cameras-debated http://www.theeagle.com/texas/Houston-traffic-cameras-debated]</ref> In 2007, he also launched the "Mobility Response Team", a task force staffed by traffic officers that patrol within [[Interstate 610 (Texas)|the loop]] fixing traffic problems. They also report traffic light outages, issue parking citations, help clear and direct traffic around minor accidents.<ref>[http://blogs.chron.com/cityhall/archives/2007/03/scooter_squadro_1.html http://blogs.chron.com/cityhall/archives/2007/03/scooter_squadro_1.html]</ref><ref>[http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-31818177_ITM http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-31818177_ITM]</ref>

===Third term===
Mayor White's third term began in January 2008 with his inauguration at the Discovery Green Park. 

White made fighting pollution in and around the Houston area a top concern during his third term.<ref>[http://www.cleanhouston.org/air/features/q&a_mayor.htm CleanHouston.org]</ref> He put pressure on local factories to limit pollution. He particularly emphasized reducing [[carcinogenic]] [[benzene]] emissions.<ref>[http://www.micromedex.com/pressroom/news_feeds/?story_ID=116858&category=5 http://www.micromedex.com/pressroom/news_feeds/?story_ID=116858&category=5]</ref> He forced Houston's largest refinery [[Lyondell Chemical Company]], located along the [[Houston Ship Channel]], to publicly defend its carcinogenic emissions.<ref>[http://www.istockanalyst.com/article/viewiStockNews/articleid/2661966 http://www.istockanalyst.com/article/viewiStockNews/articleid/2661966]</ref> This received criticism from some businesses claiming White overstepped his powers as mayor, however he has received great praise from the citizens of Houston. In thanks to his fighting of pollution in Houston, White was awarded the HERO Award (Houston-Galveston Environmental Research & Outreach Award) in September 15, 2008.<ref>[http://houston.bizjournals.com/houston/stories/2008/09/08/daily36.html bizjournals.com]</ref> In August 2008, White traveled to [[Stavanger, Norway]], one of Houston's [[sister cities]], for an energy conference.<ref>[http://blogs.chron.com/houstonpolitics/2008/08/wheres_white.html chron.com Where's White]</ref>
On June 9, 2008, White revealed plans to increase solar energy capacity for the city of Houston. Solar panels were installed on the Code Enforcement building and the roof of the City Hall Annex building. Houston was chosen as one of the U.S. cities in the [[Solar America Cities]] program designed increase the use of solar technology. The U.S. Department of Energy is providing assistance to the city in expanding its solar energy capacity.<ref>[http://www.houstontx.gov/mayor/press/20080609.html http://www.houstontx.gov/mayor/press/20080609.html]</ref>

White's third term will end on January 2, 2010. Due to term limits he will be unable to run again.

==US Senate Race==
 {{main|United States Senate election in Texas, 2012}}
There had been speculation that White might run for higher office.  On [[December 12]], [[2008]], it was announced that White had decided to run for the United States Senate seat currently held by Republican [[Kay Bailey Hutchison]], should she resign from her seat to challenge [[Governor of Texas|Governor]] [[Rick Perry]], as expected. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/chronicle/6162236.html|title=White eyes Hutchison's U.S. Senate seat|publisher=Houston Chronicle|accessdate=2008-12-16}}</ref> White has since created a [http://www.billwhitefortexas.com/home campaign website].

== Controversies ==
===SafeClear Program===
The [[SafeClear Program]], established during White's first term has been very controversial. The program requires stalled vehicles to be towed off of freeways in Houston as soon as possible. It was created to keep traffic down, as Houston has severe backups during the morning and evening [[rush hours]]. It was also meant to make the freeways safer by keeping them cleared of stalled vehicles. White encountered much opposition to the program when it was first implemented as it originally required motorists to pay for the towing of their stalled vehicle, but at reduced prices set by the city. This created opposition from both tow truck drivers and from motorists. However, this rule was later changed to allow free tows, for a limited distance, paid for by the city and with no regulation on the price that tow truck drivers can charge after the initial towing. The SafeClear program initially met with stiff opposition from towing companies that feared it would substantially affect their business.  More significantly, many citizens felt it was unfair to require a substantial tow fee when their vehicle became disabled on the freeways due to minor problems like a flat tire or running out of gas.  Several deaths on the Houston freeways were attributed to the SafeClear program.<ref>[http://www.khou.com/news/local/houstonmetro/stories/khou050201_cd_womanhit.658541ac.html http://www.khou.com/news/local/houstonmetro/stories/khou050201_cd_womanhit.658541ac.html]</ref><ref>[http://www.click2houston.com/news/4149837/detail.html http://www.click2houston.com/news/4149837/detail.html]</ref> When State Senator and fellow Democrat [[John Whitmire]] marshaled 30 out of 31 Texas State Senators' votes to make the SafeClear program illegal.<ref>[http://www.senate.state.tx.us/75r/Senate/archives/Arch05/w020305a.htm http://www.senate.state.tx.us/75r/Senate/archives/Arch05/w020305a.htm]</ref> White negotiated with him to address the objections of the senators, keeping the program alive but in a different format. The improvements to the program included strict licensing of SafeClear wreckers including criminal background checks, allowing the towed motorist to be towed for one mile for free, preventing the City leasing stretches of state-owned highway to private wrecker companies, and requiring revenue generated from the program to enter a mobility fund instead of general city coffers. <ref>http://www.lonestarreport.org/newsletters/2182005_Revivaloft.htm</ref> Studies, however, show that the program has been successful in decreasing accidents. A study, conducted one year after the implementation of the program by [[Rice University]] and [[Texas A&M University]] found that the number of freeway crashes decreased by 10.4%, decreasing by nearly 2,000 crashes.<ref>[http://www.kuhf.org/site/News2?JServSessionIdr008=2con2bpdo1.app5b&page=NewsArticle&id=15374&news_iv_ctrl=1521 http://www.kuhf.org/site/News2?JServSessionIdr008=2con2bpdo1.app5b&page=NewsArticle&id=15374&news_iv_ctrl=1521]</ref> According to these results, drivers in Houston saved approximately $35 million by the implementation of the program. However Suzanne Poole, president of the Houston Professional Towing Association, says those numbers are misleading saying "The price increase in gas and a lot of people are carpooling or using mass transit which those figures are reflected in how many people are using the buses. But also the wrecker drivers with the SafeClear program no longer call out officers to minor accidents, they simply give them the blue forms to send to the state. If they don't send those forms in, those accidents aren't reported. So the actual figures are inaccurate."<ref>[http://www.kuhf.org/site/News2?JServSessionIdr008=2con2bpdo1.app5b&page=NewsArticle&id=15374&news_iv_ctrl=1521 http://www.kuhf.org/site/News2?JServSessionIdr008=2con2bpdo1.app5b&page=NewsArticle&id=15374&news_iv_ctrl=1521]</ref> However, Suzanne Poole's claims are not necessarily correct. In reference to the program's objective to decrease traffic congestion, a study by [[KHOU-TV]] found that average drive times increased at 86% of freeways into Houston six months after the program was implemented compared to before the program.<ref>[http://www.bloghouston.net/item/5867 http://www.bloghouston.net/item/5867]</ref> However, some claim that more cars were on the roads during these six months and that construction on the freeways, particularly on [[Texas State Highway 59]], caused drive times to increase.

===Elena White's DWI===
In the summer of 2006, White's teenage daughter, Elena, was arrested on suspicion of driving while intoxicated. A [[Harris County, Texas|Harris County]] deputy constable arrested White about a mile from her home. Officials said that her Toyota Prius was pulled over because the headlights were off. Bill White said that he believed his daughter over the word of the police officer because she had never lied to her parents.  The Mayor's daughter was acquitted after jurors viewed video recordings of her sobriety tests.  One juror told the ''[[Houston Chronicle]]'' that, despite the officer's testimony, "it didn't seem like she was intoxicated."<ref>[http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/front/4535523.html Mayor White praises daughter acquitted of DWI | Chron.com - Houston Chronicle<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> In addition, the officer admitted to making several mistakes during administration of the tests.

===Red-light cameras===
At the recommendation of Houston Police Chief [[Harold Hurtt]], White had 50 [[Red light camera|red-light cameras]] installed around Houston's metropolitan area.<ref>[http://www.chron.com/mm/ymap/lightcams/ http://www.chron.com/mm/ymap/lightcams/]</ref> The red-light cameras caused a great deal of controversy, even leading to some lawsuits. Many people accused the city, claiming this was just for the city to make money and claiming that they actually increase accidents.<ref>[http://www.thetruthaboutcars.com/accidents-double-at-houston-red-light-camera-locations/ http://www.thetruthaboutcars.com/accidents-double-at-houston-red-light-camera-locations/]</ref> However, White has stood behind his decision to keep the red light cameras. An independent study by [[Texas A&M University]] found that they actually cut accidents by 30%.<ref>[http://www.kbtx.com/home/headlines/35497794.html http://www.kbtx.com/home/headlines/35497794.html]</ref><ref>[http://bigcountryhomepage.com/content/fulltext/?cid=85461 http://bigcountryhomepage.com/content/fulltext/?cid=85461]</ref> The study found that while rear-end collisions increased by 5%, right-angle collisions decreased by 43% and all other collisions went down by 30%.<ref>[http://www.kbtx.com/home/headlines/35497794.html http://www.kbtx.com/home/headlines/35497794.html]</ref> A study in Houston suburb [[Sugar Land]] found that the cameras reduced violations by 96 percent.<ref>[http://www.click2houston.com/news/15273145/detail.html Click2Houston.com "Local 2 Investigates Red-Light Camera Rumors"]</ref> Despite these studies, others say that they have actually increased accidents.<ref>[http://www.news8austin.com/content/your_news/default.asp?ArID=227958 http://www.news8austin.com/content/your_news/default.asp?ArID=227958]</ref> 

===Center for the Retarded===
In 2007, the City under Mayor White announced that it was planning to terminate the lease for The Center for the Retarded, which also housed the Lighthouse for the Blind. These facilities had served these special needs communities for over 43 years.  The facility was built on land that decades ago was considered worthless and had been leased for 99 years for $1, but had recently become very valuable. Several developers, who were large contributors to his campaigns, were interested in the project. White's rationale was that the property was worth $26 million to the public and in good faith the lease must be terminated. Though the Center had a 99-year lease, the City claimed under its Charter that it was unable to enter into such a long-term lease, thus it was not originally valid.<ref>[http://www.bloghouston.net/item/5067 http://www.bloghouston.net/item/5067]</ref> After a great public hue and outcry, White realized that sacrificing handicapped people's housing and jobs to make a few people richer would not be tolerated by the populace of Houston. This led to great public backlash in Houston<ref>[http://www.kuhf.org/site/News2?JServSessionIdr006=3mfros1hy1.app7b&page=NewsArticle&id=19944&news_iv_ctrl=1902 http://www.kuhf.org/site/News2?JServSessionIdr006=3mfros1hy1.app7b&page=NewsArticle&id=19944&news_iv_ctrl=1902]</ref> and the public raised $6 million to pay the City and discussions about closing the facility ended.<ref>[http://www.savethecenter.org/en/art/?34 http://www.savethecenter.org/en/art/?34]</ref>




When Bill White first ran for mayor in 2003, a scandal embroiled his campaign. A woman claimed that another candidate had paid her to find another person named "Bill White" to run in the campaign to confuse the voters.  The convoluted story ended with Bill White inexplicably writing her a $5,000 check "because she was scared" of what would happen.  The whole debacle could be seen as an attempt to pay a person to concoct a seemingly-false story incriminating another candidate. There was never a good answer to the question of what exactly occurred, but it smelled of dirty politics. <ref>http://www.houstonpress.com/2003-10-09/news/in-search-of-bogus-bill/</ref>

On October 1, 2006, Houston City Council, at the urging of Mayor White, amended Chpt. 19-43 of the code regarding floodway and floodplain properties.  The change removed a previous exception for building in floodways that allowed owners to build provided they could prove with an engineering study that the building would not increase flooding.  As a result of this change, those with vacant land saw their property become worthless as it was unusable.  Those with existing structures also saw a dramatic loss in property value because there was a provision disqualifying rebuilding if the property was sufficiently damaged.  There are several law suits pending regarding this ordinance.  The main argument is that this law was an unconstitutional regulatory taking of property that would normally have required the use of eminent domain.  A group called the Floodway Coalition of Houston has organized to lobby for repeal of the change.  Mayor White has consistently backed the change in the ordinance.
