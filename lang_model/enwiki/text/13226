'''''Acer sempervirens''''' ('''Cretan Maple''') is a species of [[maple]] native to southeastern [[Europe]] and southwestern [[Asia]], in southern [[Greece]] and southern [[Turkey]].<ref name=mc>Med-Checklist: [http://ww2.bgbm.org/mcl/PTaxonDetail.asp?NameId=1007&PTRefFK=1273 ''Acer sempervirens'']</ref><ref name=rushforth>Rushforth, K. (1999). ''Trees of Britain and Europe''. Collins ISBN 0-00-220013-9.</ref>

It is an [[evergreen]] or semi-evergreen [[shrub]] or small [[tree]] growing to 10 m tall with a trunk up to 50 cm diameter. The [[bark]] is dark grey, smooth in young trees, becoming scaly and shallowly fissured in mature trees. The shoots are green at first, becoming dull brown in the second year. The [[leaf|leaves]] are opposite, hard and leathery in texture, 1-4 cm long and 1-3 cm across, glossy dark green with a yellow 1 cm petiole, variably unlobed or three-lobed (often on the same shoot); the lobes have an entire margin. The [[flower]]s are yellow-green, produced in small pendulous [[corymb]]s. The [[fruit]] is a double [[Samara (fruit)|samara]] with two rounded, winged [[seed]]s, the wings 1.5<U+2013>3 cm long, spread at an acute angle.<ref name=rushforth/><ref name=afm2>Mitchell, A. F.

It is one of the most drought and heat tolerant species in the genus, occurring on dry, sunny hillsides at moderate elevations. It is closely related to ''[[Acer monspessulanum]]'' from further north and west in Europe, differing from it in being a smaller, often shrubby tree, and in its smaller, evergreen leaves.<ref name=rushforth/>

===Cultivation and uses===
Cretan Maple is occasionally grown as an [[ornamental tree]] in western Europe; it was introduced to Britain in 1752.<ref name=afm2/>
