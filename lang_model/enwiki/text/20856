The '''River Brue''' originates in the parish of [[Brewham]] in [[Somerset]], [[England]], and reaches the sea some 50&nbsp;km west at [[Burnham-on-Sea]]. It originally took a different route from [[Glastonbury]] to the sea, but this was changed by the monastery in the twelfth century.

==Course==
The River Brue originates in the same hills as [[King Alfred's Tower]] and the sources of the [[River Wylye]] and the [[River Stour, Dorset|Dorset Stour]].<ref>{{cite book | last =Lewis | first =Samuel (the younger) | title =The Book of English Rivers | publisher =Longman, Brown, Green, and Longmans | date = 1855 | location = London| pages = 50<U+2013>51| url =http://books.google.com/books?id=BUNTxplv8Y0C&pg=PA50 }}</ref> It falls quickly in a narrow valley to a point just beyond [[Bruton]] where it is joined by the River Pitt. Here is takes a meandering route through a broad, flat-bottomed valley between [[Castle Cary]] and [[Alhampton]]. By the time it reaches [[Baltonsborough]] it is only some 10m above sea level and the surrounding countryside is drained into it by way of numerous [[rhyne]]s. It passes [[Glastonbury]] before flowing in a largely artificial channel across the [[Somerset Levels]] and into the [[Bristol Channel]] at [[Highbridge, Somerset|Highbridge]]. It is joined by the North Drain, White's River (which takes the water of the [[River Sheppey]], Cripps River (an artificial channel that connects it to the [[River Huntspill]]) and many drainage rhynes. It is tidal below the sluices at New Clyce Bridge in Highbridge.<ref name=os>{{cite map |publisher =Ordnance Survey |title =Explorer 153, 141, 142 |url = http://getamap.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/getamap/frames.htm?mapAction=gaz&gazName=g&gazString=ST667336|accessdate = 2008-11-04}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.somerset.gov.uk/somerset/cultureheritage/heritage/info/somersetlandscape/somersettopographyrivers1.cfm|title=Somerset Topography: Rivers|publisher=Somerset County Council|accessdate=2008-11-07}}</ref> 

The River Brue has a long history of flooding. Its lower reaches are close to sea-level, and the river above Bruton drains an area of 31&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> into a steep and narrow valley. In 1768 the river rose very rapidly and destroyed a stone bridge in Bruton. In 1984 a protective dam was built 1&nbsp;km upstream from the town.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.waterpowermagazine.com/storyprint.asp?sc=2025430|title=Real-time flood forecasting|last= Clark|first=Colin|date=2004|work=International Water Power and Dam Construction website|publisher=Progressive Media Markets Ltd|accessdate=2008-11-06}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Singh|first=Vijay P. |title=Watershed Hydrology: Proceedings of the International Conference on Water and Environment|publisher=Allied Publishers|location=Bhopal, India|date=December 15-18, 2003|pages=426, 485<U+2013>488|isbn=9788177645477|url=http://books.google.ca/books?id=73DdflwDU0oC&pg=PA485}}</ref>

The valley includes several [[Site of Special Scientific Interest|Sites of Special Scientific Interest]] including [[Westhay Moor]].

==History==
===Pomparles Bridge===
[[Image:Tootal bridge.jpg|thumb|Tootal Bridge at [[Barton St David]] over the River Brue]]
At the time of [[King Arthur]] the Brue formed a lake just south of the hilly ground on which Glastonbury stands.  This lake is one of the locations suggested by [[Arthurian legend]] as the home of the [[Lady of the Lake]]. Pomparles Bridge stood at the western end of this lake, guarding Glastonbury from the south, and it is suggested that it was here that [[Bedivere|Sir Bedivere]] threw [[Excalibur]] into the waters after King Arthur fell at the [[Battle of Camlann]].<ref>{{cite web | title=Pomparles Bridge | work=ArthurianAdventure.com | url=http://www.arthurianadventure.com/pomparles_bridge.htm | accessdate=2008-11-01}}</ref>

[[John Leland (antiquary)|John Leland]] noted in the 16th century that the bridge had four arches, while W.Phelps in an 1839 illustration as having only two arches, one pointed, probably C14-15, and the other round. Excavations in 1912 found the remains of a second round arch regarded as C12 work. The current concrete arch bridge was built in 1911 and extended in 1972.<ref>{{cite web | title=Pomparles Bridge, Northover, Glastonbury | work=Somerset Historic Environment Record | url=http://webapp1.somerset.gov.uk/her/details.asp?prn=23577 | accessdate=2008-11-01}}</ref> It carries the [[A39 road]] over the Brue.

===Alteration of route===
Prior to the 13th century the direct route to the sea at Highbridge was prevented by gravel banks and peat near Westhay.<ref>{{cite web | title=Meare and Ferran Mere | work=Sacred Sites
around Glastonbury | url=http://www.isleofavalon.co.uk/sacredsites/meare.html | accessdate=2008-11-01}}</ref> The course of the river partially encircled [[Glastonbury]] from the south, around the western side (through [[Beckery]]),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.somerset.gov.uk/media/1B237/EUS_GlastonburyMapB.pdf|title=Glastonbury Map B - Dark Age/Saxon|date=2003|publisher=Somerset County Council|accessdate=2008-11-07}}</ref> and then north through the [[Panborough]]-[[Bleadney]] gap in the [[Wedmore]]-[[Wookey]] Hills, to join the [[River Axe, Somerset|River Axe]] just north of Bleadney. This route made it difficult for the officials of [[Glastonbury Abbey]] to transport produce from their outlying estates to the Abbey, and when the valley of the river Axe was in flood it backed up to flood Glastonbury itself. Sometime between 1230 and 1250 a new channel was constructed westwards into [[Meare Pool]] north of [[Meare]], and further westwards to [[Mark Moor]]. It then divided into two channels, one the [[Pilrow]] cut flowing north through [[Mark, Somerset|Mark]] to join the Axe near [[Edingworth]], and the other directly west to the sea at [[Highbridge, Somerset|Highbridge]].<ref name="havinden">{{cite book|last=Havinden|first=Michael|title=The Somerset Landscape|publisher=Hodder and Stoughton|location=London|series=The making of the English landscape|pages=110<U+2013>111|isbn=0340201169|year=1981}}</ref>

===Drainage improvements===
Between 1774 and 1797 a series of [[Inclosure Acts|enclosures]] took place in the Brue valley between the [[Polden Hills|Poldens]]  and [[Wedmore]].<ref name="havinden">{{cite book|last=Havinden|first=Michael|title=The Somerset Landscape|year=1982|publisher=Hodder and Stoughton|location=London|series=The making of the English landscape|pages=135<U+2013>136|isbn=0340201169}}</ref> In 1794 the annual floods filled the whole of the Brue valley. Work by the Commissioners of Sewers led to the 1801 Brue Drainage Act which enabled sections at Highbridge and Cripp's Bridge to be straightened, and new feeder channels such as the North and South Drains to be constructed.<ref name=gc>{{cite book | title=The Glastonbury Canal | first= Geoffrey | last= Body |coauthors = Roy Gallop | isbn= 0946217084 | year= 2001 | publisher=Fiducia Press | location=Bristol }}</ref> In 1803 the [[Sluice|clyse]] at Highbridge, which had been built before 1485, was replaced and moved further downstream.<ref name="havinden">{{cite book|last=Havinden|first=Michael|title=The Somerset Landscape|year=1982|publisher=Hodder and Stoughton|location=London|series=The making of the English landscape|pages=149<U+2013>150|isbn=0340201169}}</ref>

===Canals===
Both [[Galton's Canal]] and Brown's Canal once connected to the river.<ref name=canalswenglandp190-191>{{cite book | title=The Canals of South West England | first= Charles | last= Hadfield | pages= 190<U+2013>191 | isbn= 0715341766 | year= 1967 | month= November | publisher=David & Charles | location=Newton Abbot (Devon)}}</ref> The [[Glastonbury Canal]] used the course of the River Brue from Highbridge to Cripp's Bridge, and part of the South Drain to Ashcott Corner.<ref name=gc/>

===Second World War===
During the [[Second World War]] the Brue was incorporated into [[GHQ Line]] and many [[British hardened field defences of World War II|pillboxes]] were constructed along the river.<ref>*{{cite book

==Economy==
[[Gants Mill]] at [[Pitcombe]], near [[Bruton]], is a [[watermill]] which is still used to mill cattle feed. A 12&nbsp;kW [[hydroelectric]] turbine was recently installed at the site. There has been a mill here since the 13th century, but the current building was built in 1810.

During monastic times, there were several [[Fishing weir|fish weirs]] along the lower reaches of the river. They used either nets or baskets, the fishing rights belonging to the [[Bishop of Bath and Wells]] and the [[Glastonbury Abbey|Abbot of Glastonbury]].<ref>{{cite web| url=http://archaeologydataservice.ac.uk/catalogue/adsdata/arch-769-1/ ahds/dissemination/pdf/vol48/48_091_130.pdf|title=Making the Most of a Bad Situation?
