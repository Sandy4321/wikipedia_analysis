'''C<U+00E9>sar Ch<U+00E1>vez Estrada''' ({{IPA-es|<U+02C8>sesar <U+02C8>t<U+0283>a<U+03B2>ez}}; March 31, 1927&nbsp;<U+2013> April 23, 1993) was a [[Mexican American]] farm worker, [[labor leader]], and [[civil rights]] activist who, with [[Dolores Huerta]], co-founded the [[National Farm Workers Association]], which later became the [[United Farm Workers]] (UFW).<ref name="points">[http://www.extramile.us/honorees/chavez.cfm The Extra Mile - Points of Light Volunteer Pathway<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> 

He became the best known Latino civil rights activist and as, founder of the United Farm Workers ('''UFW''') was strongly promoted by the labor movement eager to enroll Hispanic members . His public-relations approach to unionism and aggressive but nonviolent tactics made the farm workers' struggle a moral cause with nationwide support. By the late 1970s, his tactics had forced growers to recognize the UFW as the bargaining agent for 50,000 field workers in California and Florida. However by the mid-1980s membership in the UFW had dwindled to around 15,000.  

Chavez was charismatic; a self-taught rhetorical genius he created commitment by inspiring well educated Latino idealists with undiscovered organizing potential and encouraged them to offer a liberating, self-abnegating devotion to the farmworkers' movement.  Claiming as his models [[Emiliano Zapata]], [[Gandhi]], [[Nehru]] and [[Martin Luther King]], he called on his people to, "Make a solemn promise: to enjoy our rightful part of the riches of this land, to throw off the yoke of being considered as agricultural implements or slaves. We are free men and we demand justice."

After his death he became a major historical icon for the Latino community, and for liberals generally, symbolizing militant support for workers and for Hispanic power based on grass roots organizing and his slogan "S<U+00ED>, se puede" ([[Spanish language|Spanish]] for "Yes, it is possible" or, roughly, "Yes, it can be done").

Supporters say his work led to numerous improvements for union laborers. His birthday has become '''C<U+00E9>sar Ch<U+00E1>vez Day''', a state holiday in eight [[US states]].  Many parks, cultural centers, libraries, schools, and streets have been named in his honor in cities across the United States.
==Career==
Chavez was born on March 31, 1927, in the North Gila Valley near Yuma, Arizona.  By 1938 the Great Depression had driven the Chavez family off its small farm and they became migrant farm workers in California. Chavez attended numerous schools but never finished the eighth grade. 
==Activism==
Chavez worked in the fields until 1952, when he became an organizer for the [[Community Service Organization]] ('''CSO'''), a Latino civil rights group.  He was hired and trained by [[Fred Ross]] as an organizer targeting police brutality. Ch<U+00E1>vez urged Mexican Americans to register and vote, and he traveled throughout California and made speeches in support of [[Labor rights|workers' rights]]. He later became CSO's national director in 1958.<ref>http://www.dol.gov/oasam/programs/laborhall/1998_chavez.htm</ref>

In 1962 Ch<U+00E1>vez left the CSO and co-founded the [[National Farm Workers Association]] (NFWA) with [[Dolores Huerta]]. It was later called the [[United Farm Workers]] (UFW).

[[File:Cesar chavez2.jpg|Ch<U+00E1>vez speaking at a 1974 [[United Farm Workers]] rally in [[Delano, California]]|thumb|left]]
When [[Filipino American]] farm workers initiated the [[Delano grape strike]] on September 8, 1965, to protest for higher wages, Ch<U+00E1>vez eagerly supported them. Six months later, Ch<U+00E1>vez and the NFWA led a strike of California grape pickers on the historic farmworkers march from Delano to the California state capitol in [[Sacramento, California|Sacramento]] for similar goals. The UFW encouraged all Americans to boycott table grapes as a show of support. The strike lasted five years and attracted national attention. In March 1966, the [[United States Senate Committee on Labor and Public Welfare|US Senate Committee on Labor and Public Welfare's]] Subcommittee on Migratory Labor held hearings in California on the strike. During the hearings, subcommittee member [[Robert F. Kennedy]] expressed his support for the striking workers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/rfk/peopleevents/p_chavez.html|title=People & Events: Cesar Chavez (1927-1993) |date=2004-07-01|work=American Experience, RFK|publisher=Public Broadcasting System|accessdate=2009-03-31}}</ref>

These activities led to similar movements in Southern Texas in 1966, where the UFW supported fruit workers in Starr County, Texas, and led a march to [[Austin, Texas|Austin]], in support of UFW farm workers' rights. In the [[Midwest United States|Midwest]], C<U+00E9>sar Ch<U+00E1>vez's movement inspired the founding of two Midwestern independent unions: [[Obreros Unidos]] in Wisconsin in 1966, and the [[Farm Labor Organizing Committee]] (FLOC) in Ohio in 1967. Former UFW organizers would also found the Texas Farm Workers Union in 1975.

In the early 1970s, the UFW organized strikes and boycotts to protest for, and later win, higher wages for those farm workers who were working for grape and lettuce growers. The union also won passage of the [[California Agricultural Labor Relations Act]], which gave collective bargaining rights to farm workers. During the 1980s, Ch<U+00E1>vez led a boycott to protest the use of toxic pesticides on grapes. Bumper stickers reading "NO GRAPES" and "UVAS NO"<ref>[http://www.ufwstore.com/mm5/merchant.mvc?Screen=PROD&Store_Code=IS0005&Product_Code=CB02&Category_Code=BTNS] Original UFW Button</ref> (the translation in [[Spanish language|Spanish]]) were widespread. He again fasted to draw public attention. UFW organizers believed that a reduction in produce sales by 15% was sufficient to wipe out the profit margin of the boycotted product. These strikes and boycotts generally ended with the signing of bargaining agreements.{{Clarify|date=March 2009}}

==Immigration==
The UFW during Ch<U+00E1>vez's tenure was committed to restricting immigration. C<U+00E9>sar Ch<U+00E1>vez and Dolores Huerta fought the [[Bracero Program]] that existed from 1942 to 1964. Their opposition stemmed from their belief that the program undermined US workers and exploited the migrant workers. Since the Bracero program ensured a constant supply of cheap immigrant labor for growers, immigrants could not protest any infringement of their rights, lest they be fired and replaced.  Their efforts contributed to Congress ending the [[Bracero Program]] in 1964. In 1973, the UFW was one of the first labor unions to oppose proposed employer sanctions that would have prohibited hiring undocumented immigrants. Later during the 1980s, while Ch<U+00E1>vez was still working alongside UFW president, Dolores Huerta, the cofounder of the UFW, was key in getting the amnesty provisions into the [[Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986|1986 federal immigration act]].<ref>[http://www.ufw.org/_page.php?menu=creating&inc=legislation/agjobs/debunk.htm] Debunking falsehoods about the UFW<U+2019>s stand on immigration</ref>

On a few occasions, concerns that undocumented migrant labor would undermine UFW strike campaigns led to a number of controversial events, which the UFW describes as anti-strikebreaking events, but which have also been interpreted as being anti-immigrant. In 1969, Ch<U+00E1>vez and members of the UFW marched through the [[Imperial Valley (California)|Imperial]] and [[Coachella Valley]]s to the border of Mexico to protest growers' use of undocumented immigrants as strikebreakers. Joining him on the march were both Reverend [[Ralph Abernathy]] and US Senator [[Walter Mondale]].<ref>[http://boxer.senate.gov/chavez/timeline.cfm] Official Website of Barbara Boxer "C<U+00E9>sar Ch<U+00E1>vez Day Timeline"</ref> In its early years, Ch<U+00E1>vez and the UFW went so far as to report undocumented immigrants who served as strikebreaking replacement workers, as well as those who refused to unionize, to the [[Immigration and Naturalization Service]].<ref>[http://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0520202198&id=HAd4W9OdLX0C&pg=PA197&lpg=PA197&ots=X9eCyCQtaq&dq=UFW+report+undocumented&sig=I-BkkeqB84_UYgjh2Fs1affaln0#PPA197,M1] Walls and Mirrors: Mexican Americans, Mexican Immigrants and the Politics of Ethnicity By David Gregory Guti<U+00E9>rrez at p.197-98</ref><ref>[http://www.aim.org/media_monitor/A402_0_2_0_C/] Accuracy in the Media "Why Journalists Support Illegal Immigration" By Reed Irvine and Cliff Kincaid</ref><ref>[http://books.google.com/books?id=ewnEO2GvkFIC&pg=PA89&ots=3bsbckEtw7&dq=ufw+undocumented&sig=5j3oluULLZo4AfXwTVqrmvMhyAQ#PPA90,M1] Strawberry Fields: politics, class, and work in California agriculture By Miriam J.

In 1973, the United Farm Workers set up a "wet line" along the [[United States-Mexico border]] to prevent Mexican immigrants from entering the United States illegally and potentially undermining the UFW's unionization efforts.<ref>[http://migration.ucdavis.edu/rmn/more.php?id=217_0_3_0]

==Education==
Later in life, Ch<U+00E1>vez focused on his education. The walls of his office in [[Keene, California]] (United Farm Worker headquarters) were lined with hundreds of books ranging in subject from philosophy, [[economics]], [[cooperative]]s, and unions, to biographies of [[Gandhi]] and the [[Kennedys]]. He was a [[Veganism|vegan]].<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.theecologist.org/green_green_living/food_and_drink/271795/can_you_read_this_and_not_become_a_vegan.html | title = Can you read this and not become a vegan? | author = Sophie Morris | publisher=''[[The Ecologist]]'' | date=2009-06-19 | accessdate=2010-04-09}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.masbakersfield.com/node/2089 | title = Vegetarians add some cultural flare to meals | publisher=M<U+00E1>s Magazine | date=2006-01-04 | accessdate=2010-04-09}}</ref>

==C<U+00E9>sar Ch<U+00E1>vez Day==
[[File:Cesar Chavez Day.jpg|thumb|Cesar Chavez Day poster]]
C<U+00E9>sar Ch<U+00E1>vez's birthday, March 31, is celebrated in California as a state holiday, intended to promote service to the community in honor of Ch<U+00E1>vez's life and work. Many, but not all, state government offices, community colleges, and libraries are closed, only two public school districts in San Jose observe the day with no school. Texas also recognizes the day, and it is an optional holiday in Arizona and Colorado.

In 1973, college professors in [[Mount Angel, Oregon]] established the first four-year Mexican-American college in the United States. They chose C<U+00E9>sar Ch<U+00E1>vez as their symbolic figurehead, naming the college [[Colegio Cesar Chavez]]. In the book ''[[Colegio Cesar Chavez, 1973-1983: A Chicano Struggle for Educational Self-Determination]]'' author Carlos Maldonado writes that Ch<U+00E1>vez visited the campus twice, joining in public demonstrations in support of the college. Though Colegio Cesar Chavez closed in 1983, it remains a recognized part of Oregon history. On its website the [[Oregon Historical Society]] writes, "Structured as a 'college-without-walls,' more than 100 students took classes in Chicano Studies, early childhood development, and adult education. Significant financial and administrative problems caused Colegio to close in 1983. Its history represents the success of a grassroots movement."<ref>[http://www.ohs.org/education/Our-Ways-Exhibit-2.cfm Oregon Historical Society] "Colegio C<U+00E9>sar Ch<U+00E1>vez was established in 1973 on the site of the former Mt. Angel College and was the only degree-granting institution for Latinos in the nation. Structured as a "college-without-walls," more than 100 students took classes in Chicano studies, early childhood development, and adult education. Significant financial and administrative problems caused Colegio to close in 1983. Its history represents the success of a grassroots movement." Retrieved March 10, 2007</ref> The Colegio has been described as having been a symbol of the Latino presence in Oregon.<ref>[http://news.opb.org/article/5340-what-cesar-chavezs-connection-oregon/ What Is Cesar Chavez's Connection To Oregon?]</ref>

In 1992 Ch<U+00E1>vez was awarded the [[Pacem in Terris Award]]. It was named after a 1963 [[encyclical]] letter by [[Pope John XXIII]] that calls upon all people of good will to secure peace among all nations. [[Pacem in Terris]] is [[Latin]] for "Peace on Earth."

C<U+00E9>sar Ch<U+00E1>vez died on April 23, 1993, of unspecified natural causes in a rental apartment in [[San Luis, Arizona]]. Shortly after his death, his widow, Helen Ch<U+00E1>vez, donated his black nylon union jacket to the [[National Museum of American History]], a branch of the [[Smithsonian]].<ref name="NMAH">{{cite web|url=http://americanhistory.si.edu/collections/object.cfm?key=35&objkey=104|title=Cesar Ch<U+00E1>vez 's Union Jacket|publisher=National Museum of American History, Smithsonian Institution|accessdate=2008-07-07}}</ref>

On September 8, 1994, C<U+00E9>sar Ch<U+00E1>vez was presented, posthumously, with the [[Presidential Medal of Freedom]] by President [[William Clinton]]. The award was received by his widow, Helen Ch<U+00E1>vez.

The California cities of [[Long Beach, California|Long Beach]], Modesto, Sacramento, [[San Diego, California|San Diego]], [[Berkeley, California|Berkeley]], and [[San Jose, California]] have renamed parks after him, as well as the City of [[Seattle, Washington|Seattle]], Washington.
