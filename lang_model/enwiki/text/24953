The Atomiswave is [[Sammy Corporation]]'s 2003 custom [[arcade system board]] and [[arcade cabinet|cabinet]], which is based on Sega's [[Sega NAOMI|NAOMI]] system board (Thus it's often common to see the "Sega" logo on its boot up screen). The Atomiswave system board uses interchangeable game cartridges, and the cabinet's control panel can be easily switched out with different control sets, including dual joysticks, dual lightguns, and a steering wheel.

With the retirement of the aging [[Neo Geo (console)|NeoGeo MVS]] system, [[SNK Playmore]] chose the Atomiswave as its next system to develop games for. In a contract with [[Sammy]], SNK Playmore agreed to develop five games for the Atomiswave system. [[Metal Slug 6]] was SNK Playmore's fifth game for the Atomiswave, after which SNK moved on to a [[Taito Type X|Taito Type X2]] arcade board.
