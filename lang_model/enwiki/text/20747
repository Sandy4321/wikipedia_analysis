<!--Para1: Definition and characterization-->
'''Schizophrenia''' is a psychiatric [[diagnosis]] that describes a [[mental disorder]] characterized by impairments in the [[perception]] or expression of [[reality]] and by significant social or occupational dysfunction. A person experiencing untreated schizophrenia is typically characterized as demonstrating disorganized [[thought|thinking]], and as experiencing [[delusion]]s or auditory [[hallucination]]s. Although the disorder is primarily thought to affect [[cognition]], it can also contribute to chronic problems with [[human behavior|behavior]] and [[emotion]]. Due to the many possible combinations of symptoms, there is ongoing and heated debate about whether the diagnosis necessarily or adequately describes a disorder, or alternatively whether it might represent a number of disorders. For this reason, [[Eugen Bleuler]] deliberately called the disease "the schizophrenias" plural, when he coined the present name.

<!--Para2: Diagnosis and suspected causes-->
[[Diagnosis]] is based on the self-reported experiences of the patient, in combination with secondary signs observed by a [[psychiatrist]], [[clinical psychologist]] or other competent clinician. There is no objective [[biology|biological]] test for schizophrenia, though studies suggest that [[genetics]], [[neurobiology]] and social environment are important contributing factors. Current research into the development of the disorder often focuses on the role of neurobiology, although a reliable and identifiable organic cause has not been found. In the absence of objective laboratory tests to confirm the diagnosis, some question the [[legitimacy]] of schizophrenia's status as a [[disease]]. Furthermore, some question the status of schizophrenia as a disease on the basis that they do not consider their condition to be an impairment. 

<!--Para3: Tricky etymology and misconceptions-->
The term ''schizophrenia'' translates roughly as "shattered mind," and comes from the [[Greek language|Greek]] <U+03C3><U+03C7><U+03AF><U+03B6><U+03C9> (''schizo'', "to split" or "to divide") and <U+03C6><U+03C1><U+03AE><U+03BD> (''phr<U+0113>n'', "[[mind]]"). Despite its etymology, schizophrenia is not synonymous with [[dissociative identity disorder]], also known as multiple personality disorder or "split personality"; in [[popular culture]] the two are often confused. Although schizophrenia often leads to social or occupational [[dysfunction]], there is little association of the illness with a predisposition toward aggressive behavior.

<!--Para4: Comorbidity-->
Patients diagnosed with schizophrenia are highly likely to be diagnosed with other disorders. The lifetime [[prevalence]] of [[substance abuse]] is typically around 40%. [[Comorbidity]] is also high with [[clinical depression]], [[anxiety disorders]], social problems, and a generally decreased [[life expectancy]] is also present. Patients diagnosed with schizophrenia typically live 10-12 years less than their healthy counterparts, owing to increased physical health problems and a high [[suicide]] rate.

==Overview==
Schizophrenia is often described in terms of "positive" and "negative" symptoms. ''Positive symptoms'' include [[delusion]]s, [[hallucination|auditory hallucinations]] and [[thought disorder]] and are typically regarded as manifestations of [[psychosis]]. ''Negative symptoms'' are so named because they are considered to be the loss or absence of normal traits or abilities, and include features such as flat, blunted or constricted [[Affect (psychology)|affect]] and [[emotion]], poverty of [[speech]] and lack of [[motivation]]. Some models of schizophrenia include [[formal thought disorder]] and planning difficulties in a third group, a "disorganization syndrome."

Additionally, [[neurocognitive deficit]]s may be present. These may take the form of reduced or impaired psychological functions such as [[memory]], [[attention]], [[problem solving|problem-solving]], [[executive function]] or [[social cognition]].

Onset of schizophrenia typically occurs in late adolescence or early adulthood, with males tending to show symptoms earlier than females.

In 1893 [[Psychiatry|Psychiatrist]] [[Emil Kraepelin]] was the first to draw a distinction between what he termed [[dementia praecox]] ("premature dementia") and other psychotic illnesses. In 1908, ''"dementia praecox"'' was renamed "schizophrenia" by psychiatrist [[Eugen Bleuler]], who found Kraepelin's term to be misleading, as the disorder is not a form of [[dementia]], premature or otherwise. 

The diagnostic category of schizophrenia has been widely criticised as lacking in scientific validity or reliability, consistent with evidence of poor levels of consistency in diagnostic practices and the use of criteria. One alternative suggests that the problems and issues making up the diagnosis of schizophrenia would be better addressed as individual dimensions along which everyone varies, such that there is a spectrum or continuum rather than a cut-off between normal and ill. This approach appears consistent with research on [[schizotypy]] and of a relatively high prevalence of psychotic experiences and delusional beliefs amongst the general public. 

The wider [[anti-psychiatry]] movement also often argues against the diagnosis, for example arguing that classifying unusual thoughts, feelings and behaviors as a medical illness in this way is unscientific, stigmatizing, and legitimises the [[social control]] of people whom [[society]] finds undesirable but who have committed no crime. 

Although no common cause of schizophrenia has been identified in all individuals diagnosed with the condition, currently most researchers and clinicians believe it results from a combination of both [[human brain|brain]] vulnerabilities (either inherited or acquired) and stressful life-events. This widely-adopted approach is known as the 'stress-vulnerability' model, and much scientific debate now focuses on how much each of these factors contributes to the development and maintenance of schizophrenia.

It is also thought that processes in early [[neurodevelopment]] are important, particularly [[prenatal]] processes. In adult life, particular importance has been placed upon the function (or malfunction) of [[dopamine]] in the [[mesolimbic pathway]] in the brain. This theory, known as the [[dopamine hypothesis of schizophrenia]] largely resulted from the accidental finding that a [[Medication|drug]] group which blocks dopamine function, known as the [[phenothiazine]]s, reduced psychotic symptoms. However, this theory is now thought to be overly simplistic as a complete explanation. These drugs have now been developed further and [[antipsychotic]] [[medication]] is commonly used as a first-line treatment. Although effective in many cases, these medications are not well tolerated by many patients due to significant [[adverse drug reaction|side-effects]], and have little effect on some individuals.

Differences in brain structure have been found between people with schizophrenia and those without. However, these tend only to be reliable on the group level and, due to the significant variability between individuals, may not be reliably present in any particular individual.

==History==
Accounts that may relate to symptoms of schizophrenia date back as far as 2000 BC in the ''Book of Hearts'', part of the ancient [[Ebers papyrus]]. However, a recent study{{Fn|1}} into the [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greek]] and [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] literature showed that, while the general population probably had an awareness of psychotic disorders, there was no recorded condition that would meet the modern diagnostic criteria for schizophrenia in these societies.

This nonspecific concept of "[[Insanity|madness]]" has been around for many thousands of years, but schizophrenia was only classified as a distinct mental disorder by Kraepelin in 1887. He was the first to make a distinction in the psychotic disorders between what he called ''dementia praecox'' (a term first used by psychiatrist [[Benedict A. Morel]]) and [[manic depression]]. Kraepelin believed that dementia praecox was primarily a disease of the brain{{Fn|2}}, and particularly a form of [[dementia]]. Kraepelin named the disorder 'dementia praecox' (early dementia) to distinguish it from other forms of dementia (such as [[Alzheimer's disease]]) which typically occur late in life. He used this term because his studies focused on young adults with dementia.{{Fn|49}}

The term ''schizophrenia'' is derived from the Greek words 'schizo' (split) and 'phren' (mind) and was coined by [[Eugene Bleuler]] in 1908 to refer to the lack of interaction between thought processes and [[perception]]. He was also the first to describe the symptoms as "positive" or "negative."{{Fn|2}} Blueler described the main symptoms as 4 "A"'s: flattened Affect, Autism, impaired Association of ideas and Ambivalence. {{Fn|78}} Bleuler suggested the name schizophrenia, as it was obvious that Kraepelin's name was misleading. The word "praecox" implied precocious or early onset, hence premature dementia, as opposed to [[senility|senile dementia]] from old age. Bleuler realized the illness was not a dementia, as it did not lead to mental deterioration and could occur early or late in life. Rather, schizophrenia led to a sharpening of the senses and a greater awareness of memories and experiences.

With the name 'schizophrenia' Bleuler intended to capture the separation of function between [[personality]], [[thought|thinking]], [[memory]], and [[perception]], however it is commonly misunderstood to mean that affected persons have a 'split personality' (something akin to the character in [[Robert Louis Stevenson|Robert Louis Stevenson's]] ''[[The Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde]]''). Although some people diagnosed with schizophrenia may hear voices and may experience the voices as distinct personalities, schizophrenia does not involve a person changing among distinct multiple personalities. The confusion perhaps arises in part due to the meaning of Bleuler's term 'schizophrenia' (literally 'split mind'). Interestingly, the first known misuse of this word schizophrenia to mean 'split personality' (in the [[Jekyll and Hyde]] sense) was in an article by the poet [[T. S. Eliot]] in 1933.{{Fn|3}}

In the first half of the [[twentieth century]] schizophrenia was considered by many to be a "hereditary defect", and individuals affected by schizophrenia became subject to [[eugenics]] in many countries. Hundreds of thousands were [[Sterilization (surgical procedure)|sterilized]], with or without consent, the majority in [[Nazi Germany]], the [[United States]], and [[Scandinavia|Scandinavian]] countries.{{Fn|76}},{{Fn|77}} Many people diagnosed with schizophrenia, together with other people labeled "mentally unfit", were murdered in the Nazi "[[Operation T-4]]" program.

==Diagnosis==
===Criteria (signs and symptoms) ===
Like many mental illnesses, the diagnosis of schizophrenia is based upon the behavior of the person being assessed. There is a list of criteria that must be met for someone to be so diagnosed. These depend on both the presence and duration of certain signs and symptoms.

The most commonly used criteria for diagnosing schizophrenia are from the [[American Psychiatric Association|American Psychiatric Association's]] [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]] (DSM) and the [[World Health Organization|World Health Organization's]] [[ICD|International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems]] (ICD). The most recent versions are [http://www.who.int/whosis/icd10/ ICD-10] and [http://www.psych.org/research/dor/dsm/index.cfm DSM-IV-TR].

Below is an abbreviated version of the diagnostic criteria from the DSM-IV-TR; the full version is available [http://www.behavenet.com/capsules/disorders/schiz.htm here].

To be diagnosed as having schizophrenia, a person must display:

*A) Characteristic symptoms: Two or more of the following, each present for a significant portion of time during a one-month period (or less, if successfully treated)
** [[delusion]]s
** [[hallucination]]s
** disorganized speech (e.g., frequent derailment or incoherence; speaking in abstracts). See [[thought disorder]].
** grossly disorganized behavior (e.g. dressing inappropriately, crying frequently) or [[catatonic]] behavior
** negative symptoms, i.e., [[affective flattening]] (lack or decline in emotional response), [[alogia]] (lack or decline in speech), or [[avolition]] (lack or decline in motivation).

:Note: Only one Criterion A symptom is required if delusions are bizarre or hallucinations consist of hearing one voice participating in a running commentary of the patient's actions or of hearing two or more voices conversing with each other.

*B) Social/occupational dysfunction: For a significant portion of the time since the onset of the disturbance, one or more major areas of functioning such as work, interpersonal relations, or self-care, are markedly below the level achieved prior to the onset.

*C) Duration: Continuous signs of the disturbance persist for at least six months. This six-month period must include at least one month of symptoms (or less, if successfully treated) that meet Criterion A.

Additional criteria (D, E and F) are also given that exclude a diagnosis of schizophrenia if symptoms of [[mood disorder]] or [[pervasive developmental disorder]] are present. Additionally a diagnosis of schizophrenia is excluded if the symptoms are the direct result of a substance (e.g., abuse of a drug, medication) or a general medical condition.

===Subtypes===
Historically, schizophrenia in the [[Western world|West]] was classified into simple, [[catatonia|catatonic]], [[hebephrenic]], and [[paranoia|paranoid]]. The DSM now contains five sub-classifications of schizophrenia, the ICD-10 identifies 7:

* (295.2/F20.2) '''catatonic type''' (where marked absences or peculiarities of movement are present),
* (295.1/F20.1) '''[[Disorganized schizophrenia|disorganized type]]''' (where thought disorder and flat affect are present together), 
* (295.3/F20.0) '''paranoid type''' (where delusions and hallucinations are present but thought disorder, disorganized behavior, and affective flattening is absent),
* (295.6/F20.5) '''residual type''' (where positive symptoms are present at a low intensity only) and
* (295.9/F20.3) '''undifferentiated type''' (psychotic symptoms are present but the criteria for paranoid, disorganized, or catatonic types has not been met).

''NB:'' Brackets indicate codes for [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders|DSM]] and [[ICD|ICD-10]] diagnostic manuals, respectively. Some older classifications still use "Hebephrenic schizophrenia" instead of "Disorganized schizophrenia".

===Presentation===
Symptoms may also be described as 'positive symptoms' (those additional to normal experience and behavior) and 'negative symptoms' (the lack or decline in normal experience or behavior). 'Positive symptoms' describe [[psychosis]] and typically include [[delusions]], [[hallucinations]] and [[thought disorder]]. 'Negative symptoms' describe inappropriate or nonpresent emotion, [[poverty of speech]], and lack of motivation. In three-factor models of schizophrenia, a third symptom grouping, the so-called 'disorganization syndrome', is also given. This considers thought disorder and related disorganized behavior to be in a separate symptom cluster from delusions and hallucinations.

Some symptoms, such as social isolation, may be caused by a number of factors. One possible factor is impairment in [[social cognition]], which is associated with schizophrenia, but isolation may also result from an individual reacting to psychotic symptoms (such as paranoia) or avoiding potentially stressful social situations which may exacerbate mental distress in some people.

It is worth noting that many of the positive or psychotic symptoms may occur in a variety of disorders and not only in schizophrenia. The psychiatrist [[Kurt Schneider]] tried to list the particular forms of psychotic symptoms that he thought were particularly useful in distinguishing between schizophrenia and other disorders that could produce psychosis. These are called ''first rank symptoms'' or ''Schneiderian first rank symptoms'' and include delusions of being controlled by an external force, the belief that thoughts are being inserted or withdrawn from your conscious mind, the belief that your thoughts are being broadcast to other people and hearing hallucinated voices which comment on your thoughts or actions, or may have a conversation with other hallucinated voices. As with other diagnostic methods, the reliability of 'first rank symptoms' has been questioned{{Fn|4}}, although they remain in use as diagnostic criteria in many countries.

===Diagnostic issues and controversies===
It has been argued that the diagnostic approach to schizophrenia is flawed, as it relies on an assumption of a clear dividing line between what is considered to be [[mental illness]] (fulfilling the diagnostic criteria) and [[mental health]] (not fulfilling the criteria). Recently it has been argued, notably by psychiatrist [[Jim van Os]] and psychologist [[Richard Bentall]], that this makes little sense, as studies have shown that many people have psychotic experiences{{Fn|5}} {{Fn|65}} and have delusion-like ideas{{Fn|67}} without becoming distressed, disabled or diagnosable by the categorical system (potentially because they interpret their experiences in more positive ways, or hold more pragmatic and commonly accepted beliefs).

Of particular concern is that the decision as to whether a symptom is present is a subjective decision by the person making the diagnosis or relies on an incoherent definition (for example, see the entries on [[delusion#Diagnostic issues and controversies|delusion]]s and [[thought disorder#Diagnostic issues and controversies|thought disorder]] for a discussion of this issue). More recently, it has been argued that psychotic symptoms are not a good basis for making a diagnosis of schizophrenia as "psychosis is the 'fever' of mental illness &mdash; a serious but nonspecific indicator".{{Fn|6}}

Perhaps because of these factors, studies examining the [[diagnosis]] of schizophrenia have typically shown relatively low or inconsistent levels of diagnostic reliability. Most famously, [[David Rosenhan|David Rosenhan's]] 1972 study, published as ''[[Rosenhan experiment|On being sane in insane places]]'', demonstrated that the diagnosis of schizophrenia was (at least at the time) often subjective and unreliable. More recent studies have found agreement between any [[two]] psychiatrists when diagnosing schizophrenia tends to reach about 65% at best{{Fn|7}}. This, and the results of earlier studies of diagnostic reliability (which typically reported even lower levels of agreement) have led some critics to argue that the diagnosis of schizophrenia should be abandoned.{{Fn|8}}

Proponents have argued for a new approach that would use the presence of specific [[neurocognitive deficit]]s to make a diagnosis. These often accompany schizophrenia and take the form of a reduction or impairment in basic psychological functions such as [[memory]], [[attention]], [[executive function]] and [[problem solving]]. It is these sorts of difficulties, rather than the psychotic symptoms (which can in many cases be controlled by [[antipsychotic]] medication), which seem to be the cause of most [[disability]] in schizophrenia. However, this argument is relatively new and it is unlikely that the method of diagnosing schizophrenia will change radically in the near future.

The diagnostic approach to schizophrenia has also been opposed by the proponents of the [[anti-psychiatry]] movement, who argue that classifying specific thoughts and behaviors as an illness allows [[social control]] of people that society finds undesirable but who have committed no crime. They argue that this is a way of un[[justice|just]]ly classifying a social problem as a medical one to allow the forcible detention and treatment of people displaying these behaviors, which is something which can be done under [[Mental health law|mental health legislation]] in most [[Western world|western countries]].

An example of this can be seen in the [[Soviet Union]], where an additional sub-classification of [[sluggishly progressing schizophrenia]] was created. Particularly in the [[Russian SFSR|RSFSR]] (Russian Soviet Federated Socialist Republic), this diagnosis was used for the purpose of silencing political dissidents or forcing them to recant their ideas by the use of forcible confinement and treatment. In 2000 similar concerns about the abuse of psychiatry to unjustly silence and detain practitioners of the [[Falun Gong]] movement by the Chinese government led the [[American Psychiatric Association|American Psychiatric Association's]] ''Committee on the Abuse of Psychiatry and Psychiatrists'' to pass a resolution to urge the [[World Psychiatric Association]] to investigate the situation in [[China]].

Western psychiatric medicine tends to favor a definition of symptoms that depends on form rather than content (an innovation first argued for by psychiatrists [[Karl Jaspers]] and [[Kurt Schneider]]). Therefore, you should be able to believe anything, however unusual or socially unacceptable, without being diagnosed delusional, unless your belief is held in a particular way. In principle, this would stop people being forcibly detained or treated simply for what they believe. However, the distinction between form and content is not easy, or always possible, to make in practice (see [[delusion]]). This had led to accusations by [[anti-psychiatry]], [[surrealism|surrealist]] and mental health system survivor groups that psychiatric abuses exist to some extent in the West as well.

==Causes==
===Genetic and environmental influences===
While the reliability of the schizophrenia diagnosis introduces difficulties in measuring the relative effect of genes and environment (for example, symptoms overlap to some extent with severe [[bipolar disorder]] or major depression), there is evidence to suggest that genetic vulnerability and environmental stressors can act in combination to cause schizophrenia{{Fn|12}}.

The extent to which these factors influence the likelihood of being diagnosed with schizophrenia is debated widely, and currently, controversial. Schizophrenia is likely to be a disorder of complex inheritance (analogous to [[diabetes]] or [[Arterial hypertension|high blood pressure]]). Thus, it is likely that several [[genes]] interact to generate risk for schizophrenia{{Fn|75}}. This, combined with disagreements over which research methods are best, or how data from genetic research should be interpreted, has led to differing estimates over genetic contribution.

====Genetic====
There is substantial evidence that schizophrenia has a heritable component (some estimates are as high as 80%). However, current research suggests that environmental factors play a significant role in the expression of any genetic disposition towards schizophrenia (i.e. if one has the genes that increase risk, this will not automatically result in schizophrenia later in life). A recent review of the genetic evidence has suggested a 28% chance of one identical twin developing schizophrenia if the other already has it{{Fn|9}} (see [[twin study|twin studies]]). However, the estimates of heritability of schizophrenia from twin studies varies a great deal, with some notable studies{{Fn|10}} {{Fn|11}} showing rates as low as 11.0%&ndash;13.8% among monozygotic twins, and 1.8%&ndash;4.1% among dizygotic twins.

A recent review of [[Genetic linkage|linkage]] studies listed seven genes as likely to be involved in the inheritance of schizophrenia or the risk of developing the disease.{{Fn|12}} Evidence comes from research suggesting multiple [[Chromosome|chromosomal]] regions are transmitted to people who are later diagnosed as having schizophrenia. Genetic association studies have suggested some strong candidate genes which may contribute to risk for developing schizophrenia.{{Fn|75}} The strongest evidence points towards genes called COMT (involved in encoding the dopamine catabolic enzyme [[catechol-O-methyl transferase]],{{Fn|13}}) dysbindin (DTNBP1) and neuregulin-1 (NRG1).

====Environmental====
There is considerable evidence indicating that stressful life events cause or trigger schizophrenia.{{Fn|15}} Childhood experiences of abuse or trauma have also been implicated as risk factors for a diagnosis of schizophrenia later in life.{{Fn|16}} {{Fn|17}} {{Fn|18}} 

There is also consistent evidence that negative attitudes towards individuals with (or with a risk of developing) schizophrenia can have a significant adverse impact. In particular, critical comments, hostility, and intrusive or controlling attitudes (termed 'high expressed emotion' by researchers) from family members have been found to correlate with a higher risk of relapse in schizophrenia across cultures.{{Fn|70}} It is not clear whether such attitudes play a causal role in the onset of schizophrenia. The research has focused on family members but also appears to relate to professional staff in regular contact with clients.{{Fn|71}} While initial work addressed schizophrenia, these attitudes have also been found to play a significant role in other mental health problems.{{Fn|66}} This approach does not blame 'bad parenting' or staffing, but addresses the attitudes, behaviors and interactions of all parties. 

Factors such as [[poverty]] and [[discrimination]] also appear to be involved in increasing the risk of schizophrenia or schizophrenia relapse, perhaps due to the high levels of stress they engender. Racism in society, including in diagnostic practices, and/or the stress of living in a different culture, may explain why minority communities have shown higher rates of schizophrenia than members of the same ethnic groups resident in their home country. The "social drift hypothesis" suggests that the functional problems related to schizophrenia, or the stigma and prejudice attached to them, can result in more limited employment and financial opportunities, so that the causal pathway goes from mental health problems to poverty, rather than, or in addition to, the other direction.

One particularly stable and replicable finding has been the association between living in an [[Urbanization|urban]] environment and risk of developing schizophrenia, even after factors such as [[drug use]], [[ethnic group]] and size of [[social group]] have been controlled for.{{Fn|19}} A recent study of 4.4 million men and women in [[Sweden]] found a 68%&ndash;77% increased risk of [[psychosis]] for people living in the most urbanized environments, a significant proportion of which is likely to be accounted for by schizophrenia.{{Fn|20}}

One curious finding is that people diagnosed with schizophrenia are more likely to have been born in [[winter]] or [[spring (season)|spring]]{{Fn|21}} (at least in the [[northern hemisphere]]). However, the effect is not large and it is still not clear why this may occur.

===Neurobiological influences===
====Early neurodevelopment====
It is also thought that processes in early [[neurodevelopment]] are important, particularly during pregnancy. For example, women who were pregnant during the [[Dutch famine of 1944]], where many people were close to starvation, had a higher chance of having a child who would later develop schizophrenia{{Fn|22}}. Similarly, studies of [[Finland|Finnish]] mothers who were pregnant when they found out that their husbands had been killed during the [[Winter War]] of 1939&ndash;1940 have shown that their children were much more likely to develop schizophrenia when compared with mothers who found out about their husbands' death after pregnancy{{Fn|23}}, suggesting that even [[psychological trauma]] in the mother may have an effect. Furthermore, there is now significant evidence that [[prenatal]] exposure to infections increases the risk for developing schizophrenia later in life, providing additional evidence for a link between developmental pathology and risk of developing the condition.{{Fn|73}}

Some researchers have proposed that environmental influences during childhood also interact with neurobiological risk factors to influence the likelihood of developing schizophrenia later in life. The neurological development of children is considered sensitive to features of dysfunctional social settings, such as trauma, violence, lack of warmth in personal relationships and hostility. These have all been found to be risk factors for the later development of schizophrenia. Research has suggested that effects of the childhood environment, favorable or unfavorable, interact with genetics and the processes of neurodevelopment, with long-term consequences for brain function. Consequently, this is thought to influence the underlying vulnerability for psychosis later in life, particularly during the adult years.{{Fn|24}}

[[Image:Schizophrenia_PET_scan.jpg|frame|Data from a [[Positron emission tomography|PET]] study{{Fn|25}} suggests the less the [[frontal lobe]]s activated (<font color="red">red</font>) during a [[working memory]] task, the greater the increase in abnormal [[dopamine]] activity in the [[striatum]] (<font color="green">green</font>), thought to be related to the [[neurocognitive deficit]]s in schizophrenia.]]

====Role of dopamine====
In adult life, particular importance has been placed upon the function (or malfunction) of dopamine in the [[mesolimbic pathway]] in the brain. This theory, known as the [[dopamine hypothesis of schizophrenia]], largely resulted from the accidental finding that a drug group which blocks dopamine function, known as the [[phenothiazines]], reduced psychotic symptoms. These drugs have now been developed further and antipsychotic medication is commonly used as a first line treatment.

However, this theory is now thought to be overly simplistic as a complete explanation, partly because newer antipsychotic medication (called [[atypical antipsychotic]] medication) is equally effective as older medication (called [[typical antipsychotic]] medication), but also affects [[serotonin]] function and may have slightly less of a [[dopamine]] blocking effect. Psychiatrist [[David Healy]] has also argued that [[pharmaceutical companies]] have promoted certain oversimplified biological theories of mental illness to promote their own sales of biological treatments.{{Fn|26}}

====Role of glutamate and the NMDA receptor====
Interest has also focused on the neurotransmitter [[glutamate]] and the reduced function of the [[NMDA receptor|NMDA glutamate receptor]] in the development of schizophrenia. This theory has largely been suggested by abnormally low levels of glutamate receptors found in postmortem brains of people previously diagnosed with schizophrenia{{Fn|27}} and the discovery that the glutamate blocking drugs such as [[phencyclidine]] and [[ketamine]] can mimic the symptoms and cognitive problems associated with the condition.{{Fn|59}} The fact that reduced glutamate function is linked to poor performance on tests requiring [[frontal lobe]] and [[hippocampus|hippocampal]] function and that glutamate can affect [[dopamine]] function, all of which have been implicated in schizophrenia, have suggested the [[glutamate hypothesis of schizophrenia]] as an increasingly popular explanation.{{Fn|28}}  Further support of this theory has come from trials showing the efficacy of molecules, which are coagonists at the NMDA receptor complex, in reducing schizophrenic symptoms.  The precursors D-serine, glycine, and D-cycloserine all enhance NMDA function through the glycine co-agonist site.  Several placebo controlled trials have shown a reduction mainly in negative symptoms with high dose therapy.{{Fn|60}} Currently type 1 glycine transporter inhibitors are in late-state preclinical for the treatment of schizophrenia.  They increase glycine concentrations in the brain thus causing increased NMDA receptor activation and a reduction in symptoms.{{Fn|61}}

====Anatomy and physiology of the brain====
Much recent research has focused on differences in structure or function in certain brain areas in people diagnosed with schizophrenia.

Early evidence for differences in the neural structure came from the discovery of [[ventricular system|ventricular]] enlargement in people diagnosed with schizophrenia, for whom negative symptoms were most prominent{{Fn|29}}. However, this finding has not proved particularly reliable on the level of the individual person, with considerable variation between patients. A letter to the editor of the American Journal of Psychiatry links ventricular enlargement with exposure to antipsychotic drugs [http://ajp.psychiatryonline.org/cgi/content/full/156/11/1843-b].

More recent studies have shown a large number of differences in brain structure between people with and without diagnoses of schizophrenia.{{Fn|30}} However, as with earlier studies, many of these differences are only reliably detected when comparing groups of people, and are unlikely to predict any differences in brain structure of an individual person with schizophrenia.

Studies using [[neuropsychological test]]s and [[brain imaging]] technologies such as [[Functional magnetic resonance imaging|fMRI]] and [[Positron emission tomography|PET]] to examine functional differences in brain activity have shown that differences seem to most commonly occur in the [[frontal lobe]]s, [[hippocampus]], and [[temporal lobe]]s{{Fn|31}}. These differences are heavily linked to the [[neurocognitive deficit]]s which often occur with schizophrenia, particularly in areas of [[memory]], [[attention]], [[problem solving]], [[executive function]] and [[social cognition]].

[[Electroencephalography|Electroencephalograph]] (EEG) recordings of persons with schizophrenia performing perception oriented tasks showed an absence of [[gamma band]] activity in the brain, indicating weak integration of critical neural networks in the brain.{{Fn|32}} Those who experienced intense hallucinations, delusions and disorganized thinking showed the lowest frequency synchronization. None of the drugs taken by the persons scanned had moved neural synchrony back into the gamma frequency range. Gamma band and working memory alterations may be related to alterations in interneurons that produced the neurotransmitter [[GABA]]. Alterations in a subclass of GABAergic interneurons which produce the calcium binding protein [[parvalbumin]] have been shown to exist in the [[dorsolateral prefrontal cortex|DLPFC]] in schizophrenia. {{Fn|33}}

==Incidence and prevalence==
Schizophrenia is typically diagnosed in late adolescence or early adulthood. It is found approximately equally in men and women, though the onset tends to be later in women, who also tend to have a better course and outcome. Although rare, there are also instances of [[childhood onset schizophrenia]] and [[late-onset schizophrenia]] that occurs in the elderly.

The lifetime [[prevalence]] of schizophrenia is commonly given at 1%; however, a recent review of studies from around the world estimated it to be 0.55%{{Fn|34}}. The same study also found that prevalence may vary greatly from country to country, despite the received wisdom that schizophrenia occurs at the same rate throughout the world. It is worth noting however, that this may be in part due to differences in the way schizophrenia is diagnosed. The [[Incidence (epidemiology)|incidence]] of schizophrenia was given as a range of between 7.5 and 16.3 cases per year per 100,000 population.

Schizophrenia is also a major cause of [[disability]]. In a recent 14-country study{{Fn|35}}, active [[psychosis]] was ranked the third most disabling condition after [[quadriplegia]] and [[dementia]] and before [[paraplegia]] and [[blindness]].

==Treatment==
===Medication and hospitalization===
The first line pharmacological therapy for schizophrenia is usually the use of [[antipsychotic]] medication {{Fn|72}}. The concept of 'curing' schizophrenia is controversial as there are no clear criteria for what might constitute a [[cure]], although some criteria for the remission of symptoms have recently been suggested{{Fn|63}}. Therefore, antipsychotic drugs are only thought to provide symptomatic relief from the positive symptoms of psychosis. The newer [[atypical antipsychotic]] medications (such as [[clozapine]], [[risperidone]], [[olanzapine]], [[quetiapine]], [[ziprasidone]], [[aripiprazole]], and [[amisulpride]]) are usually preferred over older [[typical antipsychotic]] medications (such as [[chlorpromazine]] and [[haloperidol]]) due to their favorable side-effect profile. Compared to the typical antipsychotics, the atypicals are associated with a lower incident rate of [[extra pyramidal side-effect]]s (EPS) and [[tardive dyskinesia]] (TD) although they are more likely to induce weight gain and so increase risk for [[obesity]]-related diseases{{Fn|62}}. It is still unclear whether newer drugs reduce the chances of developing the rare but potentially life-threatening [[neuroleptic malignant syndrome]] (NMS). While the atypical antipsychotics are associated with less EPS and TD than the conventional antipsychotics, some of the agents in this class (especially olanzapine and clozapine) appear to be associated with metabolic side effects such as [[weight gain]], [[hyperglycemia]] and [[hypertriglyceridemia]] that must be considered when choosing appropriate pharmacotherapy.

Atypical and typical antipsychotics are generally thought to be equivalent for the treatment of the positive symptoms of schizophrenia. It has been suggested by some researchers that the atypicals have some beneficial effects on negative symptoms and cognitive deficits associated with schizophrenia, although the clinical significance of these effects has yet to be established. However, recent reviews have suggested that typical antipsychotics, when dosed conservatively, may have similar effects to atypicals.{{Fn|36}} The atypical antipsychotics are much more costly as they are still within patent, whereas the older drugs are available in inexpensive generic forms. [[Aripiprazole]] is a drug from a new class of antipsychotic drugs (variously named 'dopamine system stabilizers' or 'partial dopamine agonists'{{Fn|37}}) that have recently been developed and is now widely licensed to treat schizophrenia.

The efficacy of schizophrenia treatment is often assessed by using standardized assessment methods, one of the most common being the positive and negative syndrome scale ([[PANSS]]).{{Fn|68}}

Hospitalization may occur with severe episodes. This can be voluntary or (if mental health legislation allows it) involuntary (called civil or [[involuntary commitment]]). Mental health legislation may also allow people to be treated against their will. However, in many countries such legislation does not exist, or does not have the power to enforce involuntary hospitalization or treatment.

===Therapy and community support===
[[Psychotherapy]] or other forms of talk therapy may be offered, with cognitive behavioral therapy being the most frequently used. This may focus on the direct reduction of the symptoms, or on related aspects, such as issues of [[self-esteem]], social functioning, and insight. Although the results of early trials with [[cognitive behavioral therapy]] (CBT) were inconclusive{{Fn|38}}, more recent reviews suggest that CBT can be an effective treatment for the psychotic symptoms of schizophrenia{{fn|39}}.

A relatively new approach has been the use of cognitive remediation therapy, a technique aimed at remediating the [[neurocognitive deficit]]s sometimes present in schizophrenia. Based on techniques of [[neuropsychological rehabilitation]], early evidence has shown it to be cognitively effective, with some improvements related to measurable changes in brain activation as measured by [[fMRI]].{{Fn|40}}

[[Electroconvulsive therapy]] (also known as ECT or 'electroshock therapy') may be used in countries where it is legal. It is not considered a [[first line treatment]] but may be prescribed in cases where other treatments have failed. [[Psychosurgery]] has now become a rare procedure and is not a recommended treatment for schizophrenia.

Other support services may also be available, such as drop-in centers, visits from members of a 'community mental health team' or [[assertive community treatment]] team, and patient-led support groups. In recent years the importance of service-user led recovery based movements has grown substantially throughout [[Europe]] and [[United States|America]]. Groups such as the [[Hearing Voices Network]] and more recently, the [[Paranoia Network]], have developed a self-help approach that aims to provide support and assistance outside of the traditional medical model adopted by mainstream psychiatry. By avoiding framing personal experience in terms of criteria for [[mental illness]] or [[mental health]], they aim to destigmatize the experience and encourage individual responsibility and a positive self-image.

In many non-Western societies, schizophrenia may be treated with more informal, community-led methods. A particularly sobering thought for Western psychiatry is that the outcome for people diagnosed with schizophrenia in non-Western countries may actually be much better{{Fn|41}} than for people in the West. The reasons for this recently discovered fact are still far from clear, although cross-cultural studies are being conducted to find out why.

===Dietary supplements===
[[Omega-3 fatty acids]] (found naturally in foods such as oily fish, flax seeds, hemp seeds, walnuts and canola oil) have recently been studied as a treatment for schizophrenia. Although the number of research trials has been limited, the majority of randomized controlled trials have found omega-3 supplements to be effective when used as a dietary supplement.{{Fn|64}}

==Prognosis==
[[Prognosis]] for any particular individual affected by schizophrenia is particularly hard to judge as treatment and access to treatment is continually changing, as new methods become available and medical recommendations change.

One retrospective study has shown that about a third of people make a full recovery, about a third show improvement but not a full recovery, and a third remain ill.{{Fn|42}} A more recent study using stricter recovery criteria (i.e. concurrent remission of positive and negative symptoms and specific instances of adequate social / vocational functioning) reported a recovery rate of 13.7%.{{Fn|43}}

The exact definition of what constitutes a recovery has not been widely defined, however, although criteria have recently been suggested to define a remission in symptoms.{{Fn|63}} Therefore, this makes it difficult to give an exact estimate as recovery and remission rates are not always comparable across studies.

The [[World Health Organization]] conducted two long-term follow-up studies involving more than 2,000 people suffering from schizophrenia in different countries, and discovered these patients have much better long-term outcomes in poor countries ([[India]], [[Colombia]] and [[Nigeria]]) than in rich countries ([[United States|USA]], [[United Kingdom|UK]], [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], [[Denmark]], [[Czechoslovakia]], [[Japan]], and [[Russia]]),{{Fn|44}} despite the fact antipsychotic medication is typically not widely available in poorer countries.

Prognosis also depends on some other factors. Females tend to show recovery rates higher than males, and acute and sudden onset of schizophrenia is associated with higher rates of recovery, while gradual onset is associated with lower rates. Most studies done on this subject, however, are correlational in nature, and a clear cause-and- relationship is difficult to establish. Pre-morbid functioning and positive prognosis also seem to be correlated.

In a study of over 168,000 Swedish citizens undergoing psychiatric treatment, schizophrenia was associated with an average life expectancy of approximately 80-85% of that of the general population. Women with a diagnosis of schizophrenia were found to have a slightly better life expectancy than that of men, and as a whole, a diagnosis of schizophrenia was associated with a better life expectancy than [[substance abuse]], [[personality disorder]], [[heart attack]] and [[stroke]].{{Fn|45}}

There is an extremely high [[suicide]] rate associated with schizophrenia. A recent study showed that 30% of patients diagnosed with this condition had attempted suicide at least once during their lifetime.{{Fn|46}} Another study suggested that 10% of persons with schizophrenia die by suicide.{{Fn|47}}

==Schizophrenia and drug use==
The relationship between schizophrenia and drug use is complex, meaning that a clear causal connection between drug use and schizophrenia has been difficult to tease apart. There is strong evidence that using certain drugs can trigger either the onset or relapse of schizophrenia in some people. It may also be the case, however, that people with schizophrenia use drugs to overcome negative feelings associated with both the commonly prescribed antipsychotic medication and the condition itself, where negative emotion, [[paranoia]] and [[anhedonia]] are all considered to be core features.

The rate of substance use is known to be particularly high in this group. In a recent study, 60% of people with schizophrenia were found to use substances and 37% would be diagnosable with a substance use disorder.{{Fn|74}}

===Hallucinogens===
Schizophrenia can sometimes be triggered by heavy use of [[stimulant]] or [[Psychedelics, dissociatives and deliriants|hallucinogenic]] drugs, although some claim that a predisposition towards developing schizophrenia is needed for this to occur. There is also some evidence suggesting that people suffering schizophrenia but responding to treatment can have relapse because of subsequent drug use. Some widely known cases where hallucinogens have been suspected of precipitating schizophrenia are [[Pink Floyd]] founder-member [[Syd Barrett]] and [[Beach Boys]] songwriter [[Brian Wilson]].

Drugs such as [[methamphetamine]], [[ketamine]], [[Phencyclidine|PCP]], and [[LSD]] have been used to mimic schizophrenia for research purposes, although this has now fallen out of favor with the [[scientific research community]], as the differences between the drug induced states and the typical presentation of schizophrenia have become clear.

Hallucinogenic drugs were also briefly tested as possible treatments for schizophrenia by psychiatrists such as [[Humphry Osmond]] and [[Abram Hoffer]] in the 1950s. It was mainly for this experimental treatment of schizophrenia that LSD administration was legal, briefly before its use as a [[recreational drug]] led to its criminalization.

===Cannabis===
There is increasing evidence that [[cannabis (drug)|cannabis]] use can contribute to the onset of schizophrenia. Some studies suggest that cannabis is neither a sufficient nor necessary factor in developing schizophrenia, but that cannabis may significantly increase the risk of developing schizophrenia and may be, among other things, a significant causal factor. Nevertheless, some previous research in this area has been criticised as it has often not been clear whether cannabis use is a cause or effect of schizophrenia. To address this issue, a recent review of studies from which a causal contribution to schizophrenia can be assessed has suggested that cannabis statistically doubles the risk of developing schizophrenia on the individual level, and may be responsible for up to 8% of cases in the population.{{Fn|48}}

===Tobacco===
It has been noted that the majority of people with schizophrenia (estimated between 75% and 90%) smoke [[tobacco]]. However, people diagnosed with schizophrenia have a much lower than average chance of developing and dying from [[lung cancer]]. While the reason for this is unknown, it may be because of a genetic resistance to the cancer, a side-effect of drugs being taken, or a statistical effect of increased likelihood of dying from causes other than lung cancer{{Fn|49}}.

It is argued that the increased level of smoking in schizophrenia may be due to a desire to self-medicate with [[nicotine]]. A recent study of over 50,000 [[Sweden|Swedish]] conscripts found that there was a small but [[Statistical significance|significant]] protective effect of smoking cigarettes on the risk of developing schizophrenia later in life.{{Fn|50}} While the authors of the study stressed that the risks of smoking far outweigh these minor benefits, this study provides further evidence for the 'self-medication' theory of smoking in schizophrenia and may give clues as to how schizophrenia might develop at the molecular level. Furthermore, many people with schizophrenia have smoked tobacco products long before they are diagnosed with the illness, and some groups advocate that the chemicals in tobacco have actually contributed to the onset of the illness and have no benefit of any kind.

It is of interest that cigarette smoking affects liver function such that the [[antipsychotic drugs]] used to treat schizophrenia are broken down in the blood stream more quickly. This means that smokers with schizophrenia need slightly higher doses of antipsychotic drugs in order for them to be effective than do their non-smoking counterparts.

==Schizophrenia and violence==
===Violence perpetrated by people with schizophrenia===
Although schizophrenia is sometimes associated with violence in the media, only a small minority of people with schizophrenia become violent{{Fn|51}}, and only a minority of people who commit criminal violence have been diagnosed with schizophrenia{{Fn|52}} {{Fn|53}}.

Research has suggested that schizophrenia is associated with a slight increase in risk of violence, although this risk is largely due to a small sub-group of individuals for whom violence is associated with concurrent substance abuse and ceasing psychiatric drugs{{Fn|51}}. For the most serious acts of violence, long-term independent studies of convicted murderers in both [[New Zealand]]{{Fn|52}} and [[Sweden]]{{Fn|53}} found that 3.7%&ndash;8.9% had been given a previous diagnosis of schizophrenia.

There is some evidence to suggest that in some people, the drugs used to treat schizophrenia may produce an increased risk for violence, largely due to agitation induced by [[akathisia]], a [[Adverse drug reaction|side effect]] sometimes associated with [[antipsychotic]] medication.{{Fn|54}} Similarly, abuse experienced in childhood may contribute both to a slight increase in risk for violence in adulthood, as well as the development of schizophrenia.{{Fn|16}}

===Violence against people with schizophrenia===
Research has shown that a person diagnosed with schizophrenia is more likely to be a victim of violence (4.3% in a one month period) than the perpetrator{{Fn|55}}.

==Alternative approaches to schizophrenia==
An approach broadly known as the [[anti-psychiatry]] movement, notably most active in the 1960s, has opposed the orthodox medical view of schizophrenia as an illness.

Psychiatrist [[Thomas Szasz]] argues that psychiatric patients are not ill but are just individuals with unconventional thoughts and behavior that make society uncomfortable. He argues that society unjustly seeks to control such individuals by classifying their behavior as an illness and forcibly treating them as a method of [[social control]]. It is worth noting that Szasz has never considered himself to be "anti-psychiatry" in the sense of being against psychiatric treatment, but simply believes that it should be conducted between consenting adults, rather than imposed upon anyone against their will.  Szasz co-founded the anti-psychiatry group [[Citizens' Commission on Human Rights]] with the [[Church of Scientology]], who are well-noted for their anti-psychiatric stance.

Similarly, psychiatrists [[R. D. Laing]], [[Silvano Arieti]], [[Theodore Lidz]] and to a certain degree [[Trauma model of mental disorders|Colin Ross]] have argued that the symptoms of what is normally called mental illness are comprehensible reactions to impossible demands that society and particularly family life places on some sensitive individuals. Laing, Arieti and Lidz were revolutionary in valuing the ''content'' of [[psychosis|psychotic]] experience as worthy of interpretation, rather than considering it simply as a secondary but essentially meaningless marker of underlying psychological or neurological distress. Laing's work, co-authored with Aaron Esterson, ''Sanity, Madness and the Family'' (1964) described eleven case studies of people diagnosed with schizophrenia and argued that the content of their actions and statements was meaningful and logical in the context of their family and life situations.  Arieti's ''[[Interpretation of Schizophrenia]]'' won the 1975 scientific [[National Book Award]] in the United States.

In the 1976 book ''[[The Origin of Consciousness in the Breakdown of the Bicameral Mind]]'', psychologist [[Julian Jaynes]] proposed that until the beginning of historic times, schizophrenia or a similar condition was the normal state of human consciousness. This would take the form of a "[[bicameral mind]]" where a normal state of low affect, suitable for routine activities, would be interrupted in moments of crisis by "mysterious voices" giving instructions, which early people characterized as interventions from the gods. This theory was briefly controversial. Continuing research has failed to either further confirm or refute the thesis.

Psychiatrist [[Tim Crow]] has argued that schizophrenia may be the evolutionary price we pay for a left brain hemisphere specialization for [[language]].{{Fn|56}} Since psychosis is associated with greater levels of right brain hemisphere activation and a reduction in the usual left brain hemisphere dominance, our language abilities may have evolved at the cost of causing schizophrenia when this system breaks down.

Researchers into [[Shaman|shamanism]] have speculated that in some cultures schizophrenia or related conditions may predispose an individual to becoming a shaman{{Fn|57}}. Certainly, the experience of having access to multiple realities is not uncommon in schizophrenia, and is a core experience in many shamanic traditions. Equally, the shaman may have the skill to bring on and direct some of the [[altered state of consciousness|altered states of consciousness]] psychiatrists label as illness. (See [[anti-psychiatry]].) Speculations regarding primary and important religious figures as having schizophrenia abound. Some commentators have endorsed the idea that major religious figures experienced psychosis, heard voices and displayed delusions of grandeur.

[[Alternative medicine]] tends to hold the view that schizophrenia is primarily caused by imbalances in the body's reserves and absorption of [[dietary mineral]]s, [[vitamin]]s, fats, and/or the presence of excessive levels of toxic [[heavy metals]]. The body's adverse reactions to [[gluten]] are also strongly implicated in some alternative theories (see [[gluten-free, casein-free diet]]).

One theory put forward by psychiatrists [[E. Fuller Torrey]] and R.H. Yolken is that the parasite [[Toxoplasma gondii]] leads to some, if not many, cases of schizophrenia.{{Fn|58}}

An additional approach is suggested by the work of [[Richard Bandler]] who argues that "The usual difference between someone who hallucinates and someone who visualizes normally, is that the person who hallucinates doesn't know he's doing it or doesn't have any choice about it." (''[[Time for a Change]]'', p107). He suggests that because visualization is a sophisticated mental capability, schizophrenia is a skill, albeit an involuntary and dysfunctional one that is being used but not controlled. He therefore suggests that a significant route to treating schizophrenia might be to teach the missing skill - how to distinguish created reality from consensus external reality, to reduce its maladaptive impact, and ultimately how to exercise appropriate control over the vizualization or auditory process. Hypnotic approaches have been explored by the physician [[Milton H. Erickson]] as a means of facilitating this.

Regarding schizophrenia as a waking dreamer syndrome, Jie Zhang hypothesizes that the hallucinations of schizophrenia are caused by the activation of the continual-activation mechanism during waking, a mechanism that induces dreaming while asleep, due to the malfunction of the continual-activation thresholds in the conscious part of brain.{{Fn|69}}
