'''KNYN''' is an [[American]] FM [[radio station]] broadcasting on 99.1 mHz FM and is licensed to Fort Bridger, Wyoming. It primarily broadcasts a variety format, which includes mostly [[soft rock]] and [[adult contemporary]] programming.

===Signal===
KNYN also broadcasts local high school sports games from Evanston as well. KNYN shares its studios with sister station [[KEVA]] 1240 AM. The station's transmitter is located on a mountain north of Evanston, Wyoming, and it broadcasts 27,500 watts to almost all of Uinta County, and far western [[Sweetwater County]]. KNYN can also be heard in various parts of northern [[Utah]].


===Construction permit===
KNYN has applied for a construction permit to both increase its power to 89,000 watts, and move it's transmitter to a mountain located across the border in the [[Uinta Mountains|Uinta Mountain]] Range. Moving the transmitter should allow the station to be heard in Salt Lake City, where it was previously impossible to do so. The mountain in question is also home to several other FM radio stations such as [[KBMG]] (also from Evanston), [[KJQN]], [[KYMV]], [[KOAY]], and [[KYLZ]].
