'''Henry William Allingham''' (6 June 1896 &ndash; 18 July 2009) was a British [[supercentenarian]], [[First World War]] veteran and, for one month, the [[List of living supercentenarians|oldest verified living man]] in the world. On 13 February 2007, he became the UK's [[Florrie Baldwin|second-oldest]] living person, and on 29 March 2009, the oldest ever British male,<ref name=ukoldestever/> surpassing [[Wales|Welshman]] [[John Evans (supercentenarian)|John Evans]] who died aged 112 years and 295 days.<ref name=Evans>{{cite web|url=http://www.grg.org/Adams/L/UK.HTM |title=VERIFIED SUPERCENTENARIAN CASES -- UNITED KINGDOM (As of Apr. 16, 2007) |publisher=grg.org |accessdate=2009-07-30}}</ref> He was also the first ever verified British man to reach the age of 113.

[[File:Henry Allingham in infancy.jpg|thumb|left|Allingham as an infant]]
Allingham was born in 1896 in [[Upper Clapton|Clapton]], [[County of London]]. When he was 14 months old, his father died of [[tuberculosis]]. Brought up by his mother and grandparents, the family moved to [[Clapham]], London, in 1907<ref>{{cite web|url=http://londonist.com/2009/07/oldest_londoner_dies.php|title=Maybe It's Because He Was A Londoner: Henry Allingham|publisher=londonist.com|date=19 July 2009|accessdate=20 July 2009}}</ref> and  attended a [[London County Council]] school.<ref name="Omer"/> Allingham remembered seeing the City Imperial Volunteers return from the [[Second Boer War]],<ref name=Independent20071104>{{cite news|url=http://news.independent.co.uk/people/profiles/article3127348.ece|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http://news.independent.co.uk/people/profiles/article3127348.ece&date=2007-12-01|title=Remembrance: The old man and the boy, united by grief|work=[[The Independent]]|date=2007-11-04|archivedate=2007-12-01}}</ref> and also recalled watching [[W.

Allingham wanted to join the war effort in August 1914 as a [[despatch rider]], but his critically ill mother managed to persuade him to stay at home and look after her. However, after his mother died in 1915, Allingham enlisted with the [[Royal Naval Air Service]] (RNAS). He became formally rated as an [[aircraftman|Air Mechanic Second Class]] on 21 September 1915, and was posted to [[Chingford]] before completing his training at [[Sheerness]], [[Kent]]. His RNAS serial number was RNAS F8317.<ref name="Omer"/>

After graduation, Allingham was posted to the RNAS Air Station at [[Great Yarmouth]] where his job was aircraft maintenance. On 13 April 1916, [[George V of the United Kingdom|King George V]] inspected the air station and its aircraft. He was disappointed when the king turned and left just before he would have had a chance to speak to him. Allingham also worked in [[Bacton, Norfolk]], further up the coast, where night-flying was conducted.<ref name="Omer"/>

Allingham was involved in supporting anti-[[submarine]] patrols. A typical patrol would last two or three days and would involve the manual labour of hoisting a seaplane in and out of the water by means of a deck-mounted [[derrick]].<ref name="Omer"/>

[[Image:Sopwith Schneider.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Sopwith Schneider]]
In the run-up to what has become known as the [[Battle of Jutland]], Allingham was ordered to join the [[naval trawler]] HMT ''Kingfisher''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.raf.mod.uk/news/archive.cfm?storyid=72FA6D51-1143-EC82-2E02D1E42DF97199| title=RAF's oldest hero |publisher=RAF| accessdate=2008-11-11|archiveurl=http://collections.europarchive.org/tna/20081108104809/http://www.raf.mod.uk/news/archive.cfm?storyid=72FA6D51-1143-EC82-2E02D1E42DF97199|archivedate=2008-08-11}}</ref> Onboard was a [[Sopwith Schneider]] [[seaplane]] that was used to look out for the [[Germany|German]] [[High Seas Fleet]]. Allingham's responsibilities included helping to launch the aircraft. Although the ''Kingfisher'' was not directly involved in the battle (it shadowed the [[British Grand Fleet]] and then the High Seas Fleet), Allingham still rightfully claimed to be the last known survivor of that battle and can recall "seeing shells ricocheting across the sea."<ref name="portraits">{{cite web|url=http://www.portraits.co.uk/henrystory.html|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http://www.portraits.co.uk/henrystory.html&date=2007-12-01|title=A portrait of Henry Allingham|publisher=portraits.co.uk|date=2005-12|archivedate=2007-12-01
|accessdate=2009-07-19}}</ref>

In September 1917, Allingham, by now an [[Leading Aircraftman|Air Mechanic First Class]], was posted to the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]] to join [[No. 212 Squadron RAF|No. 12 Squadron RNAS]]. This unit acted as a training squadron for other RNAS squadrons based on the Western Front. There is also some evidence that the squadron was involved in combat operations. When Allingham arrived at [[Petite-Synthe]], both the [[Royal Flying Corps]] (RFC) and the RNAS were involved in the [[Battle of Passchendaele|Ypres]] offensive. Allingham also instrumented the very first reconnaissance aircraft camera during the First World War.<ref name="portraits"/> On 3 November 1917, he was posted to the aircraft depot at [[Dunkirk]], [[France]] where he remained for the rest of the war, on aircraft repair and recovery duties. He recalls being bombed from the air and shelled from both the land and the sea.<ref name="Omer"/>

He transferred to the [[Royal Air Force]] when the RNAS and the RFC were merged on 1 April 1918. At that time he was ranked as a Rigger Aero, Aircraft Mechanic Second Class and was given a new service number: 208317. At the time of his death he was believed to be the last surviving founding member of the RAF. Allingham returned to the Home Establishment in February 1919 and was formally discharged to the RAF Reserve on 16 April 1919.<ref name="Omer"/>

==Inter-war years==
===Career===
In addition to his military service as a mechanic, Allingham spent the vast majority of his professional life as an engineer. His employers included Thorns Car Body Makers, Vickers General Motors and  H.J.M. Car Body Builders.<ref>Allingham and Goodwin, pp. 133-137</ref>

He started his longest stretch of employment in 1934 designing new car bodies for the [[Ford|Ford Motor Company]] at their [[Dagenham]] plant<ref>Allingham and Goodwin, p. 137</ref> which had only opened a few years previously in 1931.<ref name="hackney">{{cite web|url=http://www.hackney.gov.uk/hackney-people-henry-allingham.htm | title=Hackney People&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp; Henry Allingham|date=2009-03-24|accessdate=2009-06-04 |publisher=[[London Borough of Hackney]]}}</ref>

===Personal life===
Allingham met Dorothy Cator (1895&ndash;1970) in [[Great Yarmouth]], [[Norfolk]] in 1918. They married the same year in [[Romford]], when she was 22. They moved to [[Eastbourne]], [[East Sussex|Sussex]] in 1960 and remained married until she died there from acute and chronic [[lymphatic leukemia]].<ref>{{cite news|

In fact Betty Hankin was still alive aged 89 when her father died, and living in [[Stroud]], [[Gloucestershire]].

==Second World War==
During the [[Second World War]], Allingham was in a [[reserved occupation]] and worked on a number of projects. The most significant of these was perhaps the effort to provide an effective counter-measure to the German magnetic [[naval mine|mine]]s. During his [[Christmas]] lunch in 1939 he was called away to help come up with a system that would neutralise the mines and open the port of [[Harwich]], [[Essex]]. Nine days later, he had successfully completed the task.<ref name="Omer"/>

Allingham continued to work for Ford.

A ceremony at the [[Cenotaph]] in [[Whitehall|Whitehall, London]] on 4 August 2004, marked the 90th anniversary of Britain's entry into the [[First World War]]. This was attended by three other First World War veterans as well as Allingham.

As the last surviving member of the RNAS, and the last living founder member of the RAF, Allingham was an honoured guest when the British Air Services Memorial was unveiled at [[Saint-Omer]] on 11 September 2004. The group of RAF technical trainees that joined him at this ceremony continued to visit Allingham at his retirement home in Eastbourne, demonstrating the bond of respect that these men had for Mr. Allingham, made even more remarkable since almost 90 years separated these young trainees from himself. During this time, Allingham was given the Gold Medal of Saint-Omer, which marked the award of the [[Freedom of the City|Freedom of the Town]].<ref>Allingham and Goodwin, p. 165</ref>

Allingham was invited by the [[International Holographic Portrait Archive]] to have his holographic portrait taken in November 2005, an offer which was accepted. His image was recorded for posterity in December 2005. At the same time, an exhibition was being planned for London's floating naval museum on board HMS ''Belfast'', entitled the ''Ghosts of Jutland''. A copy of this portrait was donated to the museum and [[Birgitte, Duchess of Gloucester|HRH The Duchess of Gloucester]] unveiled the portrait to mark the opening of the exhibition.<ref name="portraits"/>

He was awarded the [[Freedom of the City|freedom of his home town]] of Eastbourne by the mayor on 21 April 2006.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/southern_counties/4931102.stm|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/southern_counties/4931102.stm&date=2007-12-01| title=World War I veteran honoured by home town|date=2006-04-21|archivedate=2007-12-01 |publisher=[[BBC News]]}}</ref> He lived on his own until May 2006 when, one month before his 110th birthday and with failing eyesight, he moved to [[St Dunstan's]], a charity for blind ex-service personnel, at [[Ovingdean]], near [[Brighton]].

Allingham attended the 1 July 2006 commemorations at the [[Thiepval Memorial to the Missing of the Somme|Thiepval Memorial to the Missing]]. He did not attend the 2006 [[Remembrance Day]] parade on 11 November at the Cenotaph as he was in France at a wreath-laying ceremony and to receive the Freedom of The Town of Saint-Omer. He did, however, launch the Eastbourne Poppy Appeal before leaving for this trip.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eastbourne.gov.uk/index.asp?pgid=11672|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http://www.eastbourne.gov.uk/index.asp?pgid=11672&date=2007-12-01|title=Henry Allingham Helps Launch Poppies in Eastbourne|date=2006-11-02|archivedate=2007-12-01|publisher=Eastbourne Borough Council}}</ref>

On 18 April 2007 Allingham visited [[Wilnecote|Wilnecote High School]] in [[Tamworth]], [[Staffordshire]] to answer students' questions about the First World War, after they wrote to veterans asking them about their experiences.

Allingham overtook [[George Frederick Ives]] as the longest lived member of the British Armed Forces on 1 November 2007. He was therefore the longest lived British First World War veteran to date.<ref name=Longest>{{cite web|url=http://www.lastingtribute.co.uk/tribute/allingham/2841546 |title=Henry Allingham |publisher=Living Tribute |accessdate=2009-08-20}}</ref>

Following the death of [[Tomoji Tanabe]] on 19 June 2009, Allingham became the oldest living man. At his death, he was the oldest [[Surviving veterans of World War I|living veteran of the First World War]], but not the longest lived member of any armed force in any conflict; this record is held by [[Emiliano Mercado del Toro]] of [[Puerto Rico]], who also served in the First World War.<ref name="GRG">{{cite web|url=http://www.grg.org/Adams/E.HTM|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.grg.org%2FAdams%2FE.HTM&date=2007-12-01|title=Validated Living Supercentenarians|date=2007-11-29|archivedate=2007-12-01|accessdate=2009-07-19}} (As of 2009-07-19, archive appears empty and current link obviously omits Allingham). </ref> 

Allingham was the oldest living man in [[England]] for several years. Official recognition by [[Guinness World Records]] came in January 2007.<ref>{{cite press release | title = Florence Emily Baldwin takes the title as the new Oldest Woman in the UK | publisher = Guinness World Records | date = 2007-02-15 | url=http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/mediazone/pdfs/news/070215_Oldest_Woman_in_the_UK_dies.pdf |

On 13 February 2007, he became the UK's second-oldest living person behind [[Florrie Baldwin]]. Since the death of French [[supercentenarian]] [[Maurice Floquet]] on 10 November, 2006, Allingham was the oldest validated living man in Europe. The death of [[Japan]]ese man Sukesaburo Nakanishi on 22 August 2007 meant that from then Allingham shared the position of second-oldest man in the world with [[George Francis (supercentenarian)|George Francis]], an [[United States|American]] man also born on 6 June 1896, for more than a year until Francis' death on 27 December, 2008. On 29 March 2009, Allingham became the oldest [[British people|British]] man of all time.<ref name=ukoldestever>{{cite news | url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/sussex/7970710.stm | publisher= [[BBC News]] | title= Veteran is UK's oldest ever man | date= 2009-03-29 | accessdate= 2009-03-29}}</ref> With the death of [[Tomoji Tanabe]] on 19 June 2009 he became the oldest living man in the world; after Allingham's death, that title passed to [[Walter Breuning]] of [[Montana]].

As the number of First World War veterans dwindled calls had been growing to give the last remaining veteran a [[state funeral]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://observer.guardian.co.uk/uk_news/story/0,6903,1664649,00.html|

In [[Harry Patch|Harry Patch's]] book ''The Last Fighting Tommy'', the author claims that Allingham planned to leave his body to medical science.<ref>{{cite book|last =Patch|first =Harry|coauthors =[[Richard van Emden]]|title =The Last Fighting Tommy|publisher =[[Bloomsbury Publishing|Bloomsbury]]|date =2007-08-06|isbn =0747591156|page =256}}</ref> In his own book ''Kitchener's Last Volunteer'' Allingham confirmed that he was intending to leave his body to medical science.<ref>Allingham and Goodwin, p. 171</ref> However he was persuaded by Denis Goodwin to change his mind, as he became a symbol of World War One to remind people of the sacrifices made during the conflict.

===War medals and awards===

Allingham had four medals, two of which were [[World War One - Medal Abbreviations|medals from the First World War]].

Allingham had the following to say about the award:

{{quote|Since entering the engineering profession I always hoped to become a chartered engineer, but when I was younger we just couldn<U+2019>t afford it.
