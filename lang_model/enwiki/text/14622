'''Hurricane Danny''' was the only [[Tropical cyclone|hurricane]] to make [[Landfall (meteorology)|landfall]] in the [[United States]] during the [[1997 Atlantic hurricane season]], and the second hurricane and fourth tropical storm of the season. The system became the earliest-formed fifth tropical or [[Subtropical cyclone|subtropical]] storm of the Atlantic season in history when it attained [[Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale|tropical storm strength]] on July 17, and held that record until the [[2005 Atlantic hurricane season]] when [[Hurricane Emily (2005)|Tropical Storm Emily]] broke that record by several days. Like the previous four tropical or [[Subtropical cyclone|subtropical]] [[cyclones]] of the season, Danny had a non-tropical origin, after a [[Trough (meteorology)|trough]] spawned convection that entered the [[Sea surface temperature|warm waters]] of the [[Gulf of Mexico]]. Danny was guided northeast through the Gulf of Mexico by two [[high pressure area|high pressure areas]], a rare occurrence in the middle of July. After making landfall on the [[Gulf Coast]], Danny tracked across the [[southeastern United States]] and ultimately affected parts of [[New England]] with rain and [[wind]].

Danny is notable for its extreme [[rainfall]], the [[tornadoes]] generated by it, and the [[natural disaster|destruction]] it produced on its path, causing a total of nine fatalities and ${{Formatprice|100000000}} (1997&nbsp;[[United States dollar|USD]], ${{Formatprice|{{Inflation|US|100000000|1997|r=2}}}} {{#time:Y}}&nbsp;USD) in damage. The storm dropped a record amount of rainfall for Alabama, as at least 36.71&nbsp;inches (932&nbsp;mm) fell on [[Dauphin Island]]. Flooding, power outages, and erosion occurred in many areas of the [[Gulf Coast]], and rescues had to be executed from flooded roadways. Tornadoes generated by Danny on the [[East Coast of the United States|East Coast]] caused a great amount of damage. Of the nine fatalities caused by Danny, one happened off the coast of [[Alabama]], four occurred in [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], two occurred in [[South Carolina]], and two occurred in [[North Carolina]].

== Meteorological history ==
{{storm path|Danny 1997 track.png}}
A broad [[troposphere|mid-tropospheric]] [[Trough (meteorology)|trough]] over the southeastern United States spawned an area of [[convection]] over the lower [[Mississippi River Valley]] on July 13, and drifted southward towards the warm [[Sea surface temperature|waters]] of the [[Gulf of Mexico]]. As it moved into the Gulf of Mexico, a weak and isolated surface [[low pressure area]] formed off the coast of [[Louisiana]]. The [[Atmospheric circulation|circulation]] in the system steadily expanded, and initially the surface winds and convection were intermittent. On July 16, deep convection increased and organized near the center, and [[oil rigs]] and [[buoy|surface buoys]] reported surface winds of 30&nbsp;mph (50&nbsp;km/h). Based on the observations, it is estimated the system developed into Tropical Depression Four on July 16 while about 150&nbsp;miles (240&nbsp;km) south of the southwestern Louisiana coastline.<ref name="tcr">{{cite web|author=Richard J. Pasch|year=1998|title=Hurricane Danny Tropical Cyclone Report|publisher=[[National Hurricane Center]]|accessdate=2006-12-28|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/1997danny.html}}</ref>

[[Image:Hurricanedanny09181997.JPG|thumb|Hurricane Danny seen after passing over Southeastern Louisiana]]
The depression slowly organized for the next day, as it drifted to the northeast. On July 17, the rate of organization and development of deep convection increased considerably, and the depression strengthened into Tropical Storm Danny later that day. From the night of July 17 through July 18, Danny quickly developed deep [[convection]] and banding features in the favorable environment of the Gulf of Mexico, and reached hurricane status later on July 18. Located between two high pressure systems, Danny continued its unusual July track to the northeast, and crossed over southeastern Louisiana near the [[Mississippi River Delta]]. A small storm, Danny continued to strengthen after reaching the coastal waters off [[Mississippi]] on the night of July 18, and attained a peak of 80&nbsp;mph (130&nbsp;km/h) early on July 19. The hurricane force winds, however, were confined to the [[eyewall]]. After stalling near the mouth of [[Mobile Bay]] on July 19, Hurricane Danny turned to the east, and made its final landfall near [[Baldwin County, Alabama|Mullet Point, Alabama]] later that day.<ref name="tcr"/>

The storm rapidly weakened as it continued northward, and degenerated into a tropical depression by July 20. The weak depression moved through [[Alabama]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], [[South Carolina]], and [[North Carolina]], maintaining a well-defined [[cloud]] signature.<ref name="tcr"/> Due to a [[Surface weather analysis|front]] behind the system, Danny unusually strengthened to a tropical storm over North Carolina on July 24. This rare phenomenon occurred due to interaction with a developing trough and its associated baroclinic zone.<ref name="tcr"/><ref name="extropclimate">{{cite journal|author=Robert E.

Danny entered the [[Atlantic Ocean]], north of the [[North Carolina]]-[[Virginia]] border, near [[Virginia Beach]]. It quickly reached a secondary peak of {{convert|60|mph|km/h|-1}}, and continued rapidly northeastward towards the waters of the Atlantic. A strong mid to upper-level cyclone turned Danny northward, threatening [[Massachusetts]]. It stalled while just {{convert|30|mi|km|-1}} southeast of [[Nantucket, Massachusetts|Nantucket]] on July 26, turned to the east out to sea, and became [[Extratropical cyclone|extratropical]] later that day. On July 27, the former hurricane merged with a [[Surface weather analysis|frontal zone]].<ref name="tcr"/>

== Preparations ==
[[Image:1997DannyNOLARadar.PNG|thumb|Hurricane Danny just offshore of the Gulf Coast]]
The [[National Hurricane Center]] issued a [[tropical cyclone warnings and watches|hurricane watch]] on July 17, as Danny strengthened to a tropical storm, for the coasts of Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama.  When Danny strengthened to a hurricane on July 18, a few hours before its landfall in far southeastern Louisiana and over a day before landfall in [[Alabama]], the hurricane watch was upgraded to a hurricane warning.<ref name="tcr"/> [[Grand Isle, Louisiana|Grand Isle]] mayor [[Arthur Ballenger]] ordered the [[Emergency evacuation|evacuation]] of the town's 1,500 residents, a decision made due to the large number of tourists on the island and to prevent anyone from being unable to leave the island. With a 5&nbsp;foot (1.5&nbsp;m) storm surge possibility, it had the potential to flood the only highway out of the island. Officials distributed [[sandbags]] to residents in [[St. Bernard Parish]] to seal off easily flooded roads, with officials recommending that residents leave the area.<ref name="cnn91897">{{cite web|author=Valerie Voss, Charles Zewe, Reuters|year=1997|title=Hurricane Danny skims Louisiana tip, moves northeast|publisher=[[CNN]]|accessdate=2006-12-28|url=http://www.cnn.com/WEATHER/9707/18/hurricane.danny/ |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20060617223342/http://www.cnn.com/WEATHER/9707/18/hurricane.danny/ |archivedate = 2006-06-17}} Accessed via the [[Internet Archive#Wayback Machine|Wayback Machine]].</ref>

Prior to the arrival of the hurricane, the governors of [[Governor of Mississippi|Mississippi]] and [[Governor of Alabama|Alabama]] declared disaster emergencies, expecting a {{convert|9|ft|m|sing=on}} storm surge and up to {{convert|20|in|mm|-2}} of rain at that time. Six [[Emergency shelter|shelters]] were opened in [[Mobile County]], though few attended them. Officials also considered opening shelters near local casinos and beaches in [[Biloxi, Mississippi]].<ref name="cnn91997">{{cite web|author=Associated Press, Reuters|year=1997|title=Hurricane Danny heading for Alabama and Mississippi|publisher=CNN|accessdate=2006-12-29|url=http://www.cnn.com/WEATHER/9707/19/hurricane.danny.on/ |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20060620121555/http://www.cnn.com/WEATHER/9707/19/hurricane.danny.on/ |archivedate = 2006-06-20}} Accessed via the [[Internet Archive#Wayback Machine|Wayback Machine]].</ref>

Southeastern [[Massachusetts]] also had a tropical storm warning issued, a few hours before sustained tropical storm force winds affected the area and less than 12&nbsp;hours before its closest approach to the coastline.<ref name="tcr"/>

== Impact ==
[[Image:Danny-rainfall.gif|thumb|Rainfall totals from Hurricane Danny]]
As a small storm, Tropical Storm Danny only caused a damage toll of ${{Formatprice|100000000}} (1997&nbsp;[[United States dollar|USD]], ${{Formatprice|{{Inflation|US|100000000|1997|r=2}}}} {{#time:Y}}&nbsp;USD). A total of 4 direct and 5 indirect deaths resulted from the effects of Danny.<ref name="tcr"/>

=== Gulf Coast ===
Heavy rain and winds buffeted many [[Parish (country subdivision)|parishes]] located east of the city of [[New Orleans, Louisiana|New Orleans]].<ref name="tcr"/><ref name="cnn91997"/> A small [[radius]] near the center of the storm had much of the extreme rainfall, and limited the flooding, which could have been disastrous if it were widespread.<ref name="tcr"/><ref name="NCDClouisiana">{{cite web|author=NCDC|year=1997|title=Event Record Details: Hurricane (Louisiana)|publisher=[[National Climatic Data Center]]|accessdate=2007-01-01|url=http://www4.ncdc.noaa.gov/cgi-win/wwcgi.dll?wwevent~ShowEvent~296745}}</ref> Grand Isle and portions of the lower [[Plaquemines Parish]] were the worst hit in Louisiana. Additionally, Grand Isle reported a wind gust of 100&nbsp;mph (160&nbsp;km/h) and a storm surge of 5.2&nbsp;feet (1.6&nbsp;m).<ref name="NCDClouisiana"/> At [[New Orleans International Airport]], sustained winds of 28&nbsp;mph (45&nbsp;km/h) and gusts of 33&nbsp;mph (53&nbsp;km/h) were reported on July 19.<ref name="usatoday"/> A gauge reported a water level of 4.85&nbsp;feet (1.5&nbsp;m) in [[Venice, Louisiana|Venice]]. Storm [[tides]] were 2 to 3&nbsp;feet (0.6 to 0.9&nbsp;meters) above normal on average.<ref name="NCDClouisiana"/>

At least 10,000&nbsp;people lost electricity in Louisiana. Furthermore, 130&nbsp;[[boats]] were damaged or sunk at a large [[marina]] in [[Buras, Louisiana]], due to the storm surge of over {{convert|4|ft|m}}, in a matter of minutes.<ref name="cnn91997"/> Both [[Grand Isle, Louisiana|Grand Isle]] and [[Jefferson Parish, Louisiana|Grand Terre Island]] received erosion on their shores.<ref name="cnn92297">{{cite web|author=Charles Zewe, Associated Press|year=1997|title=Danny drifts north, leaving mayhem in its wake|publisher=[[CNN]]|accessdate=2006-12-31|url=http://www.cnn.com/WEATHER/9707/22/danny.early/index.html |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20050212093504/http://www.cnn.com/WEATHER/9707/22/danny.early/index.html |archivedate = 2005-02-12}} Accessed via the [[Internet Archive#Wayback Machine|Wayback Machine]].</ref> Around 160 [[household]]s and 80 [[business]]es reported damage on Grand Isle.

Meanwhile in Plaquemines Parish, ten houses and 35 trailers had damage, with 8 businesses at least partially flooded and 40 commercial fishing boats also damaged. [[Lafourche Parish]] had no significant damage to report.<ref name="usatoday"/> [[Empire, Louisiana|Empire]] and [[Venice, Louisiana|Venice]] had the greatest damage in Plaquemines Parish. Within the hurricane protection levees in the parish, trees, power lines, house roofs, and mobile homes had damage inflicted, as well as the localized flooding that occurred in Plaquemines, after about 10&nbsp;inches of rain. Some highways were flooded, due to storm tides, in lower [[Terrebonne Parish, Louisiana|Terrebonne Parish]], and a few [[roads]] in [[St. Bernard Parish|St. Bernard]] and [[Orleans Parish|Orleans]] parishes, which were outside the hurricane protection [[levees]]. Negligible damage occurred elsewhere in the extreme southeastern portion of Louisiana, due to Danny being a small tropical cyclone and a minimal hurricane.<ref name="NCDClouisiana"/>

Eastern [[Jackson County, Mississippi|Jackson County]] had the greatest impact throughout Mississippi. [[Pascagoula, Mississippi|Pascagoula]] reported a wind gust of 35&nbsp;mph (55&nbsp;km/h) on July 19. Pascagoula airport reported 7.87&nbsp;inches (200&nbsp;mm) of rain from July 17 through July 19. Some streets and a few homes were flooded in far southeastern Jackson County, in areas of poor drainage systems.  The coast of Mississippi had no significant damage according to emergency management officials.<ref name="NCDCmississippi">{{cite web|author=NCDC|year=1997|title=Event Record Details: Hurricane (Mississippi)|publisher=[[National Climatic Data Center]]|accessdate=2007-01-01|url=http://www4.ncdc.noaa.gov/cgi-win/wwcgi.dll?wwevent~ShowEvent~299434}}</ref>

Extreme amounts of rainfall were produced over [[Alabama]].<ref name="tcr"/> Dauphin Island had the highest amount of rainfall, 37.75&nbsp;inches (959&nbsp;mm) reported by the [[Hydrometeorological Prediction Center|HPC]].<ref name="HPCmap">{{cite web|author=Hydrometeorological Prediction Center|year=1997|title=Hurricane Danny Rainfall Totals|publisher=[[National Climatic Data Center]]|accessdate=2007-12-13|url=http://www.hpc.ncep.noaa.gov/tropical/rain/danny1997filledrainblk.gif}}</ref>  Dauphin Island Sea Lab recorded 36.71&nbsp;inches (932&nbsp;mm) of rain, but not all the rain may have recorded in the rain gauge at this location, so it is possible the rainfall may have been underestimated. [[Doppler weather radar]] estimates show that around 43&nbsp;inches (1,090&nbsp;mm) of rain fell off the coast of Dauphin Island. A storm surge of over 6.5&nbsp;feet (1.98&nbsp;m) occurred off [[List of state highways in Alabama|Highway 182]], midway between [[Gulf Shores, Alabama|Gulf Shores]] and [[Fort Morgan, Alabama|Fort Morgan]], in addition to the rainfall. Unusually, when the storm stalled off the coast of Alabama, prevailing northerly winds forced the water out of [[Mobile Bay]], causing tides to be two&nbsp;feet (0.61&nbsp;m) below normal. Observers noted that, with the exception of river [[Channel (geography)|channels]], it would be possible to walk across the bay. In addition, three tornadoes occurred in Alabama, one being in [[Orange Beach, Alabama|Orange Beach]], another in [[Opelika, Alabama|Opelika]], while the other one occurred in [[Alabama Port, Alabama|Alabama Port]].<ref name="tcr"/> There were some other tornadoes that also caused minimal damage.<ref name="alabamatornadoes">{{cite web|author=NWS-Birmingham Internet Services Team|year=2006|title=NWS-Birmingham Internet Services Team|publisher=[[National Weather Service]]|accessdate=2006-12-31|url=http://www.srh.noaa.gov/bmx/tornadoes/1997.php|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20061010104025/http://www.srh.noaa.gov/bmx/tornadoes/1997.php |archivedate = October 10, 2006|deadurl=yes}}</ref>

Despite its effects in the northern [[Gulf of Mexico]], only one person was directly killed from the storm there; a man [[drowning|drowned]] off the coast when he fell off his sailboat near [[Fort Morgan, Alabama]]. One indirect casualty also occurred in the area, when a man had a heart attack while trying to secure a boat off the Alabama coast during the storm.<ref name="tcr"/> Numerous roads became flooded and impassable for several days, south and along [[Interstate 10 in Alabama|I-10]] in [[Mobile County, Alabama|Mobile]], south and central [[Choctaw County, Alabama|Choctaw]], and [[Baldwin County, Alabama|Baldwin]] counties. Along the [[Fowl River|Fowl]] and [[Fish River (Alabama)|Fish]] rivers, in Mobile and Baldwin counties respectively, significant damage to homes occurred due to flooding. Most roads on [[Dauphin Island]] were flooded in over a foot of water. A few homes were close to falling into [[Mobile Bay]], and one home had to be moved backwards towards land to prevent its destruction.<ref name="NCDCalabama">{{cite web|author=NCDC|year=1997|title=Event Record Details: Hurricane (Alabama)|publisher=[[National Climatic Data Center]]|accessdate=2007-01-01|url=http://www4.ncdc.noaa.gov/cgi-win/wwcgi.dll?wwevent~ShowEvent~299512}}</ref> At the peak of the storm in [[Alabama]], at least 44,000&nbsp;people were without power in [[Mobile County, Alabama|Mobile]] and [[Baldwin County, Alabama|Baldwin]] counties.

The heavy rains caused two people to drown in [[Charlotte, North Carolina|Charlotte]]. A girl drowned after being swept into a creek, and a woman drowned while in her car. Four indirect deaths occurred from traffic accidents during the storm's onslaught in Georgia.<ref name="tcr"/> A severe drought had been in place in the [[Mid-Atlantic States]] during the month of July. Copious rainfall amounts helped bring a minor relief to the drought. Sustained tropical-storm force winds affected [[Martha's Vineyard]], [[Nantucket Island]], and parts of [[Cape Cod]], in addition to the coastal waters from the entrance of [[Buzzards Bay]] to the south and east of [[Cape Cod]]. Only minor damage occurred, despite these strong winds, which were experienced primarily in southeastern [[Massachusetts]].<ref name="usatoday"/><ref name="cox">{{cite web|author=|year=1997|title=Tropical Storm Danny Visits Portsmouth!|publisher=|accessdate=2006-12-28|url=http://members.cox.net/wxr/danny97.htm}}</ref> The minor damage included localized flooding, power outages, downed tree limbs, and lost boats. A suspension of [[ferry]] service to Nantucket Island occurred for most of July 25, with a shorter suspension happening on the service to Martha's Vineyard. No significant coastal flooding affected the region, although a storm shelter was opened on [[Nantucket Island]] to host a [[Boy Scouts of America|Boy Scout]] group camping there. Danny was the fifth tropical cyclone to affect [[Southern New England]] in the 20th century during the month of July.<ref name="usatoday"/>

== Aftermath and records ==
Debris remained in the inland waters of [[Alabama]] until at least August 12, 1997. Endangered or threatened [[sea turtles]] lived in these waters and were threatened by the debris. Specialized turtle exclusion devices, known as TED's, or specialized [[Net (device)|nets]] that allowed the turtles to escape them, were required before Danny for shrimp trawlers. The Director of the [[Marine (ocean)|Marine]] Resources Division of the [[Alabama Department of Conservation and Natural Resources]] said that the "inordinate amount of [[debris]] is causing extraordinary difficulty with the performance of (TED's) in these areas." Therefore, the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] allowed an alternative to the TED's, of shorter tow times of a maximum of 55&nbsp;minutes from April 1 through October 31, and a maximum of 75&nbsp;minutes from November 1 through March 31. The EPA intended to minimize any sea turtle casualties as a result of allowing trawlers to remove the TED's.<ref name="epa1">{{cite web|author=National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration|year=1997|title=Sea Turtle Conservation; Shrimp Trawling Requirements|publisher=United States Environmental Protection Agency|accessdate=2006-12-29|url=http://www.epa.gov/fedrgstr/EPA-SPECIES/1997/August/Day-12/e21170.htm}}</ref>

The storm dropped 36.71&nbsp;inches (932&nbsp;mm) of rain on Dauphin Island, setting the new record for the most tropical or subtropical cyclone related rainfall in the state of Alabama, and is among the largest in the [[United States]].<ref name="tcr"/> The storm also became the earliest 5th tropical or subtropical storm of a season when it reached tropical storm strength on July 17. This record was broken in the [[2005 Atlantic hurricane season]] when [[Hurricane Emily (2005)|Hurricane Emily]] first attained tropical storm status on July 12, just five days earlier.{{Hurdat}}
