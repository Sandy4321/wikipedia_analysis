{{otherships|SMS Bayern}}

'''SMS ''Bayern''''' was the lead ship of the {{sclass|Bayern|battleship|5}} [[battleship]] of the [[Kaiserliche Marine|German Imperial Navy]]. Named after the state of [[Bayern]], she was launched in February 1915 and entered service in July 1916, too late to take part in the [[Battle of Jutland]]. Her main armament consisted of eight 38&nbsp;cm (15&nbsp;in) guns in four turrets, which was a significant improvement over the preceding {{sclass|K<U+00F6>nig|battleship|5}}'s ten 30.5&nbsp;cm (12&nbsp;inch) guns. The ship was to have formed the nucleus for a fourth battle squadron in the [[High Seas Fleet]], along with three of her [[sister ship]]s. However, only one of the other ships&mdash;{{SMS|Baden|1915|2}}&mdash;was completed; the other two were canceled later in the war when production requirements shifted to [[U-boat]] construction.

As she had been commissioned late in the war, ''Bayern'' had a limited service career. The first operation in which the ship took part was an abortive fleet advance into the North Sea on 18&ndash;19 August 1916, just a month after she had been commissioned. The ship also participated in [[Operation Albion]] in the [[Gulf of Riga]] in October 1917. However, shortly after the German attack began on 12 October, ''Bayern'' was mined and had to be withdrawn for repairs. She was interned with the majority of the [[High Seas Fleet]] in [[Scapa Flow]] in November 1918 following the end of [[World War I]]. On 21 June 1919, Admiral [[Ludwig von Reuter]] ordered the fleet be scuttled; ''Bayern'' sank at 14:30. In September 1934, the ship was raised and towed to [[Rosyth]], where she was scrapped.

==Construction==
''Bayern'' was ordered under the provisional name "T" in 1912<ref name="Groner28">Gr<U+00F6>ner, p. 28</ref> , under the fourth and final [[German Naval Laws|Naval Law]], which was passed that year.<ref>Herwig, p. 81</ref> Construction began at the [[Howaldtswerke]] Dockyard in [[Kiel]] under construction number 590. The ship was laid down in 1913 and launched on 18 February 1915. After fitting out, sea trials were conducted; the ship was commissioned into on 15 July 1916. She had cost the Imperial German Government 49 million Goldmarks.<ref name="Groner28"/> The first of what were eventually two ships in her class, ''Bayern'' would later be joined in service by {{SMS|Baden|1915|2}}. Two other ships, ''Sachsen'' and ''W<U+00FC>rttemberg'', were canceled before they were completed.<ref name="Groner30">Gr<U+00F6>ner, p. 30</ref>

''Bayern'' was {{convert|179.4|m|ft|abbr=on}} [[length at the waterline|long at the waterline]], and an even {{convert|180|m|ft|abbr=on}} [[length overall|long overall]]. She had a [[draft (hull)|draft]] of between 9.3&ndash;9.4&nbsp;m (30.5&ndash;30.8&nbsp;ft). ''Bayern'' displaced 28,530&nbsp;[[metric tons]] at a standard displacement; at full combat load, she displaced up to 32,200&nbsp;tons. ''Bayern'' was powered by three Parsons [[steam turbine]]s, which was rated at 35,000&nbsp;[[shaft horsepower]], and on trials achieved 55,967&nbsp;shp; she had a maximum speed of 22&nbsp;knots.<ref name="Groner28"/>

She was armed with eight 38&nbsp;cm (15&nbsp;in) guns arranged in four twin gun turrets: two superfiring turrets each fore and aft. ''Bayern'' was the first German warship to feature guns of this caliber.<ref>Hore, p. 70</ref> Her secondary armament consisted of sixteen 15&nbsp;cm (5.9&nbsp;in) guns, six 8.8&nbsp;cm (3.45&nbsp;in) guns and five 60&nbsp;cm (23.6&nbsp;in) underwater torpedo tubes, one in the bow and two on each beam. Upon commissioning, she carried a crew of 42 officers and 1,129 enlisted men.<ref name="Groner30"/>

==Service history==
===Fleet advance of 18&ndash;19 August===
Admiral [[Reinhard Scheer]] planned a fleet advance for 18&ndash;19&nbsp;August; the operation consisted of a bombardment conducted by the [[I Scouting Group]]. This was an attempt to draw out and destroy Admiral [[David Beatty]]'s battlecruisers. As {{SMS|Moltke|1910|2}} and {{SMS|Von der Tann||2}} were the only two remaining German battlecruisers still in fighting condition, three dreadnoughts were assigned to the unit for the operation: ''Bayern'', and the two {{sclass|K<U+00F6>nig|battleship|4}} ships {{SMS|Markgraf||2}} and {{SMS|Gro<U+00DF>er Kurf<U+00FC>rst||2}}. Admiral Scheer and the rest of the High Seas Fleet, with 15 dreadnoughts of its own, would trail behind and provide cover.<ref>Massie, p. 682</ref> The British were aware of the German plans and sortied the Grand Fleet to meet them. By 14:35, Scheer had been warned of the Grand Fleet's approach and, unwilling to engage the whole of the Grand Fleet just 11&nbsp;weeks after the decidedly close call at Jutland, turned his forces around and retreated to German ports.<ref>Massie, p. 683</ref>

===Operation Albion===
{{main|Operation Albion}}
In early September 1917, following the German conquest of the Russian port of [[Riga]], the German navy decided to evict the Russian naval forces that still held the [[Gulf of Riga]]. To this end, the ''Admiralstab'' (the Navy High Command) planned an operation to seize the Baltic islands of [[Saaremaa|<U+00D6>sel]], particularly the Russian gun batteries on the [[S<U+00F5>rve Peninsula|Sworbe peninsula]].<ref>Halpern, p. 213</ref> On 18 September, the order was issued for a joint Army-Navy operation to capture <U+00D6>sel and [[Muhu|Moon]] islands; the primary naval component was to comprise the [[flagship]], the battlecruiser {{SMS|Moltke|1910|2}}, along with the III Battle Squadron of the High Seas Fleet. The V Division included the four {{sclass|K<U+00F6>nig|battleship|6}}s, and had been by this time joined by ''Bayern''. The VI Division consisted of the five {{sclass|Kaiser|battleship|6}}s. Along with several 9 light cruisers, 3 torpedo boat flotillas, and dozens of [[naval mine|mine]] warfare ships, the entire force numbered some 300 ships, and were supported by over 100 aircraft and 6 zeppelins. The invasion force amounted to approximately 24,600 officers and enlisted men.<ref>Halpern, pp. 214&ndash;215</ref> Opposing the Germans were the old Russian [[pre-dreadnought]]s [[Russian battleship Slava|''Slava'']] and [[Russian battleship Tsesarevich|''Tsarevitch'']], the [[armored cruiser]]s ''Bayan'', ''Admiral Makarov'', and ''Diana'', 26 destroyers, and several torpedo boats and gunboats. The garrison on <U+00D6>sel numbered some 14,000 men.<ref name="Halpern215">Halpern, p. 215</ref>

The operation began on 12 October, when ''Bayern'', along with ''Moltke'' and the four ''K<U+00F6>nig''s began firing on the Russian shore batteries at Tagga Bay. Simultaneously, the ''Kaiser''s engaged the batteries on the Sworbe peninsula; the objective was to secure the channel between Moon and [[Hiiumaa|Dag<U+00F6>]] islands, which would block the only escape route of the Russian ships in the gulf. While moving into her bombardment position, ''Bayern'' struck a [[naval mine]]. The ship was severely damaged, and temporary repairs proved ineffective. ''Bayern'' had to be withdrawn to Kiel for repairs; the return trip took 19 days. ''Bayern''{{'}}s involvement with Operation Albion had come to an abrupt end.<ref name="Halpern215"/> During repairs, the forward torpedo tube room was removed and turned into a [[watertight compartment]].<ref name="Groner30"/>

===Fate===
[[File:SMS Bayern sinking.jpg|thumb|upright|right|''Bayern'' sinking in Scapa Flow]]

''Bayern'' was to have taken part in what would have amounted to the "death ride" of the High Seas Fleet shortly before the end of World War I. The bulk of the High Seas Fleet was to have sortied from their base in Wilhelmshaven to engage the British Grand Fleet; [[Reinhard Scheer|Scheer]]&mdash;by now the ''[[Grand Admiral|Gro<U+00DF>admiral]]'' of the fleet&mdash;intended to inflict as much damage as possible on the British navy, in order to retain a better bargaining position for Germany, whatever the cost to the fleet.<ref>Tarrant, pp. 280&ndash;281</ref> While the fleet was consolidating in Wilhelmshaven, war-weary sailors began rioting.<ref name="Massie775">Massie, p. 775</ref> On 24 October 1918, the order was given to sail from Wilhelmshaven. Starting on the night of 29 October, sailors on several battleships [[Wilhelmshaven mutiny|mutinied]]; three ships from the III&nbsp;Squadron refused to weigh anchors, and acts of sabotage were committed on board the battleships {{SMS|Th<U+00FC>ringen||2}} and {{SMS|Helgoland||2}}. The order to sail was rescinded in the face of this open revolt.<ref>Tarrant, pp. 281&ndash;282</ref> In an attempt to suppress the mutiny, the battleship squadrons were dispersed.<ref name="Massie775"/>

Following the capitulation of Germany in November 1918, the majority of the High Seas Fleet was to be interned in the British naval base in [[Scapa Flow]].<ref>Tarrant, p. 282</ref> ''Bayern'' was listed as one of the ships to be handed over. On 21 November 1918, the ships to be interned, under the command of Rear Admiral [[Ludwig von Reuter]], sailed from their base in Germany for the last time. The fleet rendezvoused with the British [[light cruiser]] {{HMS|Cardiff||2}}, before meeting a massive flotilla of some 370 British, American, and French warships for the voyage to Scapa Flow.<ref>Herwig, pp. 254&ndash;255</ref>

The fleet remained in captivity during the negotiations that ultimately produced the [[Versailles Treaty]]. It became apparent to Reuter that the British intended to seize the German ships on 21 June, which was the deadline for Germany to have signed the peace treaty. Unaware that the deadline had been extended to the 23rd, Reuter ordered his ships be sunk. On the morning of 21 June, the British fleet left Scapa Flow to conduct training maneuvers; at 11:20 Reuter transmitted the order to his ships.<ref>Herwig, p. 256</ref>''Bayern'' sank at 14:30. The ship was raised on 1 September 1934 and was broken up the following year in [[Rosyth]]. The ship's bell was delivered to the German [[German Navy|Federal Navy]] and is on displace at Kiel F<U+00F6>rdeklub.<ref name="Groner30"/>
