The '''[[Taxonomy|taxonomic history]] of [[lemur]]s''' dates back to 1758 when [[Carl Linnaeus]] first [[Biological classification|classified]] them, and the taxonomy remains controversial today, with approximately 70 to 100&nbsp;[[species]] and [[subspecies]] recognized, depending on [[Species problem|how the term "species" is defined]].  Having undergone [[Evolutionary history of lemurs|their own independent evolution]] on Madagascar, lemurs have diversified to fill many [[Ecological niche|niches]] normally filled by other types of mammals.  They include the smallest primates in the world, and once included some of the largest.  Since the arrival of humans approximately 2,000&nbsp;years ago, lemurs have become restricted to 10% of the island, or approximately {{convert|60000|km2|sqmi}}, and many face [[extinction]].  Concerns over [[Lemur#Conservation|lemur conservation]] have affected lemur taxonomy, since distinct species receive increased conservation attention compared to subspecies.

The relationship between the [[aye-aye]] and the rest of the lemurs has had the greatest impact on lemur taxonomy at the [[Family (biology)|family]] rank and above.  Genetic analysis of this relationship has also clarified lemur [[Phylogenetics|phylogeny]] and supports the hypothesis that lemurs [[Oceanic dispersal|rafted]] to Madagascar.  Despite general agreement on phylogeny, the taxonomy is still under debate. At the [[genus]] level, the taxonomy has been relatively stable since 1931, but a number of additional genera have been recognized since then.

Since the 1990s, there has been a steep increase in the number of [[List of lemur species|recognized lemur species and subspecies]] through the discovery of new species, the elevation of existing subspecies to full species status, and the recognition of new species among previously known populations that were not even distinct subspecies.  Currently living lemur species are divided into five families and 15&nbsp;genera.  If the extinct [[subfossil lemur]]s are included, three families, eight genera, and 17&nbsp;species would be added to the count.  The recent rise in species numbers is due to both improved genetic analysis and a push in conservation to encourage the protection of isolated and distinct lemur populations.  Not everyone in the scientific community supports these taxonomic changes, with some preferring instead an estimate of 50&nbsp;living species.

==Background==
[[Image:Microcebus murinus -Artis Zoo, Amsterdam, Netherlands-8a.jpg|thumb|right|alt=A tiny, mouse-like lemur clings to a nearly vertical branch while looking down with its large eyes.|The [[mouse lemur]]s are the smallest primates in the world and also one of the most speciose of lemur genera.]]
Since their arrival on Madagascar, a [[biogeography|biogeographically]] isolated island with a unique mammalian fauna, lemurs have diversified both in behavior and morphology.  Their diversity rivals that of the monkeys and apes found throughout the rest of the world, especially when the recently extinct [[subfossil lemur]]s are considered.{{Sfn|Garbutt|2007|pp=85<U+2013>86}} Ranging in size from the {{convert|30|g|oz|abbr=on}} [[Madame Berthe's mouse lemur]], probably the world's smallest primate,{{LoM3 Sfn|p=124}} to the extinct {{convert|160|<U+2013>|200|kg|lb|abbr=on}} ''[[Archaeoindris fontoynonti]]'', the largest known [[prosimian]],{{LoM3 Sfn|p=37}}{{Sfn|Godfrey|Jungers|Burney|2010|p=356}}{{Sfn|Vuillaume-Randriamanantena|1988|p=379}} lemurs evolved diverse forms of locomotion, varying levels of social complexity, and unique adaptations to the local climate.  They went on to fill many niches normally occupied by monkeys, [[squirrel]]s, [[woodpecker]]s, and large grazing [[ungulate]]s.{{Sfn|Preston-Mafham|1991|pp=141<U+2013>188}}{{Sfn|Sussman|2003|p=110}}  In addition to the incredible diversity between lemur families, there has also been great diversification among closely related lemurs.{{Sfn|Garbutt|2007|pp=85<U+2013>86}}

The arrival of humans on the island 1,500 to 2,000&nbsp;years ago has taken a significant toll, not only on the size of lemur populations, but also on their diversity.{{Sfn|Sussman|2003|p=110}}  Due to [[habitat destruction]] and hunting, at least 17&nbsp;species and 8&nbsp;genera have gone extinct and many others have become threatened.{{LoM3 Sfn|pp=1, 27}}  Historically, lemurs ranged across the entire island inhabiting a wide variety of habitats, including [[Madagascar dry deciduous forests|dry deciduous forests]], [[Madagascar lowland forests|lowland forests]], [[Madagascar spiny thickets|spiny thickets]], [[Madagascar subhumid forests|subhumid forests]], [[Cloud forest|montane forest]], and [[mangrove]].  Today, their collective range is restricted to 10% of the island, or approximately {{convert|60000|km2|mi2|abbr=on}}.{{LoM2 Sfn|p=17}}  Most of the remaining forests and lemurs are found along the periphery of the island.  The center of the island, the [[Central Highlands (Madagascar)|Hauts-Plateaux]], was converted by early settlers to [[Paddy field|rice paddies]] and [[grassland]] through [[Slash and burn|slash-and-burn agriculture]], known locally as ''tavy''.  As [[erosion]] depleted the soil, the cyclical forest regrowth and burning ended as the forest gradually failed to return.{{Sfn|Preston-Mafham|1991|pp=18<U+2013>21}}  In 2008, 41% of all lemur taxa were threatened with extinction while 42% were classified on the [[IUCN Red List]] as "[[Data Deficient]]".{{LoM3 Sfn|p=1}}

==Overview of taxonomic and phylogenetic classification==
[[File:Linnaeus1758-title-page.jpg|left|upright=0.6|thumb|alt=A book cover with the text "Caroli Linnaei Equitis de Stella Polari, Archiatri Regii, Med. & Botan. Profess. Upsal.; Acad. Upsal.

Laurentii Salvii, 1758."|Lemurs were first formally classified in the [[10th edition of Systema Naturae|10th edition of ''Systema Naturae'']].]]
In the first volume of the [[10th edition of Systema Naturae|10th edition of ''Systema Naturae'']] (1758), [[Carl Linnaeus]], the founder of modern [[binomial nomenclature]], created the genus ''Lemur'' to include three species: ''Lemur tardigradus'' (the [[red slender loris]], now known as ''Loris tardigradus''), ''Lemur catta'' (the [[ring-tailed lemur]]), and ''Lemur volans'' (the [[Philippine flying lemur|Philippine colugo]], now known as ''Cynocephalus volans'').{{Sfn|Linnaeus|1758|pp=29<U+2013>30}}  Although the term "lemur" was apparently at first intended for [[loris]]es, it was soon applied to the [[endemism|endemic]] Malagasy primates, which have been known as "lemurs" ever since.{{Sfn|Tattersall|1982|pp=43<U+2013>44}} The name derives from the [[Latin]] term ''[[lemures]]'', which refers to the "spirits of the dead" from [[Roman mythology]].{{Sfn|Garbutt|2007|pp=85<U+2013>86}}  Linnaeus was familiar with the nocturnal habits and ghost-like appearance of lemurs and lorises,{{Sfn|Flower|Lydekker|1891|p=682}} as well as their noiseless movements at night, [[Tapetum lucidum|reflective eyes]], and ghostly cries. He may also have known about Malagasy legends that lemurs are the souls of their ancestors.{{Sfn|Nield|2007|p=41}} Being familiar with the works of [[Virgil]] and [[Ovid]] and seeing an analogy that fit with his naming scheme, Linnaeus adapted the term "lemur" for these nocturnal primates.{{Sfn|Blunt|Stearn|2002|p=252}}

Since the first taxonomic [[biological classification|classification]] of lemurs, many changes have been made to lemur taxonomy.  Within the primate order, [[treeshrew]]s (order Scandentia) were considered basal, prosimian primates<U+2014>close relatives of lemurs<U+2014>until the 1980s.{{Sfn|Rowe|1996|p=13}} [[Colugo]]s, also incorrectly referred to as "flying lemurs", were once considered lemur-like primates, but were reclassified as close relatives of bats,{{Sfn|Rowe|1996|p=27}} and more recently as close relatives of primates within their own order, Dermoptera.{{Sfn|Jane<U+010D>ka|Miller|Pringle|Wiens|2007}}  Primates, together with their closest relatives, the treeshrews, colugos, and long-extinct [[Plesiadapiformes|plesiadapiform]]s, form the taxonomically unranked [[Euarchonta]] [[clade]] within the [[Euarchontoglires]]. [[Lorisidae|Lorisids]], some of which were originally placed in the genus ''Lemur'' by Carl Linnaeus, have since been moved into either their own infraorder (Lorisiformes) or their own superfamily (Lorisoidea) within Lemuriformes.{{MSW3 Sfn|Groves|id=12100002|heading=Strepsirrini}}{{Sfn|Godinot|2006|p=446}}

For the Malagasy primate fauna, taxonomic nomenclature proliferated during the 1800s, with the aid of museum [[systematics|systematists]], such as [[Albert G<U+00FC>nther]] and [[John Edward Gray]], as well as naturalists and explorers, such as [[Alfred Grandidier]].{{Sfn|Jolly|Sussman|2006|p=25}}{{LoM3 Sfn|pp=48<U+2013>49}}  This nomenclature was not sorted out until decades later, when [[Ernst Schwarz]] standardized it in 1931.{{LoM3 Sfn|p=49}}{{Sfn|Schwarz|1931}}  It was not until the 1990s that this nomenclature started to see a new wave of taxonomic change.{{Sfn|Tattersall|2007|p=14}}

Since the 19th century, the classification of lemurs above the genus level has seen many changes. Early taxonomists proposed a variety of classifications for lemurs, but generally separated indriids from other lemurs and placed the aye-aye in a major group of its own; some classified the dwarf and mouse lemurs with the galagos.{{Sfn|Tattersall|1982|pp=246<U+2013>247}} In 1915, [[William King Gregory]] published a classification{{Sfn|Gregory|1915}} that remained generally accepted over the next decades. He placed all the lemurs together in a "series" Lemuriformes and recognized three families: Daubentoniidae, Indriidae, and Lemuridae (including the current Cheirogaleidae and Lepilemuridae).{{Sfn|Tattersall|1982|pp=246<U+2013>247}} [[George Gaylord Simpson]]'s influential 1945 classification of mammals placed the [[treeshrew]]s and the fossil ''[[Anagale]]'' (both now classified outside Primates) inside Lemuriformes and classified the fossil families [[Plesiadapidae]] and [[Adapidae]] in a superfamily Lemuroidea with most of the lemurs.{{Sfn|Simpson|1945|pp=61<U+2013>62}}

Although treeshrews, plesiadapids, and the like are now no longer considered to be closely related to lemurs, disagreements persist over the classification of lemurs and related groups, resulting in two competing arrangements of the [[taxonomic rank|infraorders and superfamilies]] within Strepsirrhini. Colin Groves, in the 2005 third edition of ''[[Mammal Species of the World]]'', classifies living strepsirrhines under three infraorders and two superfamilies.  This places the aye-aye within its own infraorder, separate from both lemurs (divided into two superfamilies) and lorises.{{MSW3 Sfn|Groves|id=12100002|heading=Strepsirrini}}  Since the publication of ''Mammal Species of the World'', there has been little support in the academic literature for placing the aye-aye in its own infraorder, and more recently Mittermeier, Groves, and other editors have ignored this taxonomic level.{{Sfn|Mittermeier|Ganzhorn|Konstant|Glander|2008}}  An alternative classification draws the lines for infraorders and superfamilies differently, though using the same general [[phylogenetic tree]].  It classifies all living strepsirrhines under one infraorder, with the lorises and lemurs in separate superfamilies.{{Sfn|Godinot|2006|p=446}}

The classification of several lemur taxa has elicited particular debate. Most significantly, the placement of the aye-aye has been controversial since its introduction to Western science in 1782, and it has been a topic of debate until very recently.{{Sfn|Garbutt|2007|pp=85<U+2013>86}}{{Sfn|Tattersall|1982|pp=246<U+2013>247}}{{Sfn|Sterling|McCreless|2006|pp=159<U+2013>160}}  Arguing against [[Charles Darwin|Darwin]]'s theory of [[natural selection]], [[Richard Owen]] claimed in 1863 that the aye-aye's distinct characteristics, including its ever-growing [[incisor]]s and unique, highly flexible middle finger, are so perfectly adapted for their uses in extractive [[foraging]] that they could not have evolved gradually through natural selection.{{Sfn|Sterling|McCreless|2006|p=159}}  More recently, the aye-aye's placement has posed problems for the rafting hypothesis for the primate colonization of Madagascar.  If this species does not form a [[Monophyly|monophyletic group]] with the rest of the lemurs, then multiple colonization events would have had to occur to explain the occurrence of lemurs on Madagascar.{{Sfn|Garbutt|2007|pp=85<U+2013>86}}

[[File:Aye-Aye (Chiromys madagascariensis).png|thumb|left|alt=Aye-aye (a lemuriform primate with large head, ears, and eyes; black, wiry fur; long, bushy tail; and hands with one unusually thin and long middle finger) perched on a branch|The [[aye-aye]] has traditionally been difficult to classify due to its unique physical traits.]]
Until Owen published a definitive anatomical study in 1866, early naturalists were uncertain whether the aye-aye (genus ''Daubentonia'') was a [[primate]], [[rodent]], or [[marsupial]].{{Sfn|Sterling|McCreless|2006|pp=159<U+2013>160}}{{Sfn|Ankel-Simons|2007|pp=257}}{{Sfn|Garbutt|2007|pp=205<U+2013>207}}{{Sfn|Owen|1866|p=36}}  In the late eighteenth century, for example, the aye-aye was classified under the squirrel genus ''[[Sciurus]]''.{{Sfn|Elliot|1907|p=552}}  By emphasizing its primate features, such as its [[postorbital bar]], [[Stereopsis|stereoscopic vision]], and [[thumb|opposable hallux]], over its rodent-like teeth, Owen demonstrated its affinity with other primates.{{Sfn|Sterling|McCreless|2006|pp=159<U+2013>160}}{{Sfn|Owen|1866|p=96}}  In 1996, Ankel-Simons demonstrated that the shape and arrangement of the aye-aye's diminutive [[deciduous tooth|deciduous incisors]] indicate that this genus has a shared ancestry with the [[toothcomb]]ed primates.{{Sfn|Simons|1997|p=144}}  However, the placement of the aye-aye within the primates remained problematic until very recently.  The [[karyotype]] of the aye-aye is noticeably different from that of its closest relatives, the lorises and the rest of the lemurs, with a [[Ploidy#Diploid|diploid]] [[chromosome]] count of 2n=30.{{Sfn|Ankel-Simons|2007|p=544}}  Based on its anatomy, researchers have found support for classifying the genus ''Daubentonia'' as a specialized [[Indriidae|indriid]], a [[Cladistics|sister group]] to all strepsirrhines, and an indeterminate taxon within the primates.{{Sfn|Yoder|2003|p=1242}} In 1931, Schwarz labeled the aye-aye as an offshoot of Indriidae, claiming that all lemurs were monophyletic,{{Sfn|Schwarz|1931|p=400}} whereas [[Reginald Innes Pocock]] had previously placed the aye-aye outside of the lemurs.{{Sfn|Pocock|1918|pp=51<U+2013>52}}  In that same year, Anthony and Coupin classified the aye-aye under infraorder Chiromyiformes, a sister group to the other strepsirrhines.  Colin Groves upheld this classification in 2005 because he was not entirely convinced the aye-aye formed a clade with the rest of the Malagasy lemurs,{{MSW3 Sfn|Groves|id=12100096|heading=Chiromyiformes}} despite molecular tests that had shown Daubentoniidae was basal to all Lemuriformes.{{Sfn|Yoder|2003|p=1243}}

Another interpretation of the aye-aye's origins has once again called into question the single origins of the lemurs.  The aye-aye and a fossil strepsirrhine primate from Africa, ''[[Plesiopithecus]]'', share similarities in the shape of the skull and the morphology of the lower jaw, which suggest that the latter could be a primitive relative of the aye-aye.  However, the placement of an aye-aye ancestor in Africa would require multiple colonizations of Madagascar by strepsirrhine primates.  Molecular tests may offer support, since they show that the aye-aye was the first to diverge in the lemur clade and that the other lemur families did not diverge until much later.{{Sfn|Godinot|2006|p=457<U+2013>458}}{{Sfn|Chatterjee|Ho|Barnes|Groves|2009|pp=3, 5}}

Often classified with the galagos by early students, the cheirogaleids (dwarf and mouse lemurs) were placed with the other lemurs from Gregory's 1915 classification until the early 1970s, when several anthropologists proposed that they were more closely related to lorisiforms, based on morphological data.{{Sfn|Tattersall|1982|pp=246<U+2013>247}}{{Sfn|Groves|2001|p=55}} However, relevant genetic studies unanimously place cheirogaleids within the lemuriform clade and Groves himself, who had promoted the cheirogaleid-lorisiform relationship in a 1974 paper, by 2001 regarded the idea as refuted.{{Sfn|Yoder|2003|pp=1242<U+2013>1243}}{{Sfn|Groves|2001|p=55}}

Classifications in the first half of the 20th century divided lemurs into three families: Daubentoniidae, Indriidae, and Lemuridae, with the latter including the current Cheirogaleidae and Lepilemuridae.{{Sfn|Tattersall|1982|pp=246<U+2013>247}} Because of concerns that Lemuridae might not be monophyletic, the family was later split; in 1982 Tattersall separated the Cheirogaleidae for the dwarf lemurs, mouse lemurs and relatives, and the Lepilemuridae for the sportive lemurs and bamboo lemurs (including the [[greater bamboo lemur]]).{{Sfn|Tattersall|1982|p=263}} This classification is still used, except that the bamboo lemurs were moved back to Lemuridae.{{Sfn|Mittermeier|Ganzhorn|Konstant|Glander|2008|p=1628}}{{MSW3 Sfn|Groves}}

From the 1970s to the 1990s, there have been suggestions that the ruffed lemurs might be related to indriids or a sister group to Lemuridae and Indriidae and that the bamboo lemurs are related to the sportive lemurs,{{Sfn|Groves|2001|pp=54<U+2013>55}} but neither view is supported by molecular phylogeny.{{Sfn|Horvath|Weisrock|Embry|Fiorentino|2008|loc=fig. 1}} The sportive lemurs and the extinct [[koala lemur]]s (Megaladapidae) both lack upper incisors in the permanent dentition,{{Sfn|Ankel-Simons|2007|p=248}}{{Sfn|Godfrey|Jungers|2002|p=112}} and in 1981, Groves placed both together in the family Megaladapidae, which he renamed Lepilemuridae in 2005 because that older name [[Principle of Priority|takes precedence]].{{MSW3 Sfn|Groves|id=12100065|heading=Lepilemuridae}} Genetic research does not support a close relationship between the sportive and koala lemurs and instead places the koala lemurs as a sister group to Lemuridae; therefore, the two are now placed in separate families (Lepilemuridae for the sportive lemurs and Megaladapidae for the koala lemurs).{{Sfn|Orlando|Calvignac|Schnebelen|Douady|2008}}{{Sfn|Garbutt|2007|p=115}}{{Sfn|Karanth|Delefosse|Rakotosamimanana|Parsons|2005|p=5094}} The [[sloth lemur]]s (Palaeopropithecidae) and [[monkey lemur]]s (Archaeolemuridae) were classified as subfamilies within Indriidae as late as 1982,{{Sfn|Tattersall|1982|p=263}} but are now recognized as separate families.{{Sfn|Orlando|Calvignac|Schnebelen|Douady|2008|p=2}}

The relationships among the families of lemurs have been problematic and have yet to be definitively resolved.  Two competing [[phylogenetics|phylogenies]] exist based on genetic and molecular data.  One approach (Horvath ''et&nbsp;al''.) looks at a larger number of genes, but among fewer species.  This results in Lemuridae being a sister group to Lepilemuridae, Cheirogaleidae, and Indriidae.{{Sfn|Horvath|Weisrock|Embry|Fiorentino|2008|loc=fig. 1}}  The other approach (Orlando ''et&nbsp;al''.) looks at fewer genes, but more lemur species.  Using this analysis, Lepilemuridae becomes the sister group to Lemuridae, Cheirogaleidae, and Indriidae.{{Sfn|Orlando|Calvignac|Schnebelen|Douady|2008|loc=fig. 1}} Both phylogenies agree that the Malagasy primates are monophyletic and that Daubentoniidae (the aye-aye) is basal to the lemuriform clade, having split off significantly earlier than the other families.{{Sfn|Yoder|2003|p=1243}}{{Sfn|Horvath|Weisrock|Embry|Fiorentino|2008|loc=fig. 1}}{{Sfn|Orlando|Calvignac|Schnebelen|Douady|2008|loc=fig. 1}}  However, two problems create complications for both approaches.  First, the four most closely related living lemur families diverged within a narrow window of approximately 10&nbsp;million years, making it much harder to distinguish the splits with molecular evidence.  In addition, these families diverged from their last common ancestor approximately 42&nbsp;mya; such distant splits create a lot of [[Statistical noise|noise]] for molecular techniques.{{Sfn|Yoder|Yang|2004|p=768}}

==Genus-level classification==
[[File:Babakotia radofilai.jpg|thumb|right|alt=A giant lemur hangs from a tree limb by all four feet like a slow-moving sloth. The tail is short, and the arms are slightly longer than the legs.|The naming of the extinct ''[[Babakotia|Babakotia radofilai]]'' in 1990 added another genus to the list of subfossil lemurs.]]
Early distribution of lemur species among genera differed in a number of ways from current taxonomy. For example, the [[fork-marked lemur]]s were initially placed in ''Lemur'' and then in ''Microcebus'' with the mouse lemurs before being placed in their own genus ''Phaner'',{{Sfn|Schwarz|1931|p=406}}{{Sfn|Garbutt|2007|p=111}}{{MSW3 Sfn|Groves|id=12100027|heading=''Phaner''}}{{Sfn|Groves|2001|pp=65<U+2013>66}} and [[Charles Immanuel Forsyth Major]] split the ''Cheirogaleus medius'' species group of the dwarf lemurs into a separate genus ''Opolemur'', but this was not accepted.{{Sfn|Schwarz|1931|p=404}}{{Sfn|Groves|2001|pp=65<U+2013>66}} Genus-level taxonomy was largely stabilized by Schwarz in 1931,{{Sfn|Schwarz|1931}} but a number of later changes have become accepted:

* The [[ring-tailed lemur]], [[ruffed lemur]]s,  and true lemurs were once grouped together in the genus ''Lemur'' due to a host of morphological similarities.  For instance, the skeletons of the ring-tailed lemur and the true lemurs are nearly indistinguishable.{{Sfn|Garbutt|2007|p=146}} However, ruffed lemurs were reassigned to the genus ''Varecia'' in 1962,{{MSW3 Sfn|Groves|id=12100059|heading=''Varecia''}} and due to similarities between the ring-tailed lemur and the bamboo lemurs, particularly in regards to molecular evidence and scent gland similarities, the brown lemurs were moved to the genus ''Eulemur'' in 1988.{{Sfn|Garbutt|2007|p=146}}{{LoM3 Sfn|p=315}}{{MSW3 Sfn|Groves| id = 12100034 | heading = ''Eulemur''}} The genus ''Lemur'' is now [[monotypic]], containing only the ring-tailed lemur.
* In 2001,  Colin Groves concluded that despite similarities, the greater bamboo lemur was sufficiently distinct from the [[bamboo lemur]]s of the genus ''Hapalemur'' to merit its own monotypic genus, ''Prolemur'',{{Sfn|Garbutt|2007|p=144}}{{MSW3 Sfn|Groves| id = 12100057 | heading = ''Prolemur''}}  in contrast to Schwarz's 1931 disagreement with Pocock's decision to separate ''Prolemur'' from ''Hapalemur''.{{Sfn|Schwarz|1931|p=407}}
* Originally placed in the genus ''Microcebus'' ([[mouse lemur]]s), the [[giant mouse lemur]] was moved to its own genus, ''Mirza'', in 1985 due to its larger size, morphological differences, dental characteristics, and behavior.{{Sfn|Garbutt|2007|p=108}}{{MSW3 Sfn|Groves| id = 12100025 | heading = ''Mirza''}}
* The [[hairy-eared dwarf lemur]] was first placed in the genus ''Cheirogaleus'' ([[dwarf lemur]]s)  in 1875 and was later found to have closer affinities with ''Microcebus''.  However, its dentition and cranium structure were held sufficiently distinct to merit elevation to its own genus, ''Allocebus''.{{Sfn|Garbutt|2007|p=108}}{{MSW3 Sfn|Groves| id = 12100006 | heading = ''Allocebus''}}
* In 1948, paleontologist [[Charles Lamberton]] proposed a new sub-genus for the giant ruffed lemurs, ''[[Pachylemur]]'', which had previously been placed in the genus ''Lemur''.  Since the 1960s, it has been considered its own separate genus, although the two extinct species of giant ruffed lemur have sometimes been grouped under ''Varecia'' with their closest relatives.{{Sfn|Godfrey|Jungers|2002|p=105}}
* A new genus of [[sloth lemur]], ''[[Babakotia]]'' was named in 1990.{{Sfn|Godfrey|Jungers|2002|p=102}}

==Species-level classification==
{{mainlist|List of lemur species}}
There is widespread disagreement on aspects of species-level lemur taxonomy, particularly concerning the recent increase in the number of recognized species.{{Sfn|Tattersall|2007|pp=21<U+2013>22}}{{Sfn|Yoder|2007|p=866}}{{Sfn|Groeneveld|Weisrock|Rasoloarison|Yoder|2009|pp=2<U+2013>3, 12}}  According to [[Russell Mittermeier]], the president of [[Conservation International]] (CI), taxonomist [[Colin Groves]], and others, there are currently 101&nbsp;recognized species or subspecies of extant lemur, divided into five families and 15&nbsp;genera.{{LoM3 Sfn|pp=100<U+2013>103}}  Conversely, other experts in the field label this as a possible example of [[taxonomic inflation]],{{Sfn|Tattersall|2007|pp=12, 21<U+2013>22}} and prefer instead an estimate of at least 50 species.{{Sfn|Yoder|2007|p=866}}  All sides generally agree that the recently extinct subfossil lemurs should be classified in three [[family (biology)|families]], eight [[genus|genera]], and 17&nbsp;species.{{Sfn|Gommery|Ramanivosoa|Tombomiadana-Raveloson|Randrianantenaina|2009}}{{LoM3 Sfn|p=34}}

[[Image:P verreauxi Grandidier.jpg|thumb|upright|left|alt=Drawing of a medium-sized lemur<U+2014>a sifaka<U+2014>with a dark crown clings vertically to a tree.|Many subspecies have been promoted to species status, yielding nine species for the genus ''Propithecus''.]]
Over the past two decades, the number of recognized lemur species has more than tripled according to some experts.  In 1994, 32&nbsp;distinct species were named in the first edition of [[Conservation International]]'s field guide, ''[[Lemurs of Madagascar (book)|Lemurs of Madagascar]]'',{{LoM1 Sfn|p=51}} and 68&nbsp;were described in the 2nd edition, published in 2006.{{LoM2 Sfn|pp=54<U+2013>55}}  In December 2008, Russell Mittermeier, Colin Groves, and other experts co-wrote an article in the ''International Journal of Primatology'' classifying 99&nbsp;species and subspecies.{{Sfn|Mittermeier|Ganzhorn|Konstant|Glander|2008|p=1608}}  In late 2010, the 3rd edition of ''Lemurs of Madagascar'' listed 101&nbsp;taxa.{{LoM3 Sfn|p=68}}  The number of lemur species is likely to continue growing in the coming years, as [[Field study|field studies]], [[Cytogenetics|cytogenetic]] and [[Molecular genetics|molecular genetic]] research continues, particularly on [[cryptic species]], such as mouse lemurs, which cannot be distinguished visually.{{Sfn|Yoder|2007|pp=866<U+2013>867}}

This threefold increase in less than two decades has not had universal support among taxonomists and lemur researchers.  In many cases, classifications ultimately depends upon which [[Species#Definitions of species|species concept]] is used. Due to the critical condition that most Malagasy primate populations are in, [[Taxonomy|taxonomists]] and [[conservation movement|conservationists]] sometimes favor splitting them into separate species to develop an effective strategy for the conservation of the full range of lemur diversity.{{Sfn|Yoder|2007|p=866}}{{Sfn|Mittermeier|Ganzhorn|Konstant|Glander|2008|pp=1609<U+2013>1614}} Implicitly, this means that full species status will help grant genetically distinct populations added environmental protection.{{Sfn|Yoder|2007|p=866}}

The first large wave of new lemur species descriptions came in 2000, when Colin Groves split two species of [[dwarf lemur]] (''Cheirogaleus'') into seven species{{Sfn|Groves|2000|p=943}} while [[Rodin Rasoloarison]] and colleagues recognized seven species of mouse lemur in western Madagascar.{{Sfn|Rasoloarison|Goodman|Ganzhorn|2000|p=963}}  Then in 2001, Colin Groves elevated the [[red ruffed lemur]] (''Varecia rubra''),{{Sfn|Garbutt|2007|p=170}}{{MSW3 Sfn|Groves| id = 12100060 | heading = ''Varecia rubra''}} five subspecies of brown lemur (''Eulemur albifrons'', ''E.&nbsp;albocollaris'', ''E.&nbsp;collaris'', ''E.&nbsp;rufus'' and ''E.&nbsp;sanfordi''),{{MSW3 Sfn|Groves| id = 12100040 | heading = ''Eulemur fulvus''}} and four subspecies of [[sifaka]] (''Propithecus coquereli'', ''P.&nbsp;deckenii'', ''P.&nbsp;edwardsi'', and ''P.&nbsp;perrieri'') to full species status.{{MSW3 Sfn|Groves| id = 12100084 | heading = ''Propithecus''}}  Additional elevations of all remaining subspecies within the ''Eulemur'' and ''Propithecus'' genera were made in the years that followed.{{LoM3 Sfn|p=377}}{{Sfn|Garbutt|2007|pp=149, 182}}  These and subsequent changes in taxonomy were largely due to a shift to the [[phylogenetic species concept]],{{Sfn|Thalmann|2006}} and are not universally endorsed.{{Sfn|Tattersall|2007|pp=19<U+2013>20}}

By far the most explosive growth in species numbers (in absolute terms) has been in the genera ''Microcebus'' and ''Lepilemur''. In 2006, 15&nbsp;new species of ''Lepilemur'' were described, with three new species reported in February,{{Sfn|Andriaholinirina|Fausser|Roos|Zinner|2006}} one in June,{{Sfn|Rabarivola|Zaramody|Fausser|Andriaholinirina|2006}} and 11 in September.{{Sfn|Louis|Engberg|Lei|Geng|2006}}  Since then, three additional species have been described, one of which turned out to be identical to a previously described species.{{Sfn|Mittermeier|Ganzhorn|Konstant|Glander|2008|pp=1624, 1628}} Genetic and morphological differences seem to suggest that they are cryptic species, but there is still debate whether these merit full species status or should be regarded as subspecies of previously identified, "core" species.{{Sfn|Tattersall|2007|p=18}}{{Sfn|Garbutt|2007|p=115}}

[[Image:Lepilemur sahamalazensis c.png|thumb|right|alt=A sportive lemur (small body, long legs, brown fur, large eyes, and thick, furry tail) clings to the side of a tree, with its head turned towards the camera.|The [[Sahamalaza sportive lemur]] (''Lepilemur sahamalazensis'') was one of many new sportive lemur species identified in the 2000s.]]
Both true lemurs and mouse lemurs were initially divided into a small number of species, either with no distinguishable [[subspecies]] (in the case of mouse lemurs){{Sfn|Yoder|Yang|2004|p=769<U+2013>770}} or with several distinguishable subspecies (in the case of true lemurs).{{Sfn|Johnson|2006|pp=188<U+2013>189}}  With molecular research suggesting a more distant split in both genera, these subspecies or undistinguished populations have been promoted to species status.{{Sfn|Yoder|Yang|2004|p=769<U+2013>770}}{{Sfn|Johnson|2006|pp=193<U+2013>194}}

In the case of mouse lemurs, the rise in species numbers has been only slightly less sudden and dramatic. Classified as one species by [[Ernst Schwarz]] in 1931 (excluding one, [[Coquerel's giant mouse lemur]], that is no longer classified in ''Microcebus''),{{Sfn|Schwarz|1931|pp=401<U+2013>403}} the genus was revised to contain two species, the [[gray mouse lemur]] (''Microcebus murinus'') and the [[brown mouse lemur]] (''M.&nbsp;rufus''), after an extensive field study in 1972 showed both living in [[sympatry]] in southeastern Madagascar.{{Sfn|Kappeler|Rasoloarison|2003|p=1310}}  At the time, the gray mouse lemur was known in the drier parts of the north, west, and south, while the brown mouse lemur inhabited the humid rainforest regions of the east.  However, we now know the [[species diversity]] and distribution to be significantly more complex.{{Sfn|Garbutt|2007|p=86}}  Revisions throughout the 1990s and 2000s identified numerous new species through genetic testing using [[mitochondrial DNA]], demonstrating that the genus is represented by a multitude of cryptic species.{{Sfn|Mittermeier|Ganzhorn|Konstant|Glander|2008|p=1615}}{{Sfn|Braune|Schmidt|Zimmermann|2008}}{{Sfn|Olivieri|Zimmermann|Randrianambinina|Rasoloharijaona|2007|p=309}}{{Sfn|Louis|Engberg|McGuire|McCormick|2008}}  Many, but not all of these defined species have been supported by [[nuclear DNA]] tests.{{Sfn|Weisrock|Rasoloarison|Fiorentino|Ralison|2010|pp=8<U+2013>9}}

However, there are still concerns that species are being identified prematurely.  [[Ian Tattersall]], an anthropologist who recognized 42 species of lemur in 1982,{{Sfn|Tattersall|1982|pp=40<U+2013>43}} has expressed concern that the geographically organized variety in lemur populations is being recognized with full species status while the number of subspecies in lemur genera has virtually disappeared.  He has argued that taxonomists are confusing differentiation and [[speciation]], two processes that are often unrelated, while denying the role of [[microevolution]] in evolutionary processes.{{Sfn|Tattersall|2007|pp=21<U+2013>22}}  Still other researchers who emphasize the framework of the "general lineage concept of species" contend that lineage divergence or differentiation demarcates the beginning of a new species.{{Sfn|Weisrock|Rasoloarison|Fiorentino|Ralison|2010|p=8}}

New species have been identified due to differences in [[Comparative anatomy|morphology]], karyotypes, cytochrome ''b'' sequences, and other genetic tests, as well as several combinations of these.{{Sfn|Tattersall|2007}}  When nuclear DNA (nDNA) was tested in conjunction with mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) in mouse lemurs, a few species, such as [[Claire's mouse lemur]] (''Microcebus mamiratra'') were demonstrated to be indistinguishable from other closely related species.  In such cases, nDNA did not vary, but the mtDNA that had been used to define it as a species was still distinct.  Differences in results between nDNA, which is inherited from both parents, and mtDNA, which is inherited from the mother, was attributed to female [[philopatry]], where females remain within or close to the [[home range]] into which they were born while males disperse.  Since the isolated population known as Claire's mouse lemur has distinct mtDNA, but not nDNA, it is likely to contain a population descended from a related group of females, but which still disperses and interbreeds with nearby populations.{{Sfn|Weisrock|Rasoloarison|Fiorentino|Ralison|2010|p=11}}

Traditionally, karyology has been considered when determining species status.{{Sfn|Ankel-Simons|2007|pp=544}}  For example, in 2006, three new species of sportive lemur were named based partly on karyotypes.{{Sfn|Andriaholinirina|Fausser|Roos|Zinner|2006}}  From the lemurs studied so far, the diploid number of chromosomes varies between 2n=20 and 2n=66.  In the case of the true lemurs, the diploid number ranges from 2n=44 to 2n=60 while the individual chromosome sizes vary considerably, despite strong similarities in morphology.{{Sfn|Ankel-Simons|2007|pp=541<U+2013>544}}

Sometimes distinctions are made due to very slight differences in [[pelage]] coloration.  For instance, three distinctly colored types of mouse lemur were discovered in a multi-year study in [[Beza Mahafaly Reserve]] in southern Madagascar, but rather than being separate species, DNA tests revealed that they all belonged to a single species, the [[reddish-gray mouse lemur]] (''Microcebus griseorufus'').{{Sfn|Heckman|Rasoazanabary|Machlin|Godfrey|2006|p=1}} For this reason, further research is needed to confirm or deny the recent species splits.  Only through detailed studies of morphology, ecology, behavior, and genetics can the true number of lemur species be determined.{{Sfn|Yoder|2007|p=867}}
