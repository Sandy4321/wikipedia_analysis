The '''Excalibur''' was a closed bolt, dual solenoid controlled [[Electropneumatic paintball gun|electropneumatic]] [[paintball]] [[paintball marker|marker]] designed by Aaron Kendrick Alexander and manufactured by AKALMP, Inc. beginning in/around 2000/2001. The Excalibur has a reputation for being solidly built and gas-efficient, albeit heavy. The standing record for the shot count is approximately 2000 shots on a 68ci/4500psi tank at 280 feet per second. Most guns in that range get around 1200 shots at that velocity.

Due to [[patent]] issues encountered with [[Smart Parts]], AKALMP no longer produces Excaliburs or any other electropneumatic markers as of 2005. They continue to make regulators including the 2liter and sidewinder regulator.
