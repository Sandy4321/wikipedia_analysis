He plays both [[forward (basketball)|forward positions]], and shoots his jump shot left-handed, though he is also [[ambidexterity|ambidextrous]]. Beasley played [[college basketball]] for [[Kansas State Wildcats men's basketball|Kansas State University]] for one year before declaring for the NBA draft on April 14, 2008.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.kstatesports.com/ViewArticle.dbml?SPSID=3084&SPID=213&DB_OEM_ID=400&ATCLID=1439719 |title=Beasley to declare for NBA Draft |date=2008-04-14}}</ref>

==High school==
Beasley was born in [[Frederick, Maryland]]. While growing up in Maryland, Beasley played for one the country's most successful [[Amateur Athletic Union|AAU]] youth teams at the time, the [[PG Jaguars]].  Beasley won multiple national championships with this team alongside future fellow blue-chip recruits [[Kevin Durant]] ([[University of Texas at Austin|Texas]])<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nba.com/bulls/news/beasley_080617.html |title=Michael Beasley: Ready to Rock in the NBA |date=2008-06-14}}</ref> and Chris Braswell ([[University of North Carolina at Charlotte|UNC Charlotte]]).  Beasley later moved on to play AAU ball for DC Assault's 17 & Under team, playing alongside such players as former KSU teammate Ron Anderson, Nolan Smith ([[Duke University|Duke]]), Chris Wright ([[Georgetown University|Georgetown]]), Austin Freeman (Georgetown), and Julian Vaughn (Georgetown).  During this time Beasley also attended a number of high schools including [[Bowie High School (Maryland)|Bowie High School]] ([[Bowie, Maryland]]), National Christian Academy ([[Fort Washington, Maryland]]), The Pendleton School (a section of the [[IMG Academy]] in [[Bradenton, Florida]]), [[Riverdale Baptist School]] ([[Upper Marlboro, Maryland]]), [[Oak Hill Academy (Virginia)|Oak Hill Academy]] ([[Mouth of Wilson, Virginia]]), and [[Notre Dame Preparatory School (Fitchburg, Massachusetts)]]).<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/03/11/AR2007031101466.html |title=For Beasley, It's a Jumping Point |date=2007-03-17 | work=The Washington Post | first=Eli | last=Saslow}}</ref>

He was named as a 2006 USA Men's U18 National Team member on June 26, 2006. Beasley averaged team highs of 13.8 ppg. and 8.3 rpg at the 2006 FIBA Americas U18 Championship for Men in [[San Antonio, Texas]]. He ranked fifth in rebounds per game (8.3 rpg) among all 2006 tournament leaders, and he ranks third all-time in the USA Men's U18 record book.

He was named to the [[McDonald's All-American]] team.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mcdonaldsallamerican.com/stats/2007boys_roster.pdf |title=2007 McDonald's All American High School Basketball Team|publisher= McDonalds All American|accessdate=2007-02-29}}</ref> In the [[2007 McDonald's All-American Boys Game]] he won the MVP with 23 points and 12 rebounds.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.usatoday.com/sports/preps/basketball/2007-03-28-mcdonalds-game_N.htm|title=Beasley wills West to McDonald's all-star win |publisher=USA Today |accessdate=2007-03-29 | first=Christopher | last=Lawlor | date=March 29, 2007}}</ref>

[[Rivals.com]] rated Beasley first in the class of 2007 high school basketball prospects.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://rivalshoops.rivals.com/viewrank.asp?ra_key=1611 |title=Rivals.com Rivals150 2007 |publisher=Rivals.com |accessdate=2008-04-05}}</ref>

==Collegiate career==
Beasley began his freshman year at [[Kansas State Wildcats men's basketball|Kansas State]] in the fall of 2007.  In the 2007<U+2013>2008 regular season, Beasley was one of the most dominant players in the country. His 26.2 points (third-leading) and nation-leading 12.4 rebounds were the most by a [[Big 12 Conference|Big 12]] player in any season. His 866 total points and 408 rebounds ranked third and second among all freshmen in NCAA history. He also led the nation in [[double-double]]s (28), 40-point games (three), 30-point, 10-rebound games (13), and 20-point, 10-rebound games (22).<ref name="drafted2nd" /> His 28 double-doubles broke the freshman double-double record previously held by [[Carmelo Anthony]]<ref name="drafted2nd" /> who had 22 double-doubles in his only season at Syracuse in 2002<U+2013>03. On February 23, 2008, Beasley scored a Big 12 record 44 points in a 86<U+2013>92 loss at [[Baylor Bears|Baylor]].<ref>[http://sports.espn.go.com/ncb/recap?gameId=280540239 Beasley's Big 12 record 44 points not enough to save Kansas State on road]</ref> (This mark has since been matched by Kansas State's Denis Clemente.<ref>[http://espn.go.com/ncb/recap?gameId=290310251 Clemente's 44 tie Big 12 mark as K-State drops No. 12 Texas]</ref>) Beasley became known as an unstoppable force when shooting, finishing the season shooting 53.7 percent from the field (282 of 525). He also finished the season shooting 39.5 percent from 3-point range.

Beasley holds 30 Kansas State career, single-season and freshman records as well as 17 [[Big 12 Conference|Big 12]] single-game and single-season marks. Beasley guided the Wildcats to a 20<U+2013>10 record and a 10<U+2013>6 [[Big 12 Conference]] record.  Some of they key conference victories were a win at [[Oklahoma Sooners|Oklahoma]] and, a home victory against [[Texas A&M Aggies|Texas A&M]], and a victory against then-unbeaten #2 [[2007-08 Kansas Jayhawks men's basketball team|Kansas]], marking the first time in over four years that Kansas State defeated a Top 10 team at home (Kansas State beat #10 [[Texas Longhorns|Texas]], 58<U+2013>48 on March 6, 2004), the first time K-State beat Kansas in Manhattan since 1983 and the first-ever victory against the Jayhawks in Bramlage Coliseum. The win partially backed up a boast he had made before the season about K-State's prospects against the Jayhawks:

{{cquote|We're going to beat Kansas [[Bramlage Coliseum|at home]]. We're going to beat them [[Allen Fieldhouse|in their house]]. We're going to beat them in Africa. Wherever we play, we're going to beat them.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/ncb/preview?gameId=280302306 |title=Kansas-Kansas St. Preview |author=Stats LLC |publisher=''ESPN.com'' |date=2008-01-30 |accessdate=2008-03-01}}</ref>}}

On March 1, 2008, his boast did not come true, as [[2007-08 Kansas Jayhawks men's basketball team|Kansas]] won the return match in [[Lawrence, Kansas|Lawrence]], 88<U+2013>74 despite 39 points and 11 rebounds from Beasley. He matched a Big 12 record by equaling former [[Kansas Jayhawks|Kansas]] player [[Drew Gooden]]'s record for most double-doubles in a season (25).<ref>[http://sports.espn.go.com/ncb/recap?gameId=280612305 Kansas capitalizes on Beasley's early foul trouble to rout Wildcats]</ref> With his 33-point, 14-rebound effort against [[Colorado Buffaloes men's basketball|Colorado]] on March 4, he eclipsed [[Mitch Richmond]]'s 20-year-old school single-season points record (768; 1987<U+2013>88), while he broke the Big 12 record for double-doubles in a season with his 26th for the year.<ref>[http://sports.espn.go.com/ncb/recap?gameId=280642306 Kansas St. 78, Colorado 72 <U+2013> Recap <U+2013> March 4, 2008]</ref> He is just the 27th player in NCAA [[Division I (NCAA)|Division I]] history to post 26 or more double-doubles in a season and the first since [[Utah Utes men's basketball|Utah]]'s [[Andrew Bogut]] (26) did it in 2004<U+2013>05.

===Awards and honors===
Beasley and [[Bob Boozer]] are the only players in Kansas State history to earn first team All-America honors from the [[Associated Press]].  Boozer, the school's only consensus first team All-American, was named to the first team after his outstanding 1959 season.  Overall, Beasley is just the fifth player in school history to earn recognition to any of organization's three All-America teams, joining [[Rolando Blackman]] (third team <U+2013> 1980); Bob Boozer (second team <U+2013> 1958; first team <U+2013> 1959), [[Mike Evans (basketball)|Mike Evans]] (third team <U+2013> 1978) and Dick Knostman (third team <U+2013> 1952; second team <U+2013> 1953).

Beasley was selected to the 10-member 2008 John R. Wooden Award All-America team as well as one of five finalists for the prestigious John R. Wooden Player of the Year Award, which was awarded to [[Tyler Hansbrough]] on April 11 at the Los Angeles Athletic Club.

Beasley became the second consecutive standout freshman (after [[Kevin Durant]] the previous year) to win both [[Big 12]] Player of the Year and Freshman of the Year accolades.

Beasley became the fourth player in school history to be honored as the league's Player of the Year and the first since the inception of the Big 12.  He joined [[Lon Kruger]] (1973 and 1974), [[Mike Evans (basketball)|Mike Evans]] (1977 and 1978) and [[Rolando Blackman]] (1980) as Wildcats to be named to conference Player of the Year.  He was the first player to earn the distinction of league Freshman of the Year and the 12th overall to be selected as either Freshman or Newcomer of the Year since 1970.  Six freshmen (Bob Zender <U+2013> 1970; [[Steve Mitchell]] <U+2013> 1971; Lon Kruger <U+2013> 1972; Mike Evans <U+2013> 1975; Curtis Redding <U+2013> 1977 and [[Ed Nealy]] <U+2013> 1979) in school history have been named Newcomer of the Year.

Beasley earned his second major National Player of the Year honor as he was selected to the honor by Rivals.com.  He was also named the organization's National Freshman of the Year and to its All-America first team.

In addition to earning Player of the Year accolades from both CBS Sports.com and Rivals.com, Beasley was named one of four finalists for the 2008 Naismith Player of the Year Award, which was awarded to Tyler Hansbrough, presented by AT&T and the Atlanta Tipoff Club.

He, along with fellow finalists Memphis' [[Chris Douglas-Roberts]], North Carolina's [[Tyler Hansbrough]] and UCLA's [[Kevin Love]], traveled to the Final Four on April 6, 2008, where the trophy was presented at the National Association of Basketball Coaches (NABC) Guardians of the Game awards program. He also was one of 10 finalists for the Oscar Robertson Player of the Year award and one of 25 for the [[John R. Wooden Award]], which was also claimed by Tyler Hansbrough.

In addition to his National Player of the Year awards, Beasley was named National Freshman of the Year by four organizations, including CBS Sports.com, Rivals.com, [[The Sporting News]] and U.S. Basketball Writers Association (USBWA).  He has also been selected a first team All-American by numerous outlets, including CBS Sports.com, [[Dick Vitale]], ESPN.com, Rivals.com, Sports Illustrated, The Sporting News and U.S. Basketball Writers Association.  In addition, he was chosen as a first team Freshman All-American by CBS Sports.com and Rivals.com, while teammate [[Bill Walker (basketball)|Bill Walker]] was announced to CBS Sports.com's Freshman All-America third team.<ref>[http://www.kstatesports.com/ViewArticle.dbml?DB_OEM_ID=400&ATCLID=1418752 Beasley earns another Player of the Year award <U+2013> Kansas State University Wildcats Official Athletics Site<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>
