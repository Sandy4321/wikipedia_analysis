'''M-554''' was a short unsigned [[Michigan Highway System|state trunkline route]] in the [[U.S. state]] of [[Michigan]] in the city of [[Marquette, Michigan|Marquette]]. This highway was transferrd to the City of Marquette on [[October 10]] [[2005]] in the same "route swap" that extended [[M-553 (Michigan highway)|M-553]] and decommissioned [[U.S. Route 41 Business (Marquette, Michigan)|BUS US 41]]. Since then M-554 is now known as Division Street, and it is maintained by the city of Marquette.

==Route description==
The southern terminus was at the intersection with M-553 and McClellan Ave. The northern terminus was the intersection of Division St. and Pioneer Rd. The entire {{convert|0.852|mi|km|3|adj=on}} length was within the City of Marquette. This section of town is relatively flat with trees. The roadway has a few gentle curves.<ref name="googleM">{{cite map |publisher=Google Maps |title=S McClellan Ave & M-553, Marquette, MI 49855, to County Road 553 & Pioneer Road, Marquette, MI 49855 |url= http://maps.google.com/maps?saddr=S+McClellan+Ave+%26+M-553,+Marquette,+MI+49855&geocode=&dirflg=&daddr=M-553+%26+Pioneer+Rd,+Marquette,+MI&f=d&sll=46.516646,-87.413557&sspn=0.009391,0.014334&ie=UTF8&t=p&z=15 |year=2008 |cartography=NAVTEQ | accessdate=2008-07-31 }}</ref> The only signage present along the route were street signs erected by the City of Marquette.

==History==
M-554 was created when [[Marquette County, Michigan|Marquette County]] Road 553 was turned over to the [[Michigan Department of Transportation]] on [[October 1]], [[1998]]. CR&nbsp;553 became M-553 from its southern terminus at [[M-35 (Michigan highway)|M-35]] near [[Gwinn, Michigan|Gwinn]] to the intersection with McClellan Ave. in the southern part of Marquette. The remainder of CR 553 from McClellan Ave to Division St. was given the M-554 designation.<ref name="mpr"/> On [[October 10]], [[2005]], the City of Marquette and MDOT swapped jurisdiction of three roadways in Marquette. The signage was changed on [[November 9]], [[2005]] reflecting the changeover of M-554 and BUS&nbsp;US&nbsp;41 to the city's control and McClellan Avenue to the state's control. This change ended the existence of M-554.<ref name="jtpr">{{cite press release |title= MDOT and city of Marquette complete jurisdictional transfer |publisher=[[Michigan Department of Transportation]] |date=[[November 9]], [[2005]] |url=http://www.michigan.gov/mdot/0,1607,7-151-9620_11057-129975--,00.html |accessdate=2008-07-31}}</ref>
