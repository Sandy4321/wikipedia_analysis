He was born in [[Talcahuano, Chile|Talcahuano]] on [[1915]], the oldest son of Carlos Prats Risopatr<U+00F3>n and Hilda Gonz<U+00E1>lez Su<U+00E1>rez.  He joined the Army in [[1931]], and graduated top of his class. In 1935 he was commissioned as an artillery officer. Three years later he became a Sub Lieutenant. Soon he returned to the Military Academy, this time as a teacher. He taught there and at the War Academy until 1954. In 1944, he married [[Sofia Cuthbert|Sofia Cuthbert Chiarleoni]], with whom he had 3 daughters.

In 1954, he was promoted to Major, and sent to military mission in the US, as adjunt military attach<U+00E9>, until 1958. That year he was promoted to Lieutenant Colonel, and returned as teacher to the War Academy. In 1961, he became commander of the Artillery Regiment  N<U+00BA>3 <U+201C>Chorrillos<U+201D>, and in 1963, became commander of the Regiment N<U+00BA>1 <U+201C>Tacna<U+201D>.

In 1964 is promoted to Colonel and sent as military attach<U+00E9> to [[Argentina]]. He returned to Chile in 1967 as commander of the III Army Division. In 1968 is promoted to Brigade General and Chief of the General Staff. The following year is promoted to Division General, and after a brilliant career, was named Commander-in-chief on [[October 26]], [[1970]], by President [[Eduardo Frei Montalva]], following the assassination of his predecessor, General [[Ren<U+00E9> Schneider]] a few days earlier, on [[October 22]]. His nomination allayed all fears of a possible military intervention because of the election of [[Salvador Allende]] to the presidency.

== Public role during the Allende years ==
[[image:Prats03.jpg|thumb|300px|lright|President [[Salvador Allende]] and General Prats during a military parade in 1972]]
General Prats became the head of the "constitutionalists", all members of the armed forces who lined themselves behind the [[Schneider Doctrine]]. With time, he became the strongest supporter of President [[Salvador Allende|Allende]], and was a member of his cabinet several times, even becoming his vice-President in [[1972]]. 

===Alejandrina Cox incident===
{{main|Alejandrina Cox incident}}

===Tanquetazo===
{{main|tanquetazo}}
On [[June 29]], [[1973]], he was the key player in putting down a bloody coup attempt known as the ''Tanquetazo'' .

===Resignation===
Following a bizarre scandal caused by a traffic incident, he was finally forced to resign on [[August 22]], [[1973]], embarrassed by the public protest of the wives of his  in front of his home.  Along with him  resigned in a show of support for a constitutional solution to the political crisis of Chile. All the rest were in favor of a military solution.

Shortly after another very public incident occurred. This one involved the wives of his Generals and officers who, on [[August 22]], [[1973]], staged a rally in front of his home and called him a coward for not restoring civil order in Chile. That event made clear to him that his policies had no support among his fellow officers. This time General Prats resigned his position both as Interior minister and as Commander in Chief of the Army the very next day. With only two other generals in favor of a constitutional solution to the political crisis, Generals [[Mario Sepulveda Squella|Mario Sep<U+00FA>lveda Squella]] and [[Guillermo Pickering]] (both in key troop command positions), also presented their resignations in a show of support. His replacement as Commander in Chief of the Army was his second in command and an officer thought to be loyal to Allende, General [[Augusto Pinochet]]. 

He proposed General [[Augusto Pinochet]], his second in command and an officer thought to be loyal to Allende, as his replacement as Army Commander-in-chief. General Pinochet took over the position on [[August 23]], [[1973]]. General Prats' retirement removed the last real obstacle for a military coup, same that took place only three weeks later, on [[September 11]], [[1973]]. Immediately after the coup, on [[September 15]], [[1973]], he exiled himself and his wife to [[Argentina]].

==Assassination ==
On [[September 30]], [[1974]], in [[Buenos Aires]],  he was killed along with his wife Sofia Cuthbert, outside his own apartment, by a radio-controlled [[car bomb]], throwing debris up to the ninth storey balcony of the building across the street. Later, it was found that the assassination was planned by members of the Chilean secret police [[DINA]], led by [[Michael Townley]], who also carried out the [[Orlando Letelier]] assassination.

===Legal aftermath and investigations===
In [[Chile]], the judge investigating this case, [[Alejandro Solis]], definitively relaxed [[Augusto Pinochet|Pinochet]] on this particular case, after the [[Chilean Supreme court]] rejected in [[January 2005]] a demand to lift the ex-dictator's immunity. The direction of DINA, including chief [[Manuel Contreras]], ex-chief of operation and retired general [[Raul Iturriaga Neuman]], his brother [[Roger Iturriaga]], and ex-brigadiers [[Pedro Espinoza Bravo]] and [[Jose Zara]], are accused in Chile of this assassination.

In Argentina, DINA's civil agent [[Enrique Arancibia Clavel]] was sentenced to life imprisonment in General Prat's case. In 2003, federal judge Maria Servini de Cubria asked Chile for the extradition of [[Mariana Callejas]], who was [[Michael Townley]]'s wife, and [[Cristoph Willikie]], a retired colonel from the Chilean army - all three of them are accused of this crime. But Chilean judge Nibaldo Segura from the Appeals court, refused in July 2005, arguing that they had already been prosecuted in Chile<ref>[http://www.jornada.unam.mx/2000/05/22/mun6.html Chilean agent convicted over Prats' killing (in Spanish)]</ref>.

It also has been claimed that Italian terrorist [[Stefano Delle Chiaie]] was involved in the murder of General Carlos Prats. Along with fellow extremist [[Vincenzo Vinciguerra]], Delle Chiaie testified in [[Rome]] in December [[1995]] before judge Maria Servini de Cubria that Enrique Arancibia Clavel (a former Chilean secret police agent prosecuted for [[crimes against humanity]] in [[2004]]<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/3596316.stm Vital rights ruling in Argentina]</ref> and [[Michael Townley]] were directly involved in this assassination<ref>[http://www.cooperativa.cl/p4_noticias/antialone.html?)page=http://www.cooperativa.cl/p4_noticias/site/artic/20050330/pags/20050330114755.html Michael Townley's interrogation (in Spanish)]</ref>.)
