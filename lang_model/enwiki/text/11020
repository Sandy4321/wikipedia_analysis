'''Oil shale''', also known as '''kerogen shale''', is an organic-rich [[fine-grained]] [[sedimentary rock]] containing [[kerogen]] (a solid mixture of [[organic chemical compound]]s) from which liquid [[hydrocarbon]]s called [[shale oil]] (not to be confused with [[tight oil]]<U+2014>[[Petroleum|crude oil]] occurring naturally in shales) can be produced.  Shale oil is a substitute for conventional crude oil; however, extracting shale oil from oil shale is more costly than the production of conventional crude oil both financially and in terms of its [[Environmental impact of the oil shale industry|environmental impact]].<ref name=csm/><ref name=wec>

Heating oil shale to a sufficiently high temperature causes the chemical process of [[pyrolysis]] to [[Yield (chemistry)|yield]] a [[vapor]]. Upon cooling the vapor, the liquid [[shale oil]]<U+2014>an [[unconventional oil]]<U+2014>is separated from [[Combustibility|combustible]] [[Oil shale gas|oil-shale gas]] (the term ''[[shale gas]]'' can also refer to gas occurring naturally in shales).

General composition of oil shales constitutes inorganic matrix, bitumens, and kerogen.  While the bitumen portion of oil shales is soluble in [[carbon disulfide]], kerogen portion is insoluble in carbon disulfide and can contain [[iron]], [[vanadium]], [[nickel]], [[molybdenum]], and [[uranium]].<ref name=yen/>  Oil shale contains a lower percentage of organic matter than coal. In commercial grades of oil shale the ratio of organic matter to mineral matter lies approximately between 0.75:5 and 1.5:5. At the same time, the organic matter in oil shale has an atomic ratio of hydrogen to carbon (H/C) approximately 1.2 to 1.8&nbsp;times lower than for crude oil and about 1.5 to 3&nbsp;times higher than for coals.<ref name=wec/><ref name=arvoots/><ref name=vankrevelen>

As source rocks for most conventional [[oil reservoir]]s, oil shale deposits are found in all world oil provinces, although most of them are too deep to be exploited economically.<ref name=weo2010/>  As with all oil and gas resources, analysts distinguish between oil shale resources and oil shale reserves. "Resources" refers to all oil shale deposits, while "reserves", represents those deposits from which producers can extract oil shale economically using existing technology.

== Extraction and processing ==
{{Main|Shale oil extraction}}
[[File:Oil shale extraction overview.png|thumb|right|Overview of shale oil extraction process|alt=A vertical [[flowchart]] begins with an oil shale deposit and follows two major branches. Conventional ''ex situ'' processes, shown on the right, proceed through mining, crushing, and retorting. Spent shale output is noted. ''In situ'' process flows are shown in the left branch of the flowchart. The deposit may or may not be fractured; in either case, the deposit is retorted and the oil is recovered. The two major branches converge at the bottom of the chart, indicating that extraction is followed by [[refining]], which involves thermal and chemical treatment and [[hydrogenation]], yielding liquid fuels and useful byproducts.|Overview of shale oil extraction.]]

Most exploitation of oil shale involves mining followed by shipping elsewhere, after which one can burn the shale directly to generate electricity, or undertake further processing. The most common methods of [[surface mining]] involve [[open pit mining]] and [[strip mining]]. These procedures remove most of the overlying material to expose the deposits of oil shale, and become practical when the deposits occur near the surface. [[Underground mining (soft rock)|Underground mining of oil shale]], which removes less of the overlying material, employs the [[Room and pillar|room-and-pillar method]].<ref name=rand>

In either case, the chemical process of [[pyrolysis]] converts the kerogen in the oil shale to shale oil ([[synthetic crude]] oil) and oil shale gas. Most conversion technologies involve heating shale in the absence of [[oxygen]] to a temperature at which kerogen decomposes (pyrolyses) into gas, condensable oil, and a solid residue. This usually takes place between {{convert|450|<U+00B0>C|<U+00B0>F|0|lk=on}} and {{convert|500|<U+00B0>C|<U+00B0>F|0|lk=on}}.<ref name=csm/> The process of decomposition begins at relatively low temperatures ({{convert|300|<U+00B0>C|<U+00B0>F|0|disp=or}}), but proceeds more rapidly and more completely at higher temperatures.<ref name=koel>

''In-situ'' processing involves heating the oil shale underground. Such technologies can potentially extract more oil from a given area of land than ''ex-situ'' processes, since they can access the material at greater depths than surface mines can.  Several [[company|companies]] have patented methods for ''in-situ'' retorting. However, most of these methods remain in the experimental phase. One can distinguish ''true in-situ'' processes (TIS) and ''modified in-situ'' processes (MIS). ''True in-situ'' processes do not involve mining the oil shale. ''Modified in-situ'' processes involve removing part of the oil shale and bringing it to the surface for modified ''in-situ'' retorting in order to create permeability for gas flow in a rubble chimney. Explosives rubblize the oil-shale deposit.<ref name=fossilenergy>

Industry can use oil shale as a fuel for thermal power-plants, burning it (like coal) to drive [[steam turbine]]s; some of these plants [[cogeneration|employ the resulting heat]] for [[district heating]] of homes and businesses. In addition to its use as a fuel, oil shale may also serve in the production of specialty [[carbon fiber]]s, [[Adsorption|adsorbent carbons]], [[carbon black]], [[phenols]], [[resin]]s, [[glue]]s, [[tanning]] agents, mastic, road bitumen, [[cement]], bricks, construction and decorative blocks, soil-additives, [[fertilizer]]s, [[rock wool|rock-wool]] insulation, glass, and pharmaceutical products.<ref name=eu/>  However, oil shale use for production of these items remains small or only in its experimental stages.<ref name=wec/><ref name=dyni/> Some oil shales yield [[sulfur]], [[ammonia]], [[alumina]], [[soda ash]], uranium, and [[nahcolite]] as shale-oil extraction byproducts. Between 1946 and 1952, a marine type of ''[[Basidiolichen|Dictyonema]]'' shale served for uranium production in [[Sillam<U+00E4>e]], Estonia, and between 1950 and 1989 Sweden used [[alum]] shale for the same purposes.<ref name=dyni/>  Oil shale gas has served as a substitute for [[natural gas]], but {{as of | 2009 | alt = as of 2009}}, producing oil shale gas as a natural-gas substitute remained economically infeasible.<ref name=proceedings>

The amount of economically recoverable oil shale is unknown.<ref name=weo2010/>  The various attempts to develop oil shale deposits have succeeded only when the cost of shale-oil production in a given region comes in below the price of crude oil or its other substitutes. According to a survey conducted by the [[RAND Corporation]], the cost of producing a barrel of oil at a surface retorting complex in the United States (comprising a mine, [[retort|retorting plant]], [[upgrader|upgrading plant]], supporting utilities, and spent shale reclamation), would range between [[US dollars|US$]]70<U+2013>95 ($440<U+2013>600/m<sup>3</sup>, adjusted to 2005 values). This estimate considers varying levels of kerogen quality and extraction efficiency. In order to run a profitable operation, the price of crude oil would need to remain above these levels. The analysis also discusses the expectation that processing costs would drop after the establishment of the complex. The hypothetical unit would see a cost reduction of 35<U+2013>70% after producing its first {{convert|500|Moilbbl}}. Assuming an increase in output of {{convert|25|koilbbl/d}} during each year after the start of commercial production, RAND predicts the costs would decline to $35<U+2013>48 per barrel ($220<U+2013>300/m<sup>3</sup>) within 12 years. After achieving the milestone of {{convert|1|Goilbbl}}, its costs would decline further to $30<U+2013>40 per barrel ($190<U+2013>250/m<sup>3</sup>).<ref name=eu>

A 1972 publication in the journal ''P<U+00E9>trole Informations'' ({{ISSN|0755-561X}}) compared shale-based oil production unfavorably with [[coal liquefaction]]. The article portrayed coal liquefaction as less expensive, generating more oil, and creating fewer environmental impacts than extraction from oil shale. It cited a conversion ration of {{convert|650|L|U.S.gal impgal}} of oil per one [[ton]] of coal, as against {{convert|150|L|U.S.gal impgal}} of shale oil per one ton of oil shale.<ref name=laherrere/>

A critical measure of the viability of oil shale as an energy source lies in the ratio of the energy produced by the shale to the energy used in its mining and processing, a ratio known as "Energy Returned on Energy Invested" ([[EROEI]]). A 1984 study estimated the EROEI of the various known oil-shale deposits as varying between 0.7<U+2013>13.3<ref name=science2>

although known oil-shale extraction development projects assert an EROEI between 3 to 10.  According to the World Energy Outlook 2010, the EROEI of ''ex-situ'' processing is typically 4 to 5 while of ''in-situ'' processing it may be even as low as 2. However, according to the IEA most of used energy can be provided by burning the spent shale or oil-shale gas.<ref name=weo2010/>

The water needed in the oil shale retorting process offers an additional economic consideration: this may pose a problem in areas with water scarcity.

Oil-shale extraction can damage the biological and recreational value of land and the ecosystem in the mining area. Combustion and thermal processing generate waste material. In addition, the atmospheric emissions from oil shale processing and combustion include [[carbon dioxide]], a [[greenhouse gas]]. Environmentalists oppose production and usage of oil shale, as it creates even more greenhouse gases than conventional fossil fuels.<ref name="nrdc">
