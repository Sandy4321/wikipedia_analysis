| colspan=3 align=left | The Vienna Philharmonic coin is struck in pure gold, 999.9 fine (24 carats). It is issued every year, in four different face values, sizes and weights. It is used as an investment product (bullion coin), although it finishes almost always in hands of collectors. According to the World Gold Council, was the best selling gold coin in 1992, 1995 and 1996 world wide.
 
A beautiful design of musical instruments representing the world famous [[Vienna Philharmonic Orchestra]] can be seen on the reverse side of the coin.

The great organ in the Golden Hall in Vienna's concert hall ([[Musikverein]]) is the topic for the obverse side of the coin. This is the hall of the Vienna Philharmonic Orchestra. Also on this side is represented the face value in euros, the weight, fineness and year of issue.

Since [[February 1]], [[2008]], this coin is being also minted in Silver. Both sides of the coin feature as on the Vienna Philharmonic pure gold coin. Its face value of <U+201E>1,50 Euro<U+201C> gives the silver piece a different nature, different from the Gold representations of the coin.

The coin shows a dual representation of [[St. Benedict]] and his sister, [[St. Scholastica]]. By many, St. Benedict is the patron saint of [[Western Europe]] and the father of [[western monasticism]]. The rule of monks made by St. Benedict became the foundation for monastic life from the sixth century, still valid today. Together with his sister, he founded also an order of nuns following the same rule. The coin shows him holding the Holy Rule while St. Scholastica holds a dove.

The reverse of the coin shows a monk sitting at a writing desk working on a manuscript. It represents the work of the monks in the middle ages copying books by hand, preserving great areas of knowledge.

The obverse of the coin shows a frontal view of the castle.  Built by [[Hans Ulrich von Eggenberg]], this castle reflects the attraction for astronomy. The four gigantic towers represent the four elements, the 365 windows are for the days of the year, the 24 reception rooms for the hours of a day, etc<U+2026> The construction started in 1625 and was finished in 1642, only after Hans Ulrich<U+2019>s death. 

The reverse side of the coin has a portrait of the contemporary scholar and astronomer, [[Johannes Kepler]].  Kepler was acquainted with Hans Ulrich von Eggenberg personally, and most probably he knew and influenced the creation of the castle. In front of him on the coin is his master piece, the model <U+201C>[[Mysterium Cosmographicum]]<U+201D>.

| colspan="5" align=left |The [[Austrian Federal Government]] decided to commemorate the city charter, which was granted to the town of Hall in Tyrol 700 years ago, with this coin. The city of Hall housed an important mint until 1809, when it was closed. It was at Hall in 1486 that the first large silver coin was struck, the <U+201C>[[Guldengroschen|Guldiner]]<U+201D>. 

The obverse side of the coin shows a satellite mapping the town of Hall from the space.

The reverse side of the coin shows the Guldiner silver coin. However, the design is negative, representing a [[coin die]], as a reference to Hall<U+2019>s history as a significant centre for minting coins. This is the first time a coin die has been reproduced on an Austrian coin, giving a distinctive character of this extraordinary issue.

| colspan="5" align=left | Towards the end of the 19<sup>th</sup> century, the Austrian half of the dual monarchy began to move towards [[constitutionalism]]. A constitutional system with a parliament, the [[Reichsrat (Austria)|Reichsrat]] was created, and a bill of rights was enacted also in 1867. [[Suffrage]] to the Reichstag's lower house was gradually expanded until [[1907]], when equal suffrage for all male citizens was introduced. 

This coin design is based on an historic photo of the opening session of Parliament in 1907, after the elections. 

The two oval portraits in the foreground are of the [[Franz Joseph I of Austria|Emperor Franz Joseph]] and [[Baron Max Wladimir von Beck|Max Wladimir von Beck]], who were responsible for putting the reform through.

| colspan="5" align=left | These two coins were minted celebrating the bi-national hosting of the European championship.  For the first time two coins are minted, one complementing each other (in this particular case the view into the stadium). Both coins express the emotional side of the sport. One coin shows players dribbling, while the other coin shows a striker trying to reach the ball. In the background, fans waving a banner can be observed. In the pieces, all eight venues of the 2008 finals, are depicted.

| colspan="5" align=left | The launch of the largest silver coin in the world has been made by [[Hall in Tirol]]. It has been revealed on the occasion of the [[UEFA Euro 2008|2008 European Championship of Football]] in [[Austria]] and [[Switzerland]]. 

The front side design of the coin is as old as five centuries. 500 years ago in [[Trento|Trient]], [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor|Kaiser Maximilian I]] crowned himself [[Emperor]] and a propaganda coin was issued by the Mint in Hall. In the coin was written: "King of all the lands in Europe<U+201D>. This inscription included the word <U+201C>Europe<U+201D> for the first time. The obverse corresponds to that from the time of Maximilian in [[1508]]. It shows the emperor mounted in armour on a horse; in his hand he holds a banner with the imperial symbol, the double eagle. <ref name=ET_HTC/>

The obverse shows important people in the history of [[Europe]]. You can easily see [[Martin Luther]] (who symbolised the transition from the middle ages to the modern period, his reformation has affected the religious and spiritual landscape of Europe), [[Antonio Vivaldi]] (as an example of the importance of European cultural life), [[James Watt]] (who invented the first [[steam engine]] in the 18th century, representing the industrialization of Europe, which took place in the age of technical innovations) and  [[Bertha von Suttner]] (the Nobel Peace Prize winner). 

The scenes are connected by the mint tower, the symbol of the Hall Mint.  Stars, a symbol of [[European Union|European unity]], surround the tower and symbolize the transition into the European future of the 21st century. <ref>{{cite web | url=http://europataler.at/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=5&Itemid=10&lang=en | title=The Europe Taler web site.}}</ref>
