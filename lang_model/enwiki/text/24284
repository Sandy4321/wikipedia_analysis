The '''Johnny Henderson Grand Annual Chase''' is a Grade 3 [[National Hunt racing|National Hunt]] [[Chase (racing)|chase]] in [[Great Britain]] which is open to [[Horse racing|horses]] aged five years or older. It is run on the New Course at [[Cheltenham Racecourse|Cheltenham]] over a distance of about 2 miles and 110 yards (3,319 metres), and during its running there are fourteen fences to be jumped. It is a [[handicap race]], and it is scheduled to take place each year during the [[Cheltenham Festival]] in March.

==History==
The Grand Annual is the oldest race at the Festival, and it is also the oldest chase in the present National Hunt calendar. It was first run in April 1834, and it was initially contested over three miles of open country at [[Andoversford]], near Cheltenham. The race was discontinued in the 1860s, but it was revived at the turn of the century. During the early 1900s it took place at several different venues, including [[Melton Mowbray]], [[Leicester Racecourse|Leicester]] and [[Warwick Racecourse|Warwick]]. It returned to Cheltenham in 1913.

The name of Johnny Henderson (1920<U+2013>2003), a banker and racehorse owner, was added to the race's title in 2005. Henderson, the father of trainer [[Nicky Henderson|Nicky]], realised in the early 1960s that the racecourse at Cheltenham was attracting the interest of property developers. To safeguard its future, and that of the Festival, Henderson and other [[Jockey Club]] members formed the Racecourse Holdings Trust, and raised <U+00A3>240,000 to purchase the venue.<ref>{{cite news | title = Johnny Henderson obituary | publisher = independent.co.uk | url = http://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/johnny-henderson-549140.html | date = December 24, 2003 | accessdate = 2010-02-12}}</ref>

The running order of the races at the Cheltenham Festival was altered slightly in 2009, and the Johnny Henderson Grand Annual Chase is now the last event on the final day.
