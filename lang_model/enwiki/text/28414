'''U.S. Route 2''' is an east-west [[U.S. Route]] spanning 2,579 miles across the northern continental [[United States]]. US 2 is split into two segments connected by way of roadways in southern [[Canada]]. The two portions of US 2 were not designed to be directly connected, as unlike some routes that have been truncated because of encroaching [[Interstate highway]]s, US 2 has been split since it was commissioned in the original [[1926]] highway plan.

The westernmost terminus of the route is at [[Washington State Route 529|State Route 529]] (Maple Street) in [[Everett, Washington|Everett]], [[Washington]]. The easternmost terminus is at [[Interstate 95 in Maine|Interstate 95]] in [[Houlton, Maine|Houlton]], [[Maine]]. The eastern terminus of the western segment is at [[Interstate 75]] in [[St. Ignace, Michigan]]. The western terminus of the eastern segment is at [[U.S. Route 11]] in [[Rouses Point, New York|Rouses Point]], [[New York]].

As its number indicates, it is the northernmost east-west U.S. Route in the country.

The western segment of US 2 extends from the [[Upper Peninsula of Michigan]] across the northern tier of the lower 48 states. Most of the western route was built roughly paralleling the Great Northern Railway. US2 adopted the railway's route nickname "The Highline" as the most northern crossing in the US.

The [[Adventure Cycling Association]]'s [[Northern Tier]] bicycle touring route follows or parallels US 2 for over 600&nbsp;miles (965&nbsp;km), most notably a 550&nbsp;mile (885&nbsp;km) stretch between [[Columbia Falls, Montana]] and [[Williston, North Dakota]].

====Washington====
{{main|U.S. Route 2 in Washington}}
Within [[Washington]] state, US 2 is the northernmost all-season highway through the [[Cascade range|Cascade Mountains]]. It begins at [[Interstate 5 (Washington)|Interstate 5]] and [[State Route 529 (Washington)|State Route 529]] in [[Everett, Washington|Everett]], and travels east via [[Stevens Pass]], [[Wenatchee, Washington|Wenatchee]], and [[Spokane, Washington|Spokane]] to the border in [[Newport, Washington|Newport]].

====Idaho====
<!-- {{main|U.S. Route 2 in Idaho}} -->
Shortly after entering [[Idaho]] from the east, U.S. 2 Crosses Priest River.  U.S. 2 follows [[Pend Oreille River]] until it empties into [[Lake Pend Oreille]].  U.S. 2 intersects Idaho Route 57 in the town of [[Priest River,Idaho|Priest River]] at mile 5.8.  U.S. 2 intersects U.S. 57 at mile 28.4 in the town of [[Sandpoint, Idaho|Sandpoint]].  The two routes are duplexed for 36.2 miles.  At Three Mile Corner U.S. route 2 continues southeast for 15.8 miles where it crosses into [[Montana]].
{{sectstub}}

====Montana====
<!-- {{main|U.S. Route 2 in Montana}} -->
As US Highway 2 travels through Montana, it creates a vital northern corridor for the state.  The road travels through some of the most beautiful land in the state, especially in its western half, and has more of its mileage within Montana than in any other state.  The road is currently being considered for expansion in the eastern part of the state to create better transportation routes, safety, and possibly bolster the economy of many of the small towns along its trail.{{Fact|date=December 2007}}  It passes through three [[Indian reservation]]s, comes very close to two others, and skirts the southern border of[[Glacier National Park (U.S.)|Glacier National Park]].  

'''The Mountains'''

US 2 passes into Montana 10 miles from [[Troy, Montana|Troy]], a small town.  It also happens to be near the lowest point in Montana, where the [[Kootenai River]] drains out of the state.  The first large town the highway comes to is [[Libby, Montana|Libby]].  After this it meanders south and east towards [[Kalispell]], a city of about 20,000 residents north of [[Flathead Lake]].  The lake is the largest freshwater lake west of the [[Mississippi River]].  From there the highway passes through the southern end of Glacier National Park and follows the Middle Fork of the [[Flathead River]].  After crossing the [[continental divide]] at [[Marias Pass]] east of [[East Glacier, Montana|East Glacier]], the road exits the Rocky Mountains and begins its trek through the northern plains.  Just before coming into East Glacier, it crosses the boundary of the [[Blackfeet Indian Reservation]] of northern Montana.

'''The Plains'''

As the road enters the [[Great Plains]], the first town it encounters is [[Browning, Montana|Browning]], the largest town on the Blackfeet Reservation.  From here to the North Dakota border, the surronding area is also known as "The Highline" to Montanans from the early GN railway route.  It next travels through [[Cut Bank, Montana|Cut Bank]] to [[Shelby, Montana|Shelby]], where it becomes the northern border of the area known as the "Golden Triangle" in Montana.  This area is one of the most productive farming regions in the country.  From Shelby it hits a string of small towns before it goes on to [[Havre, Montana|Havre]], near the geographical center of the road in the state.  Just south of Havre and off the road about fifteen miles is the [[Rocky Boy Indian Reservation]].  The road continues east to [[Malta, Montana|Malta]], before which it travels through the [[Fort Belknap Indian Reservation]].  From Malta, the road continues on to [[Glasgow, Montana|Glasgow]], just north of [[Fort Peck Dam]], and then into the [[Fort Peck Indian Reservation]].  The road stays within the reservation for much of its remaining trip through Montana.  On the reservation it goes through [[Wolf Point, Montana|Wolf Point]] and [[Poplar, Montana|Poplar]], and then exits the reservation a short distance before leaving the state.  The final village of [[Bainville, Montana|Bainville]] says goodbye to the road as it leaves the state, near the [[confluence]] of the [[Missouri River|Missouri]] and [[Yellowstone River]]s.

====North Dakota====
<!-- {{main|U.S. Route 2 in North Dakota}} -->
US 2 is an east-west highway that runs through [[North Dakota]]<U+2019>s northern tier of larger cities:  [[Williston, ND|Williston]], [[Minot, North Dakota|Minot]], [[Devils Lake, North Dakota|Devils Lake]], and [[Grand Forks, ND|Grand Forks]].  These cities are about 75 to 100 miles north of  North Dakota<U+2019>s southern tier of larger cities located on [[I-94|Interstate 94]]:  [[Dickinson, North Dakota|Dickinson]], [[Bismarck, North Dakota|Bismarck]]/[[Mandan, North Dakota|Mandan]], [[Jamestown, North Dakota|Jamestown]], and [[Fargo, North Dakota|Fargo]]/[[West Fargo, North Dakota|West Fargo]].  Each city (or pair) in each tier is separated by about 75 to 125 miles.  This alignment is probably the reason that two major east-west four-lane highways have developed in North Dakota.  

US 2 junctions with two north-south four-lane highways in North Dakota:  [[U.S. Route 83|US 83]] at Minot and [[Interstate 29]] at Grand Forks.  In addition, it junctions with two other US Highways that, except for shorter stretches that are four-laned, are mostly two-lane highways in North Dakota:  [[U.S. Route 85|US 85]] at Williston and [[U.S. Route 52|US 52]] at Minot.  All four of these highways provide routes either to the border at Mexico or deep into southern USA.

North Dakota has been converting sections of US 2 from two lanes to four lanes for many years.  The section from Grand Forks to Minot was completed several years ago.  The section from Minot to Williston will be completed in the summer of 2008 in a campaign that began a few years ago and was labeled <U+201C>Across the State in Two Thousand Eight<U+201D>.  The slogan is a slight exaggeration.  By the end of summer in 2008, US 2 will be four-laned from North Dakota<U+2019>s eastern edge to just past Williston, a stretch of about 343 miles, leaving the remaining 11 miles to the Montana border as two-lane.  North Dakota<U+2019>s governor has said that North Dakota will four-lane the remaining stretch if Montana is willing to continue the four-laning project from the border into their state.

In [[Rugby, North Dakota]], the highway passes the location designated in 1931 as the geographical center of [[North America]]. The monument marking the geographic center had to be relocated in 1971 when US 2 was converted from 2 lanes to 4 lanes.<ref>Rugby Area Chamber of Commerce, [http://www.rugbynorthdakota.com/tourism/GCenter.aspx Geographical Center of North America]</ref>

====Minnesota====
<!-- {{main|U.S. Route 2 in Minnesota}} -->
The portion of US 2 from [[Cass Lake, Minnesota|Cass Lake]] to [[Bemidji, Minnesota|Bemidji]] is officially designated the '''[[Paul Bunyan]] Expressway'''.  
At the crossing between [[Duluth, Minnesota|Duluth, Minn.]] and [[Superior, Wisconsin|Superior, Wisc.]], the highway crosses the [[Richard I. Bong Memorial Bridge]], about 8,300 feet (2,500 m) in length&mdash;roughly 11,800 feet (3,600 m) in length when the above land approaches are included.

Legally, the Minnesota section of U.S. 2 is defined as Routes 8 and 203 in Minnesota Statutes <U+00A7><U+00A7> 161.114(2) and 
161.115(134).<ref>[http://ros.leg.mn/bin/getpub.php?pubtype=STAT_CHAP_SEC&year=2006&section=161.114 Minnesota Statute <U+00A7> 161.114]</ref><ref>[http://ros.leg.mn/bin/getpub.php?pubtype=STAT_CHAP_SEC&year=2006&section=161.115 Minnesota Statute <U+00A7> 161.115]</ref>

Of the 266 miles of US 2 in Minnesota, 146 miles have four lanes, mostly located in the western part of the state.

====Wisconsin====
{{main|U.S. Route 2 in Wisconsin}}
After crossing the Bong Bridge and entering into the city of [[Superior, Wisconsin|Superior]], 
the highway joins Belknap Street. After crossing the midsection of Superior, US 2 merges with US 53 for a few miles following East 2nd Street out of the city.
Ten miles outside of Superior, US 53 & US 2 part ways. US 53 veers south toward [[Eau Claire, Wisconsin|Eau Claire]], while US 2 continues to the city of [[Ashland, Wisconsin|Ashland]] and ultimately to the Wisconsin - Michigan state line at the city of [[Ironwood, Michigan|Ironwood]].

====Michigan====
<!-- {{main|U.S. Route 2 in Michigan}} -->
US 2 enters Michigan at the city of [[Ironwood, Michigan|Ironwood]] and runs east to the town of [[Crystal Falls, Michigan|Crystal Falls]], where it turns south and re-enters Wisconsin northwest of [[Florence, Wisconsin|Florence]]. It re-enters Michigan north of [[Iron Mountain, Michigan|Iron Mountain]] and continues through the [[Upper Peninsula of Michigan]] to the cities of [[Escanaba, Michigan|Escanaba]], [[Manistique, Michigan|Manistique]], and [[St. Ignace, Michigan|St. Ignace]].  Along the way, it cuts through the [[Ottawa National Forest|Ottawa]] and [[Hiawatha National Forest]]s.  Its eastern terminus lies at exit 344 of [[Interstate 75 (Michigan)|I-75]], just north of the [[Mackinac Bridge]].

====Into Vermont====
The road starts up at [[U.S. Route 11]], just one mile south of the Canadian border near Champlain, New York.  From there it crosses [[Lake Champlain]] into [[Grand Isle County, Vermont]], traversing the length of the county and crossing the lake over several bridges until it reaches the mainland in [[Milton, Vermont|Milton]] and [[Chittenden County, Vermont|Chittenden County]].  From there it travels south to [[Burlington, Vermont|Burlington]], where it begins to closely parallel [[Interstate 89]] all the way to [[Montpelier, Vermont|Montpelier]] and [[Washington County, Vermont|Washington County]].  At Montpelier, the road turns north-eastward, crossing into  [[Caledonia County, Vermont|Caledonia County]] and passing through [[Saint Johnsbury, Vermont|Saint Johnsbury]].  It then passes into [[Essex County, Vermont|Essex County]], and eventually crosses the [[Connecticut River]] from [[Guildhall, Vermont]] into  [[Lancaster, New Hampshire]].

====New Hampshire====
Once into New Hampshire, the road continues southeastward, passing through [[Jefferson, New Hampshire|Jefferson]] (home to several small amusement parks and roadside attractions, such as Santa's Village and Six Gun City) before heading more easterly, skirting the northern edge of the [[White Mountain National Forest]] into [[Gorham, New Hampshire|Gorham]], where it meets [[New Hampshire Route 16|Route 16]], the major north-south roadway through the eastern half of the forest and past [[Mount Washington (New Hampshire)|Mount Washington]].  From Gorham, the road travels east along the southern banks of the [[Androscoggin River]] to [[Shelburne, New Hampshire|Shelburne]] and eventually crossing into [[Gilead, Maine]].  Throughout its entire 35-mile stretch, the New Hampshire portion of Route 2 is exclusively in [[Coos County, New Hampshire|Coos County]].

====Maine====
From Gilead, Route 2 continues to follow the Androscoggin River, turning north in [[Bethel, Maine|Bethel]] ([[New England Interstate Route 26|Route 26]] continues eastward from this turn).  From there, the road crosses the river and turns north for a short while before turning eastward again, following the curving path of the river on the opposite bank until [[Dixfield, Maine|Dixfield]], where it turns northeast, crossing from [[Oxford County, Maine|Oxford County]], through southeastern [[Franklin County, Maine|Franklin County]] and into [[Somerset County, Maine|Somerset County]].  The road has a major junction with [[U.S. Route 201]] in [[Skowhegan, Maine|Skowhegan]], continuing to [[Penobscot County, Maine|Penobscot County]] and the town of [[Newport, Maine|Newport]], where the road begins a loosely parallel path with [[Interstate 95 in Maine|Interstate 95]], junctioning with the interstate just south-east of the [[Bangor International Airport]] in [[Bangor, Maine|Bangor]].  From there, the road begins following the [[Penobscot River]] northward, passing through [[Orono, Maine|Orono]], crossing the river just south of the main campus of the [[University of Maine]].  In [[Old Town, Maine|Old Town]], the road crosses the river again, staying to the east bank of the river through [[Mattawamkeag, Maine|Mattawamkeag]], crossing the Mattawamkeag River, then heading northward through the rest of the county and into [[Aroostook County, Maine|Aroostook County]], heading due north from [[Macwahoc Plantation, Maine|Macwahoc]], eventually meeting up again with I-95 near Exit 286 in [[Oakfield, Maine|Oakfield]], before crossing back at Exit 291 in Ludlow.  From Ludlow, the road travels due east into [[Houlton, Maine|Houlton]], sharing a concurrency with [[U.S. Route 1]] for just under half a mile, before heading east and terminating just north of [[Houlton International Airport]], near I-95 Exit 305, the last exit in the United States.  However, the original path of the road did not turn around what is now the north-south runway, instead going straight on what is now Old Woodstock Road, over the eventual path of the runway, and crossing Airport Road just south of the exit, meeting at the old U.S. Customs station, two hundred yards due south of the current one.  The corresponding Canadian road also has closed, ending 0.4 miles further from the border than it once did.  The roadway paths are still visible on satellite imagery.

<!--{{dablink|For more details, see the state-specific articles linked in the route description above.}} uncomment once some are written-->
A large portion of the western segment of US 2, and a shorter piece of the eastern segment, follows the old [[Theodore Roosevelt International Highway]]. This [[auto trail]], named in honor of recently-deceased ex-[[POTUS|president]] and [[naturalist]] [[Theodore Roosevelt]], was organized in February 1919 to connect [[Portland, Maine]] with [[Portland, Oregon]].<ref>Max J. Skidmore, Moose Crossing: Portland to Portland on the Theodore Roosevelt International Highway, [[Hamilton Books]], 2006, ISBN 0761835105<!--I actually used the summary on http://www.bestprices.com/cgi-bin/vlink/0761835105.html--></ref> The route taken by this highway left Portland, Maine to the northwest, crossing [[New England]] via [[Littleton, NH|Littleton]] and [[Montpelier, VT|Montpelier]] to [[Burlington, VT|Burlington]]. It crossed [[Lake Champlain]] on the [[Burlington-Port Kent Ferry]] and headed west across [[upstate New York]], through [[Watertown, NY|Watertown]] and [[Rochester, NY|Rochester]] to [[Buffalo, NY|Buffalo]]. After crossing [[southern Ontario]], the highway re-entered the U.S. in [[Detroit, MI|Detroit]], running northwest and north via [[Saginaw, MI|Saginaw]] and [[Alpena, MI|Alpena]] to the [[Upper Peninsula]], where it turned west along the northern tier of the country. This portion took the route past [[Duluth, MN|Duluth]], [[Minot, ND|Minot]], [[Havre, MT|Havre]], and [[Glacier National Park]] to [[Spokane, WA|Spokane]]. In order to reach Portland, Oregon, the highway turned south in [[Washington]] via [[Walla Walla, WA|Walla Walla]] to [[Pendleton, Oregon|Pendleton]], where it headed west again via the [[Columbia River Highway]] to Portland. The last piece of the highway to be completed was over [[Marias Pass]] through Glacier National Park; cars were carried through the park on the [[Great Northern Railway (U.S.)|Great Northern Railway]] until 1930.<ref>[[Clason Map Company]], [http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/infrastructure/midgetmap.htm Midget Map of the Transcontinental Trails of the United States], 1923</ref><ref name="1926 Rand McNally">[[Rand McNally]] Auto Road Atlas, 1926, accessed via the [http://www.broermapsonline.org/members/ Broer Map Library]</ref><ref>Historical marker on US 2 at Marias Pass: "A 56-mile section of highway over Marias Pass was the last section of the Theodore Roosevelt International Highway to be completed. Prior to the completion of this section in 1930, automobiles were loaded onto railcars and transported from one side of the pass to the other. The Theodore Roosevelt International Highway extends 4,060 miles from Portland, Maine, to Portland, Oregon, by way of Ontario, Canada."</ref>

The first inter-state numbering for the Roosevelt Highway was in [[New England]], where the [[New England road marking system]] was established in 1922. [[Route 18 (New England)|Route 18]] followed the auto trail from Portland northwest to [[Montpelier, VT|Montpelier]], where it continued to Burlington via [[Route 14 (New England)|Route 14]]. Many of the states along the route also assigned numbers to the highway; for instance, New York labeled their portion [[Route 3 (New York)|Route 3]] in 1924.<ref>[[New York Times]], New York's Main Highways Designated by Numbers, [[December 21]], [[1924]], p. XX9</ref><ref name="1926 Rand McNally"/> The [[Joint Board on Interstate Highways]] distributed its preliminary plan in 1925, in which a long section of the highway was labeled US 2, from [[St. Ignace, Michigan]] west to [[Bonners Ferry, Idaho]]. East of St. Ignace, instead of crossing to the [[Lower Peninsula]] like the Roosevelt Highway, the proposed Route 2 traveled north to the international border at [[Sault Ste. Marie, MI|Sault Ste. Marie]]. It reappeared at [[Rouses Point, New York]], following [[Route 30 (New England)|Route 30]] and then rejoining the auto trail between Burlington and Montpelier. US 2 and the Roosevelt Highway both connected Montpelier to [[St. Johnsbury, VT|St. Johnsbury]], but the latter took a direct path along Route 18, while the former was assigned to [[Route 25 (New England)|Route 25]] to [[Wells River, VT|Wells River]], where it [[overlap (road)|overlap]]ped proposed [[U.S. Route 5|US 5]] north to St. Johnsbury. There, where the Roosevelt Highway turned southeast to Portland, Route 2 continued east along [[Route 15 (New England)|Route 15]] to [[Bangor, ME|Bangor]] and [[Route 1 (New England)|Route 1]] to [[Calais, ME|Calais]], then heading north on [[Route 24 (New England)|Route 24]] to end in [[Houlton, ME|Houlton]].<ref name="1925 list">Report of Joint Board on Interstate Highways, [[October 30]], [[1925]], Approved by the Secretary of Agriculture, [[November 18]], [[1925]]</ref>

By the time the U.S. Highway system was finalized in late 1926, one relatively minor change had been made to US 2; it was swapped with [[US 1]] between Bangor and Houlton, Maine, placing US 2 along the entire portion of Route 15 east of St. Johnsbury. Several other major parts of the auto trail received numbers, most notably [[US 30]] from Portland, Oregon east to [[Pendleton, OR|Pendleton]], [[US 195]] in eastern Washington, and [[US 23]] in Michigan's Lower Peninsula.<ref name="1926 map">, [[November 11]], [[1926]]</ref><ref name="1927 log">United States Numbered Highways, ''[[American Highways]]'' ([[American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials|AASHO]]), April 1927</ref> In the mid-1930s, much of New York's portion of the road became [[US 104]], and the part southeast of [[Littleton, New Hampshire]] to Portland, Maine became [[US 302]],{{Fact|date=October 2007}} but by far the longest piece was that followed by US 2 between St. Ignace and Bonners Ferry.

<!--the below should be in the state detail articles-->

===Michigan===
US-2 was in the original 1925 US Highway Plan by the Bureau of Public Roads<ref name=Droz1> {{cite web | last = Droz | first = Robert V. | title = U.S. Highways from U.S. 1 to (U.S. 830) | publisher = us-highways.com | date = 2007 | url = http://www.us-highways.com/us1830.htm| accessdate = 2008-01-23}}</ref> and was first commissioned in Michigan in 1926.<ref name=Bessert> {{cite web | last = Bessert | first = Christopher J. | title =Michigan Highways | url = http://www.michiganhighways.org/listings/MichHwys01-09.html| accessdate = 2008-01-30}}</ref> 

US-2 originally ran in Michigan from [[Ironwood, Michigan|Ironwood]] to [[St. Ignace, Michigan|St. Ignace]], the same termini as today. The highway has undergone many realignments, mostly minor, between those cities since 1926. In 1948, the eastern terminus in Michigan was extended to [[Sault Sainte Marie, Michigan|Sault Ste. Marie]] along Mackinac Trail.<ref name=Bessert> {{cite web | last = Bessert | first = Christopher J. | title =Michigan Highways | url = http://www.michiganhighways.org/listings/MichHwys01-09.html| accessdate = 2008-01-30}}</ref> 

In 1957, the first segment opened of a new freeway between St. Ignace and Sault Ste. Marie. It ran from Evergreen Shores, north of St. Ignace, to present-day [[M-123 (Michigan highway)|M-123]] and replaced the former route on State St. and Mackinac Trail. Over the next six years, US-2 was moved from Mackinac Trail onto the new freeway as new sections opened. Beginning in 1961, the freeway was concurrently signed as an extension of [[Interstate 75 (Michigan)|I-75]]. The freeway was completed in 1963.<ref name=Bessert> {{cite web | last = Bessert | first = Christopher J. | title =Michigan Highways | url = http://www.michiganhighways.org/listings/MichHwys01-09.html| accessdate = 2008-01-30}}</ref>  

The eastern terminus of US-2 in Michigan was truncated back to St. Ignace in 1983, removing it entirely from the I-75 freeway.<ref name=Bessert> {{cite web | last = Bessert | first = Christopher J. | title =Michigan Highways | url = http://www.michiganhighways.org/listings/MichHwys01-09.html| accessdate = 2008-01-30}}</ref>

===Eastern segment===
Before being designated as US 2, most of the current alignment was called '''[[New England Interstate Route]] 15''' from [[Danville, Vermont]] eastward to Maine. The portion of the old Route 15 that did not become part of US 2 was designated as [[Vermont Route 15]].{{Fact|date=August 2007}}

Other sections of US 2 in Vermont that were not part of New England Route 15 were parts of other former New England Interstate routes: Route 18 between [[Montpelier, Vermont|Montpelier]] and Danville; Route 14 between [[Burlington, Vermont|Burlington]] and Montpelier; and Route 30 between [[Alburgh (town), Vermont|Alburgh]] and Burlington.{{Fact|date=August 2007}}
