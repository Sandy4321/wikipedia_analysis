'''State Route 133''' (SR 133) is a [[state highway]] in the [[U.S. state]] of [[California]]. It connects [[SR 1 (CA)|SR 1]] in [[Laguna Beach, CA|Laguna Beach]] through the [[San Joaquin Hills]] with several [[freeway]]s in [[Irvine, CA|Irvine]], ending at the [[SR 241 (CA)|SR 241]] [[toll road]] in the latter city. The portion north of [[SR 73 (CA)|SR 73]] in Laguna Beach is part of the [[California Freeway and Expressway System]], and it is built as an [[expressway]] from SR 73 to Laguna Canyon Road (just south of [[I-405 (CA)|I-405]] in Irvine). SR 133 is a [[freeway]] (the '''Laguna Freeway''') to [[I-5 (CA)|I-5]], and a tollway (part of the [[Eastern Toll Road (California)|Eastern Toll Road]]) to SR 241 near the [[Santa Ana Mountains]].

SR 133 was constructed as a [[county road]] by the 1910s; the portion from I-405 to I-5 was upgraded to a freeway four decades later. Plans to extend the freeway south were canceled by the state, and the southern part of the road remains an undivided highway. In 1998, the majority of the [[Eastern Transportation Corridor]] opened, and the connector between I-5 and [[SR 241 (CA)|SR 241]] was designated as a toll extension of SR 133.

==Route description==
State Route 133 begins at the [[Pacific Coast Highway (California)|Pacific Coast Highway]] ([[California State Route 1|SR 1]]) as Broadway Street in [[Laguna Beach, California|Laguna Beach]], a block from the Pacific Ocean. The name changes to '''Laguna Canyon Road''' as the highway leaves downtown Laguna Beach and enters [[Laguna Canyon]], soon narrowing to one lane in each direction. After entering the canyon, which lies between [[Laguna Coast Wilderness Park]] (west side of SR 133) and [[Aliso and Wood Canyons Wilderness Park]] (east side of SR 133), the first major intersection is with [[El Toro Road]] ([[County Route S18 (California)|County Route S18]]). SR 133 widens to four lanes and becomes a highway after its interchange with the [[San Joaquin Hills Toll Road]] ([[California State Route 73|SR 73]]).<ref name=maps>[[Google Maps]] street maps and [[USGS]] [[topographic map]]s, accessed December 2007 via [http://mapper.acme.com/ ACME Mapper]</ref>

As it continues through the Laguna Coast Wilderness Park, SR 133 follows a four-lane alignment on the west side of the canyon, moved from the old two-lane road in the center of the canyon in late 2006. Laguna Canyon Road splits to the northwest where the canyon ends in [[Irvine, California|Irvine]]. North of the park, the highway becomes the '''Laguna Freeway''' after crossing an [[at-grade intersection]] with Laguna Canyon Road, followed by an interchange at exit 8, [[San Diego Freeway]] ([[Interstate 405 in California|I-405]]). SR 133 then continues as a freeway and serves Barranca Parkway and the [[Santa Ana Freeway]] ([[Interstate 5 in California|I-5]]). After crossing I-5, SR 133 becomes part of the [[Eastern Toll Road (California)|Eastern Toll Road]] along the northwest side of [[Marine Corps Air Station El Toro]], crossing an interchange with Irvine Boulevard at exit 12 before ending at [[California State Route 241|SR 241]]. [[Toll booth]]s are located on the south-facing ramps just north of Irvine Boulevard.<ref name=maps/>

==History==
As part of its construction of [[concrete road]]s, started by a 1913 [[bond issue]], [[Orange County, CA|Orange County]] paved the [[county road]] through [[Laguna Canyon]], connecting [[Legislative Route 2 (California pre-1964)|State Highway Route 2]] at [[Irvine, CA|Irvine]] with [[Laguna Beach, CA|Laguna Beach]], by 1917.<ref>Ben Blow, California Highways: A Descriptive Record of Road Development by the State and by Such Counties as Have Paved Highways, 1920 ([http://www.archive.org/details/californiahighwa00blowrich Archive.org] or [http://books.google.com/books?id=osgNAAAAYAAJ Google Books]), pp. 192-196</ref><ref>Official [[Automobile Blue Book]], [http://books.google.com/books?id=Mt0NAAAAYAAJ Volume Eight], 1918, p. 548</ref> The road was added to the state highway system in 1933 as '''Route 185''', an unsigned designation.<ref>{{cite CAstat|year=1933|ch=767|p=2040}}: "State Highway Route 60 near Laguna Beach to State Highway Route 2 near Irvine."</ref><ref>{{cite CAstat|year=1935|ch=29|p=286}}: "Route 185 is from Route 60 near Laguna Beach to Route 2 near Irvine."</ref> The entire route was added to the new [[California Freeway and Expressway System]] in 1959;<ref>{{cite CAstat|year=1959|ch=1062|p=3115}}</ref> the planned upgrade had already been named the '''Laguna Freeway''' by the [[California Highway Commission]] on November 26, 1957.<ref>[[California Department of Transportation]], [http://www.dot.ca.gov/hq/tsip/hseb/products/Named_Freeways.pdf 2007 Named Freeways, Highways, Structures and Other Appurtenances in California], p. 73</ref> The highway received a sign route number&mdash;'''State Route 133'''&mdash;in the [[1964 renumbering (California)|1964 renumbering]].<ref name=law-renumbering>{{cite CAstat|year=1963|ch=385|p=1182}}: "Route 133 is from Route 1 near Laguna Beach to Route 5 near Irvine."</ref>

Opening of the first&mdash;and only&mdash;piece of the Laguna Freeway was celebrated in Laguna Beach on October 1, 1952, connecting the north end of Laguna Canyon with a planned extension of the [[Santa Ana Freeway]] at a [[trumpet interchange]] and bypassing the old route on Sand Canyon Avenue. There were initially no other [[interchange (road)|interchange]]s along the route.<ref>[[Long Beach Press-Telegram]], Laguna Freeway Unit Dedication Oct. 1, September 29, 1952</ref><ref>[[Los Angeles Times]], Traffic Opens on Laguna Highway Unit, October 2, 1952, p.

A new [[California State Route 231 (1988-1996)|State Route 231]] was added to the state highway system in 1988, connecting [[I-5 (CA)|I-5]] northwest of Irvine with [[SR 91 (CA)|SR 91]],<ref>{{cite CAstat|year=1988|ch=1364|p=4561}}</ref> and in 1991 the south end was shifted southeast to the north end of SR 133, with the old route becoming [[SR 261 (CA)|SR 261]].<ref>{{cite CAstat|year=1991|ch=775|p=3483}}</ref> To prevent the route from changing numbers as it crossed I-5, the southern portion was renumbered SR 133 in 1996, with the remainder becoming an extended [[SR 241 (CA)|SR 241]].<ref name=1996-1154/> The [[Eastern Transportation Corridor]], which includes SR 133 north of I-5, was completed on October 15, 1998, opening a new shortcut from Orange County to the northeast.<ref>Megan Garvey, [[Los Angeles Times]], Latest Toll Road in O.C.
