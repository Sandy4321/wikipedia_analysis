'''Demosthenes''' ({{IPAc-en|lang|pron|d|<U+026A>|<U+02C8>|m|<U+0252>|s|.|<U+03B8>|<U+0259>|<U+02CC>|n|i<U+02D0>|z|}}<ref> [http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/Demosthenes "Demosthenes at dictionary.com"].</ref>, {{lang-el|<U+0394><U+03B7><U+03BC><U+03BF><U+03C3><U+03B8><U+03AD><U+03BD><U+03B7><U+03C2>, D<U+0113>mosth<U+00E9>n<U+0113>s}}, {{IPA-el|d<U+025B><U+02D0>most<U+02B0><U+00E9>n<U+025B><U+02D0>s|}}), (384<U+2013>322 [[Common Era|BC]]), was a prominent [[Greeks|Greek]] [[statesman]] and [[orator]] of [[History of Athens|ancient Athens]]. His [[oratory|oration]]s constitute a significant expression of contemporary Athenian intellectual prowess and provide an insight into the [[politics]] and culture of [[ancient Greece]] during the 4th century BC. Demosthenes learned [[rhetoric]] by studying the [[Speech (public address)|speeches]] of previous great orators.  He delivered his first judicial speeches at the age of 20, in which he argued effectively to gain from his guardians what was left of his inheritance. For a time, Demosthenes made his living as a professional speech-writer ([[Logographer (legal)|logographer]]) and a [[Ancient Greek law|lawyer]], writing speeches for use in private [[Lawsuit|legal suits]].

Demosthenes grew interested in politics during his time as a logographer, and in 354 BC he gave his first public political speeches. He went on to devote his most productive years to opposing [[Macedon]]'s expansion. He idealized his city and strove throughout his life to restore Athens' supremacy and motivate his compatriots against [[Philip II of Macedon]]. He sought to preserve his city's freedom and to establish an alliance against Macedon, in an unsuccessful attempt to impede Philip's plans to expand his influence southwards by conquering all the Greek states. After Philip's death, Demosthenes played a leading part in his city's uprising against the new King of Macedon, [[Alexander the Great]]. However, his efforts failed and the revolt was met with a harsh Macedonian reaction. To prevent a similar revolt against his own rule, Alexander's successor in this region, [[Antipater]], sent his men to track Demosthenes down. Demosthenes took his own life, in order to avoid being arrested by [[Archias]], Antipater's confidant.

The ''Alexandrian Canon'' compiled by [[Aristophanes of Byzantium]] and [[Aristarchus of Samothrace]] recognized Demosthenes as one of the ten greatest [[Attic orators]] and logographers. According to [[Longinus (literature)|Longinus]], Demosthenes "perfected to the utmost the tone of lofty speech, living passions, copiousness, readiness, speed".<ref>Longinus, ''On the Sublime'', 34.4</ref> [[Cicero]] acclaimed him as "the perfect orator" who lacked nothing, and [[Quintilian]] extolled him as ''lex orandi'' ("the standard of oratory") and that ''inter omnes unus excellat'' ("he stands alone among all the orators").<ref name="Cic35"> Cicero, ''Brutus'', 35</ref><ref name="Q76"> Quintillian, ''Institutiones'', X, 1, 6 and 76</ref>

As soon as Demosthenes came of age in 366 BC, he demanded they render an account of their management. According to Demosthenes, the account revealed the misappropriation of his property. Although his father left an estate of nearly fourteen [[Athenian Talent|talents]],<ref name="Aph4">Demosthenes, ''Against Aphobus 1'', [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0074;query=section%3D%23875;layout=;loc=27.3 4]</ref> (very  roughly  11,700 [[troy ounce]]s in silver or 150,000 current [[United States dollar]]s)<ref name="Helios">{{cite encyclopedia|title=Demosthenes|encyclopedia=Encyclopaedia The Helios|year=1952}}</ref> Demosthenes asserted his guardians had left nothing "except the house, and fourteen slaves and thirty silver minae" (30 minae = <U+00BD> talent).<ref name="Aph6">Demosthenes, ''Against Aphobus 1'', [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0074;query=section%3D%23877;layout=;loc=27.5 6]</ref> At the age of 20 Demosthenes sued his trustees in order to recover his patrimony and delivered five orations: three ''Against Aphobus'' during 363 BC and 362 BC and two ''Against Ontenor'' during 362 and 361 BC.

Between his coming of age in 366 BC and the trials that took place in 364 BC, Demosthenes and his guardians negotiated acrimoniously but were unable to reach an agreement, for neither side was willing to make concessions.<ref name="Helios" /> At the same time, Demosthenes prepared himself for the trials and improved his oratory skill. As an adolescent, his curiosity had been noticed by the orator [[Callistratus of Aphidnae|Callistratus]], who was then at the height of his reputation, having just won a case of considerable importance.<ref name="Pl5">Plutarch, ''Demosthenes'', 5</ref> According to [[Friedrich Nietzsche]], a German [[philology|philologist]] and [[philosophy|philosopher]], and [[Constantine Paparregopoulus]], a major Greek [[historian]], Demosthenes was a student of [[Isocrates]];<ref name="Nietzsche233-235">F.

It has also been said that Demosthenes paid Isaeus 10,000 [[drachma]]e (somewhat over 1.5 talents) on the condition that Isaeus should withdraw from a school of Rhetoric which he had opened, and should devote himself wholly to Demosthenes, his new pupil.<ref name="Jebb" /> Another version credits Isaeus with having taught Demosthenes without charge.<ref name="Suda">Suda, article [http://www.stoa.org/sol-bin/search.pl?login=guest&enlogin=guest&db=REAL&field=adlerhw_gr&searchstr=Iota,620 Isaeus]</ref> According to [[Sir Richard C. Jebb]], a British [[Classics|classical]] [[scholar]], "the intercourse between Isaeus and Demosthenes as teacher and learner can scarcely have been either very intimate or of very long duration".<ref name="Jebb" /> [[Konstantinos Tsatsos]], a Greek professor and [[academician]], believes that Isaeus helped Demosthenes edit his initial judicial orations against his guardians.<ref name="Tsatsos83">K. Tsatsos, ''Demosthenes'', 83</ref> Demosthenes is also said to have admired the historian Thucydides. In the ''Illiterate Book-Fancier,'' Lucian mentions eight beautiful copies of Thucydides made by Demosthenes, all in Demosthenes' own handwriting.<ref name="Lucian2">Lucian, ''The Illiterate Book-Fancier'', 4</ref> These references hint at his respect for a historian he must have assiduously studied.<ref name="Weil11">H. Weil, ''Biography of Demothenes'', 10<U+2013>11</ref>

According to [[Pseudo-Plutarch]], Demosthenes was married once. The only information about his wife, whose name is unknown, is that she was the daughter of Heliodorus, a prominent citizen.<ref name="pseudo13">Pseudo-Plutarch, ''Demosthenes'', 847c</ref> Demosthenes also had a daughter, "the only one who ever called him father", according to Aeschines' in a trenchant remark.<ref name="Ctesiphon77">Aeschines, ''Against Ctesiphon'', [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0002;query=section%3D%23457;layout=;loc=3.76 77]</ref> His daughter died young and unmarried a few days before Philip's death.<ref name="Ctesiphon77" />

====Accusations concerning personal life====
In his speeches, Aeschines often uses the [[Pederasty in ancient Greece|pederastic]] relations of Demosthenes to attack him. The essence of these attacks was not that Demosthenes had relations with boys, but that he had been an inadequate [[erastes|pederast]], one whose attentions did not benefit the boys, as would have been expected, but harmed them instead. In the case of Aristion, a youth from [[Plataea]] who lived for a long time in Demosthenes' house, Aeschines mocked him for lack of sexual restraint and possibly effeminate behavior: "Allegations about what [Aristion] was undergoing there, or doing what, vary, and it would be most unseemly for me to talk about it."<ref>Aeschines, ''Against Ctesiphon'', 162</ref> Another relationship which Aeschines brings up is that with Cnosion. His allegation, in this case, was also of a sexual nature. This time, however, he blamed Demosthenes for involving his wife by putting her in bed with the youth so as to get children by him.<ref>Aeschines, ''On the Embassy'', 149</ref> [[Athenaeus]], however, presents matters in a different light, claiming that his wife bedded the boy in a fit of jealousy.<ref name="AC">Athenaeus, ''Deipnosophistae'', XIII, [http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/Literature/Literature-idx?type=turn&entity=Literature.AthV3.p0134&isize=M&pview=hide 63]<br/>* C.A. Cox, ''Household Interests'', 202</ref>

Aeschines often asserted that Demosthenes made money out of young rich men. He claimed that he deluded Aristarchus, the son of Moschus, with the pretence that he could make him a great orator.<ref name="P15">A.W. Pickard, ''Demosthenes and the Last Days of Greek Freedom'', 15</ref> Apparently, while still under Demosthenes' tutelage, Aristarchus killed and mutilated a certain Nicodemus of Aphidna, gouging out his eyes and tongue. Aeschines accused Demosthenes of complicity in the murder, pointing out that Nicodemus had once pressed a lawsuit accusing Demosthenes of desertion. He also accused Demosthenes of having been such a bad [[erastes]] to Aristarchus so as not even to deserve the name. His crime, according to Aeschines, was to have betrayed his [[eromenos]] by  pillaging his estate, allegedly pretending to be in love with the youth so as to get his hands on the boy's inheritance. This he is said to have squandered, having taken three [[Talent (weight)|talents]] upon Aristarchus' fleeing into exile so as to avoid a trial. Thus, in payment for the trust that Aristarchus and his family put in him, "You entered a happy home [...]  you ruined it."<ref>Aeschines, ''On the Embassy,'' 148<U+2013>150, 165<U+2013>166</ref> Nevertheless, the story of Demosthenes' relations with Aristarchus is still regarded as more than doubtful, and no other pupil of Demosthenes is known by name.<ref name="P15" />

To make his living, Demosthenes became a professional [[litigant]] and logographer, writing speeches for use in private legal suits. He was so successful that he soon acquired wealthy and powerful clients. The Athenian logographer could remain anonymous, allowing him to serve personal interests, even if it prejudiced the client. Aeschines accused Demosthenes of unethically disclosing his clients' arguments to their opponents.<ref name="AischIII173">Aeschines, ''Against Ctesiphon'', [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0002;query=section%3D%23553;layout=;loc=3.172 173]</ref> He queried of Demosthenes: "And the born traitor<U+2014>how shall we recognize him? Will he not imitate you, Demosthenes, in his treatment of those whom chance throws in his way and who have trusted him? Will he not take pay for writing speeches for them to deliver in the courts, and then reveal the contents of these speeches to their opponents?"<ref name="AischII165">Aeschines, ''The Speech on the Embassy'', [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0002&query=section%3D%23361&layout=&loc=2.164 165]</ref>

As an example, Aeschines accused Demosthenes of writing a speech for Phormion, a wealthy banker, and then communicating it to Apollodorus, who was bringing a [[capital punishment|capital charge]] against Phormion.<ref name="AischII165" /> Plutarch  supported this accusation, stating that Demosthenes "was thought to have acted dishonorably".<ref name="Pl15">Plutarch, ''Demosthenes'', 15</ref>

==Early politics (354 BC<U+2013>350 BC)==
===Speech training===
[[Image:DemosthPracticing.jpg|thumb|right|''Demosthenes Practising Oratory'' by [[Jean-Jules-Antoine Lecomte du Nouy]] (1842<U+2013>1923). Demosthenes used to study in an underground room he constructed himself. He also used to talk with pebbles in his mouth and recited verses while running. To strengthen his voice, he spoke on the seashore over the roar of the waves.]]
Even before he turned 21-years-old in 363 BC, Demosthenes had already demonstrated an interest in politics.<ref name="Helios" /> In 363, 359, and 357 BC, he assumed the office of the [[trierarch]], being responsible for the outfitting and maintenance of a [[trireme]].<ref>A.W. Pickard, ''Demosthenes and the Last Days of Greek Freedom'', xiv-xv</ref> In 348 BC, he became a [[choregos (ancient Greece)|choregos]], paying the expenses of a [[Ancient Greek theatre|theatrical production]].<ref name="Usher226">S. Usher, ''Greek Oratory'', 226</ref>

Although Demosthenes said he never pleaded a single private case,<ref name="Zenothemis">Demosthenes, ''Against Zenothemis'', [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0076;query=section%3D%2346;layout=;loc=32.31 32]</ref> it remains unclear when and if Demosthenes abandoned the profitable but not so prestigious profession of logography.{{Ref_label|D|d|none}} According to Plutarch, when Demosthenes first addressed himself to the people, he was derided for his strange and uncouth style, "which was cumbered with long sentences and tortured with formal arguments to a most harsh and disagreeable excess".<ref name="Pl6">Plutarch, ''Demosthenes'', 6</ref>

Some citizens however discerned his talent. When he first left the [[Ecclesia (ancient Athens)|ecclesia]] (the Athenian Assembly) disheartened, an old man named Eunomus encouraged him, saying his diction was very much like that of [[Pericles]].<ref name="Pl6" /> Another time, after the ecclesia had refused to hear him and he was going home dejected, an actor named Satyrus followed him and entered into a friendly conversation with him.<ref name="Pl7">Plutarch, ''Demosthenes'', 7</ref>

As a boy Demosthenes had a [[speech impediment]]: an inarticulate and stammering pronunciation.<ref name="Britannica">{{cite encyclopedia|title=Demosthenes|encyclopedia=Encyclopaedia Britannica|year=2002}}</ref> Aeschines taunted him and referred to him in his speeches by the nickname "Batalus",{{Ref_label|E|e|none}} apparently invented by Demosthenes' pedagogues or by the little boys with whom he was playing.<ref name="AischI126">Aeschines, ''Against Timarchus'', [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0002;query=section%3D%23126;layout=;loc=1.127 126]</ref><ref name="AischII99">Aeschines, ''The Speech on the Embassy'', [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus:text:1999.01.0002:speech=2:section=99 99]</ref> According to Plutarch, he had a weakness in his voice of "a perplexed and indistinct utterance and a shortness of breath, which, by breaking and disjointing his sentences much obscured the sense and meaning of what he spoke."<ref name="Pl6" /> Demosthenes soon undertook a disciplined program to overcome these shortcomings and improve his elocution. He worked on his diction, his voice and his gestures.<ref name="Pl6-7">Plutarch, ''Demosthenes'', 6<U+2013>7</ref> His zeal and perseverance have passed into proverb. It is however unknown whether these vignettes are factual accounts of events in Demosthenes' life or merely anecdotes used to illustrate his perseverance and determination.<ref name="Helios" />

===Increased political activity===

Between 354 and 350 BC, Demosthenes continued practicing law privately while he was becoming increasingly interested in public affairs. He mostly remained a judicial orator, but started participating in the politics of the [[Athenian democracy]]. In 355 BC he wrote ''Against Androtion'' and in 354 BC ''Against Leptines'', two fierce attacks on individuals who attempted to repeal certain tax exemptions. In ''Against Timocrates'' and ''Against Aristocrates'' he advocated eliminating corruption. Demosthenes denounced measures <!-- by whom? "him", I presume. Resolve this ambiguity, please. -->regarded as dishonest or unworthy of Athenian traditions.<ref name = "Worthington29"/> All these speeches offer early glimpses of his general principles on foreign policy, such as the importance of the navy, of alliances and of national honor.<ref name="Romilly116-117">J.

In 354 BC, Demosthenes delivered his first political oration, ''On the Navy'', in which he espoused moderation and proposed the reform of "symmories"(boards) as a source of funding for the Athenian fleet.<ref name="Worthington29">I. Worthington, ''Demosthenes: Statesman and Orator'', 29</ref><ref name="Tsatsos88">K. Tsatsos, ''Demosthenes,'' 88</ref> In 352 BC, he delivered ''For the Megalopolitans'' and, in 351 BC, ''On the Liberty of the Rhodians.'' In both speeches he opposed  [[Eubulus (statesman)|Eubulus]], the most powerful Athenian statesman of the period 355 to 342 BC, who was against any intervention in the internal affairs of the other Greek cities.<ref>D. Phillips, ''Athenian Political Oratory'', 72</ref>

Although none of his early orations were successful, Demosthenes established himself as an important political personality and broke with Eubulus' faction, a prominent member of which was Aeschines. He laid the foundations for his future political successes and for becoming the leader of his own party.  His arguments revealed his desire to articulate Athens' needs and interests.<ref name="Habinek21">T. N. Habinek, ''Ancient Rhetoric and Oratory,'' 21</ref>

In 351 BC, Demosthenes felt strong enough to express his view concerning the most important foreign policy issue facing Athens at that time: the stance his city should take towards Philip II of Macedon. According to [[Jacqueline de Romilly]], a French philologist and member of the [[Acad<U+00E9>mie fran<U+00E7>aise]], the threat of Philip would give Demosthenes' stances a focus and a raison d'<U+00EA>tre.<ref name="Romilly116-117" /> Henceforth, Demosthenes' career is virtually the history of Athenian foreign policy.<ref name="Britannica" />

Most of Demosthenes' major orations were directed against the growing power of King Philip II of Macedon. Since 357 BC, when Philip seized [[Amphipolis]] and [[Pydna]], Athens had been formally at war with the [[ancient Macedonians|Macedonians]].<ref>D. Phillips, ''Athenian Political Oratory'', 69</ref> In 352 BC, Demosthenes characterized Philip as the very worst enemy of his city; his speech presaged the fierce attacks that Demosthenes would launch against the Macedonian king over the ensuing years.<ref name="Arist121">Demosthenes, ''Against Aristocrates'', [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0074;query=section%3D%23426;layout=;loc=23.122 121]</ref> A year later he criticized those dismissing Philip as a person of no account and warned that he was as dangerous as the King of [[Persia]].<ref name="Rhodians24">Demosthenes, ''For the Liberty of the Rhodians'', [[s:The Public Orations of Demosthenes/For the Freedom of the Rhodians#15:24|24]]</ref>

From this moment until 341 BC, all of Demosthenes' speeches referred to the same issue, the struggle against Philip. In 349 BC, Philip attacked [[Olynthus]], an ally of Athens. In the three ''Olynthiacs'', Demosthenes criticized his compatriots for being idle and urged Athens to help Olynthus.<ref name="OlynthII23">Demosthenes, ''Second Olynthiac'', [[s:The Public Orations of Demosthenes/Olynthiac II#2:3|3]]</ref><ref name="OlynthI3">Demosthenes, ''First Olynthiac'', [[s:The Public Orations of Demosthenes/Olynthiac I#1:3|3]]</ref> He also insulted Philip by calling him a "barbarian".{{Ref_label|G|g|none}} Despite Demosthenes' warnings, the Athenians engaged in a useless war in [[Euboea]] and offered no military support to Olynthus.<ref name="Peace5">Demosthenes, ''On the Peace'', [[s:The Public Orations of Demosthenes/On the Peace#5:5|5]]</ref>

In 348 BC a peculiar event occurred: [[Meidias]], a wealthy Athenian, publicly slapped Demosthenes, who was at the time a choregos at the [[Dionysia|Greater Dionysia]], a large religious festival in honour of the god [[Dionysus]].<ref name="Usher226" /> Meidias was a friend of Eubulus and supporter of the unsuccessful excursion in Euboea.<ref name="Peace5" /> He also was an old enemy of Demosthenes; in 361 BC he had broken violently into his house, with his brother Thrasylochus, to take possession of it.<ref name="Meidias223">Demosthenes, ''Against Meidias'', [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0074&layout=&loc=21.78 78<U+2013>80]</ref>

Demosthenes decided to prosecute his wealthy opponent and wrote the judicial oration ''Against Meidias''. This speech gives valuable information about Athenian law at the time and especially about the Greek concept of [[Hubris|hybris]] (aggravated assault), which was regarded as a crime not only against the city but against society as a whole.<ref>H. Yunis, ''The Rhetoric of Law in 4th Century Athens'', 206</ref> He stated that a democratic state perishes if the [[rule of law]] is undermined by wealthy and unscrupulous men, and that the citizens acquire power and authority in all state affairs due "to the strength of the laws".<ref name="Meidias223">Demosthenes, ''Against Meidias'', [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0074&layout=&loc=21.223 223]</ref> According to philologist [[Henri Weil]], Demosthenes dropped the charges for political reasons and never delivered ''Against Meidias'',<ref name="Weil28">H.

===Peace of Philocrates (347<U+2013>345 BC)===
{{details|Peace of Philocrates}}
In 348 BC, Philip conquered Olynthus and razed it to the ground; then conquered the entire [[Chalcidice]] and all the states of the Chalcidic federation that Olynthus had once led.<ref name="PhilippicIII56">Demosthenes, ''Third Philippic'', [[s:The Public Orations of Demosthenes/Philippic III#9:56|56]]</ref> After these Macedonian victories, Athens sued for peace with Macedon. Demosthenes was among those who favored compromise. In 347 BC, an Athenian delegation, comprising Demosthenes, Aeschines and Philocrates, was officially sent to [[Pella]] to negotiate a peace treaty. In his first encounter with Philip, Demosthenes is said to have collapsed from fright.<ref name="Aeschines34">Aeschines, ''The Speech on the Embassy'', [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0002;query=section%3D%23230;layout=;loc=2.33 34]</ref>

The ecclesia officially accepted the harsh terms Phillip imposed. However, when an Athenian delegation arrived at Pella to put Phillip under oath, which was required to conclude the treaty, he was campaigning abroad.<ref name="PhilippicIII15">Demosthenes, ''Third Philippic'', [[s:The Public Orations of Demosthenes/Philippic III#9:15|15]]</ref> He expected that he would hold safely any Athenian possessions which he might seize before the ratification.<ref name="Crown25-27">Demosthenes, ''On the Crown'', [[s:The Public Orations of Demosthenes/On the Crown#18:25|25<U+2013>27]]</ref> Being very anxious about the delay, Demosthenes insisted that the embassy should travel to the place where they would find Philip and swear him in without delay.<ref name="Crown25-27" /> Despite his suggestions, the Athenian envoys, including himself and Aeschines, remained in Pella, until Philip successfully concluded his campaign in [[Thrace]].<ref name="Crown30">Demosthenes, ''On the Crown'', [[s:The Public Orations of Demosthenes/On the Crown#18:30|30]]</ref>

Finally, peace was sworn at [[Pherae]], but Demosthenes accused the other envoys of venality.<ref name="Crown31">Demosthenes, ''On the Crown'', [[s:The Public Orations of Demosthenes/On the Crown#18:31|31]]</ref> Just after the conclusion of the Peace of Philocrates, Philip passed Thermopylae, and subdued [[Phocis]]; Athens made no move to support the Phocians.<ref name="Crown36">Demosthenes, ''On the Crown'', [[s:The Public Orations of Demosthenes/On the Crown#18:36|36]]</ref><ref name="Peace10">Demosthenes, ''On the Peace'', [[s:The Public Orations of Demosthenes/On the Peace#5:10|10]]</ref> Supported by [[Thebes, Greece|Thebes]] and [[Thessaly]], Macedon took control of Phocis' votes in the [[Amphictyonic League]], a Greek religious organization formed to support the greater temples of [[Apollo]] and [[Demeter]].<ref name="Crown43">Demosthenes, ''On the Crown'', [[s:The Public Orations of Demosthenes/On the Crown#18:43|43]]</ref> Despite some reluctance on the part of the Athenian leaders, Athens finally accepted Philip's entry into the Council of the League.<ref name="Embassy111-113">Demosthenes, ''On the False Embassy'', [[s:The Public Orations of Demosthenes/On the Embassy#19:111|111<U+2013>113]]</ref> Demosthenes was among those who recommended this stance in his oration ''[[On the Peace]]''.

===Second and Third Philippics (344<U+2013>341 BC)===
[[Image:Gallipoli peninsula from space.png|thumb|Satellite image of the Thracian Chersonese and the surrounding area. The Chersonese became the focus of a bitter territorial dispute between Athens and Macedon. It was eventually ceded to Philip in 338 BC.]]
:For more details on this topic, see [[Second Philippic]], [[On the Chersonese]], [[Third Philippic]]
In 344 BC Demosthenes travelled to the [[Peloponnese]], in order to detach as many cities as possible from Macedon's influence, but his efforts were generally unsuccessful.<ref name="PhilippicII19">Demosthenes, ''Second Philippic'', [[s:The Public Orations of Demosthenes/Philippic II#6:19|19]]</ref> Most of the Peloponnesians saw Philip as the guarantor of their freedom and sent a joint embassy to Athens to express their grievances against Demosthenes' activities.<ref name="Buckley">T. Buckley, ''Aspects of Greek History 750-323 BC,'' 480</ref> In response, Demosthenes delivered the ''Second Philippic'', a vehement attack against Philip.  In 343 BC Demosthenes delivered ''[[On the False Embassy]]'' against Aeschines, who was facing a charge of high treason. Nonetheless, Aeschines was acquitted by the narrow margin of thirty votes by a [[jury]] which may have numbered as many as 1,501.<ref>Pseudo-Plutarch, ''Aeschines,'' 840c</ref>

In 343 BC, Macedonian forces were conducting campaigns in [[Epirus (region)|Epirus]] and, in 342 BC, Philip campaigned in [[Thrace]].<ref name="PhilippicIII17">Demosthenes, ''Third Philippic'', [[s:The Public Orations of Demosthenes/Philippic III#9:17|17]]</ref> He also negotiated with the Athenians an amendment to the Peace of Philocrates.<ref name="Halonnesus18">Demosthenes (or Hegesippus), ''On Halonnesus,'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0070;query=section%3D%23226;layout=;loc=7.17 18<U+2013>23]</ref> When the Macedonian army approached [[Thracian Chersonese|Chersonese]] (now known as the [[Gallipoli Peninsula]]), an Athenian general named [[Diopeithes]] ravaged the maritime district of Thrace, thereby inciting Philip's rage. Because of this turbulence, the Athenian Assembly convened. Demosthenes delivered ''On the Chersonese'' and convinced the Athenians not to recall Diopeithes. Also in 342 BC, he delivered the ''Third Philippic'', which is considered to be the best of his political orations.<ref name="Tsatsos245">K. Tsatsos, ''Demosthenes'', 245</ref>  Using all the power of his eloquence, he demanded resolute action against Philip and called for a burst of energy from the Athenian people. He told them that it would be "better to die a thousand times than pay court to Philip".<ref>Demosthenes, ''Third Philippic'', [[s:The Public Orations of Demosthenes/Philippic III#9:65|65]]</ref> Demosthenes now dominated Athenian politics and was able to considerably weaken the pro-Macedonian faction of Aeschines.

===Battle of Chaeronea (338 BC)===
{{details|Battle of Chaeronea (338 BC)}}
[[Image:Chaeronea map.gif|thumb|right|The battle of Chaeronea (map designed by [http://www.livius.org/aj-al/alexander/alexander_pic/alexander_pics.html Marco Prins and Jona Lendering]) took place the autumn of 338 BC and resulted in a significant victory for Philip, who established Macedon's supremacy over the Greek cities.]]
In 341 BC Demosthenes was sent to [[Byzantium]], where he sought to renew its alliance with Athens. Thanks to Demosthenes' diplomatic manoeuvres [[Abydos, Hellespont|Abydos]] also entered into an alliance with Athens. These developments worried Philip and increased his anger at Demosthenes. The Athenian Assembly, however, laid aside Philip's grievances against Demosthenes' conduct and denounced the peace treaty; so doing, in effect, amounted to an official declaration of war. In 339 BC Philip made his last and most effective bid to conquer southern [[Greece]], assisted by Aeschines' stance in the Amphictyonic Council.<ref name="On the Crown149">Demosthenes, ''On the Crown'', [[s:The Public Orations of Demosthenes/On the Crown#18:149|149]]</ref> During a meeting of the Council, Philip accused the [[Amfissa|Amfissian]] [[Locris|Locrians]] of intruding on consecrated ground.<ref name="On the Crown150">Demosthenes, ''On the Crown'', [[s:The Public Orations of Demosthenes/On the Crown#18:150|150]]</ref> The presiding officer of the Council, a Thessalian named Cottyphus, proposed the convocation of an Amphictyonic Congress to inflict a harsh punishment upon the Locrians.<ref name="On the Crown151">Demosthenes, ''On the Crown'', [[s:The Public Orations of Demosthenes/On the Crown#18:151|151]]</ref> Aeschines agreed with this proposition and maintained that the Athenians should participate in the Congress.<ref name="On the Crown151" /> Demosthenes however reversed Aeschines' initiatives and Athens finally abstained.<ref name="Carey">C. Carey, ''Aeschines,'' 12<U+2013>14</ref> After the failure of a first military excursion against the Locrians, the summer session of the Amphictyonic Council gave command of the league's forces to Philip and asked him to lead a second excursion.<ref name="On the Crown152">Demosthenes, ''On the Crown'', [[s:The Public Orations of Demosthenes/On the Crown#18:152|152]]</ref> Philip decided to act at once; in the winter of 339<U+2013>338 BC, he passed through Thermopylae, entered Amfissa and defeated the Locrians. After this significant victory, Philip swiftly entered Phocis in 338 BC. He then turned south-east down the [[Cephissus (Athenian plain)|Cephissus]] valley, seized [[Elateia]], and restored the fortifications of the city.<ref name="On the Crown152" />

At the same time, Athens orchestrated the creation of an alliance with Euboea, [[Megara]], [[Achaea]], [[Corinth]], [[Acarnania]] and other states in the Peloponnese. However the most desirable ally for Athens was Thebes. To secure their allegiance, Demosthenes was sent, by Athens, to the Boeotian city; Philip also sent a deputation, but Demosthenes succeeded in securing Thebes' allegiance.<ref name="On the Crown153">Demosthenes, ''On the Crown'', [[s:The Public Orations of Demosthenes/On the Crown#18:153|153]]</ref> Demosthenes' oration before the Theban people is not extant and, therefore, the arguments he used to convince the Thebans remain unknown. In any case, the alliance came at a price: Thebes' control of Boeotia was recognized, Thebes was to command solely on land and jointly at sea, and Athens was to pay two thirds of the campaign's cost.<ref name="Rhodes317">P.J. Rhodes, ''A History of the Classical World'', 317</ref>

While the Athenians and the Thebans were preparing themselves for war, Philip made a final attempt to appease his enemies, proposing in vain a new peace treaty.<ref name="Pl18">Plutarch, ''Demosthenes,'' 18</ref> After a few trivial encounters between the two sides, which resulted in minor Athenian victories, Philip drew the [[Phalanx formation|phalanx]] of the Athenian and Theban confederates into a plain near [[Chaeronea]], where he defeated them. Demosthenes fought as a mere [[hoplite]].{{Ref_label|H|h|none}} Such was Philip's hatred for Demosthenes that, according to [[Diodorus Siculus]], the King after his victory sneered at the misfortunes of the Athenian statesman. However, the Athenian orator and statesman [[Demades]] is said to have remarked: "O King, when Fortune has cast you in the role of [[Agamemnon]], are you not ashamed to act the part of [[Thersites]]? [an obscene soldier of the Greek army during the [[Trojan War]]]" Stung by these words, Philip immediately altered his demeanour.<ref name="DiodXVI87">Diodorus, ''Library,'' XVI [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0084&query=chapter%3D%23665&layout=&loc=16.86.1 87]</ref>

==Last political initiatives and death==
===Confrontation with Alexander===
[[Image:BattleofIssus333BC-mosaic-detail1.jpg|thumb|[[Alexander Mosaic]] from [[Pompeii]], from a 3rd century BC original Greek painting, now lost. In 336<U+2013>335 BC, the King of Macedon crippled any attempt of the Greek cities at resistance and shattered Demosthenes' hopes for Athenian independence.]]
After Chaeronea, Philip inflicted a harsh punishment upon Thebes, but made peace with Athens on very lenient terms. Demosthenes encouraged the fortification of Athens and was chosen by the ecclesia to deliver the [[Demosthenes' Funeral Oration|Funeral Oration]].<ref name="On the Crown299">Demosthenes, ''On the Crown'', [[s:The Public Orations of Demosthenes/On the Crown#18:299|299]]</ref><ref name="On the Crown285">Demosthenes, ''On the Crown'', [[s:The Public Orations of Demosthenes/On the Crown#18:285|285]]</ref> In 337 BC, Philip created the [[League of Corinth]], a confederation of Greek states under his leadership, and returned to Pella.<ref>L.A. Tritle, ''The Greek World in the Fourth Century'', 123</ref> In 336 BC, Philip was assassinated at the wedding of his daughter, Cleopatra of Macedonia, to King [[Alexander I of Epirus|Alexander of Epirus]]. After Philip's death, the army proclaimed Alexander, then aged twenty, as the new King of Macedon. Greek cities like Athens and Thebes saw in this change of leadership an opportunity to regain their full independence. Demosthenes celebrated Philip's assassination and played a leading part in his city's uprising. According to Aeschines, "it was but the seventh day after the death of his daughter, and though the ceremonies of mourning were not yet completed, he put a garland on his head and white raiment on his body, and there he stood making thank-offerings, violating all decency."<ref name="Ctesiphon77" /> Demosthenes also sent envoys to [[Attalus (general)|Attalus]], whom he considered to be an internal opponent of Alexander.<ref>P. Green, ''Alexander of Macedon,'' 119</ref> Nonetheless, Alexander moved swiftly to Thebes, which submitted shortly after his appearance at its gates. When the Athenians learned that Alexander had moved quickly to Boeotia, they panicked and begged the new King of Macedon for mercy. Alexander admonished them but imposed no punishment.

In 335 BC Alexander felt free to engage the [[Thracians]] and the [[Illyrians]]. While he was campaigning in the north, the Thebans and the Athenians rebelled once again, believing rumors that Alexander was dead. [[Darius III of Persia]] financed the Greek cities that rose up against Macedon, and Demosthenes is said to have received about 300 talents on behalf of Athens and to have faced accusations of embezzlement.{{Ref_label|I|i|none}} Alexander reacted immediately and razed Thebes to the ground. He did not attack Athens, but demanded the exile of all anti-Macedonian politicians, Demosthenes first of all. According to [[Plutarch]], a special Athenian embassy led by [[Phocion]], an opponent of the anti-Macedonian faction, was able to persuade Alexander to relent.<ref name="Phocion">Plutarch, ''Phocion'', 17</ref>

Despite the unsuccessful ventures against Philip and Alexander, the Athenians still respected Demosthenes. In 336 BC, the orator Ctesiphon proposed that Athens honor Demosthenes for his services to the city by presenting him, according to custom, with a golden crown. This proposal became a political issue and, in 330 BC, Aeschines prosecuted Ctesiphon on charges of legal irregularities. In his most brilliant speech,<ref name="Tsatsos301">K. Tsatsos, ''Demosthenes,'' 301 and ''The Helios''</ref> ''On the Crown,'' Demosthenes effectively defended Ctesiphon and vehemently attacked those who would have preferred peace with Macedon. He was unrepentant about his past actions and policies and insisted that, when in power, the constant aim of his policies was the honor and the ascendancy of his country; and on every occasion and in all business he preserved his loyalty to Athens.<ref name="Cr321">Demosthenes, ''On the Crown'', [[s:The Public Orations of Demosthenes/On the Crown#18:321|321]]</ref> He finally defeated Aeschines, although his enemy's objections to the crowning were arguably valid from a legal point of view.<ref name="Duncan">A.

===Case of Harpalus===
{{details|Harpalus}}
In 324 BC Harpalus, to whom Alexander had entrusted huge treasures, absconded and sought refuge in Athens. Demosthenes, at first, advised that he be chased out of the city.<ref name="Pl25">Plutarch, ''Demosthenes,'' 25</ref> Finally, Harpalus was imprisoned despite the dissent of [[Hypereides]], an anti-Macedonian statesman and former ally of Demosthenes.<ref name="Hypereides">Hypereides, ''Against Demosthenes,'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0140%3Aspeech%3D5#anch4 1]</ref> The ecclesia, after a proposal of Demosthenes, decided to take control of Harpalus' money, which was entrusted to a committee presided over by Demosthenes.<ref name="Hypereides" /> When the committee counted the treasure, they found they only had half the money Harpalus had declared he had.<ref name="Hypereides" /> Nevertheless, they decided not to disclose the deficit. When Harpalus escaped, the [[Areopagus]] conducted an inquiry and charged Demosthenes with mishandling twenty talents. During Demosthenes' trial, Hypereides argued that he did not disclose the huge deficit, because he was bribed by Harpalus.<ref name="Hypereides" /> Demosthenes was fined and imprisoned, but he soon escaped.<ref name="Pl26">Plutarch, ''Demosthenes,'' 26</ref> It remains unclear whether the accusations against him were just or not.{{Ref_label|J|j|none}} In any case, the Athenians soon repealed the sentence.<ref name="Pl27">Plutarch, ''Demosthenes,'' 27</ref>

After Alexander's death in 323 BC, Demosthenes again urged the Athenians to seek independence from Macedonia in what became known as the [[Lamian War]]. However, Antipater, Alexander's successor, quelled all opposition and demanded that the Athenians turn over Demosthenes and Hypereides, among others. Following his request, the ecclesia adopted a decree condemning the most prominent anti-Macedonian agitators to death. Demosthenes escaped to a sanctuary on the island of [[Poros|Calauria]] (modern-day [[Poros]]), where he was later discovered by Archias, a confidant of Antipater. He committed suicide before his capture by taking poison out of a reed, pretending he wanted to write a letter to his family.<ref name="Pl29">Plutarch, ''Demosthenes,'' 29</ref> When Demosthenes felt that the poison was working on his body, he said to Archias: "Now, as soon as you please you may commence the part of [[Creon]] in the tragedy, and cast out this body of mine unburied. But, O gracious Neptune, I, for my part, while I am yet alive, arise up and depart out of this sacred place; though Antipater and the Macedonians have not left so much as the temple unpolluted." After saying these words, he passed by the altar, fell down and died.<ref name="Pl29" /> Years after Demosthenes' suicide, the Athenians erected a statue to honor him and decreed that the state should provide meals to his descendants in the [[Prytaneum]].<ref name="pseudo14">Pseudo-Plutarch, ''Demosthenes,'' 847d</ref>

==Assessments==
===Political career===
Plutarch lauds Demosthenes for not being of a fickle disposition. Rebutting historian [[Theopompus]], the biographer insists that for "the same party and post in politics which he held from the beginning, to these he kept constant to the end; and was so far from leaving them while he lived, that he chose rather to forsake his life than his purpose".<ref name="Pl13">Plutarch, ''Demosthenes'', 13</ref> On the other hand, [[Polybius]], a Greek historian of the [[Mediterranean Basin|Mediterranean world]], was highly critical of Demosthenes' policies. Polybius accused him of having launched unjustified verbal attacks on great men of other cities, branding them unjustly as traitors to the Greeks. The historian maintains that Demosthenes measured everything by the interests of his own city, imagining that all the Greeks ought to have their eyes fixed upon Athens. According to Polybius, the only thing the Athenians eventually got by their opposition to Philip was the defeat at Chaeronea. "And had it not been for the king's magnanimity and regard for his own reputation, their misfortunes would have gone even further, thanks to the policy of Demosthenes".<ref name="Polybius">Polybius, ''Histories'', [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0234%3Aid%3Db18c14 13]</ref>

| style="text-align: left;" | "The man who deems himself born only to his parents will wait for his natural and destined end; the son of his country is willing to die rather than see her enslaved, and will look upon those outrages and indignities, which a commonwealth in subjection is compelled to endure, as more dreadful than death itself."

| style="text-align: left;" | Demosthenes (''On the Crown'', 205) - During his long political career Demosthenes urged his countrymen to defend their city and to preserve their freedom and their democracy.

Paparregopoulus extols Demosthenes' patriotism, but criticizes him as being short-sighted. According to this critique, Demosthenes should have understood that the ancient Greek states could only survive unified under the leadership of Macedon.<ref name="Paparrigopoulos396-398" /> Therefore, Demosthenes is accused of misjudging events, opponents and opportunities and of being unable to foresee Philip's inevitable triumph.<ref name="Carey" /> He is criticized for having overrated Athens' capacity to revive and challenge Macedon.<ref name = "Tsatsos318-326"/> His city had lost most of its Aegean allies, whereas Philip had consolidated his hold over [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]] and was master of enormous mineral wealth. Chris Carey, a professor of Greek in [[University College London|UCL]], concludes that Demosthenes was a better orator and political operator than strategist.<ref name="Carey" /> Nevertheless, the same scholar underscores that "pragmatists" like Aeschines or Phocion had no inspiring vision to rival that of Demosthenes. The orator asked the Athenians to choose that which is just and honorable, before their own safety and preservation.<ref name="Pl13" /> The people preferred Demosthenes' activism and even the bitter defeat at Chaeronea was regarded as a price worth paying in the attempt to retain freedom and influence.<ref name="Carey" /> According to Professor of Greek Arthur Wallace Pickard-Cambridge, success may be a poor criterion for judging the actions of people like Demosthenes, who were motivated by the ideal of political liberty.<ref name="Pickard">A.W. Pickard, ''Demosthenes and the Last Days of Greek Freedom ,'' 490</ref> Athens was asked by Philip to sacrifice its freedom and its democracy, while Demosthenes longed for the city's brilliance.<ref name="Tsatsos318-326">K. Tsatsos, ''Demosthenes,'' 318<U+2013>326</ref> He endeavored to revive its imperilled values and, thus, he became an "educator of the people" (in the words of [[Werner Jaeger]]).<ref name="Romilly120-122">J. De Romilly, ''A Short History of Greek Literature,'' 120<U+2013>122</ref>

The fact that Demosthenes fought at the battle of Chaeronea as a [[hoplite]] indicates that he lacked any military skills. According to historian [[Thomas Babington Macaulay]], in his time the division between political and military offices was beginning to be strongly marked.<ref name="Macaulay">T.B. Macaulay, ''On Mitford's History of Greece,'' 136</ref> Almost no politician, with the exception of [[Phocion]], was at the same time an apt orator and a competent [[general]]. Demosthenes dealt in policies and ideas, and war was not his business.<ref name="Macaulay" /> This contrast between Demosthenes' intellectual prowess and his deficiencies in terms of vigor, stamina, military skill<ref name="Paparrigopoulos396-398" /> and strategic vision<ref name="Carey" /> is illustrated by the inscription his countrymen engraved on the base of his statue:<ref name="Pl30">Plutarch, ''Demosthenes'', 30</ref>

According to [[Dionysius of Halicarnassus]], a Greek historian and teacher of rhetoric, Demosthenes represented the final stage in the development of Attic prose. Dionysius asserts that Demosthenes brought together the best features of the basic types of style; he used the middle or normal type style ordinarily and applied the archaic type and the type of plain elegance where they were fitting. In each one of the three types he was better than its special masters.<ref name="Dionysius46">Dionysius, ''On the Admirable Style of Demosthenes,'' 46</ref> He is, therefore, regarded as a consummate orator, adept in the techniques of oratory, which are brought together in his work.<ref name="Romilly120-122" /> In his initial judicial orations, the influence of both [[Lysias]] and Isaeus is obvious, but his marked, original style is already revealed.<ref name="Jebb" /><ref name="Tsatsos86">K. Tsatsos, ''Demosthenes,'' 86</ref>

According to the classical scholar Harry Thurston Peck, Demosthenes "affects no learning; he aims at no elegance; he seeks no glaring ornaments; he rarely touches the heart with a soft or melting appeal, and when he does, it is only with an effect in which a third-rate speaker would have surpassed him. He had no wit, no humour, no vivacity, in our acceptance of these terms. The secret of his power is simple, for it lies essentially in the fact that his political principles were interwoven with his very spirit."<ref name="Thurston" /> In this judgement, Peck agrees with Jaeger, who said that the imminent political decision imbued the Demosthenes' speech with a fascinating artistic power.<ref>W. Jaeger, ''Demosthenes,'' 123<U+2013>124</ref> Demosthenes was apt at combining abruptness with the extended period, brevity with breadth. Hence, his style harmonizes with his fervent commitment.<ref name="Romilly120-122" /> His language is simple and natural, never far-fetched or artificial. According to Jebb, Demosthenes was a true artist who could make his art obey him.<ref name="Jebb" /> For his part, Aeschines stigmatized his intensity, attributing to his rival strings of absurd and incoherent images.<ref name="Ctesiphon166">Aeschines, ''Against Ctesiphon,'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0002&query=section%3D%23546&layout=&loc=3.165 166]</ref> Dionysius stated that Demosthenes' only shortcoming is the lack of humor, although Quintilian regards this deficiency as a virtue.<ref name="Dionysius56">Dionysius, ''On the Admirable Style of Demosthenes'', 56</ref><ref name="Q2"> Quintillian, ''Institutiones,'' VI, 3, 2</ref> The main criticism of Demosthenes' art, however, seems to have rested chiefly on his known reluctance to speak extempore;<ref name="Hermippos"> J. Bollansie, ''Hermippos of Smyrna'', 415</ref> he often declined to comment on subjects he had not studied beforehand.<ref name="Thurston" /> However, he gave the most elaborate preparation to all his speeches and, therefore, his arguments were the products of careful study. He was also famous for his caustic wit.<ref name="Pl8"> Plutarch, ''Demosthenes,'' 8</ref>

According to Cicero, Demosthenes regarded "delivery" (gestures, voice etc.) as more important than style.<ref name="Cic38"> Cicero, ''Brutus,'' 38, 142</ref> Although he lacked Aeschines' charming voice and Demades's skill at improvisation, he made efficient use of his body to accentuate his words.<ref name="Nietzsche233-235" /> Thus he managed to project his ideas and arguments much more forcefully. Nonetheless, his delivery was not accepted by everybody in antiquity: [[Demetrius Phalereus]] and the comedians ridiculed Demosthenes' "theatricality", whilst Aeschines regarded Leodamas of [[Acharnae]] as superior to him.<ref name="Pl9-11"> Plutarch, ''Demosthenes,'' 9<U+2013>11</ref><ref name="Ctesiphon139">Aeschines, ''Against Ctesiphon'', [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus:text:1999.01.0002&query=section%3D%23519 139]</ref>

Demosthenes' fame continued down the ages. The scholars at the [[Library of Alexandria]] carefully edited the manuscripts of his speeches, and [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] schoolboys studied his art as part of their own oratorical training.<ref name="Britannica" /> [[Satires of Juvenal|Juvenal]] acclaimed him as "largus et exundans ingenii fons" (a large and overflowing fountain of genius),<ref name="Juvenal">Juvenal, ''Satura,'' X, 119</ref> and he inspired Cicero's speeches against [[Mark Antony]], also called the [[Philippic]]s. Plutarch drew attention in his ''Life of Demosthenes'' to the strong similarities between the personalities and careers of Demosthenes and Marcus Tullius Cicero:<ref name="Pl3">Plutarch, ''Demosthenes,'' 3</ref>

{{cquote|The divine power seems originally to have designed Demosthenes and Cicero upon the same plan, giving them many similarities in their natural characters, as their passion for distinction and their love of liberty in civil life, and their want of courage in dangers and war, and at the same time also to have added many accidental resemblances. I think there can hardly be found two other orators, who, from small and obscure beginnings, became so great and mighty; who both contested with kings and tyrants; both lost their daughters, were driven out of their country, and returned with honor; who, flying from thence again, were both seized upon by their enemies, and at last ended their lives with the liberty of their countrymen.}}

During the [[Middle Ages]] and [[Renaissance]], Demosthenes had a reputation for eloquence.<ref name="Britannica" /> He was read more than any other ancient orator; only Cicero offered any real competition.<ref>G. Gibson, ''Interpreting a Classic'', 1</ref> French author and lawyer [[Guillaume du Vair]] praises his speeches for their artful arrangement and elegant style; [[John Jewel]], [[Bishop of Salisbury]], and [[Jacques Amyot]], a French Renaissance writer and translator, regard Demosthenes as a great or even the "supreme" orator.<ref>W. A. Rebhorn, ''Renaissance Debates on Rhetoric'', 139, 167, 258</ref>

In [[modern history]], orators such as [[Henry Clay]] would [[imitation|mimic]] Demosthenes' technique. His ideas and principles survived, influencing prominent politicians and movements of our times. Hence, he constituted a source of inspiration for the authors of the [[Federalist Papers]] (series of 85 articles arguing for the ratification of the [[United States Constitution]]) and for the major orators of the [[French Revolution]].<ref name="Tsatsos352">K. Tsatsos, ''Demosthenes,'' 352</ref> French Prime Minister [[Georges Clemenceau]] was among those who idealized Demosthenes and wrote a book about him.<ref name="Marcu">V. Marcu, ''Men and Forces of Our Time,'' 32</ref> For his part, Friedrich Nietzsche often composed his sentences according to the paradigms of Demosthenes, whose style he admired.<ref name="Tongeren">P.J.M. Van Tongeren, ''Reinterpreting Modern Culture,'' 92</ref><ref name="Beyond">F. Nietzsche, ''Beyond Good and Evil,'' 247</ref> During [[World War II]], the fighters of the [[French Resistance]] identified themselves with Demosthenes, and [[Adolf Hitler]] with Philip.

[[Advertising]] executive [[David Ogilvy]] frequently cited Demosthenes as a model for creating persuasive advertising, saying, "When Aeschines spoke, they said, <U+2018>How well he speaks.<U+2019> But when Demosthenes spoke, they said, <U+2018>Let us march against Philip.<U+2019>"<ref name="Ogilvy">David Ogilvy, ''Ogilvy on Advertising,'' New York: Random House, 1983.</ref>

The [[Demosthenian Literary Society]] at the [[University of Georgia|The University of Georgia]] is named after Demosthenes, as a tribute to his oratorical ability and the manner in which he improved his speaking ability.

{{details|Works of Demosthenes}}
It seems that Demosthenes published many or all of his orations.<ref name="Weil66-67">H. Weil, ''Biography of Demosthenes,'' 66<U+2013>67</ref> After his death, texts of his speeches survived in Athens and the [[Library of Alexandria]]. In Alexandria these texts were incorporated into the body of classical Greek literature that was preserved, catalogued and studied by scholars of the [[Hellenistic civilization|Hellenistic]] period. From then until the 4th century AD, copies of his orations multiplied and they were in a relatively good position to survive the tense period from the 6th until the 9th century AD.<ref name="Yunis28">H. Yunis, "Demosthenes: On the Crown," 28</ref> In the end, sixty-one of Demosthenes' orations survived till the present day. [[Friedrich Blass]], a German classical scholar, believes that nine more speeches were recorded by the orator, but they are not extant.<ref name="Blass1">F. Blass, ''Die attische Beredsamkeit,'' III, 2, 60</ref>  Modern editions of these speeches are based on four [[manuscript]]s of the 10th and 11th centuries AD.<ref name="Gibson1">C.A. Gibson, ''Interpreting a Classic,'' 1</ref><ref>K.A. Kapparis, ''Apollodoros against Neaira,'' 62</ref> The authorship of at least nine of the sixty-one orations is disputed.{{Ref_label|K|k|none}}

Fifty-six [[prologue]]s  and six letters are also extant. The prologues were openings of Demosthenes's speeches. They were collected for the Library of Alexandria by [[Callimachus]], who believed that Demosthenes composed them.<ref name="MacKie135">I. Worthington, ''Oral Performance'', 135</ref> Modern scholars are divided: some of them reject them,<ref name="Helios" /> while others, such as Blass, believe they are genuine.<ref name="Blass287">F.

The steward of his money fled to Rhodes, and was arrested by a Macedonian, Philoxenus. Philoxenus proceeded to examine the slave, "until he learned everything about such as had allowed themselves to accept a bribe from Harpalus."

"Demosthenes, however, he never mentioned at all, although Alexander held him in bitter hatred, and he himself had a private quarrel with him."<ref name="Pausanias" /> On the other hand, Plutarch believes that Harpalus sent Demosthenes a cup with twenty talents and that "Demosthenes could not resist the temptation, but admitting the present, ... he surrendered himself up to the interest of Harpalus."<ref name="Pl25" />
