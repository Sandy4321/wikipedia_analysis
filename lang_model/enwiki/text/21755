'''''The Ascension''''' is the second studio album by American [[no wave]] musician [[Glenn Branca]], released in 1981 by [[99 Records]]. The album experiments with resonances generated by [[alternate tunings]] for multiple electric guitars. It sold 10,000 copies and received acclaim from music critics.

==Background==
Branca wanted to explore the resonances generated when guitar strings tuned to the same note were played at high volumes. He assembled the Ascension Band with four electric guitarists, one bassist, and one drummer. The group included guitarist [[Lee Ranaldo]], who later joined [[alternative rock]] band [[Sonic Youth]].<ref>{{cite journal |last=Foege |first=Alec |authorlink=Alec Foege |date=April 9, 1995 |title=Maestro of the Off-Key Guitars |url=http://www.nytimes.com/1995/04/09/arts/pop-music-maestro-of-the-off-key-guitars.html?pagewanted=all |journal=[[The New York Times]] |at=sec. 2, p. 34 |access-date=February 9, 2015}}</ref> The group's bass player knew the owner and engineers at [[Avatar Studios|The Power Station]], so they were able to use it at little cost. They recorded five pieces in between tours for Branca's debut EP ''[[Lesson No. 1]]''.<ref name="masters-129">Masters 2007, p. 129</ref> "The Spectacular Commodity" was written before the songs on ''Lesson No. 1'', originating as a dance piece for Branca's band the Static.<ref name="masters-129"/><ref>Duckworth 1995, p. 431</ref>

The album's title was chosen as a continuation of works by [[Olivier Messiaen]] and [[John Coltrane]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://thequietus.com/articles/12056-glenn-branca-interview |title=Rorschach Audio: Glenn Branca Discusses Reading, Writing & Volume |last=Barry |first=Robert |date=April 24, 2013 |website=[[The Quietus]] |access-date=February 8, 2015}}</ref> Its iconic black-and-white cover artwork is by painter [[Robert Longo]].

Opening track "Lesson No. 2" starts with a bass riff.<ref name="tmt-mahoney">{{cite web |url=http://www.tinymixtapes.com/delorean/glenn-branca-ascension |title=1981: Glenn Branca - The Ascension |last=Mahoney |first=Brendan |date=February 5, 2009 |publisher=[[Tiny Mix Tapes]] |access-date=February 8, 2015}}</ref> It builds with [[tom-tom drum]]s and four guitars, amplified with buzzing feedback.<ref name="tmt-mahoney"/><ref name="pitchfork-beta">{{cite web |url=http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/909-the-ascension/ |title=Glenn Branca: The Ascension |last=Beta |first=Andy |date=June 19, 2003 |publisher=[[Pitchfork Media]] |access-date=February 8, 2015}}</ref> It devolves into a drumbeat with dissonant blasts of guitar. "The Spectacular Commodity" takes its name from [[situationist]] theory. The song moves through various tempos with three guitars playing in different octaves, bass, and drums. The climax occurs nine minutes into the track, as one guitar plays high [[open chord]]s and the other two act as accompaniment. "Structure" is built around repeated [[harmonic]]s.<ref name="tmt-mahoney"/>

"Light Fields (In Consonance)" begins by constructing rhythms out of one-note patterns. Toward its conclusion, the figures begin ascending into octave scales. The title track uses the [[overtone]]s from excessive guitar feedback.<ref name="tmt-mahoney"/> They form a dense, chaotic soundscape that continually rises.<ref name="masters-129"/>
