'''''Songs for Dustmites''''' is the debut album by [[United States|American]] musician and former ''[[Blue's Clues]]'' host [[Steve Burns]]. It was released in 12 August [[2003 in music|2003]] by [[Play It Again Sam Records|PIAS America]] and [[Columbia Records]]. The album was produced by [[Dave Fridmann]], member of [[alternative rock]] band [[Mercury Rev]] and the producer of most of the albums by [[The Flaming Lips]]; and [[Ed Buller]]. 

After quitting ''Blue's Clues'', Burns, "in a position where [he] could do what [he] wanted", decided to collaborate with Fridmann and other members of The Flaming Lips. After receiving multiple offers from various record labels, Burns chose PIAS America. ''Songs for Dustmites'' is a [[pop/rock]] or [[indie rock]] album, and its lyrics are mostly about "science and love". It received positive reviews from music critics, although some of them believed that the album was only good because of his collaborations.

==Background and recording==
Before acting in ''[[Blue's Clues]]'', Burns had been in many high-school and college bands. When he left the show in 2002 after working there for half a dozen years, he "found [himself] in a position where [he] could do what [he] wanted", he decided to become a musician.<ref name="morning" /> He worked on [[demo (music)|demo]]s, rehearsing the songs over and over again, scared to show them to anyone.<ref name="morning" /> Burns began recording the album once he got a computer that could record and edit sounds. He recorded it in a [[trial-and-error]] way, until he believed it sounded right.<ref name="mtv">{{Cite web |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1453666/ex-blues-clues-host-turns-music.jhtml |title=Ex-'Blue's Clues' Host Steve Burns An Indie Rocker At Heart |author=Joe D'Angelo |date=30 April 2002 |publisher=[[MTV]] |accessdate=15 June 2012}}</ref> Burns started making ''Songs for Dustmites'' after he "was obsessed with a picture someone had shown [him] of a dustmite fighting with a [[micro gear]]".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://steveswebpage.com/Press.html#workship |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20050204181121/http://steveswebpage.com/Press.html#workship |archivedate=4 February 2005 |accessdate=19 June 2012 |title=IndieWorkship.com |publisher=Steveswebpage.com, IndieWorkship.com}}</ref>

Burns later sent producer Dave Fridmann an e-mail introducing himself and sent the demos the day after Fridmann's son had a ''Blue's Clues''-themed birthday party.<ref name="cmj" /> Fridmann liked the demos, so he sent Burns to Tarbox Road Studios in [[Fredonia, New York]], where they worked with [[The Flaming Lips]] member [[Steven Drozd]].<ref name="morning" /> Mac Randall of ''[[The New York Observer]]'' hypothesized that the band decided to work with Burns because it was "too off-the-wall to resist."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://observer.com/2003/08/burns-sans-blue-hes-got-a-clue-fall-for-east-river-pipe-buckley/ |title=Burns Sans Blue: He's Got a Clue! Fall for East River Pipe, Buckley |author=Mac Randall |date=25 August 2003 |work=[[The New York Observer]] |accessdate=19 June 2012}}</ref> Burns stated of recording with members of the Flaming Lips that "There were definitely moments when I would run into the next room so I could giggle maniacally, jump up and down and clap my hands", calling the experience "a dream come true".<ref>{{cite web |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20050204181121/http://steveswebpage.com/Press.html#ew |url=http://steveswebpage.com/Press.html#ew |title=Steve Burns <U+2013> Blue's Clues Host Turned Rock Star |publisher=Steveswebpage.com |work=[[Entertainment Weekly]] |archivedate=18 June 2012 |accessdate=4 February 2005}}</ref> According to Burns, "he and Fridmann gave [him] a lot of help in understanding the studio process, how it all works, how to take a musical idea and shine it up into a song". Ed Buller wrote to Burns, "sort of in disbelief". Burns suspects that Buller searched the Internet for Burns and downloaded his songs, "expecting to make fun of [him]", and was surprised that the music was not bad. Burns also met and worked with Mike Rubin from Murmur Music, saying that "some of the best work on the album came out of that relationship".<ref name="morning">{{cite web |url=http://www.themorningnews.org/article/75000000-toddlers-cant-be-wrong |title=75,000,000 Toddlers Can't Be Wrong |author=Paul Ford |publisher=[[The Morning News (online magazine)|The Morning News]] |date=17 March 2003 |accessdate=1 December 2011}}</ref> Burns received numerous offers from various [[record label]]s mostly due to him making an album being a "ridiculous story". He chose to sign with [[PIAS Records]] after talking with Kevin Wortis of the label, saying he "was the first one who sat me down and said, 'This makes sense. I don't know why, but there is a thread of logic between ''Blue's Clues'', the Flaming Lips and your record'."<ref name="cmj">{{cite web |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20050204181121/http://steveswebpage.com/Press.html#cmj |url=http://steveswebpage.com/Press.html#cmj |title=CMJ New Music Report |author=Gerry Hart |accessdate=4 February 2005 |archivedate=19 June 2012 |publisher=Steveswebpage.com |work=[[CMJ]]}}</ref>

==Composition==
Lyrically, ''Songs for Dustmites'' deals with "familiar themes of love and loss",<ref name="p4k" /> while Burns himself has described the album as "songs about science and love".<ref name="morning" /> Musically, the album fits into the [[pop/rock]] and [[alternative rock]] genres, and is heavily influenced by the Flaming Lips.<ref name="amg" /><ref name="p4k" /><ref name="popmatters" /> The lyrics of the opening track "Mighty Little Man" have been interpreted in different ways: a television watcher who suddenly turns into "an everyday superhero",<ref name="amg" /><ref name="p4k" /> or "a lonely inventor's eureka moment".<ref>{{cite web |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20050204181121/http://steveswebpage.com/Press.html#newsweek |url=http://steveswebpage.com/Press.html#newsweek |author=Devin Gordon |title=Do You Know This Man? Need A Clue? |publisher=Steveswebpage.com |work=[[Newsweek]] |archivedate=18 June 2012 |accessdate=4 February 2005}}</ref> It was inspired by inventor [[Thomas Edison]] and his "DIY projects that changed human history". When he made the song, he wanted it to "write a positive, empowering, exclamation point of a song".<ref>{{Cite web |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20050204181121/http://steveswebpage.com/Press.html |url=http://steveswebpage.com/Press.html#spin |title=Me and You and a Dog Named Blue |author=Chris Norris |work=[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]] |publisher=Steveswebpage.com |archivedate=18 June 2012 |accessdate=4 February 2005}}</ref> The song itself contains a "fury of noise".<ref name="popmatters" /> The following track, "What I Do on Saturday", is a "playful" [[pop (music)|pop]] song, while "Maintain" is a more [[mainstream]] song influenced by American [[alternative (genre)|alternative]] band [[They Might Be Giants]].<ref name="amg" /><ref name="p4k" /> The song "Troposhere" is "bright and bouncy", sounding like the Flaming Lips song "[[Fight Test]]".<ref name="amg" /> The [[ballad (music)|ballad]]<ref name="popmatters" /> "A Song for Dustmites" contains piano and [[synthesizer|synth]]s. The next track, "Stick Around", is melancholic<ref name="amg" /> and sounds optimistic with its [[cello]] and [[trumpet]].<ref name="p4k" /> ">1" is a "simple"<ref name="popmatters" /> [[downtempo]] song that tells the story of a dysfunctional relationship. It features strings and a [[guitar solo]].<ref name="amg" /><ref name="p4k" />

''Songs for Dustmites'' received positive reviews from music critics; most of them were surprised that an album made by the former ''Blue's Clues'' host would be any good.<ref name="p4k" /><ref name="morning" /> Heather Phares of [[AllMusic]] called the album "a promising debut", writing it was "a good-natured collection of atmospheric pop that takes a few chances now and then." She gave the album three and a half stars out of five.<ref name="amg" /> [[Pitchfork Media]] gave it a 7.8/10 and complimented Burns' "lyrical insight and gift for writing and arranging endlessly listenable pop songs". The album as a whole was described as managing "to remain true to Burns' legacy as a nice-guy kid's show host despite having made an unabashedly adult record that deals with familiar themes of love and loss".<ref name="p4k" /> Brian Houston of [[PopMatters]] wrote that "''Songs for Dustmites'' is a successful album, but the caveat will always be that the reason for the success lies with the Lips contributions and not with Burns' talent or vision".<ref name="popmatters" /> A reviewer at [[Tiny Mix Tapes]] stated he had "hoped to rate it amongst the worst of the year in revenge for the long and dreadful years of ''Blue's Clues'' that he had bestowed upon me. But he has beaten the odds and has accomplished what he had hoped for in this record".<ref name="tmt" />
