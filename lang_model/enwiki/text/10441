The '''Siemens bribery scandal in Greece''' was a [[Political corruption|corruption]] and [[bribery]] [[scandal]] that hit [[Greece]] over deals between [[Siemens AG]] and Greek government officials during the [[2004 Summer Olympic Games]] in [[Athens]]<ref name="dw">[http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0,2144,2249977,00.html Report: Siemens Scandal May Involve Top Executives | Business | DW.DE | 27.11.2006<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> regarding security systems<ref name="telco">[http://www.telecomseurope.net/article.php?id_article=6250]{{Dead link |date=May 2013}}</ref> and purchases by [[OTE]] in the 1990s.<ref name="iht1jul08">[http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2008/07/01/europe/EU-Greece-Corruption-Siemens.php The New York Times - Breaking News, World News & Multimedia<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

Charges have, as of 27 August 2008, not been brought against any specific individual, as under Greek law charges can be filled against "any responsible person".<ref name="iht1jul08"/>

So far, no wrongdoing has been proved, either by Siemens, by Greek government officials, or anyone else.

Although there is no conclusive evidence, the scandal has created a serious change in the attitudes of the Greek public, most notably a dissatisfaction with both main [[political parties in Greece]], [[Nea Dimokratia]] and [[Panhellenic Socialist Movement]] (PASOK)ctions system and creating a "hole of authority" leading to a vicious circle of political instability, if the Greek people don't reach a new consensus over which major political parties best represent their ideals.

It has been claimed that the political outcome of the case may be analogous to that of [[Italy]] 15 years ago.<ref name="tr">[http://www.turkishdailynews.com.tr/article.php?enewsid=107953]{{Dead link |date=May 2013}}</ref>

It has been claimed that the bribes may have been up to 100 million Euro.<ref name="anews">[http://www.athensnews.gr/athweb/nathens.prnt_article?e=C&f=13273&t=03&m=A21&aa=1]{{Dead link |date=May 2013}}</ref>  These bribes were allegedly given in order to win state contracts.<ref name="dw"/><ref name="ekath">[http://www.ekathimerini.com/4dcgi/_w_articles_politics_1_31/01/2008_92788]{{Dead link |date=May 2013}}</ref>

It is that a few PASOK members acting as individuals may have been involved, although this is simply a claim and nothing has been proved or at least any evidence come to light.<ref name="gram">[http://www.greeknewsonline.com/modules.php?name=News&file=article&sid=8820]{{Dead link |date=May 2013}}</ref>

A Greek [[prosecutor]], after two years of investigations, filled charges on 1 July 2008 for [[money laundering]] and [[bribery]].<ref name="dw2">[http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0,2144,3455188,00.html Siemens Hit by Corruption Charges in Greece, Norway | Business | DW.DE | 02.07.2008<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

It has been claimed that it is certain Siemens divisions that were involved in the transactions.<ref name="cn">[http://english.peopledaily.com.cn/90001/90777/90853/6461400.html Former Siemens executive sentenced for bribery scandal - People's Daily Online<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

[[Tasos Mantelis]] who was Minister for Transport and Communications during the PASOK administration in 1998 admitted in May 2010 to a parliamentary investigation committee that the sum of 200,000 German marks was deposited in 1998 in a Swiss bank account from Siemens during his administration, allegedly for funding his election campaign. A further deposit of 250,000 German marks was made into the same bank account in 2000 which Mantelis claims is from an unknown source.<ref name="tn">[http://www.tanea.gr/default.asp?pid=2&ct=1&artid=4576575 <U+03A7><U+03BF><U+03C1><U+03B7><U+03B3><U+03CC><U+03C2> <U+03BC><U+03BF><U+03C5> <U+03B7>...
