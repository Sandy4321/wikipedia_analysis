'''''Orthodera novaezealandiae''''', known as the '''New Zealand Mantis''' or the '''New Zealand Praying Mantis''', is a [[species]] of [[praying mantis]] which is, as both the [[scientific name]] and [[common name]]s suggest, [[Indigenous (ecology)|indigenous]] and [[Endemism|endemic]] only to [[New Zealand]]<ref name="auk">[http://www.landcareresearch.co.nz/research/biocons/invertebrates/documents/postermantis.pdf] University of Aukland</ref><ref name="ram">Ramsay, G.

==Description==
''O. novaezealandiae'' [[nymph (biology)|nymphs]] are pale, translucent green with a dark stripe running head to end of [[abdomen]].  As adults, they are bright green and grow to between in 40 mm  35 mm in length. <ref name="pets"/>(see note <ref>[http://animaldiversity.ummz.umich.edu/site/accounts/information/Orthodera_novaezealandiae.html] This information from the [[University of Michigan]] reports that ''O. novaezealandiae'' grows between between 3.5 and  4.5 ''inches'' in length, a size that seems incompitable with the information given in other sources.  3.5 to 4.5 ''centimenters'' may be what the text should read.</ref>)  As in most mantis species, [[sexual dimorphism]] means the female is larger.<ref name="diversity"/><ref name="pets"/>

The New Zealand Mantis has a triangular head with slightly over-sized [[compound eye]]s that give it excellent [[binocular vision]] (although they do have a [[blind spot]]).  Its [[wing]]s differ from those of other species in the "development of the [[archedictyon]] and the absence of cross-[[vein]]s in the forewing".<ref name="diversity"/><ref name="pets"/>

"A very active little Mantis"<ref name="pets"/>, ''O. novaezealandiae'' is well-designed as a predator.  Its specialized forelimbs are long and equipped with extremely sharp spikes to impale prey.<ref name="diversity"/>  Blue [[eye spot]]s on the underside of the insect's forelegs helps in differentiating this species from ''[[Miomantis caffra]]'', an [[introduced species]] from [[South Africa]] that became established in New Zealand during the 1970s.<ref name="auk"/><ref name="tree"/><ref>[http://halfpie.net/article/125/] Photo of ''O. novaezealandiae'' female creating [[ootheca]] and discussion of ''[[Miomantis caffra]]''</ref>

==Ecology==

''O. novaezealandiae'' prefer open, [[shrub]]by terrain where its similarity to [[leaf]]y [[vegetation]] may be used as [[camouflage]] to [[ambush]] [[prey]].  It hides well from predators and is near or at the top of the [[invertebrate]] [[food chain]] in its [[habitat]].  As an [[endemic species]] of New Zealand that eats [[pest]]s and has a very large [[appetite]], ''O. novaezealandiae'' is a [[beneficial insect]] to those involved in [[agriculture]] and they are used in many [[garden]]s.<ref name="diversity"/><ref>[http://www.rimutakatrust.org.nz/faq/faq.htm] Rimutaka Forest Park, New Zealand</ref>

The New Zealand Mantis is vulnerable to the use of [[pesticide]]s, both directly and through the effects of a diminished food supply, and their [[ootheca]] are sometimes attacked by [[parasitic wasp]]s.<ref name="diversity"/><ref>[http://www.geocities.com/brisbane_hoppers/Mantids.htm] Praying Mantids in the Brisbane area, Queensland, Australia</ref>

The only two species of mantis in New Zealand are this [[native species]] and the previously-mentioned introduced species ''[[Miomantis caffra|M. caffra]]'' discovered as established in the [[Auckland]] [[suburb]] of [[New Lynn, New Zealand|New Lynn]] in 1978.  ''O. novaezealandiae'' is taxonomically very close to, and has sometimes been considered [[conspecific]] and synonymous with, the [[Australia]]n species ''[[Orthodera ministralis|O. ministralis]]''.<ref name="auk"/><ref name="ram"/>

==Cultivation==
The New Zealand Mantis is bred in captivity.<ref name="pets"/><ref name="data">[http://ttwebbase.dyndns.org/mantid/view/18.html] Species Database: Mantodea</ref>  Special care must be taken to prevent this small, quick-moving species from escaping.  Nymphs are especially fast and can leap relatively far as well.  It can be kept at room temperature (25&ndash;30 C) but does prefer warmth.  Their enclosure should be sprayed with water a few times a week, and when they are young their enclosure should be kept at around 50&ndash;60% humidity.  Captive ''O. novaezealandiae'' can be fed on a diet of small [[cricket]]s and [[flies]].<ref name="pets"/>
