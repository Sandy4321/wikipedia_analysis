The '''Glenn & Viola Walters Cultural Arts Center''' is a multi-use [[art center|arts]] and [[Performing arts center|performance venue]] in downtown [[Hillsboro, Oregon]], United States. Opened in 2004, it is housed in a red-colored stone building completed in 1949 as a [[Lutheranism|Lutheran church]]. Hillsboro, a city on the west side of [[Portland, Oregon|Portland]], owns the three-level facility and operates it through their Parks and Recreation Department.

Walters Cultural Arts Center includes [[Art gallery|gallery]] space, classroom space, and a 200 seat performance hall. With two above ground floors and one below ground level, the center has a total of {{convert|15664|ft2|m2}} of space. Located on East Main Street, the [[Washington County Courthouse (Oregon)|Washington County Courthouse]] and the [[Hillsboro Civic Center]] are just to the west and the [[Edward Schulmerich House]] one block to the east on Main. The center is named in honor of a local couple who donated $1 million towards the project which included purchasing the property and USD$2.4 million worth of renovations.
