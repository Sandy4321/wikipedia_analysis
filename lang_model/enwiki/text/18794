Manufactuing is outsourced to the Chinese-based Laf<U+00E8> Peripherals International. Tandberg Storage also owns 93.5% of '''O-Mass AS'''.

==History==
Tandberg Storage was established as a [[demerger|spinn-off]] of Tandberg Data on 22 May 2003. Trandberg Storage had previously been an integrated part of Trandberg Data, but management wanted to two companies to follow separate [[research and development]] strategies. While Trandberg Data retain responsibility on complete storage and automation systems, Tandberg Storage would focus on advanced tape-drive technologies. Tandberg Storage was established with 37 research and development employees, plus a 93.5% ownership of O-Mass.<ref name=history>{{cite web |url=http://www.tandbergstorage.com/Company/History.aspx |title=History |author=Tandberg Storage |accessdate=25 April 2009}}</ref> The company was listed on the [[Oslo Stock Exchange]] on 2 October 2003, with the owners of Tandberg Data receiving all the shares in Tandberg Storage.<ref name=listing />

The initial goal of the company was to develop a [[Linear Tape-Open#LTO-2|LTO-2]] linear tape-open drive withing a half-height form factor. While the underlaying technology had been developed, the main components needed to be developed, in particular the drive mechanism. A working system was demonstrated in December 2003, and in June 2004 the first complete prototype could be tested. In October, the test program started, and from December verification was initiated with the LTO Commuttee. The drive was approved on 11 March 2005. In the second half of 2005, Tandberg Storage developed [[Serial Attached SCSI]] and [[application and data integration]]. These were both launched in 2006. In 2005, the company also started development of a half-height [[Linear Tape-Open#LTO-3|LTO-3]] drive. The product was launched in 2007. The following year, a no-encryption [[Linear Tape-Open#LTO-4|LTO-4]] was launched.<ref name=history />

In Novmeber 2008, the Tandberg Storage merged with Tandberg Data, with the latter paying the formers' owners in shares. Both companies companies had been having financial problems, and the cooperation between the two had been difficult during 2008. Tandberg Storage was at the time the largest supplier to Tandberg Data. By merging, the managements hoped to gain synergy effects between the two companies. Until the announcement of the merger in September, Tandberg Storage's share price had fallen 89% since the start of the year. Following the annoucement, the share price fell a further 35%. The take-over involved a refinancing of the debt in Tandberg Storage. Tandberg Storage remained a subsidiary.<ref name=merger />
