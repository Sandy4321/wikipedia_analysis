{{otherships|RMS Empress of Australia}}
'''RMS ''Empress of Australia''''' was an [[ocean liner]] built in 1913-1919 by [[Stettiner Vulcan AG|Vulcan AG shipyard]] in [[Szczecin|Stettin]] (now Szczecin, [[Poland]]) for the [[Hamburg America Line]].<ref name="haworth1145300">Haworth, R.B.

In trans-Pacific service, the ship garnered fame for her part in rescue efforts at Tokyo following the [[1923 Great Kanto Earthquake|Great Kanto earthquake]] of 1923.<ref name="nyt1952">[http://select.nytimes.com/mem/archive/pdf?res=FA0615FA385F177B93C3A9178ED85F468585F9   40-year-old Ship Makes Last Trip; ''Empress of Australia'', Luxury Liner and Troop Carrier, on Way to Scrap Heap,"] ''New York Times.''  1 May 1952.</ref> 

In trans-Atlantic service, she earned distinction in 1927 by bringing the [[Edward VIII of the United Kingdom|Prince of Wales]] from England to the [[Diamond Jubilee]] celebrations in [[Canada]].  She was honored to serve as Royal Yacht during the [[Royal tours of Canada#20th & 21st Centuries|Royal tour of Canada]] in 1939.<ref name="nyt1952"/>

==Service history==
The ship was originally built for the [[Hamburg America Line]] by [[Stettiner Vulcan AG|Vulcan AG shipyard]], [[Stettin]], [[German Empire|Germany]] (now [[Szczecin]], [[Poland]]), in 1912, as yard number 333.<ref name="haworth1145300"/>

===Pre-Canadian Pacific ownership===
[[Image:RMS Admiral Von Tirpitz.jpg|thumb|left|300px|The ''Tirpitz'' during fitting out at the Vulkan shipyards of Stettin.]]
The partially completed hull was launched on 20 December 1913. During this period, it was the intention of the Hamburg America Line to name the completed ship the SS ''Admiral von Tirpitz'' in honour of [[Alfred von Tirpitz]].  Later, the prospective name of the ship was shortened to simply the SS ''Tirpitz'',  but final outfitting was held up during [[World War I]].

In 1916, Kaiser [[Wilhelm II]] ordered her to be completed as his [[royal yacht]], in which he envisioned receiving the allied naval fleets when they surrendered.  Her first trip, however, was under seizure as a war prize when she sailed from [[Hamburg]] to [[Kingston upon Hull|Hull]] on 1 December 1919. She was then used as a troop ship under [[Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company|P & O Line]] management.

===Canadian Pacific ownership===
''Tirpitz'' was one of two German-built vessels purchased by Canadian Pacific Railway in 1921 which were both confusingly re-named [[RMS Empress of China|RMS ''Empress of China'']];<ref name="wef1">White Empress fleet: [http://www.angelfire.com/pe2/pjs1/eos22.html  20 ships, descriptions]</ref>  the first vessel {{ship|SS|Prinz Friedrich Wilhelm}} having briefly carried the name ''Empress of China'' before being renamed RMS ''Empress of India'' in advance of CPR's acquisition of the ''Tirpitz''.

[[Image:Ship Plan Australia.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Technical drawings of the SS ''Empress of Australia'']]

Thus ''Tirpitz'' became the third CPR vessel to carry the name ''Empress of China'', however this honour would only last a matter of months.<ref name="wef1"/>  She was refitted by [[John Brown & Company]], [[Clydebank]], and renamed by CPR yet again to become RMS ''Empress of Australia'' in August 1921. By 1922 she sailed from [[Greenock]] to the Pacific via the [[Panama Canal]].

After 20 voyages across the [[Pacific]], Canadian Pacific were forced to deal with her poor performance and chose to re-engine and re-boiler the ship.  She sailed to Govan Fairfield at [[Glasgow]], arriving 9 September 1926. The vastly complex work was made more difficult by her divided uptakes, offering no central space to remove machinery. Old boilers were sliced up and removed in pieces, the whole job lasting many months and cost over half a million pounds.

When completed she was virtually a new ship, now driven by [[Steam turbine|Parsons turbines]] with six double-ended boilers. On trials the ship made {{convert|20.34|kn|km/h}} and required 50 tons a day less oil. Three classes of passenger accommodations were incorporated in the final layout; in total, 1,500 passengers could be carried in luxurious interior appointments, the ship having been fitted out to a very high specification. The dining room was in the [[R<U+00E9>gence|French Regency]] style. There was a spacious Lounge designed in the [[Empire (style)|Empire style]], which included a dance floor. The writing room was fitted in the style of [[Louis XVI of France|Louis XVI]], with tinted walls and mahogany furniture, as was the smoke room which had oak panelled walls. There was also a [[swimming pool]] and fully equipped gymnasium.

===From near disaster to great distinction===
On Saturday, 1 September 1923, at 11:55 am, the ''Empress of Australia'' was making ready to depart from the docks at [[Yokohama]], [[Japan]]. Several hundred people were on the docks, catching streamers and confetti from the passengers lining the rails, and waving their farewells. Tugs were about to ease the ship away from the dock when, without warning the 23,000 ton liner was flung violently from side to side. The earth trembled under several violent shocks and sections of the dock collapsed under the feet of the panic stricken crowds. The land and remaining dock structure began to roll in wave like motions as high as six to eight feet. In minutes the worst shocks were over, but after-shocks, some quite heavy, continued for some time, while winds rose to {{convert|70|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}}. From the city a heavy rumbling sound could be heard as hundreds of buildings collapsed into rubble. This was the 1923 [[Great Kant<U+014D> earthquake]], devastating Tokyo and Yokohama and the entire [[Kant<U+014D> region]] of central [[Honsh<U+016B>]].  This was one of the worst earthquake disasters in recorded history.

The ''Empress of Australia'' was in a very dangerous position. Crowded with passengers, she was still alongside the remains of the dock, with a freighter moored close behind so she could not clear without the aid of tugs. Meantime, the ''Lyons Maru'', moored to the east, had lost her cable and drifted across the harbor, colliding with the ''Empress'' at her stern. She then hit amidships, shattering a lighter loaded with lumber that had drifted alongside. This small vessel acted as a buffer between the two large ships and prevented serious damage. Tugs had disappeared in the confusion and fires were started on the docks and were spreading rapidly. Available crew and passengers were put to work hosing down the ship to put out sparks and embers that were falling on the decks. Ropes and ladders were lowered over the side so that people trapped on the dock could climb aboard. Captain Robinson then tried to push the freighter moored astern with his ship, to allow enough room to maneuver away from the flaming docks. The ''Empress'' was able to carefully move the nearby freighter, the ''Steel Navigator''; and then the ''Empress'' slowly pulled away.
[[Image:Empress of Australia in Yokohama in 1923.jpg|thumb|right|200px|RMS ''Empress of Australia'' after the earthquake.]]

When the ''Empress of Australia'' moved forward, her port propeller fouled in the anchor cable of the freighter. Fortunately the liner was now about {{convert|60|ft|m}} away from the flames, and the winds had shifted, blowing the fires away from the ship.  By 3pm the fires had died down and the wind dropped off to a light breeze; the ship was immobile but safe for the moment. In the distance vast fires could be seen in the city. The ship's lifeboats were lowered and manned by members of the crew and passenger volunteers, who formed rescue parties to help those ashore, working through the night.

The next morning, the ship was again in danger from a large mass of burning oil that was moving across the harbor. The ''Empress'' could not steer because of the damaged propeller, but was able to avoid the oil fire long enough to get assistance from the tanker ''Iris''. Her captain agreed to tow the bow of the ''Empress of Australia'' around, and she was then able to move out to sea and a safer anchorage. When taking a count on Sunday, there were over 2000 refugees on board.

On Monday, the RMS ''Empress of Canada'' arrived on her regular schedule; and she was able to provide the ''Empress of Australia'' with more stores.  Then the ''Empress of Canada'' transported a large number of refugees on to [[Kobe]], where the Japanese government had set up a relief center.

On September 4th, the Imperial Japanese Navy's second ''Fus<U+014D>''-class battleship ''[[Japanese battleship Yamashiro|Yamashiro]]'' arrived at the harbor. The ''Empress of Australia'' had been unable to proceed due to the fact that she had a fouled propeller. Arrangements were made for a diver from the ''Yamashiro'' to inspect the damage and effect repairs. The cable was unwound and the machinery was tested; and the fouled propeller was found to have suffered no damage.

The ''Empress of Australia'' was now free to leave, but at the request of the British Consul, she remained as long as needed for continued relief work. Each morning, for the next several days, the ''Empress of Australia'' re-entered the devastated harbor and sent her boats ashore manned by a combination of crew, local residents, and passenger volunteers. Refugees were brought aboard, transferred from the ship to other vessels, or taken to Kobe. To aid the victims, the ships officers and most of the passengers donated everything they could spare. She finally departed Yokohama on 12 September 1923, returning to her routine duties; but her services were not forgotten. Captain Robinson received numerous awards in recognition of his actions, including the [[Order of the British Empire|CBE]], and award of the Lloyds Silver Medal.

A group of passengers and refugees who were aboard during the disaster commissioned a bronze tablet and presented it to the ship in recognition of the relief efforts. When the ''Empress of Australia'' was scrapped in 1952, the bronze tablet was rescued and presented to Captain Robinson, then aged 82, in a special ceremony in [[Vancouver]].

===Atlantic crossing and royal patronage===
[[Image:SS & RMS Empress of Australia.jpg|thumb|left|220px|The ''Empress of Australia'' in her prime.]]
On 12 September 1923, the ''Empress of Australia'' returned to her routine duties. In August, three years later, the ''Empress of Australia'' departed from [[Hong Kong]], after her twenty first and final [[Pacific]] voyage.

Canadian Pacific decided to transfer the ''Empress of Australia'' to Atlantic service.  She sailed from [[Southampton]] for [[Quebec City]] on her first voyage on 25 June 1927, with the [[Edward VIII of the United Kingdom|Prince of Wales]] and [[George VI of the United Kingdom|Prince George, the Duke of York]].  The Royal princes and Prime Minister [[Stanley Baldwin]] were  bound for [[Diamond Jubilee]] celebrations in [[Canada]].<ref>[http://select.nytimes.com/mem/archive/pdf?res=F30B11FB3A5D17738DDDA90B94DF405B878EF1D3  "Princes on Ship Reach Quebec; The Empress of Australia Anchors at Ancient City After Midnight. City is Gay with Flags; Visitors From All Parts of the Dominion and America Have Flocked There,"] ''New York Times.'' 30 July 1927.</ref>  In this new Atlantic route, she was teamed with two other ships -- the ''[[Empress of Scotland]]'' (originally the [[SS Kaiserin Auguste Victoria|SS ''Kaiserin Auguste Victoria'']]) and the ''Empress of France''.

In 1928, the ''Empress of Australia'' began to cruise in the off season and to sail on round the world voyages.

After the ''Empress of France'' was withdrawn from the service, the ''Empress of Australia'' and the ''Empress of Scotland'' carried on a two-ship service with white hulls with dark blue ribbon and green boot topping.

In 1938, she went to [[Harland & Wolff]] at Southampton for an overhaul, returning for the 1939 season.

After three Atlantic crossings she was chosen to act as the [[Royal Yacht|royal yacht]] for King [[George VI of the United Kingdom|George VI]] and the Queen [[Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon|Elizabeth]] for their [[Royal tours of Canada#20th & 21st Centuries|Royal tour of Canada]].<ref name="nyt1952"/>  In 1939, [[HMY]] ''Empress of Australia'', sailed from [[Portsmouth]] 6 May 1939 and arriving in Quebec on 17 May 1939, two days late due to dense [[fog]] on the Atlantic.

She continued on the Quebec run until the outbreak of [[World War II]]; and the ''Empress of Australia'' was modified to play her part in the war effort.

===Second World War service===
The ''Empress of Australia'' was sent to Southampton, where she was to be converted into a troopship; painted in grey, fitted with a three-inch (76 mm) gun and with a carrying capacity of 5,000. It was in this role that she would remain for the next 13 years. The ''Empress of Australia'' left on her first wartime voyage to [[Ceylon]] and [[Bombay]] on 28 September 1939. Following this task, the ship then went across the [[Atlantic]] to [[City of Halifax|Halifax]], from where she joined a large convoy carrying Canadian soldiers to the battlefields of Europe.

During the entire war, the ''Empress of Australia'' enjoyed very good luck.  In 1941, it was widely reported that she'd been torpedoed off the coast of Africa, but she survived that brush with disaster.<ref>[http://select.nytimes.com/mem/archive/pdf?res=FB0B1EF73D5E167B93CAAB178AD85F458485F9  "''Empress of Australia'' Torpedoed; Liner Is 'Down by Bow' Off Africa; British Liner which was Torpedoed off Dakar,"] ''New York Times.'' 28 January 1941.</ref>  She was only seriously damaged once, when she was holed by the Orient Line's 14,982 ton ''Ormonde'' during the North Africa campaign in January 1943. Her final wartime voyage was from [[Hong Kong]] with ex-[[Prisoner of war|prisoners of war]] and internees.

===Post-war service===
After World War II the ''Empress of Australia'' worked world wide as a troop ship in every theater of war, including carrying military personnel to Pusan during the [[Korean War]].

In 1946 while anchoring off Liverpool her anchor tangled with that of a [[cargo liner]] ''Debrett''; the two ships collided and seven tugs were needed to separate them. In December of that year, she was re-fitted for peace-time trooping, offering more comfortable accommodations for the troops; however she was never repainted and remained in the wartime grey color scheme. She continued to carry troops up to another overhaul in [[Liverpool]] in 1951. The following year -- after her 70th trooping voyage -- she was sold.

She sailed from the [[Mersey]] to [[Inverkeithing]], 8 May 1952, where the long-serving vessel was scrapped.<ref name="nyt1952"/> Her fine oak carved panelling and ship's furniture are now installed in the splendid Ships Room in the Visitor Centre of Glenfarclas Distillery at Ballindalloch on Speyside.
