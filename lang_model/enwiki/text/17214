==National Park==

Originally the site of Gray's Quarry, a gravel and sand pit, Indigo Lake came under the responsibilities of the park service on December 27 1974, with the creation of the Cuyahoga Valley National Recreation Area.<ref>[http://www.nps.gov/cuva/historyculture/upload/History7-final-for-web.pdf History of the Park], retrieved 30/09/2012</ref> The pit was later filled with water by park service personnel to create what would now be called "Indigo Lake". It is situated entirely within the boundaries of [[Cuyahoga Valley National Park]].<ref name=NP>[http://www.nps.gov/cuva/index.htm Cuyahoga Valley National Park], retrieved 30/09/2012, published by the [[USNPS]]</ref> It is one of only two places in the park closed to swimming.<ref>[http://www.nps.gov/cuva/planyourvisit/daily-closures.htm Park Closures], retrieved 30/09/2012, published by the [[USNPS]]</ref> Although protected as part of the national park, the lake is a popular spot for local fishing.<ref name=go/> In addition, the lake (which normally freezes over each winter) is used by the Akron Fire Department to practise under-ice rescue techniques each winter.<ref name=ice>{{cite web|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-158748570.html|title=Dive team practices rescues in frozen lake: Cold weather gives Akron firefighters the needed ice for annual training.|retrieved=5/10/12|publisher=Akron Beacon Journal}}</ref>
