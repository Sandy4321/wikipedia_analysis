'''Harold Francis Davidson''' (14 July 1875&nbsp;<U+2013> 30 July 1937), generally known as the '''Rector of Stiffkey''', was a [[Church of England]] priest who, after a notorious court case in 1932, was  convicted on charges of immorality and [[defrocked]] by the Church. Davidson strongly protested his innocence, and to raise funds for his reinstatement campaign he exhibited himself in a barrel on the [[Blackpool]] seafront. He performed in other sideshows of a similar nature and died after being attacked by a lion in whose cage he was appearing in a seaside show.

Before his ordination in 1903, Davidson had  a brief career on the London stage as an entertainer. As a young [[curate]] he became actively involved with charitable work among London's poor, an interest he maintained following his appointment in 1906 as [[Rector (ecclesiastical)|rector]] of the rural [[Norfolk]] parish of [[Stiffkey]]. After the [[First World War]], in which he served as a naval chaplain, he devoted himself almost exclusively to his London work. Styling himself the "Prostitute's Padre", his declared mission was the rescue of young girls he considered in danger of falling into vice. In this role he approached and befriended hundreds of girls, and although there was little direct evidence of improper behaviour, Davidson was frequently found in compromising situations. His neglect of his parish and family strained relations in Stiffkey; after a formal complaint, the [[Bishop of Norwich]] instituted disciplinary proceedings. Davidson's defence was severely compromised by his own eccentric conduct and was damaged beyond repair when the prosecution produced a photograph of Davidson with a near-naked teenage girl.

After his defrocking, Davidson's later career as a showman earned him much notoriety but little money.  His attempts at legal redress were unsuccessful, despite recognition even in church circles that he had not been fairly treated in the court hearing that had condemned him. The case continued to attract public interest decades after his death, with fictional and stage representations. His descendants have continued to assert his innocence of any wrongdoing, and later commentators have generally accepted that however unwise and inappropriate his behaviour, his basic motives were genuine and that he did not deserve the humiliations he endured.

==Family background and childhood==
[[File:St Mary, Sholing - geograph.org.uk - 1514022.jpg|left|thumb|St Mary's Church, Sholing]]
Harold Davidson was born on 14 July 1875 at [[Sholing]], near the south coast port of [[Southampton]], to the Reverend Francis Davidson and his wife Alice.<ref>Tucker, p. xiii</ref><ref>Cullen, p. 26</ref> Francis Davidson was the vicar of St Mary's, Sholing, a post he had held since 1866; as many as 27 members of the Davidson family were or had been [[Anglican]] clergy. Alice Davidson, n<U+00E9>e Hodgskin, was a great-niece of the educationist and [[Rugby School]] headmaster [[Thomas Arnold]].<ref name= T1>Tucker, pp. 1<U+2013>2</ref> Sholing was a poor parish, with a mixed population of dock labourers and itinerant workers  many of whom  had little interest in churchgoing.  Francis Davidson, described by Harold Davidson's biographer, Tom Cullen, as "a tiny man&nbsp;... with a luxuriant beard that gave him the appearance of a gnome",<ref name= C1>Cullen, p. 27</ref> served this parish  for 48 years.<ref name= T1/> Although he could be pugnacious when necessary, according to a former parishioner he was a true pastor,  willing to offer help whatever the circumstances.<ref name= C1/>

Davidson's family assumed that he would follow his father in becoming a priest and he was brought up strictly.<ref name= C1/> When he was six he began attending Banister Court School in Southampton, an establishment founded initially for the sons of [[Merchant Navy]] officers.<ref name= T1/> In 1890 Harold was sent to live with two maiden aunts in [[Croydon]] while he attended the [[Whitgift School]].<ref name= C2>Cullen, pp. 28<U+2013>30</ref>  Here, he became an enthusiastic amateur actor, encouraged by his friendship with a fellow-pupil, [[Leon Quartermaine]], who later won recognition on the stage and in films. In February 1894 the pair appeared together in a school production of the farce ''Sent to the Tower''.<ref name= C2/> Under his aunts' influence, Harold became a part-time worker at [[Toynbee Hall]], an East End charity founded by [[Samuel Augustus Barnett|Samuel]] and [[Henrietta Barnett]] that attracted many volunteers from schools and universities. Because of these distractions he neglected his school work and failed to win a scholarship that would enable him to attend [[Oxford University]] and study for [[holy orders]].  In the face of his father's disapproval, he decided to pursue a career as a stage comedian.<ref name= T1/>

==Theatre, Oxford and ordination==
Davidson's principal theatrical genre was that of the "drawing-room entertainer"; Cullen describes this kind of performance as "[a]n answer to the demand of a rising middle class which was neither cultured nor resourceful, but which wanted desperately to be diverted".<ref name= C3>Cullen, pp. 30<U+2013>31</ref> Within a few months of leaving Whitgift in 1894, Davidson appeared on the London stage, at [[Steinway Hall#London|Steinway Hall]] in  Lower Seymour Street, performing a comic routine.<ref name= T1/> He was reasonably successful and in the next few years found provincial engagements  with  Masonic lodges, literary societies and similar social organisations. Cullen suggests that his greatest triumph was as a comic actor in a touring production of [[Brandon Thomas]]'s popular farce ''[[Charley's Aunt]]''. Davidson played the part of Lord Fancourt Babberley, who masquerades as the rich aunt of a fellow-Oxford undergraduate<U+2014>a frenetic role for which Cullen believes Davidson was eminently suitable.<ref name= C3/>

[[File:Exeter College Quad.jpg|thumb|Exeter College, Oxford]]
During his theatrical days, Davidson maintained high standards of personal morality, observed strict [[teetotalism]] and gave regular Bible readings to the elderly in the towns in which he performed on tour.<ref name= C3/> He later gave an account of an incident from November 1894 when he was performing in London. While walking along the [[Thames Embankment]] in a thick fog, he encountered a 16-year-old girl who was about to throw herself into the [[River Thames|Thames]]. After preventing her suicide attempt, Davidson learned that she had run away from home near [[Cambridge]],  was  penniless and without shelter. He sent her home, with a letter for her mother: "Her pitiful story made a tremendous impression on me&nbsp;... I have ever since&nbsp;... kept my eyes open for opportunities to help that kind of girl."<ref>Tucker, p. 3</ref>

In 1898 Davidson finally bowed to his father's wish that he should study for holy orders, after the intervention of the Reverend [[Basil Wilberforce]], grandson of the abolitionist [[William Wilberforce]] and a friend of the Davidson family. Wilberforce was an alumnus of [[Exeter College, Oxford]], and used his influence to secure Davidson a place there despite the latter's lack of qualifications.<ref>Cullen, p. 33</ref><ref name= ODNB>{{cite web|last= Brown|first= Robert|title= Davidson, Harold Francis (1875<U+2013>1937)|url= http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/51099|publisher= Oxford Dictionary of National Biography Online edition|accessdate= 28 May 2013}} {{subscription}}</ref>  At Oxford, Davidson's behaviour was notably eccentric; he displayed considerable energy but disregarded rules, was persistently unpunctual and regularly failed his examinations.<ref name= T2>Tucker, pp. 4<U+2013>5</ref>  He continued to appear on the stage when he could, and decorated the walls of his rooms with autographed pictures of actresses. By 1901 his academic inadequacies were such that he was required to leave Exeter College, although he was allowed to continue studying for his degree at Grindle's Hall, a [[Cram school|cramming establishment]]. He finally passed his examinations in 1903, at the age of 28, and that year was ordained by the [[Francis Paget|Bishop of Oxford]]<U+2014>after some reluctance on the part of the bishop to accept so unpromising a candidate.<ref name= C4>Cullen, pp. 34<U+2013>35</ref>

In 1901, when [[Annie Horniman]]'s travelling theatrical company visited Oxford, Davidson fell in love with one of the company's leading actresses, Moyra ("Molly") Cassandra Saurin, an attractive blonde and blue-eyed woman from [[County Meath]] in Ireland. The couple were quickly engaged, but the relationship was stormy and was several times broken off.<ref name= T2/> There was no question of marriage until Davidson was fully established in his new profession. His first church appointment was a curacy at Holy Trinity Church, [[Windsor, Berkshire]], with an additional role as assistant chaplain to the [[Household Cavalry]] at [[Combermere Barracks]].<ref name= ODNB/> In 1905 he was transferred to London as curate at [[St Martin-in-the-Fields]], where his  enthusiasm and industry drew approving comments.<ref name= C4/><ref name= T3>Tucker, pp. 6<U+2013>7</ref>

==Rector of Stiffkey==

===Early years===
[[File:StJohnsChurchStiffkey.jpg|thumb|left|St John's Church, Stiffkey]] 
On 8 August 1905, as curate of St Martin's, Davidson officiated at the marriage of [[John Townshend, 6th Marquess Townshend|John Townshend]], the 6th Marquess Townshend, to Gladys Sutherst. The bride, daughter of a bankrupt Yorkshire businessman, was a failed actress in search of a title, while Townshend, unaware of her true situation, saw her as a solution to his financial problems. His family, a noble [[Norfolk]] line with a long history of public and political service, was appalled at the prospect, and threatened to have him certified if he went ahead.<ref name= T3/><ref name= C5>Cullen, pp. 38<U+2013>39</ref>{{#tag:ref|A fuller account of the circumstances of the Townshend marriage, its subsequent progress and its consequences is found in ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' obituary of the seventh Marquess (son of the sixth), who died in 2010 aged 93.<ref>{{cite news|title=Marquess Townshend|url= http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/culture-obituaries/tv-radio-obituaries/7653338/Marquess-Townshend.html|newspaper= The Daily Telegraph|date= 29 April 2010}}</ref>| group=n}} Davidson was an acquaintance of Sutherst and may have acted as a mediator between the two factions.<ref>Cullen, p. 40</ref> Whatever his role, in May 1906 Townshend rewarded him by appointing him Rector of Stiffkey with [[Morston]], two adjoining Norfolk parishes of which the marquess was [[Patronage#Ecclesiastical|patron]].{{#tag:ref|In England, every parish has a "patron" responsible for the appointment of incumbent clergy. Traditionally, patrons were members of the nobility or landed gentry; following late 20th-century legislation, most patronage passed to bishops, other church bodies or the Crown, though some remains in private hands.<ref>{{cite web|title= Clergy Appointments: Why Patronage?|url= http://www.churchsociety.org/cstrust/appointments/whypatronage.asp|publisher= Church Society Trust|accessdate= 30 May 2013}}</ref>| group=n}} This was a highly desirable living, with {{convert|60|acre|ha}} of [[Glebe|glebe land]], a large [[Georgian architecture|Georgian]] rectory, and an income in 1906 of <U+00A3>503 per annum, rising during Davidson's incumbency to <U+00A3>800.<ref name= T3/>{{#tag:ref|Cullen indicates that this was a very handsome living. Thirty years later, only about half of the Church of England's 12,000 parishes were worth more than <U+00A3>400 a year to their incumbents and even in 1962 many clergy earned no more than <U+00A3>600 a year <U+2013> less than a bus driver's earnings.<ref name= C5/>| group=n}}

The parish of Stiffkey, close to the northern Norfolk coast, is described in a later guidebook as lying either side of the [[River Stiffkey]], with extensive salt marshes on its seaward side.<ref>Lyall, p. 27</ref>{{#tag:ref|Some sources, including [[Ronald Blythe]] (1964) and [[Matthew Parris]] (1998), maintain that the village name is pronounced "Stewkey". Davidson's principal biographers Cullen (1975) and Tucker (2007) found that the locals pronounced the name as spelt. Cullen records that "Stewkey" refers only to the "Stewkey Blues" cockles, found on the nearby seashore.<ref>Blythe, p. 156; Parris, p. 47; Tucker, p. 7; Cullen, p. 38</ref> | group=n}} At the time of Davidson's arrival in 1906 the village, with a population of around 350, was generally impoverished although, according to Tucker, it was well supplied with shops and public houses.<ref>Tucker, p. 8</ref>  Davidson was quickly on good terms with most of the villagers, who referred to him with affection as "Little Jimmy"<U+2014>he was only 5 feet 3 inches  (1.60 metres) tall.<ref name= Cullen15>Cullen, p. 15</ref><ref>Parris, p. 47</ref> He was less well regarded by the local gentry, including the main landowner, Colonel Groom, who fell out with Davidson after the priest rebuked him for keeping a mistress.<ref name= T113>Tucker, p. 113</ref>

On 9 October 1906, now settled into a prosperous living, Davidson married Molly Saurin. The Stiffkey rectory became a family home, as children were born at regular intervals.<ref name= C40>Cullen, pp. 40<U+2013>42</ref>{{#tag:ref|The first child, a daughter, was born in 1907, followed by a son in 1909, another daughter in 1911 and another son in 1913. Cullen records that as they grew older they were mainly educated away from home, and were not much exposed to the atmosphere of the Stiffkey rectory.<ref name= C40/> | group=n}} Notwithstanding his parochial and domestic responsibilities, Davidson quickly adopted the habit of spending much of the week in  London, engaged in various kinds of social work. Through his friendship with [[Reginald Kennedy-Cox]], whom he had met at Oxford,  Davidson became involved with the Malvern Mission, forerunner of the [[Dockland Settlements]], of which he later became a trustee.<ref name = T13/>{{#tag:ref|Davidson continued this work for the remainder of his years as rector. His activities in raising funds and soliciting volunteer helpers were noted with approval on a visit to the East End by [[Mary of Teck|Queen Mary]].<ref name = T13/> | group=n}} He also became chaplain to the Actors' Church Union, based at [[St Paul's, Covent Garden]], and  was frequently to be found backstage in London's theatres, ministering to the needs of showgirls<U+2014>sometimes with an unwelcomed degree of persistence.<ref name = T13>Tucker, pp. 13<U+2013>14</ref><ref>Cullen, pp. 43<U+2013>44</ref> Between 1910 and 1913 he expanded this work to Paris, to which he made regular visits, sometimes acting as a chaperone for dancers recruited by the [[Folies Berg<U+00E8>re]].<ref name= T13/><ref>Blythe, p. 171</ref> Many out-of-work and would-be actresses were invited to stay at the Stiffkey rectory<U+2014>sometimes as many as 20 at a time<U+2014>to the consternation of Molly Davidson and of some of the local establishment who feared for the morals of local farmhands. Among those most concerned was Major [[Philip Hamond]], a churchwarden at Morston, who later became Davidson's principal adversary.<ref>Cullen, pp. 42<U+2013>43 and p. 59</ref>

===First World War===
Davidson was 39 years old at the outbreak of war in 1914. In October 1915, possibly to escape the increasingly turbulent  atmosphere in the  Stiffkey rectory, he joined the [[Royal Navy]] as a [[Military chaplain|chaplain]]. He began his service on [[HMS Gibraltar (1892)|HMS ''Gibraltar'']], a depot ship based in the [[Shetland Islands]], where he irritated his shipmates by calling church parades every time another ship visited the anchorage; he had the full approval of the base commander, [[Vice Admiral]] [[Reginald Tupper|Sir Reginald Tupper]], who was known as "Holy Reggie".<ref name= C45>Cullen, pp. 45<U+2013>46</ref>{{#tag:ref|Sir Reginald Tupper (1859<U+2013>1945) retired from the Navy in 1921, and was an early member of the [[British Fascists|"British Fascisti"]], an early British fascist organisation which attracted a number of high-ranking naval and military officers.<ref>Linehan, p. 156</ref>| group=n}} Davidson's service report from ''Gibraltar''{{'}}s captain records that "he performs his duties in a perfunctory manner. Not on good terms with messmates, disregards mess rules and regulations".<ref name= T15>Tucker, pp. 15<U+2013>16</ref> In October 1916 Davidson joined [[HMS Fox (1893)|HMS ''Fox'']] in the [[Middle East]], and shortly afterwards was arrested by the naval police during a raid on a Cairo brothel. He explained that he was looking for a diseased prostitute who had been infecting his men.<ref name= C45/><ref name= T15/> Again his commanding officer's reports were negative; however, Davidson remained with the ''Fox'' until August 1918 when he was posted to [[HMS Leviathan (1901)|HMS ''Leviathan'']] in the northern Atlantic. Here, his commander was slightly more complimentary; he found Davidson "a clever writer and entertainer [who] pays attention to duty". Davidson left the Navy in March 1919.<ref name= T15/>

==="Prostitutes' Padre"===
{{Quote box|width=246px|bgcolor=#E0E6F8|align=right|quote= "The Reverend Mr Davidson's downfall&nbsp;... was girls. Not ''a'' girl, not five or six girls even, not a hundred, but the entire tremulous universe of girlhood. Shingled heads, clear cheeky eyes, nifty legs, warm, blunt-fingered workaday hands, small firm breasts and, most importantly, good strong healthy teeth, besotted him."
|salign = left |source= Ronald Blythe: ''The Rector of Stiffkey'' (1964)<ref name= Blythe157/>}}
When Davidson returned home he found that Molly was six months pregnant. The dates of his service leave during 1918 made it apparent that he was not the father. A daughter was born on 21 June 1919;  the likely father was a Canadian army colonel, Ernest Doudemain, a friend from Davidson's schooldays who had lodged at the rectory in the latter part of 1918.<ref name= T15/> Although deeply upset by his wife's infidelity, Davidson accepted the child<U+2014>who bore some resemblance to him<U+2014>as his own.{{#tag:ref|The daughter, born Pamela Cushla le Poer Davidson, lived until 2001. She always maintained that Doudemain was her real father, though she was fond of Davidson and often stayed with him in Blackpool and Skegness, after his removal from Stiffkey.<ref>{{cite news|title= Obituary: Pamela Nelson-Edwards|url= http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/1326009/Pamela-Nelson-Edwards.html|newspaper= The Daily Telegraph|date= 12 March 2001}}</ref>| group=n}} To escape  the  poisoned atmosphere in Stiffkey he applied for a year's posting as chaplain to a hill station at [[Shimla|Simla]] in India, but the opportunity  fell through.<ref name= C47>Cullen, p. 47</ref> Instead, Davidson  resumed his pre-war routine of spending his weeks in London,  departing early on Monday morning and returning late on Saturday.<ref name= Blythe157>Blythe, p. 157</ref> Sometimes, through a missed rail connection or other mishap, he was barely  in time for the Sunday morning service at Stiffkey, and sometimes he would fail  to arrive at all.<ref>Tucker, pp. 25<U+2013>26</ref><ref name="Blythe, p. 161">Blythe, p. 161</ref>

Davidson, perhaps on the basis of his youthful Thames-side rescue, had convinced himself that nearly all young girls alone in London were in need of rescue  from a life of vice.<ref name= ODNB/>  Typical of these was Rose Ellis, whom he met in  [[Leicester Square]] in September 1920. Twenty years old and living precariously from part-time prostitution, she was homeless and had no money. Davidson gave her cash for a room, and arranged to meet her the following week.<ref>Cullen, pp. 48<U+2013>49</ref> Thus began a friendship that endured for more than a decade.  Davidson brought her to the rectory, where she worked for a time in the gardens. He also tried to get her a job with a touring theatre company, took her to Paris to find employment as an [[au pair]], kept her supplied with small sums of money, and paid her medical bills when she was suffering from venereal disease.<ref>Tucker, pp. 30<U+2013>31</ref>

According to his own  estimate, Davidson approached around 150 to 200 girls a year over a period of 12 years (he later modified these figures to a total of between 500 and 1000).<ref>Cullen, p. 129</ref> His activities usually centred on the innumerable [[J. Lyons and Co.|Lyons]], [[Aerated Bread Company|ABC]] and [[Express Dairies]] teashops and their staffs of waitresses. Davidson was mesmerised, says Blythe, by "the ineffable harmonies created by starched linen crackling over young breasts and black-stockinged calves in chubby conference just below the hem of the parlourmaid's frock".<ref>Blythe, pp. 158<U+2013>59</ref> Many  rejected his advances; a number of teashops considered him a pest and barred him. Landladies took exception to his habit of visiting their female tenants at all hours of the night. Commentators believe, however, that there is little evidence  that he behaved indecently, or molested the girls; he bought them tea, found them rooms, listened to their problems and sometimes found them work on the stage or in domestic service.<ref name= ODNB/> He styled himself the "Prostitutes' Padre", and asserted to his bishop that this was "the proudest title that a true priest of Christ can hold".<ref>Cullen, p. 13</ref>

===Financial problems===
To finance his lifestyle, Davidson needed more money than his Stiffkey living could provide. He sought to improve his financial position when, in about 1920, he met Arthur John Gordon, supposedly a wealthy American company promoter but in reality an undischarged bankrupt and confidence trickster. Gordon not only persuaded Davidson to invest his own savings in a range of dubious schemes, but also got him to solicit funds from other investors.<ref name= C51>Cullen, pp. 51<U+2013>52</ref> Davidson borrowed heavily to increase his investment and by 1925 was in serious financial difficulties.{{#tag:ref|Both Tucker and Cullen record that Davidson invested around <U+00A3>5,000 with Gordon, a sum more than six times his gross stipend.<ref name= C51/><ref>Tucker, p. 17</ref> | group=n}} In February that year he failed to pay his  [[Rates (tax)|local rates]] and was threatened with imprisonment. He avoided this by borrowing from moneylenders at exorbitant interest [[Rates (tax)|rates]], but in October was forced to file a petition of bankruptcy with debts totalling <U+00A3>2,924. Eventually a settlement was reached, whereby around half of his Stiffkey stipend was applied to the reduction of his debts.<ref>Tucker, pp. 18<U+2013>19 and pp. 144<U+2013>45</ref> Somehow, however, Davidson managed to continue his London life. He never stopped believing in Gordon's essential honesty and that one day his investments would pay off.<ref>Cullen, p. 57</ref> Much of his time in London was spent, not in pursuit of girls, but looking for Gordon.<ref name="Blythe, p. 161"/>

==Downfall and deposition==

===Complaints and investigations===
{{Quote box|width=246px|bgcolor=#E0E6F8|align=left|quote= "I can earnestly assure you in the sight of God that my conscience is free from any knowledge of  breach of the moral law&nbsp;... or of vice of any form with women or girls&nbsp;... I believe with all my soul that if [Christ] were born again in London in the present day he would be found constantly walking in Piccadilly"
|salign = left |source= Letter from Davidson to the Bishop of Norwich, 9 December 1931.<ref>Quoted in Tucker, pp. 34<U+2013>35</ref>}}
Although many of Davidson's parishioners  accepted that his London rescue mission was entirely honourable, some, including Major Hamond, were less convinced. Hamond was suspicious of the stream of visitors that Davidson brought to the Stiffkey rectory and thought he was neglecting his parochial duties.<ref name= Cullen58>Cullen, pp. 58<U+2013>59</ref> In 1927 relations between the two men worsened when Davidson, in a letter which Tucker describes as "breathless in its rudeness and insensitivity", upbraided the major for clearing the ground in the Morston churchyard alongside his recently-deceased wife's grave: "Morston Churchyard is the private freehold property of the Rector of Morston&nbsp;... you have no possible right to interfere with it in any way without my permission any more than I have the right to come and annex a part of your garden."<ref>Tucker, pp. 22<U+2013>23</ref>  On one occasion, Davidson arrived late at Morston to officiate at a [[Eucharist|communion service]], having forgotten the bread and wine; enraged, Hamond ordered him back to the rectory to collect it.<ref name= Cullen58/> An even greater lapse, in Hamond's eyes, was Davidson's failure to return to Stiffkey in time to officiate at the 1930 [[Armistice Day]] ceremony at the local war memorial.<ref>Parris, p. 50</ref>

Early in 1931, advised by a cousin who was a priest, Hamond made a formal complaint against Davidson to the [[Bishop of Norwich]], the Right Reverend [[Bertram Pollock]],<ref>Tucker, pp. 27</ref> citing the rector's supposed behaviour with women in London. Under the provisions of the Clergy Discipline Act of 1892, clergy could be prosecuted in a [[Consistory Court]] for "immoral acts" and, if convicted, face punishments ranging from temporary suspension to full deposition<U+2014>"[[defrocking]]"<U+2014>from holy orders. Pollock was initially reluctant to prosecute Davidson, but was advised by his legal counsel Henry Dashwood that the case should proceed.<ref>Tucker, p. 29</ref> In search of evidence Dashwood hired a private enquiry agent, who soon found Rose Ellis and persuaded her to sign a statement detailing her 10-year association with Davidson. The statement<U+2014>which was immediately retracted by Ellis and never presented in court<U+2014>contained little indication of any intimate relationship other than that she had once lanced a boil on Davidson's bottom.<ref>Tucker, pp. 31<U+2013>32</ref>

The enquiry agent continued his activities for months.  The bishop was initially reluctant to pursue the case; Davidson believed that he was ready to replace the charges with a lesser one of indiscipline. However, Dashwood advised Pollock  that this was no longer viable. The first  national press report appeared in the ''[[The Evening News (London newspaper)|Evening News]]'' on 1 February 1932, possibly from Davidson himself. The story was picked up by other papers, with lurid headlines that created wide public interest, and the matter could no longer be suppressed.<ref>Tucker, pp. 35<U+2013>37</ref><ref name= C73>Cullen, pp. 70<U+2013>73</ref> On 7&nbsp;February 1932 the bishop received a letter from a 17-year-old girl, Barbara Harris, which contained specific allegations of immoral conduct against Davidson and promised more: "I know lots of things against him that might help you&nbsp;... He has the keys of a lot of girls{{sic}} flats and front doors."<ref name= Parris52>Parris, pp. 52<U+2013>55</ref>

===Consistory Court hearing===
The Consistory Court was convened for 29 March 1932, under the presidency of the Norwich diocesan chancellor, F. Keppel North.<ref name= P56>Parris, p. 56</ref> The charges against Davidson accused him of associating with "women of loose character", and "accosting, molesting, and importuning young females for immoral purposes".  The prosecution's case was in the hands of a high-profile legal team, headed by Roland Oliver [[Queen's Counsel|KC]] and including the future cabinet minister [[Walter Monckton]].<ref name= T42>Tucker, pp. 42<U+2013>43</ref> Davidson, meanwhile, engaged experienced lawyers to defend him, funding this partly through the sale of newspaper stories.<ref>Tucker, pp. 69<U+2013>72</ref> Because of the level of press interest, and the number of London-based witnesses involved, the court sat in [[Church House, Westminster]], rather than in [[Norwich]].<ref name= P56/>

After Oliver provided a summary account of Davidson's life in London, Barbara Harris gave evidence.<ref name= T44>Tucker, pp. 44<U+2013>48</ref> Her February letter to Pollock is described by Matthew Parris in his account of the trial as "a masterpiece of vituperation".<ref name= P56/> Davidson's lawyers failed to bring to the court's notice certain obvious differences between the handwriting in the letter and other examples of Harris's writing, a factor which might have vitiated her testimony.<ref name= T156>Tucker, pp. 156<U+2013>59</ref> Cullen likens her evidence to "a whip of scorpions" that Davidson took full in the face.<ref>Cullen, p. 124</ref>  Davidson had first met Harris in September 1930, when she was 16. He had used his favoured ploy<U+2014>affecting to confuse her with a well-known film actress<U+2014>to persuade her to take a meal with him.<ref>Cullen, pp. 94<U+2013>95</ref> He  then began regular visits to her lodgings, gave her small sums of money and promised to find her work. From time to time he shared rooms with her: "At first he kept to the chair", Harris wrote, "but after the first few nights he did not".<ref>Parris, p. 53</ref> In her evidence to the court she said she had not had intercourse with Davidson, though he had attempted this on several occasions; when she had repulsed his advances, she claimed that he had "relieved himself".<ref name= P57>Parris, pp. 57<U+2013>58</ref>

Other aspects of the odd relationship were revealed during Harris' lengthy examination and cross-examination: her visit to the Stiffkey rectory where she had been made to work as an unpaid kitchenmaid and given only a chair to sleep in;<ref name= T55>Tucker, p. 55</ref> Davidson's repeated promises to divorce his wife and marry Harris;<ref name= T44/> an incident when she and another girl, the latter in a nightgown, had danced in front of Davidson, supposedly so that he could judge their dancing abilities.<ref name= T55/> The picture that Harris' letter and evidence presented, if true, Tucker says, was that of "a man who is out of control&nbsp;... running around London entertaining teenage girls&nbsp;... adopting the guise of a kindly priest to ingratiate himself".<ref>Tucker, p. 57</ref>

Harris was followed into the witness-box by a succession of landladies, waitresses and other women, all of whom confirmed Davidson's habitual pestering without making any serious accusation of misconduct.<ref>Cullen, p. 93</ref>  When Davidson himself took to the stand, on 25 May, his light-hearted, even flippant, manner created, says Tucker, "the flavour of a comedy routine with the rector's counsel as straight man".<ref>Tucker, p. 76.</ref> Davidson's disastrous finances were aired<U+2014>he took great offence when his association with Gordon was presented as a "partnership in crime".<ref>Tucker, p. 82</ref>  He caused disbelief and amusement in the court when, questioned about the boil-lancing incident with Rose Ellis, he professed not to know what a "buttock" was, claiming: "It is a phrase I have honestly never heard. So far as I remember it is a little below the waist."<ref>Cullen, pp. 147<U+2013>48</ref> At this stage, only Harris's largely uncorroborated testimony had provided specific allegations of immorality; the rest of the evidence was inconclusive and it seemed that the prosecution might fail.<ref name= ODNB/> Davidson's cause was severely damaged, however, when Oliver produced a photograph of him, taken on 28 March 1932, with a nearly naked girl. She was Estelle Douglas, the 15-year-old daughter of one of Davidson' oldest friends. Davidson explained that the picture had been intended as a publicity shot to help the girl find work as an actress. He protested that he had  been set up, and did not know she was naked under her shawl; he thought she was wearing a bathing suit, as she had been in an earlier photograph.<ref>Tucker, pp. 87<U+2013>91</ref>  On 6 June, after closing speeches from both sides, the court adjourned until 8 July to allow the chancellor, who alone would determine the outcome, to consider his verdict.<ref>Tucker, p. 100</ref>

===Verdict, sentence, defrocking===
During the court proceedings Davidson continued to officiate at Stiffkey and Morston, although his erratic attendance meant that substitutes often had to be arranged. On 12 June 1932 the Reverend [[Richard Cattell|R.H. Cattell]] arrived to officiate at the evening service in Stiffkey. He had just begun when Davidson entered the church and attempted to seize the Bible. The two priests wrestled with the book for some seconds before Cattell yielded, telling the congregation: "As nothing short of force will prevent Mr Davidson from taking part, I can see nothing left to do but to withdraw."<ref>Cullen, p. 167</ref> The crowds of reporters and sightseers at weekends led the [[Archdeacon of Lynn]] to issue a statement deploring the "media circus" and asking that "the full spirit of worship" be restored to Sunday services.<ref>Tucker, pp. 101<U+2013>03</ref>
[[File:Blackpool tower from central pier ferris wheel .jpg|thumb|left|A 2002 photograph of Blackpool's "Golden Mile", with the 1894 tower prominent]]

On 8 July 1932  Keppel North announced his verdict; Davidson was  guilty on five counts of immorality. The sentence would be determined by the bishop; in the meantime, Davidson was entitled to seek leave to appeal to the [[Privy Council of the United Kingdom|Privy Council]].<ref>Tucker, pp. 105<U+2013>09</ref> Sorely in need of funds to meet his continuing legal expenses, Davidson reverted to his early career as a stage entertainer. On 18 July he made his debut with a variety act at the Prince's Cinema in [[Wimbledon, London|Wimbledon]] and later toured in the provinces until, possibly dissuaded by pressure from church authorities, theatres declined to book him.<ref name= T116/> He then continued his public performances by appearing in a barrel on the [[Blackpool]] sea front, or "[[Golden Mile (Blackpool)|Golden Mile]]", where thousands paid to observe him through a small window. Not everyone was impressed; one customer, recalling the event years later, said: "He was very tatty and the place stank." He shared his sea front billing with, among other attractions, "Mariana the Gorilla Girl", the "Bearded Lady from Russia" and Dick Harrow, "the world's fattest man".<ref>Tucker, pp. 127<U+2013>28</ref>

To the consternation of Hamond and some other parishioners, the bishop delayed issuing an instruction forbidding Davidson to preach. When Hamond locked the Morston church against him, the rector preached to a large congregation on the grass outside the church.<ref name= T113/> In August, Davidson's licence to minister as a priest was revoked; his last service was morning worship at Stiffkey on 21 August 1932, when around 1,000 people congregated outside the church.<ref name=T116>Tucker, pp. 116<U+2013>17</ref> That afternoon he demanded the Morston church keys from Hamond, who sent him away by turning him round and administering a substantial kick. Hamond was later fined for this assault.<ref>Cullen, p. 172</ref>

In July and again in October, Davidson was refused leave to appeal to the Privy Council on grounds of either fact or law.<ref>Parris, p. 61</ref><ref>Tucker, p. 116 and p. 120</ref> The Consistory Court reconvened for sentencing in Norwich Cathedral on 21 October. Davidson was allowed briefly to address the court; he admitted that his behaviour had been indiscreet, but regretted none of his actions and proclaimed his innocence "of any of the graver charges that have been made against me".<ref>Tucker, pp. 120<U+2013>23</ref> Then, in what Blythe describes as a "horrible little ceremony",<ref>Blythe, p. 174</ref> Bishop Pollock  delivered the most severe sentence available<U+2014>that of deposition: "Now therefore we, Bertram&nbsp;... do thereby pronounce decree and declare that the said Reverend Harold Francis Davidson being a priest and deacon ought to be entirely removed, deposed and degraded from the said offices."<ref>Cullen, p. 174</ref> Davidson was thus defrocked. As the ceremony ended he made a furious impromptu speech, denouncing the sentence and declaring his intention to appeal to the [[Cosmo Gordon Lang|Archbishop of Canterbury]].<ref>Tucker, p. 124</ref><ref name= B177>Blythe, p. 177</ref>

==Campaigning for reinstatement==

===Blackpool showman===
{{Quote box|width=246px|bgcolor=#E0E6F8|align=right|quote= "The campaign to clear his name, very real at first, declined with gimmicky tricks until it became an ''outr<U+00E9>'' side-show in which goggle-eyed holidaymakers would cram themselves to see a real live Sunday newspaper sensation."
|salign = left |source= Ronald Blythe, ''The Rector of Stiffkey'' (1964)<ref name= B177/>}}
The Consistory Court had awarded the prosecution's costs against Davidson, who now faced enormous legal bills and had no regular source of income.<ref>Tucker, p. 108</ref> His only  recourse was to return to Blackpool and resume his career as a showman; this became his milieu for the next four years, interrupted by occasional prosecutions for obstruction and a nine-day spell in prison in 1933, for non-payment of rent owing to one of his former London landladies.<ref name= C189>Cullen, pp. 189<U+2013>90</ref> He informed the press: "While I am in the barrel I shall be occupied in preparing my case".<ref name= ODNB/> Although the barrel act remained his staple performance, he introduced variations over the years: freezing in a refrigerated chamber, or being roasted in a glass-fronted oven while a mechanised devil prodded him  with a pitchfork.<ref>Cullen, p. 187</ref> In August 1935 the freezing routine led to Davidson's arrest and prosecution for attempted suicide; he won the case and was awarded <U+00A3>382 damages for false imprisonment.<ref name= C189/><ref>Tucker, p. 136</ref> How much money Davidson made from his various  acts is uncertain; Tucker believes that the main financial beneficiary was his agent, Luke Gannon.<ref>Tucker, p. 131</ref>

Molly Davidson had managed to acquire a small house in [[South Harrow]], where Davidson spent his winters.<ref name= C194>Cullen, pp. 194<U+2013>95</ref> Off-season he worked sporadically, at one time as a door-to-door book salesman and on other as a porter at [[St Pancras railway station]].<ref>Tucker, p. 139</ref>  He could not avoid press attention; in November 1936 he was arrested and fined for pestering two 16-year-old girls at [[London Victoria Station|Victoria Station]]<U+2014>he had approached them offering auditions for a leading role in a [[West End theatre|West End]] show.<ref name= T140>Tucker, pp. 140<U+2013>41</ref> That same month he interrupted a [[General Synod of the Church of England|Church Assembly]] at [[Methodist Central Hall Westminster|Central Hall, Westminster]], at which the Archbishop of Canterbury was present. Davidson was prevented from addressing the meeting, at which he dropped numerous copies of a mimeographed pamphlet titled "I Accuse", in which he listed his grievances and castigated the Church's hierarchy.<ref name= P64>Parris, p. 64</ref>

===Death in Skegness===
[[File:Skegness beach.jpg|thumb|left|250px|The seafront at Skegness (2006 photograph), showing the Skegness Amusement Park in the left-hand background]]
By 1937 interest in Davidson's Blackpool sideshows was waning and, for that summer, he accepted an invitation to join the self-styled "Captain" Fred Rye's animal-themed show in the east coast resort of [[Skegness]].<ref name= T140/> He considered this a  step upwards from what he termed "the blatant vulgarities of Blackpool".<ref>From a letter by Davidson to Rye, June 1937, quoted in Tucker, p. 142</ref> Davidson's act consisted of a 10-minute address  delivered outside a cage containing two lions, after which he would enter the cage and spend a few minutes with the lions. This required courage on Davidson's part, because he was fearful of animals.<ref name= C194/> A 16-year-old tamer, Irene Somner, supervised proceedings. The act was billed as "Daniel in a modern lion's den",<ref name= ODNB/> and attracted large audiences, including a significant number of clergy.<ref>Tucker, p. 143</ref>

On 28 July 1937, at the evening performance, Davidson gave his usual speech before entering the cage in which two lions, Freddie and Toto, were sitting quietly. Then, according to Blythe: "in scarcely credible terms, the little clergyman from Norfolk and the lion acted out the classical Christian martyrdom to the full".<ref name= B177/> Eyewitnesses later reported that after Davidson had cracked his whip and shouted,  Freddie became agitated and knocked Davidson over, before seizing him by the neck and running with him around the cage. Somner struggled to pacify the snarling Freddie, who eventually dropped the unconscious Davidson, enabling her to drag him to safety; he was badly gashed, and  had suffered a broken bone in his neck.<ref>Tucker, pp. 145<U+2013>46</ref>  An uncorroborated story circulated that while waiting for the ambulance, Davidson asked that the London newspapers be alerted in time for next day's first editions.<ref name= C197>Cullen, pp. 197<U+2013>98</ref> According to some press reports he sat up in hospital and asked visitors for details of his ordeal in the cage.<ref>{{cite news| title = Neck broken, he talks to his children |newspaper = The Daily Mirror|date= 30 July 1937|page= 27}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title= Dying ex-rector asks to hear stories of his last adventure|newspaper = The Daily Mirror| date = 31 July 1937 | pages=3<U+2013>4}}</ref> Most historians of the affair, however, believe  that Davidson never recovered consciousness. He died on 30 July, his death possibly hastened by an [[insulin]] injection administered by a doctor who believed that the former rector was a [[diabetic]]. The coroner's verdict was death by misadventure.<ref name= C197/><ref>Tucker, p. 147</ref>

Friends and well-wishers covered the expenses of the funeral, which took place on 3 August in Stiffkey churchyard. A large crowd<U+2014>around 3,000 according to Tucker<U+2014>was in attendance including, from Davidson's distant past, the Marquess and Marchioness Townshend.<ref name= T148>Tucker, pp. 148<U+2013>50</ref> Onlookers unable to get into the churchyard found vantage points on nearby walls, roofs and in trees. When the headstone was put in place it contained a line from [[Robert Louis Stevenson]]: "For on faith in man and genuine love of man all searching after truth must be founded."<ref>Cullen, p. 199</ref>

==Aftermath and appraisal==
{{Quote box|width=246px|bgcolor=#E0E6F8|align=right|quote= "We have no hesitation in saying that the conduct of the case by the Bishop's legal advisers was tragically ill-advised&nbsp;... A Consistory Court is still, in the eyes of the law, a Court Christian. We might at least have expected in it a higher tone than we get in secular courts. We did not find it&nbsp;... the spirit in which [the proceedings] were conducted has shocked the public conscience."
|salign = left |source= From the ''[[Church Times]]'', 15 July 1932, quoted in Tucker, p. 115.<ref name= T115>From the ''[[Church Times]]'', 15 July 1932, quoted in Tucker, p. 115</ref>}}
In Skegness,  Rye saw Davidson's death as a business opportunity; crowds flocked to see "The Actual Lion that Mauled and Caused the Death of the Ex-Rector of Stiffkey".<ref name= T148/> By contrast, Molly Davidson's financial situation was desperate. When her family applied to the church authorities for help, Archbishop Lang acted on her behalf behind the scenes and eventually she received grants from two church charities.<ref>Tucker, pp. 161<U+2013>62</ref> She died in a [[Dulwich]] nursing home in 1955.<ref name= T160>Tucker, p. 160</ref> Of the other major participants in the legal case, Pollock remained as Bishop of Norwich until his resignation in 1942, a year before his death.<ref>{{cite web|last= Grimley|first= Matthew|title= Pollock, Bertram (1863<U+2013>1943)|url= http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/35561|publisher= Oxford Dictionary of National Biography Online edition|accessdate= 15 June 2013}} {{subscription}}</ref> Davidson's girls<U+2014>Rose Ellis, Barbara Harris, Estelle Douglas and the rest<U+2014>disappeared from public view after the 1932 trial, although a 1934 letter from Davidson indicates that Harris was then working at the London store [[Selfridges]], under the name "Babs Simpson".<ref name= T164>Tucker, p. 164</ref> When announcing  a 2010 book about the war artist [[Leslie Cole (artist)|Leslie Cole]], The Fleece Press revealed that Harris had married Cole after changing her name and had thereafter successfully concealed her true identity from all enquirers. Even her husband may not have known of her past.<ref>{{cite web|title= Recent Publications|url= http://www.fleecepress.com/page2/page2.html|publisher= The Fleece Press|accessdate= 23 June 2013}}</ref>{{#tag:ref|Book details: {{cite book|last= Yorke|first= Malcolm|title= "Today I worked well <U+2013> the picture fell off the brush".

After Davidson's death and burial, press attention withered as newspapers concentrated on more significant events in the years before the Second World War.<ref name= T160/> In the decades after the war interest in the affair was periodically revived. In 1963 Blythe, deemed by Parris to be the affair's "best historian",<ref name= P64/> published his account. Later in the 1960s, two stage musical versions were produced: ''The Stiffkey Scandals of 1932'', which appeared in [[Edinburgh]] in 1967 and London in 1968,<ref>{{cite web|title= Stiffkey Scandals of 1932|url= http://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/oi/authority.20110810105935601|publisher= Oxford Reference|accessdate= 15 June 2013}} {{subscription}}</ref> and ''God Made the Little Red Apple'', staged in Manchester in 1969.  Neither of these productions was commercially successful; when the former was adapted for television, the ''Daily Telegraph''{{'}}s critic questioned the artistic justification for a musical about "so sad and peculiar a person".<ref name= C197/> In the 1970s Davidson's case was the subject of a radio  documentary,  ''A Proper Little Gent'', and in 1994 an episode of BBC Television's ''Matter of Fact'' series examined the affair.<ref name= T164/> In 2007 John Walsh published a fictionalised account of Davidson's life, ''Sunday at the Cross Bones'' (Fourth Estate), in which, according to the ''Guardian'' review, Davidson is depicted as "well-meaning but ineffectual, bewildered by the world's wickedness and his own barely acknowledged desires".<ref>{{cite news|last= Poster|first= Jem|title= Oh father!|url= http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2007/may/26/featuresreviews.guardianreview21|newspaper= The Guardian|date= 26 May 2007}}</ref> Cullen's biography posits a theory that multiple personalities led Davidson to behave in different ways in differing circumstances.<ref name= Cullen15/> Robert Brown, in a biographical sketch for the ''[[Dictionary of National Biography#Oxford Dictionary of National Biography|Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]]'', suggests that what really motivated Davidson will never be known.<ref name= ODNB/>

The question of Davidson's treatment by the Consistory Court was first raised by the ''[[Church Times]]'' immediately after the trial. A leading article argued that, although Davidson's conduct had been "foolish and eccentric", his intentions at least at the start of his ministry had been guided by idealism. Chancellor North was criticised both for lacking compassion and for the general conduct of the proceedings: "No experienced criminal solicitor could conceivably have blundered so badly and consistently."<ref name= T115/> In 2006 Davidson's granddaughter, Karylin Collier, privately published a brief biography, ''The Rector of Stiffkey: His Life and Trial'', in which she maintains the innocence of all the charges against him.<ref>{{cite web|title= The Rector of Stiffkey: His Life and Trial|url= http://www.rectorofstiffkey.co.uk/about.php|publisher= rectorofstiffkey.co.uk|accessdate= 15 June 2013}}</ref> Tucker argues that "Harold Davidson probably deserved to be quietly defrocked for his shortcomings as a priest", but nevertheless believes that he was not an immoral man. He also highlights the incompetent presentation of Davidson's case by his legal team, particularly their failure to question the provenance of the Barbara Harris letter. Tucker concludes that since the proceedings were flawed and the evidence of immorality flimsy, the Church of England owes it to the Davidson family to re-examine the original findings.<ref name= T156/>

The writer-historian [[A. N. Wilson]] summarises Davidson as a "Tragic buffoon cum Christian Martyr".<ref>Wilson, p. 317</ref> In his history of Britain in the inter-war years, [[A. J. P. Taylor]] writes that "Davidson offered a parable of the age. He attracted more attention than, say, Cosmo Gordon Lang, archbishop of Canterbury. Which man deserves a greater place in the history books?"<ref>Taylor, p. 396</ref>
