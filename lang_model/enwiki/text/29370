==Early service==
Otto Fruhnner was originally an aviation mechanic, starting in late 1914. He then underwent pilot training, and flew as an  enlisted pilot of two seater aircraft on the [[Eastern Front (World War I)|Eastern Front]] against the Russians. He then volunteered for fighter duty, and was assigned to [[Jagdstaffel 26]].<ref name="Franks 2000 54">{{cite book |title=Albatros Aces of World War I |last=Franks |first=Norman |authorlink=Norman Franks |year=2000 |publisher=Osprey Publishing |isbn=1855329603, 9781855329607 |page=54 }}</ref>

==Fighter service==
His combat successes began when he was serving in [[Jagdstaffel 26]]. He shot down two [[Sopwith]]s in two separate engagements on 3 September 1917.

There was a four month lapse. Then, on 3 January 1918, he scored for the third time, and continued his success through March, with his 9th victory on the 26th.<ref name="theaerodrome.com"/> On 3 June, he was awarded the Prussian [[Military Merit Cross]], the highest award for valor available to enlisted men in the German military. <ref>http://www.theaerodrome.com/medals/germany/prussia_mmc.php?pageNum_recipients=1&totalRows_recipients=22#recipients</ref>
There was another lapse of three months; then on 1 July, he downed his tenth victim to become an [[<U+00DC>berkanone]]. From that point on, he accrued victories until 4 September 1918.<ref name="theaerodrome.com"/> On the 4th, he shot down three [[Sopwith Camel]]s from 70 Squadron of the [[Royal Air Force]] as his share of the eight losses by the British; this dogfight was the largest loss of fighters ever suffered by the RAF in a single engagement in [[World War I]].

Fruhner was subsequently commissioned. He was also proposed for the [[Pour le Merite]], the German military's highest award for bravery. The [[Pour le Merite]] was reserved for officers, just as the [[Military Merit Cross]] was for enlisted men.<ref name="Franks 2003 80 - 81">{{cite book |title=Fokker D VII Aces of World War I |last=Franks |first=Norman |authorlink=Norman Franks |coauthors=Greg VanWyngarden |year=2003 |publisher=Osprey Publishing |isbn=1841765333, 9781841765334 |pages=80 - 81 }}</ref> There were only five German aces who won both awards.<ref>http://www.theaerodrome.com/forum/people/17880-pour-le-merite-hans-ziegler-fl-abt-270-a.html</ref> However, the Kaiser abdicated before approving the award.<ref name="Franks 2003 80 - 81"/>

On 20 September 1918, while in a dogfight with [[Sopwith Camel]]s of 203 Squadron of the [[Royal Air Force]], he collided with one of them. Although injured, he leapt from his irreparably damaged aircraft and parachuted to safety. The Camel he had collided with crashed; it was credited as Fruhner's 27th victory.<ref name="theaerodrome.com"/><ref name="ejection-history.org.uk"/><ref name="Franks 2003 80 - 81"/>

==Post World War I service==
In 1935, Fruhner joined the [[Luftwaffe]] as a major commanding a flying school. He later rose in rank in the [[Luftwaffe]] during World War II.<ref name="Franks 2000 54"/> Remaining in training commands, he eventually attained the rank of Generalmajor.<ref name="Franks 2003 80 - 81"/>
