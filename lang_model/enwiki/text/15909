The '''Crusades''' were a series of military conflicts of a [[religious war|religious character]] waged by [[Christians]] during [[1095]]<U+2013>[[1291]], most of which were sanctioned by the [[Pope]] in the name of [[Christendom]].<ref> This term refers to a particular polity of the [[Medieval]] world.</ref> The Crusades originally had the goal of recapturing [[Jerusalem]] and the [[sacred]] "[[Holy Land]]" from [[Muslim]] rule and were originally launched in response to a call from the [[Eastern Orthodox]] [[Byzantine Empire]] for help against the expansion of the Muslim [[Seljuq dynasty]] into [[Anatolia]].<ref name="CathEnc">''Crusades'' in ''The New Catholic Encyclopedia'', New York: McGraw-Hill Book Company, 1966, Vol. IV, p. 504.</ref><ref> The Seljuk were a dynasty who ruled a [[Turkic peoples|Turkic]] branch of the [[Central Asia]]n [[Oguz]] and had recently overrun the [[Ghaznavid]]s, [[Buyid]]s and other dynasties contesting the authority of the [[Abbassid]] [[caliphate]]. They converted to [[Islam]] and established themselves as [[de facto]] rulers who only formally acknowledged the caliph's suzerainty. The "''[[ghazw]]at''" into Anatolia of the various [[Turcoman]] tribes nominally under their banner led to the Byzantine Emperor's call for assistance from the Christian West.</ref>

The term is also used to describe contemporaneous and subsequent campaigns conducted through the 16th century in territories outside  [[the Levant]]<ref>such as Muslim territories in [[Al Andalus]], [[Ifriqiya]], and [[Egypt]], as well as in [[Eastern Europe]]</ref>, usually against [[pagan]]s, those considered by the [[Catholic Church]] to be [[heretic]]s, and peoples under the ban of [[excommunication]]<ref name="CathEnc"/> for a mixture of religious, economic, and political reasons.<ref>''e.g.'' the [[Albigensian Crusade]],  the [[Aragonese Crusade]], the [[Reconquista]] and the [[Northern Crusades]].</ref>  Rivalries among both Christian and Muslim powers led also to alliances between religious factions against their opponents, such as the Christian alliance with the [[Sultanate of Rum]] during the [[Fifth Crusade]].  The traditional numbering scheme for the Crusades includes the nine major expeditions to the Holy Land during the 11th to 13th centuries.  Other unnumbered "crusades" continued into the 16th century, lasting until the political and religious climate of Europe was significantly changed during the [[Renaissance]] and [[Reformation]]. 

The [[Children's Crusade]] was not a military campaign, but probably a popular uprising in [[France]] and/or [[Germany]], possibly with the intention of reaching the Holy Land in order to convert Muslims there peacefully to Christianity. 

The Crusades had far-reaching political, economic, and social impacts, some of which have lasted into contemporary times. Because of internal conflicts among Christian kingdoms and political powers, some of the crusade expeditions (such as the [[Fourth Crusade]]) were diverted from their original aim and resulted in the sack of a Christian city, the Byzantine capital, [[Constantinople]]. The [[Sixth Crusade]] was the first crusade to set sail without the official blessing of the Church, establishing the precedent that rulers other than the Pope could initiate a crusade.

=== Jerusalem falls to the Sassanids ===
Byzantium lost control of Jerusalem and the [[True Cross]] in [[614]] to [[Chosroes II]], ruler of [[Sassanid Empire]]. The Byzantine emperor [[Heraclius]] incited a religious zeal in his troops that allowed him to defeat [[Persian]]s and reconquer Jerusalem. He motivated his soldiers calling them "soldiers of the Cross". Because of that [[John Julius Norwich]] calls Heraclius "The First Crusader".

=== Middle Eastern situation ===
Muslim presence in the Holy Land goes back to the initial [[Arab]] conquest of [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] in the 7th century. This did not interfere much with [[pilgrimage]] to Christian holy sites or the security of monasteries and Christian communities in the Holy Land, and western Europeans were less concerned with the loss of far-away Jerusalem than, in the ensuing decades and centuries, the invasions by Muslims and other hostile non-Christians, such as the [[Vikings]], heathen [[Slavs]] and [[Magyars]]. However, the Muslim armies' successes were putting strong pressure on the [[Eastern Orthodox]] Byzantine Empire.

Another turning point attributed to the change in western attitudes towards the east came in the year 1009, when the [[Fatimids|Fatimid]] caliph, [[al-Hakim bi-Amr Allah]] ordered the [[Church of the Holy Sepulchre]] destroyed. In 1039 his successor permitted the Byzantine Empire to rebuild it. <ref>Denys Pringle "Architecture in Latin East" in ''The Oxford History of the Crusades'' ed. Jonathan Riley-Smith (New York:Oxford University Press,1999) 157</ref> Pilgrimages were allowed to the Holy Lands before and after the Sepulchre was rebuilt but for a time pilgrims were captured and some of the clergy were killed. The conquerers however eventually realized that the wealth of Jerusalem came from the pilgrims. After they realized this the persecution of pilgrims stopped.<ref>Thomas F Madden ''A Concise History of the Crusades'' (Lanham:Rowman & Littlefield Publishers Inc, 1999) 5</ref> However the damage was already done, the violence of the Seljuk Turks became part of the propaganda that spread the passion for the crusades. <ref>Thomas F Madden ''A Concise History of the Crusades'' (Lanham:Rowman & Littlefield Publishers Inc, 1999) 8 </ref>

=== Western European situation ===
The origins of the crusades lie in developments in [[Western Europe]] earlier in the [[Middle Ages]], as well as the deteriorating situation of the [[Byzantine Empire]] in the east caused by a new wave of Turkish Muslim attacks. The breakdown of the [[Carolingian Empire]] in the late 9th century, combined with the relative stabilisation of local European borders after the Christianization of the [[Vikings]], [[Slavs]], and [[Magyars]], had produced a large class of armed warriors whose energies were misplaced fighting one another and terrorizing the local populace. The Church tried to stem this violence with the [[Peace and Truce of God]] movements, which was somewhat successful, but trained warriors always sought an outlet for their violence, and opportunities for territorial expansion were becoming less attractive for large segments of the nobility. One exception was the ''[[Reconquista]]'' in [[Spain]] and [[Portugal]], which at times occupied Iberian [[knights]] and some [[mercenaries]] from elsewhere in Europe in the fight against the Islamic [[Moors]], who had attacked and successfully overrun most of the [[Iberian Peninsula]] over the preceding two centuries.

In 1063, [[Pope Alexander II]] had given papal blessing to Iberian Christians in their wars against the Muslims, granting both a papal standard (the ''vexillum sancti Petri'') and an [[indulgence]] to those who were killed in battle. Pleas from the Byzantine Emperors, now threatened under by the [[Seljuks]], thus fell on ready ears. These occurred in 1074, from Emperor [[Michael VII]] to [[Pope Gregory VII]] and in 1095, from Emperor [[Alexius I Comnenus]] to [[Pope Urban II]].

[[Image:Almoravid map reconquest loc.jpg|thumb|250px|Map of the Iberian Peninsula at the time of the Almoravid arrival in the 11th Century- Christian Kingdoms included '''A'''rag<U+00F3>n, '''C'''astile, '''L'''eon, '''N'''avarre, and '''P'''ortugal]]

The Crusades were, in part, an outlet for an intense religious piety which rose up in the late 11th century among the lay public. A crusader would, after pronouncing a solemn vow, receive a cross from the hands of the pope or his [[papal legate|legate]]s, and was thenceforth considered a "soldier of the Church". This was partly because of the [[Investiture Controversy]], which had started around 1075 and was still on-going during the First Crusade. As both sides of the Investiture Controversy tried to marshal public opinion in their favor, people became personally engaged in a dramatic religious controversy. The result was an awakening of intense Christian piety and public interest in religious affairs. This was further strengthened by religious propaganda, advocating [[Just War]] in order to retake the Holy Land&mdash;which included Jerusalem (where the [[Death of Jesus|death]], [[Resurrection of Jesus|resurrection]] and [[ascension]] into [[heaven]] of [[Jesus]] took place according to Christian theology) and [[Antioch]] (the first Christian city)&mdash;from the Muslims. Further, the remission of sin was a driving factor. This provided any god-fearing men, who had committed sin, as an irresistible way out of eternal damnation in hell. It was a hotly debated issue throughout the crusades as what exactly "remission of sin" meant. Most believed that by retaking Jerusalem they would go straight to heaven after death. However, much controversy goes to what exactly was promised by the popes of the time. One theory was that you had to die fighting for Jerusalem for the remission to apply. This is closer to what pope Urban II said in his speeches. This meant that if the crusaders were successful, and retook Jerusalem, the survivors would not be given remission. Another theory was that if you reached Jerusalem, you would be relieved of the sins you had committed before the crusade. Therefore you could still be sentenced to hell for sins committed after the crusades.

All of these factors were manifested in the overwhelming popular support for the First Crusade and the religious vitality of the 12th century.

=== Immediate cause ===
[[Image:CouncilofClermont.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Pope [[Urban II]] at the [[Council of Clermont]], where he preached an impassioned sermon to take back the Holy Land.]] 
The immediate cause of the First Crusade was [[Alexios I Komnenos|Alexius I]]'s appeal to [[Pope Urban II]] for mercenaries to help him resist Muslim advances into territory of the Byzantine Empire. In [[1071]], at the [[Battle of Manzikert]], the Byzantine Empire had been defeated, and this defeat led to the loss of all but the coastlands of Asia Minor (modern [[Turkey]]). Although the [[East-West Schism]] was already beginning to brew between the Catholic Western church and the [[Eastern Orthodox church]], Alexius I hoped for a positive response. However, the response was much larger, and less helpful, than Alexius I desired. The Pope called for a large invasion force to not merely defend the Byzantine Empire, but also to retake Jerusalem.

When the First Crusade was preached in 1095, the Christian princes of northern Iberia had been fighting their way out of the mountains of [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]] and [[Asturias]], the [[Basque Country (historical territory)|Basque Country]] and [[Navarre]], with increasing success, for about a hundred years. The fall of Moorish [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]] to the [[Kingdom of Le<U+00F3>n]] in 1085 was a major victory, but the turning points of the ''[[Reconquista]]'' still lay in the future. The disunity of the Muslim emirs was an essential factor, and the Christians, were hard to beat: they knew nothing except fighting, they had no gardens or libraries to defend, and they worked their way forward through alien territory populated by [[infidel]]s, where the Christian fighters felt they could afford to wreak havoc. All these factors were soon to be replayed in the fighting grounds of the East. Spanish historians have traditionally seen the ''Reconquista'' as the molding force in the [[Castile (historical region)|Castilian]] character, with its sense that the highest good was to die fighting for the Christian cause of one's country.

While the ''[[Reconquista]]'' was the most prominent example of Christian reaction against Muslim conquests, it is not the only such example. The [[Normans|Norman]] adventurer [[Robert Guiscard]] had conquered the "toe of Italy," Calabria, in 1057 and was holding what had traditionally been Byzantine territory against the Muslims of [[Sicily]]. The maritime states of [[Pisa]], [[Genoa]] and [[Catalonia]] were all actively fighting Islamic strongholds in [[Majorca]] and [[Sardinia]], freeing the coasts of Italy and Catalonia from Muslim raids. Much earlier, the Christian homelands of [[Syria]], [[Lebanon]], Palestine, [[Egypt]], and so on had been conquered by Muslim armies. This long history of losing territories to a religious enemy created a powerful motive to respond to Byzantine emperor Alexius I's call for holy war to defend Christendom, and to recapture the lost lands, starting at Jerusalem.

The papacy of [[Pope Gregory VII]] had struggled with reservations about the doctrinal validity of a holy war and the shedding of blood for the Lord and had, with difficulty, resolved the question in favour of justified violence. More importantly to the Pope, the Christians who made pilgrimages to the Holy Land were being persecuted. Actions against [[Arianism|Arians]] and other heretics offered historical precedents in a society where violence against nonbelievers<U+2014>and indeed against other Christians<U+2014>was acceptable and common. Saint [[Augustine of Hippo]], Gregory's intellectual model, had justified the use of force in the service of Christ in ''[[The City of God]]'', and a Christian "[[just war]]" might enhance the wider standing of an aggressively ambitious leader of Europe, as Gregory saw himself. The northerners would be cemented to [[Rome]], and their troublesome knights could see the only kind of action that suited them. Previous attempts by the church to stem such violence, such as the concept of the "Peace of God", were not as successful as hoped. To the south of Rome, Normans were showing how such energies might be unleashed against both Arabs (in Sicily) and Byzantines (on the mainland). A Latin hegemony in the Levant would provide leverage in resolving the Papacy's claims of supremacy over the [[Patriarch of Constantinople]], which had resulted in the [[Great Schism]] of 1054, a rift that might yet be resolved through the force of Frankish arms.

In the Byzantine homelands, the Eastern Emperor's weakness was revealed by the disastrous defeat at the [[Battle of Manzikert]] in 1071, which reduced the Empire's Asian territory to a region in western Anatolia and around Constantinople. A sure sign of Byzantine desperation was the appeal of Alexius I Comnenus to his enemy, the Pope, for aid. But Gregory was occupied with the [[Investiture Controversy]] and could not call on the German emperor, so a crusade never took shape.

For Gregory's more moderate successor, Pope Urban II, a crusade would serve to reunite Christendom, bolster the Papacy, and perhaps bring the East under his control. The disaffected Germans and the Normans were not to be counted on, but the heart and backbone of a crusade could be found in Urban's own homeland among the northern French.

=== After the First Crusade ===

On a popular level, the first crusades unleashed a wave of impassioned, personally felt pious Christian fury that was expressed in the massacres of [[Jew]]s that accompanied the movement of the Crusader mobs through Europe, as well as the violent treatment of "[[schism]]atic" Orthodox Christians of the east. The violence against the Orthodox Christians culminated in the [[Fourth Crusade|sack of Constantinople]] in 1204, in which most of the crusading armies took part. During many of the attacks on Jews, local Bishops and Christians made attempts to protect Jews from the mobs that were passing through. Jews were often offered sanctuary in churches and other Christian buildings, but the mobs broke in and killed them anyway.

In the 13th century, crusades never expressed such a popular fever, and after Acre fell for the last time in 1291, and after the extermination of the Occitan [[Cathar]]s in the [[Albigensian Crusade]], the crusading ideal became devalued by Papal justifications of political and territorial aggressions within Catholic Europe.  	

The last crusading order of knights to hold territory were the [[Knights Hospitaller]]. After the final fall of Acre, they took control of the island of [[Rhodes]], and in the sixteenth century, were driven to [[Malta]]. These last crusaders were finally unseated by [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon Bonaparte]] in 1798.

==List of crusades ==

A traditional numbering scheme for the crusades totals nine during the 11th to 13th centuries, as well as other smaller crusades that are mostly contemporaneous and are unnumbered. There were frequent "minor" crusades throughout this period, not only in Palestine but also in the Iberian Peninsula and central Europe, against Muslims and also Christian heretics and personal enemies of the Papacy or other powerful monarchs. Such "crusades" continued into the 16th century, until the Renaissance and Reformation when the political and religious climate of Europe was significantly different to that of the Middle Ages.

===First Crusade 1095<U+2013>1099===
{{main|First Crusade}}
In March 1095 at the [[Council of Piacenza]], ambassadors sent by Byzantine emperor Alexius I called for help with defending his empire against the [[Seljuk Turks]]. Later that year, at the [[Council of Clermont]], Pope Urban II called upon all Christians to join a war against the Turks, promising those who died in the endeavor immediate remission of their sins<ref>[http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/source/urban2-5vers.html#Fulcher Fulcher of Chartres], Medieval Sourcebook.</ref>. Crusader armies managed to defeat two substantial Turkish forces at [[Battle of Dorylaeum|Dorylaeum]] and at [[Siege of Antioch|Antioch]], finally marching to Jerusalem with only a fraction of their original forces. In 1099, they [[Siege of Jerusalem (1099)|took Jerusalem by assault]] and massacred the population. As a result of the First Crusade, several small [[Crusader states]] were created, notably the [[Kingdom of Jerusalem]]. 

====Crusade of 1101====
{{main|Crusade of 1101}}

Following this crusade there was a second, less successful wave of crusaders. This is known as the crusade of 1101 and may be considered an adjunct of the First Crusade.

===Second Crusade 1145<U+2013>1149===
[[Image:Europe 1142.jpg|thumb|right|300px|The state of Europe in 1142]]
{{main|Second Crusade}}
After a period of relative peace in which Christians and Muslims co-existed in the Holy Land, Muslims conquered the town of [[County of Edessa|Edessa]]. A new crusade was called for by various preachers, most notably by [[Bernard of Clairvaux]]. French and German armies, under the Kings [[Louis VII of France|Louis VII]] and [[Conrad III of Germany|Conrad III]] respectively, marched to Jerusalem in 1147 but failed to accomplish any major successes, and indeed endangered the survival of the Crusader states with a strategically foolish attack on [[Damascus]]. By 1150, both leaders had returned to their countries without any result.  St. Bernard of Clairvaux, who in his preachings had encouraged the Second Crusade, was upset with the amount of misdirected violence and slaughter of innocent people, especially the Jewish and Muslim population of the Rhineland.<ref>''Crusades'' in ''The New Catholic Encyclopedia'', New York: McGraw-Hill Book Company, 1966, Vol. IV, p. 508.</ref>

===Third Crusade 1189<U+2013>1192===
{{main|Third Crusade}}
In 1187, [[Saladin]], Sultan of Egypt, recaptured Jerusalem. [[Pope Gregory VIII]] called for a crusade, which was led by several of Europe's most important leaders: [[Philip II of France]], [[Richard I of England]] and [[Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor]]. Frederick drowned in [[Cilicia]] in 1190, leaving an unstable alliance between the English and the French. Philip left, in 1191, after the Crusaders had recaptured Acre from the Muslims. The crusader army headed down the coast of the [[Mediterranean Sea]]. They defeated the Muslims near Arsuf and were in sight of Jerusalem. However, the inability of the crusaders to thrive in the locale because of inadequate food and water resulted in an empty victory. Richard left the following year after establishing a truce with Saladin.

On Richard's way home, his ship was wrecked and he ended up in [[Austria]], where his enemy, Duke Leopold, captured him. The Duke delivered Richard to the Emperor [[Henry VI, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry VI]], who held the King for ransom. By 1197, Henry felt ready for a crusade, but he died in the same year of [[malaria]]. Richard I died during fighting in Europe and never returned to the Holy Land. The Third Crusade is sometimes referred to as the Kings' Crusade.

===Fourth Crusade 1201<U+2013>1204===
{{main|Fourth Crusade}}
The Fourth Crusade was initiated in 1202 by [[Pope Innocent III]], with the intention of invading the Holy Land through Egypt. Because the Crusaders lacked the funds to pay for the fleet and provisions that they had contracted from the [[Venice|Venetians]], [[Doge of Venice|Doge]] [[Enrico Dandolo]], enlisted them to restore to obedience the Christian city of Zara ([[Zadar]]). Because they subsequently lacked provisions and time on their vessel lease the leaders decided to go to [[Constantinople]], where they attempted to place a Byzantine exile on the throne. After a series of misunderstandings and outbreaks of violence, the crusaders sacked the city in 1204.  	

===Albigensian Crusade===
{{main|Albigensian Crusade}}

The [[Albigensian]] Crusade was launched in 1209 to eliminate the [[heresy|heretical]] [[Cathars]] of [[Occitania]] (the south of modern-day [[France]]). It was a decades-long struggle that had much more to do with the concerns of northern France to extend its control southwards than it did with heresy. In the end, both the Cathars and the independence of southern France were exterminated.

===Children's Crusade===
{{main|Children's Crusade}}

The Children's Crusade is a series of possibly fictitious or misinterpreted events of [[1212]]. The story is that an outburst of the old popular enthusiasm led a gathering of children in France and Germany, which [[Pope Innocent III]] interpreted as a reproof from heaven to their unworthy elders. The leader of the French army, Stephen, led 30,000 children. The leader of the German army, Nicholas, led 7,000 children. None of the children actually reached the Holy Land; they were either sold as slaves, settled along the route to Jerusalem, or died of hunger during the journey.

===Fifth Crusade 1217<U+2013>1221===
{{main|Fifth Crusade}}

By processions, prayers, and preaching, the Church attempted to set another crusade on foot, and the [[Fourth Council of the Lateran]] (1215) formulated a plan for the recovery of the Holy Land. In the first phase, a crusading force from [[Hungary]], [[Austria]] joined the forces of the king of Jerusalem and the prince of Antioch to take back Jerusalem. In the second phase, crusader forces achieved a remarkable feat in the capture of [[Damietta]] in Egypt in 1219, but under the urgent insistence of the [[papal legate]], Pelagius, they proceeded to a foolhardy attack on [[Cairo]], and an [[inundation]] of the [[Nile]] compelled them to choose between surrender and destruction.

===Sixth Crusade 1228<U+2013>1229===
{{main|Sixth Crusade}}

[[Emperor Frederick II]] had repeatedly vowed a crusade but failed to live up to his words, for which he was [[excommunication|excommunicated]] by the Pope in 1228. He nonetheless set sail from [[Brindisi]], landed in Palestine, and through diplomacy he achieved unexpected success: Jerusalem, [[Nazareth]], and [[Bethlehem]] were delivered to the crusaders for a period of ten years. 
[[Image:Crusade damietta.jpg|right|frame|[[Louis IX of France|Louis IX]] attacks [[Damietta]]]]

===Seventh Crusade 1248<U+2013>1254===
{{main|Seventh Crusade}}

The papal interests represented by the [[Knights Templar|Templars]] brought on a conflict with Egypt in 1243, and in the following year a [[Khwarezmian Empire|Khwarezmian]] force summoned by the latter stormed Jerusalem. The crusaders were drawn into battle at [[Battle of La Forbie|La Forbie]] in [[Gaza]]. The crusader army and its Bedouin mercenaries were outnumbered by [[Baibars]]' force of [[Khwarezmian Empire|Khwarezmian]] tribesmen and were completely defeated within forty-eight hours. This battle is considered by many historians to have been the death knell to the Kingdom of Outremer. Although this provoked no widespread outrage in Europe as the fall of Jerusalem in 1187 had done, [[Louis IX of France]] organized a crusade against Egypt from 1248 to 1254, leaving from the newly constructed port of [[Aigues-Mortes]] in southern France. It was a failure, and Louis spent much of the crusade living at the court of the crusader kingdom in Acre. In the midst of this crusade was the first [[Shepherds' Crusade]] in 1251.

===Eighth Crusade 1270===
{{main|Eighth Crusade}}

The eighth Crusade was organized by [[Louis IX of France|Louis IX]] in 1270, again sailing from Aigues-Mortes, initially to come to the aid of the remnants of the crusader states in [[Syria]]. However, the crusade was diverted to [[Tunis]], where Louis spent only two months before dying. For his efforts, Louis was later sainted (the city of St. Louis in Missouri is named for him). The Eighth Crusade is sometimes counted as the Seventh, if the Fifth and Sixth Crusades are counted as a single crusade. The Ninth Crusade is sometimes also counted as part of the Eighth.

=== Ninth Crusade 1271<U+2013>1272===
{{main|Ninth Crusade}}

The future [[Edward I of England]] undertook another expedition in 1271, after having accompanied Louis on the Eighth Crusade. He accomplished very little in Syria and retired the following year after a truce. With the fall of [[Principality of Antioch|Antioch]] (1268), [[County of Tripoli|Tripoli]] (1289), and [[Siege of Acre (1291)|Acre]] (1291), the last traces of the Christian rule in Syria disappeared.

===Northern Crusades (Baltic and Germany) ===
[[Image:nevsky2.jpg|thumb|275px|The [[Teutonic knights]] in [[Pskov]] in 1240 as depicted in [[Sergei Eisenstein]]'s ''[[Alexander Nevsky (film)|Alexander Nevsky]]'' (1938).]]
{{main|Northern Crusades}}

The Crusades in the [[Baltic Sea]] area and in [[Central Europe]] were efforts by (mostly German) Christians to subjugate and convert the peoples of these areas to Christianity. These Crusades ranged from the 12th century, contemporaneous with the Second Crusade, to the 16th century. 

Between 1232 and 1234, there was a crusade against the [[Stedingen|Stedingers]]. This crusade was special, because the Stedingers were not heathens or heretics, but fellow Roman Catholics. They were free [[Frisians|Frisian]] farmers who resented attempts of the count of [[Oldenburg (state)|Oldenburg]] and the archbishop [[Archbishopric of Bremen|Bremen-Hamburg]] to make an end to their freedoms. The archbishop excommunicated them, and the pope declared a crusade in 1232. The Stedingers were defeated in 1234.

===Other crusades=== 
====Crusade against the Tartars====

In [[1259]] Mongols ravaged the principality of [[Halych-Volynia]], [[Lithuania]] and [[Poland]], led by [[Burundai]] and [[Nogai Khan]]. After that the pope Alexander IV tried without success to create a crusade against [[Blue Horde]].

In the 14th century, Khan [[Tokhtamysh]] combined the Blue and White Hordes forming the [[Golden Horde]]. It seemed that the power of the Golden Horde had begun to rise, but in 1389, Tokhtamysh made the disastrous decision of waging war on his former master, the great [[Tamerlane]]. Tamerlane's hordes rampaged through southern [[Russia]], crippling the Golden Horde's economy and practically wiping out its defenses in those lands.

After losing the war, Tokhtamysh was then dethroned by the party of Khan Temur Kutlugh and Emir Edigu, supported by Tamerlane. When Tokhtamysh asked [[Vytautas the Great]] for assistance in retaking the Horde, the latter readily gathered a huge army which included [[Lithuania]]ns, Ruthenians, Russians, [[Mongol]]s, [[Moldavia]]ns, Poles, Romanians and [[Teutonic knights]].

In 1398, the huge army moved from Moldavia and conquered the southern steppe all the way to the [[Dnieper River]] and northern [[Crimea]]. Inspired by their great successes, Vytautas declared a 'Crusade against the Tatars' with Papal backing. Thus, in 1399, the army of Vytautas once again moved on the Horde. His army met the Horde's at the [[Vorskla River]], slightly inside Lithuanian territory.

Although the Lithuanian army was well equipped with [[cannon]], it could not resist a rear attack from Edigu's reserve units. Vytautas hardly escaped alive. Many princes of his kin<U+2014>possibly as many as 20<U+2014>were killed (for example, [[Stefan Musat]], Prince of [[Principality of Moldavia|Moldavia]] and two of his brothers, while a fourth was badly injured {{Fact|date=February 2007}}), and the victorious Tatars besieged [[Kiev]]. "And the Christian blood flowed like water, up to the Kievan walls," as one chronicler put it. Meanwhile, Temur Kutlugh died from the wounds received in the battle, and Tokhtamysh was killed by one of his own men.

====Crusades in the Balkans====

To counter the expanding [[Ottoman Empire]], several crusades were launched in the 15th century.
The most notable are:

* the '''Crusade of Nicopolis''' (1396) organized by [[Sigismund of Luxemburg]] king of Hungary culminated in the [[Battle of Nicopolis]]. It is often called the last of the crusades.
* the '''[[Crusade of Varna]]''' (1444) led by the Polish-Hungarian king [[W<U+0142>adys<U+0142>aw III of Poland|W<U+0142>adys<U+0142>aw Warne<U+0144>czyk]] ended in the [[Battle of Varna]]
* and the '''Crusade of 1456''' organized to lift the [[Siege of Belgrade]] led by [[John Hunyadi]] and [[Giovanni da Capistrano]]

====Aragonese Crusade====

The '''[[Aragonese Crusade]]''', or Crusade of Arag<U+00F3>n, was declared by Pope Martin IV against the King of Arag<U+00F3>n, Peter III the Great, in 1284 and 1285.

====Alexandrian Crusade====

The '''[[Alexandrian Crusade]]''' of October 1365 was a minor seaborne crusade against Muslim [[Alexandria]] led by Peter I of Cyprus. His motivation was at least as commercial as religious. It had limited success.

====Hussite Crusade====

The Hussite Crusade(s), also known as the "[[Hussite Wars]]," or the "Bohemian Wars," involved the military actions against and amongst the followers of Jan Hus in Bohemia in the period 1420 to circa 1434. The Hussite Wars were arguably the first European war in which hand-held gunpowder weapons such as [[musket]]s made a decisive contribution. The Hussite warriors were basically infantry, and their many defeats of larger armies with heavily armoured knights helped affect the infantry revolution. In the end, it was an inconclusive war.

====Swedish Crusades====

The [[Sweden|Swedish]] conquest of [[Finland]] in the [[Middle Ages]] has traditionally been divided into three "crusades": the [[First Swedish Crusade]] around 1155 AD, the [[Second Swedish Crusade]] about 1249 AD and the [[Third Swedish Crusade]] in 1293 AD.

The Swedish Crusade is purely legendary, and according to most historians today, never took place as described in the legend and did not result in any ties between Finland and Sweden. For the most part, it was made up in the late 13th century to date the Swedish rule in Finland further back in time. No historical record has also survived describing the second one, but it probably did take place and ended up in the concrete conquest of southwestern Finland. The third one was against [[Novgorod]], and is properly documented by both parties of the conflict.

According to archaeological finds, Finland was largely Christian already before the said crusades. Thus the "crusades" can rather be seen as ordinary expeditions of conquest whose main target was territorial gain. The expeditions were dubbed as actual crusades only in the 19th century by the national-romanticist Swedish and Finnish historians.

==Historical perspective==
=== Western and other interpretations ===

Western and Eastern [[historiography]] present variously different views on the crusades, in large part because "crusade" invokes dramatically opposed sets of associations<U+2014>"crusade" as a valiant struggle for a supreme cause, and "crusade" as a byword for barbarism and aggression. This contrasting view is not recent since Christians have in the past struggled with the tension of military activity and teachings of Christ to "love one's enemies" and to "turn the other cheek". For these reasons, the crusades have been controversial even among contemporaries.

Western sources speak of both heroism, faith and honour (emphasized in [[Romance (genre)|chivalric romance]]), but also of acts of brutality. Islamic and Orthodox Christian chroniclers tell stories of barbarian savagery and brutality<ref>Maalouf, Amin. Crusades Through Arab Eyes.</ref>. 

Likewise, some modern historians in the west express moral outrage<U+2014>for example [[Steven Runciman]], the leading western historian of the crusades for much of the 20th century, ended his history with a resounding condemnation:

:"High ideals were besmirched by cruelty and greed.. the Holy War was nothing more than a long act of intolerance in the name of God".

===Eastern Orthodoxy===
Like Muslims, Eastern Orthodox Christians also see the Crusades as attacks by "the barbarian West", but centered on the sack of Constantinople in 1204. Many relics and artifacts taken from Constantinople are still in the West, in the [[Vatican City|Vatican]] and elsewhere. Disagreement currently exists between modern Turks and Greeks over the claimant rights to the [[Horses of Saint Mark|Greek Horses]] on the facade of [[San Marco di Venezia|St. Mark's]] in [[Venice]]. The Greeks argue that the frieze is inherently part of Greek culture and identity, similar to the [[Elgin Marbles|"Elgin" Marbles]]; the Turks counter that the freize originated from what is now modern-day [[Istanbul]]. A picture of Turkish popular history of the Crusades can be assembled by compiling text of official Turkish brochures on Crusader fortifications in the Aegean coast and coastal islands. 

Countries of Central Europe, despite the fact that they also belonged to [[Western Christianity]], were the most skeptical about the idea of Crusades{{Fact|date=February 2007}}. Many cities in Hungary were sacked by passing bands of Crusaders; [[Poland|Polish]] Prince [[Leszek I the White]] refused to join a Crusade, allegedly because of the lack of [[mead]] in Palestine. Later on, Poles were themselves subject to [[Teutonic Order|conquest from the Crusaders]] and therefore championed the notion that [[Paganism|pagans]] have the right to live in peace and have property rights to their lands{{Fact|date=February 2007}}.

=== Popular reputation in Western Europe===
[[Image:Crusade.JPG|thumb|right|150px|[[Cecil B. DeMille]]'s ''[[The Crusades (film)|The Crusades]]'' (1935)]]

In Western Europe, the Crusades have traditionally been regarded by laypeople as heroic adventures, though the mass enthusiasm of common people was largely expended in the First Crusade, from which so few of their class returned. Today, the "[[Saracen]]" adversary is crystallized in the lone figure of Saladin; his adversary Richard the Lionheart is, in the [[English language|English]]-speaking world, the archetypical crusader king, while Frederick Barbarossa and Louis IX fill the same symbolic niche in German and French culture. Even in contemporary areas, the crusades and their leaders were romanticized in popular literature; the ''[[Chanson d'Antioche]]'' was a [[chanson de geste]] dealing with the First Crusade, and the [[Song of Roland]], dealing with the era of the similarly romanticized [[Charlemagne]], was directly influenced by the experience of the crusades, going so far as to replace Charlemagne's historic [[Basque people|Basque]] opponents with Muslims. A popular theme for [[troubadour]]s was the knight winning the love of his lady by going on crusade in the east. 

[[Image:Barbarossa01.jpg|thumb|left|180px|The ever-living [[Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick Barbarossa]], in his mountain cave: a late 19th century German woodcut]]
In the 14th century, [[Godfrey of Bouillon]] was united with the [[Trojan War]] and the adventures of [[Alexander the Great]] against a backdrop for military and courtly heroics of the [[Nine Worthies]] who stood as popular secular [[culture hero]]es into the 16th century, when more critical literary tastes ran instead to [[Torquato Tasso]] and Rinaldo and Armida, Roger and Angelica. Later, the rise of a more authentic sense of history among literate people brought the Crusades into a new focus for the Romantic generation in the romances of Sir [[Walter Scott]] in the early 19th century. Crusading imagery could be found even in the Crimean War, in which the United Kingdom and France were allied with the Muslim Ottoman Empire, and in  [[World War I]], especially [[Edmund Henry Hynman Allenby, 1st Viscount Allenby|Allenby's]] capture of Jerusalem in 1917.

In Spain, the popular reputation of the Crusades is outshone by the particularly Spanish history of the ''Reconquista''. [[El Cid]] is the central figure.

===Gender analysis===
While traditional historiography conceptualizes the crusades as a masculine movement symbolic of honour and male courage, women were also involved.

Women at home were intricately connected whether aware of it or not in the recruitment of crusading men.  Their encouragement and familial ties would present men friendly connections which made the prospect of taking the cross more appealing for those risking their lives. Arguably the most significant role that women played in the West during the crusades was their preservation of the home. While many men were gone to the East, women were needed to take care of the home. The most popular example is of Adele of Blois, wife of [[Stephen of Blois]] who corresponded with her husband while he was fighting and she was at home managing his fief. Men could journey to [[The Holy Land]] without having to worry about their home because their wives were in charge of their estates and families. <ref> Jonathan Riley-Smith. The First Crusaders 1096<U+2013>1131, New York, NY: Cambridge University Press 1997, 99. </ref>  

Even though most women showed their support for the crusades at home, some women took the cross themselves to go on the crusade. Aristocratic women who joined the movement often found that they had new positions of authority they did not have in the West. [[Eleanor of Aquitaine]] the wealthy queen of France and the wife of king [[Louis IX]] took the cross from [[St. Bernard of Clairvaux]] on Easter Sunday 1145 to join her husband.<ref> Roy Douglas Davis Owen. Eleanor of Aquitaine : queen and legend, Oxford, UK; Cambridge, Mass: Blackwell Publishing 1993, 22.</ref> Another woman who had ultimate political power in the East was [[Melisende of Jerusalem]], who under law gained hereditary rights to the crown upon her husband<U+2019>s death. Like Eleanor, Melisende never led troops into battle, but she did participate in acts of political diplomacy. While most women were there to help and care for the crusading men by bringing them water or raising their spirits by offering emotional support, there were women who had specific tasks which defined their feminine characteristics like the washerwoman. <ref>Susan B. Edington and Sarah Lambert ed. Gendering the Crusades, New York: Columbia University Press 2002, 98.</ref> 

The most controversial role that women had in the crusades was of course the role which threatened their femininity, actual militancy. When analyzing the primary documentation of female militancy, one must be cautious. The accounts of women fighting come mostly from Muslim historians whose aim was to portray Christian women as barbaric and ungodly because of their acts of killing.  The contrasting view from Christian accounts portray women fighting only in emergency situations for the preservation of the camps and their own lives. In these cases women are seen as more feminine while behaving like <U+2018>proper women<U+2019>. <ref>Helen Nicholson. <U+201C>Women on the Third Crusade. ''Journal of Medieval History'' (23) no.4 (1997) pp. 337.<U+201D></ref> It is essential to note that all writings of crusades came from men, and women no matter what role they played would have been interpreted objectively either way.

==Legacy==
===Europe===
The crusades have been remembered relatively favourably in western Europe (countries which were, at the time of the Crusades, Roman Catholic countries). Nonetheless, there have certainly been many vocal critics of the Crusades in Western Europe since the Renaissance.

====Politics and culture====
The Crusades had an enormous influence on the European [[Middle Ages]]. At times, much of the continent was united under a powerful [[Papacy]], but by the 14th century, the development of centralized bureaucracies (the foundation of the modern [[nation-state]]) was well on its way in France, England, [[Burgundy]], [[Portugal]], [[Crown of Castile|Castile]], and [[Aragon]] partly because of the dominance of the church at the beginning of the crusading era.

Although Europe had been exposed to [[Islamic culture]] for centuries through contacts in Iberian Peninsula and [[Sicily]], much knowledge in areas such as science, medicine, and architecture was transferred from the Islamic to the western world during the crusade era. 

The military experiences of the crusades also had their effects in Europe; for example, European [[castle]]s became massive stone structures as they were in the east, rather than smaller wooden buildings as they had typically been in the past.[citation needed]

In addition, the Crusades are seen as having opened up European culture to the world, especially Asia: 

{{cquote|The Crusades brought about results of which the popes had never dreamed, and which were perhaps the most, important of all. They re-established traffic between the East and West, which, after having been suspended for several centuries, was then resumed with even greater energy; they were the means of bringing from the depths of their respective provinces and introducing into the most civilized Asiatic countries Western knights, to whom a new world was thus revealed, and who returned to their native land filled with novel ideas... If, indeed, the Christian civilization of Europe has become universal culture, in the highest sense, the glory redounds, in no small measure, to the Crusades."
[''Catholic Encyclopedia'' <ref> Catholic Encyclopedia, "Crusades" (http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04543c.htm) </ref>]}}

Along with trade, new scientific discoveries and inventions made their way east or west. Arab advances (including the development of [[algebra]], optics, and refinement of engineering) made their way west and sped the course of advancement in European universities that led to the Renaissance in later centuries

The invasions of German crusaders prevented formation of the large Lithuanian state incorporating all Baltic nations and tribes. Lithuania was destined to become small country and forced to expand to the East looking for resources for wars with crusaders. <ref>{{lt icon}} [http://www.omni.lt/?i$9359_70693$z_373522 Tomas Baranauskas. ''Pr<U+016B>s<U+0173> sukilimas<U+2014>prarasta galimyb<U+0117> sukurti kitoki<U+0105> Lietuv<U+0105>'' (Prussian rebellion<U+2014>the lost chance of creating different Lithuania). 20 September, 2006]</ref>

====Trade====
The need to raise, transport and supply large armies led to a flourishing of trade throughout Europe. Roads largely unused since the days of [[Roman Empire|Rome]] saw significant increases in traffic as local merchants began to expand their horizons. This was not only because the Crusades ''prepared'' Europe for travel, but also because many ''wanted'' to travel after being reacquainted with the products of the Middle East. This also aided in the beginning of the Renaissance in Italy, as various Italian [[city-states]] from the very beginning had important and profitable trading colonies in the crusader states, both in the Holy Land and later in captured Byzantine territory.

Increased trade brought many things to Europeans that were once unknown or extremely rare and costly. These goods included a variety of spices, ivory, jade, diamonds, improved glass-manufacturing techniques, early forms of gun powder, oranges, apples, and other Asian crops, and many other products.

<!--UNCITED====Wider geo-political effects====
{{original research}}
Despite the ultimate defeat in the Middle East, the Crusaders were successful in regaining the Iberian Peninsula permanently and slowed down the military expansion of Islam.

The successful international coordination of Crusading forces from different countries, and the reduction (not cessation) in fighting between Christian monarchs that the crusading ideal encouraged, allowed Christian Europe to remain strong in the face of Muslim military expansionism. It is therefore likely that a considerable part of modern Christian Europe (particularly Spain, Portugal, and the Balkans) would be Muslim today had the Crusades not occurred, and it is furthermore possible that Christianity might have been largely replaced by Islam throughout Europe. <!--improper citation-nor does it work... (This is one traditional Roman Catholic perspective:  [[#Catholic Encyclopedia perspective|See below]].)-->

The achievement of preserving Christian Europe must not, however, ignore the eventual fall of the Christian Byzantine Empire, which was mostly caused by Fourth Crusade's extreme aggression against Eastern Orthodox Christianity, largely at the instigation of the infamous [[Enrico Dandolo]], the [[Doge of Venice]] and financial backer of the Fourth Crusade. The Byzantine lands had been a stable Christian state since the 4th century. After the Crusaders took Constantinople in 1204, the Byzantines never again had as large or strong a state and finally fell in 1453.

Taking into account the fall of the Byzantines, the Crusades could be portrayed as the defence of Roman Catholicism against the violent expansion of Islam, rather than the defence of Christianity as a whole against Islamic expansion. On the other hand, the Fourth Crusade could be presented as an anomaly. It is also possible to find a compromise between these two points of view, specifically that the Crusades were Roman Catholic campaigns which primarily sought to fight Islam to preserve Catholicism, and secondarily sought to thereby protect the rest of Christianity; in this context, the Fourth Crusade's crusaders could have felt compelled to abandon the secondary aim in order to retain Dandolo's logistical support in achieving the primary aim. Even so, the Fourth Crusade was condemned by the Pope of the time and is now generally remembered throughout Europe as a disgraceful failure.

===Islamic world===
The crusades had profound but localized effects upon the Islamic world, where the equivalents of "Franks" and "Crusaders" remained expressions of disdain. Muslims traditionally celebrate Saladin, the [[Kurdish people|Kurdish]] warrior, as a hero against the Crusaders. In the 21st century, some in the Arab world, such as the [[Arab independence movement]] and [[Pan-Islamism]] movement, continue to call Western involvement in the Middle East a "crusade". The Crusades were regarded by the Islamic world as cruel and savage onslaughts by European Christians.

The most devastating long term consequence of the crusades, according to historian [[Peter Mansfield (historian)|Peter Mansfield]], was the creation of an Islamic mentality that sought a retreat into isolation. He says "Assaulted from all quarters, the Muslim world turned in on itself. It became oversensitive [and] defensive<U+2026> attitudes that grew steadily worse as world-wide evolution, a process from which the Muslim world felt excluded, continued." <ref name="Peter Mansfield">A History of the Middle East, Second Edition, London: Penguin Books, 2003, p 21.</ref>.

===Jewish community===
{{main|History of the Jews and the Crusades}}

[[Image:FirstCrusade.jpg|thumb|200px|Right|1250 French Bible illustration depicts Jews (identifiable by [[Judenhut]]) being massacred by Crusaders]]
The Crusaders' atrocities against Jews in the German and Hungarian towns, later also in those of France, England, and in the massacres of Jews in Palestine and Syria have become a significant part of the [[history of anti-Semitism]], although no Crusade was ever declared against Jews. These attacks left behind for centuries strong feelings of ill will on both sides. The social position of the Jews in western Europe was distinctly worsened, and legal restrictions increased during and after the Crusades. They prepared the way for the anti-Jewish legislation of [[Pope Innocent III]] and formed the turning-point in medieval [[anti-Semitism]].

The crusading period brought with it many narratives from Jewish sources. Among the better-known Jewish narratives are the chronicles of Solomon Bar Simson and Rabbi Eliezer bar Nathan, "The Narrative of the Old Persecutions," by Mainz Anonymous, and "Sefer Zekhirah," and "The Book of Remembrance," by Rabbi Ephraim of Bonn.

===Caucasus===   	

In the [[Caucasus Mountains]] of [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], in the remote highland region of [[Khevsureti]], a tribe called the [[Khevsurs]] are thought to possibly be direct descendants of a party of crusaders who got separated from a larger army and have remained in isolation with some of the crusader culture intact. Into the 20th century, relics of armor, weaponry and chain mail were still being used and passed down in such communities. Russian serviceman and ethnographer [[Arnold Zisserman]] who spent 25 years (1842<U+2013>67) in the Caucasus, believed the exotic group of Georgian highlanders were descendants of the last Crusaders based on their customs, language, art and other evidence.<ref>''[http://hearstmuseum.berkeley.edu/exhibitions/photo2/photo2_intro.html Images from the Georgia<U+2013>Chechnya Border, 1970<U+2013>1980]'', Phoebe A. Hearst Museum of Anthropology.</ref> American traveler [[Richard Halliburton]] saw and recorded the customs of the tribe in 1935<ref>[http://www.swordhistory.com/excerpts/crusaders.html Sword and Buckler Fighting among the Lost Crusaders]. Excerpts of Halliburton's observations</ref>.

==Legacy==
Despite the failure of the Ninth Crusade to leave a permanent Western civilization of states controlling the region, over 600 years later, the European powers returned in a war against the [[Ottoman Empire]]. This time however, it was not a religious war that was the subject of the conflict but instead the interests of the individual nation-states in [[World War I]].

With the destruction of the Ottoman Empire, Lebanon and Syria ended up under the control of France. The French also occupied [[Morocco]], [[Algeria]], and [[Tunisia]], at various times during the early part of the 20th century. [[Italy]] took control of the areas that made up [[Libya]]. The [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|British]] took control of the areas that became [[Iraq]], [[Palestine]], and [[Trans-Jordan]].

==Etymology and use of the term "crusade"==
:''For other uses of the term "crusade", see [[Crusade (disambiguation)]].''
{{wiktionarypar|Crusade}}

The crusades were never referred to as such by their participants. The original crusaders were known by various terms, including ''fideles Sancti Petri'' (the faithful of [[Saint Peter]]) or ''milites Christi'' (knights of Christ). They saw themselves as undertaking an ''iter'', a journey, or a ''peregrinatio'', a pilgrimage, though pilgrims were usually forbidden from carrying arms. Like pilgrims, each crusader swore a vow (a ''votus''), to be fulfilled on successfully reaching Jerusalem, and they were granted a cloth cross (''crux'') to be sewn into their clothes. This "taking of the cross", the ''crux'', eventually became associated with the entire journey; the word "crusade" (coming into English from the [[French language|French]] ''croisade'', the [[Italian language|Italian]] ''crociata'', the [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] ''cruzada'', or the German ''Kreuzzug'') developed from this. 

Since the 17th century, the term "crusade" has carried a connotation in the [[Western world|West]] of being a righteous campaign, usually to "root out [[evil]]", or to fight for a just cause. In a non-historical common or theological use, "crusade" has come to have a much broader emphatic or religious meaning<U+2014>substantially removed from "armed struggle." 

In a broader sense, "crusade" can be used, always in a [[rhetoric]]al and [[metaphor]]ical sense, to identify as righteous any war that is given a [[religion|religious]] or [[morality|moral]] justification.

Ardent activists may also refer to their causes as "crusades," as in the "Crusade against Adult Illiteracy," or a "Crusade against Littering." In recent years, however, the use of "crusade" as a positive term has become less frequent in order to avoid giving offense to Muslims or others offended by the term. The term may also sarcastically or pejoratively characterize the [[zealotry]] of agenda promoters, for example with the monicker "Public Crusader" or the campaigns "Crusade against abortion," and the "Crusade for prayer in public schools."
