'''Superman''' is a [[fictional character]] regarded as one of the the most influential and popular [[superheroes]] of all time. Created by [[Canada|Canadian]] artist [[Joe Shuster]] and [[United States|American]] writer [[Jerry Siegel]] in [[1932]] while both were growing up in [[Cleveland, Ohio]], and sold to [[DC Comics|Detective Comics, Inc.]] in 1938, Superman first appeared in ''[[Action Comics]]'' #1 (June 1938) and subsequently appeared in various [[radio serial]]s, [[television program]]s, [[film]]s, [[Superman (comic strip)|newspaper strips]], and [[video game]]s. He has since become one of the world's most recognized superheroes. Today the character's adventures are published in a [[List of Superman comics|number of comic books]].

As portrayed in ''Action Comics'' #1, Superman was born on the planet [[Krypton (planet)|Krypton]] as '''Kal-El''', and rocketed to Earth as an infant by his scientist father moments before the planet's destruction. The rocket landed on Earth where a passing elderly farm couple found the baby and adopted him. As the child grew to adulthood he discovered that he possessed powers far beyond those of mortal men and resolves to use his powers to help others. To keep his identity secret when not fighting the forces of evil as Superman he lives among humanity as "mild-mannered" '''[[Clark Kent]]''', a reporter for ''The Daily Star'' (later changed to ''The [[Daily Planet]]'')<!--Leave in this order-->. Clark works alongside reporter [[Lois Lane]], with whom he is romantically involved &mdash; and married to in current comics continuity.

Some of his nicknames include "The Man of Steel" (his most famous), "The Man Of Tomorrow", "The Last Son of Krypton", and "Metropolis' Favorite Son".

==Character history==
The story of Superman's origin parallels those of other cultural [[hero]]es and religious figures such as [[Jesus]], [[Moses]], [[Gilgamesh]], [[Samson]], or [[Krishna]], who were spirited away as infants from places where they were in danger. However, facts of his origin, as well as relationships and abilities, have changed significantly over time. Editors and writers used the process of "retroactive continuity", or "[[retcon]]", to adjust to changes in popular culture, eliminate restrictive segments of the mythos, and permit contemporary storylines. These changes are intended to retain the core elements that make Superman an iconic character.

===Golden Age version===
{{seealso|Kal-L}}
As shown in the original [[Golden Age of comic books|Golden Age]] comics &mdash; including ''[[Action Comics]]'' #1 (1938), ''[[Superman (comic book)|Superman]]'' (Vol. 1) #1 (1939), and ''Superman'' (Vol. 1) #61 (1949), as well as in later stories such as ''[[Secret Origins]]'' (Vol. 2) #1 (1986) &mdash; noted scientist Jor-L discovers his planet of Krypton is about to explode yet is unable to convince his fellow Kryptonians to save themselves. However, he manages to construct a spaceship to save his infant son, Kal-L. The ship launches just as the planet explodes, with Kal-L landing on Earth in a farm country town (later known as Smallville) around the time of [[World War I]]. The Kents (at this time named "John" and "Mary"), passing motorists who witness the landing, take the infant to an [[orphanage]] and soon return to adopt the child, naming him "Clark". In his 1942 novel George Lowther changes the names "Jor-L", "Kal-L", and "Lora" (Superman's birth mother) to the more modern "[[Jor-El]]", "Kal-El", and "Lara".

Clark grows up on the Kent family farm, slowly discovering that he possesses various superpowers but unaware of his Kryptonian origins. After the deaths of his parents, Clark decides to use his powers for the benefit of humanity, constructing a stylized costume and moving to the nearby city of Metropolis. Clark begins work as a reporter at the newspaper ''The Daily Star'' and soon makes his debut as the world's first superhero, Superman.

Superman's powers develop during the 1940s, including vast increases in strength and gaining the ability to fly &mdash; the earliest comics depict Superman able to leap an eighth of a mile at a time. In ''Superman'' (Vol. 1) #61 (1949), Superman finally learns of the existence of Krypton. During the 1940s, Superman also becomes an honorary member of the [[Justice Society of America]], although he is only shown participating in two cases in the original Golden Age stories (''[[All-Star Comics]]'' #8 and #36).

Beginning in the 1940s Superman's life as a boy is gradually fleshed out. The first [[Superboy]] story appears in ''[[More Fun Comics]]'' #101 (February, 1945). In the story the locale is still not clearly spelled out, although it appears to be a Metropolis neighborhood, and the Kents still do not have names. Superboy isn't established as living in [[Smallville]] until ''Superboy'' (Vol. 1) #2 (May, 1949) and his parents names, [[Jonathan Kent|Jonathan]] and [[Martha Kent]], aren't given until ''Superboy'' (Vol. 1) #12 in January 1951, twelve years after his debut in ''Action Comics'' #1.

Other developments in the Superman mythos appear because of appearances in other media, including radio and newspaper strips. ''The Daily Star'' becomes ''The Daily Planet'' &mdash; possibly because newspapers called ''The Daily Star'' already existed &mdash; and [[Perry White]] replaces original editor George Taylor in the first episode of the radio serial; an office boy named [[Jimmy Olsen]] joins the cast soon afterward.

===Silver Age version===
During the [[1940s]] and [[1950s]], the Superman mythos gradually adds familiar elements, and they become firmly established by the late 1950s. This includes a greater emphasis on the science fiction elements of Superman's world, including his Kryptonian origins, as well as an updated version of his origin story.

In the version that became extant by the early 1960s (and memorably summarized at the start of each episode of the 1950s ''Adventures of Superman'' television series<ref>Narrator Bill Kennedy intoned at the start of each program: "Faster than a speeding bullet. More powerful than a locomotive. Able to leap tall buildings in a single bound. Look! Up in the sky. It's a bird. It's a plane. It's Superman! Yes, it's Superman &mdash; strange visitor from another planet who came to Earth with powers and abilities far beyond those of mortal men. Superman &mdash; who can change the course of mighty rivers, bend steel with his bare hands, and who, disguised as Clark Kent, mild-mannered reporter for a great metropolitan newspaper, fights a neverending battle for Truth, Justice, and the American Way."</ref>), Superman is born on Krypton as Kal-El, the son of [[Jor-El]], a scientist and leader, and [[Lara Lor-Van|Lara]]. When Kal-El is two or three years old, Jor-El learns that Krypton is doomed to explode. He brings this warning to the Science Council, Krypton's rulers. The Science Council refuse to warn their fellow Kryptonians and forbid Jor-El to do so. Jor-El immediately begins work on a rocket that will allow the whole family to escape the coming disaster; however, events move too quickly, and only a small model is completed by the time of the final quakes. Lara stays by her husband's side rather than accompany Kal-El to Earth so that his ship will have a better chance of surviving the trip. Knowing that Earth's lower gravity and yellow sun will give the boy extraordinary powers, Jor-El launches Kal-El's rocketship toward Earth moments before Krypton explodes.

Kal-El's ship lands in a field near the town of [[Smallville]] and is discovered by Jonathan and Martha Kent. They name him [[Superman#Clark Kent|Clark]] after Martha's maiden name. After formally adopting him, the Kents raise him. Clark and the Kents discover Clark's amazing powers, and, realizing the good he could do with his powers, the Kents train their adopted son to use his powers wisely. At the age of eight, Clark adopts the superhero identity "[[Superboy]]" and fights crime, both in the present and in the far future as a member of the [[Legion of Super-Heroes]]. After his graduation from high school and the death of the Kents, Clark moves to [[Metropolis (comics)|Metropolis]] to attend Metropolis University. During his junior year, Clark changes his superhero name to Superman. After graduating with a degree in journalism, Clark is hired by ''The Daily Planet''.

In 1971, the Galaxy Broadcasting System and its president, [[Morgan Edge]], purchase ''The Daily Planet'', Edge subsequently naming Clark Kent as the lead [[anchorman]] for its Metropolis television station, WGBS-TV. Later in the 1970s, childhood friend [[Lana Lang]] joins Clark in his newscasts as co-anchor.

After the establishment of DC Comics' [[Multiverse (DC Comics)|Multiverse]] in the 1960s, it is established retroactively that the Golden Age version of Superman lives on the [[Parallel universe (fiction)|parallel world]] of [[Multiverse (DC Comics)#Catalogued Earths|Earth-Two]] and is named Kal-L, while his [[Silver Age of comic books|Silver Age]] counterpart lives on [[Earth-One]] and is named Kal-El. While the Multiverse allowed for DC comics to bring Golden Age stories back into continuity, it also created problems. There had been no break in Superman stories between the Golden and Silver Ages; the character had been published in one ongoing story since his debut. Additionally, DC had dropped the name Kal-L in favor of Kal-El before the end of the Golden Age. 

A series of stories in the 1970s establish that the Earth-Two Superman [http://superman.ws/tales2/wife/?page=14 had married his version of Lois Lane] in the 1950s (''Action Comics'' #484, (1978)) and had become the editor-in-chief of the ''The Daily Star''. In the late 1970s, Kal-L discovers a Kryptonian rocket that contains his cousin Kara Zor-L. After acclimating to Earth, Kara becomes the superheroine [[Power Girl]]. Kal-L also continues to serve with the revived Justice Society; he is revealed as a founding member of the group in the team's origin story in ''[[DC Special]]'' #29. In the early 1980s, Kal-L is also shown as a member of the [[All-Star Squadron]] during World War II.

During the 1985 [[limited series]] ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'', the various parallel Earths combine into one, retroactively eliminating some Earth-Two heroes from existence. [[Kal-L]], the Earth-Two Superman, his wife [[Lois Lane#Golden Age|Lois Lane of Earth-Two]], the [[Superboy-Prime|Superboy of Earth-Prime]] and [[Alexander Luthor, Jr.]] of [[Multiverse (DC Comics)#Catalogued Earths|Earth-Three]], have no reality to call their own, and they enter a "paradise dimension" at the end of the series. This Superman isn't seen again until the limited series ''[[The Kingdom (comic)|The Kingdom]]'', in which it is revealed that he has found a means of exiting his dimension, but chooses not to do so yet.

[[DC Comics]] retired the Silver Age version of Superman in 1986 after the publication of ''Crisis on Infinite Earths''. Just before the character's revamp, the Silver Age Superman is given a sendoff in the two-part story "[[Superman: Whatever Happened to the Man of Tomorrow?|Whatever Happened to the Man of Tomorrow?]]", written by [[Alan Moore]] with art by [[Curt Swan]]. Although the new Modern Age version of Superman is said to have already been active for many years, most previous Superman appearances and elements are rendered out of continuity by [[John Byrne]]'s ''Man of Steel''. Later stories such as ''Superman: Birthright'' bring many of the Silver Age elements back into continuity.

===Modern Age version===
==== Man of Steel ====
[[Image:Mansteel1.png|thumb|175px|Cover to ''The Man of Steel'' #1 (July 1986). Pencils by [[John Byrne]].]]
In 1986, after the ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'' [[limited series]], DC Comics hired writer/artist [[John Byrne]] to re-create the Superman character, reshaping the previous 48 years of stories by putting new twists on the established mythos. In Byrne's re-introductory miniseries ''[[The Man of Steel (comic book)|The Man of Steel]]'', Superman, like all post-Crisis Kryptonians, is created through [[In vitro fertilization|in-vitro fertilization]] on [[Krypton (planet)|Krypton]]. While still a [[fetus]], he escapes Krypton's destruction in a spacecraft (his "birthing matrix" with a rocket engine attached), and lands more than 50 years later on Earth, just outside of [[Smallville]], Kansas. This Superman is effectively born on Earth and is as much a son of Earth as of Krypton. As in the original version, the Kents find and adopt him and raise him like a normal human. In Byrne's retelling, Clark's powers develop gradually, beginning with his invulnerability, and he doesn't fly until he is a teenager. After leaving Smallville, he travels the world before settling in Metropolis, completing his education, and going to work at ''The Daily Planet''. Although he spends years helping people and averting disasters in secret during his travels, Clark does not become Superman until just before starting work at ''The Daily Planet'', when he prevents an experimental spacecraft from crashing in Metropolis. The Kents remain alive.

The post-Crisis comics present Clark Kent as the "real" person, with Superman as the [[secret identity]] that he uses to prevent his enemies from harming his family and friends. People do not suspect that Superman is hiding his real identity because he wears no mask. The concept that Clark is the real man, as well as the greater emphasis on his Earthly upbringing, is a deliberate reversal of the pre-Crisis version. Another significant aspect of Superman's reinvention is a reduced level of abilities, with powers such as time travel removed completely and other powers &mdash; notably his invulnerability and super-strength &mdash; vastly reduced. The series also introduces the idea that Superman's invulnerability stems from his body's creating an "energy field" when exposed to solar radiation from the Earth's yellow sun.

''Man of Steel'' #3 depicts the first meeting between Superman and [[Batman]]. Superman attempts to take Batman into custody but realizes that Batman operates outside the law. Other post-Crisis comics show that the relationship between the two is a trusting one, despite the unease each feels due to the differences in their methods: Superman relies on trust and strength to achieve his goals in cooperation with the law, while Batman relies on violence and fear and operates outside the law.

''Man of Steel'' also reduces the emphasis on Superman's Kryptonian heritage. Previous comic books depicted a Superman not only aware of his heritage, but also versed in its language, culture, and other elements. In ''Man of Steel'' #6, Superman first learns of his Kryptonian heritage as an adult when his birthing matrix generates a memory implant. While such Kryptonian technology is able to help bolster his knowledge, the revamped Superman is no longer a completely Kryptonian-educated man.

As in the original continuity, Lois Lane is Clark Kent/Superman's love interest. In the early 1990s, Lois and Clark fall in love. Clark soon tells her that he is Superman, which causes a brief strain on their relationship. They eventually marry in the mid-'90s special ''Superman: The Wedding Album''.

[[Image:Deathofsuperman.jpg|thumb|160px|Art from ''Superman'' #75 (January 1993), where Superman dies in [[Lois Lane]]'s arms. Pencils by [[Dan Jurgens]].]]
In 1992, [[DC Comics]] published the storyline "[[The Death of Superman]]", in which Superman fights a character called [[Doomsday (comics)|Doomsday]]. Both Superman and Doomsday are killed, taking each other down with their final blows. "The Death of Superman" is followed by "Funeral for a Friend", which chronicles Superman's funeral and examines other characters' reactions to the death of the hero. Next, DC published the "Reign of the Supermen" storyline, during which four different characters &mdash; a new [[Superboy (Kon-El)|Superboy]], the cyborg "[[Hank Henshaw|Man of Tomorrow]]", the murderous "[[Eradicator (comics)|Last Son of Krypton]]", and [[Steel (comics)|Steel]] &mdash; are introduced as Superman, although none of them are. A de-powered Kal-El later surfaces in a Kryptonian battle suit near the end of "Reign of the Supermen". He wears a black costume with a silver 'S' shield and long hair. The cyborg allies with [[Mongul]] and destroys [[Coast City]]. Superman, Superboy, [[Matrix (comics)|Supergirl]], Steel, [[Hal Jordan]], and the Eradicator attack the "Engine City" built on top of Coast City, and the united Supermen defeat the cyborg.

==== Birthright ====
[[Image:Birthright01cover.jpg|thumb|left|The cover to the first issue of ''[[Superman: Birthright]]''.]]
In 2004, DC published an updated version of Superman's origin in the 12-issue [[limited series]] ''[[Superman: Birthright|Birthright]]''. Written by [[Mark Waid]], the limited series restores some of the pre-Crisis elements eliminated by John Byrne, including an emphasis on alien heritage. The series was planned as an origin story meant to reconcile material published between ''Man Of Steel'' and ''Birthright''. It introduces elements from Superman adaptations such as ''[[Superman: The Animated Series]]'' and the ''[[Smallville (TV series)|Smallville]]'' television series and brings several Silver Age and some Golden Age concepts back into continuity. Unlike the previous ''Man of Steel'' origin, ''Birthright'' doesn't eliminate most of the previous Superman stories told, even making reference to ''Man of Steel'' itself.

In ''Birthright'', the "birthing matrix" is replaced by the more well-known rocket ship, with Kal-El leaving Krypton as an infant rather than a fetus. Clark Kent now possesses the ability to see a living being's "aura," Superman's identity has more facets than just Clark vs. Superman, instead his identities represent different aspects of his personality. "Smallville Clark" is the "true" Clark Kent, the one most comfortable with who he is and who he is with his parents. "Metropolis Clark" is quiet, fairly isolated and shy, blending into the background and not drawing attention to himself. He often finds himself being the odd man out. "Superman" is also quiet, but rather than being seemingly harmless like Clark, he is a force to be reckoned with, tearing robot assault helicopters from the sky and dropping a drug lord's private yacht into his pool.

{{spoiler}}
In the ''[[Infinite Crisis]]'' [[limited series]], the Earth-Two Superman ([[Kal-L]]) escapes from the [[Kal-L#The "paradise" dimension|the "paradise" dimension]] with [[Alexander Luthor, Jr.]] and [[Superboy-Prime]]. He wants to recreate the universe, which he believes is corrupt, making aspects of Earth-Two predominant, rather than those of Earth-One. He believes this will also save the dying Lois Lane, but she revives briefly before collapsing and dying. In grief, Kal-L lashes out at the Earth-One Superman, and the two fight until [[Wonder Woman]] arrives and ends their battle. The two Supermen team up to confront Luthor and Superboy-Prime, whose plan to restore the [[Multiverse (DC Comics)|Multiverse]] will kill billions of people. The pair willingly deplete their powers as they drag Superboy-Prime into [[Rao]], Krypton's red sun, and use the last of their strength to defeat him on [[Mogo]], the sentient Green Lantern planet. Kal-L, fatally wounded in the battle, dies in his cousin [[Power Girl]]'s arms. He and Lois are buried next to the dead [[Superboy]] [[Conner Kent]].

''Infinite Crisis Secret Files & Origins 2006'' shows that [[Superboy-Prime]] is to blame for many continuity errors in the [[DC Universe]]. In his attempt to escape reality, his assault on the barrier wall of the paradise dimension alters history, causing [[Retcon|revisions]] of events to occur, including the ''Birthright'' origin. Alexander Luthor Jr.'s attempts to manipulate the Multiverse result in [[DC Multiverse#Catalogued Earths|New Earth]], affecting Superman's history further. Alexander indicates that Superman's early years are once more similar to the Silver Age and ''Birthright'' origins.

During the publication of the ''Infinite Crisis'' limited series, the majority of DC Comics's superhero line advanced one year. [[One Year Later|One year later]], Superman remains powerless, and [[Supergirl]] defends Metropolis. Unburdened by his responsibility to the world, Clark Kent has re-solidified his reputation as a star reporter. Lex Luthor's reputation is damaged irreparably, partially due to Clark's writing., and his fortune and power dwindle. Under attack, Clark's powers gradually return, and he returns to action. He finds that his sensory powers are enhanced, as are his computational ability and memory.

==Clark Kent==
{{main|Clark Kent}}
Clark Kent is the [[secret identity]] of Superman. Kent, as opposed to Superman, is traditionally presented as behaving in a more introverted or mild manner compared to his superheroic self. [[John Byrne]]'s ''The Man of Steel'' revamp drops many traditional aspects of Clark Kent in favor of giving him a more aggressive and extroverted personality, including making Kent a top [[American football|football]] player in high school and a successful author. Recent storylines restore elements of the earlier mild-mannered version of Kent.

Clark Kent is a reporter at the Metropolis newspaper ''The Daily Planet'', which allows him to keep track of events in which he might be able to help. Fellow reporter [[Lois Lane]] is often the object of Clark's affection; Lois's affection for Superman and rejection of Clark are a recurring theme in Superman comics, television, and movies. Unlike [[Batman]], Superman considers himself Clark Kent first and Superman second. In an episode of ''[[Lois & Clark: The New Adventures of Superman]]'' Superman says, "Superman is what I can do; ''Clark'' is who I am." 

Clark keeps his Superman identity a secret to protect his loved ones. Various methods for keeping his Superman's identity secret over the years include his using "super-hypnosis", subliminally causing people to not make the connection, compressing his spine as Clark Kent to become shorter, and studying the [[Meisner technique|Meisner acting technique]] to switch seamlessly between personas. Modern comic book stories show that to everyone, Superman is the greatest hero in the world and a larger-than-life figure, and no one thinks to look for him living as a normal human. Furthermore, since Superman goes into public unmasked, most people assume that he has no other identity. Even [[Batman]] commended him on his disguise. As long as he does not let on that he has another life, there is no real reason to look for a secret identity. When first confronted by evidence that Clark Kent is Superman, Lex Luthor dismisses it, saying, "No one with the power of Superman would be living as a normal man".

==Personality and character==
In the Golden-Age stories, Superman's personality is rough and destructive. Although nowhere near as cold-blooded as the early [[Batman]], the Superman featured in the comics of the 1930s and 1940s is not squeamish about tossing evildoers around in such a manner that fatalities are occasionally hard to avoid.

By the end of 1940, however, editor Whitney Ellsworth instituted a code of conduct for his characters to follow, and the writers moved toward Superman's better known "[[Scouting|Boy Scout]]" persona. Even so, Superman's capacity for anger is a key element in many of his most dramatic moments, allowing readers to see that Superman's goodness is not inherent. His adoptive human parents the Kents imbue him with a strong sense of purpose, morality, selflessness, modesty, fairness, compassion, and hope. Superman was raised to believe that his abilities are gifts, and are not to be abused. In many ways, he is the perfect hero, as he embodies all the best traits that people would believe to see in themselves. Unlike the Golden Age Superman, this Superman dislikes killing, and promises to "never take a life". 

Recent writers have attempted to deepen Superman's persona and provide a rationale for his goodness. Superman is often depicted with a mix of idealism, restraint, fairness, and compassion for others. The ''[[Superman: Birthright|Birthright]]'' limited series attributes the compassion Superman feels for living things to his ability to see their "[[aura]]s". He also struggles with the differences between what is right and what is practical. In ''Superman/Batman'', Batman says, "In many ways Clark is the most human of us all, and when he shoots fire down from the sky, it's hard not to think of him as a god. How fortunate for us that this never occurs to him."

==Powers and abilities==
{{main|Powers, abilities and equipment of Superman}}
Superman possesses extraordinary powers, traditionally described as, "faster than a speeding bullet, more powerful than a locomotive, and able to leap tall buildings in a single bound", a phrase first used in the Superman radio serials of the 1940s and the TV series of the 1950s. Although contemporary media still reference Superman that way, the character's powers are much more vast and complex. For most of his existence, Superman's famous arsenal of powers include flight, super strength, invulnerability, super speed, vision powers (including x-ray, heat, telescopic, infra-red, and microscopic vision), super photographic memory, super hearing, and super breath, which enables him to freeze objects by blowing on them.

As originally conceived and presented in his early stories, Superman's powers were relatively limited, consisting of superhuman strength that allowed him to lift a car over his head, run at amazing speeds, and leap one-eighth of a mile; and incredibly tough skin that could be pierced by nothing less than an exploding artillery shell. Writers slowly increased his powers over time until by the Silver Age, he was effectively omnipotent. Writers found it increasingly difficult to write Superman  stories in which the character was believably challenged, so [[DC Comics]] made a series of attempts to reel the character in. The most significant attempt, [[John Byrne]]'s 1986 rewrite established several hard limits on his abilities: He barely survives a nuclear blast, and his space flights are limited by how long he can hold his breath. Superman's power levels have increased again since then, with Superman currently possessing enough strength to hurl mountains and withstand nuclear blasts with ease.

Unlike humans, Superman cannot give blood, as his skin is impenetratable. He cannot donate organs due to his alien physiology, and the question of whether or not he can father children is still in debate. It is uncertain whether Superman can go without food or drink or for how long; some writers have portrayed him as obtaining all the energy he needs from the sun, much like [[photosynthesis]]. He also does not age like humans, because, again, living under a yellow sun is said to retard the aging process within his body.

The source of Superman's powers changes subtly over the course of his history. It is originally said that Superman's abilities derive from his Kryptonian heritage, a race eons more evolved than humans. Soon it is established that Krypton's gravity had been stronger than Earth's, a situation similar to that of [[Edgar Rice Burroughs]]' [[John_Carter_of_Mars|John Carter]]. As Superman becomes increasingly godlike, the implication that all Kryptonians had possessed the same abilities became problematic for writers, making it doubtful that a race of such beings could have been wiped out by something as trifling as an exploding planet. In part to counter this, the Superman writers established that Kryptonians, whose native star had been red, only possessed [[superpower]]s under the light of a yellow sun. More recent stories have attempted to find a balance between the two explanations.

Superman is most vulnerable to [[kryptonite]], debris from Krypton transformed into radioactive material by the forces that destroyed the planet. Exposure to kryptonite radiation nullifies Superman's powers and immobilizes him with pain. Prolonged exposure can eventually kill him.  Kryptonite was first introduced to the public in 1943, as a plot device to allow the radio serial voice actor [[Bud Collyer]] to take some time off; for several shows, Superman was represented by groaning noises while he was trapped by a chunk of kryptonite.  Green kryptonite is the most commonly seen form, but writers introduced other forms over the years, such as red, gold, blue, and black, each with its own effect.  

Superman is also vulnerable to magic; however, this is not used in his stories as commonly as kryptonite, and the vulnerability has been at best hazily defined. The most common implication is that while Superman is durable, he simply recieves no special protection against it via his powers.

[[Image:Superman_Blue.jpg|thumb|right|180px|Superman in his electric blue costume, the Man of Energy (May 1997). Pencils by [[Tom Grummett]].]]

Superman's abilities have occasionally been removed or altered for dramatic reasons. In the late 1990s ''Superman'' comics, Superman loses his traditional powers and transforms into a being of [[electromagnetic]] energy. In this form Superman can phase through solid objects, see frequencies of energy, and draw power from electrical sources. In order to maintain physical cohesion in this form, he needs to wear a containment suit. During this time, he is able to transform into the corporeal form of Clark Kent, but in his human guise he has no special powers. Superman's powers also dwindle under the light of a red sun.

Recently, some authors have implied that Superman's powers can reach nearly unlimited levels, based on solar energy absorption and withdrawal of mental blocks. In "[[Our Worlds at War]]", Superman dives into the [[sun]] to gain sufficient energy to overpower Brainiac 13, who was imbued with the Imperiex Force. In ''Superman/Batman'', when [[Kara Zor-El]] claims to be more powerful than Superman, he tells her that he put personal mental blocks on his powers as he grew up to keep from losing control and causing irreparable damage, blocks that Supergirl does not have. Thus, while Supergirl can appear to be stronger, Superman just has greater self-control.

In an interview with [[Joe Casey]] on Alvaro's ComicBoards, he writes that Superman under his penmanship can re-arrange the [[Solar System]] and tear a star apart. "I've always seen Superman as this completely over-the-top, fantastic character who has *no* limits whatsoever," writes Casey. Unencumbered by mental blocks, according to Casey, "Superman is unbeatable."

{{Spoiler}}
It is also implied in the recent '[[One Year Later]]' ''Superman'' series that Superman exerts an element of subconscious control over his powers; to truly be Superman, it appears that Clark Kent must on some level ''want'' to be Superman. This was evidenced by the one-year period following '[[Infinite Crisis]]' where, having lost his powers, he lived quite happily as the unpowered Clark Kent without any desire to return to his former life (to the extent that [[Green Lantern]]'s ring, upon showing his desired form, projected him as Clark Kent, not Superman). This lasted until an ambush from [[Intergang]] operatives saw him in front of a train - and survive the crash owing to his recently returned (and, it is implied, willed) super strength. After this, he was able to subconsciously will his other skills back (including flight and super speed).

==Publication history==
{{main|History of Superman}}
The first Superman character created by [[Jerry Siegel]] and [[Joe Shuster]] was not a hero, but a villain. Their short story "The Reign of the Superman", concerning a bald-headed villain bent on dominating the world, appeared in a science fiction fanzine that Siegel published. Jerry reconceived the character in 1932 as a hero and began a six-year quest to find a publisher. Humor Magazines almost published an early version in 1933, but the company dropped their comics line before the book was finished. Frustrated, Siegel and Shuster took a job with Major Malcolm Wheeler-Nicholson's National Allied Publications<!--That is a long title. But is it correct?-->, where they created many other comic strips. With some experience under their belt, they finally positioned Superman as the lead feature in Detective Comics Inc.'s new title, ''Action Comics''.

The revised Superman first appeared in ''[[Action Comics]]'' #1, June 1938, and a [[Superman (comic strip)| newspaper strip]] started the following year. Siegel and Shuster sold the rights to the company for $130 and a contract to supply the publisher with material. The ''[[Saturday Evening Post]]'' reported in 1941 that the pair was being paid only a fraction of Detective's Superman profits. Siegel and Shuster renegotiated their deal, but bad blood lingered and Siegel eventually sued Detective in 1947 over the rights to Superboy, which he claimed was a separate creation that Detective had published without authorization. Detective immediately fired them and took their by-line off the stories, prompting a legal battle that ended in 1948, when they settled. Detective paid them for the rights to Superboy, which they had been awarded by the court, but refused to re-hire them. Following the huge financial success of ''[[Superman: The Movie]]'' in 1978 and news reports of their pauper-like existences, Warner Communications gave Siegel and Shuster lifetime pensions of $35,000 per year and health care benefits. In addition, any media production which includes the Superman character must include the credit "Superman created by Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster".<!--UPDATE-->

During a multimedia career spanning over sixty years, Superman has starred in nearly every imaginable situation, and his powers have increased to the point that he is nearly omnipotent. This poses a challenge for writers: "How does one write about a character who is nearly as powerful as [[God]]?" (Superman's Kryptonian name, "Kal-El," resembles the Hebrew words <U+05E7><U+05DC>-<U+05D0><U+05DC>, which means "voice of God.") This problem contributed to a decline in Superman's popularity during the latter half of the 1960s and the 1970s, a period during which [[Marvel Comics]] brought a new level of character development to mainstream comic books. By the early 1980s, DC Comics had decided that a major change was needed to make Superman more appealing to current audiences. Writer-artist [[John Byrne]] was asked to revamp and revise Superman's continuity with his ''The Man of Steel'' retelling of his origin. This 1986 [[Reboot (continuity)|reboot]] brought substantial changes to the character and met huge success at the time, becoming one of the top-selling books. The relaunch of ''Superman'' comic books returned the character to the mainstream, again in the forefront of DC's titles. Superman's sales declined again after Byrne left the Superman titles after almost two years, with only sporadic sales spikes since then (notably in "[[The Death of Superman]]" storyline).

==Awards==
Superman, both the character and his various comic series, have received various awards over the years. ''[[The Death of Superman#The Reign of the Supermen|The Reign of the Supermen]]'' storyline received the ''[[Comics Buyer's Guide]]'' Fan Award for Favorite Comic Book Story in 1993.

==Cultural influences==
{{main|Cultural influences on Superman}}
Some people incorrectly believe that Superman is partly based on philosopher [[Friedrich Nietzsche]]'s [[<U+00DC>bermensch]], which literally translates to "overman" but could also mean "superman." While there is no evidence of a direct corellation, there are many parallels and many later authors did derive new developments from the [[<U+00DC>bermensch]]{{citation needed}}. Because Siegal and Shuster were both Jewish it is thought that their creation was partly influenced by the Jewish legends of the [[Golem]], a mythical being created to protect and serve the persecuted Jews of 16th century [[Prague]] and later revived in popular culture in reference to their suffering at the hands of [[Nazis]] in Europe during the 1930s and 1940s. Another influence could be [[Hugo Danner]], the main character of the novel Gladiator by Philip Wylie. Danner has the same powers of the early Superman (as do many other pulp characters of the twenties and thirties). [[Doc Savage]] may be another influence; from sharing the first name of Clark to both having an arctic [[Fortress of Solitude]] and the similarity between the 'Man of Bronze' and 'Man of Steel' monikers. The Fortress of Solitude, however, was a very late addition to the Superman mythology, and both the "Man of Steel" and "Man of Bronze" nicknames were probably influenced by Howard Pyle's novel "Men of Iron". However, the sources sited by Jerry Siegel himself were Edgar Rice Burroughs' John Carter of Mars and Tarzan, Johnston McCulley's Zorro and E.C. Seegar's Popeye.  He also appears to have been influenced by [[Jack Williamson]]'s "The Girl From Mars."

==Characters==
===Supporting characters===
{{main|Supporting characters of Superman}}
''[[Lois Lane]]'' is perhaps the character most commonly associated with Superman, as his colleague, love interest, and now wife to Clark Kent. The [[Clark and Lois]] relationship has generated numerous adventures and speculation, with DC releasing a special wedding album at the time of their marriage, which coincided with the marriage of the characters in both the comics and the television series ''[[Lois and Clark: The New Adventures of Superman]]''.

Main supporting characters include ''Daily Planet'' coworkers photographer [[Jimmy Olsen]] and Editor [[Perry White]]; Clark Kent's adopted parents [[Jonathan Kent|Jonathan]] and [[Martha Kent]]; childhood sweetheart [[Lana Lang]] and best friend [[Pete Ross]]; and former college love interest [[Lori Lemaris]], a [[mermaid]]. Incarnations of [[Supergirl]], [[Krypto|Krypto the Superdog]], and [[Superboy]] have also been major characters in the mythos, as well as the [[Justice League|Justice League of America]] (of which Superman is usually a member).

Team-ups with fellow comic icon [[Batman]] are a fan-favorite, having inspired many a story over the years. When paired, they are often affectionately referred to as the 'World's Finest' in a nod to the name of their inital team book.

Minor supporting characters over the years have included Superman's technologial aid and eccentric inventors [[Professor Hamilton|Professor Emil Hamilton]] and [[Professor Potter|Professor Phineas Potter]], Metropolis police officers [[Inspector Henderson|Inspector William Henderson]], [[Maggie Sawyer]] and [[Dan Turpin]], and former sailor-turned-bartender [[Bibbo Bibbowski]].

===Villains===
{{main|Enemies of Superman}}
[[Image:sfoes.gif|thumb|175|A gathering of many of Superman's foes]]

Superman also has a [[rogues gallery]] of [[supervillain]] enemies, including his most well-known enemy, ''[[Lex Luthor]]'', who has been envisioned over the years in various forms as either a [[mad scientist|rogue scientific genius]] with a personal vendetta against Superman, or a powerful but corrupt [[CEO]] of a conglomerate called [[LexCorp]].

The alien [[android]] (in most incarnations) known as [[Brainiac (comics)|Brainiac]] is considered by some as the second worst nemesis of Superman. The enemy that accomplished the most, by actually killing Superman, is the raging monster [[Doomsday (comics)|Doomsday]]. [[Darkseid]], one of the most powerful beings in the DC universe, is also a formidable nemesis.

Other enemies of note include the demon Satanus, the fifth-dimensional imp [[Mr. Mxyzptlk]], the [[Ultra-Humanite]], the imperfect Superman clone [[Bizarro]], criminal cyborg [[Metallo]], Kryptonian criminal [[General Zod]] (and other Kryptonians imprisoned in the [[Phantom Zone]]), the [[Parasite (comics)|Parasite]], the [[Prankster]], [[Terra-Man]], the [[Toyman]], [[Gog (comics)|Gog]], and the Metropolis [[gang]] known as [[Intergang]] (which includes mad scientists such as [[Dabney Donovan]] and Dr. Killgrave).

==Superman in popular culture==
{{main|Superman in popular culture}}
In addition to comic books, Superman has made the transition to [[radio]], [[television]],[[ movies]], [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] and [[Computer and video games|video games]] each on multiple occasions. Among the actors who have played the role are [[Kirk Alyn]] (1948 15-episode [[serial]]), [[Bob Holiday]] (''[[It's a Bird...It's a Plane...It's Superman]],'' a Broadway musical), [[Tim Daly]] (''[[Superman: The Animated Series]]''), [[George Newbern]] (''Justice League''), [[George Reeves]] (''[[The Adventures of Superman]]'' TV show), [[Christopher Reeve]] (the 1970s<U+2013>1980s ''Superman'' films), [[John Haymes Newton]], [[Gerard Christopher]] (Both of the ''Superboy'' TV shows of the 80's), [[Dean Cain]] (''[[Lois and Clark: The New Adventures of Superman]]''), [[Tom Welling]] (''[[Smallville (TV series)|Smallville]]''), and [[Brandon Routh]] (''[[Superman Returns]]''). There have also been numerous [[animation|animated]] cartoon series starring the Man of Steel.

Superman has also long been a popular subject for [[music]], inspiring songs by artists ranging from [[The Kinks]] to [[Barbra Streisand]], including [[Eminem]], [[Stereophonics]], [[Our Lady Peace]], [[Spin Doctors]], [[Crash Test Dummies]], [[Five For Fighting]], [[The Flaming Lips]], [[3 Doors Down]], [[Frank Black]], [[Sufjan Stevens]], [[Bush]], [[Laurie Anderson]], Lazlo Bane, [[Dave Matthews]], [[The Clique (band)|The Clique]], [[Donovan]], and [[Robyn Hitchcock]].  

[[Image:Seinfeld_superman.jpg|300px|thumb|Seinfeld and Superman in "[[The Adventures of Seinfeld and Superman]]."]]
Comedian [[Jerry Seinfeld]] is known to be a very big Superman fan. In many episodes of [[Seinfeld]] there are many references to Superman in addition to various memorabilia placed in Seinfeld's apartment. Seinfeld later appeared alongside an animated Superman(who was voiced by [[Patrick Warburton]] of Seinfeld fame) in a series of [[American Express]] commercials entitled "[[The Adventures of Seinfeld and Superman]]."

In addition to popular music, the Superman character has made his way into classical music. Superman is the inspiration for composer [[Michael Daugherty]]'s ''Metropolis Symphony''.  This symphony is in five movements, which are:
# "Lex"
# "Krypton"
# "Mxyzptlk"
# "Oh Lois!"
# "Red Cape Tango"
The 5th movement, "Red Cape Tango", is inspired by Superman's fight to the death with Doomsday. Also, Superman villain Bizarro inspired a jazzy Michael Daugherty piece of music of the same name.

==Notes==
<div class="references-small">
<references />
<!-- Dead note "Clark": The use of the name 'Clark' came from actor [[Clark Gable]] while 'Kent' was borrowed from [[Kent Taylor]]. -->
<!-- Dead note "Wonder Woman": The prospect of Superman and [[Wonder Woman]] (who often addresses him by his Kryptonian name of Kal-El rather than by his Earth name of Clark Kent or even his alias Superman) as a couple has been an ongoing debate among fans, given their status as two of DC's three most iconic characters (the other being [[Batman]]). In the John Byrne revamp of Superman, Superman felt a very strong attraction to Wonder Woman, even to the point of dreaming and fantasizing about her. While Superman initially thought romance would never be a part of his life due to his crime fighting, he thought for a time that his subconscious was telling him that Wonder Woman was the closest match he would ever find in a potential romantic partner. There have also been hints over the years that Wonder Woman herself is attracted to Superman. In the [[Kingdom Come (comic)|Kingdom Come]] storyline, Superman and Wonder Woman became a couple and were expecting a child together. -->
# According to official DC facts, Superman stands 6 foot 3 inches and weighs 225 pounds. His given age varies over the decades: During the 1970s and 1980s, his age in most stories is 29, while the timeline given in ''[[Zero Hour (comics)|Zero Hour]]'' #0 and most stories written since then increase his age to 35.
#According to [[Superman Returns]] prequels comic books, specifically prequel #4, Superman's height and weight are now 6'4" and 225, mainly to coincide with the other Superman movies. 
# According to the interview by [[Lois Lane]] in ''[[Superman: The Movie]]'', Superman is 6'4", 225lbs, has black hair, blue eyes, "and tells the truth." Later, [[Lex Luthor]] (portrayed by [[Gene Hackman]]) states (as he read in the interview) that Superman was born sometime in the 1950s. Clark finds the green "memory crystal" when he is 18 and spends 12 years in the Fortress of Solitude in a hibernation state, during his mental training for his career as Superman, making him about 30 years old, just the correct age for the movie, which premiered in 1978.
#In the television show ''[[Lois & Clark: The New Adventures of Superman]]'', Superman's ship crashes into Earth in 1966. This date is revealed as February 28th, 1966 by Clark Kent in the episode "Never on a Sunday" as an illusionist tries to guess his birthdate.
#Superman appears in about two-thirds of the episodes of the TV [[sitcom]] ''[[Seinfeld]]'' in some form, such as a toy or a verbal reference.{{fact}}
