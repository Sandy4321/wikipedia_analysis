==Early life==
K<U+00E4>hler was the son of Joachim Christian Herman K<U+00E4>hler (1808-1884) from the [[Duchy of Holstein]] who established a pottery workshop in N<U+00E6>stved in 1839. Herman attended the Technical School in Copenhagen (1864<U+2013>65) while studying privately under [[Herman Wilhelm Bissen]]. Thereafter he travelled to Germany, Switzerland and Paris, returning to N<U+00E6>stved at the end of 1867.<ref name=dbl/>

Together with his younger brother Carl Frederik K<U+00E4>hler, he took over the running of the factory in 1872.<ref name=ceramicstoday>{{cite web|url=http://www.ceramicstoday.com/articles/danish_ceramics7.htm|title=Danish Ceramics VII - The Turn of the Century|author=Tove Jespersen|publisher=Ceramics Today|accessdate=25 October 2014 |language=}}</ref> Carl became responsible for producing faiance while Herman specialized in manufacturing tiled stoves. In 1875, after Carl withdrew, Herman built a new factory on the town's outskirts where he produced both stoves and pottery.<ref name=dbl>{{cite web|url=http://www.denstoredanske.dk/index.php?title=Dansk_Biografisk_Leksikon/Handel_og_industri/Fabrikant/Herman_A._K%C3%A4hler|title=Herman A.

As a result of his collaboration with the artist [[Vilhelm Klein]], K<U+00E4>hler became interested in obtaining the red lustre glaze known as [[maiolica]] which had been produced in [[Gubbio]], Italy, in the 16th century. In 1888 he succeeded, developing the now famous ruby glaze known as K<U+00E4>hler red.<ref name=ceramicstoday/> The designer [[Karl Hansen Reistrup]] (1863<U+2013>1929) soon joined the enterprise, assisting in the production of finely formed, artistically decorated items, especially vases.<ref name=dbl/> Thanks to Reistrup's designs, K<U+00E4>hler's ceramics achieved considerable success both at the [[Nordic Exhibition of 1888|Great Nordic Exhibition]] held in Copenhagen in 1888 and at the [[Exposition Universelle (1889)|Exposition Universelle]] held the following year in Paris.<ref name="Campbell2006"/> A number of other artists began to design items for the K<U+00E4>hler factory, including [[Thorvald Bindesb<U+00F8>ll]], [[H. A. Brendekilde]], [[L.A. Ring]] and [[Svend Hammersh<U+00F8>i]]. Their contributions further enhanced the firm's international success.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.denstoredanske.dk/index.php?title=Kunst_og_kultur/Kunsth%C3%A5ndv%C3%A6rk_og_design/Kunsth%C3%A5ndv%C3%A6rk_i_Danmark_efter_1850/Herman_August_K%C3%A4hler|title=Herman A.

K<U+00E4>hler died in N<U+00E6>stved in 1917. His son Herman Hans Christian K<U+00E4>hler (1876-1940) who had taken over management of the factory in 1901 continued to run the enterprise.<ref name=ceramicstoday/>
