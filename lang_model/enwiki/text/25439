The '''Norman Cob''' or '''Cob Normand''' is a [[horse breed|breed]] of light [[draft horse]] that originated in the province of [[Normandy]] in northern France. It is a mid-sized horse, with a range of heights and weights, due to [[selective breeding]] for a wide range of uses. Its [[equine conformation|conformation]] is similar to a robust [[Thoroughbred]], and it more closely resembles a Thoroughbred cross than other French draft breeds. The breed is known for its lively, long-striding [[trot (horse gait)|trot]]. [[Equine coat color|Colors]] accepted by the [[breed registry]] include [[chestnut (coat)|chestnut]], [[bay (horse)|bay]] and [[seal brown (horse)|seal brown]]. There are three general subsets within the breed: horses used under saddle, those used in harness, and those destined for [[horse meat|meat production]]. They are popular for recreational and competitive [[driving (horse)|driving]], representing France internationally in the latter, and are also used for several [[equestrianism|riding]] disciplines.

The Normandy region of France is well known for its [[horse breeding]], having also produced the [[Percheron horse|Percheron]] and [[French Trotter]]. Small horses called ''bidets'' were the original horses in the area, and these, crossed with other types, eventually produced the ''Carrossier Normand'', the immediate ancestor of the Norman Cob. Although known as one of the best [[heavy warmblood|carriage horse]] breeds available in the early 20th century, the ''Carrossier Normand'' became extinct after the advent of the automobile, having been used to develop the French Trotter, [[Anglo-Norman_horse|Anglo-Norman]] and Norman Cob. In its homeland, the Norman Cob was used widely for agriculture, even more so than the internationally known Percheron, and in 1950, the first [[studbook]] was created for the breed.

The advent of mechanization threatened all French draft breeds, and while many draft breeders turned their production towards the meat market, Norman Cob breeders instead crossed their horses with Thoroughbreds to contribute to the fledgling [[Selle Francais]] breed, now France's national saddle horse. This allowed the Norman Cob to remain relatively the same through the decades, while other draft breeds were growing heavier and slower due to selection for meat. Between the 1970s and 1990s, the studbook went through several changes, and in the 1980s, genetic studies were performed that showed the breed suffered from [[inbreeding]] and [[genetic drift]]. Breed enthusiasts worked to develop new selection criteria for breeding stock, and population numbers are now relatively stable. Today, Norman Cobs are mainly found in the departments of [[Manche]], [[Calvados]] and [[Orne]].

==History==
[[File:RaceNormande.jpg|thumb|right|An illustration of the ''Carrossier Normand'' from 1861]]

The Norman Cob comes from the [[Normandy]] region of France, an area known for its horse breeding. Normandy is also the home of two other breeds, the [[Percheron]] and the [[French Trotter]]. Both of these breeds are better-known than the Norman Cob, although the latter is popular in its home region.<ref name=Ed108>Edwards, 2006, p. 108</ref> The name "cob" comes from the English and Welsh [[Cob (horse)|cobs]] that it resembles, with the addition of "Norman" to refer to the area in which it originated.<ref name=Ed108/><ref>Deschamps and Cernetic, 2004, p. 8</ref> Although generally considered a member of the [[draft horse]] group, the Norman Cob is special among French draft breeds. It has been used almost exclusively for the production of [[sport horse]]s, and has not been extensively used for the production of meat, unlike many other French draft breeds. This means that its conformation has remained relatively unchanged, as opposed to being bred for heavier weights for butchering.<ref name=Bat151>Bataille, 2008, p. 151</ref>

The original horses in Normandy and [[Brittany]] were small horses called ''bidets'', introduced by the [[Celt]]s. The Romans crossed these horses with larger [[mare]]s, and beginning in the 10th century, these "Norman horses" were desired throughout Europe. During the 16th century, Norman horses were known to be heavy and strong, able to pull long distances, and used to pull artillery and [[diligence (vehicle)|diligences]]. [[Barb horse|Barb]] and [[Arabian horse|Arabian]] blood was added during the reign of [[Louis XIV]].<ref name=Dal>{{cite book | language=French |author=Dal'Secco, Emmanuelle |title=Les chevaux de trait |publisher=Editions Artemis |year=2006 |isbn=978-2-84416-459-9| url=http://books.google.fr/books?id=KER0CJVjNocC&pg=PA32&dq=Cheval+Trait+du+Nord|page=23}}</ref><ref name="FCECHEVAL">{{cite book|author=Auzias, Dominique; Michelot, Caroline; Labourdette, Jean-Paul and Cohen, Delphine|title=La France <U+00E0> cheval|language=French|publisher=Petit Fut<U+00E9>|year=2010|isbn=978-2-7469-2782-7|page= 161|url=http://books.google.fr/books?id=RJj1f6t1mEsC&pg=PA191}}</ref><ref name=Col114>Collective, 2002, p. 114</ref> The Norman Cob is descended from this Norman horse, called the ''Carrossier Normand''.

The ''[[Haras National de Saint-L<U+00F4>]]'' (National Stud of [[Saint-Lo]]) was founded in 1806 by [[Napoleon]]. This stud and the ''[[Haras du Pin]]'' (Stud of [[Le Pin-au-Haras|Pin]]) became the main production centers for the ''Carrossier Normand''. The Norman horse-Thoroughbred crossbreds produced at these studs were divided into two groups. The first were lighter cavalry horses, and the second were heavier horses, called "cobs",<ref name=Ed108/> used for draft work in the region.<ref name="Cegarra">{{cite book |language=French| author = Cegarra, Marie | title = L'animal invent<U+00E9>: ethnographie d'un bestiaire familier | publisher = L'Harmattan | year = 1999 | page = 89| isbn = 978-2-7384-8134-4|url=http://books.google.fr/books?id=pu4PDQjvpXIC&lpg=PA89}}</ref> At this time, there was no [[breed registry]] or [[studbook]]; instead, selective breeding was practiced by the two studs, and farmers tested the capabilities of young horses to select breeding stock.<ref name=Ed108/>

===Early 20th century===
At the very beginning of the 20th century, the ''Carrossier Normand'' was considered the best carriage horses available.<ref name=Dal/> The arrival of automobiles, and corresponding decline in demand for carriage horses, coincided with a split in the breed. A distinction was made between the lighter, faster horses in the breed, used for sport, and larger horses, used for agricultural work. The lighter horses eventually became the French Trotter (for driving) and [[Anglo-Norman]] (for riding and cavalry), while the heavier horses became the Norman Cob.<ref name=Bat152/> In 1912, when French horse populations were at their highest, there were 422 stallions at the Saint-Lo stud, mainly cobs and trotters.<ref name=Ed108/> When the original ''Carrossier Normand'' became extinct in the 1920s, breeding focused on the two remaining types,<ref name=Col115>Collective, 2002, p. 115</ref> with the Norman Cob continuing to be used for farming and the Anglo-Norman being used to create the Selle Francais, the national French sport horse.<ref name=Bat152/>

[[File:Hecart ninon 01.JPG|thumb|right|A Selle Francais in competition in 2010]]
In the regions of Saint-Lo and [[Cotentin]], the Norman Cob was widespread in agricultural uses until 1950, and the population continued to increase in the first half of the 20th century, even through the [[Occupation of France|occupation during World War II]].<ref name=histoire/> Even the Percheron, which was internationally recognized as the Norman draft horse, was not as popular in the homeland of the Norman Cob breed.<ref name=Dr39>{{cite book|language=French|author=Draper, Judith|title=Le grand guide du cheval : les races, les aptitudes, les soins|publisher=<U+00C9>ditions de Bor<U+00E9>e|year=2006|isbn=978-2-84494-420-7|url=http://books.google.fr/books?id=MrI-TBgViDAC|page=39}}</ref> In 1945, Norman Cob [[stallion]]s accounted for 40% of the [[conscription|conscripted]] horses,<ref name=histoire/> and in 1950 a studbook was created for the breed.<ref>Mavr<U+00E9>, 2004, p. 44</ref>

Like all French draft breeds, the Norman Cob was threatened by the advent of mechanization in farming.<ref name=Bat153/> The only option left to many breeders was to redirect their production to the meat markets. However, the Norman Cob avoided this, through the efforts of Laurens St. Martin, the head of the Saint-Lo stud in 1944 and the developer of the Selle Francais. He began crossing Thoroughbred stallions with Norman Cob mares to produce Selle Francais horses, and the success of this program allowed a reorientation of the Cob breeding programs.<ref name=histoire/> Although population numbers continued to decline until 1995, the physical characteristics of the breed remained much the same, not growing heavier and slower as many of the French draft breeds did due to breeding for the production of meat.<ref name=Dal/><ref name=histoire/> Even today, some Selle Francais from Norman bloodlines are similar to the Norman Cob in appearance.<ref name=Bat153>Bataille, 2008, p. 153</ref>

===1950 to 2000===
The modern Norman Cob is slightly heavier than it was in the early 20th century,<ref name=Ed108/> due to lighter horses of the breed being absorbed into the Selle Francais breed.<ref>{{cite book|author=Institut du cheval|title=Maladies des chevaux: manuel pratique|language=French|publisher= France Agricole <U+00C9>ditions|year=1994|isbn=978-2-85557-010-5|page=11}}</ref> In 1976, the National Stud at Saint-Lo had 186 stallions, including 60 Norman Cobs.<ref name="FCECHEVAL"/> In the same year, the breed registry was reorganized, and the Norman Cob placed in the draft horse category.<ref name=Col114/> The reorganization of the breed registry helped to reinvigorate Norman Cob breeding,<ref name=Col115/> and to bring attention to the risk of extinction of the breed. In 1980, the ''Institut national de la recherche agronomique'' and ''Institut national agronomique'' performed demographic and genetic analysis of threatened breeds of horses within France. In 1982, researchers concluded that the Norman Cob has been [[inbreeding|inbred]] and suffered [[genetic drift]] from its original population. The increasing average age of Norman Cob breeders also made the breed's situation precarious.<ref>{{cite book|author=Audiot, Annick|title=Races d'hier pour l'<U+00E9>levage de demain: Espaces ruraux|publisher=<U+00C9>ditions Quae|year=1995|isbn=978-2-7380-0581-6|language=French|page=87}}</ref>

Enthusiasts worked to reorient the breed towards driving and recreation pursuits,<ref name=Bat153/> and since 1982 have again reorganized the breed association. In 1992, a new studbook was created for the breed,<ref>Deschamps and Cernetic, 2004, pp. 8<U+2013>9</ref> with new selection criteria designed to preserve the quality of the breed, particularly its [[horse gait|gaits]].<ref name=Bat153/> The latest editions of the breed registry and studbook are controlled by the ''Syndicat national des <U+00E9>leveurs et utilisateurs de chevaux Cob normand'' (SNEUCCN, National Union of Farmers and Users of Normandy Cob Horses), based in [[Tessy-sur-Vire]].<ref>{{cite book|language=French|author=Arn<U+00E9>, V<U+00E9>ronique and Zalkind, Jean-Marc|title=L'<U+00E9>levage du cheval|publisher=Educagri <U+00C9>ditions|year=2007|isbn=978-2-84444-443-1|page=224}}</ref> The association works to preserve and promote the breed throughout France, focusing especially on Normandy, [[Vendee]] and [[Anjou]].<ref name=syndicat>{{cite web|url=http://www.cobnormand.com/fr/association/|title=Statuts du Syndicat Cob normand|publisher=Syndicat national des <U+00E9>leveurs et utilisateurs de chevaux Cob Normand|accessdate=2013-02-11|language=French}}</ref> In 1994, Normandy contained 2000 Percheron and Norman Cob horses, and annually bred around 600 foals of these two breeds.

Today, Norman Cobs are mainly found in the departments of [[Manche]], [[Calvados]] and [[Orne]],<ref name=Bat152/><ref name=haras/> which form the area where the breed was originally developed. The region of Saint-Lo, which ranks first in the production of Norman Cobs, represents 35 percent of new births.<ref name="FCECHEVAL"/><ref name=haras/> The Norman Cob is also present around the Haras de la Vendee (Stud at Vendee), which represents 25 percent of births, the Haras du Pin and in central [[Massif]]. In 2004, there were just over 600 French breeders of the Norman Cob, and in 2005, 914 Norman Cob mares were bred, with 65 stallions recorded as active in France. In recent years, the number of Norman Cobs has remained relatively stable.<ref name=haras/> In 2011, there were 319 Norman Cob births in France, and numbers of annual births between 1992 and 2010 ranged between 385 and 585.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.haras-nationaux.fr/information/accueil-equipaedia/races-dequides/chevaux-de-trait/cob-normand.html?type=98|title=Le Cob Normand|author=Syndicat national des <U+00E9>leveurs et utilisateurs de chevaux Cob Normand|publisher=Les Haras Nationaux|accessdate=2013-02-11|language=French}}</ref>
