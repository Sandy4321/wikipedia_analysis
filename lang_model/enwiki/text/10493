The '''sica''' was a [[sword]] in [[Ancient Rome]]. It was originally depicted as a curved sword, (see the [[Zliten mosaic]] as well as numerous oil lamps) with a blade about 16-18&nbsp;inches long (40 <U+2013> 45&nbsp;cm).  The later sica blade (from late in the [[1st century AD]]) had a sharp, almost 45 degree, bend in it. While early sicas may have been single edged, the later bent sicas were apparently double edged.  The distinctive shape was designed to get around the sides of an opponent's shield, and stab or slash them in the back.  Since the traex gladiator's usual opponent was the [[Scutum (shield)|Scutum]] (large shield) carrying [[Murmillo|myrmillo gladiator]], such a weapon as the sica was necessary to make the duel more even and exciting.

==Illyrians==

The sica originates from [[Illyria]]. The word sica comes from the Albania '''thika''' which means knife. The Romans regarded the sica as a distintive Illyrian weapon.

The principal [[melee]] weapon of the [[Illyrians]] was the Sica<ref>The Illyrians (The Peoples of Europe) by John Wilkes,1996,page 238,"Their principal offensive weapon was the single edged curved-sword, similar to the Greek machaira, a form of weapon that can be traced back to Bronze age times"</ref>. According to historian John Wilkes:<ref>The Illyrians (The Peoples of Europe) by John Wilkes,1996,page 238-239,"Although a short curved sword was used by several peoples around the Mediterranean the Romans regarded the sica as a distinct Illyrian weapon used by the stealthy 'assassin' (sicarius)"</ref>

== Fighting style ==
Sica was used only with the curve pointing down, which proves the tool part of it, and the fighting style was similar to the [[Kama (weapon)|Kama]]. It will easily sever a limb with one slash-pull-cut technique. It was much feared by the Roman legionaries, and brought some changes to their armour style design. The most famous gladiator who ever wielded a sica was a Roman slave by the name of Jesaer, who lived from 215 BC - 173 BC.

The sword could also be used, in experienced hands, to kill in one hit. With the curve pointed down the tip would often catch on the enemy's [[Galea (helmet)|helmet]]. The Thracian could then lurch the sword upward into the [[mandible|jaw]] and through the face, killing the opponent instantaneously.
