The '''Sikorsky H-34 Choctaw''' (company designation '''S-58''') is a piston-engined military helicopter that was originally designed by [[United States|American]] aircraft manufacturer [[Sikorsky Aircraft|Sikorsky]] for the [[United States Navy]] for service in the [[anti-submarine warfare]] (ASW) role. It has seen extended use when adapted to turbine power by the British licensee as the [[Westland Wessex]] and Sikorsky as the later S-58T. 

Various H-34s served, mostly as medium transports, on every continent with the armed forces of twenty-five countries&nbsp;<U+2014> from combat in Algeria, the Dominican Republic, Nicaragua, and throughout Southeast Asia, in roles from saving flood victims, recovering astronauts, fighting fires, and carrying presidents. As one of the last piston-powered helicopter designs before its replacement by turbine-powered types such as the UH-1 Huey and CH-46 Sea Knight, it would see a remarkably long run of 2,108 H-34s produced between 1953 and 1970.<ref>[http://www.uswarplanes.net/h34.html "H-34."] ''Warplanes.net.''

==Development==

[[File:CH-37C and UH-34D USMC in flight 1964.JPEG|thumb|right|CH-37C and UH-34D of the [[United States Marine Corps]].]]

The Sikorsky S-58 was developed as a lengthened and more powerful version of the Sikorsky (model S-55) or [[H-19 Chickasaw|UH-19 Chickasaw]], with a similar nose, but with a tail-dragger rear fuselage and landing gear, rather than the high-tail, 4-post pattern. It retained the nose-mounted piston engine with the drive shaft passing through the cockpit placed high above the cargo compartment. 

The aircraft first flew on 8 March 1954. The first production aircraft was ready in September and entered in service for the [[United States Navy]] initially designated '''HSS-1 Seabat''' (in its anti-submarine configuration) and '''HUS-1 Seahorse''' (in its utility transport configuration) under the U.S. Navy designation system for U.S. Navy, [[United States Marine Corps]] (USMC) and [[United States Coast Guard]] (USCG) aircraft. The U.S. Army and Marine Corps, respectively, ordered it in 1955 and 1957. Under the [[United States Army]]'s aircraft designation system, also used by the [[United States Air Force]], the helicopter was designated '''H-34'''. The U.S. Army also applied the name '''Choctaw''' to the helicopter. In 1962, under the new unified DoD aircraft designation system, the Seabat was redesignated '''SH-34''', the Seahorse as the '''UH-34''', and the Choctaw as the '''CH-34'''.

Roles included utility transport, anti-submarine warfare, search and rescue, and VIP transport. In it standard configuration transport versions could carry 12 to 16 troops, or eight [[stretcher]] cases if utilized in the [[MedEvac]] role, while VIP transports carried significantly fewer people in significantly greater comfort.

A total of 135 H-34s were built in the U.S. and assembled by [[Sud-Aviation]] in France, 166 were produced under licence in France by Sud-Aviation for the French Air Force, Navy and Army Aviation (ALAT).

The CH-34 was also built and developed under license from 1958 in the [[United Kingdom]] by [[Westland Aircraft]] as the turbine engined '''[[Westland Wessex|Wessex]]''' which was used by the [[Royal Navy]] and [[Royal Air Force]]. The RN Wessex was fitted out with weapons and ASW equipment for use in an antisubmarine role. The RAF used the Wessex, with turboshaft engines, as an air/sea rescue helicopter and as troop transporter. Wessexes were also exported to other countries and produced for civilian use.

==Operational history==
[[File:Sikorsky HUS-1G USCG at Anacostia 1960.jpg|thumb|A U.S. Coast Guard HUS-1G in 1960.]]

===Vietnam War===
French evaluations on the reported ground fire vulnerabilities of the CH-34 may have influenced the U.S. Army's decision to deploy the [[Piasecki H-21|CH-21 Shawnee]] to Vietnam instead of the CH-34, pending the introduction into widespread service of the Bell [[UH-1]] Iroquois. U.S. Army H-34s did not participate in Vietnam, and did not fly in the assault helicopter role, however a quantity were supplied to the Army of the Republic of Vietnam. These saw little use due lack of spare parts and maintenance.<ref name="Mesko">Mesko 1984, pp. 4<U+2013>6.</ref>

[[File:HUS-1s HMM-362 in flight Vietnam 1962.jpg|thumb|U.S. Marine Corps UH-34Ds over Vietnam, 1965.]]
Its higher availability and reliability due to its simplicity compared to the newer helicopters led Marines to ask for it by name. The phrases "give me a HUS", "get me a HUS" and "cut me a HUS" entered the U.S. Marine Corps vernacular, being used even after the type was no longer in use to mean "help me out".<ref name="Fails">Fails 1995, p. 9.</ref>  

USMC H-34s were also among the first gunship helicopters trialled in theatre, being fitted with the [[U.S. Helicopter Armament Subsystems#UH-34/CH-34 Choctaw/Seahorse|Temporary Kit-1 (TK-1)]], comprising two [[M60 machine gun|M60C machine guns]] and two 19-shot [[Mk 4/Mk 40 Folding-Fin Aerial Rocket|2.75 inch rocket]] pods. The operations were met with mixed enthusiasm, and the armed H-34s, known as "Stingers" were quickly phased out. The TK-1 kit would form the basis of the [[U.S. Helicopter Armament Subsystems#UH-1 Iroquois|TK-2]] kit used on the UH-1E helicopters of the USMC.

===Post-Vietnam War===
The H-34 remained in service with United States Army and Marine Corps aviation units well into the late 1960s, and was standard equipment in [[United States Marine Corps Reserve|Marine Corps Reserve]], [[United States Army Reserve|Army Reserve]] and [[Army National Guard]] aviation units until replaced by the [[UH-1 Iroquois]] utility helicopter. Sikorsky production ceased in 1968, with 1,821 built.<ref name="janes">Endres, G<U+00FC>nter G. ''Jane's Helicopter Markets and Systems''. Coulsdon, Surrey, UK: Jane's Information Group, 1996.

===France===
France bought 134 Choctaws in parts from the United States and assembled by [[Sud-Aviation]]. A further 166 were manufactured later locally for the French Army, Navy and Air force, these again produced by Sud-Aviation.<ref name="MilitaryFactory">[http://www.militaryfactory.com/aircraft/detail.asp?aircraft_id=327 "Sikorsky H-34 / CH-34 Choctaw."]''militaryfactory.com.''

===Israel===
[[File:SikorskyS58Israel.jpg|thumb|[[Israeli Air Force]] Sikorsky S-58 (1967)]]
The S-58 flew combat missions after the end of the Six Days War, mainly against Palestinians infiltrating Israel or against their bases in Jordan. On 21 March 1968, they participated in the [[Battle of Karameh]], bringing Israeli troops in and out as well as evacuating the wounded. This was the last operation of the S-58 as it was retired shortly later, replaced by the [[Bell 204/205|Bell 205]] and [[A<U+00E9>rospatiale Super Frelon]].<ref>Gunston 1982, p. 92.</ref>
