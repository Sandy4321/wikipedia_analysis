{{nihongo|'''Kyoto'''|{{linktext|<U+4EAC><U+90FD><U+5E02>}}|Ky<U+014D>to-shi}} ({{IPA-ja|k<U+02B2>o<U+02D0><U+A71C>to|-|Kyoto-shi.ogg}}) is a [[Cities of Japan|city]] located in the central part of the island of [[Honshu]], [[Japan]]. It has a population close to 1.5 million. Formerly the imperial [[capital of Japan]] for more than one thousand years, it is now the capital city of [[Kyoto Prefecture]] located in the [[Kansai region]], as well as a major part of the [[Keihanshin|Kyoto-Osaka-Kobe]] metropolitan area. One historical nickname for the city is the ''City of Ten Thousand Shrines''.

== Name ==
[[File:Meaco in map.jpg|thumb|18th century map with the Japanese capital "Meaco"]]

In Japanese, the city has been called '''Ky<U+014D>''' ({{lang|ja|<U+4EAC>}}), '''Miyako''' ({{lang|ja|<U+90FD>}}), or '''Ky<U+014D> no Miyako''' ({{lang|ja|<U+4EAC><U+306E><U+90FD>}}). In the 11th century, the city was renamed Kyoto ("capital city"), after the Chinese word for capital city, ''jingdu'' ({{lang|ja|<U+4EAC><U+90FD>}}).<ref>Lowe, John. (2000). ''Old Kyoto: A short Social History,'' p. x.</ref>  After [[Edo]] was renamed [[Tokyo]] (meaning "Eastern Capital") in 1868, Kyoto was known for a short time as '''Saiky<U+014D>''' ({{lang|ja|<U+897F><U+4EAC>}}, meaning "Western Capital").

An obsolete spelling for the city's name is '''Kioto'''; it was formerly known to the West as '''Meaco'''  ({{IPAc-en|m|i<U+02D0>|<U+00E6>|k|o<U+028A>}}; {{lang-ja|<U+90FD>}}; miyako, meaning "the seat of Imperial palace" or "capital".) Another term commonly used to refer to the city in the pre-modern period was '''Keishi''' ({{linktext|<U+4EAC><U+5E2B>}}), meaning "metropolis" or "capital".

=== Heian-ky<U+014D> ===
{{main|Heian-ky<U+014D>}}

During the 8th century, when powerful [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] clergy became involved in the affairs of the Imperial government, the [[Emperor]] chose to relocate the capital to a region far from the Buddhist influence. [[Emperor Kammu]] selected the village of Uda, at the time in the Kadono district of [[Yamashiro Province]], for this honour.<ref>Kyoto Exhibitors' Association (1910) ''Kyoto'' Kyoto Exhibitors' Association of the Japan-British exhibition, Kyoto, p. 3 [http://worldcat.org/oclc/1244391 OCLC 1244391]</ref>

The new city, '''[[Heian-ky<U+014D>]]''' ({{lang|ja|<U+5E73><U+5B89><U+4EAC>}}, "tranquility and peace capital"), a scaled replica of the then [[Tang Dynasty|Tang]] capital [[Chang'an]],<ref name="ebrey 103">{{Harvnb|Ebrey|Walthall|Palais|2006|p=103}}.</ref> became the seat of Japan's imperial court in 794, beginning the [[Heian period]] of [[History of Japan|Japanese history]]. Although military rulers established their governments either in Kyoto ([[Muromachi shogunate]]) or in other cities such as [[Kamakura, Kanagawa|Kamakura]] ([[Kamakura shogunate]]) and [[Edo]] ([[Tokugawa shogunate]]), Kyoto remained Japan's capital until the transfer of the imperial court to Tokyo in 1869 at the time of the [[Meiji Restoration|Imperial Restoration]]. (Some believe that it is still a legal capital: see [[Capital of Japan]].)

The city suffered extensive destruction in the [[<U+014C>nin War]] of 1467-1477, and did not really recover until the mid-16th century. Battles between samurai factions spilled into the streets, and came to involve the court nobility (''[[kuge]]'') and religious factions as well. Nobles' mansions were transformed into fortresses, deep trenches dug throughout the city for defense and as firebreaks, and numerous buildings burned. The city has not seen such widespread destruction since.

In the late 16th century, [[Toyotomi Hideyoshi]] restructured the city by building new streets to double the number of north-south streets in central Kyoto, creating rectangle blocks superseding ancient square blocks. Hideyoshi also built earthwork walls called {{Nihongo|Odoi|<U+5FA1><U+571F><U+5C45>}}<U+3000>encircling the city. [[Teramachi Street]] in central Kyoto is a Buddhist temple quarter where Hideyoshi gathered temples in the city. Throughout the [[Edo period]], the economy of the city flourished as one of three major cities in Japan, the others being [[Osaka]] and Edo.

The [[Kinmon Incident|Hamaguri rebellion]] of 1864 burnt down 28,000 houses in the city, and the subsequent move of the Emperor to Tokyo in 1869 weakened the economy. The modern city of Kyoto was formed on April 1, 1889. The construction of [[Lake Biwa Canal]] in 1890 is one measure taken to revive the city. The population of the city exceeded one million in 1932.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.city.kyoto.jp/sogo/toukei/guide/Faq/p_oth002.html|title=<U+60C5><U+5831><U+7D71><U+8A08><U+62C5><U+5F53><U+FF08><U+4EAC><U+90FD><U+5E02><U+306E><U+7D71><U+8A08><U+60C5><U+5831><U+FF09><U+FF0F><U+3088><U+304F><U+3042><U+308B><U+8CEA><U+554F><U+FF0F><U+4EBA><U+53E3><U+30FB><U+4E16><U+5E2F>|author=City of Kyoto|year=2003|accessdate=July 5, 2010}}</ref>

There was some consideration by the [[United States]] of targeting Kyoto with an [[Nuclear weapon|atomic bomb]] at the end of [[World War II]] because, as an intellectual center of Japan, it had a population "better able to appreciate the significance of the weapon."<ref>Wyden, Peter. (1984). ''Day One: Before Hiroshima and After'', page 196.</ref> In the end, at the insistence of [[Henry L. Stimson]], Secretary of War in the Roosevelt and Truman administrations, the city was removed from the list of targets and replaced by [[Nagasaki]]. The city was largely spared from conventional bombing as well, although small-scale air raids did result in casualties.

As a result, the Imperial City (Emeritus), of Kyoto is one of the few Japanese cities that still have an abundance of prewar buildings, such as the traditional townhouses known as ''[[machiya]]''. However, modernization is continually breaking down the traditional Kyoto in favor of newer architecture, such as the [[Ky<U+014D>to Station]] complex.

Kyoto became a [[city designated by government ordinance]] on September 1, 1956. In 1997, Kyoto hosted the conference that resulted in the [[Kyoto Protocol|protocol]] on [[greenhouse gas]] emissions that bears the city's name.

Kyoto is located in a valley, part of the Yamashiro (or Kyoto) Basin, in the eastern part of the mountainous region known as the Tamba highlands. The Yamashiro Basin is surrounded on three sides by mountains known as Higashiyama, Kitayama and Nishiyama, with a height just above {{convert|1000|m|0}} [[above mean sea level|above sea level]]. This interior positioning results in hot summers and cold winters. There are three rivers in the basin, the [[Uji River|Ujigawa]] to the south, the [[Katsura River|Katsuragawa]] to the west, and the [[Kamo River|Kamogawa]] to the east. Kyoto City takes up 17.9% of the land in the prefecture with an area of {{convert|827.9|km<U+00B2>|1|abbr=out}}.

The original city was arranged in accordance with traditional [[China|Chinese]] [[feng shui]] following the model of the ancient Chinese capital of [[Chang'an]] (present-day [[Xi'an]]). The [[Heian Palace|Imperial Palace]] faced south, resulting in Uky<U+014D> (the right sector of the capital) being on the west while Saky<U+014D> (the left sector) is on the east. The streets in the modern-day wards of [[Nakagy<U+014D>-ku, Kyoto|Nakagy<U+014D>]], [[Shimogyo-ku, Kyoto|Shimogy<U+014D>]], and [[Kamigy<U+014D>-ku]] still follow a grid pattern.

Today, the main business district is located to the south of the old [[Kyoto Imperial Palace|Imperial Palace]], with the less-populated northern area retaining a far greener feel. Surrounding areas do not follow the same grid pattern as the center of the city, though streets throughout Kyoto share the distinction of having names.

Kyoto sits atop a large natural water table that provides the city with ample freshwater wells. Due to large-scale urbanization, the amount of rain draining into the table is dwindling and wells across the area are drying at an increasing rate.

==Demographics==
Historically Kyoto was the largest city in Japan, later surpassed by Osaka and Edo (Tokyo) towards the end of the 16th century. In the prewar years, Kyoto traded places with Kobe and Nagoya ranking as the 4th and 5th largest city. In 1947, it went back to being 3rd, but its population has gradually declined ever since. By 1960 it had fallen to 5th again, and by 1990 it had fallen to 7th, in 2012 it is now 8th.  If current trends continue it could fall to 9th after Kawasaki.

==Climate==
Kyoto has a [[humid subtropical climate]] ([[K<U+00F6>ppen climate classification|K<U+00F6>ppen]] ''Cfa''), featuring a marked seasonal variation in temperature and precipitation. Summers are hot and humid, though contrarily, winters are relatively cold with occasional snowfall. Kyoto's rain season begins around the middle of June and lasts until the end of July, yielding to a hot and sunny latter half of the summer. Kyoto, along with most of the Pacific coast and central areas of Japan is prone to typhoons during September and October.

==Culture==
[[File:Tsukemono shop by Gavin Anderson in Nishiki Ichiba, Kyoto.jpg|thumb|A [[tsukemono]] shop on Nishiki Street]]

Although ravaged by wars, fires, and earthquakes during its eleven centuries as the imperial capital, Kyoto was spared from much of the destruction of World War II. It was removed from the atomic bomb target list (which it had headed) by the personal intervention of Secretary of War [[Henry L. Stimson]], as Stimson wanted to save this cultural center which he knew from his honeymoon and later diplomatic visits.<ref>[http://www.mbe.doe.gov/me70/manhattan/debate.htm The Manhattan Project, Department of Energy at mbe.doe.gov]</ref><ref>[http://www.hyperhistory.net/apwh/bios/b4stimson-henrylewis.htm HyperHistory.net  Dec. 22, 2009.

[[File:Japanese buddhist monk by Arashiyama cut.jpg|thumb|upright|left|A monk by the [[Katsura River]] in [[Arashiyama]]]]

[[File:Geisha-kyoto-2004-11-21.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Typical [[Maiko (geiko)|maiko]] dress, hair ornaments, and [[nape]] [[Cosmetics|make-up]]]]

With its 2000 religious places- 1600 [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] temples and 400 [[Shinto shrine]]s, as well as palaces, gardens and architecture intact, it is one of the best preserved cities in Japan. Among the most famous temples in Japan are [[Kiyomizu-dera]], a magnificent wooden temple supported by pillars off the slope of a mountain; [[Kinkaku-ji]], the Temple of the Golden Pavilion; [[Ginkaku-ji]], the Temple of the Silver Pavilion; and [[Ry<U+014D>an-ji]], famous for its rock garden. The [[Heian Shrine|Heian Jing<U+016B>]] is a Shinto shrine, built in 1895, celebrating the Imperial family and commemorating the first and last emperors to reside in Kyoto. Three special sites have connections to the imperial family: the Kyoto Gyoen area including the [[Kyoto Gosho|Kyoto Imperial Palace]] and [[Sento Imperial Palace]], homes of the [[List of Emperors of Japan|Emperors of Japan]] for many centuries; [[Katsura Imperial Villa]], one of the nation's finest architectural treasures; and [[Shugaku-in Imperial Villa]], one of its best [[Japanese garden]]s.  In addition, the temple of Sennyu-ji houses the tombs of the emperors from [[Emperor Shij<U+014D>|Shij<U+014D>]] to [[Emperor K<U+014D>mei|K<U+014D>mei]].

Other sites in Kyoto include [[Arashiyama]], the [[Gion]] and [[Pontoch<U+014D>]] [[geisha]] quarters, the [[Philosopher's Walk]], and the canals which line some of the older streets.

The "[[Historic Monuments of Ancient Kyoto (Kyoto, Uji and Otsu Cities)|Historic Monuments of Ancient Kyoto]]" are listed by the [[UNESCO]] as a [[World Heritage Site]]. These include the [[Kamo Shrine]]s (Kami and Shimo), [[T<U+014D>-ji|Ky<U+014D>-<U+014D>-Gokokuji]] (T<U+014D>-ji), [[Kiyomizu-dera]], [[Daigo-ji]], [[Ninna-ji]], [[Saih<U+014D>-ji (Kyoto)|Saih<U+014D>-ji]] (Kokedera), [[Tenry<U+016B>-ji]], [[Kinkaku-ji|Rokuon-ji]] (Kinkaku-ji), [[Ginkaku-ji|Jish<U+014D>-ji]] (Ginkaku-ji), [[Ry<U+014D>an-ji]], [[Hongan-ji]], [[K<U+014D>zan-ji]] and the [[Nij<U+014D> Castle]], primarily built by the [[Tokugawa shogunate|Tokugawa shoguns]]. Other sites outside the city are also on the list.

Kyoto is renowned for its abundance of delicious Japanese foods and cuisine. The special circumstances of Kyoto as a city away from the sea and home to many Buddhist temples resulted in the development of a variety of vegetables peculiar to the Kyoto area (''ky<U+014D>yasai'', {{lang|ja|<U+4EAC><U+91CE><U+83DC>}}).

Japan's television and film industry has its center in Kyoto. Many ''[[jidaigeki]]'', action films featuring samurai, were shot at Toei Uzumasa Eigamura.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pref.kyoto.jp/visitkyoto/en/theme/others/uzumasa_movie/|title=Welcome to Kyoto <U+2014> Toei Uzumasa Eigamura Movie Museum|publisher=Pref.kyoto.jp|accessdate=2010-03-07}}</ref> A film set and theme park in one, Eigamura features replicas of traditional Japanese buildings which are used for ''jidaigeki''. Among the sets are a replica of the old [[Nihonbashi]] (the bridge at the entry to [[Edo]]), a traditional courthouse, a Meiji Period [[k<U+014D>ban|police box]] and part of the former [[Yoshiwara]] red-light district. Actual film shooting takes place occasionally, and visitors are welcome to observe the action.

The [[Japanese dialects|dialect]] spoken in Kyoto is known as ''Ky<U+014D>-kotoba'' or ''Ky<U+014D>to-ben'', a constituent dialect of the [[Kansai dialect]]. When Kyoto was the capital of Japan, the Kyoto dialect was the ''de facto'' standard Japanese and influenced the development of [[Tokyo dialect]], the modern standard Japanese. Famous Kyoto expressions are a polite copula ''dosu'', an honorific verb ending ''-haru'', etc.

==Economy==
[[File:Nintendo office.jpg|thumb|The exterior of [[Nintendo]]'s main headquarters in Kyoto]]
[[File:Kyomizuzaka.JPG|thumb|Tourists on street near [[Kiyomizu-dera]]]]

The key industry of Kyoto is [[information technology]] and electronics: the city is home to the headquarters of [[Nintendo]], [[Intelligent Systems]], [[Dainippon Screen]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.screen.co.jp/eng/profile/outline.html |title=Dainippon Screen corporate profile |accessdate=March 6, 2014}}</ref> [[TOSE]], [[OMRON]], [[Kyocera]], [[Shimadzu Corp.]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.shimadzu.com/about/profile/index.html |title=Shimadzu corporate profile |accessdate=April 16, 2014}}</ref> [[Rohm]], [[Horiba]], [[Nidec|Nidec Corporation]], [[Nichicon]] and [[GS Yuasa]].

[[Tourism]] also forms a large base of Kyoto's economy. The city's cultural heritages are constantly visited by school groups from across Japan, and many foreign tourists also stop in Kyoto. In 2007, the city government announced that a record number of tourists had visited Kyoto for the sixth year in a row.,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.japannewsreview.com/society/kansai/20070706page_id=398|title=Kyoto tourism setting new record for 6th year in a row|publisher=Japan News Review|date=July 6, 2007 |accessdate=March 7, 2010}}</ref> and it was chosen as the second most attractive city in Japan, in a regional brand survey.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://en.j-cast.com/2007/08/09009922.html|title=Sapporo picked as "most attractive town" for 2nd consecutive year&nbsp;<U+2014> J-Cast|publisher=En.j-cast.com |date=July 23, 2007 |accessdate=March 7, 2010}}</ref>

[[Japanese handicrafts|Traditional Japanese crafts]] are also major industry of Kyoto, most of which are run by artisans in small plants. Kyoto's [[kimono]] weavers are particularly renowned, and the city remains the premier center of kimono manufacturing. Such businesses, vibrant in past centuries, have declined in recent years as sales of traditional goods stagnate.

[[Sake]] brewing is Kyoto's traditional industry. [[Gekkeikan]] and [[Takara Holdings]] are major sake brewers headquartered in Kyoto.

Other notable businesses headquartered in Kyoto includes [[Aiful]], [[Ishida (company)|Ishida]], [[Mk#In business|MK]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mktaxi-japan.com/ |title=MK Taxi Kyoto official site |accessdate=March 6, 2014}}</ref> [[Seven & I Holdings Co.#Subsidiaries|Nissen Holdings]], [[Gyoza no Ohsho|Oh-sho]], [[Sagawa Express]], [[Volks]] and [[Wacoal]].

The concentration of population to the capital city area is 55% which is highest among the prefectures.  The economic difference between the coastal area and inland area including Kyoto basin is significant.

====High-speed rail====
[[File:Shinkansen700 in Kyoto juli 2004.JPG|thumb|[[Shinkansen]] at Kyoto Station]]
{{Main|T<U+014D>kaid<U+014D> Shinkansen|Sany<U+014D> Shinkansen}}
{{See also|Central Japan Railway Company|West Japan Railway Company}}

The [[T<U+014D>kaid<U+014D> Shinkansen]] operated by [[JR Central]] provides high-speed rail service linking Kyoto with [[Nagoya, Aichi|Nagoya]], [[Yokohama]] and [[Tokyo]] to the east of Kyoto and with nearby [[Osaka]] and points west on the [[San'yo Shinkansen]], such as [[Kobe]], [[Okayama]], [[Hiroshima]], [[Kitakyushu]], and [[Fukuoka]]. The trip from Tokyo takes about two hours and twenty-two minutes. From [[Hakata Station|Hakata]] in Fukuoka, [[Nozomi (train)|Nozomi]] takes you to Kyoto in just over three hours. All trains including Nozomi stop at Kyoto Station, serving as a gateway to not only [[Kyoto Prefecture]] but also northeast [[Osaka Prefecture|Osaka]], south [[Shiga Prefecture|Shiga]] and north [[Nara Prefecture|Nara]].

===Airport===
{{See also|Kansai International Airport|Itami Airport}}
[[File:JR West Type 281.jpg|thumb|Kansai Airport express ''[[Haruka (train)|Haruka]]'' at Kyoto Station]]

Although Kyoto does not have its own airport, travelers can get to the city via [[Kansai International Airport]] and [[Osaka International Airport]] in [[Osaka Prefecture]]. The [[Kansai Airport Express, Haruka|Haruka Express]] operated by [[JR West]] carries passengers from Kansai Airport to [[Kyoto Station]] in 73 minutes.<ref>[http://www.westjr.co.jp/english/travel/kix/index.html JR-WEST: Travel Information > Access to Kansai Airport]</ref>

[[Osaka Airport Transport]] buses connect [[Itami Airport]] and Kyoto Station Hachijo Gate in 50 minutes and cost 1,280 yen for a one-way trip. Some buses go further, make stops at major hotels and terminals in downtown area.

===Buses===
Kyoto's [[Kyoto Municipal Transportation Bureau|municipal bus network]] is extensive. Private carriers also operate within the city. Many tourists join commuters on the public buses, or take tour buses. Kyoto's buses have announcements in English and electronic signs with stops written in the Latin alphabet.

Most city buses have a fixed fare. A one-day bus pass and a combined unlimited train and bus pass are also available. These are especially useful for visiting many different points of interest within Kyoto. The bus information center just outside the central station handles tickets and passes. The municipal transport company publishes a very useful leaflet called "Bus Navi." It contains a route map for the bus lines to most sights and fare information. This too is available at the information center in front of the main station.

Buses operating on routes within the city, the region, and the nation stop at [[Kyoto Station]]. In addition to Kyoto Station, bus transfer is available at the intersections of [[Shij<U+014D> Kawaramachi]] and {{ja-stalink|Sanj<U+014D> Keihan}}. The intersection of [[Kita<U+014D>ji Station|Karasuma Kita<U+014D>ji]] to the north of downtown has a major bus terminal serving passengers who take the [[Karasuma Line]] running beneath [[Karasuma Street]], Kyoto's main north-south street.

===Cycling===
[[Cycling]] is a very important form of personal transportation in the city. The geography and scale of the city are such that the city may be easily navigated on a bicycle. Bicycle theft is not common, but finding permitted bicycle parking areas can be difficult. Bicycles parked in non-permitted areas are impounded.

===Roads===
The city is connected with other part of Japan by the [[Meishin Expressway]], which has two interchanges in the city: Kyoto Higashi (Kyoto East) in Yamashina-ku and Kyoto Minami (Kyoto South) in Fushimi-ku. The [[Kyoto J<U+016B>kan Expressway]] connects the city to northern regions of Kyoto Prefecture. The [[Daini Keihan Road]] is a new bypass (completed in 2010) to Osaka.

Although Kyoto has fewer toll-highways than other comparable Japanese cities, it is served with dual and even triple-carriageway national roads. As of 2010, only {{convert|8.2|km|1|abbr=off}} of the [[Hanshin Expressway]] Kyoto Route is in operation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hanshin-exp.co.jp/company/technology/kakusyudata.pdf|format=pdf|title=<U+962A><U+795E><U+9AD8><U+901F><U+306E><U+5404><U+7A2E><U+30C7><U+30FC><U+30BF>|author=Hanshin Expressway|language=Japanese|accessdate=September 24, 2010}}</ref>

There are nine national highways in the city of Kyoto:
[[Route 1 (Japan)|Route 1]], [[Route 8 (Japan)|Route 8]], [[Route 9 (Japan)|Route 9]], [[Route 24 (Japan)|Route 24]], [[Route 162 (Japan)|Route 162]], [[Route 171 (Japan)|Route 171]], [[Route 367 (Japan)|Route 367]], [[Route 477 (Japan)|Route 477]] and [[Route 478 (Japan)|Route 478]].

===Waterways===
There are a number of rivers, canals and other navigable waterways in Kyoto. The Seta and Uji rivers ([[Yodo River]]), Kamogawa and Katsura river flow through Kyoto. [[Lake Biwa Canal]] was a significant infrastructural development. In present days, however, the waterways are not used for passenger or goods transportation except for limited sightseeing purpose such as Hozugawa Kudari boat on the [[Hozu River]].

===Festivals===
Kyoto is well known for its traditional festivals which have been held for over 1000 years and are a major tourist attraction.<ref>Kyoto Visitors Guide (1998). Kyoto Tourist Office, Kyoto City Council.</ref> The first is the [[Aoi Matsuri]] on May 15. Two months later (July 1 to 31) is the [[Gion Matsuri]] known as one of the 3 great festivals of Japan, culminating in a massive parade on July 17. Kyoto marks the [[Bon Festival]] with the [[Gozan no Okuribi]], lighting fires on mountains to guide the spirits home (August 16). The October 22 [[Jidai Matsuri]], Festival of the Ages, celebrates Kyoto's illustrious past.

==Sports==

===Football===
In football, Kyoto is represented by [[Kyoto Sanga F.C.]] who won the [[Emperor's Cup]] in 2002, and rose to [[J. League]]'s Division 1 in 2005. Kyoto Sanga has a long history as an amateur non-company club, although it was only with the advent of professionalization that it was able to compete in the Japanese top division.

Amateur football clubs such as F.C. Kyoto BAMB 1993 and Kyoto Shiko Club (both breakaway factions of the original Kyoto Shiko club that became Kyoto Sanga) as well as unrelated AS Laranja Kyoto compete in the regional Kansai soccer league.

===Baseball===
Between 1951 and 1952 the [[Central League]] team [[Shochiku Robins]] played their franchised games at {{nihongo|[[Kinugasa Ballpark]]|[[:ja:<U+8863><U+7B20><U+7403><U+5834>]]|''Kinugasa Kyujo''}} in Kita-ku. In 2010, Nishikyogoku Stadium in Ukyo-ku became the home of a newly formed girls professional baseball team, the Kyoto Asto Dreams.

Additionally, Kyoto's high school baseball teams are strong, with Heian and Toba in particular making strong showings recently at the [[High school baseball in Japan|annual tournament]] held in [[Koshien Stadium]], [[Nishinomiya]], near Osaka.

===Horse racing===
[[Kyoto Racecourse]] in Fushimi-ku is one of ten racecourses operated by the [[Japan Racing Association]]. It hosts notable horse races including the [[Kikuka-sh<U+014D>]], [[Tenno Sho|Spring Tenno Sho]], and [[Queen Elizabeth II Commemorative Cup]].

== International relations ==
Kyoto, having been the capital city of Japan, a seat of learning and culture, has long-established ties with other great cities around the world. Many foreign scholars, artists and writers have stayed in Kyoto over the centuries.
