"'''Isn't It a Pity'''" is a song by [[George Harrison]] from his 1970 solo album ''[[All Things Must Pass]]''. It appears in two variations there: one the well-known, seven-minute version; the other a [[reprise]], as the original album's penultimate track (excluding the ''Apple Jam'' bonus disc), known as "'''Isn't It a Pity (Version Two)'''". The song was written in 1966, but despite the popularity and success it would subsequently achieve, both for Harrison and for artists who have covered it, "Isn't It a Pity" was rejected for inclusion on releases by [[The Beatles]].

A big anthemic ballad and one of George Harrison's most celebrated songs, it has been described as the emotional and musical centrepiece of ''All Things Must Pass''<ref name="Leng pp 86-87, 98" /> and "a poignant reflection on The Beatles' coarse ending".<ref name="Bergstrom/PM" /> "Isn't It a Pity" was also released on a [[A-side and B-side#Double A-side|double A-side]] single with "[[My Sweet Lord]]" in many countries around the world (but not Britain) and reached number 1 in Canada as the preferred side. The song has been recorded by numerous artists, including [[Nina Simone]], [[Matt Monro]], [[The Three Degrees]], [[Cowboy Junkies]], [[Galaxie 500]], [[Television Personalities]], [[Paul Young]], [[Elliott Smith]], [[Pedro Aznar]] and [[Roberta Flack]].

==Background and composition==
While no longer the "really tight" social unit they had been throughout the chaos of [[Beatlemania]]<ref>George Harrison, in The Beatles, p. 83.</ref> <U+2212> or the "four-headed monster", as [[Mick Jagger]] famously called them<ref>[http://www.superseventies.com/ssgeorgeharrison.html George Harrison <U+2212> In His Own Words], Superseventies.com (retrieved 3 October 2012).</ref><ref>Caroline Gammell, [http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/music/music-news/8531033/Rolling-Stones-envied-The-Beatles-singing-prowess-Sir-Paul.html "Rolling Stones envied The Beatles' singing prowess <U+2212> Sir Paul"], ''The Telegraph'' online, 23 May 2011 (retrieved 25 June 2012).</ref> <U+2212> the individual [[Beatles]] were still bonded by genuine friendship during their final, troubled years as a band,<ref>Hertsgaard, p. 310.</ref> even if it was now more of a case of being locked together at a deep psychological level after such a sustained period of heightened experience.<ref>MacDonald, pp 288, 300.</ref> [[Eric Clapton]] has described this bond as being just like that of a typical family, "with all the difficulties that entails".<ref>Eric Clapton interview, in ''George Harrison: Living in the Material World''.</ref> When the band finally split, in April 1970 <U+2212> a "terrible surprise" for the outside world, in the words of author [[Mark Hertsgaard]], "like the sudden death of a beloved young uncle"<ref>Hertsgaard, p. 277.</ref> <U+2212> even the traditionally most disillusioned Beatle, George Harrison, suffered a mild bereavement.<ref>Leng, p. 91.</ref>

Towards the end of May that year, among the dozens of tracks that would be considered and/or recorded for his ''[[All Things Must Pass]]'' triple album, Harrison returned to a number of unused songs that he had written during the late '60s.<ref>The Editors of ''Rolling Stone'', p. 39.</ref> "Isn't It a Pity" was one of these, having most recently been rejected by The Beatles during the January 1969 ''Get Back'' sessions that resulted in their final album, ''[[Let It Be]]''.<ref>MacDonald, p. 302.</ref><ref>Miles, p. 332.</ref> According to [[Abbey Road Studios|Abbey Road]] engineer [[Geoff Emerick]], however, the song had been offered for inclusion on 1967's ''[[Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band]]'', while [[Mark Lewisohn]], the band's acknowledged recording historian, has stated that it was first presented during sessions for the previous year's ''[[Revolver (album)|Revolver]]''.<ref>MacDonald, p. 302fn.</ref> Lewisohn's opinion appears to tally with a [[Bootleg recording|bootlegged]] conversation from the ''Get Back'' sessions, where Harrison reveals that [[John Lennon]] had vetoed "Isn't It a Pity" three years before, and that he (Harrison) considered offering the song to [[Frank Sinatra]].<ref>Sulpy & Schweighardt, p. 269.</ref> (Harrison had recently met Sinatra in Los Angeles while working there with [[Apple Records|Apple]] signing [[Jackie Lomax]].<ref>Clayson, ''George Harrison'', pp 259<U+2212>60.</ref>)

Despite its relative antiquity by 1970, the song's lyrics lent themselves perfectly to the themes of spiritual salvation and friendship that define ''All Things Must Pass'',<ref>Leng, pp 86<U+2212>87, 91<U+2212>92.</ref><ref name="Eds of RS p 40">The Editors of ''Rolling Stone'', p. 40.</ref> being consistent with the [[karma|karmic]] subject matter of much of the album.<ref name=pity>Matthew Greenwald, {{cite web|title=Isn't It a Pity|url={{Allmusic|class=song|id=t743155|pure_url=yes}}|publisher=|accessdate=}} [[Allmusic]] (retrieved 25 June 2012).</ref> Harrison would later say of the track: "'Isn't It a Pity' is about whenever a relationship hits a down point ... It was a chance to realise that if I felt somebody had let ''me'' down, then there's a good chance ''I'' was letting someone else down."<ref>Harrison, p. 170.</ref> His lyrics therefore take a nonjudgmental tone throughout:<ref name=autogenerated1 />

{{bquote|''Isn't it a pity, isn't it a shame <br> How we break each other's hearts, and cause each other pain <br> How we take each other's love without thinking any more <br> Forgetting to give back, now isn't it a pity. <br> <br> Some things take so long, but how do I explain? <br> Not too many people can see we're all the same <br> And because of all their tears, their eyes can't hope to see <br> The beauty that surrounds them <U+2212> oh, isn't it a pity.''}}

Harrison biographer Ian Inglis has referred to the song's "surprisingly complex" lyrics, which in one sense can be seen as a personal observation on a "failed love affair" yet at the same time serve as a comment on "the universal love for, and among, humankind".<ref>Inglis, pp 25, 26.</ref> This theme had featured in previous Harrison songs such as "[[Within You, Without You]]" and "[[While My Guitar Gently Weeps]]" and would remain prominent in much of his subsequent compositions.<ref name="Inglis p 26">Inglis, p. 26.</ref> The same parallels regarding the universality of love in Harrison's work has been noted by [[Dale Allison]], author of the first "spiritual biography" on the ex-Beatle; "When George asks, 'Isn't It A Pity?'," Allison writes, "the scope of his question is vast: it embraces almost everything."<ref>Allison, p. 34.</ref>

The verse-one lines "''How we take each other's love without thinking any more / Forgetting to give back ...''" have been acknowledged as a precursor to [[Paul McCartney]]'s parting [[couplet]] <U+2212> "''And in the end, the love you take / Is equal to the love you make''" <U+2212> in The Beatles' ''[[Abbey Road]]'' song "[[The End (The Beatles song)|The End]]".<ref name="The_Beatles_Bible" />

==Recording==
Two contrasting versions of the song were recorded in London in mid 1970 during the sessions for ''All Things Must Pass'',<ref>Badman, p. 10.</ref> both of which were intended for release, from the outset.<ref name="Madinger & Easter p 428" /> The so-called "Isn<U+2019>t It a Pity (Version Two)" is noticeably slower than the better known, seven-minute "epic" reading of the song.<ref name=autogenerated4>Leng, p. 98.</ref> [[Eric Clapton]]<U+2019>s lead guitar fills, [[flanging|phased]] piano from [[Tony Ashton]], and [[John Barham]]-arranged [[Woodwind instrument|woodwinds]] dominate Version Two,<ref name=autogenerated4 /> which is also more in keeping with The Beatles<U+2019> earlier attempts on the track; as with "[[Ballad of Sir Frankie Crisp (Let It Roll)|Ballad of Sir Frankie Crisp]]", it features extensive use of the [[Leslie speaker]] sound so familiar from the band's ''Abbey Road'' album.<ref name="Madinger & Easter p 432">Madinger & Easter, p. 432.</ref>

Like the concurrently recorded "[[My Sweet Lord]]", the album's other "Isn't It a Pity" betrays the influence of co-producer [[Phil Spector]] more so than the comparatively sedate Version Two.<ref name=autogenerated4 /><ref name="Madinger & Easter p 432"/> It is also the most extreme example of Harrison's stated intention to allow some of the songs on ''All Things Must Pass'' to run to a longer length and feature instrumentation to a greater degree than had been possible within the confines of the more [[Pop music|pop]]-oriented Beatles approach to recording.<ref name="Eds of RS p 40" /> <U+201C>Isn<U+2019>t It a Pity<U+201D> (Version One, in its ''All Things Must Pass'' context) starts small and builds<ref name="Huntley p 55">Huntley, p. 55.</ref> <U+2212> "and it builds and it builds", ''[[NME]]'''s Alan Smith would soon write.<ref name="Smith/NME">Alan Smith, "George Harrison: ''All Things Must Pass'' (Apple)", ''[[NME]]'', 5 December 1970; available at [http://www.rocksbackpages.com/article.html?ArticleID=20023 Rock's Back Pages] (''subscription required''; retrieved 15 July 2012).</ref> Taping of the backing track took place at [[Abbey Road Studios]] on 2 June,<ref name="Spizer p 212">Spizer, p. 212.</ref> and judging by Spector's comments regarding Harrison's early mixes, the orchestral arrangement was not added until late August at the earliest.<ref name="The_Beatles_Bible" /><ref name="Madinger & Easter p 428" /> The first [[Slide guitar|slide-guitar]] break on the released recording, quite possibly [[overdubbing|overdubbed]] some time after the June sessions also, would adopt a near-identical melody to the one Harrison had vocalised when routining the song for the other Beatles on 26 January 1969<ref name="Spizer p 212" /> <U+2212> reflecting a quality admired by [[Elton John]] in the latter's 2002 tribute to Harrison: "All his solos are very melodic <U+2212> you can almost sing his solos."<ref>The Editors of ''Rolling Stone'', p. 233.</ref> Inglis writes that the effect of Harrison's "elaborate patterns" on slide guitar is to "counterbalance the underlying atmosphere of pessimism with shafts of beauty", similar to the "notes of light and dark" provided by [[Pete Drake]]'s [[Pedal steel guitar|pedal steel]] on the song "[[All Things Must Pass (song)|All Things Must Pass]]".<ref>Inglis, pp 26, 30.</ref>

Now in the [[Key (music)|key]] of G (two [[semitones]] down from the ''Get Back'' performance), <U+201C>Isn<U+2019>t It a Pity<U+201D> begins <U+201C>dirge<U+201D>-like<ref name=autogenerated2>Schaffner, p. 142.</ref> with a two-note [[pedal point]] provided by layers of keyboards and acoustic guitars.<ref name=autogenerated1>Leng, p. 86.</ref> (An electric guitar is vaguely audible also, on the left channel of the stereo mix, which could well be Clapton again, although ''While My Guitar Gently Weeps'' author Simon Leng does not credit anyone for the part in his "largely accurate but by no means faultless" player annotations.<ref>Leng, p. 82fn.</ref>) Only at the one-minute mark, at the start of verse two, does the [[rhythm section]] come in, after which the instruments begin to "break out of their metronomic straitjacket to attain an almost ecstatic release<U+201D>, as ''Beatles Forever'' author Nicholas Schaffner put it in 1977.<ref name=autogenerated2 /> The "balmy" slide guitar passage, supported by Barham<U+2019>s string section,<ref name=autogenerated1 /> follows this second verse, and from that point on <U+2212> around 2:38 <U+2212> the same, circular chord structure continues for the remaining four-and-a-half minutes of the song.<ref name="Inglis p 26" /><ref name="Huntley p 55" /> The long fade-out sees what Schaffner termed the <U+201C>pseudo-symphonic tension<U+201D> burst into a frenzy of [[Brass instrument|brass]] and [[tympani]], further [[slide guitar|bottleneck]] soloing, and the "''What a pity''" [[mantra]] joined by <U+201C>[[Hey Jude]]<U+201D>-style "''Na-na-na-na''" chorus.<ref name=autogenerated1 /><ref name=autogenerated2 />

One of the most obvious examples of what ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine's album reviewer would famously christen "the music of mountain tops and vast horizons",<ref name="Gerson/RS" /> "Isn't It a Pity" featured the largest line-up of musicians found on the album <U+2212> including three keyboard players, a trio of extra rhythm guitarists, the orchestral strings, brass and tympani, and a male choir.<ref>Leng, pp 86<U+2212>87.</ref><ref>Clayson, ''George Harrison'', p. 292.</ref> Harrison's former bandmate [[Ringo Starr]] and two others with well-established links to The Beatles, [[Klaus Voormann]] and [[Billy Preston]], were among the participants, on drums, bass and organ, respectively.<ref name=autogenerated1 /> Members of Apple band [[Badfinger]] provided the "felt but not heard" acoustic guitars (behind Harrison's), consistent with Spector's criteria for his self-styled [[Wall of Sound]] technique,<ref name=autogenerated2 /> while author [[Bruce Spizer]] has suggested that [[Peter Frampton]] might have been among the rhythm guitarists also.<ref name="Spizer p 212" /> Another possible participant is [[Maurice Gibb]], Starr's [[Highgate]] neighbour at the time,<ref>Clayson, ''Ringo Starr'', p. 197.</ref> who claimed to have played piano on the song.<ref name="The_Beatles_Bible" /><ref>[http://www.columbia.edu/~brennan/beegees/70.html Gibb Songs: 1970], Columbia.edu (retrieved 10 November 2011).</ref>

==Release==
Originally, the intention had been to release "Isn't It a Pity" as the [[lead single]] from ''All Things Must Pass'' in October 1970,<ref name="Madinger & Easter p 428" /> until Spector and others persuaded Harrison that "[[My Sweet Lord]]" was the most obvious choice.<ref>Phil Spector interview, in ''George Harrison: Living in the Material World''.</ref> The full, seven-minute "Isn<U+2019>t It a Pity" was therefore issued as a [[A-side and B-side#Double A-side|double A-side]] with "My Sweet Lord" on 23 November in the United States and Canada (as Apple 2995), just days before the album's release there.<ref>Castleman & Podrazik, p. 93.</ref><ref name="Spizer p 213">Spizer, p. 213.</ref> Reflecting the equal status of the two tracks, both sides of the single's picture sleeve featured the same [[Barry Feinstein]]-shot photo of Harrison, the only differences being the song title below Harrison's name and the fact that the green [[Apple Records]] logo and catalogue number appeared only on the side for "My Sweet Lord".<ref>Spizer, pp 213<U+2212>14.</ref>

The single was phenomenally successful in North America, and around the world.<ref name=autogenerated2 /><ref>Carr & Tyler, p. 94.</ref><ref>Leng, p. 85.</ref> Both songs reached number 1 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] chart,<ref name=tell>Riley, pp 348<U+2212>49.</ref> but "Isn't It a Pity" was the lead side when the single held the top spot on Canada's [[RPM (magazine)|''RPM'' 100]] chart for five weeks, through to mid January 1971.<ref name="RPM chart">[http://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/rpm/028020-119.01-e.php?brws_s=1&file_num=nlc008388.3733&type=1&interval=24&PHPSESSID=5ppv5gl1nvtb61pjd64e29bap6 "''RPM'' 100 Singles, 26 December 1970"], [[Library and Archives Canada]] (retrieved 4 August 2012).</ref> A few days after the single's release, "Isn't It a Pity" was issued on ''All Things Must Pass'', as the final track on side one of the [[LP record|LP]] format, providing (in biographer Elliot Huntley's words) an "elegiac, plaintive song of reconciliation" after the angry "[[Wah-Wah (song)|Wah-Wah]]".<ref name="Huntley p 55" /> "Isn<U+2019>t It a Pity (Version Two)" appeared in [[reprise]] form, as the penultimate track on side four of the original three-record set.<ref>Castleman &  Podrazik, p. 94.</ref>

Despite this commercial success, and its standing as one of the most-[[cover version|covered]] songs among Harrison<U+2019>s post-Beatles output,<ref name="Clayson p 296" /> <U+201C>Isn<U+2019>t It a Pity" was a notable omission from [[EMI]]/[[Capitol Records|Capitol]]<U+2019>s ''[[The Best of George Harrison]]'' in November 1976.<ref>Rodriguez, p. 128.</ref> It was included on the 2009 compilation ''[[Let It Roll: Songs by George Harrison]]'', however.<ref name=pity/> A [[Demo (music)|demo]] version of the song, recorded during the ''Get Back'' sessions, is also available on ''Let It Roll'' as an [[iTunes Store]] exclusive. 

A live version from December 1991, again with Clapton, was included on the album ''[[Live in Japan (George Harrison album)|Live in Japan]]''.<ref name=pity/>

==Reception==
"Isn<U+2019>t It a Pity" remains one of Harrison<U+2019>s most popular songs with critics and fans alike. [[Allmusic]] calls it "deeply moving and powerful",<ref name=pity/> while in their book on the solo Beatles' recording history, ''Eight Arms to Hold You'', Chip Madinger and Mark Easter declare: "If any George Harrison song can be called 'majestic', 'Isn't It a Pity' would be the one."<ref name="Madinger & Easter p 428">Madinger & Easter, p. 428.</ref> In his December 1970 album review for the ''[[NME]]'', Alan Smith described it as a track that "catches the mood of aching tolerance of pain, which Harrison can do so well" and "a ballad which will stand out from the album with the passing of the years".<ref name="Smith/NME" />

Simon Leng identifies the song as musically "sumptuous" and praises Harrison's inventive melody and "unique" use of notes beyond the [[key signature]], as well as John Barham<U+2019>s <U+201C>evocative, suspended orchestration".<ref name=autogenerated3>Leng, p. 87.</ref> He notes also the similarity of their combined musical counterbalance with elements of Indian [[raga]], in the number of ''[[swaras]]'' (tones) in both ascending and descending [[Musical scale|scales]].<ref name=autogenerated3 /> To Leng, "Isn't It a Pity" is the "pivotal song", the "essence" of ''[[All Things Must Pass]]'', encapsulating the album<U+2019>s struggle between <U+201C>[[gospel music|gospel]] ecstasy and the failure of human relationships<U+201D>.<ref name="Leng pp 86-87, 98">Leng, pp 98, 86<U+2212>87.</ref>

Writing in the late '70s, Nicholas Schaffner noted the song's "towering simplicity" and the "endlessly repetitive fade-out that somehow manages to be hypnotic instead of boring".<ref name=autogenerated2 /> Like Schaffner, a number of commentators have remarked on the significance of "Isn't It a Pity" in the wider, Beatles context,<ref name="BB review/google">[http://books.google.com.au/books?id=mSkEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA34&dq=%22isn't+it+a+pity%22&hl=en&sa=X&ei=O_-1UOHeLYvJmQXho4CQCQ&ved=0CEwQ6AEwBzgK#v=onepage&q=%22isn't%20it%20a%20pity%22&f=false "Album Reviews"], ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'', 19 December 1970, p. 50 (retrieved 28 November 2012).</ref><ref name="Bergstrom/PM">John Bergstrom, [http://www.popmatters.com/pm/review/135411-george-harrison-all-things-must-pass/ "George Harrison: All Things Must Pass"], [[PopMatters]], 14 January 2011 (retrieved 1 April 2012).</ref><ref>Anthony DeCurtis, [http://web.archive.org/web/20060814002619/http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/georgeharrison/albums/album/205260/review/6067390/all_things_must_pass "Album Review: George Harrison ''All Things Must Pass''"], ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', 12 October 2000 (retrieved 1 April 2012).</ref><ref name="Inglis p 26" /> starting with the song's length: 7:10 <U+2013> just a second under "[[Hey Jude]]".<ref name="Eds of RS p 40" /><ref name=autogenerated2 /> Ben Gerson, in his 1971 ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' review, described the song as a "lament <U+2026> whose beginning is the broken thirds of John's '[[I Am the Walrus]]' and whose end is the decadent, exultant last half of Paul's 'Hey Jude'".<ref name="Gerson/RS">Ben Gerson, [http://www.rollingstone.com/music/albumreviews/all-things-must-pass-19710121 "Reviews: George Harrison ''All Things Must Pass''"], ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', 21 January 1971 (retrieved 20 February 2012).</ref> On this point, Leng adds: "Ever bittersweet, 'Isn't It a Pity' records the last dying echoes of the Beatles."<ref name=autogenerated3 />

Elliot Huntley has complained of the song's enforced period in hibernation: "[It] simply beggars belief that the track was rejected by [[George Martin|Martin]], Lennon and McCartney <U+2212> three men whose reputations rested on their ability to spot a good tune when they heard one."<ref>Huntley, p. 60.</ref> Huntley views "Isn't It a Pity" as worthy of "fully fledged [[Standard (music)|standard]]" status, with Barham's "soaring" strings and Harrison's "sublime" slide guitar combining to take the song "into the heavens, where it stays".<ref name="Huntley p 55" />

In 2010, [[AOL Radio]] listeners voted "Isn't It a Pity" seventh in a poll to find the ten best post-Beatles George Harrison songs.<ref>Boonsri Dickinson, [http://www.aolradioblog.com/2010/04/03/best-george-harrison-songs/ "10 Best George Harrison"], [[AOL Radio]], April 2010 (retrieved 25 June 2012).</ref> Both [[Eric Clapton]] and [[Tom Petty]] have named "Isn't It a Pity" among their favourite two Harrison compositions, Petty calling the song "a masterpiece".<ref>The Editors of ''Rolling Stone'', p. 224.</ref>
