'''Cycling infrastructure''' refers to all [[infrastructure]] which may be used by cyclists. This includes the same network of [[road]]s and [[street]]s used by [[motor vehicle|motorists]], except those roads from which cyclists have been banned (e.g., many [[Controlled-access highway|freeways/motorways]]), plus additional bikeways that are not available to motor vehicles, such as [[Segregated cycle facilities#Bikeways that use independent rights-of-way|bike paths]], [[segregated cycle facilities]] and, where permitted, [[sidewalk]]s, plus amenities like [[Bicycle stand|bike racks]] for parking and specialized traffic signs and signals.

The manner in which the public roads network is designed, built and managed can have a significant effect on the utility and safety of cycling. The cycling network may be able to provide the users with direct, convenient routes minimizing unnecessary delay and effort in reaching their destinations.  Settlements with a dense roads network of [[grid plan|interconnected street]]s tend to be viable [[utility cycling]] environments.

==History==
{{main|History of cycling infrastructure}}

==Traffic reduction==
Removing traffic can be achieved by straightforward diversion or alternatively reduction. Diversion involves routing through-traffic away from roads used by high numbers of cyclists and pedestrians. Examples of diversion include the construction of [[Bypass (road)|arterial bypasses]] and ring roads around urban centres.

[[File:New Road, Brighton - shared space.jpg|right|thumb|New Road, Brighton - [[Shared Space]] scheme reduced motor traffic by 93%.]]
Traffic reduction can involve direct or indirect methods. A highly effective indirect method of reducing motor traffic, and facilitating cyclist and pedestrian use, is to adopt the [[shared space]] system. This system, by giving equal priority to all road users, and by removing conventional [[road marking]]s, [[road sign]]s and road conventions, capitalizes on the tendency for all road users to respect and trust each other when they are interacting on an equal basis. No explicit, or even implicit priority is given to traffic traveling along the road, so with no assumptions of priority being possible, all road users need to be aware of all other road users at all times. New Road in [[Brighton]] was remodeled using this philosophy, and the results were a 93% reduction in motor traffic and a 22% increase in cycling traffic.<ref>{{cite web |title=New Road City Centre Shared Space, Brighton (December 2007) |work=Scheme of the Month: January 2008 |publisher=Cycling England |url=http://www.cyclingengland.co.uk/scheme-of-the-month.php |accessdate=2008-03-18 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080202222926/http://www.cyclingengland.co.uk/scheme-of-the-month.php <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2008-02-02}}</ref> Other indirect methods involve reducing the infrastructural capacity dedicated to moving or storing road vehicles. This can involve reducing the number of road lanes, closing bridges to certain vehicle types and creating [[vehicle restricted zones]] or environmental traffic cells. In the 1970s the Dutch city of [[Delft]] began restricting private car traffic from crossing the city centre.<ref>[http://www.urban.nl/childstreet2005/downloads/StevenSchepel-CF..pdf Woonerf revisited]
Delft as an example, Steven Schepel, Childstreet2005 conference, Delft 2005 (Accessed 2007-02-21</ref> Similarly, [[Groningen (city)|Groningen]] is divided into four zones that cannot be crossed by private motor-traffic, (private cars must use the ring road instead).<ref>[http://www.bicyclefixation.com/groningen.htm Transport Planning in Groningen, Holland] Bicycle Fixation (Accessed 2007-01-27)</ref> Cyclists and other traffic can pass between the zones and cycling accounts for 50%+ of trips in Groningen (which reputedly has the third highest proportion of cycle traffic of any city). The Swedish city of [[Gothenburg]] uses a similar system of traffic cells.<ref>[http://web.archive.org/web/20070812190058/http://www.cts.ucl.ac.uk/tsu/tpab9908.htm The Impacts of Reallocating Roadspace on Accident Rates: Some Initial Evidence] Sally Cairns Note from Road Danger Reduction Forum conference, Leicester, 16 February 1999. (Accessed 2014-03-07)</ref> Starting in the 1970s, the city of [[Copenhagen]], which is now noted for high cycling levels, adopted a policy of reducing available car parking capacity by several per cent per year. The city of [[Amsterdam]], where around 40% of all trips are by bicycle,<ref>[http://www.ivv.amsterdam.nl DIVV Amsterdam<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> adopted similar parking reduction policies in the 80s and 90s.

Direct traffic reduction methods can involve straightforward bans or more subtle methods like [[road pricing]] schemes or [[road diet]]s. The [[London congestion charge]] reportedly resulted in a significant increase in cycle use within the affected area.<ref>[http://www.tfl.gov.uk/assets/downloads/businessandpartners/cycling-in-london-report.pdf Cycling in London Report, May 2008 section 4.6]</ref>

==One-way streets==

Some campaigners view [[one-way street]] systems as a product of traffic management that focuses on trying to keep motorized vehicles moving regardless of the social and other impacts.<ref>{{cite news |title=Oped: Time to end one-way thinking |first1=Matt |last1=Hanka |first2=John |last2=Gilderbloom |authorlink2=John Gilderbloom |date=31 January 2008 |newspaper=[[The Courier-Journal]] |url=http://www.courier-journal.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20080201/OPINION04/802010386 |accessdate=2015-01-31}}{{subscription required}}</ref> On the other hand, some UK traffic planners state that one-way streets are a useful tool for traffic calming, and for eliminating [[rat run]]s.<ref>{{cite web |title=Traffic calming schemes: One way streets, banned turning movements and no entry restrictions |publisher=Bury Metropolitan Borough Council |url=http://www.bury.gov.uk/TransportAndStreets/MotorVehiclesRoadsAndParking/TrafficCalming/default.htm#One way streets |accessdate=2008-03-26}}</ref> ''CFI'' states that one-way streets can seriously disadvantage cyclists on the grounds that they introduce additional trip-length, delay and hazards associated with weaving maneuvers at junctions.<ref name="cfi1"/><!-- CFI page 48 --> ''CFI'' refers to other research indicating that in almost every case it is possible to exempt cyclists from one-way restrictions.<ref name="cfi1"/><!-- CFI page 48 --> In northern Europe, cyclists are frequently granted exemptions from one-way street restrictions.<ref>{{cite web|title=Ministerieel rondschrijven betreffende de toepassing van het beperkt <U+00E9><U+00E9>nrichtingsverkeer|work=Belgisch Staatsblad|date=1998-11-13|url=http://www.ejustice.just.fgov.be/cgi/article_body.pl?language=nl&caller=summary&pub_date=1998-11-13&numac=1998014288}}, {{cite web|title=Circulaire minist<U+00E9>rielle relative <U+00E0> l'application du sens unique limit<U+00E9>|work=Moniteur Belge|date=13 November 1998|url=http://www.ejustice.just.fgov.be/cgi/article_body.pl?language=fr&caller=summary&pub_date=1998-11-13&numac=1998014288}}</ref> German research indicates that making one-way streets two-way for cyclists results in a reduction in the total number of collisions.<ref>[http://www.pgv-hannover.de/Aktuelles/Artikel_Einbahnstrassen_mit_gegengerichtetem_Radverkehr.pdf Verkehrssicherheit in Einbahnstra<U+00DF>en mit gegengerichtetem Radverkehr], Alrutz, D., Angenendt, W., Draeger, W., G<U+00FC>ndel, D., Stra<U+00DF>enverkehrstechnik, 6/2002</ref> It is also argued{{Who|date=March 2008}} that contraflow cyclists may be at reduced risk of certain types of accident - particularly so called "dooring" type incidents.<!-- Need ref to Velocity 2005 paper on SUL in Brussels --> In [[Belgium]] road authorities can in principle allow any one-way streets in {{convert|50|km/h|mph}} zones to be two-way for cyclists if the available lane is at least {{convert|3| m|ft}} wide (area free from parking) and no specific local circumstances prevent it.<ref>[http://www.fiets.irisnet.be/download/sul_fr.pdf Le SUL Cyclistes a contresens dans les sens uniques] Groupe de Recherche et d<U+2019>Action des Cyclistes Quotidiens, Brussels 2006, (Accessed 2007-01-27)</ref>

==Junction design==

In general, [[Junction (road)|junction]] designs that favour higher-speed turning, weaving and merging movements by motorists tend to be hostile for cyclists. ''CFI'' states that free-flowing arrangements are hazardous for cyclists and should be avoided.<ref name="cfi1"/><!-- CFI page 57--> Features such as large entry curvature, slip-roads and high flow [[roundabouts]] are associated with increased risk of car<U+2013>cyclist collisions.<ref name="HensonWhelan1992">Layout and Design Factors Affecting Cycle Safety at T-Junctions, Henson R. and Whelan N., Traffic Engineering and Control, October 1992</ref><ref name="LayfieldMaycock1987">Pedal cyclists at dual carriage-way slip roads, M.C.

==Traffic signals/Traffic control systems==

[[File:Cyclists at Hyde Park corner roundabout in London.jpg|thumb|Cyclists use a segregated cut through of a busy interchange in [[London]] at rush hour.]]
How [[traffic signal]]s are designed and implemented directly impacts cyclists.<ref name=ClarkMatthew2000>Priority for cycling in an urban traffic control system, Stephen D. Clark, Matthew W. Page, Institute for Transport Studies, University of Leeds, Velomondial Conference Proceedings, Amsterdam 2000</ref> For instance, poorly adjusted vehicle detector systems, used to trigger signal changes, may not correctly detect cyclists. This can leave cyclists in the position of having to "run" red lights if no motorized vehicle arrives to trigger a signal change.<ref>[http://www.bikexprt.com/bicycle/actuator.htm   Traffic Signal Actuators: Am I Paranoid?] John S. Allen, 2003 (Accessed 25 March 2008)</ref> Some cities use urban adaptive traffic control systems (UTCs), which use linked traffic signals to manage traffic in response to changes in demand.<ref name=ClarkMatthew2000 /> There is an argument that using a UTC system merely to provide for increased capacity for motor traffic will simply drive growth in such traffic.<ref name="its549">Assessing the Impact of Local Transport Policy Instruments Susan Grant-Muller (Editor), ITS Working Paper 549, Institute of Transport Studies, Leeds University, April 2000</ref> However, there are more direct negative impacts. For instance, where signals are arranged to provide motor traffic with so called [[green wave]]s, this can create "red waves" for other road users such as cyclists and public transport services.<ref name=ClarkMatthew2000/> Traffic managers in Copenhagen have now turned this approach on its head and are linking cyclist-specific traffic signals on a major arterial bike lane to provide green waves for rush hour cycle-traffic.<ref>[http://www.cyclenetwork.org.uk/news/ccn85.pdf Green wave for cycles], Cycle Campaign Network News, No 85, November 2006</ref> However, this would still not resolve the problem of red-waves for slow (old and young) and fast (above average fitness) cyclists. Cycling-specific measures that can be applied at traffic signals include the use of [[advanced stop line]]s and/or bypasses. In some cases cyclists might be given a free-turn or a signal bypass if turning into a road on the nearside.<ref name="cfi1"/>

==Signposting==
[[Image:2014 Mountain pass cycling milestone - Col d'Izoard Guillestre.jpg|thumb|150px|One of the [[mountain pass cycling milestones]] placed along the climb to the [[Col d'Izoard]] in the French Alps.]]
In many places worldwide special signposts for bicycles are used to indicate directions and distances to destinations for cyclists. Apart from signposting in and between urban areas,<ref>{{cite web|title=Holland-Cycling.com - Signposting|url=http://www.holland-cycling.com/tips-and-info/finding-your-way/signposting|publisher=Holland-cycling|accessdate=28 August 2014}}</ref> [[mountain pass cycling milestones]] have become an important service for bicycle tourists. They provide cyclists with information about their current position with regard to the summit of the [[mountain pass]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Cycling - Pra Loup|url=http://www.praloup.com/activities-summer/cycling-summer.html |publisher=Val<U+00E9>e Ubaye|accessdate=25 August 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Peak Retreats Alpine activities.

==Redistribution of the roadway/carriageway==

One method for reducing potential friction between cyclists and motorized vehicles is to provide "wide kerb", or "nearside", lanes (UK terminology) or "[[wide outside lane|wide outside through lane]]" (U.S. terminology). These extra-wide lanes increase the probability that motorists pass cyclists at a safe distance without having to change lanes.<ref>[http://www.velonews.com/news/fea/9283.0.html Legally Speaking - with Bob Mionske: Law of the land<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> This is held to be particularly important on routes with a high proportion of wide vehicles such as [[bus]]es or [[heavy goods vehicle]]s (HGVs). They also provide more room for cyclists to filter past queues of cars in congested conditions and to safely overtake each other. Due to the tendency of all vehicle users to stay in the center of their lane, it would be necessary to sub-divide the cycle lane with a broken white line to facilitate safe overtaking. Overtaking is indispensable for cyclists, as speeds are not dependent on the legal speed limit, but on the rider's capability.

[[Shared space]] schemes extend this principle further by removing the reliance on lane markings altogether, and also removing road signs and signals, allowing all road users to use any part of the road, and giving all road users equal priority and equal responsibility for each other's safety. Experiences where these schemes are in use show that road users, particularly motorists, undirected by signs, kerbs, or road markings, reduce their speed and establish eye contact with other users. Results from the thousands of such implementations worldwide all show casualty reductions and most also show reduced journey times.<ref name="g_20080229">{{cite news |title=Rip out the traffic lights and railings. Our streets are better without them |author=Simon Jenkins |date=29 February 2008 |publisher=Guardian News and Media |work=The Guardian |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2008/feb/29/guardiancolumnists |accessdate=2008-03-18}}</ref> After the partial conversion of London's [[Kensington High Street]] to shared space, accidents decreased by 44% (the London average was 17%).<ref name="g_20080229"/>

[[File:Busspur und Haltestelle in Mannheim 100 9128.jpg|thumb|A [[bus and cycle lane]] in [[Mannheim]], [[Germany]]]]
''CFI'' argues for a marked lane width of {{convert|4.25|m|ft}}.<ref name="cfi1"/> On undivided roads, width provides cyclists with adequate clearance from passing HGVs while being narrow enough to deter drivers from "doubling up" to form two lanes. This "doubling up" effect may be related to junctions. At non-junction locations, greater width might be preferable if this effect can be avoided. The [[European Commission]] specifically endorses wide lanes in its policy document on cycling promotion, ''Cycling: the way ahead for towns and cities''.<ref>[http://ec.europa.eu/environment/cycling/cycling_en.pdf Cycling: the way ahead for towns and cities], European Commission, 1999</ref>

[[Shared bus and cycle lane]]s are also a widely endorsed method for providing for cyclists. Research carried out by the Transport Research Laboratory (TRL) describes shared bus cycle lanes as "generally very popular" with cyclists.<ref name="trl_buslane">Cycling in bus lanes, Reid S and Guthrie N TRL Report 610, Transport Research Laboratory 2004</ref> Guidance produced for [[Cycling England]] endorses bus lanes because they provide cyclists with a "direct and barrier-free route into town centres" while avoiding complications related to shared-use footways.<ref>A.10 Bus Lanes and Bus Stops [[Cycling England]] design guidelines 2007</ref> A French survey found that 42% of cyclists were "enthusiasts" for shared bus-bike lanes, versus 33% who had mixed opinions, and 27% who opposed them.<ref name="velocite_tc_couloir">[http://www.fubicy.org/ancien_site/velocite/articles/velocite-80-tc&velo-1.pdf La compl<U+00E9>mentarit<U+00E9> entre v<U+00E9>lo et transport public] V<U+00E9>locit<U+00E9> - la revue du cycliste urbain N<U+00B0> 79, janv. / f<U+00E9>v. 2005</ref> Many cycling activists view these as being more attractive than cycle paths, while others object to being close to bus exhausts,<ref name="velocite_tc_couloir"/> a problem easily avoided through replacing exhaust buses with [[Electric bus|electric ones]].

== Bikeways ==
<!-- [[Bikeway]] redirects here -->
A bikeway is a general American English term for a route, way or path which in some manner is specifically designed and /or designated for [[bicycle]] travel. It comes in various forms and names such as (but not limited to): [[bicycle boulevard]], [[bicycle trail]], [[foreshoreway]], [[Greenway (landscape)|greenway]] or [[Shared lane marking|sharrow]].

===Bicycle superhighways===
[[Denmark]] has pioneered the concept of <U+201C>bicycle superhighways<U+201D> to increase the speed, safety, and comfort of bicycle commuting. The first route, C99, opened in 2012 between the [[Vesterbro, Copenhagen|Vesterbro]] rail station in [[Copenhagen]] and [[Albertslund]], a western suburb. The route cost 13.4 million DKK and is 17.5&nbsp;km long, built with few stops and new paths away from traffic. <U+201C>Service stations<U+201D> with air pumps are located at regular intervals, and where the route must cross streets, handholds and running boards are provided so cyclists can wait without having to put their feet on the ground.<ref>http://www.cykelsuperstier.dk/project</ref>

===Segregated cycle facilities===
{{Main|Segregated cycle facilities}}
[[Image:Fahrradstrasse.jpg|250px|thumb|Segregated cycle facility in Karlsruhe, Germany. Fahrradstrasse means "bicycle street."]] Segregated cycle facilities such as cycle lanes and cycle tracks are often advocated as a means of promoting [[utility cycling]].  A pro-cycling paper, stated to have been accepted for publication in the ''Transport Reviews'' journal, states that "the provision of separate cycling facilities" appears to be one of the keys to the achieving of high levels of cycling in the Netherlands, Denmark and Germany.<ref name="pucher_buehler">{{cite journal |author=Pucher and Buehler |title=Making Cycling Irresistible: Lessons from the Netherlands, Denmark, and Germany |date=12 November 2007 |url=http://policy.rutgers.edu/faculty/pucher/Irresistible.pdf|format=PDF}}</ref>  Streets or paths that are open to cyclists but not motorists can benefit cyclists where they provide links that are more convenient than the main road network, or help resolve obstacles. Examples include routes through pedestrian precincts. However, to allow the same level of unhindered travel and safety of all, it is important to that cycle infrastructure is as pedestrian free as motor vehicle infrastructure.

===Bicycle boulevards===
{{Main|Bicycle boulevard}}
A bicycle boulevard is a low speed street which has been optimized for bicycle traffic. Bicycle boulevards discourage cut-through motor vehicle traffic but allow local motor vehicle traffic. They are designed to give priority to cyclists as through-going traffic.

===Greenways===
[[File:Former railroad line transformed into bicyle path.jpg|250px|thumb|Former railroad line transformed into bicycle path between [[Metelen]] and [[Steinfurt]] in Germany]]
{{Main|Greenway (landscape)}}
A greenway is a long, narrow piece of land, often used for recreation and pedestrian and bicycle user traffic, and sometimes for streetcar, light rail or retail uses.

===Shared-use path===
{{main|shared use path}}
A [[shared use path]] supports multiple modes, such as walking, bicycling, inline skating and people in wheelchairs.

===Local bikeway strategies to encouraging cycling===
Aspects of infrastructure may be viewed as either cyclist-hostile or as [[bicycle friendly|cyclist-friendly]]. In general, roads infrastructure based on prioritizing certain routes in an attempt to create a state of constant "[[traffic flow]]" for vehicles on that route, will tend to be hostile to those not on that route. In 1996, the British [[Cyclists' Touring Club]] (CTC) and the [[Chartered Institution of Highways and Transportation|Institute for Highways and Transportation]] jointly produced the document "Cycle-friendly infrastructure: Guidelines for planning and design" (CFI).<ref name="cfi1">[http://www.iht.org/publications/technical/cyclefriendly.asp Cycle-Friendly Infrastructure: Guidelines for Planning and Design], Institution of Highways and Transportation, Cyclists Touring Club, 1996.</ref> This defined a hierarchy of measures for cycling [[Promotion (marketing)|promotion]] in which the goal is to convert a more or less cyclist-hostile roads infrastructure into one which encourages and facilitates cycling:
# Traffic reduction. Can traffic levels, particularly of heavy vehicles, be reduced?
# Traffic calming. Can speed be reduced and driver behaviour modified? <ref>Traffic calming examples around the world [http://bicyclesworkintheworld.com/tag/traffic-calming], accessed 9 February 2015</ref>
# Junction treatment and traffic management. These measures include:
#* Urban traffic control systems designed to recognize cyclists and give them priority.
#* Exempt cyclists from banned turns and access restrictions.
#* Provide contra-flow cycle lanes on one-way streets.
#* Implement on-street parking restrictions.
#* Provide [[advanced stop line]]s/bypasses for cyclists at traffic signals.
#* Junction alterations, signalize roundabouts, cycle-friendly junction design.
# Redistribution of the carriageway -such as by marking wide kerb lanes or shared bus/cycle lanes.
# [[Cycle lane]]s and cycle tracks. Having considered and implemented all the above, what cycle tracks or cycle lanes are considered necessary?

Summaries of the actions that have been successful [[Cycling in the Netherlands|in the Netherlands]] are available in English.<ref>Cycling in the Netherlands.

==Trip-end facilities==

===Bicycle parking/storage arrangements===
{{main|Bicycle parking}}

[[File:Bicycle parking lot.jpg|thumb|Bicycle parking lot in [[Amsterdam]].]]

As secure and convenient [[bicycle parking]] is a key factor in influencing a person's decision to cycle, decent parking infrastructure must be provided to encourage the uptake of cycling.<ref>[http://www.tfhrc.gov/safety/pedbike/pubs/05085/chapt17.htm Lesson 17: Bicycle Parking and Storage]</ref> Decent bicycle parking involves weather-proof infrastructure such as [[bicycle locker|lockers]], [[bicycle stand|stand]]s, manned or unmanned bicycle parks,<ref>{{citation| title=Integration of bicycles and transit |page=39 |author=Michael Baltes| publisher=National Research Council (U.S.). Transportation Research Board |year=2005 |quote=The first staffed bicycle parking facility in the United States was opened in Long Beach, California.}}</ref> as well as bike parking facilities within workplaces to facilitate [[bicycle commuting]]. It also will help if certain legal arrangements are put into place to enable legitimate ''ad hoc'' parking, for example to allow people to lock their bicycles to [[Guard rail|railing]]s, signs and other [[street furniture]] when individual proper bike stands are unavailable.<ref>{{citation |title=Success is on the cards |publisher=London Cyclist |date=June<U+2013>July 2009 |page=6}}</ref>

=== Other trip end facilities ===
Some people need to wear special clothes such as [[business suit]]s or [[uniforms]] in their daily work. In some cases the nature of the cycling infrastructure and the prevailing weather conditions may make it very hard to both cycle and maintain the work clothes in a presentable condition. It is argued that such workers can be encouraged to cycle by providing lockers, changing rooms and shower facilities where they can change before starting work.<ref>[http://www.lcc.org.uk/index.asp?PageID=432 Guide for Employers: Showers, lockers and drying room], London Cycling Campaign, 13 September 2006 (Accessed 16 August 2007)</ref>

== Theft reduction measures ==
The theft of bicycles is one of the major problems that slow the development of urban cycling. Bicycle theft discourages regular cyclists from buying new bicycles, as well as putting off people who might want to invest in a bicycle.

Several measures can help reduce bicycle theft:
* [[Bicycle registration]] to enable recovery if stolen
* Making cyclists aware of [[antitheft]] devices and their effective use
* Mounting [[sting operation]]s to catch thieves
* Offering [http://www.holland-cycling.com/tips-and-info/services/bicycle-parking safe bicycle parking facilities] such as guarded bicycle parking (manned or with camera surveillance) or bicycle lockers
* Promoting devices to enable remote tracking of a bicycle's location
* Targeting cycle thieves
* Using [[Folding bicycles]] which can be safely stored (for example) in cloakrooms or under desks.

Certain [[Europe]]an countries apply such measures with success, such as the [[Netherlands]] or certain [[Germany|German]] cities using registration and recovery. Since mid-2004, [[France]] has instituted a system of registration, in some places allowing stolen bicycles to be put on file in partnership with the urban cyclists' associations. This approach has reputedly increased the stolen bicycle recovery rate to more than 40%. By comparison, before the commencement of registration, the recovery rate in France was about 2%.

In some areas of the [[United Kingdom]], bicycles fitted with location tracking devices are left poorly secured in theft hot-spots. When the bike is stolen, the police can locate it and arrest the thieves. This sometimes leads to the dismantling of organized bicycle theft rings, as bike theft generally enjoys a very low priority with the police.

== Help with hills ==
Some cyclists have difficulty climbing steep hills, and devices such as the [[Trampe bicycle lift]], in [[Trondheim]], have been developed to help alleviate this problem. 
Other cyclists use them to increase their physical fitness.

==Integration with other transport modes==

Cycling can often be integrated successfully with other transport modes. For example, in the Netherlands and Denmark a large number of train journeys may start by bicycle. In 1991, 44% of Dutch train travelers went to their local station by bicycle and 14% used a bicycle at their destinations.<ref>Ton Welleman: The autumn of the Bicycle Master Plan: after the plans, the products in: Proceedings of the 8th VELO-CITY Conference, Basel, 26<U+2013>30 September 1995</ref> The key ingredients for this are claimed to be:
* an efficient, attractive and affordable train service
* secure bike parking at train stations
* a quick and easy bicycle rental system for commuters, the [http://www.holland-cycling.com/tips-and-info/services/bicycle-rental OV-bicycle scheme], at train stations
* a town planning policy that results in a sufficient proportion of the potential commuter population (e.g. 44%) living/working within a reasonable cycling distance of the train stations.

It has been argued in relation to this aspect of Dutch or Danish policy that ongoing investment in rail services is vital to maintaining their levels of cycle use.

An often forgotten major success story is the integration of cycling and public transport is Japan.<ref>[http://www.runmuki.com/paul/writing/japantrip.html Cycling for Transportation: The Japanese Example] By Paul Dorn (Accessed 2007-01-27)</ref> Starting in 1978, Japan expanded bicycle parking supply at railway stations from 598,000 spaces in 1977 to 2,382,000 spaces in 1987. As of 1987, Japanese provisions included 516 multi-story garages for bicycle parking.<ref name="reploggle1">Bicycle Access to Public Transportation: Learning from Abroad by Michael Replogle, Journal of the Institute for Transportation Engineers, December 1992</ref>

In January 2007, the European parliament adopted a motion decreeing that all international trains must carry bicycles.<ref>[http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getDoc.do?pubRef=-//EP//TEXT+TA+P6-TA-2007-0005+0+DOC+XML+V0//EN&language=EN Article 4a European Parliament legislative resolution] on the Council common position on international rail passengers' rights and obligations (5892/1/2006 <U+2013> C6-0311/2006<U+2013>2004/0049(COD)) January 2007</ref> In some cities, bicycles may also be carried on local [[train]]s, [[tram]]s and [[bus]]es so that they may be used at either end of the trip. The Rheinbahn transit company in [[D<U+00FC>sseldorf]] permits bicycle carriage on all its bus, tram and train services at any time of the day,<ref>[http://www.rheinbahn.de/opencms/opencms/html/en/index.htm?size=mittel&url=/html/en/main/tickets/fahrrad.htm Taking bicycles on the VRR] Rheinische Bahngesellschaft AG (Accessed 2007-02-23)</ref> while in Munich it is strictly forbidden, under threat of calling the police. In [[France]], the prestigious [[TGV]] high-speed trains are even having some of their first class capacity converted to store bicycles.<ref>[http://www.cyclenetwork.org.uk/latest/archive2006.html#bikeclass First class to bike class] Cycle Campaign Network News Archive 2006 (Accessed 2007-02-23)</ref> There have also been schemes, such as in [[Victoria, British Columbia]], [[Acadia]], and [[Canberra, Australia]] to provide bicycle carriage on buses using externally mounted [[bike carrier]]s.<ref>[http://www.bctransit.com/regions/vic/transitplus/bike_and_ride.cfm Bike and Ride<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>[http://www.exploreacadia.com/explore.html New Ways to Explore Acadia<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>[http://www.action.act.gov.au/bike_n_ride.html ACTION Buses: Bike and Ride]</ref>

In [[Edmonton, Alberta, Canada]], all bus routes have externally mounted carriers for bicycles. All public transit buses in Chicago and suburbs allow up to two bikes at all times.<ref>http://www.edmonton.ca/transportation/ets/riding_ets/bikes-on-ets-buses.aspx</ref><ref name="yourcta.com">http://www.yourcta.com/downloads/brochures/biketran.pdf</ref><ref>[http://www.pacebus.com/sub/bus_system/bicycle_racks.asp Pace Bus - Bicycle Racks<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> The same is true of [[Grand River Transit]] buses in the [[Region of Waterloo]], Ontario, Canada.<ref>[http://grt.ca/web/transit.nsf/DocID/6A24334E452B5D7385256C2500685AEA?OpenDocument Bus 'n' Bike]</ref> Trains allow bikes with some restrictions.<ref name="yourcta.com"/><ref>http://metrarail.com/Special_Promotions/bikes_on_trains.html</ref> Where such services are not available, some cyclists get around this restriction by removing their pedals and loosening their handlebars as to fit into a box or by using [[folding bicycle|folding bikes]] that can be brought onto the train or bus like a piece of luggage. The article on [[Public transport in Christchurch#Bikes on buses|buses in Christchurch, New Zealand]] lists [[Public transport in Christchurch#Suburban bus services|27 routes]] with bike racks.

However, there are strong cultural variations in how cycling is treated in such situations. For instance in the Irish [[university]] city of [[Galway]], the same town that suggested cyclists dismount and walk across each intersection, the secure parking of bikes is forbidden within the grounds of the central train station. However, cut-price car parking is available for motorists holding a valid train ticket.
