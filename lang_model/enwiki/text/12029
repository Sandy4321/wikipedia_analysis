Notable research units of UP Diliman include:[[Marine Science Institute]], [[National Institute of Geological Sciences]], [[National Institute of Physics]], [[National Institute of Molecular Biology and Biotechnology]]-Diliman, and the [[National Institute for Science and Mathematics Education Development]], which are all pioneers of science research and development in the Philippines.<ref name="updil upsys"/> Its athletic teams, called the [[UP Fighting Maroons|Fighting Maroons]], are members of the [[University Athletic Association of the Philippines]] (UAAP). while its cheerdance group, [[UP Pep Squad|Pep Squad]], represents the university in the [[UAAP Cheerdance Competition]].

==Campus==
[[File:UP Ikot.JPG|thumb|right|250px|The ''UP Ikot'' [[Jeepney]] Shuttle Service]]
UP Diliman has a total land area of 493 hectares.<ref name="history hectare"/> A relative percentage of this property is utilized by the university in the form of building infrastructures and research facilities. However, the remaining lands are unoccupied, forested areas, while others are used for development and as residential zone. The campus is subdivided into four areas: the university itself, the science and technology parks, the residence area (commonly called as Area 2) and [[barangay]] UP Campus.

The university occupies a large percentage of the whole campus area. On the other hand, science and technology parks use the eastern and western sides of the land. Area 2 is situated on the north side of the campus while barangay UP Campus stretches from the western area until Katipunan Avenue near [[Ateneo de Manila University]].

===The Oblation and Academic Oval===
[[File:UP Diliman Oblation statue 2010.jpg|thumb|right|250px|UP Diliman's Oblation statue as viewed from the University Avenue.]]
Coming from the Commonwealth Avenue in [[Quezon City]], UP Diliman is connected by a road named as University Avenue. The avenue stretches 800 meters where traffic enters the campus or going towards [[Carlos Garcia|C.P. Garcia]] St., which connects Commonwealth Avenue to Katipunan Avenue. At the end of University Avenue, the [[UP Oblation|Oblation]] Plaza of Diliman campus faces the road. Behind it, the main building fa<U+00E7>ade of the campus can be seen, the [[Manuel Quezon|Quezon]] Hall.
{{main|Oblation (University of the Philippines)}}
The '''[[Oblation]] statue''' ({{lang-tl|Pahinungod/Oblasyon}}) is the most iconic figure of the UP System. The statue was originally made by [[National Artist of the Philippines|National Artist]] [[Guillermo Tolentino|Guillermo E. Tolentino]] in 1935 in a collective effort by the students of the UP System.<ref name="michael tan"/> During the 40th anniversary of the University of the Philippines, the Oblation was transferred to Diliman campus as a symbol of transfer of administrative seat. The Oblation was originally naked and made of concrete and stands 3.5 meters in height.<ref name="michael tan">{{cite web|last=Tan|first=Michael|title=The Oblation|url=http://pinoykasi.homestead.com/files/2002articles/12192002_Oblation.htm|publisher=Pinoy Kasi!|accessdate=7 August 2010|date=19 December 2002}}</ref> To promote morality and censorship, UP President Jorge Bocobo suggested to put fig leaf to cover genitals.<ref name="upaagc">{{cite web|title=UP Oblation: History|url=http://upaagc.org/oblation.html|work=UP Alumni Association of Greater Chicago|accessdate=7 August 2010}}</ref> In 1950, the Board of Regents ordered the statue to be cast in bronze, which was furnished in [[Italy]] and was put into display in 1958.<ref>{{cite web|title=Oblation by Napoleon Abueva|url=http://www.oblation.com.ph/history.htm|accessdate=7 August 2010}}</ref>

Several replicas of Tolentino's Oblation statue were created during the creation of new UP campuses, some were made by the National Artist [[Napoleon Abueva]]. UP Diliman's Oblation statue located in the Oblation Plaza is also a concrete-made replica of Tolentino's. The original statue is now put on display on the third floor of the university's Main Library.<ref name="upaagc"/>

The main and largest road in the university is the '''Academic Oval''', sometimes known as '''Acad Oval'''. This road is composed of two joining avenues, the [[Manuel Roxas|Roxas]] and [[Sergio Osme<U+00F1>a|Osme<U+00F1>a]] Avenues. Having a total circumference of about 2.2 kilometers, the oval connects the rest of the colleges of the university from the main University Avenue. The avenue had its name from several colleges around the oval, namely College of Mass Communication, College of Music, College of Engineering, College of Law, School of Economics, College of Business Administration, College of Education, College of Social Sciences and Philosophy and School of Library and Information Studies. The oval also covers Quezon Hall, the UP Theater, National Engineering Center, Student Activity Center/Vinzons Hall, Center for International Studies and Jorge B. Vargas Museum.<ref name="acad oval">{{cite web|last=Villar|first=Eugene Alvin|title=U.P. Diliman Academic Oval|url=http://www.vistapinas.com/article/up-diliman-academic-oval|accessdate=7 August 2010|date=21 June 2006}}</ref> Additionally, the Academic Oval is planted with over 500 [[acacia]] and fire trees.<ref name="acad oval"/><ref>{{cite web|last=Martinez|first=Glenn|title=A Sunday Walk around U.P.

During the centennial celebration of UP System, UP President Emerlinda Roman rehabilitated the inner circle of the Academic Oval. The transformation included the paving of the inner Oval and creation of commemorative tiles around the walkway for an exchange of price. The efforts are collected and distributed to form the UP Diliman Faculty Development Fund.<ref>{{cite web|title=Do you love UP?  Then show it!|url=http://www.upd.edu.ph/~updinfo/whatsup/upcentennial2.htm|publisher=UP Centennial Commission|accessdate=7 August 2010}}</ref> On March 2008, however, the Academic Oval was turned into one-way in order to lessen traffic volume entering the university. According to Vice Chancellor for Community Affairs Cynthia Grace Gregorio, this policy also promotes to lower air pollution by creating biking lanes on the inner side of the circle.<ref>{{cite news|last=Bibe Jr.|first=Cenon|title=UP reroutes traffic |url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/inquirerheadlines/metro/view/20080329-127076/UP-reroutes-traffic|accessdate=7 August 2010|newspaper=Philippine Daily Inquirer|date=29 March 2008}}</ref>

===Carillon Tower===
[[File:University Carillon at the UP Campus in Diliman.jpg|thumb|left|200px|The UP Carillon Tower as seen from [[Ramon Magsaysay|Magsaysay]] Avenue near the UP Film Institute.]]
The only [[carillon]] tower in the [[Philippines]] and in [[Southeast Asia]] that is manually played by a [[clavier]] or a wooden keyboard, the '''UP Carillon''' towers about 130 feet tall.<ref name="Bells of Diliman ring again on Dec. 18 ">{{cite news|last=Aurelio|first=Julie|title=Bells of Diliman ring again on Dec. 18 |url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/inquirerheadlines/nation/view/20071216-107115/Bells_of_Diliman_ring_again_on_Dec_18|accessdate=8 August 2010|newspaper=Manila Bulletin|date=16 December 2007}}</ref> The UP Carillon was originally constructed in 1940 by [[National Artist of the Philippines|National Artist]] [[Juan Nakpil]], [[UP Diliman College of Music|Conservatory of Music]] director Ramon Tapales and [[President of the University of the Philippines|UP President]] Bienvenido Gonzales with an initial idea of building a concrete structure that may tower the grounds of the university.<ref name="For UP the bells toll">{{cite news|last=Santiago|first=Bettina|title=For UP the bells toll|url=http://www.mb.com.ph/node/54306|accessdate=8 August 2010|newspaper=Manila Bulletin|date=20 December 2007}}</ref> Several years later, on 1 August 1952, the tower was finished and dedicated as the UP Carillon. Forty-eight bells with four [[octave]]s were installed by the Dutch carilloneeur Adrian Antonisse, with the efforts laid by the UP Alumni Association.<ref name="For UP the bells toll"/> These bells were forged by Van Bergen Co. in [[Netherlands]] and the largest of the them weighs five tons, where the total cost of construction summed up to [[Philippine peso|PhP]] 200,000.<ref name="restoration">{{cite web|title=History of UP Carillon|url=http://www.upcarillon.org/history.html|work=The University of the Philippines Carillon Tower Restoration Project|accessdate=8 August 2010}}</ref>

Apart from playing the UP's anthem ''[[UP Naming Mahal]]'' (UP Beloved), the Carillon tuned many music such as the ''Magtanim ay Di Biro'' (Planting Rice, a Filipino folk song) and [[The Beatles]] sounds.<ref name="restoration"/> One of the most important tunings of the Carillon was when it played the [[socialism|socialist]] anthem ''[[The Internationale]]'' at the 1971 Diliman Commune.<ref name="Anthem for dedicated youth">{{cite news|last=Ordo<U+00F1>ez|first=Elmer|title=Anthem for dedicated youth|url=http://archives.manilatimes.net/national/2008/apr/05/yehey/opinion/20080405opi2.html|accessdate=8 August 2010|newspaper=Manila Times|date=5 April 2008}}</ref><ref name="The UP Carillon rings again ">{{cite news|last=Cervantes|first=Behn|title=The UP Carillon rings again |url=http://showbizandstyle.inquirer.net/entertainment/entertainment/view/20080112-111831/The_UP_Carillon_rings_again|accessdate=8 August 2010|newspaper=Manila Bulletn|date=12 January 2008}}</ref> During this time, UP students declared the university as a republic and as a separate entity from the Philippines.<ref name="tinig">{{cite web|last=Palatino|first=Mong|title=Pagbabalik-tanaw sa Diliman Commune|url=http://www.tinig.com/v26/v26mong.html|publisher=Tinig.com|accessdate=8 August 2010|language=Tagalog}} {{Google translation|en|tl|3=http://www.tinig.com/v26/v26mong.html}}</ref>

Due to age and rust, the Carillon ceased to play in 1981. In 1988, the last symphonies of ''UP Naming Mahal'' and ''Push On UP!'' (UP Diliman's athletic cheer) from the tower was played during the December's Lantern Parade. Since then, the Carillon was never tuned.<ref name="Bells of Diliman ring again on Dec. 18 "/> But as late as 2001, students say that they can hear the rhymes of ''[[London Bridge Is Falling Down]]'' and ''Sing a Song of Six Pence'' despite that it was closed to prevent further mishaps.<ref name="Bells of Diliman ring again on Dec. 18 "/>

In 2005, through the collective efforts of UP Alumni Association and various private donors, the UP Carillon Restoration Project of the UP Centennial Commission launched a fund-raising program to collect PhP 20 million to restore the Carillon, as a projection of using the tower again in the coming 100th year of the [[University of the Philippines]].<ref>{{cite web|title=History of UP Carillon|url=http://www.upcarillon.org/about_project.html|work=The University of the Philippines Carillon Tower Restoration Project|accessdate=8 August 2010}}</ref> After two years, the Project was able to collect PhP 14 million which will be used to cleanup and repair the tower itself and to replace the bells.<ref name="Restoring the UP Carillon<U+2019>s history ">{{cite news|last=de Guzman Jr.|first=Marcos|title=Restoring the UP Carillon<U+2019>s history |url=http://showbizandstyle.inquirer.net/lifestyle/lifestyle/view/20070609-70321/Restoring_the_UP_Carillon%92s_history|accessdate=8 August 2010|newspaper=Manila Bulletin|date=9 June 2007}}</ref>

In 2007, the Carillon was formally reintroduced to the public after two years of restoration. The original 48 bells were put into archives and are now replaced by 36 bells bought from [[Netherlands|Dutch]] company [[Petit & Fritsen|Petit and Fritsen]] for PhP 12 million whereas the construction engineers were provided by the Royal Bell Philippines. According to project engineer Matthew Bergers, each bell was made from 80% bronze and 20% combination of [[zinc]], [[magnesium]] and [[phosphorus]]. At the same time, the largest of these bells weighs 635 kilograms and the smallest weighs 14 kilograms.<ref name="Bells of Diliman ring again on Dec. 18 "/> The original wood claviers were replaced by heavy duty oakwood while all bells are designed to hold refurbished steel pipes.<ref name="Restoring the UP Carillon<U+2019>s history "/> Another project engineer Eduardo Otacan also said that the new bells will have 3 octaves and they can be programmed using computers attached to the clavier.<ref name="Bells of Diliman ring again on Dec. 18 "/>

At the same time, a small amphitheater named Carillon Plaza was constructed at the base of the tower. After about two decades of silence, the UP Carillon was heard again during the Lantern Parade of 2007.<ref name="Bells of Diliman ring again on Dec. 18 "/>

===Sunken Garden===
:''"Sunken Garden" redirects here. For other uses, see [[Sunken Gardens]].''
[[File:UP Diliman Sunken Garden.jpg|thumb|right|The Sunken Garden in UP Diliman.]]
The '''Gen. [[Antonio Luna]] Parade Grounds''', or commonly known as the '''Sunken Garden''', is a 5-hectare natural depression found on the eastern side of the campus and at the end of the Academic Oval circle. Sunken Garden is enclosed by the UP Diliman Main Library (also houses the School of Library and Information Studies), College of Social Sciences and Philosophy's Department of Psychology, College of Education, Student Activity Center/[[Wenceslao Vinzons|Vinzons]] Hall, College of Business Administration, School of Economics and College of Law. The Grounds was the original property of the UP-ROTC when Diliman campus was founded in 1949.<ref name="luna">{{cite web|title=General Antonio Luna Parade Grounds|url=http://www.uprotc.org/facility/gen-antonio-luna-parade-grounds.html|publisher=UP ROTC|accessdate=8 August 2010}}</ref>

Gen. Antonio Luna Parade Grounds acquired its name ''Sunken Garden'' due to its basin-shaped low-level formation that has the deepest point of 65 meters above sea level (contrary to university's height of over hundreds of meters above sea level).<ref name="The truth behind the myth">{{cite web|last=Sarmiento|first=Christine Joy|title=The truth behind the myth|url=http://dilimangenius.webs.com/maharlagmay.htm|work=UP College of Mass Communication|accessdate=8 August 2010}}</ref> The Sunken Garden is usually the venue for sports tournament like [[frisbee]], [[soccer]], and [[volleyball]] clinics as well as the annual UP Fair. Sometimes, [[Reserve Officers Training Corps|ROTC]] trainings are done here by the Department of Military Science and Tactics.<ref name="luna"/>

The Sunken Garden actually sinks by about two inches every year. There are two possible reasons of this sinking: first, it is because of underground trenches that mingle with the campus' sewer system. These trenches branch from the rear side of NIGS building, Sampaguita Residence Hall, the UP Integrated School, down to the National Institute of Physics, until near the former Narra Residence Hall. These trenches then connects to the so-called Marikina [[Fault (geology)|Fault Line]], an active geologic structure that runs across the east of [[Metro Manila]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Geologic Map of Diliman, Quezon City and the Marikina Fault Line|url=http://www.phivolcs.dost.gov.ph/images/active/Hazard%20Maps/Active%20Fault%20Maps/Valley_fault_maps/diliman_q.pdf|publisher=Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology|accessdate=8 August 2010}} {{Dead link|date=November 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref> Another theory is that the depression was due to the emptying of former streams in the Sunken Garden that is prominent in the 1950s. These streams formerly run from the Katipunan Avenue, going to the garden itself and leaves the campus for the Commonwealth Avenue.<ref name="The truth behind the myth"/>

Angara]], whose office was created in 26 April 1982.<ref>{{cite web|title=UP Diliman Faculty Manual|url=http://www.upv.edu.ph/downloads/files/UPD_Faculty_Manual.pdf|publisher=UP Diliman|accessdate=9 August 2010|page=3|year=2003}}</ref> The Chancellor is assisted by five Vice Chancellors &mdash; for Academic Affairs, Administration, Community Affairs, Research and Development and Student Affairs.<ref name="officials diliman">{{cite web|title=Officials of UP Campuses|url=http://www.upd.edu.ph/officials.htm#diliman|work=University of the Philippines|accessdate=5 August 2010}}</ref> The current chancellor is Dr. Caesar Saloma, who was appointed by the Board of Regents into position on its 1267th meeting, 2 March 2011.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.upd.edu.ph/~updinfo/index188.html|title=Saloma is new UPD Chancellor|publisher=UP Newsletter|accessdate=2011-03-02}}</ref>

Apart from heading the university, the Chancellor also holds administrative works that represents the Board of Regents to the campus level. The Chancellor is also the chairperson directing the University Council, an internal coordinating body that composed the Chancellor himself, the University Registrar as the secretary, and the professors, associate professors and assistant professors as members.<ref>{{cite web|title=UP Diliman Faculty Manual|url=http://www.upv.edu.ph/downloads/files/UPD_Faculty_Manual.pdf|publisher=UP Diliman|accessdate=9 August 2010|page=12|year=2003}}</ref> The Vice Chancellor for Academic Affairs, on the other hand, assists the Chancellor in coordinating curricular, instructional and library programs among others of the university. The Vice Chancellor for Administration assists the Chancellor in administrative management of the campus. Similarly, the Vice Chancellor for Community Affairs assists the Chancellor for promoting relationships with the university itself and the residents in-campus, the local government and safety. The Vice Chancellor for Research and Development assists the Chancellor for formulating guidelines and criteria for research and development of the university. Finally, the Vice Chancellor for Student Affairs assists the Chancellor for promoting wellness and discipline among students such as health and food services and scholarship management.<ref>{{cite web|title=UP Diliman Faculty Manual|url=http://www.upv.edu.ph/downloads/files/UPD_Faculty_Manual.pdf|publisher=UP Diliman|accessdate=9 August 2010|pages=8<U+2013>9|year=2003}}</ref>

===Colleges and institutes===
[[Image:MalcolmHall.jpg|thumb|right|The Malcolm Hall, named after the college's first dean, [[Supreme Court of the Philippines|Supreme Court]] [[Associate Justices of the Supreme Court of the Philippines|Justice]] [[George A. Malcolm|George Malcolm]] houses the [[University of the Philippines College of Law|College of Law]].]]
The academic arms of the university are called [[college]]s, [[institute]]s or [[school]]s. A number of colleges and schools offer undergraduate, graduate and diploma courses while some offer only a specific academic field. Most institutes offer no courses but provide research facilities for academic development.

Each college or school is headed by a single dean, who is appointed by the Board of Regents of the University of the Philippines upon the recommendation of the Chancellor and the President of UP themselves. The dean acts as the head of the faculty of his college and assumes administrative works assigned by the Board. The dean has tenure of three years, which, may be extended up to two terms upon reappointment. The associate dean, on the other hand, is the second head of a college/school and assists the dean for administration of the college/school. The tenure of the associate dean is determined by the Board of Regents upon the recommendation of the Chancellor and the dean of the college/school.<ref name="manual p 10">{{cite web|title=UP Diliman Faculty Manual|url=http://www.upv.edu.ph/downloads/files/UPD_Faculty_Manual.pdf|publisher=UP Diliman|accessdate=9 August 2010|page=10|year=2003}}</ref>

It must be noted that some of the colleges of UP Diliman assumes the title of "Institute" (such as Asian Institute of Tourism) and thus consists of departments. It must also be noted that colleges of UP Diliman contains institute (such as Institute of Civil Engineering of College of Engineering). Some colleges also use the title "School" (such as School of Economics) and thus consists of departments. In summary, a college may be composed of departments and institutes (or national institutes) and a school may also contains both. An institute, on the other hand, may be under a college or school, or a standalone research institute (such as the Institute of Islamic Studies).

An institute is headed by the institute director, who also assumes the duties represented by the Chancellor to his department. The director has a tenure of three years, which may be extended up to two terms upon the reappointment of the Chancellor. A director should not be an academic head of any department or division under his institute. Each college/school is composed of clusters of departments or institutes. Most academic programs are offered by the departments/institutes. A department is headed by the department chair, who assumes the duties represented by the dean and Chancellor to his department. The chair is appointed by the Chancellor, as recommended by the dean or institute director, and a tenure of three years which may be extended up to two terms upon reappointment.<ref name="manual p 10"/>

However, some units of the university are named as ''national institute'', such as the National Institute of Molecular Biology and Biotechnnology. The status of being an institute is determined by the Board of Regents, but being a national institute is required by Philippine legislation.<ref name="EO 889">{{cite web|title=Executive Order 889: Establishing a System of National Centers of Excellence in the Basic Sciences|url=http://www.lawphil.net/executive/execord/eo1983/eo_889_1983.html|accessdate=9 August 2010|author=[[Ferdinand Marcos]]|date=23 March 1983|quote=The Board of Regents of the University of the Philippines is hereby authorized to organize the abovementioned institutes, and such other additional institutes and laboratories in the future it may deem proper to create, from out of the existing staff, physical facilities and programs of the University and its constituent units.}}</ref> The head of a national institute, also the director, is not appointed by the Chancellor but by the President of the University of the Philippines instead.<ref name="manual p 10">{{cite web|title=UP Diliman Faculty Manual|url=http://www.upv.edu.ph/downloads/files/UPD_Faculty_Manual.pdf|publisher=UP Diliman|accessdate=9 August 2010|pages=10|year=2003}}</ref>

The university is composed of 26 colleges, schools and institutes. Officially, these are called ''degree-granting units''.<ref name="diliman colleges">{{cite web|title=Academic Programs|url=http://www.upd.edu.ph/acad.htm|work=UP Diliman|accessdate=7 August 2010}}</ref> The oldest of these colleges is the [[UP Diliman College of Fine Arts|College of Fine Arts]], established in 1908 and originally located in Manila.<ref name="fine arts history">{{cite web|title=About CFA: Celebrating 100 years in 2008|url=http://up-cfa.com/the-college/|work=UP College of Fine Arts|accessdate=7 August 2010}}</ref> On the other hand, the first college to operate in the Diliman campus is the [[UP Diliman College of Music|Conservatory of Music]] (then College of Music) in 1949.

== Culture, sports and traditions ==
The Diliman community is sometimes referred to as ''the Diliman Republic'' and a "microcosm of the Philippines". It is the only university in [[Metro Manila]] that has its own [[jeepney]] transportation system due to its expansiveness. The university also has a congressional franchise to operate two radio stations (AM and FM) as well as a television station. Currently, the university only operates [[DZUP 1602]], a community AM radio station. The campus encompasses a number of residential areas and many students claim a sense of solidarity with the residents of these immediate communities.

U.P. Diliman represents the U.P. System in the [[University Athletic Association of the Philippines]] (UAAP) and participates in all events. The [[Fighting Maroons]] have perennially placed in the top three in the overall points race of the UAAP. 

Two of the most-awaited events in the campus are the Lantern Parade, held on the last week before the [[Christmas]] break, and the U.P. Fair, held every February. During the Lantern Parade, groups within the University create Christmas lanterns and floats and parade around the Academic Oval. The U.P. Fair, organized by the [[UP Diliman University Student Council]], is a week-long event held at the Sunken Garden that features nightly music concerts, booths, and amusement park rides.

==Centennial Celebration==
[[Image:fireworks10.jpg|thumb|right|Fireworks display at UP Diliman's Centennial Kick-off Celebration.]]
On January 8, 2008, the [[University of the Philippines System]] (UP), with 7 constituent universities and 12 campuses offering 258 undergraduate and 438 graduate programs, began its centennial celebration at the Diliman campus. The university has produced 7 of 14 presidents, 12 chief justices of the Supreme Court, 34 of 35 national scientists and 36 of 57 national artists, and an estimated 250,000 alumni (15,000 doctors, 8,000 lawyers and 23,000 teachers).<ref>[http://opinion.inquirer.net/inquireropinion/editorial/view_article.php?article_id=110945  Inquirer.net, UP in next 100 years]</ref> 

Fernando Javier, 100, of  [[Baguio City]], oldest UP [[alumnus]] ([[Civil Engineering]] from [[University of the Philippines Manila]], 1933), carried the 100-torch relay at the UP academic oval in [[Diliman]], [[Quezon City]]. The 99th torchbearer was Michael Reuben Dumlao, youngest, a 6th-grader from the [[University of the Philippines Integrated School]] in UP Diliman. UP president Emerlinda Roman, first woman president, carried the 100th torch and ignited the centennial [[cauldron]] in the UP [[Oblation]].<ref>[http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/inquirerheadlines/nation/view/20080106-110642/UP_passes_torch_100-yr-old_to_6th_grader  Inquirer.net, UP passes torch: 100-yr-old to 6th grader]</ref>
