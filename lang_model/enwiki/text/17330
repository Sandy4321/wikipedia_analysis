Born in [[New York City]], he spent much of his early childhood in [[Bogot<U+00E1>]], [[Colombia]] before moving back to the [[United States]] at the age of 12. In his youth, Williamson developed an interest in [[comic strips]], particularly [[Alex Raymond]]'s ''[[Flash Gordon]]''. He took art classes at [[Burne Hogarth]]'s [[Cartoonists and Illustrators School]], there befriending future cartoonists [[Wally Wood]] and [[Roy Krenkel]], who introduced him to the work of illustrators who had influenced adventure strips. Before long, he was working professionally in the comics industry. His most notable works include his [[science-fiction]]/[[heroic fantasy]] art for [[EC Comics]] in the 1950s, on titles including ''[[Weird Science (comic)|Weird Science]]'' and ''[[Weird Fantasy]]''.

In the 1960s, he gained recognition for continuing Raymond's illustrative tradition with his work on the ''Flash Gordon'' comic-book series, and was a seminal contributor to the [[Warren Publishing]]'s black-and-white [[horror comics]] magazines ''[[Creepy]]'' and ''[[Eerie]]''. Williamson spent most of the 1970s working on his own credited strip, another Raymond creation, ''[[Secret Agent X-9]]''. The following decade, he became known for his work adapting ''[[Star Wars]]'' films to comic books and newspaper strips. From the mid-1980s to 2003, he was primarily active as an [[inker]], mainly on [[Marvel Comics]] [[superhero]] titles starring such characters as [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics)|Daredevil]], [[Spider-Man]], and [[Spider-Girl]].

Williamson is known for his collaborations with a group of artists including [[Frank Frazetta]], [[Roy Krenkel]], [[Angelo Torres]], and [[George Woodbridge]], which was affectionately known as the "Fleagle Gang". Williamson has been cited as a stylistic influence on a number of younger artists, and encouraged many, helping such newcomers as [[Berni Wrightson]] and [[Mike Kaluta]] break into the business. He has won several industry awards, and six career-retrospective books about him have been published since 1998. Living in Pennsylvania with his wife Corina, Williamson retired in his seventies.

Williamson was inducted into the [[List of Eisner Award winners#The Will Eisner Award Hall of Fame|Will Eisner Comic Book Hall of Fame]] in 2000.

==Biography==

===Early life and career===
Al Williamson was born in [[Manhattan]], [[New York City]], [[New York]],<ref name=nytobit /> one of two children of Sally and Alfonso Williamson, who was of [[Scottish people|Scottish]] descent and a [[Colombia]]n citizen. The family relocated to [[Bogot<U+00E1>]], Colombia, when Al was two years old.<ref name=vanhise15>Van Hise, James. ''The Art of Al Williamson''. (San Diego: Blue Dolphin, 1983) ISBN 0-943128-04-8, p. 15</ref> "My father was Colombian and my mother was American," Williamson said in 1997. "They met in the States, got married and went down there. I grew up down there so I learned both English and Spanish at the same time. It was comic books that taught me to read both languages."<ref name=jkc15p16>"Interview with Al Williamson," ''The Jack Kirby Collector'' #15 (April 1997), p. 16. Reprinted in ''The Collected Jack Kirby Collector Volume Three'' ([[TwoMorrows Publishing]],  1999), p. 142. ISBN 978-1-893905-02-3</ref> At age nine, Williamson took an interest in comic strips via the [[Mexico|Mexican]] magazine ''Paquin'', which featured American strips as well as ''Underwater Empire'' by [[Argentina|Argentine]] [[cartoonist]] [[Carlos Clemen]]. Later, Williamson was attracted to [[Alex Raymond]]'s [[Flash Gordon]] strip after his mother took him to see the ''[[Flash Gordon Conquers the Universe]]'' movie serial.<ref name=hurd31>Hurd, Jud, "The Al Williamson Story", ''Cartoonist Profiles'' #3 (Summer 1969), p.31</ref> While living in Bogot<U+00E1> he met future cartoonist Adolfo Buylla, who befriended him and gave him artistic advice.<ref>Schultz, Mark (contributor). ''Al Williamson: Hidden Lands'' (anthology) [[Milwaukie, Oregon]]: [[Dark Horse Comics|Dark Horse Books]], 2004, p. 15. ISBN 1-56971-816-4.</ref> At age 12, in 1943, Williamson moved with his mother to [[San Francisco, California|San Francisco]], [[California]]; they later moved to New York.<ref name=vanhise15 /><ref>Schultz, ''Al Williamson: Hidden Lands'', pp. 11-15</ref>
[[Image:AlWilliamsonearly.jpg|alt=Drawing of a young man looking intently into the eyes of a smiling young woman while holding her hand.|thumb|left|Late 1940s sketch]]   
In the mid-1940s Williamson continued to pursue his interest in cartooning and began to take art classes with ''[[Tarzan]]'' cartoonist [[Burne Hogarth]], and later at Hogarth's [[Cartoonists and Illustrators School]]. There he met future cartoonists [[Wally Wood]] and [[Roy Krenkel]]. According to Williamson, "Roy broadened my collecting horizons, he became my guide to all the great illustrators <U+2014> the artists who directly influenced adventure cartoonists like [Alex] Raymond and [[Hal Foster|[Hal] Foster]]. He showed me [[Joseph Clement Coll|J.C. Coll]], [[Franklin Booth]], [[Joseph Franke]], [[Dan Smith (artist)|Dan Smith]], [[Norman Lindsay]], [[Fortunino Matania]], and the great [[Blue Book (magazine)|Blue Book]] illustrators like [[Herbert Morton Stoops]] and [[Frank Hoban]]."<ref>Schultz, ''Al Williamson: Hidden Lands'', p. 20</ref> As he continued to learn about the cartooning field, he would visit the comic-book publisher [[Fiction House]], meeting such artists as [[George Evans (comics)|George Evans]], [[Bob Lubbers]], [[John Celardo]], and [[Mort Meskin]].<ref>Morrow, Jon. "Interview with Al Williamson", ''The Jack Kirby Collector'' #15 (April 1987), p. 17</ref>

Williamson's first professional work may have been helping Hogarth pencil some ''Tarzan'' Sunday pages in 1948,<ref>Schultz, ''Al Williamson: Hidden Lands'', pp. 19-20</ref> although Williamson, who had initially believed so, reconsidered in a 1983 interview and recalled that his ''Tarzan'' work had come after his first two pieces of comic-book art: providing spot illustrations for the story "The Ugliest Horse in the World" in an unspecified issue of [[Eastern Color]]'s seminal series ''[[Famous Funnies]]'',<ref name=vanhise18>Van Hise, ''The Art of Al Williamson'', p. 18. No story of this title appears in [[Grand Comics Database]].</ref> and a two-page [[Boy Scout]]s story, his first comics narrative, in ''New Heroic Comics'' #51 (Nov. 1948).<ref name=vanhise18 /><ref>Strauss, Robert, "Flourishing with the Genre" in Van Hise, p. 7</ref><ref name=gcd>[http://www.comics.org/credit/name/Al%20Williamson/sort/chrono/ Al Williamson] at Grand Comics Database</ref> (Williamson is also identified as co-penciler, with [[Frank Frazetta]], of a three-page crime story, "The Last Three Dimes", in [[Nedor Comics|Standard Comics]]' ''Wonder Comics'' #20 [Oct. 1948])<ref name=gcd /> Williamson explained that while Hogarth had offered him ''Tarzan'' work, Williamson "just couldn't do it. ... I couldn't get it into my little brain that he wanted me to do it exactly the way that he did it," and instead successfully recommended Celardo, artist of the [[Tarzanesque|Tarzan-like]] feature "Ka'a'nga" in Fiction House's ''Jungle Comics''.<ref name=vanhise18 /> As Williamson recalled:
{{blockquote|...Hogarth got in touch with [Celardo], and the next thing you knew, he was penciling the Sunday page for him. He did it for quite some time and something must have happened ... but at that point I was going to the Hogarth school again in the evenings ... and he asked me again if I would like to give it a try, so I said OK. He gave me a page and he had already laid it out, so I just tightened it up. Then he gave me another page that I tightened up and he inked it. Then I said I'd like to try laying it out myself and asked if I could do that, and he said, 'Go ahead, Al,' and handed me the script. So I laid that page out on a sketchpad. He said fine and just made a couple of suggestions as to what I should do; then I just did it on the big Sunday page, and when I was through, he inked it and the other one I had done the same way, and that was it.<ref name=vanhise18-19>Van Hise, ''The Art of Al Williamson'', pp. 18-19</ref>}}

During this period Williamson met his main stylistic influence, Raymond: "I had just turned 18. I had been in the business about six months or so. He gave me about two hours."<ref>Roberts, T. (contributor). ''Al Williamson: Hidden Lands'', p. 31</ref>

===1950s===
From 1949 to 1951, Williamson worked on [[science-fiction]] and [[Western comics|Western]] stories for publishers such as [[American Comics Group]] (AGC), [[Avon (publishers)|Avon Publications]], [[Fawcett Comics]], [[Nedor Comics|Standard Comics]], and, possibly, [[Toby Press]].<ref name=gcd /> He began collaborating with [[Frank Frazetta]], who often inked his work; and with [[Roy Krenkel]], who often did backgrounds.<ref>Ringgenberg, Steve (contributor). ''Al Williamson: Hidden Lands'', pp. 23&ndash;35</ref> Examples of his work from that period include "Chief Victorio's Last Stand", in Avon's ''Chief Victorio's Apache Massacre'' (no number, no month, 1951); "Death in Deep Space", in [[Magazine Enterprises]]' ''Jet'' #4 (no month, 1951); and "Skull of the Sorcerer", in ACG's ''[[Forbidden Worlds]]'' #3 (Dec. 1951), inked by [[Wally Wood]]<ref name=gcd /><ref>Williamson, in Van Hise, p. 19, credits the inking on "Skull of the Sorcerer" to Wood, [[Joe Orlando]], [[Frank Frazetta]]. and himself.</ref>

In 1952, upon the suggestion of artists Wally Wood and [[Joe Orlando]],<ref>Spurlock, David. ''Wally Wood Sketchbook''. (Lebanon, NJ: Vanguard Productions, 1998) p. 103</ref> Williamson began working for [[EC Comics]], an influential comic book company with a reputation for quality artists.<ref>Ringgenberg, ''Al Williamson: Hidden Lands'', pp. 76&ndash;77</ref> While at EC, Williamson frequently collaborated with fellow artists [[Frank Frazetta]], [[Roy Krenkel]] and [[Angelo Torres]], a group which, along with [[Nick Meglin]] and [[George Woodbridge]], became affectionately known as the "Fleagle Gang", named after a notorious criminal gang.<ref>Ringgenberg, ''Al Williamson: Hidden Lands'', p. 50</ref>  Williamson primarily worked on EC's science fiction comics ''[[Weird Science (comic)|Weird Science]]'', ''[[Weird Fantasy]]'', and ''[[Weird Science-Fantasy]]'', illustrating both original stories, primarily by writer [[Al Feldstein]], and adaptations of stories by authors such as [[Ray Bradbury]]<ref>For example, "A Sound of Thunder" in ''Weird Science-Fantasy'' #25(Sept. 1954,)</ref> and [[Harlan Ellison]],<ref>For example, "Upheaval", an adaptation of Ellison's "Mealtime", in ''Weird Science-Fantasy'' #24 (June 1954). It was Ellison's first comic book work: [http://www.sequentialellison.com/bibliography/?p=35 Sequential Ellison: ''Weird Science-Fantasy'' #24]</ref> but his work occasionally appeared in EC's [[horror fiction|horror]] and [[crime comics]] as well.

Williamson worked at EC through 1956 until the cancellation of most of the company's line. Williamson's EC art has been lauded for its illustrative flamboyance, evident in such stories as "I, Rocket", in ''Weird Fantasy'' #20 (Aug. 1953), co-penciled and co-inked with [[Frank Frazetta]]; and "50 Girls 50", in ''Weird Science'' #20 (Aug. 1953), co-inked by Williamson and Frazetta.<ref name=gcd /><ref>Strauss, in Van Hise pp. 9&ndash;10, singles out "I, Rocket" and "50 Girls 50" as stylistic breakthroughs.</ref> His final published EC story was the 10-page "A Question of Time", in ''[[Shock Illustrated]]'' #2 (Feb. 1956) with partial inking by Torres, who put his initials on last page.<ref name=gcd />

From 1955 to 1957, Williamson produced over 400 pages of three- to five-page stories for [[Atlas Comics (1950s)|Atlas Comics]], the 1950s forerunner of [[Marvel Comics]], working in various genres but primarily [[Western comics|Westerns]]. He continued to collaborate with Torres and Krenkel, as well as with [[Gray Morrow]], [[George Woodbridge]] and Ralph Mayo.<ref name="Yeates, T. 2004">Yeates, Thomas (contributor). ''Al Williamson: Hidden Lands'', pp. 81&ndash;84</ref> With Mayo, one of the first editors to give Williamson work, at [[Nedor Comics|Standard Comics]], Williamson collaborated on the [[Jungle girl (stock character)|jungle girl]] series ''[[Jann of the Jungle]]'' #16&ndash;17 (April & June 1957). Following Mayo's death, Williamson drew stories solo for the planned #18, but the series was abruptly canceled before that issue could be published.<ref>Yeates, ''Al Williamson: Hidden Lands'', pp. 147&ndash;153</ref> His "prolific though somewhat uneven two-year stint at Atlas",<ref name=strauss11-12>Strauss, pp. 11&ndash;12</ref> where he first drew [[war comics]], yielded superlative art in such stories as "The City That Time Forgot", in ''[[Marvel Tales]]'' #144 (March 1956); "Menace from the Stars", in ''[[Mystery Tales]]'' #44 (Aug. 1956); "The Unknown Ones", in ''Astonishing'' #57 (Jan. 1957); "Dreadnaught", in ''Navy Tales'' #2 (March 1957); and "Helpless", in ''Battle'' #55 (Nov. 1957).<ref name=gcd /><ref name=strauss11-12 /><ref>[http://www.atlastales.com/cr/131/n:131:z:a:o:4:d:ASC:p:1 Atlas Tales: Al Williamson credits]</ref> While "something appeared to be missing from a lot of his Atlas work: enthusiasm," Williamson's Atlas Westerns, at least, "form a strongly consistent body of work, characterized by minimal to nonexistent action, a preponderance of closeups and reaction shots, and well-defined figures set against sparse backgrounds."<ref name=strauss11-12 />

From 1958 to 1959 Williamson worked for [[Harvey Comics]] collaborating with former EC artists [[Reed Crandall]], Torres and Krenkel and inking the pencils of [[Jack Kirby]] (for ''Race to the Moon'' #2&ndash;3 and ''Blast-Off'' #1).  On inking Kirby, Williamson relates: "I remember going up to Harvey and getting work there. They said, 'We haven't got any work for you, but we have some stories here that Jack penciled. Do you want to ink them?' I'd never really inked anybody else before, but I said, 'Sure,' because I looked at the stuff, and thought, I can follow ''this'', it's all there. I inked it and they liked it, and they gave me three or four stories to do."<ref>Morrow, Jon. "Interview with Al Williamson", ''The Jack Kirby Collector'' #15 (April 1987), p. 18</ref> 
It was at Harvey Comics that writer [[Archie Goodwin (comics)|Archie Goodwin]], upon Williamson's recommendation, landed his first comic-book writing job.<ref>Feduniewicz, K., and Thomas Yeates (contributors). ''Al Williamson: Hidden Lands'', p. 194</ref> Goodwin would collaborate with Williamson on several projects over the next few decades.

Additionally, Williamson drew stories for ''[[Classics Illustrated]]'' (in collaboration with Crandall and Woodbridge); Westerns for [[Dell Comics]] (including ''Gunsmoke'' #8&ndash;12) and [[Charlton Comics]], including two complete issues of the Cheyenne Kid, (#10&ndash;11) with Angelo Torres, and science-fiction stories for ACG (including "The Vortex", in ''[[Forbidden Worlds]]'' #69 (1958).<ref name="Yeates, T. 2004" /> He also worked with former EC artist [[John Severin]] on the "American Eagle" feature in ''Prize Comics Western'' #109 and 113 (1955).

Williamson's work during this decade was his most prolific in terms of comic book work and has garnered considerable praise for its high quality.<ref>Strauss, p. 13</ref> He has been noted for his perfectionism and love for the medium.<ref>Barlow, R.(1972) ''EC Lives!''. E.C. Fan-Addict Club: New York, p. 33</ref> Despite its high reputation, it has been remarked that his artwork of this period can at times be uneven and uninspired.<ref>Ringgenberg, ''Al Williamson: Hidden Lands'', pp. 46&ndash;48</ref> Williamson was single during this period and was said to have a bohemian and undisciplined lifestyle.<ref name=vanhise45>Van Hise, ''The Art of Al Williamson'', p. 45</ref>

===1960s===
In 1960, with little work to be found in the comic book field due to a downturn in the industry, he went to work as an assistant to [[John Prentice (cartoonist)|John Prentice]] on the Alex Raymond-created comic strip ''[[Rip Kirby]]'' for a three-year period.<ref name="Yeates, T. 2004" /> According to Williamson: "The reason that I was called in to help him out was that John had decided to go to Mexico and Mac <nowiki>[</nowiki>[[Al McWilliams]]<nowiki>]</nowiki>, John's prior assistant, didn't want to go... The deal was: would I be willing to go to Mexico?... and I said 'Si!'..."<ref>Feduniewicz, K. & Yeates,T., 'Williamson conquers the universe! ,''Third Rail'' #1 (June 1981), p.3</ref> It proved to be a solid learning period for Williamson, as he credits Prentice with teaching him many fundamental illustration methods.<ref>Van Hise, ''The Art of Al Williamson'', 30</ref> According to Prentice: "...he was terrific. He's the best guy I ever had by far."<ref>Van Hise, ''The Art of Al Williamson'', p. 65</ref> During that time, Williamson also assisted [[John Cullen Murphy]] on the ''[[Big Ben Bolt]]'' boxing strip and [[Don Sherwood]] on the strip ''[[Dan Flagg]]''.<ref>Hurd, p. 32</ref> He also produced some sample pages for a proposed [[Sunday strip]] version of ''[[Modesty Blaise]]''.<ref>{{cite web | url= http://profmendez.tripod.com/html/modesty3a.htm |title=Madame X: Peter O'Donnell and Jim Holdaway's Modesty Blaise |accessdate=2009-11-04 |first=A.

He returned to comics in 1965 doing one story each in [[Gold Key Comics]]' ''[[Ripley's Believe It or Not]]'' #1 (June 1965), ''[[The Twilight Zone]]'' #12 (Aug. 1965), and ''[[Boris Karloff]] Tales of Mystery'' #11 (Sept. 1965), and helped launch [[Warren Publishing]]'s black-and-white horror-comics magazines ''[[Creepy]]'' and ''[[Eerie]]'' with several stories in early issue, while also contributing to Warren's [[war comics]] magazine ''[[Blazing Combat]]''. He was instrumental in recruiting other former [[EC Comics]] artists as Frazetta, Krenkel, Torres, Crandall, and Evans, as well as artist [[Gray Morrow]] and writer-editor [[Archie Goodwin (comics)|Archie Goodwin]].<ref>Goodwin, Archie, "The Black & White World of Warren Publications", ''[[Comic Book Artist]]'' #4 (Spring 1999), p.9</ref>

In 1966, he drew the first issue (Sept. 1966) of a new ''[[Flash Gordon]]'' comic book series, published by [[King Features]]. Williamson's work received positive reader response, and returned to draw issues #4&ndash;5 (March & May 1967), as well as the cover of #3 (Jan. 1967). Williamson received a [[National Cartoonist Society]] Best Comic Book art award for his work on that title.<ref>Ringenberg, Steve. "Al Williamson Interviewed", ''The Comics Journal'' #90 (May 1984), p. 78</ref> In 1967, on the strength of a backup feature he had done in the Flash Gordon book, he took over another Alex Raymond creation, the long-running ''[[Secret Agent X-9]]'' comic strip, collaborating with writer Goodwin.  At the start of their tenure, the title was changed to ''Secret Agent Corrigan''.<ref>Riggenberg, "Al Williamson Interviewed", p. 80</ref>

Williamson also helped assemble the first major book on Alex Raymond's ''Flash Gordon'', published by [[Woody Gelman|Nostalgia Press]] in 1967, and wrote the introduction.<ref>Ringgenberg, "Al Williamson Interviewed", p. 88</ref> In 1969, [[Wally Wood]]'s alternative-press comic book ''[[witzend]]'' #1 published Williamson's "Savage World", a 1956 story originally drawn for a [[Buster Crabbe]] comic book that had been cancelled.  With significant contributions by Frazetta, Krenkel, and Torres, the story is a prime sample of the "Fleagle Gang" style and has since been reprinted by [[Marvel Comics]] (in the black-and-white comics magazine ''Unknown Worlds of Science Fiction'' #1, January 1975), [[Pacific Comics]] and [[Kitchen Sink Press]].<ref>Schreiner, Dave. "Savage World", ''Death Rattle''  vol. 2, #10 (April 1987) pp. 22&ndash;23</ref> Wood would later write the script for a three-page story drawn by Williamson, "The Tube", in another alternative-press comic, publisher [[Flo Steinberg]]'s ''[[Big Apple Comix]]'' (1975).

By the end of the decade, Williamson was beginning to encourage younger artists whom he would meet at [[comic book conventions]], helping [[Bernie Wrightson]] to break into the business.<ref>{{cite journal | url = http://www.twomorrows.com/comicbookartist/articles/05wrightson.html | title = Like a Bat Out of Hell: Chatting with Bernie Wrightson, DC's Monster Maker | work = [[Comic Book Artist]] | publisher = [[Two Morrows Publishing]] | issue=5 |date= Summer 1999 | archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/5sq0rQnS4 | archivedate= September 18, 2010 | deadurl=no}}</ref>

Williamson worked on ''Secret Agent Corrigan'' through the 1970s until he left the strip in 1980. The first Corrigan anthology was published in France in 1975, ''Le FBI joue et gagne'', reprinting Williamson's first episode on the feature.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bedetheque.com/album-20662-BD-Le-FBI-joue-et-gagne.html |title=Corrigan - Agent Secret X-9 |accessdate=2009-05-04 |publisher=Bedetheque}}</ref>  He returned to [[Warren Publishing]] in 1976 and again in 1979 to draw three additional stories in ''[[Creepy]]'' (s 83, 86, 112). These were published in France in the collection ''Al Williamson: A la fin de l'envoi'' in 1981.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bedetheque.com/serie-5199-BD-A-la-fin-de-l-envoi.html|title=A la fin de l'envoi |accessdate=2009-04-18 |publisher=Bedetheque}}</ref>

He drew a few more stories for [[Gold Key Comics]], in ''Grimm's Ghost Stories'' #5 & 8 (Aug. 1972, March 1973), and ''[[The Twilight Zone]]'' #51 (Aug. 1973), as well two mystery stories for [[DC Comics]], in ''The Witching Hour'' #14 (May 1971), with inker [[Carlos Garzon]], and ''[[House of Mystery]]'' #185 (April 1970), with [[Mike Kaluta]], another artist whom he helped break into the field, assisting him.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kaluta.com/pages/bio/intvwcba.html|title=Comic Book Artist Interview |accessdate=2009-05-06 |publisher=Kaluta.com}}</ref> He also drew various Flash Gordon illustrations.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://home.comcast.net/~cjh5801a/Flash_williamson.htm|title=Flash Gordon Commercial Art |accessdate=2009-04-18 |publisher=The Holloway Pages| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20090412025338/http://home.comcast.net/~cjh5801a/Flash_williamson.htm| archivedate= 12 April 2009 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> In the burgeoning fan movement, Williamson became an early subject of comics historians with the publication of Jim Vadebonceour's ''Al Williamson: His Works'' in 1971<ref>Vadeboncoeur, Jim.

===1980s===
After leaving the Secret Agent Corrigan daily strip, he illustrated ''[[The Empire Strikes Back]]'' for [[Marvel Comics|Marvel]]'s ''[[Star Wars]]'' movie adaptations (with Carlos Garzon), as well as the 50th issue of the monthly ''Star Wars'' comic. Williamson was [[Lucasfilms]]' first choice as illustrator for the ''Star Wars'' newspaper [[comic strip]], a project Williamson had been offered years earlier but had declined to take on at the time. He was offered the ''Empire Strikes Back'' adaptation upon Lucasfilm's specific request, as [[George Lucas]] had an appreciation of Williamson's EC Comics and Flash Gordon work.<ref>Van Hise, ''The Art of Al Williamson'', p. 36</ref> Writer Archie Goodwin cited "the comfort of knowing that I would be working with Al Williamson, an old friend that I've worked with over the years. He was absolutely the best ''Star Wars'' artist you could ever want to have. That makes it easier because you feel that whatever you do as a writer, you have an artist that will make it look great. He's also an artist that Lucasfilm kind of begged and pleaded for and always wanted to have do ''Star Wars'' material. There was that comfort factor in it as well."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.echostation.com/interview/goodwin.htm|title=Another ''Star Wars'' Classic: Writer/Editor Archie Goodwin | date=June 9, 1996| author=Morrow, Jim, interview with Goodwin|accessdate=2009-04-18 |publisher=Echo Station}}</ref>

A comic book adaptation of the [[Dino De Laurentiis]]' [[film]], ''[[Flash Gordon (film)|Flash Gordon]],'' written by Bruce Jones and illustrated by Al Williamson, was released by Western Publishing in both hardcover and softcover formats to coincide with the film's release. A photograph of actor Sam J. Jones, who played Flash Gordon, was pasted into the original cover art. It was serialized in three issues of Whitman's Flash Gordon comic book, #31-33, March<U+2013>May, 1981. Alden McWilliams inked the backgrounds for the last 25 pages.  According to Williamson, "It was the hardest job I ever had to do in my life."<ref>Riggenberg, "Al Williamson Interviewed", p. 77</ref> He then began drawing the ''[[Star Wars]]'' comic strip following [[Alfredo Alcala]]'s tenure, with Goodwin writing.  He drew the daily and Sunday feature until 1983, when the strip was canceled.  Williamson's daily strips on this series were completely reprinted in Russ Cochran's three-volume slipcase edition in 1991.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.timelineuniverse.net/CoverGalleries/CovergalleryClassic2.htm|title=Classic Star Wars |accessdate=2009-04-18 |publisher=Time Line Universe}}</ref>

Returning to comic books full-time for the first time since 1959, Williamson began work for [[Pacific Comics]], collaborating with writer [[Bruce Jones (comics)|Bruce Jones]] for the ''Alien Worlds'' title (#1, 4, 8), and "Cliff Hanger", a six-issue adventure-strip backup feature in the ''Somerset Holmes'' [[miniseries]]. For Marvel, he illustrated the ''[[A Marvel Comics Super Special: Blade Runner|Blade Runner]]'' and ''[[Return of the Jedi]]'' movie adaptations.  The two Archie Goodwin stories he illustrated for ''[[Epic Illustrated]]'' ("Relic" in issue #27, 1984; and "Out of Phase", in #34, 1986) have been considered to be some of his finest work.<ref>Wheatley, Mark (contributor). ''Al Williamson Adventures'' (anthology) (Insight Studios Group: [[Westminster, Maryland]], 2003) ISBN 1-889317-17-9. Preface</ref> He drew a short story for ''Time Spirits'' #4 and the full issue of ''Star Wars'' #98. For [[DC Comics]], he penciled and inked an eight-page story by [[Elliot S. Maggin]] for ''[[Superman]]'' #400 (Oct. 1984) and he inked [[Rick Veitch]] on the classic, oft reprinted [[Alan Moore]] [[Superman]]/[[Swamp Thing]] story "The Jungle Line" in [[DC Comics Presents]] #85 (Sept. 1985).

In the mid-1980s, Williamson made a successful transition to becoming strictly an [[inker]], beginning with DC Comics (inking [[Curt Swan]] on ''Superman'' #408&ndash;416) and moving to Marvel where he inked such pencillers such as [[John Romita Jr.]], [[Gene Colan]], [[John Buscema]], [[Rick Leonardi]], [[Pat Oliffe]], [[Mike Mignola]], [[Lee Weeks]], and many others.  [[John Romita, Sr.]], Marvel's [[art director]] during that time, considered Williamson to be "one of the best pencillers in the world but he really can't make a living at penciling because he wants to do these beautifully pencilled pages with ample time to do them. That's why Al is inking now ... and adding a greater dimension to the penciller he's working with."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jimkeefe.com/studio/romita/interview.htm|first = Jim | last=Keefe| title=Interview: John Romita |accessdate=2009-04-18 |publisher=JimKeefe.com}}</ref> He won nine industry awards for Best Inker between 1988 and 1997.

===1990s===

In the background looms a monster and an ape figure, while some spaceships fly by in a starry sky.|thumb|Williamson promotional art for cover of [[Dark Horse Comics]]' ''Classic Star Wars: [[Han Solo]] at Star's End'' (1997)]]  
Williamson provided the covers and additional artwork for [[Dark Horse Comics]]' 20-issue ''Classic Star Wars'' (Aug. 1992 &ndash; June 1994), which reprinted of his ''[[Star Wars]]'' daily strips. He later inked the ''Star Wars: [[The Phantom Menace]]'' and ''[[Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope|A New Hope]]'' film adaptations for the company.  Through 2003, he was active as inker on several [[Marvel Comics]] titles, including [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics)|''Daredevil'']] (#248&ndash;300), ''[[Spider-Man 2099]]'' (#1&ndash;25), and ''[[Spider-Girl]]'' (#1&ndash;61), and such non-superhero projects as the four-issue Marvel / [[Epic Comics]] [[miniseries]] ''[[Atomic Age (comics)|Atomic Age]]'' (Nov. 1990 - Feb. 1991), by writer [[Frank Lovece]] and penciler [[Mike Okamoto]], for which Williamson won a 1991 [[Eisner Award]] for Best Inker. ''Daredevil'' penciler [[John Romita, Jr.]] recalled that, "Working with Al Williamson was much like working with my father [comics artist [[John Romita Sr.]]] in that I felt that I was protected from mistakes. ... If my art wasn<U+2019>t correct, then Al would repair it. Oddly enough, Al said he never had to fix anything, claiming he just 'traced' over my pencils."<ref>{{cite news | last = Cordier | first = Philippe | date =April 2007 | title = Seeing Red: Dissecting Daredevil's Defining Years | work =[[Back Issue (magazine)|Back Issue]] | issue = 21  | pages= 33<U+2013>60 '''which page is quote on?''' | publisher = [[TwoMorrows Publishing]] | accessdate = January 20, 2013}}</ref>

In 1995, Marvel released a two-part ''[[Flash Gordon]]'' miniseries written by [[Mark Schultz (comics)|Mark Schultz]] and drawn by Williamson, which was his last major work doing both pencils and inks. Also with Schultz, he illustrated the short story "One Last Job" for ''[[Dark Horse Presents]]'' #120 in 1997. In 1999, he drew the ''Flash Gordon'' character a final time when regular cartoonist [[Jim Keefe]] asked for his help on a ''Flash Gordon'' Sunday page.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jimkeefe.com/studio/williamson/williamson.htm|title=Jim Keefe's account of Williamson's Flash Gordon page|accessdate=2009-06-16 |publisher=Jim Keefe}}</ref>

===Later life and career===
Since 1998, there have been six career retrospective books published (see "Further Reading" section).  Williamson cooperated with their production, with the exception of the books from Pure Imagination. He was interviewed for the 2003 [[Frank Frazetta]] documentary ''Painting with Fire'', along with fellow surviving "Fleagle Gang" members [[Angelo Torres]] and [[Nick Meglin]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cinemachine.net/fraz_timeline.html|title=Production Timeline|publisher=Cinemachine (self-published)|accessdate=2009-11-10}} [http://www.webcitation.org/5lBOV6zXh Archived] 2009-11-10.</ref> In 2009, a Williamson illustrated [[Sub-Mariner]] story written by Schultz and dedicated to Sub-Mariner creator [[Bill Everett]] was published.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=user_review&id=915|last = Zawisza | first = Doug | title=Sub-Mariner 70th Anniversary Special | date = April 14, 2009 |accessdate=2009-04-18 |work=Comic Book Resources| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20090417043817/http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=user_review&id=915| archivedate= 17 April 2009 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> The story itself was originally drawn ten years previously.<ref>Spurlock, J.
