The '''SS ''Empire Miniver''''' was a British steam merchant ship. She was originally an American merchant, launched in 1918 as '''SS ''West Cobalt'''''. During a brief stint in the [[United States Navy]] in 1919, she was known as '''USS ''West Cobalt'' (ID-3836)'''.

SS ''West Cobalt'' was built as a [[steam engine|steam]]-powered [[cargo ship]] in 1918 for the {{USSB|first=long}}. She was part of the ''West'' boats, a series of steel-[[hull (watercraft)|hull]]ed cargo ships built on the [[West Coast of the United States]] for the [[First World War]] war effort, and was the 11th ship built at [[Columbia River Shipbuilding Company]] in [[Portland, Oregon]]. Though she was completed too late for the war, she was [[ship commissioning|commissioned]] into the {{NOTS|first=long}} of the [[United States Navy]] as USS ''West Cobalt'' (ID-3836) in January 1919. After her one overseas trip for the Navy<U+2014>delivering grain products to [[Danzig]]<U+2014>she was decommissioned in May 1919 and returned to the {{USSB}}.

''West Cobalt'' had a relatively uneventful merchant career for the {{USSB}} and, after her 1933 sale, for the [[Lykes Brothers Steamship Company]]. In June 1940, ''West Cobalt'' was sold to British interests and renamed ''Empire Miniver''. Just over four months later, the ship was torpedoed and sunk by German submarine [[German submarine U-99 (1940)|''U-99'']] while carrying supplies to the UK in [[Convoy SC-7]] during the [[Second World War]]. Three crewmen were killed in the attack; the [[captain (nautical)|master]] and 34 others were rescued by a British [[corvette]].

== Design and construction ==
The ''West'' ships were [[cargo ship]]s of similar size and design built by several shipyards on the [[West Coast of the United States]] for the {{USSB|first=long}} for emergency use during the [[First World War]]. All were given names that began with the word ''West'', like ''West Cobalt'',<ref name=CW-358>Crowell and Wilson, pp. 358<U+2013>59.</ref> the ninth of some 30 ''West'' ships built by the [[Columbia River Shipbuilding Company]] of [[Portland, Oregon]].<ref name=Colton /> ''West Cobalt'' (Columbia River Shipbuilding yard number 11)<ref name=Colton /> was [[ship naming and launching|launched]] on 26 October 1918,<ref name=Miramar /> and was completed in December.<ref name=Colton />

''West Cobalt'' was {{GRT|5,724|first=yes}}, and was {{convert|410|ft|1|in|m}} long ([[length between perpendiculars|between perpendiculars]])<ref name=Miramar /> and {{convert|54|ft|0|in|m}} [[beam (nautical)|abeam]]. She had a steel [[hull (watercraft)|hull]] that [[displacement (ship)|displaced]] 12,424 t with a [[mean]] [[draft (hull)|draught]] of {{convert|24|ft|2|in|m}}.<ref name=DANFS /> Her [[hold (ship)|hold]] was {{convert|29|ft|9|in|m}} deep and she had a [[deadweight tonnage]] of {{DWT|8,028}}.<ref name=DANFS /> ''West Cobalt''{{'}}s power plant consisted of a single [[steam turbine]] driving a single [[screw propeller]] which moved the ship at up to {{convert|11|knots|km/h}}.<ref name=Miramar />

== US Navy career ==
Upon completion of ''West Cobalt'' in December 1918,<ref name=Colton /> a month after the end of fighting in the First World War, she was handed over to the [[United States Navy]] for use in the {{NOTS|first=long}}. She was [[ship commissioning|commissioned]] as USS ''West Cobalt'' (ID-3836) on 29 December at the [[Puget Sound Navy Yard]] in [[Bremerton, Washington]], with [[Lieutenant Commander (United States)|Lieutenant Commander]] Andrew Patterson, [[United States Naval Reserve Forces|USNRF]], in command.<ref name=DANFS />

After undergoing [[sea trial]]s, ''West Cobalt'' sailed for [[San Pedro, California]], on 11 January to load a cargo of grain on behalf of the [[American Relief Administration]].<ref name=DANFS /><ref group=Note>The ''West'' ships, to avoid sailing empty to the [[East Coast of the United States|East Coast]], loaded grain products intended for European ports and sailed from the East Coast without unloading or transferring their cargo. To avoid extra handling of the cargo, the [[United States Shipping Board]], by prior arrangement, received an equivalent amount of cargo space in foreign ships for other American cargos. See: Crowell and Wilson, pp. 358<U+2013>59.</ref> Six days later, ''West Cobalt'' headed for [[Norfolk, Virginia]], where she arrived on 10 February. After fuel replenishment, ''West Cobalt'' sailed on 19 February for [[Plymouth]],<ref name=DANFS /> where she arrived on 11 March,<ref>{{cite news | title = Ocean steamship movements | work = [[Chicago Daily Tribune]] | date = 12 March 1919 | page = 2 }}</ref> the [[Hook of Holland]], and [[Danzig]]. After delivering her cargo, used to help feed the hungry in the aftermath of the war, she steamed for New York on 8 April. After reaching New York on 24 April, ''West Cobalt'' was decommissioned on 5 May and returned to the {{USSB}}.<ref name=DANFS />

== Civilian career ==
Many details of ''West Cobalt''{{'}}s post-Navy career remain undiscovered, but mentions in shipping reports in contemporary newspapers offer hints at her activities. In 1924, for example, reports in ''[[The New York Times]]'' mention a departure from New York for [[Manchester]] on 27 August,<ref>{{cite news | title = Shipping and mails | work = [[The New York Times]] | date = 22 August 1924 | page = 17 }}</ref> and an arrival at [[Liverpool]] on 8 September.<ref>{{cite news | title = Shipping and mails | work = The New York Times | date = 10 September 1924 | page = 23 }}</ref> By 1930, ''West Cobalt'' was reported in ''[[The Washington Post]]'' as sailing on a [[New Orleans, Louisiana|New Orleans]] <U+2013> London route.<ref name=WP-officers>{{cite news | author = [[Associated Press]] | title = Officers of Shipping Board craft arrested | work = [[The Washington Post]] | date = 16 October 1930 | page = 5 }}</ref> On 15 October of that year, the [[captain (nautical)|captain]] and four other officers of ''West Cobalt'' were arrested at New Orleans after {{convert|12|USqt|L}} of [[liquor]]<U+2014>against the law under [[Prohibition in the United States|Prohibition]]<U+2014>were found on board the ship. The five men were held under $1,000 bond each.<ref name=WP-officers /><ref group=Note>No further information on the outcome of legal proceedings against the men was reported in the newspaper.</ref>

In 1933, ''West Cobalt'' was sold to the [[Lykes Brothers Steamship Company]], which assigned her to its Ripley Steamship Company subsidiary.<ref name=Mariners>{{cite web | title = The 'Empire' ships: M | url = http://www.mariners-l.co.uk/EmpireM.html | work = Mariners | publisher = Ted Finch | date = 14 June 2001 | accessdate = 20 September 2008 }}</ref> During the 1930s, Lykes Brothers operated cargo ships between [[Gulf Coast of the United States|Gulf Coast]] and [[Caribbean]] ports,<ref>{{cite web | last = Kleiner | first = Diana J | title = Lykes Brothers | url = http://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/LL/etlzz.html | work = [[Handbook of Texas|Handbook of Texas Online]] | accessdate = 20 September 2008 }}</ref> and though there is little specific information available regarding ''West Cobalt''{{'}}s movements, it is likely that she called at Gulf coast and Caribbean ports as well. One specific mention of the ship is found in a report in ''The New York Times'' in 1937, when the newspaper reported ''West Cobalt''{{'}}s arrival in New York on 30 October, ten days after sailing from New Orleans.<ref>{{cite news | title = Shipping and mails | work = The New York Times | date = 31 October 1937 | page = 63 }}</ref>

== Second World War ==
In June 1940, the {{USMC|first=long}} granted permission to Lykes to sell ''West Cobalt'' and three other ships to the Bank Line of [[Glasgow]] for transfer to British registry.<ref>{{cite news | title = Lets six freighters be sold to British | work = The New York Times | date = 13 June 1940 | page = 15 }}</ref><ref group=Note>The other three ships were ''Western Queen'', ''West Harshaw'', and ''West Quechee''.</ref> ''West Cobalt'', loaded with scrap iron,<ref>{{cite AHCD | convoynumber = 55 | convoytype = HX | accessdate = 22 September 2008 }}</ref> sailed from [[Hampton Roads, Virginia]], on 28 June for [[City of Halifax|Halifax]]. After arriving there on 2 July, ''West Cobalt'' sailed the next day in [[Convoy HX-55]] for [[Liverpool]].<ref name=CPDB-Cobalt>{{cite web | title = Port Arrivals/Departures: West Cobalt | url = http://convoyweb.org.uk/ports/index.html?search.php?vessel=WEST+COBALT~armain | work = Arnold Hague's Ports Database | publisher = Convoy Web | date = | accessdate = 22 September 2008 }}</ref> On the night of 15/16 July, ''West Cobalt'' dropped astern of the convoy and was last sighted at 01:00 by British merchant ship ''Loch Don''.<ref>{{cite web | last = Lawson | first = Siri | title = Convoy HX 55: Cruising Order & Advance Sailing Telegram | url = http://warsailors.com/convoys/hx55.html | work = Ships in Atlantic Convoys | publisher = WarSailors.com | date = | accessdate = 22 September 2008 }}</ref> ''West Cobalt'' continued on, however, and reached Liverpool independently on 18 July.<ref name=CPDB-Cobalt />

Soon transferred to the [[Ministry of War Transport]], the newly renamed ship, now named ''Empire Miniver'', was assigned to Andrew Weir & Co. of London for operation.<ref name=Mariners /> She sailed from Liverpool in her first wartime convoy under her new name, [[Convoy OB-205]], on 29 August 1940. The convoy dispersed the next day after coming under attack from at least four German submarines: [[German submarine U-59 (1939)|''U-59'']], [[German submarine U-38 (1938)|''U-38'']], [[German submarine U-60 (1939)|''U-60'']], and [[German submarine U-101 (1940)|''U-101'']].<!-- dispersal --><ref name=CPDB>{{cite web | title = Port Arrivals/Departures: Empire Miniver | url = http://convoyweb.org.uk/ports/index.html?search.php?vessel=EMPIRE+MINIVER~armain | work = Arnold Hague's Ports Database | publisher = Convoy Web | date = | accessdate = 20 September 2008 }}</ref><ref name=OB-205>{{cite web | last = Helgason | first = Gu<U+00F0>mundur | title = Convoy battles: Ships hit from convoy OB-205 | url = http://uboat.net/ops/convoys/convoys.php?convoy=OB-205 | work = The U-Boat War 1939<U+2013>1945 | publisher = uboat.net | accessdate = 20 September 2008 }}</ref><!-- Uboats, damage to convoy ships --> Though three ships from the convoy were sunk, two were damaged, and a sixth was a total loss,<ref name=OB-205 /> ''Empire Miniver'' arrived at Hampton Roads, on 15 September and at [[Baltimore, Maryland|Baltimore]] two days later.<ref name=CPDB />

After a nine-day turnaround, ''Empire Miniver'' sailed independently to [[Sydney, Nova Scotia]],<ref name=CPDB /> with a cargo of cargo of 4,500 tons of [[pig iron]] and 6,200 tons of [[steel]],<ref name=uboat>{{cite web | last = Helgason | first = Gu<U+00F0>mundur | title = Allied Ships hit by U-boats: Empire Miniver | url = http://uboat.net/allies/merchants/614.html | work = The U-Boat War 1939<U+2013>1945 | publisher = uboat.net | accessdate = 20 September 2008 }}</ref> arriving on 2 October.<ref name=CPDB /> At Sydney, she joined the ill-fated [[Convoy SC-7]], bound for [[Newport]], for her return journey. The convoy had only a single escort to start with, the [[sloop-of-war|sloop]] {{HMS|Scarborough|U25|2}}. The convoy was located by a [[Wolfpack (naval tactic)|wolfpack]] of [[U-boat]]s from 16 October, and they quickly overwhelmed the convoy, sinking many of the ships. ''Empire Miniver'' was torpedoed and sunk by [[German submarine U-99 (1940)|''U-99'']] at 22:06 hours on 18 October, while some {{convert|100|nmi|km}} [[west by south]] of [[Barra Head]]. Out of a total complement of 38, three crew members were lost. The master and 34 crew members were picked up by {{HMS|Bluebell|K80|2}} and were landed at [[Greenock]] on 20 October.<ref name=uboat /> Including ''Empire Miniver'', 20 ships<U+2014>over half of the ships in Convoy SC-7<U+2014>were sunk by 8 different U-boats.<!-- number of ships, U-boats with kills--><ref>{{cite web | last = Helgason | first = Gu<U+00F0>mundur | title = Convoy battles: Ships hit from convoy SC-7 | url = http://uboat.net/ops/convoys/convoys.php?convoy=SC-7 | work = The U-Boat War 1939<U+2013>1945 | publisher = uboat.net | accessdate = 20 September 2008 }}</ref><ref>{{cite AHCD | convoynumber = 7 | convoytype = SC | accessdate = 20 September 2008 }}<!-- number of ships in convoy --> The number of merchant ships reported in the convoy by the source was between 34 and 37.</ref>
