The '''Transnational Association of Christian Colleges and Schools''' ('''TRACS''') is a [[List of recognized higher education accreditation organizations|national educational accreditation]] agency for [[Christian Colleges|Christian colleges]], universities, and seminaries in the United States.<ref name="TRACSOfficial">{{cite news | url=http://tracs.org/about.htm | title=TRACS: Transnational Association of Christian Colleges and Schools About | publisher=Transnational Association of Christian Colleges and Schools | year=2008 | first= | last= | accessdate = 2009-07-10}}</ref> TRACS, which is based in [[Forest, Virginia]], is recognized by the [[United States Department of Education]] and the [[Council for Higher Education Accreditation]].<ref>{{cite news | title=All Accreditors | author= | url=http://www.chea.org/pdf/CHEA_USDE_AllAccred.pdf | format= | publisher=[[Council for Higher Education Accreditation]] | year=2008 | accessdate=2011-01-19}}</ref>

==History==
The organization was founded in 1971 to "promote the welfare, interests, and development of postsecondary institutions, whose mission is characterized by a distinctly Christian purpose."<ref name="TRACSOfficial" /> According to the [[Institute for Creation Research]] (ICR), TRACS is a "product of the ICR" and was created "Because of the prejudice against [[creation science|creation-science]], outspoken creationist schools" that had "little or no chance of getting recognition through accreditation."<ref name="ICROrigins">{{cite news | title= The ICR Graduates | author=Sandra Blakeslee| url=http://www.icr.org/article/495/| format= | publisher=[[Institute for Creation Research]] | year=2007 | accessdate=2007-11-26 }}</ref> Currently TRACS requires all accredited schools to have a statement of faith that affirms "the inerrancy and historicity of the Bible" and "the divine work of [[Creationism|non-evolutionary creation]] including persons in God's image".<ref>{{cite news | title=Accreditation Standards | author= | url=http://www.tracs.org/files/accreditation_standards.pdf | format= | publisher=Transnational Association of Christian Colleges and Schools  | year=2009 | accessdate=2008-12-26 }} page 80 also see: "Biblical Creation. Special creation of the existing space-time universe and all its basic systems and kinds of organisms in the six literal days of the creation week." on page 81</ref>

TRACS's first application for federal recognition in 1987 was denied, but in 1991, [[United States Secretary of Education|U.S. Education Secretary]] [[Lamar Alexander]] "approved TRACS, despite his advisory panel's repeatedly recommending against recognition."<ref name="RejectingAdvice">{{cite news | title=Alexander Grants Federal Recognition to Christian Accrediting Body | author=Scott Jaschik | url=http://chronicle.com/article/Alexander-Grants-Accrediting/80601/ | format=A40 | publisher=[[The Chronicle of Higher Education]] | date=Sep 4, 1991 | accessdate=2012-07-14}}</ref> Approval came following TRACS' third rejection by the board in which Secretary Alexander "arranged for an appeal hearing," and critics of the approval said the move was about politics.<ref name="RejectingAdvice"/> TRACS' approval "worried" accrediting officials who concluded that TRACS was not a qualified accreditor and the move was criticized by education officials.<ref>{{cite news | title=Accrediting body angers secretary of education | author= | url=http://docs.newsbank.com/g/GooglePM/WT/lib00179,0EB0EF6AF5F54465.html | publisher=[[Washington Times]] | date=Nov 7, 1991 | accessdate=2008-12-26 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news | title=Battle Lines Drawn on a College Diversity Debate | author= | url=http://docs.newsbank.com/g/GooglePM/PI/lib00187,0EB2A28280FA2D5C.html | publisher=[[Philadelphia Inquirer]] | date=Oct 20, 1991 | accessdate=2008-12-26 }}</ref><ref name="HousePanel">{{cite news | title=House Panel Looks Into Recognition of Christian Accrediting Body | author=Scott Jaschik | url=http://chronicle.com/article/House-Panel-Looks-Into/80340/ | format=A40 | publisher=[[The Chronicle of Higher Education]] | date=September 25, 1991 | accessdate=2012-07-14}}</ref>

Another source of criticism was the 1991 granting of accreditation to the [[Institute for Creation Research]]. One of TRACS' board members was [[Henry M. Morris]], founder of ICR. Attorney Timothy Sandefur called Morris's position on the board "highly questionable".<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.pandasthumb.org/archives/2004/03/how_the_icr_got.html | title=How the ICR got its accreditation|publisher=[[Panda's Thumb weblog|Panda's Thumb]] | date=March 29, 2004 | first=Timothy | last=Sandefur | accessdate = 2006-11-04}}</ref>  In 2007 [[John D. Morris]], Henry Morris' son, asked TRACS to terminate the ICR's accreditation.<ref>{{cite web | archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080910084301/http://www.tracs.org/DOE_Nov07.pdf |url=http://www.tracs.org/DOE_Nov07.pdf| title=Accreditation Commission Action | publisher=Transnational Association of Christian Colleges and Schools | year=2007 | first= | last= | accessdate = 2008-12-04 |archivedate=2008-09-10}}</ref> The reason was, in part, that the ICR moved to Texas<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.texscience.org/reviews/icr-thecb-certification.htm  | title=The ICR Quest for Official Texas Certification | publisher=[[Texas Citizens for Science]] | year=2007 | first= | last= | accessdate = 2008-12-04}}</ref> and the state did not recognize TRACS.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.thecb.state.tx.us/reports/docfetch.cfm?DocID=1254&Format=PDF | title=Accreditation Information | publisher=[[Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board]] | year=2007 | first= | last= | accessdate = 2008-12-04}}</ref>

In 1993, [[Steve Levicoff]] published a book-length critical discussion of TRACS, ''When the TRACS Stop Short: An Evaluation and Critique of the Transnational Association of Christian Colleges and Schools.''<ref name="Nameit">{{cite book |first=Steve |last=Levicoff |authorlink=Steve Levicoff |title=[[Name It and Frame It?]] |edition=3rd |publisher=Institute on Religion and Law |year=1993 |page=25 |asin=B0006F1PCQ  |oclc=27784264}}</ref><ref name="Faulted"/><ref>Steve Levicoff, ''[http://www.scribd.com/doc/117386475/When-The-TRACS-Stop-Short When the TRACS stop short : an evaluation and critique of the Transnational Association of Christian Colleges and Schools]'' (Ambler, PA: Institute on Religion and Law, 1993).</ref> Levicoff criticized TRACS's expedited accreditation of [[Liberty University]] and its creation of a category for schools which it called ''associate schools.'' While this category "was not considered an official accreditation," Levicoff argued that TRACS lent its name to a number of "blatantly fraudulent institutions."<ref name="DinosaurTRACS">{{Wayback| url=http://www.nexusjournal.org/2002judicial/dinosaurtracsRTP.htm | title=Dinosaur TRACS: The Approaching Conflict between Establishment Clause Jurisprudence And College Accreditation Procedures|date= 20031205173958}}, Timothy Sandefur, Nexus law journal, [[Chapman University School of Law]], March 24, 2002</ref> Liberty gained TRACS accreditation in September 1984, but resigned its accreditation on November 6, 2008.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://ope.ed.gov/accreditation/InstAccrDetails.aspx?756e697469643d3134373730332663616d70757349643d30267264743d352f32322f3230303920363a32313a343920504d |title=Accreditation Details: Liberty University  |publisher=[[United States Department of Education]] |year=2009 |accessdate=2009-02-28}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.tracs.org/files/DOE_Nov08.pdf | title=Commission Action November 2008  |publisher=Transnational Association of Christian Colleges and Schools | date=November 2008  | first= | last= | accessdate = 2009-02-28}}</ref>

In 1995, a federal review was conducted and [[National Advisory Committee on Institutional Quality and Integrity]] placed TRACS on 18 months probation.<ref name="Faulted">{{cite news | title= Christian Accrediting Group Faulted in Federal Review | author=Scott Jaschik  | url=http://chronicle.com/article/Christian-Accrediting-Group/83591/ | publisher=[[The Chronicle of Higher Education]] | date=1995-06-16 | accessdate=2008-12-26 }}</ref> Critics argued that TRACS should have never had approval and the reason for the initial rejections "wasn't over doctrine, but whether they were in the process of accrediting schools which truly gave degrees in line with other similar degrees."<ref name="Faulted"/> One reason for the probation was TRACS starting the  accrediting process for schools that could not meet basic requirements, such as [[Nashville Bible College]], which was granted "accreditation candidate status" when it had 12 full-time students, 7 part-time students, and 2 part-time faculty members.<ref name="Faulted"/> Improvements were made, including eliminating the "associate schools" category and changing chairmen.<ref name="DinosaurTRACS" />

It currently has authority for the "accreditation and preaccreditation ("Candidate" status) of postsecondary institutions in the United States that offer certificates, diplomas, and associate, baccalaureate, and graduate degrees, including institutions that offer distance education." Its most recent scheduled review for recognition was in 2011.<ref>{{cite news | title=National Advisory Committee on Institutional Quality and Integrity June 8-10, 2011 Meeting | author= | url=http://www2.ed.gov/about/bdscomm/list/naciqi-dir/2011-spring/naciqi-6-2011-agenda.pdf | publisher=[[US Department of Education]] | year=2011 | accessdate=2012-12-18}}</ref> TRACS was granted reauthorization after their latest appearance before NACIQI in June 2013.
