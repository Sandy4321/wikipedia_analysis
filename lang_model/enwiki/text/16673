'''Diphenylamine''' is the [[organic compound]] with the [[chemical formula|formula]] (C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>5</sub>)<sub>2</sub>NH.  It is a colourless solid, but samples are often yellow due to oxidized impurities.<ref name=Ullmann>P. F. Vogt, J. J. Gerulis, <U+201C>Amines, Aromatic<U+201D> in Ullmann<U+2019>s Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry 2005, Wiley-VCH, Weinheim.</ref>

==Preparation and reactivity==
Diphenylamine is manufactured by the thermal deamination of [[aniline]] over oxide [[catalyst]]s:
: 2 C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>5</sub>NH<sub>2</sub>  <U+2192>   (C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>5</sub>)<sub>2</sub>NH  +  NH<sub>3</sub>
It is a weak base, with a ''K''<sub>B</sub> of 10<sup>-14</sup>.  With strong acids, it forms the water soluble salt.

==Applications==
Diphenylamine is used as a pre- or postharvest scald inhibitor for apples. Its anti-scald activity is the result of its antioxidant properties, which protect the apple skin from the oxidation products of alpha-farnesene during storage.<ref>"Apple Scald, a Complex Problem"

Diphenylamine derivatives are also useful.  Ring-alkylated derivatives of diphenylamine are used as "antiozinates" in the manufacture of rubber products, reflecting the antioxidant nature of aniline derivatives.  The compound undergoes various cyclisaton reactions.  With [[sulfur]], it gives [[phenothiazine]], a precursor to certain pharmaceuticals.<ref>T. Kahl, K.-W. Schr<U+00F6>der, F. R. Lawrence, W. J. Marshall, Hartmut H<U+00F6>ke, Rudolf J<U+00E4>ckh, "Aniline" in Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry, 2005, Wiley-VCH: Weinheim.</ref>
: (C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>5</sub>)<sub>2</sub>NH  +  2 S  <U+2192>   S(C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>NH  +  H<sub>2</sub>S
With iodine, it cyclises to [[carbazole]]:
: (C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>5</sub>)<sub>2</sub>NH  +  I<sub>2</sub>  <U+2192>   (C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>NH  +  2 [[hydrogen iodide|HI]]
Arylation with [[iodobenzene]] gives [[triphenylamine]].<ref>{{OrgSynth | author = F. D. Hager| title = Triphenylamine| collvol = 1 | collvolpages = 544 | year = 1941 | prep = CV1P0544}}</ref>

==Safety==
Diphenylamine, like other arylamines, is toxic.  Exposure is highly regulated in most countries.  See MSDS.
