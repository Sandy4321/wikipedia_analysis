'''SPIN''' (Searchable Physics Information Notices) '''bibliographic database''' is an indexing and abstracting service produced by the [[American Institute of Physics]] (AIP). The content focus of SPIN is described as the most signifigant areas of[[ physics]] [[research]]. This type of [[scientific literature|literature coverage]] spans the major [[scientific journal|phyisical science journals]] and magazines. Major [[conference proceedings]] that are reported by the American Institute of Physics, member societies, as well as affiliated organizations are also included as part of this database. This totals to 1.5 million articles as of 2010. ''SPIN''  has no print counterpart.<ref name=DialogSpin/><ref name=AIP-SPIN/>    

==Journals==
Delivery of timely indexing and abstracting is for, what are deemed to be, the signifigant or important [[physics]] and [[astronomy]] journals from the United States, Russia, and the Ukraine. Citations for journal articles are derived from original publications of the ''AIP'', which includes published translated works. At the same time, citations are included from member societies, and selectively chosen American journals. Citations become typically available online on the same date as the corresponding journal article.<ref name=DialogSpin/><ref name=AIP-SPIN> {{Cite web

==Sources==
Overall, the source citations are derived from material published by the AIP and member societies,  which are English-speaking, Russian, and Ukrainaian journals and conference proceedings. Certain American physics-related articles are also sources of citations. About 60 journals have cover to cover indexing, and about 100 journals, overall, are indexed.<ref name=DialogSpin/><ref name=pub-coverage>{{Cite web
