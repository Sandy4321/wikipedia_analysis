{{DISPLAYTITLE:''Sesame Street'' characters}}
A wide variety of characters have appeared on the American [[children's television series]] ''[[Sesame Street]]''. A large number of the characters are [[The Muppets|Muppets]], which are puppets made in [[Jim Henson]]'s distinctive puppet-creation style. Most of the non-Muppet characters are human characters, but there are a few characters that are [[Animation|animated]].

==General information==
[[Image:Jim Henson (1989).jpg|right|thumb|upright|[[Jim Henson]], creator of [[The Muppets]], in 1989.]]
[[Jim Henson]] created many [[The Muppets|Muppet]] characters for the purpose of appearing on ''Sesame Street''. His involvement with the show began when he and one of the creators, [[Joan Ganz Cooney]], met in the summer of 1968 at one of the show's five three-day curriculum planning seminars in Boston. Author Christopher Finch reported that director [[Jon Stone]], who had worked with Henson previously, felt that if they could not bring him on board, they should "make do without puppets".<ref name="Finch, p. 53">Finch, p. 53</ref>
 
Henson was initially reluctant, but he agreed to join ''Sesame Street'' for social goals. He also agreed to waive his performance fee for full ownership of the ''Sesame Street'' Muppets and to split any revenue they generated with the [[Sesame Workshop|Children's Television Workshop]], the series' non-profit producer.<ref name="davis-5">Davis, p. 5</ref> The Muppets were a crucial part of the show's popularity and it brought Henson national attention.<ref name="morrow-93">Morrow, p. 93</ref> In early research, the Muppet segments of the show scored high, and more Muppets were added during the first few seasons. The Muppets were effective teaching tools because children easily recognized them, they were stereotypical and predictable, and they appealed to adults and older siblings.<ref name="morrow-9495">Morrow, pp. 94<U+2013>95</ref>

During the production of ''Sesame Street's'' first season, producers created five one-hour episodes to test the show's appeal to children and examine their comprehension of the material. Not intended for broadcast, they were presented to preschoolers in 60 homes throughout Philadelphia and in day care centers in New York City in July 1969.<ref name="Lesser-164">Lesser, p. 164</ref> The results were "generally very positive";<ref name="Fisch-39">Finch, p. 39</ref> children learned from the shows, their appeal was high, and children's attention was sustained over the full hour.<ref name="Lesser-164">Lesser, p. 164</ref> However, the researchers found that although children's attention was high during the Muppet segments, their interest wavered during the "Street" segments, when no Muppets were on screen. This was because the producers had followed the advice of child psychologists who were concerned that children would be confused if human actors and Muppets were shown together. As a result of this decision, the appeal of the test episodes was lower than the target.<ref name="Fisch-39">Finch, p. 39</ref><ref name="Gladwell-105">Gladwell, p. 105</ref>

The Street scenes were "the glue" that "pulled the show together",<ref name="Gladwell-106">Gladwell, p. 106</ref> so producers knew they needed to make significant changes. The producers decided to reject the advisers' advice and reshot the Street segments; Henson and his coworkers created Muppets that could interact with the human actors,<ref name="Gladwell-106">Gladwell, p. 106</ref><ref name="fisch3940">Fisch & Bernstein, pp. 39<U+2013>40</ref> These test episodes were directly responsible for what writer [[Malcolm Gladwell]] called "the essence of ''Sesame Street''<U+2014>the artful blend of fluffy monsters and earnest adults".<ref name="Gladwell-106">Gladwell, p. 106</ref> Since 2001, the full rights for the ''Sesame Street'' Muppets have been owned by Sesame Workshop, as the CTW was renamed in 2000.<ref name="retsinas">{{cite news | last = Retsinas | first = Greg | title = Hensons Buying Back the Muppets for $89 Million | work = The New York Times | date = 2003-05-08| url = http://www.nytimes.com/2003/05/08/business/media/08MUPP.html | accessdate = 2011-12-07}}</ref>

Fisch and Dr. Lewis Bernstein to be a [[canary]],<ref name="fisch3940"/> who resides in a large nest alongside the "123 Sesame Street" building<ref name="bigbird"/> and represents the 6-year-old child with his tendency to question everything.<ref>Borgenicht, p. 33</ref><ref>Gikow, p. 51</ref> Also living outside of the building is [[Oscar the Grouch]], a trash can-dwelling creature belonging to [[Grouches|his own unique species]], who is portrayed as a habitual pessimist<ref name="oscar">{{cite web | title = Oscar | publisher = Sesame Street.org | url =http://www.sesamestreet.org/onair/characters/oscar | accessdate = 2011-04-11}}</ref> and was designed to give kids "permission to feel grouchy<U+2014>and to demonstrate differing opinions".<ref>Gikow, p. 157</ref> Oscar and Big Bird were specifically created for the reshooting of the "Street" scenes with the idea that they would be able to interact with the human characters.<ref name="Fisch & Bernstein, p. 40">Fisch & Bernstein, p. 40</ref> Big Bird's best friend is [[Aloysius Snuffleupagus]] (better known as "Snuffy"), who was portrayed as the bird's [[imaginary friend]] until revealed to the human cast in 1985.<ref>Borgenicht, p. 38</ref><ref name="snuffy">{{cite web | title = Aloysius Snuffleupagus | publisher = Sesame Street.org |url = http://www.sesamestreet.org/onair/characters/snuffy | accessdate = 2011-03-24}}</ref> For his part, Oscar has several friends of his own despite his pessimism; these include the grouch's pet worm, [[Slimey the Worm|Slimey]],<ref name="oscar"/> and his girlfriend [[Grundgetta]].<ref>Davis, p. 322</ref> Two other Muppets who have appeared on the show since its beginning are [[Ernie and Bert]], a pair of best friends with contrasting personalities; Ernie is portrayed as a free-spirited trickster who loves his [[rubber duck]],<ref>Borgenicht, pp. 21-25</ref><ref>{{cite web | title = Ernie | publisher = Sesame Street.org | url =http://www.sesamestreet.org/onair/characters/ernie | accessdate = 2011-03-30}}</ref> while Bert is the world-weary foil to his friend's na<U+00EF>ve trouble-making, and shows himself to be obsessed with things like [[Columbidae|pigeons]] and paper clips.<ref>Finch, p. 61</ref>

[[The Bear family|The Three Bears]] from the story of [[Goldilocks and the Three Bears|Goldilocks]] appear in Muppet form on ''Sesame Street''.<ref name="Unpaved-132">Borgenicht, p. 132</ref> Also appearing on the show are an unidentified species of furry characters referred to as "monsters".<ref name="Gladwell-106"/> Among these are [[Cookie Monster]], a blue monster who is addicted to the [[Cookie|baked goods for which he is named]]<ref>Borgenicht, p. 65</ref> but ironically also likes healthy foods;<ref>{{cite web | title = Cookie Monster | publisher = Sesame Street.org| url =http://www.sesamestreet.org/onair/characters/cookie_monster | accessdate = 2011-03-24}}</ref> [[Telly Monster]], a purple worrywart who overthinks everything, was described by writer David Borgenicht as "neurotic", and was originally portrayed as a [[Television addiction|television addict]];<ref>Borgenicht, p. 78</ref> [[Zoe (Sesame Street)|Zoe]], a yellow-orange female monster who is "simultaneously dainty and strong, practical and impulsive"<ref>Borgenicht, p. 87</ref> and loves to dance ballet;<ref>{{cite web | title = Zoe | publisher = Sesame Street.org | url =http://www.sesamestreet.org/onair/characters/zoe | accessdate = 2011-04-12}}</ref> and [[Rosita (Sesame Street character)|Rosita]], a bilingual turquoise monster (also female) who speaks both English and Spanish.<ref>Borgenicht, p. 132</ref> [[Grover]], a blue monster described by Borgenicht as "self-confident, furry, cute, capable, and intelligent",<ref>Borgenicht, p. 46</ref> has a superhero alter-ego named "Super Grover", who is more well-meaning than helpful.<ref>{{cite web | title = Grover | publisher = Sesame Street.org | url =http://www.sesamestreet.org/onair/characters/grover | accessdate = 2011-03-30}}</ref> In addition to Ernie and Bert, recognizable humanoid Muppets appearing on the show also include [[Count von Count]], a number-obsessed [[vampire]] based on [[Bela Lugosi]]'s interpretation of [[Count Dracula]];<ref>Davis, p. 239</ref> and [[Prairie Dawn]], a methodic and driven young girl who loves to write and direct [[Procession|pageants]] featuring her friends.<ref>{{cite web | title = Prairie Dawn | publisher = Sesame Street.org| url =http://www.sesamestreet.org/onair/characters/prairie_dawn | accessdate = 2011-04-11}}</ref>

One Muppet monster who became a household name in the show's recent history is [[Elmo]], a red monster representing the three- to four-year-old child; Elmo became what his eventual portrayer, [[Kevin Clash]], considered a "phenomenon"<ref>Borgenicht, p. 9</ref> after Clash took over the role in 1983, and his popularity ultimately grew to the point where he became what writer Michael Davis called "the embodiment of ''Sesame Street''".<ref>Davis, p. 249</ref> In 1998, the Muppet got his own segment occupying the last 15 minutes of the show, "[[Elmo's World]]", in which he explored child-centered topics<ref>Fisch & Bernstein, p. 45</ref> from two worlds of [[live action]] and [[computer animation]], which looked like "a child's squiggly crayon drawing come to life".<ref>Clash, p. 75</ref> "Elmo's World" continued until 2012, when another segment starring the character, "Elmo the Musical", was introduced to replace it.<ref>Jensen, Elizabeth (2012-09-13).

Retrieved 2013-08-07</ref>

At the show's twenty-fifth anniversary in 1993, the producers expanded and redesigned the show's set with a new series of locations dubbed "Around the Corner",<ref>Davis, p. 320</ref> which was dropped from the show in 1997.<ref>Davis, p. 330</ref> One of the "Around the Corner" locations, the Furry Arms Hotel, had a few original Muppets of its own: proprietor Sherry Netherland,<ref>Borgenicht, p. 133</ref> managers Humphrey and Ingrid<ref name="gikow207">Gikow, p. 207</ref> (who had a baby named [[Natasha (Sesame Street)|Natasha]]),<ref name="Unpaved-132"/> and bellhop Benny Rabbit.<ref name="gikow207"/> Even after the rights to the Muppets were sold to [[The Walt Disney Company]], Sesame Workshop has been allowed to have new Muppets designed and built for the show.<ref>{{cite news|title= Kermit Is Now Part of Magic Kingdom|work= The Los Angeles Times|date=2004-02-18|url= http://articles.latimes.com/2004/feb/18/business/fi-muppets18|accessdate=2010-10-18|first=Meg|last=James}}</ref> [[Abby Cadabby]], a pink [[fairy]]-in-training, was introduced to ''Sesame Street'' in 2006; she was created to increase the number of the show's female Muppets.<ref>{{Cite news|url = http://www.nytimes.com/2006/08/06/arts/television/06domi.html?_r=2&pagewanted=all&|title = A Girly-Girl Joins the 'Sesame' Boys|last = Dominus|first = Susan|date = August 6, 2006|work = The New York Times|accessdate = November 20, 2014}}</ref> Another ''Sesame Street'' Muppet created after Disney's purchase of the Muppets is [[Murray Monster]], an orange monster with an energetic, outgoing personality and a sense of quick wit,<ref>{{cite web | title = Murray Monster | publisher = Sesame Street.org| url =http://www.sesamestreet.org/onair/characters/murray_monster | accessdate = 2011-04-11}}</ref> who hosts a segment at the beginning of each episode called "Word on the Street".<ref>Gikow, p. 150</ref>

Other Muppets that have appeared on ''Sesame Street'' over the years have included the [[Two-Headed Monster]], who teaches cooperation while speaking in baby-like gibberish;<ref>Borgenicht, p. 133</ref> the [[Yip Yips]], a species of [[Martian]]s who "valiantly explore our world despite their frequent terrifying encounters with everyday objects";<ref>{{cite web | title = The Yip-Yips (Martians) | publisher = Sesame Street.org |url = http://www.sesamestreet.org/onair/characters/martians | accessdate = 2011-04-11}}</ref> game show host [[Guy Smiley]];<ref>Borgenicht, p. 98</ref> construction workers Biff and Sully;<ref>Davis, p. 242</ref> [[Herry Monster]], a burly blue monster who does not know his own strength;<ref>Borgenicht, p. 103</ref> Forgetful Jones, a "simpleton cowboy"<ref>Davis, p. 242</ref> with a short-term memory disorder;<ref>{{cite web | title = Forgetful Jones | publisher = Sesame Street.org | url =http://www.sesamestreet.org/onair/characters/forgetful_jones |accessdate = 2011-03-30}}</ref> and even [[Kermit the Frog]], the flagship character of The Muppets.<ref>Borgenicht, p. 89</ref>

===Human characters===
{{Further|List of human Sesame Street characters}}
The original human cast, chosen by Stone,<ref name="lesser-99">Lesser, p. 99</ref> consisted of four human characters: [[The Robinson family (Sesame Street)|Gordon Robinson]], a "well-liked and respected" science teacher played by [[Matt Robinson (actor)|Matt Robinson]];<ref>Davis, p. 182</ref> his wife Susan, played by [[Loretta Long]];<ref name="lesser-99"/> [[Mr. Hooper|Mr. Harold Hooper]], a "gruff grocer with [a] warm heart"<ref>Davis, p. 178</ref> portrayed by [[Will Lee]] until his death in 1982;<ref name="davis-284">Davis, p. 284</ref> and [[Bob Johnson (Sesame Street)|Bob Johnson]], a music teacher played by [[Bob McGrath]].<ref>Borgenicht, p. 120</ref> Unlike what was done for most children's television series at the time, the producers of ''Sesame Street'' decided against using a single host and cast a group of ethnically diverse actors,<ref name="lesser-99">Lesser, p. 99</ref> with, as ''Sesame Street'' researcher [[Gerald S. Lesser]] put it, "a variety of distinctive and reliable personalities".<ref name="lesser-125">Lesser, p. 125</ref>

Stone did not audition actors until the spring of 1969, a few weeks before the show's five test shows were due to be filmed. Stone videotaped the auditions, and researcher Ed Palmer took them out into the field to test children's reactions. The actors who received the "most enthusiastic thumbs up" were cast.<ref name="Borgenicht, p. 15">Borgenicht, p. 15</ref> For example, when the children saw Long's audition, they stood up and sang along with her rendition of "[[I'm a Little Teapot]]".<ref name="Borgenicht, p. 15">Borgenicht, p. 15</ref><ref name="davis-172">Davis, p. 172</ref> As Stone said, casting was the only aspect of the show that was "just completely haphazard".<ref name="davis-167">Davis, p. 167</ref> Most of ''Sesame Street''{{'}}s cast and crew found their jobs through personal relationships with Stone and the other producers.<ref name="davis-167">Davis, p. 167</ref>

Bob's former girlfriend was [[Linda (Sesame Street)|Linda]] ([[Linda Bove]]), a librarian who communicated using [[American Sign Language]], and who became the longest-running deaf character in television history.<ref name="additional cast">{{Cite web|title=Additional Cast|url=http://www.sesamestreet.org/parents/theshow/cast/additional_cast|publisher=Sesamestreet.org|accessdate=October 22, 2014}}</ref><ref>Borgenicht, p. 121</ref> In 1985, Gordon and Susan adopted a shy child, Miles, who was later age-progressed into a fun-loving teenager who formed his own band.<ref name="additional cast"/> In 1971, the show introduced a [[Mexican-Americans|Mexican-American]] character named [[The Rodriguez family (Sesame Street)|Luis Rodriguez]] ([[Emilio Delgado]]), a [[repairman]] who has been called the "Mr. Fix-It" of ''Sesame Street''.<ref>Borgenicht, p. 119</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.sesamestreet.org/parents/theshow/cast/emilio-delgado|title = Emilio Delgado: Emilio's Biography|accessdate = 29 October 2014|website = Sesame Street.org}}</ref> Luis married Maria ([[Sonia Manzano]]) in 1988,<ref>Borgenicht, p. 80</ref> and their daughter, Gabi, was born the following year.<ref>{{Cite book|title = "G" is for Growing: Thirty Years of Research on Children and Sesame Street|last = Truglio|first = Rosemarie T.|publisher = Lawrence Erlbaum Publishers|year = 2001|isbn = 0-8058-3395-1|location = Mahweh, New Jersey|pages = 74|last2 = Lovelace|first2 = Valeria O.|last3 = Seqhi|first3 = Ivelisse|last4 = Scheiner|first4 = Scheiner|editor-last = Fisch|editor-first = Shalom M.|editor2-last = Truglio|editor2-first = Rosemarie T.|chapter = The Varied Role of Formative Research: Case Studies From 30 years}}</ref>

When Lee died, ''Sesame Street'' dealt with his death in what Davis called a "landmark broadcast"<ref name="davis-284"/> aired on [[Thanksgiving (United States)|Thanksgiving Day]] 1983.<ref name="additional cast"/> After that, Mr. Hooper's apprentice [[David (Sesame Street)|David]] ([[Northern Calloway]]) took over as [[Hooper's Store|his store]]'s proprietor until he himself left the show in 1989,<ref name="additional cast"/> and was succeeded by Mr. Handford (played first by [[Leonard Jackson (actor)|Leonard Jackson]] and then by David Smyrl), a former [[firefighter]].<ref name="additional cast"/> The most recent owner of Hooper's Store is [[Alan (Sesame Street)|Alan]], played by [[Alan Muraoka]].<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.sesamestreet.org/parents/theshow/cast/alan-muraoka|title = Alan Muraoka (Alan): Alan's Biography|accessdate = 21 October 2014|website = Sesame Street.org}}</ref> [[Gina Jefferson]] (played by [[Alison Bartlett O'Reilly]])<ref>Davis, p. 291</ref> started on the show as a teenager working at Hooper's Store, later ran a day care center, and eventually became a veterinarian.<ref>Gikow, p. 80</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.sesamestreet.org/parents/theshow/cast/alison-bartlett-oreilly|title = Alison Bartlett O'Reilly: Alison's Biography|accessdate = 23 October 2014|website = Sesame Street.org}}</ref> The most recently introduced human characters on ''Sesame Street'' include Chris ([[Chris Knowings]]), Gordon and Susan's nephew, who works part-time at Hooper's Store;<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.sesamestreet.org/parents/theshow/cast/christopher-lawrence-knowings|title = Christopher Knowings (Christopher): Christopher's Biography|date = |accessdate = 22 October 2014|website = Sesame Street.org}}</ref><ref>Gikow, pp. 62<U+2013>63</ref> Indian-American laundromat owner Leela ([[Nitya Vidyasagar]]);<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.sesamestreet.org/parents/theshow/cast/nitya-vidyasagar|title = Nitya Vidyasagar: Nitya's Biography|accessdate = 29 October 2014|website = Sesame Street.org}}</ref> and Armando (Ismael Cr<U+00FA>z Cordova), an energetic Latino writer and "techie [who] loves his gadgets".<ref>{{Cite news|url = http://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/01/arts/television/a-chameleon-onstage-and-on-tv.html?_r=0|title = A Chameleon Onstage and on TV|last = Grode|first = Eric|date = 30 August 2013|work = The New York Times|accessdate = 21 October 2014}}</ref>

Mr. Noodle, a major character in the "Elmo's World" segment, was played by [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] actor [[Bill Irwin]], who had previously worked with Arlene Sherman (one of the show's executive producers) in short films for ''Sesame Street''.<ref>Herman, event occurs at 3:31</ref> When he became unavailable, Sherman asked her friend [[Michael Jeter]] to replace Irwin as Mr. Noodle's brother Mr. Noodle.<ref>Herman, event occurs at 5:10</ref> Jeter was in the role beginning in 2000, until his death in 2003.<ref name="gikow-169">Gikow, p. 169</ref> [[Kristin Chenoweth]] played Mr. Noodle's sister Ms. Noodle,<ref name="gikow-169"/> and [[Sarah Jones (stage actress)|Sarah Jones]] played Mr. Noodle's other sister Miss Noodle. Writer Louise A. Gikow called the Noodles "a dynasty of mimes...in the tradition of great silent film comedians like [[Charlie Chaplin]], [[Buster Keaton]], and [[Harold Lloyd]]".<ref name="gikow-169"/> They made mistakes, but solved them with the help of "enthusiastic kid voice-overs",<ref name="gikow-169"/> which empowered children and helped them feel smarter than the adults. According to long-time ''Sesame Street'' writer [[Judy Freudberg]], "Mr. Noodle, who never speaks, is all about trial and error. When you throw him a hat, he acts like he's never seen one before. Kids feel empowered watching him because they can do what he can't".<ref>Davis, p. 339</ref>

===Animated characters===

In addition to its "variety of distinctive and reliable personalities",<ref name="lesser-125"/> both Muppet and human, ''Sesame Street'' has also featured a few animated characters throughout its history, who have included (among others) Alice Braithwaite Goodyshoes, "an arrogant, sanctimonious know-it-all",<ref name="lesser-125"/> and the [[Teeny Little Super Guy]], a typical problem solver.<ref>Gikow, pp. 242<U+2014>243</ref> In 2008, Bert and Ernie got their own [[Clay animation|Claymation]] segment called "Bert and Ernie's Great Adventure", in which they explore the world, going on "active adventures in exotic locations", according to ''Sesame Street'' executive producer [[Carol-Lynn Parente]].<ref>{{cite news | last = Moody | first = Annemarie | title = Original Bert and Ernie Claymation Series Debuts on Sesame Street Season 39  | work = Animation World Network  | date = 2008-07-28| url = http://www.awn.com/news/television/original-bert-and-ernie-claymation-series-debuts-sesame-street-season-39 | accessdate = 2011-02-18}}</ref> The following year, Abby Cadabby got her own computer-animated segment, "Abby's Flying Fairy School",<ref>Gikow, p. 234</ref> where she takes fairy training classes from her teacher Mrs. Sparklenose,<ref>{{cite web | title = Sesame Street: First Animated Muppets Made with Autodesk Softimage  | publisher = Computer Graphics World | url = http://www.cgw.com/Press-Center/Web-Exclusives/2009/Sesame-Street-First-Animated-Muppets-Made-with-A.aspx | accessdate = 2011-02-20}}</ref> along with her fellow classmates Gonnigan and Bl<U+00F6>gg.<ref>Gikow, pp. 234<U+2014>235</ref> Additionally, several [[DC Comics]] characters were licensed for use in animated segments on the show during its first season, including [[Batman]]<ref>"Batman Crosses the Street", in ''Old School, Volume 1'' (Disc 1) [DVD] (2006), Children's Television Workshop</ref> and [[Superman]].<ref>"S - Superman", in ''Old School, Volume 1'' (Disc 2) [DVD] (2006), Children's Television Workshop</ref>
