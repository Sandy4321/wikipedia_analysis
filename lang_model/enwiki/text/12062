'''Joan Chandos Baez''' (born January 9, 1941, in [[Staten Island]], [[New York]]) is a [[folk singer]], [[songwriter]] and activist.  She is known for her highly individual vocal style.<ref>[http://www.ecapc.org/articles/WestmoW_2003.02.23.asp http://www.ecapc.org/articles/WestmoW_2003.02.23.asp] ''ecapc.org'' Accessed June 26, 2007</ref> Many of her songs are [[topical song]]s and deal with social issues.

She is perhaps best known for her hit "[[Diamonds & Rust (song)|Diamonds & Rust]]" and her [[cover version|covers]] of  [[Phil Ochs]]'s "[[There but for Fortune (song)|There but for Fortune]]"   and [[The Band]]'s "[[The Night They Drove Old Dixie Down]]" (a top-five single on the [[United States]] charts in 1971), and to a lesser extent, "[[Farewell, Angelina (song)|Farewell, Angelina]]" and "[[Love Is Just a Four-Letter Word]]" <U+2014> along with "[[Joe Hill (song)|Joe Hill]]", "[[Sweet Sir Galahad]]" and "[[We Shall Overcome]]" (three of the songs she performed at the 1969 [[Woodstock Festival]]). 

She remains known for her long relationship with [[Bob Dylan]] and her lifelong passion for activism, notably in the areas of [[nonviolence]], [[civil rights|civil]] and [[human rights]] and, more recently, the [[Environment (biophysical)|environment]].

Baez has performed publicly for over 50 years, released over 30 albums and recorded songs in at least eight languages. She is considered a folk singer although her music has strayed from folk considerably after the 1960s, encompassing everything from [[rock music|rock]] and [[pop music|pop]] to [[country music|country]] and [[gospel music|gospel]]. Although a songwriter herself, especially in the mid-1970s, Baez is most often regarded as an interpreter of other people's work, covering songs by [[The Allman Brothers Band]], [[The Beatles]], [[Jackson Browne]], Dylan, [[Woody Guthrie]], [[The Rolling Stones]], [[Pete Seeger]], [[Paul Simon]], [[Stevie Wonder]] and many other artists. In more recent years, she has found success interpreting songs of diverse songwriters such as [[Ryan Adams]], [[Steve Earle]] and [[Natalie Merchant]]. 

==Family==

Her father, [[Albert Baez]], was born in 1912 in [[Puebla, Puebla|Puebla]], [[Mexico]], and died March 20, 2007.<ref>[http://www.marinij.com/ci_5481711?source=rss http://www.marinij.com/ci_5481711?source=rss] ''Marinij.com''</ref>  His father (Joan's grandfather), the [[Reverend]] Alberto Baez, left [[Catholicism]] to become a [[Methodist]] [[Minister (Christianity)|minister]] and moved to the U.S. when Albert was two years old. Albert grew up in [[Brooklyn]], New York, where his father preached to&nbsp;<U+2014> and advocated for&nbsp;<U+2014> a [[Spanish language|Spanish]]-speaking congregation.<ref>[http://newdeal.feri.org/texts/406.htm http://newdeal.feri.org/texts/406.htm] ''Newdeal.feri.org'' Accessed May 10, 2007</ref> Her father considered becoming a minister as well, before he turned to the study of [[mathematics]] and [[physics]]. He became a physicist (co-inventor of the [[x-ray microscope]]{{<ref>http://www.ndt.net/abstract/ios_rt/data/v7n2a1.htm (abstract refers to Journal of X-Ray Science and Technology, ISSN: 0895-3996.

Her mother, Joan Bridge Baez (often referred to as Joan Senior or "Big Joan" because of sharing her daughter's first name), was born in [[Edinburgh]], [[Scotland]],  the second daughter of an [[Anglicanism|Episcopal]] [[priest]]. Joan Senior and Albert met at a high-school dance in [[Madison, New Jersey|Madison]], [[New Jersey]], and quickly fell in love. After their marriage, the newlyweds moved to [[California]].

Baez had two sisters <U+2014> older sister Pauline and younger sister [[Mimi Fari<U+00F1>a|Mimi]] (1945-2001). 

Pauline married artist [[Brice Marden]] in 1960; they divorced a few years later.  Their son is musician [[Nick Marden]]. Pauline later remarried and has a daughter, Pearl Bryan. 

Mimi became a singer, guitarist, activist, and the founder of the organization [[Mimi Fari<U+00F1>a#Bread and Roses|Bread and Roses]].<ref>[http://www.breadandroses.org http://www.breadandroses.org] Bread and Roses], official website</ref> She first married singer/songwriter [[Richard Fari<U+00F1>a]], who was killed in a motorcycle crash on Mimi's 21st birthday <U+2014> shortly after publishing his only novel. Mimi and Richard were best known for their song "[[Pack up Your Sorrows]]". In 1968, Mimi married Milan Melvin at the [[Big Sur Folk Festival]] at [[Big Sur]], California. Baez wrote the song "Sweet Sir Galahad" about their courtship. Mimi (Fari<U+00F1>a) died of neuroendocrine cancer, at her home in California, on July 18, 2001, at age 56.

Baez has one son, [[Percussion instrument|percussionist]] Gabriel Harris, and is a grandmother to Jasmine, the daughter of Gabriel and his wife, Pamela. Her cousin, Peter Baez, was a [[Medical cannabis|medical marijuana]] activist.<ref>[http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/1998/05/09/MN7196.DTL&hw=Peter+Baez&sn=002&sc=989 San Jose Pot Club Shuts Down Assets seized&nbsp;<U+2014> director faces 6 felony charges] Saturday, May 9, 1998</ref> Another cousin, [[John C.

==Early life==
Because of her father's work in [[health care]] and with [[UNESCO]], the family moved many times, living in towns across the U.S., as well as in [[England]], [[France]], [[Switzerland]], [[Italy]], [[Canada]] and the [[Middle East]], including [[Iraq]], where they stayed in 1951.  She later became involved with a variety of social causes early in her career, including civil rights and non-violence.<ref>http://books.google.com/books?id=p4HKHnYFOzAC&pg=PT236&lpg=PT236&dq=joan+baez+discrimination+mexican&source=bl&ots=rUQXcrOece&sig=ceRw7mmqN6PmofpbgzT1dMUoE8w&hl=en&ei=LamfSZOtHYKEsAOuv_zGCQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&resnum=6&ct=result#PPT236,M1</ref> Social justice, she stated in the PBS series ''American Masters, ''is the true core of her life, looming larger than music.''''

==Music career==
===Early years===
A friend of her father gave her a [[ukulele]]. She learned four chords, which enabled her to play [[rhythm and blues]] songs, the music she was listening to at the time. Her parents, however, were fearful that the music would lead her into a life of drug addiction.<ref name=DemNow>Per Joan Baez, interviewed by [[Amy Goodman]] at Pete Seeger's 90th birthday celebration (May 3, 2009)</ref> At her aunt's behest, Baez at age eight attended a concert by [[folk music]]ian [[Pete Seeger]], and found herself strongly attracted to his music.<ref name=DemNow/> She soon began practicing the songs of his repertoire and performing them publicly. One of her very earliest public performances was at a retreat in [[Saratoga, California]], for a youth group from Temple Beth Jacob, a [[Redwood City, California]], congregation. A short [[8mm film]] of this has recently been found. In 1957, Baez bought her first [[Gibson Guitar Corporation|Gibson]] guitar for [[United States dollar|US$]]50.

===The college music scene in Massachusetts===
In 1958, her father accepted a faculty position at [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]], and moved his family to [[Belmont, Massachusetts|Belmont]], a suburb of [[Boston, Massachusetts|Boston]], [[Massachusetts]]. The area was at the time the center of the up-and-coming folk-music scene, and Baez began [[busking]] locally in Boston and nearby [[Cambridge, Massachusetts|Cambridge]], also performing in clubs, and attending [[Boston University]] (from which she later dropped out).  In 1958, at the [[Club Passim|Club 47]] in Cambridge (which would later become her most-noted venue), she gave her first concert. When designing the poster for the performance, Baez considered changing her performing name to either Rachel Sandperl (Sandperl is the surname of her high-school teacher and long-time mentor, the pacifist scholar [[Ira Sandperl]]) or Mariah (from the song "[[They Call the Wind Mariah]]" popularized by [[The Kingston Trio]].) She later opted against it, fearing that people would accuse her of changing her last name because it was Spanish. The audience consisted of her parents, her sister Mimi, and a small group of friends<U+2014>a grand total of eight patrons. She was paid ten dollars. Baez was later asked back and began performing twice a week for US$20 per show.{{citation needed|date=October 2009}} 

A few months later, Baez and two other folk enthusiasts made plans to record an album in the cellar of a friend's house. The three sang solos and duets, a family friend designed the album cover, and it was released (on Veritas Records) that same year as ''[[Folksingers 'Round Harvard Square]]''. Baez later met [[Bob Gibson (musician)|Bob Gibson]] and the reigning queen of folk music, [[Odetta]], whom Baez cites as a primary influence alongside [[Marian Anderson]] and Seeger. Gibson invited Baez to perform alongside him at the 1959 [[Newport Folk Festival]], where the two sang two duets, "[[Virgin Mary Had One Son]]" and "[[We Are Crossing Jordan River]]". The performance generated substantial praise for the "barefoot Madonna" with the otherworldly voice, and it was this appearance that led to Baez signing with [[Vanguard Records]] the following year{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}} (although not before the more-established label, [[Columbia Records]] tried to sign her).<ref>In her 1987 autobiography, ''And A Voice to Sing With'', pp. 61-62, she describes the afternoon when she met with first Mitch Miller at Columbia, then Maynard Solomon at Vanguard.</ref> Baez later claimed that she felt she would be given more artistic license at a more "low key" label.{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}}

===First albums and 1960s breakthrough===
Her true professional career began at that 1959 Newport Folk Festival; she recorded her first album for a major label (Vanguard), ''[[Joan Baez (album)|Joan Baez]]'' (1960), produced by [[Fred Hellerman]] (of [[The Weavers]]), who produced many albums by folk artists.  The collection of traditional folk [[Ballad (music)|ballads]], blues and [[lament]]s sung to her own guitar accompaniment sold moderately well. It featured many popular [[Child Ballads]] of the day, such as "[[Mary Hamilton]]" and was recorded in only four days in the ballroom of [[New York City]], New York,'s [[Manhattan Towers Hotel]]. The album also included "[[El Preso Numero Nueve]]", a song sung entirely in Spanish. That same song later appeared on her Spanish-language album, ''[[Gracias a la Vida (album)|Gracias a la Vida]]'' (1974).

Her second release, ''[[Joan Baez, Vol. 2]]'' (1961) went "[[Music recording sales certification|gold]]", as did ''[[Joan Baez in Concert|Joan Baez in Concert, Part 1]]'' (1962) and ''[[Joan Baez in Concert, Part 2]]'' (1963). Like its immediate predecessor, ''Joan Baez, Vol. 2'' contained strictly traditional material. Her two albums of live material, ''Joan Baez in Concert, Part 1'' and its second counterpart, were unique in that, unlike most live albums, they contained only new songs, rather than established favorites. It was ''Joan Baez in Concert, Part 2'' that features Baez's first-ever Dylan cover. From the early to mid-1960s, Baez emerged at the forefront of the American [[roots revival]], where she introduced her audiences to the then-unknown Dylan (the two became romantically involved in late 1962, remaining together through early 1965), and was emulated by artists such as [[Judy Collins]], [[Emmylou Harris]],  [[Joni Mitchell]] and [[Bonnie Raitt]].

[[Image:PackupFrench45.jpg|thumb|left|190px|Pack up Your Sorrows, French single, 1966]]

Baez first got a taste of commercial success when the single "There but for Fortune", written by Ochs, became a top-ten hit in the [[United Kingdom]] in 1965. She was profoundly influenced by the music-industry's [[British Invasion]]{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}}  and began augmenting her [[acoustic guitar]] on  ''[[Farewell, Angelina]]'' (1965), which features a number of Dylan songs interspersed with more traditional fare. Deciding to experiment after having exhausted the folksinger-with-guitar format, Baez turned to [[Peter Schickele]], a [[classical music|classical-music]] [[composer]], who provided classical orchestration for her next three albums: ''[[No<U+00EB>l (Joan Baez album)|No<U+00EB>l]]'' (1966), ''[[Joan (album)|Joan]]'' (1967) and ''[[Baptism: A Journey Through Our Time]]'' (1968). ''No<U+00EB>l'' was a [[Christmas]] album of traditional material, while ''Baptism'' was akin to a [[concept album]], featuring Baez reading and singing [[poetry|poems]] written by celebrated poets such as [[James Joyce]], [[Federico Garc<U+00ED>a Lorca]] and [[Walt Whitman]].

In 1968, Baez traveled to [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]], [[Tennessee]], where a marathon recording session resulted in not one, but two albums.  The first, ''[[Any Day Now (Joan Baez album)|Any Day Now]]'' (1968), consists exclusively of Dylan covers (one, "Love Is Just a Four-Letter Word," was never recorded by Dylan and has become a Baez staple).  The other, the country-music-infused ''[[David's Album]]'' (1969) was recorded for husband [[David Harris (protester)|David Harris]], a prominent anti-[[Vietnam War]] protester and organizer eventually imprisoned for [[draft resistance]]. Harris, a country-music fan, turned Baez toward more-complex [[country rock|country-rock]] influences beginning with  ''David's Album''.  ''(See [[Joan Baez#David Harris|David Harris]] section below.)''

In 1968, she  published her first [[memoir]], ''Daybreak'' (by [[Dial Press]]).

In 1969, her appearance at Woodstock in upstate New York afforded her an international musical and political podium, particularly upon the successful release of the [[documentary film]] ''[[Woodstock (film)|Woodstock]]'' (1970).

Beginning in the late 1960s, Baez began writing many of her own songs, beginning with "Sweet Sir Galahad" and "A Song For David" (the latter written after her husband was imprisoned for [[draft dodger|draft evasion]]).

===The 1970s and the end of the Vanguard years===
After eleven years with Vanguard, Baez decided in 1971 to cut ties with the label that had released her albums since her first in 1960. She delivered them one last success with the gold-selling album ''[[Blessed Are...]]'' (1971) which spawned a top-ten hit in [[Robbie Robertson]]'s "The Night They Drove Old Dixie Down", her cover of The Band's signature song.  With ''[[Come from the Shadows]]'' (1972), Baez switched to [[A&M Records]], where she remained for four years and six albums. 

During this period, in late 1971, she reunited with Schickele to record two tracks ("Rejoice in the Sun" and "Silent Running") for the [[science fiction|science-fiction]] film, ''[[Silent Running]]'' (1972). The two songs were issued as a single on Decca (32890). In addition, an LP record (LP-81072) was released on Decca DL7-9188, and was later reissued by Varese Sarabande on green vinyl. In 1998 a limited release on CD by the "Valley Forge Record Groupe" included an additional track with the spoken introduction "God Bless These Gardens". This CD can still be found for sale today.

''[[Where Are You Now, My Son?]]'' (1973) featured a 23-minute title song which took up all of the [[A-side and B-side|B-side]] of the album. Half spoken-word poem and half tape-recorded sounds, the song documented Baez's visit to [[Hanoi]], [[North Vietnam]], in December 1972, during which she and her traveling companions survived a week-long bombing campaign. ''(See [[Joan Baez#Vietnam War|Vietnam War]] section below.)''

''Gracias a la Vida'' (1974) (the title song written and first performed by [[Chile]]an folk singer [[Violeta Parra]]) followed and was a success in both the U.S. and [[Latin America]].  It included the song "[[Cucurrucucu paloma]]". Flirting with mainstream pop music as well as writing her own songs for ''[[Diamonds & Rust]]'' (1975), the album became the highest selling of Baez's career and spawned a second top-ten single in the form of the title track, a nostalgic piece about her ill-fated relationship with Dylan. 

After ''[[Gulf Winds]]'' (1976), an album of entirely self-composed songs, and ''[[From Every Stage]]'' (1976), a live album that had Baez performing songs "from every stage" of her career, Baez again parted ways with a record label when she moved to [[CBS Records]] for ''[[Blowin' Away]]'' (1977) and ''[[Honest Lullaby]]'' (1979).

===The 1980s and 1990s===

In 1980, Baez was given honorary [[Doctor of Humane Letters]] degrees by [[Antioch University]] and [[Rutgers University]] for her political activism and the "universality of her music". 

In 1983, she appeared on the [[Grammy Awards]] for the first time, performing Dylan's anthemic "[[Blowin' in the Wind]]", a song she first performed twenty years earlier. 

Baez also played a significant role in the 1985 [[Live Aid]] concert for [[Africa]]n famine relief, opening the U.S. segment of the show in [[Philadelphia]], [[Pennsylvania]]. She has toured on behalf of many other causes, including [[Amnesty International]]'s 1986 ''[[A Conspiracy of Hope]]'' tour and a guest spot on their subsequent ''[[Human Rights Now!]]'' tour.

Baez found herself without an American label for the release of ''[[Live -Europe '83|Live Europe 83]]'' (1984).  She did not have an American release until ''[[Recently]]'' (1987) on [[Gold Castle Records]]. 

Also in 1987, Baez's second autobiography ''[[And a Voice to Sing With]]'' was published and became a ''[[New York Times]]'' bestseller. That same year, she traveled to the Middle East to visit with and sing songs of peace for the people of [[Israel]], the [[Gaza Strip]], and the [[West Bank]].

In May 1989, Baez performed at a music festival in [[communism|communist]] [[Czechoslovakia]], called [[Bratislavsk<U+00E1> l<U+00FD>ra]]. While there, she met future [[List of Presidents of Czechoslovakia|Czechoslovakian president]] [[V<U+00E1>clav Havel]], whom she let carry her guitar so as to prevent his arrest by government agents. During her performance, she greeted members of [[Charter 77]], a dissident human-rights group, which resulted in her microphone being shut off abruptly. Baez then proceeded to sing ''[[a cappella]]'' for the nearly four thousand gathered. Havel cited her as a great inspiration and influence in that country's [[Velvet Revolution]], the bloodless revolution in which the Soviet-dominated communist government there was overthrown.

Baez recorded two more albums with Gold Castle, ''[[Speaking of Dreams]]'',  (1989) and ''[[Brothers in Arms (Joan Baez album)|Brothers in Arms]]'' (1991).  She then landed a contract with a major label, [[Virgin Records]], recording ''[[Play Me Backwards]]'' (1992) for Virgin shortly before the company was purchased by [[EMI]].  She then switched to Guardian, with whom she produced a live album, ''[[Ring Them Bells]]'' (1995), and a studio album, ''[[Gone from Danger]]'' (1997).

In 1993, at the invitation of [[Refugees International]] and sponsored by the [[Soros Foundation]], she traveled to the war-torn [[Bosnia-Herzegovina]] region of then-[[Yugoslavia]] in an effort to help bring more attention to the suffering there. She was the first major artist to perform in [[Sarajevo]] since the outbreak of the [[Yugoslav wars|Yugoslav civil war]]. 

In October of that year, Baez became the first major artist to perform in a professional concert presentation on [[Alcatraz Island]] (a former [[Federal Bureau of Prisons|U.S. federal prison]]) in [[San Francisco]], California, in a benefit for her sister Mimi's Bread and Roses organization. She later returned for another concert in 1996.

===2000 to present===
'''2001-2005'''
[[Image:bowerysongs.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Joan Baez, ''[[Bowery Songs]]'', Koch Entertainment, 2005]]

In August 2001, Vanguard began re-releasing Baez's first 13 albums, which she recorded for the label between 1960 and 1971. The reissues, being released through Vanguard's Original Master Series, feature digitally restored sound, unreleased bonus songs, new and original artwork, and new [[liner notes|liner-note]] [[essay]]s written by [[Arthur Levy]]. Likewise, her six A&M albums were reissued in 2003.

Beginning in 2001, Baez has had several successful long-term engagements as a lead character at San Francisco's [[Teatro ZinZanni]].<ref name="BaezSFChron">{{cite web |url= http://sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2001/10/12/DD231448.DTL |title= Now it's Countess Baez |author= Steve Winn |work= [[San Francisco Chronicle]] |date= October 12, 2001 |quote= }}</ref>

In 2003, Baez was also a judge for the third annual [[The Independent Music Awards|Independent Music Awards]] to support independent artists' careers.<ref>[http://www.independentmusicawards.com/ima_new/pastjudges.asp Independent Music Awards - Past Judges]</ref>

Her album, ''[[Dark Chords on a Big Guitar]]'' (2003), features songs by composers half her age, while a November 2004 performance at New York City's [[Bowery Ballroom]] was recorded for a live release, ''[[Bowery Songs]]'' (2005).

On October 1, 2005, she performed at the [[Hardly Strictly Bluegrass]] festival, at San Francisco's [[Golden Gate Park]].

'''2006'''

On January 13, 2006, Baez performed at the funeral of [[Lou Rawls]], where she led [[Jesse Jackson|Jesse Jackson, Sr.]], Wonder, and others in the singing of "[[Amazing Grace]]". 

On June 6, 2006, Baez joined [[Bruce Springsteen]] on stage at his San Francisco concert, where the two performed the rolling anthem "[[Pay Me My Money Down]]". 

In September 2006, Baez contributed a live, retooled version of her classic song "Sweet Sir Galahad" to a [[Starbucks]]'s exclusive [[XM Artist Confidential]] album. In the new version, she changed the lyric "here's to the dawn of their days" to "here's to the dawn of ''her'' days," as a tribute to her late sister Mimi, about whom Baez wrote the song in 1969.

On October 8, 2006, she appeared as a special surprise guest at the opening ceremony of the [[Forum 2000]] international conference in [[Prague]], [[Czech Republic]]. Her performance was kept secret from former [[President of the Czech Republic|Czech Republic President]] Havel until the moment she appeared on stage. Havel remains a great admirer of both Baez and her work.  During Baez's next visit to Prague, in April 2007, the two met again when she performed in front of a sell-out house at Prague's [[Lucerna Hall]], a building erected by Havel's grandfather.

On December 2, 2006, she made a guest appearance at the [[Oakland Interfaith Gospel Choir]]'s Christmas Concert at the [[Paramount Theatre (Oakland, California)|Paramount Theatre]] in [[Oakland]], California.  Her participation included versions of "[[Let Us Break Bread Together]]" and "Amazing Grace". She also joined the choir in the finale of "[[O Holy Night]]".

'''2007'''

In February 2007, [[Proper Records]] reissued her live album ''Ring Them Bells'' (1995), which featured duets with songstresses ranging from [[Dar Williams]] and Mimi Fari<U+00F1>a to the [[Indigo Girls]] and [[Mary Chapin Carpenter]]. The reissue features a 16-page booklet and six unreleased live tracks from the original recording sessions, including "[[Love Song To A Stranger|Love Song to a Stranger]]", "[[You Ain't Goin' Nowhere]]", "[[Geordie (song)|Geordie]]", "[[Gracias a la Vida]]", "[[The Water Is Wide (song)|The Water Is Wide]]" and "[[Stones in the Road (song)|Stones in the Road]]", bringing the total tracklisting to 21 songs (on two discs). 

In addition, Baez recorded a duet of "Jim Crow" with [[John Mellencamp]] which appears on his album ''[[Freedom's Road]]'' (2007).  He has called the album a "Woody Guthrie rock album". The recording was heavily influenced by albums from the 1960s, which is why he invited an [[wikt:icon|icon]] from that era to appear with him.{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}}

Also in February 2007, she received the [[Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award]]. The day after receiving the honor, she appeared at the Grammy Awards ceremony and introduced a performance by the [[Dixie Chicks]].

'''2008'''

On June 29, 2008, Baez played out the final set on the Acoustic Stage at the [[Glastonbury Festival 2008|Glastonbury Festival]] in [[Glastonbury]], U.K., to a packed audience.<ref>[http://www.glastonburyfestivals.co.uk/performance.aspx?id=2179#Acoustic_Stage Acoustic Stage]</ref>

On July 6, 2008, she played at the [[Montreux Jazz Festival]] in [[Montreux]], [[Switzerland]]. During the concert's finale, she spontaneously danced on stage with a band of African percussionists.<ref>[http://www.montreuxjazz.com/news/index_fr.aspx Montreux Jazz festival]</ref>

'''2009'''

On July 13, 2009, Baez performed in Layton, Utah at the Ed Kenley Amphitheater as a stop on her 2009 tour. She loved the venue saying on her website that "The venue's staff were remarkably agreeable and friendly and made performing there a real joy. Catering was simply splendid." [http://www.joanbaez.com/ontheroad2009a.html] (Baez had requested Blue Iguana which was delivered to the amphitheater from Salt Lake City.) The love was mutual, many venue staff members saying that Baez was a pleasure to work with. Baez performed in Layton, do largely to the efforts of Dawn Brandvold, Davis County Arts board member and self-confessed Baez superfan. She and her husband have traveled all over to see Baez perform.

==Social and political involvement==
===1950s===
In 1956, Baez first heard a young [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]] speak about nonviolence, civil rights and [[social change]], the speech brought tears to her eyes.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}} Several years later, the two became friends, later marching and [[demonstration (people)|demonstrating]] together on numerous occasions.

In 1957, at age 16, Joan committed her first act of [[civil disobedience]] by refusing to leave her [[Palo Alto High School]] classroom in [[Palo Alto, California|Palo Alto]], California for an [[Civil defense#History|air-raid drill]]. After the bells rang, students were to leave the school, make their way to their home [[air-raid shelter]]s, and pretend they were surviving an [[nuclear warfare|atomic blast]]. <!-- This passage is erroneous as there were no ICBM's in 1957: "Knowing full well that the time it would take to race home would not be enough if a missile were in fact fired from [[Soviet Union]]" --> Protesting what she believed to be misleading government [[propaganda]], Baez refused to leave her seat when instructed and continued reading a book. For this act she was punished by school officials, and was ostracized by the local population for being a supposed "Communist infiltrator."{{She describes all this in the chapter "My Memory's Eye" in her book, 'And a Voice to Sing With'}}

===Civil Rights===

The early years of Joan Baez's career saw the civil-rights movement in the U.S. become a prominent issue.  

Her performance of "We Shall Overcome", the civil-rights anthem written and popularized by Seeger, at King's 1963 [[March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom]] permanently linked her to the song.

Her recording of the song "Birmingham Sunday" (1964) (written by her brother-in-law, Richard  Fari<U+00F1>a) was used in the opening of ''[[4 Little Girls]]'' (1997), [[Spike Lee]]'s documentary film about the four young victims killed in the [[16th Street Baptist Church bombing|1963 bombing]], in [[Birmingham, Alabama|Birmingham]], Alabama, of an African-American church by members of the [[Ku Klux Klan]]. 

Baez joined King on his [[Selma to Montgomery marches|1965 march]] from [[Selma, Alabama|Selma]], [[Alabama]], to [[Montgomery, Alabama|Montgomery]], Alabama, singing for the marchers in the town of [[St. Jude, Alabama|St. Jude]], Alabama, as they camped the night before arriving in Montgomery. 

She linked arms with King to protect [[African American|African-American]] schoolchildren in [[Grenada, Mississippi|Grenada]], [[Mississippi]] who were trying to attend "white" schools.{{Clarify|date=August 2009}}<!--when was this event?-->

Baez again sang "We Shall Overcome" in [[Sproul Plaza]] during the mid-1960s [[Free Speech Movement]] demonstrations at the [[University of California, Berkeley]] in [[Berkeley, California|Berkeley]], California, and at many other rallies and protests. 

In 1966, she stood in the fields alongside [[C<U+00E9>sar Ch<U+00E1>vez]] and California's migrant farm workers as they fought for fair wages and safe working conditions and performed at a benefit on behalf of the [[United Farm Workers]] (UFW) union in December of that year.  In 1972, she was at Ch<U+00E1>vez's side during his 24-day fast to draw attention to the farmworkers' struggle and can be seen singing "We Shall Overcome" during that fast in the film about the UFW, "Si Se Puede" ("It can be done").{{Clarify|date=August 2009}}<!--can't find this film at IMDB; is it a youtube only or something?

===Vietnam War===
Highly visible in civil-rights marches, she became more vocal about her disagreement with the Vietnam War. 

In 1964, she publicly endorsed [[tax resistance|resisting taxes]] by withholding sixty percent <U+2014> the figure commonly determined to fund the military  <U+2014> of her 1963 income taxes. 

In 1964, she founded the [[Institute for the Study of Nonviolence]] (along with her mentor Sandperl) and encouraged draft resistance at her concerts. 

Arrested twice in 1967<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/october/16/newsid_2535000/2535301.stm BBC ON THIS DAY | 16 | 1967: Joan Baez arrested in Vietnam protest<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> for blocking the entrance of the Armed Forces Induction Center in Oakland, California, she spent over a month in jail.  ''(See also [[Joan Baez#David Harris|David Harris]] section below.)''

She was a frequent participant in anti-war marches and rallies, including:

*numerous protests in New York City organized by the [[Fifth Avenue Vietnam Peace Parade Committee]], starting with the March 1966 [[Fifth Avenue Peace Parade]],<ref>{{cite news | title=Antiwar Protests Staged in U.S.; 15 Burn Discharge Papers Here; Hundreds Cheer at Union Square Rally Arrests Made Across the Country 5th Avenue Parade Set Today | author=Douglas Robinson | publisher=''The New York Times'' | date=March 26, 1966}}  Accessed February 3, 2008.</ref>
*a free 1967 concert at the [[Washington Monument]] in [[Washington, D.C.]], that had been opposed by the [[Daughters of the American Revolution]] and which attracted a crowd of 30,000 to hear her anti-war message,<ref>{{cite news | title=30,000 in Capital at Free Concert by Joan Baez; Folk Singer Chides D.A.R., Which Protested U.S. Site | author=B. Drummond Ayres  Jr. | publisher=''The New York Times'' | date=August 15, 1967}} Accessed February 3, 2008.</ref>
*the 1969 [[Moratorium to End the War in Vietnam]] protests,

and many others, culminating in Ochs's [[The War is Over]] celebration in New York City in May 1975.<ref>{{cite news | title=End-of-War Rally Brings Out 50,000; PEACE RALLY HERE BRINGS OUT 50,000 | author=Paul L. Montgomery | publisher=''The New York Times'' | date=May 12, 1975}}  Accessed February 3, 2008.</ref>

During the Christmas season 1972, she joined a peace delegation (which also included prominent human-rights attorney [[Telford Taylor]]) traveling to North Vietnam, both to address human rights in the region, as well as to deliver Christmas mail to American [[Prisoner of war|prisoners of war]]. During her time there, she was caught in the U.S. military's "[[Operation Linebacker II|Christmas bombing]]" of Hanoi, North Vietnam, during which the city was bombed for eleven straight days.

She also devoted a substantial amount of her time in the early 1970s to helping establish a U.S. branch of [[Amnesty International]]. 

Her disquiet at the human-rights violations of communist Vietnam made her increasingly critical of its government and she organized the May 30, 1979, publication, of a full-page advertisement (published in four major U.S. newspapers)<ref>{{cite news | title=Joan Baez starts protest on repression by Hanoi | publisher=''The New York Times'' | date=May 30, 1979 | page=A14}}  Accessed February 3, 2008.</ref> in which the communists were described as having created a nightmare, which put her at odds with a large segment of the U.S. [[left-wing politics|left wing]], who were uncomfortable criticizing a leftist [[regime|r<U+00E9>gime]]. In a letter of response, [[Jane Fonda]] said she was unable to substantiate the "claims" Baez made regarding the atrocities being committed by the [[Cambodia]]n [[Khmer Rouge]].

===Human rights===
Her experiences regarding Vietnam's human-rights violations ultimately led Baez to found her own human-rights group, [[Humanitas International]], whose focus was to target oppression wherever it occurred, criticizing right- and left-wing r<U+00E9>gimes equally.  

She toured Chile, [[Brazil]] and [[Argentina]] in 1981, but was prevented from performing in any of the three countries, for fear her criticism of their human-rights practices would reach mass audiences if she were given a podium. While there, she was surveiled and subjected to death threats. (A film of the ill-fated tour, ''[[There but for Fortune (film)|There but for Fortune]]'', was shown on [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]] in 1982.) 

In a second trip to [[Southeast Asia]], Baez assisted in an effort to take food and medicine into the western regions of Cambodia, and participated in a [[United Nations Humanitarian Conference on Kampuchea]] (Cambodia).

On July 17, 2006, Baez received the Distinguished Leadership Award from the Legal Community Against Violence. At the annual dinner event they honored her for her lifetime of work against violence of all kinds.

===Gay and lesbian rights===

Baez has also been prominent in the struggle for gay and lesbian rights. In 1978, she performed at several benefit concerts to defeat [[Briggs Initiative|Proposition 6]] ("the Briggs Initiative"), which proposed banning all gay people from teaching in the public schools of California. Later that same year, she participated in memorial marches for the assassinated San Francisco city supervisor, [[Harvey Milk]] who was openly gay. 

In the 1990s, she appeared with her friend [[Janis Ian]] at a benefit for the [[National Gay and Lesbian Task Force]], a gay lobbying organization, and performed at the San Francisco Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender Pride March. 

Her song "[[Altar Boy and the Thief]]" from ''[[Blowin' Away]]'' (1977) was written as a dedication to her gay fanbase.

===Environmental causes===
On Earth Day 1998, Baez and her friend Raitt were hoisted by a giant crane to the top of a redwood tree to visit environmental activist [[Julia Butterfly Hill]],<ref>[http://www.geocities.com/Rainforest/vines/9901/bonnie.html http://www.geocities.com/Rainforest/vines/9901/bonnie.html] ''Geocities.com''</ref> who had camped out in the ancient tree in order to protect it from loggers.

===War in Iraq===
In early 2003, Baez performed at two rallies of hundreds of thousands of people in San Francisco protesting the U.S. invasion of Iraq (as she had earlier done before smaller crowds in 1991 to protest the [[Gulf War|Persian Gulf War]]). 

In August 2003, she was invited by Emmylou Harris (who also credits her as a primary influence) and Earle to join them in [[London]], U.K., at the [[Concert For a Landmine-Free World]]. 

In the summer of 2004, she joined [[Michael Moore]]'s "[[Slacker Uprising Tour]]" on American college campuses, encouraging young people to get out and vote for peace candidates in the upcoming national election. 

In August 2005, Baez appeared at the Texas anti-war protest that had been started by [[Cindy Sheehan]].  

The following month, she sang "[[Swing Low, Sweet Chariot]]" and "Amazing Grace" at the Temple in [[Burning Man#Black Rock City|Black Rock City]] during the annual [[Burning Man]] festival as part of a tribute to [[New Orleans]], [[Louisiana]], and the victims of [[Hurricane Katrina]], and during that month she also performed several songs at the [[Operation Ceasefire (protest)|Operation Ceasefire]] rally<ref>[http://zmagsite.zmag.org/Nov2005/gjep1105.html http://zmagsite.zmag.org/Nov2005/gjep1105.html] ''Zmagsite.zmag.org''</ref> against the Iraq War in Washington, DC.

===Opposing the death penalty===
In December 2005, Baez appeared and sang "Swing Low, Sweet Chariot" at the California protest at the [[San Quentin State Prison]] against the execution of [[Tookie Williams]].<ref>[http://www.indybay.org/newsitems/2005/12/13/17899151.php http://www.indybay.org/newsitems/2005/12/13/17899151.php] ''Indybay.org''</ref>  She had previously performed the same song at San Quentin at the 1992 vigil protesting the execution of [[Robert Alton Harris]], the first man to be executed in California after the [[capital punishment|death penalty]] was reinstated.

===Poverty===
On May 23, 2006, Baez once again joined Julia "Butterfly" Hill, this time in a "tree sit" in a giant tree on the site of the [[South Central Farm]] in a poor neighborhood of downtown [[Los Angeles]], California. Baez and Hill were hoisted into the tree, where they remained overnight. The women, in addition to many other activists and celebrities, were protesting the imminent eviction of the community farmers and demolition of the site, which is the largest urban farm in the state. Because many of the South Central Farmers are immigrants from [[Central America]], Baez sang several songs from her 1974 Spanish-language album, ''Gracias a la Vida'', including the title track and "No Nos Mover<U+00E1>n" ("[[We Shall Not Be Moved]]").

===2008 Presidential election===
Throughout most of her career, Baez remained apprehensive about involving herself in [[party politics]].  However, on February 3, 2008, Baez wrote a letter to the editor at the ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'' endorsing [[Barack Obama]] in the [[United States presidential election, 2008|2008 U.S. presidential election]]. She noted: "Through all those years, I chose not to engage in party politics.... At this time, however, changing that posture feels like the responsible thing to do. If anyone can navigate the contaminated waters of Washington, lift up the poor, and appeal to the rich to share their wealth, it is Sen. Barack Obama."<ref>{{cite news |first=Joan |last=Baez|title=Leader on a new journey|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2008/02/03/ED50UO8QM.DTL|publisher=San Francisco Chronicle |date=February 3, 2008 |accessdate=February 3, 2008 }}</ref> 

Playing at the Glastonbury Festival in June, Baez said during the introduction of a song that one reason she likes Obama is because he reminds her of another old friend of hers:  Martin Luther King, Jr.<ref>{{cite web| last = Mills| first = Paul| title = Joan Baez| work = Review| publisher = [[Glastonbury Festival]]| date = 2008| url = http://www.glastonburyfestivals.co.uk/glastonline2008.aspx?id=3443 |accessdate=July 27, 2008 }}</ref>  

Although a highly political figure throughout most of her career, Baez had never publicly endorsed a major political party candidate prior to Obama.

===Iran's people===
On June 25, 2009, Joan Baez made a special version of "We Shall Overcome" with a few lines of [[Persia]]n ([[Farsi]]) [[lyrics]] in support of peaceful protests by Iranian people. She recorded it in her house, and posted the video on [[YouTube]]<ref> [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVCqPAzI-JY]</ref> and also in her personal website.

==Personal life==
===Early relationships===
Baez's first real boyfriend <U+2014> and first lover <U+2014> was a young man, Michael New, whom she met at college. Years later in 1979, he inspired her song "Michael". New was a fellow student from [[Trinidad]], [[West Indies]], who, like Baez, attended classes only occasionally. The two spent a considerable amount of time together, but Baez was unable to balance her blossoming career and her relationship. The two bickered and made up repeatedly, but it was apparent to Baez that New was beginning to resent her success and newfound local celebrity. One night she saw him kissing another woman on a street corner. The relationship remained intact for several years, long after the two moved to California together in 1960.

===Bob Dylan===
[[Image:Joan Baez Bob Dylan.jpg|thumb|right|270px|Joan Baez with [[Bob Dylan]], August 1963.]]

Baez first met Dylan in 1961 at [[Gerde's Folk City]] in New York City's [[Greenwich Village]]. At the time, Baez had already released her d<U+00E9>but album and her popularity as the emerging "Queen of Folk" was on the rise. Baez was initially unimpressed with the "urban [[hillbilly]]," but was impressed with one of Dylan's first compositions, "[[Song to Woody]]," and remarked that she would like to record it (although she never did). 

At the start, Dylan was more interested in Baez's younger sister, Mimi, but under the glare of media scrutiny that began to surround Baez and Dylan, their relationship began to develop into something more. 

By 1963, Baez had already released three albums, two of which had been certified "gold," and she invited Dylan on stage to perform alongside her at the Newport Folk Festival. The two performed the Dylan composition "[[With God on Our Side]]," a performance that set the stage for many more duets like it in the months and years to come. Typically while on tour, Baez would invite Dylan to sing on stage partly by himself and partly with her, much to the chagrin of her fans. 

Before meeting Dylan, Baez's topical songs were few and far between: "[[Last Night I Had the Strangest Dream]]," "We Shall Overcome," and an assortment of [[negro spirituals]]. Baez would later say that Dylan's songs seemed to update the topics of protest and justice.

By the time of Dylan's 1965 tour of the U.K., their relationship had slowly begun to fizzle out after their having been romantically involved off and on for nearly two years. The tour and simultaneous disintegration of their relationship was documented in [[D.A. Pennebaker]]'s documentary film ''[[Dont Look Back]]''<!--[sic]--> (1967). 

[[Image:Joan Baez 1963.jpg|260px|left|thumb|Joan Baez in 1963.]]

Despite the bad blood, the pair eventually buried the hatchet and toured together as part of Dylan's [[Rolling Thunder Revue]] in 1975-76. Baez also starred as the "Woman In White" in Dylan's film ''[[Renaldo and Clara]]'' (1978). 

Dylan and Baez (plus [[Carlos Santana]]) toured together again in 1984. 

Her later reflections on this relationship appear in [[Martin Scorsese]]'s documentary film ''[[No Direction Home]]'' (2005).

Baez penned at least two songs about Dylan. In "[[To Bobby]]", written in 1972, she urged Dylan to return to political activism, while in "Diamonds & Rust," the title track from her 1975 album, she revisited her feelings for him in warm, yet direct terms.<ref name = Gray>{{cite book | last = Gray | first = Michael | authorlink = Michael Gray | title = The Bob Dylan Encyclopedia | publisher = The Continuum International Publishing Group Ltd | location = London | year = 2006 | pages = 30<U+2013>31 | isbn = 0-8264-6933-7}}</ref> 

References to Baez in Dylan's songs are far less clear. Baez herself has suggested that she was the subject of both "Visions of Johanna" and "Mama, You Been on My Mind," although the latter was more likely about his relationship with [[Suze Rotolo]].<ref>Gray p 30</ref><ref name = Heylin>{{cite book | last = Heylin | first = Clinton | title = Behind the Shades Revisited | publisher = HarperEntertainment | location = London | year = 2003 | pages = 158<U+2013>159 | isbn = 0-06-052569-X}}</ref> As for "Visions of Johanna," "She Belongs to Me" and other songs alleged to have been written about Baez, neither Dylan nor biographers such as Clinton Heylin and [[Michael Gray]] have had anything definitive to say one way or the other regarding the subject of these songs.

===David Harris===
[[Image:BAez.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Joan Baez's 1975 bestseller ''[[Diamonds & Rust]]''.]]

In October 1967, Baez, her mother, and nearly seventy other women were arrested at the Oakland, California, Armed Forces Induction Center for blocking the doorways of the building to prevent entrance by young inductees, and in support of young men who refused [[conscription|military induction]]. They were incarcerated in the [[Santa Rita Jail]], and it was here that Baez met David Harris, who was kept on the men's side but who still managed to visit with Baez regularly. 

The two formed a close bond upon their release and Baez moved into his draft-resistance [[Commune (intentional community)|commune]] in the hills above [[Stanford, California|Stanford]], California. The pair had only known each other for three months when they decided to wed. After confirming the news to [[Associated Press|The Associated Press]], media outlets began dedicating ample press to the impending nuptials (at one point, ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine referred to it as the "Wedding of the Century".)

After finding a [[pacifist]] preacher, a church outfitted with peace signs and perfecting a blend of [[Episcopal Church in the United States of America|Episcopalian]] and Quaker wedding vows, Baez and Harris married in New York City on March 26, 1968. Her good friend [[Judy Collins]] sang at the ceremony. 

After the wedding, Joan Baez-Harris and her husband moved into a home in the Los Altos Hills on 10 acres (four hectares) of land called Struggle Mountain, part of a commune, where they tended gardens and were strict [[vegetarians]]. 

A short time later, Harris refused induction to the armed forces and was indicted. On July 15, 1969, a patrol car came rumbling up to Struggle Mountain and carried Harris away, leaving Baez alone <U+2014> and pregnant.  She was very visibly pregnant in public in the months that followed, most notably at Woodstock Festival, where she performed a handful of songs in the early morning. 

[http://www.newfilmco.com/CIOpage.htm <U+201C>Carry It On<U+201D>] a documentary film was produced during this time by The New Film Company, Inc. and had a theatrical release in 1970.  The film gives a unique behind-the-scenes view of Harris<U+2019>s arrest and of Baez in intimate and personal moments on her subsequent tour. 

Among the Baez compositions written about this strained time of her life are "A Song For David", "Myths", "Prison Trilogy (Billy Rose)" and "Fifteen Months" (the amount of time Harris was imprisoned.)  

Their son, Gabriel Harris, was born in December 1969.

Harris was released from his [[Texas]] prison, but the relationship began to dissolve amicably and the couple divorced in 1973. They shared custody of Gabriel, who primarily lived with his mother.<ref>{{cite news | title=Joan Baez Sues for a Divorce | author=James F. Clarity | publisher=''The New York Times'' | date=March 27, 1973 | page=43 | accessdate=February 3, 2008}}</ref> The split was due in large part to her belief that she expressed this way in her autobiography: "I am made to live alone." <ref name=AVoice>Baez, Joan, 1987. And a Voice to Sing With: A Memoir. New York: Summit Books, p.160. ISBN 0-671-40062-2</ref>  She has never remarried.

===Later-life relationships===
She dated [[Apple Inc.|Apple Computer]] cofounder [[Steve Jobs]] during the late 1970s and early 1980s. A number of sources (including biographer Jeffrey Young) have stated that Jobs had considered asking Baez to marry him, except that her age at the time (early 40s) made the possibility of their having children unlikely.<ref>[http://www.amazon.com/dp/0471720836]</ref> Baez mentioned Jobs in the acknowledgments in her 1987 memoir ''And a Voice to Sing With''.

Baez was also romantically linked with [[Mickey Hart]] of the [[Grateful Dead]] for a time during the 1980s.<ref>[http://mog.com/music/Mickey_Hart/biography]</ref>

* "Here's To You" (music by [[Ennio Morricone]], lyrics by Baez), a song Baez originally performed for the [[Italy|Italian]] film ''[[Sacco e Vanzetti]]'' (1971), became a [[hymn]] for the 1960s and 1970s civil-rights movement. It also appears on the movie soundtrack for the film ''[[The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou]]'' (2004). The song is also played over the credits of the quasi-documentary film ''[[Deutschland im Herbst]]'' (1977) and was just recently used in the video game: ''[[Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots]]''.
* Cartoonist [[Al Capp]], creator of the [[comic strip]] ''[[Li'l Abner]]'', expressed his right-wing views during the 1960s by satirizing Baez as a folk singer he called "Joanie Phoanie". Joanie was an unabashed communist radical who sang songs of [[class warfare]] <U+2013> while hypocritically traveling in a [[limousine]] and charging outrageous performance fees to impoverished orphans. [http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,843312,00.html] Capp had this character singing bizarre songs such as "A Tale of Bagels and Bacon" and "Molotov Cocktails for Two".  Although Baez was upset by the parody in 1966, she admits to being more amused in recent years.  "I wish I could have laughed at this at the time", she wrote in a caption under one of the strips, reprinted in her autobiography.  "Mr. Capp confused me considerably.  I'm sorry he's not alive to read this, it would make him chuckle," (from ''And A Voice To Sing With'', 1987).<ref>[http://www.upi.com/topic/Al_Capp/ UPI Photo/Files Jan. 11, 1967]</ref>
* The comedy album ''[[National Lampoon, Inc.|National Lampoon's Radio Dinner]]'' (1972) includes a Baez parody, "Pull the Triggers, Niggers" (deliberately misspelled as "Pull the Tregroes" on the album's outside liner notes), performed by Baez sound-alike [[Diana Reed]].  The satiric song made specific reference to Baez's ex-boyfriend Dylan's defense of [[Black Panther Party|Black Panther]] and convicted murderer, [[George Jackson (Black Panther)|George Jackson]].
* In a 2003 episode of the [[HBO]] series ''[[Six Feet Under (TV series)|Six Feet Under]]'', a character, after watching the film ''Silent Running'', comments "I've always loved Joan Baez." Baez's song "Rejoice In The Sun" can be heard in the background.
* In an episode of the 1970s television series ''[[The Partridge Family]]'', [[David Cassidy]]'s character  says "One lousy sit-in and suddenly she's Joan Baez."
* Baez has been lampooned multiple times on ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' by comedienne [[Nora Dunn]]. One [[sketch comedy|skit]] features a [[game show]] entitled ''Make Joan Baez Laugh!'' where a dour Baez is ushered onstage while celebrity guests try their hand at getting her to a crack a smile.
* Her name appears under the "Special thanks" section of [[Michael Moore]]'s documentary film ''[[Fahrenheit 9/11]]'' (2004); Baez dedicated her album ''[[Dark Chords on a Big Guitar]]'' (2003) to Moore.
* A humorous song by the [[punk rock|punk]] band [[The Dead Milkmen]], "In Praise of Sha Na Na", features the sardonic line, "I don't care about Joan Baez, 'cause [[Sha Na Na]] can wear my fez."
* Baez was featured in the [[Joan Didion]] essay "Where the Kissing Never Stops" (1966) in Dideon's compliation ''[[Slouching Towards Bethlehem]]'' (1968).
* In the [[Todd Haynes]] Dylan [[biopic]] ''[[I'm Not There]]'' (2007), a character clearly based on her was portrayed by [[Julianne Moore]].
* In the television series ''[[Arrested Development (TV series)|Arrested Development]]'', George Bluth, Sr. claims that his twin brother Oscar's song "All You Need Are Smiles" made Baez call him the shallowest man in the world.
* In the television series ''[[Scrubs (TV series)|Scrubs]]'', [[J.D. (Scrubs)|J.D.]] describes one of his patients as being able to sing "like a young Joan Baez".
* She is mentioned in [[Weezer]]'s song "Heart Songs" from their 2008 [[Weezer (2008 album)|self-titled album]].
