'''Ceres''', [[Minor planet designation|formal designation]] '''1 Ceres''', is the smallest identified [[dwarf planet]] in the [[Solar System]] and the only one in the [[asteroid belt]]. It was discovered on 1 January 1801, by [[Giuseppe Piazzi]],<ref name="hoskin" /> and is named after the [[Roman mythology|Roman goddess]] [[Ceres (Roman mythology)|Ceres]] &mdash; the goddess of growing plants, the harvest, and motherly love.

With a diameter of about 950&nbsp;[[km]] (590 miles), Ceres is by far the [[List of notable asteroids|largest]] and most massive body in the [[asteroid belt]], and contains a third (32%) of the belt's total [[mass]].<!-- 32% = 4.753<U+00B1>0.007 <U+00F7> 15<U+00B1>2 (E-10 solar masses) --><ref name="Pitjeva04b">Pitjeva, E.

==Discovery==
The idea that an unknown planet could exist between the orbits of [[Mars]] and [[Jupiter]] was first suggested by [[Johann Elert Bode]] in 1768.<ref name="hoskin" /> His considerations were based on the so called [[Titius-Bode law]], a now-abandoned theory which had been proposed by [[Johann Daniel Titius]] in 1766.<ref name="hoskin" /><ref name="Hogg1948">{{cite journal|last=Hogg|first=Helen Sawyer|title=The Titius-Bode Law and the Discovery of Ceres|journal=Journal of the Royal Astronomical Society of Canada|volume=242|pages=241&ndash;246|year=1948| url=http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1948JRASC..42..241S}}</ref> According to this law, the semi-major axis of the planet should be near 2.8 [[Astronomical unit|AU]].<ref name="Hogg1948" /> [[William Herschel]]'s discovery of [[Uranus]] in 1781<ref name="hoskin" /> increased faith in the law of Titius and Bode, and in 1800, twenty-four experienced astronomers combined their efforts and began a methodical search for the proposed planet.<ref name="hoskin" /><ref name="Hogg1948" /> The group was headed by [[Franz Xaver, Baron von Zach|Franz Xaver von Zach]], editor of the ''Monatliche Correspondenz''. While they did not discover Ceres, they later found several large [[asteroid]]s.<ref name="Hogg1948" />
[[File:Piazzi Cerere.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Piazzi's Book ''"Della scoperta del nuovo pianeta Cerere Ferdinandea"'' outlining the discovery of Ceres]]

Ceres was discovered on 1 January 1801, by [[Giuseppe Piazzi]], who was searching for a star listed by [[Francis Wollaston (1737-1815)|Francis Wollaston]] as Mayer 87 because it was not in [[Tobias Mayer|Mayer's]] zodiacal catalogue in the position given.<ref name="hoskin">{{cite web|last=Hoskin|first=Michael|date=1992-06-26|url=http://www.astropa.unipa.it/HISTORY/hoskin.html|title=Bodes' Law and the Discovery of Ceres|publisher=Observatorio Astronomico di Palermo "Giuseppe S. Vaiana"|accessdate=2007-07-05 }}</ref> Instead of a star, Piazzi found a moving star-like object, which he first thought was a [[comet]].<ref name="Forbes1971">{{cite journal|last=Forbes|first=Eric G.|title=Gauss and the Discovery of Ceres|journal=Journal for the History of Astronomy|volume=2|pages=195&ndash;199|year=1971| url=http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1971JHA.....2..195F}}</ref> Piazzi observed Ceres a total of 24 times, the final time on 11 February 1801, when illness interrupted his observations. He announced his discovery on 24 January 1801 in letters to fellow astronomers, among them his compatriot [[Barnaba Oriani]] of [[Milan]]. He reported it as a comet but "since its movement is so slow and rather uniform, it has occurred to me several times that it might be something better than a comet".<ref name="hoskin" /> In April, Piazzi sent his complete observations to Oriani, [[Johann Elert Bode]], and [[J<U+00E9>r<U+00F4>me Lalande]] in [[Paris]]. The information was published in the September 1801 issue of the ''Monatliche Correspondenz''.<ref name="Forbes1971" />

Soon after this, Ceres' apparent position had changed (mostly due to the Earth's orbital motion). It then appeared too close to the Sun's glare, so other astronomers could not confirm the observations of Piazzi until the end of the year. However after such a long time it was difficult to predict its exact position. To recover Ceres, [[Carl Friedrich Gauss]], then 24 years old, developed an efficient method of orbit determination.<ref name="Forbes1971" /> In only a few weeks, he predicted its path and sent his results to von Zach. On 31 December 1801, von Zach and [[Heinrich W. M. Olbers]] found Ceres near the predicted position and thus recovered it.<ref name="Forbes1971" />

In 1802, Herschel estimated Ceres to be 260 km in diameter, and in 1811 [[Johann Hieronymus Schr<U+00F6>ter]] estimated Ceres to be 2,613 km in diameter.<ref>{{cite web

==Name==
Piazzi originally suggested the name ''Ceres Ferdinandea'' ([[Italian people|Ital<U+00AD>ian]], ''Cerere Ferdinan<U+00AD>dea'') for this body, after both the mythological figure [[Ceres (Roman mythology)|Ceres]] ([[Roman mythology|Roman goddess]] of plants) and [[Ferdinand I of the Two Sicilies|King Ferdinand]] of [[Kingdom of the Two Sicilies|Two Sicilies]].<ref name="hoskin" /><ref name="Forbes1971" /> "Ferdinandea" was not acceptable to other nations of the world and was thus dropped.

The classification of Ceres has changed more than once and has been the subject of some disagreement. [[Johann Elert Bode]] believed Ceres to be the "missing planet" he had proposed to exist between [[Mars]] and [[Jupiter]], at a distance of 419 million&nbsp;km (2.8&nbsp;[[Astronomical unit|AU]]) from the Sun.<ref name="hoskin" /> Ceres was assigned a planetary symbol, and [[Planet#Former classifications|remained listed as a planet]] in astronomy books and tables (along with [[2 Pallas]], [[3 Juno]] and [[4 Vesta]]) for about half a century until further asteroids were discovered.<ref name="hoskin" /><ref name="Forbes1971" /><ref name="Hilton" />

However, as other objects were discovered in the area it was realised that Ceres represented the first of a class of many similar bodies.<ref name="hoskin" /> Sir [[William Herschel]] coined in 1802 the term ''asteroid'' ("star-like") for such bodies,<ref name="Hilton">{{cite web| url=http://aa.usno.navy.mil/faq/docs/minorplanets.php|first=James L.|last=Hilton|title=When Did the Asteroids Become Minor Planets?|date=2001-09-17|accessdate=2006-08-16}}</ref> writing "they resemble small stars so much as hardly to be distinguished from them, even by very good telescopes".<ref>{{cite web| url=http://links.jstor.org/sici?sici=0261-0523%281802%2992%3C213%3AOOTTLD%3E2.0.CO%3B2-R|first=William|last=Herschel|authorlink=William Herschel| title=''Observations on the two lately discovered celestial Bodies.''|date=May 6, 1802}}</ref> As the first such body to be discovered, it was given the designation 1 Ceres under the modern system of [[Asteroid#Naming asteroids|asteroid numbering]].<ref name="Hilton" />

The 2006 debate surrounding [[Pluto]] and what constitutes a 'planet' led to Ceres being considered for reclassification as a planet.<ref>{{cite web |last=Battersby |first=Stephen |date=2006-08-16 |url=http://space.newscientist.com/article/dn9762 |title =Planet debate: Proposed new definitions |publisher=New Scientist |accessdate = 2007-04-27}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|first=Steve| last=Connor |title=Solar system to welcome three new planets |publisher=NZ Herald |date=2006-08-16

By this definition, Ceres is not a planet (because it shares its orbit with the thousands of other asteroids in the [[asteroid belt|main belt]]) and is now classified as a "[[dwarf planet]]" (along with Pluto, {{Dp|Makemake}}, {{Dp|Haumea}} and {{Dp|Eris}}). The issue of whether Ceres remains an asteroid was not addressed.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.iau.org/Q_A2.415.0.html|title=Question and answers 2|publisher=IAU|accessdate=2008-01-31}} <U+2014> Q: What is Ceres?

===Surface===

The surface composition of Ceres is broadly similar to that of [[C-type asteroid]]s.<ref name="Rivkin2006" /> However, some differences do exist. The ubiquitous features in the [[IR]] [[spectrum|spectra]] of Ceres are that of hydrated materials, which indicates the presence of significant amounts of water in the interior of this body. Other possible surface constituents include [[iron]]-rich [[clay]]s ([[cronstedtite]]) and [[carbonate]]s ([[dolomite]] and [[siderite]]), which are common minerals in [[carbonaceous chondrite]] meteorites.<ref name="Rivkin2006" /> The spectral features of carbonates and clay are usually absent in the spectra of other C-type asteroids.<ref name="Rivkin2006">{{cite journal|last=Rivkin|first=A. S.|coauthors=Volquardsen, E. L.; Clark, B. E.|title=The surface composition of Ceres:Discovery of carbonates and iron-rich clays|journal=Icarus|volume=185|page=563-567 |year=2006|doi=10.1016/j.icarus.2006.08.022| url=http://irtfweb.ifa.hawaii.edu/~elv/icarus185.563.pdf|format=PDF|accessdate=2007-12-08}}</ref> Sometimes Ceres is classified as [[G-type asteroid]].<ref name="Parker2002" />

The surface of Ceres is relatively warm. The maximum temperature with the [[Sun]] overhead was estimated from measurements to be 235&nbsp;[[kelvin|K]] (about &minus;38 <U+00B0>[[Celsius|C]]) on May 5, 1991.<ref name="Saint-Pe1993" /> Taking into account also the [[heliocentric]] distance at the time, this gives an estimated maximum of about 239&nbsp;K at [[perihelion]]. 

[[File:Ceres Cutaway.jpg|left|thumb|250px|Diagram showing internal structure of Ceres]]

Only a few features have been unambiguously detected on the surface of Ceres. High resolution [[ultraviolet]] [[Hubble Space Telescope]] images taken in 1995 showed a dark spot on its surface which was nicknamed "Piazzi" in honour of the discoverer of Ceres.<ref name="Parker2002" /> This was thought to be a crater. Later [[near-infrared]] images with a higher resolution taken over a whole rotation with the [[Keck telescope]] using [[adaptive optics]] showed several bright and dark features moving with the dwarf planet's rotation.<ref name="Carry2008" /><ref name="Keck" /> Two dark features had circular shapes and are presumably craters; one of them was observed to have a bright central region, while another was identified as the "Piazzi" feature.<ref name="Carry2008">{{cite journal|first=Benoit|last=Carry|coauthors=''et al.''|title=Near-Infrared Mapping and Physical Properties of the Dwarf-Planet Ceres|year=2007|month=November|journal=Astronomy & Astrophysics|volume=478|page=235-244|url=http://www2.keck.hawaii.edu/inst/people/conrad/nsfGrantRef/2007-arXiv-Benoit.Carry.pdf |format=PDF|doi=10.1051/0004-6361:20078166}}</ref><ref name="Keck" /> More recent visible light [[Hubble Space Telescope]] images of a full rotation taken in 2003 and 2004 showed 11 recognizable surface features, the nature of which are currently unknown.<ref name="Li2006">{{cite journal|last=Li|first=Jian-Yang|coauthors=McFadden, Lucy A.; Parker, Joel Wm.|title=Photometric analysis of 1 Ceres and surface mapping from HST observations|journal=Icarus|volume=182|pages=143&ndash;160|year=2006|doi=10.1016/j.icarus.2005.12.012| url=http://www.astro.umd.edu/~jyli/publications/2006.Icar.182.143.pdf|format=PDF|accessdate=2007-12-08}}</ref><ref name="Hubbl12003-4">{{cite news| url=http://hubblesite.org/newscenter/newsdesk/archive/releases/2005/27/|title=Largest Asteroid May Be 'Mini Planet' with Water Ice|date=2005-09-07|accessdate=2006-08-16|publisher=HubbleSite}}</ref> One of these features corresponds to the "Piazzi" feature observed earlier.<ref name="Li2006" />

These last observations also determined that Ceres' north pole points in the direction of [[right ascension]] 19&nbsp;h 24&nbsp;min (291<U+00B0>), [[declination]] +59<U+00B0>, in the [[constellation]] [[Draco (constellation)|Draco]]. This means that Ceres' [[axial tilt]] is very small&mdash;about 3<U+00B0>.<ref name="Thomas2005" /><ref name="Li2006" />

===Atmosphere===

There are indications that Ceres may have a tenuous [[Celestial body atmosphere|atmosphere]] and water [[frost]] on the surface.<ref name="Ahearn1992">{{cite journal|last=A<U+2019>Hearn|first=Michael F.|coauthors=Feldman, Paul D.|title=Water vaporization on Ceres|journal=Icarus|volume=98|page=54-60|year=1992|doi=10.1016/0019-1035(92)90206-M|url= http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1992Icar...98...54A|accessdate=2007-12-08}}</ref> Surface water ice is not stable at distances less than 5 AU from the Sun,<ref name=frost>{{cite web |date=2008-11-13 |title=Hubble Directly Observes Planet Orbiting Fomalhaut |publisher=Hubblesite |url=http://hubblesite.org/newscenter/archive/releases/2008/39/full/ |accessdate=2009-07-02}}</ref> so it is expected to sublimate if is exposed directly to solar radiation. Water ice can migrate from the deep layers of Ceres to the surface, but will escape in a very short time. As a result, it is difficult to detect water vaporization. Water escaping from Ceres's polar regions was possibly observed in the early 90s but this has not been unambiguously proven. It may be possible to detect escaping water from the surroundings of a fresh impact crater or from cracks in the sub-surface layers of Ceres.<ref name="Carry2008" /> [[Ultraviolet]] observations by [[IUE]] spacecraft detected statistically significant [[hydroxide]] water vapour near the Cererean north pole.<ref name="Ahearn1992" />

==Orbit==
[[File:Ceres Orbit.svg|thumb|left|300px|Orbit of Ceres]]
Ceres follows an orbit between Mars and Jupiter, within the main [[asteroid belt]], with a period of 4.6 Earth years. The orbit is moderately inclined (''i'' = 10.6<U+00B0> compared to 7<U+00B0> for Mercury and 17<U+00B0> for Pluto) and moderately [[Orbital eccentricity|eccentric]] (''e'' = 0.08 compared to 0.09 for Mars).<ref name="jpl_sbdb" />

The diagram illustrates the orbits of Ceres (blue) and several planets (white/grey). The segments of orbits below the ecliptic are plotted in darker colours, and the orange plus sign is the Sun's location. The top left diagram is a polar view that shows the location of Ceres in the gap between Mars and Jupiter. The top right is a close-up demonstrating the locations of the [[pericenter|perihelia]] (q) and [[apocenter|aphelia]] (Q) of Ceres and Mars. The perihelion of Mars is on the opposite side of the Sun from those of Ceres and several of the large main belt asteroids, including [[2 Pallas]] and [[10 Hygiea]]. The bottom diagram is a perspective view showing the inclination of the orbit of Ceres compared to the orbits of Mars and Jupiter.

In the past, Ceres had been considered to be the largest member of an [[asteroid family]].<ref name="Cellino">Cellino, A.; ''et al.''; "Spectroscopic Properties of Asteroid Families", in ''Asteroids III'', pp. 633-643, University of Arizona Press (2002). (Table on page 636, in particular).</ref> These groupings of asteroids share similar orbital elements, which may indicate a common origin through an asteroid collision some time in the past. Ceres, however, was found to have spectral properties different from other members of the family, and so this grouping is now called the [[Gefion family]], named after the lowest-numbered family member, [[1272 Gefion]].<ref name="Cellino" /> Ceres appears to  be merely an interloper in its own family, coincidentally having similar orbital elements but not a common origin.<ref name="Kelley">{{cite journal|author=Kelley, M. S.; Gaffey, M. J.|title=A Genetic Study of the Ceres (Williams #67) Asteroid Family|journal=Bulletin of the American Astronomical Society|year=1996|volume=28|page=1097| url=http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1996BAAS...28R1097K|accessdate=2007-04-27 }}</ref>
The rotational period of Ceres is 9 hours and 4 minutes.<ref name="NSSDC">{{cite journal|author=Williams, David R.|title=Asteroid Fact Sheet|year=2004|url=http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/planetary/factsheet/asteroidfact.html}}</ref>

===Transits of planets from Ceres===
Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars can all appear from Ceres to cross the Sun, or [[astronomical transit|transit]] it. The most common transits are from Mercury, which usually does so every few years, last in 2006 and next in 2010. The similar gaps are from 1953 to 2051 for Venus, 1814 to 2081 for Earth, and for Mars from 767 to 2684.<ref>{{cite web

==Origin and evolution==
The observations imply that Ceres is a surviving [[protoplanet]] (planetary [[Planetary embryo|embryo]]), which formed 4.57 billion years ago in the [[asteroid belt]].<ref name="Petit2001">{{cite journal|last=Petit|first=Jean-Marc|coauthors=Morbidelli, Alessandro|title=The Primordial Excitation and Clearing of the Asteroid Belt|journal=Icarus|volume=153|page=338-347|year=2001| doi=10.1006/icar.2001.6702|url=http://www.gps.caltech.edu/classes/ge133/reading/asteroids.pdf|format=PDF|accessdate=2009-06-25}}</ref> While the majority of [[Solar System #Inner Solar System|inner solar system]] protoplanets (including all lunar- to Mars-sized bodies) either merged with other protoplanets to form [[terrestrial planet]]s or were ejected from the [[Solar System]] by [[Jupiter]],<ref name="Petit2001" /> Ceres survived relatively intact.<ref name="McCord2005" /> (Another possible smaller protoplanet, [[4 Vesta|Vesta]], suffered a catastrophic impact after solidifying.<ref name="Thomas1997" />) However, there is a chance that Ceres formed in the [[Kuiper Belt]] and was later captured by the asteroid belt.<ref>About a 10 % chance of the asteroid belt acquiring a Ceres-mass KBO. William B. McKinnon, 2008, "On The Possibility Of Large KBOs Being Injected Into The Outer Asteroid Belt". ''American Astronomical Society,'' DPS meeting #40, #38.03[http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2008DPS....40.3803M]</ref> 

Further [[Evolution (disambiguation)|evolution]] of Ceres was relatively simple. Heated by the energy of [[accretion (astrophysics)|accretion]] and by decay of various [[radionuclide]]s including, possibly, short-lived elements like [[Isotopes of aluminium|<sup>26</sup>Al]], Ceres differentiated into a rocky [[core (geology)|core]] and icy [[mantle (geology)|mantle]] soon after its formation.<ref name="Li2006" /><ref name="McCord2005" /> This event caused resurfacing by water [[volcanism]] and [[tectonics]], erasing older geological features.<ref name="McCord2005" /> However, due to its small size, Ceres cooled down quickly, and resurfacing processes stopped.<ref name="McCord2005" /><ref name="Castillo-Rogez2007">{{cite journal|last=Castillo-Rogez|first=J. C.|coauthors=McCord, T. B.; and Davis, A. G.|title=Ceres: evolution and present state|journal=Lunar and Planetary Science|volume=XXXVIII|page=2006-2007 |year=2007 |url= http://www.lpi.usra.edu/meetings/lpsc2007/pdf/2006.pdf|format=PDF|accessdate=2009-06-25}}</ref> The ice on the surface gradually [[sublimation (chemistry)|sublimated]], leaving behind various hydrated minerals like [[clay]]s and [[Carbonate minerals|carbonate]]s.<ref name="Rivkin2006" /> Now Ceres is a geologically dead body, whose surface is being sculptured only by [[impact crater|impact]]s.<ref name="Li2006" />

The presence of significant amounts of water ice in its composition<ref name="Thomas2005" /> raises the possibility that Ceres has or had a layer of liquid water in its interior.<ref name="McCord2005" /><ref name="Castillo-Rogez2007" /> This hypothetical layer is often called an [[ocean]].<ref name="Rivkin2006" /> The water layer is (or was) probably located between the rocky core and ice mantle like that of [[Europa (moon)|Europa]].<ref name="McCord2005" /> The existence of an ocean is more likely if [[ammonia]] or other [[antifreeze]] compounds are dissolved in the water.<ref name="McCord2005" /> The possible existence of liquid water inside Ceres makes it a target in the search for [[extraterrestrial life]].<ref name="Moomaw" />

==Observations==
When Ceres has an opposition near the perihelion, it can reach a visual magnitude of +6.7.<ref name="Pasachoff1983">{{cite book|author=Menzel, Donald H.; and Pasachoff, Jay M. |year=1983|title=A Field Guide to the Stars and Planets|edition=2nd edition|publisher=Houghton Mifflin|location=Boston, MA|isbn=0395348358|page=391}}</ref> This is generally regarded as being just barely too dim to be seen with the [[naked eye]], but under exceptional viewing conditions a very sharp-sighted person may be able to see this [[dwarf planet]]. The only other asteroids that can reach a similarly bright magnitude are [[4 Vesta#Visibility|4 Vesta]], and, during rare oppositions near perihelion, [[2 Pallas#Characteristics|2 Pallas]] and [[7 Iris]].<ref>Martinez, Patrick, ''The Observer's Guide to Astronomy'', page 298. Published 1994 by Cambridge University Press</ref> At a [[astronomical conjunction|conjunction]] Ceres has a magnitude of around +9.3, which corresponds to the faintest objects visible with 10<U+00D7>50 [[binoculars]]. It can thus be seen with binoculars whenever it is above the horizon of a fully dark sky.

[[File:Dawn Flight Configuration 2.jpg|thumb|right|Depiction of Dawn firing its [[ion thruster]] en route to Ceres]]

To date, no space probe has visited Ceres. However, [[NASA]] launched the [[Dawn Mission]] on 27 September 2007, which will explore the asteroid [[4 Vesta]] in 2011 before arriving at Ceres in 2015.<ref name="Russel2006" />

The mission profile calls for the Dawn Spacecraft to enter orbit around Ceres at an altitude of 5,900&nbsp;km. The spacecraft will reduce the orbital
