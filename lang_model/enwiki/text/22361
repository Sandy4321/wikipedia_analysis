Six matches were aired on the broadcast and one [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Dark match|dark match]] occurred prior to the live broadcast.

The concept of the event was that the two [[Card (sports)#Main event|main event]] matches, one each for the [[World Heavyweight Championship (WWE)|World Heavyweight Championship]] and the [[WWE Championship]], would occur in an [[Elimination Chamber]]. Each match featured six competitors: the defending champion and five challengers. [[Sheamus]] defended the WWE Championship against [[Triple H]], [[Ted DiBiase, Jr.|Ted DiBiase]], [[Randy Orton]], [[John Cena]], and [[Kofi Kingston]] in the [[WWE Raw|Raw]] Elimination Chamber. In the SmackDown Elimination Chamber match, [[The Undertaker]] defended the World Heavyweight Championship against [[Chris Jericho]], [[John Morrison (wrestler)|John Morrison]], [[Rey Mysterio, Jr.|Rey Mysterio]], [[CM Punk]] and [[Ron Killings|R-Truth]]. On the [[Card (sports)#Undercard|undercard]], [[Drew McIntyre]] defended the [[WWE Intercontinental Championship]] against [[Kane (wrestler)|Kane]], [[Mike Mizanin|The Miz]] defended the [[WWE United States Championship]] against [[Montel Vontavious Porter]], and [[Maryse Ouellet|Maryse]] and [[Gail Kim]] competed against [[LayCool|Team Lay-Cool]] ([[Layla El|Layla]] and [[Michelle McCool]]) in an [[WWE Brand Extension#Interbrand competition|interbrand]] [[WWE Diva|Divas]] [[Professional wrestling tag team match types|tag team match]].

==Production and concept==

[[File:Elimination chamber nyr06.jpg|thumb|The Elimination Chamber [[pay-per-view]] featured two [[Elimination Chamber]] matches.]]
In late 2009, [[World Wrestling Entertainment]] (WWE) held a poll on their official website to allow fans to choose a name for their February [[pay-per-view]]. The choices included Elimination Chamber, Heavy Metal, Battle Chamber, Chamber of Conflict and No Way Out, which had been the name of the [[WWE No Way Out|preceeding Elimination Chamber-based event]].<ref name="poll">{{cite web|url=http://www.wrestleview.com/news2009/1253816146.php|title=WWE to rename No Way Out PPV?|date=September 24, 2009|first=Adam|last=Martin|accessdate=December 20, 2009|publisher=WrestleView}}</ref> The name Elimination Chamber won, and the event was renamed.<ref name="EC-Rules">{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/eliminationchamber/history/2010/exclusives/chamberrules|title=Elimination Chamber Match rules|accessdate=February 2, 2010|publisher=[[World Wrestling Entertainment]]}}</ref> Despite this, the event was still promoted as No Way Out in [[Germany]].<ref name="Germany"/><ref name="Ger"/>

The concept of the show was that each [[Card (sports)#Main event|main event match]] was to be contested as an [[Elimination Chamber]] match.<ref name="EC-Rules"/> The Elimination Chamber is a circular steel cage, consisting of [[chain]]s and [[girder]]s, that surrounds the ring. Four 'pods' are enclosed within the chamber, one behind each ring post, which are on a steel platform surrounding the outside of the ring. Six wrestlers compete in the match; four are enclosed within the pods and released at random at specific time intervals, and two start the match.<ref name="EC-Rules"/> Wrestlers can only be eliminated via [[Pin (professional wrestling)|pinfall]] and [[Professional wrestling#Submission|submission]], and the last wrestler left is the winner.<ref name="EC-Rules"/> For the Elimination Chamber pay-per-view, both of WWE [[World Heavyweight Championship (professional wrestling)|world championships]], the [[WWE Championship]] and the [[World Heavyweight Championship (WWE)|World Heavyweight Championship]], were to be defended in separate Elimination Chamber matches.<ref name="EC-Rules"/>

Just prior to the commencement of the [[World Heavyweight Championship (WWE)|World Heavyweight Championship]] Elimination Chamber match, [[The Undertaker]] was involved in a [[pyrotechnics]] accident during his ring entrance. He was temporarily engulfed in flames when the pyrotechnics were mistimed, and his jacket caught on fire. It was later reported that he'd suffered [[Burn#By degree|first- and second-degree burns]] to his neck and chest, and according to a WWE spokesperson the injury "looked like a bad sunburn". He was only allowed to participate in the match after being cleared by a ringside doctor and was given bottles of water throughout the match to douse himself with to attempt to alleviate the discomfort.<ref name="burns">{{cite web|url=http://www.fanhouse.com/2010/02/22/the-undertaker-burned-during-accident-at-elimination-chamber/|title=The Undertaker Burned During Accident at Elimination Chamber|date=February 22, 2010|last=Fritz|first=Brian|accessdate=July 21, 2010|publisher=AOL Fanhouse}}</ref>

Prior to the live broadcast of the pay-per-view, [[Christian (wrestler)|Christian]] defeated [[Ezekiel Jackson]] in a [[Professional wrestling match types#Variations of singles matches|singles match]] by [[Pin (professional wrestling)|pinfall]].<ref name=Dark/>

===Preliminary matches===
[[File:LoLA.jpg|thumb|[[Sheamus]] lost the [[WWE Championship]] to [[John Cena]] in an [[Elimination Chamber]] match.]]
The first match that aired on the pay-per-view was the Raw Elimination Chamber match, which involved Randy Orton, Triple H, Ted DiBiase, Kofi Kingston, John Cena, and the defending WWE Champion Sheamus. Sheamus and Kingston started the match, while the other four competitors were locked inside [[Elimination Chamber#Match rules|'pods']]. One pod at a time opened during the match at intervals of five minutes, releasing a wrestler into the match. Triple H was the first wrestler released, followed by Randy Orton, Ted DiBiase, and finally Cena. After Cena entered the match, Cody Rhodes, an ally of both DiBiase and Orton went to ringside, and threw a steel pipe into the cage. DiBiase used the pipe to hit both Orton and Cena, and then covered Orton to eliminate him from the match after approximately 24 minutes. Kingston used his [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Finisher|finishing move]], "Trouble in Paradise" (a [[540 kick]]) to eliminate DIBiase after 25-and-a-half minutes. Immediately afterward, Sheamus eliminated Kingston by pinfall, before being eliminated himself by Triple H at approximately 29 minutes, leaving only Cena and Triple H in the match. Cena used a [[Professional wrestling holds|submission hold]], the [[Professional wrestling holds#STF|STF]] on Triple H to eliminate him from the match via [[Professional wrestling#Submission|submission]].<ref name="slam"/><ref name="PWT"/> As a result, Cena won the WWE Championship for the sixth time, his eight [[World Heavyweight Championship (professional wrestling)|world championship]] overall.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/inside/titlehistory/wwechampionship/201002211|title=History of the WWE Championship: John Cena (6)|date=February 21, 2010|accessdate=July 21, 2010|publisher=[[World Wrestling Entertainment]]}}</ref>

Immediately following the conclusion of the match, WWE Chairman [[Vince McMahon]] interrupted to [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Promo|cut a promo]]. He told Cena that he would be going to [[WrestleMania XXVI]], only if he could beat [[Dave Batista|Batista]], and then ordered Cena to face Batista in a previously unannounced match for the WWE Championship. Batista [[Professional wrestling attacks#Spear|speared]] Cena, and then performed a "Batista Bomb" (a [[Powerbomb#Sitout powerbomb|sitout powerbomb]]) on him to earn a pinfall victory, making Batista the new WWE Champion.<ref name="slam"/><ref name="PWT"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/inside/titlehistory/wwechampionship/20100221|title=History of the WWE Championship: Batista (2)|date=February 21, 2010|accessdate=July 21, 2010|publisher=[[World Wrestling Entertainment]]}}</ref>

The third match featured Drew McIntyre defending the WWE Intercontinental Championship against [[Kane (wrestler)|Kane]]. The match began with Kane taking the advantage over McIntyre by [[Professional wrestling attacks#Clothesline|clotheslining]] him over the top rope to the floor. Towards the end of the match, McIntyre attempted to leave the arena and lose via countout, which would have allowed him to retain the championship, but Kane brought him back inside the ring. When re-entering the ring, McIntyre poked him in the eye and then performed his "Future Shock DDT" (a [[DDT (professional wrestling)#Double underhook DDT|double underhook DDT]]) to win the match by pinfall and remain the Intercontinental Champion.<ref name="slam"/><ref name="PWT"/>

The next match was scheduled to be the final of a tournament to determine a new Divas Champion after the championship was vacated. Maryse and Gail Kim had entered the ring when [[Professional wrestling authority figures#Miscellaneous authority figures|official consultant]] to the [[Professional wrestling authority figures#General Managers 2|SmackDown General Manager]], [[Vickie Guerrero]] interrupted. Guerrero stated that a result of the Raw [[WWE Diva|Divas]] making disparaging remarks about the SmackDown Divas, she was changing the match to an [[WWE Brand Extension#Interbrand competition|interbrand]] Divas [[Professional wrestling tag team match types|tag team match]], with Raw Divas Kim and Maryse facing [[LayCool|Team Lay-Cool]] ([[Michelle McCool]] and [[Layla El|Layla]]) from SmackDown. The story of the match was that Maryse and Kim could not work together, and Maryse attacked Kim, allowing McCool to hit her finishing move for the victory. Following the match, Maryse performed her "French Kiss DDT" on Kim.<ref name="slam"/><ref name="PWT"/> Following the match, [[Mike Mizanin|The Miz]] was interviewed backstage by [[Josh Mathews]] about ''[[WWE NXT|NXT]]'', on which he was a mentor. He was interrupted by [[Montel Vontavious Porter]], who informed The Miz that the two had a match next.<ref name="slam"/><ref name="PWT"/> This was followed by [[William Regal]] cutting an in-ring promo on ''NXT''. He was interrupted by the winner of the [[Royal Rumble (2010)|2010]] [[Royal Rumble#Match|Royal Rumble match]], Edge, who stated that he would be deciding which championship to challenge for at WrestleMania on the next episode of ''Raw''. Edge then speared Regal.<ref name="slam"/><ref name="PWT"/>

The fifth match was a previously unannounced contest which saw The Miz defend his [[WWE United States Championship]] against Montel Vontavious Porter. The Miz was accompanied by his tag team partner, [[Paul Wight|The Big Show]], while Porter was accompanied by [[Mark Henry]], with whom he had regularly teamed. Porter took the advantage at the beginning of the match, before The Miz was able to fight back with a [[DDT (professional wrestling)#Swinging DDT|swinging DDT]]. When he climbed to the top rope, however, Porter knocked him off to regain the advantage. The Big Show pulled The Miz out of the ring to safety, and then threw Mark Henry into the security barricade at ringside. With the [[Referee (professional wrestling)|referee]] distracted by this, The Big Show used his "Knockout Punch" on Porter, and The Miz was able to pin him to retain his championship.<ref name="slam"/><ref name="PWT"/>

The [[Card (sports)#Main event|main event]] of the pay-per-view was the SmackDown Elimination Chamber match for the World Heavyweight Championship, featuring the defending champion The Undertaker, CM Punk, Rey Mysterio, Chris Jericho, John Morrison, and R-Truth. Mysterio, Morrison, and Jericho entered first and were locked into pods.<ref name="slam"/><ref name="PWT"/> The Undertaker was the fourth to make his way down to the ring, but an accident occurred during his match when his pyrotechnics were mistimed, resulting in him being momentarily engulfed in flames. He was cleared by a ringside doctor to wrestle, however, and was able to compete in the match.<ref name="burns"/> The final two, who were to start the match, were CM Punk, who was accompanied by his [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Stable|stable]], The Straight-Edge Society of [[Serena Deeb|Serena]] and [[Drew Hankinson|Luke Gallows]], and R-Truth. Punk cut a promo on his way to the ring, but was interrupted by R-Truth's entrance. Punk was able to eliminate R-Truth in about three-and-a-half minutes, before any other competitor had entered the match, and was able to finish his promo afterward. Mysterio entered after the first five minutes had passed, and eliminated Punk before the next competitor entered. The next entrant was revealed to be Jericho, and he and Mysterio wrestled for five minutes until Morrison was released. Morrison utilised his "Starship Pain" finisher (a [[Moonsault#Split-legged moonsault|split-legged]] [[Moonsault#Corkscrew moonsault|corkscrew moonsault]]) to pin Mysterio and eliminate him from the match. The final entrant into the match was the defending champion The Undertaker, who was able to eliminate Morrison following a [[chokeslam]] after approximately 28 minutes. [[Shawn Michaels]], who had requested and been denied a match with The Undertaker for WrestleMania, snuck into the chamber, and performed his "Sweet Chin Music" [[Professional wrestling attacks#Superkick|superkick]] on The Undertaker. This allowed Jericho to pin The Undertaker to win the match and the World Heavyweight Championship for the third time.<ref name="slam"/><ref name="PWT"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/inside/titlehistory/worldheavyweight/20100221|title=History of the World Heavyweight Championship: Chris Jericho (3)|date=February 21, 2010|accessdate=July 21, 2010|publisher=[[World Wrestling Entertainment]]}}</ref>
