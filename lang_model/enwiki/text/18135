'''Windows Mobile''' is a compact [[operating system]] combined with a suite of basic applications for [[mobile device]]s based on the [[Microsoft]] [[Windows API|Win32]] [[application programming interface|API]]. Devices that run Windows Mobile include [[Pocket PC]]s, [[Smartphone]]s, [[Portable Media Center]]s, and on-board computers for certain [[automobile]]s. It is designed to be somewhat similar to [[desktop environment|desktop]] versions of [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]], feature-wise and aesthetically. Additionally, third-party [[software development]] is available for Windows Mobile. Originally appearing as the '''Pocket PC 2000''' operating system, Windows Mobile has been updated several times, with the current version being Windows Mobile 6.1, and a new release scheduled for 2010.<ref name="Photon">{{cite web|url=http://www.reghardware.co.uk/2006/10/10/windows_mobile_6_screens_leak/|title=Vista-inspired Windows Mobile 6 spied on web|date=[[October 10]], [[2006]]|first=Tony|last=Smith|publisher=The Register Hardware}}</ref> 

Microsoft projected in 2008 that shipments of devices with Windows Mobile will increase from 11 million to 20 million units, but it missed its initial goal in only selling 18 million licenses citing the delayed launch of certain smartphones. Windows Mobile has a worldwide smartphone market share of 13%<ref>[http://seattlepi.nwsource.com/business/372906_msftmobile31.html]</ref>. Microsoft licenses Windows Mobile to four out of the five world's largest mobile phone manufacturers, with Nokia being the other.<ref>[http://mytreo.net/archives/2008/02/sony-ericsson-makes-major-move-in-palms-footsteps-wise-decision.html#more "Sony Ericsson makes major move"]</ref>

[[Image:Portable Media Center.jpg|thumb|A Portable Media Center]]

===Pocket PC===
{{Main|Pocket PC}}
The [[Pocket PC]] was the original intended platform for the Windows Mobile operating system.  These devices consisted of both standalone Pocket PC devices without [[mobile phone]] capabilities, and those that included mobile phone capabilities.  The most current name of Windows Mobile intended for use on Pocket PCs is officially "Windows Mobile 6 Professional" for devices with mobile phone capabilities and "Windows Mobile 6 Classic" for devices without mobile phone capabilities.

===Smartphone===
{{Main|Smartphone}}
The [[Smartphone]] became the next hardware platform after the Pocket PC to run Windows Mobile, and debuted with the release of Pocket PC 2002.  Although in the broad sense of the term "Smartphone", both Pocket PC phones and Microsoft branded Smartphones each fit into this category, it should be noted that Microsoft's use of the term "Smartphone" includes only more specific hardware devices that differ from Pocket PC phones.  Such Smartphones were originally designed without [[touchscreen]]s, intended to be operated more efficiently with only one hand, and typically had lower resolution displays than Pocket PCs.  Microsoft's focus for the Smartphone platform was to create a device that functioned well as a phone and data device in a more integrated manner.<ref>[http://web.archive.org/web/20020608124628/www.microsoft.com/mobile/phones/smartphone/integrated.asp Mobile Phones|Smartphone - Software Features Overview]. Microsoft. Retrieved 6 September 2007 from the [[Internet Archive]].</ref>  The current name of Windows Mobile intended for use on Smartphones is officially "Windows Mobile 6 Standard".

===Portable Media Center===
{{Main|Portable Media Center}}
The [[Portable Media Center]] was a device that focused on integration with Microsoft's [[Windows Media Center]] and [[Windows Media Player]] to allow users to carry their media libraries with them on the go.  The Portable Media Center was officially introduced in 2004, and ran a modified version of Windows Mobile.  These devices became the predecessor to Microsoft's [[Zune]], and after 2006 Microsoft discontinued the project in favor of the latter.

===Automobiles===
"Windows Mobile for Automotive" is the name for Microsoft's operating system that facilitates multiple functions in [[automobile]]s including communication, entertainment, information systems.<ref name="Automotive">[http://www.microsoft.com/windowsautomotive/wma/default.mspx Windows Mobile for Automotive 1.0]. Microsoft. Retrieved 6 September 2007.</ref>  Windows Mobile for use in automobiles is the latest platform  for the operating system, and was introduced by Microsoft in February of 2006 at the Geneva International Motor Show.<ref>[http://www.geekzone.co.nz/content.asp?contentid=5962 "Microsoft Windows Mobile for Automotive Launches with Fiat System"]. ''Geekzone'' ([[March 4|4 March]] [[2006]]). SohoSolutions. Retrieved [[September 6|6 September]] [[2007]].</ref>  Windows Mobile for Automotive comes in two different versions.  The Basic version includes a [[Bluetooth]] connectivity and [[Universal Serial Bus|USB]] interface for music playback.  The Standard version includes this also, but additionally it features a built-in [[Global Positioning System|GPS]], [[GSM]] phone, and security features.  These systems are more widely known as SYNC. The Windows Mobile for Automotive hardware specification includes a 300 MHz [[ARM architecture|ARM]] processor, 32 MB of RAM, and a microphone.<ref name="Automotive" />

==Versions==
===Pocket PC 2000===
[[Image:Pocket PC 2000.jpg|thumb|160px|Typical Pocket PC 2000 Today Screen.]]
Pocket PC 2000, originally codenamed "Rapier",<ref name="Codenames">De Herrera, Chris. [http://www.pocketpcfaq.com/wce/versions.htm ''Windows CE/Windows Mobile Versions'']. pocketpcfaq.com. Retrieved 6 September 2007.</ref> was released in April of 2000, and was based on [[Windows CE]] 3.0.  It was the debut of what was later dubbed the Windows Mobile operating system, and meant to be a successor to the operating system aboard [[Palm-size PC|Palm-Size PCs]].  Backwards compatibility was retained with such Palm-Size PC applications.    Pocket PC 2000 was intended mainly for [[Pocket PC]] devices, however several Palm-Size PC devices had the ability to be updated as well.  In addition, several Pocket PC 2000 phones were released, however the [[Smartphone]] hardware platform was not yet created.  The only resolution supported by this release was 240 x 320 ([[QVGA]]).  Removable storage card formats that were supported were [[CompactFlash]] and [[MultiMediaCard]].  At this time Pocket PC devices had not been standardized with a specific CPU architecture.  As a result, Pocket PC 2000 was released on multiple CPU architectures; [[SuperH|SH-3]], [[MIPS architecture|MIPS]], and [[ARM architecture|ARM]].

Aesthetically, the original Pocket PC operating system was similar to [[Windows 98]], [[Windows Me]], and [[Windows 2000]] operating systems.

Features/built-in applications for Pocket PC 2000 included the following:<ref>De Herrera, Chris. [http://www.pocketpcmag.com/_archives/may00/MorethanPDA.asp ''More Than a PDA!'']. Pocket PC Magazine. Retrieved 14 September 2007.</ref>

Pocket PC 2002, originally codenamed "Merlin",<ref name="Codenames" /> was released in October 2001.  Like Pocket PC 2000, it was powered by [[Windows CE]] 3.0.  Although targeted mainly for 240 <U+00D7> 320 ([[QVGA]]) [[Pocket PC]] devices, Pocket PC 2002 was also used for Pocket PC phones, and for the first time, [[Smartphone]]s.<ref>Morris, John; Taylor, Josh, [http://web.archive.org/web/20011217080411/www.zdnet.com/products/stories/reviews/0,4161,2824082,00.html ''Microsoft jumps in the all-in-one game''], zdnet.com, Retrieved from the [[Internet Archive]] 6 September 2007.</ref>  These Pocket PC 2002 Smartphones were mainly [[GSM]] devices.  With future releases, the Pocket PC and Smartphone lines would increasingly collide as the licensing terms were relaxed allowing OEMs to take advantage of more innovative, individual design ideas.  Aesthetically, Pocket PC 2002 was meant to be similar in design to the then newly released [[Windows XP]].

==Software development==
Third-party [[software development]] is available for the Windows Mobile operating system.  There are several options for developers to use when deploying a mobile application.  This includes writing native code with [[Visual C++]], writing [[Managed code]] that works with the [[.NET Compact Framework]], or [[Server-side scripting|Server-side code]] that can be deployed using [[Internet Explorer Mobile]] or a mobile client on the user's device.  The .NET Compact Framework is actually a subset of the [[.NET Framework]] and hence shares many components with software development on desktop clients, application servers, and web servers which have the .NET Framework installed, thus integrating networked computing space (a.k.a. "The Cloud")<ref>[http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/2weec7k5.aspx Differences Between the .NET Compact Framework and the .NET Framework]</ref>.

Microsoft typically releases Windows Mobile [[Software development kit]]s (SDKs) that work in conjunction with their [[Microsoft Visual Studio|Visual Studio]] development environment.  These SDKs include [[emulator]] images for developers to test and [[Debugging|debug]] their applications while writing them.  Microsoft also distributes Visual Studio 2008 / 2005 Professional Editions, and server / database counterparts to students as downloads free of charge via its [[DreamSpark]] program<ref>[http://www.microsoft.com/Presspass/press/2008/feb08/02-18GSDPR.mspx Microsoft Gives Students Access to Technical Software at No Charge to Inspire Success and Make a Difference]</ref>.  In addition language-specific versions (Visual Basic, C++, C#, Web) of Visual Studio Express and database counterparts are freely available to anyone via the Microsoft site<ref>[http://www.microsoft.com/express/download/ Visual Studio Express and SQL Server Express download site]</ref>.

Prior to the release of Windows Mobile 2003, third-party software was developed using Microsoft's eMbedded Visual Tools.<ref>[http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/windowsmobile/bb264342.aspx Learn Windows Mobile: Overview]. Microsoft. Retrieved 5 October 2007.</ref>
