==Description and history==
Redwood is set at the southeastern end of Barberry Lane, south of the main village of Bar Harbor, on a point north of Cromwell Cove that overlooks [[Frenchman Bay]].  It is a large 2-1/2 story wood frame structure with a roughly cruciform plan, set on a fieldstone foundation.  It has a long north-south axis with roughly centered projections to the east (facing the water) and the west (facing toward the street).  The western projection is gabled-roofed, with a second-floor chamber set above a porte-cochere which shelters the main entrance.  To its right a tall two-story window rises to a small gabled peak, with an elaborately-decorated brick Queen Anne style chimney to its right.  The eastern projection has a polygonal shape, with a semi-pyramidal roofline.  The southern elevation has a recessed Palladian window set in a half-timbered upper section.  An enclosed single-story polygonal porch projects from the southeast corner of the building.  The interior of the house is richly decorated with woodwork.<ref name=NRHP>{{cite web|url=http://pdfhost.focus.nps.gov/docs/NRHP/Text/78000166.pdf|title=NRHP nomination for Redwood|publisher=National Park Service|accessdate=2015-03-25}}</ref>

Bar Harbor began to develop a reputation as a summer resort area in the 1860s, with its early tourist trade served by local residents boarding visitors in their houses, and by hotels that were built to meet the demand.  In the 1870s wealthy visitors began building private houses.  C. J. Morrill, a wealthy Bostonian, commissioned [[William Ralph Emerson]] to design this house, which was completed in 1879.  This was the first (of many) residential commission Emerson executed in the Bar Harbor area, and was his first full expression of the Shingle style,<ref name=NRHP/> whose oldest known example is the 1875 [[William Watts House]] in [[Newport, Rhode Island]], designed by [[H. H. Richardson]].
