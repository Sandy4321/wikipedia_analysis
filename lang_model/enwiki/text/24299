The '''Amos Tuck School of Business Administration''' (or the '''Tuck School of Business at Dartmouth''', as it is now called) is the [[Graduate school|graduate]] [[business school]] of [[Dartmouth College]] in [[Hanover, New Hampshire]], in the [[United States]]. Founded in 1900, Tuck is the oldest graduate school of business in the world, and was the first institution to offer [[master's degree]]s in the field of [[administration (business)|business administration]].<ref>{{cite web | url = http://alumni.yale.edu/clubs/fapn/2001_04_09_WSJ.html | title = And the Winner Is...

Tuck grants only one degree, the [[Master of Business Administration]] (MBA), alongside shorter programs for executives and recent college graduates, although there are opportunities for dual degrees with other institutions. The school places a heavy emphasis on its tight-knit and residential character, and has a student population that hovers near 500 students and a full-time faculty of 46.<ref name="about tuck">{{cite web | url = http://www.tuck.edu/about/index.html | title = About Tuck | publisher = Tuck School of Business | accessdate = 2007-11-09 }}</ref> Tuck claims over 8,400 living [[alumni]] in a variety of fields, with the highest rate of alumni donation of any business school.

== History ==
[[Image:Amos tuck.jpg|thumb|right|[[Amos Tuck]], the namesake of the Tuck School]]
At the turn of the 20th century, Dartmouth College president [[William Jewett Tucker]] decided to explore the possibility of establishing a school of business to educate the growing number of Dartmouth alumni entering the commercial world.<ref name="jstor">{{cite web | url =http://www.jstor.org/stable/1979681| title = The Amos Tuck School of Business Administration: Its Origin and Present Program | first = Karl A. | last = Hill | month = December | year = 1961 | work = Journal of Higher Education | vol=32|issue=9|pages=473<U+2013>479 | accessdate = 2007-11-08}}</ref> Turning to his former roommate from his undergraduate years at Dartmouth, Tucker enlisted the support of [[Edward Tuck]], who had since become a wealthy banker and philanthropist.<ref name="our history">{{cite web | url = http://www.tuck.edu/about/history/index.html | title = About Tuck: Our History | publisher = Tuck School of Business | accessdate = 2007-11-08 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070524141711/http://www.tuck.edu/about/history/index.html <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2007-05-24}}</ref> Tuck donated $300,000 in the form of [[preferred stock]] shares in a Minnesota railroad company as the capital to found the school. It was named the Amos Tuck School of Administration and Finance, after Edward Tuck's father and Dartmouth alumnus [[Amos Tuck]].<ref name="our history"/>

The new school's annual tuition was $100 for the few students who enrolled in the first year; graduates of the two-year program received a Master of Commercial Science degree (MCS).<ref name="tuck history timeline"/><ref name="our history"/> The curriculum involved both traditional [[liberal arts]] fields as well as economic and finance education.<ref name="jstor"/> Undergraduate professors taught most of the first-year courses, while outside guest instructors and businesspeople educated students in their second years.<ref name="jstor"/><ref name="our history"/> As the nation's first graduate school of business, the Tuck School's emphasis on a broad education in general management was adopted by many other emerging business schools, and was dubbed the "Tuck Pattern".<ref name="jstor"/><ref name="our history"/>

In the late 1920s, Dartmouth president [[Ernest Martin Hopkins]] sought to unify the Tuck School by establishing a central campus, uniting the school's academic and residential facilities. Edward Tuck, then an aged man living in France, donated an additional $570,000 for the effort.<ref name="our history"/> Using primarily his funds, four new buildings were constructed in 1929 on the west side of Dartmouth's campus.<ref name="our history"/><ref name="dartmo-tuck">{{cite web | url = http://www.dartmo.com/buildings/tuvwxyzbldg.html#tuckhall2 | title = Tuck Hall (II) | work = Dartmo.: The Buildings of Dartmouth College | accessdate = 2007-10-02 }}</ref>

In 1942, the school's name changed to the Amos Tuck School of Business Administration, and in 1953, the degree program changed to the modern [[Master of Business Administration]] (MBA). Until the late 1950s and early 1960s, the Tuck School catered primarily to Dartmouth students, accepting undergraduates during their third year.<ref name="our history"/> Under Dean Karl Hill (1957<U+2013>1960), Tuck shifted its focus to soliciting a national student body. The resulting expansion under [http://JHennessey.org Dean John Hennessey] (1968<U+2013>1976) in the late 1960s saw additional growth of the campus with the construction of a new dormitory (1969) and the Murdough Center (1973), which contains the Feldberg Business and Engineering Library. Under Deans Richard West (1976<U+2013>1983) and Colin Blaydon (1983<U+2013>1990), the school's curriculum and faculty expanded extensively, and applications increased by one-third.<ref name="our history"/> Since the late 1980s, Tuck has continued to expand in student body and faculty size, and has seen the establishment of two new campus buildings as well as several research centers and nondegree business programs.<ref name="tuck history timeline"/>

The school stresses a collaborative and teamwork-based approach to learning, which it touts as one of its assets for "building the interpersonal skills required for business leadership."<ref name="strategy"/> However, this emphasis on cooperative group learning has been criticized as too "touchy-feely" for students entering the competitive business world, and the emphasis on consensus-building as detrimental to students' ability to make quick, independent decisions.<ref name="tuckies"/> The school's academic programs have also been criticized for not offering their students a broader international perspective, though the school has sought to remedy this by offering globally oriented courses, programs, and research.<ref name="tuckies"/><ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.careerjournal.com/reports/bschool05/snapshot/dartmouth.html | title = Dartmouth College (Tuck) | publisher = CareerJournal.com: The Wall Street Journal Executive Career Site | year = 2005 | accessdate = 2007-11-11 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.tuck.edu/mba/global/index.html | title = The Tuck MBA: Global View | publisher = Tuck School of Business | accessdate = 2007-11-11 }}</ref>

Like the undergraduate portion of Dartmouth College, the Tuck School operates on a [[Academic term|quarter system]].<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.tuck.dartmouth.edu/mba/academic_calendar.html | title = Academic Calendar | publisher = Tuck School of Business | accessdate = 2007-11-06 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071031074253/http://www.tuck.dartmouth.edu/mba/academic_calendar.html <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2007-10-31}}</ref> As part of the larger institution, the Tuck School is ultimately administered by Dartmouth's President and [[Board of Trustees of Dartmouth College|Board of Trustees]]. The school is directly managed by a Dean (currently Paul Danos) who is advised by a Board of Overseers that was established in 1951.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.tuck.dartmouth.edu/about/staff/overseers.html | title = Board of Overseers | publisher = Tuck School of Business | accessdate = 2007-11-06 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071105071427/http://www.tuck.dartmouth.edu/about/staff/overseers.html <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2007-11-05}}</ref>

Since the Tuck School offers only one degree, it does not contain formal academic departments as do other institutions. Instead, faculty are generally grouped in one or more of seven "academic areas": [[accounting]], [[finance]] and [[economics]], [[marketing]], [[operations management]] and [[management science]], strategy and management, [[international business]], and management communication.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.tuck.dartmouth.edu/faculty/academic_areas.html | title = Academic Areas | publisher = Tuck School of Business | accessdate = 2007-11-06 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071103085344/http://www.tuck.dartmouth.edu/faculty/academic_areas.html <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2007-11-03}}</ref> Tuck is also home to five research centers which organize research in different fields of business administration. The centers are meant to promote faculty research, establish liaisons between the Tuck School and the corporate world, and sponsor programs for Tuck as a whole; MBA students are occasionally invited to participate as fellows and research associates.<ref name="tuck-rc">{{cite web | url = http://www.tuck.dartmouth.edu/faculty/research_centers.html | title = Research Centers | publisher = Tuck School of Business | accessdate = 2007-11-06 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071101050952/http://www.tuck.dartmouth.edu/faculty/research_centers.html <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2007-11-01}}</ref> The five research centers are the William F.
