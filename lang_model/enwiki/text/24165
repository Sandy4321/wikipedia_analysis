"'''S&M'''" is a song by [[Barbados|Barbadian]] recording artist [[Rihanna]] from her fifth studio album, ''[[Loud (Rihanna album)|Loud]]'' (2010). The song was released as the album's fourth overall single in the United States and third international single on January 21, 2011. Production of the song was done by [[Stargate (production team)|Stargate]] and [[Sandy Vee]]. At a first retrospective, the lyrics of the song suggest it to be about Rihanna declaring her sexual pleasure, however the underlying message is of her relationship with the media. Musically "S&M" is a [[dance-pop]] song, and incorporates elements of [[Eurodance]] and [[electro music|electro]]. Reception of "S&M" has been mixed, with some reviewers criticizing the overt use of sexual lyrics, while others noting it as a stand-out track from ''Loud''. In April 2011, the song was re-released as a remix single to digital outlets, with guest vocals by American recording artist [[Britney Spears]]. The collaboration with Spears happened due to her love for the song.

"S&M" debuted at number fifty-three on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] upon the album's release and peaked at number two. With the release of the remix featuring Spears, digital sales pushed the song to the top of the chart for one week, giving Rihanna her tenth number one single on the chart and Spears her fifth. The song also reached number one in Australia, Canada and Poland, as well as peaking at number one on the [[UK R&B Chart|UK R&B Singles Chart]] and the ''Billboard'' [[Hot Dance Club Songs]] and [[Mainstream Top 40 (Pop Songs)|Pop Songs]] charts. The song attained top-five positions on the German, French, British, Irish and Spanish charts.

The song's accompanying music video was directed by [[Melina Matsoukas]] and presents Rihanna's opinions of the media, by punishing the ones who have written negatively about her or personally hurt her, while portraying sadomasochist related scenes and [[sexual fetishism|fetishes]]. It was banned in several countries, while being restricted to nighttime TV-only in others, due to the explicit content of the video. In the United Kingdom, "S&M" was deemed too explicit for daytime airplay and was re-edited, with all references to "sex", "chains" or "whips" removed. It was re-named "Come On" for [[BBC Radio 1|BBC radio stations]], however other stations played the original version. Photographer [[David LaChapelle]] brought a plagiarism case against the creators of the video, alleging that it uses imagery from his photo shoot for ''[[Vogue Italia]]''.

Rihanna performed the song for the first time at the [[2011 BRIT Awards]] at London's [[The O2 Arena (London)|O<sub>2</sub> Arena]] on February 15, 2011, as a part of a medley with "[[Only Girl (In the World)]]" and "[[What's My Name? (Rihanna song)|What's My Name?]]". Other performances were at [[NBC]]'s ''[[Today (NBC program)|Today]]'' show, as apart of the "Summer Concert Series", and also on her [[Last Girl on Earth Tour|Last Girl on Earth]] and [[Loud Tour|Loud]] tours. All the performances incorporated the sadomasochism inspired imagery from the music video.

With regard to the lyrical content, Rihanna explained in an interview with ''[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]'' that people should not take the lyrics too literally. "I don't think of it in a sexual way, I'm thinking metaphorically ... it's more of a thing to say that people can talk ... people are going to talk about you, you can't stop that. You just have to be that strong person and know who you are so that stuff just bounces off.

<blockquote>
"At first, we didn't know what the song was going to do because of the lyrics, but it became really big on radio and it's #1 at Pop this week. In order to do a remix, it had to be major... I asked my fans last week who they wanted me to collaborate with, and Britney was one of the most popular names. It's very strange: Britney never does features. It was really amazing that she really wanted to be part of this song. She really liked the song to begin with, but it was a different story when she had to sing it, and she really wanted to be a part of it. It made it really special, because you never see two pop female artists doing songs together anymore. Just call us 'R&B.'"<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1661717/britney-spears-rihanna.jhtml|title=Rihanna Says Britney Spears' 'S&M' Remix 'Had To Be Major'|last=Vena|first=Jocelyn|date=2011-04-09|accessdate=2011-06-17|publisher=MTV (MTV Networks)}}</ref>

==Critical reception==
S&M received mixed reviews from music critics. Sal Cinquemani of [[Slant Magazine]] and Thomas Conner of ''[[Chicago Sun Times]]'' noted that "S&M" was one song from ''Loud'' that was reminiscent of the darker themes present in Rihanna's previous album, ''[[Rated R (Rihanna album)|Rated R]]'' (2009).<ref name="Sun Times">{{cite news|last=Conner |first=Thomas |url=http://www.suntimes.com/entertainment/2896510,conner-rhianna-loud-review-111610.article |title='Loud' a well-deserved party for Rihanna |work=[[Chicago Sun-Times]] |publisher=Sun-Times Media, LLC. |date=2010-11-19 |accessdate=2011-01-29}}</ref><ref name="Cinquenmani">{{cite news|last=Cinquemani |first=Sal |url=http://www.slantmagazine.com/music/review/rihanna-loud/2312 |title=Rihanna: Loud &#124; Music Review |publisher=[[Slant Magazine]] |date=2010-11-12 |accessdate=2011-01-29}}</ref> Cinquenmani went on to describe "S&M" as an ode to [[sadomasochism]], "that would make various parts of [[Janet Jackson|Janet]] [Jackson's] body perk up".<ref name="Cinquenmani"/> Andy Kellman of [[Allmusic]] praised "S&M" as one of the better [[dance-pop]] songs from ''Loud'', for efficiently balancing "Rihanna<U+2019>s playful and sinister sides", though he noticed that it was not as good as her previous single "[[Rude Boy (song)|Rude Boy]]" (2010).<ref name="Allmusic"/> Leah Greenblatt of ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]''  called the song a "late-night-[[Cinemax]] naughtiness", adding that it's an "explicitly carnal opener".<ref>{{cite news|last=Greenblatt |first=Leah |url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20440920,00.html |title=Loud &#124; Music |work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|publisher=Time Inc |date=2010-11-10 |accessdate=2011-01-29}}</ref> Jake Conway of  ''[[Q (magazine)|Q]]'' stated that "In her frosty chant, 'Cause I may be bad, but I'm perfectly good at it / Sex in the air, I don't care, I love the smell of it' on her latest track, 'S&M', Rihanna proves why she remains one of the most provocative artists in pop music. Precisely by divesting sex of emotion and re-imagining violence as fetish ("sticks and stone may break my bones / but chains and whips excite me<U+201D>), Rihanna turns the tables on abusive ex-lover [[Chris Brown (entertainer)|Chris Brown]] in this heady dance club tribute to bondage <U+2014> empowered, and as terrifyingly sexy as ever".<ref>{{cite news|title=Review: S&M|date=2011-04-21|accessdate=2011-06-12|work=[[Q (magazine)|Q]]|publisher=Time Warner|url=http://www.qmagazineatyale.com/culture/music/rihanna-<U+201C>sm<U+201D>/|last=Conway|first=Jake}}</ref> Nick Levine of ''[[Digital Spy]]'' gave the song four out of five stars, saying that, "Icky slip-up aside, this club pop thumper gets you just as up-for-it as the Mail-baiting Bajan herself."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/music/singlesreviews/a302069/rihanna-sm.html|title=Rihanna: 'S&M'|date=March 20, 2011|accessdate=March 20, 2011|publisher=Digital Spy|last=Levine|first=Nick}}</ref> Meg Sullivan of ''The Music Magazine'' gave a mixed review, stating that "Admittedly it is a catchy tune, and doesn<U+2019>t take much to remember the lyrics, as 50% of them are "oh na-na-na-na, come on," a classic sign of "I had nothing else decent to write".

However, the song also met with negative reviews. James Skinner of [[BBC Music]] felt that the song lost some of the appeal that some of ''Rated R''{{'}}s "chart-friendly moments" had. Skinner criticized the use of "sadomasochistic" lyrics which he said were not synonymous with the "flirtatious" appeal that Rihanna was trying to create. He said: "as bracingly huge and catchy as it is, "S&M" doesn<U+2019>t deviate much from its blunt title: lyrics like "Sticks and stones may break my bones / But chains and whips excite me" feel forced, not daring".<ref>{{cite web|last=Skinner |first=James |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/music/reviews/x5fd |title=Music <U+2013> Review of Rihanna <U+2013> Loud |publisher=[[BBC]] |date=2010-11-15 |accessdate=2011-01-29}}</ref> ''[[USA Today]]''{{'}}s Steve Jones noted that Rihanna fails to shake off the "sexually aggressive tone" despite "shaking off the dark cloud of domestic violence that veiled 2009's ''Rated R''. Jones said "['S&M'] is ''Loud''{{'}}s pulsating opener. [Rihanna] makes it clear from the jump where she's headed as she acknowledges that chains and whips excite her".<ref>{{cite news|last=Jones |first=Steve |url=http://www.usatoday.com/life/music/reviews/2010-11-16-listen16_ST_N.htm |title=Listen Up: Rihanna is living out 'Loud' on new album |work=[[USA Today]] |date=2010-11-16 |accessdate=2011-01-29}}</ref> Genevieve Koski of ''[[The A.V. Club]]'' also noted that Rihanna's "sassy growl on 'S&M' just barely makes up for the lyric 'Sticks and stones may break my bones, but whips and chains excite me' [sic <U+2013> the actual line is 'chains and whips'] ".<ref>{{cite news|last=Koski |first=Genevieve |url=http://www.avclub.com/articles/rihanna-loud,48120/ |title=Rihanna: Loud: Music Review |work=[[The A.V.

In the United Kingdom, [[BBC Radio 1]] refused to play "S&M" before 7:00 PM due to the explicit nature of the lyrics. A spokesman for the radio station said "During daytime hours, as younger audiences are listening, we are playing the radio edit which is called Come On. However, we will continue to play the original track in specialist shows with an appropriate introduction... It is common practice to play radio edits of certain tracks in daytime."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.metro.co.uk/music/854875-rihannas-s-m-outrage-exposed-as-pr-stunt |title=BBC Radio 1 ban 'S&M' from daytime radio |work=[[Metro (British newspaper)|Metro]] |publisher=[[Associated Newspapers Ltd]] |date=2011-07-02 |accessdate=2011-05-06}}</ref> The song has since been re-edited and renamed "Come On" by the BBC, and features as such on the BBC's official chart show.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio1/chart/singles |title=Radio 1 <U+2013> The Official Chart with Reggie Yates |publisher=[[BBC]] |date= |accessdate=2011-02-16}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/music/news/a302430/rihanna-angered-by-single-rename.html |title=Rihanna angered by single rename |publisher=[[Digital Spy]] |date=2011-02-07 |accessdate=2011-02-16}}</ref>

=== Synopsis ===
[[File:Rihanna - S&M.jpg|thumb|Rihanna's press conference sees her taped to the wall behind in a sheet of plastic; she is surrounded by microphones]]
The video opens with Rihanna being dragged unwillingly into a press conference room, where she is promptly covered with plastic wrap and taped to the wall. She is surrounded by microphones as well as reporters sitting down taking notes, wearing ball gags.<ref name="bb"/> The video then cuts to an outdoor scene, where Rihanna wears a cream-colored latex dress and matching hat, walking gossip blogger [[Perez Hilton]] on a leash, who wears another ball gag. The scene changes to the singer sitting in a room with [[CCTV]] cameras pointed toward her. While she eats pink popcorn, the chair on which she was sitting starts rotating, prompting her to get up and whip a number of reporters taped to the wall of the room. Next she is shown rolling on the floor with her hands and feet tied, a scene reminiscing the bondage theme. As the bridge of the song approaches, Rihanna channels a ''[[Playboy (magazine)|Playboy]]'' bunny, wearing a white latex bikini and rabbit ears head piece, as projected images of headlines, such as rumors of "daddy" issues and her [[Illuminati]] ties, flash against her body as well as the wall behind her. 

Following the chorus she again appears in a newsroom, as reporters surround her and takes pictures, while lying across a desk wearing an pink latex dress. The end of the video intercuts scenes from the video in it's entirety, while introducing new scenes of Rihanna suggestively eating bananas, strawberries and cream, as well as bejeweled ice cream. The video ends with a shot of her lying on the newsroom desk wearing a smiley face eye patch and a [[The Rolling Stones]] tongue logo over her mouth. In addition to this, the video is intercut throughout with Rihanna, and various other people wearing dominatrix clothing, implying various sexual acts with the singer wearing a feather boa and a top with the word "censored" across it.<ref>{{cite web|last=Vena |first=Jocelyn |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1657302/rihanna-s-m-video-director.jhtml |title=Rihanna's 'S&M' Director Explains Video, Frame By Frame <U+2013> Music, Celebrity, Artist News |publisher=MTV.

The music video faced another controversy when allegations of plagiarism surfaced, involving the video's striking similarity to past ''[[Vogue Italia]]'' photo-shoots ranging from 1995<U+2013>2002 by [[David LaChapelle]], with [[RadarOnline]] reporting "In a side-by-side comparison between LaChapelle's previous work and screen captures of the Matsoukas directed music video, the similarities are indisputable <U+2013> with nearly identical sets, scenarios, and styling."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.radaronline.com/exclusives/2011/02/rihanna-accused-ripping-famed-photographer-s-m-video-see-photos |title=Rihanna Accused Of Ripping Off Famed Photographer In S&M Video |publisher=[[RadarOnline]] |date=2011-02-04 |accessdate=2011-02-05}}</ref> Several days after these comparisons came to light, LaChapelle sued Rihanna and Matsoukas for unspecified damages, claiming the music video was "directly derived" from his pictures, copying the "composition, total concept, feel, tone, mood, theme, colors, props, settings, decors, wardrobe and lighting" from "eight of his images."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-1353935/Rihannas-S-M-music-video-strikingly-similar-David-LaChapelles-work.html |title=Rihanna Sued by David LaChapelle Over 'Stealing of Images' |work=Daily Mail |date=2009-09-14 |accessdate=2011-02-22}}</ref> LaChappelle's lawsuit claimed that Rihanna "appropriated eight of his images" during the video for "S&M".<ref>{{cite web|author=Up for Discussion Jump to Forums |url=http://www.billboard.com/news/rihanna-sued-by-david-lachapelle-over-s-1005035202.story#/news/rihanna-sued-by-david-lachapelle-over-s-1005035202.story |title=Rihanna Sued by David LaChapelle Over 'S&M' Music Video |publisher=Prometheus Global Media|work=Billboard |date=2009-09-14 |accessdate=2011-02-22}}</ref>

[[File:Rihanna, LOUD Tour, Baltimore 5.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Rihanna performing "S&M" on the [[Loud Tour]], a performance similar to the one from the 2011 Billboard Music Awards.]]
Rihanna performed "S&M" for the first time at the [[2011 BRIT Awards]] on February 15, 2011, as a medley with her two previous singles from ''Loud'', "[[Only Girl (In the World)]]" and "[[What's My Name? (Rihanna song)|What's My Name?]]".<ref>{{cite news|first=Georgina|last= Littlejohn |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-1357385/Brit-Awards-2011-Rihanna-cleans-S-M-song-outfit.html |title=Brit Awards 2011: Rihanna cleans up S&M song but not her outfit  |work=Daily Mail |date= 2011-02-16|accessdate=2011-02-16 |location=London}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nme.com/news/rihanna/54993 |title=Rihanna and Cee Lo Green triumph at the Brit Awards |work=NME|publisher=IPC Media |date=2009-07-24 |accessdate=2011-02-16}}</ref> The singer was supposed to perform the full version of "S&M", for promoting the song's release as a single, however she was informed to "tone down" her performance by the show's bosses, thus performing only one verse and chorus in between "Only Girl (In The World)" and "What's My Name?". This was due to the BRIT Awards corporation trying to avoid receiving similar complaints about Rihanna on the final of the [[The X Factor (UK series 7)|seventh season]] of [[The X Factor (UK)|''The X Factor'']] on December 11, 2010, for wearing a provocative outfit and performing a suggestive dance routine before the watershed.<ref>{{cite news|author=Jody Thompson |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-1356393/Brit-Awards-2011-Rihanna-fuming-told-tone-S-M-performance.html |title=Brit Awards 2011: Rihanna 'fuming' after being told tone down S&M performance|work=Daily Mail |date= 2011-02-13|accessdate=2011-05-30 |location=London}}</ref> "S&M" was performed on the Australian leg of the [[Last Girl on Earth Tour]] in February and March 2011.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.safm.com.au/entertainment/music/popbuzz/blog/rihanna-wows-brisbane-with-last-girl-on-earth-gig/20110226-bj29.html|title=Rihanna Wows Brisbane with Last Girl on Earth Gig|publisher=Safm.com.au|date=2011-02-26 |accessdate=2011-02-26}}</ref>

Rihanna also performed "S&M" May 27, 2011 on [[NBC]]'s ''[[Today (NBC program)|Today]]'' show, as apart of the "Summer Concert Series", along with "Only Girl (In the World)", "What's My Name?" and "[[California King Bed]]", where she also gave an interview about the album as well as her performance at the Billboard Music Awards Spears.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-1391601/Rihanna-rocks-live-Rockefeller-Plaza.html?ito=feeds-newsxml |title=Rihanna gets a major hair makeover before taking to the stage as a sexy sailor |work=Daily Mail |date=2009-08-16 |accessdate=2011-05-30 |location=London}}</ref> The song is included on the set list of the [[Loud Tour]] with the performance beginning with the stage decorated as a S&M inspired set.
