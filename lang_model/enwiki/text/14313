The second season of the Canadian-American [[Animated cartoon|animated]] [[Television comedy|comedy]] television series ''[[Ed, Edd n Eddy]]'', created by [[Danny Antonucci]], originally aired on [[Cartoon Network]] from November 26, 1999, to December 22, 2000, and consisted of 26 episodes. The series revolves around three adolescent boys collectively known as "the Eds", who live in a suburban [[cul-de-sac]]. Unofficially led by Eddy, the Eds constantly scheme to make money off their peers in order to purchase their favorite confectionery, [[Gobstopper|jawbreakers]]. However, their plans usually fail, leaving them in various predicaments.

The [[Ed, Edd n Eddy (season 1)|first season]] was a success in [[Nielsen ratings]], prompting Cartoon Network for a November 1999 premiere. While the first season itself received generally positive reviews, the second season proved to be an improvement in reception, garnering general acclaim and earning two [[Leo Awards]], while the first received one.

''The Complete Second Season'' DVD was released in Region 1 in 2007. The ''Ed, Edd n Eddy'' DVD volume ''Edifying Ed-Ventures'', also featured season two episodes. Both DVDs were published by [[Warner Home Video]]. Many Cartoon Network compilation DVDs featured episodes from the season. It can also be purchased from the [[iTunes Store]]. It was written by Antonucci, [[Jono Howard]], Mike Kubat, and [[Robert Leighton (film editor)|Robert Leighton]].

==Development==
===Concept===
''Ed, Edd n Eddy'' follows the lives of three adolescent boys who all share variations of the name Ed, but differ greatly in their personalities. In the pursuit of buying jawbreakers and fitting in with the other kids, dimwitted Ed and intellectual Edd aid the self-appointed leader, Eddy, in his plans to scam the other children in their cul-de-sac out of their money during a perpetual summer vacation; however problems always ensue.<ref name="DVDTalk"/> The other children mostly dislike or show indifference to the Eds, though they all share a common fear of the Kanker Sisters, a group of teenage girls who live in the nearby "Park n' Flush" trailer park.<ref name="Drucker">{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2005/06/03/ed-edd-n-eddy-season-1-vol-1|title=Ed, Edd n Eddy: Season 1, Vol. 1|first=Mike|last=Duckers|work=IGN|publisher=News Corporation|date=June 3, 2005|accessdate=January 19, 2012}}</ref> The series takes place mostly within the fictional town of Peach Creek, and new locations were rarely introduced.<ref name="Season2DVD"/>

===Production and cast===
[[Danny Antonucci]], a [[cartoonist]] known for his edgy adult work such as ''[[Lupo the Butcher]]'' and ''[[The Brothers Grunt]]'',<ref name="Season1DVD">{{cite video|people=[[Danny Antonucci]]|date=October 10, 2006|title=Ed, Edd n Eddy: The Complete First Season<U+2014>''Interview with the Creator''|time=0:22<U+2013>2:34|format=DVD|publisher=[[Warner Home Video]]}}</ref> was dared by someone to prouduce a childrens cartoon.<ref name="Season2DVD"/> In 1996, Antonucci pitched ''Ed, Edd n Eddy'', which he concieved while designing a commercial, to [[Cartoon Network]] and [[Nickelodeon]]. After Cartoon Network agreed to give Antonucci creative control over the show, the series went in to production and premiered its first season on January 4, 1999.

According to Cartoon Network executive [[Linda Simensky]], the first season did "remarkably well" in ratings ever since its premiere, becoming one of the top-rated series on the network and prompting Cartoon Network to quickly order a second season for a November 1999 premiere,<ref name=TakeOne>{{cite journal|journal=[[Take One (Canadian magazine)|Take One]]|title=Ed, Edd 'n' Eddy: Three Guys, One 'Toon|date=June 22, 1999|first=Linda|last=Simensky|accessdate=September 20, 2012}}</ref> making it one of four seasons which ''Ed, Edd n Eddy'' was set to run.<ref name=OrderUp>{{cite web|url=http://www.awn.com/news/television/cartoon-net-greenlights-26-new-ed-edd-n-eddys|title=Cartoon Network Greenlights 26 New Ed, Edd n Eddys|accessdate=May 13, 2012|date=June 15, 2004|work=[[Animation World Network]]}}</ref> Antonucci stated that change in the characters from the first to the second season is "very" noticable, due to the ammount of development they've went through.<ref name="Season2DVD">{{cite video|people=[[Danny Antonucci]]|date=April 24, 2007|title=Ed, Edd n Eddy: The Complete Second Season<U+2014>''Behind the Eds''|format=DVD|publisher=[[Warner Home Video]]}}</ref> Antonucci directed the season, and co-wrote the episodes with [[Jono Howard]] and Mike Kubat, although [[Robert Leighton (film editor)|Robert Leighton]] was credited as a co-writer for "To Sir with Ed".<ref>''Ed, Edd n Eddy: The Complete Second Season'' credits</ref>

The cast mostly remained the same as in season one; [[Matt Hill]], [[Samuel Vincent]] and [[Tony Sampson]] were cast as Ed, Edd and Eddy, David Paul Grove as Jonny 2x4, [[Keenan Christenson]] as Jimmy, [[Janyse Jaud]] as Sarah and Lee Kanker, [[Kathleen Barr]] as Kevin and Marie, [[Peter Kelamis]] as Rolf, and [[Erin Fitzgerald]] as May Kanker, but [[Tabitha St. Germain]], the voice of Nazz, was replaced by Fitzgerald.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/tv/ed-edd-n-eddy/season-2/details|title=Ed, Edd n Eddy: Season 2|work=[[Metacritic]]|publisher=[[CBS Interactive]]|accessdate=January 22, 2013}}</ref>

In his review of ''The Complete Second Season'' DVD, David Cornelius of [[DVD Talk]] considered the Eds adolescent equivalents of [[The Three Stooges]],<ref name="DVDTalk">{{cite web|url=http://www.dvdtalk.com/reviews/28046/ed-edd-n-eddy-the-complete-second-season/|title=Ed, Edd 'n' Eddy <U+2014> The Complete Second Season|accessdate=July 31, 2007|last=Cornelius|first=David|date=April 24, 2007|work=[[DVD Talk]]}}</ref> believing: "The series revels in the sort of frantic, often gross humor kids love so much, and there's just enough oddball insanity at play to make adults giggle just as easily."<ref name="DVDTalk"/> Cornelius also concurred that the "animation is colorful and intentionally bizarre; bold lines forming the characters and backgrounds wiggle and morph in a delirious haze. This is animation that's, well, really animated."<ref name ="DVDTalk"/> In a review of the same DVD, Toon Zone praised the show's "strong" writting, "tight" animation and character designs and "excellent" stories, writing: "Perhaps the greatest thing about ''Ed, Edd n Eddy'' is how well it holds up to this day. It still feels 'new' and it's a ton of fun to watch, for the young and old. I really can't wait for the other seasons of this show to arrive on DVD<U+2014>it's great rewatching it after all of these years."<ref name="Toon Zone">{{cite web|title=Ed Edd n Eddy Continues to Impress...|url=http://news.toonzone.net/article.php?ID=16672|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070513143604/http://news.toonzone.net/article.php?ID=16672|archivedate=May 13, 2007|date=April 28, 2007|work=Toon Zone|accessdate=January 20, 2013}}</ref> The reviewer also said the season is a "definite improvement over the first".<ref name="Toon Zone"/> Both reviews "Highly Recommended" the DVD.<ref name="DVDTalk"/><ref name="Toon Zone"/>

| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2000|8|18}}
| ShortSummary = Rent-a-Ed: The Eds start the "Ed CirKus" with "The Flying Eduardo Brothers", but no one is impressed. During one of Ed's stunts, Ed falls from the slide and broke the teeter-totter. After Edd suggests that they should pay someone to fix it, Eddy gets the idea that they should start to work on things for money, which could be more successful than the circus. After the Eds attempt to fix Jimmy's oven, the Eds try to help Jonny, who has his head stuck in the tree. While they are in Jonny's house looking for soap, Ed stupidly pulls out Jonny's sink, leaving them stuck there until they fix it. After putting Jonny's sink together incorrectly, Ed pulls out a hot-water tank. The steam gives Eddy an idea, opening a sauna (in Jonny's house). This also fails miserably, however, after Rolf accidentally drops his towel and frightens everyone away. Things only get worse when Ed breaks the house's support beam and the entire house comes crashing down.
{{-}}Shoo Ed: When Jonny is being particularly annoying to Kevin, Eddy uses this opportunity to use Jonny to make money. They dress Jonny in a suit and tie, glue a block of wood to one of his shoes, feed him stinky anchovies, and send him around the cul-de-sac to annoy everyone. The Eds offer to get rid of Jonny for cash. However, it does not work on Rolf, who sees Jonny's bizarre behavior as customs from the old country.

The Eds, not wanting to stir Sarah's wrath, are forced to watch Jimmy. Jimmy and Ed start playing together, and Jimmy begins to copy Ed's behavior. Seeing how impressionable Jimmy is, Eddy decides that he'll turn Jimmy into the fourth Ed, and starts teaching him how to be just like him. The lesson works too well, as when Sarah returns, Jimmy one-ups Eddy, causing him to become Sarah's target.
{{-}}Mirror, Mirror, on the Ed: The Eds are taking a walk when they stumble on to the cul-de-sac kids playing Truth or Dare. The Eds want to join, but all the kids quit, leaving the boys alone.

{{-}}High Heeled Ed: The Eds plan to get big money with their "Sewer Swamp Ride", but Sarah, Jimmy, and Nazz are not impressed. When Eddy discovers this, he thinks Kevin, Rolf, and Jonny will come for the sewer ride. Sarah tells Eddy that they went go-karting and will not be back until dinner. The "Snuggle-Me-Ed" scam also fails to impress, so the Eds then get some gold paint and make "jewelry" to wow the more "sensitive" members of the cul-de-sac.
