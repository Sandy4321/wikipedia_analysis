A "'''Jiroft culture'''"<ref>Oscar White Muscarella,  [http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/Jiroft Jiroft] (2008), in: [[Encyclopedia Iranica]].

"For archeological accuracy the terms <U+201C>Jiroft<U+201D> or <U+201C>Jiroft culture<U+201D> employed to define a specific ancient Iranian culture and its artifacts should only be cited within quotation marks. All the artifacts known to date that are accorded the Jiroft label have not been excavated; they have in fact been plundered."</ref> has been postulated as an [[early Bronze Age]] (late 3rd millennium BC) [[archaeological culture]], located in what is now [[Iran]]'s [[Sistan]] and [[Kerm<U+0101>n Province]]s.
The hypothesis is based on a collection of artifacts that were confiscated in [[Iran]] and accepted by many to have derived from the [[Jiroft]] area in south central [[Iran]], reported by online Iranian news services, beginning in 2001.

The proposed type site is [[Konar Sandal]], near  [[Jiroft]] in the [[Halil River]] area. Other significant sites associated with the culture include; [[Shahr-e Sukhteh]] (Burnt City), [[Tepe Bampur]], [[Espiedej]], [[Shahdad]], [[Tal-i-Iblis]] and [[Tepe Yahya]].

The proposition of grouping these sites as an  "independent [[Bronze Age]] [[civilization]] with its own architecture and language", intermediate between [[Elam]] to the west and the [[Indus Valley Civilization]] to the east, is due to [[Yousef Majidzadeh]], head of the archaeological excavation team in [[Jiroft]]. He speculates they may be the remains of the lost [[Aratta]] Kingdom, but his conclusions have met with skepticism from some reviewers.
Other conjectures (e.g. Daniel T. Potts, Piotr Steinkeller) have connected the [[Konar Sandal]] with the obscure city-state of [[Marhashi]], that apparently lay to the east of [[Elam]] proper.

==Discovery and excavation==
Many artifacts associated with Jiroft were recovered from looters described as "destitute villagers" who had scavenged the area south of [[Jiroft]] before 2001, when a team led by [[Yousef Majidzadeh]] began excavations. The team uncovered more than two square kilometers of remains from a city dating back to at least the late 3rd millennium BC. The data Madjidzadeh's team has gathered demonstrates that Jiroft's heyday was from 2500 B.C. to 2200 B.C [http://archive.archaeology.org/1001/abstracts/insider.html<ref>http://archive.archaeology.org/1001/abstracts/insider.html</ref>].

The looted artifacts and some vessels recovered by the excavators were of the so-called "intercultural style" type of pottery known from Mesopotamia and the Iranian Plateau, and since the 1960s from nearby [[Tepe Yahya]] in Baft. The "Jiroft civilization" hypothesis proposes that this "intercultural style" is in fact the distinctive style of a previously unknown, long-lived civilization.{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}}

This is not universally accepted. Archaeologist [[Oscar Muscarella]] of the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] criticizes that the excavators resorted to sensationalist announcements while being more slow in publishing scholarly reports, and their claims that the site's [[stratigraphy]] shows continuity into the 4th millennium as overly optimistic. Muscarella does nevertheless acknowledge the importance of the site.

Earlier excavations at [[Kerman]] were conducted by [[Marc Aurel Stein|Sir Aurel Stein]] around 1930.

One of the most notable archaeological excavations done in [[Kerman Province]] was one done by a group led by Professor [[Joseph Caldwell]] from [[Illinois State Museum]] in 1966 (Tal-i-Iblis) and [http://www.fas.harvard.edu/~anthro/karlovsky Lamberg-Karlovsky] from [[Harvard University]] in 1967 (Tepe Yahya [[Sogan Valley]], [[Dolatabad]]).

Archeological excavations in Jiroft led to the discovery of several objects belonging to the fourth millennium BC.

According to Majidzadeh, geophysical operations by French experts in the region indicate the existence at least 10 historical and archaeological periods in the region belonging to different civilizations who lived in this area during different periods of time in history. According to the [[France|French]] experts who studied this area, the evidence remained from these civilizations may be traced up to 11 meters under the ground.

:<U+201C>What is obvious is that the evidence of Tal-i-Iblis culture in Bardsir can be traced in all parts of the region. Tal-i-Iblis culture, known as Ali Abad period (fourth millennium BC) was revealed by [[Joe Caldwell (archaeologist)|Joseph R. Caldwell]], American archaeologist,<U+201D>{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}} said Majidzadeh.

==Jiroft site==
{{main|Konar Sandal}}
The primary Jiroft site,  consists of two mounds a few kilometers apart, called Konar Sandal A and B with a height of 13 and 21 meters, respectively (approximate location {{coord|28.5|N|57.8|E|}}). At Konar Sandal B, a two-story, windowed citadel with a base of close to 13.5 hectares was found.

==Writing system==
The inscription, discovered in a palace, was carved on a brick whose lower left corner only has remained, explained Yousof Majid Zadeh, head of the Jiroft excavation team.<ref>http://edition.presstv.ir/detail/29784.html</ref>

<U+201C>The two remaining lines are enough to recognize the Elamite script," he added.

<U+201C>The only ancient inscriptions known to experts before the Jiroft discovery were cuneiform and hieroglyph,<U+201D> said Majid Zadeh, adding that<U+201D> The new-found inscription is formed by geometric shapes and no linguist around the world has been able to decipher it yet.<U+201D>

Archeologists have found many artifacts confirming the existence of a rich civilization dating back to the third millennium BC, during the 5 previous excavational phases.

The sixth phase of Jiroft excavations will focus on the temple and the sites where the tablets were found during previous phases.

Archeologists believe the discovered inscription is the most ancient script found so far and that the Elamite written language originated in Jiroft, where the writing system developed first and was then spread across the country.<ref>http://edition.presstv.ir/detail/29784.html</ref>
