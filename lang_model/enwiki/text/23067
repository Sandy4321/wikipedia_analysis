'''Richard Cordray''' (born May 3, 1959) is an American politician of the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] who last served as the [[Attorney General of Ohio]]. He has been chosen to run the enforcement division of the [[United States Consumer Financial Protection Bureau]], which officially began operating in July 2011. On July 17, 2011, President [[Barack Obama]] announced he would nominate Cordray to lead the [[United States Consumer Financial Protection Bureau]].

Cordray was elected Attorney General of Ohio in November 2008 to fill the remainder of the unexpired term ending January 2011. On November 2, 2010, Cordray lost his bid for re-election to former Lt. Governor and U.S. Senator [[Mike DeWine]]. Prior to his Attorney General position, Cordray served as the [[Ohio State Treasurer]] and as [[treasurer]] of [[Franklin County, Ohio]]. He has also previously served as a member of the [[Ohio House of Representatives]] (1991&ndash;1993) and as the first [[Solicitor General of Ohio|Ohio state solicitor]] (1993&ndash;1994).

Cordray was a [[Marshall Scholar]] at [[University of Oxford|Oxford University]], 1981&ndash;83.  Later, he was editor-in-chief of the ''[[University of Chicago Law Review]]'' and subsequently served as a [[law clerk]] for Justice [[Anthony Kennedy]] of the [[Supreme Court of the United States]]. In 1987 he became an undefeated five-time ''[[Jeopardy!]]'' champion.

After his seat in the Ohio House of Representatives was [[redistricting|redistricted]] in 1992, Cordray ran unsuccessfully that year for a [[United States House of Representatives]] seat. The following year he was appointed by the office of the Ohio attorney general as the first Ohio state solicitor. His experience as Solicitor has led to his arguing six cases before the United States Supreme Court, where he had previously clerked.  Following Republican victories in Ohio statewide elections in 1994, Cordray left his appointed position to pursue private practice of law before becoming Franklin County treasurer in 2002. While in private practice he made unsuccessful runs for Ohio attorney general in 1998  and [[United States Senate|United States senator]] in 2000.  Cordray won re-election as Franklin County treasurer before being elected state treasurer in 2006.

===Law career===
While in private practice in 1993, Cordray co-wrote a [[legal brief]] for the [[Anti-Defamation League]], in a campaign supported by Ohio's attorney general, for the reinstatement of Ohio's [[hate crime]] laws.  This was considered by the U.S. Supreme Court, but not ruled on because of its similarity to a previous Wisconsin ruling.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://docs.newsbank.com/openurl?ctx_ver=z39.88-2004&rft_id=info:sid/iw.newsbank.com:NewsBank:CLDB&rft_val_format=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:ctx&rft_dat=10E0DA52E6B3F580&svc_dat=InfoWeb:aggregated5&req_dat=0D0CB579A3BDA420|title=Ohio's Justices Asked to Reinstate Hate-Crimes Law|accessdate=2008-10-19|date=1993-09-12|publisher=[[Newsbank]]|work=[[The Columbus Dispatch]]|author=Bradshaw, James}}</ref>

In 1993 the [[government of Ohio]] created the office of state solicitor general to handle the state's appellate work. The state solicitor, appointed by the Ohio attorney general, is responsible for cases that are to be argued before the [[Ohio Supreme Court]] and the United States Supreme Court. Until 1998, the Solicitor worked without any support staff.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ohiobar.org/pubs/secnewslet/index.asp?section=Litigation&Issue=10;1&ID=665|title=State solicitor: An appellate lawyer<U+2019>s dream|accessdate=2008-10-16|date=Spring 2003|publisher=Ohio State Bar Association|work=Ohio State Bar Association Section Newsletters|author=Gormley, David M.}}</ref> Cordray, who had earlier worked for a summer in the office of the [[United States Solicitor General|United States solicitor general]],<ref name=FASG>{{cite news|url=http://docs.newsbank.com/openurl?ctx_ver=z39.88-2004&rft_id=info:sid/iw.newsbank.com:NewsBank:CPDB&rft_val_format=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:ctx&rft_dat=0F80775E9D40AFDF&svc_dat=InfoWeb:aggregated5&req_dat=0D0CB579A3BDA420|title=Fisher Appoints Solicitor General|accessdate=2008-12-14|date=1993-09-19|publisher=[[Newsbank]]|work=[[The Plain Dealer]]|author=Suddes, Thomas}}</ref> was the first Solicitor to be appointed, in September 1993.<ref name=FASG/> He held the position until he resigned after Ohio Attorney General [[Lee Fisher]] was defeated by [[Betty Montgomery]] in 1994.<ref name=TUSC>{{cite web|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/washington/stories/2000/12/18/focus5.html|title=The U.S. Supreme Court: making a lawyer's career|accessdate=2008-10-16|date=2000-12-15|publisher=American City Business Journals, Inc.|work=Business First of Columbus|author=Buchanan, Doug}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://docs.newsbank.com/openurl?ctx_ver=z39.88-2004&rft_id=info:sid/iw.newsbank.com:NewsBank:CLDB&rft_val_format=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:ctx&rft_dat=10E07D5B2669A9F8&svc_dat=InfoWeb:aggregated5&req_dat=0D0CB579A3BDA420|title=New Solicitor General Named By Montgomery - Jeffrey S.

Cordray contested the [[Ku Klux Klan]]'s right to erect a cross at the [[Ohio Statehouse]] after the state's Capitol Square Review and Advisory Board denied the Klan's request during the 1993 Christmas holiday. He argued that the symbolic meaning of the cross was different from the [[Christmas tree]] and [[Menorah (Hanukkah)|menorah]], which the state permits. The Klan prevailed in the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals on December 21, 1993, and erected a 10-foot (3&nbsp;m) cross the following day.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://docs.newsbank.com/openurl?ctx_ver=z39.88-2004&rft_id=info:sid/iw.newsbank.com:NewsBank:CLDB&rft_val_format=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:ctx&rft_dat=10E0DACFE0B58900&svc_dat=InfoWeb:aggregated5&req_dat=0D0CB579A3BDA420|title=Klan May Raise Cross, Judge Rules|accessdate=2008-10-19|date=1993-12-22|publisher=[[Newsbank]]|work=[[The Columbus Dispatch]]|author=Edwards, Randall}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://docs.newsbank.com/openurl?ctx_ver=z39.88-2004&rft_id=info:sid/iw.newsbank.com:NewsBank:ABJB&rft_val_format=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:ctx&rft_dat=0EB62FEFCEA9BFC2&svc_dat=InfoWeb:aggregated5&req_dat=0D0CB579A3BDA420|title=Judge OKS New Cross By Klan Display To Be Erected Outside Statehouse|accessdate=2008-10-19|date=1993-12-22|publisher=[[Newsbank]]|work=[[Akron Beacon Journal]]}}</ref> The same board denied the Klan a permit to rally on [[Martin Luther King Day]] (January 15, 1994) due to the group's failure to pay a $15,116 bill from its Oct. 23 rally and its refusal to post a bond to cover expenses for the proposed rally.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://docs.newsbank.com/openurl?ctx_ver=z39.88-2004&rft_id=info:sid/iw.newsbank.com:NewsBank:ABJB&rft_val_format=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:ctx&rft_dat=0EB62FF59399D75B&svc_dat=InfoWeb:aggregated5&req_dat=0D0CB579A3BDA420|title=State Stops Klan Rally On King's Birthday Board Cites Unpaid Bill For Earlier Event, Plus Concern For Public Safety|accessdate=2008-10-19|date=1994-01-07|publisher=[[Newsbank]]|work=[[The Plain Dealer]]}}</ref> When the same 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals overturned the decision to deny the 1994 permit, the state chose not to appeal.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://docs.newsbank.com/openurl?ctx_ver=z39.88-2004&rft_id=info:sid/iw.newsbank.com:NewsBank:CPDB&rft_val_format=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:ctx&rft_dat=0F807C33C868C2E3&svc_dat=InfoWeb:aggregated5&req_dat=0D0CB579A3BDA420|title=State Won't Appeal KKK Holiday Rally|accessdate=2008-10-19|date=1994-01-07|publisher=[[Newsbank]]|work=[[The Plain Dealer]]}}</ref> The following year the Klan again applied to erect a cross for the Christmas holiday season, and the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals concurred with the prior ruling.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://docs.newsbank.com/openurl?ctx_ver=z39.88-2004&rft_id=info:sid/iw.newsbank.com:NewsBank:CLDB&rft_val_format=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:ctx&rft_dat=10E081C85D311D30&svc_dat=InfoWeb:aggregated5&req_dat=0D0CB579A3BDA420|title=KKK Wins Round in Statehouse Cross Dispute|accessdate=2008-10-19|date=1994-07-26|publisher=[[Newsbank]]|work=[[The Columbus Dispatch]]|author=Edwards, Randall}}</ref> The United States Supreme Court did not agree to hear arguments on the topic until a few weeks after Cordray resigned from his solicitor general position.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://docs.newsbank.com/openurl?ctx_ver=z39.88-2004&rft_id=info:sid/iw.newsbank.com:NewsBank:CLDB&rft_val_format=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:ctx&rft_dat=10E07CE5EE3B6748&svc_dat=InfoWeb:aggregated5&req_dat=0D0CB579A3BDA420|title=High Court Takes KKK Cross Case - U.S. Justices Expected to Decide By July on Statehous Display|accessdate=2008-10-19|date=1995-01-14|publisher=[[Newsbank]]|work=[[The Columbus Dispatch]]|author=Lowe, Roger K.}}</ref> After his resignation in 1994 he several times represented the federal government in the U.S. Supreme Court: two of Cordray's appearances before were by appointment of the Democratic [[Bill Clinton]] [[United States Department of Justice|Justice Department]] and two were by the Republican [[George W.
