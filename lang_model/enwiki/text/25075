'''Nellie Bly''' (May 5, 1864<ref>Kroeger 1994 reports (p. 529) that although a birth year of 1867 was deduced from the age Bly claimed to be at the height of her popularity, her baptismal record confirms 1864.</ref> &ndash; January 27, 1922) was the [[pen name]] of American pioneer [[Women in journalism and media professions|female journalist]] '''Elizabeth Jane Cochrane'''. She remains notable for two feats: a record-breaking [[circumnavigation|trip around the world]] in emulation of [[Jules Verne]]'s character Phileas Fogg, and an [[Expos<U+00E9> (journalism)|expos<U+00E9>]] in which she [[faked insanity]] to study a mental institution from within. In addition to her writing, she was also an industrialist and charity worker. She originally intended for her pseudonym to be "Nelly Bly," but her editor wrote "Nellie" by mistake, and the error stuck.

==Early years==
[[File:Nellie Bly-White Slave-06.png|thumb|left|Nellie Bly working in a factory producing boxes]]
Bly was born '''Elizabeth Jane Cochran''' in Cochrans Mills, Pennsylvania--the present day [[Pittsburgh]] suburb of [[South Park Township, Allegheny County, Pennsylvania|South Park Township]] along [[Lick Run (Allegheny County, Pennsylvania)|Lick Run]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://pghbridges.com/glassport/0587-4460/cochransmillrd_lickrun.htm  |title=Cochran's Mill Rd over Licks Run |last1= Cridlebaugh |first1= Bruce S. |date=14 October 2002 |work=Bridges & Tunnels of Allegheny County and Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania  |publisher= |accessdate=23 December 2010}}</ref> bordering [[Jefferson Hills, Pennsylvania|Jefferson Hills]]. Her father, Michael Cochran, was a modest laborer and mill worker who married Mary Jane. Cochran taught his young children a cogent lesson about the virtues of hard work and determination, buying the local mill and most of the land surrounding his family farmhouse.  He eventually owned so much property near the [[Bridge in Jefferson Borough]], that the settlement was re-named Cochran's Mills. As a young girl Bly was often called "Pinky," because she so frequently wore the color. As she became a teenager she wanted to portray herself as more sophisticated, and so dropped the nickname and changed her surname to '''Cochrane'''.<ref>Kroeger 1994, p. 25.</ref>  She attended [[boarding school]] for one term, but was forced to drop out due to lack of funds.
''
In 1880, Bly and her family moved to nearby [[Pittsburgh]].  An aggressively misogynistic column in the ''[[Pittsburgh Dispatch]]'' prompted her to write a fiery rebuttal to the editor with the pen name "Lonely Orphan Girl."  The editor was so impressed with Bly's earnestness and spirit that he asked the man who wrote the letter to join the paper. When he learned the man was Bly, he refused to give her the job, but she was a good talker and persuaded him. Female newspaper writers at that time customarily used pen names, and for Bly the editor chose "Nellie Bly", adopted from the [[title character]] in the popular song "Nelly Bly" by [[Stephen Foster]].

As a writer, Bly focused her early work for the ''Dispatch'' on the plight of working women, writing a series of investigative articles on female factory workers.  But editorial pressure pushed her to the so-called [[Society reporting|"women's pages"]] to cover fashion, society, and gardening, the usual role for female journalists of the day.  Dissatisfied with these duties, she took the initiative and traveled to Mexico to serve as a [[foreign correspondent]]. Still only 21, she spent nearly half a year reporting the lives and customs of the [[Mexican people]]; her dispatches were later published in book form as ''[[Six Months in Mexico]]''.  In one report, she protested the imprisonment of a local journalist for criticizing the Mexican government, then a dictatorship under [[Porfirio D<U+00ED>az]].  When Mexican authorities learned of Bly's report, they threatened her with arrest, prompting her to leave the country.  Safely home, she denounced D<U+00ED>az as a tyrannical czar suppressing the Mexican people and [[freedom of the press|controlling the press]].

==Asylum expos<U+00E9>==
{{Main|Ten Days in a Mad-House}}
[[File:Nellie Bly-Mad-House-07.png|thumb|Nellie being examined by a psychiatrist]] 
Burdened again with theater and arts reporting, Bly left the ''Pittsburgh Dispatch'' in 1887 for [[New York City]].  Penniless after four months, she talked her way into the offices of [[Joseph Pulitzer]]'s newspaper, the ''[[New York World]]'', and took an [[Undercover journalism|undercover assignment]] for which she agreed to feign insanity to investigate reports of brutality and neglect at the Women's Lunatic Asylum on Blackwell's Island.

After a night of practicing deranged expressions in front of a mirror, she checked into a working-class [[boardinghouse]].  She refused to go to bed, telling the boarders that she was afraid of them and that they looked crazy. They soon decided that ''she'' was crazy, and the next morning summoned the police. Taken to a courtroom, she pretended to have [[amnesia]]. The judge concluded she had been drugged.

She was then examined by several doctors, who all declared her to be insane. "Positively demented," said one, "I consider it a hopeless case.  She needs to be put where someone will take care of her."<ref name=Bly1887>Bly 1887.</ref>  The head of the insane pavilion at [[Bellevue Hospital]] pronounced her "undoubtedly insane".  The case of the "pretty crazy girl" attracted media attention: "Who Is This Insane Girl?" asked the ''[[New York Sun (historical)|New York Sun]]''.  ''[[The New York Times]]'' wrote of the "mysterious waif" with the "wild, hunted look in her eyes", and her desperate cry: "I can't remember  I can't remember."<ref>Kroeger 1994, pp. 91&ndash;92.</ref>

Committed to the asylum, Bly experienced its conditions firsthand. The food consisted of gruel broth, spoiled beef, bread that was little more than dried dough, and dirty undrinkable water. The dangerous patients were tied together with ropes. The patients were made to sit for much of each day on hard benches with scant protection from the cold. Waste was all around the eating places. Rats crawled all around the hospital. The bathwater was frigid, and buckets of it were poured over their heads.  The nurses were obnoxious and abusive, telling the patients to shut up, and beating them if they did not. Speaking with her fellow patients, Bly was convinced that some were as sane as she was. On the effect of her experiences, she wrote:

<blockquote>What, excepting torture, would produce insanity quicker than this treatment?  Here is a class of women sent to be cured.  I would like the expert physicians who are condemning me for my action, which has proven their ability, to take a perfectly sane and healthy woman, shut her up and make her sit from 6 a.m. until 8 p.m. on straight-back benches, do not allow her to talk or move during these hours, give her no reading and let her know nothing of the world or its doings, give her bad food and harsh treatment, and see how long it will take to make her insane. Two months would make her a mental and physical wreck.<ref name=Bly1887/></blockquote>

<blockquote><U+2026>My teeth chattered and my limbs were <U+2026>numb with cold. Suddenly, I got three buckets of ice-cold water<U+2026>one in my eyes, nose and mouth.</blockquote>

After ten days, Bly was released from the asylum at ''The World'''s behest. Her report, later published in book form as ''[[Ten Days in a Mad-House]]'', caused a sensation and brought her lasting fame.  While embarrassed physicians and staff fumbled to explain how so many professionals had been fooled, a [[grand jury]] launched its own investigation into conditions at the asylum, inviting Bly to assist. The jury's report recommended the changes she had proposed, and its call for increased funds for care of the insane prompted an $850,000 increase in the budget of the Department of Public Charities and Corrections. They also made sure that future examinations were more thorough so that only the seriously ill actually went to the asylum.

In 1888, Bly suggested to her editor at the ''New York World'' that she  take a trip around the world, attempting to turn the fictional ''[[Around the World in Eighty Days (novel)|Around the World in Eighty Days]]'' into fact for the first time. A year later, at 9:40 a.m. on November 14, 1889, and with two days' notice,<ref name="Ruddick, Nicholas 1999, p. 4">Ruddick, Nicholas. <U+201C>Nellie Bly, Jules Verne, and the World on the Threshold of the American Age.<U+201D> ''Canadian Review of American Studies'', Volume 29, Number 1, 1999, p. 4</ref> she boarded the ''Augusta Victoria'', a steamer of the Hamburg America Line,<ref name="Kroeger, Brooke 1994, p. 146">Kroeger, Brooke.

The New York newspaper ''[[Cosmopolitan (magazine)|Cosmopolitan]]'' sponsored its own reporter, [[Elizabeth Bisland]], to beat the time of both Phileas Fogg and Bly.

On her travels around the world, Bly went through England, France (where she met [[Jules Verne]] in [[Amiens]]), [[Brindisi]], the [[Suez Canal]], [[Colombo]] ([[Sri Lanka|Ceylon]]), the Straits Settlements of [[Penang]] and [[Singapore]], [[Hong Kong]], and [[Japan]].

==Later years==
[[File:Nelly Bly patent.png|thumb|left|Patent for an improved Milk-Can]]
[[File:Nellie Bly later years.jpg|thumb|Nellie Bly in her later years]]
In 1895 Nellie Bly married millionaire manufacturer [[Robert Seaman]], who was 40 years her senior. She retired from journalism, and became the president of the Iron Clad Manufacturing Co., which made steel containers such as milk cans and boilers. In 1904, her husband died.  In the same year, Iron Clad began manufacturing  the steel barrel that was the model for the 55-gallon [[Drum (container)|oil drum]] still in widespread use in the United States. Although there have been claims that Nellie Bly invented the barrel,<ref>http://aoghs.org/technology/the-remarkable-nellie-bly/</ref> the inventor is believed to have been Henry Wehrhahn, who likely assigned his invention to her. (US Patents 808,327 and 808,413).<ref>http://www.businesshistory.com/ind._oil2.php</ref> Nellie Bly was, however, an inventor in her own right, receiving US patent 697,553 for a novel milk can and US patent 703,711 for a stacking garbage can, both under her married name of Elizabeth Cochrane Seaman.<ref>http://www.google.com/patents</ref> For a time she was one of the leading female industrialists in the United States, but embezzlement by employees forced her into bankruptcy. Forced back into reporting, she covered such events as the [[women's suffrage]] convention in 1913, and stories on Europe's [[Eastern Front (World War I)|Eastern Front]] during [[World War I]].<ref>''The remarkable Nellie Bly, inventor of the metal oil drum'', Petroleum Age, 12/2006, p.5.</ref>

[[File:The Grave of Nellie Bly in Woodlawn Cemetery.JPG|thumb|The grave of Nellie Bly in [[Woodlawn Cemetery (Bronx, New York)|Woodlawn Cemetery]]]]In 1916 Nellie was given a baby boy whose mother requested Nellie look after him and see that he become adopted.  The child was illegitimate and difficult to place since he was [[biracial|half-Japanese]]. He spent the next six years in an orphanage run by the Church For All Nations {{Clarify|date=November 2008}} in Manhattan.

As Nellie became ill towards the end of her life she requested that her niece, Beatrice Brown, look after the boy and several other babies in whom she had become interested.  Her interest in orphanages may have been part of her ongoing efforts to improve the social organizations of the day.

She died of [[pneumonia]] at St. Mark's Hospital in New York City in 1922, at age 57.<ref>{{Cite journal |last1= |first1= |authorlink= |date=28 January 1922 |title=Nellie Bly, Journalist, Dies of Pneumonia |journal=The New York Times |publisher=The New York Times Co. |url=http://www.nytimes.com/learning/general/onthisday/bday/0505.html |accessdate=29 November 2011 }}</ref>  She was interred in a modest grave at [[Woodlawn Cemetery (Bronx, New York)|Woodlawn Cemetery]] in [[the Bronx]].<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Dunning |first1=Jennifer |authorlink=Jennifer Dunning |date=23 February 1979 |title=Woodlawn, Bronx's Other Hall of Fame |journal=The New York Times |publisher=The New York Times Co. |url=http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F70911F63D5D12728DDDAA0A94DA405B898BF1D3 |accessdate=29 November 2011 }}</ref>
