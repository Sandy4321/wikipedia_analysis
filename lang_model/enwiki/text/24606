'''Farleigh Hungerford Castle''', sometimes called '''Farleigh Castle''' or '''Farley Castle''', is a [[medieval]] [[castle]] in [[Farleigh Hungerford]], [[Somerset]], England. The castle was built in two phases: the inner court was constructed between 1377 and 1383 by Sir [[Thomas Hungerford (Speaker)|Thomas Hungerford]], who made his fortune working as a [[Steward (office)|steward]] to [[John of Gaunt]]. The castle was built to a [[quadrangular castle|quadrangular]] design, already slightly old-fashioned, on the site of an existing [[manor house]] overlooking the [[River Frome, Somerset|River Frome]]. A [[medieval deer park|park]] was attached to the castle, requiring the destruction of a local village. His son, Sir [[Walter Hungerford, 1st Baron Hungerford|Walter Hungerford]], a successful knight and courtier to [[Henry V of England|Henry V]], became rich during the [[Hundred Years War]] with France and extended the castle with an additional, outer court, enclosing the parish church in the process. By Walter's death in 1397, the substantial castle was richly appointed and its [[chapel]] decorated with [[mural]]s.

The castle largely remained in the hands of the Hungerford family over the next two centuries, despite periods during the [[War of the Roses]] in which it was held by the Crown following the [[Attainder|attaintment]] and [[execution]] of members of the family. At the outbreak of the [[English Civil War]] in 1642, the castle, modernised to the latest [[Tudor]] and [[Stuart]] fashions, was held by Sir Edward Hungerford. Edward declared his support for [[Parliament]], leading their faction in [[Wiltshire]]. Farleigh Hungerford was seized by [[Cavaliers|Royalist]] forces in 1643, but recaptured by Parliament without a fight near the end of the conflict in 1645. As a result it escaped [[slighting]] following the war, unlike many other castles in south-west of England.

The final member of the Hungerford family, Sir Edward Hungerford, inherited the castle in 1657, but his [[gambling]] and expensive living forced him to sell the property in 1686. By the 18th century the castle was no longer lived in by its owners and fell in disrepair; in 1730 it was bought by the Houlton family, and broken up for salvage. [[Antiquarian]] and [[tourist]] interest in the now ruined castle increased through the 18th and 19th centuries. The castle chapel was repaired in 1779 and became a museum of curiosities, complete with the murals rediscovered on its walls in 1844 and a number of rare [[lead]] anthropomorphic coffins from the mid-17th century. In the 1915 Farleigh Hungerford Castle was sold to the [[Office of Works]] and a controversial restoration programme began. It now owned by [[English Heritage]], who operate it as a [[tourist attraction]], and the castle is a Grade I [[listed building]] and a [[Scheduled Ancient Monument]].

After the [[Norman Conquest]] of England, the [[manorialism|manor]] of [[Farleigh Hungerford|Ferlege]] in [[Somerset]] was granted by [[William the Conqueror]] to Roger de Courcelles.<ref>Mackenzie, p.57.</ref> Ferlege was a corruption of the [[Anglo-Saxon]] name ''faern-laega'', meaning "the ferny pasture", and was in turn itself later corrupted to Farleigh.<ref name=KightlyP17>Kightly, p.17.</ref> [[William Rufus]] gave the manor to Hugh de Montfort, who renamed it Farleigh Montfort.<ref>Mackenzie, p.57; Kightly, p.17.</ref> The manor passed from the Montfort family to Bartholomew de Bunghersh in the early years of the reign of [[Edward III of England|Edward III]].<ref name=dunning/>

[[Thomas Hungerford (Speaker)|Sir Thomas Hungerford]] bought the property from the de Bunghersh family in 1369 for <U+00A3>733.<ref name=dunning>Dunning, pp.57-8.</ref>{{#tag:ref|It is impossible to accurately compare 14th century and modern prices or incomes. For comparison, <U+00A3>733 represents slightly more than the yearly income of a typical nobleman such as [[Richard le Scrope, 1st Baron Scrope of Bolton|Richard le Scrope]], whose lands brought in around <U+00A3>600 a year.<ref>Given-Wilson, p.157.</ref>|group="nb"}} By 1385 the manor was known as Farley Hungerford, after its new owner.<ref name=KightlyP17/> Sir Thomas Hungerford was a knight and courtier, who became wealthy as the Chief Steward to the powerful [[John of Gaunt]] and then the first recorded [[Speaker of the British House of Commons|Speaker]] of the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]].<ref name=KightlyP17/> Thomas decided to make Farleigh Hungerford his principal home and, between 1377 and 1383, built a castle on the site; unfortunately he did not acquire the appropriate [[Crenellation#License to crenellate|licence to crenellate]] from the king before commencing building, and Thomas had to acquire a royal pardon in 1383.<ref>Kightly, p.18; Miles and Saunder, p.165; ''[http://homepage.mac.com/philipdavis/LOC/13831126.html Licence to crenellate Farleigh Hungerford Castle granted 1383&nbsp;Nov&nbsp;26]'', The Gatehouse, accessed 2 August 2011.</ref>

Thomas's new castle adapted the existing manor complex overlooking the head of the [[River Frome]].<ref>Emery, p.553.</ref> Although the castle sat on a low spur it was overlooked by higher ground from the west and the north and was not ideally placed from a purely defensive perspective.<ref>Miles and Saunders, p.165.</ref> Contemporary castle designs included the construction of huge, palatial tower keeps and apartments for the most powerful nobles, such as [[Kenilworth Castle|Kenilworth]], expanded by Thomas's patron, John of Gaunt; or the construction of smaller, French influenced castles such as that seen at nearby [[Nunney Castle]], built by one of Thomas's fellow ''[[nouveau riche]]'' landowners.<ref>Emery, p.533.</ref> By contrast, Farleigh Hungerford drew on the tradition of [[quadrangular castle]]s that had begun in France during the early 13th century, in which the traditional buildings of an unfortified manor were enclosed by a four-sided outer wall and protected with corner towers.<ref>Gondoin, p.167; Johnson, p.167.</ref> The style was well established by the late 14th century, even slightly old fashioned.<ref>Emery, p.533.</ref>

The castle was formed around a court, later called the inner court, enclosed by a curtain wall with a circular tower on each corner and a gatehouse at the front; the north-east tower was larger than the others, perhaps to provide additional defences.<ref>Kightly, pp.5, 9.</ref> Over time the towers acquired their own names: the north-west tower was called the Hazelwell Tower; the north-east the Redcap Tower and the south-west the Lady Tower.<ref>Kightly, pp.8-10.</ref>{{#tag:ref|The Hazelwell Tower's name results from a nearby [[Spring (hydrosphere)|spring]] of water; the Redcap from rumours of an evil spirit or possibly from the colour of its original roof; the "Lady" from the mistaken belief that Elizabeth Hungerford was kept there in the 1530s.<ref>Kightly, pp.8-10, 24.</ref>|group="nb"}} The ground fell away sharply on most sides of the castle, but its south and west sides were protected with a wet [[moat]], using a dam fed from a nearby [[Spring (hydrosphere)|spring]] using a pipe.<ref>Kightly, pp.11, 33.</ref> The gatehouse had twin towers and a [[drawbridge]].<ref name=KightlyP7>Kightly, p.7.</ref>

Opposite the entrance, and running across the middle of the court, was the [[great hall]] of the castle, with a grand [[porch]] and steps leading up to the first floor, where prestigious guests would have been entertained amongst carved wall-panels and [[mural]]s.<ref name=KightlyP7/> The design of the hall may have emulated Gaunt's hall at Kenilworth; at the very least, it was a powerful symbol of Thomas's authority and status.<ref>Johnson, p.169.</ref> The west side of the inner court included the castle kitchen, bakery, well and other service facilities; on the east side was the lord's great chamber and a range of other accommodation for other guests.<ref>Kightly, pp.7, 10.</ref> Behind the great hall was a smaller courtyard or garden.<ref>Kightly, p.33.</ref> Thomas appears to built up his new castle in stages, with the curtain wall being built first, with the corner towers added afterwards.<ref name=KightlyP17/>

A [[medieval deer park|park]] was established next to the castle; a park was highly prestigious and it enabled Thomas to engage in [[hunting]], provided the castle with a supply of [[venison]] as well as generating income.<ref>Creighton, pp.190-1; Creighton and Higham, p.57.</ref> Most of the village of Wittenham had to be destroyed to make way for the park and the site eventually became a [[Deserted medieval village|deserted village]].<ref>Bettey, p.59.</ref> A new parish church, St Leonard's, was built by Thomas just outside the castle, after he had demolished the earlier, simpler 12th century church during the construction of the inner court.<ref>Kightly, pp.11, 18; Creighton, p.124; Miles and Saunders, p.167; Wilcox, p.87.</ref> Thomas died in 1397 and was buried in a new chapel, St Anne's, built on the north side of this church.<ref>Kightly, p.13.</ref>

[[Walter Hungerford, 1st Baron Hungerford|Sir Walter Hungerford]] inherited Farleigh Hungerford castle upon the death of his mother, Joan, in 1412.<ref>Kightly, p.18; Mackenzie, p.58.</ref> Walter's first political patron was John of Gaunt's son, [[Henry IV of England|Henry IV]], and later he became a close companion of Henry's own son, [[Henry V of England|Henry V]]; Henry V made Walter, like his father before him, the [[List of Speakers of the House of Commons of England|Speaker of the Commons]] in 1414.<ref name=KightlyP18>Kightly, p.18.</ref> Walter prospered: he became known as an expert [[jousting|jouster]], in 1415 fought at the [[battle of Agincourt]] during the [[Hundred Years War]], was made [[Steward of the Royal Household]] and was a major figure in government during the 1420s, serving as the [[Treasurer of England]] and as one of the legal guardians of the young [[Henry VI of England|Henry VI]].<ref>Kightly, p.19.</ref> Despite having to pay a ransom of <U+00A3>3,000 to the French after his son was captured in 1429, Walter, by now created [[Baron Hungerford]], amassed considerable wealth from his various sources of income, which included the right to one hundred [[Mark (money)|marks]] (<U+00A3>66) per year from the town of [[Marlborough]], the wool taxes from [[Wells]], and the ransoms gained from the taking of French prisoners.<ref>Kightly, p.20; Mackenzie, p.58.</ref>{{#tag:ref|Occasionally Sir Walter Hungerford is credited with constructing the outer court on the proceeds of taking [[Charles, Duke of Orl<U+00E9>ans|Charles]], the [[Duke of Orl<U+00E9>ans]], prisoner; both Canon Jackson and Charles Kightly dispute this, Jackson noting that it was Sir Richard Waller who took Charles prisoner at the battle.<ref>Jackson, p.116; Kightly, p.20.</ref>|group="nb"}}{{#tag:ref|It is impossible to accurately compare 15th century and modern prices or incomes.

Between 1430 and 1445 Walter expanded the castle considerably.<ref name=KightlyP18/> An outer court was built to the south side of the original castle, with its own towers and an additional gatehouse which formed the new entrance to the castle. These new defences were less strong than those of the original inner court, and indeed the eastern gatehouse was not [[battlement|crenellated]] at the time.<ref>Kightly, p.11; Pounds, p.266.</ref> A [[barbican]] was built, extending the older gatehouse to the inner court.<ref>Kightly, p.5.</ref> The new court enclosed the [[parish church]], which became the castle chapel, with a replacement church being built by Walter in the village.<ref>Kightly, p.12; Creighton, p.125.</ref> Walter had the chapel decorated with a number of [[mural]]s, depicting scenes from the story of [[Saint George and the Dragon]]; Saint George was a favoured saint of Henry V, and associated with the prestigious [[Order of the Garter]], of which Walter was a proud member.<ref>Kightly, pp.11, 21.</ref> A house was built next to the chapel for the use of the [[chantry]] priest.<ref name=KightlyP15>Kightly, p.15.</ref> Walter also legally combined the two parishes of [[Farleigh Hungerford|Farleigh]] in Somerset and Wittenham in [[Wiltshire]], which formed part of his castle's park, altering the county boundaries of Somerset and Wiltshire in the process. As a village, Wittenham disappeared completely.<ref>Creighton, p.191.</ref>

[[File:Farleigh Hungerford Castle Outer Court.jpg|thumb|left|View across the outer court, showing the south-west tower (l) and the chapel (r)]]
Walter left the castle to his son, [[Robert Hungerford, 2nd Baron Hungerford|Robert Hungerford]].<ref name=KightlyP22>Kightly, p.22.</ref> Records of the castle at the time show considerable luxuries, including valuable [[tapestry|tapestries]] up to {{convert|60|ft|m|1}} long, [[silk]] bedclothes, rich [[fur]]s and [[silver]] bowls and utensils.<ref>Kightly, p.6.</ref> Unfortunately, Robert's eldest son, the later [[Robert Hungerford, 3rd Baron Hungerford|Lord Moleyns]], was captured by the French at the [[battle of Castillon]], which was fought at the end of the Hundred Years War in 1453.<ref name=KightlyP22/> The huge ransom of over <U+00A3>10,000 required to ensure his release financially crippled the family, and Lord Moleyns did not return to England until 1459.<ref name=KightlyP22/>{{#tag:ref|It is impossible to accurately compare 14th century and modern prices or incomes. For comparison, <U+00A3>10,000 is almost as much as the <U+00A3>12,000 cost of building the major fortification of [[Bolton Castle]] during this period, although the latter was spread out over a twenty year period.<ref>Given-Wilson, p.157.</ref>|group="nb"}} By this time England had entered the period of civil conflict between the Houses of [[House of York|York]] and [[House of Lancaster|Lancaster]] known as the [[Wars of the Roses]]. Moleyns was a Lancastrian supporter and fought against the Yorkists in 1460 and 1461, leading to first his exile and then his [[attainder]], under which Farleigh Hungerford Castle was seized by the Crown.<ref name=KightlyP22/> Moleyns was captured and executed in 1464, and his eldest son, [[Thomas Hungerford of Rowden|Thomas]], met the same fate in 1469.<ref name=KightlyP22/>

The Yorkist [[Edward IV of England|Edward IV]] gave Farleigh Hungerford Castle to his brother [[Richard III of England|Richard]], then [[Duke of Gloucester]], in 1462.<ref name=KightlyP22/> Edward and Richard's brother [[George Plantagenet, 1st Duke of Clarence|George Plantagenet]] may have taken up residence at the castle; his daughter [[Margaret Pole, 8th Countess of Salisbury|Margaret]] was certainly born there.<ref>Murphy, p.5; Kightly, p.22.</ref> Richard became king in 1483 and gave the castle to [[John Howard, 1st Duke of Norfolk|John Howard]], the [[Duke of Norfolk]].<ref name=KightlyP22/> Meanwhile, the late Robert's youngest son, [[Walter Hungerford of Farleigh|Sir Walter]], had become a close supporter of Edward IV; nonetheless, he joined the failed revolt of 1483 against Richard and ended up detained in the [[Tower of London]].<ref>Kightly, p.22-3.</ref> When [[Henry VII of England|Henry Tudor]] invaded England in 1485, Walter escaped custody and joined the invading Lancastrian army, fighting alongside Henry at the [[Battle of Bosworth]].<ref name=KightlyP23>Kightly, p.23.</ref> Victorious, the newly crowned Henry VII returned Farleigh Hungerford to Walter in 1486.<ref name=KightlyP23/>

===16th century===

Sir Walter Hungerford died in 1516, leaving Farleigh Hungerford Castle to his son, Sir Edward.<ref name=KightlyP23/> Edward was a successful member of [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]]'s court and died in 1522, leaving the castle to his second wife, Agnes.<ref name=KightlyP23/> After Edward's death, however, it emerged that Agnes had been responsible for the murder of her former, first husband, John Cotell: two of her servants had strangled him at Farleigh Hungerford Castle, before burning his body in the castle oven to destroy any evidence.<ref name=KightlyP23/> Agnes appears to have been motivated by a desire for the wealth that would follow her second marriage to Sir Edward, but in 1523 Agnes and the two servants were hung for murder in London.<ref name=KightlyP23/>

Due to this execution, Edward's son, another [[Walter Hungerford, 1st Baron Hungerford of Heytesbury|Walter]], inherited the castle instead of Agnes.<ref name=KightlyP23/> Walter became a political client of [[Thomas Cromwell]], the powerful chief minister of Henry VIII, and operated on his behalf in the local region.<ref name=KightlyP23/> Walter became dissatisfied with his third wife, Elizabeth, after her father became a political liability to him, and Walter detained her in one of the castle towers for several years. Elizabeth complained that while she was imprisoned she was starved in an attempt to kill her, and subjected to several poisoning attempts.<ref name=KightlyP24>Kightly, p.24.</ref> She was probably kept in the north-west tower, although the south-west "Lady Tower" is named after her.<ref name=KightlyP24/> When Cromwell fell from power in 1540, so did Walter, who was executed for [[treason]], [[witchcraft]] and [[homosexuality]]: Elizabeth was allowed to remarry, but the castle reverted to the Crown.<ref name=KightlyP24/>

Walter's son, also called [[Walter Hungerford (Knight of Farley)|Walter]], bought back the castle from the Crown in 1554 for <U+00A3>5,000.<ref name=KightlyP25>Kightly, p.25.</ref>{{#tag:ref|It is difficult to accurately compare 16th century and modern prices or incomes. Depending on the measure used, <U+00A3>5,000 in 1554 could equate to either <U+00A3>1,180,000 (using the retail price index) or <U+00A3>18,900,000 (using the average earnings index). For comparison, <U+00A3>5,000 was around two and a half times the annual income of a wealthy knight like William Darrell who owned 25 manors.<ref>Financial comparison based on average earnings; using the [http://www.measuringworth.com/index.php Measuring Worth] website, accessed 1 August 2011; Hall, p.10.</ref>|group="nb"}} Farleigh Hungerford Castle and the surrounding park remained in good condition&nbsp;<U+2014> indeed, unusually for the time, the visiting [[antiquarian]] [[John Leland (antiquary)|John Leland]] was able to praise its "praty" (pretty) and "stately" condition&nbsp;<U+2014> but Walter continued to update the property, including adding more fashionable, Elizabethan style windows and improving the east range of the inner court, which became the main living area for the family.<ref>Kightly, pp.9, 25; Jackson, pp.115-6.</ref> Walter's second wife, [[Jane Dormer|Jane]], was a [[Roman Catholic]] and during the turbulent religious politics of the later Tudor period, their marriage collapsed, with Jane going into exile.<ref name=KightlyP25/> Walter and Jane's only son died young and, after the Walter's death in 1596, the castle passed to his brother, Sir Edward.<ref name=KightlyP26>Kightly, p.26.</ref>

===17th century===
[[File:Farleigh_Hungerford_Castle,_1730.jpg|thumb|300px|Water-colour of Farleigh Castle from the south-east, around 1730]]
Sir Edward Hungerford died in 1607, leaving Farleigh Hungerford Castle to his great-nephew, also called Sir [[Edward Hungerford (roundhead)|Edward Hungerford]].<ref name=KightlyP26/> Edward continued to modernise the castle, installing new windows in the medieval buildings of the inner court.<ref name=KightlyP26/> In 1642, however, [[English Civil War|civil war]] broke out in England between the supporters of [[Charles I of England|King Charles]] and [[Parliament]]. As a reformist [[Member of Parliament]] and a [[Puritan]], Edward was an active supporter of Parliamentary and volunteered himself as the leader of their forces in neighbouring [[Wiltshire]]; unfortunately this put him at odds with Sir [[Edward Bayntun]], another Wiltshire gentleman with similar ambitions.<ref>Kightly, p.26; Bull, pp.147-150.</ref> The resulting feud between the two men turned violent before Parliament finally settled the issue by appointing Hungerford as their leader in Wiltshire at the start of 1643.<ref>Bull, p.149.</ref> Edward's military record during the conflict was unexceptional: he abandoned several towns to advancing Royalist armies and fought on the losing side at the [[battle of Roundway Down]], although he did successfully seize [[Wardour Castle]] in 1643.<ref name=KightlyP26/>

Farleigh Hungerford Castle was captured by a Royalist unit in 1643 following a successful campaign by the King's forces across the south-west.<ref>Kightly, p.43.</ref> The castle was taken without a fight by Colonel John Hungerford, a half-brother of Edward, who installed a garrison that then supported itself by pillaging the surrounding countryside.<ref name=KightlyP27>Kightly, p.27.</ref> Several Parliamentary raids against Farleigh Hungerford were undertaken during 1644 but they failed to take back the castle.<ref name=KightlyP27/> By 1645, however, the Royalist cause was close to military collapse; Parliamentary forces began to mop-up the remaining Royalist garrisons in the south-west and on 15 September they reached the castle.<ref name=KightlyP27/> Colonel Hungerford immediately surrendered on good terms and Edward Hungerford peacefully reinstalled himself in the undamaged castle.<ref name=KightlyP27/> As a result of this process, the castle escaped being subsquently [[slighting|slighted]], or deliberately destroyed, by Parliament unlike many other castles in the region, such as [[Nunney Castle|Nunney]].<ref>Mackenzie, p.62.</ref>

[[File:Farleigh_Hungerford_Chapel_plan.jpg|thumb|left|170px|Plan of the chapel (l) and north chapel (r), around 1800]]
On Edward's death in 1648, [[Anthony Hungerford (Royalist)|Anthony Hungerford]], his half-brother, inherited the castle. The north chapel was extensively renovated during this period by Edward's widow, Margaret Hungerford, who covered the walls with pictures of [[saint]]s, [[cherub]]s, clouds, ribbons, crowns and [[heraldry]], as part of an elaborate tomb for her and Edward which cost <U+00A3>1,100 (<U+00A3>136,000 in 2009 terms).<ref>Kightly, pp.14-5.</ref> The renovation effectively blocked most of the access into the north chapel, making the new tomb the focus of attention for any visitor or religious activity.<ref>Roffey, pp.135-6.</ref> A number of [[lead]], anthropomorphic [[coffin]]s, some with moulded faces or death masks, were laid down in the crypt in the mid- to late-17th century.<ref name=KightlyP15/> Four men, two women and two children were embalmed in the castle in this way, probably including Edward and Margaret, as well as the final Sir Edward Hungerford, his wife, son and daughter-in-law.<ref name=KightlyP15/> Such lead coffins were extremely expensive during the period and reserved for the wealthiest in society.<ref name=TarlowP33>Tarlow, p.33.</ref> Originally the lead coffins would have been encased in wood, but this outer casing has since been lost.<ref name=TarlowP33/>

Anthony passed on both the castle and a considerable fortune to his son, Sir [[Edward Hungerford (Hungerford Market)|Edward Hungerford]], in 1657.<ref name=KightlyP27/> After his marriage, Edward enjoyed an income of around <U+00A3>8,000 a year (<U+00A3>1,110,000), making him a very wealthy man.<ref name=HaytonLancasterP437>Hayton and Lancaster, p.437.</ref> Edward lived a lavish lifestyle, however, including giving a huge gift of money to the exiled [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] shortly before his [[Restoration (1660)|restoration]] to the throne, and later entertaining the royal court at Farleigh Hungerford Castle in 1673.<ref name=KightlyP28>Kightly, p.28.</ref> Edward later fell out with the king over the proposal that the Catholic [[James II of England|James II]] should succeed to the throne on Charles' death, and after the discovery of the [[Rye House Plot]] in 1683 the castle was searched by royal officials looking for stocks of weapons that might be used in a possible revolt.<ref name=KightlyP28/>

Meanwhile, Edward had been living a truly extravagant lifestyle, including extensive [[gambling]], resulting in his running up debts of <U+00A3>40,000 (<U+00A3>5,540,000), and forcing him to sell off many of his estates in Wiltshire in 1683.<ref name=HaytonLancasterP437/> Over the next two years Edward incurred further debts of around <U+00A3>38,000 (<U+00A3>5,270,000) and was finally forced in 1686 to sell off the remaining lands in the south-west, including his castle, to Sir Henry Bayton, who purchased them for <U+00A3>56,000 (<U+00A3>7,750,000).<ref name=KightlyP29>Kightly, p.29.</ref> Henry lived in the castle until around the end of the century.<ref name=KightlyP29/>

From the 18th century onwards, Farleigh Hungerford Castle slipped into decline.<ref name=KightlyP29/> In 1702, the castle was sold on to Hector Cooper, who lived in [[Trowbridge]]; in 1730 it was passed in turn to the Houlton family, who had purchased the estates surrounding the castle.<ref>Jackson, pp.123-4.</ref> The Houlton family broke up castle's stone walls and the internal contents for salvage.<ref name=KightlyP29/> Some of the parts, such as the marble floors, were reused at [[Longleat]] or in the Houlton's new house, [[Farleigh House]], built nearby in the 1730s; other elements were reused by local villagers.<ref name=KightlyP29/> By the end of the 1730s the castle was ruinous and, although the castle chapel was repaired and brought back into use in 1779, the north-west and north-east towers had both collapsed by the end of 1797.<ref name=KightlyP30>Kightly, p.30.</ref> The outer court became a farm yard, with the priest's house becoming the farm house.<ref name=KightlyP30/> The castle's park was reassigned to serve Farleigh House instead.<ref name=KightlyP29/>{{#tag:ref|Kightly suggests that the castle was sold to the Houlton family in 1705, rather than 1730; Jackson disagrees.<ref>Jackson, pp.123-4.</ref>|group="nb"}}

Antiquarian curiosity in the castle had begun as early as 1700, when [[Peter Le Neve]] visited and recorded some of the architectural details, but interest increased in the 19th century.<ref>Jackson, p.117.</ref> This was partially due to the work of the local [[curate]], the Reverend J. Jackson, who undertook the first archaeological excavations at the site during the 1840s, uncovering many of the foundations of the inner court.<ref>Kightly, p.30; Jackson, p.117.</ref> 17th and 18th century [[stained glass]] windows from the continent were installed in the chapel, where the 15th century wall paintings were rediscovered in 1844.<ref>Jackson, p.120; Kightly, pp.12-3.</ref> The then owner, Colonel John Houlton, turned the chapel into a museum of curiosities, where for a small fee visitors could see sets of armour, what was said to be a pair of [[Oliver Cromwell]]'s boots and other English Civil War artefacts, including letters from Cromwell written to the Hungerfords.<ref>Kightly, p.30; Wade and Wade, p.134; Jackson, p.119.</ref>

The foundations that Jackson discovered during the excavations were left exposed for the benefit of visitors and larger numbers of tourists began to come to the castle to see the ruins, including [[Napoleon III|Louis-Napol<U+00E9>on Bonaparte]] in 1846.<ref name=KightlyP31>Kightly, p.31.</ref> The lead coffins in the chapel crypt were popular with tourists, although the coffins were extensively damaged by those visitors keen to see the contents inside.<ref name=KightlyP15/> The south-west tower, completely covered by thick [[ivy]], collapsed in 1842, after local children accidentally set fire to the vegetation that was, by then, holding the tower together.<ref>Jackson, p.117.</ref> [[Battlements]] were added to the east gatehouse during this period, transforming the appearance of its original [[gable]]d roof.<ref name=KightlyP11>Kightly, p.11.</ref>

In 1891, most of Farleigh Hungerford Castle was sold by the Houlton family to Lord Donington, who in turn sold it onto [[Wilfred Cairns, 4th Earl Cairns|Lord Cairns]] in 1907.<ref name=KightlyP31/> Cairns passed the castle to the [[Office of Works]] in 1915, by which time it was almost all heavily overgrown with ivy.<ref name=KightlyMilesP31>Kightly, p.31; Miles and Saunders, p.167.</ref> The Office of Works began a process of controversial restoration work, removing the ivy and repairing the stone work; the result was critiqued by H. Averay Tipping at the time as "giving the whole castle the effect of a new concrete building".<ref name=KightlyP31/> Further excavations took place in 1924 as part of the project, which retained the castle as a tourist attraction.<ref name=KightlyP31/> The last inhabitants of the farmhouse left in 1959, when the last parts of the outer court were sold to the government and restored.<ref name=KightlyMilesP31/> Attempts were made to preserve the wall paintings in the chapel during 1931 and 1955, but the treatments, which involved the use of red [[wax]], stained the paintings and caused considerable damage: the wax was removed in the 1970s.<ref>Kightly, p.13.</ref> Further excavations followed around the chapel and the priest's house in 1962 and 1968.<ref>Miles and Saunders, p.167.</ref> [[English Heritage]] took over responsibility for running the castle in 1983.<ref name=KightlyP31/>

===21st century===

Today, most of Farleigh Hungerford Castle is ruined. In the inner court only the exposed foundations remain of most of the castle buildings, along with the shells of the of the south-west and south-east towers.<ref name=PettiferP221>Pettifer, p.221.</ref> Unusually for English castles, the outer court has survived better than the inner.<ref name=PettiferP221/> The restored eastern gatehouse is carved with the badge of the Hungerfords and the initials of the first Sir Edward Hungerford, who had them carved there between 1516 and 1522.<ref name=KightlyP11/> The priest's house remains intact, measuring {{convert|39|ft|m|1}} by {{convert|22|ft|m|1}} with two rooms on the ground floor and four rooms above.<ref>''[http://webapp1.somerset.gov.uk/her/details.asp?prn=23883 Priest's house, Farleigh Castle, Farleigh Hungerford]'', Somerset Historic Environment Record, [[Somerset County Council]], accessed 2 August 2011.</ref>

In Saint Leonard's Chapel, the outlines of many of the medieval [[mural]]s can still be made out, with the [[Saint George and the Dragon (painting)|painting of Saint George and Dragon]] still in particularly good condition&nbsp;<U+2014> historian Simon Roffey describes this work, one of only four such surviving works in England, as "remarkable".<ref>Roffey, p.73; ''[http://www.pastscape.org/hob.aspx?hob_id=207732 Farleigh Castle Hungerford]'', National Monuments Record, [[English Heritage]], accessed 2 August 2011.</ref> The late 17th century tombs of the Hungerfords remain intact in the north chapel dedicated to Saint Anne. The surviving [[lead]] anthropomorphic coffins in the [[crypt]] are archaeologically significant: although numerous in the late 16th and 17th centuries, few lead coffins survive today and Farleigh Hungerford Castle has what historian Charles Kightly considers "the best collection" in the country.<ref name=KightlyP15/>

The castle site is run by [[English Heritage]] as a [[tourist attraction]]. It is a [[Scheduled Monument]] and a Grade I [[listed building]].<ref>''[http://homepage.mac.com/philipdavis/LOC/13831126.html Licence to crenellate Farleigh Hungerford Castle granted 1383&nbsp;Nov&nbsp;26]'', The Gatehouse, accessed 2 August 2011.</ref>
