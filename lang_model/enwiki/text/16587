'''''American Idiot''''' (also known as ''''''Green Day presents: American Idiot'''''')  is the seventh studio album by American [[punk rock]] band [[Green Day]], released on September 21, 2004 by [[Reprise Records]]. Co-produced with longterm collaborator [[Rob Cavallo]], ''American Idiot'' is a [[rock opera]] that criticized the contemporary political climate of the United States.

Following the 2003 recording of about 20 songs, later to become ''[[Cigarettes and Valentines]]'', Green Day spent three months recording new music. The first song, "[[American Idiot (song)|American Idiot]]", was followed by the recording of the two nine-minute songs on the album. The band decided to produce a [[concept album]], inspired by [[The Who]] and numerous musicals. Following early recording at [[Oakland, California]]'s Studio 880, the band finished the album in Los Angeles.

''American Idiot'' was a hit and achieved worldwide popularity, charting in 26 countries and hitting number one in nineteen of them, including the US and the United Kingdom. Since its release, ''American Idiot'' has sold over 15 million copies worldwide, including 267,000 in its opening week.<ref>Winwood, Ian. Kerrang! Interview.

Accessed July 28, 2008.</ref> The album won numerous awards including a [[Grammy Awards|Grammy]] for [[Grammy Award for Best Rock Album|Best Rock Album]], and received a positive reception from critics.

==Background and recording==
In mid-2003, Green Day convened at Studio 880 in [[Oakland, California]], and recorded about 20 songs for a new album titled ''[[Cigarettes and Valentines]]''.<ref name="combatrock">di Perna, Alan. "Combat Rock". ''Guitar World''. Holiday 2004.</ref><ref>Spitz, p. 152</ref> However, the master tracks went missing.<ref name="Spin">Pappademas, Alex. "Power to the People (With Funny Haircuts)". ''Spin''. November 2004.</ref> The band, wondering if it should re-record the songs, consulted with Rob Cavallo over what to do. Cavallo told the band members to ask themselves if the missing tracks represented their best work.<ref>Spitz, p. 153</ref> Guitarist [[Billie Joe Armstrong]] said the band members "couldn't honestly look at ourselves and say, 'That was the best thing we've ever done.' So we decided to move on and do something completely new."<ref name="combatrock" /> The band members agreed to spend the next three months writing new material.<ref>Spitz, p. 154</ref>

The first new song Green Day wrote was "[[American Idiot (song)|American Idiot]]". The band had difficulty following it up. One day, bassist [[Mike Dirnt]] was in the studio recording a 30-second song by himself. Armstrong decided he wanted to do the same, and drummer [[Tr<U+00E9> Cool]] followed suit. Armstrong recalled, "It started getting more serious as we tried to outdo one another. We kept connecting these little half-minute bits until we had something." This musical suite became "Homecoming", and the band subsequently wrote another suite, "[[Jesus of Suburbia]]". Armstrong was so emboldened by the creation of the two suites that he decided to make the record an album-long conceptual piece. The band took inspiration from concept records by [[The Who]], as well as musicals including ''[[West Side Story]]'' and ''[[Jesus Christ Superstar]]''.<ref name="combatrock" /> During their sessions at Studio 880, the members of Green Day spent their days writing material and would stay up late, drinking and discussing music. The band set up a pirate radio station from which it would broadcast jam sessions, along with occasional crank calls.<ref name="Spin" />

With demos completed, Green Day relocated to Los Angeles to continue work on the album.<ref>Spitz, p. 166</ref> The group first recorded at [[Ocean Way Recording]], then moved to Capitol Studios to complete the album.<ref name="combatrock" /> Armstrong said, "As a songwriter, I get so deep into what I'm writing about, it's almost like I have to stir up shit to write about it." The band admitted to partying during the L.A. sessions; Armstrong had to schedule vocal recording sessions around his hangovers. Armstrong described the environment, "For the first time, we separated from our pasts, from how we were ''supposed'' to behave as Green Day. For the first time, we fully accepted the fact that we're rock stars."<ref name="Spin" />

==Music==
''American Idiot'' is a concept album that tells the story of a central character named Jesus of Suburbia. The album was a departure from Green Day's typical way of writing music. Armstrong said, "As soon as you abandon the verse-chorus-verse-chorus-bridge [song] structure . . . it opens up your mind to this different way of writing, where there really are no rules." Armstrong said the band aimed to be ambitious, which he felt many contemporary rock bands were not.<ref name="combatrock" />

The band favored loud guitar sounds for the record; Armstrong said "we were like, 'Let's just go balls-out on the guitar sound--plug in the [[Gibson Les Paul|Les Pauls]] and [[Marshall Amplification|Marshalls]] and let it rip'". The guitarist played more lead guitar on the album than he had on any previous release, which he said he previously shied away from for fear of sounding "corny". Armstrong added tracks of acoustic guitar-playing throughout the record to augment his electric guitar rhythms and Cool's drumming, creating a percussive sound.<ref name="combatrock" />

===Story===
The album's protagonist, Jesus of Suburbia, emerged out of Armstrong asking himself what sort of person the title of "American Idiot" referred to. Armstong described the character as essentially an anti-hero, a powerless "everyman" desensitized by a "steady diet of soda pop and Ritalin".<ref name="combatrock" /> Jesus of Suburbia hates his town and those close to him, so he leaves for the city.<ref>Spitz, p. 165</ref> As the album progresses the characters St. Jimmy and Whatsername are introduced. St. Jimmy is punk rock freedom fighter. Whatsername, inspired by the [[Bikini Kill]] song "Rebel Girl", is a "Mother Revolution" figure that Armstrong described as "kind of St. Jimmy's nemesis in a lot of ways". Both characters illustrate the "rage vs. love" theme of the album, in that "you can go with the blind rebellion of self-destruction, where Saint Jimmy is. But there's a more love-driven side to that, which is following your beliefs and ethics. And that's where Jesus of Suburbia really wants to go", according to Armstrong. Near the end of the story, St. Jimmy apparently commits suicide. While the singer did not want to give away the details of the story's resolution, he said the intention is for the listener to ultimately realize that Jesus of Suburbia is really St. Jimmy, and Jimmy is "part of the main character that pretty much dies". In the album final song, "Whatsername", Jesus of Suburbia loses his connection with Whatsername as well.<ref name="combatrock" />

==Release and reception==
''American Idiot'' would continue Green Day's commercial success thanks to the second single "[[Boulevard of Broken Dreams (Green Day song)|Boulevard of Broken Dreams]]" which peaked at the number one on the Modern and Mainstrean Rock Tracks. Upon its release in September 2004, ''American Idiot'' peaked at #1 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] album chart. The album granted Green Day international recognition. ''American Idiot'' achieved five times Platinum status in the United States, eight times platinum status in Canada and six times platinum status in the United Kingdom.

''American Idiot'' included the hit singles "[[American Idiot (song)|American Idiot]]", "[[Boulevard of Broken Dreams (Green Day song)|Boulevard of Broken Dreams]]", "[[Holiday (Green Day song)|Holiday]]", "[[Wake Me Up When September Ends]]" and "[[Jesus of Suburbia]]", all of which had accompanying [[music video]]s. All the singles charted on the ''Billboard'' [[Modern Rock Tracks]]. "Boulevard of Broken Dreams" was the most successful song from ''American Idiot'' on the rock charts, reaching number 1 on the Mainstream Rock Charts and number 1 on the Modern Rock Tracks. "Boulevard of Broken Dreams" arguably became Green Day's most recognizable and popular song. Its music video received heavy airplay on music television.

[[Allmusic]] praised the album from both perspectives; either as "a collection of great songs", or as a whole.<ref>[[Stephen Thomas Erlewine]]. [http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=10:b7rvad4kw8wj~T1 American Idiot > Overview]. [[Allmusic]]. Accessed July 23, 2008.</ref> [[Pitchfork Media]] said the "ambitious" album was successful in getting across its message, and "keeps its mood and method deliberately, tenaciously, and angrily on point".<ref>Johnny Loftus (September 24, 2004). [http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/article/record_review/18208/Green_Day_American_Idiot American Idiot - Green Day]. [[Pitchfork Media]]. Accessed July 23, 2008.</ref> ''[[Uncut (magazine)|Uncut]]'' wrote that although the album was heavily politically focused, "slam-dancing is still possible", in a moderate review,<ref>[http://www.uncut.co.uk/music/green_day/reviews/8453 Green Day - American Idiot]. ''[[Uncut (magazine)|Uncut]]''. Accessed July 23, 2008.</ref> while ''[[The New York Times]]'' praised Green Day for trumping "any pretension with melody and sheer fervor".<ref>Jon Pareles (September 26, 2004). [http://www.nytimes.com/2004/09/26/arts/music/26PLAY.html Putting Her Money Where Her Music Video Is]. ''[[The New York Times]]''. Accessed July 23, 2008.</ref>

''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' said that despite being based on a musical theatre concept "that periodically makes no sense", Green Day "make the journey entertaining enough". It described most of the songs as forgettable, though, arguing the album focuses more on lyrics than music.<ref>[[David Browne]] (September 24, 2004). [http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,697504,00.html American Idiot]. ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]''. Accessed July 23, 2008.</ref> [[Robert Christgau]]'s C+ said the album featured "emotional travails of two clueless punks" using "devices that sunk under their own weight back when [[The Who]] invented them",<ref>[[Robert Christgau]]. [http://www.robertchristgau.com/get_artist.php?id=540&name=Green+Day Green Day reviews]. Accessed July 23, 2008.</ref> and ''[[The Guardian]]'' called ''American Idiot'' a mess<U+2014>"but a vivid, splashy, even courageous mess".<ref>Dorian Lynskey (September 17, 2004). [http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2004/sep/17/popandrock.shopping2 Green Day, American Idiot]. ''[[The Guardian]]''. Accessed July 23, 2008.</ref> ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' said the album could have been, and was, a mess, but that the "individual tunes are tough and punchy enough to work on their own".<ref>[[Rob Sheffield]] (September 30, 2004). [http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/greenday/albums/album/6489114/review/6477969 Green Day: American Idiot]. ''[[Rolling Stone]]''. Accessed July 23, 2008.</ref>

In 2005, ''American Idiot'' won a [[Grammy Award|Grammy]] for [[Grammy Award for Best Rock Album|Best Rock Album]] and was nominated in four other categories including [[Grammy Award for Album of the Year|Album of the Year]]. The album helped Green Day win seven of the eight awards they were nominated for at the 2005 [[MTV Video Music Awards]]; the "Boulevard of Broken Dreams" video won six of those awards. A year later, "Boulevard of Broken Dreams" won a [[48th Grammy Awards|Grammy]] for [[Grammy Award for Record of the Year|Record of the Year]].

==Legacy==
In late 2005, Dean Gray released a [[Mashup (music)|mash-up]] version of the album<U+2014>called ''[[American Edit]]''<U+2014>and became a [[cause c<U+00E9>l<U+00E8>bre]] when the artist was served with a [[cease and desist]] order by Green Day's record label. Tracks include "Dr. Who on Holiday" and "Boulevard of Broken Songs". Billie Joe Armstrong later stated that he heard one of the songs on the radio and enjoyed it.<ref>James Montgomery (December 20, 2005). [http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1518595/20051220/green_day.jhtml Green Day Mash-Up Leads to Cease and Desist Order]. [[MTV]]. Accessed July 29, 2008.</ref>

==Movie adaptation==
Shortly after the album was released there was speculation that ''American Idiot'' might be made into a movie. [[VH1]] quoted Armstrong as saying "We've definitely been talking about someone writing a script for it, and there's been a few different names that have been thrown at us. It sounds really exciting, but for right now it's just talk."<Ref>Corey Moss (September 21, 2004) [http://www.vh1.com/news/articles/1491274/20040921/green_day.jhtml Green Day COnsidering Movie Version of American Idiot]. [[VH1]]. Accessed August 3, 2008.</ref> Armstrong later stated that shooting would begin for ''American Idiot: The Motion Picture'' in 2006, stressing, "We want to see how it turns out first so that it doesn't suck."<ref>[http://movie.monstersandcritics.com/news/article_6004.php/Green_Day_Hit_The_Big_Screen]</ref> On June 1, 2006 Armstrong announced in an interview with MTV.com that "it's definitely unfolding" and that "every single week there's more ideas about doing a film for ''American Idiot'', and it's definitely going to happen,"<ref>[http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1533255/20060531/index.jhtml?headlines=true Green Day Promise Next LP Will Be 'An Event' - News Story | Music, Celebrity, Artist News | MTV News<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> but the band later said, "It is gonna take a little while." Armstrong mentioned that this project is currently on hold to work on their music. So whether or not this movie will ever actually be finished is unknown.<ref>[http://www.greendayauthority.com/projects.php GDA | Current GD Projects<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>
