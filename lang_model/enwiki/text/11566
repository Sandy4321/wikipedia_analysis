{{Politics of South Africa}}
The '''Constitution of South Africa''' is the supreme [[law]] of the country of [[South Africa]]. It provides the legal foundation for the existence of the Republic of South Africa, sets out the rights and duties of the citizens of South Africa, and defines the structure of the [[Government of South Africa]]. The current Constitution of South Africa was adopted by the Constitutional Assembly on 11 October 1996, certified by the [[Constitutional Court of South Africa|Constitutional Court]] on 4 December, signed by [[President of South Africa|President]] [[Nelson Mandela]] on 10 December, and came into effect on 4 February 1997, replacing and repealing the Interim Constitution of 1993. Since its adoption, the Constitution has been amended sixteen times.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.constitutionalcourt.org.za/site/theconstitution/thecertificationprocess.htm |title=The Constitution: The certification process |publisher=Constitutional Court of South Africa |accessdate=13 October 2009}}</ref>

The Constitution is formally an [[Act of Parliament|Act]] of the [[Parliament of South Africa]]; its [[short title]] is '''Constitution of the Republic of South Africa, 1996''' and its [[long title]] is "An Act to introduce a new Constitution for the Republic of South Africa and to provide for matters incidental thereto"<ref>{{cite journal |date=18 December 1996|title=Constitution of the Republic of South Africa, 1996 |journal=Government Gazette of South Africa |volume=378 |issue=17678 |location=Cape Town |url=http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Constitution_of_the_Republic_of_South_Africa_1996_from_Government_Gazette.djvu}}</ref>. It was formerly also numbered as '''Act No. 108 of 1996''', but since the passage of the [[Citation of Constitutional Laws Act|Citation of Constitutional Laws Act, 2005]] it has had no associated Act number.<ref>{{cite journal |date=27 June 2005|title=Citation of Constitutional Laws Act, 2005 |journal=Government Gazette of South Africa |volume=480 |issue=27722 |location=Cape Town |url=http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Citation_of_Constitutional_Laws_Act_2005_from_Government_Gazette.djvu}}</ref>

==History==
The South African [[Constitutional Court of South Africa|Constitutional Court]] played an important role in the adoption of the 1996 Constitution. In terms of the interim constitution, the [[Parliament of South Africa|Parliament]] sitting as the Constitutional Assembly was required to produce a new constitution. In turn, the court was required to certify that the new constitution complied with the 34 constitutional principles agreed upon in advance by the negotiators of the Interim Constitution. The court ruled that the constitutional text adopted by the Constitutional Assembly in May 1996 could not be certified. The court identified the features of the new text that did not in its view comply with the Constitutional Principles and gave its reasons for that view. The Constitutional Assembly then had to reconsider the text, taking the court<U+2019>s reasons for non-certification into account. 

The Constitutional Assembly reconvened and on 11 October 1996, it adopted an amended constitutional text containing many changes from the previous text, some dealing with the court<U+2019>s reasons for non-certification and others tightening up the text. The amended text was then sent to the Constitutional Court for certification. In its judgement in the ''Certification of the Amended Text of the Constitution of the Republic of South Africa, 1996'' (4 December 1996) the court held that all of the grounds for non-certification of the earlier text had been eliminated in the new draft and accordingly certified that the text complied with the requirements of the Constitutional Principles. The text duly became the Constitution of the Republic of South Africa in 1996 and came into effect in February 1997. It has been amended sixteen times since its adoption. On 8 May 2006 the tenth anniversary of the adoption of the constitution was celebrated in Parliament.

== Features ==
The constitution consists of a preamble, fourteen chapters followed by seven schedules. Each chapter and schedule focus on a specific topic. The following is a list of chapters and schedules and the focus of each.

=== Chapters ===
'''Chapter 1''' of the Constitution is entitled "Founding Provisions."  It enshrines in the constitution key national [[principle]]s, identifies the [[flag of South Africa]] and lists the [[official language]]s. By virtue of section 2 of chapter 1, all statutes that conflict with the Constitution are of no force or effect.

South Africa is defined in this chapter as being a [[democracy|democratic]], independent [[republic]] based upon the principles of protecting [[dignity]], [[human rights]] and the [[rule of law]]. Values of dignity and human rights are repeated in [[Constitution of South Africa Chapter 2: Bill of Rights|Chapter 2]]. 

The official languages are identified by section 6 as being [[Northern Sotho language|Sepedi]], [[Sesotho]], [[Setswana]], [[siSwati]], [[Tshivenda]], [[Xitsonga]], [[Afrikaans]], [[English language|English]], [[isiNdebele]], [[isiXhosa]] and [[isiZulu]]. The government of South Africa is also required to promote usage of native languages. Choice of language by national or municipal government should take into consideration the most relevant language to the area affected. Section 6 also requires that a [[Pan South African Language Board]] must advance the use of all official languages, and to respect the citizens' use of other languages such as [[German language|German]] or [[Urdu]].

<nowiki>*</nowiki> The Citation of Constitutional Laws Act, No. 5 of 1999 provides that the Constitution of the Republic of South Africa, 1996 and Acts which amend it, are not to be associated with Act numbers. It is possible that Act 5 of 1999 itself can be considered an amendment of the Constitution of the Republic of South Africa, 1996, but it makes no provision for itself to be referred to without reference to it Act number.{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}}
