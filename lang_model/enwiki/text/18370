The '''machair''' ({{IPA-gd|<U+02C8>max<U+026A><U+027E><U+02B2>}}; sometimes '''machar''' in English) refers to a fertile low-lying grassy [[plain]] found on some of the north-west [[coastline]]s of [[Ireland]] and [[Scotland]], in particular the [[Outer Hebrides]]. Two distinct types exist:
* A type of [[Dune|sand-dune]] [[pasture]], subject to [[agricultural]] cultivation, which prevails in wet and windy conditions;
* The land between a [[beach]] and the area where sand encroaches on [[Bog|peat bog]]s further inland.

==Geology==
In both cases, a machair is a former [[beach]], left higher in elevation than the current adjacent beach following a drop in [[sea level]] or [[isostasy]].

Machairs largely owe their fertility to the fact their sand has a high [[animal shell|seashell]] content- sometimes as high as 90%. This sand is blown inland, acts to neutralize the acidity of the peatbogs and results in the fertility of the grassland.

==Ecology==
Machairs have received considerable [[ecological]] and [[conservation biology|conservational]] attention, chiefly because of their unique [[ecosystem]]s. They can house [[rare species|rare]] [[carpet flower]]s, such as [[Spiranthes|Irish Lady's Tresses]], [[Orchidaceae|orchids]] and [[Yellow Rattle]],<ref>[http://www.wildlifehebrides.com/environment/machair/ Machair Profile]</ref> along with a diverse array of bird species including the [[Corn Crake]], [[Twite]], [[Dunlin]], [[Common Redshank]] and [[Ringed Plover]], as well as rare insects such as the [[northern colletes]] bee. Some machairs are threatened by [[erosion]] caused by rising sea levels as well as by recreational use of vicinity beaches.
