Opened in 1966 it became the fourth Metro system in the former [[Soviet Union]]. Like most ex-Soviet Metros, most of the stations are very deep and vividly decorated.

==Operation==
[[Image:Tbilisi Metro Isani station.JPG|thumb|Isani Metro Station]]
Presentely the system consists of 2 lines, 22 stations on 26.4 kilometres of track. 20 stations are below ground and two are surface level. Of the subterranial stations 16 are deep level and 4 shallow. The former compomise 6 pylon stations, 5 column and 5 single vaults (built to the [[Saint Petersburg Metro|Leningrad]] Technology). The shallow stations consist of three pillar-trispans and one single vault ([[Kharkiv Metro|Kharkov]] Technology). Due to Tbilisi's uneven landscape, the metro, particularly the Gldani-Varketili line, in three cases goes above ground. 

In 2005 it was estimated that a total of 105.6 million people used the Metro annually<ref>[http://www.statistics.ge/index_eng.htm State Department of Statistics of Georgia]</ref>. Carrying them are a fleet of 186 metro cars from two depots. Although the platforms are accommodated for five-carriage trains currentely 4 and 3 carriage trains are used on lines 1 and 2 respectfully. The car models are identical to those of other ex-Soviet Metros. The cost per token is 20 [[tetri]]s, and remains valid for the whole duration. Trains run from 6:00 am till 1:00 am with intervals ranging betwenn 4 minutes and 2.5 during peak times.

==History==
[[Tbilisi]] (officially known as Tiflis until [[1936]]), capital of Georgia, was always considered to be the fourth city of the Soviet Union, particularly of its political position as being the capital of the republic ([[Georgian SSR]]) from which many of the top Soviet politicians came from (notably [[Joseph Stalin]]). Also the city grew quite rapidly during the 19th and 20th century and apart from being a cultural centre and a political one was also an important transport hub in [[South Caucasus|Transcaucasia]] and an industrial centre as well. All this amounted to the need of a [[rapid transit]] Metro system. 

Construction began in [[1952]], and on [[11 January]], [[1966]], the Tbilisi Metro was triumphately opened becoming the first and by far the only Metro system in Georgia and the fourth one in the former [[Soviet Union]] (after [[Moscow]], [[Saint Petersburg]], and [[Kiev]]), when the first six stations were opened. Since then the system has steadily grown to a two line 22 station network.  

During the [[1990s]], most of the Soviet-era station names were changed, although the financial difficulties since the breakup of the Soviet Union hit the Metro particularly hard in its infrastructure, operations and extensions. Until recently, the Metro had been underfund and operated in severe difficulties due to poor electrical supply. It had also become infamous for widespread petty crime, like pickpocketing and mugging. In addition, there have been several incidents at metro stations in recent years. On [[October 9]], [[1997]], a former [[policeman]] blew himself up at [[Didube metro station, Tbilisi|Didube station]]. On [[February 14]], [[2000]], a teenager threw a homemade [[hand grenade]] into a metro station, injuring several people. In [[March 2004]], several people were poisoned by an unidentified gas while using the Metro.

However, the crime has reduced as a result of security and administration reforms in the system from 2004 to 2005. Other services have also significantly improved. 

Currently, the Tbilisi Metro system is undergoing a major rehabilitation process including the reconstruction of the stations as well as modernization of trains and other facilities. The city's 2006 budget allocated 16 million [[Georgian lari|lari]] for this project. [[President of Georgia]], [[Mikhail Saakashvili]], promised to make the Metro most prestigious public transport and charged Director General of Tbilisi Metro, Zurab Kikalishvili, in late 2005, to bring the metro to [[Europe]]an standards by 2007<ref>[http://eng.primenewsonline.com/?c=124&a=3647 Primes News agency]</ref>

==Future==
The system has also an advanced extension plan, with a third line, amongst other locations, encompass the historic district of [[Vake]]. Forming a typical Soviet triangle with three-line six radii layout intersecting in the city centre. However, most of the construction sites remain frozen, some dating to the Soviet times.
