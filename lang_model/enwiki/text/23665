'''Wilfrid''' (originally spelled '''Wilfrith''')<ref name=Fraser47>Fraser ''From Caledonia to Pictland'' p. 47</ref> (''[[circa|c]]''. 633 <U+2013> ''c''. 709) was an English [[bishop]] and [[saint]]. Born a [[Northumbria]]n noble, he entered the religious life as a teenager and studied at [[Lindisfarne]], at Canterbury, in [[Gaul]], and at Rome; he returned to Northumbria in about 660, and became the abbot of a newly founded monastery at [[Ripon]]. In 664 Wilfrid acted as spokesman for the Roman "party" at the [[Synod of Whitby|Council of Whitby]], and became famous for his speech advocating that the Roman method for calculating the date of Easter should be adopted. His success prompted the king's son, Alhfrith, to appoint him Bishop of Northumbria. Wilfrid chose to be consecrated in Gaul because of the lack of what he considered to be validly consecrated bishops in England at that time. During Wilfrid's absence Alhfrith seems to have led an unsuccessful revolt against his father, [[Oswiu of Northumbria|Oswiu]], leaving a question mark over Wilfrid's appointment as bishop. Before Wilfrid's return Oswiu had appointed [[Saint Chad|Ceadda]] in his place, resulting in Wilfrid's retirement to Ripon for a few years following his arrival back in Northumbria.

After becoming Archbishop of Canterbury in 668, [[Theodore of Tarsus]] resolved the situation by deposing Ceadda and restoring Wilfrid as the Bishop of Northumbria. For the next nine years Wilfrid discharged his episcopal duties, founded monasteries, built churches, and improved the [[liturgy]]. However his [[diocese]] was very large, and Theodore wished to reform the English Church, a process which included breaking up some of the larger dioceses into smaller ones. When Wilfrid quarrelled with Ecgfrith, the Northumbrian king, Theodore took the opportunity to implement his reforms despite Wilfrid's objections. After Ecgfrith expelled him from York, Wilfrid travelled to Rome to appeal to the papacy. Pope [[Pope Agatho|Agatho]] ruled in Wilfrid's favour, but Ecgfrith refused to honour the papal decree and instead imprisoned Wilfrid on his return to Northumbria before exiling him.

Wilfrid spent the next few years in [[Selsey]], where he founded an [[episcopal see]] and converted the pagan inhabitants of the [[Kingdom of Sussex]] to Christianity. Theodore and Wilfrid settled their differences, and Theodore urged the new Northumbrian king, [[Aldfrith of Northumbria|Aldfrith]], to allow Wilfrid's return. Aldfrith agreed to do so, but in 691 he expelled Wilfrid again. Wilfrid went to Mercia, where he helped missionaries and acted as bishop for the Mercian king. Wilfrid appealed to the papacy about his expulsion in 700, and the pope ordered that an English council should be held to decide the issue. This council, held at Austerfield in 702, attempted to confiscate all of Wilfrid's possessions, and so Wilfrid travelled to Rome to appeal against the decision. His opponents in Northumbria excommunicated him, but the papacy upheld Wilfrid's side, and he regained possession of Ripon and Hexham, his Northumbrian monasteries. Wilfrid died in 709 or 710. After his death, he was venerated as a saint.

Historians then and now have been divided over Wilfrid. His followers commissioned [[Stephen of Ripon]] to write a ''[[Vita Sancti Wilfrithi|Life of Wilfrid]]'' shortly after his death, and the great medieval historian Bede also wrote extensively about him. Wilfrid lived ostentatiously, and travelled with a large retinue. He ruled a large number of monasteries, and claimed to be the first Englishman to introduce the ''Rule of Saint Benedict'' into English monasteries. Some modern historians see him mainly as a champion of Roman customs against the customs of the [[Celtic Christianity|British and Irish churches]], others as an advocate for [[monasticism]].

==Background==
[[Image:British seventh century kingdoms.gif|thumb|left|upright|300px|Anglo-Saxon kingdoms in the late 7th century|alt=Map of the island of Great Britain. At the far north are the Picts, then below them Strathclyde and Northumbria. In the middle western section are Gwynedd, Powys, Dyfedd, and Gwent. Along the southern shore are Dumnonia, the West and South Saxons, and Kent, running from west to east. In the center of the island is Mercia. Along the eastern central coast are the East Angles and Lindsey.]]

{{main|Heptarchy}}

During Wilfrid's lifetime the British Isles consisted of a number of small kingdoms. Traditionally the [[English people]] were thought to have been divided into seven kingdoms, but modern historiography has shown that this is a simplification of a much more confused situation.<ref name=Hept>Keynes "Heptarchy" ''Blackwell Encyclopedia of Anglo-Saxon England''</ref> A late 7th-century source, the [[Tribal Hidage]], lists the peoples south of the Humber river; among the largest groups of peoples are the West Saxons (later [[Wessex]]), the [[Kingdom of the East Angles|East Angles]] and [[Mercia]]ns (later the Kingdom of Mercia), and the [[Kingdom of Kent]]. Smaller groups who at that time had their own royalty but were later were absorbed into larger kingdoms include the peoples of [[Magons<U+00E6>te]], Lindsey, [[Hwicce]], the [[Kingdom of Essex|East Saxons]], the South Saxons,<ref name=Kings9/> the Isle of Wight, and the [[Middle Angles]].<ref name=Earliest5>Kirby ''Earliest English Kings'' pp. 5<U+2013>7</ref> Other even smaller groups had their own rulers, but their size means that they do not often appear in the histories.<ref name=Kings9>Yorke ''Kings and Kingdoms'' pp. 9<U+2013>11</ref> There were also native Britons in the west, in modern-day [[Wales]] and [[Cornwall]], who formed kingdoms including those of [[Dumnonia]], [[Kingdom of Dyfed|Dyfed]], and [[Kingdom of Gwynedd|Gwynedd]].<ref name=Conv37>Yorke ''Conversion'' p. 37</ref>

Between the Humber and [[Firth of Forth|Forth]] the English had formed into two main kingdoms, [[Deira]] and Bernicia, often united as the Kingdom of Northumbria.<ref name=Kings74>Yorke ''Kings and Kingdoms'' p. 74</ref> A number of Celtic kingdoms also existed in this region, including [[Craven]], [[Elmet]], [[Rheged]], and [[Gododdin]]. A native British kingdom, later called the [[Kingdom of Strathclyde]], survived as an independent power into the 10th century in the area which became modern-day [[Dunbartonshire]] and [[Clydesdale]].<ref name=Conv38>Yorke ''Conversion'' p. 38</ref> To the north-west of Strathclyde lay the Gaelic kingdom of [[D<U+00E1>l Riata]], and to the north-east a small number of Pictish kingdoms.<ref name=Kings83>Yorke ''Kings and Kingdoms'' pp. 83<U+2013>86</ref> Further north still lay the great Pictish kingdom of [[Fortriu]], which after the [[Battle of Dunnichen]] in 685 came to be the strongest power in the northern half of Britain.<ref>Charles-Edwards "'The Continuation of Bede" ''Seanchas'' pp. 137<U+2013>145</ref><ref>Woolf "Dun Nechtain" ''Scottish Historical Review'' pp. 182<U+2013>201</ref><ref>Woolf "The Verturian hegemony" ''Mercia'' pp. 106<U+2013>112</ref>

Christianity had only recently arrived in some of these kingdoms.<ref name=Earliest2>Kirby ''Earliest English Kings'' p. 2</ref> Some had been converted by the [[Gregorian mission]], a group of Roman missionaries who arrived in Kent in 597 and who mainly influenced southern Britain. Others had been converted by the Hiberno-Scottish mission, chiefly Irish missionaries working in Northumbria and neighbouring kingdoms.<ref name=Conv123>Yorke ''Conversion'' pp. 123<U+2013>124</ref> A few kingdoms, such as D<U+00E1>l Riata, became Christian but how they did so is unknown.<ref name=Conv114>Yorke ''Conversion'' pp. 114<U+2013>115</ref> The native Picts, according to the medieval writer Bede, were converted in two stages, initially by native Britons under [[Saint Ninian|Ninian]], and subsequently by Irish missionaries.<ref name=Conv128>Yorke ''Conversion'' pp. 128<U+2013>129</ref>

===Sources===
The main sources for knowledge of Wilfrid are the medieval ''Life of Wilfrid'', written by Stephen of Ripon soon after Wilfrid's death, and the works of the medieval historian Bede, who knew Wilfrid during the bishop's lifetime.<ref name=DNB/><ref name=World151>Blair ''World of Bede'' p. 151</ref> Stephen's ''Life'' is a hagiography, intended to show Wilfrid as a saintly man, and to buttress claims that he was a saint.<ref name=Goffart285>Goffart ''Narrators of Barbarian History'' pp. 285<U+2013>286</ref><ref name=Dict146>Coredon ''Dictionary of Medieval Terms and Phrases'' p. 146</ref> The ''Life'' is selective in its coverage, and gives short shrift to Wilfrid's activities outside of Northumbria. Two-thirds of the work deals with Wilfrid's attempts to return to Northumbria, and a defence and vindication of his Northumbrian career.<ref name=Goffart285/> Stephen's work is flattering and highly favourable to Wilfrid, making its use as a source problematic;<ref name=Brown28/> despite its shortcomings however, the ''Life'' is the main source of information on Wilfrid's life.<ref name=Laynes163>Laynesmith "Stephen of Ripon" ''Early Medieval Europe'' p. 163</ref><ref name=Barbarian175/> It views the events in Northumbria in the light of Wilfrid's reputation and from his point of view, and is highly partisan.<ref name=Fraser266>Fraser ''From Caledonia to Pictland'' pp. 266<U+2013>267</ref> Another concern is that hagiographies were usually full of conventional material, often repeated from earlier saints' lives,<ref name=Intro322>Blair ''Introduction to Anglo-Saxon England'' p. 322</ref> as was the case with Stephen's work.<ref name=Saints137>Heffernan ''Sacred Biography'' pp. 137<U+2013>142</ref> It appears that the ''Life of Wilfrid'' was not well known in the Middle Ages, as only two manuscripts of the work survive.<ref name=Reread96>Higham ''(Re-)reading Bede'' pp. 98 and 237 footnote 200</ref>

Bede also covers Wilfrid's life in his ''Historia ecclesiastica gentis Anglorum'', but his account is more measured and restrained.<ref name=Brown28>Brown "Royal and Ecclesiastical" ''Renascence'' p. 28</ref> In the ''Historia'', Bede used Stephen's ''Life'' as a source, reworking the information and adding new material when possible. Other, more minor, sources for Wilfrid's life include a mention of Wilfrid in one of Bede's letters.<ref name=Goffart322>Goffart ''Narrators of Barbarian History'' p. 322</ref> A poetical ''Life of Wilfrid'' by [[Frithegod]] written in the 10th century is essentially a rewrite of Stephen's ''Life'', produced in celebration of the movement of Wilfrid's [[relic]]s to Canterbury.<ref name=DNB/> Wilfrid is also mentioned in the ''[[Anglo-Saxon Chronicle]]'',<ref name=ASC>Under the years 656, 661, 664, 675, 678, 685, 709, and 710. See the index to Swanton's ''Anglo-Saxon Chronicle''</ref> but as the Chronicle was probably a 9th-century compilation, the material on Wilfrid may ultimately have derived either from Stephen's ''Life'' or from Bede.<ref name=ASCxviii>Swanton "Introduction" ''Anglo-Saxon Chronicle'' pp. xviii<U+2013>xix</ref> Another, later, source was the ''Life of Wilfrid'' written by [[Eadmer]], a 12th-century Anglo-Norman writer and monk from Canterbury. This source is higly influenced by the contemporary concerns of its writer, but does attempt to provide some new material besides reworking Bede.<ref name=Philpott101/>

Many historians, including the editor of Bede's works, [[Charles Plummer]], have seen in Bede's writings a dislike of Wilfrid. The historian Walter Goffart goes further, suggesting that Bede wrote his ''Historia'' as a reaction to Stephen's ''Life of Wilfrid'', and that Stephen's work was written as part of a propaganda campaign to defend a "Wilfridian" party in Northumbrian politics.<ref name=Reread58/> Some historians, including [[James E. Fraser (historian)|James Fraser]], find that a credible view,<ref name=Fraser266/> but others such as Nick Higham are less convinced of Bede's hostility to Wilfrid.<ref name=Reread58>Higham ''(Re-)reading Bede'' pp. 58<U+2013>63</ref>

==Early life==
===Childhood and early education===
Wilfrid was born in Northumbria in about 633.<ref name=Harting107>Mayr-Harting ''Coming of Christianity'' p. 107<U+2013>112</ref> The historian James Fraser argues that Wilfrid's family were aristocrats from Deira, pointing out that most of Wilfrid's early contacts were from that area.<ref name=Fraser190>Fraser ''Caledonia to Pictland'' pp. 190<U+2013>191</ref> A conflict with his stepmother when he was about 14 years old drove Wilfrid to leave home, probably without his father's consent.<ref name=Hindley78>Hindley ''A Brief History of the Anglo-Saxons'' pp. 78<U+2013>83</ref> Wilfrid's background is never explicitly described as noble, but the king's retainers were frequent guests at his father's house, and on leaving home Wilfrid equipped his party with horses and clothes fit for a royal court.<ref name=Barbarian175/>

Queen [[Eanfl<U+00E6>d]] became Wilfrid's patroness following his arrival at the court of her husband, King Oswiu.<ref name=Hindley78/> She sent him to study under Cudda, formerly one of her husband's retainers, but by that time in about 648 a [[monk]] on the island of Lindisfarne.<ref name=DNB>Thacker "[http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/29409 Wilfrid (St Wilfrid&#93; (c.634<U+2013>709/10))]" ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'' accessed 9 November 2007</ref> The monastery on the island had recently been founded by Aidan, who had been instrumental in converting Northumbria to Christianity.<ref name=Barbarian175/> At Lindisfarne Wilfrid is said to have "learned the whole [[Psalter]] by heart and several books".<ref name=QConversion181>Quoted in Yorke ''Conversion of Britain'' p. 181</ref> Wilfrid studied at Lindisfarne for a few years before going to the Kentish king's court at [[Canterbury]] in 652, where he stayed with relatives of Queen Eanfl<U+00E6>d.<ref name=DNB/> The queen had given Wilfrid a letter of introduction to pass to her cousin, King [[Eorcenberht of Kent|Eorcenberht]], in order to ensure that Wilfrid was received by the king.<ref name=Barbarian175/> While in Kent, Wilfrid's career was advanced by Eanfl<U+00E6>d's cousin [[Hlothhere of Kent|Hlothere]], who was later the [[List of monarchs of Kent|King of Kent]] from 673 to 685.<ref name=Kings36>Yorke ''Kings and Kingdoms'' pp. 36<U+2013>37</ref> The Kentish court included a number of visiting clergymen at that time, including [[Benedict Biscop]], a noted missionary.<ref name=Earliest36>Kirby ''Earliest English Kings'' p. 36</ref> Wilfrid appears to have spent about a year in Kent, but the exact chronology is uncertain.<ref name=World156>Blair ''World of Bede'' p. 156</ref>

===Time at Rome and Lyon===
[[File:7th-century Hexham crypt.jpg|250px|thumb|7th-century [[crypt]] at [[Hexham Abbey|Hexham monastery]], where Wilfrid may have deposited any relics he brought back from the continent|alt=An underground stone lined crypt.]]
Wilfrid left Kent for Rome in the company of Benedict Biscop,<ref name=EncASE>Thacker "St. Wilfrid" ''Encyclopedia of Anglo-Saxon England'' p. 474<U+2013>476</ref> another of Eanfl<U+00E6>d's contacts.<ref name=DNB/> This is the first pilgrimage to Rome known to have been undertaken by English,<ref name=Herrin267>Herrin ''Formation of Christendom'' pp. 267<U+2013>268</ref> and took place some time between 653 and 658.<ref name=Barbarian175/> According to Wilfrid's later biographer, Stephen of Ripon, Wilfred left Biscop's company at [[Lyon]], where Wilfrid stayed under the patronage of [[Annemund]], the archbishop. Stephen says that Annemund wanted to marry Wilfrid to the archbishop's niece, and to make Wilfrid the governor of a Frankish province, but that Wilfrid refused and continued on his journey to Rome.<ref name=DNB/> There he learned the Roman method of [[Computus|calculating the date of Easter]], and studied the Roman practice of relic collecting.<ref name=Brown29>Brown "Royal and Ecclesiastical" ''Renascence'' pp. 29<U+2013>31</ref> After an audience with the pope, Wilfrid returned to Lyon.<ref name=DNB/>

Stephen of Ripon says that Wilfrid stayed in Lyon for three years, leaving only after the archbishop's murder. However, Annemund's murder took place in 660 and Wilfrid returned to England in 658, suggesting that Stephen's chronology is awry.<ref name=DNB/>{{#tag:ref|Annemund was murdered at the command of [[Balthild]], the regent of [[Chlothar III]].<ref name=Levinson10>Levison ''England and the Continent'' p. 10</ref>|group=notes}} Stephen says that Annemund gave Wilfrid a clerical [[tonsure]], although this does not appear to mean that he became a monk, merely that he entered the clergy. Bede is silent on the subject,<ref name=Cubitt277>Cubitt "Clergy in Early Anglo-Saxon England" ''Historical Research'' p. 277</ref> although Wilfrid probably became a monk during his time in Rome, or afterwards while he was in Gaul.<ref name=Farmer22>Farmer "Introduction" ''Age of Bede'' p. 22</ref> Some historians, however, believe that Wilfrid was never a monk.<ref name=Cubitt277/> While in Gaul, Wilfrid absorbed Frankish ecclesiastical practices, including some aspects from the monasteries founded by [[Columbanus]]. This influence may be seen in Wilfrid's probable adoption of a Frankish ceremony in his consecration of churches later in his life, as well as in his employment of Frankish masons to build his churches.<ref name=Sanc1>Coates "Construction of Episcopal Sanctity" ''Historical Research'' pp. 1<U+2013>2</ref> Wilfrid would also have learned of the ''[[Rule of Saint Benedict]]'' in Gaul, as Columbanus' monasteries followed that monastic rule.<ref name=Ceolfrid76>Coates "Ceolfrid" ''Journal of Medieval History'' pp. 76<U+2013>77</ref>

===Abbot of Ripon===
After Wilfrid's return to Northumbria in about 658, [[Cenwalh of Wessex|Cenwalh]], [[List of monarchs of Wessex|King of Wessex]], recommended Wilfrid to [[Alhfrith of Deira|Alhfrith]], Oswiu's son, as a cleric well-versed in Roman customs and liturgy.<ref name=Earliest87/> Alhfrith was a sub-king of Deiria under his father's rule, and the most likely heir to his father's throne as his half-brothers were still young.<ref name=Convert42/> Shortly before 664 Alhfrith gave Wilfrid a [[monastery]] he had recently founded at Ripon,<ref name=EncASE/><ref name=Earliest87/> formed around a group of monks from [[Melrose Abbey]], followers of the [[Hiberno-Scottish mission|Irish monastic customs]].<ref name=Convert42>Higham ''Convert Kings'' p. 42</ref> Wilfrid ejected the abbot, Eata, because he would not follow the Roman customs;<ref name=Earliest87/> Cuthbert, later a saint, was another of the monks expelled.<ref name=DNB/> Wilfrid introduced the ''Rule of Saint Benedict'' into Ripon, claiming that he was the first person in England to make a monastery follow it,<ref name=Monasticism57>Lawrence ''Medieval Monasticism'' p. 57</ref> but this claim rests on the ''Life of Wilfrid'' and does not say where Wilfrid became knowledgeable about the Rule, nor exactly what form of the Rule was being referred to.<ref name=World199>Blair ''World of Bede'' p. 199</ref> Shortly afterwards Wilfrid was ordained a priest by [[Agilbert]], [[Bishop of Dorchester (historic)|Bishop of Dorchester]] in the kingdom of the Gewisse, part of Wessex.<ref name=Hindley78/> Wilfrid was a protege of Agilbert, who later helped in Wilfrid's consecration as a bishop.<ref name=World111>Blair ''World of Bede'' pp. 111<U+2013>112</ref> The monk [[Ceolfrith]] was attracted to Ripon from [[Gilling Abbey]], which had recently been depopulated as a result of the plague. Ceolfrith later became Abbot of Wearmouth-Jarrow during the time the medieval chronicler and writer Bede was a monk there.<ref name=World162>Blair ''World of Bede'' pp. 162<U+2013>163</ref> Bede hardly mentions the relationship between Ceolfrith and Wilfrid, but it was Wilfrid who consecrated Ceolfrith a priest and who gave permission for him to transfer to Wearmouth-Jarrow.<ref name=Ceolfrid82>Coates "Ceolfrid" ''Journal of Medieval History'' p. 82</ref>

==Whitby==
{{main|Synod of Whitby}}

===Background===
The Roman churches and those in the British Isles (often called "Celtic churches") used different methods to calculate the date of Easter. The church in Northumbria had traditionally used the former calculation, and that was the date observed by King Oswiu. His wife Eanfl<U+00E6>d and a son, Alhfrith, celebrated Easter on the Roman date however,<ref name=Making46/> which meant that while one part of the royal court was still observing the [[Lent|Lenten fast]], the second would be celebrating with feasting.<ref name=Societal52>John "Societal and Political Problems" ''Land, Church and People'' pp. 52<U+2013>53</ref>

Oswiu called a church council held at [[Whitby Abbey]] in 664 in an attempt to resolve this [[Easter controversy|controversy]]. Although Oswiu himself had been brought up in the "Celtic" tradition, political pressures may have influenced his decision to call a council, as well as fears that if dissent over the date of Easter continued in the Northumbrian church it could lead to internal strife.<ref name=Making46>Kirby ''Making of Early England'' pp. 46<U+2013>47</ref> The historian Richard Abels speculates that the expulsion of Eata from Ripon may have been the spark that led to the king's decision to call the council.<ref name=Abels9>Abels "Council of Whitby" ''Journal of British Studies'' p. 9</ref> Regional tensions within Northumbria between the two traditional divisions, [[Bernicia]] and Deira, appear to have played a part, as churchmen in Bernicia favoured the Celtic method of dating and those in Deira may have leaned towards the Roman method.<ref name=Reassess24>John ''Reassessing Anglo-Saxon England'' pp. 24<U+2013>25</ref> Abels identifies several conflicts contributing to both the calling of the council and its outcome, including a generational conflict between Oswiu and Alhfrith and the death of the Archbishop of Canterbury, [[Deusdedit of Canterbury|Deusdedit]]. Political concerns unrelated to the dating problem, such as the decline of Oswiu's preeminence among the other English kingdoms and the challenge to that position by Mercia, were also factors.<ref name=Abels2>Abels "Council of Whitby" ''Journal of British Studies'' pp. 2<U+2013>3</ref>

===Synod===
Wilfrid attended the synod, or council, of Whitby, as a member of the party favouring the continental practice of dating Easter, along with [[James the Deacon]], Agilbert, and Alhfrith. Those supporting the "Celtic" viewpoint were King Oswiu, Hilda, the Abbess of Whitby, [[Cedd]], a bishop, and [[Colm<U+00E1>n of Lindisfarne]], the [[Bishop of Lindisfarne]].<ref name=Intro131/>

Wilfred was chosen to present the Roman position to the council;<ref name=Intro131>Blair ''Introduction to Anglo-Saxon England'' p. 131</ref> he also acted as Agilbert's interpreter, as the latter did not speak the local language.<ref name=Barbarian263>Fletcher ''Barbarian Conversion'' p. 263</ref>{{#tag:ref|Agilbert was later expelled from his English bishopric by the King of Wessex when the king could not understand Agilbert.<ref name=Barbarian263/>|group=notes}} Bede describes Wilfrid as saying that those who did not calculate the date of Easter according to the Roman system were committing a sin.<ref name=World83>Blair ''World of Bede'' pp. 83<U+2013>84</ref> Wilfrid's speech in favour of adopting Roman church practices helped secure the eclipse of the "Celtic" party in 664,<ref name=Harting107/><ref name=ASE123>Stenton ''Anglo Saxon England'' 3rd ed. p. 123<U+2013>125</ref>{{#tag:ref|It is unclear how much of the speech in Bede's account of the council is actually Wilfrid's and how much was composed by Bede.<ref name=Intro131/>|group=notes}} although most Irish churches did not adopt the Roman date of Easter until 704, and [[Iona]] held out until 716.<ref name=Conversion117>Yorke ''Conversion of Britain'' p. 117</ref>{{#tag:ref|Some Welsh churches did not adopt the Roman Easter until 768.<ref name=Conversion117/>|group=notes}} Many of the Irish monasteries did not observe the Roman Easter, but they were not isolated from the continent; by the time of Whitby the southern Irish were already observing the Roman Easter date, and Irish clergy were in contact with their continental counterparts.<ref name=Brown361>Brown ''Rise of Western Christendom'' Second Edition pp. 361<U+2013>362</ref> Those monks and clergy unable to accept the Whitby decision left Northumbria, some going to Ireland<ref name=Kings84/> and others to Iona.<ref name=Earliest87>Kirby ''Earliest English Kings'' pp. 87<U+2013>88</ref>

===Elevation to the episcopate===
After the supporters of the Celtic Church had withdrawn following the Council of Whitby, Wilfrid became the most prominent Northumbrian cleric. As a result, and because of his performance at Whitby,<ref name=Reassess32>John ''Reassessing Anglo-Saxon England'' pp. 32<U+2013>33</ref> Wilfrid was elected to a bishopric in Northumbria about a year later.<ref name=Handbook224>Fryde, et al. ''Handbook of British Chronology'' p. 224</ref> It is unclear where his diocese was located, although he was considered to be Alhfrith's bishop.<ref name=Earliest87/> The ''Life of Wilfrid'' states that, nominated by both Oswiu and Alhfrith, he was made bishop at [[York]], and that he was a [[metropolitan bishop]], but York at that time was not a [[Metropolitan Diocese|metropolitan diocese]].<ref name=Societal42/>{{#tag:ref|York did not attain metropolitan status until 735.<ref name=Hall>Hall "York" ''Encyclopedia of Anglo-Saxon England'' p. 428</ref>|group=notes}} Bede says that Alhfrith alone nominated Wilfrid,<ref name=Fraser193>Fraser ''Caledonia to Pictland'' p. 193</ref> and that Oswiu subsequently proposed an alternative candidate, "imitating the actions of his son".<ref name=QFraser193>Quoted in Fraser ''Caledonia to Pictland'' p. 193</ref> Several theories have been suggested to explain the discrepancies between the two sources.<ref name=Societal42>John "Societal and Political Problems" ''Land, Church, and People'' pp. 42<U+2013>49</ref> One is that Alhfrith wished the seat to be at York,<ref name=Earliest87/> another is that Wilfrid was bishop only in Deira, a third supposes that Wilfrid was never bishop at York and that his diocese was only part of Deira.<ref name=Societal42/> However, at that time the Anglo-Saxon dioceses were not strictly speaking geographical designations, rather they were bishoprics for the tribes or peoples.<ref name=Abels17>Abels "Council of Whitby" ''Journal of British Studies'' p. 17</ref>

Wilfrid refused to be consecrated in Northumbria at the hands of Anglo-Saxon bishops. Deusdedit had died shortly after Whitby, and as there were no other bishops in Britain whom Wilfrid considered to have been validly consecrated<ref name=Earliest87/> he travelled to [[Compi<U+00E8>gne]], to be consecrated by Agilbert, the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Paris|Bishop of Paris]].<ref name=Harting129>Mayr-Harting ''Coming of Christianity'' p. 129<U+2013>147</ref> During his time in Gaul Wilfrid was exposed to a higher level of ceremony than that practised in Northumbria, one example of which is that he was carried to his consecration ceremony on a throne supported by nine bishops.<ref name=Thomson56>Thomson ''Western Church'' p. 56</ref>

===Delays and difficulties===
Wilfrid delayed his return from Gaul, only to find on his arrival back in Northumbria that Ceadda had been installed as bishop in his place.<ref name=EncASE/> The reason for Wilfrid's delay has never been clear, although the historians Eric John and Richard Abels theorise that it was caused by Alhfrith's unsuccessful revolt against Oswiu. They suggest that the rebellion happened shortly after Whitby, and while Wilfrid was in Gaul for his consecration. Because Oswiu knew that Alhfrith had been a supporter of Wilfrid's, Oswiu prevented Wilfrid's return, suspecting Wilfrid of supporting his rivals.<ref name=Reassess32/><ref name=Abels18>Abels "Council of Whitby" ''Journal of British Studies'' pp. 18<U+2013>19</ref> That Ceadda was supported by Oswiu, and Wilfrid had been a supporter of Oswiu's son, lends further credence to the theory that Alhfrith's rebellion took place while Wilfrid was in Gaul.<ref name=Farmer23>Farmer "Introduction" ''Age of Bede'' p. 23</ref>

During his return to Northumbria Wilfrid's ship was blown ashore on the Sussex coast, the inhabitants of which were at that time pagan. On being attacked by the locals, Wilfrid's party killed the head priest before refloating their ship and making their escape.<ref name=DNB/> The historian Marion Gibbs suggests that after this episode Wilfrid visited [[Kent]] again, and took part in the diplomacy related to [[Wighard|Wigheard]]'s appointment to the See of Canterbury. Wilfrid may also have taken part in negotiations to persuade King Cenwalh of Wessex to allow Agilbert to return to his see.<ref name=Gibbs220>Gibbs "Decrees of Agatho" ''Speculum'' pp. 220<U+2013>221</ref>

===Favourable outcome===
Denied episcopal office, Wilfrid spent the three years from 665 to 668 as abbot of the monastery at Ripon.<ref name=Reassess34>John ''Reassessing Anglo-Saxon England'' pp. 34<U+2013>35</ref> He occasionally performed episcopal functions in Mercia and Kent, but never did so north of the river [[Humber]].<ref name=Earliest87/> The historian James Fraser argues that Wilfrid may not have been allowed to return to Northumbria and instead went into exile at the Mercian court,<ref name=Fraser193/> but most historians have argued that Wilfrid was at Ripon.<ref name=DNB/><ref name=Earliest87/><ref name=Reassess34/>

While at York, Wilfrid was considered the "bishop of the Northumbrian peoples"; Bede records that Wilfrid's diocese was contiguous with the area ruled by Oswiu.<ref name=Earliest21>Kirby ''Earliest English Kings'' p. 21</ref> The diocese was restricted to north of the Humber, however.<ref name=Earliest22>Kirby ''Earliest English Kings'' p. 22</ref> Wilfrid may also have sought to exercise some ecclesiastical functions in the [[Picts|Pictish kingdom]], as he is accorded the title "bishop of the Northumbrians and the Picts" in 669.<!-- by what? --> Further proof of attempted Northumbrian influence in the Pictish regions is provided by the establishment for the Picts in 681 of a diocese centred on [[Abercorn]], in the old territory of the British kingdom of Gododdin.

===Diocesan affairs===
Wilfrid did not attend the [[Council of Hertford]] held in September 672, but he did send representatives. Among the council's resolutions was one postponing a decision on the creation of new dioceses, which affected Wilfrid later.<ref name=ASE133>Stenton ''Anglo Saxon England'' 3rd ed. pp. 133<U+2013>134</ref> Another ruling confirmed that the Roman calculation for the date of Easter should be adopted, and that bishops should act only in their own dioceses.<ref name=Intro136>Blair ''Introduction to Anglo-Saxon England'' p. 136</ref> During the middle 670s Wilfrid acted as middleman in the negotiations to return a [[Merovingian dynasty|Merovingian]] prince, [[Dagobert II]], from his exile in Ireland to Gaul.<ref name=Making265>Kirby ''Making of Early England'' p. 265</ref>{{#tag:ref|Dagobert became king of [[Austrasia]] in 676, but was assassinated in 680.<ref name=Long238>Wallace-Hadrill ''Long-haired Kings'' p. 238</ref>|group=notes}} Wilfrid was one of the first churchmen in Northumbria to utilise written [[charter]]s as records of gifts to his churches. He ordered the creation of a listing of all benefactions received by Ripon, which was recited at the dedication ceremony.<ref name=DNB/>

Wilfrid was an advocate for the use of music in ecclesiastical ceremonies. He sent to Kent for a singing master to instruct his clergy in the Roman style of church music, which involved a double choir who sang in [[antiphon]]s and responses.<ref name=DNB/> Bede says that this singing master was named <U+00C6>ddi (or Eddius in Latin) and had the surname Stephen. Traditionally historians have identified <U+00C6>ddi as Stephen of Ripon, author of the ''Life of Wilfrid'', which has led to the assumption that the ''Life'' was based on the recollections of one of Wilfrid's long-time companions. However, recent scholarship has come to believe that the ''Life'' was not authored by the singing master, but by someone who joined Wilfrid in the last years of Wilfrid's life, not a close companion.<ref name=Bede102>Kirby "Bede" ''English Historical Review'' pp. 102<U+2013>104</ref>

Wilfrid introduced the ''Rule of Saint Benedict'' into the monasteries he founded.<ref name=DNB/> It appears likely that he was the first to introduce the Benedictine Rule into England, as evidence is lacking that [[Augustine of Canterbury|Augustine]]'s monastery at Canterbury followed the ''Rule''.<ref name=Reassess35/> He also was one of the first Anglo-Saxon bishops to record the gifts of land and property to his church, which he did at Ripon. Easter tables, used to calculate the correct date to celebrate Easter, were brought in from Rome where the [[Dionysius Exiguus' Easter table|Dionysiac Easter tables]] had been recently introduced.<ref name=DNB/> He set up schools and became a religious advisor to the Northumbrian queen [[<U+00C6>thelthryth]], first wife of Ecgfrith. <U+00C6>thelthryth donated the land at [[Hexham]] where Wilfrid founded a monastery and built a church using some recycled stones from the Roman town of [[Corbridge]].<ref name=Society190>Blair ''Church in Anglo-Saxon Society'' pp. 190<U+2013>191</ref><ref name=ASE135>Stenton ''Anglo Saxon England'' 3rd ed. p. 135</ref> When Wilfrid arrived in York as bishop the cathedral's roof was on the point of collapse; he had it repaired and covered in lead, and had glass set in the windows.<ref name=Intro146>Blair ''Introduction to Anglo-Saxon England'' p. 146</ref>

The historian [[Barbara Yorke]] says of Wilfrid at this time that he "seems to have continued a campaign against any survival of 'Irish errors' and distrusted any communities that remained in contact with Iona or other Irish religious houses which did not follow the Roman Easter".<ref name=Conversion12>Yorke ''Conversion of Britain'' p. 12</ref> He also worked to combat pagan practices, building a church at [[Melrose, Scottish Borders|Melrose]] on a pagan site.<ref name=Society186>Blair ''Church in Anglo-Saxon Society'' p. 186</ref> Contemporaries said of him that he was the first native bishop to "introduce the Catholic way of life to the churches of the English".<ref name=QBrown359>Quoted in Brown ''Rise of Western Christendom'' Second Edition p. 359</ref> He did not neglect his pastoral duties in his diocese,<ref name=Barbarian175/> making visits throughout the diocese to baptise and perform other episcopal functions, such as consecrating new churches.<ref name=Society94>Blair ''Church in Anglo-Saxon Society'' p. 94</ref> Some of the monasteries in his diocese were put under his protection by their abbots or abbesses, who were seeking someone to help protect their endowments.<ref name=Farmer24>Farmer "Introduction" ''Age of Bede'' p. 24</ref> In ruling over such monasteries, Wilfrid may have been influenced by the Irish model of a group of monasteries all ruled by one person, sometimes while holding episcopal office.<ref name=Century65>Campbell "First Century of Christianity" ''Essays in Anglo-Saxon History'' p. 65</ref>

Wilfrid was criticised for dressing his household and servants in clothing fit for royalty.<ref name=Dodwell179>Dodwell ''Anglo-Saxon Art'' p. 179</ref> He was accompanied on his travels by a retinue of warriors, one of whom, while at York, Wilfrid sent to abduct a young boy who had been promised to the church but whose family had changed their mind.<ref name=Fraser78>Fraser ''Caledonia to Pictland'' p. 78</ref> Wilfrid also educated young men, both for clerical and secular careers.<ref name=Fraser63>Fraser ''Caledonia to Pictland'' p. 63</ref>

===Dispute with the king===
In 677<ref name=ASE136>Stenton ''Anglo Saxon England'' 3rd ed. p. 136</ref> or 678, Wilfrid and Ecgfrith quarrelled, and Wilfrid was expelled from his see.<ref name=DNB/> Abbess [[Hilda of Whitby]] was a leader in a faction of the Northumbrian church that disliked Wilfrid, and her close ties with Theodore helped to undermine Wilfrid's position in Northumbria.<ref name=EncASE/> Another contributory factor in Wilfrid's expulsion was his encouragement of <U+00C6>thelthryth's entry into a nunnery;<ref name=ASE135/> he had personally given her the [[veil]] on her retirement to Ely Abbey.<ref name=Narr322/> <U+00C6>thelthryth had donated the lands Wilfrid used to found Hexham Abbey, and the historian N. J. Higham argues that they had been part of the queen's [[Dower|dower lands]], which, when Ecgfrith remarried, his new queen wanted to recover.<ref name=Northumbria135>Higham ''Kingdom of Northumbria'' pp. 135<U+2013>136</ref> The historian Eric John feels that Wilfrid's close ties with the Mercian kingdom also contributed to his troubles with Egfrith, although John points out that these ties were necessary for Wilfrid's monastic foundations, some of which were in Mercia.<ref name=Reassess35/> Wilfrid not only lost his diocese, he lost control of his monasteries as well.<ref name=Reassess34/>

Theodore took advantage of the situation to implement the decrees of the council on dividing up large dioceses.<ref name=Reassess34/> Theodore set up new bishoprics from Wilfrid's diocese, with seats at [[Archbishop of York|York]], Hexham, Lindisfarne, and one in the region of [[kingdom of Lindsey|Lindsey]]. The Lindsey see was quickly absorbed by the [[Diocese of Lichfield]], but the other three remained separate.<ref name=Making48>Kirby ''Making of Early England'' pp. 48<U+2013>49</ref> The bishops chosen for these sees, [[Eata of Hexham|Eata]] at Hexham, [[Eadh<U+00E6>d]] at Lindsey, and Bosa at York, had all either been supporters of the "Celtic" party at Whitby, or been trained by those who were.<ref name=Earliest90/> Eata had also been ejected from Ripon by Wilfrid.<ref name=Earliest87/> The new bishops were unacceptable to Wilfrid, who claimed they were not truly members of the Catholic Church because of their support for the "Celtic" method of dating Easter, and thus he could not serve alongside them.<ref name=Earliest90/> Another possible problem for Wilfrid was that the three new bishops did not come from Wilfrid's monastic houses nor from the communities where the bishops' seats were based. This was contrary to the custom of the time, which was to promote bishoprics from within the locality.<ref name=Society98>Blair ''Church in Anglo-Saxon Society'' pp. 98<U+2013>99</ref> Wilfrid's deposition became tangled up in a dispute over whether or not the Gregorian plan for Britain, with two metropolitan sees, the northern one set at York, would be followed through or abandoned.<ref name=Gibbs216>Gibbs "Decrees of Agatho" ''Speculum'' p. 216</ref> Wilfrid seems to have felt that he had metropolitan authority over the northern part of England, but Theodore never acknowledged that claim, instead claiming authority over the whole of the island of Britain.<ref name=Fraser209>Fraser ''Caledonia to Pictland'' pp. 209<U+2013>210</ref>

===Appeal to Rome===
Wilfrid went to Rome after his expulsion to appeal against Theodore and Ecgfrith's decisions,<ref name=ASE136/><ref name=Hindley48>Hindley ''A Brief History of the Anglo-Saxons'' p. 48</ref> the first Englishman to challenge a royal or ecclesiastical decision by petitioning the papacy.<ref name=Reassess34/>{{#tag:ref|And he was the only English bishop to appeal a royal verdict to the papacy until 1088 when [[William de St-Calais]] appealed a decision of King [[William II of England]] to Rome.<ref name=West184>Southern ''Western Society'' pp. 184<U+2013>185</ref>|group=notes}} On the way he stopped at the court of [[Aldgisl]], the [[List of rulers of Frisia|Frisian king]] in [[Utrecht (city)|Utrecht]] for most of 678.<ref name=ASE136/> Wilfrid had been blown off course on his trip from England to the continent, and ended up in Frisia according to some historians.<ref name=Intro137>Blair ''Introduction to Anglo-Saxon England'' p. 137</ref> Others state that he intended to journey via Frisia to avoid [[Neustria]], whose [[Mayor of the Palace|mayor of the palace]], [[Ebroin]], disliked Wilfrid.<ref name=DNB/> He wintered in Frisia, avoiding the diplomatic efforts of Ebroin, who according to Stephen attempted to have Wilfrid killed. During his stay, Wilfrid attempted to convert the Frisians, who were still pagan at that time. Wilfrid's biographer says that most of the nobles converted,<ref name=Levinson50>Levison ''England and the Continent'' pp. 50<U+2013>51</ref> but the success was short-lived.<ref name=Hindley121/> After Frisia, he stopped at the court of Dagobert II in Gaul, where the king offered Wilfrid the [[Archbishopric of Strasbourg|Bishopric of Strasbourg]], which Wilfrid refused.<ref name=DNB/> Once in Italy, Wilfrid was received by Perctarit, a Lombard king, who gave him a place at his court.<ref name=Levinson14>Levison ''England and the Continent'' p. 14</ref>

Pope Agatho held a synod in October 679, which although it ordered Wilfrid's restoration and the return of the monasteries to his control, also directed that the new dioceses should be retained.<ref name=ASE136/> Wilfrid was, however, given the right to replace any bishop in the new dioceses to whom he objected.<ref name=Reassess34/>{{#tag:ref|The copy of the decrees of Agatho has had interpolations added to it, partly to support the later [[Canterbury-York dispute]]s over primacy that started under Archbishop [[Lanfranc]] after the [[Norman conquest of England|Norman Conquest of England]].

In fact, the historian [[Henry Chadwick (theologian)|Henry Chadwick]] thought that one reason Wilfrid secured the mostly favourable outcome was that Agatho wished for Wilfrid's support and testimony that the English Church was free of the monothelete heresy.<ref name=Chadwick>Chadwick "Theodore" ''Archbishop Theodore'' pp. 88<U+2013>95</ref> Although Wilfrid did not win a complete victory, he did secure a papal decree limiting the number of dioceses in England to 12.<ref name=ASG57>Loyn ''Anglo-Saxon Governance'' p. 57</ref> Wilfrid also secured the right for his monasteries of Ripon and Hexham to be directly supervised by the pope, preventing any further interference in their affairs by the diocesan bishops.<ref name=Levinson24>Levison ''England and the Continent'' pp. 24<U+2013>25</ref>

Wilfrid returned to England after the council via Gaul. According to Stephen of Ripon, after the death of [[Dagobert II]], Ebroin wished to imprison Wilfrid, but Wilfrid miraculously escaped.<ref name=Life142>Eddius Stephanus "Life of Wilfrid" ''Age of Bede'' pp. 142<U+2013>143</ref> In 680 Wilfrid returned to Northumbria and appeared before a royal council. He produced his papal decree ordering his restoration, but was instead briefly imprisoned and then exiled by the king.<ref name=Lyon49>Lyon ''A Constitutional and Legal History of Medieval England'' p. 49</ref><ref name=Harting118>Mayr-Harting ''Coming of Christianity'' p. 118</ref> Wilfrid stayed for a short time in the kingdom of the Middle Angles and at Wessex,<ref name=Reassess34/> but soon took refuge in Sussex with King [[<U+00C6>thelwealh of Sussex]].<ref name=ASE138>Stenton ''Anglo Saxon England'' 3rd ed. p. 138</ref>

==Missions in Sussex==
[[File:Selsey - West Sussex dot.png|Map showing the location of Selsey|thumb| upright |right|alt=Map showing Selsey on the southern coast of England in the central section.]]
Wilfrid spent the next five years preaching to, and converting the pagan inhabitants of Sussex, the South Saxons. He also founded [[Selsey Abbey]],<ref name=EncASE/> on an estate near Selsey of 87 [[Hide (unit)|hides]], given to Wilfrid by <U+00C6>thelwealh, king of the South Saxons.<ref name=Tyler149>Tyler "Reluctant Kings" ''History'' p. 149</ref> Bede attributes Wilfrid's ability to convert the South Saxons to his teaching them how to fish, and contrasts it with the lack of success of the Irish monk Dicuill.<ref name=Coates180>Coates "Role of Bishops" ''History'' p. 180</ref> Bede also says that the Sussex area had been experiencing a drought for three years before Wilfrid's arrival, but miraculously when Wilfrid arrived, and started baptising converts, rain began to fall.<ref name=Barbarian244>Fletcher ''Barbarian Conversion'' p. 244</ref> Wilfrid worked with Bishop [[Erkenwald]] of London, helping to set up the church in Sussex. Erkenwald also helped reconcile Wilfrid and Theodore before Theodore's death in 690.<ref name=Kings56>Yorke ''Kings and Kingdoms'' p. 56</ref> The mission was jeopardised when King <U+00C6>thelwealh died during an invasion of his kingdom by [[C<U+00E6>dwalla of Wessex]].<ref name=Reassess34/> Wilfrid previously had contact with C<U+00E6>dwalla, and may have served as his spiritual advisor before C<U+00E6>dwalla's invasion of Sussex.<ref name=Earliest100/> After <U+00C6>thelwealh's death and C<U+00E6>dwalla's accession to the throne of Wessex, Wilfrid became one of the new king's advisors, and the king was converted.<ref name=Making50/> C<U+00E6>dwalla confirmed <U+00C6>thelwealh's grant of land in the Selsey area and Wilfrid built his [[Cathedral|cathedral church]] near the entrance to [[Pagham Harbour]] believed to be what is now Church Norton.<ref>Mee ''History of Selsey'' pp. 12<U+2013>13</ref> 

C<U+00E6>dwalla sent Wilfrid to the [[Isle of Wight]], which was still pagan, with the aim of converting the inhabitants.<ref name=Reassess34/>{{#tag:ref|When Wilfrid returned to Northumbria, he gave the Wight mission to his nephew,<ref name=Reassess34/> Beornwine, who was not apparently an ordained priest.<ref name=Society90>Blair ''Church in Anglo-Saxon Society'' p. 90</ref>|group=notes}} The king also gave Wilfrid a quarter of the land on the island as a gift.<ref name=Kings164>Yorke ''Kings and Kingdoms'' p. 164</ref> In 688, the king relinquished his throne and went on a pilgrimage to Rome to be baptised, but died shortly after the ceremony.<ref name=Making50>Kirby ''Making of Early England'' p. 50</ref> Wilfrid was probably influential in C<U+00E6>dwalla's decision to be baptised in Rome.<ref name=Earliest100/>

During his time in Sussex Wilfrid was reconciled with Archbishop Theodore; the ''Life of St. Wilfrid'' says that Theodore expressed a desire for Wilfrid to succeed him at Canterbury.<ref name=Earliest102>Kirby ''Earliest English Kings'' p. 102</ref> Wilfrid may have been involved in founding monasteries near [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]] as well as in other parts of Sussex, but the evidence backing this is based on the wording used in the founding charters resembling wording used by Wilfrid in other charters, not on any concrete statements that Wilfrid was involved.<ref name=Society96>Blair ''Church in Anglo-Saxon Society'' p. 96</ref>

==Return to Northumbria and exile==
===Return from exile===
In 686 Wilfrid was recalled to Northumbria after the death of Ecgfrith in battle with the Picts.<ref name=Handbook224/><ref name=ASE139>Stenton ''Anglo Saxon England'' p. 139</ref> During the 680s Theodore had created two more dioceses in Northumbria, at Ripon, and at Abercorn in the Pictish kingdom, but both were short-lived.<ref name=Making48/> After Ecgfrith's death, Theodore wrote to the new king of Northumbria, Aldfrith, and to [[<U+00C6>thelred of Mercia|<U+00C6>thelred]], king of Mercia and the Abbess of Whitby, <U+00C6>lffl<U+00E6>d, suggesting that an agreement be made allowing Wilfrid's return to Northumbria. Aldfrith agreed, Wilfrid returned to the north, and Bosa was removed from York. Wilfrid did not recover the whole of his previous bishopric however, as Hexham and Lindisfarne remained separate sees.<ref name=DNB/>{{#tag:ref|The only authority for the expulsion of Bosa is Stephen of Ripon's ''Life of Wilfrid'', and it is possible that Bosa was not expelled, as he was still bishop at his death in 706.<ref name=Usurp20>Cubitt "Wilfrid's "Usurping Bishops"" ''Northern History'' pp. 20<U+2013>21</ref>|group=notes}}

Wilfrid appears to have lived at Ripon, and for a time he acted as administrator of the see of Lindisfarne after Cuthbert's death in 687.<ref name=ASE139/> In 691, the subdivision issue arose once more, along with quarrels with the new King Aldfrith over lands,<ref name=DNB/> and attempts were made to make Wilfrid either give up all his lands or to stay confined to Ripon.<ref name=Society96/> A proposal to turn Ripon into a bishopric was also a source of dispute. When no compromise was possible Wilfrid left Northumbria for Mercia, and Bosa was returned to York.<ref name=DNB/>

Something of the reception to Wilfrid's expulsion can be picked up in a Latin letter which has survived only in an incomplete quotation by [[William of Malmesbury]] in his ''Gesta Pontificum''. We have it on William's authority that the letter was written by [[Aldhelm]] of Malmesbury and addressed to Wilfrid's abbots. In it, Aldhelm asks the clergymen to remember the exiled bishop "who, nourishing, teaching, reproving, raised you in fatherly love" and appealing to lay aristocratic ideals of loyalty, urges them not to abandon their superior.<ref>Ehwald (ed.) ''Aldhelmi Opera'' pp. 500<U+2013>502</ref><ref>Whitelock ''English Historical Documents'' no. 165</ref> Neither William nor the citation itself gives a date, but the letter has been assigned to Wilfrid's exile under Aldfrith in the 690s.<ref>Foley ''Images of Sanctity'' p. 53.</ref>

===Mercia===
During his stay in Mercia Wilfrid acted as bishop with the consent of King <U+00C6>thelred.<ref name=Earliest120>Kirby ''Earliest English Kings'' pp. 120<U+2013>121</ref> Information on Wilfrid's life at this time is meagre, as the ''Life of Wilfrid'' says little of that period.<ref name=Bede105>Kirby "Bede" ''English Historical Review'' p. 105</ref> He is generally considered to have been Bishop of Leicester until about 706, when he is held to have been transferred to Hexham.<ref name=Handbook218>Fryde, et al. ''Handbook of British Chronology'' p. 218</ref> Wilfrid became involved in the missionary efforts to the [[Frisians]], which he had started in 678 during his stay in Frisia. Wilfrid helped the missionary efforts of Willibrord, which were more successful than his own earlier attempts.<ref name=Hindley121>Hindley ''A Brief History of the Anglo-Saxons'' pp. 121<U+2013>122</ref> Willibrord was a monk of Ripon who was also a native of Northumbria.<ref name=Barbarian199>Fletcher ''Barbarian Conversion'' p. 199</ref>

Wilfrid was present at the exhumation of the body of Queen <U+00C6>thelthryth at [[Ely Cathedral|Ely Abbey]] in 695. He had been her spiritual advisor in the 670s, and had helped the queen become a nun against the wishes of her husband King [[Ecgfrith of Northumbria]]. The queen had joined Ely Abbey, where she died in 679. The ceremony in 695 found that her body had not decayed, which led to her being declared a saint.<ref name=Narr260>Goffart ''Narrators'' pp. 260<U+2013>261</ref> Wilfrid's testimony as to the character and virginity of <U+00C6>thelthryth was recorded by [[Bede]].<ref name=Narr322>Goffart ''Narrators'' p. 322</ref>

In about 700, Wilfrid appealed once more to Pope [[Pope Sergius I|Sergius I]] over his expulsion from York, and the pope referred the issue back to a council in England. In 702 King Aldfrith held a [[Council of Austerfield|council]] at [[Austerfield]] that upheld Wilfrid's expulsion, and once more Wilfrid travelled to Rome to appeal to the pope.<ref name=ASE143/> The ''Life of Wilfrid'' gives a speech, supposedly delivered by Wilfrid there, in defence of Wilfrid's record over the previous 40&nbsp;years.<ref name=Narr263>Goffart ''Narrators'' pp. 263<U+2013>264</ref> The council was presided over by [[Berhtwald]], the new Archbishop of Canterbury, and the decision of the council was that Wilfrid should be deprived of all his monasteries but Ripon, and that he should cease to perform episcopal functions. When Wilfrid continued his appeal to the papacy, his opponents had him and his supporters excommunicated.<ref name=DNB/>

===Rome and final return to Northumbria===
On his way to Rome Wilfrid stopped in Frisia to visit Willibrord.<ref name=Levinson50/> Following Wilfrid's arrival in Rome the pope held a council, which declared that the King of Northumbria should follow the earlier papal decrees restoring Wilfrid to his see.<ref name=ASE143>Stenton ''Anglo-Saxon England'' p. 143</ref> Wilfrid was disconcerted to find that the [[Roman Curia|papal court]] spoke Greek, and his biographer noted that Wilfrid was displeased when the pope discussed the appeal with advisers in a language Wilfrid could not understand.<ref name=West57/> The pope also ordered another council to be held in England to decide the issue, and ordered the attendance of Bosa, Berhtwald and Wilfrid. On his journey back to England Wilfrid had a seizure at [[Meaux]], but he had returned to Kent by 705.<ref name=DNB/>

Aldfrith died soon after Wilfrid's arrival back in England. The new king, [[Eadwulf I of Northumbria|Eadwulf]], had been considered one of Wilfrid's friends, but after his accession to the throne he ordered Wilfrid to stay out of Northumbria. Eadwulf's reign lasted only a few months however, before he was expelled to make way for Aldfrith's son [[Osred I of Northumbria|Osred]],<ref name=DNB/> to whom Wilfrid acted as spiritual adviser.<ref name=EncASE/> Wilfrid may have been one of Osred's chief supporters, along with Oswiu's daughter Abbess <U+00C6>lffl<U+00E6>d of Whitby,<ref name=Kings88>Yorke ''Kings and Kingdoms'' p. 88</ref> and the nobleman [[Beornh<U+00E6>th]].<ref name=Kings92>Yorke ''Kings and Kingdoms'' p. 92</ref> Once Osred was secure on the throne Wilfrid was restored to Ripon and Hexham in 706. When Bosa of York died, however, Wilfrid did not contest the decision to appoint John of Beverley to the See of York. This appointment meant John's transfer from the See of Hexham, leaving Wilfrid free to perform episcopal functions at Hexham,<ref name=DNB/> which he did until his death.<ref name=Narr271>Goffart ''Narrators'' p. 271</ref>

==Other aspects==
===Cult of St Oswald===
{{main|Oswald of Northumbria}}
Sometime after the translation of the relics of [[Oswald of Northumbria]] to [[Bardney Abbey]] by [[Osthryth]] between 675 and 679,<ref name=OswaldDNB>Craid "Oswald" ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography''</ref> Wilfrid, along with Hexham Abbey, began to encourage and promote the cult of the dead king. The historian Barbara Yorke sees this advocacy as a major factor in the prominence given to Oswald in Bede's ''[[Historia ecclesiastica gentis Anglorum|Ecclesiastical History]]''.<ref name=Courts249>Yorke "Adaptation of the Anglo-Saxon Royal Courts" ''Cross Goes North'' p. 249</ref> Historian D. P. Kirby regards Wilfrid's championing of Oswald as being a contributing factor in Wilfrid's expulsion from York in 678. Kirby believes that Ecgfrith felt Wilfrid was promoting Oswald's branch of the Northumbrian royal family over his own.<ref name=Earliest90/> One of Wilfrid's proteges, [[Willibrord]], became a missionary to the Frisians in 695, perhaps inspired by Wilfrid's example. Willibrord may have felt it expedient to leave Northumbria, where he was known as one of Wilfrid's followers.<ref name=Reassess57>John ''Reassessing Anglo-Saxon England'' p. 57</ref>

===Monastic network===
[[Image:Swilfrid1.jpg|thumb|right| upright=1.4 |Later engraving of a picture commissioned in 1519 showing C<U+00E6>dwalla confirming a grant of land, at Selsey, to Wilfrid|alt=A crowned man hands a scroll to a tonsured man. The crowned man is standing on the steps of a building, surrounded by other men. The man receiving the scroll stands in front of the building, also surrounded by other men.]]

Wilfrid's network of monasteries extended across at least three of the kingdoms of England in his day.<ref name=Campbell46>Campbell ''Anglo-Saxon State'' p. 46</ref> They included Hexham, Ripon, Selsey, and Oundle,<ref name=Barbarian175/> as well as possibly [[Peterborough Cathedral|Peterborough]], [[Brixworth]], [[Evesham Abbey|Evesham]], [[Wing, Buckinghamshire|Wing]], and [[Withington, Gloucestershire|Withington]].<ref name=Farmer26>Farmer "Introduction" ''Age of Bede'' p. 26</ref> At his monasteries and dioceses he built churches in a style akin to that of the continent and Rome,<ref name=Brown52>Brown ''Rise of Western Christendom'' Second Edition p. 52</ref> travelling between them with a large entourage of up to 120&nbsp;followers.<ref name=Brown361/> He made many contacts and friends, not only in Northumbria and the other English kingdoms, but also in Gaul, Frisia, and Italy. Nobles sent their sons to him for [[Fosterage|fostering]], and Wilfrid was known to help his proteges, no matter if they became clerics or not. The historian [[Peter Brown (historian)|Peter Brown]] speculated that one reason for Wilfrid's exile in 678 was that he was overshadowing the king as a patron.<ref name=Brown362>Brown ''Rise of Western Christendom'' Second Edition pp. 362<U+2013>363</ref> His contacts extended to the [[Lombards|Lombard kingdom]] in Italy, where they included King [[Perctarit]] and his son [[Cunipert]].<ref name=Barbarian175/>

Wilfrid was a prolific founder of churches, which he then controlled until his death, and was a great fundraiser, acquiring lands and money from many of the kings he was in contact with.<ref name=Society97>Blair ''Church in Anglo-Saxon Society'' p. 97</ref> He was also noted for his ability to attract support from powerful women, especially queens. Queen Eanfl<U+00E6>d, his first patron, introduced him to a number of helpful contacts, and he later attracted the support of Queen <U+00C6>thelthryth, who gave the endowment for Hexham Abbey.<ref name=Tyler156>Tyler "Reluctant Kings" ''History'' p. 156</ref> [[<U+00C6>lffl<U+00E6>d of Whitby|<U+00C6>lffl<U+00E6>d]], sister of King Aldfrith of Northumbria and daughter of Wilfrid's old patron Queen Eanfl<U+00E6>d, helped to persuade the Northumbrians to allow Wilfrid to return from his last exile.<ref name=Mitchell37>Mitchell "Anglo-Saxon Double Monasteries" ''History Today'' p. 37</ref><ref name=BASEAelff>Thacker "<U+00C6>lffl<U+00E6>d" ''Blackwell Encyclopedia of Anglo-Saxon England'' p. 6</ref>

===Builder and artistic patron===
Wilfrid built a church capable of accommodating a congregation of 2,000 at Hexham, using stone from [[Hadrian's Wall]].<ref name=Brown362/> The 12th-century writer [[Ailred of Rievaulx]], whose family helped restore Hexham, credited Wilfrid as the designer of a church beautifully embellished with paintings and sculpture.<ref name=Dodwell92>Dodwell ''Anglo-Saxon Art'' pp. 92 and 275 footnote 38</ref><ref name=Gilbert81>Gilbert "Saint Wilfrid's Church at Hexam" ''Saint Wilfrid at Hexham'' p. 81</ref> It appears that the churches at Hexham and Ripon (which Wilfrid also built) were aisled [[basilica]]s, of the type that was common on the continent. Ripon was the first church in Northumbria to incorporate a [[Portico|''porticus'']], similar to those of churches in Kent.<ref name=Farmer45>Farmer "Saint Wilfrid" ''Saint Wilfrid at Hexham'' p. 45</ref> 12th-century pilgrims' accounts declared that the church at Hexham rivalled those of Rome.<ref name=DNB/> The crypts at both Ripon and Hexham are unusual, and perhaps were intended by Wilfrid to mimic the [[Catacombs of Rome|Roman catacombs]] which he had seen on his travels.<ref name=DNB/> They are still extant, although the fabric of Wilfrid's churches above ground has been replaced by later structures. The churches were finished with glazed windows, made by glassmakers brought over from the continent.<ref name=Making259>Kirby ''Making of Early England'' p. 259</ref>

As well as his building projects Wilfrid also commissioned works to embellish the churches, including altar cloths made of silk woven with gold threads, and a [[gospel book]] written on [[purple parchment|parchment dyed purple]], with gold lettering. The gospels were then enclosed in a gold book cover set with gems. When the church he had built at Ripon was consecrated, a three-day feast was held to accompany the ceremony.<ref name=Barbarian175/>{{#tag:ref|The book, which was given to Ripon, does not survive.<ref name=World228>Blair ''World of Bede'' p. 228</ref>|group=notes}}

==Resignation and death==
After his final return to Northumbria Wilfrid retired to the monastery at [[Ripon Cathedral|Ripon]], where he lived until his death during a visit to Oundle,<ref name=Hindley62/> at the age of 75.<ref name=Making158>Kirby ''Making of Early England'' p. 158</ref> A little over a year before his death in either 709<ref name=Hindley62>Hindley ''A Brief History of the Anglo-Saxons'' p. 62</ref> or 710<ref name=Bede101>Kirby "Bede" ''English Historical Review'' p. 101</ref>{{#tag:ref|Both years are given as death dates in sources. The discrepancy over his death date involves the fact that two dates were associated with Wilfrid's cult, 24&nbsp;April and 12&nbsp;October. Stephen of Ripon expressly states that Wilfrid died on a Thursday, and neither date in 709 was a Thursday. 24&nbsp;April 710, however, was a Thursday, and is likely to be Wilfrid's death date. A complication is the fact that the October date is the more common commemoration date, but the April date is the one first associated with Wilfrid's cult, appearing in 7th- and 8th-century saints calendars. The October date probably arose because the April date conflicted with [[Lent]] and [[Easter]].<ref name=DNB/>|group=notes}} Wilfrid suffered another stroke or seizure, which led him to make arrangements for the disposition of his monasteries and possessions. He was buried near the altar of his church in Ripon. Bede records the epitaph that was placed on the tomb.<ref name=DNB/>{{#tag:ref|The epitaph is recorded in Book V, Chapter XIX. An online translation is at the Medieval Sourcebook, part of the Online Reference Book for Medieval Studies by the [[City University of New York]].|group=notes}} Wilfrid was succeeded at Hexham by Acca of Hexham, a protege who had accompanied him to Rome in 703.<ref name=World189>Blair ''World of Bede'' p. 189</ref><ref name=Levinson61>Levison ''England and the Continent'' p. 61</ref> The monastery at Ripon celebrated the first anniversary of Wilfrid's death with a commemoration service attended by all the abbots of his monasteries and a spectacular white arc was said to have appeared in the sky starting from the gables of the basilica where his bones were laid to rest.<ref name=Narr271/><ref>Farmer ''Age of Bede '' p.182</ref><ref>Forster ''St Wilfrid of Ripon'' p.16</ref>

Wilfrid left large sums of money to his monastic foundations, enabling them to purchase royal favour.<ref name=Conversion163/> Soon after his death a ''Vita Wilfredi'', or ''Life of Wilfrid'', was written by Stephen of Ripon, a monk of Ripon.<ref name=Hindley62/> The first version appeared in about 715 followed by a later revision in the 730s,<ref name=Conversion12/> the first biography written by a contemporary to appear in England.<ref name=Farmer38>Farmer "Saint Wilfrid" ''Saint Wilfrid at Hexham'' p. 38</ref>
It was commissioned by two of Wilfrid's followers, Acca of Hexham, and the Abbot of Ripon, Tatbert.<ref name=Barbarian175>Fletcher ''Barbarian Conversion'' pp. 175<U+2013>180</ref> Stephen's ''Life'' is concerned with vindicating Wilfrid and making a case for his sainthood, and so is used with caution by historians,<ref name=Earliest100>Kirby ''Earliest English Kings'' p. 100</ref><ref name=Kings73>Yorke ''Kings and Kingdoms'' p. 73</ref> although it is nevertheless an invaluable source for Wilfrid's life and the history of the time.<ref name=Barbarian175/>

Wilfrid's [[Calendar of saints|feast day]] is 12 October<ref name=OBD411/> or 24 April.<ref name=Walsh623>Walsh ''A New Dictionary of Saints'' p. 623<U+2013>624</ref> Both dates were celebrated in [[Early Middle Ages|early medieval]] England, but the April date appears first in the liturgical calendars.<ref name=DNB/> The April date is usually celebrated as his translation date.<ref name=ODS536/> Immediately after his death his body was venerated as a cult object, and miracles were alleged to have happened at the spot where the water used to wash his body was discarded.<ref name=DNB/> A cult grew up at Ripon after his death and remained active until 948, when King [[Eadred of England|Eadred]] destroyed the church at Ripon; after the destruction, Wilfrid's relics were taken by Archbishop [[Oda (Archbishop of Canterbury)|Oda of Canterbury]],<ref name=Society314>Blair ''Church in Anglo-Saxon Society'' p. 314</ref> and held in [[Canterbury Cathedral]].<ref name=Gem>Gem "Significance of the 11th century Rebuilding of Christ Church and St Augustine's, Canterbury" ''Medieval Art and Architecture at Canterbury Before 1220'' p. 2</ref> This account appears in a foreword written by Oda for [[Frithegod]]'s later poem on Wilfrid's life.<ref name=Brooks53>Brooks ''Early History of the Church of Canterbury'' p. 53</ref> However, according to [[Byrhtferth]]'s ''Vita Sancti Oswaldi'', or ''Life of Saint Oswald'', Oda's nephew, [[Oswald of Worcester|Oswald, Archbishop of York]], preserved the relics at Ripon and restored the community there to care for them.<ref name=DNB/> The two differing accounts are not easily reconciled, but it is possible that Oswald collected secondary relics that had been overlooked by his uncle and installed those at Ripon.<ref name=Thacker254>Thacker "Saint-making and Relic Collecting" ''St Oswald of Worcester'' pp. 254<U+2013>255</ref>{{#tag:ref|The early 12th century writer Eadmer, who wrote a ''Life of Wilfrid'', took this approach to the problem of the differing accounts of Wilfrid's relics, and appears to have been the first writer to suggest this solution.<ref name=Philpott101>Philpott "Eadmer, his Archbishops and the English State" ''Medieval State'' p. 101</ref>|group=notes}} The relics that were held at Canterbury were originally placed in the High Altar in 948, but after the fire at Canterbury Cathedral in 1067, Wilfrid's relics were placed in their own shrine.<ref name=Shrines64>Nilson ''Cathedral Shrines'' p. 64</ref>

After the [[Norman conquest of England|Norman Conquest of England]], devotion continued to be paid to Wilfrid, with 48&nbsp;churches dedicated to him and relics distributed between 11&nbsp;sites.<ref name=DNB/> During the 19th century, the feast of Wilfrid was celebrated on the Sunday following [[Lammas]] in the town of Ripon with a parade and horse racing, a tradition which continued until at least 1908.<ref name=Feast>"Feast of St Wilfrid" ''Folklore'' pp. 464<U+2013>466</ref> He is venerated in the Roman Catholic Church, Eastern Orthodox Church<ref name=Walsh623/> and the Anglican Communion.<ref name=OBD411>Holford-Strevens, et al. ''Oxford Book of Days'' pp. 411<U+2013>412</ref> He is usually depiction either as a bishop preaching and baptizing or else as a robed bishop holding an episcopal staff.<ref name=ODS536>Farmer ''Oxford Dictionary of Saints'' pp. 536-538</ref>

Wilfrid was one of the first bishops to bring relics of saints back from Rome. The papacy was trying to prevent the removal of actual body parts from Rome, restricting collectors to things that had come in contact with the bodily remains such as dust and cloth.<ref name=Ortenberg45>Ortenberg "The Anglo-Saxon Church and the Papacy" ''The English Church and the Papacy in the Middle Ages'' p. 45</ref> Wilfrid was known as an advocate of Benedictine monasticism,<ref name=Cubitt277/> and regarded it as a tool in his efforts to "root out the poisonous weeds planted by the Scots".<ref name=QMonasticism57>Quoted in Lawrence ''Medieval Monasticism'' p. 57</ref> He built at Ripon and Hexham, and lived a majestic lifestyle.<ref name=Monasticism57/> As a result of his various exiles, he founded monastic communities that were widely scattered over the British Isles, over which he kept control until his death.<ref name=Conversion163>Yorke ''Conversion of Britain'' p. 163</ref> These monastic foundations, especially Hexham, contributed to the blending of the Gaelic and Roman strains of Christianity in Northumbria, which inspired a great surge of learning and missionary activity; Bede and Alcuin were among the scholars who emerged from Northumbrian monasteries influenced by Wilfrid. Missionaries inspired by his example went from Northumbria to the continent, where they converted pagans in Germany and elsewhere.<ref name=Northumbria155>Higham ''Kingdom of Northumbria'' pp. 155<U+2013>156</ref>

One commentator has said that Wilfrid "came into conflict with almost every prominent secular and ecclesiastical figure of the age".<ref name=QHindley62>Quoted in Hindley ''A Brief History of the Anglo-Saxons'' p. 62</ref> Hindley, a historian of the Anglo-Saxons, states that "Wilfrid would not win his sainthood through the Christian virtue of humility".<ref name=Hindley78/> The historian Barbara Yorke said of him that "Wilfrid's character was such that he seems to have been able to attract and infuriate in equal measure".<ref name=Conversion163/> His contemporary, Bede, although a partisan of the Roman dating of Easter, was a monk and always treats Wilfrid a little uneasily, showing some concern about how Wilfrid conducted himself as a clergyman and as a bishop.<ref name=Brown363>Brown ''Rise of Western Christendom'' Second Edition pp. 363<U+2013>364</ref> The historian Eric John feels that it was Wilfrid's devotion to monasticism that led him to believe that the only way for the Church to be improved was through monasticism. John traces Wilfrid's many appeals to Rome to his motivation to hold together his monastic empire, rather than to self-interest. John also challenges the belief that Wilfrid was fond of pomp, pointing out that the comparison between the Irish missionaries who walked and Wilfrid who rode ignores the reality that the quickest method of travel in the Middle Ages was on horseback.<ref name=Reassess35>John ''Reassessing Anglo-Saxon England'' pp. 35<U+2013>37</ref>

The historian [[Peter Hunter Blair]] summarises Wilfrid's life as follows: "Wilfrid left a distinctive mark on the character of the English church in the seventh century. He was not a humble man, nor, so far as we can see, was he a man greatly interested in learning, and perhaps he would have been more at home as a member of the Gallo-Roman episcopate where the wealth which gave him enemies in England would have passed unnoticed and where his interference in matters of state would have been less likely to take him to prison."<ref name=World152>Blair ''World of Bede'' p. 152</ref> [[Richard Southern|R. W. Southern]], another modern historian, says that Wilfrid was "the greatest papal enthusiast of the century".<ref name=West57>Southern ''Western Society'' pp. 57<U+2013>58</ref> James Campbell, a historian specialising in the Anglo-Saxon period, said of him "He was certainly one of the greatest ecclesiastics of his day. Ascetic, deemed a saint by some, the founder of several monasteries according to the rule of St Benedict, he established Christianity in Sussex and attempted to do so in Frisia. At the same time, his life and conduct were in some respects like those of a great Anglo-Saxon nobleman."<ref name=Bede116>Campbell "Bede I" ''Essays in Anglo-Saxon History'' p. 16</ref>
