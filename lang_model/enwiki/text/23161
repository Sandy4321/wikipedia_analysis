'''The Partisans''' is a 1979 sculpture by the [[Polish-American]] sculptor [[Andrzej Pitynski]] that has been exhibited in Boston since 1983.

==Description==
The sculpture is 10 meters long, 7 meters high, and 4 meters wide.<ref name=doomed>http://www.doomedsoldiers.com/destruction-of-national-military-union-detatchment-pt3.html</ref> This modern aluminum sculpture depicts five riders and their horses. The horsemen carry spears on their back, and with their bower heads the sculpture intends to convey the themes of crucifixion and sacrifice.<ref name=bpa>http://www.publicartboston.com/content/partisans</ref> According to its creator they are intended to represent "five armed riders in a marching formation; five desperate men who resemble forest ghosts more than they resemble human beings... five partisans who are tattered, mortally tired, who are bleeding from endless battles, escapes, skirmishes... immersed with their own thoughts about the tragedy of their nation, who are riding their horses, stumbling from exhaustion".<ref name=doomed/>

The sculpture is a symbolic representation of the [[anti-communist resistance in Poland|anti-communist Polish partisans]] (known as [[cursed soldiers]]) following the [[History of Poland (1945-1989)|communist takeover of Poland]] in the [[aftermath of World War II]]<ref name=bpa/> (and not, as some<ref name=bpa/><ref>http://www.boston.com/news/local/articles/2006/09/02/partisans_sculpture_is_given_a_new_home/</ref> sources erroneously suggest, [[Polish resistance in World War II|World War II era anti-Nazi Polish partisans]]). The sculptor however dedicated his work to "all [[freedom fighters]] around the world".<ref name=viapolonia>http://www.viapolonia.net/bost_petition_jan_06/id8.htm</ref>

{{cquote|''I was creating 'The Partisans' in the United States, when Poland was changing, when the SB was murdering priests, students, and workers. I was creating this monument thinking about them all, about those thousands of the bravest Sons and Daughters of the Polish Nation, who were the first to stand up to the Soviet communism. They were betrayed by world and forgotten by God - a choice they made themselves - in the forest units of: NOW, AK, WiN, NSZ. They fought bravely with NKVD, Soviet Red Army; and with Polish traitors from the UB, KBW, MO, ORMO, [with all] 'consolidators of the people's [communist] regime. They fought because they never reconciled to give up their freedom. [They were] hunted in the forests like wild beasts, they were tortured in the UB dungeons, they were abused with the vindictive pleasure [of their oppressors], they were murdered in the MO torture houses, were buried illicitly at night in the graves that are unknown to this day. It is for THEM, that I created this symbol of the Golgotha of Polish Heroes.''<ref name=doomed/> --Andrzej Pitynski}}

==History==
Pitynski designed the sculpture in 1979 for the [[Johnson Atelier - The Technical Institute of Sculpture]], with financial support from the Sculpture Foundation.<ref name=viapolonia/><ref name=doomed/> According to the sculptor, it was controversial at first, as he has received threats from the symphatizers of the then-communist [[People's Republic of Poland]].<ref name=viapolonia/>

The sculpture has been displayed in Boston since 1983.<ref name=bpa/> At first it has been given to the city for temporary display, but has since became a permanent monument.<ref name=bpa/> Until January 2006 the statue was located in the [[Boston Commons]] area, near the corner of Charles and Beacon streets. City officials cited concerns that the statue lacked proper pedestal and stored it in a warehouse, which triggered protests from Polish-American community, and from the sculptor himself.<ref name=mbta/><ref>http://www.boston.com/news/local/articles/2006/03/06/seeking_common_ground_150_march_for_statues_return/</ref><ref name=viapolonia/> In July that year the statue has been moved to a new public location, thanks to assistance of the [[Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority]] (MBTA).<ref name=mbta/> It is now located at [[South Boston]] waterfront near the [[Institute of Contemporary Art, Boston|Boston Institute of Contemporary Art]] and the MBTA]s [[World Trade Center (MBTA station)|World Trade Center Station]] on the [[Silver Line (MBTA)|Silver Line]].<ref name=bpa/><ref name=mbta>http://www.mbta.com/about_the_mbta/news_events/?id=6708&month=9&year=06</ref> Re-unveiling of the statue in the presence of [[Polonia]] community, local authority officials and politicians, has been endorsed by the sculptor, Andrzej Pitynski, and by the Polish Consulate in Boston.<ref name=mbta/><ref>http://www.viapolonia.net/bost_petition_jan_06/</ref>
