'''Ben's Chili Bowl''' is a landmark [[restaurant]] in [[Washington, D.C.]], located at 1213 [[U Street Corridor|U Street]], next to [[Lincoln Theatre (Washington, D.C.)|Lincoln Theatre]], in the [[Shaw, Washington, D.C.|Shaw]] neighborhood of [[Washington, D.C. (northwest)|northwest]] D.C. It is known locally for its [[chili dog]]s, [[half-smoke]]s, and [[milkshake]]s, and has been an integral part of the neighborhood's history since its founding in 1958. It was frequented by both police and protesters during the [[1968 Washington, D.C. riots]], and is regularly visited by celebrities such as [[Bill Cosby]] and [[Chris Tucker]]. The restaurant's founders have been inducted into the D.C. Hall of Fame.

== History ==
Ben's Chili Bowl was founded in 1958 by husband and wife team Ben and Virginia Ali.<ref>{{cite news |title=The Bottomless Bowl of U Street; A Neighborhood Institution Prepares to Celebrate 45 Years of Chili -- and Change |work=The Washington Post |date=2003-08-21 |last=Wilgoren |first=Debbi}}</ref>  The building they chose was that of Washington's first [[silent movie]] house, the Minnehaha, which was established in 1911.<ref name=PBS>[http://www.pbs.org/ellingtonsdc/vtOtherLandMarks.htm#Chili Virtual Duke Ellington's Washington: Tour of Shaw: Ben's Chili Bowl], [[PBS]]</ref>  Most of the furniture in the restaurant is original to the 1950s.<ref name=Globe>Vorhees, Mara, [http://www.boston.com/ae/food/articles/2004/01/28/bens_chili_and_hot_dogs_have_time_tested_appeal/  Ben's chili and hot dogs have time-tested appeal], [[Boston Globe]], [[28 January]] [[2004]]</ref>  At the time, Washington was officially [[Racial segregation|segregated]], and U Street was known as "Black [[Broadway (New York City)|Broadway]]."  Many [[jazz]] greats of the day, such as [[Duke Ellington]], [[Miles Davis]], and [[Nat King Cole]], would stop by the restaurant when they performed at U Street clubs.

The U Street corridor was devastated by the [[1968 Washington, DC riots|1968 riots]] that followed the assassination of [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]]<ref name=CNN>[http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0308/22/se.03.html Transcript: Ben's Chili Bowl Celebrates 45th Anniversary], [[CNN]], aired [[22 August]] [[2003]]</ref>  During the riots black activist [[Stokely Carmichael]], leader of the [[Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee]], asked Ben to keep his restaurant open and the Alis obtained permission to stay open past [[curfew]].  The restaurant fed both the police officers and firemen working to impose order on the neighborhood, as well as the black activists.  The violence and arson reached such an extent that Ben wrote "Soul Brother" in soap on the front window in the hopes that it would stop the angry mobs.<ref name=BusinessWeek>{{cite news |url=http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/05_49/b3962460.htm |title=Ben Ali's Way |author= Kamal Ali as told to Gay Jervey |work=[[BusinessWeek]] |date=Winter 2005}}</ref>  The destruction of so many businesses led to the flight of residents towards the suburbs and the economic decline of the neighborhood through the mid-1970s to mid-1980s.  As the area became known for its [[drug addiction|drug addicts]], Ben's Chili Bowl reduced its staff to one employee.<ref name=CNN/>  Ben and Virginia's son Kamal recalled, "We stayed and had a following, because the Chili Bowl was like the neighborhood [[barbershop]]. People would sit here and chat. There was always a family presence and the locals protected us."<ref name=BusinessWeek/>

The vast construction of the [[U Street/African-American Civil War Memorial/Cardozo (Washington Metro)|U Street/Cardozo Metro Station]] across the street from the restaurant, completed in 1991, forced still more U Street businesses to close, but Ben's Chili Bowl stayed open to feed the construction workers.<ref name=Globe/> ''[[The Washington Post]]'' commented that Ben's Chili Bowl is "probably the only business on this strip that survived both the 1968 riots and the construction phase of the [[Green Line (Washington Metro)|Metro Green Line]]."<ref name=WaPo>Becton, Neal, [http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn?node=cityguide/profile&id=792153 City Guide: Ben's Chili Bowl], ''[[Washington Post]]'' editorial review</ref>  The Metro and lower crime rates helped the gradual revitalization and [[gentrification]] of the neighborhood.  From the early 1990s, business revenues grew by 10% annually, to $1.5 million in 2005, and the number of employees at the restaurant grew as well, to a staff of 20.<ref name=BusinessWeek/>  In 2001, Ben and Virginia's son commented on the changes: "You hear comments.  Even the white customers. They want to think they're the only whites who'd been hip enough to go to the Chili Bowl. Now they look around and there are a lot of other whites and they are not so happy about it."<ref>[http://news.independent.co.uk/world/americas/article226978.ece "City Life: Washington"] by Andrew Buncombe, '[[The Independent]]'', [[4 June]] [[2001]]</ref>  In 2007, the Chili Bowl joined with nine other local businesses to buy [[Renewable Energy Certificates]] as part of a [[renewable energy]] initiative.<ref>[http://www.nytimes.com/2007/08/15/business/15wind.html?_r=1&fromrss=1&ex=1187755200&en=359c0cb8cc50bf57&ei=5099&partner=TOPIXNEWS&oref=slogin "Washington<U+2019>s Small Businesses Tap Into Green Power"] by Shawn Kennedy, ''[[The New York Times]]'', [[15 August]] [[2007]]</ref>  [[As of 2007]], Ben and Virginia have retired from the restaurant business and have passed daily operations of Ben's Chili Bowl to their sons, Kamal and Nizam.<ref>[http://www.benschilibowl.com/navNS4.html Ben's Chili Bowl website]</ref>

In 2008, Ben's Chili Bowl opened a second location in the newly built [[Nationals Park]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.benschilibowl.com/news.html |title=Ben's Chili Bowl News |accessdate=2008-05-26}}</ref>
