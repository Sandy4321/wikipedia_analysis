'''Gulielma Lister''' (28 October 1860 <U+2013> 18 May 1949) was a British [[botany|botanist]] and [[Mycology|mycologist]], and was considered an international authority on [[Mycetozoa]].<ref name=Ogilvie>{{cite book|last1=Ogilvie|first1=Marilyn Bailey|last2=Harvey|first2=Joy Dorothy|title=The Biographical Dictionary of Women in Science: L-Z|date=2000|publisher=Taylor & Francis|location=London|isbn=9780415920407|page=795}}</ref>

==Life==
Lister was born in Sycamore House, 881 High Road, Leytonstone on 28 October 1860, one of seven children of [[Arthur Lister|Arthur]] and Susanna Lister.<ref name=Ramsbottom>{{cite journal|last1=Ramsbottom|first1=J.|title=Miss Gulielma Lister|journal=Nature|date=1949|volume=164|pages=94-94|url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v164/n4159/abs/164094a0.html|accessdate=9 May 2015}}</ref><ref name=Creese /> Born into a prominent Quaker family, being the granddaughter of [[Joseph Jackson Lister (naturalist)|J.J. Lister]] and niece of [[Joseph Lister, 1st Baron Lister|Lord Lister]].<ref name="Wanstead Wildlife">{{cite web|title=Gulielma Lister 1860 -1949|url=http://www.wansteadwildlife.org.uk/index.php/home/list-of-places?id=118|website=Wanstead Wildlife|accessdate=9 May 2015}}</ref><ref name=Haskins>{{cite journal|last1=Haskins|first1=E.F.|title=Miss Gulielma Lister F.L.S. remembered|journal=Mycologist|date=1999|volume=13|issue=2|pages=54<U+2013>56}}</ref> Lister was educated at home save for one year at [[Bedford College (London)|Bedford College for Women]].<ref name=Ramsbottom /> Lister's mother was a formally trained artist, which appears to have been part of Lister's home schooling.<ref name=Creese />

Lister spent her life in Leytonstone, and the family summer house in [[Lyme Regis]], where she conducted much of her field work.<ref name=Creese /> Lister died in the house she was born on 18 May 1949, and is commemorated at grave number 07 at the Quaker Meeting House in Bush Road where her ashes were scattered.<ref name="Wanstead Wildlife" />

==Botanical and mycological work==
Lister's interest in natural history was due to her father, who although a wine merchant, dedicated much of his time to the study of Mycetozoa.<ref name=Ogilvie /> She acted as his field and laboratory assistant in his work.<ref name=Haskins /> Lister helped her father in the compilation of his 1894 work ''Monograph of Mycetozoa'', going on to revise and expand the work with two further editions in 1911 and 1925.<ref name=Ogilvie /> Lister also appears to have begun working in the [[Natural History Museum, London|British Museum (NH)]] around this time, although she never held an official appointment, and was a contemporary of [[Annie Lorrain Smith]] and [[Ethel Barton]].<ref name=Creese>{{cite book|last1=Creese|first1=Mary R.

American and British Women in Science, 1800-1900: A Survey of Their Contributions to Research|date=2000|publisher=Scarecrow Press|location=Kent|isbn=9780585276847|pages=35-36}}</ref> She catalogued and studied botanical collections in [[Kew Gardens]], [[National Museum of Natural History (France)|Natural History Museum, Paris]], and the [[University of Strasbourg]].<ref name=Creese />
 
Lister was an active member of the [[British Mycological Society]] from 1903, being one of the first 100 founding members.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Obituary: Miss Gulielma Lister|journal=Transactions of the British Mycological Society|date=1950|volume=33|page=165}}</ref> She served as president in 1912 and 1932, and her dedication to the group was recognised in 1924 when she was made an honorary member.<ref name=Ogilvie /> She also served as President of the Essex Field Club from 1916-1919,<ref name="Wanstead Wildlife" /><ref name=Haskins /> becoming the first woman to hold the position.<ref name=Creese /> She was a fellow of the [[Linnean Society of London|Linnaean Society]], a council member (1915-1917, 1927-1931) and Vice-President (1929-1931).<ref name=Ogilvie /> From 1917 until her death, Lister was a trustee on the Botanical Research Fund, and was the chair of the School Nature Study Union for a number of years.<ref name=Haskins /> 

Lister corresponded with fellow mycologists from all over the world, including the [[Emperor of Japan]], who sent her a pair of enamel vases to thank her for her help in his studies.<ref name=Haskins /> To keep up to date with research Lister even learnt Polish so as to be able to read the work of [[J<U+00F3>sef Tomasz Rostafinski]] in the study of British and European [[Myxogastria]].<ref name=Creese /> Lister also had an interest in other animals, including birds and coniferous trees. She provided the illustrations for [[William Dallimore|Dallimore]] and [[Albert Bruce Jackson|Jackson's]] ''Handbook of Coniferae'' and F.J. Hanbury's ''Illustrated Monograph of the British Hieracia''.<ref name=Ogilvie />

Lister's collections can be found in the Natural History Museum, London and Kew Gardens.<ref name=Creese />
