'''Jack Sparrow''' is a [[fictional character]] from the ''[[Pirates of the Caribbean]]'' [[fictional universe|universe]] who is portrayed by [[Johnny Depp]]. He was introduced in the film ''[[Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl]]'' ([[2003 in film|2003]]), and appeared in the back-to-back sequels, ''[[Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest|Dead Man's Chest]]'' ([[2006 in film|2006]]) and ''[[Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End|At World's End]]'' ([[2007 in film|2007]]). He is also the subject of a children's book series, ''[[Pirates of the Caribbean: Jack Sparrow]]'', which chronicles his adolescent years, and the character's image was introduced into the [[Pirates of the Caribbean (theme park ride)|theme park ride]] that inspired the films when it was revamped in 2006. The character has also appeared in numerous video games.

Sparrow is the [[Brethren Court|Pirate Lord of the Caribbean Sea]] and can be treacherous, surviving mostly by using wit and negotiation rather than weapons and force; although he will fight if necessary, he tries to flee most dangerous situations. Sparrow is introduced seeking to regain his ship the ''[[Black Pearl]]'' from his mutinous first mate [[Hector Barbossa]] in the first film, and in the sequels, attempts to escape his blood debt to the legendary [[Davy Jones (Pirates of the Caribbean)|Davy Jones]] while battling the [[East India Trading Company]].

Initially, Sparrow was conceived for the first film as a [[trickster]] who guides the hero, [[Will Turner]] ([[Orlando Bloom]]), but Johnny Depp's performance led to Sparrow's role being altered. Depp's flamboyant and [[Eccentricity (behavior)|eccentric]] characterization, partially inspired by [[Pep<U+00E9> Le Pew]] and [[Keith Richards]], turned Sparrow into an iconic [[anti-hero]] and the [[breakout character]] of the series. Depp earned his first [[Academy Award]] nomination, and in a case of life imitating art, Richards played a cameo role as [[Brethren Court#Teague|Sparrow's father]] in the third film.

==Appearances==
===Film trilogy===
Jack Sparrow first appears in ''[[Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl]]'' (2003), where he arrives in [[Port Royal]] looking to commandeer a ship. Despite rescuing [[Elizabeth Swann]] ([[Keira Knightley]]), the daughter of [[Weatherby Swann|Governor Weatherby Swann]] ([[Jonathan Pryce]]) from drowning, he is jailed for piracy. That night, the ghost ship, the ''[[Black Pearl]]'' attacks Port Royal and gets entangled in an epic battle with Captian Travis Walls, who [[Hector Barbossa|Captain Barbossa]] ([[Geoffrey Rush]]) believes can break an ancient Aztec curse he and the crew are under. [[Will Turner]] ([[Orlando Bloom]]), a [[blacksmith]] who loves Elizabeth, frees Sparrow to aid him in rescuing her. They steal the HMS ''Interceptor'' and acquire a crew in [[Tortuga]] before heading to [[Isla de Muerta]], where Elizabeth is being held captive. They are quickly captured, and Barbossa maroons Sparrow and Elizabeth on the same island where Sparrow, the ''Black Pearl's'' former captain, had previously been stranded, with only a pistol and one shot, when Barbossa and the crew had mutinied. The island had been used by [[rum-running|rum-runners]], which on Sparrow's first marooning had allowed him to bargain for rescue; over the years, a tall tale evolved that he escaped on two [[sea turtle]]s he lashed together with hair from his back.<ref name="curse">{{cite video | people = [[Gore Verbinski]] (director) | title = [[Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl]] | format = [[Film]] | publisher = [[Walt Disney Pictures]] | year = [[2003 in film|2003]]}}</ref>
[[Image:Jack Sparrow -5.JPG|thumb|left|150px|Sparrow steps back into the moonlight, revealing his cursed form]]

This time, however, Sparrow discovers that the rum runners had abandoned the island. Elizabeth uses the rum to start a fire, and the pair are rescued by the British [[Royal Navy]]. In order to escape hanging, Sparrow makes a deal to deliver them the ''Black Pearl''. During the film's final battle at Isla de Muerta, Sparrow steals a cursed coin, making himself immortal so he can fight Barbossa. He shoots his rival with the same shot he has carried for ten years just as Will breaks the curse, killing Barbossa. The Royal Navy captures the surviving pirates, including Sparrow, who is later sentenced to death. At his scheduled execution in Port Royal, Will comes to his rescue, but they are quickly caught. Governor Swann and Commodore Norrington are reluctant to resume the hanging, however, and Will is pardoned, while Sparrow escapes by falling off the sea wall. He is rescued by the ''Black Pearl'' crew, and made captain once more. Apparently impressed by the clever pirate, Commodore [[James Norrington]] ([[Jack Davenport]]) allows him one day's head start before giving chase.<ref name="curse"/> 

In the sequel ''[[Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest]]'' (2006), Sparrow searches for the [[Dead Man's Chest (Pirates of the Caribbean)|Dead Man's Chest]]. Thirteen years earlier, Sparrow bartered his soul to [[Davy Jones (Pirates of the Caribbean)|Captain Davy Jones]] ([[Bill Nighy]]) in return for Jones raising the sunken ''Black Pearl'' and making Sparrow captain. In the film, Sparrow must either serve for 100 years aboard the ''[[The Flying Dutchman (Pirates of the Caribbean)|Flying Dutchman]]'', or be taken by the [[Kraken (Pirates of the Caribbean)|Kraken]] to [[Davy Jones<U+2019>s Locker (Pirates of the Caribbean)|Davy Jones<U+2019>s Locker]]. Sparrow learns the Dead Man's Chest contains Jones<U+2019>s heart&mdash;stabbing it will kill Jones and free Sparrow from his blood debt. Adding to Sparrow's woes, [[Lord Cutler Beckett]] ([[Tom Hollander]]) of the [[East India Trading Company]] wants to settle his own debt with Sparrow and forces Will Turner to search for him. Will finds Sparrow and his crew hiding from the Kraken on [[Pelegosto]] where they have been captured by cannibals. They escape, but Sparrow betrays Will to Davy Jones as part of a new deal to deliver 100 souls in exchange for his own. Sparrow recruits sailors in Tortuga where he unexpectedly encounters Elizabeth and the disgraced James Norrington. Convincing Elizabeth she can free Will by finding the Chest, they head for [[Isla Cruces]] after she pinpoints its location with Jack's compass- an enchanted compass that points to the thing its possessor desires most. Will also arrives, having escaped Jones<U+2019>s ship after stealing the key to the Chest. Will wants to stab the heart and free his father who is in Jones<U+2019>s service, while Norrington- who has discovered Lord Cutler Beckett desires the heart in order to control Davy Jones, and thus also control the seas- hopes to regain his career by delivering said heart to Beckett. Sparrow fears if Jones is dead, the Kraken will continue hunting him. Jones<U+2019>s crew arrives, and during the ensuing battle, Norrington steals the heart. Jones summons the Kraken to attack the ''Black Pearl''. Realizing that the Kraken only wants Sparrow, Elizabeth tricks him by giving him a passionate kiss while chaining him to the mast to save the crew; Sparrow and the ship are dragged down to Davy Jones<U+2019>s Locker.<ref name="chest">{{cite video | people = [[Gore Verbinski]] (director) | title = [[Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest]] | format = [[Film]] | publisher = [[Walt Disney Pictures]] | year = [[2006 in film|2006]]}}</ref>
[[Image:Jack VS.. The Kraken.JPG|thumb|200px|Sparrow faces the Kraken as he is dragged down to Davy Jones<U+2019>s Locker]]

''[[Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End]]'' (2007), opens with Davy Jones<U+2019>s heart now in Beckett's possession, and the nine pirate lords of the [[Brethren Court]] are summoned to convene at Shipwreck Cove to combat the combined threat of Beckett and Jones. Though taken to Davy Jones<U+2019>s Locker at the end of the previous film, Sparrow, who is the Pirate Lord of the Caribbean, must attend the meeting, as he failed to bequeath his "[[Pieces of Eight (piracy)|piece of eight]]", a pirate lord's identification marker, to an heir. The collective "pieces of eight" can summon the sea goddess [[Calypso (Pirates of the Caribbean)|Calypso]]. A resurrected Barbossa leads Sparrow's crew to Davy Jones<U+2019>s Locker using the Singaporean pirate lord Sao Feng's navigational charts. There Sparrow has been hallucinating an entire crew comprised of himself, each representing a facet of his personality. After [[Hector Barbossa|Barbossa]] and the crew find him, Sparrow deciphers a clue on the charts that indicates they must capsize the ''Black Pearl'' to escape the Locker; at sunset, the ship upturns back into the living world. Sparrow and Barbossa journey to the Brethren Court where they encounter Elizabeth, who was traded to Sao Feng, and was made a Pirate Lord by him just before he died. At the Brethren Court, she is elected "Pirate King" after Sparrow breaks a stalemate (the other lords always voted for themselves). During [[parley]], he is traded for Will, who was captured by Jones and Beckett. The ''Black Pearl'' and the ''Flying Dutchman'' face off in battle during a [[maelstrom]] created by Calypso, Sparrow steals Davy Jones<U+2019>s heart to become immortal, but when Jones mortally wounds Will, Sparrow instead helps Will stab the heart, killing Jones and making Will the ''Flying Dutchman'''s new captain. Together, the ''Black Pearl'' and the ''Flying Dutchman'' destroy Beckett's ship. At the end of the film Barbossa again commandeers the ''Black Pearl'' and Feng's charts, stranding Sparrow in Tortuga. Fortunately, Sparrow has already removed the chart's center, and he sets sail in a small boat, using his compass and the chart to guide him to the [[Fountain of Youth]].<ref name="world">{{cite video | people = [[Gore Verbinski]] (director) | title = [[Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End]] | format = [[Film]] | publisher = [[Walt Disney Pictures]] | year = [[2007 in film|2007]]}}</ref>

===Tie-ins===
Outside films, Jack Sparrow first appeared as a companion character in the 2005 video game ''[[Kingdom Hearts II]]'', where he was voiced by [[James Arnold Taylor]] in the English version and [[Hiroaki Hirata]] in the Japanese version. Sparrow has since appeared in other video games, ''[[Pirates of the Caribbean: The Legend of Jack Sparrow]]'' where he was voiced by [[Johnny Depp]], the adaptation of ''[[Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest (video game)|Dead Man's Chest]]'' and various game versions of ''[[Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End (video game)|At World's End]]'', where he was voiced by Jared Butler. The character is also set to appear in ''[[Pirates of the Caribbean Online]]'', which takes place before the films.

Sparrow's backstory in ''Pirates of the Caribbean: The Complete Visual Guide'' indicates he was born on a pirate ship during a [[typhoon]] in the [[Indian Ocean]], and that he was trained to fence by an Italian.<ref>{{cite book | author = Richard Platt | coauthor = Glenn Dakin | title = Pirates of the Caribbean: The Complete Visual Guide | publisher = [[Dorling Kindersley]] | date = 2007 | pages = 12-15 | id = ISBN 0756626765}}</ref> [[Rob Kidd]] wrote an ongoing book series entitled ''[[Pirates of the Caribbean: Jack Sparrow]]'', following a teenage Sparrow and his crew on the ''Barnacle'' as they battle [[sirens]], [[mermaids]] and adult pirates while looking for various treasures. The first book, ''The Coming Storm'', was published on [[June 1]] [[2006]]. On the website for ''[[Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest]]'', it is explained that Sparrow once worked for the [[East India Trading Company]] and captained the ''Wicked Wench''. When he refused to transport [[African slave trade|slaves]], he was branded a pirate and his ship was ordered sunk by Lord Cutler Beckett, a company agent. Sparrow then bargained with Davy Jones to raise his ship, which he rechristened the ''Black Pearl''.<ref name="wench">{{cite web | title = Black Pearl 101 | publisher = [[Walt Disney Pictures]] | url = http://adisney.go.com/disneyvideos/liveaction/pirates2/games/gameshell.html?bp101 | accessdate=2007-05-31}}</ref>

==Concept and creation==
===Character creation===
When writing the screenplay for ''[[Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl]]'', [[Ted Elliott]] and [[Terry Rossio]] envisioned Jack Sparrow as a supporting character, citing [[Bugs Bunny]] and [[Groucho Marx]] as influences.<ref name="writers curse"/> The producers saw him as a young [[Burt Lancaster]].<ref name="depp gold">{{cite news | author = Sean Smith | title = A Pirate's Life | publisher = [[Newsweek]] | date = [[2006-06-26]] | url = http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/13391041/site/newsweek/page/3/ | accessdate=2007-05-30}}</ref> Director [[Gore Verbinski]] admitted, "The first film was a movie, and then Jack was put into it almost. He doesn't have the obligations of the plot in the same ways that the other characters have. He meanders his way through, and he kind of affects everybody else."<ref name="chest verb">{{cite news | author = Jeff Otto | title = IGN Interviews Gore Verbinski | publisher = [[IGN]] | date = [[2006-06-28]] | url = http://uk.movies.ign.com/articles/714/714964p1.html | accessdate=2007-05-31}}</ref> Sparrow represents an ethical [[pirate]], with [[Captain Barbossa]] as his corrupt [[foil (literature)|foil]].<ref name="writers curse">{{cite video | people = [[Ted Elliott]], [[Terry Rossio]], [[Stuart Beattie]], [[Jay Wolpert]] | title = Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl: Audio Commentary | format = DVD | publisher = Buena Vista | year = 2003}}</ref> His true motives usually remain masked, and whether he is honorable or evil depends on the audience's perspective.<ref>{{cite web | title = Shipload of Characters Both New and Familiar | publisher = ''Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest'' Production Notes | url = http://madeinatlantis.com/pirates/production/production3.htm | accessdate=2007-05-31}}</ref> This acts as part of [[Will Turner]]'s arc, in which Sparrow tells him a pirate can be a good man, like [[Bootstrap Bill Turner|his father]].<ref name="writers curse"/>

Following the success of ''The Curse of the Black Pearl'', the challenge to creating a sequel was, according to Verbinski, "You don't want just the Jack Sparrow movie. It's like having a garlic milkshake. He's the spice and you need a lot of straight men....Let's not give them too much Jack. It's like too much dessert or too much of a good thing."<ref name="chest verb"/> Although ''[[Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest|Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest's]]'' was written to propel the trilogy's plot,<ref name="desperate"/> Sparrow's state-of-mind as he is pursued by [[Davy Jones (Pirates of the Caribbean)|Davy Jones]] becomes increasingly edgy, and the writers concocted the cannibal sequence to show that he was in danger whether on land or sea. Sparrow is also perplexed over his attraction to [[Elizabeth Swann]], and attempts to justify it throughout the film.<ref name="writers chest"/> 

''[[Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End]]'' was meant to return it tonally to a [[character piece]]. Sparrow, in particular, is tinged with madness after extended [[solitary confinement]] in [[Davy Jones<U+2019>s Locker (Pirates of the Caribbean)|Davy Jones<U+2019>s Locker]],<ref name="desperate">{{cite news | author = Ian Nathan | title = Pirates 3 | publisher = [[Empire (magazine)|Empire]] | pages = 88-92 | date = [[2007-04-27]] | accessdate=2007-05-02}}</ref> and now desires [[immortality]].<ref name="immortality">{{cite web | title = Characters (video) | publisher = Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End Official site | url = http://disney.go.com/disneypictures/pirates/atworldsend/ | accessdate=2007-05-31}}</ref> Sparrow struggles with what it takes to be a moral person,<ref name="success"/> after his honest streak caused his doom in the second film.<ref>{{cite web | title = Chapter 3 - Revealing the True Nature of all the Characters | publisher = ''Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End'' Production Notes | url = http://numberonestars.com/pirates3/production3.htm | accessdate=2007-06-02}}</ref> By the end of ''At World's End'' Sparrow is sailing to the [[Fountain of Youth]], an early concept for the second film.<ref>{{cite video | title = Charting the Return | format = DVD | publisher = [[Buena Vista (Walt Disney Company)|Buena Vista]] | year = 2006}}</ref> Rossio has said they may write the screenplay for a fourth film,<ref>{{cite news | title = Exclusive interview: Terry Rossio | publisher = Moviehole | date = [[2007-02-12]] | url = http://www.moviehole.net/interviews/20070212_exclusive_interview_terry_ross.html | accessdate = 2007-02-12}}</ref> and producer [[Jerry Bruckheimer]] has expressed interest in a [[spin-off]].<ref>{{cite news | title = Pirates of the Caribbean 4 Might Be a Spin-Off | publisher = [[USA Today]] | date = [[2007-05-10]] | url = http://asp.usatoday.com/community/othervoices/default.aspx?news&bbPostId=B67Sc04QhxD4BD3SVECZ8QgwBA4PCPjrYY9QCzB9cbZHV3b4G&req=blogburst&tag=news | accessdate=2007-05-10}}</ref> Gore Verbinski concurred that "all of the stories set in motion by the first film have been resolved.

===Johnny Depp===
[[Johnny Depp]] was looking to do a [[family film]] in 2001, and was visiting [[Walt Disney Studios (Burbank)|Walt Disney Studios]] when he heard there were plans to adapt the ''[[Pirates of the Caribbean (theme park ride)|Pirates of the Caribbean]]'' ride into a film. Depp was excited by the possibility of reviving an old Hollywood genre,<ref name="depp gold"/> and was further delighted that the script met his quirky sensibilities: the crew of the ''[[Black Pearl]]'' were not searching for treasure, but were instead trying to return it to lift their curse. In addition, the traditional [[mutiny]] had already occurred.<ref name="depp commentary">{{cite video | people = [[Gore Verbinski]], [[Johnny Depp]] | title = Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl Audio Commentary | format = [[DVD]] | publisher = [[Buena Vista (Walt Disney Company)|Buena Vista]] | year = 2003}}</ref> Depp was cast on [[June 10]] [[2002]].<ref>{{cite web | author = Greg Dean Schmitz | title = Greg's Previews - Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl (2003) | publisher = [[Yahoo!]] | url = http://movies.yahoo.com/shop?d=hp&cf=prev&id=1808405416&gpt=ch | accessdate=2007-05-31}}</ref> Producer [[Jerry Bruckheimer]] felt Depp was, "an edgy actor who will kind of counter the Disney ''Country Bears'' soft quality and tell an audience that an adult and teenager can go see this and have a good time with it."<ref name="talk"/>

At the first [[read-through]], Depp surprised the cast and crew by portraying the character in an off-kilter manner.<ref name="cocky">{{cite news | author = Ian Nathan | title = Pirates of the Caribbean 2 | pages = 66-69 | publisher = [[Empire (magazine)|Empire]] | date = [[2006-07-01]] | accessdate=2007-05-13}}</ref> After researching 18th century pirates, Depp compared them to modern rock stars and decided to base his performance on [[Keith Richards]].<ref name="talk">{{cite news | author=Stax | title = Depp & Bruckheimer Talk Pirates | publisher = [[IGN]] | date = [[2003-06-25]] | url = http://uk.movies.ign.com/articles/425/425848p1.html | accessdate=2007-05-31}}</ref> Verbinski and Bruckheimer had confidence in Depp, partly because [[Orlando Bloom]] would be playing the traditional [[Errol Flynn]]-type character.<ref name="depp commentary"/> Depp also improvised the film's final line, "Bring me that horizon!", which is the writer's favorite line.<ref name="cocky"/> Disney executives were initially confused by Depp's performance, asking him whether the character was [[drunk]] or [[gay]]. [[Michael Eisner]] even proclaimed while watching rushes, "He's ruining the film!"<ref name="cocky"/> Depp responded, "Look, these are the choices I made. You know my work. So either trust me or give me the boot."<ref name="talk"/> Many industry insiders also questioned Depp's casting, as he was an unconventional actor not known for working within the traditional studio system.<ref>{{cite news | author = Chris Nashawaty | title = Box Office Buccaneer | publisher = [[Entertainment Weekly]] | url = http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20037288_20037290_465481,00.html | accessdate=2007-05-18}}</ref>

Depp's performance was highly acclaimed by film critics. Alan Morrison found it, "Gloriously over-the-top... In terms of physical precision and verbal delivery, it's a master-class in comedy acting."<ref>{{cite news | author = Alan Morrison | title = Pirates Of The Caribbean: The Curse Of The Black Pearl | publisher = [[Empire (magazine)|Empire]] | url = http://www.empireonline.com/reviews/reviewcomplete.asp?FID=9271 | accessdate=2007-05-21}}</ref> [[Roger Ebert]] also found his performance, "original in its every atom. There has never been a pirate, or for that matter a human being, like this in any other movie....his behavior shows a lifetime of rehearsal." Ebert also praised Depp for drawing away from the way the character was written.<ref>{{cite news | author = [[Roger Ebert]] | title = Pirates Of The Caribbean: The Curse Of The Black Pearl | publisher = [[Chicago Sun-Times]] | date = [[2003-07-09]] | url = http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20030709/REVIEWS/307090301/1023 | accessdate=2007-05-21}}</ref> Although he disliked the film, critic [[Kenneth Turan]] enjoyed Depp's performance,<ref>{{cite news | author = [[Kenneth Turan]] | title = 'Pirates of the Caribbean' | publisher = [[Los Angeles Times]] | url = http://www.calendarlive.com/movies/reviews/cl-et-turan9jul09,2,3211342.story | accessdate=2007-05-21}}</ref> but [[Mark Kermode]] wrote it was some of Depp's "worst work to date... under [director [[Gore Verbinski]]]'s slack direction Depp defaults to an untrammelled showiness not seen since the sub-[[Buster Keaton]] antics of ''[[Benny & Joon]]''."<ref>{{cite news | author = [[Mark Kermode]] | title = Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest | publisher = [[The Observer]] | date = [[2006-07-09]] | url = http://film.guardian.co.uk/News_Story/Critic_Review/Guardian_Film_of_the_week/0,,1816109,00.html | accessdate=2007-05-31}}</ref> Depp won a [[Screen Actor's Guild]] award for his performance, and was also nominated for a [[Golden Globe]]<ref>{{cite web | title = Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl Awards | publisher = [[All Movie Guide]] | url = http://www.allmovie.com/cg/avg.dll?p=avg&sql=1:281052~T4 | accessdate=2007-05-31}}</ref> and an [[Academy Award]], the first in his career.<ref name="farewell?">{{cite news | title = Pirates World's End: Johnny Depp's Farewell? | publisher = Emanuel Levy | date = 2007 | url = http://www.emanuellevy.com/article.php?articleID=5729 | accessdate=2007-05-31}}</ref> ''Film School Rejects'' argued that because of the film, Depp became as much a [[movie star]] as he was a [[character actor]].<ref>{{cite news | author = Neil Miller | url = http://www.filmschoolrejects.com/opinions/the-ten-most-powerful-movie-franchises-in-history.php | title = The Ten Most Powerful Movie Franchises in History | publisher = Film School Rejects | url = http://www.filmschoolrejects.com/opinions/the-ten-most-powerful-movie-franchises-in-history.php | date = [[2007-05-29]] | accessdate=2007-05-31}}</ref>

Depp forgot to have them removed after shooting ''The Curse of the Black Pearl'',<ref>{{cite news | title = Depp's Golden Teeth | publisher = [[Internet Movie Database]] | date = [[2003-06-23]] | url = http://www.imdb.com/news/wenn/2003-06-23#celeb5 | accessdate=2007-05-21}}</ref> and decided to keep them throughout shooting of the sequels.<ref name="depp gold"/> Like all aspects of Depp's performance, Disney initially expressed great concern over Depp's teeth.<ref name="writers chest"/> Sparrow wears his goatee in two braids. Initially wire was used in them, but they were abandoned because they stuck up when Depp laid down.<ref>{{cite video | title = Jack's Beard | format = [[DVD]] | publisher = [[Buena Vista (Walt Disney Company)|Buena Vista]] | year = 2006}}</ref> Sparrow also has numerous tattoos,<ref name="world"/> and has been [[Human branding|branded]] a pirate on his right arm by [[Cutler Beckett]],<ref name="chest"/> underneath a tattoo of a [[sparrow]].<ref name="curse"/>

Depp collaborated with costume designer Penny Rose on his character's appearance, handpicking the [[tricorne]] as Sparrow's signature [[leather]] hat: the other characters in the series could not wear leather hats, to make Sparrow's unique. For the scene when it floats on water in ''Dead Man's Chest'', a rubber version was used.<ref name="hat">{{cite video | title = Jack's Hat | format = [[DVD]] | publisher = [[Buena Vista (Walt Disney Company)|Buena Vista]] | year = 2006}}</ref> Depp liked to stick to one costume, wearing one lightweight [[silk]] tweed coat throughout the series,<ref>{{cite video | title = Jack's Pirate Coat | format = [[DVD]] | publisher = [[Buena Vista (Walt Disney Company)|Buena Vista]] | year = 2006}}</ref> and he had to be coaxed out of wearing his boots for a version without a sole or heel in beach scenes.<ref>{{cite video | title = Jack's Boots | format = [[DVD]] | publisher = [[Buena Vista (Walt Disney Company)|Buena Vista]] | year = 2006}}</ref> None of the costumes from ''The Curse of the Black Pearl'' survived, which allowed the opportunity to create tougher linen shirts for stunts.<ref>{{cite video | title = Jack's Shirt | format = [[DVD]] | publisher = [[Buena Vista (Walt Disney Company)|Buena Vista]] | year = 2006}}</ref> It was a nightmare for Rose to track down the same makers of Sparrow's [[sash]] in [[Turkey]]. Rose did not want to [[silkscreen]] it, as the homewoven piece had the correct worn feel.<ref>{{cite video | title = Jack's Sash | format = [[DVD]] | publisher = [[Buena Vista (Walt Disney Company)|Buena Vista]] | year = 2006}}</ref> Sparrow wears an additional belt in the sequels, because Depp liked a new buckle which did not fit with the original piece.<ref>{{cite video | title = Jack's Belt | format = [[DVD]] | publisher = [[Buena Vista (Walt Disney Company)|Buena Vista]] | year = 2006}}</ref>

Sparrow's weapons are genuine 18th century pieces: his sword dates to the 1740s, while his pistol is from the 1760s. Both were made in London.<ref>{{cite video | title = Jack's Sword | format = [[DVD]] | publisher = [[Buena Vista (Walt Disney Company)|Buena Vista]] | year = 2006}}</ref><ref name="epic"/> Depp used two pistols on set, one being rubber. Both props survived after production of the first film.<ref>{{cite video | title = Jack's Pistol | format = [[DVD]] | publisher = [[Buena Vista (Walt Disney Company)|Buena Vista]] | year = 2006}}</ref> Sparrow's magic compass also survived into the sequels, though director [[Gore Verbinski]] had a red arrow added to the dial as it became a more prominent prop. As it does not act like a normal compass, a magnet was used to make it spin.<ref>{{cite video | title = Jack's Compass | format = [[DVD]] | publisher = [[Buena Vista (Walt Disney Company)|Buena Vista]] | year = 2006}}</ref> Sparrow wears four rings, two of which belong to Depp. Depp bought the green ring in 1989, and the gold ring is a replica of a 2400-year old ring Depp gave to the crew, though the original was later stolen. The other two are props which Depp gave backstories to: the gold-and-black ring is stolen from a Spanish widow Sparrow seduced, and the green dragon ring recalls his adventures in the Far East.<ref>{{cite video | title = Jack's Rings | format = [[DVD]] | publisher = [[Buena Vista (Walt Disney Company)|Buena Vista]] | year = 2006}}</ref> Among Depp's additional ideas was the necklace made of human toes that Sparrow wears as the [[Pelegosto]] prepare to eat him,<ref>{{cite video | title = Jack's Cannibal Toe Necklace | format = [[DVD]] | publisher = [[Buena Vista (Walt Disney Company)|Buena Vista]] | year = 2006}}</ref> and the scepter was based on one a friend of Depp's owned.<ref>{{cite video | title = Jack's Cannibal Scepter | format = [[DVD]] | publisher = [[Buena Vista (Walt Disney Company)|Buena Vista]] | year = 2006}}</ref>

During the course of the trilogy, Sparrow undergoes physical transformations. In ''The Curse of the Black Pearl'' Sparrow curses himself to battle the undead Barbossa. Like all the actors playing the ''Black Pearl'' crew, Depp had to shoot scenes in costume as a reference for the animators, and his shots as a skeleton were shot again without him. Depp reprised the scene again on a [[motion capture]] stage.<ref name="epic"/> In ''At World's End'', Sparrow hallucinates a version of himself as a member of Davy Jones<U+2019>s crew, adhered to a wall and encrusted with [[barnacles]]. Director [[Gore Verbinski]] oversaw that the design retained Sparrow's iconic look,<ref>{{cite news | author = Scott Collura, Eric Moro | title = Designing At World's End | publisher = [[IGN]] | date = [[2007-05-29]] | url = http://uk.movies.ign.com/articles/792/792383p3.html | accessdate=2007-06-02}}</ref> and rejected initial designs which portrayed him as over 100 years old.<ref>{{cite news | author = [[Drew McWeeny]] | title = AICN EXCLUSIVE!

According to screenwriters [[Ted Elliott]] and [[Terry Rossio]], Sparrow is a [[trickster]] who uses wit and deceit to attain his goals.<ref name="iconic">{{cite news | title = Pirates Dead Man's Chest: Depp's Iconic Role | publisher = Emanuel Levy | date = 2006 | url = http://www.emanuellevy.com/article.php?articleID=2688 | accessdate=2007-05-31}}</ref> He walks with a slightly [[drunk]]en swagger and has [[relaxed pronunciation|slurred]] speech and flailing hand gestures, as he is a weak swordsman.<ref name="writers curse"/> Will Turner initially believes Sparrow suffers from [[heatstroke]], but notes later that Sparrow's actions are often preplanned.<ref name="curse"/> His tactics earned an admiring comment from the character of Lieutenant Groves ([[Greg Ellis (actor)|Greg Ellis]]), who asks Cutler Beckett: "Do you think he plans it all out, or just makes it up as he goes along?"<ref name="world"/> Sparrow usually prefers the strategies of non-violent [[negotiation]]s and turning his enemies against each other as his swords skills are outclassed by other characters.<ref name="writers curse"/> He explains, "Why fight when you can negotiate? All one needs is the proper leverage."<ref name="chest"/> He will invoke parley and tempt his enemies away from their murderous intentions, encouraging them to see the bigger picture, as he does when he persuades [[Hector Barbossa]] to delay returning to mortal form so he can battle the British [[Royal Navy]].<ref name="curse"/> He often uses complex wordplay and vocabulary to confound his enemies,<ref name="curse"/><ref name="chest"/> and it is suggested that his [[pacifist|pacifism]] may be one reason Barbossa and the ''Black Pearl'' crew mutinied; Barbossa says in the first film, "That's the attitude that cost you the ''Pearl''."<ref name="curse"/>

The character is portrayed as having created, or at least contributed to, his own reputation. When Gibbs tells Will that Sparrow escaped from a desert island by strapping two sea turtles together, Sparrow embellishes the story by claiming the rope was made from hair from his own back. The video game ''[[Pirates of the Caribbean: The Legend of Jack Sparrow]]'' bases itself around these [[tall tale]]s, including the sacking of [[Nassau]] port without firing a single shot.<ref name="curse"/> In a script draft of ''Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest'' Will's guide says that he heard Sparrow escaped execution in [[Port Royal]] by grabbing two [[parrots]] and flying away.<ref name="writers chest">{{cite video | people = [[Ted Elliott]], [[Terry Rossio]] | title = Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest: Audio Commentary | format = [[DVD]] | publisher = [[Buena Vista (Walt Disney Company)|Buena Vista]] | year = 2006}}</ref> Johnny Depp has said pirates were like rock stars in that their fame preceded them, which suggests a reason for the portrayal of Sparrow as having an enormous ego.<ref name="iconic"/> Sparrow also insists on being addressed as "Captain" Jack Sparrow<ref name="curse"/> and often gives the farewell, "You will always remember this as the day you ''almost'' caught Captain Jack Sparrow," which is sometimes humorously cut off.<ref name="curse"/><ref name="chest"/> When accused by Norrington as being the worst pirate he has ever heard of, Sparrow replies that he at least has heard of him.<ref name="curse"/> In a deleted scene from ''The Curse of the Black Pearl'' Sparrow ponders being "the immortal Captain Jack Sparrow",<ref>{{cite video | title = The Immortal Captain Jack | format = [[DVD]] | publisher = [[Buena Vista (Walt Disney Company)|Buena Vista]] | year = 2003}}</ref> and during the third film he seeks immortality, although his father, Captain Teague, warns it can be a terrible curse. Sparrow also ponders being "Captain Jack Sparrow, the last pirate," as the East India Trading Company purges piracy.<ref name="world"/>

Despite his many heroics, Sparrow is a pirate and a morally ambiguous character.<ref name="success">{{cite web | title = Success Can Be a Tough Taskmaster | publisher = ''Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End'' Production Notes | url = http://numberonestars.com/pirates3/production1.htm | accessdate=2007-05-31}}</ref> When agreeing to trade 100 souls, including Will, to [[Davy Jones (Pirates of the Caribbean)|Davy Jones]] in exchange for his freedom, Jones asks Sparrow whether he can, "condemn an innocent man<U+2014>a friend<U+2014>to a lifetime of servitude in your name while you roam free?" Sparrow merely replies, "Yep! I'm good with it!"<ref name="chest"/> He carelessly runs up debts with [[Anamaria]],<ref name="curse"/> Davy Jones, and the other pirate lords.<ref name="world"/> [[Sao Feng]] ([[Chow Yun-Fat]]), pirate lord of [[Singapore]], is particularly hateful towards him.<ref name="world"/> In a cowardly moment, Sparrow abandons his crew during the [[Kraken (Pirates of the Caribbean)|Kraken]]'s attack, but underlying loyalty and morality compel him to return and save them.<ref>''Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest'' comic book adaptation, [[Disney Adventures]], 2006</ref> Sparrow claims to be a man of his word,<ref name="curse"/> and expresses surprise that people doubt his truthfulness.<ref name="chest"/> His morality is revealed in his official backstory in which he refused to transport slaves,<ref name="wench"/> nor is there [[murder]] or [[rape]] on his criminal record.<ref name="curse"/><ref name="crimes"/> 

Depp partly based the character on [[Pep<U+00E9> Le Pew]], a [[womaniser|womanizing]] [[skunk]] from ''[[Looney Tunes]]''.<ref name="depp gold"/> Sparrow claims to have a "tremendous intuitive sense of the female creature",<ref name="chest"/> although his conquests are often left with a sour memory of him. Former flames, Scarlett and Giselle, usually slap him<ref name="curse"/> or anyone looking for him.<ref name="chest"/> His witty charm easily attracts women, and even has [[Elizabeth Swann]] questioning her feelings.<ref name="chest"/> Director [[Gore Verbinski]] noted phallic connotations in Sparrow's relationship with his vessel, as he grips the [[steering wheel (ship)|steering wheel]].<ref name="depp commentary"/> The ''[[Black Pearl]]'' is described as "the only ship which can outrun the ''[[The Flying Dutchman (Pirates of the Caribbean)|Flying Dutchman]]''".<ref name="world"/> The [[Freudian]] overtones continue in the third film when Sparrow and Barbossa battle for captaincy of the ''Black Pearl'', showing off the length of their [[telescopes]], and in a deleted scene, they fight over the steering wheel.<ref>{{cite video | people = [[Gore Verbinski]] | title = Two Captains, One Ship audio commentary | format = DVD | publisher = [[Buena Vista]] | year = 2007}}</ref> Sparrow claims his "first and only love is the sea,",<ref name="chest"/> and describes his ship as representing freedom.<ref name="curse"/> [[Davy Jones<U+2019>s Locker (Pirates of the Caribbean)|Davy Jones<U+2019>s Locker]] is represented as a desert, symbolising his personal [[hell]].<ref name="writers chest"/> 

Sparrow also has bad personal hygiene, a trait of Pep<U+00E9> Le Pew. Verbinski described Sparrow's breath as "like a donkey's ass".<ref name="depp commentary"/> Sparrow knocks Will off his ship simply by huffing at him.<ref name="world"/> Lastly, Sparrow has an insatiable thirst for [[rum]], which can confuse his magic compass as to what he wants most.<ref name="chest"/><ref name="world"/> According to his criminal record on the ''At World's End'' website, he even sacked a shipment of rum to quench his thirst.<ref name="crimes">{{cite web | title = "Port Royal" | publisher = Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End Official Website | url = http://disney.go.com/disneypictures/pirates/atworldsend/ | accessdate=2007-05-31}}</ref>

==Popular culture==
When ''[[Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest]]'' grossed over $1 billion worldwide, Ian Nathan attributed this to Sparrow's popularity: "''Pirates'', the franchise, only had to turn up. There was a powerful holdover from the cheeky delights of its debut, something we hadn't felt since the [[Clone Wars (Star Wars)|Clone Wars]] called it a day."<ref>{{cite news | author = Ian Nathan | pages = 176 | publisher = [[Empire (magazine)|Empire]] | title = How Pirates' feckless hero won over the fans before he even showed up | date = [[2006-10-27]] | accessdate=2007-05-31}}</ref> ''[[Empire (magazine)|Empire]]'' declared [[Johnny Depp]]'s performance to be the seventy-fourth "thing that rocked our world" in 2006 when celebrating 200 issues.<ref>{{cite news | title = 200 things that rocked our world | pages = 118 | publisher = [[Empire (magazine)|Empire]] | date = [[2006-01-02]] | accessdate = 2007-05-31}}</ref> A survey of more than 3,000 people showed Jack Sparrow was the most popular [[Halloween]] costume of 2006,<ref>{{cite news | title = Captain Jack Sparrow top pick for 2006 Most Popular Halloween Costume | publisher = Extreme Halloween Network | date = [[2006-10-17]] | url = http://www.anniescostumes.com/popularhalloweencostumes2006.htm | accessdate=2007-06-02}}</ref> and a 2007 poll held by the [[Internet Movie Database]] showed Sparrow to be the second most popular [[live action]] hero, after [[Indiana Jones]].<ref>{{cite web | title = From this list of live-action heroes, who is your favorite? | publisher = [[Internet Movie Database]] | date = [[2007-06-03]] | url = http://www.imdb.com/poll/results/2007-06-03 | accessdate=2007-06-03}}</ref> In a 2007 [[Pearl & Dean]] poll, Jack Sparrow is Depp's most popular performance.<ref>{{cite news | url = http://people.monstersandcritics.com/news/article_1307679.php | title = Johnny Depp's great Captain role | publisher = [[People (magazine)|People]] | date = [[2007-05-22]] | accessdate=2007-06-04}}</ref>

Emanuel Levy feels the character is the only iconic film character of the 2000s,<ref name="iconic"/> while Todd Gilchrist feels Sparrow is the only element of the films that will remain timeless.<ref>{{cite news | author = Todd Gilchrist | url = http://uk.movies.ign.com/articles/791/791309p1.html | title = Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End  | publisher = [[IGN]] | date = [[2007-05-24]] | accessdate=2007-05-24}}</ref> According to Sharon Eberson, the character's popularity can be attributed to being a "scoundrel whose occasional bouts of conscience allow viewers to go with the flaws because, as played to the larger-than-life hilt by Depp, he owns every scene he is in."<ref>{{cite news | author = Sharon Eberson | title = Jack Sparrow joins a unique line of iconic characters | publisher = Post Gazette | date = [[2007-05-24]] | url = http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/07144/788381-254.stm | accessdate=2007-06-02}}</ref> Film history professor at [[UCLA]] Jonathan Kuntz also attributed his popularity to the increased questioning of [[masculinity]] in the 21st century, and Sparrow's personality contrasts with action-adventure heroes in cinema. [[Leonard Maltin]] concurs that Sparrow has a carefree attitude and does not take himself seriously.<ref>{{cite news | author = Sandy Cohen | title = Depp<U+2019>s Sparrow smashes cinematic pirate mold | publisher = Pantagraph | date = [[2007-05-24]] | url = http://www.pantagraph.com/articles/2007/05/24/freetime/doc4654bef24a573940671942.txt | accessdate = 2007-06-02}}</ref> Mark Fox also noted Sparrow is an escapist fantasy figure for women, free from much of the responsibility of most heroes.<ref>{{cite news | author = Mark Fox | title = Besting Jack Sparrow | publisher = Crave Online | date = [[2007-05-24]] | url = http://www.craveonline.com/humor/articles/04647967/besting_jack_sparrow.html | accessdate=2007-06-04}}</ref> Sparrow is listed by ''[[IGN]]'' as one of their ten favorite film outlaws, as he "lives for himself and the freedom to do whatever it is that he damn well pleases. Precious few film characters have epitomized what makes the outlaw such a romantic figure for audiences as Captain Jack Sparrow has."<ref>{{cite news | title = Top Ten Movie Outlaws | publisher = [[IGN]] | date = [[2007-09-19]] | url = http://movies.ign.com/articles/821/821191p1.html | accessdate=2007-09-22}}</ref>

In addition to his role in the ''Pirates of the Caribbean'' series, Sparrow was parodied as "Jack [[Swallow]]s" in ''[[Epic Movie]]'' ([[2007 in film|2007]]), where he was played by [[Darrell Hammond]].<ref>{{cite video | people = [[Jason Friedberg]], [[Aaron Seltzer]] (directors) | title = [[Epic Movie]] | format = [[Film]] | publisher = [[Regency Enterprises]] | year = 2007}}</ref> Sparrow also cameos in the [[DC Comics]] series ''[[52 (comic book)|52]]'' with a group of time-displaced pirates and robots.<ref>{{Comic book reference | Writer = [[Geoff Johns]], [[Grant Morrison]], [[Greg Rucka]], [[Mark Waid]] | Title = [[52 (comic book)|52]] | Issue = 24 | Date = [[2006-10-18]] | Publisher = [[DC Comics]]}}</ref>
