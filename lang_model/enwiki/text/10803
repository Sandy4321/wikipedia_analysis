'''Barbara McClintock''' ([[June 16]] [[1902]] <U+2013> [[September 2]] [[1992]]) was a pioneering  [[United States|American]] scientist and one of the world's most distinguished [[cytogenetics|cytogeneticists]]. McClintock received her [[Doctor of Philosophy|PhD]] in [[botany]] from [[Cornell University]] in 1927, where she was a leader in the development of [[maize]] cytogenetics. The field remained the focus of her research for the rest of her career. From the late [[1920s#Science|1920s]], McClintock studied [[chromosome]]s and how they change during reproduction in maize. Her work was groundbreaking: she developed the technique to visualize maize chromosomes and used microscopic analysis to demonstrate many fundamental genetic ideas, including [[genetic recombination]] by [[chromosomal crossover|crossing-over]] during [[meiosis]]<U+2014>a mechanism by which chromosomes exchange information. She produced the first [[genetic map]] for maize, linking regions of the chromosome with physical traits, and she demonstrated the role of the [[telomere]] and [[centromere]], regions of the chromosome that are important in the conservation of genetic information. She was recognized amongst the best in the field, awarded prestigious fellowships and elected a member of the [[National Academy of Sciences]] in 1944. 

During the [[1940s#Science|1940s]] and [[1950s#Science|1950s]], McClintock discovered [[transposition (genetics)|transposition]] and used it to show how [[gene]]s are responsible for turning physical characteristics on or off. She developed theories to explain the repression or expression of genetic information from one generation of maize plants to the next. Encountering skepticism of her research and its implications, she stopped publishing her data in 1953. Later, she made an extensive study of the cytogenetics and [[ethnobotany]] of maize [[race (biology)|race]]s from South America. McClintock's research became well understood in the 1960s and 1970s, as researchers demonstrated the mechanisms of genetic change and [[gene regulation|genetic regulation]] that she had demonstrated in her maize research in the 1940s and 1950s. Awards and recognition of her contributions to the field followed, including the [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]] awarded to her in 1983 for the discovery of genetic [[Transposition (genetics)|transposition]]; to date, she has been the first and only woman to receive an unshared Nobel Prize in that category.

==Early life==
Barbara McClintock was born in [[Hartford, Connecticut]], the third of four children of physician Thomas Henry McClintock and Sara Handy McClintock. She was independent from a very young age, a trait McClintock described as her "capacity to be alone." From about the age of three until the time she started school, McClintock lived with an aunt and uncle in Massachusetts in order to reduce the financial burden on her parents while her father established his medical practice. The McClintocks moved to semi-rural [[Brooklyn, New York]] in 1908. She was described as a solitary and independent child, and a tomboy. She was close to her father, but had a difficult relationship with her mother.<ref name = "Keller">Keller, Evelyn Fox (1983) ''A feeling for the organism''.  W. H. Freeman and Company, New York ISBN 0-7167-1433-7</ref> 

McClintock completed her secondary education at [[Erasmus Hall High School]] in Brooklyn. She discovered science at high school, and wanted to attend [[Cornell University]] to continue her studies. Her mother resisted the idea of higher education for her daughters on the theory that it would make them unmarriageable, and the family also had financial problems. Barbara was almost prevented from starting college, but her father intervened, and she entered Cornell in 1919.

==Education and research at Cornell==
McClintock began her studies at Cornell's College of Agriculture in 1919. She studied [[botany]], receiving a BSc in 1923. Her interest in genetics had been sparked when she took her first course in that field in 1921. The course was the only one of its type offered to undergraduates in the United States at the time, and was taught by [[C. B. Hutchison]], a plant breeder and geneticist. Hutchinson was impressed by McClintock's interest, and telephoned to invite her to participate in the graduate genetics course at Cornell in 1922. McClintock pointed to Hutchinson's invitation as the reason she continued in genetics: "Obviously, this telephone call cast the die for my future. I remained with genetics thereafter." <ref>McClintock, Barbara. ''A short biographical note: Barbara McClintock'' (1983) [http://www.nobel.se/medicine/laureates/1983/mcclintock-autobio.html Nobel Foundation] [http://profiles.nlm.nih.gov/LL/B/B/H/C/_/llbbhc.pdf .pdf]<br></ref>

Women could not major in genetics at Cornell, and therefore her MA and PhD <U+2014> earned in 1925 and 1927, respectively <U+2014> were officially awarded in botany. During her graduate studies and her postgraduate appointment as a botany instructor, McClintock was instrumental in assembling a group that studied the new field of [[cytogenetics]] in [[maize]]. This group brought together plant breeders and cytologists, and included [[Rollins Emerson]], [[Charles R. Burnham]], [[Marcus Rhoades]], and [[George Beadle]] (who became a Nobel laureate in 1958 for showing that genes control metabolism). McClintock's cytogenetic research focused on developing ways to visualize and characterize maize chromosomes. This particular part of her work influenced a generation of students, as it was included in most textbooks. She also developed a technique using [[carmine]] staining to visualize maize chromosomes, and showed for the first time that maize had 10 chromosomes. By studying the banding patterns of the chromosomes, McClintock was able to [[genetic linkage|link]] to a specific chromosome groups of traits that were inherited together. Marcus Rhoades noted that McClintock's 1929 ''[[Genetics (journal)|Genetics]]'' paper on the characterization of [[polyploidy|triploid]] maize chromosomes triggered scientific interest in maize cytogenetics, and attributed to his female colleague 10 of the 17 significant advances in the field that were made by Cornell scientists between 1929 and 1935.<ref>Rhoades, Marcus M. ''The golden age of corn genetics at Cornell as seen though the eyes of M. M. Rhoades'' undated [http://profiles.nlm.nih.gov/LL/B/B/F/Z/_/llbbfz.pdf .pdf] <br></ref>

In 1930, McClintock was the first person to describe the cross-shaped interaction of homologous chromosomes during meiosis. During 1931, McClintock and a graduate student, [[Harriet Creighton]], proved the link between [[chromosomal crossover]] during [[meiosis]] and the recombination of genetic traits. They observed how the recombination of chromosomes and the resulting phenotype formed the inheritance of a new trait.<ref>Creighton, Harriet B., and McClintock, Barbara (1931) A Correlation of Cytological and Genetical Crossing-Over in Zea Mays. Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences 17:492<U+2013>497</ref> Until this point, it had only been hypothesized that [[genetic recombination]] could occur during meiosis. McClintock published the first genetic map for maize in 1931, showing the order of three genes on maize chromosome 9.<ref>McClintock, Barbara (1931) The order of the genes C, Sh, and Wx in Zea Mays with reference to a cytologically known point in the chromosome. Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences 17:485<U+2013>91</ref> In 1932, she produced a cytogenetic analysis of the [[centromere]], describing the organization and function of the centromere.

McClintock's breakthrough publications, and support from her colleagues, led to her being awarded several postdoctoral fellowships from the [[United States National Research Council|National Research Council]]. This funding allowed her to continue to study genetics at Cornell, the [[University of Missouri - Columbia]], and the [[California Institute of Technology]], where she worked with [[Thomas Hunt Morgan]]. During the summers of 1931 and 1932, she worked with geneticist [[Lewis Stadler]] at Missouri, who introduced her to the use of [[X-ray]]s as a [[mutagen]].  (Exposure to X-rays can increase the rate of mutation above the natural background level, making it a powerful research tool for genetics.) Through her work with X-ray-mutagenized maize, she identified [[ring chromosome]]s, which form when the ends of a single chromosome fuse together after radiation damage. From this evidence, McClintock hypothesized that there must be a structure on the chromosome tip that would normally ensure stability, which she called the [[telomere]]. She showed that the loss of ring-chromosomes at meiosis caused [[variegation]] in maize foliage in generations subsequent to irradiation resulting from chromosomal deletion. During this period, she demonstrated the presence of what she called the [[nucleolar organizer]]s on a region on maize chromosome 6, which is required for the assembly of the [[nucleolus]] during DNA replication.

McClintock received a fellowship from the [[Guggenheim Foundation]] that made possible six months of training in Germany during 1933 and 1934. She had planned to work with [[Curt Stern]], who had demonstrated crossover in [[Drosophila]] just weeks after McClintock and Creighton had done so; however, in the meantime, Stern emigrated to the United States. Instead,  she worked in Germany with geneticist [[Richard B. Goldschmidt]]. She left Germany early, amid mounting political tension in Europe, and returned to Cornell, remaining there until 1936, when she accepted an Assistant Professorship offered to her by Lewis Stadler in the Department of Botany at the University of Missouri - Columbia.

==University of Missouri - Columbia==
During her time at Missouri, McClintock expanded her research on the effect of X-rays on maize cytogenetics. McClintock observed the breakage and fusion of chromosomes in irradiated maize cells. She was also able to show that, in some plants, spontaneous chromosome breakage occurred in the cells of the endosperm. Over the course of [[mitosis]], she observed that the ends of broken chromatids were rejoined after the chromosome [[DNA replication|replication]]. In the [[anaphase]] of mitosis, the broken chromosomes formed a chromatid bridge, which was broken when the chromatids moved towards the cell poles. The broken ends were rejoined in the [[interphase]] of the next mitosis, and the cycle was repeated, causing massive mutation, which she could detect as variegation in the endosperm.<ref>McClintock, Barbara (1941) The stability of broken ends of chromosomes in Zea Mays, Genetics 26:234<U+2013>82</ref> This cycle of breakage, fusion, and bridge, also described as the breakage<U+2013>rejoining<U+2013>bridge cycle, was a key cytogenetic discovery for several reasons. First it showed that the rejoining of chromosomes was not a random event, and secondly it demonstrated a source of large-scale mutation. For this reason, it remains an area of interest in [[cancer]] research today.

Although her research was progressing at Missouri, McClintock was not satisfied with her position at the University. She was excluded from faculty meetings, and was not made aware of positions available at other institutions.<ref name = "Keller"/> In 1940 she wrote to Charles Burnham, "I have decided that I must look for another job. As far as I can make out, there is nothing more for me here. I am an assistant professor at $3,000 and I feel sure that that is the limit for me." <ref>McClintock, Barbara. Letter from Barbara McClintock to Charles R. Burnham (16 September 1940) [http://profiles.nlm.nih.gov/LL/B/B/N/T/_/llbbnt.pdf .pdf]<br></ref> She was also aware that her position had been especially created for her by Stadler and may have depended on his presence. McClintock believed she would not gain [[tenure]] at Missouri, although according to some accounts she knew she would be offered a promotion by Missouri in the Spring of 1942.<ref>Comfort, Nathaniel C. (2002) Barbara McClintock's long postdoc years. ''Science''  295:440</ref> In the summer of 1941 she took a leave of absence from Missouri to visit [[Columbia University]], where her Cornell colleague Marcus Rhoades was a professor. He offered to share his research field at Cold Spring Harbor on Long Island. In December 1941 she was offered a research position by [[Milislav Demerec]], and she joined the staff of the [[Carnegie Institution of Washington]]'s Department of Genetics [[Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory]].

==Cold Spring Harbor==
After her year-long appointment, McClintock accepted a full-time research position at [[Cold Spring Harbor]]. Here, she was highly productive and continued her work with the breakage-fusion-bridge cycle, using it to substitute for X-rays as a tool for mapping new genes. In 1944, in recognition of her prominence in the field of genetics during this period, McClintock was elected to the [[National Academy of Sciences]] <U+2014> only the third woman to be so elected. In 1945, she became the first woman president of the [[Genetics Society of America]]. In 1944 she undertook a cytogenetic analysis of ''[[Neurospora crassa]]'' at the suggestion of George Beadle, who had used the fungus to demonstrate the one gene<U+2013>one enzyme relationship. He invited her to [[Stanford University|Stanford]] to undertake the study. She successfully described the number of chromosomes, or [[karyotype]], of ''N. crassa'' and described the entire life cycle of the species. ''N. crassa'' has since become a [[model organism|model species]] for classical genetic analysis.<ref>McClintock, Barbara (1945) Neurospora: preliminary observations of the chromosomes of Neurospora crassa.

===Discovery of controlling elements===
[[Image:Corn mosaic.jpg|right|thumb|240px|The relationship of ''Ac/Ds'' in the control of the elements and mosaic color of maize. The seed in 10 is colorless, there is no ''Ac'' element present and ''Ds'' inhibits the synthesis of colored pigments called [[anthocyanin]]s. In 11 to 13, one copy of ''Ac'' is present. ''Ds'' can move and some anthocyanin is produced, creating a mosaic pattern. In the kernel in panel 14 there are two ''Ac'' elements and in 15 there are three.<!-- FAIR USE of Image:Corn mosaic.jpg: see image description page at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Corn mosaic.jpg for rationale -->]]
In the summer of 1944 at Cold Spring Harbor, McClintock began systematic studies on the mechanisms of the [[Mosaic (genetics)|mosaic]] color patterns of maize seed and the unstable [[Biological inheritance|inheritance]] of this mosaicism. She identified two new [[Dominance relationship|dominant]] and interacting genetic loci that she named ''Dissociator'' (''Ds'') and ''Activator'' (''Ac''). She found that the ''Dissociator'' did not just dissociate or cause the chromosome to break, it also had a variety of effects on neighboring genes when the ''Activator'' was also present. In early 1948, she made the surprising discovery that both ''Dissociator'' and ''Activator'' could transpose, or change position, on the chromosome. 

She observed the effects of the transposition of ''Ac'' and ''Ds'' by the changing patterns of coloration in maize kernels over generations of controlled crosses, and described the relationship between the two [[Locus (genetics)|loci]] through intricate microscopic analysis. She concluded that ''Ac'' controls the transposition of the ''Ds'' from chromosome 9, and that the movement of ''Ds'' is accompanied by the breakage of the chromosome. When ''Ds'' moves, the [[aleurone]]-color gene is released from the suppressing effect of the ''Ds'' and transformed into the active form, which initiates the pigment synthesis in cells. The transposition of ''Ds'' in different cells is random, it may move in some but not others, which causes color mosaicism. The size of the colored spot on the seed is determined by stage of the seed development during dissociation. McClintock also found that the transposition of ''Ds'' and the is determined by the number of ''Ac'' copies in the cell.

Between 1948 and 1950, she developed a theory by which these mobile elements regulated the genes by inhibiting or modulating their action. She referred to ''Dissociator'' and ''Activator'' as "controlling units"<U+2014>later, as "controlling elements"<U+2014>to distinguish them from genes. She hypothesized that [[gene regulation]] could explain how complex multicellular organisms made of cells with identical [[genome]]s have cells of different function. McClintock's discovery challenged the concept of the genome as a static set of instructions passed between generations. In 1950, she reported her work on ''Ac/Ds'' and her ideas about gene regulation in a paper entitled "The origin and behavior of mutable loci in maize" published in the journal ''[[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences]]''. In summer 1951, she reported on her work on gene mutability in maize at the annual symposium at Cold Spring Harbor, the paper she presented was called "Chromosome organization and genic expression".<ref>McClintock, Barbara (1950) The origin and behavior of mutable loci in maize. Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. 36:344<U+2013>55</ref> 

Her work on controlling elements and gene regulation was conceptually difficult and was not immediately understood or accepted by her contemporaries; she described the reception of her research as "puzzlement, even hostility".<ref>McClintock, Barbara. "Introduction" in ''The discovery and characterization of transposable elements: the collected papers of Barbara McClintock''</ref> Nevertheless, McClintock continued to develop her ideas on controlling elements. She published a paper in ''[[Genetics (journal)|Genetics]]'' in 1953 where she presented all her statistical data and undertook lecture tours to universities throughout the 1950s to speak about her work.<ref>McClintock, Barbara (1953) Induction of instability at selected loci in maize. Genetics 38:579<U+2013>99</ref> She continued to investigate the problem and identified a new element that she called ''Suppressor-mutator'' (''Spm''), which, although similar to ''Ac/Ds'' displays more complex behavior. Based on the reactions of other scientists to her work, McClintock felt she risked alienating the scientific mainstream, and from 1953 stopped publishing accounts of her research on controlling elements.<ref name = "Comfort">Comfort, Nathaniel, C.(1999) "The real point is control": The reception of Barbara McClintock's controlling elements.

===The origins of maize===
[[Image:Corn and microscope.jpg|right|thumb|220px|McClintock's microscope and ears of corn on exhibition at the [[National Museum of Natural History]].]]
In 1957, McClintock received funding from the [[National Science Foundation]], and the [[Rockefeller Foundation]] sponsored her to start research on maize in [[South America]], an area that is rich in varieties of this species<!--Check my hunch here-->. She was interested in studying the  [[evolution]] of maize, and being in South America would allow her to work on a larger scale. McClintock explored the chromosomal, morphological, and evolutionary characteristics of various [[Race (biology)|races]] of maize. From 1962, she supervised four scientists working on South American maize at the North Carolina State University in Raleigh. Two of these Rockefeller fellows, [[Almeiro Blumenschein]] and [[T. Angel Kato]], continued their research on South American races of maize well into the 1970s. In 1981, Blumenschein, Kato, and McClintock published ''Chromosome constitution of races of maize'', which is considered a landmark study of maize that has contributed significantly to the fields of evolutionary botany, [[ethnobotany]], and [[paleobotany]].

===Rediscovery of McClintock's controlling elements===
McClintock officially retired from her position at the Carnegie Institution in 1967, and was awarded the Cold Spring Harbor Distinguished Service Award; however, she continued to work with graduate students and colleagues in the Cold Spring Laboratory as ''scientist emerita''. In reference to her decision 20 years earlier no longer to publish detailed accounts of her work on controlling elements, she wrote in 1973: <blockquote>Over the years I have found that it is difficult if not impossible to bring to consciousness of another person the nature of his tacit assumptions when, by some special experiences, I have been made aware of them. This became painfully evident to me in my attempts during the 1950s to convince geneticists that the action of genes had to be and was controlled. It is now equally painful to recognize the fixity of assumptions that many persons hold on the nature of controlling elements in maize and the manners of their operation. One must await the right time for conceptual change.<ref>McClintock, Barbara. Letter from Barbara McClintock to J. R. S. Fincham (1973) [http://profiles.nlm.nih.gov/LL/B/B/G/C/_/llbbgc.pdf .pdf]</ref></blockquote>

The importance of McClintock's contributions only came to light in the 1960s, when the work of French geneticists [[Francois Jacob]] and [[Jacques Monod]] described the genetic regulation of the [[Lac operon|''lac'' operon]], a concept she had demonstrated with ''Ac/Ds'' in 1951. Following Jacob and Monod's paper 1961 ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' paper "Genetic regulatory mechanisms in the synthesis of proteins", McClintock wrote an article for ''[[American Naturalist]]'' comparing the ''lac'' operon and her work on controlling elements in maize.<ref>McClintock, Barbara (1961) Some parallels between gene control systems in maize and in bacteria. American Naturalist 95:265<U+2013>77</ref> McClintock's contribution to biology is still not widely acknowledged as amounting to the discovery of genetic regulation.<ref name = "Comfort"/>

McClintock was widely credited for discovering transposition following the discovery of the process in bacteria and yeast in the late 1960s and early 1970s. During this period, molecular biology had developed significant new technology, and scientists were able to show the molecular basis for transposition. In the 1970s, other scientists ''Ac'' and ''Ds'' were [[cloning|cloned]] and were shown to be [[transposon|Class II transposons]]. ''Ac'' is a complete transposon that can produce a functional [[transposase]], which is required for the element to move within the genome. ''Ds'' has a mutation in its transposase gene, which means that it cannot move without another source of transposase. Thus, as McClintock observed, ''Ds'' cannot move in the absence of ''Ac''. ''Spm'' has also been characterized as a transposon. Subsequent research has shown that transposons typically do not move unless the cell is placed under stress, such as by irradiation or the breakage, fusion, and bridge cycle, and thus their activation during stress can serve as a source of genetic variation for evolution. McClintock understood the role of transposons in evolution and genome change well before other researchers grasped the concept. Nowadays, ''Ac/Ds'' is used as a tool in plant biology to generate mutant plants used for the characterization of gene function.

===Honors and recognition===
McClintock was awarded the [[National Medal of Science]] by [[Richard Nixon]] in 1971. Cold Spring Harbor named a building in her honor in 1973. In 1981 she became the first recipient of the [[MacArthur Foundation|MacArthur Foundation Grant]], and was awarded the [[Albert Lasker Award for Basic Medical Research]], the [[Wolf Prize in Medicine]] and the Thomas Hunt Morgan Medal by the Genetics Society of America. In 1982 she was awarded the [[Louisa Gross Horwitz Prize]] for her research in the "evolution of genetic information and the control of its expression." Most notably, she received the [[Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine]] in 1983, credited by the [[Nobel Foundation]] for discovering "mobile genetic elements", over thirty years after she initially described the phenomenon of controlling elements.

She was awarded 14 Honorary Doctor of Science degrees and an Honorary Doctor of Humane Letters. In 1986 she was inducted into the [[National Women's Hall of Fame]]. During her final years, McClintock led a more public life, especially after [[Evelyn Fox Keller|Evelyn Fox Keller's]] 1983 book ''A feeling for the organism'' brought McClintock's story to the public. She remained a regular presence in the Cold Spring Harbor community, and gave talks on mobile genetic elements and the history of genetics research for the benefit of junior scientists. An anthology of her 43 publications ''The discovery and characterization of transposable elements: the collected papers of Barbara McClintock'' was published in 1987. McClintock died near Cold Spring Harbor in Huntington, New York, on [[September 2]], [[1992]] at the age of 90; she never married or had children.

==Legacy==
Since her death, McClintock has been the subject of the biographical work by science historian [[Nathaniel C. Comfort]], in ''The tangled field : Barbara McClintock's search for the patterns of genetic control''. Comfort's biography contests some claims about McClintock, described as the "McClintock Myth", which he claims was perpetuated by the earlier biography by Keller. Keller's thesis was that McClintock was long ignored because she was a woman working in the sciences, whereas Comfort asserts that McClintock was well regarded by her professional peers, even in the early years of her career.<ref>Comfort, Nathaniel C. (2001) The tangled field: Barbara McClintock's search for the patterns of genetic control Harvard University Press, Cambridge, MA. ISBN 0-674-00456-6</ref> Although Comfort argues that McClintock was not a victim of sex discrimination, she has been widely written about in the context of women's studies, and most recent biographical works on women in science feature accounts of her experience. She is held up as a role model for girls in such works of children's literature as Edith Hope Fine's ''Barbara McClintock, Nobel Prize geneticist'', Deborah Heiligman's ''Barbara McClintock: alone in her field'' and Mary Kittredge's ''Barbara McClintock''.

On [[May 4]], [[2005]] the [[United States Postal Service]] issued the ''American Scientists'' commemorative [[postage stamp]] series, a set of four 37-cent self-adhesive stamps in several configurations.  The scientists depicted were Barbara McClintock, [[John von Neumann]], [[Josiah Willard Gibbs]], and [[Richard Feynman]]. McClintock was also featured in a 1989 four-stamp issue from [[Sweden]] which illustrated the work of eight Nobel Prize-winning geneticists. A small building at Cornell University bears her name to this day.
