== Role of fluoride ==
Fluoride has proven to be an essential element with preventative and protective properties. Fluoride is capable of combating and working against tooth decay and increases resistance to the "demineralisation of tooth enamel during attack by acidic bacterias". <ref>{{Cite web|title = .|url = Gluckman, P., & Skegg, D. (2014). Health effects of water fluoridation: A review of the scientific evidence. Royal Society of New Zealand. Retrieved 15 April 2015, from http://www.royalsociety.org.nz/media/2014/08/Health-effects-of-water-fluoridation_Aug_2014_corrected_Jan_2015.pdf}}</ref> While essential for all individuals, it is significant for children, as when ingested, the fluoride is incorporated into their developing enamel. This in turn causes their teeth to become less prone to decay. Therefore a relationship can be formulated, in that the more fluoride entering the body, the overall decline in the rate of decay.<ref>{{Cite web|url = Gluckman, P., & Skegg, D. (2014).

== Sources of fluoride ==
Fluorine is one of the most common and rich elements to exist within the Earth's crust. Despite being an element, it is most commonly found in its ion form, or additionally as inorganic or organic fluorides.<ref>{{Cite web|url = Members of Optusnet,. (1999). Sources of Fluoride. Retrieved 15 April 2015, from http://www.members.optusnet.com.au/rivermouth/fluoridereview.pdf|title = .}}</ref> There are a number of sources of fluoride, these include:

=== Water ===
In Australia fluoride occurs naturally within water supplies, at a concentration of approximately 0.1mg/L. However, this number varies amongst different populations, as specific fluoridated communities exceed this amount, ranging from 0.6-1.0mg/L of fluoride present.<ref>{{Cite web|title = .|url = Members of Optusnet,. (1999). Sources of Fluoride. Retrieved 15 April 2015, from http://www.members.optusnet.com.au/rivermouth/fluoridereview.pdf}}</ref> Studies have proven that fluoridated water has reduced total tooth decay by up to 60%.

The process of incorporating more fluoride into water systems is an affordable mechanism that can provide many beneficial effects in the long term.

=== Dentrifices ===
Fluoride toothpaste came into production in the 1890s, after it's benefits were investigated. This product has become available to most industrialised countries, and within Australia accounts for "90% of total toothpaste purchased".<ref>{{Cite web|url = Members of Optusnet,. (1999). Sources of Fluoride. Retrieved 15 April 2015, from http://www.members.optusnet.com.au/rivermouth/fluoridereview.pdf|title = .}}</ref>

=== Fluoride supplements ===
Fluoride supplements were first recognised and highly suggested by health professionals, in areas where the practice of fluoridating water was not accepted. Such mechanisms are recommended for individuals, primarily children (whom of which are at a greater risk of caries) in low-fluoride ares. Supplements can be in various forms including tablets, drops or lozenges, and have proven to greatly decrease the case and rate of tooth decay.<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.members.optusnet.com.au/rivermouth/fluoridereview.pdf|title = Sources of Fluoride|date = 1999|accessdate = 15 April 2015|website = Members of Optusnet|publisher = NHMRC}}</ref>
