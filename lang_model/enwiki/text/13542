"'''A Hero Sits Next Door'''" is the fifth episode of [[Family Guy (season 1)|season one]] of ''[[Family Guy]]'', originally aired on [[Fox Network|Fox]] on May 2, 1999. The episode features the introduction of [[Joe Swanson]], who would become a recurring character in the series. [[Peter Griffin]] must find a replacement player for an upcoming softball game. Peter eventually convinces Joe to play for the team after learning that he played baseball in college. When Joe shows up the following morning, Peter realizes that Joe is in a [[wheelchair]]. Joe turns out to be a great player, and the team wins the game. Peter becomes jealous of Joe and tries to become a hero. In a subplot, [[Meg Griffin]] tries to get Joe's son Kevin to notice her.

"A Hero Sits Next Door" was directed by Monte Young and written by the writing team of [[Mike Barker (producer)|Mike Barker]] and [[Matt Weitzman]]. It featured guest performances from actresses [[Suzie Plakson]] and [[Michelle Kwan]], as well as actors [[Wally Wingert]] and [[Carlos Alazraqui]]. Much of the episode features a [[cutaway]] style of humor that is typically used in ''Family Guy'', many of which feature cultural references and include ''[[Super Friends]]'', [[Pez]], and the assassinations of [[John F. Kennedy]] and [[Robert F. Kennedy]]. Unlike the previous four episodes of ''Family Guy'', "A Hero Sits Next Door" does not feature words in its title pertaining to "Death" or "Murder"; this convention was originally started due to creator Seth MacFarlane being a fan of 1930s and 1940s radio programs, particularly the radio thriller anthology ''[[Suspense (radio program)|Suspense]]''; however, this convention was dropped after individual episodes became difficult for the series' writing staff to identify and distinguish.

"A Hero Sits Next Door" received positive praise from television critics, who considered it to be a memorable introduction for the character of Joe Swanson; certain critics praised the fight sequence between Joe and [[The Grinch]], while others criticized the episode's cutaway gags as well as its plot twists, which they regarded as "odd" and "counter-intuitive".

==Plot summary==
At the ''Happy-Go-Lucky Toy Factory'', safety inspector [[Peter Griffin]] is working when his boss [[Jonathan Weed|Mr. Weed]] introduces Guillermo, a [[List of sports idioms#R|ringer]] who will attempt to assist the company in winning the annual softball game. At home, Peter's wife [[Lois Griffin|Lois]] informs him of their new neighbors, the Swanson family, and wishes for him to make friends with them; however, Peter is not interested and leaves with Brian for softball practice. The regular pitcher is absent, so Peter fills in. He injures Guillermo with a wild pitch during practice and must find a new player to replace him or be fired.

Meanwhile, Lois goes with her son [[Stewie Griffin|Stewie]] to meet the new neighbors. She is greeted by Bonnie Swanson and soon after meets her husband [[Joe Swanson|Joe]]. When Peter comes home he is rude to the Swansons. Later that night, Peter thinks about who can replace Guillermo, and Lois mentions that Joe played [[baseball]] in college. Peter sees Joe in his truck, which prevents him from seeing he is in a wheelchair, and invites him to join the team. The next morning Peter and Mr. Weed are at the field. Joe shows up for the game and Peter and Mr. Weed are horrified to see that he is in a [[wheelchair]]. However, Joe turns out to be a fantastic player and leads the team to victory. That night Joe has a celebratory party in his house, where he reveals that he is a [[police officer]] who was crippled after fighting [[The Grinch]] on the roof of an [[orphanage]], and soon becomes very popular with the neighbors, including Peter's family.

Joe's popularity makes Peter jealous, so Peter wants to be a hero too. He attempts to stop a bank robbery to compete with Joe's heroism. Peter and Brian are taken hostage in the process, but Joe convinces the robbers to surrender. An applauding crowd hoists Joe away in praise, leaving his wheel chair empty. Stewie tries to unlock the "power of the wheelchair", but Lois puts a pacifier in his mouth and he quickly falls asleep. After the hostage situation, Peter is disappointed, but his family tells him that he is their hero.<ref name="Callaghan, p. 30">[[#FG|Callaghan]], p. 30</ref><ref name="Plot synopsis">Plot synopsis information for "A Hero Sits Next Door", in ''Family Guy: Volume 1''.

{{quote|I'm a huge fan of old radio dramas and I came up with this idea, when the show was still trying to find itself at the beginning, that the title of each episode would be a very ominous title borrowed from an old 40's suspense drama. And thus we had titles like "Death Has a Shadow" and "Mind Over Murder" that had nothing to do with the show. We realized that that kind of stopped being funny after four episodes. It's two in the morning and we're trying to come up with these things. So we kind of grew out of that and moved on to more traditional titles.|Seth MacFarlane|interview with [[IGN]]<ref name="TV Fest"/>}}

==Cultural references==
[[File:Ted Geisel NYWTS 2 crop.jpg|thumb|160px|left|[[Dr. Seuss]]' children's story ''[[How the Grinch Stole Christmas!]]'' was referenced.]]
In traditional ''Family Guy'' fashion, much of the humor in "A Hero Sits Next Door" stems from its [[Cutaway (filmmaking)|cutaway]]s, which generally feature references to popular culture. The ''[[Super Friends]]'' make an appearance in the episode when Peter references a time when he played [[strip poker]] in the [[Hall of Justice (comics)|Hall of Justice]]. After [[Wonder Woman]] loses and takes off her clothes, [[Robin (comics)|Robin]] simply stares at Peter instead of a naked Wonder Woman.<ref name="ign"/> The episode also makes a historical reference when a boy is showing his friend a [[Pez]] dispenser that looks like [[John F. Kennedy]]'s head. The dispenser is then destroyed by a policeman's bullet. The boy says, "Oh well, at least I still have my [[Robert F. Kennedy|Bobby Kennedy]] Pez dispenser", which is subsequently shot as well. This is a reference to the assassinations of both John and Robert Kennedy.<ref name=DVD>{{cite web |url=http://www.tvshowsondvd.com/releases/Family-Guy-Volume-Release/1666 |title= Family Guy&nbsp;<U+2014> Volume 1|accessdate=2010-04-03 |publisher=TVShowsonDVD.com }}</ref>

==Reception==
"A Hero Sits Next Door" received favorable reviews from television critics. In a 2008 review, Ahsan Haque of IGN praised the episode, rating it a 7.9/10 and calling it "a great introduction for Joe". He noted that the fight sequence between Joe and the Grinch "paved the road for many action sequences to come". He also praised the strong emphasis on storyline. He deemed some of the gags "classic" including the gag featuring the Super Friends.<ref name="ign"/> Robin Pierson of ''The TV Critic'' wrote a more mixed review, rating the episode a 55 out of 100; Pierson found the plot odd, stating that its twists were counter intuitive, causing them to be less funny and not stand out. He also felt the cutaway jokes were short and average. He commented positively on some of the jokes,<!--Like which ones?!--> and the inclusion of Peter's new neighbors saying they provided a new dynamic to the series.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thetvcritic.org/a-hero-sits-net-door/|title=Episode 5: A Hero Sits Next Door|work=The TV Critic|author=Pierson, Robin|date=2009-09-13|accessdate=2009-12-29}}</ref>
