Aikido is known for emphasizing the spiritual and philosophical development of its students.  This is a direct result of Ueshiba's background in the [[Oomoto|<U+014C>moto-ky<U+014D>]] religion.

==Spirit of Aikido==
The name '''aikido''' is formed of three Japanese characters,
* [[wikt:en:<U+5408>|<U+5408>]] - ''ai'' - joining
* [[wikt:en:<U+6C23>|<U+6C23>]] - ''ki'' - spirit
* [[wikt:en:<U+9053>|<U+9053>]] - ''d<U+014D>'' - way.
[[Image:PRehse002-cropped.jpg|right|thumb|300|Disarming an attacker using a ''tachi-dori'' ("sword-taking") technique.]]
''Aiki'' is a martial arts principle or tactic.  It typically describes an idea of oneness or blending in the midst of combat.  This principle finds expressions in such lethal concepts as ''ai uchi'' (<U+76F8><U+6483><U+3061>; "mutual strike/kill"), but in aikido it generally describes the more elevated notion of blending rather than clashing.  Emphasis is upon joining with the rhythm and intent of the opponent in order to find the optimal position and timing with which to apply force.

The techniques of aikido can, when applied judiciously, divert or immobilize rather than damage or kill.  As a result, some consider aikido to be a practical symbol of meeting aggression (physical, verbal, etc.) with an effective but merciful response, and finding harmony in conflict.  Ueshiba declared, "To control aggression without inflicting injury is the Art of Peace."<ref <ref name="AOP">The Art of Peace - a translation of selected "doka" (sayings) of Ueshiba by [[John Stevens]].</ref>

==History==
Morihei Ueshiba, also known by practitioners of aikido as ''[[Sensei|<U+014C>sensei]]'' ("Great Teacher"), developed aikido mainly from [[Daito-ryu aiki-jujutsu|Dait<U+014D>-ry<U+016B> aiki-j<U+016B>jutsu]], incorporating training movements such as those for the ''[[yari]]'' ([[spear]]), ''[[jo (weapon)|j<U+014D>]]'' (a short [[quarterstaff]]), and perhaps also ''juken'' ([[bayonet]]).  But arguably the strongest influence is that of ''[[kenjutsu]]'' and in many ways, an aikido practitioner moves as an empty handed swordsman.  Some schools of aikido do not do weapons training at all; others, such as [[Iwama Ryu|Iwama-ry<U+016B>]] usually spend substantial time with ''[[bokken]]'', ''[[jo (weapon)|j<U+014D>]]'', and ''[[tant<U+014D>]]'' (knife). In some lines of aikido, all techniques can be performed with a sword as well as unarmed.

Before his move to [[Hokkaid<U+014D>]] in [[1912]], the founder of aikido (born [[1883-12-14]]) had studied several martial arts.  It was here however, after he met [[Takeda Sokaku]] the reviver of Dait<U+014D>-ry<U+016B> aiki-j<U+016B>jutsu, that his martial art training took any real depth.  After Ueshiba left Hokkaid<U+014D> he came under the influence of [[Onisaburo Deguchi]], the spiritual leader of the [[Oomoto|Omoto-kyo]] sect in Ayabe.  In addition to the effect on his spiritual growth, this connection was to have a major effect in introducing Ueshiba to various elite political and military circles as a martial artist.  As a result of this exposure he was able to attract not only financial backing but also gifted students in their own right.  Several of these students went on to found their own styles of aikido (see Styles below).   

During the 1930's to 1942, when the name aikido was settled upon, the name of his art underwent a series of changes reflecting his growing distance from Takeda.

Aikido was first brought to the West in 1951 by [[Minoru Mochizuki]] with a visit to [[France]] where he introduced aikido techniques to judo students. He was followed by [[Tadashi Abe]] in 1952 who came as the official Aikikai Honbu representative, remaining in France for seven years. [[Kenji Tomiki]] toured with a delegation of various martial arts through fifteen continental states of the [[United States]] in 1953. Subsequently, in the same year, [[Koichi Tohei]] was sent by Aikikai Honbu for a full year to [[Hawaii]] setting up several dojo.  This was backed up by several further visits and is thus considered the formal introduction of aikido to the [[United States]].  The [[United Kingdom]] followed in 1955, [[Germany]] and [[Australia]] in 1965.  Today there are many aikido [[dojo]] available to train at throughout the world.

==Technique==
[[Image:aikido ikkyo.png|right|thumb|250|Diagram of ''ikky<U+014D>'', or "first technique".  ''Yonky<U+014D>'' has a similar mechanism of action, although the upper hand grips the forearm rather than the elbow.]]
Some common techniques and their [[Aikikai]] terminology:<ref>Aikido exercises for teaching and training' by C.M. Shifflett</ref>  

* '''Ikky<U+014D>-''' (first technique) a control using one hand on the elbow and one on near the wrist which [[leverage]]s ''uke'' to the ground. This grip also applies pressure into the [[ulnar nerve]] on the medial side of the arm.
* '''Niky<U+014D>-''' (second technique) an [[Wristlock#Adductive wristlock|adductive wristlock]] that torques the arm and applies painful nerve pressure.
* '''Sanky<U+014D>-''' (third technique) a [[Wristlock#Pronating wristlock|pronating]] technique that directs upward-spiraling tension throughout the arm, elbow and shoulder.
* '''Yonky<U+014D>-''' (fourth technique)  a shoulder control similar to ''ikky<U+014D>'' (see illustration), but with both hands gripping the forearm.  The knuckles (from the palm side) are applied to the recipient's [[radial nerve]] against the [[periosteum]] of the forearm bone.
* '''Goky<U+014D>-''' (fifth technique) a variant of ikky<U+014D> in which the hand gripping the wrist is inverted.  Common in [[tanto]] and other weapon take-aways.
* '''Shih<U+014D>nage'''- (four-direction throw) The hand is folded back past the shoulder, locking the shoulder joint.
* '''Kotegaeshi'''- (wrist return) a [[Wristlock#Supinating wristlock|supinating]] wristlock-throw that stretches the [[extensor digitorum]].
* '''Koky<U+016B>nage'''- (breath throw) a term for various types of flowing "timing throws".
* '''Iriminage'''- (entering-body throw) throws in which ''nage'' moves through the space occupied by ''uke''.  The classic form superficially resembles a "clothesline" technique.
* '''Tenchinage'''- (heaven-and-earth throw) From ''uke'' grabbing both wrists of ''nage''.  Moving forward, ''nage'' sweeps one hand low ("earth") and the other high ("heaven"), which unbalances ''uke'' so that he or she easily topples over.
* '''Koshinage'''- (hip throw) aikido's version of the [[throw (grappling)#Hip throws|hip throw]].  ''Nage'' drops his or her hips lower than those of ''uke'', then flips ''uke'' over the resultant [[fulcrum]].
* '''J<U+016B>jinage'''- (shaped-like-'ten'-throw) a throw that locks the arms against each other.  (The ''kanji'' for "10" is a cross-shape.)
* '''Kaitennage'''- (rotation throw) ''nage'' sweeps the arm back until it locks the shoulder joint, then uses forward pressure to throw.

===Implementations===

[[Image:Aikido ikkyo omote ura.png|right|thumb|250|Diagram showing ''omote'' and ''ura'' applications of ''ikky<U+014D>''.]]

Aikido makes use of ''[[tai sabaki]]'', or body movement, to blend with ''uke''. An ''irimi'' (entering-body) style technique consists of movements inward towards ''uke'', while ''tenkan'' (turning) style uses a pivoting motion.<ref>[http://www.aikidojournal.com/article.php?articleID=686 An article by Ellis Amdur on the conceptions of ''irimi'' and ''tenkan''.]</ref>  An ''uchi'' ("inside") technique takes place in front of ''uke'', whereas a ''soto'' ("outside") technique takes place to his side; an ''omote'' technique is applied in front, whereas an ''ura'' version is applied using a turning motion; and most techniques can be performed while in [[seiza]] (seated).  (Seated techniques are called ''suwari-waza''.)

Thus, from less than twenty basic techniques, there are thousands of possible implementations.  For instance, ikky<U+014D> can be applied to an opponent moving forward with a strike (perhaps an ''ura-waza'' type of movement to redirect the incoming force), or to an opponent who has already struck and is now moving back to reestablish distance (perhaps an ''omote-waza'' version).  Specific aikido ''[[kata]]'' are typically referred to with the formula "attack-technique(-modifier)".  For instance, ''katate-dori ikky<U+014D>'' refers to any ''ikky<U+014D>'' technique executed when ''uke'' is holding one wrist.  This could be further specified as ''katate-dori ikky<U+014D> omote(-waza)'', referring to any forward-moving ''ikky<U+014D>'' technique from that grab.

===Atemi===
''[[Atemi]]'' are strikes (or [[feint]]s) employed during an aikido technique.  Some view ''atemi'' as attacks against [[pressure point|"vital points"]] meant to cause damage in and of themselves.  For instance, [[Gozo Shioda]] describes using ''atemi'' in a brawl to quickly down a gang's leader.<ref name="Shugyo">Aikido Shugyo by [[Gozo Shioda]]</ref>  Others consider ''atemi'', especially to the face, to be methods of distraction meant to enable other techniques.  A strike, whether or not it is blocked, can startle the target and break his or her concentration.  The target may also become unbalanced in attempting to avoid the blow, for example by jerking the head back, which may allow for an easier throw.  

Many sayings about ''atemi'' are attributed to Morihei Ueshiba, who considered them an essential element of technique. <ref>[http://www.tsuki-kage.com/ueshiba.html Ueshiba's quotations on atemi]</ref>

===Attacks===
Students will learn the various attacks from which an aikido technique can be practiced. Although attacks aren't studied as thoroughly as in striking-based arts, honest attacks (a strong strike or an immobilizing grab) are needed to study correct and effective application of technique.

=====Strikes=====
The ''uchi'' strikes of aikido are often said to resemble blows from a [[sword]] or other grasped object, which may suggest origins in techniques intended for [[weapon|armed]] combat.  [[Kick]]s are generally reserved for upper-level variations: reasons cited include that falls from kicks are especially dangerous, and that kicks (high kicks in particular) were uncommon during the types of combat prevalent in feudal Japan.
* '''Sh<U+014D>men'uchi'''- (front-face-strike) a vertical [[Strike (attack)#Knife hand|knife-hand strike]] to the head.
* '''Yokomen'uchi'''- (side-face-strike) a diagonal [[Strike (attack)#Knife hand|knife-hand strike]] to the side of the head or neck.
* '''Mune-tsuki'''- (chest-thrust) a [[Punch (strike)|punch]] to the [[torso]]. Specific targets include the [[chest]], [[abdomen]], and [[solar plexus]].
* '''Ganmen-tsuki'''- (face-thrust) a [[Punch (strike)|punch]] to the [[face]].

=====Grabs=====
Beginners in particular often practice techniques from grabs, both because they are safer and because it is easier to feel the energy and lines of force of a hold than a strike.  Some grabs are historically derived from being held while trying to draw a weapon; a technique could then be used to free oneself and immobilize or strike the grabbing person.

The ''kata-'' (single-) prefixed forms are listed below.  The prefix ''ry<U+014D>-'' indicates "both" instead; e.g., ''katate-dori'' (single-hand-grab) becomes ''ry<U+014D>te-dori'' (both-hands-grab).  (Note: another ''[[kanji]]'', [[wikt:en:<U+80A9>|<U+80A9>]], also pronounced ''kata'', means "shoulder", which may lead to some confusion.)  Common variants include ''mochi'' instead of ''dori''.
* '''Katate-dori'''- (single-hand-grab) one hand grabs one wrist.
* '''Morote-dori'''- (both-hands-grab) both hands grab one wrist.
* '''Ry<U+014D>te-dori'''- (both-hands-grab) both hands grab both wrists. (sometimes called ''ry<U+014D>katate-dori'')
* '''Kata-dori'''- (shoulder-grab) a shoulder grab.  (both-shoulders-grab is ''ry<U+014D>kata-dori'')
* '''Mune-dori'''- (chest-grab) grabbing the (clothing of the) chest.

===Ukemi===
''Ukemi'' (lit. "receiving-body"), is a martial arts term for protective techniques, such as parries or safe falls.  One of the first skills taught to beginning students of aikido is how to land when thrown so as to avoid injury.  Familiarity with different types of [[breakfall]]s allows sincere execution of techniques that could otherwise be prohibitively dangerous.  In applying the technique, it is the responsibility of ''nage'' to prevent injury to ''uke'' by employing a speed and force of application that commensurate with their partner's proficiency in ''ukemi''.

===Kata===
Aikido training is based primarily on two person [[kata]] rather than [[randori]].  ''Uke'', the receiver of the technique, usually initiates an attack against ''nage'' (also referred to as ''tori'' or ''shite'' depending on aikido style), who neutralises this attack with an aikido technique. 

Both halves of the technique, that of ''uke'' and that of ''nage'', are considered essential to aikido training.  Both are studying aikido principles of blending and adaptation, applied from different sides of the technique.  ''Nage'' learns to blend with and control attacking energy, while ''uke'' learns to become calm and flexible in the disadvantageous, off-balance positions in which ''nage'' places them.  (This "receiving" of the technique is called ''ukemi''.)  ''Uke'' continuously seeks to regain balance and cover vulnerabilities (e.g. an exposed side), while ''nage''  uses position and timing to keep ''uke'' off-balance and vulnerable.  In more advanced training, ''uke'' will sometimes apply ''kaeshi-waza''  ("reversal techniques") to regain their balance and pin or throw ''nage''.

===Randori===
One unique feature of aikido is training for multiple attackers. Randori, or jiy<U+016B>waza (freestyle) practice done with multiple attackers, is a key part of most curriculae and is required for the higher level ranks. ''Randori'' exercises a person's ability to intuitively perform techniques in an unstructured environment.  Strategic choice of techniques, based upon how they reposition the student relative to other attackers, is important in randori training.  For instance, an ''ura'' technique might be used to neutralise the current attacker while turning to face attackers approaching from behind.

[[Shodokan Aikido]] ''randori'' differs in that it is not done with multiple persons, but between two people with both participants able to attack, defend and resist at will. As in [[judo]], the role of ''uke'' and ''nage'' does not exist.

===Weapons===
Weapons training in aikido usually includes wooden ''[[jo (weapon)|j<U+014D>]]'', ''[[bokken]]'', and ''[[tant<U+014D>]]''. Both weapon-taking and weapon-retention are sometimes taught, to integrate armed and unarmed aspects.

==Ranking==
The vast majority of aikido styles use the ''[[ky<U+016B>]]''/''[[dan rank|dan]]'' ranking system common to ''[[gendai budo|gendai bud<U+014D>]]'', however the actual requirements for each belt level differs between styles, so they are not necessarily comparable or interchangeable. Some organisations of aikido use coloured belts for ky<U+016B> levels, and some do not.

==Clothing==
The ''[[aikidogi|aikid<U+014D>gi]]'' used in aikido is similar to the ''[[keikogi]]'' used in most other modern [[budo|bud<U+014D>]] arts; simple trousers and a wraparound jacket, usually white.  Both [[judo]]- and [[karate]]-style ''gi'' are in use; the former having a thicker weave than the latter.  (This additional durability is important in judo to avoid tearing when the jacket is seized as part of a throw, which can sometimes be a concern in aikido practice as well.) Specialized aikido uniforms are rare; they typically are modified to have heavier knee-patches, to withstand stress from techniques done in [[seiza]] posture.

Most aikido systems add the ''[[hakama]]'' to the ''keikogi''. The ''hakama'' is usually black or indigo, and is often reserved for practitioners with ''dan'' (black belt) ranks. However, some schools allow all students to wear them regardless of rank,  some permit only female practitioners to don them before attaining ''dan'' ranks, and others allow all students to wear the hakama from a specified kyu rank. Similarly, some schools use a variety of belt colors, while others use only white for ky<U+016B> grades and black for dan grades, with perhaps the addition of a brown belt for the upper few ky<U+016B> ranks.

==Ki==
[[Image:ki-obsolete.png|left|float|200px|Obsolete form of the ki kanji]]
The Japanese character for ''[[Qi|ki]]'', (''[[Qi]]'' in Chinese) is a symbolic representation of a lid covering a pot full of rice. The steam being contained within, is ''ki''. This same word is applied to the ability to harness one's own 'breath power', 'power', or 'energy'. Teachers describe ''ki'' as coming from the ''[[Tanden|hara]]'', situated in the lower abdomen, about two inches below and behind the navel. In training these teachers emphasize that one should remain "centered". 

The precise meaning of ''ki'' within aikido is the subject of debate amongst the various disciplines and teachers.  Ueshiba himself appears to have changed his views over time, and styles originating from each of those periods bear certain associated marks.  For example, [[Yoshinkan]] Aikido, which largely follows Ueshiba's teachings from before the war, is considerably more martial in nature, reflecting a younger, more violent, and less "spiritual" man.  For example, Gozo Shioda, having analyzed the techniques of aikido, decided that the secret to ''kokyu'', or "breath power", lay in the use of timing and the application of the whole body's strength to one point.<ref name="Shugyo"/>  As Ueshiba evolved and his views changed, his teachings took on a much more ethereal feel, and many of his later students teach about ''ki'' from this perspective.

==Body==
Physical training goals pursued in conjunction with aikido include relaxation, flexibility, and endurance, with less emphasis on weightlifting-style strength.  In aikido technique, pushing or extending movements are much more common than pulling or contracting movements, and this distinction can be applied to general fitness goals as well.

Some fitness activities, for example weight-lifting, emphasize contractionary power, in which specific muscles or muscle groups are isolated and worked to improve tone, mass, and power.  Aikido-related training instead emphasizes the use of coordinated whole-body movement and balance, more similar to something like [[yoga]] or [[pilates]].  For example, conditioning methods used during aikido classes often include repetitions of [[breakfall]]s, or sustained randori.

==Mind==
Aikido training is mental as well as physical, emphasizing the ability to relax the mind and body even under the stress of dangerous situations.  This is necessary in order to enable the bold enter-and-blend movements that underlie aikido techniques, wherein an attack is met with confidence and directness.  Morihei Ueshiba once remarked that one "must be willing to receive 99% of an opponent's attack and stare death in the face" in order to execute technique.<ref name="AOP"/>  As a [[budo]] concerned not only with fighting proficiency but also with the betterment of daily life, this mental aspect is of key importance to aikido practitioners.

==Styles==
The major styles of aikido each have their own ''[[honbu dojo]]'' in [[Japan]], have an international breadth, and were founded by direct students of [[Morihei Ueshiba]].  Although there has been an explosion of "independent styles" generally only the first six listed are considered major.

*[[Yoshinkan]] founded by [[Gozo Shioda]], has a reputation for being the most rigidly precise.
*[[Yoseikan]] was founded by [[Minoru Mochizuki]], who was an early student of Ueshiba and also of [[Jigoro Kano]] at the [[Kodokan]].   
*[[Shodokan Aikido]] founded by [[Kenji Tomiki]], use sparring and rule based competition in training as opposed to most others.
*The [[Ki Society]] founded by [[Koichi Tohei]], emphasizes soft flowing techniques and has a special program for developing ''[[ki]]''. 
*[[Iwama style]] emphasizes the relation between weapon techniques and barehand techniques. 
*[[Shin'ei Taido]] founded by the late [[Noriaki Inoue]], nephew of Morihei Ueshiba.    
*[[Yoshokai]] Aikido, founded by [[Takashi Kushida]], a Yoshinkan aikido senior instructor.
*[[Tendo-ryu Aikido|Tendoryu Aikido]] Headed by [[Kenji Shimizu]].
*[[Shin Budo Kai]] headed by [[Shizuo Imaizumi]].
*[[Kokikai]] Aikido, founded by [[Shuji Maruyama]] in 1986.
*[[Seidokan]] Aikido, founded by [[Rod Kobayashi]].
*[[Nippon Kan]] Headed by [[Gaku Homma]].
*[[Nishio Aikido]] a part of the Aikikai although techically well defined according to its head [[Shoji Nishio]].
*[[Takemusu Aiki Tomita Academy]]. Academy for the development of Takemusu Aiki founded in 1992 by [[Takeji Tomita]].

*[[Fugakukai International Association]].  Has roots in the Shodokan style, but without the competition element.

The above styles can trace their lineage through senior students back to the founder of aikido, Morihei Ueshiba.  Two further well known martial arts use the name aikido but do not have this direct connection.  They are [[Korindo Aikido]] founded by [[Minoru Hirai]] and Nihon Goshin Aikido founded by Shodo Morita.  These schools, with some historical justification, suggest that the name aikido is not the exclusive domain of arts derived from the teachings of Morihei Ueshiba.<!--  Schools of [[Daito-ryu aiki-jujutsu]] have referred to themselves as aikido in the past and it is called [[hapkido]] though the aikido exported to [[South Korea]] uses the same kanji. -->

==Aikidoka==
It is sometimes said that in  [[Japan]] the term ''aikidoka'' (<U+5408><U+6C17><U+9053><U+5BB6>) mainly refers to a [[professional]], while in the west, anyone who practices may call themselves an ''aikid<U+014D>ka''. The term ''aikidoist'' is also used as a more general term, especially by those who prefer to maintain the more restricted, Japanese, meaning of the term ''aikidoka''.
