The '''Siege of Middelburg (1572-1574)''' was a siege that lasted two years and took place in the years between 1572 and 1574 during the [[Eighty Years' War]] and the [[Anglo-Spanish War (1585<U+2013>1604)]]. A Dutch rebel army with the support of English laid siege to Middelburg which was being held by Spanish forces under [[Crist<U+00F3>bal de Mondrag<U+00F3>n]]. The Spanish held out and only capitulated when news of the relief effort to save Middleburg was [[Battle of Reimerswaal|defeated at Rimmerswiel]].<ref name=autogenerated3>Motley pg 527-29</ref>

==Background==
The [[capture of Brielle]] by the Dutch rebels known as [[Geuzen]] or ''Beggars'' caused a sensation, and a chain reaction of events took place especially on [[Walcheren]] island. After Brielle had been captured this soon led to the [[Uprising of Vlissingen|seizure of]] the town of [[Vlissingen|Flushing]]. The rebels supported by English troops wreaked havoc by looting properties and torching churches. Many villages on the island thus fell into their hands, and also towns like [[Arnemuiden]] and [[Veere]] were handed over by the inhabitants sympathetic to the rebel cause.<ref name=autogenerated1>Knight, Charles Raleigh: ''Historical records of The Buffs, East Kent Regiment (3rd Foot) formerly designated the Holland Regiment and Prince George of Denmark's Regiment''.

During the uprising Middelburg still had a strong Spanish garrison and at the end of April 1572 an attempted assault was made consisting of around 1100 Dutch rebels led by Jerome Tseraerts. Due to lack of resources and support they pulled back after a day suffering losses where they then resorted to looting the outside of the city. In June another attempt was made again, this time by only a hundred Dutch rebels. Led by Bernard Nicholas the storming attempt was successful as the outer defenses were seized but soon after a sortie by the garrison managed to drive the Dutch out. Middelburg was not yet besieged and the Spanish were able to supply the city without any hindrance. On November 4 nearly 1500 Dutch and English under Jerome Tseraerts and [[Bartholt Entens van Mentheda]] who just returned from the [[Relief of Goes|failed siege of Goes]] arrived on the island of Walcharen and then made plans to besiege Middelburg.<ref name=Elliot139></ref>

==Siege==
The waterways around the city were soon blocked, which soon caused supplies to run low for the Middelburg inhabitants.<ref name=autogenerated2>{{cite book|last=Scott|first=Sir Walter|title=A Collection of Scarce and Valuable Tracts, on the Most Interesting and Entertaining Subjects: Prior to the reign of Queen Elizabeth Volume 1|publisher=T.

Tseraerts was commissioned to be Lieutenant-Governor of the whole of the island of Walcharen. They appeared at the castle of Westhoven, located on the east of the city, Tseraerts led an assault which it captured, then plundered an abbey and then set it on fire. The governor of Walcheren, Antoine of Burgundy, wrote repeatedly to the [[Fernando <U+00C1>lvarez de Toledo, 3rd Duke of Alba|Duke of Alba]] Governor of the Netherlands on behalf of [[Philip II of Spain]] to report on the situation in the city which was becoming increasingly difficult with the siege. Alba ordered [[Crist<U+00F3>bal de Mondrag<U+00F3>n]] to go to Middelburg and destroy the Anglo-Dutch siege positions and restore the supply lines. Mondrag<U+00F3>n meanwhile was to take over the administration of the city itself and as a result Antoine of Burgundy stepped down to become the mayor of Middelburg.<ref name=autogenerated2 /> 

In early December [[Sancho d'Avila]] arrived from [[Antwerp]], the Duke of Alba, ordered him to send reinforcements by sea.<ref>Davies p.590</ref> He assembled a fleet at [[Breskens]] and hoped to capture Flushing from the Beggars and seize the waterways in Walcheren from the rebels. D'Avila also sent some companies via land to Middelburg and managed to supply the city. He was on his way to Flushing but was intercepted and [[Battle of Flushing|defeated there]] by [[Lieven Keersmaker]] losing five ships.<ref>Moltey 413</ref>

===1573===
At the beginning of 1573 the Dutch managed to capture the castle at [[Popkensburg]], just outside the northern part of Middelburg. Meanwhile, within the city walls food shortages were strongly felt as the bitter winter lasted. As well as the population suffering, the Spanish soldiers too had very little in terms of consumption. People in the city that were of little use, such as paupers and people dying of disease, were left outside to save food. In late July after the failure to [[Siege of Haarlem|relieve Haarlem]] [[William the Silent|William of Orange]] took over proceedings from Tseraerts.<ref name=autogenerated3 />  

On August 5, the nearby [[Fort Rammekens]] was assaulted and captrued by the Dutch and English led by Jacob Schotte and gradually the strong points were being conquered slowly one by one.<ref name=autogenerated2 /> Around Christmas the food shortage was so dire that between 1000 and 1500 civilians and soldiers died by the end of the year.<ref name=autogenerated3 /> 

===1574===
The situation was desperate in January 1574 with Middelburg still besieged, the Duke of Alba was recalled by the Spanish king and was replaced by [[Don Luis de Requesens]]. De Requesens ordered the relief of Middelburg and he assembled a fleet of seventy ships under [[Julian Romero]] at [[Bergen op Zoom]] in addition from Antwerp, Sancho d'Avila with a hundred ships would join Romero.<ref name=autogenerated3 /> The [[Battle of Reimerswaal|operation however was a fiasco]]; they departed but before they even got to Middelburg they were set upon by the Sea Beggars who boarded all sides of the ships. Not one ship managed to make it to Middelburg and this was a huge blow to the Spanish.<ref name=autogenerated2 />

In early February, the city for at least twelve days had no food; Mondrag<U+00F3>n sent several messengers to Requesens, but never got an answer back, because the messengers with letters were intercepted. On February 4 Mondrag<U+00F3>n received a personal message from William of Orange; he had to surrender the city within four days. Meanwhile, to add to Mondrag<U+00F3>n's woes there was a bigger influx of Dutch, English and Scots troops who now surrounded the city.<ref name=autogenerated1 />

===Capitulation===
The hardened Mondrag<U+00F3>n refused to surrender and as a sign he set fire to a few houses and sent a messenger to William to let him know that dozens of locations in the city would be set on fire and he would go down fighting. William of Orange came up with a compromise and proposed a negotiation in Fort Rammekens with the conditions; an honorable capitulation and a 'retreat' with arms & colors.<ref name=autogenerated3 /> Mondrag<U+00F3>n was now concerned about the inhabitants given the light of recent events of which he was fully aware of the Spanish massacres of the populaces of [[Haarlem]], [[Naarden]] and [[Zutphen]] ordered by the Duke of Alba. He pleaded with the Prince that the inhabitants and the clergy were not to be harmed, and when this was agreed both William of Orange and Mondrag<U+00F3>n signed a transfer on February 18th. On February 23rd the now ill fed poorly equipped Spanish garrison left the city of Middelburg along with the Catholic clergy.<ref name=autogenerated3 />

==Aftermath==
With the surrender of Middelburg, the whole of the island of Walcheren, which commands the two mouths of the [[Scheldt]], was finally lost to the Dutch and English. The town of [[Leiden]], which [[Siege of Leiden|had been invested]] by the Spanish since November 1573, still held out for William of Orange.<ref name=autogenerated /> Mondrag<U+00F3>n took his defeated and later mutinous army to [[Zuid-Beveland|Beveland]] and the following year he captured [[Duiveland]] and then [[Siege of Zierikzee (1576)|took Zierikzee]]. After the siege was over Jacob Schotte was rewarded by William of Orange and was appointed mayor of Middelburg.<ref name=autogenerated4 />{{rp|155}}

[[George Gascoigne]] an English soldier-poet who too part in the siege received a 300 [[Dutch gulden|gulden]] above his pay by William for his part in the Spanish surrender.<ref>Wilson pg. 155</ref>

Observing the capitulation Gascoigne wrote a poem:<ref>{{cite book|last=de Vries|first=Tiemen|title=Holland's Influence on English Language and Literature|year=1916|publisher=Grentzebach|location=Chicago|page=203|url=http://www.dbnl.org/tekst/vrie035holl01_01/vrie035holl01_01_0028.php}}</ref>
