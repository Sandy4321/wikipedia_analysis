The '''XV-8 Flexible Wing Aerial Utility Vehicle''' (nicknamed '''Fleep''', short for "Flying Jeep") was an aircraft built by [[Ryan Aeronautical Company]] in collaboration with [[NASA]] for the [[U.S. Air Force]] and the [[U.S. Army]] and tested as a STOL patrol and reconnaissance utility aircraft in 1961. The wing was a fabric delta-shaped [[Rogallo wing]] with a foldable frame with inflatable leading edge and the wing was attached to a podlike cockpit on a tri-gear platform; Two tail configurations: vertical fin and V-tail. It folded into a relatively small package for transport.
