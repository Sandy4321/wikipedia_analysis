The '''123rd Outram's Rifles''' was an [[infantry]] [[regiment]] of the [[British Indian Army]].

==History==
It traced its origins to the [[12th Regiment of Bombay Native Infantry]], part of the [[British East India Company]]'s [[Bombay Army]]. It fought in the [[Battle of Khadki|Battle of Kirkee]] on [[5 November]] [[1817]] in the [[Third Anglo-Maratha War]] and became the regiment's 1st Battalion in [[1820]]. It was made a separate regiment in [[1824]], titled the '''23rd Regiment of Bombay Native Infantry'''. 

The regiment took part in the [[First Anglo-Afghan War]] in [[1839]] and was renamed as the '''23rd Regiment of Bombay Native Light Infantry''' in [[1841]] . Just before the [[Indian Mutiny]] began in [[1857]], the 23rd took part in the [[Anglo-Persian War]] between [[1856]]-[[1857]]. During the Indian Mutiny, the regiment remained loyal, like nearly all of the [[Bombay Army]].

The regiment took part in the [[Second Anglo-Afghan War]] from [[1879]] and the [[Third Anglo-Burmese War]] from [[1885]] to the end of the war in [[1887]]. It dropped "native" from its title in 1885 and was designated a [[rifle regiment]] in [[1889]], to become the '''23rd Regiment (2nd Rifle Regiment) of Bombay Infantry'''. 

In the early [[1900s]] the regiment saw service against [[Mohammed Abdullah Hassan|Mohammed bin Abdullah]] (known as the "Mad Mullah" to the British) and his followers in [[British Somaliland]], while a company was sent to [[Aden]] in [[1903]]. The 1900s also brought change to its title. It became the '''23rd Bombay Rifles''' in [[1901]] and after the [[Kitchener reforms]] of the Indian force, it became the '''123rd Outram's Rifles''' in [[1903]]. The renaming was in honour of Lieutenant-General [[James Outram (British officer)|Sir James Outram]] who had served with the regiment as its first [[adjutant]].

===First World War===
The regiment raised further battalions during the course of [[World War I]], seeing extensive service in the [[Middle East]], with some soldiers attached to other units. Many of the regiment's soldiers also saw service on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]] while attached to other units. 

After the [[Sinai and Palestine Campaign|Palestine campaign]] began in [[1917]], the regiment joined the [[British 234th Brigade|234th Brigade]], [[British 75th Division|75th Division]]. Outram's Rifles were involved in, among others, the [[Third Battle of Gaza]], begun on [[31 October]] 1917, and the [[Battle of Megiddo (1918)|Megiddo Offensive]] in September [[1918]]. War came to an end in the Middle East with the signing of an [[Armistice]] with the Ottomans on [[30 October]] 1918.

===Post-War===
After the war ended, the regiment was involved in efforts to quell an [[Arab]] rebellion that broke out in [[1920]] in the [[British Mandate of Iraq]] against the British administration.

As part of the reforms of the Indian forces, Outram's Rifles were amalgamated with five other regiments in [[1922]], to form the [[6th Rajputana Rifles]]. The 123rd became the '''4th Battalion (Outram's)'''.
