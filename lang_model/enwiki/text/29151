'''''Hybrid Theory''''' is the [[debut album]] by the American [[nu metal]] band [[Linkin Park]]. Released on [[October 24]] [[2000]] through [[Warner Bros. Records]], the album was a commercial success, peaking at #2 in the U.S. [[The Billboard 200|Billboard 200]] and reaching high positions in [[Record chart|charts]] worldwide, despite receiving mixed reviews from publications. Recorded at NRG Recordings in [[North Hollywood]], [[California]] and produced by [[Don Gilmore]], the album's lyrical themes deal with problems lead vocalist [[Chester Bennington]] experienced during his adolescence, including [[drug abuse]] and the constant fighting and divorce of his parents. 

Four [[Single (music)|singles]] were released from the album: <U+201C>[[Papercut (song)|Papercut]]<U+201D>, <U+201C>[[In The End]],<U+201D> <U+201C>[[One Step Closer (Linkin Park song)|One Step Closer]]<U+201D>, and the [[Grammy Award]]-winning <U+201C>[[Crawling (song)|Crawling]]<U+201D>, the latter three of which were responsible for launching Linkin Park into mainstream popularity. Since its release, ''Hybrid Theory'' has been certified [[RIAA certification#List of certifications|diamond]] by the [[Recording Industry Association of America|RIAA]], and to date has sold 24 million copies worldwide, making it the best-selling debut album of the [[21st century]]. At the [[44th Grammy Awards|2002 Grammy Awards]], it was nominated for [[Grammy Award for Best Rock Album|Best Rock Album]]. 

== Background ==
Linkin Park was formed in 1999 when lead vocalist Chester Bennington joined the five members of the [[Rock music|rock]] [[Music ensemble|arrangement]] [[Xero (rock band)|Xero]]: Guitarist [[Brad Delson]], [[Rapping|MC]] [[Mike Shinoda]], drummer [[Rob Bourdon]], turntablist [[Joe Hahn]], and bassist [[Dave Farrell]]. Bennington's [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]] band Grey Daze had recently disbanded, so his lawyer recommended him to [[Jeff Blue]], vice president of [[A&R]] coordination for [[Zomba Label Group|Zomba]], who at the time was seeking a lead vocalist for Xero. Blue sent Bennington two tapes of Xero's unreleased recordings &mdash; one with vocals by former Xero member Mark Wakefield, and the other with only the instrumental tracks &mdash; asking for his "interpretation of the songs."<ref name="rolling stone 2002" /> Bennington wrote and recorded new vocals over the instrumentals and sent the tapes back to Blue.<ref name="band bio">{{Cite web|url=http://www.lpassociation.com/bios/band|title=Everybody loves a success story.|accessdate=2007-08-08|publisher=''The LP Association''}}</ref> As Delson recalls, Bennington "was kind of the final piece of the puzzle [...] We didn't see anything close to his talent in anybody else."<ref name="rhythm" /> After Bennington joined, the group first renamed itself to Hybrid Theory and released a [[Hybrid Theory EP|self-titled EP]]. Legal complications with [[Wales|Welsh]] [[electronic music]] [[Record producer|producers]] [[Hybrid (producers)|Hybrid]] prompted a second name change, this time to Linkin Park.<ref name="rolling stone 2002" /><ref name="time">{{Cite web|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1001709-2,00.html|title=Linkin Park biography describing origin of name|accessdate=2007-08-14|author=Tyrangiel, Josh|publisher=''Time.com''}}</ref> Throughout 1999, Linkin Park was a regular act at the [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]] club [[Whisky a Go Go|The Whisky]].<ref name="vh1">{{Cite web|url=http://www.vh1.com/artists/az/linkin_park/bio.jhtml|title=Linkin Park biography|accessdate=2007-08-14|publisher=''VH1.com''}}</ref>

== Music ==
=== Recording and production ===
The music that would ultimately become the ''Hybrid Theory'' album was first produced by Linkin Park in 1999 as a nine-track [[Demo (music)|demo]] tape. The band sent this tape to various recording companies and played forty-two different showcases for recording industry representatives.<ref name="band bio" /><ref name="band discog">{{Cite web|url=http://www.lpassociation.com/music/disco|title=Complete Linkin Park discography|accessdate=2007-08-09|publisher=''The LP Association''}}</ref> However, they were initially turned down by most major, and several [[Independent record label|independent]] record labels.<ref name="rolling stone 2002" /> The band was signed by [[Warner Bros. Records]] in 2000, due in large part to the constant recommendations of Jeff Blue, who had joined the label after resigning from Zomba.<ref name="rolling stone 2002" /><ref name="band bio"/><ref name="rhythm">{{Cite web|url=http://www.madison.com/rhythm/stories/rhythmstory-020131.php|title=Linkin Park interview with Rhythm|accessdate=2007-08-15|author=Sculley, Alan|publisher=''Madison.com''}}</ref>

[[Image:Linkin park sin Phoenix.jpg|left|243px|thumb|Linkin Park without [[Dave Farrell|Dave <U+201C>Phoenix<U+201D> Farrell]] during the ''Hybrid Theory'' era.]]
Despite initial difficulties in finding a [[Record producer|producer]] willing to take charge of the debut album of a newly signed band, [[Don Gilmore]] ultimately agreed to head up the project,<ref name="band bio" /> with [[Andy Wallace (producer)|Andy Wallace]] hired as the [[mixer]]. Recording sessions, which mostly involved re-recording the songs off the demo tape, began at NRG Recordings in North Hollywood, California and lasted four weeks.<ref name="band bio" /> The rap sections in most of the songs were significantly altered from the original, while most choruses remained largely unchanged.<ref name="band demos">{{Cite web|url=http://www.lpassociation.com/music/demos|title=Linkin Park demos|accessdate=2007-08-19|publisher=''The LP Association''}}</ref> Due to the absence of Dave Farrell, the band hired [[Scott Koziol]] and [[Ian Hornbeck]] as stand-in bassists; Delson also played [[Bass guitar|bass]] throughout most of the album. The [[Dust Brothers]] provided additional [[Beat (music)|beats]] for the track <U+201C>With You<U+201D>.

Bennington and Shinoda wrote the lyrics to ''Hybrid Theory'' based in part on early demos by Mark Wakefield.<ref name="rolling stone 2002">Fricke, David. <U+201C>Rap Metal Rulers<U+201D>, ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' No. 891, [[March 14]], [[2002]]</ref> Shinoda characterized the lyrics as interpretations of universal feelings, emotions, and experiences, and as <U+201C>everyday emotions you talk about and think about.<U+201D><ref name="bbc session">[[BBC Radio 1]], Evening Session Interview with [[Steve Lamacq]], [[June 13]], [[2001]]</ref><ref name="text bbc session">{{Cite web|url=http://lptimes.com/article/BBC_061301.html|title=BBC Session Interview|accessdate=2007-09-19|publisher=''LP Times''}}</ref> Bennington later described the songwriting experience to ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine in early 2002:

{{cquote|It's easy to fall into that thing&mdash;'poor, poor me,' that's where songs like 'Crawling' come from: I can't take myself. But that song is about taking responsibility for your actions. I don't say 'you' at any point. It's about how I'm the reason that I feel this way. There's something inside me that pulls me down.|||Chester Bennington|''Rolling Stone Magazine, 2002''<ref name="rolling stone 2002" />}}

The music of ''Hybrid Theory'' draws from diverse inspirations. Bennington's singing style is influenced by acts such as [[Depeche Mode]] and [[Stone Temple Pilots]],<ref name="rolling stone 2002" /> while the guitar riffs and playing techniques of guitarist [[Brad Delson]] are modeled after the [[Deftones]], [[Guns N' Roses]],<ref name="band bio" /> [[U2]], and [[The Smiths]].<ref name="rolling stone 2002" /> The lyrical content of the songs primarily touch upon the problems that Bennington encountered during his childhood, including [[child abuse]], constant and excessive [[Drug abuse|drug]] and [[alcohol abuse]],<ref name="rolling stone 2002" /> the [[divorce]] of his parents, [[Social isolation|isolation]],<ref name="chaz bio">{{Cite web|url=http://www.lpassociation.com/bios/chester|title=Chester Bennington biography|accessdate=2007-08-19|publisher=''The LP Association''}}</ref> disappointments, and the aftermath feelings of failed relationships.<ref name="sharpened review">{{Cite web|url=http://www.sharpened.net/reviews/musicreview.php?Linkin_Park_Hybrid_Theory|title=Sharpened review|accessdate=2007-08-19|publisher=''Sharpened.net''}}</ref>

The album eventually produced four singles. <U+201C>[[One Step Closer (Linkin Park song)|One Step Closer]],<U+201D> the album's second track and first single, was gradually recorded in increments after Linkin Park struggled with <U+201C>Runaway,<U+201D><ref name="osc">{{Cite web|url=http://www.songfacts.com/detail.php?id=1673|title=One Step Closer facts|accessdate=2007-09-29|publisher=''Song Facts}}</ref> and features an iconic guitar riff and [[Electronic drum|electronic percussion]] in the introduction transitioning into a [[bridge (music)|bridge]] with distortion-heavy guitars and aggressive drums.<ref name="sputnikmusic">{{Cite web|url=http://www.sputnikmusic.com/album.php?albumid=173|title=Sputnikmusic review|accessdate=2007-09-29|publisher=''Sputnikmusic''}}</ref> It is also infamous for the <U+201C>Shut up when I'm talking to you<U+201D> [[refrain]] [[Screaming (music)|screamed]] by Bennington one minute and 48 seconds into the song.<ref name="sputnikmusic" /><ref name="popmatters" /> The music video for <U+201C>One Step Closer<U+201D> was shot in a [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]] [[Los Angeles County Metro Rail|subway]]<ref name="osc vid" /> and became an instant hit, eventually receiving heavy rotation on [[MTV]] and other music television networks.<ref name="band bio" /> Stand-in bassist Scott Koziol is shown performing with the band in two shots of video.<ref name="osc vid">{{Cite web|url=http://www.forfeitthegame.com/video-osc.html|title=One Step Closer video info|accessdate=2007-09-19|publisher=''Forfeit the Game''}}</ref>

The second single was <U+201C>[[Crawling (song)|Crawling]]<U+201D>. Lyrically, the song focuses on Bennington's personal experiences with child abuse &mdash; the physical violence, the difficulty in breaking the cycle of abuse, and the subsequent loss of self-esteem.<ref name="crwling">{{Cite web|url=http://www.songfacts.com/detail.php?id=2648|title=Crawling facts|accessdate=2007-09-29|publisher=''Song Facts''}}</ref> This concept is echoed in the music video, in which a girl named ([[Katelyn Rosaasen]]) is abused by her father and can be seen in the beginning of the video with several visible bruises.<ref name="crwling vid">{{Cite web|url=http://www.forfeitthegame.com/video-crawling.html|title=Crawling video info|accessdate=2007-09-29|publisher=''Forfeit the Game''}}</ref>

<U+201C>[[Papercut (song)|Papercut]]<U+201D> was the album's third single, and its lyrics describe paranoia. The music video for <U+201C>Papercut<U+201D> features the band performing in a hallway opposite a completely dark room on the walls of which are scribbled the song's lyrics. Various supernatural themes are present in the video, and special effects are used to create eerie renditions, such as the <U+201C>stretching<U+201D> of Shinoda's fingers and the <U+201C>melting<U+201D>
of Bourdon's face.<ref name="papercut vid">{{Cite web|url=http://www.forfeitthegame.com/atd-papercut.html|title=Papercut video secrets|accessdate=2007-09-29|publisher=''Forfeit the Game''}}</ref>

The fourth and final single to come from ''Hybrid Theory'' was <U+201C>[[In the End]]," which prominently features a signature piano riff performed by Shinoda. His rapping also dominates the verses of the song and is later joined by Bennington's vocals in the chorus. The music video for <U+201C>In the End<U+201D> was shot at various stops along the [[Ozzfest#Ozzfest 2001|2001 Ozzfest]] tour and was directed by [[Nathan "Karma" Cox]] and the band's [[Disc jockey|DJ]] [[Joe Hahn]], who would go on to direct many of Linkin Park's future videos (the two also directed the music video for "Papercut"). <ref name="phoenix">{{Cite web|url=http://www.roughedge.com/features/linkinpark0901.htm|title=An interview with bassist Phoenix|accessdate=2007-09-29|publisher=''Rough Edge''}}</ref><ref name="ite" /> Although the background for the "In the End" video was filmed in a [[California]] [[desert]], the band itself performed on a studio stage in Los Angeles, with prominent [[Computer generated imagery|CGI]] effects and [[compositing]] being used to create the finished version. Performing on a studio stage allowed Hahn and Cox to set off water pipes above the stage near the end and drench the band.<ref name="ite">{{Cite web|url=http://www.songfacts.com/detail.php?id=1448|title=In the End facts|accessdate=2007-09-29|publisher=''Song Facts''}}</ref>

Although it did not become a single, another song from the album is <U+201C>Points of Authority.<U+201D> Drummer Bourdon describes the recording process of the song: <U+201C>Brad wrote this riff, then went home. Mike decided to cut it up into different pieces and rearranged them on the computer [...] Brad had to learn his own part from the computer.<U+201D> Regarding the song, Delson praised Shinoda's skill, describing him as <U+201C>a genius<U+201D> and <U+201C>[[Trent Reznor]]-talented<U+201D>.<ref name="rolling stone 2002" />

== Reception ==
Initial reception of the album was positive. Stephanie Dickison of ''[[PopMatters]]'', commented that the band was a <U+201C>far more complex and talented group than the hard rock boy bands of late,<U+201D> and claimed that <U+201C>they will continue to fascinate and challenge music's standard sounds.<U+201D><ref name="popmatters">{{Cite web|url=http://www.popmatters.com/music/reviews/l/linkinpark-hybrid.shtml|title=PopMatters review|accessdate=2007-09-29|author=Dickison, Stephanie|publisher=''[[PopMatters]]''}}</ref> ''Sputnikmusic'' described Hybrid Theory as <U+201C>a defining mainstream album at the turn of the century, and for good reason<U+201D> and gave the album three points out of five.<ref name="sputnikmusic" /> [[Robert Christgau]] of ''[[The Village Voice]]'' wrote that <U+201C>the men don't know what the angry boys understand,<U+201D> and gave the album a <U+201C>two-star honorable mention rating,<U+201D> citing <U+201C>Papercut<U+201D> and <U+201C>Points of Authority<U+201D> as highlights of the album.<ref name="christgau">{{Cite web|url=http://www.robertchristgau.com/get_artist.php?name=Linkin+Park|title=Robert Christgau: CG: Linkin Park|accessdate=2007-09-29|publisher=''[[Robert Christgau]]''}}</ref> Jenny Eliscu of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' commented that ''Hybrid Theory'' had <U+201C>as much potency as albums by [[Limp Bizkit]] or [[Korn]]<U+201D> and called it an album that <U+201C>reflects the frustration of life.<U+201D><ref>{{cite news |first= Jenny|last= Eliscu |title=New Faces |publisher=[[Rolling Stone]] |page=29 |date=January 18, 2001 }}</ref>

A number of reviews, however, also panned the album. ''Sputnikmusic'', though praising the album's initial style, also stated that <U+201C>Hybrid Theory has its obvious drawbacks.<U+201D> The publication described Delson's guitar riffs as <U+201C>often bland and unoriginal<U+201D> and claimed that <U+201C>the variety [of the album] lacks incredibly<U+201D>.<ref name="sputnikmusic" /> ''[[All Music Guide]]'' writer William Ruhlmann said that <U+201C>Linkin Park sounds like a Johnny-come-lately to an already overdone musical style<U+201D> and called <U+201C>One Step Closer<U+201D> <U+201C>a typical effort," referring to the lyrics of the song's chorus.<ref name="amg review" />

=== Later recordings ===
Later in 2002, Linkin Park released an album entitled ''[[Reanimation]]''. It included the songs of ''Hybrid Theory'' remixed and reinterpreted by fellow [[nu metal]] artists and several [[underground hip hop]] artists.<ref name="reanimation">{{Cite web|url=http://wc05.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&token=&sql=10:0jfuxqy0ldte|title=Reanimation review|accessdate=2007-09-29|publisher=''All Music Guide''}}</ref> Contributors to the album included [[Jonathan Davis]], [[Aaron Lewis]], and [[Black Thought]]. The sound of later Linkin Park albums would involve experimentation with classical instruments such as [[String section|strings]] and [[piano]], both of which, along with the same elements of [[electronica]] from ''Hybrid Theory'', are prominently included in the band's second studio album, ''[[Meteora (album)|Meteora]]''.<ref name="meteora">{{Cite web|url=http://www.musicomh.com/albums/linkin-park.htm|title=Meteora overview|accessdate=2007-09-29|publisher=''musicOMH.com''}}</ref> As Shinoda explains the difference in the sound between ''Hybrid Theory'' and ''Meteora'': <U+201C>That electronic element has always been there in the band - it's just that sometimes we bring it closer to the front.<U+201D><ref name="musicomh">{{Cite web|url=http://www.musicomh.com/interviews/linkin-park.htm|title=Mike Shinoda interview|accessdate=2007-09-29|publisher=''musicOMH.com''}}</ref>
