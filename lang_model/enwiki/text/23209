{{About|a ship|other meanings|Memnon}}

The '''''Memnon''''' was the first [[clipper|clipper ship]] to arrive in [[San Francisco]] after the [[California Gold Rush|Gold Rush]], and the only clipper to arrive in San Francisco before 1850. Built in 1848, she made record passages to San Francisco and to China, and sailed in the first clipper race around Cape Horn.

==Record passage to San Francisco==
"The only clipper ship to make the voyage to San Francisco prior to 1850 was the ''Memnon'', under Captain George Gordon, which arrived there July 28, 1849 after a record passage of one hundred and twenty days from New York." <ref name = "blane130" >

"Era of the Clipper Ships" lists the captain's name as Joseph R. Gordon, and puts the voyage at 123 days, noting a [[mutiny]] en-route:
<blockquote>
"Gordon had it in his mind to set the record with this voyage around the Horn and was driving his new crew hard, and soon had a mutiny with "all hands refusing duty." [[Belaying pin]]s and hand spikes were soon flying, and the Memnon was forced to put into [[Montevideo]], where Gordon discharged the troublemakers. He took on a new crew before proceeding on the Memnon's  record breaking voyage of 123 sailing days from [[Sandy Hook]], arriving in San Francisco Bay on August 28, 1849." <ref name = "era1">

In his ''Notes on Ships of the Past'', [[Robert Bennet Forbes|Captain R.B. Forbes]] describes the following voyages in the ''Memnon'':
<blockquote>
"She crossed from San Francisco to [[Hong Kong]] in 1850 in 36 days, in charge of Captain Gordon. Captain [[Louis M. Goldsborough|L. M. Goldsborough]] was passenger in her, and spoke very highly of her performances.<ref name = "forbes" />

This China passage was a record, according to Cutler; however, the [[New York Herald]] of Jan. 24, 1853 stated that it ended in Whampoa rather than Hong Kong.<ref name = "cutler6" >

"The first contest of clippers around [[Cape Horn]] took place in 1850, between the ''[[Houqua (clipper)|Hoqua]],'' the ''[[Sea Witch (clipper)|Sea Witch]]'', ''Samuel Russell'', and ''Memnon'', old rivals on [[Old China Trade|China voyages]], and the new clippers ''Celestial'', ''Mandarin'', and ''Race Horse'' ... Large sums of money were wagered on the result, the four older vessels having established high reputations for speed. The ''Samuel Russell'' was commanded by Charles Low, previously of the ''Hoqua'', while the ''Hoqua'' was now commanded by Captain McKenzie; Captain Gordon was again in the ''Memnon'', and Captain George Fraser, who had sailed with [[Robert Waterman (sea captain)|Captain Waterman]] as chief mate.<U+201D>

The ''Samuel Russell'' knocked eleven days off the record, arriving in San Francisco after 109 days from New York. ''Hoqua'' arrived next, in 120 days from New York, and the following day ''Sea Witch'' arrived after a 97 day passage, knocking an additional 12 days off the record. The performance of ''Sea Witch'' was particularly astonishing because she had rounded Cape Horn during the Antarctic midwinter.

"The remaining ships arrived in the following order: ''Memnon'', 123 days, ''Celestial'', 104 days, ''Race Horse'', 109 days from Boston, and ''Mandarin'', 126 days from New York-- all 'exceptionally fine passages,' average passages of the time being 159 days." <ref name = "Clark5">

==1852 Challenge to British Clippers for a Race Around the Horn==
<blockquote>
"On January 3, 1852, the ''[[The Illustrated London News|Illustrated London News]]'' ... published a portrait of the ''Chrysolite'' accompanying an article in which it was stated that both the ''Chrysolite'' and the ''Stornoway'' had beaten the ''[[Surprise (clipper)|Surprise]]'', and that the ''Chrysolite'' had completely beaten the ''Memnon'' during a race in the [[Gaspar Strait]]s. The article caused a good deal of interest in the United States, and it caused the formation by a number of high-spirited young merchants and ship-owners at [[Boston]] of a society called the "American Navigation Club", which consisted of Daniel C.

In his ''Journal of Voyages to China and their Return 1851-1853'',  Henry Blane described the circumstances of ''Memnon'''s loss:
<blockquote> <U+201C>At sunrise the faint outlines of Gaspar Island could be seen and as we were running with a free wind 6 knots, by daylight were within 15 miles of it on our starboard bow. This is the Island where Capt. Gordon landed from the ''Memnon'' on Pulo Leat.

At 10 A.M. was abreast of Pulo Leat and could distinctly see the spot where Capt. Gordon ran ''Memnon'' ashore four months since. He was beating down through the Straits and was warned by his mate Mr. Fisher that he was standing too near in shore, and Capt. G.'s reply was, " he knew his business " <U+2014> ten minutes after she struck. Capt. G. found it was impossible to get her off, and he with his wife and crew took to the boats <U+2014> (the Malay pirates swarming up one side while they were going over the other) <U+2014> and started for Gaspar Island which lay 25 miles north. The next day Mr. Fisher (mate) with one of the boats and a pair of sails with part of the crew started for Singapore bearing N.W. distance 300 miles. The first days run was 156 miles and two days after arrived at Singapore where he reported the loss of the ''Memnon.'' A vessel was sent for Capt. Gordon but he had put off 8 days after Mr. Fisher in the other boat for a ship which was coming down through the straits bound for Singapore where he and his wife and crew arrived without any further accident. By the following mail Capt. G and wife started overland to Boston where they belonged. This  [http://www.swaen.com/antique-map-image-of.php?id=482 Island Pulo Leat] has been the cause of a great many shipwrecks. It stands directly in the Centre of the passage through which a 5 knot current is constantly running, changing its direction once in six months with the Monsoon. The passage is about two miles wide and bounded on the opposite side by shoals.<ref name = "blane78" >
