{{Music of Final Fantasy}}
{{hatnote|"XIV" refers to the original version of the game, while "A Realm Reborn" refers to its reboot.}}
The music for the [[Massively multiplayer online role-playing game|MMORPG]] ''[[Final Fantasy XIV]]'' was composed by [[Nobuo Uematsu]], a regular contributor to the music of the ''[[Final Fantasy]]'' series. Several other composers including [[Masayoshi Soken]] and [[Naoshi Mizuta]] contributed music for updates to the game. The music for the game's reboot, ''[[Final Fantasy XIV: A Realm Reborn]]'', was primarily composed by Soken, who was the sound director for both releases of the game. Music from both releases of the game has been released in several albums, though no album contains music from both ''XIV'' and ''A Realm Reborn''. A pair of [[mini-album]]s containing a handful of selected tracks from ''XIV'', ''Final Fantasy XIV: Battle Tracks'' and ''Final Fantasy XIV: Field Tracks'', were released by [[Square Enix]] in 2010 when ''XIV'' first launched. A soundtrack album titled ''Final Fantasy XIV - Eorzean Frontiers'', containing most of the music that had been released by that point for ''XIV'', was digitally released in 2012. A final soundtrack album for the original release of the game, ''Before Meteor: Final Fantasy XIV Original Soundtrack'', was released in 2013 just before the launch of ''A Realm Reborn'', and contains all of the music that was composed for ''XIV'' throughout its lifetime. The latest soundtrack album, ''Final Fantasy XIV: A Realm Reborn Original Soundtrack'', was released in 2014, and contains all of the music for ''A Realm Reborn'' released up to that point.

The soundtracks for both releases of the game were well received by critics. Uematsu's mix of orchestral and rock tracks for ''XIV'' were praised, though the delayed release of a full album drew criticism. Soken's work on ''A Realm Reborn'', including both his original tracks as well as themes carried over from ''XIV'' and previous ''[[Final Fantasy]]'' games, were heavily praised by reviewers for the game. Music from the initial release of the game has been played in the international ''Distant Worlds'' [[Final Fantasy concerts|''Final Fantasy'' concert]] series, and books of sheet music for piano arrangements of music from the game have been produced.

==Creation and influence==
[[File:Nobuo Uematsu.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Composer [[Nobuo Uematsu]] in 2006]]
The [[massively multiplayer online role-playing game]] (MMORPG) ''[[Final Fantasy XIV]]'' was released in two versions: the original (live between 2010 and 2012), and its remake (''[[Final Fantasy XIV: A Realm Reborn]]'', live since 2013). The music for ''XIV'' was composed by [[Nobuo Uematsu]], who was the lead composer for the first ten main ''[[Final Fantasy]]'' games and a contributor to the ''[[Final Fantasy XI]]'' and ''[[Final Fantasy XII|XII]]'' soundtracks.<ref name="FF14"/> Over the two years that ''XIV'' was active, several updates were made to the game, which included additional music composed by [[Masayoshi Soken]], [[Naoshi Mizuta]], [[Tsuyoshi Sekito]] and [[Ryo Yamazaki]].<ref name= "XIVeorzea"/> ''XIV'' was poorly received, and despite the updates, Square Enix decided to take the game offline for a time, and relaunch it with a new development team under a new name.<ref name="relaunch"/> Soken, the sound director for both releases, composed the soundtrack to ''A Realm Reborn''.<ref name="FF142"/>

Prior to agreeing to create ''XIV''{{'}}s score, Uematsu had already planned to compose "[[Kimi ga Iru Kara (Sayuri Sugawara song)|Kimi ga Iru Kara]]", the theme song for ''[[Final Fantasy XIII]]''. Wanting him to fully focus on ''XIV'', Square Enix asked ''XIII''{{'}}s main composer [[Masashi Hamauzu]] to write the song instead. Thus, ''XIII'' was the first main-series ''Final Fantasy'' game soundtrack to not include Uematsu's work.<ref name= "UematsuXIII"/> Despite ''XIV'' being an MMO and thus a new genre for him, Uematsu treated it as any other video game project. Compared to his previous work within the series, Uematsu had considerable creative freedom while composing the soundtrack, because the rest of the production team did not fully envision beforehand how the soundtrack would sound or fit into the game. Uematsu created a mixture of orchestral and [[Rock music|rock]] pieces for the game's battle themes. There was a momentary crisis when he lost most of the data for his completed tracks and needed to hire a data recovery service.<ref name= "1UPuematsu"/> He worked as a freelance composer during the project for Square Enix, also composing the music for ''[[The Last Story]]'', a game from ''Final Fantasy'' creator [[Hironobu Sakaguchi]].<ref name= "VGMuematsu"/> The game's theme song, "Answers", was sung by Susan Calloway. She was chosen by Uematsu, who had worked with her during the first ''Distant Worlds'' concert and was impressed by her singing abilities.<ref name= "SuCalloWeb"/>

For ''A Realm Reborn'', Soken was the primary composer, in addition to reprising his ''XIV'' role as lead sound director. The primary goal given to the music team was to make the music true to the series. Naoki Yoshida, the game's producer and director, told Soken to "give [the team] something straightforward that anyone could identify as ''Final Fantasy'', with an easy-to-understand, expressive orchestral sound".<ref name= "XIV_ARRnotes"/> Soken focused primarily on creating the soundtrack rather than his sound director role. He often created new tracks due to requests from staff members. As the game was developed and released in a shorter timeframe than the original release, Soken and the sound team were given less than a year to create both the music and the various sound effects for the game world. According to Soken, it felt like "enough work for two full games in that time".<ref name= "XIV_ARRnotes"/> Unlike the freedom given Uematsu for ''XIV'', most of the tracks for ''A Realm Reborn'' had specific guidelines, though Soken was allowed to "do what [he liked]" for Titan's battle theme.<ref name= "RPGsoken"/> Soken sang the vocal work for some tracks, such as the battle theme for Leviathan.<ref name= "SokenLeviathan"/> Several themes and tracks from the original game were carried over both directly and as a part of new tracks in ''A Realm Reborn'', including the original vocal theme.<ref name= "RPGxiv"/> Soken also remixed tunes from earlier ''Final Fantasy'' games for use in special in-game events.<ref name= "RPGsoken"/>

The [[mini-album]]s ''Final Fantasy XIV: Battle Tracks'' and ''Final Fantasy XIV: Field Tracks'' were the first releases of music from the game, and were published by Square Enix on September 29, 2010, a week after the game itself was released. They feature selected tracks from ''XIV''. The music was composed by Uematsu and arranged by Tsutomu Narita. Kenichiro Fukui also helped arrange some of the pieces on the ''Field Tracks'' mini-album. ''Battle Tracks'' has nine pieces, and includes the game's opening theme, the boss theme "Nail of the Heavens", and ''Final Fantasy XIV''{{'}}s rendition of Uematsu's "Victory Fanfare".<ref name= "XIVbattle"/> ''Field Tracks'' predominantly features the main themes for the game's countries Ul'dah, Gridania and Limsa Lominsa, along with other pieces of music heard during traveling, for a total of eight tracks.<ref name="XIVfield"/> Each mini-album was accompanied by special liner notes by Uematsu describing his experiences writing music for the series, with particular reference to the [[Final Fantasy (video game)|first game]].<ref name="XIVnotes1"/><ref name="XIVnotes2"/>

Patrick Gann of ''RPGFan'' termed the mini-albums as a good return work from Uematsu despite some of the unexpected battle tracks, though he questioned whether the discs themselves would be worth purchasing once a full soundtrack album was released.<ref name="XIVbattle"/><ref name="XIVfield"/> Jayson Napolitano of ''Original Sound Version'' was generally positive, and cited the composition of the battle themes as "a cross between [[The Black Mages]] and Uematsu's work on ''[[Lord of Vermilion]]''".<ref name= "OSVreview"/> The more orchestral field tracks were also praised.<ref name= "OSVreview"/> Chris Greening of ''Square Enix Music Online'' termed ''Field Tracks'' as "largely likeable", and appreciated Uematsu's use of rock music in ''Battle Tracks'', though he disliked the strategy of releasing two incomplete mini-albums rather than a full soundtrack album.<ref name="SEMOfield"/><ref name="SEMObattle"/> Both mini-albums sold well: ''Battle Tracks'' appeared at position #73 on the Japanese [[Oricon]] album charts for a week, while ''Field Tracks'' appeared at position #75 for that same week.<ref name="ORIbattle"/><ref name="ORIfield"/>

''Final Fantasy XIV - Eorzean Frontiers'' was the first full album of music from the game to be released. It was published by Square Enix on September 1, 2012 as a digital album through [[iTunes]]. The tracks include most of the music that had been released for the game at that point, including pieces that were present at the game's launch and some which were added later, including "Rise of the White Raven", the theme for Nael Van Darnus, and the themes for the Grand Companies of Eorzea. All of the tracks from the album were additionally released on the same date in a set of smaller digital mini-albums, also released through iTunes, titled ''Final Fantasy XIV Frontiers - Gridania'', ''Ishgard'', ''Limsa Lominsa'', and ''Ul'dah''. The majority of the music was composed by Nobuo Uematsu, with additional pieces contributed by Masayoshi Soken, Naoshi Mizuta, Tsuyoshi Sekito, and Ryo Yamazaki. The 38 tracks of the album cover a duration of 3:14:24.<ref name= "XIVeorzea"/>

Derek Heemsbergen of ''RPGFan'' reviewed the album as an "incredibly rich and diverse musical score", and felt that regardless of the reception to the game itself, that the soundtrack was worthy of a ''Final Fantasy'' game.<ref name= "XIVeorzea"/> Jayson Napolitano of ''[[Destructoid]]'', in his review of the album, found that while there were many interesting tracks in the album and that the total length of more than three hours made the album a "good deal", that most of the tracks that he enjoyed the most were previously featured on the ''Final Fantasy XIV Battle Tracks'' and ''Field Tracks'' mini-albums.<ref name="DESeorzea"/>

On August 14, 2013, two weeks before the release of ''A Realm Reborn'', Square Enix published ''Before Meteor: Final Fantasy XIV Original Soundtrack'', a full soundtrack album with all of the music composed for the original release of the game, which had shut down a year prior. The 104-track album was released on a single [[Blu-ray Disc|Blu-ray disc]] and included music lasting 6:05:51, with both the original music by Uematsu as well as the additional tracks composed by Mizuta, Yamazaki, Sekito, Soken, and Ai Yamashita during the game's run. The disc also included a remastered version of the "A New Beginning" trailer and a bonus download code for an in-game Daulmund Minion.<ref name= "XIVdetails"/> The Blu-ray disc allowed purchasers to rip digital copies of the album on their Blu-ray devices to play without the disc.<ref name= "USxiv"/> None of the ''Eorzean Frontiers'' reviewers from album a year prior returned to review the final ''XIV'' album.
