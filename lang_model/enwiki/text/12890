'''Lawrence "Larry" Page'''<ref>http://infolab.stanford.edu/~page/</ref> (born March 26, 1973) is an American [[computer scientist]] best known as co-founder of [[Google]] Inc.

==Early life and education==
Page was born into a Jewish family in [[East Lansing, Michigan]].<ref>As reported in his own bio in his famous article on the Google invention, "Lawrence Page was born in East Lansing, Michigan. . . ." See [http://infolab.stanford.edu/~backrub/google.html Sergey Brin and Lawrence Page, "Anatomy of a Search Engine"] (retrieved January 25, 2010).</ref>  His parents were computer science professors at [[Michigan State University]].<ref>http://www.cse.msu.edu/endowment/carl_page.php</ref> During an interview, Page said that "their house was usually a mess, with computers and ''Popular Science'' magazines all over the place." His attraction to computers started when he was six years old when he got to "play with the stuff lying around."  He became the "first kid in his elementary school to turn in an assignment from a word processor."<ref name=Scott>Scott, Virginia. ''Google: Corporations That Changed the World'', Greenwood Publishing Group (2008)</ref> His older brother also taught him to take things apart, and before long he was taking "everything in his house apart to see how it worked."  He said,"From a very early age, I also realized I wanted to invent things. So I became really interested in technology...and business. So probably from when I was 12 I knew I was going to start a company eventually."<ref name=Scott/>

Page attended the Okemos [[Montessori]] School (now called Montessori Radmoor) in [[Okemos, Michigan]] from 1975 to 1979, and graduated from [[East Lansing High School]] (1991).{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}} He holds a [[Bachelor of Science]] [[academic degree|degree]] in [[computer engineering]] from the [[University of Michigan]] with honors and a [[Masters degree]] in [[Computer Science]] from [[Stanford University]]. While at the University of Michigan, "Page created an [[inkjet printer]] made of [[Lego]] bricks" (actually a line plotter),<ref name="corpexecs"/> served as the president of the [[HKN]],<ref>{{cite web | title = HKN College Chapter Directory | publisher = Eta Kappa Nu | date = 2007-01-15 | url = http://www.hkn.org/admin/chapters/beta_epsilon.html }}</ref> and was a member of the [[1993 "Maize & Blue" University of Michigan Solar Car Team|solar car team]].

==Academic research==
After enrolling for a [[Ph.D]]. program in computer science at [[Stanford University]], Larry Page was in search of a dissertation theme and considered exploring the mathematical properties of the [[World Wide Web]], understanding its link structure as a huge [[Graph (mathematics)|graph]].<ref name="wiredbirth">[[John Battelle|Battelle, John]]. "[http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/13.08/battelle.html?tw=wn_tophead_4 The Birth of Google]." ''[[Wired Magazine]].'' August 2005.</ref>  His supervisor [[Terry Winograd]] encouraged him to pursue this idea, which Page later recalled as "the best advice I ever got".<ref>[http://money.cnn.com/galleries/2008/fortune/0804/gallery.bestadvice.fortune/2.html The best advice I ever got] (Fortune, April 2008)</ref> Page then focused on the problem of finding out which web pages link to a given page, considering the number and nature of such [[backlink]]s to be valuable [[information]] about that page (with the role of [[citation]]s in [[academic publishing]] in mind).<ref name="wiredbirth"/> In his research project, nicknamed "BackRub", he was soon joined by [[Sergey Brin]], a fellow Stanford Ph.D. student.<ref name="wiredbirth"/>

[[John Battelle]], co-founder of [[Wired magazine]], wrote of Page that he had reasoned that the "entire Web was loosely based on the premise of citation <U+2013> after all, what is a link but a citation? If he could devise a method to count and qualify each backlink on the Web, as Page puts it 'the Web would become a more valuable place'."<ref name="wiredbirth"/> Battelle further described how Page and Brin began working  together on the project:

:"At the time Page conceived of BackRub, the Web comprised an estimated 10 million documents, with an untold number of links between them. The computing resources required to crawl such a beast were well beyond the usual bounds of a student project. Unaware of exactly what he was getting into, Page began building out his crawler.

:"The idea's complexity and scale lured Brin to the job. A polymath who had jumped from project to project without settling on a thesis topic, he found the premise behind BackRub fascinating. "I talked to lots of research groups" around the school, Brin recalls, "and this was the most exciting project, both because it tackled the Web, which represents human knowledge, and because I liked Larry."<ref name=wiredbirth/>

Brin and Page originally met in March, 1995, during a spring orientation of new computer science Ph.D. candidates. Brin, who had already been in the program for two years, was assigned to show some students, including Page, around campus, and they later became good friends.<ref name=Moschovitis>Moschovitis Group. ''The Internet: A Historical Encyclopedia'', ABC-CLIO (2005)</ref> 

To convert the backlink data gathered by BackRub's [[web crawler]] into a measure of importance for a given web page, Brin and Page developed the [[PageRank]] algorithm, and realized that it could be used to build a [[Search engine (computing)|search engine]] far superior to existing ones.<ref name="wiredbirth"/>  It relied on a new kind of technology which analyzed the relevance of the back links that connected one Web page to another.<ref name=Moschovitis/> In August 1996, the initial version of Google was made available, still on the Stanford University Web site.<ref name="wiredbirth"/>

==Business==
{{Main|Google|History of Google}}
In 1998, Brin and Page founded Google, Inc.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.google.com/corporate/execs.html#larry| title = Larry Page Profile | publisher = Google }}</ref>  Page ran Google as co-president along with Brin until 2001 when they hired [[Eric E. Schmidt|Eric Schmidt]] as Chairman and CEO of Google. Both Page and [[Sergey Brin|Brin]] earn an annual compensation of [[one-dollar salary|one dollar]].

==Personal life==
Page married [[Lucinda Southworth]] at [[Richard Branson]]'s Caribbean island, [[Necker Island (British Virgin Islands)|Necker Island]], on December 8, 2007.<ref>[http://www.reuters.com/article/mediaNews/idUSN1360879220071114 Google founder Larry Page to marry], Reuters.</ref><ref>[http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5hsrCJztj9j0xezqYCWBi8Dg2ifbQD8ST2SL82 Google Co-Founder Page to Wed], The Associated Press.</ref> Brin and Page are the executive producers of the film, [[Broken Arrows]]. In 2004, he and [[Sergey Brin]] were named "Persons of the Week" by [[ABC World News Tonight]].
