Independents: [[Rory McEwen]], [[Bob Such]], [[Kris Hanna]]

In the 22-member [[South Australian Legislative Council|Legislative Council]] (upper house), both major parties finished with a total of eight seats each, with Labor winning four and the Liberals winning three. [[No Pokies]] independent [[Nick Xenophon]] polled 20.5 percent, an unprecedented result for an independent or minor party which resulted in both Xenophon and his running mate, [[Ann Bressington]] being elected. Xenophon's third running mate, [[John Darley (Australian politician)|John Darley]], was appointed to the vacancy created by Xenophon's later resignation.

==Party backgrounds==
===Australian Labor Party===
The [[Australian Labor Party]] is Australia's oldest political party, founded in 1891. It is a [[centre-left]] [[social democratic]] party which is formally linked to the [[trade union]] [[Australian labour movement|labour movement]]. On a [[states and territories of Australia|state]] level, Labor has been in government since 2002, after having been in opposition from 1993 to 2002. Since the [[South Australian state election, 1970|1970 election]] ending decades of electoral [[malapportionment]] of the [[Playmander]], nine of 12 elections have been won by Labor. Labor's premiers in South Australia include [[Thomas Price]] in the 1900s, to the reformist [[Don Dunstan]] in the 1970s to the factionally nonaligned and pragmatic current premier, [[Mike Rann]].<ref>[http://www.ministers.sa.gov.au/news.php?id=504 Rann nominated for National ALP President], Government of South Australia, 16 August 2006.  Retrieved on 4 January 2007.</ref> The party's deputy leader, and therefore the Deputy Premier, is [[Kevin Foley]].

===Liberal Party of Australia===
The [[Liberal Party of Australia]] is a [[centre-right]] [[Conservative liberalism|conservative liberal]] party (see [[Liberalism in Australia]]), with close links to business and advocating [[free markets]]. Whilst primarily a [[Social conservatism|social conservative]] party, there exists a more [[Social liberalism|social liberal]] wing, colloquially known as 'wet', 'moderate' or [[small-l liberal]]s, highlighted by the short-lived [[Liberal Movement]] who first contested the [[South Australian state election, 1975|1975 election]] as a separate party led by [[Steele Hall]]. At [[states and territories of Australia|state]] level, the [[Liberal Party of Australia]] in 1973 descended from the [[Liberal and Country League]] (LCL), which resulted from a merger between the [[Liberal Federation]] and the then-Country Party in 1932. The state opposition leader at the 2006 election, [[Rob Kerin]], was factionally nonaligned.<ref>Parker, Lachlan. [http://www.abc.net.au/pm/stories/s397389.htm New Liberal Premier for SA], ABC PM Transcript, 22 October 2001. Retrieved on 4 January 2007.</ref>

===Nationals SA===
The [[Nationals SA]] are a sub-division of the [[conservatism|conservative]] [[National Party of Australia]] (formerly the Country Party). First contesting the [[South Australian state election, 1965|1965 election]], they have only held two seats at alternating periods; [[Electoral district of Flinders|Flinders]] (1973<U+2013>1993) and [[Electoral district of Chaffey|Chaffey]] (1997<U+2013>current).<ref>[http://www.abc.net.au/elections/sa/2006/guide/pastelec.htm Past Elections (House of Assembly)], ''ABC Elections SA'', 2006.

Retrieved on 3 February 2007.</ref> As the Liberal Party in South Australia is descended from a historical merger from an earlier Country Party, the SA Nationals are not as dominant in rural areas as their eastern state counterparts.

===SA Greens===
The [[SA Greens]], founded in 1995 are a sub-division of the left-wing [[Australian Greens]]. They are based on [[green politics]] and consider themselves a [[new politics]] party with strong beliefs in [[ecology]], [[democracy]] and [[social justice]] amongst other issues.<ref>[http://www.sa.greens.org.au/charter.htm The Greens Charter], sa.greens.org.au, Retrieved on 4 January 2007.</ref> Federally and locally they have seen a continued rise in primary votes, in part due to the demise of the [[Australian Democrats]].<ref>[http://arts.anu.edu.au/democraticaudit/papers/20060411_and_mann_elec_sa.pdf Implications for democracy in the Festival State(PDF)], Australian National University, April, 2006, page 5. Retrieved on 4 January 2007.</ref> The [[Australian federal election, 2007|2007 federal election]] saw 77.28% of preferences flow to Labor over the Liberal Party in SA. The party's leader is [[Mark Parnell]].

===Family First Party===
The [[Family First Party]], founded immediately before the [[South Australian state election, 2002|2002 state election]], has a political ideology based on [[Christian]]-influenced [[conservatism]]. Although officially a secular party, it has close links to the [[Pentecostal]] movement,<ref>[http://www.abc.net.au/elections/federal/2004/weblog/200409/s1203451.htm Who is Family First?], ''ABC - Matt Liddy's Poll Vault'', 21 September 2004.

Retrieved on 4 January 2007.</ref> and its social policies generally mirror [[Conservative Christianity|conservative Christian values]] (but not necessarily [[Political conservatism|politically conservative values]]). The [[Australian federal election, 2007|2007 federal election]] saw 57.10% of preferences flow to the Liberals over the Labor Party in SA. The party's leader at the time of the election was [[Andrew Evans (pastor)|Andrew Evans]].

===Australian Democrats===
The [[Australian Democrats]] were originally a centrist party, with most current policies based on [[social liberalism]]. Federally, the party was founded in 1977 from three different groups, all of which had split from the Liberal Party at different times: the [[Liberal Movement]], which had split from its parent over electoral reform; the [[Australia Party]], which had rebelled against Australia's involvement in the [[Vietnam War]], and initial leader [[Don Chipp]], who left the [[Liberal Party of Australia]], dissatisfied with the increasing underrepresentation of small-l liberals. At the state level it is descended from the [[New LM|New Liberal Movement (New LM)]] of [[Robin Millhouse]], who held the Democrats' only lower house seats, [[Electoral district of Waite|Mitcham]] and its successor seat [[Electoral district of Waite|Waite]].<ref>[http://www.pollbludger.com/sa2006/waite.htm South Australian House of Assembly Election 2006:  Waite], PollBludger.com, 2006.  Retrieved on 4 January 2007.</ref> The Democrats have suffered internal problems and leadership scuffles since 1997. The [[Australian federal election, 2007|2007 federal election]] saw 65.79% of preferences flow to Labor over the Liberal Party in SA. The party's leader is [[Sandra Kanck]].

South Australia is governed according to the principles of the [[Westminster system]], a form of parliamentary government based on the model of the United Kingdom. Legislative power rests with the [[Parliament of South Australia]], which consists of [[Queen of Australia|The Sovereign]] (represented by the [[Governor of South Australia]]), the [[South Australian House of Assembly|House of Assembly]] (lower house) which forms government, and the [[South Australian Legislative Council|Legislative Council]] (upper house)  as a house of review. Forty-seven members of the lower house represent [[South Australian House of Assembly electoral districts|single-member electorates]] and are elected under the [[preferential voting|preferential]] [[Instant-runoff voting]] (IRV) system for fixed four-year terms.<ref>[http://www.aph.gov.au/library/pubs/rn/2005-06/06rn04.htm Timetable for the next Australian elections], Parliament of Australia Parliamentary Library, 30 August 2005.  Retrieved on 4 January 2007.</ref> The independent [[State Electoral Office]], which conducts elections, is responsible for a mandatory [[redistricting]] of boundaries before each election to ensure [[one vote one value]]. At each election, voters choose half of the 22 upper house members, each of whom serve eight-year terms in a single statewide electorate. 

The Legislative Council is elected under the [[preferential voting|preferential]] [[Single Transferable Vote]] (STV) system through a means of [[Group voting ticket]]s. Voters can choose to vote for a ticket by placing the number '1' in one of the ticket boxes "above the line" or can vote for individual candidates by numbering all the boxes "below the line" (54 in the 2006 election). In above the line voting, ticket votes are distributed according to the party or group voting ticket registered before the election with the [[election management body]]. As most ballot papers are above the line, this form of voting often leads to pre-election trading between parties on how each party will allocate later preferences to other parties and candidates.

Voting is compulsory once enrolled in South Australian elections,<ref name=QA/>  which results in turnout rates above 90 percent. Informal voting, which occurs when a voting slip is not valid, is at a rate of under five percent. Voting slips are informal when they are not filled out correctly, such examples are not numbering subsequent numbers, not filling out all the candidate boxes with numbers (except the last candidate), or in some other way that is verified by the State Electoral Office as illegible. South Australian elections have some features that are unique to the rest of Australia.<ref>[http://www.abc.net.au/elections/sa/2006/guide/ticketprefs.htm Unique Features of South Australian Elections], ''ABC News Online'', 14 February 2006.

As elections have fixed four-year terms, the election date of 18 March 2006 was known well ahead of time. The Electoral Act stipulates that the election is to be held on the third Saturday in March every four years. The election campaign must run for a minimum of 25 days or a maximum of 55 days, therefore the Governor would have needed to issue writs for the election by 21 February 2006 at the latest.<ref>[http://www.seo.sa.gov.au/apps/news/?sectionID=9&pageID=71 Election Process: Election Timetable], State Electoral Office, South Australia, 3 July 2003.

Another facet of the Labor campaign was extensive [[negative campaigning]] against Liberal leader Rob Kerin, including an advertisement featuring an excerpt of an interview that Kerin had with [[FIVEaa]] presenter [[Keith Conlon]] where Conlon asked Kerin why he wanted to be leader of the Liberal Party. Kerin stammered for a few seconds and gave the impression that he was uncertain. The advertisement concluded with the question, "Does Rob Want The Job?".

The final results for the House of Assembly seats were 28 Labor, 15 Liberal, three independents and one National. First preference and two party preferred statistics for each district are available through the [[South Australian House of Assembly electoral districts]] article.

Labor won six of eight key seats, the Liberals one of three key seats.<ref name="Key">Green, Antony. [http://www.abc.net.au/elections/sa/2006/guide/keysbyparty.htm "Key Seats by Party and Margin"], ''ABC elections SA''.  Retrieved on 4 January 2007.</ref> Labor's wins included the previously marginal Liberal seats of [[Electoral district of Hartley|Hartley]], [[Electoral district of Light|Light]], [[Electoral district of Morialta|Morialta]], [[Electoral district of Mawson|Mawson]], [[Electoral district of Bright|Bright]] and [[Electoral district of Newland|Newland]]. The Liberals regained Peter Lewis' seat of [[Electoral district of Hammond|Hammond]]. 

National [[Karlene Maywald]] and Independents [[Bob Such]], [[Rory McEwen]] and [[Kris Hanna]] were all re-elected. Hanna was elected at the [[South Australian state election, 2002|2002 election]] as a Labor candidate; this counted as a loss for Labor, giving Labor a net gain of five seats.

Labor, the Liberals and the Greens ran in all 47 seats, the Democrats ran in all but [[Electoral district of Giles|Giles]] which resulted in a contested seat vote of three percent, Family First ran in all but [[Electoral district of Ramsay|Ramsay]] and [[Electoral district of Croydon (South Australia)|Croydon]] with a contested seat vote of 6.1 percent, with the Nationals running in [[Electoral district of Chaffey|Chaffey]], [[Electoral district of Flinders|Flinders]], [[Electoral district of Finniss|Finniss]], and [[Electoral district of MacKillop|MacKillop]], with a subsequent contested seat vote of 24.8 percent. Dignity for Disabled ran in ten seats, No Rodeo in seven seats, and One Nation in six seats.<ref>[http://www.upperhouse.info/SA/SA2006.aspx South Australia 2006 Election Results], Upperhouse.info, Retrieved on 14 January 2007.</ref>

====Key Liberal seats====
The outer southern suburbs district of [[electoral district of Mawson|Mawson]] was first won by former Liberal Police Minister [[Robert Brokenshire]] in the [[South Australian state election, 1993|1993 state election]]. He was defeated by Labor candidate and former radio presenter [[Leon Bignell]] who received a 5.7 percent two party preferred swing.<ref> Green, Antony. [http://www.abc.net.au/elections/sa/2006/guide/maws.htm South Australian Election 2006: Mawson Electorate Profile], ''ABC News Online'', 20 April 2006.  Retrieved on 15 April 2008.</ref>

The other outer suburbs district that fell to Labor was [[electoral district of Bright|Bright]], which was held since 1989 by former Liberal energy minister [[Wayne Matthew]]. Matthew decided to retire at this election; subsequently the seat was contested for the Liberals by Legislative Council member [[Angus Redford]]. Redford faced a tougher fight than expected<ref>[http://www.pollbludger.com/sa2006/bright.htm South Australian House of Assembly Election 2006:  Bright], PollBludger.com.  Retrieved on 4 January 2007.</ref> and was defeated by Labor candidate [[Chloe Fox]] who received a huge 14.4 percent swing on a two party preferred basis, the largest in the state.<ref name="bright"/>

The inner southern suburbs district of [[electoral district of Unley|Unley]] was won in 2002 by outspoken Liberal [[Mark Brindal]] who failed to win Liberal preselection for the seat in the lead up to the 2006 election and attempted to gain backing to contest the marginal Labor seat of Adelaide, but was shrouded in a controversy concerning a sexual relationship that Brindal had with a mentally ill man.<ref>Curtis, Christopher.

Retrieved on 4 January 2007.</ref> The Liberal candidate was businessman [[David Pisoni]], while the Labor candidate was Unley Mayor [[Michael Keenan (South Australian politician)|Michael Keenan]], who received a 7.9 percent two party preferred swing, narrowly missing out on picking up the seat by 1.1 percent.<ref> Green, Antony.

The inner north eastern suburbs district of [[electoral district of Hartley|Hartley]] had been won by [[Joe Scalzi]] in 1993 and held by a very narrow margin in each election since. The district has a very high proportion of [[Italian people|Italian migrants]] and the ability to speak [[Italian language|Italian]] is considered by many commentators as vital to win the seat<ref>Green, Antony.[http://www.abc.net.au/elections/sa/2006/guide/hart.htm South Australian Election 2006: District of Hartley], ''ABC News online'', 20 April 2006.  Retrieved on 4 January 2007.</ref> and was a factor in Labor's preselection of political staffer [[Grace Portolesi]]. Portolesi defeated Scalzi with a 5.9 percent two party preferred swing.<ref> Green, Antony.

The neighbouring district of [[Electoral district of Morialta|Morialta]] was held before this election by former Liberal Tourism Minister [[Joan Hall]] since 1993. She was defeated by Labor candidate [[Lindsay Simmons]]. Simmons received a 12 percent two party preferred swing, with Labor winning the seat for the first time since 1975.<ref> Green, Antony.

In the outer north-east, the district of [[Electoral district of Newland|Newland]] had been won by Liberal [[Dorothy Kotz]] since 1989, but after her decision to retire, the Liberal Party preselected police officer and local councillor Mark Osterstock. He was defeated by Labor candidate [[Tom Kenyon]], who won the seat with a 12.5 percent two party preferred swing.<ref> Green, Antony. [http://www.abc.net.au/elections/sa/2006/guide/newl.htm South Australian Election 2006: Newland Electorate Profile], ''ABC News Online'', 20 April 2006.  Retrieved on 15 April 2008.</ref>

In [[Electoral district of Light|Light]], which contains [[Gawler, South Australia|Gawler]] and the outer northern suburbs, was recontested by sitting Liberal member and former Education Minister [[Malcolm Buckby]]. He was defeated by Labor candidate and Gawler Mayor [[Tony Piccolo]], who received a 4.9 percent two party preferred swing. This seat fell to Labor for the first time since 1944.<ref> Green, Antony. [http://www.abc.net.au/elections/sa/2006/guide/ligh.htm South Australian Election 2006: Light Electorate Profile], ''ABC News Online'', 20 April 2006.  Retrieved on 15 April 2008.</ref>

The rural and outback district of [[electoral district of Stuart|Stuart]] was first won in 1997 by Liberal [[Graham Gunn]], a former Speaker and Australia's longest currently serving parliamentarian<ref>[http://www.abc.net.au/elections/sa/2006/news/stories/1598468.htm?elections/sa/2006/ "Stuart count goes down to the wire"], ''ABC elections SA'', 22 March 2006.  Retrieved on 4 January 2007.</ref> (the longest being [[Billy Hughes]] at 51 years). As in 2002, he was challenged by Labor ministerial adviser Justin Jarvis. Unlike the Adelaide metropolitan area and the neighbouring seat of [[electoral district of Giles|Giles]], there was only a small swing of 0.7 percent to Labor, subsequently Gunn managed to hang on with a margin of 0.6 percent.<ref> Green, Antony.

====Key Labor seats====

The inner eastern suburbs district of [[Electoral district of Norwood|Norwood]], held for Labor by former Norwood mayor [[Vini Ciccarello]], was expected to be a tough contest, particularly after the Liberal preselection of former [[Adelaide Crows]] footballer [[Nigel Smart]].<ref name="Key"/> Ciccarello retained the seat picking up a 3.7 percent swing on the two party preferred vote.<ref> Green, Antony. [http://www.abc.net.au/elections/sa/2006/guide/norw.htm South Australian Election 2006: Norwood Electorate Profile], ''ABC News Online'', 20 April 2006.  Retrieved on 15 April 2008.</ref>

The other Labor seat considered under possible threat was the neighbouring inner city district of [[Electoral district of Adelaide|Adelaide]] where high profile Education Minister and former Lord Mayor [[Jane Lomax-Smith]] was challenged by Liberal Diana Carroll.<ref name="Key"/> Lomax-Smith comprehensively defeated Carroll with a 9.2 percent swing to Labor on the two-party preferred vote.<ref> Green, Antony.

====Key Independent seats====

The southern suburbs district of [[Electoral district of Mitchell (South Australia)|Mitchell]] was won at the [[South Australian state election, 2002|2002 election]] by [[Kris Hanna]], who was a Labor member. After the election, Hanna left Labor to join the [[Greens South Australia|Greens]] and subsequently left the Greens to become an independent on 8 February 2006. Hanna faced a tough contest to hold his seat against a challenge by Labor's Rosemary Clancy. Despite expectations before the election of a safe Labor win, Hanna defeated the Labor candidate by 0.6 percent of the vote with the aid of Liberal preferences.<ref>[http://www.pollbludger.com/sa2006/mitchell.htm South Australian House of Assembly Election 2006:  Mitchell], PollBludger.com.  Retrieved on 4 January 2007.</ref>

The district of [[Electoral district of Fisher|Fisher]], located in Adelaide's south, was held by independent MP Dr [[Bob Such]]. Late in the campaign, there was some speculation that Fisher may have been a closer contest than commentators initially expected,<ref name="fisher">Green, Antony. [http://www.abc.net.au/elections/sa/2006/guide/fish.htm South Australian Election 2006:  Fisher Electorate Profile], ''ABC News Online'', 20 April 2006.  Retrieved on 4 January 2007.</ref> but Such comfortably defeated both Labor candidate [[Amanda Rishworth]] and Liberal candidate [[Andy Minnis]] with an independent candidate election best 45.2 percent of the primary vote, picking up a 4.6 percent two party preferred swing. The election outcome saw Such facing the Labor candidate on the two party preferred vote as opposed to the Liberal candidate in 2002.<ref name="fisher"/>

The Riverland based district of [[Electoral district of Chaffey|Chaffey]] is the only seat in South Australia held by a [[Nationals SA]] member. [[River Murray]] Minister [[Karlene Maywald]] won comfortably against a challenge by Liberal Anna Baric. Maywald received a 3.2 percent swing on the two party preferred vote.<ref name="chaffey">Green, Antony.

The [[Murray Bridge, South Australia|Murray Bridge]] based district of [[Electoral district of Hammond|Hammond]] was won in 2002 by independent MP Peter Lewis who cut a deal after the [[South Australian state election, 2002|2002 election]] which delivered government to Labor. Facing almost certain defeat in Hammond, he declined to recontest the district and failed in his attempt to win a seat in the Legislative Council.<ref>[http://www.pollbludger.com/sa2006/hammond.htm South Australia House of Assembly Election 2006:  Hammond], PollBludger.com.  Retrieved on 4 January 2007.</ref><ref name="Results"/>

Hammond was won comfortably by Liberal [[Adrian Pederick]].<ref name="hammond">Green, Antony. [http://www.abc.net.au/elections/sa/2006/guide/hamm.htm South Australian Election 2006: Hammond Electorate Profile], ''ABC News Online'', 20 April 2006.  Retrieved on 15 April 2008.</ref>

The district of [[electoral district of Mount Gambier|Mount Gambier]] (which also includes much of South Australia's south east) was a close contest between independent and Agriculture Minister [[Rory McEwen]] and Liberal Peter Gandolfi. McEwen prevailed despite a 20.4 percent swing against him on the two party preferred vote.<ref name="mtgamb">Green, Antony.

====Post-election pendulum====
{{dablink|For previous pendulums and maps, see [[South Australian legislative elections|South Australian general elections]].}}
The following pendulum<ref>Green, Antony. [http://www.abc.net.au/elections/sa/2006/guide/newpendulumindex.htm South Australian Election 2006: Post-Election Pendulum], ''ABC News online''.  Retrieved on 4 January 2007.</ref> is known as the [[Mackerras Pendulum]], invented by [[psephology|psephologist]] [[Malcolm Mackerras]]. The pendulum works by lining up all of the seats held in the [[South Australian House of Assembly|House of Assembly]] according to the [[percentage point]] margin they are held by on a two party preferred basis. This is also known as the [[Swing (Australian politics)|swing]] required for the seat to change hands. Given a uniform swing to the opposition or government parties, the number of seats that change hands can be predicted. Marginal 0<U+2013>5.99 percent, Fairly Safe 6<U+2013>10 percent, Safe >10 percent.<ref name="Results"/>

After the election, Rob Kerin vacated the position of opposition leader. The party selected conservative [[Iain Evans]] (son of former politician [[Stan Evans]]) for the role, with moderate [[Vickie Chapman]] (daughter of former politician [[Ted Chapman (politician)|Ted Chapman]]) as deputy leader.
