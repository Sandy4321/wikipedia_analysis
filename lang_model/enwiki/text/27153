'''Hans Blumenberg''' was born on [[July 13]], [[1920]] in [[L<U+00FC>beck]], Germany. He studied [[philosophy]], German studies and classics (1939-47, interrupted by [[World War II]]). He died on [[March 28]], [[1996]] in [[Altenberge]] (near [[M<U+00FC>nster]]), Germany.

During his lifetime he was a member of the Senate of the German Research Foundation, a professor at several universities in Germany and a joint founder of the research group "Poetics and Hermeneutics".

He created what has come to be called "Metaphorologism",  which stated that what lies under the metaphor and language modisms, is the nearest to the truth. (And the farest from ideologies).  His last works, specially "The sorrow that crosses the river" (Die Sorge geht <U+00FC>ber den Fluss) are an attempt to apprehend human reality through its metaphors and unvoluntary expressions. Digging under apparently meaningless anecdotes of the history of occidental thought and literature, he tried to draw a map of  the expressions, examples, gestures, that flourished in the discussion of what are thought to be more important matters.  His work is full of a rare beauty, his interpretations are extremely unpredictable and subjective, all full of signs, indications and more or less ironic suggestions. Above all, it is a warning against the force of revealed truth, and for the beauty of a world in confusion.
