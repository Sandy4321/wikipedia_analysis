'''Broward County''' is a [[county]] located in the [[U.S. state]] of [[Florida]]. As of 2000, the [[population]] is 1,623,018; this makes it the second most populated county in the state. According to 2006 [[U.S. Census]] estimates, its population had grown to 1,787,636 [http://www.census.gov/popest/counties/tables/CO-EST2005-01-12.xls]. Its [[county seat]] is [[Fort Lauderdale, Florida]]{{GR|6}}.

It is also the [[fifteenth]] [[List of the most populous counties in the United States|most populous county in the US]].

Broward County is one of three counties that comprise the [[South Florida metropolitan area]].

== History ==
Broward County was created in 1915. It was named for [[Napoleon B. Broward|Napoleon Bonaparte Broward]], [[Governor of Florida]] from 1905 to 1909. In 1915, [[Palm Beach County]] and [[Miami-Dade County, Florida|Dade County]] contributed nearly equal portions of land to create Broward County. By the 1960s, Broward County was considered a leader in agriculture products and services within the State of Florida. The massive buildup of the [[South Florida]] region since the mid 1970s transformed the region, evidenced by the closure of the last major agriculture center within the county ([[Waldrep Dairy Farm]]) in 2003. It was one of the [[county|counties]] at the center of the [[US presidential election, 2000|2000 U.S. Presidential election]] recount controversy. In 2002, it began an aggressive campaign of placing [[surveillance cameras]] along [[highways]] and [[traffic lights]].

== Points Of Interest ==
Broward boasts some notable attractions. The Museum of Science and Discovery is located in Ft. Lauderdale. The [[International Swimming Hall of Fame]] is located near the [[Atlantic Ocean]] in [[Fort Lauderdale]]. The [[International Game Fish Association]] has the [[Hall of Fame for Sport Fishing]] in [[Dania Beach]]. [[Flamingo Gardens]] is a botanical garden and wildlife sanctuary. [[Butterfly World]] is located in [[Coconut Creek]]. [[Sawgrass Mills]], a large shopping mall, is located in [[Sunrise]]. There are also multiple entrances to [[Everglades]] parks.

==Geography==
According to the [[United States Census Bureau|U.S. Census Bureau]], the county has a total area of 3,418 [[km<U+00B2>]] (1,320 [[square mile|sq&nbsp;mi]]). Approximately two-thirds -- 2,194 km<U+00B2> (847 sq&nbsp;mi) -- of the county's area lies in an undeveloped Everglades conservation area. 3,122 km<U+00B2> (1,205 sq&nbsp;mi) of the county's area is land and 296 km<U+00B2> (114 sq&nbsp;mi) of it is [[water]]. The total area is 8.66% water.

Broward approved the construction of [[Osborne Reef]], an [[artificial reef]] made of tires off the Fort Lauderdale beach, but it has proven an environmental disaster.[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/17189132/]

=== 2000 Census ===
As of the [[census]]{{GR|2}} of 2000, there were 1,623,018 people, 654,445 households, and 411,645 families residing in the county. The [[population density]] was 520/km<U+00B2> (1,346/sq&nbsp;mi). There were 741,043 housing units at an average density of 237/km<U+00B2> (615/sq&nbsp;mi). The racial makeup of the county was 70.57% [[Race (United States Census)|White]], 20.54% [[Race (United States Census)|Black]] or [[Race (United States Census)|African American]], 0.24% [[Race (United States Census)|Native American]], 2.25% [[Race (United States Census)|Asian]], 0.06% [[Race (United States Census)|Pacific Islander]], 3.00% from [[Race (United States Census)|other races]], and 3.35% from two or more races. 16.74% of the population were [[Race (United States Census)|Hispanic]] or [[Race (United States Census)|Latino]] of any race.

410,387 residents of Broward County, or 25.3 percent of the total population, are foreign-born. 60,241 of these were born in [[Jamaica]], 47,445 in [[Haiti]], 32,572 in [[Cuba]], 12,776 in [[Peru]], 10,843 in [[Mexico]], 9,189 in the [[United Kingdom]], and 9,015 in the [[Dominican Republic]].

There were 654,445 households out of which 29.30% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 46.1% were [[Marriage|married couples]] living together, 12.5% had a female householder with no husband present, and 37.1% were non-families. 29.6% of all households were made up of individuals and 12.4% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.45 and the average family size was 3.07.

In the county the population was spread out with 23.6% under the age of 18, 7.2% from 18 to 24, 31.4% from 25 to 44, 21.7% from 45 to 64, and 16.1% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 38 years. For every 100 females there were 93.3 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 89.8 males.

The median income for a household in the county was $41,691, and the median income for a family was $50,531. Males had a median income of $36,741 versus $28,529 for females. The [[per capita income]] for the county was $23,170. About 8.7% of families and 11.5% of the population were below the [[poverty line]], including 15.3% of those under age 18 and 10.0% of those age 65 or over.

As of 2005, Broward County led the nation's metropolitan areas in new [[AIDS]] diagnoses, with a reported rate 58.4 new AIDS diagnoses per 100,000 people. County officials think the numbers may stem from a new and successful [[HIV]] testing campaign that has resulted in many people being diagnosed with full-blown AIDS at the same time they've been diagnosed with HIV.[http://www.thebody.com/updates/2005-11-23.html] Ironically, without the implementation of the new testing campaign, the reported numbers of new diagnoses would have probably been lower.

===Languages===
As of 2000, 71.27% of all residents spoke [[english language|English]] as their [[first language]], while 16.33% spoke [[spanish language|Spanish]], 3.51% [[Haitian Creole|French Creole]], 1.77% [[french language|French]], and 1.13% of the population spoke [[Brazilian Portuguese|Portuguese]] as their [[mother language]]. In total, 28.72% of the population spoke languages other than English at home. <ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.mla.org/map_data_results&state_id=12&county_id=11&mode=geographic&zip=&place_id=&cty_id=&ll=&a=&ea=&order=r | title=Modern Language Association Data Center Results, Broward County, Florida | publisher=Modern Language Association | accessdate=2007-06-22}}</ref>

With the huge influx of immigrants since 2000, these figures have become outdated.  However since so many of these immigrants are coming from Caribbean Islands where English is spoken, the change is not as fast as the rate of immigration would suggest.

According to a report released by the U.S. Census Bureau on [[August 4]], [[2006]], the total population of Broward County had risen to 1.8 million people in 2005, and has increased by 10.1% between April 1, 2000-July 1, 2006. This number is accounted for by an increase to 442,355 (24.9%) in its black population and an increase to 364,121 (21.9%) of its non-black Hispanic population. A significant portion of the black population has resulted from [[immigration]], of whom are mainly [[Afro-Caribbean]]s/[[West Indian]]s. Some [[Afro-Latino]]s and [[Afro-Brazilian]]s might also classify themselves as only [[black people|black]]. More black [[foreigner]]s immigrated to Broward County between 2001 and 2005 than any other [[county (United States)|county]] in the United States. At the same time, [[Hispanic]]s have continued to move into the county from neighboring Miami-Dade County and from Latin America, in particular, [[Venezuela]] and [[Colombia]]. Also, 2.9% of Broward County's population is [[Asian]], though not high, it's a larger percentage than most of Florida's counties.

The population change is significant in at least one respect: The percentage of population identified as non-Hispanic white has now dropped to less than half, at 49.9%. As such, Broward County is now "[[minority-majority]]". <ref>[http://www.soflo.org/media/article.asp?articleID=17 "Minorities become a majority in Broward"], ''[[Sun-Sentinel]]'', [[August 4]] [[2006]].

<!-- Image with unknown copyright status removed: [[Image:Districtmap.gif|right|thumb|150px|Commission district map.]] -->
The Broward County [[Charter]] provides for a separation between the legislative and administrative functions of government. The Board of County Commissioners is the legislative branch of Broward County Government.

The County Commission is composed of nine members elected by district. Each Commissioner must be a resident of the district for which he or she seeks election. Each year the Commission elects a [[Mayor]] and [[Vice Mayor]]. The Mayor's functions include serving as presiding officer, and as the County's official representative. The Commission appoints the County Administrator, County Attorney and County Auditor. The Commission also appoints numerous advisory and regulatory boards.

The County Commission meets in formal session the first four Tuesdays of each month at 10:00 a.m. in Room 422 of the Broward County Governmental Center. Over 507,000 cable subscribers in Broward County have access to television coverage of Commission meetings, which are broadcast live beginning at 10:00 a.m. each Tuesday, and rebroadcast at 5:00 p.m. the following Sunday.

==Politics ==
Over the past fifty years, Broward County has gone from solidly [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] to solidly [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]]. In [[1972]], Broward County residents voted overwhelmingly for [[Richard Nixon]] over [[George McGovern]]. In the past two presidential elections, however, the voters of Broward County backed the Democratic nominee over [[George W. Bush]] by strong majorities. Broward County is now one of the most reliably Democratic counties in the state. <ref name="Broward Power">[http://www.sptimes.com/2002/04/28/news_pf/State/Broward_Power.shtml State:Broward Power]. St. Petersburg Times Last accessed November 14, 2006.</ref> This change in voting tendencies is most likely due to the continuous flow from large [[migration]]s of [[snowbird (people)|snowbirds and transplanted people]] from the [[liberal]] [[Northeastern United States|Northeast]] and other [[blue state]]s, as well as [[Canada]], [[Europe]], [[Israel]], and other areas. Also, the fast growing number of [[minority|minorities]] such as [[Black people]] ([[African Americans]] and [[West Indian]]s,) the [[GLBT|GLBT community]], and [[Hispanics]] in the area are a contributing factor.{{Fact|date=November 2007}}

== Transportation ==
===Street grid===
A [[street grid]] stretches throughout Broward County. Most of this grid is loosely based on three primary eastern municipalities, (from South to North) Hollywood, Fort Lauderdale, and Pompano Beach. Deerfield Beach -- another primary eastern municipality -- has its own street grid, as do two smaller municipalities -- Dania and Hallandale.
