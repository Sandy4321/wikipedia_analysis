The '''Waldorf<U+2013>Astoria''' was a pair of two hotels on [[Fifth Avenue]] in [[Manhattan]], [[New York City]] built by feuding relatives. Built in 1893 and expanded in 1897, it was razed in 1929 to make way for construction of the [[Empire State Building]]. Its successor, the current [[Waldorf Astoria New York]], was built on [[Park Avenue]] in 1931. The Waldorf-Astoria Hotel records of 1893-1929 are held by the New York Public Library Archives & Manuscripts division.<ref>{{cite web|title=Waldorf-Astoria Hotel records 1893-1929|url=http://archives.nypl.org/mss/3203|publisher=New York Public Library Archives & Manuscripts|accessdate=7 January 2015}}</ref>

==Location==
The Hotel Waldorf-Astoria was situated on Fifth Avenue in what is now [[Midtown Manhattan]]. It was surrounded by streets on all sides. On Fifth Avenue and Astor Court, it had a frontage of about {{convert|200|ft}} and on each of the sidestreets, Thirty-third and Thirty-fourth Streets, a depth of {{convert|350|ft}}, giving an area of {{convert|70000|sqft}}.{{sfn|The American Architect and Building News Company|1898|p=3}}

==Background==
[[File:Ulysses S. Grant's funeral procession, NYC, 8 Aug 1885.png|thumb|left|Fifth Avenue and 33rd Street (1885). On the right hand side are the residences of John Jacob and William B. Astor. The homes were later razed to build the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel.]]
North of the [[Caspar Samler farm]], extending on Fifth Avenue from near 32nd almost to 36th Streets, were the twenty acres of land bought in 1799 by John Thompson for <U+00A3>482 10s. In 1826, [[John Jacob Astor]] purchased Thompsons parcel, as well as one from Mary and John Murray who owned a farm on Murray Hill, in the area which is now Madison Avenue to Lexington Avenue, between 34th and 38th streets.{{sfn|Craven|2009|p=35}} In 1827, [[William Backhouse Astor, Sr.|William B. Astor, Sr.]] bought a half interest, including Fifth Avenue from 32nd to 35th streets, for US$20,500. He built an unpretentious square red brick house on the southwest corner of 34th Street and Fifth Avenue, while John Jacob Astor erected a home at the northwest corner of 33rd Street. The Waldorf Hotel, named after the little town of [[Walldorf]], Germany, the Astors<U+2019> ancestral home, occupied the former site of John Jacob Astor<U+2019>s house, and was opened for business March 14, 1893. The Astoria, named after [[Astoria, Oregon]] which was founded by John Jacob Astor in 1811, stood on the site of William B. Astor<U+2019>s house and was opened November 1, 1897. The two hotels, under one management, were renamed the Waldorf-Astoria.{{sfn|Biggs|1897|p=29}} The assessed value in 1897 was US$12,1225,000, making it the next most valuable parcel on Fifth Avenue, after the [[B. Altman and Company]] site.{{sfn|Biggs|1897|p=10}}

The first hotel, the Waldorf Hotel, was opened on March 13, 1893 at the corner of Fifth Avenue and 33rd Street, on the site where millionaire developer [[William Waldorf Astor, 1st Viscount Astor|William Waldorf Astor]] had his mansion.{{sfn|Morehouse III|1991|p=20}}<ref name="history">{{cite web|url=http://www.waldorfnewyork.com/about-the-waldorf/hotel-history.html|title=Hotel history|publisher=Waldorfnewyork.com|accessdate=May 30, 2014}}</ref> An immediate success, it earned $4.5 million in its first year, exorbitant for that period.{{sfn|Seifer|1998|p=204}} On November 1, 1897, Waldorf's cousin, [[John Jacob Astor IV]], opened the Astoria Hotel on an adjacent site.<ref name="history"/> The cost of the two buildings, exclusive of the furnishing but including the land, was about US$15 million dollars.{{sfn|The American Architect and Building News Company|1898|p=3}}

William Astor, motivated in part by a dispute with his aunt [[Caroline Webster Schermerhorn Astor]], had built the original Waldorf Hotel next door to her house, on the site of his father's mansion. The hotel was built to the specifications of founding proprietor [[George Boldt]], who owned and operated the [[Bellevue-Stratford Hotel]], an elite boutique hotel on Broad Street in [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]], with his wife Louise. Boldt continued to own the Bellevue even after his relationship with the Astors blossomed. William Astor's construction of a hotel next to his aunt's house worsened his feud with her, but, with Boldt's assistance, John Astor persuaded his mother to move uptown. John Astor then built the Astoria Hotel and leased it to Boldt. The hotels were initially built as two separate structures, but Boldt planned the Astoria so it could be connected to the Waldorf by an alley. Peacock Alley was constructed to connect the two buildings,{{sfn|Morehouse III|1991|p=21}} and the hotel subsequently became known as the "Waldorf-Astoria", the largest hotel in the world at the time.<ref name="cnn">{{cite news |url = http://web.archive.org/web/20081210202259/http://www.cnn.com/2008/CRIME/11/15/waldorf.shooting.ap/index.html?iref=mpstoryview| work=CNN  |title=Guard shot during robbery attempt at Waldorf-Astoria|date=October 17, 2004|accessdate=January 2, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://nyc-architecture.com/GON/GON017.htm|title=The Waldorf Astoria|publisher=''New York Architecture''|accessdate=January 2, 2014}}</ref>

The hotel faced stiff competition from the early 20th century, with a range of new hotels springing up in New York City such the [[Hotel Astor (New York City)|Hotel Astor]] (1904), [[The St. Regis Hotel|The St. Regis]] (1904), [[The Knickerbocker Hotel (Manhattan)|The Knickerbocker]] (1906), and the [[Savoy-Plaza Hotel]] (1927).{{Sfn|Blanke|2002|p=121}} By the 1920s, the hotel was becoming dated, and the elegant social life of New York had moved much farther north than 34th Street. The Astor family sold the hotel to the developers of the [[Empire State Building]] and closed the hotel on May 3, 1929. It was demolished soon after.<ref name="history"/>

The Hotel Waldorf was built by William Waldorf Astor, and opened on March 13, 1893. It is said to have cost US$5,000,000. It had a frontage of {{convert|100|ft}} on Fifth Avenue, and {{convert|250|ft}} on 33rd Street. It was twelve stories, or {{convert|180|ft}} high. It was a German Renaissance structure, designed by [[Henry Janeway Hardenbergh]].{{sfn|King|1893|p=218}} There were fifteen public rooms and 450 guest rooms.{{sfn|Comstock|1898|p=51}} 

The hotel was located at the corner of Fifth Avenue and 33rd Street, on the site where millionaire developer [[William Waldorf Astor, 1st Viscount Astor|William Waldorf Astor]] had previously built his mansion.{{sfn|Morehouse III|1991|p=20}}<ref name="history">{{cite web|url=http://www.waldorfnewyork.com/about-the-waldorf/hotel-history.html|title=Hotel history|publisher=Waldorfnewyork.com|accessdate=May 30, 2014}}</ref> The hotel stood {{convert|225|ft}} high, with a frontage of about {{convert|100|ft}} on Fifth Avenue, with an area of {{convert|69475|ft2}}.{{sfn|Morehouse III|1991|p=132}} The Waldorf measured about {{convert|50|ft}} lower than the Astoria. The total cubic contents of the Waldorf was, roughly speaking, about 16,000,000 of cubic feet.{{sfn|The American Architect and Building News Company|1898|p=3}}

The Waldorf featured loggias, balconies, gables, groups of chimneys, and tiled roofs. One of the chief features was the interior garden court, with fountains and flowers, walls of white terra cotta, frescoes and stained glass. The Empire dining hall was modelled after the grand salon in King Ludwig's palace at Munich, with frescoes, satin hangings, upholstery and marble pillars, all of pale green, and Crowninshield's frescoes. Among the other rooms are the Marie Antoinette parlor, frescoed by Will H. Low; the Turkish smoking-room, with low divans and ancient Moorish armor; the ballroom, in white and gold, with Louis XIV decorations; and the cafe, abounding in carved English oak and leather hangings. The Waldorf State Apartments were located on the second floot and included the Henry IV Drawing Room. The nine room suite featured 16th and 17th century French and Italian antiques which Boldt and his wife had brought back from a trip to Europe.{{sfn|Morrison|2014|p=20}} The Waldorf Restaurant was Empire in style. The columns were of dark-green marble, and the pilasters that came opposite them were of mahogany, with  ormolu work in the panels. The caps and bases of both columns and pilasters were gilded. This treatment occupied most of the wall space. The ceiling was divided by heavy beams running from column to column, and between these the flat space was divided into oval and other shaped panels with light mouldings. The color-scheme was in tints of pale-green and cream-color. Tthe panels of the ceiling were frescoed with figures in pinkish-red on a blue sky or field. The walls were principally mahogany and gold, with a little color in the comparatively small wall-spaces left between openings.{{sfn|Morrison|2014|p=20}}

There were about 6,000 lights. As many as 1,000 were small candelabra lamps mounted in specially designed fixtures. The electric fixtures were all furnished by the Archer & Pancoast Manufacturing Company, of New York, while the contract for the general installation work was carried out by the Edison Electric Illuminating Company, of New York, the actual work of wiring being done by the Eastern District of the General Electric Co. The building was wired throughout on the system of the Interior Conduit and Insulation Company.{{sfn|Electrical Engineer|1893|p=591}}

===Astoria Hotel===
[[File:Astoria Hotel - First Floor Plan.png|thumbnail|left|Astoria's First Floor Plan]]
The Astoria Hotel stood on the southeast corner of Fifth Avenue and Thirty fourth Street, with an area of {{convert|99|x|350|ft}}. The architect was Henry J. Hardenbergh, who designed the Waldorf, which adjoined the Astoria, and was to be operated in connection with it as the Waldorf-Astoria.{{sfn|Comstock|1898|p=51}} The Astoria was built in the German Renaissance style and opened in 1897.<ref name="history"/> Its height, from the floor of the sub-basement, which was {{convert|33|ft}} below the street level, to the roof-line, was about {{convert|270|ft}}, or about {{convert|240|ft}} above the street-level. It was 16 stories in height, including the stories in the roof.{{sfn|The American Architect and Building News Company|1898|p=3}} There were 25 public rooms and 550 guest rooms, with miles of corridors, vestibules and balls.{{sfn|Comstock|1898|p=51}}

There was criticism about the exterior, particularly the Thirty-fourth-Street elevation. It consisted of an immense wall-space penetrated by small, ornamented openings, a colonnade of Ionic columns and a "vigorous and architectural sky line of cupolas, dormers, roof". It was noted that in execution, the parts lacked the proper proportions and locations to make them combine into a passable whole. The Fifth-Avenue and Thirty-third-Street elevations were better in design. Internally, the color, was said to be bad.{{sfn|The American Architect and Building News Company|1898|p=3}} The building was constructed of stone, marble and brick, with a steel skeleton frame and modern fireproof interior construction. It rose {{convert|250|ft}} above the pavement, and the floor of the sub-basement was {{convert|82|ft}} below the sidewalk. The main entrance to the hotel was by the driveway on Thirty-fourth Street. It was a square, {{convert|40|x|40|ft}}, with a semicircular carriage approach, all under cover. The ceiling was tiled, the floor was of stone and asphalt. On its three sides, there were columns enclosing the central space and a second row marking off the promenade. A double set of plate glass doors gave protection in cold weather. To the east of the driveway, was the ladles' reception room {{convert|50|x|50|ft}}. It was finished in Sienna marble, in semi-classic style, with Pompellan red as the principal color. The pilasters and columns had gold bronze caps and bases, while the floor was laid in mosaic. 

The main corridor was nicknamed "Peacock Alley" by the New York press.{{sfn|Morrison|2014|p=53}} The corridor and foyer were treated with pilasters and columns of Sienna marble and a color scheme on the walls and ceilings of salmon-pink, with cream-color and pale-green. The capitals of the columns and pilasters were of solid brass gilded or lacquered. The main corridor, which ran the entire length of the building from east to west, was {{convert|800|ft}} long. To the left of it was the dining room, fronting on Fifth Avenue and measuring {{convert|50|x|92|ft}}. It was Italian Renaissance in style with pilasters and columns carved of marble from northern Russia. The panels of silk hangings were of rose pompadour. A series of mural paintings filled the lunettes, the pendentives of the arches and panels at the south end of the room, the work of [[Charles Yardley Turner]]. On the right of the main corridor was the Garden Court of Palms, {{convert|88|x|57|ft}}, rising three stories to a dome-like roof of amber glass {{convert|56|ft}} above the floor. This, too, was used as a dining room. The decoration was Italian in style, finished in gray, terra cotta and Pavonazzo marble. The ornament was in blue and white.{{sfn|Comstock|1898|p=51}} On the Thirty-fourth Street side of the corridor was the cafe, {{convert|40|x|95|ft}}. It was finished in English oak in the style of the German Renaissance, with Flemish decoration. The bar formed another room {{convert|40|x|50|ft}}.{{sfn|Comstock|1898|p=51}} The assembly-room was in pearl-gray tints, so also was the salon, "Marie Antoinette". The cafe and bar-room were in the style of the German Renaissance. The ballroom, which was three stories in height, with two tiers of boxes. The ballroom had a capacity to seat 700 at banquets and 1,200 at concerts. The style was [[Louis XIV of France|Louis Quatorze]], and the color-scheme was in tints of ivory-gray and cream. The "Colonial Room" was decorated in red, contrasting with white woodwork.{{sfn|The American Architect and Building News Company|1898|p=3}}

On the first floor, at the head-of the east main staircase, was the Astor Gallery, {{convert|87|x|102|ft}}, looking out on Thirty-fourth Street from seven French windows reaching from floor to celling, {{convert|26|ft}}, and opening on a terrace over the entrance to the hotel. The interior was finished in the style of the [[H<U+00F4>tel de Soubise]]. The prevailing color scheme was blue, gray and gold. There was a parquet floor, and on the south side, opposite the street windows, were other windows which opened into the main corridor on the second floor, and from the balconies, commanded a view of the gallery. The musicians' balcony, upheld by two caryatids, was at the east end. All the balcony railings were of gilded metal work. The mural paintings were notable: four panels, two at either end of the room, and twelve pendentive panels, six on either side and painted by Edward Simmons depicted the four seasons and the twelve months of the year.{{sfn|Comstock|1898|p=51}} 

The second floor contained a private suite of apartments at the northeast corner, with large drawing rooms, dining room, butler's pantry, hallway, three bedrooms, three maids' bedrooms and five bathrooms, all finished in old English oak. All the floors above the third were given up to suites and bedrooms up to the 14th floor. There was a bath for nearly every room, and every bathroom had windows opening to the air, not into shafts. In every room, there was a large trunk closet.{{sfn|Comstock|1898|p=55}} 

On the roof on the Thirty-fourth Street side was the grand promenade, {{convert|90|x|200|ft}}, on solid footing high in the air, with a band stand, fountains, and trellises of columns. The roof garden restaurant occupied a space {{convert|75|x|84|ft}}, and was roofed in. The ceiling was {{convert|24|ft}} high. At the northeast and northwest corners of the roof garden were towers, with spiral stairways within, leading up to the copper covered roofs of the pavilions, which were {{convert|250|ft}} above the sidewalk.{{sfn|Comstock|1898|p=51}} 

In the sub-basement were the Sprague screw machines for the electric elevators, the fire pumps, the house pumps, the ice plant, and the six Babcock & Wilcox waler tube boilers. The elevator system, which served the house from subbasement to roof, was electric, taking its power from the generating plant within the building. There were 18 elevators.{{sfn|Comstock|1898|p=51}}

The Waldorf and the Astoria were two separate hotels, built next to each other; the Waldorf-Astoria was a result of their union.{{sfn|Morrison|2014|p=7}} The hotel became, according to author Sean Dennis Cashman, "a successful symbol of the opulence and achievement of the Astor family".{{sfn|Cashman|1988|p=373}} On the exterior, the two and three lower stories in the respective buildings were of red sandstone, while the balance of the work to the roof-line was red brick and red terra-cotta. The building rested on solid rock and containwed a fireproof steel frame.{{sfn|The American Architect and Building News Company|1898|p=3}} 

There were 1,300 bedrooms and 178 bathrooms.{{sfn|The American Architect and Building News Company|1898|p=3}} With a telephone in every room and first-class room service, the hotel was designed specifically to cater to the needs of socially prominent "wealthy upper crust" of New York and distinguished foreign visitors to the city.{{sfn|Bernardo|2010|p=40}}{{sfn|Morehouse III|1991|p=8}} It was the first hotel to offer complete electricity and private bathrooms.<ref name="fact">{{cite web|url=http://www.scps.nyu.edu/export/sites/scps/pdf/tisch/HotelFactSheet.pdf|title=Hotel fact sheet|publisher=[[New York University]] School of Professional Studies|year=2009|accessdate=January 5, 2015}}</ref> The bedrooms and corridors were heated by direct radiation.{{sfn|The American Architect and Building News Company|1898|p=3}}

On the top floor was the roof-garden, enclosed on all sides by glass, with a glass roof over. It was furnished with rattan chairs and lounges in pale-green and pink, hung across with gauzy fabric.{{sfn|The American Architect and Building News Company|1898|p=3}} The palm gardens rose to a height of two and three stories respectively and were roofed-over with domes of tinted glass. Balconies at the various floorlevels opened on to these courts to overlook them. The materials used were cream-colored brick and terra-cotta, and were Italian Renaissance in style. They were used as cafes.{{sfn|The American Architect and Building News Company|1898|p=3}} The Waldorf Astoria Bar was a favorite haunt of many of the financial elite of the city from the hotel's inception in 1893, such as [[Diamond Jim Brady]], [[Buffalo Bill Cody]] and [[Bat Masterson]].<ref name="Dining">{{cite web|url=http://www.waldorfnewyork.com/the-towers/dining.html|title=Dining|publisher=Waldorfnewyork.com|accessdate=January 5, 2015}}</ref> A number of cocktails were invented at the bar, including the [[Rob Roy (cocktail)|Rob Roy]] (1894) and the [[Bobby Burns (drink)|Bobbie Burns]].<ref name="fact"/>

The machinery was located in the sub-basement. The boilers aggregated about 3,000 horse power, the electric generators taking 2,200 horse-power of the total energy. The elevators were run by it, as were the 15,000 incandescent lamps, branching from 7,500 outlets. The system of heating and ventilating the public rooms was that of forced draught by means of powerful blowers situated in the sub-basement that forced the fresh air between steam-coils, where it became moderately heated before entering the ducts that lead it to the various rooms. This heat was further augmented by direct radiators placed behind screens in the recesses of the windows and elsewhere.{{sfn|The American Architect and Building News Company|1898|p=3}}

==Society==
[[File:NY_Octagon_Room_Waldof_Astoria_Hotel_1893.jpg|thumb|right|x138px|The Waldorf's Octagon Room, 1893]]

The Waldorf Astoria was influential in advancing the status of women, who were admitted singly without escorts. George Boldt's wife, [[Louise Kehrer Boldt]], was influential in evolving the idea of the grand urban hotel as a social center, particularly in making it appealing to women as a venue for social events. On February 11, 1899, Oscar hosted a lavish dinner reception which the ''New York Herald Tribune'' cited as the city's costliest dinner at the time. Some $250 was spent per guest, with bluepoint oysters, green turtle soup, lobster, ruddy duck and blue raspberries.{{sfn|Morehouse III|1991|p=32}}

The Waldorf gained significant renown for its fundraising dinners and balls, regularly attracting notables of the day such as [[Andrew Carnegie]] who became a fixture.{{Sfn|Nasaw|2007|p=841}} The [[United States Senate inquiry into the sinking of the RMS Titanic|United States Senate inquiry into the sinking of the RMS ''Titanic'']] was opened at the hotel on April 19, 1912 and continued there for some time in the Myrtle Room,{{sfn|Kuntz|Smith|1998|p=77}} before moving on to [[Washington, D.C.]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.history.com/news/six-degrees-of-titanic|title=Six Degrees of Titanic|work=History.com|accessdate=October 7, 2014}}</ref> John Jacob Astor IV was one of the people who perished on its ill-fated journey.

Tschirky had arrived in the United States from Switzerland ten years prior to applying for the position at the new Waldorf and over the years grew to possess an encyclopedic-like knowledge of cuisine and the special trimmings and preferences that the regular diners desired.{{Sfn|Smith|2007|p=595}} He authored ''The Cookbook by Oscar of The Waldorf'' (1896), a 900 page book featuring all of the popular recipes of the day, including his own, for which he garnered great acclaim, such as [[Waldorf salad]], [[Eggs Benedict]] and [[Thousand Island dressing]], which remain popular worldwide today. James Remington McCarthy wrote in his book ''Peacock Alley'' that Oscar gained renown among the general public as an artist who "composed sonatas in soups, symphonies in salads, minuets in sauces, lyrics in entrees".{{Sfn|Smith|2007|p=595}} In 1902 Tschirky published ''Serving a Course Dinner by Oscar of the Waldorf-Astoria'', a booklet which explains the intricacies of being a cater to the American and international elite.{{Sfn|Smith|2007|p=595}}
