'''Zhang Jiao''' or '''Zhang Jue''' (d. [[184]]) ([[Simplified Chinese]]: <U+5F20><U+89D2>; [[Traditional Chinese]]: <U+5F35><U+89D2>; [[Pinyin]]: Zh<U+0101>ng Ji<U+01CE>o or Zh<U+0101>ng Ju<U+00E9>)  was the leader of the [[Yellow Turban]]s during the late [[Eastern Han Dynasty]] of [[China]]. He was said to be a sorcerer, and was a follower of [[Taoism]]. 

==The Rebellion==
Giving himself the title of "Great Teacher", he led the [[Yellow Turban Rebellion]] with his younger brothers [[Zhang Bao]] and [[Zhang Liang (Yellow Turban)|Zhang Liang]] in a campaign called "The Way of Heaven" or "The Way of Peace". He and his brothers had their own power. Zhang Bao was the general of land, and his brother general of people. And Zhang Jiao was the general of heaven. The Yellow Turbans claimed to be Taoists, and rebelled against the Han because of the high taxes placed against them. They conquered much in the early years of the rebellion, but when the Han sent out a distress call, gaining the talent of people such as [[Liu Bei]], [[Cao Cao]] and [[Sun Jian]], the lack of ability of his generals showed. The Yellow Turbans; however, were still a strong threat until the death of Zhang Jiao; when, due to a lack of a good leader, it imploded on itself.

It is said that Zhang Jiao is the grandson of the founder of the [[Tianshi Dao]] (Celestial Masters) Sect of Taoism, [[Zhang Daoling]].

==In ''Romance of the Three Kingdoms''==
Zhang Jiao (Zhang Jue) also features in the historical novel, ''[[Romance of the Three Kingdoms]]''.  Zhang's character is introduced in the [[s:Romance of the Three Kingdoms/Chapter 1#4|first chapter of the book]]:
<blockquote>At that time, there lived three brothers in [[Julu County (Han Dynasty)|Julu County]]: '''Zhang Jue''', Zhang Bao and Zhang Liang.  '''Zhang Jue''' was a failure in the county level examination.  He had gone into the mountains to gather some medicinal herbs, when he came across an old man; the old man had a youthful countenance, and was carrying a pigweed walking stick.  The old man beckoned '''Jue''' into a cave, presented him with a book in three volumes which had come from the heavens, then said, "This book is called ''[[Taiping Jing|The Essential Art of Great Peace]]''.  Once you have mastered its contents, you will represent the heavens in spreading this knowledge, and thereby save all of mankind.  If you start to have second thoughts, there will be terrible consequences for you."  '''Jue''' enquired as to the old man's name.  The old man said, "I am the old immortal spirit from the southern lands."  With that, the old man vanished into thin air.<br><br>

Upon receiving this book, '''Jue''' practiced night and day.  Eventually, he could summon the wind and rain, and came to be known as the ''Great Peace Daoist''. ([[Wikisource]] translation)</blockquote>
:*Note: Zhang's given name, while written the same way in Chinese, is either Jue or Jiao in English.  Jue is the more traditional reading; Jiao is more modern.

He then goes on to found the rebellion known as the Yellow Turban Rebellion. Little time is devoted to Zhang Jue in the book, and his death is given a line in the second chapter: ''"Zhang Jue had died before his ([[Huangfu Song]]'s) arrival."''

The Taoist saint who supplied the codex was almost certainly [[Huang-lao]].{{Fact|date=August 2007}}

Zhang Jiao is a playable character in the [[Koei]] video game series, ''[[Dynasty Warriors]]''. He is portrayed as a magician with a rather ridiculous manner of speech. He is known to frequently mention the word "Heaven" during speeches, and wields a sword in his debut appearance, ''[[Dynasty Warriors 2]]''. In all successive installments, however, his weapon is the magical "Volcano Staff," capable of spitting fire at opponents on the battlefield, although he can also use it to create much more grandiose spells and effects when presented with enough time, extra effort and the assistance of his brothers. Although Zhang Jiao is portrayed as an antagonist in the series, this is merely due to difference in perception regarding how China should be united in peace. Similar to opposing political beliefs between party factions, The Yellow Turban and Han forces can be viewed in similar regard to the opposing beliefs of socialism and capitalism as functional social foundations. Zhang Jiao seeks to remove the Han leadership he views as corrupt and abusive of their positions, who heavily tax and abuse the peasants they have been charged with serving, which was indeed true. The regional warlords also seek to unite the land, although they also wish to gain power in the process, putting them at odds with Zhang Jiao's attempts to remove the governing Han leadership which supports and empowers the regional warlords. These warlords also believe that Zhang Jiao's revolution will cause massive amounts of damage and death in the process, which was also true. Therefore, it is the player's responsibility to decide which faction is right/wrong and who is justified in the actions they have taken.

Zhang Jiao also appears in the Koei video game ''[[Warriors Orochi]]''.  He forms the Yellow Turbans and allies with [[Xiao Qiao]] and [[Okuni]], who have become friends. They are an independent force, eventually joining [[Oda Nobunaga]]'s army.
