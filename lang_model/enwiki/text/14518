'''US Highway&nbsp;23''' ('''US&nbsp;23''')  is a [[United States Numbered Highway]] that runs from [[Jacksonville, Florida]], to [[Mackinaw City, Michigan]]. In the US state of [[Michigan]], it is a major, {{convert|362|mi|km|adj=mid|-long}}, north<U+2013>south [[Michigan State Trunkline Highway System|state trunkline highway]] that runs through the [[Lower Peninsula of Michigan|Lower Peninsula]] (LP). The trunkline is a [[freeway]] from the Michigan<U+2013>[[Ohio]] state line near [[Lambertville, Michigan|Lambertville]] to the city of [[Standish, Michigan|Standish]], and it follows the [[Lake Huron]] shoreline from there to its northern terminus. Serving the cities of [[Ann Arbor, Michigan|Ann Arbor]] and [[Flint, Michigan|Flint]], US&nbsp;23 acts as a freeway bypass of the [[Metro Detroit]] area. Overall, the highway runs through rural areas of the state dominated by farm fields or woodlands; some segments are urban in character in the Ann Arbor, Flint and [[Tri-Cities (Michigan)#The Greater Tri-Cities Region|Tri-Cities]] areas. The section from Flint north to Standish also carries [[Interstate 75 in Michigan|Interstate 75]] (I-75) along a [[concurrency (road)|concurrency]] that includes a segment that carries almost 70,000&nbsp;vehicles on a daily basis.

The first transportation routes along what is now US&nbsp;23 in the state were sections of two [[Native Americans in the United States|Indian]] trails. The route of what is now US&nbsp;23 follows portions of two separate trails. In the early 20th century, four different [[auto trail]] names were applied to roads now a part of the highway. These roads were included as part of two state highways in the initial state highway system in 1919. When the United States Numbered Highway System was first designated on November 11, 1926, the new US&nbsp;23 replaced the other designations along its route. Since creation, the road has been moved and realigned several times. Through the 1930s and 1940s, the lakeshore routing was created to replace a path that run further inland through the [[Northern Michigan|northern portion]] of the state. Starting in the early 1950s, various sections in the southeastern and central areas of the LP were upgraded to freeways, bypassing several major cities in the area. These improvements were completed by the end of the 1960s. Since then a new crossing of the [[Saginaw River]] at [[Zilwaukee, Michigan|Zilwaukee]] was built to replace a drawbridge that carried the I-75/US&nbsp;23 freeway over a shipping channel.

Various memorial or tourist route designations have been applied to US&nbsp;23 in the state since the 1980s. The highway has been a part of the [[Lake Huron Circle Tour]] since the creation of the [[Great Lakes Circle Tour]]s in 1986. The non-freeway section was designated the '''Sunrise Side Coastal Highway''' by the [[Michigan Department of Transportation]] (MDOT) in 2004 as a part of the [[Michigan Heritage Route]] program. The highway has also carried two memorial designations related to war veterans and a third related to local civic leaders since a 2001 consolidation of related legislation in the state. MDOT has listed two of the highway's bridges on its historic bridge list, one of which is also on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] (NRHP). Future improvements to the route of US&nbsp;23 include a proposed northerly extension of the freeway from Standish to one of several locations along the Lake Huron shoreline. Another freeway has been proposed in the Flint area that could connect US&nbsp;23 directly to the south end of [[Interstate 475 (Michigan)|I-475]].

==Route description==
US&nbsp;23 runs for {{convert|362.152|mi|km}} through the LP of Michigan, serving as a freeway bypass to the west of [[Metro Detroit]] and a scenic highway  through the [[Northern Michigan|northern portion]] of the state along Lake Huron.  Between [[Flint, Michigan|Flint]] and [[Standish, Michigan|Standish]], US&nbsp;23 [[concurrency (road)|runs concurrently]] with [[Interstate 75 in Michigan|I-75]];<ref name=MDOT10/> the combined freeway section from Flint to [[Bay City, Michigan|Bay City]] can contain between six and eight lanes total while the rest of the US&nbsp;23 freeway is mostly four lanes. Non-freeway segments of US&nbsp;23 in the state are two lanes.<ref name=google/> Like other state trunkline highways, it is maintained by the [[Michigan Department of Transportation]] (MDOT). All of US&nbsp;23 in the state south of the [[M-32 (Michigan highway)|M-32]] junction in [[Alpena, Michigan|Alpena]] has been listed on the [[National Highway System (United States)|National Highway System]],<ref name=NHS-MI>{{cite map |title= National Highway System, Michigan |date=April 23, 2006 |publisher=Michigan Department of Transportation |url= http://www.michigan.gov/documents/MDOT_NHS_Statewide_150626_7.pdf |format=PDF |cartography= MDOT |accessdate=October 7, 2008}}</ref> a network of roads important to the country's economy, defense, and mobility.<ref name=NHS>{{cite web |first1= Stefan |last1= Natzke |first2= Mike |last2= Neathery |first3= Kevin |last3= Adderly |url= http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/planning/national_highway_system/ |title= What is the National Highway System? |work= National Highway System |publisher= Federal Highway Administration |date= June&nbsp;20, 2012 |accessdate= July&nbsp;1, 2012 |lastauthoramp=y}}</ref> From the Standish area north, the highway is also a part of the [[Lake Huron Circle Tour]] and the Sunrise Side Coastal Highway, a [[Michigan Heritage Route]].<ref name=MDOT10/>

===Southeastern Michigan===
[[File:US 23 MI exit 3.jpg|thumb|left|Freeway approaching exit&nbsp;3 in southern Monroe County|alt=Photograph of the ]]
US&nbsp;23 enters Michigan on a freeway northwest of [[Toledo, Ohio]], concurrent with [[U.S. Route 223|US&nbsp;223]]. This freeway runs north through farm fields in rural western [[Monroe County, Michigan|Monroe County]] near [[Lambertville, Michigan|Lambertville]]. About {{convert/spell|5|mi}} north of the state line, US&nbsp;223 leaves the freeway and turns west onto St. Anthony Road; US&nbsp;23 continues northward on the freeway. South of [[Dundee, Michigan|Dundee]], US&nbsp;23 crosses the [[River Raisin]] before coming to an interchange with [[M-50 (Michigan highway)|M-50]] next to the [[Cabela's]] store west of town. North of town, the freeway passes near an industrial area.<ref name=MDOT10/><ref name=google/> Farther north, it crosses a line of the [[Ann Arbor Railroad (1988)|Ann Arbor Railroad]]<ref name=MDOT-RR/> near [[Azalia, Michigan|Azalia]] as the trunkline runs to the east of [[Milan, Michigan|Milan]] at the Monroe-[[Washtenaw County, Michigan|Washtenaw]] county line.<ref name=MDOT10/><ref name=google/> North of Milan, the freeway crosses a line of the [[Norfolk Southern Railway]].<ref name=MDOT-RR/>

The landscape takes on a more suburban residential character as the freeway approaches the Ann Arbor area. There are separate interchanges for [[U.S. Route 12 in Michigan|US&nbsp;12]] (Michigan Avenue) and [[Interstate 94 in Michigan|I-94]] on the southeast side of the city. Between I-94 and Washtenaw Avenue, US&nbsp;23 carries the [[Interstate 94 Business (Ann Arbor, Michigan)|Business Loop I-94]] (BL I-94) moniker as well. That secondary designation leaves the freeway and runs west on Washtenaw Avenue into downtown Ann Arbor and the campus of the [[University of Michigan]]. At the same interchange, a [[U.S. Route 23 Business (Ann Arbor, Michigan)|Business US 23]] (BUS US&nbsp;23) designation also follows Washtenaw Avenue to the west; east of US&nbsp;23, M-17 follows Washtenaw Avenue and connects the freeway with Ypsilanti. North of this interchange, US&nbsp;23 crosses the [[Huron River (Michigan)|Huron River]] near the campus of [[Washtenaw Community College|the local community college]] and continues north to a junction with the [[M-14 (Michigan highway)|M-14]] freeway. The two merge and run westward along the north side of the city before US&nbsp;23 turns north and M-14 curves south.<ref name=MDOT10/><ref name=google/>

North of Ann Arbor, the freeway runs through woodlands and near several lakes. In the community of [[Whitmore Lake, Michigan|Whitmore Lake]], US&nbsp;23 crosses into [[Livingston County, Michigan|Livingston County]] near the city's namesake body of water. East of [[Brighton, Michigan|Brighton]], the freeway intersects [[Interstate 96|I-96]] and continues north to an intersection with [[M-59 (Michigan highway)|M-59]] south of [[Hartland, Michigan|Hartland]]. The highway turns northeasterly by Runyon Lake and runs toward the city of [[Fenton, Michigan|Fenton]]. The trunkline passes through town and bends back toward the northwest, running between lakes Ponemah and Fenton. Continuing north, the environment around US&nbsp;23 transitions to rural farm fields as the freeway approaches the south side of the Flint area.<ref name=MDOT10/><ref name=google/>

===Flint and the Tri-Cities area===

West of [[Grand Blanc, Michigan|Grand Blanc]], US&nbsp;23 meets I-75, and the two freeways merge near the [[Bishop International Airport]] and continue along the west side of the Flint metro area.<ref name=MDOT10/><ref name=google/> I-75/US&nbsp;23 has an interchange with [[Interstate 69 in Michigan|I-69]] near the crossing with the [[Canadian National Railway]] line.<ref name=MDOT-RR/> Continuing northwards through suburban residential areas, the highway crosses the [[Flint River (Michigan)|Flint River]] while running along the west side of the city. In [[Mount Morris Township, Michigan|Mount Morris Township]], the freeway intersects the northern end of [[Interstate 475 (Michigan)|I-475]] before meeting [[M-57 (Michigan highway)|M-57]] near [[Clio, Michigan|Clio]].<ref name=MDOT10/><ref name=google/> The highest traffic totals along US&nbsp;23 in the state of Michigan were recorded by MDOT near the M-57 interchange; in 2009 an average 68,800&nbsp;vehicles used that section of freeway daily.<ref name=TMIS/> These traffic counts are expressed in terms of [[annual average daily traffic]] (AADT), which is a statistical calculation of the average daily number of vehicles on a segment of roadway.

Near [[Birch Run, Michigan|Birch Run]], the highway turns northwesterly next to a large outlet mall. Between here and the Saginaw area, the freeway runs through more wooded lands, crossing the [[Cass River (Michigan)|Cass River]] near [[Bridgeport, Michigan|Bridgeport]]. I-75/US&nbsp;23 enters the [[Tri-Cities (Michigan)#The Greater Tri-Cities Region|Tri-Cities]] (named for [[Saginaw, Michigan|Saginaw]], Bay City and [[Midland, Michigan|Midland]]) when it bypasses Saginaw to the east. The freeway intersects [[M-46 (Michigan highway)|M-46]] in the suburb of [[Buena Vista, Michigan|Buena Vista]] south of the junction with [[Interstate 675 (Michigan)|I-675]]. North of downtown Saginaw, the freeway crosses the [[Saginaw River]] on the [[Zilwaukee Bridge]],<ref name=MDOT10/><ref name=google/> a "[[Post-tensioned concrete|post-tensioned]], segmental, [concrete] [[box girder bridge]]"<ref name=hyde168>[[#Hyde|Hyde]], p. 168.</ref> that is "infamous" for a series of "construction mishaps, cost overruns, and government foibles."<ref>{{cite news |last=Banas |first=Teri |url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=8V0iAAAAIBAJ&sjid=76kFAAAAIBAJ&pg=1261,1191950&dq=zilwaukee+bridge+infamous&hl=en |title=Bridge Makes City Famous: Residents Say Life is Good in Zilwaukee |work=[[Argus-Press]] |location=Owosso, MI |agency=[[Associated Press]] |page=29 |date=September 15, 1987 |oclc= 36134862}}</ref>

[[File:US 23 northern freeway end.jpg|thumb|left|Northern end of the freeway near Standish|alt=Photograph of]]
Past the bridge, I-75/US&nbsp;23 meets the northern end of I-675 and continues through fields and woods to the Bay City area. At exit&nbsp;162, the freeway meets the eastern terminus of [[U.S. Route 10 in Michigan|US&nbsp;10]] and the western terminus of [[M-25 (Michigan highway)|M-25]] west of downtown. The next interchange north is with the [[M-13 Connector (Michigan highway)|Connector M-13]] (CONN M-13) freeway, which was the previous northern end of US&nbsp;23's freeway in Michigan. The connector runs due northward, and I-75/US&nbsp;23 turns northwesterly to bypass around [[Kawkawlin, Michigan|Kawkawlin]]. The highway veers north, crosses the [[Kawkawlin River]] and the Pinconning Creek before coming to an interchange southwest of Standish. There, US&nbsp;23 curves east, separating from I-75. US&nbsp;23 continues for about {{convert/spell|3|mi|km}} as a freeway which ends at the intersection with [[M-13 (Michigan highway)|M-13]] south of Standish.<ref name=MDOT10/><ref name=google/> The lowest AADT along any freeway section of US&nbsp;23 in Michigan is the section immediately east of I-75; here the traffic levels drop from 20,763&nbsp;to 4,466&nbsp;vehicles per day after US&nbsp;23 separates from I-75.<ref name=TMIS/>

===Northern Michigan===
US&nbsp;23 runs north from the end of its freeway along Huron Road through the community of Standish. The trunkline turns northeasterly  through lakeshore woodlands after the intersection with [[M-76 (Michigan highway)|Old M-76]].<ref name=MDOT10/><ref name=google/> Northeast of this intersection, the highest, non-freeway AADT level on US&nbsp;23 was recorded by MDOT at 16,757&nbsp;vehicles daily.<ref name=TMIS/> Running through [[Omer, Michigan|Omer]], the highway crosses the [[Rifle River]]<ref name=MDOT10/><ref name=google/> and a line of the [[Lake State Railway]].<ref name=MDOT-RR>{{cite map |url=http://www.michigan.gov/documents/MDOT_Official_Rail_130897_7.pdf |title=Michigan's Railroad System |publisher=Michigan Department of Transportation |cartography= MDOT |date = April 2009|accessdate=September 14, 2010 |format=PDF}}</ref> In between the two crossings, it curves due east on its way out of town. At Hale Road, US&nbsp;23 meets the southern end of [[M-65 (Michigan highway)|M-65]] before it continues east to [[Au Gres, Michigan|Au Gres]], where it runs along the [[Saginaw Bay]] and crosses the [[Au Gres River]]. Huron Road meanders northward along the lakeshore, staying inland near Point Lookout. US&nbsp;23 runs through woods as it follows the Saginaw Bays shoreline northeasterly through [[Alabaster, Michigan|Alabaster]] to [[Tawas City, Michigan|Tawas City]]. The highway intersects the eastern terminus of [[M-55 (Michigan highway)|M-55]], runs north and east around [[Tawas Bay]] to [[East Tawas, Michigan|East Tawas]] and follows the Lake Huron shoreline to [[Oscoda, Michigan|Oscoda]].<ref name=MDOT10/><ref name=google/> Through this area, US&nbsp;23 runs parallel to the Lake State Railway and crosses into the [[Huron National Forest]].<ref name=MDOT-RR/><ref name=RMN08>{{cite map |publisher= [[Rand McNally]] |year=2008 |title=The Road Atlas |edition=2008 |pages=50<U+2013>1 |section=F8<U+2013>T11 |cartography= Rand McNally |isbn=0-528-93981-5}}</ref>

[[File:US 23 Omer Michigan.jpg|thumb|right|Welcome sign at Omer|alt=Photograph of]]
Oscoda is the location of the eastern termini of both the [[River Road National Scenic Byway]] and County Road [[F-41 (Michigan county highway)|F-41]]. In between those two junctions, the highway crosses the [[Au Sable River (Michigan)|Au Sable River]] near its mouth, and the trunkline passes by the former [[Wurtsmith Air Force Base]]. Huron Road continues north, running next to Van Etten Lake as it leaves the national forest. Further north, it runs along Cedar Lake when it crosses into [[Alcona County, Michigan|Alcona County]].<ref name=google/><ref name=RMN08/> The highway meets the eastern termini of [[F-30 (Michigan county highway)|F-30]] and [[M-72 (Michigan highway)|M-72]] in [[Greenbush, Michigan|Greenbush]] and [[Harrisville, Michigan|Harrisville]] respectively. It also passes [[Harrisville State Park]] in the latter community. The highway shifts a bit further inland north of Harrisville, continuing to parallel the railroad through the [[Mackinaw State Forest]]. Near [[Ossineke, Michigan|Ossineke]], the trunkline turns back toward the lake, running along the shoreline of [[Thunder Bay (Michigan)|Thunder Bay]].<ref name=MDOT10/><ref name=google/>

When US&nbsp;23 enters Alpena, it follows State Street through town and turns northwesterly on Chisholm Street. The intersection of Chisholm and Washington streets marks the eastern terminus of M-32. Chisholm Street runs along the [[Thunder Bay River]] and crosses the river near Lake Besser. The highway leaves town and runs through rural woodlands to the south shore of Long Lake, curving around the eastern side of the lake. Near the northern end of the lake, US&nbsp;23 crosses into [[Presque Isle County, Michigan|Presque Isle County]] and runs along the west shore of Grand Lake. At the north end of that lake, the highway turns west along the Lake Huron shoreline near [[Thompson's Harbor State Park]]. The trunkline continues to [[Rogers City, Michigan|Rogers City]] where it bypasses town to the south and west, intersecting [[F-21 (Michigan county highway)|F-21]] and [[M-68 (Michigan highway)|M-68]] in the process; [[U.S. Route 23 Business (Rogers City, Michigan)|BUS US&nbsp;23]] runs through downtown. On the other side of Rogers City, US&nbsp;23 runs along the lake past [[Hoeft State Park]] and along Hammond Bay before crossing into [[Cheboygan County, Michigan|Cheboygan County]].<ref name=MDOT10/><ref name=google/> This area had the lowest AADT levels in 2009 at 1,097&nbsp;vehicles per day.<ref name=TMIS>{{cite web |author= Bureau of Transportation Planning |url=http://mdotnetpublic.state.mi.us/tmispublic/ |title= Traffic Monitoring Information System |publisher=Michigan Department of Transportation |year=2008 |accessdate=April 19, 2011}}</ref>

US&nbsp;23 follows the Lake Huron shoreline through Cheboygan County through woodlands past [[Cheboygan State Park]] and Duncan Bay. On the eastern edge of [[Cheboygan, Michigan|Cheboygan]] the highway intersects [[F-05 (Michigan county highway)|F-05]] before following State Street through a commercial district. State Street crosses the [[Cheboygan River]] on the [[Cheboygan Bascule Bridge]] near the mouth of the river and the dock for the [[USCGC Mackinaw (WLBB-30)|USCGC ''Mackinaw'']]. On the west side of the river, US&nbsp;23 meets the northern terminus of [[M-27 (Michigan highway)|M-27]] at the intersection with Main Street. State Street continues westerly as [[C-66 (Michigan county highway)|C-66]] as US&nbsp;23 turns north on Main Street for a block before resuming west on Mackinaw Avenue. The highway continues along the lake toward [[Mackinaw City, Michigan|Mackinaw City]]. As it approaches the village, it passes [[Historic Mill Creek State Park]] and several motels. At Nicolet Street in town, the highway crosses into [[Emmet County, Michigan|Emmet County]] for the short distance to the highway's national northern terminus at I-75's exit&nbsp;338.<ref name=MDOT10>{{cite map |publisher=Michigan Department of Transportation |title=Official Department of Transportation Map |year=2010 |cartography= MDOT |scale= 1&nbsp;in:15&nbsp;mi/1&nbsp;cm:9&nbsp;km |section= D10<U+2013>N12}}</ref><ref name=google>{{google maps |url=http://maps.google.com/maps?f=d&source=s_d&saddr=US-223+N%2FUS-23+N&daddr=44.51804,-83.31942+to:45.71395,-84.58677+to:Unknown+road&hl=en&geocode=FZayfAIdBAMD-w%3BFZhKpwIdhKUI-ynpYdB6vEAniDEhlNaRYPQebw%3BFR6KuQId7k71-ildB0LSM5I1TTHLdMnxHGdOYQ%3BFfZyugIdww_z-g&mra=ls&via=1,2&sll=45.755308,-84.725275&sspn=0.055994,0.058193&ie=UTF8&t=h&z=7 |title=Overview Map of US&nbsp;23 in Michigan |accessdate= April 18, 2011}}</ref>

Before Michigan became a state, the first land transportation corridors were the [[Native Americans in the United States|Indian]] trails.<ref name=morrison1>[[#Morrison|Morrison]], p. 1.</ref> The original Shore Trail ran roughly parallel to the route of the modern US&nbsp;23 from the [[Bay City, Michigan|Bay City]] area to Cheboygan. Another section of the current highway followed the [[Saginaw Trail]] between Flint and Saginaw.<ref name=mason18>[[#Mason|Mason]], p.&nbsp;18.</ref>

Later, during the [[auto trail]] era, the modern US&nbsp;23 also coincided with the east branch of the [[Dixie Highway]] and part of the Lower Peninsula section of the [[Theodore Roosevelt International Highway]]. The Dixie Highway was created by William S. Gilbreath after he developed the [[Lincoln Highway]]. The highway was designed to link the Great Lakes with the [[Gulf of Mexico]], and to commemorate a half century of peace between the North and the South after the [[American Civil War]]. At the urging of Governor [[Woodbridge Ferris]], the northern terminus was located at the Straits of Mackinac. The highway had two branches in the Lower Peninsula; the eastern branch followed what later became US&nbsp;23 north of Standish.<ref name=barnett74>[[#Barnett|Barnett]], pp.&nbsp;74<U+2013>5.</ref> The Theodore Roosevelt International Highway was named for former US president [[Theodore Roosevelt]] after his death in 1919. Overall, this highway ran from [[Portland, Oregon]], to [[Portland, Maine]], by way of Michigan and the Canadian province of [[Ontario]]. In Michigan, it also followed US&nbsp;23 north of Standish.<ref name=barnet211>[[#Barnett|Barnett]], pp.&nbsp;211<U+2013>2.</ref>

The highway was also part of the East Michigan Pike, designed to be a counterpart of the West Michigan Pike on the other side of the LP. The original route of the East Michigan Pike included a section along the coast of [[The Thumb]] between Bay City and [[Port Huron, Michigan|Port Huron]] and used the same route as the Dixie Highway north of Bay City. Backers of this auto trail lost out in terms of name recognition to the Dixie Highway, relegating the East Michigan Pike to the list of failed auto trails.<ref name=barnett80>[[#Barnett|Barnett]], p.&nbsp;80.</ref> The southern part of what is now US&nbsp;23 in the state was also part of the auto trail craze. The Top of Michigan Trail was designated in 1917 from the state line north to the Bay City area, before turning inland along other roadways. The name faded from shortly after the time the [[Michigan State Highway Department]] (MSHD){{#tag:ref|The Michigan State Highway Department was reorganized into the Michigan Department of State Highways and Transportation on August 23, 1973,<ref name=MMM27>[[#Kulsea|Kulsea]], p. 27.</ref> and the name was later shortened to its current form in 1978.<ref name=MMM30-1>[[#Kulsea|Kulsea]], pp. 30<U+2013>1.</ref>|group=lower-alpha}} assigned the first highway numbers in the state.<ref name=barnett213>[[#Barnett|Barnett]], p.&nbsp;213</ref>

The first state highways along the US&nbsp;23 corridor were numbered [[M-65 (Michigan highway)|M-65]] from the Ohio line north to the Flint area and [[M-10 (Michigan highway)|M-10]] from Flint north to Mackinaw City by July 1, 1919.<ref name=MSHD19LP>{{cite map |publisher= [[Michigan State Highway Department]] |title=State of Michigan: Lower Peninsula |date= July 1, 1919 |cartography= MSHD }}</ref>{{#tag:ref|The first state highways in Michigan were signed in 1919.<ref name=press-1919-09-20>{{cite news |title=Michigan May Do Well Following Wisconsin's Road Marking System |work=[[The Grand Rapids Press]] |date= September 20, 1919 |page= 10 |oclc= 9975013}}</ref>|name=name|group=lower-alpha}} When originally designated, M-65 was in two sections: the southern segment ran from the Ohio state line north to the Dundee area; the northern section ran between Ann Arbor and Flint by way of Brighton and Fenton.<ref name="MSHD19LP">{{cite map |publisher=Michigan State Highway Department |title=State of Michigan: Lower Peninsula |date= July 1, 1919 |cartography= MSHD }}</ref> The gap between the two segments was eliminated by the middle of 1926.<ref name=MSHD26-09>{{cite map |publisher=Michigan State Highway Department |title=Official Highway Service Map |year=September 1, 1926 |cartography= MSHD }}</ref>

===United States Numbered Highways===
US&nbsp;23 was commissioned on November 11, 1926,<ref name=USH/> with the debut of the United States Numbered Highway System.<ref name=USHM>{{cite map| publisher= [[Bureau of Public Roads]] |title=United States System of Highways |url=http://www.okladot.state.ok.us/hqdiv/p-r-div/maps/misc-maps/1926us.pdf |date= November 11, 1926 |oclc= 32889555 |cartography= American Association of State Highway Officials |accessdate=May 10, 2008 |format=PDF}}</ref> The MSHD removed the M-10 and M-65 designations from the highway at the time. As it was originally designated, US&nbsp;23 crossed into Michigan from Ohio south of [[Temperance, Michigan|Temperance]] and ran north to [[Ypsilanti, Michigan|Ypsilanti]] via [[Maybee, Michigan|Maybee]]. Once the highway entered Ann Arbor, it followed the roads that preceded the modern freeway up to Flint. From Flint to Saginaw, US&nbsp;23 ran concurrently with US&nbsp;10. On the way north to Bay City, the highway ran on the west side of the Saginaw River before turning north to the Standish area.

==Memorial highway designations and tourist routes==
Most of US&nbsp;23, along with [[U.S. Route 2 in Michigan|US&nbsp;2]] in the [[Upper Peninsula of Michigan|Upper Peninsula]], has been designated the United Spanish War Veterans Memorial Highway. The designation was conferred in Public Act 207 of 1945, with companion legislation for US&nbsp;2 in 1949. Signs marking the highway were not erected until 1968 when Governor [[George W. Romney]] had them installed.<ref name=barnett216-7>[[#Barnett|Barnett]], pp.&nbsp;216<U+2013>7.</ref>

North of Standish, US&nbsp;23 is a part of the [[Lake Huron Circle Tour]] (LHCT).<ref name="MDOT10"/> This tour was created in May 1986 as part of the overall Great Lakes Circle Tour through a joint effort between MDOT and its counterparts in [[Wisconsin Department of Transportation|Wisconsin]], [[Minnesota Department of Transportation|Minnesota]] and [[Ministry of Transportation (Ontario)|Ontario]].<ref name=davis1986-05-01>{{cite news |last= Davis |first= R.

When the [[Michigan State Legislature]] consolidated the statutes defining the various memorial highways in 2001, they included the Veterans of World War I Memorial Highway in the law. Defined along I-75/US&nbsp;23 between Saginaw and Bay City, the designation was included in Public Act 142.<ref name=barnett229>[[#Barnett|Barnett]], p.&nbsp;229.</ref> That act also affected another previously designated moniker between the two cities. The Roberts-Linton Highway was named in 1931 for local leaders who championed the construction of a highway along the [[Saginaw River]].

The second bridge is the [[Cheboygan Bascule Bridge]] in Cheboygan. This [[bascule bridge]] was built in 1940 over the Cheboygan River as the last of its kind before [[World War II]]. It was built as a "two-leaf bridge in a place where a single-leaf bridge probably would have sufficed."<ref name=friday/> The initial construction of the structure was delayed when the contractor died, but it was completed in December 1940.
