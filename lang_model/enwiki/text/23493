'''Angus McKinnon Young''' (born on [[31 March]], [[1955]]) is the lead guitarist, songwriter, and co-founder of the Australian [[hard rock]] band [[AC/DC]].  He is known for his wild, energetic performance style and schoolboy-uniform stage outfits. He was ranked 96th on [[Rolling Stone]]'s list of the "''100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time''"<ref>[http://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/5937559/the_100_greatest_guitarists_of_all_time 100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time]</ref>.

==Biography==
Angus Young, one of nine children of William and Margaret Young, was brought up in [[Sydney]], Australia with his older brothers [[Malcolm Young|Malcolm]], [[George Young (rock musician)|George]], [[Alexander Young (musician)|Alex]], who all became musicians, an elder sister Margaret, and four other siblings. Angus started playing [[guitar]] when he was five years old <U+2014> a local child had one and Angus would play it during visits. He got his own guitar by taking a [[banjo]] his family had lying around the house and re-stringing it like a guitar. 

===Early years===
Young did not get into guitar-playing seriously until after the Young family moved from [[Scotland]] to [[Australia]] in 1963. He bought a [[Gibson SG]], after seeing it in a friend's catalogue. Until then, he had been playing on an old [[H<U+00F6>fner]] guitar he inherited from his brother Malcolm, due to the fact that although guitars were available, they were expensive because they were from [[United States|America]].{{Fact|date=February 2007}} Angus's brother George (of [[The Easybeats]]) gave both Angus and Malcolm guitar lessons when he would come home during breaks from touring. 

Prior to forming AC/DC, Young played in a local group called '''Kantuckee'''.  Kantuckee's lineup included Bob McGlynn (vocals), Angus Young (guitar), Jon Stevens (bass) & Trevor James (drums). This was the first band to record Demo takes for [[Stevie Wright]]s classic "[[Evie (song)|Evie]]" at the request of George Young. The band split and was later called Tantrum  with the following line up: Mark Sneddon (vocals-guitar), Angus Young (guitar), Jon Stevens (bass) and Trevor James (drums)<ref>{{cite web | title=IMDb | work=IMDb.com |url=http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0949264/bio}}</ref>

===Formation of AC/DC===
Angus and Malcolm Young formed AC/DC in 1973. The first line up included Angus Young on lead guitar, Malcolm Young on [[rhythm guitar]], [[Colin Burgess]] on [[drum kit|drums]], [[Larry Van Kriedt]] on [[bass guitar]] and [[Dave Evans (singer)|Dave Evans]] on vocals. The band's first single was "Can I Sit Next To You", which was later re-recorded with [[Bon Scott]] as their vocalist, as "Can I Sit Next To You Girl".   They got the name AC/DC after seeing the letters "AC/DC" on the back of a sewing machine owned by their sister, Margaret. "AC/DC" stands for Alternating Current/Direct Current.

After playing with the band for a while, Young developed his trademark schoolboy image. Before settling on the schoolboy costume, Angus had tried other costumes, such as [[Spider-man]], [[Zorro]], a [[gorilla]], and a parody of [[Superman]], named Super-Ang.<ref name="cwalker">{{cite book | title=Highway to Hell: The Life and Times of AC/DC Legend Bon Scott | year=2001 | id=ISBN 1-891-24113-3 | author=Walker, Clinton | pages=pp. 128-133}}</ref>  The schoolboy costume became a signature trademark of Young. To match this image the press and public were told that Young was born in 1959, not 1955. The original uniform was reputedly from his secondary school, [[Ashfield Boys High School]] in Sydney. One rumour is that he did not have time to change his clothes between school and band practice, and simply wore the uniform; while such an event may have occurred years earlier, by 1973, Angus had long left school. His sister Margaret suggested he wear the uniform after Malcolm asked each band member to come up with their own gimmick, which was ironic as Angus very much disliked being at school. This was the era of [[glam rock]], when costumes were common for pop and rock acts.

===Recent events===

Although Young prefers to keep his private life out of the media, it is known that he now lives in [[Sydney]], [[Australia]] and also has a home in [[Aalten]], [[Netherlands]] (because he has a home in the Netherlands, he is also on the Quote 500, the list of Holland's 500 richest people). Young married his Dutch wife, Ellen, in 1980 shortly before [[Bon Scott]] died.<ref>{{cite web | title=The Daily Telegraph | work=AC/DC Stars Mega Mansion |url=http://www.news.com.au/sundaytelegraph/story/0,22049,21164917-5001026,00.html}}</ref>

On August 24, 2006, Young received ''[[Kerrang!]]'' magazine's Legend Award from the editor, Paul Brannigan. Brannigan called AC/DC "one of the most important and influential rock bands in history."<ref>[http://arts.guardian.co.uk/news/story/0,,1858016,00.html Lostprophets on their metal as they top the Kerrang! awards | | Guardian Unlimited Arts<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>.

==Equipment==
===Guitars===
Angus Young has used [[Gibson SG]]s in various forms (his original, and the basis for his current signature model, was a 1968 SG) throughout his career. He is rarely seen with another guitar. However, he also owns [[Telecaster]]s, [[Gibson Firebird]]s and [[ES335]]s. When AC/DC played a jam of "Rock me Baby" with the [[Rolling Stones]] in 2003, he played a Gibson ES-335 borrowed from [[Keith Richards]], perhaps one of the only times he was without an SG onstage. Young's 1968 SG has T Top pickups. Another 1964 SG that he used on the recording of Ballbreaker, has patent # pickups. All of these are high output [[Alnico]] 2 pickups with matched coils. Angus has used Ernie Ball Slinky RPS strings for over 40 years, gauge .9-.42 or .10-.048  <ref>{{cite web | title=Get That Tone: Angus Young | work=gibson.com |url=http://www.gibson.com/en-us/Lifestyle/Features/Get%20That%20Tone_%20Angus%20Young/}}</ref>

===Angus Young Signature SG===
Angus Young and [[Gibson Guitar Corporation]] have collaborated to make the Angus Young Signature SG, which is special in several ways. <ref>[http://www.gibson.com/en%2Dus/Divisions/Gibson%20USA/Guitars/SG%20Specials/Angus%20Young%20Signature/ Angus Young Signature SG]</ref>

The model features a pickup designed by Young himself (the Angus Young Signature Humbucker) in the bridge position, and a '57 Classic [[Humbucker]] in the neck. The headstock features Young's famous "Devil Schoolboy!" engraved picture, and the tremolo bar features Angus' name instead of the Gibson logo. The guitar has a rosewood fingerboard, trapezoid fret inlays, a signature black pickguard, 22 frets, a worn cherry finish, and nickel hardware. The volume and tone knobs are bigger than those of a regular SG but it still features the standard 3-way selector switch.

===Amplifiers===
Young's amps have been plexi [[Marshall amplifiers|Marshalls]]: JTM45s, JTM50s, JMP50s and Superleads (plus a few [[Wizard amplifiers]]). His main amp is his JTM45, which he uses both live and in the studio. When Young plays live, he runs this through an isolation speaker box that sits under the stage and feeds directly into the PA system. In the studio, Angus has often used a 100w plexi for riffs and a smaller plexi (jmp50, jtm50, or jtm45) for solos.
Speaker cabinets he has used have been Marshall 4x12"s (model 1982 and 1960, mostly B models) with Celestion G12H 30 watt (on old recordings), Vintage 30s (on newer recordings) and G12M 25 watt speakers (on solos/overdubs on newer recordings). Malcolm has used [[Mesa Boogie]] Cabs before as seen on AC/DC's 1992 live album, ''[[Live (AC/DC album)|Live]]''.
Angus is said to, by Marshall, use the 1987X 50watt head.

==Influence==
Angus Young's energetic guitar style has been an influence on many young [[hard rock]] guitarists. His work with AC/DC has been an influence on bands ranging from [[Guns N' Roses]] and [[Def Leppard]] to newer artists like [[Disturbed]], [[Jet (band)|Jet]] and [[You Am I]].{{Fact|date=February 2007}} Young cites his own influences as [[Chuck Berry]], [[Muddy Waters]], [[Leslie West]], and other [[blues]]/[[rock and roll]] players.<ref>{{cite web | title=Angus Young influences | work=AllMusic.com|url=http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=11:ag77gjqr86in~T1}}</ref>

==Style==
Angus Young's playing style is very straight blues, playing in both the minor and major [[pentatonic]] [[blues scale]]. His style is spiced by additional non-blues tricks. In AC/DC's earlier recordings, [[power chords]] can be heard in songs such as "[[T.N.T. (song)|T.N.T.]]" and "[[It's a Long Way to the Top (If You Wanna Rock 'n' Roll)]]". He also utilises touches of Scottish folk in his playing, and pull-off [[arpeggio]]s (pull-offs, played one-handed) are a popular trick, appearing in songs such as "[[Who Made Who (song)|Who Made Who]]",  "[[Dirty Deeds Done Dirt Cheap (song)|Dirty Deeds Done Dirt Cheap]]", "[[Sin City]]" and "[[Let There Be Rock]]" (live). In 1976, the band recorded an instrumental arrangement of the Scottish traditional song "[[The Bonnie Banks o' Loch Lomond|Loch Lomond]]", retitled "[[Fling Thing]]", which has appeared in their stage act over the years. The title refers to the [[Highland Fling]].

He is especially noted for his vibrato, his intricate improvisation in live shows, and his stripped down approach to the guitar, with regard to amp-provided effects and guitar accessories.

He often receives criticism from the music press, many of his critics stating that AC/DC's songs sound too similar, focusing on the same handful of chords. However, as Young stated in an interview with the Atlanta Gazette in 1979:

"It's just rock and roll. A lot of times we get criticised for it. A lot of music papers come out with: 'When are they going to stop playing these three chords?' If you believe you shouldn't play just three chords it's pretty silly on their part. To us, the simpler a song is, the better, 'cause it's more in line with what the person on the street is."

===Stage antics===
Angus Young is notorious for his wild onstage antics. He entertains audiences with his intense jumps onstage and with his running back and forth across the stage while playing his guitar. Young would clamber on to Bon Scott's shoulders during concerts and they would make their way through the audience with smoke streaming from a satchel on his back, while he played an extended guitar solo, usually during the song "[[Rocker (song)|Rocker]]".  Once, at a concert in Donington, he rode on Brian Johnson's shoulders. In some of his concert videos, he would raise his foot and bring it back down to the front of his other foot like a zig-zag on stage while keeping the same rhythm on the guitar as he played.

[[Image:AngusYoungAndCampino-2001-06-05.jpg|thumb|160px|right|Angus (left) performing his [[Devil]] Horns act, along with [[Andreas Frege|Campino]] (right), lead singer of [[Germany|German]] [[Punk rock]] band [[Die Toten Hosen]].]]

In later years, Young performed moves such as his own version of the [[Duck Walk]], which was inspired by his idol [[Chuck Berry]], and his "[[spasm]]", during which he throws himself to the ground, kicking, shaking, and spinning in circles, while playing the guitar. Both moves can be seen on various videos, such as "[[Live (AC/DC album)|Live At Donington]]". <ref>[http://www.mtv.com/bands/az/acdc/artist.jhtml AC/DC | Music Artist | Videos, News, Photos & Ringtones | MTV<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Young developed the "spasm" while he was playing live in a small club in Australia, after he accidentally tripped over a cable on stage while playing his solo. He covered it up by having a seizure-like "spasm" on stage to make it seem like part of the act. It has been a trademark of his ever since. 

Angus Young also performs "the bob". In the bob, he headbangs while tapping his feet. He taps his right foot twice when headbanging up, and his left foot twice when headbanging down. The bob is found in every live performance AC/DC ever performed.

Other gimmicks employed by Young include his strip act, which can be seen during "Bad Boy Boogie" on the most definitive live concert footage ''[[AC/DC: Let There Be Rock (movie)|Let There Be Rock]]'' (1980). It is also viewable in during "[[Jailbreak (AC/DC song)|Jailbreak]]" on the 1991 ''[[Live (AC/DC album)|Live at Donington]]'' [[DVD]], during "Boogie Man" on ''[[No Bull]]'', and during "Bad Boy Boogie" on ''[[Stiff Upper Lip|Stiff Upper Lip Live]]''. And sometimes when he "strips" he will pull down his pants...revealing his undergarments, then pulls them up and moons the crowd. Sometimes he would use his fingers to perform his [[devil]] horns act -- usually before playing "[[Highway to Hell (song)|Highway to Hell]]" or "[[Hell Ain't a Bad Place to Be]]" - whether being on stage or having his picture taken by the press.
