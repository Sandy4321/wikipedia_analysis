[[File:Supreme Court-Pakistan.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Supreme Court of Pakistan]]
The '''Supreme Court of Pakistan (SCOP)''' ([[Urdu language|Urdu:]] '''<U+0639><U+062F><U+0627><U+0644><U+062A> <U+0639><U+0638><U+0645><U+06CC><U+0670> <U+067E><U+0627><U+06A9><U+0633><U+062A><U+0627><U+0646>'''; ''Ad<U+0101>lat-e-Uzma P<U+0101>kist<U+0101>n'') is the [[apex court]] in the [[:Category:Court system of Pakistan|judicial hierarchy]] of [[Pakistan]], the final arbiter of legal and constitutional disputes. The Supreme Court has a permanent seat in [[Islamabad]]. It also has a number of Branch Registries where cases are heard. The court has a number of ''[[de jure]]'' powers, outlined in the [[Constitution of Pakistan|Constitution]]. Through several periods of [[Military coups in Pakistan|military rule]] and constitutional suspensions (see [[Doctrine of necessity]]), the court has also established itself as a ''de facto'' check on [[Pakistan Armed Forces|military power]].

It has the [[appellate jurisdiction]] over all [[Court system of Pakistan|high courts]] (including provincial [[High Courts of Pakistan|high courts]], [[District Courts of Pakistan|district courts]], and [[Anti Terrorism Court of Pakistan|special courts]]) and [[Federal Shariat Court of Pakistan|federal courts]], as well as [[original jurisdiction]] over a few types of cases. The Supreme Court is made up of a [[Chief Justice of Pakistan|chief justice]] and a number of [[List of Justices of the Supreme Court of Pakistan|senior justices]] who are nominated by the [[President of Pakistan|President]] after consulting the [[Prime minister of Pakistan|Prime minister]]. Once appointed justices are expected to complete a designated term and then retire, unless they are removed by the [[Supreme Judicial Council of Pakistan|Supreme Judicial Council]] after receiving a presidential reference regarding misconduct of judge(s).

==Constitutional Authority==
Part VII, Chapter 2 of the [[Constitution of Pakistan|Constitution]] (articles 176 through 191) deals with the powers, composition, rules, and responsibilities of the Supreme Court.

These articles concern:
* Article 176 <U+2013> composition of the Court
* Article 177 <U+2013> appointment and qualifications of the Chief Justice
* Article 178 <U+2013> oath of office
* Article 179 <U+2013> retirement
* Article 180 <U+2013> vacancy, absence, or inability of the Chief Justice
* Article 181 <U+2013> vacancy, absence, or inability of other justices
* Article 182 <U+2013> ad hoc justices
* Article 183 <U+2013> location of Court
* Article 184 <U+2013> jurisdiction in a dispute between two or more governments
* Article 185 <U+2013> jurisdiction to hear and determine appeals
* Article 186 <U+2013> if requested, advise the President on important matters of law
* Article 186A <U+2013> authority to transfer venue
* Article 187 <U+2013> orders and subpoenas
* Article 188 <U+2013> power to review its own judgements and orders
* Article 189 <U+2013> binding nature of Supreme Court's decisions on all other Pakistani Courts
* Article 190 <U+2013> all executive and judicial authorities in Pakistan bound to aid the Supreme Court

In addition to these articles, the Constitution also makes numerous references to the Supreme Court in other chapters and sections.  An important function of the judiciary branch is to provide [[checks and balances]] to the power of the other branches of government.

The Supreme Court under [[Pervez Musharraf]] is an exception to this rule of constitutional authority.  That court took oath not under the constitution of Pakistan but under a military [[Legal Framework Order, 2002|Legal Framework Order]].

===De jure power===
{{Supreme Court of Pakistan}}

''[[De jure]]'' power refers to powers that a court has under the law, though they may not be carried out or have full effect in practice.  The Supreme Court of Pakistan has the explicit ''de jure'' power to block the exercise of certain Presidential [[reserve powers]]. For example, under Part III of the Chapter II: Federation of Pakistan, Article 58 the [[President of Pakistan|President]] may dismiss the [[National Assembly of Pakistan|National Assembly]] (triggering new elections), but the dismissal is subject to Supreme Court approval.  The Court also has the power to overturn presidential orders and parliamentary legislation by declaring such orders or laws to be unconstitutional.

In another example of a ''de jure power'' granted to the Court, article 17 of the Constitution states:

{{quote|text=Every citizen, not being in the service of (State of) Pakistan, ''shall'' have the right to form or be a member of a political party, subject to any reasonable restrictions imposed by law in the interest of the sovereignty or integrity of Pakistan and such law shall provide that where the [[Government of Pakistan|Government]] declare that any political party has been formed or is operating in a manner prejudicial to the sovereignty or integrity of Pakistan, the Federal Government shall, within fifteen days of such declaration, refer the matter to the Supreme Court whose decision on such reference ''shall'' be final.|sign=Article 17:Freedom of association; Chapter I: Fundamental Rights and Principles|source=[[Constitution of Pakistan]], <small>Chapter source</small><ref>{{cite web|title=Part II:Chapter I: Fundamental Rights (Article 17: Freedom of association) |url=http://www.pakistani.org/pakistan/constitution/part2.ch1.html|work=Constitution of Pakistan|publisher=pakistani.org|accessdate=20 June 2012}}</ref> }}

The Supreme Court thus provides, in principle, an important safeguard against the abuse of laws that could potentially have politically repressive consequences.

===''De facto'' power===
The ''de jure'' powers of the court as outlined in the Constitution can only be understood in the context of Pakistan's political history, during which the armed forces has seized power, declared [[martial law]] and suspended the constitution. Despite the military interventions in the government, the court has maintained its institutional integrity and has been able to maintain its authority to some degree in the face of military rule. Since in 1970, Bengali Chief Justice [[Hamoodur Rahman|Hamoodor Rahman]] published the reports of [[Hamoodur Rahman Commission]], formed to investigate the failure and fall of [[East Pakistan|East-Pakistan]]. The ''de facto'' powers of the Supreme Court increased immensely thereafter.

In 1977 the Supreme Court legitimized the [[1977 Pakistani coup d'<U+00E9>tat]] (see [[Operation Fair Play]]). On 8 March 1978 the Supreme Court upheld the death sentence of former prime minister [[Zulfikar Ali Bhutto]], who was executed on 4 April 1979 by the orders of Supreme Court. On 12 October 1999 however, the Supreme Court ordered that chairman joint chiefs General Pervez Musharraf could only allow military rule to remain in place for three years. The supreme court began hearing the corruption cases and hijacking controversy against former prime minister [[Nawaz Sharif]], and found him guilty after sentencing him life imprisonment in a short trial. As a result, Musharraf held a national referendum on 30 April 2002, followed by general elections on October 2002<U+2014> a move that substantially validated the return of democracy. The supreme court supervised the [[Pakistani general election, 2002|2002 general elections]] and successfully oversaw the transition of powers to President to prime minister of Pakistan. The political powers of supreme court were further extended and solidified its political position in 2004 when [[Shaukat Aziz]] became prime minister.<ref name="Cambridge University Press, 2012">{{cite book|last=Halliday|first=Terrence C.|title=Fates of Political Liberalism in Post-British Colony: Pakistan|year=2012|publisher=Cambridge University Press, 2012|isbn=978-1-107-01278-3|pages=350<U+2013>351|url=http://books.google.com/?id=3j4JtL4b3ggC&pg=PA348&dq=Shaukat+Aziz+Finance+minister#v=onepage&q=Shaukat%20Aziz%20Finance%20minister&f=true|edition=1|author2=Lucien Karpik |editor=Malcolm M.

Despite its controversial rulings, the Supreme Court has the strong support of the people and the elite and is one of the most respected institutions in the nation. Even during military rule, when the Court might have been expected to be subject to a supra-constitutional dispensation, it has used its institutional authority to maintain some influence over political events.

==Court Composition==
Unless the President records written reasons for deviating from this rule, justices retire at age sixty five.{{expand section|date=May 2012}}

===PCO 1999 (General Pervez Musharraf First Martial Law)===
The second PCO in the history of Pakistan was declared by General Pervez Musharraf on 14 October 1999.<ref name="Kalhan - Constitution and Extraconstitution">{{cite journal|last=Kalhan|first=Anil|title=Constitution and 'Extraconstitution': Emergency Powers in Postcolonial Pakistan and India|journal=Emergency Powers in Asia (Victor Ramraj & Arun Thiruvengadam, eds.)|year=2010|url=http://ssrn.com/abstract=1398545}}</ref> When the PCO was proclaimed, at first the judiciary was not asked to take an oath.{{clarify|date=May 2012}} On 26 January 2000 Musharraf issued an order "Oath of Office (Judges) Order, 2000" that required the judiciary to take oath of office under the PCO. 
The then Chief Justice [[Saeeduzzaman Siddiqui]] and 5 other judges of the Supreme Court refused to take any oath in contravention to the oath they took under the 1973 Constitution, when they became judges. Majority of the judges had more than 3 years remaining in their office. Refusing to take oath deprived them from continuing as judges, which was later termed as un-constitutional move by General Musharraf.

{{See also|2007 Pakistani state of emergency#Supreme Court Action|l1=State of Emergency in Pakistan 2007}}

==The attack on the Supreme Court in 1997==
Following the establishment of [[Morgan Freeman Court of Pakistan|Anti Terrorism Courts]] and the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of Pakistan|Fourteenth Amendment]] in November 1997, legislators from different parties brought the matter before the Supreme Court under Chief Justice [[Sajad Ali Shah]]. [[Nawaz Sharif]], [[Prime minister of Pakistan|Prime minister]] at that time, harshly criticized the Chief Justice during the proceedings and was found in contempt.

On 30 November 1997, Sharif appeared before the Supreme Court along with party workers, members, chief ministers, and constituents to hear the proceedings. Unruly party workers stormed into the Supreme Court, forcing Chief Justice Sajjad Ali Shah to remove the finding of contempt against Sharif. Hundreds of [[PML-N]] supporters and members of its youth wing, the Muslim Students Front (MSF), breached the police barrier around the courthouse when defence lawyer S.M. Zafar was arguing Sharif's case.

A journalist rushed into the courtroom and warned the bench of an impending attack. The Chief Justice rose abruptly, thanked Zafar and adjourned the hearing. The justices quickly left the courtroom but workers were able to enter, shouting slogans and damaging furniture.

The mob, led by ruling Punjabi party member Sardar Naseem and the retired Colonel Mushtaq Tahir Kheli, Sharif's political secretary, chanted slogans against the Chief Justice. Famous PTV anchor Tariq Aziz threw and broke the portrait of the founder of Pakistan, Quaid-e-Azam Muhammad Ali Jinnah. The mob also attacked Pakistan Peoples Party senator Iqbal Haider. Police eventually managed to restore normalcy using batons and tear gas both inside and outside the courthouse, but the court could only proceed for about 45 minutes.

==The Supreme Court under Musharraf==
Shortly after General Musharraf overthrew Sharif in the [[1999 Pakistani coup d'<U+00E9>tat]], the opposition challenged the legitimacy of the coup and asked the court to rule on its legality.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/south_asia/532550.stm Military takeover challenged in court], [[BBC]], 22 November 1999</ref> On 12 May 2000 the
Court rendered a nuanced verdict.<ref name="Kalhan - Constitution and Extraconstitution" /><ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/south_asia/746262.stm Pakistan court limits army rule], [[BBC]]</ref> 
*In its preamble, the Court
**rejected the options of "complete surrender" to the regime or total opposition which, in its judgement, would have led to the "closure of the courts". It chose a middle ground (praised by retired US judge [[John Clifford Wallace]]) that allowed the Court to maximize its influence.
**asserted that it had the inherent power to examine the validity of Musharraf's orders, even orders purportedly restraining the Court from questioning his proclamations.
**called Musharraf's coup an "extra-constitutional action".
*In its judgement, however, the Court
**accepted the coup on the grounds of
***the doctrine of state [[Necessity]] (a situation having arisen for which "there was no remedy provided in the Constitution", [[checks and balances]] such as Article 58(2)(b) having been removed by the [[Thirteenth Amendment to the Constitution of Pakistan|Thirteenth Amendment]], hence ''Necessitas facit licitum quod alias non est licitum'').
***the principle of ''[[salus populi est suprema lex]]''.
***the principle "that the government should be by the [[consent of the governed]], whether voters or not" (the court took note of the fact that the takeover was widely welcomed, and little-protested, and hence that the regime had the implied consent of the governed).
**asserted the right of the Superior Courts to review the orders, proceedings, acts, and legislative measures of the Musharraf regime.
**termed the situation a "case of constitutional deviation for a transitional period".
**accepted the government's argument that the electoral rolls were outdated and that fresh elections could not be held without updating the electoral rolls, and that two years were required to do so.
**gave Musharraf until 12 May 2002 to hold elections.
**reserved for itself the right to review/re-examine the continuation of Musharraf's emergency powers.

Although the government, before this judgement, had not given a timetable for the restoration of democracy <U+2013> having argued that it needed an indefinite and possibly prolonged time to reform the country <U+2013> Musharraf publicly submitted to the Court's judgement.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/south_asia/763880.stm |title=SOUTH ASIA &#124; Musharraf pledges return to democracy |publisher=BBC News  |date=25 May 2000 |accessdate=2009-11-09}}</ref>
The [[Pakistani general election, 2002|elections]] were duly held in October 2002 as ordered and the Constitution was revived. However, Musharraf later decided to retain power and enacted the [[Seventeenth Amendment to the Constitution of Pakistan|Seventeenth Amendment]] in December 2003, largely incorporating the 2002 [[Legal Framework Order, 2002|Legal Framework Order]] into the Constitution.<ref name="Kalhan - Constitution and Extraconstitution" />

Pakistani [[legal theory|legal theorists]] {{Who|date=November 2008}} have posited that Pakistan's "''[[grundnorm]]''", the basis for its [[constitutional convention (political custom)|Constitutional convention]] and system of laws, continues in effect (and the Supreme Court therefore retains its authority) even when the written constitution is suspended by the imposition of a military [[dictablanda]].

===Reference against Chief Justice===
On 9 March 2007 a presidential reference was served to the Chief Justice, [[Iftikhar Muhammad Chaudhry]], attempting to suspend him. The government ordered him to go on compulsory leave, but on 20 July 2007 the Supreme Court unanimously overturned the compulsory leave order and by a 10<U+2013>13 majority also ordered Chaudhry reinstated as Chief Justice.<ref name="Kalhan - Constitution and Extraconstitution" />

The Court nonetheless ruled that the Provisional Order 27 of 1970, which removed executive power to suspend judges, was unconstitutional.[http://www.supremecourt.gov.pk/sub_links/pr-1/Chief%20Justice%20Press%20Release.htm  Text of Supreme Court Order]

===State of Emergency===
Immediately following the imposition of the [[2007 Pakistani state of emergency|state of emergency]] on 3 November 2007, the Chief Justice [[Iftikhar Muhammad Chaudhry]] was removed from the Supreme Court and arrested by troops of the 111th brigade of [[Pakistan Army]] sent by General Musharraf (who resigned in August 2008 under [[Movement to impeach Pervez Musharraf|impeachment pressures]]).

Until the state of emergency was declared, Justices of the Supreme Court were:

===Sex Scandal involving Supreme Court Justices===
According to [[The Times]], the justices who pledged allegiance to Musharraf had earlier been caught engaging in sexual acts with prostitutes. The article alleged that photographs of the judges engaging in sexual acts were used to blackmail the judges to take the oath of allegiance and make rulings favorable to the military.<ref>[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/asia/article2848490.ece Sex Scandal involving Supreme Court Judges.] Ghulam Hasnain, reporting from Islamabad for [[The Times]], 11 November 2007.

===Supreme Court composition under Musharraf  after 3 November 2007===
The Supreme Court of Pakistan consisted of the following justices who took the [[Provisional Constitutional Order]] (PCO) of 3 November 2007:

* Hon. Chief Justice Mr. Justice [[Abdul Hameed Dogar]]
* Hon. Justice Muhammad Nawaz Abbasi
*              Faqir Muhammad Khokhar
* Hon. Justice M. Javed Buttar
* Hon. Justice Saiyed Saeed Ashhad.
* Hon. Justice Ijaz-ul-Hassan
* Hon. Justice Muhammad Qaim Jan Khan
* Hon. Justice Mohammad Moosa K. Legari
* Hon. Justice Ch. Ejaz Yousaf
* Hon. Justice Muhammad Akhtar Shabbir
* Hon. Justice Zia Perwez
* Hon. Justice Mian Hamid Farooq
* Hon. Justice Syed Sakhi Hussain Bokhari
* Hon. Justice Syed Zawwar Hussain Jaffery
* Hon. Justice Sheikh Hakim Ali (Took PCO Oath to Lahore High Court, elevated to Supreme Court on 8 February 2008)

Justice [[Abdul Hameed Dogar]] took the oath of Chief Justice even after a 7-member Supreme Court that included Chief Justice [[Iftikhar Muhammad Chaudhry]] nullified the imposition of emergency, suspension of constitution, and PCO. The Court instructed the justices not to take oath under the PCO, and all military personnel not to obey any illegal orders.<ref>[http://archives.djuice.pk/2007/11/04/golden-historic-decision-by-supreme-court-of-pakistan/ golden-historic-decision-by-supreme-court-of-pakistan/] Order of the Supreme Court of Pakistan 3 November 2007.</ref>

On 15 February 2008 the Supreme Court delivered a detailed judgement to validate the Proclamation of Emergency on 3 November 2007, the Provisional Constitution Order No. 1 of 2007 and the Oath of Office (Judges) Order, 2007.<ref name="Kalhan - Constitution and Extraconstitution" />  This judgement was made by the full court and written by Chief Justice Abdul Hameed Dogar. According to the judgement, "The learned Chief Justices and Judges of the superior courts, (Supreme Court of Pakistan, Federal Shariat Court and the High Courts), who have not been given, and who have not made, oath under the Oath of Office (Judges) Order, 2007 have ceased to hold their respective offices on the 3rd of November 2007. Their cases cannot be re-opened being hit by the doctrine of past and closed transaction".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.brecorder.com/index.php?id=694527&currPageNo=1&query=&search=&term=&supDate= |title=Business Recorder [Pakistan's First Financial Daily&#93; |publisher=Brecorder.com |accessdate=2009-11-09}}</ref>

==Recent events==

===Restoration of Judges===
On 15 March 2009 a two-year-old lawyers' movement working for restoration of the judiciary as it existed prior to the state of emergency called for a long march and a sit-in in Islamabad. Before the procession could reach Islamabad, the Prime Minister [[Yousuf Raza Gilani]] appeared on national television and announced unconditional restoration of the judiciary. On 17 March 2009 the formal official notification for restoration of the judiciary was issued. As the result of the notification, all judges who had not retired due to age limit and had not re-taken oath were restored back. Justice Javaid Iqbal, Justice Ijaz Ahmed, Justice Khalil-ur-Rehman Ramday and Justice Raja Fayyaz Ahmed were restored to their position as of 2 November 2007 with immediate effect. Justice Iftikhar Mohammad Chaudhry was notified to re-assume his office on 22 March 2009. Justice Rana Bhagwandas and Justice Falak Sher had since retired.<ref name="Kalhan - Gray Zone Constitutionalism">{{cite journal|last=Kalhan|first=Anil|title="Gray Zone" Constitutionalism and the Dilemma of Judicial Independence in Pakistan|journal=Vanderbilt Journal of Transnational Law|date=January 2013|volume=46|page=1|url=http://ssrn.com/abstract=2087116}}</ref>

===Long March Controversy===
General Ashfaq P. Kayani, the Chief of Army Staff, also had an important role by silently intervening and encouraging a rapprochement between the government and the opposition.  Neither side acknowledged this role, however, until lawyers' movement leader Aitezaz Ahsan publicly admitted Kayani's role. There were rumours that protestors and law enforcement would have violently collided otherwise had he not intervened.<ref name="Kalhan - Gray Zone Constitutionalism" />

===Independence of the judiciary===
The restoration of the judges resulted from immense public pressure and led the judiciary to begin a quest for independence. The goal was to ensure a strong and efficient judicial system that could quickly deliver justice to the public. The Supreme Court took notice of several important constitutional and other matters in this period that related to the public interest. These matters included the constitutional petition on PCO judges to declare the 3 November 2007 actions null and void and the constitutional petition on the national reconciliation ordinance (NRO) to declare it null and void. The Supreme Court has also been vigilant on corruption cases related to the current ruling elite, acting in cases such as the Hajj scam, rental power projects, steel mills of Pakistan, and National Insurance Corporation Limited (NICL). This judicial activism and the slowing of government productivity without corruption has created a tension between the judiciary and other government branches.<ref name="Kalhan - Gray Zone Constitutionalism" />

===Constitutional petitions No. 8 and 9 of 2009===
Of the 14 justices that rendered a verdict related to taking an oath under the PCO, 12 had taken the oath themselves. However, they controversially did not apply the judgement to themselves.

====Controversial aspect of the decision====
The decision of the Court summarily removed all justices of the higher judiciary who were not part of it as of 2 November 2007. Their removal was ordered on the grounds that the ''de jure'' Chief Justice was not allowed to advise in these cases. In the same decision the court held that the ''de jure'' Chief Justice from 3 November 2007 to 22 March 2009 was Justice Chaudhry.<ref name="Kalhan - Gray Zone Constitutionalism" />

There were three groups of removed justices:
* Those elevated to higher courts who initially took oath under the PCO
* Those who were elevated to higher courts after restoration of the Constitution and were appointed by Musharraf
* Those who were elevated to higher courts after restoration of the Constitution and were appointed by [[Asif Ali Zardari]]

The Supreme Court bench that rendered the decision consisted entirely of justices who had taken oath under the PCO of 1999 themselves, but were already sitting justices of the higher judiciary at the time and had taken a constitutional oath. The 1999 PCO and decisions made under it were given constitutional protection by [[Seventeenth Amendment to the Constitution of Pakistan|Seventeenth amendment]].<ref name="Kalhan - Gray Zone Constitutionalism" />

This decision has resulted in situations where:
# newly appointed justices who never took any sort of oath under any PCO have been removed
# sitting justices who took an oath under the 2007 PCO are still acting as justices, though their cases will be sent to Supreme Judicial Council
# sitting justices who were reappointed and took oath under Justice Dogar are still acting as justices with no action
# justices who took oath under the PCO of 1999 are still functioning as justices of higher judiciary

Critics of the decision question the fact that some PCO judges are still working and some non-PCO judges have been sacked.

====Review petition filed by Lahore High Court non-PCO removed judges====
Removed ad hoc judges of the Lahore High Court have filed several petitions in the Supreme Court in Lahore for review of its judgment, which sent 76 judges of Supreme Courts and High Courts immediately home.

These judges argue that they were qualified to be appointed as judges of the High Court in accordance with the requirements of Article 193(2)of the 1973 Constitution and were offered to serve as ad hoc judges following the consultation required under the Constitution. They accepted the offer and took oath when the state of emergency was lifted. They never took oath under a PCO and continued performing the functions of judges of the High Court until judgement was rendered against them.

These judges were appointed by Lahore High Court Chief Justice Justice Zahid Hussain, who is still a justice of the Supreme Court of Pakistan and is not being tried before the Supreme Judicial Counsel.

The petition also noted that none of the sacked judges were made parties to the decision against them, nor were they able to comment in the hearing or in some cases aware that the hearing was taking place.  They also allege that no copy of the decision was sent to the High Court or to the judges concerned.

====Key Controversial points====
According one news article,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dailytimes.com.pk/default.asp?page=2009\08\29\story_29-8-2009_pg13_12 |title=Leading News Resource of Pakistan |publisher=Daily Times |accessdate=2009-11-09}}</ref>
the Supreme Court has applied its judgement retroactively, having effect from 3 November 2007. The 14-member Supreme Court bench has not, however, applied the sanction to judges who took oath under the 1999 PCO.  Some of these are current justices, and some have not yet taken a constitutional oath.

Critics of the decision also argue that it is inconsistent with the principles laid down in Malik Asad Ali<U+2019>s case where it was held that the Chief Justice was bound by the Court's judgement. Chief Justice Sajjad Ali Shah was removed from office based on this case.

Inconsistently with the decision, the present Chief Justice Chaudhry has accepted the stance of the government that Justice Dogar was the Chief Justice until his retirement.

Following the decision, the official website of Supreme Court was hacked by an unknown person. The hacked website made derogatory remarks about Chief Justice Chaudhry.
