==History== 

The original ''Gaslight Tavern'' was located at 1241 Oread (as in 13th & Oread on [[Mount Oread|The Hill]]), just off the [[University Of Kansas]] campus in [[Lawrence, Kansas]], and was right next to the Abington Book Shop (publisher of GRIST<ref>[http://www.thing.net/~grist/golpub/fowler/homejef.htm GRIST On-line from GRIST]</ref>) that was owned by the [[Beat poetry|beat poet]], John E. Fowler and wife Sara <ref>[http://www.vlib.us/beats/#fowler John E. Fowler]</ref>. The Gaslight was a popular hangout for students and non-students alike over several decades, from the peaceful times of the [[Silent Generation]] to the more turbulent times of the [[Counterculture|Counter Culture]]. <ref>[http://www.continuinged.ku.edu/is/check/hist620_monhollon.html Lawrence Kansas, and the Making of the Sixties]</ref>

The Gaslight has been featured in poetry and fiction. <ref>[http://www.vlib.us/beats/dorn.html The Beat Generation in the Heartland]</ref> During the era of [[Folk music]], the Gaslight opened the stage to local artists. Later, [[Beat poetry|beat poet]] [[George Edward Kimball]] held 'court' at the Gaslight. 
<ref> [http://www.vlib.us/beats/#kimball George Kimball] </ref> George was noted for running for Douglas County sheriff in 1970 and losing the race; however, Phillip Hill was voted in, and removed from his office, as justice of the peace. <find ref>

KU student Nick Rice <ref name="gaslight"></ref> was shot to death in front of the Gaslight <ref>[http://www.ktka.com/news/2010/apr/21/1970-racial-unrest-sparked-deadly-violence/ 1970: Racial unrest sparked deadly violence]</ref> by local police during an anti-war riot in Summer 1970. 

The building burned in the 70s, under suspicious conditions. <ref>[http://www2.ljworld.com/news/1999/jul/15/jul_15_25_years/ LJ World July 15 25 Years Ago]</ref> <ref>[http://www2.ljworld.com/news/2010/apr/20/1970-memories-violence-city-still-strong/ LJ World 1970: Memories of violence in city still strong]</ref> <ref>[http://www.kansan.com/stories/2005/apr/27/features_kulture_counterculture/ Counter culture at KU] </ref> <ref>[http://mobile.ljworld.com/news/1991/apr/18/hippie_tales/ Hippie Tales]</ref>

The original location of the Gaslight is now a parking area for the KU Student Union.  

In its heyday, the Gaslight, as a bar and grill, offered only pale [[beer]] and adequate hamburgers. Entertainment consisted of juke-box music, pin-ball machines, and a pool table (and conversation). Live entertainment was not a regular event.
