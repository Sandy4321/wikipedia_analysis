The '''Electrical Guitar Company''' (also '''EGC''') of [[Pensacola, Florida]], [[United States of America|USA]], is a manufacturer of all-[[aluminium]] and aluminium-neck [[electric guitar]]s. Operated by machinist and [[luthier]] Kevin Burkett, it produces limited run and custom designed guitars for musicians predominantly in [[North America]], [[Europe]] and to a lesser extent, [[Australasia]] and [[Japan]]. The aluminium-necks, bodies and pickups are all manufactured by EGC, with remaining items being sourced from high-quality manufacturers such as Grover, Gotoh and [[Switchcraft]].
