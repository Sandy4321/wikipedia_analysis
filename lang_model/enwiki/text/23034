"'''I'll Be Lovin' U Long Time'''" is a song by American [[singer-songwriter]] [[Mariah Carey]], taken from her eleventh studio album, ''[[E=MC<U+00B2> (Mariah Carey album)|E=MC<U+00B2>]]'' (2008). It was written by Carey, [[DJ Toomp|Aldrin Davis]], [[Crystal Johnson]] and [[T.I.|Clifford Harris]], and produced by the former two. As the song's [[Hook (music)|hook]] and instrumentation is derived from sampling [[Mark DeBarge]]'s "[[Stay with Me (DeBarge song)|Stay With Me]]", the former and Etterlene Jordan also share songwriting credits. "I'll Be Lovin' U Long Time" was released as the album's third single in the United States, Australasia and select European countries on July 1, 2008. Drawing influence from [[Pop music|pop]], [[Soul music|soul]] and [[Contemporary R&B|R&B]] music genres, and featuring a piano and keyboard-driven melody, the song's lyrics demonstrate the lengths the protagonist will go for her lover, and how she will be 'lovin' him long time'.

The song received generally positive reviews from music critics, with many considering it a highlight from the album. Many reviewers complimented its production and clever interpolation of the DeBarge sample, while some criticized it for being too simple for an artist of Carey's caliber. Though expected by critics to have surely become Carey's nineteenth chart-topping single in the United States, the track only managed to reach a peak position of number fifty-eight on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]. Throughout other countries where it was released, the song achieved relatively weak charting, peaking within the top forty in Japan and Slovakia, and peaking at numbers forty-one, sixty-nine and eighty-four in New Zealand, Canada and the United Kingdom, respectively.

Carey performed "I'll Be Lovin' U Long Time" on few live televised appearances, in comparison to the strong promotional boost the album's lead single, "[[Touch My Body]]" received. She first performed the song live at the [[MTV Video Music Awards Japan]], on June 2, 2008. On July 31, 2008, she performed the song as part of a five-piece outdoor concert filmed for ''[[Jimmy Kimmel Live!]]'', as well as at the 2008 [[Teen Choice Awards]] to a standing ovation on August 8, 2008. Additionally, it was featured on the final scene of ''[[You Don't Mess with the Zohan]]'' (2008), a film in which Carey made a [[cameo appearance]]. The song's accompanying music video was shot over a three day interval in Hawaii, and makes usage of the islands scenery, as well as shots of Carey in several bikinis, while swimming with a dolphin.

=== Lyrical controversy ===
At the time of its release, "I'll Be Lovin' U Long Time" was the subject of controversy with the Asian community, as well as comedian [[Margaret Cho]].<ref name=mtv9>{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1591868/love-long-time-funny-phrase-racial-slur.jhtml?rsspartner=rssYahooNewscrawler|title=Mariah Carey, Fergie Promise To 'Love You Long Time' -- But Is The Phrase Empowering Or Insensitive?|last=Vineyard|first=Jennifer|work=''MTV News''|publisher=Viacom|date=2008-04-09|accessdate=2011-05-10}}</ref> In the film ''Full Metal Jacket'', an Asian prostitute approaches US troops and offers to engage in lewd conduct in exchange for money. She uses terms such as "Me so horny" and "me love you long time", which were heavily parodied and popularized.<ref name=mtv9/> Accordingly, those terms have been used as humor at the expense of Asian people, and have been described as "racial slurs" by Cho.<ref name=mtv9/> Other female acts have been known to use the phrase, such as [[Fergie (singer)|Fergie]] on her track "[[London Bridge (song)|London Bridge]]" (2006), and [[Nelly Furtado]] in "[[Maneater (Nelly Furtado song)|Meaneater]]" (2006).<ref name=mtv9/> In an interview with [[MTV News]], Cho retracted her earlier commetns, and expressed how if used in song, and by a female then it wouldn't be offensive: "I don't mind it when it's used in songs, like when women use it," Cho continued. "Fergie uses it, that doesn't bother me. But when it's shouted in the street and they don't wait to hear the response? What if I was actually going to go, 'Oh, OK'? They never stick around to hear the answer."<ref name=mtv9/>

"I'll Be Lovin' U Long Time" received generally positive reviews from music critics. Many complimented the song's production and incorporation of the "Stay With me" sample, while others were unimpressed with the chorus in general.

=== Synopsis ===
The music video begins with several scenes interspersing, starting with Carey underwater, while holding onto a dolphins fin, as well as Carey lying on a beach at night in a bikini. As the song's introduction plays, scenes of the Hawaii beaches are shown, as well as close-up glimpses of T.I. Carey then is shown inside a small cabana, singing to the camera and enjoying herself at a small party. Similar scenes of Carey in a gold bikini are shown, as well as more scenes of Hawaiian landscape. By the second verse, Carey, now in a black bikini, is shown at the bottom of a ravine by the beach staring at the sun, then altering to scenes of the party once more. As T.I.'s verse starts, he's shown behind a waterfall, in the midst of shrubbery outside, where Mariah then appears sitting in a large body of clear water with golden sand. She then lays in the water, as the scene then switches to her underwater with the dolphin again.
