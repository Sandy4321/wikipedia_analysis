The '''Tyholt Tunnel''' is a {{convert|2785|m|sp=us|adj=on}} railway [[tunnel]] which runs between [[Lerkendal, Trondheim|Lerkendal]] and [[Lademoen]] on the [[Stavne<U+2013>Leangen Line]] in [[Trondheim]], [[Norway]]. The line takes it name for passing under the neighborhood of [[Tyholt]] and is only sees regular freight traffic.

Construction began by the [[Wehrmacht]] during the [[German occupation of Norway]] from 1940 to 1945, but the project was never completed. The [[Norwegian State Railways (1883<U+2013>1996)|Norwegian State Railways]] (NSB) resumed the work in the 1950s. Part of the tunnel was built using [[cut-and-cover]], part using a [[tunneling shield]] and most of it was blasted. It opened on 1 June 1957.

==Specifications==
The Tyholt Tunnel is a {{convert|2785|m|sp=us|adj=on}} un-electrified, single track, [[standard gauge]] railway tunnel. It constitutes nearly half of the the {{convert|5.8|km|sp=us|adj=on}} Stavne<U+2013>Leangen Line, which acts as a bypass around Trondheim.<ref name=bjerke>{{cite book |first=Thor |last=Bjerke |title=Banedata '94 |year=1994 |publisher=Norsk Jernbaneklubb |location=Oslo |language=Norwegian |isbn=82-90286-15-5 |page=87}}</ref> The tunnel is owned by the [[Norwegian National Rail Administration]].<ref name=railstat>{{cite web |url=http://www.jernbaneverket.no/no/dokumenter/Om-oss/Jernbanestatistikk/Jernbanestatistikk-2008/ |title=Railway Statistics 2008 |author=[[Norwegian National Rail Administration]] |year=2009 |format=PDF |accessdate=6 June 2011 |archivedate=3 October 2010 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5tCrrKxuu |deadurl=no |pages=3, 6}}</ref> From the south end, the first {{convert|70|m|sp=us}} is a [[culvert]], the next {{convert|198|m|sp=us}} run through [[sediment]]s and the final {{convert|2517|m|sp=us}} are in bedrock.<ref name=riise>{{cite book |last=Riise |first=T.

==History==
[[File:Stavne<U+2013>Leangen Line map.svg|thumb|left|Map of the Stavne<U+2013>Leangen Line, showing the Tyholt Tunnel and other railway lines in central Trondheim]]
During the German occupation of Norway as part of the Second World War, the Wehrmacht wanted a railway route past Trondheim which was guarded against sabotage. They decided that the best way to do this was to build a tunnel under the neighborhood of Tyholt. However, construction of the tunnel took much longer than expected, so instead the Wehrmach started laying railway tracks in the streets in Trondheim. However, neither of the two lines were completed by the time of [[End of World War II in Europe|German capitulation]] on 8 May 1945.<ref name=aspenberg>{{cite book |last=Aspenberg |first=Nils Carl |authorlink=Nils Carl Aspenberg |title=Glemte spor: Boken om sidebanenes tragiske liv |publisher=Baneforlaget |location=Oslo |year=1994 |isbn=82-9144-800-0 |language=Norwegian |pages=299<U+2013>300}}</ref>

The Norwegian State Railways regained interest in the line during the 1950s and resumed construction.<ref name=aspenberg /> The Tyholt Tunnel was among the first attempts in Norway to build a tunnel through sediments. The southern-most {{convert|70|m|sp=us}} were built using a [[cut-and-cover]] method. The next {{convert|198|m|sp=us}} were built through sediments using a [[tunneling shield]]. It measured {{convert|5|m|sp=us}} in length and had a diameter of {{convert|8|m|sp=us}}. The shield was moved forward with twenty [[hydraulic]] pumps, moving it {{convert|75|cm|sp=us}} at a time. The tunnel received an outer precast concrete shell and a inner ring cast with [[formwork]].<ref name=riise />

The main concern was the up to {{convert|1.0|m|sp=us|adj=on|0}} thick layer of [[quick clay]], which would stick to the shield. When the shield advanced, it would drag with it some of the clay, creating holes which had to be filled with concrete. After {{convert|90|m|sp=us}} an overpressure was required, and a {{convert|30|m|sp=us}} section of tunnel was sealed off. At first a pressure of 0.9&nbsp;[[kilogram-force per square centimeter|km/cm<sup>3</sub>]] (90&nbsp;[[pascal (unit)|Pa]]) was used, later increasing to 1.8 km/cm<sup>3</sup> (180&nbsp;Pa). The remainder of the tunnel was blasted.<ref name=riise />

The line and tunnel were officially opened on 1 June 1957 and revenue traffic started the following day. The tunnel was originally only used for freight trains, although it was occasionally used by passenger trains, especially when there was maintenance work on bridges.<ref name=aspenberg /> Ownership of the tunnel passed to the Norwegian National Rail Administration from 1 December 1996.<ref name=railstat /> NSB launched a now abandoned proposal in 2002 to establish an urban train service in Trondheim, which would have included passenger trains running in a loop through the tunnel. It would have required investments of 120 million [[Norwegian krone]], including a connection for trains to be able to run from the east end of the line and westwards on the Nordland Line, and investments to noise insulate the Tyholt Tunnel.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nrk.no/nyheter/distrikt/nrk_trondelag/1898602.html |title=Bytog i Trondheim |date=5 June 2002 |language=Norwegian |publisher=[[Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation]] |accessdate=26 February 2012 |archivedate=26 February 2012 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/65k91xvcC |deadurl=no}}</ref>
