==Biography and career==
Vijay Antony at the age of 21, discovered that he has always been immensely interested in composing music and also in writing lyrics for the songs he composes. This indomitable interest led him to learn music and the technicalities in music. Soon, he obtained a degree from the [[Trinity College London]] and set up his own in-house studio called Audiophiles at [[Chennai]].<ref>{{cite web|author=Malathi Rangarajan |url=http://www.thehindu.com/arts/cinema/article3665703.ece |title=Arts / Cinema : The bird, and now the elephant |publisher=The Hindu |date=2012-07-21 |accessdate=2012-08-18}}</ref>

Subsequently, he started looking out for a platform to exhibit his talents as a musician and as a composer. Soon, opportunities started opening up for him to compose jingles and scores for popular Indian television features.

In 2004, noted Producer [[Aascar Ravichandran]] identified his potential as a music director and offered Vijay Antony to work as a music director in his movie called 'Dishyum' which was a run-away success.

Though the first movie he signed for as a music director was [[Dishyum]] he was introduced as a debut music director through [[Sukran]] produced by [[S. A. Chandrasekhar]]. Both Sukran and Dishyum had songs with a new feel and a unique tone to it. Lyrics were notably different and soon the songs became a huge hit among the Tamil cinema audience.<ref>{{cite web|author=Sreedhar Pillai, TNN Sep 10, 2008, 12.18am IST |url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2008-09-10/news-interviews/27905896_1_vijay-antony-prakash-raj-sony-bmg |title=SAC<U+2019>s token of thanks to Vijay Antony -  |publisher=[[Times Of India]] |date=2008-09-10 |accessdate=2012-08-18}}</ref>

After Sukran and Dishyum, Vijay Antony as a music director had no turning-back. Soon he had offers coming in to work as a music director. Through his hard, dedicated work, he has been giving consistent hits. He was the first Indian to win the 2009 Cannes Golden Lion for the ''Nakka Mukka'' commercial (for [[Times of India]]) in the Best of Music category. ''Nakka Mukka'' raised his fame and that song was played in the 2011 cricket world cup.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2009-06-28/india/28159732_1_jwt-india-agnello-dias-taproot-india |title=TOI wins India its first Gold Film Lions at Cannes - Times Of India |publisher=Articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com |date=2009-06-28 |accessdate=2012-08-18}}</ref>
