The '''Ffestiniog Railway''' (in [[Welsh language|Welsh]] ''Rheilffordd Ffestiniog'') is a [[narrow gauge|narrow-gauge]] [[heritage railway]], located in North West [[Wales]]. It is one of the most popular [[tourist attraction]]s in Wales, as it weaves in and out of the [[Snowdonia National Park]]. 

The railway is about 13.5 miles (21.5 km) long and runs from the harbour at [[Porthmadog]] to the slate mining town of [[Blaenau Ffestiniog]]. The line travels through spectacular mountainous scenery and has a track gauge of {{1ft11.5in}}. The first part of the line runs along "the Cob", which is the [[dike (construction)|dyke]] of the [[Traeth Mawr]] "[[polder]]". 

== History ==
The railway company is properly known as the "Festiniog Railway Company" and this contemporary spelling (correct for the period) is still the official title of the company as defined by the Act (2 William IV cap.xlviii) that created the railway. It is the oldest surviving railway company in the world, having been founded by the Act of Parliament on [[23 May]] [[1832]] with capital mostly raised in the Dublin area. Most British railways were amalgamated into four large groups in 1921, and then into [[British Rail|British Railways]] in 1948, but the Festiniog Railway Company, in common with most narrow gauge railways, remained independent: in 1921 this was due to political influence, whereas in 1947 it was left out of British Railways because it was closed for traffic despite vigorous local lobbying for it to be included.

The line was constructed between 1833 and 1836 to transport [[slate]] from the quarries around the inland [[town]] of Blaenau Ffestiniog to the coastal town of Porthmadog, where it was loaded onto [[ship]]s. The railway was graded so that loaded wagons could be run by gravity downhill all the way from Blaenau Ffestiniog to the port. The empty wagons were hauled back up by horses, which travelled down in special 'dandy' wagons. There is good evidence for tourist passengers being carried as early as 1850, without the blessing of the Board of Trade. In October 1863 steam locomotives were introduced, to allow longer slate trains to be run, and this also enabled the official introduction of passenger trains in 1865: the Ffestiniog was the first narrow-gauge railway in Britain to carry passengers. In 1869 the line's first double [[Fairlie]] [[articulated locomotive]] was introduced, and these double-ended machines have since become one of the most widely recognised features of the railway.

By the 1920s the demand for slate as a roofing material dropped owing to the advent of newer materials and to the loss of the overseas trade in [[World War I]]. As a result, the railway suffered a gradual decline in traffic. In 1923, the FR was linked with the new [[Welsh Highland Railway]] (WHR), which went bankrupt in 1933, and the FR leased it. The WHR proved to be a financial liability and closed in 1937. Ordinary passenger services ceased on the FR on [[15 September]] [[1939]], shortly after the outbreak of [[World War II]]. The workmen's passenger service ran for the last time on Saturday [[16 September]] [[1939]] and slate traffic ceased on [[1 August]] [[1946]], apart from the section from Duffws to the North Western yard through Blaenau Ffestiniog town centre, which was leased on [[7 October]] [[1946]] to the quarry owners and provided the railway company, that retained the services of a resident manager at Porthmadog, with a small income throughout the moribund years. 

The original Act of Parliament which permitted the building of the line made no provision for its closure or abandonment. Although the line had ceased functioning, the company could not dismantle the railway, so the track and infrastructure were left in place. However without any maintenance, it soon became overgrown and unusable. 

From 1949, various groups of rail enthusiasts attempted to revitalise the railway. Eventually, in 1954 a group of volunteers funded by Alan Pegler purchased the company to run it as a tourist attraction, and gradually restored the line to working order. This was not helped by a decision by the CEGB ([[Central Electricity Generating Board]]) in 1954 to build the Ffestiniog Pumped Storage Scheme, including the Tan y Grisiau reservoir (Llyn Ystradau), which flooded part of the northern end of the line. The Festiniog Railway Company was able to obtain compensation in 1972, after the second-longest legal battle in British legal history, having taken eighteen years and two months. Two years later, as a result of the case, the British [[Parliament]] passed the Land Occupancy Act 1973.

The work of restoration began on [[September 20]] [[1954]] when Morris Jones the foreman fitter who had last worked for the railway in March 1947 rejoined the staff to complete the rebuilding of the locomotive 'Prince' on which he had been engaged when the works closed. He was joined at [[Boston Lodge]] works by two volunteers. The first Passenger train from [[Porthmadog Harbour railway station|Porthmadog]] to [[Boston Lodge railway station|Boston Lodge]] ran on [[July 23]] [[1955]]. The passenger service was extended to [[Minffordd railway station|Minffordd]] on [[May 19]] [[1956]], to [[Penrhyn railway station|Penrhyn]] on [[June 5]] [[1957]] and to [[Tan-y-Bwlch railway station|Tan-y-Bwlch]] on [[April 5]] [[1958]]. A long period of consolidation followed before the extension to [[Dduallt railway station|Duallt]] on [[April 6]] [[1968]].

Between 1965 and 1978, a 'Deviation' route from Dduallt to [[Tanygrisiau railway station|Tanygrisiau]] (reopened on [[June 24]] [[1978]]), including the only [[Spiral (railway)|rail spiral]] in Britain and a tunnel, was built around the reservoir largely by volunteer labour. The through route to Blaenau Ffestiniog was completed in 1982; the group building this deviation were officially called the ''Civil Engineering Group'', but were usually called the ''[[Deviationist]]s''. The new joint station with [[British Rail]] at [[Blaenau Ffestiniog railway station|Blaenau Ffestiniog]] was officially opened on [[April 30]] [[1983]] by [[George Thomas, 1st Viscount Tonypandy|George Thomas]], Speaker of the [[House of Commons]], who unveiled a plaque at the station recording his visit. 

In the late 1980s the Festiniog Railway Company was involved in a highly controversial plan to stop the neighbouring Welsh Highland Railway being rebuilt. The plan would have involved the Company buying the original track bed of the Welsh Highland Railway from the old company's receiver and giving it to Gwynedd County Council, as long as no railway-related developments were allowed on the land. This, and other actions, may have delayed the start of rebuilding of the Welsh Highland Railway by upto to 10 years. 

From 1990 the Festiniog Railway Company has been totally committed to the reopening of the [[Welsh Highland Railway]] and following protracted legal procedures the first section from [[Caernarfon railway station|Caernarfon]] to [[Dinas railway station|Dinas]] was opened and operated by the FR on [[October 11]] [[1997]]. Restoration to [[Waunfawr railway station|Waunfawr]] was completed in 2000 and to [[Rhyd Ddu railway station|Rhyd Ddu]] in 2003. Reconstruction of the remaining section through to Porthmadog is in progress from both ends. In 2009 the Ffestiniog Railway intends to reconnect with the Welsh Highland Railway, comprising parts of the former [[London and North Western Railway]] (1867), [[North Wales Narrow Gauge Railway]] (1877-81), [[Portmadoc, Beddgelert and South Snowdon Railway]] and Welsh Highland (1922-3) Railway when the ''Rheilffordd Eryri'' (its Welsh name) is completed from [[Caernarfon]] to [[Porthmadog]]. The link would join the FR at Harbour Station, with the rebuilt WHR at Pen-y-Mount Station, north of Porthmadog.
