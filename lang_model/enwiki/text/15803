'''Thiophene''' is an [[aromaticity|aromatic]] [[heterocyclic]] compound consisting of four carbon atoms and one sulfur atom in a five-membered ring. Compounds analogous to thiophene include [[furan]] and [[pyrrole]] where the S atom is replaced by O and NH, respectively.  Thiophene was discovered by [[Viktor Meyer]] in 1871 as a contaminant in benzene.
<!-- would be nice to describe the details of Meyer's discovery - something to do with the indophenol? test -->Related to thiophene are [[benzothiophene]] and dibenzothiophene, containing the thiophene ring fused with one and two benzene rings, respectively.

==Properties==
At room temperature, thiophene is a colorless liquid with a mildly pleasant odor reminiscent of [[benzene]], with which thiophene shares some similarities. 

Thiophene is considered aromatic, although theoretical calculations suggest that the degree of aromaticity is less than that of benzene. The participation of the lone electron pairs on sulfur in the [[delocalized]] [[pi electron]] system is significant.  As a consequence of its aromaticity, thiophene does not exhibit the properties seen for conventional [[thioether]]s.  For example the sulfur atom is not alkylated by methyl iodide.  Although the sulfur atom is unreactive, the flanking CH centers are susceptible to attack by [[electrophile]]s.  The high reactivity of thiophene toward sulfonation is the basis for the separation of thiophene from benzene.  Due to the mere 4 <U+00B0>C difference in their boiling points at ambient pressure, thiophene and benzene are difficult to separate by [[distillation]].  Treatment of thiophene-benzene mixtures with sulfuric acid results in preferential [[sulfonation]] of the thiophene to give water-soluble thiophene sulfonic acid.

==Uses==
Thiophenes are important heterocyclic compounds and are recurring building blocks in organic chemistry with applications in pharmaceuticals.  For example, thiophenes are used as synthetic intermediates, taking advantage of the susceptibility of the carbon atoms adjacent to S toward electrophilic reactions. Desulfurization of the resulting ring using [[Raney nickel]] affords 1,4-disubstituted butanes.  The polymer formed by linking thiophene through its 1,5 positions is called [[polythiophene]].  Polythiophenes become electrically conductive upon partial oxidation, i.e. they become "organic metals".

Thiophene is used as a denaturant for [[ethanol]] with which it forms an [[azeotrope]]. 

==Synthesis and occurrence==
Reflecting their high stabilities, thiophenes arise from many reactions involving sulfur sources and hydrocarbons, especially unsaturated ones, e.g. acetylenes and elemental sulfur. Thiophenes are classically prepared by the reaction of 1,4-di[[ketone]]s with sulfiding reagents such as [[Lawesson's reagent]] or P<sub>4<sub>S<sub>10<sub>.   Specialized thiophenes can be synthesized via the [[Gewald reaction]], which involves the condensation of two [[esters]] in the presence of elemental sulfur.

Thiophene and its derivatives occur in [[petroleum]], sometimes in concentrations up to 1-3%.  The thiophenic content of [[liquids]] from [[Petroleum|oil]] and [[coal]] is removed via the [[hydrodesulfurization]] (HDS) process.  In HDS, the liquid or gaseous feed is passed over a special form of [[molybdenum disulfide]] under a pressure of H<sub>2</sub>.  Thiophenes undergo hydrogenolysis to form [[hydrocarbons]] and [[hydrogen sulfide]].  Thus, thiophene itself is converted to butane and H<sub>2</sub>S.  More prevalent and more problematic in petroleum are [[benzothiophene]] and dibenzothiophene.
