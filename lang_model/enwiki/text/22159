'''Mesopotamian mythology''' is the collective name given to [[Sumerian mythology|Sumerian]], [[Akkadian Empire|Akkadian]], [[Assyria]]n, and [[Babylonian mythology|Babylonian]] mythologies from parts of the fertile crescent, the land between the [[Tigris]] and [[Euphrates]] rivers in [[Iraq]].

The [[Sumerians]] practiced a [[polytheistic]] [[religion]], with [[anthropomorphic]] [[deity|gods]] or [[goddess]]es representing forces or presences in the world, in much the same way as later [[Greek mythology]]. According to said mythology, the gods originally created humans as servants and freed them when they became too much to handle.

Many stories in Sumerian religion appear similar to stories in other [[Middle-Eastern]] religions. Gods and Goddesses from Sumer have  similar representations in the religions of the [[Akkad]]ians, [[Canaan]]ites, and others.

==The primary deities for each phase of Mesopotamian religion==
Each representing the earth ([[Sumer]]ian) at the [[Esagila|E'saggila]] temple - [[Eridu]], and also at [[Kish (Sumer)|Kish]].
* [[Assur (god)|Ashur]], Main god of Assyria (sky god) ([[Assyria]]n) - at [[Assur]]
* [[Ninlil]],or Nillina :goddess of air (possibly the south wind) and wife of Enlil ([[Sumer]]ian) - at the E'kur Temple&nbsp;<U+2014> Nippur
* [[Inanna]], The goddess of love and war ([[Sumer]]ian) - at the E'anna temple - [[Uruk]]
* [[Marduk]], originally Ea's son and god of light, Marduk (bibilical Merodach; [[Mordechai]] was named after him) was the main god of [[Aya (goddess)|Aya]], consort of Shamash.
* [[Ninurta]] (Sumerian = Lord Plough) (Pan Mesopotamian) at the E'Girsu (hence also called [[Ningirsu]]) temple - [[Lagash]]
* [[Sneddon]] (Sumerian = Heavy One) The god of food and good harvest.

As social complexity in these cities increased, each god came to resemble a human monarch (Lugal, Lu = Man, Gal = Big), or high priest (Ensi, En = Lord, Si = Country), complete with a family and a court of divine stewards and servants.  Wars between cities were seen to reflect wars in heavens between the gods.

Minor gods were seen as family members of these major divinities.  Thus [[Ereshkigal]] (Eresh = Under, Ki = Earth, Gal = Great) came to be seen as the sister of [[Inanna]], and she came to acquire a husband too, originally Gugalanna, the [[Taurus (astrology)|Wild Bull of Heaven]], (from Gu = Bull, Gal = Great, Anu = Heaven), and subsequently Nergal, the Lord of Death, son ([[Aplu]]) of Enlil and Ninlil.  Servants also became minor divinities, as Isimud the two faced androgynous Steward of Enki; or Ninshabur (Lady Evening) the chief lady-in-waiting of Inanna.

Divinities then proliferated, with there being specific gods of tooth-ache, or aching limbs, goddesses for "Greenery" and "Pasture".  Every aspect of life thus came to be surrounded with its own minor divinity that required gifts or placation, as magic spells multiplied, trying to give people certainty in very uncertain times.

==The Sky deities==
In [[Cuneiform script]], the names of deities are preceded with the [[determinative]] sign [[Dingir|{DINGIR}]]. The same sign can refer to "sky" {AN} or "heaven", or generically to the concept of "god" or "goddess".<ref>Hayes, 2000</ref> The principal Mesopotamian Gods were identified with the sky or celestial bodies. Thus

* [[Sin (mythology)|Sin]] (aka [[Sumerian mythology|Sumerian]] "[[Nanna]] - Suen"), The God of the moon
* [[Shamash]] (aka [[Sumerian mythology|Sumerian]] "[[Utu]]"), The Sun God

The visible planets were also associated with divinities  Thus
* [[Enki]] and later [[Nabu]] was associated with the planet [[Mercury (mythology)|Mercury]]
* [[Inanna]] ([[Sumerian mythology|Sumer]]) or [[Ishtar]] ([[Akkad]]), The Queen of the Heavens and goddess of love and war was a deification of the planet [[Venus]]
* [[Nergal]] was associated with the planet [[Mars]]
* [[Enlil]] and late [[Marduk]] was associated with the planet [[Jupiter]]
* [[Ninurta]] was associated with the planet [[Saturn]]

==Mesopotamian cosmology==
{{See also|Babylonian astronomy|En<U+00FB>ma Eli<U+0161>}}

Mesopotamian cosmology seems to have been seen as a genealogical system of binary opposites being considered as male and female, and, through sacred marriage or [[hieros gamos]], giving birth to successive generations of divinities. The universe first appeared when [[Nammu]], a presumably formless [[abyss (religion)|abyss]], curled in upon herself, giving birth to the primary gods.  According to the [[Babylon]]ian [[Enuma Elish]], the primary union divided into [[Tiamat]], (from [[Sumerian language|Sumerian]] Ti=Life, Ama=mother, t ([[Akkadian language|Akkadian]], a feminine terminal marker)) a salt water divinity, and [[Apsu]] (earlier [[Abzu]] from Ab=water, Zu=far) a fresh water divinity. These in turn gave birth to [[Lahamu]] and [[Lahmu]], called the "muddy" or "the hairy ones", the title given to the gatekeepers of the E'Abzu temple in [[Eridu]], who gave birth to [[Anshar]] (Sky Pivot, or Axle) and [[Kishar]] (Earth Pivot, or Axle) possibly referring to the celestial poles, and considered the parents of [[Anu]] (the Heaven-dome god) and [[Ki (goddess)|Ki]] (the Earth god). These Gods gave their name to the Mesopotamian [[Pantheon (gods)|pantheon]].

The union of An and Ki produced [[Enlil]], who in the Sumerian period eventually became leader of the [[pantheon (gods)|pantheon]]. After the banishment of Enlil from [[Dilmun]] (the home of the gods) for raping [[Ninlil]], Ninlil had a child, [[Sin (god)|Sin]] (god of the moon), also known in Sumerian as [[Nanna]] - Suen. Sin and [[Ningal]] gave birth to [[Inanna]] and to Utu (Sumerian) or [[Shamash]] (Akkadian). During Enlil's banishment, he fathered three "substitute" underworld deities with Ninlil , most notably [[Nergal]]. [http://etcsl.orinst.ox.ac.uk./section1/tr121.htm]

Nammu also gave birth to [[Enki]]. Enki also controlled the [[Me (mythology)|Me]] until [[Inanna]] took them away from Enki's city of [[Eridu]] to her city of [[Uruk]]. The "me" were holy decrees that governed such basic things as physics and complex things such as social order and law. Their transfer from Eridu to Uruk may reflect ancient political events in Southern Iraq, in the [[Jemdet Nasr]] or [[Early Dynastic Period of Sumer]].

In the much later [[Enuma Elish]], of Babylon, it describes the chaos status in which [[Tiamat]] and [[Apsu]], upset by the chaos of the younger gods, attempt to take back creation, until the son of Enki, [[Marduk]], defeated them and re-created the world out of Tiamat's bodies. These myths seem to have in earlier Sumerian versions had [[Enlil]], as god of the Winds and head of the Sumerian pantheon, in the role of Marduk. The purpose of Enuma Elish, composed in the [[Kassites|Kassite]] period was to elevate Marduk, god of the city of Babylon, and make him pre-eminent amongst the old gods, thus demonstrating Babylon's political victory over the old cultures of Sumer and Akkad. In [[Assyria]]n myth, [[Asshur]] takes the place of Marduk.

Other myths tell of the creation of humankind. The younger [[Igigi]] gods go on strike, refusing the work of keeping the creation working and the gods consulted Enki for a solution. He suggested humankind be made from clay, mixed with the blood of the captured God [[Kingu]], son and consort of Tiamat.

The earliest known writings have no author mentioned. One of the first recorded authors was the [[priest]]ess [[Enheduanna]], said to be the daughter of King Sargon of Akkad. She was the priestess of the moon god, Sin, but wrote two very famous prayers to the goddess of love and war, Ishtar.
