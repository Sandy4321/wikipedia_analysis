[[Vice Admiral]] '''Sir Henry Mackay Burrell''', {{post-nominals|country=AUS|KBE,|CB|size=100%}} (13&nbsp;August 1904&nbsp;<U+2013> 9&nbsp;February 1988) was a senior commander in the [[Royal Australian Navy]] (RAN). He served as [[Chief of Navy (Australia)|Chief of the Naval Staff]] (CNS) from 1959 to 1962. Born in the [[Blue Mountains (Australia)|Blue Mountains]], Burrell entered the [[HMAS Creswell|Royal Australian Naval College]] in 1918 as a thirteen-year-old cadet. His first posting at sea was aboard the cruiser {{HMAS|Sydney|1912|6}}. During the 1920s and 1930s, Burrell served for several years on exchange with the [[Royal Navy]], specialising as a navigator. Following the outbreak of World War&nbsp;II, he filled a key liaison post with the [[United States Navy|US Navy]], and later saw action as commander of the destroyer {{HMAS|Norman|G49|6}}, earning a [[Mentioned in Despatches|mention in despatches]].

Promoted [[Captain (naval)|captain]] in 1946, Burrell played a major role in the formation of the RAN's [[Fleet Air Arm (RAN)|Fleet Air Arm]], before commanding the flagship {{HMAS|Australia|D84|6}} in 1948<U+2013>49. He captained the light aircraft carrier {{HMAS|Vengeance|R71|6}} in 1953<U+2013>54, and was twice [[Commander Australian Fleet|Flag Officer of the Australian Fleet]], in 1955<U+2013>56 and 1958. Burrell was appointed a [[Commander of the Order of the British Empire]] in 1955 and a [[Companion of the Order of the Bath]] in 1959. As CNS, he began a major program of acquisitions for the Navy, including new helicopters, [[Minesweeper (ship)|minesweepers]], submarines and [[guided missile destroyer|guided-missile destroyer]]s. He also acted to reverse a plan by the government of the day to dismantle the Fleet Air Arm. [[Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire|Knighted]] in 1960, Burrell retired to his farm near Canberra in 1962 and published his memoirs, ''Mermaids Do Exist'', in 1986. He died two years later, aged eighty-three.

==Post-war career==
[[File:305416Burrell1954.jpg|right|upright=1.25|thumb|Captain Burrell (right) and crew beside a [[Bristol Sycamore]] helicopter on HMAS ''Vengeance'', c. 1954]]
Burrell's first appointment following the cessation of hostilities was as commander of the 10th Destroyer Flotilla.<ref name="Who's Who"/><ref name="Dennis"/> He was promoted [[Captain (naval)|captain]] in June 1946, and became [[Deputy Chief of Navy (Australia)|Deputy Chief of the Naval Staff]] (DCNS) that October. As DCNS, Burrell played a major role in establishing the Navy's [[Fleet Air Arm (RAN)|Fleet Air Arm]] and preparing for the introduction of carrier-based aircraft.<ref name="ADB"/> He was appointed an [[aide-de-camp]] to Governor-General [[William McKell]] in July 1947.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Commonwealth of Australia (Navy Office)|date=October 1947| title=The Navy List| location=Melbourne|url=http://www.navy.gov.au/sites/default/files/documents/Navy_List-October-1947.pdf|page=39|accessdate=20 December 2013}}</ref> From October 1948 to the end of 1949, Burrell served as commanding officer of the heavy cruiser {{HMAS|Australia|D84|6}}, [[flagship]] of the RAN. Posted to Britain in 1950, he attended the [[Royal College of Defence Studies|Imperial Defence College]], London, and spent two years as Assistant Australian Defence Representative.<ref name="ADB"/><ref name="Who's Who"/> He took command of the light aircraft carrier {{HMAS|Vengeance|R71|6}} on 2&nbsp;December 1952, less than three weeks after she was commissioned into the RAN after transfer from the Royal Navy. The ship began working up for deployment to the [[Korean War]] in June 1953, but in the end her place was taken by the carrier {{HMAS|Sydney|R17|6}}. ''Vengeance'' was involved in a collision with HMAS ''Bataan'' near the [[Cocos Islands]] on 5&nbsp;April 1954, while acting as part of the escort for the [[Royal Yacht]] of [[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth&nbsp;II]] and [[Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh|Prince Philip]] during their inaugural tour of Australia, but continued on duty.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.navy.gov.au/hmas-vengeance|title= HMAS Vengeance|publisher=Royal Australian Navy|accessdate=31 August 2013}}</ref>

Completing his tour as captain of ''Vengeance'', Burrell briefly resumed the role of Deputy Chief of the Naval Staff in August 1954.<ref name="ADB"/> The following month he was made an aide-de-camp to the Queen.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Commonwealth of Australia (Navy Office)|date=January 1955| title=The Navy List| location=Melbourne |url=http://www.navy.gov.au/sites/default/files/documents/Navy_List-January-1955.pdf|page=58|accessdate=20 December 2013}}</ref> Burrell was appointed a [[Commander of the Order of the British Empire]] in the 1955 [[New Year Honours]].<ref>{{LondonGazette|issue=40367|date=31 December 1954|startpage=39|supp=yes|accessdate=18 December 2013}}</ref> In February he became [[Commander Australian Fleet|Flag Officer of the Australian Fleet]], with the acting rank of [[rear admiral]]; this was made substantive in July.<ref name="ADB"/> On 12&nbsp;May 1956, he hoisted his standard aboard the recently arrived aircraft carrier {{HMAS|Melbourne|R21|6}}, marking her replacement of sister ship HMAS ''Sydney'' as flagship of the RAN.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.navy.gov.au/hmas-melbourne-ii|title=HMAS Melbourne (II)|publisher=Royal Australian Navy|accessdate=31 August 2013}}</ref> Burrell was posted soon afterwards to the Navy Office, Canberra, to redevelop the service's officer structure, leading to a new ''General List'' of officers' seniority. He served as [[Australian Commonwealth Naval Board|Second Naval Member (Personnel)]] from September 1956 until January 1958, when he again became Flag Officer of the Australian Fleet.<ref name="ADB"/> Appointed a [[Companion of the Order of the Bath]] in the 1959 New Years Honours,<ref>{{LondonGazette|issue=41590|date=30 December 1958|startpage=37|supp=yes|accessdate=18 December 2013}}</ref> Burrell was raised to [[vice admiral]] on 24&nbsp;February and became First Naval Member, the [[Chief of Navy (Australia)|Chief of the Naval Staff]] (CNS).<ref name="ADB"/> He succeeded Vice Admiral [[Roy Dowling|Sir Roy Dowling]].<ref>Rose, ''The Navy Miscellany'', pp. 515<U+2013>516</ref>

[[File:DDG-38.jpg|thumb|upright=1.25|left|{{HMAS|Perth|D 38|6}}, first of the RAN's guided-missile destroyers ordered by Burrell, at sea in 1980]]
As CNS, Vice Admiral Burrell had to contend with a threat by Defence Minister [[Athol Townley]] to disband the Navy's fixed-wing Fleet Air Arm capability by 1963, but gained approval for a major vessel re-equipment drive that was to include new submarines, destroyers, minesweepers, and [[Auxiliary ship|auxiliaries]].<ref name="Stevens pp. 187-188">Stevens, ''The Royal Australian Navy'', pp. 187<U+2013>188</ref> This led among other things to the procurement of British {{sclass-|Oberon|submarine}}s, selected by Burrell when his original preference for an Australian-built craft proved too expensive, as well as {{sclass2-|Ton|minesweeper||ship}}s and the Navy's first purpose-designed [[hydrographic survey]] ship, {{HMAS|Moresby|1963|6}}.<ref name="Dennis"/><ref name="Stevens pp. 187-188"/> The re-equipment program also resulted in augmentation of the RAN's rotary-wing assets with [[Westland Wessex]] anti-submarine warfare helicopters. Most significant was the purchase of three {{sclass-|Charles F. Adams|destroyer|0}} guided-missile destroyers,<ref name="Dennis"/> a decision of "ingenuity and forethought" on the part of Burrell and Navy Minister [[John Gorton]], according to historian [[Tom Frame (bishop)|Tom Frame]].<ref>Frame, ''No Pleasure Cruise'', p. 284</ref> The CNS and his minister enjoyed a close working relationship; Burrell declared that Gorton "deserves our thanks for his efforts", and Gorton called Burrell "one of the most honest, sincere and most dedicated sailors".<ref>Hancock, ''John Gorton'', pp. 90, 95</ref>

The purchase of the destroyers signalled a shift in reliance for equipment from Britain to the United States that was contrary to prevailing Australian defence policy at the time, particularly in what historian Jeffrey Grey described as "the most British of the Australian services, the RAN", and provoked pressure from the Royal Navy and UK shipbuilders, which had lobbied for purchase of their {{sclass2-|County|destroyer}}.<ref name="Dennis"/><ref>Grey, ''Up Top'', p. 21</ref> Burrell later declared that the superiority of the US weapons system was a key factor in his preference for the ''Adams'' design over the County class.<ref name="Jones & Goldrick">Jones; Goldrick, ''Struggling for a Solution'', pp. 7<U+2013>12</ref> On a mission overseas to discuss trends and acquisitions in January 1960, he was rebuffed by Britain's [[Chief of the Defence Staff (United Kingdom)|Chief of the Defence Staff]], Admiral of the Fleet [[Louis Mountbatten, 1st Earl Mountbatten of Burma|Lord Louis Mountbatten]], who mistakenly thought him responsible for the imminent dissolution of the RAN's Fleet Air Arm, but warmly welcomed by the US [[Chief of Naval Operations]], Admiral [[Arleigh Burke]].<ref name="Stevens pp. 187-188"/> As it happened, Burrell would gain credit for maintaining the integrity of the FAA,<ref name="Dennis"/> and its fixed-wing component remained viable until the early 1980s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.navy.gov.au/history/museums/fleet-air-arm-museum |work=Fleet Air Arm Museum |title=Helos take over (1984) |publisher= Royal Australian Navy|accessdate= 31 August 2013}}</ref> He was appointed a [[Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire]] in the [[Queen's Birthday Honours]], [[London Gazette|gazetted]] on 3&nbsp;June 1960.<ref>{{LondonGazette|issue=42052|date=3 June 1960|startpage=4009|supp=yes|accessdate=18 December 2013}}</ref> In June 1961, he met with his opposite numbers in the [[Reg Pollard (general)|Army]] and [[Valston Hancock|Air Force]] at a Chiefs of Staff Committee conference to discuss the necessity of Australia acquiring nuclear weapons; the chiefs agreed that the probability such a capability would be required was remote but that it should remain an option under certain circumstances, a position the defence forces maintained during the ensuing decade.<ref>Stephens, ''Going Solo'', p. 368</ref>
