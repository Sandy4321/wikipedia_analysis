'''"Albertine"''' is artist/songwriter [[Brooke Fraser]]'s eighth single, and her third from her second studio album ''[[Albertine (album)|Albertine]]''. The single includes two B-sides: a live version of "C.S. Lewis Song" recorded live at Hopetoun Alpha, Auckland, as well as a demo version of "Faithful". This demo version is the same version that was a bonus track on the digital download release of the ''Albertine'' album. The song was Fraser's first single not to chart on the New Zealand Singles Chart.

==Background==
The story behind the song is often talked about in interviews (mostly due to it being the title track of her second album), and Fraser wrote at length about the song in the album liner notes of her [[Albertine (album)|Albertine]] album. The song is about an orphan that Fraser met while travelling in Rwanda for the first time in June 2005. Her guide took her to a village school in Kabuga district, and showed her a girl whose life the guide had personally saved. The girl, named Albertine, is described as tall and beautiful by Fraser. Her guide then requested that Fraser write a song about the girl and name it after her. Fraser then wrote the song after returning to Australia after the trip.<ref>{{cite web | title= "WE INTERVIEW BROOKE FRASER"| url= http://www.nzgirl.co.nz/articles/7224 | work = [[NZGirl]] | date= [[2006]]-[[12-05]]| accessdate=2007-07-21}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | title= "INTERVIEW: BROOKE FRASER"| url= http://www.radiochick.co.nz/AllChicks/Interviews/BrookeFraser.aspx | work = Jess O'Connor | accessdate=2007-07-21}}</ref><ref>Album "[[Albertine (album)|Albertine]]" liner notes. 2006.</ref>

==Music video==

The music video for Albertine was shot in May 2007 in [[Rwanda]]. Fraser posted a blog entry in her official [[MySpace]] blog while en route to Rwanda from [[Johannesburg]]. In this entry, she stated:

{{cquote|''I'm en route to Rwanda, ready to be ruined afresh and hopefully be a blessing to the people there amidst the "work" element of the trip... shooting some footage for a special thing I can reveal at a later date...''<ref> blog.myspace.com/brookefraser "I Have A Secret (oooo!)" ([[2007]]-[[05-09]]). Retrieved on [[2007]]-[[07-21]].</ref>}}

Later, on July 15 the video for the song was released on Brooke Fraser's official YouTube account.<ref>{{cite web | title= "Brooke Fraser - Albertine video"| url= http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGx-xU6TnU8 | work = Albertine2006 | accessdate=2007-07-21}}</ref> It shows mostly face shots at the start of the video interspersed with pictures of children from Rwanda, before finally showing Fraser walk along a bridge as Rwandan people walk by.
