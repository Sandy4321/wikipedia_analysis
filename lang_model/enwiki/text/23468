The '''North Avenue Bridge''' can refer to one of three bridges that has carried North Avenue ([[Illinois Route 64]]) over the North Branch of the [[Chicago River]] on the north side of [[Chicago, Illinois]]. A center-pier [[swing bridge]] built in 1877 was replaced in 1907 by a [[bascule bridge]], allowing river traffic more room for maneuvering in and out of the North Canal just north of [[Goose Island (Chicago)|Goose Island]]. 

Due to deteriorating conditions and undercapacity, the bascule bridge was torn down in 2006 to make room for a hybrid [[suspension bridge|suspension]]/[[cable-stayed bridge|cable-stayed]] bridge. The suspension/cable-stayed bridge fully opened on [[May 23]], [[2008]].

== History ==
[[Image:Western Portal, North Avenue Bridge, Chicago, Illinois.jpg|thumb|Western portal of the original North Avenue Bridge, constructed in 1907]]

As Chicago grew into a center of industry and commerce in the late 19th century, numerous fixed-span crossings were replaced by center-pier [[swing bridge]]s, the most common type of bridge that allowed pedestrians and wagons to cross the Chicago River while also periodically allowing ship traffic below. In 1877, one of these bridges was constructed just north of Goose Island.<ref name="haer">{{cite web |url=http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/ampage?collId=hhdatapage&fileName=il/il0800/il0834/data/hhdatapage.db&title2=North%20Avenue%20Bridge,%20Spanning%20North%20Branch%20of%20Chicago%20River%20at%20West%20North%20Avenue,%20Chicago,%20Cook%20County,%20IL&recNum=0&itemLink=D?hh:17:./temp/~ammem_xBuT:: |title=North Avenue Bridge, HAER No. IL-154 |author=Hess, Jeffrey A. |publisher=National Park Service |date=1999}}</ref>

=== 1907 bascule bridge ===
The historic bridge preceding the current bridge was a trunnion [[bascule bridge]] constructed in 1907. The bridge had an entire structure length, including approaches, of {{convert|273|ft|m|0}}, and a roadway width of {{convert|36|ft|m|0}}. The American Bridge Company fabricated the structure, with Roemheld and Gallery being the superstructure contractors. The substructure contractors were Jackson and Corbett. Chicago is a city that played an important role in the development of the bascule bridge, particularly the trunnion design. The North Avenue Bridge is one of the oldest of these bridges in Chicago along with some other neighboring structures on the North Branch of the Chicago River.<ref name="hbme" />

=== Decline of the North Branch shipping district ===
The historical bridge was last raised in 1972. As the surrounding area transformed from primarily industrial to residential and commercial in nature, traffic volumes on the aging bridge increasing, causing bottlenecks.<ref name="madhani_20060617" />

As required by Section 106 regulations, the city offered the structure to any interested parties for relocation and preservation elsewhere. Because of the complexity of the outdated lifting mechanism, no cities offered to take the bridge.<ref name=hbme>{{cite web | last = Holth | first = Nathan | title = Historic Bridges of Michigan and Elsewhere - North Avenue Bridge | url=http://www.historicbridges.org/illinois/north/index.htm | accessdate = 2006-10-18 }}</ref>

== 2007-2008 bridge replacement ==
Due to age and the high cost of maintenance, a replacement fixed-span bridge was built through 2007<U+2013>2008. The new bridge is a fixed-span, hybrid [[suspension bridge|suspension]]/[[cable-stayed bridge|cable-stayed]] bridge of the same height but nearly twice as long in length. The original bridge was two lanes wide; the new bridge has four lanes plus sidewalks, helping to reduce congestion caused by the 40,000 cars/day that travel on the bridge.<ref name="madhani_20060617">{{cite news |author=Madhani, Aamer |title=Bridge to traffic sanity |publisher=Chicago Tribune |date=2006-06-17 |accessdate=2006-06-17 |url=http://docs.newsbank.com/openurl?ctx_ver=z39.88-2004&rft_id=info:sid/iw.newsbank.com:NewsBank:CTRB&rft_val_format=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:ctx&rft_dat=1124F6411A4B75E8&svc_dat=InfoWeb:aggregated5&req_dat=AA98CDC331574F0ABEAFF732B33DC0B2 }}</ref> In addition, the deck is only {{convert|4|ft|m|0}} thick.<ref name="thomas_20060617">{{cite news |url=http://docs.newsbank.com/openurl?ctx_ver=z39.88-2004&rft_id=info:sid/iw.newsbank.com:NewsBank:CSTB&rft_val_format=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:ctx&rft_dat=1124EE8DB02030C0&svc_dat=InfoWeb:aggregated5&req_dat=AA98CDC331574F0ABEAFF732B33DC0B2 |author=Thomas, Monifa |date=2006-06-17 |accessdate=2008-07-14 |publisher=Chicago Sun-Times |title=Mini-Golden Gate to span river at       North Avenue       : Hybrid suspension       bridge       will be one of a kind for Chicago}}</ref>

The new bridge was completed in 22&nbsp;months, and cost [[US$]]25,000,000 to build.<ref name="tribune_photo" />

== Similar bridges ==
The [[Damen Avenue Bridge]] over the north branch of the Chicago River was a bascule bridge replaced by an [[arch bridge]] in 1999. The [[Cortland Street Bridge]] is regarded as one the most historically significant bridges in Chicago because it was the first of the trunnion style bridges built, with a 1901 construction date. A few similar bridges still remain on the North Branch of the [[Chicago River]] leading to [[Goose Island (Chicago)|Goose Island]].
