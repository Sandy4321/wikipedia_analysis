'''Werburh''' or '''W<U+00E6>rburh''' (also known as '''Werburgh''' and '''Werburga''') (d. February 3, 699 at [[Trentham, Staffordshire|Trentham]]) is an [[England|English]] [[saint]] and the [[patron saint]] of [[Chester]].

She was born at [[Stone, Staffordshire|Stone]] (now in [[Staffordshire]]), and was the daughter of King [[Wulfhere of Mercia]] (himself the [[Christian]] son of the [[Celtic polytheism|pagan]] King [[Penda of Mercia]]) and his wife [[Ermenilda of Ely|St Ermenilda]], herself daughter of the [[Eorcenberht of Kent|King of Kent]]. She was a [[nun]] for most of her life, and was tutored under her great aunt [[Etheldreda]] (or Audrey), the first [[Abbess of Ely]] and former queen of [[Northumbria]].  

Werburh was instrumental in [[convent]] reform across England. She eventually succeeded her mother Ermenilda, her grandmother [[Seaxburh of Ely|Seaxburh]], and great-aunt Etheldreda as fourth Abbess of Ely.

She was buried at [[Hanbury, Staffordshire|Hanbury]] in Staffordshire and her remains were later transferred to Chester, of which church and monastery she became the great patroness (see [[Chester Cathedral]]). She is the last abbess whose name is recorded.

By the year 708 her brother [[Cenred of Mercia|Cenred]] had succeeded as king of [[Mercia]]; he now decided to move his sister's body to a more conspicuous place within the church at Hanbury. Her body was found to be miraculously intact. This was considered to be a sign of divine favour, and her tomb therefore became an object of veneration and a centre for [[pilgrim]]age. Her brother is said to have been so affected by this miracle that he decided to abdicate and enter holy orders himself; however, he came from a notably religious family (his mother, grandmother and great-aunt all being abbesses). It is possible that the anecdote about the saint reviving a [[goose]] dates from this time.  

The shrine of St Werbergh remained at Hanbury for the next 160 years or so but due to the threat from [[Viking]] raiders in the 9th century, the shrine was relocated in 875 to the Church of St. Peter and St. Paul which lay within the protection of the city walls of Chester.

The city of Chester therefore became the focus for the cult of Werburga. Sometime later, the Church of St. Peter and St. Paul was re-dedicated to St. Werburh and [[St Oswald]] around the year 975, when a monastery was also built in the names of these two saints.

In 1057 the church was rebuilt and further endowed by [[Leofric of Mercia|Leofric, Earl of Mercia]]. By this time, St. Werburh was regarded as the protector and patron saint of the city, after the supposed miraculous withdrawal of the [[Wales|Welsh]] king [[Gruffudd ap Llywelyn]] from a siege of the city. 

St. Werburh remained popular after the Norman conquest. In 1093, the Norman [[Earl of Chester]], [[Hugh d'Avranches]], better known as "Hugh the Wolf" to the Welsh, further endowed the abbey and its church. He also established a [[Benedictine]] monastery, with monks from [[Bec Abbey]] in [[Normandy]], which had provided the first two post-Conquest [[Archbishop of Canterbury|Archbishops of Canterbury]]: [[Lanfranc]] and [[Anselm of Canterbury|Anselm]]). Like many other Anglo-Norman barons, Hugh d'Avranches entered the monastery himself shortly before he died. He was buried therein. The abbey became [[Chester Cathedral]] in 1540 and was rededicated to Christ and the Blessed Virgin Mary.

An elaborate shrine had been constructed in the fourteenth century but did not survive the reign of [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]]. When the abbey was dissolved, the shrine was broken up and the remains of the saint scattered. The various remains of the shrine that survived were collected together in 1876, reassembled, and now remain on display to this day at the Lady Chapel of the cathedral.
