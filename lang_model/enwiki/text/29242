{{Ethnic Omaha (sidebar)}}
'''Racial tension in [[Omaha, Nebraska]]''' occurred mostly because of the city's volatile mixture of high numbers of new [[immigrants]] from southern and eastern Europe and African-American migrants from the [[Deep South]]. While racial discrimination existed at several levels, the violent outbreaks were within working classes. [[Irish in Omaha, Nebraska|Irish Americans]], the largest and earliest immigrant group in the 19th century, established the first neighborhoods in South Omaha.  All were attracted by new industrial jobs and most were from rural areas. There was competition among ethnic Irish, newer [[Ethnic groups in Omaha, Nebraska|European immigrants]], and African-American migrants from the South, for industrial jobs and housing. They all had difficulty adjusting to industrial demands, which were unmitigated by organized labor in the early years.  Some of the early labor organizing resulted in increasing tensions between groups, as later arrivals to the city were used as strikebreakers.

In Omaha as in other major cities, racial tension has erupted at times of social and economic strife, often taking the form of mob violence as different groups tried to assert power.  Much of the early violence came out of labor struggles in early 20th century industries: between working class ethnic whites and immigrants, and blacks of the [[Great Migration]].  Meatpacking companies had used the latter for strikebreakers in 1917 as workers were trying to organize.  As veterans returned from World War I, both groups competed for jobs. By the late 1930s, however, interracial teams worked together to organize the meatpacking industry under the [[United Packinghouse Workers of America]] (UPWA).  Unlike the AFL and some other industrial unions in the CIO, UPWA was progressive.  It used its power to help end [[Racial segregation in the United States|segregation]] in restaurants and stores in Omaha, and supported the [[civil rights movement]] in the 1960s. Women labor organizers such as [[Tillie Olsen]] and [[Rowena Moore]] were active in the meatpacking industry in the 1930s and 1940s, respectively.

Most violence and civil unrest in the 1960s, by contrast, arose out of poverty and problems caused by massive loss of working-class jobs through industrial restructuring.  The city's African-American community suffered particularly and erupted in protest.

==19th century==
The [[Nebraska Territory]] was created in 1854 with the condition that the area stay slave-free. But, from 1855 on, there was debate in the [[Nebraska State Legislature|Territorial Legislature]] about whether slavery should specifically be prohibited. As there were few slaves in the state, some legislators did not think the bill was needed.<ref>Bristow, D. (2002) ''A Dirty, Wicked Town: Tale of 19th Century Omaha.'' Caxton Press.</ref> In 1859, the ''Daily Nebraskian'' newspaper reported its favoring of [[slavery]], writing,

:The bill introduced in [Omaha City] Council, for the [[Abolitionism|abolition of slavery]] in this Territory, was called up yesterday, and its further consideration postponed for two weeks. A strong effort will be made among the Republicans to secure its passage; we think, however, it will fail. The farce certainly cannot be enacted if the Democrats do their duty.<ref>A ''Daily Nebraskian'' newspaper editorial from 1859, as quoted in Bristow, D. (2002) ''A Dirty, Wicked Town: Tale of 19th Century Omaha.'' Caxton Press.</ref>

During that period, some local newspapers openly editorialized against the presence of blacks in Omaha, for the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]] and against the election of [[Abraham Lincoln]].<ref>Several sources in Bristow, D. (2002)</ref> The 1860 census showed that of the 81 Negroes in Nebraska, only 10 were slaves.<ref>(1938) [http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?ammem/wpa:@field(DOCID+@lit(wpa116041210+)) Authur Goodlett]. ''American Life Histories: Manuscripts from the Federal Writers' Project, 1936-1940''.</ref> 

Because a clause in the original proposed [[Nebraska Territory#History|Nebraska State Constitution]] limited [[voting rights]] in the state to "free white males", as had been common in many states, Nebraska was delayed about a year from entering the Union. In 1865, the Nebraska Territorial Legislature changed the proposed State Constitution to provide expanded suffrage.  The territory gained statehood soon after.

After the Civil War, enough blacks lived in Omaha to organize [[St. John's African Methodist Episcopal Church]] in 1867 as the first church for African Americans in Nebraska.<ref>(2003) [http://www.memoriallibrary.com/NE/Ethnic/Negro/church.htm The Negroes of Nebraska: The Negro goes to church.] Memorial Library.</ref> The first recorded birth of an African American was that of William Leper, recorded in Omaha in 1872.<ref>(1895) "Negroes in Omaha," ''Omaha Progress'' February 21, 1895.</ref> In 1891 a mob [[lynched]] [[Joe Coe|George Smith]], an [[African American]] man, for allegedly [[raping]] a "white" woman.

==20th century==
[[Image:Omaha Riot Will Brown.jpg|thumb|200px|1919 [[lynching]] victim [[Will Brown]].]]
In the early 1900s, social tensions of the rapidly industrializing city absorbing waves of new immigrants and migrants broke out in riots between ethnic minorities.  The riots included extensive property damage and some deaths.

=== South Omaha ===
{{main|South Omaha}}

South Omaha was where many different immigrant groups established their own neighborhoods.  These ranged from Sheelytown for ethnic [[Irish American|Irish]] to Polish and Czech. [[Little Italy, Omaha|Little Italy]] and [[Little Bohemia (Omaha, Nebraska)|Little Bohemia]] closely bordered South Omaha at it's north boundary as well.  The immigrants comprised most of the workers at the stockyards and meatpacking plants, also located there.  They started organizing different laborers and stopped work with strikes. The industry responded by hiring workers from other parts of the country who were also seeking work: both European immigrants and black migrants from the South (whose numbers doubled in Omaha from 1910-1920).  In 1905, more than 800 students (mostly children of immigrant workers) in South Omaha protested the presence of [[Japanese people|Japanese]] students at their school, calling them "scabs". The Japanese students were children of [[strikebreaker]]s brought in by the [[Omaha Stockyards]] the previous summer during a fierce strike. Children of the regular workers refused to attend classes and locked teachers out of the building.<ref>[http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?res=9E01E7DD173DE733A2575BC1A9629C946497D6CF "Revolt over Japanese; South Omaha School Children Want Them Expelled"], ''The New York Times.''

=== Greek Town Riot ===
{{main|Greek Town Riot}}

[[Greeks in Omaha, Nebraska#Greek Town|Greek Town]] was a growing [[Greeks|Greek]] immigrant community in [[South Omaha]]. Other immigrants resented the Greeks, who had come to the city as [[strikebreaker]]s.  Many men of the community had been jobless for an extensive period after they were [[lay off|laid off]] following the strikes.  Some Omaha citizens assumed they were lazy rather than unemployed. In September 1909 a male resident of the Greek community was arrested by an ethnic Irish South Omaha policeman for allegedly having a relationship with a "white" woman. (He was taking English lessons from her.) The man took the officer's gun and shot him.  After the Greek was captured a short while later, a mob of ethnic whites numbering about 1,000 arrived at the door of the jail.  By then the South Omaha policemen had transferred the man to the Omaha city jail. (The jurisdictions were then separate.)  Frustrated, the mob turned to the Greek neighborhood and began to destroy it, threatening all of its residents with death if they stayed in town. Within a day the Greek residents abandoned the six-by-six block area and scattered into cities across the Midwest. Meanwhile, the mob destroyed the entire neighborhood.  The accused Greek immigrant was brought to trial; but, after intervention from the Greek ambassador to the U.S., who protested the government's failure to protect the immigrant community, the city of Omaha released the man and dropped charges against him. 

=== Anti-German sentiments ===
{{main|Germans in Omaha, Nebraska}}

In the immediate years after [[World War I]] and defeat of Germany by the [[Allies]], anti-German sentiment ran high across the country. The Nebraska legislature passed a law in 1919 that enforced teaching in English in public schools. (Because of substantial immigration by Germans to Nebraska, in earlier years, studies in German were available in the public schools, along with French and classical languages.)  By law, "No person, individually or as a teacher, shall, in any private, denominational, parochial or public school, teach any subject to any person in any language than the English language."<ref>[http://www.law.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/conlaw/Meyer%20v%20Nebraska%20(1923).html "U.S. Supreme Court: MEYER v. STATE OF NEBRASKA, 262 U.S. 390 (1923)"]. University of Kansas City. Retrieved 9/3/07.</ref> Robert Meyer was found to violate this law because he taught German.  He was taken to court by the State of Nebraska, and when found guilty he appealed. Although his appeal to the [[Nebraska Supreme Court]] failed, the [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] in ''[[Meyer v. Nebraska]]'' determined that Meyer had the right to teach the German language as a subject, and to teach it in German. During the course of the year, open [[discrimination]] against Germans throughout Omaha was taking hold. Many German-language newspapers were forced to change to English, or to close.<ref>Folsom, B.W. (1999) ''No More Free Markets Or Free Beer: The Progressive Era in Nebraska, 1900-1924''. Lexington Books. p 112.</ref>

=== Red Summer ===
{{main|Omaha Race Riot of 1919}}
{{further|Red Summer}}

In September 1919, following a summer of racial riots in several other industrial cities, an African-American laborer named [[Willy Brown]] was lynched in Omaha.  He had been accused of raping a young white woman.  A mob of 5,000 ethnic white men marched from South Omaha (some young men were classmates of the woman) and appeared at the [[Douglas County Courthouse (Omaha)|Douglas County Courthouse]] to demand "justice". Within hours the mob grew to 10,000 people. Many were drinking. When the reform mayor [[Edward P. Smith]] attempted to intervene, he was lynched by the mob.  Only a last-minute rescue saved him from being hanged.  The mob threw stones at windows, far outnumbered the police, and set the courthouse on fire to force the release of Brown.  The police turned him over to save other prisoners.  In a frenzy, the mob hung Brown from a lamppost and shot him, later dragged his body and burned it. The mob turned against police vehicles and attacked any blacks they found in the street.  They began to move toward a large [[Near North Side (Omaha, Nebraska)|African-American enclave]] in North Omaha.  The city and governor had called in the U.S. Army from [[Fort Omaha]] to intervene.  It stationed troops in North Omaha to protect the blacks, and after gaining control of the mob, in South Omaha to prevent any more riots forming.  An unseasonal rainstorm cooled the mob down as well. The Army commander established [[martial law]] for several days.  A grand jury's investigation identified the mob as arising from South Omaha and being encouraged by the city's vice world. No one was charged in the events, however.

=== Anti-Black racism ===

On July 4, 1910 African American boxer [[Jack Johnson (boxer)|Jack Johnson]] won a major upset at a national match in [[Reno, Nevada]]. Upon hearing the news, a dozen fights broke out in different areas of the city between whites and blacks, as happened in other cities.  Whites wounded several black men and killed one.<ref>[http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?_r=1&res=9A0CE5DD1E39E333A25756C0A9619C946196D6CF&oref=login "Omaha negro killed"], ''The New York Times.'' July 5, 1910. Retrieved 4/20/08.</ref> 

After [[World War I]], white veterans trying to return to their civilian jobs found African-American and Eastern European immigrants in their former positions. Their resentment led to several violent strikes in the [[South Omaha]] [[meat packing]] industry as groups tried to control access to jobs. During this period, Earl Little was a Baptist minister in North Omaha. After his son, Malcolm, was born in Omaha in 1925, the family moved away because of threats by the [[Ku Klux Klan]] in 1926. (The KKK had undergone a revival and growth in the Midwest in the early 1920s.)  Malcolm Little later changed his last name to X, when he joined the [[Black Muslims]], where he became an important leader known as [[Malcolm X]].<ref>Malcolm X.

In the 1920s, [[racial segregation]] became normalized in Omaha as [[redlining]] and [[restrictive covenants]] kept African Americans concentrated in housing in [[North Omaha]].<ref>''A Street of Dreams'' Nebraska Public Television.</ref>  The riot had discredited the city's newly elected reformist government.  In the next election, "Cowboy" [[Jim Dahlman]] was returned to office with the support of Tom Dennison, the informal leader of the vice world.  The labor struggles and social struggles led Omaha's African-American leaders, such as Earl Little, [[Harry Haywood]] and [[George Wells Parker]], to push harder for civil rights.<ref>Davies, P. (2002) ''American Road: The Story of an Epic Transcontinental Journey at the Dawn of the Motor Age.'' Henry Holt and Co. P 107.</ref> After this period, African Americans in Omaha were largely concentrated as residents on the city's north side, with a small community in South Omaha.

== Civil Rights Movement-era ==
{{main|Civil rights movement in Omaha, Nebraska}}

In 1947 a student-led civil rights group called the [[DePorres Club]] was forced off the [[Creighton University]] campus, where they started.  [[Mildred Brown]], a community activist and publisher, invited them to meet at the ''Omaha Star'', the paper she directed for the African-American community for decades.<ref>(n.d.)[http://www.nebraskastudies.org/0800/frameset_reset.html?http://www.nebraskastudies.org/0800/stories/0801_0400.html Mildred Brown] ''Nebraska Studies.''</ref>

Omaha jazz legend [[Preston Love]] reported that in the 1950s he saw signs in Omaha restaurants and bars that said, "We Don't Serve Any Colored Race", but that he was always welcome as a musician.<ref>Bristow, D. (n.d.) [http://www.nebraskalife.com/PrestonLove.asp Swingin' with Preston Love]. ''Nebraska Life.''</ref> In the 1950s, the United Meatpacking Workers of America (UPWA) helped use their power to have businesses in Omaha integrate their facilities.

The late 1950s and early 1960s was the period which [[Lois Mark Stalvey]] wrote about in ''The Education of a WASP''.  She recounted her [[activist]] efforts to desegregate a middle-class [[West Omaha]] neighborhood for an African-American surgeon and his family who wanted to live in the area.  Such efforts took place in a different environment from the struggles of most working-class families in North and South Omaha.<ref>[http://www.wisc.edu/wisconsinpress/books/0410.htm Lois Mark Stalvey, ''Three to Get Ready: The Education of a White Family in Inner City Schools''], University of Wisconsin Press. Retrieved 9/21/07.</ref>

In 1955, the [[State of Nebraska]] took Omaha's main amusement park, [[Peony Park]], to district court. The state believed that the park, founded in 1919, violated Nebraska Civil Rights Law when [[African American]] swimmers at the [[Amateur Athletic Union]] Swimming Meet held at the park on August 27, 1955 were discriminated against. In ''State of Nebraska v. Peony Park'', the [[Nebraska Supreme Court]] found that two African-American participants were illegally barred from the meet because Peony Park barred them from the pool. On September 7, 1955, the court fined Peony Park $50 and costs of the trial. Additional civil suits were settled out of court.<ref>[http://sunsite.berkeley.edu/meiklejohn/meik-1_2/meik-1_2-3.html Civil Liberties Docket]. Vol. I, No. 2.

By the early 1960s, economic progress by many African Americans and ethnic Americans became unraveled in the massive job losses caused by restructuring of railroad and meatpacking industries. By the mid-1960s, [[North Omaha]] had much more poverty than before and increasing social problems. On July 4, 1966, tensions broke out in a riot after a day of blistering 103 degree weather.  Refusing a police order to disperse, African Americans demolished police cars and attacked the North 24th Street business corridor, throwing firebombs and demolishing storefronts.  Businesses in the Near North Side suffered millions of dollars in damages.<ref>Luebtke, F.C.

Leaders in the community criticized the ''[[Omaha World-Herald]]'' and local television stations for blaming African Americans for the conditions they faced in their deteriorating neighborhoods, when the problems of joblessness and decreased maintenance were beyond city and regional control.<ref name="Olson, J.C 1997 p 371">Olson, J.C. and Naugle, R.C.

Later it was nominated for an [[Academy Award|Oscar]] for best documentary.

In March 1968 a crowd of high school and university students gathered at the [[Omaha Civic Auditorium]] to protest the presidential campaign of [[George Wallace]], the segregationist governor of [[Alabama]].  After counter-protesters began acting violently toward the [[youth activism|activists]], [[police brutality]] led to dozens of protesters being injured. During the melee, an African-American youth was shot and killed by a police officer.  Students' fleeing the outbreak attacked businesses and cars, causing thousands of dollars of damage.<ref>[http://press.creighton.edu/031904/cu125.html "Peaceful protest turns violent"], ''The Creightonian Online.'' Retrieved 4/16/08.</ref>

The following day a local barber named [[Ernie Chambers]] helped calm a disturbance and prevent a riot by students at Horace Mann Junior High School. Chambers was already recognized as a community leader.  After finishing his law degree, Chambers was elected to the [[Nebraska State Legislature]].  He went on to serve a total of 38 years, longer than any of his predecessors.<ref name="Olson, J.C 1997 p 371"/> [[Robert Kennedy]] visited Omaha later that year in his quest to become president, speaking in support of Omaha's civil rights activists.

An African-American teenager named Vivian Strong was shot and killed by police officers in an incident at the [[Logan Fontenelle Housing Projects]] in June 1969. Young African Americans in the area rioted after the teenager's death, and looted along the North 24th Street business corridor. Eight businesses were destroyed by firebombing or looting.<ref>Luebtke, F.C. (2005) ''Nebraska: An Illustrated History.

In 1970 an African-American man named Duane Peak was arrested, and quickly implicated six others in a bombing at a vacant house in North Omaha that killed a police officer. On August 31, local [[Black Panther Party]] leaders David Rice and Ed Poindexter were arrested in the case, despite not having been originally implicated. In 1971 both men were convicted of murder in the controversial [[Rice/Poindexter Case]], and in 1974 a retrial of Rice and Poindexter was denied by the Nebraska State Supreme Court.

=== Late 20th century ===

The 1970s construction of the [[North Freeway (Omaha, Nebraska)|North Freeway]] bisected North Omaha, effectively cutting the African-American community in half and creating social problems. In 1976, the [[Omaha Public Schools]] began court-ordered busing to achieve integration.<ref name="ReferenceA">''1954-1979''. Omaha World Herald (Nebraska) June 13, 2004</ref> 

In 1981 arsonists burned an [[East Omaha]] duplex after an African-American family signed a [[rental agreement]] there. The arson is unsolved.<ref name="Burbach, C 2007">Burbach, C. "Robbery, fire evoke memories of neighborhood's racist past," ''Omaha World Herald.'' February 26, 2007.</ref> 

In 1993 the Nebraska Parole Board voted for the first time to unanimously commute the sentences of Rice and Poindexter to [[time served]]. The Nebraska Board of Pardons refused to schedule a hearing in the matter. This same sequence of events has occurred no fewer than three times since then, with the same outcome each time.

In 1995 an African-American gang member murdered an Omaha police officer named Jimmy Wilson, Jr. The city responded by equipping every police car with a camera and giving North Omaha officers body armor. Later that year arsonists tipped over and burned an African-American woman's car in [[East Omaha]] near the site of the 1981 arson. Both cases are unsolved.<ref name="Burbach, C 2007"/> 

In 1996 the Omaha Public Schools ended court-ordered busing.<ref>''Omaha World Herald'', June 13, 2004</ref> That same year the ''Omaha World-Herald'' reported that, "One resident of Rose Garden Estates near 172nd and Pacific Streets said privately, for instance, that he finds the prospect of being incorporated into the city 'increasingly scary.'

In 1997, an African-American [[Gulf War]] veteran named Marvin Ammons was shot and killed by an Omaha police officer. A [[grand jury]] found the officer guilty of [[manslaughter]]; the conviction was overruled on appeal due to a finding of [[jury misconduct]]. A second grand jury [[acquitted]] the offer of wrongdoing and admonished the [[Omaha Police Department|Omaha police department]] for mishandling the case.

In 2000, George Bibbins, an African American, led Omaha police on a high-speed car chase. At the end of the chase, he was shot and killed by officers. A grand jury later acquitted the accused officers of any wrongdoing.

That year the [[Nebraska State Legislature]] enacted [[term limit]]s. Some believed this action was directed against the long-time State Senator Ernie Chambers, an African American who had then served 27 years.<ref>Associated Press (Apr 25, 2005). For the Record. ''Lincoln Journal Star.'' Retrieved on 24 May 2006.</ref> In 2005 Chambers became the longest-serving State Senator in Nebraska history, with more than 32 years of service. Because of the 2002 law, he was not allowed to run for office again once his term expired in 2008.

[[Desegregation busing]] and [[racial integration]] in public schools were contentious issues in Omaha.  Problems with public schools were a factor in middle-class people moving to the suburbs, but the shift in population to suburbs also followed the growth of the city and highways.  Omahans' preference for larger, newer housing was just like that of other Americans.  Middle-class African Americans have also moved to the suburbs here and in other cities.<ref>''"One resident of Rose Garden Estates near 172nd and Pacific Streets said privately, for instance, that he finds the prospect of being incorporated into the city "increasingly scary."

=== Schooling ===

From 1976 to 1999, Omaha had a [[integrated busing|busing]] plan as an effort to integrate the schools.<ref name="ReferenceA"/> Busing was an early goal of civil rights leaders and groups in Omaha, including 4CL, who lauded integrated busing as a particularly important step in improving race relations.<ref>''A Street of Dreams.''</ref>  When the city considered ending busing in the 1990s, Concerned and Caring Educators, a 100-member group of black education administrators and supervisors, praised the system as having improved race relations and the education of Omaha's students.<ref>Ngyren, J. "Black Group: Ending Busing A Step Back", ''Omaha World Herald'', March 14, 1996.</ref> 

[[Omaha Public Schools]] ended busing to achieve integration in 1999.  It responded to parental desires for neighborhood schools and for choice.  It has created magnet schools to attract students from middle-class families.  As in many other cities, concerns about schools are high.  Like some other districts such as [[Louisville, Kentucky]], Omaha has begun to explore socioeconomic integration - assigning students according to family income - to change the makeup of their schools and address low test scores among poor children in the inner city. There have been delays in efforts to unite the Omaha public school district with newly annexed smaller, local districts in the western half of the city.<ref>Robb, J.

==21st century==
Senator Ernie Chambers proposed a controversial school separation plan for Omaha in the Nebraska State Legislature in response to concerns by suburban districts outside Omaha boundaries. The state legislature was interested in seeking a way to use suburban districts to help integrate the city's schools.  "The law, intended to resolve a boundary dispute between the Omaha schools and largely white suburban districts, created a learning community of area school districts that would operate with a common tax levy and required them to draw up an integration plan for metropolitan Omaha."<ref name="nytimes.com">{{cite news | author=''[[The New York Times]]'' | title=Law to Segregate Omaha Schools Divides Nebraska | year=Apr 15, 2006 | url=http://www.nytimes.com/2006/04/15/us/15omaha.html?ex=1302753600&en=613ee46cacb5fefa&ei=5088&partner=rssnyt&emc=rss | accessdate=2006-05-24 | date=April 15, 2006}}</ref>

Chambers lobbied to create three districts in the city, with each drawn along geographic boundaries that loosely correlated to the racial segregation of the city: African Americans in [[North Omaha]], Hispanic/Latinos in [[South Omaha]], and Caucasians in West Omaha.  Chambers defended his decision from the standpoint that much of the city had [[residential segregation]] and that his plan would provide African American parents in North Omaha with more control over their district.<ref>Saunders, Michaela. ''Chambers up close A Q&A with the senator, whose OPS views are rooted in his youth''. Omaha World Herald (April 30, 2006)</ref> The State Legislature signed [[Omaha Public Schools#Split the District|this plan]] into law in April, 2006, with the plan going into effect in 2008.

Within a month of the legislature's passing the law, the [[National Association for the Advancement of Colored People]] brought a [[lawsuit]], arguing that due to Omaha's racially segregated residential patterns, subdivided school districts will also be racially segregated, contrary to [[United States]] [[Brown v. Board of Education|law]].<ref>{{cite news | author=Sam Dillon | title=Schools Plan in Nebraska Is Challenged | publisher=New York Times | date=May 17 2006 | url=http://www.nytimes.com/2006/05/17/us/17naacp.html }}</ref> The case has also drawn national attention.

In October the ''[[Omaha World-Herald]]'' noted recent census statistics showed that Omaha, the 43rd largest city in the United States, has the fifth highest poverty rate for African Americans among the 100 largest cities.
