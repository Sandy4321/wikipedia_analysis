'''Trellis quantization''' is an algorithm that can improve [[data compression]] in [[Discrete cosine transform|DCT]]-based encoding methods.  It is used to optimize residual [[DCT]] coefficients after [[Motion_compensation#Motion_estimation|motion estimation]] in [[lossy compression|lossy]] video compression encoders such as [[Xvid]] and [[x264]].  [[Trellis]] quantization reduces the size of some DCT coefficients while recovering others to take their place.  This process can increase quality because coefficients chosen by Trellis have the lowest [[Rate_distortion|rate-distortion]] ratio.  Trellis quantization effectively finds the optimal quantization for each [[block]] to maximize the [[PSNR]] relative to [[bitrate]].  It has varying effectiveness depending on the input data and compression method.
