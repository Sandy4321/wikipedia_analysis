'''David Michael Sisler''' (October 16, 1931 <U+2013>&nbsp;January 9, 2011) was a professional [[baseball]] [[pitcher]] who played in [[Major League Baseball]]&nbsp;(MLB) from {{By|1956}} through {{By|1962}}. Early in his career, Sisler was a [[starting pitcher|starter]], then later was used as a [[middle relief pitcher|middle reliever]] and occasionally as a [[Closer (baseball)|closer]]. He reached the majors in {{By|1956}}&nbsp;with the [[Boston Red Sox]] after he completed a two year obligation in the active military. After three-and-a-half seasons with the Red Sox, he was traded to the [[Detroit Tigers]] in {{By|1959}} and served the team through the {{By|1960}}&nbsp;season.  Before the {{By|1961}}&nbsp;season, he was selected by the [[Texas Rangers (baseball)|Washington Senators]] in the [[1960 Major League Baseball expansion draft]], for whom he played the {{By|1961}}&nbsp;season. He was then traded to the [[Cincinnati Reds]] in {{By|1962}}, playing one season at the major league level, and one in their [[minor league baseball|minor league]] system.  

His most productive years came with Boston, where he won 24&nbsp;games from 1956 to 1958, averaging 138&nbsp;[[innings pitched|innings]] each season. After that, he appeared strictly as a reliever and [[save (baseball)|saved]] a career-high 11&nbsp;games for the Senators. In a seven-season career, Sisler posted a 38<U+2013>44&nbsp; record with a 4.33&nbsp;[[earned run average|ERA]] in 247&nbsp;appearances, including 29&nbsp;saves, 12&nbsp;[[complete game]]s, one [[shutout]] and 656<U+2153>&nbsp;innings. Sisler retired from baseball after the 1963&nbsp; season to become an investment firm executive, a career that lated for over 30&nbsp;years, retiring as a vice-chairman for [[A. G. Edwards]].

His father, [[National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum|Hall of Famer]] [[George Sisler]], and one of his brothers, [[Dick Sisler]] also played baseball at the major league level; while another brother, [[George Sisler, Jr.]], was a [[general manager (baseball)|general manager]] for several minor league baseball teams, and later became president of the [[International League]] from 1966 to 1976.

===Cincinnati Reds===
The Reds were the NL champions in 1961, and with the addition of Sisler, [[Dave Hillman]], and [[Moe Drabowski]] to ensure stability to their pitching staff in 1962, the team's management had high hopes of a return to the [[World Series]].<ref name=pilotreturn>{{cite news|last=Hutchinson|first=Fred|title=Cincy Pilot: Team Can Repeat|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=u7ctAAAAIBAJ&sjid=VoAFAAAAIBAJ&pg=5285,3197602&dq=sisler+reds+1962&hl=en|accessdate=February 13, 2011|newspaper=Associated Press|date=February 20, 1962}}</ref> Sisler, who was expected to be used as a relief pitcher, joined a Reds team that already had his brother [[Dick Sisler|Dick]], who was their first base [[Coach (baseball)|coach]].<ref name=sislersteam>{{cite news|title=Sisler With Champs|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=2BMrAAAAIBAJ&sjid=SZwFAAAAIBAJ&pg=5259,3831109&dq=sisler+reds+1962&hl=en|accessdate=February 13, 2011|newspaper=Associated Press|date=March 11, 1962}}</ref>  His father, still with Pittsburgh, mentioned that he was relieved that his son did not play in a recent series between the Pirates and Reds, recalling how the mixed emotions he felt when his elder son, Dick, helped defeat the Dodgers in an important game in 1950 by hitting a [[home run]].<ref name=georgeglad>{{cite news|title=George Sisler Glad His Son Wasn't Asked to Relieve Against Bucs|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=OrhdAAAAIBAJ&sjid=_V0NAAAAIBAJ&pg=2838,3956867&dq=sisler+reds+1962&hl=en|accessdate=February 13, 2011|newspaper=United Press International|date=May 24, 1962}}</ref> The younger Sisler's season did not begin well; in his ten appearances by June 5, he allowed a run in all but three, and had a 4.97 ERA.<ref name=1962log>{{cite web|title=The 1962 CIN N Regular Season Pitching Log for Dave Sisler|url=http://www.retrosheet.org/boxesetc/1962/Ksisld1020081962.htm|work=retrosheet.org|publisher=Retrosheet, Inc|accessdate=February 13, 2011}}</ref> On June&nbsp;19, Sisler pitched a scoreless inning in victory against the Pirates, the time first time George watched his son pitch as an opponent.<ref name=sislerhenryfinish>{{cite news|last=Hernon|first=Jack|title=Sisler Henry Finish|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=8sMwAAAAIBAJ&sjid=LGwDAAAAIBAJ&pg=6924,2762017&dq=sisler+reds+1962&hl=en|accessdate=February 13, 2011|newspaper=[[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]]|date=June 20, 1962}}</ref> Although Sisler's season was a disappointment, he completed the season well, allowing just one earned run over the course of his final eight games, as well as earning the victory on September&nbsp;23, his final major league appearance.<ref name=retrosisler/><ref name=1962log/> His totals for the season  included a 4<U+2013>3&nbsp;record, a 3.92&nbsp;ERA, and one save in 43<U+2154>&nbsp;innings pitched.<ref name=retrosisler/>

==Later life==
After his baseball career, Sisler became an executive with the investment firm [[A. G. Edwards]] for more than 30&nbsp;years, reaching the level of vice-chairman.<ref name=globesisler/> A. G. Edwards was a sponsor of a [[semi-professional]] baseball team located in [[St. Petersburg, Florida]]; when the "Stockbrokers" were invited to play in season-ending tournament to decide a champion, Sisler, a senior exectutive, for the firm denied the funding for the team, forcing them to decline if no other monies were raised. It was an unexpected decision considering that Sisler was former baseball player, but he didn't feel that A. G. Edwards was benefitting, with the costs of running the team becoming more than originally agreed to by contract.<ref name=agnopay>{{cite news|last=Flori|first=Bob|title=Stockbrokers Off Market?|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=ZcFaAAAAIBAJ&sjid=dlcDAAAAIBAJ&pg=4869,7001996&dq=dave-sisler&hl=en|accessdate=February 13, 2011|newspaper=[[Evening Independent]]|date=August 28, 1971}}</ref>

In 2004, the possibility arose of his father's record of 257&nbsp;hits in a season being surpassed by [[Ichiro Suzuki]] of the [[Seattle Mariners]]. Living in [[Dallas, Texas]] at the time, Sisler and his son Dave followed Ichiro's progress throughout the season. Both had mixed feelings about the record chase; they were happy that George Sisler's name was being talked about and that people were re-discovering him as a player, but both were hoping that, if the record was not broken in 154&nbsp;games, there would be an [[asterisk]] noting that it took Ichiro more games to achieve it.<ref name=sislerrecord>{{cite news|title=Ichiro has Sisler's Name Prominent Again|url=http://nbcsports.msnbc.com/id/6135407/|accessdate=February 13, 2011|newspaper=Associated Press|date=September 20, 2004}}</ref> Ichiro finished the season with 262&nbsp;hits, and the Mariners extended an invitation for the entire Sisler family to attend the celebration at [[Safeco Field]]. Although just the younger Sisler was able to travel to Seattle, both remarked that the Mariners were a classy organization for extending the invitation.<ref name=sislerrecord/>  Sisler died on January&nbsp;9, 2011 of [[prostate cancer]] at the age of 79 in [[St. Louis, Missouri]].<ref name=apsislerdeath/> He was survived by his wife Janet, son and three grandchildren.<ref name=globesisler/>
