Williams was elected to the Manitoba legislature in the [[Manitoba general election, 1958|1958 provincial election]], in the sprawling northern constituency of [[Churchill (Manitoba riding)|Churchill]].  He defeated [[Manitoba Liberal Party|Liberal-Progressive]] candidate [[K.D. Wray]] by 297 votes, in a poll that was deferred until after the rest of the province had voted.  The Progressive Conservatives won a [[minority government]] in this election, and Williams became a backbench supporter of [[Dufferin Roblin]]'s government.

He did not seek re-election in 1959. He later went on to become President of the Churchill Chamber of Commerce and obtained brief fame by appearing on the CBC National News suggesting that Churchill would be much better off as part of the federally governed Northwest Territories.  He subsequently became Director of Industrial Development for the Mackenzie District of the NWT and then worked with the Department of Indian and Northern Affairs until his retirement in 1983.  He now lives in Nanaimo, BC.
