'''Sir Charles Edward Inglis''', [[Officer of the Order of the British Empire|OBE]], [[Fellow of the Royal Society|FRS]] (pronounced Ingels)<ref name="bridge">{{cite news|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080925080156/http://www.basingstoke-canal.org.uk/bcnews190.htm|work=Basingstoke Canal News|title=Inglis Bridge, Aldershot|volume=190|archivedate=25 September 2008|year=2001|url=http://basingstoke-canal.org.uk/bcnews190.htm}}</ref> (31 July 1875&nbsp;<U+2013> 19 April 1952) was a British [[civil engineer]].  The son of a doctor, he was educated at [[Cheltenham College]] and won a scholarship to [[King's College, Cambridge]], where he would later forge a career as an academic.  Inglis spent a two-year period with the engineering firm run by [[John Wolfe-Barry]] before he returned to King's College as a lecturer.  Working with Professors [[James Alfred Ewing]] and [[Bertram Hopkinson]], he made several important studies into the effects of vibration on structures and defects on the strength of plate steel.

Inglis served in the [[Royal Engineers]] during the First World War and invented the Inglis Bridge, a reusable steel bridging system&nbsp;<U+2013> the precursor to the more famous [[Bailey bridge]] of the Second World War. In 1916 he was placed in charge of bridge design and supply at the [[War Office]] and, with [[Giffard Le Quesne Martel]], pioneered the use of temporary bridges with tanks.  Inglis retired from military service in 1919 and was appointed an [[Officer of the Order of the British Empire]].  He returned to Cambridge University after the war as a professor and head of the [[Cambridge University Engineering Department|Engineering Department]].  Under his leadership, the department became the largest in the university and one of the best regarded engineering schools in the world.  Inglis retired from the department in 1943.

Inglis was associated with the [[Institution of Naval Architects]], [[Institution of Civil Engineers]], [[Institution of Mechanical Engineers]], [[Institution of Structural Engineers]], Institution of Waterworks Engineers and British Waterworks Association; he sat on several of their councils and was elected the Institution of Civil Engineers' president for the 1941<U+2013>42 session. He was also a [[fellow of the Royal Society]].  Inglis sat on the [[Public inquiry|board of inquiry]] looking into the [[R101 airship]]'s loss and was chair of a [[Ministry of War Transport]] railway modernisation committee in 1946.  Knighted in 1945, he spent his later years developing his theories on the education of engineers and wrote a textbook on [[applied mechanics]].  He has been described as the greatest teacher of engineering of his time and has a building named in his honour at Cambridge University.

== Early life and career ==
Charles Inglis was the second son of Dr. Alexander Inglis (a [[general practitioner]] in [[Worcester]]) and his first wife, Florence, the daughter of newspaper proprietor [[John Frederick Feeney]].<ref name=ODNB>{{harvnb|Baker|2004}}</ref>  Alexander Inglis was born in Scotland to a respectable family&nbsp;<U+2013>  his grandfather, [[John Inglis (admiral)|John Inglis]], was an Admiral in the [[Royal Navy]] and had captained [[HMS Belliqueux (1780)|HMS ''Belliqueux'']] at the [[Battle of Camperdown]] in 1797.<ref name="baker445"/>

Charles Inglis was born on 31 July 1875. He was not expected to survive and was hurriedly baptised in his father's drawing room; his mother died from complications eleven days later.<ref name="baker445">{{harvnb|Baker|1953|p=445}}</ref>  His family moved to Cheltenham and Inglis was schooled at [[Cheltenham College]] from 1889 to 1894. In his final year, he was elected [[head boy]] and received a scholarship to study the [[Mathematics Tripos]] at [[King's College, Cambridge]].<ref name="baker446">{{harvnb|Baker|1953|p=446}}</ref><ref name=venn>{{harvnb|Venn & Venn|1922<U+2013>1958}}</ref> Inglis was [[Wrangler (University of Cambridge)|22nd wrangler]]{{#tag:ref|At Cambridge students of the mathematics tripos are graded by exam results into three groups.  The top performing students were known as "wranglers" with lower achieving students known as "senior optimes" and "junior optimes", in a similar manner to the current [[British undergraduate degree classification|British undergraduate degree classification system]].  The top scoring student was known as the "[[senior wrangler]]" with the other wranglers being named for their position within the class. Thus Inglis achieved the twenty-second highest mark in the mathematics tripos of 1897.  Students ceased to be ranked within the classes after 1909.<ref>{{harvnb|Forfar|1996}}</ref>|group=nb}} when he received his [[Bachelor of Arts]] degree in 1897; he remained for a fourth year, achieving [[first class honours]] in Mechanical Sciences.<ref name=venn/><ref name=parade>{{cite web|title=Spring 2005|url=http://www.kings.cam.ac.uk/files/news/kp-2005-spring.pdf|work=King's Parade|publisher=King's College, Cambridge|accessdate=5 March 2012|format=PDF|year=2005}}</ref>  Inglis was a keen sportsman and enjoyed long distance running, walking, mountaineering and sailing. At Cambridge, he nearly achieved a [[Blue (university sport)|blue]] for long distance running but was forced to withdraw from a significant race because of a pulled muscle.<ref name="baker446"/> He was also a follower of the [[Cambridge University R.U.F.C.|Cambridge University Rugby Union team]], watching their matches at [[Grange Road, Cambridge|Grange Road]].<ref name="baker456">{{harvnb|Baker|1953|p=456}}</ref>

After graduation, Inglis began work as an apprentice for the civil engineering firm of [[John Wolfe-Barry|John Wolfe-Barry & Partners]].<ref name=ODNB/><ref name="baker446"/>  He worked as a [[draughtsman]] in the drawing office for several months before being placed with [[Alexander Gibb]], who was acting as resident engineer on an extension to the [[District Railway|Metropolitan District Railway]] between [[Whitechapel]] and [[Bow, London|Bow]].<ref name=ODNB/><ref name="baker446"/> Inglis was responsible for the design and supervision of all thirteen bridges on the route.<ref name=ODNB/><ref name=parade/><ref name="baker447">{{harvnb|Baker|1953|p=447}}</ref>  It was during this time that he began his lifelong study of vibration and its effects on materials, particularly bridges.<ref name=ODNB/>

== Early academic career ==
In 1901 Inglis was made a [[fellow]] of King's College after writing a thesis entitled ''The Balancing of Engines'', the first general treatment of [[engine balance|the subject]]&nbsp;<U+2013> which was becoming increasingly important due to the growing speeds of locomotives.<ref name=ODNB/><ref name="baker447"/> In the same year, he received his [[Master of Arts (Oxbridge and Dublin)|Master of Arts]] degree and was accepted as an [[Institution of Civil Engineers]] (ICE) associate member after winning the institution's Miller Prize for his student paper on ''The Geometrical Methods in Investigating Mechanical Problems''.<ref name=ODNB/><ref name=venn/><ref name=ice/>  Inglis left his employment with Wolfe-Barry, having completed two years of his five-year apprenticeship, to return to King's College and become an assistant to [[James Alfred Ewing]], professor of mechanism and applied mechanics.<ref name=ODNB/><ref name=venn/><ref>{{harvnb|Divall|1990|p=86}}</ref>  Inglis maintained his interest in engine balancing and filed a US patent on 16 April 1902 for an improved engine with the [[Cylinder (locomotive)|cylinders]] mounted end to end to balance out the forces acting between them.<ref>{{cite web|title=US Patent 712067|url=http://www.google.pt/patents/US712067|publisher=US Patent Office|accessdate=16 February 2013|year=1902}}</ref>

Professor Ewing left the university in 1903 to become the first Director of Naval Education at the [[Admiralty]] but Inglis remained; he was appointed a [[List of academic ranks#United Kingdom|university demonstrator]] in [[Mechanism (engineering)|mechanism]] by Professor [[Bertram Hopkinson]], Ewing's successor, and worked with him to study the effects of vibration.<ref name=ODNB/><ref name=venn/><ref name="baker447"/>  Inglis was promoted to lecturer of mechanical engineering in 1908.<ref name=venn/>  Hopkinson recognised Inglis' academic abilities and assigned him the heaviest teaching load of all the staff, covering statics, dynamics, structural engineering theory, materials engineering, drawing, engine balance and the design of steel girders and reinforced concrete.<ref name=parade/> Inglis later recalled that if he wished to learn more on a subject then he volunteered to teach a course on it.<ref>{{harvnb|Matheson|1963|p=19}}</ref>   From 1911 Inglis became involved in hydraulic engineering and served on the board of the [[Cambridge Water Company|Cambridge University and Town Waterworks Company]], serving as deputy chairman from 1924 to 1928 and chairman from 1928 to 1952.<ref name="baker454">{{harvnb|Baker|1953|p=454}}</ref>

Inglis conducted research into the problem of fracture in the metal plates of ships' hulls and noticed that the [[rivet]] holes along the path of a crack were often deformed into an elliptical shape.<ref name=defect>{{harvnb|Ashbee|2008|p=6599}}</ref>  This phenomenon led him to investigate the magnification of stress caused at the edges of an elliptical defect; in 1913 he published a paper of his theories that has been described as his most important contribution to engineering and the first serious modern work on the fracturing of materials.<ref name="baker449">{{harvnb|Baker|1953|p=449}}</ref><ref name="book">{{harvnb|de With|2006|p=654}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Taplin|Saxina|2011|p=110}}</ref> [[Alan Arnold Griffith]] later drew on Inglis' paper for his work on the [[Griffith's criterion|apparent discrepancy between calculated and actual strengths of materials]].<ref name=ODNB/>  Inglis's 1913 paper has been cited by around 1,200 subsequent works.<ref>{{cite web|title=Inglis:Stresses in a plate due to the presence of cracks and sharp corners|url=http://scholar.google.co.uk/scholar?cites=8886729000108727480&as_sdt=2005&sciodt=0,5&hl=en|publisher=Google Scholar|accessdate=28 February 2013}}</ref>

Inglis had married Eleanor Moffat, daughter of [[Lieutenant-Colonel]] Herbert Moffat of the [[South Wales Borderers]], in 1901, having met on holiday in Switzerland.<ref name="baker447"/>  They lived at Maitland House, [[Cambridge]], until 1904, when Inglis built a house he named Balls Grove at nearby [[Grantchester]], where his two daughters were born and the family resided until 1925.<ref name=ODNB/><ref name="baker447"/>  They later moved to 10 Latham Road, which Inglis renamed Niddrys after the first known address of his ancestors in Edinburgh.<ref name="baker447"/>

== Military service ==
[[File:Inglis bridge patent.png|thumb|An Inglis "pyramid" footbridge variant|alt=A patent drawing showing a footbridge constructed of triangular trusses]]
Inglis was involved with the Cambridge University [[Officer Training Corps]] (CUOTC), being commissioned a [[second lieutenant]] on 24 May 1909.<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=28260|startpage=4576|date=15 June 1909|accessdate=17 April 2008}}</ref>  He served with the CUOTC's engineering detachment and noticed that when the unit was deployed on field days with the rest of the force it often had little to do.<ref name=parade/> To remedy this, Inglis designed a reusable steel bridge, with the intention that it could be erected and dismantled by the unit in a single afternoon.<ref name=parade/>  An army general who was inspecting the unit noticed his design and offered advice: "If you're making anything for the army, keep it simple&nbsp;<U+2013> no complicated gadgets".<ref name=ODNB/><ref name=parade/>  Upon the outbreak of the [[First World War]] in 1914, Inglis volunteered for active service in the [[British Army]] and was officially listed as an Assistant Instructor in the [[Royal School of Military Engineering|School of Military Engineering]], with the temporary rank of [[lieutenant]].<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=28968|supp=yes|startpage=9110|date=6 November 1914|accessdate=17 April 2008}}</ref>  The army expressed interest in Inglis' bridge design; it was approved for use by a panel of army officers that included the general who had first commented on the design, to whom Inglis said "I hope, Sir, you will find I have profited by your advice".<ref name=parade/>  The design remained in service with the British Army until the higher-capacity [[Bailey bridge]] was introduced during the [[Second World War]].<ref name=bailey>{{harvnb|Thierry|1946|p=96}}</ref><ref name=inglisbridge/>

== Return to King's College ==
[[File:Cambridge university dept of engineering.jpg|thumb|The modern Cambridge University Engineering Department which is sited on the former Scroope House acquired for the university by Inglis in 1924|alt=A photograph of a brick building with a sign reading "Cambridge University Engineering Department"]]
Inglis returned to Cambridge in 1918 and was appointed as the professor of Mechanism and Applied Mechanics (renamed Mechanical Sciences in 1934).<ref name=ODNB/><ref name="baker450">{{harvnb|Baker|1953|p=450}}</ref> On 25 March 1919, he was selected to head the [[Cambridge University Engineering Department]] as the successor of Hopkinson, who had died in an air crash the previous year.<ref name="ODNB"/> Though he made no radical changes, such as had occurred under his predecessors, under Inglis' supervision the department became the largest in the university and one of the best engineering schools in the world.<ref name=ODNB/>  He was responsible for expanding the department to meet the increased post-war demand for engineers and for the move from its traditional home at [[Free School Lane]].<ref name="Moullin907">{{harvnb|Moullin|1952|p=907}}</ref>  Inglis acquired the {{convert|4|acre|ha|adj=on}} Scroope House on Trumpington Street for the department and constructed a {{convert|50,000|sqft|sqm|adj=on}} laboratory on the site by 1923, followed in 1931 by a structure containing lecture theatres and a drawing office.<ref name="baker454"/>

At Cambridge Inglis' students included Sir [[Frank Whittle]] (developer of the [[jet engine]]), [[James N.

He once told a new intake class: "Your fathers, gentlemen, have sent you to Cambridge to be educated, not to become engineers. They think, however, that reading engineering is a very good way of becoming educated. In 10 years' time, however, 90% of you will have become managers, whether of design, manufacturing, sales, research or even accounts departments in industry. The remaining 10% of you will have become successful lawyers, novelists, and things of that sort".<ref>{{harvnb|Welbourn|Dixon|1973|p=149}}</ref>  Undeterred, Inglis sought to give his students the broadest possible engineering education, covering all fields to prevent them becoming "cramped by premature specialisation".<ref name="baker454"/>

Inglis was due to retire from the university in 1940, but was persuaded to remain for another three years so that [[John Baker, Baron Baker|John Baker]] could be appointed in his stead.<ref name="cam"/>  Interest in Inglis' army bridge was rekindled in the Second World War and the Mark III design introduced in 1940.<ref name="joiner66"/>  Inglis applied for a United States patent for the particular type of triangular trusses used in his bridge in 1940; which was approved and granted in 1943.<ref>{{cite web|title=US Patent 2329906|url=http://www.google.pt/patents?id=VItwAAAAEBAJ|publisher=US Patent Office|accessdate=11 March 2012|year=1943}}<!-- This may need to be converted to "Cite patent" or similar form, but those appear to lack accessdates and don't do formatting with periods like the other cite templates --></ref>  Testing of a prototype of the Mark III revealed a weakness in the top chord of the truss and the subsequent redesign complicated the production process.<ref name="joiner66"/>  Whilst the bridge was produced in limited quantities from 1940 it was largely replaced by the Bailey bridge, introduced in 1941, a fact that disappointed Inglis.<ref name="baker449"/><ref name=bailey/><ref name="joiner66">{{harvnb|Joiner|2011|p=66}}</ref>  The Inglis design remained in service for some time owing to a lack of resources for production of the Bailey bridge and saw service in rear areas and with the [[1st Canadian Infantry Division]].<ref>{{harvnb|Rawling|1985|p=118}}</ref>

Inglis was elected as ICE president for the 1941<U+2013>42 session, having been vice-president in 1938, and gave an inaugural address on the education of engineers that was judged to be one of the best ever given.<ref name=ice/><ref name="baker453"/><ref name="civils">{{harvnb|Watson|1988|p=253}}</ref>  In his address, he stated that "the soul and spirit of education is that habit of mind which remains when a student has completely forgotten everything he has ever been taught", a quote which has since been used by several organisations to describe the importance of an engineering education.<ref>{{harvnb|Cosgrove|Phillips|Quilligan|2010}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Holmes|1997}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Nethercot|first=David A.|title=What is Civil Engineering?|url=http://www.cv.ic.ac.uk/intranet/Green%20Book%20Website/Welcome.htm|publisher=Imperial College Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering|accessdate=26 March 2012}}</ref>  He delivered the [[Thomas Hawksley]] Lecture on "Gyroscopic Principles and Applications" for the Institution of Mechanical Engineers in 1943 and the fiftieth ICE James Forrest lecture on "Mechanical Vibrations, their Cause and Prevention" in 1944, being awarded the ICE's Charles Parsons medal the same year.<ref name=venn/><ref name=ice/><ref>{{harvnb|Anonymous|1952|p=503}}</ref>  He gave the Parsons Memorial Lecture to the [[Institute of Marine Engineering, Science and Technology|North-East Coast Institution of Engineers and Shipbuilders]] in 1945 in which he presented his Basic Function Method, an alternative to the use of [[Fourier series]] for the analysis of vibrations in beams.<ref name="baker452"/>

After his retirement as department head Inglis served as [[Provost (education)|Vice-Provost]] of King's College from 1943 to 1947.<ref name=venn/>  He received a [[Knight Bachelor|knighthood]] in the 1945 King's Birthday Honours, and in 1946 was appointed as chair of the committee charged with advising the [[Minister of War Transport]] on railway modernisation.<ref name="baker454"/><ref>{{London Gazette|issue=37119|supp=yes|startpage=2933|endpage=2934|date=8 June 1945|accessdate=17 April 2008}}</ref>  Inglis continued to develop his theories on teaching engineering and wrote in the ''Proceedings of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers'' in 1947 on the teaching of engineering mathematics: "Mathematics [required by engineers] though it must be sound and incisive as far as goes, need not be of that artistic and exalted quality which calls for the mentality of the real mathematician.  It can be termed mathematics of the tin-opening variety, and in contrast to real mathematicians, engineers are more interested in the contents of the tin than in the elegance of the tin-opener employed".<ref>{{harvnb|Atkins|2009| p=x}}</ref>  He published the textbook ''Applied Mechanics for Engineers'' in 1951, following which he spent three months as a [[visiting professor]] at the [[University of the Witwatersrand]] in South Africa.<ref name=ODNB/><ref name="baker456"/>  His wife, Lady Eleanor Inglis, died on 1 April 1952, and Charles died eighteen days later at [[Southwold]], Suffolk.<ref name=ODNB /><ref name="baker456"/>  The Cambridge University Engineering Department's Inglis Building is named in his honour.<ref name=cam2/>  Inglis has been described as the greatest teacher of engineering of his time.<ref name="baker455">{{harvnb|Baker|1953|p=455}}</ref><ref name="moullin906">{{harvnb|Moullin|1952|p=906}}</ref>
