''Power Tennis'' incorporates multiple characters, themes, and locations from the [[Mario (series)|''Mario'' series]]. The game includes standard tennis matches, but contains variants such as different scoring formats and objectives.<ref name="manual">{{cite book | year=2005 | editor=Camelot | title=''Mario Power Tennis'' Instruction Manual | pages=20 | publisher=Nintendo|language=English}}</ref> Other variants include "Gimmick" courts, thematic courts with components and properties that directly affect gameplay. The game features 18 playable characters, each categorised by their style of play and each with a pair of unique moves known as "Power Shots".<ref name="Gamespot review"/> ''Power Tennis'' was developed simultaneously with ''[[Mario Golf: Toadstool Tour]]'', which shared similar technology and concepts with the tennis game during production.<ref name="IGN interview"/> Such similarities include an emphasis on the ''Mario'' theme in characters and settings as well as alternative game modes such as "Ring Shot".

The game was positively received in general, attaining an aggregate score of 81 percent from [[Game Rankings]].<ref name="Mario Power Tennis media rankings"/> Critics praised the game's depth and variety, but criticised the "Power Shot" animations, which could not be skipped.<ref name="Gamespot review"/>

==Gameplay==
[[Image:Mario Power Tennis.jpg|thumb|left|[[List of Mario series characters#Petey Piranha|Petey Piranha]] in the "Tic-Tac-Glow" Special Game]]
''Mario Power Tennis'' features variations of tennis matches consisting of characters, courts, and scenarios based on the [[Mario (series)|''Mario'' series]]. The range of courts includes the standard three [[Tennis court#Types of tennis courts|types of tennis court]], but consists predominantly of those themed upon games in the ''Mario'' series, known as "Gimmick" courts. As well as adopting the style aesthetically, these feature thematic elements that influence how the match will be played on that surface, such as the ghosts in the ''[[Luigi's Mansion]]'' court, which hinder movement when the character comes into physical contact with them.<ref name="Gamespot review"/> Although standard tennis is available, variants of the sport can be played which adopt different rules and methods of victory. "Ring Shot" involves the player earning points by hitting the ball through rings of varying sizes, with the number of points dependent on the difficulty of the shot.<ref>{{cite book | year=2005 | editor=Camelot | title=''Mario Power Tennis'' Instruction Manual | pages=21 | publisher=Nintendo|language=English}}</ref> The player acquires the points whenever a winning shot is made adhering to standard rules; the match is won once the predetermined number of points is equalled or surpassed. A similar mode, "Item Battle", involves the characters using items based on the ''Mario'' universe to interfere with each other's game and gain an advantage.<ref name="manual"/>

The central mode of the game is "Tournament mode", which comprises a set of events with accumulating difficulty. These set of events must be finished successfully to unlock playable characters. This mode can be completed either in "doubles" or "singles", and is divided into "Gimmick" courts and standard courts.<ref name="Eurogamer review"/> An alternative to these are "Special Games", which involve the player trying to meet a tennis-related objective on a "Gimmick" court. These Special Games come in multiple forms, incorporating themes from past Nintendo games, such as "Tic-Tac-Glow", which requires the player to hit balls of water to liberate [[Super Mario Sunshine#Shine Sprites|Shine Sprites]] trapped in dirt,<ref>{{cite book | year=2005 | editor=Camelot | title=''Mario Power Tennis'' Instruction Manual | pages=23 | publisher=Nintendo|language=English}}</ref> a reference to ''[[Super Mario Sunshine]]''. ''Power Tennis'' supports four-player [[multiplayer video game|multiplayer]], which can be accessed during "Exhibition mode",<ref name="Eurogamer review"/> the standard mode of play where the player can choose his or her opponents and the conditions of the match. Such options include the difficulty of the opponent, the court used, and the number of games and sets required to win the match.

''Power Tennis'' features [[Mario Tennis (series)#Playable characters|18 playable characters]], all of whom derive from the ''Mario'' franchise. Many characters, such as [[Wario]], had already appeared in the game's predecessor and several other ''Mario'' [[spin-off]]s, while this was the first appearance for [[List of Mario series enemies#Wiggler|Wiggler]] as a playable characters. All of the characters are categorised into six groups that reflect their playing style: all-around, technical, power, speed, defensive, and tricky.<ref>{{cite book | year=2005 | editor=Camelot | title=''Mario Power Tennis'' Instruction Manual | pages=29 &ndash; 33 | publisher=Nintendo|language=English}}</ref> Inherent in each character is also a set of two unique moves known as "power shots", with one being offensive and the other defensive.<ref name="Gamespot review"/> These powerful moves, which are accompanied with an animation each time they are triggered, incorporate the character's specific qualities. They can only be triggered occasionally in the match, but will usually result in defending or scoring a point, depending on the type of shot chosen. Generic tennis moves, such as slices, dropshots and lobs can be applied any time in the match.<ref name="Gamespot review"/>

==Development==
''Power Tennis'' was developed by [[Camelot Software Planning]], with a team consisting of approximately 30 people, headed by Hiroyuki and Shugo Takahashi.<ref name="IGN interview">{{cite web|url=http://uk.cube.ign.com/articles/570/570491p1.html|title=Camelot talks Mario Power Tennis|publisher=[[IGN]]|date=2004-12-02|accessdate=2008-07-07}}</ref> The game was first unveiled in a 2002 issue of the Japanese magazine ''[[Famitsu]]'',<ref name="Unveiled">{{cite web|url=http://uk.cube.ign.com/articles/355/355026p1.html|title=Mario Tennis and golf announced|publisher=[[IGN]]|date=2002-03-06|accessdate=2008-07-07}}</ref> and was later presented at the [[E3]] conference of 2004. Before release, the brothers discussed multiple developmental processes in an interview with ''Famitsu''. Apparently, Camelot had been working on a previous GameCube version of ''Mario Tennis'', but discontinued the project and began again using ideas and technology used for ''[[Mario Golf: Toadstool Tour]]'', which was being developed simultaneously with the game.<ref name="IGN interview">{{cite web|url=http://uk.cube.ign.com/articles/570/570491p1.html|title=Camelot talks Mario Power Tennis|publisher=[[IGN]]|date=2004-12-02|accessdate=2008-07-07}}</ref> Shugo Takahashi noted that the original would have been more serious and contained deeper gameplay, but with fewer "Mario-esque" gimmicks. Also accounting for the delay of release was a willingness not to update the graphics only without exploring advancements to concepts and gameplay, which Hiroyuki stated would be "unacceptable for a ''Mario'' game". Due to the success of its predecessor, the brothers felt pressure to make a game that was original, and would not appear too similar to its predecessor on first sight.<ref name="Interview">{{cite web|url=http://uk.cube.ign.com/articles/533/533525p1.html|title=Mario Tennis Update|publisher=[[IGN]]|date=2004-07-26|accessdate=2008-07-07}}</ref>

Following release, IGN interviewed Hiroyuki Takahashi regarding the development of the game. Takahashi revealed that Camelot had received co-operation from Nintendo in relation to voice acting and animation, which Takahashi stated as "contributing quite a bit to the improvement of the game's graphics". Takahashi proceeded to explain why the [[role-playing game (video games)|role-playing game]] elements that were present in ''[[Mario Tennis (handheld game)|Mario Tennis]]'' were excluded from ''Power Tennis'', stating that he felt they were more suitable for the "deep single-player experience" present in portable consoles. Regarding the themed courts in the game, he explained that the concepts were conceived during long brainstorming sessions, with courts selected that would both remind gamers of older ''Mario'' games and introduce new gamers to ''Mario'' games they may not have played. When questioned about difficulties noting the game, Takahashi noted the effort used in making the opening sequences, developing the special games, and animations, which caused problems with meeting the schedule. Although there was speculation about online capabilities before release,<ref name="Online?">{{cite web|url=http://uk.cube.ign.com/articles/526/526108p1.html|title=Mario Tennis Connected|publisher=[[IGN]]|date=2004-07-24|accessdate=2008-07-07}}</ref> Takahashi refrained from making the game online-compatible due to fear of [[lagging]] problems, stating "I don't think you can play a tennis game online under the current Internet environment and feel satisfied".<ref name="IGN interview">{{cite web|url=http://uk.cube.ign.com/articles/570/570491p1.html|title=Camelot talks Mario Power Tennis|publisher=[[IGN]]|date=2004-12-02|accessdate=2008-07-07}}</ref>

Nintendo collaborated with the [[Lawn Tennis Association]] in 2005 to promote ''Power Tennis'' in the [[United Kingdom]]. The promotion featured on-site sampling and official Nintendo branding at various tennis events such as [[The Championships, Wimbledon|Wimbledon]]. The LTA's ''ACE Magazine'' advertised ''Power Tennis'' and featured competitions offering the game as a prize.<ref name="Wimbledon">{{cite web|url=http://www.nintendoworldreport.com/newsArt.cfm?artid=10315|title=Nintendo Teams Up With Lawn Tennis Association|publisher=[[Nintendo World Report]]|date=2005-02-18|accessdate=2008-08-24|first=Jonathan|last=Metts}}</ref> Nintendo also released an online questionnaire regarding players' habits and preferences in relation to tennis as a part of their ''Who Are You?'' campaign.<ref name="quiz">{{cite web|url=http://uk.cube.ign.com/articles/561/561049p1.html|title=Mario Power Tennis Quiz|publisher=[[IGN]]|date=2004-10-27|accessdate=2008-07-07}}</ref>
