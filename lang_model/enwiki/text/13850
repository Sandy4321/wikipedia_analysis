The '''Jeita Grotto''' ({{lang-ar|<U+0645><U+063A><U+0627><U+0631><U+0629> <U+062C><U+0639><U+064A><U+062A><U+0627>}}) is a compound of interconnected [[Karst topography|karstic]] [[limestone]] [[cave]]s in [[Lebanon]] located {{convert|18|km|mi}} north of [[Beirut]] in the Valley of [[Nahr al-Kalb]].  The complex consists of two separate caves. 
<br />

The lower cave was inhabited in prehistoric times, it was   rediscovered in 1836 by Reverend William Thomson; it can only be visited by boat since it channels an [[Subterranean river|underground river]] which provides fresh drinking water for the inhabitants of [[Beirut]].
<br />

The upper cave was discovered in 1958 by Lebanese speleologists, it is located {{convert|60|m|ft}} above the lower cave and has been accommodated with an access tunnel and a series of walkways to enable tourists visit it safely without disturbing the [[natural landscape]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://archnet.org/library/sites/one-site.tcl?site_id=75|title=Jeita Grotto|publisher=archnet|accessdate=2007-07-31}}</ref>.  The upper cave houses the world's largest [[stalactite]] and is made of a series of chambers the largest of which has a maximum height of {{convert|120|m|ft}}.
<br />

The Jeita Grotto which is managed by the German, Beirut based private firm MAPAS is a candidate in the [[New7Wonders of Nature|New 7 Wonders of Nature]] competition.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.new7wonders.com/nature/en/liveranking/|title=new7wonders |publisher=|accessdate=2007-07-31}}</ref>


==History==
The Jeita caves have been inhabited since prehistoric times.<ref name ="vid2" /> Ancient vestiges of a foundry were found in a one smaller cave nearby the Nahr al-Kalb river which suggests that this cave was used in prehistory to produce swords.<ref name ="destination" />

The modern discovery of the underground river of Jeita in 1836 is credited to Reverend William Thomson (an American missionary) who ventured some {{convert|50|m|ft}} into the cave. Reaching the underground river, he fired a shot from his gun and the resulting echoes convinced him that he had found a cavern of major importance.<br />
In 1873 W.J. Maxwell and H.G. Huxley, engineers with the Beirut Water Company, and their friend Reverend [[Daniel Bliss]], president of the [[American University of Beirut|Syrian Protestant College]] (later the [[American University of Beirut]]) explored these caverns. In two expeditions carried out in 1873 and 1874 they penetrated {{convert|1060|m|ft}}  into the grotto which is the principal source of the Nahr el-Kalb that supplies Beirut with water. They were impeded by "Hell's Rapids" torrents which break onto razor sharp rocks.
Dr. Bliss, Mr. Maxwell and the other engineers recorded their names and the year on "Maxwell's Column", a great limestone pillar some {{convert|625|m|ft}} from the entrance.
About {{convert|200|m|ft}} further on, in the so-called "[[Pantheon, Rome|Pantheon]]", they wrote their names and details of the expedition on paper, sealed it in a bottle and placed it on top of a stalagmite. The lime-impregnated water has since covered the bottle with a thin white film, permanently fixing it to the stone.<br /> 
Between 1892 and 1940 further expeditions were carried out by English, American and French explorers. Their expeditions brought them to a depth of {{convert|1750|m|ft}}.<br />
Since the 1940s, Lebanese explorers, notably the members of the Speleo-Club of Lebanon (Lebanese Caving Club) founded in 1951 by the first Lebanese speleologist Lionel Ghorra,<ref name = "speleoclub" >{{cite web |url=http://www.speleoliban.com/history.htm|title=Sp<U+00E9>l<U+00E9>o Club du Liban - History|publisher=SPL|accessdate=2008-06-11}}</ref> have pushed even deeper into the Jeita grotto.

In 1958 the lower caverns were opened to the public, meanwhile exploration was still underway mainly by the Lebanese Caving Club which led to the discovery of the elevated dry branch of the grotto later referred to as the upper galleries.<ref name = "scave"/>

In 1962, the Sp<U+00E9>l<U+00E9>o Club contributed to a study of the upper galleries aiming to provide a tunnel course which was to be dug for touristic development purposes; this tunnel was begun in 1968.<ref name = "speleoclub"/>

In 1969, a concert with electronic music by the [[France|French]] composer [[Fran<U+00E7>ois Bayle|Francois Bayle]] was held in the cave to celebrate the inauguration of the upper galleries. This event was organized by the Lebanese artist and sculptor Ghassan Klink.<ref name = "tf" >{{cite web |url=http://www.tripsfinder.net/trips/?p=611|title=Jeita Cave <U+201C>Lebanon<U+201D>|publisher=|accessdate=2008-06-11}}</ref> Other cultural events have taken place in this unusual surrounding, including a concert by the world acknowledged [[Germany|German]] composer [[Karlheinz Stockhausen]] in November 1969.<ref name = vid>{{cite video | people =Anne-Marie Deshayes | title = Stockhausen in den H<U+00F6>hlen von Jeita (Stockhausen in the caves of Jeita) | medium = DVD | publisher = MIDEM | location = Jeita, Lebanon | year2 = 1969}}</ref>

==Geology==
[[Image:Jeitag3.jpg|thumb|220px|Lower cave at Jeita.]]
The Jeita grotto is located within the Lower-Middle [[Jurassic]] strata of Keserouane which has a stratigraphic thickness of {{convert|1000|m|ft}} and consists of [[dolostone]] and [[micrite|micritic]] [[limestone]].<ref name = "study"/><ref name = "geo "/><ref name="strat">{{cite web |url=http://www.geocities.com/capecanaveral/5109/Strat.htm |title=STRATIGRAPHY OF LEBANON |accessdate=2008-06-16 |format= |work=}}</ref> The Keserouane formation was exposed to air by a local [[Tectonic uplift|uplift]] during  the Late Jurassic-Early [[Cretaceous]]. The Keserouane strata became karstified after its aerial exposure and then was buried during the [[Cretaceous]]. In the [[Neogene]], upon the final uplift of Mount Lebanon, this early karstification phase was reactivated.<br />
At the Nahr el Kalb valley, the impervious Upper Jurassic volcanic rocks and Lower Cretaceous sand slant almost vertically forming a hydrogeological barrier and forcing the outlet of the Jeita underground river to the surface. This barrier could be the reason for the westernmost, large cave chambers with heights exceeding {{convert|60|m|ft}}. Karstification of the Keserouane limestone was further intensified by the steep topography of the area and the volume of precipitation over the Lebanon (more than 1200mm).<ref name = "geo ">{{cite paper  | first = El Nawwar | last = Sandrine | author = El Nawwar, Sandrine | authorlink =  | coauthors = Nader, Fadi | title = THE JEITA CAVE (LEBANON): AN EXAMPLE OF SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT OF A TYPICAL KARSTIC RESOURCE  | version = | publisher = IKS | date =  | url = http://www.zrc-sazu.si/iks/sola%2006/14th%20IKS-abstracts.pdf | format =.pdf | accessdate =2008-06-12 }}</ref>


A ratio of total slope gradient of 1/100 is calculated between the entrance of the cave and its inland extremity. This shows its smooth flat course even though it is sometimes interrupted by several small cascades and rapids. From the west, the Jeita cave starts with large halls and [[meander]]s. Through some rapids, the dimension becomes narrower. Going forth, it is spacious with the Thompson<U+2019>s cavern ({{convert|250|m|ft}} long and {{convert|60|m|ft}} wide), Grand Chaos {{convert|500|m|ft}} long) and Mroueh<U+2019>s Hall ({{convert|200|m|ft}} long and {{convert|50|m|ft}} wide). The latter two are floored with collapsed blocks. The cave ends with a Y-shaped pattern, where, each branch ends with a [[siphon]].<ref name="geo"/>

The Jeita cave is situated at the center of the western flanks of the Lebanon mountains, its natural entrance is about {{convert|100|m|ft}} above sea level. It's located {{convert|5|km|mi}} east of the Mediterranean coastline and {{convert|18|km|mi}} north of Beirut.<ref name = "study" >{{Cite journal | last = Verheyden | first = Sophie | coauthors = Fadi Nader, Hai Cheng, Lawrence Edwards , Rudy Swennen | title = Paleoclimate reconstruction in the Levant region from the geochemistry of a Holocene stalagmite from the Jeita cave, Lebanon | accessdate = 2009-03-09 | url = https://lirias.kuleuven.be/bitstream/123456789/214347/1/ST-QR+paper.pdf }}</ref>
The Jeita caves are solutional karst caves which have formed over millions of years due to the dissolution of limestone. The limestone is dissolved by carbonic acid charged rain water and groundwater;<ref name = "AC" >{{cite web |url=http://www.amazingcaves.com/learn_formed.html|title=Journey into amazing caves|publisher=|accessdate=2008-06-10}}</ref> when the limestone, which is originally water proof, contains cracks produced by tectonic forces the water oozes into the rock and starts to widen the cracks and solute caves inside the layers.<ref name = "karst" >{{cite web |url=http://www.showcaves.com/english/explain/Speleology/Karst.html|title=Karst caves| last =Duckeck| first = Jochen| date = 6 January 2008|accessdate=2008-06-11}}</ref> Jeita is the longest cave complex in the Middle East;<ref name = "geotimes" >{{citation |url=http://www.geotimes.org/dec04/Travels1204.html |last = Krieger | first = Kimberly |title=Lebanon's limestone: Where the mountains meet the sea  |publisher= Geotimes|accessdate=2008-06-10}}</ref>, it sits at {{convert|300|m|ft}} above sea level and has a height difference of {{convert|305|m|ft}}.<ref name = "scave"/>  Geologically, the caves provide a tunnel or escape route for the underground river, which is the principal source of Nahr-el-Kalb.<ref name = "atlas"/>

===Upper cave===
The Jeita upper cave has an overall length of {{convert|2130|m|ft}} of which only {{convert|750|m|ft}} are accessible to visitors via a specially conceived walkway; access to the remainder of the cave was restricted to prevent ecological damage which may occur due to the flocking tourists. The upper cave contains a great concentration of a variety of crystallized formations such as stalactites, [[stalagmite]]s, columns, mushrooms, ponds, curtains and draperies.<ref name = "official" >{{cite web|url=http://www.jeitagrotto.com/siteE.html|title=Jeita Grotto|publisher=|accessdate=2008-06-10}}</ref> The upper gallery is famous for its formations, lit by an effective lighting system. It is entered through a {{convert|117|m|ft}} long concrete tunnel. The part accessible by visitors has three huge chambers. The first is called White Chamber, the second Red Chamber, due to the color of the formations.
White dripstones are pure calcite without defilement, the red color is given by iron oxide (rust) in small amounts. In Lebanon iron oxide has a red color instead of the brown beige color which is common in northern countries. The reason is a different chemical reaction caused by the high temperature which produces a different kind of iron oxide.
The White Chamber is medium sized, but has the most impressive formations of the cave. The Red Chamber is up to {{convert|106|m|ft}} high, and {{convert|30|m|ft}} to {{convert|50|m|ft}} wide. The third chamber is the biggest of all three chambers and has a height of more than {{convert|120|m|ft}}.<ref name="tf"/> The longest stalactite in the world is located in Jeita's White Chamber; it measures {{convert|8.2|m|ft}} long.<ref name = "scave1" >{{cite web |url=http://www.showcaves.com/english/explain/Statistics/Stalactites.html|title=Caves With The Longest Stalactite| last =Duckeck| first = Jochen| date = 6 January 2008 |publisher=|accessdate=2008-06-11}}</ref><ref name="long">{{Cite web|url=http://www.buzzle.com/articles/lebanons-jeita-grotto.html|title=Lebanon's Jeita Grotto|accessdate=2008-07-17|year=2008|author=Cedric Canierro|format=.HTML|language=English}}</ref>

==Economic and social importance==

Today, the Jeita Grotto is a popular recreational show cave and a major [[Tourism|tourist]] attraction, it hosts approximately 280 000 visitors per year.<ref name = "SDTo"/><br />
The Jeita grotto contributes heavily to the civic life of the region, MAPAS is an important employer and provides full time jobs for around 115 local residents of Jeita (where 30% of which are female).<ref name="geo"/> In addition to employment, the Jeita caves contribute with 5% of the ticket fees to the local municipality, around 10 to 20% of its general revenue to the Lebanese ministry of tourism and 10% of the ticket fees + 10%[[VAT]] to the Lebanese ministry of Finance.<ref name = "SDTo"/><br />

==Other names==
The Jeita Grottoes underwent many name changes, from the Grottoes of Nahr el Kalb, Djaita, Jehita, and finally Jeita. The name change from caves or Grottoes of Nahr el Kalb to Jeita Grottoes happened in 1927 when newspapers widely used the name "Jeita Grottoes". Naher el Kalb is the name of the river that runs through Jeita Grottoes but the entrance to the cave is located in the town of Jeita which means "roaring water" in Aramaic.<ref name = "speleoC"/>
