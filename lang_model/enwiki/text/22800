'''Joseph "Joe" Berrios''' (born February 14, 1952) is a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] politician who is the [[Assessor (property)|Assessor]] of [[Cook County, Illinois]] and a [[Government of Illinois|Illinois state government]] [[lobbyist]]. One of seven children of [[Puerto Rican people|Puerto Rican]] native parents, and raised in the [[Cabrini-Green]] [[public housing]] project, he became the first [[Hispanic and Latino Americans|Hispanic American]] to serve in the [[Illinois General Assembly]] and the first and only Hispanic American to chair the [[Cook County Democratic Party]]. He was a Commissioner on the Cook County Board of Review, a [[property tax]] assessment appeal panel.

Throughout his career, Berrios combined government sector jobs, elected office, unpaid political party leadership positions, and private sector proprietorships in lobbying, consulting and insurance sales. His campaign strategies included [[ballot access]] challenges to potential opponents. He has been the focus of investigations into allegations of ethics violations and [[political corruption]] with respect to campaign fund-raising and [[nepotism]]. In the press and in the courts, Berrios defended his right as an elected official to hire relatives and to accept campaign contributions from those with business before his office.

== Early life, education, and early political career ==

Berrios was born on February 14, 1952, oldest of seven children. Berrios' parents were [[Puerto Rican people|Puerto Rican]] natives. When he was six, his family moved into the [[Cabrini-Green]] [[public housing]] high-rises. At 13 Berrios got a job as a dishwasher in a restaurant, worked there for seven years, and eventually become a waiter. Berrios graduated from [[Lane Technical College Prep High School]] in [[Chicago]], and received a [[bachelor's degree]] in [[accounting]] from the [[University of Illinois Chicago]].<ref name=questionaire>{{cite news |title=Joseph Berrios, Candidate for Cook County Assessor |publisher=[http://abclocal.go.com/wls/ ABC7 News] |url=http://abclocal.go.com/wls/feature?section=news/politics/local_elections&id=7206308 |accessdate=2013-09-16}}</ref><ref name=microscope/>

Berrios' first political role was the unpaid position of a [[precinct captain]] in the 31st Ward political organization of Alderman [[Thomas E. Keane|Thomas Keane]], Chicago Mayor [[Richard J. Daley]]'s chief ally on the City Council.<ref name=rent/> Berrios first met Keane when as student at the [[University of Illinois Chicago]], Berrios was ticketed for [[speeding]] on the [[Kennedy Expressway]] and called on his [[alderman]] and [[committeeman]] Keane.<ref>{{cite news |title=Don`t Overlook This Machine Vs.

In 1978 Nedza won the [[Illinois]] state Senate seat from the 5th Senate district, which encompasses the [[Humboldt Park, Chicago|Humboldt Park]] neighborhood of Chicago, and much of the 31st ward. Nedza, a [[Polish-American]], recognized the growing [[Puerto Rican people|Puerto Rican]] population in his district, and groomed Hispanics within the Democratic Party.<ref>{{cite news |title=Hispanic movement takes cue from past |last1=Galvan |first1=Manuel |last2=Smith |first2=Wes |newspaper=[[Chicago Tribune]] |date=1986-03-09 |url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1986-03-09/news/8601170954_1_wards-hispanics-political |accessdate=2013-09-17}}</ref>

== Illinois State Representative ==

Chicago-area [[Latino]] groups contested the legislative district map of the [[Illinois General Assembly]] in United States federal court. The panel of judges that decided the case ordered a new map that gave [[Hispanics]] a majority in two [[Illinois House of Representatives]] districts in Chicago, the 9th, which is predominantly [[Puerto Rican people|Puerto Rican]], and the 20th, which is predominantly [[Mexican people|Mexican]]. In 1982, Nedza sponsored Berrios, at the time chief clerk to Cook County Board of (Tax) Appeals Commissioner Harry Semrow, in the 9th district.<ref>{{cite news |title=Hispanics try breaking mold in committee races |last=Galvan |first=Manuel |newspaper=[[Chicago Tribune]] |date=1984-02-17}}</ref> Berrios was one of three candidates who filed nominating petitions to run in the Democratic primary, but Berrios ran unopposed when the petitions of the other two candidates were successfully challenged. [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]] fielded no candidate in their primary, so Berrios ran unopposed in the general election, and at the age of 30 became the first [[Hispanic and Latino Americans|Hispanic American]] to serve in the Illinois General Assembly.<ref name=microscope>{{cite news |first=David |last=Bernstein |title=Joseph Berrios, Candidate for Cook County Assessor: Under the Microscope |work=[[Chicago Magazine]] |date=2010-10 |accessdate=2013-09-16 |url=http://www.chicagomag.com/Chicago-Magazine/October-2010/Joseph-Berrios-Candidate-for-Cook-County-Assessor-and-the-Ultimate-Political-Insider/index.php}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=No opponent for Hispanic candidate: Campaign '82 |last=Galvan |first=Manuel |newspaper=[[Chicago Tribune]] |date=1982-05-10}}</ref><ref name>{{cite web |title=A Troubling Assessment of Insider Joseph Berrios |publisher=[http://www.bettergov.org/ Better Government Association] |url=http://www.bettergov.org/a_troubling_assessment_of_insider_joseph_berrios/ |date=2010-08-30 |accessdate=2013-09-17}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Another gain for Hispanic voters |first=Steve |last=Neal |newspaper=[[Chicago Tribune]] |date=1983-06-23}}</ref> Berrios ran for re-election unopposed in the Fall 1986 general election.<ref>{{cite news |title=Cook County races: Illinois House District 9 Republican/No candidate |newspaper=[[Chicago Tribune]] |date=1984-10-28}}</ref> He won re-election twice, serving three two-year terms.<ref>{{cite web |title=About Joseph Berrios |publisher=Cook County Assessor's Office |accessdate=2012-09-11 |url=http://cookcountyassessor.com/aboutjoeberrios.aspx}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cdobs.com/archive/featured/run-forrest-run-claypool-in-race/ |title=Run Forrest Run!

== Democratic party posts ==

=== 31st ward Democratic committeeman ===

In March 1987 then former State Senator Edward Nedza, Berrios' mentor, was indicted in a federal investigation of bribes allegedly paid to city licensing officials.<ref name=master/> In April, 1987 Nedza resigned his position as [[committeeman]] of the 31st ward in Chicago and named Berrios as his replacement. In August, 1987, Nedza was convicted on federal charges of using his political office for illegal financial gain.<ref>{{cite news |title=Nedza's fate mirrors his mentor's |newspaper=[[Chicago Tribune]] |date=1987-08-14 |accessdate=2013-09-17 ||url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1987-08-14/news/8703020056_1_senate-salary-alderman-mayor-harold-washington}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Hispanics Set Goal: Congress Seat In '91 |last=Galvan |first=Manuel |newspaper=[[Chicago Tribune]] |date=1987-04-17 |accessdate=2012-09-21 |url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1987-04-17/news/8701290318_1_26th-ward-alderman-hispanic}}</ref>

Berrios allied with Alderman [[Edward Vrdolyak]], during Chicago Mayor [[Harold Washington]]'s first term, the [[Council Wars]] era. In 1987 Raymond Figueroa, with Washington's backing, defeated Berrios's candidate for alderman, Miguel Santiago, which helped close the Council Wars.

=== Political fundraising from tax appeal lawyers ===

Board of (Tax) Appeals Commissioner Berrios regularly accepted hundreds of thousands of dollars a year in campaign contributions from lawyers who appealed property tax assessments before the Board.<ref>{{cite news |first=Greg |last=Hinz |title=Cook County assessor shouldn't collect campaign cash from property tax law firms |work=[http://www.chicagobusiness.com/ Crain's Chicago Business] |url=http://www.chicagobusiness.com/article/20100123/ISSUE05/100032941/cook-county-assessor-shouldnt-collect-campaign-cash-from-property-tax-law-firms |date=2010-01-25 |accessdate=2013-09-18}}</ref> Berrios controls five personal [[political action committee]]s, not including the fund for the [[Cook County Democratic Party]], which he also controls. Berrios collected more than $3 million in political contributions between 2000 and 2010, 64 percent from property tax appeal lawyers. About one-third of Berrios<U+2019> campaign contributions in that decade came from the 15 property tax appeal law firms that gained the most for their clients between 2006 and 2008, contributing almost $1 million to six political action committees controlled by Berrios and his daughter, Illinois State Representative [[Maria Antonia Berrios]], Democrat of the 39th Illinois House district on Chicago's northwest side. Berrios started 2008 with $1.2 million in just one of his several campaign funds, much of it from attorneys who appeared before him.

Several of the most successful property tax appeal law firms have strong political connections. From 2006 to 2008, the tax appeal law firm that received the largest reductions for their clients was that of [[Michael J. Madigan]], the Illinois House Speaker, a Chicago Democrat and a close ally of Berrios. Other firms among those winning the biggest appeals for their clients included those of Patrick J. Cullerton, the brother of [[John Cullerton]], the president of the Illinois Senate, and Chicago Alderman [[Edward M. Burke]].

Cook County homeowners are eligible for a property-tax break on their primary residence, but a manager in Assessor's office was granted the homeowner's exemption on two homes. In 2012 Cook County Inspector General  Blanchard subpoenaed the Assessor's office seeking documents related to the exemptions. Berrios ignored the subpoena, claiming that the County Inspector General has no authority over him. Blanchard filed suit against Berrios. Berrios is represented in the suit by Cook County State's Attorney Alvarez.<ref>{{cite news |title=Cook County Assessor Joe Berrios also facing a second court fight in dispute over authority |url=http://www.suntimes.com/news/crime/18877524-418/cook-county-assessor-joe-berrios-also-facing-a-second-court-fight-in-dispute-over-authority.html |first1=Dan |last1=Mihalopoulos |first2=Lisa |last2=Donovan |newspaper=[[Chicago Sun-Times]] |date=March 18, 2013 |accessdate=July 1, 2013}}</ref>
