The '''Zugspitze''', at 2,962&nbsp;metres above [[Normalh<U+00F6>hennull|sea level]], is the highest peak of the [[Wetterstein Mountains]] as well as the highest [[mountain]] in [[Germany]]. It lies south of the town of [[Garmisch-Partenkirchen]], and the border between Germany and Austria runs over its western summit. South of the mountain is the ''Zugspitzplatt'', a high [[karst]] [[plateau]] with numerous caves. On the flanks of the Zugspitze are three glaciers, including the two largest in Germany: the [[Schneeferner#Northern Schneeferner|Northern Schneeferner]] with an area of 30.7 [[hectare]]s and the [[H<U+00F6>llentalferner]] with an area of 24.7 hectares. The third is the [[Schneeferner#Southern Schneeferner|Southern Schneeferner]] which covers 8.4 hectares.

The Zugspitze was first conquered on 27 August 1820 by [[Josef Naus]], his survey assistant, Maier, and [[mountain guide]], Johann Georg Tauschl. Today there are three normal routes to the summit: one from the [[H<U+00F6>llental (Wetterstein)|H<U+00F6>llental]] valley to the northeast; another out of the [[Reintal (Wetterstein)|Reintal]] valley to the southeast; and the third from the west over the Austrian Cirque (''<U+00D6>sterreichische Schneekar''). One of the best known ridge routes in the [[Eastern Alps]] runs along the knife-edged Jubilee Ridge (''[[Jubil<U+00E4>umsgrat]]'') to the summit, linking the Zugspitze, the [[Hochblassen]] and the [[Alpspitze]]. For mountaineers there is plenty of accommodation in the vicinity. On the western summit of the Zugspitze itself is the [[M<U+00FC>nchner Haus]] and on the western slopes is the [[Wiener-Neust<U+00E4>dter Hut]].

Three [[cable cars]] run to the top of the Zugspitze. The first, the [[Tyrolean Zugspitze Cable Car]], was built in 1926 and terminated on an ar<U+00EA>te below the summit before the terminus was moved to the actual summit in 1991. A [[rack railway]], the [[Bavarian Zugspitze Railway]], runs inside the northern flank of the mountain and ends on the ''Zugspitzplatt'', from where a second cable car takes passengers to the top. The rack railway and the [[Eibsee Cable Car]], the third cableway, transport an average of 500,000 people to the summit each year. In winter, nine [[ski lift]]s cover the [[ski area]] on the ''Zugspitzplatt''. The weather station, opened in 1900, and the research station in the [[Schneefernerhaus]] are mainly used to conduct climate research.

== Geography ==
[[Image:LageDerZugspitzeInEuropa.png|thumb|180px|left|Map showing the Zugspitze's location]]
The Zugspitze belongs to the [[Wetterstein]] range of the [[Northern Limestone Alps]]. 

The [[border]] between Germany and Austria goes right over the mountain. There used to be a border checkpoint at the summit. But since Germany and Austria are now both part of the [[Schengen zone]], the border crossing is no longer manned.

The exact height of the Zugspitze was a matter of debate for quite a while. Given figures ranged from 2&nbsp;960&nbsp;m to 2&nbsp;970&nbsp;m, but it is now generally accepted that the peak is 2&nbsp;962&nbsp;m above [[sea level]] as a result of a survey carried out by the Bavarian State Survey Office. The lounge at the new caf<U+00E9> is named "2962" for this reason.

=== Location and surrounding area ===

[[File:Zugspitze-Luftbild.JPG|thumb|Annotated aerial photograph of the Zugspitze massif]]
At {{convert|2962|m|ft}} (eastern peak) the Zugspitze is the highest mountain of the Zugspitze massif. This height is referenced to the [[Amsterdam Ordnance Datum|Amsterdam Gauge]] and is given by the [[Bavarian State Office for Survey and Geoinformation]].<ref>{{Internetquelle |url=http://www.zugspitze.de/diebzb/pdf_ulpr/Zugspitze-Hoehe.pdf |titel=Zugspitze XXL:Deutschlands h<U+00F6>chster Berg zeigt seine wahre Gr<U+00F6><U+00DF>e|autor=Eva-Maria Greimel |hrsg=Presseinformation Bayerische Zugspitzbahn Bergbahn AG | format= PDF | zugriff=8 August 2009}}</ref> The same height is recorded against the [[Metres above the Adriatic|Trieste Gauge]] used in Austria, which is 27&nbsp;cm lower. Originally the Zugspitze had three [[peak]]s: the east, middle and west summits (''Ost-, Mittel-'' and ''Westgipfel''). The only one that has remained in its original form is the east summit, which is also the only one that lies entirely on German territory. The middle summit fell victim to one of the cable car summit stations in 1930. In 1938 wurde the west summit was blown up to create a building site for a planned flight control room for the ''[[Wehrmacht]]''. This was never built however. Originally the height of the west summit was given as 2,964&nbsp;metres.<ref>Toni Hiebeler: ''Zugspitze <U+2013> Von der Erstbesteigung bis heute''. Mosaik, Munich, 1985, p.&nbsp;25.</ref>

The Zugspitze rises eleven kilometres southwest of [[Garmisch-Partenkirchen]] and just under six kilometres east of [[Ehrwald]]. The border between Germany and Austria runs over the west summit; thus the Zugspitze massif belongs to the German state of [[Bavaria]] and the Austrian state of [[Tyrol (Bundesland)|Tyrol]]. The municipalities responsible for it are [[Grainau]] and [[Ehrwald]]. To the west the Zugspitze massif drops into the valley of the River [[Loisach]], which flows around the massif towards the northeast in a curve whilst, in the east, the streams of ''Hammersbach'' and [[Partnach]] have their source. To the south the ''Gaistal'' valley and its river, the [[Leutascher Ache]], separate the Wetterstein Mountains from the [[Mieming Chain]]. To the north at the foot of the Zugspitze is the lake of [[Eibsee]]. The next highest mountain in the area is the [[Acherkogel]] ({{H<U+00F6>he|3008}}) in the [[Stubai Alps]], which gives the Zugspitze an [[topographic isolation]] value of 24.6&nbsp;kilometres. The reference point for the [[prominence]] is the [[Parseierspitze]] ({{H<U+00F6>he|3036}}). In order to climb it from the Zugspitze, a descent to the [[Fern Pass]] ({{H<U+00F6>he|1216}}) is required, so that the prominence is 1,746&nbsp;metres.<ref>{{Internetquelle |url=http://www.peakbagger.com/peak.aspx?pid=10012 |titel=Zugspitze |autor= |hrsg=peakbagger.com| sprache= Englisch |zugriff=8 August 2009}}</ref>

==== Zugspitze Massif ====
The [[massif]] of the Zugspitze has several other peaks. To the south the ''Zugspitzplatt'' is surrounded in an arc by the ''Zugspitzeck'' ({{H<U+00F6>he|2820}}) and [[Schneefernerkopf]] ({{H<U+00F6>he|2874}}), the [[Wetterspitzen]] ({{H<U+00F6>he|2747}}), the [[Wetterwandeck]] ({{H<U+00F6>he|2698}}), the [[Plattspitzen]] ({{H<U+00F6>he|2679}}) and the ''Gatterlk<U+00F6>pfen'' ({{H<U+00F6>he|2490}}). The massif ends int the ''Gatterl'' ({{H<U+00F6>he|2024}}), a [[wind gap]] between it and the [[Hochwanner]]. Running eastwards away from the Zugspitze is the famous Jubilee Ridge or ''Jubil<U+00E4>umsgrat'' over the [[H<U+00F6>llentalspitzen]] towards the [[Alpspitze]] and [[Hochblassen]]. The short crest of the ''Riffelwandkamm'' runs northeast over the summits of the [[Riffelwandspitzen]] ({{H<U+00F6>he|2626}}) and the ''Riffelk<U+00F6>pfe'' ({{H<U+00F6>he|2459}}), to the Riffel wind gap (''Riffelscharte'', {{H<U+00F6>he|2161}}). From here the ridge of the ''Waxensteinkamm'' stretches away over the [[Riffelspitzen]] to the [[Waxenstein]].<ref name="Alpenvereinskarte">''[[Alpine Club Map]] 4/2 <U+2013> Wetterstein und Mieminger Gebirge Mitte'' (1:25,000). 5th edition.

==== ''Zugspitzplatt'' ====
[[File:Zugspitze-Wettersteinkamm.jpg|thumb|left|The ''Zugspitzplatt'' above the [[Reintal (Wetterstein)|Reintal]] valley in 2006]]
The ''Platt'' or ''Zugspitzplatt'' is a [[plateau]] below the summit of the Zugspitze to the south and southeast which lies at a height of between 2,000 and 2,650&nbsp;metres. It forms the head of the [[Reintal (Wetterstein)|Reintal]] valley and has been shaped by a combination of [[weathering]], [[karst]]ification and [[glaciation]]. The area contains [[roches moutonn<U+00E9>e]]s, [[doline]]s and [[limestone pavement]]s as a consequence of the [[ice age]]s. In addition [[moraine]]s have been left behind by various [[glacial period]]s. The ''Platt'' was completely covered by a glacier for the last time at the beginning of the 19th century. Today  52&nbsp;% of it consists of [[scree]], 32&nbsp;% of [[bedrock]] and 16&nbsp;% of vegetation-covered soils, especially in the middle and lower areas.<ref>{{Internetquelle |url=http://www.umweltgeol-he.de/WerdenfelserGeotope.Wetterstein.ZugspitzplattUndPlattumrahmung.htm |titel=Zugspitzplatt und Plattumrahmung |autor=Hubert Engelbrecht |hrsg=| sprache= |zugriff=13 August 2009}}</ref>

=== Climate ===
[[File:Klimadiagramm Zugspitze 1961-1990.PNG|thumb|Climatic diagram for the Zugspitze: normal periods 1961-1990]]
From a climatic perspective the Zugspitze lies in the [[temperate zone]] and its prevailing winds are [[Westerlies]]. As the first high [[orographic]] obstacle to these Westerlies in the Alps, the Zugspitze is particular exposed to the weather. It is effectively the north barrier of the Alps (''Nordstau der Alpen''), against which moist air masses pile up and release heavy precipitation. At the same time the Zugspitze acts as protective barrier for parts of the Alps to the south. By contrast, [[F<U+00F6>hn]] weather conditions push in the other direction against the massif, affecting the region for about 60&nbsp;days per year. These  warm, dry air masses stream from south to north and can result in unusually high temperatures in winter. Nevertheless frost dominates the picture on the Zugspitze with an average of 310&nbsp;days per year. The nearest place with comparable values is the island of [[Spitzbergen (island)|Spitzbergen]] in the [[Arctic Ocean]].

For the decades from 1961 to 1990 - designated by the [[World Meteorological Organization]] as the "normal period" - the average annual precipitation on the Zugspitze was 2,003.1&nbsp;[[Precipitation (meteorology)#Measurement|mm]]; the wettest month being April with 199&nbsp;mm, and the driest, October with 108.8&nbsp;mm.<ref name="Mittelwerte">{{Internetquelle |url=http://www.dwd.de/bvbw/appmanager/bvbw/dwdwwwDesktop?_nfpb=true&_pageLabel=_dwdwww_klima_umwelt_klimadaten_deutschland&T82002gsbDocumentPath=Navigation%2FOeffentlichkeit%2FKlima__Umwelt%2FKlimadaten%2Fkldaten__kostenfrei%2Fausgabe__mittelwerte__node.html__nnn%3Dtrue |titel=Klimadaten: Mittelwerte 1961-1990 |autor= |hrsg=Deutscher Wetterdienst | format= ZIP/Exel | zugriff=9.

In: ''[[S<U+00FC>dkurier]]'' dated 28 April 2010.</ref>

The lowest measured temperature on the Zugspitze was -35.6&nbsp;<U+00B0>C in 14 February 1940. The highest temperature occurred on 5 July 1957 when the thermometer reached 17.9&nbsp;<U+00B0>C. A [[squall]] on 12 June 1985 registered 335&nbsp;km/h, the highest measured wind speed on the Zugspitze. In April 1944 meteorologists recorded a snow depth of 8.3&nbsp;metres.<ref>{{Internetquelle |url=http://www.dwd.de/bvbw/generator/DWDWWW/Content/Oeffentlichkeit/KU/KUPK/Wir__ueber__uns/Praesenz/Wetterwarten/Zugspitze,templateId=raw,property=publicationFile.pdf/Zugspitze.pdf |titel=Wetterwarte Zugspitze |autor= |hrsg=Deutscher Wetterdienst | format=PDF | zugriff=4.

=== Geology ===
[[File:Zugspitze 1.jpg|thumb|The north face of the Zugspitze seen from the [[Eibsee]] lake]]
All mountain-building strata consists of [[sedimentary rock]]s of the [[Mesozoic]] era, that were originally laid down on the seabed. The base of the mountain comprises [[muschelkalk]] beds; its upper layers are made of [[Wetterstein limestone]]. With steep rock walls up to 800&nbsp;metres high, it is this Wetterstein limestone from the Upper [[Triassic]] that is mainly responsible for the rock faces, ar<U+00EA>tes, pinnacles and the summit rocks of the mountain. Due to the frequent occurrence of marine coralline algea in the Wetterstein limestone it can be deduced that this rock was at one time formed in a lagoon. The colour of the rock varies between grey-while and light grey to speckled. In several places it contains [[lead]] and [[zinc]] ore. These [[mineral]]s were mined between 1827 and 1918 in the [[H<U+00F6>llental (Wetterstein)|H<U+00F6>llental]] valley. The dark grey, almost horizontal and partly grass-covered layers of muschelkalk run from the foot of the Gro<U+00DF>e Riffelwandspitze to the Ehrwalder K<U+00F6>pfe. From the appearance of the north face of the Zugspitze it can be seen that this massif originally consisted of two mountain ranges that were piled on top of one another.<ref>Stephan Beulke: ''Alpenvereinsf<U+00FC>hrer Wetterstein''. 4th edition. [[Bergverlag Rother]], Munich 1996, p.&nbsp;20ff, ISBN 978-3-7633-1119-4.</ref>

=== Flora ===
[[File:Eibsee & Zugspitze.jpg|thumb|The [[Eibsee]] in front of the Zugspitze: woods on the northern shore]]
The flora on the Zugspitze is not particularly diverse due to the soil conditions, nevertheless the vegetation, especially in the meadows of ''Schachen'', the ''Tieferen Wies'' near Ehrwald, and in the valleys of H<U+00F6>llental, Gaistal and Leutaschtal is especially colourful.
 
The shaded and moist northern slopes of the massif like, for example, the [[Naturwaldreservat Wettersteinwald|Wettersteinwald]], are some of the most species-rich environments on the Zugspitze. The [[Mountain Pine]] grows at elevations of up to  1,800&nbsp;metres. The woods lower down consist mainly of [[Spruce]] and [[Fir]], but [[Honeysuckle]], [[Woodruff]],  poisonous [[Herb Paris]], [[Meadow-rue]] and [[Speedwell]] also occur here. [[Dark Columbine]], [[Alpine Clematis]], Blue and Yellow [[Monkshood]], [[Stemless carline thistle]], [[False aster]], [[Golden cinquefoil]], [[Round-leaved saxifrage]], [[Wall hawkweed]], [[Alpine calamint]] and [[Alpine Forget-me-not]] flower in the less densely wooded places, whilst [[Cinquefoil]], [[Sticky Sage]], [[Butterbur]], [[Alpenrose]], [[Turk's cap lily]] and [[Fly Orchid]] thrive on the rocky soils of the mountain forests. [[Lily of the Valley]] and [[Daphne (plant)|Daphne]] also occur, especially in the H<U+00F6>llental, in Grainau and by the Eibsee.<ref>Helmut Pfanzelt: ''Alpenvereinsf<U+00FC>hrer Wetterstein''. Bergverlag Rudolf Rother, Munich, 1966, p.&nbsp;19, ISBN 3-7633-1113-0.</ref>

To the south the scene changes to [[Larch]] (mainly in the meadow of ''Ehrwalder Alm'' and the valleys of Gaistal and Leutaschtal) and [[pine]] forests and into mixed woods of [[Beech]] and [[Sycamore]]. Here too, Mountain Pine grows at the higher elevations of over 2,000&nbsp;metres.

Relatively rare in the entire Zugspitze area are trees like the [[Lime (tree)|Lime]], [[Birch]], [[Rowan]], [[Juniper]] and [[Yew]]. The most varied species of [[moss]], that often completely cover limestone rocks in the open, occur in great numbers.

[[Bilberry]], [[Cranberry]] and [[Cowberry]] are restricted to dry places and [[Lady's Slipper Orchid]] occurs in sheltered spots. Below the [[Waxenstein]] are fields with [[raspberries]] and occasionally wild [[strawberries]] too. The [[Alpine poppy]] and [[Purple mountain saxifrage]] both thrive up to a very great height. On the scree slops there are [[Thlaspi|Penny-cress]] and [[Mouse-ear chickweed]] as well as [[Mountain avens]], [[Alpine toadflax]], [[Lamiaceae|Mint]] and [[Saxifraga|Musky Saxifrage or Cloth of Gold]]. Following snowmelt [[Sedum|Dark stonecrop]] and [[Snow gentian]] are the first to appear, their seeds beginning to germinate as early as August. And well-known Alpine flowers like the [[Edelweiss]], [[Gentiana|Gentian]]s and, more rarely, [[Cyclamen]] flower on the Zugspitze.

=== Fauna ===
[[File:Alpen Zugspitze Alpendohle 2.jpg|thumb|Alpine choughs on the ''Zugspitzeck'']]
The rocks around the Zugspitze are a habitat for [[Chamois]] and [[Marmot]]s are widespread on the southern side of the massif. At the summit there are frequently [[Alpine Chough]]s, drawn there by people feeding them. Somewhat lower down the mountain there are [[Mountain Hare]] and the [[Hazel Dormouse]]. Alpine birds occurring on the Zugspitze include the [[Golden Eagle]], [[Rock Ptarmigan]], [[Snow Finch]], [[Alpine Accentor]] and [[Brambling]]. The [[Eurasian Crag Martin|Crag Martin]] which has given its name to the ''Schwalbenwand'' ("Swallows' Wall") at Kreuzeck is frequently encountered. The basins of Mittenwald and Seefeld, as well as the Fern Pass are on bird migration routes.

The [[Viviparous lizard]] inhabits rocky terrain, as does the black [[Alpine Salamander]] known locally as the ''Bergmandl'', which can be seen after rain showers as one is climbing. Butterflies like [[Apollo (butterfly)|Apollo]], Alpine Perlmutter, [[Lycaenidae|Gossamer-winged butterfly]], [[Geometer moth]], [[Erebia|Ringlet]] and [[Skipper (butterfly)|Skipper]] may be seen on the west and south sides of the Zugspitze massif, especially in July and August.<ref>Helmut Pfanzelt: ''Alpenvereinsf<U+00FC>hrer Wetterstein''. Bergverlag Rudolf Rother, Munich 1966, p.&nbsp;22, ISBN 3-7633-1113-0.</ref>  The woods around the Zugspitze are home to [[Red Deer]], [[Red Squirrel]], [[Weasel]],  [[Capercaillie]], [[Hazel Grouse]] and [[Black Grouse]]. On the glaciers live glacier fleas (''Desoria saltans'') and [[Tardigrade|water bears]].<ref>Heinrich Schott: ''Die Zugspitze <U+2013> Gipfel der Technik, Triumphe und Trag<U+00F6>dien''.

=== Glaciers ===
Three of the five German glaciers are found on the Zugspitze massif: the [[H<U+00F6>llentalferner]] the [[Schneeferner#Southern Schneeferner|Southern]] and [[Schneeferner#Northern Schneeferner|Northern Schneeferner]].

==== H<U+00F6>llentalferner ====
[[File:H<U+00F6>llentalferner E.JPG|thumb|The H<U+00F6>llentalferner in 2009]]
The H<U+00F6>llentalferner lies northeast of the Zugspitze in a [[cirque]] below the Jubilee Ridge (''[[Jubil<U+00E4>umsgrat]]'') to the south and the [[Riffelwandspitzen]] peaks to the west and north. It has a northeast [[aspect (geography)|aspect]]. Its accumulation zone is formed by a [[depression (geology)|depression]], in which large quantities of [[avalanche]] snow collect. To the south the ''Jubil<U+00E4>umsgrat'' shields the glacier from direct sunshine. These conditions meant that the glacier only lost a relatively small area between 1981 and 2006.<ref>{{Internetquelle |url=http://www.lrz-muenchen.de/~bayerischegletscher/htf.htm |titel=H<U+00F6>llentalferner |autor= Wilfried Hagg |hrsg=Bayerische Gletscher |zugriff=8 August 2009}}</ref> In recent times the H<U+00F6>llentalferner reached its greatest around 1820 with an area of 47 [[hectares]]. Thereafter its area reduced continually until the period betwen 1950 and 1981 when it grew again, by 3.1 hectares to 30.2 hectares. Since then the glacier has lost (as at 2006) an area of 5.5 hectares and now has an area of 24.7 hectares. In 2006 the glacier head was at 2,569 m and its lowest point at 2,203&nbsp;metres.<ref>{{Internetquelle |url=http://www.lrz-muenchen.de/~bayerischegletscher/htf/htf_topo.htm |titel=Fl<U+00E4>che und H<U+00F6>hen des H<U+00F6>llentalferners |autor= Wilfried Hagg |hrsg=Bayerische Gletscher |zugriff=8 August 2009}}</ref>

==== Schneeferner ====
[[File:N<U+00F6>rdlicher Schneeferner.JPG|thumb|The Northern Schneeferner and winter sport infrastructure in 2009]]

===== Northern Schneeferner =====
Southwest of the Zugspitze, between the ''Zugspitzeck'' and [[Schneefernerkopf]], is the Northern Schneeferner which has an eastern aspect. With an area of 30.7 hectares (2006) it is the largest German glacier. Around 1820 the entire ''Zugspitzplatt'' was glaciated, but of this Platt Glacier (''Plattgletscher'') only the Northern and Southern Schneeferner remain. The reason for the relatively constant area of the Northern Schneeferner in recent years, despite the lack of shade, is the favourable [[terrain]] that results in the glacier tending to grow or shrink in depth rather than area. In the recent past the glacier has also been artificially fed by the ski region operators, using piste tractors to heap large quantities of snow onto the glacier in order to extend the skiing season. At the beginning of the 1990s, ski slope operators began to cover the Northern Schneeferner in summer with artificial sheets in order to protect it from sunshine.<ref>{{Internetquelle |url=http://www.lrz-muenchen.de/~bayerischegletscher/nsf.htm |titel=N<U+00F6>rdlicher Schneeferner |autor= Wilfried Hagg |hrsg=Bayerische Gletscher |zugriff=8.

By 2006 it had shrunk to 30.7 hectares.

===== Southern Schneeferner =====
The Southern Schneeferner is surrounded by the peaks of the [[Wetterspitzen]] and the [[Wetterwandeck]]. It is also a remnant of the once great ''Platt Glacier''. Today, the Southern Schneeferner extends up as far as the [[ar<U+00EA>te]] and therefore has no protection from direct sunshine. It has also been divided into two basins by a ridge of rock that has appeared as the snow has receded. It is a matter of debate whether the Southern Schneeferner should still be classified as a glacier.<ref>{{Internetquelle |url=http://www.lrz-muenchen.de/~bayerischegletscher/ssf.htm |titel=S<U+00FC>dlicher Schneeferner |autor= Wilfried Hagg |hrsg=Bayerische Gletscher |zugriff=8. August 2009}}</ref> The Southern Schneeferner also reached its last high point in 1979, when it covered an area of 31.7 hectares. This had shrunk by 2006 to just 8.4 hectares however. The highest point of the glacier lies at an elevation of 2,665 metres and the lowest at 2,520&nbsp;metres.<ref>{{Internetquelle |url=http://www.lrz-muenchen.de/~bayerischegletscher/ssf/ssf_topo.htm |titel=Fl<U+00E4>che und H<U+00F6>hen des S<U+00FC>dlichen Schneeferners |autor= Wilfried Hagg |hrsg=Bayerische Gletscher |zugriff=8 August 2009}}</ref>

=== Caves ===
Below the ''Zugspitzplatt'' [[chemical weathering]] processes have created a large number of [[cave]]s and [[ab<U+00EE>me]]s in the Wetterstein limestone. In the 1930s the number of caves was estimated at 300. By 1955 62 caves were known to exist and by 1960 another 47 had been discovered. The first cave explorations here took place in 1931. Other, largest exploratory expeditions took place in 1935 and 1936 as well as between 1955 and 1968. During one expedition, in 1958, the Finch Shaft (''Finkenschacht'') was discovered. It is 131&nbsp;metres deep, 260&nbsp;metres long and has a watercourse. There is a theory that this watercourse could be a link to the [[source (river)|source]] of the River [[Partnach]].<ref group="Note">According to this theory there is a lake underneath the ''Zugspitzplatt'' that feeds the Partnach. Calculations show that the ''Platt'' produces 350 litres of water per second; the source of the Partnach however delivers at least 500 (and possibly up to several thousand litres). The difference is is put down to a cave lake that also supplies the Partnach.</ref><ref>Heinrich Schott: ''Die Zugspitze <U+2013> Gipfel der Technik, Triumphe und Trag<U+00F6>dien''.

== Name ==
From the early 14th century, geographic names from the Wetterstein Mountains began to be recorded in treaties and on maps, and this trend intensified in the 15th century. In 1536 a border treaty dating to 1500 was refined in that its course was specified as running over a ''Schartten'' ("wind gap" or "col")<ref name="Hauslauer">Johannes Haslauer: ''"Nur f<U+00FC>r sehr ge<U+00FC>bte Steiger". Voralpinistische Ann<U+00E4>herungen an das Wettersteingebirge und die Zugspitze''. In: Walter Theil (Hrsg.): ''Alpenvereinsjahrbuch <U+2013> Berg 2010''. Vol. 134. Alpenvereinsverlag, Munich, 2009, p.&nbsp;163, ISBN 978-3-937530-50-5</ref>. In the 17th century the reference to this landmark in the treaty was further clarified as ''"now known as the Zugsp<U+00FC>z"'' (''jetzt Zugsp<U+00FC>z genant'').<ref name="Hauslauer"/> The landmark referred to was a wind gap on the summit of the Zugspitze and is used time and again in other sources. During the [[Middle Ages]] ''Scharte'' was a common name for the Zugspitze.<ref name="Hauslauer"/>

The Zugspitze was first mentioned by name in 1590. In a description of the border between the [[County of Werdenfels]] and Austria, it states that the same border runs ''"from the Zugspitz and over the Derle"'' (''von dem Zugspitz und <U+00FC>ber den Derle"'')<ref name="a">Fritz Schmitt: ''Alpinmonographie: Wetterstein <U+2013> T<U+00E4>ler, Grate, W<U+00E4>nde''. Bergverlag Rother, Ottobrunn 1979, p.&nbsp;58.</ref> and continues to a bridge over the River [[Loisach]]. Another border treaty in 1656 states: ''"The highest Wetterstein or Zugspitz"'' (''"Der h<U+00F6>chste Wetterstain oder Zugspitz"'').<ref name="a"/> There is also a map dating to the second half of the 18th century that shows ''"the [[Reintal (Wetterstein)|Reintal]] in the County of Werdenfels"''. It covers the Reintal valley from the Reintaler Hof to the ''Zugspitzplatt'' and shows prominent points in the surrounding area, details of tracks and roads and the use pasture use. This includes a track over the then much larger Schneeferner glacier to the summit region of the  Zugspitze. However the map does not show any obvious route to the summit itself.<ref>Kurt Brunner, Thomas Horst: ''[http://retro.seals.ch/openurl?rft.issn=1015-8480&rft.issue=35&rft.date=2007&lPage=3 Eine Karte des Zugspitzgebiets (18. Jh.) und die Wirrnisse um die Erstbesteigung].'' In: ''Cartographica Helvetica <U+2013> Heft 35''. 2007, p.&nbsp;3<U+2013>7.</ref>

The name of the Zugspitze is probably derived from its ''Zugbahnen'' or avalanche paths. In winter avalanches sweep down from the upper slopes of the massif into the valley and leave behind characteristic avalanche remnants in the shape of rocks and scree.
Near the [[Eibsee]] lake there are several [[land lot|plots of land]] with the same root: ''Zug'', ''Zuggasse'', ''Zugstick'', ''Zugm<U+00F6>sel'' or ''Zugwankel''.<ref name="a"/> Until the 19th century the name ''der Zugspitz'' was commonplace. It was described as ''die Zugspitze'' for the first time on a map printed in 1836.<ref>Toni Hiebeler: ''Zugspitze <U+2013> Von der Erstbesteigung bis heute''. Mosaik, Munich, 1985, p.&nbsp;252.</ref>

== Summit cross ==
[[File:Alpen Zugspitze Gipfelkreuz Bayern.jpg|thumb|Summit cross on the Zugspitze]]
Since 1851 there has been a [[summit cross]] on the top of Zugspitze. The driving force behind the erection of a cross on the summit was the priest, Christoph Ott. He was a keen meteorologist and whilst observing conditions from the [[Hoher Pei<U+00DF>enberg]] mountain he saw the Zugspitze in the distance and was exercised by the fact that ''"the greatest prince of the Bavarian mountains raised its head into the blue air towards heaven, bare and unadorned, waiting for the moment when patriotic fervour and courageous determination would see that his head too was crowned with dignity."''<ref>Bernd Ritschel, Tom Dauer: ''Faszinierende Zugspitze''. Bruckmann, Munich, 2007, p.&nbsp;35.</ref> As a result he organised an expedition from 11 to 13 August 1851 with the goal of erecting a summit cross on the Zugspitze. Twenty eight bearers were led through the gorge of the [[Partnachklamm]] and the [[Reintal (Wetterstein)|Reintal]] valley under the direction of forester, Karl Kiendl, up to the Zugspitze. The undertaking, which cost 610&nbsp;[[Gulden]] and 37&nbsp;[[Kreuzer (coin)|Kreuzer]], was a success. As a result, a 28-piece, 14&nbsp;[[foot (unit)|foot]] high, gilded iron cross now stood on the West Summit. Ott himself did not climb the Zugspitze until 1854. After 37 years the cross had to be taken down after suffering numerous lightning strikes; its support brackets were also badly damaged. In the winter of 1881<U+2013>1882 it was therefore brought down into the valley and repaired. On 25 August 1882 seven mountain guides and  15 bearers took the cross back to the top. Because an accommodation shed had been built on the West Summit, the team placed the cross on the East Summit. There is remained for about 111&nbsp;years, until it was removed again on 18 August 1993. This time the damage was not only caused by the weather, but also by some ill-disciplined American soldiers who had shot at the cross in 1945, at the end of the [[Second World War]]. Because the summit cross could no longer be repaired, an replica was made that was true to the original cross. After two months the rack railway carried the new cross on 12 October to the ''Zugspitzplatt'', from where it was flown to the summit by [[helicopter]]. The new cross has a height of 4.88&nbsp;metres.<ref>Bernd Ritschel, Tom Dauer: ''Faszinierende Zugspitze''. Bruckmann, Munich, 2007, p.&nbsp;35ff.</ref> It was renovated and regilded in 2009 for 15,000&nbsp;euros and, since 22 April 2009, has stood once again on the East Summit.<ref>{{Internetquelle |url=http://www.br-online.de/bayern/wege-und-ziele/zugspitze-gipfelkreuz-einweihung-ID1239715496338.xml |titel=Zugspitze <U+2013> Das Gipfelkreuz steht wieder |autor= |hrsg=BR-online |zugriff=9 August 2009}}</ref>

== History ==
[[File:Zugspitze (Luftbild).jpg|thumb|Aerial photograph of the summit]]
The first recorded ascent to the summit was accomplished by a team of land surveyors on the 27th of August, 1820. The team was led by Lieutenant Josef Naus, who was accompanied by two men named Maier and G. Deutschl. However, local people had conquered the peak over 50 years earlier, according to a [[1770]] map discovered by the Alpenverein.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/international/story/0,,1877123,00.html |title=Locals had climbed peak before it was 'conquered' |publisher=[[The Guardian]] |date=21 September 2006 | location=London | first=Luke | last=Harding | accessdate=20 April 2010}}</ref>

On 7 January 1882 the first successful winter assault on the Zugspitze was accomplished by F. Kilger, H. and J. Zametzer and H. Schwaiger.

Pilot, Frank Hailer, caused a stir on 19 March 1922, when he landed a plane with [[skid]]s on the Schneeferner glacier. On 29 April 1927 [[Ernst Udet]] succeeded in taking off from the Schneeferner with a [[glider (sailplane)|glider]]; he landed at [[Lermoos]] after a 25 minute flight. The glider had been disassembled into individual parts and transported up the Zugspitze by cable car. In the winter of 1931/32, a post office was set up on the Zugspitze by the German Imperial Post Office or ''[[Reichspost]]''. It still exists today in the ''Sonnalpin'' restaurant and has the postal address: ''82475 Zugspitze''. In 1931, four years after the first glider flight, the first [[balloon (aircraft)|balloon]] took off from the Zugspitze

In April 1933, the mountain was occupied by of 24 [[Sturmabteilung|storm troopers]], who hoisted a [[swastika]] flag on top the tower on the weather station. A month later, SA and [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] deployed on the Schneeferner in the shape of a swastika. On 20 April 1945 the [[United States Air Force|US Air Force]] dropped bombs on the Zugspitze that destroyed the valley station of the Tyrolean Zugspitze Railway and the hotel on the ridge. After the war the Allies seized the railway and Schneefernerhaus. 

Shortly after World War II the [[US military]] took over the Schneefernerhaus (as the hotel at the top was then called) for the exclusive use of US military and civilian employees. Room rates, including meals, were US $1 per day. Ski lessons were available, taught by Austrians and Germans, at a cost of US $0.25 per hour.

In 1948, the German Federal Post Office (''[[Deutsche Bundespost]]'') began operating a [[Microwave transmission|microwave radio station]] at the summit. In September of that year, three [[artiste]]s walked a steel tightrope stretched between the East and West Summits. Two members of the Traber family traversed the same route in 1953 on a tightrope on a motorcycle. Since 1953, an annual Gatterl Mass (''Gatterlmesse'') has been held on the ''Gatterl'' mountain to commemorate the four members of the [[Bavarian Border Police]] who died in an avalanced in 1952 as well as all those who have died on the Zugspitze.<ref>{{Internetquelle |url=http://www.zugspitzbahn.at/zugspitzbahn/de/gatterlmesse.html |titel=Gatterlmesse 2009 |autor= |hrsg=Tiroler Zugspitzbahn| sprache= |zugriff=23 October 2009}}</ref>

In 1962 a fire destroyed the ridge hotel by the mountain station of the Tyrolean Zugspitze Railway. The [[1976 Friuli earthquake]] was also felt particularly strongly on the Zugspitze: the duty meteorologist feared that the observation tower might collapse<ref>Heinrich Schott: ''Die Zugspitze <U+2013> Gipfel der Technik, Triumphe und Trag<U+00F6>dien''. S<U+00FC>ddeutscher Verlag, Munich, 1987, p.&nbsp;200.</ref> In 1981 a [[chapel]] was founded on the Zugspitze, which was consecrated by the Archbishop of Munich and Freising, [[Benedict XVI|Joseph Ratzinger]]], in October on the feast of [[Visitation (Christianity)|Visitation]]. On 25 March, an ATM machine was installed at the summit station; it has since been removed. In 1995, a 450 square metre exhibition area was opened at the summit, in which artists present their work for six months, before the exhibition is changed. In 1995, the border between Germany and Austria at the summit was opened.<ref name="c">Bernd Ritschel, Tom Dauer: ''Faszinierende Zugspitze''. Bruckmann, Munich, 2007, p.&nbsp;116ff.</ref>

Since 2000, the Zugspitze extreme mountain run has been held annually. In July 2008 there were repercussions in the [[mass media|media]] when, as the result of a sudden drop in temperature, two participants died of exhaustion and hypothermia<ref>{{Internetquelle |url=http://www.sueddeutsche.de/bayern/450/448184/text/ |titel=Zwei Tote bei Extrem-Berglauf <U+2013> Staatsanwaltschaft untersucht Zugspitz-Drama |autor= |hrsg=sueddeutsche.de| sprache= German|zugriff=14 August 2009}}</ref> At the end of August 2009 the Swiss, Freddy Nock, walked along a cable of the [[Zugspitze Glacier Railway]] from the ''Zugspitzplatt'' to the summit. He covered the 995 metre long, up to 56% steep route (which had a height difference of 348 metres) unsecured in 50 minutes.<ref>{{Internetquelle |url=http://www.br-online.de/bayerisches-fernsehen/rundschau/zugspitze-nock-hochseilartist-ID1251483620888.xml |titel=Nerven wie Drahtseile |autor= |hrsg=br-online.de.| sprache=German |zugriff=23 Oktober 2009}}</ref>

== Alpinism ==
=== First ascent ===
[[File:01 Joseph Naus 1824.jpg|thumb|upright|Josef Naus in 1824 (Drawing by H. v. Aggenstein)]]
There are several theories about the first ascent of the Zugspitze. The chronological table on an 18th century map describes the route ''"along the path to the Zugspitze"'' (''"ybers blath uf Zugspitze"'')<ref>Bernd Ritschel, Tom Dauer: ''Faszinierende Zugspitze''. Bruckmann, Munich, 2007, p.&nbsp;9.</ref> and gives a realistic duration of 8.5&nbsp;hours, so that it is reasonable to deduce that the summit had been climbed before 1820. The historian, Thomas Linder, believes that goatherds or hunters had at the very least penetrated to the area of the summit. It is also conceivable that [[smuggler]]s used routes over the Zugspitze summit.<ref>Bernd Ritschel, Tom Dauer: ''Faszinierende Zugspitze''. Bruckmann, Munich, 2007, p.&nbsp;10.</ref> As early as 1804 cartographic surveys had taken place in the area for the County of Werdenfels. There is speculation that, in the course of this work, the royal engineer and geographer, Alois von Coulon, and reached the summit. Since Coulon worked for the Topographical Bureau, it is unlikely that his ascent would not have been noted.<ref>Bernd Ritschel, Tom Dauer: ''Faszinierende Zugspitze''. Bruckmann, Munich, 2007, p.&nbsp;16.</ref>

The first recorded ascent of the Zugspitze was achieved on 27 August 1820 by [[Lieutenant]] [[Josef Naus]] and [[mountain guide]], Johann Georg Tauschl<ref group="Note">Tauschl is often called ''Deuschl''. Ritschel and Dauer have shown this to be an unexplained error. Hiebeler calls the diary entry ''Tauschl'' by Josef Naus a mistake.</ref> together with Naus' survey assistant and [[batman (military)]], Maier.<ref>[http://books.google.de/books?id=V1NbPeUU7dsC&pg=PA124&dq=josef+naus+zugspitze&hl=de&ei=yJqgTc2mD9rQ4wbG2oyrAw&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=6&ved=0CFoQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&q=josef%20naus%20zugspitze&f=false ''Deutschlands h<U+00F6>chste Gipfel: 35 Touren von der K<U+00FC>ste bis zu den Alpen''] by Herbert Farr.

Accessed on 9 Apr 2011.</ref> had asked about the route through the Reintal valley to the Northern  Schneeferner. The lieutenant was taking part in a survey exercise by the Royal Bavarian Topographic Bureau (''K<U+00F6>niglich Bairischen Topographischen Bureau'') for the Atlas of Bavaria (''Atlas von Bayern'') in the [[Werdenfelser Land]]. On 26 August, the three of them climbed in a group together with [[Captain (Army)|Captain]] Jetze and Lieutenant Antlischek up to the shepherd's hut of ''Angerh<U+00FC>tte''. On 27 August around 4 in the morning, Naus, Tauschl and Maier set off for the ''Zugspitzplatt'' and Zugspitze summit. From the Schneeferner glacier they attempted to reach the West Summit along the west ridge. Their first attempt failed, but a second was successful and they finally reached the West Summit around 11:45 am, where they left behind a ''[[bergstock]]'' and cloth to mark their success. A thunderstorm and snowfall forced them to climb down again quickly. On 28 August they returned to the shepherd's hut at about 3 in the morning. The mountain guide, Tauschl, was given payment of two gulden and 42 kreuzer.<ref>Bernd Ritschel, Tom Dauer: ''Faszinierende Zugspitze''. Bruckmann, Munich, 2007, p.&nbsp;9ff.</ref>

=== Subsequent ascents ===
[[File:Max Wolfinger Zug-Spitz am Eib-See 1864.jpg|thumb|The Zugspitze in 1864 (oil by Max Wolfinger)]]
In 1823, Simon Resch and the sheep ''Toni'' became the first to reach the East Summit. Simon Resch was also led the second ascent of the East Summit on 18 September 1834 with his son, Johann, and the mountain guide, Johann Barth. Becasue Resch's first ascent had been doubted, this time a fire was lighted on the summit. On the 27th the summit was climbed fora third time by royal forester's assistants, Franz Oberst and Schwepfinger, along with Johann Barth. Oberst erected a flagpole on the summit with a Bavarian flag that was visible from the valley. The first ascent from Austria took place in August 1837. The surveyors, Joseph Feuerstein and Joseph Sonnweber, climbed to the West Summit from Ehrwald and left behind a signal pole with their initials on it. The West Summit was conquered for the third time on 10 September 1843 by the shepherd Peter Pfeifer. He was asked about the route by a group of eight climbers who later reached the summit at the behest of Bavaria's [[Marie of Prussia|Crown Princess Marie]]. She had the route checked in preparation for her own ascent of the Zugspitze. On 22 September 1853 Karoline Pitzner became the first woman on the Zugspitze. The first crossing from the West to the East Summit was achieved in 1857 by Dr.&nbsp;H<U+00E4>rtringer from Munich and the mountain guide, Joseph Ostler. The Irish brother, Trench, and the Englishman, Cluster, succeeded in climbing the West Summit on 8 July 1871 through the Austrian Cirque (''<U+00D6>sterreichische Schneekar'') under the guidance of brothers, Joseph and Joseph Sonnweber. The route through the H<U+00F6>llental valley to the Zugspitze was first used on 26 September 1876 by Franz Tillmetz and Franz Johannes with guides, Johann and Joseph Dengg. The first winter ascent of the West Summit took place on 7 Januar 1882; the climbers being Ferdinand Kilger, Heinrich Schwaiger, Josef and Heinrich Zametzer and Alois Zott. The Jubilee Ar<U+00EA>te (''Jubil<U+00E4>umsgrat'') was first crossed in its entirety on 2 September 1897 by Ferdinand Henning. The number of climbers on the Zugspitze rose sharply year on year. If the summit had been climbed 22 times in 1854, by 1899 it had received 1,600 ascents.  Before the construction of a cable car in 1926 there had already been over 10,000 ascents.<ref>Bernd Ritschel, Tom Dauer: ''Faszinierende Zugspitze''. Bruckmann, Munich, 2007, p.&nbsp;16ff.</ref>

=== Normal routes ===
==== ''Zugspitzplatt'' via the Reintal or Gatterl ====
[[File:Reintal vom Gatterl HQ.jpg|thumb|View from the ''Gatterl'' into the Reintal]]
The easiest of the normal routes runs through the [[Reintal (Wetterstein)|Reintal]] valley and is that followed during the first ascent. At the same time it is also the longest climb. Its start point is the ski stadium ({{H<U+00F6>he|730}}) at [[Garmisch-Partenkirchen]]. The route runs through the gorge of the [[Partnachklamm]] and along the Partnach river to the Bock Hut ({{H<U+00F6>he|1052}}), where the Reintal begins. Above the Partnach, which has meanwhile sunk underground, the route runs up to the [[Reintalanger Hut]] ({{H<U+00F6>he|1370}}). From there the climb is relatively gentle to start with, but then becomes steeper. From the hut the track runs through the ''Brunntal'' up to the [[Knorr Hut]] ({{H<U+00F6>he|2057}}), which stands on the eastern rim of the ''Zugspitzplatt''. Here it meets the alternative route from Ehrwald via the Gaistal and the ''Gatterl'' at the Reintal Way. The route now runs over the ''Zugspitzplatt'' towards the Northern Schneeferner. The protected section of the climb to the Zugspitze summit begins above the ''Sonn-Alpin'' restaurant at ''Point 2815''. The route climbs through a height of 2,232&nbsp; metres and the true duration is between eight and ten hours.<ref name="Alpenvereinskarte"/><ref>Bernd Ritschel, Tom Dauer: ''Faszinierende Zugspitze''. Bruckmann, Munich 2007, p.&nbsp;113f.</ref>

==== H<U+00F6>llental ====
[[File:Hoellentalangerhuette Richtung Zugspitze.jpg|thumb|View from the H<U+00F6>llentalanger Hut towards the Zugspitze]]
The ascent starts in [[Hammersbach (Grainau)|Hammersbach]] ({{H<U+00F6>he|758}}) through the [[H<U+00F6>llental (Wetterstein)|H<U+00F6>llental]] along the ''Hammersbach'' stream. The path runs through the H<U+00F6>llental Gorge (''H<U+00F6>llentalklamm'') and was built from 1902 to 1905. Twelve tunnels were driven in the rock of the 1,026&nbsp;metre long gorge with a total length of 288&nbsp;metres. Another 569&nbsp;metres of path was dynamited into the rock in the shape of a half profile, whilst 120&nbsp;metres was led over [[footbridge]]s and  49&nbsp;metres over scree. The construction costs came to a total of 57,000 [[gold mark]]s. Each year around 60,000 people pass through the gorge.<ref>Peter Schwarz: ''Der Bau des H<U+00F6>llentalklammweges 1902 bis 1905''. In: Walter Theil (Hrsg.): ''Alpenvereinsjahrbuch <U+2013> Berg 2009''. Vol. 133. Alpenvereinsverlag, Munich, 2008, p.&nbsp;252ff, ISBN 978-3-937530-29-1.</ref> The gorge can also be circumnavigated over the ''Stangensteig'' path. After the gorge the route heads for the  [[H<U+00F6>llentalanger Hut]] ({{H<U+00F6>he|1381}}), after which it crosses the ''H<U+00F6>llentalanger'' stream. Above that the ''Brett'' is crossed on steel pins fixed to a rock face. Crossing the ''Gr<U+00FC>nen Buckel'' the trail runs up to the H<U+00F6>llentalferner glacier. The glacier is mostly snow-free in summer so that crampons are required to cross it. Even more difficult is the [[randkluft]] because the ice retreats further and further from the rock as it melts. After the glacier there is a ''[[klettersteig]]'' to the summit of the Zugspitze. This route climbs through a height of 2,204&nbsp;metres, for which between seven and eight hours are needed. There is also the option of getting to the H<U+00F6>llental route on the ''Riffelsteig'' path from Eibsee. This path crosses the ''Riffelscharte'' wind gap and meets the route before the ''Brett''.<ref name="Alpenvereinskarte"/><ref>Bernd Ritschel, Tom Dauer: ''Faszinierende Zugspitze''. Bruckmann, Munich, 2007, p.&nbsp;113.</ref>

==== Austrian Cirque ====
A third ascent runs across the Austrian Cirque or ''<U+00D6>sterreichische Schneekar''. Starting point for this are the lake of Eibsee ({{H<U+00F6>he|950}}) or the village of Ehrwald ({{H<U+00F6>he|1000}}). The two trails merge above the cirque of ''Gamskar''. Thereafter the routhe continues to the [[Wiener-Neust<U+00E4>dter Hut]] ({{H<U+00F6>he|2209}}) and through the ''<U+00D6>sterreichische Schneekar'', at the end of which a ''klettersteig'' begins. During this section the route climbs through the ''Stopselzieher'', a natural drainage cave. The route then joins the secured sections of the Reintal route. This ascent takes at least eight hours and climbs  2,012&nbsp;metres in height.<ref name="Alpenvereinskarte"/><ref>Bernd Ritschel, Tom Dauer: ''Faszinierende Zugspitze''.

=== Jubilee Ridge (''Jubil<U+00E4>umsgrat'') ===
[[File:Jubil<U+00E4>umsgrat West HQ.jpg|thumb|Western section of the ar<U+00EA>te: view from the Middle H<U+00F6>llentalspitze to the Zugspitze]]
One of the best-known ridge routes in the Eastern Alps is the [[Jubilee Ridge]], which runs eastwards from the Zugspitze to the  [[Hochblassen]] ({{H<U+00F6>he|2707}}) and crosses the Inner ({{H<U+00F6>he|2737}}), Middle ({{H<U+00F6>he|2740}}) and Outer [[H<U+00F6>llentalspitzen|H<U+00F6>llentalspitze]] ({{H<U+00F6>he|2716}}) as well as the [[Vollkarspitze]] ({{H<U+00F6>he|2630}}). Along the way the route branches off towards ''Grie<U+00DF>karscharte'' ({{H<U+00F6>he|2463}}) and to the Alpspitze ({{H<U+00F6>he|2628}}). Between 1909 and 1915 the ridge was partially secured with wire cables by the German Alpine Club section at Munich. Originally the route was called the Jubilee Way (''Jubil<U+00E4>umsweg''), but after a tragic rescue attempt in 1979 the rather erroneous and misleading term, which suggested it was just a normal trail, was replaced by the name ''Jubil<U+00E4>umsgrat'', a ''Grat'' being a sharp ridge.<ref>Heinrich Schott: ''Die Zugspitze <U+2013> Gipfel der Technik, Triumphe und Trag<U+00F6>dien''. S<U+00FC>ddeutscher Verlag, Munich, 1987, p.&nbsp;188.</ref> During the crossing, which is not a pure ''klettersteig'', several unprotected sections have to be negotiated that roughly correspond to [[climbing grade]] III. The most difficult climbing section is a smooth gully (III-). In the area of the Vollkarspitze peak is a climbing section of difficulty ([[Klettersteig|D]]). The difficulty of the roughly eight kilometre long climbing route is around  I and II as well as B. Normally it can be crossed in one day during the summer. Between the Middle and Outer H<U+00F6>llentalspitze is the ''H<U+00F6>llengrat Hut'' ({{H<U+00F6>he|2684}}), a [[bothy]] where climbers can take refuge for the night. It is mainly used during winter crossing, when the tour is split into two stages. The approach route to the tour is also possible from the Knorr Hut via the ''Brunntalgrat'' ridge and joins the route in the area of the Inner H<U+00F6>llentalspitze.<ref>{{Internetquelle |url=http://www.bergsteigen.at/de/touren.aspx?ID=1496 |titel=Tourenbuch: Jubil<U+00E4>umsgrat Zugspitze |autor= |hrsg=bergsteigen.at |zugriff=9 August 2009}}</ref>

There are numerous [[mountain hut]]s in the area of the Zugspitze. One base is the [[H<U+00F6>llentalanger Hut]] ({{H<U+00F6>he|1381}}) in the H<U+00F6>llental valley with 88 [[Matratzenlager|matress spaces]]. Accommodation in the Reintal is provided by the [[Reintalanger Hut]] ({{H<U+00F6>he|1370}}) with 90 bedspaces and on the edge of the ''Zugspitzplatt'' by the [[Knorr Hut]] ({{H<U+00F6>he|2051}}) with 108 bedspaces. The Knorr Hut was the first hut in the entire Wetterstein Mountains when it was built in 1855. All the huts are open from May to October depending on the weather. On the top of the Zugspitze are three more huts: the [[Wiener-Neust<U+00E4>dter Hut]], the [[M<U+00FC>nchner Haus]] and the [[Schneefernerhaus]].

==== Wiener-Neust<U+00E4>dter Hut ====
The first hut on the Zugspitze was the [[Wiener-Neust<U+00E4>dter Hut]] (''Wiener-Neust<U+00E4>dter-H<U+00FC>tte'', {{H<U+00F6>he|2209}}) built in 1884. It acts as a base for the ''klettersteig'' through the ''<U+00D6>sterreichische Schneekar'' that was opened as far back as 1879. The hut is located on the western rim of the cirque and stand below the Tyrolean Zugspitze Cable Car. It is operated by the [[Austrian Tourist Club]] and offers overnighting for up to 34 mountaineers in the period from July to October. The [[winter room]] is designed to take 14 people and has no cooking or heating facilities.

==== M<U+00FC>nchner Haus ====
There has been an accommodation hut just underneath the West Summit since 1883. At that time the [[Alpine Club Section]] at Munich built a wooden hut with places for twelve people. Although the further development of the summit for toursim was criticised, more and more members supported the construction of a larger hut. This eventually resulted in the building of the [[M<U+00FC>nchner Haus]] ({{H<U+00F6>he|2959}}). First, in 1896, a 200&nbsp;square metre site was dynamited out of the rock. The new mountain hut was completed on 19 September 1897 at a cost of 36,615 gold marks. It was equipped with a 21&nbsp;kilometre long telephone cable and a  5.5&nbsp;kilometre long [[lightning conductor]]. In the years 1911 to 1914 the hut was extended and given its present appearance. It offer 30 beds for overnight stays and is open from May to October. An average of 2,000 people stay there each year, in addition to day visitors.<ref>Bernd Ritschel, Tom Dauer: ''Faszinierende Zugspitze''. Bruckmann, Munich, 2007, p.&nbsp;89ff.</ref>

==== Schneefernerhaus ====
The [[Schneefernerhaus]] ({{H<U+00F6>he|2656}}) was built in 1930 as the station of the [[Bavarian Zugspitz Railway]]. In June 1931 the attached [[hotel]] was opened. After the war, US Forces commandeered the house as a "recreation facility". It was not released until 1952 and was then renovated, opening in December that same year. On 15 Mai 1965 it was hit by a serious avalanche. The avalanche had been triggered above the house and swept over the sun terrace. Ten people lost their lives and 21 were seriously injured. At the end of the 1980s the station was moved and, in January 1992 the hotel and restaurant closed. 1993 and 1997 it was extensively converted into a research station, that opened in 1996. During the building work there was a fire in 1994 that completely destroyed the fifth floor and the roof space.<ref>Bernd Ritschel, Tom Dauer: ''Faszinierende Zugspitze''.

== Tourism ==
=== Winter sports ===

For those wishing to reach the summit under their own power, various hiking and ski trails can also be followed to the top. Hiking to the top from the base takes between one and two days, or a few hours for the very fit. Food and lodging is available on some trails. In winter the Zugspitze is a popular [[skiing]] and [[snowboarding]] destination, with several slopes on both sides. The Zugspitzplatt is Germany's highest ski resort, and thus normally has sufficient snow throughout the winter.

=== Climbing ===
At the Zugspitze's summit is the ''M<U+00FC>nchner Haus'', a [[mountain hut]] (''Alpenh<U+00FC>tte''), a facility built by the [[German Alpine Club]] (''Deutscher Alpenverein''). For more than a hundred years, the summit has also had a weather station, which nowadays also gathers data for the [[Global Atmosphere Watch]].

Climbing up the Zugspitze can involve several routes. The large difference in elevation between Garmisch-Partenkirchen and the summit is 2&nbsp;200&nbsp;m, making the climb a challenge even for trained [[mountaineer]]s.

On the [[Germany|German]] side, from [[Garmisch-Partenkirchen]], climbers go either through the [[H<U+00F6>lle Valley (Wetterstein)|H<U+00F6>llental]] ("Valley of Hell") or the Reintal. The way through the Reintal is the easiest, but also the longest and takes 8 to 10 hours. This path goes through the Partnachklamm, a scenic [[gorge]], then through the Reintal up to the Zugspitzplatt, a barren plateau. from there up to the summit. Climbers can stay for the night at two alpine huts, the "Reintalangerh<U+00FC>tte" or the "Knorrh<U+00FC>tte".

The more popular, but harder route is through the H<U+00F6>llental. It starts at Hammersbach near Garmisch, goes through the H<U+00F6>llentalklamm, a similar gorge up to the "H<U+00F6>llentalangerh<U+00FC>tte", where one can take a meal or stay for the night. It then crosses the [[H<U+00F6>llentalferner]], the remnants of a small glacier. After that it traverses a wall with the help of iron ladders and steps. ''[[Klettersteig]]'' equipment is recommended for that part. Over the Irmerscharte (a gap) it reaches the summit. This path will take 7 to 8 hours.

From the Austrian village of [[Ehrwald]], there are also two variants. One goes straight through the Western Flank, which is the shortest route overall, but rather hard. It includes a ''via ferrata'', and there is a hut called "Wiener Neust<U+00E4>dter H<U+00FC>tte" by the Austrian Alpine Club. An easier path leads via the Ehrwalder Alm, across a small pass called "Gatterl", joining the Reintal path at the Knorrh<U+00FC>tte.
