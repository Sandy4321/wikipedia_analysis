'''''James Dean''''' is a 2001 [[biographical film|biographical]] [[television movie]] based on the life of the actor [[James Dean|of the same name]].  [[James Franco]] plays James Dean under the direction of [[Mark Rydell]], who chronicles Dean's rise from a struggling actor to an [[A-list]] movie star in 1950s Hollywood. The film's supporting roles included director Rydell, [[Michael Moriarty]], [[Valentina Cervi]], [[Enrico Colantoni]], and Amy Rydell.

The ''James Dean'' biopic began development at [[Warner Bros.]] in the early 1990s. At one point, [[Michael Mann]] was contracted to direct with [[Leonardo DiCaprio]] starring in the lead role. After Mann's departure, [[Des McAnuff]], [[Dennis Hopper]] and [[Mil<U+010D>o Man<U+010D>evski]] were considered as directors. Mark Rydell was hired as director in 1996, but the film continued to languish in [[development hell]].

Warner Bros. then decided to produce ''James Dean'' as a TV movie for [[TNT (TV network)|Turner Network Television]] (TNT); both Warners and TNT are owned by [[Time Warner]]. James Franco was cast as Dean in May 2000 after a search that resulted in 500 auditions. Franco researched his role and pursued various [[method acting]] techniques to more closely portray Dean. ''James Dean'' showed on TNT in the United States on August 5, 2001, receiving generally positive reviews from critics.

==Plot==
At eight years old, James Dean lives with his estranged father Winton and mother Mildred in 1939 [[Santa Monica, California]]. When Mildred dies of cancer in 1940, Winton sends his son on a train to [[Fairmount, Indiana]], along with the coffin containing Mildred's body. Winton does not show up at the funeral, leaving James to be raised by his aunt and uncle on a farm in Fairmount. Over the years, James becomes more curious about his father's decision to abandon him. He tries to impress his father by sending him a package displaying his various athletic trophies in high school sports.

James moves back to Santa Monica in June 1949, shortly after high school graduation, and finds that his father has remarried. James decides to become an actor and takes classes under [[James Whitmore]]. Whitmore is impressed by James' [[method acting]] ability, which encourages James to move to [[New York City]] in September 1951 to pursue an acting career. Despite being a struggling actor, James enjoys the new lifestyle. He befriends fellow actor [[Martin Landau]] and has a romantic relationship with Christine White. Both James and Christine are accepted into the prestigious [[Actors Studio]]. James receives critical acclaim in [[Broadway theatre]] productions and for a role in a [[television movie]] drama that is broadcast nationwide. James tries to tell Winton about his successful rise in acting, but his father still reacts with indifference, causing more emotional turmoil for the actor.

Film producer-director [[Elia Kazan]] hires James for the leading role in ''[[East of Eden (film)|East of Eden]]'' (1955), marking James's Hollywood debut. James moves to Hollywood in April 1954 to begin filming for ''Eden'' and is introduced to [[Jack Warner]], the stern president of [[Warner Bros.|Warner Bros. Studios]] who is determined to transform James into a movie star. Warner becomes suspicious of James' personal life (such as his possible [[homosexuality]] and passions for auto racing and motorcycling). On the Warner Bros. [[backlot]], James falls in love with actress [[Pier Angeli]], who is working on the neighbored production of ''[[The Silver Chalice (film)|The Silver Chalice]]'' (1954).

Despite concerns from Pier's domineering mother, James and his girlfriend buy a [[beach house]] in which they live together. Meanwhile, eccentric director [[Nicholas Ray]] casts James in the lead role for ''[[Rebel Without a Cause]]'' (1955). James once again hopes to impress his father with his rising [[movie star]] career in Hollywood, but Winton persists with his indifference.  When ''East of Eden'' debuts, Warner is furious that James does not show up at the premiere.  Warner considers shutting down production of ''Rebel Without a Cause'', but he drops the idea due to James's praised performance in ''Eden''. Later, James finds out that Warner sided with Pier's mother over James's break up with Pier. She ends up marrying [[Vic Damone]], while James then signs a one million dollar contract with Warner Bros. and is cast in ''[[Giant (film)|Giant]]'' (1956). James' mental breakdowns become more apparent when he starts conflicting with director [[George Stevens]].

Angered with his life, James decides to learn the truth about his father's carelessness over his son since James was eight years old. Winton tells James that his real father was a man with whom James's mother had an affair during the marriage. Winton tells his son that he did not have the courage to raise James, not being his real father. With his inner demons resolved, James begins to enjoy life once more and adapt a friendly relationship with director Stevens. Shortly afterward, James dies in a tragic car accident that shocks both members of the film industry and the general public. En route on a train to Indiana, Winton sits next to his son's coffin in the storage room. Despite the fact that James is dead, Winton does not intend to abandon his son once more.

==Background==
===Writing===
In the early 1990s, [[Warner Bros.]] planned to produce a feature [[biographical film]] about actor [[James Dean]], and the studio hired [[Israel Horovitz]] to write the script.<ref name=early/>  One of the [[working title]]s was ''James Dean: An Invented Life'' before it was finalized as ''James Dean''.<ref name=cast/>  When Horovitz wrote the script, he explored the "psychological insight" of Dean by showcasing the abandonment of his father, which became the fulcrum of the storyline. Horovitz recalled, "Why would a father ship his wife's body back on a train with an 8-year-old son, never go to the funeral and never pick the son up again, never bring the son back out to him?"<ref name=Hell>{{cite news | author = Brad Schreiber | url = http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117868523 | title = Biographical sketches revitalize telepic world | work = [[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] | date = 2002-06-14 | accessdate = 2009-01-08}}</ref> The screenwriter felt it was best to portray Dean's [[homosexuality]] by [[innuendo]] rather than explicitly.  He wanted to focus on the romance between Dean and Pier Angeli and Dean's growth as an actor, and believed that a homosexuality subplot would distract from the storyline.  Producer [[Marvin Worth]] explained in July 1995, "We'll try to make a good movie... not one of rumor and innuendo."<ref name=gay>{{cite news | author = Army Archerd | url = http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117862518 | title = 'Lies' convinces H'w'd to invest | work = [[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] | date = 1994-07-19 | accessdate = 2009-01-08}}</ref>

===Production===
[[Michael Mann]] was contracted to direct ''James Dean'' in September 1993,<ref name=early>{{cite news | author = [[Army Archerd]] | url = http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117862256 | title = Robinson champions Bosnian cause | work = [[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] | date = 1993-09-08 | accessdate = 2009-01-08}}</ref> and filming was scheduled to start in May 1994.

[[Gary Oldman]] was also discussed for a supporting role.  In March 1994, Mann decided not to direct ''James Dean'' due to scheduling conflicts with ''[[Heat (1995 film)|Heat]]'' (1995).<ref>{{cite news | author = Michael Fleming | url = http://www.variety.com/article/VR119380 | title = Cost control: Making H'wood's tough calls | work = [[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] | date = 1994-03-21 | accessdate = 2009-01-08}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | author = Army Archerd | url = http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117862457 | title = Worth, Menken, McAnuff team for Disney tuner | work = [[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] | date = 1994-03-31 | accessdate = 2009-01-08}}</ref> Mann also thought that DiCaprio was too young and wanted to wait another year.<ref name=Gerber>{{cite news | author = Bernard Weinraub | title = Rebel Without a Film Biography ...

[[Des McAnuff]] replaced Mann as director, and filming was rescheduled to December 1994.<ref>{{cite news | author = Army Archerd | url = http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117862500 | title = 'Affair' looks to duplicate O.J. drama | work = [[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] | date = 1994-06-20 | accessdate = 2009-01-08}}</ref> Screenwriter Horovitz was busy [[playwright]]ing in Europe, so McAnuff and producer Marvin Worth were constantly rewriting the script in July 1994. The budget was estimated at $20 million.<ref name=gay/> McAnuff stepped down as director and was replaced by [[Dennis Hopper]]. Hopper was a close friend with Dean and co-starred with the actor in both ''[[Rebel Without a Cause]]'' and ''[[Giant (film)|Giant]]''. Hopper met with DiCaprio for the lead role, but the director eventually dropped out of the film.<ref>{{cite news | author = Army Archerd | url = http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117862605 | title = Hopper considers helming Dean biopic | work = [[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] | date = 1994-12-19 | accessdate = 2009-01-08}}</ref> By May 1995, DiCaprio was still the top candidate to portray Dean with [[Mil<U+010D>o Man<U+010D>evski]] in discussions to direct the film.<ref>{{cite news | author = Army Archerd | url = http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117862700 | title = Liz, lawyers take on NBC mini | work = [[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] | date = 1995-05-19 | accessdate = 2009-01-08}}</ref> 

After negotiations with Man<U+010D>evski fell through, [[Mark Rydell]] was contracted to direct the biopic in February 1996.<ref name=Ry/> Rydell was also close friends with Dean; the two studied together at [[Actors Studio]] in Manhattan, New York during the early 1950s.<ref name=Leo/> DiCaprio dropped out of the lead role entirely when his [[asking price]] was determined to be too high after the actor's success with ''[[Romeo + Juliet]]'' (1996) and ''[[Titanic (1997 film)|Titanic]]'' (1997).<ref name=Leo>{{cite news | author = Anita Gates | title = Wanted: Rebel to Fill the Shoes of a Giant |url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C0CE3DA103CF936A3575BC0A9679C8B63| work = [[The New York Times]] | date = 2001-08-05 | accessdate = 2009-01-10}}</ref> Meanwhile, Rydell worked with Horovitz on another rewrite, and Warner Bros. planned to [[fast track]] production.<ref name=Ry>{{cite news | author = Army Archerd | url = http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117862862 | title = Will puppy pic be on par with pig? | work = [[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] | date = 1996-02-15 | accessdate = 2009-01-08}}</ref> [[Don Was]] was hired to write and compose the [[film score]], but he was later replaced by [[John Frizzell]].<ref>{{cite news | author = Army Archerd | url = http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117863328 | title = WB dreamin' of Brian Wilson biopic | work = [[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] | date = 1997-01-10 | accessdate = 2009-01-08}}</ref> Shortly after Rydell's hiring, [[Stephen Dorff]] entered discussions to portray James Dean.<ref>{{cite news | author = Michael Fleming | url = http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117863107 | title = 'Gia's' Jolie shines in dark role | work = [[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] | date = 1997-07-23 | accessdate = 2009-01-08}}</ref> 

With the film languishing in [[development hell]], producer [[Bill Gerber]] from Warner Bros. decided ''James Dean'' would work best as a [[television movie]] for [[TNT (TV network)|Turner Network Television]] (TNT); both Warners and TNT are owned by [[Time Warner]].<ref name=Hell/><ref name=work>{{cite web | url = http://www.tnt.tv/movies/movietitle/?oid=585 | title = Movies on TNT: James Dean | work = [[TNT (TV network)|TNT]] | accessdate = 2009-01-08}}</ref> Gerber explained the format choice, "It was just hard to find [[A-list|bankable names]] that the studio would finance a $20 million movie with. And there were marketing problems. He died in a highway accident 1955 so almost everyone would know the outcome of the movie. James Dean also isn't that well known by the general movie-going public these days."<ref name=Gerber/> Actor [[James Franco]] was cast into the lead role, and [[principal photography]] for ''James Dean'' started in June 2000. Filming took place around the Los Angeles area and at the [[Sony Pictures Studios]] in [[Culver City, California|Culver City]].<ref name=cast>{{cite news | author = Paula Bernstein | url = http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117781438 | title = Franco to play Dean in TNT biopic | work = [[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] | date = 2000-05-10 | accessdate = 2009-01-08}}</ref>

| style="text-align: left;" | It was interesting because everyone I spoke to had a different perspective on James Dean.

Rydell and other filmmakers started a casting call in late March 2000 to find the most suitable actor for the lead role. The call encompassed New York, Los Angeles, Toronto, Vancouver, Atlanta, Chicago and the Midwestern United States. Casting director Nancy Foy commented that the search included "everyone from highly-trained, experienced actors in their early and mid-20s, to people who had no training and had sent in self-made tapes".<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.tnt.tv/movies/movietitle/?oid=1119 | title = Q&A With Nancy Foy | work = [[TNT (TV network)|TNT]] | accessdate = 2009-01-10}}</ref> Five hundred actors auditioned,<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.tnt.tv/movies/movietitle/?oid=1118 | title = Q&A With Mark Rydell | work = [[TNT (TV network)|TNT]] | accessdate = 2009-01-10}}</ref> and one of the top candidates was [[Ethan Hawke]], who later turned down the role because he questioned his ability to play an iconic actor.<ref name=Gerber/> James Franco was ultimately cast as James Dean in May 2000.<ref name=cast/> Franco acknowledged he was cautious of taking the role over fear of [[typecasting (acting)|typecasting]]<ref name=USA/>

Franco used a series of [[method acting]] techniques for his portrayal.  He went from being a non-smoker to smoking two packs of cigarettes a day, but has since quit the habit. He learned how to ride a motorcycle, play guitar, as well as the [[conga]] and [[bongo drum]]s.  The actor also carefully studied Dean's mannerisms by simultaneously watching his three films (''East of Eden'', ''Rebel Without a Cause'' and ''Giant'').  Franco also read numerous biographies on Dean's life.<ref name=USA>{{cite news | author = Kelly Carter | url = http://www.usatoday.com/life/television/2001-07-27-james-franco.htm | title = James Franco: The next James Dean | work = [[USA Today]] | date = 2001-07-26 | accessdate = 2009-01-09}}</ref> The actor also took advice from some of Dean's closest friends, including [[Martin Landau]], [[Dennis Hopper]], [[Liz Sheridan]] (Dean's former girlfriend) and [[Leonard Rosenman]]. "Martin was the most informative person that I spoke too. He helped me tremendously with James's physical mannerisms," Franco reflected. "I isolated myself a lot during the filming. I did this because I think he had a pervasive loneliness throughout his life and I wanted to feel what that felt like. Not talking to my family or loved ones had quite an emotional effect on me."<ref name=method>{{cite web | url = http://www.tnt.tv/movies/movietitle/?oid=1117 | title = Q&A With James Franco | work = [[TNT (TV network)|TNT]] | accessdate = 2009-01-10}}</ref>
