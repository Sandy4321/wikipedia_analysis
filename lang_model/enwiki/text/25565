The '''Philippines''' ({{lang-fil|Pilipinas|}} {{IPA-tl|p<U+026A>l<U+026A><U+02C8>pin<U+0250>s|}}), officially known as the '''Republic of the Philippines''' ({{lang-fil|Republika ng Pilipinas|}}), is a country in [[Southeast Asia]] in the [[western Pacific Ocean]].  [[Taiwan]] lies north across the [[Luzon Strait]]. West across the [[South China Sea]] sits [[Vietnam]].  The [[Sulu Sea]] to the southwest lies between the country and the island of [[Borneo]], and to the south the [[Celebes Sea]] separates it from other islands of [[Indonesia]]. It is bounded on the east by the [[Philippine Sea]].  An archipelago comprising 7,107 islands, the Philippines is categorized broadly into three main geographical divisions: [[Luzon]], [[Visayas]], and [[Mindanao]]. Its capital city is [[Manila]].

With an estimated population of about 92&nbsp;million people, the Philippines is [[List of countries by population|the world's 12th most populous country]].  It is estimated that there are an additional 11&nbsp;million [[overseas Filipinos]] worldwide.  Multiple [[Ethnic groups in the Philippines|ethnicities]] and cultures are found throughout the islands.  It has a tropical climate and is one of the richest areas of biodiversity in the world.

The [[Negritos]] of prehistoric times were one of the archipelago's earliest inhabitants.  They were followed by [[Wave migration theory|successive waves]] of [[Austronesian peoples]] who brought with them influences from [[Malay people|Malay]], [[Hindu]], and [[Islamic]] cultures. Trade introduced [[Culture of China|Chinese]] cultural influences.  The arrival of [[Ferdinand Magellan]] in 1521 marked the beginning of an era of [[Spain|Spanish]] interest, and eventual dominance.  The Philippines became the Asian hub of the [[Manila galleon|Manila<U+2013>Acapulco galleon]] [[Spanish treasure fleet|treasure fleet]]. [[Christianity]] became widespread.  As the 19th&nbsp;century gave way to the 20th, there followed in quick succession the short-lived [[Philippine Revolution]], the [[Spanish-American War]], and the [[Philippine-American War]]. 

In the aftermath, the [[United States]] replaced [[Spain]] as the dominant power. Aside from the period of [[Japanese occupation of the Philippines|Japanese occupation]], the United States retained sovereignty over the islands until the end of [[World War II]] when the Philippines gained [[Philippine independence|independence]]. The United States bequeathed to the Philippines the English language and an affinity for Western culture. Since independence the Philippines has had an often tumultuous experience with [[democracy]] and [[political corruption]], with popular "[[People power|People Power]]" movements overthrowing a [[Ferdinand_Marcos#Dictatorship|dictatorship]] in one instance but also underlining the institutional weaknesses of its [[constitutional republic]] in [[EDSA_II#Criticism|others]].

==Etymology==
{{Main|Name of the Philippines}}
<!--Please suggest changes through the talk page. Thanks.-->

The name ''Philippines'' is derived from that of [[Philip II of Spain|King Philip&nbsp;II of Spain]].  Spanish explorer [[Ruy L<U+00F3>pez de Villalobos]] during his expedition in 1542 named the islands of [[Leyte]] and [[Samar]] ''Felipinas'' after the then Prince of [[Asturias]] (Spain).  Eventually the name ''Las Islas Filipinas'' would be used to cover all the islands of the archipelago.  Before it became commonplace, other names such as ''Islas del Poniente'' (Islands of the West) and Magellan's name for the islands ''San L<U+00E1>zaro'' were also used by the Spanish to refer to the islands.<ref>{{Cite book |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=15KZU-yMuisC|title=Barangay: Sixteenth-century Philippine Culture and Society|author=Scott, William Henry.|authorlink=William Henry Scott (historian)|publisher=Ateneo de Manila University Press

The official name of the Philippines has changed several times in the course of the country's history.  During the [[Philippine Revolution]], the [[Malolos Congress]] proclaimed the establishment of the ''Rep<U+00FA>blica Filipina'' or the ''[[First Philippine Republic|Philippine Republic]]''. From the period of the [[Spanish-American War]] and the [[Philippine-American War]] until the [[Commonwealth of the Philippines|Commonwealth]] period, American colonial authorities referred to the country as the ''Philippine Islands'', a translation of the Spanish name.  During the American period the name ''Philippines'' began to appear and it has since become the country's common name.<ref name =PhilIs>[[Manuel Quezon III|Quezon, Manuel, III]]. (2005-03-28).

Retrieved 2009-12-20.</ref> The official name of the country is now ''Republic of the Philippines''.

Spanish rule contributed significantly to bringing political unity to the archipelago.  From 1565 to 1821, the Philippines was governed as a territory of the [[Viceroyalty of New Spain]] and then was administered directly from [[Madrid]] after the [[Mexican War of Independence]]. The [[Manila galleons]] linking Manila to [[Acapulco]] traveled once or twice a year between the 16th and 19th&nbsp;century.  Trade introduced foods such as [[maize|corn]], [[tomatoes]], [[potatoes]], [[chili peppers]], and [[pineapples]] from the Americas.<ref name="JoaquinPhilBecoming" /> [[Roman Catholic]] missionaries converted most of the lowland inhabitants to [[Christianity]] and founded schools, a university, and hospitals. While a Spanish decree introduced free public schooling in 1863, efforts in mass public education mainly came to fruition during the American period.<ref>Dolan, Ronald E. (Ed.). (1991).

During its rule, the Spanish fought off various [[Philippine revolts against Spain|indigenous revolts]] and several external colonial challenges from Chinese pirates, the Dutch, and the Portuguese.

[[File:Filipino Ilustrados Jose Rizal Marcelo del Pilar Mariano Ponce.jpg|thumb|right|Jos<U+00E9> Rizal, Marcelo del Pilar, and Mariano Ponce: leaders of the Propaganda Movement]]In the 1800s, Philippine ports were opened to world trade and shifts were occurring within Philippine society.  Many Spaniards born in the Philippines (''[[criollos]]'') and those of mixed ancestry (''[[mestizos]]'') became wealthy. The influx of Spanish and Latino settlers secularized churches and opened up government positions traditionally held by Spaniards born in the [[Iberian Peninsula]] (''[[peninsulares]]'').  The ideals of the [[French Revolution]] also began to spread through the islands.

Immediately after [[World War II]], the Philippines faced a number of challenges.  The country had to be rebuilt from the ravages of war.  It also had to come to terms with Japanese collaborators.  Meanwhile, disgruntled remnants of the [[Hukbalahap]] communist rebel army that had previously fought against and resisted the Japanese continued to roam the rural [[Regions of the Philippines|regions]].  Eventually this threat was dealt with by Secretary of National Defense and later President [[Ramon Magsaysay]] but sporadic cases of communist insurgency continued to flare up long afterward.<ref name=Chandler>{{cite book

Relations with other nations are generally positive.  Shared democratic values ease relations with Western and European countries while similar economic concerns help in relations with other developing countries.  Historical ties and cultural similarities also serve as a bridge in relations with Spain and [[Latin America]]. Despite issues such as [[domestic abuse]] and war affecting [[overseas Filipino]] workers and obstacles posed by Islamic insurgency in Mindanao, relations with [[Middle East]]ern countries (including [[Egypt]], [[Iran]], [[Iraq]], [[Libya]], [[Saudi Arabia]], and the [[United Arab Emirates]]) are friendly as seen in the continuous employment of more than two million overseas Filipinos living there.  

With communism no longer the threat it once was, once hostile relations in the 1950s between the Philippines and the [[People's Republic of China]] have improved greatly.

The island of [[Borneo]] is located a few hundred kilometers southwest and [[Taiwan]] is located directly to the north. The [[Moluccas]] and [[Sulawesi]] are located to the south-southwest and [[Palau]] is located to the east of the islands.<ref name="About">[http://www.gov.ph/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=200020&Itemid=26 General Information].

Most of the mountainous islands are covered in [[tropical rainforest]] and volcanic in origin. The highest mountain is [[Mount Apo]]. It measures up to 2,954&nbsp;meters (9,692&nbsp;feet) above sea level and is located on the island of Mindanao.  The longest river is the [[Cagayan River]] in northern Luzon.  [[Manila Bay]], upon the shore of which the capital city of Manila lies, is connected to [[Laguna de Bay]], the largest lake in the Philippines, by the [[Pasig River]]. [[Subic Bay]], the [[Davao Gulf]], and the [[Moro Gulf]] are other important bays. The [[San Juanico Strait]] separates the islands of Samar and Leyte but it is traversed by the [[San Juanico Bridge]].<ref>Republic of the Philippines. Department of Tourism. [ca. 2008].

Traditional festivities known as ''barrio fiestas'' (district festivals) to commemorate the feast days of patron saints are common.  The [[Moriones Festival]] and [[Sinulog festival|Sinulog Festival]] are a couple of the most well-known.  These community celebrations are times for feasting, music, and dancing.  Some traditions, however, are changing or gradually being forgotten due to modernization.  The [[Bayanihan Philippine National Folk Dance Company]] has been lauded for preserving many of the various traditional folk dances found throughout the Philippines.  They are famed for their iconic performances of Philippine dances such as the ''[[tinikling]]'' and ''[[singkil]]'' that both feature the use of clashing bamboo poles.<ref name="lonelyplanet44">

However, a Spanish name and surname does not necessarily denote Spanish ancestry.

Philippine cuisine has evolved over several centuries from its [[Malayo-Polynesian]] origins to become a mixed cuisine with many [[Hispanic]], [[Chinese cuisine|Chinese]], [[Cuisine of the United States|American]], and other [[Asian cuisine|Asian]] influences that have been adapted to local ingredients and the Filipino palate to create distinctively Filipino dishes.  Dishes range from the very simple, like a meal of fried salted fish and rice, to the elaborate, such as the ''[[paella]]s'' and ''[[cozido|cocidos]]'' created for fiestas.  Popular dishes include ''[[lech<U+00F3>n]]'', ''[[Adobo (Filipino cuisine)|adobo]]'', ''[[sinigang]]'', ''[[kare-kare]]'', ''[[Tapa (Filipino cuisine)|tapa]]'', crispy ''pata'', ''[[pancit]]'', ''[[lumpia]]'', and ''[[halo-halo]]''.  Some common local ingredients used in cooking are [[calamondin]]s, coconuts, ''saba'' (a kind of short wide [[plantain]]), [[mangoes]], [[milkfish]], and [[fish sauce]].  Filipino taste buds tend to favor robust flavors but the cuisine is not as spicy as those of its neighbors.<ref name=Jollibee2/><ref name=Zialcita>

Unlike many of their Asian counterparts, Filipinos do not eat with chopsticks; they use western cutlery.  However, possibly due to rice being the primary staple food and the popularity of a large number of stews or broth-based main dishes in Philippine cuisine, the main pairing of utensils seen at the Filipino dining table is that of spoon and fork, not knife and fork.<ref name="lonelyplanet48">

<!--Please suggest changes through the talk page. Thanks.-->

Philippine mythology has been handed down primarily through the traditional oral folk literature of the Filipino people.  While each unique ethnic group has its own stories and myths to tell Hindu and Spanish influence can nonetheless be detected in many cases.  Many of the myths are creation stories or stories about supernatural creatures, such as the ''[[aswang]]'' (vampire), the ''[[diwata]]'' (fairy), and Nature.  Some popular figures from Philippine mythologies are [[Maria Makiling]], [[Biag ni Lam-Ang|Lam-Ang]], and the [[sarimanok]].<ref name=Lopez>{{cite book

Philippine literature comprises works usually written in Filipino, Spanish, or English.  Some of the most known were created in the 19th&nbsp;century.  [[Francisco Balagtas]] the poet and playwright who wrote ''[[Florante at Laura]]'' is recognized as a preeminent writer in the Filipino language.  [[Jos<U+00E9> Rizal]] wrote the novels ''[[Noli Me Tangere (novel)|Noli Me Tangere]]'' (''Touch Me Not''), and ''[[El Filibusterismo]]'' (''The Reign of Greed'') and is considered a national hero.  His depiction of the injustices of Spanish rule and death by firing squad inspired other Philippine revolutionaries to seek independence.  In the 20th&nbsp;century, among those officially recognized as [[National Artists of the Philippines]] in literature are [[N.V.M. Gonzalez]], [[Nick Joaquin]], [[F. Sionil Jose]], and [[Alejandro Roces]].<ref name=Artists>Republic of the Philippines. National Commission for Culture and the Arts.
