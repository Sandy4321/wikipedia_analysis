The district consists of 10 contributing buildings originally built between 1844 and 1883, with later additions and modifications.  It is reflective of Rochester's early commercial and industrial development as an [[Erie Canal]]-oriented boom town.  It includes a block long group of three story, brick commercial buildings, known as the Teoronto-Smith Block. They consist of nine five bay buildings with a continuous gable roof.  Also in the district is a set of attached commercial / industrial buildings.<ref name="nrhpinv_ny">{{cite web|url=http://www.oprhp.state.ny.us/hpimaging/hp_view.asp?GroupView=4328|title=National Register of Historic Places Registration: Teoronto Block Historic District|date=February 2010|accessdate=2011-05-14 |author=Robert T.
