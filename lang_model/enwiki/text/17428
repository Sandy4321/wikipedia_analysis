Since the ''Protocols'' appeared, its earliest publishers have offered vague and often contradictory testimony detailing how they obtained their copy of the rumored original manuscript.<ref>John Spargo, "The Jew and American Ideals".

The work was popularized by those opposed to revolution, and was disseminated further after the [[Russian Revolution of 1905]], becoming known worldwide after the 1917 [[October Revolution]]. It was widely circulated in the [[Western world|West]] in [[1920]] and thereafter. The [[Great Depression]] was an important development in the history of the ''Protocols'', and the text continued to be published and circulated despite its de-bunking as a [[plagiarism]], [[fabrication]], [[forgery]], and [[hoax]]. 

Continued usage of the ''Protocols'' as a [[propaganda]] tool substantially diminished with the defeat of the [[Nazism|Nazis]] in [[World War II]], although it still has currency in the arsenal of contemporary antisemitism.

==Title==

The text is alternatively known in English as ''Protocols of the Wise Men of Zion'', ''Protocols of the Learned Elders of Zion'', ''Protocols of the Meetings of the Learned Elders of Zion'', ''Protocols of the Sages of Zion'', ''Protocols of Zion'', ''Jewish Peril'', ''Protocols and World Revolution'', and ''[[Praemonitus praemunitus]]''.  The variation in title derives partly from the fact that the book has two titles in Russian - {{lang|ru|"<U+0421><U+0438><U+043E><U+043D><U+0441><U+043A><U+0438><U+0435> <U+043F><U+0440><U+043E><U+0442><U+043E><U+043A><U+043E><U+043B><U+044B>"}} (''Sionskiye protokoly'', lit. "Protocols of Zion") and {{lang|ru|"<U+041F><U+0440><U+043E><U+0442><U+043E><U+043A><U+043E><U+043B><U+044B> <U+0441><U+0438><U+043E><U+043D><U+0441><U+043A><U+0438><U+0445> <U+043C><U+0443><U+0434><U+0440><U+0435><U+0446><U+043E><U+0432>"}} (''Protokoly sionskih mudretsov'', lit. "Protocols of the Sages of Zion") - and partly due to the different translations of the Russian word {{lang|ru|<U+043C><U+0443><U+0434><U+0440><U+0435><U+0446>}} (''mudrets'', a wise man or a sage).

However, the variation in title also derives from the fact that its various (often un-named) compilers or editors give it a different "main title" (as distinct from the "subtitles"), as well as the interest of these to advertise or suit their particular anti-Semitic agenda, and the fact that the text, which consists roughly of no more than 2 or 3 dozen paragraphs is only sufficient for a "pamphlet", and it becomes a "book" by expansion with prefaces, introductions, adenda, etc.

For example, the first American [[English language]] edition, published in [[Boston]] in [[1920]] by Small, Maynard & Company, has the following full title:

     THE PROTOCOLS AND WORLD REVOLUTION
     INCLUDING A TRANSLATION AND ANALYSIS OF THE
     "PROTOCOLS OF THE MEETINGS OF THE ZIONIST MEN OF WISDOM"

This first American officially published edition (there were hundreds of manuscripts and/or galleies already in circulation by [[1919]]) has no Table of Contents. Nevertheless, leafing through this "hardback" book reveals that only pages 11 through 73 contain the so-called "Protocols" which are 24 in number--consecutively numbered with Roman numerals. It is to be noted that the word "[[Zion]]" in this first American edition has ''not'' been used; rather, the word "[[Zionist]]" is used. This contrasts to a similar practice of the prior Russian editions. For example, in [[1905]] the text of these so-called "Protocols" constituted the final twelfth chapter of the author's book, [[Sergei Nilus|Serge Nilus]], on the imminent arrival of the [[anti-Christ]]; ("The Big within the Small").

==Origins and content==
=== Maurice Joly===
Much of the text in the ''Protocols'' appears to be directly plagiarized from an 1864 pamphlet, [[The Dialogue in Hell Between Machiavelli and Montesquieu|''Dialogue aux enfers entre Machiavel et Montesquieu'']] (''Dialogue in Hell Between [[Machiavelli]] and [[Charles de Secondat, Baron de Montesquieu|Montesquieu]]''), written by the French satirist [[Maurice Joly]]. Joly's work attacks the political ambitions of [[Napoleon III]] using the device of diabolical plotters in [[Hell]] as stand-ins for Napoleon's views. Joly himself appears to have borrowed material from a popular novel by [[Eug<U+00E8>ne Sue]], ''The Mysteries of the People,'' in which the plotters were [[Society of Jesus|Jesuits]]. Jews do not appear in either work. Since it was illegal to criticize the monarchy, Joly had the pamphlet printed in [[Belgium]], then tried to smuggle it back into France. The police confiscated as many copies as they could, and it was banned. After it was traced to Joly, he was tried on [[April 25]], [[1865]], and sentenced to fifteen months in prison.
=== Hermann Goedsche===
[[Hermann Goedsche]]'s 1868 fiction novel, ''Biarritz,'' contributed another idea that may have inspired the scribe behind the Protocols. In the chapter, "In the Jewish Cemetery in Prague," Goedsche wrote about a nocturnal meeting between members of a mysterious rabbinical [[cabal]], describing how at midnight, the Devil appears before those who have gathered on behalf of the [[Twelve Tribes of Israel]] to plan a "Jewish conspiracy." His depiction is also similar to the scene in [[Alexandre Dumas]]'s ''Joseph Balsamo'', where [[Cagliostro]] and company plot the [[affair of the diamond necklace]]. With ''Biarritz'' appearing at about the same time as ''The Dialogue in Hell Between Machiavelli and Montesquieu,'' it is possible that Goedsche was inspired by the ideas in Joly's pamphlet, especially in detailing the outcome of the cabal's secret meeting.<ref name=Graves1921>This material was originally exposed by Philip Graves in "The Source of ''The Protocols of Zion'' published in ''The Times,'' 16, 17 & 18 August 1921, and has since been expanded in many sources.</ref> Goedsche, a reactionary to the events of [[Revolutions of 1848|1848]], lost his job in the Prussian postal service after forging evidence to implicate democratic leader [[Benedict Waldeck]] of conspiring against the king. Following his dismissal, Goedsche began a career as a [[monarchist|conservative]] columnist, while also producing literary work under the penname [[Sir John Retcliffe]].<ref name=Cohn1966>Norman Cohn, ''Warrant for Genocide: The Myth of the Jewish World-Conspiracy and the Protocols of the Elder of Zion'' (New York: Harper & Row Publishers, 1966) 32-36.</ref>
Goedsche was allegedly a spy for the [[Prussian]] Secret Police.

===Structure and themes===
The twenty-four Protocols are posited as instructions to a new Elder, outlining how the group will control the world. The Elders want to trick all "gentile nations," whom they call "[[goy]]im," into doing their will. Their preferred methods include:

{| class="wikitable"

|}

Control of the media and finance would replace the traditional sources of [[social order]] with one based on mass manipulation and state engineered propaganda, where powerful elites and institutions conspire to conceal unpalatable truths from the masses. In these respects, the Protocols draw on long-standing criticisms of [[modernity]], [[radicalism]] and [[capitalism]], but present them as part of an orchestrated plot, rather than as a product of impersonal historical processes.

The text assumes that the reader already believes that the [[Freemason]]s are a secret society with a hidden political agenda, and the ''Protocols'' purport to demonstrate that this hidden agenda is itself controlled or guided by the 'Elders,' a sort of conspiracy theory within a conspiracy theory. In the ''Protocols'', Freemasons and "liberal thinkers" are shown to be mere tools that the Elders will eventually replace with a Jewish [[theocracy]]. The ''Protocols'' describe a forthcoming "kingdom" and go into great lengths about how it will be run. Yet even in this kingdom the Elders will avoid direct political control, preferring to assert themselves via [[usury]] and manipulation of money. Even the "King of the Jews" himself will be nothing more than a [[Figurehead (metaphor)|figurehead]].

===Excerpts===
The ''Protocols'' 1-19 closely follow the order of the ''Dialogues in Hell...'' 1-17, with a few exceptions. In some places, [[plagiarism]] is incontrovertible:
{| class="wikitable"
| width=50% | <blockquote style="margin:1em; font-size:smaller;">
''Montesquieu'': How are loans made? By the issue of bonds entailing on the Government the obligation to pay interest proportionate to the capital it has been paid. Thus, if a loan is at 5%, the State, after 20 years, has paid out a sum equal to the borrowed capital. When 40 years have expired it has paid double, after 60 years triple: yet it remains debtor for the entire capital sum. (''Dialogues'', p. 250)
</blockquote>
| width=50% | <blockquote style="margin:1em; font-size:smaller;">
A loan is an issue of Government paper which entails an obligation to pay interest amounting to a percentage of the total sum of the borrowed money. If a loan is at 5%, then in 20 years the Government would have unnecessarily paid out a sum equal to that of the loan in order to cover the percentage. In 40 years it will have paid twice; and in 60 thrice that amount, but the loan will still remain as an unpaid debt. (''Protocols'', p. 77)
</blockquote>
|}

Another example is the reference to the [[Hindu]] deity, [[Vishnu]], which appears exactly twice in both the ''Dialogues in Hell...'' and the ''Protocols'':
{| class="wikitable"
| width=50% | <blockquote style="margin:1em; font-size:smaller;">
''Machiavelli'': Like the god Vishnu, my press will have a hundred arms, and these arms will give their hands to all the different shades of opinion throughout the country. (''Dialogues'', p. 141)<ref>Hindus do not actually believe that Vishnu has more than two arms.</ref>
</blockquote>
| width=50% | <blockquote style="margin:1em; font-size:smaller;">
These newspapers, like the Indian god Vishnu, will be possessed of hundreds of hands, each of which will be feeling the pulse of varying public opinion. (''Protocols'', p. 43)
</blockquote>
|}
{| class="wikitable"
| width=50% | <blockquote style="margin:1em; font-size:smaller;">
''Montesquieu'': Now I understand the figure of the god Vishnu; you have a hundred arms like the Indian idol, and each of your fingers touches a spring. (''Dialogues'', p. 207)
</blockquote>
| width=50% | <blockquote style="margin:1em; font-size:smaller;">
Our Government will resemble the Hindu god Vishnu. Each of our hundred hands will hold one spring of the social machinery of State. (''Protocols'', p. 65)
</blockquote>
|}

In addition to mentioning Vishnu, improbable in the Jewish religious literature, and the lack of [[Talmud]]ic citations that would be expected in it, textual references to the "[[King of the Jews]]," the semi-messianic idea that carries strong connotations of [[Jesus]], further suggest the author was not well-versed in Jewish culture, as this term has been avoided in the Judaic tradition since the [[Schisms among the Jews#Break-offs: Samaritans and Christians|schism]] between [[Judaism]] and [[Christianity]].<ref name=INRI>See [[INRI]], [[Jewish Messiah]], [[Judaism's view of Jesus]].</ref>

Once [[Philip Graves]]' ''Times'' article showed the extent of the similarity between the two texts, it became clear that the ''Protocols'' were not authentic.

===Conspiracy references===
The idea that the Freemasons formed part of an anti-Christian conspiracy, either separate from or in association with Jews, long predated the spreading of The Protocols. In the late 18th-early 19th centuries, Freemasonry was popular (as were many [[fraternal organization]]s), and its most significant opponent, the [[Roman Catholicism|Roman Catholic Church]], opposed its open support for [[freedom of religion]] and [[age of Enlightenment|enlightenment ideals]].

After some interaction with masons, a Scottish natural philosopher [[John Robison (Scotland)|John Robison]] became an enthusiastic conspiracy theorist and expanded on his impressions in his [[1797]] pamphlet ''Proofs of a Conspiracy against all the Religions and Governments of Europe, carried on in the secret meetings of Freemasons, Illuminati and Reading Societies.'' He did not take into account that French masons were members of several mutually hostile factions and that many of them were executed by their rivals. Robison's work does not mention Jews. 

[[Jesuit]] [[catholic priest|priest]] [[Augustin Barru<U+00E9>l|Abb<U+00E9> Barru<U+00E9>l]] had some contact with Robison, but extended the notion to include Jews. He had accused the Jews of founding the [[Illuminati#The Bavarian Illuminati|Bavarian Illuminati]], a movement of [[freethought|freethinkers]] that were the most radical offshoot of [[The Enlightenment]], and who had ties to the Masons.{{needs citation}}

The Protocols are widely considered influential in the development of other [[conspiracy theories]], and reappear repeatedly in contemporary conspiracy literature, such as [[Jim Marrs]]'s ''Rule by Secrecy.'' Some recent editions proclaim that the "Jews" depicted in the Protocols are a cover identity for other conspirators such as the [[Illuminati]], [[Freemason]]s, the [[Priory of Sion]], or even, in the opinion of [[David Icke]], "extra-dimensional entities." Other groups that believe in their authenticity have claimed that the book does not depict the way that Jews think and act, but only those belonging to an alleged secret elite group of [[Zionism|Zionists]], and that the "Elders" were not Rabbis, but secular Zionist leaders.

==Historical publications, usage, and investigations==
{{Antisemitism}}
===Emergence in Russia===
The chapter "In the Jewish Cemetery in Prague" from Goedsche's ''Biarritz'', with its strong [[anti-semitic]] theme containing the alleged rabbinical plot against the [[Europe]]an civilization, was translated into [[Russian language|Russian]] as a separate pamphlet in 1872.<ref>Segel, Binjamin W.

Recent research by Russian historian [[Mikhail Lepekhine]] traced the Protocols to [[Matvei Golovinski]], [[agent provocateur]] of [[Okhranka]], as part of a scheme to persuade [[Tsar]] [[Nicholas II of Russia|Nicholas II]] that the modernization of Russia was really a Jewish plot to control the world. Lepekhine discovered Golovinski's authorship in Russia's long-closed archives and published his findings in November 1999 in the French newsweekly ''[[L'Express (France)|L'Express]]''.<ref>{{fr icon}}[http://www.phdn.org/antisem/protocoles/origines.html <U+00C9>ric Conan.

A [[Ukrainians|Ukrainian]] scholar [[Vadim Skuratovsky]] offers extensive literary, historical and linguistic analysis of the original text of the ''Protocols'' and traces the influences of [[Fyodor Dostoyevsky]]'s prose (in particular, ''[[The Grand Inquisitor]]'' and ''[[The Possessed]]'') on Golovinski's writings, including the Protocols.<ref name=Skuratovsky>Vadim Skuratovsky: ''The Question of the Authorship of "The Protocols of the Elders of Zion."'' (Judaica Institute, Kiev, 2001) ISBN 966-7273-12-1</ref> 

In his book ''The Non-Existent Manuscript. A Study of the Protocols of the Sages of Zion,'' [[Italy|Italian]] researcher [[Cesare G. De Michelis]] writes<ref>{{ru icon}}[http://www.jewniverse.ru/RED/Skuratovski/2.htm Extensive cites from Michelis in the book of Vadim Skuratovsky]</ref> that hypothesis of Golovinski authorship was based on statement by Princess [[Catherine Radziwill]]. She claimed that she had seen a manuscript of the protocols written by Golovinsky, [[Pyotr Rachkovsky|Rachkovsky]] and Manusevich in 1905, but in 1905 Golovinsky and Rachkovsky had already left [[Paris]] and moved to [[Saint Petersburg]]. Princess Radziwill was known to be an unreliable source.

The Protocols were first mentioned in the Russian press on April 1902, in the Saint Petersburg newspaper, ''Novoye Vremya''(''<U+041D><U+043E><U+0432><U+043E><U+0435> <U+0412><U+0440><U+0435><U+043C><U+044F>'' - ''The New Times''). The article was written by a famous conservative publicist [[Mikhail Menshikov]] as a part of his regular series "Letters to Neighbors" ("<U+041F><U+0438><U+0441><U+044C><U+043C><U+0430> <U+043A> <U+0431><U+043B><U+0438><U+0436><U+043D><U+0438><U+043C>") and was entitled "Plots against Humanity." The author described his meeting with a lady ([[Yuliana Glinka]], as it is known now) who, after telling him about her mystical revelations, implored him to get familiar with the documents later known as the ''Protocols''; but after reading some excerpts Menshikov became quite skeptical about their origin and did not publish them.<ref Cohn-afterword>{{ru icon}}[http://www.vehi.net/asion/kon/08.html#_ftnref14 T. Karasova and D. Chernyakhovsky. Afterword to the Russian translation of Norman Cohn's ''Warrant for Genocide'']</ref>

====First printing and Nilus edition====
The Protocols were first published abridged in series from [[August 28]] to [[September 7]] ([[O.S.]]), 1903 in ''[[Znamya (newspaper)|Znamya]]'' (''<U+0417><U+043D><U+0430><U+043C><U+044F>'' - ''The Banner''), a Saint Petersburg daily newspaper, under [[Pavel Krushevan]]. Krushevan had initiated the [[Kishinev pogrom]] four months earlier.<ref name=Kadzhaya>[http://www.newtimes.ru/eng/detail.asp?art_id=470 ''The Fraud of a Century, or a book born in hell''], by Valery Kadzhaya (Retrieved Sept 2005)</ref>

The Protocols enjoyed another wave of popularity in Russia after 1905, when [[Russian Revolution of 1905|progressive political elements]] in Russia succeeded in creating a [[constitution]] and a [[parliament]], the [[Duma]]. The reactionary [[Union of the Russian People]], known as the [[Black Hundreds]], together with the [[Okhranka]], the Tsarist secret police, blamed this liberalization on the "International Jewish conspiracy," and began a program of disseminating the Protocols as [[propaganda]] to support the wave of [[pogroms]] that swept Russia in 1903<U+2013>1906 and as a tool to deflect attention from social activism. It also was of interest to [[Tsar]] [[Nicholas II of Russia|Nicholas II]], who was fearful of modernization and protective of his monarchy, and he presented the growing revolutionary movement as part of a powerful world conspiracy and blamed the Jews for Russia's problems.

[[Image:1912ed TheProtocols by Nilus.jpg|thumb|180px|1912 edition of Nilus's book ''The Great in the Small'' included the Protocols. The signs among [[occult]] symbols read: "Thus we shall win," "Mark of [[antichrist]]," "[[Tetragrammaton]]," "[[INRI]]," "[[Tarot]]," "Great mystery," etc.]]
In 1905, self-proclaimed [[mysticism|mystic]] [[priest]] [[Sergei Nilus]] gained fame by publishing the full text of the ''Protocols'' in the appendix of the third edition of his book ''The Great in the Small: The Coming of the Anti-Christ and the Rule of Satan on Earth''. He claimed it was the work of the [[First Zionist Congress]], held eight years earlier in [[Basel, Switzerland]]. When it was pointed out that the First Zionist Congress had been open to the public and was attended by many non-Jews, Nilus changed his story, saying the Protocols were the work of the 1902<U+2013>1903 meetings of the Elders, but contradicting his own prior statement that he had received his copy in 1901:
<blockquote>
''In 1901, I succeeded through an acquaintance of mine (the late Court Marshal Alexei Nikolayevich Sukotin of [[Chernigov]]) in getting a manuscript that exposed with unusual perfection and clarity the course and development of the secret Jewish Freemasonic conspiracy, which would bring this wicked world to its inevitable end. The person who gave me this manuscript guaranteed it to be a faithful translation of the original documents that were stolen by a woman from one of the highest and most influential leaders of the Freemasons at a secret meeting somewhere in France&mdash;the beloved nest of Freemasonic conspiracy.''<ref name=Kominsky1970>[[Morris Kominsky]], ''The Hoaxers'', 1970. p. 209 ISBN 0-8283-1288-5</ref>
</blockquote>

Nilus also had personal motivations for publishing them. At the time he was trying to become the royal couple's [[confessor]] and brought his book to the Tsar's attention with the help of the [[Grand Duchess Elizabeth Fyodorovna|Grand Duchess Elizaveta Fyodorovna]]. This was part of a faction fight against [[Papus]] and [[Nizier Anthelme Philippe]] at the Tsarist court. (Indeed, Papus was accused in 1920 of having forged the ''Protocols'' to discredit Philippe.) Nicholas II's notes handwritten in the margins are the evidence of his first reaction:
:''"What precise execution of their programme!"'',
:''"[[Russian Revolution of 1905|Our 1905]] was clearly orchestrated by the Zion Elders!"'',
:''"The Jews' guiding and destroying hand is visible everywhere"''.

====Stolypin's fraud investigation, 1905====
A subsequent secret investigation ordered by the newly appointed chairman of the Council of Ministers [[Pyotr Stolypin]] soon determined that the Protocols were authored by operatives of the [[Okhranka]] in [[Paris]]. The details were not made public to avoid compromising the chief of the secret service [[Pyotr Rachkovsky]] and his agents, including [[Matvei Golovinski|Golovinski]]. When Nicholas II learned of the results of this investigation, he requested: "The Protocols should be confiscated, a good cause cannot be defended by dirty means."<ref name=Burtsev1938>{{ru icon}} [http://www.jewniverse.ru/RED/Burtsev/BPSM-1-4.htm The Protocols of the Elders of Zion: A Proved Forgery] by [[Vladimir Burtsev]] (Paris, 1938) p.106 (Ch.4)</ref> Despite the order, or because of the "good cause," numerous reprints proliferated.<ref name=Kadzhaya/>

===The Russian Revolution and the spread of the Protocols, 1920s===
[[Image:Protocols of the Elders of Zion 1927 Paris Ru emig.jpg|thumb|150px|1927 ed. by Russian emigrants in Paris portrays the [[Bolshevik Revolution]] as a "Jewish plot"]]
After the [[Russian Revolution of 1917|Russian Revolution]], factions connected to the [[White movement]] used the ''Protocols'' to perpetrate hatred and violence against the Jews. The idea that the Bolshevik movement was a Jewish conspiracy for [[world domination]], plus the fact that some top Bolsheviks, particularly [[Leon Trotsky]], were indeed Jews, sparked worldwide interest in the ''Protocols''.

===English language publication===

The most widespread [[English language|English]] translation of the ''Protocols'' is credited to a British correspondent for ''[[The Morning Post]]'' in Russia, [[Victor E. Marsden]], who was imprisoned by the Bolsheviks in the [[Peter and Paul Fortress]], subsequently released, and returned to [[England]]. Marsden died in the summer of 1920, but prior to his death he had translated the appendix to Nilus's 1905 book on the coming of the [[Anti-Christ]], a copy of which was at hand in the [[British Museum]]. 

In a single year 1920, five editions sold out in England. That same year in the [[United States of America|United States]], [[Henry Ford]] sponsored the printing of 500,000 copies, and from 1920 to   1922 published a series of antisemitic articles, entitled the '''[[International Jew]], The World's Foremost Problem''', in ''[[The Dearborn Independent]]'', a newspaper he owned. In 1921 Ford cited it as evidence of a Jewish threat: "The only statement I care to make about the ''Protocols'' is that they fit in with what is going on. They are sixteen years old, and they have fitted the world situation up to this time."<ref name=Wallace2003>Max Wallace, ''The American Axis'' St. Martin's Press, 2003</ref> In 1927, however, Ford retracted his publication and apologized, claiming his assistants duped him. However, he later expressed his admiration for [[Nazi Germany]].<ref name=Dobbs1998>''[http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/national/daily/nov98/nazicars30.htm Ford and GM Scrutinized for Alleged Nazi Collaboration]'' by Michael Dobbs.

"'''The Protocols'''" (On Spine); '''1934'''; '''THE PATRIOTIC PUBLISHING CO.'''; ''P.O. Box 526; Chicago, Ill.''</gallery>

In [[1934]], an anonymous editor expanded the compilation with "Text and Commentary" (pages 136-141). The production of this uncredited compilation was a 300-page book, a inauthentic expanded edition of the twelfth chapter of Nilus's 1905 on the coming of the anti-Chirst. This 1934 imprint was published by a so-called "Patriotic Publishing Co." (an unincorporated entity that operated out of a [[post office box]]). An examination of this version reveals that it consists of substantial liftings of excerpts of articles from [[Henry Ford]]'s anti-Semitic periodicle (which Ford owned), the [[Dearborn Independent]]. This 1934 text circulates most widely in the English-speaking world, as well as on the Internet, or Web. It is often made available by [[Noontide Press]]. The last page of this (hardcopy) compilation, un-numbered page 300, is entitled, "INDEX," but it is really a Table of Contents. In addition, it is bound with three (3) staples. Both these things suggest that it was printed abroad, possible in [[Nazi]] [[Germany]]; though it is written in the English Language, it addresses issues of concern not only to [[United States|Americans]], but to he the [[United Kingdom|British]] and [[France|French]]. For example, "PART IV, THE SOVIETIZATION OF THE BRITISH EMPIRE AND THE UNITED STATES" begins with "CHAPTER I, FABIANISM," which is a British subject foreign to Americans; whereas "CHAPTEL LXXXIV, L'ALLIANCE ISRAELITE UNIVERSELLE," concerns France. Accordingly, aside from its post office box address, there is nothing that proves that this unincorporated entity is even [[American]]. In addition, it is to be noted that in [[1933]] the [[Nazis]] had already re-organized themselves in the [[United States]] as, and with the innocuous name, [[Friends of New Germany]].

[[Image:Protocols Brazil 1937.jpg|thumb|right|1937 [[Brazil]]ian edition of the Protocols]]
The "Text  and Commentary" concludes with a comment on [[Chaim Weizmann]]'s October 6, 1920 remark at a banquet: "A beneficent protection which God has instituted in the life of the Jew is that He has dispersed him all over the world." Marsden, who had been dead by then, is credited with the following assertion:
<blockquote>
"It proves that the Learned Elders exist. It proves that Dr. Weizmann knows all about them. It proves that the desire for a "National Home" in Palestine is only camouflage and an infinitesimal part of the Jew's real object. It proves that the Jews of the world have no intention of settling in Palestine or any separate country, and that their annual prayer that they may all meet "Next Year in Jerusalem" is merely a piece of their characteristic make-believe. It also demonstrates that the Jews are now a world menace, and that the Aryan races will have to domicile them permanently out of Europe."<ref name=Marsden>Introduction to English edition by Victor E. Marsden</ref>
</blockquote>

This quote occurs on page 138. On the previous page, the nameless commentator has the following: "There has been recently published a volume of [[Theodor Herzl|Herzl]]'s ''Diaries'', a translation of some passages of which appeared in the ''Jewish Chronicle'' of July 14, [[1922]]." 
Accordingly, the commentary must have been written at least two years after Marsden's death.

===German language publication===

The first [[German language|German]] translation was by Ludwig M<U+00FC>ller von Hausen in [[1920]]. It was followed in 1923 by [[Alfred Rosenberg]]'s edition, ''Die Protokolle der Weisen von Zion und die judische Weltpolitik''.

===''The Times'' exposes a forgery, 1921===
[[Image:19210816 TheTimes exposes TheProtocols as a forgery.jpg|thumb|100px|''[[The Times]]'' exposed the ''Protocols'' as a forgery on August 16-18, 1921]]
In 1920, the history of the concepts found in the ''Protocols'' was traced back to the works of Goedsche and Joly by [[Lucien Wolf]]; was published in [[London]] in August 1921; and was similarly exposed in the [http://emperors-clothes.com/antisem/times-pdf.htm series of articles] in ''[[The Times]]'' by its [[Constantinople]] reporter, [[Philip Graves]], who took his information from Wolf's work. 

<!-- Note! In 1921, the city ''was'' called Constantinople. It was not renamed back to Istanbul until 1930. So don't change the city name in this section! -->
According to writer Peter Grose, [[Allen Dulles]], who was in Constantinople developing relationships in post-[[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] political structures, discovered 'the source' of the documentation ultimately provided to ''The Times''. Grose writes that ''The Times'' extended a loan to the source, a Russian <U+00E9>migr<U+00E9> who refused to be identified, with the understanding the loan would not be repaid.<ref>Peter Grose, in ''Gentleman Spy: The Life of Allen Dulles'' (Houghton Mifflin 1994)</ref> Colin Holmes, a lecturer in economic history of [[Sheffield University]], identified the <U+00E9>migr<U+00E9> as Michael Raslovleff, a self-confessed antisemite, who gave the information to Graves so as not to "give a weapon of any kind to the Jews, whose friend I have never been."<ref>[[Leon Poliakov|Poliakov, Leon]] (1997). "Protocols of the Learned Elders of Zion". ''[[Encyclopedia Judaica]]'' (CD-ROM Edition Version 1.0). Ed. [[Cecil Roth]]. Keter Publishing House. ISBN 965-07-0665-8</ref>

In the first article of Graves' series, entitled "A Literary Forgery", the editors of ''The Times'' wrote, "our Constantinople Correspondent presents for the first time conclusive proof that the document is in the main a clumsy plagiarism.  He has forwarded us a copy of the French book from which the plagiarism is made."<ref name=GravesPDF>[http://emperor.vwh.net/antisem/first.pdf "Jewish World Plot": An Exposure.

Front page, Section 7</ref> In the same year, an entire book documenting the hoax was published in the United States by [[Herman Bernstein]]. Despite this widespread and extensive debunking, the ''Protocols'' continued to be regarded as important factual evidence by antisemites.

===The Bern Trial, 1934-1935===
In [[1934]], Dr. A. Zander, a [[Switzerland|Swiss]] follower of Nazism, published a series of articles accepting the ''Protocols'' as fact.  He was sued in what has come to be known as the Berne Trial. The trial began in the [[Cantons of Switzerland|Cantonal]] Court of [[Bern]] on [[October 29]], 1934, the plaintiffs were Dr. J. Dreyfus-Brodsky, Dr. Marcus Cohen and Dr. Marcus Ehrenpreis. On [[May 19]], [[1935]] the court, after full investigation, declared the ''Protocols'' to be forgeries, plagiarisms, and obscene literature. Judge Walter Meyer, a Christian who had not heard of the ''Protocols'' earlier, said in conclusion: 
<blockquote>
"I hope, the time will come when nobody will be able to understand how in [[1935]] nearly a dozen sane and responsible men were able for two weeks to mock the intellect of the Bern court discussing the authenticity of the so-called Protocols, the very Protocols that, harmful as they have been and will be, are nothing but laughable nonsense".<ref name=Kadzhaya/>
</blockquote>

A Russian emigre, anti-Bolshevik and [[Anti-fascism|anti-Fascist]] [[Vladimir Burtsev]], who exposed numerous Okhranka [[agent provocateur|agents provocateurs]] in the early 1900s, served as a witness at the Berne Trial. In 1938 in Paris he published a book, ''The Protocols of the Elders of Zion: A Proved Forgery'', based on his testimony.

On November 1, 1937 the sued party of the trial applied to the Swiss Court of Appeal asking to reverse the verdict, claiming that the law, while prohibiting "obscene literature", means pornography and is inapplicable to the "Protocols". The three judges focused on purely procedural aspects of the case and decided to reverse the verdict. However, the presiding judge stated clearly that the forgery of the Protocols is not questionable and expressed regret that the law does not provide enough protection for Jews from literature of that kind. The court put the costs of both trials upon the sued party.<ref>Hadassa Ben-Itto, ''The Lie That Wouldn<U+2019>t Die: The Protocols of the Elders of Zion'', Chapter 11.</ref> This decision gave grounds for later allegations that the appeal court "confirmed authenticity of the Protocols" which is opposite to the facts.

===South Africa===

In an August 1934 case in [[Grahamstown]], [[South Africa]], the court imposed fines totalling [[South African pound|<U+00A3>]]1,775 (about $8,875 at the time or about $130,000 in 2005 dollars) on three men for disseminating a version of the ''Protocols''.

===The Protocols in Nazi propaganda, 1930s-1940s===
[[Image:Protocols of the Elders of Zion 1943 Poland Poznan.gif|thumb|170px|1943 [[Polish language]] edition, published in [[General Government|Poland under Nazi occupation]], shows a typical antisemitic caricature]]
The ''Protocols'' also became a part of the [[Nazism|Nazi]] propaganda effort to justify persecution of the Jews. It was made required reading for German students. In ''[[The Holocaust]]: The Destruction of European Jewry 1933-1945'', [[Nora Levin]] states that "[[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]] used the ''Protocols'' as a manual in his war to exterminate the Jews": 
<blockquote>
Despite conclusive proof that the ''Protocols'' were a gross forgery, they had sensational popularity and large sales in the 1920s and 1930s. They were translated into every language of Europe and sold widely in Arab lands, the United States, and England. But it was in Germany after [[World War I]] that they had their greatest success. There they were used to explain all of the disasters that had befallen the country: the defeat in the war, the hunger, the destructive inflation.<ref name=Levin>Nora Levin, ''The Holocaust: The Destruction of European Jewry 1933-1945''. Quoting from [http://ddickerson.igc.org/hitler-protokollen.html]</ref>
</blockquote>

Hitler refers to the ''Protocols'' in ''[[Mein Kampf]]'':
<blockquote>
... To what extent the whole existence of this people is based on a continuous lie is shown incomparably by the ''Protocols of the Wise Men of Zion'', so infinitely hated by the Jews. They are based on a forgery, the ''[[Frankfurter Zeitung]]'' moans and screams once every week: the best proof that they are authentic. [...] the important thing is that with positively terrifying certainty they reveal the nature and activity of the Jewish people and expose their inner contexts as well as their ultimate final aims.<ref name=Hitler1924>Adolf Hitler, ''[[Mein Kampf]]'': Chapter XI: Nation and Race, Vol I, pp. 307-308.</ref>
</blockquote>

====Fascist Italy====

In the wake of the growing alliance between Hitler's Germany and [[Fascist]] Italy, the ''Protocols'' were published in [[Italy]] in 1937, with an introduction by [[Julius Evola]].

==Contemporary usage and popularity==
While there is continued popularity of ''The Protocols'' in nations from [[South America]] to [[Asia]], since the defeat of [[Nazi Germany]] and fascist [[Italy]] in the Second World War governments or political leaders in most parts of the world have generally avoided claims that ''The Protocols'' represent factual evidence of a real Jewish conspiracy. The exception to this is the [[Middle East]], where a large number of [[Arab]] and [[Muslim]] regimes and leaders have endorsed them as authentic. 

Past endorsements of ''The Protocols'' from Presidents [[Gamal Abdel Nasser]] and [[Anwar Sadat]] of [[Egypt]], one of the President Arifs of [[Iraq]], King [[Faisal of Saudi Arabia|Faisal]] of [[Saudi Arabia]], and Colonel [[Muammar al-Gaddafi]] of [[Libya]], among other political and intellectual leaders of the Arab world, are echoed by 21st century endorsements from the [[Grand Mufti]] of [[Jerusalem]] Sheikh [[Ekrima Sa'id Sabri]] and [[Hamas]] to the education ministry of [[Saudi Arabia]].<ref name=ADL-IASHP>[http://www.adl.org/anti_semitism/arab/Arab_Anti-Semitism.pdf Islamic Antisemitism in Historical Perspective] (PDF) at [[Anti-Defamation League]]</ref>

===Middle East===
As [[Arab-Israeli conflict|popular opposition to Israel]] spread across the Middle East in the second half of the century, many [[Arab]] governments funded new printings of the ''Protocols'', and taught them in their schools as historical fact. They have been accepted as such by many [[Islamism|Islamist]] organizations, such as [[Hamas]] and [[Islamic Jihad]]. Reportedly, Arabic editions issued in the Middle East were found on sale as far away as [[London]].<ref name=ITC-Exporting>[http://www.intelligence.org.il/eng/eng_n/pro_10_05_e.htm Exporting Arabic antisemitic publications issued in the Middle East to Britain] Intelligence and Terrorism Information Center at the Center for Special Studies (ITC CSS).

====Egypt====
In a foreword to a translation of [[Shimon Peres]]' book ''The New Middle East'', the [[Egypt]]ian state-owned publisher [[al-Ahram]] editorialized in 1995:
<blockquote>
When ''The Protocols of the Elders of Zion'' were discovered, some 200 years ago, and translated in various languages, including Arabic, the [[World Zionist Organization]] attempted to deny the existence of the plot, and claimed forgery. The Zionists even endeavoured to purchase all the existing copies, in order to prevent their circulation. But today, [[Shimon Peres]] proves unequivocally that the ''Protocols'' are authentic, and that they tell the truth.

An article in the Egyptian state-owned newspaper ''al-Akhbar'' on [[February 3]], 2002 stated:
<blockquote>
All the evils that currently affect the world are the doings of Zionism. This is not surprising, because the ''Protocols of the Elders of Zion'', which were established by their wise men more than a century ago, are proceeding according to a meticulous and precise plan and time schedule, and they are proof that even though they are a minority, their goal is to rule the world and the entire human race."

In October 2002, a private Egyptian television company Dream TV produced a 41-part "historical drama" ''A Horseman Without a Horse'' (''Fares Bela Gewad''), largely based on the ''Protocols'',<ref name=ADL-Plot>[http://www.adl.org/special_reports/protocols/protocols_plot2.asp Plot summary] at the [[Anti-Defamation League]]</ref> which ran on 17 [[Arabic language|Arabic-language]] [[satellite television]] channels, including government-owned Egypt Television (ETV), for a month, causing concerns in the West.<ref name=USSD2002>[http://www.state.gov/r/pa/prs/ps/2002/14834.htm Egypt: U.S. Concerns Regarding Proposed Antisemitic Mini-Series] Office of the Spokesman at the U.S. State Department</ref> Egypt's Information Minister Safwat El-Sherif announced that the series "contains no antisemitic material".<ref name=Ahram2002>[http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/2002/611/eg7.htm Protocols, politics and Palestine] at ''al-Ahram Weekly''</ref>

On November 17, 2003, an Egyptian weekly ''al-Usbu<U+2018>'' reported that the manuscript museum at the [[Bibliotheca Alexandrina|Alexandria Library]], displayed the first Arabic translation of the ''Protocols'' at the section of the holy books of Judaism, next to a Torah scroll. The museum's director Dr. Yousef Ziedan was quoted as saying in an interview:
<blockquote>
"...it has become one of the sacred [texts] of the Jews, next to their first constitution, their religious law ... more important to the Zionist Jews of the world than the Torah, because they conduct Zionist life according to it ... It is only natural to place the book in the framework of an exhibit of Torah."<ref name=Usbu>[http://www.memri.org/bin/articles.cgi?Page=countries&Area=egypt&ID=SP61903 Jewish Holy Books On Display at the Alexandria Library: The Torah & the 'Protocols of the Elders of Zion'] December 3, 2003</ref>
</blockquote>
It also quoted him as saying that no more than one million Jews were killed by the Nazis, but Zionists manipulated the "knowledge that has reached the world".<ref name=Usbu/>  See also:- [[Holocaust denial]].

Dr. Yousef Ziedan strongly denies these quotes, accusing ''al-Usbu<U+2018>'' of attributing "fabricated, groundless lies" to him and stating that "the Protocols is a racist, silly, fabricated book":

: "The story began with an article in an Egyptian newspaper, ''al-Usbu<U+2018>'', two weeks ago (on November 17th, 2003), which alleged quoting from me utterly senseless statements intertwining facts with fancies. A month before, a journalist from the aforementioned newspaper interviewed me concerning the recent refurbishment of the manuscript and rare book museum. I handed her a written statement, as was the case with other journalists who covered the same news. Although, she concluded her article with my exact words, she started it with fabricated, groundless lies. She falsely reported me saying that I placed an edition of the Protocols of the Elders of Zion at the center of the museum alongside the Jewish Torah and divine books. Moreover, she claimed that I told her that this book is more significant then the Torah... On my part, I would like to maintain to the visitors of ziedan.com that the Protocols is a racist, silly, fabricated book. Perhaps, I should consider more thoroughly the Jewish issue on the academic level and furnish my vision of the interaction of religions.

After the publication, director of the Library Dr. Ismail Serageldin issued a statement:
<blockquote>
"Preliminary investigation determined that the book was briefly displayed in a showcase devoted to rotating samples of curiosities and unusual items in our collection. ... The book is a well-known 19th century fabrication to foment anti-Jewish feelings.

====Iran====
The first [[Iran]]ian edition of the ''Protocols'' was issued during the summer of 1978 before the [[Iranian Revolution]]. In 1985 a new edition of the ''Protocols'' was printed and widely distributed by the [[Islamic Propagation Organization]], International Relations Department in [[Tehran]]. The [[Astaneh-ye Qods Razavi]] ([[Shrine of Imam Reza]]) Foundation in [[Mashhad, Iran]], one of the wealthiest institutions in [[Iran]], financed publication of the ''Protocols'' in 1994. Parts of the ''Protocols'' were published by the daily [[Jomhouri-ye Eslami]] in 1994, under the heading ''The Smell of Blood, Zionist Schemes''. [[Sobh]], a [[radical Islam]]ic monthly, published excerpts from the ''Protocols'' under the heading ''The text of the Protocols of the Elders of Zion for establishing the Jewish global rule'' in its December 1998<U+2013>January 1999 issue, illustrated with a caricature of the Jewish snake swallowing the globe. 

Iranian writer and researcher [[Ali Baqeri]], who researched the ''Protocols'', finds their plan for [[world domination]] to be merely part of an even more grandiose scheme, saying in Sobh in 1999:
:"The ultimate goal of the Jews... after conquering the globe... is to extract from the hands of the Lord many stars and galaxies".

In April 2004, the Iranian television station Al-Alam broadcast ''Al-Sameri wa Al-Saher'', a series that reported as fact several conspiracy theories about [[the Holocaust]], Jewish control of [[Hollywood, Los Angeles, California|Hollywood]], and the ''Protocols''.<ref name=IranTV2004>[http://memri.org/bin/articles.cgi?Page=archives&Area=sd&ID=SP70504 Iranian TV Series Based on the Protocols of the Elders of Zion and the Jewish Control of Hollywood].

====Saudi Arabia====
[[Saudi Arabia]]n schoolbooks contain explicit summaries of the Protocols as factual:
<blockquote>
''The Protocols of the Elders of Zion'':
These are secret resolutions, most probably of the aforementioned Basel congress. They were discovered in the nineteenth century. The Jews tried to deny them, but there was ample evidence proving their authenticity and that they were issued by the elders of Zion. The Protocols can be summarized in the following points:
#Upsetting the foundations of the world's present society and its systems, in order to enable Zionism to have a monopoly of world government.
#Eliminating nationalities and religions, especially the Christian nations.
#Striving to increase corruption among the present regimes in Europe, as Zionism believes in their corruption and [eventual] collapse.
#Controlling the media of publication, propaganda and the press, using gold for stirring up disturbances, seducing people by means of lust and spreading wantonness.
The cogent proof of the authenticity of these resolutions, as well as of the hellish Jewish schemes included therein, is the [actual] carrying out of many of those schemes, intrigues and conspiracies that are found in them. Anyone who reads them <U+2014> and they were published in the nineteenth century <U+2014> grasps today to what extent much of what is found there has been realized.<ref name=CMIP-KSA2001>[http://www.edume.org/reports/10/38.htm CMIP report: The Jews in World History according to the Saudi textbooks].

According to [[Freedom House]] 2006 report, Saudi "textbook for boys for Tenth Grade on Hadith and Islamic Culture contains a lesson on the "Zionist Movement." It is a curious blend of wild conspiracy theories about Masonic Lodges, [[Rotary International|Rotary Clubs]], and [[Lions Clubs International|Lions Clubs]] with antisemitic invective.

====Hamas====
The Charter of [[Hamas]] explicitly refers to the ''Protocols,'' accepting them as factual and makes several references to Freemasons as one of the "secret societies" controlled by "Zionists." The Article 32 of the ''[[wikisource:Hamas Covenant|Hamas Charter]]'' states:
:The Zionist plan is limitless. After Palestine, the Zionists aspire to expand from the [[Nile]] to the [[Euphrates]]. When they will have digested the region they overtook, they will aspire to further expansion, and so on. Their plan is embodied in the ''"Protocols of the Elders of Zion"'', and their present conduct is the best proof of what we are saying.<ref name=HAMAS-charter>[http://www.yale.edu/lawweb/avalon/mideast/hamas.htm The Covenant of the Islamic Resistance Movement (HAMAS)] [[August 18]], [[1988]] (The Avalon Project at [[Yale Law School]]) retrieved October 2005</ref>

====Palestinian National Authority====
The [[Palestinian National Authority|PNA]] frequently used the ''Protocols'' in the media and education under their control and some Palestinian academics presented the forgery as a plot upon which Zionism is based. For example, on [[January 25]], 2001, the official PNA daily ''[[Al-Hayat al-Jadida]]'' cited the ''Protocols'' on its ''Political National Education'' page to explain Israel's policies:
<blockquote>
Disinformation has been one of the bases of morale and psychological manipulation among the Israelis ... The ''Protocols of the Elders of Zion'' did not ignore the importance of using propaganda to promote the Zionist goals. The second protocol reads: 'Through the newspapers we will have the means to propel and to influence'. In the twelfth protocol: 'Our governments will hold the reins of most of the newspapers, and through this plan we will possess the primary power to turn to public opinion.'
</blockquote>
Later that year the same newspaper wrote: "The purpose of the military policy is to impose this situation on the residents and force them to leave their homes, and this is done in the framework of the ''Protocols of Zion''..."<ref name=Marcus2002>[http://www.pmw.org.il/Protocols.htm "The Protocols of the Elders of Zion" in official PA ideology, 2001-2002] a Bulletin by Itamar Marcus at Palestinian Media Watch.

The [[Grand Mufti]] of [[Jerusalem]] [[Sheikh Ekrima Sa'id Sabri]] appeared on the Saudi satellite channel [[Al-Majd]] on [[February 20]], [[2005]], commenting on the assassination of the former [[Lebanon|Lebanese]] Prime Minister [[Rafik Hariri]]. "Anyone who studies ''The Protocols of the Elders of Zion'' and specifically the [[Talmud]]," he said, "will discover that one of the goals of these Protocols is to cause confusion in the world and to undermine security throughout the world."<ref name=Boggan2005>[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/printFriendly/0,,1-7-1506190,00.html ''The anti-Jewish lie that refuses to die''] by Steve Boggan, ''The Times'', March 02, 2005</ref>

In 2005, it was reported that the Palestinian Authority was teaching the ''Protocols'' in schools. After media exposure, the PA promised to stop.<ref name=JVL-PA2005>[http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Peace/patext2.html Palestinian Authority Promises to Remove Protocols References from Textbooks].

On [[May 19]], 2005, the ''[[New York Times]]'' reported that Palestinian Authority Minister of Information [[Nabil Shaath]] removed from his ministry's web site an Arabic translation of the ''Protocols of the Elders of Zion.''<ref name=NYT2005>[http://www.nytimes.com/2005/05/19/international/middleeast/19protocols.html?

===Other contemporary appearances===
To a great degree, the text is still accepted as truthful in large parts of [[South America]] and [[Asia]], especially in [[Japan]] where variations on the ''Protocols'' have frequently made the bestseller lists.<ref name=PSAS>Antisemitism Worldwide 1995-6 (Project for the Study of Antisemitism, Tel Aviv University), pp. 265-6.<br/>

The text is mostly seen as an authentic document in [[Turkey]], particularly by [[nationalist]] and [[Islamist]] circles. ''Protocols'' were first issued in the magazine ''Mill<U+00EE> <U+0130>nk<U+0131>l<U+00E2>b'' (National Revolution) in 1934 and triggered the Thracian pogroms (''Trakya Olaylar<U+0131>'') the same year. It had made over one hundred editions from 1943 to 2004 and remains highly popular as a best-seller of all times.<ref name=H<U+00FC>r2005>''Kavgam ve Siyon Protokolleri'', Ay<U+015F>e H<U+00FC>r, Radikal 2, 13.03.2005<br/>

In February 2003, an [[Australia]]n [[new age]] publication ''Hard Evidence'' presented the ''Protocols'' as factual and that Jews were responsible for [[2002 Bali bombing]].<ref name=Jones2004>[http://www.jcpa.org/phas/phas-jones-f04.htm Confronting Reality: Antisemitism in Australia Today] by Jeremy Jones. Fall 2004</ref>

The [[New Zealand National Front]] sells copies published by their former national secretary, [[Kerry Bolton]]. Bolton also publishes (and the NZNF sells) a book entitled "The Protocols of Zion in Context<U+201D> that seeks to refute the idea that the ''Protocols'' are a forgery.

[[Idi Amin]], the President of [[Uganda]] from 1971 to 1979, cited the book as evidence of a Jewish conspiracy to take over the world, and as justification for his self-proclaimed plans to destroy [[Israel]]. He reveals this in an interview during the 1974 documentary [[Idi Amin Dada (1974 film)|Idi Amin Dada]], during which he also invited [[Palestinian]] rebels to his country, partially causing the [[Entebbe]] affair.

====United States====
The ''Protocols'' have had a tumultuous history in the [[United States of America|United States]] ever since luminaries such as automobile mogul [[Henry Ford]] began publishing them under the title of ''The International Jew''.  The ''Protocols'' were republished as fact in 1991 in [[Milton William Cooper]]'s conspiracy diatribe ''[[Behold a Pale Horse]]'', though Cooper himself holds the [[Illuminati]] and not the Jews at fault.

''The Plot'', the final graphic novel by famed writer/artist [[Will Eisner]], was about the history of the Protocols.

The [[United States|American]] [[Chain store|retail chain]], [[Wal-Mart]], was criticized for selling ''The Protocols of the Elders of Zion'' on its [[website]] with a description that suggested it might be genuine. It was withdrawn from sale in September 2004, as 'a business decision'. It is distributed in the [[United States]] by some [[Palestinian]] student groups on [[college campus]]es, and by [[Louis Farrakhan]]'s [[Nation of Islam]].<ref name=Hertzberg1999>Arthur Hertzberg, ''Jews: The Essence and Character of a People'' Harper Collins, 1999. p 34.</ref>

In 2002, the [[Paterson, New Jersey|Paterson]], [[New Jersey]]-based Arabic-language newspaper ''[[The Arab Voice]]'' published excerpts from the ''Protocols'' as true.<ref name=Pipes2002>[http://www.danielpipes.org/article/499 The Paterson 'Protocols'] by [[Daniel Pipes]]. ''[[New York Post]]''. November 5, 2002</ref>
The paper's editor and publisher [[Walid Rabah]] defended himself from criticism with the protestation that "some major writers in the Arab nation accept the truth of the book."<ref name=Documentary2005>A documentary film, ''Protocols of Zion'' (2005)[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0436686/], connects the ''Protocols'' to a resurgence of antisemitism following the [[September 11]] [[World Trade Center]] attacks.</ref>

During his October 2003 presentation at the [[College of Wooster]] in [[Wooster, Ohio]], Samir Makhlouf of the [[Presbyterian Peacemakers]] organization stated that the ''Protocols'' was a factual text that explains how [[Zionist]]s have been taking over the world's [[politics]], [[economics]] and [[communications]]. After the controversy became public, the group's sponsors "agreed that they had made a grave mistake, and ... that antisemitism is anti-Christianity."<ref name=Wooster2004-02>[http://www.clevelandjewishnews.com/articles/2004/02/05/news/local/bhate0206.txt Message of hate brought to Wooster campus]</ref><ref name=Wooster2004-04>[http://www.clevelandjewishnews.com/articles/2004/04/28/news/local/college0430.txt College of Wooster begins bridge building] published in ''Cleveland Jewish News'' (retrieved Feb. 19, 2006)</ref>

====Soviet Union and post-Soviet states====
====The Soviet Union====
[[Howard Sachar]] describes the allegations of global Jewish conspiracy resurrected during the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] "anti-Zionist" campaign in the wake of the [[Six-Day War]]:
<blockquote>"In late July 1967, Moscow launched an unprecedented [[Zionology|propaganda campaign against Zionism]] as a "world threat." Defeat was attributed not to tiny Israel alone, but to an "all-powerful international force." ... In its flagrant vulgarity, the new propaganda assault soon achieved Nazi-era characteristics. The Soviet public was saturated with racist canards. Extracts from Trofim Kichko's notorious 1963 volume, ''[[:Image:Iudaism bez prikras 63-7.gif|Judaism Without Embellishment]]'', were extensively republished in the Soviet media. Yuri Ivanov's ''Beware: Zionism'', a book essentially replicated ''The Protocols of the Elders of Zion'', was given nationwide coverage."<ref name=Sachar2005>[[Howard Sachar]], ''A History of the Jews in the Modern World'' (Knopf, NY. 2005) p.722</ref>
</blockquote>

A similar picture is drawn by [[Paul Johnson (journalist)|Paul Johnson]]: the [[mass media]] "all over the Soviet Union portrayed the Zionists (i.e. Jews) and Israeli leaders as engaged in a world-wide conspiracy along the lines of the old ''Protocols of Zion''. It was, ''Sovietskaya Latvia'' wrote 5 August 1967, an 'international [[Cosa Nostra]] with a common centre, common programme and common funds'".<ref name=Johnson1987>[[Paul Johnson (journalist)|Paul Johnson]], ''A History of the Jews'' (1987) p.575-576</ref>
====The Russian Federation====
Despite stipulations against fomenting hatred based on ethnic or religious grounds (Article 282 of [[Russia]] [[Penal Code]]), the ''Protocols'' have enjoyed numerous reprints in the nationalist press after the [[collapse of the Soviet Union]].  In 1993, a district court in [[Moscow]], [[Russia]], formally ruled that the ''Protocols'' were faked in dismissing a [[libel]] suit by the [[ultra-nationalist]] [[Pamyat]] organization, which had been criticized for using them in their antisemitic publications.<ref name=Hiltzik1993>[http://www.nizkor.org/ftp.cgi?documents/protocols/protocols.001 Russian Court Rules 'Protocols' an Antisemitic Forgery] By Michael A. Hiltzik, ''Los Angeles Times'', November 28, 1993 (Retrieved Sept 2005)</ref> 
In 2003, one century after the first publication of the ''Protocols'', an article<ref name=AiF2003>''[http://www.aif.ru/online/aif/1194/12_02 Protocols of contention]'', ''[[Argumenty i fakty]]'', September 10, 2003</ref> in the most popular Russian weekly ''[[Argumenty i fakty]]'' referred to it as a "peculiar bible of Zionism" and showed a photo of the First Zionist Congress of 1897. The co-president of the [[National-Patriot Union of Russia]] [[Alexander Prokhanov]] wrote: "It does not matter whether the ''Protocols'' are a forgery or a factual conspiracy document." The article also contained refutation of the allegations by the president of the Russian Jewish congress Yevgeny Satanovsky.

As recently as 2005, the ''Protocols'' was "a frequent feature in [[Russian Orthodox Church|Patriarchate churches]]".<ref name=Goble2005>[http://www.washtimes.com/upi-breaking/20050412-023331-8874r.htm Eye on Eurasia: Believing the ''Protocols''] By Paul Goble [[UPI]], April 13, 2005</ref><ref name=Gidwitz2003>[http://www.jcpa.org/phas/phas-7.htm Antisemitism in the Post-Soviet States] by Betsy Gidwitz.
