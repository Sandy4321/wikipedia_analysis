The '''Omaha and Council Bluffs Railway and Bridge Company''', known as '''O&CB''', was incorporated in 1886 in order to connect [[Omaha, Nebraska]] with [[Council Bluffs, Iowa]] over the [[Missouri River]]. It was among the earliest major electric street railway systems in the nation, and was one of the last streetcar operators in the U.S., making their last run in 1955.<ref>Mead & Hunt, In.

==About==
The O&CB's railway ran over the [[Douglas Street Bridge]] from its inception.<ref>[http://www.omahapubliclibrary.org/earlyomaha/bridges/douglasbridge.html "Ak-Sar-Ben Bridge"], Omaha Public Library. Retrieved 4/10/08.</ref> By 1902 all of the electric-powered railways in Omaha were consolidated in the O&CB. In 1943 the company began training women as streetcar operators after many of its male drivers were called into military service during WW II. The women learned quickly and were paid the same wages as their male counterparts.<ref>[http://www.omahahistory.org/History%20at%20a%20Glance%209-2007.pdf Omaha History: At a Glance.] Douglas County Historical Society.

The still-standing Omaha and Council Bluffs Street Railway Company Car Barn at the intersection of South 10th Street and Pierce Street housed [[streetcar]]s and was the last active barn in the city. The O&CB line ceased operating on [[March 4]], [[1955]].<ref>Omaha City Planning Department. (1980) ''A Comprehensive Program for Historic Preservation in Omaha.
