'''Ezola Broussard Foster''' (born August 9, 1938) is an [[United States|American]] activist, writer, and politician. She is president of ''Black Americans for Family Values'', authored the book ''What's Right for All Americans'', and was the [[Reform Party of the United States of America|Reform Party]] candidate for [[Vice President of the United States|Vice President]] in the [[U.S. presidential election, 2000|U.S. presidential election of 2000]]. In April 2002, Foster left the Reform Party to join the [[United States Constitution Party|Constitution Party]].

== Career and political activism ==
Foster was born and raised in [[Louisiana]] and earned a master's degree from [[Texas Southern University]]. <!-- 1973 grad. seems to be incorrect--> In 1960, she moved to [[Los Angeles]], where she was a public [[high school]] teacher for 33 years - teaching typing, business courses and sometimes English classes.

She had sought public office prior to 2000 - as a [[United States Democratic Party|Democrat]] in the 1970s and as a [[United States Republican Party|Republican]] candidate for [[California State Assembly]] in 1984. In the 1980s, she became an outspoken opponent of [[pornography]], the [[civil rights movement]], [[sex education]], [[AIDS]] education and [[gay rights]] and founded "Black Americans for Family Values." She was arrested in 1987 with several other women while disrupting the state Republican convention to protest its recognition of the [[Log Cabin Republicans|Log Cabin Club]], an organization of [[gay Republican]]s. In 1992, she was a staunch defender of the police officers in the [[Rodney King]] beating case and organized a testimonial dinner for [[Laurence Powell]], one of the convicted officers, in 1995.

In 1994, while teaching at [[Bell High School (Bell, California)|Bell High School]] in [[Bell, California|Bell]], California, Foster was a public advocate of [[California Proposition 187 (1994)|Proposition 187]], a [[California]] ballot initiative to deny government programs of [[social services]], [[health care]], and [[public education]] to illegal immigrants. Her position was extremely unpopular at the school where she taught, which was 90 percent [[Hispanic]]. In 1996, after she argued on [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]]'s ''[[The NewsHour with Jim Lehrer|MacNeil/Lehrer NewsHour]]'' that illegal immigration was responsible for the low quality of Los Angeles schools, some of her colleagues at the school condemned her in an open letter. Two days later, she attended an anti-illegal-immigration rally where several of her supporters were attacked by members of the [[Progressive Labor Party (USA)|Progressive Labor Party]], who allegedly wanted to harm Foster herself. Shortly thereafter, she left her job, which she calls a necessity resulting from her treatment at work. She went on speaking tours for the [[John Birch Society]] and took workers' compensation for an undisclosed mental disorder <U+2014> which she describes as "stress" and "anxiety" <U+2014> until her official [[retirement]] as a teacher in 1998.

Foster has appeared on [[The Political Cesspool]], a [[white nationalist]] radio talk show based in Memphis, Tennessee. She has also been a guest on ''[[Larry King Live]]'', ''[[CBS This Morning]]'', ''CNN & CO.'', ''[[Nightline (US news program)|Nightline]], NewsTalk Television'', ''[[CNN Live Today|CNN Live]]'', [[MSNBC]], ''[[Politically Incorrect]]'', and various [[CBS]], [[NBC]], and [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] newscasts.<ref>"[http://digital.library.ucla.edu/websites/2001_998_001/WhoIsEzola.htm WHO IS EZOLA?]" Ezola Foster for Congress. 2001. Digital Collections - [[UCLA]] Library. Accessed February 9, 2009.</ref>

== Election of 2000 ==
[[Pat Buchanan]] selected Foster as his running-mate after several other candidates such as [[Jim Traficant]] and [[James P. Hoffa]] declined his offer. Foster, who had supported Buchanan's campaigns in 1992 and 1996, quit her speaking tour to join the race. While Buchanan was hospitalized during part of the campaign, Foster was the ticket's mouthpiece, campaigning through television and radio appearances. This was the first time in history that an African-American had been nominated for Vice-President by an [[Federal Election Commission]]-recognized and federally-funding political party, and the second time a woman had accomplished this (Democrat [[Geraldine Ferraro]] being the first).

== Personal life ==
Foster is [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]]. Her first marriage, by which she has a son, ended in [[annulment]], she says, when she found out that her husband was a convicted [[felony|felon]]. Later, in 1977, she married Chuck Foster, a truck driver. They have two adult children. Foster is a grandmother. She lives in Los Angeles.
