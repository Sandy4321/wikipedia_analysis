{{Nihongo|"'''Ashita, Haru ga Kitara'''"|<U+660E><U+65E5><U+3001><U+6625><U+304C><U+6765><U+305F><U+3089>||"Tomorrow, If Spring Comes"}} is a song by Japanese entertainer [[Takako Matsu]] from her debut album, ''[[Sora no Kagami]]'' (1997). It was released on March 21, 1997, through [[Bertelsmann Music Group|BMG Japan]] as her debut [[single (music)|single]]. The song was written by Y<U+016B>ji Sakamoto and Daisuke Hinata, while Hinata produced the song. Following the wrap-up of the drama ''[[Long Vacation]]'', she decided to give singing a try upon the suggestion of one of its directors.

The track was recorded in [[Santa Monica, California]], and is a mid-tempo [[J-pop]] song composed in the [[Key (music)|key]] of [[B minor]]. Its lyrics recite a young girl's memories of her love for a boy in her high school days. It has been praised by critics and associated with the onset of spring in Japan, having re-entered the airplay charts in Japan around that time, even years after its initial release. It has also been covered by many other artists like [[Namie Amuro]], [[Masaharu Fukuyama]], and [[Ayumi Shibata]]. The single peaked at number 8 on the [[Oricon]] singles chart and spent 20 weeks in the top 20 of the chart. It was certified platinum by the [[Recording Industry Association of Japan]] (RIAJ) for shipments exceeding 400,000 copies.<ref name="RIAJ-jul1997"/>

Ten years after its initial release, Matsu released a new version of the song titled "Ashita, Haru ga Kitara 97<U+2013>07" in March 2007. The re-release contains updated lyrics reflecting changes in the artist's mind. By intermixing her vocals with her vocals from 10 years before, new version contrasts the two. The new version was featured on her album ''Cherish You'' (2007) and also on her compilation album ''Footsteps: 10th Anniversary Complete Best'' (2008). As of 2014, Matsu has performed the song on all of her concert tours as well as other events, including [[NHK]]'s ''[[K<U+014D>haku Uta Gassen]]'' in 1997.
