'''Little Stirrup Cay''', [[Bahamas]], is one of the [[Berry Islands]], a collection of cays and small islands.  It is less than a mile (around one kilometer) wide from east to west and less than a 200 yards (meters) from north to south. The east end is the center of recreational activities with beaches fronting a [[coral]] basin where [[manatee]], [[Batoidea|rays]], and numerous [[fish]] can be seen. There is an rocky inlet on the north side of the island large enough for the [[Ship's tender|tenders]] operate from. Nature trails run the entire length and width of the island.

[[Royal Caribbean|Royal Caribbean Cruise Line]] leases the island for their exclusive use and calls it "Coco Cay". Royal Caribbean cruise ships frequently stop at the island and bring visitors over by tender.  Activities available to guests include [[swimming]], [[snorkeling]], [[kayaking]], [[parasailing]], [[scuba]] diving, and [[Waverunner]] piloting. A complimentary [[barbecue]] lunch is offered. And the island's specialty drink, the "Coco-Loco", is available with or without [[rum]] for a reasonable charge.
