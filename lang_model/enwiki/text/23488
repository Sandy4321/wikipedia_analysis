A '''transformer''' is an electrical device that transfers energy between two or more circuits through [[electromagnetic induction]].

A&nbsp;varying current in the transformer's primary winding creates a varying [[magnetic flux]] in the core and a varying magnetic field impinging on the secondary winding. This varying [[magnetic field]] at the secondary induces a varying [[electromotive force]] (emf) or voltage in the secondary winding. Making use of [[Faraday's Law]] in conjunction with high [[permeability (electromagnetism)|magnetic permeability]] core properties, transformers can thus be designed to efficiently change [[alternating current|AC]] voltages from one voltage level to another within power networks.

Transformers range in size from [[RF]] transformers a small cm<sup>3</sup> fraction in volume to units interconnecting the [[power grid]] weighing hundreds of tons. A&nbsp;wide range of transformer designs are used in electronic and electric power applications. Since the invention in 1885 of the first constant [[potential energy|potential]] transformer, transformers have become essential for the AC [[transmission line|transmission]], [[electric power distribution|distribution]], and utilization of electrical energy.<ref name="Bedell (1942)">{{cite journal|last1=Bedell|first1=Frederick|title=History of A-C Wave Form, Its Determination and Standardization|journal=Transactions of the American Institute of Electrical Engineers|volume=61|issue=12|page=p. 864|doi=10.1109/T-AIEE.1942.5058456}}</ref>

It is very common, for simplification or approximation purposes, to analyze the transformer as an ideal transformer model as represented in the two images. An ideal transformer is a theoretical, [[Linearity|linear]] transformer that is lossless and perfectly [[magnetic coupling|coupled]]; that is, there are no [[Transformer#Energy Losses|energy losses]] and [[flux]] is completely confined within the [[magnetic core]]. Perfect coupling implies infinitely high core [[Permeability (electromagnetism)|magnetic permeability]] and winding inductances and zero net [[magnetomotive force]].<ref name="Brenner p598">Brenner, pp. 598<U+2013>600</ref>{{efn|This also implies the following: Input impedance is infinite when secondary is open and zero when secondary is shorted; there is zero phase-shift through an ideal transformer; input and output power and reactive volt-ampere are each conserved; these three statements apply for any frequency above zero and periodic waveforms are conserved.<ref name="Crosby (1958)">{{cite journal|last1=Crosby|first1=D.|title=The Ideal Transformer|journal=IRE Transactions on Circuit Theory|date=1958|volume=5|issue=2|pages=145<U+2013>145|doi=10.1109/TCT.1958.1086447|accessdate=21 June 2014}}</ref>}}

A&nbsp;varying current in the transformer's primary winding creates a varying magnetic flux in the core and a varying magnetic field impinging on the secondary winding. This varying magnetic field at the secondary induces a varying electromotive force (emf) or voltage in the secondary winding. The primary and secondary windings are wrapped around a core of infinitely high magnetic permeability{{efn|Windings of real transformers are usually wound around very high permeability [[Magnetic core|ferromagnetic cores]] but can also be [[Transformer#Cores|air-core]] wound.}} so that all of the magnetic flux passes through both the primary and secondary windings.  With [[voltage source]] connected to the primary winding and load [[electrical impedance |impedance]] connected to the secondary winding, the transformer currents flow in the indicated directions. (See also [[transformer#Polarity|Polarity]].)

====Polarity====
A [[dot convention]] is often used in transformer circuit diagrams, nameplates or terminal markings to define the relative polarity of transformer windings.

===Real transformer===
====Deviations from ideal====
The ideal transformer model neglects the following basic linear aspects in real transformers.

Core losses, collectively called magnetizing current losses, consist of<ref name="Say (1984)"/>
* [[Magnetic core#Core loss|Hysteresis]] losses due to nonlinear application of the voltage applied in the transformer core, and
* [[Magnetic core#Core loss|Eddy current]] losses due to joule heating in the core that are proportional to the square of the transformer's applied voltage.

Whereas windings in the ideal model have no resistances and infinite inductances, the windings in a real transformer have finite non-zero resistances and inductances associated with:
* [[Joule heating|Joule losses]] due to resistance in the primary and secondary windings<ref name="Say (1984)">{{cite book| last = Say| first = M. G.| title = Alternating Current Machines| edition = 5th| isbn = 0-470-27451-4| publisher = Halsted Press| year = 1984}}</ref>
* Leakage flux that escapes from the core and passes through one winding only resulting in primary and secondary reactive impedance.
[[Image:Transformer flux.gif|left|thumb|301px|Leakage flux of a transformer]]

====Leakage flux====
{{Main|Leakage inductance}}

The ideal transformer model assumes that all flux generated by the primary winding links all the turns of every winding, including itself. In practice, some flux traverses paths that take it outside the windings.<ref name="mclaren">{{cite book
| last = McLaren | first = P. G.
| title = Elementary Electric Power and Machines
| pages = 68<U+2013>74
| isbn = 0-13-257601-5
| year = 1984
}}</ref> Such flux is termed ''leakage flux'', and results in [[leakage inductance]] in [[series and parallel circuits|series]] with the mutually coupled transformer windings.<ref name="calvert"/> Leakage flux results in energy being alternately stored in and discharged from the magnetic fields with each cycle of the power supply. It is not directly a power loss, but results in inferior [[voltage regulation]], causing the secondary voltage not to be directly proportional to the primary voltage, particularly under heavy load.<ref name="mclaren"/> Transformers are therefore normally designed to have very low leakage inductance.

In some applications increased leakage is desired, and long magnetic paths, air gaps, or magnetic bypass shunts may deliberately be introduced in a transformer design to limit the [[Short circuit|short-circuit]] current it will supply.<ref name="calvert"/> Leaky transformers may be used to supply loads that exhibit [[negative resistance]], such as [[electric arc]]s, [[mercury vapor lamp]]s, and [[neon sign]]s or for safely handling loads that become periodically short-circuited such as [[arc welding|electric arc welders]].<ref name="Say, p. 485">Say, p. 485</ref>

Air gaps are also used to keep a transformer from saturating, especially audio-frequency transformers in circuits that have a DC component flowing in the windings.<ref>{{cite book|last=Terman|first=Frederick E.|title=Electronic and Radio Engineering| edition=4th |year=1955|publisher=McGraw-Hill|location=New York|pages=15}}</ref>

Knowledge of leakage inductance is also useful when transformers are operated in parallel. It can be shown that if the percent impedance{{efn|Percent impedance is the ratio of the voltage drop in the secondary from no load to full load; and is here represented with the variable ''Z''<ref>Heathcote, p. 4</ref>. In some texts, ''Z'' is used for absolute impedance instead.}} and associated winding leakage reactance-to-resistance (X/R) ratio of two transformers were hypothetically exactly the same, the transformers would share power in proportion to their respective volt-ampere ratings  (e.g. 500&nbsp;[[Kilovolt-ampere|kVA]] unit in parallel with 1,000&nbsp;kVA unit, the larger unit would carry twice the current). However, the impedance tolerances of commercial transformers are significant. Also, the Z impedance and X/R ratio of different capacity transformers tends to vary, corresponding 1,000&nbsp;kVA and 500&nbsp;kVA units' values being, to illustrate, respectively, Z ~ 5.75%, X/R ~ 3.75 and Z ~ 5%, X/R ~ 4.75.<ref name="Knowlton, p. 585-586">Knowlton, pp. 585-586</ref><ref name="Haymeyer (2001)">{{cite web|last=Haymeyer|year=2001|first=Kay|title=Electrical Machines I: Basics, Design, Function, Operation|publisher=RWTH Aachen University Institute of Electrical Machines|page=39}}</ref>

====Equivalent circuit====
{{See also|Induction motor#Steinmetz equivalent circuit|l1=Steinmetz equivalent circuit}}

Referring to the diagram, a practical transformer's physical behavior may be represented by an [[equivalent circuit]] model, which can incorporate an ideal transformer.<ref name="daniels">{{cite book
| last=Daniels
| first= A. R.
| title=Introduction to Electrical Machines

Winding joule losses and leakage reactances are represented by the following series loop impedances of the model:
* Primary winding: ''R''<sub>P</sub>, ''X''<sub>P</sub>
* Secondary winding:  ''R''<sub>S</sub>, ''X''<sub>S</sub>.
In normal course of circuit equivalence transformation, ''R''<sub>S</sub> and ''X''<sub>S</sub> are in practice usually referred to the primary side by multiplying these impedances by the turns ratio squared, (''N''<sub>P</sub>/''N''<sub>S</sub>)<sup>&nbsp;2</sup>&nbsp;=&nbsp;a<sup>2</sup>.

[[Image:TREQCCT.jpg|thumb|500px|Real transformer equivalent circuit]]
Core loss and reactance is represented by the following shunt leg impedances of the model:
* Core or iron losses: ''R''<sub>C</sub>
* Magnetizing reactance: ''X''<sub>M</sub>.
''R''<sub>C</sub> and ''X''<sub>M</sub> are collectively termed the ''magnetizing branch'' of the model.

Core losses are caused mostly by hysteresis and eddy current effects in the core and are proportional to the square of the core flux for operation at a given frequency.<ref name="Say, pp. 142<U+2013>143">Say, pp. 142-143</ref> The finite permeability core requires a magnetizing current ''I''<sub>M</sub> to maintain mutual flux in the core. Magnetizing current is in phase with the flux, the relationship between the two being non-linear due to saturation effects. However, all impedances of the equivalent circuit shown are by definition linear and such non-linearity effects are not typically reflected in transformer equivalent circuits.<ref name="Say, pp. 142<U+2013>143"/> With [[sinusoidal]] supply, core flux lags the induced emf by&nbsp;90<U+00B0>.  With open-circuited secondary winding, magnetizing branch current ''I''<sub>0</sub> equals transformer no-load current.<ref name="daniels"/>

The resulting model, though sometimes termed 'exact' equivalent circuit based on [[linearity]] assumptions, retains a number of approximations.<ref name="daniels"/> Analysis may be simplified by assuming that magnetizing branch impedance is relatively high and relocating the branch to the left of the primary impedances. This introduces error but allows combination of primary and referred secondary resistances and reactances by simple summation as two series impedances.

Transformer equivalent circuit impedance and transformer ratio parameters can be derived from the following tests: [[open-circuit test]],{{efn|A standardized open-circuit or unloaded transformer test called the [[Epstein frame]] can also be used for the characterization of magnetic properties of soft magnetic materials including especially electrical steels.<ref>[http://webstore.iec.ch/webstore/webstore.nsf/mysearchajax?Openform&key=60404-2&sorting=&start=1&onglet=1 IEC Std 60404-2 Magnetic Materials - Part 2: Methods of Measurement of the Magnetic Properties . . .]</ref>}} [[short-circuit test]], winding resistance test, and transformer ratio test.

===Effect of frequency===
<div style="float:right; padding:1em; margin:0 0 0 1em; width:300px; border:1px solid; background:ivory;">
{{anchor|Transformer universal emf equation}}
'''Transformer universal emf equation'''

If the flux in the core is purely [[sinusoidal]], the relationship for either winding between its '''[[root mean square|rms]] voltage''' ''E<sub>rms</sub>'' of the winding, and the supply frequency ''f'', number of turns ''N'', core cross-sectional area ''a'' in m<sup>2</sup> and peak magnetic flux density ''B<sub>peak</sub>'' in Wb/m<sup>2</sup> or T (tesla)  is given by the universal emf equation:<ref name="Say (1984)"/>

<math> E_\text{rms} = {\frac {2 \pi f N a B_\text{peak}} {\sqrt{2}}} \! = 4.44 f N a B_{{peak}}</math>

If the flux does not contain even [[harmonics]] the following equation can be used for '''half-cycle average voltage''' ''E''<sub>avg</sub> of any waveshape:

<math> E_\text{avg}= 4 f N a B_\text{peak} \!</math>
</div>
By Faraday's Law of induction shown in eq. (1) and (2), transformer emf voltages vary according to the time derivative of flux with respect to time.  <ref name="Haymeyerp11">Haymeyer, p. 11, eq. 2-13</ref> The ideal transformer's core behaves linearly with time for any non-zero frequency.<ref name="Crosby (1958)"/><ref name="billings">{{cite book| last=Billings| first=Keith| title=Switchmode Power Supply Handbook| publisher=McGraw-Hill| year=1999| isbn = 0-07-006719-8}}</ref> Flux in a real transformer's core behaves non-linearly in relation to magnetization current as the instantaneous flux increases beyond a finite linear range resulting in [[saturation (magnetic)|magnetic saturation]] associated with increasingly large magnetizing current, which eventually leads to transformer overheating. 

The emf of a transformer at a given flux density increases with frequency.<ref name="Say (1984)"/> By operating at higher frequencies, transformers can be physically more compact because a given core is able to transfer more power without reaching saturation and fewer turns are needed to achieve the same impedance. However, properties such as core loss and conductor [[skin effect]] also increase with frequency. Aircraft and military equipment employ 400&nbsp;Hz power supplies which reduce core and winding weight.<ref>{{cite web | title = 400 Hz Electrical Systems | work = Aerospaceweb.org | url = http://www.aerospaceweb.org/question/electronics/q0219.shtml | accessdate = May 21, 2007}}</ref> Conversely, frequencies used for some [[railway electrification system]]s were much lower (e.g. 16.7&nbsp;Hz and 25&nbsp;Hz) than normal utility frequencies (50 <U+2013> 60&nbsp;Hz) for historical reasons concerned mainly with the limitations of early [[traction motor|electric traction motors]]. As such, the transformers used to step-down the high over-head line voltages (e.g. 15&nbsp;kV) were much heavier for the same power rating than those designed only for the higher frequencies.

Operation of a transformer at its designed voltage but at a higher frequency than intended will lead to reduced magnetizing current. At a lower frequency, the magnetizing current will increase. Operation of a transformer at other than its design frequency may require assessment of voltages, losses, and cooling to establish if safe operation is practical. For example, transformers may need to be equipped with 'volts per hertz' over-excitation [[protective relay|relays]] to protect the transformer from overvoltage at higher than rated frequency.

One example of state-of-the-art design is traction transformers used for [[electric multiple unit]] and [[High-speed rail|high-speed]] train service operating across the country border and using different electrical standards, such transformers' being restricted to be positioned below the passenger compartment. The power supply to, and converter equipment being supply by, such traction transformers have to accommodate different input frequencies and voltage (ranging from as high as 50&nbsp;Hz down to 16.7&nbsp;Hz and rated up to 25&nbsp;kV) while being suitable for multiple AC asynchronous motor and DC converters & motors with varying harmonics mitigation filtering requirements.

Large power transformers are vulnerable to insulation failure due to transient voltages with high-frequency components, such as caused in switching or by lightning.<ref name="Gururaj (1963)">{{cite journal| last=Gururaj| first=B.I.| title=Natural Frequencies of 3-Phase Transformer Windings| journal=IEEE Transactions on Power Apparatus and Systems|volume=82| issue=66|date=June 1963| pages=318<U+2013>329| doi=10.1109/TPAS.1963.291359| url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/freeabs_all.jsp?isnumber=4072786&arnumber=4072800&count=25&index=12}}</ref>

===Energy losses===
Real transformer energy losses are dominated by winding resistance joule and core losses. Transformers' efficiency tends to improve with increasing transformer capacity.

As transformer losses vary with load, it is often useful to express these losses in terms of no-load loss, full-load loss, half-load loss, and so on. [[Hysteresis]] and [[eddy current]] losses are constant at all load levels and dominate overwhelmingly without load, while variable winding [[electrical resistance|joule losses]] dominating increasingly as load increases.  The no-load loss can be significant, so that even an idle transformer constitutes a drain on the electrical supply. Designing [[energy efficient transformer]]s for lower loss requires a larger core, good-quality [[Electrical steel|silicon steel]], or even [[Electrical steel#Amorphous steel|amorphous steel]] for the core and thicker wire, increasing initial cost. The choice of construction represents a [[trade-off]] between initial cost and operating cost.<ref name="Heathcote, pp. 41-42">Heathcote, pp. 41-42</ref>

Transformer losses arise from:
; '''Winding joule losses'''
:Current flowing through winding conductors causes [[joule heating]]. As frequency increases, skin effect and [[proximity effect (electromagnetism)|proximity effect]] causes winding resistance and, hence, losses to increase.
;[[magnetic core#Core loss|Core losses]]
:; '''Hysteresis losses'''
::Each time the magnetic field is reversed, a small amount of energy is lost due to hysteresis within the core. According to Steinmetz's formula, the heat energy due to hysteresis is given by
:::<math>W_h\approx\eta\beta^{1.6}_{max}</math>, and,
::hysteresis loss is thus given by
:::<math>P_h\approx{W}_hf\approx\eta{f}\beta^{1.6}_{max}</math>
::where, f is the frequency, <U+03B7> is the hysteresis coefficient and <U+03B2><sub>max</sub> is the maximum flux density, the empirical exponent of which varies from about 1.4 to 1 .8 but is often given as 1.6 for iron.<ref name="Heathcote, pp. 41-42"/><ref>Knowlton, pp. 49 (<U+00A7>2.67) & 323 (<U+00A7>4.279)</ref><ref name=EE-Reviewonline.com>{{cite web|last=EE-Reviewonline.com|title=Steinmetz's Formula for Magnetic Hysteresis|url=http://www.ee-reviewonline.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=534%3Asteinmetzs-formula-for-magnetic-hysteresis&catid=65%3Amagnetic-circuits&Itemid=44|accessdate=7 February 2013}}</ref>
:; '''Eddy current losses'''
::[[Ferromagnetic]] materials are also good [[electrical conductor|conductors]] and a core made from such a material also constitutes a single short-circuited turn throughout its entire length. [[Eddy current]]s therefore circulate within the core in a plane normal to the flux, and are responsible for [[resistive heating]] of the core material. The eddy current loss is a complex function of the square of supply frequency and inverse square of the material thickness.<ref name="Heathcote, pp. 41-42"/> Eddy current losses can be reduced by making the core of a stack of plates electrically insulated from each other, rather than a solid block; all transformers operating at low frequencies use laminated or similar cores.
; '''Magnetostriction related transformer hum'''
:Magnetic flux in a ferromagnetic material, such as the core, causes it to physically expand and contract slightly with each cycle of the magnetic field, an effect known as [[magnetostriction]], the frictional energy of which produces an audible noise known as [[mains hum]] or [[Mains hum|transformer hum]].<ref name="Winders (2002)"/><ref name="PF (nd)">{{cite web|title=Understanding Transformer Noise|url=http://www.federalpacific.com/literature/drytrans/10transformernoise.pdf|publisher=FP|accessdate=30 January 2013}}</ref>  This transformer hum is especially objectionable in transformers supplied at [[utility frequency|power frequencies]]{{efn|Transformer hum's fundamental noise frequency is two times that of the power frequency as there is an extension and a contraction of core laminations for every cycle of the AC wave and a transformer's audible hum noise level is dominated by the [[fundamental frequency|fundamental noise frequency]] and its first triplen [[harmonic series (mathematics)|harmonic]], i.e., by the 100 & 300 Hz, or 120 & 360 Hz, frequencies.<ref name="PF (nd)"/>}}  and in [[high-frequency]] [[flyback transformer]]s associated with PAL system [[Cathode ray tube|CRTs]].
; '''Stray losses''' <div id="stray"/>
:Leakage inductance is by itself largely lossless, since energy supplied to its magnetic fields is returned to the supply with the next half-cycle. However, any leakage flux that intercepts nearby conductive materials such as the transformer's support structure will give rise to eddy currents and be converted to heat.<ref name="nailen">{{Cite journal

===Core form and shell form transformers===
[[File:Transformer winding formats.jpg|thumb|225px|right| Core form = core type; shell form = shell type]]
Closed-core transformers are constructed in 'core form' or 'shell form'. When windings surround the core, the transformer is core form; when windings are surrounded by the core, the transformer is shell form. Shell form design may be more prevalent than core form design for distribution transformer applications due to the relative ease in stacking the core around winding coils.<ref name="Del Vecchio (2002)"/> Core form design tends to, as a general rule, be more economical, and therefore more prevalent, than shell form design for high voltage power transformer applications at the lower end of their voltage and power rating ranges (less than or equal to, nominally, 230&nbsp;kV or 75&nbsp;MVA).  At higher voltage and power ratings, shell form transformers tend to be more prevalent.<ref name="Del Vecchio (2002)"/><ref name="Knowlton, p. 562"/><ref name="HRTSG (2005)">{{cite web|last=Hydroelectric Research and Technical Services Group|title=Transformers: Basics, Maintenance, and Diagnostics|url=http://permanent.access.gpo.gov/lps113746/Trnsfrmr.pdf|publisher=U.S. Dept. of the Interior, Bureau of Reclamation|accessdate=Mar 27, 2012|page=12}}</ref><ref name="EM 1110-2-3006 (1994)">{{cite conference|last=EM 1110-2-3006|booktitle=Engineering and Design - Hydroelectric Power Plants Electrical Design|title=Chapter 4 - Power Transformers

[[Image:Laminering av k<U+00E4>rna.svg|thumb|upright|left|Laminating the core greatly reduces eddy-current losses]]

One common design of laminated core is made from interleaved stacks of [[E-shaped]] steel sheets capped with [[I-shaped]] pieces, leading to its name of 'E-I transformer'.<ref name="McLyman (2004)"/> Such a design tends to exhibit more losses, but is very economical to manufacture. The cut-core or C-core type is made by winding a steel strip around a rectangular form and then bonding the layers together. It is then cut in two, forming two C shapes, and the core assembled by binding the two C halves together with a steel strap.<ref name="McLyman (2004)"/> They have the advantage that the flux is always oriented parallel to the metal grains, reducing reluctance.

A steel core's [[remanence]] means that it retains a static magnetic field when power is removed. When power is then reapplied, the residual field will cause a high [[inrush current]] until the effect of the remaining magnetism is reduced, usually after a few cycles of the applied AC waveform.<ref name="Harlow (2004a)">{{cite conference|last=Sim|first=H.

Distribution transformers can achieve low no-load losses by using cores made with low-loss high-permeability silicon steel or [[Amorphous#Metallic glass|amorphous (non-crystalline) metal alloy]].

====Solid cores====
Powdered iron cores are used in circuits such as switch-mode power supplies that operate above mains frequencies and up to a few tens of kilohertz. These materials combine high magnetic permeability with high bulk electrical [[resistivity]]. For frequencies extending beyond the [[Very high frequency|VHF band]], cores made from non-conductive magnetic [[ceramic]] materials called [[ferrite (magnet)|ferrites]] are common.<ref name="McLyman (2004)"/> Some radio-frequency transformers also have movable cores (sometimes called 'slugs') which allow adjustment of the [[coupling coefficient]] (and [[bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]]) of tuned radio-frequency circuits.

====Toroidal cores====
[[Image:Small toroidal transformer.jpg|thumb|right|Small toroidal core transformer]]
Toroidal transformers are built around a ring-shaped core, which, depending on operating frequency, is made from a long strip of [[silicon steel]] or [[permalloy]] wound into a coil, powdered iron, or [[ferrite (magnet)|ferrite]].<ref>McLyman, Chap. 3 p. 1</ref> A strip construction ensures that the [[grain boundary|grain boundaries]] are optimally aligned, improving the transformer's efficiency by reducing the core's [[reluctance]]. The closed ring shape eliminates air gaps inherent in the construction of an E-I core.<ref name="Say, p. 485"/> The cross-section of the ring is usually square or rectangular, but more expensive cores with circular cross-sections are also available. The primary and secondary coils are often wound concentrically to cover the entire surface of the core. This minimizes the length of wire needed, and also provides screening to minimize the core's magnetic field from generating [[electromagnetic interference]].

Toroidal transformers are more efficient than the cheaper laminated E-I types for a similar power level. Other advantages compared to E-I types, include smaller size (about half), lower weight (about half), less mechanical hum (making them superior in audio amplifiers), lower exterior magnetic field (about one tenth), low off-load losses (making them more efficient in standby circuits), single-bolt mounting, and greater choice of shapes. The main disadvantages are higher cost and limited power capacity (see [[transformer#Classification parameters|Classification parameters]] below).  Because of the lack of a residual gap in the magnetic path, toroidal transformers also tend to exhibit higher inrush current, compared to laminated E-I types.

Ferrite toroidal cores are used at higher frequencies, typically between a few tens of kilohertz to hundreds of megahertz, to reduce losses, physical size, and weight of inductive components. A drawback of toroidal transformer construction is the higher labor cost of winding. This is because it is necessary to pass the entire length of a coil winding through the core aperture each time a single turn is added to the coil. As a consequence, toroidal transformers rated more than a few kVA are uncommon. Small distribution transformers may achieve some of the benefits of a toroidal core by splitting it and forcing it open, then inserting a bobbin containing primary and secondary windings.

====Air cores====
<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:AirCoreSymbol.png|100px|thumb|[[Electronic symbol]] for Air Cores]] -->
A physical core is not an absolute requisite and a functioning transformer can be produced simply by placing the windings near each other, an arrangement termed an 'air-core' transformer. The air which comprises the magnetic circuit is essentially lossless, and so an air-core transformer eliminates loss due to hysteresis in the core material.<ref name="calvert"/> The leakage inductance is inevitably high, resulting in very poor regulation, and so such designs are unsuitable for use in power distribution.<ref name="calvert"/> They have however very high [[bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]], and are frequently employed in radio-frequency applications,<ref>{{cite web

They're also used for [[Resonant inductive coupling|resonant transformers]] such as Tesla coils where they can achieve reasonably low loss in spite of the high leakage inductance.

===Windings===
[[Image:Transformer-hightolow smaller.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Windings are usually arranged concentrically to minimize flux leakage.]]
{{mergefrom |Compensation winding|date=March 2014}}
The [[electrical conductor|conducting material]] used for the windings depends upon the application, but in all cases the individual turns must be electrically insulated from each other to ensure that the current travels throughout every turn.<ref name="Dixon (1997)">{{cite journal|last=Dixon|first=L.H., Jr.|url=http://focus.ti.com/lit/ml/slup197/slup197.pdf| title=Eddy Current Losses in Transformer Windings|year=1997|publisher=Texas Instrument|pages=R2<U+2013>1<U+2013>to<U+2013>R2<U+2013>10}}</ref> For small power and signal transformers, in which currents are low and the potential difference between adjacent turns is small, the coils are often wound from [[enameled wire|enamelled magnet wire]], such as [[Formvar]] wire.

High-frequency transformers operating in the tens to hundreds of kilohertz often have windings made of braided [[Litz wire]] to minimize the skin-effect and proximity effect losses.<ref name="dixon">{{Cite conference | first = Lloyd| last = Dixon| booktitle = Magnetics Design Handbook| title = Power Transformer Design| url = http://focus.ti.com/lit/ml/slup126/slup126.pdf| year=2001| publisher = Texas Instruments}}</ref> Large power transformers use multiple-stranded conductors as well, since even at low power frequencies non-uniform distribution of current would otherwise exist in high-current windings.<ref name="cegb_1982"/> Each strand is individually insulated, and the strands are arranged so that at certain points in the winding, or throughout the whole winding, each portion occupies different relative positions in the complete conductor. The transposition equalizes the current flowing in each strand of the conductor, and reduces eddy current losses in the winding itself. The stranded conductor is also more flexible than a solid conductor of similar size, aiding manufacture.<ref name="cegb_1982"/>

The windings of signal transformers minimize leakage inductance and stray capacitance to improve high-frequency response. Coils are split into sections, and those sections interleaved between the sections of the other winding.

Power-frequency transformers may have [[Tap (transformer)|taps]] at intermediate points on the winding, usually on the higher voltage winding side, for voltage adjustment. Taps may be manually reconnected, or a manual or automatic switch may be provided for changing taps. Automatic on-load [[tap changer]]s are used in electric power transmission or distribution, on equipment such as [[arc furnace]] transformers, or for automatic voltage regulators for sensitive loads. Audio-frequency transformers, used for the distribution of audio to public address loudspeakers, have taps to allow adjustment of impedance to each speaker. A [[Center tap|center-tapped transformer]] is often used in the output stage of an audio power [[amplifier]] in a [[Push-pull converter|push-pull circuit]]. Modulation transformers in [[Amplitude modulation|AM]] transmitters are very similar.

Dry-type transformer winding insulation systems can be either of standard open-wound 'dip-and-bake' construction or of higher quality designs that include [[vacuum|vacuum pressure impregnation]] (VPI), [[vacuum|vacuum pressure encapsulation]] (VPE), and [[Transformer types#Cast resin tranformer|cast coil encapsulation]] processes.<ref name="Lane (2007)">{{cite web|last=Lane|first=Keith (2007)|title=The Basics of Large Dry-Type Transformers|url=http://ecmweb.com/content/basics-large-dry-type-transformers|publisher=EC&M|accessdate=29 January 2013}}</ref>  In the VPI process,  a combination of heat, vacuum and pressure is used to thoroughly seal, bind, and eliminate entrained air voids in the winding polyester resin insulation coat layer, thus increasing resistance to corona.  VPE windings are similar to VPI windings but provide more protection against environmental effects, such as from water, dirt or corrosive ambients, by multiple dips including typically in terms of final epoxy coat.<ref>Heathcote, pp. 720<U+2013>723</ref>

Experimental power transformers in the 500<U+2010>to<U+2010>1,000&nbsp;kVA range have been built with [[liquid nitrogen]] or [[liquid helium|helium]] cooled [[superconductivity|superconducting]] windings, which eliminates winding losses without affecting core losses.<ref name="Mehta (1997)">{{cite journal|last=Mehta|first=S.P.|author2=Aversa, N.|author3=Walker, M.S.|title=Transforming Transformers [Superconducting windings]|journal=IEEE Spectrum|date=Jul 1997|volume=34|issue=7|pages=43<U+2013>49|doi=10.1109/6.609815|url=http://www.superpower-inc.com/files/T141+IEEE+Spectrum+XFR.pdf|accessdate=14 November 2012}}</ref><ref>Pansini, pp. 66<U+2013>67</ref>

===Insulation drying===
Construction of oil-filled transformers requires that the insulation covering the windings be thoroughly dried of residual moisture before the oil is introduced. Drying is carried out at the factory, and may also be required as a field service. Drying may be done by circulating hot air around the core, or by vapor-phase drying (VPD) where an evaporated solvent transfers heat by condensation on the coil and core.

For small transformers, resistance heating by injection of current into the windings is used. The heating can be controlled very well, and it is energy efficient. The method is called low-frequency heating (LFH) since the current used is at a much lower frequency than that of the power grid, which is normally 50 or 60&nbsp;Hz. A lower frequency reduces the effect of inductance, so the voltage required can be reduced.<ref>{{cite book|last=Fink|first= Donald G.|author2= Beatty, H.

==Applications==
[[File:Transformer-Limestone-Generating-Station.JPG|thumb|right|Transformer at the [[Limestone Generating Station]] in [[Manitoba]], [[Canada]]]]

Transformers are used to increase voltage before transmitting electrical energy over long distances through [[wire]]s. Wires have [[Electrical resistance|resistance]] which loses energy through joule heating at a rate corresponding to square of the current. By transforming power to a higher voltage transformers enable economical transmission of power and distribution. Consequently, transformers have shaped the [[Electrical power industry|electricity supply industry]], permitting generation to be located remotely from points of [[electrical load|demand]].<ref>Heathcote, p. 1</ref> All but a tiny fraction of the world's electrical power has passed through a series of transformers by the time it reaches the consumer.<ref name="nailen"/>

Transformers are also used extensively in [[Consumer electronics|electronic products]] to step-down the supply voltage to a level suitable for the low voltage circuits they contain. The transformer also electrically isolates the end user from contact with the supply voltage.

Signal and audio transformers are used to couple stages of [[amplifier]]s and to match devices such as [[microphone]]s and [[record player]]s to the input of amplifiers. Audio transformers allowed [[telephone]] circuits to carry on a [[Hybrid coil|two-way conversation]] over a single pair of wires. A [[balun]] transformer converts a signal that is referenced to ground to a signal that has [[Balanced line|balanced voltages to ground]], such as between external cables and internal circuits.

==History==
===Discovery of induction===
[[Image:Induction experiment.png|thumb|right|270px|Faraday's experiment with induction between coils of wire<ref>{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=JzBAAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA285| last=Poyser| first=Arthur William|year=1892|title=Magnetism and Electricity: A Manual for Students in Advanced Classes| location=London and New York|publisher= Longmans, Green, & Co.| page= 285, fig. 248| accessdate= Aug 6, 2009}}</ref>]]

Electromagnetic induction, the principle of the operation of the transformer, was discovered independently and almost simultaneously by [[Joseph Henry]] and [[Michael Faraday]] in 1831. Although Henry's work likely having preceded Faraday's work by a few months {{cn|date=July 2014}}, Faraday was the first to publish the results of his experiments and thus receive credit for the discovery.<ref name="HenryNAS">{{cite web |url=http://www.nas.edu/history/members/henry.html |title=Joseph Henry|authorlink=Joseph Henry|accessdate=Nov 30, 2006 |work=Distinguished Members Gallery, National Academy of Sciences}}</ref> The relationship between emf and magnetic flux is an equation now known as [[Faraday's law of induction]]:

where <math>|\mathcal{E}|</math> is the magnitude of the emf in volts and <U+03A6><sub>''B''</sub> is the magnetic flux through the circuit in [[Weber (unit)|webers]].<ref name="Chow171">{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=dpnpMhw1zo8C&pg=PA171&dq=isbn%3D0763738271+%22Time-Dependent+Magnetic+fields+and+Faraday%27s+Law+of+Induction%22&cd=1#v=onepage&q=&f=false|last= Chow|first= Tai L. |year=2006|title=Introduction to Electromagnetic Theory: A Modern Perspective| location=Sudbury, Mass.| publisher=Jones and Bartlett Publishers| page= 171| isbn=0-7637-3827-1}}</ref>

Faraday performed the first experiments on induction between coils of wire, including winding a pair of coils around an iron ring, thus creating the first [[Toroid (geometry)|toroidal]] closed-core transformer.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Faraday|first=Michael|year=1834|title=Experimental Researches on Electricity, 7th Series|authorlink=Michael Faraday|journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society|volume=124|pages=77<U+2013>122|doi=10.1098/rstl.1834.0008|url=http://archive.org/details/philtrans08694360}}</ref>  However he only applied individual pulses of current to his transformer, and never discovered the relation between the turns ratio and emf in the windings.

===Induction coils===
[[Image:Faradays transformer.png|thumb|right|Faraday's ring transformer]]
The first type of transformer to see wide use was the [[induction coil]], invented by Rev. [[Nicholas Callan]] of [[Maynooth College]], Ireland in 1836. He was one of the first researchers to realize the more turns the secondary winding has in relation to the primary winding, the larger the induced secondary emf will be. Induction coils evolved from scientists' and inventors' efforts to get higher voltages from batteries. Since batteries produce [[direct current|direct current (DC)]] rather than AC, induction coils relied upon vibrating [[electrical contact]]s that regularly interrupted the current in the primary to create the flux changes necessary for induction. Between the 1830s and the 1870s, efforts to build better induction coils, mostly by trial and error, slowly revealed the basic principles of transformers.

===First alternating current transformers===
By the 1870s, efficient [[Electric generator|generators]] producing [[alternating current|alternating current (AC)]] were available, and it was found AC could power an induction coil directly, without an [[interrupter]].

In 1876, Russian engineer [[Pavel Yablochkov]] invented a lighting system based on a set of induction coils where the primary windings were connected to a source of AC. The secondary windings could be connected to several [[Yablochkov candle|'electric candles']] (arc lamps) of his own design.<ref name=maglab>{{Cite web

===Early series circuit transformer distribution===
Induction coils with open magnetic circuits are inefficient at transferring power to [[Electrical load|loads]]. Until about 1880, the paradigm for AC power transmission from a high voltage supply to a low voltage load was a series circuit. Open-core transformers with a ratio near 1:1 were connected with their primaries in series to allow use of a high voltage for transmission while presenting a low voltage to the lamps. The inherent flaw in this method was that turning off a single lamp (or other electric device) affected the voltage supplied to all others on the same circuit. Many adjustable transformer designs were introduced to compensate for this problematic characteristic of the series circuit, including those employing methods of adjusting the core or bypassing the magnetic flux around part of a coil.<ref name=FJU1889/>
Efficient, practical transformer designs did not appear until the 1880s, but within a decade, the transformer would be instrumental in the [[War of Currents]], and in seeing AC distribution systems triumph over their DC counterparts, a position in which they have remained dominant ever since.<ref name="Coltman">{{Cite news

Although [[George Westinghouse]] had bought Gaulard and Gibbs' patents in 1885, the [[Edison Electric Light Company]] held an option on the US rights for the ZBD transformers, requiring Westinghouse to pursue alternative designs on the same principles. He assigned to [[William Stanley, Jr.|William Stanley]] the task of developing a device for commercial use in United States.<ref name="Skrabec">{{cite book|last=Skrabec|first=Quentin R.|title=George Westinghouse: Gentle Genius|publisher=Algora Publishing|year=2007|page=102|isbn=978-0-87586-508-9|url=http://books.google.com/?id=C3GYdiFM41oC&pg=PA102}}</ref> Stanley's first patented design was for induction coils with single cores of soft iron and adjustable gaps to regulate the emf present in the secondary winding (see image).<ref name="Stanley_adj_gap_ind_coil"/> This design<ref name="Coltman (2002)">{{cite journal|last=Coltman|first=J.W.;|title=The Transformer [Historical Overview]|journal=Industry Applications Magazine, IEEE|date=Jan<U+2013>Feb 2002|volume=8|issue=1|pages=8<U+2013>15|doi=10.1109/2943.974352|url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpls/abs_all.jsp?arnumber=974352|accessdate=Feb 29, 2012}}</ref> was first used commercially in the US in 1886<ref name="Coltman">{{cite book

Westinghouse, Stanley and associates soon developed an easier to manufacture core, consisting of a stack of thin 'E<U+2011>shaped' iron plates, insulated by thin sheets of paper or other insulating material. Prewound copper coils could then be slid into place, and straight iron plates laid in to create a closed magnetic circuit. Westinghouse applied for a patent for the new low-cost design in December 1886; it was granted in July 1887.<ref name="Smil"/><ref>{{cite web|last=Westinghouse|first=George, Jr.|url=http://www.google.com/patents/about?id=NmRDAAAAEBAJ&dq=366362|title=Electrical Converter|publisher=U.S. Patent 366 362, issued July 12, 1887|authorlink=George Westinghouse}}</ref>

===Other early transformers===
In 1889, Russian-born engineer [[Mikhail Dolivo-Dobrovolsky]] developed the first [[three-phase]] transformer at the [[Allgemeine Elektricit<U+00E4>ts-Gesellschaft]] ('General Electricity Company') in Germany.<ref>{{cite book|last=Neidh<U+00F6>fer|first= Gerhard|others=In collaboration with VDE "History of Electrical Engineering" Committee|location= Berlin | isbn= 978-3-8007-3115-2|url=http://d-nb.info/990964361|title=Michael von Dolivo-Dobrowolsky and Three-Phase: The Beginnings of Modern Drive Technology and Power Supply |language=German|year=2008|publisher=VDE-Verl.|edition=2}}</ref>

In 1891, [[Nikola Tesla]] invented the [[Tesla coil]], an air-cored, dual-tuned resonant transformer for generating very [[high voltage]]s at high frequency.<ref name="PBS">{{cite web|last=Uth|first=Robert|title=Tesla Coil|date=Dec 12, 2000|work=Tesla: Master of Lightning|publisher=PBS.org|url=http://www.pbs.org/tesla/ins/lab_tescoil.html|accessdate=May 20, 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO1&Sect2=HITOFF&d=PALL&p=1&u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsrchnum.htm&r=1&f=G&l=50&s1=0454622.PN.&OS=PN/0454622&RS=PN/0454622|last=Tesla|first=Nikola|title=System of Electrical Lighting|publisher=U.S. Patent 454 622, issued June 23, 1891|authorlink=Nikola Tesla}}</ref>
