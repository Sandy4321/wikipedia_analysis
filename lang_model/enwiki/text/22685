'''Queen Anne's War''' (1702<U+2013>1713), as the North American [[theater (warfare)|theater]] of the [[War of the Spanish Succession]] was known in the [[British colonization of the Americas|English colonies]], was the second in a series of [[French and Indian Wars]] fought between [[Early Modern France|France]] and [[Kingdom of England|England]] (later [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Great Britain]])<ref name="GB">In 1707, the kingdoms of [[Kingdom of England|England]] and [[Kingdom of Scotland|Scotland]] were unified as the [[Kingdom of Great Britain]], sharing a single Parliament at Westminster under the [[Act of Union 1707]].  After this, Scottish troops joined their English counterparts in all colonial wars.</ref> in North America for control of the continent.  The War of the Spanish Succession was primarily fought in Europe.  In addition to the two main combatants, the war also involved numerous [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] tribes allied with each nation, and [[Spain]], which was allied with France.

The war was fought on three fronts:
# [[Spanish Florida]] and the English [[Province of Carolina]] were also each subjected to attacks from the other, and the English engaged the French based at [[Mobile, Alabama|Mobile]] in what was essentially a proxy war involving primarily allied Indians on both sides.  The southern war, although it did not result in significant territorial changes, had the effect of nearly wiping out the Indian population of Spanish Florida, including parts of present-day southern [[Georgia (U. S. state)|Georgia]], and destroying Spain's [[Spanish missions in Florida|network of missions]] in the area.
# The English colonies of [[New England]] fought with French and Indian forces based in [[Acadia]] and [[Canada, New France|Canada]]. [[Quebec City|Quebec]] was repeatedly targeted (but never successfully reached) by British expeditions, and the Acadian capital [[Port Royal, Nova Scotia|Port Royal]] was [[Siege of Port Royal (1710)|taken in 1710]].  The French and Indians executed raids against targets in [[Province of Massachusetts Bay|Massachusetts]] (including present-day [[Maine]]), most famously [[Raid on Deerfield|raiding Deerfield]] in 1704.
# On [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]], English colonists based at [[St. John's, Newfoundland and Labrador|St. John's]] disputed control of the island with the French based at [[Plaisance, Newfoundland and Labrador|Plaisance]].  Most of the conflict consisted of economically destructive raids against the other side's settlements.  The French successfully captured [[Battle of St. John's|St. John's]] in 1709, but the British quickly reoccupied it after the French abandoned it.

Following a preliminary peace in 1712, the [[Treaty of Utrecht (1713)|Treaty of Utrecht]] ended the war in 1713.  It resulted in the French cession of claims to the territories of [[Hudson Bay]], Acadia, and Newfoundland to Britain, while retaining [[Cape Breton Island|Cape Breton]] and other islands in the [[Gulf of St. Lawrence]].  Some of its terms were ambiguous, and concerns of various Indian tribes were not included in the treaty, setting the stage for future conflicts.

==Background==
{{Details|War of the Spanish Succession|causes of the war in Europe}}
In 1701, following the death in late 1700 of King [[Charles II of Spain]], [[War of the Spanish Succession|war broke out]] over who should succeed him to the Spanish throne.  Although the war was at first restricted to a few powers in Europe, in May 1702 it widened when [[Kingdom of England|England]] declared war on [[Spain]] and [[France]].<ref>Thomas, pp. 405<U+2013>407</ref> The  hostilities in North America were further encouraged by existing frictions along the frontier areas separating the colonies of these powers.  This disharmony was most pronounced along the northern and southwestern frontiers of the [[British colonization of the Americas|English colonies]], which then stretched from the [[Province of Carolina]] in the south to the [[Province of Massachusetts Bay]] in the north, with additional colonial settlements or trading outposts on [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]] and at [[Hudson Bay]].<ref>Stone, pp. 161, 165</ref>

The total population of the English colonies at the time has been estimated at 250,000, with [[Colony of Virginia|Virginia]] and [[New England]] dominating.<ref>Craven, p. 288</ref> The population centers of these colonies were concentrated along the coast, with small settlements inland, sometimes reaching as far as the [[Appalachian Mountains]].<ref>See e.g. the map in Winsor, p. 341, showing a 1687 map of the southeastern colonies</ref>  Most Europeans colonists knew very little of the interior of the continent, to the west of the Appalachians and south of the [[Great Lakes]].  This area was dominated by native tribes, although French and English traders had penetrated the area.  Spanish [[missionaries]] in [[Spanish Florida|''La Florida'']] had established a [[Spanish missions in Florida|network of missions]], pacifying and converting to [[Christianity]] many of the local natives.<ref>Weber, pp. 100<U+2013>107</ref>  The Spanish population was relatively small (about 1,500), and the Indian population they ministered to has been estimated to number 20,000.<ref>Cooper and Terrill, p. 22</ref>  French explorers had located the mouth of the [[Mississippi River]], near which established a small colonial presence in 1699 at [[Fort Maurepas]] (near present-day [[Biloxi, Mississippi]]).<ref>Weber, p. 158</ref> From there they began to establish trade routes into the interior, establishing friendly relations with the [[Choctaw]], a large tribe whose natural enemies included the British-allied [[Chickasaw]].<ref>Crane, p. 385</ref>  All of these populations had suffered to some degree from the introduction of Eurasian [[infectious disease]]s like [[smallpox]] by early explorers and traders.<ref>Waselkov and Hatley, p. 104</ref>

[[File:QueenAnne1702.jpg|thumb|right|[[Anne of Great Britain|Queen Anne]] was occupied with the conflict during her reign.]]
The arrival of the French in the South threatened existing trade links that Carolina colonists had established into the interior, and Spanish territorial claims, creating tension among all three powers.  France and Spain, allies in this conflict, had been on opposite sides of the recently ended [[Nine Years' War]].<ref>Weber, pp. 158<U+2013>159</ref>  Conflicting territorial claims between Carolina and Florida south of the [[Savannah River]] were overlaid by animosity over religious divisions between the [[Roman Catholic]] Spanish and the [[Protestant]] English along the coast.<ref name=Arnade32>Arnade, p. 32</ref>

To the north, the conflict held a strong economic component in addition to territorial disputes.  Newfoundland was the site of a British colony based at [[St. John's, Newfoundland and Labrador|St. John's]], and the French colonial base was at [[Plaisance, Newfoundland and Labrador|Plaisance]], with both sides also holding a number of smaller permanent settlements.  The island also had many seasonal settlements used by fishermen from Europe.<ref>Drake, p. 115</ref>  These colonists, numbering fewer than 2,000 English and 1,000 French permanent settlers (and many more seasonal visitors), competed with one another for the fisheries of the [[Grand Banks of Newfoundland|Grand Banks]], which were also used by fishermen from Acadia (then encompassing all of present-day [[Nova Scotia]] and [[New Brunswick]]) and Massachusetts.<ref>Pope, pp. 202<U+2013>203<!--population figures--></ref><ref>Drake, p. 115,203</ref>  The border area between [[New France]] and Massachusetts (which then included the [[Province of Maine]]) was also uncertain; there was a French settlement in [[Penobscot Bay]] near the site of modern [[Castine, Maine]] that had already been the site of conflict during the Nine Years' War, and the territory between the Penobscot and [[Kennebec River]]s had been contested in that conflict.<ref>Drake, p. 36</ref> The frontier areas between the [[Saint Lawrence River]] and the primarily coastal settlements of Massachusetts and [[Province of New York|New York]] were still dominated by natives (primarily [[Abenaki]] and [[Iroquois]]), and the [[Hudson River]]<U+2013>[[Lake Champlain]] corridor had also been used for raiding expeditions in both directions in earlier conflicts.  Although the Indian threat had receded somewhat due to reductions in the native population as a result of disease and the last war, they were still seen to pose a potent threat to outlying settlements.<ref>Drake, p. 150</ref>

The Hudson Bay territories (known to the English as [[Prince Rupert's Land]]) were not significantly fought over in this war.    Although they had been a scene of much dispute by competing French and English companies starting in the 1680s, the 1697 [[Treaty of Ryswick]] left France in control of all but one outpost on the bay.  The only incident of note was a [[Battle of Fort Albany (1709)|French attack]] on that outpost, [[Fort Albany, Ontario|Fort Albany]], in 1709.<ref>Newman, pp. 87<!--name of rupert's land-->,109<U+2013>124</ref><ref>Bryce, p. 58</ref>  The [[Hudson's Bay Company]], unhappy that Ryswick had not returned its territories, successfully lobbied for the return of its territories in the negotiations that ended this war.<ref>Newman, pp. 127<U+2013>128</ref>

==Technology and organization==
Military technology used in North America was not as developed as it was in Europe.  Only a few colonial settlements had stone fortifications (among them St. Augustine, Boston, Quebec, and St. John's) at the start of the war, although Port Royal's fortifications were completed early in the war.<ref>Shurtleff, p. 492<!--Boston-->; MacVicar, p. 45<!--Port Royal-->; Arnade, p. 32<!--St. Augustine-->; Prowse, pp. 211<!--Plaisance-->,223<!--St. John's--></ref>  Some frontier villages were protected by wooden [[palisade]]s, but many had little more than fortified wooden houses with [[Embrasure|gun ports]] through which defenders could fire, and overhanging second floors from which they might fire down on attackers trying to break in below.<ref>Leckie, p. 231</ref> Europeans were typically armed with smooth-bore [[musket]]s that had a maximum range of about {{convert|100|yd|m}}, but were inaccurate at ranges beyond half that distance. Some colonists also carried [[pike (weapon)|pike]]s, while Indian warriors were either supplied with European arms, or were armed with more primitive weapons like [[Tomahawk (axe)|tomahawk]]s and [[bows and arrows]].  A small number of colonists had training in the operation of [[cannon]]s and other types of [[artillery]]; these were the only effective weapons for attacking significant stone or wooden defenses.<ref name=Pec26>Peckham, p. 26</ref>

English colonists were generally organized into [[militia]] companies, and their colonies had no regular military presence<ref name=Pec26/> beyond a small number in some of the communities of Newfoundland.<ref name=Prowse223>Prowse, p. 223</ref>  The French colonists were also organized into militias, but they also had a standing defense force called the [[troupes de la marine]]. This force consisted of some experienced officers, and was manned by recruits sent over from France. Numbering between 500 and 1,200, they were spread throughout the territories of New France with concentrations in the major population centers.<ref>Peckham, p. 27</ref>  Spanish Florida was defended by a few hundred regular troops; Spanish policy was to pacify the Indians in their territory and not to provide them with weapons.  This policy had devastating consequences: before the war, Florida held an estimated 8,000 Indians, but this was reduced to 200 after English raids made early in the war.<ref>Wright, p. 65</ref>

==Course of the war==
===Florida and Carolina===
Prominent French and English colonists understood at the turn of the 18th century that control of the Mississippi River would have a significant role in future development and trade, and each developed visionary plans to thwart the other's activities.  The French Canadian explorer [[Pierre Le Moyne d'Iberville]] had, in the aftermath of the last war developed a "Project sur la Caroline" that called for establishing relationships with natives in the Mississippi watershed and then leveraging those relationships to push the English off the continent, or at least limit them to coastal areas.  In pursuit of this grand strategy he rediscovered the mouth of the Mississippi (which had first been found by [[Ren<U+00E9>-Robert Cavelier, Sieur de La Salle|La Salle]] in 1670), and established Fort Maurepas in 1699.  From this base, and [[Fort Louis de la Mobile]] (founded in 1702),<ref>Peckham, p. 58</ref> he began to establish relationships with the local Choctaw, Chickasaw, Natchez, and other tribes.<ref>Waselkov and Hatley, pp. 105<U+2013>137</ref>

[[File:Pierre Le Moyne d'Iberville 1661-1706.jpg|thumb|right|[[Pierre Le Moyne d'Iberville]] was instrumental in French efforts to control the [[Mississippi River]] and trade in the south.]]
English traders and explorers from Carolina had, since its founding in 1670, already established a substantial trading network across the southeastern part of the continent that extended all the way to the Mississippi.<ref>Crane, p. 382</ref>  Its leaders, who had little respect for the Spanish in Florida, understood the threat posed by the French arrival on the coast. Both [[Joseph Blake (governor)|Joseph Blake]], Carolina's governor until his death in 1700, and [[James Moore (South Carolina politician)|James Moore]], who succeeded Blake in 1702, articulated visions of expansion to the south and west at the expense of French and Spanish interests.<ref>Crane, p. 380</ref>

In January 1702, before the war broke out in Europe, Iberville had approached the Spanish with the recommendation that the Apalachee Indians be armed and sent against the English and their allies.  The Spanish organized an expedition under Francisco Romo de Uriza that left Pensacola in August for the trading centers of the Carolina backcountry.  The English, with advance warning of the expedition, organized a defense at the head of the [[Flint River (Georgia)|Flint River]] and [[Battle of Flint River|routed the Spanish-led force]], with upwards of 500 Spanish-led Indians killed or captured.<ref>Oatis, pp. 49<U+2013>50</ref>

When formal notification of hostilities arrived, Governor Moore organized and led a force against Spanish Florida.<ref name=A33>Arnade, p. 33</ref>  In the 1702 [[Siege of St. Augustine (1702)|Siege of St. Augustine]], 500 English soldiers and militia along with 300 Indians captured and burned the town of [[St. Augustine, Florida|St. Augustine]].<ref>Winsor, p. 318</ref>  The English were unable to take the main fortress, and withdrew when a Spanish fleet arrived from [[Havana]].<ref name=A33/>  In 1706 Carolina successfully repulsed [[Charles Town expedition|an attack]] on Charles Town by a combined Spanish and French amphibious force sent from [[Havana, Cuba|Havana]].<ref>Winsor, p. 319</ref>

The [[Apalachee]] and [[Timucua]] of Spanish Florida were virtually wiped out in a raiding expedition by Moore that became known as the [[Apalachee Massacre]] of 1704.<ref>Arnade, pp. 35<U+2013>36</ref>  Many of the survivors of these raids were relocated to the [[Savannah River]], where they were confined to reservations.<ref name=C340/>  Raids consisting of large native forces, sometimes including a small number of white men, continued in the following years,<ref>Arnade, p. 36</ref> including major expeditions directed at [[Siege of Pensacola (1707)|Pensacola]] in 1707 and [[Battle of Mobile (1709)|Mobile]] in 1709.<ref>Crane, p. 390</ref><ref>Higginbotham, pp. 308<U+2013>312<!--Pensacola 1707-->,383<U+2013>385<!--Mobile 1709--></ref>  The [[Muscogee (Creek)]], [[Yamasee]], and [[Chickasaw]], armed and led by Englishmen, dominated these conflicts at the expense of the [[Choctaw]], Timucua, and Apalachee, the latter being somewhat more pacific in nature than the Creek and Chickasaw.<ref name=C340>Covington, p. 340</ref>

===New England and Acadia===
[[File:LieutLewis.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Located in [[Walpole, Massachusetts]], this [[equestrian statue]] depicts Lieutenant Lewis, an [[Officer (armed forces)|officer]] in Queen Anne's War.]]
In 1703, [[Alexandre Leneuf de La Valli<U+00E8>re de Beaubassin]], who commanded a few French Canadians and 500 [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]], led attacks against [[New England]] settlements from [[Wells, Maine|Wells]] to Falmouth (present-day [[Portland, Maine]]).<ref>Peckham, p. 62</ref> They killed or took prisoner more than 160 settlers. In February 1704, [[Jean-Baptiste Hertel de Rouville]] led 250 [[Abenaki]] and [[Mohawk nation|Caughnawaga]] Indians and 50 French Canadians in a [[raid on Deerfield]] in the [[Province of Massachusetts Bay]], and destroyed the settlement, killing and capturing many colonists.  More than 100 captives were taken on an overland journey hundreds of miles north to the [[Kahnawake|Caughnawaga mission village]] near Montreal, where most of the children who survived were adopted by the Mohawk people.  Several adults were later redeemed or released in negotiated prisoner exchanges.<ref name=Pk64>Peckham, p. 64</ref>  Unable to effectively combat these raids, New England colonists retaliated by launching an expedition against [[Acadia]].  Led by the famous Indian fighter [[Benjamin Church (military officer)|Benjamin Church]], the expedition [[Raid on Grand Pre|raided Grand Pre]], [[Isthmus of Chignecto|Chignecto]], and other settlements.<ref name=Pk64/>  Although French accounts claim that Church attempted an attack on Acadia's capital, [[Port Royal, Nova Scotia|Port Royal]], Church's account of the expedition describes a war council in which the expedition decided against making an attack.<ref>Drake, p. 202</ref>

Raiding activity continued in northern Massachusetts in 1705, against which the English colonists were unable to mount an effective defense.  The raids happened too quickly for defensive forces to organize, and reprisal raids usually found Indian camps and settlements empty.  There was a lull in the raiding while the French and English leaders negotiated &mdash;with only limited success &mdash;the exchange of prisoners.<ref>Peckham, p. 65</ref> Raids by Indians, sometimes with French participation, persisted until the end of the war.<ref>See e.g. Drake, pp. 286<U+2013>287</ref>

In May 1707, Massachusetts Governor [[Joseph Dudley]] organized an expedition to take Port Royal. Led by [[John March]], 1,600 men failed to take the fort by [[Siege of Port Royal (1707)|siege]]; a followup expedition in August was also repulsed.<ref>Peckham, p. 67</ref> In response, the French developed an ambitious plan to raid most of the [[Province of New Hampshire|New Hampshire]] settlements on the [[Piscataqua River]].  However, much of the Indian support needed never materialized, and the Massachusetts town of [[Haverhill, Massachusetts|Haverhill]] [[Raid on Haverhill|was raided]] instead.<ref>Drake, pp. 238<U+2013>247</ref>  In 1709, [[Philippe de Rigaud Vaudreuil]], governor of [[New France]], reported that two thirds of the fields north of [[Boston]] were untended due to French and Indian raids.  French-Indian war parties were returning without prisoners because the New England colonists stayed in their forts and would not come out.<ref>Eccles, p. 139</ref>

In September 1710, 3,600 British and colonial forces led by [[Francis Nicholson]] finally [[Siege of Port Royal (1710)|captured Port Royal]] after a siege of one week.  This ended official French control of the [[peninsular]] portion of Acadia (present-day mainland [[Nova Scotia]]),<ref name=Pk71>Peckham, p. 71</ref> although resistance continued until the end of the war.<ref>Parkman (1892), p. 184</ref>

===Expeditions against Quebec===
The French in New France's heartland, [[Canada, New France|Canada]], opposed attacking the [[Province of New York]].  They were reluctant to arouse the [[Iroquois]], who they feared more than they did the British, and with whom they had made the [[Great Peace of Montreal]] in 1701.  New York merchants were opposed to attacking [[New France]], because it would interrupt the lucrative Indian [[fur trade]], much of which came through New France.<ref>Parkman (1892), pp. 8<U+2013>14</ref>  Despite of the efforts of [[Peter Schuyler]], the [[Albany, New York|Albany]] commissioner of Indians, to interest them in the war, the Iroquois maintained their neutrality throughout the conflict.<ref>Parkman (1892), p. 14</ref>

[[Image:WalkerExpeditionMarker.jpg|thumb|right|Detail from a 1733 map with the site of the [[Quebec Expedition|Walker expedition's]] disaster marked in red]]
Francis Nicholson and [[Samuel Vetch]], with some financial and logistical support from the queen, organized an ambitious assault against New France in 1709.  The plan involved an overland assault on [[Montreal]] via Lake Champlain and a sea-based assault by naval forces against [[Quebec City|Quebec]].  The land expedition reached the southern end of Lake Champlain, but was called off when the promised naval support for the attack on Quebec never materialized<ref>Peckham, p. 69</ref> (those forces were diverted to support [[Portugal]]).  The Iroquois had made vague promises of support for this effort, but successfully delayed sending support until it seemed clear the expedition was going to fail.  After this failure,  Nicholson and Schuyler traveled to [[London]] accompanied by [[Hendrick Tejonihokarawa|King Hendrick]] and other [[sachem]]s to arouse interest in the North American frontier war.  The Indian delegation caused a sensation in London, and Queen Anne granted them an audience.  Nicholson and Schuyler were successful in their endeavour<U+2014>the queen gave support for Nicholson's successful capture of Port Royal in 1710.<ref>Peckham, p. 70</ref>  With that success under his belt, Nicholson again returned to England, and gained support for a renewed attempt on Quebec in 1711.<ref name=Pk71/>

The plan for 1711 again called for land and sea-based attacks; its execution was a disaster.  A fleet of 15 [[ships of the line]] and transports carrying 5,000 troops led by Admiral [[Hovenden Walker]] arrived at Boston in June,<ref name=Pk71/> doubling the town's population and greatly straining the colony's ability to provide necessary provisions.<ref>Rodger, p. 129</ref> Sailing for Quebec at the end of July, [[Quebec Expedition|the expedition]] entered the [[Gulf of Saint Lawrence]], and a number of its ships foundered on the rocky shores near the mouth of the Saint Lawrence in the fog.  More than 700 troops were lost, and Walker called the expedition off.<ref>Peckham, p. 72</ref>  In the meantime, Nicholson had [[Nicholson Expedition of 1711|departed for Montreal overland]], but had only reached [[Lake George (New York)|Lake George]] when word of Walker's disaster reached him; he also turned back.<ref>Drake, p. 281</ref> In this expedition, the Iroquois provided several hundred warriors to fight with the English, but they also sent warnings of the expedition to the French.<ref>Eccles, p. 136</ref>

===Newfoundland===
[[Image:Newfoundland1744.jpg|thumb|left|This detail from a 1744 map shows the [[Avalon Peninsula]] of Newfoundland, where most of the conflicts took place.]]
Newfoundland's coast was dotted with small French and English communities, with some fishing stations occupied seasonally by fishermen from Europe.<ref>Prowse, pp. 277<U+2013>280</ref>  Both sides had fortified their principal towns, the French at Plaisance on the western side of the [[Avalon Peninsula]], the English at [[St. John's, Newfoundland and Labrador|St. John's]] on [[Conception Bay]].<ref>Prowse, pp. 223, 276</ref>  During King William's War, d'Iberville had [[Avalon Peninsula Campaign|destroyed most of the English communities]] in 1696<U+2013>7;<ref>Prowse, p. 229</ref> the island again became a battleground in 1702.  In August of that year, an English fleet under the command of Commodore [[John Leake]] [[Newfoundland expedition (1702)|descended on the outlying French communities]] but made no attempts on Plaisance.<ref name=P235>Prowse, p. 235</ref>  During the winter of 1705 [[Daniel d'Auger de Subercase]], the French governor at Plaisance, retaliated, leading a combined French and [[Mi'kmaq people|Mi'kmaq]] expedition that destroyed several English settlements and [[Siege of St. John's|unsuccessfully besieged Fort William at St. John's]].  The French and their Indian allies continued to harry the English throughout the summer, and did damages claimed at <U+00A3>188,000 to the English establishments.<ref>Prowse, pp. 242<U+2013>246</ref>  The English sent a fleet in 1706 that destroyed French fishing outposts on the island's northern coasts.<ref>Prowse, pp. 246<U+2013>248</ref>  In December 1708 a combined force of French, Canadian, and Mi'kmaq volunteers [[Battle of St. John's|captured St. John's]], and destroyed the fortifications.  Lacking the resources to hold the prize, they abandoned it, and St. John's was reoccupied and refortified by the English in 1709.  (The same French expedition also tried to take [[Ferryland, Newfoundland and Labrador|Ferryland]], but it successfully resisted.)<ref>Prowse, p. 249</ref>

English fleet commanders contemplated, but did not make, attacks on Plaisance in 1703 and 1711 (the latter by Admiral Walker in the aftermath of the disaster at the mouth of the St. Lawrence).<ref>Prowse, pp. 235<U+2013>236</ref>

===Peace===
In 1712, Britain and France declared an armistice, and a final peace agreement was signed the following year.  Under terms of the 1713 [[Treaty of Utrecht (1713)|Treaty of Utrecht]], Britain gained Acadia (which they renamed [[Nova Scotia]]), sovereignty over [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]], the [[Hudson Bay]] region, and the [[Caribbean]] island of [[St. Kitts]].  France recognized British [[suzerainty]] over the Iroquois,<ref name=Pk74/> and agreed that commerce with Native Americans further inland would be open to all nations.<ref>Marshall, p. 1155</ref>  It retained all of the islands in the Gulf of Saint Lawrence, including [[Cape Breton Island]], and retained fishing rights in the area, including rights to dry fish on the [[French Shore|northern shore]] of Newfoundland.<ref>Prowse, p. 258</ref>

==Consequences==
===Southern colonies===
[[File:QueenAnnesWarAfter.svg|thumb|right|400px|European territorial control after the war]]
Spanish Florida never really recovered its economy or population due to the effects of the war,<ref>Weber, pp. 144<U+2013>145</ref> and was ceded to Britain following the Seven Years' War in the [[Treaty of Paris (1763)|1763 Treaty of Paris]].<ref>Weber, p. 199</ref>  Indians that had been resettled along the Atlantic coast chafed under British rule, as did those allied to the British in this war.  This discontent flared into the 1715 [[Yamasee War]] that posed a major threat to South Carolina's viability.<ref>Weber, p. 166</ref>  The loss of population in the Spanish territories contributed to the 1732 founding of the [[Province of Georgia]], which was, like Carolina, granted on territory Spain had originally claimed.<ref>Weber, p. 180</ref>  Following military action by James Moore against the [[Tuscarora (tribe)|Tuscarora]]s of North Carolina (part of the [[Tuscarora War]] begun in 1711), many of them fled north as refugees to join their linguistic cousins, the Iroquois.<ref name=Pk75>Peckham, p. 75</ref>

The economic costs of the war were high in some of the southern English colonies, including those that saw little military activity.  Virginia, Maryland, and Pennsylvania to a lesser extent, were hit hard by the cost of shipping their export products (primarily [[tobacco]]) to European markets, and also suffered because of several particularly bad harvests.<ref>Craven, pp. 301<U+2013>302</ref>  South Carolina accumulated a significant debt burden to finance military operations.<ref name=Craven307_9/>

===New England===
Although Massachusetts and New Hampshire were on the front line of the war, the New England colonies suffered less economic damage than other areas.  The importance of [[Boston]] as a center of shipbuilding and trade, combined with a financial windfall caused by the crown's military spending on the 1711 Quebec expedition, offset some of the costs of waging the war.<ref name=Craven307_9>Craven, pp. 307<U+2013>309</ref>

===Newfoundland and Acadia===
The loss of Newfoundland and Acadia restricted the French presence on the Atlantic to Cape Breton Island.  French settlers from Newfoundland were resettled there, creating the colony of <U+00CE>le-Royale, and France constructed the [[Fortress of Louisbourg]] in the following years.<ref name=Pk74>Peckham, p. 74</ref>  This presence, combined with the rights to use the Newfoundland shore, resulted in continued friction between French and British fishing interests, which was not fully resolved until late in the 18th century.<ref>Prowse, p. 282</ref>  The economic effects of the war were severe in Newfoundland, with the fishing fleets plying its waters significantly reduced.<ref>Prowse, p. 251</ref>  The British fishing fleet began to recover immediately after the peace was finalized.<ref>Prowse, p. 274</ref>  The British attempted to prevent Spanish ships from fishing in Newfoundland waters, as they previously had.  However, many Spanish ships were simply reflagged with English [[straw owner]]s to evade British controls.<ref>Prowse, p. 277</ref>

The British capture of Acadia had long-term consequences for the Acadians and Mi'kmaq living there.  Britain's hold on Nova Scotia was initially quite tenuous, a situation that French and Mi'kmaq resistance leaders capitalized on.<ref>Plank, pp. 57<U+2013>61</ref>  British relations with the Mi'kmaq after the war developed in the context of British expansion not just in Nova Scotia,<ref>Griffiths, p. 286</ref> but also along the Maine coast, where New Englanders began moving into Abenaki lands, often in violation of previous treaties.  Since neither the Abenakis nor the Mi'kmaq were recognized in the Treaty of Utrecht,  the Mi'kmaq and Abenakis resisted these incursions into their lands.  This conflict, abetted by French intriguers like [[S<U+00E9>bastien Rale]], developed into [[Dummer's War]] (1722<U+2013>1727).<ref>Plank, pp. 71<U+2013>79</ref>

British relations with the nominally conquered Acadians were also difficult.  Repeated British demands that Acadians swear oaths to the British crown were resisted, and eventually sparked [[Acadian Exodus|an exodus]] by the Acadians to <U+00CE>le-Royale and <U+00CE>le-Saint-Jean (present-day [[Prince Edward Island]]).<ref>Griffiths, pp. 267<U+2013>281, 393</ref>  By the 1740s French leaders like Father [[Jean-Louis Le Loutre]] orchestrated [[Father Le Loutre's War|a guerrilla war]] with their Mi'kmaq allies against British attempts to expand Protestant settlements in peninsular Nova Scotia.<ref>Griffiths, pp. 390<U+2013>393</ref>

Friction also persisted between France and Britain over Acadia's borders.  The treaty was vague about describing its boundaries, which even the French had never really formally described.  France insisted that only the Acadian peninsula (modern Nova Scotia except Cape Breton Island) was included in the treaty, and that they retained the rights to modern [[New Brunswick]].<ref>Peckham, p. 84</ref>  The disputes over Acadia, which flared into open conflict during [[King George's War]] in the 1740s, would not be resolved until the British conquest of all French North American territories in the area in the [[Seven Years' War]].<ref>See e.g. Parkman (1897) for the later history of British-Acadian conflict.</ref>

===Trade===
The French did not fully comply with the commerce provisions of the Treaty of Utrecht.  They attempted to prevent English trade with remote Indian tribes, and erected [[Fort Niagara]] in Iroquois territory.  French settlements on the Gulf Coast continued to grow, with the settlement of [[New Orleans]] in 1718, and other attempts, ultimately unsuccessful, to expand into Spanish-controlled Texas and Florida.  French trading networks penetrated the continent along the waterways feeding the Gulf of Mexico,<ref>Weber, p. 184</ref> renewing conflicts with both the British and the Spanish.<ref>Peckham, p. 82</ref> Trading networks established in the Mississippi River watershed, including the [[Ohio River]] valley, also brought the French into more contact with British trading networks and colonial settlements that crossed the Appalachian Mountains.  Conflicting claims over that territory eventually led to war in 1754, when the [[French and Indian War]] broke out.<ref>Parkman (1897), pp. 133<U+2013>150</ref>
