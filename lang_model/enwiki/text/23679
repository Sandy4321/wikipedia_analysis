'''Welf pudding''' or '''Guelph pudding''' ({{lang-de|Welfenspeise}}) is a two-layered [[pudding]] from Germany. The white bottom layer is made from a cooked [[milk]] and [[vanilla]] [[sauce]] on a base of very stiffly whipped egg-white. After being chilled it is then covered with a yellow layer of wine sauce made of beaten [[egg yolk]], [[white wine]] and a little [[lemon juice]].

Welf pudding gets its name from the colours of the [[House of Welf]] (also known as the House of Guelph), a German aristocratic family that ruled the [[Principality of L<U+00FC>neburg]] in [[medieval]] times. The pudding is a culinary speciality from [[Lower Saxony]] in north Germany. It was created by a Hanoverian chef and served for the first time at the 200th anniversary of the rule of the House of Welf. It is said that it became the favourite [[dessert]] of [[Ernest Augustus, Elector of Hanover]].
