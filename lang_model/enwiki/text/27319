'''C<U+00F4>te d'Ivoire''' ([[International Phonetic Alphabet|pronounced]] {{IPA|/kot divwa<U+0280>/}} in International [[French language|French]]; officially the '''R<U+00E9>publique de C<U+00F4>te d'Ivoire'''), or, translated into English, the '''Ivory Coast''',<ref>See [[#Name]] above.</ref> is a country in [[West Africa]]. It borders [[Liberia]] and [[Guinea]] to the west, [[Mali]] and [[Burkina Faso]] to the north, [[Ghana]] to the east, and the [[Gulf of Guinea]] to the south.

The country's early history is virtually unknown, although a [[Neolithic]] culture is thought to have existed.  In the [[19th century]] it was invaded by two [[Akan people|Akan]] groups. In [[1843]]-[[1844]], a treaty made it a [[protectorate]] of [[France]] and in [[1893]] C<U+00F4>te d'Ivoire became a French colony. The country became independent in [[1960]]. Until [[1993]] it was led by [[F<U+00E9>lix Houphou<U+00EB>t-Boigny]] and was closely associated economically and politically with its West African neighbors, for example forming the [[Council of the Entente]]. At the same time the country maintained close ties to the [[West]], which helped its economic development and political stability. Since the end of Houpho<U+00EB>t-Boigny's rule, this stability has been destroyed by two [[coup]]s ([[1999]] and [[2001]]) and a [[Ivorian Civil War|civil war]] since [[2002]], which has hampered its economic development.<ref name=state.gov>[http://www.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/2846.htm Background Note: Cote d'Ivoire] in state.gov. Accessed January 1, 2007.</ref>

C<U+00F4>te d'Ivoire is a republic with a strong executive power personified in the [[President of C<U+00F4>te d'Ivoire|President]]. Its ''[[de jure]]'' capital is [[Yamoussoukro]] and the [[official language]] is [[French language|French]]. The country is divided into [[Regions of C<U+00F4>te d'Ivoire|19 regions]] and [[Departments of C<U+00F4>te d'Ivoire|58 departments]]. C<U+00F4>te d'Ivoire's economy is largely market-based and relies heavily on [[agriculture]], with smallholder cash crop production being dominant. For a developing country, it has an excellent [[infrastructure]].<ref name=CIA/>

== History ==
{{main|History of C<U+00F4>te d'Ivoire}}
Little is known about C<U+00F4>te d'Ivoire before the arrival of [[Portugal|Portuguese]] [[ships]] in the 1460s.  The major [[ethnic group]]s came relatively recently from neighbouring areas: the [[Kru]] people from [[Liberia]] around 1600; the [[Senoufo]] and [[Lobi]] moved southward from [[Burkina Faso]] and [[Mali]].  In the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries the [[Akan (ethnic group)|Akan]] people, including the [[Baoul<U+00E9>]], migrated from [[Ghana]] into the eastern area of the country, and the [[Malink<U+00E9>]] from [[Guinea]] into the north-west.

===French colonial era===
Compared to neighbouring Ghana, C<U+00F4>te d'Ivoire suffered little from the [[slave trade]].  European slaving and merchant ships preferred other areas along the coast, with better harbours.  France took an interest in the 1840s, enticing local chiefs to grant French commercial traders a monopoly along the coast.  Thereafter, the French built naval bases to keep out non-French traders and began a systematic conquest of the interior.  They accomplished this only after a long war in the 1890s against [[Mandinka people|Mandinka]] forces, mostly from Gambia.  [[Guerrilla warfare]] by the Baoul<U+00E9> and other eastern groups continued until 1917.

France's main goal was to stimulate the production of [[export]]s.  [[Coffee]], [[cocoa]] and [[palm oil]] crops were soon planted along the coast.  C<U+00F4>te d'Ivoire stood out as the only West African country with a sizeable population of 'settlers'; elsewhere in West and Central Africa, the French and [[English people|English]] were largely bureaucrats.  As a result, a third of the [[cocoa]], [[coffee]] and [[banana]] [[plantation]]s were in the hands of French citizens and a forced-labour system became the backbone of the [[economy]].

===Independence===
The son of a Baoul<U+00E9> chief, [[F<U+00E9>lix Houphou<U+00EB>t-Boigny]], was to become C<U+00F4>te d'Ivoire's father of independence.  In [[1944]] he formed the country's first agricultural [[trade union]] for African cocoa farmers like himself. Annoyed that colonial policy favoured French plantation owners, they united to recruit migrant workers for their own farms. Houphou<U+00EB>t-Boigny soon rose to prominence and within a year was elected to the French Parliament in [[Paris]]. A year later the French abolished forced labour.  Houphou<U+00EB>t-Boigny established a strong relationship with the French government, expressing a belief that the country would benefit from it, which it did for many years.  France made him the first African to become a minister in a European government.

In 1958, C<U+00F4>te d'Ivoire became an autonomous member of the French Community (which replaced the French Union).

At the time of C<U+00F4>te d'Ivoire's independence ([[1960]]), the country was easily [[French West Africa]]'s most prosperous, contributing over 40% of the region's total exports.  When Houphou<U+00EB>t-Boigny became the first president, his government gave farmers good prices for their products to further stimulate production.  Coffee production increased significantly, catapulting C<U+00F4>te d'Ivoire into third place in world output (behind [[Brazil]] and [[Colombia]]). By [[1979]] the country was the world's leading producer of cocoa. It also became Africa's leading exporter of [[pineapples]] and [[palm oil]]. French technicians contributed to the 'Ivoirian miracle'. In the rest of Africa, Europeans were driven out following independence; but in C<U+00F4>te d'Ivoire, they poured in. The French community grew from only 10,000 prior to independence to 50,000, most of them [[teachers]] and advisors. For 20 years, the economy maintained an annual growth rate of nearly 10% - the highest of Africa's non-oil-exporting countries.

===Houphou<U+00EB>t-Boigny administration===
Politically, Houphou<U+00EB>t-Boigny ruled with a firmness some called an "iron hand"; others characterized his rule more mildly as "paternal."  The press was not free and only one political party existed<!--some would say this was evidence of the presidents will--> although some accepted this as a consequence of Houphou<U+00EB>t-Boigny's broad appeal to the population that continually elected him. He was also criticized for his emphasis on developing large scale projects. Many felt the millions of dollars spent transforming his home village, [[Yamoussoukro]], into the new capital that it became, were wasted; others support his vision to develop a center for peace, education and religion in the heart of the country. But in the early 1980s, the world recession and a local drought sent shockwaves through the Ivoirian economy. Thanks also to the overcutting of [[timber]] and collapsing [[sugar]] prices, the country's external debt increased threefold. Crime rose dramatically in Abidjan. 

In 1990, hundreds of civil servants went on strike, joined by students protesting institutional corruption.  The unrest forced the government to support multi-party democracy.  Houphou<U+00EB>t-Boigny became increasingly feeble and died in 1993. He favoured [[Henri Konan B<U+00E9>di<U+00E9>]] as his successor.

===B<U+00E9>di<U+00E9> administration===
In October 1995, B<U+00E9>di<U+00E9> overwhelmingly won re-election against a fragmented and disorganised opposition. He tightened his hold over political life, jailing several hundred opposition supporters.  In contrast, the economic outlook improved, at least superficially, with decreasing inflation and an attempt to remove foreign debt.

Unlike Houphou<U+00EB>t-Boigny, who was very careful in avoiding any ethnic conflict and left access to administrative positions wide-open to immigrants from neighbouring countries, Bedi<U+00E9> emphasized the concept of "Ivority" (''[[Ivoirit<U+00E9>]]'') to exclude his rival [[Alassane Ouattara]], who had only one parent of Ivory Coast nationality, from running for future presidential election.  As people originating from [[Burkina Faso]] are a large part of the Ivoirian population, this policy excluded many people from Ivoirian nationality, and the relationship between various ethnic groups became strained.

===1999 coup===
Similarly, B<U+00E9>di<U+00E9> excluded many potential opponents from the army. In late 1999, a group of dissatisfied officers staged a military coup, putting General [[Robert Gu<U+00E9><U+00EF>]] in power.  B<U+00E9>di<U+00E9> fled into exile in France. The coup had reduced crime and corruption, and the generals pressed for austerity and openly campaigned in the streets for a less wasteful society.

===Gbagbo administration===
A presidential election was held in October 2000 in which [[Laurent Gbagbo]] vied with Gu<U+00E9><U+00EF>, but it was neither peaceful nor democratic.  The lead-up to the election was marked by military and civil unrest.  Gu<U+00E9><U+00EF>'s attempt to rig the election led to a public uprising, resulting in around 180 deaths and his swift replacement by the election's likely winner, Gbagbo.  [[Alassane Ouattara]] was disqualified by the country's Supreme Court, due to his alleged Burkinab<U+00E9> nationality. The existing and later reformed constitution did not allow non-citizens to run for president. This sparked violent protests in which his supporters, mainly from the country's [[Muslim]] north, battled riot police in the capital, Yamoussoukro.

===2002 mutiny===
In the early hours of [[September 19]], [[2002]], there was an attempted assassination of the president. Troops who were to be demobilised mutinied, launching attacks in several cities.  By lunchtime the French interjected to assist the government; it is disputed as to whether their interjection into the situation helped or hindered the situation - but by the end of the day, they had lost control of the north of the country, which is still divided from the south today.  The fight for the south had also been tough. The battle for the main gendarmerie barracks in Abidjan lasted until mid-morning. What exactly happened that night is disputed.  The government said that former president Robert Gu<U+00E9><U+00EF> had led a coup attempt, and state TV showed pictures of his dead body in the street; counter-claims said that he and fifteen others had been murdered at his home and his body had been moved to the streets to incriminate him. Alassane Ouattara took refuge in the French embassy, his home burned down.

President Gbagbo cut short a foreign trip to [[Italy]], and on his return, stated that some of the rebels were hiding in the shanty towns where foreign migrant workers live. Gendarmes and vigilantes bulldozed and burned homes by the thousands, attacking the residents.

An early ceasefire with the rebels, who had the backing of the northern populace, proved short-lived, and fighting over the prime cocoa-growing areas resumed.  [http://www.kepi.cncplusplus.com/Ivory_Coast/Ivory_Coast.htm France sent in troops] to maintain the cease-fire boundaries, and militias, including warlords and fighters from [[Liberia]] and [[Sierra Leone]], took advantage of the crisis to seize parts of the west.

===2003 unity government===
In January 2003, President Gbagbo and rebel leaders signed accords creating a "government of national unity". Curfews were lifted and French troops cleaned up the lawless western border of the country.  But the central problems remained, and neither side achieved its goals.

Since then, the unity government has proven extremely unstable. In March 2004, 120 people were killed in an opposition rally. A later report concluded the killings were planned. Though UN peacekeepers were deployed, relations between Gbagbo and the opposition continued to deteriorate.

== Politics ==
{{main|Politics of C<U+00F4>te d'Ivoire}}<!--Please add new information into relevant articles of the series-->
Since 1983, C<U+00F4>te d'Ivoire's official capital has been [[Yamoussoukro]]; [[Abidjan]], however, remains the administrative center.  Most countries maintain their embassies in Abidjan, although some (including the United Kingdom) have closed their missions because of the continuing violence and attacks on Europeans. The aforementioned population continues to suffer because of an ongoing civil war (''See the History section above''). International human rights organizations have noted problems with the treatment of captive non-combatants by both sides and the re-emergence of child slavery among workers in cocoa production.

Although most of the fighting ended by late 2004, the country remained split in two, with the north controlled by the ''New Forces'' (FN). A new presidential election was expected to be held in October 2005. However, this election could not be held on time due to delay in preparation and was postponed first to October 2006, and then to October 2007 after an agreement was reached among the rival parties.

[[Image:C<U+00F4>te d'Ivoire Map.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Map Of C<U+00F4>te d'Ivoire]]
C<U+00F4>te d'Ivoire is a country of western [[sub-Saharan Africa]]. It borders [[Liberia]] and [[Guinea]] in the west, [[Mali]] and [[Burkina Faso]] in the north, [[Ghana]] in the east, and the [[Gulf of Guinea]] ([[Atlantic Ocean]]) in the south.

== Economy ==
{{main|Economy of C<U+00F4>te d'Ivoire}}
Maintaining  close ties to France since independence in 1960, diversification of agriculture for export, and encouragement of foreign investment, has made C<U+00F4>te d'Ivoire one of the most prosperous of the tropical African states. However, in recent years C<U+00F4>te d'Ivoire has been subject to greater competition and falling prices in the global marketplace for its primary agricultural crops: [[coffee]] and [[cocoa]]. That, compounded with high internal corruption, makes life difficult for the grower and those exporting into foreign markets.

== Demographics ==
{{main|Demographics of C<U+00F4>te d'Ivoire}}
77% of the population are considered Ivorians. They represent several different people and language groups. An estimated 65 languages are spoken in the country. One of the most common is Dyula, which acts as a trade language as well as a language commonly spoken by the Muslim population. [[French language|French]], the official language, is taught in schools and serves as a [[lingua franca]] in urban areas (particularly Abidjan).
Since Cote d'Ivoire has established itself as one of the most successful West African nations, about 20% of the population consists of workers from neighbouring Liberia, Burkina Faso and Guinea. This fact has created steadily increasing tension in recent years, especially since most of these workers are [[Muslims]] while the native-born population is largely [[Christian]] (primarily [[Catholic Church in C<U+00F4>te d'Ivoire|Roman Catholic]]) and [[animist]]. 4% of the population is of non-African ancestry.  Many are [[France|French]] and [[Spain|Spanish]] citizens, as well as Protestant missionaries from the United States and Canada. In November 2004, around 10,000 French and other foreign nationals evacuated C<U+00F4>te d'Ivoire due to attacks from pro-government youth militias.

In October 1985 the government requested that the country be known as '''C<U+00F4>te d'Ivoire''' in every language, without a hyphen between the two words (thereby contravening the standard rule in French that geographical names with several words must be written with hyphens).

===Usage===
Despite the Ivorian government's ruling, "Ivory Coast" (sometimes "the Ivory Coast") is still sometimes used in English:
*[[BBC]] usually uses "Ivory Coast" both in news reports and on its page about the country [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/country_profiles/1043014.stm], 
*''[[The Guardian]]'' newspaper's Style Guide says: "Ivory Coast, not 'the Ivory Coast' or 'C<U+00F4>te D'Ivoire'; its nationals are Ivorians"[http://www.guardian.co.uk/styleguide/page/0,5817,184827,00.html],
*[[ABC News]], ''[[The Times]]'', the ''[[New York Times]]'', and the [[South African Broadcasting Corporation]] all use "Ivory Coast" either exclusively or predominantly.

Governments use "C<U+00F4>te d'Ivoire" for diplomatic reasons. The English country name registered with the [[United Nations member states|United Nations]] and adopted by [[ISO 3166]] is "C<U+00F4>te d'Ivoire". English-speaking people in neighboring [[Liberia]] and [[Ghana]] both use "Cote d'Ivoire" in preference to "Ivory Coast". Other organizations that use "C<U+00F4>te d'Ivoire" include:
*the [[United States Department of State]] uses "C<U+00F4>te d'Ivoire" in formal documents, but uses "Ivory Coast" in many general references, speeches and briefing documents [http://www.state.gov/p/af/rls/rm/2005/43552.htm],
*[[FIFA]] and the [[International Olympic Committee|IOC]], referring to their [[C<U+00F4>te d'Ivoire national football team|national football]] and [[Olympic Games|Olympic]] teams in international games and in official broadcasts, 
*''[[The Economist]]'' newsmagazine [http://www.economist.com/research/styleGuide/index.cfm?page=805717],
*''[[Encyclop<U+00E6>dia Britannica]]'', and
*''[[National Geographic Society]]'' [http://www3.nationalgeographic.com/places/directory.html].
