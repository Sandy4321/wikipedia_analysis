The '''Boulton and Watt steam engine''' preserved in the [[Powerhouse Museum]] in [[Sydney]], Australia, built in 1785, is one of the first rotative [[steam engine]]s ever built, and is the oldest surviving.<ref name="travel"/><ref>{{cite book|title=Historical dictionary of Sydney|first=Arthur|last=Emerson|publisher=Scarecrow Press |year=2001 |page=294 |isbn=0-8108-3999-7}}</ref> A [[rotative beam engine|rotative engine]] is a type of [[beam engine]] where the [[reciprocating motion]] of the beam is converted to [[rotation around a fixed axis|rotary motion]], producing a continuous power source suitable for driving machinery.

This engine was designed by the mechanical engineer [[James Watt]], manufactured for the firm [[Boulton and Watt]] and originally installed in a [[brewery]] in London. On decommissioning in 1887 it was sent to Australia's Powerhouse Museum (then known as the [[Technological, Industrial and Sanitary Museum]]) and has since been restored to full working order.

== History ==
The engine was ordered by [[Samuel Whitbread (brewer)|Samuel Whitbread]] in 1784 to replace a [[Horse mill|horse wheel]] at the [[Chiswell Street]] premises of his [[Whitbread|London brewery]]. It was installed in 1785, the second steam engine to be installed in a brewery,<ref>{{cite book|title=London and the Thames Valley|page=232|first=Denis|last=Smith|publisher=Thomas Telford|year=2001|isbn=0-7277-2876-8}}</ref> and enabled Whitbread to become the largest brewer in Britain.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/BUwhitbread.htm|title=Samuel Whitbread|publisher=Spartacus Educational|accessdate=20 March 2009}}</ref> The horse wheel was retained for many years, serving as a backup in case the steam engine broke down.<ref name=phdatabase />

The [[drive gear]] of the engine, still evident today, was connected to a series of wooden [[line shaft]]s which drove machinery within the [[brewery]]. Connected machinery included rollers to crush [[malt]]; an [[Archimedes' screw]], that lifted the crushed malt into a [[Chute (gravity)|hopper]]; a [[hoist (device)|hoist]], for lifting items into the building; a three-piston [[pump]], for pumping beer; and a stirrer within a vat. There was also a reciprocating pump connected to the engine's beam, used to pump water from a [[Water well|well]] to a tank on the roof of the brewery.<ref name=phdatabase /><ref name=powerhouse>{{cite web|url=http://www.powerhousemuseum.com/exhibitions/boulton&watt.asp|title=The Boulton and Watt engine <U+2013> Powerhouse Museum description|accessdate=13 March 2009}}</ref>

In a marketing coup for both the brewer and the engine's manufacturer, [[George III of the United Kingdom|King George III]] and [[Charlotte of Mecklenburg-Strelitz|Queen Charlotte]] visited the brewery on 24 May 1787.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.londontourist.org/city%20walk%20one.html|title=The City Walk 1: Diamonds to Dungeons|publisher=The London Guide|accessdate=20 March 2009}}</ref> The engine remained in service for 102 years, until 1887.

The engine made its way to the Powerhouse Museum (then known as the Technological, Industrial and Sanitary Museum) through [[Archibald Liversidge]], an English-born chemist, scientist and academic at the University of Sydney, who was a trustee of the Museum.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.adb.online.anu.edu.au/biogs/A050110b.htm|title=Liversidge, Archibald (1846<U+2013>1927)|publisher=Australian Dictionary of Biography|accessdate=13 March 2009}}</ref> Liversidge was in London in 1887, at the time of the engine's decommissioning, and when he heard that the engine was to be scrapped he asked whether it could be donated to the museum.<ref>{{cite book|title=Robotics|first=Joseph A.|last=Angelo|page=389|publisher=Libraries Unlimited|year=2007|isbn=1-57356-337-4}}</ref> Whitbread & Co agreed on condition that the engine be set up and used for educational purposes.<ref name=phdatabase>{{cite web|url=http://www.powerhousemuseum.com/collection/database/?irn=7177|title=Object: Boulton and Watt steam engine, 1785|work=Powerhouse Museum Collection Search 2.4|publisher=Powerhouse Museum|accessdate=19 March 2009}}</ref>

Subsequently the engine was dismantled and shipped to Sydney on the sailing ship ''Patriarch''. For shipping purposes, the large flywheel was divided into two halves. While the flywheel's rim could be unbolted, the hub with attached spokes had to be drilled though and rejoined after shipping. A shortage of funds meant the engine was kept in storage for several years. Eventually the engine was erected in its own engine house, behind the main building at the museum's old Harris Street premises. During the 1920s or 1930s, an electric motor was added so that people could see the engine in motion. During the 1980s the Technology Restoration Society was formed in order to raise funds for the engine's restoration. Restoration took place at the Museum's Castle Hill site. During the restoration, some parts - including the piston - were replaced to preserve the original parts.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.powerhousemuseum.com/exhibitions/boulton&watt_teachers.php|title=Boulton and Watt engine - For Teachers|publisher=Powerhouse Museum|accessdate=21 December 2013}}</ref><ref>"A dynamic object", "The 'original' piston", Information displayed at the Powerhouse Museum, 4 December 2013</ref> The engine, restored to steaming condition, was installed in the new Powerhouse Museum in 1988.<ref name=phdatabase /> Today the engine is sometimes operated as part of the Museum's Steam Revolution exhibition,<ref name="travel">{{cite book|title=Travellers in Time |first=George |last=Gunton |page=85|publisher=Oceans Enterprises|year=1996|isbn=0-9586657-0-2}}</ref> steam being provided by the Museum's central [[boiler]].

[[File:Sun and planet gears.gif|right|thumb|200px|The Powerhouse Museum's Boulton and Watt steam engine makes use of a [[sun and planet gear]], a mechanism that converts vertical motion to rotary motion.]]
The engine has a {{convert|0.64|m|in}} diameter [[piston]] with a {{convert|1.8|m|ft|sigfig=1}} long [[Stroke (engine)|stroke]], driven by a [[mean effective pressure]] of {{convert|70|kPa|psi|sigfig=1}}. Its top speed is 20 [[revolutions per minute]] (rpm) of the flywheel.

Apart from its age, the engine is notable in that it embodies the four innovations which made Boulton & Watt's engines a significant driver of the [[Industrial Revolution]]. The first is a [[Watt steam engine#Separate condenser|separate condenser]], which increases the efficiency of the engine by allowing the main cylinder to remain hot at all times. The second is the [[parallel motion]], which converts the up-and-down motion of the piston into the arcing motion of the beam, whilst maintaining a rigid connection. The rigid connection allowed the engine to be double-acting, meaning the piston could push as well as pull the beam. Third is the [[centrifugal governor]], used to automatically regulate the speed of the engine. Finally the [[sun and planet gear]] convert the reciprocating motion of the beam into a rotating motion, which can be used to drive rotating machinery.<ref>{{cite web|first=Debbie|last=Rudder|url=http://www.powerhousemuseum.com/exhibitions/boulton&watt_transcript.asp|title=Transcript <U+2013> Boulton and Watt|publisher=Powerhouse Museum|accessdate=19 March 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=Energy and society|first=Harold H.|last=Schobert|page=121|publisher=Taylor & Francis|year=2002|isbn=1-56032-767-7}}</ref>
