They set up an empire known as [[Great Seljuq Empire]] that stretched from [[Anatolia]] to [[Punjab region|Punjab]] and was the target of the [[First Crusade]]. The dynasty had its origins in the [[Oghuz Turks|Turcoman]] tribal confederations of Central Asia and marked the beginning of [[Turkic peoples|Turkic]] power in the [[Middle East]]. Today they are regarded as the cultural ancestors of the Western Turks - the present-day inhabitants of [[Azerbaijan]], [[Turkey]], and [[Turkmenistan]] - and they are remembered as great patrons of [[Persian culture]], [[Persian art|art]], [[Persian literature|literature]], and [[Persian language|language]].<ref name="iranica">O.<U+00D6>zg<U+00FC>ndenli, ''"Persian Manuscripts in Ottoman and Modern Turkish Libraries"'', [[Encyclopaedia Iranica]], Online Edition, ([http://www.iranica.com/newsite/articles/ot_grp7/ot_pers_mss_ott_20050106.html LINK])</ref><ref name="britannica">[[Encyclopaedia Britannica]], ''"Seljuq"'', Online Edition, ([http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9066688 LINK]): ''"...
