'''''Deliverance''''' is a 1972 American [[Drama film|dramatic]] [[Thriller (genre)|thriller film]] produced and directed by [[John Boorman]] and starring [[Jon Voight]], [[Burt Reynolds]], [[Ned Beatty]], and [[Ronny Cox]], with the latter two making their feature film debuts. The film is based on the [[1970 in literature|1970]] [[Deliverance (novel)|novel of the same name]] by American author [[James Dickey]], who has a small role in the film as the [[Sheriffs in the United States|Sheriff]]. The screenplay was written by Dickey and an uncredited Boorman.

Widely acclaimed as a landmark picture, the film is noted both for the memorable music scene near the beginning, with one of the city men duelling on guitar with a strange country boy playing banjo, that sets the tone for what lies ahead<U+2014>a trip into unknown and potentially dangerous wilderness<U+2014>and for its notorious [[male rape]] scene. In 2008, ''Deliverance'' was selected for preservation in the United States [[National Film Registry]] by the [[Library of Congress]] as being "culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant".

==Plot==
Four [[Atlanta]] businessmen, Lewis Medlock ([[Burt Reynolds]]), Ed Gentry ([[Jon Voight]]), Bobby Trippe ([[Ned Beatty]]), and Drew Ballinger ([[Ronny Cox]]), decide to canoe down a river in the remote northern Georgia wilderness, expecting to have fun and see the glory of nature before the fictional [[Cahulawassee River]] valley is flooded by construction of a dam. Lewis, an experienced outdoorsman, is the leader. Ed is also a veteran of several trips but lacks Lewis' machismo. Bobby and Drew are novices.

Traveling in pairs, the foursome's two canoes are briefly separated. The occupants of one canoe (Bobby and Ed) encounter a pair of grizzled [[mountain men]] emerging from woods, one wielding a shotgun. Bobby is forced at gunpoint to strip naked, his ear twisted to bring him to his hands and knees, and then ordered to "squeal like a [[pig]]" before being [[rape|raped]] while Ed is bound to a tree and held at gunpoint by the other man.

Hearing the commotion, Lewis secretly sneaks up, and kills the rapist with an arrow from his [[recurve bow]]; meanwhile the other mountain man quickly escapes into the woods. After a brief but hotheaded debate between Lewis and Drew about whether to inform the authorities, the men vote to side with Lewis' recommendation to bury the dead mountain man's body and continue on as if nothing had happened <U+2014> since Lewis said that they wouldn't receive a fair trial, as the local [[jury]] would be composed of the dead man's friends and relatives; likewise, Bobby doesn't want what had happened to him to be known. The four continue downriver but soon disaster strikes as the canoes reach a dangerous stretch of [[rapids]]. As Drew and Ed reach the rapids in the lead canoe, Drew clutches his head and falls forward into the river. The reason for Drew's fall is left unclear.   

After Drew's fall into the river, the survivors' canoes collide on the rocks, spilling Lewis, Bobby and Ed into the river. Lewis breaks his [[femur]] and the others are washed ashore alongside him. Encouraged by the badly-injured Lewis, who believes they are being stalked by the other mountain man, Ed climbs a nearby rock face in order to dispatch the other mountain man using his bow while Bobby stays behind to look after Lewis. Ed reaches the top and hides out until the next morning, when the other mountain man appears on the top of the cliff with a rifle, looking down into the gorge where Lewis and Bobby are located. Ed clumsily shoots and manages to kill him, accidentally stabbing himself with one of his own spare arrows in the process. Ed and Bobby weigh down the mountain man's body in the river to ensure it will never be found, and repeat the same with Drew's body which they encounter downriver. Upon finally reaching Aintry, they take the injured Lewis to the hospital. The men carefully concoct a cover story for the authorities about Drew's death and disappearance being an accident, lying about their ordeal to Sheriff Bullard in order to escape a possible double murder charge. The sheriff clearly doesn't believe them, but has no evidence and simply tells the men never to come back. They readily agree. The trio vow to keep their story of death and survival a secret for the rest of their lives. In the final scene, Ed awakes, startled by a nightmare in which a man's hand rises from the lake.

==Production==
''Deliverance'' was shot primarily in [[Rabun County, Georgia|Rabun County]] in northeastern Georgia. The canoe scenes were filmed in the [[Tallulah Gorge]] southeast of [[Clayton, Georgia|Clayton]] and on the [[Chattooga River]]. This river divides the northeastern corner of [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] from the northwestern corner of [[South Carolina]]. Additional scenes were shot in [[Salem, South Carolina]]. 

A scene was also shot at the Mount Carmel Baptist Church cemetery. This site has since been flooded and lies 130 feet under the surface of [[Lake Jocassee]], on the border between [[Oconee County, South Carolina|Oconee]] and [[Pickens County, South Carolina|Pickens]] counties in South Carolina.<ref name="jocassee">{{cite news|url=http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/greenvilleonline/access/1688999131.html?FMT=ABS&amp;date=Feb+20,+2009|title=Cable network to detail history of Lake Jocassee|accessdate=2009-02-25 | work=The Greenville News | first=Anna | last=Simon | date=2009-02-20}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.ohio.com/entertainment/mailbag/69264542.html|title=Body double plays banjo|first=Rich|last=Heldenfels|work=[[Akron Beacon Journal]]|date=2009-11-05|accessdate=2009-11-06}}</ref>

During the filming of the canoe scene, author [[James Dickey]] showed up inebriated and got into a bitter argument with producer-director [[John Boorman]], who had rewritten Dickey's script. They had a brief fistfight in which Boorman's nose was broken and four of his teeth shattered. Dickey was thrown off the set, but no charges were filed against him. The two reconciled and became good friends, and Boorman gave Dickey a cameo role as the sheriff at the end of the film.

=== Stunts ===
The film is famous for cutting costs by not insuring the production and having the actors do their own stunts (most notably, Jon Voight climbed the cliff himself). In one scene, the stunt coordinator decided that a scene showing a canoe with a dummy of Burt Reynolds in it looked phony; he said it looked "like a canoe with a dummy in it."  Reynolds begged to have the scene re-shot with himself in the canoe rather than the dummy.  After shooting the scene, Reynolds, coughing up river water and nursing a broken [[coccyx]], asked how the scene looked.  The director responded, "like a canoe with a dummy in it."

Regarding the courage of the four main actors in the movie doing their own stunts without insurance protection, Dickey was quoted as saying all of them "had more guts than a burglar". In a nod to their stunt-performing audacity, early in the movie Lewis says, "Insurance? I've never been insured in my life. I don't believe in insurance. There's no risk."

===Notorious line===
Several people have been credited with the now-famous line including the phrase, "squeal like a pig." Ned Beatty said he thought of it while he and actor McKinney were improvising the scene.<ref>Burger, Mark. (2006, March 19). "[http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/journalnow/access/1005939731.html?dids=1005939731:1005939731&FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT&type=current&date=Mar+19%2C+2006&author=Mark+Burger+JOURNAL+ARTS+REPORTER&pub=Winston+-+Salem+Journal&edition=&startpage=1&desc=BEATTY+GIVEN+MASTER+OF+CINEMA+AWARD+%3B+CHARACTER+ACTOR+IS+A+VETERAN+OF+MORE+THAN+200+FILM+AND+TELEVISION+PRODUCTIONS BEATTY GIVEN MASTER OF CINEMA AWARD; CHARACTER ACTOR IS A VETERAN OF MORE THAN 200 FILM AND TELEVISION PRODUCTIONS]", ''[[Winston-Salem Journal]]'', Page B1<br>"Regarding his debut film, ''Deliverance'' (1972), in which his character undergoes an unforgettably vivid sexual assault, Beatty said: 'The whole "squeal like a pig" thing ... came from guess who.'  As the audience laughed, he theatrically put his head in his hands and silently pointed to himself, before elaborating how director Boorman encouraged him to improvise the scene with his onscreen tormentor, Bill McKinney."</ref>

James Dickey's son, [[Christopher Dickey]], in his memoir about the film production, ''Summer of Deliverance,'' said that one of the crewmen suggested that Beatty's character, Bobby, "squeal like a pig," to add some backwoods horror to the scene and make it more shocking.{{page needed|date=August 2014}} According to Boorman's running [[Audio commentary|commentary]] on the home media releases, the studio wanted the scene shot two ways, one of which would be acceptable for TV. Boorman did not want to do this. He decided that the phrase "squeal like a pig", suggested by Frank Rickman, a Clayton native, was a good replacement for the dialog in the script. It would work for both the theatrical and TV versions.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}

==Soundtrack==
The film's soundtrack brought new attention to the noted banjo work, which had been recorded numerous times since 1955. Only [[Eric Weissberg]] and Steve Mandel were originally credited for "[[Dueling Banjos]]." Noted songwriter and producer [[Arthur "Guitar Boogie" Smith]], who wrote the original piece, "Feudin' Banjos" (1955), and recorded it with five-string banjo player [[Don Reno]], filed a lawsuit for songwriting credit and a percentage of royalties. He was awarded both in a landmark copyright infringement case. 

No credit was given for the [[film score]]. The film has a number of sparse, brooding passages of music scattered throughout, including several played on a [[synthesizer]]. Some prints of the movie omit much of this extra music. 

Boorman was given a gold record for the "Dueling Banjos" hit single; this was later stolen from his house by the Dublin gangster [[Martin Cahill]]. Boorman recreated this scene in ''[[The General (1998 film)|The General]]'' (1998), his biographical film about Cahill.

==Reception==
''Deliverance'' was a box office success in the United States, becoming the fifth-[[1972 in film#Top grossing films (U.S.)|highest grossing film of 1972]] after grossing a domestic total of over $46 million.<ref name="TN" /> The film's financial success continued the following year, when it went on to earn $18 million in North American [[Gross rental|"distributor rentals"]] (receipts).<ref>"Big Rental Films of 1973", ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'', 9 January 1974 p 19</ref>

===Critical reception===
''Deliverance'' was well received by critics and is widely regarded as one of the best films of 1972.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.filmsite.org/1972.html |title=Greatest Films of 1972 |publisher=Filmsite.org |date= |accessdate=2012-05-05}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.films101.com/y1972r.htm |title=The Best Movies of 1972 by Rank |publisher=Films101.com |date= |accessdate=2012-05-05}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://cinepad.com/awards/best_70s.htm |title=Best Films of the 1970s |publisher=Cinepad.com |date= |accessdate=2012-05-05}}</ref><ref>[http://www.imdb.com/year/1972/ IMDb: Year: 1972<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> The film currently holds a 94% "Certified Fresh" rating on the [[Review aggregator|review aggregate]] website [[Rotten Tomatoes]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/deliverance/ |title=Deliverance |publisher=Rotten Tomatoes |date= |accessdate=2012-05-05}}</ref> 

Not all reviews were positive. [[Roger Ebert]] of the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' said:
<blockquote>Dickey, who wrote the original novel and the screenplay, lards this plot with a lot of significance -- universal, local, whatever happens to be on the market. He is clearly under the impression that he is telling us something about the nature of man, and particularly civilized man's ability to survive primitive challenges[<U+2026>] But I don't think it works that way.[<U+2026>] What the movie totally fails at, however, is its attempt to make some kind of significant statement about its action.[<U+2026>] Dickey has given us here is a fantasy about violence, not a realistic consideration of it.[<U+2026>] It's possible to consider civilized men in a confrontation with the wilderness without throwing in rapes, cowboy-and-Indian stunts and pure exploitative sensationalism.<ref>[http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/deliverance-1972 "Deliverance."] ''Chicago Sun-Times''.</ref></blockquote>

The instrumental piece, "[[Dueling Banjos]]," won the 1974 [[Grammy Award for Best Country Instrumental Performance]]. The film was selected by ''[[The New York Times]]'' as one of ''The Best 1,000 Movies Ever Made'', while the viewers of [[Channel 4]] in the United Kingdom voted it #45 in a list of ''The 100 Greatest Films''.

==Influence of the film ==
*Then-governor [[Jimmy Carter]] established a state film commission to encourage production companies to film in Georgia.  The state has "become one of the top five production destinations in the U.S."<ref name="welles"/>

*The canoes used in the film are displayed at the Burt Reynolds Museum, located at 100 North U.S. Highway 1, in [[Jupiter, Florida]]. One of the canoes used (and signed by Ronny Cox) is on display in the Tallulah Falls Railroad Museum, [[Dillard, Georgia]].

*Following the film, tourism increased to Rabun County by the tens of thousands. By 2012, tourism was the largest source of revenue in the county.<ref name="welles"/> Jon Voight's stunt double for this film, [[Claude Terry]], later purchased equipment used in the movie from Warner Brothers. He founded what is now the oldest whitewater rafting adventure company on the Chattooga River, Southeastern Expeditions.<ref>[http://www.southeasternexpeditions.com/about-us/ Southeastern Expeditions]. Retrieved 8/19/2013.</ref> By 2012 rafting had developed as a $20 million industry in the region.<ref name="welles"/>

*People with money have built vacation and second homes around the area's lakes.<ref name="welles"/>

*In June 2012, Rabun County held a Chattooga River Festival to encourage preservation of the river and its environment. It noted the 40th anniversary of the filming of ''Deliverance'' in the area, which aroused controversy.<ref name="welles"/>

*In 2012, producer Cory Welles and director Kevin Walker decided to make the documentary, ''The Deliverance of Rabun County,'' to explore the effects of the landmark film on people in the county. They heard a wide range of opinions, particularly resentment at how the country people were portrayed. Others are pragmatic and looking at the benefits of increased tourism and related businesses.<ref name="welles">[http://www.marketplace.org/topics/life/40-years-later-deliverance-causes-mixed-feelings-georgia Cory Welles, "40 years later, 'Deliverance' causes mixed feelings in Georgia"], Marketplace, 22 August 2012, accessed 27 August 2014</ref>
