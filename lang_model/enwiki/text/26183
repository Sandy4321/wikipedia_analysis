Although [[Buddhism]] was in decline and under attack by [[Neo-Confucian]] critics in the Song era, it nonetheless remained one of the major religious ideologies in China.]]
[[China|Chinese]] '''society in the [[Song Dynasty]]''' (960<U+2013>1279 AD) was marked by political and legal reforms, a philosophical revival of [[Confucianism]], and the development of cities beyond administrative purposes into centers of trade, industry, and [[Maritime history|maritime]] commerce. The inhabitants of rural areas were mostly farmers, although some were also hunters, fishers, or government employees working in mines or the salt marshes. Contrarily, shopkeepers, artisans, city guards, entertainers, laborers, and wealthy merchants lived in the county and provincial centers along with the [[Gentry (China)|Chinese gentry]]&mdash;a small, elite community of educated scholars and [[Scholar-bureaucrats|scholar-officials]]. As landholders and drafted government officials, the gentry considered themselves the leading members of society; gaining their cooperation and employment was essential for the county or provincial bureaucrat overburdened with official duties. In many ways, scholar-officials of the Song period differed from the more aristocratic scholar-officials of the [[Tang Dynasty]] (618&ndash;907). [[Civil service]] examinations became the primary means of appointment to an official post, and competitors vying for official degrees dramatically increased. Frequent disagreements between ministers of state, on which policies were most beneficial to the economy, the people, and their own careers, often led to political strife within the central court and gave rise to political factions, hindering the central government's ability to administer the empire and uphold political stability. 

Confucian or [[Legalism (Chinese philosophy)|Legalist]] scholars in ancient China<U+2014>perhaps as far back as the late [[Zhou Dynasty]] (c. 1046&ndash;256 BC)<U+2014>categorized all socio-economic groups into [[Four occupations|four broad and hierarchical occupations]] (in descending order): the ''[[wiktionary:<U+58EB>|shi]]'' (scholars, or gentry), the ''[[wiktionary:<U+519C>|nong]]'' (peasant farmers), the ''[[wiktionary:<U+5DE5>|gong]]'' (artisans and craftsmen), and the ''[[wiktionary:<U+5546>|shang]]'' (merchants).<ref name="fairbank 108">Fairbank, 108.</ref> Wealthy landholders and officials possessed the resources to better prepare their sons for the civil service [[Imperial examinations|examinations]], yet they were often rivaled in their power and wealth by merchants of the Song period. Merchants frequently colluded commercially and politically with officials, despite the fact that scholar-officials looked down on mercantile vocations as less respectable pursuits than farming or craftsmanship. The military also provided a means for advancement in Song society for those who became officers, even though soldiers were not highly-respected members of society. Although certain domestic and familial duties were expected of women in Song society, they nonetheless enjoyed a wide range of social and legal rights in an otherwise [[patriarchy|patriarchal]] society. Women's improved rights to property came gradually with the increasing value of [[dowry|dowries]] offered by brides' families.

[[Taoism|Daoism]] and [[Buddhism]] were the dominant religions of China in the Song era, the latter deeply impacting many beliefs and principles of [[Neo-Confucianism]] throughout the dynasty. Ironically, Buddhism came under heavy criticism by staunch Confucian advocates and philosophers of the time. Older beliefs in ancient [[Chinese mythology]], [[Chinese folk religion|folk religion]], and [[ancestor worship]] also played a large part in people's daily lives, as the Chinese believed that deities and ghosts of the spiritual realm frequently interacted with the living realm. 

The Song justice system was maintained by policing sheriffs, investigators, official coroners, and exam-drafted officials who acted as [[magistrate]]s. Song magistrates were encouraged to apply both their practical knowledge as well as the written law in making judicial decisions that would promote societal morality. Advancements in early [[forensic science]], a greater emphasis on gathering credible evidence, and careful recording by clerks of autopsy reports and witness testimonies aided authorities in convicting criminals.

Chinese cities of the Song period became some of the largest in the world, owing to [[Technology of the Song Dynasty|technological advances]] and an [[Economy of the Song Dynasty|agricultural revolution]].<ref name="embree 338">Embree, 338.</ref> [[Kaifeng]], which served as the capital and seat of government during the [[Song Dynasty#History|Northern Song]] (960&ndash;1127), had some half a million residents in 1021, with another half-million living in the city's nine designated suburbs.<ref name="fairbank 89">Fairbank, 89.</ref> By 1100, the civilian population within the city walls was 1,050,000; the army stationed there brought the total to 1.4 million.<ref name="fairbank 89"/> [[Hangzhou]], the capital during the [[History of the Song Dynasty#From Northern Song to Southern Song|Southern Song]] (1127&ndash;1279), had more than 400,000 inhabitants during the late 12th century, primarily due to its trading position at the southern end of the [[Grand Canal of China|Grand Canal]], known as the lower [[Yangtze River|Yangzi's]] "grain basket."<ref name="gernet 29">Gernet, 29.</ref><ref name="fairbank 89"/> During the 13th century, the city's population soared to approximately a million people, with the 1270 census counting 186,330 registered families living in the city.<ref name="ebrey 167">Ebrey et al., 167.</ref><ref name="gernet 29"/> Although not as agriculturally rich as areas like western [[Sichuan]], the region of [[Fujian]] also underwent a massive population growth; government records indicate a 1500% increase in the number of registered households from the years 742 to 1208.<ref name="golas">{{cite journal | author=Golas, Peter| title=Rural China in the Song | journal=The Journal of Asian Studies| year=1980| volume=| issue=| page=291<U+2013>325| url=http://mutex.gmu.edu:2112/view/00219118/di973705/97p01513/4?searchUrl=http%3a//www.jstor.org/search/BasicResults%3fhp%3d25%26si%3d1%26gw%3djtx%26jtxsi%3d1%26jcpsi%3d1%26artsi%3d1%26Query%3dSong%2bDynasty%2bTechnology%2bScience%26wc%3don&frame=noframe&currentResult=00219118%2bdi973705%2b97p01513%2b0%2cEFFFFFFF0F&userID=81ae37f5@gmu.edu/01cc993312ea3113b864848d&dpi=3&config=jstor}}</ref>  With a thriving [[shipbuilding]] industry and new [[mining]] facilities, Fujian became the economic powerhouse of China during the Song period.<ref name="golas"/> The great seaport of China, [[Quanzhou]], was located in Fujian, and by 1120 its governor claimed that the city's population had reached some 500,000.<ref name="ebrey cambridge 144"/> The inland Fujianese city of [[Nanjing|Jiankang]] was also very large at this time, with a population of about 200,000.<ref name="ebrey cambridge 144"/>

China's newly commercialized society was evident in the differences between its northern capital and the earlier Tang capital at [[Chang'an]]. A center of great wealth, Chang'an's importance as the political center eclipsed its importance as a commercial [[entrep<U+00F4>t]]; [[Yangzhou]] was the economic hub of China during the Tang period.<ref name="benn 46">Benn, 46.</ref> On the other hand, Kaifeng's role as a commercial center in China was as important as its political role.<ref name="ebrey cambridge 144">Ebrey, ''Cambridge Illustrated History of China'', 144.</ref> The Song era marketplaces in Kaifeng were open every hour of the day, whereas a strict curfew was imposed upon the two official marketplaces of Chang'an starting at dusk; this curfew limited its commercial potential.<ref name="ebrey cambridge 144"/> Shopkeepers and peddlers began selling their goods at dawn.<ref name="gernet 183">Gernet, 183.</ref> Along the wide avenue of the Imperial Way, breakfast delicacies were sold in shops and stalls and peddlers offered hot water for washing the face at the entrances of [[public bathing|bathhouses]].<ref name="gernet 183 184">Gernet, 183&ndash;184.</ref> Lively activity in the markets did not begin to wane until about the evening meal of the day, while noodle shops remained open all day and night.<ref name="gernet 184">Gernet, 184.</ref> People in the Song era were also more eager to purchase houses located near bustling markets than in earlier periods. Kaifeng's wealthy, multi-story houses and common urban dwellings were situated along the streets of the city, rather than hidden inside walled compounds and gated wards as they had been in the earlier Tang capital.<ref name="ebrey cambridge 144"/>

The municipal government of Hangzhou enacted policies and programs that aided in the maintenance of the city and ensured the well-being of its inhabitants. In order to maintain order in such a large city, four or five guards were quartered in the city at intervals of about {{convert|300|yd|m}}.<ref name="gernet 36">Gernet, 36.</ref> Their main duties were to prevent brawls and thievery, patrol the streets at night, and quickly warn the public when fires broke out.<ref name="gernet 35 36">Gernet, 35&ndash;36.</ref> The government assigned 2,000 soldiers to 14 fire stations built to combat the spread of fire within the city, and stationed 1,200 soldiers in fire stations outside the city's ramparts.<ref name="ebrey 167"/><ref name="gernet 35"/>  These stations were placed {{convert|500|yd|m}} apart, with watchtowers that were permanently manned by 100 men each.<ref name="gernet 34">Gernet, 34.</ref> Like earlier cities, the Song capitals featured wide, open avenues to create fire breaks.<ref name="gernet 34"/> However, widespread fires remained a constant threat. When a fire broke out in 1137, the government suspended the requirement of rent payments, alms of 108,840 kg (120 tons) of rice were distributed to the poor, and items such as bamboo, planks, and rush-matting were exempt from government taxation.<ref name="gernet 35">Gernet, 35.</ref> Fires were not the only problem facing the residents of Hangzhou and other crowded cities. Far more than in the rural countryside, poverty was widespread and became a major topic of debate at the central court and in local governments. To mitigate its effects, the Song government enacted many initiatives, including the distribution of alms to the poor; the establishment of public clinics, pharmacies, and retirement homes; and the creation of paupers' graveyards.<ref name="ebrey 167"/><ref name="China"/> In fact, each administrative prefecture had public hospitals managed by the state, where the poor, aged, sick, and incurable could be cared for free of charge.<ref name="gernet 172">Gernet, 172.</ref>
 
To ensure an orderly urban life and a properly-functioning empire, the Song court made certain that the countryside was run efficiently. Within the largest political divisions known as circuits (lu) there were a number of prefectures ([[Zhou (political division)|zhou]]), which in turn [[History of the political divisions of China|were divided]] into the smallest political units of counties ([[County (China)|xian]]); there were about 1,230 counties during the Song period.<ref name="fairbank 106">Fairbank, 106.</ref><ref>Yuan, 193&ndash;194</ref> In order to maintain swift communication from one town or city to another, the Song laid out many miles of roadways and [[Architecture of the Song Dynasty#Grandiose bridges|hundreds of bridges]] throughout rural China. They also maintained an efficient postal service nicknamed the ''hot-foot relay'', which featured thousands of postal officers managed by the central government.<ref name="needham volume 4 36">Needham, Volume 4, 36.</ref>  Postal clerks kept records of dispatches, and postal stations maintained a staff of cantonal officers who guarded mail delivery routes.<ref name="needham volume 4 part 3 35">Needham, Volume 4, Part 3, 35.</ref> After the Song period, the [[Yuan Dynasty]] (1279&ndash;1368) transformed the postal system into a more militarized organization, with couriers managed under controllers.<ref name="needham volume 4 36"/> This system persisted from the 14th century until the 19th century, when the telegraph and modern road-building were introduced to China from the West.<ref name="needham volume 4 36"/>

===Amusements===
[[Image:Song Dynasty Elegant Party.JPG|thumb|right|240px|A [[Chinese painting]] of an outdoor banquet, a [[Song Dynasty]] painting and possible remake of a [[Tang Dynasty]] original.]]
A wide variety of social clubs for affluent Chinese became popular during the Song period. A text dated 1235 mentions that in Hangzhou City alone there was the West Lake Poetry Club, the Buddhist Tea Society, the Physical Fitness Club, the Anglers' Club, the Occult Club, the Young Girls' Chorus, the Exotic Foods Club, the Plants and Fruits Club, the Antique Collectors' Club, the Horse-Lovers' Club, and the Refined Music Society.<ref name="ebrey 167"/>  No formal event or festival was complete without banquets, which necessitated catering companies.<ref name="ebrey 167"/> 

The entertainment quarters of Kaifeng, Hangzhou, and other cities featured amusements including [[snake charming|snake charmers]], [[sword swallowing|sword swallowers]], fortunetellers, acrobats, puppeteers, actors, storytellers, [[Culture of the Song Dynasty#Food and cuisine|tea houses and restaurants]], and brokers offering young women who could serve as hired maids, concubines, singing girls, or prostitutes.<ref name="ebrey 167"/><ref name="gernet 222">Gernet, 222.</ref><ref name="gernet 225">Gernet, 225.</ref><ref name="gernet 224"/><ref name="rossabi 78">Rossabi, 78.</ref>  These entertainment quarters, covered bazaars known as ''pleasure grounds'', were places where strict social morals and formalities could be largely ignored.<ref name="gernet 222"/> The pleasure grounds were located within the city, outside the ramparts near the gates, and in the suburbs; each was regulated by a state-appointed official.<ref name="gernet 222 223">Gernet, 222&ndash;223.</ref> Games and entertainments were an all-day affair, while the taverns and singing girl houses were open until two o'clock in the morning.<ref name="gernet 184"/> While being served by waiters and ladies who heated up wine for parties, drinking playboys in winehouses would often be approached by common folk called "idlers" (''xianhan'') who offered to run errands, fetch and send money, and summon singing girls.<ref name="west 76">West, 76.</ref>

Dramatic performances, often accompanied by music, were popular in the markets.<ref name="gernet 223"/> The actors were distinguished in rank by type and color of clothing, honing their acting skills at drama schools.<ref name="gernet 223">Gernet, 223.</ref> [[satire|Satirical]] sketches denouncing corrupt government officials were especially popular.<ref name="gernet 224">Gernet, 224.</ref> Actors on stage always spoke their lines in [[Classical Chinese]]; [[vernacular Chinese]] that imitated the [[Mandarin (linguistics)|common spoken language]] was not introduced into theatrical performances until the subsequent Yuan Dynasty.<ref>Rossabi, 162.</ref> Although trained to speak in the erudite Classical language, acting troupes commonly drew their membership from one of the lowest social groups in society: prostitutes.<ref name="west 72">West, 72.</ref> Of the fifty some theatres located in the pleasure grounds of Kaifeng, four of these theatres were large enough to entertain audiences of several thousand each, drawing huge crowds which nearby businesses thrived upon.<ref name="west 76">West, 76.</ref>

There were also many vibrant [[Culture of the Song Dynasty#Festivities|public festivities]] held in cities and rural communities. [[Martial arts]] were a source of public entertainment; the Chinese held fighting matches on [[lei tai]], a raised platform without rails.<ref name="wu">{{cite web |url=http://www.eagleclaw.gr/en/istoria_wushu.htm |title=Wushu History |accessdate=2007-11-14  |year=1995 |work=Ying Shou Guan| publisher=International Wushu Federation}}</ref>  With the rise in popularity of distinctive urban and domestic activities during the Song Dynasty, there was a decline in traditional outdoor Chinese pastimes such as hunting, horseback riding, and [[polo]].<ref name="China"/> In terms of domestic leisure, the Chinese enjoyed a host of different activities, including board games such as [[xiangqi]] and [[Go (board game)|go]]. There were lavish garden spaces designated for those wishing to stroll, and people often took their boats out on the lake to entertain guests or to [[Dragon boat|stage boat races]].<ref name="gernet 222"/><ref>Yang, 46.</ref>

===Foreign minorities===

Much like the multicultural and metropolitan atmosphere of the earlier Tang capital at Chang'an, the Song capitals at Kaifeng and Hangzhou were home to an array of traveling foreigners and ethnic minorities. There were several trade embassies from [[Fatimid|Egypt]], [[History of the Song Dynasty#China's first standing navy|Yemen]], and [[Kulothunga Chola I|India]] that came to Song China in order to bolster trade relations.<ref>Hall, 23.</ref><ref>Shen, 157&ndash;158.</ref> During the 9th century, the Tang seaport at [[Guangzhou]] had a large [[Muslim]] population.<ref name="gernet 82">Gernet, 82.</ref> During the Song Dynasty the importance of the latter seaport declined as the ports of [[Quanzhou]] and [[Fuzhou]] in Fujian province eclipsed it.<ref name="gernet 82"/> This was followed by a decline of Middle Eastern sea merchants in China and an increasing amount of Chinese ship owners engaging in maritime trade.<ref name="gernet 82"/> However, Middle Eastern merchants and other foreigners were not entirely absent, and some even gained administrative posts.<ref name="gernet 82 83">Gernet, 82&ndash;83.</ref> For example, the Muslim Kuwabara served as the Commissioner of Merchant Shipping for Quanzhou between the years 1250 and 1275, where he wrote a monograph on the Chinese shipping industry and maritime economy.<ref name="needham volume 4 part 3 465">Needham, Volume 4, Part 3, 465.</ref> There was also the [[Islamic science|Arab astronomer]] [[Ma Yize]] (910&ndash;1005), who became the chief astronomer of the Song court under [[Emperor Taizu of Song|Taizu]]. Muslims represented the largest minority within Song China, although there were many others.<ref name="gernet 215"/> There was a community of [[Kaifeng Jews]], who followed the exodus of the Song court to Hangzhou once the Jurchens invaded the north in 1126.<ref name="gernet 82"/> [[Manichaeism]] from [[Persia]] was introduced during the Tang Dynasty; during the Song Dynasty the Manichaean sects were most prominent in Fujian and [[Zhejiang]].<ref name="gernet 215">Gernet, 215.</ref> [[Nestorianism in China|Nestorian Christianity in China]] had for the most part died out after the Tang Dynasty; however, it was revived during the Mongol invasions in the 13th century.<ref name="gernet 215"/> Followers of [[Zoroastrianism]] still had temples in China as well.<ref name="west 72">West, 72.</ref>

==Rural life==
[[Image:Fishermen's Evening Song.jpg|thumb|left|400px|''Fishermen's Evening Song'', by [[Xu Daoning]], c. 1049.]]
In many ways, life for peasants in the countryside during the Song Dynasty was similar to those living in previous dynasties. The people spent their days ploughing and planting in the fields, tending to their families, selling crops and goods at local markets, visiting local temples, and arranging ceremonies such as marriages.<ref name="ebrey cambridge 155"/> Cases of banditry, which local officials were forced to combat, occurred constantly in the countryside.<ref name="ebrey cambridge 155"/> There were varying types of land ownership and tenure depending on the topography and climate of one's locality. In hilly, peripheral areas far from trade routes, most peasant farmers owned and cultivated their own fields.<ref name="ebrey cambridge 155"/> In frontier regions such as [[Hunan]] and [[Sichuan]], owners of wealthy estates gathered [[serf]]s to till their lands.<ref name="ebrey cambridge 155"/> The most advanced areas had few estates with serfs tilling the fields; these regions had long fostered wet-rice cultivation, which did not require centralized management of farming.<ref name="ebrey cambridge 155"/> Landlords set fixed rents for [[tenant farmer]]s in these regions, while independent small farming families also owned their own lots.<ref name="ebrey cambridge 155"/> The Song government provided tax incentives to farmers who tilled lands along the edges of lakes, marshes, seas, and [[Terrace (agriculture)|terraced mountain slopes]].<ref name="ebrey cambridge 156">Ebrey, ''Cambridge Illustrated History of China'', 156.</ref> Farming was made possible in these difficult terrains due to improvements in damming techniques and using [[chain pump]]s to elevate water to higher irrigation planes.<ref name="ebrey cambridge 156 157">Ebrey, Cambridge Illustrated History of China, 156&ndash;157.</ref> Water buffalos were used as draft animals for ploughing and harrowing the fields, while properly aged and mixed compost and manure was constantly spread.<ref name="ebrey cambridge 157">Ebrey, ''Cambridge Illustrated History of China'', 157.</ref> The widespread cultivation of rice in China necessitated new trends of labor and agricultural techniques. An effective yield from rice paddies required careful transplanting of rows of rice seedlings, sufficient weeding, maintenance of water levels, and draining of fields for harvest.<ref name="ebrey cambridge 157"/> Planting and weeding often required a dirty day of work, since the farmers had to wade through the muddy water of the rice paddies on bare feet.<ref name="ebrey cambridge 157"/>

==Social class==
[[Image:Songhuizong8.jpg|right|140px|thumb|''Listening to the [[Guqin|Qin]]'', by [[Emperor Huizong of Song|Huizong]], 11th century; playing the musical instrument of the qin was one of the leisurely pursuits of the [[Scholar-bureaucrats|scholar-official]].]]
One of the fundamental changes in Chinese society from the Tang Dynasty to the Song Dynasty was the transformation of the scholarly elite, which included the [[Scholar-bureaucrats|scholar-officials]] and all those who held examination degrees or were candidates of the [[Imperial examinations|civil service examinations]]. The Song scholar-officials and examination candidates were better educated, less [[aristocrat]]ic in their habits, and more numerous than in the Tang period.<ref name="ebrey 159">Ebrey, 159.</ref><ref name="fairbank 95"/>  Following the logic of the [[Chinese classic texts|Confucian philosophical classics]], Song scholar-officials viewed themselves as highly moralistic figures whose responsibility was to keep greedy merchants and power-hungry military men in their place.<ref name="fairbank 96">Fairbank, 96.</ref>  Even if a degree-holding scholar was never appointed to an official government post, he nonetheless felt himself responsible for upholding morality in society, and became an elite member of his community.<ref name="fairbank 95">Fairbank, 95.</ref>

Arguably the most influential factor shaping this new class was the competitive nature of scholarly candidates entering civil service through the imperial examinations.<ref name="ebrey cambridge 145 146">Ebrey, ''Cambridge Illustrated History of China'', 145<U+2013>146</ref> Although not all scholar-officials came from the landholding class, sons of prominent landholders had better access to higher education, and thus greater ability to pass examinations for government service.<ref name="ebrey 162">Ebrey, 162.</ref><ref name="fairbank 94 95">Fairbank, 94&ndash;95.</ref> Gaining a scholarly degree by passing prefectural, provincial, or palace exams in the Song period was the most important prerequisite in being considered for appointment, especially to higher posts; this was a departure from the Tang period, when the examination system was enacted on a much smaller scale.<ref name="ebrey cambridge 145">Ebrey, ''Cambridge Illustrated History of China'', 145.</ref> A higher degree attained through the three levels of examinations meant a greater chance of obtaining higher offices in government. Not only did this ensure a higher salary, but also greater social prestige, visibly distinguished by dress. This institutionalized distinction of scholar-officials by dress included the type and even color of [[Han Chinese clothing|traditional silken robes]], hats, and girdles, demarcating that scholar-official's level of administrative authority.<ref name="gernet 127 128">Gernet, 127<U+2013>128.</ref> This rigid code of dress was especially enforced during the beginning of the dynasty, although the prestigious clothing color of purple slowly began to diffuse through the ranks of middle and low grade officials.<ref name="gernet 128">Gernet, 128.</ref> 

Scholar-officials also distinguished themselves through their intellectual pursuits. While some such as [[Shen Kuo]] (1031&ndash;1095) and [[Su Song]] (1020&ndash;1101) dabbled in every known field of science, study, and statecraft, Song elites were generally most interested in the leisurely pursuits of composing and reciting poetry, art collecting, and [[antiquarian]]ism.<ref name="ebrey 162 163">Ebrey, 162<U+2013>163.</ref> Yet even this pursuit could turn into a scholarly one. It was the official, historian, poet, and essayist [[Ouyang Xiu]] (1007&ndash;1072) who compiled an analytical catalogue of ancient rubbings on stone and bronze which pioneered ideas in early [[epigraphy]] and [[archeology]].<ref name="ebrey cambridge 148">Ebrey, ''Cambridge Illustrated History of China'', 148.</ref> Shen Kuo even took an [[interdisciplinarity|interdisciplinary]] approach to archeological study, in order to aid his work in astronomy, mathematics, and recording [[Bar (music)|ancient musical measures]].<ref>Fraser & Haber, 227.</ref> The scholar-official and historian [[Zeng Gong]] (1019&ndash;1083) reclaimed last chapters of the ancient ''[[Zhan Guo Ce]]'', proofreading and editing the version that would become the accepted modern version. The ideal official and gentry scholars were also expected to employ these intellectual pursuits for the good of the community, such as writing local histories or [[gazetteer]]s.<ref name="fairbank 104">Fairbank, 104.</ref> In the case of Shen Kuo and Su Song, their pursuits in academic fields such as classifying [[Traditional Chinese Medicine|pharmaceuticals]] and improving calendrical science through work in [[Chinese astronomy|astronomy]] fit this ideal.

Literati painters of the Song period and subsequent dynasties often remade scenes that were painted in earlier dynasties, while adding their own unique style and artistic expression.]]
The wealthy families living on the estates of these scholar-officials <U+2013> as well as rich merchants, princes, and nobles <U+2013> often maintained a massive entourage of employed servants, technical staffs, and personal favorites.<ref name="gernet 92 93">Gernet, 92<U+2013>93.</ref> They hired personal artisans such as jewellers, sculptors, and [[embroidery|embroiderers]], while servants cleaned house, shopped for goods, attended to kitchen duties, and prepared furnishings for banquets, weddings, and funerals.<ref name="gernet 92 93"/> Rich families also hosted literary men such as secretaries, copyists, and hired tutors to educate their sons.<ref name="gernet 93">Gernet, 93.</ref> They were also the patrons of musicians, painters, poets, chess players, and storytellers.<ref name="gernet 93"/> This patronage of various [[courtier]]s by rich and noble families was in many ways similar to those described during the [[Renaissance|European Renaissance]] by [[Baldassare Castiglione]] (1478&ndash;1529) in his ''[[Book of the Courtier]]''.<ref>Castiglione, 12.</ref>

The historian Jacques Gernet stresses that these servants and favorites hosted by rich families represented the more fortunate members of the lower class.<ref name="gernet 94"/> Other laborers and workers such as water-carriers, [[navvy|navvies]], peddlers, [[Physiognomy|physiognomists]], and soothsayers "lived for the most part from hand to mouth."<ref name="gernet 94"/> The entertainment business in the covered bazaars in the marketplace and at the entrances of bridges also provided a lowly means of occupation for storytellers, puppeteers, jugglers, acrobats, [[tightrope walking|tightrope walkers]], exhibitors of wild animals, and old soldiers who flaunted their strength by lifting heavy beams, iron weights, and stones for show.<ref name="gernet 94"/> These people found the best and most competitive work during [[Chinese holidays|annual festivals]].<ref name="gernet 94 95">Gernet, 94<U+2013>95.</ref> In contrast, the rural poor consisted mostly of [[peasant|peasant farmers]]. However, some in rural areas chose vocations centered chiefly around hunting, fishing, forestry, and state-offered occupations such as mining or working in the [[salt marsh]]es.<ref name="gernet 102">Gernet, 102.</ref>

According to their Confucian ethics, elite and cultured scholar-officials viewed themselves as the pinnacle members of society (second only to the imperial family). Rural farmers were seen as the essential pillars that provided food for all of society; they were given more respect than the local or regional merchant, no matter how rich and powerful. The Confucian-taught scholar-official elite who ran China's vast bureaucracy viewed their society's growing interest in commercialism as a sign of moral decay. Nonetheless, Song Chinese urban society was teeming with wholesalers, shippers, storage keepers, brokers, traveling salesmen, retail shopkeepers, peddlers, and many other lowly commercial-based vocations.<ref name="China">China.

Despite the scholar-officials' suspicion and disdain for powerful merchants, the latter often colluded with the scholarly elite.<ref name="gernet 60 61"/> The scholar-officials themselves often became involved in mercantile affairs, blurring the lines of who did and did not belong to the merchant class.<ref name="gernet 60 61">Gernet, 60<U+2013>61.</ref> Even rural farmers engaged in the small-scale production of wine, charcoal, paper, textiles, and other goods.<ref name="ebrey cambridge 141">Ebrey, ''Cambridge Illustrated History of China'', 141.</ref> Theoretically it was forbidden for an official to partake in private affairs of gaining capital while serving and receiving a salary from the state.<ref name="gernet 68">Gernet, 68.</ref> In order to avoid ruining one's reputation as a moral Confucian, scholar-officials had to work through business intermediaries; as early as 955 a written decree revealed the use of intermediary agents for private business transactions with foreign countries.<ref name="gernet 68 69">Gernet, 68<U+2013>69.</ref> Since the Song government took over several key industries and imposed strict state monopolies, the government itself acted as a large commercial enterprise run by scholar-officials.<ref name="gernet 77">Gernet, 77.</ref> The state also had to contend with the merchant and artisan [[guild]]s; whenever the state requisitioned goods and assessed taxes it dealt with guild heads, who ensured fair prices and fair wages via official intermediaries.<ref name="gernet 88">Gernet, 88.</ref><ref name="ebrey 157">Ebrey, 157.</ref> Yet joining a guild was an immediate means to neither empowerment nor independence; historian Jacques Gernet states: "[the guilds] were too numerous and too varied to allow their influence to be felt."<ref name="gernet 94">Gernet, 94.</ref>

From the scholar-official's view, the [[artisan]]s and craftsmen were essential workers in society on a tier just below the farming peasants, and different from the merchants and traders who were considered parasitic. It was craftsmen and artisans who fashioned and manufactured all of the goods needed in Song society, such as standard-sized [[waterwheel]]s and [[chain pump]]s made by skilled [[wheelwright]]s.<ref name="needham volume 4 part 2 347">Needham, Volume 4, Part 2, 347.</ref>  Although architects and carpenter builders were not as highly venerated as the scholar-officials, there were some architectural engineers and authors who gained wide acclaim at court and in the public sphere for their achievements. This included the official [[Architecture of the Song Dynasty#Literature|Li Jie]] (1065&ndash;1110), a scholar who was eventually promoted to high positions in government agencies of building and engineering. [[Yingzao Fashi|His written manual]] on building codes and procedures was sponsored by [[Emperor Huizong of Song|Emperor Huizong]] for these government agencies to employ and was widely printed for the benefit of literate craftsmen and artisans nationwide.<ref name="needham volume 4 part 3 84">Needham, Volume 4, Part 3, 84.</ref><ref name="guo 4 6">Guo, 4<U+2013>6.</ref>  The technical written work of the earlier 10th century architect [[Yu Hao]] was also given a great amount of praise by the [[polymath]] scholar-official Shen Kuo in his ''[[Dream Pool Essays]]'' of 1088.<ref name="needham volume 4 part 3 82 84">Needham, Volume 4, Part 3, 82&ndash;84.</ref>

Due to previous episodes of court [[eunuch]]s amassing power, eunuchs were looked upon with suspicion by scholar-officials and the Confucian [[literati]]. Still, their association with inner palace life and their frequent appointments to high levels of military command made them prestigious members of society.<ref name="ebrey 166">Ebrey, 166.</ref>  Although military officers with successful careers could gain a considerable amount of prestige, the soldier in Song society was looked upon with a bit of disdain by scholar-officials and cultured people.<ref name="graff 25 26"/>  This is best reflected in a Chinese proverb: "Good iron isn't used for nails; good men aren't used as soldiers."<ref name="graff 26"/> This attitude had several roots. Many people who enrolled themselves as soldiers in the armed forces were rural peasants in debt, many of them former workers of the salt trade who could not pay back their loans and had been reduced to flight.<ref name="gernet 102 103">Gernet, 102<U+2013>103.</ref> However, the prevailing attitude towards military servicemen stemmed largely from the knowledge of [[Military history of China|historical precedent]], as military leaders in the late Tang Dynasty and the [[Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms]] (907&ndash;960) period amassed more power than the civil officials, in some respects replacing them and the civilian government altogether.<ref name="gernet 70 71">Gernet, 70&ndash;71.</ref> Song emperors expanded the civil service examination system and government school system in order to avoid the earlier scenario of domination by military strongmen over the civil order.<ref name="ebrey cambridge 145 146">Ebrey, ''Cambridge Illustrated History of China'', 145<U+2013>146.</ref>

==Education and civil service==
[[Image:Chinesischer Maler des 11. Jahrhunderts (III) 001.jpg|thumb|left|200px|''Scholar in a Meadow'', [[Chinese painting]] of the 11th century.]]
The number of applicants for the [[Imperial examination]]s far outmatched the actual number of [[jinshi]], or "presented scholars" who were given official appointments in the Song Dynasty. Five times more jinshi were accepted in the Song period than during the Tang, yet the larger number of degree holders did not lower the prestige of the degree. Rather, it encouraged more to enter and compete in the exams.<ref name="ebrey 160">Ebrey, 160.</ref>  Roughly 30,000 men took the prefectural exams in the early 11th century, increasing to nearly 80,000 around 1100, and finally to an astonishing 400,000 exam takers by the 13th century.<ref name="ebrey 160"/>  With these odds, the chances of an applicant passing the examination and becoming a graduate was 1 in 333.<ref name="ebrey 160"/> Once a degree was obtained, however, this did not ensure an immediate path to office. The total number of scholar-officials in the Tang was about 18,000, while the total number in the Song had only increased to about 20,000.<ref name="fairbank 106"/> With China's growing population and an almost stagnant number of officials accepted into government, the degree holders who were not appointed to office fulfilled an important role on the grassroots level of society.<ref name="fairbank 106"/> They became the local elite of their communities, while scholar-officials relied upon them for maintaining order and fulfilling various duties under their jurisdiction.<ref name="fairbank 106"/>

An atmosphere of intellectual competition existed between aspiring Confucian scholars. Wealthy families were eager to gather stacks of published books for their personal libraries, collecting books that covered the [[Confucian classics]] as well as philosophical works, mathematical treatises, pharmaceutical documents, Buddhist [[sutra]]s, and other literature aimed at the gentry class.<ref name="159 160">Ebrey, 159<U+2013>160.</ref>  The advancement of widespread book manufacturing through [[woodblock printing]] and then [[movable type]] [[printing]] by the 11th century aided in the expansion of the number of educated candidates for the civil service exams.<ref name="ebrey 159"/><ref name="ebrey cambridge 147"/><ref name="fairbank 94">Fairbank, 94.</ref> These developments also reduced the overall cost of books so that they became more accessible to those of lesser means.<ref name="ebrey 159"/><ref name="ebrey cambridge 147">Ebrey, ''Cambridge Illustrated History of China'', 147.</ref>

Song scholar-officials were granted ranks, honors, and career appointments on the basis of merit, the standards of which were codified and more objective than those in the Tang Dynasty.<ref name="ebrey 159">Ebrey, 159.</ref>  The anonymity of exam candidates guarded against fraud and favoritism by those who could judge papers based upon handwriting and/or signature [[Chinese calligraphy|calligraphy]]; a bureau of copyists was tasked with the job of recopying all the candidates' papers before grading.<ref name="gernet 65">Gernet, 65.</ref><ref name="fairbank 94"/> After passing the prefectural, provincial, and then palace exam (the most prestigious), scholarly degrees did not immediately ensure an appointment to office, but the more prestigious the degree, the more certain one's career in higher administrative posts would be.<ref name="gernet 65"/> The central government held the exclusive right to appoint or remove officials.<ref name="gernet 65 66"/> The case for removal was always carefully examined, since the central government kept a recorded dossier of reports on each official, stored in the capital for later review.<ref name="gernet 65 66">Gernet, 65<U+2013>66.</ref> [[Meritocracy]] and a greater sense of [[social mobility]] were also prevalent in the civil service examination system, as the government held a list of all examination graduates, showing that only roughly half of those who passed had a father, or grandfather, or great-grandfather who served as a government official.<ref name="ebrey 162">Ebrey et al., 162.</ref>  However, families with members who were officials of the government had the advantage of early education and experience, often appointing their sons to low-level staff positions.<ref name="gernet 67">Gernet, 67.</ref> The Song era poet [[Su Shi]] (1037&ndash;1101) wrote a poem called ''On the Birth of My Son'', poking fun at the situation of affluent children having the upper edge over bright children of lower status:

The first nationwide government-funded school system in China was established in the year 3 AD under [[Emperor Ping of Han]] (9 BC&ndash;5 AD).<ref name="yuan 193">Yuan, 193.</ref> During the Northern Song Dynasty, the government gradually reestablished an official school system after it was heavily damaged during the preceding [[Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms|Five Dynasties]] period.<ref name="yuan 195">Yuan, 195.</ref> Government-established schools soon eclipsed the role of private academies by the mid-11th century.<ref name="walton 199">Walton, 199.</ref><ref name="yuan 200">Yuan, 200.</ref> At the apex of higher education in the school system were the central schools located in the capital city, the [[Guozijian]], the [[Taixue]], and several vocational schools.<ref name="yuan 194">Yuan, 194.</ref> The first major reform effort to rebuild prefectural and county schools was initiated by Chancellor [[Fan Zhongyan]] (989&ndash;1052) in the 1040s. Before this time, the bulk of funds allotted for the establishment of prefectural and county schools was left up to private financing and minimal amount of government funding; Fan's reform effort started the trend of greater government financing, at least for prefectural schools.<ref name="yuan 196 197">Yuan, 196&ndash;197</ref> Major expansion of educational facilities was initiated by [[Emperor Huizong of Song]] (r. 1100&ndash;1126), who used funds originally allotted for disaster relief and food-price stabilizing to fund new prefectural and county schools and demoted officials who neglected to repair, rebuild, and maintain these government schools.<ref name="yuan 197 199">Yuan, 197&ndash;199.</ref> The historian John W.

By the late 12th century, many critics of the examination system and government-run schools initiated a movement to revive private academies.<ref name="walton 199"/> One of the earliest academic institutions established in the Song period was the [[Yuelu Academy]], founded in 976 during the reign of [[Emperor Taizu of Song]]. The Chinese scientist and statesman Shen Kuo was once the head chancellor of the [[Hanlin Academy]],<ref name="needham volume 1 135">Needham, Volume 1, 135.</ref> established during the Tang Dynasty. The [[Neo-Confucianism|Neo-Confucian]] [[Donglin Academy]], established in 1111, was founded upon the staunch teaching that adulterant influences of other ideologies such as [[Buddhism]] should not influence the teaching of their purely Confucian school.<ref name="morton 135">Morton, 135.</ref> This belief hearkened back to the writings of the Tang Dynasty essayist and poet [[Han Yu]] (768<U+2013>824), who was certainly a critic of Buddhism and its influence upon Confucian values. Although the [[White Deer Grotto Academy]] of the [[Southern Tang]] (937&ndash;976) period had fallen out of use during the early half of the Song period, the Neo-Confucian philosopher [[Zhu Xi]] (1130&ndash;1200) reinvigorated it. 

Zhu Xi was one of many critics who argued that government schools did not sufficiently encourage personal cultivation of the self and molded students into officials who cared only for profit and salary.<ref name="walton 199"/> Not all social and political philosophers in the Song period blamed the examination system as the root of the problem (but merely as a method of recruitment and selection), emphasizing instead the gentry's failure to take responsibility in society as the cultural elite.<ref name="walton 200">Walton, 200.</ref> Zhu Xi also laid emphasis on the [[Four Books]], a series of Confucian classics that would become the official introduction of education for all Confucian students, yet were initially discarded by his contemporaries.<ref name="ebrey 169">Ebrey, 169.</ref> After his death, his commentary on the Four Books found appeal amongst scholar-officials and in 1241 his writings were adopted as mandatory readings for examination candidates with the support of [[Emperor Lizong of Song|Emperor Lizong]].<ref name="ebrey 169"/><ref name="yuan 201">Yuan, 201.</ref>

==Political partisanship and reform==
{{see|Three Departments and Six Ministries}}
[[Image:SongShenzong.jpg|thumb|left|200px|[[Emperor Shenzong of Song]], the political ally of Wang Anshi who endorsed Wang's reform effort in the economy, military, education system, and social order.]]

During the Song period, the careers of low-grade and middle-grade officials were largely secure; in the high ranks of the central administration, "reverses of fortune were to be feared," as [[Sinology|Sinologist]] historian Jacques Gernet put it.<ref name="gernet 65"/> Lower-grade officials performed the necessary duties of administration such as collecting taxes, overseeing criminal cases, implementing efforts to fight famine and natural calamity, and occasionally supervising market affairs or public works.<ref name="fairbank 104 105">Fairbank, 104&ndash;105.</ref> The incredible growth of China's population far outmatched the total number of officials accepted as administrators in the Song government, so the educated gentry who had not been appointed to an official post were entrusted as supervisors of affairs in rural communities.<ref name="fairbank 106">Fairbank, 106.</ref> It was the "upper gentry" of high-grade officials in the capital<U+2014>comprised mostly of those who passed the palace exams<U+2014>who were in a position to influence and reform society.<ref name="fairbank 102 103">Fairbank, 102&ndash;103.</ref> 

The high echelons of the political scene during the Song Dynasty left a notorious legacy of partisanship and strife among factions of state ministers. The Chancellor [[Fan Zhongyan]] (989<U+2013>1052) introduced a series of reforms between 1043 and 1045 that received heated backlash from the conservative element at court. Fan set out to erase corruption from the recruitment system by providing higher salaries for minor officials, in order to persuade them not to become corrupt and take bribes.<ref name="ebrey 163"/> He also established sponsorship programs that would ensure officials were drafted on their merits, administrative skills, and moral character more than their [[etiquette]] and cultured appearance.<ref name="ebrey 163">Ebrey, 163.</ref>  However, the conservatives at court did not want their career paths and comfortably-set positions jeopardized by new standards, so they rallied to successfully halt the reforms.<ref name="ebrey 163"/>

Inspired by Fan's motivation, the later Chancellor [[Wang Anshi]] (1021<U+2013>1086) implemented a series of reforms starting in 1069. They included a community-based law enforcement and civil order known as the [[Baojia system]]. Wang Anshi attempted to diminish the importance of landholding and private wealth in favor of mutual-responsibility social groups that shared similar values and could be easily controlled by the government.<ref name="fairbank 97">Fairbank, 97.</ref> Just as scholar-officials owed their social prestige to their government degrees, Wang wanted to structure all of society as a mass of dependents loyal to the central government.<ref name="fairbank 97"/> He used various means, including the prohibition of landlords offering loans to tenants; this role was assumed by the government.<ref name="fairbank 97"/> 

[[Image:Wang Anshi.jpg|200px|thumb|Chancellor [[Wang Anshi]] (1021&ndash;1086)]]
Wang established local [[militia]]s that could aid the official standing army and lessen the constrained state budget expenses for the military.<ref name="ebrey 164"/>  He set up low-cost loans for the benefit of rural farmers, whom he viewed as the backbone of the Song economy.<ref name="ebrey 164"/>  Since the land tax exacted from rural farmers filled the state treasury's coffers, Wang implemented a reform to update the land-survey system so that more accurate assessments could be gathered.<ref name="ebrey 164"/>  Wang removed the mandatory poetry requirement in the civil service exams, on the grounds that many otherwise skilled and knowledgeable Confucian students were being denied entry into the administration.<ref name="ebrey 164"/>  Wang also established government monopolies for tea, salt, and wine production.<ref name="ebrey 164"/> All of these programs received heavy criticism from conservative ministerial peers, who believed his reforms damaged local family wealth which provided the basis for the production of examination candidates, managers, merchants, landlords, and other essential members of society.<ref name="fairbank 97"/>

To gain support for his reforms, Wang sought out potential allies and formed a coalition that became known as the [[History of the Song Dynasty#Partisans and factions, reformers and conservatives|New Policies Group]], which in turn emboldened his known political rivals to band together in opposition to him.<ref name="sivin iii 3 4">Sivin, III, 3<U+2013>4.</ref>  After Wang had served as chancellor, the political faction led by the historian and official [[Sima Guang]] (1019&ndash;1086) took control of the central government, allied with the [[empress dowager|dowager Empress]] who acted as [[regent]] over the young [[Emperor Zhezong of Song]]. Wang's new policies were completely reversed, including popular reforms like the tax substitution for [[corv<U+00E9>e]] labor service.<ref name="ebrey 164"/>  When Emperor Zhezong came of age and replaced his grandmother as the state power, he favored Wang's policies and once again instituted the reforms.<ref name="ebrey 165">Ebrey, 165.</ref>  As each political faction gained advantage over the other, ministers of the opposing side were labeled "obstructionist" and were sent out of the capital to govern remote frontier regions of the empire. This form of political exile was not only politically damaging, but could also be physically threatening. Those who fell from favor could be sent to govern areas of the deep south where the deadly disease of [[malaria]] was prevalent.<ref name="ebrey 164"/>

==Family and gender==
===Familial rights and customs===
[[Image:Su Han Ch'en 001.jpg|thumb|right|200px|''Playing Children'', by Song artist Su Hanchen, c. 1150 AD.]]
The [[Chinese philosophy]] of [[Confucius]] (551&ndash;479 BC) and the [[Confucianism|hierarchical social order]] his disciples adhered to had become embedded into mainstream Chinese culture since the reign of [[Emperor Wu of Han]] (r. 141&ndash;87 BC). During the Song Dynasty, the whole of Chinese society was theoretically modelled upon this familial social order of superiors and inferiors.<ref name="gernet 144 145"/> Confucian dogma dictated what was proper moral behavior, and how a superior should regulate rewards or punishments when dealing with an inferior member of society or one's family.<ref name="gernet 144 145">Gernet, 144&ndash;145</ref> This is exemplified in the Tang Dynasty law code, which was largely retained in the Song period.<ref name="gernet 145">Gernet, 145.</ref>  Jacques Gernet writes: "The family relationships supposed to exist in the ideal family were the foundation of the entire moral outlook, and even the law, in its total structure and its scale of penalties, was nothing but a codified expression of them."<ref name="gernet 145"/>

Under the Tang law code, severe punishments were outlined for those who disobeyed or disrespected the hierarchical system of elders. Those who assaulted their parents could be put to death, those who assaulted an older sibling could be put to forced labor, and those who assaulted an older cousin could be sentenced to caning.<ref name="gernet 145"/> A household servant who killed his master could be sentenced to death, while a master who killed his servant would be arrested and forced into a year of hard labor for the state.<ref name="gernet 145"/> Yet this reverence for elders and superiors was grounded in more than just [[secular]] Confucian discourse; Chinese beliefs of [[ancestor worship]] transformed the identity of one's parents into abstract, otherworldly figures.<ref name="gernet 145"/> However, Song society itself was one built upon social relationships governed not by abstract principles, but upon the protection gained by devoting oneself to a superior.<ref name="gernet 146">Gernet, 146.</ref> Likewise, perpetuating the religious family cult with many descendants was coupled with the notion that producing more children offered the family a layer of protection, reinforcing its power in the community.<ref name="gernet 147">Gernet, 147.</ref> More children meant better odds of extending a family's power through marriage alliance with other prominent families, as well as better odds of having a child occupying a prestigious administrative post in government.<ref name="gernet 147 148">Gernet, 147&ndash;148.</ref> No one was better prepared for society than one who gained plenty of experience in dealing with the members of his extended family, as it was common for upper-class families to have several generations living in the same household.<ref name="gernet 144 146">Gernet, 144&ndash;146.</ref> Those who came from noteworthy families were treated with dignity, and a wider family influence meant a better chance for an individual to secure his own fortunes.<ref name="gernet 146"/> One did not even have to share the same blood line in order to create and build more social ties. This could be done by accepting any number of artificial [[blood brother]]s in a ceremony assuring mutual obligations and shared loyalty.<ref name="gernet 146"/>

[[Image:Mao I 001.jpg|thumb|left|210px|''Cats in the Garden'', by Mao Yi, 12th century; family pets in the Song Dynasty included watch dogs whose tails were often docked, long-haired cats for catching rats, cats with yellow-and-white fur called 'lion-cats' (who were valued simply as cute pets), eagles and hawks, and even crickets in cages.<ref name="gernet 48">Gernet, 48.</ref><ref name="gernet 122 123">Gernet, 122&ndash;123.</ref><ref name="west 75">West, 75.</ref> Cats could be pampered with items bought from the market such as 'cat-nests', and were often fed fish that were advertised in the market specifically for cats.<ref name="gernet 48"/><ref name="gernet 122 123"/>]]
In Song society, governed by the largely-unaltered Tang era legal code, the act of [[primogeniture]] was not practiced in Chinese inheritance of property, and in fact was illegal.<ref name="fairbank 83">Fairbank, 83.</ref> When the head of a family died, his offspring equally divided the property.<ref name="fairbank 83"/> This law was implemented in the Tang Dynasty in order to challenge the powerful aristocratic clans of the northwest, and to prevent the rise of a society domineered by landed nobility.<ref name="fairbank 83"/> If an official family did not produce another official within a few generations, the future prospects of that family remaining wealthy and influential became uncertain.<ref name="fairbank 83 84">Fairbank, 83&ndash;84</ref>  Thus, the legal issues of familial inheritance had profound effects upon the rest of society.

When a member of the family died there were varying degrees of prostration and display of piety amongst family members, each one behaving differently according to the custom of kinship association with the deceased.<ref name="gernet 172"/> There was to be no flashy or colorful attire while in the period of mourning, and proper funerary rituals were observed such as cleansing and clothing the deceased to rid him or her of impurities.<ref name="gernet 172"/> This was one of the necessary steps in the observance of the deceased as one of the worshipped ancestors, which in turn raised the prestige of the family.<ref name="gernet 172"/> Funerals were often expensive. A geomancer had to be consulted on where to bury the dead, caterers were hired to furnish the funeral banquet, and there was always the purchase of the coffin, which was burned along with paper images of horses, carriages, and servants in order for them to accompany the deceased into the next life.<ref name="gernet 173">Gernet, 173.</ref> Due to the high cost of burial, most families opted for the cheaper practice of cremation.<ref name="gernet 173"/> This was frowned upon by Confucian officials due to beliefs in the ancestral cult.<ref name="gernet 173"/> They sought to ban the practice with prohibitions in 963 and 972; despite this, cremation amongst the poor and middle classes persisted.<ref name="gernet 173"/> By the 12th century, the government came up with the solution of installing public cemeteries where a family's deceased could be buried on state owned property.<ref name="gernet 173 174">Gernet, 173&ndash;174</ref>

Historians note that women during the Tang Dynasty were brazen, assertive, active, and relatively more socially liberated than Song women.<ref name="ebrey cambridge 160"/> Women of the Song period are typically seen as well educated and interested in expressing themselves through poetry,<ref name="ebrey cambridge 158"/> yet more reserved, respectful, "slender, petite and dainty," according to Gernet.<ref name="ebrey cambridge 160"/><ref name="gernet 166">Gernet, 166.</ref> Evidence of [[foot binding]] as a new trend in the Southern Song period certainly reinforces this notion.<ref name="ebrey cambridge 160 161">Ebrey, ''Cambridge Illustrated History of China'', 160<U+2013>161.</ref> However, the greater number of documents due to more widespread printing reveal a much more complex and rich reality about family life and Song women.<ref name="ebrey cambridge 158">Ebrey, ''Cambridge Illustrated History of China'', 158.</ref> Through written stories, legal cases, and other documents, many different sources show that Song women held considerable clout in family decision-making, and some were quite economically saavy.<ref name="ebrey cambridge 158 160">Ebrey, ''Cambridge Illustrated History of China'', 158&ndash;160.</ref><ref name="gernet 165">Gernet, 165.</ref>  Men dominated the public sphere, while affluent wives spent most of their time indoors enjoying leisure activities and managing the household.<ref name="gernet 165"/> However, women of the lower and middle classes were not solely bound to the domestic sphere.<ref name="ebrey cambridge 158"/><ref name="gernet 165"/> It was common for women to manage town inns, some to manage restaurants, farmers' daughters to weave mats and sell them on their own behalf, midwives to deliver babies, Buddhist nuns to study religious texts and sutras, female nurses to assist physicians, and women to keep a close eye on their own financial affairs.<ref name="ebrey 170">Ebrey et al., 170.</ref><ref name="gernet 165"/> In the case of the latter, legal case documents describe childless widows who accused their nephews of stealing their property.<ref name="ebrey 170"/> There are also numerous mentions of women drawing upon their dowries to help their husband's sisters marry into other prominent families.<ref name="ebrey 170"/> 

The economic prosperity of the Song period prompted many families to provide their daughters with larger [[dowry|dowries]] in order to attract the wealthiest sons-in-law to provide a stable life of economic security for their daughters.<ref name="ebrey cambridge 160">Ebrey, ''Cambridge Illustrated History of China'', 160.</ref> With large amounts of property allotted to a daughter's dowry, her family naturally sought benefits; as a result women's legal claims to property were greatly improved.<ref name="ebrey cambridge 160"/> Daughters and sons had equal opportunity to inherit property.<ref name="China"/> Under the Song law code, if an heirless man left no clear successor to his property and household, it was his widowed wife's right to designate her own heir in a process called ''liji'' ("adopting an heir").<ref name="bernhardt 274">Bernhardt, 274.</ref> If an heir was appointed by the parents' relatives after their deaths, the "appointed" heir did not have the same rights as a biological son to inherit the estate; instead he shared ''juehu'' ("extinct household") property with the parents' daughter(s), if any.<ref name="bernhardt 274 275">Bernhardt, 274<U+2013>275.</ref>  Divorcing a spouse was permissible if there was mutual consent between husband and wife,<ref name="gernet 163">Gernet, 163.</ref> while remarriage after the death of a spouse was common during the Song period.<ref name="ebrey 171"/> However, widows under post-Song dynasties did not often remarry, following the ethic of the Confucian philosopher [[Cheng Yi (philosopher)|Cheng Yi]] (1033&ndash;1107), who stated that it was better for a widow to die than lose her virtue by remarrying.<ref name="ebrey 171"/> Widows remarrying another after the death of a first spouse did not become common again until the late [[Qing Dynasty]] (1644&ndash;1912), yet such an action was still regarded as morally inferior.<ref>Friedman et al., 7.</ref>

Despite advances in relative social freedoms and legal rights, women were still expected to attend to the duties of the home. Along with child-rearing, women were responsible for spinning yarn, weaving cloth, sewing clothing, and cooking meals.<ref name="ebrey 170"/> Women who belonged to families that sold silk were especially busy, since their duties included coddling the [[silkworm]]s, feeding them chopped [[mulberry]] tree leaves, and keeping them warm to ensure that they would eventually spin their cocoons.<ref name="ebrey 170"/> In the family pecking order, the dominant female of the household was the mother-in-law, who was free to hand out orders and privileges to the wives of her sons. Mothers often had strong ties with their grown and married sons, since these men often stayed at home.<ref name="ebrey cambridge 158"/> If a mother-in-law could not find sufficient domestic help from the daughters-in-law, there was a market for women to be bought as maids or servants.<ref name="ebrey 160"/> There were also many professional [[courtesan]]s (and concubines brought into the house) who kept men busy in the pursuits of entertainment, relations, and romantic affairs.<ref name="ebrey cambridge 158 160"/> It was also common for wives to be jealous and conniving towards [[concubine]]s that their wealthy husbands brought home.<ref name="ebrey 170"/> Yet two could play at this game. The ideal of the chaste, modest, and pious young woman was somewhat distorted in urban settings such as Hangzhou and [[Suzhou]], where there were greedy and flirtatious women, as one author put it.<ref name="gernet 164"/> This author stated that the husbands of these women could not satisfy them, and so took on as many as five 'complementary husbands'; if they lived close to a monastery, even Buddhist monks could suffice for additional lovers.<ref name="gernet 164">Gernet, 164.</ref>
 
Although boys were taught at Confucian academies for the ultimate goal of government service, girls were often taught by their brothers how to read and write. By Song times, more women of the upper and educated classes were able to read due to advances in widespread printing, leaving behind a treasury of letters, poems, and other documents penned by women.<ref name="ebrey cambridge 158"/> Some women were educated enough to teach their sons before they were sent to an official school.<ref name="ebrey cambridge 158"/> For example, the mother of the statesman and scientist Shen Kuo taught him basic education and even [[military strategy]] that she had learned from her elder brother.<ref name="sivin iii 1">Sivin, III, 1.</ref> Hu Wenrou, a granddaughter of a famous Song official Hu Su, was regarded by Shen Kuo as a remarkable female mathematician, as Shen would occasionally relay questions to Hu Wenrou through her husband in order for her to review and investigate possible errors in his mathematical work.<ref>Tao et al., 19.</ref> [[Li Qingzhao]] (1084&ndash;1151), whose father was a friend of Su Shi, wrote many poems throughout her often turbulent life (only about 100 of these survive) and became a renowned poet during her lifetime.<ref name="ebrey 171"/><ref name="ebrey cambridge 158"/> After the death of her husband, she wrote poems profusely about poring over his paintings, calligraphy, and ancient bronze vessels, as well as poems with deep emotional longing:

{{main|Religion in China}}
[[Image:Liu Songnian, Luohan.jpg|150px|thumb|''[[Arhat|A Luohan]]'', by Liu Songnian, late 12th-early 13th century, Southern Song.]]
Ancient Chinese [[Taoism|Daoism]], [[ancestor worship]], and foreign-originated [[Buddhism]] were the most prominent religious practices in the Song period. Daoism developed largely from the teachings of the ''[[Tao Te Ching|Daodejing]]'', attributed to the 6th-century BC philosopher [[Laozi]] ("Old Master"), considered one of the [[Three Pure Ones]] (the prime deities of Daoism). Buddhism in China, introduced by [[Yuezhi]], [[An Shih Kao|Persian]], and [[Kushan]] missionaries in the first and second centuries, gradually became more native in character and was transformed into distinct [[Chinese Buddhism]]. 

Many followed the teachings of Buddha and prominent monks such as [[Dahui Zonggao]] (1089&ndash;1163) and [[Wuzhun Shifan]] (1178&ndash;1249). However, there were also many critics of Buddhism's religious and philosophical tenets. This included the ardent nativist, scholar, and statesman Ouyang Xiu, who called Buddhism a "curse" upon China, an alien tradition that infiltrated the native beliefs of his country while at its weakest during the [[Southern and Northern Dynasties]] (420&ndash;581).<ref name="wright 88">Wright, 88.</ref>  Although conservative proponents of native Confucianism were highly skeptical of the teachings of Buddhism and often sought to distance themselves from it, others used Buddhist teachings to bolster their own Confucian philosophy. The Neo-Confucian philosophers and brothers Cheng Hao and Cheng Yi of the 11th century sought philosophical explanations for the workings of principle (li) and vital energy ([[qi]]) in nature, responding to the notions of highly complex [[metaphysic]]s in popular Buddhist thought.<ref name="ebrey 168">Ebrey, 168.</ref>  Neo-Confucian scholars also sought to borrow the [[Mahayana]] Buddhist ideal of self-sacrifice, welfare, and charity embodied in the [[bodhisattva]].<ref name="wright 93">Wright, 93.</ref>  Seeking to replace the Buddhist monastery's once prominent role in societal welfare and charity, supporters of Neo-Confucianism converted this ideal into practical measures of state-sponsored support for the poor under a secular mission of ethical [[universalism]].<ref name="wright 93 94">Wright, 93<U+2013>94.</ref>  
[[Image:Qiu Chuji.jpg|150px|left|thumb|Painting of [[Qiu Chuji]] (1148<U+2013>1227), a follower of the [[Quanzhen School]] of Daoism who founded the Longmen ("Dragon Gate") branch of Daoism.]] 
Buddhism never fully recovered after [[Four Buddhist Persecutions in China|several major persecutions in China]] from the 5th through the 10th centuries, although Daoism continued to thrive in Song China. In northern China under the [[Jin Dynasty (1115<U+2013>1234)|Jin Dynasty]] after 1127, the Daoist philosopher [[Wang Chongyang]] (1113&ndash;1170) established the [[Quanzhen School]]. Wang's seven disciples, known as the Seven Immortals, gained great fame throughout China. They included the prominent Daoist priestess [[Sun Bu'er]] (c. 1119&ndash;1182), who became a female role model in Daoism. There was also [[Qiu Chuji]] (1148&ndash;1227), who founded his own Quanzhen Daoist branch known as Longmen ("Dragon Gate").

[[Chinese folk religion]] continued as a tradition in China, drawing upon aspects of both ancient [[Chinese mythology]] and ancestor worship. Many people believed that spirits and deities of the spirit realm regularly interacted with the realm of the living. This subject was popular in Song literature. Hong Mai (1123&ndash;1202), a prominent member of an official family from [[Jiangxi]], wrote a popular book called ''The Record of the Listener'', which had many anecdotes dealing with the spirit realm and people's supposed interactions with it.<ref name="ebrey 172">Ebrey, 172.</ref>  People in Song China believed that many of their daily misfortunes and blessings were caused by an array of different deities and spirits who interfered with their daily lives.<ref name="ebrey 172"/>  These deities included the nationally accepted deities of Buddhism and Daoism, as well as the local deities and demons from specific geographic locations.<ref name="ebrey 172"/>  If one displeased a long-dead relative, the dissatisfied ancestor would allegedly inflict natural ailments and illnesses.<ref name="ebrey 172"/> People also believed in mischievous demons and malevolent spirits who had the capability to extort sacrificial offerings meant for ancestors <U+2013> in essence these were bullies of the spiritual realm.<ref name="ebrey 172"/>  The Chinese believed that spirits and deities had the same emotions and drives as the living did.<ref name="ebrey 172 174"/>  In some cases the chief deity of a local town or city was believed to act as a municipal official who could receive and dispatch orders on how to punish or reward spirits.<ref name="ebrey 172 174">Ebrey, 172<U+2013>174.</ref>  Residents of cities offered many sacrifices to their divinities in hopes that their city would be spared from disasters such as fire.<ref name="gernet 38">Gernet, 38.</ref> However, not only common people felt the need to appease local deities. Magistrates and officials sent from the capital to various places of the empire often had to ensure the locals that his authority was supported by the local deity.<ref name="waton 202">Walton, 202.</ref>

==Justice and law==
[[Image:BaoZheng.jpg|right|thumb|A bust of the famous [[magistrate]] [[Bao Qingtian]] (999<U+2013>1062), renowned for his judgment in court justice during the early Song era.]]
{{see|Traditional Chinese law}}
One of the duties of scholar-officials was hearing judicial cases in court. However, the magistrates and prefects of the Song period were expected to know more than just the written laws.<ref name="ebrey 161">Ebrey, 161.</ref> They were expected to promote morality in society, to punish the wicked, and carefully recognize in their sentences which party in a court case was truly at fault.<ref name="ebrey 161"/> It was often the most serious cases that came before the court; most people desired to settle legal quarrels privately, since court preparations were expensive.<ref name="gernet 107"/> In ancient China, criminals were guilty until proven innocent, the reverse of modern jurisprudence.<ref name="gernet 107"/> The accused were immediately put in filthy jails and nourished only by the efforts of friends and relatives.<ref name="gernet 107">Gernet, 107.</ref> Even those who made accusations were viewed with suspicion by the judge.<ref name="gernet 107"/>  

Gernet points out that disputes requiring arrest were mostly avoided or settled privately. Yet historian Patricia Ebrey states that legal cases in the Song period portrayed the courts as being overwhelmed with cases of neighbors and relatives suing each other over property rights.<ref name="ebrey cambridge 155">Ebrey, ''Cambridge Illustrated History of China'', 155.</ref> The Song Dynasty author and official [[Yuan Cai]] (1140&ndash;1190) repeatedly warned against this, and like other officials of his time also cautioned his readers about the rise of banditry in Southern Song society and a need to physically protect self and property.<ref name="ebrey cambridge 155"/>

===Court cases===
{{see|Bao Qingtian}}
Many Song court cases serve as examples for the promotion of morality in society, which in the [[Western Europe|West]] is called the doctrine of [[equity (law)|equity]]. Using his knowledge and understanding of townsmen and farmers, one Song Dynasty judge made this ruling in the case of two brawling fishermen, who were labeled as Pan 52 and Li 7 by the court:

<blockquote>Competition in Selling Fish Resulted in Assaults</blockquote>
[[Image:Qingming Festival Detail 16.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A gated entrance to a jail; notice the spikes on the wall to deter escapees or unlawful entry; detail from a [[Along the River During Qingming Festival|famous cityscape handscroll painting]] by artist [[Zhang Zeduan]] (1085&ndash;1145).]]
<blockquote>A proclamation: In the markets of the city the profits from commerce are monopolized by itinerant loiterers, while the little people from the rural villages are not allowed to sell their wares. There is not a single necessity of our clothing or food that is not the product of the fields of these old rustics. The men plow and the women weave. Their toil is extremely wearisome, yet what they gain from it is negligible, while manifold interest returns to these lazy idlers. This sort, in tens and hundreds, come together to form gangs. When the villagers come to sell things in the market place, before the goods have even left their hands, this crowd of idlers arrives and attacks them, assaulting them as a group. These idlers call this "the boxing of the community family." They are not at all afraid to act outrageously. I have myself seen that it is like this. Have they not given thought to the foodstuffs they require and the clothing they wear? Is it produced by these people of the marketplaces? Or is it produced by the rural farmers? When they recognize that these goods are produced by the farming people or the rural villages, how can they look at them in anger? How can they bully and insult them? Now, Pan Fifty-two and Li Seven are both fishmongers, but Pan lives in the city and fishmongering is his source of livelihood. Li Seven is a farmer, who does fishmongering between busy times. Pan Fifty-two at the end of the year has his profit, without having had the labor of raising the fish, but simply earning it from the selling of the fish. He hated Li and fought with him at the fish market. His lack of humanity is extreme! Li Seven is a village rustic. How could he fight with the itinerant armed loiterers who hang around the marketplace? Although no injuries resulted from the fight, we still must mete out some slight punishments. Pan Fifty-two is to be beaten fifteen blows with the heavy rod. In addition, Li Seven, although he is a village farmer, was still verbally abusive while the two men were stubbornly arguing. He clearly is not a man of simple and pure character. He must have done something to provoke this dispute. Li Seven is to be given a suspended sentence of a beating of ten blows, to be carried out if hereafter there are further violations.<ref name="ebrey 161"/></blockquote>

[[Image:Chinesischer Maler des 12. Jahrhunderts (II) 001.jpg|right|thumb|240px|''The Broken Balustrade'', a 12th century painting showing two armed palace guards (on the left) making an arrest.]]
In the Song Dynasty, sheriffs were employed to investigate and apprehend suspected criminals, determining from the crime scene and evidence found on the body if the cause of death was disease, old age, an accident, or foul play.<ref name="mcknight 155 157">McKnight, 155<U+2013>157.</ref>  If murder was considered the cause, an official from the prefecture was sent to investigate and draw up a formal [[inquest]], to be signed by witnesses and used in court.<ref name="mcknight 155 156">McKnight, 155<U+2013>156.</ref>  The documents of this inquest also included sketches of human bodies with details of where and what injuries were inflicted.<ref name="mcknight 156 157">McKnight, 156<U+2013>157.</ref>

[[Song Ci]] (1186&ndash;1249) was a Chinese physician and judge during the Southern Song Dynasty. His famous work ''[[Collected Cases of Injustice Rectified]]'' was a basis for early [[forensic science]] in China. Song's predecessor Shen Kuo offered critical analysis of human anatomy, dispelling the old Chinese belief that the human throat had three valves instead of two.<ref name="sivin III 30-31">Sivin, III, 30<U+2013>31.</ref> A Chinese autopsy in the early 12th century confirmed Shen's hypothesis of two throat valves: the [[esophagus]] and [[larynx]].<ref name="sivin III 30-31 footnote">Sivin, III, 30<U+2013>31, footnote 27.</ref>  However, dissection and examination of human bodies for solving criminal cases was of interest to Song Ci. His work was compiled on the basis of other Chinese works dealing with justice and forensics.<ref name="gernet 170">Gernet, 170.</ref> His book provided a list of types of death (strangulation, drowning, poison, blows, etc.) and a means of physical examination in order to distinguish between murder, suicide, or accident.<ref name="gernet 170"/> Besides instructions on proper ways to examine corpses, Song Ci also provided instructions on providing first aid for victims close to death from hanging, drowning, [[hyperthermia|sunstroke]], freezing to death, and [[malnutrition|undernourishment]].<ref name="gernet 170 171">Gernet, 170<U+2013>171.</ref> For the specific case of drowning, Song Ci advised using the first aid technique of [[artificial respiration]].<ref name="gernet 171">Gernet, 171.</ref> He wrote of examinations of victims' bodies performed in the open amongst official clerks and attendants, a coroner's assistant (or [[midwife]] in the case of women),<ref>A Coroner's assistant presided over the autopsy of men, while the midwife presided over woman.</ref> actual accused suspect of the crime and relatives of the deceased, with the results of the autopsy called out loud to the group and noted in the inquest report.<ref name="sung 12">Sung, 12.</ref>  Song Ci wrote:

<blockquote>In all doubtful and difficult inquests, as well as when influential families are involved in the dispute, [the deputed official] must select reliable and experienced coroner<U+2019>s assistants and Recorders of good character who are circumspect and self-possessed to accompany him. [. . .] Call a brief halt and wait for the involved parties to arrive. Otherwise, there will be requests for private favors. Supposing an examination is held to get the facts, the clerks will sometimes accept bribes to alter the reports of the affair. If the officials and clerks suffer for their crimes, that is a minor matter. But, if the facts are altered, the judicial abuse may cost someone his life. Factual accuracy is supremely important.<ref name="sung 72">Sung, 72.</ref></blockquote>

Song Ci also shared his opinion that having the accused suspect of the murder present at the autopsy of his victim, in close proximity to the grieving relatives of the deceased, was a very powerful psychological tool for the authorities to gain confessions.<ref name="sung 19 20">Sung, 19<U+2013>20.</ref>  Although interests in human anatomy had a long tradition in the [[Western world]], a forensic book such as Song Ci's did not appear in Western works until Roderic de Castro's book in the 17th century.<ref name="gernet 170"/> There have been several modern books published about Song Ci's writing and translations of it into English. This includes W.A. Harland's ''Records of Washing away of Injuries'' (1855), [[Herbert Giles]]' ''The Hsi Yuan Lu, or Instructions to Coroners'' (1924), and Dr. Brian E. McKnight's ''The Washing Away of Wrongs: Forensic Medicine in Thirteenth-Century China'' (1981).

During the Song Dynasty, for those without formal education, the quickest way to power and the upper echelons of society was to join the military.<ref name="lorge 43">Lorge, 43.</ref>  If a man had a successful career in the military and could boast of victorious battles, he had a sure path to success in politics.<ref name="lorge 43"/>  Exam-drafted scholar-officials came mostly from prominent families and could rely on their clan status to advance their careers and place in society. Many Song military officers did not have this advantage, and owed their status in society to the advantage that military power granted them.<ref name="lorge 43"/>  Many court [[eunuch]]s such as [[Tong Guan]] (1054&ndash;1126) were eager to enlist as officers in the central army since this was a means to elevate their position at court.<ref name="ebrey 166">Ebrey, 166.</ref>

Ordinary soldiers were merely recruited or conscripted rural farmers, while surrendered bandits and mercenaries also joined the military.<ref name="fairbank 109">Fairbank 109.</ref> Soldiers were not awarded official status by Confucian scholars as belonging to one of the Four Occupations; the scholar-officials were wary of condoning or legitimizing those whose lives revolved around the uncivilized practices of ''wu'' (violence).<ref name="fairbank 109"/> Even though the military examinations, rankings, and posts were parallel to those of the civil order, scholar-officials and the gentry nonetheless viewed military pursuits as uncultivated.<ref name="fairbank 109 111">Fairbank, 109&ndash;111.</ref> Despite this disdain and argument of moral high ground, scholar-officials often commanded troops and wielded military power.<ref name="fairbank 109"/> Yet scholar-officials were not at the apex of the military or even civilian order; at the pinnacle of society was the emperor.<ref name="fairbank 110 111">Fairbank, 110&ndash;111.</ref> The emperor's use of violence was seen as a necessity to reign in rebellious elements of society and dominate violent and uncultivated [[Central Asia|Inner Asian]] tribes, who would then submit to the emperor and become transformed by China's superior ''wen'' (culture and civilization).<ref>Fairbank, 111&ndash;112.</ref>

===Catastrophe and reforms===
In the year 960 the Song military had 378,000 enlisted soldiers.<ref name="gernet 72"/> Around the turn of the 11th century its size had grown to 900,000 soldiers, increasing to 1,000,000 by the year 1022, and well over 1,250,000 by 1041.<ref name="ebrey 164">Ebrey, 164.</ref><ref name="ebrey cambridge 138">Ebrey, ''Cambridge Illustrated History of China'', 138.</ref><ref name="gernet 72">Gernet, 72.</ref>  The overall expenses of upholding a military of this size consumed three-quarters of the state's entire annual revenue.<ref name="ebrey cambridge 138"/> To lessen the expense, in 1069 the Chancellor Wang Anshi created the institution of local militias as supporting units.<ref name="ebrey 164"/>  In 1073, Wang Anshi created a new bureau of the central government called the Directorate of Weapons, which supervised the manufacture of armaments and ensured quality control.<ref name="peers 130">Peers, 130.</ref>

[[Image:China 11a.jpg|thumb|right|160px|Northern Song]]
[[Image:China 11b.jpg|thumb|right|160px|Southern Song]]
Despite the size of the army and these beneficial reforms, the high ranks of Song military command were heavily corrupt. At the beginning of the 12th century, Song generals collected funds based on the number of troops they recorded; instead of using the funds to benefit troops, they used this money to bolster their own salaries.<ref name="lorge 41">Lorge, 41.</ref>  Troops of the standing army, meanwhile, were given very small salaries while assigned tasks of menial labor.<ref name="graff 26">Graff, 26.</ref>  The scholar-officials running the government often paid little attention to the plight of soldiers and even to the demands of officers, since they were seen as being on a lower tier in society.<ref name="graff 25 26">Graff, 25<U+2013>26</ref> Fairbank writes that the "civilian domination of the military was part of the ruling elite's control of the state, but it left the state military weak."<ref name="fairbank 109"/> 

The corruption of the high command and ineffectiveness of military strength was soon revealed once the Song made a joint effort with the [[Jurchen]] people to conquer the [[Khitan people|Khitan]] [[Liao Dynasty]]. After the successful rebellion of the Jurchens against their Khitan masters, the Jurchen observed the weakness of the Song army and broke their pact, then attacked Song as well. By 1127, the capital at Kaifeng was captured and northern China overrun, while the remnants of the Song court fled south to Hangzhou and established the Southern Song. This was a crucial blow to the Song military elites, as they had been closely tied to the political structure until 1127; afterwards they became alienated from the emperor and the Song court.<ref name="lorge 44">Lorge, 44.</ref> Although they had lost northern China to the new Jurchen [[Jin Dynasty (1115<U+2013>1234)|Jin Dynasty]] (1115&ndash;1234), this loss prompted the Song to make drastic and lasting military reforms. [[Emperor Gaozong of Song]] (r. 1127&ndash;1162), desperate to refill the decimated ranks of the central army, drafted men from all over the country.<ref name="lorge 42"/> This had been done before, but not on the same scale. Only the most skilled became imperial guardsmen, while under Gaozong entire central army units were composed of soldiers from every region and background.<ref name="lorge 42">Lorge, 42.</ref> The Southern Song eventually recovered their strength and commanded the loyalty of vaunted commanders such as [[Yue Fei]] (1103&ndash;1142), who successfully defended the border at the [[Huai River]]. The Jurchens and Song eventually signed a peace treaty in 1141.<ref name="lorge 41"/>

In 1131, the Chinese writer Zhang Yi noted the importance of employing a navy to fight the Jin, writing that China had to regard the sea and the river as her [[Great Wall of China|Great Wall]], and use warships as its greatest watchtowers.<ref name="needham volume 4 part 3 476"/> Although the use of [[Naval history of China|navies in China]] had been done since the ancient [[Spring and Autumn Period]] (722&ndash;481 BC),<ref name="needham volume 4 part 3 678">Needham, Volume 4, Part 3, 678</ref> in the year 1132 the Southern Song established China's first permanent standing navy.<ref name="needham volume 4 part 3 476">Needham, Volume 4, Part 3, 476.</ref>  The Jurchen launched an invasion against the Southern Song along the length of the [[Yangtze River]], which resulted in two crucial Song victories at the [[Battle of Caishi]] and [[Battle of Tangdao]] in 1161. The Jin navy was effectively defeated by the Song's standing navy, which employed [[trebuchet]]s on their ships' top deckhouses which launched [[gunpowder]] bombs.<ref name="needham volume 5 part 7 155">Needham, Volume 5, Part 7, 155</ref><ref name="needham volume 5 part 7 166">Needham, Volume 5, Part 7, 166.</ref>

===Organization and equipment===

In the Song Dynasty, infantry units were organized 50 men to a [[platoon]], two platoons to a [[Company (military unit)|company]], and those into [[battalion]]s of 500 men each.<ref name="lorge 45">Lorge, 45.</ref><ref name="peers 130"/>  During the Northern Song Dynasty, half of the entire army of 1 million was stationed in and around Kaifeng.<ref name="lorge 45"/>  The remaining troops were posted in scattered forces along borders and near large municipalities, and in peacetime were used as means to maintain local security.<ref name="lorge 45"/>  Although the Song military was rife with corruption and largely ignored by civil officials, it did provide some valuable strengths to the empire. During the Song era, [[Military parade|military drills]] and [[Military education and training|training]] were studied as a science, while elite soldiers were allocated different responsibilities based on examinations of their skills in weaponry and athletic ability.<ref name="peers 129"/>  In their training, soldiers and officers were prepared for battle by following signal standards for troop movement, advancing when a flag or banner was raised, halting when the blaring sound of bells and drums rang out.<ref name="peers 130"/>  

Song [[crossbow]]men comprised their own separate units apart from the infantry, and according to the Chinese ''[[Wujing Zongyao]]'' military manuscript of 1044, the crossbow used in mass was the most effective weapon used against northern nomadic cavalry charges.<ref name="peers 130"/>  Elite crossbowmen were also valued as long-range [[sniper]]s; such was the case when the Liao Dynasty general Xiao Talin was picked off by a Song crossbow at the Battle of Shanzhou in 1004.<ref name="peers 130"/>  Crossbows were mass produced in state armories with designs improving as time went on, such as the use of a mulberry wood and brass crossbow in 1068 that could pierce a tree at 140 paces.<ref name="peers 130 131">Peers, 130<U+2013>131.</ref>  Song cavalry used an array of different weapons, including halberds, swords, bows, and [[fire lance]]s that discharged a gunpowder blast of flame and [[shrapnel]].<ref name="peers 131">Peers, 131.</ref> In preparation for war, government armories manufactured weapons in enormous quantities, with tens of millions of arrowheads crafted each year, along with armor components by the tens of thousands.<ref name="ebrey cambridge 138"/> There were sixteen known varieties of [[catapult]]s in the Song period, designed to fit many different proportions and requiring work crews in sizes ranging from dozens to several hundred men.<ref name="gernet 72"/>

Unlike many other Chinese dynasties throughout history, the Song Dynasty did not model its military infrastructure and organization on the precedent of northern [[nomad]]ic armies, such as the earlier [[Xianbei]] and later [[Mongol]]s.<ref name="graff 26"/>  Only twice in the Song era were non-Chinese people employed in Song cavalry units: in the beginning of the dynasty with the campaigns of Emperor Taizu, and later 13th century Mongol defectors who came over to fight for the Song.<ref name="peers 131"/>  With the Khitan and Tangut kingdoms possessing much of the pasture and grazing lands in the north, the Song Dynasty military had a shortage of [[Horses in warfare|horses for cavalry]].<ref name="peers 129">Peers, 129.</ref>  Still, the Song established considerably large navies: in the 10th century, in the war to reunite China, and then a standing navy in the 12th century. Many of the warships in the Song Dynasty's navy were [[Paddle steamer|paddle-wheel driven crafts]] and some Song naval ships could carry up to 1,000 soldiers.<ref name="graff 86 87">Graff, 86<U+2013>87.</ref>  It was also during the Song period that naval ships were first armed with gunpowder weapons.<ref name="graff 87">Graff, 87.</ref>  The use of enormous [[pontoon bridge]]s in the Song era on at least one occasion was essential to victory. The Song built a large floating bridge across the Yangtze River in 974; while troops were under attack, the pontoon bridge was used as a means of transport for troops and supplies to the other bank during the early Song conquest of the [[Southern Tang]] state.<ref name="graff 87"/>
