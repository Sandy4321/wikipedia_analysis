'''HMS ''Hermes''''' was an [[aircraft carrier]] built for the [[Royal Navy]]. The ship was begun during [[World War I]] and finished after the war ended. She was the world's first ship to be designed and built as an aircraft carrier, although the [[Imperial Japanese Navy]]'s {{ship|Japanese aircraft carrier|H<U+014D>sh<U+014D>||2}} was the first to be commissioned.<ref>Milanovich, pp. 9, 13</ref> The ship's construction was delayed by multiple changes in her design after she was [[Keel|laid down]]. After she was [[Ship naming and launching|launched]], her shipyard closed and her construction was suspended. Most of the changes were made to optimise her design in light of the results of experiments with the existing carriers.

Commissioned in 1924, ''Hermes'' served briefly with the [[Atlantic Fleet (United Kingdom)|Atlantic Fleet]] before spending the bulk of her career assigned to the [[Mediterranean Fleet]] and the [[China Station]]. In the Mediterranean, she worked with other carriers developing multi-carrier tactics.  While [[wikt:showing the flag|showing the flag]] at the China Station, she helped to suppress pirates in Chinese waters. ''Hermes'' returned home in 1937 and was placed in [[Reserve fleet|reserve]] before becoming a [[training ship]] in 1938.

When [[World War II]] began in September 1939, the ship was briefly assigned to the [[Home Fleet]] and conducted anti-submarine patrols in the [[Western Approaches]]. She was transferred to [[Dakar]] in October to cooperate with the [[French Navy]] in hunting down German [[commerce raider]]s and [[blockade runner]]s. Aside from a brief refit, ''Hermes'' remained there until [[Vichy France]] was established at the end of June 1940. Supported by several cruisers, the ship then blockaded Dakar and attempted to sink the {{ship|French battleship|Richelieu}} by exploding [[depth charge]]s underneath her [[stern]], as well as sending [[Fairey Swordfish]] [[torpedo bomber]]s to attack her at night. While returning from this mission, ''Hermes'' rammed a British [[armed merchant cruiser]] in a storm and required several months of repairs in [[South Africa]], then resumed patrolling for Axis shipping in the South Atlantic and the Indian Ocean.

In February 1941, the ship supported [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] forces in [[Italian Somaliland]] during the [[East African Campaign (World War II)|East African Campaign]] and did much the same two months later in the [[Persian Gulf]] during the [[Anglo-Iraqi War]]. After that campaign, ''Hermes'' spent most of the rest of the year patrolling the Indian Ocean. She refitted in South Africa between November 1941 and February 1942 and then joined the [[Eastern Fleet]] at [[Ceylon]]. After the [[Easter Sunday Raid|raid on Colombo]] on 5 April by the Japanese, ''Hermes'' was sent to [[Trincomalee]], but had left the harbour when the Japanese attacked it on 9 April. She was spotted near [[Batticaloa]] by a Japanese scout plane and attacked by several dozen [[dive bomber]]s shortly afterwards. The carrier and her escorting [[destroyer]] were quickly sunk by the Japanese aircraft. Most of the survivors were rescued by a nearby hospital ship although 307 men from ''Hermes'' were lost in the sinking.

==Development==
Like ''H<U+014D>sh<U+014D>'', ''Hermes'' was based on a cruiser-type hull, and she was initially designed to carry both wheeled aircraft and [[seaplane]]s. The ship's design was derived from a 1916 seaplane carrier design by Gerard Holmes and Sir John Biles, but was considerably enlarged by [[Sir Eustace Tennyson d'Eyncourt, 1st Baronet|Sir Eustace d'Eyncourt]], the [[Director of Naval Construction]] (DNC), in his April 1917 sketch design. Her most notable feature was the seaplane [[slipway]] that comprised three sections. The seaplanes would taxi onto the rigid submerged portion aft and dock with a trolley that would carry the aircraft into the hangar. A flexible submerged portion separated the rear section from the rigid forward portion of the slipway to prevent the submerged part from rolling with the ship's motion. The entire slipway could be retracted into the ship, and a [[gantry crane]] ran the length of the slipway to help recover the seaplanes. The design showed two [[Glossary of nautical terms#I|islands]] with the full-length [[flight deck]] running between them. Each island contained one [[funnel (ship)|funnel]]; a large net could be strung between them to stop out-of-control aircraft. Aircraft were transported between the hangar and the flight deck by two [[Elevator#Aircraft_elevators|aircraft lifts]] (elevators); the forward lift measured {{convert|30|by|30|ft|m|1}} and the rear {{convert|60|by|18|ft|m|1}}. This design displaced {{convert|9000|LT}} and accommodated six large [[Short Type 184]] seaplanes and six smaller [[Sopwith Baby]] seaplanes. The ship's armament consisted of six {{convert|4|in|0|adj=on}} guns.<ref>Friedman, pp. 62<U+2013>63, 67<U+2013>68, 71<U+2013>72, 83</ref>

The DNC produced a detailed design in January 1918 that made some changes to his original sketch, including the addition of a rotating bow [[aircraft catapult|catapult]] to allow the ship to launch aircraft regardless of wind direction, and the ship was laid down that month to the revised design. Progress was slow, as most of the resources of the shipyard were being used to finish the conversion of {{HMS|Eagle|1918|2}} from a battleship to an aircraft carrier. The leisurely pace of construction allowed for more time with which to rework the ship's design. By mid-June the slipway had been deleted from the design and the ship's armament had been revised to consist of eleven {{convert|6|in|adj=on|0}} guns and only a single anti-aircraft gun. By this time, the uncertainty about the best configuration for an aircraft carrier had increased to the point that the Admiralty forbade the builder from working above the hangar deck without express permission. Later that year the ship's design was revised again to incorporate a single island, her lifts were changed to a uniform size of {{convert|44|by|20|ft|m|1}}, and her armament was altered to ten 6-inch guns and four 4-inch anti-aircraft guns. These changes increased her displacement to {{convert|10,110|LT}}.<ref name=f3>Friedman, p. 73</ref>

Construction was suspended after ''Hermes'' was launched in September 1919 as the Admiralty awaited the results of flight trials with ''Eagle'' and {{HMS|Argus|I49|2}}. Her design was modified in March 1920 with an island superstructure and funnel to starboard, and the forward catapult was removed.<ref name=m1>McCart, p. 11</ref> The logic behind placing the island to starboard was that pilots generally preferred to turn to port when recovering from an aborted landing.<ref>Friedman, p. 76</ref> A prominent tripod mast was added to house the [[fire-control system]]s for her guns.<ref name=m1/>

The last revisions were made to the ship's design in May 1921, after the trials with ''Argus'' and ''Eagle''. The lifts were moved further apart to allow for more space for the arresting gear and they were enlarged to allow the wings of her aircraft to be spread in the hangar. Her anti-ship armament was reduced to six {{convert|5.5|in|adj=on|0}} guns and her flight deck was [[Glossary_of_nautical_terms#F|faired]] into the bow.<ref>Friedman, pp. 83<U+2013>84</ref>

===Description===
''Hermes'' had an [[length overall|overall length]] of {{convert|600|ft|m|1}}, a beam of {{convert|70|ft|3|in|m|1}}, and a [[draft (ship)|draught]] of {{convert|23|ft|3|in|m|1}} at [[deep load]]. She displaced {{convert|10,850|LT}} at [[Standard_displacement#Standard_displacement|standard load]].<ref>Friedman, pp. 365<U+2013>66</ref> Each of the ship's two sets of [[Parsons Marine Steam Turbine Company|Parsons]] geared [[steam turbine]]s drove one [[propeller shaft]] at a speed of {{convert|25|kn|lk=in}}.<ref name=m1/> Steam was supplied by six [[Yarrow Shipbuilders|Yarrow]] [[water-tube boiler|boilers]]<ref name=gg1>Gardiner and Gray, p. 71</ref> operating at a pressure of {{convert|235|psi|kPa kg/cm2|0|abbr=on|lk=on}}.<ref name=m1/> The turbines were designed for a total of {{convert|40,000|shp|lk=in}}, but they produced {{convert|41,318|shp|lk=in}} during her [[sea trial]]s, and gave ''Hermes'' a speed of {{convert|26.178|kn}}. The ship carried {{convert|2000|LT}} of [[fuel oil]] which gave her a range of {{convert|4480|nmi|lk=in}} at {{convert|16|kn}}.<ref>Friedman, pp. 85, 366</ref>

The ship's flight deck was {{convert|570|ft|1}} long and her lifts' dimensions were {{convert|36|by|36.6|ft|m|1}}.<ref>Friedman, p. 84, 366</ref> Her [[hangar]] was {{convert|400|ft|1}} long, {{convert|50|ft|1}} wide and {{convert|16|ft|1}} high. ''Hermes'' was fitted with longitudinal arresting gear.<ref name=m1/> A large [[crane (machine)|crane]] was positioned behind the island. Because of her size, the ship was only able to carry about 20 aircraft. Bulk [[petrol]] storage consisted of {{convert|7,000|impgal|l usgal}}. The ship's crew totalled 33 officers and 533 men, exclusive of the air group, in 1939.<ref>Friedman, p. 366</ref>

For self-defence against enemy warships, ''Hermes'' had six [[BL 5.5 inch Mark I naval gun|BL 5.5-inch Mk I guns]], three on each side of the ship. All four of her [[QF 4 inch Mk V naval gun|QF Mk V 4-inch]] [[Anti-aircraft warfare|anti-aircraft]] guns were positioned on the flight deck. The ship's [[waterline]] [[Belt armor|belt]] armour was {{convert|3|in|mm|0}} thick<ref name=gg1/> and her flight deck, which was also the ship's strength deck,<ref>Brown, p. 120</ref> was {{convert|1|in|mm}} thick.<ref name=gg1/> ''Hermes'' had a [[metacentric height]] of {{convert|2.9|ft|1}} and handled well in heavy weather. However, she had quite a large surface area exposed to the wind and required as much as 25 to 30 degrees of [[weather helm]] at low speed when the wind was blowing from the side.<ref>Friedman, pp. 84<U+2013>85</ref>

==Service==
[[File:HMS Hermes (95) at Honululu c1924.jpg|thumb|HMS ''Hermes'' at [[Pearl Harbor]], circa 1924]]
''Hermes'' was laid down by [[Armstrong-Whitworth|Sir W. G. Armstrong-Whitworth and Company]] at [[Walker-on-Tyne|Walker]] on the [[River Tyne]] on 15 January 1918<ref name=f3/> as the world's first purpose-designed aircraft carrier,<ref>Milanovich, p. 13</ref> and was launched on 11 September 1919. She was christened by Mrs. A. Cooper, daughter of the [[First Lord of the Admiralty]], [[Walter Long, 1st Viscount Long|Walter Long]]. The shipyard was scheduled to close at the end of 1919 and the Admiralty ordered the ship towed to [[HMNB Devonport|Devonport]], where she arrived in January 1920 for completion.<ref name=m1/>

===1920s===
[[Captain (Royal Navy)|Captain]] Arthur Stopford was appointed as the ship's commanding officer in February 1923 and the ship began her sea trials in August. After [[fitting-out]], ''Hermes'' was [[Ship commissioning|commissioned]] on 19 February 1924 and later assigned to the Atlantic Fleet. She conducted flying trials with the [[Fairey IIID]] [[reconnaissance]] [[biplanes]] for the next several months. ''Hermes'' participated in the [[fleet review (Commonwealth realms)|fleet review]] conducted by King [[George V]] on 26 July in [[Spithead]]. Afterwards she was refitted until November and then transferred to the Mediterranean Fleet. She arrived at [[Malta]] on 22 November and needed some repairs to fix storm damage suffered en route.<ref>McCart, pp. 11, 13<U+2013>16</ref> At this time the ship embarked [[No. 403 (Fleet Fighter) Flight RAF / No. 403 (Fleet Fighter) Flight FAA|No. 403 Flight]] with [[Fairey Flycatcher]] [[fighter (aircraft)|fighter]]s and [[No. 441 (Fleet Reconnaissance) Flight RAF / No. 441 (Fleet Reconnaissance) Flight FAA|441 Flight]] with Fairey IIIDs.<ref>Sturtivant, pp. 466, 468</ref> ''Hermes'' conducted flying exercises with ''Eagle'' and the rest of the Mediterranean Fleet in early 1925 before she began a seven-week refit in Malta on 27 March, then sailed for [[Portsmouth]] where she arrived on 29 May after her aircraft had flown ashore.<ref>McCart, pp. 16<U+2013>17</ref>

''Hermes'' sailed for the China Station on 17 June with 403 and 441 Flights aboard, but made a lengthy pause en route in the Mediterranean during which Captain Stopford was replaced by Captain C. P. Talbot. She arrived at [[Hong Kong]] on 10 August 1925. The ship made her first foreign port visit to [[Amoy]] in November. ''Hermes'' returned to the Mediterranean in early 1926 and was refitted at Malta between April and June.<ref>McCart, pp. 18, 20</ref> 441 Flight was transferred to ''Eagle'' at this time in exchange for [[No. 440 (Fleet Reconnaissance) Flight RAF / No. 440 (Fleet Reconnaissance) Flight FAA|440 Flight]] which flew aboard in September. [[No. 442 (Fleet Reconnaissance) Flight RAF / No. 442 (Fleet Reconnaissance) Flight FAA|442 Flight]] also joined the ship at this time; both flights were equipped with Fairey IIIs.<ref>Sturtivant, pp. 467<U+2013>68</ref> The ship exercised with the Mediterranean Fleet after her refit was completed and Captain R. Elliot relieved Captain Talbot on 14 August. ''Hermes'' returned to Hong Kong on 11 October and conducted routine training until she sailed to the naval base at [[Weihai|Wei Hai Wei]] on 27 July 1927 to escape the summer heat. The ship rendezvoused in September with ''Argus'', which was to replace her on the China Station. Before she departed the area, however, both ships attacked the pirate base at [[Bias Bay]] and their fleet of [[junk (ship)|junk]]s and [[sampan]]s. ''Hermes'' reached the United Kingdom on 26 October and began a refit at [[Chatham Dockyard]] at the beginning of November.<ref>McCart, pp. 20<U+2013>22</ref> One of her 4-inch guns was removed at this time. Sometime after this refit, the ship was provided with two single {{convert|1.57|in|adj=on|0}} [[QF 2 pounder naval gun|2-pounder "pom-pom"]] AA guns.<ref name=f9>Friedman, p. 89</ref>

Captain Eliot was relieved by Captain G. Hopwood on 2 December and the ship sailed for the China Station on 21 January 1928.<ref>McCart, p. 22</ref> The Fairey IIIDs of 440 Flight had been replaced by IIIFs, and the ship kept the same three flights for this deployment.<ref>Sturtivant, pp. 466<U+2013>68</ref> En route to Hong Kong, ''Hermes'' stopped at [[Bangkok]], [[Siam]], in March for four days and was inspected by King [[Prajadhipok|Rama VII]]. She reached Hong Kong on 18 March, relieving ''Argus''. The ship spent a month in the port of [[Chefoo]] in May and then the following three weeks in Wei Hai Wei. While visiting [[Chinwangtao]] in July, one of her Fairey IIIF seaplanes made a forced landing outside the port; the {{ship|Italian destroyer|Muggia}} rescued the pilot and towed the aircraft back to the carrier. During the rest of the year, the ship visited [[Shanghai]], [[Manila]], as well as [[Kudat]] and [[Jesselton]] in [[Borneo]]. She began a refit in Hong Kong in January 1929 and Captain J. D. Campbell assumed command on 28 March. After refit was completed in April,'' Hermes'' conducted flying training before sailing up the [[Yangtze River]] to visit [[Nanking]] the following month. Afterwards she spent the next four months at Wei Hei Wei. She made visits to [[Tsingtao]] and [[Japan]] before returning to Hong Kong on 29 October where she remained for the rest of the year.<ref>McCart, pp. 22<U+2013>24</ref>

===1930s===
On 28 January 1930, ''Hermes'' transported the British Minister to China, Sir [[Miles Lampson, 1st Baron Killearn|Miles Lampson]], to Nanking for talks with the [[Nanjing decade|Chinese Government]] over the [[Japanese invasion of Manchuria]] and she remained there until she sailed downriver to Shanghai on 2 March. By the end of the month, the carrier was back in Hong Kong and remained there until June when she returned to Wei Hai Wei for her annual summer visit. The ship briefly returned to Hong Kong before departing for Great Britain on 7 August. ''Hermes'' reached Portsmouth on 23 September, but only remained there for six days before transferring to [[Sheerness]]. Captain E. J. G. MacKinnon relieved Captain Campbell there on 2 October. She was given a brief refit at [[Chatham Dockyard]] before sailing for the China Station. The ship had aboard only 403 and 440 Flights on this deployment and transported six [[Blackburn Ripon]]s to deliver to Malta and HMS ''Eagle''. Hermes departed Portsmouth on 12 November and reached Hong Kong on 2 January 1931. En route to her summer refuge at Wei Hai Wei, the ship received a report on 9 July that the submarine {{HMS|Poseidon|P99|2}} had been sunk there while on exercise. Captain MacKinnon took command of the rescue effort when ''Hermes'' arrived at the accident site an hour afterwards. Eight of the submarine's crewmen managed to escape through the forward torpedo hatch, but only six of those reached the surface where they were picked up and treated in ''Hermes''{{'}}s [[sickbay]]; two of those six subsequently died.<ref>McCart, pp. 24<U+2013>26</ref>

[[File:HMS Hermes 1938.jpg|thumb|''Hermes'' in 1938|left]]
The ship remained at Wei Hai Wei until the end of August when she sailed up the Yangtze River for [[Hankow]]. She reached the inland port on 5 September and dispatched armed guards to put down unrest on several British-owned merchant ships. Her primary purpose, though, was to aid the Chinese government's survey of the massive flooding in the area. [[Charles Lindbergh]] and his wife, [[Anne Morrow Lindbergh]], were also in the city to survey the flooding with their [[Lockheed Sirius]] float-plane and they were invited to use the carrier as their base. Unfortunately, their aircraft was flipped on the morning of 2 October by a strong current as it was being hoisted out by ''Hermes''{{'}}s crane. They were quickly rescued by a boat from the carrier, but their aircraft was damaged. Captain MacKinnon offered to take them and their aircraft to Shanghai where it could be repaired and the ship departed the next day. She remained in Shanghai until 2 November, when she sailed for Hong Kong. ''Hermes'' received a distress message on 3 November from a Japanese merchantman, SS ''Ryinjin Maru'', that had run aground on the Tan Rocks near the Chinese mainland at the mouth of the [[Taiwan Strait]]. The ship managed to rescue nine crew members before she was relieved by the {{ship|Japanese destroyer|Nashi}} and could proceed to Hong Kong. She reached the city on 7 November and remained in the area until April 1932.<ref>McCart, pp. 27<U+2013>28</ref>

Captain MacKinnon took sick the next month and he was relieved by Captain W. B. Mackenzie on 25 February. After a short refit, the carrier, escorted by the destroyer {{HMS|Whitehall|1918|2}}, made a brief visit to Amoy in late April before sailing for Wei Hai Wei where she stayed until 17 September. On that day, ''Hermes'' sailed for the Japanese city of [[Nagasaki]] and then spent four weeks in Shanghai. The ship did not return to Hong Kong until 28 October and spent the next few months there. In January 1933, the carrier visited the [[Philipines]] for several weeks before returning to Hong Kong where she was given a brief refit. After short visits to Tsingtao and Wei Hai Wei, ''Hermes'' departed Hong Kong in mid-June for Great Britain. She reached Sheerness on 22 July, but the ship was transferred shortly afterwards to Chatham Dockyard and opened to the public during Navy Week in early August. She sailed the next month for Devonport Dockyard for a thorough refit.<ref>McCart, pp. 28<U+2013>30</ref> Transverse arresting gear was fitted and her machinery was thoroughly overhauled. Sometime in 1932, the two single 2-pounders were replaced by two quadruple [[Vickers .50 machine gun|.50-calibre Mark III]] [[machine gun]] mounts.<ref name=f9/>

Captain the Honourable G. Fraser was appointed on 15 August 1934 as the new commanding officer and the ship began trials of the new equipment in early November.<ref name=m2>McCart, p. 32</ref> At the same time the nine [[Fairey Seal]] [[torpedo bomber]]s of [[824 Naval Air Squadron|824 Squadron]] joined the ship.<ref>Sturtivant, p. 258</ref> ''Hermes'' left Portsmouth on 18 November for the China Station and arrived at Hong Kong on 4 January 1935.<ref name=m2/> The [[Hawker Osprey]] reconnaissance biplanes of [[803 Naval Air Squadron|803 Squadron]] were transferred aboard from ''Eagle'' before that ship left Hong Kong.<ref>Sturtivant, p. 172</ref> Pirates captured a British-owned merchant ship, SS ''Tungchow'', with 90 British and American children on board on 29 January and ''Hermes'' was ordered to search for the ship when she failed to arrive at Chefoo at her scheduled time. Three Seals spotted her in Bias Bay on 1 February and the pirates abandoned the ship when it was found, leaving the passengers unharmed. ''Hermes'' remained in the vicinity of Hong Kong until mid-May when she steamed to Wei Hai Wei. There she remained until 12 September when the Admiralty decided to transfer her to Singapore where she was closer to East Africa in case a military response to the [[Italian invasion of Ethiopia]] was deemed necessary.{{#tag:ref|Tensions between the UK and Italy were high as a result of the earlier [[Abyssinia Crisis]] and the UK considered intervening against the Italians, but ultimately chose to do nothing.|group=Note}} The ship arrived on 19 September and remained in the area for the next five months.<ref>McCart, pp. 32, 34<U+2013>35</ref>

The ship's aircraft were detailed to search for the missing ''[[Lady Southern Cross]]'' of Sir [[Charles Kingsford Smith]] when it failed to arrive at Singapore on 8 November during an attempt to set a new speed record between Britain and Australia. No sign was found of either the aircraft or its crew despite a month-long search. ''Hermes'' returned to Hong Kong at the beginning of March 1936 before beginning a tour of Japan on 21 April, escorted by the destroyers {{HMS|Duncan|D99|2}} and {{HMS|Delight|H38|2}}. She summered at Wei Hai Wei and did not return to Hong Kong until the end of October. For most of January 1937, the carrier, accompanied by the [[heavy cruiser]] {{HMS|Dorsetshire|40|2}} and the destroyers ''Duncan'' and {{HMS|Diana|H49|2}}, toured the [[Dutch East Indies]]. The ship's torpedo bombers practised torpedo attacks on the cruisers {{HMS|Cumberland|57|2}} and ''Dorsetshire'' in February, working with the Royal Air Force's torpedo bombers based at [[Seletar Airport|RAF Seletar]], Singapore. ''Hermes'' left Singapore on 17 March, leaving 803 Squadron behind, and reached Plymouth on 3 May 1937. Following the [[Fleet Review|Coronation Fleet Review]] at Spithead on 20 May for King [[George VI]], she was assigned to the [[Reserve Fleet]]. On 16 July 1938, ''Hermes'' was transferred from the Reserve Fleet and became a training ship at Devonport.<ref>McCart, pp. 35, 37<U+2013>39</ref>

Plans were made in 1937 to replace ''Hermes''{{'}}s three single 4-inch guns with two twin 4-inch anti-aircraft guns, one forward and another aft of the island, as well as two octuple 2-pounder mounts. A single [[HACS|High-Angle Control System]] would have been fitted to control these guns, but the dockyard was overwhelmed with other work and couldn't begin to design the changes until July 1938. They were scheduled to be installed between September and December 1939, but the beginning of the war intervened and nothing was done. The ship's petrol storage was to be increased to {{convert|13,000|impgal|l USgal}} in April 1940, but this also does not seem to have occurred.<ref>Friedman, pp. 89, 368</ref>

===World War II===
The ship was given a brief refit in early August 1939 and Captain F. E. P. Hutton assumed command on 23 August. She was recommissioned the following day, and 12 Fairey Swordfish torpedo bombers of [[814 Naval Air Squadron|814 Squadron]] flew aboard on 1 September. ''Hermes'' conducted [[Anti-submarine warfare|anti-submarine]] patrols in mid-September in an effort to find and destroy U-boats in the [[Western Approaches]]. On 18 September, the day after the fleet carrier {{HMS|Courageous|50|2}} was sunk on one such patrol, ''Hermes'' located a submarine, but attacks by her escorting destroyers, {{HMS|Isis|D87|2}} and {{HMS|Imogen|D44|2}}, were ineffective. The carrier was then ordered to return to Devonport where she was fitted with [[degaussing]] gear during another brief refit. On 7 October, the ship rendezvoused with the {{ship|French battleship|Strasbourg}} and they arrived at Dakar in [[French West Africa]] on 16 October. Designated as Force X, they began searching for German ships in the Atlantic on 25 October. ''Hermes'' performed these patrols with no sightings until the end of December when she escorted a convoy to Britain where she could be refitted from 9 January to 10 February 1940; the ship then returned to Dakar and resumed her patrols for German commerce raiders and blockade runners.<ref>McCart, pp. 39<U+2013>40</ref>
[[File:HMS Hermes June 1940.jpg|thumb|left|''Hermes'' and {{HMS|Dorsetshire|40|6}} escorting a convoy in June 1940]]

Captain Richard F. J. Onslow relieved Captain Hutton on 25 May and ''Hermes'' continued her fruitless patrols. After returning from one such patrol on 29 June, the ship was ordered to leave harbour only nine hours after her arrival and to begin a blockade of Dakar as the Governor of French [[Senegal]] had declared the colony's allegiance to the [[Vichy French]] regime. On the night of 7/8 July, a boat from ''Hermes'' attempted to drop four [[depth charge]]s underneath the Richelieu's [[stern]] in conjunction with a torpedo attack by the Swordfish of 814 Squadron. The boat was successful in reaching the French ship, but the depth charges failed to detonate. The torpedo attack was more successful as one of the battleship's propellers was damaged. French aircraft attacked the British forces several times in retaliation, but without success. While returning to Freetown after the attack, ''Hermes'' accidentally rammed the armed merchant cruiser [[RMS Corfu|HMS ''Corfu'']] during a rainstorm in the dark on 10 July. The impact injured three of the carrier's crew, one of whom subsequently died of his injuries, but no one from ''Corfu''{{'}}s crew was injured. The two ships were locked together so that ''Corfu''{{'}}s crew could walk from one to the other when Captain Onslow ordered most of her crew to be evacuated onto ''Hermes''. They were pulled apart by a combination of the carrier's turbines at full speed astern and blowing of [[ballast tank]]s on board ''Corfu'' to lighten that ship forward. ''Hermes'' had crumpled the forward {{convert|30|ft|1}} of her bow, mostly above water, and was able to proceed to Freetown at {{convert|12|kn}}, but ''Corfu'' had to be towed stern first to Freetown where she arrived three days later. The carrier joined a convoy to South Africa on 5 August and began repairs at [[Simonstown]] 12 days later. They were completed on 2 November and the ship arrived back at Freetown on 29 November after working up.<ref>McCart, pp. 41, 43<U+2013>44</ref>

The ship was joined by the light cruiser {{HMS|Dragon|D46|2}} on 2 December to search for German commerce raiders in the South Atlantic. They mostly operated from [[Saint Helena]] during the month and were later joined by the armed merchant cruiser {{HMS|Pretoria Castle|F61|2}} to search for the [[pocket battleship]] {{ship|German cruiser|Admiral Scheer||2}} without success. The force sailed for Simonstown on 31 December and ''Hermes'' was dispatched to search off the South African coast for Vichy French blockade runners. One such ship was spotted on 26 January, but she returned to Madagascar. On 4 February, the ship headed north to rendezvous with the heavy cruisers {{HMS|Shropshire|73|2}} and {{HMS|Hawkins|D86|2}} to blockade the Somali port of [[Kismayo]] which was under [[East African Campaign (World War II)#Campaign in Italian Somaliland and southern Ethiopia|siege by Commonwealth forces]]. ''Hawkins'' captured three Italian merchantmen and ''Hermes'' captured one on 12 February.<ref>McCart, pp. 44<U+2013>45</ref>

On 22 February, the carrier was one of the ships tasked to search for ''Admiral Scheer'' after she was spotted by an aircraft from the light cruiser {{HMS|Glasgow|C21|2}}, but the pocket battleship successfully broke contact.<ref>Rohwer, p. 59</ref> ''Hermes'' arrived in [[Colombo]], [[Ceylon]], on 4 March and continued to search for Axis shipping. She was sent to the Persian Gulf in April to support [[Anglo-Iraqi_War#Basra|British operations]] in [[Basra]], Iraq, and remained there until mid-June when she returned to patrolling the Indian Ocean between Ceylon and the [[Seychelles Islands]]. The ship continued to patrol until 19 November when she arrived in Simonstown for a refit that was not completed until 31 January 1942. ''Hermes'' was assigned to the Eastern Fleet and arrived at Colombo on 14 February. She put to sea on 19 February to receive the Swordfish of 814 Squadron and to rendezvous with the destroyer {{HMAS|Vampire|D68|6}} to conduct an anti-submarine patrol. The squadron was disembarked on 25 February after the ships arrived in [[Trincomalee]] Harbour. The two ships were ordered to [[Fremantle]], Australia, in mid-March to join the Allied naval forces headquartered there, but they were recalled after three days and assigned to Force B of the Eastern Fleet.<ref>McCart, pp. 46<U+2013>48</ref>

After the raid on Colombo by the Japanese aircraft carriers on 5 April, ''Hermes'' and ''Vampire'' were sent to Trincomalee to prepare for [[Operation Ironclad]], the British invasion of Madagascar, and 814 Squadron was sent ashore. After advance warning of a Japanese air raid on 9 April 1942, they left Trincomalee and sailed south down the Ceylon coast before it arrived.<ref>McCart, pp. 48<U+2013>49</ref> They were spotted off Batticaloa, however, by a Japanese reconnaissance plane from the battleship {{ship|Japanese battleship|Haruna||2}}.<ref>Shores, et al., p. 422</ref> The British intercepted the spot report and ordered the ships to return to Trincomalee with the utmost dispatch and attempted to provide fighter cover for them.<ref>McCart, p. 49</ref> The Japanese launched 85 [[Aichi D3A]] [[dive bomber]]s, escorted by nine [[Mitsubishi A6M Zero]] fighters, at the two ships. At least 32 attacked them and sank them in quick order despite the arrival of six [[Fairey Fulmar]] II fighters of [[No. 273 Squadron RAF]]. Another six Fulmars from 803 and [[806 Naval Air Squadron|806 Squadrons]] arrived after ''Hermes'' had already sunk. The rest of the Japanese aircraft attacked other ships further north, sinking the [[Royal Fleet Auxiliary|RFA]] ''Athelstone'' of 5,571 [[gross register tonnage]] (GRT), her escort, the [[corvette]] {{HMS|Hollyhock|K64|2}}, the [[oil tanker]] {{SS|British Sergeant}} and the Norwegian ship {{SS|Norviken}} of 2,924 GRT.<ref>Shores, et al., pp. 422<U+2013>28</ref>

''Hermes'' sank with the loss of 307 men, including Captain Onslow. ''Vampire''{{'}}s captain and seven crewmen were also killed. Most of the survivors of the attack were picked up by the hospital ship ''Vita''.<ref>McCart, p. 50</ref> Japanese losses to all causes were four D3As lost and five more damaged, while two Fulmars were shot down.<ref>Shores, et al., p. 428</ref>
