'''''Mahavishnu''''' is an album by the [[Mahavishnu Orchestra]], released in 1984 by [[Wounded Bird Records]]. In 1980's, McLaughlin reformed the Mahavishnu Orchestra for release of the two albums ''Mahavishnu'' and ''[[Adventures in Radioland]]''. This band's overall sound was radically different from the original Mahavishnu Orchestra, in particular because of McLaughlin's extensive use of the [[Synclavier]] synthesiser system.
