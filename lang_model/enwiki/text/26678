[[Image:COA of Gediminai<U+010D>iai dynasty Lithuania.png|thumb|[[Coat of arms]] of the Gediminids dynasty]]

The '''family of Gediminas''' is a group of family members of [[Gediminas]], [[Grand Duke of Lithuania]] (ca. 1275<U+2013>1341), who interacted in the 14th century. The family included the siblings, children, and grandchildren of the Grand Duke and played the pivotal role in the [[history of Lithuania]] for the period as the [[Lithuanian nobility]] had not yet acquired its influence. Gediminas was also the forefather of the [[Gediminids|Gediminid]] dynasty, which ruled the [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]] from 1310s or 1280s to 1572. 

Gediminas' origins are unclear, but recent research suggests that [[Skalmantas (Gediminids)|Skalmantas]], an otherwise unknown historical figure, was Gediminas' grandfather or father and could be considered the dynasty's founder.<ref name=tomas/> Because none of his brothers or sisters had known heirs, Gediminas, who sired at least twelve children, had the advantage in establishing sovereignty over his siblings. Known for his diplomatic skills, Gediminas arranged his children's marriages to suit the goals of his foreign policy: his sons consolidated Lithuanian power within the [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]], while his daughters established or strengthened alliances with the rulers of areas in modern-day [[Russia]], [[Ukraine]] and [[Poland]].<ref name=r91>{{cite book | title=Lithuania Ascending: A Pagan Empire Within East-Central Europe, 1295<U+2013>1345 | first=S.

The relationships among Gediminas' children were generally harmonious, with the notable exception of [[Jaunutis]], who was deposed in 1345 by his brothers [[Algirdas]] and [[K<U+0119>stutis]]. These two brothers went on to provide a celebrated example of peaceful power-sharing. However, Gediminas' many grandchildren and their descendants engaged in power struggles that continued well into the 15th century.<ref name=r69/> Gediminas' grandchildren [[Christianization of Lithuania|converted Lithuania to Christianity]] and inaugurated the first [[Union of Krewo|personal union with Poland]].

== Origins ==
[[Image:Vytenis.jpg|thumb|[[Vytenis]], Grand Duke of Lithuania about 1295<U+2013>1315.]]

Because written sources of the era are scarce, Gediminas' ancestry, early life, and assumption of the title of Grand Duke in ca. 1316 are obscure and continue to be the subject of scholarly debate. Various theories have claimed that Gediminas was either his predecessor Grand Duke [[Vytenis]]' son, his brother, his cousin, or his [[hostler]]. For several centuries only two versions of his origins circulated. Chronicles<U+2014>written long after Gediminas' death by the [[Teutonic Knights]], a long-standing enemy of Lithuania<U+2014>claimed that Gediminas was a hostler to Vytenis;<ref name=tomas/> according to these chronicles, Gediminas killed his master and assumed the throne. Another version introduced in the [[Lithuanian Chronicles]], which also appeared long after Gediminas' death, proclaimed that Gediminas was Vytenis' son.<ref name=tomas/> However, the two men were almost the same age, making this relationship unlikely. In 1868, a letter issued by the Council of [[Riga]] in 1323 was published that contained a small note mentioning Vytenis as "the brother and predecessor" of Gediminas.<ref name=tomas/> After the letter came to light, textbooks almost universally represented Vytenis and Gediminas as brothers. However, historian [[Tomas Baranauskas]] believes the word "brother" has been interpreted too literally, and that the two were in fact cousins.<ref name=tomas>{{lt icon}} {{cite journal| url=http://viduramziu.lietuvos.net/gediminas.htm | title=Gedimino kilm<U+0117> | first=Tomas | last=Baranauskas | journal=[[Voruta (newspaper)|Voruta]] | date=1996-11-23 | volume=44 | issue=278 | accessdate=2007-03-10 | page=6|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071006024617/http://viduramziu.lietuvos.net/gediminas.htm |archivedate = October 6, 2007|deadurl=yes}}</ref>

Grand Duke Vytenis' origins are relatively well-established; he was the son of [[Butvydas]], who was Grand Duke of Lithuania from 1291 to 1295. No consensus exists about the identity of Butvydas' father. While some genealogies give [[Traidenis]] as the ancestor,<ref>{{ru icon}} {{cite book| title=Families of the Nobility of the Russian Empire. Second Volume. Princes | publisher=Vesti |location=St. Petersburg |year=1995 |isbn=5-86153-012-2 |page=26| author=rukovoditel' avtorskogo kollektiva P. Ch. Grebel'skij}}</ref> this has been described as unlikely: the later marriage of Gediminas' daughter Eufemija and Traidenis' great-grandson [[Boleslaw-Yuri II of Galicia|Boleslaw-Yuri]] would have violated [[canon law]], since the two would have been related by blood, and this violation would likely have been noticed by the pope.<ref name=empire/> 

Recent research indicates that Gediminids' ancestor may have been [[Skalmantas (Gediminids)|Skalmantas]]. In 1974 historian [[Jerzy Ochma<U+0144>ski]] noted that ''[[Zadonshchina]]'', a poem from the end of the 14th century, contains a line in which two sons of [[Algirdas]] name their ancestors: "We are two brothers <U+2013> sons of Algirdas, and grandsons of Gediminas, and great-grandsons of Skalmantas."<ref name=tomas/> This discovery led to the belief that Skalmantas was the long-sought ancestor of the Gediminids.<ref name=empire>Rowell, S.

Baranauskas disagrees, believing Skalmantas was Butvydas' brother rather than his father, and that Vytenis and Gediminas were therefore cousins.<ref name=tomas/>

It is known that Gediminas, born about 1275, had one sister (or possibly two, see below for the wife of Andrei of Kozelsk) and several brothers: [[Vainius]], [[Fiodor of Kiev]], possibly [[Vytenis]], and possibly [[Margiris]]. If Vytenis, who was Grand Duke of Lithuania from about 1295 to 1315, was indeed Gediminas' brother, he was probably the eldest son.<ref name=nik>{{lt icon}} {{cite book | title=Gediminas | first=Alvydas | last=Nik<U+017E>entaitis | publisher=Vyriausioji enciklopedij<U+0173> redakcija | location=Vilnius | year=1989 | pages=7<U+2013>16 }}</ref> Historians recognize one son of Grand Duke [[Vytenis]], <U+017D>velgaitis, who may have died before his father.<ref name=empire/> In 1310 <U+017D>velgaitis, already a mature man, led an army to nearby [[Livonia]] in modern-day [[Latvia]] and [[Estonia]].<ref>Nik<U+017E>entaitis, Alvydas. ''Gediminas'', p. 23</ref> After Vytenis died in about 1315, Gediminas became the Grand Duke. There are no sources indicating that Vytenis'  brothers or other family members advanced competing claims.<ref>Rowell, C. S. ''Lithuania Ascending'', p. 60</ref> 

Vainius first appears in written sources in 1324. In 1326, as Duke of [[Polatsk]], he signed a treaty with the [[Livonian Order]] and [[Novgorod]].<ref name=vainius>{{lt icon}} {{cite encyclopedia |editor=Jonas Zinkus, et al. |encyclopedia=Taryb<U+0173> Lietuvos enciklopedija |title=Vainius |year=1988 |publisher=Vyriausioji enciklopedij<U+0173> redakcija |volume=IV |location=Vilnius, Lithuania |pages=419}}</ref> Scholars place his death sometime between 1338<ref name=vainius/> and 1342.<ref name=nik/> Vainius' only known son, Liubko, died in 1342 during a battle with the Livonian Order. 

[[Fiodor of Kiev|Fiodor]], whose relationship to Gediminas was not established until the 20th century, was the longest-lived brother, surviving until at least 1362.<ref name=nik/> In about 1325, with help from Gediminas, he became a Duke of [[Kiev]].<ref name=fiod>{{lt icon}} {{cite encyclopedia |first=Edvardas |last=Gudavi<U+010D>ius | authorlink=Edvardas Gudavi<U+010D>ius | editor= Vytautas Spe<U+010D>i<U+016B>nas |encyclopedia= Lietuvos valdovai (XIII-XVIII a.): enciklopedinis <U+017E>inynas |title=Teodoras |year=2004 |publisher=Mokslo ir enciklopedij<U+0173> leidybos institutas |location=Vilnius |isbn=5-420-01535-8 |pages=31}}</ref> Fiodor was baptized in the [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox rite]] and his pagan name is unknown. Kiev was still under the influence of the [[Golden Horde]], and Fiodor acknowledged fealty to the Horde's [[Khan (title)|Khan]]. This subordination lasted until 1363, when Gediminas' son [[Algirdas]] soundly defeated the Horde in the [[Battle of Blue Waters]].<ref name=fiod/> Scholarly opinion had long considered Fiodor a [[Rurikid]], rather than a Lithuanian, because of his Christian name. In 1916, however, a list of property belonging to [[Theognostus]], a deceased [[List of Metropolitans and Patriarchs of Moscow|Metropolitan of Moscow]], and compiled in the 1330s, was published; among the items listed were two silver cups gifted by "Fiodor, brother of Gediminas".<ref>Rowell, S. C. ''Lithuania Ascending'', p. 100</ref>

[[Margiris]], the defender of [[Pil<U+0117>nai]], is often suggested as the most likely candidate for the fourth brother. The chronicles of [[Hermann de Wartberge]] mention that in 1329 Gediminas and two of his brothers raided Livonia.<ref name=nik/> By that time Vytenis was already dead and Fiodor was probably occupied with establishing himself in Kiev. One of these two brothers must then have been Vainius; the identity of the other still puzzles historians. [[Alvydas Nik<U+017E>entaitis]] suggests that he was Margiris because sources attest to his high status and wealth.<ref name=nik/> Sources mention one son of Margiris, who was captured by the Teutonic Knights soon after his father's suicide in 1336 and did not return.<ref name=nik/> 

The only direct written mention of Gediminas' sister is a legend describing the murder of two [[Franciscan]] [[friar]]s who came to [[Vilnius]] to spread Christianity.<ref name=nik2>Nik<U+017E>entaitis, Alvydas. ''Gediminas'', pp. 55<U+2013>57</ref> This legend was first presented in [[Chronica XXIV Generalium]], a chronicle written before 1369. The events probably took place around 1340, and some eyewitnesses could still have been alive when the chronicle was written. According to the legend Friar Ulrich's preaching angered townspeople. He and his companion, Martin, were seized and brought before Gediminas, who ordered the friars killed. Ulrich was tortured and his body tossed into a river. Martin's body was rescued by Gediminas' sister, an Orthodox nun. She buried Martin at the monastery where she lived.<ref>Rowell, S. C. ''Lithuania Ascending'', pp. 275<U+2013>276</ref> The legend was retold in other sources, including the [[Bychowiec Chronicle]], where the number of [[martyr]]s was increased to fourteen and the initially realistic story acquired a number of miraculous trappings.<ref name=nik2/>

== Wives ==
{{see also|List of Lithuanian consorts}}
It is uncertain how many wives Gediminas had. The [[Bychowiec Chronicle]] mentions three  wives: Vida from [[Courland]]; Olga from [[Smolensk]]; and [[Jewna]] from [[Polotsk]], who was [[Eastern Orthodox]] and died in 1344 or 1345.<ref>{{lt icon}} {{cite encyclopedia | encyclopedia=Lietuvi<U+0173> enciklopedija | title=Jaun<U+0117> |first=Zenonas |last=Ivinskis | location=Boston, Massachusetts | publisher=Lietuvi<U+0173> enciklopedijos leidykla |year=1953<U+2013>1966 |volume=IX |pages=335 |id={{LCC|55020366}} }}</ref> Most modern historians and reference works say Gediminas' wife was Jewna, dismissing Vida and Olga as fictitious, since no sources other than this chronicle mention the other two wives.<ref>{{lt icon}} {{cite encyclopedia | editor= Vytautas Spe<U+010D>i<U+016B>nas |encyclopedia= Lietuvos valdovai (XIII-XVIII a.): enciklopedinis <U+017E>inynas |title=Jaunutis |year=2004 |publisher=Mokslo ir enciklopedij<U+0173> leidybos institutas |location=Vilnius |isbn=5-420-01535-8 |pages=38, 46}}</ref> The historian S. C. Rowell argues that Gediminas' wife was a local pagan duchess, on the grounds that his marriage to a princess from a neighboring land would have been noted in other contemporary sources, and that the reliability of the Bychowiec Chronicle has been questioned.<ref name=r87>Rowell, S. C. ''Lithuania Ascending'', pp. 87<U+2013>88</ref> 

An argument has been advanced that Gediminas had two wives, one pagan and another Orthodox. This case is supported only by the ''[[J<U+00FC>ngere Hochmeisterchronik]]'', a late-15th century chronicle, mentioning [[Narimantas]] as half-brother to [[Algirdas]].<ref name=r87/> Other historians support this claim by arguing this would explain Gediminas' otherwise mysterious designation of a middle son, [[Jaunutis]], as his succession would be understandable if Jaunutis were the first-born son of Gediminas and a second wife.<ref>{{cite book |last=Kiaupa | first=Zigmantas |coauthors= J<U+016B>rat<U+0117> Kiaupien<U+0117>, Albinas Kunevi<U+010D>ius |title= The History of Lithuania Before 1795 |origyear= 1995|edition= English|year= 2000|publisher= Lithuanian Institute of History|location= Vilnius|isbn= 9986-810-13-2|page=118}}</ref>

== Children and grandchildren ==

Because none of Gediminas' siblings had strong heirs, Gediminas and his children were in a favorable position to assume and consolidate power in the Grand Duchy. Gediminas had at least five daughters and seven sons, whose shrewd marriages helped to consolidate and expand the Grand Duchy's influence to areas east and west of Lithuania. Those marriages speak to Gediminas' diplomatic talent in building alliances with the neighboring states that shared his goals to destroy the Teutonic Order and contain the growing power of [[Moscow]] and Poland.<ref name=r87/> The marriages of Gediminas' sons helped to consolidate the dynasty's power over various territories already within the Grand Duchy, while his daughters' and granddaughters' marriages worked to strengthen Lithuanian relationships with neighboring powers.<ref name=r91/>

=== Daughters ===
[[Image:Galicia-Volhynia map.PNG|thumb|300px|Map of [[Galicia<U+2013>Volhynia]]. Two of Gediminas' children, Liubartas and Eufemija, were involved in succession disputes over Galicia<U+2013>Volhynia]]

In 1320 Maria married [[Dmitri of Tver]], ruler of a Russian principality. The marriage took place soon after [[Mikhail Yaroslavich]], Dmitri's father, was killed; his sons were searching for strong allies against [[Yury of Moscow]], their principal competitor for the throne of [[Vladimir]] and All Rus'.<ref name=r91/> After 1327 Lithuania began to supplant [[Tver]] as Moscow's chief rival for supremacy in the Rus'. When Tver sought to rival Moscow, it needed an alliance with Lithuania.<ref name=r114>Rowell, S. C. ''Lithuania Ascending'', p. 114</ref> Dmitri was killed in 1325 and Maria never remarried. Maria's brother-in-law, [[Alexander I, Grand Prince of Tver|Alexander I]], nevertheless maintained friendly relationships with the Grand Duchy of Lithuania and his daughter [[Uliana Alexandrovna of Tver|Uliana]] married [[Algirdas]], the son of Gediminas, who continued the Gediminid line.<ref name=r91/> The cooperation between Lithuania and Tver lasted well into the 15th century.<ref name=r91/>

[[Aldona of Lithuania|Aldona]] (baptized as Ona or Anna; her pagan name is known only from the writings of the 16th century chronicler [[Maciej Stryjkowski]]<ref name=aldona2/>) married [[Casimir III of Poland]], son of [[W<U+0142>adys<U+0142>aw I the Elbow-high|W<U+0142>adys<U+0142>aw I of Poland]], when he was 15 or 16 years old. The marriage took place on either April 30 or October 16, 1325, and was a purely political maneuver to strengthen the Polish<U+2013>Lithuanian coalition against the [[Teutonic Knights]]<ref name=aldona>{{lt icon}} {{cite encyclopedia | last=Jonynas | first=Ignas | editor=Vaclovas Bir<U+017E>i<U+0161>ka | encyclopedia=Lietuvi<U+0161>koji enciklopedija | title=Aldona | year=1933 | publisher=Spaudos Fondas | volume=I | location=Kaunas | pages=208<U+2013>211}}</ref> (an alliance foreshadowing the [[Union of Krewo]] in 1385 and the [[Union of Lublin]] in 1569, with the latter resulting in a stable and powerful new state, the [[Polish<U+2013>Lithuanian Commonwealth]]).<ref name=aldona2>{{lt icon}} {{cite encyclopedia |first=Edvardas |last=Gudavi<U+010D>ius | authorlink=Edvardas Gudavi<U+010D>ius | editor= Vytautas Spe<U+010D>i<U+016B>nas |encyclopedia= Lietuvos valdovai (XIII-XVIII a.): enciklopedinis <U+017E>inynas |title=Aldona |year=2004 |publisher=Mokslo ir enciklopedij<U+0173> leidybos institutas |location=Vilnius |isbn=5-420-01535-8 |pages=40}}</ref> This preliminary coalition was short-lived, collapsing in about 1330, but there is no evidence of military conflict between Poland and Lithuania while Aldona was alive.<ref name=aldona/> 

The marriage into the Lithuanian dynasty that had ruled since about 1289 might have lent legitimacy to the rule of W<U+0142>adys<U+0142>aw I of the [[Piast dynasty]], who was crowned in 1320, replacing the [[P<U+0159>emyslid dynasty]].<ref name=r87/> But Aldona died unexpectedly at the end of May 1339 and was buried in [[Krak<U+00F3>w]]. Aldona had two daughters: Cunigunde (d. 1357) married [[Louis VI the Roman]], the son of [[Louis IV, Holy Roman Emperor]], and Elisabeth (d. 1361) married Duke [[Bogislaw V, Duke of Pomerania|Bogislaw V]] of [[Pomerania]], an area in modern-day Germany and Poland.<ref name=rgt>Rowell, S. C. ''Lithuania Ascending'', p. xxxvi</ref> Elisabeth's daughter, [[Elizabeth of Pomerania]], was the fourth wife of [[Charles IV, Holy Roman Emperor]]. 

Gediminas' daughter Elzbieta married [[Wac<U+0142>aw of P<U+0142>ock]], one of the [[dukes of Masovia]] in modern-day eastern Poland. Her second name is recorded in writings by [[Maciej Stryjkowski]] as ''Danmila'' and [[Teodor Narbutt]] as ''Damila''.

She is mentioned for the last time in 1361, when her brother [[K<U+0119>stutis]] escaped from [[Malbork|Marienburg]] and sought refuge at his sister's house; historians put her date of death at around 1364.<ref name=elz/> In 1337 Elzbieta's daughter Anna, first mentioned in late 1323, married Henry of [[<U+017B>aga<U+0144>]], in modern-day western Poland.

Eufemija (also known as Marija, Ofka, and Anka) married [[Boleslaw-Yuri II of Galicia|Boles<U+0142>aw Jerzy II]] of [[Galicia (Eastern Europe)|Galicia]], in modern-day Ukraine, in 1331. The marriage was engineered in 1323 when the brothers [[Lev II of Galicia|Lev]] and [[Andrew of Galicia]] were slain without leaving heirs. Instead of replacing them with his own son [[Liubartas]] and risking a war with Poland, Gediminas forged a compromise with [[W<U+0142>adys<U+0142>aw I the Elbow-high|W<U+0142>adys<U+0142>aw I of Poland]].<ref name=r224>Rowell, S.

It is possible that Gediminas had two more daughters. According to Maciej Stryjkowski, one of Gediminas' daughters was married to [[David of Hrodna]], his  favorite war leader.<ref name=nik/> However, some historians disagree with the conclusion that David was Gediminas' son-in-law, expressing skepticism about the reliability of Stryjkowski's sources.<ref>Rowell, S. C. ''Lithuania Ascending'', p. 82</ref> The existence of another  daughter, or possibly another sister, has been hypothesized based on the list of [[Metropolitan bishop|Metropolitan]] [[Theognostus]]' property published in 1916. The list contains a note describing Andrei Mstislavich, Duke of [[Kozelsk]] (ruled ca. 1320 <U+2014> 1339), as Gediminas' son-in-law.<ref>Rowell, S. C. ''Lithuania Ascending'', p. 160<U+2013>161</ref> On the other hand, the [[Ruthenian language|Ruthenian]] word ''ziat''' (''<U+0437><U+044F><U+0442><U+044C>'') can mean either "son-in-law" or "sister's husband". Hence Andrei of Kozelsk could have been Gediminas' brother-in-law.

It is unclear why, but [[Jaunutis]], a middle son not mentioned in any written sources before the [[coup d'<U+00E9>tat]] accomplished by his brothers, was designated by Gediminas as his heir in [[Vilnius]] and consequently became the Grand Duke.<ref name=r282>Rowell, S. C. ''Lithuania Ascending'', pp. 282<U+2013>283</ref> His brother [[K<U+0119>stutis]], Duke of Trakai, was assisting him in [[Samogitia]]. Despite help from Narimantas, Jaunutis was deposed by his brothers [[Algirdas]] and K<U+0119>stutis in 1345, just four years after Gediminas' death.<ref name=r282/> Jaunutis tried, but failed, to solicit help from his brother-in-law [[Simeon of Russia]] and was baptized as ''Iwan'' in the process. He was forced to reconcile with Algirdas and in compensation received the [[Duchy of Zas<U+0142>a<U+016D>je]], which he ruled until his death in 1366.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia | editor=Simas Su<U+017E>ied<U+0117>lis | encyclopedia=[[Encyclopedia Lituanica]] | title=Jaunutis | year=1970<U+2013>1978 | publisher=Juozas Kapo<U+010D>ius | volume=II | location=Boston, Massachusetts | id={{LCC|74-114275}} | page=516}}</ref>

Several sons of Gediminas continued his male line, but it was [[Algirdas]] who continued the main Gediminid line. Before deposing his brother Jaunutis in 1345, he ruled [[Kreva]] and, despite remaining pagan, married Maria, a daughter of the last prince of [[Vitebsk]].<ref name=r87/> After 1345 he became the Grand Duke of Lithuania and shared his power with his brother K<U+0119>stutis. Their successful collaboration is celebrated in Lithuanian [[historiography]], and gave rise to a much debated theory that a tradition of co-rule or diarchy in Lithuania was customary and arose as early as 1285.<ref name=nik/> The Grand Duchy experienced its greatest expansion during their reign. While Algirdas was mostly active in the east, K<U+0119>stutis occupied himself by managing the Duchy's interactions with the Teutonic Knights, Poland, and other western European entities.<ref>{{cite book | last=Kiaupa | first=Zigmantas | coauthors=J<U+016B>rat<U+0117> Kiaupien<U+0117>, Albinas Kunevi<U+010D>ius | title=The History of Lithuania Before 1795 | origdate= | origyear=1995 | edition=English | year=2000 | publisher=Lithuanian Institute of History | location=Vilnius | isbn=9986-810-13-2 | pages=119<U+2013>120}}</ref> In 1350 Algirdas contracted a second marriage with [[Uliana Alexandrovna of Tver|Uliana of Tver]]; he chose their son [[Jogaila]] as the next Grand Duke. In 1385 Jogaila opened a new chapter in the [[history of Lithuania]] by [[Christianization of Lithuania|converting the country to Christianity]] and signing a [[Union of Krewo|personal union with Poland]], becoming King of Poland. This [[Polish<U+2013>Lithuanian union]], in various forms, survived until the [[Partitions of Poland|third partition]] of the [[Polish<U+2013>Lithuanian Commonwealth]] in 1795. Jogaila's branch of the Gediminids is known as the [[Jagiellon dynasty]].

[[K<U+0119>stutis]], Duke of Trakai, despite exercising considerable autonomy while controlling the western provinces of the duchy, was loyal to Algirdas and acknowledged his superiority.  K<U+0119>stutis was a devoted pagan and dedicated his life to defending Lithuania from the Teutonic Knights. A popular romantic legend arose about his marriage to the pagan priestess [[Birut<U+0117>]] of [[Palanga]]. They had seven or eight children, including [[Vytautas the Great]].<ref name="rgt"/> After Algirdas' death in 1377, his son Jogaila became the Grand Duke. At first K<U+0119>stutis and his son Vytautas acknowledged Jogaila's rule, but after Jogaila signed the controversial [[Treaty of Dovydi<U+0161>k<U+0117>s]] with the Teutonic Knights, K<U+0119>stutis seized Vilnius and became the Grand Duke in late 1381.

[[Manvydas]] was the eldest son of Gediminas and inherited the territories of [[Kernav<U+0117>]] and [[Slonim]] from his father.<ref name=r280/> Little is known about him, and he died soon after Gediminas. It is believed that he was killed in the [[Battle of Str<U+0117>va]] in 1348 along with his brother [[Narimantas]].<ref name=nik/> 

Narimantas was the second son of Gediminas. He was baptized as Gleb and went on to rule [[Pinsk]], Polotsk, and <U+2013> as his [[Property|patrimony]] by invitation of [[Novgorod]]'s nobles <U+2013> [[Staraya Ladoga|Ladoga]], [[Oreshek]] and [[Korela]].<ref name=narim>{{lt icon}} {{cite encyclopedia |first=Zigmantas |last=Kiaupa | authorlink=Zigmantas Kiaupa | editor= Vytautas Spe<U+010D>i<U+016B>nas |encyclopedia= Lietuvos valdovai (XIII-XVIII a.): enciklopedinis <U+017E>inynas |title=Narimantas |year=2004 |publisher=Mokslo ir enciklopedij<U+0173> leidybos institutas |location=Vilnius |isbn=5-420-01535-8 |pages=42}}</ref> He initiated a tradition of Lithuanian [[mercenary]] service north of Novgorod on the Swedish border that lasted until Novgorod's fall to Moscow in 1477<ref>Rowell, S.

''Lithuania Ascending'', p. 251</ref> In 1345 Narimantas became the strongest supporter of his deposed brother Jaunutis and went to [[Jani Beg]], Khan of the [[Golden Horde]], to ask for support against Algirdas and K<U+0119>stutis. There are rumors that Narimantas married a Tatar princess, but they lack credibility.<ref name=r114/> After a few years the brothers reconciled, and it is believed that Narimantas led the Battle of Str<U+0117>va in the name of Algirdas and died there. He left behind three to five sons who founded Russian princely families, including [[Kurakin]] and [[Galitzine]].<ref name=narim/>

[[Karijotas]] was baptized as Mikhail and inherited [[Navahrudak]] in [[Black Ruthenia]]. In 1348 he was sent by Algirdas to Khan [[Jani Beg]] to negotiate a coalition against the [[Teutonic Knights]], but was handed over to Moscow for ransom.<ref name="r114"/> He died about 1363. It is uncertain how many children he had: the number varies between four and nine.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia | editor=Simas Su<U+017E>ied<U+0117>lis | encyclopedia=[[Encyclopedia Lituanica]] | title=Karijotas | year=1970<U+2013>1978 | publisher=Juozas Kapo<U+010D>ius | volume=III | location=Boston, Massachusetts | id={{LCC|74-114275}} | pages=47<U+2013>48}}</ref> 

[[Liubartas]] (baptized Dymitr) was Gediminas' youngest son. In the early 1320s he married a daughter of [[Andrew of Galicia]] and ruled [[Lutsk]] in eastern Volhynia.<ref name=liub/> After Andrew's and his brother [[Lev II of Galicia|Lev of Galicia]]'s deaths about 1323, Galicia<U+2013>Volhynia experienced a power vacuum. Rather than promoting Liubartas and risking a war with Poland, Gediminas married his daughter Eufemija to [[Boleslaw-Yuri II of Galicia]]. War with Poland was thereby postponed until 1340. The [[Galicia<U+2013>Volhynia Wars]] were settled after 1370, when Poland received [[Galicia (Eastern Europe)|Galicia]], while Lithuania retained [[Volhynia]].<ref name=liub>{{cite encyclopedia | editor=Simas Su<U+017E>ied<U+0117>lis | encyclopedia=[[Encyclopedia Lituanica]] | title=Liubartas | year=1970<U+2013>1978 | publisher=Juozas Kapo<U+010D>ius | volume=III | location=Boston, Massachusetts | id={{LCC|74-114275}} | pages=411<U+2013>412}}</ref> Liubartas died around 1385, having ruled Volhynia for roughly sixty years. He had three sons.
