==History==
Angel station was originally built by the [[City & South London Railway]] (C&SLR), and opened on 17 November 1901{{#tag:ref|Angel is one of five stations on the [[London Underground]] named after a [[public house]] &ndash; in this case the once-famous Angel inn, which dates back to at least 1638. The others are [[Elephant & Castle tube station|Elephant & Castle]], [[Manor House tube station|Manor House]], [[Royal Oak tube station|Royal Oak]] and [[Swiss Cottage tube station|Swiss Cottage]].|group="note"|name="pub"}} as the northern terminus of a new extension from [[Moorgate station|Moorgate]].<ref name=culgnorthern>{{cite web | url=http://www.davros.org/rail/culg/northern.html | work=Clive's Underground Line Guides | title=Northern line | last=Feather | first=Clive |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20150211152300/http://www.davros.org/rail/culg/northern.html |archivedate=11 February 2015}}</ref>{{sfn|Rose|1999}} The station building was designed by Sydney Smith and was located on the corner of [[City Road]] and Torrens Street.{{sfn|Connor|2006|p=124}} On 12 May 1907, the C&SLR opened a further extension from Angel to [[Euston tube station|Euston]]<ref name=culgnorthern /> and Angel became a through station.{{sfn|Rose|1999}}

As with many of the C&SLR's stations, it was originally built with a single central [[island platform]] serving two tracks in a single tunnel &ndash; an arrangement still seen at [[Clapham North tube station|Clapham North]] and [[Clapham Common tube station|Clapham Common]] &ndash; with access from street level was via three Euston Anderson electric [[elevator|lift]]s. When the C&SLR line was closed for tunnel reconstruction in the early 1920s to accommodate larger trains,<ref name=culgnorthern /> the station fa<U+00E7>ade was reclad with a tiling and the lifts were replaced by new ones from [[Otis Elevator Company|Otis]].{{sfn|Connor|2006|p=124}}

===Station rebuilding===
For years since its opening, the station regularly suffered from overcrowding and had a very narrow [[island platform]] (barely {{convert|12|ft|m}} in width), which constituted a major safety issue and resulted in justified fear in passengers.<ref>
{{cite episode |title=[[The Heart of the Angel]] |series=[[Forty Minutes]] |network=[[BBC2]] |date=23 November 1989 |author=[[Molly Dineen]] (producer-director)}}</ref> Consequently, the station was comprehensively rebuilt in the early 1990s.<ref name=angel /> A new section of tunnel was excavated for a new northbound platform and the southbound platform was rebuilt to completely occupy the original 30-foot tunnel, leaving it wider than most deep-level platforms on the system.{{#tag:ref|This rebuilding technique was also applied on Euston's Bank branch platforms.<ref name=angel />|group=note}} The lifts and the ground level building were closed and a new station entrance was opened on 10 August 1992 around the corner in Islington High Street together with the northbound platform while the southbound platform opened on 17 September 1992.<ref name=angel /> Because of the distance of the new entrance from the platforms, and their depth, two flights of [[escalator]]s were required, aligned approximately at a [[Angle#Types of angles|right angle]].{{sfn|Day|Reed|2010|p=197}}

[[File:London angel tube middle escalator upwards.jpg|thumb|upright|The longest escalators on the Underground]]
The station contains a sculpture of an Angel by Kevin Boys in the ticket hall. It is also one of the stations to have only escalator access to the platforms.<ref>[http://www.geofftech.co.uk/tube/facts.html Tube Facts - Tube Stations that only have escalators]</ref>

===Escalators===
With a vertical rise of {{convert|27|m|ft}} and a length of {{convert|60|m|ft}}, Angel station has the longest escalators on the Underground,{{sfn|Day|Reed|2010|p=197}} and the fourth-longest set of escalators in Western Europe (after [[N<U+00E1>m<U+011B>st<U+00ED> M<U+00ED>ru]] in the [[Prague Metro]] at {{convert|87|m|ft}},<ref>[http://archiv.mopo.de/archiv/2001/20010409/200104091216.html Rolltreppen f<U+00FC>r die Welt]{{de icon}}</ref> [[V<U+00E4>stra skogen metro station|V<U+00E4>stra skogen]] in the [[Stockholm Metro]] at {{convert|67|m|ft}}<ref>http://www.idg.se/2.1085/1.258215/en-rulltrappas-sjal</ref> and [[Kamppi metro station|Kamppi]] station in the [[Helsinki Metro]] at {{convert|64|m|ft}}.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.hel.fi/hki/hkl/en/HKL+Metro/Helsinki+metro+stations/Kamppi+metro+station |title=Kamppi metro station |publisher=HKL |date=14 December 2009 |accessdate=21 June 2011 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20121102221412/http://www.hel.fi/hki/hkl/en/HKL+Metro/Helsinki+metro+stations/Kamppi+metro+station |archivedate=2 November 2012}}</ref> )

===Station improvements===
The station was refurbished and work began on 2 January 2007.<ref name=stnrefurbishment>{{cite web |url=http://www.lurs.org.uk/documents/pdf%2007/july/STATION%20REFURBISHMENT%20SUMMARY%20JULY.pdf |title=Station Refurbishment Summary |website= London Underground Railway Society |date=July 2007 |accessdate=31 March 2015 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20141108094151/http://www.lurs.org.uk/documents/pdf%2007/july/STATION%20REFURBISHMENT%20SUMMARY%20JULY.pdf |archivedate=8 November 2014}}</ref> Additional CCTV cameras and Help Points were installed, bringing the total to 77 cameras in the station and 9 Help Points (which were upgraded with new induction loops) to better aid hearing impaired passengers.<ref name=stnrefurbishment /> As well as these, new communications equipment and new signage were installed and damaged signs were replaced.<ref name=stnrefurbishment />

==Former Siding==
When Angel was opened, a long dead-end siding was provided for train stabling, converging from the left onto the northbound line just south of the station.<ref name=angel /><ref>[http://www.davros.org/rail/photos/angel2.gif View of the northbound tunnel and siding]</ref> This was retained over the years but eventually it was closed on 23 January 1959 (along with the signal box at the south end of the platform) to simplify through running.<ref name=angel /> The siding lay derelict and unused until the rebuilding scheme.<ref name=angel /> Part of the siding was used as the northbound diversion tunnel, which branched off the existing northbound line, cut through into the end of the siding and continued along it until it branched off left to the new northbound platform.<ref name=angel />{{#tag:ref|This disused junction of tunnels still survives between the two running lines.<ref name=angel />|group=note}}

==Services and connections==
Train frequencies vary throughout the day, but generally operate every 3-6 minutes between 06:03 and 00:25 in both directions.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.tfl.gov.uk/tube/timetable/northern?FromId=940GZZLUAGL&ToId=940GZZLUKSX&SelectedTime=5 |title=Northern line timetable: From Angel Underground Station to King's Cross St. Pancras Underground Station |website= [[Transport for London]] |accessdate=31 March 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.tfl.gov.uk/tube/timetable/northern?FromId=940GZZLUAGL&ToId=940GZZLUODS&SelectedTime=5 |title=Northern line timetable: From Angel Underground Station to Old Street Underground Station |website= [[Transport for London]] |accessdate=31 March 2015}}</ref>

==Future Proposals==
Angel is a proposed station on the [[Crossrail 2]] (Chelsea-Hackney line) project.<ref name=crossrail2a>{{cite web |url=http://crossrail2.co.uk/the-route/ |title=The Route |publisher=[[Crossrail 2]] |accessdate=20 July 2014 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20150315033711/http://crossrail2.co.uk/the-route/ |archivedate=15 March 2015}}</ref><ref name=crossrail2b>{{cite web |url=http://www.crossrail.co.uk/route/safeguarding/chelsea-hackney-line |title=Chelsea Hackney line |publisher=[[Crossrail]] |accessdate=20 July 2014 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20150319120801/http://www.crossrail.co.uk/route/safeguarding/chelsea-hackney-line |archivedate=19 March 2015}}</ref> Depending on the route constructed, it would be between [[King's Cross St Pancras]] and [[Dalston Junction railway station|Dalston Junction]] or [[Hackney Central railway station|Hackney Central]].<ref name=crossrail2a /> It was officially safeguarded as part of the route in 2007, although there had been proposals for a route for some time previously and safeguarding had been in place since 1991.<ref name=crossrail2b /> This would provide an interchange between a London Underground line and a Crossrail line.
