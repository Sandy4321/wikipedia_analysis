==Mission payload==

STS-130 is scheduled to carry [[ISS node 3|Tranquility]] and the [[Cupola (ISS)|Cupola]] to the International Space Station.

Tranquility was in storage at the [[Thales Alenia Space]] facility in [[Turin]], Italy, and has been flown to Florida in preparation of the flight. It was formerly known as Node 3, and was named by a NASA poll.
