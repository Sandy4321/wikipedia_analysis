She made her debut as child actress in ''[[Barney & Friends]]''. In 2008, she came to prominence as a starring cast member in the television film ''[[Camp Rock]]''. She signed to [[Hollywood Records]] the same year, and released her debut studio album ''[[Don't Forget]]'' in September. It has been certified [[RIAA certification|Gold]] by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA). In 2009, Lovato was commissioned her own television series ''[[Sonny with a Chance]]''. That year, her second album ''[[Here We Go Again (Demi Lovato album)|Here We Go Again]]'' became her first to debut to top the U.S. [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]].

After the release of additional television films and their accompanying soundtracks in 2010, Lovato's personal struggles the following year sent her acting career into hiatus. Her third album ''[[Unbroken (Demi Lovato album)|Unbroken]]'' (2011) addresses several of her difficulties, notably her lead single "[[Skyscraper (song)|Skyscraper]]". Since 2012, Lovato has served as a judge and mentor on the [[The X Factor (U.S. TV series)|American version]] of ''[[The X Factor (TV series)|The X Factor]]''. Her fourth album ''[[Demi (album)|Demi]]'' (2013) was preceded by its lead single "[[Heart Attack (Demi Lovato song)|Heart Attack]]".

Throughout her music career, Lovato has embarked on several concert tours. In 2008, she served as the opening act for the [[Jonas Brothers]]' Burnin' Up Tour and [[Avril Lavigne]]'s [[Best Damn Tour]]. Later that year, she embarked her first headlining tour, the Demi Live! Warm Up Tour, and has held four additional promotional tours in the ensuing years. Her work has additionally earned several accolades, including one [[MTV Video Music Award]] and several [[Teen Choice Awards]] nominations. Outside of her work in the entertainment industry, Lovato is involved in philanthropic activities through charity work and various [[activism|social]] and environmental causes.
