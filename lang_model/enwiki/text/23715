'''Amateur radio''' or [[amateur radio|ham radio]] is practised by more than 16,000 licensed users in [[India]].<ref name="thetribune" /> The first amateur radio operator was licensed in 1921, and by the mid-1930s, there were around 20 amateur radio operators in India. Amateur radio operators have played an important part in the [[Indian independence movement]] with the establishment of pro-independence radio stations in the 1940s, which were illegal. The three decades after India's independence saw only slow growth in the numbers of operators until the then [[Prime Minister of India]], and ham operator [[Rajiv Gandhi]] (VU2RG), waived the import duty on wireless equipment in 1984. Since then, numbers have picked up, and as of 2007, there were more than 16,000 operators in the country. Amateur radio operators have played a vital role during disasters and national emergencies such as earthquakes, tsunamis, cyclones, floods, and bomb blasts, by providing voluntary [[Amateur radio emergency communications|emergency communications]] in the affected areas.

The [[Wireless and Planning and Coordination Wing]] (WPC)<U+2014>a division of the [[Ministry of Communications and Information Technology (India)|Ministry of Communications and Information Technology]]<U+2014>regulates amateur radio in India. The WPC assigns call signs, issues amateur radio licences, conducts exams, allots frequency spectrum, and monitors the radio waves. In India, the [[Amateur Radio Society of India]] (ARSI) represents amateur radio interests at various forums, and represents India at the [[International Amateur Radio Union]]. Popular amateur radio events include daily ham nets, the annual [[Hamfest India]], and regular DX contests.

Public figures in India who are licensed ham operators include the [[Indian National Congress]] president [[Sonia Gandhi]] (VU2SON), Bollywood actor [[Amitabh Bachchan]] (VU2AMY), and a former Minister for Information Technology, [[Dayanidhi Maran]] (VU2DMK).<ref name="iexpress">{{cite news|url=http://www.expressindia.com/news/fullstory.php?newsid=56632|title=Bachchan, Gandhi style!|coauthors=Press Trust of India|date=2005-10-15|work=[[Indian Express]]|publisher=Express Group|accessdate=2008-07-23}}</ref><ref name="hindu-andaman" /><ref name="sonia" />

==History==
The first amateur radio operator in India was Amarendra Chandra Gooptu (callsign 2JK), licensed in 1921.<ref name="amcal1">

Later that year, Mukul Bose (2HQ) became the second ham operator, thereby introducing the first two-way ham radio communication in the country.<ref name="amcal1" /> By 1923, there were twenty British hams operating in India. In 1929, the call sign prefix ''VU'' came into effect in India,<ref name="historical">{{cite web|url=http://142.176.174.139:90/OTC/VE1WG%20Maritime%20Radio%20History%20.pdf|title=Historical Notes on Amateur Radio Development with Official License Records for Maritime Provinces 1911 - 1927|last=Gellis|first=Vm J|date=2007|pages=13|accessdate=2008-07-28}}</ref> replacing three-letter call signs. The first [[short wave|short-wave]] entertainment and public broadcasting station, "VU6AH", was set up in 1935 by [[E P Metcalfe]], vice-chancellor of [[Mysore University]].<ref name="amcal1" /><ref name="brianregal" /> However, there were fewer than fifty licence holders in the mid-1930s, most of them British officers in the [[British Indian army|Indian army]].<ref name="arsi">{{cite web|url=http://www.arsi.info/aboutus.htm|title=About us|publisher=[[Amateur Radio Society of India]]|accessdate=2008-07-23}}</ref>

With the outbreak of [[World War II]] in 1939, the British cancelled the issue of new licences.<ref name="wr">{{cite web|url=http://www.wr6wr.com/newSite/articles/features/mahatmashams.html|title=The Mahatma's Hams|last=Williamson|first=Owen|date=Williamson|publisher=[[WorldRadio]]|accessdate=2008-07-23}}</ref> All amateur radio operators were sent written orders to surrender their transmitting equipment to the police, both for possible use in the war effort and to prevent the clandestine use of the stations by [[Axis power|Axis]] collaborators and spies. With the gaining momentum of the [[Indian independence movement]], ham operator [[Nariman Abarbad Printer]] (VU2FU) set up the [[Azad Hind Radio]] to broadcast Gandhian protest music and uncensored news; he was immediately arrested and his equipment seized. In August 1942, after [[Mahatma Gandhi]] launched the [[Quit India Movement]], the British began clamping down on the activities of Indian independence activists and censoring the media. To circumvent media restrictions, [[Indian National Congress]] activists, led by [[Usha Mehta]], contacted Mumbai-based amateur radio operators, [[Bob Tanna|"Bob" Tanna]] (VU2LK) and Nariman Printer to help broadcast messages to grass-root party workers across the country.<ref name="vu2lk">{{cite news|url=http://epaper.hindustantimes.com/artMailDisp.aspx?article=08_06_2008_009_001&typ=1&pub=264|title=Once a ham always a ham|last=Chandra Kumar|first=C Sujit|date=2008-06-08|work=[[Hindustan Times]]|publisher=[[HT Media Ltd]]|accessdate=2008-07-23}}</ref> The radio service was called the "[[Congress Radio]]", and began broadcasting from 2 September, 1942 on 7.12&nbsp;MHz. The station could be received as far as [[Japanese occupation of Burma|Japanese-occupied Myanmar]]. By November 1942, Tanna was betrayed by an unknown radio officer and was forced to shut down the station.<ref name="wr" />

Temporary amateur radio licences were issued from 1946, after the end of World War II. By 1948, there were 50 amateur radio operators in India, although only a dozen were active.<ref name="amcal1"> Following India's independence in 1947, the first amateur radio organization, the [[Amateur Radio Club of India]] was inaugurated on May 15, 1948 an the [[School of Signals]] at [[Mhow]] in [[Madhya Pradesh]].<ref name="amcal1" /> The club headquarters was later moved to [[New Delhi]], where it was renamed the [[Amateur Radio Society of India]] (ARSI) on 15 May, 1954.<ref name="amcal1" /> As India's oldest amateur radio organization, ARSI became its representative at the [[International Amateur Radio Union]].<ref name="iaru">{{cite web|url=http://www.iaru.org/iaru-soc.html|title=Member Societies|publisher=[[International Amateur Radio Union]]|accessdate=2008-07-23}}</ref>

Partly due to low awareness among the general population and prohibitive equipment costs, the number of licensed amateur radio operators did not increase significantly over the next two decades, numbering fewer than a thousand by 1970.<ref name="amcal2">{{cite book| last = Missra | first = Avinash | title  = Brief History of Amateur Radio in Calcutta | year = 1996 | place = Kolkata | series = Hamfest India '96 Souvenir | url = http://www.qsl.net/vu2msy/homebrew.htm | isbn = }}</ref> [[Continuous Wave|CW]] ([[Morse code]]) and [[Amplitude Modulation|AM]] were the predominant modes at that time. The electronic equipment was mostly [[vacuum tube|valve]]-based, obtained from [[Indian army]] surpluses.<ref name="amcal2" /> During the mid-1960s, the modes of operation saw a change from Amplitude Modulation to [[Single Side Band]] (SSB) as the preferred communication mode. By 1980, the number of amateur radio operators had risen to 1,500. In 1984, then Indian Prime Minister, Rajiv Gandhi, waived the import duty for wireless equipment. After this, the number of operators rose steadily, and by 2000 there were 10,000 licensed ham operators.<ref name="amcal2" /> As of 2007, there are more than 16,000 ham radio operators in India.<ref name="thetribune">{{cite news|url=http://www.tribuneindia.com/2005/20050304/nation.htm#10|title=Government to promote amateur radio|last=Ramchandran|first=Ramesh|date=2005-03-03|work=The Tribune|accessdate=2008-07-27}}</ref>

Amateur radio operators have played a significant part in [[Amateur radio emergency communications|disaster management and emergencies]]. In 1991, during the [[Gulf War]], a lone Indian ham operator in [[Kuwait]], provided the only means of communication between stranded Indian nationals in that country and their relatives in India.<ref name="vu2rvm">{{cite book|last=Verma|first=Rajesh|title=ABC of Amateur Radio and Citizen Band|publisher=EFY Enterprises Pvt.

In December 2004, a group of amateur radio operators on [[DX-pedition]] on the Andaman Islands witnessed the [[2004 Indian Ocean Tsunami]].

In a 2005 notification, the WPC proposed an amendment to the 1978 Amateur Service Rules in the rationalization of the licence categories to only two: the Amateur Wireless Telegraph Station Licence (General) and the Amateur Wireless Telegraph Station Licence (Restricted).

The [[International Telecommunication Union]] (ITU) has divided all countries into [[International Telecommunication Union region|three regions]]; India is located in ITU Region 3. These regions are further divided into two competing zones, the ITU and the [[CQ Amateur Radio|CQ]]. [[Mainland India]] and the [[Lakshadweep Islands]] come under ITU Zone&nbsp;41 and CQ Zone&nbsp;22, and the [[Andaman and Nicobar Islands]] under ITU Zone&nbsp;49 and CQ Zone&nbsp;26. The ITU has assigned to India call-sign blocks 8TA to 8YZ, VUA to VWZ, and ATA to AWZ.<ref name="itu41">{{cite map

The WPC allots individual call-signs. Indian amateur radio operators are allotted only the ''VU'' call-sign prefix. The ''V'' or Viceroy, series prefix was allotted to British colonies.<ref name="viceroy">{{cite news|url=http://www.newindpress.com/Newsitems.asp?ID=IEH20030803131820&Title=Top+Stories&rLink=0|title=Govt yet to free Indian aircraft from colonial past|date=2003-08-04|work=[[Indian Express]]|publisher=[[Express Group]]|accessdate=2008-07-25}}</ref> at the [[1912 London International Radiotelegraphic Convention]].<ref name="callsign1913">{{cite web|url=http://earlyradiohistory.us/1913call.htm|title=Radio Call Letters: May 9, 1913|date=1913-05-09|publisher=Bureau of Navigation, Department of Commerce, United States|accessdate=2008-07-23}}</ref>

VU call-signs are listed according to licence grade: for Advanced Grade and Grade&ndash;I licence holders, the call-sign prefix is VU2; for Grade&ndash;II and Grade&ndash;II Restricted licence holders, the prefix is VU3. As of 2008, call-signs consist of only letters, not numerals, and can be either two or three characters long. Examples of Indian amateur radio call-signs are "VU2XY" and "VU2XYZ".<ref name="hindu-maha">{{cite news|url=http://www.thehindu.com/2006/01/14/stories/2006011403800200.htm|title=Mahamastabhisheka to be covered live on HAM radio|date=2006-01-14|work=[[The Hindu]]|publisher=[[N.

==Awareness drives==
[[Image:Andaman dx-pedition.jpg|thumb|Indian amateur radio operator, Bharathi VU2RBI, demonstrates Amateur Radio to local students in [[Port Blair]], Andaman Islands, a few days before the [[2004 Indian Ocean earthquake]].]]
Indian amateur radio operators number just 16,000 for a population of 1.2 billion, or less than 0.002 percent of the population. Factors for the low numbers include low awareness, high equipment cost, and bureaucratic procedures in obtaining a licence where obtaining a licence can take over a year.<ref name="hamhaina" /> After decades of lobbying to include ham radio in school syllabi, efforts paid off in 2006 after the [[Central Board of Secondary Education]] (CBSE) included ham radio in the chapter of Emergency communications on the subject of Disaster Management.<ref name="cbse">{{cite web|url=http://www.cbse.nic.in/DM%20ENGLISH.pdf|title=Together Towards a Safer India Part-III|date=2006|publisher=Central Board of Secondary Education|pages=69|accessdate=2008-07-25}}</ref> The CBSE is one of the two national education boards. The [[President of India]] [[APJ Abdul Kalam]], in a speech to the [[International Union of Radio Science]] held in [[New Delhi]] in 2005, stressed on the promotion of the hobby and setting up of ham stations in local [[panchayat]] offices, schools and hospitals. They would also act as early warning systems for the village communities in cases of emergencies.<ref name="ursi">{{cite journal|date=2005-10-2005|title=Rapports des Assembl<U+00E9>es G<U+00E9>n<U+00E9>rales de l<U+2019>URSI|journal=URSI|location=New Delhi|volume=XXVII|url=http://www.ursi.org/recordsdelhi.pdf|accessdate=2008-07-29}}</ref>

Amateur radio clubs across the country many join the hobby by organizing courses in preparation for the [[Amateur Station Operator's Certificate]]. The government-funded NIAR is one such organization that actively promotes the hobby by holding regular classes. The [[Vigyan Parishad]], an apex body for science popularization under the [[Department of Science and Technology (India)|Department of Science and Technology]] of the Government of India coordinates simulated disaster communication exercises and also organizes trainings to help people getting ham radio licenses in areas vulnerable to natural calamities.<ref name="dsot">{{cite web|url=http://dst.gov.in/about_us/ar06-07/dst-inst.htm|title=DST Scientific Institutions & Professional Academies|date=2006-2007|publisher=Department of Science and Technology|accessdate=2008-07-25}}</ref>

==Activities and events==

[[Image:200807231359-iia.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Live satellite images such as this are decoded by amateur radio operators to provide accurate weather reports during heavy rains in cities prone to flooding such as Mumbai.]]

Popular events and activities include [[Amateur Radio Direction Finding]], [[DX-pedition]]s, [[hamfest]]s, [[JOTA]], [[QRP operation]]s, Contesting, [[DX communication]]s, and Islands on Air. One of the most popular activities is Amateur Radio Direction Finding commonly known as a "foxhunt".<ref name="cutabove" /> Several clubs across India regularly organize foxhunts in which participants search for a hidden transmitter around the city.<ref name="hindu-fox">{{cite news|url=http://www.hinduonnet.com/2007/10/06/stories/2007100650230200.htm|title=HAM club organising 'Fox Hunt'|date=2007-10-06|work=The Hindu|publisher=N.

[[Hamfest India]] is an annual event that serves for social gathering and comparison and sales of radio equipment. Most hamfests feature a flea market, where the attendees buy and sell equipment, generally from and for their personal stations. The event also seeks to raise amateur radio awareness in the host city. [[Gandhinagar]] is scheduled to host the next hamfest in October 2008. Two special international hamfests were organized in the Andaman and Nicobar Islands (VU4) in 2006, and Lakshadweep (VU7) in January 2007.<ref name="aridx">{{cite web|url=http://www.ari.it/hf/dx-news/425dxn.php?op=wsearch&query=hamfest|title=ARI DX Bulletin|work=ARI - Associazione Radioamatori Italiani|language=IT|accessdate=2008-07-23}}</ref> As amateur radio activity is not permitted on the two union territories due to security restrictions, special permissions were needed to be secured to host the event.<ref name="iitk-andaman">{{cite journal|title=Lifeline Systems in the Andaman and Nicobar Islands (India) after the December 2004 Great Sumatra Earthquake and Indian Ocean Tsunami |publisher=Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur|url=http://www.iitk.ac.in/nicee/RP/2006_Lifeline_EQSpectra.pdf|accessdate=2008-07-25}}</ref> The two events received widespread international participation through contests, [[DXing]], and DX-peditions.

[[Ham net]]s, where amateur radio operators "check into" are regularly conducted across India. Airnet India, Charminar Net, Belgaum Net, and Nite Owl's Net are some of the well-known ham nets in India. Some amateur radio operators have also provided a service of downloading and decoding satellite signals of the weather over India and publishing them on the internet as a public service.<ref name="hamhaina">{{cite news|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/Cities/City_Supplements/Bombay_Times/Hum_hai_na_say_Hams_/articleshow/2167646.cms|title=Hum hai na, say Hams!|last=Rasquinha|first=Gavin Reagan|date=2007-07-03|work=[[Times of India]]|publisher=Times Group|accessdate=2008-07-25}}</ref> In Mumbai, ham operators also help in disaster management during the monsoon season when heavy rain disrupts general life there. In 2008, the [[Municipal Corporation of Greater Mumbai]], for the first time, formally included ham operators as part of the disaster management plan.<ref name="malabar">{{cite news|url=http://epaper.timesofindia.com/Repository/ml.asp?Ref=VE9JTS8yMDA4LzA2LzAzI0FyMDA0MDQ=&Mode=HTML&Locale=english-skin-custom|title=Malabar Hill gets HAM station to combat rains|date=2008-06-03|work=[[Times of India]]|publisher=[[Times Group]]|pages=4|accessdate=2008-07-25}}</ref> Hams in Mumbai also help out at the annual ''[[Anant Chaturdashi|Ganpati Visarjan]]'' by providing emergency radio services to civic organizations at the immersion points.<ref name="visarjan">{{cite web|url= http://www.expressindia.com/latest-news/Lakhs-throng-beaches-on-immersion-day/221158/|title= Lakhs throng beaches on immersion day|accessdate= 2008-07-25|author= Express News Service|date=[[2007-09-26]]|work=ExpressIndia.com |publisher=[[Indian Express]]}}</ref> The "Island on the Air" is another activity where ham enthusiasts visit remote islands and report on the conditions there, similar to DX-peditions.<ref name="cutabove">{{cite news|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/India/Ham_operators_are_a_cut_above_the_rest/articleshow/2063133.cms|title=Ham operators are a cut above the rest|date=2007-05-21|work=[[Times of India]]|publisher=[[Times Group]]|accessdate=2008-07-25}}</ref>
