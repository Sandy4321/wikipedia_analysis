'''''Banksia cuneata''''', commonly known as '''Matchstick Banksia''' or '''Quairading Banksia''', is an [[endangered species]] in the [[Proteaceae]] family. Endemic to [[Southwest Australia|southwest]] [[Western Australia]], it belongs to [[Banksia subg. Isostylis|''Banksia'' subg. ''Isostylis'']], a subgenus of three closely related ''[[Banksia]]'' species with [[inflorescence]]s that are dome-shaped heads rather than characteristic ''Banksia'' flower spikes. A shrub or small tree up to 5&nbsp;m (15&nbsp;ft) high, it has prickly foliage and pink and cream flowers. The common name ''Matchstick Banksia'' arises from the blooms in late bud, the individual buds of which resemble matchsticks. The species is [[pollination|pollinated]] by [[honeyeater]]s (Meliphagidae).

Although ''B.&nbsp;cuneata'' was first collected before 1880, it was not until 1981 that Australian botanist [[Alex George]] formally described and named the species. There are two genetically distinct population groups, but no recognised varieties. This ''Banksia'' is classified as endangered, surviving in fragments of remnant bushland in a region which has been 93% cleared for agriculture. As ''Banksia cuneata'' is killed by fire and regenerates from seed, it is highly sensitive to bushfire frequency<U+2014>fires recurring within four years could wipe out populations of plants not yet mature enough to set seed. ''Banksia cuneata'' is rarely cultivated, and its prickly foliage limits its utility in the cut flower industry.

==Description==
[[File:B cuneata gnangarra 25.JPG|thumb|left|Habit as a 3&nbsp;m (7&nbsp;ft) high shrub|alt=a large spreading shrub in an area of low vegetation less than 1&nbsp;m (3&nbsp;ft) high on a sunny day]]
''Banksia cuneata'' grows as a shrub or small tree up to 5&nbsp;m (15&nbsp;ft) high, without a [[lignotuber]]. It has one or more main trunks with smooth grey bark, and many branches. Young stems are covered in coarse hairs, but these are lost as the stems age. The leaves are wedge-shaped with serrated edges, having from one to five teeth along each side. They range from 1 to 4&nbsp;cm (0.4<U+2013>1.6&nbsp;in) long and 0.5 to 1.5&nbsp;cm (0.2<U+2013>0.6&nbsp;in) wide, on a [[Petiole (botany)|petiole]] of 2 to 3 mm. The upper surface is dull green; as with the stems, both leaf surfaces are covered in coarse hairs when young, but these are soon lost.<ref name="George 1999">{{cite encyclopedia | author = George, Alex S. | year = 1999 | title = ''Banksia'' | editor = Wilson, Annette | encyclopedia = [[Flora of Australia (series)|Flora of Australia]] | volume = 17B | pages = 175<U+2013>251 | publisher = CSIRO Publishing / Australian Biological Resources Study | id = ISBN 0-643-06454-0}}</ref>

Flowers occur in dome-shaped heads from three to four cm (1.2<U+2013>1.6&nbsp;in) in diameter, and comprise 55 to 65 individual flowers. These occur at the end of branches, and are enclosed at the base by a whorl of short [[bract|involucral bract]]s. As with most other [[Proteaceae]], each flower consists of a [[petal|perianth]] comprising four united [[tepal]]s, and a single [[gynoecium|pistil]], the [[style (botany)|style]] of which is initially enclosed within the limb of the perianth, but breaks free at [[anthesis]]. In ''B.&nbsp;cuneata'', the perianth is about 2.5&nbsp;cm (1&nbsp;in) long, with a limb of about 0.4&nbsp;cm (0.16&nbsp;in). Prior to anthesis, the long thin perianth topped by a prominent limb resembles a [[match|matchstick]], which explains one common name for this species. At first, the perianth is mostly cream, being pink only near its base; it later becomes pink throughout. The style is initially cream, but turns red; the [[pollen-presenter|pollen presenter]] is green.<ref name="George 1999"/>

Old flowers soon fall from the flower heads (often called cones at this stage), revealing a woody base which may have up to five [[follicle (fruit)|follicle]]s embedded in it. These are a mottled grey colour, smooth, felted with short fine hairs, and measure from 1 to 1.3&nbsp;cm (0.4<U+2013>0.5&nbsp;in) high, 1.7 to 2.1&nbsp;cm (0.6<U+2013>0.8&nbsp;in) along the seam, and 0.9 to 1.2&nbsp;cm (0.4<U+2013>0.5&nbsp;in) across the seam. Each follicle contains up to two seeds; these are roughly triangular in shape, with a large papery wing.<ref name="George 1999"/>

''Banksia cuneata'' is most easily distinguished from the other two species in ''B.''&nbsp;subg. ''Isostylis'' by its  brighter flowers and duller leaves.<ref name="George 1999"/> It further differs from ''[[Banksia ilicifolia|B.&nbsp;ilicifolia]]'' in its smaller habit; its smooth bark; its smaller leaves, flowers and fruit; and in its sequence of flower colour changes.<ref name="George 1981"/> The leaves, flowers and fruit of ''[[Banksia oligantha|B.&nbsp;oligantha]]'' are smaller still,<ref name="George 1999"/> and its foliage is not as prickly as that of ''B.&nbsp;cuneata''.<ref name="BSG"/>

===Discovery and naming===
[[File:B cuneata gnangarra 23.JPG|thumb|right|The 'matchstick' appearance in late bud gives rise to the common name.|alt=closeup of bloom in late bud; the individual yellow-tipped pink flowers resembling matchsticks]]
The earliest known specimen collection of ''B.&nbsp;cuneata'' was made by [[Julia Wells]] some time before 1880. What would later become the [[holotype|type specimen]] for the species was collected by Western Australian botanist and ''Banksia'' expert [[Alex George]] on 20 November 1971, from [[Badjaling Nature Reserve]], about 8&nbsp;km (5&nbsp;mi) east of Quairading, at {{Coord|31|59|S|117|30|E|display=inline|name=Type locality of Banksia cuneata}}.<ref name="ANHSIR 195208">{{cite web | title = ''Banksia cuneata'' A.S.George | work = Australian National Herbarium Specimen Information Register (ANHSIR) | url = http://www.anbg.gov.au/cgi-bin/anhcoll?event_id=195208 | accessdate = 2009-04-24}}</ref> The species was finally published by George nearly a decade later, in his 1981 monograph "[[The genus Banksia L.f. (Proteaceae)|The genus ''Banksia'' L.f. (Proteaceae)]]". The [[specific name|specific epithet]] is from the [[Latin]] ''cuneatus'' ("wedge-shaped"), in reference to the shape of the leaves.<ref name="George 1981">{{cite journal | author = [[Alex George|George, A.

(Proteaceae)]] | journal = [[Nuytsia (journal)|Nuytsia]] | volume = 3 | issue = 3 | pages = 239<U+2013>473}}</ref>

The species has an uneventful nomenclatural history: it has no [[synonym (taxonomy)|synonyms]], and no subspecies or varieties have been published.<ref name="APNI 53235">{{APNI | name = ''Banksia cuneata'' A.S.George | id = 53235}}</ref> It bears the [[common name]]s of Matchstick Banksia or Quairading Banksia,<ref name="APCND">{{cite web | url = http://www.anbg.gov.au/common.names/ | title = Australian Plant Common Names Database | accessdate = 2010-01-19}}</ref>.

===Infrageneric placement===
George placed ''B.&nbsp;cuneata'' in subgenus [[Banksia subg. Isostylis|''Isostylis'']] because of its dome-shaped flower heads.<ref name="George 1981"/> A 1996 [[cladistics|cladistic]] analysis of the genus by botanists [[Kevin Thiele]] and Pauline Ladiges yielded no information about the circumscription of ''B.''&nbsp;subg. ''Isostylis'', nor of the relationships within it, so George's placement of this species was retained in [[Thiele and Ladiges' taxonomic arrangement of Banksia|their arrangement]].<ref name="Thiele 1996">{{cite journal | author = [[Kevin Thiele|Thiele, Kevin]] and Pauline Y. Ladiges | year = 1996 | title = A cladistic analysis of ''Banksia'' (Proteaceae) | journal = [[Australian Systematic Botany]] | volume = 9 | issue = 5 | pages = 661<U+2013>733 | doi = 10.1071/SB9960661}}</ref> That arrangement was not accepted by George, and was largely discarded by him in [[George's taxonomic arrangement of Banksia|his 1999 arrangement]]. The placement of ''B.&nbsp;cuneata'' there was unaffected, and can be summarised as follows:<ref name="George 1999"/>
:'''''[[Banksia]]'''''
::[[Banksia subg. Banksia|''B.''&nbsp;subg. ''Banksia'']] (3 sections, 11 series, 73 species, 11 subspecies, 14 varieties)
::'''[[Banksia subg. Isostylis|''B.''&nbsp;subg. ''Isostylis'']]'''
:::''[[Banksia ilicifolia|B.&nbsp;ilicifolia]]''
:::''[[Banksia oligantha|B.&nbsp;oligantha]]''
:::'''''B.&nbsp;cuneata'''''

Since 1998, American botanist [[Austin Mast]] and co-authors have been publishing results of ongoing cladistic analyses of [[DNA sequence]] data for the subtribe [[Grevilleoideae|Banksiinae]], which then comprised genera ''Banksia'' and ''[[Banksia ser. Dryandra|Dryandra]]''. Their analyses suggest a [[phylogenetics|phylogeny]] that differs greatly from George's taxonomic arrangement. ''Banksia cuneata'' resolves as the next closest relative, or 'sister', to a [[clade]] containing ''B.&nbsp;ilicifolia'' and ''B.&nbsp;oligantha'', suggesting a [[monophyly|monophyletic]] ''B.'' subg. ''Isostylis''; but the clade appears fairly [[derived]] (that it, it evolved relatively recently), suggesting that ''B.''&nbsp;subg. ''Isostylis'' may not merit subgeneric rank.<ref name="Mast 1998">{{cite journal | author = Mast, Austin R. | year = 1998 | title = Molecular systematics of subtribe Banksiinae (''Banksia'' and ''Dryandra''; Proteaceae) based on cpDNA and nrDNA sequence data: implications for taxonomy and biogeography | journal = Australian Systematic Botany | volume = 11 | pages = 321<U+2013>342 | doi = 10.1071/SB97026}}</ref><ref name="Mast 2002">{{cite journal | author = Mast, Austin R. and Thomas J.

Early in 2007, Mast and Thiele rearranged the genus ''Banksia'' by merging ''Dryandra'' into it, and published [[Banksia subg. Spathulatae|''B.''&nbsp;subg. ''Spathulatae'']] for the taxa having spoon-shaped [[cotyledon]]s; thus ''B.''&nbsp;subg. ''Banksia'' was redefined as encompassing taxa lacking spoon-shaped cotyledons. They foreshadowed publishing a full arrangement once DNA sampling of ''Dryandra'' was complete; in the meantime, if Mast and Thiele's nomenclatural changes are taken as an interim arrangement, then ''B.&nbsp;cuneata'' is placed in ''B.''&nbsp;subg. ''Banksia''.<ref name="Mast 2007">{{cite journal | author = Mast, Austin R. and Kevin Thiele | year = 2007 | title = The transfer of ''Dryandra'' R.Br. to ''Banksia'' L.f.

===Phylogeny===
Relationships between ''B.&nbsp;cuneata'' and the other members of ''B.''&nbsp;subg. ''Isostylis'' still remain unclear. Though Mast's studies found ''B.&nbsp;cuneata'' to be the most [[basal (phylogenetics)|basal]] of the three species,<ref name="Mast 2002"/> a 2004 study of [[genetic divergence]] within the subgenus yielded both other possibilities: some analyses suggested ''B.&nbsp;ilicifolia'' as basal, while others suggested ''B.&nbsp;oligantha''. Further complicating the situation is the existence of a population of ''B.&nbsp;cuneata'' having both genetic and [[phenetics|phenetic]] affinities with ''B.&nbsp;oligantha''. The origin of this population is unknown. It might have arisen through [[Hybrid (biology)|hybrid]]isation, or it may be a transitional or even ancestral form. Finally, [[biogeography|biogeographical]] factors suggest that ''B.&nbsp;ilicifolia'' would be the most basal of the three species: it occurs in the [[High Rainfall Zone]] where [[relict]]ual species are most common, whereas the others are restricted to the [[Transitional Rainfall Zone]], where more recently evolved species are most common.<ref name="Broadhurst 2004">{{Cite journal | author = Broadhurst, Linda M.; Coates, David J. | year = 2004 | title = Genetic divergence among and diversity within two rare ''Banksia'' species and their common close relative in the subgenus ''Isostylis'' R.Br.

==Distribution and habitat==
[[File:Banksia cuneata map.png|thumb|Distribution of ''B.&nbsp;cuneata'' in Western Australia|alt=A map of the biogeographic regions of Western Australia, showing the range of Banksia cuneata. The map shows a continuous distribution in the southern half of the Avon Wheatbelt, shaped somewhat like an upright boomerang.]]
An endangered species, ''B.&nbsp;cuneata'' occurs only over a 90&nbsp;km (55&nbsp;mi) range around [[Pingelly, Western Australia|Pingelly]] and [[Quairading, Western Australia|Quairading]], in [[Western Australia]]. It favours deep yellow sand at elevations between 230 and 300&nbsp;m (700<U+2013>1000&nbsp;ft), in [[woodland]] habitat.<ref name="Taylor 1988">{{cite book | author=Taylor, Anne; [[Stephen Hopper|Hopper, Stephen]] | year=1988 | title = [[The Banksia Atlas]] (Australian Flora and Fauna Series Number 8)

Reports on the number of populations and individuals vary widely. A survey in 1982 reported 450 plants in five populations, with the largest population comprising 300 plants.<ref name="SPRAT 9827"/> In 1988, however, only four populations comprising 300 plants were found; surprisingly, only fifty plants could be found in the location where a population of 300 had previously been reported; yet there were no dead plants, and no evidence of disturbance.<ref name="Connell 1988">{{cite journal | author = Connell, Stephen; Lamont, Byron; Bergl, Stephen | year = 1988 | title = Rare & Endangered: Matchstick Banksia | journal = Australian Natural History | volume = 22 | issue = 8 | pages = 354<U+2013>355}}</ref> Since then the number of populations reported have ranged from 6<ref name="Coates 1992"/><ref name="Burgman 2001"/> to 11,<ref name="SPRAT 9827"/> and reports of the total number of plants have ranged from 340<ref name="Lamont 1991"/> to 580.<ref name="Nichol 1997b"/>

==Life cycle and ecology==
[[File:B cuneata gnangarra 28.JPG|thumb|left|The inflorescences are located at the end of branches. This is often the case with bird-attracting plants, as birds forage by vision.<ref name="ford79"/>|alt=closeup of part of plant, displaying nine blooms on the ends of branches]]
Pollinated in the main by honeyeaters, <ref name="Sampson 1996"/> the inflorescences appear from September to December.<ref name="Collins 2008">{{cite book | last = Collins, Kevin; ''et al.'' | title = Banksias | publisher = Bloomings Books | location = Melbourne, Victoria | date = 2008 | pages = 53, 304<U+2013>05 | isbn = 1876473686}}</ref> Prominent flowers, a red or pink colour, a straight style and a tubular perianth are features thought to promote pollination by birds.<ref name="ford79">{{cite journal|last=Ford HA, Paton DC, Forde N|date=1979|title=Birds as pollinators of Australian plants|journal=New Zealand Journal of Botany|volume=17|pages=509<U+2013>19}}</ref>

The structure of ''B.&nbsp;cuneata''<nowiki></nowiki>'s flower, with the style end functioning as a [[pollen-presenter|pollen presenter]], suggests that [[reproduction|autogamous]] [[reproduction|self-fertilisation]] must be common. This is countered, however, by [[Dichogamy|protandry]]: [[pollen]] is released well before the [[gynoecium|pistil]] becomes receptive; usually by the time the pistil becomes receptive most of the pollen has either been transferred, or has lost its viability. This strategy is effective against individual flowers fertilising themselves, but does nothing to prevent [[geitonogamy]]: fertilisation of flowers by different flowers on the same plant. Because of the way flowers are clustered together in heads, this must be quite common, although whether it results in successful fruit set is another matter.<ref name="Coates 1992"/>

Assessments of the [[mating system]] of this species have found that [[outcrossing]] rates vary between populations. Populations in relatively intact bushland have high outcrossing rates, but those in more disturbed environments are often substantially [[inbreeding|inbred]]. This is attributed to two causes. Firstly, the higher density of disturbed populations leads to greater rates of mating between neighbouring plants, resulting in more [[genetic structure]] and thus more [[Effective selfing model|effective selfing]]. Secondly, disturbed populations usually lack an [[understory|understorey]], and so cannot support a resident population of honeyeaters; instead, they rely upon occasional visitors for pollination. The greatly reduced pollination rates means fewer outcrossing fertilisations, and this means less [[natural selection|selection]] against inbred fertilisations.<ref name="Coates 1992"/>

No seed is set when pollinators are [[pollinator exclusion experiment|excluded]], indicating that seed set must be pollinator-limited. About 96% of fertilized follicles mature, and about 82% of seeds mature. These are very high numbers for ''Banksia'', indicating that there are no problems with nutrient supply. This species produces an unusually high number of old flowerheads, or cones, per plant<U+2014>typically more than 500. However there are an unusually low number of follicles per cone<U+2014>often only one. Thus the number of follicles per plant ends up roughly average for a ''Banksia'' species.<ref name="Lamont 1991"/>

''Banksia cuneata'' lacks a [[lignotuber]], so plants are killed by bushfire. However, this species is strongly [[serotiny|serotinous]]: seed is released only following a fire. Thus plants accumulate an [[canopy seed bank|aerial seed bank]] in fire intervals, which is released all at once after a fire, ensuring population regeneration. The mechanism is a [[resin]] that seals the follicles shut, preventing [[dehiscence (botany)|dehiscence]]; the heat of a bushfire melts the resin, and the follicles open. Intense fires cause the immediate release of the seed and [[seed separator]], but after cooler fires the seed separator often remains in place, blocking the follicle exit and preventing seed release. The wings on the seed separator are [[hygroscopy|hygroscopic]]; they draw together when moistened, then reflex out again as they dry. Thus they lever themselves, and the seeds, out of the follicle over the course of one or more wet-dry cycles, ensuring that seed is released only after rain has fallen.<ref name="Lamont 1991"/> The juvenile period for ''B.&nbsp;cuneata'' is around four years. Populations are very vulnerable to fire during this period, as fire will wipe out the entire population and there will be no seed from which it might recover.<ref name="Lamont 1991"/> 
[[File:B cuneata gnangarra 21.JPG|thumb|right|Woody follicles|alt=three oval grey woody pods covered in short fine hairs nestled among prickly foliage]]
''B.&nbsp;cuneata'' is very unusual in apparently suffering no seed loss due to [[seed predation|granivory]]. In nearly all other species, burrowing [[insect]] [[larva|larvae]] eat a large proportion of seeds, and birds cause further losses in breaking open cones in search of larvae to eat. The seed-eating insects are mostly species-specific, and it appears that no insect species has adapted to ''B.&nbsp;cuneata''. Possible reasons for this are the very low seed counts, and the rarity of the species, both of which offer little incentive for adaptation to the species. There is also no evidence of granivores feeding on seed after it has fallen.<ref name="Lamont 1991"/> As a result, this species has the highest rate of seed viability recorded for a ''Banksia'' species: in one study, 74% of all seed produced in the previous 12 years was viable. This was largely accounted for by seed under 9 years old, about 90% of which is viable. After the ninth year, viability is lost rapidly as the follicles decay and [[senescence]] sets in.<ref name="Lamont 1991"/> Seed production itself starts very slowly. On average, plants aged between 5 and 12 years have about 18 seeds stored in their canopy. Storage increases exponentially, however, and 25-year old plants often have tens of thousands of seeds. Seed production probably never plateaus. In fact, by the time a plant is twenty years old it has accumulated such a great weight of cones that major branches begin to break away; and by the age of thirty, plants have broken branches more often than not. As plants age, branch breakage increasingly leads to plant death, and it is unlikely that any plants live to more than 45 years.<ref name="Lamont 1991">{{cite journal | author = Lamont, Byron B.; ''et al.'' | year = 1991 | title = Seed bank and population dynamics of ''Banksia cuneata'': The role of time, fire and moisture | journal = Botanical Gazette | volume = 152 |issue = 1 | pages = 114<U+2013>22 | url = http://www.jstor.org/stable/2995498 | doi = 10.1086/337870}}</ref><ref name="Burgman 1992">{{cite journal | author = Burgman, Mark; Lamont, Byron | year = 1992 | title = A stochastic model for the viability of ''Banksia cuneata'' populations: environmental, demographic and genetic effects | journal = Journal of Applied Ecology | volume = 29 | issue = 3 | pages = 719<U+2013>27 | doi = 10.2307/2404481}}</ref>

The high seed maturation and viability rates are offset, however, by an extremely low seedling survival rate. This is almost solely due to moisture stress. In one study, an estimated 17,100 viable seeds were released following an experimental fire. Fewer than 5% of them germinated, and only eleven plants survived the first summer drought. The last plants to die were in depressions, in shaded areas or amongst leaf litter; and the eleven survivors were all on road shoulders, where they benefited from road [[Surface runoff|runoff]] and a 3&nbsp;cm (1.2&nbsp;in) thick [[mulch]] of [[pisolite|pisolitic]] [[laterite]]. The inevitable conclusion is that seedling survival is primarily determined by water availability.<ref name="Lamont 1991"/>

==Conservation==
''Banksia cuneata'' was declared [[endangered species|critically endangered]] after a 1982 survey found only five populations comprising about 450 plants. The largest population, consisting of around 300 plants, was on a conservation reserve, but all others were on road verges, and contained only 50<U+2013>70 plants each.<ref name="SPRAT 9827"/> However, since then more plants have been located, and populations have been found to be gradually increasing in response to a number of [[conservation biology|conservation]] measures including fencing and baiting of [[rabbit]]s. In recognition of its slight recovery, it is now considered endangered but no longer critically so.<ref name="SPRAT 9827"/><!-- citation covers the fact that its classification is endangered not criticially endangered, but does not describe change as such -->

In April 1987, Western Australia's [[Department of Environment and Conservation (Western Australia)|Department of Environment and Conservation]] burnt part of one population in an experimental regeneration fire. The mature plants were killed, and the seedlings that [[volunteer (botany)|volunteer]]ed did not survive the summer [[drought]].<ref name="Lamont 1991"/> A ''Matchstick Banksia Recovery Team'' was established in 1995, and over time they succeeded in establishing a large number of seedlings.<ref name="Nichol 1997b">{{cite news | author = Nichol, Jackie | title = Successful re-establishment of matchstick banksia | newspaper = CALMnews | date = November<U+2013>December 1997 | page = 11}}</ref> A large adult population was destroyed by bushfire in 1996, causing further concern, but this was followed by the recruitment of large numbers of seedlings.<ref name="Nichol 1997a">{{cite news | author = Nichol, Jackie | title = Rare plants' regrowth out of Quairading wildfire | newspaper = CALMnews | date = November<U+2013>December 1997 | page = 7}}</ref>

Threats to ''B.&nbsp;cuneata'' include land clearing, which leads to direct plant loss and population fragmentation, [[grazing]] pressure, competition from exotic weeds, changes to the [[fire regime]], and encroaching [[salinity in Australia|salinity]].<ref name="Beecham 2001a">{{cite web | author = Beecham, Brett | title = Avon Wheatbelt 1 (AW1 <U+2013> Ancient Drainage subregion) | work = A Biodiversity Audit of Western Australia's 54 Biogeographical Subregions in 2002 | publisher = [[Department of Environment and Conservation (Western Australia)|Department of Conservation and Land Management]], Western Australian Government | url = http://www.dec.wa.gov.au/pdf/science/bio_audit/avon_wheatbelt01_p7-35.pdf | accessdate = 2009-04-27}}</ref><ref name="Beecham 2001b">{{cite web | author = Beecham, Brett | title = Avon Wheatbelt 2 (AW2 <U+2013> Re-juvenated Drainage subregion) | work = A Biodiversity Audit of Western Australia's 54 Biogeographical Subregions in 2002 | publisher = [[Department of Environment and Conservation (Western Australia)|Department of Conservation and Land Management]], Western Australian Government | url = http://www.dec.wa.gov.au/pdf/science/bio_audit/avon_wheatbelt02_p36-68.pdf | accessdate = 2009-04-27}}</ref> [[The Banksia Atlas]] survey found one population to be on the side of a road; the plants were aging with no new seedlings noted, and the site was weed-infested.<ref name="Taylor 1988"/> A large part of the surviving populations are on private land, and depend on good relationships with local landowners. Many have obliged by fencing off areas and restricting entry of rabbits. There has been some attempt by CALM to translocate populations away from hazardous areas; these have met with some success, helped with watering in the first year.<ref name="BSG"/> 

===Land clearing===
Even before the extensive clearing of the [[Wheatbelt (Western Australia)|Wheatbelt]] in the 1930s, ''B.&nbsp;cuneata'' must have had a highly fragmented distribution, since the deep yellow sand favoured by the species occurs only in patches, and makes up only 10 to 15% of the area. Around 93% of the land has now been cleared of native vegetation, with the remaining 7% occurring in remnants of various sizes. Thus land clearing must have further fragmented an already fragmented population, as well as greatly reduced the number of individual plants.<ref name="Coates 1992">{{cite journal | author = Coates, D.

===Protection of genetic diversity===
[[File:B cuneata gnangarra 22.JPG|thumb|Flowers, such as this one in early bud, develop at the ends of branches.|alt=closeup of a central greenish set of buds in a dome shape surrounded by prickly leaves]]
Levels of [[genetic diversity]] within individual populations of ''B.&nbsp;cuneata'' are unusually high for a rare and endangered species,<ref name="Maguire 1997">{{cite journal | author = Maguire, Tina L. and Sedgley, Margaret | year = 1997 | title = Genetic diversity in ''Banksia'' and ''Dryandra'' (Proteaceae) with emphasis on ''Banksia cuneata'', a rare and endangered species | journal = Heredity | volume = 79 | issue = 4 | pages = 394<U+2013>401 | url = http://www.nature.com/hdy/journal/v79/n4/abs/6882460a.html | doi = 10.1038/hdy.1997.173}}</ref> but the populations fall into two genetically distinct groups. These are separated not by geographical distance but by the [[Salt River (Western Australia)|Salt River]], an [[ephemeral]] saline river system that provides a habitat unsuitable for both ''B.&nbsp;cuneata'' and the birds that pollinate it. It thus functions as a barrier to the exchange of genetic material, allowing populations on different sides of the river to [[genetic divergence|diverge]] through [[genetic drift]]. The implication for conservation is that effort should be invested on both sides of the river in order to conserve as much genetic diversity as possible. It was suggested that one large population from each population group would probably be adequate.<ref name="Coates 1992"/><ref name="Sampson 1996"/><ref name="Hopper 1990">{{cite book | author = [[Stephen Hopper|Hopper, S.

===Disease===
''[[Phytophthora cinnamomi]]'' dieback has not been identified as a threat to this species, but testing has found it to be highly susceptible;<ref name="DEH 2006">{{cite web | url = http://www.environment.gov.au/biodiversity/invasive/publications/pubs/appendix4.pdf |format=PDF| title = Part 2, Appendix 4: The responses of native Australian plant species to Phytophthora cinnamomi | work = [http://www.environment.gov.au/biodiversity/invasive/publications/p-cinnamomi.html Management of Phytophthora cinnamomi for Biodiversity Conservation in Australia] | publisher = [[Department of the Environment, Water, Heritage and the Arts|Department of the Environment and Heritage]], Australian Government | year = 2006 | accessdate = 2009-04-22}}</ref> in one study it exhibited the highest susceptibility of 49 ''Banksia'' species studied, with 80% of plants dead within 96&nbsp;days of inoculation with the disease, and 100% dead within a year.<ref name="McCredie 1985">{{cite journal | author = McCredie, Thomas A.; ''et al.'' | year = 1985 | title = Variability in the resistance of ''Banksia'' L.f. species to ''Phytophthora cinnamomi'' Rands | journal = Australian Journal of Botany | volume = 33 | issue = 6 | pages = 629<U+2013>37 | doi = 10.1071/BT9850629}}</ref>

===Climate change===
The survival of this species is tied closely to rainfall because of the susceptibility of seedlings to drought. It is thus especially vulnerable to the effects of [[climate change]]. This was recognised as early as 1992, when it was noted that winter rainfall in the Quairading region had been falling by about 4% per decade, and that a continuation of this trend may reduce the species' distribution.<ref name="Burgman 1992"/> Recently, a more thorough assessment of the potential impact of climate change on this species found that severe change is likely to lead to [[extinction]], and mild change to a reduction of its range by 80% by 2080. However, there may not be any range reduction at all under mid-severity climate change, depending on how effectively this species can migrate into newly habitable areas.<ref name="Fitzpatrick 2008">{{cite journal | author = Fitzpatrick, Matthew C.; ''et al.'' | year = 2008 | title = Climate change, plant migration, and range collapse in a global biodiversity hotspot: the ''Banksia'' (Proteaceae) of Western Australia | journal = Global Change Biology | volume = 14 | pages = 1<U+2013>16 | doi = 10.1111/j.1365-2486.2008.01559.x}}</ref>

==Uses==
===Cultivation===
Propagation is by seed, although these are hard to obtain.<ref name="Collins 2008"/> Seeds do not require any treatment before sowing, and take around 23 days to [[germination|germinate]].<ref name="Sweedman 2006">{{cite book | author = Sweedman, Luke; ''et al.'' | year = 2006 | title = Australian seeds: a guide to their collection, identification and biology | publisher = CSIRO Publishing | isbn = 0643092986 | page = 203}}</ref> [[Cutting]]s yield unpredictable results.<ref name="Collins 2008"/> The plant itself prefers a deep, sandy, well-drained soil with a [[pH]] of 6.0<U+2013>7.0. It requires full sun, but some protection from the wind is recommended, as this is a fast-growing plant with spindly branches that are easily damaged by wind. A more compact form can be obtained by pruning the top quarter each year.<ref name="Collins 2008"/><ref name="George 1987">{{cite book | author = George, Alex S. | year = 1996 | title = The Banksia Book | edition = 3rd | location = Kenthurst, New South Wales|page=116| publisher = Kangaroo Press (in association with the Society for Growing Australian Plants) | isbn = 0-86417-818-2}}</ref> This species has little appeal to the [[floriculture|cut flower industry]], because of its prickly foliage,<ref name="Collins 2008"/> and its tendency to drip nectar.

Ironically, given its conservation status, Kingsley Dixon of [[Kings Park, Western Australia|Kings Park and Botanic Garden]] suggested that it may have weed potential: the species was trialled as a cut flower crop on land north of Moore River, and seedlings were noted afterwards.<ref name="BSG"/>
