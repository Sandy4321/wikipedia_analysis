The '''''Ersatz Monarch''-class''' (''Replacement Monarch''-class)<ref name=Andrew/> [[battleship]] was a projected new class of four battleships which were to be constructed for the [[Austro-Hungarian Navy]] in 1914<U+2013>1919. Designed to replace the ''Monarch'' class of [[coastal defense ship]]s, each of the battleships were to carry ten {{convert|13.8|in|mm|adj=on}} guns as their primary armament, a slight improvement over her predecessors, the {{sclass|Tegetthoff|battleship|4}}. The ships were {{convert|574|ft|m}} and were designed to displace {{convert|24100|LT|t ST|}}.

The Austro-Hungarian Navy intended to lay down the first vessel in July 1914, but the outbreak of [[World War I]] that month caused the Navy to postpone construction until September. Ultimately, none of the vessels were laid down and they were formally canceled in late 1917. However, four of the 13.8-inch guns had been built and were transferred to the [[Austro-Hungarian Army]] for use on the [[Italian Campaign (World War I)|Italian Front]].

==History==
The [[Austro-Hungarian Navy]] ordered the construction of four new battleships to replace the aging [[Monarch class battleship|''Monarch''-class]] in May 1914.<ref name=Fitzp1933>Fitzsimons (Volume 18), p. 1933</ref> As a result, the new class was known by the contract name for the first vessel, ''Ersatz-Monarch''. The ships were to cost 82<U+2013>83 million [[Austro-Hungarian krone|kronen]] each.<ref name=Andrew/><ref name=Vegop174/> The class was to be built in two separate shipyards: two battleships were to be built by [[Stabilimento Tecnico Triestino]] and two by [[3. Maj|Ganz & Co&nbsp;<U+2013> Danubius]].<ref name=Andrew>Fitzsimons (Volume 8), p. 854</ref>

===Proposals===
[[File:Austrian fleet on maneuvers.jpg|thumb|300px|left|Austro-Hungarian fleet maneuvers|link=File:Austrian fleet on maneuvers.jpg]]
The construction of the [[Tegetthoff class battleship|''Tegetthoff''-class battleships]] had already begun in 1910 when [[Skodawerke A.G]] made the first of many attempts to obtain the approval for a new generation of "super" dreadnoughts to replace the aging ''Monarch''-class ships. The original proposal laid forth on 18 April 1911 consisted of {{convert|13.5|in|cm|adj=on}} 45-caliber guns with three guns in each of the two superimposed turrets.<ref name=Andrew/>

The Austro-Hungarian Naval Technical Committee later submitted three proposals by Austrian chief naval architect [[Franz Pitzinger]] on the general characteristics of the new class in December 1911.<ref name=Andrew/> The first of the three proposals called for a {{convert|22000|LT|t ST|adj=on}} battleship with {{convert|12|in|mm|adj=on}} guns. A later proposal had the new class weighing {{convert|23000|LT|t ST|}} and equipped with {{convert|13.6|in|mm|adj=on}} guns. The last proposal had the battleship weighing as much as {{convert|24100|LT|t ST|}}.<ref name=Sturtonp12/> Despite the first two proposals on the main guns' caliber, the final decision for the caliber was to be a modified and slightly larger version of the original proposal by Skodawerke A.G, with the main turrets to be equipped with {{convert|13.78|in|mm|adj=on|sigfig=4}} to {{convert|13.8|in|mm|adj=on|sigfig=4}} guns.<ref name=Mike>{{cite web|url=http://www.avalanchepress.com/Normandie.php|title=The Normandie-Class Battleships|last=Benninghof|first=Mike|date=November 2008|publisher=Avalanche Press|accessdate=20 May 2010}}</ref> The final design for the main turrets' caliber was influenced by the [[Imperial German Navy]], which had incorporated this caliber on its new [[Mackensen class battlecruiser|''Mackensen''-class]] battlecruisers.<ref name=Andrew/>

By January 1913, the Naval Technical Committee delivered its first official proposal for the new ''Ersatz Monarch''-class battleships. The committee decided to choose the largest of the three initial proposals for the ship's tonnage, with each ship weighing roughly 24,100 tons. The battleships were to be equipped with a total of ten {{convert|13.8|in|mm|adj=on}} 45-caliber guns, eighteen {{convert|5.9|in|mm|adj=on}} 50-caliber guns, and twenty-two {{convert|3.5|in|mm|sigfig=1|adj=on}} 45-caliber guns.<ref name=Andrew/> The main guns were to be between {{convert|13.78|in|mm|sigfig=4}} and {{convert|13.8|in|mm|sigfig=4}}.<ref name=Mike/> It took another year and a half for this final design to be formally approved in July 1914. During this time, a further 12 designs were put forth.<ref name=Andrew/>

==Layout==
===Armament and propulsion===
[[File:SMS Viribus Unitis2.jpg|300px|thumb|right| SMS ''Viribus Unitis'', the ''Ersatz Monarch''-class battleships would have been essentially an enlarged version of their predecessors|alt=A large battleship sits motionless in the water with smoke coming out of it's funnels and three small boats moving beside her in the foreground.|link=File:SMS Viribus Unitis2.jpg]]
The standard weight for the class was to be {{convert|24100|LT|t ST|}} per ship.<ref name=Sokol71>Sokol, p. 71</ref> The ships' length would have been {{convert|574|ft|m}} and the beam {{convert|93.5|ft|m|abbr=on|sigfig=3}} while the draft would have been {{convert|51|ft|m|abbr=on|sigfig=3}}. The four battleships of the ''Ersatz Monarch''-class would have been equipped with four-shaft steam turbines that produced {{convert|31000|shp}} and contained 15 Yarrow water-tube boilers (9 coal-fired and 6 oil-fired).<ref name=Vegop174/> These engines would have enabled the four battleships to travel at {{convert|21|kn|km/h|1}}.<ref name=Vegop174/> Their total range would have been {{convert|5000|nmi|km|-3}} while traveling at {{convert|10|kn|km/h|0}}. Each battleship was to be manned by a crew of 1,050 to 1,100 officers and men. According the approved gun designs from January 1913, the members of the ''Ersatz Monarch''-class would have had ten {{convert|13.8|in|mm|adj=on}} guns,<ref name=Sokol71/> 14 {{convert|6|in|mm|adj=on}} guns, twenty {{convert|3.5|in|mm|adj=on|sigfig=1}} guns, two {{convert|1.85|in|mm|adj=on}} guns, and six {{convert|21.5|in|mm|adj=on}} torpedo tubes.<ref name=Andrew/>

===Armor===
The armor plating on the ships would have been {{convert|12|in|mm|abbr=on}} thick around the belt, barbettes, turrets and the conning tower, while the deck would have had {{convert|2.85|in|mm|adj=on}} thick armor. The underwater defenses of the battleships were a drastic change from previous Austro-Hungarian battleship designs. The new design was similar to recent French and Russian designs. A horizontal armor deck was built into the vessel inwards from the bottom edge of the armor belt, as far as the last vertical bulkheads. The new guns that were approved for the final design were modified to increase the effect of a broadside. However, in order to keep a stable balance between the ships' protection, stability, and firepower, the battleships were to only be equipped with 10 guns. This new layout was unusual, having two turrets with three guns mounted on each of them being superimposed over two twin guns.<ref name=Andrew/>

==Construction and cancellation==
[[File:30,5 cm gesch<U+00FC>tzturm.jpg|thumb|left|The assembly of the first gun turret for SMS ''Viribus Unitis'' at the STT. The assembled guns for the ''Ersatz Monarch''-class were only slightly larger.]]
With the final design in place, four ships from the class were ordered by the Austro-Hungarian Navy in July 1914.<ref name=Robertsp67/><ref name=Sokol71/> The Austro-Hungarian Navy followed the traditional German custom of not naming the new ships until they were formally launched. As a result, the Navy only referred to them as "replacements" for the old ''Monarch''-class ships,<ref name=Robertsp67>Roberts, p. 67</ref> hence the name "Ersatz" (replacement). The four battleships themselves were simply referred to as "Battleships VIII-XI".<ref name=Sturtonp12>Sturton, p. 12</ref> Because several design sketches that all had slight differences were put forth, the exact final appearance of the ships are not known. However, they all would have been built with raised forecastles in order to give them better seaworthiness than their predecessors of the ''Tegetthoff'' class.<ref name=Vegop174/> The battleships would have been equipped with lattice towers that would hold searchlight platforms.<ref name=Andrew/>

Each battleship would have cost about 83 million crowns. The first battleship would have been laid down in July 1914, but this date was later pushed back to September due to the outbreak of World War I at the end of July.<ref name=Andrew/><ref name=Vegop174/> The first battleship, "Battleship VIII," was scheduled to have been completed on 30 June 1917. The second battleship, referred to as "Battleship IX," would have been laid down on 1 January 1915 and launched on 31 December 1917. The third and fourth battleships, "Battleship X" and "Battleship XI," were scheduled to be laid down on 1 June 1916 and completed on 31 May 1919.<ref name=Vegop174>Vego, p. 174</ref>

The main guns were to be built by Skoda, and while the battleships themselves were never laid down, the guns for one battleship had been ordered prior to the beginning of World War I.<ref name=Gregerp26>Greger, p. 26</ref> These were the only orders that the Austro-Hungarian Navy had placed for any part of the four battleships. It was assumed that following a victorious conclusion to the war in just two months, work on the battleships would resume. As the war continued, four of the main guns that were ordered from the Skoda works were handed over to the [[Austro-Hungarian Army]] for use on the Italian front. The rest of the completed main guns were later taken by the French as a war prize following the end of the war. In late 1917, the construction on all four vessels was canceled.<ref name=Andrew/>
