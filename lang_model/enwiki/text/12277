'''Alan''' and '''Michael Perry''' are [[Citadel Miniatures]] designers, and two of the most renowned and prolific sculptors for the [[miniature wargaming]] hobby. They have worked for [[Games Workshop]] since 1978, and during that time they have worked on most of the company's miniature ranges.<ref name="TLA">{{cite web | title = Perry Twins Interview | work = Article | publisher = The Last Alliance | url = http://www.thelastalliance.com/index.php?pid=disparticle&catid=4&subid=24&artilceid=1811 | accessdate = 2007-12-12 }}</ref> They produce many of the [[Miniature figure (gaming)|miniature figures]] used in the company's three core game systems: ''[[Warhammer Fantasy Battles]]'', ''[[Warhammer 40,000]]'' and ''[[The Lord of the Rings Strategy Battle Game]]''.

In addition, they were former sculptors for [[Wargames Foundry]], and run the relatively new company "Perry miniatures", for which they produce historical miniatures.<ref name="Perry Miniatures">{{cite web | title = Perry Miniatures | publisher = Perry Miniatures | work = Website | url = http://www.perry-miniatures.com/index2.html | accessdate = 2007-12-12 }}</ref> They currently live in [[Nottingham]], [[England]].<ref name="OR.net">{{cite web | title = Alan and Michael Perry | publisher = The One Ring.net | work = Short Biography | url = http://haven.theonering.net/current/gw/profile/twins.html | accessdate = 2007-12-12 }}</ref>

==Life==
Alan and Michael are twin brothers, <!--who originate from the [[Enfield]]/[[Waltham Abbey]] area of [[London]].{{Fact|date=December 2007}}--> sometimes referred to either as the '''Perry Brothers'''<ref name="Perry Miniatures"/> or the '''Perry Twins'''.<ref name="TLA"/> They have played wargames since the age of 10, and are avid collectors of antique armour, weapons and other militaria. <ref name="OR.net"/> They studied Art at [[A-levels]],<ref name="TLA"/> and started sculpting freelance for Games Workshop in 1978, while still in school.<ref name="OR.net"/> They joined the company in 1980, and have since become the longest serving members in the Games Workshop Design Studio.<ref name="OR.net"/>

The pair have "a passion for Military History and love to recreate it;"<ref name="TLA"/> they were <!--long time stalwart{{Who|date=December 2007}}--> members of ''Sir Marmadaduke Rawdon's Regiment of Foote'', which is a [[Cavalier|Royalist]] foot regiment of the King's Army, part of the British historical re-enactment group, the [[English Civil War Society]]. They have also belonged to other re-enactment groups. With the help of their friend John Stallard, they published an actual-size, full colour facsimile of a unique officer<U+2019>s handbook, ''The Art of Martiall Discipline'', which had been in their collection for some years.<ref>{{cite web | title = The Art of Martiall Discipline - an English Civil War officer<U+2019>s handbook | publisher = Perry Miniatures | work = Webpage | url = http://www.perry-miniatures.com/theartofmartialldiscipline.htm | accessdate = 2007-12-12 }}</ref>

They look virtually identical, except that Michael lost part of his right arm following an accident loading a reproduction cannon during a re-enactment of the [[Battle of Cr<U+00E9>cy]] in [[France]].<ref name="TLA"/> This was a very serious injury for a right-handed model sculptor, but he learned to sculpt with his left hand.<ref name="TLA"/>

They collaborated on the first four books of [[Warhammer Historical]] with [[Jervis Johnson]] and [[Rick Priestly]], and have said that they "try and fit in a historical game when ever we can."<ref name="TLA"/> Their company, Perry Miniatures, currently produces 12 ranges on different historical themes: [[Samurai]] , [[American War of Independence]], [[Hundred Years War|Agincourt to Orleans]], [[Border Reivers]], [[English Civil War]], [[Napoleonic Wars]], [[The Crusades]], etc.<ref name="Perry Miniatures"/> In all, their miniatures are covered by hundreds of commercial rulesets.<ref name="TLA"/> They have also sculpted a range of 54mm [[World War I]] [[Australian and New Zealand Army Corps|ANZAC]]s for the [[Gallipoli Campaign]] for [[Peter Jackson]]'s private collection.<ref>{{cite web | title = Peter Jackson figures | publisher = Perry Miniatures | work = Webpage | url = http://www.perry-miniatures.com/index2.html | accessdate = 2007-12-12 }}</ref>

They have described the illustrator [[John Howe]] as an "old friend", and share an interest in miniature wargaming and military history with [[The Lord of the Rings film trilogy|''The Lord of the Rings'' film]] director [[Peter Jackson]].<ref name="TLA"/>

They also had a [[cameo appearance]] in [[Return of the King (film)|''The Return of the King'' film]] as [[Rohirrim]] at the [[Battle of the Pelennor Fields]], alongside Games Workshop designers [[Alessio Cavatore]] and [[Brian Nelson]].<ref name="Perry Miniatures"/> They can be seen near the [[Oliphaunt]] when [[Peregrin Took]] goes searching for [[Meriadoc Brandybuck]] among the debris from the battle, and are also on the base of Games Workshop's M<U+00FB>mak miniature.<ref name="TLA"/><ref>{{cite web | title = Painting a Mumak | publisher = Games Workshop | work = Article | url = http://uk.games-workshop.com/harad/painting-mumak/1/ | accessdate = 2007-06-18 }}</ref>

Alan and Michael Perry "have been heavily involved in every [[The Lord of the Rings Strategy Battle Game|The Lord of The Rings]] project that Games Workshop has undertaken," which comprises their current work at Games Workshop.<ref>{{cite web | title = Forging the Fellowship | publisher = Games Workshop | work = Article | url = http://uk.games-workshop.com/thefellowshipofthering/designers-notes/2/ | accessdate = 2007-12-12 }}</ref> They expressed excitement when they were first asked, as it would allow them to "work on more true-to-life proportioned figures which is what we prefer."<ref name="TLA"/> As with their sculpting for other miniature ranges, they always work on sculpting miniatures separately and "only occasionally combine on plastic projects."<ref name="TLA"/>
