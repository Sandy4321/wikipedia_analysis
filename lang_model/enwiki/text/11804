The '''House of Lancaster''' was a [[cadet branch]] of the royal [[House of Plantagenet]].Founded by [[Edmund Crouchback]] the second son of [[Henry III of England]]. Henry created Edmund Earl of Leicester in 1265 and Earl of Lancaster, from which the house was named, in 1267. These titles also came with the lands and privileges of [[Simon de Montfort, 6th Earl of Leicester]] after de Montfort<U+2019>s death and [[attainder]] at the end of the [[Second Barons' War]]. <ref name=Weir2008>{{harvnb|Weir|2008|p=75}}</ref> It was through descent from Edmund that the three Lancastrian monarch<U+2019>s legitimatised their reigns. <ref name=Weir1995>{{harvnb|Weir|1995|p=40}}</ref> At a stroke when Edmund<U+2019>s son, Thomas, inherited his father-in-laws title of Earl of Lincoln and estates he became the most powerful nobleman in England with lands throughout the kingdom and the ability to raise vast private armies to wield power at national and local level.<ref name=Jones2012p371>{{harvnb|Jones|2012|pp=371}}</ref>
This brought conflict with their cousin [[Edward II of England]] before they gave loyal service to his son [[Edward III of England]]. Edward III married his sons to wealthy heiresses of his subjects. As part of this he married his son John to his third cousin Blanche of Lancaster to give him the vast wealth of the House of Lancaster which some take as the founding of the Royal House. Henry, their son, usurped the throne in 1399 thereby creating one of the factions in the [[Wars of the Roses]]. These were an intermittent dynastic struggle between the descendants of Edward III. In these wars the term Lancastrian became a reference to both members of the family and their supporters. The family provided England with three kings: [[Henry IV of England]], who ruled 1399<U+2013>1413; [[Henry V of England]], who ruled 1413<U+2013>1422; and [[Henry VI of England]] and ([[Dual monarchy of England and France|II of) France]], who ruled 1422<U+2013>1461 and 1470<U+2013>1471. The House became extinct on the execution of the son of the last Lancastrian King and the murder of the King himself by supporters of the House of York in 1471.

==Origin of the Earls of Lancaster==

{{main|Earl of Lancaster|Edmund Crouchback|Thomas, 2nd Earl of Lancaster}}
[[File:Thomas of Lancaster posessions.png|thumb|left|Thomas of Lancaster's main possessions (Maddicott)]]

After [[Henry III of England]]<U+2019>s royalist forces had suppressed opposition from the English nobility in the [[Second Barons' War]], he granted to his second son, [[Edmund Crouchback]], the titles and possessions forfeited by [[attainder]] of the Barons<U+2019> leader, [[Simon de Montfort, 6th Earl of Leicester]]. Edmund was created [[Earl of Leicester]] on 26 October 1265, [[Earl of Lancaster|Lancaster]] on 30 June 1267 from which the House has been named, Count of Champagne and Brie in 1276 by right of his wife and [[Earl Ferrers|Earl Ferrers (Derby)]] in 1301.<ref name=Weir2008>{{harvnb|Weir|2008|p=75}}</ref> [[Henry IV of England]] would later use his descent from Edmund to legitimise his claim to the throne even going as far to make the spurious claim that Edmund was the elder son of Henry but had been passed over as king due to his deformity. <ref name=Weir1995>{{harvnb|Weir|1995|p=40}}</ref>

Edmund's second marriage to [[Blanche of Artois]] placed him at the centre of the European aristocracy. She was the widow of [[Henry I of Navarre|the King of Navarre]]. Her daughter, Edmund's step daughter [[Joan I of Navarre]] was queen regent of Navarre and on her marriage to [[Philip IV of France]] also queen consort of France.  When Edmund's son [[Thomas, 2nd Earl of Lancaster|Thomas]] married the heiress of [[Henry de Lacy, 3rd Earl of Lincoln]] he inherited the further Earldoms of [[Earl of Lincoln|Lincoln]] and [[Earl of Salisbury|Salisbury]] becoming the most powerful nobleman in England. His income was <U+00A3>11,000 per annum, double that of the next most senior Earl.<ref name=Jones2012p371>{{harvnb|Jones|2012|pp=371}}</ref>

Thomas and [[Henry, 3rd Earl of Lancaster|Henry]] served in the [[Coronation of the British monarch|coronation]] of his cousin, King [[Edward II of England]] on 25 February 1308 with Thomas carrying a great sword and Henry the royal sceptre. <ref name=Jones2012p363>{{harvnb|Jones|2012|pp=363}}</ref> After supporting Edward, Thomas became was one of the [[Lords Ordainers]] who demanded the banishment of [[Piers Gaveston]] and the governance of the realm by a baronial council. After Gaveston was captured Thomas took the lead in his trial and execution at Warwick in 1312. <ref name=Jones2012p375>{{harvnb|Jones|2012|pp=375-378}}</ref> Edward's authority was weakened by poor governance and the defeat at  the [[Battle of Bannockburn]] allowing Thomas to republish [[Ordinances of 1311]] restraining Edwards power. However, this was seen by Thomas as an end it itself and he took little part in the practical governance of the realm, instead retreating back to the north and [[Pontefract Castle]].<ref name=Jones2012p390>{{harvnb|Jones|2012|p=390}}</ref> This allowed Edward to regroup and rearm leading to a fragile peace in August 1318 with the [[Treaty of Leake]]. Edward<U+2019>s rule collapsed into anarchy again in 1321 and Thomas raised a northern army but was defeated and captured at the [[Battle of Boroughbridge]]. In a show trial he was sentenced to be hanged, drawn and quartered but as Edward<U+2019>s cousin this was commuted to beheading.<ref name=Jones2012p400>{{harvnb|Jones|2012|p=400}}</ref >  
Thomas<U+2019>s younger brother [[Henry, 3rd Earl of Lancaster|Henry]] joined the revolt of Edward' s Queen [[Isabella of France]] and her lover, [[Roger Mortimer, 1st Earl of March]], in 1326, pursuing and capturing the king at [[Neath]] in [[South Wales]]. <ref name=Jones2012p400>{{harvnb|Jones|2012|p=400}}</ref>  Following Edward<U+2019>s deposition and murder Parliament posthumously reversed Thomas's conviction and Henry regained possession of the Earldoms of Lancaster, Derby, Salisbury and Lincoln that had been forfeit for Thomas<U+2019>s treason. It would be Henry who would knight the young King [[Edward III of England]] before his coronation.<ref name=Jones2012p422>{{harvnb|Jones|2012|p=422}}</ref >  However faced with Mortimer<U+2019>s increasingly dictatorial rule in 1328 and 1329 Henry led the opposition before Edward was able to assume control. <ref name=Jones2012p468>{{harvnb|Jones|2012|p=468}}</ref>

== Duchy and Palatinate of Lancaster ==

{{main| Henry, 3rd Earl of Lancaster | Henry of Grosmont, 1st Duke of Lancaster | County palatine }}

Henry's son, also called [[Henry of Grosmont, 1st Duke of Lancaster|Henry]] was born at the castle of [[Grosmont, Monmouthshire|Grosmont]] in [[Monmouthshire]] between 1299 and 1314.<ref name=Weir200877>{{harvnb|Weir|2008|p=77}}</ref> According to his memoirs he was better at [[Historical European martial arts|martial arts]] than academic subjects and did not learn to read until later in life.<ref name=fowler26>{{harvnb|Fowler|1969|p=26}}</ref> Henry was co-eval with Edward and was pivotal to his reign becoming his best friend and most trusted commander.<ref name="Jones2012p471b">{{harvnb|Jones|2012|p=471}}</ref> He was knighted in 1330, represented his father in [[Parliament of England|parliament]] and took part in Edward's [[Scotland|Scottish]] campaign.<ref name=fowler30>{{harvnb|Fowler|1969|p=30}}</ref>  After the outbreak of the [[Hundred Years' War]] he took part in several diplomatic missions and minor campaigns and was present at the great English victory in the naval [[Battle of Sluys]] in 1340.<ref name=fowler34>{{harvnb|Fowler|1969|p=34}}</ref> Later,  he was required to commit himself as hostage in the [[Low Countries]] for the king's considerable debts, remaining hostage for a year and having to pay a large ransom for his own release.<ref name=fowler35>{{harvnb|Fowler|1969|pp=35<U+2013>37}}</ref>  
In 1345 Edward III was planning a major assault on France. A three-pronged attack would have the [[William de Bohun, 1st Earl of Northampton|Earl of Northampton]] attacking from [[Brittany]], the king himself from [[Flanders]], while Grosmont was dispatched to [[Aquitaine]] to prepare a campaign in the south. .<ref name=Jones2012p471b>{{harvnb|Jones|2012|p=471}}</ref> Moving rapidly through the country, he confronted the [[Bertrand I, 1st Comte de l'Isle|Comte d'Isle]] at the [[Battle of Auberoche]] and achieved a victory described as "the greatest single achievement of Lancaster's entire military career".<ref name=fowler58>{{harvnb|Fowler|1969|pp=58<U+2013>59}}</ref> The ransom from the prisoners has been estimated at <U+00A3>50,000.<ref name=fowler61>{{harvnb|Fowler|1969|p=61}}</ref>  In reward for this and later service in the war the king honoured Henry by including him as a founding knight of the [[Order of the Garter]].<ref name=McKisack>{{harvnb|McKisack|1959|pp=252}}</ref> An even greater honour was bestowed on Lancaster when he created him [[Duke of Lancaster]]. The title of [[duke]] was of relatively new origin in England; only one other ducal title existed previously. In addition to this, Lancaster was given [[County palatine|palatinate]] status for the county of [[Lancashire]], which entailed a separate administration independent of the crown.<ref name=fowler173>{{harvnb|Fowler|1969|pp=173<U+2013>174}}</ref> This grant was quite exceptional in English history; only two other counties palatine existed: [[County Durham|Durham]], which was an ancient ecclesiastical palatinate, and [[Chester]], which was crown property. It is a sign of Edward's high regard for Lancaster that he would bestow such extensive privileges on him. In 1350 Henry was present at the naval victory at [[Battle of Les Espagnols sur Mer|Winchelsea]] where he saved the life of the [[Edward, the Black Prince|Black Prince]].<ref name=fowler193>{{harvnb|Fowler|1969|pp=193<U+2013>195}}</ref>  He spent  1351-2 on [[Northern Crusades|crusade]] in [[Old Prussians|Prussia]] where a quarrel with [[Otto the Mild, Duke of Brunswick-L<U+00FC>neburg|Otto, Duke of Brunswick]] almost led to a duel between the two men only averted by the intervention of the French king, [[John II of France|John II]].<ref name=fowler106>{{harvnb|Fowler|1969|pp=106<U+2013>109}}</ref> As campaigning in France resumed Henry participated in the last great offensive of the first phase of the Hundred Years' War: the [[Rheims]] campaign of 1359<U+2013>60 before returning to England where he fell ill and died at [[Leicester Castle]], most likely of the [[Bubonic plague|plague]].<ref name=fowler106>{{harvnb|Fowler|1969|pp=217<U+2013>218}}</ref> [[Edward III of England]] had married his third surviving son, [[John of Gaunt, 1st Duke of Lancaster|John of Gaunt]] to Henry's heiress [[Blanche of Lancaster]]. On Henry's death Edward conferred on Gaunt the second creation of the title of [[Duke of Lancaster]] which made Gaunt the wealthiest landowner in England after the King. Gaunt enjoyed great political influence during his lifetime, but upon his death in 1399, his lands were confiscated by [[Richard II of England|Richard II]]. Gaunt's exiled son and heir [[Henry IV of England|Henry of Bolingbroke]] returned home the same year with an army to reclaim the Lancaster estates, but ended up riding a tide of popular opposition to Richard II that saw him take control of the Kingdom. Richard II was deposed and died in captivity, and Bolingbroke was declared King Henry IV of England.<ref name=Jones2012p586>{{harvnb|Jones|2012|pp=586<U+2013>592}}</ref>

== The reign of [[Henry IV of England|Henry IV]] ==

{{main|Henry IV of England}}

 [[File:Schlacht von Azincourt.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Battle of Agincourt]] fought on [[Saint Crispin|Saint Crispin's Day]].]]
Henry's accession by force broke the principles of Plantagenet succession; from this point any magnate with sufficient power and Plantagenet blood could consider the throne His assertion that his mother had legitimate rights through descent from [[Edmund Crouchback]], whom he claimed was the elder son of Henry III of England, set aside due to deformity, was not widely believed. [[Edmund Mortimer, 5th Earl of March|Edmund Mortimer, Earl of March]], was the heir presumptive to Richard II by being the grandson of [[Lionel of Antwerp, 1st Duke of Clarence]], but as a child he wasn't considered a serious contender and as an adult never showed any interest in the throne, instead serving the House of Lancaster loyally. When [[Richard of Conisburgh, 3rd Earl of Cambridge]], later [[Southampton Plot|plotted]] to use him to displace Henry's newly crowned son, and their mutual cousin, he informed the new King and the plotters were executed. However, the marriage of his [[Anne de Mortimer|sister]] to Conisborough, son of [[Edward III of England|Edward III]]'s fourth son [[Edmund of Langley]] consolidated the Mortimers' claim to the throne with that of the more junior [[House of York]].<ref name=Weir1995>{{harvnb|Weir|1995|p=235}}</ref>

Henry planned to resume war with France, but was plagued with financial problems, declining health and frequent rebellions.<ref name=mortimer353>{{harvnb|Mortimer|2003|p=353}}</ref> A Scottish invasion was defeated at the [[Battle of Homildon Hill]], but it resulted in a long war with [[Henry Percy, 1st Earl of Northumberland]], for northern England, which was resolved only with the near complete destruction of the [[House of Percy|Percy family]] at the [[Battle of Bramham Moor]].<ref name=mortimer253>{{harvnb|Mortimer|2003|pp=253<U+2013>264}}</ref> In Wales [[Owain Glynd<U+0175>r]]'s widespread rebellion was only put down in 1408.<ref name=Weir1995p50>{{harvnb|Weir|1995|p=50}}</ref> So many saw it as a punishment from God when Henry was later struck down with [[leprosy]] and [[epilepsy]].<ref>{{harvnb|Swanson|1995|p=298}}.</ref>

Henry IV was succeeded by his son [[Henry V of England|Henry V]], and eventually by his grandson [[Henry VI of England|Henry VI]] in 1422.

==Henry V and the Hundred Years' War <U+2013> the Lancastrian war==
{{Main|Hundred Years' War (1415<U+2013>1453)|Henry V of England}}

[[Henry V of England]] was a successful and ruthless monarch. <ref name=Schama2656>{{harvnb|Schama|2000|pp=265-266}}</ref> He was quick to resume the Hundreds<U+2019> Year War to re-assert the claim to the French throne he inherited from Edward III. The war was not a formal continuous conflict but an occasion for English raids and military expeditions from 1337 until 1453. There were six major royal expeditions, with Henry himself leading the fifth and sixth, but these was less typical of the smaller frequent provincial campaigns. <ref name=Davies419>{{harvnb|Davies|1997|pp=419-420}}</ref> In Henry<U+2019>s first major campaign, and the fifth major royal campaign of the war, he invaded France, captured [[Harfleur]], made a [[chevauch<U+00E9>e]] to [[Calais]] and won a near total victory over the French at the [[Battle of Agincourt]], despite being outnumbered, outmanoeuvred and low on supplies.<ref name=Schama265 >{{harvnb|Schama|2000|p=265}}</ref> In his second campaign, he recaptured much of Normandy and in a treaty secured a marriage to [[Catherine of Valois]]. The terms of the [[Treaty of Troyes]] were Henry and Catherine's heirs would succeed to the throne of France. However, this was contested by the [[Charles VII of France|Dauphin]] and the momentum of the war turned. [[Thomas, Duke of Clarence]], Henry<U+2019>s brother, was killed in the defeat at the [[battle of Baug<U+00E9>]] in 1421 before Henry, himself, died of dysentery at [[Vicennes]]. <ref name=Weir2008p133>{{harvnb|Weir|2008|pp=133}}</ref>
[[Henry VI of England]] was less than a year old but the boy Kings uncle's continued the campaign led by Henry V's brother [[John of Lancaster, 1st Duke of Bedford]]. There were several more victories, such as the [[Battle of Verneuil]], in 1424, but it was impossible to maintain campaigning at this level. [[Joan of Arc]]'s involvement helped force the lifting of the siege of Orleans.<ref name=Davies76>{{harvnb|Davies|1999|pp=76<U+2013>80}}</ref> French victory at the [[Battle of Patay]] and the Dauphin was crowned  after which he continued the successful [[Fabian tactics]], avoiding full frontal assaults and exploiting logistical advantage.

[[File:Siege orleans.jpg|thumb|left|The first Western image of a battle with cannon: the [[Siege of Orleans]] in 1429]]
During the minority of Henry VI the war caused political division between the Lancastrians and the other Plantagenets. Bedford wanted to defend Normandy, [[Humphrey of Lancaster, 1st Duke of Gloucester]], just Calais, but [[Cardinal Beaufort]] wanted peace.<ref name=Weir1995p72>{{harvnb|Weir|1995|pp=72<U+2013>76}}</ref> This division led to Gloucester's wife being accused of using witchcraft with the aim of putting him on the throne and he was later arrested and died in prison.<ref name=Weir1995p122>{{harvnb|Weir|1995|pp=122<U+2013>32}}</ref> The Lancastrian refusal to renounce the claim to the French crown at the [[Treaty of Arras (1435)|congress of Arras]] led to the defection of their ally [[Philip III, Duke of Burgundy]] to Charles and gave him time to reorganise his feudal levies into a modern professional army that put its superior numbers to good use.<ref name=Weir1995p86>{{harvnb|Weir|1995|pp=86,101}}</ref> The French retook Rouen and Bordeaux, regained Normandy, won the [[Battle of Formigny]] in 1450<ref name=Weir1995p156>{{harvnb|Weir|1995|pp=156}}</ref> and with victory at the [[Battle of Castillon]] in 1453 brought an end to the war with the result that all the Lancastrian holdings in France, except Calais and the Channel Islands, were lost forever.<ref name=Weir1995p172>{{harvnb|Weir|1995|pp=172}}</ref>

Henry VI proved to be a weak king vulnerable to the over-mighty subjects who developed private armies of retainers. Rivalries often spilled over from the courtroom into armed confrontation such as [[Percy<U+2013>Neville feud]].<ref name=Schama266>{{harvnb|Schama|2000|p=266}}</ref> The common purpose of the war in France had ended and Henry's cousin, Richard, Duke of York, and [[Richard Neville, 16th Earl of Warwick]] used their networks to defy the crown. Henry became the focus of discontent, as population, agricultural production, prices, wool trade and credit declined in the [[Great Slump (15th century)|Great Slump]].<ref name=Hicks44>{{harvnb|Hicks|2010|p=44}}</ref> Most seriously, in 1450 [[Jack Cade]] raised a rebellion in an attempt to force the King to address economic problems or abdicate his throne.<ref name=Weir147>{{harvnb|Weir|1995|pp=147<U+2013>155}}</ref> The uprising was suppressed, but remained deeply unsettling with more radical demands coming from [[John and William Merfold]].<ref name=Mate156>{{harvnb|Mate|2006|p=156}}</ref>

==Fall of The House of Lancaster==
{{main|Wars of the Roses|Henry VI of England| House of York }}
[[File:Choosing the Red and White Roses.jpg|right|thumb|Symbolic representation of the [[Wars of the Roses]] in art]]
Henry's marriage to [[Margaret of Anjou]] prompted criticism from [[Richard Plantagenet, Duke of York]] because it included the surrender of Maine and an extended the truce with France. York was Henry's cousin through his descent from two of Edward III sons, [[Lionel of Antwerp, 1st Duke of Clarence]] and [[Edmund of Langley|Edmund, Duke of York]]. This gave York political influence but he was removed from English and French politics through his appointment as [[Lord Lieutenant of Ireland]].<ref name="croftonrichduke">{{harvnb|Crofton|2007|p=112}}.</ref> Conscious of the fate of Henry's Uncle Humphrey at the hands of the Beauforts and suspicious that Henry intended to nominate [[Edmund Beaufort, 2nd Duke of Somerset]] as heir presumptive York recruited militarily on his return to England. Armed conflict was avoided because York lacked aristocratic support and he was forced to swear allegiance to Henry. However, when Henry later had a mental breakdown York was named regent. Henry himself was trusting and not a man of war, but Margaret was more assertive, showing open enmity toward York particularly after the birth of a male heir that resolved the succession question and assured her position.<ref name="croftonrichdukeeleven">{{harvnb|Crofton|2007|p=111}}.</ref>

When Henry's sanity returned the court party reasserted its authority, but York and his relatives, the Nevilles, defeated them at a skirmish called the [[First Battle of St Albans]]. Possibly as few as 50 men were killed, but among them were Somerset and the two Percy lords, [[Henry Percy, 2nd Earl of Northumberland]], and [[Thomas Clifford, 8th Baron de Clifford]], creating feuds that would confound reconciliation attempts despite the shock that armed conflict had been to ruling class.<ref>{{harvnb|Goodman|1981|p=25}}.</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Goodman|1981|p=31}}.</ref> Threatened with treason charges and lacking support, York, [[Richard Neville, 5th Earl of Salisbury]], and Richard Neville, 16th Earl of Warwick, fled abroad. Henry was captured by the opposition when the Nevilles returned, winning the [[Battle of Northampton (1460)|Battle of Northampton]].<ref>{{harvnb|Goodman|1981|p=38}}.</ref> When York joined them he surprised Parliament by claiming the throne and then forcing through the [[Act of Accord]]. This stated that Henry would remain as monarch for his lifetime, but that York would succeed after him. The disinheriting of [[Edward of Westminster, Prince of Wales|Henry's son Edward]] was unacceptable to so continuing conflict was inevitable. York was killed at the [[Battle of Wakefield]] and his head set on display at [[Micklegate Bar]], [[York]] along with those of [[Edmund, Earl of Rutland]], and Richard Neville, Earl of Salisbury, who had both been captured and beheaded.<ref name=Weir257>{{harvnb|Weir|1995|p=257}}</ref>

Margaret gained the support of the Scottish queen [[Mary of Guelders]] and with a Scottish army pillaged into southern England.<ref>{{harvnb|Goodman|1981|p=57}}.</ref> However, this caused London to fear being plundered and the city enthusiastically welcomed York's son [[Edward IV of England|Edward, Earl of March]] as King.<ref name="crowned">{{harvnb|Goodman|1981|p=1}}.</ref> Margaret's defeat  at the [[Battle of Towton]] confirmed Edward's position and he was crowned.<ref>{{harvnb|Goodman|1981|p=147}}.</ref> However, his marriage to [[Elizabeth Woodville]] and preferment of her formerly Lancastrian-supporting led to the defection of Warwick and Clarence to Henry's cause.  The alliance was sealed with the marriage of Henry's son, Edward, to Warwick's daughter, Anne. Edward and [[Richard III of England|Richard, Duke of Gloucester]] fled England. When they returned Clarence switched sides at the [[Battle of Barnet]] and Warwick and his brother were killed. Before Henry, Margaret and Edward of Lancaster could escape back to France they were caught at the [[Battle of Tewkesbury]].  [[Edward of Westminster, Prince of Wales]] was executed on the battlefield and the last of the Beauforts were killed. The captive Henry was murdered on 21 May 1471 in the [[Tower of London]] and buried in Chertsey Abbey, extinguishing the House of Lancaster.<ref name=End>{{harvnb|Weir|2008|p=134}}</ref>

==Legacy==

[[File:Cambridge King's College Chapel 2011 03.jpg|thumb|[[King's College Chapel, Cambridge]]]]

Lancastrian cognatic descent from John of Gaunt and Blanche's daughter Phillipa continued in the royal houses of Spain and Portugal.<ref name=Phillipa>{{harvnb|Weir|2008|p=100}}</ref> However, the remnants of the Lancastrian court party coalesced support around [[Henry VII of England|Henry Tudor]], albeit a relatively unknown scion of the [[Beaufort family|Beauforts]]. They had been amongst the most ardent supporters of the House of Lancaster and were descended from John of Gaunt by his mistress [[Katherine Swynford]]. With the House of Lancaster extinct Henry claimed to be the Lancastrian heir through his mother [[Lady Margaret Beaufort]]. On the paternal side his father had been Henry VI's maternal half-brother. In 1485 Henry Tudor united increasing opposition within England to the reign of [[King Richard III of England|Richard III]] with the Lancastrian cause to take the throne. To legitimise his questionable claim, Henry married the daughter of [[Edward IV of England]], [[Elizabeth of York]] and promoted the [[House of Tudor]] as a dynasty of dual Lancastrian and Yorkist descent.<ref name=Tudor>{{harvnb|Weir|2008|pp=146<U+2013>149}}</ref>

Henry VI founded both [[Eton College]] and [[King's College, Cambridge]] leaving a lasting educational legacy. This followed the architectural patronage begun by his [[Henry V of England#Final words and legacy|father]], such as [[King's College Chapel, Cambridge|King's College Chapel]] and [[Eton College Chapel]].<ref name=Eton>{{harvnb|Weir|1995|p=94}}</ref>
