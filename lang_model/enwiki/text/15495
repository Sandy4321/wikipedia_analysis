'''Bartitsu''' is an eclectic [[martial art]] and [[self-defence]] method originally developed in [[England]] during the years 1898<U+2013>1902. In 1901 it was immortalised (as "baritsu") by Sir [[Arthur Conan Doyle]], author of the [[Sherlock Holmes]] mystery stories.<ref>{{cite news|title= SHERLOCK Ho-Ho-HOLMES: A Great Christmas Gift?|work= Kung Fu Magazine|date=|url=http://ezine.kungfumagazine.com/ezine/article.php?article=865|accessdate=2009-12-27}}</ref> Although dormant throughout most of the 20th Century, Bartitsu has been experiencing a revival since 2002.<ref name="Godfrey, 2009" >{{cite journal

== History ==
In 1898, [[Edward William Barton-Wright]], a [[British people|British]] [[engineer]] who had spent the previous three years living in the [[Empire of Japan]], returned to [[England]] and announced the formation of a "New Art of Self Defence".<ref name="Wolf, 2007" >{{cite web

  |title=The Origins of Bartitsu
}}</ref> This art, he claimed, combined the best elements of a range of fighting styles into a unified whole, which he had named Bartitsu. The word was a [[portmanteau]] of his own surname and of "[[jujutsu|Jujitsu]]", and Barton-Wright defined it as meaning "self defence in all its forms".<ref name="Wolf, 2005" >{{cite book

As detailed in a series of articles Barton-Wright produced for ''Pearson's Magazine'' between 1899 and 1901, Bartitsu was largely drawn from the [[Shinden Fudo Ryu|Shinden Fudo Ryu Taijutsu]] and from [[Kodokan Judo]], both of which he had studied while resident in Japan.  As it became established in London, the art expanded to incorporate combat techniques from the [[Tenjin Shiny<U+014D>-ry<U+016B>|Tenjin Shiny<U+014D>]], [[Fusen Ryu|Fusen]] and [[Daito-ryu aiki-jujutsu|Daito]] schools of jujutsu as well as British [[boxing]], Swiss [[schwingen]], French [[savate]], and a defensive [[Canne de combat|la canne]] ([[stick fighting]]) style that had been developed by [[Pierre Vigny]] of Switzerland.  Bartitsu also included a comprehensive [[physical culture]] training system.

In 1902, Barton-Wright wrote:<ref name="Barton-Wright, 1902" >{{cite journal

{{quote|Under Bartitsu is included boxing, or the use of the fist as a hitting medium, the use of the feet both in an offensive and defensive sense, the use of the walking stick as a means of self-defence. Judo and jujitsu, which were secret styles of Japanese wrestling, he would call close play as applied to self-defence. 

In order to ensure as far as it was possible immunity against injury in cowardly attacks or quarrels, they must understand boxing in order to thoroughly appreciate the danger and rapidity of a well-directed blow, and the particular parts of the body which were scientifically attacked. The same, of course, applied to the use of the foot or the stick. 

Judo and jujitsu were not designed as primary means of attack and defence against a boxer or a man who kicks you, but were only to be used after coming to close quarters, and in order to get to close quarters it was absolutely necessary to understand boxing and the use of the foot.}}

== Bartitsu Club ==
Between 1899 and 1902, Barton-Wright set about publicizing his art through magazine articles, interviews and a series of demonstrations or "assaults at arms" at various [[London]] venues. He established a school called the Bartitsu Academy of Arms and Physical Culture, known informally as the Bartitsu Club, which was located at 67b [[Shaftesbury Avenue]] in [[Soho]]. In an article for ''[[Eugen Sandow|Sandow's Magazine of Physical Culture]]'' vol. 6, (January 1901), journalist Mary Nugent described the Bartitsu Club as "... a huge subterranean hall, all glittering, white-tiled walls, and electric light, with 'champions' prowling around it like tigers."<ref name="Nugent, Sandow's, 1901" >{{cite journal

Via correspondence with Professor [[Jigoro Kano]], the founder of Kodokan Judo, and other contacts in Japan,  Barton-Wright arranged for Japanese jujutsu practitioners K. Tani, S. Yamamoto and the nineteen year old [[Yukio Tani]] to travel to London and serve as instructors at the Bartitsu Club.  K. Tani and Yamamoto soon returned to Japan, but Yukio Tani stayed and was shortly joined by another young jujutsuka, [[Sadakazu Uyenishi]].  Swiss master-at-arms [[Pierre Vigny]] and wrestler Armand Cherpillod were also employed as teachers at the Club.  As well as teaching well-to-do Londoners, their duties included performing demonstrations and competing in challenge matches against fighters representing other combat styles.<ref name="Sandow's, 1902" >{{cite journal

}}</ref> In addition, the Club became the headquarters for a group of [[fencing]] [[antiquarians]] led by Captain [[Alfred Hutton]] and it served as their base for experimenting with [[historical fencing]] techniques, which they taught to members of London's acting elite for use in [[stage combat]].<ref name="Wolf, 2005" />

In mid-1901, the curriculum of Bartitsu was further expanded to include breathing exercises under the tuition of Mrs. Emil Behnke.<ref name="Behnke, 1901" >{{cite journal

}}</ref>

As well as the combat gymnasium, the Bartitsu Club incorporated a well-appointed salon equipped with a wide range of [[electrotherapy]] machines.

The Club was organised on the model of the Victorian sporting club; prospective members submitted their applications to a committee, which at one time included both [[Captain Alfred Hutton]] and Colonel George Malcolm Fox, former Inspector-General of the [[British Army]]'s Physical Training Corps. Promoters of the Club included politicians [[Herbert Gladstone]] and [[Lord Alwyne Compton]].

Bartitsu Club membership included [[Cosmo Duff Gordon|Sir Cosmo Duff Gordon]], who was later to achieve notoriety as one of the few adult male survivors of the sinking of the [[RMS Titanic]], as well as Captain F.C. Laing of the 12th Bengal Infantry, who subsequently wrote an article on Bartitsu stick fighting techniques which was published in the ''Journal of the United Service Institution of India''.<ref name="Laing, " >{{cite web

}}</ref> Other Club members included Percy Rolt and Captains Ernest George Stenson Cooke and Frank Herbert Whittow, both also members of the London Rifle Brigade School of Arms, under the direction of Captain Hutton; and also [[William Henry Grenfell]], the 1st Baron Desborough.

Barton-Wright later reported that, during this period, he had challenged and defeated seven larger men within three minutes as part of a Bartitsu demonstration he gave at St. James's Hall.  He said this feat earned him a membership in the prestigious [[List of London's gentlemen's clubs|Bath Club]] and also a Royal Command to appear before [[Edward VII of the United Kingdom|Edward, Prince of Wales]].<ref name="koizumi, 1950" >{{cite journal

== Self defence ==
Barton-Wright encouraged members of the Bartitsu Club to study each of the four major hand-to-hand combat styles taught at the Club, each of which broadly corresponded to a different "range" of personal combat.  The goal was to master each style well enough that they could be used against the others if needed. This process was similar to the modern concept of [[cross-training]] and it can be argued that Bartitsu itself was more in the nature of a cross-training system than a formal martial arts style.

In 1899, Barton-Wright summarised the essential principles of Bartitsu as:

1. To disturb the equilibrium of your assailant.
2. To surprise him before he has time to regain his balance and use his strength.
3. If necessary, to subject the joints of any parts of his body, whether neck, shoulder, elbow, wrist, back, knee, ankle, etc. to strains that they are anatomically and mechanically unable to resist.

Based on Barton-Wright's writings upon this subject, contemporary researchers believe that Bartitsu placed greatest emphasis upon the Vigny cane fighting system at the striking range and upon jujutsu (and, secondarily, the "all-in" style of European wrestling) at the grappling range.  Savate and boxing methods were used to [[segue]] between these two ranges, or as a means of first response should the defender not be armed with a walking stick. These sports were also practiced so that Bartitsu students could learn how to defend against them through the use of jujutsu and Vigny stick fighting. Barton-Wright was reported to have modified the techniques of both boxing and savate for self defence purposes, as distinct from academic and fitness training or sporting competition.<ref name="Wolf, 2005"/>

According to interviewer Mary Nugent, Barton-Wright instituted an unusual pedagogical system whereby students were first required to attend private training sessions before being allowed to join class groups.<ref name="Nugent, Health and Strength, 1901" /> It is evident that Bartitsu classes included pre-arranged exercises, especially for use in rehearsing those techniques that were too dangerous to be performed at full speed or contact, as well as [[Aliveness (martial arts)|free-sparring and fencing bouts]].<ref name="Wolf, 2005"/>

Many Bartitsu self defence techniques and training sequences were recorded by Barton-Wright himself in his series of articles for ''Pearson's Magazine.''<ref name="Barton-Wright, Pearson's, March 1899" >[[#Barton-Wright, Pearson's, March 1899|Pearson's, March 1899]]</ref><ref name="Barton-Wright, Pearson's, April 1899" >[[#Barton-Wright, Pearson's, April 1899|Pearson's, April 1899]]</ref><ref name="Barton-Wright, Pearson's, February 1901" >[[#Barton-Wright, Pearson's, February 1901|Pearson's, February 1901]]</ref> The specific details of other Bartitsu stick fighting training drills were recorded in Captain Laing's article.

== Decline ==
Despite his enthusiasm, Barton-Wright seems to have been a mediocre promoter. By 1903, the Bartitsu Club had closed its doors for the last time; subsequent speculation by former Club member Percy Longhurst suggested that both the enrollment and tuition fees had been too high.

Most of Barton-Wright's former employees, including jujutsuka Yukio Tani and Sadakazu Uyenishi and Swiss self defence expert Pierre Vigny, established their own self defence and combat sports gymnasiums in London. After breaking with Barton-Wright, purportedly due to an argument and a fight, Tani also continued his work as a professional [[music-hall]] wrestler under the shrewd management of William Bankier, a strength performer and magazine publisher who went by the stage name of "Apollo".  Bankier's promotional efforts helped to spur the international [[fad]] for jujutsu that Barton-Wright had begun, and which included the publication of numerous books and magazine articles as well as the establishment of jujutsu schools throughout the Western world. This fad lasted until the beginning of [[World War I]] and served to introduce jujutsu into Western [[popular culture]].<ref name="koizumi, 1950" />

Although Barton-Wright was rumoured to have continued to develop and teach his martial art at least until the 1920s, it never again returned to prominence.

== "Baritsu" and Sherlock Holmes==
{{main|Baritsu}}
Bartitsu might have been completely forgotten if not for a cryptic reference by [[Sir Arthur Conan Doyle]] in one of his [[Sherlock Holmes]] mystery stories.  In 1901 Conan Doyle had revived Holmes for a further story, ''[[The Adventure of the Empty House]]'', in which Holmes explained his victory over [[Professor Moriarty]] in their struggle at [[Reichenbach Falls]] by the use of "''baritsu'', or the Japanese system of wrestling, which has more than once been very useful to me".    

The term "baritsu" did not exist outside the pages of the English editions of ''The Adventure of the Empty House''. It is possible that Conan Doyle, who, like E.W. Barton-Wright, was writing for Pearson<U+2019>s Magazine during the late 1890s, was vaguely aware of Bartitsu and simply mis-remembered or misheard the term; it may even have been a typographical error or a concern about [[copyright]]. It should also be noted that a newspaper report on a Bartitsu demonstration in London, published in 1900, had likewise misspelled the name as baritsu.<ref name="Godfrey, 2009" />

This confusion of names persisted through much of the 20th century, with Holmes enthusiasts puzzling over the identity of baritsu.  In the 1980s Fromm and Soames suggested that it was intended to be "bartitsu"<ref>{{cite book|first=Alan|last=Fromm|coauthors=Nicolas Soames|title=Judo, the gentle way|publisher=Routledge|year=1982|isbn=0710090250|pages=7<U+2013>8}}</ref> and in the 1990s scholars including Y. Hirayama, J. Hall, Richard Bowen and James Webb were able to identify the martial art of Sherlock Holmes.<ref name="Bowen, 1997" >{{cite journal

}}</ref>

== Later life ==
E.W. Barton-Wright spent the remainder of his career working as a physical therapist specialising in innovative (and sometimes controversial) forms of heat, light, and radiation [[therapy]]. He continued  to use the name "Bartitsu" with reference to his various therapeutic businesses.<ref name="Wolf, 2005" /> In 1950, Barton-Wright was interviewed by [[Gunji Koizumi]] for an article appearing in the [[Budokwai]] newsletter, and later that year he was presented to the audience at a Budokwai gathering in London.  He died in 1951, at the age of 90, and was buried in what the late martial arts historian Richard Bowen described as being "a pauper's grave."<ref name="Noble, 1999" >{{cite journal

== Legacy ==
In many ways, E.W. Barton-Wright was a man ahead of his time.  He was among the first Europeans known to have studied the [[Japanese martial arts]], and was almost certainly the first to have taught them in Europe, the [[British Empire]] or the Americas.

Bartitsu was the first martial art to have deliberately combined Asian and European fighting styles towards addressing the problems of civilian/urban [[self-defense|self-defence]] in an "unarmed society".  In this, Barton-Wright anticipated [[Bruce Lee]]'s [[Jeet Kune Do]] approach by over seventy years. A similar philosophy of [[pragmaticism|pragmatic]] [[eclecticism]] was taken up by other early 20th century European self-defence specialists, including Percy Longhurst, William Garrud and Jean Joseph-Renaud, all of whom had studied with former Bartitsu Club instructors.<ref name="Wolf, 2005" /> 

[[Defendo|Bill Underwood]], [[William E. Fairbairn]] and others charged with developing [[close combat]] systems for use by [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] troops during the [[Second World War]] likewise devised practical, intercultural hand-to-hand combat systems.  Underwood had actually studied jujutsu with Yukio Tani and another jujutsuka, [[Taro Miyake]], in London during the first decade of the 20th century. The systems founded by Underwood, Fairbairn, and their contemporaries became the basis for most [[military]] and [[police]] close-combat training throughout the Western world during the 20th century.

E.W. Barton-Wright is also remembered as a pioneering promoter of [[mixed martial arts]] or MMA contests, in which experts in different fighting styles compete under common rules.  Barton-Wright's champions, including Yukio Tani, Sadakazu Uyenishi and Swiss ''[[schwingen]]'' wrestler Armand Cherpillod enjoyed considerable success in these contests, which anticipated the MMA phenomenon of the 1990s by a hundred years.

The Bartitsu Club was among the first schools of its type in Europe to offer specialised classes in women's self defence, a practice taken up after the Club's demise by students of Yukio Tani and Sadakazu Uyenishi including [[Edith Margaret Garrud]] and Emily Watts.  Mrs. Garrud established her own jujutsu [[dojo]] (school) in London and also taught the art to members of the militant [[Suffragette]] movement, establishing an early association between self defence training and the political philosophy of [[feminism]].

== Contemporary interest and revival==
In 2001, the ''Electronic Journals of Martial Arts and Sciences'' (EJMAS) web site<ref name="EJMAS" >[http://ejmas.com Electronic Journals of Martial Arts and Sciences]</ref> began to re-publish many of Barton-Wright's magazine articles that had been discovered in the [[British Library]] archives by Richard Bowen.<ref name="Bowen" >{{cite web
  |url=http://www.bath.ac.uk/library/archives/bowen.htm 
  |publisher=University of Bath Archives
  |title=Richard Bowen Collection
}}</ref>  Almost immediately, the "Self Defence with a Walking Stick" articles attracted a minor [[cult]] following and the illustrations were reproduced, often with humorous captions or other alterations, on a number of other sites.

In 2002, an international association of Bartitsu enthusiasts, known as the Bartitsu Society, was formed to research and then revive E.W. Barton-Wright's "New Art of Self Defence". The Bartitsu Society divides Bartitsu research into two related fields, those of [[canonical]] Bartitsu (the self-defense sequences that were detailed by Barton-Wright and his assistants between 1899<U+2013>1902) and neo-Bartitsu (modern, individualised interpretations drawing especially from the training manuals produced by former Bartitsu Club instructors and their students between 1899 and the early 1920s).  Associated interests include social phenomena such as street [[gangsterism]] at the turn of the Twentieth century, the martial training of the militant Suffragette movement, and the study of the martial arts as [[Victorian era|Victorian]] and [[Edwardian]] [[social history]]. The Bartitsu Society communicates via an email group established by author [[Will Thomas]] and individual members offer practical seminars and training courses in Bartitsu fighting techniques.

In August 2005, the Society published a book, ''The Bartitsu Compendium'', which was edited by Tony Wolf.<ref name="Wolf, 2005" /> The ''Compendium'' details the complete history of the art as well as a technical curriculum for canonical Bartitsu. The second volume<ref name="Wolf, 2008" >{{cite book
  |editor=Wolf, Tony
  |title=The Bartitsu Compendium II
  |publisher=Lulu Publications
  |year=2008
  |ref=Wolf, 2008
}}</ref> was published in August 2008, comprising resources for neo-Bartitsu drawn both from Barton-Wright's own writings and from the corpus of self defence manuals produced by his colleagues and their students, including Yukio Tani, William Garrud, H.G. Lang and Jean Joseph Renaud.  

Articles on various aspects of Bartitsu have been published in journals including "Classical Fighting Arts", "Western Martial Arts Illustrated", "The Journal of Asian Martial Arts", "SteamPunk Magazine", "[[The Chap]]", "[[History Today]]" and "[[Clarkesworld Magazine]]".
 
In September 2006, Bartitsu Society member Kirk Lawson released a [[DVD]] entitled ''Bartitsu - the Martial Art of Sherlock Holmes'', which is a presentation of Bartitsu techniques as demonstrated at the Spring '06 Cumann Bhata [[Western Martial Arts]] Seminar. 

In October 2006, the Bartitsu Society launched the Bartitsu.org website,<ref name="Bartitsu.org" >{{cite web
  |url=http://www.bartitsu.org/ 
  |title=Bartitsu.org
}}</ref> which includes information on the history, theory and practice of Barton-Wright's martial art.

In July 2008, Kirk Lawson officially announced the first ongoing Bartitsu/Neo-Bartitsu training commitment at his club, Cumann Bhata Dayton. In August 2009 the Bartitsu Society announced the production of a full-length documentary on E.W. Barton-Wright and his self defence arts.

Proceeds from the sales of the ''Bartitsu Compendium'', the ''Bartitsu Compendium II'', and the ''Martial Art of Sherlock Holmes'' DVD have been dedicated to creating a memorial for E.W. Barton-Wright.

=="Baritsu" in popular culture==

Conan Doyle's "baritsu" developed a life of its own during the latter 20th century, and it was duly recorded that fictional heroes including [[Doc Savage]] and [[The Shadow]] had been initiated into its mysteries; the latter two characters were established as knowing baritsu in a [[DC Comics]] crossover that spilled over into The Shadow Strikes. Baritsu was also incorporated into the rules of several [[role-playing games]] set during the Victorian and Edwardian eras.<ref name="GURPS, 2007" >{{cite book

The [[manga]] and [[anime]] series Kuroshitsuji ([[Black Butler]]) features a character named Tanaka who is proficient in baritsu.

Richard Ryan, the fight choreographer for the 2009 movie ''[[Sherlock Holmes (2009 film)|Sherlock Holmes]]'', has described the "neo-Bartitsu" developed for that project as being a combination of "Chinese Boxing ([[Wing Chun]]), swordplay and elements of [[Brazilian Jujitsu]]." This "movie Bartitsu" was said to be an modern interpretation of the classic Victorian Bartitsu Style. <ref>Wolf, Tony and Ryan, Richard (2009): [http://www.bartitsu.org/index.php/2009/12/its-brilliant-perfect-lets-change-it-an-interview-with-sherlock-holmes-fight-choreographer-richard-ryan/ "It's brilliant, perfect ... let's change it!
