'''''A Cotton Office in New Orleans''''' is an 1873 oil painting by [[Edgar Degas]]. In it, Degas depicts the moment when his uncle Michel Musson's [[cotton]] brokerage business went [[bankrupt]] in an economic crash, according to Michael McMahon of the ''[[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]].'' The firm was swamped by the postwar growth of the much larger [[New Orleans Cotton Exchange|Cotton Exchange]]. In the painting, Musson is seen examining raw cotton for its quality while Degas' brother Rene reads ''[[The Daily Picayune]].'' It carried the bankruptcy news. Another brother, Achille, rests against a window wall at left while others, including Musson's partners, go about their business.<ref>Excellent Exhibitions Detail Mark of French Influence, ''Pittsburgh Post-Gazette,'' July 3, 1999</ref>

''A Cotton Office in New Orleans'' was the first painting by Degas to be purchased by a museum, and the first by an [[Impressionism|Impressionist]].<ref>[http://www.worldcat.org/title/degas-and-the-business-of-art-a-cotton-office-in-new-orleans/oclc/26850761/ ''Degas and the Business of Art: A Cotton Office in New Orleans,'' Marilyn Brown, Pennsylvania State University Press, 1994]</ref> Degas' sale of the piece marked a turning point in his career as he moved from being a struggling, unrecognized artist to a recognized and financially stable artist, according to Marilyn Brown in her book ''Degas and the Business of Art: A Cotton Office in New Orleans.''<ref name="books.google.com">[http://books.google.com/books?id=vWTZpFv4m9QC&printsec=frontcover&dq=%22a+cotton+office+in+new+orleans%22&source=bl&ots=WgzZSi6sI-&sig=28y2PJIBFI6VSA1faEc5nIefLuM&hl=en&ei=ja-7TMmuHcGclgegqLGaDQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=3&ved=0CBkQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&q&f=false/ ''Degas and the Business of Art: A Cotton Office in New Orleans,'' Marilyn Brown, Pennsylvania State University Press, 1994].</ref>

Degas traveled from [[Europe]] to [[New Orleans]] in late 1872 with his brother, Ren<U+00E9>, to visit his mother's brother, Michael Musson.<ref name="books.google.com"/> After the [[American Civil War]], Ren<U+00E9> had joined his uncle's cotton factor firm in New Orleans.<ref name="books.google.com"/> Degas was to return to Europe in January 1873, but when his return trip was delayed, he decided to paint the cotton business surrounding him.<ref name="books.google.com"/>

Degas crafted his work with the intent of selling it to a [[United Kingdom|British]] [[textile]] manufacturer. But a drop in stock prices worldwide and declines in the cotton and art markets ended his hopes for that specific sale.<ref name="worldcat.org">[http://www.worldcat.org/title/degas-and-the-business-of-art-a-cotton-office-in-new-orleans/oclc/26850761/ ''Degas and the Business of Art: A Cotton Office in New Orleans,'' Marilyn Brown, Pennsylvania State University Press, 1994].</ref> Degas then exhibited ''A Cotton Office in New Orleans'' in the second Impressionist show in [[Paris, France|Paris]] in 1876. Degas finally sold the painting in 1878 to the newly founded [[Mus<U+00E9>e des Beaux-Arts de Pau|Musee des Beaux-Arts]] in [[Pau, Pyr<U+00E9>n<U+00E9>es-Atlantiques|Pau, France]].<ref name="worldcat.org"/>

The painting is sometimes mistakenly referred to as ''The Cotton Exchange at New Orleans,'' referring to the historic [[New Orleans Cotton Exchange]].<ref>[http://www.jstor.org/pss/4233216/ Louisiana History: The Journal of the Louisiana Historical Association, 1995].</ref>
