'''Auber Octavius Neville''' ([[October 20]], [[1875]]&ndash;[[April 18]], [[1954]]) was a [[Bureaucracy|bureaucrat]] in [[Western Australia]].

Born in [[Northumberland]], [[England]], Neville immigrated to [[Australia]] as a child. In [[1897]] he went from [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] to [[Western Australia]] and joined the [[civil service]] there, where he quickly rose through the ranks.

In [[1915]] Neville was appointed the second ''[[Protector of Aborigines|Chief Protector of Aborigines]]''. During the next quarter-century, he presided over the now notorious '[[Stolen Generation]]' policy of removing mixed-race [[Australian Aborigine|Aboriginal]] children from their parents. In [[1936]] Neville became the ''Commissioner for Native Affairs'', a post he held until his retirement in [[1940]].

Neville believed that biological absorption was the key to 'uplifting the Native race.' Speaking before the Royal Commission, which investigated the administration of Aboriginals in 1934, he defended the policies of forced settlement, removing children from parents, surveillance, discipline and punishment, arguing that "they have to be protected against themselves whether they like it or not. They cannot remain as they are. The sore spot requires the application of the surgeon's knife for the good of the patient, and probably against the patients will."

In his twilight years Neville continued to actively promote his policy. Towards the end of his career, Neville published ''Australia's Coloured Minority'', a text outlining his plan for the biological absorption of aboriginal people into white Australia. It is a classic example of the [[eugenics]] policies popular at the time in the Western world.

He was a notable resident of [[Darlington, Western Australia|Darlington]] and was a regular user of the [[Eastern Railway (Western Australia)|passenger railway service]] which closed a few months before his death.
He died in [[Perth, Western Australia|Perth]], and was buried in [[Karrakatta Cemetery]].

He was portrayed as the public face of the policy in the [[2002]] film ''[[Rabbit-Proof Fence (movie)|Rabbit Proof Fence]]'', (played by [[Kenneth Branagh]]) and [[Jack Davis (playwright)|Jack Davis]]' [[1985]] play ''[[No Sugar (play)|No Sugar]]''.
