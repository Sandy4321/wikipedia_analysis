The '''CU Project Controversy''' involved years of protest against a proposed [[high-voltage direct current]] [[Electric power transmission|powerline]] that was erected on the property of hundreds of farmers in west central [[Minnesota]] in the late 1970s. Opposition to the powerline began in 1974 and involved political parties, churches, civic organizations, and businesses in several different Minnesota counties.<ref name=oralhistory>{{cite journal |last1=Fogerty |first1=James E. |year=1985 |title=Oral History and Environmental Controversy: The Minnesota Powerline Project |journal=The Oral History Review |volume=13 |pages=81}}</ref><ref name="wellstone13">{{cite book |last=Wellstone |first=Paul |coauthors=Barry M.

==Background==
===The growth of electrical co-ops===
The CU Powerline Project was initiated by [[Great River Energy|Cooperative Power Association]] (CPA) of [[Edina, Minnesota]] and [[Great River Energy|United Power Association]] (UPA) of [[Elk River (Minnesota)|Elk River, Minnesota]]. CPA and UPA were Minnesota electrical generation and transmission associations comprised of a combined total of 34 retail [[Utility cooperative|electrical co-ops]].

Retail electrical co-ops formed in order to be eligible for the REA's distribution loans.<ref name=change /> Co-ops often combined in federations to purchase power from private utilities or federal agencies. Occasionally these co-op associations built their own [[Power station|generating stations]].<ref name=Minn>{{cite book |last=Wellstone |first=Paul |coauthors=Barry M. Casper |title=[[Powerline: The First Battle of America<U+2019>s Energy War]] |publisher=University of Minnesota Press |year=1981 |isbn=0-8166-4384-9 |page=10}}</ref>

===Motivation behind the CU Project===
Several factors led UPA and CPA to undertake the CU Project. UPA and CPA traditionally purchased most of their power from the [[United States Bureau of Reclamation|Bureau of Reclamation's]] [[Garrison Dam]] on the Missouri River in North Dakota.<ref name=oralhistory86>{{cite journal |last1=Fogerty |first1=James E. |year=1985 |title=Oral History and Environmental Controversy: The Minnesota Powerline Project |journal=The Oral History Review |volume=13 |pages=86}}</ref> UPA and CPA wanted to curtail their purchase of power to avoid the long term contract commitments. They desired to increase their "control over their energy supplies and costs".<ref name=oralhistory86 /> UPA and CPA predicted that they would not be able to meet the demand of retail co-op members for their electricity. As a result of the [[1973 oil crisis|oil crisis]] of the 1970s, oil prices more than doubled from 1973 to 1978. UPA and CPA believed that consumers would switch to electricity as a source of power to avoid high oil prices.<ref name=secondguess>{{cite news |title=State Powerline Still Generating Concerns and Second-guesses |author= |first=Pat |last=Doyle |authorlink= |author2= |author3= |author4= |author5= |author6= |author7= |url= |format= |agency= |newspaper=Minneapolis Star Tribune |publisher= |location= |isbn= |issn= |oclc= |pmid= |pmd= |bibcode= |doi= |id= |date=November 13, 1988 |page=01A |pages= |accessdate= |language= |trans_title= |quote= |archiveurl= |archivedate= |ref= }}</ref> Demand for the electricity provided by UPA and CPA was already growing and UPA and CPA predicted that this growth would continue at the same rate.<ref>{{cite book |last=Wellstone |first=Paul |coauthors=Barry M.

===The CU Project and the REA===
In 1972, UPA and CPA approached REA about the possibility of building a new generating station.<ref name="wellstone13"/> The REA favored a lignite coal generator in North Dakota over a Minnesota plant using [[Montana]] coal shipped by train.<ref name=wellstone13 /> The REA had financed other [[lignite]] coal generators in North Dakota, three of which were among the ten most economical plants in the country in the early 1970s.<ref name=wellstone13 />
The REA agreed to finance the construction through low-interest loans.<ref name=wellstone3>{{cite book |last=Wellstone |first=Paul |coauthors=Barry M.

==The CU Project==
===Components===
The CU Project consists of three parts: the Falkirk Mine, the Coal Creek Generating Station, and the [[CU (Powerline)|CU Powerline]].<ref name=wellstone15>{{cite book |last=Wellstone |first=Paul |coauthors=Barry M. Casper |title=[[Powerline: The First Battle of America<U+2019>s Energy War]] |publisher=University of Minnesota Press |year=1981 |isbn=0-8166-4384-9 |page=15}}</ref> A subsidiary of [[North American Coal Corporation]] runs the Falkirk Mine, a lignite coal strip mine in North Dakota that covers over twenty-five square miles and uses two of the biggest [[dragline excavator]]s  ever assembled.<ref name=wellstone15 /> The lignite uncovered by the draglines travels by conveyor belt to [[Coal Creek Station]], the largest lignite-fired plant in North Dakota.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coal_Creek_Station |title=Coal Creek Station |first= |last= |author= |authorlink= |coauthors= |date= |work= |publisher= |location= |page= |pages= |language= |trans_title= |format= |doi= |archiveurl= |archivedate= |accessdate=November 23, 2009 |quote= |ref= |separator= |postscript= }}</ref><ref name=wellstone15 /> The Coal Creek Station produces AC current which is converted into DC current at a conversion station.<ref name=wellstone15 /> This DC current is transmitted from Coal Creek Station in North Dakota  430 miles to a station near [[Delano, Minnesota]] where it is converted back into AC current. The powerline crosses 9 western and central Minnesota counties and includes a total of 659 towers placed at one-quarter mile intervals on the property of 476 landowners: primarily corn, wheat, soybean, and sugar beet farms.<ref name=fogerty80>{{cite journal |last1=Fogerty |first1=James E. |year=1985 |title=Oral History and Environmental Controversy: The Minnesota Powerline Project |journal=The Oral History Review |volume=13 |pages=80}}</ref>

===Arguments against the CU Project===
The first opponents to the CU Project were farmers who found out that the powerline would be built on their land. Farmers were upset with the way that the powerline route was initially conceived. In 1973 UPA and CPA hired a consulting firm which used a numbering system to assess the value of the land between North Dakota and Minnesota. They assigned high numbers (more value) to airports, highways, and wildlife areas but zero to agricultural land.<ref name=wellstone17>{{cite book |last=Wellstone |first=Paul |coauthors=Barry M.

Farmers used a variety of tactics to thwart surveying on their property. They raised signs on poles to block the view of the surveyors.<ref name=wellstone>{{cite book |last=Wellstone |first=Paul |coauthors=Barry M. Casper |title=[[Powerline: The First Battle of America<U+2019>s Energy War]] |publisher=University of Minnesota Press |year=1981 |isbn=0-8166-4384-9 |page=142}}</ref> When a protester was hauled away for blocking the surveyor's line of sight, another protester would take the original protester's place.<ref name=wellstone146>{{cite book |last=Wellstone |first=Paul |coauthors=Barry M.

On one instance, farmers were granted permission by their town board to repair a road leading to a survey site. When survey crews arrived, farmers had put up roadblocks and were in the process of digging a hole in the road.<ref name=wellstone145 /> Farmers used their tractors to pile boulders around the tower base holes preventing concrete from being poured. One farmer parked his truck with the key broken off in the ignition to block cement mixers. Another farmer "drove upwind of a utility crew then switched on his manure spreader". Survey stakes would vanish overnight.<ref name=wellstone179>{{cite book |last=Wellstone |first=Paul |coauthors=Barry M.

===Mobilization of state troopers===
On January 4, 1978, a hundred farmers chased powerline crews from three different sites and "scuffled" with state troopers.<ref name=wellstone201>{{cite book |last=Wellstone |first=Paul |coauthors=Barry M.

===The "Battle of Stearns County"===
On February 15, 1978, farmers sprayed troopers with anhydrous ammonia, a fertilizer that can cause serious chemical burns.<ref name=Minnesota1 /><ref name=wellstone216>{{cite book |last=Wellstone |first=Paul |coauthors=Barry M.

==="March for Justice"===
On March 5, 1978 over eight thousand people marched from [[Lowry, Minnesota|Lowry]] to [[Glenwood, Minnesota|Glenwood]] in below freezing temperatures to protest the CU Project. Marchers followed a tractor draped with an American flag that carried a coffin labeled "Justice" and a figure labeled "Corporate Giant".<ref name="wellstone220"/>

==="Bolt Weevils"===
Beginning in August 1978, a group that called themselves the "Bolt Weevils" began to sabotage power line towers and shoot out electrical insulators.<ref name="wellstone273"/><ref name=wellstone277>{{cite book |last=Wellstone |first=Paul |coauthors=Barry M. Casper |title=[[Powerline: The First Battle of America<U+2019>s Energy War]] |publisher=University of Minnesota Press |year=1981 |isbn=0-8166-4384-9 |page=277}}</ref> The General Assembly to Stop the Powerline (GASP) put out a regular newsletter called Hold That Line. One issue commented on the acts of the Bolt Weevils: "It is a mistake  to label these as acts of vandalism. Vandalism means 'ignorant destruction of property,' and it would be a big misunderstanding to think that these acts are creatures of ignorance".<ref name=wellstone275>{{cite book |last=Wellstone |first=Paul |coauthors=Barry M. Casper |title=[[Powerline: The First Battle of America<U+2019>s Energy War]] |publisher=University of Minnesota Press |year=1981 |isbn=0-8166-4384-9 |page=275}}</ref> The electrical co-ops hired outside security officers that used helicopters and vehicles to patrol the line.<ref name=wellstone278>{{cite book |last=Wellstone |first=Paul |coauthors=Barry M. Casper |title=[[Powerline: The First Battle of America<U+2019>s Energy War]] |publisher=University of Minnesota Press |year=1981 |isbn=0-8166-4384-9 |page=278}}</ref> UPA and CPA launched a public relations campaign to communicate to customers that vandalism would lead to electric bill increases.<ref name=wellstone281>{{cite book |last=Wellstone |first=Paul |coauthors=Barry M. Casper |title=[[Powerline: The First Battle of America<U+2019>s Energy War]] |publisher=University of Minnesota Press |year=1981 |isbn=0-8166-4384-9 |page=281}}</ref> On August 1, 1979 the CU powerline went into commercial operation. On September 9, 1980, the REA took ownership of the line, in part so that attacks on the line would become federal offenses.<ref name="wellstone287"/> In the end, Bolt Weevils tore down 14 power line towers and shot out nearly 10,000 electrical insulators.<ref name=wellstonen />

==Consequences==
In the end, protesters were unsuccessful in blocking construction of the powerline. The fight had the unintended consequence of higher payments to farmers whose land was taken for the powerline.<ref name=health />
From 1976 to 1978, 120 people were arrested in connection with the protest. 4 people were convicted of criminal counts and 1 was convicted of felony charges.<ref name="wellstone286"/>

Soon after the powerline entered commercial operation, UPA and CPA saw a dropoff in demand for electricity. UPA and CPA ended up selling this surplus electricity to other utilities.<ref name=secondguess /> Eventually, consumer demand increased. Since 1980, consumer demand for electricity in Minnesota has doubled. In the late 2000s, [[Xcel Energy|Xcel Energy, Inc.]] and 10 other utility companies announced plans to build a new high-voltage transmission line.<ref name=charged>{{cite news |title=A Less-Charged Debate |author= |first=Mike |last=Meyers |authorlink= |author2= |author3= |author4= |author5= |author6= |author7= |url= |format= |agency= |newspaper=Minneapolis Star Tribune |publisher= |location= |isbn= |issn= |oclc= |pmid= |pmd= |bibcode= |doi= |id= |date=January 14, 2007 |page=1D |pages= |accessdate= |language= |trans_title= |quote= |archiveurl= |archivedate= |ref= }}</ref>

A report detailing health concerns about the CU powerline was cited by a judge as a reason to block powerline construction in Texas.<ref name=secondguess />

In the mid-2000s, a new group calling itself the "Bolt Weevils" emerged in Minnesota. The group vandalized [[Syngenta|Novartis]]/Northrup-King<U+2019>s Seed research facility and trampled 50 rows of research corn adjacent to [[Pioneer Hi-Bred]]<U+2019>s seed research facility.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.foodsafety.ksu.edu/en/news-details.php?a=3&c=29&sc=220&id=38543 |title=BOLT WEEVILS COMMUNIQUE |first= |last= |author=International Food Safety Network |authorlink= |coauthors= |date=January 1, 2005 |work= |publisher= |location= |page= |pages= |language= |trans_title= |format= |doi= |archiveurl= |archivedate= |accessdate=November 24, 2009 |quote= |ref= |separator= |postscript= }}</ref>
