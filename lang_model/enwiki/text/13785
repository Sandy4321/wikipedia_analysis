'''Apsley Falls''' is a series of [[waterfall]]s in the [[New England (Australia)|New England]] region of [[New South Wales]], [[Australia]].  The falls are located about {{convert|20|km|mi|0|lk=on}} east of [[Walcha]], and {{convert|1|km|mi|0|lk=off}} off the [[Oxley Highway]] in the [[Oxley Wild Rivers National Park]]. They are the first falls in a succession of dramatic drops in an area that has some of the most remarkable scenery in Eastern Australia.{{cn}}  The first drop of the Falls is {{convert|114|m|ft|0|lk=on}} in depth, and the second, which is about {{convert|800|m|ft|0|lk=off}} further on, plummets {{convert|195|m|ft|0|lk=off}} metres to the bottom of the gorge. 

==History==
Apart from [[Indigenous Australians|Aboriginal]] significance of the area as a meeting place, [[John Oxley]] passed by the falls in 1818 and they were then named Beckett's Falls. 

Oxley named the [[Apsley River]] and wrote in his journal that he was "lost in astonishment at the sight of this wonderful natural sublimity". 

In 1902 three men, Ted Baker, Jim McMillan and "Wattie" Joiner built the wooden stairway that zig-zagged its way from the top of the gorge to the water's edge. All timber used in this dangerous and mammoth task was hand dressed with axe and [[adze]] by this trio.

Quite sometime after this stairway rotted and became dangerous the Walcha [[Lions Clubs International|Lions Club]] set about the huge task of erecting a steel staircase and viewing platform to half way down the gorge. One of the Lions, Lindsay McMillan, designed the steel structure, lookout and platform. All materials were supplied by the [[Walcha Shire]] and it took the Lions Club members 1,745 hours to complete the job during 1964. The Lions were internationally, and justly, recognised for their tremendous contribution here.

==Features== 
Since the [[National Parks and Wildlife Service (New South Wales)|National Parks and Wildlife Service]] took over they have constructed additional lookouts and walkways to view and photograph this magnificent gorge and the two falls. [[Wedge-tailed Eagle]]s may be seen soaring on the [[thermal]]s in the area. 

There are several short walks that can be taken from the car parks and these are highlighted in the information shelter erected in the area along with toilet 

==Facilities==
A sealed walkway crosses the Apsley River, passes around the gorge rim, to spectacular viewing platforms and lets you discover the lower falls and  cliff faces. 

Interpretation displays, picnic tables, free gas barbeques, water, toilets and camping grounds with amenities for caravan or tent campers. Dogs and other domestic pets are not allowed.
