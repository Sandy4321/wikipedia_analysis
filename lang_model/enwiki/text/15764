*''This article is about the role of [[Christian Zionism]] in the [[United Kingdom]] in the 21st century.''
*''For the history of Christian Zionism in the United Kingdom predating the 21st century see [[Christian Zionism]] and [[Dispensationalism]]''

The role of '''Christian Zionism in the United Kingdom''' in the 21st century, as opposed to the history of the beginning of the movement in Britain under [[Christian Zionism]] and [[Dispensationalism]], is little known outside of the movement itself. It is a subsection of the [[Christian_right#United_Kingdom|Christian right in Britain]].

In contrast to Britain, the subject in [[America]] is well known and extensively commented on in the print and telivised media.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/1969542.stm Analysis: America's new Christian Zionists], [[BBC News]], May 7 2002</ref><ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/5193092.stm Evangelical Christians plead for Israel], [[BBC News]], July 19 2006</ref>

It is an established fact that Christian Zionism has its roots in Britain and that is has played an extremely significant role in that countries politics in the past.

It is also an established fact that [[Israel lobby in the_United Kingdom|within the politics of the UK today the Israel Lobby is extremely influential]], as is the case in the US, but admittedly in Britain to a smaller yet still substantively significant degree.

This article will seek to address to what extent does Christian Zionism play a role in British politics today. How entangled is the Israel Lobby in the UK, inside and out of government, with fundamentalist Christian Zionism. To what degree are Britain<U+2019>s politicians, especially those involved with Middle Eastern foreign policy, entwined with this ideology. On that note, to what degree are Christian Zionist lobbyists towards the government operating. And, is it of such a relationship, with the politicians, the lobby and this ideology, that it is helping to drive British foreign policy in the Middle East towards the brink of a destruction in order to fulfil biblical prophesy.

Prominent Christian Zionist organisations in Britain are [https://www.cfi.org.uk/index.php Christian Friends of Israel, UK], the [http://www.cmj.org.uk/ Church's Ministry Among Jewish People] (The Israel Trust of the Anglican Church), Intercessors For Britain (IFB), "Prayer Friends of Israel" (PFI), [http://www.ccj.org.uk/ Council of Christians and Jews], [http://www.dpmuk.org/ Derek Prince Ministries] and the [[Beit Yeshua]], [http://www.vision.pwp.blueyonder.co.uk/beityeshua/index.html North East Messianic Fellowship].

The Rev. Dr. [[Stephen Sizer]] states that ''"Contemporary British Christian leaders such as Derek Prince, David Pawson, Lance Lambert, Walter Riggans, along with Americans like Jerry Falwell, Pat Robertson, Hal Lindsey, Mike Evans, Charles Dyer and John Walvoord, have a considerable influence in popularising an apocalyptic premillennial eschatology and Zionist vision on the British Evangelical scene in particular."''
