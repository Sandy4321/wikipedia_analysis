'''PNC Park''' is a [[baseball park]] located on the [[North Shore (Pittsburgh)|North Shore]] of [[Pittsburgh]], [[Pennsylvania]]. It is the fifth home of the [[Pittsburgh Pirates]], the city's [[Major League Baseball]] (MLB) franchise.<ref name="official"/><ref name="ESPN"/> It opened during the [[2001 Major League Baseball season|2001 MLB season]], after the [[building implosion|controlled implosion]] of the Pirates' previous home, [[Three Rivers Stadium]]. The ballpark is sponsored by [[PNC Financial Services]], which purchased the [[naming rights]] in 1998.<ref name=PNCfs>{{cite journal |first=Lauren|last=Jaeger|title=PNC Bank Purchases Naming Rights To Pittsburgh Pirates' New Stadium||journal=Amusement Business|date=August 17, 1998|volume=110|issue=33|page=10}}</ref> PNC Park features a natural grass playing surface and seats 38,362 people for baseball.

Funded in conjunction with [[Heinz Field]] and the [[David L. Lawrence Convention Center]], the $216&nbsp;million park stands along the [[Allegheny River]], on the [[North Shore (Pittsburgh)|North Shore]] of Pittsburgh with a view of [[Downtown Pittsburgh]]. Plans to build a new stadium for the Pirates originated in 1991, but did not come to fruition for five years. Built in the style of "classic" stadiums, such as Pittsburgh's [[Forbes Field]], PNC Park also introduced unique features, such as the use of [[limestone]] in the building's facade.<ref name="official"/> The park also features a riverside concourse, steel truss work, an extensive out-of-town scoreboard, and many local eateries. Constructed faster than most modern stadiums, PNC Park was built in a 24-month span.

==History==
===Planning and funding===
On September 5, 1991, [[Pittsburgh]] mayor [[Sophie Masloff]] proposed a new 44,000-seat stadium for the [[Pittsburgh Pirates]] on the city's Northside.<ref name=OnDeck/> [[Three Rivers Stadium]], the Pirates' home at the time, had been designed for functionality rather than "architecture and aesthetics".<ref name=OnDeck/> The location of Three Rivers Stadium came to be criticized for being in a hard-to-access portion of the city, where traffic congestion occurred before and after games.<ref>{{cite book|last=Smith|first=Curt|authorlink=Curt Smith (author)|title=Storied Stadiums|year=2001|publisher=Carroll & Graf|location=New York City|isbn=0-7867-1187-6}}</ref> Discussions about a new ballpark took place, but were never seriously considered until entrepreneur [[Kevin McClatchy]] purchased the team in February 1996. Until McClatchy's purchase, plans about the team remaining in Pittsburgh were uncertain.<ref name=OnDeck>{{cite journal |last=Bouma|first=Ben|year=1998|title=Heading for Home|journal=On Deck: the Official Magazine of the Pittsburgh Pirates|volume=3|issue=3|pages=42<U+2013>8}}</ref> In 1996, Masloff's successor, [[Tom Murphy (mayor)|Tom Murphy]], created the "Forbes Field II Task Force". Made up of 29&nbsp;political and business leaders, the team studied the challenges of constructing a new ballpark. Their final report, published on June 26, 1996, evaluated 13&nbsp;possible locations. The "North Side site" was recommended due to its affordable cost, potential to develop the surrounding area, and opportunity to incorporate the city skyline into the stadium's design.<ref name=OnDeck/> The site selected for the ballpark is just upriver from the site of early Pirates home field [[Exposition Park (Pittsburgh)|Exposition Park]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.pittsburghcitypaper.ws/gyrobase/Content?oid=oid%3A47798|title=Was There A Baseball Field That the Pittsburgh Pirates Played in Before Forbes Field in Oakland?|accessdate=July 30, 2008|first=Chris|last=Potter|date=June 12, 2008|work=You Had To Ask|newspaper=[[Pittsburgh City Paper]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/06192/700663-341.stm|title=Exposition Park|accessdate=July 30, 2008|date=July 11, 2006|newspaper=[[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]]}}</ref>

After a political debate, public money was used to fund PNC Park. Originally, a [[sales tax]] increase was proposed to fund three projects: PNC Park, [[Heinz Field]], and an expansion of the [[David L. Lawrence Convention Center]]. However, after the proposal was soundly rejected in a [[referendum]], the city developed ''Plan&nbsp;B''.<ref>{{cite news |title=Plan B|newspaper=[[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]]|url=http://www.post-gazette.com/planb/|accessdate=April 5, 2008}}</ref> Similarly controversial, the alternative proposal was labeled ''Scam&nbsp;B'' by opponents.<ref name="TD">{{cite news |last=Dvorchak|first=Robert|title=A TD for Plan B|newspaper=[[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]]|date=June 21, 1998|url=http://www.post-gazette.com/regionstate/19980621bplanb5.asp|accessdate=April 5, 2008}}</ref> Some members of the [[Allegheny Regional Asset District]] felt that the Pirates' pledge of $40&nbsp;million toward the new stadium was too little, while others criticized the amount of public money allocated for Plan B.
