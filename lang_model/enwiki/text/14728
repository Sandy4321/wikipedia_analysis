'''Tau Ceti''' (<U+03C4> Cet / <U+03C4> Ceti, {{pronEng|<U+02CC>ta<U+028A> <U+02C8>si<U+02D0>ta<U+026A>}}) is a [[star]] in the [[constellation]] [[Cetus]] that is similar to the [[Sun]] in [[mass]] and [[Stellar classification|spectral type]]. At just under 12 [[light years]]' distance from the [[Solar System]], it is a relatively close star. Tau Ceti is "[[metallicity|metal-deficient]]" and so it is thought to be less likely to host [[terrestrial planets|rocky planets]]. Observations have detected more than 10 times as much dust surrounding Tau Ceti as is present in the Solar System. The star appears stable, with little [[stellar variation]]. 
 
No companions have yet been detected around Tau Ceti through astrometric or radial velocity measurements; given current search refinement, this only excludes substellar companions such as large [[brown dwarf]]s. Because of the [[debris disk]] any planet orbiting Tau Ceti would face far more [[impact event]]s than the Earth. Despite this hurdle to [[Planetary habitability|habitability]], "[[solar analog]]" (Sun-like) characteristics have led to widespread interest in the star. It has been consistently listed as a target for [[SETI|Search for Extra-Terrestrial Intelligence]] (SETI) searches, given its stability and similarity to the Sun.

Tau Ceti does not have a widely recognized traditional name, as do many other prominent stars.{{Ref_label|A|a|none}}  It can be seen with the unaided eye as a faint third-[[Apparent magnitude|magnitude]] star. As seen from Tau Ceti, the Sun would be a third-magnitude star in the constellation [[Bo<U+00F6>tes]].{{Ref_label|B|b|none}} 

==Motion==
The [[proper motion]] of a star is its amount of movement across the [[celestial sphere]], determined by comparing its position relative to more distant background objects. Tau Ceti is considered to be a high-proper-motion star, although it only has an annual traverse of just under two [[arc second]]s.{{Ref_label|C|c|none}}  It will require several thousand years before the location of this star shifts by more than a degree. A high proper motion is an indicator of close proximity to the Sun.<ref>{{cite web

The [[radial velocity]] of a star is its motion toward or away from the Sun. Unlike proper motion, a star's radial velocity can not be directly observed, but must be determined through measurement of the spectrum. Due to the [[Doppler effect|Doppler shift]], the [[absorption line]]s in the spectrum of a star will be shifted slightly toward the red (or longer wavelengths) if the star is moving away from the observer, or toward blue (or shorter wavelengths) when it moves toward the observer. In the case of Tau Ceti, the radial velocity is about <U+2212>17&nbsp;km/s, with the negative value indicating that it is moving toward the Sun.<ref>{{cite journal

The distance to Tau Ceti, along with its proper motion and radial velocity, allow the motion of the star through space to be calculated. The [[space velocity]] relative to the Sun is about 37&nbsp;km/s.{{Ref_label|D|d|none}} This result can then be used to compute an orbital path of Tau Ceti through the [[Milky Way]] galaxy. It has a mean galacto-centric distance of 9.7 [[kiloparsec]]s (32,000 light-years) and an [[orbital eccentricity]] of 0.22.<ref name=Mello>{{cite journal

==Physical properties==
[[Image:Compare sun tau ceti.png|left|thumb|320px|The Sun (left) is both larger and somewhat hotter than the less active Tau Ceti (right).]]
The Tau Ceti system is believed to have only one stellar component. A dim optical companion has been observed, which is possibly gravitationally bound, but it is more than 10&nbsp;arcseconds distant from the primary.<ref name=Pijpers2003>{{cite journal |last=Pijpers |first=F.

Most of what is known about the physical properties of Tau Ceti has been determined through [[spectroscopy|spectroscopic]] measurements. By comparing the spectrum to computed models of stellar evolution, the age, mass, radius and luminosity of Tau Ceti can be estimated. However, using an [[astronomical interferometer]], fairly accurate measurements of the radius of the star can be made directly. It deploys a long baseline to measure angles much smaller than can be resolved with a conventional [[telescope]]. Through this means, the radius of Tau Ceti has been measured as 81.6 <U+00B1> 1.3% of the [[solar radius]]. This is about the size that is expected for a star with somewhat lower mass than the Sun.<ref name="aa426" /> Earlier interferometric measurements had suggested 77.3 <U+00B1> 0.4% of the solar radius but with less precision.<ref name=Pijpers2003/> 

===Rotation===

The [[rotation period]] for Tau Ceti was measured by periodic variations in the classic H and K absorption lines of singly-[[ion]]ized [[Calcium]], or Ca II. These lines are closely associated with surface [[magnetism|magnetic]] activity,<ref>{{cite web
  | url = http://www.mtwilson.edu/hk/Overview/
  | title = H-K Project: Overview of Chromospheric Activity
  | publisher = Mount Wilson Observatory
  | accessdate = 2006-11-15 }}</ref> so the period of variation measures the time required for the activity sites to complete a full rotation about the star. By this means the rotation period for Tau Ceti is estimated to be 34 days.<ref name="ApJL457" /> Due to the Doppler effect, the rotation rate of a star affects the width of the absorption lines in the spectrum. (Light from the side of the star moving away from the observer will be shifted to a longer wavelength; light from the side moving towards the observer will be shifted toward a shorter wavelength.) So by analyzing the width of these lines, the rotational velocity of a star can be estimated. The projected rotation velocity for Tau Ceti is:

:<math>\begin{smallmatrix} v_{eq} \cdot \sin i\ \approx\ 1\ \text{km/s} \end{smallmatrix}</math>. 

where ''v<sub>eq</sub>'' is the velocity at the [[equator]] and ''i'' is the inclination angle of the rotation axis to the line of sight. For a typical G8 star, the rotation velocity is about 2.5&nbsp;km/s. The relatively low rotational velocity measurements may indicate that Tau Ceti is being viewed from nearly the direction of its pole.<ref name=Gray1994>{{cite journal

===Metallicity===

The chemical composition of a star provides important clues to its evolutionary history, including the age at which it formed. The [[interstellar medium]] of dust and gas from which stars form is primarily composed of [[hydrogen]] and [[helium]] with trace amounts of heavier elements. As nearby stars continually evolve and die, they seed the interstellar medium with an increasing portion of heavier elements. Thus younger stars will tend to have a higher portion of heavy elements in their atmospheres than do the older stars. These heavy elements are termed metals by astronomers and the portion of heavy elements is the [[metallicity]].<ref>{{cite journal
  | author=G. Carraro, Y. K. Ng, L. Portinari
  | title=Age Metallicity Relation and Star Formation History of the Galactic Disk
  | journal=Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society
  | year=1999 | volume=296 | issue=4 | pages=1045<U+2013>1056
  | url=http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1997astro.ph..7185C
  | accessdate=2007-08-14 }}</ref> The amount of metallicity in a star is given in terms of the ratio of [[iron]] (Fe), an easily observed heavy element, to hydrogen. A [[logarithm]] of the relative iron abundance is compared to the Sun. In the case of Tau Ceti, the atmospheric metallicity is roughly:

:<math>\begin{smallmatrix} \left [ \frac{Fe}{H} \right ] = -0.50 \end{smallmatrix}</math>

or about a third the solar abundance. Past measurements have varied from -0.13 to -0.60.<ref name="strobel" /><ref name="mnras286" /> 

This lower abundance of iron indicates that Tau Ceti is almost certainly older than Sol: its estimated age is about 10&nbsp;[[Gyr]] compared to 4.57&nbsp;Gyr for the Sun. Ten billion years represents a substantial portion of the age of the visible [[universe]]. However, computed age estimates for Tau Ceti can range from 4.4&ndash;12&nbsp;Gyr, depending on the model adopted.<ref name="aa426" />

Besides rotation, another factor that can widen the absorption features in the spectrum of a star is pressure-broadening. (See [[spectral line]].) The presence of nearby particles will affect the radiation emitted by an individual particle. So the line width is dependent on the surface pressure of the star, which in turn is determined by the temperature and surface gravity. This technique was used to determine the surface gravity of Tau Ceti. The log&nbsp;''g'', or [[logarithm]] of the star's surface gravity, is about 4.4&mdash;very close to the log&nbsp;''g''&nbsp;=&nbsp;4.44 for the Sun.<ref name="strobel" />

===Luminosity and variability===

The [[luminosity]] of Tau Ceti is equal to only 55% of the [[solar luminosity|Sun's]].<ref name=Mello /> A [[terrestrial planet]] would need to orbit this star at a distance of just under 0.7 [[astronomical unit]]s (or AU, the average distance from the Earth to the Sun) in order match the solar-illumination level of the Earth. This is slightly less than the average distance between [[Venus]] and the Sun.

The [[chromosphere]] of Tau Ceti<U+2014>the portion of a star's atmosphere just above the light-emitting [[photosphere]]<U+2014>currently displays little or no magnetic activity, indicating a stable star.<ref>{{cite journal

===Debris disk===
In 2004 a team of [[United Kingdom|UK]] [[astronomer]]s led by Jane Greaves discovered that Tau Ceti has more than 10 times the amount of [[comet]]ary and [[asteroid]]al material orbiting it than does our Sun. This was determined by measuring the disk of cold dust orbiting the star produced by collisions between such small bodies.<ref name="Greaves">{{cite journal

}}</ref> This result puts a damper on the possibility of complex life in the system, as any planets would suffer from large [[impact event]]s roughly ten times more frequently than Earth. Greaves noted at the time of her research: "it is likely that [any planets] will experience constant bombardment from asteroids of the kind believed to have wiped out the [[dinosaurs]]."<ref name=McKee2004>{{cite web |first=Maggie|last=McKee|url= http://media.newscientist.com/article.ns?id=dn6123 |title=Life unlikely in asteroid-ridden star system |accessdate=2007-09-25 |date= [[July 07]], [[2004]] |publisher= [[New Scientist]]}}</ref> It is possible that a large [[Jupiter]]-sized [[gas giant]] could deflect comets and asteroids.<ref name="Greaves"/>{{Ref_label|E|e|none}} 

The debris disk was discovered by measuring the amount of radiation emitted by the system in the [[far infrared astronomy|far infrared]] portion of the [[spectrum]]. The disk forms a symmetric feature that is centered on the star, and the outer radius averages 55 AU. The lack of infrared radiation from the warmer parts of the disk near Tau Ceti imply an inner cut-off at a radius of 10 AU. By comparison, the Solar System's [[Kuiper belt]] extends from 30 to 50 AU. To be maintained over a long period of time, this ring of dust must be constantly replenished through collisions by larger bodies.<ref name="Greaves" /> The bulk of the disk appears to be orbiting Tau Ceti at a distance of 35&ndash;50 AU, well outside the orbit of the [[habitable zone]]. At this distance, the dust belt may be analogous to the [[Kuiper belt]] that lies outside the orbit of [[Neptune]] in the solar system.<ref name="Greaves" />

Tau Ceti shows that stars need not lose large disks as they age and such a thick belt may not be uncommon among Sun-like stars.<ref name=Greaves2005>{{cite journal

==Life and planet searches==

A principal factor driving research interest in Tau Ceti is its Sun-like characteristics and their implications for possible planets and life. Hall and Lockwood report that "the terms 'solarlike star,' '[[solar analog]],' and 'solar twin' [are] progressively restrictive descriptions."<ref>{{cite journal | author=Hall, J. C.; Lockwood, G.

===SETI and HabCat===
[[Image:Terrestrial Planet Finder PIA04499.jpg|thumb|250px|Tau Ceti may be a search target for the [[Terrestrial Planet Finder]]]]

The most optimistic search project to date was [[Project Ozma]], which was intended to "search for [[extraterrestrial intelligence]]" ([[SETI]]) by examining selected stars for indications of artificial radio signals. It was run by the astronomer [[Frank Drake]], who selected Tau Ceti and [[Epsilon Eridani]] as the initial targets. Both are located near the solar system and are physically similar to the Sun. No artificial signals were found despite 200&nbsp;hours of observations.<ref>{{cite web

This lack of results has not dampened interest in observing the Tau Ceti system for biosignatures. In 2002, astronomers [[Margaret Turnbull]] and [[Jill Tarter]] developed the [[Catalog of Nearby Habitable Systems]] (HabCat) under the auspices of [[Project Phoenix]], another SETI endeavour. The list contained more than 17,000 theoretically habitable systems, approximately 10% of the original sample.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Turnbull |first= Margaret C. |authorlink=Margaret Turnbull |coauthors=Tarter, Jill |year=2003 |month=March |title=Target Selection for SETI.
