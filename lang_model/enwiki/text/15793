The book is structured in a chronological format, and discusses the evolution of free speech in the U.S. within the context of the actions of individuals and how they affected change. The author asserts that protests and actions by citizens helped to evolve the notions surrounding free speech in the U.S., prior to definitive statements on the matter from U.S. courts.

The book received a positive reception from book reviews. A review in ''Columbia Journalism Review'' called it a "rich and original study",<ref name="boylan" /> and ''The Journal of American History'' noted that it includes "fine analytic discussions".<ref name="zuckert" /> ''Perspectives on Political Science'' called the book "an extremely valuable contribution to the literature addressing the history of free speech in America."<ref name="weizer" /> Timothy C. Shiell of the [[University of Wisconsin<U+2013>Stout]] reviewed the book for ''The Historian'' and noted, "Michael Kent Curtis offers a major contribution to the scholarship of both that era and of free speech."<ref name="shiell" />

==Contents==
Structured in a chronological order,<ref name="shiell" /> ''Free Speech, "The People<U+2019>s Darling Privilege"'' discusses the development of free speech through various controversies which arose during the history of the United States.<ref name="window" /> These include the [[Quasi-War]] with [[France]], the [[Alien and Sedition Acts]] of 1798, conflict regarding speech related to [[abolitionism]] and criticism of [[slavery]], and speech related to criticism of the [[American Civil War]].<ref name="zuckert" /><ref name="window" /> Curtis discusses the efforts of abolitionists [[Elijah Lovejoy]] and [[Hinton Helper]].<ref name="shiell" /> 

The author details attempts by [[U.S. President]] [[Abraham Lincoln]] to curtail free speech during the American Civil War.<ref name="zuckert" /> He comments on how attitudes regarding free speech affected events in history related to this period of time, "[t]he weakness of the popular free-speech tradition (especially in the South) encouraged violence that did not end with the Civil War ... [but was] revived during Reconstruction to silence those who supported civil and political rights for blacks".<ref name="shiell" /> Curtis discusses conflict involving individuals related to these historical events, including editors, political activists, and politicians.<ref name="window" /> The author delves into those that advocated the ideas of free speech prior to recognition of the right in the U.S. court system.<ref name="window" />

Curtis argues that despite actions by the government itself, it is the actions of individuals through speech and protest that allow democracy to function appropriately.<ref name="weizer" /> The author states that, "again and again, people in power have treated speech that advocated lawful change through democratic process as an incitement to lawless action".<ref name="shiell" /> Curtis posits that free speech rights in the United States which at present are believed to be given through 20th century court rulings, were actually developed first in "the forum of public opinion".<ref name="boylan" /> He argues, "[t]he history of free speech shows the need for broadly protective free speech rules applied generally and equally".<ref name="shiell" />

He writes that during the 18th and 19th centuries in the United States, protest exhibited from both individuals and the press predated court judgments regarding the development of free speech.<ref name="boylan" /> The author notes, "as Madison had expected, constitutional guarantees of liberty do their work at popular levels as well as at the level of institutions such as the Supreme Court of the United States, state supreme courts, Congress, and state legislatures. Popular views limit and channel both legislation and private action, each of which can either constrain or empower speech".<ref name="weizer" /> Curtis provides an admonition in the book, that "[t]he similarity of current suppression theories to those of the past suggests caution. Historic attempts to use these ideas to suppress democratic discussion of positive social change should make us wary of attempts to resurrect them for benevolent purposes".<ref name="shiell" />

Writing in a review of the book for the ''Columbia Journalism Review'', James Boylan characterized Curtis' work as a "rich and original study".<ref name="boylan">{{cite journal|last =Boylan| first=James|title=Free Speech, "The People<U+2019>s Darling Privilege"|journal=Columbia Journalism Review|volume=40|issue=1|page=86 | date = June 2001 | id = {{issn|0010-194X}} }}</ref> Reviewing the book for ''The Journal of American History'', Michael P. Zuckert called it a "very fine book", and "gracefully written and engaging to read".<ref name="zuckert" /> He commented, "After Curtis's book, nobody should be able to say that the Bill of Rights was unlikely to be on the minds of the drafters of the Fourteenth Amendment."<ref name="zuckert" /> Zuckert noted, "Sprinkled into the stories are fine analytic discussions."<ref name="zuckert" /> 

Writing in ''Perspectives on Political Science'', Paul Weizer described the book as "an extremely valuable contribution to the literature addressing the history of free speech in America."<ref name="weizer">{{cite journal|last =Weizer| first=Paul|title=Free Speech, "The People<U+2019>s Darling Privilege"|journal=Perspectives on Political Science|volume=30|issue=4|pages=237<U+2013>238| date =Fall 2001 | issn=1045-7097 }}</ref> Weizer commented, "Although there are countless books on the theories behind the speech guarantee embedded in our Constitution, Curtis brings a fresh perspective. Most First Amendment books begin with Supreme Court decisions from the early 1900s; Curtis reminds us that modern ideas about the protection of expression originated much earlier."<ref name="weizer" /> As to the writing quality of the book itself, Weizer wrote, "The first hundred years of American history are rich with stories such as this. Curtis does an outstanding job of bringing them to life. He is to be commended for keeping editorial comments to a minimum and allowing the participants to make his points for him. The book is painstakingly documented to provide first-person accounts from sources such as newspapers and town meetings."<ref name="weizer" /> Weizer's review recommended the book for those focusing on research in the subject matter, noting, "For specialists on free speech issues, the book provides remarkable detail."<ref name="weizer" />

In a review of the book for ''The Historian'', Timothy C. Shiell of the [[University of Wisconsin<U+2013>Stout]] wrote, "In providing the first detailed history of free speech from the Sedition Act of 1798 to the Fourteenth Amendment of the 1860s, Michael Kent Curtis offers a major contribution to the scholarship of both that era and of free speech."<ref name="shiell">{{cite journal|last =Shiell| first=Timothy C.|title=Free Speech, "The People<U+2019>s Darling Privilege"|journal=The Historian|volume=64|issue=3/4|pages=738<U+2013>739| date =Spring/Summer 2002  | id = {{issn|0018-2370}} }}</ref> Shiell commented on the views put forth by the author in the book, "Curtis does not limit this erudite work to historical narration. He also addresses political and legal movements and ideas that influenced and were influenced by free-speech controversies such as theories of democracy, justifications for broad protections of free speech, and the doctrines of content neutrality and heckler's veto. His treatment of justifications for suppression is especially valuable."<ref name="shiell" /> Shiell concluded his review noting, "For at least these three reasons--the historical detail, the review of relevant legal and political theory, and the lessons from history--this book is a 'must read' for anyone interested in the period from 1798 to 1870 or in the development of free-speech theory and practice in the United States."<ref name="shiell" />

Gordon Moran reviewed the book for the ''Journal of Information Ethics'', and noted, "In this book, Prof. Curtis (Wake Forest University School of Law) provides a thorough account of the evolution of free speech, in theory and practice, from pre-Revolutionary times through the Civil War and the Fourteenth Amendment (1868). As a history book, it is worthy of being in the library of every high school, college, and university that teaches American history, and would also be very useful and instructive as a textbook for university courses in American studies and advanced courses in American history."<ref name="moran">{{cite journal|first=Gordon|last=Moran|journal=Journal of Information Ethics|title=Free Speech, "The People's Darling Privilege"|date=Spring 2004|volume=13|issue=1|pages=91-93|issn=1061-9321|location=United States}}</ref> In a review of the book for ''The Journal of Southern History'', William Pannill wrote critically, "This is more a work of history than of law. Although the author summarizes the reasoning of legislatures and courts that overrode the First Amendment, he does not analyze the unfolding of constitutional doctrines."<ref name="pannill">{{cite journal|last=Pannill|first=William|journal=The Journal of Southern History|title=Free Speech, "The People's Darling Privilege"|volume=68|issue=3|date=August 2002|pages=686-688|issn=0022-4642|doi=10.2307/3070178|location=United States}}</ref> Pannill concluded, "At 437 pages of text, the book is too long. The writing suffers from repetition. For example, the author reminds us again and again that the southern states feared that debates over slavery would lead to slave revolts-one time was sufficient to make the point. The chapters also jump around in time and subject. Pruning and redrafting would have improved the book for a wider audience. The story certainly deserves one."<ref name="pannill" />

In his book ''Freedom of Speech: A Reference Guide to the United States Constitution'', author Keith Werhan placed ''Free Speech, "The People's Darling Privilege"'' among "leading works on free speech" during the [[American Civil War]].<ref name="werhan" /> Werhan noted that the book includes "excellent discussions" of the [[Alien and Sedition Acts]].<ref name="werhan">{{cite book|last=Werhan|first=Keith|title=Freedom of Speech: A Reference Guide to the United States Constitution|publisher=[[Praeger]]|year=2004|isbn=0313319979|pages=151-154}}</ref> In addition to Werhan, Steven J.
