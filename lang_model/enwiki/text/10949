The '''''Biuro Szyfr<U+00F3>w''''' ({{IPA-pl|<U+02C8>b<U+02B2>ur<U+0254> <U+02C8><U+0282><U+0268>fruf||Pl-Biuro_Szyfr<U+00F3>w.ogg}}, [[Polish language|Polish]] for "'''Cipher Bureau'''") was the [[interwar]] [[Polish General Staff]]'s agency charged with both [[cryptography]] (the ''use'' of [[cipher]]s and [[code]]s) and [[Cryptography#Terminology|cryptology]] (the study of ciphers and codes, particularly for the purpose of "''breaking''" them).

The precursor of the agency that would become the Cipher Bureau was created in May 1919, during the [[Polish-Soviet War]] (1919<U+2013>21), and played a vital role in securing Poland's survival in that war.

In mid-1931, the Cipher Bureau was formed by the merger of pre-existing agencies. In December 1932, the Bureau began breaking [[Germany]]'s [[Enigma machine|Enigma]] [[cipher]]s. Over the next seven years, Polish cryptologists overcame the growing structural and operating complexities of the [[plugboard]]-equipped Enigma. The Bureau also broke [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] cryptography.

Five weeks before the outbreak of [[World War II]], on 25 July 1939, in [[Warsaw]], the Polish Cipher Bureau revealed its Enigma-decryption techniques and equipment to representatives of French and British [[military intelligence]], which had been unable to make any headway against Enigma. This Polish intelligence-and-technology transfer would give the [[Allies in World War II|Allies]] an unprecedented advantage ([[Ultra]]) in their ultimately victorious prosecution of [[World War II]].

On 8 May 1919, a [[Polish Army]] "Cipher Section" (''Sekcja Szyfr<U+00F3>w''), precursor to the "Cipher Bureau" (''Biuro Szyfr<U+00F3>w''), was created by Lt. [[J<U+00F3>zef Serafin Stanslicki]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Bury|2004}}</ref> The Cipher Section reported to the [[Polish General Staff]] and contributed substantially to Poland's defense by [[J<U+00F3>zef Pi<U+0142>sudski]]'s forces during the [[Polish-Soviet War]] of 1919<U+2013>21, thereby helping preserve Poland's independence, recently regained in the wake of [[World War I]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Woytak|1988|pp=497<U+2013>500}}</ref> The ''Cipher'' Section's purview included both [[cipher]]s and [[code (cryptography)|code]]s.<ref name="<U+015A>cie<U+017C>y<U+0144>ski">{{Harvnb|<U+015A>cie<U+017C>y<U+0144>ski|1928}}</ref> In loose [[Polish language|Polish]] parlance, the term "cipher" ("''szyfr''") refers to ''both'' these two principal categories of [[cryptography]].<ref name="<U+015A>cie<U+017C>y<U+0144>ski"/> (The opposite is the practice in [[English language|English]], which loosely refers to ''both'' [[code]]s and [[cipher]]s as "codes."<ref>{{Harvnb|Kahn|1996}}</ref>)

During the [[Polish<U+2013>Soviet War]] (1919<U+2013>1921), some one hundred Russian ciphers were broken by a sizable cadre of Polish cryptologists who included Army Lt. [[Jan Kowalewski]] and three world-famous professors of mathematics <U+2014> [[Stefan Mazurkiewicz]], [[Wac<U+0142>aw Sierpi<U+0144>ski]] and [[Stanis<U+0142>aw Le<U+015B>niewski]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Nowik|2004|pp=25<U+2013>26}}</ref> Russian army staffs were still following the same disastrously ill-disciplined signals-security procedures as had [[Tsarist]] army staffs during [[World War I]], to the decisive advantage of their German enemy.<ref name="<U+015A>cie<U+017C>y<U+0144>ski"/> As a result, during the Polish-Soviet War the Polish military were regularly kept informed by Russian signals stations about the movements of Russian armies and their intentions and operational orders.<ref name="<U+015A>cie<U+017C>y<U+0144>ski"/>

The Russian staffs, according to Polish Colonel Mieczys<U+0142>aw <U+015A>cie<U+017C>y<U+0144>ski, "had not the slightest hesitation about sending any and all messages of an operational nature by means of radiotelegraphy; there were periods during the war when, for purposes of operational communications and for purposes of command by higher staffs, no other means of communication whatever were used, messages being transmitted either entirely ("in clear," or [[plaintext]]) or encrypted by means of such an incredibly uncomplicated system that for our trained specialists reading the messages was child's play. The same held for the chitchat of personnel at radiotelegraphic stations, where discipline was disastrously lax."<ref>{{Harvnb|<U+015A>cie<U+017C>y<U+0144>ski|1928| pp=16<U+2013>17}}</ref>

In the crucial month of August 1920 alone, Polish cryptologists [[decryption|decrypted]] 410 signals:  from Soviet General [[Mikhail Tukhachevsky]], commander of the northern front; from [[Leon Trotsky]], Soviet commissar of war; from commanders of armies, e.g. the commander of the IV Army, Sergieyev; the commander of the Horse Army, [[Semyon Budionny]]; the commander of the 3 Cavalry Corps, Gaya; from the staffs of the XII, XV and XVI Armies; from the staffs of the [[Mozyr]] Group (named after the [[Belarus]]sian city); the [[Zolochiv]] Group (after the [[Ukraine|Ukrainian]] town); the Yakir Group [after General [[Iona Emmanuilovich Yakir]]]; from the 2, 4, 7, 10, 11, 12, 16, 17, 18, 24, 27, 41, 44, 45, 53, 54, 58 and 60 Infantry Divisions; from the 8 Cavalry Division, etc.<ref>{{Harvnb|<U+015A>cie<U+017C>y<U+0144>ski|1928|p=19}}</ref>

The intercepts were as a rule [[decryption|decrypted]] the same day, or at latest the next day, and were immediately sent to the Polish [[General Staff]]'s Section II (Intelligence) and operational section.  The more important signals were read in their entirety by the Chief of the General Staff, and even by the [[Commander in Chief]], Marshal [[J<U+00F3>zef Pi<U+0142>sudski]].<ref>{{Harvnb|<U+015A>cie<U+017C>y<U+0144>ski|1928|pp=19<U+2013>20}}</ref> Interception and reading of the signals provided Polish intelligence with entire Russian operational orders.  The Poles were able to follow the whole operation of [[Budionny]]'s Horse Army in the second half of August 1920 with incredible precision, just by monitoring his radiotelegraphic correspondence with [[Tukhachevsky]], including the famous and historic conflict between the two Russian commanders.<ref>{{Harvnb|<U+015A>cie<U+017C>y<U+0144>ski|1928|p=25}}</ref>

The intercepts even included an order from [[Trotsky]] to the revolutionary council of war of the Western Front, confirming Tukhachevsky's operational orders, thus giving them the authority of the supreme chief of the Soviet armed forces.<ref>{{Harvnb|<U+015A>cie<U+017C>y<U+0144>ski|1928|pp=25<U+2013>26}}</ref> An entire operational order from Tukhachevsky to Budionny was intercepted on 19 August and read on 20 August, stating the tasks of all of Tukhachevsky's armies, of which only the essence had previously been known.<ref name="<U+015A>cie<U+017C>y<U+0144>skiP26">{{Harvnb|<U+015A>cie<U+017C>y<U+0144>ski|1928|p=26}}</ref>

<U+015A>cie<U+017C>y<U+0144>ski surmises that the Soviets must likewise have intercepted Polish operational signals; but he doubts that this would have availed them much since Polish cryptography "stood abreast of modern cryptography" and since only a small number of Polish higher headquarters were equipped with [[radio station]]s, of which there was a great shortage; and finally, Polish headquarters were more cautious than the Russians and almost every Polish [[division (military)|division]] had the use of a [[land line]].<ref name="<U+015A>cie<U+017C>y<U+0144>skiP26"/>

Polish cryptologists enjoyed generous support under the command of Col. [[Tadeusz Schaetzel]], chief of the [[History of Polish Intelligence Services|Polish General Staff's Section II (Intelligence)]].  They worked at [[Warsaw]]'s radio station ''WAR'', one of two Polish long-range radio transmitters at the time. The Polish cryptologists' work led, among many other things, to discovery of a large gap on the [[Red Army]]'s left flank, which enabled Poland's Marshal [[J<U+00F3>zef Pi<U+0142>sudski]] to drive a war-winning wedge into that gap during the August 1920 [[Battle of Warsaw (1920)|Battle of Warsaw]].<ref name="<U+015A>cie<U+017C>y<U+0144>skiP26"/>

==Cipher Bureau==
In mid-1931, at the Polish [[General Staff]], a Cipher Bureau was formed by merging the Radio-Intelligence Office (''Referat Radiowywiadu'') and the Polish-Cryptography Office (''Referat Szyfr<U+00F3>w W<U+0142>asnych'').<ref name="Kozaczuk84P23N6">{{Harvnb|Kozaczuk|1984|p=23}}, note 6</ref> The Bureau was charged with both [[cryptography]] <U+2014> the generation, and supervision of the ''use'', of [[cipher]]s and [[code]]s <U+2014> and [[Cryptography#Terminology|cryptology]], the study of ciphers and codes, particularly for the purpose of "''breaking''" them.<ref>{{Harvnb|Kozaczuk|1984|p=212}}</ref>

Between 1932 and 1936, the Cipher Bureau took on additional responsibilities, including radio communications between [[military intelligence|military-intelligence]] posts in Poland and abroad, as well as radio [[counterintelligence]] <U+2014> mobile [[direction finding|direction-finding]] and intercept stations for the locating and [[traffic analysis|traffic-analysis]] of [[espionage|spy]] and [[fifth column|fifth-column]] transmitters operating in Poland.<ref name="Kozaczuk84P23N6" />

==Stalking Enigma==
{{main|Cryptanalysis of the Enigma}}
[[File:EnigmaMachineLabeled.jpg|thumb|The [[Enigma machine]] was an electro-mechanical [[rotor machine]] with a scrambler consisting of (from right to left) an entry drum, three rotors and a reflector. It was available commercially from the early 1920s and was modified for use by the German military who adopted it later in the decade.]] [[File:MR 1932 small.jpg|thumb|125px|[[Marian Rejewski]], ca. 1932]]
In late 1927 or early 1928, there arrived at the Warsaw Customs Office from Germany a package that, according to the accompanying declaration, was supposed to contain radio equipment.  The German firm's representative strenuously demanded that the package be returned to Germany even before going through customs, as it had been shipped with other equipment by mistake.  His insistent demands alerted the customs officials, who notified the Polish General Staff's Cipher Bureau, which took a keen interest in new developments in radio technology.  And since it happened to be a Saturday afternoon, the Bureau's experts had ample time to look into the matter.  They carefully opened the box and found that it did not, in fact, contain radio equipment but a cipher machine.  They examined the machine minutely, then put it back into the box.<ref name="Rejewski84P246-7">{{Harvnb|Rejewski|1984d|pp=246<U+2013>7}}</ref>

The Bureau's leading Enigma cryptanalyst [[Marian Rejewski]] commented that the cipher machine may be surmised to have been a ''commercial''-model Enigma, since at that time the military model had not yet been devised. "Hence this trivial episode was of no practical importance, though it does fix the date at which the Cipher Bureau's interest in the Enigma machine began"{{spaced ndash}}manifested, initially, in the entirely legal acquisition of a single commercial-model Enigma.<ref name="Rejewski84P246-7"/>

On 15 July 1928 the first German machine-enciphered messages were broadcast by German military radio stations.  Polish monitoring stations began intercepting them, and cryptologists in the Polish Cipher Bureau's German section were instructed to try to read them.  The effort was fruitless, however, and was eventually abandoned.  There remained very slight evidence of the effort, in the form of a few densely written-over sheets of paper and the commercial-model Enigma machine.<ref name="Rejewski84P246-7"/> On 15 January 1929 Major [[Gwido Langer]], after a tour of duty as chief of staff of the [[Polish 1st Legions Infantry Division|1st Legion Infantry Division]], became chief of the Radio-Intelligence Office, and subsequently of the Cipher Bureau.<ref name="Kozaczuk84P23N6" /> The Bureau's deputy chief, and the chief of its German section (''BS-4''), was Captain [[Maksymilian Ci<U+0119><U+017C>ki]].

In 1929, while the Cipher Bureau's predecessor agency was still headed by Major Franciszek Pokorny (a relative of the outstanding [[World War I]] [[Austro-Hungarian Army]] cryptologist, Captain [[Herman Pokorny]]<ref name="Rejewski84P246-7"/>), Ci<U+0119><U+017C>ki, Franciszek Pokorny and a civilian Bureau employee, [[Antoni Palluth]], taught a secret [[cryptology]] course at [[Pozna<U+0144> University]] for selected mathematics students.  Over ten years later, during [[World War II]] while in [[France]], one of the students, [[Marian Rejewski]], would discover that the entire course had been taught from French General Marcel Givi<U+00E8>rge's book, ''Cours de cryptographie'' (Course of Cryptography), published in 1925.<ref name="RejewskiWoytak84P230-1">{{Harvnb|Rejewski|Woytak|1984b|pp=230<U+2013>231}}</ref>

In September 1932, Maksymilian Ci<U+0119><U+017C>ki hired three young graduates of the Pozna<U+0144> course to be Bureau staff members: [[Marian Rejewski]], [[Jerzy R<U+00F3><U+017C>ycki]] and [[Henryk Zygalski]].<ref name="RejewskiWoytak84P230-1"/>

==Successes and setbacks==
In 1926 the German Navy adopted, as its top cryptographic device, a modified civilian [[Enigma machine]]; in 1928 the German Army followed suit.<ref>{{Harvnb|Kozaczuk|1984|p=xiii}}</ref> The complexity of the system was much increased in 1930 by the introduction of a plugboard (''Steckerbrett''), albeit with only six connecting leads in use.<ref>{{Citation | last = Sale | first = Tony | author-link = Tony Sale | title = Anoraks Corner: a quick revision of the Enigma machine, its physical and operational characteristics | url = http://www.codesandciphers.org.uk/anoraks/enigma.htm | accessdate = 5 June 2011 }}</ref> In December 1932, [[Marian Rejewski]] made what historian [[David Kahn (writer)|David Kahn]] describes as one of the greatest advances in cryptologic history, by applying pure [[mathematics]]{{spaced ndash}}the [[Permutation group|theory of permutations and groups]]{{spaced ndash}}to breaking the [[Wehrmacht|German armed forces']] Enigma machine ciphers.<ref>{{Harvnb|Kahn|1996|p=974}}</ref><ref name="RejewskiWoytak84P234-236" >{{Harvnb|Rejewski|Woytak|1984|pp=234<U+2013>236}}</ref> Rejewski had worked out the precise interconnections of the Enigma rotors and reflector, after the Bureau had received, from French Military Intelligence Captain [[Gustave Bertrand]], two German documents and two pages of Enigma daily keys (for September and October of that year).<ref>{{Harvnb|Rejewski|Woytak|1984b|p=256}}</ref> These had been obtained by a French [[military intelligence]] agent, a German codenamed ''Rex'',<ref>''Rex'' had been born Rudolf Stallmann in Berlin in 1871 and had changed his surname to his French wife's, becoming "Rodolphe Lemoine" {{Harvnb|Kahn|1991|p=57}}</ref> from an agent who worked at Germany's Cipher Office in Berlin, [[Hans Thilo-Schmidt]], whom the French codenamed ''Asch<U+00E9>''.<ref>The documents were entitled ''Gebrauchsanweisung f<U+00FC>r die Chiffriermaschine Enigma'' (Instructions for Using the Enigma Cipher Machine) and ''Schl<U+00FC>sselanleitung f<U+00FC>r die Chiffriermaschine Enigma'' (Keying Instructions for the Enigma Cipher Machine).</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Kozaczuk|1984|pp=258<U+2013>259}}</ref>

After Rejewski had worked out the military Enigma's logical structure, the Polish Cipher Bureau commissioned the [[AVA Radio Company]], co-owned by [[Antoni Palluth]], to build replicas ([[Polish Enigma doubles|"doubles"]]) of the Enigma to Rejewski's specifications.<ref>{{Harvnb|Kozaczuk|1984|p=25}}</ref> His method of decrypting Enigma messages exploited two weaknesses of the German operating procedures.<ref>These were that the [[Cryptanalysis of the Enigma#Early indicator procedures|indicator setting]] was defined for the day on the key-setting sheets and that the 3-letter indicator was sent twice as six letters of [[ciphertext]].</ref> It used what Rejewski called "characteristics" that were independent of the plugboard connections.<ref>{{Harvnb|Hodges|1992|p=170}}</ref> This involved compiling a [[Card catalog (cryptology)|card catalog]] of certain features of the set of [[Enigma machine#Indicator|indicator]] settings.<ref>There were 26 <U+00D7> 26 <U+00D7> 26 = 17,576 possible rotor positions for each of the six rotor orders, giving a total of 105,456 possible indicators.</ref>

The Germans increased the difficulty of decrypting Enigma messages by decreasing the interval between changes in the order of the rotors from quarterly, initially, to monthly in February 1936, then daily in October of that year, when they also increased the number of plugboard leads from six to a number that varied between five and eight. This made the Biuro's [[Grill (cryptology)|grill method]] much less easy,<ref>{{Harvnb|Calvocoressi|2001|p=38}} citing {{Harvnb|Rejewski|1984d|p=263}}</ref>  as it relied on ''unsteckered'' letter pairs.<ref name="Harvnb|Rejewski|1984c|p=242">{{Harvnb|Rejewski|1984c|p=242}}</ref> The German navy was more security-conscious than the army and air force, and in May 1937 it introduced a new, much more secure, indicator procedure that remained unbroken for several years.<ref>{{Citation | last = Supreme Command of the Navy | title = The Enigma General Procedure (Der Schluessel M Verfahren M Allgemein) | work = The Bletchley Park translated Enigma Instruction Manual, transcribed and formatted by [[Anthony Sale|Tony Sale]] | place = Berlin | publisher = Supreme Command of the German Navy | year = 1940 | url = http://www.codesandciphers.org.uk/documents/egenproc/egenproc.pdf | accessdate = 26 November 2009 }}</ref>

The next setback occurred in November 1937, when the scrambler's reflector was changed to one with different interconnections (known as ''Umkehrwalze-B'').  Rejewski worked out the wiring in the new reflector, but the catalog of characteristics had to be compiled anew, again using Rejewski's "[[cyclometer]]", which had been built to his specifications by the AVA Radio Company.<ref>{{Harvnb|Rejewski|1984d|p=264}}</ref>

In January 1938, Colonel [[Stefan Mayer]] directed that statistics be compiled for a two-week period, comparing the numbers of Enigma messages solved, to Enigma intercepts.  The ratio came to 75 percent.  "Nor," [[Marian Rejewski]] has commented, "were those 75 percent&nbsp;... the limit of our possibilities.  With slightly augmented personnel, we might have attained about 90 percent&nbsp;... read.  But a certain amount of cipher material&nbsp;... due to faulty transmission or&nbsp;... reception, or to various other causes, always remains unread&nbsp;..."<ref>{{Harvnb|Rejewski|1984d|p=265}}</ref> Information obtained from Enigma decryption seems to have been directed from B.S.-4 principally to the German Office of the General Staff's Section II (Intelligence).  There, from fall 1935 to mid-April 1939, it was worked up by Major [[Jan Le<U+015B>niak]], who in April 1939 would turn the German Office over to another officer and himself form a Situation Office intended for wartime service.  He would head the Situation Office to and through the [[Invasion of Poland (1939)|September 1939 Campaign]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Kozaczuk|1984|pp=58, 64<U+2013>66}}</ref>

[[File:P<U+0142>achta Zygalskiego - decrypting Enigma.jpg|thumb|A [[Zygalski sheets|Zygalski perforated sheet]] (1938)]]
The system of pre-defining the indicator setting for the day for all Enigma operators on a given network, on which the method of characteristics depended, was changed on 15 September 1938. The one exception to this was the network used by the ''[[Sicherheitsdienst]]'' (SD)<U+2014>the intelligence agency of the [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] and the [[Nazi Party]]<U+2014>who did not make the change until 1 July 1939. Operators now chose their own indicator setting. However, the insecure procedure of sending the enciphered message key twice, remained in use, and it was quickly exploited. Henryk Zygalski devised a manual method that used 26 [[Zygalski sheets|perforated sheets]], and Marian Rejewski commissioned the AVA company to produce the ''[[Bomba (cryptography)|bomba kryptologiczna]]'' (cryptologic bomb).<ref>{{Harvnb|Kozaczuk|1984|pp=53, 212}}</ref>

Both the Zygalski-sheet method and each ''bomba'' worked for only a single scrambler rotor order, so six sets of Zygalski sheets and six ''bomby'' were produced.<ref>''Bomby'' is the plural of ''bomba''.</ref> However, the Germans introduced two new rotors on 15 December 1938, giving a choice of three out of five to assemble in the machines on a given day.<ref>{{Harvnb|Herivel|2001|p=39}}, citing {{Harvnb|Rejwski|1984d|p=269}}</ref> This increased the number of possible rotor orders from 6 to 60. The Biuro could then only read the small minority of messages that used neither of the two new rotors. They did not have the resources to produce 54 more ''bomby'' or 54 sets of Zygalski sheets. Fortunately, however, the fact that the SD network was still using the old method of the same indicator setting for all messages, allowed Rejewski to re-use his previous method of working out the wiring within these rotors.<ref>{{Harvnb|Herivel|2001|pp=39<U+2013>40}}</ref> This information was essential for the production of a full set Zygalski sheets which allowed resumption of large-scale decryption in January 1940. On 1 January 1939, the Germans made military Enigma even more difficult to break by increasing the number of plugboard connections from between five and eight, to between seven and ten.<ref name="Harvnb|Rejewski|1984c|p=242"/>

When [[World War II]] broke out on 1 September 1939, Le<U+015B>niak and his colleagues had been working intensively for two or three years to establish the German [[order of battle]] and had succeeded in working out nearly 95 percent of it. The German attack on Poland came as no surprise to the [[Polish General Staff]]. The results that had been obtained by [[Polish intelligence]], according to Le<U+015B>niak, "absolutely exceeded what would normally have been possible."<ref>{{Harvnb|Kozaczuk|1984|p=66}}</ref>

==Kabaty Woods==
{{EnigmaSeries}}
Until 1937 the Cipher Bureau's German section, ''BS-4'', had been housed in the Polish General Staff building <U+2014> the stately 18th-century [[Pa<U+0142>ac Saski|"Saxon Palace"]] <U+2014> in Warsaw. That year BS-4 moved into specially constructed new facilities in the [[Kabaty|Kabaty Woods]] near [[Pyry]], south of Warsaw.  There, working conditions were incomparably better than in the cramped quarters at the General Staff building.<ref name="Kozaczuk84P43">{{Harvnb|Kozaczuk|1984|p=43}}</ref>

The move was dictated as well by requirements of security.  Germany's ''[[Abwehr]]'' was always looking for potential traitors among the military and civilian workers at the General Staff building. Strolling agents, even if lacking access to the Staff building, could observe personnel entering and leaving, and photograph them with concealed miniature cameras. Annual ''Abwehr'' intelligence assignments for German agents in Warsaw placed a priority on securing informants at the Polish General Staff.<ref name="Kozaczuk84P43"/>

When Rejewski had been working on reconstructing the German military Enigma machine in late 1932, he had ultimately solved a crucial element, the wiring of the letters of the alphabet into the entry drum, with the inspired guess that they might be wired in simple ''alphabetical'' order.  Now, at the trilateral meeting{{spaced ndash}}Rejewski was later to recount{{spaced ndash}}"the first question that&nbsp;... [[Alfred Dillwyn Knox|Dillwyn Knox]] asked was: 'What are the connections in the entry drum?{{'"}}  Knox was mortified to learn how simple the answer was.<ref>{{Harvnb|Rejewski|1984d|p=257}}</ref>

The Poles' gift, to their western Allies, of Enigma decryption, five weeks before the outbreak of World War II, came not a moment too soon.  Former [[Bletchley Park]] mathematician-cryptologist [[Gordon Welchman]] has written:  "[[Ultra]] [Allied high-grade [[signals intelligence]]] would never have gotten off the ground if we had not learned from the Poles, in the nick of time, the details both of the German military&nbsp;... [[Enigma machine]], and of the operating procedures that were in use."<ref>{{Harvnb|Welchman|1982|p=289}}</ref>  After the war, Britain's Prime Minister [[Winston Churchill]] was to tell [[George VI of the United Kingdom|King George VI]]:  "It was thanks to Ultra that we won the war."<ref>Cited in a 2003 [[Imperial War Museum]] exhibit on "Secret War."</ref> Allied Supreme Commander [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]], at war's end, described intelligence from Bletchley Park as having been "of priceless value to me. It has simplified my task as a commander enormously."  Eisenhower expressed his thanks for this "decisive contribution to the Allied war effort."<ref>{{Harvnb|Winterbotham|1975|pp=16<U+2013>17}}</ref>

Churchill's greatest wartime fear, even after Hitler had suspended [[Operation Sea Lion]] and [[Operation Barbarossa|invaded the Soviet Union]], was that the German submarine [[Wolfpack (naval tactic)|wolfpack]]s would succeed in strangling sea-locked Britain.<ref>[[Winston Churchill]], ''Their Finest Hour'', pp. 598<U+2013>600.</ref>  A major factor that averted Britain's defeat in the [[Battle of the Atlantic (1939<U+2013>1945)|Battle of the Atlantic]] was her regained mastery of Naval Enigma decryption; and while the latter benefited crucially from British seizure of German Enigma-equipped naval vessels, the breaking of German naval signals ultimately relied on techniques that had been pioneered by the Polish Cipher Bureau.<ref>{{Harvnb|Kahn|1991}}</ref>  Had Britain capitulated to Hitler, the [[United States]] would have been deprived of an essential forward base for its subsequent involvement in the [[Europe]]an and [[North Africa]]n theaters.<ref>[[Christopher Kasparek]], review of [[Michael Alfred Peszke]], ''The Polish Underground Army, the Western Allies, and the Failure of Strategic Unity in World War II'', 2005, in ''[[The Polish Review]]'', vol. L, no. 2, 2005, p. 240.</ref>

A week after the Pyry meeting, [[Dillwyn Knox]], in a letter dated 1 August 1939, thanked the Poles, in Polish, "for your cooperation and patience."  He enclosed little paper batons and a scarf picturing a [[Derby (horse race)|Derby horse race]]{{spaced ndash}}evidently emblematic of the cryptological race that Knox had hoped to win using the batons, and whose loss he was gallantly acknowledging.<ref>{{Harvnb|Kozaczuk|1984|p=60}}</ref>

On 5 September 1939, as it became clear that Poland was unlikely to halt the ongoing German invasion, BS-4 received orders to destroy part of its files and evacuate essential personnel.<ref>{{Harvnb|Kozaczuk|1984|p=70}}</ref>

==Bureau abroad==
[[File:Gwido Langer Gustave Bertrand Kenneth McFarlan.jpg|thumb|200px|''[[PC Bruno]]'' during the [[Phony War]]. ''From left'': Polish Lt. Col. [[Gwido Langer]], French Major [[Gustave Bertrand]], British Capt. Kenneth ("Pinky") McFarlan.]]
During the [[Polish Defensive War|German invasion of Poland]] in September 1939, key Cipher Bureau personnel were evacuated southeast and&mdash;after the Soviets invaded eastern Poland on 17 September&mdash;into Romania, on the way destroying their cryptological equipment and documentation.  Eventually, crossing Yugoslavia and still-neutral Italy, they reached France.  Some personnel of the Cipher Bureau's German section who had worked with Enigma, and most of the workers at the AVA Radio Company that had built [[Polish Enigma doubles|Enigma doubles]] and cryptologic equipment for the German section, remained in Poland. Some were interrogated by the [[Gestapo]], but no one gave away the secret of Polish mastery of Enigma decryption.<ref>{{Harvnb|Kozaczuk|1984|pp=211<U+2013>16}}</ref>

At ''[[PC Bruno]]'', outside [[Paris]], on 20 October 1939 the Poles resumed work on German Enigma ciphers in close collaboration with Britain's [[Government Communications Headquarters#Government Code and Cypher School|Government Code and Cypher School]] at [[Bletchley Park]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Kozaczuk|1984|pp=69<U+2013>94, 104<U+2013>11}}</ref>

In the interest of security, the allied cryptological services, before sending their messages over a [[teleprinter]] line, encrypted them using ''[[Polish Enigma doubles|Enigma doubles]]''.  [[Henri Braqueni<U+00E9>]] often closed messages with an ironic "''[[Heil Hitler]]!''"<ref>{{Harvnb|Kozaczuk|1984|pp=70<U+2013>87}}</ref>

As late as December 1939, when Lt. Col. [[Gwido Langer]], accompanied by Captain [[Henri Braqueni<U+00E9>|Braqueni<U+00E9>]], visited London and Bletchley Park, the British asked that the Polish cryptologists be turned over to them.  Langer, however, took the position that the Polish team must remain where the [[Polish Armed Forces]] were being formed{{spaced ndash}}on [[France|French]] soil.<ref>{{Harvnb|Kozaczuk|1984|pp=99, 102}}</ref>  The mathematicians might actually have reached Britain much earlier{{spaced ndash}}and much more comfortably{{spaced ndash}}than they eventually did; but in September 1939, when they went to the British embassy in [[Bucharest]], Romania, they were brushed off by a preoccupied British diplomat.<ref>{{Harvnb|Kozaczuk|1984|p=79}}</ref>

In January 1940, the British cryptanalyst [[Alan Turing]] spent several days at PC Bruno conferring with his Polish colleagues. He had brought the Poles a full set of [[Zygalski sheets]] that had been produced at Bletchley Park by [[John R.F. Jeffreys|John Jeffreys]] using Polish-supplied information. On 17 January 1940, the Poles made the first break into wartime Enigma traffic<U+2014>that from 28 October 1939.<ref>{{Harvnb|Kozaczuk|1984|pp=84; 94}}, note 8</ref>

During this period, until the collapse of France in June 1940, ultimately 83 percent of the Enigma keys that were found, were solved at Bletchley Park, the remaining 17 percent at PC Bruno. Rejewski commented: {{blockquote|How could it be otherwise, when there were three of us [Polish cryptologists] and [there were] at least several hundred British cryptologists, since about 10,000 people worked in Bletchley... Besides, recovery of keys also depended on the amount of intercepted cipher material, and that amount was far greater on the British side than on the French side. Finally, in France (by contrast with the work in Poland) we ourselves not only sought for the daily keys, but after finding the key also read the messages.... One can only be surprised that the Poles had as many as 17 percent of the keys to their credit.<ref>[[Marian Rejewski|Rejewski]] (1982) pp. 81<U+2013>82</ref><ref>Also quoted in {{Harvnb|Kozaczuk|1984||p=102}}</ref><ref>Actually, at this early stage of the war there were nowhere near 10,000 people working at Bletchley Park. Still, there doubtless were a good many more working there than at ''[[PC Bruno]]'', outside Paris.</ref>}}

The inter-Allied cryptologic collaboration prevented duplication of effort and facilitated discoveries. Before fighting had started in [[Norway]] in April 1940, the Polish-French team solved an uncommonly hard three-letter [[code (cryptography)|code]] used by the Germans to communicate with fighter and bomber squadrons and for exchange of meteorological data between aircraft and land.<ref name="Kozaczuk84P87" >{{Harvnb|Kozaczuk|1984|p=87}}</ref>  The code had first appeared in December 1939, but the Polish cryptologists had been too preoccupied with Enigma to give the code much attention.<ref name="Kozaczuk84P87" /> With the German assault on the west impending, however, the breaking of the ''[[Luftwaffe]]'' code took on mounting urgency. The trail of the elusive code (whose system of letters changed every 24 hours) led back to Enigma. The first clue came from the British, who had noticed that the code's letters did not change randomly. If ''A'' changed to ''P'', then elsewhere ''P'' was replaced by ''A''. The British made no further headway, but the Poles realized that what was manifesting was Enigma's ''exclusivity principle'' that they had discovered in 1932. The Germans' carelessness meant that now the Poles, having after midnight solved Enigma's daily setting, could with no further effort also read the ''Luftwaffe'' signals.<ref>{{Harvnb|Kozaczuk|1984|pp=87<U+2013>88}}</ref><ref>[[Hugh Sebag-Montefiore]], in reliance on Rejewski's unpublished 1967 ''Memoirs'', gives a slightly different interpretation, apparently of the same episode:  "The German Air Force was using an uncomplicated code for the weather forecasts it was relaying back to base. The substitutions involved in this code changed every day and the British codebreakers had spotted that they were always the same as the connections for the plugboard sockets on the Air Force Enigma system. So, as soon as the code was broken, the codebreakers knew the plugboard connections for the Air Force Enigma." [[Hugh Sebag-Montefiore|Sebag-Montefiore]] (2004) pp. 87, 368</ref>

The Germans, just before opening their 10 May 1940 offensive in the west that would trample [[Belgium]], [[Luxembourg]] and the [[Netherlands]] in order to reach the borders of France, once again changed their procedure for enciphering message keys, rendering the Zygalski sheets "completely useless"<ref>{{Harvnb|Rejewski|1984c|p=243}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Rejewski|1984d|pp=269<U+2013>70}}</ref> and temporarily defeating the joint British-Polish cryptologic attacks on Enigma. According to [[Gustave Bertrand]], "It took ''superhuman'' day-and-night effort to overcome this new difficulty: on May 20, decryption resumed."<ref>[[Gustave Bertrand|Bertrand]] (1973) pp. 88<U+2013>89</ref><ref>According to [[Gwido Langer]], the interruption in decryption was shorter, 13<U+2013>19 May 1940. {{Harvnb|Kozaczuk|1984|p=115}}, note 2</ref>

Following the capitulation of France in June 1940, the Poles were evacuated to [[Algeria]].  On October 1, 1940, they resumed work at "''[[Cadix]]''", near [[Uz<U+00E8>s]] in unoccupied southern, [[Vichy France]], under the sponsorship of Gustave Bertrand.<ref>{{Harvnb|Kozaczuk|1984|pp=112<U+2013>18}}</ref>

A little over two years later, on 8 November 1942, Bertrand learned from the [[BBC]] that the Allies had landed in [[French North Africa]] ("[[Operation Torch]]"). Knowing that in such an eventuality the Germans planned to occupy [[Vichy France]], on 9 November he evacuated [[Cadix]]. Two days later, on 11 November, the Germans indeed marched into southern France.  On the morning of 12 November they occupied Cadix.<ref>{{Harvnb|Kozaczuk|1984|p=139}}</ref>

Over the two years since its establishment in October 1940, [[Cadix]] had decrypted thousands of [[Wehrmacht]], [[SS]] and [[Gestapo]] messages, originating not only from French territory but from across Europe, which provided invaluable intelligence to Allied commands and [[Resistance during World War II|resistance movement]]s.<ref>{{Harvnb|Kozaczuk|1984|pp=139<U+2013>40}}</ref><ref>It is not clear, however, whether, after the June 1940 fall of France, the Cipher Bureau had broken ''Enigma''. Rejewski, the principal Polish source, wrote in a posthumously published 1980 paper that at [[Cadix]] "We worked on other ciphers, no longer on Enigma." ({{Harvnb|Kozaczuk|1984|p=270}}) Colonel [[Stefan Mayer]] of Polish Intelligence, however, mentioned the Poles breaking "interesting [machine-enciphered messages] from [Germany's 1941] [[Balkan]] campaign coming [in over] the 'Luftwaffe' network..." ({{Harvnb|Kozaczuk|1984|p=116}})  And French intelligence Gen. [[Gustave Bertrand]] wrote of Enigma having been read at Cadix. ({{Harvnb|Kozaczuk|1984|p=117}}) Tadeusz Lisicki, Rejewski's and Zygalski's immediate chief in wartime England but sometimes a dubious source, wrote in 1982 that "Rejewski in [a letter] conceded that Bertrand was doubtless right that at Cadix they had read Enigma, and that the number given by Bertrand, of 673 [Wehrmacht] telegrams, was correct.... The British did not send keys to Cadix; these were found using various tricks such as the sillies [and] [[Herivel tip]] described by [[Gordon Welchman|Welchman]], [[Alfred Dillwyn Knox|Knox]]'s method, as well as others that Rejewski no longer remembered." ({{Harvnb|Kozaczuk|1984|p=117}})</ref>  Cadix had also decrypted thousands of [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] messages.<ref>{{Harvnb|Kozaczuk|1984|p=116}}</ref>

Having departed Cadix, the Polish personnel evaded the occupying Italian security police and German [[Gestapo]] and sought to escape France via [[Spain]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Kozaczuk|1984|pp=148<U+2013>51}}</ref> [[Jerzy R<U+00F3><U+017C>ycki]], [[Jan Grali<U+0144>ski]] and [[Piotr Smole<U+0144>ski]] had died in the January 1942 sinking, in the [[Mediterranean Sea]], of a French passenger ship, the ''Lamorici<U+00E8>re'', in which they had been returning to southern France from a tour of duty in [[Algeria]].<ref>The ship had, appropriately, been christened after a 19th-century French general, [[Christophe L<U+00E9>on Louis Juchault de Lamorici<U+00E8>re]], who had been involved in France's conquest of [[Algeria]].</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Kozaczuk|1984|p=128}}</ref>

[[Marian Rejewski]] and [[Henryk Zygalski]] hiked over the [[Pyrenees]] with a guide (who robbed them at gunpoint) to the Spanish border, where they were arrested on January 30, 1943.<ref>{{Harvnb|Kozaczuk|1984|pp=150<U+2013>51}}</ref>  They were incarcerated by the Spaniards for three months before being released, upon [[Red Cross]] intervention, on 4 May 1943.<ref>{{Harvnb|Kozaczuk|1984|p=154}}</ref> They then managed, by a circuitous land<U+2013>sea<U+2013>air route, to join the [[Polish Armed Forces]] in Britain,<ref>{{Harvnb|Kozaczuk|1984|pp=205<U+2013>7}}</ref> Rejewski and Zygalski were inducted into the Polish Army as privates (they would eventually be promoted to lieutenant) and put to work breaking German ''[[SS]]'' and ''[[Sicherheitsdienst|SD]]'' hand ciphers at a Polish signals facility in [[Boxmoor]]. Because of their having been in occupied France, the British considered it too risky to invite them to work at Bletchley Park.<ref>{{Harvnb|Kozaczuk|1984|pp=148<U+2013>55, 205<U+2013>9}}</ref>

Finally, with the end of the two mathematicians' cryptologic work at the close of World War II, the Cipher Bureau ceased to exist. From nearly its inception in 1931 until war's end in 1945, the Bureau, sometimes incorporated into aggregates under [[cryptonym]]s (PC Bruno and Cadix), had been essentially the same agency, with most of the same core personnel, carrying out much the same tasks; now it was extinguished. Neither Rejewski nor Zygalski would work again as cryptologists.<ref name="Kozaczuk84P224" >{{Harvnb|Kozaczuk|1984|p=224}}</ref> In late 1946 Rejewski returned to his family in a devastated and politically altered Poland, to live there another 33 years until his death in February 1980.<ref>{{Harvnb|Kozaczuk|1984|pp=224<U+2013>26}}</ref> Zygalski would remain in England until his death in August 1978.<ref name="Kozaczuk84P224" />

==Secret preserved==
Despite their [[travail]]s, Rejewski and Zygalski had fared better than some of their colleagues. Cadix's Polish military chiefs, [[Gwido Langer|Langer]] and [[Maksymilian Ci<U+0119><U+017C>ki|Ci<U+0119><U+017C>ki]], had also been captured{{mdash}} by the Germans, as they tried to escape from France into Spain on the night of March 10<U+2013>11, 1943{{mdash}} along with three other Poles:  [[Antoni Palluth]], [[Edward Fokczy<U+0144>ski]] and Kazimierz Gaca.<ref>{{Harvnb|Kozaczuk|1984|pp=156, 220}}, note 4</ref> The first two became [[prisoners of war]]; the other three were sent as [[slave labor]]ers to Germany, where Palluth and Fokczy<U+0144>ski perished.<ref>{{Harvnb|Kozaczuk|1984|p=156}}</ref> Despite the varyingly dire circumstances in which they were held, none of them{{mdash}} [[Stefan Mayer]] emphasizes{{mdash}}  betrayed the secret of Enigma's [[decryption]], thus making it possible for the Allies to continue exploiting this vital intelligence resource.<ref>{{Harvnb|Kozaczuk|1984|p=220}}</ref>

Before the war, [[Antoni Palluth|Palluth]], a lecturer in the 1929 secret [[Pozna<U+0144> University]] [[cryptology]] course, had been co-owner of AVA, which produced equipment for the Cipher Bureau, and knew many details of the decryption technology.<ref>{{Harvnb|Kozaczuk|1984|pp=26, 212}}</ref> In Warsaw, under German occupation, other Cipher Bureau workers were interrogated by German intelligence commissions, and some AVA workers were approached by German agents, but all kept silent about compromises to Engima.<ref>{{Harvnb|Kozaczuk|1984|pp=212<U+2013>16}}</ref>

==In popular culture==
In 1967 the Polish military historian [[W<U+0142>adys<U+0142>aw Kozaczuk]], in his book ''Bitwa o tajemnice'' (The Struggle for Secrets), first revealed that the German Enigma had been broken by Polish cryptologists before World War II. Kozaczuk's disclosure came seven years before [[F.W. Winterbotham]]'s ''The Ultra Secret'' (1974) changed conventional views of the history of the war.<ref>{{Harvnb|Kozaczuk|1984|p=xi}}</ref>

The 1979 Polish film ''[[Sekret Enigmy]]'' (The Enigma Secret)<ref>[http://imdb.com/title/tt0079878/]</ref> is a generally fair, if superficial, account of the Cipher Bureau's story.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}} Twenty-two years later, the 2001 Hollywood film ''[[Enigma (2001 film)|Enigma]]'' was criticized for its many historical inaccuracies, including omission of Poland's fundamental work in Enigma [[decryption]].<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/8158782.stm How Poles cracked Nazi Enigma secret], Laurence Peter, BBC News, 20 July 2009</ref>
