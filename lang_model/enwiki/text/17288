{{History of Korea}}

The '''Later Three Kingdoms of Korea''' (892 - 936) consisted of [[Silla]], [[Hubaekje]] ("Later [[Baekje]]"), and [[Taebong|Hugoguryeo]] ("Later [[Goguryeo]]"). The latter two were viewed as heirs to the earlier [[Three Kingdoms of Korea]], which had been united by Silla, even though Hugoguryeo has little to do with Goguryeo. This period arose out of national unrest during the reign of Queen [[Jinseong of Silla]], and usually refers to the era between the founding of [[Hubaekje]] by [[Gyeon Hwon]] to the time [[Goryeo]] unified the peninsula.<ref name="three kingdoms ekc">{{ko}} [http://100.nate.com/dicsearch/pentry.html?s=K&i=260575&v=43 Later three kingdom era] at Encyclopedia of Korean Culture</ref>

==Background==
In the 9th and 10th century, [[Silla]] was shook from the problems arising from its foundation of the "[[bone rank system]]", a rigid class system under which only those from an aristocratic background could be appointed in high office. The system was being abused as means for the ruling royal family to dominate politically and this caused much unrest in the latter days of Silla. The local gentry called ''[[hojok]]'' (hangul:<U+D638><U+C871>, hanja: <U+8C6A><U+65CF>), i.e. mid-level nobility or village chiefs, strengthened their power during this chaotic period by assembling armies of their own and independently centralizing their forces.<ref>''Korea through the Ages Vol. 1'' pp 99-103</ref> 
Dissention deepened more within the nobility after the death of [[King Hyegong]] as contention over royal succession intensified and power struggles were constant among the ''hojok''.  
Not only was the political atmosphere in shambles, the financial state of Silla was dire. Taxation was difficult without the nobles' cooperation. As a result, the tax burden fell heavily on the peasants and farmers, who consequently revolted in 889, the third year of [[Jinseong of Silla |Queen Jinseong]]'s reign. Numerous revolts and uprisings occurred during the following 100 years, breaking Silla down.<ref name="three kingdoms ekc"/>

==Hubaekje and Hugoguryeo==
As Silla started to crumble, [[Gyeon Hwon]], a former general of Silla, led rebel troops to seize the provincial capital of [[Gwangju|Mujinju]] (hangul:<U+BB34><U+C9C4><U+C8FC>, hanja:<U+6B66><U+73CD><U+5DDE>) in 892. He then conquered the southwest regions and in 900, Gyeon Hwon declared himself king of [[Hubaekje]] ("later Baekje"), a country to revive [[Baekje]]'s glory. He established his capital at Wansanju (hangul:<U+C644><U+C0B0><U+C8FC>, hanja:<U+5B8C><U+5C71><U+5DDE>), today's [[Jeonju]], and continued to expand the kingdom.<ref name="gyeon hwon doosan">{{ko}} [http://100.naver.com/100.nhn?docid=9401 Gyeon Hwon] at [[Doosan Encyclopedia]]</ref><ref name="three kingdoms ekc"/> 

[[Gung Ye]] from Silla is believed to come from a royal or noble background. He was a Buddhist monk but soon joined in the political uprisings, and became leader of many troops. He conquered much land and set up base in Myeongju (hangul:<U+BA85><U+C8FC>, hanja:<U+6E9F><U+5DDE>), today's [[Gangneung]] in 895 with the support of many regional leaders, including general [[Taejo of Goryeo|Wanggeon]]. In 901, Gung Ye founded [[Taebong|Hugoguryeo]] but changed the name to [[Taebong|Majin]] in 904, and moved the capital to [[Cheorwon]]. Another name change came in 911, when it became [[Taebong]]. <ref name="taebong doosan">{{ko}} [http://100.naver.com/100.nhn?docid=154547 Taebong] at [[Doosan Encyclopedia]] </ref><ref name="three kingdoms ekc"/>

==Unification of the later three kingdoms==
Although Hubaekje started out as the frontrunner in national strength thanks to its fertile plains and diplomatic ties with China, Hugoguryeo soon became the largest force in the new three kingdom era as it quickly expanded its territory to almost three quarters of the peninsula under [[Gung Ye]] and the general [[Taejo of Goryeo|Wanggeon]]. As time passed however, Gung Ye started to call himself the [[Maitreya Buddha]] and resort to despotism, causing him to be overthrown by Wanggeon in 918.<ref name="three kingdoms ekc"/><ref>''Korea through the Ages Vol. 1'' pp 110-113</ref> Wanggeon established a new dynasty called [[Goryeo]] and moved the capital to Songak (hangul:<U+C1A1><U+C545>, hanja:<U+677E><U+5DBD>) the following year, creating the new troika of Goryeo, Baekje and Silla. <ref>{{ko}} [http://100.naver.com/100.nhn?docid=154713 Goryeo Taejo] at [[Doosan Encyclopedia]] </ref> 

The three kingdoms were in a constant power struggle, although by this time Silla had weakened to a despondent state and did not pose a big threat to the other two nations. Hubaekje led with an offensive approach but Wanggeon of Goryeo placed more importance on diplomatic ties, which endeared themselves to Silla.<ref name="three kingdoms ekc"/> The conflict between Hubaekje and Goryeo was constant near the Silla territory, as both countries wanted to wield their power over the region. Hubaekje led by attacking [[Gyeongju]], the capital of Silla, in 927 and crushing the Goryeo army. <ref name="kta p113">''Korea through the Ages Vol. 1'' p113</ref> Goryeo retaliated by winning the battle at [[Gochang]] in 930 and reclaiming the territory of [[Gongju|Woongjin]] in 934.<ref name="three kingdoms ekc"/> 

In 935, [[Gyeongsun of Silla |King Gyeongsun]] of a very weakened Silla surrenders to Goryeo. During this time, inner power struggles within Hubaekje weaken the country already fatigued from warfare. Gyeon Hwon names his younger son Geumgang as heir, but his other sons join forces and rebel, placing Gyeon Hwon's eldest son [[Singeom]] on the throne and confining Gyeon Hwon to [[Geumsansa|Geumsan Temple]]. Gyeon Hwon later escapes to Goryeo and joins forces with Wanggeon's army to attack his own founded country. Hubaekje falls to Goryeo in 936 and the peninsula is reunified.<ref name="kta p113"/>
