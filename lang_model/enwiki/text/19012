The '''Papah<U+0101>naumoku<U+0101>kea Marine National Monument''' (aka Papah<U+0101>naumoku<U+0101>kea) is a [[World Heritage]] listed, [[U.S. National Monument]] encompassing {{convert|140000|sqmi|km2}} of ocean waters, including ten islands and atolls of the [[Northwestern Hawaiian Islands]], internationally recognized for both its cultural and natural values <!--Note: listed for [[World Heritage]] cultual criteria (iii)(vi)and natural criteria (viii)(ix)(x)-->as follows:

<blockquote>
"The area has deep cosmological and traditional significance for living [[Native Hawaiians|Native Hawaiian]] culture, as an ancestral environment, as an embodiment of the [[Hawaiian kinship|Hawaiian concept of kinship]] between people and the natural world, and as the place where it is believed that life originates and to where the spirits return after death. On two of the islands, [[Nihoa#Prehistoric_human_habitation|Nihoa]] and [[Necker Island (Northwestern Hawaiian Islands)|Makumanamana]], there are archaeological remains relating to pre-European settlement and use. Much of the monument is made up of [[Pelagic zone|pelagic]] and deepwater habitats, with notable features such as [[seamount]]s and submerged banks, extensive [[coral reef]]s and [[lagoon]]s. It is one of the largest [[marine protected area]]s (MPAs) in the world."<ref name="WorldHeritage01">[http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/1326 UNESCO's World Heritage listing for Papah<U+0101>naumoku<U+0101>kea] Accessed 1 August 2010</ref>
</blockquote>

The area was proclaimed the '''Northwestern Hawaiian Islands Marine National Monument''' by [[President of the United States|U.S. President]] [[George W. Bush]] on June 15, 2006; it was renamed [[Papah<U+0101>naumoku<U+0101>kea]] in 2007, and inscribed on the World Heritage list as [[Papah<U+0101>naumoku<U+0101>kea]] on 30 July 2010, at the 34th Session of the World Heritage Committee, [[Brasilia]].<ref name="World Heritage Committee">

The area is managed in partnership with the [[Department of Commerce]], the [[Department of the Interior]], and the [[State of Hawaii]]. The name for the area was inspired by the names of the Hawaiian creator goddess [[Papahanaumoku]] and her husband [[Wakea]].

Although it is not a sanctuary, the ocean area is part of a system of 13 [[United States National Marine Sanctuary|National Marine Sanctuaries]] administered by the [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]] (NOAA).

The genesis of the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands (NWHI) as a protected area began on February 3, 1909, when U.S. President [[Theodore Roosevelt]] created the Hawaiian Islands Reservation through Executive Order 1019, as a response to the over-harvesting of seabirds, and in recognition of the importance of the NWHI as seabird nesting sites.<ref>{{Cite journal

President [[Bill Clinton]] established the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands Coral Reef Ecosystem Reserve on December 4, 2000, with [[wikisource:Executive Order 13178|Executive Order 13178]].  Clinton's executive order initiated a process to designate the waters of the NWHI as a [[Marine Protected Area|National Marine Sanctuary]]. A public comment period began in 2002.
