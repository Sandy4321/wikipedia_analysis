The '''Golden Ambrosian Republic''' ([[Italian language|Italian]]: ''Aurea Repubblica Ambrosiana''; [[1447]]&ndash;[[1450]]) was a short-lived government founded in [[Milan]] by members of the University of Pavia with popular support.  With the aid of [[Francesco Sforza]] they held out against the forces of [[Venice]], but after a betrayal Sforza defected and captured Milan to become Duke himself, abolishing the Republic.

==History==
===Foundation===
When [[Filippo Maria Visconti]], [[Visconti]] Duke of Milan, died on the 13th of August, 1447, the city was thrown into confusion by the unexpectedness of the Duke's expiration and the quick way in which the claimants to the title acted.  Filippo Maria had no heir through male bloodlines, but the day before his death had written a will dedicating the Duchy to [[Alfonso V of Aragon]].<ref>{{harvnb|Ady|1907|pp=36-37}}</ref>  Among the other claimants were [[Charles, Duke of Orl<U+00E9>ans]], nephew of Filippo Maria through his mother [[Valentina Visconti]], Filippo's cousins [[Albert VI, Archduke of Austria|Albert]] and [[Sigismund, Archduke of Austria|Sigismund]] of the [[House of Hapsburg]], great-grandsons of [[Bernab<U+00F2> Visconti]], and [[Frederick III, Holy Roman Emperor]], who declared that the Duchy reverted back to the [[Holy Roman Empire]] on the extinction of male heirs.<ref>{{harvnb|Ady|1907|pp=35-36}}</ref>  But the two most prominent candidates supported by the Milanese population were Alfonso of Aragon and [[Francesco Sforza]], the Duke's son-in-law by marrying [[Bianca Maria Visconti]].  The Bracceschi, supporters of the King of Aragon, seized the Castello on the night of the 13th, almost before Filippo Maria died, forcing the captains to swear allegiance to Alfonso.<ref>{{harvnb|Ady|1907|p=36}}</ref>

Despite the general support for either Alfonso or Sforza, other influential citizens believed that the old republic could be restored.  Learned bodies, such as the College of Jurisprudence in Pavia, painted the days of the old republic as a golden age.<ref>{{harvnb|Ady|1907|p=36}}</ref>  The merchants, seeing the prosperity of Republican Venice, were behind this idea.<ref>{{harvnb|Ady|1907|p=36}}</ref>  On the morning of the 14th, Republicans stirred the populace to rise against the Bracceschi, led by [[Antonio Trivulzio]], [[Giorgio Lampugnano]], [[Innocenzo Cotta]], and [[Teodoro Bossi]], members of the College of Jurisprudence.<ref>{{harvnb|Ady|1907|p=37}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Storia di Milano|2008}}, entry for 14 August, 1447</ref>  A Republic was declared behind the Palace of the Commune, and the captains abandoned their oaths to Alfonso but turned in favor of the Republic.  The Braccheschi were driven from Milan, and the new republic was called the Golden Ambrosian Republic, named for St. [[Ambrose]]<ref>Flag Recorded in: A. Ziggioto, "Della bandiera crociata", 1997  -  "La provincia di Milano e i suoi Comuni. Gli stemmi e la storia, 2003"</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Ady|1907|p=37}}</ref>, the [[4th century]] [[bishop of Milan]], who was taken on as the Republic's patron.  They took the old consitution and revised it that same day as suited their needs, electing twenty-four ''Capitani e difensori della libert<U+00E0>'', or "[[Ambrosian Republic#First capitani e defensori|Captains and Defenders of Liberty]]," to frame laws, elected regularly and later reduced to twelve.<ref>{{harvnb|Ady|1907|p=38}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Storia di Milano|2008}}, entry for 18 August, 1447</ref>

===Early existence===
[[Image:Francsesco Sforza.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Francesco Sforza]]The idea of a radical renovation of liberties in the cities did not suit the powers of North [[Italy]], who had been in league against the Visconti territorial gains in a decades-long series of wars interrupted by truces, most recently the [[Peace of Cremona]] of [[20 November]] [[1441]].  Venice was already at war with Milan, and the Republic was struck a sore blow as previously Milanese cities including [[Pavia]], [[Lodi]], and [[Piacenza]] defected or declared their independence.<ref>{{harvnb|Ady|1907|pp=38-39}}</ref>  Besides the loss of support and defensive locations, the drop in revenue also caused a brief financial crisis resolved by the imposition of new taxes.<ref>{{harvnb|Ady|1907|p=39}}</ref>  Venice, now occupying Lodi and Piacenza, refused to listen to Milan's pleas for peace.  Milan turned to Francesco Sforza, the greatest military leader of his day, offering him the position of Captain-General and the city of [[Brescia]].  Although he wished to succeed Sforza, he decided to accept the position and promised rewards.<ref>{{harvnb|Ady|1907|p=40}}</ref>  A draft was declared in Milan on the 13th of September.<ref>{{harvnb|Ady|1907|p=40}}</ref>

Sforza quickly captured independent [[Pavia]] when its commander offered to surrender to him, and the Republic grudgingly allowed him to keep it with the title of Count, fearing that the Pavians and their large arsenal might instead offer themselves to Venice if they refused.<ref>{{harvnb|Ady|1907|p=41}}</ref>  Sforza promised the Pavians no new taxes, respect for the old laws, payment for his hired officials, and to repair the city bridges and walls.  He kept these promises faithfully and so won over the people of Pavia, establishing his rulership.  Pavia was previously almost a second capital to Milan, and gave Sforza his own seat of power. The city was also in a strategic location on the [[Po River]], situated where it could block the Venetians from coming to the relief of the beleaguered Piacenza via water.  Returning to this siege and finding the city not likely to crumble by starvation, he resolved to storm it.  Employing cannons in an almost unheard-of manner, he opened up a breach in the walls and sacked the city.<ref>{{harvnb|Ady|1907|p=42}}</ref>  The news of this sack was greeted by three days' rejoicing in Milan.  Meanwhile, Milanese Captain [[Bartolomeo Colleoni]] captured [[Tortona]] which had previously proclaimed Sforza as its lord, stealing it from the now dangerously powerful Sforza.  This caused further and even greater rejoicing, for the Milanese feared Sforza.<ref>{{harvnb|Ady|1907|p=43}}</ref>

January, [[1448]] came, and the terms of the previous Captains and Defenders ended, and in the following election the [[Guelphs and Ghibellines|Guelphs]] rose to political prominence.<ref>{{harvnb|Ady|1907|p=43}}</ref>  Being especially adverse toward Sforza, they entered into negotiations for peace with Venice, which, also faced with Sforza's threat, was willing to come to terms, albeit dictated by herself.  Two of the Ghibellines who helped to found the Republic, namely Lampugnano and Bossi, stirred the populace against them in a massive demonstration before the Court of Arengo.  The Council of Nine Hundred was forced to abandon its plans for peace, and Sforza was given the go-ahead for his next campaign to seize the [[Adda River]].<ref>{{harvnb|Ady|1907|p=43}}</ref>  Sforza schemes were voted down by the Republic in favor of more traditional tactics, namely besieging [[Lodi]] directly.<ref>{{harvnb|Ady|1907|p=44}}</ref>  While this happened, the Venetian fleet under Andrea Quirini assaulted the bridge of [[Cremona]].  However, Sforza's wife Bianca was there, and led the defense until he relieved the city.  The Venetian fleet withdrew and entrenched while it waited for the arrival of the Venetian army.<ref>{{harvnb|Ady|1907|pp=44-45}}</ref>  Sforza trapped the fleet behind its defenses and, with his unorthadox use of artillery, utterly destroyed or captured every one of the seventy ships.  This victory was celebrated in Milan, but the leaders of the Republic still feared Sforza, and sent him off to occupy him with the Ghiarad'adda while Lodi and [[Caravaggio, Italy|Caravaggio]] were besieged, hoping that their fall would end the war.<ref>{{harvnb|Ady|1907|p=45}}</ref>

But ultimately the forces were brought together at Caravaggio, and both Sforza's Milanese and the Venetian army under [[Micheletto Attendolo]] gathered there.  The siege remained unbroken throughout July and until the 15th of September, when Attendolo launched a surprise-attack on Sforza, so rapid that he did not even have time to buckle on his armor.  What might have been a route Sforza turned into a [[Battle of Caravaggio|great victory]] as he set the example for his troops on the front line and utterly defeated the Venetian army, capturing three generals.<ref>{{harvnb|Ady|1907|p=46}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Storia di Milano|2008}}, entry for 15 September, 1448</ref>  Caravaggio fell, and despite rejoicing in Milan, little gratitude was given by the government to the architect of the victory, and the Republic sent him on to Lodi, determined to end the war.<ref>{{harvnb|Ady|1907|p=46}}</ref>  It was here, at the time when a satisfactory end to the war seemed evident, that the Milanese took a fatal misstep.

===Sforza's defection and the Guelph-Ghibelline feud===
In Milan, Sforza's enemies worked continually against him.  The Piccinini brothers, sons of famous condottiere [[Niccol<U+00F2> Piccinino]] and Captains-General before being replaced as supreme military commanders by Sforza, convinced the suspicious Republic to work secretly against Sforza.<ref>{{harvnb|Ady|1907|p=46}}</ref>  Rumors were spread among the troops about not receiving payment at the end of the war if they remained with Sforza, and Sforza himself was ordered back from the siege of [[Brescia]], the city promised him, while the citizens were secretly told to hold out until peace, already in the works, was signed.<ref>{{harvnb|Ady|1907|pp=46-47}}</ref>  Sforza learned of this treachery and defected to the Venetians for 13,000 ducats and the Duchy of Milan in return for the Ghiarad'adda, [[Crema]], and his service.  The treaty was signed on the 18th of October, 1448,<ref>{{harvnb|Ady|1907|p=47}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Storia di Milano|2008}}, entry for 18 October, 1448</ref> and Sforza now undid everything he had labored for over the past year.  With such a powerful man on the Venetian side, it was the beginning of the end of the Golden Ambrosian Republic.  Public opinion, despite the government's position, was generally pro-Sforza, and only an impassioned, patriotic speech from Giorgio Lampugnano subdued it at last.  The Piccinini brothers became Captains-General once more, but were not as capable as the brilliant Sforza.<ref>{{harvnb|Storia di Milano|2008}}, entry for 14 November, 1448</ref>

[[Image:5022 - Milano - Broletto nuovo - Foto Giovanni Dall'Orto, 24-July-2007.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The piazza of the [[Broletto]], where the heads of slain Ghibellines were raised.]]This was reinforced by the internal dissention that was prominent in Milan.  Crime and mob violence were rampant, and the harsh but empty measures against it only served to further divide the populace.  Members of the government were filled with suspicion against one another.  In an attempt to resolve the situation, the [[podest<U+00E0>]] was given absolute power.<ref>{{harvnb|Ady|1907|p=49}}</ref>  Financial problems were also grave; fines, confiscations, and a state lottery were instituted to try and alleviate the deficit.<ref>{{harvnb|Ady|1907|p=49}}</ref>  Moreover, Guelphic aristocrats continued to be regularly elected over the Ghibellines, and began to make the Republic far less democratic.  [[Carlo Gonzaga of Milan|Carlo Gonzaga]], Captain of the People, lived luxiuriously as an autocrat with his will as law.  He was supported by Giovanni Appiani and Giovanni Ossona, tradesmen-turned-politicians, who were prominent in government affairs.<ref>{{harvnb|Ady|1907|p=50}}</ref>  Gonzaga began replacing his officials with unambitious men in his favor, and the Ghibellines saw their ideal of the Republic crumbling before there eyes.  Lampugnano and his Ghibelline friends conspired against Gonzaga and the Guelphic regime, but were exposed by a letter intercepted by Gonzaga from Lampugnano to his friend Bossi.<ref>{{harvnb|Ady|1907|p=50}}</ref>  Gonzaga kept this knowledge secret, knowing that Lampugnano and Bossi were two of the most influential citizens since the formation of the Republic, but with the support of the vengeful Guelphic Captains and Defenders conspired to have them slain.  Lampugnano and Bossi were sent as envoys to Frederick III in February of 1449, but on the road were caught and imprisoned.  Lampugnano was beheaded without a trial, and Bossi was tortured until he gave the names of his fellow conspirators.<ref>{{harvnb|Ady|1907|p=51}}</ref>  Following the execution of the leaders there was a massacre of leading Ghibellines within the city, from which only a few, such as [[Vitaliano Borromeo]], escaped to safety in [[Arona]] and elsewhere.<ref>{{harvnb|Storia di Milano|2008}}, entry for January, 1449</ref>  The heads of the slain were placed upon pikes in the Piazza of the Broletto.<ref>{{harvnb|Ady|1907|p=49}}</ref>

Meanwhile, the previous claimants to the Duchy began to see that Sforza would be a threat greater than the Ambrosian Republic.  [[Louis, Duke of Savoy|Louis]] the Duke of [[Savoy]] invaded in spring of 1449, and Sforza sent Colleoni (who had earlier defected) to defeat him at [[Borgomanero]], leading to an uneasy peace.<ref>{{harvnb|Ady|1907|pp=53-54}}</ref>  Sforza also faced treachery within his own ranks, added with the fact that he rashly accepted the defection of his great enemies the Piccinini brothers, who, upon gaining access to Monza, promptly returned it to Milan.<ref>{{harvnb|Ady|1907|pp=54-55}}</ref>

Lampugnano, unfortunately for the Guelphs, was considered a martyr for the Republic.  This was made worse by the fact that the Guelphs in leadership refused to run elections in April, until in June they were forced by the populace.<ref>{{harvnb|Ady|1907|p=52}}</ref>  Ghibeline families took the reins of Milan in this election, and the Guelphs were defeated.<ref>{{harvnb|Ady|1907|p=52}}</ref>  However, the reprivals against the Guelphs, including the imprisonment of Appiani and Ossona who had been blamed (probably unjustly) for the massacre, led the populace to violently depose the Ghibellines and reinstall the extremist Guelphs.<ref>{{harvnb|Ady|1907|p=53}}</ref>  Gonzaga, however, whose friend Galeotto Toscano was a fatal casualty of the uprising, departed Milan to Crema, hoping to make peace with Sforza.<ref>{{harvnb|Ady|1907|p=53}}</ref>

===End of the Republic===
Sforza was coming close to Milan itself in his conquests, and decided that since it was too powerful to be taken by force, he would surround it and starve the populace into surrender.  With the loss of the outer cities by conquest or defection, Milan underwent famine.<ref>{{harvnb|Ady|1907|p=55}}</ref>  Gonzaga offered Crema to Sforza, hoping he would be tempted to take it himself and betray the Venetians.  But Sforza remained staunch, and instead offered Gonzaga the city of [[Tortona]] if he would abandon Crema.  This was accepted, and Crema, without support, quickly capitulated.<ref>{{harvnb|Ady|1907|pp=55-56}}</ref>[[Image:Vessillo della Repubblica Ambrosiana (1447-1450).jpg|thumb|right|225px|A flag made for the Golden Ambrosian Republic, showing St. Ambrose surrounded by the virtues.]]

To the Milanese, Sforza's victory now seemed certain, but he found his Venetian allies beginning to have doubts about their Captain-General.  They decided that a Milan run by Sforza would be far more dangerous and detrimental to their interests than if it were run by a weak Republic.  The last of the territory claimed by Venice, namely Crema, was now captured.  Venice went behind Sforza's back and signed a peace treaty with the Republic.  They conceded conquered land to the Republic in return for peace, and let Sforza keep only Pavia, Cremona, Piacenza, and a narrow strip of land.<ref>{{harvnb|Ady|1907|p=56}}</ref>  They ordered him to accept the treaty or find Venice his enemy.<ref>{{harvnb|Ady|1907|p=56}}</ref>  The Republic rejoiced, and the citizens were confident the war was over and their future was secured.<ref>{{harvnb|Ady|1907|pp=56-57}}</ref>  But Sforza could not accept the conditions of the treaty, and decided to persevere in the struggle.  He was already very powerful, and moreover was close to Milan.  The Milanese in their assurance of peace had nearly exhausted their resources to plant crops and return to the old way of life.<ref>{{harvnb|Ady|1907|p=57}}</ref>  He was confident that Milan would quickly fall to him.  After reinforcing his peace with Savoy with the concession of a few unimportant castles, he defeated the Venetians under his rival [[Sigismondo Pandolfo Malatesta|Sigismondo Malatesta]] and continued the siege.<ref>{{harvnb|Ady|1907|p=57}}</ref>

Sforza chose for his headquarters the Borromeo castle of [[Peschiera Borromeo|Peschiera]], south-east of the city.<ref>{{it icon}} [http://www.peschieraborromeo.com/ Comune di Peschiera Borromeo] (Community website.  See under ''Il Castello'' at lower right, then ''L'interno del Castello'').  Accessed June 11, 2008.</ref>  Starvation and suffering were rampant in Milan.  At last [[Gaspare da Vimercate]] engineered a coup on the 24th of February, [[1450]].<ref>{{harvnb|Ady|1907|p=58}}</ref>  The next day the citizens met, but the suggestions and opinions were of great variety, save that all condemned Venice for its apparent apathy.  Da Vimercate convinced the people to surrender to Sforza.<ref>{{harvnb|Ady|1907|p=59}}</ref>  Sforza had made himself very popular for his generosity while on fighting for Milan.  He had abstained from ravaging the countryside as was so common among commanders of his day, and after some debate the public was convinced.  The following day terms were offered to Sforza, who accepted them.  Sforza earned the devotion of the people by distributing food to the starving people.<ref>{{harvnb|Ady|1907|p=60}}</ref>  On March 22, 1450, he had himself declared ''[[capitano del popolo]]'', and by right of his wife, the [[Duke of Milan]].<ref>{{harvnb|Ady|1907|p=60}}</ref>  He secured his popular support by letting many office-holders keep their positions and being very lenient in his reprisals.  The leaders were briefly imprisoned or relegated to their estates, but were generally pardoned soon after, even knighting some of his old enemies at his coronation.<ref>{{harvnb|Ady|1907|p=65}}</ref>  Ghibellines were allowed to return in safety and were restored to favor.<ref>{{harvnb|Ady|1907|p=65}}, note Ghibelline families mentioned</ref>

===Aftermath===
Sforza remained at war with Venice for years after the downfall of the Ambrosian Republic.  Venice allied herself with the [[kingdom of Naples]], previously a contender for the succession of Milan.  Sforza, however, allied himself with [[Medici]] [[Florence]] and his friend [[Cosimo de' Medici]] against Venice and [[Crown of Aragon|Aragonese]] Naples. The continued war was finally closed by the [[peace of Lodi]] in [[1454]] with the [[House of Sforza]] as the established rulers of the [[Duchy of Milan]]<ref>Veneto.org ''[http://www.veneto.org/history/serenissima3.htm Venice Republic: Renaissance]''.  Accessed June 11, 2008.</ref>

During its three-year existence, the Ambrosian Republic won two major battles. The [[Lombardy|Lombards]] defeated the [[France|French]] at the [[Battle of Bosco Marengo]] in 1447 <ref>A. Mary F. Robinson: The English Historical Review, Vol. 3, No. 9</ref> and the [[Venetian Republic|Venetians]] at the [[Battle of Caravaggio]] in 1448. It was those victories that ensured the Republic all the territory of the former [[Duchy of Milan|Duchy]].

Of the Republic, [[Niccol<U+00F2> Machiavelli]] remarked "In order to create a Republic in Milan it would be necessary to exterminate all the nobility. . . . For there are, among the nobles, so many exalted personages (tanti stra<U+00AD> ordinari) that the laws do not suffice to repress them, and they must needs be kept under by a living voice and a royal power."<ref>Machiavelli, ''Discorso sulla riforma dello stato di Firenze''</ref>
