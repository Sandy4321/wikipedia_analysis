==History==
Equality Pennsylvania was founded in 1996 in Philadelphia as the Center for Lesbian and Gay Civil Rights <ref name= "Equality Pennsylvania About Us" />. Upon its founding, the Center provided legal services to members of the [[LGBT]] community in Philadelphia. The organization specifically provided assistance with HIV/AIDS discrimination and transgender name-change cases for the LGBT community. The organization eventually developed into Equality Advocates PA, which helped to advocate for LGBT rights along with its previous goal of providing legal representation to the LGBT community. Equality Advocates PA was instrumental in defeating constitutional amendments banning same-sex marriage in 2006 and 2008 <ref name= "Equality Pennsylvania About Us" />. In 2007, the organization also began to help draft [[Employment Non-Discrimination Act|LGBT non-discrimination legislation]] throughout the state. In 2009, the Equality Advocates PA reorganized under the name of Equality Pennsylvania. Along with changing the name of the organization, this reorganization saw the installation of a new board of directors and a new mission, which is to advocate for LGBT rights and LGBT legislation throughout Pennsylvania as a [[501(c)(4)]] organization. The organization also reassigned its legal responsibilities to the [[Mazzoni Center]] to ensure that it could offer its complete focus to advocating for equality for LGBT individuals. In 2010, the organization hired Ted Martin to become the Executive Director and opened an office in [[Harrisburg, Pennsylvania]] to help expand the focus of the organization beyond Philadelphia and to allow for easier access to the General Assembly and the Governor.
