A '''hybrid electric vehicle''' (HEV) combines a conventional [[internal combustion engine]] [[ground propulsion|propulsion]] system with an [[Electric power|electric]] propulsion system. The presence of the electric powertrain is intended to achieve either better [[fuel economy in automobiles|fuel economy]] than a [[conventional vehicle]], or better performance. A variety of types of HEV exist, and the degree to which they function as EVs varies as well. The most common form of HEV is the hybrid electric car, although hybrid electric trucks (pickups and tractors) also exist.

Modern HEVs make use of efficiency-improving technologies such as [[regenerative braking]], which converts the vehicle's kinetic energy into battery-replenishing electric energy, rather than wasting it as heat energy as conventional brakes do. Some varieties of HEVs use their internal combustion engine to generate electricity by spinning an [[electrical generator]] (this combination is known as a [[motor-generator]]), to either recharge their batteries or to directly power the electric drive motors. Many HEVs [[Idle reduction|reduce idle emissions]] by [[wikt:shut down|shutting down]] the ICE at [[wikt:idle|idle]] and restarting it when needed; this is known as a [[start-stop system]]. A hybrid-electric produces less emissions from its ICE than a comparably-sized gasoline car, as an HEV's gasoline engine is usually smaller than a pure [[fossil-fuel vehicle]], and if not used to directly drive the car, can be geared to run at maximum efficiency, further improving fuel economy.

The hybrid-electric vehicle did not become widely available until the release of the [[Toyota Prius]] in Japan in 1997, followed by the [[Honda Insight]] in 1999. While initially perceived as unnecessary due to the low cost of gasoline, worldwide increases in the price of petroleum caused many [[automaker]]s to release hybrids in the late 2000s; they are now perceived as a core segment of the [[automotive market]] of the future.<ref>http://www.autonews.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20070416/REG/70416014/-1</ref><ref>[http://www.wfs.org/futcontja07.htm WFS Energy Diversity as a Business Imperative]</ref> Worldwide sales of hybrid vehicles produced by [[Toyota]] reached 1.0 million vehicles by May 31, 2007, and the 2.0 million mark was reached by August 31, 2009, with hybrids sold in 50 countries.<ref name=KBB1009>{{cite web|url=http://www.kbb.com/kbb/green-cars/articles.aspx?BlogPostId=1664|title=Toyota Global Hybrid Sales Top Two Million Mark|publisher=[[Kelly Blue Book]] Green|accessdate=2009-10-24}}</ref><ref name=Toyota0909>{{cite web|url=http://green.autoblog.com/2009/09/04/toyota-tops-2-million-hybrid-sales-worldwide/|title=Toyota tops 2 million hybrid sales worldwide|publisher=AutobloGreen|date=2009-09-04|accessdate=2009-10-24}}</ref> Worldwide sales are led by the Prius, with cumulative sales of 1.43 million by Augut 2009.<ref name=KBB1009/> The second-generation Honda Insight was the top-selling vehicle in Japan in April 2009, marking the first occasion that an HEV has received the distinction.<ref>http://www.detnews.com/article/20090511/AUTO01/905110379/1148/?source=nletter-business</ref> American automakers have made development of hybrid cars a top priority.<ref>http://www.calcars.org/calcars-news/1052.html</ref>

== History ==
{{See|History of plug-in hybrids}}
In 1901, while employed at Lohner Coach Factory, [[Ferdinand Porsche]] designed the ''[[Lohner-Porsche Mixte Hybrid|Mixte]]'', a 4WD series-hybrid version of "''System Lohner-Porsche''" electric carriage previously appeared in 1900 Paris Salon. The Mixte included a pair of generators driven by 2.5-hp Daimler IC engines to extend operating range.<ref>[http://www.nowpublic.com/tech-biz/hybrid-car-history-porsche-4wd-1900 HYBRID CAR HISTORY PORSCHE 4WD 1900]</ref><ref>[http://www.greenhybrid.com/wiki/index.php/Hybrid_History_-_Part_1 Hybrid History - Part 1]</ref> The Mixte broke several Austrian speed records, and also won the [[Exelberg Rally]] in 1901 with Porsche himself driving. The Mixte used a [[internal combustion engine|gasoline engine]] powering a [[Electrical generator|generator]], which in turn powered electric [[hub motor]]s, with a small battery pack for reliability. It had a range of 50&nbsp;km, a top speed of 50&nbsp;km/h and a power of 5.22&nbsp;kW during 20 minutes.

In 1905, H. Piper filed a US patent application for a hybrid vehicle.<ref name="Victor Wouk p70-74">Victor Wouk, Hybrid Electric Vehicles, Scientific American, 1997-10, p70-74</ref>

The 1915 ''Dual Power'', made by the [[Woods Motor Vehicle]] electric car maker, had a four-cylinder ICE and an electric motor. Below 15&nbsp;mph (25&nbsp;km/h) the electric motor alone drove the vehicle, drawing power from a battery pack, and above this speed the "main" engine cut in to take the car up to its 35&nbsp;mph (55&nbsp;km/h) top speed. About 600 were made up to 1918.<ref name=Beaulieu>{{cite book |last=Georgano |first=N. |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Beaulieu Encyclopedia of the Automobile |year=2000 |publisher=HMSO |location=London |isbn=1-57958-293-1}}</ref>

The first gasoline-electric hybrid car was released by the [[Woods Motor Vehicle|Woods Motor Vehicle Company of Chicago]] in 1917. The hybrid was a commercial failure, proving to be too slow for its price, and too difficult to service. 

In 1931 Erich Gaichen invented and drove from Altenburg to Berlin a 1/2 horsepower electric car containing features later incorporated into hybrid cars.  Its maximum speed was {{convert|25|mi/h|km/h}}, but it was licensed by the Motor Transport Office, taxed by the German Revenue Department and patented by the German Reichs-Patent Amt.  The car battery was re-charged by the motor when the car went downhill.  Additional power to charge the battery was provided by a cylinder of compressed air which was re-charged by small air pumps activated by vibrations of the chassis and the brakes and by igniting oxyhydrogen gas.  An account of the car and his characterization as a "crank inventor" can be found in Arthur Koestler's autobiography, Arrow in the Blue, pages 269-271, which summarize a contemporaneous newspaper account written by Koestler.  No production beyond the prototype was reported.

===Predecessors of current technology===
A more recent working prototype of the HEV was built by [[Victor Wouk]] (one of the scientists involved with the [[Henney Kilowatt]], the first transistor-based electric car).  Wouk's work with HEVs in the 1960s and 1970s earned him the title as the "Godfather of the Hybrid".<ref>{{cite web|title=Godfather of the Hybrid|publisher=California Institute of Technology|work=Engineering & Science|url=http://pr.caltech.edu/periodicals/EandS/articles/LXVII3/wouk.html|accessdate=2006-01-11}}</ref>  Wouk installed a prototype hybrid drivetrain (with a {{convert|16|kW|0|lk=on}} [[electric motor]]) into a 1972 [[Buick Skylark]] provided by GM for the 1970 Federal Clean Car Incentive Program, but the program was stopped by the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) in 1976 while Eric Stork, the head of the EPA at the time, was accused of a [[prejudicial]] [[coverup]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hybridcars.com/epa-numbers/hybrids-and-the-epa-fuel-economy-controversy.html|title=The Great Hybrid Car Cover-up of '74|publisher=hybridCARS.com|accessdate=2006-10-12}}</ref> 

The [[regenerative brake|regenerative braking system]], the core design concept of most production HEVs, was developed by [[electrical engineer]] [[David Arthurs]] around 1978, using [[wikt:off-the shelf|off-the shelf]] components and an [[Opel GT]].  However the [[voltage controller]] to link the batteries, motor (a jet-engine starter motor), and DC [[electrical generator|generator]] was Arthurs'.  The vehicle exhibited {{convert|75|mpgus|lk=off}} [[fuel efficiency]], and plans for it (as well as somewhat updated versions) are still available through the [[Mother Earth News]] web site.  The Mother Earth News' own 1980 version claimed nearly {{convert|84|mpgus|lk=off}}.

In 1989, [[Audi AG|Audi]] produced its first [[wikt:iteration|iteration]] of the Audi Duo (the [[Audi 100#C3|Audi C3 100 Avant Duo]]) experimental vehicle, a [[plug-in hybrid|plug-in parallel hybrid]] based on the [[Audi 100]] Avant [[quattro (four wheel drive system)|quattro]].  This car had a {{convert|9.4|kW|PS bhp|1|lk=on}} [[Siemens]] [[electric motor]] which drove the rear roadwheels.  A [[trunk]]-mounted [[nickel-cadmium battery]] supplied [[energy]] to the motor that drove the rear wheels.  The vehicle's front roadwheels were powered by a [[list of discontinued Volkswagen Group petrol engines#NF|2.3&nbsp;litre]] [[straight-five engine|five-cylinder]] [[petrol engine]] with an output of {{convert|100|kW|PS bhp|0}}.  The intent was to produce a vehicle which could operate on the engine in the country, and electric mode in the city.  Mode of operation could be selected by the driver.  Just ten vehicles are believed to have been made; one [[drawback]] was that due to the extra weight of the electric drive, the vehicles were less efficient when running on their engines alone than standard Audi 100s with the same engine.

Two years later, Audi, unveiled the second duo generation, the [[Audi 100#Audi Duo|Audi 100 Duo]] - likewise based on the Audi 100 Avant quattro.  Once again, this featured an electric motor, a {{convert|21.3|kW|PS bhp|1}} three-phase machine, driving the rear roadwheels.  This time, however, the rear wheels were additionally powered via the [[Torsen]] centre [[differential (mechanical device)|differential]] from the main engine compartment, which housed a 2.0&nbsp;litre [[inline-four engine|four-cylinder engine]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}<!-- I think this might be the 2.0 five cylinder engine, rather than the 4cyl -->  {{See also|Audi hybrid vehicles}}

The [[Bill Clinton]] administration initiated the [[Partnership for a New Generation of Vehicles]] (PNGV) program on 29 September 1993, that involved [[Chrysler]], [[Ford]], [[General Motors]], [[USCAR]], the [[DoE]], and other various governmental agencies to engineer the next efficient and clean vehicle.<ref>{{cite web|author=Sissine, Fred|year=1996|title=CRS Report for Congress: The Partnership for a New Generation of Vehicles (PNGV)|work=National Library for the Environment|url=http://www.ncseonline.org/NLE/CRSreports/energy/eng-9.cfm|accessdate=11 January 2006}}</ref>  The [[United States National Research Council]] (USNRC) cited [[automotive industry|automakers]]' moves to produce HEVs as evidence that technologies developed under PNGV were being rapidly adopted on [[production line]]s, as called for under Goal 2.  Based on information received from automakers, NRC reviewers questioned whether the "Big Three" would be able to move from the concept phase to cost effective, pre-production [[prototype]] vehicles by 2004, as set out in Goal 3.<ref>Review of the Research Program of the Partnership for a New Generation of Vehicles: Seventh Report, National Research Council, (2001), p. 77</ref>  The program was replaced by the hydrogen-focused [[FreedomCAR]] initiative by the [[George W.

Automotive hybrid technology became successful in the 1990s when the [[Honda Insight]] and [[Toyota Prius]] became available. These vehicles have a mechanical linkage from the ICE to the driven wheels, so that some power is transferred from the engine to the wheels without conversion to and from electric energy.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}

An [[R.L. Polk]] survey of 2003 [[model year]] cars showed that hybrid electric car registrations in the [[United States]] rose to 43,435 cars, a 25.8% increase from 2002 numbers.{{Citation needed|date=June 2007}} [[California]] had the most HEVs registered: 11,425.

The Prius has been in high demand since 2004. Newer designs have more conventional appearance and are less expensive, often appearing and performing identically to their non-hybrid counterparts while delivering 40% better fuel efficiency. The [[Honda Civic Hybrid]] appears identical to the non-hybrid version, for instance, but delivers better mileage. The redesigned 2004 Toyota Prius improved passenger room, cargo area, and power output, while increasing energy efficiency and reducing emissions. The Honda Insight, while not matching the demand of the Prius, stopped being produced after 2006 and has a devoted base of owners. In 2004, Honda also released a hybrid version of the [[Honda Accord|Accord]] but discontinued it in 2007 citing disappointing sales.<ref>{{cite web | title =Honda to discontinue hybrid Accord | work=MSNBC | url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/19049079/ | accessdate=April 19 | accessyear=2008}}</ref>

[[Hyundai Motor Company]] plans to start retail sales of its first [[LPG]]<U+2013>electric hybrid vehicle in July 2009. To be sold initially in the South Korean domestic market under the [[Avante]] badge, the [[Elantra]] LPI Hybrid Electric Vehicle (HEV) is the world's first hybrid vehicle to be powered by liquid petroleum gas (LPG) and the first to adopt advanced [[Lithium Polymer]] (Li<U+2013>Poly) batteries.

Comparing operating costs among different types of hybrid vehicles currently available in the marketplace, the Elantra LPI HEV promises to be the cheapest of all to run. The Elantra LPI HEV promises to be as much as 40 percent cheaper to operate than other competitor models in the marketplace<ref>http://worldwide.hyundai-motor.com/common/html/about/news_event/press_read_2008_23.html</ref>

Honda will release the CR-Z in hybrid form in Feb 2010 in Japan.<ref> http://www.edmunds.com/insideline/do/News/articleId=152552</ref>

===Plug-in hybrids (PHEVs)===
{{See|Plug-in hybrid}}
A '''plug-in''' hybrid electric vehicle ('''PHEV''') is a hybrid vehicle with [[Battery (electricity)|batteries]] that can be recharged by connecting a plug to an [[electric power]] source. It shares the characteristics of both traditional hybrid electric vehicles (also called charge-maintaining hybrid electric vehicles <ref>http://www.seriouswheels.com/cars/top-2007-Riley-Enterprises-XR-3.htm</ref> or CHEV), having an electric motor and a [[internal combustion engine]], and of [[all-electric vehicle]]s, also having a [[plug]] to connect to the [[electric grid]]. 

In 2007 the [[United States Department of Energy]] recommended [[plug-in hybrid]] electric vehicles for [[mass-production]].

==Technology==
[[Image:Fuelcell.jpg|Configuration of components.|right|150px]]
The varieties of hybrid electric designs can be differentiated by the structure of the [[hybrid vehicle drivetrain]], the fuel type, and the mode of operation.

In 2007, several automobile manufacturers announced that future vehicles will use aspects of hybrid electric technology to reduce fuel consumption without the use of the hybrid drivetrain. Regenerative braking can be used to recapture energy and stored to power electrical accessories, such as air conditioning. Shutting down the engine at idle can also be used to reduce fuel consumption and reduce emissions without the addition of a hybrid drivetrain. In both cases, some of the advantages of hybrid electric technology are gained while additional cost and weight may be limited to the addition of larger batteries and starter motors. There is no standard terminology for such vehicles, although they may be termed [[mild hybrid]]s.

The 2000s saw development of [[plug-in hybrid electric vehicle]]s (PHEVs), which can be recharged from the [[electric power transmission|electrical power grid]] and do not require conventional fuel for short trips. The [[Renault Kangoo]] was the first production model of this design, released in France in 2003.

===Engines and fuel sources===
==== Fossil fuels ====
{{Main|Fossil fuel}}

[[Free-piston engine]]s could be used to generate electricity as efficiently as, and less expensively than, fuel cells <ref>http://www.technologyreview.com/Energy/21442/?nlid=1374</ref>.

;Gasoline
[[Gasoline engine]]s are used in most hybrid electric designs, and will likely remain dominant for the foreseeable future. While [[petroleum]]-derived gasoline is the primary fuel, it is possible to mix in varying levels of ethanol created from [[renewable energy]] sources. Like most modern ICE-powered vehicles, HEVs can typically use up to about 15% [[bioethanol]]. Manufacturers may move to [[flexible fuel engine]]s, which would increase allowable ratios, but no plans are in place at present.

;Diesel
[[Diesel-electric]]  HEVs use a [[diesel engine]] for power generation. Diesels have advantages when delivering constant power for long periods of time, suffering less wear while operating at higher efficiency. The diesel engine's high torque, combined with hybrid technology, may offer substantially improved mileage. Most diesel vehicles can use 100% pure [[biofuel]]s ([[biodiesel]]), so they can use but do not need [[petroleum]] at all for fuel (although mixes of biofuel and petroleum are more common, and petroleum may be needed for [[lubrication]]). If diesel-electric HEVs were in use, this benefit would likely also apply. Diesel-electric hybrid drivetrains have begun to appear in commercial vehicles (particularly buses); as of 2007, no light duty diesel-electric hybrid passenger cars are currently available, although prototypes exist. Peugeot is expected to produce a diesel-electric hybrid version of its 308 in late 2008 for the European market.<ref>http://www.autoexpress.co.uk/news/autoexpressnews/207600/peugeot_308.html Autoexpress on diesel-electric Peugeot 308</ref>

;Hydrogen
Hydrogen fuel cells create electricity which is fed into an electric motor that drives the wheels. Adding [[regenerative breaking]] to increase efficiency is a no-brainer so all modern Hydrogen fuel cell vehicles are hybrids.

==== Biofuels ====
{{Main|biofuel|flexifuel vehicle|}}

Hybrid vehicles might use an [[internal combustion engine]] running on [[biofuel]]s, such as [[ethanol fuel]] or [[biodiesel]]. The [[Chevrolet Volt]] [[plug-in hybrid electric vehicle]] would be the first commercially available [[flexible-fuel vehicle|flex-fuel]] [[plug-in hybrid]] capable of adapting the propulsion to the biofuels used in several world markets such as the ethanol blend [[E85]] in the US, or [[Common ethanol fuel mixtures#E100|E100]] in Brazil, or biodiesel in Sweden.<ref name="GMVoltFlex">{{cite web |url=http://www.prdomain.com/companies/G/GeneralMotors/newsreleases/20071838357.htm|publisher=General Motors |title=Chevrolet Volt-GM's concept electric vehicle could eliminate trips to the gas station |date=2007-01-07|accessdate=2009-04-02 |language= }}</ref><ref name="Green0107">{{cite web|url=http://www.greencar.com/articles/gm-chevrolet-volt-plug-hybrid-electric-vehicle.php|title=GM Chevrolet Volt Plug-In Hybrid Electric Vehicle|author=Kellen Schefter|publisher=GreenCar|date=2007-01-10|accessdate=2009-04-02}}</ref>

===Electric machines===
In split path vehicles (Toyota, Ford, GM, Chysler) there are two electical machines, one of which functions as a motor primarily, and the second functions as a generator primarily. One of the primary requirements of these machines is that they are very efficient, as the electrical portion of the energy must be converted from the engine to the generator, through two inverters, through the motor again and then to the wheels. Therefore, any efficiency losses in the electric machines and inverters have a multiplication effect on the efficiency of the system.

Most of the electric machines used in hybrid vehicles are brushless DC motors (BLDC). Specifically, they are of a type called an interior permanent magnet (IPM) machine (or motor). These machines are wound similarly to induction machines found in a typical home, but use very strong rare earth magnets in the rotor. These magnets contain neodymium, iron and boron, and are therefore called NdFeB magnets. The magnet material is extremely expensive, and its cost is one of the limiting factors in the use of these machines.

The use of strong permanent magnets allows these machines to operate with very high efficiency, as is required in hybrid electric vehicles.

===Design considerations===
In some cases, manufacturers are producing HEVs that use the added energy provided by the hybrid systems to give vehicles a power boost, rather than significantly improved fuel efficiency compared to their traditional counterparts.<ref>[http://www.businessweek.com/technology/content/sep2005/tc20050920_8040_tc_217.htm "Hybrids: More Power, Less Fuel"], ''Business Week'', September 20, 2005.</ref> The trade-off between added performance and improved fuel efficiency is partly controlled by the software within the hybrid system and partly the result of the engine, battery and motor size. In the future, manufacturers may provide HEV owners with the ability to partially control this balance (fuel efficiency vs. added performance) as they wish, through a user-controlled setting.<ref>[http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2005/08/0808_050808_hybrid_cars.html "Hybrid Cars Losing Efficiency, Adding Oomph"], ''National Geographic'', August 8, 2005.</ref> Toyota announced in January, 2006 that it was considering a "high-efficiency" button.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}

===Conversion kits===
{{Main|Electric vehicle conversion}}

One can buy a stock hybrid or convert a stock petroleum car to a hybrid electric vehicle using an [[aftermarket kit|aftermarket hybrid kit]] .<ref>http://www.go-ev.com/EMIS.html</ref>

==Environmental impact==
===Fuel consumption===
{{Main|Fuel efficiency}}

Current HEVs reduce petroleum consumption under certain circumstances, compared to otherwise similar conventional vehicles, primarily by using three mechanisms <ref>{{cite book |last=Rius |first=B. |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Electric Drive Design for Hybrid Electric Vehicle Optimum Fuel Efficiency|year=2008 |publisher=Shaker Verlag |location=Aachen |isbn=978-3-8322-7269-2}}</ref>:
#Reducing wasted energy during idle/low output, generally by turning the ICE off
#Recapturing waste energy (i.e. regenerative braking)
#Reducing the size and power of the ICE, and hence inefficiencies from under-utilization, by using the added power from the electric motor to compensate for the loss in peak power output from the smaller ICE.

Any combination of these three primary hybrid advantages may be used in different vehicles to realize different fuel usage, power, emissions, weight and cost profiles. The ICE in an HEV can be smaller, lighter, and more efficient than the one in a conventional vehicle, because the combustion engine can be sized for slightly above ''average'' power demand rather than ''peak'' power demand. The drive system in a vehicle is required to operate over a range of speed and power, but an ICE's highest efficiency is in a narrow range of operation, making conventional vehicles inefficient.  On the contrary, in most HEV designs, the ICE operates closer to its range of highest efficiency more frequently. The power curve of electric motors is better suited to variable speeds and can provide substantially greater torque at low speeds compared with internal-combustion engines. The greater [[Fuel economy in automobiles|fuel economy]] of HEVs has implication for reduced petroleum consumption and [[roadway air dispersion modeling|vehicle air pollution emissions]] worldwide<ref>{{cite web | title=Real Hybrid Mileage Database | work=GreenHybrid.com | url=http://www.greenhybrid.com/compare/mileage/ | accessdate=January 11 | accessyear=2006}}</ref>

===Noise===
Reduced noise emissions resulting from substantial use of the electric motor at idling and low speeds, leading to  [[roadway noise|roadway]] [[noise mitigation|noise reduction]],<ref>[http://luminatechnologies.org/luminaaco.html C. Michael Hogan and Amy Gregory, ''Hybrid vehicle emission noise comparison study'', Lumina Technologies, June 1, 2006]</ref> in comparison to conventional gasoline or diesel powered engine vehicles, resulting in beneficial [[noise health effects]] (although road noise from tires and wind, the loudest noises at highway speeds from the interior of most vehicles, are not affected by the hybrid design alone).

Reduced noise may not be beneficial for all road users, as blind people or the visually-impaired consider the noise of combustion engines a helpful aid while crossing streets and feel quiet hybrids could pose an unexpected hazard.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.usatoday.com/money/economy/2007-10-03-2698183585_x.htm|title=Blind people: Hybrid cars pose hazard|publisher=[[USA Today]]|author=Ben Nuckols |date=2007-10-03|accessdate=2009-05-08}}</ref> The [[U.S. Congress]] and the [[European Commission]] are exploring legislation to establish a minimum level of sound for [[electric vehicle|electric]] and hybrid electric vehicles when operating in electric mode, so that blind people and other pedestrians and cyclists can hear them coming and detect from which direction they are approaching. Tests have shown that vehicles operating in electric mode can be particularly hard to hear below 20&nbsp;mph (32&nbsp;km/h).<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.economist.com/science/displaystory.cfm?story_id=13606446|title=Electric cars and noise: The sound of silence|publisher=[[The Economist]]|date=2009-05-07|accessdate=2009-05-08}}</ref>

A study conducted by the [[National Highway Traffic Safety Administration|U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration]]<ref name=NHTSA>{{cite web|url=http://www-nrd.nhtsa.dot.gov/Pubs/811204.PDF|title=Incidence of Pedestrian and Bicyclist Crashes by Hybrid Electric Passenger Vehicles|author= |publisher=[[National Highway Traffic Safety Administration]] |date=September 2009|accessdate=2009-10-05}} Technical Report DOT HS 811 204</ref> found that crashes  involving pedestrian and bicyclist have higher incidence rates for HEVs than [[internal combustion engine]] (ICE) vehicles in certain vehicle maneuvers. These accidents commonly occurred on in zones with low speed limits, during daytime and in clear weather. The study found that a HEV was two times more likely to be involved in a pedestrian crash than was an ICE vehicle when a vehicle is slowing or stopping, backing up, or entering or leaving a parking space. Vehicle maneuvers were grouped in one category considering those maneuvers that might have occurred at very low speeds where the difference between the sound levels produced by the hybrid versus ICE vehicle is the greatest. Also the study found that the incidence rate of pedestrian crashes in scenarios when vehicles make a turn was significantly higher for HEVs when compared to ICE vehicles. Similarly, The NHTSA study also concluded that the incidence rate of bicyclist crashes involving HEVs for the same kind of maneuvers was significantly higher when compared to ICE vehicles.<ref name=NHTSA/>

===Pollution===
Reduced [[air pollution]] emissions, due to lower fuel consumption, lead improved human health with regard to [[respiratory]] problems and other illnesses.  Pollution reduction in urban environments may be particularly significant due to elimination of idle-at-rest.{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}}

Battery toxicity is a concern, although today's hybrids use [[NiMH]] batteries, not the environmentally problematic rechargeable [[NiCd|nickel cadmium]]. "Nickel metal hydride batteries are benign. They can be fully recycled," says Ron Cogan, editor of the Green Car Journal.{{Cite quote|date=May 2008}} Toyota and Honda say that they will recycle dead batteries and that disposal will pose no toxic hazards. Toyota puts a phone number on each battery, and they pay a $200 "bounty" for each battery to help ensure that it will be properly recycled.

===Buses===
{{Main|Hybrid electric bus}}

Hybrid technology for buses has seen increased attention since recent battery developments decreased battery weight significantly. Drivetrains consist of conventional diesel engines and gas turbines. Some designs concentrate on using car engines, recent designs have focused on using conventional diesel engines already used in bus designs, to save on engineering and training costs. Several manufacturers are currently working on new hybrid designs, or hybrid drivetrains that fit into existing chassis offerings without major re-design. A challenge to hybrid buses may still come from cheaper lightweight imports from the former Eastern block countries or China, where national operators are looking at fuel consumption issues surrounding the weight of the bus, which has increased with recent bus technology innovations such as glazing, air conditioning and electrical systems. A hybrid bus can also deliver fuel economy though through the hybrid drivetrain. Hybrid technology is also being promoted by environmentally concerned transit authorities.

===Trucks===
In 2003, [[General Motors|GM]] introduced a hybrid [[diesel-electric]] military (light) truck, equipped with a diesel electric and a fuel cell auxiliary power unit. Hybrid electric light trucks were introduced in 2004 by [[Mercedes Benz]] ([[Mercedes-Benz Sprinter|Sprinter]]) and [[Micro-Vett SPA]] (Daily Bimodale). [[Navistar International|International Truck and Engine Corp.]] and [[Eaton Corp.]] have been selected to manufacture diesel-electric hybrid trucks for a US pilot program serving the utility industry in 2004. In mid 2005 [[Isuzu]] introduced the Elf Diesel Hybrid Truck on the Japanese Market. They claim that approximately 300 vehicles, mostly route buses are using Hinos HIMR (Hybrid Inverter Controlled Motor & Retarder) system.

== Hybrid Premium and Showroom Cost Parity ==
{{Electric vehicle}}

HEVs can be initially more expensive (the so-called "hybrid premium") than pure [[fossil fuel|fossil-fuel]]-based [[ICE|ICE vehicles]] (ICEVs), due to extra batteries, more electronics and in some cases other design considerations (although [[charging station|battery renting can be used]] to reach the cost parity). The [[wikt:trade-off|trade-off]] between higher initial cost (also called showroom costs) and lower fuel costs (difference often referred to as the [[payback period]]) is dependent on usage - miles traveled, or hours of operation, fuel costs, and in some cases, government subsidies. Traditional economy vehicles may result in a lower direct cost for many users (before consideration of any [[externality]]).

''[[Consumer Reports]]'' ran an article in April 2006 stating that HEVs would not pay for themselves over 5 years of ownership.  However, this included an error with charging the "hybrid premium" twice.<ref>{{ cite news | title = Consumer Reports Revises Financial Analysis In Report on Ownership Costs for Hybrid Cars | date = [[7 March]] [[2006]] | publisher = Consumers Union | url = http://www.consumerreports.org/cro/cu-press-room/pressroom/archive/2006/04/eng0604ehv.htm | author = Consumer Reports | accessdate = 2007-04-27 }}</ref> When corrected, the Honda Civic Hybrid and [[Toyota Prius]] did have a payback period of slightly less than 5 years.<ref>{{ cite web | url = http://www.consumerreports.org/cro/cars/new-cars/high-cost-of-hybrid-vehicles-406/overview/index.htm | title = The dollars & sense of hybrid cars }}</ref> This includes conservative estimates with depreciation (seen as more depreciation than a conventional vehicle, although that is not the current norm) and with progressively-higher gas prices.  In particular, the Consumer Reports article assumed $2/U.S.&nbsp;gallon for 3 years, $3/U.S.&nbsp;gallon for one year and $4/U.S.&nbsp;gallon the last year.  As recent events have shown, this is a volatile market and hard to predict.  For 2006, gas prices ranged from low $2 to low $3, averaging about $2.60/U.S.&nbsp;gallon.

A January 2007 analysis by Intellichoice.com shows that all 22 currently available HEVs will save their owners money over a five year period.  The most savings is for the Toyota Prius, which has a five year cost of ownership 40.3% lower than the cost of comparable non-hybrid vehicles.<ref>{{ cite web | title = Hybrids Cost-Efficient Over Long Haul | publisher = Business Week | url = http://www.businessweek.com/autos/content/jan2007/bw20070108_774581.htm?chan=top+news_top+news+index_autos | date = [[9 January]] [[2007]] }}</ref>

A report in the ''[[Greeley Tribune]]'' says that over the five years it would typically take for a new car owner to pay off the vehicle cost differential, a hybrid [[Camry]] driver could save up to $6,700 in gasoline at current gasoline prices, with hybrid tax incentives as an additional saving.<ref>{{ cite web | url = http://www6.lexisnexis.com/publisher/EndUser?Action=UserDisplayFullDocument&orgId=101846&topicId=103840033&docId=l:618716736 | publisher = Greeley Tribune | first = Rebecca | last = Boyle | title = Are hybrid cars worth the cost? | accessdate = 2007-06-13 }}</ref>

In countries with incentives to fight against [[global warming]] and [[contamination]] and promote vehicle [[fuel efficiency]], the [[wikt:pay-back|pay-back]] period can be immediate and all-combustion engine vehicles (ACEVs) can cost more than hybrids because they generate more pollution.

Toyota and Honda have already said they've halved the incremental cost of electric hybrids and see cost parity in the future (even without incentives) <ref>http://www.calcars.org/calcars-news/1025.html</ref>.

==Raw materials shortage==
{{See|Materials science}}

The [[rare earth element]] [[dysprosium]] is required to fabricate many of the advanced [[electric motors]] and battery systems in hybrid propulsion systems <ref name=autogenerated1>G, Nishiyama.

A few non-Chinese sources such as the advanced [[Hoidas Lake]] project in northern  [[Canada]] as well as [[Mt Weld]] in [[Australia]] are currently under development;<ref name=autogenerated2 /> however it is not known if these sources will be developed before a shortage hits.

==Legislation and incentives==
In order to encourage the purchase of HEVs, several [[incentive]]s and [[ecotax]]es have been made into law.

===Canada===
Residents in Ontario and Quebec, Canada can claim a rebate on the Provincial Retail Sales Tax of up to $2,000 CDN on the purchase or lease of a hybrid electric vehicle.<ref>{{ cite web | url = http://www.trd.fin.gov.on.ca/userfiles/HTML/cma_3_6551_1.html | title = Vehicles Powered by Alternative Fuels | publisher = Government of Ontario | accessdate = 2006-10-10 }}</ref> Ontario recently announced a new green license plate for hybrid car users and will announce a slew of benefits that go along with it in 2008.<ref>[http://www.canada.com/ottawacitizen/news/story.html?id=8433f2be-5d58-4610-87ac-04c65953e60a&k=15430 Ontario to offer perks for drivers who go green<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Residents in British Columbia are eligible for a 100% reduction of sales tax up to a maximum of $2,000 if the hybrid electric vehicle is purchased or leased before April 1, 2011 (extended in 2007/2008 budget from March 31, 2008 and expanded from a maximum of only $1,000 from April 1, 2008 to March 31, 2009, at which point the concession was scheduled to expire.)<ref>{{ cite web | title = British Columbia Provincial Government Budget 2007/2008 to 2008/2009| url = http://www.bcbudget.gov.bc.ca/2007/bfp/default.aspx?hash=8 | publisher = Government of British Columbia | accessdate = 2007-03-22 }}</ref> Prince Edward Island residents can claim rebates on the Provincial Sales Tax of up to $3,000 CDN on the purchase or lease of any hybrid vehicles since March 30, 2004.<ref>{{ cite web | url = http://www.gov.pe.ca/infopei/index.php3?number=1017738&lang=E | title = Tax Incentive for Hybrid Vehicles | publisher = Government of Prince Edward Island | accessdate = 2008-04-21 }}</ref>

===Jordan===
In [[Jordan]], a full import customs and sales tax exemption is granted for all hybrid vehicles, the former that can reach up to 80% of the vehicle list price based on the engine size. This opened the door for a huge surge in the import of second hand hybrid vehicles, chiefly from the US and Canada, mostly Toyota Camry, Lexus RX and GM brands such as Tahoe and Escalade.

Official dealers of car makers that produce hybrid vehicles such as Toyota and Honda are still reluctant in offering the hybrid counterparts of the base models such as the Toyota Camry & Honda Civic for unknown reasons! Toyota local dealer however is heavily marketing the Toyota Prius as a niche product.

===Republic of Ireland===
In the [[Republic of Ireland]], a 50% reduction in VRT applies, which normally amounts to 25% of the market value of a car.

===Netherlands===
In the [[Netherlands]], the [[Vehicle Registration Tax]] (VRT), payable when a car is sold to its first buyer, can earn the owner of an HEV a discount up to [[<U+20AC>]]6,000.

===Sweden===
In [[Sweden]] there is an "Eco car" subsidy of SEK 10 000 (~ USD 1.600) cash payout to private car owners. For fringe benefit cars there is a reduction of the benefit tax of 40% for EV's & HEV's and 20% for other "Eco cars".<ref>[http://www.vv.se/templates/page3____21927.aspx Eco car subsidy / V<U+00E4>gverket<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

===United Kingdom===
Drivers of HEVs in the [[United Kingdom]] benefit from the lowest band of vehicle excise duty (car tax), which is based on [[carbon dioxide]] emissions. In central [[London]], these vehicles are also exempt from the <U+00A3>8 daily [[London congestion charge]].<ref>[http://www.cclondon.com/exemptions.shtml Discounts and exemptions | Transport for London<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Due to their low levels of regulated emissions, the greenest cars are eligible for 100% discount under the current system. To be eligible the car must be on the current Power Shift Register.<ref>[http://www.est.org.uk/uploads/documents/fleet/PowerShift%20Register%2020.02.07.pdf Microsoft Word - 20.02.07_PowerShift Register<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> At present, these include the cleanest [[LPG]] and [[natural gas]] cars and most hybrid-, battery- and fuel cell-electric vehicles.

===United States===
====Federal====
{{See|Hybrid tax credit}}

The purchase of hybrid electric cars qualifies for a federal income [[tax credit]] up to $3,150 on the purchaser's Federal income taxes. The [[tax credit]] is to be phased out two calendar quarters after the manufacturer reaches 60,000 new cars sold in the following manner: it will be reduced to 50% ($1700) if delivered in either the third or fourth quarter after the threshold is reached, to 25% ($850) in the fifth and sixth quarters, and 0% thereafter.<ref>[http://www.irs.gov/newsroom/article/0,,id=157557,00.html Summary of the Credit for Qualified Hybrid Vehicles]</ref>

====States and local====
* Certain states (e.g., [[New York]], [[California]], [[Virginia]], and [[Florida]]) allow singly-occupied HEVs to enter the [[High-occupancy vehicle lane|HOV lanes]] on the highway. Initially, the [[Federal Highway Administration]] ruled that this was a violation of federal statute<ref>{{cite web | title=High Occupancy Vehicle (HOV) Systems | work=Virginia Department of Transportation | url=http://www.virginiadot.org/comtravel/hov-rulesfaq.asp | accessdate=January 11 | accessyear=2006}}</ref> until [[August 10]] [[2005]] when [[George W. Bush]] signed the [[Safe, Accountable, Flexible, Efficient Transportation Equity Act: A Legacy for Users|Transportation Equity Act of 2005]] into law.
* Some states, e.g. [[California]], exempt hybrid electric cars from the biennial [[smog]] inspection, which costs over $50 ({{As of|2004|lc=on}}).
* The city of [[San Jose, California]] issued a free parking tag until 2007 when it became issued for a fee annually for hybrid electric cars that were purchased at a San Jose dealership. The qualified owners do not have to pay for parking in any city garage or road side parking meters.
* The city of [[Los Angeles, California]] offers free parking to all HEVs which started on [[1 October]] [[2004]]. The experiment is an extension to an existing offer of free parking for all pure electrical vehicles.
*In October, 2005, the city of [[Baltimore, Maryland]] started to offer discount on monthly parking in the city parking lots, and is considering free meter parking for HEVs. On [[3 November]] [[2005]], the ''[[Boston Globe]]'' reports that the city council of [[Boston, Massachusetts|Boston]] is considering the same treatment for hybrid electric cars.
* Annual vehicle registration fees in the [[Washington, D.C.|District of Columbia]] are half ($36) that paid for conventional vehicles ($72).
