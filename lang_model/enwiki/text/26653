Father '''Augustine Nguyen Lac Hoa''' (1908-c. 1989), a refugee Chinese Catholic priest in [[South Vietnam]], led a militia called the Sea Swallows that carved out an anticommunist enclave in the [[Viet Cong]]'s [[Ca Mau Peninsula]] stronghold. The "fighting priest" and his "village that refused to die" attracted admiring media stories, and in 1964 he received the [[Ramon Magsaysay Award]] in the Public Service category.

In January 1961, [[Edward Lansdale]] visited Father Hoa and Binh Hung. Back in Washington, he was surprised to find that President [[John F. Kennedy]] had taken a personal interest in his report on Hoa, and wanted it published in the ''[[Saturday Evening Post]]''.<ref>Al Santoli, ''To Bear Any Burden'', Dutton, 1985, pp. 78-81</ref> It was, attributed to "an American officer."<ref>An American Officer, "The Report the President Wanted Published," ''Saturday Evening Post'', May 20, 1961</ref> The town of [[Newburyport, Massachusetts]] adopted Binh Hung as a sister community<ref>Don Schanche, "Last Chance for Vietnam," ''Saturday Evening Post'', January 6, 1962</ref>, and the ''Post'' followed up with another story on Father Hoa.<ref>Don Schanche, "Father Hoa's Little War," ''Saturday Evening Post'', February 17, 1962</ref> Other correspondents who took up the story of the Sea Swallows included [[Dickey Chapelle]]<ref>Dickey Chapelle, "The Fighting Priest of South Vietnam," ''Reader's Digest'', July 1963</ref> and [[Stan Atkinson]]<ref>[http://www.ihffilm.com/111.html "The Village That Refused to Die"]</ref>, who remembered Father Hoa decades later as the "most unforgettable character" he met in his travels.<ref>Stan Atkinson, [http://www.uneeknet.com/fam/dad/072399C.htm "Stan Remembers: Father Hoa and his little army"], July 23, 1999</ref>

Father Hoa's success inspired others to join his Sea Swallows, including a company of "Nung tribesmen." Declassified documents would reveal that the Nung fighters were actually a contingent of Nationalist soldiers from the [[Republic of China]].<ref>George MacTurnan Kahin, ''Intervention: How America Became Involved in Vietnam'', Knopf, 1986</ref>
