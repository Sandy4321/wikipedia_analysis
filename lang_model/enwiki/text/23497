The '''United States lightship ''Huron'' (LV-103)''' is a [[lightvessel]] that was launched in 1920.  She is now a [[museum ship]]<ref>

In [[Lake Huron]], ''Huron'' was the third ship to be placed at Corsica Shoals, a station established in 1893, replacing a gas buoy that was "somewhat ineffective". Three vessels bore the designation of {{'}}''Huron'' Lightship' from 1893 to 1970. The first was ''Lightship No. 61'', a wooden-hulled ship, painted red with white lettering saying "Corsica Shoals" on her sides. ''Lightship No. 61'' served from September 1893 until 1921. She was lost during the November [[Great Lakes Storm of 1913]], which destroyed at least 12 ships and over 250 lives, when she was torn from her moorings and forced onto Point Edward on the Canadian shore.<ref>

==Lightship No. 103 construction and service==
''Huron'' was built by the [[Consolidated Shipbuilding Company]] in [[Morris Heights, New York]].  Her keel was laid in 1918 and completed at a cost of $147,428. At {{convert|96.5|ft|m}} long, {{convert|24|ft|m}} in the beam, drawing {{convert|9.5|ft|m}}, and weighing 312 tons,  Ship #103 was powered by a single compound reciprocating steam engine, driven by two coal-fired Scotch boilers. They put out {{convert|175|hp}}.<ref name="pepper">

Commissioned in 1921 as ''Lightship Number 103'', she operated primarily in southern [[Lake Huron]] near [[Port Huron]] and the mouth of the [[St. Clair River]].<ref name="USCGLV103">

In 1935 she was transferred to the Eleventh District for one year, seeing duty as a relief ship.  In 1935, ''Huron'' was repainted (with "Huron" on her sides, starboard side painted red and the port side painted black) and transferred to Corsica Shoals, approximately {{convert|6|mi|km}} north of the [[Blue Water Bridge]] (connecting [[Port Huron]] and [[Sarnia, Ontario|Sarnia]], [[Ontario]], Canada.)<ref name="pepper"/>

''Huron'' was equipped with one acetylene lens lantern, {{convert|300|mm}}, a {{convert|10|in|abbr=on}} steam whistle [[fog horn]], and a hand operated bell.<ref name="USCGLV103" />

After 1945 as ''Huron'', she was the only lightship that was painted black.<ref name="USCGLV103" />

In 1948, she was refitted to diesel power with twin six-cylinder GM 6-71 engines at the [[Defoe Shipbuilding Company]] of [[West Bay City, Michigan]].<ref>

On 7 May 1958, Coast Guardsman Robert Gullickson perished when a wave swamped a tender from ''Huron'' Lightship that he was aboard.  He is memorialized on the ship, as he was the only casualty during her many years of service.<ref>

On August 20, 1970, she weighed her anchor the last time from Corsica Shoal.  She was decommissioned at Detroit on August 25.  Upon decommissioning, she was replaced by an unmanned warning buoy light.  Ownership of ''Huron'' was transferred to the City of Port Huron the following June.<ref name="pepper"/>

{{Quote |text=Commissioned in 1921, the ''Huron'' began service as a relief vessel for other Great Lakes lightships. She is ninety-seven feet long, twenty-four feet in beam, and carried a crew of eleven. On clear nights her beacon could be seen for fourteen miles (21&nbsp;km). After serving in northern [[Lake Michigan]], the ''Huron'' was assigned to the [[Corsica Shoals, Michigan|Corsica Shoals]] in 1935. These shallow waters, six miles (10&nbsp;km) north of [[Port Huron, Michigan|Port Huron]], were the scene of frequent groundings by [[lake freighter]]s in the late nineteenth century. A [[Lightvessel|lightship]] station had been established there in 1893, since the manned ships were more reliable than lighted buoys. After 1940 the ''Huron'' was the only lightship on the [[Great Lakes]]. Retired from [[U.S. Coast Guard|Coast Guard]] Service in 1970, she was presented to the City of Port Huron in 1971. |sign=State historical marker<ref>
