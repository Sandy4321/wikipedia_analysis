'''Akismet''', or '''Automattic Kismet''', is a [[spam filter]]ing service created by [[Automattic]], the corporation which employs most of the main developers of the [[weblog]] platform [[WordPress]], and released on [[October 25]] [[2005]]. Akismet attempts to filter [[link spam]] from blog comments and spam [[TrackBack]] pings. The filter works by combining information about spam captured on all participating blogs, and then using those spam rules to block future spam. Akismet has captured over 10.1 billion spam comments and pings as of March 2009.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://akismet.com/stats/|title=Stats Page|publisher=Akismet|accessdate=2009-03-24}}</ref>

Akismet was originally developed to integrate with a [[plugin]] for WordPress. It is now included by default in all WordPress builds since version 2.0 and activated in all [[WordPress.com]]-hosted blogs. A public Akismet [[API]] has resulted in an Automattic sponsored plugin for [[Movable Type]],<ref>{{cite news|url=http://blog.akismet.com/2006/04/14/akismet-for-movable-type/|title=Akismet for Movable Type|publisher=Akismet|accessdate=2006-11-18|date=[[2006-04-14]]}}</ref> and third-party plugins for other platforms <ref>{{cite web|url=http://akismet.com/development/|title=Other Application Plugins|publisher=Akismet|accessdate=2007-01-17}}</ref>. Released under the GPL license<ref>{{cite web|url=http://svn.wp-plugins.org/akismet/trunk/|title=Akismet plugin source in GPL WordPress plugin directory}}</ref>, the Akismet plugin is [[free software]], although the code to the Akismet system itself (and the nature of the algorithm used) has not been released.

The Akismet service is free for personal use. To use Akismet with most blogs, it is necessary to obtain a WordPress.com [[API key]]. Bloggers with a [[Yahoo!]] hosting account get a free "pro-blogger" Akismet service (which costs non-Yahoo! users $5/month) due to a deal between the two companies.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://blog.akismet.com/2005/12/20/yodel-if-you-hate-spam/|title=Yodel if you Hate Spam|publisher=Akismet|date=[[2005-12-20]]|accessdate=2006-11-18}}</ref>

== Criticism ==

Many bloggers have complained of commenters being wrongfully flagged as spammers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.phsdl.net/phsdl-vs-akismet-complaint.php|title=PHSDL vs. Akismet Complaint|publisher=PHSDL|accessdate=2007-12-31}}</ref> Once a commenter is flagged as a spammer, it becomes difficult to participate on a wordpress blog which uses Akismet filter because comments are sent to the spam queue before approval or deletion.

There is also anecdotal evidence that those who have an opinion that differs from the programmers face blackballing by the Akismet service.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://en.forums.wordpress.com/topic.php?id=19711|title=Akismet eating my comments|publisher=Timethief|accessdate=2008-06-11}}</ref> Some who voice a negative opinion about the actions of Matt Mullenweg have alleged that their comments are blackballed by the service<ref>{{cite web|url=http://drmikessteakdinner.com/2008/06/11/how-matt-mullenweg-and-automattic-deals-with-complaints/|title=How Matt Mullenweg and Automattic deals with complaints|publisher=Dr. Mike Wendell|accessdate=2008-06-11}}</ref>.

== Competitors ==

There are a number of competitors to Akismet, including [[Mollom]], [[Defensio]], and [[Typepad Antispam]]. In addition, image or maths [[CAPTCHA]] plugins are also widely used instead of Akismet.
