'''''Sir Gawain and the Green Knight''''' is a late 14th-century [[Middle English]] [[Alliterative verse|alliterative]] [[chivalric romance|romance]] outlining an adventure of Sir [[Gawain]], a knight of [[King Arthur]]'s [[Round Table (Camelot)|Round Table]]. In the tale, Sir Gawain accepts a challenge from a mysterious warrior who is completely green, from his clothes and hair to his beard and skin. The "[[Green Knight]]" offers to allow anyone to strike him with his axe if the challenger will take a return blow in a [[Year and a day rule|year and a day]]. Gawain accepts, and beheads him in one blow, only to have the Green Knight stand up, pick up his head, and remind Gawain to meet him at the appointed time. The story of Gawain's struggle to meet the appointment and his adventures along the way demonstrate the spirit of [[chivalry]] and [[loyalty]].

The poem survives in a single manuscript, the ''Cotton Nero A.x.'', that also includes three religious pieces, ''[[Pearl (poem)|Pearl]]'', ''[[Cleanness]]'', and ''[[Patience (poem)|Patience]]''. These works are thought to have been written by the same unknown author, dubbed the "[[Pearl Poet]]" or "Gawain Poet." All four [[narrative poetry|narrative poems]] are written in a [[North Midlands|North]] [[West Midlands (region)|West Midland]] dialect of Middle English.<ref name = norton>''The Norton Anthology of English Literature''. Ed. Stephen Greenblatt. 8th ed. Vol. B. New York, London: W. W. Norton and Co., 2006. pp.&nbsp;19<U+2013>21 and 160<U+2013>161.

In addition to its complex plot and rich language, the poem's chief interest for [[literary criticism|literary critics]] is its sophisticated use of medieval [[symbol]]ism. Everything from the Green Knight, to the beheading game, to the [[girdle]] given to Gawain as protection from the axe, is richly symbolic and steeped in [[Celts|Celtic]], [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]], and other folklore and cultural traditions. The Green Knight, for example, is interpreted by some as a representation of the [[Green Man]] of Celtic legend and by others as an allusion to [[Christ]].

''Sir Gawain and the Green Knight'' is an important poem in the [[Romance (genre)|romance genre]], which typically involves a hero who goes on a quest that tests his ability. The ambiguity of the poem's ending, however, makes it more complex than most. Christian readings of the poem argue for an [[apocalypse|apocalyptic]] interpretation, drawing parallels between Gawain and [[Lady Bertilak]] and the story of [[Adam and Eve]]. Feminist interpretations disagree at the most basic level, some arguing that women are in total control from beginning to end, while others argue that their control is only an illusion. Cultural critics have argued that the poem is best read as an expression of tensions between the [[Welsh people|Welsh]] and [[English people|English]] present at the time in the poet's dialect region. The poem remains popular to this day, through translations from renowned authors like [[J. R. R. Tolkien]] and [[Simon Armitage]], as well as through recent film and stage adaptations.

==Synopsis==
[[Image:Gawain and the Green Knight.jpg|thumb|230px|Sir Gawain and the Green Knight (from original manuscript, artist unknown)]]
The story begins in [[Camelot]] on [[New Year's Day]] as King Arthur's court is feasting and exchanging gifts. A large Green Knight armed with an axe enters the hall and proposes a game. He asks for someone in the court to strike him once with his axe, on condition that the Green Knight will return the blow one year and one day later.<ref name = year>For reasons not entirely understood, the Celts used the phrase "a year and a day", to refer to exactly one year. See for example W. J. McGee's "The Beginning of Mathematics." ''American Anthropologist.'' (Oct 1899) Vol. 1 Iss. 4 pp.&nbsp;646<U+2013>674.</ref> Sir Gawain, the youngest of Arthur's knights and nephew to the king, accepts the challenge. He severs the giant's head in one stroke, expecting him to die. The Green Knight, however, picks up his own head, reminds Gawain to meet him at the [[Green Knight#Green Chapel|Green Chapel]] in a year and a day (New Year's Day the next year) and rides away.

As the date approaches Sir Gawain sets off to find the Green Chapel and complete his bargain with the Green Knight. His long journey leads him to a beautiful castle where he meets Bertilak de Hautdesert, the lord of the castle, and his beautiful wife; both are pleased to have such a renowned guest. Gawain tells them of his New Year's appointment at the Green Chapel and says that he must continue his search as he only has a few days remaining. Bertilak laughs and explains that the Green Chapel is less than two miles away and proposes that Gawain stay at the castle.

Before going hunting the next day, Bertilak proposes a bargain to Gawain: he will give Gawain whatever he catches, on condition that Gawain give him whatever he might gain during the day. Gawain accepts. After Bertilak leaves, the lady of the castle, [[Lady Bertilak]], visits Gawain's bedroom to seduce him. Despite her best efforts, however, he yields nothing but a single kiss. When Bertilak returns and gives Gawain the deer he has killed, his guest responds by returning the lady's kiss to Bertilak, without divulging its source. The next day, the lady comes again, Gawain dodges her advances, and there is a similar exchange of a hunted [[boar]] for two kisses. She comes once more on the third morning, and Gawain accepts from her a green silk [[girdle]], which the lady promises will keep him from all physical harm. They exchange three kisses. That evening, Bertilak returns with a fox, which he exchanges with Gawain for the three kisses. Gawain keeps the girdle, however.

The next day, Gawain leaves for the Green Chapel with the girdle. He finds the Green Knight at the chapel sharpening an axe, and, as arranged, bends over to receive his blow. The first swing, Gawain flinches and the Green Knight belittles him for it. The Green Knight swings to behead Gawain, but holds back twice, only striking softly on the third swing, causing a small scar on his neck. The Green Knight then reveals himself to be the lord of the castle, Bertilak de Hautdesert, and explains that the entire adventure was a mere game arranged through the magical manipulations of [[Morgan le Fay]], Arthur's mischievous sister. Gawain is at first ashamed and upset, but the two men part on cordial terms and Gawain returns to Camelot, wearing the girdle in shame as a token of his failure to keep his promise with Bertilak and to fully follow the rules of the game. The Knights of the Round Table, it is decreed, should henceforth wear a green [[sash]] in recognition of Gawain's adventure.

Though the real name of "The ''Gawain'' Poet" (or poets) is unknown, some inferences about him or her can be drawn from an informed reading of his or her works. The manuscript of ''Gawain'' is known in academic circles as ''Cotton Nero A.x'', following a naming system used by one of its owners, [[Robert Bruce Cotton|Robert Cotton]], a collector of Medieval English texts.<ref name =ucalgary>{{cite web | title = Web Resources for Pearl-poet Study: A Vetted Selection | publisher = Univ. of Calgary | url = http://www.ucalgary.ca/~scriptor/cotton/blog.html | accessdate = 2007-04-01}}</ref> Before the ''Gawain'' manuscript came into Cotton's possession, it was in the library of [[Henry Savile (Bible translator)|Henry Savile]] of Bank in [[Yorkshire]].<ref>{{cite web | title = Pearl: Introduction | publisher = Medieval Institute Publications, Inc. | year = 2001 | url = http://www.lib.rochester.edu/camelot/teams/pearlint.htm | accessdate = 2007-04-02}}</ref> Little is known about its previous ownership, and until 1824, when the manuscript was introduced to the academic community in a second edition of [[Thomas Warton]]'s ''History'' edited by [[Richard Price (British historian)|Richard Price]], it was almost entirely unknown. Even then, the ''Gawain'' poem was not published in its entirety until 1839.<ref>Turville-Petre, Thorlac. The Alliterative Revival. Woodbridge: Brewer [[etc.]], 1977. pp.&nbsp;126<U+2013>129.

''The Broadview Anthology of British Literature: The Medieval Period'', Vol. 1., ed. Joseph Black, ''et al.'' Toronto: Broadview Press, Introduction, p.&nbsp;235. ISBN 1-55111-609-X</ref> The three other works found in the same manuscript as ''Gawain'', (commonly known as ''[[Pearl (poem)|Pearl]]'', ''[[Patience (poem)|Patience]]'', and ''[[Cleanness]]'' or ''Purity'') are often considered to be written by the same author. However, the manuscript containing these poems was transcribed by a copyist and not by the original poet. Although nothing explicitly suggests that all four poems are by the same poet, comparative analysis of dialect, verse form, and diction have pointed towards single-authorship.<ref name = poet>Nelles, William. "The Pearl-Poet". ''Cyclopedia of World Authors'', Fourth Revised Edition Database: MagillOnLiterature Plus, 1958.</ref>

What is known today about the poet is largely general. As [[J. R. R. Tolkien]] and E. V. Gordon, after reviewing the text's allusions, style, and themes, concluded in 1925:
{{quote|He was a man of serious and devout mind, though not without humour; he had an interest in theology, and some knowledge of it, though an amateur knowledge perhaps, rather than a professional; he had Latin and French and was well enough read in French books, both romantic and instructive; but his home was in the West Midlands of England; so much his language shows, and his metre, and his scenery.<ref name = Tolkien/>}}

The most commonly suggested candidate for authorship is John Massey of Cotton, Cheshire.<ref>Peterson, Clifford J. "The Pearl-Poet and John Massey of Cotton, Cheshire". ''The Review of English Studies, New Series''. (1974) 25.99 pp.&nbsp;257<U+2013>266.</ref> He is known to have lived in the dialect region of the Pearl Poet and is thought to have written the poem, ''[[St. Erkenwald (poem)|St. Erkenwald]]'', which some scholars argue bears stylistic similarities to ''Gawain''. ''St. Erkenwald'', however, has been dated by some scholars to a time outside the Gawain poet's era. Thus, ascribing authorship to John Massey is still controversial and most critics consider the Gawain poet an unknown.<ref name = poet/>

==Verse form==
The 2,530 lines and 101 [[stanzas]] that make up ''Sir Gawain and the Green Knight'' are written in what linguists call the "[[Alliterative Revival]]" style typical of the 14th century. Instead of focusing on a [[Meter (poetry)|metrical]] syllabic count and [[rhyme]], the [[Alliterative verse|alliterative form]] of this period usually relied on the agreement of a pair of stressed syllables at the beginning of the line and another pair at the end. Each line always includes a pause, called a ''[[caesura]]'', at some point after the first two stresses, dividing it into two half-lines. Although he largely follows the form of his day, the Gawain poet was somewhat freer with convention than his or her predecessors. The poet broke the alliterative lines into variable-length groups and ended these nominal stanzas with a rhyming section of five lines known as the ''[[bob and wheel]]'', in which the "bob" is a very short line, sometimes of only two syllables, followed by the "wheel," longer lines with [[internal rhyme]].<ref name = norton />

The earliest known story to feature a beheading game is the 8th-century [[Middle Irish]] tale ''[[Bricriu's Feast]]''. This story parallels ''Gawain'' in that, like the Green Knight, [[C<U+00FA> Chulainn]]'s antagonist feints three blows with the axe before letting his target depart without injury. A beheading exchange also appears in the late 12th century ''[[Caradoc|Life of Caradoc]]'', a [[Middle French]] narrative embedded in the anonymous [[Perceval, the Story of the Grail#First Continuation|First Continuation]] of [[Chr<U+00E9>tien de Troyes]]' ''[[Perceval, the Story of the Grail]]''. A notable difference in this story is that Caradoc's challenger is his father in disguise, come to test his honour. [[Lancelot]] is given a beheading challenge in the early 13th-century ''[[Perlesvaus]]'', in which a knight begs him to chop off his head or else put his own in jeopardy. Lancelot reluctantly cuts it off, agreeing to come to the same place in a year to put his head in the same danger. When Lancelot arrives, the people of the town celebrate and announce that they have finally found a true knight. Many others had been tested and failed this test of chivalry.<ref name = Brewer/>

The stories ''The Girl with the Mule'' (alternately titled ''The Mule Without a Bridle'') and ''Hunbaut'' feature Gawain in beheading game situations. In ''Hunbaut'' Gawain cuts off a man's head and, before he can replace it, removes the magic cloak keeping the man alive, thus killing him. Several stories tell of knights who struggle to stave off the advances of voluptuous women sent by their lords as a test; these stories include ''Yder'', the [[Lancelot-Grail]], ''Hunbaut'', and ''The Knight of the Sword''. The last two involve Gawain specifically. Usually the temptress is the daughter or wife of a lord to whom the knight owes respect, and the knight is tested to see whether or not he will remain [[chaste]] in trying circumstances.<ref name = Brewer>Brewer, Elisabeth.

In the first branch of the medieval Welsh collection of tales known as the ''[[Mabinogion]]'', [[Pwyll]] exchanges places for a year with [[Arawn]] the lord of [[Annwn]] (the Otherworld). Despite having his appearance changed to resemble Arawn exactly, Pwyll does not have sexual relations with Arawn's wife during this time, thus establishing a lasting friendship between the two men. The story may, then, provide a background for the seduction test when Gawain attempts to resist to the wife of the Green Knight; thus, the story of Sir Gawain and the Green Knight may be seen as a tale which combines elements of the Celtic beheading game with a Celtic version of a seduction test, as Arawn is pleased to find that Pwyll has not slept with Arawn's wife. Some scholars disagree with this interpretation, however, as Arawn seems to have accepted the notion that Pwyll may reciprocate with his wife, making it less of a "seduction test" per se as seduction tests typically involve a Lord and Lady conspiring to seduce a knight, seemingly ''against'' the wishes of the Lord.<ref name =friedman>Friedman, Albert B.

==Themes==
===Temptation and testing===
[[Image:Leighton-God Speed!.jpg|thumb|Knights of ''Gawain's'' time were tested in their ability to balance the male-oriented [[chivalry|chivalric code]] with the female-oriented rules of [[courtly love]].<br /> (''God Speed!'' - [[Edmund Blair Leighton#List of works|Edmund Blair Leighton]] 1900)]]
The heart of ''Sir Gawain and the Green Knight'' is the test of Gawain's adherence to the code of [[chivalry]]. The typical [[temptation]] [[fable]] of [[medieval literature]] presents a series of tribulations assembled as tests or "proofs" of moral [[virtue]]. The stories often describe several individuals' failures after which the main character is tested.<ref name= "kittsix">Kittredge, George Lyman. ''A Study of Sir Gawain and the Green Knight''. Harvard University Press, 1960. p.&nbsp;76. ASIN B0006AWBXS</ref> Success in the proofs will often bring immunity or good fortune. Gawain's ability to pass the tests of his host are of utmost importance to his survival, though he does not know it. It is only by fortuity or <U+201C>instinctive-courtesy<U+201D> that Sir Gawain is able to pass his test.<ref name= "kitteight">Kittredge, p.&nbsp;83</ref>

In addition to the laws of chivalry, Gawain must respect another set of laws concerning [[courtly love]]. The [[knight]]<U+2019>s code of honour requires him to do whatever a [[damsel]] asks. Gawain must accept the girdle from the Lady, but he must also keep the promise he has made to his host that he will give whatever he gains that day. Gawain chooses to keep the girdle out of fear of death, thus breaking his promise to the host but honouring the lady. Upon learning that the Green Knight is actually his host, he realises that although he has completed his quest, he has failed to be virtuous. This test demonstrates the conflict between honour and knightly duties. In breaking his promise, Gawain believes he has lost his honour and failed in his duties.<ref>Burrow, J.A. ''A Reading of Sir Gawain and the Green Knight''. London: Kegan Paul Ltd., 1965. p.&nbsp;162. ISBN 0710086954</ref>

===Hunting and seduction===
Scholars have frequently noted the parallels between the three hunting scenes and the three seduction scenes in ''Gawain''. They are generally agreed that the fox chase has significant parallels to the third seduction scene, in which Gawain accepts the girdle from Bertilak's wife. Gawain, like the fox, fears for his life and is looking for a way to avoid death from the Green Knight's axe. Like his counterpart, he resorts to trickery in order to save his skin. The fox uses tactics so unlike the first two animals, and so unexpectedly, that Bertilak has the hardest time hunting it. Similarly, Gawain finds the Lady's advances in the third seduction scene more unpredictable and challenging to resist than her previous attempts. She changes her evasive language, typical of [[courtly love]] relationships, to a more assertive style. Her dress, relatively modest in earlier scenes, is suddenly voluptuous and revealing.<ref name = Burnley>Burnley, J.D. "The Hunting Scenes in 'Sir Gawain and the Green Knight' ". ''The Yearbook of English Studies''. (1973) Vol. 3, pp.&nbsp;1<U+2013>9.</ref>

The deer- and boar-hunting scenes are less clearly connected, although scholars have attempted to link each animal to Gawain's reactions in the parallel seduction scene. Attempts to connect the deer hunt with the first seduction scene have unearthed a few parallels. Deer hunts of the time, like courtship, had to be done according to established rules. Women often favoured suitors who hunted well and skinned their animals, sometimes even watching while a deer was cleaned.<ref name = Burnley/><ref>The "hyndez" (hinds) first described in the poem are probably from [[red deer]], a species with large antlers like the [[elk|American elk]], while the subsequent "dos and of o<U+00FE>er dere" (does and other deer) likely refer to the smaller [[fallow deer]]. (Ong, Walter J. "The Green Knight's Harts and Bucks". ''Modern Language Notes''. (December 1950) 65.8 pp.&nbsp;536<U+2013>539.)</ref> The sequence describing the deer hunt is relatively unspecific and nonviolent, with an air of relaxation and exhilaration. The first seduction scene follows in a similar vein, with no overt physical advances and no apparent danger; the entire exchange is humorously portrayed.<ref name = Burnley/>

The boar-hunting scene is, in contrast, laden with detail. Boars at the time were much more difficult to hunt than deer; approaching one with only a sword was akin to challenging a knight to single combat. In the hunting sequence, the boar flees but is cornered before a ravine. He turns to face Bertilak with his back to the ravine, prepared to fight. Bertilak dismounts and in the ensuing fight kills the boar. He removes its head and displays it on a pike. In the seduction scene, Bertilak's wife, like the boar, is more forward, insisting that Gawain has a romantic reputation and that he must not disappoint her. Gawain, however, is successful in parrying her attacks, saying that surely she knows more than he about love. Both the boar hunt and the seduction scene can be seen as depictions of a moral victory: both Gawain and Bertilak face struggles alone and emerge triumphant.<ref name = Burnley/>

===Nature and chivalry===
Some argue that nature represents a chaotic, lawless order which is in direct confrontation with the civilisation of Camelot throughout ''Sir Gawain and the Green Knight''. The green horse and rider that first invade Arthur<U+2019>s peaceful halls are iconic representations of nature's disturbance. Nature is presented throughout the poem as rough and indifferent, constantly threatening the order of men and courtly life. Nature invades and disrupts order in the major events of the narrative, both symbolically and through the inner nature of humanity. This element appears first with the disruption caused by the Green Knight, later when Gawain must fight off his natural lust for Bertilak<U+2019>s wife, and again when Gawain breaks his vow to Bertilak by choosing to keep the green girdle, valuing survival over virtue. Represented by the [[sin]]-stained girdle, nature is an underlying force, forever within man and keeping him imperfect (in a chivalric sense).<ref name = woodsw>Woods, William F. "Nature and the Inner Man in Sir Gawain and the Green Knight". ''The Chaucer Review'', Vol. 36, No. 3, 2002, pp.&nbsp;209<U+2013>227.</ref> In this view, Gawain is part of a wider conflict between nature and chivalry, an examination of the ability of man's order to overcome the chaos of nature.<ref name = rhg>Green, Richard Hamilton. "Gawain's Shield and the Quest for Perfection". ''ELH''. (June 1962) 29.2 pp.&nbsp;121<U+2013>139.</ref>

Several critics have made exactly the opposite interpretation, reading the poem as a comic critique of the Christianity of the time, particularly as embodied in the Christian chivalry of Arthur's court. In its zeal to extirpate all traces of paganism, Christianity had cut itself off from the sources of life in nature and the female. The green girdle represents all the pentangle lacks. The Arthurian enterprise is doomed unless it can acknowledge the unattainability of the ideals of the Round Table, and, for the sake of realism and wholeness, recognize and incorporate the pagan values represented by the Green Knight.<ref> This interpretation was first advanced by John Speirs in ''Scrutiny'', vol.XVI, iv, 1949 (incorporated in his ''Medieval English Poetry: The Non-Chaucerian Tradition'', rev.ed. 1962. Similar interpretations were later offered by Francis Berry in ''The Pelican Guide to English Literature: The Age of Chaucer'', 1954; Goldhurst, "The Green and the Gold: The Major Theme of ''Sit Gawain and the Green Knight'', ''College English'', Nov. 1958; A.C, Spearing, ''The Gawain-Poet: A Critical Study'', 1970; W. A. Davenport, ''The Art of the Gawain-Poet'', 1978; J. Tambling, "A More Powerful Life: ''Sir Gawain and the Green Knight''", ''Haltwhistle Quarterly'' 9, 1981; and K. Sagar, "Sir Gawain and the Green Girdle", in his ''Literature and the Crime Against Nature'', 2005.</ref>

===Games===
The word ''gomen'' ([[game]]) is found 18 times in ''Gawain''. Its similarity to the word ''gome'' ([[man]]), which appears 21 times, has led some scholars to see men and games as centrally linked. Games at this time were seen as tests of worthiness, as when the Green Knight challenges the court's right to its good name in a "Christmas game".<ref name = game /> The "game" of exchanging gifts was common in [[Germanic culture]]s. If a man received a gift, he was obliged to provide the giver with a better gift or risk losing his honour, almost like an exchange of blows in a fight (or in a "beheading game").<ref>Harwood, Britton J. "Gawain and the Gift", ''PMLA''. (1991) 106.3 pp.&nbsp;483<U+2013>99.</ref> The poem revolves around two games: an exchange of beheading and an exchange of winnings. These appear at first to be unconnected. However, a victory in the first game will lead to a victory in the second. Elements of both games appear in other stories; however, the linkage of outcomes is unique to ''Gawain''.<ref name = norton /><ref name = Tolkien>''Sir Gawain and the Green Knight'', Edited J.R.R. Tolkien and E.V. Gordon, revised Norman Davis, 1925. introduction, xv. ASIN B000IPU84U</ref>

===Times and seasons===
Times, dates, seasons, and cycles within ''Gawain'' are often noted by scholars because of their symbolic nature. The story starts on New Year's Eve with a beheading and culminates on the next New Year's Day. Gawain leaves Camelot on [[All Saints Day]] and arrives at Bertilak's castle on [[Christmas Eve]]. Furthermore, the Green Knight tells Gawain to meet him at the Green Chapel in "a year and a day"<U+2014>a period of time seen often in medieval literature.<ref name = year/> Some scholars interpret the yearly cycles, each beginning and ending in winter, as the poet's attempt to convey the inevitable fall of all things good and noble in the world. Such a theme is strengthened by the image of [[Trojan War|Troy]], a powerful nation once thought to be invincible which, according to the ''[[Aeneid]]'', fell to the Greeks due to pride and ignorance. The Trojan connection shows itself in the presence of two virtually identical descriptions of Troy's destruction. The poem's first line reads: "Since Troy's assault and siege&nbsp;<U+2026>" and the final stanzaic line (before the bob and wheel) is "After the siege and assault of Troy".<ref name = christian>Clark, S. L., and Julian N. Wasserman. "The Passing of the Seasons and the Apocalyptic in ''Sir Gawain and the Green Knight''". ''South Central Review''. (1986) 3.1 pp.&nbsp;5<U+2013>22.</ref>

==Symbolism==
===Significance of the colour green===
[[Image:Michael Pacher 004.jpg|thumb|200px|right|In the 15th-century ''[[Saint Wolfgang]] and the Devil'' by [[Michael Pacher]], the [[Devil]] is green. Poetic contemporaries such as [[Geoffrey Chaucer|Chaucer]] also drew connections between the colour green and the devil, leading scholars to draw similar connections in readings of the Green Knight.<ref>Robertson, D.W. Jr. "Why the Devil Wears Green". ''Modern Language Notes''. (November 1954) 69.7 pp.&nbsp;470<U+2013>472.</ref>]]
Given the varied and even contradictory interpretations of the colour [[green]], its precise meaning in the poem remains ambiguous. In [[English folklore]] and literature, green was traditionally used to symbolise nature and its associated attributes: fertility and rebirth. Stories of the medieval period also used it to allude to love and the base desires of man.<ref>Chamberlin, Vernon A. "Symbolic Green: A Time-Honored Characterizing Device in Spanish Literature".

===Green Knight===
{{main|Green Knight}}
Scholars have puzzled over the Green Knight's symbolism since the discovery of the poem. He could be a version of the [[Green Man]], a mythological being connected with nature in [[medieval art]], a [[Christian]] symbol, or the [[Devil]] himself. British medieval scholar [[C. S. Lewis]] said the character was "as vivid and concrete as any image in literature" and [[J. R. R. Tolkien]] said he was the "most difficult character" to interpret in ''Sir Gawain''. His major role in Arthurian literature is that of a judge and tester of knights, thus he is at once terrifying, friendly, and mysterious.<ref name = knight>Besserman, Lawrence.

However, there is a possibility, as Alice Buchanan has argued, that the color green is erroneously attributed to the Green Knight due to the poet's mistranslation or misunderstanding of the Irish word 'glas', which could either mean gray or green. In the Death of Curoi (one of the Irish stories from Bricriu's Feast), Curoi stands in for Bertilak, and is often called "the man of the gray mantle". Though the words usually used for gray in the Death of Curoi are 'lachtna' or 'odar', roughly meaning milk-colored and shadowy respectively, in later works featuring a green knight, the word 'glas' is used and may have been the basis of misunderstanding.<ref>{{cite journal|first=Alice|last=Buchanan|title=The Irish Framework of Sir Gawain and the Green Knight|journal=PLMA|volume=47|issue=No. 2|date=June, 1932|pages=315<U+2013>338}}</ref>

===Girdle===
:''See also: [[Girdle#Girdle in literature|Girdle in literature]]''
The girdle<U+2019>s symbolic meaning, in ''Sir Gawain and the Green Knight'', has been construed in a variety of ways. Interpretations range from sexual in nature to spiritual. Those who argue for the sexual inference view the girdle as a "sexual trophy<U+201D><ref>. Friedman, Albert B. Morgan le Fay in Sir Gawain and the Green Knight. Medieval Academy of America. Speculum, Vol. 35, No. 2, 1960</ref>. However, it is not entirely clear who the <U+201C>winner<U+201D> is: Sir Gawain or Lady Bertilak. The girdle is given to Gawain by Lady Bertilak in order to keep him safe when he confronts the Green Knight. When Lord Bertilak returns home from his hunting trip, Gawain does not reveal the girdle to his host but, instead, hides it. This introduces the spiritual interpretation, that Gawain<U+2019>s acceptance of the girdle is a sign of his faltering faith in God, at least in the face of death<ref>Berger, Sidney E. "Gawain's Departure from the Peregrinatio". Morgantown: West Virginia University Press, 1985. </ref>. To some, the Green Knight is Christ, who overcomes death, while Gawain is the Every Christian, who in his struggles to faithfully follow Christ, chooses the easier path. In ''Sir Gawain'', the easier choice is the girdle, which promises what Gawain most desires. Faith in God, alternatively, requires one<U+2019>s acceptance that what one most desires does not always coincide with what God has planned. It is arguably best to view the girdle not as an either- or- situation, but as a complex, multi-faceted symbol that acts to test Gawain in more ways than one.  While Gawain is able to resist Bertilak<U+2019>s wife<U+2019>s sexual advances, he is unable to resist the powers of the girdle. Gawain is operating under the laws of chivalry which, evidently, have rules that can contradict each other. In the story of ''Sir Gawain'', Gawain finds himself torn between doing what a damsel asks (accepting the girdle) and keeping his promise (returning anything given to him while his host is away)<ref>Burrow, J.A. A Reading of Sir Gawain and the Green Knight. London: Kegan Paul Ltd., 1965</ref>. Ultimately, however, it is not the laws of chivalry that fail him but his own resolve. It is inconsequential that Gawain is bound by honor to accept the girdle because the reader knows that Gawain does so for his own reasons. His fear of death and failure drive him to accept, and then hide, the girdle. It is fitting that at the end of the story, Gawain returns to Camelot wearing the girdle as a token of his shame. While King Arthur decrees that all his knights shall wear green sashes in recognition of Gawain<U+2019>s adventure, perhaps, in part, this decision also stems from a recognition that ultimately, they are all one in being human first, and knights second.

===Pentangle===
{{see also|Pentagram}}
[[Image:Gold_pentagram_on_red.png|right|thumb|180px|The pentangle on Gawain's shield is described as gold on a red background]]
The [[Pentagram|pentangle]] on Gawain's shield is seen by many critics as signifying Gawain's perfection and power over evil.<ref>The poem contains the first recorded use of the word ''pentangle'' in English (''Oxford English Dictionary Online'').</ref> The poem contains the only representation of such a symbol on Gawain's shield in the Gawain literature. What is more, the poet uses a total of 46 lines to describe the meaning of the pentangle. No other symbol in the poem receives as much attention or is described in such detail.<ref>Arthur, Ross G. ''Medieval Sign Theory and Sir Gawain and the Green Knight''. Toronto: University of Toronto Press, 1987. pp.&nbsp;22, 26. ISBN 0802057179</ref> The poem describes the pentangle as a symbol of faithfulness and an "endless knot". In line 625, it is described as "a sign by Solomon". [[Solomon]], the third king of [[Israel]], in 10th century B.C. was said to have the mark of the pentagram on his ring, which he received from the [[archangel]] [[Michael (archangel)|Michael]]. The pentagram seal on this ring was said to give Solomon power over [[demons]].<ref>LaBossi<U+00E8>re, Camille R., and [[Jerry Gladson|Gladson, Jerry A.]] "Solomon", in ''A Dictionary of Biblical Tradition in English Literature''. Grand Rapids, Michigan: William B. Eerdmans Publishing Company, 1992 p.&nbsp;722.</ref>

Along these lines, some academics link the Gawain pentangle to magical traditions. In [[Germany]], the symbol was called a ''Drudenfu<U+00DF>'' and was placed on household objects to keep out evil.<ref name = Hulbert>Hulbert, J. R. "Syr Gawayn and the Grene Knyzt (Concluded)". ''Modern Philology''. (April 1916) 13.12 pp.&nbsp;689<U+2013>730.</ref> The symbol was also associated with magical charms which, if recited or written on a weapon, would call forth magical forces. However, concrete evidence tying the magical pentagram to Gawain's pentangle is scarce.<ref name = Hulbert/><ref>Jackson, I. "Sir Gawain's Coat of Arms." ''The Modern Language Review''. (January 1920) 15.1 pp.&nbsp;77<U+2013>79.</ref>

Gawain<U+2019>s pentangle also symbolises the <U+201C>phenomenon of physically endless objects signifying a temporally endless quality.<U+201D><ref>Arthur, pp.&nbsp;33<U+2013>34.</ref> Many poets use the symbol of the circle to show infinity or endlessness, but Gawain<U+2019>s poet insisted on using something more complex. In medieval number theory, the number five is considered a <U+201C>circular number<U+201D>, since it <U+201C>reproduces itself in its last digit when raised to its powers<U+201D>.<ref name= "rossfour">Arthur, p.&nbsp;34.</ref> Furthermore, it replicates itself geometrically; that is, every pentangle has a smaller pentagon that allows a pentangle to be embedded in it and this <U+201C>process may be repeated forever with decreasing pentangles<U+201D>.<ref name= "rossfour"/> Thus, by reproducing the number five, which in medieval number symbolism signified incorruptibility, Gawain's pentangle represents his eternal incorruptibility.<ref>Arthur, p.&nbsp;35.</ref>

===The Lady's Ring===
Gawain's refusal of the Lady Bertilak's ring has major implications for the remainder of the story. While the modern student may tend to pay more attention to the girdle as the eminent object offered by the lady, readers in the time of Gawain would have noticed the significance of the offer of the ring as they believed that rings, and especially the embedded gems, had talismanic properties.<ref name="cooke">{{cite journal|last=Cooke|first=Jessica|date=1998|title=The Lady's 'Blushing' Ring in ''Sir Gawain and the Green Knight''|journal=[[The Review of English Studies]]|volume=49|issue=193|pages=1-8|accessdate=16 March 2010}}</ref> This is especially true of the lady<U+2019>s ring as scholars believe it to be a [[ruby]] or carbuncle, indicated when the Gawain-Poet describes it as a "brygt sunne" (line 1819),<ref>{{cite book|last=Andrew|first=Malcolm|coauthors=Ronald Walrdon|title=The Poems of the Pearl Manuscript|publisher=U of Exter P|location=Exeter|date=1996|pages=273|isbn=0859895149|accessdate=16 March 2010}}</ref> a "fiery sun."<ref>{{cite book|last=Borroff|first=Marie|title=Sir Gawain and the Green Knight, Patience, Pearl: Verse Translations|publisher=Norton|location=New York|date=2001|pages=58|isbn=9780393976588|accessdate=16 March 2010}}</ref> Given the importance of magic rings in Arthurian romance, this remarkable ring would also have been believed to protect the wearer from harm.<ref>Cooke, "The Lady's 'Blushing,'" 2,5.</ref>

===Numbers===
The poet highlights number symbolism to add symmetry and meaning to the poem. For example, three kisses are exchanged between Gawain and Bertilak's wife; Gawain is tempted by her on three separate days; Bertilak goes hunting three times, and the Green Knight swings at Gawain three times with his axe. The number two also appears repeatedly, as in the two beheading scenes, two confession scenes, and two castles.<ref>Howard, Donald R. "Structure and Symmetry in Sir Gawain". ''Speculum''. (July 1964) 39.3 pp.&nbsp;425<U+2013>433.</ref> The five points of the pentangle, the poet adds, represent Gawain's virtues, for he is "faithful five ways and five times each".<ref>''Sir Gawain and the Green Knight'', Book 2, Stanza 27.</ref> The poet goes on to list the ways in which Gawain is virtuous: all five of his senses are without fault; his five fingers never fail him, and he always remembers the [[Rosary#Sorrowful_Mysteries|five wounds of Christ]], as well as the [[Rosary#Joyful_Mysteries|five joys]] of the [[Virgin Mary]]. The fifth five is Gawain himself, who embodies the five moral virtues of the code of [[chivalry]]: "[[friendship]], [[generosity]], [[chastity]], [[courtesy]], and [[piety]]".<ref>Kittredge, p.&nbsp;93.</ref> All of these virtues reside, as the poet says, in the "Endless Knot" of the pentangle, which forever interlinks and is never broken.<ref>''Sir Gawain and the Green Knight'', Book 2, Stanza 28.</ref> This intimate relationship between symbol and faith allows for rigorous allegorical interpretation, especially in the physical role that the shield plays in Gawain<U+2019>s quest. <ref>Mills, M. <U+201C>Christian Significance and Roman Tradition in Sir Gawain and the Green Knight.<U+201D> Critical Studies of Sir Gawain and the Green Knight. Eds. Donald R. Howard & Christian Zacher. 2nd ed. Notre Dame, Indiana: University of Notre Dame Press, 1970. 85-105.</ref> Thus, the poet makes Gawain the epitome of perfection in knighthood through number symbolism.<ref name =stanza/>
<!-- Scholars believe that the poet uses this symbol of fives not only to give insight into the virtues of Gawain, but also to set the stage for the remainder of the poem. Through the five points of the pentangle the reader is presented with the five dilemmas of Sir Gawain. The Green Knight's challenge is the first: known for his valour and courtesy, Gawain would damage his reputation by refusing it. In accepting the challenge of the Green Knight, Gawain enters into his second dilemma. He must escape with both his life and honour intact.<ref>Engelhardt, George J. "The Predicament of Gawain." ''Modern Language Quarterly''. (Sep 1955) 16.3 p.&nbsp;61.</ref> Gawain enters into a bargain with Bertilak which leads to his third dilemma: "Whatever I win in the woods I will give you at eve, and all you have earned you must offer to me."<ref>''Sir Gawain and the Green Knight'', lines&nbsp;1105<U+2013>08.</ref> With a "gift of body",<ref>Engelhardt, George J. "The Predicament of Gawain." ''Modern Language Quarterly''. (Sep 1955) 16.3 p.&nbsp;62.</ref> Gawain is tempted by Bertilak's wife. He cannot exchange this gift with Bertilak, nor can he, a knight of renowned courtesy, refuse it. Gawain must refuse the lady<U+2019>s attempts at [[seduction]], yet he must do so courteously; this dilemma is his fourth. Gawain encounters his fifth dilemma when he accepts the gift of the girdle. He agrees to hide it from Bertilak, yet his bargain with the lord requires him to exchange it. -->

The number five is also found in the structure of the poem itself. ''Sir Gawain'' is 101&nbsp;stanzas long, traditionally organised into four books of 21, 24, 34, and 22&nbsp;stanzas. These divisions, however, have since been disputed; scholars have begun to believe that they are the work of the copyist and not of the poet. The original manuscript features a series of capital letters added after the fact by another scribe, and some scholars argue that these additions were an attempt to restore the original divisions. These letters divide the manuscript into nine parts. The first and last parts are 22&nbsp;stanzas long. The second and second-to-last parts are only one stanza long, and the middle five parts are eleven stanzas long. The number eleven is associated with transgression in other medieval literature (being one more than ten, a number associated with the [[Ten Commandments]]). Thus, this set of five elevens (55 stanzas) creates the perfect mix of transgression and incorruption, suggesting that Gawain is faultless in his faults.<ref name =stanza>Robertson, Michael. "Stanzaic Symmetry in Sir Gawain and the Green Knight". ''Speculum''. (October 1982) 57.4 pp.&nbsp;779<U+2013>785.</ref>

===Wounds===
At the story's climax, Gawain is wounded superficially in the neck by the Green Knight's axe. During the medieval period, the body and the soul were believed to be so intimately connected that wounds were considered an outward sign of inward sin. The neck, specifically, was believed to correlate with the part of the soul related to [[Will (philosophy)|will]], connecting the reasoning part (the head) and the courageous part (the heart). Gawain's sin resulted from using his will to separate reasoning from courage. By accepting the girdle from the lady, he employs reason to do something less than courageous<U+2014>evade death in a dishonest way. Gawain's wound is thus an outward sign of an internal wound. The Green Knight's series of tests shows Gawain the weakness that has been in him all along: the desire to pridefully use his will for personal gain, rather than submitting his will in humility to God. The Green Knight, by engaging with the greatest knight of Camelot, also reveals the moral weakness of pride in all of Camelot, and therefore all of humanity. However, the wounds of Christ, believed to offer healing to wounded souls and bodies, are mentioned throughout the poem in the hope that this sin of prideful "stiffneckedness" will be healed among fallen mortals.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Reichardt|first=Paul F.|date=1984|title=Gawain and the Image of the Wound|journal=PMLA|volume=99|issue=2|pages=154-61}}</ref><ref>Arthur, pp.&nbsp;121<U+2013>123.</ref>

==Interpretations==
===''Gawain'' as medieval romance===
{{see|Order of the Garter|Romance (genre)}}
[[Image:Pettie, The Vigil.jpg|thumb|right|Gawain represented the perfect knight, as a fighter, a lover, and a religious devotee. (''[[The Vigil]]'' by [[John Pettie]], 1884)]]
Many critics argue that ''Sir Gawain and the Green Knight'' should be viewed, above all, as a [[romance (genre)|romance]]. Medieval romances typically recount the marvellous [[adventure]]s of a chivalrous, [[hero]]ic [[knight]], often of super-human ability, who abides by chivalry's strict codes of honour and demeanour, embarks upon a [[quest]] and defeats monsters, thereby winning the favour of a [[Princess lointaine|lady]]. Thus, medieval romances focus not on love and sentiment (as the term "romance" implies today), but on [[adventure novel|adventure]].<ref>Frye, Northrop. ''[[Anatomy of Criticism]]'', p.&nbsp;186. ISBN 0-691-01298-9</ref>

Gawain's function, as medieval scholar Alan Markman says, "is the function of the romance hero&nbsp;<U+2026> to stand as the champion of the human race, and by submitting to strange and severe tests, to demonstrate human capabilities for good or bad action."<ref name = markman/> Through Gawain's adventure, it becomes clear that he is merely human. The reader becomes attached to this human view in the midst of the poem<U+2019>s romanticism, relating to Gawain<U+2019>s humanity while respecting his knightly qualities. Gawain "shows us what moral conduct is. We shall probably not equal his behaviour, but we admire him for pointing out the way."<ref name = markman>Markman, Alan M. "The Meaning of Sir Gawain and the Green Knight". ''PMLA''. (September 1957) 72.4 pp.&nbsp;574<U+2013>586</ref>

In viewing the poem as a chivalric romance, many scholars see it as intertwining chivalric and [[courtly love]] laws under the English [[Order of the Garter]]. The group's motto, 'honi soit qui mal y pense', or "Shamed be he who finds evil here," is written at the end of the poem. Some critics describe Gawain's peers wearing girdles of their own as evidence of the origin of the Order of the Garter. However, in the parallel poem, ''[[The Greene Knight]]'', the lace is white, not green, and is considered the origin of the collar worn by the knights of the Bath, not the Order of the Garter.<ref>''Sir Gawain and the Green Knight'', second edition. Ed. J.R.R. Tolkien and E.V. Gordon, 1925, note to lines 2514ff. ASIN B000IPU84U</ref> The motto on the poem was probably written by a copyist and not by the original author. Still, the connection made by the copyist to the Order is not extraordinary.<ref>''The Norton Anthology of English Literature'', eighth edition, Vol. B. Ed. Stephen Greenblatt. New York, London: W. W. Norton and Co., 2006, p.&nbsp;213 (footnote). ISBN 0393928330</ref>

===Christian interpretations===
[[Image:Adam-und-Eva-1513.jpg|thumb|Scholars have pointed out parallels between the girdle Bertilak's wife offers Gawain, and the fruit [[Eve (Bible)|Eve]] offered to [[Adam (Bible)|Adam]] in the Biblical [[Garden of Eden]]. (''Adam and Eve'' [[Lucas Cranach]], ca. 1513)]]
The poem is in many ways deeply Christian, with frequent references to the fall of Adam and Eve and to Jesus Christ. Scholars have debated the depth of the Christian elements within the poem by looking at it in the context of the age in which it was written, coming up with varying views as to what represents a Christian element of the poem and what does not. For example, some critics compare ''Sir Gawain'' to the other three poems of the ''Gawain'' manuscript. Each has a heavily Christian theme, causing scholars to interpret Gawain similarly. Comparing it to the poem ''Cleanliness'' (also known as ''Purity''), for example, they see it as a story of the [[apocalyptic]] fall of a civilisation, in ''Gawain's'' case, Camelot. In this interpretation, Sir Gawain is like [[Noah]], separated from his society and warned by the Green Knight (who is seen as God's representative) of the coming doom of Camelot. Gawain, judged worthy through his test, is spared the doom of the rest of Camelot. King Arthur and his knights, however, misunderstand Gawain's experience and wear garters themselves. In ''Cleanliness'' the men who are saved are similarly helpless in warning their society of impending destruction.<ref name = christian/>

One of the key points stressed in this interpretation is that salvation is an individual experience difficult to communicate to outsiders. In his depiction of Camelot, the poet reveals a concern for his society, whose inevitable fall will bring about the ultimate destruction intended by God. ''Gawain'' was written around the time of the [[Black Death]] and [[English peasants' revolt of 1381|Peasants' Revolt]], events which convinced many people that their world was coming to an apocalyptic end and this belief was reflected in literature and culture.<ref name = christian/> However, other critics see weaknesses in this view, since the Green Knight is ultimately under the control of Morgan le Fay, usually viewed as a figure of evil in Camelot tales. This makes the knight's presence as a representative of God problematic.<ref name = game>Goodlad, Lauren M. (1987) [http://repositories.cdlib.org/cmrs/comitatus/vol18/iss1/art4 "The Gamnes of Sir Gawain and the Green Knight"], ''Comitatus: A Journal of Medieval and Renaissance Studies'', Vol. 18, Article 4.</ref>

While the character of the Green Knight is usually not viewed as a representation of [[Christ]] in ''Sir Gawain and the Green Knight'', critics do acknowledge a parallel. Lawrence Besserman, a specialist in medieval literature, explains that "the Green Knight is not a figurative representative of Christ. But the idea of Christ's divine/human nature provides a medieval conceptual framework that supports the poet's serious/comic account of the Green Knight's supernatural/human qualities and actions". This duality exemplifies the influence and importance of Christian teachings and views of Christ in the era of the Gawain Poet.<ref name = knight/>

Furthermore, critics note the Christian reference to Christ's crown of thorns at the conclusion of ''Sir Gawain and the Green Knight''. After Gawain returns to Camelot and tells his story regarding the newly acquired green sash, the poem concludes with a brief prayer and a reference to "the thorn-crowned God".<ref>''Sir Gawain and the Green Knight'', line 2529.</ref> Besserman theorises that "with these final words the poet redirects our attention from the circular girdle-turned-sash (a double image of Gawain's "yntrawpe/renoun") to the circular Crown of Thorns (a double image of Christ's humiliation turned triumph)."<ref name = knight/>

Throughout the poem, Gawain encounters numerous trials testing his devotion and faith in Christianity. When Gawain sets out on his journey to find the Green Chapel, he finds himself lost, and only after praying to the [[Virgin Mary]] does he find his way. As he continues his journey, Gawain once again faces anguish regarding his inevitable encounter with the Green Knight. Instead of praying to Mary, as before, Gawain places his faith in the girdle given to him by Bertilak<U+2019>s wife. From the Christian perspective, this leads to disastrous and embarrassing consequences for Gawain as he is forced to reevaluate his faith when the Green Knight points out his betrayal.<ref name="cox">Cox, Catherine.

Retrieved on 22 September 2007.</ref>

An analogy is also made between Gawain<U+2019>s trial and the [[Biblical]] test that [[Adam (Bible)|Adam]] encounters in the [[Garden of Eden]]. Adam succumbs to [[Eve (Bible)|Eve]] just as Gawain surrenders to Bertilak<U+2019>s wife by accepting the girdle.<ref name = "cox"/> Although Gawain sins by putting his faith in the girdle and not confessing when he is caught, the Green Knight pardons him, thereby allowing him to become a better Christian by learning from his mistakes.<ref>Pugh, Tison.

===Feminist interpretations===
[[Image:Lady tempt Gawain.jpg|thumb|150px|right|Lady Bertilak at Gawain's bed (from original manuscript, artist unknown)]]
[[Feminist literary criticism|Feminist literary critics]] see the poem as portraying women's ultimate power over men. Morgan le Fay and Bertilak's wife, for example, are the most powerful characters in the poem<U+2014>Morgan especially, as she begins the game by enchanting the Green Knight. The girdle and Gawain's scar can be seen as symbols of feminine power, each of them diminishing Gawain's masculinity. Gawain's [[misogynist]] passage,<ref>Mills, David. "The Rhetorical Function of Gawain's Antifeminism?" ''Neuphilologische Mitteilungen''. (1970) 71 pp.&nbsp;635<U+2013>4.</ref> in which he blames all of his troubles on women and lists the many men who have fallen prey to women's wiles, further supports the feminist view of ultimate female power in the poem.<ref name = fem>Heng, Geraldine. "Feminine Knots and the Other Sir Gawain and the Green Knight". ''PMLA''. (1991) 106.3 pp.&nbsp;500<U+2013>514.</ref>

In contrast, others argue that the poem focuses mostly on the opinions, actions, and abilities of men. For example, on the surface, it appears that Bertilak<U+2019>s wife is a strong leading character.<ref>Burns, E. Jane. "Courtly Love: Who Needs It? Recent Feminist Work in the Medieval Tradition". ''Signs''. (Autumn 2001) 27.1 pp.&nbsp;23<U+2013>57. Retrieved on 7 September 2007 from

This is not entirely the case, however.

===Postcolonial interpretations===
From 1350 to 1400<U+2014>the period in which the poem is thought to have been written<U+2014>Wales experienced several raids at the hands of the English, who were attempting to colonise the area. The Gawain poet uses a [[English Midlands|North West Midlands]] dialect common on the Welsh-English border, potentially placing him in the midst of this conflict. Patricia Clare Ingham is credited with first viewing the poem through the lens of [[postcolonialism]], and since then a great deal of dispute has emerged over the extent to which colonial differences play a role in the poem. Most critics agree that gender plays a role, but differ about whether gender supports the colonial ideals or replaces them as English and Welsh cultures interact in the poem.<ref name = arner>Arner, Lynn. "The Ends of Enchantment: Colonialism and Sir Gawain and the Green Knight". ''Texas Studies in Literature and Language''. (Summer 2006) 48.2 pp.&nbsp;79<U+2013>101.</ref>

A large amount of critical debate also surrounds the poem as it relates to the bi-cultural political landscape of the time. Some argue that Bertilak is an example of the hybrid Anglo-Welsh culture found on the Welsh-English border. They therefore view the poem as a reflection of a hybrid culture that plays strong cultures off one another to create a new set of cultural rules and traditions. Other scholars, however, argue that historically much Welsh blood was shed well into the 14th century, creating a situation far removed from the more friendly hybridisation suggested by Ingham. To further support this argument, it is suggested that the poem creates an "us versus them" scenario contrasting the knowledgeable civilised English with the uncivilised borderlands that are home to Bertilak and the other monsters that Gawain encounters.<ref name = arner/>

In contrast to this perception of the colonial lands, others argue that the land of Hautdesert, Bertilak<U+2019>s territory, has been misrepresented or ignored in modern criticism. They suggest that it is a land with its own moral agency, one that plays a central role in the story. Bonnie Lander, for example, argues that the denizens of Hautdesert are "intelligently immoral," choosing to follow certain codes and rejecting others, a position which creates a "distinction&nbsp;<U+2026> of moral insight versus moral faith." Lander thinks that the border dwellers are more sophisticated because they do not unthinkingly embrace the chivalric codes but challenge them in a philosophical, and<U+2014>in the case of Bertilak's appearance at Arthur<U+2019>s court<U+2014>literal sense. Lander<U+2019>s argument about the superiority of the denizens of Hautdesert hinges on the lack of self-awareness present in Camelot, which leads to an unthinking populace that frowns on individualism. In this view, it is not Bertilak and his people, but Arthur and his court, who are the monsters.<ref name = lander>Lander, Bonnie.

===Gawain's journey===
[[Image:Hollywell.jpg|thumb|[[Saint Winifred|St. Winifred's]] well in [[Holywell|Holywell, England]], possibly one of Gawain's stopping points on the way to the Green Chapel]]
Several scholars have attempted to find a real-word correspondence for Gawain's journey to the Green Chapel. The [[Anglesey]] islands, for example, are mentioned in the poem. They exist today as a single island off the coast of Wales.<ref>{{cite web | last =Twomey | first =Michael | authorlink = | coauthors = | title =Anglesey and North Wales | work =Travels With Sir Gawain | publisher =Ithaca Univ | date = | url =http://www.ithaca.edu/faculty/twomey/travels/sggk_frameset.htm | format = | doi = | accessdate =2007-06-21 }}</ref> In line 700, Gawain is said to pass the "Holy Head", believed by many scholars to be either [[Holywell]] or the [[Cistercians|Cistercian]] abbey of Poulton in [[Pulford]]. Holywell is associated with the beheading of [[Winefride|Saint Winifred]]. As the story goes, Winifred was a virgin who was beheaded by a local leader after she refused his sexual advances. Her uncle, another saint, put her head back in place and healed the wound, leaving only a white scar. The parallels between this story and Gawain's make this area a likely candidate for the journey.<ref>{{cite web | last =Twomey | first =Michael | authorlink = | coauthors = | title =The Holy Head and the Wirral | work =Travels With Sir Gawain | publisher =Ithaca Univ | date = | url =http://www.ithaca.edu/faculty/twomey/travels/sggk_frameset.htm | format = | doi = | accessdate =2007-06-21 }}</ref>

Gawain's trek leads him directly into the centre of the Pearl Poet's dialect region, where the candidates for the locations of the Castle at Hautdesert and the Green Chapel stand. Hautdesert is thought to be in the area of Swythamley in northwest Midland, as it lies in the writer's dialect area and matches the topographical features described in the poem. The area is also known to have housed all of the animals hunted by Bertilak (deer, boar, fox) in the 14th century.<ref>{{cite web | last =Twomey | first =Michael | authorlink = | coauthors = | title =Hautdesert | work =Travels With Sir Gawain | publisher =Ithaca Univ | date = | url =http://www.ithaca.edu/faculty/twomey/travels/sggk_frameset.htm | format = | doi = | accessdate =2007-06-21 }}</ref> The Green Chapel is thought to be in either [[Lud's Church]] or [[Wetton Mill]], as these areas closely match the descriptions given by the author.<ref>{{cite web | last =Twomey | first =Michael | authorlink = | coauthors = | title =The Green Chapel | work =Travels With Sir Gawain | publisher =Ithaca Univ | date = | url =http://www.ithaca.edu/faculty/twomey/travels/sggk_frameset.htm | format = | doi = | accessdate =2007-06-21 }}</ref>

===Homosexual interpretations===
According to medieval scholar Richard Zeikowitz, the Green Knight represents a threat to [[homosocial]] friendship in his medieval world. Zeikowitz argues that the narrator of the poem seems entranced by the Knight's beauty, homoeroticising him in poetic form. The Green Knight's attractiveness challenges the homosocial rules of King Arthur's court and poses a threat to their way of life. Zeikowitz also states that Gawain seems to find Bertilak as attractive as the narrator finds the Green Knight. Bertilak, however, follows the homosocial code and develops a friendship with Gawain. Gawain's embracing and kissing Bertilak in several scenes thus represents not a homosexual but a homosocial expression. Men of the time often embraced and kissed and this was acceptable under the chivalric code. Still, however, the Green Knight blurs the lines between homosociality and homosexuality, representing the difficulty medieval writers sometimes had in separating the two.<ref>Zeikowitz, Richard E. "Befriending the Medieval Queer: A Pedagogy for Literature Classes." ''College English: Special Issue: Lesbian and Gay Studies/Queer Pedagogies.'' Vol. 65 No. 1  (Sep 2002) pp. 67-80</ref>

Carolyn Dinshaw argues that the poem may have been a response to accusations that [[Richard II of England|Richard II]] had a male lover<U+2014>an attempt to reestablish the idea that heterosexuality was the Christian norm. Around the time the poem was written, the Catholic Church was beginning to express concerns about kissing between males. Many religious figures were trying to make the distinction between strong trust and friendship between males and homosexuality. Still, the Pearl Poet seems to have been simultaneously entranced and repulsed by homosexual desire. In his other poem, ''Cleanness'', he points out several grievous sins, but spends lengthy passages describing them in minute detail. His obsession seems to carry into ''Gawain'' in his descriptions of the Green Knight.<ref name="dinshaw1994">Dinshaw, Carolyn. "A Kiss Is Just a Kiss: Heterosexuality and Its Consolations in Sir Gawain and the Green Knight." ''Diacritics''. Vol. 24 No. 2/3 (Summer 1994) pp. 204-226</ref>

Beyond this, Dinshaw proposes that Gawain can be read as a woman-like figure. He is the passive one in the advances of Lady Bertilak, as well as in his encounters with Lord Bertilak, where he acts the part of a woman in kissing the man. However, while the poem does have homosexual elements, these elements are brought up by the poet in order to establish heterosexuality as the normal lifestyle of Gawain's world. The poem does this by making the kisses between Lady Bertilak and Gawain sexual in nature, but rendering the kisses between Gawain and Lord Bertilak "unintelligible" to the medieval reader. In other words, the poet portrays kisses between a man and a woman as having the possibility of leading to sex, while in a heterosexual world, kisses between a man and a man are portrayed as having no such possibility.<ref name=dinshaw1994/>

==Modern adaptations==
===Books===
[[Image:US1sheet.jpg|thumb|right|''[[Sword of the Valiant]]'' (1984), one of two film adaptations, starring [[Sean Connery]] as the Green Knight]]
In 1925, [[J. R. R. Tolkien|J.R.R. Tolkien]] and [[E. V. Gordon|E.V. Gordon]] published a scholarly edition of the Middle English text of ''Sir Gawain and the Green Knight''; a second edition of this text was prepared by Norman Davis and published in 1967. The book, featuring a text in Middle English with extensive scholarly notes, is frequently confused with the translation into Modern English that Tolkien prepared, along with translations of ''Pearl'' and ''Sir Orfeo'', late in his life.<ref>{{cite book|last=Tolkien|first=J.R.R.|title=Sir Gawain and the Green Knight, Pearl, and Sir Orfeo|editor=Christopher Tolkien|publisher=Random House|date=1980|isbn=9780345277602}}</ref> Many editions of the latter work, first published in 1975, shortly after his death, list Tolkien on the cover as author rather than translator.<ref>{{cite book|last=White|first=Michael|title=Tolkien: A Biography|publisher=New American Library|date=2003|isbn=0-451-21242-8}}</ref>{{pagenumber}} In 2007, [[Simon Armitage]], a native of the Gawain poet's dialect region, published a translation which attracted attention in the US and the United Kingdom,<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/16/books/review/Hirsch-t.html|title=A Stranger in Camelot |last=Hirsch|first=Edward|date=16 December 2007|publisher=[[The New York Times]]|pages=7.1|accessdate=16 March 2010}}</ref> and was published in the US by [[W.

===Opera===
''Sir Gawain and the Green Knight'' was first adapted as an opera in 1978 by the composer [[Richard Blackford]] on commission from the village of [[Blewbury]], Oxfordshire. The libretto was written for the adaptation by the children's novellist John Emlyn Edwards. The Opera in six scenes was subsequently recorded by DECCA between March and June 1979 and released on the 'ARGO' Label <ref>ARGO ZK 85: Sir Gawain and the Green Knight; an opera in six scenes by Richard Blackford. The DECCA Record Company Ltd. Argo Division, 115 Fulham Road, London, SW3 6RR: 1979.</ref> in November 1979. 

''Sir Gawain and the Green Knight'' was adapted into an opera called ''[[Gawain (opera)|Gawain]]'' by [[Harrison Birtwistle]], first performed in 1991. Birtwistle's opera was praised for maintaining the complexity of the poem while translating it into lyric, musical form.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Bye|first=Anthony|date=May 1991|title=Birtwistle's Gawain|journal=[[The Musical Times]]|volume=132|issue=1779|pages=231-33}}</ref> Another operatic adaptation is Lynne Plowman's ''Gwyneth and the Green Knight'', first performed in 2002. This opera uses ''Sir Gawain'' as the backdrop but refocuses the story on Gawain's female squire, Gwyneth, who is trying to become a knight.<ref>{{cite web | last = | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = Opera&nbsp;<U+2014> Gwyneth and the Green Knight | work = | publisher = lynneplowman.co.uk | date = | url = http://www.lynneplowman.co.uk/gwyneth.htm | format = | doi = | accessdate = 2007-11-03}}</ref> Plowman's version was praised for its approachability, as its target is the family audience and young children, but criticised for its use of modern language and occasional preachy nature.<ref>{{cite web| last = Kimberley| first = Nick | title = Classical: The footstomping way to repay a sound investment| publisher = The Independent on Sunday| date = May 11, 2003| url = http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4159/is_20030511/ai_n12739605/pg_1| accessdate = 2008-01-26}}</ref>

===Film===
The poem has been adapted to film twice: first as ''[[Gawain and the Green Knight (1973)|Gawain and the Green Knight]]'' in 1973<ref>{{cite web | last = | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = Gawain and the Green Knight (1973) | work = | publisher =imdb | date = | url = http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0070093/ | format = | doi = | accessdate = 2007-04-13}}</ref> and again in 1984 as ''[[Sword of the Valiant: The Legend of Sir Gawain and the Green Knight]]'', featuring [[Miles O'Keeffe]] as Gawain and [[Sean Connery]] as the Green Knight.<ref>{{cite web | last = | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = Sword of the Valiant: The Legend of Sir Gawain and the Green Knight (1984) | work = | publisher =imdb | date = | url = http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0084750/ | format = | doi = | accessdate = 2007-04-13}}</ref> The 1973 version has been criticised for deviating from the plot. Gawain, for example, has an adventure which is not a part of the poem between the time he leaves Camelot and the time he arrives at Bertilak's castle. Also, Bertilak and the Green Knight are never connected.<ref>Mills, Maldwyn. "Review." ''The Yearbook of English Studies.'' (1991) Vol. 21. pp.&nbsp;336<U+2013>337.</ref> There have been at least two television adaptations, ''Gawain and the Green Knight'' in 1991<ref>{{cite web | last = | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = Gawain and the Green Knight (1991) (TV) | work = | publisher =imdb | date = | url = http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0387245/ | format = | doi = | accessdate = 2007-04-13}}</ref> and the animated ''Sir Gawain and the Green Knight'' in 2002.<ref>{{cite web | last = | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = Sir Gawain and the Green Knight (2002) (TV) | work = | publisher =imdb | date = | url = http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0846790/ | format = | doi = | accessdate = 2007-04-13}}</ref>
