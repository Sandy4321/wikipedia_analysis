[[Image:Nervous Witch 20.gif|350px|thumb|''"The Nervous Witch"'': a [[Tract (literature)|tract]] written by fundamentalist [[Jack Chick]], depicting the purportedly occult dangers of the ''Harry Potter'' series.]]
'''Religious debates over the Harry Potter series''' by [[J. K. Rowling]] stem largely from [[religious]] [[conservative]]s who assert that the ''[[Harry Potter]]'' stories contain [[occult]] or even [[Satanism|Satanic]] subtexts. This opposition crosses many religious lines, with [[Protestant]], [[Catholic]] and [[Orthodox Christianity|Orthodox]] [[Christians]] and [[Shia]] and [[Sunni]] [[Muslims]] all arguing against the series.   

In the [[United States]], calls for the books to be banned from schools have led occasionally to widely publicised legal challenges, usually on the grounds that [[witchcraft]] is a government-recognised religion and that to allow the books to be held in public schools violates the [[separation of church and state]] mandated by the [[United States Constitution]]. Religious opposition has also surfaced in other nations. The Orthodox authorities of [[Greece]] and [[Bulgaria]] have led campaigns against the series, and members of the [[Vatican]] heirarchy have also voiced opposition. The books have been banned in the [[United Arab Emirates]] and criticised in the [[Iranian]] state-run press. In [[Pakistan]], it is possible that it may have inspired an attempted terrorist attack. 

Responses to these claims have come from multiple corners, both religious and secular. Both Christians and non-Christians have asserted that the magic in ''Harry Potter'' bears little resemblance to the magic of "real life" witchcraft or occultism, and more to the mechanical, fairy-tale magic of ''[[Cinderella]]'', ''[[Snow White]]'' and other fairy tales, and also to the works of [[CS Lewis]] and [[JRR Tolkien]], both authors frequently endorsed by Christians.<ref name=Olsen>{{cite web|title=Opinion Roundup: Positive About Potter|author=Ted Olsen|url=http://www.cesnur.org/recens/potter_010.htm|accessdate=2007-07-06}}</ref> Far from promoting a particular religion, some argue,<ref name=Olsen /> the ''Harry Potter'' novels go out of their way to avoid discussing religion at all. However, the books' author, [[JK Rowling]] describes herself as a practicing Christian and many have noted the overtly Christian references she includes in the final ''Harry Potter'' novel, ''[[Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows]]''.  

==Christian responses==
===Evangelical responses===
Much of the criticism is from [[Evangelicalism|Evangelical Christian]] groups, especially those of a [[Fundamentalist Christianity|fundamentalist]] tendency, who believe the series' alleged [[paganism|pagan]] imagery is dangerous to their children. Paul Hetrick, spokesman for [[Focus on the Family]], an American [[Evangelicalism|Evangelical]] Christian group based in [[Colorado Springs]], outlined the reasons for his opposition to them: "[They contain] some powerful and valuable lessons about love and courage and the ultimate victory of good over evil; however, the positive messages are packaged in a medium <U+2014> [[witchcraft]] <U+2014> that is directly denounced in Scripture."<ref name="Harry Potter expelled from school">{{cite news|url=http://www.cesnur.org/recens/potter_06.htm|publisher=Denver Rocky Mountain News|title=Harry Potter expelled from school|date=1999-11-06|last=Kurtz|first=Holly}}</ref> Accordingly, ''Harry Potter'' has been the subject of at least three local [[book burning]]s.<ref>

A common assertion among Christians is that ''Harry Potter'' promotes the religion of [[Wicca]], and so keeping them in public schools violates the [[separation of religion and state]] mandated by the [[United States Constitution]].<ref name="Harry Potter expelled from school" />  In her response to [[Laura Mallory]]'s court case, education attorney Victoria Sweeny said that if schools were to remove all books containing reference to [[witches]], they would have to ban ''[[Macbeth]]'' and ''[[Cinderella]]''.<ref>{{cite web|title=Ban Harry Potter or face more school shootings|work=The Daily Mail|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/pages/live/articles/news/worldnews.html?in_article_id=408490&in_page_id=1811|year=2006|accessdate=2007-06-07}}</ref> 

[[Jeremiah Films]], a low-budget Christian video company largely known for its  ''[[Clinton Chronicles]]'' release, also released a DVD entitled ''[[Harry Potter: Witchcraft Repackaged]].'' which stated that "Harry's world says that drinking dead animal blood gives power, a satanic human sacrifice and Harry's powerful blood brings new life, demon possession is not spiritually dangerous, and that passing through fire, contacting the dead, and conversing with ghosts, others in the spirit world, and more, is normal and acceptable."<ref name="Harry Potter: Witchcraft Repackaged">{{cite web|url=http://www.chick.com/catalog/videos/0127.asp|publisher=Chick Publications|title=Harry Potter: Witchcraft Repackaged|accessdate=2007-03-13|first=Caryl|last=Matrisciana}}</ref> 

In 2001, Evangelical journalist [[Richard Abanes]], who has written several books arguing against cults, new religions, and [[Mormonism]], published a polemical text that made similar allegations to the video: ''[[Harry Potter and the Bible: The Menace Behind the Magick]]''. Later editions incorporated comparisons and contrasts between ''Harry Potter'' and the more overtly Christian works of [[CS Lewis]] and [[JRR Tolkien]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Richard Abanes books|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?as_auth=Richard+Abanes&ots=QRjqGmCSij&sa=X&oi=print&ct=title|accessdate=2007-08-22}}</ref>    In an interview with CBN.com, Abaines remarked that, "One of the easiest ways to know whether a fantasy book or film has real world magick in it is to just ask a simple question: "Can my child find information in a library or bookstore that will enable them to replicate what they are seeing in the film or the book?" If you go to The ''Chronicles of Narnia'' and ''The Lord of the Rings'' what you see in, story magic and imagination, it is not real. You can<U+2019>t replicate it. But if you go to something like ''Harry Potter'', you can find references to astrology, clairvoyance, and numerology. It takes seconds to go into a bookstore or library and get books on that and start investigating it, researching it, and doing it."<ref>{{cite web|title=Harry Potter: Harmless Christian Novel or Doorway to the Occult?|author= Belinda Elliott|work=CBN.com|url=http://www.cbn.com/spirituallife/OnlineDiscipleship/HarryPotterControversy/elliott_RichardAbanes.aspx|accessdate=2007-09-28}}</ref>
[[Image:Harrypottersatan.gif|thumb|200 px|Image from spoof newspaper ''[[The Onion]]'', which jokingly proclaimed that ''Harry Potter'' was leading children to Satanism.]] This religious fear has inspired at least two internet [[urban legend]]s, both inspired by satires unintentionally taken seriously. In 2001, ''[[The Onion]]'', an American spoof magazine that satirises pop culture phenomena, wrote an article entitled, "Harry Potter Sparks Rise in Satanism Among Children", which said, with obvious irony, that the High Priest of Satanism had described Harry Potter as <U+201C>an absolute godsend to our cause."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://web.archive.org/web/20000815214418/http://www.theonion.com/onion3625/harry_potter.html|publisher=[[The Onion]]|title=Harry Potter Sparks Rise in Satanism in Children|date=2000-07-26|accessdate=2007-03-13}}</ref> Regardless, this article was copied into a chain letter and circulated among Christians as "proof" of their views.<ref>{{cite web|title=Snopes.com: Harry Potter|url=http://www.snopes.com/humor/iftrue/potter.asp|year=200|accessdate=2007-03-26}}</ref> The following year the [[Canadian]] right wing daily the ''[[National Post]]'' released a similar spoof article in its satirical column, ''Post Morten'',  saying that "''Rowling -- or, as she shall henceforth be referred to and credited as, Mrs. J. K. Satan -- said that as she sat in a coffee shop one grey day, wondering what to do with her empty, aimless life, it hit her: "I'll give myself, body and soul, to the Dark Master. And in return, he will give me absurd wealth and power over the weak and pitiful of the world. And he did!"''" This article too was copied into a chain letter and released as "truth" onto the web.<ref>{{cite web|title=Harry Potter Author Admits She's an Avowed Satanist-Fiction!|url=http://www.truthorfiction.com/rumors/j/jkrowlings.htm|year=2002|work=Truthorfiction.com|accessdate=2007-09-10}}</ref>

Not all evangelical Christians consider ''Harry Potter'' necessarily evil. Polls indicate that this position remains a minority view; 7% of Americans who have heard of the books have a negative view of them, with 52% having a positive opinion and the remainder unsure.<ref>Jones, Jeffrey M.

Evangelical author [[Connie Neal]], in her books, ''What's a Christian to Do with Harry Potter?'',<ref>{{cite web|title=''What's A Christian to Do with Harry Potter?''

The leading American evangelical magazine ''[[Christianity Today]]'' published a strong editorial in favor of the books in January 2000, calling the series a "Book of Virtues" and averring that although "<nowiki>[m]</nowiki>odern witchcraft is indeed an ensnaring, seductive false religion that we must protect our children from", this does not represent the Potter books, which have "wonderful examples of compassion, loyalty, courage, friendship, and even self-sacrifice".<ref>Editorial (Jan. 10, 2000). [http://www.ctlibrary.com/2577 "Why We Like Harry Potter"]. ''Christianity Today''.</ref> However, that same year, Jacqui Komschlies wrote an article in that same magazine comparing ''Harry Potter'' to "rat poison mixed with orange soda," and said, "We're taking something deadly from our world and turning it into what some are calling 'merely a literary device.'"<ref>{{cite web|title=Matters of Opinion: The Perils of Harry Potter|author=Jacqui Komschlies|work=Christianity Today|url=http://www.ctlibrary.com/ct/2000/october23/34.113.html|year=2000|accessdate=2007-07-07}}</ref>

Inasmuch, since 2001, the magazine ''[[Adventist Review]]'' published different articles to address this controversy.<ref>{{cite web|title=Harry Potter's Back, How Should Christians Respond?|authors=Various|work=Adventist Review|url=http://www.adventistreview.org/article.php?id=1272|year=2007|accessdate=2007-07-16}}</ref>

===Catholic responses===
The [[Holy See|Vatican]] has taken no official position on the books. However, various officials of the [[Roman Curia]], the [[Catholic Church hierarchy|hierarchy]], and other official bodies have presented mixed views on the subject. 

In 2003, Fr. Peter Fleetwood, an official of the [[Pontifical Council for Culture]],<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/pontifical_councils/interelg/documents/rc_pc_interelg_doc_20030203_press-conf-new-age_en.html | title=Presentations of the Holy See's document on "New Age" | author=[[Paul Cardinal Poupard]] | date=2003 | publisher=[[Pontifical Council for Culture]] | accessdate=2007-07-27 }}</ref> made comments supportive of the novels during a press conference announcing the release of ''Jesus Christ the Bearer of the Water of Life &mdash; A Christian reflection on the "New Age"''. In response to a question asking if the magic presented in the ''Harry Potter'' series should be considered in the same light as some [[New Age]] practices warned against in the document, Fr. Fleetwood stated, "If I have understood well the intentions of Harry Potter's author, they help children to see the difference between good and evil. And she is very clear on this." He added that Rowling is "Christian by conviction, is Christian in her mode of living, even in her way of writing."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://film.guardian.co.uk/news/story/0,,888638,00.html|publisher=The Guardian|title=Catholic church stands up for Harry Potter|date=2003-02-04}}</ref> This comment was seized on by the media as an endorsement of the novels from the Catholic Church, and by extension, the Pope at that time, [[John Paul II]],<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/cbbcnews/hi/world/newsid_2722000/2722445.stm|publisher=BBC Newsround|title=Pope sticks up for Potter books|date=2003-02-03}}</ref> though there is no evidence that the Pope officially approved of the novels.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.familylifecenter.net/article.asp?artId=146|publisher=LifeSite Newsl|title=Harry Potter Gets Vatican's Blessing?|accessdate=2007-03-13}}</ref>

Also in 2003, the Prefect of the [[Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith]], Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger &mdash; now [[Pope Benedict XVI]] &mdash; received a manuscript of a book critical of the novels from a German author. He stated in a private letter expressing gratitude for the receipt of the book, "It is good that you enlighten people about Harry Potter, because those are subtle seductions, which act unnoticed and by this deeply distort Christianity in the soul, before it can grow properly." He also recommended she send a copy of her book to Father Fleetwood at the Council for Culture. The cardinal later gave the author permission to make his letter public. These letters from the prefect have been used to suggest that the new pontiff is officially opposed to the novels.<ref name="Pope Opposes Harry Potter Novels">{{cite news|url=http://www.lifesite.net/ldn/2005/jul/05071301.html|publisher=LifeSite News|title=Pope Opposes Harry Potter Novels - Signed Letters from Cardinal Ratzinger Now Online|date=2005-07-13|accessdate=2007-03-13}}</ref>

Criticism against the books also comes from the one of the official [[exorcist]]s of the Archdiocese of Rome, Fr. [[Gabriele Amorth]], who believes that, "Behind Harry Potter hides the signature of the king of the darkness, the devil."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/books/devil-in-the-detail-vatican-exorcises-harry-potter/2006/08/31/1156817034534.html|publisher=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]|title=Devil in the detail: Vatican exorcises Harry Potter|date=2006-01-09|accessdate=2007-03-13|last=Morris|first=Linda}}</ref> He further told the ''[[Daily Mail]]'' that the books make a false distinction between black and white magic, while, in reality, the distinction "does not exist, because magic is always a turn to the devil." Amorth believes that the books can be a bad influence on children by getting them interested in the occult.

Before the release of ''[[Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince]]'', Msgr. Fleetwood, now with the Council of European Bishops Conferences, gave an interview with [[Vatican Radio]]. In the interview, Fleetwood reaffirmed his positive opinion of the books, and remarked that then&ndash;Cardinal Ratzinger's letters may have been written by a member of the congregation's staff and simply signed by the prefect. He also states that Father Amorth's opinion is just that, a personal opinion by a priest, as is his own.<ref name="Fleetwood transcript">{{cite web | url=http://web.archive.org/web/20050716231953/http://catholicinsider.com/scripts/hp_transcript.php | title=Speak of the Devil...

===Orthodox responses===
In 2002, the [[Greek Orthodox]] authorities in [[Thrace]], [[Greece]], released a statement denouncing the ''Harry Potter'' books as Satanic, saying that they "acquaint people with evil, wizardry, the occult and demonology." The statement also criticised the purported similarities between Harry Potter and [[Jesus Christ]], saying, "It is beyond doubt that Harry was made to resemble a young savior. Upon his birth people try to kill him, he is forever subjected to injustice but always supernaturally manages to prevail and save others. Let us reflect, who else... is held to be the unjustly treated God?"<ref>{{cite web|title=Church: Harry Potter film a font of evil|work=Kathimerini|url=http://www.ekathimerini.com/4dcgi/_w_articles_politics_100021_14/01/2003_25190|year=2003|accessdate=2007-06-15}}</ref> 

In June 2004, soon after a [[Bulgarian people|native Bulgarian]], [[Stanislav Ianevski]], had been cast to portray the character [[Viktor Krum]] in the film adaptation of ''Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire'', the [[Bulgarian Orthodox Church]] printed a front-page article in their official newspaper, claiming that "magic is not a children's game", and that the holy Synod had advised that a church in [[Sofia]], Bulgaria's capital, hold special [[Divine Liturgy|liturgies]] every Thursday to cure those afflicted by spells or possessed by evil spirits. Pamphlets were posted throughout the city, claiming that reciting a ''Harry Potter'' spell "is as if you are praying to evil", and that "God hates magic."<ref>{{cite web|title=Bulgarian church warns against the spell of Harry Potter|author=Clive Leviev-Sawyer|work=Ecumenica News International|url=http://www.eni.ch/articles/display.shtml?04-0394|year=2004|accessdate=2007-06-15}}</ref>

However, the Russian Orthodox apologist deacon Andrei Kuraev argued in his 2003 book ''Harry Potter in the Church: Between an Anathema and a Smile'' that the Harry Potter books are not so dangerous. His arguments include the books' similarity with traditional fairy-tales and literary classics such as the [[Iliad]] which no-one calls 'satanic'; the difference between the books' magic and real occult practices; the presence of Christian values such as humility, love, sacrifice and choosing the right over the easy.
He quotes other notable Orthodox priests and church officials such as M. Kozlov and S. Pravdoliubov as supporting his position.<ref><U+0414><U+0438><U+0430><U+043A><U+043E><U+043D> <U+0410><U+043D><U+0434><U+0440><U+0435><U+0439> <U+041A><U+0443><U+0440><U+0430><U+0435><U+0432>. <U+0413><U+0430><U+0440><U+0440><U+0438> <U+041F><U+043E><U+0442><U+0442><U+0435><U+0440> <U+0432> <U+0426><U+0435><U+0440><U+043A><U+0432><U+0438>: <U+043C><U+0435><U+0436><U+0434><U+0443> <U+0430><U+043D><U+0430><U+0444><U+0435><U+043C><U+043E><U+0439> <U+0438> <U+0443><U+043B><U+044B><U+0431><U+043A><U+043E><U+0439>.

Also the American academic and Orthodox Christian writer [[John Granger]] has analyzed the literature in a positive light. Granger, a Christian classicist, has also defended the books in his book, ''Looking for God in Harry Potter''.<ref>{{cite web|title=Review: Looking for God in Harry Potter|author=Austin Cline|url=http://atheism.about.com/od/bookreviews/fr/GodHarryPotter.htm|accessdate=2007-05-06}}</ref> Granger argues that the books do not promote the occult because none of the magic is based on summoning any sort of demon or spirit; he contrasts occult ''invocational'' magic (calling up spirit beings to do your bidding) with literature's common ''incantational'' magic (saying a set phrase to use power from an unspecified source). Indeed, says Granger, the themes of love triumphing over death and choosing what is right instead of what is easy are very compatible with Christianity.

===Anglican responses===
In 2000, the Dean of [[Canterbury Cathedral]] refused to allow his church to be filmed as part of [[Hogwarts]] in the ''Harry Potter'' film series, saying that it was unfitting for a Christian church to be used to promote pagan imagery.<ref>{{cite web|title=THE HARRY POTTER<U+2122> BOOKS News in the media: 2000 to 2003|url=http://www.religioustolerance.org/potter4.htm|year=2004|accessdate=2007-06-15}}</ref>  [[Gloucester Cathedral]] agreed to take its place; the Dean of Gloucester, Reverend Nicholas Bury, admitted to being a fan of the books; "I think the book is a marvellous traditional children's story and excellently written.

Said one honorary chaplain, "Oh yes, there was quite a to-do. There was one particular man, very evangelical, writing in and complaining that it wasn't right for such things to be going on.

Also in 2000, Carol Rookwood, headmistress of [[St Mary's Island, Kent|St Mary's Island]] [[Church of England]] Aided School in [[Chatham, Kent|Chatham]], [[Kent]], banned the books from school grounds, saying that, "The Bible is very clear and consistent in its teachings that wizards, devils and demons exist and are very real, powerful and dangerous, and God's people are told to have nothing to do with them."<ref>{{cite web|title=School bans Harry Potter|work=BBC News|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/education/693779.stm|year=2000|accessdate=2007-06-15}}</ref>

Then-Archbishop of Canterbury [[George Carey]] gave positive remarks about the [[Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (film)|''Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone'' film]] in his New Year Message for 2002, calling it "great fun", and a film that "asks some very real questions" on moral issues.<ref>Carey, George (December 31, 2001).

===Sunni responses===
The books were banned in schools across the [[United Arab Emirates]] (UAE). According to a spokesperson from the education ministry of the UAE government, the books' [[fantasy]] and [[magic]] elements were contrary to [[Islamic]] values. Despite being banned from schools in the Emirates, there are no plans to ban them from bookshops within the country.<ref>{{cite web|title=Emirates ban Potter book|work=BBC News|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/1816012.stm|year=2002|accessdate=2007-07-10}}</ref>

In [[August 2007]], police in [[Karachi]], [[Pakistan]] discovered and defused a [[car bomb]] located outside a shopping centre where, hours later, the final ''Harry Potter'' novel was scheduled to go on sale. The book launch was postponed in response. A local police superintendent commented that, "We are not sure so far whether the target of the bombing was the book launch, but the connection cannot be ruled out."<ref>{{cite web|title=Terrorist attack at the Potter book launch site foiled in Pakistan|work=Deutsche Presse Agentur|year=2007|url=http://www.nationmultimedia.com/2007/07/21/headlines/headlines_30041840.php|accessdate=2007-09-10}}</ref>

===Shia responses===
While the ''Harry Potter'' books are available for sale in [[Iran]], an editorial in the [[July 26]], [[2007]] edition of the far-right state-run newspaper ''[[Kayhan]]'', which has ties to Iran's Supreme Leader, the [[Ayatollah]] [[Ali Khamenei]], criticized Iran's Culture and Islamic Guidance Ministry for approving the distribution of the final ''Harry Potter'' novel.<ref>{{cite web|title=Iranian Daily: Harry Potter, Billion-Dollar Zionist Project|work=The Mimri blog|url=http://www.thememriblog.org/blog_personal/en/2269.htm|accessdate=2007-09-10}}</ref>   The editorial claimed that the book, "includes destructive words and sentences which oppose to the values [of the Islamic Republic]", and that  airport security had failed by "[trusting] the American-British publisher which has [[Zionist]] collaborators, such as [[Warner Brothers]]."

In 1999, in response to one banning by a school superintendent in [[Zeeland, Michigan|Zeeland]], [[Michigan]], children wrote to their school superintendent, forming clubs and organising petitions, which ultimately formed into an internet site called Muggles for Harry Potter. Eventually the site took on a broader remit as kidSPEAK!, a forum for children to tackle censorship in general.<ref name=kidspeak />

===Laura Mallory===
In September 2005, Laura Mallory, a mother of four children in [[Loganville, Georgia|Loganville]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], attempted to have the ''Harry Potter'' books banned from her children's school library on the grounds that they promoted a religion, [[Wicca]], and thus for a public school library to hold them would violate the separation of church and state.<ref name=timeline>{{cite web|title=Next installment of mom vs. Potter set for Gwinnett court|author=Ben Smith|work=Atlanta Journal-Constitution|url=http://websleuths.com/forums/archive/index.php/t-49864.html|year=2007|accessdate=2007-06-08}}</ref><ref>{{citation|url=http://msnbc.msn.com/id/15127464/ |title=Georgia mom seeks Harry Potter ban|publisher=[[MSNBC.com]]|date = October 4, 2006}}</ref> On her website, she states, "Harry Potter is being used to teach and promote witchcraft, Wicca, a U.S. [Government] recognized religion, in our schools, classrooms, and to this entire generation."<ref>{{cite web|title=Harry Potter Appeal Update|author=Laura Mallory|url=http://www.hisvoicetoday.org/hpappeal.htm|year=2007|accessdate=2007-05-16}}</ref> Mallory said the books carry "evil themes, witchcraft, demonic activity, murder, evil blood sacrifice, spells and teaching children all of this."

===Sariya Allan===
In July 2006, Sariya Allan, a teaching assistant at Durand Primary School in [[Stockwell]], [[South London]], quit her job after she was suspended for refusing to listen to a seven-year-old pupil read a ''Harry Potter'' book in class. A practising [[Pentecostal]] Christian, she told the girl that "I don't do witchcraft in any form", and that she would be "cursed" if she heard the novel recited. Allan took her dispute with the school to an [[employment tribunal]], citing religious discrimination and claiming for damages.

==Responses to religious allegations==
These arguments have been contested both by Christians and by Wiccans highlighting the dissimilarities between the magic within Wicca and the magic of ''Harry Potter''.  

===Secularism===
Wicca is a religion; adherents believe they derive their power from the deities they pray to, and ''Harry Potter'' does not present magic in such religious terms. Indeed religious practices of any form are absent from the books. In his critical editorial on the books, Focus on the Family's Lindy Beam comments, "The spiritual fault of ''Harry Potter'' is not so much that Rowling is playing to dark supernatural powers, but that she doesn't acknowledge any supernatural powers at all. These stories are not fueled by witchcraft, but by secularism."<ref name=Olsen /> The ''Harry Potter'' books have been lauded by [[atheist]]s and [[secularist]]s for their determinedly non-religious outlook. Mika LaVaque-Manty of the liberal website Left2Right notes, "Religion plays no role in the books. There are no churches, no other religious institutions, nobody prays or meditates, and even funerals are non-religious affairs."<ref>{{cite web|title=J. K. Rowling's modern world|author=Mika LaVaque-Manty|work=Left2Right|url=http://left2right.typepad.com/main/2005/07/j_k_rowlings_mo.html|year=2005|accessdate=2007-05-15}}</ref>  In a July, 2007 article for ''[[Time magazine]]'', [[Lew Grossman]] notes that, "Harry Potter lives in a world free of any religion or spirituality of any kind. He lives surrounded by ghosts but has no one to pray to, even if he were so inclined, which he isn't."<ref>{{cite web|title=Who Dies in Harry Potter?

===Treatment of divination===
Although characters in the books do occasionally employ divinatory practices such as [[scrying]] and [[astrology]], these practices are not integral to the Wiccan religion and are not unique to Wiccans.<ref>{{cite web|title=Six different, unrelated, forms of Witchcraft: Harry Potter to Wicca|work=religioustolerence.org|url=http://www.religioustolerance.org/wic_pott2.htm#so|accessdate=2007-05-15}}</ref> Also, the books tend to treat such practices in a very condescending, tongue-in-cheek manner; the school divination teacher is, according to writer Christine Schoeffer, "a misty, dreamy, dewy charlatan",<ref name=trelawney>{{cite web|publisher=Salon.com| url=http://archive.salon.com/books/feature/2000/01/13/potter/index.html| title=Harry Potter's girl trouble| first= Christine| last=Schoeffer| accessdate=2006-06-20}}</ref> who is ridiculed by the students and staff alike. In the ''Harry Potter'' universe, Schoeffer claims, "the entire intuitive tradition of fortune-telling ... is discredited."<ref name=trelawney />

===Definition of witchcraft===
A number of people, particularly Wiccans, have argued that Christians' accusations that the books promote witchcraft are complicated by the fact that their definition of "witchcraft" tends to lump together many and various spiritualist practices that actually have little in common. A Wiccan review of ''Harry Potter: Witchcraft Repackaged'' criticised its contention that the books promoted Wicca by allegedly depicting "communing with the dead and spirit world, sorcery, curses, occult [[symbology]], black magic [and] demon possession," none of which are part of Wiccan belief.<ref>{{cite web|title=Reviews of the video by Jeremiah Films: "Harry Potter: Witchcraft Repackaged"|work=religioustolerence.org|url=http://www.religioustolerance.org/potter9.htm|accessdate=2007-06-06}}</ref> The website [[religioustolerance.org]] says, in their analysis of Chick's "The Nervous Witch", that the comic's heroine cries that "she got into ''"The Craft"'' (ie Wicca) ''"Through the Harry Potter books! We wanted his powers...so we called for spirit guides. Then they came into us."'' In reality, spirit guides are unrelated to the Witchcraft in the ''Harry Potter'' books and are not sought by Wiccans. They are a [[New Age]] phenomenon."<ref>{{cite web|title=NEGATIVE REVIEWS BY CONSERVATIVE CHRISTIANS TO THE HARRY POTTER<U+2122> BOOKS|work=religioustolerance.org|url=http://www.religioustolerance.org/potter2.htm|year=2000|accessdate=2007-06-10}}</ref>

===Occult vs. fantasy and fairytale magic===
Regardless, statements such as those in ''Witchcraft Repackaged'' that the books depict actual [[occultist]] practices of any kind have been roundly criticised, even by Christians. Christian writer Stephen D. Greydanus writes that the magic of the ''Harry Potter'' novels is not the ritualistic, invocative magic of Wicca or occultism but the same "fantasy" magic practised in the works of [[JRR Tolkien]] and [[CS Lewis]]; "If anything, the magic in Rowling's world is even more emphatically imaginary, even further removed from real-world practices, than that of Tolkien or Lewis; and, like theirs, presents no appreciable risk of direct imitative behaviour."<ref name=Greydanus>{{cite web|title=Harry Potter vs. Gandalf|author=Stephen D. Greydanus|url=http://www.decentfilms.com/sections/articles/magic.html|accessdate=2007-06-06}}</ref>  ''Christianity Today'' columnist [[Charles Colson]] asserts that the magic in ''Harry Potter'' is "purely mechanical, as opposed to occultic. That is, Harry and his friends cast spells, read crystal balls, and turn themselves into animals<U+2014>but they don't make contact with a supernatural world. [It's not] the kind of real-life witchcraft the Bible condemns."<ref name= Olsen /> As one Catholic reader noted on her blog, "J.K. Rowling's creation is an imagined, alternate universe in which "wizards" and "witches" are people who are born with the ability to do magical things. They do not call upon Satan or demons and they do not try to tame occult powers. There are no "occult" powers, because there is not a "source" for their kind of magic. "Magical" in Harry's world, is simply the way some people are born."<ref>{{cite web|title=The Mystery of Harry Potter: A Catholic Family Guide|author=love2learn blog|url=http://love2learnblog.blogspot.com/2007/08/mystery-of-harry-potter-catholic-family.html|year=2007|accessdate=2007-09-18}}</ref>

Connie Neal has commented that, "there are 64 real references to witchcraft in the first four ''Harry Potter'' books, but you have to see them in context to know they are not teaching witchcraft or sorcery. Many of the detractors who have actually read the books already have made up their mind that ''Harry Potter'' is evil before they read. They have taken a magnifying glass and picked at the books, using literary reductionism to find what they want to find. You can pick up [[Dickens]]'s ''A Christmas Carol'' and do the same thing that these people have done with ''Harry Potter''; it is ridiculous."<ref name=Neal>{{cite web|title=Harry Potter and the Christian Cauldron|work=The Rutherford Institute|url=http://www.rutherford.org/Oldspeak/Articles/Religion/oldspeak-harry_potter2.asp|accessdate=2007-07-06}}</ref>

In 2001, [[Massimo Introvigne]], an Italian expert in emerging religious movements, criticised the Fundamentalist impulse to distrust fantasy. "Fundamentalists reject, or even burn, all products of contemporary popular culture, because their modes of production, languages and styles are not intrinsically Christian. . . Most children understand that magic is used in fairy tales and juvenile supernatural fiction as a century-old language, and that this is fiction, not reality. If we dismiss the use of magic as a language, we should at least be fundamentalist to the bitter end, and go against "Mary Poppins," "Peter Pan" and "Sleeping Beauty," and insist that Cinderella puts a burkha on."<ref>{{cite web|title=

===Rowling and the Inklings===
Several Christian writers have compared Rowling to the [[Inklings]], a group that included [[C. S. Lewis]] and [[J. R. R. Tolkien]], who explored Christian themes and morality in their books.<ref>{{cite web|title=In Defense of Harry Potter|author=Mark Gudgel|work=Relevant Magazine|url=http://www.relevantmagazine.com/pc_article.php?id=7069|accessdate=2007-06-23}}</ref> Dave Kopel, citing John Granger's book, draws comparisons between Rowling's and Lewis's common usage of Christian symbols, such as lions, unicorns and stags. He compares the work to Lewis's Christian allegory (This quote predates Rowling's revelation that Ginny Weasley's full name is Ginevra, not Virginia):<ref>{{cite web|title=Some Random Facts About The Weasley Family|author=JK Rowling|work=jkrowing.com|url=http://www.jkrowling.com/textonly/en/extrastuff_view.cfm?id=7|accessdate=2007-07-10}}</ref> "In the climax of ''Chamber of Secrets'', Harry descends to a deep underworld, is confronted by two satanic minions (Voldemort and a giant serpent), is saved from certain death by his faith in Dumbledore (the bearded God the Father/Ancient of Days), rescues the virgin (<!-- This is a quote; do not alter it --->Virginia<!-- This is a quote; do not alter it--> ''[sic]'' Weasley), and ascends in triumph. It's ''[[Pilgrim's Progress]]'' for a new audience."<ref>{{cite web|title=Deconstructing Rowling|author=Dave Kopel|work=National Review|url=http://www.nationalreview.com/kopel/kopel062003.asp|year=2003|accessdate=2007-06-23}}</ref>        

Other Christian writers compare Rowling negatively to the Inklings. In his essay "Harry Potter vs. Gandalf", Steven D. Greydanus notes that in the works of Tolkien and Lewis, magic is confined to alien realms with their own laws, whereas Rowling's world coexists with our own. "Lewis goes to great lengths to make clear just how dangerous and wrong, how incompatible with Christianity, is any form of attempted magic in our world."<ref name=Greydanus /> John Andrew Murray comments that Rowling's work portrays magic as a natural force to be manipulated, while Lewis and Tolkien portray magic as a gift bestowed by a higher power. "Despite superficial similarities, Rowling's and Lewis' worlds are as far apart as east is from west. Rowling's work invites children to a world where witchcraft is 'neutral' and where authority is determined solely by one's cleverness. Lewis invites readers to a world where God's authority is not only recognized, but celebrated<U+2014>a world that resounds with His goodness and care."<ref name=Neal />

Rowling's attitude toward the Inklings, and to Lewis in particular, has been somewhat ambiguous. In one of her earliest interviews, she claimed that she had a lifelong love of CS Lewis. "Even now, if I was in a room with one of the Narnia books I would pick it up like a shot and re-read it."<ref>{{cite web|title="Harry Potter Charms a Nation."|author=Helena de Bertodano|work=The Daily Telegraph|year=1998|url=http://www.accio-quote.org/articles/1998/0798-telegraph-bertodano.html|accessdate=2007-07-06}}</ref>  However, in later interviews she claimed, "I adored them when I was a child. I got so caught up I didn't think CS Lewis was especially preachy. Reading them now I find that his subliminal message isn't very subliminal."<ref> {{cite web | author= Renton, Jennie| title="The story behind the Potter legend: JK Rowling talks about how she created the Harry Potter books and the magic of Harry Potter's world"|work=Sydney Morning Herald| url=http://www.accio-quote.org/articles/2001/1001-sydney-renton.htm

As regards Tolkien, Rowling said in 2000 that "I didn't read ''[[The Hobbit]]'' until after the first Harry book was written, though I read ''[[Lord of the Rings]]'' when I was nineteen. I think, setting aside the obvious fact that we both use myth and legend, that the similarities are fairly superficial. Tolkien created a whole new mythology, which I would never claim to have done. On the other hand, I think I have better jokes."<ref>{{cite news

==Rowling's response==
J.K. Rowling has repeatedly denied that her books lead children into witchcraft.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.accio-quote.org/articles/2001/1201-bbc-hpandme.htm|title=Harry Potter and Me|publisher=BBC|date=2001-12-28|accessdate=2007-03-13}}</ref>  In an interview with CNN in 1999, she said:<ref>{{cite web|title=Success of Harry Potter bowls author over|work=cnn.com|url=http://www.accio-quote.org/articles/2001/1201-guardian-yates.htm|year=1999|accessdate=2007-07-07}}</ref>

<blockquote>I absolutely did not start writing these books to encourage any child into witchcraft. I'm laughing slightly because to me, the idea is absurd. I have met thousands of children and not even one time has a child come up to me and said, "Ms Rowling, I'm so glad I've read these books because now I want to be a witch"</blockquote>

"Practicing Wiccans think I'm also a witch," Rowling told ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' in 2000, "I'm not."<ref>{{cite web|title='Fire' Storm|author=Jeff Jensen|work=ew.com|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,85523,00.html|year=2000|accessdate=2007-07-07}}</ref>

In an interview  in  ''Donny &  Marie Show'' in 1999, Rowling said that "You have a perfect right, of course, as every parent does, and I'm a parent, to decide what your child is exposed to. You do not have the right to decide what everyone else's children are exposed to. So that's how I feel about it."<ref name="donnymarie">{{cite web  | last = Osmond  | first = Danny | coauthors = Marie Osmond  | title =Interview of J.K.

Rowling said that to her, the moral significance of the tales seems "blindingly obvious."<ref name=Baltimore>{{cite web|url=http://www.accio-quote.org/articles/2000/1000-vancouversun-wyman.htm|title='You can lead a fool to a book but you can't make them think'|publisher=Vancouver Sun|date=2000-10-26|accessdate=2007-05-01}}</ref> The key for her was the choice between what is right and what is easy, "because that, that is how tyranny is started, with people being apathetic and taking the easy route and suddenly finding themselves in deep trouble."<ref name=Baltimore />

Rowling attended a [[Church of Scotland]] congregation while writing ''Harry Potter'' and her eldest daughter, Jessica, was baptised into that faith.<ref>{{cite web|title=Charmed, I'm Sure|author= Linton Weeks|work=The Washington Post|url=http://www.accio-quote.org/articles/1999/1099-post-weeks.htm|year=1999|accessdate=2007-06-17}}</ref>  When asked if she was a Christian by journalist Max Wyman of the ''[[Vancouver Sun]]'', she replied:<ref name=Baltimore />

<blockquote>Yes, I am, which seems to offend the religious right far worse than if I said I thought there was no God. Every time I've been asked if I believe in God, I've said yes, because I do, but no one ever really has gone any more deeply into it than that, and I have to say that does suit me, because if I talk too freely about that I think the intelligent reader, whether 10 or 60, will be able to guess what's coming in the books.</blockquote>

===Christian allegories in ''Deathly Hallows''===
Though Rowling has yet to publicly elaborate on the Biblical influences in her work, a number of commentators have drawn attention to the Biblical themes and references in her final ''Harry Potter'' novel, ''[[Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows]]''. In an August 2007 issue of ''[[Newsweek]]'', Lisa Miller commented that Harry dies and then comes back to life to save mankind, like Christ. She points out the title of the chapter in which this occurs<U+2014>"King's Cross"<U+2014>a possible allusion to Christ's cross. Also, she outlines the scene in which Harry is temporarily dead, pointing out that it places Harry in a very heaven-like setting where he talks to a father figure "whose supernatural powers are accompanied by a profound message of love." Miller argues that these parallels make it difficult to believe that the basis of the stories is Satanic.<ref>Miller, Lisa. "Christ-like." ''Newsweek.'' Published: 2007-08-06 Vol. 150 Iss. 6 pg. 12 ISSN: 00289604</ref> Jeffrey Weiss adds, in the ''[[Dallas Morning News]]'', that the biblical quote "And the last enemy that shall be defeated is death," featured on the tombstones of Harry's parents, refers to Christ's resurrection.<ref>{{cite web|title=Christian Themes Abound in the Harry Potter books|author=Jeffrey Weiss|work=Dallas Morning News|url=http://www.dallasnews.com/sharedcontent/dws/dn/opinion/viewpoints/stories/DN-weiss_28edi.ART.State.Edition1.2758dd6.html|year=2007|accessdate=2007-08-18}}</ref> The quote on Dumbledore's family tomb, "Where your treasure is, there your heart will be also", is from Matthew 6:21, and refers to knowing which things in life are of true value.<ref>{{cite web|title="For Where Your Treasure Is, There Your Heart Will Be Also": Bible Quotes or Harry Potter Quotes?|author=Simran Khurana|work=about.com|year=2007|url=http://quotations.about.com/b/a/257731.htm|accessdate=2007-08-16}}</ref>  Abigail BeauSeigneur published an article on a popular Potter site, outlining the book's Christian allegories and symbols along with interviews from the author. A few Christians are skeptical, however, saying that BeauSeigneur is a "tool of the devil."<ref>SelectiveHouse Publishers. "Is Harry Potter the Son of God?" ''Christian Newswire''. Pub 2007-07-15.</ref> Raymond Keating also outlines several Christian themes of the last book in an article in ''[[Newsday]]'', concluding that "It's possible to read "Lord of the Rings" and "Narnia" without recognizing the religious aspects. That's even more so the case with "Harry Potter." But Christian themes are there nonetheless."<ref>Keating, Raymond J. "Harry Potter and the Christian allegory." ''Newsday'' (New York) Pub: 2007-08-13 Pg. A35</ref> Christian commentator Jerry Bowyer says of Rowling's "fundamentalist bashers",<ref name=bowyer>{{cite web|url=http://www.townhall.com/Columnists/JerryBowyer/2007/08/02/harry_potter_and_the_fire_breathing_fundamentalists?page=full&comments=true|title=Harry Potter and the Fire breathing Fundamentalists|author=Jerry Bowyer|year=2007|accessdate=2007-08-18}}</ref> "So much of the religious right failed to see the Christianity in the ''Potter'' novels because it knows so little Christianity itself . . . The gospel stories themselves, the various metaphors and figures of the Law and the Prophets, and their echoes down through the past two millennia of Christian literature and art are largely unknown to vast swaths of American Christendom."<ref name=bowyer /> As regards Rowling's belief that discussing her faith would spoil the books, Bowyer says, "For once, I disagree with her: I don't think [the bashers] would have guessed the ending. Most of them can't recognize the ending of the story even after it's been told."<ref name=bowyer />
