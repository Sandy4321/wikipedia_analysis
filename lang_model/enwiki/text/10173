==Background and development==
"Ave Maria" was written by Beyonc<U+00E9> Knowles, [[Amanda Ghost]], [[Ian Dench]], [[Makeba Riddick]], [[Stargate (production team)|Mikkel Storleer Eriksen and Tor Erik Hermansen]] while production was handled by Knowles and Stargate.<ref name="Booklet"/> The song was written in Bangladesh, Patchwerk and Silent Sound Studios, [[Atlanta]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] in 2008.<ref name="Booklet"/> Knowles worked with [[Amanda Ghost]] to re-write the [[Franz Schubert]] "[[Hail Mary|Ave Maria]]" after having co-written "Disappear" in London. She stated that the song was one of the most personal on the whole album.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.couriermail.com.au/entertainment/beyonce-leads-double-life/story-e6freq7f-1225702537836|title=Beyonce lets Sasha do the talking on stage|work=[[The Courier-Mail]]|publisher=[[Queensland Newspapers]]|first=Kathy|last=McCabe|date=April 25, 2009|accessdate=August 23, 2011}}</ref> On November 8, 2008, Ghost told ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' that both Knowles and herself were inspired by their recent marriages and had walked down the aisle to the song.<ref name="Ave Maria">{{Cite web|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/music/3563004/Beyonce-dream-girl.html |title=Beyonc<U+00E9>: dream girl |author=Tom Horan |date=November 8, 2008 |accessdate=February 28, 2011 |work=[[The Daily Telegraph|Daily Telegraph]]|publisher=Telegraph Media Group}}</ref> She further revealed, 
<blockquote>
She keeps the [[Jay-Z]] references ambiguous, but music is the one place she can be incredibly expressive - look at the lyrics to the track Ave Maria. We were talking about how much we loved the Schubert Ave Maria. We had both recently got married, and it turned out we had both come up the aisle to that song. So I said wouldn't it be great to try and rewrite it. And the lyric is very much about her. She talks about being surrounded by friends but she's alone: 'How can the silence seem so loud?' and then 'There's only us when the lights go down'. I think that's probably the most personal line on the whole album about her and Jay, because they are very real, and they're very much in love, and it must be pretty tough to have that love when you're incredibly famous.
