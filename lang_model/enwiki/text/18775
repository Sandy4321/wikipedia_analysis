==Allegations of foreign exchange violations in the IPL tournament held in South Africa in 2009==
In June 2013 the [[Enforcement Directorate]] (ED) sent him a notice for adjudication issued against him over allegations of [[Foreign Exchange Management Act|foreign exchange violations]] in the [[2009 Indian Premier League|IPL tournament]] held in South Africa in 2009, for which he approached the [[Bombay High Court]] challenging the notice. His counsel told the Bombay High Court that Lalit Modi who was chairman IPL and vice-president BCCI during IPL in 2009 took all major decisions after approval from the BCCI committee. Lalit Modi could have received his first 'reprimand' from Manohar way back in March 2010, but former India captain [[Sunil Gavaskar]], then a member of the Governing Council, requested that the 'reprimand' not be recorded.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.indianexpress.com/news/sunil-gavaskar-saved-lalit-modi-from-reprimand/1164223/ |title=Sunil Gavaskar saved Lalit Modi from 'reprimand' |accessdate=7 July 2013 | work=NDTV |date=18 September 2011}}</ref> Manohar had clearly advised the IPL governing council to first take permission from RBI and only then open an account in South Africa.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://sports.ndtv.com/cricket/news/209886-ipl-ex-bcci-chief-shashank-manohar-moves-high-court-against-ed-notice |title=IPL: Ex-BCCI chief Shashank Manohar moves High Court against ED notice |accessdate=7 July 2013 | work=NDTV |date=18 September 2011}}</ref> In response, the Bombay High Court quashed and set aside the notice issued by Enforcement Directorate (ED).<ref>{{cite news|url=http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/news-by-industry/et-cetera/high-court-sets-aside-ed-notice-to-former-bcci-president-shashank-manohar/articleshow/21676662.cms |title=High Court sets aside ED notice to former BCCI president Shashank Manohar |accessdate=7 August 2013 | work=NDTV |date=18 September 2011}}</ref>

==BCCI elections September 2013==
The mood within the BCCI was one of gloom and doom as members fumed and fretted over the murky state of affairs that has made Indian cricket an object of global ridicule. Even though a majority of members wanted Srinivasan out and had the numbers to do so, they were rendered powerless by a technicality. The Tamil Nadu strongman had all but made sure he will be elected unopposed as his rivals didn't have a proposer and seconder from South Zone for their candidate. Under BCCI rules, a contender for the top post must have the endorsement of at least two units from the zone whose turn it is to elect the president.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/fixing-hits-ipl/news/Board-wages-uphill-battle-to-deny-Srinivasan-extension/articleshow/22868953.cms|title=Board wages uphill battle to deny Srinivasan extension|accessdate=2 September 2013 | work=The Times of India}}</ref>

Manohar, who has always had a clean image as an administrator, tore apart Srinivasan in an interview to the tabloid ''[[Mumbai Mirror]]'' on 3 October 2013. He said that as [[N.Srinivasan]] was responsible for the mess in BCCI, he shouldn't be BCCI president any more. He further said "Srinivasan has no right to continue as president. If you had the slightest of conscience, self-esteem and care for the board, you ought to have put in your papers the moment your son-in-law ([[Gurunath Meiyappan]]) was arrested [for betting in IPL. You did nothing and, as a result, the board's reputation has taken a hit to the extent that the people have lost faith in this board." He concluded by saying: "I left the board two years back and I have not entered its premises again. I have no intention to come back. I said if all the members want me, I will not shirk the responsibility. This board has given me a lot and I was willing to give something back." <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ptinews.com/news/4035769_Ex-BCCI-prez-Manohar--amp--ruling-group-in-war-of-words-|title=Ex-BCCI prez Manohar & ruling group in war of words|accessdate=2 September 2013 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2013-10-04/news/42716136_1_n-srinivasan-former-bcci-gurunath-meiyappan|title=Srinivasan responsible for mess in BCCI: Shashank Manohar|accessdate=2 September 2013 | work=[[The Times of India]]}}</ref>

==April 2014 BCCI emergent Working committee meeting==
The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) called an emergent working committee meeting in Mumbai on Sunday, 20 April 2014, to decide its future course of action following the [[Supreme Court of India|Supreme Court]]'s order that forced N Srinivasan to step aside as the cricket board's president. The meeting was called after several state associations wrote to the BCCI interim president (administration) [[Shivlal Yadav]], demanding a discussion on the ongoing issues. Many state cricket association members think that only Shashank Manohar can restore cricket board's credibility. They wanted Manohar to lend his voice to their unhappiness at the meeting.

After attending the Working Committee meeting as a representative of [[Vidarbha Cricket Association]], Manohar said "I can't disclose what happened at the meeting. All I can say is I was disillusioned with the happenings. I had gone there with the purpose of cleaning up the image of the Board in public domain, but I was disillusioned."<ref name="sports.ndtv.com">{{cite web|url= http://sports.ndtv.com/indian-premier-league-2014/news/223326-supreme-court-rejects-bccis-proposed-panel-to-probe-ipl-scam|title= Supreme Court rejects BCCI's proposed panel to probe IPL scam, asks Mudgal committee if it can help |accessdate=2 September 2014 }}</ref>

Manohar was outvoted 14<U+2013>1 at the meeting for the appointment of three-member inquiry panel. The working committee appointed N.Srinivasan's cronies to investigate his own wrongdoings in the board.<ref name="sports.ndtv.com"/><ref name="sports.ndtv.com"/><ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.espncricinfo.com/india/content/story/738571.html|title= BCCI panel faces conflict issues|accessdate=2 September 2014 }}</ref>

Manohar had said [in the April 2014 Working committee meeting] that Justice Mudgal who is completely unbiased & can effectively probe the scam with the help of [[Central Bureau of Investigation|CBI]] instead of the 3 members elected by Srinivasan's cronies.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/india/content/story/738809.html|title= 'A blow to BCCI, could hurt autonomous status' |accessdate=2 September 2014 }}</ref>

On 22 April 2014 the [[Supreme Court of India]] endorsed Shashank Manohar's view & rejected BCCI's proposed panel to probe IPL scam, asked Mudgal committee if it can help probe the scam with the help of [[Central Bureau of Investigation|CBI]].<ref name="sports.ndtv.com"/>

==Justice Mudgal Committee report in the IPL corruption scandal==
In April 2014 the Supreme Court of India appointed probe commission headed by (Retd) Justice Mukul Mudgal  to investigate the betting and match fixing scandal in the IPL. The committee also included Additional Solicitor General L Nageswara Rao, advocate Nilay Datta, Deputy DG (Narcotics Control Bureau) BB Mishra and the police departments in Delhi, Mumbai and Chennai to assist the investigation.

===N.Srinivasan named in the Mudgal Committee Report===
In November 2014 in response to the final submission of the Mudgal Committee Report, a special bench of the [[Supreme Court of India]] comprising justice TS Thakur and FM Kalifullah has named & issued notices to four key individuals including [[N Srinivasan]] and [[Gurunath Meiyappan]] in connection with the Mudgal report into the 2013 IPL spot-fixing case, which, the court observed, had suggested several "misdemeanours" by the duo.

In view of the court's observation, Manohar urged the BCCI member associations to take a stance. "The image of the Board is tarnished by the actions and the attitude of Mr Srinivasan. The gentlemen's game, as the game of cricket has long been known, and the reputation of the Board is at its lowest due to the egoistic and autocratic behaviour of one individual. The Board and the game of Cricket is bigger than any individual and it is the responsibility and duty of every individual connected with the game to preserve the dignity and integrity of the Game and the Board, and through this press note, I appeal to all members of the Board to rise to the occasion and prevent the Board and the Game from being further destroyed."

Manohar said on Friday that the BCCI was flouting its own constitution by repeatedly putting off its Annual General Meeting that should have been held before September 30. "It appears that during today's hearing, as soon as the names of Srinivasan and Meiyappan were disclosed, the counsel for the BCCI made a request for the postponement of the AGM and elections scheduled on November 20," Manohar said.
"It is thus evident that the instructions given to the Board counsel are only with an intent to suit Srinivasan as that would ensure that he still remains a back-seat driver," said Manohar. The AGM has been postponed by four weeks, the second time it has been deferred, a first in BCCI's history!

The former BCCI president argued that since the Supreme Court has named Srinivasan and his son-in-law Gurunath Meiyappan, it means there are allegations of corruption against them in the report. Yet Srinivasan remote controls the BCCI, complained Manohar.

It has been widely said that Manohar may once again reform a new axis that could challenge Srinivasan's juggernaut in BCCI in the upcoming AGM. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/india/content/story/799467.html|title= Srinivasan named in Mudgal report |accessdate=2 September 2014 }}</ref> <ref>{{cite web|url=http://ibnlive.in.com/news/cricketnext/bccis-reputation-at-its-lowest-due-to-autocratic-srinivasan-shashank-manohar/512735-78.html|title= BCCI's reputation at its lowest due to autocratic Srinivasan: Shashank Manohar |accessdate=2 September 2014 }}</ref> <ref>{{cite web|url=http://sports.ndtv.com/cricket/news/233042-n-srinivasan-is-autocratic-remains-bcci-s-back-seat-driver-shashank-manohar|title= N.
