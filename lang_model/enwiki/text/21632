'''Frank Cohen''' (born 15 October 1943) is the founder of Glyn Webb Home Improvement Stores, which is a large chain of [[Do It Yourself]] (DIY) stores in North East, North West, Yorkshire, East Anglia and the Midlands of England.  He is also one of the most famous art collectors in the world. 

==Life and career==

Frank Cohen began collecting Modern British art in the 1970s.  In the late 1980s he became a patron and supporter of the [[Young British Artists]] (YBAs), American and German art of the 1980s and 1990s, contemporary Japanese art (especially the [[Superflat]] movement) and more recently contemporary Chinese and Indian art.  He is every year listed in ARTnews magazine<U+2019>s list of <U+2018>The World<U+2019>s Top 200 Collectors<U+2019> [http://www.artnewsonline.com/issues/article.asp?art_id=2088] and is often referred to as the [[Charles Saatchi]] of the North or the [[Medici]] of the North.  "A short, blustery man with cheerful demeanor and a great sense of humor, he can be found snatching up work at prominent art fairs with the likes of [[Nicolai Frahm]] [http://www.artobserved.com/collectors/frank-cohen]."  Cohen opened in January 2007 a foundation in Wolverhampton to show younger artists from his collection called Initial Access [http://www.initialaccess.co.uk].  Today Cohen has become known as one of the most influential promoters of international contemporary art in the world.
