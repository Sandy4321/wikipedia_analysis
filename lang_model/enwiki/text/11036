'''[[Wolverine (comics)|Wolverine]]''' is one of the only [[X-Men]] character to be included in every media adaptation of the ''X-Men'' franchise, including [[film]], television, [[Video game|computer and video games]], and is the only one to have starred in his own video games.

==Television==
===''Spider-Man and His Amazing Friends''===
Wolverine appears alongside the other X-Men in the episode "A Firestar Is Born" of the animated series, ''[[Spider-Man and His Amazing Friends]]'' played by voice-actor [[Neil Ross]].

===''Pryde of the X-Men''===
He also appears in the [[1989 in television|1989]] [[animated series|animated]] [[television pilot]] ''[[X-Men: Pryde of the X-Men]]''. [[Neil Ross]] reprises the character in both episodes, using an apparent [[Australian accent]]. This was due to the actor and director misunderstanding a line in the script. In the original script Wolverine calls the Australian mutant [[Pyro (comics)|Pyro]] "dingo", and rather than take that as an odd Australian slur, they assumed Wolverine to be Australian.

===Marvel animated universe===
[[Cathal J. Dodd]] voice-acts as Wolverine in the 1990s ''[[X-Men (animated series)|X-Men]]'' [[animated television series]], the ''[[Marvel vs. Capcom (series)|Marvel vs. Capcom]]'' series of [[fighting game]]s, two episodes of the ''[[Spider-Man (1994 TV series)|Spider-Man]]'' animated series, and the ''[[X-Men Cartoon Maker]]'' PC game. [[Masashi Ebara]] voiced the character in the Japanese dub. He used the aliases "Logan" and "John Logan" in the series.

===''X-Men: Evolution''===
In the 2000<U+2013>2003 animated television series ''[[X-Men: Evolution]]'', Wolverine, a man whose past is shrouded in mystery, provides the teenaged X-Men with battle training and creates conflict among his younger teammates. Voice-actor [[Scott McNeil]] portrays him.

This version of Wolverine doesn't have a romantic interest in Jean Grey, largely due to the age gap between the two. While this is normally not a problem for the hundred-year-old plus Wolverine in the comics, Jean was technically a legal minor for at least part of the first season of the show (she was around 17 at that time on the show), and the writers likely did not want to portray such a relationship to avoid censorship issues, a problem which does not exist in the comics as both are over the age of majority and of consent. Wolverine is an acting teacher at Xavier's institute, specifically in combat and survival techniques, but his gruff nature and soldier-minded concepts of training garner very little enthusiasm for his sessions from the younger students. His training as a [[ninja]] is hinted at in "Rogue Recruit", when he dons a nightsuit during a demonstration session for [[Kitty Pryde]].

Wolverine, along with Storm and Beast, is an old friend of Xavier and takes a surrogate father role to the students much as Xavier does, specifically with Kitty Pryde, Rogue, and Nightcrawler. He shows a very protective side of himself when confronted with the story of the background of [[X-23]], his clone who is introduced to the world in the third season. He also has ties to Magneto in this series, having saved Magneto as a child from the concentration camps in World War II, although the two of them are enemies throughout the entirety of the series, Magneto refuses to take an opportunity to kill Wolverine, Rogue, and Nightcrawler in the episode "Operation Rebirth" due to a debt he feels he owes to Wolverine for said rescue.

For most of the series Wolverine wears an orange and black costume reminiscent of his second, tan X-Men suit. Late in the series, he adopts a more realistic costume close in design to his Ultimate uniform.

===''Wolverine and the X-Men''===
''[[Wolverine and the X-Men (TV series)|Wolverine and the X-Men]]'' is the newest cartoon for the X-Men franchise, with [[Steven Blum]] playing the lead role. After an attack on the school and the disappearance of Xavier and Jean Grey, the X-Men disassemble. However, Wolverine begins taking a slightly uncharacteristic role in rebuilding the team, and with Beast investigating the attack on the school. After recruiting Iceman, Shadowcat, Forge, Beast, Cyclops, Storm and reluctantly agreeing to take on Emma Frost as their resident telepath, Logan leads the team in search for Xavier. After finding their mentor who is left in a coma-like state, they receive a message from Xavier in the future, informing the team that Logan continues to take leadership of the team, over Cyclops (who now suffers from depression over the loss of Jean, and cannot lead). This is the first series to mention Wolverine's birth name of "James", which he was called by Mystique.

===''The Super Hero Squad Show''===
For the seventh time, Steve Blum voices Wolverine again for the ''[[The Super Hero Squad Show]]'' series on Cartoon Network as a member of the squad. This version of him is more kid friendly, although still tough and violent. He used to attend Xavier's School for Higher Learning, known as Mutant High in this universe, but never obtained his diploma due to the Shi'ar invasion.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.comicscontinuum.com/stories/0907/28/voices.htm |title=Comics Continuum |publisher=Comics Continuum |date=2009-07-28 |accessdate=2010-09-13}}</ref> Captain Canada appears in episode 11, "O, Captain, My Captain!". Tired of all he can take with the Super Hero Squad, Wolverine joins up with the international All-Captains Squad (consisting of Captain America, Captain Australia, Captain Brazil, Captain Britain, and Captain Liechtenstein) as '''Captain Canada''' where he helps them fight Plantman in the Amazon.

=== ''Black Panther'' ===
Wolverine appears in ''[[Black Panther (TV series)|Black Panther]]'' voiced by [[Kevin Michael Richardson]].

===''The Avengers: Earth's Mightiest Heroes''===
Wolverine appears during a flashback scene of episode 14 of the prequel micro-series to the animated series, ''[[The Avengers: Earth's Mightiest Heroes]]''. Logan fights alongside [[Captain America]] and other heroes as a [[Howling Commandos]] soldier in [[World War II]]. He is referred to as Howlett, which corresponds with his birth name of James Howlett. He is again voiced by [[Steven Blum]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://twitter.com/yost/status/26725666220 |title=Twitter / Christopher Yost: @I_am_onlive that's right |publisher=Twitter.com |date=2010-10-08 |accessdate=2010-10-10}}</ref>

Wolverine makes an initial cameo appearance in Season Two of the show - along with [[Beast (comics)|Beast]] and [[Cyclops (comics)|Cyclops]] - in ''The Avengers'' episode "Infiltration" on one of the photos of known superbeings pondered over by [[Nick Fury]], who is trying to determine which heroes he can now turn to in the [[Secret Invasion|upcoming Skrull invasion]].

Wolverine also appears in the "New Avengers" episode. He appears in his astonishing costume and is never unmasked. In the episode, he joins forces with Spider-Man, Luke Cage, Iron Fist, War Machine and the Thing to fight Kang.

===''Marvel Anime: Wolverine''===
As part of a [[Marvel Anime|four-series collaboration]] between the [[Japan]]ese [[Madhouse (company)|Madhouse]] animation house and Marvel, Wolverine starred in a twelve-episode [[anime]] series that premiered in Japan on [[Animax]] and in the United States on [[G4 (TV channel)|G4]] in 2011.<ref>{{Cite news | url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2010-07-23/marvel-anime-to-run-on-g4-in-the-united-states | title=Marvel Anime to Run on G4 in the United States | work=[[Anime News Network]] | date=July 23, 2010 | accessdate=July 24, 2010}}</ref> The series will focus on him going to Japan to investigate [[Advanced Idea Mechanics|A.I.M.]] Logan also appears during episode 4 of the ''[[Marvel Anime#Iron Man|Iron Man]]'' portion of the collaboration. He is voiced by [[Rikiya Koyama]] in the Japanese version and [[Milo Ventimiglia]] in the English dubbed version.

=== ''Spider-Woman'' motion comics ===
Wolverine appears in the ''[[Spider-Woman]]'' [[motion comic]]s. In this series, he is voiced by Jeffrey Hedquist.

===''Marvel Anime: X-Men''===
Wolverine makes his next Marvel Anime appearance here, along with his fellow X-Men.  [[Steven Blum]] reprises the role of Wolverine in the English version, along with familiar voice actors from Wolverine and the X-Men.

===''Ultimate Spider-Man''===
The Ultimate version of Wolverine appeared in ''[[Ultimate Spider-Man (TV series)|Ultimate Spider-Man]]'', voiced by [[Steven Blum]]. He sports his classic brown and yellow costume, rather than his Ultimate Costume.

==Films==
Many actors were considered for playing the part of Wolverine in a film adaptation of [[X-Men]]. At one point in the 1990s, [[Glenn Danzig]] was approached to play Wolverine in [[ad hoc]] committee ''X-Men'' film, because he bore a very slight resemblance to the character, as well as being the same height as Wolverine, and very muscular. However, he had to decline, because the shooting for the film would have forced him to put a halt to touring with [[Danzig (band)|his band]] for nine months.<ref>MTV News. June 3, 1997</ref>

[[Bryan Singer]], the director of the first two ''X-Men'' movies, spoke to a number of actors about the role. He says [[Russell Crowe]] was too exhausted after playing a similar role in ''Gladiator''; that the role didn't appeal to [[Edward Norton]] (Norton was also considered for fellow Marvel villain the [[Green Goblin]] in ''[[Spider-Man (film)|Spider-Man]]'' which he didn't play and would later be cast as fellow Marvel hero [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]] for the 2008 film ''[[The Incredible Hulk (film)|The Incredible Hulk]]''); Fox themselves ruled out [[Mel Gibson]] as being too expensive. In 1999, ''SFX magazine'' spoke to [[Keanu Reeves]], who told the publication he didn't feel he was right for the role.

Eventually, [[Dougray Scott]] was cast as Wolverine, but shooting on ''[[Mission: Impossible II]]'' overran. [[Hugh Jackman]] became his replacement, and went on to play Wolverine in all the ''X-Men'' films: ''[[X-Men (film)|''X-Men'']]'', ''[[X2 (film)|''X2: X-Men United'']]'', and ''[[X-Men: The Last Stand]]''. When it was first announced, it was considered a highly controversial move,{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}} as Hugh Jackman was not only known solely for his musical theater career, but the fact that he was simply too tall for the role (Jackman being 6'3", the comic-book version of Wolverine being approximately 5'3"). Despite these divergences though, Jackman's actual performance was incredibly well-received, becoming one of highlights of the series and launching his career into super-stardom.<ref>{{cite web| title = Daily Poll: Superhero casting| publisher = IMDb| url = http://www.imdb.com/poll/results/2006-07-12| accessdate = 2006-10-21}}</ref> He played this role again for a prequel film revealing more on Wolverine's origins titled ''[[X-Men Origins: Wolverine]]''. He also play this role in ''[[X-Men: First Class]]''.

===''X-Men'' (2000)===
At the beginning of ''[[X-Men (film)|X-Men]]'', Logan / Wolverine ([[Hugh Jackman]]) is introduced as a [[Canadian]] cage fighter, taking advantage of his [[adamantium]] skeleton. He is confronted by a young runaway named Marie, who later becomes [[Rogue (comics)|Rogue]] ([[Anna Paquin]]). It is here that she sees Wolverine's retractable adamantium-laced claws, when the latter engages in a fight. When he is about to leave in his truck, Rogue introduces herself to him and asks if she can come along. At first, he refuses, but later he relents and takes her with him.

On their way, their truck is attacked by [[Sabretooth (comics)|Sabretooth]] ([[Tyler Mane]]). Wolverine tries to battle with him, but is knocked out. Before Sabretooth can do any further damage, he is stopped and chased away by two other mysterious mutants, [[Cyclops (comics)|Cyclops]] ([[James Marsden]]) and [[Storm (Marvel Comics)|Storm]] ([[Halle Berry]]), who rescue both Wolverine and Rogue and bring them to the X-Mansion.

When Dr. [[Jean Grey]] ([[Famke Jannsen]]) tries to treat Wolverine, he comes to his senses and immediately starts exploring the place. He finds out that there are mutants like him there who were trying to control their unnatural abilities under the tutelage of Professor [[Charles Xavier]] ([[Patrick Stewart]]). Professor X convinces Wolverine to stay with them and become an [[X-Men|X-Man]], as he could get an opportunity to learn more about his forgotten past. Wolverine agrees and stays. A rivalry immediately forms between Cyclops and Wolverine as the latter romantically flirts relentlessly with Jean, the girlfriend of Cyclops.

Later, [[Mystique (comics)|Mystique]] ([[Rebecca Romijn]]), impersonating [[Bobby Drake|Bobby Drake / Iceman]] ([[Shawn Ashmore]]), tells Rogue to leave the place as "she is a danger to everybody else". This was actually a trick to lure Rogue out of the X-Mansion, so that she could be used by [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]] ([[Ian McKellen]]) in the success of a machine that could turn all humans into mutants. When Wolverine finds out about Rogue's absence, he along with the X-Men reach the [[Statue of Liberty]] where Magneto is operating on his plans. In the process, Wolverine encounters Mystique and stabs her, virtually killing her, but she survives. He is also challenged by Sabretooth and they both engage in a fight, but Cyclops knocks Sabretooth off the Statue and he crashes into a boat below. In the end, Wolverine frees Rogue from the machine after Cyclops takes out Magneto, but she appears to be dead. Wolverine suffers life-threatening injuries when he intentionally makes contact with Rogue, allowing her to absorb his mutant regeenrative healing factor in order to recover. After awakening in the mansion and recovering from his vast injuries, he declares his sincere amorous feelings for a reticent Jean. As a reward of his victory along with the X-Men, Professor X gives Wolverine a hint for the search of his past, directing him to a mysterious Alkali Lake. Prior to his departure, Wolverine leaves his dog-tag necklace with Rogue, promising that "I'll be back for this". At the end of the film, Wolverine is seen leaving the mansion on Scott's (Cyclops) bike towards his destination.

===''X2: X-Men United'' (2003)===
In ''[[X2 (film)|X2: X-Men United]]'', continuing his search that he started at the end of ''X-Men'', Wolverine finally discovers the Alkali Lake, but only finds an old and deserted factory, giving no clue about his forgotten past. He is disappointed and returns to the X-Mansion after a call from Professor X.

Upon returning, Wolverine is given the responsibility to look after the mutant children in the mansion in Professor X's absence, who plans to visit Magneto in his "plastic prison" with Cyclops to discover what information had he given to [[William Stryker]] ([[Brian Cox (actor)|Brian Cox]]). Jean Grey and Storm also leave in search of [[Nightcrawler (comics)|Nightcrawler]] ([[Alan Cummings]]), who was found guilty of attacking the [[President]] of the [[USA|United States]]. When the Professor is interrogating Magneto, he learns that Magneto had been drugged to leak all the information about the X-Mansion and the Cerebro to Stryker. Moreover, Professor X is later kidnapped along with Cyclops by Stryker's forces.

Back in the X-Mansion, at night, Wolverine has nightmares of his involvement in the mysterious [[Weapon X]] program, and decides to walk around the mansion, where he starts chatting with Bobby / Iceman. But all of a sudden, Stryker along with his military troops, invades the mansion and starts to the look for the Cerebro. Wolverine kills many of the soldiers, and saves the mutant children. He asks [[Colossus (comics)|Colossus / Piotr Rasputin]] ([[Daniel Cudmore]]), Bobby, Rogue and [[Pyro (comics)|Pyro / John Allerdyce]] ([[Aaron Stanford]]) to leave. And as Wolverine is about to escape too, he is confronted by William Stryker, whose presence strikes more forgotten memories in his mind. But he shakes out of it, and leaves with the remaining X-Men in a car for [[Boston]] to Bobby's house. Meanwhile, Stryker finds the Cerebro and steals it.

When Storm and Jean, along with Nightcrawler, learn of the attack on the X-Mansion from Wolverine, they head towards Boston in the [[X-Jet]] to recruit the X-Men from Bobby's house. During the X-Men's journey, Magneto and Mystique, who helped the former to escape from his prison, offer their help to the X-Men in bringing down William Stryker, who, as revealed by Magneto, was planning to use Professor X and his handling of the Cerebro to kill all the mutants on Earth. He also reveals Stryker's base of operations to be the Alkali Lake. The X-Men agree to form the alliance. Wolverine later kisses Jean, but is rejected by her as she tells him that she loves Scott. Mystique, seeing this exchange, takes advantage of Wolverine's love for Jean and approaches him in his tent, disguised as Jean, but Wolverine quickly discerns that she is an imposter(by the wound on her stomach made by Wolverine's claws in the first film) and rejects her.

At the Alkali Lake, Jean finds that Stryker's base was underground. Mystique, impersonating Wolverine, infiltrates the base and tricks Stryker's troops to open a gateway for the X-Men to enter. There, Wolverine decides to explore the base all by himself and he comes across a laboratory where he sees his claws' scratch marks on the walls. Now, he starts remembering what happened to him and how he was experimented upon with the adamantium. William Stryker arrives and clears Wolverine's doubts, revealing that he had created the "animal within Wolverine". When Wolverine is about to get his hands on him, Stryker introduces another mutant with adamantium skeleton and claws, [[Lady Deathstrike|Lady Deathstrike / Yuriko Oyama]] ([[Kelly Hu]]), who gets the better of Wolverine in a fight until he injects an overdose of liquid adamantium into her body. Wolverine trails Styker while the other X-Men rescue Cyclops, Professor X and the kidnapped mutant children.

After the destruction of his base, Stryker tries to flee in his helicopter but is caught by Wolverine and interrogated. Stryker refuses to cooperate and is pinned by Wolverine, who leaves him to be drowned in the flood water. When the X-Men are about to leave, Jean sacrifices herself by protecting them from the flood. Wolverine and Cyclops mourn her death. In the end of the film, Wolverine, hiding his love for Jean, informs Cyclops that Jean had chosen to be with Scott.

===''X-Men: The Last Stand'' (2006)===
Wolverine returns in ''[[X-Men: The Last Stand]]''. He once again stands against Magneto and his Brotherhood, apparently now more comfortable in his role as an X-Man and a hero, but he is conflicted with the decision of whether or not to kill Jean Grey, who is being influenced by her dual personality, the Phoenix.

He goes to Magneto's hideout to get Jean. He is confronted by [[Spyke|Spike]] whom he kills with his claws. After listening to Magneto's speech to hundreds of his mutant army and their plans to kill [[Leech (comics)|Jimmy]], the mutant that the "mutant cure" originated from, he decides to convince Jean to return with the X-Men. After a brief confrontation with Magneto, Wolverine tells [[Beast (comics)|Beast]], [[Storm (Marvel Comics)|Storm]] and others about Magneto's plans and they decide to stop him.

In the climax, on the [[Alcatraz Island]] With the help of [[Colossus (comics)|Colossus]] and a [[Fastball Special]], he distracts Magneto, allowing Beast to inject him with the cure, curing him. Finally, when Jean,(possessed by the almighty Phoenix Force) goes on a violently destructive rampage, he goes towards her, relying on his rapid, regenerative healing abilities to save himself from being dismembered by Jean's vastly strengthened and magnified psisonic powers which were now working at sub-atomic power level. Finally, he decides to go against his decisions and stabs Jean with his claws after confessing his deep, strong romantic love for her.

===''Hulk Vs'' (2009)===
Steven Blum reprised his role as Wolverine in the film ''[[Hulk Vs]]'', in a segment called "Hulk Vs. Wolverine". It also features many insights on Wolverine's past. This was tied in with the ''[[Wolverine and the X-Men (TV series)|Wolverine and the X-Men]]'' series in episode 7, titled "Wolverine vs. Hulk", though the ties are incredibly loose, as there is very little (if any) continuity between this movie and the episode.

===''X-Men Origins: Wolverine'' (2009)===
[[Image:Wolverine Origins film.jpg|thumb|right|300px|[[Hugh Jackman]] played as Wolverine in the 2009 film ''X-Men Origins: Wolverine''.]]
[[20th Century Fox]] set [[Gavin Hood]] to direct Hugh Jackman in ''[[X-Men Origins: Wolverine]]'', an "X-Men" spinoff that was written by [[David Benioff]] and [[Skip Woods]]. ''X-Men Origins: Wolverine'', which began production in November 2007 for a May 1, 2009 release, was produced by Lauren Shuler-Donner, Ralph Winter, Jackman and his Seed Productions partner John Palermo. Using several resources that include the Marvel Comics lore, along with the more recent Weapon X graphic novels, Wolverine mixes action with an origin story about how Logan emerged from a barbaric experiment as an indestructible mutant with retractable razor-sharp claws.<ref>{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.superherohype.com/news/topnews.php?id=6033 |title=Gavin Hood to Direct Wolverine! |publisher=Superhero Hype! |date=2007-07-19 |accessdate=2010-09-13}}</ref>

This story begins with Wolverine's childhood as James Howlett, his powers activating in 1845 after witnessing the death of his father at the hands of Thomas Logan, who reveals that he is James' biological father only after the grief-stricken James has impaled him with his new claws. Fleeing with his half-brother [[Sabretooth (comics)|Victor]], the two spend the next several decades operating as soldiers in various wars (where their mutant abilities offered an edge in battle, allowing the brothers to survive from time to time) until Vietnam when they are recruited by now-Major William Stryker for a special team (consisting of Logan, [[William Stryker|Stryker]], [[Sabretooth (comics)|Victor]], teleporter [[Kestrel (Marvel Comics)|John Wraith]], super-strong [[Blob (comics)|Fred Dukes]], marksman [[David North (comics)|David North]] (a.k.a. Agent Zero), electricity manipulator [[Chris Bradley]] and swordsman/martial artist [[Deadpool|Wade Wilson]]) after Victor kills their commanding officer, but James leaves the team after realizing how willing the other members are to kill innocent people to achieve their goals.

Moving on to become a lumberjack with a woman called [[Silver Fox|Kayla Silverfox]], James - now going by the name of his real father, Logan - is lured back to Stryker after the apparently rogue Victor kills Kayla, prompting him to agree to Stryker's offer to enhance his skeleton with adamantium to give him the strength to kill Victor- choosing the name 'Wolverine' from a tale Kayla told him about a spirit that was tricked into being parted forever from his lover the Moon-, only to flee when he learns that Stryker intends to erase his memories and use his DNA as part of another experiment. Escaping the labs and eliminating the first wave of pursuers- along with his former teammate [[David North (comics)|Agent Zero]]- Wolverine tracks down teammates [[John Wraith]] and [[Blob (comics)|Fred Dukes]], learning from both of an island facility where Stryker keeps mutants prisoner. Finding the facility with the aid of [[Gambit (comics)|Gambit]]- the only mutant alive to escape it-, Wolverine is horrified to learn that Kayla was actually an agent of Stryker's all along and her death was faked, but is spurred back into action when he learns that she did genuinely love him. Freeing the mutant prisoners- including Kayla's sister [[Emma Frost|Emma]] and Wolverine's future ally [[Cyclops (comics)|Scott Summers]]-, Wolverine confronts the newly activated 'Weapon XI'- his former teammate and friend Wade Wilson now Deadpool, his mouth now sealed shut and artificially granted multiple mutant powers-, finally defeating him with the aid of Victor, who vows that only he gets to kill Wolverine.

Before Wolverine can leave with Kayla, however, Stryker shoots Wolverine in the head with adamantium bullets, subsequently departing after Kayla orders him to leave using her power of persuasion. When Wolverine regains consciousness, his injuries have healed but the damage to his brain has seemingly permanently destroyed his memories, subsequently departing the island to seek his own way.

===''X-Men: First Class'' (2011)===
Jackman reprises his role as Wolverine in a cameo in ''[[X-Men: First Class]]'', another origin film set in the 1960s about the beginnings of the X-Men. Charles Xavier and Erik Lehnsherr find Wolverine via Cerebro and introduce themselves to him at a bar, but he rudely dismisses them, although he looks back at them thoughtfully as they leave the bar.

===''The Wolverine'' (2013)===
Hugh Jackman is set to reprise his role as Wolverine in a [[X-Men Origins: Wolverine#Sequel|sequel]] to ''X-Men Origins: Wolverine'' entitled ''[[The Wolverine (film)|The Wolverine]]''. The film will chronicle Wolverine's time in Japan, as well as his strong and close romantic relationship with his lover Mariko, and confrontation with [[Silver Samurai]].

* Wolverine appears in ''[[Spider-Man: Web of Shadows]]'' voiced by [[Steven Blum]]. He ambushes Spider-Man at Hell's Kitchen and ask him questions to determine if Spider-Man is a [[symbiote]] or not. Later in the game, Wolverine becomes a symbiote-possessed monster and battles Spider-Man, serving a more powerful version of the boss form he was in earlier. If the player chooses the Red Suit Path, Wolverine uses his claws to gut himself, effectively removing the symbiote. (Ironically, Wolverine had originally suggested doing this to Spiderman if the symbiote managed to gain control of him.) If the player chooses the Black Suit Path, Spider-Man will absorb Wolverine's symbiote and then rip him in half with Wolverine swearing to kill him. In both Black Suit endings, Black Widow enlists a symbiote-controlled Wolverine (who is in full control of his symbiote) to bring her Spider-Man dead or alive. The Symbiote-Wolverine prefers the dead option. Wolverine is an assist character who will slash at any opponents in all versions.

==Music==
The [[Bloodhound Gang]] mention Wolverine in the song "[[Why's Everybody Always Pickin' On Me?]]". In the first few lines, the song states that when the person was born, "Wolverine is less hairy than your son", referencing Wolverine's prodigious body hair.

The band [[Entombed (band)|Entombed]] has an album, ''[[Wolverine Blues]]'', with Wolverine on an alternate cover. The album also had a single of the same name. The band, though, did not intend to associate the album or the song with the character - even though the music video of the title track contains many images of Wolverine.

Brazilian rock singer Nasi, of [[Ira!]] fame, because of his similarity with the character, in his first solo album, called "Onde os Anjos N<U+00E3>o Ousam Pisar" (''where angels dare not to tread''), posed as Wolverine, with a cigar and adamantium claws. The album has also a track called "Wolverine Blues", but it has no connection with the [[Entombed (band)|Entombed]] version.

The punk band [[Rancid (band)|Rancid]] has a song called "Sidekick" which mentions Wolverine fighting police officers and government agents to protect homeless people.

The rap artist [[Xzibit]] references Wolverine in his song "[[X (Xzibit song)|X]]", with the (admittedly incorrect) line "My whole skeleton is dipped in titanium" (the correct would be adamantium).

Canadian heavy metal band [[Annihilator (band)]] have song called ''Weapon X'' which is based on [[Wolverine (comics)]].

==Action figures==
{{Original research|date=August 2010}}
Wolverine has often been rendered in plastic, either independently, or in conjunction with other media. [[Mattel]] was the first, with the 1984 [[Secret Wars]] line, supported by five points of articulation, including the neck, shoulders and hips. Among other notable figures, started a controversial trend in toys: the variant. His claws came in two different color options, one set silver, the other set black. When collectors began trying to complete their sets for Secret Wars, the silver set was readily available, while the black set was found to be rare.

While Wolverine was the first to be rendered in plastic, the other X-Men would go several years with no interest, until 1992 when "[[Night of the Sentinels]]" was shown in animated form. With a toy line in stores retailing at roughly five inches, they had a modest roster of seven figures. The sculpts were a cross between DC's Superpowers line and GI Joe. The points of articulation included on these figures were relatively standard, but many of the figures also include action features as well.

Out of the twenty-eight waves of the X-Men line produced by [[Marvel Toys|Toy Biz]], starting with 1991s series 1, only two series of the line did not feature a Wolverine (Counting Albert, because his package clearly states; "Robot Wolverine"...) Twenty-six figures were eventually produced, but with; repaints, two-ups (10" figures) or reissues, the total count is uncertain.

In 1998, Marvel had begun producing ''[[X-Men: Evolution#Merchandise|X-Men: Evolution]]'' in '99, and that line of toys yielded a net of six Wolverine action figures. But at the same time of the movies release, Wolverine gave us another nine figures. The toy line performed well, as Toy Biz began producing figures in 6" to support the character's animated exploits. In 2003, they featured a figures with twenty-six POA. X-Men: Classics were 6" and they added three Wolverines...

[[Marvel Legends]] started in 2002, releasing two solid waves with no Wolverine. [[Toy Biz]] boasted 26+ POA (points of articulation), extreme detail, and excellent paint applications. It seemed that Marvel wanted to create iconic versions of all their characters with the collector in mind. Gone were the days of colorful, childlike toy packages. They were replaced with; impenetrable clamshells that flattered the characters in general.

During [[Marvel Toys|Toy Biz]]'s production of [[Marvel Legends]], there were a total of 13 Wolverine figures produced. These included Classic costume (with unmasked variant), Brown costume, a Weapon X figure, a "Days of Future Past" Logan figure (with younger variant), an "Astonishing X-Men" costume (with unmasked variant), an "Age of Apocalypse" figure (with burnt face variant), another unmasked Classic costume model (With a different head sculpt included in an X-Men 5-pack boxset) and an original costume model included in a 2-pack with Sabretooth (a variant "raging" model was also produced). [[Marvel Toys|Toy Biz]] as well produced a short-lived X-Men Classics toy line which included two more Wolverine figures. Another X-Men line was released in 2005 which included ''Ninja Armor Wolverine'', ''Stealth Wolverine'' and ''Air Strike Wolverine'' action figures.

In 2007, [[Hasbro]] took over production of [[Marvel Legends]]. The 2nd wave of figures produced included an "Ultimate" Wolverine figure. Also they produced a 25th Anniversity Wolverine exclusively to Toys R Us. The figure itself is just a repaint of Toy Biz's Marvel Legends Series 6 Wolverine painted silver. The package comes with no BAF and features a picture of his famous solo series.

Diamond Select began a [[Marvel Select]] collectors line-up. They promised even more detail than the X-Men and Marvel Legends lines. Although they were not in scale with the other figures, offered more Wolverines, three to date. Marvel Legends has provided 13 different figures, including variants, including deluxe scale figures and [[Icons]].

Wolverine is the second figurine in the Classic Marvel Figurine Collection. It is notably the shortest figurine in the collection at 77.5 millimeters.
