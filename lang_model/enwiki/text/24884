Duke '''Otto Henry of Brunswick-L<U+00FC>neburg-Harburg''' (born: 16 June 1555 in [[Hamburg-Harburg|Harburg]]; died: 15 October 1591 in [[Brussels]]), was a member of [[House of Guelph]] and the heir apparent of [[Brunswick-L<U+00FC>neburg]]-Harburg.

== Life ==
Otto Henry was the eldest son of the Duke [[Otto II, Duke of Brunswick-Harburg|Otto II of Brunswick-Harburg]] (1528<U+2013>1603) from his first marriage with Margaret (1530<U+2013>1559), the daughter of the Count John Henry of Schwarzburg-Leutenberg.

Otto Henry was educated under his father's strict supervision.  He was taught science, but otto II had strictly forbidden the instruction of fine arts.  Otto Henry studied at the University of Strasbourg, and was a canon at [[Bremen]] for a while, butthen chose a military career.  In 1590, he led the cavalry of the Duke [[Alessandro Farnese, Duke of Parma|Alessandro Farnese]] in the [[Eighty Years' War]] and showed great courage in the battle of [[Ivry-la-Bataille|Ivry]] on 14 March 1590.  He was seriously wounded in this battle.

Otto Henry died a year later, in Brussels in 1591 at the age of 36.  Since he died before his father, he never inherited Harburg.

== Marriage and issue ==
Otto Henry married in 1588 with Marie d'Henin-Lietard (d. 1606), the daughter of Count Jean de Bossu, with whom he had a son.  However, since this was a [[morganatic marriage]], his son was not able to inherit Harburg.
