'''Machinations''' are an Australian [[synth pop]] band which formed in 1980. They reached the top&nbsp;20 on the [[Kent Music Report]] Albums Chart with ''Big Music'' (24 June 1985). Their top&nbsp;30 hits on the related Kent Music Report Singles Chart are "Pressure Sway" (June 1983), "No Say in It" (September 1984), "My Heart's on Fire" (May 1985), and "Do to You" (August 1987). Earlier they had achieved indie prominence with two versions of their first single, "Average Inadequacy" (September 1981, March 1982). Machinations developed a cult following in dance clubs during the mid-1980s. By late 1989 the group had disbanded, they briefly reunited in 1997 and then reformed in 2012.

== History ==

Machinations formed in 1980 in Sydney with the line up of Tim Doyle on guitar; Fred Loneragan on lead vocals; and Tony Starr on keyboards, vocals, and drum machine.<ref name="McF"/><ref name="ARDb"/> Doyle and Starr had started song writing together at the end of 1979 using electronic instruments. Their school friend, Loneragan, joined,<ref name="ARDb"/><ref name="retro"/> and in early 1980 Machinations played their first show at Garibaldi's in [[Darlinghurst, New South Wales|Darlinghurst]]. Another school friend, Nero (Nick) Swan, soon joined on bass guitar.<ref name="McF"/><ref name="ARDb"/>

In late 1980, with the assistance of national radio station, [[Triple J]], the band recorded tracks at Trafalgar Studios, for the ''New Music'' program.<ref name="Dempsey 2"/> In November that year they entered a studio with [[Lobby Loyde]] as producer.<ref name="retro"/> The band's debut single, "Average Inadequacy",<ref name="AutoUY-1"/><ref name="Dempsey 2"/> was released on 26 August 1981. Their debut self-titled, four-track extended play, followed on 20 November; both appeared on the independent [[Phantom Records]] label.<ref name="McF"/><ref name="ARDb"/><ref name="Dempsey 2"/> Machinations were managed by SCAM (Suss City Artist Management), which consisted of Sally Collins in partnership with Loyde.<ref name="SCAM"/> SCAM also managed [[The Triffids]], [[Sardine v]], [[The Sunnyboys]], [[Tablewaiters]] and Local Product.<ref name="SCAM"/>

"Average Inadequacy" created interest for [[Mushroom Records]]'s imprint White Records Label to sign the band<ref name="retro"/> and reissue that single with a new B-side, "Machinations of Dance" in March 1982.<ref name="McF"/><ref name="Dempsey 2"/> In February of the next year the group issued a new single, "Jack". It was followed by "Pressure Sway" in June, which peaked at No.&nbsp;21 on the Australian [[Kent Music Report]] Singles Chart during the next month.<ref name="Kent"/><ref name="AusCharts KMR"/> Shelley Dempsey of ''[[The Canberra Times]]'' described it as "probably [the band's] ''piece de resistance'', (or most thrashed song, at least)".<ref name="Dempsey"/> In the United States it reached No.&nbsp;40 on the ''Billboard'' [[Hot Dance Club Songs|Club Play Singles]] chart<ref name="retro"/><ref name="AllMusic"/>{{Citation needed|reason=charting is not found at AllMusic, RetroUniverse supplies the information but is not a reliable source for charting, a more reliable one is needed|date=May 2014}}.

In April 1983 Machinations released their debut album, ''[[Esteem (album)|Esteem]]'', which peaked at No.&nbsp;54 on the Kent Music Report Albums Chart.<ref name="Kent"/><ref name="AusCharts KMR"/> It was produced by [[Russell Dunlop]].<ref name="Cashmere"/>  ''[[Woroni]]'' found that their live show is "tightly paced clever pop music" and that "it's gratifying to see that that punch has found its way on" the "very satisfying and worthwhile album".<ref name="Woroni"/> A later single, "Jumping the Gap", was released in October 1983. Dempsey declared that lead singer, "Loneragan gives a high-powered performance which is probably rivalled only by Midnight Oil's Peter Garrett".<ref name="Dempsey"/> Henry Downes provided percussion at live shows with the band and created the artwork for "Jumping the Gap".

Following the album's release, and an Australian tour supporting [[Joe Jackson (musician)|Joe Jackson]],<ref name="retro"/> Machinations added Warren McLean on drums.<ref name="ARDb"/> Previously they had used a drum machine, [[Roland Corporation|Roland]] [[Roland CR-78|CR-78]]. The band recorded their second album, ''[[Big Music (album)|Big Music]]'', at Rhinoceros Studios using [[Julian Mendelsohn]] as producer.<ref name="McF"/><ref name="ARDb"/><ref name="Ferrington"/> Australian musicologist, [[Ian McFarlane]], declared that the group "[emerged] with the smoothest and most fully realised album of [their] career".<ref name="McF"/><ref name="retro"/> ''Big Music'' appeared on 24 June 1985 and peaked at No.&nbsp;20.<ref name="McF"/><ref name="Kent"/><ref name="AusCharts KMR"/><ref name="Ferrington"/> The album was released in the US on [[A&M Records]].<ref name="AllMusic"/>

''Big Music'' provided three charting singles.<ref name="Kent"/> The lead single, "No Say in It", preceded the album by nine months <U+2013> it was released in September 1984.<ref name="Kent"/> The group found Mendelsohn "was really great to work with" on the single.<ref name="Ferrington"/> They postponed working on the rest of the album until the producer was once again available.<ref name="Ferrington"/> "No Say in It" is the band<U+2019>s highest charting single, it peaked at No.&nbsp;14.<ref name="Kent"/><ref name="AusCharts KMR"/> The second single, "My Heart's on Fire" followed in May 1985, it reached No.&nbsp;27.<ref name="Kent"/><ref name="AusCharts KMR"/> The third single, "You Got Me Going Again", was released in August, which made No.&nbsp;39.<ref name="Kent"/><ref name="AusCharts KMR"/> However the fourth single, "Execution of Love", released in December failed to chart.<ref name="Kent"/> Naomi Star provided backing vocals on most of the album,<ref name="retro"/> although Inez Lawson and Anne Redmond were featured on "No Say in It".<ref name="McF"/><ref name="Big Music"/>

On 13 July [[1985 in music|1985]] Machinations performed three tracks, "Pressure Sway", "My Heart's on Fire", and "No Say in it", for the [[Oz for Africa]] concert (part of the global [[Live Aid]] program).<ref name="OzAfrica"/> It was broadcast in Australia (on both [[Seven Network]] and [[Nine Network]]) and on [[MTV]] in the US.<ref name="OzAfrica"/> The group developed a cult following in dance clubs during the mid-1980s.<ref name="AllMusic"/> ''The Canberra Times''{{'}} Andrew Ferrington felt they "have to be one of the best dance bands in the country at present. And ''Big Music'' is one of the best Australian dance albums about. It captures beat, depth and harmony that could well have eluded the Machis. The second side is by far the better. Led by 'No Say', the four other songs combine to give an exhausting record of the band at its best".<ref name="Ferrington 2"/>

In 1986 White Label issued a mini-album, ''The Big Beat'', a collection of dance remixes of previous singles including, "No Say in It", "Execution of Love", "Pressure Sway" and "You Got Me Going Again", which reached No.&nbsp;83 on the albums chart.<ref name="Kent"/><ref name="AusCharts KMR"/> That year McLean left to join Melbourne funk-pop outfit, [[I'm Talking]].<ref name="McF"/><ref name="ARDb"/> He was replaced on drums, briefly by Downes and more permanently, by John MacKay (ex-Sea Monsters) in early 1987.<ref name="McF"/><ref name="ARDb"/> The band were back in the studios soon after with US producer, [[Andy Wallace (producer)|Andy Wallace]] ([[Prince (musician)|Prince]], [[Run DMC]]), recording a new album.<ref name="McF"/><ref name="ARDb"/>

Their third album, ''[[Uptown (Machinations album)|Uptown]]'', was released in October 1988 and reached No.&nbsp;46.<ref name="Kent"/><ref name="AusCharts KMR"/> It provided four singles over eighteen months. The lead single, "Do to You", had appeared in August 1987, which reached No.&nbsp;15.<ref name="Kent"/><ref name="AusCharts KMR"/> The second single, "Intimacy" (May 1988), reached No.&nbsp;44, the third, "Do It to Me" (October), peaked at No.&nbsp;69 while the fourth, "Cars and Planes" (February 1989), failed to chart.<ref name="Kent"/><ref name="AusCharts KMR"/>

The group had become a popular band on the Australian touring circuit.<ref name="retro"/> Their activities were curtailed in April 1989 when a hit-and-run car accident left Loneragan with a broken neck, multiple cuts, bruises and concussion.<ref name="McF"/><ref name="Injury"/> He spent several months recuperating in hospital. Initially fellow band members intended to continue whilst Loneragan recovered,<ref name="retro"/> however the group disbanded as various members left to join other local groups.<ref name="McF"/><ref name="AllMusic"/> Swan toured with the [[James Freud]]'s band and with MacKay performed in [[Absent Friends (band)|Absent Friends]].<ref name="ARDb"/>

In early 1997 Machinations, with Loneragan, reconvened for live appearances,<ref name="AllMusic"/> which they hoped would lead to new recordings;<ref name="McF"/> however no new material appeared. In September 2006 US label, Almacantar Records, reissued the band's original 1981 EP with one additional track, "Average Inadequacy".<ref name="AutoUY-4"/> Machinations reformed in 2012 and performed two shows at The Bridge Hotel in [[Rozelle, New South Wales|Rozelle]] on 24 and 25 February. On 6 December they gigged at the [[Enmore Theatre]] along with Blondie, and The Stranglers. Machinations planned further shows.
