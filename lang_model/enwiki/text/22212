{{Peerage}}
The '''Privilege of Peerage''' is the body of special privileges belonging to members of the British [[Peerage]], and is distinct from [[Parliamentary privilege]], which applies to only those peers serving in the [[House of Lords]] and the members of the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]], while [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]] is in session and forty days before and after a Parliamentary session.<ref name="so">{{cite web|url=http://www.parliament.the-stationery-office.co.uk/pa/ld/ldcomp/ldctso43.htm#a267|title=Chapter 12 Parliamentary Privilege and Related Matters <U+00A7>12.13|work=Companion to the Standing Orders and guide to the Proceedings of the House of Lords|publisher=The United Kingdom Parliament|date=19 February 2007|accessdate=2007-10-19}}</ref>

The Privilege of Peerage extends to all temporal peers and peeresses regardless of their position in relation to the House of Lords. The right to sit in the House is separate to the privilege, and is only held by some peers (see [[History of Lords Reform]]). [[Peerage of Scotland|Scottish peers]] from the [[Acts of Union 1707]] and [[Peerage of Ireland|Irish peers]] from the [[Act of Union 1800]], therefore, have the Privilege of Peerage. From 1800, Irish peers have had the right to stand for election to the [[British House of Commons|United Kingdom House of Commons]] but they lose the privilege of peerage for the duration of their service in the lower House.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.statutelaw.gov.uk/content.aspx?LegType=All+Primary&PageNumber=104&NavFrom=2&parentActiveTextDocId=1473067&activetextdocid=1473081#comref-887699|title=Act of Union (Ireland) 1800 (c.38)|publisher=The UK Statute Law Database|accessdate=2007-11-07}}</ref> Since 1999, hereditary peers of [[Peerage of England|England]], Scotland, [[Peerage of Great Britain|Great Britain]] and the [[Peerage of the United Kingdom|United Kingdom]], who are not members of the House of Lords, may stand for election to the House of Commons. Their privilege of peerage is not explicitly lost by service in the lower House. Any peer issuing a disclaimer under the provisions of the [[Peerage Act 1963]] loses all privileges of peerage.<ref name="so"/> The Privilege of Peerage also extends to wives and widows of peers. A peeress by [[marriage]] loses the privilege upon marrying a commoner,<ref name="so"/> but a peeress ''[[suo jure]]'' does not. Individuals who hold [[courtesy title]]s, however, do not have such privileges by virtue of those titles. [[Lord Spiritual|Lords Spiritual]] (the 26 Archbishops and Bishops who sit in the House of Lords) do not have the Privilege of Peerage as, at least since 1621, they have been Lords of Parliament, and not peers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.parliament.the-stationery-office.co.uk/pa/ld/ldstords/147/14702.htm#a7 |title=Standing Orders Of The House Of Lords Relating To Public Business: No. 6|publisher=The House of Lords|date=16 July 2007|accessdate=2007-10-31}}</ref>

The privileges have been lost and eroded over time. Only three survived into the 20th century: the right to be tried by other [[peers of the realm]] instead of [[jury|juries]] of [[commoner]]s, freedom from arrest in civil (but not criminal) cases, and access to the Sovereign to advise him or her on matters of state.<ref name="so"/> The right to be tried by other peers was abolished in 1948. Legal opinion considers the right of freedom from arrest as obsolete. The remaining privilege was recommended for formal abolition in 1999,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.parliament.the-stationery-office.co.uk/pa/jt199899/jtselect/jtpriv/43/4304.htm#note41|title=Summary of Recommendations|work=Joint Committee on Parliamentary Privilege - First Report|publisher=United Kingdom Parliament|date=9 April 1999|accessdate=2007-11-07|isbn=0-10-432799-5}}</ref> and may be retained, arguably, by peers whether members of the [[House of Lords]] or not.<ref>Noel Cox, Professor of Law at Auckland University of Technology, quoted in [http://www.hereditarypeers.com/newsletter.htm ''Journal of the Hereditary Peerage Association. No. 5''] 1 April 2007. Retrieved on 2007-11-08.</ref>

Peers also have several other rights that do not formally comprise the Privilege of Peerage. For example, they are entitled to use coronets and supporters on their [[heraldry|achievements of arms]].

==Trial by peers==
[[Image:House of Lords Microcosm edited.jpg|thumb|The House of Lords, ''circa'' 1810]]
Just as commoners have a right to trial by a jury of their equals (other commoners), peers and peeresses formerly had a right to trial by other peers. The right of peers to trial by their own order was formalized during the fourteenth century. A statute passed in 1341 provided:<ref>15 Edward III., st. 1, sec. 2. quoted in [[Lysander Spooner|Spooner, Lysander]] (1852). [http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/1201 "An Essay on the Trial by Jury."] Boston: Hobart and Robbins. Retrieved on 2007-10-19.</ref>
:Whereas before this time the peers of the land have been arrested and imprisoned, and their temporalities, lands, and tenements, goods and cattels, asseized in the King's hands, and some put to death without judgment of their peers: It is accorded and assented, that no peer of the land&nbsp;... shall be brought in judgment to lose his temporalities, lands, tenements, goods and cattels, nor to be arrested, imprisoned, outlawed, exiled, nor forejudged, nor put to answer, nor be judged, but by award of the said peers in Parliament.
The privilege of trial by peers was still ill-defined, and the statute did not cover peeresses. In 1442, after an ecclesiastical court (which included King [[Henry VI of England]], [[Henry Beaufort]] and [[John Kemp]]) found [[Eleanor Cobham|Eleanor, Duchess of Gloucester]] guilty of [[witchcraft]] and banished her to the [[Isle of Man]], a statute was enacted granting peeresses the right of trial by peers.<ref name="lovell">{{citation|author=Lovell, C. R.|title=The Trial of Peers in Great Britain|journal=The American Historical Review|volume=55|pages=69<U+2013>81|date=October 1949}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|author=Pike, L. O.|title=A Constitutional History of the House of Lords|publisher=Macmillan|location=London|year=1894|pages=215<U+2013>217}}</ref>

By the reign of [[Henry VII of England]], there were two methods of trial by Peers of the Realm: trial in the House of Lords (or, in proper terms, by the High Court of Parliament) and trial in the Court of the [[Lord High Steward]]. The House of Lords tried the case if Parliament was in session; otherwise, trial was by the Lord High Steward's Court.<ref>Pike, pp.218<U+2013>227</ref> In both cases, the Lord High Steward presided. Before the trial, a peer would be indicted by a [[Grand Jury]], as was normally done with commoners, but instead of being decided by the [[Assize Court]]s, the Lord High Steward's Court or Parliament would issue a [[writ of certiorari]] ordering the lower court to certify the case up to it. 

In the House of Lords, the Lord High Steward was the President or Chairman of the Court, but the entire House determined both questions of fact and questions of law. At the end of the trial, peers voted on the question before them, starting with the most junior [[baron]] and proceeding in order of precedence, ending with the Lord High Steward himself, by standing and declaring the verdict on their honour<U+2014>not on oath, as is the case in juries trying commoners. By convention, [[Bishop]]s and [[Archbishop]]s did not vote on the verdict, though they were able to cast votes on procedural questions arising during the course of the trial. Instead, they sat until the conclusion of the deliberations, withdrawing from the chamber just prior to the final vote. All decisions were by simple majority, provided that at least twelve peers voted. The entire House also determined the punishment to be imposed, which had to accord with the law. For capital crimes the punishment was death; the last peer to be executed was [[Laurence Shirley, 4th Earl Ferrers]], who was hanged for murder in 1760.

In the Lord High Steward's Court, the Lord High Steward functioned as a [[judge]], determining questions of law, while a group of Lords Triers, essentially a jury composed of other peers, decided questions of fact and the verdict. By custom the number of Triers was not fewer than 23, so that a majority was a minimum of 12, but in fact the number ranged from 20 to 35.<ref name="lovell"/> The power to choose which peers served as Triers lay with the Crown and was sometimes subject to abuse, as only those peers who agreed with the monarch's position would be summoned to the Court of the Lord High Steward, thereby favouring the desired verdict. This practice was ended by the Treasons Act, passed during the reign of King [[William III of England|William III]]. The Act required that all peers be summoned as triers. All subsequent trials were held before the full High Court of Parliament.

From 1547 if a peer or peeress was convicted of a crime, except treason or murder, he or she could claim "privilege of peerage" to escape punishment if it was their first offence. In all, the privilege was exercised five times,<ref>[[Baron Morley]] found guilty of manslaughter in 1666; the [[Earl of Pembroke]] found guilty of manslaughter in 1678; the [[Earl of Warwick|Earl of Warwick and Holland]] found guilty of manslaughter in 1699; [[William Byron, 5th Baron Byron|Lord Byron]] found guilty of manslaughter in 1765; and the [[Elizabeth Pierrepont, Duchess of Kingston-upon-Hull|Duchess of Kingston]] found guilty of bigamy in 1776.</ref> until it was formally abolished in 1841 when [[James Brudenell, 7th Earl of Cardigan]] announced he would claim the privilege and avoid punishment if he was convicted of duelling. He was acquitted before the introduction of the bill.<ref name="lovell"/>

The last trial in the House of Lords was that of [[Edward Southwell Russell, 26th Baron de Clifford]] in 1935 for motor manslaughter (he was acquitted); the following year the Lords passed a bill to abolish trial by peers but the Commons ignored it. In 1948, the right to trial by peers was abolished when the Lords added an amendment to the Criminal Justice Act, which the Commons accepted.<ref name="lovell"/> Now, peers are tried by juries composed of commoners, though they were themselves excluded from jury service until the passage of the [[House of Lords Act 1999]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/acts/en1999/1999en34.htm|title=Explanatory Notes to House Of Lords Act 1999|publisher=[[Her Majesty's Stationery Office]]|date=15 November 1999|accessdate=2007-11-07}}</ref>

Peers were, and still are hypothetically, subject to [[impeachment]]. Impeachment was a procedure distinct from the aforementioned procedure of trial in the House of Lords, though the House of Lords is the court in both cases. Charges were brought by the House of Commons, not a Grand Jury. Additionally, while in normal cases the House of Lords tried peers only for felonies or treason, in impeachments the charges could include felonies, treason and misdemeanours. The case directly came before the House of Lords, rather than being referred to it by a [[writ of certiorari]]. The Lord High Steward presided only if a peer was charged with high treason; otherwise the Lord Chancellor presided. Other procedures in trials of impeachment were similar, however, to trials before the House of Lords: at the conclusion of the trial, the spiritual peers withdrew, and the temporal Lords gave their votes on their honour. The last impeachment was that of [[Henry Dundas, 1st Viscount Melville]] in 1806 for misappropriating public money (he was acquitted).<ref>{{cite web|author=Gay, Oonagh|url=http://www.parliament.uk/commons/lib/research/notes/snpc-02666.pdf|title=Impeachment|publisher=House of Commons|date=30 November 2004|format=pdf|accessdate=2007-11-15}}</ref> Since then, impeachment has become an obsolete procedure in the United Kingdom.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.parliament.the-stationery-office.co.uk/pa/jt199899/jtselect/jtpriv/43/4305.htm|title=Chapter 1: The Need for a Review|work=Joint Committee on Parliamentary Privilege - First Report|publisher=United Kingdom Parliament|date=30 March 1999|accessdate=2007-11-07}}</ref>

==Access to the Sovereign==
The Sovereign is advised by various counsellors, including the Peers of the Realm. Peers formed the ''magnum concilium'', or Great Council, which was one of the four councils belonging to the Sovereign. The other three were the [[Privy Council]], Parliament (which is called the ''commune concilium'', or Common Council), and judges (who are considered counsellors of the Sovereign on legal matters).

A council composed only of peers was often summoned by some early English Kings. Such a council, having been in disuse for centuries, was revived in 1640, when [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] summoned all of the Peers of the Realm using writs issued under the [[Great Seal of the Realm|Great Seal]]. Though such a council has not been summoned since then, and was considered obsolete at the time, each peer is commonly considered a counsellor of the Sovereign, and, according to [[William Blackstone|Sir William Blackstone]] in 1765, "it is usually looked upon to be the right of each particular peer of the realm, to demand an audience of the King, and to lay before him, with decency and respect, such matters as he shall judge of importance to the [[public weal]]."<ref>[[William Blackstone|Blackstone, W.]] (1765). [http://www.lonang.com/exlibris/blackstone/bla-105.htm ''Commentaries on the Laws of England''. Book 1, Chapter 5] Oxford: Clarendon Press.</ref> This privilege is no longer exercised.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dodonline.co.uk/engine.asp?lev1=0&lev2=0&menu=16&showPage=article&ID=118|title=History of Parliament. Part 1: The House of Lords and the Peerage|publisher=Dods|year=2007|accessdate=2007-11-09}}</ref>

==Freedom from arrest==
The privilege of freedom from [[arrest]] applies to members of both Houses of Parliament<ref name="so"/> due to the principle that they must, whenever possible, be available to give advice to the Sovereign. Several other nations have copied this provision; the [[Constitution of the United States]], for example, provides, "The Senators and Representatives&nbsp;... shall in all Cases, except Treason, Felony and Breach of the Peace, be privileged from Arrest during their Attendance at the Session of their respective Houses." Theoretically, even when Parliament is not sitting peers enjoy the privilege because they continue to serve the Sovereign as counsellors. Peers are free from arrest in civil cases only however; arrests in criminal matters are not covered by the privilege. Until 1770, a peer's domestic servants were also covered by the privilege of freedom from arrest in civil matters.<ref>{{citation|author=Turberville, A. S.|title=The 'Protection' of Servants of Members of Parliament|journal=[[The English Historical Review]]|date=October 1927|publisher=Oxford University Press|volume=42|pages=590<U+2013>600}}</ref>

Most often the privilege was applied in cases of imprisonment in [[Debtors' Prison]]s. In 1870, both imprisonment for debt and the privilege in relation to freedom from arrest for bankruptcy were abolished, and as a result the freedom became extremely limited in practical application. Now, civil proceedings involve arrests only when an individual disobeys a court order. Since 1945, the privilege of freedom from arrest in civil cases has only arisen in two cases: ''[[Stourton v Stourton]]'' (1963) and ''[[Peden International Transport, Moss Bros, The Rowe Veterinary Group and Barclays Bank plc v Lord Mancroft]]'' (1989).<ref name="so"/> In the latter most recent case, the trial judge considered the privilege obsolete and inapplicable, and said in proceedings, "the privilege did not apply<U+2014>indeed&nbsp;... it is unthinkable in modern times that, in circumstances such as they are in this case, it should".<ref>{{cite web|title=Memorandum by Mr Geoffrey Lock|url=http://www.parliament.the-stationery-office.co.uk/pa/jt199899/jtselect/jtpriv/43/43ap16.htm|work=Joint Committee on Parliamentary Privilege - First Report: Volume 3 Written Evidence|date=9 April 1999|publisher=United Kingdom Parliament|accessdate=2007-11-07|isbn=0-10-432699-9}}</ref>

==''Scandalum magnatum''==
At one time, the honour of peers was especially protected by the law; while defamation of a commoner was known as [[slander and libel|libel or slander]], the defamation of a peer (or of a [[Great Officer of State]]) was called ''scandalum magnatum''. The [[Statutes of Westminster|Statute of Westminster]] of 1275 provided that "from henceforth none be so hardy to tell or publish any false News or Tales, whereby discord, or occasion of discord or slander may grow between the King and his People, or the Great Men of the Realm."<ref>3 Edw. 1, Stat. Westm. prim. c. 34 quoted in [http://www.lexum.umontreal.ca/csc-scc/en/pub/1992/vol2/texte/1992scr2_0731.txt''R. v. Z<U+00FC>ndel''.

During the reign of [[Henry VII of England|Henry VII]], the [[Star Chamber]], a court formerly reserved for trial of serious offences such as rioting, assumed jurisdiction over ''scandalum magnatum'', as well as libel and slander, cases. The court, which sat without a jury and in secret, was often used as a political weapon and a device of royal tyranny, leading to its abolition in 1641; its functions in respect of defamation cases passed to the common law courts. Already, however, the number of cases had dwindled as the laws of libel, slander and contempt of court developed in its place. By the end of the eighteenth century, ''scandalum magnatum'' was obsolete. The prohibition on it was finally repealed by the [[Statute Law Revision Act 1887]].<ref>Statute Law Revision Act, 1887 (U.K.), 50 & 51 Vict., c. 59 quoted in [http://www.lexum.umontreal.ca/csc-scc/en/pub/1992/vol2/texte/1992scr2_0731.txt''R. v.

==Privilege myths==
Several individuals have written fanciful tales of peers with whimsical privileges, such as the right to wear a hat in the presence of the Sovereign; the most notorious example of such a legend is that of the [[Baron Kingsale|Kingsale]] hat. According to the fable, [[John de Courcy]], [[Earl of Ulster]], obtained from King [[John of England|John]] the privilege of remaining covered (that is, wearing a hat) in the presence of the Sovereign. Though the tale is untrue<U+2014>de Courcy was never made an earl<ref>{{citation|author=Duffy, Se<U+00E1>n|title=Courcy , John de (d. 1219?)|journal=Oxford Dictionary of National Biography|publisher=Oxford University Press|date=2004|url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/6443|accessdate=2008-02-08|doi=10.1093/ref:odnb/6443}} (Subscription required)</ref> and did not receive such a privilege<U+2014>several authorities on the Peerage have seen fit to repeat it. A 19th-century edition of ''[[Burke's Peerage]]'' suggests the origins of the privilege:<ref>''A Genealogical and heraldic dictionary of the peerage and baronetage of the British Empire.'' 1880 ed. p.702 (''sub'' Kingsale); changed by the 85th edition of 1927.</ref>

:... the Earl of Ulster was treacherously seized while performing penance, unarmed and barefooted, in the churchyard of Downpatrick, on [[Good Friday]], anno 1203, and sent over to England, where the king condemned him to perpetual imprisonment in the [[Tower of London|Tower]]&nbsp;... After de Courcy had been in confinement about a year, a dispute happening to arise between King John and Philip Augustus of France concerning the Duchy of [[Normandy]], the decision of which being referred to single combat, King John, more hasty than advised, appointed the day, against which the King of France provided his champion; but the King of England, less fortunate, could find no one of his subjects willing to take up the gauntlet, until his captive in the Tower, the stout Earl of Ulster, was prevailed upon to accept the challenge. But when everything was prepared for the contest, and the champions had entered the lists, in presence of the Kings of England, France and Spain, the opponent of the earl, seized with a sudden panic, put spurs to his horse, and fled the arena; whereupon the victory was adjudged by acclamation to the champion of England. The French king being informed, however, of the earl's powerful strength, and wishing to witness some exhibition of it, de Courcy, at the desire of King John, cleft a massive helmet in twain at a single blow. 

To reward his singular performance, King John supposedly granted de Courcy the privilege of remaining covered in the presence of the Sovereign. The 1823 edition of [[Debrett's Peerage]] gives an entirely fictitious account of how [[Almericus de Courcy, 23rd Baron Kingsale]], asserted the privilege:<ref>Quoted at [http://www.baronage.co.uk/bphtm-02/moa-03.html Mists of Antiquity Chapter 3: Debrett's and Burke's.] The Baronage Press Ltd and Pegasus Associates Ltd. Retrieved on 2007-10-19.</ref>

:Being very handsome in his person, and of a tall stature, his lordship one day attended King William's court, and being admitted into the presence-chamber, asserted the privilege of being covered before his majesty, by walking to and fro with his hat on his head. The king observing him, sent one of his attendants to inquire the reason of his appearance before him with his head covered; to whom he replied, he knew very well in whose presence he stood, and the reason why he wore his hat that day was, because he stood before the king of England. This answer being told the king, and his lordship approaching nearer the throne, was required by his majesty to explain himself, which he did to this effect: "May it please your majesty, my name is Courcy, and I am Lord of Kingsale in your kingdom of [[Ireland]]: the reason of my appearing covered in your majesty's presence is, to assert the ancient privilege of my family, granted to sir John de Courcy, earl of Ulster, and his heirs, by John, king of England, for him and his successors for ever." The king replied, he remembered he had such a nobleman, and believed the privilege he asserted to be his right, and giving him his hand to kiss, his lordship paid his obeisance, and remained covered.

De Courcy not only did not procure such a privilege, but he also was never created Earl of Ulster.<ref>[[Complete Peerage]], Vol. XII, part 2; pp. 166<U+2013>169. He was granted all the ''land'' of Ulster, and promised the Earldom; but the first [[Earl of Ulster]] was Hugh de Lacy, his enemy, who was granted both land and Earldom when King John quarrelled with Courci; Lacy witnessed a document as Earl 24 July 1205.</ref> Despite such inaccuracies, the tale has been frequently repeated, and provides an instructive example of the fictional privileges often attributed to peers.

==Precedence==
{{main|United Kingdom order of precedence}}
Peers are entitled to a special [[precedence]] because of their ranks. Wives and children of peers are also entitled to a special precedence because of their station.

The Sovereign may, as [[fount of honour]], vary the precedence of the peers or of any other people. For example, [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Elizabeth II]] granted her husband, [[Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh|HRH The Duke of Edinburgh]], precedence immediately following her; otherwise, he would have ranked along with the other dukes of the Peerage of the United Kingdom.<ref name="velde">Velde, Fran<U+00E7>ois R. (2007). [http://www.heraldica.org/topics/britain/order_precedence.htm "Order of Precedence in England and Wales."] Retrieved on 2007-10-19.</ref>

===General precedence===
In England and Wales, the Sovereign ranks first, followed by the Royal Family. Then follow the [[Archbishop of Canterbury|Archbishops of Canterbury]] and [[Archbishop of York|York]], the Great Officers of State and other important state functionaries such as the [[Prime Minister]]. Thereafter, dukes precede [[marquess]]es, who precede [[earl]]s, who precede [[viscount]]s, who precede Bishops, who precede barons and lords of Parliament.<ref name="velde"/>

Within the members of each rank of the Peerage, peers of England precede peers of [[Scotland]]. English and Scottish peers together precede peers of Great Britain. All of the aforementioned precede peers of Ireland created before 1801. Last come peers of Ireland created after 1801 and peers of the United Kingdom. Among peers of the same rank and Peerage, precedence is based on the creation of the title: those whose titles were created earlier precede those whose titles were created later. But in no case would a peer of a lower rank precede one of a higher rank. For example, the [[Duke of Fife]], the last non-royal to be created a duke, would come before the [[Marquess of Winchester]], though the latter's title was created earlier and is in a more senior peerage (the Peerage of England).<ref name="velde"/>

The place of a peer in the order for gentlemen is taken by his wife in the order for ladies, except that a Dowager peeress of a particular title precedes the present holder of the same title. Children of peers (and ''suo jure'' peeresses) also obtain a special precedence. The following algorithm may be used to determine their ranks:
*Eldest sons of peers of rank X go after peers of rank X&minus;1
*Younger sons of peers of rank X go after eldest sons of peers of rank X&minus;1
*Wives have a precedence corresponding to those of their husbands
*Daughters of peers of rank X go after wives of eldest sons of peers of rank X
Over time, however, various offices were inserted at different points in the order, thereby varying it.<ref name="velde"/>

Eldest sons of dukes rank after marquesses; eldest sons of marquesses and then younger sons of dukes rank after earls; eldest sons of earls and then younger sons of marquesses rank after viscounts. Eldest sons of viscounts, younger sons of earls, and then eldest sons of barons, in that order, follow barons, with the [[Treasurer]] of the Household, the [[Comptroller of the Household]], the Vice-Chamberlain of the Household and Secretaries of State being interpolated between them and the barons. Younger sons of viscounts, and then younger sons of barons, come after the aforesaid eldest sons of barons, with Knights of the [[Order of the Garter]] and [[Order of the Thistle]], [[Privy Council]]lors and senior judges being intercalated between them and eldest sons of barons.<ref name="velde"/>

Children of the eldest son of a peer also obtain a special precedence. Generally, the eldest son of the eldest son of a peer comes immediately before his uncles, while the younger sons of the eldest son of a peer come after them. Therefore, eldest sons of eldest sons of dukes come before younger sons of dukes, and younger sons of eldest sons of dukes come after them, and so forth for all the ranks. Below the younger sons of barons are baronets, knights, circuit judges and companions of the various orders of Chivalry, followed by the eldest sons of younger sons of peers.<ref name="velde"/>

Wives of all of the aforementioned have precedence corresponding to their husbands', unless otherwise entitled to a higher precedence, for instance by virtue of holding a certain office. An individual's daughter takes precedence after the wife of that individual's eldest son and before the wives of that individual's younger sons. Therefore, daughters of peers rank immediately after wives of eldest sons of peers; daughters of eldest sons of peers rank immediately after wives of eldest sons of eldest sons of peers; daughters of younger sons of peers rank after wives of eldest sons of younger sons of peers. Such a daughter keeps her precedence if marrying a commoner (unless that marriage somehow confers a higher precedence), but rank as their husband if marrying a peer.<ref name="velde"/>

===Precedence within Parliament===
The order of precedence used to determine seating in the House of Lords chamber is governed by an Act of Parliament passed in 1539.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.statutelaw.gov.uk/content.aspx?LegType=Act+(Old+English+Parliament)&searchEnacted=0&extentMatchOnly=0&confersPower=0&blanketAmendment=0&sortAlpha=0&PageNumber=1&NavFrom=0&parentActiveTextDocId=1517994&ActiveTextDocId=1517994&filesize=14887|title=House of Lords Precedence Act 1539 (c. 10)|publisher=The UK Statute Law Database|accessdate=2007-10-22}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.parliament.the-stationery-office.co.uk/pa/ld/ldstords/147/14703.htm|title=Standing Orders Of The House Of Lords Relating To Public Business: Appendix|publisher=The House of Lords|date=16 July 2007|accessdate=2007-10-22}}</ref> Precedence as provided by the Act is similar to, but not the same as, the order outside Parliament. The Sovereign, however, does not have the authority to change the precedence assigned by the Act.<ref name="velde"/>

Lords Temporal assume precedence similar to precedence outside Parliament. One difference in the precedence of peers relates to the positions of the Great Officers of State and the officers of the Sovereign's Household. Some Great Officers<U+2014>the Lord Chancellor, the [[Lord High Treasurer]], the [[Lord President of the Council]] and the [[Lord Privy Seal]]<U+2014>provided they are peers, rank before all other peers except those who are of the Blood Royal (no precedence is accorded if they are not peers). The positions of the other Great Officers<U+2014>the [[Lord Great Chamberlain]], the [[Lord High Constable]], the [[Earl Marshal]] and the [[Lord High Admiral]]<U+2014>and the officers of the Household<U+2014>the [[Lord Steward]] and the [[Lord Chamberlain]]<U+2014>are based on their respective ranks. Thus, if the Lord Steward were a duke, he would precede all dukes, if a marquess, he would precede all marquesses, and so on. If two such officers are of the same rank, the precedence of the offices (reflected by the order in which they are mentioned above) is taken into account: if the Lord Great Chamberlain and Earl Marshal were both marquesses, for example, then the Great Chamberlain would precede the Earl Marshal, as the former office precedes the latter.<ref name="velde"/>

In practice, however, the Act is obsolete, as the Lords do not actually sit according to strict precedence; instead, peers sit with their political parties.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.parliament.the-stationery-office.co.uk/pa/ld/ldcomp/ldctso03.htm#a11|title=Chapter 1 The House and Its Membership <U+00A7>1.32<U+2013>1.36|work=Companion to the Standing Orders and guide to the Proceedings of the House of Lords|publisher=The United Kingdom Parliament|date=19 February 2007|accessdate=2007-10-31}}</ref>

==Coats of Arms==
{{COA elements}}
Peers are generally entitled to use certain [[coats of arms|heraldic devices]]. Atop the arms, a peer may display a [[coronet]]. Dukes were the first individuals authorised to wear [[coronet]]s. Marquesses acquired coronets in the 15th century, earls in the 16th and viscounts and barons in the 17th. Until the barons received coronets in 1661, the coronets of earls, marquesses and dukes were [[engraving|engraved]] while those of viscounts were plain. After 1661, however, viscomital coronets became engraved, while baronial coronets were plain. Coronets may not bear any precious or semi-precious stones.<ref name="cox">Cox, Noel (1999). [http://www.geocities.com/noelcox/coronets.htm "The Coronets of Members of the Royal Family and of the Peerage."] ''The Double Tressure, the Journal of The Heraldry Society of Scotland''. No. 22, pp. 8<U+2013>13. Retrieved on 2007-10-19.</ref> Generally, only peers may use the coronets corresponding to their ranks. The [[Bishop of Durham]], however, may use a duke's coronet atop the arms as a reference to the historical temporal authority of the [[Bishop of Durham|Prince-Bishops of Durham]]. 

Peers wear their coronets at coronations. Otherwise, coronets are only seen in heraldic representations, atop a peer's arms. Coronets include a silver [[gilding|gilt]] [[chaplet]] and a base of [[ermine]] [[fur]]. The coronet varies with the rank of the peer. A member of the [[Royal Family]] uses a royal coronet instead of the coronet he or she would use as a peer or peeress.<ref name="cox"/>

Ducal coronets include eight strawberry leaves atop the chaplet, five of which are displayed in heraldic representations. Marquesses have coronets with four strawberry leaves alternating with four silver balls, of which three leaves and two balls are displayed. Coronets for earls have eight strawberry leaves alternating with eight silver balls (called "pearls" even though they are not) raised on spikes, of which five silver balls and four leaves are displayed. Coronets for viscounts have 16 silver balls, of which seven are displayed. Finally, baronial coronets have six silver balls, of which four are displayed. Peeresses use equivalent designs, but in the form of a [[circlet]], which encircles the head, rather than a coronet, which rests atop the head.<ref name="cox"/>

Peers are entitled to the use of [[supporter]]s in their achievements of arms. Hereditary supporters are normally limited to hereditary peers, certain members of the Royal Family, chiefs of Scottish Clans, Scottish feudal barons whose baronies predate 1587. Non-hereditary supporters are granted to life peers, [[Order of the Garter|Knights of the Garter]], [[Order of the Thistle|Knights of the Thistle]], [[Order of the Bath|Knights Grand Cross of the Bath]] and [[Order of St Michael and St George|Knights Grand Cross of St Michael and St George]], and [[Knight banneret|knights banneret]]. 

Peers, like most other armigers, may display [[helm]]s atop their arms. Helms of peers are depicted in silver and facing the viewer's left. The helm is garnished in gold and the closed visor has gold bars, normally numbering five. Along with the helm, peers use a [[mantling]], one side of which is red and the other a representation of the heraldic fur ermine. The mantling of peers is emblazoned ''gules, doubled ermine''. Peeresses and other female armigers do not bear helms or mantlings.<ref>For all this section see, for example, Sir [[Bernard Burke]]'s ''General Armoury'' (1884) pp. xv<U+2013>xx.</ref>

==Robes==

Peers have special robes that are worn at coronations and during certain special Parliamentary occasions, such as the [[State Opening of Parliament]]. The robes have special designs based on the rank of the peer. The coronation robes and coronets used at Elizabeth II's coronation in 1953 cost about <U+00A3>1,250<ref name="arma">Cox, Noel (1999). [http://www.geocities.com/noelcox/Peers_Robes.htm "The Coronation and Parliamentary Robes of the British Peerage."] ''Arma, the Journal of the Heraldry Society of Southern Africa''. Vol. 5, no. 1, pp. 289<U+2013>293. Retrieved on 2007-10-19.</ref> (roughly <U+00A3>{{Formatprice|{{Inflation|UK|1250|1953}}|-2}} in present-day terms).{{Inflation-fn|UK}}

Coronation robes of peers include crimson velvet cloaks extending to the feet, open in the front and trailing behind. The robes also include a hood and a cape of miniver. The rank of the peer is demonstrated by bars of sealskin spots on the cape: Royal dukes have six, other dukes four, marquesses three and a half, earls three, viscounts two and a half, and barons two. The rank of peeresses (female peers and wives of male peers) is denoted differently, by the length of the train. Duchesses have two-yard trains, marchionesses one and three quarters, countesses one and a half, viscountesses one and a quarter, and baronesses and female holders of lordships of Parliament one.<ref name="arma"/>

The Parliamentary robe of peers is full-length, made of scarlet [[wool]] and includes a collar of white miniver fur. Miniver bars indicate the rank of the wearer as with coronation robes.<ref name="arma"/> Such robes are worn by members of the Peerage at occasions such as [[Introduction (House of Lords)|introductions]] and State Openings of Parliament.
