'''Parkwood Hills''' is a [[List of Ottawa neighbourhoods|neighborhood]] in [[River Ward]] and [[Knoxdale-Merivale Ward]], located in [[Nepean, Ontario]].  It is notable for the thriller ''Parkwood Hills'' (2002) which was filmed on location in the area by Kolin Casagrande, and for being a typical and illustrative example of [[Architecture of Ottawa#Urban planning|town planning]] and [[subdivision (land)|development]] by [[Minto Group|Minto]] in the context of its position as the [[property manager]] for the [[National Capital Commission]].

== Location ==
Central to this [[subdivision (land)|development]] is the street, Meadowlands Drive, bounded to the east by Fisher Avenue and to the west by Merivale Road. [http://www.flickr.com/photos/29143375@N05/3484518224 Image]. It is in [[River Ward]], and also in [[Knoxdale-Merivale Ward]] which was expanded in 2006.<ref>[http://www.gordhunter.ca/pdf.php?doc=5 Gordhunter.ca: about Knoxdale-Merivale ward.]</ref> The councillor for [[River Ward|River]] is [[Maria McRae]],<ref>[http://ottawa.ca/city_hall/mayor_council/councillors/m_mcrae_en.html City of Ottawa: Marie McRae webpage.]</ref> and for [[Knoxdale-Merivale Ward|Knoxdale Merivale]] it is [[Gord Hunter]].<ref>[http://ottawa.ca/city_hall/mayor_council/councillors/g_hunter_en.html City of Ottawa: Gord Hunter webpage.]</ref>

== History of the area ==

=== Before 1959 ===

It is known that at least some of this land was farmland, since the Mulvagh farmhouse was here. The farmhouse was later taken over by the Parkwood Presbyterian Church.<ref Name=presbyterian>[http://www.parkwoodchurch.ca/history.html Parkwood Presbyterian Church: History.]</ref> Farming was challenging in some respects, due to the [[Great Depression|Depression]], animal predation<ref Name=animalcontrol>[http://www.ottawa.ca/residents/rural_connections/livestock/wildlife_en.html City of Ottawa website: wild animal control.]</ref><ref>[http://www.omafra.gov.on.ca/english/livestock/sheep/predator.html Ontario website: sheep predator control.]</ref> and fire risk.<ref>[http://www.ottawa.ca/residents/fire/prev_education/farm_fire_en.html City of Ottawa website: farm fires page.]</ref>

=== Development from 1959 ===
Parkwood Hills is the name given to a residential development to the east of the section of [[Ottawa]] known as [[Nepean, Ontario|Nepean]]. One possible source for the name is Parkwood Hill, the fictional suburban setting for the 1948-1969 [[UK]] radio series ''[[Mrs Dale's Diary]]''. 

It is a mixed-dwelling [[suburb]], having [[tower block|apartment block]]s, [[townhouse]]s and an assortment of single family houses. The [[subdivision (land)|development]] is largely the work of the building company, [[Minto Group|Minto]], which maintains ownership of much of the multi-residence buildings.<ref>[http://www.minto.com/index.html Minto Group website]</ref> The tract has been developed over the past half-century and is largely complete.<ref>Information from local residents.</ref> The development was planned by architect John Russell in 1959.  He was influenced by Californian community layouts and house models,<ref>[http://www.crystalbeachlakeview.ca/did_you_know.htm Crystal Beach Lakeview Community Association webpage.]</ref> but see [[Architecture of Ottawa#Urban planning|Ottawa urban planning]].  The building took place between 1959 and 1972.<ref>[http://209.85.229.132/search?q=cache:LmR6q3kg5u8J:www.stmarksottawa.ca/annex/50anniversary.html+minto+parkwood+hills+development&cd=8&hl=en&ct=clnk&gl=uk St Marks Anglican Church memories 1949-1999 by Lorne Bowerman, Chapter 1]</ref>

<blockquote>
''Suburban development flourished in the 1950s and '60s, with Ottawa companies, including [[Minto Group|Minto]] and [[Campeau Corporation]] building slews of suburban singles in Elmvale Acres, Parkwood Hills and similar areas, many of them in the 1,200-square-foot range''.<ref>[http://www.househunting.ca/condos/story.html?id=4e61d692-03f8-4d88-aa59-d23b4a933bdb&p=3 Househunting.ca: ''Small is the new big''.]</ref>
</blockquote>

=== Movie ===

The movie ''Parkwood Hills'' was made on location here in 2002 by Kolin Casagrande, who later produced ''The Walkers'' in 2004.<ref>[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0428947/ IMDb: ''Parkwood Hills'' (2002)] and [http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0452893/ ''The Walkers'' (2004)]</ref> It is a "short [[horror film]], made as part of a project that assigned filmmakers to make short films with a horror theme," and was shown as part of a [[Halloween]] entertainment in [[Ottawa]] in 2007.<ref>[http://www.canada.com/cityguides/ottawa/story.html?id=488bc164-1041-4aad-9098-3e01d7388ea1&k=45229 Canada.com: Phantoms, Exorcists etc.]</ref> Since the plot centres on the fears of a babysitter, it possibly falls into the [[horror-of-personality]] sub-genre.

== For children ==

=== Schools ===
Public schools in [[Nepean, Ontario|Nepean]] are administered by [[Ottawa-Carleton District School Board]]. Catholic schools are administered by the [[Ottawa-Carleton Catholic School Board]]. Amalgamation of some schools has been recently recommended, due to a fall in student numbers.<ref>[http://www.yournepean.com/article/13106 YourNepean.com: Committee recommends school amalgamations, May 20 2009.]</ref>

Des Laurier High School has an active [[basketball]] team which played a friendly against the local police in May 2009.<ref>[http://www.ottawapolice.ca/en/outreach/community_partnerships/news_police_week.cfm Ottawapolice.ca: Friendly against Des Laurier HS]</ref> Parkwood Hills Public School won a Health Pennant from the Ministry of Health on 4 May 2007,<ref>[http://www.mhp.gov.on.ca/english/news/2007/050407-3.asp Ministry of Health: Parkwood Hills Public School receives healthy schools pennant.]</ref><ref>[http://esip.edu.gov.on.ca/english/profiles/school_info.asp?ID=B66184&schoolid=436488 Ontario Ministry of Education: Parkwood Hills Public School (elementary).]</ref> and took part in the Who is Nobody program in 2009.<ref>[http://www.yournepean.com/article/11065 YourNepean.com: Parkwood students turn Nobody into Somebody, March 18, 2009.]</ref>

=== Childcare ===
Huron Towers Preschool/Kindergarten Child Care Centre caters for 44 children.  In 2010 it will move to a new, [[environmentally friendly]] building where it will cater for 47 children.<ref>[http://www.ottawa.ca/residents/childcare/centres/huron_towers_en.html#TopOfPage Huron Towers Preschool]</ref> St. Luke<U+2019>s Child Care Centre also caters for 47 children. This centre operates various [[childcare]] programs and outside visits.<ref>[http://www.ottawa.ca/residents/childcare/centres/st_lukes_en.html St Luke's Child Care Centre.]</ref>

=== Recreational ===
115th Parkwood Hills [[Scouts (The Scout Association)|Scouts]] meets weekly from fall through spring, and holds meetings for Beavers, Cubs and Sea Scouts.<ref>[http://115thphscouts.tripod.com/index.html 115th Parkwood Hills Scouts website.]</ref>

== Churches ==

'''Parkwood Presbyterian Church''' in Chesterton drive<ref>[http://parkwoodchurch.ca/map.html Parkwood Presbyterian Church: map.]</ref> was built in 1974, but its first service was held in Parkwood Hills Public School in 1964.<ref Name=presbyterian/> Due to expansion in attendance, a [[Local church|congregation]] was formed in 1965, and the Mulvagh farmhouse - at the corner of Meadowlands and Chesterton - became the [[manse]], with the congregation's first full-time minister. Between 1965 and 2009 there have only been three resident ministers. Fundraising then provided for the new church building.

Due to further growth of the congregation, an expansion fund was set up in the early 1980s.  The old manse was renovated to become the Fellowship Centre in 1989, with a wheelchair ramp added in 1990.  In 1996 the church building was expanded, and the congregation was involved in various missions in 1996 and 1998.<ref>[http://www.parkwoodchurch.ca/exp96.php Parkwood Presbyterian Church: the 1996 expansion.]</ref><ref Name=presbyterian/>

This is a church-going community which is surrounded by other neighborhoods, so that the only church in Parkwood does not have a monopoly on the local faithful.  For example, those with a different outlook can attend '''Trinity United Church''' in a neighboring hood, which mentions open minds and inclusivity on its website.<ref>[http://www.trinityunitedottawa.ca/ourspirit.htm Trinity United Church: Our spirit - defined as open minds and inclusivity.]</ref>

== Amenities ==
This community includes parks, playgrounds, tennis courts and retail areas.<ref>[http://homes.point2.com/Neighborhood/CA/Ontario/Ottawa/Parkwood-Hills-Real-Estate-Agent.aspx Elaine MacLean: description of the area.]</ref> A neighborhood bonfire takes place at [[Halloween]].<ref>[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAitskQCbc4 Youtube: Parkwood Hills Neighborhood Bonfire, 31 October 2008.]</ref>

=== Parks and sport ===

Parkwood Hills Recreation Centre is in Meadowland Mall, on [[Merivale Road (Ottawa)|Merivale Road]].<ref>[http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=parkwood+hills,+ottawa&sll=54,-2&sspn=104.485,360&ie=UTF8&v=2.2&cv=4.2.0205.5730&hl=en&latlng=45353173,-75730787,7013746244406080315&ei=HtE0Sv2YEdqNjAeH_ZHXAQ&cd=5 Map location of Parkwood Hills Recreation Centre.]</ref>

== Flora and fauna ==

=== Native plants ===
This area is included in [[Ottawa]]'s efforts to reinstate some of the [[native plant|native flora]] and wildlife [[habitat]] which has been displaced due to development.<ref>[http://www.nanps.org/about.aspx North American Native Plant Society website.]</ref> Domestic gardeners are encouraged to plant [[native plant|native species]] such as [[polygonatum|Solomon's seal]] and [[bloodroot]], although many of them are already doing their bit to discourage invasive [[Introduced species|alien species]] such as [[Taraxacum|dandelion]] and [[Daucus carota|Queen Anne's lace]].<ref>[http://greenlivingottawa.com/category/flora-and-fauna/ Green Living Ottawa: Flora and Fauna]</ref>

=== Birds ===
Like many similar [[suburb|suburban]] [[neighbourhood]]s in this zone, Parkwood Hills is rich in gardens, shaded by mature trees and beautified with a wide variety of [[shrub]]s. This has created a [[habitat (ecology)|habitat]] favoured by many [[species]] of birds, particularly those less nervous of living in close proximity with humans. In consequence, backyard [[birdwatching]] can be most rewarding for the [[suburb|suburban]] enthusiast. Birds to be found regularly in the area are [[grackle]]s, [[cardinal (bird)|cardinal]]s, [[hummingbird]]s and [[tit (bird)|chickadee]]s. [http://www.flickr.com/photos/steve-brandon/1341450141/in/set-72157594152216942/ Image]. <ref>[http://www.birding.com/wheretobird/canadahotspots.asp Birdwatching.com: birds in Canada.]</ref><ref>[http://www.camacdonald.com/birding/canada.html Birding in Canada: Birdwatching organisations and other information.]</ref><ref>[http://www.trailcanada.com/wildlife/photos/ Photos of fauna in Canada.]</ref> Recently the [[Townsend's Solitaire]] was found and photographed in Parkwood Hills by F. Ouellette-Streeting.<ref>[http://ca.geocities.com/larry.neily@rogers.com/photos.htm Neily World, Birding Ottawa: F. Ouellette-Streeting]</ref>

=== Wildlife ===
Common animals are [[grey squirrel]]s and [[skunk]]s. There are two ways in which wildlife might be viewed here: as a [[pest control|control]] issue<ref Name=animalcontrol/> and as as a recreational issue with [[conservation]] and education in mind.<ref>[http://www.ofnc.ca/The Ottawa Field-Naturalists' Club website]</ref> Deer can wander onto roads and into suburbs, so there is an annual Speeding Costs You<U+2026>Deerly campaign for safe driving.<ref>[http://www.ottawa.ca/residents/onthemove/driving/road_safety/motorists/collision_prevention_en.html Ottawa: Wildlife / Vehicle Collision Prevention]</ref>
