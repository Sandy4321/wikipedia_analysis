'''Castle Park''' (sometimes referred to as '''Castle Green''') is a public open space in [[Bristol]], [[England]], managed by [[Bristol City Council]]. It is bounded by the [[Floating Harbour]] and Castle Street to the south, Lower Castle Street to the east, and Broad Weir, Newgate and Wine Street to the north. Its western boundary is less obviously defined and has been the subject of controversy, perhaps because the area around High Street and St Mary-le-Port Church, though not part of the park and always intended for development, is often considered at the same time as the park.<ref name="ffbparks">{{cite book |title=The Fight for Bristol |first1=Gordon |last1=Priest |first2=Pamela |last2=Cobb |year=1980 |chapter=Open spaces |publisher=Bristol Civic Society and The Redcliffe Press}}</ref> The park was completed in 1978,<ref name="ffbparks" /> and occupies most of the site which had contained Bristol's main shopping area. Much of this area was heavily damaged by bombing during the [[Second World War]], and that which remained was subsequently demolished.

The ruined tower of [[St Mary le Port Church, Bristol|St Mary-le-Port church]] stands to the west of the park, surrounded by derelict financial office buildings. Adjoining the ruins of [[St Peter, Bristol|St Peter's church]] in the middle of the park is a sensory herb garden, and five silver birch trees as a memorial to the beaches of the D-Day landings. To the east is a grassy arena, and the partially-excavated remains of [[Bristol Castle]] with a preserved vaulted chamber. There is also a bandstand and a children's play area. 

Tree-lined St Peter<U+2019>s Square, to the north of St Peter's church, has been home to various events including German Xmas markets. In recent summers a tethered balloon has been placed near the bandstand, offering ascents to sightseers.

Recent attempts to develop the area between the park's western edge and High Street have proved controversial; Bristol City Council are keen to replace derelict buildings with a mixed-use development to help reconnect the Old City to [[Broadmead]] and raise funds to improve the park; others would rather see the park extended to High Street.

==History==

The town of Bristol was settled at some time in the [[Anglo-Saxon]] period on the northern or [[Mercia]]n side of a crossing point of the [[River Avon (Bristol)|River Avon]], at or near to the present [[Bristol Bridge]]. The town lay entirely between the Avon and the [[River Frome, Bristol|Frome]], which at that time emerged into the Avon just downstream of Bristol Bridge.<ref name="little">{{cite book |title=The Story of Bristol |first=Bryan |last=Little |publisher=Redcliffe Press |year=1991 |page=6 |isbn=1-872971-40-7}}</ref>

Archaeological excavations of the area in 1962-1963 suggest that the original settlement was centred to the east of St Peter<U+2019>s Church, with Mary-le-Port on its western limit. The building of Bristol Castle in the latter part of the 11th century resulted in the focus of the settlement being moved to the west, where it developed into a symmetrical plan centred on the crossroads of High Street, Wine Street, [[Broad Street, Bristol|Broad Street]] and Corn Street.<ref>{{cite book |title=Mary-le-Port Bristol Excavations 1962/3 |first1=Lorna |last1=Watts |first2=Philip |last2=Rahtz |publisher=City of Bristol Museums and Art Gallery |year=1985 |isbn=0-900199-26-1}}</ref> The area around Mary-le-Port Street was thus the most ancient part of the mediaeval city. [[Bristol Castle]] was home to the Norman garrison, and was a massive structure whose keep was comparable to that of the Tower of London. The castle occupied the whole of the eastern end of today<U+2019>s Castle park, from just east of St Peter<U+2019>s Church to Lower Castle Street.<ref name="dottyb">{{cite book |last=Brown |first=Dorothy |title=Bristol and how it grew |page=3 |year=1974 |publisher=Bristol Visual & Environmental Group, with the help of a grant from the South West Arts Association |location=Bristol |isbn=0950464821 }}</ref>

In 1612 [[Robert Aldworth]], Mayor of Bristol, rebuilt [[St Peter's Hospital, Bristol|St Peter<U+2019>s Hospital]] on a site between St Peter<U+2019>s Church and the Floating Harbour. This <U+2018>beautiful house with its elaborate carving<U+2019> became the Bristol Mint in 1695, and was considered to be Bristol<U+2019>s greatest architectural loss of the Second World War.<ref>{{cite book |title=Bristol as it Was 1939-1914 (5th Edition) |first=Reece |last=Winstone |year=1978 |publisher=Reece Winstone Archive and Publishing |page=16 |isbn=0-900814-54-3}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |title=Bristol's Earliest Photographs |first=Reece |last=Winstone |year=1978 |publisher=Reece Winstone Archive and Publishing |page=44 |isbn=0-900814-32-2}}</ref>

By the 16th century the castle was <U+2018>tending to ruin<U+2019>, and following his victory in the [[English Civil War]] [[Oliver Cromwell]] decreed its destruction in 1655, a process which was completed within a fortnight.<ref>{{cite book |title=Chilcott's descriptive history of Bristol |first=John |last=Chilcott |publisher=J Chilcott |year=1826}}</ref> The castle had stood on the main route from Bristol to London, and following its destruction a commercial avenue opened along Castle Street from the mediaeval city towards [[Old Market, Bristol|Old Market]]. The demolition of Lawford<U+2019>s Gate at the eastern end of Old Market Street extended this into West Street, creating an uninterrupted route into the bustling heart of Bristol.<ref name="charappr">{{cite web |url=http://www.bristol.gov.uk/ccm/cms-service/stream/asset/?asset_id=29925285 |title=Conservation area 16 <U+2013> Old Market <U+2013> Character appraisal |publisher=Bristol City Council |date=July 2008 |accessdate=2011-03-03}}</ref>

Wine Street and Castle Street became the main shopping streets, where retailers such as [[Boots]], Jones<U+2019>s (later to become part of the [[Debenhams]] group), the [[The Co-operative brand|Co-op]] and [[Marks & Spencer]] traded. Baker Baker had large stores in Bridge Street, Wine Street and Mary-le-Port Street;<ref>{{cite book |title=Bristol & Co |first=Helen |last=Reid |year=1987 |publisher=Redcliffe Press |isbn=0-948265-61-2}}</ref>  two of these were connected by a high bridge across Mary-le-Port Street.<ref>{{cite book |title=Bristol Blitzed |first=Reece |last=Winstone |year=1973 |publisher=Reece Winstone Archive and Publishing |page=30 |isbn=0-900814-43-8}}</ref> The the area also hosted a cinema (the News Theatre) and its narrow winding back-streets contained many independent shops, hotels, and pubs.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.flickr.com/photos/brizzlebornandbred/tags/streetplan |title=brizzle born and bred's photostream/Tags/streetplan }}</ref> At the corner of High Street and Wine Street stood the 'most loved fragment of Old Bristol': The [[The Dutch House, Bristol|Dutch House]].<ref>{{cite book |title=Bristol Blitzed |first=Reece |last=Winstone |year=1973 |publisher=Reece Winstone Archive and Publishing |page=26 |isbn=0-900814-43-8}}</ref>

===24 November 1940===
{{See also|Bristol Blitz}}
On the afternoon of 24 November 1940, 148 aircraft of the [[History of the Luftwaffe (1933<U+2013>1945)|Luftwaffe]] left airfields in Northern France destined for Bristol. The concentration point was to be the [[Bristol Harbour|City Docks]], and their objective was to destroy Bristol's industry and port facilities. 135 aircraft reached the target area, and dropped {{convert|156,250|kg|lb|abbr=on}} of high explosives,{{convert|4,750|kg|lb|abbr=on}} of oil bombs and 12,500 incendiaries. As the raid progressed, the fires could be seen from {{convert|250|km|mi}} away. Wide areas of the city were struck, but the most concentrated damage occurred in the area between Broad Quay and [[Old Market, Bristol|Old Market]] where fierce fires burnt through the night. By the morning, 200 Bristolians were dead and 689 injured, four Luftwaffe crewmen were dead, one injured and four captured, two aircraft were lost, and a large part of the historic heart of Bristol was a smouldering ruin.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://fishponds.org.uk/luftbri1.html |title=The Luftwaffe over the Bristol area 1940-44, page 1 |work=Fishponds Local History Society}}</ref> 

The destruction was not total, however. Post-war photographs show that buildings survived intact on Bridge Street,<ref name="1940s">{{cite book |title=Bristol in the 1940's |first=Reece |last=Winstone |publisher=Reece Winstone Archive and Publishing |year=1980 |page=51 |isbn=0-900814-61-5}}</ref>

More importantly, the irreplaceable mediaeval street plan remained.

===Replanning===
The idea that Bristol's main shopping area should be moved away from the Castle Street and Wine Street area was first proposed to Bristol Corporation's Planning and Reconstruction Committee by the Multiple Traders' Federation (MTF), representing the larger retailers and chain-stores, in October 1943. They suggested that the pre-war shopping area should be set aside as a civic area with perhaps a concert hall or similar building and an open space, and that the central shopping area should be moved to a less-constrained site. This suggestion formed part of the City Engineer's Master Plan of February 1944, which envisaged that the area would contain a limited number of buildings such as a conference hall, with underground parking for 2,000 cars. The removal of the shopping area was considered desirable because the fire that has destroyed so much of the area was in large part sustained by the congested nature of the area, and in any case many of the chain-stores represented by the MTF wanted larger sites.<ref name="has6">{{cite book |title=Replanning the blitzed city centre |first=Junichi |last=Hasegawa |chapter=6 Replanning the city centre: Bristol 1940-45 |publisher=Open University Press |year=1992 |isbn=0-335-15633-9}}</ref>

The main objection to this plan came from the independent traders who did not wish to relocate because they felt that the proposed new shopping area was <U+2018>off the beaten track<U+2019>.<ref name="has6" /> This objection was not unreasonable, as in its pre-war topography Bristol had a long shopping axis that started at Stapleton Road to the east, passed through [[Old Market, Bristol|Old Market]] into Castle Street, Wine Street, and [[St Nicholas Market|the City Markets]], and then via [[The Centre, Bristol|The Centre]] and [[Park Street, Bristol|Park Street]] to Queens Road and [[Whiteladies Road]]. Moving the central shopping area would break this axis. There was also concern about the serious negative social and economic impacts of <U+2018>sterilising<U+2019> such a large area in the centre of the city.<ref name="has6" /> However when the Bristol Retail Traders Federation, representing the small traders, produced a poll showing that 13,000 people wished to retain the shopping centre on its current site whereas only 400 preferred to see it moved, the local Labour party dismissed the poll describing it as 'undemocratic' and comparing the Federation's methods to those of Hitler.<ref>{{cite book |title=Replanning the blitzed city centre |first=Junichi |last=Hasegawa |chapter=7 City planning in the immediate aftermath of war: 1946 |publisher=Open University Press |year=1992 |isbn=0-335-15633-9}}</ref>

By 1966, the shops had been rebuilt in 'barren' Broadmead (at the expense of demolishing an area of [[Victorian architecture|Victorian]], [[Georgian architecture|Georgian]] and [[Tudor architecture|Tudor]] buildings that had escaped the wartime bombing more or less unscathed),<ref name="ffbsetscene">{{cite book |title=The Fight for Bristol |first1=Gordon |last1=Priest |first2=Pamela |last2=Cobb |year=1980 |chapter=Setting the Scene: Planning in Bristol since 1945 |publisher=Bristol Civic Society and The Redcliffe Press}}</ref> and the Wine Street and Castle Street area was being used for car parking.<ref name="ffbparks" /> The picturesque area around Narrow Wine Street and Castle Mill Street had been demolished to create modern Newgate, and Old Market, already severed from Bristol<U+2019>s shopping axis by the new Temple Way Underpass and the destruction of Castle Street, was in serious decline.<ref name="ffburbren">{{cite book |title=The Fight for Bristol |first1=Gordon |last1=Priest |first2=Pamela |last2=Cobb |year=1980 |chapter=Urban renewal |publisher=Bristol Civic Society and The Redcliffe Press}}</ref> The plan for Castle Park was crystallising, however. The ruined St Peter<U+2019>s Church would be surrounded by a museum and an art gallery; to the east of this there would be an arts centre and the remaining area east to Lower Castle Street would be a park. The south-western corner nearest [[Bristol Bridge]] would contain a riverside hotel, and the north-western corner would be home to 'a block for cultural, professional and exhibition purposes'.<ref name="ffbparks" />

In the event, the north-western corner was leased to the Bank of England and [[Norwich Union|Norwich Union Insurance]] (whose offices now stand derelict), and the critical corner site where the Dutch House had stood was replaced by a link road to a short section of dual-carriageway linking High Street with Wine Street.<ref name="ffbparks" /> Plans for a civic centre were dropped as being too expensive.

Finally, in 1977, work began on an <U+2018>emasculated<U+2019> version of the new park. This was designed by Bristol City Council<U+2019>s parks department and, largely for financial reasons, it contained few of the features intended by earlier plans<ref name="ffbparks" /> but was much larger than that originally planned.  The last remaining vestiges of the mediaeval street plan, Dolphin Street and Peter Street, were buried.

===Mary-le-Port development===
[[File:St_Mary_le_Port_tower_Bristol.jpg |thumb |alt=Tower of ruined St Mary le Port with derelict building in foreground |St Mary-le-Port church, surrounded by dereliction]]

In 2006, Bristol City Council announced its intention to redevelop the area to the west of Castle Park, known as the 'Mary-le-Port' site. These plans encompassed the by then derelict financial buildings, and the area to the west of St Peter<U+2019>s church , about 5% of the park.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/bristol/7758439.stm |title=Inquiry to look at park's future  |work=British Broadcasting Corporation |accessdate=2011-03-01}}</ref> It was to be a {{convert|400,000|sqft|m2}} mixed-use development to 'regenerate this historic heart of Bristol'<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.deeleyfreed.co.uk |title=St Mary-le-Port, Bristol |accessdate=2011-03-01}}</ref> and to 'improve connections between Broadmead, the Old City and Redcliffe' and 'enhance the setting of St Mary-le-Port church'.<ref name="reconsider">{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/bristol/6156628.stm |title=Plans for city park reconsidered |work=British Broadcasting Corporation |accessdate=2011-03-01}}</ref> The council selected Deeley Freed as its preferred developer.
The scheme provoked opposition from park users who felt that any reduction in the area of the park was not acceptable. 'Surprised by the extent of feeling', Bristol City Council decided to revise the plans.<ref name="reconsider" /> Campaigners then applied to have 'Town Green' status applied to the park, but this was declined in 2009.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.thisisbristol.co.uk/news/Battle-Bristol-s-Castle-Park-rages/article-1221958-detail/article.html |title=Battle for Bristol's Castle Park rages on |work=Bristol Evening Post |accessdate=2011-03-01}}</ref>

In 2010, the Mary-le-Port site was listed as being 'for sale' by Bristol City Council.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thisisbristol.co.uk/news/City-plot-sales-net-163-50m/article-2342360-detail/article.html |title=Bristol City Council plot sales could net <U+00A3>50million if it sells four sites in centre |work=Bristol Evening Post |accessdate=2011-03-01}}</ref>
