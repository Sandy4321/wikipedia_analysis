==Early life==
Born in [[Bila Tserkva]] on July 12, 1916, Pavlichenko moved to [[Kiev]] with her family at the age of fourteen. There she joined a shooting club and developed into a [[Marksman|sharpshooter]], while working as a [[grinder (milling)|grinder]] at the [[Kiev Arsenal factory]].<ref name=propbook/> In 1937 as a student of [[Kiev University]] she successfully defended her master-thesis on [[Bohdan Khmelnytsky]].<ref name=WatWar>[http://books.google.nl/books?id=lyZYS_GxglIC&pg=PT557&dq=Liudmila+Pavlichenko&lr=&client=firefox-a#v=onepage&q=Liudmila%20Pavlichenko&f=false Women and War: A Historical Encyclopedia from Antiquity to the Present] by [[Arthur Bernard Cook]], [[ABC-CLIO]], 2006, ISBN 1851097708/ISBN 978-1851097708, page 457</ref>

==World War II==
In June 1941, 24-year old Pavlichenko was in her fourth year of studying history at the Kiev University when [[Nazi Germany]] began its [[Operation Barbarossa|invasion of the Soviet Union]].<ref name=propbook/> Pavlichenko was among the first round of volunteers at the recruiting office, where she requested to join the [[infantry]] and subsequently she was assigned to the [[Red Army]]'s [[25th Rifle Division]];<ref name=propbook/> Pavlichenko had the option to become a nurse but refused; "I joined the army when woman were not yet accepted".<ref name=propbook/> There she became one of 2,000 female [[sniper]]s in the Red Army, of whom about 500 ultimately survived the war. As a sniper, she made her first two kills near Belyayevka,<ref name=WatWar/> using a [[Mosin-Nagant]] [[bolt action]] rifle with a P.E. 4-power scope.

Pvt. Pavlichenko fought for about two and a half months near [[Odessa]], where she recorded 187 kills.<ref name=WatWar/> When the Germans gained control of Odessa, her unit was pulled to be sent to [[Sevastopol]] on the [[Crimean Peninsula]],<ref name=WatWar/> where she fought for more than 8 months.<ref name=propbook/><ref>[http://www.warheroes.ru/hero/hero.asp?Hero_id=26 1<U+041F><U+0430><U+0432><U+043B><U+0438><U+0447><U+0435><U+043D><U+043A><U+043E> <U+041B><U+044E><U+0434><U+043C><U+0438><U+043B><U+0430> <U+041C><U+0438><U+0445><U+0430><U+0439><U+043B><U+043E><U+0432><U+043D><U+0430>], Country's Heroes (warheroes.ru) {{ru icon}}</ref> In May 1942, Lieutenant Pavlichenko was cited by the [[Soviet Southern Army (Great Patriotic War)|Southern Army]] [[Voyensovet|Council]] for killing 257 German soldiers. Her total confirmed kills during World War II was the total of 309,<ref name="FareySpicer2009"/><ref name=propbook/> including 36 enemy snipers.

In June 1942, Pavlichenko was wounded by [[mortar (weapon)|mortar]] fire. Because of her growing status, she was pulled from combat less than a month after recovering from her wound.

Pavlichenko was sent to [[Canada]] and the [[United States]] for a publicity visit and became the first Soviet citizen to be received by a [[U.S. President]] when [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt|Franklin Roosevelt]] welcomed her at the [[White House]].  Later, Pavlichenko was invited by [[Eleanor Roosevelt]] to tour America relating her experiences. While meeting with reporters in [[Washington, D.C.]] she was dumbfounded about the kind of questions put to her.  "One reporter even criticized the length of the skirt of my uniform, saying that in America women wear shorter skirts and besides my uniform made me look fat".<ref name=Time/><ref>[http://books.google.nl/books?id=jTg1xacTjhEC&pg=PT294&dq=Liudmila+Pavlichenko&lr=&client=firefox-a#v=onepage&q=Liudmila%20Pavlichenko&f=false The World War Two Reader] by Gordon Martel, [[Routledge]], 2004, ISBN 0415224039/ISBN 978-0415224031, page 268</ref> Pavlichenko appeared before the [[International Student Assembly]] being held in [[Washington, D.C.]], and later attended [[Congress of Industrial Organizations|CIO]] meetings and made appearances and speeches in [[New York City]]. The United States gave her a Colt automatic pistol, and in Canada, she was presented with a sighted [[Winchester rifle]], the latter of which is now on display at the [[Central Armed Forces Museum]] in [[Moscow]].  While visiting in [[Canada]] along with Vladimir Pehelintsev (fellow sniper) and Nikolai Krasavchenko (Moscow fuel commissioner), they were greeted by  thousands at [[Union Station (Toronto)|Toronto's Union Station]].

Having attained the [[Military rank|rank]] of [[Major]], Pavlichenko never returned to combat but became an instructor and trained Soviet snipers until the war's end.<ref name=propbook/> In 1943, she was awarded the Gold Star of the [[Hero of the Soviet Union]], and was commemorated on a Soviet postage stamp.

==After the war==
[[Image:Pv-modern.jpg|thumb|A later image of Pavlichenko wearing her Hero of the Soviet Union medal.]]
After the war, she finished her education at [[Kiev University]] and began a career as a [[historian]]. From 1945 to 1953, she was a research assistant of the Chief HQ of the [[Soviet Navy]]. She later was active in the Soviet Committee of the Veterans of War.<ref name=propbook>[http://books.google.nl/books?id=Q8XlOJplQRgC&pg=PA31&dq=Pavlichenko+soviet+stamp#v=onepage&q=&f=false Heroines of the Soviet Union 1941-45] by Henry Skaida, Osprey Publishing, 2003, ISBN 1841765988/ISBN 978-1841765983, page 31</ref> Pavlichenko died on October 10, 1974 at age 58, and was buried in the [[Novodevichye Cemetery]] in [[Moscow]].<ref name=propbook/>
