'''SMS ''W<U+00F6>rth''''' ("His Majesty's Ship W<U+00F6>rth"){{efn|name=SMS}} was one of four [[German Empire|German]] [[pre-dreadnought battleship]]s of the {{sclass-|Brandenburg|battleship|4}}, built in the early 1890s. The class also included {{SMS|Brandenburg||2}}, {{SMS|Kurf<U+00FC>rst Friedrich Wilhelm||2}}, and {{SMS|Weissenburg||2}}. The ships were the first ocean-going battleships built by the [[Kaiserliche Marine]] (Imperial Navy). ''W<U+00F6>rth'' was laid down at the [[Friedrich Krupp Germaniawerft|Germaniawerft]] dockyard in [[Kiel]] in May 1890. The ship was launched on 6 August 1892 and commissioned into the fleet on 31 October 1893. ''W<U+00F6>rth'' and her three sisters were the only battleships of their time to carry six heavy guns rather than four.  She was named for the [[Battle of W<U+00F6>rth (1870)|Battle of W<U+00F6>rth]] fought during the [[Franco-Prussian War]] of 1870<U+2013>71.

''W<U+00F6>rth'' served in the German fleet for the first decade of her career, participating in the normal peacetime routine of training cruises and exercises. She took part in the German naval expedition to China in 1900 to suppress the [[Boxer Rebellion]], though by the time the fleet arrived the siege of Peking had already been lifted, and ''W<U+00F6>rth'' saw little direct action in China. She was placed in reserve in 1906 as newer, more powerful vessels had supplanted the ''Brandenburg'' class as front-line battleships. Obsolete by the start of World War I, ''W<U+00F6>rth'' and ''Brandenburg'' served in a limited capacity in the [[Imperial German Navy]] as coastal defense ships for the first two years of the war, though they did not see action. By 1916, ''W<U+00F6>rth'' was reduced to a [[barracks ship]], a role in which she served until the end of hostilities. Despite plans to convert her into a freighter after the war, ''W<U+00F6>rth'' was scrapped in the port of [[Danzig]] in 1919.

== Design ==
{{main|Brandenburg-class battleship}}
[[File:Brandenburg Brassey's.png|thumb|left|<center>As depicted in Brassey's Naval Annual 1902</center>|alt=Line drawing for this type of ship; the vessel had three large gun turrets on the centerline and two thin smoke stacks.]]

''W<U+00F6>rth'' was {{convert|115.7|m|ftin|abbr=on}} long, with a [[beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|19.5|m|ftin|abbr=on}} and a draft of {{convert|7.6|m|ftin|abbr=on}}. She displaced {{convert|10013|t|LT|abbr=on}} as designed, and up to {{convert|10670|t|LT|abbr=on}} at full combat load. The ship was equipped with two sets of 3-cylinder [[Marine steam engine#Triple or multiple expansion|vertical triple expansion steam engines]] that produced {{convert|10000|ihp|0|lk=in}} and a top speed of {{convert|16.9|knots}} on trials; steam was provided by twelve coal-fired, transverse cylindrical [[water-tube boiler]]s. She had a maximum range of {{convert|4300|nmi|link=on}} at a cruising speed of {{convert|10|knots}}. Her crew numbered 38&nbsp;officers and 530&nbsp;enlisted men.{{sfn|Gr<U+00F6>ner|p=13}}

''W<U+00F6>rth'' was armed with a main battery of six 28 cm (11 in) guns of two types. The forward and rear turret guns were 40 [[Caliber (artillery)|calibers]] long, while the amidships guns were only 35 calibers; this was necessary to allow them to train to either side of the ship. Her secondary armament initially consisted of seven 10.5&nbsp;cm (4.1 in) guns, though an additional gun was added during the modernization in 1901. She also carried eight 8.8&nbsp;cm (3.45 in) guns and six {{convert|45|cm|abbr=on|1}} torpedo tubes. The ship was protected with [[compound armor]]. Her main [[belt armor]] was {{convert|400|mm|sp=us|1}} thick in the central section that protected the ammunition magazines and machinery spaces. The deck was {{convert|60|mm|abbr=on|1}} thick. The main battery barbettes were protected with {{convert|300|mm|abbr=on|1}} thick armor.{{sfn|Gr<U+00F6>ner|p=13}}

== Service history ==

===Construction to 1895===
''W<U+00F6>rth'' was ordered as battleship ''B'',{{sfn|Gr<U+00F6>ner|p=13}} and was laid down at [[Germaniawerft]] in [[Kiel]] on 3 March 1890. Initial work on the ship proceeded at the slowest pace of all four vessels in the class; her hull was not launched until 6 August 1892, more than eight months after the other three ships. [[Princess Viktoria of Prussia|Princess Viktoria]], the sister of [[Kaiser Wilhelm II]], christened the ship. Fitting-out work proceeded quickly, and she was commissioned on 31 October 1893, the first ship of the class to enter active duty. Extensive [[sea trial]]s followed her commissioning and lasted until April 1894. During her trials, she was briefly assigned to the maneuver squadron of the ''Heimatflotte'' (Home Fleet) to replace her sister {{SMS|Brandenburg||2}}, which was damaged by a boiler pipe explosion.{{sfn|Hildebrand R<U+00F6>hr & Steinmetz Vol. 8|p=97}}{{sfn|Gardiner Chesneau & Kolesnik|p=247}} On 1 August 1894, ''W<U+00F6>rth'' was assigned as the flagship of the German fleet for the annual autumn maneuvers, under the command of Admiral [[Max von der Goltz]]. Goltz came aboard the new battleship on 19 August with his staff, which included then-''[[Kapit<U+00E4>n zur See]]'' (Captain at Sea) [[Alfred von Tirpitz]]. Toward the end of the maneuvers, which took place in both the [[North Sea|North]] and [[Baltic Sea]]s, Kaiser Wilhelm II came aboard ''W<U+00F6>rth'' and reviewed a fleet parade on 21 September.{{sfn|Hildebrand R<U+00F6>hr & Steinmetz Vol. 8|p=97}}

[[File:SMS Worth - Kiel canal.png|thumb|''W<U+00F6>rth'' in the Kiel Canal before 1901]]

During this period, ''W<U+00F6>rth'' was commanded by [[Prince Henry of Prussia (1862<U+2013>1929)|Prince Heinrich]], the younger brother of Wilhelm II;{{sfn|Hildebrand R<U+00F6>hr & Steinmetz Vol. 5|p=175}} the senior watch officer aboard the ship in 1894 was [[Franz von Hipper]], who went on to command the German battlecruiser squadron during World War I and later the entire [[High Seas Fleet]].{{sfn|Philbin|p=9}} On 1 November, Czar [[Alexander III of Russia|Alexander III]] of Russia died; Wilhelm II initially planned to send his brother to [[St. Petersburg]] to represent Germany at the funeral aboard his flagship. But General [[Bernhard Franz Wilhelm von Werder]] suggested that sending a warship named for the [[Battle of W<U+00F6>rth]] of the still-recent [[Franco-Prussian War]] of 1870<U+2013>71 would antagonize the French delegation and would be unwise, given the recently signed [[Franco-Russian Alliance]]. Wilhelm II agreed, and so Prince Heinrich traveled to the funeral by train.{{sfn|Hildebrand R<U+00F6>hr & Steinmetz Vol. 8|pp=97<U+2013>98}} After her sister {{SMS|Kurf<U+00FC>rst Friedrich Wilhelm||2}} entered service, she replaced ''W<U+00F6>rth'' as the fleet flagship. ''W<U+00F6>rth'' was thereafter assigned to the I Division of the I Squadron, in turn replacing the old [[ironclad warship|ironclad]] {{SMS|Deutschland|1874|2}}.{{sfn|Hildebrand R<U+00F6>hr & Steinmetz Vol. 8|p=97}}

''W<U+00F6>rth'' and the rest of the squadron attended ceremonies for the [[Kaiser Wilhelm Canal]] at Kiel on 3 December 1894.{{sfn|Hildebrand R<U+00F6>hr & Steinmetz Vol. 5|p=175}} The squadron subsequently began a winter training cruise in the Baltic Sea; this was the first such cruise by the German fleet. In previous years, the bulk of the fleet was deactivated for the winter months. The I Division anchored in Stockholm from 7 to 11 December, during the 300th anniversary of the birth of Swedish king [[Gustavus Adolphus]]. Further exercises were conducted in the Baltic before the ships had to put into their home ports for repairs.{{sfn|Hildebrand R<U+00F6>hr & Steinmetz Vol. 5|p=175}} From 19 December to 27 March 1895, ''W<U+00F6>rth'' returned to her old duty as fleet flagship while ''Kurf<U+00FC>rst Friedrich Wilhelm'' was in dock for repairs.{{sfn|Hildebrand R<U+00F6>hr & Steinmetz Vol. 8|p=98}} The ship was occupied with individual and divisional training in early 1895. In May, more fleet maneuvers were carried out in the western Baltic, concluding with a visit by the fleet to [[Kirkwall]] in the [[Orkneys]]. The squadron returned to Kiel in early June, where preparations were underway for the opening of the Kaiser Wilhelm Canal. Tactical exercises were carried out in [[Kiel Bay]] in the presence of foreign delegations to the opening ceremony.{{sfn|Hildebrand R<U+00F6>hr & Steinmetz Vol. 5|pp=175<U+2013>176}}

On 1 July, the German fleet began a major cruise into the Atlantic; on the return voyage in early August, the fleet stopped at the [[Isle of Wight]] for the [[Cowes Regatta]].{{sfn|Hildebrand R<U+00F6>hr & Steinmetz Vol. 5|p=176}} While there on 6 August, Wilhelm II held a remembrance ceremony for the 25th anniversary of ''W<U+00F6>rth''{{'}}s namesake battle. This was sharply criticized in the British press.{{sfn|Hildebrand R<U+00F6>hr & Steinmetz Vol. 8|p=97}} The fleet returned to Wilhelmshaven on 10 August and began preparations for the autumn maneuvers that would begin later that month. The first exercises began in the [[Helgoland Bight]] on 25 August. The fleet then steamed through the [[Skagerrak]] to the Baltic; heavy storms caused significant damage to many of the ships and the [[torpedo boat]] {{SMS|S 41||2}} capsized and sank in the storms<U+2014>only three men were saved. The fleet stayed briefly in Kiel before resuming maneuvers, including live-fire exercises, in the [[Kattegat]] and the [[Great Belt]]. The main maneuvers began on 7 September with a mock attack from Kiel toward the eastern Baltic. Subsequent maneuvers took place off the coast of [[Pomerania]] and in [[Danzig Bay]]. A fleet review for Wilhelm II off [[Jaros<U+0142>awiec, West Pomeranian Voivodeship|Jersh<U+00F6>ft]] concluded the maneuvers on 14 September.{{sfn|Hildebrand R<U+00F6>hr & Steinmetz Vol. 5|pp=176<U+2013>177}}

===1896<U+2013>1900===
The year 1896 followed much the same pattern as the previous year. Individual ship training was conducted though April, followed by squadron training in the North Sea in late April and early May. This included a visit to the Dutch ports of [[Vlissingen]] and [[Nieuwediep]]. Additional maneuvers, which lasted from the end of May to the end of July, took the squadron further north in the North Sea, frequently into Norwegian waters. The ships visited [[Bergen]] from 11 to 18 May. During the maneuvers, Wilhelm II and the Chinese viceroy [[Li Hongzhang]] observed a fleet review off Kiel.{{sfn|Hildebrand R<U+00F6>hr & Steinmetz Vol. 5|p=178}} On 9 August, the training fleet assembled in Wilhelmshaven for the annual autumn fleet training.{{sfn|Hildebrand R<U+00F6>hr & Steinmetz Vol. 5|p=179}} The following month, Czar [[Nicholas II of Russia]] visited the fleet in Kiel, boarding ''W<U+00F6>rth'' on 8 September. The ship won the Kaiser's ''Schie<U+00DF>preis'' (Shooting Prize) for excellent gunnery in the I Squadron during 1896.{{sfn|Hildebrand R<U+00F6>hr & Steinmetz Vol. 8|p=98}}

''W<U+00F6>rth'' and the rest of the fleet operated under the normal routine of individual and unit training in the first half of 1897.{{sfn|Hildebrand R<U+00F6>hr & Steinmetz Vol. 5|p=180}} The ship represented Germany during the [[Fleet Review]] for [[Queen Victoria]]'s Diamond Jubilee in June 1897.{{sfn|''McClure's Magazine''|p=267}} The typical routine was interrupted in early August when Wilhelm II and Augusta went to visit the Russian imperial court at [[Kronstadt]]; both divisions of the I Squadron were sent to accompany the Kaiser. They returned to [[Neufahrwasser]] in [[Danzig]] on 15 August, where the rest of the fleet joined them for the annual autumn maneuvers. The maneuvers were completed by 22 September in Wilhelmshaven. In early December, the I Division conducted maneuvers in the Kattegat and the Skagerrak, though they were cut short due to shortages in officers and men.{{sfn|Hildebrand R<U+00F6>hr & Steinmetz Vol. 5|pp=180<U+2013>181}}

The fleet followed the normal routine of individual and fleet training in 1898 without incident, though a voyage to the British Isles was also included. The fleet stopped in Queenstown, [[Greenock]], and Kirkwall. The fleet assembled in Kiel on 14 August for the annual autumn exercises. The maneuvers included a mock blockade of the coast of [[Mecklenburg]] and a pitched battle with an "Eastern Fleet" in the Danzig Bay. While steaming back to Kiel, a severe storm hit the fleet, causing significant damage to many ships and sinking the torpedo boat {{SMS|S 58||2}}. The fleet then transited the Kaiser Wilhelm Canal and continued maneuvers in the North Sea. Training finished on 17 September in Wilhelmshaven. In December, the I Division conducted artillery and torpedo training in [[Eckernf<U+00F6>rde Bay]], followed by divisional training in the Kattegat and Skagerrak. During these maneuvers, the division visited [[Kungsbacka]], Sweden, from 9 to 13 December. After returning to Kiel, the ships of the I Division went into dock for their winter repairs.{{sfn|Hildebrand R<U+00F6>hr & Steinmetz Vol. 5|pp=181<U+2013>183}}

On 25 November 1899, ''W<U+00F6>rth'' was conducting gunnery training in Eckernf<U+00F6>rde Bay when she struck a rock. It tore a {{convert|22|ft|m|adj=on|abbr=on}} wide hole in the hull, flooding three of her [[watertight compartment]]s. The ship was sent to [[Wilhelmshaven]] for repair work.{{sfn|''Notes''|p=105}} Before repairs could be begun, about {{convert|500|t|LT|abbr=on}} of coal had to be unloaded to lighten the ship. Temporary steel plates were riveted to cover the hole on the starboard side, while the hull plates on the port side had to be re-riveted.{{sfn|''Notes''|p=106}} The work lasted from December 1899 until February 1900; she was therefore unavailable for the normal winter cruise of the I Squadron.{{sfn|Hildebrand R<U+00F6>hr & Steinmetz Vol. 8|p=98}}

=== Boxer Rebellion ===
During the [[Boxer Rebellion]] in 1900, Chinese nationalists laid siege to the foreign embassies in [[Peking]] and murdered Baron [[Clemens von Ketteler]], the German minister.{{sfn|Bodin|pp=5<U+2013>6}}  The widespread violence against Westerners in China led to an alliance between Germany and seven other Great Powers: the United Kingdom, Italy, Russia, Austria-Hungary, the United States, France, and Japan.{{sfn|Bodin|p=1}} Those soldiers who were in China at the time were too few in number to defeat the Boxers;{{sfn|Holborn|p=311}} in Peking there was a force of slightly more than 400 officers and infantry from the armies of the eight European powers.{{sfn|Bodin|p=6}} At the time, the primary German military force in China was the [[German East Asia Squadron|East Asia Squadron]], which consisted of the [[protected cruiser]]s {{SMS|Kaiserin Augusta||2}}, {{SMS|Hansa||2}}, and {{SMS|Hertha||2}}, the small cruisers {{SMS|Irene||2}} and {{SMS|Gefion||2}}, and the gunboats {{SMS|Jaguar||2}} and {{SMS|Iltis||2}}.{{sfn|Harrington|p=29}} There was also a German 500-man detachment in Taku; combined with the other nations' units the force numbered some 2,100 men.{{sfn|Bodin|p=11}} Led by the British Admiral [[Edward Hobart Seymour|Edward Seymour]], these men attempted to reach Peking but were forced to stop in [[Tianjin|Tientsin]] due to heavy resistance.{{sfn|Bodin|pp=11<U+2013>12}} As a result, the Kaiser determined an expeditionary force would be sent to China to reinforce the East Asia Squadron. The expedition would include ''W<U+00F6>rth'' and her three sisters, six [[cruiser]]s, ten freighters, three torpedo boats, and six regiments of marines, under the command of ''[[Generalfeldmarschall]]'' (General Field Marshal) [[Alfred von Waldersee]].{{sfn|Herwig|p=106}}

On 7 July, ''Konteradmiral'' [[Richard von Gei<U+00DF>ler]], the expeditionary force commander, reported that his ships were ready for the operation, and they left two days later. The four battleships and the aviso {{SMS|Hela||2}} transited the Kaiser Wilhelm Canal and stopped in Wilhelmshaven to rendezvous with the rest of the expeditionary force. On 11 July, the force steamed out of the [[Jade Bight]], bound for China. They stopped to coal at [[Gibraltar]] on 17<U+2013>18 July and passed through the [[Suez Canal]] on 26<U+2013>27 July. More coal was taken on at [[Perim]] in the [[Red Sea]], and on 2 August the fleet entered the [[Indian Ocean]]. On 10 August, the ships reached [[Colombo, Ceylon]], and on 14 August they passed through the [[Strait of Malacca]]. They arrived in [[Singapore]] on 18 August and departed five days later, reaching [[Hong Kong]] on 28 August. Two days later, the expeditionary force stopped in the outer [[roadstead]] at [[Wusong]], downriver from [[Shanghai]].{{sfn|Hildebrand R<U+00F6>hr & Steinmetz Vol. 5|pp=186<U+2013>187}} From there, ''W<U+00F6>rth'' was detached to cover the disembarkation of the German expeditionary corps outside the [[Taku Forts]].{{sfn|Hildebrand R<U+00F6>hr & Steinmetz Vol. 5|p=187}}

By the time the German fleet had arrived, the siege of Peking had already been lifted by forces from other members of the Eight-Nation Alliance that had formed to deal with the Boxers.{{sfn|Sondhaus|p=186}} ''W<U+00F6>rth'' left Taku to coal at [[Tsingtau]], the German naval base in China, and on 25 October returned to Wusong via [[Yantai]]. There, she joined the blockade of the [[Yangtze River]].{{sfn|Hildebrand R<U+00F6>hr & Steinmetz Vol. 8|p=98}} Since the situation had calmed, the four battleships were sent to Hong Kong or [[Nagasaki]], Japan, in late 1900 and early 1901 for overhauls;{{sfn|Hildebrand R<U+00F6>hr & Steinmetz Vol. 5|p=187}} ''W<U+00F6>rth'' went to Nagasaki from 30 November to the end of December. She returned to Wusong on 27 December, where she remained until 18 February 1901, when she moved to Tsingtau for division exercises and gunnery drills. ''W<U+00F6>rth'' and the rest of the fleet then stayed in Shanghai in April and May.{{sfn|Hildebrand R<U+00F6>hr & Steinmetz Vol. 8|p=98}}

On 26 May, the German high command recalled the expeditionary force to Germany. The fleet took on supplies in Shanghai and departed Chinese waters on 1 June. The ships stopped in Singapore from 10 to 15 June and took on coal before proceeding to Colombo, where they stayed from 22 to 26 June. Steaming against the [[monsoon]]s forced the fleet to stop in [[Mah<U+00E9>, Seychelles]], to take on more coal. The ships then stopped for a day each to take on coal in [[Colony of Aden|Aden]] and [[Port Said]]. On 1 August they reached [[Cadiz]], and then met with the I Division and steamed back to Germany together. They separated after reaching Helgoland, and on 11 August, after reaching the Jade roadstead, the ships of the expeditionary force were visited by Admiral von Koester, who was now the [[Generalinspekteur der Marine|Inspector General of the Navy]]. The following day the expeditionary fleet was dissolved.{{sfn|Hildebrand R<U+00F6>hr & Steinmetz Vol. 5|pp=188<U+2013>189}} In the end, the operation cost the German government more than 100 million marks.{{sfn|Herwig|p=103}}

=== 1901<U+2013>1914 ===
[[File:North and Baltic Seas, 1911.png|thumb|500px|Map of the North and Baltic Seas in 1911]]

Following her return from China, ''W<U+00F6>rth'' was taken into the drydocks at the [[Kaiserliche Werft Wilhelmshaven|''Kaiserliche Werft'']] (Imperial Dockyard) in Wilhelmshaven for an overhaul that lasted from 14 to 17 August. She then joined the fleet for autumn maneuvers. In the meantime, ''W<U+00F6>rth'' and her sisters, which had been assigned to the I Division before their expedition to China, had been transferred to the II Division of the I Squadron following their return. On 24 November, ''W<U+00F6>rth'' was decommissioned for a major reconstruction at the ''Kaiserliche Werft'' in Wilhelmshaven; she was the first member of her class to be modernized.{{sfn|Hildebrand R<U+00F6>hr & Steinmetz Vol. 8|p=98}} During the modernization, a second conning tower was added in the aft superstructure, along with a [[wikt:gangway|gangway]].{{sfn|Gr<U+00F6>ner|p=14}} ''W<U+00F6>rth'' and the other ships had their boilers replaced with newer models, and also had their superstructure amidships reduced.{{sfn|Hore|p=66}} The work lasted until December 1903.{{sfn|Hildebrand R<U+00F6>hr & Steinmetz Vol. 8|pp=98<U+2013>99}}

After her modernization, ''W<U+00F6>rth'' returned to service on 27 September 1904 assigned to the II Squadron, where she replaced the old [[coastal defense ship]] {{SMS|Beowulf||2}}. She served briefly as the flagship of ''Konteradmiral'' [[Alfred Breusing]] from September until December, when she was replaced in that role by {{SMS|Braunschweig||2}}. On 16 February 1905, ''W<U+00F6>rth'' ran aground in the [[Kieler F<U+00F6>rde]]. She was pulled free two days later after enough coal and ammunition were thrown overboard to lighten the ship. She then steamed into Kiel and entered drydock, where her bottom was found to be slightly dented. A second accident occurred on 5 July, when the torpedo boat {{SMS|S 124||2}} ran across ''W<U+00F6>rth''{{'}}s bow. The battleship could not turn in time and rammed the torpedo boat, damaging it severely. One of ''S 124''{{'}}s boiler rooms flooded and the rush of steam from the boilers badly burned three men.{{sfn|Hildebrand R<U+00F6>hr & Steinmetz Vol. 8|p=99}}

On 4 July 1906, ''W<U+00F6>rth'' was transferred to the Reserve Formation of the North Sea. She initially served as the flagship of the unit, but on 1 October she was replaced by ''Kurf<U+00FC>rst Friedrich Wilhelm''. She was then decommissioned and her crew reduced to only a maintenance staff. Over the next eight years, she was reactivated only twice, from 2 August to 13 September in 1910 and from 31 July to 15 September the following year; both periods were during the annual autumn maneuvers. She served with the III Squadron in both exercises, and was the flagship of the second command admiral for the squadron, ''Konteradmiral'' [[Heinrich Sass]]. She returned to reserve status on 15 September, and a month later was docked in the [[Kaiserliche Werft Kiel|''Kaiserliche Werft'']] in Kiel to maintain her for future service.{{sfn|Hildebrand R<U+00F6>hr & Steinmetz Vol. 8|p=99}}

=== World War I ===

On 5 September 1914, shortly after the outbreak of World War I, ''W<U+00F6>rth'' was assigned to the [[V Battle Squadron]] under the command of ''[[Vizeadmiral]]'' (Vice Admiral) [[Max von Grapow]]. The squadron was initially used for coastal defense in the North Sea. From 19 to 26 September, ''W<U+00F6>rth'' and the rest of the V Squadron went on a sortie into the eastern Baltic but encountered no Russian forces. The ships subsequently returned to the North Sea and resumed their guard duties. ''W<U+00F6>rth'' was briefly transferred to the [[VI Battle Squadron]] from 16 January to 25 February 1915 to strengthen the defenses of the Jade Bight and the mouth of the [[Weser]]. On 5 March, she was moved to Kiel, where her crew was reduced. After a short period of rest, her crew was restored and she and ''Brandenburg'' were transferred to [[Liep<U+0101>ja|Libau]]. She served as the flagship of ''Konteradmiral'' [[Alfred Begas]], the new commander of the V Squadron. In Libau, they were assigned as guard ships in the recently conquered Russian harbor.{{sfn|Hildebrand R<U+00F6>hr & Steinmetz Vol. 8|p=99}}

The two old battleships were initially moored outside the harbor while it was cleared of wrecks. During this period, the ships prepared for an expected attack by the new Russian {{sclass-|Gangut|battleship|1}}s, but the assault did not materialize. On 12 July, the crews of both ships were reduced again. On 15 January 1916, the V Squadron was disbanded and Begas removed his flag from ''W<U+00F6>rth''. She left Libau on 7 March and arrived in Neufahrwasser the following day. On 10 March she was decommissioned in Danzig to free her crew and guns for other uses.{{sfn|Hildebrand R<U+00F6>hr & Steinmetz Vol. 8|p=100}} Some of her main battery guns were converted into [[28 cm K L/40 "Kurf<U+00FC>rst"|"Kurf<U+00FC>rst"]] railroad guns, though they were not ready for service until early 1918.{{sfn|Fran<U+00E7>ois|p=32}} ''W<U+00F6>rth'' herself was employed as a [[barracks ship]] in Danzig until the end of the war in November 1918.{{sfn|Hildebrand R<U+00F6>hr & Steinmetz Vol. 8|p=100}} Both ''W<U+00F6>rth'' and ''Brandenburg'' were struck from the naval register on 13 May 1919 and sold for scrapping.{{sfn|Gardiner & Gray|p=141}} The two ships were purchased by ''Norddeutsche Tiefbaugesellschaft''; ''W<U+00F6>rth'' was initially to be rebuilt into a freighter, but the planned reconstruction did not eventuate. Instead, ''W<U+00F6>rth'' was broken up for scrap in Danzig.{{sfn|Gr<U+00F6>ner|p=14}}{{sfn|Hildebrand R<U+00F6>hr & Steinmetz Vol. 8|p=100}}
