}}The '''Langlois Bridge at Arles''' is the subject of four oil paintings, one watercolor and four drawings by [[Vincent van Gogh]].  The works, made in 1888 when Van Gogh lived in [[Arles]], in [[southern France]],  represent a melding of formal and creative aspects.  Van Gogh leverages a [[perspective (visual)|perspective]] frame that he built and used in [[The Hague]] to create precise lines and angles when portraying perspective.  

Van Gogh was influenced by [[Japanese art|Japanese]] [[woodcut print]]s, as evidenced by his simplified use of color to create a harmonious and unified image.  Contrasting colors, such as blue and yellow, were used to bring a vibrancy to the works.  He painted with an [[impasto]], or thickly applied paint, using color to depict the reflection of light. The subject matter, a drawbridge on a canal, reminded him of his homeland in the [[Netherlands]]. He asked his brother [[Theo van Gogh (art dealer)|Theo]] to frame and send one of the paintings to an art dealer in the Netherlands. The reconstructed [[Langlois Bridge]] is now named ''[[Langlois Bridge|Pont Van-Gogh]]''.

==Background==
===Arles===
Van Gogh was 35 when he made the Langlois Bridge paintings and drawings.  Living in [[Arles]], in [[southern France]], he was at the height of his career, producing some of his best work:<ref name=Morton>Morton, 177-178.</ref> [[sunflowers (series of paintings)|sunflowers]], [[Wheat Fields (Van Gogh series)|fields]], farmhouses and people of the Arles, [[N<U+00EE>mes]] and [[Avignon]] areas.<ref name=Arfin>Arfin, 37.</ref> It was a prolific time for Van Gogh: in less than 15 months<ref>Shoham, 142.</ref> he made about 100 drawings, produced more than 200 paintings and wrote more than 200 letters.<ref name=NGAsun>{{cite journal |title=Effects of the Sun in Provence |journal=National Gallery of Art Picturing France (1830-1900)| page=131 (12 of pdf)|publisher=National Gallery of Art | location=Washington, D.C. | url=http://www.nga.gov/education/classroom/france/picfrance_7.pdf |accessdate=2011-04-28 }}</ref> 

The [[canal]]s, [[drawbridge]]s, [[windmill]]s, [[Thatching|thatched cottages]] and expansive fields of the Arles countryside reminded Van Gogh of his life in the [[Netherlands]]. Arles brought him the solace and bright sun that he sought for himself and conditions to explore painting with more vivid colors, intense color contrasts and varied brushstrokes.  He also returned to the roots of his artistic training from the [[Netherlands]], most notably with the use of a [[reed pen]] for his drawings.<ref>Silverman, 60<U+2014>61.</ref>

===Langlois Bridge===
{{main|Langlois Bridge}}
[[File:Van gogh bruecke 1902.jpg|thumb|180px|The original drawbridge, 1902. It was replaced by a reinforced-concrete bridge in 1930. At Van Gogh's time, it was called ''Pont de Langlois'', Langlois' bridge, after its bridge keeper. Currently the bridge has been relocated and renamed ''Pont Van-Gogh'']]
The Langlois Bridge was one of the crossings over the Arles to [[Port-de-Bouc|Bouc]] canal.<ref>Silverman, 69.</ref> It was built in the first half of the 19th century to expand the network of canals to the [[Mediterranean sea|Mediterranean Sea]].  [[Lock (water transport)|Locks]] and bridges were built, too, to manage water and road traffic. Just outside of Arles, the first bridge was the officially titled "Pont de R<U+00E9>ginel" but better known by the keeper's name as "Pont de Langlois".<ref>Silverman, 59.</ref><ref name=VGM>{{cite web |url=http://www.vangoghmuseum.nl/vgm/index.jsp?page=3761&collection=451&lang=en |title=The Langlois Bridge |year=2005-2011 |work=Permanent Collection |publisher=Van Gogh Museum |accessdate=2011-04-28 |postscript='  See 'Ropes' and 'Something Funny' sections of the page for more information.}}</ref> In 1930, the original drawbridge was replaced by a reinforced concrete structure which, in 1944, was blown up by the retreating Germans who destroyed all the other bridges along the canal except for the one at [[Fos-sur-Mer]], a port on the [[Mediterranean sea|Mediterranean Sea]]. The Fos Brige was dismantled in 1959 with a view to relocating it on the site of the Langlois Bridge but as a result of structural difficulties, it was finally reassembled at Montcalde Lock several kilometers away from the orginal site.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.patrimoine.ville-arles.fr/images/document/canal%20Arles%20Bouc%20Rimeur.pdf |author=Rimeur, L | title=Note sur le canal d'Arles <U+00E0> Bouc {{Fr icon}} | note= extraits du "Bulletin des Amis du Vieil Arles" | pages=43-44 |date=December 1981, March 1982 |  accessdate=2011-05-14}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://projetbabel.org/fluvial/rica_arles-bouc-canal.htm |title=Canal d'Arles <U+00E0> Bouc {{Fr icon}}| work=Projet Babel | accessdate=2011-05-14}}</ref>

According to letters to his brother [[Theo van Gogh (art dealer)|Theo]], Van Gogh began a study of women washing clothes near the Langlois Bridge about mid-March 1888<ref name=L469/> and was working on another painting of the bridge about April 2.<ref name=L473>{{cite web |url=http://www.webexhibits.org/vangogh/letter/18/473.htm |title=Vincent van Gogh. Letter to Theo van Gogh. Written c. 2 April 1888 in Arles. |editor=Harrison, R |year=2011 |work=Van Gogh Letters |publisher=WebExhibits |accessdate=2011-04-28}}</ref>  This was the first of several versions he painted of the Langlois Bridge that crossed the Arles canal.<ref name=VGM/>

Reflecting on Van Gogh's works of the Langlois Bridge Debra Silverman, author of the book "Van Gogh and Gauguin: The Search for Secret Art" comments, "Van Gogh's depictions of the bridge have been considered a quaint exercise in nostalgia mingled with [[Japonism|Japonist]] allusions." Van Gogh approached the making of the paintings and drawings about the bridge in a "serious and sustained manner" with attention to "the structure, function, and component parts of this craft mechanism in the landscape."<ref name=Silverman69>Silverman, 69-74.</ref>

===Perspective frame===
In Arles Van Gogh began using again a [[perspective (visual)|perspective]] frame he had built in [[The Hague]].  The device was used for outdoor sightings to compare the proportion of items that were near to those that were in the distance.  Some of the works of the Langlois Bridge were made with the aid of the frame. Its use "deepened his exploration of the drawbridge as a mechanism."<ref>Silverman, 62, 63, 74, 75</ref>

===Japanese influence===
The Langlois Bridge reminded Van Gogh of [[Hiroshige]]'s print ''[[:File:Hiroshige Van Gogh 2.JPG|Sudden Shower on the Great Bridge]]''.<ref name=Mancoff61>Mancoff, 61.</ref>  Inspired by the [[Japanese art|Japanese]] [[woodcut print|wood block prints]], Van Gogh sought to integrate techniques from Japanese artwork into his own. In a letter to [[<U+00C9>mile Bernard]] about the Langlois Bridge, he wrote: "If the Japanese are not making any progress in their own country, still it cannot be doubted that their art is being continued in France."  With a Japanese aesthetic, Van Gogh's Langlois Bridge paintings reflect a simplified use of color to create a harmonious and unified image.  Outlines were used to suggest movement. He used fewer shades of colors, preferring multiple subtle color variations. The Langlois Bridge reminded Van Gogh of [[Hiroshige]]'s ''Sudden Shower on the Great Bridge'' inspiring him to use blocks of colors, like patterns of yellow against a blue sky, colors chosen to create a sense of vitality<ref name=Mancoff61/> of the Japanese prints and the vibrant quality of light in  southern France.<ref>Silverman, 61.</ref> These approaches created a more powerful impact and depicted the simpler, primitive quality of the country lifestyle.<ref name=Maurer63>Maurer, 63.</ref>

==Three paintings with similar compositions==
''The Langlois Bridge at Arles with Women Washing'' depicts common canal-side activities.  A little yellow cart crosses the bridge while a group of women in smocks and multicoloured caps wash linen on the shore.<ref name=L469>{{cite web |url=http://www.webexhibits.org/vangogh/letter/18/469.htm |title=Letter from Vincent van Gogh to Theo van Gogh, Arles, c. 14 March 1888 |editor=Harrison, R |year=2011 |work=Van Gogh Letters |publisher=WebExhibits |accessdate=2011-04-28}}</ref><ref name=L473/>  Van Gogh skillfully uses his knowledge of [[color theory]] and the "law of simultaneous contrasts"<ref>Fell, 64.</ref> in this work.  The grass is depicted with alternating brush strokes of red-orange and green.  Yellow and blue [[complementary color]]s are used in the bridge, sky and river.  Use of complementary colors intensifies the impact of each color creating a "vibrant and coloristically unified whole."<ref name=Mauer64/>

Naomi Mauer, author of "The Pursuit of Spiritual Wisdom: The Thought and Art of Vincent van Gogh and [[Paul Gauguin]]" describes Van Gogh's technical and artistic execution of this painting. 
<blockquote>"Compositionally, the vertical and horizontal geometry of the bridge and its reflection in the water create a great central cross which imparts a classical symmetry and equilibrium to the canvas.  This central geometric framework, which is echoed and enclosed by the bands of sky above and the bank below, is relieved and enlivened by the great undulating sweep of the hill and shore, the round knot of washerwomen amid the circular ripples of the water, and the flexible, slightly curved grasses at the right.  Both formally and chromatically, the ''Bridge of Langlois'' demonstrates Vincent's abstraction of nature to its essential coloristic and formal elements, and his creation from these components of a harmoniously interwoven unity in which humanity and its works are perfectly integrated."<ref name=Mauer64>Maurer, 64.</ref></blockquote>

For ''The Langlois Bridge at Arles (watercolor)'' Van Gogh manages to create precise details of the bridge, such as the hardware, iron supports, braces and chain pulleys with watercolor.<ref>Silverman, 74.</ref>

==Two other paintings==

===The Langlois Bridge at Arles with Road alongside the Canal===
Van Gogh used varying techniques when he created the painting, depending upon the subject and what he wanted to convey.  The grass and the path in the foreground were painted rapidly.  The bridge, though, was painted in greater detail,<ref name=VGM/><ref>Silverman, 71-75</ref><ref>{{cite web | url =http://www.vangoghmuseum.nl/vgm/popup.jsp?page=3768 |title=Detail, The Langlois Bridge |year=2005-2011 |work=Permanent Collection |publisher=Van Gogh Museum |accessdate=2011-4-28}}</ref> with clearly defined stone piers and wooden beams.  The detail in the ropes used to lift the roadway show that they are attached to the wooden lifting gear.  Van Gogh also plays close attention to the reflection of the bridge in the water.  In the distance is another drawbridge.<ref name=VGM/>

Van Gogh claimed the painting as "something funny... I will not create every day."<ref name=VGM/><ref>Hulsker, 308.</ref> There was something about the setting for this painting that reminded him of his homeland.<ref name=Arfin/><ref>Silverman, 71.</ref>  He asked his brother [[Theo van Gogh (art dealer) | Theo]] to frame an earlier version of the painting in blue and gold (blue in the front, gold on the side) and offer it to an art-dealer in the Netherlands,<ref name=VGM /> named Tersteeg.<ref name=L473 /> Tersteeg knew Van Gogh and his brother Theo when they lived in The Hague.  He nurtured Van Gogh's early artistic interests but their relationship suffered after Van Gogh lived with a prostitute named Sien.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.vangoghmuseum.nl/vgm/index.jsp?page=7822&lang=en |title=Van Gogh and Tersteeg |year=2005<U+2013>11 |work=Permanent Collection |publisher= Van Gogh Museum | accessdate = 2011-04-28}}</ref>

The [[Van Gogh Museum]] claims that the painting there is the last in a series of three,<ref name=VGM/> yet Silverman has identified four oil paintings and a fifth watercolor, as outlined in this article.<ref name= Silverman69 />

===The Langlois Bridge at Arles (F570)===
[[Wallraf-Richartz Museum|Wallraf-Richartz Museum's]] ''Langlois Bridge at Arles'' depicts a woman holding an umbrella as she crosses the [[Langlois Bridge]], following a horse and buggy that just crossed the bridge.  The water in the canal subtly reflects the bridge and the few clouds in the sky.  Van Gogh uses [[impasto]] paint and color to reflect light, much as we would see it in with our eye. Two tall cypress trees and a white house flank the drawbridge which has a moveable center section between stone abutments.<ref>Perkowitz, 121.</ref> The painting is currently at the [[Wallraf-Richartz Museum]] in [[Cologne]], [[Germany]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.vangoghgallery.com/catalog/Painting/281/Langlois-Bridge-at-Arles,-The.html |title=Langlois Bridge at Arles, The |year=2011 |work=Van Gogh Paintings |publisher=Van Gogh Gallery |accessdate=2011-04-28}}</ref>

==Drawings==
Soon after arriving in Arles Van Gogh asked his brother to send him a copy of Armand Cassagne's "Guide to the Alphabet of Drawing."  His request was generated by an interest to return to foundational drawing practices, such as his use of a perspective frame for the drawings and paintings that he made of Langlois Bridge.<ref>Silverman, 61-64.</ref> A letter dated March 18, 1888, to his friend Emile Bernard contains a sketch of the bridge (JH 1370 below) and the color scheme he is considering adopting, clearly showing his use of sketching and drawing as a preliminary to his painting. He spoke of how the town (Arles) "projects the strange silhouette of its drawbridge against a huge yellow sun."<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.lettersofnote.com/2009/11/langlois-bridge.html | title=Langlos Bridge, Letters of Note | accessdate=2011-05-13}}</ref>
