{{Culture of Poland sidebar}}

The '''Polish Baroque''' lasted from the early 17th to the mid-18th century. As with [[Baroque]] style elsewhere in [[Europe]], Poland's Baroque emphasized the richness and triumphant power of contemporary art forms. In contrast to the previous, [[Renaissance]] style which sought to depict the beauty and harmony of nature, Baroque artists strove to create their own vision of the world. The result was manifold, regarded by some critics as grand and dramatic, but sometimes also chaotic and disharmonious and tinged with affectation and religious exaltation, thus reflecting [[Thirty Years' War|the turbulent times]] of the 17th-century Europe.

==Baroque and Sarmatism==

The Polish Baroque was influenced by [[Sarmatism]], the culture of the Polish nobility (''[[szlachta]]'').<ref name=mik_cul>[[Michael J. Miko<U+015B>]], ''Polish Baroque and Enlightenment Literature: An Anthology''. Ed. Michael J. Miko<U+015B>. Columbus, Ohio/Bloomington, Indiana: Slavica Publishers. 1996. 104-108. ISBN 0-89357-266-7 [http://staropolska.pl/ang/baroque/Mikos_baroque/Cultural_b.html Cultural background]</ref> Sarmatism became highly influenced by the Baroque style and produced a unique mix of Eastern and Western styles.<ref name=mik_cul/> "East" refers here to the [[Oriental]] culture of the [[Ottoman Empire]], not the culture of the [[Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] [[Muscovy]]. Those Oriental influences stemmed from a large border shared by Poland with the [[Ottoman Empire]], and it frequent invasions.<ref name=mik_cul/> 

Sarmatist thought had praised the idyllic countryside-existence, and the liberal [[Golden Freedom]] of the nobility, which stood against the [[absolute monarchy|absolute power of the monarchy]].<ref name=mik_cul/> Sarmatism stressed the military prowess going back to the times when szlachta first emerged from the [[knight]] class; and its religious values, both associated with the historical [[Polish messianism|mission of the Polish people]] as a bastion of Christianity. Sarmatian nobles felt superior to even the nobility of the other nations, whom they considered non-free and almost enslaved by their rulers (according to Poland's constitution, the king was but an "equal among equals"). With the progression of time, however, the Sarmatism ideals became corrupted. By the time of the 18th-century [[Enlightenment in Poland]], Sarmatism was often regarded as a backward and ultraconservative relic of the past <U+2013> an opposite of progress, leading the country to its downfall.<ref name="sarmatian review">Andrzej Wasko, [http://www.ruf.rice.edu/~sarmatia/497/wasko.html  Sarmatism or the Enlightenment]: The Dilemma of Polish Culture, ''[[Sarmatian Review]]'' XVII.2.</ref> 

On a more material realm, [[Orient]]al influences were visible in nobles' attire, arms, and decorations.<ref name=mik_cul/> New Polish costume was based on the [[Ottoman Empire]]'s robe, which spread from nobility to city dwellers and even peasants. A Polish nobleman wore long robe-like garment such as [[<U+017C>upan]], [[delia (clothing)|delia]], and [[kontusz]], often lined with expensive cloth; fitted with a sash belt ([[pas kontuszowy]]) and accessorized with [[knee-high boots]] from soft leather.<ref name=mik_cul/> [[Arabian horse]]s were common in [[Polish cavalry]]. During the 17th century shaving one's head in the [[Tatar]] fashion became popular.<ref name=mik_cul/> The symbol of the noble class was the curved blade weapon, the ''[[szabla]]'', a cross between [[saber]] and [[scimitar]].<ref name=mik_cul/> Ottoman daggers, sheaths, carpets, helmets, saddles, [[klim (clothing)|klim]]s, rugs, tapestries and embroideries were also common: what was not acquired from trade came as loot from many military conflicts along the Commonwealth southern border.<ref name=mik_cul/> The [[Manor house|manor]] (''dw<U+00F3>r, dworek'') of the Polish nobleman was decorated with such war trophies.<ref name=mik_cul/> Some luxury items were of domestic produce, often imitating the Orient style;<ref name=mik_cul/> most were imported from the West via Danzig ([[Gda<U+0144>sk]]) or from the East. Displaying one's wealth was important, and excuses where many: from the [[name day]] of the [[patron saint]] to weddings and funerals, they be observed in extravagant fashion.<ref name=mik_cul/> A distinctive art of [[coffin portrait]]s emerged during that period.<ref name=mik_cul/>

==Counter-reformation==
[[File:Alegoria wiosny.jpg|thumb|right|[[Plafond]] ''Allegory of Spring'' by [[Jerzy Siemiginowski-Eleuter]], 1680s]]
The [[Roman Catholic Church]] became one of the major patrons of the arts; another was the royal house, whose patronage was most visible in the new capital of [[Warsaw]].<ref name=mik_cul/> There the pious Catholic king [[Sigismund III Vasa]] sponsored many Baroque sacral constructions. In its first phase, ecclesiastical Baroque architecture was primarily associated with the [[Jesuit Order]], who arrived in Poland in 1564, as part of the [[counter-reformation]], a trend which over the next century would triumph in Poland.<ref name=mik_cul/> The Jesuits established churches and schools in many major cities, slowly winning over the Protestant educational centers in Thorn ([[Toru<U+0144>]]), Danzig and Elbing ([[Elbl<U+0105>g]]), and [[Leszno]] (where the [[Comenius]] school of the [[Bohemian Brothers]] was located).<ref name=mik_cul/> The eventual victory of the counter-reformation in Poland would eventually be one of the reasons that would contribute to its cultural stagnation.<ref>{{en icon}} {{cite book |author=Robert Bideleux, Ian Jeffries|coauthors=|title=A history of eastern Europe: crisis and change|year=1998 |editor= |page=153|pages= |chapter=|chapterurl= |publisher=Routledge |location= |isbn=0-415-16112-6|url=|format= |accessdate=}}</ref>

==Architecture==

Early Polish baroque buildings were often designed by foreign (most often, Italian) architects. The first [[baroque]] structure in the [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]] was the Corpus Christi Church in [[Nie<U+015B>wie<U+017C>]] (now in [[Belarus]]). The first baroque building in present-day [[Poland]] was the Church of St. Peter and Paul in [[Krak<U+00F3>w]] by [[Giovanni Battista Trevano]].  The Jewish population in this period was large and prosperous, and many handsome Polish Jewish [[synagogue]]s were built in baroque style. A handful of these buildings survive, including the [[W<U+0142>odawa Synagogue]]. 

Secular Baroque architecture also grew. The royal [[Royal Castle, Warsaw|Warsaw Castle]] was reconstructed between 1596 and 1619 by the Italian architects [[Giacomo Rotondo]], [[Matteo Castelli]] and [[Jan Trevano]].<ref name=mik_cul/> Outside the Castle, a [[Zygmunt's Column|column with the Statue of King Zygmunt]], sculpted by [[Clemente Molli]] and cast by [[Daniel Tym]] was raised by his son, [[W<U+0142>adys<U+0142>aw IV Waza]], in 1644.<ref name=mik_cul/> [[Park Ujazdowski]] with a new palace, the [[palace of Ujazd<U+00F3>w]], was built by Trevano between 1619 and 1625.<ref name=mik_cul/> Palace of Ujazd<U+00F3>w was soon overshadowed the [[Wilan<U+00F3>w Palace]], raised by King [[John III Sobieski]] between 1677 and 1696.<ref name=mik_cul/> Style of those new royal mansions was soon imitated by numerous [[magnate]]s who did not want to fall behind the times, leading to numerous baroque residences springing throughout Polish countryside, such as the [[Kruszyna]] (1630, built for Voivode [[Kasper Doenhoff]]), [[<U+0141>a<U+0144>cut]] (1629<U+2013>1641, rebuilt for [[Stanis<U+0142>aw Lubomirski (1583<U+2013>1649)|Stanis<U+0142>aw Lubomirski]]),<ref>{{en icon}} {{cite web  |author = |url = http://www.zamek-lancut.pl/en/History|title = Castle's history |work = www.zamek-lancut.pl |publisher = |pages =  |page =  |date = |accessdate = 2010-08-01}}</ref> [[Wi<U+015B>nicz]] (1616<U+2013>1621, also for Stanis<U+0142>aw Lubomirski), [[Ujazd]] ([[Krzy<U+017C>top<U+00F3>r]] built in 1628-1644 for [[Krzysztof Ossoli<U+0144>ski]]).<ref name=mik_cul/>
