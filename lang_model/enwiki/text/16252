In 2010, she joined the judging panel on ITV's ''[[Dancing on Ice]]''. She is also the host of [[The Heart Network|Heart FM]] Saturday afternoon [[drive time]] slot.

Her debut solo album ''[[A Girl Like Me (Emma Bunton album)|A Girl Like Me]]'', released in the United Kingdom on 16 April 2001 by [[Virgin Records]]. The album debuted and peaked at number four on the [[UK Albums Chart]], with 21,500 copies sold in its first week<U+2014>the highest album debut from a solo [[Spice Girls|Spice Girl]]. Although initial success was promising, ''A Girl Like Me'' fell down the chart quickly. However, singles "[[What Took You So Long?]]", "[[Take My Breath Away (Emma Bunton song)|Take My Breath Away]]", and "[[We're Not Gonna Sleep Tonight]]" helped the album stay on the UK Albums Chart for several weeks. On 7 September 2001, ''A Girl Like Me'' was certified gold by the [[British Phonographic Industry]] for sales in excess of 100,000 copies,<ref name="bpi">{{cite web |url=http://www.bpi.co.uk/certifiedawards/Search.aspx |title=BPI Certified Awards |publisher=[[British Phonographic Industry]] |date=7 September 2001 |accessdate=27 December 2010}}</ref> ultimately becoming the 147th best-selling album in the UK for 2001.<ref name="yearend">{{cite web |url=http://www.ukchartsplus.co.uk/ChartsPlusYE2001.pdf |title=UK Year-End Charts 2001 |work=[[The Official Charts Company]] |publisher=[[ChartsPlus]] |accessdate=27 December 2010}}</ref> Lacklustre sales may be partially explained by the fact that the album was not released in Latin America (except in Brazil, Argentina, and Chile) and North America.

==Biography==
===1976<U+2013>92: Early life and career beginnings===
Bunton was born in [[Finchley]], north London, raised a Catholic, and grew up in [[Woodside Park]].<ref>http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4159/is_20031026/ai_n12748928 {{Dead link|date=February 2010}}</ref> Her parents, Pauline, a karate instructor, and Trevor, a milkman, split up when she was 11, after which she stayed with her mother.

===1993<U+2013>00: Spice Girls===
{{main|Spice Girls}}
She joined the [[Spice Girls]] (then called Touch) in 1993 after [[Michelle Stephenson]] left.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}} Bunton was called Baby Spice because she was the youngest, had long [[blonde]] [[pigtails]], wore [[babydoll]] dresses and had a [[girly girl]] personality.{{citation needed|date=December 2010}}

The debut single''[[Wannabe (song)|Wannabe]]'' was the first of nine number ones in the United Kingdom for the Spice Girls, and reached the top in 37 countries.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}} As a songwriter, Bunton set the shortest time to achieve six #1 UK singles, one year and five months from ''Wannabe'' to [[Too Much (Spice Girls song)|Too Much]].{{citation needed|date=December 2010}} In 1999, she presented ''Emma'' on [[VH1]]. She recorded "''(Hey You) Free Up Your Mind''" for the film ''[[Pok<U+00E9>mon: The First Movie]]''.

===2001<U+2013>05: ''A Girl Like Me'' and ''Free Me''===
Her debut solo album ''[[A Girl Like Me (Emma Bunton album)|A Girl Like Me]]'', released in the United Kingdom on 16 April 2001 by [[Virgin Records]]. The album debuted and peaked at number four on the [[UK Albums Chart]], with 21,500 copies sold in its first week<U+2014>the highest album debut from a solo [[Spice Girls|Spice Girl]].

Bunton's second album, ''[[Free Me]]'', was released in 2003 through [[19 Entertainment]]/[[Universal Records]]. Four singles were taken from it: "[[Free Me (song)|Free Me]]", "[[Maybe (Emma Bunton song)|Maybe]]", "[[I'll Be There (Emma Bunton song)|I'll Be There]]" and "[[Crickets Sing For Anamaria]]". After success in the [[Hot Dance Club Play|American dance charts]] the album was sold in North America.{{citation needed|date=December 2010}} The American edition included remixes and a different cover.{{citation needed|date=December 2010}} The album was the second to follow her 2001 release, ''[[A Girl Like Me (Emma Bunton album)|A Girl Like Me]]'', and spent over twelve weeks inside the [[UK Albums Chart]], peaking at number seven and selling over 141,712 copies, earning gold award status. The album was widely acclaimed by critics as being the "one of best solo Spice records ever" due to its catchy and fun use of sounds from the [[Motown Sound|Motown]] and the 1960s era. The album was largely produced by [[Mike Peden]] and [[Yak Bondy]], who have produced tracks for [[S Club 7]] and [[Lucie Silvas]], to name a few. Other contributions on the album courtesy of [[Cathy Dennis]], Henry Binns, and Puerto Rican singer [[Luis Fonsi]]. "One Thing I Know", an unreleased track co-written by Bunton for ''Free Me'', was recorded by another 19 Management act, [[S Club 8]], for their album ''[[Sundown (S Club 8 album)|Sundown]]''. Bunton's original vocals can clearly be heard on S Club 8's version.

The lead single, "[[Free Me (song)|Free Me]]", was released in the spring of 2003. The song immediately picked up [[airplay]], and the single sold well in the UK, peaking at number five on the [[UK Singles Chart]]. "[[Maybe (Emma Bunton song)|Maybe]]" was released as the second single in the autumn of 2003, and also gained extensive airplay throughout the UK, peaking at number six, one position lower than its predecessor.

In the spring of 2004, the album and its third single, "[[I'll Be There (Emma Bunton song)|I'll Be There]]", were released. The single, like its two predecessors, performed well on the charts, peaking at number seven, one position below "Maybe", and two positions below "Free Me". The album sold more copies in its first week then her debut solo record had, and would ultimately go on to outsell it by 25,000 copies. With this, Bunton became the only [[Spice Girls]] member to have sold more copies of her second album than her first in UK. Later in the year, the fourth single, "[[Crickets Sing for Anamaria]]", was released. Despite its harder beat and grittier sound, by now the impact of ''Free Me'' was beginning to wear off, and the song only came in at number fifteen on the UK Singles Chart, totalling 25,000 copies, and becoming Bunton's lowest-selling single.

In the U.S., both "Free Me" and "Maybe" were dance club regulars, reaching number four and number six on the U.S. ''Billboard'' [[Hot Dance Club Play]] respectively. In 2005, Bunton filmed guest roles in two [[Bollywood]] films: ''Pyaar Mein Twist'' and ''[[Chocolate: Deep Dark Secrets]]''.{{citation needed|date=December 2010}}

===2006<U+2013>08: ''Life in Mono'' and Return of the Spice Girls===
[[File:Emma Bunton in San Jose crop.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Bunton performing during the [[Return of the Spice Girls]] tour in 2007]]
In October 2006, Bunton was a contestant in the BBC programme ''[[Strictly Come Dancing]]'', partnered by [[Darren Bennett (dancer)|Darren Bennett]]. She finished third, the last female contestant to be eliminated.{{citation needed|date=December 2010}}

In November 2006, Bunton released the [[charity single]] for the BBC [[Children in Need]] appeal, recording [[Petula Clark]]'s 1960s song "[[Downtown (Petula Clark song)#Emma Bunton version|Downtown]]". It reached number three on the [[UK Singles Chart]] and was followed by her third studio album, ''[[Life in Mono]]'' on 4 December.{{citation needed|date=December 2010}} The album was originally set for a [[November]] release in the [[UK]], however it was later pushed back to the [[December 4]] [[2006]].  ''Life In Mono'', much like her previous album, ''[[Free Me]]'', experimented with elements of [[1960s]] [[pop music]].  For this particular album the musical arrangement was more directed towards the [['60s]] [[France|French]] [[pop music]], with some elements of [[United Kingdom|British]] [['60s]] [[Pop music|pop]] and [[Motown]].  The first single taken from the album was a [[cover version|cover]] of [[Petula Clark]]'s [[1964]] hit single "[[Downtown_(Petula_Clark_song)#Emma_Bunton_version|Downtown]]", released on [[November 13]]. "Downtown" is the 2006 [[BBC]] [[Children in Need]] official [[charity single]] and reached #3 in the [[UK singles chart]]. "[[All I Need to Know (Emma Bunton song)|All I Need to Know]]" was released as second single.

Bunton had been working on her third release since [[winter]] [[2004]]. The album's title track is a cover version of the hit "[[Life in Mono (song)|Life in Mono]]" by [[1990s]] [[trip hop]] band [[Mono (UK band)|Mono]], best known through its usage in the [[1998]] film ''[[Great Expectations (1998 film)|Great Expectations]]''. The track "''Take Me to Another Town''" contains a [[sampling (music)|sample]] from [[Herb Alpert]]'s [[1965]] "''Green Peppers''". Due to Emma<U+2019>s pregnancy all forms of promotion were canceled after a few months.  Rumors of a third single surfaced through sites after Emma stated she was thinking of releasing a third single, however this never came.  The songs ''I Wasn<U+2019>t Looking (When I Found Love)'', ''Perfect Strangers'' and ''Take Me To Another Town'' were rumored.

Although it sold almost 13,000 copies in its first week, the album was Emma's first not to reach the UK Top10. It debuted on the UK Albums Chart at #65 on [[December 10]] [[2006]] falling to #75 in its second week and dropped out of the chart the following week. On the whole, the album sold around 60,000 copies in the [[UK]]. The album entered the [[UK Albums Chart]] at 65, selling 13,000 copies in its first week.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}} The second single from it was "[[All I Need to Know (Emma Bunton song)|All I Need to Know]]", on 12 February 2007, intended for [[Valentine's Day]]. Bunton shot the video around [[Old Street]] in east London, in the week before Christmas 2006.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.entertainmentwise.com/video?id=27391 |title='All I Need To Know' - Emma Bunton |accessdate=2007-02-16 |work=EntertainmentWise.com |date=31 January 2007 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070302031624/http://www.entertainmentwise.com/video?id=27391 |archivedate = March 2, 2007}}</ref> Entering the [[UK Singles Chart]] at 60, "All I Need to Know" became the lowest-charting single of Bunton's solo career.{{citation needed|date=December 2010}}
