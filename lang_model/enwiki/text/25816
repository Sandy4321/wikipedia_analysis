The '''Croton Falls''' [[Metro-North Railroad]] station serves the residents of [[North Salem, New York]] and surrounding communities via the [[Harlem Line]]. It is 47.7 miles (77&nbsp;km) from [[Grand Central Terminal]] and the average travel time to Grand Central is 1 hour, 16 minutes.

This station is located in the Zone 7 Metro-North fare zone on the Harlem Line.

The station, the northernmost on the line in [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]], is not far from the [[Putnam County, New York|Putnam County]] line. Putnam runs a [[Public transport|shuttle]] to the station for commuters closer to its location than those of [[Brewster (Metro-North station)|Brewster]] and [[Southeast (Metro-North station)|Southeast]] stations. While [[Interstate 684]] is further away from the station than at [[Purdy's (Metro-North station)|Purdy's]] and [[Golden's Bridge (Metro-North station)|Golden's Bridge]], the next two stations to the south, it is a short drive away via Hardscrabble Road (Exit 8).

It is somewhat smaller than some of the other stations on the line, located on the hamlet's main street. Only four cars can platform at Croton Falls. Service to Manhattan is provided approximately every 15<U+2013>30 minutes during peak hours and approximately every hour during off-peak hours. Some parking is located at the station with more spaces available a short walk away.

==History==
Rail service in Croton Falls can be traced as far back as 1847 with the establishment of the [[New York and Harlem Railroad]], which became part of the [[New York Central and Hudson River Railroad]] in 1864 and eventually taken over by the [[New York Central Railroad]]. The 1870-built former freight house,<ref>[http://ny.existingstations.com/archive/437.jpg Former Croton Falls NYCRR Freight House (Existing Railroad Stations in Westchester County, New York)]</ref> and 1910-built former passenger depot <ref>[http://ny.existingstations.com/archive/436.jpg  Third Croton Falls NYCRR Passenger Station (Existing Railroad Stations in Westchester County, New York)]</ref> still exist to this day. As with most of the Harlem Line, the merger of New York Central with [[Pennsylvania Railroad]] in 1968 transformed the station into a [[Penn Central Railroad]] station. Penn Central's continuous financial despair throughout the 1970s forced them to turn over their commuter service to the [[Metropolitan Transportation Authority (New York)|Metropolitan Transportation Authority]] which made it part of Metro-North in 1983.
