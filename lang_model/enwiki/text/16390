[[John Woo]] directed the film, which brought him wide-spread recognition in the West.  The film was produced by [[Tsui Hark]]. 

''The Killer'' is considered a classic of the Asian [[heroic bloodshed]] genre of [[action cinema]].{{Fact|date=February 2007}} It is a very popular and well regarded film, not only for its stylised violence, but for its themes of honor, love and friendship, which, coupled with the religious motif of salvation (not uncommon in the heroic bloodshed genre) is used to evoke powerful emotions.  The film also asserts a higher morality that is above the law of man, which makes the cop question his motivations.{{Fact|date=February 2007}} The film is notable for its tense [[Mexican standoff]]s, a trademark of Woo. 

A [[Hollywood]] remake has for many years been in development, but various factors have kept it in [[development hell]].{{Fact|date=February 2007}}

==Synopsis==

''The Killer'' revolves around the character of Ah Jong (Chow Yun-Fat), a professional killer. During a hit in the opening act, Ah Jong accidentally blinds a young nightclub singer (Sally Yeh) with the muzzle flash from his pistol. Driven to help the now near-blinded woman by securing money for a sight-saving [[cornea|corneal transplant]], he agrees to carry out another hit. During his escape he is pursued by Li Ying (Danny Lee), a cop who is investigating his crimes. Ah Jong then finds himself being hunted by his employers who want to get rid of him for being seen "on the job".

After witnessing Ah Jong save a dying girl and learning about Jennie's operation, the cop realizes arresting this hitman would not set things right.  Together they fight the [[Triad]]s through amazing action sequences which ultimately climax in an explosive shootout at an abandoned church.  There, Ah Jong has Li Ying swear to donate the hitman's eyes to Jennie if something were to happen to him.

The ending is [[tragic]], in that Ah Jong dies, his eyes shot out by the Triad boss, Wong Hoi. Jennie is left crawling for him in the dark, her operation unrealized.  The boss flees to police custody, but Li Ying chases after him: Li Ying realizes that the law could never give someone like Ah Jong justice, so he acts under his own sense of right and wrong and shoots the boss in cold blood.

==Alternate versions==
In one scene, Ah Jong and Li Ying are in Jennie's flat, holding each other at gun point; in order not to worry the blind girl, they pretend to be childhood friends and give each other silly [[nicknames]]: Ah Jong becomes 'Shrimphead' and Li Ying 'Runt'. Western releases of the film change the nicknames to "[[Dumbo]]" and "[[Mickey Mouse]]", or alternately, "Numbnuts" and "Butthead" on the Criterion version. The UK DVD release is currently the only English subtitled version to render the nicknames correctly.
There is also an extended DVD version, dubbed in [[Standard Mandarin|Mandarin]] which contains several minutes of extra scenes, most notably during the final shootout.

==Influence==
The plot is similar to the 1954 Hollywood movie ''[[Magnificent Obsession]]'' starring [[Rock Hudson]] and [[Jane Wyman]].{{Fact|date=February 2007}} In that movie, Rock plays a playboy who accidentally blinds a young woman, and through newly found Christian ideals and pity that eventually turns to love for the blinded woman, he befriends the woman and tries to raise money for an eye operation, all the time not revealing his identity. 

''The Killer'' was heavily influenced by French director [[Jean-Pierre Melville]]'s 1967 cult film ''[[Le Samoura<U+00EF>]]''. Some of the plot is borrowed (the female pianist in Melville's film is replaced by a nightclub singer), and [[Chow Yun-Fat]]'s character was obviously inspired by [[Alain Delon]]'s Jeff Costello.{{Fact|date=February 2007}} In what may be an acknowledgement of this, Ah Jong is called 'Jeffrey Chow' in the English subtitled versions of the film.

==Possible Remake==

A Hollywood remake has for many years been in development, but various factors have kept it in [[development hell]].  Director and screenwriter [[Walter Hill (director)|Walter Hill]] wrote a script <ref>[http://www.godamongdirectors.com/scripts/killer.shtml]</ref> at one point, which would have had [[Richard Gere]] as Ah Jong (renamed "Jeff") and [[Denzel Washington]] as Li Ying (renamed "Lee"), with the possibility of changing the police officer to a female, played by [[Michelle Yeoh]].  <ref>[http://maddogmovies.com/almost/past.html]</ref>
