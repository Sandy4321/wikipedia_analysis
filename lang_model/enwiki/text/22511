'''Kellie Loder''' (born 1988) is an [[Independent music|independent]] [[singer-songwriter]] from [[Badger, Newfoundland and Labrador|Badger]], [[Newfoundland and Labrador]], [[Canada]] who plays [[drum]]s, [[guitar]] and [[piano]]. She wrote her first song about a cousin who died in a [[Traffic collision|traffic accident]]. Loder is also a [[Nurse education|trained nurse]], having studied at the [[Grenfell Campus]] of [[Memorial University of Newfoundland]].

Loder released her first album, ''The Way'', in August 2009. Later that year she won a talent-search contest hosted by [[YC Newfoundland]], a Christian youth conference. As part of the award, which was valued at $20,000, Loder was given time with [[music industry]] and production professionals, who helped her with ''Imperfections & Directions''<U+2014>her second album, which was released at the 2010 YC Newfoundland. Loder's nursing studies hampered her ability to showcase this album by touring. She was nominated as Female Artist of the Year at the 2010 [[MusicNL]] awards, and Gospel Artist of the Year in 2011. ''Imperfections & Directions'' was nominated as Contemporary Christian/Gospel Album of the Year at the [[Juno Awards of 2012|2012 Juno Awards]], Canada's top music awards. Loder competed in the [[Juno Cup]] hockey game that year, and was awarded a [[Penalty shot (ice hockey)|penalty shot]] after a [[Fighting in ice hockey|fight]] with former [[List of NHL players|National Hockey League player]] [[Troy Crowder]].

Loder's music career is unusual in that she chose to begin it in [[Contemporary Christian music]] (CCM); most young musicians choose [[music genre]]s such as [[Country music|country]] and [[pop music|pop]], which are more likely to bring commercial success. Loder has asserted that she chose CCM because it gives purpose to her music. As of April 2012, she had not decided whether she would focus on [[medicine]] or music.
