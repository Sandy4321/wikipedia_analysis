The '''National Highway Traffic Safety Administration''' ('''NHTSA''', pronounced "nit-suh") is an agency of the Executive Branch of the  [[United States Government|U.S. Government]], part of the [[United States Department of Transportation|Department of Transportation]]. It describes its mission as <U+201C>Save lives, prevent injuries, reduce vehicle-related crashes.<U+201D><ref>[http://www.nhtsa.dot.gov Home | National Highway Traffic Safety Administration(NHTSA) | U.S. Department of Transportation<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

As part of its activities, NHTSA is charged with writing and enforcing safety, theft-resistance, and [[Fuel economy in automobiles|fuel economy]] standards for [[motor vehicle]]s, the latter under the rubric of the [[Corporate Average Fuel Economy]] (CAFE) system. NHTSA also licenses [[vehicle manufacturer]]s and importers, allows or blocks the import of vehicles and safety-regulated vehicle parts, administers the [[vehicle identification number|VIN]] system, develops the [[anthropomorphic]] [[Crash test dummy|dummies]] used in safety testing, as well as the test protocols themselves, and provides vehicle [[insurance]] cost information. The agency has asserted preemptive regulatory authority over [[Greenhouse gas]] emissions, but this has been disputed by such state regulatory agencies as the [[California Air Resources Board]].

Another of NHTSA<U+2019>s major activities is the creation and maintenance of the data files maintained by the National Center for Statistics and Analysis. In particular, the [[Fatality Analysis Reporting System]], or FARS, has become a resource for [[traffic safety]] research not only in the United States, but throughout the world. Research contributions using FARS by researchers from many countries appear in many non-U.S. technical publications{{Fact|date=March 2008}}, and provide a significant database and knowledge bank on the subject. Even with this database, conclusive analysis of crash causes often remains difficult and controversial, with experts debating the veracity and statistical validity of results.{{Fact|date=March 2008}}

== History ==
In 1965 and 1966, public pressure grew in the U.S. to increase [[car safety|the safety of cars]], culminating with the publishing of ''[[Unsafe at Any Speed]]'', by [[Ralph Nader]], an activist lawyer, and the [[United States National Academy of Sciences|National Academy of Sciences]]' "Accidental Death and Disability<U+2014>The Neglected Disease of Modern Society".  

In 1966, Congress held a series of highly publicized hearings regarding highway safety, passed legislation to make installation of [[seat belts]] mandatory, and enacted Public Law 89-563, Public Law 89-564, and Public Law 89-670 which created the U.S. Department of Transportation on October 15, 1966). This legislation created several predecessor agencies which would eventually become NHTSA, including the National Traffic Safety Agency, the National Highway Safety Agency, and the National Highway Safety Bureau. Once the Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards (FMVSS) came into effect, vehicles not certified by the maker or importer as compliant with US safety standards were no longer legal to import into the United States.

NHTSA was officially established in 1970 by the Highway Safety Act of 1970. In 1972, the Motor Vehicle Information and Cost Savings Act expanded NHTSA's scope to include consumer information programs. Since then, automobiles have become far better in protecting their occupants in vehicle impacts. The number of deaths on American highways hovers around 40,000 annually, a lower death rate per vehicle-mile travelled than in the 1960s. 

NHTSA has conducted numerous high-profile investigations of [[automotive]] [[safety]] issues, including the [[Audi 100|Audi 5000/60 Minutes]] affair, the [[Ford Explorer]] [[rollover]] problem and the [[2009<U+2013>10 Toyota vehicle recalls|Toyota: Sticky accelerator pedal]] problem.  The agency has introduced a proposal to mandate [[Electronic Stability Control]] on all passenger vehicles by the 2012 model year. This technology was first brought to public attention in 1997, with the Swedish [[moose test]].

Consumers today have a far greater amount of auto safety information available, due to the efforts of NHTSA and the [[Insurance Institute for Highway Safety]].

==Versus international consensus==
In 1958, under the auspices of the [[United Nations]], a consortium called the Economic Commission for Europe had been established to commonize vehicle regulations across Europe so as to standardize best practices in vehicle design and equipment and minimize technical barriers to pan-European vehicle trade and traffic. This eventually became the [[World Forum for Harmonization of Vehicle Regulations]], which began to promulgate what would eventually become the UN's '''ECE Regulations''' on vehicle design, construction, and safety performance. Although most of the world's countries accept or require ECE-compliant vehicles<U+2014>either as official signatories to ECE regulations or by national regulations effectively identical to ECE<U+2014>the United States, virtually alone in the world, has declined to join the forum or accept ECE regulations.

== Regulatory comparison==

In the mid 1960s when the framework was established for US vehicle safety regulations, the US auto market was an [[oligopoly]], with just three companies ([[General Motors|GM]], [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]], and [[Chrysler Corporation|Chrysler]]) controlling 85% of the market. At that time, the United States had safer traffic than any country in the world, whether measured by the number of traffic deaths per thousand vehicles, or the number of traffic deaths per 100 million miles.

The Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards are contained in the United States [[Code of Federal Regulations]], Title 49, Part 571. This is commonly referred to as '''49CFR571''', with any particular [[FMVSS]] appended after a period, as for example 49CFR571.301<U+2014>the location of FMVSS 301. Additional Federal vehicle standards are contained elsewhere in the CFR. For instance, 49CFR564 contains the specifications and requirements for the various types of replaceable [[headlamp]] "light source" (bulb). FMVSS 209 was the first standard to become effective on March 1, 1967.

Although a system of uniform [[ECE Regulations|auto safety performance and equipment regulations]] had been in place in Europe since 1958, the United States did not seek to adopt or harmonize with these ECE regulations, which have since been adopted by virtually all industrialized countries outside North America. Compared to the ECE regulations, American regulations are fundamentally different in philosophy, content, emphasis, and enforcement protocol. Vehicles conforming to the internationalized (originally European) ECE regulations are allowed or required throughout the entire rest of the world, but such vehicles are illegal in the United States. 

Despite the evolution of the North American auto market to include most of the world's major automakers, and the ongoing proliferation of U.S. safety regulations, the previously-existing market oligopoly still exerts strong influence: American vehicle equipment and construction regulations are based almost entirely on [[Society of Automotive Engineers|SAE]] standards, which were written almost entirely by U.S. automakers. 

In a 2004 book, by former General Motors safety researcher Leonard Evans, government data (FARS for the U.S.) showed other countries achieving safety performance improvements over time greater than those achieved by the United States:

Research on the trends in use of heavy vehicles indicate that a significant difference between the U.S. and other countries is the relatively high prevalence of pickup trucks and SUVs in the U.S. A 2003 study by the U.S. [[Transportation Research Board]] found that SUVs and pickup trucks are significantly less safe than passenger cars, that imported-brand vehicles tend to be safer than American-brand vehicles, and that the size and weight of a vehicle has a significantly smaller effect on safety than the quality of the vehicle's engineering.<ref>{{cite paper

===Importation and safety standards===
The United States blocks the importation of vehicles built to international [[ECE Regulations]] rather than the U.S. safety regulations. Because of the unavailability in America of certain vehicle models, a [[Grey import vehicles|grey market]] arose in the late 1970s. This provided an alternate, legal method to acquire vehicles only sold overseas. The success of the grey market, however, ate into the business of [[Mercedes-Benz]] of North America Inc., which launched a successful [[United States Congress|congressional]] [[lobbying]] effort to eliminate this alternative for consumers in 1988, despite the lack of any evidence suggesting grey-market vehicles were less safe than those built to comply with U.S. regulations. As a result, it is no longer possible to import foreign vehicles into the United States as a personal import, with few exceptions<U+2014>primarily Canadian cars with safety regulations substantially similar to the United States, and vehicles imported temporarily for display or research purposes.  In practice the gray market involved a few thousand luxury cars annually,before its virtual elimination in 1988.{{Facts|date=July 2009}}

In 1998, NHTSA exempted vehicles older than 25 years from the rules it administers, since these are presumed to be collector vehicles. However, the ban on newer vehicles considered safe in countries with lower vehicle-related death rates has led some to claim that the main effect of NHTSA's regulatory activity is to protect the U.S. market for a modified oligopoly consisting of the three U.S.-based automakers and the American operations of foreign-brand producers. It has been suggested<ref>{{cite paper
  | author = M. E. Wenners, J. M. Frusti, J. S. Ninomiya  
  | title = Global Regulatory Harmonization<U+2014>One American Manufacturer'<U+0455> Perspective  
  | version = Ref # 982266
  | publisher = Society of Automotive Engineers
  | year=  1998 
  | url = http://www.sae.org/technical/papers/982266
  | format = paper}}</ref> that the impetus for NHTSA's seeming preoccupation with market control rather than vehicular safety performance is a result of overt market protections such as [[Import tariff|tariffs]] and local-content laws having become politically unpopular due to the increasing popularity of [[free trade]]. This has driven U.S. industry to adopt less visible forms of [[Non-tariff barriers to trade|trade restrictions]] in the form of technical regulations different but demonstrably not superior to those outside the United States.

An example of the market-control effects of NHTSA's regulatory protocol is found in the agency's 1974 [[Criminalization|banning]] of the [[Citro<U+00EB>n SM#US exports|Citro<U+00EB>n SM]] automobile, which contemporary [[journalists]] noted was one of the safest vehicles available at the time. NHTSA disapproved the SM due to its high-performance, low-glare, steerable [[Headlamp#Directional headlamps|headlamp]]s which were not of the outmoded [[sealed beam]] design mandatory in the U.S., and its [[height adjustable suspension]], which made compliance with the 1973 bumper requirements impossible; ironically the bumper regulation was intended to control the costs resulting from low speed collisions, not enhance occupant safety.

===Unintended consequences===
{{POV-section|date=July 2009}}
Some NHTSA standards led to [[unintended consequences]], especially in the early days of NHTSA. The majority Americans in the 1960s, 1970s, and early 1980s did not wear [[seat belts]], which are estimated to reduce the risk of death in a crash by about 45%. NHTSA attempted to promote belt use by a buzzer-light system that operated continuously if belts were not extended from their stowed positions. When that did not significantly increase use, NHTSA's response was an [[authoritarian]] one: seat belt/ignition interlock devices allowed as an alternative to airbags in all new 1974 vehicles, which prevented the car starting unless all front-seat occupants were belted. The interlock provoked such an uproar that Congress forced NHTSA to repeal the standard. [[Airbags]] were beginning to be discussed as ''replacements'' for seat belts<U+2014>not as supplementary restraints<U+2014>and there were even a small number of vehicles sold by [[General Motors]] with dual front airbags and no front seat belts between 1974 and 1977. The controversial mandate for driver-side airbags in all American-sold vehicles was implemented beginning with the 1994 model year.

There are nominally strict cost-benefit ratio requirements for every safety device or system NHTSA mandates for installation on vehicles. That is, the device or system must save more money than it costs, or must cost no more than a specified amount of money per life saved, or it may not legally be mandated. Such requirements are subject to manipulation of estimated costs and estimated benefits to justify or reject almost any standard: FMVSS #208 effectively mandates the installation of frontal [[Airbag]]s in all new vehicles in the United States, for it is written such that no other technology can meet the stipulated requirements.<ref>49CFR571.208</ref> Even using conservative cost figures and optimistic benefit figures, airbags' cost-benefit ratio is quite extreme, and may fall afoul of the cost-benefit requirements for mandatory safety devices.<ref>[http://www.riskworld.com/NEWS/97q1/nw7aa028.htm John Graham Releases Results of Cost-Benefit Analysis of Air Bag Safety]</ref><ref>[http://www.blackwell-synergy.com/doi/abs/10.1111/0272-4332.00070?cookieSet=1&journalCode=risk Blackwell Synergy - Risk Analysis, Volume 22 Issue 4 Page 803-811, August 2002 (Article Abstract)]</ref> However, when [[High-intensity discharge lamp|HID]] [[headlamp]]s appeared on the market, NHTSA made no move to require automatic beam levelling or lens cleaning equipment, citing lack of cost-effectiveness. Both of these systems are glare-control measures required with these powerful headlamps under [[ECE Regulations]] followed outside North America.

The world's first halogen headlamp bulbs, high-performance designs known as H1 and H3, were introduced in Europe in 1962 and 1964, respectively, and quickly became standard the world over, but they were not permitted in the United States until 1996. However other halogen bulbs were available prior to this time. Likewise, the first two-filament high/low beam halogen headlamp bulb, another high-performance design called H4, was introduced in Europe in 1971 and quickly became the world standard, but was not legalized in the U.S. until 1991. Other lighting-related lags attributed to cost-effectiveness regulations selectively obeyed by NHTSA are evident in American regulations; for example, virtually every country in the world has since at least the early 1970s required rear [[turn signal]]s to emit amber light so they can immediately be discerned from adjacent red brake lamps. U.S. regulations still permit rear turn signals to emit red light, citing the same cost-effectiveness regulations.{{Fact|date=July 2009}}

==Fuel economy ==
===Regulations===
NHTSA also administers the controversial [[Corporate Average Fuel Economy]] ('''CAFE'''), which is intended to incentivize the production of fuel-efficient vehicles by dint of fuel economy requirements measured against the sales-weighted average of each manufacturer's range of vehicles. ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' and others argue this program forces people to buy smaller, lighter, less-safe vehicles.{{Fact|date=July 2009}} CAFE may be a driving factor behind the explosion in demand for [[Sport utility vehicle|SUV]]s, which are considered "light trucks" for CAFE purposes and therefore are not required to meet the stricter standards for vehicles classified as "cars."{{Dubious|date=July 2009}}<!-- Isn't this no longer the case?--> Many governments outside North America regulate fuel economy by heavily taxing motor fuel and/or by including a vehicle's engine size or fuel economy in calculating vehicle registration taxes. It is argued that such regulations are not politically feasible, and that doing so would hurt the struggling U.S. auto industry.<ref>{{cite web

==Aerodynamics brings change to NHTSA==
Automakers faced an inherent conflict between NHTSA's stringent headlight legislation, which froze U.S. headlight technology in 1940, and the [[Corporate Average Fuel Economy]] standard, which effectively mandated that automakers develop ways to improve the ability of the car to cleave the air. As a result, in the early 1980s, automakers lobbied for a modification of the mandate for fixed shape sealed-beam [[headlamp]]s.

NHTSA adopted [[Ford Motor Company|Ford's]] proposal for low-cost aerodynamic headlamps with [[polycarbonate]] lenses and transverse-filament [[light bulb|bulbs]]. 

For the 1984 [[model year]], Ford introduced the [[Lincoln Mark VII]], the first car since 1939 to be sold in the U.S. market with architectural headlamps as part of its aerodynamic design. These composite headlamps, when new to the American market, were commonly but improperly referred to as "Euro" headlamps, since aerodynamic headlamps were already common in [[Europe]]. Though conceptually similar to European headlamps with nonstandardized shape and replaceable-bulb construction, these headlamps conform to the [[Society of Automotive Engineers|SAE]] headlamp design standards contained in U.S. [[Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard 108]], and not to the international [[ECE Regulations|safety standards]] used worldwide outside North America.

Consistent with allowing automobile designers appropriate levels of freedom to do their work, the minimum allowed performance and materials durability requirements of this new headlamp system were actually lower than those of the old [[sealed beam]] system.{{Fact|date=July 2009}}

==NCAP==
[[Image:NCAPLabel.jpg|thumb|right|Consumer information label for a vehicle with at least one NCAP star rating]]

In 1979, NHTSA created the New Car Assessment Program (NCAP) in response to Title II of the Motor Vehicle Information and Cost Savings Act of 1972, to encourage manufacturers to build safer vehicles and consumers to buy them. Since that time, the agency has improved the program by adding rating programs, facilitating access to test results, and revising the format of the information to make it easier for consumers to understand.

  | accessdate = 2008-11-24 |format=PDF}}</ref> NHTSA asserts the program has influenced manufacturers to build vehicles that consistently achieve high ratings.<ref name=NCAP/>

The first standardized, 35&nbsp;mph front crash test was May 21, 1979, and the first results were released October 15 that year.

The agency established a frontal impact test protocol based on [[Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard 208]] (<U+201C>Occupant Crash Protection<U+201D>), except that the frontal 4 NCAP test is conducted at {{convert|56|km/h|mph|0|abbr=on}}, rather than {{convert|48|km/h|mph|0|abbr=on}} as required by FMVSS No. 208.

More recently, in an effort to improve the dissemination of NCAP ratings and as a result of the Safe, Accountable, Flexible, Efficient Transportation Equity Act: A Legacy for Users (SAFETEA<U+2013>LU) the agency has issued a Final Rule requiring manufacturers to place NCAP star ratings on the [[Monroney sticker]] (automobile price sticker). The rule has a September 1, 2007 compliance date.<ref>[http://www.safercar.gov/NewCarAssessmentEnhancements-2007.pdf U.S. NCAP enhancements for 2007]</ref>

The agency has an annual budget of US $815 Million (2007). The agency classifies most of its spending under the ''driver safety'' heading, with a minority spent on ''vehicle safety,'' and a smaller amount on environmental matters of which it is in charge, i.e., vehicular fuel economy.

On April 9, 2009 President Obama nominated Chuck Hurly, Chief Executive Officer of Mothers Against Drunk Driving, to be the next NHTSA Administrator.  In addition to drunk driving, his areas of expertise include air bag, seat belt, teen driving, and child safety. David Strickland is the current Administrator, appointed in 2010.
