Walter also played basketball at Niles West,<ref>{{cite news|title=Memorable season gets more so ; Niles West steps back into race by edging Evanston|newspaper=Chicago Tribune|date=January 25, 2003|url=http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/chicagotribune/access/280362711.html?dids=280362711:280362711&FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT&type=current&date=Jan+25%2C+2003&author=Phil+English+Special+to+the+Tribune&pub=Chicago+Tribune&desc=Memorable+season+gets+more+so+%3B+Niles+West+steps+back+into+race+by+edging+Evanston%3B+NILES+WEST+60%2C+EVANSTON+58&pqatl=google}}</ref> and was recruited by several schools to play college basketball.<ref name=Skokie/>  As a sprinter, he also helped lead the Niles West track team to its first outdoor team title at the 2003 Argo Invitational.<ref>{{cite news|title=Sullivan, Mendenhall lead Wolves to Argo track title |newspaper=Morton Grove Champion|date=April 17, 2003|url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=PGHB&p_multi=MGCB&p_theme=pghb&p_action=search&p_maxdocs=200&p_topdoc=1&p_text_direct-0=110EB52000999468&p_field_direct-0=document_id&p_perpage=10&p_sort=YMD_date:D&s_trackval=GooglePM}}</ref>

As the Mendenhall brothers were recruited by various colleges, their mother, Sibyl Mendenhall, established the rules.  She recalled, "We were getting inundated. Location was a large consideration, so the family could see them play. We narrowed it down to three schools, and then I asked the coaches to take them both. It was important to them to be at the same school. They looked at film and offered both of them [scholarships], per my request."<ref>{{cite news|author=Terry Bannon|title=Two-getherness: How a family of 4 decided to stay as 1, relocating to Champaign this summer because 'this was going to be the year'|newspaper=Chicago Tribune|date=October 17, 2007|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2007-10-17/sports/0710170065_1_family-time-illinois-rashard-mendenhall}}</ref>
