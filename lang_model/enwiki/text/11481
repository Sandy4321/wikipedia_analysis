==Proposed Twin Ridge/Morton Meadows Historic District==
According to the City of Omaha, the neighborhood is currently in application process to be recognized as an [[historic district]] of significance to be listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]].<ref>[http://www.nlc.state.ne.us/epubs/H6000/B009.5570-2004.pdf Nebraska Historic Building Survey: Neighborhoods of Dundee and Twin Ridge/Morton Meadows]. City of Omaha. Retrieved 5/20/07.</ref> In 2004, a survey found that 232 of the 295 total properties surveyed could be classified as contributing to the historic nature of the district.  Much of the neighborhood bounded by Woolworth Avenue on the north, South 48<sup>th</sup> Street on the west, Center Street on the south, and South 42<sup>nd</sup> Street on the east is eligible for the [[National Register of Historic Places]].

The region qualifies for the Register under Criterion C: Architecture, as an example of early twentieth-century residential architecture.  Architecturally, the homes form a cohesive grouping in that they are of similar scale, massing, materials and setback.  Many of the brick houses in the district are examples of the [[Tudor Revival]] style, but the [[Bungalow]] and [[Colonial Revival]] styles are also present.  The district also qualifies under Criterion A: Community Planning and Development, as an example of the [[garden city movement|garden city]] style of community planning.  The curvilinear Morton Avenue and the broad, park-like Twin Ridge Boulevard are two of the district's distinctive garden city features.

The majority of structures in this region were built between 1922, when development of the tract began, and 1945, when development ended.

The Morton Meadows Neighborhood Association is composed of officers and committees. Kathy Callahan as Secretary and Paulina Kozycz as Treasurer are the current officers.  The committees include Beautification, Event Planning, Grant Writing, Community Outreach and Citizen Patrol and have several members each.<ref>http://www.mortonmeadows.com/</ref>
