}}'''Amos Bairoch''' is a Swiss bioinformatician, born 22 November 1957.

Bairoch is currently professor of [[Bioinformatics]] at the Department of Structural Biology and Bioinformatics of the [[University of Geneva]] and group leader at the [[Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics]] (SIB). He has created at the SIB a new group called CALIPHO (Computer Analysis and Laboratory Investigation of Proteins of Human Origin) to combine bioinformatics, curation, and experimental efforts to functionally characterize human proteins <ref>http://www.genomeweb.com/informatics/sibs-bairoch-step-down-swiss-prot-director-launch-new-human-protein-resource</ref>. 

His main work is in the field of protein sequence analysis and more particularly in the development of databases and software tools for this purpose. His most important contribution is the input of human knowledge by careful manual annotation in protein-related data.<ref name="Lima2009">Lima T, Auchincloss AH, Coudert E, Keller G, Michoud K, Rivoire C, Bulliard V, de Castro E, Lachaize C, Baratin D, Phan I, Bougueleret L, Bairoch A. (2009) HAMAP: a database of completely sequenced microbial proteome sets and manually curated microbial protein families in UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot. Nucleic Acids Res. 37: D471-478</ref> His first project, as a Ph.D. student was the development of PC/Gene, an MS-DOS based software package for the analysis of protein and nucleotide sequences. PC/Gene was commercialized, first by a Swiss company (Genofit) then by Intelligenetics in the US which was later bought by Oxford Molecular.

While working on PC/Gene he started to develop an annotated protein sequence database which became [[Swiss-Prot]] and was first released in July 1986.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Bairoch Amos|title=Serendipity in bioinformatics, the tribulations of a Swiss bioinformatician through exciting times! |journal=Bioinformatics |volume=16 |pages=48<U+2013>64 |year=2000 |pmid=10812477|doi=10.1093/bioinformatics/16.1.48 |url=http://bioinformatics.oupjournals.org/cgi/reprint/16/1/48 |issue=1}} &mdash; a historical account by Bairoch.</ref> From 1988 onward it has been a collaborative project with the Data Library group of the [[European Molecular Biology Laboratory|EMBL]] which later evolved into the [[European Bioinformatics Institute]] (EBI).

The [[Swiss-Prot]] database is the primary protein sequence resource in the world and has been a key research instrument for both bioinformaticians and laboratory-based scientists in a very wide range of applications.<ref name="Persson2000">Persson B. (2000) Bioinformatics in protein analysis. EXS. 88:215-231</ref> A measure of its success is the recent development of UniProt, the world<U+2019>s most comprehensive catalogue of information on proteins.<ref name="Wu2006">Wu CH, Apweiler R, Bairoch A, Natale DA, Barker WC, Boeckmann B, Ferro S, Gasteiger E, Huang H, Lopez R, Magrane M, Martin MJ, Mazumder R, O'Donovan C, Redaschi N, Suzek B. (2006) The Universal Protein Resource (UniProt): an expanding universe of protein information. Nucleic Acids Res. 34 :D187-191</ref> UniProt is a central information resource of protein sequences and functions created by joining the information contained in [[Swiss-Prot]], TrEMBL, and the American PIR databases.

In 1988 he started to develop PROSITE, a database of protein families and domains. A little while later he created ENZYME, a nomenclature database on enzymes as well as [http://expasy.org/seqanalref/ SeqAnalRef], a sequence analysis bibliographic reference database,.<ref name="Bairoch1991">Bairoch A. (1991) Bioinformatics in protein analysis. Nucleic Acids Res. 19:Suppl:2241-2245</ref><ref name="Hulo2008">Hulo N, Bairoch A, Bulliard V, Cerutti L, Cuche BA, de Castro E, Lachaize C, Langendijk-Genevaux PS, Sigrist CJ. (2008) The 20 years of PROSITE. Nucleic Acids Res. 36: D245-249</ref>

In collaboration with Ron Appel he initiated, in August 1993, the first molecular biology WWW server, [http://www.expasy.org ExPASy]. What was intended as a prototype grew rapidly into a major site that provides access to the many databases produced partially or completely in Geneva as well as many tools for the analysis of proteins (proteomics).

In 1998, with colleagues in Geneva and Lausanne, he was one of the founders of the Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics (SIB), whose mission is to establish in Switzerland a center of excellence in the field of bioinformatics with an emphasis on research, education, services and the developments of databases and tools.<ref name="Hoogland2008">Hoogland C, Mostaguir K, Appel RD, Lisacek F. (2008) The World-2DPAGE Constellation to promote and publish gel-based proteomics data through the ExPASy server. J Proteomics. 71: 245-248</ref>

In November 1997, together with Ron Appel and Denis Hochstrasser, he founded GeneBio (Geneva Bioinformatics SA), a company involved in biological knowledge. In April 2000, the above persons with Keith Rose and Robin Offord founded GeneProt (Geneva Proteomics), a high throughput proteomics company that ceased operations in 2005.

Since 2009, in the framework of the CALIPHO group, directed by himself and Lydie Lane, he is involved in the development
of [[neXtProt]] a new resource which aim to provide life scientists with a broad spectrum of knowledge on all human proteins.

He is recipient of the 1993 Friedrich Miescher Award from the Swiss Society of Biochemistry, the 1995 Helmut Horten Foundation Incentive Award, the 2004 Pehr Edman award, the 2004 [[European Latsis Prize]] and the 2010 [[Otto Naegeli]]
prize.
