'''Captain John Hutt''' ([[1746]] &ndash; [[30 June]], [[1794]]) was an officer of the British [[Royal Navy]] who served with distinction during the [[American Revolutionary War]] and died in 1794 from severe wounds received during the battle of the [[Glorious First of June]], the first major naval battle of the [[French Revolutionary Wars]]. Hutt's ship, [[HMS Queen (1769)|HMS ''Queen'']] was heavily engaged in the action and in celebration of his career and death, a monument was raised to him and the other dead Royal Navy captains of the battle.

==American Revolutionary War==
John Hutt was born in 1746 but did not begin a naval career until relatively late, becoming a [[lieutenant]] in the [[frigate]] [[HMS Lively (1754)|HMS ''Lively'']] in 1773. The ship was stationed on the North American Station and Hutt moved between ships rapidly during his service there, joining [[HMS Hind|HMS ''Hind'']] and [[HMS Scarborough (1756)|HMS ''Scarborough'']] in short order. During the American Revoltionary War Hutt continued service in the Americas, joining the fleet in the West Indies in the small brig HMS ''St Lucia'' in 1780. In February 1781, [[George Rodney|Admiral Sir George Rodney]] promoted him to command of his own ship, the 14-gun brig HMS ''Antigua'', but Hutt did not have her long. On [[28 May]] [[1781]], during a concerted effort to seize [[St Lucia]] from the British by French admiral [[Fran<U+00E7>ois Joseph Paul, marquis de Grasetilly, comte de Grasse|de Grasse]]'s fleet, a boarding party overwhelmed the brig at [[Dauphin Creek]].<ref name="ODNB"/>

Hutt was taken prisoner by the French and remained in their hands until November 1781 when he was returned to England on [[parole]]. Hutt was exchanged for a French officer shortly afterwards and faced a court martial for the loss of his ship at which he was exhonerated.<ref name="ODNB"/> In the summer of 1782, Hutt commanded the sloop HMS ''Trimmer'' and after the peace, in 1783, took over the 20-gun [[HMS Camille|HMS ''Camille'']]. In ''Camille'', Hutt sailed to [[Jamaica]], returning in 1787. In 1790 during the [[Spanish armament]], Hutt became a [[post captain]] in the frigate [[HMS Lizard (1757)|HMS ''Lizard'']] and operated as a fleet scout. He was stationed off [[Ferrol]] to observe the Spanish fleet and he brought the news to England that the Spanish had returned to [[Cadiz]] without threatening action.<ref name="ODNB"/>

==Glorious First of June==
At the outbreak of the French Revolutionary Wars Hutt gained command of the 98-gun [[second rate]] [[HMS Queen (1769)|HMS ''Queen'']], the result of patronage by [[Alan Gardner, 1st Baron Gardner|Rear-Admiral Alan Gardner]] who had commanded Hutt in the West Indies and now personally requested him for this prestigious command.<ref name="ODNB"/> Hutt joined Gardner in the West Indies and ''Queen'' was involved in the first unsuccessful attempt to capture [[Martinique]] in 1793.<ref name="ODNB"/> A few months later, Gardner's squadron was attached to the Channel Fleet and with that force, under [[Richard Howe, 1st Earl Howe|Admiral Lord Howe]], ''Queen'' participated in the [[Glorious First of June]].

In fact, although ''Queen'' was heavily engaged at the action of [[1 June]], [[1794]], Hutt was in no position to command her. On [[29 May]] [[1794]], as the fleets manouvered into position for the main engagement, the French fleet attempting to draw the British away from the convoy, ''Queen'' exchanged shots with a number of French ships. The engagement was inconclusive but Hutt was grievously wounded by a cannonball which took one of his legs off.<ref name="ODNB"/> During the main engagement four days later, Hutt was below decks in the ships sick bay.

Hutt was landed at [[Spithead]] a few days after the battle, and despite his serious injury, doctors indicated that he was likely to make a full recovery. Unfortunately, a few days later, infection set into the wound and Hutt died on [[30 June]], [[1794]] as a result.<ref name="ODNB">[http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/14295 Hutt, John], ''[[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]]'', [[John Knox Laughton|J. K. Laughton]], Retrieved [[12 December]] [[2007]] </ref> Along with [[John Harvey (Royal Navy officer)|John Harvey]] who had died of wounds on the same day as Hutt, and [[John Montagu]], who had been killed at the height of the action, Hutt's name was inscribed on a large memorial in [[St Paul's Cathedral]] in [[London]] and the [[Houses of Parliament]] gave thanks to those captains who had died in the action.
