'''Sunnyside''' is a [[Middle class|middle-class]] and commercial neighborhood in the Western portion of the [[New York City]] [[Borough (New York City)|borough]] of [[Queens]]. It shares borders with [[Hunters Point, Queens|Hunters Point]] and [[Long Island City]] to the west, [[Astoria, Queens|Astoria]] to the north, [[Woodside, Queens|Woodside]] to the east and [[Maspeth, Queens|Maspeth]] to the south. The neighborhood is part of Queens Community District 2, served by [[Queens Community Board 2]].<ref>[http://www.nyc.gov/html/cau/html/cb/cb_queens.shtml Queens Community Boards], New York City. Accessed September 3, 2007.</ref>

The land was originally owned by French settlers in the 1800s. The name "Sunnyside" is derived from Sunnyside Hill Farms, so named by the Bragraws family who owned the land.<ref name=History>[http://queenslibrary.org/index.aspx?page_nm=CL-Communityinfo&branch_id=SU&#clhistory Community and Library History], [[Queens Borough Public Library]]. Accessed February 14, 2008.</ref> Sunnyside was a rural hamlet mostly consisting of small farms and marshland. It was incorporated into [[Long Island City]] in 1870, and developed into a [[bedroom community]] after the [[Queensboro Bridge]] was completed in 1909. A large portion of the neighborhood is six-story apartment buildings constructed during the 1920s and '30s.

Sunnyside Gardens, listed as a historic district on the [[National Register of Historic Places]],<ref>[http://www.forgotten-ny.com/NEIGHBORHOODS/sunnyside/sunnyside.html "Sunnyside" on Forgotten NY Neighborhoods]</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=A Pioneering Queens Garden Community Flourishes Anew |first=Julia |last=Vitullo-Martin |url=http://www.nysun.com/real-estate/pioneering-queens-garden-community-flourishes-anew/16589/ |newspaper=[[New York Sun]] |date=2005-07-07 |accessdate=2010-01-17}}</ref> is among the first [[planned community|planned communities]] in the U.S. 

Sunnyside Gardens includes one-, two-, and three-family homes, and a few apartment buildings, all made of Hudson brick (it was inexpensive, durable, and available). Each private residence has a small front garden facing the street and a private garden in the rear. The rental units in the two- and three-family houses enjoy private terraces overlooking the gardens. There are two configurations: the courtyard condition and the mews condition; at the edges of the community some homes simply line the street, with a common walkway running the length of the row. Homes in the courtyard blocks enclose an inner courtyard that was designated a common, landscaped but not used for recreation. Each homeowner actually owned, and paid taxes on, the part of the common in the block and lot, even if it was not used. The mews houses face a common front court and back on alleys; each mews house also has a private rear yard. 

This model allowed for denser residential development, while also providing ample open/green-space amenities. [[Clarence Stein]] and [[Henry Wright (landscape architect)|Henry Wright]] served as the primary architects and planners for this development ([[Frederick L. Ackerman]] designed some of the mews houses), and the landscape architect was [[Marjorie Sewell Cautley]]. As an amenity for the residents, the City Housing Corporation reserved lots on the northern edge of the development abutting the railroad yards for a private park. This is one of only two private parks in the city, the other being [[Gramercy Park]]. These well-planned garden homes are now listed as a historic district and are also home to one of only two private parks in New York City, [[Gramercy Park]] being the other.<ref name=History/>

===Early history===
The area was first development in the United States patterned after the ideas of the [[garden city movement]] initiated in England in the first decades of the twentieth century by [[Ebenezer Howard]] and [[Raymond Unwin]], specifically [[Hampstead Garden Suburb]] and [[Letchworth Garden City]]. Covering 77 acres between [[Queens Boulevard]] and the [[Sunnyside Railroad Yards]], Sunnyside Gardens was constructed between 1924 to 1928 by the [[City Housing Corporation]], founded by developer [[Alexander Bing]], and architects [[Clarence Stein]] and [[Henry Wright (landscape architect)|Henry Wright]]. The project grew out of discussions in the early 1920s about housing and planning; [[Lewis Mumford]] was a leading participant. 

In the early years of the Great Depression, nearly 60 percent of the residents lost their homes to foreclosure.<ref>Kroessler, Jeffrey A., Building Queens: the urbanization of New York's largest borough. Ph.D. dissertation, CUNY Graduate School, 1991.</ref> Those difficult years saw organized resistance by residents who forcefully resisted efforts by city marshals to evict families. The character of Sunnyside Gardens was protected by 40-year easements which protected the integrity of the courtyards and common walkways and controlled changes to the exterior of every property, extending to even paint color. Those covenants lapsed in the mid-1960s, and some homeowners rushed to claim their property, erecting fences into the middle of some courtyards. In response, in 1974 the Department of City Planning designated Sunnyside Gardens a special planned community preservation district, together with [[Fresh Meadows]], [[Parkchester]], and the [[Harlem River Houses]]. With that designation came rules protecting the inner courts and landscaping, and prohibiting driveways and curbcuts, rear sheds, and additions.

===Sunnyside Gardens Historic District===
The '''Sunnyside Gardens Historic District''' is a national [[Historic district (United States)|historic district]] that includes 66 contributing buildings and 12 contributing sites.<ref name="nrhpinv_ny">{{cite web|url=http://www.oprhp.state.ny.us/hpimaging/hp_view.asp?GroupView=7403|title=National Register of Historic Places Registration: Sunnyside Gardens Historic District|date=August 1984|accessdate=2011-01-16 |author=Merrill Hesch|publisher=[[New York State Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation]]}} ''See also:'' {{cite web|url=http://www.oprhp.state.ny.us/hpimaging/hp_view.asp?GroupView=7412|title=Accompanying 24 photos}}</ref> It was listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1984.<ref name="nris"/> 

In 2003, a grassroots movement started to request designation as a New York City Historic District, in response to lack of protection for the historic character of the homes in the neighborhood. The campaign was surprisingly contentious and garnered publicity in major news outlets, including WNYC and the New York Times.   On April 17, 2007, the [[Landmarks Preservation Commission]] held a public hearing on the neighborhood; 60 residents and advocates, including Fiona Lowenstein, a descendant of [[Henry Wright (landscape architect)|Henry Wright]] {{citation needed|date=June 2009}} spoke in favor of landmark designation while 25 people spoke against. According to the New York Times, Sunnyside Gardens is a <U+201C>Pocket of Queens Brimming with History and Now Resentment<U+201D>.<ref>{{cite news |title=A Pocket of Queens Brimming With History, and Now Resentment |first=Ellen |last=Barry

(WNYC FM 93.9/AM 820; The Brian Lehrer Show, March 7, 2007)]</ref> On June 26, 2007, the Landmarks Preservation Commission voted to designate the community.

Before designation there was considerable illegal or simply inappropriate work done on houses. Since designation, there has been a noticeable drop in work done without Department of Buildings permits, and many homeowners have restored their properties under the standards set by the Landmarks Commission. One project converting a two-family house into a single-family residence was awarded an award by the New York State chapter of the [[American Institute of Architects|AIA]].<ref>heimarchitect.com</ref> Gradually the district is returning to its original character.
