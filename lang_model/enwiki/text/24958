'''Bird migration''' is the regular seasonal movement, often north and south along a [[flyway]], between breeding and wintering grounds. Many species of [[bird]] migrate. [[Animal migration|Migration]] carries high costs in predation and mortality, including from hunting by humans. Migration is driven primarily by availability of food. It occurs mainly in the Northern Hemisphere, where birds are funnelled on to specific routes by natural barriers such as the [[Mediterranean Sea]] or the [[Caribbean Sea]].

Historically, migration has been recorded as much as 3,000 years ago by [[Ancient Greece|Ancient Greek]] authors including [[Homer]] and [[Aristotle]], and in the [[Book of Job]], for species such as [[stork]]s, [[European Turtle Dove|turtle doves]], and [[swallow]]s. More recently, Johannes Leche began recording dates of arrivals of spring migrants in Finland in 1749, and scientific studies have used techniques including [[bird ringing]] and satellite tracking. Threats to migratory birds have grown with habitat destruction especially of stopover and wintering sites, as well as structures such as power lines and wind farms.

The [[arctic tern]] holds the long-distance migration record for birds, travelling between Arctic breeding grounds and the Antarctic each year. Some species of tubenoses ([[Procellariiformes]]) such as [[albatross]]es circle the earth, flying over the southern oceans, while others such as [[Manx shearwaters]] migrate {{convert|14,000|km|mi|abbr=on}} between their northern breeding grounds and the southern ocean. Shorter migrations are common, including altitudinal migrations on mountains such as the Andes and Himalayas.

The timing of migration is controlled primarily by changes in day length. Migrating birds navigate using celestial cues from the sun and stars, the earth's magnetic field, and probably also mental maps. Migration has developed independently in different groups of birds and does not appear to require genetic change; some birds have acquired migratory behaviour since the last ice age.

==Historical views==
Records of bird migration were made as much as 3,000 years ago by the [[Ancient Greece|Ancient Greek]] writers [[Hesiod]], [[Homer]], [[Herodotus]] and [[Aristotle]]. The Bible also notes migrations, as in the [[Book of Job]] ({{bibleverse-nb||Job|39:26|KJV}}), where the inquiry is made: "Is it by your insight that the hawk hovers, spreads its wings southward?" The author of [[Book of Jeremiah|Jeremiah]] ({{bibleverse-nb||Jeremiah|8:7|KJV}}) wrote: "Even the [[stork]] in the heavens knows its seasons, and the [[European turtle dove|turtle dove]], the [[swift]] and the [[Crane (bird)|crane]] keep the time of their arrival."

Aristotle noted that cranes traveled from the steppes of [[Scythia]] to marshes at the headwaters of the [[Nile]]. [[Pliny the Elder]], in his ''[[Natural History (Pliny)|Historia Naturalis]]'', repeats Aristotle's observations.<ref name=Lincoln>{{cite book | author=Lincoln, F.

===Swallow migration versus hibernation=== <!-- used as link anchor for [[barn swallow]], please don't change it-->
[[File:Akrotiri spring.jpg|thumb|[[Minoan art|Minoan]] [[fresco]] of [[swallow]]s in springtime at [[Akrotiri]], c. 1500 BC]]

Aristotle however suggested that swallows and other birds hibernated.  This belief persisted as late as 1878, when [[Elliott Coues]] listed the titles of no less than 182 papers dealing with the hibernation of swallows. Even the "highly observant"<ref>{{cite book | title=Birds Britannica | publisher=Chatto & Windus | author=Cocker, Mark; Mabey, Richard | year=2005 | page=315 | isbn=0-7011-6907-9}}</ref> [[Gilbert White]], in his posthumously published 1789 ''[[The Natural History of Selborne]]'', quoted a man's story about swallows being found in a chalk cliff collapse  "while he was a schoolboy at Brighthelmstone", though the man denied being an eyewitness.<ref name=GilbertWhite1/> However, he also writes that "as to swallows being found in a torpid state during the winter in the Isle of Wight or any part of this country, I never heard any such account worth attending to",<ref name=GilbertWhite1>White, 1898. pp. 27<U+2013>28</ref> and that if early swallows "happen to find frost and snow they immediately withdraw for a time<U+2014>a circumstance this much more in favour of hiding than migration", since he doubts they would "return for a week or two to warmer latitudes".<ref>White, 1898. pp. 161<U+2013>162</ref>

It was not until the end of the eighteenth century that migration as an explanation for the winter disappearance of birds from northern climes was accepted.<ref name=Lincoln/> [[Thomas Bewick]]'s ''[[A History of British Birds]]'' (Volume 1, 1797) mentions a report from "a very intelligent master of a vessel" who, "between the islands of Minorca and Majorca, saw great numbers of Swallows flying northward",<ref>Bewick, 1797. p. xvii</ref> and states the situation in Britain as follows:

{{quote|Swallows frequently roost at night, after they begin to congregate, by the sides of rivers and pools, from which circumstance it has been erroneously supposed that they retire into the water.|Bewick<ref>Bewick, 1797. p. 300</ref>}}

Bewick then describes an experiment which succeeded in keeping swallows alive in Britain for several years, where they remained warm and dry through the winters. He concludes:

{{quote|These experiments have since been amply confirmed by&nbsp;... M. [[Johann Natterer|Natterer]], of Vienna&nbsp;... and the result clearly proves, what is in fact now admitted on all hands, that Swallows do not in any material instance differ from other birds in their nature and propensities [for life in the air]; but that they leave us when this country can no longer furnish them with a supply of their proper and natural food&nbsp;... |Bewick<ref>Bewick, 1797. pp. 302<U+2013>303</ref>}}

== General patterns ==
[[File:101111 Maison 007.jpg|thumb|upright|Flocks of birds assembling before migration southwards (probably [[common starling]])]]

Migration is the regular seasonal movement, often north and south, undertaken by many species of [[bird]]s. Bird movements include those made in response to changes in food availability, habitat, or weather.  Sometimes, journeys are not termed "true migration" because they are irregular (nomadism, invasions, irruptions) or in only one direction (dispersal, movement of young away from natal area).  Migration is marked by its annual seasonality.<ref>{{cite book | title=Bird Migration: A General Survey | author=Peter Berthold, Hans-G<U+00FC>nther Bauer, Valerie Westhead | year=2001 | isbn=0-19-850787-9 | publisher=Oxford University Press | location=Oxford}}</ref> Non-migratory birds are said to be resident or sedentary. Approximately 1800 of the world's 10,000 bird species are long-distance migrants.<ref name=Seker>{{cite journal | title=Conservation ecology: area trumps mobility in fragment bird extinctions | author=Sekercioglu, C.H. | journal=Current Biology | year=2007 | volume=17 | issue=8 | pages=283<U+2013>286 | doi = 10.1016/j.cub.2007.04.045}}</ref><ref name=Rolland>{{cite journal | title=Settling down of seasonal migrants promotes bird diversification | author=Rolland, J., Jiguet, F., J<U+00F8>nsson, K.A., Condamine, F.L. & Morlon, H. | journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society B | year=2014 | volume=281 | issue=1784 | pages=20140473 | doi=10.1098/rspb.2014.0473}}</ref>

Many bird populations migrate long distances along a [[flyway]]. The most common pattern involves flying north in the spring to breed in the temperate or [[Arctic]] summer and returning in the autumn to wintering grounds in warmer regions to the south.  Of course, in the Southern Hemisphere the directions are reversed, but there is less land area in the far South to support long-distance migration.<ref name="newton" />

The primary motivation for migration appears to be food; for example, some hummingbirds choose not to migrate if fed through the winter.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.hummingbirds.net/migration.html | title=Migration Basics | publisher=Hummingbirds.net | accessdate=10 April 2014}}</ref>  Also, the longer days of the northern summer provide extended time for [[breeding in the wild|breeding]] birds to feed their young. This helps [[Diurnality|diurnal]] birds to produce larger [[Clutch (eggs)|clutches]] than related non-migratory species that remain in the tropics. As the days shorten in autumn, the birds return to warmer regions where the available food supply varies little with the season.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.researchgate.net/publication/237048440_ENVIRONMENTAL_IMPACT_ASSESSMENT_OF_THE_NATIONAL_LARGE_SOLAR_TELESCOPE_PROJECT_AND_ITS_ECOLOGICAL_IMPACT_IN_MERAK_AREA | title=Environmental Impact Assessment of the National Large Solar Telescope Project and its Ecological Impact in Merak Area | date=February 2011 | accessdate=10 April 2014 | author=Ramachandra, T.V. et al. | pages=71}}</ref>

These advantages offset the high stress, physical exertion costs, and other risks of the migration. Predation can be heightened during migration: [[Eleonora's falcon]] ''Falco eleonorae'', which breeds on [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] islands, has a very late breeding season, coordinated with the autumn passage of southbound [[passerine]] migrants, which it feeds to its young. A similar strategy is adopted by the [[greater noctule bat]], which preys on nocturnal passerine migrants.<ref>{{cite journal | author=Dondini, G., Vergari, S. | year=2000 | title=Carnivory in the greater noctule bat (''Nyctalus lasiopterus'') in Italy | journal=Journal of Zoology | volume=251 | pages=233<U+2013>236 | doi=10.1111/j.1469-7998.2000.tb00606.x | issue=2}}</ref><ref name=bats>{{cite journal|author=Popa-Lisseanu, A.

Within a species not all populations may be migratory; this is known as "partial migration".  Partial migration is very common in the southern continents; in Australia, 44% of non-passerine birds and 32% of passerine species are partially migratory.<ref>{{cite journal | author=Chan K | year=2001 | title=Partial migration in Australian landbirds: a review | journal=Emu | volume=101 | issue=4 | pages=281<U+2013>292 | doi=10.1071/MU00034}}</ref> In some species, the population at higher latitudes tends to be migratory and will often winter at lower latitude.  The migrating birds bypass the latitudes where other populations may be sedentary, where suitable wintering habitats may already be occupied. This is an example of ''leap-frog migration''.<ref>{{cite journal | author=Boland, J. M. | year=1990 | title=Leapfrog migration in North American shorebirds: intra- and interspecific examples|journal=The Condor | volume=92 | pages=284<U+2013>290 | url=http://sora.unm.edu/sites/default/files/journals/condor/v092n02/p0284-p0290.pdf | format=PDF | doi=10.2307/1368226 | issue=2 | jstor=1368226}}</ref>  Many fully migratory species show leap-frog migration (birds that nest at higher latitudes spend the winter at lower latitudes), and many show the alternative, chain migration, where populations 'slide' more evenly North and South without reversing order.<ref>{{cite book | title=Bird Migration: A General Survey | publisher=Oxford University Press | author=Berthold, Peter | year=2001 | page=67}}</ref>

Within a population, it is common for different ages and/or sexes to have different patterns of timing and distance. Female [[Common chaffinch|chaffinches]] ''Fringilla coelebs'' in Eastern Fennoscandia migrate earlier in the autumn than males do.<ref>{{cite journal | url=http://www.zin.ru/journals/AEB/pdf/Panov_2011_19_AEB.pdf | title=Overlap between moult and autumn migration in passerines in northern taiga zone of Eastern Fennoscandia | author=Panov, Ilya N. | journal=Avian Ecology and Behaviour | year=2011 | volume=19 | pages=33<U+2013>64}}</ref>

Most migrations begin with the birds starting off in a broad front. Often, this front narrows into one or more preferred routes termed [[flyway]]s. These routes typically follow mountain ranges or coastlines, sometimes rivers, and may take advantage of updrafts and other wind patterns or avoid geographical barriers such as large stretches of open water. The specific routes may be genetically programmed or learned to varying degrees. The routes taken on forward and return migration are often different.<ref name=newton>{{cite book | author=Newton, I. | year=2008 | title=The Migration Ecology of Birds. | publisher= Elsevier | isbn=978-0-12-517367-4}}</ref>  A common pattern in North America is clockwise migration, where birds flying North tend to be further West, and flying South tend to shift Eastwards.

Many, if not most, birds migrate in flocks.  For larger birds, flying in flocks reduces the energy cost. Geese in a V-formation may conserve 12<U+2013>20% of the energy they would need to fly alone.<ref>{{cite journal | author=Hummel D., Beukenberg M. | year=1989 | title=Aerodynamische Interferenzeffekte beim Formationsfl ug von Vogeln | journal=J.

[[File:Northern Pintail.jpg|right|thumb|[[Northern pintail]] skeletons have been found high in the Himalayas]]
Birds fly at varying altitudes during migration.  An expedition to [[Mount Everest|Mt.

Bird migration is not limited to birds that can fly.  Most species of [[penguin]] (Spheniscidae) migrate by swimming.  These routes can cover over 1000&nbsp;km. Blue Grouse ''Dendragapus obscurus'' perform altitudinal migration mostly by walking. [[Emus]] ''Dromaius novaehollandiae'' in [[Australia]] have been observed to undertake long-distance movements on foot during droughts.<ref name=newton/>

==Long-distance migration==
The typical image of migration is of northern landbirds, such as [[swallow]]s (Hirundinidae) and birds of prey, making long flights to the tropics. However, many Holarctic [[wildfowl]] and [[Fringillidae|finch]] (Fringillidae) species winter in the [[North Temperate Zone]], in regions with milder winters than their summer breeding grounds. For example, the [[pink-footed goose]] ''Anser brachyrhynchus'' migrates from [[Iceland]] to [[Great Britain|Britain]] and neighbouring countries, whilst the [[dark-eyed junco]] ''Junco hyemalis'' migrates from [[subarctic climate|subarctic]] and [[tundra climate|arctic climates]] to the contiguous United States<ref>[http://www.allaboutbirds.org/guide/Dark-eyed_Junco/id Dark-Eyed Junco]</ref> and the American Goldfinch <!--''Spinus tristis''--> from taiga to wintering grounds extending from the [[Southern United States|American South]] northwestward to [[Western Oregon]].<ref>[http://www.allaboutbirds.org/guide/American_Goldfinch/id American Goldfinch]</ref> Migratory routes and wintering grounds are traditional and learned by young during their first migration with their parents.  Some ducks, such as the [[garganey]] ''Anas querquedula'', move completely or partially into the tropics. The [[European pied flycatcher]] ''Ficedula hypoleuca'' also follows this migratory trend, breeding in Asia and Europe and wintering in Africa.

The same considerations about barriers and detours that apply to long-distance land-bird migration apply to water birds, but in reverse: a large area of land without bodies of water that offer feeding sites may also be a barrier to a bird that feeds in coastal waters.  Detours avoiding such barriers are observed: for example, [[Brent Goose|brent geese]] ''Branta bernicla'' migrating from the [[Taymyr Peninsula]] to the [[Wadden Sea]] travel via the [[White Sea]] coast and the [[Baltic Sea]] rather than directly across the [[Arctic Ocean]] and northern [[Scandinavia]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.geese.org/gsg/Gorid.htm | title=The Riddle of the White Sea | publisher=Geese.org | date=1999 | accessdate=10 April 2014 | author=Green, Martin}}<!--journal refs at website--></ref>

===In waders===
[[File:BartailedGodwit24.jpg|right|thumb|[[Bar-tailed godwit]]]]

A similar situation occurs with [[wader]]s (called ''shorebirds'' in North America).  Many species, such as [[dunlin]] ''Calidris alpina''<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.birdlife.org.uk/datazone/speciesfactsheet.php?id=3056 | title=Species factsheet: Dunlin Calidris alpina | publisher=BirdLife International | date=2014 | accessdate=19 June 2014}}</ref> and [[western sandpiper]] ''Calidris mauri'',<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.birdlife.org.uk/datazone/speciesfactsheet.php?id=3044 | title=Species factsheet: Western Sandpiper Calidris mauri | publisher=BirdLife International | date=2014 | accessdate=19 June 2014}}</ref> undertake long movements from their Arctic breeding grounds to warmer locations in the same hemisphere, but others such as [[semipalmated sandpiper]] ''C. pusilla'' travel longer distances to the tropics in the Southern Hemisphere.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.birdlife.org.uk/datazone/speciesfactsheet.php?id=3043 | title=Species factsheet: Semipalmated Sandpiper Calidris pusilla | publisher=BirdLife International | date=2014 | accessdate=19 June 2014}}</ref>

For some species of waders, migration success depends on the availability of certain key food resources at stopover points along the migration route. This gives the migrants an opportunity to refuel for the next leg of the voyage. Some examples of important stopover locations are the [[Bay of Fundy]] and [[Delaware River|Delaware Bay]].<ref>{{cite journal | author=Sprague, A. J., D. J. Hamilton, and A. W.

Some [[bar-tailed godwit]]s ''Limosa lapponica'' have the longest known non-stop flight of any migrant, flying 11,000&nbsp;km from [[Alaska]] to their [[New Zealand]] non-breeding areas.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Crossing the ultimate ecological barrier: evidence for an 11,000&nbsp;km-long nonstop flight from Alaska to New Zealand and Eastern Australia by Bar-tailed Godwits |author=Gill, Robert E.

===In seabirds===
[[File:Arctic terns.jpg|thumb|right| The [[arctic tern]] migrates the longest distance of any bird.]]

[[Seabird]] migration is similar in pattern to those of the waders and waterfowl. Some, such as the [[black guillemot]] ''Cepphus grylle'' and some [[gull]]s, are quite sedentary; others, such as most [[tern]]s and [[auk]]s breeding in the temperate northern hemisphere, move varying distances south in the northern winter. The [[Arctic Tern]] ''Sterna paradisaea'' has the longest-distance migration of any bird, and sees more daylight than any other, moving from its Arctic breeding grounds to the Antarctic non-breeding areas.<ref name=Cramp>{{cite book | title=Birds of the Western Palearctic | editor=Cramp, S. | year=1985 | pages=87<U+2013>100 | isbn=0-19-857507-6}}</ref> One Arctic Tern, [[Bird ringing|ringed]] (banded) as a chick on the [[Farne Islands]] off the [[Great Britain|British]] east coast, reached [[Melbourne]], [[Australia]] in just three months from fledging, a sea journey of over {{convert|22,000|km|mi|abbr=on}}.  Many tubenosed birds breed in the southern hemisphere and migrate north in the southern winter.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://pubs.usgs.gov/circ/c1198/chapters/150-161_Seabirds.pdf | title=Seabirds | publisher=USGS | work=Circular 1198 | date=2001 | accessdate=19 June 2014 | author=Pyle, Peter | pages=154}}</ref>

The most pelagic species, mainly in the 'tubenose' order [[Procellariiformes]], are great wanderers, and the [[albatross]]es of the southern oceans may circle the globe as they ride the "roaring forties" outside the breeding season. The tubenoses spread widely over large areas of open ocean, but congregate when food becomes available. Many are also among the longest-distance migrants; [[sooty shearwater]]s ''Puffinus griseus'' nesting on the [[Falkland Islands]] migrate {{convert|14,000|km|mi|abbr=on}} between the breeding colony and the [[Atlantic Ocean|North Atlantic Ocean]] off [[Norway]]. Some [[Manx shearwater]]s ''Puffinus puffinus'' do this same journey in reverse. As they are long-lived birds, they may cover enormous distances during their lives; one record-breaking Manx Shearwater is calculated to have flown 8 million km (5 million miles) during its over-50 year lifespan.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://edition.cnn.com/2002/WORLD/europe/04/18/britain.bird/index.html?iref=allsearch | title=Oldest bird clocks 5 million miles | publisher=CNN.com | date=18 April 2002 | accessdate=31 March 2013 | author=Anon}}</ref>

===Diurnal migration in raptors===
[[File:Vulture 19o05.jpg|right|thumb|[[Griffon vulture]] soaring]]

Some large broad-winged birds rely on [[thermal|thermal columns]] of rising hot air to enable them to soar. These include many [[bird of prey|birds of prey]] such as [[vulture]]s, [[eagle]]s, and [[buzzard]]s, but also [[stork]]s. These birds migrate in the daytime. Migratory species in these groups have great difficulty crossing large bodies of water, since thermals only form over land, and these birds cannot maintain active flight for long distances. Mediterranean and other seas present a major obstacle to soaring birds, which must cross at the narrowest points. Massive numbers of large [[Bird of prey|raptors]] and storks pass through areas such as [[Gibraltar]], [[Falsterbo]], and the [[Bosphorus]] at migration times. More common species, such as the [[European honey buzzard]] ''Pernis apivorus'', can be counted in hundreds of thousands in autumn. Other barriers, such as mountain ranges, can also cause funnelling, particularly of large diurnal migrants. This is a notable factor in the [[Central America]]n migratory bottleneck. Batumi bottleneck in the Caucasus is one of the heaviest migratory funnels on earth. Avoiding flying over the Black Sea surface and across high mountains, hundreds of thousands of soaring birds funnel through an area around the city of [[Batumi]], Georgia.<ref name=Gavashelishvili11>{{cite journal |author=Maanen, E. van; Goradze, I.; Gavashelishvili, A.; Goradze, R. |year=2001 |title=Opinion: Trapping and hunting of migratory raptors in western Georgia |journal=Bird Conservation International |volume=11 |issue=2 |pages=77<U+2013>92 |doi=10.1017/S095927090100017X}}</ref> Birds of prey such as honey buzzards which migrate using thermals lose only 10 to 20% of their weight during migration, which may explain why they forage less during migration than do smaller birds of prey with more active flight such as falcons, hawks and harriers.<ref>Gensbol, B; (1984) Collins Guide to the Birds of Prey of Britain and Europe, p.28</ref>

===Nocturnal migration in smaller insectivorous birds===
[[File:Rubythroathummer65.jpg|thumb|right|[[Ruby-throated hummingbird]]]]

Many of the smaller insectivorous birds including the [[warbler]]s, [[hummingbird]]s and [[Old World flycatcher|flycatchers]] migrate large distances, usually at night. They land in the morning and may feed for a few days before resuming their migration. The birds are referred to as ''passage migrants'' in the regions where they occur for short durations between the origin and destination.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Schmaljohann, Heiko, Felix Liechti and Bruno Bruderer |year=2007 |title=Songbird migration across the Sahara: the non-stop hypothesis rejected! |journal=[[Proceedings of the Royal Society B]] |volume=274|issue=1610|pages=735<U+2013>739|doi=10.1098/rspb.2006.0011 |pmid=17254999 |pmc=2197203}}</ref>

Nocturnal migrants minimize predation, avoid overheating, and can feed during the day.<ref name=Lincoln/> One cost of nocturnal migration is the loss of sleep.

==Short-distance and altitudinal migration==
[[File:Cedar Waxwing-27527-1.jpg|right|thumb|[[Cedar waxwing]]]]

Many long-distance migrants appear to be genetically programmed to respond to changing day length.  Species that move short distances, however, may not need such a timing mechanism, instead moving in response to local weather conditions. Thus mountain and moorland breeders, such as [[wallcreeper]] ''Tichodroma muraria'' and [[white-throated dipper]] ''Cinclus cinclus'', may move only altitudinally to escape the cold higher ground. Other species such as [[Merlin (bird)|merlin]] ''Falco columbarius'' and [[Eurasian skylark]] ''Alauda arvensis'' move further, to the coast or towards the south. Species like the chaffinch are much less migratory in [[Great Britain|Britain]] than those of continental Europe, mostly not moving more than 5&nbsp;km in their lives.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://sounds.bl.uk/environment/british-wildlife-recordings/022m-w1cdr0001384-0700v0 | title=British Wildlife Recordings: Chaffinch | publisher=British Library | accessdate=10 April 2014}}</ref>

Short-distance passerine migrants have two evolutionary origins. Those that have long-distance migrants in the same family, such as the [[common chiffchaff]] ''Phylloscopus collybita'', are species of southern hemisphere origins that have progressively shortened their return migration to stay in the northern hemisphere.<ref>Cocker, 2005. p. 378</ref>

Species that have no long-distance migratory relatives, such as the [[waxwing]]s ''Bombycilla'', are effectively moving in response to winter weather and the loss of their usual winter food, rather than enhanced breeding opportunities.<ref name=CockerWaxwing>Cocker, 2005. p. 326</ref>

In the tropics there is little variation in the length of day throughout the year, and it is always warm enough for a food supply, but altitudinal migration occurs in some tropical birds. There is evidence that this enables the migrants to obtain more of their preferred foods such as fruits.<ref>{{cite journal | url=http://www.aliceboyle.net/My%20Articles/Boyle%20et%20al%202011_EvolEcol.pdf | title=Why do some, but not all, tropical birds migrate?

Altitudinal migration is common on mountains worldwide, such as in the [[Himalayas]] and the [[Andes]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.groms.de/groms/work25/vortrag/KREFT.PDF | title=The Fourth Dimension: An Overview of Altitudinal Migration | publisher=25th Annual Bonn Convention, Berlin | date=23 June 2004 | accessdate=27 March 2013 | author=Kreft, Stefan}}</ref>

==Irruptions and dispersal==
[[File:Matthew Paris 1251 sketch of Crossbill eating fruit.jpg|thumb|Mediaeval sketch by [[Matthew Paris]] in his ''Chronica Majora'' (1251) recording that year's major irruption of [[red crossbill]]s into England]]
Sometimes circumstances such as a good breeding season followed by a food source failure the following year lead to irruptions in which large numbers of a species move far beyond the normal range. [[Bohemian waxwing]]s ''Bombycilla garrulus'' well show this unpredictable variation in annual numbers, with five major arrivals in Britain during the nineteenth century, but 18 between the years 1937 and 2000.<ref name=CockerWaxwing/> [[Red crossbill]]s ''Loxia curvirostra'' too are irruptive, with widespread invasions across England noted in 1251, 1593, 1757, and 1791.<ref>Cocker, 2005. p. 455</ref>

Bird migration is primarily, but not entirely, a Northern Hemisphere phenomenon.<ref>{{cite journal | url=http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0070907 | title=Mapping Global Diversity Patterns for Migratory Birds | author=Somveille M, Manica A, Butchart SHM, Rodrigues ASL | journal=PLOS one | year=2013 | volume=8 | issue=8 | pages=e70907 | doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0070907}}</ref>
This is because land birds in high northern latitudes, where food becomes scarce in winter, leave for areas further south (including the Southern Hemisphere) to overwinter, and because the continental landmass is much larger in the Northern Hemisphere. In contrast, among (pelagic) seabirds, species of the Southern Hemisphere are more likely to migrate. This is because there is a large area of ocean in the Southern Hemisphere, and more islands suitable for seabirds to nest.<ref>{{cite book | url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=BndIbshDWTgC&pg=PA396 | title=The Migration Ecology of Birds | publisher=Academic Press | author=Newton, Ian | year=2010 | pages=396, and throughout | chapter=13. Large-Scale Movement Patterns}}</ref>

==Physiology and control==
The control of migration, its timing and response are genetically controlled and appear to be a primitive trait that is present even in non-migratory species of birds. The ability to navigate and orient themselves during migration is a much more complex phenomenon that may include both endogenous programs as well as learning.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Helm B, Gwinner E |year=2006|title= Migratory Restlessness in an Equatorial Nonmigratory Bird |journal=PLoS Biol. |volume=4|issue=4|page=e110 |doi=10.1371/journal.pbio.0040110|pmid=16555925|pmc=1420642}}</ref>

===Timing===
The primary physiological cue for migration are the changes in the day length. These changes are also related to hormonal changes in the birds. In the period before migration, many birds display higher activity or [[Zugunruhe]] ({{lang-de|migratory restlessness}}), first described by [[Johann Friedrich Naumann]] in 1795, as well as physiological changes such as increased fat deposition. The occurrence of Zugunruhe even in cage-raised birds with no environmental cues (e.g. shortening of day and falling temperature) has pointed to the role of circannual [[endogenous]] programs in controlling bird migrations.<ref>{{cite journal | title=Stopover decision during migration: physiological conditions predict nocturnal restlessness in wild passerines | author=Fusani, L.; Cardinale, L.; Carere, C.; Goymann, W. | journal=Biology Letters | year=2009 | doi=10.1098/rsbl.2008.0755}}</ref> Caged birds display a preferential flight direction that corresponds with the migratory direction they would take in nature, changing their preferential direction at roughly the same time their wild conspecifics change course.<ref>{{cite journal | url=http://jeb.biologists.org/content/202/16/2225.full.pdf | title=MIGRATORY DIRECTIONS OF FREE-FLYING BIRDS VERSUS ORIENTATION IN REGISTRATION CAGES | author=Nievergelt, F.; Liechti, F.; Bruderer, B. | journal=Journal of Experimental Biology | year=1999 | volume=202 | pages=2225<U+2013>2231}}</ref>

In [[polygyny|polygynous]] species with considerable [[sexual dimorphism]], males tend to return earlier to the breeding sites than their females. This is termed protandry.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Diego Rubolini, Fernando Spina and Nicola Saino |year=2004 |title=Protandry and sexual dimorphism in trans-Saharan migratory birds|journal=Behavioral Ecology |volume=15 |issue=4 |pages=592<U+2013>601 |url=http://beheco.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/abstract/15/4/592 |doi=10.1093/beheco/arh048}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Edwards, Darryl B.; Forbes, Mark R. |year=2007 |title= Absence of protandry in the spring migration of a population of Song Sparrows Melospiza melodia|journal=Ibis |volume=149 |issue=4 |pages=715<U+2013>720 |doi=10.1111/j.1474-919X.2007.00692.x}}</ref>

===Orientation and navigation===
[[File:Bar-tailed Godwit migration.jpg|thumb|300px|The routes of satellite tagged [[Bar-tailed godwit]]s migrating north from [[New Zealand]]. This species has the longest known non-stop migration of any species, up to {{convert|10200|km|mi|-2|abbr=on}}.]]
{{main|Animal navigation}}
[[Animal navigation|Navigation]] is based on a variety of senses. Many birds have been shown to use a sun compass. Using the sun for direction involves the need for making compensation based on the time. Navigation has also been shown to be based on a combination of other abilities including the ability to detect magnetic fields ([[magnetoception]]), use visual landmarks as well as [[olfactory navigation|olfactory cues]].<ref name=walraffpigeon>{{cite book |author=Walraff, H. G. |year=2005 |title= Avian Navigation: Pigeon Homing as a Paradigm |publisher= Springer}}</ref>

Long distance migrants are believed to disperse as young birds and form attachments to potential breeding sites and to favourite wintering sites. Once the site attachment is made they show high site-fidelity, visiting the same wintering sites year after year.<ref>{{cite book|author=Ketterson, E.D. and V. Nolan Jr. |year=1990 |chapter= Site attachment and site fidelity in migratory birds: experimental evidence from the field and analogies from neurobiology.|title=Bird Migration |editor=E. Gwinner |publisher=Springer Verlag |pages=117<U+2013>129 |url=http://www.indiana.edu/~kettlab/ellen/pubs/KettersonNolan1990.pdf |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5nRF4ThAw |archivedate=2010-02-10 |format=PDF}}</ref>

The ability of birds to navigate during migrations cannot be fully explained by endogenous programming, even with the help of responses to environmental cues. The ability to successfully perform long-distance migrations can probably only be fully explained with an accounting for the cognitive ability of the birds to recognize habitats and form mental maps. [[Satellite tracking (animal migration)|Satellite tracking]] of day migrating raptors such as Ospreys and Honey Buzzards has shown that older individuals are better at making corrections for wind drift.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Thorup, Kasper, Thomas Alerstam, Mikael Hake and Nils Kjelle |year=2003 |title=Bird orientation: compensation for wind drift in migrating raptors is age dependent |journal=[[Proceedings of the Royal Society B]] |volume=270 |pages=S8<U+2013>S11 |doi=10.1098/rsbl.2003.0014 |pmid=12952622 |pmc=1698035 |issue=Suppl 1}}</ref>

Migratory birds may use two [[Electromagnetism|electromagnetic]] tools to find their destinations: one that is entirely innate and another that relies on experience. A young bird on its first migration flies in the correct direction according to the Earth's [[magnetic field]], but does not know how far the journey will be. It does this through a [[radical pair mechanism]] whereby chemical reactions in special [[biological pigment|photo pigments]] sensitive to [[Color#Physics|long wavelengths]] are affected by the field. Although this only works during daylight hours, it does not use the position of the sun in any way. At this stage the bird is in the position of a [[boy scout]] with a compass but no map, until it grows accustomed to the journey and can put its other capabilities to use. With experience it learns various landmarks and this "mapping" is done by [[magnetite]]s in the [[trigeminal system]], which tell the bird how strong the field is. Because birds migrate between northern and southern regions, the magnetic field strengths at different [[latitude]]s let it interpret the radical pair mechanism more accurately and let it know when it has reached its destination.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Wiltschko, W., U. Munro, H. Ford & R.

===Vagrancy===
Migrating birds can lose their way and appear outside their normal ranges. This can be due to flying past their destinations as in the "spring overshoot"{{anchor|overshoot}} in which birds returning to their breeding areas overshoot and end up further north than intended. Certain areas, because of their location, have become famous as watchpoints for such birds. Examples are the [[Point Pelee National Park]] in Canada, and [[Spurn]] in [[England]].

[[Reverse migration (bird migration)|Reverse migration]], where the genetic programming of young birds fails to work properly, can lead to rarities turning up as vagrants thousands of kilometres out of range.<ref>{{cite journal | url=http://www.zmuc.dk/VerWeb/staff/kthorup/Kt-pdf/BirdStudy51-228.pdf | title=Reverse migration as a cause of vagrancy | author=Thorup, Kasper | journal=Bird Study | year=2004 | volume=51 | pages=228<U+2013>238 | doi=10.1080/00063650409461358}}</ref>

[[Drift migration]] of birds blown off course by the wind can result in "falls" of large numbers of migrants at coastal sites.<ref>{{cite journal | url=http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/270/Suppl_1/S8 | title=Bird orientation: compensation for wind drift in migrating raptors is age dependent | author=Kasper Thorup,  Thomas Alerstam,  Mikael Hake, Nils Kjell<U+00E9>n | journal=Proc. Royal Soc. London B | year=2003 | volume=270 | issue=Suppl 1 | pages=S8-S11 | doi=10.1098/rsbl.2003.0014}}</ref>

A related phenomenon called "abmigration" involves birds from one region joining similar birds from a different breeding region in the common winter grounds and then migrating back along with the new population. This is especially common in some waterfowl, which shift from one flyway to another.<ref>Guillemain, M., Sadoul, N. and Simon, G. (2005), European flyway permeability and abmigration in Teal Anas crecca, an analysis based on ringing recoveries. Ibis, 147: 688<U+2013>696. {{DOI|10.1111/j.1474-919X.2005.00446.x}}</ref>

===Migration conditioning===
It has been possible to teach a migration route to a flock of birds, for example in re-introduction schemes. After a trial with [[Canada Goose|Canada Geese]] ''Branta canadensis'', [[microlight]] aircraft were used in the US to teach safe migration routes to reintroduced [[Whooping Crane]]s ''Grus americana''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.operationmigration.org/index.html|title=Operation migration}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://dnr.wi.gov/files/pdf/pubs/er/er0650.pdf |title=Wisconsin Whooping Crane Management Plan | format = PDF | publisher = Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources | date = 6 December 2006}}</ref>

==Adaptations==
Birds need to alter their metabolism in order to meet the demands of migration. The storage of energy through the accumulation of fat and the control of sleep in nocturnal migrants require special physiological adaptations. In addition, the feathers of a bird suffer from wear-and-tear and require to be molted. The timing of this molt - usually once a year but sometimes twice - varies with some species molting prior to moving to their winter grounds and others molting prior to returning to their breeding grounds.<ref>{{cite book |editor=Greenberg R & Marra PP |page=94 |title=Birds of two worlds: the ecology and evolution of migration |publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press |year= 2005 |isbn=0-8018-8107-2 |chapter=Ecology and Demography of East-West Differences in Molt Scheduling of Neotropical Migrant Passerines |author=Rohwer S; Butler LK & DR Froehlich }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |title=Adaptations to migration in birds: behavioural strategies, morphology and scaling effects |journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B | year=2008 |volume=363 |pages=287<U+2013>299 |doi=10.1098/rstb.2007.2140 |pmid=17638691 |author=Hedenstr<U+00F6>m, A. |issue=1490 |pmc=2606751}}</ref> Apart from physiological adaptations, migration sometimes requires behavioural changes such as flying in flocks to reduce the energy used in migration or the risk of predation.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Weber, Jean-Michel |title=The physiology of long-distance migration: extending the limits of endurance metabolism |journal=J.

==Evolutionary and ecological factors==
Migration in birds is highly labile and is believed to have developed independently in many avian lineages.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Pulido, F. |year=2007 |title= The genetics and evolution of avian migration |journal=BioScience |volume=57 |pages=165<U+2013>174 |doi=10.1641/b570211}}</ref> While it is agreed that the behavioral and physiological adaptations necessary for migration are under genetic control, some authors have argued that no genetic change is necessary for migratory behavior to develop in a sedentary species because the genetic framework for migratory behavior exists in nearly all avian lineages.<ref>{{cite journal |author=J. Rappole, B. Helm, M. Ramos |year=2003 |title= An integrative framework for understanding the origin and evolution of avian migration |journal=Journal of Avian Biology |volume=34 |page=125 |doi=10.1034/j.1600-048x.2003.03170.x}}</ref> This explains the rapid appearance of migratory behavior after the most recent glacial maximum.<ref>{{cite journal |author=B.

Theoretical analyses show that detours that increase flight distance by up to 20% will often be adaptive on [[aerodynamics|aerodynamic]] grounds - a bird that loads itself with food to cross a long barrier flies less efficiently. However some species show circuitous migratory routes that reflect historical range expansions and are far from optimal in ecological terms. An example is the migration of continental populations of [[Swainson's thrush]] ''Catharus ustulatus'', which fly far east across [[North America]] before turning south via [[Florida]] to reach northern [[South America]]; this route is believed to be the consequence of a range expansion that occurred about 10,000 years ago. Detours may also be caused by differential wind conditions, predation risk, or other factors.<ref>{{cite journal | author=Alerstam, Thomas | year=2001 |title=Detours in bird migration | journal=Journal of Theoretical Biology | volume=209 | pages=319<U+2013>331 | url=http://www.mbfys.ru.nl/staff/j.vangisbergen/endnote/endnotepdfs/navigatie/Alerstam_detours_2001.pdf | format=PDF | doi=10.1006/jtbi.2001.2266}}</ref>

===Climate change===
Large scale climatic changes, as have been experienced in the past, are expected to have an effect on the timing of migration. Studies have shown a variety of effects including timing changes in migration, breeding<ref>{{cite journal |author=Jenni L. & Kery M. |year=2003 |title= Timing of autumn bird migration under climate change: advances in long-distance migrants, delays in short-distance migrants |journal=[[Proceedings of the Royal Society B]] |volume=270 |page=1467 |doi=10.1098/rspb.2003.2394}}</ref> as well as population variations.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/nature04539 |issn = 0028-0836 |volume=441 |issue=7089 |pages=81<U+2013>83 |last=Both |first=Christiaan |author2=Sandra Bouwhuis |author3=C.

==Ecological effects==
The migration of birds also aids the movement of other species, including those of [[ectoparasite]]s such as ticks and lice,<ref>{{cite journal |author=Smith RP Jr, Rand PW, Lacombe EH, Morris SR, Holmes DW, Caporale DA | year=1996 |title=Role of bird migration in the long-distance dispersal of ''Ixodes dammini'', the vector of Lyme disease | journal=J.

Bird migration routes have been studied by a variety of techniques including the oldest, marking. Swans have been marked with a nick on the beak since about 1560 in England. Scientific [[Bird ringing|ringing]] was pioneered by [[Hans Christian Cornelius Mortensen]] in 1899.<ref>Spencer, R. (1985) ''Marking''. In: Campbell. B. & Lack, E. 1985. ''A dictionary of birds''.

Stable isotopes of hydrogen, oxygen, carbon, nitrogen, and sulphur can establish avian migratory connectivity between wintering sites and breeding grounds. Stable isotopic methods to establish migratory linkage rely on spatial isotopic differences in bird diet that are incorporated into inert tissues like feathers, or into growing tissues such as claws and muscle or blood.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Keith Hobson, Leonard Wassenaar |title=Linking breeding and wintering grounds of neotropical migrant songbirds using stable hydrogen isotopic analysis of feathers |journal=Oecologia |year=1997 |volume=109 |pages=142<U+2013>148 |doi=10.1007/s004420050068}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Gabriel Bowen, Leonard Wassenaar, Keith Hobson |title=Global application of stable hydrogen and oxygen isotopes to wildlife forensics |journal=Oecologia |year=2005 |volume=143 |pages=337<U+2013>348 |doi=10.1007/s00442-004-1813-y |pmid=15726429 |issue=3}}</ref>

An older technique to quantify migration involves observing the face of the moon towards full moon and counting the silhouettes of flocks of birds as they fly at night.<ref>{{cite book|author=Liechti, F. |year=1996|title= Instructions to count nocturnal bird migration by watching the full moon. |publisher=[[Sempach Bird Observatory|Schweizerische Vogelwarte]], CH-6204 Sempach, Switzerland}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|author=Lowery, G.H. |year=1951 |title=A quantitative study of the nocturnal migration of birds |journal=University Kan.

Orientation behaviour studies have been traditionally carried out using variants of a setup known as the Emlen funnel, which consists of a circular cage with the top covered by glass or wire-screen so that either the sky is visible or the setup is placed in a planetarium or with other controls on environmental cues. The orientation behaviour of the bird inside the cage is studied quantitatively using the distribution of marks that the bird leaves on the walls of the cage.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Emlen, S. T. and Emlen, J. T. |year=1966 |title= A technique for recording migratory orientation of captive birds |journal=Auk |volume=83 |pages=361<U+2013>367 |doi=10.2307/4083048}}</ref> Other approaches used in pigeon homing studies make use of the direction in which the bird vanishes on the horizon.<ref>Alerstam, 1993. p.352</ref>

==Threats and conservation==
{{main|Bird migration perils}}

[[File:Illegal hunting on migratory birds in europe.png|thumb|right|150px|Migration routes and countries with illegal hunting in Europe]]
Human activities have threatened many migratory bird species. The distances involved in bird migration mean that they often cross political boundaries of countries and conservation measures require international cooperation. Several international treaties have been signed to protect migratory species including the [[Migratory Bird Treaty Act]] of 1918 of the US.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/16/ch7.html |title=Migratory bird Treaty 16 USC 703-711; 40 Stat. 755|publisher= Cornell Law School|work=Legal Information Institute (LII)}}</ref> and the [[African-Eurasian Migratory Waterbird Agreement]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.unep-aewa.org/documents/index.htm |title=African-Eurasian Migratory Waterbird Agreement}}</ref>

The concentration of birds during migration can put species at risk. Some spectacular migrants have already gone extinct; during the [[passenger pigeon]]'s (''Ectopistes migratorius'') migration the enormous flocks were a mile (1.6&nbsp;km) wide, darkening the sky and {{convert|300|mi|km}} long, taking several days to pass.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.si.edu/encyclopedia_Si/nmnh/passpig.htm | title=The Passenger Pigeon | publisher=Smithsonian Institution | accessdate=2013-05-24}}</ref>

Other significant areas include stop-over sites between the wintering and breeding territories.<ref>{{cite journal | author=Shimazaki, Hiroto; Masayuki Tamura and Hiroyoshi Higuchi | year=2004 | title= Migration routes and important stopover sites of endangered oriental white storks (''Ciconia boyciana'') as revealed by satellite tracking | journal= Mem [[Natl Inst.

[[Hunting]] along migration routes threatens some bird species. The populations of [[Siberian crane]]s (''Leucogeranus leucogeranus'') that wintered in [[India]] declined due to hunting along the route, particularly in [[Afghanistan]] and [[Central Asia]]. Birds were last seen in their favourite wintering grounds in [[Keoladeo National Park]] in 2002.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.savingcranes.org/species/siberian.cfm | title=Siberian Crane fact sheet}}</ref> Structures such as power lines, wind farms and offshore oil-rigs have also been known to affect migratory birds.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.fws.gov/birds/mortality-fact-sheet.pdf | title=Fish and Wildlife Service- Bird Mortality Fact sheet}}</ref> Other [[bird migration perils|migration hazards]] include pollution, storms, wildfires, and habitat destruction along migration routes, denying migrants food at stopover points.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://birding.about.com/od/Threats/a/Threats-To-Migrating-Birds.htm | title=Threats to Migrating Birds | publisher=About.com Birding | accessdate=19 June 2014 | author=Mayntz, Melissa}}</ref> For example, in the [[East Asian<U+2013>Australasian Flyway]], up to 65% of key intertidal habitat at the Yellow Sea migration bottleneck has been destroyed since the 1950s.<ref name = Murray>Murray N.
