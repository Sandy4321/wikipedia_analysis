'''JKA England''' (JKAE)<ref>[http://www.jka-england.org JKAE Homepage]</ref> is the official '''Japan Karate Association''' ([[JKA]]) organisation for [[Shotokan karate]] in England and Wales. 
Every year JKAE holds spring and summer courses inviting instructors from the JKA honbu dojo to teach.

==History==

JKAE was officially formed in 2003 by several clubs from [[KUGB]]. Following the death of Enoeda, formerly chief representative of JKA in the UK and head of KUGB, there was a disagreement between the JKA, the KUGB, [[Andy Sherry]] (the next highest ranked instructor) and Yoshinobu Ohta (Enoeda's assistant). The result was that JKAE was formed with Ohta as chief instructor and the KUGB withdrew from the JKA with Andy Sherry as their chief instructor. Some KUGB clubs transferred to JKAE to form the new association, they possibly wanted to remain affiliated to the JKA or perhaps had a stronger sense of loyalty to Ohta. The division had a strong geographic correlation: most northern clubs chose KUGB and most southern clubs chose JKAE.
