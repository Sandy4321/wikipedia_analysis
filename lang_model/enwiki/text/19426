He was educated at the [[Emerson Institute]] and a variety of other private schools located in both the United States and [[Germany]].<ref name="McMullin & Walker">{{cite book |last=McMullin |first=Thomas A. |last2=Walker |first2=David |title=Biographical Directory of American Territorial Governors |publisher=Meckler Publishing|location=Westport, CT |date=1984 | isbn = 0-930466-11-X | pages=15-7}}</ref>  He studied [[civil engineering]] at [[Princeton University]], graduating in 1894.<ref name="McMullin & Walker"/><ref name="NYTobit">{{cite news |title=Thomas Riggs |page=1 |newspaper=New York Times |date=January 17, 1945 }}</ref>

Following graduation he moved with his family to [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington State]] and took a job as a [[newspaper]] reporter in [[Tacoma, Washington|Tacoma]].  In 1896 he joined his family's [[lumber]] business in [[Bucoda, Washington|Bucoda]] before joining the [[Klondike Gold Rush]] the next year.  From 1897 to 1901, Riggs prospected for gold near both [[Dawson City]] and [[Nome, Alaska]] with little success.  From 1901 to 1903 he worked as a mining engineer in [[Idaho]], [[Montana]], and [[Utah]].<ref name="McMullin & Walker"/>

In 1903, Riggs joined the United States and Canada Boundary Survey.  From 1906 to 1913 he worked on the team assigned to survey the Alaskan-Canadian border and advanced from the position of surveyor to become the United States Engineer-in-Charge.<ref name="McMullin & Walker"/>  During this effort, the team surveyed the boundary from the [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific]] to [[Arctic Ocean]]s, placed boundary markers, and cleared wooded areas to provide a clear line of sight between markers.<ref name="Boundary surveyors">{{cite news |title=Old Boundary Surveyors Miss Meeting; Determined American-Canadian Line in 1902 |page=52 |newspaper=New York Times |date=September 19, 1937 }}</ref>

Riggs married Ren<U+00E9>e Marie Coudert on April 30, 1913 in [[New York City]].  The marriage produced two children: Elizabeth C. and Thomas III.<ref name="McMullin & Walker"/>

Following his work surveying the Alaskan-Canadian border, on May 4, 1914, Riggs was appointed by President [[Woodrow Wilson]] to the Alaskan Railroad Commission.<ref name="Alaskan railroad">{{cite news |title=Alaskan Board Complete |page=10 |newspaper=New York Times |date=May 5, 1914 |url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9407E6DD173AE633A25756C0A9639C946596D6CF }}</ref>
Along with the other two commissioners he oversaw the construction of the [[Alaska Railroad]], Riggs being responsible for the [[Fairbanks, Alaska|Fairbanks]] division.<ref name="McMullin & Walker"/>

==Governorship==
[[United States Secretary of the Interior]] [[Franklin Knight Lane]] was impressed by Riggs' experience and recommended his appointment as Governor of Alaska Territory to President [[Woodrow Wilson]].<ref name="McMullin & Walker"/>  Following his confirmation, the new governor was sworn into office on April 12, 1918.<ref>{{cite news |title=Thomas Riggs Jr. Will be Confirmed Governor of Alaska |page=4 |newspaper=Dallas Morning News |date=April 7, 1918 }}</ref><ref name="swearing in">{{cite book |last=Madden |first=Ryan |title=Alaska |publisher=Interlink Books|location=Northampton, MA |date=2005 | isbn = 1-56656-566-9 | pages=302}}</ref>

The United States had already entered the [[First World War]] by the time he entered office and the new governor encourageded Alaska to support the war effort.  Under Riggs, the territory was a leader in the sale of both [[war savings stamp]]s and [[Liberty Bond]]s.<ref name="McMullin & Walker"/>  The new governor also worked to overlaps between the territorial and federal governmental functions.  He was successful in the areas of education, mine inspections, and road building but met strong resistance in his efforts to consolidate efforts within Alaska's [[General Land Office|Land Office]].<ref name="McMullin & Walker"/>

Transportation was a major problem within the territory, with Riggs believing private [[shipping]] firms were providing unfair and inadequate service to Alaska.  To rectify this problem, he proposed Alaska establish a fleet of transport ships and begin a territorial shipping service.  The territorial legislature approved the plan but the [[U.S. Congress]] blocked it before the fleet could be established.<ref name="McMullin & Walker"/>

To deal with the [[Spanish flu]], In October 1918 Riggs ordered doctors to meet arriving steamships upon arrival to inspect for signs of the virus and that transport firms refuse passage to the territory by anyone who was ill.  The precautions were unsuccessful with the first case reaching Juneau on October 14 and widespread outbreaks being present a month later.<ref name="spanish flu">{{cite book |last=O'Keefe |first=Betty |first2=Ian David |last2=MacDonald |title=Dr. Fred and the Spanish lady: fighting the killer flu |publisher=Heritage House|location=Surrey, BC |date=2004 | isbn = 1-894384-71-7 | pages=172-3}}</ref>  In response to the flu's arrival, Riggs established a ''[[cordon sanitaire]]'' on all trails to the interior, but unfortunately the couriers carrying announcements of the quarantine may have also spread the disease.<ref name="crosby">{{cite book |last=Crosby |first=Alfred W. |title=America's Forgotten Pandemic: The Influenza of 1918 |publisher=Cambridge University Press | |date=1989 | isbn = 0-521-38547-4 | pages=251-5}}</ref>  The [[Alaska Natives|native]] population proved especially vulnerable, with up to an eight percent mortality rate during the pandemic.<ref name="cruelest miles">{{cite book |last=Salisbury |first=Gay |first2=Laney |last2=Salisbury |title=The cruelest miles |publisher=W.W. Norton & Co|location=New York |date=2003 | isbn = 0393019624 | pages=42}}</ref>  This left hundreds of orphans and entire villages who's populations were unable to perform basic activities such as prepare meals or chop firewood.  In response, Riggs exceeded authorized funding levels in his spending on medical supplies, maintaining the quarantine, and providing relief efforts.  The territory's financial situation was further complicated when a request for a US$200,000 special allocation was cut in half by the [[U.S. Senate]] and rejected completely by the [[U.S. House of Representatives]].<ref name="crosby"/>

The end of his term of office came after the election of [[Warren Harding]] as [[President of the United States]].  Riggs left office on June 15, 1921, making way for Republican appointee [[Scott Cordelle Bone]].<ref name="out of office">{{cite news |title=Bone Sworn in as Alaska Governor |page=6 |newspaper=New York Times |date=June 16, 1921 |url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9804EED91631EF33A25755C1A9609C946095D6CF }}</ref>

==Later life==

There he worked in the mining, oil, and construction industries and was named Vice-President of Macassa Mines, Ltd. of Canada.<ref name="McMullin & Walker"/> On August 2, 1935, Riggs was named the United States Commissioner to the [[Canada <U+2013> United States border#International Boundary Commission|International Boundary Commission]].<ref name="Canadian Boundary">{{cite news |title=Thomas Riggs Is Named Us Engineer On Canadian Boundary |page=7 |newspaper=Montreal Gazette  |date=August 3, 1935 |url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=N74tAAAAIBAJ&sjid=yJgFAAAAIBAJ&pg=3194,292933 }}</ref>
