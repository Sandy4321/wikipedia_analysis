'''Sir Leonard Hutton''' (23 June 1916 <U+2013> 6 September 1990), commonly named '''Len Hutton''', was an [[England national cricket team|English]] [[Test cricket]]er, who played for [[Yorkshire County Cricket Club]] and England in the years around the [[Second World War]] as an [[Batting order (cricket)#Opening batsmen|opening batsman]]. He was described by ''[[Wisden Cricketer's Almanack]]'' as one of the greatest batsmen in the history of [[cricket]]. In 1938, he set a record for the highest individual innings in a [[test cricket|Test match]], scoring 364 against Australia, which stood for nearly 20 years. In 1952, he became the first professional cricketer of the twentieth century to captain England in a Test match and under his captaincy England won [[the Ashes]] the following year for the first time in 19 years. In the years immediately following the war, he was the mainstay of the Test team's batting.

Marked out as a potential star from his teenage years, Hutton made his debut for Yorkshire in 1934 and quickly established himself. He first played for England in 1937, and went on to break the Test innings record in only his sixth Test. By the time the war broke out, he had established himself as one of the leading batsmen in England. However, during the war, he received a serious injury to his arm and took a long time to recover and this affected his batting afterwards. When cricket resumed, Hutton again became one of England's leading batsmen and by the time of England's tour to Australia in 1950&ndash;51, the batting relied very heavily on him. He was chosen as England captain in 1952 to mixed reactions, but with his batting making a large contribution, England were able to regain the Ashes in 1953. Hutton continued as captain, although his leadership was at times controversial, until 1954&ndash;55. Worn out by the mental and physical demands of his role, Hutton retired from all cricket. He was knighted for his contributions to cricket in 1956. He went on to be a Test selector, a journalist and broadcaster. He also took up a career as a representative for an engineering firm, Fenner's.

==Early life==
Hutton was born on 23 June 1916, the youngest of five children to Henry Hutton and Lily Swithenbank, in the [[Moravian Church|Moravian]] community of [[Fulneck]], [[Pudsey]]. From 1921, Hutton attended Littlemoor Council School in Pudsey.<ref>Howat, pp.4&ndash;6.</ref> His family had a cricketing background: his father and brothers had played for [[Pudsey St Lawrence Cricket Club]], while his father also played for their rivals Pudsey Brittania.<ref>Hutton (1948), p. 18.</ref> Hutton soon immersed himself in playing and reading about the sport and later cited a book by [[Jack Hobbs]] as a particular inspiration.<ref name=coy/> Hutton joined St Lawrence as a junior, making his first appearance for the club's second eleven aged twelve. By 1929, Hutton was playing for the first eleven, [[Batting average#Cricket|averaging]] 34.50 with the bat and taking eleven wickets.<ref name=Hu20>Hutton (1948), p. 20.</ref><ref>Howat, pp.6&ndash;7.</ref> At this stage, Hutton came under the influence of [[Yorkshire County Cricket Club|Yorkshire]] and England cricketer [[Herbert Sutcliffe]] when sent to Sutcliffe's home to be coached. Impressed by Hutton, Sutcliffe and the Pudsey St Lawrence president recommended him to Yorkshire. Hutton went to the indoor practice shed at [[Headingley Stadium|Headingley]] in 1930.<ref name=Hu20/><ref name=H7>Howat, p.7.</ref><ref name=H170>Hill, p.170.</ref> Former player [[George Hirst]], responsible for assessing and coaching young players, told him to keep on playing the way he was, and on another occasion told him that there was nothing to teach him he did not already know.<ref name=H170/> Hirst arranged for [[Bill Bowes]], the Yorkshire pace bowler, to bowl at Hutton in the practice shed. Bowes judged Hutton to have a very good technique. Hutton later expressed his appreciation for Bowes' guidance and for his advice to Yorkshire not to rush Hutton's development.<ref name=H8/><ref name=Hu22>Hutton (1948), pp. 22&ndash;23.</ref> Around this time, Hutton watched [[Don Bradman]] score 334 [[not out]] at Headingley in a Test match, the score which Hutton passed eight years later.<ref name=H7/>

The opinions of the critics led Hutton to consider a career in professional cricket, but he decided to learn a trade first, at the wish of his parents. He spent a year at Pudsey Grammar School studying technical drawing, quantitative work and electrical work. Subsequently, he joined his father working for a building firm, for whom he continued to work during the winter once he joined Yorkshire.<ref name=H8>Howat, p.8.</ref>

==Career before the Second World War==
===First years with Yorkshire===
By 1933, Hutton was playing regularly for the Pudsey St Lawrence first team in the [[Bradford Cricket League]]. He opened the batting with [[Edgar Oldroyd]] who had just ended his career with Yorkshire, and was initially reluctant to partner such a young player. Hutton developed his technique through close observation of Oldroyd, who came to accept Hutton's ability. The local press described him as a very promising player, particularly after he scored a match-winning 108 [[not out]] in the [[Priestley Cup]].<ref name=Hu22/><ref>Howat, pp.10&ndash;11.</ref> In the same season, Hutton was selected for Yorkshire Second Eleven for the first time, and despite beginning with [[Duck (cricket)|ducks]] in his first two innings, scored 699 runs at an average of 69.90. The ''[[Yorkshire Post]]'' described him as having a good defence but being too cautious at times.<ref>Howat, pp. 12&ndash;13.</ref> Other figures within Pudsey and Yorkshire cricket, including the Yorkshire secretary [[John Nash (cricket administrator)|John Nash]], county captain [[Brian Sellers]] and coach George Hirst, believed that Hutton was very promising, and he was mentioned as a likely successor to [[Percy Holmes]] as an opening partner to Sutcliffe. His [[leg spin]] was also seen as having potential.<ref>Howat, pp.13&ndash;15.</ref>

Hutton made his first-class d<U+00E9>but for Yorkshire the following season, at the age of seventeen, becoming the youngest Yorkshire player since Hirst, 45 years before. [[Run out]] for [[duck (cricket)|a duck]] in his first innings, he made a not out fifty in his second match.<ref name=figures>{{cite web| url = http://www.cricketarchive.com/cgi-bin/player_oracle_reveals_results2.cgi?playernumber=694&opponentmatch=exact&playername=&resulttype=All&matchtype=All&teammatch=exact&startwicket=&homeawaytype=All&opponent=&endwicket=&wicketkeeper=&searchtype=InningsList&endscore=&playermatch=contains&branding=cricketarchive&captain=&endseason=&startscore=&team=&startseason=| title = Player Oracle (L Hutton)| publisher = CricketArchive| accessdate = 27 October 2010}}</ref> He made his [[County Championship]] debut and scored fifty in his first match, making an impression on the press with his defence.<ref>Howat, pp.15&ndash;16.</ref> Yorkshire appointed [[Cyril Turner (cricketer)|Cyril Turner]] to mentor Hutton and ease his way into the life of a professional cricketer. [[Bill Bowes]] and [[Hedley Verity]] also looked after the young cricketer in his first seasons.<ref>Howat, p. 17.</ref><ref name="Hodgson, p. 139">Hodgson, p. 139.</ref> Yorkshire limited his first team appearances and returned him periodically to the second eleven to prevent his overexposure to Championship cricket early in his career.<ref>Howat, pp.19&ndash;20.</ref> On the field, Hutton contributed 70 runs to a first wicket [[Partnership (cricket)|partnership]] of 267 with [[Wilf Barber]],<ref name="Howat, p.16">Howat, p.16.</ref> and shared an opening stand of 155 with [[Arthur Mitchell (cricketer)|Arthur Mitchell]], before scoring his maiden first-class century in an innings of 196 against [[Worcestershire County Cricket Club]].<ref>Howat, p.19.</ref> He received some criticism, particularly from ''The Times'', for slow scoring and a lack of strokes but was complimented on his patience.<ref name="Howat, p.16"/> He finished the season with 863 runs at an average of 33.19.<ref name=fcbatting>{{cite web| url = http://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Players/0/694/f_Batting_by_Season.html| title = First-class Batting and Fielding in Each Season by Len Hutton| publisher = CricketArchive| accessdate = 5 February 2010}}</ref>

In early 1935, Herbert Sutcliffe's autobiography was released in which he praised Hutton and drew attention to his ability and potential. He described Hutton as "a certainty for a place as England's opening batsman. He is a marvel - the discovery of a generation ... His technique is that of a maestro."<ref name=H21>Howat, p.21.</ref> Sutcliffe was not one to give undue praise, but Hutton later said he found the comments a burden.<ref name=H21/><ref>Hill, p.169.</ref> In 1935, Hutton did not live up to these expectations. An operation on his nose before the season began delayed his appearance, but he returned to cricket too soon. After struggling for form and health, he collapsed while batting in a match. Yorkshire rested him for a month to enable him to recover; it was the end of July before he played regularly.<ref name=fcmatches>{{cite web| url = http://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Players/0/694/First-Class_Matches.html| title = First-Class Matches played by Len Hutton| publisher = CricketArchive| accessdate = 9 February 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| url = http://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/15/15418.html| title = Yorkshire v Warwickshire in 1935| publisher = CricketArchive| accessdate = 9 February 2010}}</ref><ref>Howat, p.22.</ref> His poor form left him with a total of 73 runs (average 10.43) by the middle of August, but a century against [[Middlesex County Cricket Club|Middlesex]] led him into a run of bigger scores. He finished with 577 runs at an average of 28.85 in first-class matches,<ref name=figures/><ref name=fcbatting/> helping Yorkshire to win the County Championship.<ref name=ccposn>{{Cite book| title = Wisden Cricketers' Almanack| edition = 2010| publisher = John Wisden & Co| chapter = LV County Championship: County Championship Final Positions 1890&ndash;2010| page = 575}}</ref>

In the winter of 1935&ndash;36, Hutton went on his first overseas tour as Yorkshire toured Jamaica.<ref name="Howat, p.23">Howat, p.23.</ref> In the season which followed, he reached 1,000 runs in a season for the first time, accumulating 1,282 runs at an average of 29.81, and was awarded his [[County cap]] by Yorkshire in July.<ref name=fcbatting/><ref>Howat, p.25.</ref> However, the level of expectation surrounding him led critics to regard this as no great achievement.<ref name=coy/> He took part several big partnerships through the season, including one of 230 with Sutcliffe, but endured a run of low scores in May and June.<ref name=H245>Howat, pp.24&ndash;25.</ref> Hutton received more criticism for his negative approach, but cricket writer Alan Hill believes Hutton needed to establish his defensive technique first in order to have his subsequently successful career.<ref name=H245/><ref>Hill, pp.170&ndash;71.</ref>

===Test match debut===
Hutton made a good start to the 1937 season, scoring 161 for Yorkshire against M.C.C. in the opening match, and was selected in a series of representative matches at [[Lord's Cricket Ground]] to celebrate the 150th anniversary of the [[Marylebone Cricket Club]] (M.C.C.). He scored 102 for the North against the South and 50 for The Rest of England against the M.C.C. team which had toured Australia the previous winter.<ref name=figures/><ref name=H27>Howat, p. 27.</ref> Hutton once again attracted notice from the national press; although described as a certainty to play for England very soon, critics described him as slightly dull and pedestrian.<ref>Howat, p. 28.</ref> Following more centuries for Yorkshire, Hutton was selected for the first Test against New Zealand.<ref>Howat, pp. 28&ndash;29.</ref> His good form continued after his selection was announced as he shared an opening partnership of 181 with Sutcliffe against [[Derbyshire County Cricket Club|Derbyshire]] and scored 271 [[not out]].<ref>{{cite web| url = http://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/16/16238.html| title = Yorkshire v Derbyshire in 1937| publisher = CricketArchive| accessdate = 28 April 2010}}</ref> In the next match, against [[Leicestershire County Cricket Club|Leicestershire]], he and Sutcliffe put on 315 for the first wicket, at one stage looking like they might threaten the record opening partnership of 555 which Sutcliffe had shared with Percy Holmes, until Hutton was out for 153.<ref>Howat, p. 29.</ref> However, on his first Test appearance, he scored a duck followed by one run in the second innings.<ref name=inns>{{cite web| url = http://stats.cricinfo.com/ci/engine/player/14334.html?class=1;template=results;type=batting;view=innings

Hutton began [[1938 English cricket season|1938]] with centuries against both Oxford and Cambridge Universities, 93 not out against Essex and a third century against [[Sussex County Cricket Club|Sussex]].<ref name=figures/> Selected for a Test trial, Hutton scored 40 in a century opening partnership with [[Bill Edrich]].<ref name=figures/><ref>Howat, pp. 32&ndash;33.</ref> Later in the season, Hutton scored his first fifty in the Players v Gentlemen match.<ref name=figures/> When the Test series against Australia began, Hutton made exactly 100 from 221 [[Delivery (cricket)|deliveries]], batting for over three hours on his first appearance in [[the Ashes]]. He shared an opening stand of 219 with [[Charlie Barnett (cricketer)|Charlie Barnett]], and England, in [[Wally Hammond]]'s first match as Test captain, posted a total of 658 for eight wickets.<ref>{{cite web| url = http://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/16/16611.html| title = England v Australia in 1938| publisher = CricketArchive| accessdate = 3 May 2010}}</ref> Several journalists, including the ''Wisden'' correspondent, ''The Times'' correspondent and Cardus, commented on his technical ability and judgement as he dealt with the Australian bowlers easily. He was noticeably more confident than he had been in the previous season.<ref>Howat, pp. 33&ndash;34.</ref> However, Hutton failed in the second Test with two single figure scores in another drawn game.<ref name=figures/> This failure was followed by a lean period; the third Test was rained off and after a run of low scores, his finger was broken in a match against Middlesex played on a dangerous pitch. Consequently, he missed the fourth Test which was played at Headingley and lost by England.<ref>Howat, pp. 34&ndash;35.</ref> After missing a month of cricket, Hutton played just two games before he was selected for the final Test.<ref name=figures/><ref>Howat, p. 35.</ref>

===Test record score===
In the final Test, Hammond won the toss on a pitch which was easy for batting and made it difficult to get wickets.<ref name=oval38/> He chose to bat, and although an early wicket fell, Hutton and [[Maurice Leyland]] took the score to 347 for one after the first day. Hutton was unbeaten on 160 although he should have been [[Stump (cricket)#Manner of dismissing a batsman|stumped]] when he had scored 40. Next day, the Yorkshire batsmen took their partnership to 382 before Leyland was out. Hutton then shared big partnerships with Hammond and [[Joe Hardstaff junior]] to be exactly 300 not out after the second day, out of a total of 634 for five. During the day's play, he had passed the highest Test score by an England batsman at home and abroad. Hutton maintained a cautious approach throughout, and ''Wisden'' commented that his dominance of the bowling had become slightly monotonous by this stage, although it recognised his skill.<ref name=oval38>{{cite web| url = http://www.cricinfo.com/wisdenalmanack/content/story/151853.html| title = England v Australia 1938| work = Wisden Cricketers' Almanack| year = 1939| publisher = John Wisden & Co. | accessdate = 3 May 2010}}</ref><ref name=oval38card>{{cite web| url = http://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/16/16792.html| title = England v Australia in 1938| publisher = CricketArchive| accessdate = 3 May 2010}}</ref> On the third day (23 August), the Australians made a determined effort to prevent him breaking the Ashes record score of 334 by Bradman, now the Australian captain. This total was seen as more prestigious to beat than the official Test match record score, Hammond's 336 not out against New Zealand, compiled against what was perceived as inferior bowling.<ref>{{cite book |last = Hilton  |first = Christopher  |title = Cricket's 300 Men and one 400 man  |publisher = Breedon Books  |year = 2005  |location= Derby  |pages=37&ndash;38}}</ref> After some nervous moments, Hutton passed Bradman's score with a cut off [[Chuck Fleetwood-Smith]], although his score took almost twice as long as Bradman's. Bradman was the first to congratulate him, followed by the rest of the Australians, and celebratory drinks were brought out.<ref name=oval38/><ref>Howat, p. 37.</ref> Hutton extended his score to 364, beating Hammond's record, before he was caught after batting for over thirteen hours while 770 runs were scored. The innings, which lasted over thirteen hours, was the longest innings in first-class cricket at the time. It was only the sixth Test of his career.<ref name=inns/><ref name=oval38/><ref name=oval38card/> England eventually reached the highest team total in Tests at the time, 903 for seven, before Hammond declared the innings closed. Australia, missing Bradman and [[Jack Fingleton]] through injury, were bowled out twice and England won by an innings and 579 runs to draw the series one all.<ref name=oval38card/>

Commentators mainly praised Hutton's concentration and stamina; his slow scoring, particularly when compared to Bradman's innings of 334, was excused on the grounds that the Oval match was being played without a time limit, removing the need for fast scoring and making run accumulation the only concern. Hutton was furthermore following his captain's instruction to bat as long as possible to make a huge score.<ref>Howat, pp. 39&ndash;40.</ref> Among Test cricketers, [[Les Ames]] believed that while Hutton had shown great skill, a combination of a very easy wicket for batting and a bowling attack which, [[Bill O'Reilly (cricketer)|Bill O'Reilly]] excepted, was unusually weak presented an ideal opportunity for such an innings. Former England captain [[Bob Wyatt]] described the innings as one of the greatest feats of concentration and endurance in the history of the game.<ref>Hill, pp. 177&ndash;78.</ref> In the aftermath of the innings, Hutton became famous. Receiving favourable attention from the press and becoming a celebrity, he was in demand from broadcasters and for public appearances. References were made to Sutcliffe's prediction from 1935, and comparisons were made to Bradman. Hutton later described the acclamation he received as one of the worst things that happened to him, not least because expectations were unreasonably high every time he batted.<ref>Howat, pp. 40&ndash;42.</ref> When the season ended, Hutton had scored 1,874 runs at an average of 60.45.<ref name=fcbatting/>

===Tour to South Africa===
In October 1938, Hutton toured South Africa with the M.C.C. under the captaincy of Hammond. He made a good start to the tour with centuries in two early matches, sharing large opening partnerships with Edrich. However, in a match against [[Gauteng cricket team|Transvaal]], a [[Delivery (cricket)|delivery]] from [[Eric Davies]] knocked him unconscious and forced him to miss the first Test.<ref name=H43>Howat, p. 43.</ref> Hutton failed on his return in the next Test, scored a double century in the following tour match, but had another low score in the third Test Nevertheless, England recorded a victory in this match, the only match in the series which did not end as a draw.<ref name=figures/><ref name=inns/> The final two Tests saw Hutton making bigger scores. In the fourth Test on a difficult pitch for batting, Hutton scored a cautious 92 to hold the England innings together and followed with 32 in the second innings.<ref name=inns/><ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.cricinfo.com/wisdenalmanack/content/story/151862.html| title = South Africa v England 1938-39| work = Wisden Cricketers' Almanack| year = 1940| publisher = John Wisden & Co. | accessdate = 6 May 2010}}</ref> The final Test saw a record aggregate and a draw after ten days of cricket in a supposedly "timeless" Test. Hutton scored 38 and 55 in the match but his contributions were overshadowed by the heavy scoring of others.<ref name=inns/><ref name="Howat, p. 44">Howat, p. 44.</ref> In the series, Hutton scored 265 runs at an average of 44.16.<ref name=tbat/> Critics perceived this as disappointing after his record innings. However, in all first-class matches, he scored 1,168 runs at an average of 64.88, the highest aggregate among the tourists, and accumulated five centuries. His batting proved attractive to spectators, and ''Wisden'' claimed that he looked the most accomplished batsman on the tour.<ref name=fcbatting/><ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.cricinfo.com/wisdenalmanack/content/story/155219.html| title = The M.C.C. team in South Africa 1938-39| work = Wisden Cricketers' Almanack| year = 1940| publisher = John Wisden & Co. | accessdate = 6 May 2010}}</ref>

In 1939, ''Wisden'' noted Hutton was developing into a stronger, more attractive batsman to watch. It claimed he showed signs of being one of the world's greatest batsmen.<ref name="Howat, p. 44"/> [[Ronnie Burnet]], who captained Yorkshire in the 1950s, remembered this as the season Hutton began to dominate opening partnerships with Sutcliffe, in contrast to prior seasons where he was junior partner.<ref>Hill, p. 174.</ref> Although he did not find his best form until the end of May, he scored 2,883 runs in the season, over 400 more runs than anyone else.

==Wartime career==
===Serious injury===
At the beginning of the war, Hutton volunteered for the army and was called up to the [[Army Physical Training Corps]], being quickly promoted to sergeant-instructor.<ref>Howat, p. 51.</ref> In 1940, he twice played cricket for Pudsey St Lawrence in the Bradford League, scoring 133 in one innings, played three matches at Headingley for Sutcliffe's XI in a charity match in aid of the Red Cross, and appeared at Lord's for [[Plum Warner|Pelham Warner]]'s XI.<ref name=figures/><ref>Howat, p. 52.</ref> His cricket was interrupted by a serious injury in March 1941 which threatened his career. On the last day of a commando training course in York, Hutton fell in the gymnasium when a mat slipped from under him. He suffered a fractured left forearm and dislocated the [[ulna]] at the wrist. Following surgery and rest, Hutton seemed to have recovered by the summer when he returned to his unit. He took part in a cricket match at Sheffield and scored a century, followed by further appearances in charity matches. However, he began to suffer increasing pain in his arm. Two further operations followed which attempted to graft bone from legs onto his injured arm; the first failed but a second at the end of 1941 eventually proved successful, after weeks of uncertainty and immobility for Hutton.<ref>Howat, pp. 53&ndash;54.</ref> He was discharged from the army and spent the summer of 1942 recovering before beginning to work as a civilian for the [[Corps of Royal Engineers|Royal Engineers]], inspecting properties for damage. However, the surgery left him with a left arm almost two inches shorter than the right.<ref>Howat, pp. 54&ndash;55.</ref>

===Return to cricket===
Hutton resumed professional cricket in the summer of 1943 as captain of Pudsey St Lawrence, one of many county players in the Bradford League during the war. Results went against Hutton's team, and the club committee were not happy with the performances. Hutton became disenchanted with captaincy, and following a disagreement with the club president, resigned in early June 1943. Hutton was third in the League batting averages and fifth in the bowling averages, while his team won the Priestley Cup.<ref>Howat, pp. 56&ndash;58.</ref> He continued to play for Pudsey in 1944, this time coming second in the Bradford League batting averages, and playing in a memorial match for Hedley Verity, who had been killed in the war the previous year.<ref name="Howat, p. 60">Howat, p. 60.</ref> At the same time, Hutton made his first appearance in representative matches at Lord's since 1940,<ref name=figures/> playing in two matches, making 34 and 84 in an attacking style.<ref>Howat, pp. 58&ndash;59.</ref> 

When the war ended in 1945, a programme of first-class matches was organised, involving counties and some other teams. A series of matches were played between England and an [[Australian Services cricket team]], called [[Victory Tests]] although they were not official Test matches.<ref name=H61>Howat, p. 61.</ref> Hutton was unsuccessful in the first match,<ref>{{cite web| url = http://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/17/17475.html| title = England v Australian Services in 1945|publisher = CricketArchive| accessdate = 17 May 2010}}</ref> but top-scored with 46 in the second innings of the second "Test". In the course of this innings, he encountered [[Keith Miller]] for the first time and was struck on the weak arm by a short ball, causing him great discomfort.<ref name=H61/> An appearance for Yorkshire against the Australian Services team produced a score of 81, while in the next Victory Test Hutton managed 104 and 69 before scoring another century for Yorkshire against the Australians.<ref>Howat, p. 62.</ref> In total, he scored 782 runs at an average of 48.87 in the nine first-class matches he played.<ref name=fcbatting/> Commentators were satisfied his batting technique remained effective and that he could still do well at the highest level.<ref name=obit>{{cite web| url = http://www.cricinfo.com/wisdenalmanack/content/story/155337.html| title = Len Hutton (Obituary)| work = Wisden Cricketers' Almanack| year = 1991| publisher = John Wisden & Co. | accessdate = 18 May 2010}}</ref> The showpiece match of the season was England against the Dominions at Lord's, but Hutton was prevented from appearing by his commitments to Pudsey, who had been reluctant to release him to play for other teams, given that they were paying him <U+00A3>100 for the season. In the event, these matches in 1945 were Hutton's last for Pudsey.<ref>Howat, p. 63.</ref>

==Career after the War==
===First tour to Australia===
[[File:Hutton 1947.jpg|right|thumb|350px|Len Hutton practising at Melbourne in 1946&ndash;47.|alt=A cricketer practising batting in front of a pavilion.]]
In 1946, first-class cricket fully resumed. Hutton scored 1,552 runs at an average of 48.50.<ref name=fcbatting/> His contributions helped Yorkshire to their fourth consecutive County Championship title, but while ''Wisden'' described him as the most effective Yorkshire batsman, his injured arm gave him some problems.<ref>{{Cite book| title = Wisden Cricketers' Almanack| edition = 1947| publisher = John Wisden & Co| chapter = Yorkshire in 1946| page = 486}}</ref> He could no longer fully rotate his wrists and from this point rarely used the [[hook shot]]. His four centuries included 183 not out against the touring Indian team,<ref name=H66>Howat, p. 66.</ref> but he was less successful in the three Tests, scoring 123 runs at an average of 30.75.<ref name=tbat/> England won the series 1&ndash;0 but Hutton's only fifty was a defensive innings in the second Test, when he was troubled by a bad back.<ref name=inns/><ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.cricinfo.com/wisdenalmanack/content/story/152869.html| title = England v India 1946| work = Wisden Cricketers' Almanack| year = 1947| publisher = John Wisden & Co. | accessdate = 22 May 2010}}</ref> Hutton was not selected for the Gentlemen and Players match, but was part of the M.C.C. team touring party for the winter.<ref name="Howat, p. 67">Howat, p. 67.</ref>

The team which toured Australia and New Zealand in 1946&ndash;47 was led by Walter Hammond, continuing his role as England captain. The M.C.C. had been reluctant to send a team so soon after the war, but the Australian authorities were insistent a tour should take place. The tourists were easily beaten in the Test series, finding Australia a much stronger team than had been expected. The English bowling was overwhelmed, and several batsmen failed to live up to expectations.<ref name=MCC46>{{cite web| url = http://www.cricinfo.com/wisdenalmanack/content/story/152882.html| title = M.C.C. team in Australia and New Zealand, 1946&ndash;47| work = Wisden Cricketers' Almanack| year = 1948| publisher = John Wisden & Co. | accessdate = 22 May 2010}}</ref> Hutton began the tour well, making good scores in the non first-class matches,<ref name=H68>Howat, p. 68.</ref> before facing the Australian State teams. He scored 136 against [[Southern Redbacks|South Australia]] followed in the next match by a confident 151 not out in difficult batting conditions against [[Victorian Bushrangers|Victoria]], described by ''Wisden'' as the best English innings of the tour.<ref name=figures/><ref name=MCC46/><ref>{{Cite book| title = Wisden Cricketers' Almanack| edition = 1948| publisher = John Wisden & Co| chapter = M.C.C. Team in Australia and New Zealand, 1946&ndash;47| page = 724}}</ref> His next three innings yielded scores of 71, 97 and 42.<ref name=figures/> His form drew compliments from former Australian players and the press, with one report in the ''Brisbane Telegraph'' describing him as the best batsman in the world.<ref name=H68/>

Hutton could not reproduce this form in the early Test matches; he scored seven and a first ball [[Duck (cricket)|duck]] in the first Test.<ref name=inns/> In the second Test, he was struck on his injured arm by an early short ball from Keith Miller, in a first innings score of 39. In the second innings, he made only 37 runs but received praise for his play, frequently [[Drive (cricket)|driving]] the bowling of Miller and [[Fred Freer]] before the bat slipped from his hand and hit the wicket, ending the innings.<ref>Howat, pp. 69&ndash;70.</ref><ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.cricinfo.com/wisdenalmanack/content/story/152884.html| title = England v Australia 1946&ndash;47 (Second Test)| work = Wisden Cricketers' Almanack| year = 1948| publisher = John Wisden & Co. | accessdate = 23 May 2010}}</ref> England had been defeated in the opening two Tests by an innings but managed to draw the third, although Hutton again did not reach fifty.<ref name=inns/> In the second innings, Hutton batted three hours for 40 runs, withstanding a series of short pitched balls from [[Ray Lindwall]] and Miller, but was caught from one of the few attacking shots he played.<ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.cricinfo.com/wisdenalmanack/content/story/152885.html| title = England v Australia 1946&ndash;47 (Third Test)| work = Wisden Cricketers' Almanack| year = 1948| publisher = John Wisden & Co. | accessdate = 24 May 2010}}</ref> After this, Hutton put together a sequence of high scores in the Tests, sharing three consecutive century opening partnerships with Washbrook in the process.<ref name=MCC46/> England drew the fourth match; Hutton contributed a four hour 94 in the first innings and 76 in the second.<ref name=inns/> Press opinion was divided over Hutton's performance in the fourth Test; although some critics considered he had established a superiority over the bowling, others believed he was insecure against fast bowling and had not lived up to expectations.<ref name=H71>Howat, p. 71.</ref> The Australian bowlers believed Hutton showed weakness against short bowling and bowled a high proportion of bouncers at him. Hutton's response, particularly in the first innings, was to duck under the ball to avoid giving catches, but this caused speculation that Hutton was afraid. In response to this criticism, Hutton produced a more attacking display in his second innings 76, despite a series of bouncers from Lindwall and Miller.<ref name=H71/><ref name=Jenkins>{{cite web| last = Jenkins | first = V.

The tourists arrived at Sydney for the final part of the tour, playing [[New South Wales Blues|New South Wales]] for the second time. Hutton was struck on the chin, deflecting a short ball onto his chin while attempting a hook shot, necessitating a visit to a hospital for an X-ray and stitches. However, he was able to resume his innings and later score 72 in the second innings.<ref>{{cite web| url = http://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/17/17967.html| title = New South Wales v Marylebone Cricket Club in 1946/47 |publisher = CricketArchive| accessdate = 27 May 2010}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book| title = Wisden Cricketers' Almanack| edition = 1948| publisher = John Wisden & Co| chapter = M.C.C.

The ''Sydney Morning Herald'' criticised the high number of short balls bowled by the Australian pacemen, many bowled at Hutton and as often as two or three times per [[Over (cricket)|over]].<ref name=H72>Howat, p. 72.</ref> However, after the second day was rained off, Hutton was taken ill overnight with tonsilitis. Taken to hospital, he missed the remainder of the match and had to fly home soon after. ''Wisden'' believed that Hutton's absence from the second innings was a severe handicap to England, who went on to lose the match.<ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.cricinfo.com/wisdenalmanack/content/story/152887.html| title = England v Australia 1946&ndash;47 (Fifth Test)| work = Wisden Cricketers' Almanack| year = 1948| publisher = John Wisden & Co. | accessdate = 25 May 2010}}</ref> In all first-class matches on tour, Hutton scored 1,267 runs at an average of 70.38, while in the Tests, he managed 417 runs at an average of 52.12, placing Hutton top of both sets of averages.<ref name=fcbatting/><ref name=tbat/><ref name=H72/> ''Wisden'' noted that it took him time to find form in the Tests, but that he often batted well despite ill health.<ref name=MCC46/> Bill Bowes, covering the tour as a journalist, believed that Hutton was unable to master bowling faster than he had encountered for eight years, but acquitted himself reasonably well.<ref>Bowes, p. 187.</ref>

===Series against South Africa and West Indies===
Hutton had his tonsils removed before the start of the 1947 season but continued to experience poor health and missed some early games in the new season, although his form remained good with four centuries in early matches.<ref>Howat, pp. 72&ndash;73</ref> Yorkshire dropped to equal seventh in the County Championship, mainly through the absence of Hutton playing representative cricket and the retirement of several long-serving players after the previous season.<ref name=ccposn/><ref>Howat, pp. 73&ndash;74.</ref> In the Test matches Hutton made a poor start and did not achieve his usual standards.

After 16 months of continuous cricket, Hutton initially was rested at his own request from the 1947&ndash;48 winter M.C.C. tour of the West Indies. However, when injuries severely affected the team, the touring captain [[Gubby Allen]] asked the M.C.C. to send out more players. Subsequently, Hutton was asked to fly out to join the tour.<ref>Howat, pp. 74&ndash;75.</ref><ref name=mcc47/48>{{cite web| url = http://www.cricinfo.com/wisdenalmanack/content/story/152899.html| title = M.C.C. in West Indies, 1947&ndash;48| work = Wisden Cricketers' Almanack| year = 1949| publisher = John Wisden & Co. | accessdate = 31 May 2010}}</ref> After travelling for four days, Hutton arrived and played immediately against British Guiana, scoring 138 and 62 not out.<ref name=figures/><ref name=h75>Howat, p. 75.</ref> before appearing in the third Test where he scored 31 and 24.<ref name=inns/> After a century against Jamaica,<ref name=figures/> Hutton played innings of 56 and 60 in the fourth and final Test, giving him 171 runs at an average of 42.75 in the series.<ref name=inns/><ref name=tbat/> He came top of the first-class averages for the tourists, with 578 runs at an average of 64.22, and was judged by ''Wisden'' to be the only batsman other than Joe Hardstaff to produce his best form. However, the tourists lost the four Test series 2&ndash;0 and their failure to win a single match was regarded as damaging to the prestige of English cricket.<ref name=fcbatting/><ref name=mcc47/48/>

===Struggles against pace===
During the [[1948 English cricket season|1948 season]], Hutton scored heavily for Yorkshire. He scored most runs and had the highest batting average of anyone in the team, despite missing more than half of the County Championship matches.<ref>{{cite web| url = http://cricketarchive.com/Yorkshire/Seasons/Seasonal_Averages/1948_f_Batting_by_Average.html| title = First-class Batting and Fielding for Yorkshire in 1948| publisher = CricketArchive| accessdate = 8 June 2010}}</ref> In county matches, Hutton had an average of 92.05 and scored eight centuries. Some Yorkshire critics were concerned by the team's dependence on Hutton and the poor performance of other batsmen.<ref>Howat, p. 76.</ref> Hutton's main challenge was against the [[Australian cricket team in England in 1948|touring Australian side]] which toured England without being defeated. In the early part of the tour, the Australians, and particularly the bowlers Lindwall and Miller, tried to shake his confidence by targeting his batting.<ref name=H77>Howat, p. 77.</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Perry|first=Roland|authorlink=Roland Perry|title=Miller's Luck: the life and loves of Keith Miller, Australia's greatest all-rounder|year=2005|publisher=Random House|location=Sydney|isbn=9781741662221|location=Milsons Point, New South Wales|page=229}}</ref> Gerald Howat, Hutton's biographer, notes a combination of his arm injury and a pace attack unlike anything he had encountered brought uncertainty to Hutton's batting in 1948.<ref name=H79/> In their first encounter, the tour match against Yorkshire, a difficult pitch led to a low scoring game in which the [[Spin bowling|spin bowlers]] did most of the damage; Hutton failed in both innings.<ref name=figures/><ref>Fingleton, p. 55.</ref> Hutton next played against the Australians for the M.C.C. at Lord's. The team contained many leading players but the batting failed against the Australian bowling.

Hutton was selected in the first Test, but England were overwhelmed as the Australian fast bowlers dominated the home batsmen.<ref name=1st48>{{cite web| url = http://www.cricinfo.com/wisdenalmanack/content/story/152894.html| title = England v Australia 1948 (First Test)| work = Wisden Cricketers' Almanack| year = 1949| publisher = John Wisden & Co. | accessdate = 10 June 2010}}</ref> Hutton scored only three runs in the first innings, bowled by a fast ball from Miller after leaving a gap between his bat and pad.<ref name=inns/><ref name=1st48/><ref>O'Reilly, p. 32.</ref> More successful in the second innings, Hutton scored 74 and established a brief period of dominance over Miller, taking three fours in quick succession off the Australian bowler. Miller subsequently bowled a series of bouncers, one of which struck Hutton on the shoulder and provoked an angry reaction from the crowd. Hutton followed up with another four, and remained not out at the end of the day's play, but Miller bowled him next morning in very poor light. Former Australian player [[Jack Fingleton]], working as a journalist, criticised Hutton for trying to play [[Cricket terminology#F|front foot shots]] in the match rather than [[Cricket terminology#B|back foot shots]].<ref name=inns/><ref name=1st48/><ref>Fingleton, pp. 82&ndash;83, 95&ndash;97.</ref> In the second Test, also lost by England, Hutton scored 20 and 13,<ref name=inns/> but of more concern to critics was the manner in which he batted.

Hutton missed the ball completely several times while facing Lindwall, and Fingleton described it as Hutton's worst effort in a Test, although he did concede it may have been hard to see the ball in the poor light.<ref name=F117>Fingleton, p. 117.</ref> Hutton played loosely outside the off stump and missed the ball four times in one Johnston over.<ref name=O74/> O'Reilly said that Hutton "seemed to have lost all power of concentration and looked like a man being led to the gallows", and that he "was little more than a masquerader compared to the Hutton [of 1938]."<ref name=O74>O'Reilly, p. 74.</ref> He was finally out for 13, and in Fingleton's words, "returned to the pavilion in cold silence. The chopper was about to fall for him and the silence, presaging it, indicated the general disapproval of Lord's at his showing."<ref name=F117/>

Hutton was left out of the side for the third Test, to much controversy and debate. Observers had noticed Hutton backing away from the fast bowlers.

Recalled to the team for the fourth Test at Headingley, Hutton scored 81 and 57.

===Leading batsman===
Hutton toured South Africa in the winter of 1948&ndash;49 with the M.C.C. under the captaincy of [[George Mann (cricketer)|George Mann]].

For the [[1950-51 Ashes series|M.C.C. tour of Australia in 1950&ndash;51]], 39 year old [[Freddie Brown (cricketer)|Freddie Brown]] was the surprising choice of captain, after an attacking innings of 122 in the Gentlemen v Players match of 1950.<ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.cricinfo.com/wisdenalmanack/content/story/152944.html| title = F.

Consequently, the professional Denis Compton was appointed as vice-captain for the tour.<ref>Gibson, pp. 179&ndash;81.</ref><ref>Howat, pp. 91&ndash;92.</ref> When the tour began, Hutton initially struggled with the finger injury he sustained against West Indies after it was damaged further while playing in Ceylon during a stop-over on the boat journey. Hutton was out of cricket for a month, but quickly found his batting form on his return, scoring a century against New South Wales.<ref>Howat, pp. 92&ndash;93.</ref> Hoping to strengthen a fragile batting line up, the tour selectors decided Hutton would bat in the [[Batting order (cricket)#Middle order|middle order]] rather than taking his accustomed position as opener.

==Captain of England==
===Appointment===
Brown resigned from the captaincy of England at the end of 1951, leaving the selectors with a problem. None of the amateur county captains were considered to of sufficient ability to represent England in a Test, and most lacked the experience to be captain. Once again, the possibility of a professional captain was raised, although Norman Yardley remained in the frame.<ref name="Gibson, p. 184">Gibson, p. 184.</ref> However, in an appointment anticipated by the press, the selectors chose Hutton, who became the first professional cricketer in the 20th century to captain England in a Test match, and the first to do so in England. Hutton had already expressed his willingness to do the job but stated he would not become an amateur to do so, and harboured private doubts about whether the cricket establishment and M.C.C. members would receive him.<ref>Howat, pp. 105&ndash;07.</ref> The decision met with broad approval from the press, and the editor of ''Wisden'' wrote: "In breaking with tradition and choosing a professional as captain the Selection Committee made a vital decision in the interests of England, because it should mean that in future no man will be picked as leader unless he is worth a place in the side."<ref name=ed53>{{cite web| last = Preston | first = Norman |url = http://www.cricinfo.com/wisdenalmanack/content/story/152967.html| title = Notes by the Editor| work = Wisden Cricketers' Almanack| year = 1953| publisher = John Wisden & Co. | accessdate = 20 July 2010}}</ref><ref>Howat, p. 106.</ref>

===Ashes victory===
At the start of the [[1953 English cricket season|1953 season]], England faced a Test series against Australia, who had held the Ashes since 1934. Critics considered England to have a good chance of regaining the Ashes, but Australia remained confident, particularly after winning six of their first eight tour games by an innings.<ref name=ed53/><ref>Howat, p. 112.</ref> Hutton was appointed captain, once again on a match-by-match basis.<ref name=H114>Howat, p. 114.</ref> Once the Tests started, he began well with scores of 43 and 60 not out in the drawn first Test,<ref name=inns/> top-scoring in both innings despite doubts over his fitness. However, England's dismissal for just 144 in their first innings made him doubtful about England's prospects for the series.<ref>Howat, pp. 112&ndash;13.</ref> Before the second Test, Hutton scored two fifties against the Australians for Yorkshire, but his fitness was again doubtful before the Test, this time with [[Fibromyalgia|fibrositis]]. His movement was restricted while fielding, and he dropped three catches in Australia's first innings, injuring his thumb in the process.<ref>Howat, p. 113.</ref><ref name=2ndTest53>{{cite web |url = http://www.cricinfo.com/wisdenalmanack/content/story/152565.html| title = England v Australia 1953 (Second Test)| work = Wisden Cricketers' Almanack| year = 1954| publisher = John Wisden & Co. | accessdate = 21 July 2010}}</ref> Despite these problems, Hutton scored 145 in England's first innings, batting with great freedom.<ref name=2ndTest53/> However, in the second innings, Hutton was dismissed early and it took a long stand between [[Willie Watson (England cricketer)|Willie Watson]] and [[Trevor Bailey]] to allow England to escape with a draw after a batting collapse.<ref name=2ndTest53/> By now, the press were criticising Hutton's tactics and cautious approach,<ref name=H114/> and he faced more fitness concerns going into the third Test. Rain prevented a result and Hutton scored 66, but he earned more praise for putting Australia under pressure in their second innings to establish a psychological advantage when a result was impossible. The visiting batsmen struggled to play the English spinners and now it was the Australian team who came under pressure from the press. In contrast, Hutton was appointed captain for the rest of the series, as well as for the forthcoming M.C.C. winter tour of West Indies.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.cricinfo.com/wisdenalmanack/content/story/152566.html| title = England v Australia 1953 (Third Test)| work = Wisden Cricketers' Almanack| year = 1954| publisher = John Wisden & Co. | accessdate = 24 July 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url = http://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/20/20744.html| title = England v Australia in 1953 (Third Test)| publisher = CricketArchive | accessdate = 24 July 2010}}</ref><ref>Howat, p. 115.</ref>

The fourth Test, in front of Hutton's home crowd, was Hutton's least successful of the series. Having been put into bat by Hassett, Hutton was bowled second ball by a [[yorker]] from Lindwall. England never recovered, and Australia led by 99 as England began their second innings with three days left. Hutton scored only 25 but England batted for a long time, assisted by rain, leaving Australia 177 in 115 minutes to win the game. The tourists were winning easily when Hutton asked Bailey to use the negative tactic of [[leg theory]], bowling wide of [[Stump (cricket)|leg stump]] to make run scoring difficult, while using a long run-up to waste time. Only twelve overs were bowled in the last 45 minutes, and the tactics resulted in Australia being 30 short of their target when the game ended.<ref name=inns/><ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.cricinfo.com/wisdenalmanack/content/story/152567.html| title = England v Australia 1953 (Fourth Test)| work = Wisden Cricketers' Almanack| year = 1954| publisher = John Wisden & Co. | accessdate = 24 July 2010}}</ref> Hutton was criticised for negativity by the Australian press, but Bill Bowes wrote that the gravity of the situation justified Hutton's tactics.<ref>Howat, p. 117.</ref> The deciding Test began amid great interest from the public. Hutton lost his fifth successive toss in the series but Hutton used Fred Trueman, in his first match of the series, in short bursts to take four wickets in Australia's first innings of 275. Surviving an early scare when a bouncer from Lindwall nearly knocked his cap onto his wickets, Hutton scored 82, but England only managed a narrow first innings lead.<ref name=5T53>{{cite web |url = http://www.cricinfo.com/wisdenalmanack/content/story/152568.html| title = England v Australia 1953 (Fifth Test)| work = Wisden Cricketers' Almanack| year = 1954| publisher = John Wisden & Co. | accessdate = 27 July 2010}}</ref> In their reply, Australia collapsed before the England spinners, for which ''Wisden'' gave the credit to Hutton, both for realising that the pitch favoured spin and for some of his tactical decisions. Although Hutton was run out early in England's pursuit of 132 to win the Ashes, the remaining batsmen took England to their first series win against Australia since 1932&ndash;33 and their first home series win since 1926.<ref name=5T53/> Hutton was widely acclaimed after the series, particularly for the good spirit which he and Hassett maintained.<ref>Howat, p. 121.</ref> In the series, he scored 443 runs at an average of 55.37.<ref name=tbat/> Hutton ended the summer with another century against the Australians at the Scarborough Festival. However, he had felt the strain of leading England that summer, and some at Yorkshire felt he relaxed too much to improve discipline at the county, despite his batting successes.<ref>Howat, pp. 120&ndash;21.</ref> In the whole summer, he scored 2,458 runs at an average of 63.02.<ref name=fcbatting/>

===Captain in the West Indies===
In the following winter of 1953&ndash;54, Hutton led the M.C.C. on a controversial tour of West Indies, becoming the first professional captain of England on a tour in the twentieth century.<ref name=H126>Howat, p. 126.</ref> Before the tour began, Hutton encountered problems. His appointment was queried by critics who believed a professional captain would be unsuitable to lead a tour.<ref name="Gibson, p. 184"/> Furthermore, the M.C.C. refused to appoint the manager Hutton requested, instead appointing [[Charles Palmer (cricketer)|Charles Palmer]], the captain of Leicestershire. Palmer possessed neither the experience nor temperament for the job and authority on the tour was muddled by having a manager who had to play under the captain's authority.<ref>Gibson, pp. 185&ndash;86.</ref><ref>Howat, pp. 140&ndash;41.</ref><ref name=Sw148>Swanton, p. 148.</ref> Hutton also struggled to lead some of the senior professionals, feeling uncomfortable giving orders to fellow professionals, particularly as some, such as [[Godfrey Evans]], were unco-operative at first,<ref>Gibson, p. 186.</ref> and he found Trueman difficult to handle.<ref name=H140>Howat, p. 140.</ref>

Off field events often overshadowed the cricket. The tour took place when there were growing independence movements in the region, causing friction. Hutton believed his team was used as a political instrument to support colonial rule.<ref>Howat, pp. 125&ndash;26.</ref> Tension was increased by the perception among journalists that the series would establish the unofficial world champions of cricket, while ''Wisden's'' correspondent noted that the situation was made worse by "the constant emphasis upon victory which the M.C.C. players found to be stressed by English residents in the West Indies."<ref name=WI53>{{cite web |url = http://www.cricinfo.com/wisdenalmanack/content/story/155235.html| title = The M.C.C. team in the West Indies, 1953&ndash;54| work = Wisden Cricketers' Almanack| year = 1955| publisher = John Wisden & Co. | accessdate = 29 July 2010}}</ref> Umpiring was a further source of controversy as the tourists believed standards were low and Hutton made a protest to the West Indies board.<ref name=WI53/> In several matches, the crowds made noisy protests about events on the field, often related to umpiring decisions. The climax came in the third Test where bottles and other missiles were thrown onto the outfield when the umpire said [[Cliff McWatt]] was out. Hutton managed to keep his side and the umpires on the field, possibly defusing a dangerous situation.<ref name=G185>Gibson, p. 185.</ref><ref name="Howat, p. 131">Howat, p. 131.</ref> There were other incidents when England players were accused of showing a lack of courtesy,<ref>Howat, pp. 129, 137&ndash;38.</ref> while the openly negative reactions of English players to on-field events further inflamed feelings.<ref name=WI53/><ref name=G185/> Some critics held Hutton responsible for the perceived lack of sportsmanship by the M.C.C. players, as they felt he should have brought Trueman and other younger tourists under closer control.<ref name=WI53/><ref>Howat, pp. 129&ndash;30, 140.</ref> However, the editor of ''Wisden'' later wrote: "[Hutton] was involved in the most thankless task any cricket captain has undertaken when he went to West Indies. Instead of finding a friendly cricket atmosphere he and his players were subjected to the impact of deep political and racial feeling&mdash;an experience all of them wish to forget. A few members of the team did not hide their innermost feelings, with the result that Hutton came under severe criticism, although his behaviour was blameless."<ref name=Ed55>{{cite web | last = Preston | first = Norman | url = http://www.cricinfo.com/wisdenalmanack/content/story/150218.html| title = Notes by the Editor | work = Wisden Cricketers' Almanack| year = 1955| publisher = John Wisden & Co. | accessdate = 4 August 2010}}</ref>

The tour began quietly in the warm-up games.<ref name=H126/> As the Test series began, Hutton wanted to exploit what he saw as a West Indian weakness against pace which had been exploited by Australia in 1951&ndash;52; he picked four fast bowlers but had misjudged the pitch and it played very slowly. West Indies were able to build up a big score. England collapsed to the West Indies spinners and, set a target of 457 to win, the England batsmen failed for the second time despite 57 runs from Hutton, and the tourists lost by 140 runs. Both captains employed time-wasting tactics in the match, and used negative [[leg theory]] bowling, outside [[Stump (cricket)|leg stump]].<ref name=WIT1>{{cite web |url = http://www.cricinfo.com/wisdenalmanack/content/story/152582.html| title = West Indies v England 1953&ndash;54 (First Test)| work = Wisden Cricketers' Almanack| year = 1955| publisher = John Wisden & Co. | accessdate = 30 July 2010}}</ref><ref>Howat, p. 127.</ref> In the second Test, he scored 72 and 77 but could not prevent another defeat after losing his seventh consecutive toss in Tests and despite the loss of early wickets, West Indies scored 383. England batted very slowly; Hutton took four-and-a-half hours over his first innings and was barracked by the crowd.<ref name=figures/><ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.cricinfo.com/wisdenalmanack/content/story/152583.html| title = West Indies v England 1953&ndash;54 (Second Test)| work = Wisden Cricketers' Almanack| year = 1955| publisher = John Wisden & Co. | accessdate = 30 July 2010}}</ref> England won the third Test by nine wickets, their first victory in the Caribbean since 1935. Hutton, who won the toss for the first time in eight matches, scored 169 in seven hours, concentrating on defence and England's bowlers bowled out West Indies twice.<ref name=inns/><ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.cricinfo.com/wisdenalmanack/content/story/152584.html| title = West Indies v England 1953&ndash;54 (Third Test)| work = Wisden Cricketers' Almanack| year = 1955| publisher = John Wisden & Co. | accessdate = 4 August 2010}}</ref> As the fourth Test was drawn in very easy batting conditions, England had to win the final Test to draw the series. Hutton lost the toss but Trevor Bailey produced his best bowling figures in Tests to bowl out West Indies cheaply in good batting conditions. Hutton then batted for almost nine hours to score 205, his nineteenth and final Test century. Previously, no England captain had scored a double century while on tour. ''Wisden'' observed that "For concentration and control, Hutton's innings ... scarcely could have been excelled."<ref name=inns/><ref name=WIT5>{{cite web |url = http://www.cricinfo.com/wisdenalmanack/content/story/152586.html| title = West Indies v England 1953&ndash;54 (Fifth Test)| work = Wisden Cricketers' Almanack| year = 1955| publisher = John Wisden & Co. | accessdate = 4 August 2010}}</ref> England's bowlers bowled out West Indies a second time and England scored the required runs to record a series-levelling nine-wicket victory, West Indies' first defeat in Jamaica in a Test.<ref name=WIT5/>

''Wisden's'' verdict on Hutton's series was that he showed mastery of every bowler and stood apart from everyone else. He also displayed some excellent attacking shots. The correspondent wrote, "From first to last no batsman compared with Hutton ... Considering the weight of his many responsibilities and worries, Hutton played magnificent cricket..."<ref name=WI53/> The press were generally supportive with a few reservations about his caution.<ref>Howat, pp. 142&ndash;44.</ref> Swanton and Alan Gibson later credited England's recovery to Hutton.<Sw148/><ref>Gibson, pp. 184&ndash;85.</ref> In five Tests, he scored 677 runs, his highest in a series, at an average of 96.71, the highest on either side.<ref name=tbat/><ref name=WI53/>  In all first-class matches, he made 780 runs at an average of 78.00.<ref name=fcbatting/>

===Appointment of Shepherd===
Hutton's health was uncertain and he missed large parts of the 1954 season on medical advice, suffering from mental and physical exhaustion caused by the West Indian tour.<ref name=Sw148/><ref name=H146>Howat, pp. 146&ndash;48.</ref> Although he played in the drawn first Test, Pakistan's inaugral match, scoring a duck, he did not play in the next two games. In his place, the selectors appointed the amateur [[David Sheppard]] as England captain, and he won the second and third Tests without batting particularly successfully.<ref name=H146/> [[Walter Robins]], a selector and former England captain, and [[Errol Holmes]], a former skipper of Surrey, believed Shepherd should captain the forthcoming M.C.C. tour to Australia, and pressured him into putting his name forward as a candidate. Shepherd, a theology student at the time, indicated he would accept the post and take a leave of absence from his studies if required.<ref name=H146/><ref name=G186>Gibson, pp. 186&ndash;87.</ref> According to ''Wisden'' editor [[Norman Preston]], these events were caused by reservations about Hutton's captaincy among influential people "behind the scenes".<ref name=Ed55/> Speculation grew in the press that Hutton would surrender the captaincy in Shepherd's favour, and journalists wanted to know Shepherd's intentions.<ref name=H146/> However, most newspapers favoured Hutton and ran stories which detailed a perceived prejuduce among M.C.C. members against professional cricketers. Neither Hutton nor Shepherd publucly expressed an opinion, although Hutton informed the M.C.C. he would tour Australia as captain or player as required, and both men remained on good personal terms throughout.<ref name=G186/> Robins, seeing the strength of opinion on the matter, backed down. As Hutton returned to cricket in July, scoring two centuries, he was appointed captain of the M.C.C. for the winter tour.{{#tag:ref|''Wisden'' claimed in 1955 that the selectors only chose Hutton by a margin of one vote. This was retracted the following year, when it reported the M.C.C. had informed them the vote was unanimous.<ref name=Ed55/><ref>{{cite web | last = Preston | first = Norman | url = http://www.cricinfo.com/wisdenalmanack/content/story/152594.html| title = Notes by the Editor | work = Wisden Cricketers' Almanack| year = 1956| publisher = John Wisden & Co. | accessdate = 4 August 2010}}</ref>|group=notes}} Returning to captain a slightly weakened England side for the fourth and final Test, Hutton failed with the bat, and Pakistan recorded their first Test victory.<ref name=G186/><ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.cricinfo.com/wisdenalmanack/content/story/153886.html| title = England v Pakistan 1954 | work = Wisden Cricketers' Almanack| year = 1956| publisher = John Wisden & Co. | accessdate = 4 August 2010}}</ref> In his three Test innings of the season, Hutton scored just 19 runs.<ref name=inns/> Owing to his reduced appearances, Hutton failed to reach 1,000 first-class runs for the first time since 1936, reaching 912 runs at an average of 35.07.<ref name=fcbatting/>

===Captain in Australia===
{{Main|English cricket team in Australia in 1954<U+2013>55}}

Expectations before the [[1954-55 Ashes series|Australian tour]] were not high following the confusion over captaincy and England's performances against Pakistan. In addition, the selectors, of whom Hutton was one following his appointment, made some controversial choices, omitting Trueman, [[Jim Laker]] and [[Tony Lock]] who had been part of the winning England team in 1953, while including [[Colin Cowdrey]], who had not been in good form in 1954, and [[Vic Wilson (cricketer)|Vic Wilson]] as cover to Compton, whose fitness was in question. Hutton had emphasised the need to include pace bowlers for the tour.<ref name=Wis55>{{cite web | url = http://www.cricinfo.com/wisdenalmanack/content/story/152600.html| title = M.C.C. in Australia and New Zealand, 1954&ndash;55| work = Wisden Cricketers' Almanack| year = 1956| publisher = John Wisden & Co. | accessdate = 5 August 2010}}</ref><ref>Howat, pp. 148&ndash;50.</ref><ref>Gibson, p. 187.</ref> The tourists had some success in their first tour games, winning three matches and drawing two. Hutton played in every other game, resting in between, but made scores of 37, 98, 102 and 87.<ref name=Wis55/><ref>Howat, p. 152.</ref> Hutton went into the first Test with no spinner and chose to bowl on winning the toss. It was the first time an England captain had done so in Australia since [[Johnny Douglas]] in 1911-12, but the fifth time the team had done so on tour. Missing Godfrey Evans and losing Compton to injury during the game, England dropped twelve catches as Australia scored 601 for eight. The tourists were bowled out for 190 and 257 to lose by an innings, Hutton scored four and 15, and his decision to bowl was regarded as a mistake.<ref name=figures/><ref name=1T55>{{cite web | url = http://www.cricinfo.com/wisdenalmanack/content/story/152601.html| title = Hutton's gamble backfires| work = Wisden Cricketers' Almanack| year = 1956| publisher = John Wisden & Co. | accessdate = 7 August 2010}}</ref><ref>Howat, p. 153.</ref> Despite the result, Hutton increasingly saw potential in Tyson's bowling, arranging for [[Alf Gover]], in Australia as a journalist but usually a respected coach, to improve and shorten Tyson's run to the wicket.<ref>Howat, p. 154.</ref>

Hutton opted for a more balanced bowling attack in the second Test, leaving out the unfit Alec Bedser, England's most reliable bowler since the war, to include the spinners [[Bob Appleyard]] and [[Johnny Wardle]].<ref name=Wis55/><ref>Howat, p. 155.</ref> Hutton lost the toss, had to bat first and England collapsed to 154 in their first innings.<ref name=Wis55/> Hutton batted over two hours for 30 in this innings and scored 28 in the second.<ref name=inns/> However, in a low scoring match, Tyson proved to be the crucial factor and he bowled England to a 38 run win.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.cricinfo.com/wisdenalmanack/content/story/152602.html| title = England v Australia 1954&ndash;55 (second Test) | work = Wisden Cricketers' Almanack| year = 1956| publisher = John Wisden & Co. | accessdate = 8 August 2010}}</ref> After a break for Christmas, Hutton was unwell at the start of the third match in the series, suffering from fibrositis and a heavy cold. After deciding to play at the last minute, he unexpectedly left out Bedser from the side again, although he was fit to play. Hutton did not inform Bedser that he would not play before the match, and the bowler only learned of his fate when he saw the team list displayed in the dressing room before the match.<ref>Howat, pp. 156&ndash;57.</ref> Hutton scored 12 and 42, with the latter innings particularly valuable at a difficult time in the match. However, [[Peter May]] and [[Colin Cowdrey]] made large scores and Tyson took seven wickets as Australia were bowled out for 111 in their second innings, giving England a 128 run victory.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/21/21392.html| title = Australia v England in 1954/55 (third Test)| publisher = CricketArchive | accessdate = 8 August 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.cricinfo.com/wisdenalmanack/content/story/152603.html| title = England v Australia 1954&ndash;55 (third Test) | work = Wisden Cricketers' Almanack| year = 1956| publisher = John Wisden & Co. | accessdate = 8 August 2010}}</ref>

In the important fourth Test, Hutton lost the toss and England bowled Australia out for 323. In England's reply, Hutton made 80 of England's 341, his only fifty in the series and the highest score of the match, in four and a half hours.<ref name=4Tsc>{{cite web | url = http://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/21/21427.html| title = Australia v England in 1954/55 (fourth Test)| publisher = CricketArchive | accessdate = 11 August 2010}}</ref> ''Wisden'' regarded Hutton's tactical use of his bowlers as crucial in giving his team the upper hand and Australia were all out for 111,<ref name=4T55>{{cite web | url = http://www.cricinfo.com/wisdenalmanack/content/story/152604.html| title = England v Australia 1954&ndash;55 (fourth Test) | work = Wisden Cricketers' Almanack| year = 1956| publisher = John Wisden & Co. | accessdate = 11 August 2010}}</ref> leaving England needing 94 to win. Early wickets fell to Miller, including Hutton,<ref name=4Tsc/> and when the captain returned to the dressing room, he said that Miller had "done us again." Compton, the next man in, replied "I haven't been in yet", and stayed at the wicket until the match was won by five wickets. Many commentators viewed this as a sign that Hutton's reserve had slipped in the critical situation, but Alan Gibson believes it was a deliberate ploy to inspire Compton.<ref>Gibson, p. 88.</ref> England had retained the Ashes, and went on to draw the final Test in a match ruined by rain. Hutton was out to the fourth ball of the match, but Australia were forced to follow on for the first time by England since 1938, and Hutton took a wicket with the last ball of the match before time ran out.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.cricinfo.com/wisdenalmanack/content/story/152605.html| title = England v Australia 1954&ndash;55 (fifth Test) | work = Wisden Cricketers' Almanack| year = 1956| publisher = John Wisden & Co. | accessdate = 11 August 2010}}</ref> This ended the series, which England won 3&ndash;1.<ref name=Wis55/> 

Hutton's tactical approach in the series was praised by Australian and English commentators; they noted how Hutton observed his opponents very carefully, leading to an ability to spot weaknesses. His caution was criticised, but journalists' main complaint was the tactic of slowing down the speed at which overs were bowled, giving his fast bowlers more time to rest and slowing down the scoring rate. Australian commentators also detected technical faults in his batting.<ref>Howat, pp. 162&ndash;64.</ref> With the bat, Hutton scored 220 runs in Tests at an average of 24.44. In all first-class matches in Australia, he scored 959 runs at 50.47.<ref name=fcbatting/><ref name=tbat/>

The tour ended with two Tests in New Zealand; England won the first by eight wickets.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/21/21451.html| title = New Zealand v England in 1954/55 (first Test)| publisher = CricketArchive | accessdate = 11 August 2010}}</ref> The tourists won the second by an innings and 20 runs.

===Retirement===
On Hutton's return to England, he was made an honorary member of the M.C.C., which changed its rules to allow a current professional to join the club. The selectors appointed him as England captain for the entire forthcoming series against South Africa, on the condition he reduced time wasting by the team. Usually, captains were appointed for one or two matches; the only other captain to be appointed for a whole summer was [[C. B. Fry]] in 1912.<ref name=Wis55/><ref>Howat, pp. 166&ndash;67.</ref> However, Hutton's form was uncertain at the start of the season. He captained M.C.C. against the tourists, but withdrew from the final day of the match with lumbago and his uncertain health led him to resign the England captaincy. The selectors made Peter May captain in his place and appointed Hutton as a selector.<ref>Howat, p. 168.</ref> Hutton continued to play for Yorkshire until the end of June. Against Nottinghamshire, he scored 194 in five hours. His last 100 runs came in an hour, a fast rate of scoring, but this was his final first-class century. After the following match, his back became too painful to continue and he did not play again that season.<ref name=H169>Howat, p. 169.</ref> In eleven first-class matches, he had scored 537 runs at an average of 29.83.<ref name=fcbatting/> In June, he was [[Knight Bachelor|knighted]] for services to cricket.<ref name=obit/> Following the advice of a specialist, Hutton announced his retirement from first-class cricket in January 1956. He was 39, an early retirement age for the period.<ref name=Wis55/><ref name=H169/> He played one further match in 1957 for M.C.C. against Lancashire, and two matches in 1960 for M.C.C. and L. C. Steven's XI.<ref name=fcmatches/> He had played in 79 Test matches, scoring 6,971 runs at an average of 56.67 with 19 hundreds. In all first-class cricket, he scored 40,140 runs at an average of 55.51 with 129 hundreds.<ref name=profile>{{cite web | url = http://www.cricinfo.com/england/content/player/14334.html| title = Sir Leonard Hutton (player profile)| publisher = ESPNCricinfo | accessdate = 12 August 2010}}</ref>

==Style and technique==
===Batting===
''Wisden'' viewed Hutton, with [[Jack Hobbs]], as "one of the two most accomplished professional batsmen to have played for his country",<ref name=obit/> and following the Second World War, critics regarded him the best batsman in the world.<ref name=Frith>{{cite web | last = Frith | first = David | url = http://www.cricinfo.com/magazine/content/story/464021.html| title = David Frith on Len Hutton| publisher = ESPNCricinfo | accessdate = 13 August 2010}}</ref> The official Yorkshire history describes him as "technically and aesthetically the best batsman to play for Yorkshire".<ref name="Hodgson, p. 139"/> E. W. Swanton believed that if Hobbs was the greatest professional batsman, Hutton, along with Hammond and Compton, came next.<ref name=Sw146>Swanton, p. 146.</ref> However, Hutton was more cautious than these others; following the lead of Herbert Sutcliffe, he saw the role of an opening batsman as defensive. After the war, the weakness of the Yorkshire and England batting meant that both teams' batting success often depended on Hutton, causing him to moderate his approach further. The basis of his game was a good defensive technique, although he was able to accelerate and play attacking shots when the situation demanded.<ref name=Frith/><ref name=Sw146/><ref>Woodhouse, p. 374.</ref> Cricket historian [[David Frith]] believes that "there was an apparent touch of genius about his batsmanship",<ref name=Frith/> and Alan Gibson described Hutton's [[Drive (cricket)|off drive]] as "the glory of the game."<ref>Gibson, p. 188.</ref> He was particularly effective on difficult batting pitches.<ref name=Hod142>Hodgson, p. 142.</ref> Statistically, Hutton stands near the highest achievers. His Test match run tally of 6,971 at the time of his retirement, was the third-highest ever; his average of 56.67 is seventh highest of those who played at least fifty Test matches, as of August 2010, while only Sutcliffe has a higher average among openers who scored over 4,000 runs. He also displayed consistency; his annual average only fell below 50 three times, he averaged over 50 each year from 1947 to 1954 and scored 20 or more in 90 out his 138 innings.<ref>{{cite web | last = Rajesh| first = S| url = http://www.cricinfo.com/magazine/content/story/463972.html| title = Consistently prolific| publisher = ESPNCricinfo | accessdate = 13 August 2010}}</ref>

Hutton's batting technique was orthodox and conventional, becoming a model for future batsmen. John Woodcock believes that he seemed to possess great intuition, for example playing mystery spinners Ramadhin and Iverson with ease.<ref>Woodcock, p. 53.</ref> His batting stance was relaxed and still, his first movement being to slide his right foot back and across towards middle stump. He often played the ball off the [[Glossary of cricket terms#B|back foot]], getting right back onto his stumps, but never played as far forward, preferring to let the ball come to him and play it late.<ref name=W55/> Occasionally, he left a slight gap between his bat and pads, meaning he was sometimes bowled through it when out of form. He only played attacking shots when they presented no risk, and he rarely lifted the ball in the air; he hit just seven sixes in Test matches.<ref name=profile/><ref name=W55>Woodcock, p. 55.</ref>

===Captaincy===
As captain, Hutton believed that the key to success was a strong pace attack, stemming from his experiences against Lindwall and Miller, which influenced his support of Trueman, Statham and Tyson at various times. His natural inclination and the background to his appointment made him a cautious captain, for example slowing down of the game to rest his fast bowlers which set a precedent for other captains.<ref name=G190>Gibson, p. 190.</ref> A poor communicator, Hutton distanced himself from his team when they needed a stronger lead.<ref>Woodcock, p. 54.</ref> Tactically, Norman Yardley found him "sound rather than venturesome".<ref name=H198>Howat, p. 198.</ref> Run saving was his main priority, but he quickly adjusted his approach to attack the weakness of a particular batsmen.<ref name=H198/> In 1979, Alan Gibson named Hutton the best England captain.<ref name=G190/> Jim Kilburn believed that Hutton pursued a serious appoach to all matches, to the point where he missed some enjoyment of the game. Kilburn wrote that the "outstanding characteristic of his captaincy was shrewdness. He made no romantic gestures; he lit no fires of inspiration. He invited admiration rather than affection and would have exchanged either or both for effective obedience."<ref>{{cite web | last = Kilburn | first = JM | url = http://www.cricinfo.com/cricketer/content/story/148526.html| title = Len Hutton retires| publisher = The Cricketer (ESPNCricinfo) | accessdate = 15 August 2010}}</ref> 

Hutton rarely captained Yorkshire, except in the absence of the official captain, through a combination of poor health, frequent absences with England and the presence of amateur Norman Yardley in the side. A quiet, serious man who nevertheless possessed a quiet sense of humour,<ref name=ODNB/><ref name=Sw145/> the dressing room clashes of the Yorkshire side of the 1950s did not appeal to him,<ref name=Hod142/> and as the side's senior professional, he did not always provide the guidance which younger players in the side were seeking.<ref>Howat, p. 88.</ref>

==Personal life==
Hutton married Dorothy Mary Dennis on 16 September 1939 at [[Wykeham, Scarborough|Wykeham near Scarborough]]. The couple met at an end-of-season dance which Dorothy had attended with her brother, former Yorkshire cricketer [[Frank Dennis]].<ref>Howat, p. 23.</ref> The couple lived in Pudsey until 1955.<ref name=H49>Howat, p. 49.</ref> Their first son, [[Richard Hutton (cricketer)|Richard]], who later played for Yorkshire and England, was born on 6 September 1942.<ref>Howat, p. 55.</ref> A second, John, followed in May 1947.<ref name="Howat, p. 67"/>

During the war, Hutton worked for paper manufacturer Thomas Owen and Company, for whom he continued to work while not playing cricket.<ref name="Howat, p. 60"/> Following his cricketing retirement, Hutton worked in broadcasting until 1961.<ref>Howat, pp. 169&ndash;70.</ref> Journalism provided a more permanent career; he had written in ''[[The News of the World]]'' while a player,<ref name="Howat, p. 183">Howat, p. 183.</ref> and after 1955, he wrote for the London [[The Evening News (London newspaper)|''Evening News'']] until 1963. Hutton's increasing commitments in the south of England meant he moved to North London in 1959.<ref>Howat, p. 175.</ref> In 1960, Hutton was invited to join the engineering firm of J. H. Fenner,<ref>Howat, p. 176.</ref> mainly working in a [[public relations]] capacity. Later, as he became more familiar with the technical side of the firm's work, he moved into marketing and overseas promotion of products.<ref>Howat, pp. 177&ndash;82.</ref> He became a director of the firm in 1973,<ref name=ODNB>{{cite web  | last = Howat  | first = Gerald M.

Hutton maintained his connections with cricket, becoming an England Test selector in 1975 and 1976; however, his work with Fenner's limited the time he could devote to watching players and he disliked committees. Feeling unable to do the job properly, he resigned in 1977.<ref name="Howat, p. 183"/> He continued to write, following ''Cricket is my Life'' with ''Just my story'' in 1956, collaborating with another journalist, R. J. Hayter. In 1958&ndash;59, Hutton travelled to Australia to cover the M.C.C. tour as correspondent for the ''Evening News'', again assisted by a journalist, while between 1963 and 1986, he wrote for ''[[The Observer]]''.<ref>Howat, pp. 183&ndash;86.</ref> A third book, ''Thirty Years in Cricket'' followed in 1984.<ref name=ODNB/> Hutton became involved with Surrey cricket in later years but maintained links with Yorkshire, and assumed the position of Yorkshire president in January 1990.<ref name=ODNB/>

In his final years, Hutton suffered from ill health and became increasingly frail. In September 1990, he suffered a [[Traumatic aortic rupture|ruptured aorta]] shortly after watching a cricket match at the Oval. After an unsuccessful operation, he died on 6 September. At a memorial service held at York Minster, his former team-mate and rival for the captaincy David Sheppard gave the address.<ref name=ODNB/><ref name=Sw145>Swanton, p. 145.</ref>
