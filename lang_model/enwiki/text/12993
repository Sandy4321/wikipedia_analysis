'''Stephen Robert Irwin''' (22 February 1962 <U+2013> 4 September 2006), known simply as '''Steve Irwin''' and [[nickname]]d "'''The Crocodile Hunter'''", was an [[Australia]]n television personality, wildlife expert, and conservationist.

Irwin achieved worldwide fame from the television series ''[[The Crocodile Hunter]]'', an internationally broadcast [[nature documentary|wildlife documentary]] series which he co-hosted with his wife [[Terri Irwin|Terri]]. Together, the couple also co-owned and operated [[Australia Zoo]], founded by Irwin's parents in [[Beerwah, Queensland|Beerwah]], about 80&nbsp;km (50 miles) north of the [[Queensland]] state capital city of [[Brisbane, Australia|Brisbane]].

Irwin died on 4 September 2006 after being pierced in the [[chest]] by a [[stingray]] barb while filming in Australia's [[Great Barrier Reef]]. Since her husband's death, Terri Irwin has continued to operate Australia Zoo and raise their two children.  The [[Sea Shepherd Conservation Society]] ship [[MY Steve Irwin|MY ''Steve Irwin'']] was named in his honour.

== Early life ==
Irwin was born on his mother's birthday to Lyn and [[Bob Irwin]] in [[Essendon, Victoria|Essendon]], a [[suburb]] of [[Melbourne]], [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]].<ref name="larry_king_transcript" />  He moved with his parents as a child to Queensland in 1970, where he attended Landsborough State School and Caloundra State High School.<ref>[http://education.qld.gov.au/community/steve-irwin.html "Honour Steve Irwin's passion for nature"], Queensland Government Department of Education and Training, 2006.</ref>  Irwin described his father as a wildlife expert interested in [[herpetology]], while his mother Lyn was a [[wildlife]] rehabilitator. After moving to Queensland, Bob and Lyn Irwin started the small Queensland Reptile and Fauna Park, where Steve grew up around [[crocodile]]s and other [[reptile]]s.

Irwin became involved with the park in a number of ways, including taking part in daily animal feeding, as well as care and maintenance activities. On his sixth birthday he was given a {{convert|12|ft|0|adj=on}} [[Morelia amethistina|scrub python]]. He began handling crocodiles at the age of nine after his father had educated him on reptiles from an early age.<ref>{{cite web | title = Biography: Steve Irwin | url = http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,20867,20350280-601,00.html | work = [[The Australian]] | publisher = News Limited |date = 4 September 2006 | accessdate = 4 September 2006}}</ref> Also at age nine he wrestled his first crocodile, again under his father's supervision.<ref>{{cite journal | last = Wulff | first = Jennifer | authorlink =  | coauthors =  | title = Wild by Nature.

== Career ==
[[Image:Steve irwin at Australia zoo.jpg|left|thumb|250px|Irwin feeding a crocodile at [[Australia Zoo]].]]

=== Marriage and family ===
[[Image:Tirwin.jpg|thumb|right|Terri Raines Irwin, the wife of Steve Irwin]]
In 1991, Irwin met [[Terri Irwin|Terri Raines]], an [[United States|American]] naturalist from [[Eugene, Oregon|Eugene]], [[Oregon]] who was visiting wildlife rehabilitation facilities in Australia and had decided to visit the zoo. According to the couple, it was [[love at first sight]]. Terri said at the time, "I thought there was no one like this anywhere in the world. He sounded like an environmental Tarzan, a larger-than-life superhero guy."<ref name=Who.com>{{cite web | url = http://www.who.com/who/scoop/article/0,19971,1531530,00.html | title = Reptile Romance | accessdate = 4 September 2006 | date = 2 November 2002 | work = Who Magazine | publisher = Time Inc }}</ref>  They were engaged four months later and were married in Eugene on 4 June 1992. Together they had two children: a daughter, [[Bindi Irwin|Bindi Sue Irwin]] (born 24 July 1998), and a son, Robert Clarence "Bob" (named after Irwin's father) Irwin (born 1 December 2003). Bindi Sue is jointly named after two of Steve Irwin's favourite animals: Bindi, a [[Saltwater Crocodile|saltwater crocodile]], and Sui, a [[Staffordshire Bull Terrier]] who died in June 2004.  Irwin was as enthusiastic about his family as he was about his work. He once described his daughter Bindi as "the reason [he] was put on the Earth." His wife once said, "The only thing that could ever keep him away from the animals he loves are the people he loves even more."<ref name="larry_king_transcript"/> Although the Irwins were happily married, they did not wear [[wedding rings]]; they believed that in their line of work, wearing [[jewellery]] could pose a [[hazard]] to them and/or the animals.<ref>[http://www.americanprofile.com/article/3687.html Americanprofile.com.] Retrieved 7 September 2007.</ref>

=== ''The Crocodile Hunter'' and related work ===
Steve and Terri spent their [[honeymoon]] trapping crocodiles together.  Film footage of their honeymoon, taken by [[John Stainton]], became the first episode of ''[[The Crocodile Hunter]]''. The series debuted on Australian TV screens in 1996, and made its way onto North American television the following year. ''The Crocodile Hunter'' became successful in the United States, the UK,<ref>Platt, R: "A Natural Presenter at One With Nature" The Guardian. 5 September 2006</ref> and over 130 other countries, reaching 500 million people.  Irwin's exuberant and enthusiastic presenting style, broad [[Australian English|Australian accent]], signature [[khaki]] shorts, and [[catch phrase|catchphrase]] "Crikey!" became known worldwide.<ref>{{cite web | first = Sandra | last = Lee | title = Wild Thing | url = http://159.54.226.237/00_issues/000618/000618croc_hunter.html | publisher = [[USA Weekend|USA Weekend Magazine]] | date = 18 June 2000 | accessdate = 15 January 2011}}</ref> Sir [[David Attenborough]] praised Irwin for introducing many to the natural world, saying "He taught them how wonderful and exciting it was, he was a born communicator."<ref name="Communicator">{{cite news | title =  Tears of Crocodile Hunger's window at TV awards | work = Mail Online | publisher = [[The Daily Mail]] | date = 1 November 2006 | url = http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-413871/Tears-Crocodile-Hunters-widow-TV-awards.html | accessdate = 16 January 2011}}</ref>

American satellite and cable television channel [[Animal Planet]] ended ''The Crocodile Hunter'' with a series finale entitled "Steve's Last Adventure." The last Crocodile Hunter documentary spanned three hours with footage of Irwin's across-the-world adventure in locations including the [[Himalayas]], the [[Yangtze River]], [[Borneo]], and the [[Kruger National Park]]. Irwin went on to star in other Animal Planet documentaries, including ''[[Croc Files]]'',<ref>[http://kids.discovery.com/fansites/crocfiles/crocfiles.html "Croc Files"], Discovery Kids web site, retrieved 15 January 2011.</ref> ''[[The Crocodile Hunter Diaries]]'',<ref>[http://animal.discovery.com/fansites/crocdiaries/about/about.html "The Crocodile Hunter Diaries <U+2014> About the Show"], Animal Planet web site, retrieved 15 January 2011.</ref> and ''New Breed Vets''.<ref>[http://www.newbreedvets.com/html/ "New Breed Vets <U+2014> Synopsis"], [[Animal Planet]] web site, 10 December 2006.</ref> During a January 2006 interview on ''The Tonight Show with Jay Leno'', Irwin announced that [[Discovery Kids]] would be developing a show for his daughter, [[Bindi Sue Irwin]]<ref>''The Tonight Show with Jay Leno'', 13 January 2006.</ref> <U+2014> a plan realised after his death as the series ''[[Bindi the Jungle Girl]]''.<ref>[http://www.theage.com.au/opinion/despite-the-facts-steve-irwin-is-still-alive-for-bindis-fans-20080713-3eh6.html "Despite the facts, Steve Irwin is still alive for Bindi's fans"], ''[[The Age]]'', 14 July 2008.</ref>

=== Other television and film work ===
In 1998, Irwin continued, working with director [[Mark Strickson]], to present ''The Ten Deadliest Snakes in the World''.<ref>[http://www.wildfilmhistory.org/film/310/The+Ten+Deadliest+Snakes+in+the+World+with+Steve+Irwin.html "The Ten Deadliest Snakes in the World with Steve Irwin (1998)"], ''Wild Film History'', retrieved 5 February 2011.</ref> He appeared on several episodes of ''[[The Tonight Show with Jay Leno (1992 TV series)|The Tonight Show with Jay Leno]]''.<ref>[http://www.nytimes.com/2006/09/05/obituaries/05irwin.html?_r=1 "Steve Irwin, Wildlife Master, Is Killed by a Stingray at 44"], ''The New York Times'', 5 September 2006:  "... he was an ebullient staple of American talk shows ranging from 'The Tonight Show With Jay Leno' to 'Live With Regis and Kelly.'"</ref><ref>[http://www.arkanimals.com/dlg/steveirwin.htm "Steve Irwin, Bob Irwin, Murray the Crocodile, & The Snake Faux Pas"], Diana L.

Under Irwin's leadership, the operations grew to include the zoo, the television series, the Steve Irwin Conservation Foundation (later renamed [[Wildlife Warriors]]), and the International Crocodile Rescue.  Improvements to the Australia Zoo include the Animal Planet Crocoseum, the rainforest aviary and Tiger Temple. Irwin mentioned that he was considering opening an Australia Zoo in [[Las Vegas, Nevada|Las Vegas]], [[Nevada]], and possibly at other sites around the world.<ref name="larry_king_transcript">{{cite news|url=http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0411/25/lkl.01.html |title=LARRY KING LIVE Interview With Steve Irwin |accessdate=4 September 2006 |last=King |first=Larry |authorlink=Larry King |coauthors=Irwin, Steve |date=25 November 2004 |work=CNN |publisher=Cable News Network LP, LLLP}}</ref>

In 2001, Irwin appeared in a [[cameo appearance|cameo role]] in the [[Eddie Murphy]] film ''[[Dr. Dolittle 2]]'', in which a crocodile warns Dolittle that he knows Irwin is going to grab him and is prepared to attack when he does, but Dolittle fails to warn Irwin in time. Irwin's only starring feature film role was in 2002's ''[[The Crocodile Hunter: Collision Course]]'', which was released to mixed reviews. In the film Irwin (who portrayed himself and performed numerous stunts) mistakes some [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] agents for poachers. He sets out to stop them from capturing a crocodile, which, unknown to him, has actually swallowed a [[tracking transmitter]].  The film won the Best Family Feature Film award for a comedy film at the [[Young Artist Awards]]. The film was produced on a budget of about [[United States dollar|$]]12 million, and has grossed $33 million.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=crocodilehunter.htm |title=The Crocodile Hunter:Collision Course |work=[[Box Office Mojo]] |publisher=Box Office Mojo, LLC}}</ref> To promote the film, Irwin was featured in an animated short produced by [[Animax Entertainment]] for Intermix.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.animaxent.com/crocodile_hunter| publisher=Animax| title=The Crocodile Hunter| accessdate=10 September 2006 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20061026105519/http://www.animaxent.com/crocodile_hunter |archivedate = 26 October 2006}}</ref>

In 2002, Irwin and his family appeared in the [[Wiggles]] video/DVD release ''Wiggly Safari'', which was set in Australia Zoo and featured singing and dancing inspired by Australian wildlife.<ref>[http://www.amazon.com/Wiggles-Wiggly-Safari/dp/B000068GFY ''The Wiggles <U+2014> Wiggly Safari''] (DVD), Lyons / Hit Ent., 3 September 2002.</ref>

In 2006, Irwin provided his voice for the 2006 [[animated film]] ''[[Happy Feet]]'', as an [[Southern Elephant Seal|elephant seal]] named Trev. The film was dedicated to Irwin, as he died during post-production.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0366548/trivia | title=Trivia for Happy Feet (2006) | publisher=[[IMDB]] | accessdate=26 November 2006}}</ref>  Another, previously incomplete scene, featuring Irwin providing the voice of an albatross and essentially playing himself, was restored to the DVD release.<ref>[http://hamptonroads.com/node/243931 "Extras in 'Happy Feet' include clip of late Steve Irwin"], ''HamptonRoads.com'', 30 March 2007.</ref>

=== Media campaigns ===
[[Image:Posters steve koala.jpg|thumb|right|A poster from Irwin's ''Quarantine Matters!'' campaign.]]
Irwin was also involved in several media campaigns. He enthusiastically joined with the [[Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service]] to promote Australia's strict [[quarantine]]/[[customs]] requirements, with advertisements and posters featuring slogans such as, "Quarantine Matters! Don't muck with it".  His payments for these advertising campaigns were directed into his wildlife fund.<ref name=Willis>{{cite web | url = http://www.abc.net.au/pm/content/2003/s982212.htm | title = PM - Steve Irwin defends quarantine ad | accessdate = 5 September 2006 | author = Willis, Louise | coauthors = Irwin, Steve; Colvin, Mark | date = 4 November 2003 | work = | publisher = [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation|ABC]] }}</ref>

In 2004, Irwin was appointed ambassador for [[The Ghan]], the passenger train running from [[Adelaide]] to [[Alice Springs]] in the central Australian outback, when the line was extended all the way to [[Darwin, Northern Territory|Darwin]] on the northern coast that year. For some time he was sponsored by [[Toyota]].<ref>[http://www.google.com/search?q=cache:JQzo9gBgQ70J:trd.toyota.com.au/psa/articles/0,2481,subId%25253D816%252526sectionId%25253D714,00.html+steve+irwin+toyota&hl=en&gl=au&ct=clnk&cd=2&client=firefox-a Google cache copy of a Toyota Australia page]: Crikey!

Irwin was a keen promoter for Australian tourism in general and Queensland tourism in particular. In 2002, the Australia Zoo was voted Queensland's top tourist attraction.<ref name=Murdoch>{{cite news | first = Anna | last = King Murdoch |title = He's smart, by crikey | url = http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2003/06/09/1055010919523.html | work = The Age | publisher = The Age Company Ltd | date = 10 June 2003 | accessdate = 4 September 2006 }}</ref> His immense popularity in the United States meant he often promoted Australia as a tourist destination there.<ref name=Elliot>{{cite news | first = Geoff | last = Elliot | title = Keep it simple, mate | work = [[The Australian]] | publisher = News Limited | date = 27 January 2006 }}[http://www.australianmade.com.au/news/articles/7364.asp  Copy at www.australianmade.com.au]</ref>  As a part of the United States' "Australia Week" celebrations in January 2006, Irwin appeared at [[UCLA]]'s [[Pauley Pavilion]] in [[Los Angeles]], [[California]].<ref>[https://encrypted.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&cd=66&ved=0CK8CEBYwQQ&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.asucla.ucla.edu%2Fdocs%2F120205min.doc&ei=iXoyTYHoCYH6swOVz9nnBQ&usg=AFQjCNF9I0WerbTwDEpyyTYh8_dJLoyRcQ&sig2=vw22WLbR6R0PSbvZZB2OyQ Minutes] of the Associated Students, UCLA, Board of Directors Regular Meeting, 2 December 2005, p.4: "The week of January 15, 2006 will be 'Australia Week' on campus.

=== Search and rescue in Mexico ===
In November 2003, Irwin was filming a documentary on [[sea lion]]s off the coast of [[Mexico]]'s [[Baja California Peninsula]] when he heard via his boat's radio that two [[scuba diver]]s were reported missing in the area. Irwin and his entire crew suspended operations to aid in the search. His team's divers searched with the rescue divers, and Irwin used his vessel to patrol the waters around the island where the incident occurred, as well as using his satellite communications system to call in a rescue plane. On the second day of the search, [[kayaker]]s found one of the divers, Scott Jones, perched on a narrow rock ledge jutting out from the side of a cliff. Irwin and a crewmember escorted him to Irwin's boat. Jones did not recognise Irwin. The other lost diver, Katie Vrooman, was found dead by a search plane later the same day not far from Jones' location.<ref>[http://www.cdnn.info/safety/s031123/s031123.html CDNN: Diver remembers day her scuba buddy died in Baja] by Thomas Geyer</ref>

== Honours ==
In 1997, while on a fishing trip on the coast of Queensland with his father, Irwin discovered a new species of turtle.  Later given the honour of naming the newly discovered species, he named it [[Irwin's turtle]] (''[[Elseya irwini]]'') after his family.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.deh.gov.au/cgi-bin/abrs/fauna/details.pl?pstrVol=REPTILIA;pstrTaxa=3312;pstrChecklistMode=1 | title = Elseya irwini  | accessdate = 4 September 2006 | work = Australian Faunal Directory | publisher = Department of the Environment and Heritage, Commonwealth of Australia }}</ref>  Another newly discovered Australian animal <U+2014> a species of air-breathing land [[snail]], ''[[Crikey steveirwini]]'', was named after Irwin in 2009.<ref name="Stanisic">Stanisic J.

== Environmentalism ==
{{See also|Wildlife Warriors}}
Irwin was a passionate [[conservationist]] and believed in promoting [[environmentalism]] by sharing his excitement about the natural world rather than preaching to people. He was concerned with conservation of [[Endangered species|endangered animals]] and [[Deforestation|land clearing]] leading to loss of habitat. He considered conservation to be the most important part of his work: "I consider myself a wildlife warrior. My mission is to save the world's endangered species."<ref name=Murdoch/>  Irwin bought "large tracts of land" in [[Australia]], [[Vanuatu]], [[Fiji]] and the [[United States]], which he described as "like [[national park]]s" and stressed the importance of people realising that they could each make a difference.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.abc.net.au/tv/enoughrope/transcripts/s960998.htm | title = Enough Rope with Andrew Denton - episode 30: Steve Irwin  | accessdate= 4 September 2006|author=Denton, Andrew |authorlink=Andrew Denton | coauthors = Irwin, Steve | date= 6 October 2003 |work= | publisher = [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation|ABC]] }}</ref>

[[Sir David Attenborough]] was an inspiration to Irwin, according to his widow. When presenting a [[Lifetime Achievement Award]] to Attenborough after Irwin's death at the British [[National Television Awards]] on 31 October 2006, Terri Irwin said, "If there's one person who directly inspired my husband it's the person being honoured tonight....

== Sporting activities == <!-- say "sporting" to avoid the usage issue of "sports" vs. "sport" -->
Irwin loved [[mixed martial arts]] competitions and trained with Greg Jackson in the fighting/grappling system of [[Gaidojutsu]].<ref>[http://www.jacksons.tv/mma/index.php Jackson's Gaidojutsu Self Defense] www.jacksons.tv. Retrieved 7 September 2006.</ref>

Like many Australians, he was a avid cricket fan. This was seen during his visit to [[Sri Lanka]] where he played cricket with some local children and said "I love cricket" and "It's a shame we have to go catch some snakes now". This was seen during the ''Crocodile Hunter'' episode <U+201C>Island of the Snakes".<ref>{{cite web | url = http://youtube.com/watch?v=UKdXrSjVdOM&feature=related | title = Island of Snakes part 6 | date = 26 February 2008 | accessdate = 26 February 2008 }}</ref>

Having grown up in Essendon, Irwin was a fan of the [[Essendon Football Club|Essendon Bombers]], an [[Australian rules football]] club in the [[Australian Football League]].<ref Name=times>[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,60-2342450,00.html "Steve Irwin"] The Times Online 5 September 2006.

Having lived in Queensland most of his life, Irwin was also a fan of [[rugby league]]. As a teenager, he played for the Caloundra Sharks as a second-rower,<ref>[http://www.news.com.au/couriermail/story/0,23739,20383719-3102,00.html Our mate Steve]. URL accessed on 12 September 2006</ref> and as an adult he was known to be a passionate [[Brisbane Broncos]] fan and was involved with the club on several occasions. On one occasion after turning up to training he asked if he could tackle the largest player, [[Shane Webcke]]. Despite being thrown to the ground and looking like he'd been crushed he was jovial about the experience. Irwin laughingly shared the experience with the [[Queensland state rugby league team|Queensland]] [[Rugby League State of Origin|State of Origin]] squad before the 2006 series.<ref>[http://www.news.com.au/story/0,10117,20350166-2,00.html Tributes flow for 'true original']. URL accessed on 12 September 2006</ref> Irwin also supported [[rugby union]], being a fan of the national team, the [[Australia national rugby union team|Wallabies]]. He once wore a Wallaby jersey during a demonstration at the zoo. A behind-the-scenes episode of ''The Crocodile Hunter'' showed Irwin and the crew finding a [[petrol]] station in a remote part of [[Namibia]] to watch the Wallabies defeat [[France national rugby union team|France]] in the [[1999 Rugby World Cup]] Final. Irwin was also a talented surfer.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.sunshinecoastdaily.com.au/localnews/storydisplay.cfm?storyid=3699961&thesection=localnews&thesubsection=&thesecondsubsection | title = Surfers invited to pay tribute | date = 6 September 2006 | accessdate = 7 November 2006 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070928061107/http://www.sunshinecoastdaily.com.au/localnews/storydisplay.cfm?storyid=3699961&thesection=localnews&thesubsection=&thesecondsubsection |archivedate = 28 September 2007}}</ref>

[[File:MV Steve Irwin Melbourne.jpg|thumb|200px|MV ''Steve Irwin'' approaching Melbourne in February 2008]]

A controversial incident occurred during a public show on 2 January 2004, when Irwin carried his one-month-old son, Bob, in his arm while hand-feeding a chicken carcass to Murray, a {{convert|3.8|m|ftin|adj=on}} saltwater crocodile. The infant was close to the crocodile, and comparisons were made in the press to [[Michael Jackson]]'s dangling his son outside a German hotel window.<ref name="babydangling">{{cite news

In June 2004, allegations were made that he disturbed wildlife (namely [[whale]]s, [[sea lion|seals]] and [[penguin]]s) while filming a documentary, ''Ice Breaker'', in [[Antarctica]].

After questions arose in 2003 about Irwin being paid $175,000 worth of taxpayers' money to appear in a television advertisement and his possible political ties, Irwin told the [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]] (ABC) that he was a conservationist and did not choose sides in politics.  His comments describing Australian Prime Minister [[John Howard]] as the "greatest leader in the world" earned him scorn in the media.<ref>{{cite news | first =Miranda | last =Devine | title =Crikey!

Irwin was criticised for having an unsophisticated view of [[conservation in Australia]] that seemed more linked to tourism than to the problems Australia faces as a [[Australia (continent)|continent]].  In response to questions of Australia's problems with [[overgrazing]], [[Salinity in Australia|salinity]], and [[erosion]], Irwin responded, "Cows have been on our land for so long that Australia has evolved to handle those big animals." The Sydney Morning Herald concluded with the opinion that his message was confusing and amounted to "eating roos and crocs is bad for tourism, and therefore more cruel than eating other animals".<ref>{{cite news | first = Frank | last = Robson | author =  | url = http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2006/09/04/1157222053963.html?page=fullpage#contentSwap3 | title = Crikey, it's raw Stevo! | work = Good Weekend | publisher = Sydney Morning Herald | date = First published April 2002, republished 4 September 2006 | accessdate = 5 September 2006 }}</ref>

{{wikinews|Crocodile Hunter's Steve Irwin dies at 44}}
On 4 September 2006, Irwin was fatally pierced in the chest by a [[stingray]] spine while [[snorkelling]] at the [[Great Barrier Reef]], at [[Batt Reef]], which is located off the coast of [[Port Douglas, Queensland|Port Douglas]] in north [[Queensland]]. Irwin was in the area filming his own [[Documentary film|documentary]], ''[[Ocean's Deadliest]]'', but weather had stalled filming. Irwin decided to take the opportunity to film some shallow water shots for a segment in the television program his daughter [[Bindi Irwin]] was hosting<ref name="theage">{{cite news | title = Croc Hunter Irwin killed by stingray | publisher = The Age | date = 4 September 2006 | url = http://www.theage.com.au/news/National/Croc-Hunter-Steve-Irwin-died-instantly/2006/09/04/1157222051588.html | accessdate = 4 September 2006}}</ref> when the ray suddenly turned and lashed out at him with the spine on its tail.<ref>{{cite news | title = Farewell to a larrikin adventurer, killed in his prime | url = http://www.smh.com.au/news/national/farewell-to-a-larrikin-adventurer-killed-in-his-prime/2006/09/04/1157222072696.html?page=fullpage#contentSwap1 | work =The Sydney Morning Herald | date = 5 September 2006 | accessdate = 4 February 2011}}</ref>

Initially, when CNN's [[Larry King]] interviewed Irwin's colleague [[John Stainton]] late on 4 September 2006, Stainton denied the suggestion that Irwin had pulled the spine out of his chest or that he had seen footage of the event, insisting that the anecdote was "absolute rubbish."<ref name="cnnstaintoninterview">{{cite news | title = Crocodile Hunter Remembered | url = http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0609/04/acd.01.html | accessdate = 5 September 2006 | work=CNN}}</ref> However, the following day, when he first described the video to the media, he stated, "Steve came over the top of the ray and the tail came up, and spiked him here [in the chest], and he pulled it out and the next minute he's gone."<ref name="AustNews"/>

It is thought, in the absence of a [[coroner]]'s report, that a combination of the toxins and the puncture wound from the spine caused Irwin to die of [[cardiac arrest]], with most of the damage being inflicted by tears to arteries or other main blood vessels.<ref>{{cite news | title = Serrated knife-like barb, not toxins, the likely killer | url = http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2006/09/04/1157222072726.html | author = Richard Macey | date = 5 September 2006 | publisher = Sydney Morning Herald | accessdate = 5 September 2006}}</ref> A similar incident in [[Florida]] a month later, in which a man survived a stingray barb through the [[heart]], suggested that Irwin's removing the barb might have caused or hastened his death.<ref>{{cite news|last= |first=|authorlink= |coauthors= | date=20 October 2006 | url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/world/leaving-stingray-barb-in-saved-him/2006/10/20/1160851103853.html |title=Irwin might have survived: surgeon |work=Sydney Morning Herald |pages= |publisher= Fairfax Publishing | language= |accessdate=20 October 2006 }}</ref>

Crew members aboard his boat called the emergency services in the nearest city of [[Cairns]] and administered [[CPR]] as they rushed the boat to the nearby Low Islets to meet an emergency rescue helicopter. However, despite the best efforts of Irwin's crew, medical staff pronounced him dead when they arrived a short time later.<ref name="theage" />  According to Dr Ed O'Loughlin, who treated Irwin, "it became clear fairly soon that he had non-survivable injuries.

He also made a comparison with another well known conservationist: "If you compare [Irwin] with a responsible conservationist like [[Jacques-Yves Cousteau|Jacques Cousteau]], he looks like a cheap reality TV star."<ref>{{cite news | first = | last = AAP| title = Irwin's antics 'a danger to children'  | url = http://www.theage.com.au/news/national/irwins-antics-a-danger-to-children/2006/09/13/1157826993532.html | publisher=The Age | date = 13 September 2006 | accessdate = 13 September 2006 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news | author=Walls, Jeannette | url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/14626178/ | title=PETA sheds no crocodile tears for Steve Irwin | publisher=MSNBC | accessdate=14 September 2006}}</ref> The son of Jacques Cousteau, [[Jean-Michel Cousteau]]<U+2014>also a producer of wildlife documentaries<U+2014>took issue as well with Irwin's hands-on approach to nature television, saying, "You don't touch nature, you just look at it."  Cousteau went on to say that although Irwin's approach "goes very well on television", it would "interfere with nature, jump on animals, grab them, hold them, and have this very, very spectacular, dramatic way of presenting things" which he felt was "very misleading".<ref>{{cite news  | first=  | last=  | author=  | url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/world/irwin-interfered-with-nature-says-cousteau/2006/09/20/1158431752163.html | title=Irwin interfered with nature, says Cousteau  | work=  | publisher=Sydney Morning Herald | date=20 September 2006  | accessdate=20 September 2006}}</ref> Jacques Cousteau's grandson and Jean-Michel's nephew, [[Philippe Cousteau Jr.]], however, was working with Irwin on the "Ocean's Deadliest" documentary at the time of the accident and later described him as "a remarkable individual." Describing their project, he said, "I think why Steve was so excited about it that we were looking at these animals that people think of as, you know, dangerous and deadly monsters, and they're not. They all have an important place in the environment and in the world. And that was what his whole message was about."<ref>{{cite news  | first=  | last=  | author=  | url=http://www.cnn.com/2006/SHOWBIZ/TV/09/06/cnna.cousteau/index.html | title=Cousteau: Irwin a 'remarkable individual'  | work=  | publisher=CNN | date=6 September 2006  | accessdate=22 October 2006}}</ref>

=== Backlash against stingrays ===
Fatalities due to stingrays are infrequent and occurrences are not consistently collated,<ref>{{cite web | title = How Deadly Are Stingrays? | url = http://www.slate.com/id/2148992 | publisher = Washington Post Company | work = Slate | date = 5 September 2006 | accessdate = 15 September 2006 }}</ref> while there have been several others in Australia. Irwin's death is believed to be the only fatality from a stingray ever captured on film.<ref>{{cite news | title = Stingray Deaths Rare and Agonizing | url = http://www.cnn.com/2006/WORLD/asiapcf/09/04/australia.irwin.stingray.reut/index.html | publisher = [[Reuters]] | work = [[CNN]] | date = 4 September 2006 | accessdate = 4 September 2006 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20060921002229/http://www.cnn.com/2006/WORLD/asiapcf/09/04/australia.irwin.stingray.reut/index.html |archivedate = 21 September 2006}}</ref> In the weeks following Irwin's death, at least ten stingrays were found dead and mutilated, with their tails cut off, on the beaches of [[Queensland]], prompting speculation that they had been killed by fans of Irwin as an act of revenge. Michael Hornby, a friend of the late naturalist and executive director of Irwin's Wildlife Warrior fund, condemned any revenge killings.  "We just want to make it very clear that we will not accept and not stand for anyone who's taken a form of retribution. That's the last thing Steve would want," he said.<ref>{{cite news | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/5338118.stm | title = Irwin fans 'in revenge attacks' | publisher = BBC | date = 12 September 2006 | accessdate = 12 September 2006 }}</ref>

=== Funeral  ===
[[Premiers of Queensland|Queensland Premier]] [[Peter Beattie]] offered to hold a [[state funeral]] for Irwin <U+2014> an honour also agreed to by Prime Minister Howard.  The family decided, however, that such a funeral would not have been appropriate.  Irwin's father Bob stated that his son would not have wanted such an honour and would want to be remembered as an "[[bloke|ordinary bloke]]."<ref>{{cite news | url = http://www.theage.com.au/news/national/father-rejects-state-funeral-for-ordinary-bloke-son/2006/09/06/1157222201277.html | title = Father rejects state funeral for 'ordinary bloke' son | publisher = The Age | date = 7 September 2006 | accessdate = 7 September 2006}}</ref>  Beattie stated he would honour the decision of the Irwin family regarding their arrangements.

=== Public memorial service ===
A public service was held at the 5,500-seat Crocoseum at [[Australia Zoo]] on 20 September. The service was broadcast live, commercial free, in the eastern states of Australia, by free-to-air channels [[Seven Network|Seven]], [[Nine Network|Nine]] and the [[ABC Television|ABC]] in Australia, as well as live on subscription channel [[Sky News Australia]].  In addition, it was broadcast live and without commercials on [[Animal Planet]] in the United States, as well as to Germany, the UK, and Asia. It is estimated that over 300 million viewers worldwide watched the service.<ref>{{cite news | url = http://www.ecanadanow.com/world/2006/09/19/300-million-people-to-watch-steve-irwin-memorial/| title = 300 Million People To Watch Steve Irwin Memorial | publisher = ecanadanow.com  | date = 19 September 2006 | accessdate = 13 September 2006 }}</ref> The memorial was also rebroadcast in the US on Animal Planet on 1 January 2007, as part of their [[New Year's Day]] celebration, and again the following day.

[[Image:Australia zoo-Raffi Kojian-CIMG6415.JPG|thumb|right|250px|The "Crocoseum" at [[Australia Zoo]], where Steve Irwin's memorial service was held.]]

The memorial included a speech by Australian Prime Minister John Howard, as well as messages by celebrities from Australia and around the world including [[Hugh Jackman]], [[Cameron Diaz]], [[Justin Timberlake]], [[Kevin Costner]], [[Russell Crowe]], [[David Wenham]], [[Kelly Ripa]] and [[Larry King]]. Costner called Irwin a fearless man who was brave enough to let people see him as he was.<ref name="cnn_mourning">{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2006/SHOWBIZ/TV/09/19/crocodile.hunter.service/index.html| title= Thousands mourn 'Crocodile Hunter'|publisher=CNN|date=20 September 2006|accessdate=20 September 2006 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20060920222510/http://www.cnn.com/2006/SHOWBIZ/TV/09/19/crocodile.hunter.service/index.html |archivedate = 20 September 2006}}</ref>  Irwin's father, Bob Irwin, spoke at the memorial, as did his daughter Bindi and associates [[Wes Mannion]] and John Stainton.<ref name="cnn_mourning"/> [[Anthony Field]] of [[The Wiggles]] partly hosted the service, often sharing the screen with various animals, from koalas to elephants.  Australian music star [[John Williamson (singer)|John Williamson]] sang ''[[True Blue (John Williamson song)|True Blue]]'', which was Irwin's favourite song.  In a symbolic finish to the service, Irwin's truck was loaded up with gear and driven out of the arena for the last time as Williamson sang.  As a final tribute, Australia Zoo staff spelled out Irwin's catchphrase "Crikey" in yellow flowers as Irwin's truck was driven from the Crocoseum for the last time to end the service.

On the DVD of the animated film ''[[Happy Feet]]'', there is a [[deleted scene]] in which the main character, [[Mumble (Happy Feet)|Mumble]], meets an albatross (voiced by Irwin) and a blue whale. The scene was unfinished at first, but it was included on the DVD release to honour Irwin's memory, as Irwin had insisted on being in a film that contained [[Happy Feet#Environmental message|a message about the environment]]. However, this scene was removed from the movie, and it was decided to let Irwin play an [[elephant seal]] named Trev.

On 4 September 2007, Australian fans gathered at the Irwin family [[zoo]] on the [[Sunshine Coast, Queensland]] to commemorate the first anniversary of Irwin's death. State Premier [[Peter Beattie]] described Irwin as one of the state's greatest cultural [[ambassador]]s. On 15 November, Irwin's widow Terri and children, Bindi and Bob, remembered his life and achievements on "''Steve Irwin Day''."<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/6977281.stm  BBC NEWS, Australia remembers 'Croc Hunter']</ref>
