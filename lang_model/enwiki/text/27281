"'''Love Is Blindness'''" is a song by [[rock music|rock]] band [[U2]]. It is the twelfth and final track on their 1991 album ''[[Achtung Baby]]''. The song was written on a piano by lead singer [[Bono]] during the recording sessions for U2's 1988 album ''[[Rattle and Hum]]''. Intended for singer [[Nina Simone]], the band elected to keep it for ''Achtung Baby'' after playing it together. Thematically, the song describes a failing romance, mixing personal themes with imagery of metaphorical acts of terrorism. During the recording sessions for ''Achtung Baby'', guitarist [[The Edge]] separated from his wife, Aislinn O'Sullivan. The separation had a major effect on the development of the song; the ending [[guitar solo]] was a cathartic experience for The Edge, as he snapped several guitar strings during the song's recording.

"Love Is Blindness" made its live debut on the group's 1992-1993 [[Zoo TV Tour]] and was performed regularly during the tour, appearing at 154 of its 157 concerts. It was commonly played as either the penultimate or closing song; as the penultimate song, it was usually followed by a rendition of the [[Elvis Presley]] song "[[Can't Help Falling in Love]]". Following the tour, "Love Is Blindness" has been played live only two other times. The track was received favourably by critics and has been [[Cover version|covered]] by multiple artists.

During the recording sessions for ''Achtung Baby'', The Edge separated from his wife, Aislinn O'Sullivan. Reflecting on the impact it had on U2, Bono said, "We're a really tight community. This is not like somebody's, you know, girlfriend's left. We've grown up with these people, this our family, our community. This was really hard for us... It was like the first cracks on the beautiful porcelain jug with those beautiful flowers in it that was our music and our community, starting to go 'crack'."<ref name="FTSD">{{cite video |people=U2, [[Davis Guggenheim]] (Director) |title=[[From the Sky Down]] |medium=film |publisher=[[BBC Worldwide|BBC Worldwide Canada]] |date=2011 |time=50:53}}</ref> The Edge explained that travelling to Berlin to write and record provided him with an escape from his failing marriage: "I was disappearing into the music for a different reason. It was a refuge in a way. That approach didn't completely work. You know, I wasn't really... in a good positive headspace. I was running away, I suppose."<ref name="FTSD" /> While recording the solo that appears at the end of the song, The Edge "put everything into it, all the feeling, all the hurt, all the angst, everything went into that solo."<ref name="FTSD" /> Bono said, "his whole life came out of him when he played... when we went for the take, one string broke and he just kept playing harder and harder. Another string broke. And he has such a light touch, ordinarily, he's so gentle. All that left him for a kind of rage. And yet there's not one bum note in there."<ref name="U2232">McCormick (2006), p. 232</ref> Audio engineer [[Flood (producer)|Flood]] said the "bold, unadulterated, naked [guitar solo] sound was a combination of the part, the moment, a good guitar, a small amp, a simple mike. Edge just got an idea, tried it, and it worked straightaway."<ref>{{cite journal |title=Flood (record producer) |journal=[[Guitar Player]] |first=Joe |last=Gore |date=1 July 1995 |page=49 |volume=29 |issue=7 |issn=0017-5463}}</ref>

==Composition and theme==
[[File:The edge u2 at brasilia 2011.jpg|thumb|right|upright|alt=|The Edge (pictured in 2011) separated from his wife during the recording of ''Achtung Baby''. He channeled his painful emotions from that time into his guitar playing on the song.]]

"Love Is Blindness" runs for 4:23 (4 minutes, 23 seconds). According to [[Hal Leonard Corporation]]'s sheet music published at Musicnotes.com, it is played in [[Time signature|common time]] at a [[tempo]] of 48 beats per minute in a [[key (music)|key]] of [[B minor]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.musicnotes.com/sheetmusic/scorchVPE.asp?ppn=SC0021703 |title=U2 <U+2013> Love Is Blindness <U+2013> Digital sheet music |work=Musicnotes.com |publisher=[[Hal Leonard Corporation]] |accessdate=12 October 2011 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/62O2ATATf |archivedate=12 October 2011}}</ref>

The production team gave bassist [[Adam Clayton]]'s bass a "low end bass throbbing effect", which The Edge described as "a real stroke of genius from the production team."<ref name="U2228" /> Drummer [[Larry Mullen, Jr.]]'s drum pattern was taken from U2's 1987 single "[[I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For]]" and slowed down.<ref name="U2232" /> The lyrics "[mix] up the personal and the political." Bono noted that "There was some reference to the little death, which can be taken to mean a faint during orgasm but also works as an image of terrorism."<ref name="U2228" /> Quoting the lyric "A little death without mourning / No call and no warning / Baby, a dangerous idea / That almost makes sense", he said, "There's nothing more deadly than an idea&nbsp;<U+2013> or a person&nbsp;<U+2013> that's almost right. You know, it took the 20th century a hundred years to get over communism. There's another dangerous idea that almost made sense."<ref name="U2228" />

{{Quote box|quote="The song has images of terrorism, bomb-building, clockworks and cold steel, parked car. In a personal sense, I have observed the phenomenon of a person planting a kind of landmine that years later they will accidentally tread on and blow their lives to pieces. You can watch people doing it, wilfully getting involved in actions they will pay a very heavy price for later. Trajectory is everything."|source=<U+2014>Bono<ref name="U2228" /> |width=25% |align=left |style=padding:8px;}}

U2 biographer [[Bill Flanagan]] credits Bono's habit of keeping his lyrics "in flux until the last minute" with providing a narrative coherence to the album.<ref name="flan20">Flanagan (1996), p. 20</ref> Flanagan interpreted ''Achtung Baby'' as using the moon as a metaphor for a dark woman seducing the singer away from his virtuous love, the sun; he is tempted away from domestic life by an exciting nightlife and tests how far he can go before returning home.<ref>Flanagan (1996), p. 187</ref> For Flanagan, the final three songs on ''Achtung Baby''<U+2014>"[[Ultraviolet (Light My Way)]]", "[[Acrobat (song)|Acrobat]]", and "Love Is Blindness"<U+2014>are about how the couple deal with the suffering they have forced on each other.<ref name="flan20" /> ''[[Uncut (magazine)|Uncut]]'' contributor Gavin Martin believed the song contained "images of love, debased or abandoned."<ref name="Martin" /> He wrote, "With its stark, churchlike organ intro, pulsating bass synth and guitar reverb stretched into a hallucinatory squall, it brilliantly describes the discord and dread that provide a constant undertow to ''Achtung Baby''. And yet, through its alluring sonic palette and wounded but sensual vocal, 'Love Is Blindness' also maps out a search for harmony and salvation".<ref name="Martin" /> 

Author Atara Stein wrote that the song "suggests that love can operate only through a willful self-deception, a voluntary surrender to what one knows is an illusion. The singer begs his lover to 'wrap the night' around him because, as he proclaims, 'I don't want to see.' The singer knows that the image he creates of his loved one is false, but it is the only image that can satisfy him. He must perceive his beloved in idealized terms, so she can reflect back to him the image of himself that he desires to see."<ref>Richey (1999), p. 271</ref> Journalist Bill Graham believed the song was a bleak account of a failing romance.<ref>Graham (2004), p. 45</ref> ''[[Hot Press]]'' editor [[Niall Stokes]] wrote that the song "takes us back&nbsp;<U+2013> again&nbsp;<U+2013> to the shadowy world of deceit, infidelity, and betrayal. It depicts love at the end, the very end, of its tether. It is as bleak and as despairing a view of the world as you're likely to get, reflecting the emotional climate in which the entire album had been made."<ref name="Stokes" /> He noted, "In terms of its mood, 'Love Is Blindness' had the dark, sensual and decadent feel of pre-war Berlin", adding that the lyric "Love is blindness / I don't want to see" was "a desolate acknowledgement of the terrible reality that it is sometimes better not to know."<ref name="Stokes" />

==Reception==
"Love Is Blindness" was received favourably by critics. ''Uncut'' contributor Gavin Martin rated the song five stars, calling it "rapturous and unsettling."<ref name="Martin" /> ''Hot Press'' editor Niall Stokes said, "its sentiments made it the perfect conclusion to ''Achtung Baby'', describing The Edge's playing as "a mournful, ejaculatory guitar solo, stabbing out thick emotional blues notes that linger and then fall away like tears."<ref name="Stokes" /> ''[[Third Way Magazine|Third Way]]'' reviewer Roland Howard described it as "haunting and melodic", believing it to be about the loss of virginity.<ref>{{cite journal |magazine=[[Third Way Magazine|Third Way]] |first=Roland |last=Howard |page=42 |date=Summer 1992 |volume=15 |issue=6}}</ref> Music journalist Bill Wyman said The Edge's guitar playing on the song sounded like a "dentist's drill".<ref name="ew">{{cite journal |url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,316330,00.html |title=Music Review: Achtung Baby |journal=[[Entertainment Weekly]] |issue=94 |first=Bill |last=Wyman |date=19 November 1991 |accessdate=12 October 2011 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/620MJplwj |archivedate=27 September 2011}}</ref> [[Jon Pareles]] of the ''[[New York Times]]'' described it as "a kind of summation", calling it "an elegy that compares love to 'drowning in a deep well' and wishes for it anyway."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nytimes.com/1991/11/17/arts/recordings-view-u2-takes-a-turn-from-the-universal-to-the-domestic.html?pagewanted=3&src=pm |title=U2 Takes a Turn From the Universal To the Domestic (Page 3) |date=17 November 1991 |first=Jon |last=Pareles |authorlink=Jon Pareles |work=[[New York Times]] |accessdate=12 October 2011 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/620LqE2Ht |archivedate=27 September 2011}}</ref> Geoffrey Himes of ''[[The Washington Post]]'' wrote that it has "a gospel quality, as swooning synth parts are set against block piano chords, and Bono acknowledges that mismatched lovers will suffer their inevitable fate."<ref>{{cite news|title=U2's 'Achtung, Baby': Apocalypse and Heartbreak |url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/projects/stpats/u2.htm |newspaper=[[The Washington Post]] |first=Geoffrey |last=Himes |date=17 November 1991 |page=G6 |accessdate=12 October 2011 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/62O2EFw9Z |archivedate=12 October 2011}}</ref>

==Live performances==
"Love Is Blindness" debuted on 29 February 1992 in Lakeland, Florida, on the opening night of the [[Zoo TV Tour]], where it closed the concert.<ref name="Parra">de la Parra (2003), pp. 140-141</ref> It remained in this position throughout the first and second leg of the tour, with only two concerts concluding with an alternate song&nbsp;<U+2013> "[[With or Without You]]". "Love Is Blindness" was not performed on either of those two occassions.<ref>de la Parra (2003), p. 142</ref> Beginning on the third leg of the tour it was followed by a cover of the [[Elvis Presley]] song "[[Can't Help Falling in Love]]" and, on one occassion, "[[Are You Lonesome Tonight?

The first occasion was on the [[Elevation Tour]]; while performing in Calgary, Alberta, on 10 April 2001, Bono sang a few lines from the song at the conclusion of "[[One (U2 song)|One]]".<ref>de la Parra (2003), p. 232</ref> The final appearance was during a [[Vertigo Tour]] concert in Buenos Aires, Argentina, on 1 March 2006, when U2 performed the song spontaneously to conclude the concert.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.u2gigs.com/show1459.html |title=2006-03-01: River Plate Stadium - Buenos Aires, Argentina |work=U2Gigs.com |first1=Matthias |last1=M<U+00FC>hlbradt |first2=Andr<U+00E9> |last2=Axver |date=1 March 2006 |accessdate=12 October 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last=Cohen |first=Jonathon |title=From Joshua Trees to Palm Trees |date=6 January 2007 |journal=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |volume=119 |issue=1 |issn=0006-2510 |page=17}}</ref>

U2 concert historian Pimm Jal de la Parra called the live rendition "sultry, as the screens show a constellation map, giving the crowd a feeling of floating across the universe by the way it moves, transmitting a mood of distance and loneliness that corresponds with the nature of the song."<ref name="Parra" /> Mark Lepage of ''[[The Gazette (Montreal)|The Gazette]]'' described the dance at the conclusion as "an appropriate moment of human contact after almost two hours of uproar."<ref>{{cite news |title=Headlong U2 raises frenzied roars at Forum; Walls fall between band and fans |first=Mark |last=Lepage |page=1 |date=24 March 1992 |newspaper=[[The Gazette (Montreal)|The Gazette]]}}</ref> Julie Romandetta of the ''[[Boston Herald]]'' believed it to be an anticlimatic finish to the concert, calling the song "low-key" and saying "U2 soared for more than 90 minutes, but left with a whimper, instead of a bang."<ref>{{cite news |title=U2 makes up for lost time.
