===Transfers===
[[Image:MitchMustain-HS.jpg|thumb|right|100px|Mitch Mustain]]

In May, the Trojans were joined by former [[2006 Arkansas Razorbacks football team|Arkansas]] quarterback [[Mitch Mustain]], who was a 8<U+2013>0 win/loss record as a starter during his freshman (and only) year with the team.<ref name=AP052107>[http://sports.espn.go.com/ncf/news/story?id=2878185 Mustain will be eligible to play for USC in '08], Associated Press, May 21, 2007, Accessed May 30, 2008.</ref>  Mustain joined fellow Arkansas teammate and [[wide receiver]] Damian Williams, who transferred from Arkansas before the 2006&nbsp;bowl season. Due to [[NCAA]] transfer rules all would be unable to compete until 2008, although they would be allowed on the [[scout team]].<ref name=AP052107>[http://sports.espn.go.com/ncf/news/story?id=2878185 Mustain will be eligible to play for USC in '08], Associated Press, May 21, 2007, Accessed May 30, 2008.</ref>

In early summer, Jordan Cameron, a former freshman [[basketball]] player from [[Brigham Young University]], also transferred to USC to play football as a wide receiver.<ref name=USCMediaGuide07sec3>[http://www.cstv.com/auto_pdf/p_hotos/s_chools/usc/sports/m-footbl/auto_pdf/07-newcomers 2007 USC Trojans Football Media Guide (Section 3)], USC Athletic Department, July 2007, Accessed May 30, 2008.</ref>  However, when USC refused to accept some of Cameron's credits from Brigham Young, he was forced to withdraw and attend [[Ventura College]].  He missed the football season but was given the option to try and rejoin the team in 2008.  Even if he had stayed at USC, due to NCAA transfer rules he would have been ineligible to play in 2007.<ref name=SBS072607>Scott Wolf, [http://www.sbsun.com/sports/ci_6474499 Trojans busy counting scholarships], ''San Bernardino Sun'', July 26, 2007, Accessed July 26, 2007.</ref>

With the late 2006 dismissal of Troy Van Blarcom (academics) and the death of [[Mario Danelo]], USC was left with only one experienced [[Placekicker|kicker]]:<ref name=WSC072307>Garry Paskwietz, [http://wearesc.com/news/story.php?article=100 Trojans add JC kicker], WeAreSC.com, July 23, 2007, Accessed May 30, 2008.</ref> David Buehler, a 2006&nbsp;[[junior college]] transfer from [[Santa Ana College]] who competed mainly at [[Fullback (American football)|fullback]] and [[Safety (American football)|safety]], but was used for one successful [[Field goal (football)|field goal]] attempt the previous season.<ref name=OCR082307>Mark Saxon, [http://www.ocregister.com/sports/buehler-kicker-danelo-1819399-football-year USC mid-day: More Buehler], ''The Orange County Register'', August 23, 2007, Accessed May 30, 2008.</ref>  In July 2007, Joe Houston, a junior college kicker from [[El Camino College]], joined the team as a "preferred [[Walk-on (sport term)|walk-on]]", guaranteed a non-scholarship spot on the team.<ref name=WSC072307>Garry Paskwietz, [http://wearesc.com/news/story.php?article=100 Trojans add JC kicker], WeAreSC.com, July 23, 2007, Accessed May 30, 2008.</ref>  As a junior college transfer, Houston would be able to  play for the Trojans immediately.  USC also recruited former [[University of Nebraska]] kicker, Jordan Congdon, who was not eligible for the 2007&nbsp;season; and Brad Smith, formerly of [[Davidson College]].  Smith was able to play immediately under an NCAA rule that permits non-scholarship players who have already received a degree to transfer once with immediate eligibility.<ref name=LAT081207>Gary Klein, [http://articles.latimes.com/2007/aug/12/sports/sp-uscrep12 Sanchez is trying to remain positive], ''Los Angeles Times'', August 12, 2007, Accessed July 3, 2008.</ref>

===Departures===
Following the 2006 season, several players graduated, including starting senior All-Americans [[Steve Smith (New York Giants)|Steve Smith]] (wide receiver) and [[Ryan Kalil]] ([[Center (American football)|center]]), as well as all-conference linebackers [[Dallas Sartz]] and [[Oscar Lua]].  Junior All-American [[Dwayne Jarrett]], who was their leading receiver in 2005 and 2006, renounced his eligibility and joined the [[National Football League|NFL]].<ref name=LAT011107a>Gary Klein, [http://articles.latimes.com/2007/jan/11/sports/sp-jarrett11 NFL challenge next for Jarrett], ''Los Angeles Times'', January 11, 2007, Accessed August 4, 2008.</ref>

The Trojans entered fall training camp with a high number of scholarship running backs (10), all of whom were highly touted recruits.  In August, midway through camp, running back [[Emmanuel Moody]] announced he was leaving USC.<ref name=LAT081607a>Gary Klein, [http://articles.latimes.com/2007/aug/16/sports/sp-uscrep16 Tailback Moody to transfer], ''Los Angeles Times'', August 16, 2007, Accessed July 3, 2008.</ref>  Moody, who was the second-leading rusher in the 2006&nbsp;season, had gained 458&nbsp;yards on 79&nbsp;carries in a rotating platoon of running backs in 2006 and had recently been one of three&nbsp;USC running backs appearing on the regional cover of ''Sports Illustrated'''s college football preview edition.<ref name=LAT081607b>Gary Klein, [http://articles.latimes.com/2007/aug/17/sports/sp-usc17 Off the Deep End], ''Los Angeles Times'', August 17, 2007, Accessed July 3, 2008.</ref><ref name=LAT081607a>Gary Klein, [http://articles.latimes.com/2007/aug/16/sports/sp-uscrep16 Tailback Moody to transfer], ''Los Angeles Times'', August 16, 2007, Accessed July 3, 2008.</ref>  Injuries had limited his playing and practice time: he suffered an ankle injury that caused him to miss the team's last four games of the 2006 season, then missed almost all of spring practice due to a hamstring injury.  Halfway through the summer training camp, Moody bruised his knee and was forced to stop practicing.  He wished to be a featured player and stated he had "felt forgotten" coming into training camp due to his recent lack of playing and practice time.<ref name=LAT081607b>Gary Klein, [http://articles.latimes.com/2007/aug/17/sports/sp-usc17 Off the Deep End], ''Los Angeles Times'', August 17, 2007, Accessed July 3, 2008.</ref>  After looking at several schools, including [[Oklahoma State University|Oklahoma State]] and [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill|North Carolina]], Moody transferred to the [[University of Florida]].<ref name=Schad081707>Joe Schad, [http://sports.espn.go.com/ncf/news/story?id=2992872 Moody says he will transfer to Gator country], ESPN.com, August 27, 2007, Accessed May 30, 2008.</ref>

At about the same time, backup receiver and [[Redshirt (college sports)|redshirt]] freshman Jamere Holland was dismissed from the team, although not for any violation of team rules. He was allowed to stay on scholarship for the year. Holland redshirted the previous season after breaking his [[collarbone]], reinjured it during spring practice and had clashed with coaches during his return to fall camp.<ref name=LAT082007>Gary Klein, [http://articles.latimes.com/2007/aug/20/sports/sp-uscrep20 Holland kicked off team], ''Los Angeles Times'', August 20, 2007, Accessed July 3, 2008.</ref><ref name=LAT082107>Gary Klein, [http://articles.latimes.com/2007/aug/21/sports/sp-uscrep21 Carroll dismisses 2006 recruit Holland], ''Los Angeles Times'', August 21, 2007, Accessed July 3, 2008.</ref>

===Offseason news===
On January 6, 2007, Shortly after the Trojans ended their 2006 season with a win at the 2007 Rose Bowl, two-year starting placekicker Mario Danelo was found dead at the bottom of a cliff in [[San Pedro, Los Angeles, California|San Pedro, California]].  Danelo had been expected to start during the 2007&nbsp;season.  For the 2007&nbsp;season, USC players wore a #19&nbsp;sticker on their helmets in honor of Danelo; in addition the Kennedy-Jones practice field had the number "19" sprayed onto its end zones and the Coliseum hung a banner above the player's tunnel with Danelo's name and also paid tribute to him on the goal-post pads.<ref name=LADN081207>Scott Wolf, [http://www.dailynews.com/sports/ci_6603945 USC freshman end Griffen gains reputation], ''Daily News'', August 12, 2007, ''Accessed August 12, 2007''.</ref><ref name=LAT032607>Gary Klein, [http://articles.latimes.com/2007/mar/26/sports/sp-uscfb26 Danelo's parents visit during practice], ''Los Angeles Times'', March 26, 2007, Accessed July 3, 2008.</ref>

[[Image:2008-0808-USC19-SteveSarkisian.jpg|right|thumb|Sarkisian took over as Offensive Coordinator after Kiffin's departure.]]
The Trojans lost their offensive coordinator, [[Lane Kiffin]], on January 23, [[2007 in sports|2007]], when he was hired to  be the new head coach of the [[Oakland Raiders]]; the 31-year-old Kiffin became the youngest head coach in Raiders history, and the youngest head coach since the formation of the modern NFL.<ref>[http://www.usatoday.com/sports/football/nfl/raiders/2007-01-22-kiffin-hiring_x.htm Raiders tab USC's Lane Kiffin to be next head coach], Associated Press, January 22, 2007, Accessed May 30, 2008.</ref> The following week, Pete Carroll named [[Steve Sarkisian]] as his team's new offensive coordinator.  Sarkisian had interviewed with the Raiders for their vacant head coach position but withdrew from the process to stay at USC, where he had been the assistant head coach and quarterbacks coach.<ref>Steve Corkran, [http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4176/is_20070119/ai_n17146773 Sarkisian turns down Raiders offer], ''Oakland Tribune'', January 19, 2007, Accessed May 30, 2008.</ref>

Intra-conference controversy arose in March 2007, when Stanford coach [[Jim Harbaugh]] was quoted as saying "<nowiki>[Pete Carroll]</nowiki>'s only got one&nbsp;more year, though. He'll be there one&nbsp;more year. That's what I've heard. I heard it inside the staff."<ref name=miller/>  Upon further questions, Harbaugh claimed he had heard it from staff at USC.<ref name=miller>Ted Miller, [http://sports.espn.go.com/ncf/news/story?id=2828014 Spring look around the Pac-10], ESPN.com, April 6, 2007, Accessed May 30, 2008.</ref>  At the Pac-10 Conference media day (July 26, 2007), Harbaugh praised the Trojans, stating "There is no question in my mind that USC is the best team in the country and may be the best team in the history of college football"; the declaration, especially in light of his earlier comment, garnered more media attention.<ref name=AP072607>[http://sports.espn.go.com/ncf/news/story?id=2950724 Trojans top preseason poll for fifth straight year], Associated Press, July 26, 2007.</ref><ref name=LAT072607>Eric Sondheimer, Gary Klein, Chris Foster, [http://articles.latimes.com/2007/jul/27/sports/sp-pacmedia27 Pac-10 coaches come not to bury the Trojans but praise them], ''Los Angeles Times'', July 27, 2007, Accessed July 3, 2008.</ref><ref name=ESPN072707forde>Pat Forde, [http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/columns/story?columnist=forde_pat&id=2950530&sportCat=ncf Harbaugh declaration delivers Pac-10 jolt], ESPN.com, July 27, 2007, Accessed May 30, 2008.</ref>

In early July, LSU coach [[Les Miles]] stirred inter-conference controversy when he publicly criticized USC's 2007&nbsp;schedule in front of LSU boosters; though the two&nbsp;schools had not played each other since 1984, the LSU Tiger faithful maintained a strong grudge against the Trojans after they shared the national title in the controversial [[2003 NCAA Division I-A football season|2003&nbsp;season]].<ref name=SI070607>Stewart Mandel, [http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2007/writers/stewart_mandel/07/06/miles.usc/index.html Better Les unsaid], SI.com, July 6, 2007, Accessed May 30, 2008.</ref>  LSU and Michigan were ranked as the pre-season No.&nbsp;2&nbsp;team in various polls.  Coincidentally, by week five of the 2007&nbsp;season, there were questions as to whether USC's schedule was actually harder than LSU's, given their opponents' early-season performances.<ref name=ESPN092407ms>Mark Schlabach, [http://sports.espn.go.com/ncf/columns/story?columnist=schlabach_mark&id=3033817 Script might be flipped for SEC, Pac-10 for this season], ESPN.com, September 24, 2007, Accessed May 30, 2008.</ref><ref name=ESPN101007>Ted Miller, [http://sports.espn.go.com/ncf/news/story?id=3057109 Looks good on paper, but Pac-10 midseason arrives with thud], ESPN.com, October 10, 2007, Accessed May 30, 2008.</ref>

USC opened its season hosting the [[University of Idaho]] [[Idaho Vandals|Vandals]] of the [[Western Athletic Conference]], under first&nbsp;year coach [[Robb Akey]].  Trojans Defensive Coordinator Nick Holt had previously been the head coach of the Idaho Vandals between 2004<U+2013>2005; before that he was USC's linebackers coach from 2001 to 2003 under Carroll.

Booty completed 21 of 32&nbsp;passes for 206&nbsp;yards, threw for three&nbsp;touchdowns and one&nbsp;interception; though he did not convert on a fourth&nbsp;down play in short yardage and was unable to find a rhythm.<ref name=LAT090207b>Bill Plaschke, [http://articles.latimes.com/2007/sep/02/sports/sp-plaschke2 the season could be a blast], ''Los Angeles Times'', September 2, 2007, Accessed May 30, 2008.</ref>  Primary receiver Patrick Turner was held out of the game to recover from a [[Stinger (medicine)|stinger]] received in the previous week's practice; cornerback Josh Pinkard was also held out to recover from knee soreness.  As a result, young receivers David Ausberry and Vidal Hazelton handled the primary wide receiver duties.<ref name=LAT090207a>Gary Klein, [http://articles.latimes.com/2007/sep/02/sports/sp-usc2 Sputter step for USC], ''Los Angeles Times'', September 2, 2007, Accessed May 30, 2008.</ref>  The highlight of the Trojans offense was the running game, which rushed for 214&nbsp;yards while Idaho was held to 98.  The role was run by committee: with the debut of redshirt freshman Stafon Johnson (64&nbsp;yards in 12&nbsp;carries, two&nbsp;touchdown runs), who scored the first&nbsp;touchdown of the game, as well as C.J. Gable (68&nbsp;yards in eight&nbsp;carries, one&nbsp;touchdown reception), who made an impressive 33-yard run, and fullback Stanley Havili who made several receptions, including one for a touchdown. The game marked the debut of USC true freshman running back Joe McKnight, who made a spectacular run in the third&nbsp;quarter that was likened to those of predecessor [[Reggie Bush]].<ref name=LAT090207b>Bill Plaschke, [http://articles.latimes.com/2007/sep/02/sports/sp-plaschke2 With these tailbacks, this season could be a blast], ''Los Angeles Times'', September 2, 2007, Accessed May 30, 2008.</ref>  Kristofer O'Dowd became the first&nbsp;true freshman to start at center for the Trojans due to an injury to Matt Spanos, earning positive reviews for his performance.<ref name=LAT090207c>Eric Sondheimer, [http://articles.latimes.com/2007/sep/02/sports/sp-uscside2 He is the center of attention], ''Los Angeles Times'', September 2, 2007, Accessed May 30, 2008.</ref><ref name=LAT090307>Gary Klein, [http://articles.latimes.com/2007/sep/03/sports/sp-uscrep3 Opener goes as expected], ''Los Angeles Times'', September 3, 2007, Accessed May 30, 2008.</ref>  Although the defense did not cause many turnovers and lost key linebacker Brian Cushing to an ankle sprain in the first&nbsp;quarter, it met enough expectations to remain ranked among the top defenses in the country.<ref name=ESPN090307>Bruce Feldman, [http://sports.espn.go.com/ncf/columns/story?columnist=feldman_bruce&id=3003092 LSU, Virginia Tech should be great defensive matchup], ''ESPN the Magazine'', September 3, 2007, Accessed May 30, 2008.</ref>

In honor of Trojans kicker Mario Danelo, who died just after the 2006&nbsp;season, a special ceremony was held before the beginning of the game.  Also, after scoring its first&nbsp;touchdown, USC intentionally lined up for the [[Extra point|PAT]] without a kicker in tribute to their late teammate, taking a 5-yard [[delay of game]] penalty before David Buehler came on the field to kick the extra point.<ref name=LAT090207d>Gary Klein, [http://articles.latimes.com/2007/sep/02/sports/sp-uscrep2 Danelo is paid a tribute], ''Los Angeles Times'', September 2, 2007, Accessed July 2, 2008.</ref>  The moment was chosen by ESPN as one of the Pac-10's Top 10&nbsp;Moments Of BCS Era.<ref name=ESPN052208>Ted Miller, [http://sports.espn.go.com/ncf/news/story?id=3406111 Trojans had no BCS peer once Carroll arrived], ESPN.com, May 22, 2008, Accessed May 22, 2008.</ref>

After a [[Bye (sports)|bye week]], the Trojans visited the Nebraska Cornhuskers in Lincoln, Nebraska.  In the pre-season, the game was named as one of the candidates for the 10&nbsp;most important games of 2007.  For the Huskers, the game was especially critical to their hopes of showing progress under 4th&nbsp;year head coach [[Bill Callahan (football coach)|Bill Callahan]].<ref name=Mandel062107>Stewart Mandel, [http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2007/writers/stewart_mandel/06/21/10.games/index.html Momentous matchups], SI.com, June 21, 2007, Accessed May 30, 2008.</ref><ref name=ESPN081507z>David Duffey, [http://sports.espn.go.com/ncf/preview07/news/story?id=2975519 Don't miss these nonconference games in 2007], ESPN.com, August 15, 2007, Accessed May 30, 2008.</ref>  The game marks the first time a No.&nbsp;1-ranked team has visited Lincoln since 1978.<ref name=OWH091107>[http://www.omaha.com/index.php?u_page=1200&u_sid=10129102 Guest List: Huskers' toughest opponents in Memorial Stadium], ''Omaha World-Herald'', September 11, 2007, Accessed May 30, 2008.</ref>  Because of the game's significance, [[ESPN]] ''[[College GameDay (football)|College GameDay]]'' chose it as the site of its weekly broadcast.<ref name=Huskers090907>[http://www.huskers.com/ViewArticle.dbml?SPSID=1&SPID=22&DB_OEM_ID=100&ATCLID=1210857 Live from Lincoln . . .

Callahan had been criticized for his conservative play-calling during the 2006&nbsp;game in Los Angeles; instead of playing to win, it appeared the Huskers were playing to not get blown out by the then-favored Trojans.  In that game the normally prolific [[West Coast offense]] of Nebraska, which had produced 541&nbsp;yards a game, was corralled on the ground and attempted only 17&nbsp;passes in a 28<U+2013>10 Husker loss.  For 2007, Callahan pledged to play more aggressively, using running back [[Marlon Lucky]] and quarterback [[Sam Keller]].<ref name=LAT091507b>Gary Klein, [http://articles.latimes.com/2007/sep/15/sports/sp-usc15 USC vs. the Red Sea], ''Los Angeles Times'', September 15, 2007, Accessed July 2, 2008.</ref>  Keller, the Huskers redshirt senior starting quarterback, was a 2006&nbsp;transfer from Arizona State; as a Sun Devil Keller started the first seven&nbsp;games of his 2005&nbsp;junior season, throwing for 2,165&nbsp;yards, before a disastrous game against USC where, after leading ASU to a 21<U+2013>3 halftime lead, he and the offense fell apart on the way to a 38<U+2013>28 loss where he was sacked five&nbsp;times and threw five&nbsp;interceptions.<ref name=CSTV082107>Carolyn Braff, [http://www.cstv.com/sports/m-footbl/stories/082107aak.html Running A Reverse], CSTV.com, August 21, 2007, Accessed July 2, 2008.</ref>  Due to NCAA transfer rules, Keller spent the 2006 season on the Huskers' scout team.

The Trojans stayed in nearby [[Omaha, Nebraska|Omaha]] and practiced at a local high school; Carroll took the rare step of closing practice to outsiders after a local radio station announced the location.<ref name=LAT091507a>Gary Klein, [http://articles.latimes.com/2007/sep/15/sports/sp-uscrep15 Trojans have a hidden agenda in enemy territory], ''Los Angeles Times'', September 15, 2007, Accessed July 2, 2008.</ref>  The game marked the return of primary receiver Patrick Turner and running back Chauncey Washington from injury; linebacker Brian Cushing, who injured his ankle early against Idaho, had not fully recovered but was allowed to suit-up as a reserve.<ref name=LAT091407b>Gary Klein, [http://articles.latimes.com/2007/sep/14/sports/sp-uscrep14 Receivers eager to play on big stage], ''Los Angeles Times'', September 14, 2007, Accessed July 2, 2008.</ref>  Senior center Matt Spanos remained injured, and true freshman Kris O'Dowd was called to start again.  Veteran [[Defensive back|secondary]] member Josh Pinkard was lost for the season after his sore knee gave out during a bye week practice, resulting in a torn [[anterior cruciate ligament|ACL]] requiring surgery.<ref name=LAT091207b>Gary Klein, [http://articles.latimes.com/2007/sep/12/sports/sp-uscrep12 Pinkard to again miss the season], ''Los Angeles Times'', September 12, 2007, Accessed July 2, 2008.</ref>

The Trojans did not escape injuries, as linebacker Clay Matthews, substituting for the recovering Brian Cushing, broke his thumb, causing Cushing to enter the game as his replacement.  The Trojans also suffered two&nbsp;injuries on kick returns: fullback Alfred Rowe suffered a mild [[concussion]], and there was a moment of worry when returner Vincent Joseph, after being tackled and fumbling the ball, lay on the turf for over 10&nbsp;minutes before being removed by stretcher with a bruised [[larynx]] and a neck sprain, but no serious injuries.<ref name=LAT091807>Gary Klein, [http://articles.latimes.com/2007/sep/18/sports/sp-uscrep18 Injury scary but not serious for Joseph], ''Los Angeles Times'', September 18, 2007, Accessed July 2, 2008.</ref><ref name=LAT091607dwgkx1>David Wharton and Gary Klein, [http://articles.latimes.com/2007/sep/18/sports/sp-uscrep18 Johnson goes the extra yards ], ''Los Angeles Times'', September 16, 2007, Accessed August 15, 2008.</ref> Linebacker Rey Maualuga was flagged during a field goal attempt for the rarely called penalty of "disconcerting", which is given for "words or signals that disconcert opponents when they are preparing to put the ball in play".<ref>Ivan Maisel, [http://sports.espn.go.com/ncf/notebook?page=iform074 Dome dispute, directional debate and gurus gone bad], ESPN.com, September 19, 2007, Accessed July 2, 2008.</ref><ref name=NYT091607>Vahl Gregorian, [http://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/16/sports/ncaafootball/16nebraska.html Trojans Leave No Doubts by Taking It to Cornhuskers], ''The New York Times'', September 16, 2007, Accessed July 10, 2008.</ref><ref name=NCAAfbrules2008>NCAA Football Rule 7-1, Article 5(a)(3): "No player shall use words or signals that disconcert opponents when they are preparing to put the ball in play.

USC opened Pac-10 conference play by hosting the Washington State Cougars. Entering the game, Trojans quarterback John David Booty and the receiver corp remained unproven after an uninspiring performance against Idaho and a run-dominated game against Nebraska.  Hoping to take advantage, Washington State elected to go into the game using a man-to-man pass coverage to allow more focus on stopping the Trojans running game.<ref name=LAT092207b>Lonnie White, [http://articles.latimes.com/2007/sep/22/sports/spw-xandos22 Washington State's man-to-man gamble], ''Los Angeles Times'', September 22, 2007, Accessed July 2, 2008.</ref>  The Cougars had given the then-No.&nbsp;3&nbsp;Trojans a scare in their 2006&nbsp;meeting, with the game coming down to the final seconds.<ref name=AP100106>Gregg Bell, [http://sports.yahoo.com/ncaaf/recap?gid=200609300066 (3) USC 28, Washington St. 22], Associated Press, October 1, 2006, Accessed July 2, 2008.</ref>

In the end, USC routed the Cougars 47<U+2013>14, with a primarily aerial attack.  Booty reestablished his presence, completing 28 of 35&nbsp;passes for 279&nbsp;yards and four&nbsp;touchdowns before leaving the game early in the fourth&nbsp;quarter.

Junior cornerback Cary Harris dislocated his right shoulder during the game and was replaced by Shareece Wright.  Linebacker Brian Cushing reinjured the ankle he sprained in the opener against Idaho.  Sixth-year senior running back Hershel Dennis played for the first time since the 2004&nbsp;season during the fourth&nbsp;quarter, gaining 14&nbsp;yards in four&nbsp;carries; he had sat out the two&nbsp;previous seasons due to injury.<ref name=LAT092307a>Gary Klein, [http://articles.latimes.com/2007/sep/23/sports/sp-uscrep23 Secondary's latest casualty is Harris], ''Los Angeles Times'', September 23, 2007, Accessed July 2, 2008.</ref>

In a day where half of the week's top-10 teams were defeated, USC escaped becoming the sixth in a messy, mistake-prone 27<U+2013>24 victory in a wet, windy game in Seattle.  Although USC had a 460<U+2013>190 edge in total yards, their errors helped the Huskies significantly; they committed three&nbsp;turnovers and 16&nbsp;penalties<U+2014>their most in more than two&nbsp;seasons<U+2014>for 161&nbsp;yards, missed a field goal and had a punt blocked.<ref name=AP093007>Gregg Bell, [http://sports.yahoo.com/ncaaf/recap?gid=200709290065 (1) USC 27, Washington 24], Associated Press, [[September 30, 2007]], Accessed July 3, 2008.</ref><ref name=LAT093007x>David Wharton, [http://articles.latimes.com/2007/sep/30/sports/sp-uscside30 Trojans able to win despite themselves], ''Los Angeles Times'', September 30, 2007, Accessed July 3, 2008.</ref>  A disappointed Pete Carroll noted "We just couldn't do more things wrong in the game <nowiki>[. . .]</nowiki> I thought Washington was there for it.

USC quarterback John David Booty completed 20 of 37&nbsp;passes for 236&nbsp;yards and a touchdown but had two&nbsp;interceptions, one of which was returned 54&nbsp;yards for a touchdown tying the game at 14<U+2013>14 in the second&nbsp;quarter.  The Huskies gained momentum early in the fourth&nbsp;quarter when they came to within 24<U+2013>17 and forced USC to punt; however, on the return, Terrell Thomas stripped the ball from Anthony Russo for a fumble and recovered at the Huskies' 43&nbsp;yard line, setting up David Buehler's 33-yard field goal with 3:01 remaining.  The Huskies did not give up, and blocked a USC punt with 1:15 left and scored on quarterback Jake Locker's one-yard run to pull to within three with 34&nbsp;seconds left.  On the ensuing [[onside kick]], Thomas was able to recover the ball for USC, ending the game.<ref name=LAT093007a>Gary Klein, [http://articles.latimes.com/2007/sep/30/sports/sp-usc30 Trojans win on flag day], ''Los Angeles Times'', September 30, 2007, Accessed July 3, 2008.</ref>

[[Image:091507-USCNeb-ChiloRachal2.jpg|thumb|right|Offensive guard Chilo Rachal was one of several key players who suffered injuries in the game.]]

Washington quarterback Locker displayed the dual passing/running threat Carroll had expressed concern about, but also showed his youth with erratic passing, finishing 12-for-27 with 83&nbsp;yards passing and one&nbsp;interception, plus another 50&nbsp;yards on 16&nbsp;carries with two&nbsp;touchdowns.  USC did have positive showings in the running game, with Stafon Johnson running for 122&nbsp;yards and a touchdown and Chauncey Washington also adding 106&nbsp;yards and a score.<ref name=AP093007>Gregg Bell, [http://sports.yahoo.com/ncaaf/recap?gid=200709290065 (1) USC 27, Washington 24], Associated Press, [[September 30, 2007]], Accessed July 3, 2008.</ref>  In the end, Carroll and the Trojans described the game as less a victory than an escape, a game where USC's raw athleticism took advantage of Washington's youth.<ref name=LAT093007bp>Bill Plaschke, [http://articles.latimes.com/2007/sep/30/sports/sp-plaschke30 Trojans almost beat themselves but find a way to escape with victory], ''Los Angeles Times'', September 30, 2007, Accessed July 3, 2008.</ref>

The Trojans suffered numerous injuries during the game: starting freshman center Kristofer O'Dowd hurt his [[kneecap]] and guard Chilo Rachal sprained his knee on the same play in the first&nbsp;quarter; they were replaced by senior center Matt Spanos, who had just been cleared for play after tearing a [[triceps]] before the season, and reserve guard Alatini Malu.

Harbaugh made headlines prior to the season by claiming 2007 would be Carroll's last year with USC before departing to the NFL, drawing a terse rebuke from Carroll; Harbaugh later called the 2007&nbsp;Trojans one of the best teams in history at the Pac-10 Media Day, reiterating the position in the week before their game.<ref name=LAT100607>Gary Klein, [http://articles.latimes.com/2007/oct/06/sports/sp-usc6 Trojans playing role of the heavy], ''Los Angeles Times'', October 6, 2007, Accessed July 3, 2008.</ref> However, there were no hard feelings between the coaches.

There were a few positive efforts for the Trojans: Tight end Fred Davis caught five&nbsp;passes for a career-best 152&nbsp;yards, including a 63-yard touchdown; and nose tackle Sedrick Ellis had three&nbsp;sacks.  However, there were many more errors and substandard performances: quarterback John David Booty, who broke a bone in the middle finger of his throwing hand in the first&nbsp;half, had four&nbsp;passes intercepted in the second&nbsp;half.  The offensive line had been suffering since losing two&nbsp;starters in one&nbsp;play during the previous week's game at Washington, but the effect was severe against Stanford; the offensive line gave up four&nbsp;sacks, one more than the Trojans had surrendered all season, and USC gained only 95&nbsp;yards rushing.  Key receiver Patrick Turner dropped several passes, the defense gave up 17&nbsp;points in the fourth&nbsp;quarter and USC had an extra-point attempt blocked, a point which became a crucial difference.  Like their previous game against Washington, USC out-gained Stanford by 224&nbsp;yards (459 to 235) but made many crucial turnovers and penalties.<ref name=LAT100807a>Gary Klein, [http://articles.latimes.com/2007/oct/08/sports/sp-uscrewind8 The shock hasn't worn off yet], ''Los Angeles Times'', October 8, 2007, Accessed July 3, 2008.</ref><ref name=LAT100807x>Gary Klein, [http://articles.latimes.com/2007/oct/08/sports/sp-usc8 USC<U+2019>s big slip throws the city for a loss], ''Los Angeles Times'', October 8, 2007, Accessed July 3, 2008.</ref>  In the press conference following the game, Coach Carroll summarized his concerns: "It's real clear that we have fallen out of line with our philosophy that has guided this program for years; we're turning the ball over too much."<ref name=LAT100807a>Gary Klein, [http://articles.latimes.com/2007/oct/08/sports/sp-uscrewind8 The shock hasn't worn off yet], ''Los Angeles Times'', October 8, 2007, Accessed July 3, 2008.</ref>

In an interview the following month, Carroll assessed the mistakes that led to the loss as his own:
{{Bquote|We really blew it against Stanford. We screwed it up because we played a guy that was hurt. I made a mistake on that. That was me. ... If anything really was a factor, it was my cockiness that there was no way we could lose a game.

[[Image:091507-USCNeb-MarkSanchez v2.jpg|upright|thumb|left|In his first game as starting quarterback, Mark Sanchez overcame first&nbsp;half inconsistencies with a strong second&nbsp;half performance.]]

The Trojans again showed inconsistency for most of the game before coming alive in the fourth&nbsp;quarter and pulling away to a 20<U+2013>13 victory.  USC started out well, going ahead 10<U+2013>0 in the second&nbsp;quarter after running back Chauncey Washington's 18-yard touchdown run and David Buehler's 27-yard field goal.  However, the offense began to sputter; the Trojans amassed only 12&nbsp;total yards in the second&nbsp;quarter and 50 in the third.  Part of the offense's problems were turnovers; Sanchez threw two&nbsp;interceptions in the second&nbsp;quarter, allowing Arizona to tie the game going into halftime.  The Wildcats kicked another field goal early in the third&nbsp;quarter to go up 13<U+2013>10, raising speculation that USC was going to be upset for the second&nbsp;consecutive week.  The momentum of the game quickly changed in the fourth&nbsp;quarter after freshman running back Joe McKnight, touted as the next great Trojans tailback but yet to meet expectations, made a 45-yard punt return that Sanchez followed up on the next play with a 25-yard touchdown pass to tight end Fred Davis.  After a defensive stop, Arizona punter Keenyn Crier kicked an 83-yard punt to the Trojans one-yard line.  The Trojans pushed forward with fullback Stanley Havili before McKnight again made a big play, running 59&nbsp;yards and setting up what would be a Trojans field goal.  The USC defense then forced an Arizona turn-over on downs to preserve the victory.<ref name=LAT101407gk-sum>Gary Klein, [http://articles.latimes.com/2007/oct/14/sports/sp-usc14 McKnight zigs, USC zags], ''Los Angeles Times'', October 14, 2007, Accessed July 3, 2008.</ref><ref name=AP101307jn>John Nadel, [http://sports.yahoo.com/ncaaf/recap;_ylt=Aqqx2uSwSf71LJ9tss_cMcXwvbYF?gid=200710130062 (10) USC 20, Arizona 13], October 13, 2007, Accessed July 3, 2008.</ref>  Sanchez recovered from his poor first&nbsp;half performance with a strong performance in the second, where he completed 11 of 15&nbsp;passes for 74&nbsp;yards and a touchdown while later making a key 10-yard scramble on third and seven late in the fourth&nbsp;quarter.<ref name=LAT101407bb-san>Ben Bloch, [http://articles.latimes.com/2007/oct/14/sports/sp-uscside14 Sanchez overcomes shaky start for USC], ''Los Angeles Times'', October 14, 2007, Accessed July 3, 2008.</ref>

With starting quarterback John David Booty still recovering from a broken finger on his throwing hand, USC elected to start Mark Sanchez for the second&nbsp;straight week.  On the Thursday night before the game, the Trojans [[charter flight]] experienced severe turbulence on approach to [[South Bend Regional Airport]] during a [[lightning storm]]; their aircraft dropped and threw several passengers (players, coaches and their spouses) from their seats and hit their heads on the ceiling during an initial approach that was aborted before the plane circled and landed safely.<ref name=LAT101907gk>Gary Klein, [http://articles.latimes.com/2007/oct/19/sports/sp-uscrep19 Team has bad flight arrival], ''Los Angeles Times'', October 19, 2007, Accessed July 3, 2008.</ref>

Breaking with tradition, the Fighting Irish announced in June that they would be wearing their alternative green jerseys instead of blue against USC; Notre Dame Coach [[Charlie Weis]] noted that it was in honor of the 1977&nbsp;Irish team that switched to green jerseys before defeating the Trojans en route to a national championship (Weis was a student at Notre Dame at the time).

The Trojans dominated the game, shutting out Notre Dame 38<U+2013>0, USC's largest margin of victory in the series.  Quarterback Mark Sanchez made significant improvements over the previous week, completing 21 of 38 passes for 235&nbsp;yards and four&nbsp;touchdowns and no interceptions.  There were several highlight plays: Tight end Fred Davis made a one-handed touchdown catch in the first&nbsp;quarter, wide receiver Vidal Hazelton made a 48-yard touchdown run after evading several Irish defenders, and freshman running back Joe McKnight made a 51-yard fourth&nbsp;quarter run for his first&nbsp;touchdown.  The USC defense stifled the Irish offense: allowing only 165&nbsp;yards to the Trojans' 462&nbsp;yards, making five&nbsp;sacks, and keeping the Irish from rushing for a first&nbsp;down until the fourth&nbsp;quarter.  There were several special teams miscues: The Irish blocked a USC punt, the Trojans blocked a 40-yard field goal attempt and the Irish had a fumbled punt return recovered by USC.  The Trojans had several key players return from injuries and make significant contributions, including linebacker Brian Cushing and running back Stafon Johnson.<ref name=LAT102107gk1>Gary Klein, [http://articles.latimes.com/2007/oct/21/sports/sp-usc21 Heroes and zeros for Trojans], ''Los Angeles Times'', October 21, 2007, Accessed July 3, 2008.</ref><ref name=LAT102107bb>Ben Bolch, [http://articles.latimes.com/2007/oct/21/sports/sp-uscside21 Defense plays like Trojans of old], ''Los Angeles Times'', October 21, 2007, Accessed July 3, 2008.</ref><ref name=LAT102107gkbb>Gary Klein and Ben Bolch, [http://articles.latimes.com/2007/oct/21/sports/sp-uscrep21 Cushing<U+2019>s return a mood-lifter for Trojans<U+2019> defense], ''Los Angeles Times'', October 21, 2007, Accessed July 3, 2008.</ref>

The Trojans trailed 10<U+2013>3 going into halftime, but tied the game in the third&nbsp;quarter on a Sanchez to Patrick Turner touchdown pass.  However, on the next possession, fullback Stanley Havili fumbled the ball and Oregon recovered on the USC 16&nbsp;yard line, leading to an Oregon touchdown.  On USC's next series, Sanchez threw an interception.  During the Trojans' following series, Oregon safety Matthew Harper intercepted a pass and returned it 27&nbsp;yards to the Oregon&nbsp;42.

The USC defense forced an Oregon three-and-out and starting at their 17, the Trojans advanced to Oregon's 33 with 26&nbsp;seconds left.

Oregon State entered the game with the nation's best rushing defense, allowing only 54.5&nbsp;yards rushing a game  and also recording a nation-leading 34&nbsp;sacks.

In a strong defensive performance, the Trojans defeated the Beavers 24<U+2013>3.  The USC defense made nine&nbsp;sacks and intercepted a pass; they limited Oregon State to 176&nbsp;total yards and a field goal off a Trojans fumble in the USC red zone.  True freshman Everson Griffen had 3<U+00BD>&nbsp;sacks, safety Kevin Ellison added two, end Lawrence Jackson had 1<U+00BD> and nose tackle Sedrick Ellis and linebacker Brian Cushing had one each; cornerback Terrell Thomas made the interception.  The Trojans offense had its second lowest total of the season, gaining 287&nbsp;yards, but it rushed for 100&nbsp;yards against the Beavers' tight rush defense, led by Chauncey Washington who gained 60&nbsp;yards in 12&nbsp;carries.  Booty, returning from injury, could not find his rhythm but still completed 19 of 33&nbsp;passes for 157&nbsp;yards without an interception; the Trojans converted only five of 16&nbsp;third downs.  Both teams missed field goals in the first&nbsp;quarter, then exchanged field goals going into the second&nbsp;quarter.  The Trojans then scored 21&nbsp;unanswered points in less than eight&nbsp;minutes to close the half.  Neither team scored in the second&nbsp;half.

During the 2006&nbsp;contest, UCLA Defensive Coordinator [[DeWayne Walker]] had the Bruins apply aggressive pressure to John David Booty, limiting the quarterback's ability to drive the passing game while holding the Trojans to 55&nbsp;yards rushing and an average of only 1.9&nbsp;yards per carry.

Rucker, a linebacker from [[Moreno Valley, California|Moreno Valley]], drowned during the summer before his freshman year with USC (and was honored during the 2004&nbsp;season) and Danelo died from a fatal fall immediately following the 2006&nbsp;season; members of both families attended.

The Trojans defense dominated the Bruins in a 24<U+2013>7 victory before a sold-out Coliseum crowd.  The Trojans held the Bruins to a season-low 168&nbsp;yards, sacking quarterback Patrick Cowan four&nbsp;times for 31&nbsp;yards in losses and held the Bruins to 12&nbsp;net rushing yards. USC forced four&nbsp;turnovers, recovering three&nbsp;UCLA fumbles and intercepting a pass.  The Bruins did not convert any of its 11&nbsp;third&nbsp;down situations.  The Bruins sole score came in a drive in the closing minutes of the first&nbsp;half.  USC gained 231&nbsp;rushing yards and 437&nbsp;overall.  On the ground, running back Joe McKnight rushed for 89&nbsp;yards and a touchdown, Stafon Johnson ran for 73&nbsp;yards and senior Chauncey Washington gained 66&nbsp;yards and scored a touchdown.

The victory assured USC a share of the Pac-10 title.  Although Arizona State would defeat Arizona later in the night to become co-champions, the Trojans clinched a berth in the Rose Bowl by virtue of their victory over the Sun Devils the previous week.

The Trojans ended the 2007&nbsp;season by participating in the [[2008 Rose Bowl]], held on [[New Year's Day]] in the Rose Bowl stadium in Pasadena, California; it was the Trojans' fourth&nbsp;Rose Bowl game and sixth&nbsp;[[BCS Bowl]] in six&nbsp;years.  Although it traditionally hosts the champions of the [[Big Ten Conference|Big Ten]] and Pac-10 conferences, the 2007&nbsp;Big Ten Champion, [[2007 Ohio State Buckeyes football team|Ohio State]], was ranked No.&nbsp;1 in the final BCS poll and instead participated in the [[2008 BCS National Championship Game]].  The rules governing BCS bowl selections allowed the Rose Bowl to select a BCS "at-large" team from the top 14&nbsp;teams ranked in the BCS Standings that have at least nine&nbsp;wins.  Keeping with its traditional bowl ties, the Rose Bowl selected the No.&nbsp;13-ranked Illinois Fighting Illini (9<U+2013>3), under third-year head coach [[Ron Zook]].<ref name=LAT120307>Gary Klein, [http://articles.latimes.com/2007/dec/03/sports/sp-rose3 USC-Illinois accents Rose Bowl tradition], ''Los Angeles Times'', December 3, 2007, Accessed July 7, 2008.</ref>
