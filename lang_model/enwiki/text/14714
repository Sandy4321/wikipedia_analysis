'''Ununpentium''' is the temporary name of a [[synthetic element|synthetic]] [[superheavy element]] in the [[periodic table]] that has the temporary symbol '''Uup''' and has the [[atomic number]] 115. It is an extremely [[radioactive]] element; its most stable known isotope, ununpentium-289, has a [[half-life]] of only 220&nbsp;[[millisecond]]s.<ref name=e117>{{cite doi|10.1103/PhysRevLett.104.142502}}</ref> It is also known as [[Mendeleev's predicted elements|eka]]-[[bismuth]] or simply '''element 115'''. Ununpentium was first created in 2003 by the [[Joint Institute for Nuclear Research]] in [[Dubna]], Russia, although this discovery is still awaiting confirmation by [[International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry|IUPAC]]. About 50 atoms of ununpentium have been observed to date, all of which have been shown to have mass numbers from 287 to 290.

In the [[periodic table]], it is a [[p-block]] [[transactinide element]]. It is a member of the [[period 7 element|7th period]] and is placed in group 15 as the heaviest [[pnictogen]], although it has not been confirmed to behave as the heavier [[homology (chemistry)|homologue]] to the pnictogen bismuth. Ununpentium is calculated to have some similar properties to its lighter homologues, [[nitrogen]], [[phosphorus]], [[arsenic]], [[antimony]], and [[bismuth]], although it should also show several major differences from them.

The Dubna<U+2013>Livermore collaboration has strengthened their claim for the discoveries of ununpentium and ununtrium by conducting chemical experiments on the final [[decay product]] <sup>268</sup>Db. This was valuable as none of the nuclides in this decay chain were previously known, so that their claim was not supported by any previously obtained experimental data (as none existed), and chemical experimentation would strengthen the case for their claim. In June 2004 and again in December 2005, this [[dubnium]] isotope was successfully identified by extracting the final decay products, measuring [[spontaneous fission]] (SF) activities and using chemical identification techniques to confirm that they behave like a [[group 5 element]] (as dubnium is known to be in group 5 of the periodic table).<ref name=Haire/><ref name=e115/> Both the half-life and decay mode were confirmed for the proposed <sup>268</sup>Db which lends support to the assignment of the parent nucleus to ununpentium.<ref name=e115>[http://www.jinr.ru/publish/Preprints/2004/157(e12-2004-157).pdf "Results of the experiment on chemical identification of Db as a decay product of element 115"], Oganessian et al., JINR preprints, 2004.

===Naming===
Ununpentium is the second-lightest element that has not yet received an official name. Using [[Mendeleev's predicted elements|Mendeleev's nomenclature for unnamed and undiscovered elements]], ununpentium is sometimes known as ''eka-[[bismuth]]''. In 1979 IUPAC recommended that the [[placeholder|placeholder]] [[systematic element name]] ''ununpentium'' (with the corresponding symbol of ''Uup'')<ref name=iupac>{{cite journal|author=Chatt, J.|journal=Pure Appl. Chem.|year=1979|volume=51|pages=381<U+2013>384|title=Recommendations for the Naming of Elements of Atomic Numbers Greater than 100|doi=10.1351/pac197951020381|issue=2}}</ref> be used until the discovery of the element is confirmed and a name is decided on. These recommendations are largely ignored among scientists, who call it "element 115", with the symbol of ''(115)'' or even simply ''115''.<ref name="Haire"/>

===Road to confirmation===
Two heavier isotopes of ununpentium, <sup>289</sup>Uup and <sup>290</sup>Uup, were discovered in 2009<U+2013>2010 as daughters of the [[ununseptium]] isotopes <sup>293</sup>Uus and <sup>294</sup>Uus.<ref name="117s">{{cite doi|10.1103/PhysRevLett.104.142502}}</ref> The JINR also has future plans to study lighter isotopes of element 115 by replacing the americium-243 target with the lighter isotope [[americium-241]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Study of heavy and superheavy nuclei (see experiment 1.5)|url=http://flerovlab.jinr.ru/flnr/education_list.html|work=Flerov Laboratory of Nuclear Reactions}}</ref>

The [[IUPAC/IUPAP Joint Working Party]] (JWP) will decide which team officially discovered ununpentium and give that team the right to suggest a permanent name for it. In 2011, it evaluated the 2004 and 2007 Dubna experiments, and concluded that they did not meet the criteria for discovery. Another evaluation of more recent experiments will take place within the next few years, and a claim to the discovery of ununpentium has been again put forward by Dubna.<ref name=JWP/> In August 2013, a team of researchers at [[Lund University]] announced they had repeated the 2004 experiment, confirming Dubna's findings.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.lunduniversity.lu.se/o.o.i.s?id=24890&news_item=6082|agency=Lund University|title=EXISTENCE OF NEW ELEMENT CONFIRMED|date=27 August 2013|accessdate=27 August 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://prl.aps.org/accepted/2207dY2bS631e84382e425232df55fb5da302c431|title=Spectroscopy of element 115 decay chains (Accepted for publication on Physical Review Letters on 9 August 2013)|accessdate=2 September 2013}}</ref> Researchers at the [[Gesellschaft f<U+00FC>r Schwerionenforschung]] (GSI) in [[Darmstadt]], [[Germany]] reported another successful confirmation just two weeks later, on September 10, 2013.<ref name="autogenerated1">{{cite web|url=http://prl.aps.org/abstract/PRL/v111/i11/e112502 |title=Phys.

Ununpentium is expected to be in the middle of an [[island of stability]] centered around [[copernicium]] (element 112) and [[flerovium]] (element 114): the reasons for the presence of this island are however still not well understood.<ref name="Zagrebaev">{{cite conference |last1=Zagrebaev |first1=Valeriy |last2=Karpov |first2=Alexander |last3=Greiner |first3=Walter |year=2013 |title=Future of superheavy element research: Which nuclei could be synthesized within the next few years? |publisher=IOP Science |booktitle=Journal of Physics: Conference Series |volume=420 |pages=1<U+2013>15 |url=http://iopscience.iop.org/1742-6596/420/1/012001/pdf/1742-6596_420_1_012001.pdf |accessdate=20 August 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=Van Nostrand's scientific encyclopedia|first1=Glenn D. |last1= Considine |first2=Peter H. |last2= Kulik|publisher=Wiley-Interscience|year=2002|edition=9|isbn=978-0-471-33230-5|oclc=223349096}}</ref>  Due to the expected high fission barriers, any nucleus within this island of stability exclusively decays by alpha decay and perhaps some electron capture and [[beta decay]].<ref name=BFricke/> While the known isotopes of ununpentium do not actually have enough neutrons to be on the island of stability, they can be seen to approach the island as in general, the heavier isotopes are the longer-lived ones.<ref name=e115/><ref name=117s/>

The isotope <sup>291</sup>Uup is especially interesting as it has only one neutron more than the heaviest known ununpentium isotope, <sup>290</sup>Uup. It could plausibly be synthesized as the daughter of <sup>295</sup>Uus, which in turn could be made from the reaction <sup>249</sup>Bk(<sup>48</sup>Ca,2n)<sup>295</sup>Uus.<ref name=Zagrebaev/> Calculations show that it may have a significant [[electron capture]] or [[positron emission]] decay mode in addition to alpha decaying and also have a relatively long half-life of several seconds. This would produce <sup>291</sup>[[flerovium|Fl]], <sup>291</sup>Uut, and finally <sup>291</sup>[[copernicium|Cn]] which is expected to be in the middle of the island of stability and have a half-life of about 1200&nbsp;years, affording the most likely hope of reaching the middle of the island using current technology. Possible drawbacks are that the cross section of the production reaction of <sup>295</sup>Uus is expected to be low and the decay properties of superheavy nuclei this close to the line of beta stability are largely unexplored.<ref name=Zagrebaev/>

Other possibilities to synthesize nuclei on the island of stability include quasifission (partial fusion followed by fission) of a massive nucleus.<ref name=ZG/> Such nuclei tend to fission, expelling doubly-magic or nearly doubly-magic fragments such as [[calcium-40]], [[tin-132]], [[lead-208]], or [[bismuth-209]].<ref name=jinr20006>{{cite web|title=JINR Annual Reports 2000<U+2013>2006|url=http://www1.jinr.ru/Reports/Reports_eng_arh.html|publisher=[[Joint Institute for Nuclear Research|JINR]]|accessdate=2013-08-27}}</ref> Recently it has been shown that the multi-nucleon transfer reactions in collisions of actinide nuclei (such as [[uranium]] and [[curium]]) might be used to synthesize the neutron-rich superheavy nuclei located at the [[island of stability]],<ref name=ZG>{{cite journal|last1=Zagrebaev |first1=V.|last2=Greiner |first2=W.|year=2008|title=Synthesis of superheavy nuclei: A search for new production reactions|journal=[[Physical Review C]]|volume=78 |issue=3 |page=034610|arxiv=0807.2537|bibcode=2008PhRvC..78c4610Z|doi=10.1103/PhysRevC.78.034610}}</ref> although formation of the lighter elements [[nobelium]] or [[seaborgium]] is more favored.<ref name=Zagrebaev/> One last possibility to synthesize isotopes near the island is to use controlled [[nuclear explosion]]s to create a [[neutron flux]] high enough to bypass the gaps of instability at <sup>258<U+2013>260</sup>[[fermium|Fm]] and at [[mass number]] 275 (atomic numbers [[rutherfordium|104]] to [[hassium|108]]), mimicking the [[r-process]] in which the [[actinide]]s were first produced in nature and the gap of instability around [[radon]] bypassed.<ref name=Zagrebaev/> Some such isotopes (especially <sup>291</sup>Cn and <sup>293</sup>Cn) may even have been synthesized in nature, but would have decayed away far too quickly (with half-lives of only thousands of years) and be produced in far too small quantities (about 10<sup><U+2212>12</sup> the abundance of [[lead]]) to be detectable as [[primordial nuclide]]s today outside [[cosmic ray]]s.<ref name=Zagrebaev/>

===Physical and atomic===
Ununpentium is a member of group 15 in the [[periodic table]], below [[nitrogen]], [[phosphorus]], [[arsenic]], [[antimony]], and bismuth. Every previous group 15 element has five electrons in its valence shell, forming a [[valence electron]] configuration of ns<sup>2</sup>np<sup>3</sup>. In ununpentium's case, the trend will be continued and the valence electron configuration is predicted to be 7s<sup>2</sup>7p<sup>3</sup>;<ref name="Haire"/> therefore, ununpentium will behave similarly to its lighter [[congener (chemistry)|congeners]] in many respects. However, notable differences are likely to arise; a largely contributing effect is the [[spin<U+2013>orbit interaction|spin<U+2013>orbit (SO) interaction]]<U+2014>the mutual interaction between the electrons' motion and [[spin (physics)|spin]]. It is especially strong for the superheavy elements, because their electrons move much faster than in lighter atoms, at velocities comparable to the [[speed of light]].<ref name=Thayer/> In relation to ununpentium atoms, it lowers the 7s and the 7p electron energy levels<!--|level is an important word. Lv has no 8s electrons but they've been shown to affect its chem---> (stabilizing the corresponding electrons), but two of the 7p electron energy levels are stabilized more than the other four.<ref name="Faegri">{{Cite journal|last1=Faegri |first1=K.|last2=Saue |first2=T.|year=2001|title=Diatomic molecules between very heavy elements of group 13 and group 17: A study of relativistic effects on bonding|journal=[[Journal of Chemical Physics]]|volume=115 |issue=6 |pages=2456|bibcode=2001JChPh.115.2456F|doi=10.1063/1.1385366 }}</ref> The stabilization of the 7s electrons is called the [[inert pair effect]], and the effect "tearing" the 7p subshell into the more stabilized and the less stabilized parts is called subshell splitting.

The valence electrons of ununpentium fall into three subshells: 7s (two electrons), 7p<sub>1/2</sub> (two electrons), and 7p<sub>3/2</sub> (one electron). The first two of these are relativistically stabilized and hence behave as [[inert pair effect|inert pairs]], while the last is relativistically destabilized and can easily participate in chemistry.<ref name=Haire/> (The 6d electrons are not destabilized enough to participate chemically, although this may still be possible in the two previous elements ununtrium and flerovium.)<ref name=BFricke/> Thus, the +1 [[oxidation state]] should be favored, like [[thallium|Tl]]<sup>+</sup>, and consistent with this the first [[ionization potential]] of ununpentium should be around 5.58&nbsp;[[electronvolt|eV]], continuing the trend towards lower ionization potentials down the pnictogens.<ref name=Haire/> Due to ununpentium and ununtrium both having one electron outside a quasi-closed shell configuration that can be [[delocalization|delocalized]] in the metallic state, they should have similar [[melting point|melting]] and [[boiling point]]s (both melting around 400&nbsp;<U+00B0>C and boiling around 1100&nbsp;<U+00B0>C) due to the strength of their [[metallic bond]]s being similar.<ref name=BFricke/> Additionally, the predicted ionization potential, [[ionic radius]] (1.5&nbsp;[[angstrom|<U+00C5>]] for Uup<sup>+</sup>; 1.0&nbsp;<U+00C5> for Uup<sup>3+</sup>), and [[polarizability]] of Uup<sup>+</sup> are expected to be more similar to Tl<sup>+</sup> than its true congener [[bismuth|Bi<sup>3+</sup>]].<ref name=BFricke/> Ununpentium should be a dense metal due to its high [[atomic weight]], with a density around 13.5&nbsp;g/cm<sup>3</sup>.<ref name=BFricke/> The electron of the [[hydrogen-like atom|hydrogen-like]] ununpentium atom (oxidized so that it only has one electron, Uup<sup>114+</sup>) is expected to move so fast that it has a mass 1.82 times that of a stationary electron, due to [[relativistic quantum chemistry|relativistic effects]]. For comparison, the figures for hydrogen-like bismuth and antimony are expected to be 1.25 and 1.077 respectively.<ref name=Thayer>{{cite book|title=Chemistry of Heavier Main Group Elements|last=Thayer|first=John S.|doi=10.1007/9781402099755_2|year=2010|pages=63<U+2013>67, 83}}</ref>

===Chemical===
Ununpentium is projected to be the third member of the 7p series of [[chemical element]]s and the heaviest member of group 15 (VA) in the Periodic Table, below [[bismuth]]. In this group, each member is known to portray the group oxidation state of +5 but with differing stability. For nitrogen, the +5 state is mostly a formal explanation of molecules like [[dinitrogen pentoxide|N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>]]: it is very difficult to have five [[covalent bond]]s to nitrogen due to the lack of low-lying d-[[Atomic orbital|orbitals]] and the inability of the small nitrogen atom to accommodate five [[ligand]]s. The +5 state is well represented for the essentially non-relativistic typical pnictogens [[phosphorus]], [[arsenic]], and [[antimony]]. However, for bismuth it becomes rare due to the relativistic stabilization of the 6s orbitals known as the [[inert pair effect]], so that the 6s electrons are reluctant to bond chemically. It is expected that ununpentium will have an inert pair effect for both the 7s and the 7p<sub>1/2</sub> electrons, as the [[binding energy]] of the lone 7p<sub>3/2</sub> electron is noticeably lower than that of the 7p<sub>1/2</sub> electrons. Nitrogen(I) and bismuth(I) are known but rare and ununpentium(I) is likely to show some unique properties,<ref>{{cite journal|last=Keller|first=O. L., Jr.|coauthors=C. W. Nestor, Jr.|year=1974|title=Predicted properties of the superheavy elements. III. Element 115, Eka-bismuth|journal=Journal of Physical Chemistry|volume=78|page=1945|doi=10.1021/j100612a015|issue=19}}</ref> probably behaving more like thallium(I) than bismuth(I).<ref name=BFricke/> Because of spin-orbit coupling, [[flerovium]] may display closed-shell or noble gas-like properties; if this is the case, ununpentium will likely be typically monovalent as a result, since the cation Uup<sup>+</sup> will have the same electron configuration as flerovium, perhaps giving ununpentium some [[alkali metal]] character.<ref name=BFricke/> However, the Uup<sup>3+</sup> cation would behave like its true lighter homolog Bi<sup>3+</sup>.<ref name=BFricke/> The 7s electrons are too stabilized to be able to contribute chemically and hence the +5 state should be impossible and ununpentium may be considered to have only three valence electrons.<ref name=BFricke/> Ununpentium would be quite a reactive metal, with an [[oxidation potential]] of about 1.5&nbsp;[[volt|V]].<ref name=BFricke/>

The chemistry of ununpentium in [[aqueous solution]] should essentially be that of the Uup<sup>+</sup> and Uup<sup>3+</sup> ions. The former should be easily [[hydrolysis|hydrolyzed]] and not be easily [[coordination complex|complexed]] with [[halide]]s, [[cyanide]], and [[ammonia]].<ref name=BFricke/> Ununpentium(I) [[hydroxide]] (UupOH), [[carbonate]] (Uup<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>), [[oxalate]] (Uup<sub>2</sub>C<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>), and [[fluoride]] (UupF) should be soluble in water; the [[sulfide]] (Uup<sub>2</sub>S) should be insoluble; and the [[chloride]] (UupCl), [[bromide]] (UupBr), [[iodide]] (UupI), and [[thiocyanate]] (UupSCN) should be only slightly soluble, so that adding excess [[hydrochloric acid]] would not noticeably affect the solubility of ununpentium(I) chloride.<ref name=BFricke/> Uup<sup>3+</sup> should be about as stable as Tl<sup>3+</sup> and hence should also be an important part of ununpentium chemistry, although its closest [[homology (chemistry)|homolog]] among the elements should be its lighter congener Bi<sup>3+</sup>.<ref name=BFricke/> Ununpentium(III) fluoride (UupF<sub>3</sub>) and [[thiozonide]] (UupS<sub>3</sub>) should be insoluble in water, similar to the corresponding bismuth compounds, while ununpentium(III) chloride (UupCl<sub>3</sub>), bromide (UupBr<sub>3</sub>), and iodide (UupI<sub>3</sub>) should be readily soluble and easily hydrolyzed to form [[oxyhalide]]s such as UupOCl and UupOBr, again analogous to bismuth.<ref name=BFricke/> Both ununpentium(I) and ununpentium(III) should be common oxidation states and their relative stability should depend greatly on what they are complexed with and the likelihood of hydrolysis.<ref name=BFricke/>

This, while an unforeseen complication, could give information that would help in the future chemical investigation of the heavier homologs of bismuth and polonium, which are respectively ununpentium and [[livermorium]].<ref name=Eichler/> The produced nuclides [[bismuth-213]] and [[polonium-212m]] were transported as the hydrides [[bismuthane|<sup>213</sup>BiH<sub>3</sub>]] and [[polonium hydride|<sup>212m</sup>PoH<sub>2</sub>]] at 850&nbsp;<U+00B0>C through a quartz wool filter unit held with [[tantalum]], showing that these hydrides were surprisingly thermally stable, although their heavier congeners UupH<sub>3</sub> and LvH<sub>2</sub> would be expected to be less thermally stable from simple extrapolation of [[periodic trends]] in the p-block.<ref name=Eichler/> Further calculations on the stability and electronic structure of BiH<sub>3</sub>, UupH<sub>3</sub>, PoH<sub>2</sub>, and LvH<sub>2</sub> are needed before chemical investigations take place. However, ununpentium and livermorium are expected to be volatile enough as pure elements for them to be chemically investigated in the near future. The chief barrier to their chemical investigation at present is the lack of known isotopes of these elements which are long-lived enough.<ref name=Eichler/>
