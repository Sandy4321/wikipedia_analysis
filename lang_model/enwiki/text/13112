He made his debut for [[Auckland Rugby Football Union|Auckland]] for their [[National Provincial Championship]] (NPC) competition in 1999 and in that same year they won the NPC.

A series of injuries to both of his knees ended his playing career in 2006.

==Coaching career==
Tanivula coached the [[Nadi]] rugby team in the [[Digicel Cup (rugby)|Digicel Cup]] and in 2008 he created history by winning the Farebrother Sullivan Trophy as well as the Digicel Cup. He also guided the [[Western Crusaders]] team which won the [[Colonial Cup (rugby union)#Past winners|Colonial Cup]]. In early 2009, he guided the [[Fiji Warriors]] team to the [[2009 Pacific Rugby Cup]] defeating the [[Upolu Samoa]] team in the final. His impressive work pleased the [[Fiji Rugby Union]] and they offered him the head coaching job of the [[Fiji national rugby union team (sevens)|Fiji sevens]] team, a position left vacant after the termination of [[Waisale Serevi]]'s contract.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.irb.com/irbsevens/news/newsid=2028867.html |title=Tanivula: Kiwi head Fiji heart |publisher=Irb.com |date= |accessdate=29 March 2011}}</ref> He coached his first sevens tournament in [[2009 Wellington Sevens|Wellington]] where Fiji was bundled out in the quarter finals. the following week in [[2009 USA Sevens|San Diego]], Fiji was bundled out in the quarters again. He then coached Fiji to the [[2009 Rugby World Cup Sevens]] where Fiji lost in the quarter finals again and thus losing their world champions status. A few week later he turned the table in [[2009 Hong Kong Sevens#Cup|Hong Kong]] when Fiji defeated [[South Africa national rugby union team (sevens)|South Africa]] and claimed a first win in 2 years. He then coached the side to the [[Rugby union at the 2009 World Games|2009 World Games]] where Fiji defeated [[Portugal national rugby union team (sevens)|Portugal]] to retain their gold medal. Fiji lost at the [[2009 London Sevens]] but won a week later at [[2009 Edinburgh Sevens|Murrayfield]] and finished 2nd in the season under Tanivula's guidance. Tanivula renewed his contract with the FRU for another 3 years hoping to guide Fiji to the [[2013 Rugby World Cup Sevens]] but he was fired in 2011 and replaced by the inept [[Alifereti Dere]] who failed to win the Melrose Cup just like his predecessor as the team finished 3rd. Tanivula returned to coaching in the [[Digicel Cup (rugby)|Digicel Cup]] with Nadi.
