[[Image:Johann Strauss II (3).jpg|right|thumb|200px|Johann Strauss II]]
'''Johann Strauss II''' (October 25, 1825 &ndash; June 3, 1899; {{lang-de|Johann Baptist Strau<U+00DF>}}; also known as '''Johann Baptist Strauss''', '''Johann Strauss, Jr.''', or '''Johann Strauss the Younger''') was an [[Austria]]n composer of [[light music]], particularly [[dance music]] and [[operetta]]s. He composed over 500 [[waltz]]es, [[polka]]s, [[quadrille]]s, and other types of dance music, as well as several operettas and a [[ballet]]. In his lifetime, he was known as "The Waltz King", and was largely responsible for the popularity of the waltz in [[Vienna, Austria|Vienna]] during the 19th century.

Strauss was the son of [[Johann Strauss I]], another composer of dance music. His father did not wish him to become a composer, but rather a [[banker]]; however, the son defied his father's wishes, and went on to study music with the composer Joseph Drechsler and the [[violin]] with Anton Kollmann, the ballet r<U+00E9>p<U+00E9>titeur of the [[Vienna Court Opera]]. Strauss had two younger brothers, [[Josef Strauss|Josef]] and [[Eduard Strauss]], who became composers of light music as well, although they were never as well-known as their elder brother.

Some of Johann Strauss's most famous works include the waltzes ''[[The Blue Danube]]'', ''[[Kaiser-Walzer]]'', ''[[Tales from the Vienna Woods]]'', the ''[[Tritsch-Tratsch-Polka]]'', and the ''[[Pizzicato Polka]]''. Among his operettas, ''[[Die Fledermaus]]'' and ''[[Der Zigeunerbaron]]'' are the most well-known.

==Early life==
Strauss was born in Vienna, Austria, on 25 October 1825, to the famous composer [[Johann Strauss I]]. His father did not want him to become a musician but rather a [[banker]];<ref name=smith/> nevertheless, Strauss Junior studied the [[violin]] secretly as a child, ironically with the first violinist of his father's orchestra, [[Franz Amon]].<ref name=smith>{{cite web |url=http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/subscriber/article/grove/music/52380pg2?q=johann+strauss+ii&search=quick&pos=1&_start=1#firsthit |title=Johann Strauss II |accessdate={{Date|2008-09-28}}|work= |publisher=Grove Music Online |date= }}</ref> When his father discovered his son secretly practising on a violin one day, he gave him a severe whipping, saying that he was going to beat the music out of the boy.<ref>{{cite book |title=The Waltz Kings|authorlink=Hans Fantel |publisher=William Morrow & Company |page=75}}</ref> It seems that rather than trying to avoid a Strauss rivalry, the elder Strauss only wanted his son to escape the rigors of a musician's life.<ref name=same>{{cite book |title=Johann Strauss <U+2014> End of an Era|authorlink=Egon Gartenberg |publisher=Pennsylvania State University Press |page=124}}</ref> It was only when the father abandoned his family for a mistress, Emilie Trampusch, that the son was able to concentrate fully on a career as a composer with the support of his mother.<ref name=same>{{cite book |title=Johann Strauss <U+2014> End of an Era|authorlink=Egon Gartenberg |publisher=Pennsylvania State University Press |page=121}}</ref>

Strauss studied [[counterpoint]] and [[harmony]] with theorist Professor Joachim Hoffmann,<ref name=smith/> who owned a private music school. His talents were also recognized by composer [[Josef Drechsler]], who taught him exercises in harmony. His other violin teacher, Anton Kollmann, who was the ballet r<U+00E9>p<U+00E9>titeur of the [[Vienna State Opera|Vienna Court Opera]], also wrote excellent testimonials for him. Armed with these, on the very same day his mother filed a divorce from her husband, he approached the Viennese authorities to apply for a license to perform.<ref name=same>{{cite book |title=Johann Strauss <U+2014> End of an Era|authorlink=Egon Gartenberg |publisher=Pennsylvania State University Press |page=126}}</ref> He initially formed his small orchestra where he recruited his members at the ''Zur Stadt Belgrad'' tavern, where musicians seeking work could be hired easily.<ref>{{cite book |title=The Waltz Kings|authorlink=Hans Fantel |publisher=William Morrow & Company |page=76}}</ref>

==Debut as a composer==
[[Johann Strauss I]]'s influence over the local entertainment establishments meant that many of them were wary of offering the younger Strauss a contract for fear of angering the father.<ref name=same/> Strauss Jr. was able to persuade the Dommayer's Casino in [[Hietzing]], a suburb of Vienna, to allow him to perform.<ref>{{cite book|title=Johann Strauss, Father and Son: A Century of Light Music|authorlink=H. E. Jacob |year= |publisher=The Greystone Press|page=127}}</ref> The elder Strauss, in anger at his son's disobedience, and at that of the proprietor, refused to ever play at the Dommayer's Casino again,<ref name=same>{{cite book |title=Johann Strauss <U+2014> End of an Era|authorlink=Egon Gartenberg |publisher=Pennsylvania State University Press |page=125}}</ref>
which had been the site of many of his earlier triumphs.

Strauss made his debut at Dommayer's in October of 1844, where he performed some of his first works, such as the waltzes [[Sinngedichte]], op. 1 and [[Die Gunstwerber]] op. 4 and the polka [[Herzenslust]], op. 3.<ref name=grove/> Critics and the press were unanimous in their praise for Strauss's music. A critic for ''Der Wanderer'' commented that "Strauss<U+2019>s name will be worthily continued in his son; children and children<U+2019>s children can look forward to the future, and three-quarter time will find a strong footing in him."<ref name=grove/>

Despite the initial fanfare, Strauss found his early years as a composer difficult, but he soon won over audiences after accepting commissions to perform away from home. The first major appointment for the young composer was his award of the honorary position of "Kapellmeister of the 2nd Vienna Citizen's Regiment", which had been left vacant following [[Josef Lanner]]'s death two years before.<ref>[http://www.alabamasymphony.org/content.asp?id=251815 Alabama Symphony]</ref>

[[Image:Johann Strauss II (4).jpg|thumb|200|Johann Strauss in his younger years]]
Vienna was racked by a bourgeois revolution on February 24, 1848, and the intense rivalry between father and son became much more apparent. Johann Jr. decided to side with the revolutionaries. It was a decision that was professionally disadvantageous, as the Austrian royalty twice denied him the much coveted '[[Kaiserlich und k<U+00F6>niglich|KK]] Hofballmusikdirektor' position, which was first designated especially for Johann I in recognition of his musical contributions. Further, the younger Strauss was also arrested by the Viennese authorities for publicly playing the [[La Marseillaise]], but was later acquitted.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Waltz Kings|authorlink=Hans Fantel |year=1972 |publisher=William Morrow & Company, Inc. |page=96}}</ref> The elder Strauss remained loyal to the monarchy, and composed his "[[Radetzky March]]" op. 228 (dedicated to the Habsburg field marshal [[Joseph Radetzky von Radetz]]), which would become one of his best-known compositions.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Waltz Kings|authorlink=Hans Fantel |year=1972 |publisher=William Morrow & Company, Inc. |page=89}}</ref>

When the elder Strauss died from [[scarlet fever]] in Vienna in 1849, the younger Strauss merged both their orchestras and engaged in further tours.<ref name=grove/> Later, he also composed a number of patriotic marches dedicated to the [[Habsburg]] monarch [[Franz Joseph I of Austria|Franz Josef I]], such as the ''Kaiser Franz-Josef Marsch'' op. 67 and the ''Kaiser Franz Josef Rettungs Jubel-Marsch'' op. 126, probably to ingratiate himself in the eyes of the new monarch, who ascended to the Austrian throne after the 1848 revolution.<ref name=grove/>

==Career advancements==
Strauss Jr. eventually surpassed his father's fame, and became one of the most popular of waltz composers of the era, extensively touring [[Austria]], [[Poland]], and [[Germany]] with his orchestra. He applied for the KK Hofballmusikdirektor ''Music Director of the Royal Court Balls'' position, which he eventually attained in 1863,<ref name=grove/> after being denied several times before for his frequent brushes with the local authorities.

After establishing his first orchestra prior to his father's death, Strauss founded many others to be supplied to various entertainment establishments, such as the 'Sperl' ballroom, as well as the 'Apollo', where he dedicated appropriately titled pieces to commemorate the first performances there. In 1853, due to constant mental and physical demands, Strauss suffered a nervous breakdown.<ref name=grove/> He took a seven-week vacation in the countryside in the summer of that year, on the advice of doctors. Johann's younger brother [[Josef Strauss|Josef]] was persuaded by his family to abandon his career as an [[engineer]] and take command of Johann's orchestra in the absence of the latter.<ref name=grove/>

In 1855, Strauss accepted commissions from the management of the Tsarskoye-Selo Railway Company of St. Petersburg to play in Russia for the Vauxhall Pavilion at Pavlovsk in 1856. He would later return to perform in Russia for every year until 1865. <ref name=grove/>

Later, in the 1870s, Strauss and his orchestra toured the [[United States]], where he took part in the Boston Festival at the invitation of [[bandmaster]] [[Patrick Gilmore]] and was the lead conductor in a 'Monster Concert' of over 1000 performers,<ref name=gartenberg>{{cite book|title=Johann Strauss <U+2014> End of an Era |authorlink=Egon Gartenberg year=1972 |publisher=Pennsylvania State University Press |page=246}}</ref> performing his "Blue Danube" waltz, amongst other pieces, to great acclaim.<ref name=gartenberg/>

==Marriages==
Strauss married the singer [[Henrietta Treffz|Jetty Treffz]] in 1862, and they remained together until Jetty's death in 1878.<ref name=grove>{{cite web |url=http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/subscriber/article/grove/music/52380pg2?q=johann+strauss+ii&search=quick&pos=1&_start=1#firsthit |title=Strauss: Johann Strauss II |accessdate={{Date|2008-09-28}}|publisher=Grove Music Online}}</ref> Six weeks after her death,<ref name=grove/><ref name=archives>{{cite web |url=http://www.classicalarchives.com/composer/3411.html#about |title= Johann Strauss II 1825-1899); AUT |accessdate={{Date|2009-04-13}}|publisher=Classical Archives}}</ref> Strauss married the actress Angelika Dittrich. Angelika was not a fervent supporter of his music, and their differences in age and opinion, and especially her indiscretion, led him to seek a [[divorce]].<ref name=smith/>

Strauss was not granted a divorce by the [[Roman Catholic]] church, and therefore changed religion and nationality, and became a citizen of [[Saxe-Coburg-Gotha]] in January 1887.<ref name=smith/> Strauss  sought solace in his third wife Adele, whom he married in August 1882, and she encouraged the creative talent to flow once more in his later years, resulting in many famous compositions, such as the [[operetta]]s ''Der Zigeunerbaron'' and ''Waldmeister'', and the waltzes "[[Kaiser-Walzer]]" op. 437, "[[Kaiser Jubil<U+00E4>um]]" op. 434, and "[[Klug Gretelein]]" op. 462.

==Musical rivals and admirers==
[[Image:Johann Strauss and Brahms in Vienna.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Johann Strauss and [[Johannes Brahms]] photographed in [[Vienna]]]]
Although Strauss was the most sought-after composer of dance music in the latter half of the 19th century, stiff competition was present in the form of [[Karl Michael Ziehrer]] and [[Emile Waldteufel]]; the latter held a commanding position in [[Paris]].<ref>[http://www.naxos.com/composerinfo/Emile_Waldteufel/22394.htm WALDTEUFEL, EMILE  BIOGRAPHY]</ref> [[Phillip Fahrbach]] also denied the younger Strauss the commanding position of the ''KK Hofballmusikdirektor'' when the latter first applied for the post. The German operetta composer [[Jacques Offenbach]], who made his name in Paris, also posed a challenge to Strauss in the [[operetta]] field.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.theatrehistory.com/misc/vienneseoperetta.html |title=THE VIENNESE OPERETTA |accessdate={{Date|2009-4-14}}}}</ref>

Strauss was admired by other prominent composers: [[Richard Wagner]] once admitted that he liked the waltz [[Wein, Weib und Gesang]] op. 333.<ref>{{cite book |title=Johann Strauss, Father and Son: A Century of Light Music |authorlink=H. E. Jacob |year=1940 |publisher=The Greystone Press|page=226}}</ref> [[Richard Strauss]] (unrelated to the Strauss family), when writing his ''[[Der Rosenkavalier|Rosenkavalier]]'' waltzes, said in reference to Johann Strauss: "How could I forget the laughing genius of Vienna?"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.viennaticket.com/viennatickets/?p=10 |title=Vienna Tickets >> Johann Strauss |accessdate={{Date|2008-10-03}}}}</ref>

[[Johannes Brahms]] was a personal friend of Strauss, and to whom the latter dedicated his waltz "[[Seid umschlungen, Millionen!]]" ("Be Embraced, You Millions!"), op. 443.<ref>{{cite book |title=Seid umshlungen, Millionen!|authorlink=Norbert Rubey |publisher=Diletto Musicale, Doblinger}}</ref> A story is told in biographies of both men that Strauss's wife Adele approached Brahms with a customary request that he autograph her fan. It was usual for the composer to inscribe a few measures of his best-known music, and then sign his name. Brahms, however, inscribed a few measures from the "Blue Danube", and then wrote beneath it: "Unfortunately, NOT by Johannes Brahms."<ref>{{cite book |title=Johann Strauss, Father and Son: A Century of Light Music |authorlink=H. E. Jacob |year=1940 |publisher=The Greystone Press|page=227}}</ref>

{{Listen|filename=An_der_sch%C3%B6nem_blauen_Donau.ogg|title=The Blue Danube|description=[[The Blue Danube]] by Johann Strauss II|format=[[Ogg]]}}
The most famous of Strauss' operettas are ''[[Die Fledermaus]]'', ''[[Eine Nacht in Venedig]]'', and ''[[Der Zigeunerbaron]]''. Notwithstanding the lack of popularity of them, there are many dance pieces drawn from themes of his operettas, such as "Cagliostro-Walzer" op. 370 (from ''[[Cagliostro in Wien]]''), "O Sch<U+00F6>ner Mai" Walzer op. 375 (from ''[[Prinz Methusalem]]''), "Rosen aus dem S<U+00FC>den" Walzer op. 388 (from ''[[Das Spitzentuch der K<U+00F6>nigin]]''), and "[[Kuss-Walzer]]" op. 400 (from ''[[Der lustige Krieg]]''), that have survived obscurity and become well-known. Strauss also wrote an [[opera]], ''[[Ritter P<U+00E1>sm<U+00E1>n]]'', <ref>{{cite book|title=Operetta: A theatrical history
|authorlink=Richard Traubner |year= |publisher=Routledge|page=131}}</ref> and was in the middle of composing an operetta, [[Aschenbrodel]], when he died in 1899.<ref name=a/>

==Death and legacy==
[[Image:Johann-strauss-stadtpark.jpg|right|250px|thumb|A statue of the Waltz King in [[Stadtpark]], [[Vienna]]]]
Strauss was diagnosed with [[double pneumonia]] in the spring of 1899,<ref>{{cite book |title=Johann Strauss, Father and Son: A Century of Light Music |authorlink=H. E. Jacob |year=1940 |publisher=The Greystone Press|page=341}}</ref> and died on June 3, 1899, at the age of 73. He was buried in the [[Zentralfriedhof]]. At the time of his death, he was still composing his ballet ''[[Aschenbroedel|Aschenbr<U+00F6>del]]''.<ref name=a>{{cite book |title=Johann Strauss, Father and Son: A Century of Light Music |authorlink=H. E. Jacob |year=1940 |publisher=The Greystone Press|page=341}}</ref>

Strauss's music is now regularly performed at the annual ''[[Vienna New Year's Concert|Neujahrskonzert]]'' of the [[Vienna Philharmonic|Vienna Philharmonic Orchestra]], as a result of the efforts by [[Clemens Krauss]] who performed a special all-Strauss programme in 1929 with the Viennese orchestra. Many distinguished Strauss interpreters include [[Willi Boskovsky]],<ref>[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D0CE1D61F39F937A15757C0A967958260 "Willi Boskovsky, 81, Waltz Violinist, Dies"], ''New York Times'', April 24, 1991.</ref> who carried on the "Vorgeiger" tradition of conducting with violin in hand, as is the Strauss family custom, as well as [[Herbert von Karajan]] and the opera conductor [[Riccardo Muti]]. In addition, the [[Wiener Johann Strauss Orchester]], which was formed in 1966, pays tribute to the touring orchestras of which the Strauss family are also known for.<ref>[http://members.magnet.at/strauss/strauss.htm Vienna Johann Strau<U+00DF> Orchestra]</ref>

It is to be noted that most of the Strauss works that are performed today may have existed in a barely different form as conceived by Johann Strauss, as [[Eduard Strauss]] destroyed a great amount of original Strauss orchestral archives in a furnace factory in Vienna's [[Mariahilf]] district in 1907.<ref>{{cite book |title=Johann Strauss, Father and Son: A Century of Light Music |authorlink=H. E. Jacob |year=1940 |publisher=The Greystone Press|page=363}}</ref> Eduard, then the only surviving brother of the three, took this drastic precaution after agreeing to a pact between himself and brother Josef that whoever outlived the other was to destroy their works. The measure was intended to prevent the Strauss family's works from being claimed as another composer's own. This may have also been fuelled by Strauss's rivalry with another popular Viennese waltz and march composer, [[Karl Michael Ziehrer]].<ref>{{cite book |title=Johann Strauss and Vienna |authorlink=Camille Crittenden |publisher=Cambridge University Press|page=89}}</ref>

==Portrayals in the media==
The lives of the Strauss dynasty members and their world-renowned craft of composing Viennese waltzes are also briefly documented in several [[television]] adaptations, such as ''The Strauss Dynasty'' (1991)<ref>{{Imdb title|0101208|The Strauss Dynasty|(1991)}}</ref> and ''Strauss, the King of 3/4 Time'' (1995).<ref>{{Imdb title|0124146|Strauss, the King of 3/4 Time|(1995)}}</ref> Many other films used his works and melodies, and several films have been based upon the life of the musician, the most famous of which is called ''[[The Great Waltz (film)|The Great Waltz]]'' (1938).<ref>{{Imdb title|0030202|The Great Waltz|(1938)}}</ref> [[Alfred Hitchcock]] made a low-budget [[biopic]] of Strauss in 1933 called ''[[Waltzes from Vienna]]''.<ref>{{Imdb title|0024747|Waltzes from Vienna|(1934)}}</ref> After a trip to Vienna, [[Walt Disney]] was inspired to create four feature films. One of those was "The Waltz King", a loosely adapted biopic of Johann Strauss, which aired as part of the Wonderful World of Disney in the U.S. in 1963.<ref>[http://www.islandnet.com/~kpolsson/disnehis/disn1963.htm Chronology of the Waltz Disney Company]</ref>
