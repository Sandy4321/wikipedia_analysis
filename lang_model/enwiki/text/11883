'''Edward Edwards''' (1812<U+2013>1886) was a British librarian, library historian, and biographer. He was an important figure in the establishment of free libraries in the U.K.

==Early life and work==
He was born in London, England on December 14, 1812.  His father, Anthony Turner Edwards, was a builder.    
Of Edwards' education and early employments
we have no account, but in 1836 he appears
as a [[pamphleteer]] on subjects of public interest,
and his productions evince considerable
information as well as mental activity
and intelligence. He wrote on national universities,
with especial reference to the [[university of London]], whose charter was then
under discussion; on the [[British Museum]], at
the time undergoing thorough investigation
from [[Benjamin Hawes]]' committee; and, at a somewhat
later date, on the reform of the [[Royal Academy]]. His attention was probably directed
to the latter subject by the work he
undertook in 1837, in connection with the
patentees of the Collas system of [[engraving]],
on the [[Great Seal of the Realm|great seals of England]], and on the
medals struck under the [[French Empire]].
His account of the latter extends from 1804
to 1810, but was never completed. He also
about this time assisted Mr. W. Macarthur
in his account of [[New South Wales]], though
his name did not appear in connection with
the work.

==Association with the British Museum==
Meanwhile his pamphlet on the
museum and the evidence he had given before
the museum committee had attracted the
attention of the authorities, and in 1839 he
became a supernumerary assistant in the
printed book department, for especial employment
on the new catalogue ordered by
the trustees. Edwards was one of the four
coadjutors of [[Anthony Panizzi]] in framing the ninety-one
rules for the formation of this catalogue,
the others being John Winter Jones, afterwards
principal librarian; Thomas Watts,
afterwards keeper of printed books; and
Serjeant Parry, then, like Edwards, a supernumerary
assistant. On the commencement
of the catalogue Edwards was assigned to the
duty of cataloguing the collection of [[English civil war]] tracts, formed under [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] and the
Commonwealth by the bookseller Thomason,
and containing more than thirty thousand
separate pieces. These were entirely
catalogued by him, and his titles are generally
very good and full, sometimes perhaps almost
superfluously minute. The task seems to have
absorbed his energies for several years, or
any other literary work which he may have
produced was anonymous. About 1846 he
began to devote great attention to the statistics
of libraries, collected returns supplied
by foreign librarians or excerpted by himself
from foreign publications, and published the
results in the ''Athenteum''. Unfortunately
these statistics were frequently fallacious,
and Mr. Watts, in a series of letters published
in the ''Athenaeum'' under the signature
"Verificator," easily showed that Edwards's
assertions and conclusions were little
to be relied on. They had served, however,
to make him a popular authority, and he
was able to render very valuable service to
[[William Ewart (English politician)|William Ewart]], whose committee on
free libraries in 1850 originated the [[Public Libraries Act 1850|Public Libraries Act]]. It was natural
that Edwards should be offered the librarianship
of the first important free library established
under Mr. Ewart's act, which he was
the more disposed to accept as his engagement
at the museum had from various causes
ceased to be satisfactory to himself or the
authorities.

==Association with the Manchester Free Library==
He accordingly became in 1850
the first librarian of the Manchester Free Library (opened 1852), and applied himself
with much energy to the management and
development of the institution. His project
for a classified catalogue was published in 1855
in the form of a letter to Sir [[John Potter (Liberal politician)|John Potter]], chairman
of the library committee. The relations
of the librarian of a free library and his committee
frequently require tact and forbearance
on both sides, and this was certainly wanting
on the part of Edwards, whose temper was
naturally impatient of control, and who admits
in the pamphlet already mentioned that
he had been taxed both with indifference to
economy and with an undue regard to his
own reputation. His position grew more
and more uneasy, and in 1858 he was compelled
to resign.

==Later life==
The rest of his life was
devoted to the literary labours which will
chiefly contribute to preserve his name. In
1859 appeared his ''Memoirs of Libraries'', a
work of great value, containing a general
history of libraries from the earliest ages,
continued and supplemented by his ''Libraries and their Founders'', 1865.
By his ''Lives of the Founders of the British Museum'' (1870)
he made himself the historian of the national
library, and although his work must be supplemented
and may possibly be superseded
by others, it is likely to remain the groundwork
of every future history. It is in general
accurate as well as painstaking, and evinces
an impartiality creditable to the writer when
the circumstances of his retirement from the
museum are considered. Previous to the
appearance of this important work he had
written the article ''Libraries'' in the ''[[Encyclop<U+00E6>dia Britannica]]'', published (1869) a
small book on ''Free Town Libraries''; written
his ''Chapters on the Biographical History of the French Academy'' (1864); edited the
''Liber Monasterii de Hyda'' for the Rolls Series; and produced (1865) his biography of
Sir [[Walter Raleigh]]. The second volume is
particularly valuable, containing for the first
time a complete edition of Raleigh's correspondence;
the memoir also has considerable merit,
but it appeared almost simultaneously with that of [[James Augustus St. John]]; and it was remarked with surprise
that each biography appeared to be deficient in
whatever gave interest to the other, and that
the two would need to be blended to produce
a really satisfactory work. After the publication
of his history of the museum, Edwards
accepted an engagement to catalogue
the library of [[Queen's College, Oxford]], which
occupied him for several years. On the formation
of the Library Association in 1877
he was proposed as its first president, but the
deafness from which he was by this time
suffering would alone have been an insuperable
obstacle to his discharge of the office.
After the completion of his Oxford engagement
he retired to [[Niton, Isle of Wight]],
and occupied himself with projects for a recast
of his ''Memoirs of Libraries'', with
great alterations and improvements. A prospectus
of the intended work was issued by
Tr<U+00FC>bner & Co. Edwards negotiated for the 
appearance of a portion of it in the ''Library Chronicle'', and was understood to have collected
considerable material for it, but it
does not seem to be known whether this still
exists. His last published book was a ''Handbook to Lists of Collective Biography'', undertaken
in conjunction with Mr. C. Hole,
the first and only part of which appeared in
1885. He also wrote the greater part of the
article ''Newspapers'' in the ninth edition of the
''Encyclop<U+00E6>dia Britannica''. He died at Niton,
10 Feb. 1886.

==Assessment==
Notwithstanding serious faults
and frequent failures, Edwards's name will
always be associated with the history of librarianship
in England. His services in connection
with the free library movement were very
valuable; and he did much to awaken attention
to the defects of English libraries and librarianship.
As a literary historian he was
erudite and industrious, though not sufficiently
discriminating. His works occupy a
place of their own, and will always remain
valuable mines of information. His opinions
on library matters, whether expressed in his
evidence before the museums committee or
in his own writings, are almost always sensible
and sound. They exhibit few traces of
that vehemence of temperament and that
incapacity for harmonious co-operation with
others which were at the root of most of his
failures, and placed him in a false position for
so great a part of his life.
