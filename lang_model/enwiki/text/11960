"'''Dangerously in Love'''" is a song written and produced by [[Destiny's Child]] front-woman [[Beyonc<U+00E9> Knowles]] and producer Errol McCalla, Jr. The [[ballad]] was first recorded by [[Destiny's Child]] for their third studio album, ''[[Survivor (Destiny's Child album)|Survivor]]'' (2001), with Knowles as the lead vocalist, making it one of the few songs on ''Survivor'' that Knowles sings almost completely solo. The song later became the title track to Knowles' debut album with some minor adjustments vocally and instrumentally. "Dangerously in Love" is an [[contemporary R&B|R&B]]-[[Soul music|soul]] song, whose lyrics detail a state about being romantically obsessed. 

The song spawned a generally positive reception from music critics, who noted its flagrant resemblance to the original version featured on the Destiny's Child album while others commented that the song manages to effectively show the vocal capabilities of Knowles. "Dangerously in Love" earned Knowles an award in the category [[Grammy Award for Best Female R&B Vocal Performance|Best Female R&B Vocal Performance]] at the [[46th Grammy Awards|2004 Grammy Awards]]. 

Even with the lack of promotion, "Dangerously in Love" charted the main US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] chart and a few other [[Billboard charts|''Billboard'' component charts]] in late 2004. It peaked at number fifty-seven on the Hot 100 and reached a high point of number seventeen on the US [[Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs]] chart. Knowles first performed the song at the 2004 Grammy Awards. "Dangerously in Love" was also part of her [[set list]] on the [[Verizon Ladies First Tour]], her [[Dangerously in Love Tour|Dangerously in Love World Tour]], [[The Beyonc<U+00E9> Experience]] in [[Los Angeles]] and her world tour, [[I Am... Tour]]. Knowles has earned a number of positive reviews for her live performances of the song on her tours.
