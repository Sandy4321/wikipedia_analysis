The '''Smith & Wesson 5906''' is a [[pistol]] manufactured starting in 1989 by [[Smith & Wesson]].

==Design==
The 5906 is a full-sized, [[Trigger (firearms)|double/single action]], staggered-column [[magazine (firearms)|magazine]], [[9 mm caliber|9 mm]] pistol. The weapon's construction is all stainless steel. The firearm is chambered to fire [[9mm Parabellum|9 mm Luger Parabellum]] ammunition. The firearm was factory-shipped with a magazine disconnect feature designed to deactivate the trigger if the magazine is not fully inserted. The 5906 comes standard with either a 10 or 15 round magazine. Other features include ambidextrous safety levers, a one-piece rear wraparound grip, and a choice of either fixed sights or a rear sight fully adjustable for windage and elevation. A popular model with law enforcement and military units in the [[United States]], the 5906 is nevertheless being replaced by lighter, polymer-framed models from [[Glock]], [[Heckler & Koch]], [[SIGARMS|SIG Sauer]] as well as Smith & Wesson's own [[M&P]] line of polymer framed handguns in both 9mm and [[.40 S&W|.40]] calibers.<ref name="SupicaNahas2007">{{cite book|last1=Supica|first1=Jim|last2=Nahas|first2=Richard|title=Standard Catalog of Smith & Wesson|year=2007|publisher=F+W Media, Inc|location=Iola, Wisconsin|isbn=0-89689-293-X|pages=315<U+2013>317}}</ref>

==Variants==
The first generation Smith & Wesson semi-auto pistol designations consist of two digits, such as [[Smith & Wesson Model 39]] and [[Smith & Wesson Model 59|Model 59]]. Second generation pistols are designated by three digits; these include the [[Smith & Wesson Model 459|Model 459]], [[Smith & Wesson Model 559|Model 559]], etc.  Many second generation designs were eventually upgraded with various improvements, thus becoming the third generation pistols; these are identified by the addition of a fourth digit to the second generation model number: 5903, 5904, 5905, 5906, etc.<ref name="SupicaNahas2007"/>

[[File:Smith & Wesson 5906TSW.jpg|thumb|5906TSW]]
Produced from 1989 to 1998, the Model 5904 has an aluminum alloy frame and blued steel slide. The Model 5903 was manufactured from 1990 to 1997, and featured an aluminum alloy frame and a stainless steel slide. The Model 5905 was a very limited version, with a blued steel frame and slide. It was manufactured only in 1991, and in very low volume. The 5906 is an all stainless steel model, hence it is noticeably heavier than the others. It was produced from 1989 to 1999.<ref>[http://www.cheaperthandirt.com/EveryGun/GunMfgCategoryDetail.aspx?id=1590 Cite Cheaper Than Dirt Website]</ref> The stainless steel double-action only variant of this pistol, the Model 5946, produced from 1990 to 1999, was manufactured without safety levers, and is the primary issue [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police]] pistol and one of three pistols available for selection by [[New York City Police Department]].<ref name="nypd">http://www.nyc.gov/html/nypd/html/training_nypd/firearm_tatics.shtml</ref>

The sights are Novak Lo-Mount fixed three dot sights. Product code is 103048 which is a 4" barrel and first (square) trigger guard.<ref name="SupicaNahas2007"/>
