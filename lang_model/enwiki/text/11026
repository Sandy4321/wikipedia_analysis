'''''Burn My Eyes''''' is the debut album by American [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]] band [[Machine Head (band)|Machine Head]]. The album's themes generally tie into the social disorder and corresponding inner tension that the band was exposed to in their native [[Oakland, California]], reflected in [[Robb Flynn]]'s lyrics. The album shipped over 400,000 copies worldwide, becoming [[Roadrunner Records]]'s best selling debut album.<ref name="Revolver">{{cite journal| author=Wiederorn, Jon |year=2007 |month=May |title=Machine Head: Through the Ashes |journal=[[Revolver Magazine]]}}</ref>

==Album information==
The songs make references to some certain well-publicized controversies, such as the [[1992 Los Angeles Riots]] (heard in dialogue on "Real Eyes, Realize, Real Lies") and the [[Waco Siege]] of 1993 ("Davidian"). Elsewhere, there are tales of physical and mental abuse ("None But My Own", "The Rage To Overcome"), the condemning of profits from religious soliciting ("Death Church"), succumbing to substance abuse ("I'm Your God Now") and aforementioned themes of [[urban decay]], [[social unrest]], [[rebellion]], [[belligerence]], and [[socio-political]] commentary.

Stylistically, the album is credited as having bridged the gap between [[Pantera]]-style [[groove metal|groove]] and the [[thrash metal]] stylings of [[Slayer]]'s 80's output. Compared to their concurrent releases, it is probably their most raw and aggressive recording thus far, and the style is somewhat harkened back to on their post-''[[Supercharger (album)|Supercharger]]'' output.

The release of this album was followed shortly by numerous tours, which eventually led to drummer [[Chris Kontos (musician)|Chris Kontos]] leaving the band, and being replaced after careful consideration by the current drummer [[Dave McClain (drummer)|Dave McClain]].

The album has since became a lasting success. In 1994, it quickly became a [[Roadrunner Records]] best seller and was the label's best-selling debut album for a number of years, until the release of  [[Slipknot (band)|Slipknot's]] 1999 [[Slipknot (album)|self-titled debut]].

* ''[[Kerrang!]]'' (p.21) - "''Burn My Eyes'' took the heaviness and speed of thrash and combined it with the sledgehammer grooves of more left-field acts."
* ''[[Kerrang!]]'' (p.53) - "[O]ne of the most ferocious and groove-laden behemoths the metal world has, and likely will ever see."

==Re-release==
On October 31st 2006, [[Roadrunner Records]] announced that as part of their 25th Anniversary, they will be re-releasing ''Burn My Eyes'' with a bonus [[CD]], which includes previously unreleased tracks and rarities. It was said to be due out on January the 8th, 2007 but was then been pushed back to September 2007 so it did not interfere with the release of ''[[The Blackening]]''. However, the re-release was in fact cancelled. Robb Flynn reported this on his blog, which is posted on Machinehead1.com

"To the best of our knowledge, the BME re-release that was supposed to have coincided with the 25th anniversary of Roadrunner Records back in 2005 and was then re-scheduled to be released in Oct 2006, has been back-burnered. And as far as we're concerned, that's a good thing. This is the year of ''The Blackening'', and the time frame to re-release it has passed, not to mention that the idea of re-releasing a 13-year old album that we already celebrated with 2 anniversary shows (3 years ago) makes zero sense to us. We were never excited about re-issuing it to begin with, as it was just gonna have a bunch of b-sides, and wouldn't have been nearly as cool some of the other re-issues that had DVDs and all sorts of cool shit... so, as much as some of you may be bummed, know that it's better this way."
