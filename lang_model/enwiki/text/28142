'''"The Natural Order"''' is the twentieth episode of the [[30 Rock (season 3)|third season]] of the American television comedy show ''[[30 Rock]]''. It was written by series creator [[Tina Fey]] with co-executive producer [[John Riggi]] and directed by [[Scott Ellis]]. The episode originally aired on the [[NBC|National Broadcasting Company]] (NBC) network in the United States on April 30, 2009. Guest stars in "The Natural Order" include actors [[Elaine Stritch]] and [[Steve Buscemi]].

The plot of the episode centers around a conflict between [[Tracy Jordan]] ([[Tracy Morgan]]) and [[Liz Lemon]] (Fey) over favorable treatment. Meanwhile, [[Jenna Maroney]] ([[Jane Krakowski]]) adopts a [[gibbon]] and treats it like her child.  Finally, [[Jack Donaghy]]'s ([[Alec Baldwin]]) mother Colleen (Stritch) visits him on the thirty-fifth anniversary of the day that Jack's father left the family.

"The Natural Order" received generally mixed reception from television critics. According to the [[Nielsen ratings]] system, it was watched by 6&nbsp;million households during its original broadcast, and received a 2.7 rating/7 share among viewers in the 18<U+2013>49 demographic.

==Plot==
Liz, [[Kenneth Parcell]] ([[Jack McBrayer]]), and [[Pete Hornberger]] ([[Scott Adsit]]) all attempt to trick Tracy into arriving at a rehearsal on time. Tracy arrives not knowing what time it is and announces that Liz is racist and treating him like a child. Liz challenges Tracy to behave better so he can be treated as an adult, but he responds by sending a gibbon to replace himself at rehearsal. Liz tells Tracy to arrive on time with his lines memorized the next day if he wants to be treated equally. Tracy retaliates by acting professionally but convincing everyone to treat Liz equally too, by making her lift heavy water jugs, [[flatulence|passing gas]] near her, and inviting her to a [[strip club]] along with the other writers. Liz in turn stops Tracy from going to the strip club, noting that because he is acting so professionally he has to write notes for the upcoming script. Liz is uncomfortable at the strip club and Tracy hates writing all night so they agree to return to the "natural order" of things with both receiving preferential treatment.

Meanwhile, Jenna adopts the gibbon Tracy sends to rehearsal and treats it as her child. She dresses it in several costumes including a [[mariachi]] outfit, a [[tuxedo]], and a [[sailor suit]]. In addition she buys the gibbon a baby doll, referring to herself as a "grandmother". At the end of the episode Jenna accidentally shakes the head off of the baby doll and the gibbon attacks her.

Jack is concerned for his mother, Colleen. He tells Liz that the anniversary of his father, Jimmy Donaghy, abandoning their family is coming up and he is afraid of the effect it will have on Colleen. When Jack arrives at Colleen's hotel room to take her to dinner, however, he discovers she is staying with a man, Paul. Jack, worried she has been taken in by a [[Confidence trick|con man]] in her time of grief, hires his private investigator Lenny Wosniak (Steve Buscemi) to look into his background. Wosniak cannot find anything distasteful in Paul's background, but tells Jack that he is married. Jack reveals this to his mother, but she says she knew and did not care. Colleen is also surprised that Jack thought the anniversary of Jimmy leaving would hurt her, noting that he had once left from the spring of 1957 until he came back and invited her to ''[[Some Like It Hot]]''. Jack talks this over with Liz and comes to realize that as ''Some Like It Hot'' was released in 1959, Jimmy Donaghy cannot have been his biological father because Jack was conceived in 1958, during the period Jimmy had been absent.
