'''Sir John A. Macdonald High school''' is a [[Canada|Canadian]] [[high school]] serving the western suburbs of [[Nova Scotia]]'s [[Halifax Regional Municipality]] -- namely the communities of Beechville, Lakeside, Timberlea and Tantallon. Sir John A's feeder schools are Five Bridges Junior High School and [[Ridgecliff Middle School]].

The original Sir John A. Macdonald High School was built in the [[1960s]]. The mascot is the "Flamer," hence the title "Sir John A Flames." The new complex finished construction in 2007.
 
Some time ago the old school in Hubley had trouble with [[uranium]] in the water supply, but since then the school has been converted to 'city' water. In the school year of 2005-2006 the building had another brief run in with contaminated water for a span of three days.{{Fact|date=July 2007}}

The old building for the school was located in the Hubley section of the HRM district. The new Sir John A MacDonald High School is located in Tantallon. The old school is now called Five Bridges Junior High School. The new school was opened in 2006.

The school's principal, Terry Wadden, had his first year at SJA on the 2005-2006 school year. He was formerly the principal of Ridgecliff Middle School, accompanied by Ms. Judy Reynolds.

SJA's home has been moved. The 2005-2006 school year SJA had approximately 1,200 students registered. (Not all of those students attend on a regular basis.) The School has been completed as of [[September 8]], [[2006]] and students currently attend.
