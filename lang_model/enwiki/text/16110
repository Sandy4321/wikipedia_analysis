The album spans several genres, including [[nu metal]], [[Heavy Metal music|heavy metal]], and [[alternative metal]]. Sputnikmusic said that the band takes "take the sound they established on their self titled debut and push it in a darker and, on occasion, more humorous direction." [[Tower Records]] said that the album was "full of shrilly, distorted guitar squeals, bass-heavy darkness and laryngitis-inducing growls," while considering the album to mix the genres [[thrash metal]], [[hip-hop]], [[punk rock]], [[funk]], and [[humor]].

[[Q Magazine]] said that the album was both harsh and hard, and Stephen Thomas Erlewine of [[Allmusic]] said that the album's rhythms were "straight out of underground black metal," while also noting that it "enhanced their metallic influences." With the same band-line up as their previous album, ''[[Korn (album)|Korn]]'', the band created an album cosidered to be darker than their debut album. Entertainment Weekly considered the album to be of interest to "mental-health professionals." Jon Pareles stated that the album's themes characterize Korn being "Mad at Everybody, Including Themselves," and considered his feelings for Korn were mutual. [[iTunes]] said ''Life Is Peachy'' was "a barrage of throttling, detuned guitar aggression that erupts from the bottom like molten lava."

==Front cover and booklet==
[[Image:Korn card.jpg|thumb|right|152px|alt=A square, white paper, with black words asking several questions.|Card in ''Life Is Peachy'']]
Korn's bassist Reginald "Fieldy" Arvizu came up with the title ''Life Is Peachy''. The name came from Fieldy's [[file folder]], with the brand name "Peachy". Fieldy often put "Life Is" in front of the brand name, which would humor him.<ref name="fieldy 79-80"/> Fieldy said, "I used to doodle all over it [the file folder]. I drew long hair on the character and put guitars in their hands. I used to sketch stuff all the time.I eventually knew my scribbles might someday pay off. I thought that visual would make a really cool album cover."<ref name="fieldy 79-80"/> Korn contacted the file folder company "Peachy" and asked for permission to use the file folder's image for an album cover. Offering twenty thousand dollars ($20,000), resulting in the company turning the offer down. The name ''Life Is Peachy'' was agreed by band members to be a "great" name for the album, and kept the name but didn't add Fieldy's file folder cover.<ref name="fieldy 79-80"/>

The front cover of ''Life Is Peachy'' depicts a boy looking in the mirror, seeing a much larger person behind him. The photo was taken by Martin Riedl. The design and concept were by Scott Leberacht. Other pictures in the booklet were taken by Stephen Stickler.<ref>[http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=10:gxfoxqlhld0e~T2 allmusic (((Life Is Peachy > Credits)))] Allmusic. Retrieved 2010-04-12</ref> The booklet has a card, as well as credits. The card consists of questions for the consumer, including their name, address, age, sex, favorite songs from the album, how the listener heard of Korn, and several related personnel questions. On the front of the card, it states where to mail (Fans UV Korn). All credits and track listings throughout the booklet and covers are printed in a [[font]] which represents [[handwriting]]. The only text not printed in this font is the section that gives information about [[Compact disc]]s.
