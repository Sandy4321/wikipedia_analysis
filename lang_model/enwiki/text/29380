{{nihongo|'''''One Missed Call'''''|<U+7740><U+4FE1><U+30A2><U+30EA>|''Chakushin ari''}} is a [[2004 in films|2004]] [[J-Horror]] movie directed by [[Takashi Miike]]. The trademark "ringtone of death" from this film had become rather popular, and was actually used as a ringtone and background music for unofficial [[haunted house]]s.

==Plot==
Yumi Nakamura (Kou Shibasaki) grows concerned when her friend Yoko receives a mysterious message on her cell-phone in her own voice, with a time-stamp in the future. A few days later, at the time appointed on the cell-phone message, Yoko is thrown in front of a train. Though the police determine the death a suicide, Yumi grows even more concerned when another friend receives a threatening message on his cell-phone, presaging another death.

Yumi is approached by Yamashita Hiroshi (Tsutsumi Shinichi), whose sister's death was also linked to an odd cell-phone message, and the two team up to solve the mystery. They are unable to prevent the death of another of Yumi's friends, but soon trace the calls back to the case of a woman whose daughters were regularly admitted to a local hospital with suspicious injuries. The two investigate the woman's last known whereabouts, an abandoned hospital. Once there, Yumi confronts a vengeful ghost in an attempt to break the chain of violent deaths.

==Sequels and remakes==

*[[Warner Bros.]] remade the film into an American version entitled ''[[One Missed Call (2008 film)|One Missed Call]]''.
*''[[One Missed Call (TV series)|One Missed Call]]'', also known as ''Chakushin Ari - the TV series'', is a 2005 ten-episode [[List of Japanese television dramas|Japanese television drama]] that followed the films. It was released in a five-box set in Japan without subtitles, and also in Malaysia, in an English-subtitled three-DVD set, under the title ''Ghost Ring''.

==Alternate versions==
The film has an alternate ending where after Yumi spits the candy into Yamashita's mouth, it cuts to Tendo, the exorcist, wearing casts on his arms and legs. He gets a missed call on his cell phone, but unlike the other victims, his message is from a few seconds in the future and not three days. He's then killed in a humorous fashion when a metal basin falls on his head.
