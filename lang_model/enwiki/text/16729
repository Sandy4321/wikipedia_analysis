'''Parma Football Club''' (formerly '''Parma Associazione Calcio'''), commonly referred to as just '''Parma''', is an [[Italy|Italian]] professional [[association football|football]] club based in [[Parma]], [[Emilia<U+2013>Romagna]] that will be compete in [[Serie A]] for the [[2011<U+2013>12 Serie A|2011<U+2013>12 season]], having finished in twelfth position [[Serie A 2010<U+2013>11|last season]].

Although Parma have never won a [[Serie A|domestic league title]] and never competed for major trophies until the 1990s, they have won three [[Coppa Italia|Italian Cups]], one [[Supercoppa Italiana]], as well as two [[UEFA Cup]]s, one [[European Super Cup]] and one [[UEFA Cup Winners' Cup]].<ref name="Parma honours">{{Cite web|url=http://www.fcparma.com/storia/palmares.html|title=Palmares|trans_title=Honours|accessdate=30 July 2010|language=Italian|work=Official Parma F.C. website}}</ref> The club won all eight of these trophies between 1992 and 2002, a period in which it is also achieved its best ever league finish <U+2013> as runners-up in the [[1996<U+2013>97 Serie A|1996<U+2013>97 season]] <U+2013> and threatened the dominance of the league's established powers: [[Juventus F.C.|Juventus]], [[A.C.

The club was founded in July 1913 as '''Verdi Football Club''' in honour of famous opera composer [[Giuseppe Verdi]], who was born in the province of [[Province of Parma|Parma]], adopting its yellow and blue as its In December of the year, the club changed its name to '''Parma Football Club''' and began wearing white shirts emblazoned with a black cross.<ref name="Goal history">{{cite web|url=http://www.goal.com/it/teams/italy/4/parma/info|title=Parma|publisher=goal.com|accessdate=5 January 2011}}</ref> Parma began playing league football during the 1919<U+2013>20 season and launched plans to build a stadium <U+2013> [[Stadio Ennio Tardini]] <U+2013> for the club two years later. Parma became founder members of [[Serie B]] after finishing runners-up in the Prima Divisione in the 1928<U+2013>29 season, where would remain for three years before being relegated and changing name to '''Associazione Sportiva Parma'''. In the [[Serie_C_1935<U+2013>36#Girone_B|1935<U+2013>36 season]], Parma became founding members of [[Serie C]], where they would remain until they secured a return to [[Serie B]] in [[Serie_C_1942<U+2013>43#Girone_G|1943]].

Italian football was then brought to a halt as World War II intensified, although Parma did make an appearance in the [[1944_Campionato_Alta_Italia#Group_D|Campianto Alta Italia]] in 1944. Following the restart of organised football, Parma enjoyed three years in [[Serie B]], then split into two regional divisions, before again being relegated in [[Serie_B_1948<U+2013>49#Girone_B|1948<U+2013>49]] to Serie C, where they would spend another five seasons before an eleven-year spell in [[Serie B]], including the achievement of ninth position in [[Serie B 1954-55|1954<U+2013>55]], a club record at that time. Parma also made their debut on the European stage during the 1960<U+2013>61 season, defeating [[Switzerland|Swiss]] side [[AC Bellinzona]] in the [[Coppa delle Alpi]], but relegation to Serie C followed in [[Serie B 1964<U+2013>65|1964<U+2013>65 season]]. Parma spent just one season in Serie C before they were relegated for a second successive season and found themselves in [[Serie D]] in 1966. The club was in turmoil and, having been ordered into liquidation by the Court of Parma in 1968, and failure in 1969.

===Yo-yoing between leagues (1968<U+2013>1989)===
Towards the end of the 1970s, another local team, ''A.C. Parmense'' won the fifth tier division, the [[Prima Categoria]], and were promoted to Serie D before being absorbed by Parma, bringing about a change of name to '''Parma Associazione Calcio''' and a change of fortune in both financial and sporting terms, as it was followed by the crowning as champions of Serie D and a three-year stint in Serie C, which led to Parma finding themselves back in Serie B.<ref name="Early history and stadium info"/> However, it was a brief sojourn in Serie B as they were relegated in their first season in the division. A return to Serie B did not materialise until the end of the 1970s and again the club lasted just one season in the second tier of Italian football.

Under [[Cesare Maldini]]'s management Parma again returned to Serie B after winning their division in [[Serie_C1_1983<U+2013>84#Serie_C1.2FA_2|1984]] with final day victory over [[San Remo]] with [[Juventus]]-bound Stefano Poli scoring the only goal of the game. ''Il Ducali'' against spent just one year in [[Serie B 1984-85|Serie B]] before a return under was shorter than hoped as they spent just one season in the league, finishing third from bottom and being relegated as a result. [[Arrigo Sacchi]] returned the club to Serie B in 1986 and the club finally managed to stay there under the stewardship of [[Zden<U+011B>k Zeman]] and Giampieri Vitali. [[Nevio Scala]] was appointed manager in 1989.

===Success with Scala (1989<U+2013>1996)===
Scala's Parma secured a historic promotion in [[Serie B 1989-90|1990]] to [[Serie A]], finishing fourth.<ref name="Parma '90s blog">{{Cite web|url=http://ghostgoal.co.uk/2010/05/19/parma-90s-phenomenon/|title=Parma: '90s Phenomenon|accessdate=31 July 2010|date=19 May 2010}}</ref> Scala supplemented the squad that achieved promotion from Serie B with players like [[Tomas Brolin]] and [[Claudio Taffarel]], as [[Calisto Tanzi|Tanzi]] and his family increased their stake.<ref name="Parma '90s blog"/> Parma ended ther first ever season in Serie A in sixth place, qualifying for the [[UEFA Cup]].<ref name="Parma '90s blog"/> However, Parma exited the [[UEFA Cup 1991<U+2013>92|1991<U+2013>92]] in the first round. The club had more success on the domestic front, finishing sixth in the [[1991<U+2013>92 Serie A|league]] and prevailing in the [[1991<U+2013>92 Coppa Italia|Coppa Italia]] final after losing the away leg 1<U+2013>0, but winning the second leg 2<U+2013>0 at home. In 1992, Parma's squad was further improved by summer arrivals, which helped them to their first international triumph when goals from [[captain (association football)|captain]] [[Lorenzo Minotti]], [[Alessandro Melli]] and [[Stefano Cuoghi]] secured a 3<U+2013>1 victory in the [[1993 European Cup Winners' Cup Final|Cup Winners' Cup]] over Belgian side [[Royal Antwerp|Antwerp]] at [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley]].<ref name="Parma '90s blog"/><ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.football-italia.net/topten/eurounderdogs.html | accessdate=12 December 2010 | last=Wilson | first=Steve | title=Top 10...Euro underdogs | work=Football Italia}}</ref> They also managed a record high finish of third place.

[[Image:Coccarda Coppa Italia.svg|thumb|right|150px|The patch worn over Parma's badge in the seasons following their three [[Coppa Italia]] triumphs]]

The following season, the club were successful in the [[European Super Cup]], beating [[A.C. Milan|AC Milan]].<ref name="Parma '90s blog"/> Having lost the first leg 1<U+2013>0 at home, an extra time goal from [[Massimo Crippa]] enough for 2<U+2013>1 aggregate Parma victory. The same season, however, they [[1994 European Cup Winners' Cup Final|lost the Cup Winners' Cup]] 1<U+2013>0 in the final against [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] and slipped to 5th in the [[1993<U+2013>94 Serie A|league]]. The next year, bolstered by further acquisitions,<ref name="Parma '90s blog"/> Parma would again face Juventus in a two-legged final; this time in the [[UEFA Cup]]. Dino Baggio scored the only goal of the first leg <U+2013> played in Parma <U+2013> and he scored again in the second leg, which was staged in Milan, to give Parma a [[1995 UEFA Cup Final|2<U+2013>1 aggregate win]] and a second major European trophy. Parma lost the two-legged [[Coppa Italia 1994-95|Coppa Italia]] final to Juventus by the same scoreline. A trophy-less 1995<U+2013>96 meant that Nevio Scala was replaced by [[Carlo Ancelotti]].

===Tanzi era (1996<U+2013>2002)===
The team was again overhauled as [[Hern<U+00E1>n Crespo]], [[Enrico Chiesa]] and [[Jos<U+00E9> Marcelo Ferreira|Z<U+00E9> Maria]] all signed, while [[Gianfranco Zola]] was sold to [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] for [[Pound sterling|<U+00A3>]]4.5 million.<ref name="Parma '90s blog"/><ref>{{cite news | url=http://soccernet.espn.go.com/news/story?id=733646&sec=europe&cc=5739 | date=30 January 2010 | accessdate=15 December 2010 | title=Crespo "speechless" after making Parma return | publisher=ESPN}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news| date=24 May 2005 | url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,762-1624346,00.html | title=Tactical switch | publisher=The Times | accessdate=20 July 2010 | location=London | first=Gabriele | last=Marcotti}}</ref> Ancelotti guided to a club record second place in [[1996-97 Serie A|1997]] and Parma consequently made their debut in the [[UEFA Champions League|Champions League]], but progress from the group stages was not completed.

Despite a disappointing finish in fourth place in [[1998<U+2013>99 Serie A|Serie A]], this season remains Parma's most successful ever, completing a rare cup double, winning the [[Coppa Italia 1998-99|Coppa Italia final]] on the [[away goals rule]] after playing out two legs against [[Fiorentina]] as well as the UEFA Cup, after a comfortable 3<U+2013>0 victory over [[Olympique de Marseille|Marseille]] at the [[Luzhniki Stadium]] in Moscow.

[[Italian Super Cup]] victory over league champions A.C. Milan was contrasted with early [[UEFA Champions League 1999-00|Champions League]] elimination at the hands of [[Rangers F.C.|Rangers]] and a fifth-place finish in [[Serie A 1999-00|the league]]. The following summer saw the sale of Crespo to [[S.S. Lazio|Lazio]] for a [[World football transfer record|world record transfer fee]]. Parma's start to the following season led to the sacking of Malesani, a brief spell under Arrigo Sacchi and the appointment of new coach [[Renzo Ulivieri]], who led the side to fourth in the league. Parma lost the [[Coppa Italia 2000<U+2013>01|Coppa Italia]] final to [[ACF Fiorentina|Fiorentina]] 2<U+2013>1 on aggegrate in 2001 and Ulivieri was sacked in October of [[Serie A 2001-02|the next season]] after a poor start. Things did not improve under [[Daniel Passarella]] and he too was fired. [[Pietro Carmignani]]'s subsequent appointment provided a third Coppa Italia trophy in [[2002 Coppa Italia Final|2002]], yet again facing Juventus and emerging victorious on the away goals rule. Parma's success in the 1990s and early 2000s earned them a tag as one of the [[Seven Sisters#Sport|Seven Sisters]].<ref name="Seventh sister">{{Cite news| url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/blog/2009/nov/23/parma-seventh-sister-serie-a | title=Seventh sister back on the scene as Parma perk up sibling rivalry | publisher=The Guardian | accessdate=9 December 2010 | location=London | first=Paolo | last=Bandini | date=23 November 2009}}</ref><ref name="sister meltdown">{{cite news| url=http://www.financialexpress.com/news/parma-is-latest-in-italys-seven-sisters-of-soccer-to-crumble/40612/| title=Parma Is Latest In Italy<U+2019>s <U+2018>Seven Sisters<U+2019> Of Soccer To Crumble| publisher=The Financial Express |accessdate=9 December 2010 |date=10 January 2004}}</ref>

{{Main|Parma F.C. strip}}

Parma is characterised by having used two different colour schemes during its recent memory, as well as at their inception. Originally, the club wore yellow and blue shirts in honour of the city's traditional colours, which date back to 1545 when the [[Duchy of Parma]] was established,<ref name="Parma kits">{{Cite web|url=http://www.heraldica.org/topics/national/italy2.htm#parma|title=Heraldry in Pre-Unification Italy|work=Heraldica|accessdate=30 July 2010}}</ref> but white shirts with a black [[cross]] on the chest were introduced at the end of the year of the club's foundation, drawing inspiration from [[Juventus]]' colours, following a name change.<ref name="Goal history"/> White continued to be worn as the main colour of the home kits for much of the remainder of the century, although often complemented with yellow, blue or both, rather than black. The club did, however, wear blue shirts with white shorts in 1950.

After decades in the lower divisions, Parma were promoted to Serie A in 1990, where they immediately became a major force in the battle for major trophies, on many notable occasions in direct opposition to Juventus, who would become fierce rivals of Parma's. This rivalry rapidly led to the demotion of the white and black shirts to the away kit, so the side wore yellow and blue hooped shirts at home for six seasons between 1998 and 2004, with navy blue shirts often worn as third choice in this period. This was a time of great success for the club, thus the shirts have become synonymous with Parma, often still called the ''Gialloblu'' (Yellow and Blues) today, despite a recent reversion to the traditional white shirts emblazoned with a cross caused by parent company [[Parmalat]]'s collapse and the clubs subsequent re-foundation as Parma Football Club. Yellow and blue are now Parma's away kit colours, used in various combinations since 2004, such as vertical stripes, hoops, crosses or as solid colour designs.<ref>{{Cite web| url=http://www.storiadelparmacalcio.com/collezione-parma/collezione-maglie-parma.htm | title=Le Maglie del Parma | trans_title=The Kits of Parma | work = La Storia del Parma Calcio}}</ref>
[[File:Parma-AC.png|thumb|150px|right|The old Parma A.C. logo, used until the name change to Parma F.C. in 2004]]

In the 2010<U+2013>11 season, Parma are wearing four different kits. Their first kit bears the traditional black cross on a white shirt, this season adorned with yellow and blue trim on the collar and sleeves, along with black shorts and socks, topped with a more conspicuous badge similar to that used in 1993<U+2013>94. The away kit is a blue shirt with yellow sleeves and shorts and blue socks, drawing on inspiration from kits worn in 1953<U+2013>54, 1955<U+2013>56 and 1956<U+2013>57. It uses the same colours as the special edition Coppa Italia kit, worn only in that competition, which is a blue and yellow vertically striped shirt, complemented with blue shorts and yellow socks. The third kit uses colours not often used over the years by the club; a grey shirt with a single yellow hoop outlined with two blue hoops and a blue colour.<ref>{{Cite web| url=http://www.tuttomercatoweb.com/parma/?action=read&idnet=c3BvcnRzYm9vazI0Lm5ldC0xNDczMw | accessdate=7 August 2010 | date=4 August 2010 | title=Parma, le maglie della stagione 2010/2011! | trans_title=Parma, the kit for the 2010/2011 season!}}</ref>

Parma's logo changed in 2005 to reflect the name change from Parma A.C. to Parma F.C., but the logo otherwise remains the same, encompassing the city colours of yellow and blue and the club's traditional black cross set on a white background, and has not changed much in many years, although it was dramatically overhauled to feature a prancing bull for one season in 2000<U+2013>01 before it was criticised and discontinued in favour of the old badge.

==Grounds==
===Stadium===
{{Main|Stadio Ennio Tardini}}
[[File:Ennio Tardini.JPG|left|thumb|[[Stadio Ennio Tardini]], Parma's home stadium]]
Parma initially had no permanent home, initially using the ''Piazza d'Armi'', where two wooden posts constituted the frame of the goal. In December 1914, the club began to use land between the [[Via Emilia]], the Eridania refinery and the Ferraguti factory, but it was sold, so the club returned to the ''Piazza d'Armi'' before transferring to the ''Tre Pioppi'', the first fenced-off pitch in the city.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.apcpetitot.it/associazione/storia_tardini.html|publisher=www.apcpetitot.it|work=Associazione Parma Club Petitot|title=La storia dello stadio "Ennio Tardini" di Parma (1923)|trans_title=The history of Parma's Stadio Ennio Tardini (1923)}}</ref> Parma moved into their current stadium, the [[Stadio Ennio Tardini]], in 1923 and have called it home ever since, although the stadium has since been overhauled and altered drastically from the vision of [[Ennio Tardini]], under whose auspices the stadium was to be built, but who died before completion of the venue.<ref name="Early history and stadium info"/> Much of the renovation took place after the club's first promotion to [[Serie A]] at the start of the 1990s. The stadium's usable capacity stands at 27,906, but only 22,885 are authorised to enter at once.

Expansion or renovation plans are often discussed at the highest level of the club's hierarchy and the [[Parma|Comune di Parma]], but no project has received unanimous support. This is partly because the football club rent the stadium and often have interests which conflict with those of the municipal authority. The currently tenancy expires in 2031. One project which both club and council had agreed on was the potential redevelopment for [[Italy]]'s potential hosting of [[UEFA Euro 2016|Euro 2016]]. The [[UEFA Euro 2016 bids#Italy|bid]] was eventually unsuccessfully, but included plans for an improved 31,397 all-seater stadium.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.settorecrociatoparma.it/Notizie0910..htm/notizie_0910_403.htm | work=settorecrociatoparma.it | date=16 February 2010 | accessdate=13 December 2010 | trans_title=Here are the features of the renovation plans | title=Ecco le caratteristiche del progetto di ristrutturazione}}</ref> An alternative to the development of the Tardini is the construction of a new stadium. Recent reports suggest that the stadium is unfit for use in [[UEFA]] competitions due to the inadequacy of its seating.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stadiotardini.com/2011/05/licenza-uefa-quanto-scottano-quei.html|title=LICENZA UEFA / QUANTO SCOTTANO QUEI SEGGIOLINI !|date=21 May 2011|language=Italian}}</ref>

===Training ground===
The first team train and play many of their home friendly matches at Centro Sportivo Parma Calcio, [[Collecchio]], which is located 15.4 kilometres to the south-west of the stadium. Three of Parma's [[Parma F.C. Academy|youth teams]] <U+2013> the under-20s, the under-17s and the under-16s <U+2013> play their home matches in the same complex. The arrangement spans 114,000 square metres and seven pitches, one of which includes a 1,200-seat grandstand, which sits atop the main building, which is home to a locker room, a therapy room, medical offices and a gym. It also houses the offices of both the manager and the president, as well as a press room. Recently, the installation of a pitch with synthetic grass in a caged area has been completed.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fcparma.com/citta-e-stadio/cs-di-collecchio.html|title=CS Collecchio|trans_title=Collecchio Sports Centre|accessdate=26 December 2010|work=Parma F.C.|publisher=fcparma.com}}</ref> The under-15s and below train at Campi Stuard.<ref name="Youth teams">{{cite news | url=http://www.fcparma.com/settore-giovanile/archivio-settore-giovanile/7036-calendario-ripresa-attivita-del-settore-giovanile.html | work= Parma F.C. | title=Calendario ripresa attivit<U+00E1> del Settore Giovanile | language = Italian | trans_title=Youth Sector Pre-Season Activity Timetable| date=30 June 2010 | accessdate= 3 August 2010}}</ref>

==Support==
The supporters of Parma are represented by three main groups: ''il Centro di Coordinamento dei Parma Club'' (which represents the majority of the fanbase), ''l'Associazione Petitot'' and the club's [[ultras]], ''Boys Parma'', which was established on 3 August 1977 by young fans wanting to split from the Centro di Coordinamento and to encourage meetings with opposition fans.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.boysparma1977.it/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=198:breve-riassunto&catid=49:annoperanno&Itemid=75|title=Breve Riassunto|trans_title=Brief Summary|language=Italian|accessdate=19 December 2010}}</ref> The Boys Parma occupy the northern end of the home stadium, ''La Curva Nord'', directly opposite to where the away fans sit in the south stand.<ref name="Early history and stadium info"/> In 2008, the Curva Nord was re-named in honour of Boys Parma 1977 member Matteo Bagnaresi, who died when he was run over on the way to the Tardini by a coach which was carrying the opposition [[Juventus]] fans.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2008/mar/31/europeanfootball.sport1|publisher=guardian.co.uk|work=The Guardian|first=Paolo|last=Bandini|date=31 March 2008|title=Sadness and censure as violence blights the Scudetto again}}</ref>  In a not uncommon practice, the [[Retired numbers in association football#Dedication to fans|number 12 shirt has been reserved]] for the Parma fans, meaning that no player is currently registered to play with that number on his kit for the club. The implication is that the supporters, particularly those of the famous Curva Nord, are the [[12th man (football)|twelfth man]]. The last player to be registered with the number was Gabriele Giroli for the 2002<U+2013>03 season. Parma's club anthem is ''Il grido di battaglia'', which means ''The Battle Cry''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://parma.theoffside.com/italy/random-parma-video-8-parmas-anthem.html|title=Random Parma Video 8- Parma<U+2019>s Anthem|date=22 January 2008}}</ref>

===Rivalries===
Parma maintain several rivalries with regional and national clubs; some of these are keenly fought [[local derby|local derbies]]. [[Juventus]] are now considered Parma's greatest rivals largely due to their recent duels, which include Parma's [[1995 UEFA Cup Final|1995 UEFA Cup victory]], their [[1991<U+2013>92 Coppa Italia|first]] and [[2002 Coppa Italia Final|third Coppa Italia]] triumphs and [[Supercoppa Italiana]] defeats in [[1995 Supercoppa Italiana|1995]] and [[1995 Supercoppa Italiana|2002]], as well as their [[1994<U+2013>95 Coppa Italia|1995]] domestic cup final defeat to ''The Old Lady''.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://parma.theoffside.com/italy/parma-juve-like-a-derby.html | work=The Offside | title=Parma-Juve, Like a Derby | accessdate=14 December 2010| date=8 November 2007}}</ref> These six matches comprise nearly half of the fourteen major finals that Parma have participated in. Ironically, Parma's colours have their origins in those that Juventus wear, and the switch from white and black to a yellow and blue home kit in the late 1990s was initiated in order to distance and distinguish Parma from Juventus. ''Derby dell'Enza''<ref>This translates to ''Enza Derby''; the River Enza is an affluence of Italy's longest river, the [[Po (river)|Po]], and forms the boundary of the [[Provinces of Italy|provinces]] of [[Province of Parma|Parma]] and [[Province of Reggio Emilia|Reggio Emilia]].</ref> opponents [[Reggiana]] are considered Parma's second biggest rivals due to their close proximity. The ''Derby dei Ducati''<ref>This translates to ''Duchies Derby''; the duchies of [[Duchy of Modena and Reggio|Modena and Reggio]] and [[Duchy of Parma|Parma]] were competing and neighbouring duchies during the [[Renaissance]].</ref> is contested against neighbours [[Modena F.C.|Modena]]. Parma also maintain keenly fought rivalries with [[Vicenza Calcio|Vicenza]], [[Bologna FC|Bologna]]<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.football-italia.net/dec19g.html|publisher=Football Italia|work=football-italia.net|title=Malesani recalls Tardini triumphs|date=19 December 2010|accessdate=19 December 2010}}</ref> (with whom they contest the ''Derby d'Emilia''<ref>This translates to ''Emilian Derby''; it approximately corresponds to the western and north-eastern portions of today<U+2019>s [[Emilia-Romagna]] region and takes its name from the [[Via Aemilia]], a Roman road in 187 BCE.</ref> in the duel between [[Emilia<U+2013>Romagna]]'s two biggest clubs<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.football-italia.net/sa1011/bol-par.html|publisher=Football Italia|work=football-italia.net|title=Bologna - Parma}}</ref>) and [[Genoa C.F.C.|Genoa]], while [[U.S. Cremonese|Cremonese]] also remain rivals of Parma, despite playing in the third tier of Italian football <U+2013> two divisions below Parma. The ''Derby del Ducato''<ref>This  translates to ''Duchy Derby''; the Duchy of Parma was created in 1545 and became the unified Duchies of Parma and Piacenza in 1556.</ref> is played against [[Piacenza Calcio|Piacenza]]. Conversely, Parma enjoy an amicable rivalry with [[Empoli F.C.|Empoli]], which dates back to a game played in foggy conditions in [[Serie B 1984<U+2013>85|1984]] that ended in the Parma fans congratulating those of Empoli on their win when the full-time whistle was blown without the ''Azzurri'' fans' knowledge,<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.football-italia.net/topten/twins.html | work=Football Italia | title=Top 10: Twinned clubs | accessdate=12 December 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.boysparma1977.it/index.php?option=com_content&view=section&id=12&Itemid=78|accessdate=19 December 2010|title=Empoli|work=Boys Parma|publisher=boysparma1977.it}}</ref> and another with fans of [[Sampdoria]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.boysparma1977.it/index.php?option=com_content&view=section&id=13&Itemid=79|accessdate=19 December 2010|title=Sampdoria|work=Boys Parma|publisher=boysparma1977.it}}</ref>

==Parma Football Club as a company==
Since January 2007, the club has been owned [[Tommaso Ghirardi]]. [[Enrico Bondi]] had previously been put in charge of selling the club after parent company [[Parmalat]]'s financial crisis and sold it to Ghirardi for less than <U+20AC>3m. The club is one of the members of the [[European Club Association]], which was formed after the dissolution of the [[G-14]], a smaller international group of Europe's most elite clubs of which Parma were not a part.<ref name="ECA1"/><ref name="ECA2"/> The club reported a revenue of <U+20AC>43.6m for the 2009<U+2013>10 season, profit on player sales of <U+20AC>34.7m and costs of <U+20AC>71.4m, meaning a post-tax loss of <U+20AC>2.4m. Post-tax losses in 2008<U+2013>09, the season spent in Serie B, were <U+20AC>9.9m. Net assets of the club stand at <U+20AC>12.8m, while bank debts are <U+20AC>12.5m.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://swissramble.blogspot.com/2011/04/fiorentina-most-profitable-club-in.html|title=Fiorentina - The Most Profitable Club in Serie A|publisher=swissramble.blogspot.com|date=4 April 2011|accessdate=4 April 2011|work=The Swiss Ramble}}</ref> Excluding gate receipts and television income given to visiting clubs, as well as revenue from player loans, this revenue drops to around <U+20AC>37m, <U+20AC>5m of which is matchday revenue, <U+20AC>20m of which is television revenue and <U+20AC>12m of which is commercial revenue. These figures are largely unexceptional and make the club the 14th highest revenue in [[Serie A]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://swissramble.blogspot.com/2011/04/napolis-success-story.html|title=Napoli's Success Story|publisher=swissramble.blogspot.com|date=21 April 2011|accessdate=21 April 2011|work=The Swiss Ramble}}</ref>  Director [[Pietro Leonardi]] noted that the profit made in January 2011 on player sales was enough to finally undo the economic damage that the 2008 relegation to [[Serie B]] caused.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.stadiotardini.com/2011/01/debito-saldato-anche-quello-economico.html|title=DEBITO SALDATO.

To improve the financial standing of the club, there are hopes to eventually buy the [[Stadio Ennio Tardini]] from the relevant municipal authority.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.stadiotardini.com/2010/04/e-dopo-la-tessera-lo-stadio-di.html|title=E dopo la Tessera, lo stadio di propriet<U+00E0>....|publisher=stadiotardini.com|date=23 April 2010|access date-5 January 2011}}</ref> In September 2010, the club had the twelfth highest annual salary bill in Italian football, paying <U+20AC>20.7m to 25 players at an average of around <U+20AC>16,000 per player per week.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.gazzetta.it/Calcio/SerieA/07-09-2010/paghe-un-miliardo-711054690589.shtml|accessdate=6 January 2011|date=7 September 2010|title=Tutti gli stipendi di serie A Ingaggi tagliati?

The domestic rights to broadcast live matches for those two seasons were sold for <U+20AC>1.149bn to [[Sky Italia]], while the domestic highlights package cost [[RAI]] <U+20AC>30m, and MP & Silva bought the worldwide rights for <U+20AC>181.5m.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://fourfourtwo.com/news/italy/54068/default.aspx|date=13 May 2010|accessdate=5 January 2011|publisher=fourfourtwo.com|work=FourFourTwo|title=Italian clubs cross fingers over TV ruling

All of Parma's league matches are broadcast on [[Dahlia TV]], but [[Mediaset Premium]] also air their away matches. Parma's [[Coppa Italia]] matches from the Round of 16 onwards are all shown on [[RAI]].

===Sponsorship===
Parma have had their kits manufactured and been sponsored by a variety of companies since 1981, including parent company Parmalat for a period of eight years.<ref name="Parma kits"/> Their kits are presently manufactured by the global [[Erre<U+00E0>]] sportswear brand, whose origins are in [[Torrile]], which is approximately 13 kilometres north of Parma. The club's principal sponsor is clothing retailer [[Navigare]]. Local bank [[Banca Monte Parma]] is the secondary kit sponsor, while [[Sky Italia]] and [[Bottega del Sarto]] are the club's media sponsor and fashion partner, respectively. The club's other platinum sponsors are Japanese television and film production company [[Sony Pictures]], telecommunications group [[Telecom Italia Mobile|TIM]], restaurant chain Fresh Good, [[South Korea]]n [[automaker|automobile manufacturer]] [[Kia Motors|Kia]], [[television channel]] [[Disney XD]] and household retailer [[Vorwerk (company)|Vorwerk]]. The club maintain several other less prominent partnerships.<ref>{{Cite web| url=http://www.fcparma.com/marketing/sponsor.html | accessdate=26 December 2010 | title=Sponsor | trans_title=Sponsorship | work=Parma F.C. | publisher=fcparma.com}}</ref>
