'''Patterson''' is a [[residential area|residential]] neighbourhood in the south-west quadrant of [[Calgary]], [[Alberta]]. It is bounded by Sarcee Trail to the east and north, Bow Trail to the south, 69 Street to the west and Old Banff Coach Road to the south. [[Edworthy Park]], developed in the [[Bow River]] valley, borders the community to the north and east.

It is represented in the [[Calgary City Council]] by Ward 6 [[Alderman]] Craig Burrows.<ref>{{Cite web| author= Federation of Calgary Communities | url= http://www.calgaryarea.com/sw/coachhill/coachhill.htm |title= Patterson Community| accessdate= 2007-05-12}}</ref> 

==History==
Before annexation, the area consisted of mostly acreages. It was named after the Patterson family, who owned much of the land. Prior to that, it was knows as ''Broadcast Hill'', for the {{m to ft|250|abbr=yes}} [[CFCN-TV|CFCN]] re-transmission tower located here.

Originally, the [[University of Alberta]] was to be located on the site of the present day community; however, [[Edmonton]] was ultimately chosen as the site of the campus.<ref name=stratconaA>{{Cite web| url= http://www.calgary.ca/docgallery/BU/planning/pdf/patterson_heights_rev_concept_plan.pdf | title=Patterson Heights (Strathcona Cell "A"): Revised Concept Plan and Supporting Information| author=City of Calgary| year=2006| accessdate= 2007-07-22}}</ref>

The lands were annexed to the city of Calgary in 1956 and Patterson Heights was established as a neighborhood in 1983. During the planning phase, in the early 1980s, Patterson Heights was referred to as Strathcona Cell "A".<ref name=stratconaA/>

During the [[XV Olympic Winter Games]] in 1988, the Broadcast Hill Media Village was located in Patterson Heights. The apartments have since been converted into condominiums.

==Demographics== 
In 2006 the neighbourhood had a population of 4,141.<ref name=popcalgary>{{Cite web| url=http://www.calgary.ca/DocGallery/BU/cityclerks/popcomparisonbycomm.pdf | author= City of Calgary | title= Community Population Comparison | year=2006 | accessdate= 2007-05-12}}</ref> Residents in this community had a [[median household income]] of [[Canadian dollar|$]]78,786 in 2000, and there were 8.9% low income residents living in the neighborhood.<ref name=ward>{{Cite web| url= http://www.calgary.ca/docgallery/bu/cns/community_social_statistics/ward_6_profile.pdf | title=Ward 6 Profile| author=City of Calgary| year=2004| accessdate= 2007-05-12}}</ref> As of 2000, 23.8% of the residents were [[immigrant]]s.
