'''Chatyr-Dag''' ({{lang-crh|<U+00C7>at<U+0131>r Da<U+011F>}}, {{lang-uk|<U+0427><U+0430><U+0442><U+0438><U+0440>-<U+0414><U+0430><U+0433>}}, {{lang-ru|<U+0427><U+0430><U+0442><U+044B><U+0440>-<U+0414><U+0430><U+0433>}}) is a [[mountainous massif]] in [[Crimea]], near [[Simferopol]]-[[Alushta]] highway. In the [[Crimean Tatar language]] ''<U+00E7>at<U+0131>r'' means tent and ''da<U+011F>'' means mountain.

The mountain consists of two plateaus: the lower (north) and the upper (south). The lower plateau slopes gently down to its northern side, which is covered in [[steppe]] grass. On its southern end (near the steep slope of the higher plateau), the lower plateau is covered with [[beech]] forests and [[juniper]] glades. It has many hiking trails and several beautiful [[cave]]s (see a list below). On the east side of the lower plateau there is an outpost grove of [[Taxus|yews]].

The upper plateau has a shape of a giant bowl and on its brim, the highest peaks are each named. The upper plateau is covered with [[alpine meadow]]s. Its slopes are very steep and offer some routes for multipitch climbing (that's rock climbing routes, longer than length of one climbing rope). The highest peak is Eklizi-Bourun (1527m. above sea level)
