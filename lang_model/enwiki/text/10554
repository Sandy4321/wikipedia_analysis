The recorded '''history of Mars observation''' dates back to the era of the ancient [[Egyptian astronomy|Egyptian astronomers]] in the [[2nd millennium BCE]]. Detailed observations of the position of [[Mars]] were made by [[Babylonian astronomy|Babylonian astronomers]] who developed arithmetic techniques to predict the future position of the planet. The ancient [[Greek philosophy|Greek philosophers]] and [[Hellenistic astronomy|Hellenistic]] [[astronomers]] developed a [[geocentric model]] to explain the planet's motions. [[Indian astronomy|Indian]] and [[Astronomy in medieval Islam|Islamic]] astronomers estimated the size of Mars and its distance from Earth. In the 16th century, [[Nicholas Copernicus]] proposed a [[Heliocentrism|heliocentric model]] for the [[Solar System]] in which the planets follow circular orbits about the [[Sun]]. This was revised by [[Johannes Kepler]], yielding an [[elliptic orbit]] for Mars that more accurately fitted the observational data.

The first [[Telescope|telescopic]] observation of Mars was by [[Galileo Galilei]] in 1610. Within a century, astronomers discovered distinct [[albedo]] features on the planet, including the dark patch [[Syrtis Major Planum]] and [[polar ice cap]]s. They were able to determine the planet's [[rotation period]] and [[axial tilt]]. These observations were primarily made during the time intervals when the planet was located in [[Opposition (planets)|opposition]] to the Sun, at which points Mars made its closest approaches to the Earth.

Better telescopes developed early in the 19th century allowed permanent Martian [[albedo]] features to be mapped in detail. The first crude map of Mars was published in 1840, followed by more refined maps from 1877 onward. When astronomers mistakenly thought they had detected the [[Absorption line|spectroscopic signature]] of water in the Martian atmosphere, the idea of life on Mars became [[wikt:popularise|popularized]] among the public. [[Percival Lowell]] believed he could see an artificial network of [[Martian canal|canals on Mars]]. These linear features later proved to be an [[optical illusion]], and the atmosphere was found to be too thin to support an [[Planetary habitability|Earth-like environment]].

Yellow clouds on Mars have been observed since the 1870s, which [[Eug<U+00E8>ne M. Antoniadi]] suggested were windblown sand or dust. During the 1920s, the range of Martian surface temperature was measured; it ranged from {{convert|-85|C|F|abbr=on|0}} up to {{convert|7|C|F|abbr=on|0}}. The planetary atmosphere was found to be arid with only trace amounts of oxygen and water. In 1947, [[Gerard Kuiper]] showed that the thin Martian atmosphere contained extensive [[carbon dioxide]]; roughly double the quantity found in Earth's atmosphere. The first standard nomenclature for Mars albedo features was adopted in 1960 by the [[International Astronomical Union]]. Since the 1960s, multiple robotic [[spacecraft]] have been sent to explore Mars from orbit and the surface. The planet has remained under observation by ground and space-based instruments across a broad range of the [[electromagnetic spectrum]]. The discovery of [[meteorite]]s on Earth that [[Mars meteorite|originated on Mars]] has allowed laboratory examination of the chemical conditions on the planet.

==Earliest records==
[[File:Retrograde Motion.bjb.svg|thumb|right|As Earth passes Mars, the latter planet will temporarily appear to reverse its
motion across the sky.|alt=At left are two concentric circles around a disk. Lines from the circles are projected on a star chart at right, demonstrating the S-shaped motion of Mars]]
The existence of Mars as a wandering object in the night sky was recorded by ancient [[Egyptian astronomy|Egyptian astronomers]]. By the 2nd millennium BCE they were familiar with the [[apparent retrograde motion]] of the planet, where it appears to move in the opposite direction across the sky from its normal progression.<ref name=paob85/> Mars was portrayed on the ceiling of the tomb of [[Seti I]], the [[Ramesseum]] ceiling,<ref name=marshall89/> and the [[Senenmut]] star map. The last is the oldest known star map, being dated to 1534 BCE based on the position of the planets.<ref name=paob85/>

By the period of the [[Neo-Babylonian Empire]], [[Babylonian astronomers]] were making systematic observations of the positions and behavior of the planets. For Mars, they knew, for example, that the planet made 37 [[synodic period]]s, or 42 circuits of the zodiac, every 79 years. The Babylonians invented arithmetic methods for making minor corrections to the predicted positions of the planets. This technique was primarily derived from timing measurements<U+2014>such as when Mars rose above the horizon, rather than from the less accurately known position of the planet on the [[celestial sphere]].<ref name=north08/><ref name=swerdlow98/>

Chinese records about the appearances and motions of Mars appear from before the founding of the [[Zhou Dynasty]] (1045 BCE), and by the [[Chin Dynasty]] (221 BCE) astronomers maintained close records of planetary conjunctions, including those of Mars. In 375 CE, an [[occultation]] of Mars by [[Venus]] was noted. The period and motion of the planet's orbit was known in detail during the [[Tang Dynasty]] (618 CE).<ref name=emp40_2/><ref name=chang_wu_88/><ref name=jha32_4_109/>

The early [[Greek astronomy|astronomy of ancient Greece]] was influenced by knowledge transmitted from the [[Mesopotamia]]n culture. Thus the Babylonians associated Mars with [[Nergal]], their god of war and pestilence, and the Greeks connected the planet with their god of war [[Ares]].<ref name=valery_cumont12/> During this period, the motions of the planets were of little interest to the Greeks, and [[Hesiod]]'s ''[[Works and Days]]'' (c. 650 BCE) makes no mention of the planets.<ref name=evans98/>

==Orbital models==
[[File:Ptolemaicsystem-small.png|right|thumb|Geocentric model of the Universe.|alt=A series of concentric circles surround a fanciful representation of the Earth at center. Latin words and astrological symbols lie around the perimeter.]]
The Greeks used the word ''plan<U+0113>ton'' to refer to the seven celestial bodies that moved with respect to the background stars and they held a [[geocentric]] view that these bodies moved about the [[Earth]]. In his work, ''[[The Republic (Plato)|The Republic]]'' (X.616E<U+2013>617B), the Greek philosopher [[Plato]] provided the oldest known statement defining the order of the planets in Greek astronomical tradition. His list, in order of the nearest to the most distant from the Earth, was as follows: the Moon, Sun, Venus, [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]], Mars, [[Jupiter]], [[Saturn]], and the fixed stars. In his dialogue ''[[Timaeus (dialogue)|Timaeus]]'', Plato proposed that the rotation of these objects across the skies depended on their distance, so that the most distant object moved the slowest.<ref name=brumbaugh87/>

[[Aristotle]], a student of Plato, observed an [[occultation]] of Mars by the Moon in 365 BCE. From this he concluded that Mars must lie further from the Earth than the Moon. He noted that other such occultations of stars and planets had been observed by the Egyptians and Babylonians.<ref name=lloyd96/><ref name=william2000/><ref name=china69BCE>In China, astronomers recorded an occultation of Mars by the Moon in 69 BCE. See Price (2000:148).</ref> Aristotle used this observational evidence to support the Greek sequencing of the planets.<ref name=heidarzadeh08/> His work ''[[On the Heavens|De Caelo]]'' presented a model of the universe in which the Sun, Moon and planets circle about the Earth at a fixed distance. A more sophisticated version of the geocentric model was developed by the Greek astronomer [[Hipparchus]] when he proposed that Mars moved along a circular track called the [[deferent and epicycle|epicycle]] that, in turn, orbited about the Earth along a larger circle called the [[deferent and epicycle|deferent]].<ref name=kolb96/><ref name=hummel1986/>

In [[Roman Egypt]] during the 2nd century CE, [[Claudius Ptolemaeus]] (Ptolemy) attempted to address the problem of the orbital motion of Mars. Observations of Mars had shown that the planet appeared to move 40% faster on one side of its orbit than the other, in conflict with the Aristotelian model of uniform motion. Ptolemy modified the model of planetary motion by adding a [[equant|point offset]] from the center of the planet's circular orbit about which the planet moves at a uniform [[angular velocity|rate of rotation]]. He proposed that the order of the planets, by increasing distance, was: the Moon, Mercury, Venus, Sun, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, and the fixed stars.<ref name=linton2004/> Ptolemy's model and his collective work on astronomy was presented in the multi-volume collection ''[[Almagest]]'', which became the authoritative treatise on Western astronomy for the next fourteen centuries.<ref name=hummel1986/>

In the 5th century CE, the [[Indian astronomy|Indian astronomical]] text ''[[Surya Siddhanta]]'' estimated the [[angular size]] of Mars as 2&nbsp;[[Minute of arc|arc-minutes]] (1/30 of a degree) and its distance to Earth as 10,433,000&nbsp;km (1,296,600&nbsp;[[yojana]], where one yojana is equivalent to eight&nbsp;km in the ''Surya Siddhanta''). From this the diameter of Mars is deduced to be 6,070&nbsp;km (754.4 yojana), which has an error within 11% of the currently accepted value of 6,788&nbsp;km. However, this estimate was based upon an inaccurate guess of the planet's angular size. The result may have been influenced by the work of Ptolemy, who listed a value of 1.57 arc-minutes. Both estimates are significantly larger than the value later obtained by telescope.<ref name=jse11/>

In 1543, [[Nicolaus Copernicus]] published a heliocentric model in his work ''[[De revolutionibus orbium coelestium]]''. This approach placed the Earth in an orbit around the Sun between the circular orbits of Venus and Mars. His model successfully explained why the planets Mars, Jupiter and Saturn were on the opposite side of the sky from the Sun whenever they were in the middle of their retrograde motions. Copernicus was able to sort the planets into their correct heliocentric order based solely on the period of their orbits about the Sun.<ref name=gingerich_maclachlan05/> His theory gradually gained acceptance among European astronomers, particularly after the publication of the ''[[Prutenic Tables]]'' by the German astronomer [[Erasmus Reinhold]] in 1551, which were computed using the Copernican model.<ref name=seop/>

On October 13, 1590, the German astronomer [[Michael Maestlin]] observed the only recorded [[occultation]] of Mars by Venus.<ref name=sat57/> One of his students, [[Johannes Kepler]], quickly became an adherent to the Copernican system. After the completion of his education, Kepler became an assistant to the Danish nobleman and astronomer, [[Tycho Brahe]]. With access granted to Tycho's detailed observations of Mars, Kepler was set to work mathematically assembling a replacement to the Prutenic Tables. After repeatedly failing to fit the motion of Mars into a circular orbit as required under Copernicanism, he succeeded in matching Tycho's observations by assuming the orbit was an [[ellipse]] and the Sun was located at one of the [[Focus (geometry)|foci]]. His model became the basis for [[Kepler's laws of planetary motion]], which were published in his multi-volume work ''Epitome astronomia Copernicanae'' (Epitome of Copernican Astronomy) between 1615 and 1621.<ref name=longair03/>

==Early telescope observations==
At its closest approach, the [[angular size]] of Mars is 25&nbsp;[[arcsecond]]s; this is much too small for the [[Naked eye resolution|naked eye to resolve]]. Hence, prior to the invention of the [[telescope]], nothing was known about the planet besides its position on the sky.<ref name=bone2003/> The Italian scientist [[Galileo Galilei]] was the first person known to use a telescope to make astronomical observations. His records indicate that he began observing Mars through a telescope in September 1610.<ref name=jha15/> This instrument was too primitive to display any surface detail on the planet,<ref name=harland/> so he set the goal of seeing if Mars exhibited [[Planetary phase|phases]] of partial darkness similar to [[Venus]] or the [[Moon]]. Although uncertain of his success, by December he did note that Mars had shrunk in angular size.<ref name=jha15/> Polish astronomer [[Johannes Hevelius]] succeeded in observing a phase of Mars in 1645.<ref name=jbaa94/>

[[File:Mars and Syrtis Major - GPN-2000-000923.jpg|right|thumb|The low albedo feature Syrtis Major is visible at the disk center.

A white patch at the top is an ice cap, and fuzzy white regions at the bottom and the right side of the disk are cloud formations.]]

In 1644, the Italian Jesuit [[Daniello Bartoli]] reported seeing two darker patches on Mars. During the [[Opposition (planets)|oppositions]] of 1651, 1653 and 1655, when the planet made its closest approaches to the Earth, the Italian astronomer [[Giovanni Battista Riccioli]] and his student [[Francesco Maria Grimaldi]] noted patches of differing [[albedo|reflectivity]] on Mars.<ref name=harland/> The first person to draw a map of Mars that displayed terrain features was the Dutch astronomer [[Christiaan Huygens]]. On November 28, 1659 he made an illustration of Mars that showed the distinct dark region now known as [[Syrtis Major Planum]], and possibly one of the polar [[ice cap]]s.<ref name=sheehan_ch2/> The same year, he succeeded in measuring the rotation period of the planet, giving it as approximately 24 hours.<ref name=jbaa94/> He made a rough estimate of the diameter of Mars, guessing that it is about 60% of the size of the Earth, which compares well with the modern value of 53%.<ref name=ferris03/> Perhaps the first definitive mention of Mars's southern polar ice cap was by the Italian astronomer [[Giovanni Domenico Cassini]], in 1666. That same year, he used observations of the surface markings on Mars to determine a rotation period of 24<sup>h</sup> 40<sup>m</sup>. This differs from the correct value by less than three minutes. In 1672, Huygens noticed a fuzzy white cap at the north pole.<ref name=rabkin05/>

After Cassini became the first director of the [[Paris Observatory]] in 1671, he tackled the problem of the physical scale of the Solar System. The relative size of the planetary orbits was known from [[Kepler's third law]], so what was needed was the actual size of one of the planet's orbits. For this purpose, the position of [[Mars]] was measured against the background stars from different points on the Earth, thereby measuring the [[diurnal parallax]] of the planet. During this year, the planet was moving past the point along its orbit where it was nearest to the Sun (a [[Perihelia|perihelic]] opposition), which made this a particularly close approach to the Earth. Cassini and [[Jean Picard]] determined the position of Mars from [[Paris]], while the French astronomer [[Jean Richer]] made measurements from [[Cayenne]], [[South America]]. Although these observations were hampered by the quality of the instruments, the parallax computed by Cassini came within 10% of the correct value.<ref name=hirschfeld01/><ref name=ejp30/> The English astronomer [[John Flamsteed]] made comparable measurement attempts and had similar results.<ref name=taton03/>

In 1704, French-Italian astronomer [[Jacques Philippe Maraldi]] "made a systematic study of the southern cap and observed that it underwent" variations as the planet rotated. This indicated that the cap was not centered on the pole. He observed that the size of the cap varied over time.<ref name=harland/><ref name=iaj3/> The German-English astronomer [[William Herschel]] began making observations of the planet Mars in 1777, particularly of the planet's polar caps. In 1781, he noted that the south cap appeared "extremely large", which he ascribed to that pole being in darkness for the past twelve months. By 1784, the southern cap appeared much smaller, thereby suggesting that the caps vary with the planet's seasons and thus were made of ice. In 1781, he estimated the rotation period of Mars as 24<sup>h</sup> 39<sup>m</sup> 21.67<sup>s</sup> and measured the [[axial tilt]] of the planet's poles to the orbital plane as 28.5<U+00B0>. He noted that Mars had a "considerable but moderate atmosphere, so that its inhabitants probably enjoy a situation in many respects similar to ours".<ref name=iaj3/><ref name=macpherson19/><ref name=pa38/><ref name=markus08/> Between 1796 and 1809, the French astronomer [[Honor<U+00E9> Flaugergues]] noticed obscurations of Mars, suggesting "ochre-colored veils" covered the surface. This may be the earliest report of yellow clouds or storms on Mars.<ref name=blo157_7/><ref name=sheehan_ch3/>

==Geographical period==
At the start of the 19th century, improvements in the size and quality of telescope optics proved a significant advance in observation capability. Most notable among these enhancements was the two-component [[achromatic lens]] of the German optician [[Joseph von Fraunhofer]] that essentially eliminated [[Coma (optics)|coma]]&mdash;an optical effect that can distort the outer edge of the image. By 1812, Fraunhofer had succeeded in creating an achromatic objective lens {{convert|190|mm|in|abbr=on}} in diameter. The size of this primary lens is the main factor in determining the light gathering ability and resolution of a telescope.<ref name=jackson00/><ref name=sheehan_ch4 /> During the opposition of Mars in 1830, the German astronomers [[Johann Heinrich M<U+00E4>dler]] and [[Wilhelm Beer]] used a {{convert|95|mm|in|abbr=on}} Fraunhofer [[refracting telescope]] to launch an extensive study of the planet. They chose a feature located 8<U+00B0> south of the [[equator]] as their point of reference. (This was later named the [[Sinus Meridiani]], and it would become the zero [[Meridian (astronomy)|meridian]] of Mars.) During their observations, they established that most of Mars' surface features were permanent, and more precisely determined the planet's rotation period. In 1840, M<U+00E4>dler combined ten years of observations to draw the first map of Mars. Rather than giving names to the various markings, Beer and M<U+00E4>dler simply designated them with letters; thus Meridian Bay (Sinus Meridiani) was feature "''a''".<ref name=jbaa94/><ref name=sheehan_ch4/><ref name=morton03/>

Working at the [[Vatican Observatory]] during the opposition of Mars in 1858, Italian astronomer [[Pietro Angelo Secchi|Angelo Secchi]] noticed a large blue triangular feature, which he named the "Blue Scorpion". This same seasonal cloud-like formation was seen by English astronomer [[J. Norman Lockyer]] in 1862, and it has been viewed by other observers.<ref name=jalpo34/> During the 1862 opposition, Dutch astronomer [[Frederik Kaiser]] produced drawings of Mars. By comparing his illustrations to those of Huygens and the English natural philosopher [[Robert Hooke]], he was able to further refine the rotation period of Mars. His value of 24<sup>h</sup> 37<sup>m</sup> 22.6<sup>s</sup> is accurate to within a tenth of a second.<ref name=sheehan_ch4 /><ref name=mnras33/>

Father Secchi produced some of the first color illustrations of Mars in 1863. He used the names of famous explorers for the distinct features. In 1869, he observed two dark linear features on the surface that he referred to as ''canali'', which is Italian for 'channels' or 'grooves'.<ref name=bakich00/><ref name=aspl8/><ref name=greeley2007/> In 1867, English astronomer [[Richard A. Proctor]] created a more detailed map of Mars based on the 1864 drawings of English astronomer [[William R. Dawes]]. Proctor named the various [[albedo|lighter or darker]] features after astronomers, past and present, who had contributed to the observations of Mars. During the same decade, comparable maps and nomenclature were produced by the French astronomer [[Camille Flammarion]] and the English astronomer [[Nathan Green]].<ref name=greeley2007/>

At the [[University of Leipzig]] in 1862<U+2013>64, German astronomer [[Johann Karl Friedrich Z<U+00F6>llner|Johann K. F. Z<U+00F6>llner]] developed a custom [[photometer]] to measure the reflectivity of the Moon, planets and bright stars. For Mars, he derived an [[albedo]] of 0.27. Between 1877 and 93, German astronomers [[Gustav M<U+00FC>ller]] and [[Paul Friedrich Ferdinand Kempf|Paul Kempf]] observed Mars using Z<U+00F6>llner's photometer. They found a small [[phase coefficient]]&mdash;the variation in reflectivity with angle&mdash;indicating that the surface of Mars is smooth and without large irregularities.<ref name=pannekoek89/> In 1867, French astronomer [[Pierre Janssen]] and British astronomer [[William Huggins]] used [[spectroscope]]s to examine the atmosphere of Mars. Both compared the [[optical spectrum]] of Mars to that of the [[Moon]]. As the spectrum of the latter did not display [[absorption lines]] of water, they believed they had detected the presence of water vapor in the atmosphere of Mars. This result was confirmed by German astronomer [[Hermann Carl Vogel|Herman C. Vogel]] in 1872 and English astronomer [[Edward W. Maunder]] in 1875, but would later come into question.<ref name=harland05/>

A particularly favorable perihelic opposition occurred in 1877. The English astronomer [[David Gill (astronomer)|David Gill]] used this opportunity to measure the diurnal parallax of Mars from [[Ascension Island]], which led to a parallax estimate of {{nowrap|8.78 <U+00B1> 0.01 [[arcsecond]]s}}.<ref name=shirley1997/> Using this result, he was able to more accurately determine the distance of the Earth from the Sun, based upon the relative size of the orbits of Mars and the Earth.<ref name=massa2/> He noted that the edge of the disk of Mars appeared fuzzy because of its atmosphere, which limited the precision he could obtain for the planet's position.<ref name=webb99/>

In August 1877, the American astronomer [[Asaph Hall]] discovered the two moons of Mars using a {{convert|660|mm|in|abbr=on}} telescope at the [[U.S. Naval Observatory]].<ref name=jha1/> The names of the two satellites, [[Phobos (moon)|Phobos]] and [[Deimos (moon)|Deimos]], were chosen by Hall based upon a suggestion by [[Henry George Madan|Henry Madan]], a science instructor at [[Eton College]] in England.<ref name=jcs02/>

During the 1877 opposition, Italian astronomer [[Giovanni Schiaparelli]] used a {{convert|22|cm|abbr=on}} telescope to help produce the first detailed map of Mars. These maps notably contained features he called ''canali'', which were later shown to be an [[optical illusion]]. These ''canali'' were supposedly long straight lines on the surface of Mars to which he gave names of famous rivers on Earth. His term ''canali'' was popularly mistranslated in English as ''[[Martian canal|canals]]''.<ref name=milone_wilson08/><ref name=sagan80/> In 1886, the English astronomer [[William F. Denning]] observed that these linear features were irregular in nature and showed concentrations and interruptions. By 1895, English astronomer [[Edward Maunder]] became convinced that the linear features were merely the summation of many smaller details.<ref name=pa21/>

In his 1892 work ''La plan<U+00E8>te Mars et ses conditions d'habitabilit<U+00E9>'', Camille Flammarion wrote about how these channels resembled man-made canals, which an intelligent race could use to redistribute water across a dying Martian world. He advocated for the existence of such inhabitants, and suggested they may be more advanced than humans.<ref name=lang03/>

Influenced by the observations of Schiaparelli, [[Percival Lowell]] founded an [[Lowell Observatory|observatory]] with {{convert|30|and|45|cm|in|abbr=on|adj=on}} telescopes. The observatory was used for the exploration of Mars during the last good opportunity in 1894 and the following less favorable oppositions. He published books on Mars and life on the planet, which had a great influence on the public.<ref name=basalla06/> The ''canali'' were found by other astronomers, such as [[Henri Joseph Perrotin]] and [[Louis Thollon]] using a {{convert|38|cm|in|abbr=on}} [[Refracting telescope|refractor]] at the [[Nice Observatory]] in France, one of the largest telescopes of that time.<ref name=isis96/><ref name=ba3/>

Beginning in 1901, American astronomer [[A. E. Douglass]] attempted to photograph the canal features of Mars. These efforts appeared to succeed when American astronomer [[Carl O. Lampland]] published photographs of the supposed canals in 1905.<ref name=pasp33/> Although these results were widely accepted, they became contested by Greek astronomer [[Eug<U+00E8>ne M. Antoniadi]], English naturalist [[Alfred Russel Wallace]] and others as merely imagined features.<ref name=pa21/><ref name=wallace07/> As bigger telescopes were used, fewer long, straight ''canali'' were observed. During an observation in 1909 by Flammarion with a {{convert|84|cm|in|abbr=on}} telescope, irregular patterns were observed, but no ''canali'' were seen.<ref name=nature412/>

==Refining planetary parameters==
[[File:Mars duststorm.jpg|right|thumb|In the left image, thin martian clouds are visible near the polar regions.<ref name=nasa010626/> At right, the surface of Mars is obscured by a [[dust storm]]. ''NASA/HST images''|alt=Two orange-hued disks. The one at left shows distinct darker regions along with cloudy areas near the top and bottom. In the right image, features are obscured by an orange haze. An white ice cap is visible at the bottom of both disks.]]

Surface obscuration caused by yellow clouds had been noted in the 1870s when they were observed by Schiaparelli. Evidence for such clouds was observed during the oppositions of 1892 and 1907. In 1909, Antoniadi noted that the presence of yellow clouds was associated with the obscuration of albedo features. He discovered that Mars appeared more yellow during oppositions when the planet was closest to the Sun and was receiving more energy. He suggested windblown sand or dust as the cause of the clouds.<ref name=jbaa106_4/><ref name=jbas103_5/>

In 1894, American astronomer [[William Wallace Campbell|William W. Campbell]] found that the spectrum of Mars was identical to the spectrum of the Moon, throwing doubt on the burgeoning theory that the atmosphere of Mars is similar to that of the Earth. Previous detections of water in the atmosphere of Mars were explained by unfavorable conditions, and Campbell determined that the water signature came entirely from the Earth's atmosphere. Although he agreed that the ice caps did indicate there was water in the atmosphere, he did not believe the caps were sufficiently large to allow the water vapor to be detected.<ref name=pasp6_37/> At the time, Campbell's results were considered controversial and were criticized by members of the astronomical community, but they were confirmed by American astronomer [[Walter S. Adams]] in 1925.<ref name=qjras18/>

[[Baltic German]] astronomer [[Hermann Struve]] used the observed changes in the orbits of the martian moons to determine the gravitational influence of the planet's [[Oblate spheroid|oblate]] shape. In 1895, he used this data to estimate that the equatorial diameter was 1/190 larger than the polar diameter.<ref name=iaj3/><ref name=an138/> In 1911, he refined the value to 1/192. This result was confirmed by American meteorologist [[Edgar William Woolard|Edgar W. Woolard]] in 1944.<ref name=aj51/>

Using a vacuum [[thermocouple]] attached to the {{convert|2.54|m|in|abbr=on}} Hooker Telescope at [[Mount Wilson Observatory]], in 1924 the American astronomers [[Seth Barnes Nicholson]] and [[Edison Pettit]] were able to measure the thermal energy being radiated by the surface of Mars. They determined that the temperature ranged from {{convert|-68|C|F|abbr=on|0}} at the pole up to {{convert|7|C|F|abbr=on|0}} at the midpoint of the disk (corresponding to the [[equator]]).<ref name=pasp36/> Beginning in the same year, [[radiometric|radiated energy measurements]] of Mars were made by American physicist [[William Coblentz]] and American astronomer [[Carl Otto Lampland]]. The results showed that the night time temperature on Mars dropped to {{convert|-85|C|F|abbr=on|0}}, indicating an "enormous [[wiktionary:diurnal|diurnal]] fluctuation" in temperatures.<ref name=apj63_177/> The temperature of Martian clouds was measured as {{convert|-30|C|F|abbr=on|0}}.<ref name=pasp60/> In 1926, by measuring spectral lines that were [[redshift]]ed by the orbital motions of Mars and Earth, American astronomer [[Walter Sydney Adams]] was able to directly measure the amount of oxygen and water vapor in the atmosphere of Mars. He determined that "extreme desert conditions" were prevalent on Mars.<ref name=apj63_133/> In 1934, Adams and American astronomer [[Theodore Dunham, Jr.]] found that the amount of oxygen in the atmosphere of Mars was less than one percent of the amount over a comparable area on Earth.<ref name=apj79/>

In 1927, Dutch graduate student Cyprianus Annius van den Bosch made a determination of the mass of Mars based upon the motions of the martian moons, with an accuracy of 0.2%. This result was confirmed by the Dutch astronomer [[Willem de Sitter]] in 1938.<ref name=iau21_139/> Using observations of the [[Near-Earth object|near Earth]] [[asteroid]] [[433 Eros|Eros]] from 1926 to 1945, German-American astronomer [[Eugene K. Rabe]] was able to make an independent estimate the mass of Mars, as well as the other planets in the [[inner Solar System]], from the planet's gravitational [[Perturbation (astronomy)|perturbations]] of the asteroid. His estimated margin of error was 0.05%,<ref name=aj55/> but subsequent checks suggested his result was poorly determined compared to other methods.<ref name=aj72_852/>

During the 1920s, French astronomer [[Bernard Lyot]] used a [[polarimeter]] to study the surface properties of the Moon and planets. In 1929, he noted that the [[polarized light]] emitted from the martian surface is very similar to that radiated from the Moon, although he speculated that his observations could be explained by frost and possibly vegetation. Based on the amount of sunlight scattered by the Martian atmosphere, he set an upper limit of 1/15 the thickness of the Earth's atmosphere. This restricted the surface pressure to no greater than {{convert|2.4|kPa|mbar|abbr=on|lk=on|sigfig=2}}.<ref name=aop8_1/> Using [[infrared]] spectrometry, in 1947 the Dutch-American astronomer [[Gerard Kuiper]] detected [[carbon dioxide]] in the Martian atmosphere. He was able to estimate that the amount of carbon dioxide over a given area of the surface is double that on the Earth. However, because he over-estimated the surface pressure on Mars, Kuiper concluded erroneously that the ice caps could not be composed of frozen carbon dioxide.<ref name=horowitz86/> In 1948, American meteorologist [[Seymour L. Hess]] determined that the formation of the thin Martian clouds would only require {{convert|4|mm|in|abbr=on}} of water precipitation and a [[vapor pressure]] of {{convert|0.1|kPa|mbar|abbr=on|sigfig=2}}.<ref name=pasp60/>

The first standard nomenclature for Martian albedo features was introduced by the [[International Astronomical Union]] (IAU) when in 1960 they adopted 128 names from the 1929 map of Antoniadi named ''La Plan<U+00E8>te Mars''. The Working Group for Planetary System Nomenclature (WGPSN) was established by the IAU in 1973 to standardize the naming scheme for Mars and other bodies.<ref name=shirley97/>

The [[International Planetary Patrol Program]] was formed in 1969 as a consortium to continually monitor planetary changes. This worldwide group focused on observing dust storms on Mars. Their images allow martian seasonal patterns to be studied globally, and they showed that most Martian dust storms occur when the planet is closest to the Sun.<ref name=greeley_iversen87/>

Since the 1960s, robotic [[spacecraft]] have been sent to [[Exploration of Mars|explore Mars]] from orbit and the [[Mars landing|surface]] in extensive detail. In addition, remote sensing of Mars from Earth by ground-based and orbiting telescopes has continued across much of the [[electromagnetic spectrum]]. These include [[infrared]] observations to determine the composition of the surface,<ref name=baas20/> [[ultraviolet]] and [[submillimeter]] observation of the atmospheric composition,<ref name=apj538_1/><ref name=apj539_2/> and [[radio]] measurements of wind velocities.<ref name=apj383/>

The [[Hubble Space Telescope]] (HST) has been used to perform systematic studies of Mars<ref name=baas29/> and has taken the highest resolution images of Mars ever captured from Earth.<ref name=hubble010705/> This telescope can produce useful images of the planet when it is at an [[angular distance]] of at least 50<U+00B0> from the Sun. The HST can take images of a [[Sphere|hemisphere]], which yields views of entire weather systems. Earth-based telescopes equipped with [[charge-coupled device]]s can produce useful images of Mars, allowing for regular monitoring of the planet's weather during oppositions.<ref name=baas25/>

[[X-ray]] emission from Mars was first observed by astronomers in 2001 using the [[Chandra X-ray Observatory]], and in 2003 it was shown to have two components. The first component is caused by X-rays from the Sun scattering off the upper Martian atmosphere; the second comes from interactions between [[ion]]s that result in an exchange of charges.<ref name=aaa394/> The emission from the latter source has been observed out to eight times the radius of Mars by the [[XMM-Newton]] orbiting observatory.<ref name=aaa451_2/>

In 1983, the analysis of the [[Shergotty meteorite|Shergottite]], [[Nakhla meteorite|Nakhlite]] and [[Chassigny (meteorite)|Chassigny]] (SNC) group of meteorites showed that they may have [[Mars meteorite|originated on Mars]].<ref name=pass48_12-14/>  The [[Allan Hills 84001]] meteorite, discovered in [[Antarctica]] in 1984, is believed to have originated on Mars but it has an entirely different composition than the SNC group. In 1996, it was announced that this meteorite might contain evidence for microscopic [[fossil]]s of Martian [[bacteria]]. However, this finding remains controversial.<ref name=geca73_21/> Chemical analysis of the Martian meteorites found on Earth suggests that the ambient near-surface temperature of Mars has most likely been below the freezing point of water (0&nbsp;C<U+00B0>) for much of the last four billion years.<ref name=science309_5734/>
