'''State Road 3 (SR&nbsp;3)''' in the [[U.S. State]] of [[Indiana]] is a discontinuous state road running through east central Indiana from near the [[Michigan]] state line to near the [[Ohio River]]. The southernmost terminus is at [[Indiana State Road 62|State Road 62]] in [[Charlestown, Indiana|Charlestown]], and the northernmost terminus is at [[Indiana State Road 120|State Road 120]] near [[Brighton, Indiana|Brighton]].

The route was continuous until 1972, when the route was split into two segments that exist today.

==Route description==

===Charlestown to Greensburg===
SR&nbsp;3 begins just south of Charlestown at SR&nbsp;62 and heads north toward downtown Charlestown.  When in downtown Charlestown SR&nbsp;3 has an [[intersection (road)|intersection]] with [[Indiana State Road 403|State Road 403]] (SR&nbsp;403).  SR&nbsp;3 heads north out of Charlestown.  Then {{convert|17.17|mi|km}} north of SR&nbsp;403 there is a [[wrong-way concurrency]] with [[Indiana State Road 203|State Road 203]] (SR&nbsp;203) for {{convert|1.85|mi|km}}, meaning southbound SR&nbsp;203 and northbound SR&nbsp;3 are going the same direction.  After SR&nbsp;203, SR&nbsp;3 heads north toward [[Vernon, Indiana|Vernon]] and then [[North Vernon, Indiana|North Vernon]].  In North Vernon SR&nbsp;3 has an intersection with [[U.S. Route 50 in Indiana|U.S. Route 50]] (US&nbsp;50).  After North Vernon SR&nbsp;3 heads mainly due north for {{convert|22.52|mi|km}} until [[Indiana State Road 46|State Road 46]] (SR&nbsp;46) just west of [[Greensburg, Indiana|Greensburg]].  SR&nbsp;3 joins SR&nbsp;46 on a four-lane [[divided highway]] and then enters Greensburg from the southwest.  After entering Greensburg SR&nbsp;46 leaves SR&nbsp;3 at Main Street.  In downtown Greensburg SR&nbsp;3 has an intersection with [[U.S. Route 421 in Indiana|U.S. Route 421]] (US&nbsp;421). <ref name="Google Maps # 1">{{Google Maps |url=http://maps.google.com/maps?f=d&source=s_d&saddr=Market+St&daddr=IN-3+S&hl=en&geocode=FeCMSgId6u_k-g%3BFbZmWAIdUGbn-g&mra=prev&sll=39.34067,-85.495605&sspn=0.139134,0.308647&ie=UTF8&ll=39.373322,-85.404625&spn=0.139069,0.308647&z=12|title=overview map of SR 3 from Charlestown to Greensburg |accessdate=2010-12-28}}</ref>

=== Greensburg to Muncie ===
After US&nbsp;421, SR&nbsp;3 leaves Greensburg heading northeast, then just north.  SR&nbsp;3 has an [[Interchange (road)|interchange]] with [[Interstate 74 in Indiana|Interstate 74]] (I-74), {{convert|1.53|mi|km}} from US&nbsp;421.  After I-74, SR&nbsp;3 becomes a two-lane undivided highway.  SR&nbsp;3 has a concurrency with [[U.S. Route 52 in Indiana|U.S. Route 52]] (US&nbsp;52) that lasts for {{convert|0.42|mi|km}} in [[Rushville, Indiana|Rushville]].  SR&nbsp;3 heads due north toward [[U.S. Route 40 in Indiana|U.S. Route 40]] (US&nbsp;40) and then SR&nbsp;3 heads east on US&nbsp;40 for a short concurrency after {{convert|0.07|mi|km}}.  After US&nbsp;40, SR&nbsp;3 has an interchange with [[Interstate 70 in Indiana|interstate 70]] (I-70), exit number 123 on I-70.  Just south of I-70 SR&nbsp;3 becomes a four-lane divided highway.  After I-70, SR&nbsp;3 passes near [[New Castle, Indiana|New Castle]].  SR&nbsp;3 and [[U.S. Route 36 in Indiana|U.S. Route 36]] (US&nbsp;36) have an interchange near [[Mount Summit, Indiana|Mount Summit]]. After US&nbsp;36, SR&nbsp;3 head north toward [[Muncie, Indiana|Muncie]], where SR&nbsp;3 has an interchange with [[Indiana State Road 67|State Road 67]] (SR&nbsp;67). <ref name="Yahoo Maps #1">{{yahoo maps|url=http://maps.yahoo.com/#mvt=m&lat=40.171579&lon=-85.378114&zoom=12&q1=39.348819%2C-85.498964&q2=40.148489%2C-85.366957|title=overview map of SR 3 from Greensburg to Muncie |accessdate=2010-12-27}}</ref>
=== Muncie Bypass ===

At the interchange with SR&nbsp;67, SR&nbsp;3 heads east, then north along the bypass.  Interchange includes [[U.S. Route 35 in Indiana|U.S. Route 35]] (US&nbsp;35) south, [[Indiana State Road 32|State Road 32]] (SR&nbsp;32), and SR&nbsp;67 north.  The bypass is a [[limited-access]] highway. <ref name="Yahoo Maps #2">{{yahoo maps|url=http://maps.yahoo.com/#mvt=m&lat=40.19112&lon=-85.327989&zoom=15&q1=40.148489%2C-85.366957&q2=40.249252%2C-85.367643|title=overview map of SR 3 Muncie Bypass |accessdate=2010-12-27}}</ref>

=== Muncie to Markle ===
[[Image:Markle Indiana.jpg|thumb|left|200px|View of the north end of the southern section of State Road 3 at Markle]]
North of the Muncie Bypass, US&nbsp;35 leaves SR&nbsp;3 due west to [[Kokomo, Indiana|Kokomo]].  After US&nbsp;35, SR&nbsp;3 heads due north to [[Markle, Indiana|Markle]].  Passing though [[Hartford City, Indiana|Hartford City]], where SR&nbsp; meets [[Indiana State Road 26|State Road 26]] (SR&nbsp;26).  South of Markle SR&nbsp;3 turns northeast, then SR&nbsp;3 meets [[Indiana State Road 116|State Road 116]] (SR&nbsp;116).  Then {{convert|0.46|mi|km}} after SR&nbsp;116, SR&nbsp;3 comes to its northern terminus of the southern section of SR&nbsp;3, at [[U.S. Route 224 in Indiana|U.S. Route 224]] (US&nbsp;224). <ref name="Google Maps # 2">{{Google Maps |url=http://maps.google.com/maps?f=d&source=s_d&saddr=IN-3+N%2FUS-35+N%2FN+Co+Rd+100+E&daddr=N+Clark+St&hl=en&geocode=FUMiZgIdA2bp-g%3BFe0AbwId-eHp-g&mra=mift&mrsp=1&sz=16&sll=40.829252,-85.331047&sspn=0.007469,0.02105&ie=UTF8&ll=40.824787,-85.313129&spn=0.029877,0.0842&z=14|title=overview map of SR 3 from Muncie to Markle |accessdate=2010-12-30}}</ref>

=== Fort Wayne to Brighton ===

The southern terminus of the northern section of SR&nbsp;3 begins at [[Interstate 69 in Indiana|Interstate 69]] (I-69) and the northern terminus of [[U.S. Route 27 in Indiana|U.S. Route 27]] (US&nbsp;27).  SR&nbsp;3 heads north from this point, bypassing [[Huntertown, Indiana|Huntertowm]], {{convert|8.20|mi|km}} north of I-69.  Then SR&nbsp;3 enters [[Dekalb County, Indiana|Dekalb County]] and meeting [[Indiana State Road 205|State Road 205]] (SR&nbsp;205).  Very soon after SR&nbsp;205, SR&nbsp;3 enters [[Noble County, Indiana|Noble County]], bypassing [[LaOtto, Indiana|LaOtto]], [[Avilla, Indiana|Avilla]], and [[Kendallville, Indiana|Kendallville]].  In Kendallville SR&nbsp;3 has a short concurrency with [[U.S. Route 6 in Indiana|U.S. Route 6]] (US&nbsp;6).  After the US&nbsp;6 concurrency SR&nbsp;3 head due north, until [[Mongo, Indiana|Mongo]] where SR&nbsp;3 turns northwest.  Then in [[Brighton, Indiana|Brighton]] SR&nbsp;3 northern terminus at [[Indiana State Road 120|State Road 120]] (SR&nbsp;120). <ref name="Google Maps # 3">{{Google Maps |url=http://maps.google.com/maps?f=d&source=s_d&saddr=Lima+Rd&daddr=IN-3+N&hl=en&geocode=FcaZcwIdMJTs-g%3BFYagfAIdjkHq-g&mra=mift&mrsp=1&sz=13&sll=41.719952,-85.272102&sspn=0.058939,0.1684&ie=UTF8&ll=41.093325,-85.02903&spn=0.119021,0.3368&z=12|title=overview map of SR 3 from Fort Wayne to Brighton |accessdate=2010-12-30}}</ref>

==== Lane configurations ====

* Between I-69 to {{convert|0.1|mi|km}} north of Ludwig Road in Fort Wayne (3 lanes on each side)
* Between just north of Ludwig Road to Wallen Road in Fort Wayne (2 lanes on each side), until end of construction set for 2011, then 3 lanes on each side
* Between Wallen Road in Fort Wayne and just north Dupont Road in Fort Wayne (3 lanes on each side)
* Between just north of Dupont Road in Fort Wayne to US&nbsp;6 in Kendallville (2 lanes on each side - a third lane northbound from Carroll Road in Fort Wayne to {{convert|0.25|mi|km}} north of Carroll Road)
* Between west junction of US&nbsp;6 to the east junction of US&nbsp;6 (2 lanes each direction and a common center turn lane)
* Between US&nbsp;6 to SR&nbsp;120 (1 lane each direction)

== History ==
Until 1972, SR 3 went through Fort Wayne. But with the completion of I-69, the section that went through Fort Wayne was turned back.<ref name="illi-indi" />

Until 1980, Indiana 3 was concurrent with Indiana 62 until it reached [[Interstate 65]] in [[Jeffersonville, Indiana|Jeffersonville]]. <ref>[http://highwayexplorer.com/showScannedMap.php?id=121 Indiana Highway Ends Map of SR 3 in Jeffersonville]</ref>

In 1990, the four-lane upgrade from the DeKalb/Allen County line north of Huntertown to Kendallville was completed, bypassing the towns of [[LaOtto, Indiana|LaOtto]] and [[Avilla, Indiana|Avilla]]. This made Indiana 3 four lanes for the {{convert|25|mi|km}} from [[I-69]] in [[Fort Wayne, Indiana|Fort Wayne]] to [[US 6]] in [[Kendallville, Indiana|Kendallville]].<ref>{{cite news|title=U.S. 6, Ind. 3: Kendallville's routes to growth|url=http://www.kpcnews.net/special-sections/reflections1/reflections9.html|publisher=The News-Sun|accessdate=2007-04-27}}</ref>

Currently, there are preparations in progress for widening about {{convert|3|mi|km}} from s/o Ludwig Road in [[Fort Wayne, Indiana|Fort Wayne]] to n/o Dupont Road in Allen County. This section of highway will be widened to six lanes and it is slated for completion in 2011. There is also speculation of possibly widening Indiana 3 in the future even farther North from Dupont Road to Gump Road in the Huntertown area followed by a section extending from Gump Road to the Allen County Line. The above speculated projects are NOT currently in any planning or funding process, although they are mentioned in the Allen County 2030 Transportation Plan and listed as illustrative projects.

== Miscellanea ==
[[Indiana State Road 103|State Road 103]], a branch of SR 3, never intersects with this route (the parent), although that route was the original routing of SR 3.<ref>[http://highwayexplorer.com/EndsPage.php?id=1103&section=1 Indiana Highway Ends - SR 103]</ref>
