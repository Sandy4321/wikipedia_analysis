The '''Ron Paul presidential campaign of 1988''' began in early 1987 when former [[United States Congress|Congressman]] [[Ron Paul]] of [[Texas]] announced his candidacy for the [[United States presidential election, 1988|1988]] presidential nomination of the [[Libertarian Party (United States)|Libertarian Party]]. He joined the [[Third party (United States)|third party]] after leaving the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] over the [[Reagan administration]]'s handling of the [[United States federal budget|federal budget]]. He ran on a platform that included non-interventionism in foreign conflicts, [[decriminalization]] of illegal drugs, a return to the [[gold standard]], the abolition of the [[Federal Reserve]] and a reduction in all government spending.

Paul defeated [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] activist [[Russell Means]] at the Libertarian Party's National Convention in [[Seattle]] to win the party's presidential nomination. Former Alaska State Congressman  [[Andre Marrou]] was selected as his [[running mate]]. After over a year of campaigning as the Libertarian Party nominee, Paul received very little media coverage, and was excluded from [[United States presidential debates|Presidential debates]]. On Election Day, he was on the ballot in 46 states and the District of Columbia, and finished in third place with approximately 0.47% of the vote, behind Democratic candidate [[Michael Dukakis]] and the winner [[Vice President of the United States|Vice President]] [[George H.W. Bush]].

==Background==
Paul was elected to [[Texas's 22nd congressional district]] as a Republican during a [[special election]] early in 1976, and he supported [[Ronald Reagan]]'s presidential bid that year.<ref name="underdog"/> Paul lost his bid for re-election in late 1976, but was elected back to the seat in 1978. During his time in office, Paul followed the political and economic princles of [[laissez-faire]] advocate [[Ludwig von Mises]], and gained a reputation as Dr. No, voting against legislation he felt was unconstitutional.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.usnews.com/usnews/news/articles/070323/23paulfacts.htm|title=10 Things You Didn't Know About Ron Paul|last=Burton|first=Danielle |date=March 23, 2007|work=usnews.com|publisher=U.S.News & World Report, L.P|accessdate=7 May 2010}}</ref> He also advanced legislation establishing [[term limit]]s for Congressmen, and opposed any implementation of a [[military draft]].<ref name="wall street">{{cite web|url=http://www.seedship.com/politics/ronpaul1.html|title=The Libertarian Congressman Is Back|last=Fund |first=John H. |date=January 13, 1997|work=Wall Street Journal|publisher=Dow Jones & Company, Inc.|accessdate=7 May 2010}}</ref>   
After serving four terms in the U.S. House of Representatives, Paul vied for the 1984 Republican Party Senatorial nomination in Texas, and gained a reputation as an adept fundraiser. He was defeated in the primary and returned to his practice of [[obstetrics]] and [[gynecology]]<ref name="houston" />

In January 1987, Paul officially left the Republican Party <ref name="ledger" /> to run for the Libertarian Party nomination after becoming disillusioned by the spending policies of the Reagan administration<ref name="fact">{{cite web|url=http://www.factcheck.org/elections-2008/wrong_paul.html|title=Wrong Paul|date=February 11, 2008|work=FactCheck.org|publisher=Annenberg Public Policy Center of the University of Pennsylvania|accessdate=19 May 2010}}</ref> and presumptive Republican Presidential nominee George H.W.

==Campaign developments==
===Libertarian Party nomination campaign===
[[File:Ron paul.jpg|thumb|Congressman Ron Paul]]
Ron Paul announced his candidacy for the Libertarian Party's presidential nomination on February 16, 1987 during a party luncheon in [[San Francisco, California]]. During his announcement speech, Paul commented that "Big government is running away with our freedom and our money, and the Republicans are just as much to blame as the Democrats." He later proclaimed himself as "a choice for freedom."<ref name="houston">{{citation |url=http://www.chron.com/CDA/archives/archive.mpl?id=1987_442777 |title=Ron Paul seeks to be Libertarian Party presidential nominee |first=John |last=Toth |newspaper=Houston Chronicle |publication-place=Houston, Texas |page=11 |date=February 17, 1987 }}</ref> According to Paul, Libertarian Party leaders notified him that there would be little opposition to his run<ref name="houston" /> at the party's September 1987 National convention.<ref>{{citation |url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=St4PAAAAIBAJ&sjid=cI8DAAAAIBAJ&pg=4017,5380048&dq=ron-paul |title=Water thicker than oil? |first=Jack |last=Anderson |last2=Van Atta |newspaper=Ellensburg Daily Record |publication-place=Ellensburg, Washington |date=June 15, 1987 |page=4 |first2=Dale }}</ref>

Paul campaigned for the nomination for the most part of 1987, traveling to numerous state conventions.<ref name="ledger" /> He visited [[Pennsylvania]] in April to discuss the Libertarian Party's platform with students from [[Penn State]]. Native American activist, and challenger to Paul, Russell Means of [[South Dakota]] also appeared at the event.<ref> {{citation|url=http://digitalnewspapers.libraries.psu.edu/Default/Skins/BasicArch/Client.asp?Skin=BasicArch&&AppName=2&enter=true&BaseHref=DCG/1987/04/02&EntityId=Ar02001 |title=Libertarian hopefuls visit Penn State |first=Brad |last=Gibson |newspaper=The Daily Collegian |publication-place=University Park, Pennsylvania |page=20 |date=April 2, 1987 }}</ref> Means had officially announced his Libertarian presidential nomination candidacy a day before Paul.<ref name="ledger">{{cite news |url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=C88SAAAAIBAJ&sjid=u_sDAAAAIBAJ&pg=4237,5032504&dq=ron-paul |title=Also running |newspaper=The Ledger |publication-place=Lakeland, Florida |date=May 10, 1987 |page=10 }}</ref> While Means received heightened media attention for his comments regarding Native Americans and militancy, reports in the news media circulated that highlighted Paul's calls for the nation to return to the Gold Standard,<ref>{{citation |url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=U94PAAAAIBAJ&sjid=cI8DAAAAIBAJ&pg=6278,6151099&dq=ron-paul |title=Ministers dispute Jesse Jackson's start|first=Jack |last=Anderson |last2=Spear |newspaper=Ellensburg Daily Record |publication-place=Ellensburg, Washington |date=June 25, 1987 |page=4 |first2=Joseph }}</ref> and diminish the power of the Federal Reserve. Paul and Means were described as members of the right and left wing of the Libertarian Party, respectively.<ref name="stars" />

By June, Paul was appearing at speaking events with Libertarian Vice Presidential candidate Andre Marrou.<ref>{{citation |url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=OR8SAAAAIBAJ&sjid=cu8DAAAAIBAJ&pg=3607,6689164&dq=ron-paul |title=Indian activist asks Libertarians for nomination |newspaper=The Spokesman-Review |publication-place=Spokane, Washington |date=June 27, 1987 |page=6 }}</ref> Marrou had previously served as a Libertarian member of the [[Alaska House of Representatives]].<ref name="marrou"/> The pair campaigned side-by-side in [[Idaho]] where Paul remarked "that a Libertarian can win the [[White House]] in the not-too-distant future." After that, Paul traveled west to address Libertarian Party officials in [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington]] and [[Oregon]]. By the end of the month, Paul had raised $200,000 for his campaign.<ref name="stars"> {{citation |url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=Ox8SAAAAIBAJ&sjid=cu8DAAAAIBAJ&pg=6409,8648285&dq=ron-paul |title=Texan sees a Libertarian president in political stars |newspaper=The Spokesman-Review |publication-place=Spokane, Washington |date=June 29, 1987 |page=8 }}</ref> As the convention approached, Paul was one of seven candidates vying for the party's nomination. However, he and Means were the only candidates mentioned in the press. Speculation that Marrou could be chosen as a compromise candidate also surrounded the event, at which 800 attendees were expected.<ref name="seattle"> {{citation |url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=A_URAAAAIBAJ&sjid=_e8DAAAAIBAJ&pg=5839,8157647&dq=ron-paul |title=Hot contest among Libertarians expected to draw heavy turnout |newspaper=The Spokesman-Review |publication-place=Spokane, Washington |date=August 29, 1987 |page=7 }}</ref>

===Libertarian National Convention===
The Libertarian National Convention, formally called the Culture of Freedom Conference and Presidential Nominating Convention, was held from September 2&ndash;6 at the [[Sheraton Hotel]] in Seattle, Washington.<ref name="seattle"/> A forum featuring the four leading candidates was held prior to the nomination. During an exchange, Paul apologized for his past membership in the Republican Party. Means tried to portray himself as a better candidate than Paul, dismissing the funds raised by Paul's campaign and commenting that Means was receiving "10 times more press" than the former Congressman and was therefore "100 times more effective." Another candidate expressed his desire to "put handcuffs on all [[IRS]] agents."<ref>{{citation |url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=d1cPAAAAIBAJ&sjid=p4YDAAAAIBAJ&pg=5224,1878387&dq=ron-paul |title=Libertarian delegates hear party candidates debate |newspaper=The Bulletin |publication-place=Bend, Oregon |date=September 4, 1987 |page=3 }}</ref>

Paul was nominated on the first ballot with 196 of the 368 votes cast, with his closest opponent, Means, receiving 120 votes.<ref name="pick"/> He accepted the nomination and thanked the delegates with his wife, Carol, by his side.<ref>{{cite news|title=Disputatious Delegates|last=Slater|first=Wayne|date=September 7, 1987|work=Dallas Morning News|publisher=The Dallas Morning News Co|accessdate=20 May 2010}}</ref> Marrou was selected as his running mate as the candidate for Vice President without any opposition. The platform for the party was also decided, and included the removal of all [[nuclear weapons]] from Europe, termination of the 1972 [[Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty]], withdrawal of all American troops abroad, prosecution of anyone who knowingly spreads [[AIDS]] and the legalization of [[hypodermic syringe]] possession. A plank revealed a [[pro-choice]] stand on abortion, which was at odds with Paul's [[pro-life]] position.<ref name="pick"> {{citation |url=http://www.nytimes.com/1987/09/06/us/libertarians-pick-ex-congressman-in-88-bid.html |title=Libertarians Pick Ex-Congressman in '88 Bid |first=Wallace |last=Turner |newspaper=New York Times |publication-place=New York, New York |date=September 6, 1987 |page=35 }}</ref>

==General election campaign==
Paul returned to the campaign trail and entered the General election stretch of the campaign a year ahead of the nominees for the two major parties. He traveled to Universities<ref> {{citation |url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=k5MUAAAAIBAJ&sjid=GoQDAAAAIBAJ&pg=4960,145547&dq=ron-paul |title=Libertarian candidate to speak at the U |newspaper=The Deseret News |publication-place=Salt Lake City, Utah |date=November 1, 1987 |page=8 }}</ref><ref name="underdog"/> held press conferences<ref name="helena"/> and filmed an eight minute television advertisement, to be shown in small states and on cable television,<ref name="texas"/> to help spread his message.<ref name="helena">{{citation |url= |title=Libertarian candidate calls for drastic steps |newspaper=The Spokesman-Review |publication-place=Spokane, Washington |date=November 8, 1987 |page=5 |format=}}</ref> He focused on gaining enough support to win a place in the [[League of Women Voters]]-sponsored presidential debates.<ref name="pick" />

===Spreading the message===
Paul held one of his numerous press conferences in [[Helena, Montana]], where he pushed for the [[Reagan administration]] to balance the budget and cut spending and taxes. He argued that Reagan had reneged on [[Ronald Reagan presidential campaign, 1980|his 1980 campaign]] promise to balance the budget, resulting in voter dissatisfaction. Paul stated that [[United States Secretary of Treasury|Treasury Secretary]] [[James Baker]] should be [[Impeachment|removed from his office]] for the administration's monetary policy.<ref name="helena"/>

}}
Paul was featured in the November 1987 issue of ''[[Texas Monthly]]''. The article compared the campaign to that of former U.S. Senator [[Eugene McCarthy]], and made note of Paul's opposition to the [[CIA]]'s assistance of the [[Contras]] in [[Nicaragua]]. Journalist Tom Curtis described Paul's supporters as "a ragtag coalition of antiabortion activists, tax rebels, anti-war types, gold bugs and other anti-establishment, single issue voters."<ref name="texas"/> Curtis noted that Paul's monthly newsletter, ''The Ron Paul Investment Letter'' had 12,000 subscribers who paid an annual fee of $99.<ref name="texas"/> 

Paul traveled to [[Rome, Georgia]] and appeared at the downtown [[Holiday Inn]] in November 1987. During the appearance, he railed against the policies of [[Washington D.C.]], commenting that there was no difference between the two major parties, and that both supported "intervention oversees,&nbsp;... in our personal lives&nbsp;... [and] in the marketplace." Paul went on to compare his Libertarian ideology to the mindset of the [[founding fathers]].<ref>{{citation |url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=CdUHAAAAIBAJ&sjid=PTYDAAAAIBAJ&pg=5106,3401071&dq=ron-paul |title=Libertarian candidate extols party's options |first=Paul |last=Meuller |newspaper=Rome News-Tribune |publication-place=Rome, Georgia |date=November 12, 1987 |page=3 }}</ref> The next month, Vice Presidential nominee Andre Marrou traveled to Texas and discussed the Paul campaign's prospects. He opined that the ticket could possibly win 2 to 12 million votes in the following year's election, and that Paul might win if [[Jesse Jackson]] and [[Pat Robertson]] were selected as the Democratic and Republican presidential nominees, respectively. He explained that America did not want a preacher as president. Since the chance that either of those candidates would be named as their party's representative seemed unlikely, by this point in the election one of the campaign's priorities was securing a place on the ballot, which they had done in 20 of the 50 states.<ref>{{citation |url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=9VMQAAAAIBAJ&sjid=tYsDAAAAIBAJ&pg=3428,74203&dq=ron-paul |title=Libertarians say party could make difference|newspaper=The Free-Lance Star|publication-place=Fredericksburg, Virginia |date=December 1, 1987 |page=16 }}</ref>

==="Kamikaze" campaign===
Paul arrived in North Florida for a campaign event in early January 1988, with ten months still remaining until the election. The event was chronicled by a journalist for the ''[[Ocala Star-Banner]]'', who compared Paul to a [[kamikaze]] and remarked that he never gives up even though his "chance of becoming president" was no greater than that for the journalist himself. Paul was described as "slim, attractive, graying, immaculately attired and most articulate," but as a candidate who was dismissed by the media for his political positions such as support of the decriminalization of hard drugs.<ref>{{citation |url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=RtcTAAAAIBAJ&sjid=cwYEAAAAIBAJ&pg=4373,7195384&dq=ron-paul |first=Buddy |last=Davis |title=Ron Paul: Political kamikaze with a cause |newspaper=Ocala Star-Banner |publication-place=Ocala, Florida |page=9 |date=January 15, 1988}}</ref> Paul visited the [[University of Florida]] during his trip, and gave a campaign speech in front of 200 students. Later in the month, he left Florida and campaigned in Iowa, where he spoke at [[Drake University]] and the [[University of Iowa]].<ref name="students">{{citation |url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=5NISAAAAIBAJ&sjid=8_sDAAAAIBAJ&pg=4883,1551833&dq=ron-paul |title=Ron Paul 'the only game in town' |newspaper=The Ledger |publication-place=Lakeland, Florida |page=14 |date=February 20, 1988}}</ref> In February, he received the endorsement of Former Congresman [[Pete McCloskey]] (R-CA).<ref name="students" />

Paul had received little media attention during the early stages of the Democratic and Republican primary contests. But as [[Vice President of the United States|Vice President]] [[George H.W. Bush]] and [[Governor of Massachusetts|Massachusetts Governor]] [[Michael Dukakis]] secured their respective parties' nominations, mentions of Paul increased. It was noted that if Bush became unacceptable to [[conservatism in the United States|conservatives]], they would not turn to Dukakis, but would most likely vote for Paul as a protest.<ref>{{citation |url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=vlUNAAAAIBAJ&sjid=320DAAAAIBAJ&pg=6974,13421&dq=ron-paul |first=Harry |last=Stoffer |title=Bush, Dukakis face same dilemma |newspaper=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette |publication-place=Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania |page=3 |date=May 2, 1988}}</ref> During this time, publications also started discussed Paul's tax policy. It called for a flat income tax rate of 10% on all earning over $10,000 annually.<ref>{{citation |url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=QrULAAAAIBAJ&sjid=T1YDAAAAIBAJ&pg=6638,4730716&dq=ron-paul |last=Sobran |first=Joseph |title=Place a Lid on Federal Taxes |newspaper=The Victoria Advocate |publication-place=Victoria, Texas |date=May 15, 1988 |page=4A }}</ref> Paul sold his tax plan while campaigning in [[Utah]]. In front of 250 people in [[Kane County, Utah|Kane County]], he hailed [[California]]'s 1978 passage of [[Proposition 13]] as starting the "tax revolt and [sending] a message across the country. The next big message for this country should be the overwhelming passage of the tax initiatives&nbsp;... in November."<ref>{{citation |url= http://archive.deseretnews.com/archive/7855/LIBERTARIAN-CANDIDATE-PUTS-STRESS-ON-TAX-LIMIT.html |first=Carrie |last=Moore |title=Libertarian  Candidate Puts Stress on Tax Limit |newspaper=Deseret News |publication-place=Salt Lake City, Utah |date=June 19, 1988 }}</ref> Paul was also part of [[C-SPAN]]'s program ''[[Road to the White House]]'', which followed different candidates on the campaign trail. In June, they aired Paul's address to the [[National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws]].<ref>{{citation |url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=0t0SAAAAIBAJ&sjid=i_wDAAAAIBAJ&pg=2847,2132186&dq=ron-paul |title=Sunday |newspaper=The Ledger |publication-place=Lakeland, Florida |date=June 18, 1988 |page=30 }}</ref>

During a July press conference in [[Spokane, Washington]], while lobbying for [[ballot access]], Paul promised that as president he would [[veto]] spending increases for both domestic programs and the military. He asked in reference to the portrayal of his party's plank, "what's extreme about a balanced budget?" Paul conceded that he would not win the election but explained that votes for his ticket would give a bigger voice to Libertarian issues in American politics, and that he would only be disappointed if he did not receive at least 5% of the vote in the state.<ref>{{citation |url= http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=yR0SAAAAIBAJ&sjid=-u8DAAAAIBAJ&pg=7104,7304155&dq=ron-paul |first=Jim |last=Camden |title=Libertarian is happy to be on ballot |newspaper=The Spokesman-Review |publication-place=Spokane, Washington |page=B2 |date=July 27, 1988}}</ref> A few weeks later, ''[[The New York Times]]'' discovered that many former members of the Pat Robertson campaign were helping Ron Paul's candidacy. They found that the campaign workers were disseminating literature in [[Michigan]] that criticized Bush, and stated that Paul would "carry the standard" of the [[free market]]. Paul commented in a ''[[San Diego Union]]'' interview that he "identif[ied]with Robertson" although "he's not a libertarian." Paul spent the beginning of August, campaigning in his home state of Texas.<ref>{{citation |url=http://www.nytimes.com/1988/08/10/us/some-republicans-back-foe-of-bush.html |first=Wayne |last=King |title=Some Republicans Back Foe of Bush |newspaper=The New York Times |publication-place=New York, New York |date=August 10, 1988 }}</ref>
