'''Barbara Castle, Baroness Castle of Blackburn'''  [[Privy Council of the United Kingdom|PC]] ([[October 6]], [[1910]] &ndash; [[May 3]], [[2002]]) was a British left-wing politician, born '''Barbara Anne Betts''' in [[Chesterfield]], [[Derbyshire]] (and brought up in [[Pontefract]] and [[Bradford]], [[Yorkshire]]), who adopted her family's politics, joining the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]].

After an education at [[St. Hugh's College, Oxford]], she was elected to [[Metropolitan Borough of St Pancras|St. Pancras Borough Council]] in [[1937]], and in [[1943]] she spoke at the annual Labour Party Conference for the first time. She was a senior administrative officer at the [[Ministry of Food]] and an [[Air Raid Precautions|ARP]] warden during [[the Blitz]].

Following her marriage to [[Ted Castle]] in [[1944]], Barbara became a [[journalist]] on the ''[[Daily Mirror]]'', which by this time had become strongly pro-Labour.
In the [[1945]] general election, which Labour won in a landslide, she became [[Member of Parliament|MP]] for [[Blackburn]], [[Lancashire]]. The fiery redhead soon achieved a reputation as a left-winger and a rousing speaker. During the 1950s she was a high-profile [[Bevanism|Bevanite]] and made a name for herself as a vocal advocate of [[decolonisation]] and the [[Anti-Apartheid Movement]]. In the [[Harold Wilson|Wilson]] government of [[1964]]&ndash;[[1970]], she held a succession of ministerial posts. She entered the Cabinet as the first [[Secretary of State for International Development|Minister for International Development]]. As [[Secretary of State for Transport|Minister of Transport]] ([[December 23]], [[1965]]&ndash;[[April 6]], [[1968]]), she introduced the [[breathalyser]] to combat drink-driving, and presided over the closure of approximately 2050 miles of railways as she enacted her part of the [[Beeching axe|Beeching cuts]]. As [[First Secretary of State]] and [[Secretary of State for Employment]], she was never far from controversy which reached a fever pitch when the [[trade union]]s rebelled against her proposals to reduce their powers in her [[1969]] [[white paper]], '[[In Place of Strife]]'.

In [[1974]], after [[Harold Wilson]]'s defeat of [[Edward Heath]], Castle became [[Secretary of State]] for Social Services, but lost her place as a minister after clashing with the new [[prime minister]], [[James Callaghan]], who took over from Wilson in [[1976]]. Despite having taken an [[Euroscepticism|Eurosceptic]] stance in the [[United Kingdom referendum, 1975|1975 referendum debate]], she later became a [[Member of the European Parliament]] ([[1979]]&ndash;[[1989]]). In an interview many years later, discussing her removal from office by James Callaghan, she claimed that the Prime Minister had told her he wanted "somebody younger" in the Cabinet, to which she famously remarked that perhaps the most restrained thing she had ever achieved in her life was to not reply with "then why not start with yourself, Jim?"

''[[The Castle Diaries]]'' were published after the [[United Kingdom general election, 1979|1979 General Election]], and chronicled her time in office from 1964-1976 and provide an insight into the workings of Cabinet Government. A review in the ''[[London Review of Books]]'' at the time of their publication claimed, "Barbara Castle's diary shows more about the nature of Cabinet Government than any previous publication...it is, I think, better than Crossman", a reference to the published diaries of former Cabinet Minister [[Richard Crossman]]. However, when [[Enoch Powell]] reviewed her diaries he remarked that the "overpowering impression left on the reader's mind by her diary is that of triviality: the largest decisions and the profoundest issues are effortlessly trivialised".<ref>"The shallow diaries of a cabinet lady", ''Now!'', September 26, 1980.</ref>

In [[1990]], she was made a [[life peer]] in her own right, as '''Baroness Castle of Blackburn''', of Ibstone in the County of [[Buckinghamshire]] (having previously enjoyed the courtesy title of '[[Lady]]' as a result of her husband's life [[peerage]], but having refused to use it). She remained active in politics right up until her death, attacking [[Chancellor of the Exchequer|Chancellor]] [[Gordon Brown]]'s refusal to link pensions to earnings at the Labour party conference in [[2001]].

Barbara Castle's autobiography, ''Fighting All The Way'' (ISBN 0-330-32886-7), was published in [[1993]].
