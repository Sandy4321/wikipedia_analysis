'''''Tosa''''' was a planned [[battleship]] of the [[Imperial Japanese Navy]]. Designed by [[Yuzuru Hiraga]], she was envisioned as the [[lead ship]] of the [[Tosa class battleship|''Tosa'' class]] of two {{convert|39900|LT|t|0|lk=on|abbr=on|adj=on}} ships. The battleships would have been armed with ten {{convert|410|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} guns and bring Japan closer to its goal of an "Eight-four" fleet (eight battleships and four [[battlecruiser]]s). However, after the [[Washington Naval Conference]] and the signing of the [[Washington Naval Treaty]], all work on the ship was halted. With the vessel required to be destroyed in accordance with the terms of the treaty, the incomplete ''Tosa'' was then subjected to various tests to gauge the effect of Japanese weaponry before being [[scuttled]] on 9 February 1925.

==Design and construction==
:''For additional details and design information, see [[Tosa class battleship|''Tosa'' class battleship]]''
Designed by [[Yuzuru Hiraga]], ''Tosa'' was intended to be part of a Japanese "Eight-four fleet", comprising eight battleships and four battlecruisers, the successor to the proposed "[[Eight-eight fleet]]".  ''Tosa'' and her sister ship ''[[Japanese aircraft carrier Kaga|Kaga]]'' were intended to be the second set of high-speed battleships (after the [[Nagato class battleship|''Nagato'' class]]) under the plan, and were approved for construction in the [[Diet of Japan|Diet's]] 14 July 1917 warship-building authorization.  Engineering blueprints for the two ships were completed by Japanese naval engineers in 1919.  Based on Japanese studies of the British experience at the [[Battle of Jutland]], the ships were to include new features over previous designs, including higher steaming speed despite increased tonnage, flush decks, and inclined armor.<ref>Watts, ''The Imperial Japanese Navy'', 62</ref><ref>Evans and Peattie, ''Kaigun'', 171</ref><ref name="Lacroix14">Lacroix, ''Japanese Cruisers'', 14</ref>{{#tag:ref|The 1917 authorization provided for the construction of, in addition to ''Tosa'' and ''Kaga'', the battleship ''[[Japanese battleship Mutsu|Mutsu]]'', battlecruisers ''[[Japanese battlecruiser Amagi|Amagi]]'' and ''[[Japanese aircraft carrier Akagi|Akagi]]'', nine cruisers, 27 destroyers, 18 submarines and three auxiliaries.  All construction on the ships authorized by the 1917 mandate were to be completed by 1 April 1924.<ref name="Lacroix14"/>|group=N}}

''Kaga''{{'}}s hull was quickly reordered as an aircraft carrier to compensate for the loss.<ref>Friedman, "Japan", 232, 235</ref>|group=N}}

==Career==
In August 1922, ''Tosa'' was moved to [[Kure, Hiroshima|Kure]], still incomplete.<ref name="Breyer350"/> Fifty thousand people turned out to watch as the battleship was towed out of the harbor by five tugboats.<ref name="Yoshimura11">Yoshimura, ''Battleship Musashi'', 11</ref> The [[barbette]]s for the 406&nbsp;mm (16&nbsp;inch) guns were in place, but no [[gun turret|turrets]] or weapons had been mounted, so the holes in the main deck were covered with a [[mesh]]-like material. Her [[Hull (watercraft)|hull]] was finished, and a superstructure deck, [[Bridge (nautical)|bridge deck]] and [[conning tower]] had been fitted, along with a light signal [[Mast (sailing)|mast]] directly [[aft]] of the second barbette. The conning tower had to be outfitted as a bridge, as there was no other suitable location; compared with those of similar ships, it was much smaller, as it only contained two levels and [[bridge wing]]s. An exhaust pipe resembling an extremely small [[Chimney|funnel]] was fitted so that heat could be supplied within the ship.<ref name="Breyer350"/><ref name="Breyer229"/>

''Tosa'' remained in Kure until mid-1924. [[wikt:stricken|Stricken]] on 1 April 1924, the ship<U+2014>with her hull virtually finished<U+2014>was designated for use in testing the effectiveness of shells and torpedoes against its armor arrangements.<ref name="Conway's"/><ref name="G&D214">Garzke and Dulin, ''Battleships'', 214</ref>  As a result, in June 1924 the navy's gunnery school took possession of the hull and prepared it for testing.<ref name="Evans and Peattie, Kaigun, 246"/>

===Test target===
During 6<U+2013>13 June, ''Tosa'' was subjected to five explosions. The first involved a {{convert|100|kg|lb|abbr=on}} [[Mk. I mine]] placed on the [[starboard]] side of the ship, {{convert|3.7|m|ft|abbr=on}} below the [[waterline]] at [[frame (nautical)|frame 57]]. The resultant explosion ruptured about {{convert|22|m2|sqft|abbr=on}} of hull, while dishing in another {{convert|750|sqft|m2|abbr=on|0}} of plating. Flooding took 23 compartments within the ship, 17 quickly and five slowly; a total of {{convert|995|LT|t|lk=on|0}} of water entered the ship, increasing the ship's [[List (watercraft)|list]] to starboard by about {{degree|1}}&nbsp;54'.<ref name="G&D214-216">Garzke and Dulin, ''Battleships'', 214<U+2013>216</ref>

The second and fifth test charges (8 and 13 June) were both placed near the fore [[main battery]] [[magazine (artillery)|magazines]]. Involving larger charges than the first<U+2014>about {{convert|200|kg|lb|abbr=on}} (a [[Imperial Japanese Navy Technical Department#6th Year Type Torpedo|6th year type torpedo]]) and {{convert|150|kg|lb|abbr=on}} (a [[Imperial Japanese Navy Technical Department#9th year type mine|9th year type mine]])<U+2014>they were both placed at frame 87: the second to port and {{convert|4.04|m|ft|abbr=on}} below the waterline, the fifth to starboard and {{convert|6.34|m|ft|abbr=on}} below. Both broached the side protection system<U+2014>allowing 1,008 and 726 long tons (1,024 and 738 t) of water, respectively, to enter the ship<U+2014>showing that the usual three-compartment, all-void system used in most Japanese battleships was an insufficient defense against modern torpedoes. The list incurred during test two was a {{degree|6}}&nbsp;16' change, resulting in a port list of {{degree|4}}&nbsp;36'; for test five these numbers were {{degree|4}}&nbsp;38' and a starboard list of {{degree|0}}&nbsp;48'.<ref name="G&D214-216"/>

[[File:Tosa launch.jpg|thumb|left|upright|''Tosa''{{'}}s [[ship naming and launching|launch]], 18 December 1921|alt=A ship slides out from under a steel framework and into the water.]]
Similar to two and five, tests three and four were conducted at the same frame (192) but on opposite sides. Frame 192 was in the middle of the ship, where the ship's protection system was designed to be the strongest. Test three (8 June) was a {{convert|300|kg|lb|abbr=on}} [[Imperial_Japanese_Navy_Technical_Department#8th_Year_Type_Torpedo|8th year type torpedo]] on the starboard side at a depth of {{convert|4.05|m|ft|abbr=on}} under the ship's waterline; four (12 June) was a {{convert|350|kg|lb|abbr=on}} torpedo to port, {{convert|4.9|m|ft|abbr=on}} below the waterline. The tests ruptured 15 and 26&nbsp;m<sup>2</sup> (160 and 280&nbsp;sq&nbsp;ft), dished in 160 and 110&nbsp;m<sup>2</sup> (1,700 and 1,200&nbsp;sq&nbsp;ft) of plating, and allowed 1,203 and 1,160 long tons (1,222 and 1,180 t) of water to enter the ship. Test three allowed the most water in out of all of the tests and, as a result, the list was altered from a previous port-side {{degree|2}}&nbsp;51' to a starboard-side {{degree|5}}&nbsp;22'<U+2014>a change of {{degree|8}}&nbsp;13'. Test four went from a starboard {{degree|1}}&nbsp;0' to a port {{degree|5}}&nbsp;20'.<ref name="G&D214-216"/>

Further tests included the explosion of several Type 8 torpedoes filled with 300<U+2013>346&nbsp;kg (660<U+2013>760&nbsp;lbs) of [[picric acid]] within ''Tosa''{{'}}s designed magazine for them, which was located forward of the first turret and had been considered a weak point in previous battleship designs. This caused "extreme structural damage above the waterline" to ''Tosa'', and confirmed that any problem in that part of the ship could seriously harm it. Possible solutions included the installation of additional armor over the room or the use of walls on one side of the magazine that would be [[blowout panel|blown out and away]] from the ship in the event of any serious explosion inside. This would have the effect of focusing the explosion outside, minimizing structural damage to the ship itself. Another test involved the explosion of {{convert|370|kg|lb|abbr=on}} of [[Trinitrotoluene|TNT]] {{convert|5|m|ft|abbr=on}} away from the side of the ship.<ref>Garzke and Dulin, ''Battleships'', 214, 217</ref><ref>Lacroix, ''Japanese Cruisers'', 64</ref>

Another test conducted somewhere around this time involved a {{convert|406|mm|in|abbr=on}} gun firing a shell at ''Tosa''. It fell about {{convert|25|m|ft}} short of the ship, but continued through the water and struck the ship near frame 228, {{convert|3.3|m|ft}} below the designed [[waterline]]. The result was disturbing, as the shell was able to pass through the {{convert|76|mm|in|adj=on|abbr=on}} armor and explode in the port engine room. As a result, {{convert|3000|LT|t|0}} of water was let in, and ''Tosa''{{'}}s list was increased from {{degree|4}}&nbsp;53' to {{degree|10}}&nbsp;06'.<ref name="G&D214"/><ref>Lacroix and Wells, ''Japanese Cruisers of the Pacific War'', 758<U+2013>759</ref>

Results of the tests on ''Tosa'' were subsequently used in the refitting and reconstruction of existing warships.  Lessons learned were also incorporated into the designs of the two {{Sclass|Yamato|battleship|4}} superbattleships ten years later. In the latter, this meant that the side [[belt armor]] was continued below the [[waterline]] and beneath the [[torpedo bulge]] so that the class would have a defense against underwater shells.<ref name="Evans and Peattie, Kaigun, 246"/>

==Sinking==
[[File:Japanese battleship Tosa.jpg|thumb|right|300px|''Tosa'' being towed from Nagasaki on 1 August 1922|alt=A large and obviously unfinished ship surrounded by small tugboats belching smoke.]]
For the next few months, ''Tosa'' was given to the Hiroshima gunnery school for use as a target.<ref>Garzke and Dulin, ''Battleships'', 215</ref> On 14 January 1925, the [[Ministry of the Navy of Japan|Navy Ministry of Japan]] ordered ''Tosa'' to be [[scuttled]] within one month's time. To ensure this, the Commander in Chief of the [[Kure Naval District]] directed that preparations for scuttling the ship be completed by 1 February. It was planned that ''Tosa'' would be scuttled on or before 10 February after being towed by the former battleship {{Ship|Japanese battleship|Settsu||2}} to a location south of the [[Mizunokojima Lighthouse]] and {{convert|16.1|km|mi|0|sp=us}} west of [[Okinoshima, K<U+014D>chi|Okinoshima Island]] (located southwest of the present-day [[K<U+014D>chi Prefecture]]).<ref>Lengerer, "Battleships of the ''Kaga'' Class", 89</ref> Later that month, the United States [[Office of Naval Intelligence]] reported that "work on the dismantling of [''Tosa''] has been going on at the Kure Navy Yard and everything possible has been removed. The intention is to fill her hull with sand and gravel, tow her out to deep water near the entrance to Kure, open her sea cocks, and send her to the bottom."<ref>Office of Naval Intelligence, "Monthly Information Bulletin"</ref>

''Tosa'' was brought from Kure on 3 February to [[Saiki Bay]] in the [[Bungo Channel]].<ref>Jentschura, ''Warships'', 35</ref><ref name="Lengerer">Lengerer, "Battleships of the ''Kaga'' Class", 89<U+2013>90</ref> She was then towed from the bay on the 6th with the intention of bringing the battleship to the designated sinking spot, but were thwarted by a strong storm and returned. A second attempt was made at 10:00 on the 8th. Explosive "mines" were embarked: two {{convert|360|mm|in|1|adj=on|abbr=on}} shells were placed inside ''Tosa''{{'}}s [[double bottom]], and two containers with {{convert|30|kg|lb|abbr=on|0}} of [[Shimose powder]] in each were put into the engine room on the port side. They would be detonated using electrical fuses, though time fuses were also fitted for use if the sea was calm.<ref name="Lengerer"/> The explosives were triggered on the 8th, but they failed, so a contingent was sent aboard ''Tosa'' on the 9th; they opened six [[Kingston valve]]s in the engine room at about 01:25. Soon after, ''Tosa'' slowly began to sink by the stern and to starboard. By 03:50, the rate increased, and the ship slipped beneath the waves by 07:00.<ref name="Lengerer"/> ''Tosa'' was the tenth and final Japanese capital ship sunk or [[ship breaking|scrapped]] to comply with the naval treaty's stipulations.<ref name="Fleischer">Fleischer, "Says Japan's Navy"</ref>{{#tag:ref|The other nine were {{Ship|Japanese battleship|Aki||2}}, {{Ship|Japanese battleship|Satsuma||2}}, {{Ship|Japanese battleship|Hizen||2}}, {{Ship|Japanese cruiser|Ikoma||2}}, {{Ship|Japanese battlecruiser|Ibuki||2}}, {{Ship|Japanese battleship|Kashima||2}}, {{Ship|Japanese battlecruiser|Kurama||2}}, {{Ship|Japanese battleship|Katori||2}}, and {{Ship|Japanese battlecruiser|Amagi||2}}.<ref name="Fleischer"/>|group=N}}
