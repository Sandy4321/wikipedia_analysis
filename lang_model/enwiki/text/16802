'''The Storys''' were a six-piece band from [[Swansea]], [[Wales]], [[United Kingdom|UK]] who formed in Spring 2003. Their main influence is 1970s U.S. West Coast bands in the country-rock genre.  The lineup is [[Steve Balsamo]] - vocals/guitar; Andy Collins <U+2013> vocals/bass; Dai Smith <U+2013> vocals/guitar; Rob Thompson <U+2013> vocals/guitar; Brian Thomas <U+2013> drums/percussion; Alan Thomas <U+2013> keys/mandolin/banjo.

==Chapter One==
The group featured four singer-songwriters all taking lead vocals on different songs. They count as inspirations such  vocal harmony-based bands as [[Fleetwood Mac]], [[The Eagles]], [[Crosby, Stills & Nash (and Young)|Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young]] and [[The Beatles]]. 

Over thirty songs were recorded, with eleven eventually chosen for their debut album. The Storys then decided to put out the album themselves, so they set up their own label, Hall Recordings, before signing a record deal with Warner Bros./Korova.

Their first gig was to over seventy thousand people at The Olympic Torch Concert outside [[Buckingham Palace]], and was soon followed by a support slot with [[Tom Jones (singer)|Tom Jones]] and a series of gigs in venues such as Bush Hall and The Borderline. More recently, the band have been on tour supporting [[Elton John]].

==The Epilogue - Dai Smith Quits==
In Spring 2008 Dai Smith went absent due to so called ill health. Dai was a major contributor in terms of songwriting as well as the production.

At the liberty stadium gig supporting Elton John in June 2008 Dai was missing from the onstage line-up and as a result was replaced with a female vocalist, this changed the band's distinctive sound and the overall dynamic.  Dai has not been played with the band since this time.

In their local rag South Wales Evening Post 16th August 2008 the following article appeared regarding Dai's departure:

Dai Smith has quit The Storys after five years with the band, it has been confirmed.The guitarist and vocalist announced his decision just days before the group's gig supporting Van Morrison in London on Saturday.

Dai told the Post: "After a lot of thought, I have decided to leave the band.

"My reasons are varied, but, basically, I feel it is time to move on and pursue some other adventures in music.

"I have had a great five years with the band and have fulfilled many dreams and gained some fantastic experiences along the way.

The band - which supported Elton John at his Swansea gig in June, without Dai - will continue as a five-piece.

Lead singer Steve Balsamo said: "It's unfortunate that he has decided to leave the band.

"We all remain good friends and wish him the best of luck with his future musical endeavours."

==Album Review - The Town Beyond The Trees==
The snare taps out it<U+2019>s beat, an organ begins to swell, guitars chime and the throaty vocal stylings of lead singer Steve Balsamo, (formerly a <U+2018>Jesus Christ: Superstar<U+2019> and the proud owner of a Ken Bruce Single of the Week for solo outing <U+2018>All I Am<U+2019>) begins to tell its well worn story. This is <U+2018>Long Hard Road<U+2019>, the lead single from the sophomore effort by Swansea 6 piece The Storys. The concept road is a fitting one for the band, as this record sees them so far entrenched in <U+2018>middle of the road<U+2019> territory they are in danger of becoming musical equivalent of cats eyes.

The Storys present a nauseating take on West coast pop and Americana here, citing The Eagles, Crosby Stills and Nash and The Flying Burrito Brothers as influences. However, they actually produce a sound closer to Brian Adams most saccharine of ballads.Guitars chime, organs swell and cliche ridden lyrics come ten a penny throughout the record. <U+2018>Town Beyond The Trees<U+2019> is so utterly bereft of originality that it comes across as the product of a <U+2018>pop-idol<U+2019> style band, not caring what music it is that gets them <U+2018>There<U+2019>, so long as it does. Pedestrian rhythm sections, delayed guitars, fade outs and even the odd cod-gospel singer appear at points on the record, which for the most part sounds like the product of a group of bored session musicians. The fact that the vocals are delivered in a West Coast American accent further emphasises the shallow, false feeling of <U+2018>Town Beyond The Trees<U+2019>.

Lyrically, it<U+2019>s full of boy-band schmaltz such as <U+201C>I can<U+2019>t lie babe, you<U+2019>re still in my dreams/ is this the way your feeling too/I hope you feel the same way too<U+201D>, and other aspirations to <U+2018>be the one<U+2019> and <U+2018>take stars out from the sky<U+2019>. At times, it even strays into <U+2018>Christian Rock<U+2019>(capital C, capital R) territory, as on <U+201C>Heaven Holds You Know<U+201D>, with it<U+2019>s assertion that <U+2018>You are my light/ you are my guiding hand/ in a world that has lost its meaning/You seem to understand<U+2019>.

It should come as no surprise then, that The Storys have shared stages with the likes of Katie Melua, and were the requested tour support for Sir Elton John. The band will also appear in forthcoming Jason Statham movie <U+2018>The Bank Job<U+2019>, for which they provided three tracks to the soundtrack. No doubt this will take their music to a wider audience, who may just lap up this cliche ridden, plodding, achingly dull excuse of a record.  Don't waste a penny on this trash.....hit delete, go to sleep, take up knitting, get a tattoo, have botex, any of these will be time better spent than having to endure anymore of this nonsense. Music for the lumpenproletariat, as in the title of 2nd track "You Couldn't Make It Up", the paradox is that this bunch somehow have got money from someone to do it.

Coincidentally this is Mr. Balsamo's third outing in trying to attain success in "the business", dumped twice before by the major labels, his endurance has to be admired despite his previous failures. I have read how nice he is but nice doesn't sell records - good songs do. The problem with his music is it's of another era and without being The Eagles, Crosby, Stills, Nash, whoever, without that pedigree and history it's doomed to fail, again, again, again and again.  Unless Mr. Balsamo grasps this concept and starts to write exceptional songs, or changes his style for something more original he and his band will be consigned to the musical abyss were they currently stand forever.
