The '''El Paso and Southwestern Railroad''' was a [[short-line railroad|short-line]] [[United States|American]] [[railway company]] which operated in [[Arizona]], [[New Mexico]], and [[Texas]], which line extensions across the international boarder into [[Mexico]]. The railroad operated from 1888 to 1961, and was known as the '''Arizona and South Eastern Railroad''' from 1888 to 1901.

==Founding==
[[James Douglas (businessman)|James Douglas]] was a former professor of [[chemistry]] working for [[William E. Dodge, Jr.]] and [[Daniel Willis James]], majority co-owners of the [[Phelps Dodge|Phelps, Dodge Corporation]].<ref name="Americana">Beach and Rines, ''The Americana: A Universal Reference Library,'' 1911.</ref><ref name="Cleland">Cleland, ''A History of Phelps Dodge: 1834-1950,'' 1952.</ref> Phelps, Dodge was entering the [[Copper extraction techniques|copper mining]] industry, and had hired Douglas to make an inspection of [[mineral rights|mining claims]] in the [[Southwestern United States]]. Douglas suggested that the two men invest in the [[Detroit Copper Mining Company of Arizona]], which owned a copper mining claim in [[Warren, Arizona]].<ref name="Cleland" /> In 1881, Phelps, Dodge not only took a controlling interest in the Detroit Copper Mining Company but also purchased a minority interest in the adjoining [[Copper Queen Mine]] in [[Bisbee, Arizona]].<ref name="Cleland" /><ref name="Whitten">Whitten, Whitten and Sisaye, ''The Birth of Big Business in the United States, 1860-1914: Commercial, Extractive, and Industrial Enterprise,'' 2005.</ref> After the Copper Queen and Detroit Copper both struck the [[Atlanta lode]]<ref>"Phelps Dodge Corporation," in ''International Directory of Company Histories,'' 2006.</ref> in 1884, Phelps, Dodge bought out the remaining interest in the Copper Queen. The company merged its various mining interests into the [[Copper Queen Consolidated Mining Company]] in 1885, and installed Douglas as president and part-owner.<ref name="Americana" /><ref name="Cleland" /><ref name="Whitten" />

With production in the Bisbee expanding, Douglas formed the Arizona and South Eastern Railroad in 1888.<ref name="Americana" /><ref name="Whitten" /> The railroad ran on a short spur of track from Bisbee to [[Tombstone, Arizona|Fairbanks, Arizona]],<ref>Sagi, "Where Southern Arizona's Ghosts Gather by the River," ''Associated Content,'' November 9, 2007.</ref> where it met the [[Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway|Santa Fe Railroad]].<ref name="Americana" /><ref name="Whitten" />  Shortly thereafter the line was extended to [[Benson, Arizona]], to connect with the [[Southern Pacific Transportation Company|Southern Pacific Railroad]].<ref name="Whitten"/> Copper Queen Consolidated built a new smelter at the newly built town of [[Douglas, Arizona]] (named for James Douglas), to which the railroad was extended again.<ref name="Americana" />  The line was renamed the El Paso and Southwestern Railroad on [[June 25]], [[1901]], to reflect its larger scope (even though it did not yet extend to [[El Paso, Texas]]).<ref name="Americana" />

==Expansion==
James and Dodge, meanwhile, had acquired the [[Moctezuma Copper Company]] in the state of [[Sonora]] in [[Mexico]], and in 1902 the El Paso and Southwestern line was extended south from Douglas to the Mexican town of [[Nacozari de Garc<U+00ED>a]].<ref name="Americana" /><ref name="Whitten" /><ref>Truett, ''Fugitive Landscapes: The Forgotten History of the U.S.-Mexico Borderlands,'' 2006.</ref> The [[Nacorazi Railroad]], owned by Moctezuma Copper Co. and used to transport ore to the Moctezuma smelter at Nacozari, was incorporated into the El Paso and Southwestern.<ref name="Americana" />

Phelps, Dodge continued to expand, and in time purchased copper mines near [[Morenci, Arizona]]. A subsidiary of the El Paso and Southwestern<U+2014>the Morenci Southern<U+2014>was incorporated on [[June 6]], [[1902]], and its roadbed connected the Morenci mines to the [[Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway |New Mexico and Arizona Railroad]] (a division of the Santa Fe Railroad).<ref name="Americana" /><ref name="Cravens">Cravens, "El Paso and Southwestern Railroad," in ''The New Handbook of Texas,'' 1996.</ref>

In 1903, the terminus of the El Paso and Southwestern was extended from Douglas to El Paso by building new track as well as purchasing track from the [[El Paso and Northeastern Railroad]], adding over 200 miles of roadway to the line.<ref name="Whitten" /> The purchase of the [[Dawson Railway]] also extended the railroad's reach to [[Dawson, New Mexico]], where Phelps, Dodge had recently acquired coal mines to feed its smelting operations.<ref name="Americana" /> Near [[Deming, New Mexico]], the new track had to cross the line of the Southern Pacific Railroad.<ref name="Abue">Aub<U+00E9>, ''The 48th,'' 2005.</ref> Aware that the Southern Pacific had only two watchmen on the route, the El Paso and Southern stopped all trains on either side of the junction and laid its new track across that of the Southern Pacific.<ref name="Abue" /> In one day, the El Paso and Southwestern ran more than 500 fully laden [[hopper car]]s across the new junction to establish a [[Right-of-way (transportation)|right-of-way]].<ref name="Abue" /> The Southern Pacific sued and won a [[injunction|temporary injunction]], but the injunction was never enforced and the El Paso and Southwestern continued to cross the Southern Pacific's line.<ref name="Abue" />

After the deaths of Dodge in 1903 and James in 1907, the various Phelps, Dodge railroads, mining companies, real estate firms, and other subsidiaries and divisions were all merged into Phelps, Dodge and Company.<ref name="Americana" /><ref name="Whitten" />

The railroad's expansion continued gradually, and by 1917 the El Paso and Southwestern Railroad had more than 1,000 miles of track in operation.<ref name="Whitten" /><ref name="Abue" /> However, the same year saw the railroad involved in a terrible breach of civil liberties. During the [[Bisbee Deportation]], railroad officials collaborated with their counterparts in the Phelps, Dodge mining subsidiaries to [[deportation|deport]] more than 1,300 [[strike action|striking]] mine workers, their supporters, and innocent citizen bystanders from the twon of Bisbee more than 200 miles to the town of [[Hermanas, New Mexico]].<ref>Jensen, ''Heritage of Conflict: Labor Relations in the Nonferrous Metals Industry up to 1930,'' 1950; Foner, ''History of the Labor Movement in the United States. Vol. 7: Labor and World War I, 1914<U+2013>1918,'' 1987; Dubofsky, ''We Shall Be All: A History of the Industrial Workers of the World,'' 2000; Byrkit, "The Bisbee Deportation," in ''American Labor in the Southwest,'' 1982.</ref>

==Demise==
The worldwide collapse of copper prices after [[World War I]]<ref>Herfindahl, ''Copper Costs and Prices: 1870-1957,'' 1959.</ref> severely affected not only the railroad's financial fortunes but those of the mining companies it served.<ref name="Cleland" /> In 1924, the Southern Pacific leased the entire El Paso and Southwest Railroad from Phelps, Dodge.<ref name="Cleland" /><ref name="Cravens" /> In November 1937, the rairoad purchased the oustanding interest in the El Paso and Northeastern Railroad.<ref name="Whitten" /><ref name="Cravens" /> It acquired the El Paso Southern Railway Company in December 1954.<ref name="Cravens" />

The El Paso and Southwestern Railroad was purchased from Phelps, Dodge and merged into the Southern Pacific on [[November 1]], [[1961]].<ref name="Cravens" />

==Route and notable buildings==
Highways follow most of the route of the El Paso and Southwestern Railroad.  Beginning in Tucson, Arizona, [[Arizona State Route 80]] (formerly [[U.S. Route 80]], but decommissioned in 1964 after [[Interstate 10]] was built) largely parallels the railroad grade south to Douglas. Arizona Route 80 then follows the old tracks northeast to [[Rodeo, New Mexico]]. The tracks diverge from the highway here, and largely follow Gas Line Road until it intersects with [[New Mexico State Road 9]] near [[Animus, New Mexico]]. New Mexico State Road 9 runs next to or on top of the old railroad grade until it reaches El Paso, Texas.

The northern Arizona spur of the railroad may be followed by following [[U.S. Route 191]] north from Douglas to Morenci, Arizona. The Mexican spur may be followed by beginning in Douglas, crossing the international border into Mexico, and following [[Mexican Federal Highway 14]] to Nacozari de Garc<U+00ED>a. The northern New Mexican spur parallels or is underneath [[Interstate 25]], and then taking [[New Mexico State Road 505]] (which intersects Interstate 25 at [[Maxwell, New Mexico]]) to [[Colfax, New Mexico]].  The Dawson Road travels the remainder of the spur from Colfax to the ghost town of Dawson.

Several El Paso and Southwestern buildings are on the [[National Register of Historic Places]]. Among these are the [[El Paso and Southwestern Railroad Depot]] at 419 W. Congress Street in Tucson, Arizona;<ref>[http://www.nationalregisterofhistoricplaces.com/az/Pima/state.html "El Paso and Southwestern Railroad Depot (added 2004 - Building - #03000903)."
