'''Alexander McNair''' (May 5, 1775&nbsp;<U+2013> March 18, 1826) was an [[United States|American]] [[frontiersman]] and [[politician]]. He was the [[List of Governors of Missouri|first Governor]] of [[Missouri]] from its entry as a state in 1820, until 1824.

McNair was born in [[Lancaster, Pennsylvania]] and grew up in [[Mifflin County, Pennsylvania]]. His grandfather, David McNair, Sr., immigrated to Pennsylvania from Donaghmore, [[County Donegal]], [[Ireland]] around 1733 and had Scottish ancestors from [[Loch Lomond]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Stevens|first=Walter B.|chapter=Alexander McNair|title=The messages and proclamations of the Governors of the State of Missouri, Volume 1|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=RhYZAAAAYAAJ|publisher=State Historical Society of Missouri|year=1922}}</ref> David McNair, Jr., Alexander's father (b. 1736), fought with General George Washington in the Trenton and Princeton campaigns in the winter of 1776-77, and died in February, 1777 as a result of wounds received in battle and exposure when Alexander was less than two years old.  Alexander went to school as a child, and attended one term at the College of Philadelphia (now the [[University of Pennsylvania]]). He reached an agreement with his mother and brothers that the brothers would have a boxing match and that the winner would receive the father's property. Alexander was defeated. He became a member of the Pennsylvania militia and fought for the government in the [[Whiskey Rebellion]] in 1791 and 1794.

In 1804, McNair traveled to what is now Missouri, the United States having just acquired it following the [[Louisiana Purchase]]. In that year he married Marguerite Suzanne de Reihle de Regal, the daughter of a French marquis. He lived in [[St. Louis, Missouri]], participated in [[Freemasonry]] as a member of [[St. Louis Lodge 111]], and served as a [[United States Marshal]]. He also became a successful businessman, and served two terms on the Board of Trustees of the Town of St. Louis, in 1808 and 1813.

On May 24, 1813, [[Stephen F. Austin]], who was later responsible for the colonization of [[Texas]], and for whom [[Austin, Texas]] is named, was commissioned an ensign in the Missouri militia. Later in September, he enlisted as a private in the First Regiment of Mounted Militia commanded by Colonel Alexander McNair.

McNair was elected governor in 1820, receiving 72% of the vote and defeating the famous explorer [[William Clark (explorer)|William Clark]]. After his time as governor, he worked in the Indian Department until his death. He died of [[influenza]], and is buried in [[Calvary Cemetery (St. Louis)|Calvary Cemetery]] in St. Louis.
