On February 10, 2007, [[Barack Obama]], then junior [[United States]] [[United States Senate|Senator]] from [[Illinois]], announced his candidacy for [[President of the United States|the presidency of the United States]] in [[Springfield, Illinois]]. On June 3, 2008, he secured enough delegates to become the [[presumptive nominee]] of the [[United States Democratic Party|Democratic Party]] for the [[United States presidential election, 2008|2008 presidential election]]. He is the first [[African-American]] in [[American History]] to be nominated by a major party. On November 4, 2008, Obama won the presidential election and currently serves as the 44th President of the United States, succeeding [[George W. Bush]]. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nytimes.com/cq/2007/01/31/cq_2214.html|title="Obama Sets Feb. 10 Event to Reveal Plans, Rebuffs Biden<U+2019>s Gaffe"|publisher=[[The New York Times]]|date=[[January 31]], [[2007]]|accessdate=2008-03-23|last=Horrigan|first=Marie}}</ref>

In March 2007, the Obama campaign posted a question on [[Yahoo! Answers]], entitled: "How can we engage more people in the democratic process?" which ultimately drew in over 17,000 responses.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20070321123705AAUBCyH|title=How can we engage more people in the democratic process?|publisher=Yahoo!

On [[May 3]], [[2007]], citing no specific threat but motivated by the large volume of [[hate mail]] directed at the Senator, Secretary of Homeland Security [[Michael Chertoff]] announced that the [[United States Secret Service]] would provide protection for the campaign, including bodyguards for Obama and other services/resources similar to those employed for the safety of the President of the United States, albeit on a proportionally smaller level. Normally, presidential candidates are not offered Secret Service protection until early February of election year; this was the earliest protection had ever been granted.<ref>{{cite news|first=Helen|last=Kennedy|title=Obama Gets Earliest-Ever Secret Service Detail|date=[[May 4]] [[2007]]|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/news/wn_report/2007/05/04/2007-05-04_raising_his_guard.html|work=New York Daily News|accessdate=2007-11-18}} Senator [[Hillary Rodham Clinton]] was already under Secret Service protection because of her status as wife of former President [[Bill Clinton]].</ref>

On August 1 when making his foreign policy speech Obama created controversy by declaring that the United States must be willing to strike al Qaeda targets inside [[Pakistan]], with or without the consent of the Pakistani government. He stated that if elected, "If we have actionable intelligence about high value terrorist targets and President Musharraf won't act, we will."<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.reuters.com/article/domesticNews/idUSN0132206420070801 | title=Tough talk on Pakistan from Obama | work=Reuters |date=[[August 1]], [[2007]] |accessdate=2008-03-23}}</ref> [[ABC News]] described the policy speech as "counterintuitive," and commented on how "one of the more liberal candidates in the race, is proposing a geopolitical posture that is more aggressive than that of President Bush"<ref>{{cite news|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/Story?id=3434573&page=1|title=Obama Delivers Bold Speech About War on Terror|work=ABC News|author=Jake Tapper|date=[[August 1]], [[2007]]|accessdate=2008-02-16}}</ref>

After weeks of discourse surrounding the policy, Obama said there was "misreporting" of his comments, stating that, "I never called for an invasion of Pakistan or Afghanistan." He clarified that rather than a surge in the number of troops in Iraq, there needs to be a "diplomatic surge" and that if there were "actionable intelligence reports" showing al-Qaida leader Osama bin Laden in Pakistan, the U.S. troops as a last resort should enter and try to capture terrorists. That would happen, he added, only if "the Pakistani government was unable or unwilling" to go after the terrorists.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.siouxcityjournal.com/articles/2007/08/07/news/top/8d9e96c628c098008625732f008341f5.txt|title="Obama revisits Pakistan statement"|publisher=''Sioux City Journal''|date=[[August 7]] [[2007]]|accessdate=2008-03-23|last=Hayworth|first=Bret}}</ref>

As Democratic debates took place during the summer, Obama received at best mixed notices for his efforts. Democratic strategist [[Bob Shrum]] said, "He slips into this tendency, which he probably learned as president of the Harvard Law Review, to overstate his premises before he states his position. In politics, you do the opposite of what you do in the Law Review<U+2014>you state your position, then say your premises<U+2014>if you ever get to them."<ref name="nw112307">{{cite news | url=http://www.newsweek.com/id/71708 | title=President of the Debate Team | author=[[Eleanor Clift]] | date=[[2007-11-23]] | accessdate=2007-12-11 | publisher=[[Newsweek]]}}</ref> Commentator [[Eleanor Clift]] said that, "Obama is almost too cerebral for the sound-bite world of modern politics, but that's part of his appeal."<ref name="nw112307"/>

During a campaign stop in October 2007, a reporter inquired as to why Obama had stopped wearing a [[lapel pin]] of the [[Flag of the United States|American flag]], which he had started wearing after the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]], and his response was that it had come to feel like "a substitute for true patriotism." This led to discussion on the [[News broadcasting|cable news]] channels and was covered by satirists such as [[Stephen Colbert]], who had an ongoing disagreement with the ''[[Fox & Friends]]'' assertion that "this is America and if you want to be president of ''America'', it might be [sic] behoove him to wear an ''American'' flag." Commentator [[Bill Maher]], who was highly critical of such questions about Obama's [[patriotism]] and called it a "non-story" nonetheless referred to the incident as "[t]he first genuine controversy of the presidential campaign."<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.salon.com/opinion/feature/2007/10/12/flag_pins/index.html?source=rss&aim=opinion | title=American flag pins are for idiots | author=[[Bill Maher]] | publisher=[[Salon (magazine)|Salon]] | date=[[2007-10-12]] | accessdate=2007-12-11}}</ref>

In mid-late October 2007, Obama came under fire from the [[Human Rights Campaign]] and others for a South Carolina [[gospel music]] campaign tour that featured singer [[Donnie McClurkin]], who states that he is "[[ex-gay]]" and that homosexuality is a "curse [that runs against] the intention of God."<ref name="adv102707">{{citation|date=[[October 27]], [[2007]]|title=Obama Explains Why He's the Best Candidate for LGBT Americans |periodical=[[The Advocate]] |url=http://advocate.com/news_detail_ektid50021.asp |accessdate=[[2007-10-26]] |first=Kerry |last=Eleveld}}</ref><ref name="ap102307">{{cite news | url=http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2007/10/23/obama-takes-heat-for-link-to-mcclurkin/ | title=Obama takes heat for link to McClurkin | publisher=[[Associated Press]] for [[CNN]] | date=[[2007-10-23]] | accessdate=2007-12-11}}</ref> Obama said in response that, "I strongly believe that African Americans and the LGBT community must stand together in the fight for equal rights.

In what has been deemed the "Yes We Can" speech, Obama acknowledged that he faced a fight for the nomination and that "nothing can stand in the way of the power of millions of voices calling for change."<ref>[http://apnews.myway.com/article/20080109/D8U24PH80.html Obama Says He's Still Fired Up and Ready] Associated Press, Jan. 8, 2008</ref> The lyrics to the song in ''[[Yes We Can]],'' an [[eponym]]ous music video created by celebrity supporters of Obama, was entirely made up of pieces of this particular speech.

Meanwhile, Internet theories sprung up about how the vote counting itself had been suspect, due to discrepancies between machine-counted votes (which supported Clinton overall) and hand-counted votes (which supported Obama overall).<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.electiondefensealliance.org/new_hampshire_2008_primary_analysis | title=UPDATED New Hampshire 2008 Primary Analysis | publisher=Election Defense Alliance | date=[[2008-01-15]] | accessdate=2008-01-18}}</ref>  Fifth-place finisher [[Dennis Kucinich]]'s [[Dennis Kucinich presidential campaign, 2008|campaign]] paid $25,000 to have a [[election recount|recount]] done of all Democratic ballots cast in the primary, saying "It is imperative that these questions be addressed in the interest of public confidence in the integrity of the election process and the election machinery." On [[January 16]] the [[New Hampshire Secretary of State]]<U+2019>s office began the recount. After recounting 23 percent of the state's democratic primary votes, the Secretary of State announced that no significant difference was found in any candidate's total, and that the oft-discussed discrepancy between hand-counted and machine-counted ballots was solely due to demographic factors.

===Nevada===
The [[Nevada Democratic caucuses, 2008|Nevada Caucus]] took place on [[January 19]]. Obama received the endorsement of two very important unions in the state: the [[Culinary Workers Union]] (whose 60,000 members staff the casinos and resorts of [[Las Vegas, Nevada|Las Vegas]] and elsewhere) and the Nevada chapter of the [[Service Employees International Union|SEIU]]. Clinton countered by appealing to the [[Hispanic]] vote in the state, emphasizing that they were at special risk from the fallout from the [[2007 subprime mortgage financial crisis|subprime mortgage crisis]].

Prior to the caucus, comments made by Obama concerning former Republican president [[Ronald Reagan]] attracted rebuke from rivals and dissection from all sections of the media. Obama had stated in an interview that; "Ronald Reagan changed the trajectory of America in a way that Richard Nixon did not and in a way that Bill Clinton did not."<ref>{{cite news | url = http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,25197,23092595-7583,00.html | title = The Gipper lives | first = John | last = O'Sullivan | publisher = The Australian | date = [[2008-01-23]] | accessdate = 2008-02-09}}</ref> Hillary Clinton ridiculed the idea that the Republicans were the party of ideas, suggesting Mr. Obama had said that the Republicans had <U+201C>better<U+201D> ideas.<ref>{{cite news | url = http://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/21/us/politics/21web-seelye.html | title = Obama, Reagan and the Internet | publisher = The New York Times | date = [[2008-01-21]]}}</ref> Senator John Edwards criticized Obama specifically for referring to Ronald Reagan as an agent of change stating in a newspaper interview that; <U+201C>I would never use Ronald Reagan as an example of change.<U+201D><ref>{{cite news | url = http://firstread.msnbc.msn.com/archive/2008/01/17/585313.aspx | title = Edwards criticizes Obama on Reagan | publisher = MSNBC | date= [[2008-01-17]]}}</ref>

One day after the Culinary Workers Union endorsed Obama, the Nevada State Education Association<U+2014>a teachers' union that while not officially endorsing Clinton, had top officials who did<U+2014>filed a lawsuit seeking to eliminate at-large caucus sites that had been setup in nine Las Vegas resorts saying they violated equal protection and one-person-one-vote requirements. The suit was viewed as a proxy legal battle between Clinton and Obama, as the caucus sites within the casinos would be primarily used by members of the CWU, who are more likely to vote for Obama. This led Obama to allege that the suit was filed in order to hurt his chances at the caucuses. "Some of the people who set up the rules apparently didn't think we'd be as competitive as we were and trying to change them last minute," he said.<ref name=judge/>

On [[January 17]], a federal judge ruled that the casino at-large caucus plan could go ahead. This was seen as a win for Obama because of the Culinary Workers Union endorsement.<ref name=judge>{{cite news | url=http://www.cnn.com/2008/POLITICS/01/17/casino.caucuses/ | title= Judge allows casino caucuses to proceed | publisher=[[CNN]] | date=[[2008-01-17]] | accessdate=2008-01-17}}</ref> To further complicate matters, the major news and polling organizations decided to not do any polls before the Nevada caucuses, fearing the newness of the caucus, the transient nature of Nevada's population, and more fallout from their bad experience in New Hampshire.

Clinton finished first in the state delegate count on January 19, winning 51% of delegates to the state convention.<ref>{{cite news |title=Clinton, Romney win in Nevada |url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/22739349/ |work=[[Associated Press]] |publisher=[[MSNBC]] |date=2008-01-19 |accessdate=2008-03-28 }}</ref> However, Obama was projected to win the Nevada national delegate count with 13 delegates to Clinton's 12, because the apportionment of some delegates are determined by Congressional District.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.politico.com/blogs/bensmith/0108/Delegate_wrap_Technicalities_within_technicalities.html |title=Delegate wrap: Technicalities within technicalities |accessdate=2008-03-28 |last=Smith |first=Ben |date=2008-01-20 |work=Ben Smith's Blog |publisher=[[The Politico|Politico]]}}</ref> Delegates to the national convention were determined officially at the April 19 state convention.

[[Rasmussen Reports]] released a poll [[January 7]] showing that Obama led by 12 points, at 42% to Hillary Clinton's 30%.

===Florida and Michigan===
The [[Florida Democratic primary, 2008|Florida]] and [[Michigan Democratic primary, 2008|Michigan]] primaries were held on January 29th and 15th, respectively. However, the states were previously stripped of all its delegates to the national convention for breaking party rules by moving its primary to before February 5. All candidates abided by an agreement not to campaign in Florida, and all major candidates except for Hillary Clinton had removed their names from the Michigan ballot.<ref name="latimes-clinton-triumph">{{cite news | url = http://www.latimes.com/news/printedition/asection/la-na-clinton30jan30,1,5497322.story | title = Clinton 'triumphs' in Florida, sort of | first = Peter | last = Nicholas | publisher = Los Angeles Times | date = [[2008-01-30]] | accessdate = 2008-02-09}}</ref> Nonetheless, Clinton celebrated the 'wins' and asserted that they gave her momentum heading to Super Tuesday.

On [[May 31]] [[2008]] the [[Democratic National Committee]] Rules and Bylaws Commission met to resolve questions surrounding the contentious Florida and Michigan primaries.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.itv.com/News/Articles/Obama-in-pole-position-631728669.html|title=Obama in pole position|publisher=ITV|date=2008-06-01|accessdate=2008-06-06}}</ref> In the case of Florida, it was decided that the delegate distribution would be based on the primary results as they stood and the delegation would be seated in full, but with each delegate receiving half a vote. In the case of Michigan, the delegate distribution was based on an estimate that took into consideration factors such as the actual primary results, exiting polling, and surveys of voter preference among those who did not participate in the Michigan primary. The end result rewarded Senator Clinton with 69 delegates and Senator Obama 59. As with Florida, each delegate would be given a half vote.

Barack's response to the criticism was, "Statements like this are made and people try to take it out of context and make a great big deal out of it, and that isn't at all what she meant. What she meant was, this is the first time that she's been proud of the politics of America," he said.

===Pennsylvania===
[[Image:PhilltObama.JPG|thumb|right|Volunteers in line Saturday morning, April 19, 2008 at the Obama campaign office in North Philadelphia. (Girard Ave. & Broad St.)]]
After Obama's win in Mississippi on March 11, 2008, the campaign turned its attention to Pennsylvania. [[Statewide opinion polling for the Democratic Party presidential primaries, 2008#Pennsylvania|Mid March]] polls by Rasmussen Reports,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://rasmussenreports.com/public_content/politics/election_20082/2008_presidential_election/pennsylvania/pennsylvania_democratic_presidential_primary|title=Pennsylvania Democratic Presidential Primary}}</ref> [[Franklin & Marshall College]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://edisk.fandm.edu/FLI/keystone/pdf/keymar08_1.pdf|title=Survey of Pennsylvanians - Summary of Findings|format=PDF}}</ref> [[Quinnipiac University]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.quinnipiac.edu/x1327.xml?ReleaseID=1158|title=Clinton Widens Lead Over Obama In Pennsylvania, Quinnipiac University Poll Finds; Momentum Shifts To Her, But Racial Split Grows}}</ref> and Public Policy Polling<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.publicpolicypolling.com/pdf/PPP_Penn_Release_031708.pdf|title=Clinton has large lead in Pennsylvania|format=PDF}}</ref> had Obama trailing Senator Clinton in Pennsylvania by 12 to 16 points.

Speaking about small-town Pennsylvania at a private April 6 fundraising event in Kentfield, CA, a small suburb of San Francisco located in neighboring Marin County, his remarks would be widely criticized after they were reported:
<blockquote>You go into these small towns in Pennsylvania, and like a lot of small towns in the Midwest, the jobs have been gone now for 25 years and nothing's replaced them. And they fell through the Clinton Administration, and the Bush Administration, and each successive administration has said that somehow these communities are gonna regenerate and they have not. And it's not surprising, then, they get bitter, they cling to guns or religion or antipathy to people who aren't like them or anti-immigrant sentiment or anti-trade sentiment as a way to explain their frustrations.<ref>Bacon, Perry and Murray, Shailagh. [http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/story/2008/04/12/ST2008041200232.html "Opponents Paint Obama as an Elitist"], ''Washington Post'' ([[2008-04-12]]).

Hillary Clinton described the remarks as "elitist, out of touch and frankly patronizing."<ref name=autogenerated2>"Only in America" Newsweek May 5, 2008</ref> Noting he had not chosen his words well, Obama subsequently explained his remarks, "Lately there has been a little typical sort of political flare-up, because I said something that everybody knows is true, which is that there are a whole bunch of folks in small towns in Pennsylvania, in towns right here in Indiana, in my hometown in Illinois, who are bitter."<ref>Finnegan, Michael.

Just hours prior Obama's remarks in San Francisco, he spoke in [[Silicon Valley]] at another private event, and expressed a much more nuanced understanding of the second amendment and rural America. He stated, 

<blockquote>We need sensible gun laws. I just got back from Montana where just about everyone has guns. In that culture, fathers and sons bond over hunting. You can't take that away from rural America. But the inner city is different, and we should tighten the laws on gun purchases and close the loopholes in gun show sales to unscrupulous buyers. The gun control people and the right to bear arms people are talking past each other about disconnected topics.</blockquote>

That Obama's comments in San Francisco made wide media play but not the ones he spoke in Silicon Valley became a source of speculation about the media and its political coverage.<ref>Sam Stein, "Before Bitter-Gate: What Obama Said Hours Earlier About Guns," ''The Huffington Post'', 13 May 2008, [http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2008/05/13/before-bitter-gate-what-o_n_101493.html Available online.] [http://www.webcitation.org/5XnK4p2vH Archived.]</ref>

The last big event in the final week of the campaign was the April 16 debate on ABC-TV. Many pundits gave the edge to Hillary Clinton, though many were critical of moderators [[Charles Gibson]] and [[George Stephanopoulos]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.npr.org/watchingwashington/2008/04/the_proper_pennsylvania_lesson.html| title=NPR: The Proper Pennsylvania Lesson for Obama|author=Ron Elving|work=Watching Washington|publisher=NPR|date=2008-04-23|accessdate=2008-06-06}}</ref>  A [[Obama-Ayers controversy|two-month-old controversy]] gained more exposure when Stephanopoulos questioned Obama during the debate about Obama's contacts with [[Weather Underground]] founder [[Bill Ayers]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.boston.com/news/nation/articles/2008/04/17/fact_check_obama_clinton_and_the_weather_underground/|publisher=Associated Press|title=Fact check: Obama, Clinton and the Weather Underground|date=April 17, 2008}}</ref>

Clinton won states like Ohio and Pennsylvania largely because of just such a voter base. However, there were positive signs for Obama as well.

Obama got a boost in Indiana when the former head of the state's Democratic party, Joe Andrew, endorsed him. Andrew, a superdelegate, also previously served as the chairman of the Democratic National Committee from 1999&ndash;2001, a position he was appointed to by former President Bill Clinton. Andrew had come out behind Hillary Clinton's candidacy when she announced in 2007, and he explained that his defection to Obama was an attempt to end the protracted primary fight. He said that the Democrats were helping presumptive Republican nominee John McCain, and "doing his [McCain's] work for him."<ref>[http://apnews.myway.com/article/20080501/D90CQURG0.html DNC chairman under Bill Clinton: Unite behind Obama] Associated Press, May 1, 2008</ref>

In particular, the possibility of one candidate gaining more pledged delegates from primary and caucus wins, but losing the nomination to the other due to the decisions of superdelegates, made some Democratic leaders uncomfortable.{{Fact|date=December 2008}} The Clinton camp, behind in pledged delegates, advocated that superdelegates exercise their own judgment in deciding which candidate to back, while the Obama camp, ahead in pledged delegates, advocated that superdelegates follow the will of the voters and back whichever candidate had the most pledged delegates.<ref name="wapo021708">{{cite news | url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/02/16/AR2008021602657.html?hpid=topnews | title=Clinton, Obama Dispute Roles of Superdelegates | author=Peter Slevin, Jose Antonio Vargas | publisher=''[[The Washington Post]]'' | date=2008-02-17 | accessdate=2008-02-17}}</ref> Some party leaders, such as [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives|Speaker of the House]] [[Nancy Pelosi]], argued for the latter interpretation,<ref name="bsun021608">{{cite news | url=http://weblogs.baltimoresun.com/news/politics/blog/2008/02/hillary_clinton_campaign_defen.html | title=Hillary Clinton camp defends superdelegate clout | author=Rick Pearson | publisher=''[[The Baltimore Sun]]'' | date=2008-02-16 | accessdate=2008-02-17}}</ref> while others such as [[Democratic National Committee]] chair [[Howard Dean]] argued for the former.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://tpmelectioncentral.talkingpointsmemo.com/2008/02/howard_dean_speaks_out_about_r.php | title=Howard Dean On Super-Delegates: "Their role is to exercise their best judgment" | author=Greg Sargent | publisher=[[TPM Election Central]] | date=2008-02-16 | accessdate=2008-02-17}}</ref> Dean also said party leaders would not force a deal, but "let the voters vote."<ref>{{cite news |first=Jake |last=Tapper |authorlink=Jake Tapper |title=Howard Dean: Voters, Not Superdelegates, Will Decide |url=http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/Vote2008/story?id=4396023&page=1 |work=[[ABC News]] |date=2008-03-06 |accessdate=2008-03-28 }}</ref>

African American superdelegates previously pledged to Clinton, found themselves under pressure to switch to supporting Obama's candidacy; one example being [[John Lewis (politician)|John Lewis]], a noted [[African-American Civil Rights Movement (1955-1968)|civil rights]] leader, [[Selma March|Selma marcher]], US Representative from Georgia, and superdelegate, who formally switched endorsements to Obama on [[February 27]] [[2008]];<ref>{{cite web|accessdate=|url=http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2008/02/27/lewis-switches-from-clinton-to-obama/|date=February 27, 2008|title=Lewis switches from Clinton to Obama|work=CNN Political Ticker}}</ref> Representative [[Jesse Jackson, Jr.]] suggested that those staying with Clinton might face Democratic primary challenges in the future.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.time.com/time/printout/0,8816,1713596,00.html | title=Black Lawmakers Rethink Clinton Support | author=David Espo | publisher=[[Associated Press]] | date=2008-02-14 | accessdate=2008-02-17}}</ref> [[MoveOn.org]] started an Internet petition to urge superdelegates to "let the voters decide between Clinton and Obama, then support the people's choice."<ref>{{cite news | url=http://thecaucus.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/02/14/moveon-to-superdelegates-wait/ | title=MoveOn to Superdelegates: Wait! | author=Sarah Wheaton | publisher=''[[The New York Times]]'' | date=2008-02-14 | accessdate=2008-02-17}}</ref><ref name="bsun021608"/>

Speculation that Barack Obama had amassed about fifty additional superdelegates, removing Clinton's final advantage in the race, was reported on the eve of the [[March 4]] primaries and caucuses; with the Clinton victory in most of that night's contests, the Obama camp chose not to release those names as expected the following day.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/21134540/vp/23507892#23507892|title=Hardball 3/6|work=[[MSNBC.com]]|accessdate=2008-03-06}}</ref>

After Obama's large victory in North Carolina and close second in Indiana on May 6, he took the lead in committed superdelegates. The results in those two states made Obama the clear front-runner for the nomination, and he picked up endorsements from 26 superdelegates in the week following those primaries.<ref name=autogenerated1 /><ref>[http://www.nytimes.com/2008/05/10/us/politics/09cnd-campaign.html?_r=1&hp&oref=slogin Obama Pulls Ahead of Clinton in Superdelegates] NY Times, May 9, 2008</ref><ref>[http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5iFR0r8H6W8nb59poWNJ7qF8YApEgD90KABF80 Superdelegates put Obama within mathematical reach] Associated Press, May 12, 2008</ref>

==Controversies, allegations, and scandals during the primary campaign==
===Obama's childhood and heritage===
Various criticisms were made during the campaign concerning Obama's religious background and heritage, both by political opponents and by some members of the media.<ref name=smear>{{cite news | first=Christopher | last=Hayes | authorlink=Christopher Hayes (journalist)| title=The new right-wing smear machine | date=[[November 12]] [[2007]] | url=http://www.thenation.com/doc/20071112/hayes/5 | work=Nation | accessdate=2007-12-15}}</ref> 

====Viral email====
In 2004, conservative columnist [[Andy Martin (U.S. politician)|Andy Martin]] issued a press release alleging that Obama had "sought to misrepresent his heritage,"<ref>{{cite web | url=http://biz.yahoo.com/prnews/040810/nytu167_1.html??printer=1 | title=Columnist Says Barack Obama 'Lied To The American People;' Asks Publisher to Withdraw Obama's Book] |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20040916062323/http://biz.yahoo.com/prnews/040810/nytu167_1.html??printer=1 | archivedate=2004-09-16 | author=Andy Martin Worldwide Communications | publisher=Yahoo!Finance |date=[[August 11]], [[2004]] | accessdate=2008-03-24}}</ref> indirectly triggering one of the first [[viral email]]s spreading false rumors about Obama's background.<ref>Mosk, Matthew, "An Attack That Came Out of the Ether," Washington Post, 28 June 2008.

The issue lay fallow for almost three years, but picked up again in late 2006, as the announcement of Obama's presidential candidacy approached. In October, a conservative blog, Infidel Bloggers Alliance, reposted Martin's press release in response to a question about Obama's heritage.<ref>[http://ibloga.blogspot.com/2006/10/is-barack-obama-lying-about-his-life.html Infidel Bloggers Alliance: Is Barack Obama Lying About His Life Story?<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>  Then, on December 26, conservative activist Ted Sampley, co-founder of Vietnam Veterans Against [[John Kerry]], posted a column suggesting Obama was a secret Muslim, heavily quoting Martin's original press release.<ref>[http://www.usvetdsp.com/dec06/obama_muslim.htm Barak Hussein Obama - Who is he?<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Shortly afterward, many chain [[e-mail]]s began circulating claiming that Obama was a hypothetical "[[Manchurian Candidate]]."<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/16/magazine/16wwln-idealab-t.html | title=Rumor<U+2019>s Reasons | work=The New York Times | author=Farhad Manjoo | date=[[March 16]] [[2008]] | accessdate=2008-03-23}}</ref>  According to Hayes, one of these emails was forwarded to [[Snopes]] within hours of Sampley's story. Hayes believes that the email was likely a slightly altered version of the Sampley article, which was in turn heavily based on Martin's 2004 press release. Martin told Hayes that he got numerous calls once the emails began circulating. When the callers asked him if he wrote the release, Martin replied, "They are all my children."<ref name=smear/>
 
In January 2007, two of the Obama campaign's first hires were opposition researchers, immediately assigned to debunk these e-mails.<ref>{{cite news | author=Ben Smith and Carrie Budoff Brown| title=E-mail smear taxes Obama campaign | date=January 26 2008 | url=http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0108/8109.html | work=Politico | accessdate=2008-01-24}} See also: {{cite web |url=http://www.snopes.com/politics/obama/muslim.asp |title=Who Is Barack Obama? |accessdate=2008-03-28 |work=[[Snopes]] }}</ref>

====False allegations====
On January 17, 2007, the day after Obama announced his candidacy, the Internet magazine ''[[Insight (magazine)|Insight]]'' published an article claiming that Clinton campaign staff had told them that Obama had attended a Muslim seminary as a child in Indonesia and that they were planning to use that information against him during the upcoming [[primary election]] campaign.<ref>[http://www.insightmag.com/Media/MediaManager/Obama_1.htm Hillary's team has questions about Obama's Muslim background] ''Insight'' January 11, 2007.</ref> The Clinton and Obama campaigns quickly denounced the allegations.<ref>{{cite news | first=Jake | last=Tapper | title=Nothing Extreme About Indonesian School Attended by Obama | date=[[January 25]] [[2007]] | url=http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/print?id=2822061 | work =ABC News | accessdate=2007-12-05}}</ref> Investigations by [[CNN]], [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] and others showed that Obama had not, as ''Insight'' had written, attended an Islamic seminary. Instead, for his first three years abroad Obama attended St. Francis Assisi Catholic School, and in his last year transferred to [[State Elementary School Menteng 01|State Elementary School Menteng Besuki<U+200E>]], an [[Education in Indonesia|Indonesian public school]] for children of all faiths.<ref>{{cite news | first=Prodita | last=Sabarini | title=Impish Obama couldn't sit still, says school pal | date=[[January 31]] [[2007]] | url=http://www.asiamedia.ucla.edu/article-southeastasia.asp?parentid=62743 | work=The Jakarta Post(reprinted by AsiaMedia) | accessdate=2008-02-11}}</ref> A series of ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' reports found that "[w]hen Obama attended 4th grade in 1971, Muslim children spent two hours a week studying Islam, and Christian children spent those two hours learning about the Christian religion."<ref name=distorted>{{cite news

In February 2008, a photo of Obama dressed in a turban and other local clothing while on a 2006 visit to an [[Somali people|ethnic Somali]] community in Kenya appeared on the [[Drudge Report]], which attributed it to a Clinton staffer upset at Obama getting more favorable coverage in the media than Clinton. The photo was interpreted as suggesting Muslim garb, and the Obama campaign accused the Clinton campaign of <U+201C>shameful, offensive fear-mongering<U+201D>. A spokesman for Clinton replied that the release of the photo had not been sanctioned by the campaign <U+2014> but added that "We have over 700 people on this campaign and I<U+2019>m not in a position to know what each one of them may or may not have done."<ref name=DM>

E-mails and [[Flyer (pamphlet)|flyers]] repeating allegations about Obama and other candidates were distributed to voters in [[Iowa]] and [[South Carolina]] just before they went to vote for presidential candidates.

Another accusation is that Obama refuses to say the [[Pledge of Allegiance]]. This is based on a ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine picture of Obama listening to the U.S. National Anthem with his hands at his sides while the others on stage have their right hands over their hearts. He does, in fact, say the Pledge and sometimes leads the Senate in doing so.<ref>[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/us_and_americas/us_elections/article3194740.ece Barack Obama: I'm no Muslim] Times Online, 01-16-2008 See also: [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ACNJMg6ZHu8 Obama Recites Pledge of Allegiance before Senate on 2/1/07]; [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iC9veEouqqQ Obama Recites Pledge of Allegiance before Senate on 6/21/07].</ref>

The story gained headlines again in late April with several public appearances by Rev. Wright. He appeared on the [[Bill Moyers]] show on PBS on April 25, spoke to the [[NAACP]] in Detroit on April 27 and addressed the media before a symposium at the [[National Press Club]] on April 28.<ref>[http://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/29/us/politics/29watc.html?sq=obama%20wright&st=nyt&adxnnl=1&scp=7&adxnnlx=1209499414-4Xbo3Xf0nnHDjKuTi5ycgA Not Speaking for Obama, Pastor Speaks for Himself, at Length] NY Times, April 29, 2008</ref> In Detroit, Wright "also defended Obama and lashed out at the news media for running excerpts of his heated sermons, media pundits and those who have tried to connect him to Islam because of his full name <U+2014> Barack Hussein Obama."<ref>[http://elections.foxnews.com/2008/04/27/wright-discusses-public-crucifixion-at-sunday-services/ Rev.

===Other controversies===
====NAFTA controversy====
In February 2008, a Canadian diplomatic memo<ref>{{cite web
|url=http://abcnews.go.com/images/Politics/Canwest%20News_1.pdf
|format=PDF|title=Leaked Memo
|publisher=ABC News
|accessdate=2008-02-08

}}</ref> surfaced, which alleged that [[Barack Obama]]'s economic advisor [[Austan Goolsbee]] had met with Canadian consular officials in Chicago and told them to disregard Obama's campaign rhetoric regarding the [[North American Free Trade Agreement]] (NAFTA), a charge the Obama campaign later denied.

[[Ian Brodie]] (Chief of Staff in [[Stephen Harper]]'s Prime Minister's Office), during the media lockup for the [[February 26]], [[2008]] [[Canadian federal budget|budget]], stopped to chat with several journalists, and was surrounded by a group from [[CTV Television Network|CTV]]. The conversation turned to the pledges to renegotiate the North American free-trade agreement made by the two Democratic contenders, Obama and New York Senator [[Hillary Clinton]]. Brodie, apparently seeking to play down the potential impact on Canada, told the reporters the threat was not serious, and that someone from Clinton's campaign had even contacted Canadian diplomats to tell them not to worry because the NAFTA threats were mostly political posturing. The [[Canadian Press]] news agency quoted that source as saying that Brodie said that someone from Clinton's campaign called and was "telling the embassy to take it with a grain of salt."<ref name=globe-2008-03-06>{{cite web

</ref> The Clinton campaign denies it. "We flatly deny the report," says Clinton spokesperson Phil Singer. "We did not sanction nor would we ever sanction anyone to say any such a thing. We give the Canadian government blanket immunity to reveal the name of anyone in the Clinton campaign think they heard from."<ref>

The story was followed by CTV's Washington bureau chief, [[Tom Clark]], who reported that the Obama campaign, not the Clinton's, had reassured Canadian diplomats. Clark cited unnamed Canadian sources in his initial report. Media later reported the source as Canadian Ambassador [[Michael Wilson (politician)|Michael Wilson]]. There was no explanation at the time for why Brodie was said to have referred to the Clinton campaign but the news report was about the Obama campaign. [[Robert Hurst]], president of CTV News, declined to comment.<ref name=globe-2008-03-06/>

The Prime Minister's communications director, Sandra Buckler, has said that Brodie "does not recall" discussing the issue. On [[March 4]], [[2008]] Harper initially denied that Brodie was a source of the leak <U+2014> but he appeared to be referring to a diplomatic memo that described the key conversation between an adviser to Obama and Canada's consul-general in Chicago, Georges Rioux. Harper did not appear to be distinguishing between the two leaks later in the day. Harper asked the top civil servant, Clerk of the Privy Council [[Kevin G. Lynch|Kevin Lynch]], to call in an internal security team, with the help of [[Foreign Affairs Canada|Foreign Affairs]]. Members of the opposition asserted that an internal inquiry is unlikely to look seriously at Harper's own high-level political aides and appointees, such as Brodie or Wilson, Canada's ambassador to Washington.<ref name=globe-2008-03-06/>

On [[March 10]], [[2008]] Canadian MP [[Navdeep Bains]] called on Canadian Ambassador to the United States [[Michael Wilson (politician)|Michael Wilson]] to step down as Canada's ambassador to Washington while the leaks that are investigated. Wilson has publicly acknowledged that he spoke to CTV reporter [[Tom Clark]] who first reported the leaks before the story aired, but refused to discuss what was said.<ref>

====Passport issues====
There have been three separate incidents involving Barack Obama's [[United States State Department|State Department]] passport file since 2008 began; while the instances of unauthorized access have occurred over a three-month span, Obama was notified only on [[March 20]], as upper levels of the State Department themselves, first became aware of the breaches.<ref> {{cite web | url = http://www.cnn.com/2008/POLITICS/03/20/obama.passport/index.html | title = Three wrongly viewed Obama's passport file | work = CNN.com | accessdate = 2008-03-20}}</ref>On [[March 21]] [[2008]], the [[United States Department of State]] revealed that Obama's passport file was improperly accessed three times in 2008. Three contract employees are accused in the wrongdoing. One, who works for [[The Analysis Corporation]] (TAC), accessed Obama and McCain's records, and was disciplined. The two other workers, who worked for [[Stanley Inc]]., each accessed Obama's file on separate occasions and were fired. An unauthorized access of Hillary Clinton's file was also made in mid-2007, but was considered a training error and unrelated to the other instances.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.cnn.com/2008/POLITICS/03/21/obama.passport/index.html | title = Obama urges inquiry into passport snooping | work = CNN.com | accessdate = 2008-03-23}}</ref> [[John O.

===Viral videos===
The Obama primary campaign has received publicity from the introduction of several high-profile [[music videos]] concerning the senator. The first was an off-topic parody song portraying a fictional love between Senator Obama and a provocatively-dressed young woman nicknamed "Obama Girl," entitled ''[[I Got a Crush... on Obama]],'' first appearing on [[June 13]], [[2007]]. The second video was ''[[Yes We Can]]'', after the ubiquitous Obama campaign slogan, itself originally a long-standing [[labor union|union]] chant in the US. It was released on [[February 2]], [[2008]], and was a straightforward, star-studded endorsement by a range of actors, musicians and other celebrities, led by [[Grammy]]-winner [[Will.i.am]] of the [[Black-Eyed Peas]], singing the actual words of an Obama speech following the New Hampshire primary.<ref name="nyt0327">{{cite news |first=Brian |last=Stelter |authorlink=Brian Stelter |title=Finding Political News Online, the Young Pass It On |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/27/us/politics/27voters.html?_r=2&hp=&adxnnl=1&oref=slogin&adxnnlx=1206666163-YpoMNe/u2DIXJ6Q+JgPlLQ |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=2008-03-27 |accessdate=2008-03-28 }}</ref> The video was generating over a million views on YouTube a day following its release.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/arts/main.jhtml?xml=/arts/2008/02/16/bmobama116.xml&DCMP=ILC-traffdrv07053100 | title=Barack Obama's 'Yes We Can' video | work=The Daily Telegraph | date=2008-02-14 | accessdate=2008-02-28}}</ref> By [[March 27]], [[2008]], the song had been viewed over 17 million times on YouTube and other sites.<ref name="nyt0327" />

==Political positions==
{{main|Political positions of Barack Obama}}

Presidential candidate and Senator [[Barack Obama]] has taken positions on many national, political, economic and social issues, either through public comments or his senatorial voting record.

One such position is Obama's stance on health care. Obama has repeatedly said that he wants to see that every American has the option of having affordable health care as good as every U. S. Senator has. He has proposed a major overhaul of the nation<U+2019>s health care system, aimed at covering the nearly 45 million uninsured Americans, reducing premium costs for everyone else, and breaking what he asserted was <U+201C>the stranglehold<U+201D> that the biggest drug and insurance companies have on the health care market.<ref>[[Robin Toner|Toner, Robin]] (May 29, 2007).
