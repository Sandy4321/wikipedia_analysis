'''''Guitar Solos''''' is the debut [[solo album]] of English [[guitarist]], [[composer]] and [[Improvisation|improviser]] [[Fred Frith]]. It was recorded while Frith was still a member of the English [[experimental rock]] [[Musical ensemble|group]] [[Henry Cow]] (1968<U+2013>1978) and was released in the United Kingdom on [[Gramophone record|LP record]] by [[Caroline Records]] in October 1974. The album comprises eight tracks of unaccompanied and [[Musical improvisation|improvised]] [[experimental rock]] music played on [[prepared guitar]]s by Frith without any [[overdubbing]].

''Guitar Solos'' was voted one of the [[1974 NME Critics End of Year Poll|best albums of 1974]] by ''[[NME]]'' critics. [[Allmusic]] called it a landmark album because of its innovative and experimental approach to guitar playing. It also attracted the attention of [[Brian Eno]], resulting in Frith's playing guitar on two of Eno's albums, and spawned two follow-up albums, ''[[Guitar Solos 2]]'' (1976) and ''[[Guitar Solos 3]]'' (1979). ''Guitar Solos'' was [[remaster]]ed and released on [[Compact Disc|CD]] on Frith's own record label, [[Fred Records]] in 2002.

==Background==
Fred Frith was a [[Classical music|classically]]-trained [[violin]]ist who turned to playing [[blues]] guitar while still at school.<ref name=downbeat-p23/> In 1967 he went to [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge University]] where he and fellow student, [[Tim Hodgkinson]] formed [[Henry Cow]].<ref>{{Citation|url=http://calyx.perso.neuf.fr/bands/henrycow.html|title=Henry Cow|work=Calyx - The Canterbury Music Website|accessdate=13 February 2009}}</ref> While at University, Frith read [[John Cage]]'s ''[[Silence: Lectures and Writings]]'', which changed his attitude to music completely. He realised that "sound, in and of itself, can be as important as [...] melody and harmony and rhythm."<ref name=downbeat-p23>{{Harv|Milkowski|1983|p= 23}}</ref> This changed his approach to the guitar, "just to see what I could get out of it" and initiated a long period of experimentation that continued throughout Frith's musical career.<ref name=downbeat-p23/>

While the music of Henry Cow was highly orchestrated and structured, Frith also began to experiment with unstructured music, using [[Prepared guitar#Custom made instruments|prepared instruments]] and [[Aleatoric music|chance composition]].<ref name=downbeat-p24/> In June 1974, after the release of Henry Cow's second album, [[Virgin Records]] (Henry Cow's record label) commissioned a solo record from Frith.<ref name=downbeat-p24/><ref name=Comer/> They were impressed with his musical ability and gave him free rein to record whatever he wanted.<ref name=downbeat-p24/> In a 2001 radio interview, Frith said he used the opportunity as a challenge: "I said to myself [...] in two weeks time I'm going to go into the studio and I have no idea what I'm going to do and I'm going to kind of reinvent the instrument for myself."<ref name=Comer/> Frith spent four days in July 1974 recording at the Kaleidophon Studios in [[London]],<ref name=sleevenotes>{{cite album-notes |title=Guitar Solos |bandname=Fred Frith |year=1974 |format=Vinyl back cover |publisher=[[Caroline Records]] |publisherid=C 1508 |location=London |mbid=ad7885eb-6081-471c-8d9d-0a66a9e82fd6}}</ref> and the resulting experimentation and the process of galvanisation and pressure led to the "radical approach to the guitar" on the album.<ref name=Comer/> In October 1974, Virgin released the album as ''Guitar Solos'' on their budget label, [[Caroline Records]].

==Recording==
Frith recorded the album at [[White Noise (band)|David Vorhaus]]'s Kaleidophon Studios in London on 11<U+2013>13 and 15 July 1974, where he played a modified 1936 Gibson K-11. He added an extra [[Pickup (music technology)|pickup]] over the strings at the [[Nut (string instrument)|nut]], enabling him to amplify sound from both sides of the [[fret]]ted note. He then split the [[Fingerboard|fretboard]] in two with a [[capo]], effectively giving him two guitars, each amplified separately that he could play independently with each hand. To split the sounds further he attached [[Crocodile clip|alligator clips]] at various positions on the strings. The net result was a guitar with multiple sound sources that could be channelled to a [[Mixing console|mixer]] and distributed across the [[Stereophonic sound|stereo]] [[soundscape]].<ref name=downbeat-p24>{{Harv|Milkowski|1983|p= 24}}</ref>

The album was recorded in four days without any [[overdubbing]]. All the pieces were improvised, some completely, some to a roughly preconceived idea, and sound as they were played, except for "No Birds", which was recorded in two parts, and "Not Forgotten", from which two notes were removed. The only sounds not produced 'naturally' by guitar are those of a [[Distortion (music)|fuzzbox]] used on "Out of Their Heads (On Locoweed)", "Heat c/w Moment" and "No Birds", an [[Delay (audio effect)|echo delay]] used on "No Birds", and ambient noise from Frith's breath and feet on "Heat c/w Moment".<ref name=sleevenotes/>

|description=30 second sample of "No Birds" illustrating Frith's [[prepared guitar]] with multiple sound sources.<small><ref name=downbeat-p24/></small>
|format=[[Ogg]]}}

On the longest track on the album, "No Birds", Frith played on two prepared guitars simultaneously, creating the [[timbre]] and [[Range (music)|range]] of an orchestra. He laid the two guitars flat on a table, [[Neck (music)|neck]] to neck with the [[Solid body|bodies]] of the guitars at opposite ends and the necks parallel to each other. He tuned the strings on both guitars to one note, and because they were stereo guitars with nut pickups, he had six separate sound sources coming from each guitar. Using [[Expression pedal|volume pedals]] on some of the sound sources, he filtered sounds in and out of the mix without doing anything on the guitars.<ref name=downbeat-p24/>

''Guitar Solos'' was voted one of the [[1974 NME Critics End of Year Poll|best albums of 1974]] by ''[[NME]]'' critics.<ref name=NME> {{Citation |url=http://www.rocklistmusic.co.uk/1974.html |title=NME Albums 1974 |work=Rocklist.net |accessdate=16 February 2009}} </ref>  Sean Westergaard of [[Allmusic]] called ''Guitar Solos'' a landmark album because of its innovative and experimental approach to guitar playing.<ref name=amg>{{Citation |url={{Allmusic|class=album|id=r637538|pure_url=yes}} |title=Guitar Solos |work=AllMusic.com |first=Sean |last=Westergaard |accessdate=7 January 2009}} </ref> Radio journalist Chris Comer said it was a "ground breaking guitar improvisation record."<ref name=Comer> {{Citation |url=http://www.chriscomerradio.com/fred_frith/frith9-30-01.htm |title=Fred Frith "Clearing" Guitar Solo Interview, September 2001 |work=Chris Comer Radio Interviews |first=Chris |last=Comer |accessdate=18 February 2009}} </ref> In the January 1983 edition of ''[[Down Beat]]'' magazine, Bill Milkowski wrote that on ''Guitar Solos'' "Frith unveiled a haunting collection of improvised music on prepared guitar which must have stunned listeners of the day. Even today that album stands up as uniquely innovative and undeniably daring."<ref name=downbeat-p24/> The album also attracted the attention of [[Brian Eno]] who was "excited by the timbral possibilities that [Frith had] been discovering."<ref name=His-Voice> {{Citation |last=J<U+00F3>nsson |first=Darrell |date=January 2007 |url=http://www.hisvoice.cz/his_voice/archiv_casopisu/2007/his_voice_1_2007/fred_frith |title=Fred Frith |work=His Voice |accessdate=20 September 2010}}</ref> Eno asked Frith to record with him, and this resulted in Frith playing guitar on two of Eno's albums, ''[[Before and After Science]]'' (1977) and ''[[Music for Films]]'' (1978).<ref name=His-Voice/>

The table-top guitar setup Frith used on this album became a standard for many of his subsequent live solo performances, including those recorded on his 1982 live double album ''[[Live in Japan (Fred Frith album)|Live in Japan]]''. He later extended his technique to include "[[found object]]s", which he used on his guitars to extract new sounds.<ref name=downbeat-p25>{{Harv|Milkowski|1983|p= 25}}</ref>

The success of ''Guitar Solos'' spawned two follow-up albums, ''[[Guitar Solos 2]]'' (1976) and ''[[Guitar Solos 3]]'' (1979), which featured Frith and other improvising guitarists, including [[Derek Bailey]] and [[Hans Reichel]].<ref name=downbeat-p25/> Frith coordinated and produced these albums, and employed many of the same "unorthodox techniques" he had used on ''Guitar Solos''.<ref name=downbeat-p25/> When a [[remaster]]ed edition of the original ''Guitar Solos'' was released 28 years later on Frith's own [[Fred Records]] label,<ref name=FR-CD-notes>{{cite album-notes |title=Guitar Solos |bandname=Fred Frith |year=2002 |format=CD liner |publisher=[[Fred Records]] |location=London}}</ref> it attracted further praise from critics. Westergaard wrote that "''Guitar Solos''' lasting legacy is that it radically redefined the way some people think about the guitar."<ref name=amg/>
