The song's meaning originated with a discussion between [[Brandon Heath]] and friend and songwriter Jason Ingram. "We had a conversation over Chinese food that we wished we could have God<U+2019>s perspective on things", Heath said. "If we did have His perspective, we'd wish we could have it for long periods of time, rather than just for a few seconds. That was the beginning."<ref name="700club">{{cite web |url=http://www.cbn.com/700club/guests/bios/brandon_heath031209.aspx |title=Brandon Heath: 'Give Me Your Eyes' |author=Terri Simmons |work=[[The 700 Club]] |date=2009-03-12 |accessdate=2009-04-03}}</ref> He soon began to pen a song about the idea, co-writing "Give Me Your Eyes" with Ingram.<ref name="story">{{cite web |url=http://www.ccmmagazine.com/just_for_you/story_behind_the_song/11581815/brandon%20heath/ |title=STORY BEHIND THE SONG: Brandon Heath<U+2019>s "Give Me Your Eyes" |work=[[CCM Magazine]] |accessdate=2008-10-22 |date=September 2008 |author=Brandon Heath}}</ref> Prior to recording ''[[What If We]]'', Heath had written 40 possible tracks for the album,<ref name="CT interview">{{cite web |url=http://www.christianitytoday.com/music/interviews/2008/brandonheath-mini-0808.html |title=Brandon Heath, 08/08 |work=[[Christianity Today]] |date=2008-08-25 |accessdate=2008-10-22}}</ref> and although the song wasn't his top favorite, he noted that "Give Me Your Eyes" was "one of the first that really stuck out."<ref name="story" /><ref name="CT interview" />

In the last chorus, a few of the previous scenes are replayed as Heath now helps with people's individual situations. In one of the early shots, a woman steps in front of an approaching car; it is replayed as Heath intervenes and stops her from being hit by the car.
