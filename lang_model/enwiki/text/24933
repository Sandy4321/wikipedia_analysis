===Military career===
[[Image:Col McAlpin.JPG|thumb | left | Colonel E.A. McAlpin, commander of the 71st Regiment, New York National Guard]]
General McAlpin was born on June 9. 1848, the son of [[David Hunter McAlpin]], a prominent owner of a tobacco manufacturer in [[New York City]], and Adelaide Rose McAlpin, in Ossining, New York. McAlpin attended public school for a time, then graduated from [[Phillips Academy]] in Andover Massachusetts in 1861. Following his graduation, McAlpin joined his father<U+2019>s company, D. H. McAlpin & Co. With the outbreak of hostilities, McAlpin enlisted in the Civil War as a drummer boy but his father rescinded the action due to his youth at age 17<ref>{{cite book

After the end of the war he was old enough to enlist in his own right and in 1869 joined the 7th Regiment of the [[New York Militia]], (later the New York Guard) with the rank of Private.

In 1874 McAlpin attained the rank of First Lieutenant in the [[71st Infantry Regiment (New York)]] where he was promoted in 1885 to Colonel a roll he retained until his military retirement in 1887. McAlpin had inherited a disorganized and dispirited regiment which was in danger of being disbanded by the State of New York. He aggressively cut dead wood from the ranks and reorganized the officer ranks to the extent that the "Army and Navy Journal" called it on 18 July, 1885 "...virtually a new regiment, so much has its personnel changed during the past six months..."<ref>{{cite book

McAlpin, the but recently elected commander, has certainly developed energy, pluck and good sense in the management of his organization, which has, in turn, been followed by most encouraging results..."<ref>Ibid p 454</ref>

After retiring from the service he was appointed Adjutant General of the State by Governor [[Levi P. Morton]], in 1895 with the rank of Major General. In this role he deployed his units to suppress several disorders in the New York City vicinity, but saw no formal combat.

===Personal life===
On 27 October 1870 he married Anne Brandreth, daughter of [[Benjamin Brandreth]] proprietor of the then-famous <U+201C>Brandreth Vegetable Universal Pills<U+201D> from which he amassed a large fortune. The wedding took place at Trinity Episcopal Church in Ossining and was officiated by Rev. Clarence Buel. Also in that year he was admitted as a partner in his father's firm, the D.H. McAlpin & Co tobacco company. 

[[Image:Hillside House.JPG|thumb | left | The McAlpin home in Ossining, NY]] In 1895 the couple celebrated their silver wedding anniversary at their house in Ossining, NY, dubbed <U+201C>Hillside House<U+201D>. As befitted a prominent person in the day, the couple chartered a train to bring guests from New York City and return them at the end of the evening. <ref>{{cite news
