'''Aslan''', the "Great Lion," is the main character in ''[[The Chronicles of Narnia]]'', a series of seven fantasy novels for children written by [[C. S. Lewis]]. He appears in all seven books of the series. The word ''aslan'' is [[Turkish Language|Turkish]] for "[[lion]]" and is used as a title for [[Ottoman Dynasty|Ottoman/]][[Seljukids|Seljukid]] and [[Persian Empire]] (Turkish) rulers.  The theory that the figure of Aslan may have been inspired by a mysterious lion which  appears and disappears suddenly at key moments in the novel [[The Place of the Lion]], written by Lewis' close friend [[Charles Williams]], was specifically denied by Lewis in a paper published later in his life.{{fact}}

Throughout the series, it is often repeated that Aslan is "not a tame lion", since, despite his gentle and loving nature, he is powerful and can be dangerous. He takes the role of a [[Christ|Christ-like]] figure, though according to Lewis he is not an [[allegorical]] portrayal of Christ, but rather a different, hypothetical, [[incarnation]] of Christ himself: 'If Aslan represented the immaterial [[Deity]], he would be an allegorical figure. In reality however he is an invention giving an imaginary answer to the question, ''What might Christ become like if there really were a world like Narnia and He chose to be incarnate and die and rise again in that world as He actually has done in ours?' This is not allegory at all.'' This interpretation is related to [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]'s concept of "secondary creation" expounded in his 1947 essay ''[[On Fairy-Stories]]'', reflecting discussions Lewis and Tolkien had in the [[Inklings]] group. He has many followers, which include a plethora of Talking Beasts, Centaurs, Fauns, Dryads, Red Dwarfs, Satyrs, Naiads, Hamadryads, Silvans, Unicorns, and Winged Horses. When refering to Aslan with a pronoun, Lewis often [[capitalization|capitalises]] the word, to convey the reverence the characters feel towards him.

==Biography==
{{spoiler}}
===In ''The Magician's Nephew''===

(This is the first story in the chronology of Narnia, and of its human visitors, but the sixth tale Lewis wrote, and for many readers it is not the first meeting with the character.)

Aslan makes his first appearance at the creation of [[Narnia]]. When [[Digory Kirke|Digory]], [[Polly Plummer|Polly]], [[White Witch|Jadis]], [[Uncle Andrew]], [[King Frank|Frank]], and [[Fledge (Narnia)|Strawberry]] inadvertantly enter a new world using [[magic ring]]s. They find it an empty void. Aslan appears, and through the power of his singing, calls the world of Narnia into existence. 

While all the characters immediately feel awe for Aslan, Jadis expresses this as fear and hatred, and unsuccessfully assaults Aslan with an iron bar before fleeing. Aslan is unperturbed, and continues calling plants and animals into existence. The power of his song is so great that even the iron bar, dropped on fertile earth, grows into a functioning [[lamp-post (Narnia)|lamp-post]], and toffees sprout into fruit trees.

Aslan then chooses certain animals, a couple from each species, and gives them the power of speech and reason. He instructs them to look after the dumb animals. He appoints Frank to be King of Narnia, and brings his wife Helen to Narnia from Earth to be Queen.

Aslan explains that Jadis will pose a great threat to the Narnians, and charges Digory and Polly with a quest to acquire a magic fruit to protect the land. He turns the horse Strawberry into a [[winged horse]]. When the quest is complete, he crowns Frank and Helen, and advises Digory on how to care for his sick mother.

At the end of the novel, he takes Digory, Polly and Uncle Andrew back to the [[Wood between the Worlds]], without the use of magic rings, and warns them that their Earth is in danger of a similar fate to the dead world [[Charn]].

===In ''The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe''===

(This is the second Narnia story chronologically, but the first one Lewis wrote, and for many readers was the first appearance of Aslan.)

With Narnia in thrall to the [[White Witch]] and her unending winter, all the Narnians are eagerly anticipating the return of Aslan. 'Aslan is coming' is repeated, in fearful secrecy, as a message of hope. The Witch turns those who say this in her presence into stone. The Narnians expect Aslan to bring an end to the White Witch's tyrranical reign. 

The four human children are led to Aslan, but before they set off [[Edmund Pevensie|Edmund]] leaves to betray them to the White Witch. The children find Aslan leading a large gathering of Narnians who are preparing for war. Aslan sends [[Peter Pevensie|Peter]] and some other Narnians to attack the Witch and her small entourage, during which they rescue Edmund. Aslan makes Peter a knight.

The White Witch reappears and claims from Aslan the right to execute Edmund as a traitor, due to Deep Magic from the Dawn of Time. Aslan offers that the Witch might execute him in Edmund's place, and she accepts. On the [[Stone Table]], as [[Susan Pevensie|Susan]] and [[Lucy Pevensie|Lucy]] watch, the White Witch mocks, abuses, and finally slays Aslan with a knife.

After the Witch leaves with her army to attack the Narnians, Lucy, Susan, and a number of mice remove the bonds from Aslan's body. But as dawn breaks they find that his body is gone, and then Aslan reveals that he is alive once more. 

Aslan goes to the Witch's palace, and breaths on the statues of her petrified enemies, bringing them back to life. He leads them all to aid Peter, Edmund and the Narnian army who are fighting the Witch's army. At the conclusion of the battle, he leaps on top of the witch and destroys her.

Aslan crowns the four children as Kings and Queens of Narnia, and then disappears.

===In ''The Horse and his Boy''===

Aslan is a hidden influence on the life of [[Shasta (Narnia)|Prince Cor]] of [[Archenland]], helping him evade capture by his enemies, and giving him the resolve to persevere and help save Archenland and Narnia from an invading [[Calormene]] army. 

===In ''Prince Caspian''===

A thousand Narnian years after the events in "The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe", both Aslan and the Pevensie children have become near-forgotten myths. The children, newly returned to Narnia, find their faith tested as Aslan does not appear to them until they really try to see him.

[[Aslan's How]], a burial mound on the site of the Stone Table, is a gathering point for loyal Narnians, where Prince Caspian forms his army. Meanwhile, Aslan re-awakens the spirits of the forest and the river, leading a [[Bacchinalian]] revel though the oppressed towns and formenting a popular revolution.

When the [[Telmarine]]s are defeated, Aslan creates a door allowing them to return to Earth. He tells Peter and Susan that they are too old to return to Narnia.

===In ''Voyage of the Dawn Treader''===

While Prince Caspian is seeking seven lost mariners, the mouse [[Reepicheep]] hopes that their voyage will take them to [[Aslan's Country]] in the uttermost East.

On many of the islands where they stop, a brief glimpse of Aslan, or his image, is enough to guide Caspian and his crew away from dangerous folly. When the incalcitrant [[Eustace Scrubb|Eustace]] is turned into a [[dragon]], Aslan meets with him and pulls the dragon-skin away, leaving him as a human boy and a more pleasant person.

Eventually, Edmund, Lucy, Eustace and Reepicheep reach the world's end, where Aslan appears as a lamb, and shows Reepicheep the way to his country while helping the children return home. He also finally tells Edmund and Lucy they are too old to return to Narnia, as he had told Peter and Susan in ''Prince Caspian''.

===In ''The Silver Chair''===

Aslan instructs [[Jill Pole|Jill]] and Eustace to rescue [[Prince Rillian]], following a series of signs. 

He makes no further appearance until the end of the story, but his signs are central to the story, and belief in Aslan plays a crucial part in defeating the [[Lady in the Green Kirtle]], who tries to destroy the children's belief in Narnia.

===In ''The Last Battle''===
The ape [[Shift (Narnia)|Shift]] disguises the reluctant donkey [[Puzzle (Narnia)|Puzzle]] as Aslan. They fool the Narnians into thinking Aslan has returned, while issuing commands in his name.

The encroaching Calormenes are encouraged to treat Aslan and their god [[Tash]] as a singular being - [[Tashlan]]. Dissenters are thrown into Puzzle's stable, supposedly to meet Aslan/Tashlan, so that they can be murdered by Calormene soldiers.

The remaining loyal Narnians, and Jill and Poll, battle the Calormenes and their allies, but are forced through the stable door. They find themselves not in a stable, but in a [[paradise]] - Aslan's Country. Aslan is there, and they watch through the stable door as the world of Narnia is destroyed.

Aslan then commands Peter to shut the door on Narnia, and leads them through his country, which is a [[platonic ideal]] of Narnia. He greets a devout Tash-worshipping Calormene, saying that 'the good you did in Tash's name was really done for me, and the evil they did in my name was really done for Tash' {{cite-needed}}. As they get 'further in and higher up', the Narnians find Aslan's country getting bigger and better, eventually encompassing Earth as well.
