== Properties==
Nomex and related aramid polymers are related to [[nylon]], but have [[aromaticity|aromatic]] backbones, and hence are more rigid and more durable.  Nomex is the premier example of a ''[[meta- (chemistry)|meta]]'' variant of the [[aramid]]s ([[Kevlar]] is a ''[[para- (chemistry)|para]]'' aramid). Unlike Kevlar, Nomex cannot align during filament formation and has poorer strength.  It has excellent thermal, chemical, and radiation resistance. But Nomex is a meta-aramid, suitable for protection from fire; not a para-aramid, suitable for protection from bullets.

==Production==
The polymer is produced by [[Condensation polymer|condensation reaction]] from the [[monomer]]s [[m-phenylenediamine]] and [[Isophthalic acid|isophthaloyl chloride]].<ref name=Ullmann/>

It is sold in both fiber and sheet forms and is used as a fabric wherever resistance from heat and flame is required. Nomex sheet is actually a [[calender|calendered paper]] and made in a similar fashion. Nomex Type 410 paper is the original and one of the larger grade types made, mostly for [[Insulator (electrical)|electrical insulation]] purposes. Nomex fiber is made in the USA and in Spain (Asturias).

Wilfred Sweeny, the DuPont scientist responsible for discoveries leading to Nomex, earned a DuPont [[Lavoisier Medal]]<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.fibersource.com/f-info/More_News/dup-062102.htm |title=Nomex Scientist Earns Lavoisier Medal |publisher=FiberSource |date=June 20, 2002 |accessdate=2008-08-08}}</ref> partly for this work in 2002.

==Applications==
The paper is used in electrical laminates such as circuit boards and transformer cores as well as fireproof [[honeycomb structures]] where it is saturated with a [[phenolic resin]]. Honeycomb structures such as these, as well as [[mylar]]-Nomex laminates are used extensively in aircraft construction. Both the firefighting and vehicle racing industries use Nomex to create clothing and equipment that can withstand intense heat. 

A Nomex hood is a common piece of racing and [[fire fighting|firefighting]] equipment. It is placed on the [[human head|head]] on top of a [[firefighter]]'s [[face]] mask. The hood protects the portions of the head not covered by the [[helmet]] and face mask from the intense [[heat]] of the fire.
 
[[Race car driver]]s wear driving suits constructed of Nomex and or other [[List of fire-retardant materials|fire retardant materials]], along with Nomex gloves, long underwear, [[balaclava (clothing)|balaclavas]], socks, and shoes to protect them in the event of a [[fire]]. The [[FIA]] and the [http://www.sfifoundation.com SFI Foundation] provide specifications for flame-resistant drivers clothing to be used in racing. The standards range from single layer suits that provide some protection against flash fires to much thicker multi layer SFI-15 suits required by the [[NHRA|National Hot Rod Association]] that can protect a driver for up to 30 seconds against the intense heat and almost invisible flames generated by the [[nitromethane]], [[ethanol]] and [[methanol]] fuels that are used in championship [[drag racing]] (straight line acceleration contests).

[[Armed forces|Military]] [[aviator|pilots]] and aircrew wear flight suits made of over 92 percent Nomex to protect them from the possibility of [[Cockpit (aviation)|cockpit]] fires and other mishaps. Recently, troops riding in ground vehicles have also begun wearing Nomex. The remaining material is typically Kevlar thread used to hold the fabric together at the seams.

In the U.S. space program, Nomex has been used for the [[Thermal Micrometeoroid Garment]] on the [[Extravehicular Mobility Unit]] (in conjunction with [[Kevlar]] and [[Gore-Tex]]) and [[Advanced Crew Escape Suit|ACES]] pressure suit, both for fire and extreme environment (water immersion to near vacuum) protection, and as thermal blankets on the payload bay doors, fuselage, and upper wing surfaces of the [[Space Shuttle]] Orbiter. It has also been used for the airbags for the [[Mars Pathfinder]] and [[Mars Exploration Rover]] missions, the [[Galileo spacecraft|Galileo atmospheric probe]], the [[Cassini-Huygens]] [[Titan (moon)|Titan]] probe, as an external covering on the [[AERCam Sprint]], and is planned to be incorporated into NASA's upcoming [[Crew Exploration Vehicle]].

Nomex has also been used for its acoustic qualities, the first time being used in Troy, NY, at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute's Experimental Media and Performing Arts Center ([[EMPAC]]'s) main concert hall. A ceiling canopy of Nomex reflects high and mid frequency sound, providing reverberation, while letting lower frequency sound partially pass through the canopy.<ref>[http://www.fda-online.com/news_detail.php?id=89 Immersive Art: Surrounded by Science, Art Flourishes] by Michael Eddy, ''Stage Directions'', February 1, 2009</ref> According to RPI President Shirley Ann Jackson, EMPAC is the first venue in the world to use Nomex for acoustic reasons.

Nomex is also (like Kevlar) used in the production of [[loudspeaker]] drivers.

Honeycomb-structured Nomex paper is also used as a spacer between layers of lead in the [[ATLAS]] Liquid Argon Calorimeter.<ref>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/iel5/19/31498/01468561.pdf</ref>

== History ==
The death of race car drivers in fiery crashes, notably those of [[Fireball Roberts]] at Charlotte, and [[Eddie Sachs]] and [[Dave MacDonald]] at Indianapolis, all in 1964, meant something had to be done. <ref>''Competition Press'', June 27-July 10, 1964, Page 2.</ref> In early 1966 ''Competition Press and Autoweek'' reported: "During the past season, experimental driving suits were worn by [[Walt Hansgen]], [[Masten Gregory]], [[Marvin Panch]] and Group 44's Bob Tullius; these four representing a fairly good cross section in the sport. The goal was to get use-test information on the comfort and laundering characteristics of Nomex. The Chrysler-Plymouth team at the recent Motor Trend 500 at [[Riverside International Raceway|Riverside]] also wore these suits." <ref>''Competition Press and Autoweek'', April 9, 1966, Page 17.</ref>
