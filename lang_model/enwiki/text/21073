== Australian broadcasts ==
In the [[Second World War]], Pentreath was disappointed that he was "reserved" as a headmaster and therefore unable to sign up for military service. However, he felt that the war needed interpretation for Australians and he became a regular broadcaster on [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation|ABC radio]].<ref name=Obit>Obituary: "The Rev Canon Guy Pentreath, Headmaster and Hellenist". ''[[The Times]]'', 6th November 1985, p. 16.</ref> Two of these broadcasts were subsequently published by the [[Department of Information (Australia)|Australian Dept. of Information]]:

== Headmasterships ==
While [[headmaster]] of [[St. Peter's College, Adelaide]], Pentreath carried out a considerable new building programme and he developed the curriculum to include art, music and crafts to a degree unusual for the time.<ref name=Obit/> When he was appointed at [[Wrekin College]], [[Shropshire]], he inherited a near-Victorian regime. he quickly introduced his own warm and personal style of leadership, and first won over the boys and later the staff.<ref name=Obit/> "'''[[Time's Paces]]:'''" According to [[Peter Gadsden|Sir Peter Gadsden]] in the address that he gave at the Service of Thanksgiving at [[Wrekin College|Wrekin]] in 1986, Pentreath quoted the verse 'When I was a babe and wept and slept, time crept ...' in his last sermon as headmaster of [[Wrekin College|Wrekin]]. He had seen [[Henry Twells|Henry Twells']]s version in [[Chester Cathedral]] where it is to be seen attached to a clock.<ref name=archivist/> It does not appear that Pentreath publicised his shortened version in any other way. In 1952 he moved to [[Cheltenham College]] where he introduced the same ethos that had proved so successful at his earlier schools.<ref name=Obit/>

== Retirement ==
Pentreath left [[Cheltenham College]] due to the ill-health of his wife, Lesley, and was appointed [[Canon (priest)|Canon]] of [[Rochester Cathedral]] in 1959.<ref name=archivist>E-mail information provided by the [[Archivist]] at [[Cheltenham College]].</ref> He entered into the life of the cathedral with typical zest.  When not in residence,  he became a [[chaplain]] and guest lecturer on more than sixty [[Swan Hellenic]] cruises to Greece and the Eastern Mediterranean. He had a particular gift for bringing the ancient sites to life and his lectures won him many admirers. He was also Secretary of the Hellenic Travellers' Club. When he retired from cruise lecturing, he organised the Swans lecture programmes, and was much in demand as a lecturer with the [http://www.nadfas.org.uk/ National Association of Decorative & Fine Arts Societies] (NADFAS). He was working on his memoirs at the time of his death.<ref name=Obit/>
