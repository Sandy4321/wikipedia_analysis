'''Stephen Boros, Jr.''' (September 3, 1936 <U+2013> December 29, 2010) was an American [[baseball]] [[infielder]], [[coach (baseball)|coach]], [[manager (baseball)|manager]], [[scout (sports)|scout]], and administrator.  Best known for his scientific approach to the sport and his use of computers, Boros' baseball career spanned almost 50 years from his debut as a player for the [[University of Michigan]] in 1956 to his retirement in 2004 as an executive with the [[Detroit Tigers]].

After playing college baseball for the University of Michigan from 1956 to 1957, Boros signed as a [[bonus baby]] with the Detroit Tigers in June 1957.  He remained in the Tigers' organization from 1957 to 1962.  He was the most valuable player in the [[American Association (20th century)|American Association]] in 1960 and had his best major league season in 1961 despite missing six weeks with a broken collar bone.  During his tenure with the Tigers, Boros was the subject of widespread coverage of his tendency to read history books and fine literature and of his aspiration to become a professor of literature.  He finished his major league playing career with the [[Chicago Cubs]] and [[Cincinnati Reds]] from 1963 to 1965.  In 1964, he set a Reds' club record with 50 consecutive errorless games at third base.  He played a total of 13 years in professional baseball, including stints with several minor league clubs from 1957 to 1969.

In 1970, Boros began a lengthy career as a baseball manager, scout, and coach.  While working in the [[Kansas City Royals]]' farm system, he developed a reputation as a leading advocate of the [[stolen base]]. Under his leadership, the [[San Jose Bees]] set a modern minor league record with 372 stolen bases in one year.  As the first base coach of the [[Kansas City Royals]] from 1976 to 1979, he became known for his scientific approach to the stolen base, taking measurements with a stopwatch and maintaining a book on every pitcher and catcher in the [[American League]].  The Royals led the league in stolen bases in both 1978 and 1979.  As the [[Montreal Expos]] first base coach, he was credited with helping [[Tim Raines]] lead the [[National League]] in stolen bases in both 1981 and 1982.  

In 1983, Boros became the manager of the [[Oakland Athletics]].  He drew widespread press coverage after he hired a sabermetrician to track every pitch and feed the data into a mainframe computer in [[Philadelphia]].  Boros studied the data on a daily basis using an [[Apple II]] computer which he kept in the clubhouse.  Boros' cerebral approach to the game drew criticism from baseball traditionalists and resulted in unwanted press coverage for a team that finished in fourth place in 1983.  After the A's started the 1984 season with a 20-24 record, and as the press coverage of "Computer Ball" mounted, Boros was fired by the A's in May 1984.  

In February 1986, Boros was hired as the manager of the [[San Diego Padres]] after the sudden resignation of [[Dick Williams]].  The Padres finished in fourth place in 1986, and Boros was again fired.  Boros spent the next 18 years working as a scout, coach and front office administrator for the [[Los Angeles Dodgers]], [[Baltimore Orioles]], Kansas City Royals, and Detroit Tigers.  His advance scouting of the Oakland A's, and his identification of [[Dennis Eckersley]]'s  tendency to throw a backdoor [[slider]] on 3-2 counts to left-handed hitters, was credited with a behind-the-scenes assist in one of the most memorable moments in [[World Series]] history -- [[Kirk Gibson's 1988 World Series home run]].

==Early years==
Boros was a native of [[Flint, Michigan]], where his father, Stephen Boros, Sr. (1909-1994), operated a grocery store.<ref name=TSN/><ref name=BD>{{cite news|author=Bob Du Vall|title=Whatever Became of --?|publisher=Baseball Digest|date=June 1973|page=86|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=4DEDAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA86&dq=steve+boros&hl=en&sa=X&ei=DwX1T9u8O8iq2QXS_-TyBg&ved=0CF8Q6AEwCA#v=onepage&q=steve%20boros&f=false}}</ref>  Boros learned to play baseball on the playgrounds of Flint's North End and attended [[Flint Northern High School]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Steve Boros Obituary|newspaper=The Flint Journal|date=January 2, 2011|url=http://obits.mlive.com/obituaries/flint/obituary.aspx?pid=147561461}}</ref> He helped Flint Northern win Saginaw Valley League baseball championships in both 1952 and 1953.<ref>{{cite news|title=Flint native, former Tiger Steve Boros dies at 74|author=Bruce Gunther|newspaper=The Flint Journal|date=December 31, 2010|url=http://www.mlive.com/sports/flint/index.ssf/2010/12/flint_native_former_tiger_stev.html}}</ref>

==University of Michigan==
He enrolled at the [[University of Michigan]] where he received a [[bachelor of arts]] degree.<ref>Naiman, Joe, and Porter, David, ''The San Diego Padres Encyclopedia.'' Sports Publishing LLC, 2004, page 204</ref><ref name=LAT/>  He played baseball as a shortstop for the [[Michigan Wolverines baseball]] team in 1956 and 1957.  He had a .324 [[batting average]] in 1956 and .381 in 1957.  He was selected as an All-[[Big Ten Conference]] player in 1957.<ref>{{cite news|title=Steve Boros Was More Than Just An Athlete|authlor=Bruce Madej|publisher=University of Michigan|date=December 31, 2010|url=http://www.mgoblue.com/blog/2010/12/steve-boros-was-more-than-just-an-athlete.html}}</ref>  After an outstanding junior year in 1957, Boros was selected by his teammates as the captain of the 1958 team.  However, Boros became the subject of a bonus bidding war among 14 major league teams. He signed in June 1957 with the [[Detroit Tigers]] who paid him a $25,000 bonus.<ref>{{cite news|title=Tigers Sign Rookie Off Michigan Campus|newspaper=The Stars and Stripes (UP story)|date=June 18, 1957|page=19}}</ref>  Michigan's head coach [[Ray Fisher]] was angered at the loss of Boros and told the press: "Major league baseball is a cut-throat game, and they are cutting their own throats as well.  Boros told me he didn't intend to sign.  He's a good hitter and has power as good as [[Dick Wakefield]]'s when he connects."<ref name=TSN>{{cite news|title=Bengals' Bonus Lands Boros, Third Star From Michigan U.|newspaper=The Sporting News|date=June 26, 1957|page=25}}</ref>

Boros later credited college baseball with having made him a better player: "My last year in high school I hit but .275 and was a terrible fielder.  I guess college matured me. I gained some weight and picked up the confidence I lacked in high school.  If I hadn't gone to college and had signed right out of high school, I might have had one bad year and quit."<ref name=TSN3>{{cite news|title=Boros Drawing Bead on Tigers With Fast Bat: Baron Belter's Long Blows Begin to Reduce Mileage Back to Briggs Stadium|author=Frank McGowan|date=August 5, 1959|newspaper=The Sporting News|page=37}}</ref>

==Baseball player==
===Rookie season in Detroit===
Boros made his major league debut on June 19, 1957, just days after signing his bonus contract with the Tigers.  Under the rules in effect at that time, a player receiving a signing bonus was required to be kept on the major league roster for a year, a rule described as "that era's effort to prevent big-revenue teams from stockpiling the best talent."<ref name=NYT>{{cite news|author=Phil Coffin|title=Goodbye to Steve Boros, Bonus Baby, Computer Guy and Prescient Scout|newspaper=The New York Times|date=December 30, 2010|url=http://bats.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/12/30/goodbye-to-steve-boros-bonus-baby-computer-guy-and-prescient-scout/}}</ref>  Boros briefly moved into the Tigers' starting lineup, replacing a slumping [[Reno Bertoia]] at third base.  Detroit manager [[Jack Tighe]] praised Boros as "a cool customer" with "strong wrists and a quick bat."<ref name=TSN2>{{cite news|author=Warren Spoelstra|title=Tiger Bonus Baby Boros in Speedy Bow: Steve Subs at Third, Makes Good Impression There|newspaper=The Sporting News|date=July 3, 1957|page=10}}</ref>  Boros appeared in 24 games for the 1957 Tigers, including nine at third base and five at shortstop.<ref name=BR>{{cite web|title=Steve Boros Statistics and History|publisher=USA Today Sports Media Group|work=Baseball-Reference.com|url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/players/b/borosst01.shtml}}</ref>

===Minor leagues===
Boros spent most of the 1958 season in the minor leagues, including stints with the [[Augusta Tigers]] (South Atlantic League), [[Birmingham Barons]] (Southern Association), and [[Charleston Senators]] (American Association).<ref name=BRM>{{cite web|title=Steve Boros Minor League Statistics & History|publisher=USA Today Sports Media Group|work=Baseball-Reference.com|url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/minors/player.cgi?id=boros-001ste}}</ref>  He also appeared in six games for the Tigers in 1958, with only two at bats.<ref name=BR/>

During the 1959 season, Boros spent the entire season with the Birmingham Barons.  He appeared in 147 games, beginning the season at third base and then moving into the outfield.  By early August, he had earned a reputation as "one of the quickest bats in the league."<ref name=TSN3/>  He compiled a .305 [[batting average]] for the Barons with 24 doubles, seven triples, 16 [[home run]]s, 85 [[runs batted in]] (RBIs), and 23 [[stolen base]]s.<ref name=BRM/>

Boros spent the 1960 season with the [[Denver Bears]] of the Class AAA [[American Association (20th century)|American Association]].  He hit home runs in his first and third at bats for Denver and narrowly missed with a towering foul ball in his second at bat.<ref name=TSN4>{{cite news|author=Frank Haraway|title=Boros Blooming as Bear in Bid for Bengal Job|newspaper=The Sporting News|date=May 4, 1960|page=33}}</ref>  He was named the league's most valuable player while [[Carl Yastrzemski]] was named the league's best rookie.<ref name=TSN5>{{cite news|title=Boros Voted Most Valuable; Yastrzemski Rookie Winner|newspaper=The Sporting News|date=September 21, 1960|page=34}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Denver's Boros Named MVP by AA Writers|newspaper=The Stars and Stripes|date=September 16, 1960|page=19}}</ref>  He tied for the league lead with 119 RBIs, hit 30 home runs, stole 22 bases, and compiled a .317 batting average, .402 on base percentage, and .576 slugging percentage.<ref name=BRM/><ref name=TSN5/>

===Detroit Tigers===
Boros spent the full 1961 season with the Detroit Tigers, including 115 games as the team's starting [[third baseman]].  As the season got underway, Boros was touted as a "can't miss" star.  [[Joe Falls]], who was later inducted into the writers' wing of the Baseball Hall of Fame, wrote:<blockquote>"'Steve Boros can't miss.  He's got all the tools.  Great hands, great speed, great desire -- and watch him swing that bat.  He's got everything.' It may be so, too.  For this young man up from Denver . . . is the most celebrated rookie to move up to the Detroit Tigers since [[Frank Bolling]] in 1954."<ref>{{cite news|author=Joe Falls|title=Steve Boros could be club's best rookie since '54: A Confident Young Tigers|publisher=Baseball Digest|pages=81-82|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=aS0DAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA81&dq=steve+boros&hl=en&sa=X&ei=DwX1T9u8O8iq2QXS_-TyBg&ved=0CEgQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&q=steve%20boros&f=false}}</ref></blockquote>

He got off to a quick start, and by late May, he was batting .341 and "getting as much ink as Roger Maris" who went on to hit 60 home runs for the season.<ref name=TSN9/>  On May 23, 1961, he tied a major league record when [[Norm Cash]], Boros, and [[Dick Brown]] hit successive home runs for the Tigers in a game against the [[Minnesota Twins]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Detroit Homers In Ninth Inning Dump Minnesota|newspaper=Nevada State Journal (UPI story)|page=14}}</ref>  A 5-for-55 slump followed, and his batting average dipped to .283 by July.<ref name=TSN9/>  He was hospitalized overnight at Detroit Osteopathic Hospital after being struck behind the left ear and knocked unconscious by an [[Eli Grba]] pitch on July 9 at Tiger Stadium.  Boros, who was carried off the field on a stretcher, said he never saw the pitch.  Detroit manager [[Bob Scheffing]] said the batting helmet had saved Boros from a serious injury.<ref>{{cite news|title=Steve Boros, Beaned by a Grba Pitch, Makes Rapid Recovery|author=Warren Spoelstra|newspaper=The Sporting News|date=July 19, 1961|page=4}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=untitled|newspaper=The Stars and Stripes (UPI story)|date=July 11, 1961|page=17}}</ref>

Boros suffered a more serious injury on July 24, 1961, after colliding with pitcher [[Frank Lary]] while both were chasing a bunt.  Boros suffered a broken left collar bone and missed six weeks as the Tigers fought for the pennant with the [[New York Yankees]].  At the time of the injury, the Tigers were in first place in the American League, and Boros already had 53 RBIs, one more than [[Al Kaline]].  Boros spent the night at St. Luke's Hospital in Kansas City before flying home to Detroit while the rest of the team flew to the west coast for a road trip.<ref>{{cite news|title=Drydocking of Boros Helps Whet Tiger Flag Appetite: Steve Fractures Collar Bone in Collision Wit Lary; Ailing Wing Decks Fox -- Club Obtains Montejo, House|author=Watson Spoelstra|newspaper=The Sporting News|date=August 2, 1961|page=11}}</ref>  The [[1961 Detroit Tigers season|1961 Tigers]] finished with an impressive 101-61 record, but the 1961 Yankees won the pennant with a 109-53	record.<ref>{{cite news|title=1961 American League Team Statistics and Standings|publisher=USA Today Sports Media Group|work=Baseball-Reference.com|url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/leagues/AL/1961.shtml}}</ref>

Despite missing six weeks with the collar bone injury, Boros compiled a .270 batting average with a .382 on base percentage and 62 RBIs.<ref name=BR/>  ''The Sporting News'' noted that Boros' 63 RBIs in 396 at bats compared favorably with the league's best third baseman, as [[Brooks Robinson]] collected 61 RBIs in 668 at bats.<ref name=TSN8/>

In addition to having a solid season at third base, Boros also gained attention as "a book worm who can -- and does -- read as many as four books at the same time."<ref name=TSN6>{{cite news|author=Joe Falls|title=Flashy Duo With Spunk and Skill: Cool Cats Help Steam Up Charging Bengals; Wood, Boros Pace Tigers' Fast Getaway; Battling Pair of Youngsters Hit in Clutch; Third Sacker Steve Comes Up Smiling After Twirler Serves Knockdown Pitch|newspaper=The Sporting News|date=May 24, 1961|page=2}}</ref>  With plans to return to the University of Michigan in the fall to complete a degree in history, Boros' traveling library during the 1961 season included "The History of Russia," "Survey of Russia," and "Greek and Roman History."  Boros told reporter Joe Falls, "I never read just to be entertained.  I read to be informed, and my favorite is modern history, if it can be called that -- books on Eisenhower and Kennedy and our present-day administration."<ref name=TSN6/>

During the off-season between the 1961 and 1962 seasons, Boros returned to the University of Michigan seeking to complete the required coursework for his bachelor's degree.<ref>{{cite news|title=Boros, Freehan Earn and Learn: Tiger Rookies Studying at U-M In Winter|newspaper=The News-Palladium, Benton Harbor, Michigan (AP story)|date=December 28 1961|page=Sect 2, page 3}}</ref>  Joe Falls quipped that Boros "has learned that hitting the books is one thing; hitting an inside fastball is another."<ref name=TSN9>{{cite news|author=Joe Falls|title=Boros, Burning Over '61 Skid, Vents Ire on Inside Fastball: Steve Embarrassed by Only Five Homers Last Year; Hurlers Started to Jam Him on Second Time Around|newspaper=The Sporting News|date=March 14, 1962|page=16}}</ref>  The ''Associated Press'' also published a feature story about Boros' studious nature in March 1962.  The article noted that Boros was studying contemporary literature in the off-season and hoped to become a professor of literature.  The article added: "Hardly a day goes by when Boros isn't carrying two or three books under his arms.  He reads in hotel rooms, on planes and on trains."<ref name=Books/>  Boros recalled that some of his minor league coaches had opposed his reading, claiming it was bad for his eyes.  As for ribbing by his fellow player, he noted that Detroit pitcher [[Paul Foytack]] replied to a good fielding play by Boros by yelling, "Atta boy, Steve. Just for that I'll buy you a book."<ref name=Books>{{cite news|title=An Intellectual Tiger: Boros Hopes to Become Professor of Literature|newspaper=Appleton Post Crescent (AP story)|date=April 1, 1962|page=16}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|author=Joe Reichler|title=Boros' Ambition To Be Professor|newspaper=Lancaster Eagle Gazette, Lancaster, Ohio (AP story)|date=March 30, 1962|page=17}}</ref>

In December 1961, Boros became the third member of the Tigers to sign a contract for the 1962 season.  Detroit vice president [[Rick Ferrell]] said at the time, "Boros got a good raise.  He was entitled to it.  He had a wonderful first year.  Steve will be even better next summer, in my opinion."<ref name=TSN8>{{cite news|title=Boros' Booming Bat Brings Big Boost In Salary: Bengals' Rookie Notched 62 RBIs Despite Missing Six Weeks With Broken Collar Bone|author=Warren Spoelstra|newspaper=The Sporting News|date=January 3, 1962|page=25}}</ref>

In 1962, Boros saw his batting average slump to .228, though his propensity to draw bases on balls buoyed his on base percentage over 100 points to .331.  His 14 doubles and 16 home runs provided a .407 slugging percentage.<ref name=BR/>  On August 6, 1962, Boros became the eighth Detroit Tiger to hit three home runs in one game -- accomplishing the feat against the [[Cleveland Indians]], including two home runs off [[Sam McDowell]]. After the game, Boros said, "I'm swinging the bat like I did two years ago."<ref>{{cite news|author=Warren Spoelstra|title=Tigers Looking to Koplitz, Boros to Spring Trap|date=August 18, 1962|newspaper=The Sporting News|page=11}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title='Every Time I Clout Homer, Tigers Lose,' Boros Moans|date=August 18, 1962|newspaper=The Sporting News|page=11}}</ref>  Two weeks later, he hit his first major league grand slam in the first inning of a game against the [[Minnesota Twins|Washington Senators]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Tigers 11, Nats 1|newspaper=Nevada State Journal (UPI story)|date=August 25, 1962|page=8}}</ref>  The next day, he achieved a less desirable distinction when he tied an American League record by committing four errors, two in one inning.<ref>{{cite news|title=A Day to Forget ...|newspaper=Traverse City Eagle|date=August 24, 1962|page=19}}</ref>

===Chicago Cubs===
On November 28, 1962, Boros was traded by the Tigers to the [[Chicago Cubs]] for pitcher [[Bob Anderson (baseball)|Bob Anderson]].  The Cubs' vice president [[John Holland]] said he expected Boros to provide "protection in the infield" and prove valuable as a righthanded pinch-hitter.<ref>{{cite news|title=Boros Boosts Bruins' Bench, Power Rating: Ex-Tiger Walloped 16 HRs in '62 Despite a 42-Point Drop in His Bat Average|author=Jerome Holtzman|newspaper=The Sporting News|date=December 8, 1962|page=10}}</ref>  Boros had been a leading candidate for the American League Rookie of the Year award until he broke his collar bone in August 1961.<ref name=TSN10/>  Less than two years later, and with [[Ron Santo]] securely entrenched as the Cubs' third baseman, he spent most of the 1963 season on the Cubs' bench.  Boros appeared in 41 games for the 1963 Cubs, including 14 at first base and 11 as an outfielder.  He compiled a .211 batting average in 90 at bats, though his on base percentage was nearly 100 points higher at .304.<ref name=BR/>

===Cincinnati Reds===
On December 14, 1963, Boros was purchased by the [[Cincinnati Reds]] from the Cubs.<ref name=BR/>  He was acquired for a sum that ''The Sporting News'' described as "peanuts" and assigned to the Reds' [[San Diego Padres (PCL)|San Diego Padres]] farm team in the [[Pacific Coast League]]. However, he was invited to spring training with the Reds in [[Tampa, Florida|Tampa]].<ref name=TSN10>{{cite news|author=Earl Lawson|title=Faded Phenom Boros Listens -- Opportunity Knocks Once More|newspaper=The Sporting News|date=February 22, 1964|page=19}}</ref>  

With the departure of the Reds' two regular third basemen, [[Chico Ruiz]] opened the 1964 season as the Reds' starting third baseman, and Boros was returned to San Diego.  However, Boros was quickly called up by the Reds and became the team's regular [[third baseman]] by the second week of May 1964.  By early July, Boros was batting slightly under .300, set a club record with 50 errorless games, and had established himself as "one of the top favorites among Red fans."<ref name=TSN11>{{cite news|author=Earl Lawson|title=Boros Like 20-Mule Team Pulling Share of Red Load|newspaper=The Sporting News|date=July 11, 1964|page=30}}</ref><ref name=BD/>  Boros' streak was seven games short of the National League record of 57 errorless games by third baseman [[Bob Aspromonte]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Rookie Red Hurler Stifles Card Threat|newspaper=The Stars and Stripes (AP story)|date=July 6, 1964|page=19}}</ref>  Boros credited his improvement in fielding to his studying the play of [[Ron Santo]] in Chicago during the 1963 season.  Boros concluded that Santos was the best third baseman he had ever seen.  Previously, Boros had tried to be a "cool, graceful player of the [[Gil McDougald]] type."<ref name=Santo/>  Based on his observation of Santo, he changed his philosophy and changed into "a scrambling, aggressive type."<ref name=Santo>{{cite news|title=Scrambling Pays Off For Reds' Boros|newspaper=Tucson Daily Citizen (AP story)|date=July 2, 1964|page=40}}</ref>  He later described the 50-game errorless streak as his biggest thrill in baseball.<ref name=BD/>  

During the 1964 season, Boros started 113 games at third base, compiling a .257 batting average and .342 on base percentage in 370 at bats.<ref name=BR/>  At the start of the 1965 season, the Reds moved [[Deron Johnson]] from first to third base and had no further need for Boros.  He appeared in only two games for the Reds in 1965, making his final major league appearance on May 8, 1965.<ref name=BR/>

In all or parts of seven major league seasons, Boros batted .245 with a .344 on base percentage and 26 home runs.<ref name=BR/>

===Return to the minor leagues===
Boros continued to play at the AAA level through 1969.  He appeared in 117 games for the [[San Diego Padres (PCL)|San Diego Padres]] of the [[Pacific Coast League]] in 1965.  He spent the 1966 and 1967 seasons with the [[Buffalo Bisons]] in the [[International League]].  He split the 1968 season between the [[Indianapolis Indians]] and [[Vancouver Mounties]] in the [[Pacific Coast League]] and finished his playing career with the [[Omaha Royals]] of the American Association.<ref name=BRM/>

==Baseball manager, coach and scout==
===Kansas City Royals===
Boros began a managerial career in the [[Kansas City Royals]] farm system in 1970. He was the manager of the Royals' [[Waterloo, Iowa]] farm team from 1970 to 1972.  While managing in Waterloo, he was ejected from a game after protesting what he called "a series of atrocious calls."  Boros retreated to the clubhouse where he hand-lettered a sign that read "Umpires."  He nailed the sign to the scoreboard on top of the visting team's name.  At the end of the game, the scoreboard read, "Umpires 9, Waterloo 2."  Boros was fined $100 for the incident.<ref>{{cite news|author=Stan Isle|title=Leonard Learns He's Well Off|newspaper=The Sporting News|date=June 20, 1983|page=7}}</ref>

In January 1973, Boros was transferred to the Royals' other Class A affiliate, [[San Jose Bees]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Royals select Waterloo coach|newspaper=Billings Gazette (AP story)|date=January 10, 1973|page=}}</ref>  Boros was the manager in San Jose during the 1973 and 1974 seasons.  Under his management, San Jose set a modern minor league record with 372 stolen bases.<ref name=TSN13/><ref name=LAT2>{{cite news|title=Boros Is Perfect Contrast to Past|author=Tom Friend|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=February 26, 1986|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1986-02-26/sports/sp-162_1_steve-boros}}</ref>  

At the end of September 1974, the Royals announced that Boros was being elevated to the major league club to replace [[Charley Lau]] on the team's coaching staff for the 1975 season.<ref>{{cite news|title=Steve Boros To Coach K.C. Royals|newspaper=The Gettysburg Times (Gettysburg, Pennsylvania)
|date=September 30, 1974|page=11}}</ref>  He was the Royals' third base coach in 1975 under manager [[Whitey Herzog]].  From 1976 to 1979, he was the Royal's first base coach and was "credited with helping the Royals develop an aggressive baserunning style."<ref name=TSN13/>  While Boros was in Kansas City, he began to attract media attention for his "scientific approach" to baseball.<ref name=KC/>  In July 1977, the UPI published a feature story about Boros in which it observed:<blockquote>"Boros began putting a book together on all the pitchers and catchers in the American League last year, noting their strengths and weaknesses and any tipoffs that might give Royal runners an edge on the basepaths.  His observations were written into a small 25-cent notepad along with a flock of stopwatch readings that represent the time it takes a pitcher to throw the ball to home plate out of both the stretch and windup, and how long it takes a catcher to peg the ball to second and third base."<ref name=KC>{{cite news|title=Kansas City tries scientific approach: Notebook, speed key to stolen bases|newspaper=The Lincoln Star (AP story)|date=July 24 1977|page=E1}}</ref></blockquote>

Boros also studied pitchers, looking for tipoffs that they intended to throw to first base.  He said, "There's always some tipoff.  The head, the shoulder, the hip, the knee, the toe -- every pitcher has something that gives away his pickoff move.  When you find it, you've got the upper hand on the base baths."<ref name=KC/>  With the benefit of Boros' scientific approach, the Royals led the American League in stolen bases in both 1978 (216) and 1979 (207).<ref name=t78>{{cite web|title=1978 Kansas City Royals|publisher=USA Today Sports Media Group|work=Baseball-Reference.com|url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/teams/KCR/1978.shtml|accessdate=July 5, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=1979 Kansas City Royals|publisher=USA Today Sports Media Group|work=Baseball-Reference.com|url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/teams/KCR/1979.shtml|accessdate=July 5, 2012}}</ref>  The 1978 team had eight players (led by [[Willie Wilson]], [[Freddie Patek]], [[Amos Otis]], [[George Brett]], and [[Hal McRae]]) who stole at least 10 bases and won the [[American League West]] pennant with a record of 92-70.<ref name=t78/>

===Montreal Expos===
In 1980, Boros was hired by the [[Montreal Expos]] organization and managed the [[Calgary Expos]].  During the 1981 and 1982 seasons, he was the first base coach for the Montreal Expos.<ref name=TSN13/>  Boros was hired by the Expos in part due to his reputation as one of the best coaches in baseball at teaching base stealing technique.  His San Jose team set the modern minor league record with 372 stolen bases,<ref name=TSN13/> and the Royals led the American League in stolen bases during his tenure there. During Boros' two seasons as the Expos' first base coach, [[Tim Raines]] became the leading base stealer in the National League with 71 and 78 stolen bases in 1981 and 1982.<ref>{{cite news|title=Tim Raines Statistics and History|publisher=USA Today Media Group|work=Baseball-Reference.com|url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/players/r/raineti01.shtml}}</ref>  In May 1981, ''Sports Illustrated'' credited Boros with Raines' sudden burst of base-stealing: "Boros deserves some of the credit for Raines' base-running success. Positioning himself a few yards up the first base line from the bag, Boros surveys the mound from the same angle as Raines, notes whether the pitcher signals his move home with his front leg, front shoulder or head, and records his findings in a notebook. Boros also carries a stopwatch to time pitchers' deliveries home and catchers' throws to second."<ref>{{cite news|title=Raines Really Pours It On: Montreal's rookie leftfielder has been a one-man deluge, leading the major leagues with 20 steals in his first 19 games while batting .373 and scoring 14 runs |publisher=Sports Illustrated|date=May 11, 1981|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1124460/index.htm}}</ref>

A March 1982 feature story by [[Peter Gammons]] focused on Boros' mentoring of Raines.  Gammons described Boros as the "leading exponent" in baseball of the stolen base.<ref name=gammons/>  Gammons added: "Boros is [[Lee Strasberg]] to Raines and the host of young speedsters coming through the Expos organization, constantly mixing technique and science with the athlete's artistic ability.  There is constant work with measured leads and jumps and acceleration.  Boros keeps a stop-watch on every catcher and pitcher in the league and records it all, along with telltale quirks and motions."<ref name=gammons>{{cite news|author=Peter Gammons|title=Expos lead baseball's new wave -- speed: Tim Raines, under tutelage of Expos' coach Steve Boros, may crack majors's base-stealing mark|newspaper=The Montreal Gazette|date=March 27, 1982|page=H2|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1946&dat=19820327&id=Aoc1AAAAIBAJ&sjid=96QFAAAAIBAJ&pg=3173,2192672}}</ref>  In August 1982, another feature story ran by the ''Associated Press'' was titled, "Expos' coach lives by stopwatch."<ref>{{cite news|author=Ben Walker|title=Expos' coach lives by stopwatch|newspaper=The Gettysburg Times (AP story)|date=August 17, 1982|page=12}}</ref>

Boros preferred to refer to himself an advocate of base running: "I've always been a strong advocate of base running, not necessarily base stealing, but base running. Because ultimately, you win because you score more runs, and what I want is to be 90-feet smarter and 90-feet more aggressive than the other team."<ref name=LAT2/>  Always a student of the game, Boros' attitude toward the stolen base had changed by 1986.  In  an interview that year, Boros said: "The science against stealing has evolved radically in the last four or five years.  That has made it tougher than ever to steal.  Pitchers have quicker deliveries, step off and quick pitch, hold the ball. Catchers pitch out much more often.  Now you've got pitching coaches with stopwatches timing pitchers' deliveries, while other coaches are timing catchers' throws to second base."<ref>{{cite book|author=Russell Roberts|title=Stolen!: A History of Base Stealing|page=185|publisher=McFarland|year=1999|isbn=078640650X}}</ref>

===Oakland Athletics===
====Hiring====
In November 1982, Boros was hired as the manager of the [[Oakland Athletics]], replacing [[Billy Martin]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=MGseAAAAIBAJ&sjid=-8gEAAAAIBAJ&pg=2814,3995900&dq=steve-boros+baseball&hl=en|title=Steve Boros new A's chief|date=16 November 1982|work=[[TimesDaily]]|publisher=[[United Press International|UPI]]|page=19|accessdate=4 June 2010}}</ref>  Baseball writer [[Peter Gammons]] called Boros "quiet, thoughtful and intelligent," while one American League manager said the move "could be one of the best managerial hirings in 10 years."<ref>{{cite news|author=Peter Gammons|title=Boros the Right Man in Stabilizing A's|newspaper=The Sporting News|date=November 29, 1982|page=59}}</ref>  Martin, who had implemented his trademark "Billy Ball" in Oakland, was known for his hot-tempered approach to the game.  ''The Sporting News'' noted the difference in style between Martin and Boros: "The volatile, dirt-kicking days are over for the time being in Oakland.  Steve Boros, the man named to succeed Billy Martin, will live on the quiet side of Manager's Row. . . .  Unlike Martin, Boros said he will not rant and rave.  He has been kicked out of just two games in his 25-year pro baseball career."<ref name=TSN13>{{cite news|author=Kit Stier|title=A's Pick Boros To Create Calm|newspaper=The Sporting News|date=November 29, 1982|page=61}}</ref>

====Computer pioneer====
[[File:Steve Boros and His Apple II.png|thumb|200px|right|Boros and his [[Apple II]] in 1983. (Anthony Nestle/Sports Illustrated)]]
During the 1983 season, Boros gained note for his pioneering use of "[[sabermetrics]]" and a computer to help guide his managerial decisions.<ref name=Schwartz>{{cite book|author=Alan Schwarz, Peter Gammons|title=The Numbers Game: Baseball's Lifelong Fascination With Statistics|publisher=Macmillan|year=2005|pages=146-147|isbn=0312322232}}</ref>  In his book on baseball innovations, historian Peter Morris wrote that Boros was "the first manager to make extensive use of computers in his decision-making process."<ref name=Morris>{{cite book|author=Peter Morris|title=A Game of Inches: The Stories Behind the Innovations that Shaped Baseball|page=354|publisher=Ivan R. Dee|year=2006}}</ref>  After every game, Boros had pitch-by-pitch data fed into a mainframe computer at [[Digital Equipment Corporation]] in Philadelphia. He would retrieve the data before the next game, analyzing how each pitcher and hitter matched up.<ref name=SI2/>  Jay Alves, a "sabermetrician" hired by Boros to run the computer system,<ref name=PM/> later recalled: "With Steve, we tracked (on paper) virtually every pitch and where it was hit.  Then I'd type it into the computer after the game, but that would take a couple of hours.  That's how long it takes me to do it with pencil and paper."<ref>{{cite news|author=Jody Meacham|title=Computers Finally Getting A Turn At Bat|publisher=Baseball Digest (reprinted from the San Jose Mercury News)|date=December 1990|page=77|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=Jy4DAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA77&dq=steve+boros&hl=en&sa=X&ei=uwj1T-CnFeS02wXbppDvBg&ved=0CDgQ6AEwATgU#v=onepage&q=steve%20boros&f=false}}</ref> 

In April 1983, a sports writer noted: "These days in the Oakland Coliseum, where the Athletics do their thing, the phrase is 'Computer Ball' [not 'BillyBall,'] as programmed by Martin's successor, Steve Boros."<ref name=More>{{cite web|title=More on Sabermetrics in 1983 (With a Focus on Steve Boros)|publisher=Misc. Baseball|accessdate=July 4, 2012|url=http://miscbaseball.wordpress.com/tag/steve-boros/}}(quoting from a column by Jim Henneman in the Baltimore ''Sun''.)</ref>  In May 1983, ''[[Newsweek]]'' published a story on Boros's pioneering use of the computer titled, "The Computers of Summer."<ref>{{cite news|title=The Computers of Summer|publisher=Newsweek|date=May 23, 1983|url=http://miscbaseball.wordpress.com/2009/06/10/sabermetrics-in-1983/}}</ref>  In a June 1983 feature story titled "It's the Apple of His Eye," ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'' wrote that Boros made access to a computer a condition of his hiring and used an [[Apple II]], loaded with pitch-by-pitch data from the 1981 and 1982 seasons, as a scouting tool.<ref name=SI2/>  The article's author opined: "Though traditionalists may shudder at the thought, it was inevitable that such a stat-happy pursuit as baseball would plug into a data bank. And Boros, 46, a Michigan grad who plans to take classes in computer science during the off-season, is in the forefront of a new wave of enlightened technocrats who are rewiring the game."<ref name=SI2/>  However, Boros tried to downplay his reliance on the computer, noting, "We're not down in the dugout frantically leafing through pages of computer printouts. I'm too busy watching my pitchers for signs of fatigue or checking my base runners <U+2014> all the little nuances and gut feelings that you get and no computer can pick up. However, I do study the printouts before each game."<ref name=SI2>{{cite news|title=It's The Apple Of His Eye: A's Manager Steve Boros is helping lead baseball into the computer age|author=Ray Kennedy|publisher=Sports Illustrated|date=June 6, 1983|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1120903/1/index.htm}}</ref>  

During the 1983 and 1984 seasons, Boros' use of the computer was also profiled in several other publications, including ''[[Psychology Today]]'' ("The Microchipped Diamond"), ''[[InfoWorld]]'' ("Playing Ball With Micros"), ''Digital Deli'' ("Computer Ball"), and ''[[Popular Mechanics]]'' ("Science Goes To Bat").<ref name=Morris/><ref>{{cite news|title=The Computer and Sports|publisher=InfoWorld|page=51|date=December 12, 1983|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=5i8EAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA51&dq=steve+boros&hl=en&sa=X&ei=uwj1T-CnFeS02wXbppDvBg&ved=0CEMQ6AEwAzgU#v=onepage&q=steve%20boros&f=false}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Playing Ball With Micros: Baseball teams apply high-tech to hitting, pitching|publisher=InfoWorld|date=August 13, 1984|page=25-26|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=GS8EAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA26&dq=steve+boros&hl=en&sa=X&ei=rgv1T4a9NoGC2AW_84DQBg&ved=0CFwQ6AEwCDge#v=onepage&q=steve%20boros&f=false}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Computer Ball|publisher=Digital Deli|date=1984|page=338|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=FYIfAQAAIAAJ&q=steve+boros+computer&dq=steve+boros+computer&hl=en&sa=X&ei=Wg31T4SJIqeL2AWYmrz_Bg&ved=0CEsQ6AEwBA}}</ref><ref name=PM>{{cite news|title=Science Goes To Bat|publisher=Popular Mechanics|date=May 1984|pages=71-73|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=FuMDAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA73&dq=steve+boros&hl=en&sa=X&ei=rgv1T4a9NoGC2AW_84DQBg&ved=0CFgQ6AEwBzge#v=onepage&q=steve%20boros&f=false}}</ref> 

====1983 season====
Despite Boros' use of the computer, the 1983 A's finished in fourth place in the American League West with a record of 74-88.<ref name=BRMG>{{cite web|title=Steve Boros Managerial Record|publisher=USA Today Sports Media Group|work=Baseball-Reference.com|url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/managers/borosst01.shtml}}</ref>  Boros had long been an advocate of stealing bases, and his 1983 team totaled 235 stolen bases -- more than any team in the American League since the [[1976 Oakland Athletics season|1975 Athletics]].<ref>{{cite web|title=1983 American League Team Statistics and Standings|publisher=USA Today Sports Media Group|work=Baseball-Reference.com|url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/leagues/AL/1983.shtml}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=1976 American League Team Statistics and Standings|publisher=USA Today Sports Media Group|work=Baseball-Reference.com|url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/leagues/AL/1976.shtml}}</ref>  The team was handicapped by a pitching staff on which no pitcher won more than 12 games and which compiled a 4.34 [[earned run average]], ranking 12th of 15 teams in the American League.<ref>{{cite web|title=1983 American League Team Statistics and Standings|publisher=USA Today Sports Media Group|work=Basebal-Reference.com|url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/leagues/AL/1983.shtml}}</ref>  In a game against the [[Minnesota Twins]] on May 18, 1983, Boros put infielder [[Wayne Gross]] into the game as a pitcher, after the A's fell behind by a 16-5 score.  Gross had not pitched since he was age 13.  Boros was critical of the Twins' home field at the [[Metrodome]] saying there was no point in using a "real pitcher" and adding, "I used a joke pitcher for a joke park."<ref>{{cite news|title=Gross Takes Mound in 16-5 A's Loss|newspaper=The Sporting News|date=May 30, 1983|page=38}}</ref>

====1984 season====
Before the 1984 season got underway, Boros' notoriety from his use of a computer became a distraction in the eyes of team management and baseball traditionalists.  Longtime friend [[Phil Regan]] recalled, "He received some criticism for using computers in the mid-1980's and now everyone in the game uses computers."<ref name=MLB/> In their book on baseball's fascination with statistics, Alan Schwartz and [[Peter Gammons]] wrote:<blockquote>"Baseball's conservatives howled in horror.  As 1984 neared, you'd think that [[George Orwell]] was in the press box: Almost every article on baseball and computers used a silly, futuristic lead, with machines replacing managers and robots turning double plays. . . . Steve Boros woke up one morning as the standard bearer of baseball's on-field information revolution.  After one year on the job, having been profiled in dozens of publications and all but cast as a circus freak, he became unpopular enough in his own clubhouse that he was fired midway through the 1984 season."<ref name=Schwartz/></blockquote>

After the A's got off to a 20-24 start (2-1/2 games out of first place) in 1984, Boros was fired in late May and replaced with first base coach [[Jackie Moore (baseball)|Jackie Moore]].<ref>{{cite news|title=A's fire Boros|newspaper=The Chillicothe Constitution Tribune, Chillicothe, Missouri (AP story)|date=May 25, 1984|page=3}}</ref>  The firing came hours after a team meeting in which Boros told the players that he would not change his personality.  First baseman [[Bruce Bochte]] said, "Steve indicated there was a lot of talk going around, that his situation wasn't stable.  He said he was going to go ahead and be the kind of manager he had been, that he wasn't going to change to keep his job."<ref name=TSN15>{{cite news|author=Kit Stier|title=Moore Replaces Boros as Pilot|newspaper=The Sporting News|date=June 4, 1984|page=22}}</ref>

====Reaction to firing====
The A's offered Boros a front-office job, but he declined.<ref name=TSN16/>  Unemployed during a baseball season for the first time in over 20 years, Boros said he would take some time off but hoped to manage again.  He met with the press at his home, drinking from a cup that read "No More Mr. Nice Guy."  He noted that the team's management felt he wasn't tough enough on the players, especially [[Rickey Henderson]].  Boros said, "This nice guy label -- I'm kind of getting clubbed to death with it.  The public misinterpreted it when it saw a manger who went and talked to his players and asked their feelings.  That all helped to create this impression of too nice a guy, one who can't make up his mind.  The players are telling him what to do."<ref name=TSN16>{{cite news|title=Boros Wants Second Chance|newspaper=The Sporting News|date=June 11, 1984|newspaper=The Sporting News|page=22}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|author=Henry Hecht|title=Nice Isn't A Vice|publisher=Sports Illustrated|date=June 11, 1984|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1122175/index.htm}}</ref>  ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'' ran a feature on the firing of Boros several months later.  The article refuted the charge that Boros lacked toughness but opened as follows:<blockquote>"When the Oakland A's dismissed Steve Boros in May, the manager's failing was more narrowly defined: He wasn't 'tough enough.'  Newspapers across the country solemnly reported this canard. The shortcoming most mentioned was that the A's skipper didn't sufficiently 'stand up for his players'; that is, he didn't kick dirt on umpires or get thrown out of games. It was also revealed that Boros had read more than 100 books, cover to cover, and had other wimpy interests.  Real men don't eat quiche. Tough guys don't dance. And so on."<ref name=SI>{{cite news|author=John Garrity|title=Steve Boros Not Tough Enough? He Was In A Showdown With Amos Otis|publisher=Sports Illustrated|date=November 19, 1984|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1135912/index.htm}}</ref></blockquote>

Boros noted: "When they talk about toughness, they always talk about arguing bad calls, spitting in an umpire's eye, kicking dust <U+2014> all that macho image stuff. . . . If the fans saw that kind of behavior in a football coach, they'd be repelled by it. Isn't it funny that one kind of behavior is expected from a football coach and another from a baseball manager? And they both have essentially the same job. It seems to me it takes a certain amount of mental toughness to keep control of your emotions. You owe it to management, your players and the fans to keep yourself under control at critical moments."<ref name=SI/>

===San Diego Padres===
In late 1984, Boros was hired as the director of minor league instruction for the [[San Diego Padres]].  When the Padres' manager [[Dick Williams]] resigned suddenly at the start of spring training in late February 1986, Boros was hired to replace him. Boros was perceived as the antithesis of the "gruff and uncommunicative" Williams.  Boros noted, "Dick likes to be aloof, apart from the players.  I like to be close to them.  I really like young players and enjoy working with them."<ref>{{cite news|author=Phil Collier|title=Boros Hired . . . Padres Pleased|newspaper=The Sporting News|date=March 10, 1986|page=33}}</ref>  ''Sports Illustrated'' wrote as follows about the contrast between Williams and Boros:<blockquote>"The move may not have been as revolutionary as the introduction of the [[McDLT|McD.L.T.]], but last week the hamburger-funded San Diego Padres went from the hot of Dick Williams to the cool of Steve Boros. . . . [I]t marked the greatest contrast in successive baseball managers since, well, since Steve Boros followed Billy Martin in Oakland."<ref>{{cite news|author=Jaime Diaz|title=A Fresh Breeze Cools The Desert Air: Under Dick Williams, the Padres had become a sullen team. Now he's out and Steve Boros promises them a new beginning|publisher=Sports Illustrated|date=March 10, 1986|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1064573/index.htm}}</ref></blockquote>

In an interview with the ''San Diego Union'' at the start of the 1986 season, Boros assured Padres fans that he would not make extensive use of the computer as he had in Oakland.  The resulting article noted:<blockquote>"At Oakland, Boros used computers extensively, studying percentages and tendencies to guide his strategic decisions, but at heart, he is a humanist. He would rather read a good baseball novel than a complex statistical analysis of the game. 'I found that players are very suspicious of computers, much like the general public,' he said. 'They fear them as cold and impersonal and inhuman. I couldn't make them understand that I was still going to make my own decisions, I wasn't going to let the computer make them for me. I'm going to use some data and stats here, but we won't have a computer and a programmer in the clubhouse like we did in Oakland."<ref name=More/></blockquote>

One of Boros' first difficult managerial decisions resulted from stiff competition for the starting first baseman job.  [[Steve Garvey]] began the season as the team's starting first baseman, but Boros saw the potential of rookie [[John Kruk]].  By late July, Boros concluded that Kruk deserved to be in the lineup and began alternating him at first base and in the outfield.<ref>{{cite news |title=Boros Finds Kruk a Spot|newspaper=The Sporting News|date=August 11, 1986|page=27}}</ref>  Another widely publicized incident during Boros' tenure with the Padres occurred in early June 1986 when he was ejected before the first pitch in a game against the [[Atlanta Braves]].  During the exchange of lineup cards, Boros tried to hand a videotape to the umpire who had made a disputed call the previous night resulting in a triple play.  Boros was ejected for the first time in 259 games as a major league manager.<ref name=USA/><ref>{{cite news|title=Boros Is Ejected Before Game Even Starts : Padre Manager Brings Out a Videotape of Previous Night's Call|author=Steve Dolan|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=June 7, 1986|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1986-06-07/sports/sp-10084_1_previous-night}}</ref>

Boros also developed a reputation for constant tinkering with the lineup.  In August 1985, veteran [[Graig Nettles gave Boros the nickname, "Mr. Moves."  Boros responded by benching the slumping Nettles and joking that, while he'd tried a lot of things, "that's one thing I didn't try."<ref>{{cite news|title=Graig Nettles, who labeled Padres Manager Steve Boros "Mr. Moves"|newspaper=Orlando Sentinel|date=August 21, 1986|url=http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/1986-08-21/sports/0250030048_1_nettles-boros-graig}}</ref><ref name=USA>{{cite news|title=Former MLB manager, infielder Steve Boros dies at 74|newspaper=USA Today|date=December 30, 2010|url=http://www.usatoday.com/sports/baseball/2010-12-30-steve-boros-obit_N.htm}}</ref>  Boros set a Padres team record in a September 22 game against the [[Atlanta Braves]] by using 22 players, including six pitchers, in a nine-inning game.<ref>{{cite news|title=Padres|newspaper=The Sporting News|date=October 6, 1986|page=16}}</ref>

By September 1986, speculation began that he would not be retained as the team's manager.  ''The Sporting News'' reported: "The Padres have foundered under his direction, sagging to last place in the National League west.  While there are myriad extenuations -- injuries to starting pitchers [[Eric Show]] and [[Dave Dravecky]] chief among them -- those closest to the club's management have privately expressed doubts about whether Boros will be asked back."<ref name=TSN18>{{cite news|title=Padres|newspaper=The Sporting News|date=September 22, 1986|page=17}}</ref>  Boros replied that the speculation was "as predictable as the leaves turning in September and October."<ref name=TSN18/>

Having played in the [[1984 World Series|World Series]] two years earlier, the 1986 Padres finished in fourth place in the National League West with a disappointing record of 74-88.<ref name=BRMG/>  The speculation that Boros would be fired proved accurate, as he was replaced by [[Larry Bowa]] on October 24, 1986.  Boros said at the time, "I was prepared for the fact that I wouldn't be coming back. . . .  It's like the good news and bad news joke.  The good news was that at the end of the season I hadn't been fired. The bad news was I hadn't been rehired."<ref>{{cite news|title=Padres|newspaper=The Sporting News|date=November 17, 1986|page=57}}</ref>

===Later years===
After his managerial career, Boros worked as a scout and coach for several teams.  His work as an advance scout for the [[Los Angeles Dodgers]] in 1988 resulted in one of the most memorable moments in [[World Series]] history -- [[Kirk Gibson's 1988 World Series home run]].  Boros was part of a scout team that studied the Athletics, the Dodgers' opponent in the [[1988 World Series]]. Boros noted that Oakland [[relief pitcher|relief ace]] [[Dennis Eckersley]] tended to throw a backdoor [[slider]] on 3-2 counts to left-handed hitters.  When Eckersley threw that pitch to [[Kirk Gibson]] in the ninth inning of the first game of the World Series, Gibson hit a home run to win the game for the Dodgers.<ref name=LAT/><ref>{{cite news|url= |title=Former MLB manager, player Steve Boros dies at 74|date=31 December 2010|publisher=[[The Washington Post]]|accessdate=31 December 2010}}</ref>  Gibson's home run was voted the "greatest moment in L.A. sports history" in a 1995 poll.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2008/oct/15/sports/sp-gibson15|title=Reliving the moment of home run by Dodgers' Kirk Gibson, 20 years later|last=Mitchell|first=Houston|date=2008-10-15|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|accessdate=2009-03-30}}</ref> 

He worked for the Kansas City Royals from 1993 to 1994 and for the [[Baltimore Orioles]] in 1995.  [[Phil Regan]], who had been friends with Boros since the 1950s, hired Boros at Baltimore and later recalled, "When I became the manager at Baltimore in 1995, one of my first calls was to Steve and he joined us as my third-base coach.  Steve was one of the finest baserunning instructors of his time. He was one of the first guys to always have a stop watch in his hand to clock both runners and the time it takes for a pitcher to throw to first base."<ref name=MLB/>

Boros was hired by the [[Detroit Tigers]] in 1996 and served as the team's minor league field coordinator from 1996 to 2002.  He became the Tigers' director of player development in 2003 and a special assistant to general manager [[Dave Dombrowski]] in 2004.<ref name=LAT/>

==Family and death==
