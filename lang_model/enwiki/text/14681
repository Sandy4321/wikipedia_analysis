The party endorses a European-style [[social democracy]] to diminish wealth disparities without impeding freedom or economic competitiveness and is among only a few parties to encourage a secular, non-[[Confessionalism (politics)|confessional]] state. The DLM actively participated in the 2005 [[Cedar Revolution]], a wave of demonstrations against the [[Syrian occupation of Lebanon]], and calls for correcting imbalanced relations with [[Syria]]. 

The DLM won its first parliamentary seat in [[Lebanese general election, 2005|Lebanon's 2005 elections]] representing the Tripoli district. On June 2, 2005, amid election rounds, [[Samir Kassir]], a founder of the movement, was assassinated in a car bombing. Less than one month later, on June 21, 2005, [[George Hawi]], a former secretary general of the [[Lebanese Communist Party]] and an ally of the DLM, was killed in a similar car bombing in [[Beirut]]. In the [[Lebanese general election, 2009|2009 elections]], the party again won a single seat, instead representing the West Bekaa district. It is a member of the [[March 14 Alliance]], a pro-Western political coalition and parliamentary majority named after the [[Cedar_Revolution#Resurgent_counter-demonstrations|March 14, 2005, mass demonstration]] memorializing the assassination of [[Rafik Hariri]].<ref name="March14">{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2009/WORLD/meast/06/08/lebanon.vote/index.html|title=Pro-West bloc retains control in Lebanon|last=Perry |first=Cal |coauthors=Husseini Nada|date=2009-06-08|work=CNN|accessdate=2009-07-23}}</ref>
 
== Early History ==
===Background and foundation===
[[Image:Flag of the Lebanese Communist Party.svg<U+200E>|right|thumbnail|200px|The Democratic Left Movement was founded by activists and intellectuals who split from the [[Lebanese Communist Party]],<ref name="Lebanon" /> whose flag is shown above.]]
The rise of [[Islamic Fundamentalism]], the [[Soviet_Union#Reforms_of_Gorbachev_and_collapse_of_the_Soviet_Union|fall of the Soviet Union]], and the inability of the LCP to take on a more open and [[democratic socialism|democratic socialist]] platform ushered in an era of political decline for the party. This, coupled with a perceived Syrian domination of its leadership, led to increasing frustration among rank-and-file communists against the upper echelons of the party.<ref name="RCF"> {{Cite news | volume = 2 | issue = 10 | last = Nassif | first = Daniel | title = Dissidents in Communist Party Revolt against Damascus | work = [[Middle East Intelligence Bulletin]] | accessdate = 2009-07-05 | date = 2000-11 | url = http://www.meib.org/articles/0011_l3.htm }}</ref> 

On September 13, 2000, a group calling itself "the reform and democracy forces in the Lebanese Communist Party" wrote an open letter demanding the resignation of the party's leadership. Led by [[Elias Atallah]], the dissidents accused the LCP's leaders of subservience to [[Syria]] and called for full democratization of the party and abandonment of the [[Stalinism|Stalinist]] line. Atallah was expelled from the party on September 26 of that year.<ref name="RCF" />

These activists and intellectuals who split from the LCP formed what would become the Democratic Left Movement.<ref name="Lebanon"> {{Cite | publisher = Carnegie Endowment for International Peace | last = Carnegie Endowment for International Peace | title = Arab Political Systems: Baseline Information and Reforms <U+2013> Lebanon | accessdate = 2009-07-04 | url = http://www.carnegieendowment.org/files/Lebanon_APS.doc }}</ref><ref name="influence" /> An initial "temporary preparatory committee" for the movement emerged, which issued statements highly critical of Syrian intervention in Lebanon and called for the birth of a new left.<ref name="meib2"> {{Cite conference | publisher = Daily Star | conference = Movement for a Democratic Left | last = "temporary preparatory committee" of the Movement for a Democratic Left | title = Movement for a Democratic Left | location = Beirut | accessdate = 2009-07-05 | date = 2004-02-04 | url = http://www.meib.org/documentfile/040204.htm }}</ref> In September 2004, the Democratic Left Movement was officially established.<ref name="Lebanon" /> On October 17, at a ceremony commemorating the foundation of the movement attended by figures across the political spectrum,<ref name="wire" /> Elias Atallah declared that the movement was founded on three principles: "<nowiki>[First]</nowiki>, we are preachers of real social and cultural change on the bases of democracy, national independence and reconciliation with the Arab nation and Arab nationalism.

Shortly after its foundation, the DLM, along with the [[Qornet Shehwan Gathering]], [[Democratic Renewal (Lebanon)|Democratic Renewal]], and  [[Democratic Gathering]] formed a "multi-party opposition" to oppose the constitutional amendment that extended the presidential term of [[Emile Lahoud]].<ref name="Front">{{cite web|url=http://www.lebanonwire.com/0410/04101608LW.asp|title=New front boosts opposition to Syria in Lebanon|date=2004-10-16|publisher=Lebanonwire.com|accessdate=2009-08-04}}</ref> The informal coalition, which called for preserving the constitution and defending the republic, appealed for free elections based on an equitable electoral law, curtailing corruption, fostering an independent judiciary, and reforming public administration.

In an interview with [[NOW Lebanon]], DLM Former Vice President Ziad Majed stated, "Georges Hawi [...] was trying to bring the communist party, or at least part of it, to join efforts with us [the DLM]."<ref name="Interview" />

==Structure and composition==

The DLM operates under a decentralized framework in which distinct currents are encouraged and represented in a national body.<ref name="Interview" /><ref name="structure" />   The movement's constituency elects a National Assembly, the principal decision-making institution, on the basis of proportional representation, where every current forms a list. Composed of no less than 51 and no more than 101 members, determined proportionately by the size of the constituency, it maintains political priorities, alliances, and rhetoric, and elects an Executive Committee of between 9 and 15 members for daily organizational activities on various issues. Other organizational bodies include the Legal Committee and Financial Committee. Internal elections occur every three years.<ref name="structure" /> 

In October 2004, a 77-member constituent assembly elected a 15-member Executive Committee in the movement's first session of internal elections. Those elected included [[Elias Atallah]] as General Secretary<ref name="Interview" /> (and leader),<ref name="Atallah" /> Nadim Abdel Samad as president, and Hikmat Eid, Anju Rihan, Ziad Majed and Ziad Saab as members.<ref name="wire" /> In April 2007, elections were again held to elect new members to the movement's National Assembly.<ref name="apdi"> {{Cite web | last = UNDP | title = Arab Parliaments: Arab Political Parties Database: Lebanon | work = Arab parliaments | accessdate = 2009-07-05 | date = 2007-12-15 | url = http://www.arabparliaments.org/countries/bycountry.asp?pid=9&cid=9 }}</ref> Two lists competed, one supported by Elias Atallah and representing the leadership's rhetoric at that time and the other current an all youth-bloc named Keep Left.<ref name="Interview" />  While Atallah was reelected leader of the movement,<ref name="Atallah" /> Keep Left attained 30% of the votes in Lebanon and 58% of those living outside the country who participated in an online poll, enabling all of the list to be elected to the national assembly.<ref name="Interview" /> Ziad Majed, former vice president of the DLM, and [[Elias Khoury]], a prominent and founding member, did not participate, citing personal matters as well as disagreements with party leadership.<ref name="Interview" />

{{Politics of Lebanon}}

==Political stances==
=== Ideology ===
The Democratic Left Movement supports a European-style [[social democracy]] to promote socioeconomic equality without hampering personal liberty or economic productivity.<ref name="Lebanon" /> In an interview with [[NOW Lebanon]], DLM Former Vice President Ziad Majed classified the movement as center-left economically.<ref name="Interview"> {{Cite interview | last = Hankir | first = Zahra | type = Now Lebanon | title = Talking To: Ziad Majed | accessdate = 2009-07-05 | date = 2008-01-01 | url = http://www.nowlebanon.com/NewsArticleDetails.aspx?ID=29714 }}</ref> However, he went on to say that the party adopted a decentralized model when founded to allow different viewpoints to coexist in which internal movements are encouraged and represented in a party-wide national body.<ref name="Interview" /> The political manifesto of the DLM identified the movement as "beyond the requirement of singularity of thought"<ref> {{lang-ar| <U+062A><U+062A><U+062C><U+0627><U+0648><U+0632> <U+0648><U+062D><U+062F><U+0627><U+0646><U+064A><U+0629> <U+0627><U+0644><U+0641><U+0643><U+0631>}}</ref> and open to leftists of all denominations.<ref name="manifesto">{{cite web|url=http://alyassar.org/ar/content/view/10/5/|title=The draft political document of the Democratic Left Movement|publisher=Democratic Left Movement|language=Arabic|accessdate=2009-07-25}}</ref>

=== Domestic policy ===
The DLM is one of a few parties to propose [[secularism|secularization]] of the Lebanese state.<ref name="Lebanon" /> This includes abolishing sectarian appropriation of public jobs,<ref name="apdi"/> replacing the [[Confessionalism (politics)|confessional]] parliamentary system with a modern, representative system,<ref name="Lebanon" /><ref name="apdi" /> and allowing civil marriages to be executed on Lebanese soil.<ref>{{Cite web | last = nowlebanon.com | title = Lebanese say pretend <U+201C>I do<U+2019>s<U+201D> in Valentine civil weddings | accessdate = 2009-07-09 | date = 2009-02-14 | url = http://www.nowlebanon.com/NewsArticleDetails.aspx?ID=79892 }}</ref> The movement appeals for general administrative reform throughout the public sector by means of a decentralization, modernization, and mechanization plan.<ref name="apdi"/>

In addition, the DLM defends human rights and calls for the respect of public freedoms and the [[rule of law]]. Listed within its platform is support for the marginalized and defense of [[equal opportunity]] for all Lebanese, regardless of religious or other personal affiliations. The DLM supports prohibiting the exploitation and discrimination of the physically or mentally disabled.<ref name="apdi"/>

=== Foreign policy===
The DLM calls for a unified and democratic Arab society which maintains the diversity of its components as well as the mutual interests of its people and states. The movement opposes foreign interference in Lebanese politics and supports correcting imbalanced relations with Syria.<ref name="apdi"/> Regarding the [[Shebaa_farms#The_current_dispute|Shebba farms dispute]], the party advocates resolving the identity of the territory through diplomatic means. If the farms are determined Lebanese, the cabinet should authorize their "liberation" either diplomatically or through the use of arms but through state institutions alone<ref name="Atallah" />  to enable the state to carry out its full role.<ref name="apdi"/> Moreover, concerning the broader [[Arab-Israeli Conflict]], the DLM appeals for the creation of a regional defense strategy which protects Lebanon<U+2019>s sovereignty from Israeli aggression while promoting the rights and interests of the region.<ref name="apdi"/>

== Electoral results ==
In the [[Lebanese general election, 2005|legislative elections]] of May and June 2005, the DLM won one seat<ref name="Canada"> {{Cite web | last = Research Directorate of the Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada | title = Issue Papers, Extended Responses and Country Fact Sheets__ Country Fact Sheet LEBANON November 2007 | work = Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada | format = Governmental | accessdate = 2009-07-05 | date = 2007 | url = http://www2.irb-cisr.gc.ca/en/research/ndp/ref/index_e.htm?docid=366&cid=0&sec=CH03 }}</ref> to become the first leftist, secular political party in the [[Lebanese Parliament]].<ref name="Atallah" /> Holding the Maronite seat<ref>Each religious community in Lebanon has an allotted number of seats in the Parliament.

== Criticism ==  
Criticism of the DLM arises from both inside and outside the party. Internally, Ziad Majed, a former DLM vice president, admonished the movement's current leadership for failing to act independently of the [[March 14 Alliance]] or develop and lobby for alternatives to the status quo.
