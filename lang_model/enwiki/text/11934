==Biography==
Humbert Roque Versace was born in [[Honolulu, Hawaii]] on [[July 2]], [[1937]].  He was the eldest of five children born to [[Marie Teresa Rios]] (1917<U+2013>1999) &mdash; the author of three books, including the ''Fifteenth Pelican'', on which ''[[The Flying Nun]]'' (starring [[Sally Field]]), the [[TV series]] of the 1960s, was based &mdash; and Colonel Humbart Joseph Versace (1911<U+2013>1972).<ref>[http://www.arlingtoncemetery.net/mtrversace.htm  Arlington National Cemetery Website]</ref>

Versace grew up in [[Alexandria, Virginia]] and attended Gonzaga College High School in [[Washington, D.C.]]. He joined the [[U.S. Armed Forces|Armed Forces]] in [[Norfolk, Virginia]]. As had his father before him, Versace entered the [[United States Military Academy|United States Military Academy West Point]]. He graduated in 1959 and was commissioned a [[Second Lieutenant]] of [[Armoured forces|Armor]] in the U.S. Army.<ref>[http://www.touchthewall.org/Rocky.html  My MIA's]</ref>

He was a member of [[Ranger School|Ranger]] Class 4-60 and was awarded the [[Ranger Tab]] on [[December 18]], [[1959]]. Upon graduation from [[Ranger School]], Capt. Versace attended [[Airborne School]] and was awarded the parachutist badge. He then served with 3rd Battalion, 40th Armor, [[1st Cavalry Division]] in the [[Republic of Korea]] as an [[M48 Patton#The M48|M-48 tank]] [[platoon leader]] from March 1960 to April 1961. Captain Versace was then assigned to the [[3rd United States Infantry Regiment (TOG)|3d U.S. Infantry (Old Guard)]], where he served as a tank platoon leader in Headquarters and  Headquarters Company. After volunteering for duty in Vietnam, he  attended the Military Assistance Institute, the Intelligence course at Fort Holabird, Maryland, and the USACS Vietnamese language Course at the [[Presidio of San Francisco]].<ref>[http://www.mishalov.com/Versace.html The Washington Post - Honoring the Defiant One]</ref> 

On [[May 12]], [[1962]], Versace began his first tour of duty in the [[Republic of Vietnam]] as an intelligence advisor. In May 1963 he volunteered for a six month's extension of his tour, planning to attend seminary at the conclusion of his service and join the Catholic priesthood, hoping to return to Vietnam as a missionary working with orphans.<ref name=VersacePlaza>{{cite web

Less than two weeks before the end of his tour, on [[October 29]], [[1963]], while acting as intelligence advisor to Detachment A-23, [[United States Army Special Forces#Organization|5th Special Forces Group]] in the [[Mekong Delta]], Versace accompanied several companies of South Vietnamese Civilian Irregular Defense ([[Civilian Irregular Defense Group|CIDG]]) troops who had planned to take out a [[Viet Cong]] (VC) command post located in the U Minh Forest, a Viet Cong stronghold. A [[VC Main Force]] battalion ambushed and overran Versace's unit, wounding him in the process.  He was able to provide enough covering fire so that the CIDG forces could withdraw from the killing zone.<ref>[http://www.mishalov.com/Versace.html Top Marine Endorses Medal of Honor for Army Hero Jul 18, 2000]</ref>

A second government force of about 200 men operating only a few thousand yards from the main fight learned of the disaster too late to help.  U.S. authorities said the communist radio jammers had knocked out both the main channel and the alternate channel on all local military radios.<ref>[http://www.homeofheroes.com/profiles/profiles_versace.html Pacific Stars and Stripes]</ref>

Versace was captured and taken to a prison deep in the jungle along with two other Americans, Lieutenant [[James N. Rowe|Nick Rowe]] and Sergeant [[Dan Pitzer]].<ref>{{cite news

Versace insulted the Viet Cong during the indoctrination sessions and cited the [[Geneva Convention]] treaty time after time. The Viet Cong separated Versace from the other prisoners. The last time the prisoners heard his voice, he was loudly singing "[[God Bless America]]".  On [[September 26]], [[1965]], North Vietnam<U+2019>s "Liberation Radio<U+201D> announced the execution of Captain Humbert Roque Versace.

Versace's remains have never been recovered. His headstone at [[Arlington National Cemetery]] stands above an empty grave.

Upon learning of their son's fate, Marie Teresa Rios Versace and her husband, Colonel Versace, tried to find out what they could about the circumstances. She went to Paris in the late 1960s, trying unsuccessfully to see the North Vietnamese delegation as it arrived for peace talks. Rios Versace expressed her frustration and anguish in poems.<ref>[http://www.mishalov.com/Versace.html A Mission Inspired By a POW's Persistence]</ref>

Nominations to award Versace the Medal of Honor were initiated in 1969, but the nomination failed and he was posthumously awarded the [[Silver Star Medal]] instead. The quest for a Medal of Honor for Versace languished until the "Friends of Rocky Versace" reinitiated the crusade once more in 1999. Language added by Congress in the 2002 [[Defense Authorization Act]] ended the standoff and authorized the award of the nation's highest military decoration for combat valor to Versace.<ref>[http://www.mishalov.com/Versace.html  The Washington Times July 4, 2002]</ref>

On [[July 8]], [[2002]], in a ceremony in the [[White House]] East Room, Versace was posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor by [[George W. Bush|President George W. Bush]] for his heroism, the first time an Army POW had been awarded the nation's highest honor for actions in captivity. Present were his surviving siblings, Dr. Stephen, [[Dick Versace|Richard]] (former coach of the [[Indiana Pacers]]), Michael and Trilby Versace.<ref>[http://www.mishalov.com/Versace.html   President Awards Posthumous Medal of Honor to Vietnam War Hero]</ref>

==Medal of Honor citation==
<blockquote>'''Humbert Roque Versace'''<br>
Rank and organization: Captain, U.S. Army, Intelligence Advisor, Special Operations<br>
Place and date: Republic of Vietnam. <br>
Entered service at: Norfolk, Virginia Birth: Honolulu, Hawaii<br>

Citation:"For conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity at the risk of his life above and beyond the call of duty while a prisoner of war during the period of [[29 October]] [[1963]] to [[26 September]] [[1965]] in the Republic of Vietnam. While accompanying a Civilian Irregular Defense Group patrol engaged in combat operations in Thoi Binh District, An Xuyen Province, Republic of Vietnam on [[29 October]] [[1963]], Captain Versace and the CIDG assault force were caught in an ambush from intense [[mortar (weapon)|mortar]], [[automatic weapon]]s, and [[small arms]] fire from elements of a reinforced enemy Main Force battalion. As the battle raged, Captain Versace fought valiantly and encouraged his CIDG patrol to return fire against overwhelming enemy forces. He provided covering fire from an exposed position to enable friendly forces to withdraw from the killing zone when it was apparent that their position would be overrun, and was severely wounded in the knee and back from automatic weapons fire and [[shrapnel]]. He stubbornly resisted capture with the last full measure of his strength and ammunition. Taken prisoner by the Viet Cong, he demonstrated exceptional leadership and resolute adherence to the tenets of the Code of Conduct from the time he entered into a prisoner of war status. Captain Versace assumed command of his fellow American prisoners, and despite being kept locked in irons in an [[isolation box]], raised their morale by singing messages to popular songs of the day, and leaving inspiring messages at the latrine. Within three weeks of captivity, and despite the severity of his untreated wounds, he attempted the first of four escape attempts by dragging himself on his hands and knees out of the camp through dense swamp and forbidding vegetation to freedom. Crawling at a very slow pace due to his weakened condition, the guards quickly discovered him outside the camp and recaptured him. Captain Versace scorned the enemy's exhaustive interrogation and indoctrination efforts, and inspired his fellow prisoners to resist to the best of their ability. When he used his Vietnamese language skills to protest improper treatment of the American prisoners by the guards, he was put into leg irons and gagged to keep his protestations out of earshot of the other American prisoners in the camp. The last time that any of his fellow prisoners heard from him, Captain Versace was singing God Bless America at the top of his voice from his isolation box. Unable to break his indomitable will, his faith in God, and his trust in the United States of America and his fellow prisoners, Captain Versace was executed by the Viet Cong on [[26 September]] [[1965]]. Captain Versaces extraordinary heroism, self-sacrifice, and personal bravery involving conspicuous risk of life above and beyond the call of duty were in keeping with the highest traditions of the United States Army, and reflect great credit to himself and the U.S. Armed Forces."<ref>[http://www.homeofheroes.com/moh/citations_1960_vn/versace.htm Medal of Honor Citation]</ref></blockquote>
