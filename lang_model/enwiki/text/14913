==Construction==
On March 31, 1793, the U.S. Commissioners in charge of selling federally-owned lots in the District of Columbia agreed to sell square 221 to Samuel Davidson.<ref name="Cosmos" /> Davidson died in 1810, and son and two daughters inherited the property.<ref name="Cosmos" /> Richard Cutts purchased lots 12, 13, 14 and 15 of square 221 from the Davidson heirs on October 3, 1818.<ref name="Cosmos" />

The house itself was constructed in 1818-1819 by Richard Cutts, who built the house for himself and his wife, Anna Payne Cutts (Dolley Payne Madison's sister).<ref name="Miller">Miller, Albert D.

The city gravelled the street in front of the house in 1823.<ref name="Bryan" />

==Occupants==
===Dolley Madison===
Cutts secured a mortgaged to build the house, and on August 22, 1828, the bank holding the mortgage sold it to ex-[[President of the United States|President]] [[James Madison]] for $5,750.<ref name="Miller" /><ref name="Peacock" /><ref name="Wentzel">Wentzel, Volkmar Kurt.

ISBN 1560729309</ref><ref name="Peacock" /> Her husband's death had left Dolley Madison in a financially difficult position, so to reduce her expenses she took up residency in the house in November 1837.<ref name="Miller" /><ref name="Allgor" /><ref name="Bednar" /><ref name="Smith" /><ref name="Cote" /><ref name="Peacock" /> Presidents [[James Monroe]], [[John Quincy Adams]], [[Andrew Jackson]], [[Martin Van Buren]], [[William Henry Harrison]], [[John Tyler]], [[James K. Polk]], and [[Zachary Taylor]] all visited her in the home, as did [[John C. Calhoun]], [[Henry Clay]], and [[Daniel Webster]].<ref name="Peacock" /> Dolley Madison's financial difficulties continued. She continued to own [[Montpelier (Orange, Virginia)|Montpelier]], her husband's country estate and farm in the [[Piedmont (United States)|Piedmont]] of [[Virginia]]. But Montpelier's finances were in poor condition, and Dolley moved out of the Cutts-Madison House in 1839 to live once more at Montpelier and see if she could save the estate.<ref name="Allgor" /><ref name="Cote" /> She rented out the Cutts-Madison house, but was unable to stabilize Montpelier.<ref name="Allgor" /><ref name="Cote" /> She moved back to the Cutts-Madison House in 1843, and sold Montpelier in 1844.<ref name="Allgor" /><ref name="Cote" />

In 1844 or 1845, after her return to the Cutts-Madison House, [[arson]]ists put lit matches into the shutters in the rear of the house, and Dolley Madison had to be wakened and saved from death by a servant.<ref name="Cutts">Madison, Dolley. ''Memoirs and Letters of Dolly Madison: Wife of James Madison, President of the United States.'' 2d ed. Lucia Beverly Cutts, ed. New York: Houghton, Mifflin and Company, 1887.</ref> The fire was quickly put out, and the damage to the building not extensive (Mrs. Madison returned to her bedroom the same night).<ref name="Cutts" />

Dolley Madison lived in the house on Lafayette Square until her death on July 12, 1849.<ref name="Bednar" /><ref name="Smith" /> Her only surviving child, John Payne Todd (from her first marriage to [[Religious Society of Friends|Quaker]] lawyer John Todd), inherited the property.<ref name="Cosmos" /> On April 3, 1851, Todd sold the house and property to Charles Wilkes.<ref name="Cosmos" />

===Charles Wilkes===
[[Rear Admiral]] [[Charles Wilkes]] purchased the home in 1851.<ref name="Smith" /><ref name="Wentzel" /><ref name="Washburn">Washburn, Wilcomb E. ''The Cosmos Club of Washington: A Centennial History, 1878-1978.'' Washington, D.C.: The Club, 1978.</ref><ref>Symonds, Craig L. ''Lincoln and His Admirals.'' New York: Oxford University Press US, 2008. ISBN 0195310225</ref> Wilkes moved the entrance from Madison Place NW to H Street NW, and turned the porch on the west side of the house (facing Madison Place NW) into a window.<ref name="Smith" /><ref name="Washburn" /> The gable roof (which sloped east and west) was eliminated and a flat roof installed, an out-building added in the rear, and a bay window added on the south side.<ref name="Cosmos" /> Wilkes also cut all windows on the first floor down so that they now reached the floor.<ref name="Cosmos" />

During the 1850s and 1860s, the house had a number of notable occupants in addition to the Wilkeses.

After being named Special Envoy to Central America, Sir [[William Gore Ouseley]] rented the house in 1858 on his way to the region and entertained lavishly while living there.<ref>Poore, Benjamin Perley. ''Perley's Reminiscences of Sixty Years in the National Metropolis.'' Philadelphia, Pa.: Hubbard Brothers, 1886.</ref> General George B. McClellan used the house as his Washington-based headquarters after the [[First Battle of Bull Run]] during the [[American Civil War|Civil War]].<ref name="Miller" /><ref name="Smith" /><ref name="Carrier" /> McClellan first occupied the house on July 26, 1861, and left in late October for new headquarters at a house at the corner of [[H Street (Washington, D.C.)|H Street NW]] and 15th Street NW (where the Sofitel Lafayette Square Hotel now stands).<ref name="Cosmos" /> After the Civil War, the Cutts-Madison House was briefly used by the French Claims Commission.<ref name="Smith" />

Wilkes mortgaged in the house in 1855, and the mortgage passed through several hands over the next 15 years until George B. Warren secured it in 1870.<ref name="Cosmos" /> Upon his death in 1880, the mortgage was assigned to his daughter, Phebe Warren Tayloe.<ref name="Cosmos" /> She died in 1882, and her neice Elizabeth H. Price came to hold the mortgage.<ref name="Cosmos" /> Price sold the mortgage in December 1884 to Edward Tayloe Perry (a minor).<ref name="Cosmos" /> Meanwhile, Charles Wilkes deeded the house over to his wife and three daughters in 1870.<ref name="Cosmos" /> Wilkes died in 1877, and in 1886 the Wilkes family sold the house to the [[Cosmos Club]] for the sum of $40,000 (which sum paid the outstanding mortgage held in trust for Edward Tayloe Perry).<ref name="Cosmos" />

===Cosmos Club===
[[File:Cutts-MadisonHouse CosmosClubrenovations1886.jpg|thumb|left|Plans for the renovations of the first floor of the Cutts-Madison House, made by the Cosmos Club in 1886.]]
The Cosmos Club raised the height of the third floor by raising the roof, and added a large meeting hall by building a single-story 23'8" (7.21 metre) extension to the south side of the house (with [[skylight]]).<ref name="Cosmos" /><ref name="Carrier" /><ref name="Wentzel" /> The Cosmos Club made further improvements in 1893.  Electricity was installed, the heating system upgraded, and general refurbishing of commons areas completed.<ref name="Cosmos" />  Two additional stories were built over the assembly hall: The second story consisting of one large room, and a third story consisting of four meeting rooms.<ref name="Cosmos" /> A bathroom was added to the third floor of the old building, above the existing second-floor bathroom.<ref name="Cosmos" />

The eastern garden was removed, and a three-story addition built. The addition consisted of a ground floor with an entrance to the building on H Street NW, a [[cloakroom]], and a connecting door to the assembly hall on the south side of the building; a second story with meeting rooms for the Cosmos Club as well as other societies which might use the premises; and a third story with lodgings and a meeting room for the Cosmos Club's Board of Directors.<ref name="Cosmos" /> The basement of the original building was renovated and upgraded to include a kitchen, a bathroom, and an underground passage to the new addition.<ref name="Cosmos" /> The goal of building the addition was to permit visiting societies (such as members of the [[National Geographic Society]]) to enter and use the building without disturbing members of the Cosmos Club.<ref name="Wentzel" /> The total cost of the renovations was $15,000.<ref name="Cosmos" /> Hornblower & Marshall were the architects of the addition, which was completed in January 1894.<ref name="Cosmos" />

In 1903, the Cosmos Club purchased from Henry Reed Rathbone for $33,000 No. 25 Madison Place NW, the building immediately to the south of the Cutts-Madison House (against which its three-story assembly hall addition abutted).<ref name="Cosmos" /> This property (and the one to the south of it) were razed in 1909, and a five-story Cosmos Club lodging house built.<ref name="Bednar" />

The Cosmos Club vacated the property in 1952 to move to new headquarters in the Townsend Mansion at 2121 Massachusetts Avenue NW,<ref name="Benedetto" /> at which time the Cutts-Madison House was purchased by the U.S. government and used for offices.<ref name="Carrier" /><ref name="Wentzel" /><ref>At least one source incorrectly places the dislocation of the Cosmos Club from the Cutts-Madison House in 1939.  See: Bednar, ''L'Enfant's Legacy: Public Open Spaces in Washington,'' 2006, p. 105.</ref>

In 1900, the [[United States Congress]] passed a resolution establishing the U.S. Senate Park Commission (also known as the "McMillan Commission" because it was chaired by [[United States Senate|Senator]] [[James McMillan (politician)|James McMillan]] <nowiki>[</nowiki>[[Republican Party (United States)|R]]-[[Michigan|Mich.]]<nowiki>])</nowiki>.<ref name="Peterson">Peterson, Jon A.

[[William Wilson Corcoran]]'s [[Corcoran House]] at 1615 H Street NW was torn down in 1922 and replaced with the Neoclassical [[United States Chamber of Commerce]] headquarters.<ref name="Luria" /><ref name="Goode" /> The [[Hay-Adams Houses]] were razed in 1927 by [[real estate developer]] [[Harry Wardman]], and the [[Hay<U+2013>Adams Hotel]] built on the site.<ref name="Goode">Goode, James W.

Opposition to the demolition of the Cutts-Madison House and other buildings on Lafayette Square began forming shortly after the plan to raze the structures was announced. Senators [[James E. Murray]] and [[Wayne Morse]], several members of the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]], and citizens of the District of Columbia lobbied to defeat the legislation authorizing the demolition of the buildings.<ref>"3 Historic Buildings Befriended."

''Designing Camelot: The Kennedy White House Restoration.'' Hoboken, N.J.: John Wiley and Sons, 1997. ISBN 0471292427</ref>

Warnecke's design was based on the [[architectural theory]] of contextualism, where modern buildings are harmonized with the urban forms usual to a traditional city.<ref>Jencks, Charles. ''New Paradigm In Architecture.'' 7th ed. New Haven, Conn.: Yale University Press, 2002. ISBN 0300095120</ref> Not only did Warnecke's design build the first modern buildings on Lafayette Square, but they were the first buildings in the city to utilize contextualism as a design philosphy.<ref name="Bednar" /> Warnecke's design for the [[Howard T. Markey National Courts Building|National Courts Building]] was to create tall, flat structures in red brick which would serve as relatively unobtrusive backgrounds to the lighter-colored residential homes like the Cutts-Madison House.<ref name="Bednar" /> The Cutts-Madison House, Cosmos Club building, and Benjamin Ogle Tayloe House were joined, and a courtyard built between them and the National Courts building.<ref name="Bednar" />

The Cutts-Madison House has remained part of the court building ever since.
