The '''[[1987 NFL season|1987]] [[Cleveland Browns]] season''' was the team's 38<sup>th</sup> season with the [[National Football League]].

Led by another 3,000-yard season by [[Bernie Kosar]], the Browns captured their third straight AFC Central crown. In the divisional playoffs, against the [[Indianapolis Colts]] at Municipal Stadium, the Browns have no problem advancing to their 2nd straight AFC Championship Game as they rout the Colts 38-21. For the 2nd year in a row the Browns are matched up against the [[Denver Broncos]] for a trip to [[Super Bowl XXII]]. The Browns would fall behind early at [[Mile High Stadium]], as the Broncos roared out to a big halftime lead. However, the Browns roar back scoring 30 points in the 2nd half, and driving for the winning TD in the final 2 minutes. However, the Browns dreams would come up just a few yards short as RB [[Earnest Byner]] fumbles at the goal line (the play would simply be call [[The Fumble]]) as the Browns fall 38-33.
