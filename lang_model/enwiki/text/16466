'''''V for Vendetta''''' is a [[2006 in film|2006]] [[action movie|action]]-[[Thriller (genre)|thriller]] film set in [[London]], [[England]] in a near-future [[dystopia|dystopian]] society. The film follows the mysterious [[V (comics)|V]], a [[freedom fighter]] seeking to effect [[sociopolitical]] change while simultaneously pursuing his own violent personal [[vendetta]]. The film is an adaptation of the graphic novel ''[[V for Vendetta]]'' by [[Alan Moore]] and [[David Lloyd (comic artist)|David Lloyd]]. ''V for Vendetta'' was [[film director|directed]] by [[James McTeigue]] and produced by [[Joel Silver]] and the [[The Wachowski brothers|Wachowski brothers]], who also wrote the [[screenplay]]. The film stars [[Natalie Portman]] as [[Evey Hammond]], [[Hugo Weaving]] as V, [[Stephen Rea]] as [[Eric Finch|Inspector Finch]], and [[John Hurt]] as [[Adam Susan|Chancellor Sutler]]. 

The film's release was originally scheduled for Friday, [[November 4]], [[2005]] (a day before the 400th [[Guy Fawkes Night]]), but was delayed; it opened on [[March 17]], [[2006]], and was generally well-received by critics and audiences alike. Alan Moore, facing his disappointment in both ''[[From Hell (film)|From Hell]]'' and ''[[The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen (film)|The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen]]'', refused to view the film and subsequently distanced himself from it. The filmmakers removed some of the [[anarchist]] themes and [[illegal drugs|drug]] references present in the original story and also updated the political message to be more relevant to a 2006 audience. Due to the politically sensitive content of the film, ''V for Vendetta'' attracted much attention from groups on both sides of the political spectrum and has received both great praise and harsh criticism in turn.

==Plot==

<!-- Please do not add the date 2020 to the time of the film.  It has largely been agreed upon that that is not the correct date, it's closer to 2040 (The Salt Flats film was in 2015, followed by Valerie's 3 years of happiness with her lover, followed by an unknown time in Larkhill, followed by 20 years of V's work after the fire in Larkhill). Also, please add no more images in here! -->
{{spoilers}}
The story is set in the near future (approximately [[2038]]) with Britain ruled by a [[totalitarian]] regime called [[Norsefire]]. It follows Evey Hammond (Natalie Portman), a young woman who is rescued from the Fingermen (secret policemen who were arresting her for being out after curfew and stating the intention to rape her) by a man wearing a [[Guy Fawkes]] mask, the vigilante known as "V" (Hugo Weaving). After rescuing her, V takes Evey to a rooftop location to witness his spectacular destruction of the [[Old Bailey]]. The regime explains the incident to the public as a planned demolition, but this is shown to be a lie when V takes over the state-run TV station later that day. V broadcasts a message urging the people of Britain to rise up and stand with him at the [[Palace of Westminster|Houses of Parliament]] on [[November 5]], one year from that day. V implies that on that date he will destroy the Houses of Parliament.

Evey, who works at the British Television Network, helps V escape. V takes Evey to his lair, the Shadow Gallery, where she is told she must stay in hiding with him for her own safety. Upon learning that V is killing government officials, she is horrified and disgusted with V's actions, vowing to escape from him. In an effort to escape from the Shadow Gallery, she briefly explains her past to V and inquires as to whether there is anything she could do to help. Later, he devises a plan to infiltrate the bedroom of a lecherous bishop, which requires Evey's assistance. Evey attempts to betray V's plot to the bishop, but he does not believe her. After V appears, Evey escapes to the home of one of her superiors from BTN, Gordon Deitrich ([[Stephen Fry]]), who reveals to her that he is a closet homosexual and collector of banned art and literature. When Gordon makes a last minute change to a TV programme he is hosting, satirizing the High Chancellor, the Fingermen (secret police) raid Gordon's home and attack and arrest him. Evey is captured, incarcerated and tortured for days, finding solace only in the notes left by a previous prisoner named Valerie, who was imprisoned and persecuted for being a lesbian. Evey is told that she will be executed unless she reveals V's whereabouts or identity; she declares that she would rather die, and finds herself released. Evey discovers that she has been in the Shadow Gallery all along, her imprisonment staged by V, who is sorry to inform her that Gordon was executed. By forcing Evey to endure something similar to what he had endured at [[Larkhill]] detention center, V hoped that Evey would understand that "integrity", "the very last inch of us", is more important than our lives. Evey initially hates V for what he has done, but comes to realize that the experience allows life without fear and for her to return to a normal life in London. She leaves V, promising to return before [[November 5]].
[[Image:Vforvendettapubh.jpg|300px|thumb|left|V and Evey Hammond in the Shadow Gallery. Evey is taken there after their escape from the BTN.]]

Meanwhile, Inspector Finch (Stephen Rea), investigating V, learns how Norsefire came to power, and about V<U+2019>s origins through some unsettling information. Fourteen years previously, Britain had suffered from war and terrorism. The ultra-conservative Norsefire party led a reactionary purge to restore order; so-called enemies of the state disappeared overnight. The country, deeply divided over the loss of freedom, found itself united by a [[bioterrorism|bioterrorist]] attack that killed 80,000 people. The fear generated by the attack allowed Norsefire to silence all opposition and win the next election by a landslide. A cure for the virus released during the attack was discovered soon thereafter. With the silent consent of the people, Norsefire turned Britain into a bigoted totalitarian order, with their leader Adam Sutler (John Hurt) as High Chancellor. However, the viral catastrophe was itself engineered by Norsefire as a plot to gain power. The virus had been engineered through deadly experimentation on "social deviants" and political dissidents at Larkhill detention center. V had been one of the prisoners, but rather than being killed by the experiments he gained heightened mental and physical abilities. V was the only survivor of the 48 subjects of the experiment. He eventually escaped the center by blowing it up from his cell, vowing to take revenge on Norsefire's regime.

As [[November 5]] nears, V's various schemes cause chaos in Britain, as the population grows more and more rebellious and [[Subversion (political)|subversive]] toward government authority. On the eve of [[November 5]], V is again visited by Evey, and shows her a train which he has filled with explosives in order to destroy Parliament via the abandoned [[London Underground]]. He delegates the destruction of Parliament to Evey, believing that the ultimate decision should not come from him, but rather from a member of the public he is trying to liberate. V departs to meet Party leader Creedy, who has agreed to deliver the Chancellor to V in exchange for V's surrender: V had manipulated Finch into putting heavy police surveillance on Creedy, and fooled Creedy into thinking that Sutler had ordered it, preparing for Creedy to take the blame should Sutler's regime ever fall. Creedy kills the whimpering Chancellor in front of V with a simple gunshot to the head, but V does not surrender, instead killing Creedy and his men. V, mortally wounded by gunfire, returns to Evey. He thanks her and professes his love for her before dying. His body is placed upon the train with the explosives, reminiscent of a [[Viking funeral]].

Evey is about to send the train down the track when she is discovered by Inspector Finch. Finch, having learned much about the corruption of the Norsefire regime, allows Evey to proceed. Meanwhile, hundreds of thousands of Londoners, all wearing Guy Fawkes masks, march on Parliament to watch the event. Because Creedy and the Chancellor are dead, the military stands down in the face of a civil rebellion. The Houses of Parliament, like Old Bailey, are destroyed by a series of explosions while [[Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky|Tchaikovsky]]'s ''[[1812 Overture]]'' plays on public [[loudspeaker]]s. On a nearby rooftop, Evey and Finch watch the scene together and hope for a better tomorrow.

==Development==
The film was made by many of the same filmmakers involved in [[The Matrix series|the ''Matrix'' trilogy]].  In 1988, producer Joel Silver acquired the rights to two of Alan Moore's works: ''V for Vendetta'' and ''[[Watchmen]]''.<ref name="vendettasite">{{cite web | title=V for Vendetta news | publisher=Warner Brothers | work=vforvendetta.com | url=http://vforvendetta.warnerbros.com/index2.html | accessmonthday=31 March |accessyear=2006}}</ref> The Wachowski brothers were fans of ''V for Vendetta'' and in the mid-1990s, before working on ''[[The Matrix]]'', wrote a draft screenplay that closely followed the graphic novel. During the post-production of the second and third ''Matrix'' films, the Wachowski brothers revisited the screenplay and offered the director's role to [[James McTeigue]]. All three were intrigued by the themes of the original story and found them to be relevant to the current political landscape. Upon revisiting the screenplay, the Wachowskis set about making revisions to condense and modernize the story, while at the same time attempting to preserve its integrity and themes.<ref name="official production">{{cite web | title=Production Notes for V for Vendetta | work=official webpage | publisher=vforvendetta.com | url=http://vforvendetta.warnerbros.com/cmp/prod_notes_ch_02.html | accessmonthday=14 April | accessyear=2006}}</ref>  James McTeigue cites the film ''[[The Battle of Algiers]]'' as his principle influence in preparing to film ''V for Vendetta''.<ref name="official production" />

Moore explicitly disassociated himself from the film due to his lack of involvement in its writing or directing, as well as due to a continuing series of disputes over film adaptations of his work.<ref name="IGN">{{cite news |last=Goldstein |first=Hilary  |url=http://comics.ign.com/articles/696/696867p1.html |title=V for Vendetta: Comic vs. Film |publisher=IGN.com |date=2006-03-17 |accessdate=2007-01-13}}</ref>  He ended cooperation with his publisher, [[DC Comics]], after its corporate parent, [[Warner Bros.]], failed to retract statements about Moore's supposed endorsement of the film. Moore said that the script contained plot holes<ref name="comicbookresource">{{cite news |last=Johnston |first=Rich |url=http://comicbookresources.com/columns/index.cgi?column=litg&article=2153 |title=MOORE SLAMS V FOR VENDETTA MOVIE, PULLS LoEG FROM DC COMICS |publisher=comicbookresources.com |date=2005-05-23 |accessdate=2006-01-03}}</ref> and that it ran contrary to the theme of his original work, which was to place two political extremes ([[fascism]] and [[anarchism]]) against one another. He argues his work had been recast as a story about "current [[neoconservatism|American neo-conservatism]] vs. current [[American liberalism]]".<ref name="mooreinterview">{{cite news |last=MacDonald |first=Heidi |url=http://www.comicon.com/thebeat/2006/03/a_for_alan_pt_1_the_alan_moore.html |title=A FOR ALAN, Pt. 1: The Alan Moore interview |publisher=GIANT Magazine |date=2006-03-15 |accessdate=2007-01-03}}</ref>  As per his wishes, Moore's name does not appear in the film's closing credits. Co-creator and illustrator [[David Lloyd (comic artist)|David Lloyd]] supports the film adaptation, commenting that the script is very good and that Moore would only ever be truly happy with a complete book-to-screen adaptation.<ref name="vendettasite"/>

==Production==
''V for Vendetta'' was filmed in London, [[United Kingdom|UK]] and in [[Potsdam]], [[Germany]] at [[Babelsberg Studios]]. Much of the film was shot on [[sound stage]]s and indoor sets, with location work done in [[Berlin]] for three scenes: the Norsefire rally flashback, Larkhill, and Bishop Lilliman<U+2019>s bedroom. The scenes that took place in the abandoned [[London Underground]] were filmed at the disused [[Aldwych tube station]]. Filming began in early March, 2005, and principal photography officially wrapped in early June of 2005.<ref name="vendettasite"/> ''V for Vendetta'' is the final film shot by [[cinematographer]] [[Adrian Biddle]], who died of a heart attack on [[December 7]] [[2005]].

The film was designed to have a future-retro look, with a heavy use of grey tones to give a dreary, stagnant feel to totalitarian London. The largest set created for the film was the Shadow Gallery, which was made to feel like a cross between a crypt and an [[undercroft]].<ref name="Unmasked">{{cite visual | crew=Warner Bros | date=2006 | url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0775408 | title=V for Vendetta Unmasked | medium=TV-Special | location=United States|distributor=Warner Bros.}}</ref>  The Gallery is V's home as well as the place where he stores various artifacts forbidden by the government.  Some of the works of art displayed in the gallery include ''[[The Arnolfini Portrait]]'' by [[Jan van Eyck]], ''[[Bacchus and Ariadne]]'' by [[Titian]], a ''[[Mildred Pierce (film)|Mildred Pierce]]'' poster, ''St. Sebastian'' by Andrea Mantegna and ''[[The Lady of Shalott]]'' by [[John William Waterhouse]].

One of the major challenges in the film was how to bring V to life from under an expressionless mask.  Thus, considerable effort was made to bring together lighting, acting and Weaving's voice to create the proper mood for the situation.  In order to prevent the mask from muffling Weaving's voice, a microphone was placed in his hairline to aid post-production, when his entire dialogue was re-recorded.<ref name="About the Production">{{cite web | work=Official Website | title=V for Vendetta - About the production | url=http://vforvendetta.warnerbros.com/cmp/prod_notes_ch_03.html | accessmonthday=4 January | accessyear=2007}}</ref>

To film the final scene at [[Westminster]], the area from [[Trafalgar Square]] and [[Whitehall]] up to Parliament and [[Clock Tower, Palace of Westminster|Big Ben]] had to be closed for three nights from midnight until 5 a.m. This was the first time the security-sensitive area (home to [[10 Downing Street]] and the [[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Defence]]) had ever been closed to accommodate filming.<ref name="About the Production" />  Prime Minister [[Tony Blair]]'s son [[Euan Blair]] worked on the film's production and is said (according to an interview with Stephen Fry) to have helped the filmmakers obtain the unparalleled filming access. This drew criticism of Blair from [[Member of Parliament|MP]] [[David Davis (British politician)|David Davis]] due to the content of the film. However, the makers of the film deny Euan Blair's involvement in the deal,<ref name="tony blair's son">{{cite web | publisher=The Guardian | title=How E got the V in Vendetta | url=http://film.guardian.co.uk/news/story/0,,1737806,00.html | date=March 23, 2006 | accessmonthday=13 May | accessyear=2006}}</ref> stating that access was acquired through nine months of negotiations with 14 different government departments and agencies.<ref name="About the Production" />

==Publicity and release==
[[Image:Natalie Portman at Comic Con5 2005b.jpg|thumb|280px|right|Natalie Portman speaking at the 2005 [[Comic-Con|San Diego Comic-Con]].]]
The cast and film-makers attended several press conferences that allowed them to address issues surrounding the film, including its authenticity, Alan Moore's reaction to it and its intended political message.  The responses given at the conferences made it clear that the film was intended to be a departure from some of Moore's original themes. In the words of Hugo Weaving: "Alan Moore was writing about something which happened some time ago. It was a response to living in [[Margaret Thatcher|Thatcherite]] England...  This is a response to the world in which we live today. So I think that the film and the graphic novel are two separate entities." Regarding the controversial political content in the film the filmmakers have said that the film is intended more to raise questions and add to a dialogue already present in society, rather than provide answers or tell viewers what to think".<ref name="v for vendetta interviews"/>

The film takes extensive imagery from the infamous 1605 [[Gunpowder Plot]], where a group of [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]] conspirators plotted to destroy the Houses of Parliament in order to spark a revolution in England.<ref name="vendettasite"/>  The film was originally scheduled for release on the weekend of [[November 5]] [[2005]], the 400th anniversary of the Plot, with the tag line "Remember, remember the 5th of November", taken from a traditional British rhyme memorialising the event.  However, the marketing angle lost much of its value when the release date was pushed back to [[March 17]] [[2006]].  Many have speculated that the delay was due to the London tube bombings on [[7 July 2005 London bombings|July 7]] and [[21 July 2005 London bombings|21]].  The film-makers have denied this, saying that the delays were from the need for more time in order to finish the visual effects production.<ref name="Postponed">{{cite web | publisher=sfgate.com | title=Natalie Portman's 'V For Vendetta' Postponed | url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/blogs/sfgate/detail?blogid=7&entry_id=452 | accessmonthday=25 April |accessyear=2006}}</ref> ''V for Vendetta'' had its first major premiere on [[February 13]] at the [[Berlin Film Festival]].<ref name="v for vendetta interviews"/>  It opened for general release on [[March 17]] [[2006]] in 3,365 theatres in the [[United States]], the United Kingdom and six other countries.<ref name="boxofficemojo"/>

==Music==
{{main | V for Vendetta (soundtrack)}}
The ''V for Vendetta'' [[film soundtrack|soundtrack]] was released by [[Astralwerks|Astralwerks Records]] on [[March 21]] [[2006]].  The original scores from the film's composer, [[Dario Marianelli]], make up most of the tracks on the album.  The soundtrack also features three vocals played during the film: "[[Cry Me a River (Arthur Hamilton song)|Cry Me a River]]" by [[Julie London]], a cover of [[The Velvet Underground]] song "I Found a Reason" by [[Cat Power]] and "Bird Gerhl" by [[Antony and the Johnsons]].  As mentioned in the film, these songs are samples of the 872 [[Blacklisted#Political context|blacklisted]] tracks on V's [[Wurlitzer|Wurlitzer jukebox]] that V "reclaimed" from the Ministry of Objectionable Materials.  The climax of [[Tchaikovsky]]'s ''[[1812 Overture]]'' appears at the end of the track "Knives and Bullets (and Cannons too)". The  Overture is played at key parts at the beginning and end of the film.

Three songs were played during the ending credits which were not included on the ''V for Vendetta'' soundtrack. The first was "[[Street Fighting Man]]" by [[The Rolling Stones]]. The second was a special version of [[Ethan Stoller]]'s "BKAB". In keeping with revolutionary tone of the film, excerpts from "On Black Power" by [[Black nationalism|black nationalist]] leader [[Malcolm X]], and from "Address to the Women of America" by feminist-writer [[Gloria Steinem]] were added to the song. Gloria Steinem can be heard saying: "This is no simple reform... It really is a revolution. Sex and race, because they are easy and visible differences, have been the primary ways of organizing human beings into superior and inferior groups and into the cheap labour on which this system still depends."  The final song was "Out of Sight" by [[Spiritualized]].

Also in the film were segments from two of [[Antonio Carlos Jobim]]'s classic [[bossa nova]] songs, "[[The Girl from Ipanema|The Girl From Ipanema]]" and [[Corcovado (Quiet Nights of Quiet Stars)|"Quiet Nights of Quiet Stars"]]. These songs were played during the "breakfast scenes" with V and Deitrich and were one of the ways used to tie the two characters together.  [[Symphony No. 5 (Beethoven)|Beethoven's ''Symphony No.5'']] also plays an important role in the film, with the first four notes of the song signifying the letter "V" in [[Morse code]].<ref name= "Graphic Novel">{{cite book |last= Moore |first= Alan |coauthors= David Lloyd |title= [[V for Vendetta]] |quote=Inspector Finch recognizes the background noise as Beethoven's Fifth, and states: "It's Morse code for the letter "V"" |publisher= [[DC Comics]] |year= 2005 |month= November |isbn= 1401207928 }}</ref><ref name="BBC News">{{cite web | work=news.bbc.co.uk | title=Newswatch 1940s | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/shared/spl/hi/newswatch/history/noflash/html/1940s.stm | accessdate=21 Nov|accessyear=2006}}</ref> Gordon Deitrich's [[Benny Hill]]-styled comedy sketch of Chancellor Sutler includes the "[[Yakety Sax]]" theme.

==Themes==
The story of ''V for Vendetta'' can be viewed in the tradition of the other cautionary dystopian stories like ''[[It Can't Happen Here]]'', ''[[The Handmaid's Tale]]'' and ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four]]''.<ref name="Znet">{{cite web | work=Znet.com | title=A Political Parable With Swordfights | author=Dave Saldana | url=http://www.zmag.org/content/showarticle.cfm?ItemID=9964 | accessmonthday= 9 May | accessyear=2006}}</ref>  ''V for Vendetta'' sets the Gunpowder Plot as V<U+2019>s historical inspiration, contributing to his choice of timing, language and appearance.<ref name="official production"/>  (For example, the names [[Ambrose Rokewood|Rokewood]], [[Thomas Percy (plotter)|Percy]] and [[Robert Keyes|Keyes]] are used in the film, which are also the names of three of the Gunpowder conspirators).  The film creates parallels to [[Alexandre Dumas, p<U+00E8>re|Alexandre Dumas']] ''[[The Count of Monte Cristo]]'', by drawing direct comparisons between V and [[Edmond Dant<U+00E8>s]].

According to the Official Website, "V<U+2019>s use of the Guy Fawkes mask and persona functions as both practical and symbolic elements of the story.

[[Image:VforVendettaNorsefire.jpg|thumb|300px|left|The Norsefire regime takes totalitarian imagery from many sources: fictional and non-fictional.]]
As a film about the struggle between freedom and the state, ''V for Vendetta'' takes imagery from many classic totalitarian icons both real and fictional, including [[Nazi Germany]] and [[George Orwell]]'s ''Nineteen Eighty-Four''.<ref name="official production"/><ref name="v for vendetta interviews"/>  For example, Adam Sutler (whose name evokes that of [[Adolf Hitler]])<ref name="v for vendetta interviews"/> primarily appears on large video screens and on portraits in people's homes, reminiscent of [[Big Brother (1984)|Big Brother]].<ref name="CNN">{{cite web|last=Owen |first=Gleiberman |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2006/SHOWBIZ/Movies/03/17/ew.mov.vendetta/ |title=EW review: 'V for Vendetta,' O for OK|accessmonthday=19 March |accessyear=2006 }}</ref> In another reference to Orwell's novel, the slogan "Strength through Unity.

This was a symbol used by [[Free French Forces]] during World War II, as it was a traditional symbol of French patriotism that could be used as an answer to the [[Swastika#Nazi Germany|Nazi's Swastika]].  The media is also portrayed as highly subservient to government propaganda, a characteristic of totalitarian regimes in general.

===Modern fears of totalitarianism===
{{quotation|We felt the novel was very prescient to how the political climate is at the moment.

I don't think it<U+2019>s such a big leap to say that things like that can happen when leaders stop listening to the people.|Director James McTeigue<ref name="official production"> </ref>}}

With the intention of modernizing the film, the filmmakers added topical references relevant to a 2006 audience.  According to the [[Los Angeles Times]], "With a wealth of new, real-life parallels to draw from in the areas of government surveillance, torture, [[Fear Mongering|fear-mongering]] and [[media manipulation]], not to mention [[corporate corruption]] and religious hypocrisy, you can't really blame the filmmakers for having a field day referencing current events."  There is also references to an [[Global spread of H5N1|avian flu]] pandemic, as well as pervasive use of [[Biometrics|biometric identification]] and [[ECHELON|signal-intelligence gathering]] and analysis by the regime.<ref name="LaTimes"/>

Many film critics, political commentators and other members of the media have also noted the numerous references in the film to events surrounding the current [[George W. Bush administration|American administration]].  These include the "black bags" worn by the prisoners in Larkhill that have been seen as a reference to the [[Abu Ghraib torture and prisoner abuse|black bags]] worn by prisoners at [[Abu Ghraib prison|Abu Ghraib]] in Iraq and [[Guantanamo Bay detainment camp|Guant<U+00E1>namo Bay]] in Cuba.<ref name="The Age">{{cite web|url=http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2006/03/16/1142098594274.html |title=Gunpowder, treason and plot|work=The Age|publisher=Fairfax Digital |accessmonthday=19 March |accessyear=2006 }}</ref><ref name="CNN"/><ref name="The New Yorker">{{cite web | url=http://www.newyorker.com/critics/cinema/articles/060320crci_cinema | title=BLOWUP: V for Vendetta | author=David Denby | publisher=Conde Nast | work=The New Yorker |accessmonthday=13 March |accessyear=2006 }}</ref> Also London is under a yellow-coded curfew alert, similar to the US Government's color-coded [[Homeland Security Advisory System]].<ref name="Christianity Today">{{cite web | url=http://www.christianitytoday.com/movies/reviews/2006/vforvendetta.html | title=V for Vendetta | author=Breimeier, Russ | work=Christianitytoday.com |date=2006-03-16 |accessmonthday=29 April |accessyear=2006 }}</ref><ref name="Monerey County Herald">{{cite web||first=David| last=Germain|url=http://www.sunherald.com/mld/montereyherald/entertainment/movies/14112078.htm?source=rss&channel=montereyherald_movies| title='V' for Victory| publisher=Monterey County Herald|accessmonthday=10 April |accessyear=2006 }}</ref> One of the forbidden items in Gordon's secret basement is a protest poster with a mixed US<U+2013>UK flag with a [[swastika]] and the title "Coalition of the Willing, To Power."

Bush]].  Finally, the film contains reference's to "America's war" and "the war America started" as well as real footage from the [[Iraq War]].

The modern US imagery is personified in the character Lewis Prothero.

===Comments from political sources===
''V for Vendetta'' deals with issues of [[race]], [[Human sexuality|sexuality]], [[religion]], [[totalitarianism]], and [[terrorism]]. Its controversial story line and themes have, inevitably, made it the target of both criticism and praise from [[sociopolitical]] groups.

Several [[anarchist]] groups have rejected the film, while at the same time have used it as a means to promote anarchism as a political philosophy. On [[April 17]], [[2006]] the [[NYMAA|New York Metro Alliance of Anarchists (NYMAA)]] protested [[DC Comics]] and [[Time Warner]], over what it considers, the watering down of story<U+2019>s original anarchist message in favour of senseless violence and special effects.<ref name="Columbia">{{cite news |last= Launder |first= William |url= http://jscms.jrn.columbia.edu/cns/2006-05-02/launder-anarchistfight |title= "V" stands for very bad anarchist movie|publisher=Columbia News Service |date=2006-05-02 |accessdate=2007-01-05}}</ref><ref name="NYMAA">{{cite news |last= Inducer |first= Smile |url= http://nymaa.org/node/243 |title= V For Vendetta? A For Anarchy!|publisher=NYMAA |date=2006-09-28 |accessdate=2007-01-05}}</ref> [[David Graeber]], an anarchist scholar and professor at [[Yale University]], was not upset by the film. "I thought the message of anarchy got out in spite of Hollywood."  However, Graeber went on to state: "Anarchy is about creating communities and democratic decision making. That<U+2019>s what is absent from Hollywood<U+2019>s interpretation."<ref name="Columbia"/> 
Despite the lack of acceptance by some anarchists, the film has brought renewed interest to Alan Moore's original story, as sales of the original graphic novel rose dramatically in the United States.<ref name="Televisionpoint">{{cite web | work=televisionpoint.com | title=V for Vendetta Graphic Novel is a US Bestseller | url=http://www.televisionpoint.com/news2006/newsfullstory.php?id=1143785410 | accessmonthday=2 April | accessyear=2006}}</ref>  According to [[Publishers Weekly]], by end of the March 2006 ''V for Vendetta'' was the number one graphic novel and number four fiction trade paperback at [[Barnes & Noble]] and was the number one graphic novel and the number three book on the overall bestseller list at [[Amazon.com]].<ref name="Publishers Weekly">{{cite news |last=Reid |first=Calvin |url=http://www.publishersweekly.com/article/CA6321550.html |title=B Is for Big Book Sales |publisher=[[Publishers Weekly]] |date=2006-04-04 |accessdate=2007-01-05}}</ref>

In the United States, several [[Christian right|conservative Christian]] groups were critical of the film's negative portrayal of [[Christianity]] and sympathetic portrayal of [[homosexuality]] and [[Islam]].  [[Ted Baehr]], chairman of the Christian Film and Television Commission, called ''V for Vendetta'' "a vile, pro-terrorist piece of neo-Marxist, left-wing propaganda filled with radical sexual politics and nasty attacks on religion and Christianity".<ref name ="WorldNetDaily">{{cite news |last=Baehr |first=Ted |url=http://www.wnd.com/news/article.asp?ARTICLE_ID=49317 |title=Time Warner promotes terrorism and anti-Christian bigotry in new leftist movie, 'V for Vendetta' |publisher=WorldNetDaily |date=2006-03-17 |accessdate=2007-01-04}}</ref>  Don Feder, a conservative columnist, has called ''V for Vendetta'' "the most explicitly [[Anti-Christian prejudice|anti-Christian]] movie to date"<ref name ="Feder">{{cite news |last=Feder |first=Don |url=http://www.frontpagemag.com/Articles/ReadArticle.asp?ID=21871 |title=The Media's War on the "War on Christians" Conference |publisher=Frontpagemag.com |date=2006-03-31 |accessdate=2007-01-04}}</ref> that "combines all of the [[Hollywood Left|celluloid left<U+2019>s]] paranoid fantasies".<ref name="Feder2">{{cite news |last=Feder |first=Don |url=http://www.frontpagemag.com/Articles/ReadArticle.asp?ID=21715 |title=V for Vapid |publisher=Frontpagemag.com |date=2006-03-20 |accessdate=2007-01-04}}</ref>  Meanwhile, [[LGBT]] commentators have praised the film for its positive depiction of gays, with writer Michael Jensen calling the film "one of the most [[Gay friendly|pro-gay]] ever".<ref name ="afterellen"/>

Dave Saldana from the left-wing media group [[Z Communications|ZNet]] says that the regime's treachery could have <U+201C>come from today's newspaper: secret tribunals, secret prisons, political scapegoats 'disappeared' and tortured, a too-cozy relationship between [[Big Business]] and government, TV blowhards and corrupt religious leaders helping the government do its dirty work, and a ruthless political henchman pulling the strings.<U+201D><ref name="Znet"/>  However, [[David Walsh (film critic)|David Walsh]] from the [[World Socialist Web Site]] criticizes V's actions as "antidemocratic" and cites the film as an example of "the bankruptcy of [[Anarchist terrorism|anarcho-terrorist]] ideology" stating that because the people have not played any part in the revolution (though this view is contradicted late in the film), they will be unable to produce a "new, liberated society."<ref name="socialist criticism">{{cite news |last=Walsh |first=David |url=http://www.wsws.org/articles/2006/mar2006/vend-m27.shtml |title=Confused, not thought through: V for Vendetta |publisher=World Socialist Website |date=2006-03-27 |accessdate=2007-01-04}}</ref>

==Differences between the film and graphic novel==
:''For more information, see [[V for Vendetta]].'' 
[[Image:Vendetta8comiccover.jpg|200px|thumb|right|Alan Moore's original story is darker, with a greater emphasis on anarchist themes.]]
The film's story was adapted from an Alan Moore comic originally published between 1982 and 1985 in the British comic anthology ''[[Warrior (comic)|Warrior]]'', and then reprinted and completed by DC. These comics were later compiled into a graphic novel and published again in the United States under DC's [[Vertigo (comics)|Vertigo]] imprint and in the United Kingdom under [[Titan Books]].

There are several fundamental differences between the film and the original source material.  For example, Alan Moore's original story was created as a response to British [[Thatcherism]] in the early 80's and was set as a conflict between a fascist state and anarchism, whereas the film's story has been changed by the Wachowskis to fit a modern political context.<ref name="mooreinterview"/> Alan Moore charges that in doing so, the story has turned into an American-centric conflict between [[liberalism]] and [[neo-conservatism]], and abandons the original anarchist-fascist themes.  Moore states, "There wasn't a mention of anarchy as far as I could see. The fascism had been completely defanged. I mean, I think that any references to [[Racial policy of Nazi Germany|racial purity]] had been excised, whereas actually, fascists are quite big on racial purity."<ref name="mooreinterview"/>  (Despite playing down racial elements of the regime, the film retains the [[Aryan]] superhero [[Storm Saxon]]).  Furthermore, in the original story, Moore attempted to maintain moral ambiguity, and not to portray the fascists as caricatures, but as realistic, rounded characters.<ref name="mooreinterview"/> The time limitations of a film meant that the story had to omit or streamline some of the characters, details and plotlines from the original story.<ref name="official production"/>

{{spoiler-other|the ''[[V for Vendetta]]'' graphic novel}}
Many of the characters from the graphic novel underwent significant changes for the film.  For example, V is characterized in the film as a romantic freedom fighter who shows concern over the loss of innocent life and even [[Egg in the basket|cooks breakfast]] for Evey. However, in the graphic novel, he is portrayed as a bizarre and almost inhuman anarchist with questionable tendencies.<ref name="IGN"/> Evey Hammond's transformation as V's [[Mentorship|prot<U+00E9>g<U+00E9>]] is also much more drastic in the novel than in the film. At the beginning of the film, she is already a confident woman with a hint of rebellion in her, whereas in the graphic novel she starts off as an insecure, desperate young woman forced into prostitution, who, in the end not only carries out V's plans as she does in the film, but also clearly takes on V's identity.<ref name="IGN"/>  Whereas in the film Inspector Finch is sympathizer to V, in the graphic novel he is determined to stop V and goes as far as taking [[LSD]] in order to enter into a criminal<U+2019>s state of mind.<ref name="IGN"/>  Characters who were completely omitted from the film or had a significantly reduced role include Rose Almond, Alistair Harper, and Mr. and Mrs. Heyer.

The setting and plot of the film were also changed from the original story.  Whereas the film only mentions America's civil war and collapse, in the graphic novel, it is mentioned that a global [[Nuclear warfare|nuclear war]] has destroyed much of the world outside of Britain.  With a [[nuclear winter]] causing famine and massive flooding, there is a real fear that a collapse of the Norsefire government would lead to disaster.  Whereas the film ends in a relatively peaceful overthrow, in the graphic novel there is a violent collapse of authority.  Other differences include the computer system "Fate", which is completely missing from the film. (In the original story, Fate was a Big-Brother-like computer which served as Norsefire's eyes and ears and also helped explain how V could see and hear the things he did.) V's terrorist targets are also different in the graphic novel, as he destroys Parliament and the Old Bailey in the beginning, and destroys [[10 Downing Street]] for the finale.
