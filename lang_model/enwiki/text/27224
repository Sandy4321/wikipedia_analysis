'''''The Whistleblower''''' is a 2010 thriller film directed by [[Larysa Kondracki]] and starring [[Rachel Weisz]]. Kondracki and [[Eilis Kirwan]] wrote the screenplay, which was inspired by the story of [[Kathryn Bolkovac]], a [[Nebraska]] police officer who was recruited as a peacekeeper for [[DynCorp International]] in post-war [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] in 1999. While there, she discovered a [[sex trafficking]] ring serving (and facilitated by) DynCorp employees. Bolkovac was fired and forced out of the country after attempting to shut down the ring. She took the story to [[BBC News]] in England and won a wrongful-dismissal lawsuit against DynCorp.

Kondracki wanted her debut film to concern human trafficking, and she encountered Bolkovac's story in college. She and Kirwan struggled to obtain financial support for the project. Eight years after Kondracki decided to produce the film, she secured funding and cast Weisz in the lead role. ''The Whistleblower''{{mdash}}a co-production between Canada, Germany, and the United States{{mdash}}began filming in [[Romania]] from October 2009 to December 2009.

''The Whistleblower'' premiered on September 13, 2010 at the [[Toronto International Film Festival]], and [[Samuel Goldwyn Films]] distributed the film in theaters in the United States. The film was advertised as a fictionalization of events occurring during the late 1990s. Kondracki said that the facts are broadly accurate but some details were omitted for the film; for example, a three-week "breaking-in" period for trafficking victims was not shown. The film received mixed reviews. The performances by Weisz and her co-stars were praised, but the intense violence depicted in several scenes was debated by critics, with some calling it exploitative. Kondracki and Weisz responded that what happened in Bosnia had been toned down for the film. ''The Whistleblower'' received several awards and nominations, including three nominations at the 2012 [[Genie Awards]].

==Plot==
[[Kathryn Bolkovac]] ([[Rachel Weisz]]) is a police officer from [[Lincoln, Nebraska]], who accepts an offer to work with the [[UN Police|United Nations International Police]] in post-war [[Bosnia-Herzegovina]] for a UK company, Democra Security (a pseudonym for [[DynCorp International]]).<ref name="Lynch"/> After successfully advocating for a Muslim woman who experienced domestic abuse, Kathryn is appointed head of the department of gender affairs.

Raya ([[Roxana Condurache]]), a young [[Ukrainians|Ukrainian]] woman, and her friend Luba (Paula Schramm) are sold to a Bosnian sex-trafficking ring by a relative. Raya escapes with Irka (Rayisa Kondracki), another girl forced into prostitution, and they are sent to a women's shelter for victims of [[human trafficking]]. While investigating their case, Kathryn uncovers a large-scale [[sexual slavery]] ring utilized by international personnel (including Americans). She persuades Raya and Irka to testify against their traffickers in court, guaranteeing their safety; however, an indifferent UN official drops Irka at the border between Bosnia and Serbia when she cannot produce a passport. A corrupt peacekeeper tips off the traffickers, and Raya is recaptured and tortured. Although Kathryn rescues Irka from the woods, the latter is too afraid to proceed with the trial.

When she brings the scandal to the attention of the UN, Kathryn discovers that it has been covered up to protect lucrative [[Defense contractor|defense]] and security contracts. However, she finds allies in her investigation: [[Madeleine Rees]] ([[Vanessa Redgrave]]), head of the Human Rights Commission, and internal-affairs specialist Peter Ward ([[David Strathairn]]). When Raya is found dead, Kathryn sends an email to 50 senior mission personnel detailing her findings; she is then fired from her job. She and Ward acquire evidence of an official admitting the scandal before she is forced to leave the country, and she brings it to the [[BBC News]]. The final credits note that after Kathryn's departure a number of peacekeepers were sent home (although none faced criminal charges because of immunity laws), and the U.S. continues doing business with private contractors such as Democra Security (including billion-dollar contracts in Iraq and Afghanistan).

''The Whistleblower'' is based on the experiences of [[Kathryn Bolkovac]], an American police officer who in 1999 was assigned to serve as a peacekeeper with the United Nations in post-war Bosnia. While there, she reportedly discovered a sex-trafficking ring which served and was facilitated by other peacekeepers. Bolkovac was fired after trying to investigate the ring, but she later won a wrongful-dismissal lawsuit.<ref name="Karpel">{{cite news|last=Karpel|first=Ari|title=Exposing Injustices, the Real-Life Kind|work=[[The New York Times]]|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/31/movies/rachel-weisz-in-the-whistleblower-on-sex-trafficking.html?_r=0|date=July 28, 2011|accessdate=October 3, 2013}}</ref>
[[File:Larysa Kondracki 01.jpg|left|thumb|[[Larysa Kondracki]] decided to make ''The Whistleblower'' after hearing Bolkovac's account of sex trafficking in [[Bosnia-Herzegovina]].]]
Director [[Larysa Kondracki]] and co-screenwriter [[Eilis Kirwan]] learned of Bolkovac's story while attending [[Columbia University]], eight years before the film's production. Kondracki subsequently devoted significant time to research human trafficking and the sex trade. After Bolkovac sold her the film rights for $100,<ref name=Griffin/> she resolved to adapt the story for the screen.<ref name="Karpel"/> Financing for the project was initially difficult to secure, although the situation improved after [[Rachel Weisz]] was cast as Bolkovac. "I was young and na<U+00EF>ve," Kondracki said of her initial attempts to secure funding. "I thought: 'Of course they're going to make my film. It's brilliant!'"<ref name="Karpel"/>

''The Whistleblower'' was described as a "fictionalized dramatic presentation" of a late-1990s scandal. The producers based it on Bolkovac's experiences, rather than on her memoir.<ref name="Lynch"/> [[Vanessa Redgrave]] played [[Madeleine Rees]], a UN human-rights official ("one of the film's few heroic characters") who helps Bolkovac uncover the sex trade. Raya ([[Roxana Condurache]]) and Luba (Paula Schramm), two Ukrainian young women who are trafficked into Bosnia, are the primary representations of the trafficking victims encountered by Bolkovac. Neither is based on a particular person; they are composites of young women forced to work in Bosnian brothels. Kondracki's younger sister, Rayisa, also played a trafficking victim.<ref name="Holden"/> For legal reasons the pseudonym "Democra Security" was used for [[DynCorp International]], the organization whose employees reportedly sexually enslaved the women.<ref name="Lynch"/>

Although the producers kept the film factual, they debated how much to include. Details on the bureaucracy were removed. Kondracki said, "It was too much information and, frankly, people were bored."<ref name="Karpel"/> Another concern was how much violence against the sex-trafficking victims should be depicted in the film. Kondracki chose to bluntly portray the inhumane treatment of the young women, which she described as accurate representations of what happened.<ref name="Lynch">{{cite news|last=Lynch|first=Colum|title=The Whistleblower: The movie the U.N. would prefer you didn't see|work=[[Foreign Policy (magazine)|Foreign Policy]]|url=http://turtlebay.foreignpolicy.com/posts/2011/06/29/the_whistleblower_the_movie_the_un_would_prefer_you_didnt_see|date=June 29, 2011|accessdate=October 3, 2013}}</ref> This included a graphic scene, in which Raya is raped with a lead pipe after her escape and recapture. Weisz thought the reality had been toned down, "In real life there were girls doing this as young as 8 years old."<ref name="Karpel"/> Kondracki agreed, saying that she had lightened the events depicted out of fear that viewers would "tune it out":<ref name="Lynch"/>

Kondracki said that her goal for ''The Whistleblower'' was "information and exposure" on human trafficking. She said, "No one is putting pressure on governments to stop it, and there is no accountability. It's laziness."<ref name="Karpel"/>

[[File:Victor Malarek.jpg|right|150px|thumb|alt=Man in black shirt|[[Victor Malarek]]'s book ''The Natashas'' inspired Kondracki to produce a film on sex trafficking]]
''The Whistleblower'' focuses on sexual slavery, human trafficking and corruption.<ref name=Reed/> Kondracki wanted her first project to concern sex trafficking but was unsure how to create a moving, original plot.

She said, "There are clear and vivid monsters in this film, but there are also those existing in the shades-of-gray middle, nice-enough guys tolerating crimes of unspeakable barbarity."<ref name=Baine/> Justice, another prominent theme, does not materialize by the end.<ref name="Holden"/> The sex trafficking victim Raya is killed, and none of the peacekeepers who participated in the trafficking are prosecuted (although several are sent home). According to Baine, viewers are left with the impression that "the worst violence in Bolkovac's story was the violence done to justice".<ref name=Baine/>

Bolkovac is portrayed as imperfect<U+2014>a "noble but screwed up" individual.<ref name=Reed/> In the film (which roughly mirrors her real life), her personal life is in disarray. She has lost custody of her children to her ex-husband and goes to Bosnia to earn money to move closer to them. While there, she has an affair with a fellow peacekeeper.<ref name=Baine>{{cite news|last=Baine|first=Wallace|title='Whistleblower' focuses on horrors of sex trafficking|work=[[Santa Cruz Sentinel]]|url=http://www.santacruzsentinel.com/ci_18705054|date=August 18, 2011|accessdate=October 8, 2013}}</ref> Kondracki wanted to promote the idea of an average protagonist who acted against injustice while her peers looked the other way.<ref name=Griffin/> Her flaws are offset by her determination to fight the sex trade, and reviewers found these aspects instrumental in making her a three-dimensional character.<ref name=Baine/><ref name=Reed/>

Weisz compared Bolkovac's story of "one lone woman fighting injustice" to that of [[David and Goliath]], her favorite film genre.<ref name="Zakarin"/> In the film, as in real life, Bolkovac begins by investigating a case of a kidnapped girl. As the story unfolds, she discovers a wide-ranging web of corruption and faces growing obstacles.

She said, "I love that kind of thriller, the ordinary person who, because of their character, it's their character that leads them."<ref name="Zakarin"/>

''The Guardian's'' Ed Vulliamy called ''The Whistleblower'' "the most searing drama-documentary of recent years",<ref name="Vulliamy"/> and ''[[The Huffington Post]]'''s Marshall Fine said the story was "dark, grim, and harrowing".<ref>{{cite news|last=Fine|first=Marshall|title=HuffPost Review: The Whistleblower|work=[[The Huffington Post]]|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/marshall-fine/huffpost-review-ithe-whis_b_919214.html|date=August 5, 2011|accessdate=October 8, 2013}}</ref> Doris Toumarkine of ''[[Film Journal International]]'' called the movie a "well-told but troubling story impressively wrapped for audiences who show up in theatres for do-good cinema of a high order".<ref name="Toumarkine"/> Leigh Paatsch of [[News.com.au]] said, "it is Bolkovac's ferocious will to right so many wrongs (expertly channelled by Weisz) that keeps you glued to the screen".<ref>{{cite news|last=Paatsch|first=Leigh|title=Film review: The Whistleblower|publisher=[[News.com.au]]|url=http://www.news.com.au/entertainment/movies/film-review-the-whistleblower/story-e6frfmw0-1226152044553|date=September 29, 2011|accessdate=October 6, 2013}}</ref> Stephenie Foster of ''[[The Huffington Post]]'' gave the film a highly-favorable review: {{quote|It's a compelling and maddening story, and reflects the complexity of how international institutions function and interact and the difficulty of accountability in a situation where people have immunity for their actions.

An equally-positive review appeared in ''The Balkan Chronicle'': {{quote|Kondracki shows great promise with her direction. Pacing is tight for the most part, and the film feels well polished...The film is unsatisfying only in its conclusion. This is not the fault of the filmmakers who choose to stay true to Bolkovac's story. No one was ever brought to justice. A few of men were fired and sent home, but everyone had diplomatic immunity so no one ever faced criminal charges. Two million people worldwide are still being trafficked.<ref>{{cite news|title=The Whistleblower <U+2013> A film about the true story from Bosnia|work=The Balkan Chronicle|url=http://www.balkanchronicle.com/index.php/arts-a-culture/entertainment/movies/1282-the-whistleblower-a-film-about-the-true-story|date=March 20, 2012|accessdate=October 3, 2013}}</ref>}}

Allison Willmore of ''[[The A.V.

The actors' performances received overall praise from reviewers. Camerin Courtney of ''[[Christianity Today]]'' was dismayed that the main character engaged in a sexual relationship with a married man, but Weisz "is wonderful as Bolkovac, a no-nonsense civil servant who is stunned at what she walks into" while "Vanessa Redgrave is a needed touch of strength and warmth as her mentor Madeleine, and David Strathairn is at his government thriller best as Peter Ward, an Internal Affairs agent.

Kondracki's graphic depiction of violence was controversial. Bob Mondello of [[NPR]] called it "sobering", but felt the scenes detracted from the film and should have been more subtle.<ref>{{cite news|last=Mondello|first=Bob|title=A 'Whistleblower' Against International Injustice|publisher=[[NPR]]|url=http://www.npr.org/2011/08/05/138901142/a-whistleblower-against-international-injustice|date=August 4, 2011|accessdate=October 12, 2013}}</ref> Ryan Rojas of ''Tonight at the Movies'' described the film as "gritty and merciless", and cautioned that certain scenes might offend some viewers: "While the scenes do work as reinforcing the horror of the events, it really just made it obvious that the way that the director was going to win over fans was to simply shock them into numbness, as scenes showing rape, mutilation, and murder are shown in very disturbing fashion."<ref>{{cite news|last=Rojas|first=Ryan|title=Movie Review: The Whistleblower <U+2013> A graphically charged drama about real life human trafficking|work=Tonight at the Movies|url=http://tonightatthemovies.com/indexhold/?p=13970|date=August 4, 2011|accessdate=October 12, 2013}}</ref> Christian Hamaker of [[Crosswalk.com]] wrote: {{quote|The film is almost unremittingly grim, which may seem appropriate for such a horrifying subject, but the effect on the viewer is that of being struck repeatedly with a sledgehammer. Sex trafficking is bad. Really bad! Did you get that, or do you need to watch a few more scenes of physical and sexual brutality? Don't worry: ''The Whistleblower'' has those aplenty.

A review in ''The Balkan Chronicle'', an Internet-based newspaper reporting from the Balkans, disagreed with the opinion that the violence was unnecessarily explicit or sensationalized: "Sugarcoating it would do no one any good. Grisly authenticity is one of the film's greatest aspects."<ref>{{cite news|title=The Whistleblower<U+2014>A film about the true story from Bosnia|newspaper=The Balkan Chronicle|url=http://www.balkanchronicle.com/index.php/arts-a-culture/entertainment/movies/1282-the-whistleblower-a-film-about-the-true-story|date=March 20, 2012|accessdate=June 26, 2014}}</ref> Later, when Bolkovac spoke at a screening of the film in Bosnia, it was reported that her message was well-received and discussion about the events that occurred in the late 1990s "did not fail to engage and provoke".<ref name="Sivertsen"/>

==Aftermath==
[[File:UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon - Flickr - The Official CTBTO Photostream (13).jpg|thumb|200px|alt=Bespectacled middle-aged man, speaking into two microphones|In response to controversy caused by the film, UN Secretary-General [[Ban Ki-moon]] promised action to prevent sex trafficking by UN workers.]]
Consistent with Bolkovac's account, ''The Whistleblower'' portrays DynCorp International employees as participants in the postwar Bosnian sex trade with the UN turning a blind eye. UN Secretary-General [[Ban Ki-moon]] hosted a screening of the film and promised action would be taken to prevent further instances of human trafficking. Bolkovac responded, "Unfortunately, the widespread horror is already there. This is not going to be simple or a quick fix." She said that in addition to Bosnia, peacekeepers had violated human rights in Nigeria, Kosovo, Burundi, Sierra Leone, the Congo, Liberia, Cambodia, Iraq, Afghanistan, Haiti, Colombia, Guinea and Sudan.<ref name="Vulliamy"/><ref name="Liao"/> Kondracki added that while she wanted to be optimistic and hoped that the screening would "lead to genuine discussion and thought about the UN's involvement in sex trafficking and other crimes". She worried that it might not have the desired lasting impact, "I know we are going to hear a lot about what has been done since the time depicted in this film, but rhetoric only goes so far. The situation has escalated." Following the theatrical release of ''The Whistleblower'', ''The Guardian'' reported that other UN officials attempted to downplay the events depicted and that initiatives against trafficking in Bosnia were aborted.<ref name="Vulliamy"/>

DynCorp International spokesperson Ashley Burke said: {{quote|I haven't seen the movie so I can't comment on its content, but I can tell you that, when we contacted the film's distributor to learn more about the movie, we were informed that the film 'is a fictionalized dramatic presentation' that while inspired by Ms. Bolkovac's experiences, is not based on her book. There was no threatened legal action taken to ensure they did not use the company's name in the film.<ref name="Lynch"/>}}
