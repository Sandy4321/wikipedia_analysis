The '''Rhinoceros Iguana''' (''Cyclura cornuta'') is a threatened species of [[lizard]] in the family [[Iguanidae]] that is primarily found on the [[Caribbean]] island of [[Hispaniola]], shared by the [[Haiti|Republic of Haiti]] and the [[Dominican Republic]]. They vary in length from 61 to 137 cm (2 to 4<U+00BD> feet) and skin colors range from a steely gray to a dark green and even brown. Their name derives from the bony-plated pseudo-horn or outgrowth which resembles the horn of a [[rhinoceros]] on the iguana's snout.

== Taxonomy ==
The Rhinoceros Iguana is a [[species]] of [[lizard]] belonging to the genus ''[[Cyclura]]''.  The [[genus|generic]] name (''[[Cyclura]]'') is derived from the [[Ancient Greek]] ''cyclos''&nbsp;(<U+03BA><U+03CD><U+03BA><U+03BB><U+03BF><U+03C2>) meaning "circular" and ''our<U+00E1>''&nbsp;(<U+03BF><U+1F50><U+03C1><U+03AC>) meaning "tail", after the thick-ringed tail characteristic of all ''Cyclura''.<ref name="Sanchez">{{cite web | last = Sanchez | first = Alejandro | title = Family Iguanidae: Iguanas and Their Kin | work = Father Sanchez's Web Site of West Indian Natural History Diapsids I: Introduction; Lizards | publisher = Kingsnake.com | url = http://www.kingsnake.com/westindian/metazoa10.html | accessdate = November 26, 2007}}</ref>  The Rhinoceros Iguana's [[species|specific]] name, ''cornuta'', is the feminine form of the [[Latin]] adjective ''cornutus'', meaning "horned" and refers to the horned projections on the snouts of males of the species.  The species was first identified by [[Pierre Joseph Bonnaterre]] in 1789.<ref name="IUCN"/><ref name="Hollingsworth"/>

In addition to the nominate race (''Cyclura cornuta cornuta'') found on [[Hispaniola]], there are two other subspecies of ''Cyclura cornuta'', the [[Mona Ground Iguana]] (''Cyclura cornuta stejnegeri'') and the [[Cyclura cornuta onchiopsis|Navassa Island Iguana]] (''Cyclura cornuta onchiopsis''), although the latter subspecies is believed to be extinct in the wild.<ref name="Hollingsworth"/><ref name="extinct">{{Citation  | last = Blair   | first = David  | title = Navassa Island Iguana  | url = http://www.cyclura.com/status/navassa.htm  | accessdate = 10/07/2007 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071008073651/http://cyclura.com/status/navassa.htm <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 08/10/2007}}</ref>

The Rhinoceros Iguana, like other members of the genus ''Cyclura'', is a large-bodied, heavy-headed lizard with strong legs and a vertically flattened tail<ref name="SS"/>.  A crest of pointed horned scales extends from the nape of their neck to the tip of their tail<ref name="SS"/>. Their color is a uniform gray to brown drab.<ref name="SS"/>  Most adults weigh {{convert|4.56|kg|lb|sp=us}} to {{convert|9|kg|lb|sp=us}}<ref>http://www.seaworld.org/Animal-info/animal-bytes/animalia/eumetazoa/coelomates/deuterostomes/chordata/craniata/reptilia/squamata/rhinoceros-iguana.htm .  Retrieved 10/20/2009.</ref>

These iguanas are characterized by the growth of bony prominent tubercles on their snouts which resemble horns.<ref name="Powell">{{Citation  | last = Powell  | first = Robert  | title = Horned Iguanas of the Caribbean

  }}</ref>  Dr. Thomas Wiewandt, who spent an extended period on [[Mona Island]] studying ''[[Cyclura cornuta stejnegeri]]'', suggested that the horns, along with lateral spines and prominent parietal bulges, function as protective armor against sharp rocks or as defensive tools to facilitate the escape of males from the grasp of one another.<ref name="Powell"/><ref name="Wiewandt">Wiewandt, T.A.  1977.

Males of this species, like other species within the Genus ''Cyclura'', are larger than females, and have more prominent [[Dorsum (biology)|dorsal]] crests and "horns" in addition to large [[femoral pore]]s on their thighs, which are used to release [[pheromones]]. Females have smaller pores and shorter crests than the males, making the animals [[sexual dimorphism|sexually dimorphic]].<ref name="devosjoli">{{Citation  | last =De Vosjoli  | first =Phillipe  | coauthors = David Blair  | title =The Green Iguana Manual

== Distribution and habitat ==
[[Image:Nashornleguan1 fcm.jpg|thumb|right|Rhinoceros Iguana at the [[Frankfurt]] Zoo.]]
Ranging throughout [[Hispaniola]], [[Haiti]] and the [[Dominican Republic]]; Rhinoceros Iguana populations are stable only on Isla Beata and the extreme of the Barahona Peninsula inside Parque Nacional Jaragua.<ref name="IUCN"/><ref name="SS"/>  There are moderately dense populations in the southeastern region of Haiti and its offshore islands including the saltwater lake of [[Etang Saumatre]]. Populations in Haiti are even more endangered due to the deforestation and human clearing practices. In general, the iguanas are found most abundantly in, although not restricted to, scrub woodland, dry forests characterized by [[xeric]], rocky habitats of eroded limestone in coastal terraces and lowlands of the mainland and several offshore islands and small cays in a variety of subtropical life zones and habitat types.<ref name="IUCN"/><ref name="SS"/> [[Image:Cycluracornuta.jpg|thumb|left|Rhinoceros Iguana on Limbe Island, Haiti]]An individual was photographed on May 4, 2008 on the Limbe Island in Northern Haiti.  It had been caught by a group of fishermen from Bas-Limbe, Bord de Mer village.   The Rhinoceros Iguanas caught on Limbe Island are eaten by the local population. This sighting represents a new area previously not thought to be in the range of ''Cyclura cornata''. 

The Rhinoceros Iguana is a diurnal species living primarily in rocky outcroppings with little vegetation for cover.<ref name="IUCN"/><ref name="SS"/>  Although quick to flee when attacked or threatened, they will aggressively attack by biting and repeatedly striking with their thick tail if cornered.<ref name="SS"/>

== Diet ==
[[Image:Rhino.iguana.claw.arp.jpg|thumb|right|Claw of Rhinoceros Iguana at [[Bristol Zoo]].]]
The Rhinoceros Iguana, like most ''Cyclura'' species is primarily [[herbivorous]], consuming leaves, flowers, berries, and fruits from different plant species.<ref name="devosjoli"/>   A study in 2000 by Dr Allison Alberts of the [[San Diego Zoo]] revealed that seeds passing through the digestive tracts of ''Cycluras'' germinate more rapidly than those that do not.<ref name="Derr">{{Citation  | last = Derr  | first = Mark  | title = In Caribbean, Endangered Iguanas Get Their Day  | newspaper = New York Times Science Section  | date =2000-10-10  }}</ref><ref name="alberts"/>  These seeds in the fruits consumed by cycluras have an adaptive advantage by sprouting before the end of very short rainy seasons.<ref name="alberts"/>  The Rhinoceros Iguana is also an important means of distributing these seeds to new areas (particularly when females migrate to nesting sites) and, as the largest native [[herbivores]] of their island's [[ecosystem]], they are essential for maintaining the balance between climate and vegetation.<ref name="alberts">{{citation  | last = Alberts  | first = Allison  | last2 = Lemm  | first2 = Jeffrey  | last3 = Grant  | first3 = Tandora  | last4 = Jackintell  | first4 = Lori  | title = Testing the Utility of Headstarting as a Conservation Strategy for West Indian Iguanas  | work = Iguanas: Biology and Conservation  | publisher = University of California Press  | pages = 210  | year = 2004  | isbn = 9780520238541  }}</ref>  Rhinoceros Iguanas do appear to be opportunistic carnivores as individual animals have been observed eating small [[lizards]], [[snakes]], and insects.<ref name="SS">{{Citation |last= Capula|first= Massimo|coauthors =Behler|title= Simon & Schuster's Guide to Reptiles and Amphibians of the World |year= 1989|publisher= Simon & Schuster |location= New York|isbn= 0671690981}}</ref>

== Mating ==
Male Rhinoceros Iguanas, unlike other members of the genus ''Cyclura'', reach sexual maturity at four to five years of age.<ref name="devosjoli"/>  Females become sexually mature at two to three years of age.<ref name="SS"/>  Male Rhinoceros Iguanas are [[Territory (animal)|territorial]] and the most aggressive males will have the largest range of territory.<ref name="IUCN"/>  Mating takes place at the beginning of, or just prior to, the first rainy season of the year (May to June) and lasts for two to three weeks.<ref name="IUCN"/><ref name="devosjoli"/>  Females lay from 2 to 34 eggs, with an average clutch size of 17, within 40 days.<ref name="devosjoli"/>  Females guard their nests for several days after laying their eggs, and incubation lasts approximately 85 days.<ref name="IUCN"/>  It has been noted that their eggs are among the largest lizard eggs produced in the world.<ref name="devosjoli"/>

== Endangered status ==
  
Although Rhinoceros Iguanas are the most common species of ''Cyclura'' kept in captivity there remain approximately 10-16,000 of these animals in the wild.<ref name ="IUCN">{{IUCN2006|assessors=Ottenwalder, J. |year=1996|id=6042|title=Cyclura cornuta|downloaded=9 September 2007}}</ref>  A successful breeding program existed at the Parque Zool<U+00F3>gico Nacional of the Dominican Republic (ZooDom) from 1974 to 1994, with an average of 100 babies hatching annually.<ref name ="IUCN"/> These efforts included reintroductions of captive-bred "head-started" young to several protected areas in the southwest Dominican Republic in order to reduce the odds of predation by snakes and feral animals such as mongoose or cats.<ref name ="IUCN"/>  The program has not continued since 1995, due to an administrative change at the zoo.<ref name ="IUCN"/>

As of 2009, a reintroduction of rhinoceros iguanas on the Samana peninsula is planned by the [http://www.iguanario.com/Who_are_we.html Iguanario de los Tocones].<ref>Iguanario de los Tocones website, retrieved 2009 January 28, http://www.iguanario.com/Who_are_we.html</ref>

==Captivity==
[[Image:Boston-Rhino-Iguana.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Rhinoceros Iguana at the [[Boston Museum of Science]].]]
The Rhinoceros Iguana is well established in captivity, both in public and private collections.<ref name="devosjoli"/>  Rhinoceros Iguanas in captivity throughout the United States totals 39 males, 32 females, and 36 undetermined individuals at 20 zoological institutions, with an additional 533 animals of unassigned subspecies, reported by seven [[Association of Zoos and Aquariums|American Zoological and Aquarium Association]] institutions.<ref name ="IUCN"/>  The actual number may be much higher considering animals kept at European and Asian zoos and the many kept as pets in private collections.<ref name ="IUCN"/>  As a result, the demand for wild-caught animals to supply zoos and the pet trade has been reduced.<ref name ="IUCN"/><ref name="devosjoli">
