'''Domingo Faustino Sarmiento Albarrac<U+00ED>n''' ([[February 15]], [[1811]] &ndash; [[September 11]], [[1888]]) was an [[Argentina|Argentinian]] activist, intellectual, and writer, and the seventh [[President of Argentina]].  His writing spanned a wide range of genres and topics, from journalism to autobiography, to political philosophy and history.  He was a member of a group of intellectuals, known as the "Generation of 1837", who had a great influence on nineteenth-century Argentina.  Sarmiento himself was particularly concerned with educational issues, and is now sometimes considered "The Teacher" of [[Latin America]].  He was also an important influence on the region's literature.

Sarmiento grew up in a poor but politically active family that paved the way for much of his future accomplishments. Between 1843 and 1850 he was frequently in exile, and wrote in both [[Chile]] and in Argentina. His great literary achievement was ''[[Facundo]]'', a critique of the Dictator [[Juan Manuel de Rosas]], that Sarmiento wrote while in exile in Chile. The book brought him far more than just literary recognition; he expended his efforts and energy on the war against dictatorships, specifically that of Rosas, and contrasted enlightened Europe&mdash;a world where, in his eyes, democracy, social services, and intelligent thought were valued&mdash;with the barbarism of the ''[[gaucho]]'' and especially the ''[[caudillo]]'', the ruthless strongmen of nineteenth-century Latin America.

While president of Argentina from 1868 to 1874, Sarmiento championed intelligent thought<U+2014>including education for children and women<U+2014>and democracy for Latin America. He also took advantage of the opportunity to modernize and develop train systems, a postal system, and a comprehensive education system. He spent many years in ministerial roles on the federal and state levels where he travelled abroad and examined other education systems. From these experiences, Sarmiento developed a great adoration for the [[United States]], a country that in his eyes was a model for Argentina. 

Sarmiento died in [[Asunci<U+00F3>n]], [[Paraguay]], at the age of 77 from a heart attack. He was buried in [[Buenos Aires]]. Today, Latin America respects him still as a political innovator and a great writer.

Sarmiento was born in Carrascal, a poor suburb of [[San Juan, Argentina]] on [[February 15]], [[1811]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Crowley|1972|p=11}}</ref> His father, Jos<U+00E9> Clemente Quiroga Sarmiento y Funes, had served in the military during the wars of independence, returning prisoners of war to San Juan.<ref>{{Harvnb|Bunkley|1969|p=31}}</ref> His mother, Do<U+00F1>a Paula Zoila de Albarrac<U+00ED>n e Irr<U+00E1>zabal, was a very pious woman,<ref name="bunkley24">{{Harvnb|Bunkley|1969|p=24}}</ref> who lost her father at a young age and was left with very little to support herself.<ref name="bunkley24" /> As a result, she took to selling her weaving in order to afford to build a house of her own. On [[September 21]] [[1801]], Jos<U+00E9> and Paula were married. They had 15&nbsp;children, 9 of whom died; Domingo was the only son to survive to adulthood.<ref name="bunkley24"> Sarmiento was greatly influenced by his parents, his mother who was always working hard, and his father who told stories of being a patriot and serving his country, something Sarmiento strongly believed in.<ref>{{Harvnb|Bunkley|1969|p=31}}</ref> In Sarmiento's own words:

<blockquote>"I was born in a family that lived long years in mediocrity bordering on destitution, and which is to this day poor in every sense of the word. My father is a good man whose life has nothing remarkable except [for his] having served in subordinate positions in the War of Independence... My mother is the true figure of Christianity in its purest sense; with her, trust in Providence was always the solution to all difficulties in life."<ref>Mi Defensa, in Obras Completas de Domingo Faustino Sarmiento (henceforth OC), vol. 3 (Buenos Aires: Editorial Luz Del Dia, 1948), pp. 6-7</ref></blockquote>

At the age of four, Sarmiento was taught to read by his father and his uncle, Jos<U+00E9> Eufrasio Quiroga Sarmiento, who later became Bishop of [[Cuyo, Argentina|Cuyo]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Bunkley|1969|p=35}}</ref> Another uncle who influenced him in his youth was Domingo de Oro, a notable figure in the young Argentine Republic who was influential in bringing Don [[Juan Manuel de Rosas]] to power.<ref name="bunkley26">{{Harvnb|Bunkley|1969|p=26}}</ref> Though Sarmiento did not follow de Oro's political leanings, he learned the value of intellectual integrity and honesty.<ref name="bunkley26" /> He developed scholarly and oratorical skills, qualities which de Oro was famous for.<ref name="bunkley26" />

In 1816, at the age of five, Sarmiento began attending the primary school ''La Escuela de la Patria''. He was a good student, and earned the title of First Citizen (''Primer Ciudadno'') of the school.<ref>{{Harvnb|Bunkley|1969|p=36}}</ref> After completing primary school, his mother wanted him to go to [[C<U+00F3>rdoba, Argentina|C<U+00F3>rdoba]] to become a priest. He had spent a year reading the Bible and often spent time as a child helping his uncle with church services,<ref>{{Harvnb|Bunkley|1969|p=37}}</ref> but Sarmiento soon become bored with religion and school, and became involved with a group of aggressive children.<ref>{{Harvnb|Bunkley|1969|p=38}}</ref> Sarmiento's father took him to the Loreto Seminary in 1821, but for reasons unknown, Sarmiento did not enter the seminary, returning instead to San Juan with his father.<ref>{{Harvnb|Bunkley|1969|p=44}}</ref> In 1823, the Minister of State, [[Bernardino Rivadavia]], announced that the six top pupils of each state would be selected to receive higher education in Buenos Aires. Sarmiento was at the top of the list in San Juan, but it was then announced that only ten pupils would receive the scholarship.  The selection was made by lot, and Sarmiento was not one of the scholars whose name was drawn.<ref>{{Harvnb|Bunkley|1969|p=45}}</ref>

== Political background and exiles==
[[Image:Domingo Faustino Sarmiento militar.jpg|thumb|250px|right|[[Daguerreotype]] of Domingo Faustino Sarmiento in 1852 after the battle of Caseros.  Author unknown, the original is hung in the Sarmiento Historical Museum (Argentina). Taken from ''La Fotograf<U+00ED>a en la Historia Argentina'' ("Photography in Argentine History"), vol. I, ''Clar<U+00ED>n'' Newspaper, 2005.]]
In 1826, an assembly elected [[Bernardino Rivadavia]] as president of the United Provinces of [[R<U+00ED>o de la Plata]]. This action roused the ire of the provinces, and [[civil war]] was the result. Support for a strong, centralized Argentine government was based in Buenos Aires, and gave rise to two opposing groups. The wealthy and educated of the [[Unitarian Party]], such as Sarmiento, favored centralized government. While Sarmiento was pro-American and two contemporary U.S. presidents ([[John Quincy Adams]] and [[John Adams]]) belonged to  [[Unitarians|Unitarian]] churches, the two similarly named groups were not the same. In opposition to them were the [[Federales (Argentina)|Federalists]], who were mainly based in rural areas and tended to reject European mores. Numbering figures such as [[Juan Manuel de Rosas]] and [[Juan Facundo Quiroga]] among their ranks, they were in favor of a loose federation with more autonomy for the individual provinces.<ref name="moss171">{{Harvnb|Moss|Valestuk|1999|p=171}}</ref>

Opinion of the Rivadavia government was divided between the two [[ideology|ideologies]]. For Unitarians like Sarmiento, Rivadavia's presidency was a positive experience. He set up a European-staffed university and supported a public education program for rural male children. He also supported theater and opera groups, publishing houses and a museum. These contributions were considered as civilizing influences by the Unitarians, but they upset the Federalist constituency. Common laborers had their salaries subjected to a government cap, and the [[gaucho|''gauchos'']] were arrested by Rivadavia for vagrancy and forced to work on public projects, usually without pay.<ref>{{Harvnb|Moss & Valestuk|1999|p=172}}</ref>

In 1827, the Unitarians were challenged by Federalist forces. Rivadavia lost a war against [[Brazil]] and stepped down from the presidency. With the help of Juan Manuel de Rosas (a wealthy and politically powerful Federalist), [[Manuel Dorrego]] was installed as governor of the Buenos Aires province. He quickly made peace with Brazil but, on returning to Argentina, was overthrown and executed by his own troops. The Unitarian general [[Juan Lavalle]] was elected to take Dorrego's place.<ref name="moss173">{{Harvnb|Moss|Valestuk|1999|p=173}}</ref> However, Lavalle did not spend long as governor either: he was soon overthrown by a militia composed largely of ''gauchos'' and led by Rosas. By the end of 1829 the old legislature that Lavalle had disbanded was back in place and had appointed Rosas as governor of Buenos Aires.<ref name="moss173" />

The first time Sarmiento was forced to leave home was with his uncle, Jos<U+00E9> de Oro, in 1827, because of his military activities.<ref>{{Harvnb|Crowley|1972|p=15}}</ref> Jos<U+00E9> de Oro was a priest who had fought in the [[Battle of Chacabuco]] under [[General San Mart<U+00ED>n]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Bunkley|1969|p=47}}</ref> Together, Sarmiento and de Oro went to [[San Francisco del Monte]], a region politically separate from San Juan. He spent much of his time with his uncle learning and began to teach at a small school in the Andes.<ref>{{Harvnb|Bunkley|1969|p=48}}</ref> Later that year his mother wrote to him asking him to come home. Sarmiento refused, only to receive a response from his father that he was coming to collect him.<ref name="bunkley49">{{Harvnb|Bunkley|1969|p=49}}</ref> His father had persuaded the governor of San Juan to send Sarmiento to Buenos Aires to study at the College of Moral Sciences (''Colegio de Ciencias Morales'').<ref name="bunkley49" /> 

Soon after Sarmiento's return, the province of San Juan broke out into civil war and [[Facundo Quiroga]] invaded Sarmiento's town.<ref>{{Harvnb|Bunkley|1969|p=50}}</ref> As historian William Katra describes this "traumatic experience":
{{bquote|At sixteen years of age, he stood in front of the shop he tended and viewed the entrance into San Juan of Facundo Quiroga and some six hundred mounted ''montonera'' horsemen.  They constituted an unsettling presence [. . . ].  That sight, with its overwhelmingly negative associations, left an indelible impression on his budding consciousness.  For the impressionable youth Quiroga's ascent to protagonist status in the province's affairs was akin to the rape of civilized society by incarnated evil.<ref>{{Harvnb|Katra|1996|p= 29}}</ref>}}
Unable to attend school in Buenos Aires thanks to the disorder, Sarmiento chose to fight against Quiroga.<ref name="bunkley77">{{Harvnb|Bunkley|1969|p=77}}</ref> He joined and fought in the army of General Paz, only to be placed under house arrest when San Juan was eventually taken over by Quiroga.<ref name="bunkley77" />

===First exile in Chile===

Fighting and war soon again resumed, and in 1831 Sarmiento fled to Chile.  He did not return to Argentina for five years.<ref name="crowley10">{{Harvnb|Crowley|1972|p=10}}</ref> At the time, Chile was noted for its good public administration, its constitutional organization, and the rare freedom to criticize the regime. In Sarmiento's view, Chile had "Security of property, the continuation of order, and with both of these, the love of work and the spirit of enterprise that causes the development of wealth and prosperity."<ref>"Los diez a<U+00F1>os precedentes," ''El Nacional'' [[1 May]] [[1841]] [Hmm.  This reference looks a little dodgy!]</ref>

As a form of freedom of expression, Sarmiento began to write political commentary.  In addition to writing, he also began teaching in the Andes.  Due to his innovative style of teaching, he found himself in conflict with the governor of the province. He founded his own school in Pocura as a response to the governor. During this time, Sarmiento fell in love and had an illegitimate daughter named Ana Faustina, who Sarmiento did not acknowledge until she married..<ref name="historiador">Felipe Pigna, [http://www.elhistoriador.com.ar/biografias/s/sarmiento.php "Domingo Faustino Sarmiento"]. El Historiador; Biografias. [this reference needs to be replaced by better ones; see talk page]</ref>

===San Juan and second and third exiles in Chile===

In 1836, Sarmiento returned to San Juan, seriously ill with typhoid fever; his family and friends thought he would die upon his return, but he recovered and established an anti-federalist periodical called ''El Zonda''.<ref name="crowley16">{{Harvnb|Crowley|1972|p=16}}</ref> The government of San Juan did not like Sarmiento's criticisms and censored the magazine by imposing an unaffordable tax upon each purchase. Sarmiento was forced to cease publication of the magazine in 1840.  He also founded a school for girls during this time called the Santa Rosa High School, which was a preparatory school.<ref name="crowley16" /> In addition to the school, he also founded a Literary Society.<ref name="crowley16" /> 

It is around this time that Sarmiento became associated with the so-called "Generation of 1837".  This was a group of activists, who included[[Esteban Echeverr<U+00ED>a]], [[Juan Bautista Alberdi]], and [[Bartolom<U+00E9> Mitre]], who spent much of the 1830s to 1880s first agitating for and then bringing about social change, advocating republicanism, free trade, freedom of speech, and material progress.{{Harvnb|Katra|1996|pp=7-9}}  Though, based in San Juan, Sarmiento was absent from the initial creation of this group, in 1838 he wrote to Alberdi seeking the latter's advice;<ref>{{Harvnb|1993|p=35}}</ref> and in time he would become the group most fervent supporter.<ref>{{Harvnb|1993|p=41}}</ref>

In 1840, after being arrested and accused of conspiracy, Sarmiento was forced into exile in Chile again.<ref name="galvani20">Galvani, p. 20</ref>  It was en route to Chile that, in the baths of Zonda, he wrote the graffiti "On ne tue point les id<U+00E9>es,"<ref name="galvani20" /> an incident that would later serve as the preface to his book ''Facundo''.  Once on the other side of the Andes, in 1841 Samiento started writing for the [[Valpara<U+00ED>so]] newspaper ''El Mercurio'', as well working as a publisher of the ''Cr<U+00F3>nica Contempor<U+00E1>nea de Latino Am<U+00E9>rica'' ("Contemporary Latin American Chronicle").<ref name="crowley9">{{Harvnb|Crowley|1972|p=9}}</ref>  In 1842, Sarmiento was appointed the Director of the first [[Normal School]] in South America; the same year he also founded the newspaper ''El Progreso''.<ref name="crowley9" />  During this time he sent for his family from San Juan to Chile.  In 1843, Sarmiento published ''Mi Defensa'' ("My Defence"), while continuing to teach.<ref name="crowley10" />  And in May 1845, ''El Progreso'' started the serial publication of the first edition of his best-known work, ''Facundo''; in July, ''Facundo'' appeared in book form.<ref>Galvani, p. 22</ref>

Between the years 1845 and 1847, Sarmiento travelled to Uruguay, Brazil, France, Spain, Algeria, Italy, Armenia, Switzerland, England, Canada, Cuba, and the United States on behalf of the Peruvian government in order to examine different education systems and the levels of education and communication. Based on his travels, he wrote the book ''Viajes por Europa, <U+00C1>frica, y Am<U+00E9>rica'' which was published in 1849.<ref name="crowley10" />

In 1848, Sarmiento voluntarily left to Chile once again. During the same year, he met widow Benita Mart<U+00ED>nez Pastoriza, married her, and adopted her son, Domingo Fidel, or Dominguito.<ref name="crowley10" /> Sarmiento continued to exercise the idea of freedom of the press and began two new periodicals entitled ''La Tribuna'' and ''La Cr<U+00F3>nica'' respectively, which strongly attacked Don Juan Manuel de Rosas. During this stay in Chile, Sarmiento's essays became more strongly opposed to Don Juan Manuel de Rosas. The Argentinean government tried to have Sarmiento extradited from Chile to Argentina, but the Chilean government refused to hand him over.<ref name="historiador"/>

In 1850, he published both ''Argir<U+00F3>polis'' and ''Recollections of a Provincial Past''. In 1852, Rosas's regime was finally brought down.  Sarmiento became involved in debates about the country's new constitution.{{Harvnb|Katra|1996|pp=173-176}}

===Return to Argentina===

In 1854, Sarmiento briefly visited Mendoza, just across the border from Chile in Western Argentina, but he was arrested and imprisoned.  Upon his release, he went back to Chile.<ref name="crowley10" />  But in 1855 he put an end to what was now his "self-imposed" exile in Chile<ref>{{Harvnb|Katra|1996|p=189}}</ref>: he arrived in Buenos Aires, soon to become editor-in-chief of the newspaper ''El Nacional''.<ref>{{Harvnb|Galvani|1990|p=23}}</ref>  He was also named to the municipal government, and 1857 he joined the provincial Senate, a position he held until 1861.<ref>{{Harvnb|Katra|1996|p=191}}</ref>

It was in 1861, shortly after Mitre became Argentine president, that Sarmiento left Buenos Aires and returned to San Juan, where he was elected governor, a post he took up in 1862.<ref>{{Harvnb|Galvani|1990|pp= 23-24}}</ref> It was then that he passed the ''Statutory Law of Public Education'', making it mandatory for children to attend primary school. It allowed for a number of institutions to be opened including secondary schools, military schools and an all-girls school.<ref name="penn387">{{Harvnb|Penn|1946|p=387}}</ref> While governor, he developed roads and infrastructure, built public buildings and hospitals, encouraged agriculture and allowed for mineral mining.<ref name="historiador"/> He resumed his post as editor of ''La Zonda''. In 1863, Sarmiento fought against the power of the ''[[caudillo]]'' of La Rioja and found himself in conflict with the Interior Minister of [[Bartolom<U+00E9> Mitre|General Mitre's government]], [[Guillermo Rawson]]. Sarmiento stepped down as government of San Juan, but ran unsuccessfully for president of the Argentinean Republic in 1864 against General Mitre.<ref name="historiador"/> He did, however, become the Plenipotentiary Minister to the United States where he was sent in 1865, soon after the assassination of President [[Abraham Lincoln]]. Moved by the story of Lincoln, Sarmiento ended up writing his book ''Vida de Lincoln''.<ref name="historiador"/> It was on this trip that Sarmiento received an honorary degree from the [[University of Michigan]]. A bust of him still stands in the Modern Languages Building, as well as a statue at [[Brown University]]. While on this trip, he was asked to run for President again. He won, taking office on [[October 12]], [[1868]].<ref name="historiador"/>

== President of Argentina ==
Domingo Faustino Sarmiento was President of the Republic of Argentina from 1868<U+2013>1874. He became president despite the maneuverings of his predecessor [[Bartolom<U+00E9> Mitre]].<ref name="rock130">Rock, 1985, p. 130</ref>  According to biographer Allison Bunkley, his presidency "marks the advent of the middle, or land-owning classes as the pivot power of the nation.  The age of the gaucho had ended, and the age of the merchant and cattleman had begun."<ref>{{Harvnb|Bunkley|1969|p=449}}</ref>  Sarmiento sought to create basic freedoms, and wanted to ensure civil safety and progress for everyone. Sarmiento's tour of the United States had given him many new ideas about politics, democracy, and the structure of society, especially when he was the Argentine ambassador to the country from 1865 to 1868. He found New England, specifically the Boston-&ndash;Cambridge area to be the source of much of his influence, writing in an Argentine newspaper that New England was "the cradle of the modern republic, the school for all of America." He described Boston as "The pioneer city of the modern world, the Zion of the ancient Puritans ... Europe contemplates in New England the power which in the future will supplant her."<ref>Obras, 31: 197, article written Oct. 9, 1865, for el Zonda, Obras, 24: 71. JSTOR [this reference is very confusing; please clarify]</ref>  Not only did Sarmiento evolve political ideas, but also structural ones by transitioning Argentina from a primarily agricultural economy to one focused on cities and industry.<ref>{{Harvnb|Crowley|1972|p=20}}</ref>

Historian David Rock notes that, beyond putting an end to caudillismo, Sarmiento's main achievements in government concerned his promotion of education.  As Rock reports, "between 1868 and 1874 educational subsidies from the central government to the provinces quadrupled."<ref name="rock130" />  He established 800 educational and military institutions, and his improvements to the educational system enabled 100,000&nbsp;children to attend school.  He also pushed forward modernization more generally, installing {{convert|5000|km|mi}} of telegraph line across the country for improved communications, modernizing the post and train systems which he believed to be integral for interregional and national economies, as well as building the Red Line, a train line that would bring goods to Buenos Aires in order to better facilitate trade with England. By the end of his presidency, the Red Line extended {{convert|1331|km|mi}}. In 1869, he conducted Argentina's first national census.<ref name="historiador"/>

Though Sarmiento is well known historically, he was not a popular president.<ref name="crowley21">{{Harvnb|Crowley|1972|p=21}}</ref>  Indeed, Rock judges that "by and large his administration was a disappointment".<ref name="rock130" />  During his presidency, Argentina conducted an unpopular war against Paraguay; at the same time, people were displeased with him for not fighting for the Straits of Magellan from Chile.<ref name="crowley21" />  Though he increased productivity, he increased expenditures, which also negatively affected his popularity.<ref name="crowley22">{{Harvnb|Crowley|1972|p= 22}}</ref>  In addition, the arrival of a large influx of European immigrants was blamed for the outbreak of Yellow Fever in Buenos Aires and the risk of civil war.<ref name="crowley22" />  Moreover, Sarmiento's presidency was further marked by ongoing rivalry between Buenos Aires and the provinces  In the war against Paraguay, Sarmiento's adopted son was killed.<ref name="historiador"/> Sarmiento suffered from immense grief and was thought to never have been the same again. 

On [[August 22]], [[1873]], Sarmiento was the target of an unsuccessful bombing.<ref name="historiador"/> A year later in 1874, he completed his term as President and stepped down, handing his presidency over to [[Nicol<U+00E1>s Avellaneda]], his former Minister of Education.<ref>{{Harvnb|Crowley|1972|p=23}}</ref>

==Final years==
In 1875, following his term as President, Sarmiento became the General Director of Schools for the Province of Buenos Aires.  That same year, he became the Senator for San Juan, a post that he held until 1879, when he became Interior Minister.<ref name="galvani25">{{Harvnb|Galvani|1990|p=25}}</ref> But he soon resigned, following conflict with the Governor of Buenos Aires, [[Carlos Tejedor (politician)|Carlos Tejedor]]. He then assumed the post of Superintendent General of Schools for the National Education Ministry under President Roca and published ''El Monitor de la Educaci<U+00F3>n Com<U+00FA>n'', which is a fundamental reference for Argentinean education.<ref name="efemerides">{{es icon}}http://www.me.gov.ar/efeme/sarmiento/index.html</ref> In 1882, Sarmiento was successful in passing the sanction of Free Education allowing schools to be free, mandatory, and separate from that of religion.<ref name="historiador"/>

In May 1888, Sarmiento left Argentina for Paraguay.<ref name="galvani25" /> He was accompanied by his daughter, Ana, and his companion Aurelia V<U+00E9>lez. He died in [[Asunci<U+00F3>n]] on [[September 11]], [[1888]] from a heart attack, and was buried in Buenos Aires.<ref name="crowley10" />

== Philosophy ==
Sarmiento was well known for his modernization of the country, and for his improvements to the educational system. He firmly believed in democracy and European liberalism, but was most often seen as a romantic. Sarmiento was well versed in Western philosophy including the works of [[Karl Marx]] and [[John Stuart Mill]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Katra|1994|p=78}}</ref> He was particularly fascinated with the liberty given to those living in the United States, which he witnessed as a representative of the Peruvian government. He did, however, see pitfalls to liberty, pointing for example to the aftermath of the [[French Revolution]], which he compared to Argentina's own [[May Revolution]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Katra|1994|p=79}}</ref> He believed that liberty could turn into anarchy and thus civil war, which is what happened in France and in Argentina. Therefore, his use of the term "liberty" was more in reference to a laissez-faire approach to the economy, and religious liberty.<ref>{{Harvnb|Katra|1994|p=79}}</ref> Though a Catholic himself, he began to adopt the ideas of separation of church and state modeled after the US.<ref name="crowley39">{{Harvnb|Crowley|1972|p=39}}</ref> He believed that there should be more religious freedom, and less religious affiliation in schools.<ref>{{Harvnb|Crowley|1972|p=38}}</ref> This was one of many ways in which Sarmiento tried to connect South America to North America.<ref>{{Harvnb|Crowley|1972|p=168}}</ref>

Sarmiento believed that the material and social needs of people had to be satisfied but not at the cost of order and decorum. He put great importance on law and citizen participation. These ideas he most equated to Rome and to the United States, a society which he viewed as exhibiting similar qualities. In order to civilize the Argentine society and make it equal to that of Rome or the United States, Sarmiento believed in eliminating the caudillos, or the larger landholdings and establishing multiple agricultural colonies run by European immigrants.<ref>{{Harvnb|Katra|1994|p=89}}</ref> 

Coming from a family of writers, orators, and clerics, Domingo Sarmiento placed a great value on education and learning. He opened a number of schools including the first school in Latin America for teachers in Santiago in 1842: ''La Escuela Normal Preceptores de Chile''.<ref name="penn387">{{Harvnb|Penn|1946|p=387}}</ref> He proceeded to open 18 more schools and had mostly female teachers from the USA come to Argentina to instruct graduates how to be effective when teaching.<ref name="penn387" /> Sarmiento's belief was that education was the key to happiness and success, and that a nation could not be democratic if it was not educated.<ref name="penn388">{{Harvnb|Penn|1946|p=388}}</ref> "We must educate our rulers," he said. "An ignorant people will always choose Rosas."<ref>qtd. {{Harvnb|Penn|1946|p=388}}</ref>

== Publications ==
===Major works===

* '''''[[Facundo]] - Civilizaci<U+00F3>n y Barbarie - Vida de Juan Facundo Quiroga''''', 1845. Written during a long exile in Chile. Originally published in 1845 in Chile as a serial in a Chilean newspaper, ''Facundo'' is Sarmiento's most famous work.  It was first published in book form in 1851, and the first English translation, by Mary Mann, appeared in 1868.<ref name="ross18">{{Harvnb|Ross|2003|p=18}}</ref>  A recent modern edition in English was translated by Kathleen Ross. ''Facundo'' promotes further civilization and European influence to Argentine culture through the use of anecdotes and references to Don [[Juan Facundo Quiroga]], Argentine caudillo general and dictator. As well as being a call to progress, Sarmiento discusses the nature of Argentine peoples as well as including his thoughts and objections to Don Juan Manuel de Rosas, succeeding dictator of Argentina after Facundo's death. As literary critic Sylvia Molloy observes, Sarmiento claimed that this book helped explain Argentine struggles to European readers, and was cited in European publications.<ref>{{Harvnb|Molloy|1991|p=145}}</ref> Written with extensive assistance from others, Sarmiento adds to his own memory the quotes, accounts, and dossiers from other historians and companions of Facundo Quiroga. ''Facundo'' maintains its relevance in modern day as well, bringing attention to the contrast of lifestyles in Latin America, the conflict and struggle for progress while maintaining tradition, as well as the moral and ethical treatment of the public by government officials and regimes.<ref>{{Harvnb|Ross|2003|p=17}}</ref>

* '''''Recuerdos de Provincia''''' (''Recollections of a Provincial Past''), 1850. In this second autobiography, Sarmiento displays a stronger effort to include familial links and ties to his past, in contrast to ''Mi defensa'', choosing to relate himself to San Juan and his Argentine heritage. Sarmiento discusses growing up in rural Argentina with basic ideologies and simple livings. ''Recuerdos'' discusses his Similar to ''Facundo'', Sarmiento uses previous dossiers filed against himself by enemies to assist in writing ''Recuerdos'' and therefore fabricating an autobiography based on these files and from his own memory. Sarmiento's persuasion in this book is substantial. The accounts, whether all true or false against him, are a source of information to write ''Recuerdos'' as he is then able to object and rectify into what he creates as a 'true account' of autobiography. <ref>Lacayo, Herberto. "Untitled." Hispania 32.2 (1949):pp.409-410</ref>

===Other works===

Sarmiento was a prolific author.  The following is a selection of his other works:

* ''Mi defensa'', 1843. This was Sarmiento's first autobiography in a pamphlet form, which omits any substantial information or recognition of his illegitimate daughter Ana. This would have discredited Sarmiento as a respected father of Argentina, as Sarmiento portrays himself as a sole individual, disregarding or denouncing important ties to other people and groups in his life.<ref name="crowley26" />
* ''Viajes por Europa, Africa, Am<U+00E9>rica'' 1849. A description and observations while travelling as a representative of the Peruvian government to learn more about educational systems around the world.<ref name="crowley26" />
* ''Argir<U+00F3>polis'' 1850. A description of a future utopian city in the River Plate States.<ref name="crowley29">{{Harvnb|Crowley|1972|p=29}}</ref>
* ''Commentarios sobre la constituci<U+00F3>n'' 1852. This is Sarmiento's official account of his ideologies promoting civilization and the "Europeanization" and "Americanization" of Argentina. This account includes dossiers, articles, speeches and information regarding the pending constitution.<ref name="crowley28">{{Harvnb|Crowley|1972|p=28}}</ref>
* ''Informes sobre educaci<U+00F3>n'', 1856. This report was the first official statistic report on education in Latin America includes information on gender and location distribution of pupils, salaries and wages, and comparative achievement. ''Informes sobre educaci<U+00F3>n'' proposes new theories, plans, and methods of education as well as quality controls on schools and learning systems.<ref name="crowley29" />
* ''Las Escuelas, base de la prosperidad y de la republica en los Estados Unidos'' 1864. This work, along with the previous two, were intended to persuade Latin America and Argentines of the benefits of the educational, economic and political systems of the United States, which Sarmiento supported.<ref name="crowley26" />
* ''Confictos y armonias de las razas en America'' 1883, deals with race issues in Latin America in the late 1800's. While situations in the book remain particular to the time period and location, race issues and conflicts of races are still prevalent and enable the book to be relevant in the present day.<ref>{{Harvnb|Crowley|1972|p=24}}</ref>
* ''Vida de Dominguito'', 1886. A memoir of Dominguito, Sarmiento's adopted son who was the only child Sarmiento had always accepted. Many of the notes used to compile ''Vida de Dominguito'' had been written 20 years prior during one of Sarmiento's stays in Washington.<ref>{{Harvnb|Crowley|1972|p=24}}</ref>
* ''Educar al soberano'', a compilation of letters written from 1870 to 1886 on the topic of improved education, promoting and suggesting new reforms such as secondary schools, parks, sporting fields and specialty schools. This compilation was met with far greater success than ''Ortograf<U+00ED>a, Instrucci<U+00F3>n Publica'' and received greater public support.<ref name="crowley29" />
* ''El camino de Lacio'', which impacted Argentina by influencing many Italians to immigrate by relating Argentinas history to that of Latium of the Roman empire.<ref name="crowley28" />
* ''Inmigraci<U+00F3>n y colonizaci<U+00F3>n'', a publication which led to mass immigration of Europeans to mostly urban Argentina, which Sarmiento believed would assist in 'civilizing' the country over the more barbaric gauchos and rural provinces. This had a large impact on Argentine politics, especially as much of the civil tension in the country was divided between the rural provinces and the cities. In addition to increased urban population, these European immigrants had a cultural effect upon Argentina, providing what Sarmiento believed to be more civilized culture similar to North America's.<ref name="crowley26">{{Harvnb|Crowley|1972|p=26}}</ref>
* ''On the Condition of Foreigners'', which helped to assist political changes for immigrants in 1860.<ref name="crowley28" />
* ''Ortograf<U+00ED>a, Instrucci<U+00F3>n Publica'', an example of Sarmiento's passion for improved education. Sarmiento focused on illiteracy of the youth, and suggested simplifying reading and spelling for the public education system, a method which was never implemented.<ref name="crowley28" />
* ''Practica Consitucional'', a three volume work, describing current political methods as well as propositions for new methodologies.<ref name="crowley28" />
* ''Presidential Papers'', a history of his presidency, formed of many personal and external documents.<ref name="crowley28" />
* ''Travels in the United States in 1847'', (Edited and translated into English by Michael Aaron Rockland.)<ref>{{Harvnb|Patton|1976|p=33}}</ref>

==Legacy ==

The impact of Domingo Faustino Sarmiento is most obviously seen in the establishment of [[Latin American]] [[Teacher's Day]] which was done in his honor at the 1943 Interamerican Conference on Education, which was held in [[Panama]]. Today, he is still considered to be Latin America's teacher.<ref>[http://www.me.gov.ar/efeme/sarmiento Domingo Faustino Sarmiento<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> In his time, he opened countless schools, created free public libraries, openned immigration, and worked towards a Union of Plate States.<ref>{{Harvnb|Crowley|1972|p=167}}</ref> 

His impact was not only on the world of education, but also on Argentinan political and social structure. His ideas are now revered as innovative, though at the time they were not widely accepted.<ref name="crowley166">{{Harvnb|Crowley|1972|p=166}}</ref> He was a self-made man and believed in sociological and economic growth for Latin America, something that the Argentinian people could not recognize at the time with the soaring standard of living which came with high prices, high wages, and an increased national debt.<ref name="crowley166" /> 

Today, there is a statue in honor of Sarmiento in [[Boston]] on the [[Commonwealth Avenue, Boston|Commonwealth Avenue Mall]], between Gloucester and Hereford streets, erected in 1973.<ref>Smisthonian Art Institution. "Domingo Faustino Sarmiento Statue." http://siris-artinventories.si.edu/ipac20/ipac.jsp?uri=full=3100001~!14508!0#focus</ref> There is Plaza Sarmiento in Rosario, Argentina.<ref>Rosario City Website. http://www.rosario.com.ar/hoteles/item30.htm</ref> One of Rodin's last sculptures was that of Sarmiento which is now in Buenos Aires.<ref>Musee Rodin Website. http://www.musee-rodin.fr/biotx-e.htm</ref>
