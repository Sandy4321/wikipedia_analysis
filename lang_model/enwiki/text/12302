'''Homer Jay Simpson''' is a [[fictional character]] in the [[List of animated television series|animated television series]] ''[[The Simpsons]]'', voiced by [[Dan Castellaneta]].<ref name="castellaneta">Richmond p. 178</ref> He has become a popular character and an American icon; his signature annoyed grunt "[[D'oh!]]" has been included in the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]''.<ref name=oed>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/1387335.stm It's in the dictionary, d'oh!]. BBC News. [[14 June]] [[2001]]. Retrieved [[2 April]] [[2006]].</ref> Homer is named after the show's creator [[Matt Groening]]'s father.<ref>{{cite news|title=Matt Groening|author=Sadownick, Doug|publisher=Advocate, Issue 571|date=[[1991-02-26]]}}</ref> His voice was originally based on that of [[Walter Matthau]].<ref name="matthau">{{cite news|author=Brownfield, Paul|title=He's Homer, but This Odyssey Is His Own|publisher=Los Angeles Times|date=[[1999-07-06]]}}</ref>

The early seasons of the show focused primarily on Homer's son, [[Bart Simpson|Bart]], but as the series went on and "Bartmania" faded, Homer became more of a focus. Homer embodies several [[working class]] [[United States|American]] stereotypes. He is crude, overweight, intolerant, clumsy, and a borderline alcoholic. He sometimes appears on his couch drinking beer in his [[briefs]]. But in spite of his apparent [[Blue-collar worker|blue-collar]] status, he has had a number of remarkable adventures, and although he is gluttonous, lazy and often simple-minded, he has displayed flashes of brilliance,<ref>The Simpsons Season 7 Episode 13, Two Bad Neighbors</ref> and is a caring and devoted husband and father. Homer has come to be known as a lovable oaf.

==Character Origins==
[[Matt Groening]] first conceived the Simpson family in the lobby of [[James L. Brooks]]'s office. He had been called in to pitch a series of animated shorts, and had intended to present his ''[[Life in Hell]]'' series. When he realized that animating ''Life in Hell'' would require him to rescind publication rights for his life's work, Groening decided to go in another direction.<ref name="americasfirstfamily">{{cite video|people=BBC|year=2000|title='The Simpsons': America's First Family (6 minute edit for the season 1 DVD)|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0250735/|format=DVD|location=UK|publisher=20th Century Fox}}</ref> He hurriedly sketched out his version of a dysfunctional family and named the characters after members of his own family, with Homer named after his father.<ref name="americasfirstfamily"/> Homer then made his debut with the rest of the Simpsons clan on 19 April, 1987 in the [[The Simpsons shorts|Tracey Ullman short]] "Good Night".<ref name="goodnight">Richmond, p. 14</ref>

According to Matt Groening, the whole family was designed so that they would be recognisable in silhouette.<ref>{{cite video | people=Groening, Matt; Al Jean, Mike Reiss|year=2001|title=The Simpsons season 1 DVD commentary for the episode "There's No Disgrace Like Home"| medium=DVD||publisher=20th Century Fox}}</ref> The features of Homer's character design are not used in other characters.<ref>{{cite video | people=Groening, Matt; James L. Brooks, David Silverman|year=2001|title=The Simpsons season 1 DVD commentary for the episode "Simpsons Roasting on an Open Fire"| medium=DVD||publisher=20th Century Fox}}</ref> Homer having the middle name "J.", which was revealed to stand for "Jay",<ref>''[[The Simpsons]]'' "[[D'oh-in in the Wind]]" [[November 15]], [[1998]]</ref> was a "tribute" to [[Bullwinkle J. Moose]] from ''[[Rocky and Bullwinkle]]'' a show Matt Groening loved as a child.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/cult/simpsons/interviews/groening/page9.shtml|title=J is for Jay|accessdate=2007-06-12|publisher=[[BBC]]}}</ref>

==Voice==
Homer is performed by [[Dan Castellaneta]].<ref name="castellaneta"/> Homer's voice sounds different on the shorts compared to most episodes of the half-hour show. His voice was in the beginning a loose impression of [[Walter Matthau]], but developed into a more robust and humorous voice during the second and third season of the half-hour show, allowing Homer to cover a fuller range of emotions.<ref name="matthau"/>

A number of Homer [[neologism]]s have come into everyday use.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.avclub.com/content/node/47756|title=Beyond "D'oh!": Simpsons Quotes For Everyday Use|author=Bahn, Christopher|coauthors=Donna Bowman, Josh Modell, Noel Murray, Nathan Rabin, Tasha Robinson, Kyle Ryan, Scott Tobias|accessdate=2006-07-03|date=[[2006-04-26]]|publisher=The A.V. Club}}</ref> The most famous is Homer's annoyed grunt: "D'oh!" So ubiquitous is the catchphrase that it is now listed in the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'',<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/1387335.stm|title=It's in the dictionary, d'oh!|author=Unnamed author|accessdate=2006-12-24|date=[[2001-06-14]]|publisher=BBC News}}</ref> but without the apostrophe. The first listed usage is not from ''The Simpsons'', but from a 1945 [[BBC Radio|BBC radio]] script in which the word was spelled "dooh." Dan Castellaneta has explained that he borrowed the phrase from [[Jimmy Finlayson|James Finlayson]], an actor in early [[Laurel and Hardy]] comedies, who pronounced it more stretched-out and whiny.<ref name="doh">{{cite news|first=Jeremy|last=Simon|title=Wisdom from The Simpsons' 'D'ohh' boy|format=Interview|publisher=The Daily Northwestern|date=[[1994-02-11]]}}</ref> Castellaneta was told by the show's director to shorten the noise, leading to the famous grunt in the TV series.<ref name="doh"/>

==Biography==
[[Image:Young Homer.png|thumb|left|175px|Homer as a teenager.]]
Although ''The Simpsons'' has a [[floating timeline]] in which the characters [[Ageless|do not age]], and the show is set in the current year, certain dates have been given. He was born on [[May 12]], [[1956]].<ref>''[[The Simpsons]]'' "[[Duffless]]" [[February 18]], [[1993]]</ref> He was raised on a farm with his parents, [[Mona Simpson (The Simpsons)|Mona]] and [[Abraham Simpson]]. In the mid-1960s, while Homer was between nine and twelve years of age, Mona went into hiding following a run-in with the law.<ref name=MotherSimpson> ''[[The Simpsons]]''. "[[Mother Simpson]]". [[19 November]] [[1995]]. </ref>  Homer attended Springfield High School and fell in love with [[Marge Simpson|Marge Bouvier]] in 1974.<ref name=WayWeWas> ''[[The Simpsons]]''. "[[The Way We Was]]". [[31 January]] [[1991]]. </ref><ref name=College> ''[[The Simpsons]]''. "[[Homer Goes to College]]". [[14 October]] [[1993]].</ref> Marge became pregnant with [[Bart Simpson|Bart]] in 1980, while Homer was working at a miniature golf course, turning the crank that spins the windmill (sometimes too quickly). The two were wed in a small wedding chapel across the state line,<ref name=IMarriedMarge> ''[[The Simpsons]]''. "[[I Married Marge]]". [[26 December]], [[1991]]. </ref> spent their wedding reception alone at a truck stop,<ref name=MilhouseDivided> ''[[The Simpsons]]''. "[[A Milhouse Divided]]". [[1 December]], [[1996]]. </ref> and the rest of their wedding night at Marge's parents' house. After failing to get a job at the [[Springfield Nuclear Power Plant]], Homer left [[Marge Simpson|Marge]] to find a job by which he could support his family. He briefly worked at a taco restaurant called the Gulp n' Blow, until Marge found him and convinced him to return. As a result, Homer confronted [[Montgomery Burns|Mr. Burns]] and secured a job at the Plant.<ref name=IMarriedMarge/> Marge became pregnant with [[Lisa Simpson|Lisa]] in 1983, shortly before the new couple bought their first house. In 1985 and 1986, Homer saw brief success as the lead singer and songwriter for the [[barbershop quartet]] the [[Homer's Barbershop Quartet|Be Sharps]], even winning a [[Grammy Award|Grammy]]. During his time with the group, Homer was frequently absent from home, which put stress on his marriage. After the group broke up due to creative differences, Homer went back to Springfield to continue his old life.<ref name=BeSharps> ''[[The Simpsons]]''. "[[Homer's Barbershop Quartet]]". [[30 September]] [[1993]]. </ref> Some time in the late 1980s, Homer and Marge carefully budgeted so Homer could work at his dream job, pin monkey in a [[Bowling|bowling alley]]. Unfortunately for Homer, Marge became pregnant shortly after he started his new job, and not being able to support his family, he went back to the Nuclear Plant.<ref name=MaggieMakesThree> ''[[The Simpsons]]''. "[[And Maggie Makes Three]]." [[22 January]] [[1995]].</ref>

According to comments on ''The Simpsons'' DVD
packs by the writers and producers, Homer's age was initially 34, but as the writers aged, they found that he seemed a bit older too, so they changed his age to 38.<ref name=morecommentary>Mentioned in several DVD commentaries in the [[The Simpsons (season 7)|seventh]] and [[The Simpsons (season 8)|eighth]] seasons.</ref> Some episodes have different ages. In "[[The Homer They Fall]]," he is 38 years old; in "[[The Wizard of Evergreen Terrace]]," he is 39; and in "[[Springfield Up]]," he is 40. Homer's anachronistic aging is obvious; based on his date of birth he should be 51 today. His slow and gradual aging could be seen as a means of maintaining his status as the American [[Everyman]], given the United States' rise in median age. 

In the Series 18 Episode "Revenge Is a Dish Best Served Three Times" it is revealed where Homer was born, when Big Rich Texan says "Turns out we have a lot in common; we're both from Connecticut!"

==Personality==
[[Image:HomerStranglesBart2.jpg|thumb|right||Homer frequently strangles Bart in response to Bart's actions or words; Homer often prefaces the strangling with the exclamation, "Why you little ...!"]]
Homer's personality is one of frequent stupidity, laziness, and explosive anger; one might say it is that of the "[[Average Joe]]." He also suffers from a short attention span which complements his intense but short-lived passion for hobbies, enterprises and various causes. Homer is prone to emotion; he gets very envious of his neighbors, the [[List of characters in The Simpsons#The Flanders family|Flanders family]], and is easily enraged at his son [[Bart Simpson|Bart]] and strangles him in an exaggerated manner. He shows no compunction about this, and does not attempt to hide his actions from people outside the family, even leaving Bart alone at a port.<ref> ''[[The Simpsons]]''. "[[The Great Money Caper]]". [[11 December]], [[2000]].</ref> While Homer has repeatedly upset people and caused all sorts of mayhem in [[Springfield (The Simpsons)|Springfield]], these events are usually caused by either his explosive temper or lack of foresight. Except for expressing annoyance at [[Ned Flanders]], Homer's actions are usually unintentional. Most of his explosive anger is targeted on Bart, because of something stupid or bad he had said or done. Despite their disadvantages, these common outbursts save Homer from dying of a pent-up rage-induced heart attack.<ref>''[[The Simpsons]]''. "[[I Am Furious Yellow]]". [[April 28]], [[2002]].</ref>

While Homer's stupid antics often upset his family, he has also performed acts that reveal him to be a surprisingly loving father and husband: in "[[Lisa the Beauty Queen]]" (episode 9F02, first aired October 15, 1992), selling his cherished ride on the Duff blimp and using the money to enter [[Lisa Simpson|Lisa]] in a beauty pageant so she could feel better about herself; in "[[Rosebud (The Simpsons episode)|Rosebud]]" (episode 1F01, first aired October 21, 1993), giving up his chance at wealth to allow [[Maggie Simpson|Maggie]] to keep a cherished teddy bear; in "[[Radio Bart]]", spearheading an attempt to dig Bart out after he had fallen down a well, even though Homer generally hates doing physical labor; and in "[[A Milhouse Divided]]", arranging a surprise second wedding with [[Marge Simpson|Marge]] to make up for their lousy first ceremony, even going so far as to hire one of [[The Doobie Brothers]] as part of the wedding band and getting a [[divorce]] from Marge, essentially making their second wedding a "real" one. There are many other scenes that show that Homer is a very loving father and husband as well.

Homer tends to derive amusement from the misfortune of others. He is a chronic petty thief and borderline [[kleptomania]]c, stealing from [[Ned Flanders]] everything from TV trays to power tools and air conditioners, even an entire room of the Flanders' house. He has also stolen [[golf]] balls from the local driving range, office supplies (including computers) from work, and beer mugs from [[Moe's Tavern]].<ref>''[[The Simpsons]]''."[[Homer vs. Lisa and the 8th Commandment]]". [[February 7]], [[1991]].</ref>

Homer has a vacuous mind, but he is still able to retain a great amount of knowledge about very specific subjects. He shows small bursts of astonishing insight, memory, creativity and fluency with many languages in nearly every episode. Homer is also extremely confident; no matter how little skill or knowledge he has about anything he tries to do, he has no doubt that he will be successful. However, his brief periods of intelligence are overshadowed by much longer and more consistent periods of ignorance, forgetfulness and stupidity. Homer has a low [[Intelligence quotient|IQ]] due to his hereditary "Simpson Gene,"<ref name=SimpsonGene> ''[[The Simpsons]]''."[[Lisa the Simpson]]". [[8 March]], [[1998]]. </ref> his alcohol problem, exposure to radioactive waste, repetitive cranial trauma,<ref name=Clipshow1> ''[[The Simpsons]]''. "[[So It's Come to This: A Simpsons Clip Show]]". [[1 April]], [[1993]].</ref> and a crayon lodged in the [[frontal lobe]] of his brain.<ref name=HOMR> ''[[The Simpsons]]''. "[[HOMR]]". [[7 January]], [[2001]].</ref> The crayon in his brain is possibly the largest causal factor in his stupidity. Homer's intelligence was said to jump fifty points when he had the crayon removed, bringing him to an IQ of 105, slightly above that of an average person, but he went back to his old self when he had it reinserted, presumably lowering his IQ back to its original 55.

Some episodes suggest that Homer's normal functions do not require the use of his brain, as Homer has at times debated against it. Occasionally, a specific body part such as his face, stomach or liver is also shown debating with his brain. In one notable scene Homer's mind actually leaves his body out of boredom, causing him to collapse.<ref name=LarryBurns>''[[The Simpsons]]''. "[[Burns, Baby Burns]]". [[17 November]] 1996.</ref> Homer is also inclined to retreat into [[fantasy (psychology)|fantasy]], such as daydreaming of [[Germany]] as "the land of chocolate."<ref name=Kraftwerk> ''[[The Simpsons]]''. "[[Burns Verkaufen der Kraftwerk]]". [[5 December]] 1991. </ref>

==Cultural Influence==
In [[2002]], Homer placed second on [[TV Guide]]'s Top 50 Greatest Cartoon Characters,<ref>[http://archives.cnn.com/2002/SHOWBIZ/TV/07/30/cartoon.characters.list/ CNN - TV Guide's 50 Greatest Cartoon Characters]</ref> after [[Bugs Bunny]], as well as 14<sup>th</sup> on its "List of the 50 Greatest TV Characters of All Time". In 2005, Homer Simpson was listed fifth on [[Bravo (television network)|Bravo]]'s 100 Greatest TV Characters.<ref>[http://www.bravotv.com/The_100_Greatest_TV_Characters//index.shtml Bravo > 100 Greatest TV Characters]</ref> He is one of only four cartoon characters on the list, along with [[Eric Cartman]] (#19) and [[The Rocky and Bullwinkle Show|Rocky & Bullwinkle]] (#54). Furthermore, viewers of the UK television channel [[Channel 4]] have voted Homer first place in 2001's 100 Greatest TV Characters. On [[May 30]], [[2003]], Homer was made an honorary citizen of [[Winnipeg]], [[Canada]].  This was to recognize the fact that [[Matt Groening]]'s father &mdash; Homer Groening &mdash; was likely from the [[Manitoba]] capital.<ref>Romaniuk, Ross. "[http://ccr.ptbcanadian.com/simpsons/articles.htm Is Homer Simpson Canadian?]". Winnipeg Sun. [[May 30]], [[2003]]. Retrieved on [[December 10]], [[2006]].</ref>
