"'''Obsesi<U+00F3>n'''" ({{lang-en|Obsession}}) is a 2002 single by [[Dominican Republic|Dominican]]-[[United States|American]] [[Bachata (music)|bachata]] band [[Aventura]]. It was included on the 2002 album ''[[We Broke the Rules (album)|We Broke the Rules]]''. It achieved a huge success in many countries, reaching the top of many international charts.

The lyrics were written by Anthony Santos, and the refrain is performed by the female vocalist Judy Santos (the two are not related). The song explains a man's liking of a woman to the point of obsession. However, this feeling is "not love", and is still only and just an obsession.

In [[2004]], the song was covered by [[3rd Wish]] featuring [[Baby Bash]] produced by [[Mintman]], but this version was less successful than the original version (#7 In Switzerland, #2 in Austria, #12 in France).<ref>"Obsesi<U+00F3>n", by 3rd Wish featuring Baby Bash, in French, Swiss and Austrian [http://lescharts.com/showitem.asp?interpret=3rd+Wish+feat%2E+Baby+Bash&titel=Obsesi%F3n&cat=s Lescharts.com] (Retrieved April 29, 2008)</ref>

Later, in 2005, the song was covered by [[Los Horoscopos de Durango]] in their album ''Y Seguimos con Duranguense''.

Latin R&B artist [[Frankie J]] made an English and more soul-styled version of the song, featuring [[Baby Bash]], which was called "'''Obsession (No Es Amor)'''". This version, although not having success in Latin America and Europe, was successful in the U.S., even reaching number three on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] chart.
