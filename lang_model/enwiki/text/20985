'''Bedrock Gardens''' is a 20 acre garden located on a 35 acre property in [[Lee, New Hampshire]], notable for its [[landscape design]], its [[horticulture]] and its [[sculpture]].

==History==

Named for its ever-present [[stratum|ledge]], <ref>{{cite news |first= Kathleen|last= Hargreaves|authorlink= |coauthors= |title= Taking root|url= |work= New Hampshire Home|pages=38-43 |date= Summer 1995|accessdate=16 March 2009 }}</ref> Bedrock Gardens was bought by its present owners in 1980, complete with its circa 1740 farm house, historic barn and three-holer [[outhouse]]. <ref name=ul>{{cite news| last = Kozubek| first = Jim| title = Original Heavy Metal| work = The Union Leader| date = September 7, 2008| url = http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=UL&p_theme=ul&p_action=search&p_maxdocs=200&s_dispstring=allfields(nooney)%20AND%20date(2008)&p_field_date-0=YMD_date&p_params_date-0=date:B,E&p_text_date-0=2008&p_field_advanced-0=&p_text_advanced-0=(nooney)&xcal_numdocs=20&p_perpage=10&p_sort=YMD_date:D&xcal_useweights=no| accessdate = 2009-03-16}}</ref> Over the next 20 years, it was extensively improved. The wooded areas were lumbered, a trail system was developed, and it was initially managed as a [[tree farm]]. A wildlife pond was built, and work started on its multiple [[perennial]] and shrub beds. [[Hardscape]] in the form of walls, paths, water features and topographical improvements, have been added. <ref name=sweetser>{{cite news | last = Sweetser| first = Robin| title = A Garden That Keeps on Growing| work = Accent Magazine|pages=34-42| date = July & August, 2004 }}</ref> Today it is noted for its concept of "the garden as a journey," with a starting point, "events" (or garden spaces) as places to go, and something to do along the way.

==Interest points==
Bedrock Garden's main attractions fall into three categories: landscape design, horticulture, and art.

===Landscape design===
Bedrock Gardens include "garden beds full of unusual specimens of trees and shrubs: a diamond-patterned, 100-foot fence on which 11 varieties of apple trees have been [[espalier|espaliered]]: a [[formal garden]] with pools, fountains, and water features; a 1-acre wildlife pond with a bridge, and 2 miles of woodland trails." <ref> {{cite news| last = Byrd| first = Janice| title = Salvage Yard| work = The Boston Globe| date = April 8, 2001| url = http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_action=doc&p_theme=bg&p_topdoc=1&p_docnum=1&p_sort=YMD_date:D&p_product=BG&p_docid=0EBB69FFDC76436A&p_text_direct-0=document_id=(%200EBB69FFDC76436A%20)&&s_dlid=DL0109031612261431179&s_ecproduct=DOC&s_ecprodtype=&s_trackval=&s_siteloc=&s_referrer=&s_username=zipity@finegarden.com&s_accountid=AC0109031611284611433&s_upgradeable=no| accessdate =2009-03-16 }}</ref> The smaller gardens include a more formal [[parterre]], the spiritual "Spiral" garden, and the primitive "Dark Woods." <ref name=ul/>

===Horticulture===
Many of the over one thousand different plant species <ref>{{cite news |first= Jack|last= Siebenthaler|authorlink= |coauthors= |title= Plant it in granite|url= |work= Gardens & Landscapes|publisher= Schering-Plough Pharmaceuticals|date= |accessdate=16 March 2009 }}</ref> are in perennial beds, arranged with attention to texture, color, and size. There are other collections, such as the dwarf conifer collection, and the rock garden. The Gardens are said to "have some of the most amazing plants and plantings I've seen in a private garden." <ref name=whimsy/>

===Art===
Scattered throughout the 20 developed acres are small and large pieces of sculpture by several different artists. The larger pieces include two large arches, and a large [[Torii]] in the middle of a double [[all<U+00E9>e]]. One of the artists, Jill Nooney, sometimes noted for her whimsey, <ref name=whimsy>{{cite news |first= Henry|last= Homeyer|url= http://www.gardening-guy.com/|coauthors= |title= A touch of whimsy|url= http://www.gardening-guy.com/stories/storyReader$651|work= Valley News|publisher= |date= July 11, 2007|accessdate=18 March 2009 }}</ref> has been called "the most imaginative and energetic force in modern American garden ornamentation." <ref>{{cite news| last = Stocker| first = Carol|  url=http://bostonglobe.com/news/resources/bio.aspx?id=8278|title = Ignore the Gnome, Forget the Flamingo| work = The Boston Globe| date = August 15, 2008| url = http://www.boston.com/yourlife/home/articles/2005/08/25/ignore_the_gnome_forget_the_flamingo| accessdate = 2009-13-15}}</ref> Many of her sculptures are from old agricultural tools. <ref>{{cite news |first= Trish|last= Umbrell|authorlink= |coauthors= |title= Scrap Artists|url= |work= Horticulture|publisher= F+W Media|date= July/August 2004|accessdate=16 March 2009 }}</ref>
