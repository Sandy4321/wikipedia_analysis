'''Grace Hartman''' ([[1900]]-[[May 23]], [[1998]]), n<U+00E9>e '''Armstrong''' was a social activist and politician in [[Sudbury, Ontario]], [[Canada]], who became the city's first female [[mayor]]. She became mayor on [[October 5]], [[1966]], when she was selected by city council following the death of the city's previous mayor, Max Silverman. However, in the municipal elections the following year, Hartman was defeated when the city's popular longtime mayor [[Joe Fabbro]], Silverman's predecessor, stood for election again. 

Hartman had previously campaigned for mayor in [[1956]], losing to Fabbro.

Hartman was also the second woman president of the [[Ontario Municipal Association]], a board member of the [[Royal Ontario Museum]], and a chair of several social service and community organizations in Sudbury.

She was born in [[Markdale, Ontario]], and moved to Sudbury after marrying George Hartman in [[1938]]. George Hartman died in [[1960]]; Grace subsequently married Arthur Grout in [[1969]]. In [[1975]], Hartman was named one of the 25 leading women of Ontario.

In the late [[1970s]], Hartman and Grout retired to [[Toronto, Ontario|Toronto]], although Hartman returned to Sudbury several times, to accept an honorary doctorate from [[Laurentian University]] and a lifetime achievement award from the city's business and professional women's association. 

Hartman died in Toronto in [[1998]].

In [[2001]], the outdoor [[amphitheatre]] at the city's [[Bell Park (Sudbury)|Bell Park]], the site of the annual [[Northern Lights Festival Bor<U+00E9>al]], was named the Grace Hartman Amphitheatre in her memory. Creating the amphitheatre had been one of Hartman's key projects during her city council term.

She should not be confused with [[Grace Fulcher Hartman]], a former president of the [[Canadian Union of Public Employees]].
