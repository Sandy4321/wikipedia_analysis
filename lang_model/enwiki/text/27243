'''''Moneyball''''' is a 2011 [[biographical film|biographical]] [[sports film|sports]] [[drama film]] directed by [[Bennett Miller]] and distributed by [[Columbia Pictures]]. The film is based on [[Michael Lewis (author)|Michael Lewis]]' 2003 [[Moneyball|book of the same name]], an account of the [[Oakland Athletics]] [[baseball]] team's [[2002 Oakland Athletics season|2002 season]] and their general manager [[Billy Beane]]'s attempts to assemble a competitive team. In the film, Beane ([[Brad Pitt]]) and assistant GM Peter Brand ([[Jonah Hill]]), faced with the franchise's unfavorable financial situation, take a sophisticated [[sabermetric]] approach towards scouting and analyzing players, acquiring [[submarine (baseball)|"submarine" pitcher]] [[Chad Bradford]] ([[Casey Bond]]) and former catcher [[Scott Hatteberg]] ([[Chris Pratt]]), and winning 20 consecutive games, an [[American League]] record.

Columbia Pictures bought the rights to Lewis' book in 2004.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://articles.sfgate.com/2008-10-18/sports/17137214_1_moneyball-brad-pitt-sexiest-man |title=Beane a sex symbol in 'Moneyball' movie? |work=SFGate.com |date=October 18, 2008 |accessdate=October 3, 2011 |first=John |last=Shea}}</ref> After a number of years in development, the film was featured at the [[2011 Toronto International Film Festival]]<ref>{{cite news |title=TIFF 2011: U2, Brad Pitt, George Clooney Films Featured At 2011 Toronto International Film Festival |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/2011/07/26/tiff-brad-pitt-2011-george-clooney-u2_n_909633.html#s316195&title=U2 |accessdate=August 25, 2011 |newspaper=The Huffington Post |date=26 July 2006}}</ref> and was released on September 23, 2011 to critical acclaim.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://popwatch.ew.com/2010/11/24/moneyball-release-date-sony |title='Moneyball' To Get the Ball Rolling Sep. 23 |work=[[Entertainment Weekly]] |date=November 24, 2010 |accessdate=December 10, 2010}}</ref>

==Plot==
[[Oakland Athletics]] general manager [[Billy Beane]] ([[Brad Pitt]]) is upset by his team's loss to the [[New York Yankees]] in the [[2001 American League Division Series|2001 postseason]]. With the impending departure of star players [[Johnny Damon]], [[Jason Giambi]], and [[Jason Isringhausen]] to [[free agency]], Beane attempts to devise a strategy for assembling a competitive team for [[2002 Oakland Athletics season|2002]] but struggles to overcome Oakland's limited player payroll. During a visit to the [[Cleveland Indians]], Beane meets Peter Brand ([[Jonah Hill]]), a young Yale economics graduate with radical ideas about how to assess players' value. Beane tests Brand's theory by asking whether he would have drafted him, Beane having been a Major League player before becoming general manager. Though scouts considered Beane a phenomenal player, his career in the Major Leagues was disappointing. After some prodding, Brand admits that he would not have drafted him until the ninth round and that Beane would probably have gone to college instead. Sensing opportunity, Beane hires Brand as the Athletics' assistant general manager.

The team's scouts are first dismissive of and then hostile towards Brand's non-traditional [[Sabermetrics|sabermetric]] approach to scouting players, most notably Grady Fuson (Ken Medlock) who is fired by Beane after insulting their approach, and takes to the radio airwaves and doubts the team's future. Rather than relying on the scouts' experience and intuition, Brand selects players based almost exclusively on their [[on base percentage]] (OBP). By finding players with a high OBP but characteristics that lead scouts to dismiss them, Brand assembles a team of undervalued players with far more potential than the A's hamstrung finances would otherwise allow. Despite vehement objections from the scouts, Beane supports Brand's theory and hires the players he selected, such as unorthodox submarine pitcher [[Chad Bradford]] ([[Casey Bond]]). Following the free agent signings, Beane finds that he also faces opposition from [[Art Howe]] ([[Philip Seymour Hoffman]]), the Athletics' manager. With tensions already high between them because of a contract dispute, Howe disregards Beane and Brand's strategy and plays the team in a traditional style despite their unsuitability. Beane is eventually forced to trade away the lone traditional star player ([[Carlos Pe<U+00F1>a]]) to force Howe to use the new recruits.

Early in the season, the Athletics fare poorly, leading critics within and outside the team to dismiss the new method as a dismal failure. Beane convinces the owner to stay the course, and eventually the team's record begins to improve. Ultimately, the Athletics win an unprecedented 20 consecutive games, setting the American League record. Their streak is capped with a victory over the [[Kansas City Royals]]. Like many baseball players, Beane is superstitious and avoids attending or sometimes even following games as they are in progress. His family convinces him to go to the A's game against the Royals, as Oakland is already leading 11<U+2013>0 after the third inning and appears set to continue their winning streak. Beane arrives, only to watch the team go to pieces and allow the Royals to even the score. Finally, the A's do clinch the victory with a [[walk-off home run]] by one of Brand's picks, [[Scott Hatteberg]]. Despite all their success, the A's lose in the first round of the postseason, this time to the [[Minnesota Twins]]. Beane is disappointed, but satisfied at having demonstrated the value of his and Brand's methods.

In closing, the film notes that Beane passed up the opportunity to become the general manager of the [[Boston Red Sox]], despite an offer of a $12.5 million salary, which would have made him the highest paid [[General manager (baseball)|general manager]] in baseball history. Also noted is Boston's World Series victory soon after in [[2004 World Series|2004]], based on the theories that Beane pioneered.

==Production==
Stan Chervin developed the first initial drafts of the screenplay after Columbia Pictures bought rights to Lewis's book in 2004. Once Brad Pitt committed to the project in 2007 Chervin dropped out. [[Steve Zaillian]] was signed to write a second screenplay, and [[David Frankel]] was signed to direct.<ref name="Siegel">Siegel, Tatiana (2008-10-16).

<blockquote>I think we have a way in, making it visual and making it funny. I want it to be really funny and entertaining, and I want you to not realize how much information is being thrown at you because you're having fun. We've found a couple of ideas on how to bust the form a bit, in order for all that information to reach you in a way that's a little oblique.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://suicidegirls.com/interviews/Steven%20Soderbergh%3A%20The%20Girlfriend%20Experience/ |title = Steven Soderbergh: The Girlfriend Experience |publisher = [[SuicideGirls.com]] |date = 21 May 2009 |accessdate = 2009-05-21 }}</ref></blockquote>
