Sri Aurobindo studied for the [[Imperial Civil Service|Indian civil service]] at [[King's College, Cambridge]], [[England]]. After returning to India he took up various civil service works under the [[Maharaja]] of [[Baroda]] and started to involve himself in politics. He was imprisoned by [[British Raj|British governance in India]].  for writing articles against British rule. He was released when no evidence was provided. During his stay in the jail he had mystical and spiritual experiences, after which he moved to [[Pondicherry (city)|Pondicherry]], leaving politics for [[Spirituality|spiritual]] work.<ref name="ReferenceA">Sri Aurobindo: a biography and a history, K.

During his stay in Pondicherry, Sri Aurobindo evolved a new method of spiritual practice, which he called [[Integral Yoga]]. The central theme of his vision was the evolution of human life into a life [[divine]]. He believed in a spiritual realisation that not only liberated man but also transformed his nature, enabling a divine life on earth. In 1926, with the help of his spiritual collaborator, [[Mirra Alfassa]] ("The Mother"), he founded the [[Sri Aurobindo Ashram]]. He died on 5 December 1950 in Pondicherry.<ref name="ReferenceA"/> He was the first Indian to create a major literary corpus in English.<ref name="books.google.com">Arvind Krishna Mehrotra, ''A history of Indian literature in English'' 116 [http://books.google.com/books?id=OFvyBHXH-ssC&lpg=PP1&dq=History%20of%20Indian%20literature%20in%20English&pg=PA116#v=onepage&q=aurobindo&f=false]</ref>

His main literary works are ''[[Life Divine|The Life Divine]]'', which deals with theoretical aspects of Integral Yoga; ''[[Synthesis of Yoga]]'', which deals with practical guidance to Integral Yoga; and ''Savitri'', an [[epic poem]] which refers to a passage in the ''[[Mahabharata]]'', where its characters actualise integral yoga in their lives.

=== Early life ===
[[File:Aurobindo.family.jpg|thumb|200px|upright|Sri Aurobindo with his father Dr. K.D. Ghose, his mother Swarnalata Devi and four siblings: From left to right:  [[Barin Ghosh]], Sarojini, Sri Aurobindo and [[Manmohan Ghose]].]]
Sri Aurobindo Ghosh was born in a [[Bengali Hindu]] family in [[Calcutta]] (now [[Kolkata]]), [[West Bengal]], India on 15 August 1872. His father, Krishna Dhan Ghosh, was District Surgeon of [[Rangpur District|Rangapur]], [[Bengal]]. His mother, Swarnalata Devi. Sri Aurobindo had two elder siblings <U+2013> [[Manmohan Ghose]], and [[Barindra Kumar Ghosh|Benoy Bhushan Ghose]] (also referred to as [[Barin Ghosh]]) and a sister named Sarojini Ghose.<ref>http://www.aurobindo.ru/persons/00176_e.htm</ref>  In 1877 Sri Aurobindo along with two elder siblings were sent to the [[Loreto Convent, Darjeeling|Loreto Convent]] school in [[Darjeeling]] & his father was posted at various positions at the Government hospitals in Bengal during this time. His father was believed to be an [[atheism|atheist]] according to Sri Aurobindo and wanted his sons to study for [[Indian civil service]] in England.<ref name="ReferenceA"/><ref name="books.google.de"/>

=== England (1879<U+2013>1893) ===
[[File:Sri Aurobindo's Home St Stephen's Avenue London 1884-1887.JPG|thumb|200px|upright|Sri Aurobindo's home in St Stephen's Avenue, London 1884<U+2013>1887, with [[English Heritage]] blue plaque]]

In 1879, his father took Sri Aurobindo and his two elder brothers to [[Manchester]], England for a European education. The brothers were placed in the care of the Reverend W.H. Drewett and his wife, in London. Drewett was an [[Anglican]] priest whom Krishna Dhan Ghose knew through his British friends at Rangapur. The Drewetts tutored the Sri Aurobindo Ghose and his brothers privately; they were asked to keep the tuition completely secular and to make no mention of India or its culture.<ref name="ReferenceA"/><ref name="books.google.de"/>

Between 1880 and 1884, while his brothers where studying at [[Manchester Grammar School]], Sri Aurobindo studied at home where Mr Drewett coached Sri Aurobindo in Latin and his wife coached him in French, geography and arithmetic until he joined [[St Paul's School (London)|St Paul's School,]] London. Here he learnt Greek, spending the last three years reading literature and English poetry.<ref>{{Harvnb|Aurobindo|2006|p=27}}</ref> He also acquired some familiarity with German and Italian languages.<ref>{{Harvnb|Aurobindo|2006|p=28}}</ref> His father wanted his sons to pass the prestigious [[Indian Civil Service]] examination, but in 1889 it appeared that of the three brothers, only young Sri Aurobindo had a chance of fulfilling his father's aspirations, his brothers having already decided their future careers. To become an ICS official, students were required to pass the competitive examination, as well as to study at an English university for two years under probation. Sri Aurobindo secured a scholarship at [[King's College, Cambridge]], under recommendation of [[Oscar Browning]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Aurobindo|2006|pp=29<U+2013>30}}</ref> He also passed the written examination of the Indian Civil Service after a few months, where he was ranked 11th out of 250 competitors. He spent the next two years at King's College.<ref>{{acad|id=GHS890AA|name=Ghose, Aravinda Acroyd}}</ref>

A [[blue plaque]] unveiled in 2007 commemorates Sri Aurobindo's residence at 49 St Stephen's Avenue in [[Shepherd's Bush]], London, from 1884 to 1887.<ref name='EngHet'>{{cite web|url=http://www.english-heritage.org.uk/discover/blue-plaques/search/aurobindo-sri-1872-1950|title=AUROBINDO, SRI (1872<U+2013>1950)|publisher=English Heritage|accessdate=18 August 2012}}</ref>

Sri Aurobindo had no interest in ICS exam and came late to the horse riding exam purposefully to get himself disqualified for the service.<ref>{{Harvnb|Aurobindo|2006|p=31}}</ref>

At this time, the [[Maharaja]] of [[Baroda]], [[Sayajirao Gaekwad III]], was travelling in England. James Cotton, brother of Sir Henry Cotton, was then Lieutenant Governor of Bengal and Secretary of the South Kensington Liberal Club, knew Aurobindo and his father, secured for him a place in Baroda State Service and arranged for him to meet the prince. He left England for India, arriving there in February 1893.<ref>{{Harvnb|Aurobindo|2006|p=34}}</ref> In India Sri Aurobindo's father who was waiting to receive his son was misinformed by his agents from [[Bombay]] (now Mumbai) that the ship on which Aurobindo had been travelling had sunk off the coast of Portugal.

=== Baroda & Calcutta (1893<U+2013>1910) ===
{{main|Aurobindo's politics}}
In Baroda, Sri Aurobindo joined the state service in 1893, working first in the Survey and Settlements department, later moving to the Department of Revenue and then to the Secretariat, and many miscellaneous work like teaching grammar and assisted in writing speeches for the maharaja of [[Gaekwad]] till 1897.<ref>{{Harvnb|Aurobindo|2006|p=37}}</ref> In 1897 during his work in Baroda he started working as a part-time French teacher at [[Baroda college]] (now [[Maharaja Sayajirao University of Baroda]]), he was later promoted to the post of Vice-Principal.<ref>{{Harvnb|Aurobindo|2006|p=42}}</ref> At Baroda, Sri Aurobindo self studied [[Sanskrit]] and Bengali.<ref>{{Harvnb|Aurobindo|2006|p=43}}</ref>

During his stay at Baroda he contributed to many articles to Indu Prakash and spoke as a chairman of the Baroda college board.<ref>{{Harvnb|Aurobindo|2006|p=68}}</ref> He published the first of his collections of English poetry, ''The Rishi'' from Baroda.<ref>http://intyoga.online.fr/rishi.htm</ref> He also started taking active interest in the politics of India's freedom struggle against British rule, working behind the scenes as his position at the [[Baroda State]] barred him from overt political activity. He linked up with resistance groups in [[Bengal]] and [[Madhya Pradesh]], while travelling to these states. He established contact with [[Lokmanya Tilak]] and [[Sister Nivedita]]. He also arranged for the military training of Jatindra Nath Banerjee ([[Niralamba Swami]]) in the Baroda army and then dispatched him to organise the resistance groups in Bengal.<ref>{{Harvnb|Aurobindo|2006|p=77}}</ref>

Sri Aurobindo was often travelling between Baroda and Bengal, at first in a bid to re-establish links with his parent's families and his other Bengali relatives, including his cousin Sarojini and brother Barin, and later increasingly in a bid to establish resistance groups across Bengal. But he formally moved to [[Calcutta]] (now Kolkata) only in 1906 after the announcement of [[Partition of Bengal (1905)|Partition of Bengal]]. During his visit to Calcutta in 1901 he married Mrinalini, daughter of Bhupal Chandra Bose, a senior official in Government service. Aurobindo Ghose was then 28; the bride Mrinalini, 14. She passed away due to [[Influenza]] in December 1918.<ref>{{Harvnb|Heehs|2008|p=53}}</ref>

[[File:Sri Aurobindo presiding over a meeting of the Nationalists after the Surat Congress, with Tilak speaking, 1907.jpg|thumb|200px|Sri Aurobindo presiding over a meeting of the Nationalists after the Surat Congress, 1907]]
Aurobindo was influenced by studies on rebellion and revolutions against England in medieval France and the revolts in America and Italy. In his public activity he took up non-co-operation and passive resistance in front but also took up secret revolutionary activity as a preparation for open revolt, in case that the passive revolt failed.<ref>{{Harvnb|Aurobindo|2006|p=71}}</ref>

In Bengal with Barin's help he established contacts with revolutionaries, inspiring radicals like [[Bagha Jatin]], Jatin Banerjee, Surendranath Tagore.He helped establish a series of youth clubs like the [[Anushilan Samiti]] of Calcutta in 1902.<ref>{{Harvnb|Heehs|2008|p=67}}</ref>

Sri Aurobindo attended Congress meeting in 1906  headed by [[Dadabhai Naoroji]] and participated as a councillor in forming the fourfold objectives of "Swaraj, Swadesh, Boycott and national education". In 1907 at Surat session of Congress where moderates and extremists had a major showdown, he led with extremists along with [[Bal Gangadhar Tilak]]. The Congress split after this session.<ref>[http://www.hindu.com/mag/2007/12/30/stories/2007123050120400.htm "The great ideological split"] The Hindu</ref> In 1907<U+2013>1908 Aurobindo travelled extensively to [[Pune]], [[Bombay]] and [[Baroda]] to firm up support for the nationalist cause, giving speeches and meeting various groups. He was arrested again in May 1908 in connection with the Alipore Bomb Case. He was acquitted in the ensuing trial and released after a year of isolated incarceration. Once out of the prison he started two new publications, Karmayogin in English and Dharma in Bengali. He also delivered the [[s:Uttarpara Speech|Uttarpara Speech]] hinting at the transformation of his focus to spiritual matters. The British persecution continued because of his writings in his new journals and in April 1910 Aurobindo, according to Aurobindo obeying an inner command which he had formed the habit of unquestioningly heeding, moved to [[Pondicherry (city)|Pondicherry]], where Britain's [[secret police]] monitored his activities.<ref name = "Lorenzo 1999, 70">Lorenzo, David J.

=== Conversion from politics to spirituality ===
{{Sri Aurobindo}}
In July 1905 then [[Viceroy of India]], [[Lord Curzon]] [[Partition of Bengal (1905)|Partitioned Bengal]], it sparked an outburst of public anger against the British, the anger led to civil unrest and a nationalist campaign was carried out by groups of revolutionaries which included Aurobindo, in 1908 [[Khudiram Bose]] and [[Prafulla Chaki]] attempted to kill Magistrate Kingsford, a judge known for handing down particularly sentences against nationalists. However, the bomb thrown at his horse carriage missed its target and instead landed in another carriage and killed two British women, the wife and daughter of barrister [[Pringle Kennedy]]. Aurobindo was also arrested on charges of planning and overseeing the attack and imprisoned in solitary confinement in [[Alipore Jail]]. The trial ("[[Alipore Bomb Case]], 1908") lasted for one full year, but eventually Sri Aurobindo was acquitted. His Defence Counsel was [[Chittaranjan Das]]. On acquittal, Sri Aurobindo was invited to deliver a speech at Uttarpara where he first spoke of some of his experiences in jail. Afterwards in 1909  Sri Aurobindo started two new weekly papers: the ''Karmayogin'' in English and the ''Dharma'' in Bengali.<ref>{{Harvnb|Aurobindo|2006|p=86}}</ref>

Sri Aurobindo said he was visited by Swami''' '''[[swami Vivekananda|Vivekananda]] in the Alipore Jail. In his words, "It is a fact that I was hearing constantly the voice of Vivekananda speaking to me for a fortnight in the jail in my solitary meditation and felt his presence.<ref>{{Harvnb|Aurobindo|2006|p=98}}</ref> The voice spoke only on a special and limited but very important field of spiritual experience and it ceased as soon as it had finished saying all that it had to say on that subject."

In his Autobiographical notes Aurobindo claims to have had experinces of a vast sense of calmness when he first came back to India which he found no explanation for and continued to have various such experiences from time to time but had not known about any [[yoga]] or what yoga was and contended these as mere experiences and not any part of his yoga.<ref name="Aurobindo 2006 110">{{Harvnb|Aurobindo|2006|p=110}}</ref> Aurobindo is said to have started his practise without teacher except for some rules which he got through one of his friend  Ganganath who was a disciple of [[Swami Brahmananda]],<ref name="Aurobindo 2006 110"/> when Aurobindo became involved with Congress and ''Vande Mataram'', Barin had continued to meet patriotic youngsters for recruitment for such a plan. In 1907, Barin introduced Aurobindo to Vishnu Bhaskar Lele, a [[Maharashtra|Maharashtrian]] [[yogi]]. Aurobindo was influenced by the guidance he got from him, he had instructed Aurobindo to depend on an inner guide and any kind of external guru or guidance would not be required, It is also said that he had met [[Sadhu|Naga sanyasi]] and was impressed by their healing powers.<ref>{{Harvnb|Aurobindo|2006|p=109}}</ref>

In 1910 Sri Aurobindo withdrew himself from all political activities and secretly stayed at [[Chandannagar]], where he was being searched for one of the articles which was under his name in karmayogin. Later when the warrant against him was dropped he moved to [[Puducherry|Pondicherry]], then a [[French colony]].<ref name="Aurobindo 2006 101"/>

===Pondicherry (1910<U+2013>1950)===
[[File:<U+0BAA><U+0BC1><U+0BA4><U+0BC1><U+0B9A><U+0BCD><U+0B9A><U+0BC7><U+0BB0><U+0BBF>.jpg|thumbnail|[[Sri Aurobindo Ashram]] in [[pondicherry]] ]]
In [[Pondicherry (city)|Pondicherry]], Sri Aurobindo completely dedicated himself to his spiritual and philosophical pursuits. In 1914, after four years of secluded yoga, Sri Aurobindo started a philosophical magazine published monthly called ''[[Arya (journal)|Arya]]''. Arya stopped its publication in 1921. Many years later, Aurobindo revised some of these works before they were published in book form.<ref name="Sketch">{{Citation  | last = Sketch | first = life  | title = sri Aurobindo A life sketch  | url=http://www.sriaurobindoashram.org/ashram/sriauro/life_sketch.php  | accessdate = 1 January 2013 }}</ref> some of the book series derieved out of this publications were ''[[The Life Divine]]'', ''[[The Synthesis of Yoga]]'', ''Essays on The Gita'', ''The Secret of The Veda'', ''Hymns to the Mystic Fire'', ''The Upanishads'', ''The Renaissance in India'', ''War and Self-determination'', ''The Human Cycle'', ''The Ideal of Human Unity'' and ''The Future Poetry'' were published in this magazine. 

At the beginning of his stay at Pondicherry, there were few followers, but with time their numbers grew, resulting in the formation of the [[Sri Aurobindo Ashram]] in 1926.<ref name=Sketch/> In 1926 he first signed his name as "Sri Aurobindo." Surname seems to have first appeared in print in articles published in [[Chandannagar]], in 1920. [[Sri]] a [[Sanskrit]] word usually used interms of [[honorific]] translation as [[holy]]. It did not catch on at that time. He first signed his name Sri Aurobindo in March 1926, but continued to use Sri Aurobindo Ghose for a year or two.<ref name="Heehs 2011">{{Harvnb|Heehs|2011|p=347}}</ref>

For some time afterwards, Sri Aurobindo's main literary output was his voluminous correspondence with his disciples. His letters, most of which were written in the 1930s, numbered in the several thousands. Many were brief comments made in the margins of his disciple's notebooks in answer to their questions and reports of their spiritual practice<U+2014>others extended to several pages of carefully composed explanations of practical aspects of his teachings. These were later collected and published in book form in three volumes of ''[[Letters on Yoga]].'' In the late 1930s, Sri Aurobindo resumed work on a poem he had started earlier<U+2014>he continued to expand and revise this poem for the rest of his life. It became perhaps his greatest literary achievement, ''[[Savitri (book)|Savitri]]'', an epic spiritual poem in blank verse of approximately 24,000 lines.<ref>{{Harvnb|Aurobindo|2006|p=584}}</ref>

Sri Aurobindo died of physical ailments on 5 December 1950, around 60,000 people have said to have attended his funneral, then Prime minister of India [[Jawaharlal Nehru|Jawarharlal Nehru]] & President of India [[Rajendra Prasad]] said to have praised him for his extrodinary contribution to Yogic philosophy and freedom strugle, and both national and Interanational newspapers commemorated his death<ref name="Heehs 2011">{{Harvnb|Heehs|2011|p=411}}</ref> <ref name=Sketch/>

[[File:Mirra Alfassa 1919-1.jpg|[[Mirra Richard]], known as ''the Mother''|150px|right|thumb]]

=== Mirra Richard & the development of the [[Sri Aurobindo Ashram|Ashram]] ===
Sri Aurobindo's close spiritual collaborator, [[Mirra Richard]] (b. Alfassa), came to be known as ''The Mother'' simply because Sri Aurobindo started to call her by this name.<ref>{{Citation  | last = the | first = mother  | title = The Mother  | url=http://www.auroville.org/vision/ma.htm  | accessdate = 1 January 2013 }}</ref>

Mirra a [[French people|french national]] was born in [[Paris]], [[France]] on 21 February 1878. In her 20s she studied [[occultism]] with [[Max Theon]]. She along with her husband Paul Richard went to [[Pondicherry]] on 29 March 1914<ref>{{Harvnb|Aurobindo|2006|p=102}}</ref>, finally settling there in 1920. Aurobindo considered her his spiritual equal and collaborator. After 24 November 1926, when Aurobindo retired into seclusion, he left it to her to plan, run and build the Sri Aurobindo Ashram, the community of disciples which had gathered around them. Some time later when families with children joined the ashram, she established and supervised the [[Sri Aurobindo International Centre of Education]] with its experiments in the field of education. When Aurobindo died in 1950, she continued their spiritual work, directed the ashram and guided their disciples.<ref>{{Citation  | last = the | first = mother  | title = The Mother  | url=http://www.auroville.org/vision/ma.htm  | accessdate = 1 January 2013 }}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Aurobindo|2006|p=103}}</ref>

Written at the third person }}
=== Background ===
Sri Aurobindo wrote that his philosophy "was formed first by the study of the Upanishads and the Gita", as well as "knowledge that flowed from above when I sat in meditation".<ref name="Heehs 2011">{{Harvnb|Heehs|2011}}</ref> [[Peter Heehs]] an American historian writes that examination of Aurobindo's manuscripts bears out Aurobindo's statement. (Historian) Heehs writes that the influence of the Indian [[Vedanta|Vedantic]] tradition on Aurobindo's thought was enormous. The other major component was ideas that Aurobindo encountered during his education, such as the theory of evolution.<ref name="Heehs 2011"/>

=== Yogic philosophy ===
Sri Aurobindo calls his yoga as [[integral yoga]], and according to Sri Aurobindo most ways of other [[yoga]] are paths to beyond of human existence and towards reaching [[Soul|spirit]] as a final objective and away from normal life. Sri Aurobindo's philosophy aims at ascending to the spirit and again descending to normal existence to transform it.

According to Sri Aurobindo [[mind]] is the highest term reached in the path of evolution till now but has not yet reached its highest potency and calls current mind as an ignorance seeking truth, but he also states that even though the human being is treading in ignorance there is in every human being a possibility of divine manifestation. Sri Aurobindo states that there is a possibility to open oneself to higher divine consciousness which would reveal one's true self, remain in constant union of divine and bring down a higher force (which he names as superamental force) which would transform mind, life and body. To realise the above has been the main objectives of Sri Aurobindo's yoga.<ref name="Aurobindo 2006 10">{{Harvnb|Aurobindo|2006|p=10}}</ref>

==== Triple transformation of the individual ====
Sri Aurobindo argues that Man is born an ignorant, divided, conflicted being; a product of the original inconscience (i.e. unconsciousness) inherent in Matter that he evolved out of. As a result, he does not know the nature of Reality, including its source and purpose; his own nature, including the parts and integration of his being; what purpose he serves, and what his individual and spiritual potential is, amongst others. In addition, man experiences life through division and conflict, including his relationship with others, and his divided view of spirit and life.<ref name="Aurobindo 2006 10"/>

== Influence ==
Sri Aurobindo's influence has been wide-ranging. In India, [[Shishir Kumar Maitra|S. K. Maitra]], Anilbaran Roy and [[D. P. Chattopadhyaya]] commented on Sri Aurobindo's work. Writers on [[esotericism]] and traditional wisdom, such as [[Mircea Eliade]], [[Paul Brunton]], and [[Rene Guenon]], all saw him as an authentic representative of the Indian spiritual tradition.<ref>Peter Heehs, ''The Lives of Sri Aurobindo'' p.379</ref>

[[Haridas Chaudhuri]] and [[Frederic Spiegelberg]]<ref>Haridas Chaudhuri and Frederic Spiegelberg, ''The integral philosophy of Sri Aurobindo: a commemorative symposium'', Allen & Unwin, 1960</ref>  were among those who were inspired by Sri Aurobindo, who worked on the newly formed American Academy of Asian Studies in San Francisco. Soon after, Chaudhuri and his wife Bina established the Cultural Integration Fellowship, from which later emerged the [[California Institute of Integral Studies]].<ref>"From the American Academy of Asian Studies to the California Institute of Integral Studies"[http://www.well.com/~davidu/aaas-ciis.html]</ref>

[[Karlheinz Stockhausen]] became heavily inspired by the writings of Satprem about Sri Aurobindo during a week in May 1968, a time of which the composer was undergoing a personal crisis and had found Aurobindos philosophies were relevant to his feelings at the time.

=== Organisations and institutes ===
:* Sri Aurobindo International Centre of Education, an integral part of the Ashram, serves as a field of experiment and research in education. For years Sri Aurobindo considered forming an Education Centre to prepare future humanity to manifest upon earth a divine consciousness and a divine life. To give a concrete shape to his vision, the Mother opened a school for children on 2 December 1943. In 1951, a Convention at Pondicherry resolved to establish an International University Centre in the town as a fitting memorial to Sri Aurobindo. Accordingly, the Sri Aurobindo International University Centre was inaugurated by the Mother on 6 January 1952. In 1959, the Mother renamed it "Sri Aurobindo International Centre of Education".<ref>{{cite web | title =Sri Aurobindo International Centre of Education | url =http://www.sriaurobindoashram.org/ashram/saice/index.php | date = | accessdate = 03/01/2013 }}</ref>

== Critics ==
In his paper "Sri Auribindo's Theory of Evolution - A  Criticism" by Prof. [[N. R. Malkani|Malkani]], he says Aurobindo's theory of creation is not true, as the theory talks about experiences and visions which are beyond normal human experiences. He says his theory is an intellectual response to a difficult problem; according to Prof. [[N. R. Malkani|Malkani]] Aurobindo uses the trait of unpredictability in theorising and discussing things not based upon truth of existence;  and states that awareness is already a reality and suggests there would be not need to examine the creative activity subjected to awareness<ref>{{cite web | title =  SRI AUROBINDO<U+2019>S THEORY OF EVOLUTION - A  CRITICISM  BY  Prof. MALKANI  EXAMINED | url = http://www.drkcv.org/Books/kcv4chap_6.htm | accessdate = 06/02/2014}}</ref>

[[Ken Wilber]] rejects the notion of different level of matter, life, mind, overmind, supermind proposed by Aurobindo in his book [[The Life Divine|The life divine]], and terms them as higher or lower nested [[holon]]s and states there is only a fourfold reality.<ref>{{cite web | title =  Wilber's Critique of Sri Aurobindo | url = http://www.kheper.net/topics/Wilber/Wilber_on_Aurobindo.htmlm | accessdate = 06/02/2014}}</ref>

[[Adi da]] finds that Sri Aurobindo's contributions were merely literary and cultural and had extended his political motivation into spirituality and human evolution <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.beezone.com/DawnHorse/aurobindo.htm|title=BUBBA FREE JOHN IN INDIA|work= The Dawn Horse Magazine|date=4 August 1974|accessdate=6 March 2014}}</ref>

[[Osho]] says that Sri Aurobindo was a great scholar but was never realised and his personal ego had made him indirectly claim that he went beyond [[buddha]] and is said to have believed himself to be enlightened due to increasing number of followers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://oshosearch.net/Convert/Articles_Osho/Beyond_Enlightenment/Osho-Beyond-Enlightenment-00000017.html|title=Osho Beyond Enlightenment|work= Beyond Enlightenment |accessdate=6 March 2014}}</ref>

=== The Life Divine ===
''[[The Life Divine]]'' is a combination of summarisation of the letters published in [[Arya (journal)|Arya]] and interpretation of [[Isha Upanishad]] and is one of  Sri Aurobindo's major philosophical opus. It tries to decipher the process of [[evolution]] and nature of [[reality]] and to give a  [[metaphysical]] intepretation of upanishads along with his own experiences. It is divided into two parts, the first explaining nature of [[reality]] and the second part on [[knowledge]] and evolution.  In the first part disseminating creation & the nature of reality, analysis about human aspiration & current system of [[Spirtuality|spirtuality]], there repercussions in understanding of [[reality]]. proposes different levels of reality and in eventuality of Humans rising to these different levels of reality. Analysis the interplay of reality and the [[Human nature|nature of human]]. and the second part describes [[evolution]] and [[knowledge]], how the knowledge has been intepreted and the reason for the way it is. Finally hints of existence of a higher consiousness which would include all in reality and make sense of everything in [[reality]], and calls this as a possible bringing down of Divine life on earth. <ref>{{cite book  | last =Aurobindo  | first = Sri | authorlink = Sri Aurobindo | title = The life divine  | publisher = Sri Aurobindo Ashram Publication Department  | series =  | volume = 21 & 22 | edition = 2 | date = 1960 | location = Pondicherry | pages = 1117 | language = English  | url = http://www.sriaurobindoashram.org/ashram/sriauro/writings.php | }}</ref>
