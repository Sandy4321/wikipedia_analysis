'''HMS ''Cygnet'' (H83)''' was a [[C and D class destroyer|C class]] [[destroyer]] built for the [[Royal Navy]] in the early 1930s. The ship was initially assigned to the [[Home Fleet]], although she was temporarily deployed in the [[Red Sea]] during the [[Abyssinia Crisis]] of 1935<U+2013>36. ''Cygnet'' was sold to the [[Royal Canadian Navy]] (RCN) in late 1937 and renamed HMCS ''St. Laurent''. She was stationed on the west coast of Canada when [[World War II]] began in September 1939, and had to be transferred to the [[Atlantic]] coast for convoy escort duties. She served as a convoy escort in the [[Battle of the Atlantic (1939<U+2013>1945)|Battle of the Atlantic]] and participated in the sinking of two German submarines. The ship was on anti-submarine patrols during the [[invasion of Normandy]], and was employed as a troop transport after [[Victory in Europe Day|VE Day]] for returning Canadian servicemen. ''St. Laurent'' was [[Ship decommissioning|decommissioned]] in late 1945 and [[ship breaking|scrapped]] in 1947.

==Design and construction==
''Cygnet'' displaced {{convert|1375|LT|t}} at [[Displacement (ship)|standard]] load and {{convert|1865|LT|t}} at [[deep load]]. The ship had an [[length overall|overall length]] of {{convert|329|ft|m|1}}, a [[beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|33|ft|m|1}} and a [[draft (hull)|draught]] of {{convert|12|ft|6|in|m|1}}. She was powered by [[Parsons Marine Steam Turbine Company|Parsons]] geared [[steam turbine]]s, driving two shafts, which developed a total of {{convert|36000|shp|lk=in}} and gave a maximum speed of {{convert|36|kn|lk=in}}. Steam for the turbines was provided by three Admiralty 3-drum [[water-tube boiler]]s. ''Cygnet'' carried a maximum of {{convert|473|LT|t}} of [[fuel oil]] that gave her a range of {{convert|5500|nmi|lk=in}} at {{convert|15|kn}}. The ship's complement was 145 officers and men.<ref name=w78>Whitley, p. 26</ref>

The ship mounted four 45-[[caliber (artillery)|calibre]] [[4.7 inch QF Mark XII|4.7-inch Mk IX guns]] in single mounts, designated 'A', 'B', 'X', and 'Y' from front to rear. For [[Anti-aircraft warfare|anti-aircraft]] (AA) defence, ''Cygnet'' had a single [[QF 3 inch 20 cwt|QF 3-inch 20 cwt]]<ref group=Note>"cwt" is the abbreviation for [[hundredweight]], 30 cwt referring to the weight of the gun.</ref> AA gun between her [[funnel (ship)|funnel]]s, and two {{convert|40|mm|adj=on|1}} [[QF 2 pounder naval gun|QF 2-pounder Mk II]] AA guns mounted on the aft end of her [[forecastle]] deck. The {{convert|3|in|adj=on}} AA gun was removed in 1936 and the 2-pounders were relocated to between the funnels. She was fitted with two above-water quadruple [[torpedo tube]] mounts for [[British 21 inch torpedo|21-inch torpedoes]].<ref>Lenton, p. 154</ref> Three depth-charge chutes were fitted, each with a capacity of two [[depth charge]]s. After World War II began this was increased to 33 depth charges, delivered by one or two rails and two throwers.<ref>Friedman, pp. 209, 236, 298<U+2013>99</ref>

The ship was ordered on 15 July 1930 from [[Vickers-Armstrongs]], [[Barrow-in-Furness]] under the 1929 Programme. ''Cygnet'' was [[Keel|laid down]] on 1 December 1930, [[Ship naming and launching|launched]] on 29 September 1931,<ref name=e45>English, p. 45</ref> as the 14th ship to carry the name,<ref>Colledge, p. 87</ref> and completed on 1 April 1932.<ref name=e45/>

==Service history==
After the ship commissioned on 9 April 1932, she was assigned to the [[2nd Destroyer Flotilla]] of the Home Fleet. ''Cygnet'' spent a lot of time in dockyard hands during her first two years of service. She was repaired at [[HMNB Devonport|Devonport]] in November 1932&nbsp;<U+2013> January 1933, March<U+2013>May, July<U+2013>August and November 1933&nbsp;<U+2013> January 1934 before deploying to the [[West Indies]] with the Home Fleet between January and March 1934. The ship required more repairs upon her return in April<U+2013>May and then a refit from 25 July to 31 August 1934. ''Cygnet'' was detached from the Home Fleet during the Abyssinian Crisis, and deployed in the Red Sea from September 1935 to April 1936. The ship returned to the UK in April 1936 and refitted at Devonport between 20 April and 18 June before resuming duty with the Home Fleet. In July<U+2013>August she was deployed for patrol duties off the Spanish coast in the [[Bay of Biscay]] to intercept shipping carrying contraband goods to Spain and to protect British-flagged shipping during the first stages of the [[Spanish Civil War]].<ref name=e0>English, p. 50</ref>

===Transfer to the Royal Canadian Navy===
Together with her sister {{HMS|Crescent|1931|6}}, ''Cygnet'' was sold to Canada on 20 October 1936 for a total price of <U+00A3>400,000. She was refitted again to meet Canadian standards,<ref name=e0/> including the installation of [[List of British Asdic systems|Type 124]] [[ASDIC]],<ref>Brown, p. 164</ref> and handed over on 1 February 1937. The ship was renamed as HMCS ''St. Laurent'' and commissioned into the RCN on 17 February. ''St. Laurent'' was assigned to [[City of Halifax|Halifax]], [[Nova Scotia]] and arrived there in May. She remained there for a year before she was transferred to [[CFB Esquimalt|Esquimalt]] in 1938.<ref name=e0/> The ship remained there until she was ordered to the [[Atlantic Canada|East Coast]] on 31 August 1939, arriving at Halifax on 18 September. ''St. Laurent'' escorted local convoys while based there, including the convoy carrying half of the [[1st Canadian Infantry Division]] to the UK on 10 December. The ship was ordered to [[Plymouth]] on 24 May 1940 and arrived there on 31 May. Upon arrival, the ship's rear torpedo tube mount was removed and replaced by a 12-pounder AA gun and the 2-pounders were exchanged for quadruple Mark I mounts for the [[Vickers .50 machine gun|QF 0.5-inch Vickers Mark III]] [[machine gun]].<ref>Douglas, pp. 52, 68, 96<U+2013>97</ref>

On 9 June, ''St. Laurent'' was ordered to [[Le Havre]], France to evacuate British troops, but none were to be found and the ship evacuated a small group of French soldiers further up the coast on 11 June. The ship was taken under fire by a German artillery battery near [[Saint-Valery-en-Caux]], but she was not hit and [[Lieutenant Commander]] [[Harry DeWolf|H.G. DeWolf]], the ship's captain, ordered her to return fire although no results were noted. After returning to England, ''St. Laurent'' escorted several troop convoys on the last legs of their journeys from Canada, Australia and New Zealand in mid-June and was assigned to escort duties with Western Approaches Command afterwards.<ref>Douglas, pp. 97<U+2013>98</ref>

On 2 July, whilst escorting the British [[battleship]] {{HMS|Nelson|28|2}}, ''St. Laurent'' received word that the unescorted British passenger ship {{SS|Arandora Star}} had been torpedoed by {{Ship|German submarine|U-47|1938|2}}, about {{convert|125|nmi}} northeast of [[Malin Head]], [[Ireland]]. Arriving some four and a half hours after the [[ocean liner]] sank, the ship rescued 857 survivors, including German and Italian [[prisoners of war]]. Together with the British [[sloop]] {{HMS|Sandwich|L12|2}}, she badly damaged the {{GS|U-52|1939|6}} whilst defending Convoy HX 60 on 4 August. On 2 December, ''St. Laurent'' rescued survivors from the [[armed merchant cruiser]] {{HMS|Forfar|F30|6}} that had been torpedoed and sunk by {{GS|U-99|1940|2}} as well survivors from the British [[oil tanker]] ''Conch''.<ref>Douglas, pp. 101<U+2013>04, 127<U+2013>28</ref>

After refitting at Halifax from 3 March to 11 July 1941, ''St. Laurent'' was assigned to the 14th [[escort group (naval)|Escort Group]] of the RCN's [[Dominion of Newfoundland|Newfoundland]] Escort Force which covered convoys in the Mid-Atlantic.<ref name=e0/> Whilst escorting Convoy ON 33 in November in a [[gale]], the ship was damaged severely enough by the weather that she was forced to return to Halifax for repairs.<ref>Douglas, p. 298</ref> ''St. Laurent'' was transferred to the Mid-Ocean Escort Force in December and remained until March 1943. She was given a lengthy refit at Halifax in April<U+2013>August 1942.<ref name=e0/> In early December 1942, the ship's [[List of British ordnance terms#DCT|director-control tower]] and [[rangefinder]] were exchanged for a [[Type 271 radar|Type 271]] target indication [[radar]] mounted above the [[bridge (nautical)|bridge]]. By this time, she had been fitted with a [[high-frequency direction finding]] system as well. Whilst assigned to Escort Group C1 defending [[Convoy ON 154]] in late December 1942, ''St. Laurent'' had her first victory on 27 December 1942 when she was credited with sinking {{Ship|German submarine|U-356||2}} while north of the [[Azores]].<ref>Douglas, pp. 568<U+2013>70</ref>

The ship was refitted in [[Dartmouth, Nova Scotia]] between 17 August and December 1943. On 10 March 1944, ''St. Laurent'' was credited with sinking {{Ship|German submarine|U-845||2}} in the North Atlantic, along with the destroyer {{HMS|Forester|H74|6}}, and [[frigate]]s {{HMCS|Owen Sound|K340|6}} and {{HMCS|Swansea|K328|6}}.<ref name=e0/>

[[File:HMCS St. Laurent IKMD-04188.jpg|thumb|left|Late-war photo of ''St. Laurent'']]
The other changes made to the ship's armament during the war (exactly when these occurred is unknown) included the replacement of 'B' gun by a [[Hedgehog (weapon)|Hedgehog]] anti-submarine [[spigot mortar]], exchanging the two quadruple .50-calibre Vickers machine guns mounted between her funnels for two Oerlikon 20&nbsp;mm AA guns, the addition of two Oerlikon guns to her [[searchlight]] platform and another pair were fitted on the wings of her bridge, and the removal of her 12-pounder AA gun. [[Type 286 radar|Type 286]] short-range surface search radar was also added.<ref>Lenton, pp. 154<U+2013>55</ref> 'Y' gun was also removed to allow her depth charge stowage to be increased to at least 60 depth charges.<ref>Friedman, p. 237</ref>

In May 1944 she was transferred to the 11th Escort Group to support the Allied [[Normandy landings|landings in Normandy]]. On D-Day itself&nbsp;<U+2013> 6 June 1944&nbsp;<U+2013> she was deployed with the Canadian destroyers {{HMCS|Chaudi<U+00E8>re|H99|2}}, {{HMCS|Gatineau|H61|2}}, {{HMCS|Kootenay|H75|2}} and {{HMCS|Ottawa|H31|2}} stationed in the entrance to the [[English Channel]] to prevent U-boat attacks on the invasion convoys. Later she was deployed with her group in the [[Bay of Biscay]] for anti-submarine operations. On 8 August she was unsuccessfully attacked by a [[glide bomb]], and on the 13th she and ''Ottawa'' rescued survivors from {{Ship|German submarine|U-270||2}} which had been sunk with depth charges by a [[Short Sunderland|Sunderland]] aircraft. These duties continued into October, when she returned to Canada to refit. Conducted at [[Shelburne, Nova Scotia]], the refit lasted from November 1944 to 20 March 1945. ''St. Laurent'' returned to service in April 1945, and was attached to the Halifax Escort Force for convoy defence off the east coast. After the German surrender on 6 May, she was employed as a troop transport, until paid off on 10 October 1945. The ship was sold for scrap and broken up in 1947.<ref name=e0/>
