'''Angela Khalia Hucles''' (born 5 July 1978, in [[Virginia Beach]], [[Virginia]]) (pronounced HUE-clees) is a former [[United States|American]] [[association football|soccer]] [[midfielder]] and member of the [[United States women's national soccer team]].

==Early life==
Hucles graduated from [[Norfolk Academy]] in 1996.  She played college soccer at the [[University of Virginia]], where she was a four-year all-conference player.  Hucles is still Virginia's career women's leader in goals, game-winning goals, and total points.

==Club career==
After graduating from Virginia in 2000, Hucles played for [[Hampton Roads Piranhas]] of the [[W-League]].  She led the league in assists with 7, playing in 14 games and scoring 6 goals.

Hucles was then drafted in the 2001 WUSA Inaugural Draft in the 12th round (93rd overall) by [[Boston Breakers (WUSA)|Boston Breakers]] of the newly-formed [[Women's United Soccer Association]].  She went on to make 57 total appearances for the club, scoring 6 goals.  She scored the first goal in the history of the organization on 6 March 2001 in a preseason exhibition against [[Duke Blue Devils]].  In her first season, Hucles appeared in 21 games, starting 19 of them, and finished with two goals and no assists.  2002 saw Hucles appear in 19 games, starting 17, and finished with three goals and four assists.  In 2003, Hucles appeared in 17 games, all starts, and scored one goal and assisted on 4 more.  Unfortunately, after the 2003 season the WUSA ceased operations.

Hucles returned to a club in 2005 when she turned out for [[Boston Renegades]].  She only appeared in 5 games in 2005, but notched 3 goals and an assist.  In 2006, Hucles had a much more productive season, appearing in 11 games and tallying 10 goals and two assists.

In 2008, [[Women's Professional Soccer]] established itself.  Hucles, along with [[United States women's national soccer team|US National Team]] players [[Kristine Lilly]] and [[Heather Mitts]], were allocated to [[Boston Breakers (WPS)|Boston Breakers]] on 16 September 2006.  The league kicked off in 2009, which saw Hucles appear in 19 games, all starts, and score two goals and an assist.  Following the conclusion of the season, on 16 October 2009, Hucles abruptly announced her retirement from both club and international soccer.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.ussoccer.com/News/Womens-National-Team/2009/10/Angela-Hucles-Retires-From-Professional-Soccer.aspx |title=Angela Hucles Retires From Professional Soccer |date=16 October 2009 |publisher=[[United States Soccer Federation]] |accessdate=25 October 2009}}</ref>

==International career==
With the [[United States women's national soccer team|United States Women's National Team]], Hucles won 2 Olympic Gold medals and 2 World Cups.

Hucles made her first appearance for the United States on 27 April 2002 against [[Finland women's national football team|Finland]].  She went on to appear in 109 total matches for the United States, with the last coming on 22 July 2009 against [[Canada women's national soccer team|Canada]].

She was a member of the U.S. squad at the [[2003 FIFA Women's World Cup]], but did not play in the tournament due to a shin injury.  She was a member of the Gold medal winning United States team for the [[2004 Summer Olympics]], appearing in two games in [[Athens]], and was also a member of the [[2007 FIFA Women's World Cup]] squad.  However, her biggest role with the United States came in the [[2008 Summer Olympics]] in [[Beijing]].  Hucles was expected to play a backup role with the squad, but an injury to [[Abby Wambach]] forced Hucles into a starting position.  She responded by scoring four goals, including two against [[Japan women's national football team|Japan]] in the semi-finals.  Her efforts helped the United States to the Gold medal and she finished 2nd in goals scored to only [[Cristiane Rozeira de Souza Silva|Cristiane]].

Her retirement came on 16 October 2009, when she announced her retirement from both club and international soccer.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.ussoccer.com/News/Womens-National-Team/2009/10/Angela-Hucles-Retires-From-Professional-Soccer.aspx |title=Angela Hucles Retires From Professional Soccer |date=16 October 2009 |publisher=[[United States Soccer Federation]] |accessdate=25 October 2009}}</ref>
