The '''1994<U+2013>95 South-West Indian Ocean cyclone season''' was fairly active, with storms [[tropical cyclogenesis|forming]] regularly from October through April. It was much less damaging than [[1993<U+2013>94 South-West Indian Ocean cyclone season|its predecessor]], and most of the storms in the season remained over water or only brushed land. The first system was Tropical Depression A1, which formed in October and passed north of Madagascar. The first [[tropical cyclone naming|named storm]] was Albertine, which formed on November&nbsp;23 in the northeastern portion of the basin and became one of three [[Tropical cyclone scales#South-Western Indian Ocean|intense tropical cyclones]]. The last storm was Marlene, which was also an intense tropical cyclone and dissipated on April&nbsp;11.

Most of the storms originated from the [[intertropical convergence zone]]. In late December into early January, tropical storms Bentha and Christelle persisted to the east of Madagascar, undergoing the [[Fujiwhara effect]] with each other. Later in January, Dorina became the second of three intense tropical cyclones, but weakened before passing near [[Rodrigues]]. Tropical Depression Eliceca and Tropical Storm Fodah both formed in the [[Mozambique Channel]] toward the end of January, bringing gusty winds and rainfall to the region. In February, Gail produced gusty winds on Rodrigues, and Tropical Storm Heida entered the basin from [[1994<U+2013>95 Australian region cyclone season|Australian region]]. Later in the month, Ingrid brought strong winds to [[Mauritius]]. Tropical storms Josta and Kylie developed toward the beginning of March from the same overall system, affecting Madagascar and R<U+00E9>union, respectively. After they dissipated, Tropical Depression Lidy caused flooding and damage on Rodrigues due to heavy rainfall.

During the year, the [[M<U+00E9>t<U+00E9>o-France]] office on [[R<U+00E9>union]] (MFR) issued warnings for tropical systems in the region as the [[Regional Specialised Meteorological Centre]].<ref name="report">{{cite report|author=Guy Le Goff|year=1995|publisher=[[M<U+00E9>t<U+00E9>o-France]]|title=1994-1995 Cyclone Season in the South-West Indian Ocean|accessdate=2014-05-03|url=http://www.meteo.fr/temps/domtom/La_Reunion/webcmrs9.0/anglais/archives/publications/saisons_cycloniques/index19941995.html}}</ref> In the year, MFR tracked tropical cyclones south of the equator from the coast of Africa to 90<U+00BA>&nbsp;[[Longitude|E]].<ref>{{cite report|author=Philippe Caroff, et al.|date=June 2011|title=Operational procedures of TC satellite analysis at RSMC La Reunion|publisher=World Meteorological Organization|accessdate=2013-05-05|url=http://www.wmo.int/pages/prog/www/tcp/documents/RSMCLaReunionforIWSATC.pdf|format=PDF}}</ref> The [[Joint Typhoon Warning Center]] (JTWC) also issued warnings in an unofficial capacity.<ref name="atcr">{{cite report|author=[[Joint Typhoon Warning Center]]|publisher=United States Navy|accessdate=2014-05-08|title=Annual Tropical Cyclone Report|year=1995|chapter=South Pacific And South Indian Ocean Tropical Cyclones|url=http://www.usno.navy.mil/NOOC/nmfc-ph/RSS/jtwc/atcr/1995atcr.pdf|format=PDF}}</ref>

Several of the storms in the season affected the island of [[Rodrigues]], an [[Outer islands of Mauritius|outer island]] of [[Mauritius]]; however, only one &ndash; Tropical Depression Lidy &ndash; caused damage after dropping heavy rainfall. The season as a whole was much less damaging than [[1993<U+2013>94 South-West Indian Ocean cyclone season|the preceding season]]. There were 58&nbsp;days in which a storm or cyclone was active, 17 above normal. There were 11&nbsp;systems that became [[Tropical cyclone scales#South-Western Indian Ocean|moderate tropical storms]], two above the normal of 9. The six tropical cyclones &ndash; a storm with winds of 120&nbsp;km/h (75&nbsp;mph) &ndash; was also above the average of five.<ref name="report"/>

The [[intertropical convergence zone]] (ITCZ) became active toward the end of November, spawning a [[low pressure area]] on November&nbsp;23 about 400&nbsp;km (250&nbsp;mi) east of [[Diego Garcia]]. This system quickly organized into a tropical disturbance, aided by favorable conditions.<ref name="report"/> On November&nbsp;24, the JTWC began classifying it as Tropical Cyclone 02S.<ref name="atcr"/> The next day, the system intensified into Tropical Storm Albertine while moving southwestward, steered by a [[ridge (meteorology)|ridge]] to the southeast. Late on November&nbsp;25, an [[eye (cyclone)|eye]] developed in the center of the convection, and Albertine intensified to tropical cyclone status the next day. The eye gradually became better organized, attaining a diameter of 90&nbsp;km (55&nbsp;mi) on November&nbsp;28 as Albertine became an intense tropical cyclone.<ref name="report"/> At that time, the MFR estimated peak 10&ndash;minute winds of 175&nbsp;km/h (110&nbsp;mph),<ref name="abt">{{cite report|author=Kenneth R.

Toward the end of December, the [[Near-equatorial trough|equatorial trough]] spawned two areas of convection &ndash; one persisted southwest of Diego Garcia, which would become Tropical Storm Bentha, and the other persisted between [[Agalega]] and the [[Farquhar Group]] in the [[Seychelles]]. The latter system organized into Tropical Disturbance B1 on December&nbsp;27, but wind shear in the region prevented significant development and dislocated the center from the thunderstorms. A ridge to the southeast steered the disturbance slowly southwestward toward Madagascar. As it neared the country, the system turned westward and intensified into a tropical depression after developing a spiral band of convection. On January&nbsp;2, the depression made landfall near [[Antalaha]] in northeastern Madagascar, and quickly weakened over land.<ref name="report"/>

The system moved to the northeast and looped back to the east, [[Fujiwhara effect|influenced]] by developing Tropical Storm Bentha. On January&nbsp;4, after Bentha was named, the system was renamed Tropical Disturbance C1. Convection gradually reorganized over the center as the two storms interacted and moved cyclonically around each other. The disturbance intensified after Bentha began weakening,<ref name="report"/> becoming Tropical Storm Christelle on January&nbsp;5.<ref name="cbt">{{cite report|author=Kenneth R.

The center passed near Mauritius on January&nbsp;8 as a tropical depression. Two days later, a [[cold front]] steered the system to the southeast, absorbing it after Christelle became extratropical on January&nbsp;11.<ref name="report"/>

Both Bentha and Christelle brought gusty winds and rainfall to Mauritius, and caused R<U+00E9>union to be under a cyclone watch for five days.<ref name="report"/> The system also produced rainfall and landslides in Madagascar.<ref>{{cite news|title=Weatherwatch: A Wet Start in the States|date=1995-01-10|newspaper=The London Guardian}}{{subscription required|via=LexisNexis}}</ref>

The same broad system that spawned Christelle also produced an area of convection southwest of Diego Garcia toward the end of December.

The ITCZ spawned an area of convection and a vortex in the northeastern portion of the basin on January&nbsp;18, which organized into a tropical disturbance that day. It initially moved southeastward under the influence of the [[monsoon]], although it gradually recurved back to the southwest. On January&nbsp;19, the system intensified into Tropical Storm Dorina,<ref name="report"/> and on the next day the JTWC initiated advisories on it as Tropical Cyclone 08S.<ref name="atcr"/> Dorina quickly intensified into a tropical cyclone by January&nbsp;21,<ref name="dbt">{{cite report|author=Kenneth R.

After moving over an area of cooler waters, Dorina began weakening, indicated by the previously well-defined eye becoming ragged. On January&nbsp;24, the cyclone weakened into a severe tropical storm. The motion became more west-southwesterly after the ridge weakened. A passing trough increased shear over Dorina, which caused further weakening and for the convection to deteriorate. However, conditions became more favorable on January&nbsp;27, allowing Dorina to re-intensify slightly as it redeveloped an eye feature. On that day, the storm passed about 250&nbsp;km (155&nbsp;mi) south of Rodrigues, producing gusts of 115&nbsp;km/h (70&nbsp;mph). Subsequently, Dorina turned back to the southwest and later to the south, influenced by another passing trough that had absorbed Tropical Storm Fodah. Strong wind shear caused the storm to weaken again. On January&nbsp;31, Dorina became extratropical while turning to the southeast and was later absorbed into the trough.<ref name="report"/>

After the remnants of Tropical Depression Eliceca dissipated over Madagascar, an area of disturbed weather persisted over the Mozambique Channel, spawning a low pressure area near [[Juan de Nova Island]] on January&nbsp;21.

An extended series of low pressure areas spawned what would become Tropical Storm Josta on March&nbsp;5 near the Comoros in the northern Mozambique Channel. It initially drifted westward while slowly organizing, becoming a tropical storm on March&nbsp;7.<ref name="report"/> On that day, the JTWC classified Josta as Tropical Cyclone 16S.<ref name="atcr"/> On March&nbsp;8, Josta approached the coast of [[Mozambique]] within 90&nbsp;km (55&nbsp;mi) of [[Pemba, Mozambique|Pemba]] before turning abruptly to the east-southeast. The convection fluctuated in intensity, eventually becoming better organized on March&nbsp;9. That day, an eye feature formed in the center of the convection,<ref name="report"/> and the MFR estimated peak winds of 105&nbsp;km/h (65&nbsp;mph). By contrast, the JTWC upgraded Josta to the equivalent of a minimal hurricane with winds of 120&nbsp;km/h (75&nbsp;mph).<ref name="jbt">{{cite report|author=Kenneth R. Knapp|author2=Michael C.

On March&nbsp;10, the storm re-intensified slightly, aided by the monsoon, as it passed 160&nbsp;km (100&nbsp;mi) south of [[Mayotte]]. It again weakened soon thereafter, with the convection spreading ahead of the circulation over Madagascar. On March&nbsp;12, the circulation dissipated off the northwest coast of Madagascar, partially due to the influence of the stronger Kylie to the southeast.<ref name="report"/> Rains from the storm reached {{convert|270|mm|in|abbr=on}} along the coast of Madagascar, despite the storm not making landfall.<ref name="eww">{{cite news|author=Steve Newman|title=Earthweek: Diary of the planet|date=1995-03-18|newspaper=Toronto Star}}{{subscription required|via=LexisNexis}}</ref>

The same overall system that spawned Josta also produced a disturbance on March&nbsp;6 off the east coast of Madagascar. While drifting southeastward within a trough, the system slowly organized until becoming a tropical storm on March&nbsp;7,<ref name="report"/><ref name="kbt">{{cite report|author=Kenneth R.

The convection organized on March&nbsp;10 into a central dense overcast,<Ref name="report"/> and the next day attained peak winds of 85&nbsp;km/h (50&nbsp;mph), according to the MFR. By contrast, the JTWC assessed Kylie as becoming much stronger, reaching winds of 160&nbsp;km/h (100&nbsp;mph).<ref name="kbt"/> Subsequently, a trough turned the storm to the southwest, bringing it over the island of R<U+00E9>union on March&nbsp;13. Increased wind shear deteriorated the convection as the storm turned to the southeast on March&nbsp;14. The next day, Kylie was absorbed by the trough.<ref name="report"/>

On R<U+00E9>union, Kylie produced rainfall along with gusts of over 100&nbsp;km/h (65&nbsp;km/h),<Ref name="report"/> along with high waves.<ref name="eww"/> The storm prompted classes to be canceled, as well as for the airport to be closed, causing flights to be canceled.<ref>{{cite news|title=Schools closed as cyclone approaches Reunion|date=1995-03-13|agency=Agence France-Presse}}{{subscription required|via=LexisNexis}}</ref>

The final storm of the season formed on March&nbsp;29 from the ITCZ to the east of Diego Garcia. The large area of convection quickly became more organized, intensifying into Tropical Storm Marlene on March&nbsp;30.<ref name="report"/> On that date, the JTWC classified it as Tropical Cyclone 19S.<ref name="atcr"/> Marlene continued to strengthen as it moved west-southwestward, aided by a surge in the monsoon. An eye formed on March&nbsp;31, and on the next day the storm became a tropical cyclone. The eye reached a diameter of 25&nbsp;km (15&nbsp;mi), embedded within a well-defined central dense overcast. Later on April&nbsp;1, Marlene became an intense tropical cyclone, just three days after its genesis. That day, it turned to the south due to a passing trough. Less favorable conditions caused Marlene to weaken on April&nbsp;2, although it re-intensified the next day.<ref name="report"/> The MFR estimated peak winds of 185&nbsp;km/h (115&nbsp;mph), and the JTWC estimated winds of 230&nbsp;km/h (145&nbsp;mph).<Ref>{{cite report|author=Kenneth R.

On April&nbsp;5, Marlene was downgraded into a severe tropical storm and subsequently drifted to the northwest, influenced by a ridge behind the trough. Two days later, the storm turned to the southeast and later to the east, gradually weakening into a tropical depression. On April&nbsp;11, a passing trough absorbed Marlene in the eastern periphery of the basin.<ref name="report"/>

===Other storms===
[[File:TD A1 1994.PNG|right|thumb|Satellite image of Tropical Depression A1]]
On October&nbsp;1, an area of convection developed about {{convert|500|km|mi|abbr=on}} Seychelles at a low latitude. Moving southwestward, the system organized into Tropical Disturbance A1 on October&nbsp;2, the first of the season. A small central dense overcast subsequently developed over the circulation. A ridge to the south steered the disturbance westward, bringing it just north of the Farquhar Group.<ref name="report"/> On October&nbsp;5, the disturbance intensified into a tropical depression, reaching peak winds of 55&nbsp;km/h (35&nbsp;mph).<Ref>{{cite report|author=Kenneth R. Knapp|author2=Michael C. Kruk|author3=David H. Levinson|author4=Howard J. Diamond|author5=Charles J.

On October&nbsp;7, the circulation dissipated. There were two other disturbances between October and late November.<ref name="report"/>

There was a tropical disturbance in the first two weeks of January before Dorina formed. Later in the month, the ITCZ spawned an area of convection in the northern Mozambique Channel near the Comoros. A circulation formed within the system on January&nbsp;20 near the western coast of Madagascar, quickly becoming a tropical depression. That day, the Meteorological Service of Madagascar named the system Eliceca, but the depression quickly moved inland and dissipated. Two disturbances formed in February after the development of Heida and before Ingrid formed.<ref name="report"/>

The ITCZ later produced a disturbance northeast of Rodrigues after Kylie dissipated on March&nbsp;14. It intensified into a tropical depression as it moved southwestward. Due to the threat to Rodrigues, the Mauritius Meteorological Service named the depression Lidy on March&nbsp;15, although wind shear in the region prevented further strengthening. It produced gusty winds while passing near Rodrigues on March&nbsp;16, and subsequently looped near the island. Convection from Lidy produced {{convert|200|mm|in|abbr=on}} of rainfall, causing flooding in some areas on Rodrigues. The rains caused erosion and the most damage on the island of any storm in the season. Later, Lidy drifted to the west in the [[trade wind]]s, dissipating on March&nbsp;20 to the north of R<U+00E9>union. After Lidy, there was one final non-developing disturbance.<ref name="report"/>

==Storm names==
A tropical disturbance is named when it reaches moderate tropical storm strength. If a tropical disturbance reaches moderate tropical storm status west of [[55th meridian east|55<U+00B0>E]], then the Sub-regional Tropical Cyclone Advisory Centre in [[Madagascar]] assigns the appropriate name to the storm. If a tropical disturbance reaches moderate tropical storm status between [[55th meridian east|55<U+00B0>E]] and [[90th meridian east|90<U+00B0>E]], then the Sub-regional Tropical Cyclone Advisory Centre in [[Mauritius]] assigns the appropriate name to the storm. A new annual list is used every year, so no names are retired.<ref>{{cite report|author=Guy Le Goff|year=1994|publisher=M<U+00E9>t<U+00E9>o-France|title=1993-1994 Cyclone Season in the South-West Indian Ocean|page=92|accessdate=2014-05-08|url=http://www.meteo.fr/temps/domtom/La_Reunion/webcmrs9.0/anglais/archives/publications/saisons_cycloniques/index19931994.html}}</ref>
