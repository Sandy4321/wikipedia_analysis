'''Coal balls''' are [[calcium]]-rich masses of [[Permineralisation|permineralised]] life forms, frequently having<!-- freq. found might mean they are found frequently--> a round shape. As such, coal balls are not made of coal, despite what the name implies. Coal balls were formed 300 million years ago, in the [[Carboniferous]] era. They can preserve organic matter exceptionally well, which renders them useful to scientists, who cut and peel the coal balls to research the geological past of the [[Earth]].

In 1855, two English scientists, [[Joseph Dalton Hooker]] and [[Edward William Binney]], discovered coal balls in England, and thereafter the initial research on coal balls was carried out in Europe. Coal balls were eventually discovered and identified in [[North America]] in 1922. Since then, coal balls have been discovered in other countries and several theories on their formation have been proposed.

Coal balls can be found in [[coal seam]]s across North America and [[Eurasia]]. North American coal balls are relatively widespread, both [[Stratigraphy|stratigraphically]] and geologically, as compared to coal balls from [[Europe]]. [[Germany]] and former [[Czechoslovakia]] hold the oldest coal balls.

==Discovery==

[[File:Sir Joseph Dalton Hooker.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Portrait of Sir Joseph Dalton Hooker|Sir Joseph Dalton Hooker, who along with Edward William Binney was the first to report on coal balls]]
Coal balls were first reported by Sir [[Joseph Dalton Hooker]] and [[Edward William Binney]] in northern England in 1855, and much of the early work on these objects was done by European scientists.<ref name="weirdtitle" /><ref name="scottrex" /> North American studies on coal balls began in 1922, when coal balls were correctly identified in [[Illinois]]<U+2014>prior to 1922, they were merely reported as "rock masses in the coal seams".<ref name="illinois" /> Since then hundreds of new species were discovered in coal balls in other countries, and multiple [[paleobotany|paleobotanists]] devised theories on the formation of coal balls.<ref name="scottrex" />

==Formation==

Upon discovering [[Westphalian (stage)|Westphalian-age]] coal balls in [[Yorkshire]] and [[Lancashire]], England, Hooker and Binney proposed a theory on how coal balls were formed,<ref name="kansas" /><ref name="weirdtitle" />which is commonly agreed upon in scientific papers.<ref name="illinois" /><ref name="kansas"/><ref name="ohio" />

According to Hooker and Binney, coal balls were formed ''[[in situ]]'' <U+2013> that is, organic matter gently accumulated near a [[peat bog]], which [[permineralisation|permineralised]].<ref name="weirdtitle" /><ref name="kansas" /> Water-containing "mineral matter" was aggregated near a peat bog and buried. When the minerals [[crystallise]]d, the plant material was forced into lumps of stone. This prevented [[:wikt:coalification|coalification]] and preserved the peat, which eventually became a coal ball.<ref name="illinois" /><ref name="creationmagazine" /> The process is considered permineralisation because the plant material is preserved by the surrounding minerals.<ref name="britannica" /> The majority of coal balls are found in coal seams,<ref name="britannica" /> in locations where the peat was not compressed well enough to render the material into coal.<ref name="illinois" /><ref name="thing" />

Besides Hooker and Binney's analysis, [[Marie Carmichael Stopes]] and [[David Meredith Seares Watson]] analysed their own coal ball samples. Like Hooker and Binney they decided that coal balls formed ''in situ'', but added that interaction with a marine environment was necessary for a coal ball to form.<ref name="stopes" />

===Contents===
[[File:Coal ball structures.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Plate-like entities relatively larger than surrounding structures that resemble small bubbles.|Calcite and [[microdolomites]] are common materials found in coal balls]]

Despite what the name implies, coal balls are not made of coal (thus making them nonburnable and useless for fuel),<ref name="thing1" /><ref name="notmeteor" /><ref name="truedino" /> but rather calcium-rich permineralised life forms,<ref name="thing" /> described by James Lomax as "[[calcium carbonate]] and [[iron pyrite]]s in varying proportions, and in a few places (...) a mixture of [[silica]] with carbonate of [[lime (material)|lime]]".<ref name="lomax" />

Coal balls commonly contain [[microdolomite]]s, products of [[aragonite]],<ref name="thing2" /> and masses of organic matter at various stages of [[decomposition]].<ref name="illinois" /><ref name="ohio" /><ref name="berkeley" />Hooker and Binney analysed a sample of a coal ball, finding "a lack of [[coniferous]] wood (...) and fronds of [[fern]]s", and that the discovered plant matter "appeared to [have been arranged] just as they fell from the plants that produced them".<ref name="weirdtitle" />

In 1962, Sergius Mamay and Ellis Yochelson discovered signs of marine animal remains in [[North America]]n coal balls.<ref name="holmes" /><ref name="mamay" /> Their findings reinforced<ref name="scottrex" /> Lomax's proposal on coal ball formation stating that coal balls were formed not ''in situ'', but rather in a marine environment during a large storm.<ref name="lomax" />

===Preservation===

The quality of preservation in coal balls varies from no preservation to the point of being able to analyse the [[cell (biology)|cellular]] structures.<ref name="kansas" /> Some coal balls have been described as "more or less perfectly well-preserved"<ref name="seward" /> and "beautifully anatomically-preserved plants (...) not what used to be the plant&nbsp;<U+2014> it is the plant",<ref name="phillips" /> while others have been described as "[containing] almost no preserved plant remains".<ref name="thing1" />

The quality of the preservation of organic material is decided by the speed of the [[burial]] process and the degree of [[Compression (physical)|compression]] before undergoing permineralisation. Generally, coal balls resulting from remains that have a quick burial with little decay and pressure have a higher preservation degree, although plant remains in most coal balls show various signs of decay and collapse, even in the same coal seam.<ref name="illinois" />

==Distribution==

Coal balls were first found in [[England]]<ref name="weirdtitle" /> and later in other parts of [[Eurasia]], including [[Belgium]], [[Holland]], former [[Czechoslovakia]], [[Germany]], the former [[Soviet Union]], and more recently, [[China]].<ref name="thing1" /><ref name="scottrex" /> They were also encountered in North America, where they are relatively widespread, from the [[Illinois Basin]]<ref name="dimichele" /> to Ohio to the [[Appalachian region]],<ref name="illinois" /> with ages varying from the later [[Stephanian (stage)|Stephanian]] to the later end of the [[Westphalian (stage)|Westphalian]]. On the contrary, European coal balls are generally from the early end of the Westphalian stage.<ref name="scottrex" /> The oldest coal balls were of [[Namurian]] age and were discovered in Germany and former Czechoslovakia.<ref name="scottrex" />

==Analysis==

[[File:Coal ball thin section1.jpg|thumb|alt=A number of thin web-like sheets greatly overlapping each other in one place, in others less. The section of the coal ball resembles broken glass. A thick, dark line can be seen.|A thin section of a coal ball.]]
Fossilised material contained within coal balls can be analysed by cutting the coal ball and extracting thin peels. This is the procedure<ref name="seward" /><ref name="giantbook" /> which was carried out by Hooker and Binney.<ref name="weirdtitle" /> Peels are obtained by grinding and cutting the surface of a coal ball, etching the cut and the surface of the ball with [[hydrochloric acid]], and applying [[acetone]] and a piece of [[cellulose acetate]]. This embeds the cells preserved in the coal ball to the cellulose acetate. Upon drying, the cellulose acetate can be removed from the coal ball and the obtained peel can be [[Staining|stained]] with a low-acidity stain and observed under a [[microscope]].<ref name="ohio" /><ref name="ohio1" /><ref name="smithsonian" />

[[Powder diffraction#X-ray_tubes|X-ray powder diffraction]] can also be used to analyse coal balls.<ref name="thing3" /><ref name="thing4" /> In X-ray diffraction, [[x-ray]]s of a certain predetermined wavelength are sent through a sample to examine its structure. It reveals information about the crystallographic structure, chemical composition, and physical properties of the examined material. A machine observes the [[scattering|scattered]] [[Intensity (physics)|intensity]] of the X-ray, with the result based on a function of incident and scattered angle, polarisation, and wavelength or energy.<ref name="santabarbara" />

[[Thin section]]s of coal balls can also be used for analysis. Thin sections are used to investigate the optical properties of the sample's contents. This is a part of [[petrology]] and helps to reveal the evolution of the sample. A coal ball can be cut with a [[diamond saw]], and the thin section flattened and placed under a [[petrographic microscope]] for examination.<ref name="thing3" /><ref name="journalofgeology" />
