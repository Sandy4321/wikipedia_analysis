'''Edinburgh Trams''' is a [[tram system]] under construction in [[Edinburgh]], Scotland. The first phase of the project consists of a sixteen-station, {{convert|14|km|mi|adj=on}} link between York Place in [[New Town, Edinburgh|New Town]] and [[Edinburgh Airport]].<ref name="bus-station-facts">{{cite web|url=http://www.edinburgh.gov.uk/news/article/1005/edinburgh_bus_station_to_remain_open_during_tram_works|title=Edinburgh bus station to remain open during tram works|date=14 September 2012|accessdate=17 September 2013|work=News centre|publisher=City of Edinburgh|quote=The tramline will have 16 tram stops along its 14 km route, 12 bridges, one underpass and a state-of-the-art depot and control room}}</ref><ref name="traminfoed">{{cite web |url=http://www.edinburgh.gov.uk/info/20236/about_the_trams/1968/about_the_trams |title=The tram service - About the service and the project |publisher=City of Edinburgh Council |accessdate=17 September 2013 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20130828065327/http://www.edinburgh.gov.uk/info/20236/about_the_trams/1968/about_the_trams |archivedate=28 August 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.scotsman.com/news/transport/tram-adds-york-place-stop-to-lure-extra-passengers-1-1988261 |title=Tram adds York Place stop to lure extra passengers |work=The Scotsman |date=29 November 2011 |accessdate=10 April 2012}}</ref> Construction has been ongoing since 2008, but has been met with many delays and contractual disputes.

==History==
Edinburgh's previous tram system, [[Edinburgh Corporation Tramways]], ran from 1871 until it was decommissioned on 16 November 1956.<ref name="tramhist">{{cite web |url=http://www.edinburgh-history.co.uk/edinburgh-trams.html |title=History of Trams in Edinburgh |accessdate=15 September 2013 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20120210083845/http://www.edinburgh-history.co.uk/edinburgh-trams.html |archivedate=10 February 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=07dnAAAAMAAJ |title=The Edinburgh Encyclopedia |publisher=Mainstream Publishing |last=Mullay |first=Sandy |year=1996 |pages=348-351 |isbn=1851587624}}</ref> Since then, public transport services consisted of [[buses]] and a limited network of [[commuter rail]] lines. Towards the end of the 20th century, there was [[Transport in the United Kingdom#Trams and Light Rail|revived interest]] in trams as a means of public transport, and several British cities such as [[Midland Metro|Birmingham]], [[Manchester Metrolink|Manchester]] and [[Nottingham Express Transit|Nottingham]] introduced new tram schemes.<ref name="scottramrev">{{cite news |url=http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/tram-system-set-for-scottish-revival-1303636 |title=Tram system set for Scottish revival |work=Daily Record |date=5 September 2012 |accessdate=17 September 2013}}</ref><ref name="tramcostbarrier">{{cite web |url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/trams-hit-cost-barrier-1342433.html |title=Trams hit cost barrier |work=The Independent |date=17 March 1996 |accessdate=17 September 2013}}</ref>

Various proposals for a new Edinburgh tram network were made in the 1990s, and a plan to build a line along [[Princes Street]] and [[Leith Walk]] to [[Newhaven, Edinburgh|Newhaven]] pier was unveiled in 1999 by the City of Edinburgh Council, [[Scottish Enterprise|Lothian and Edinburgh Enterprise]] and the New Edinburgh Tramways Company.<ref name="herald-1999">{{cite news |url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/sport/spl/aberdeen/capital-on-track-to-see-return-of-the-trams-1.288289 |title=Capital on track to see return of the trams |date=4 June 1999 |publisher=Glasgow Herald |accessdate=13 January 2010}}</ref><ref name="lrta-u-turn">{{cite web |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20110720111051/http://lrta.info/Facts/facts111.html |archivedate=20 July 2011 |title=Scottish Light Rail : is it a "U" Turn? |publisher=Light Rail Transit Association |url=http://lrta.info/Facts/facts111.html |accessdate=13 January 2010}}</ref>

===Proposals for a new Edinburgh tram network===
{{Main|Proposals for new tram lines in Edinburgh}}
The original 2001 proposal for Edinburgh Trams envisaged three routes across the city, lines 1, 2 and 3; the first being a circular route running around the northern suburbs, while the other two formed radial routes running out to [[Newbridge, Edinburgh|Newbridge]] in the west and to [[Newcraighall]] in the south respectively.<ref name="fact8">{{cite web |url=http://www.edinburghtrams.com/include/uploads/story_so_far/Tram_Factsheets_2.pdf |title=Tram Facts 8 |year=2006 |publisher=City of Edinburgh Council}}{{dead link|date=September 2013}}</ref> All lines would run through the city centre. In May 2004, a 15-year operating contract for Edinburgh Trams was awarded to [[Transdev]], who were to operate and maintain the tram network.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://archive.org/details/Nr110202Trams1 |title=Edinburgh trams Interim report |date=February 2011 |publisher=Auditor General for Scotland |accessdate=18 February 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.scotsman.com/news/french-firm-to-be-axed-in-major-edinburgh-tram-savings-drive-1-775287 |title='French firm to be axed' in major Edinburgh tram savings drive |work=The Scotsman |date=17 September 2009 |accessdate=18 September 2013}}</ref> This contract was later cancelled in 2009.<ref name="transdev-cancelled" />

Following these transport studies, two [[bill (proposed law)|bills]] were submitted to the [[Scottish Parliament]] to reintroduce a tram network to Edinburgh. Both bills were passed in March 2006, and received [[Royal Assent]] in April/May.<ref name="bill1">{{cite web |url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/asp/2006/7/contents |title=Edinburgh Tram (Line One) Act 2006 |date=29 March 2006 |publisher=legislation.gov.uk |accessdate=13 January 2010}}</ref><ref name="bill2">{{cite web |url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/asp/2006/6/contents |title=Edinburgh Tram (Line Two) Act 2006 |date=22 March 2006 |publisher=legislation.gov.uk |accessdate=13 January 2010}}</ref> Only lines 1 and 2 received parliamentary permission, and funding the construction of the entire network was deemed impossible. Line 3, which was meant to be paid for by a proposed Edinburgh [[congestion charge]], was scrapped when that scheme was [[Edinburgh congestion charge|heavily defeated in a referendum]]. For this reason the construction of the remaining two lines was split into four phases:
[[File:Edinburgh tramway map.svg|center|800px|A map of the planned tramway]]
<center>
'''Phase 1a''' would incorporate the construction of an {{convert|11.5|mi|adj=on|disp=flip}} line from [[Newhaven, Edinburgh|Newhaven]] to [[Edinburgh Airport]] via [[Princes Street]], combining parts of lines 1 and 2. <br>
'''Phase 1b''' would involve the construction of a {{convert|3.5|mi|adj=on|disp=flip}} line from [[Haymarket, Edinburgh|Haymarket]] to [[Granton, Edinburgh|Granton Square]] via [[Crewe Toll]],  comprising most of the remainder of line 1.<br>
'''Phase 2''' would link Granton Square and Newhaven together, completing the line 1 loop. <br>
'''Phase 3''' would have the airport line extended to [[Newbridge, Edinburgh|Newbridge]], completing line 2. <br>
</center>


Nevertheless, the future of the tram scheme came under threat in 2007, when the [[Scottish National Party]] (SNP) published its [[manifesto]] for the [[Scottish Parliament general election, 2007|Scottish Parliamentary election]]. In that document, the party made clear its intention to cancel the scheme, along with the [[Edinburgh Airport Rail Link]], in order to save a total of <U+00A3>1.1bn.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.politicsresources.net/area/uk/ass07/man/scot/snp.pdf |title=Manifesto of the Scottish National Party |publisher=Scottish National Party |format=PDF |accessdate=13 September 2013 |page=19}}</ref> In the debate on the government's transport programme, various opposition politicians made statements defending the Edinburgh Trams project. In particular, Labour MSP [[Wendy Alexander]] said ''"The Minister for Transport, Infrastructure and Climate Change claimed that the costs were out of control, but they are not."''<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/parliamentarybusiness/28862.aspx?r=4735&i=38754&c=899393&s= |title=Scottish Parliament Wednesday 27 June 2007 |publisher=The Scottish Parliament |accessdate=2 September 2011}}</ref> Following a vote which it lost in the [[Scottish Parliament]], the SNP-led minority [[Scottish Government]] agreed to continue with the line from the Airport to Leith on condition that no more public money would be supplied if the project overran. A report by [[Audit Scotland]], commissioned by the Scottish Government, confirmed that the cost projections were sound.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/edinburgh_and_east/6243158.stm |title=Climbdown after transport defeat |work=BBC News |date=27 June 2007 |accessdate=21 May 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.scotsman.com/news/politics/top-stories/trams-given-green-light-but-it-s-the-end-for-earl-and-delay-for-other-key-projects-1-906839 |title=Trams given green light |work=The Scotsman |date=28 June 2007 |accessdate=21 May 2010 |first=Hamish |last=Macdonell}}</ref> Initial costs for the scheme were estimated at <U+00A3>498 million, with <U+00A3>375 million in funding from the Scottish Government and <U+00A3>45 million from Edinburgh council.<ref name="docherty-shaw">{{cite book |first1=Iain |last1=Docherty |first2=Jon |last2=Shaw |url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=r_hUqVaw8qsC&pg=111#v=onepage&q&f=false |title=Traffic jam: ten years of 'sustainable' transport in the UK |publisher=The Policy Press |year=2008 |page=111 |isbn=1-84742-072-9}}</ref>

On 25 October 2007, the City of Edinburgh Council gave approval to the Final Business Case. Approval was given by the Council on 22 December 2007 for TIE to sign contracts with [[Construcciones y Auxiliar de Ferrocarriles|CAF]] for the supply of the vehicles and BBS (a consortium of [[Siemens]] and [[Bilfinger Berger]]) for the design, construction and building of the network.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.scotsman.com/news/scotland/top-stories/city-leaders-back-the-final-case-for-trams-1-1238818 |title=City leaders back the final case for trams |work=The Scotsman |date=22 December 2007 |accessdate=21 May 2010}}</ref> Contract negotiations were concluded in April 2008, with construction of the network commencing in June 2008.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.scotsman.com/news/city-chiefs-give-go-ahead-to-163-498m-tram-line-1-1345855 |title=City chiefs give go-ahead to <U+00A3>498m tram line |work=The Scotsman |date= 25 October 2007 |accessdate=21 May 2010}}</ref> Funding problems and political disputes led to scaling back of the original plans. In April 2009, [[Politics of Edinburgh|Edinburgh City Council]] announced the cancellation of Phase 1b of the project, citing problems caused by the [[Financial crisis of 2007<U+2013>2010|global recession]], saving an estimated <U+00A3>75 million.<ref name="1b-cancellation-bbc" /> This decision meant that the construction of the line to Granton would not go ahead for the foreseeable future.<ref name="telegraph-credit-crunch">{{cite news |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/scotland/3485321/Edinburgh-tram-network-falls-victim-to-credit-crunch.html |title=Edinburgh tram network falls victim to credit crunch |date=19 November 2008 |work=The Daily Telegraph |accessdate=11 January 2010 |first=Simon |last=Johnson}}</ref>

[[File:Princes Street, Edinburgh - geograph.org.uk - 1587765.jpg|thumb|Tracks being laid on [[Princes Street]] in November 2009]]

Until August 2011, the tram system construction project was overseen by [[Transport Initiatives Edinburgh]] (TIE), a company wholly owned by the [[City of Edinburgh Council]], who were responsible for [[project management|project-managing]] the construction of the tramway.<ref name="chaostram">{{cite web |url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/news/transport/after-eight-years-of-chaos-citys-pound700m-trams-project-is-stopped-in-its-tracks.14848264 |title=After eight years of chaos, city<U+2019>s <U+00A3>700m trams project is stopped in its tracks |work=The Herald |accessdate=15 September 2013 |first=Damien |last=Henderson}}</ref>

Construction commenced in spring 2007, with the draft business case having been accepted by the Scottish Government earlier that year.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/edinburgh_and_east/6458981.stm |title=<U+00A3>60m released for Edinburgh trams |work=BBC News |date=16 March 2007 |accessdate=21 May 2010}}</ref> Initial works centered around the movement of [[Public utility|underground utilities]] in preparation for track-laying. These works followed a plan by System Design Services (SDS), a joint design team led by [[Parsons Brinckerhoff]] and [[Halcrow Group Limited]]).

In May 2008, final contracts to build the tram system were awarded to BSC, a [[consortium]] of [[Bilfinger Berger]], [[Siemens]] and Spanish tram builder [[Construcciones y Auxiliar de Ferrocarriles]] (CAF).<ref>{{cite web |last=Rowson |first=Jessica |url=http://www.nce.co.uk/final-contracts-awarded-for-edinburgh-tram/1346152.article |title=Final contracts awarded for Edinburgh Tram |publisher=New Civil Engineer |date=16 May 2008 |accessdate=21 May 2010}}</ref>

The initial system uses a mix of [[street running]] and segregated off-road track, with conventional tram stop platforms.<ref name="traminfoed" /> Stops are fitted with shelters, ticket machines, lighting and [[CCTV]]. The network will be operated from a depot at [[Gogar]], close to the [[A8 road (Great Britain)|A8]] roundabout, just north of the [[Gyle Centre tram stop|Gyle tram stop]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.barr-construction.co.uk/projects%2Dand%2Dcase%2Dstudies/industrial%2Dbuilding/edinburgh%2Dtramway%2Ddepot/ | title=Edinburgh Tramway Depot | publisher=Barr Construction | date=2011 | accessdate=18 September 2013 | archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20120428185720/http://www.barr-construction.co.uk/projects%2Dand%2Dcase%2Dstudies/industrial%2Dbuilding/edinburgh%2Dtramway%2Ddepot/ | archivedate=28 April 2012}}</ref>

The route of the tram line required the construction of new bridges to cross railway lines at [[Edinburgh Park]] and [[Stenhouse, Edinburgh|Stenhouse]], and a tunnel under the A8 near the Gogar roundabout. Existing bridges at Balgreen, Roseburn, Coltbridge and Craigleith have also been widened, and the Murrayfield Viaduct was adapted for trams to pass under it.<ref name="railway-technology">{{cite web |url=http://www.railway-technology.com/projects/edinburghlightrail/ |title=Edinburgh Tramway, United Kingdom |publisher=railway-technology.com |accessdate=13 January 2010}}</ref> The works to build a tram interchange at Haymarket station involved the demolition of a [[Category A listed|Category C(S) listed building]], the former Caledonian Alehouse on Haymarket Terrace.<ref name="enviro-statement-line1">{{cite web |url=http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/S2_Bills/Edinburgh%20Tram%20(Line%20One)%20Bill/line1-NTS.pdf |title=Edinburgh Tram (Line One) Bill Environmental Statement |publisher=Scottish Parliament |accessdate=14 January 2010}}</ref> 

Some on-street sections of track had been laid into a special foundation with cobbled road surfacing designed to be sympathetic with the existing style of Edinburgh streets. This, however, was removed in many places due to objections from cyclists.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.edinburgh.gov.uk/download/meetings/id/35396/item_12-york_place_edinburgh. |title=Prior Approval 12/00915/PA at York Place - Edinburgh |publisher=City of Edinburgh Council |accessdate=17 September 2013}}</ref> The trams are powered by overhead cables, which are either attached to purposely-built poles or mounted to the sides of buildings.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.scotsman.com/news/opinion/letters/tram-wires-on-buildings-keep-the-clutter-down-1-3040023 |title=Tram wires on buildings keep the clutter down |work=The Scotsman |date=10 August 2013 |accessdate=17 September 2013}}</ref> There were to be nine electrical sub-stations for the line to Newhaven, both underground and above-ground.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/scotland/edinburgh_and_east/7364445.stm |title=Tram work to close Princes Street |work=BBC News |date=24 April 2008 |accessdate=17 September 2013}}</ref> The number of sub-stations was later reduced to five when the line was truncated to York Place.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.edinburghtrams.info/equipment |title=EDINBURGH TRAM INFO |publisher=Edinburgh Trams |date=Q4 2013 |accessdate=17 September 2013}}</ref>

====Project revisions and delays====
During the period between 2008 and 2009, the project was criticised for delays to work on tramway infrastructure, and in particular the closure of [[Princes Street]]. Transport Initiatives Edinburgh underwent some organisational change at this time; in November 2008, Willie Gallagher stepped down as executive chairman of the company.<ref name="journal-gallagher">{{cite news |url=http://www.journal-online.co.uk/article/5108-edinburgh-tram-boss-resigns |title=Edinburgh tram boss resigns |date=23 November 2008 |work=The Journal |accessdate=15 January 2010}}</ref> David Mackay, then Chairman of Transport Edinburgh Limited, took over as interim chairman<ref name="tie-mackay">{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/edinburgh_and_east/7735563.stm |title=Interim leader for capital trams |date=18 November 2008 |work=BBC News |accessdate=18 September 2013}}</ref> until he was replaced in May 2009 by Richard Jeffrey.<ref name="jeffrey-ceo">{{cite news |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-edinburgh-east-fife-13454021 |title=Richard Jeffrey quits as Edinburgh tram chief executive |date=19 May 2011 |work=BBC News |accessdate=18 September 2013}}</ref>

In April 2009, Phase 1b of the tram construction project was cancelled due to financial problems.<ref name="1b-cancellation-bbc">{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/edinburgh_and_east/8016093.stm |title=Funding concerns for tram project |date=24 April 2009 |work=BBC News |accessdate=11 January 2010}}</ref> Ongoing contractual disputes also delayed track-laying work in the city centre. In December 2009, there were media reports that the project budget was running over <U+00A3>545 million, and that the tram system was likely to come into operation at least seven months late, putting the launch date back to February 2012 or later.<ref name="herald-saga-09">{{cite news |url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/blogs/scotland-now/edinburgh-trams-saga-is-far-from-over-1.991682 |title=Edinburgh trams saga is far from over |last=Henderson |first=Damien |date=12 December 2009 |work=The Herald |accessdate=15 January 2010}}</ref> Reports in January 2010 suggested that certain important [[Milestone (project management)|milestones]] of the construction schedule had [[Project slippage|slipped]] by up to two years.<ref name="en-shambolic">{{cite news |url=http://www.scotsman.com/news/scotland/top-stories/shambolic-tram-project-is-up-to-two-years-behind-1-1228943 |title='Shambolic' tram project is up to two years behind |last=Marshall |first=Chris |date=25 January 2010 |work=The Scotsman |accessdate=25 January 2010}}</ref> In March 2010, Bilfinger Berger announced that the construction work would be delayed by a further 30 months, with an estimated completion date in 2014.<ref name="bbc-30-months">{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/edinburgh_and_east/8560788.stm |title=Tram project 'could be delayed' |date=10 March 2010 |work=BBC News |accessdate=11 March 2010}}</ref> This estimate was disputed by the Council, which claimed a completion date in 2012 was still feasible.<ref name="stv-2014">{{cite news |url=http://news.stv.tv/east-central/162746-trams-contractor-could-be-axed-over-further-30-month-delay/ |title=Trams firm faces axe as it reveals Edinburgh work may take until 2014 |date=10 March 2010 |publisher=STV |accessdate=11 March 2010}}</ref> The operating contract with Transdev was also cancelled in December 2009, in order to reduce costs; the trams are instead to be operated by Edinburgh Trams Limited,<ref name=companySC451434>{{cite web |url=http://data.companieshouse.gov.uk/doc/company/SC451434 |title=Companies House extract company no SC451434 Edinburgh Trams Limited |publisher=Companies House |accessdate=18 September 2013}}</ref> a company owned by the City of Edinburgh Council.<ref name="transdev-cancelled">{{cite news |url=http://www.transportxtra.com/magazines/new_transit/news/?id=18461 |title=Transdev loses Edinburgh tram contract as council seeks to scale down scheme<U+2019>s costs |date=21 December 2009 |publisher=Transport Xtra |accessdate=15 January 2010}}</ref>

====Contractual disputes====
In February 2009, work on the [[Princes Street]] section of the works was stopped due to contractual disagreements between TIE and the construction BSC consortium. BSC reportedly submitted a late request for an additional <U+00A3>80 million funding which TIE was unable to meet.<ref name="telegraph-bsc">{{cite news |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/scotland/4736023/512m-Edinburgh-tram-project-in-disarray.html |title=<U+00A3>512m Edinburgh tram project in disarray |date=20 February 2009 |work=The Daily Telegraph |accessdate=11 January 2010 |first=Auslan |last=Cramb}}</ref><ref name="stv-brakes">{{cite news |url=http://news.stv.tv/east-central/78176-business-dispute-slams-brakes-on-edinburgh-trams/ |title=Business dispute slams brakes on Edinburgh trams |work=STV News |date=21 February 2009 |accessdate=11 January 2010}}</ref> Dave Anderson, Edinburgh City Council<U+2019>s Director of City Development, expressed the view in an interview with the BBC's ''[[You and Yours]]'' radio programme, that the contractors' claims were unjustified as they had agreed to fixed-price contracts and to bear the project risks.<ref name="youandyours">{{cite episode

Delays in track laying and depot construction affected tram vehicle testing. By September 2009, the construction work was reported to be nine months behind schedule, and CAF was due to deliver the first newly-built tram vehicles from its factory in Spain.

====Funding crisis====

Following further disputes and delays to the project, it was reported in March 2010 that Edinburgh City Council were considering cancelling the contract with Bilfinger Berger.<ref name="stv-2014" /> By June 2010, the cost of the project had risen to <U+00A3>600 million or more.<ref name="herald-no-idea">{{cite news |last=Leask |first=David |title=Tram chiefs admit: we have no idea what final bill will be |url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/news/transport-environment/tram-chiefs-admit-we-have-no-idea-what-final-bill-will-be-1.1035908 |accessdate=19 June 2010 |work=The Herald |date=19 June 2010}}</ref> City Council project managers were reported to be in crisis talks, considering a number of options including: borrowing an extra <U+00A3>55 million to fund the increased costs; phasing the introduction of the tram line, so that trams would initially run only between the airport and Haymarket; and terminating the contract with Bilfinger Berger.<ref name="guardian-18-june-2010">{{cite news |last=Carrell |first=Severin |title=Edinburgh trams project in crisis as sacking of key contractor is considered |url=http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2010/jun/18/edinburgh-trams-project-in-crisis |accessdate=19 June 2010 |work=The Guardian |date=18 June 2010}}</ref> The Council asked TIE to draw up detailed costs for truncating the tram line at four possible termini: [[Haymarket railway station|Haymarket station]], York Place, the foot of [[Leith Walk]] or [[Ocean Terminal, Edinburgh|Ocean Terminal]].<ref name="scotsman-cut-short">{{cite news |last=Ferguson |first=Brian |title=Soaring costs may force Edinburgh tram line to be cut short |url=http://www.scotsman.com/news/soaring-costs-may-force-edinburgh-tram-line-to-be-cut-short-1-813537 |accessdate=19 June 2010 |work=The Scotsman |date=19 June 2010}}</ref>

In May 2011, it was announced that contractors would return to work at priority locations (Haymarket Yards, Gogar roundabout and the depot) while the future of the project was decided. In addition, a 10-month programme of remedial work on Princes Street tracks that had been laid earlier was announced, due to crumbling tarmac.<ref name=scotsman-20110513 /> The same month, Richard Jeffrey resigned as Chief Executive of TIE after two years in the job.<ref name="jeffrey-ceo"/> Shortly after Jeffrey's resignation, four [[non-executive director]]s<ref name=scotsman-neds>{{cite news |last=Marshall |first=Chris  |title=TIE bosses 'quit en masse' as trams shake-up looms|url=http://www.scotsman.com/news/tie-bosses-quit-en-masse-as-trams-shake-up-looms-1-1668408 |accessdate=11 June 2011 |work=The Scotsman |date=31 May 2011}}</ref>  and the communications director<ref name=bbc-haeburn>{{cite news |title=Mandy Haeburn-Little to leave Edinburgh Trams project |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-edinburgh-east-fife-13681271 |work=BBC News |accessdate=11 June 2011 |date=7 June 2011}}</ref> of TIE also resigned.

On 30 June 2011, the City of Edinburgh Council voted to continue with the project (albeit only between Edinburgh Airport and St Andrew Square), with costs having risen to an estimated <U+00A3>770m, leaving the Council with a shortfall of more than <U+00A3>200m.<ref name=u-turn /><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.scotsman.com/news/exclusive-trams-set-to-stop-at-york-place-1-1245146 |title=Exclusive: Trams set to stop at York Place |work=The Scotsman |date=23 June 2010 |accessdate=17 September 2013}}</ref> The option of scrapping the project was considered, but rejected.<ref name=bbc-vote>{{cite news |title=Edinburgh trams: Councillors vote to continue project |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-edinburgh-east-fife-13959276 |work=BBC News |date=30 June 2011 |accessdate=30 June 2011}}</ref> On 25 August 2011, the Council voted to cut the line further to run only between the airport and [[Haymarket, Edinburgh|Haymarket]], reducing the expected cost to <U+00A3>715m.<ref name=herald-haymarket>{{cite web |title=Running trams to Princes Street <U+00A3>60m cheaper |url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/news/transport-environment/running-trams-to-princes-street-60m-cheaper-1.1120202 |work=The Herald |date=27 August 2011 |accessdate=27 August 2011}}</ref> A week later, after the Scottish Government threatened to withhold <U+00A3>72 million of funding,<ref name=bbc-withhold>{{cite news |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-edinburgh-east-fife-14713476 |title=Ministers withhold Edinburgh trams funding |work=BBC News |date=30 August 2011 |accessdate=20 March 2012}}</ref> they reversed this decision, restoring the terminus at [[St Andrew Square, Edinburgh|St Andrew Square]].<ref name=u-turn>{{cite news |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-edinburgh-east-fife-14751711 |title=Edinburgh trams: Council backs St Andrew Square option |work=BBC News |date=2 September 2011 |accessdate=2 September 2011}}</ref> On 29 November 2011 it was announced that the eastern terminus of the tram line would be at York Place instead of St Andrew Square; the intention had been to build the tracks to a reversing point at York Place (but without a stop for passengers).

The first electric wires were energised in October 2011, above newly laid track within the depot at Gogar. Testing of trams began in December 2011 on the first part of the line to be completed (adjacent to the depot at Gogar, approximately {{convert|500|m}} in length).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-edinburgh-east-fife-15337328 |title=First tram arrives at Gogar depot in Edinburgh |work=BBC News |date=17 October 2011 |accessdate=17 September 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-edinburgh-east-fife-16147559 |accessdate=18 September 2013 |work=BBC News |title=Edinburgh trams on track for test trials at Gogar |date=12 December 2011}}</ref> On 15 December 2011 the depot was officially handed over from the contractors to the City of Edinburgh Council.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.edinburgh.gov.uk/news/article/744/depot_handover_marks_major_milestone_for_edinburgh_trams |title=Depot handover marks major milestone for Edinburgh Trams |publisher=City of Edinburgh Council |date=15 December 2011 |accessdate=17 September 2013 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20130202090537/http://www.edinburgh.gov.uk/news/article/744/depot_handover_marks_major_milestone_for_edinburgh_trams |archivedate=2 February 2013}}</ref>

The first section of the line to be completed was between the depot and Edinburgh Airport, in late 2012. Using this section of line, on 19 December 2012 the first test operation of a tram operating at full speed was made.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.edinburgh.gov.uk/news/article/1103/full_speed_tram_tests_mark_the_end_of_successful_2012 |title=Full speed tram tests mark the end of successful 2012 |publisher=City of Edinburgh Council |date=19 December 2012 |accessdate=17 September 2013 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20130202171320/http://www.edinburgh.gov.uk/news/article/1103/full_speed_tram_tests_mark_the_end_of_successful_2012 |archivedate=2 February 2013}}</ref>

====Criticism of the works====
Ongoing delays in the tram works were criticised by local businesses, who claimed that their income had been adversely affected by long-term road closures in the centre of Edinburgh since 2008,<ref name="bbc-traders">{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/edinburgh_and_east/7373659.stm |title=Traders create tram action group |date=29 April 2008 |work=BBC News |accessdate=11 January 2010}}</ref><ref name="en-shandwick">{{cite news |url=http://www.scotsman.com/news/scotland/top-stories/traders-unhappy-as-shandwick-place-to-close-for-18-months-1-1226555 |title=Traders unhappy as Shandwick Place to close for 18 months |date=22 December 2009 |work=The Scotsman |accessdate=16 January 2010}}</ref> and by Edinburgh residents who have voiced dismay over the delays.<ref name="youandyours" /> Construction project delays have also been criticised for causing an obstruction across the city during the 2009 [[Edinburgh International Festival|Edinburgh Festival]] and [[Edinburgh Festival Fringe|Fringe]].<ref name="times_0709">{{cite news |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/scotland/article6729696.ece |title=Tram works turn Edinburgh into 'war zone' |last=McIntosh |first=Lindsay |date=27 July 2009 |work=The Times |accessdate=13 January 2010}}{{subscription required}}</ref> Construction was halted once again in January 2010 due to freezing temperatures.<ref name="en-freeze">{{cite news |url=http://www.scotsman.com/news/scotland/top-stories/big-freeze-puts-tram-works-on-hold-1-1227728 |title=Big freeze puts tram works on hold |date=9 January 2010 |work=The Scotsman |accessdate=16 January 2010}}</ref>

Cycling groups in the city have voiced safety concerns after some cyclists suffered accidents when their bicycle wheels became caught in tracks. They also reported that the road surface around the tracks was crumbling, raising further safety problems. In response, TIE carried out road repairs and Edinburgh Trams agreed to fund special training for local cyclists.<ref name="bbc-cycles">{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/edinburgh_and_east/8400094.stm |title=Edinburgh tram lines throw cyclists off track |date=7 December 2009 |work=BBC News |accessdate=11 January 2010}}</ref> Further safety concerns have been raised by residents along the tram routes about the suspension of overhead electric cables from residential buildings, with some property owners refusing to give permission for the cables to be attached.<ref name="shocker" />

On September 2011, Princes Street was closed again to all traffic for around 10 months to allow repairs on the crumbling tarmac around the unused tram lines.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.scotsman.com/news/tram_repair_crews_out_to_fix_botched_roadworks_1_1531045 |title=Tram repair crews out to fix 'botched' roadworks <U+2013> News |work=The Scotsman |date=9 March 2011 |accessdate=20 November 2011}}</ref><ref name="bbc-princes-reclosure">{{cite news |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-edinburgh-east-fife-14958817 |title=Edinburgh tram line repair works get under way |date=17 September 2011 |work=BBC News |accessdate=18 November 2011}}</ref> City centre residents filed a complaint with the [[UNECE]] [[Aarhus Convention Compliance Committee]] in December 2011, arguing that traffic diversions through residential streets during the protracted construction of the tramline has resulted in increased pollution and noise, to the detriment of residents' health.

===2013 to present===
[[File:Edinburgh tramline construction, 2012.JPG|thumb|Ongoing tramline construction at St Andrew Street in September 2012]]
Work since late 2012 continued mostly on schedule, and there was even talk of opening the tram system by Christmas 2013, earlier than the original summer 2014 deadline.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.scotsman.com/news/transport/edinburgh-trams-line-may-be-open-for-christmas-1-2986949 |title=Line may be open for Christmas |work=The Scotsman |date=3 July 2013 |accessdate=17 September 2013}}</ref> However, it was revealed on 31 May 2013 that more than {{convert|150|m}} yards of concrete trackbed would have to be replaced between Shandwick Place and Haymarket, because the concrete was not laid to the correct specifications. Edinburgh Council has insisted that this will not affect the original deadline.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.scotsman.com/news/transport/edinburgh-trams-section-of-track-to-be-ripped-up-1-2950473 |title=Section of track to be ripped up |work=The Scotsman |date=31 May 2013 |accessdate=17 September 2013}}</ref>

Contractors later admitted their error with regard to the concrete, and remedial works began. This has led to further disruption of Shandwick Place and Haymarket, which originally to be free of track works by September 2013.<ref name="concreteblunder">{{cite web |url=http://www.scotsman.com/news/transport/edinburgh-trams-contractors-admit-concrete-blunder-1-3038204 |title=Contractors admit concrete blunder |work=The Scotsman |date=9 August 2013 |accessdate=17 September 2013}}</ref> Michael Apter, chairman of the West End Association, stated that "There was a lot of optimism at Easter [2013] and the back of Easter about trams running as early as autumn. It was only with the discovery of these errors that has kicked that back". He added that the date for completion of the trams hung in the balance. Edinburgh Council has not yet released a revised timeline, but still insists that the remedial works while "taking longer than initially estimated", would "not impact upon the overall timeframe".<ref name="concreteblunder" /> In June 2013, overhead electric wires were installed on the city centre portion of the route. This has been considered the "last major step" in the construction process.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.railstaff.co.uk/2013/06/21/edinburgh-wires-go-up/ |title=Edinburgh wires go up |publisher=RailStaff |date=21 June 2013 |accessdate=17 September 2013}}</ref>

Continuing criticism has been launched at the tram project, even as it has neared completion. The ''[[Edinburgh Evening News]]'' reported in August 2013 that the tram would take eight minutes longer to travel between the airport and city centre than the existing bus service. [[Marco Biagi (politician)|Marco Biagi]], a [[Member of the Scottish Parliament]] for [[Edinburgh Central (Scottish Parliament constituency)|Edinburgh Central]], issued a statement saying "People used to think the tram line was just an overpriced upgrade for the airport bus. Now we all know it<U+2019>s just an overpriced downgrade".<ref name="longerthanbus">{{cite web |url=http://www.edinburghnews.scotsman.com/news/transport/edinburgh-tram-will-take-longer-than-bus-to-airport-1-3050903 |title=Edinburgh tram will take longer than bus to airport |work=Edinburgh Evening News |date=17 August 2013 |accessdate=17 September 2013}}</ref>

Particular controversy erupted over concessionary travel for the elderly and disabled. Originally, it was planned that concessionary travel, that is the ability of those with a [[Scottish National Entitlement Card]] to travel on public transport free-of-charge, was not going to be offered on the tram system. This was despite the fact that Edinburgh Trams is to be run by Lothian Buses, who are mandated to offer free travel to those with concession cards on all their bus routes.<ref name="autogenerated1">{{cite web |url=http://www.scotsman.com/news/transport/call-to-give-elderly-free-travel-on-city-trams-1-2735967 |title=Call to give elderly free travel on city trams |work=The Scotsman |date=14 January 2013 |accessdate=17 September 2013}}</ref> This revelation quickly caused city leaders to support an ''Edinburgh Evening News'' campaign to ensure that concessionary travel would be offered on the new tram system. City transport convener [[Lesley Hinds]] stated "People in Edinburgh have paid through their council tax and their taxes for the trams to get up and running and it would be wrong for a large proportion of the population not to be allowed to use their concessionary bus pass".<ref name=autogenerated1 />

Despite this, the [[Scottish Government]] refused to pay for concessionary travel for the tram scheme, as it does for all bus routes in Scotland. Talks between the Scottish Government and Edinburgh Council eventually decided that concession cards should be valid for tram travel, but that they should be paid for by the Council instead of the Government.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.scotsman.com/news/transport/free-tram-travel-for-the-elderly-1-2780521 |title=Free tram travel for the elderly |work=The Scotsman |date=8 February 2013 |accessdate=17 September 2013}}</ref> It was revealed on 15 August 2013 that the cards would be valid, and that travel would be paid for by Edinburgh Council. However, only people with cards issued in Edinburgh would be able to use them.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://news.stv.tv/east-central/236181-passengers-to-use-one-ticket-for-both-edinburgh-trams-and-buses/ |title=Passengers to use one ticket for both Edinburgh trams and buses |work=STV News |date=15 August 2013 |accessdate=17 September 2013}}</ref> This compromise upset many people in [[the Lothians]], who often commute or travel into Edinburgh.<ref name="TicketingSCOTSMANAug13" />
On 12 August 2013, it was reported that the future drivers of the trams were beginning to be trained on the completed section of track between Edinburgh Airport and the Gogar depot.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/edinburghs-delayed-776m-trams-finally-2153240 |title=Edinburgh's delayed <U+00A3>776m trams finally on the move... but only go 500m |work=Daily Record |date=12 August 2013 |accessdate=17 September 2013 |last=Sharp |first=Marie}}</ref> On 15 August 2013, Edinburgh Council announced the creation of [[Transport for Edinburgh]], a new public body to oversee public transport in Edinburgh, including both buses and trams. Lesley Hinds stated: "Our first priority will be integration between bus and tram services and we will have the executive directors of Lothian Buses on the board of the new organisation".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-edinburgh-east-fife-23716810 |title=Transport for Edinburgh: New body to oversee trams and buses |work=BBC News |date=15 August 2013 |accessdate=17 September 2013}}</ref>

Edinburgh Council announced on 17 September 2013 that works on the tram scheme were running two months ahead of schedule, and also that the system would be open by May 2014.<ref name=autogenerated3 /> All tram and road works are due to be completed by 19 October.

===Livery===
To create a visual continuity between the tram fleets and local bus services, Edinburgh trams will have the same livery as that of Lothian Buses. The prototype CAF trams were originally decorated with the "harlequin" design that was introduced on Lothian Buses in the 1990s. Following the announcement of a rebranding of the bus fleet in April 2010, Lothian Buses are reintroducing their traditional [[Rose madder|madder]] and white [[livery]], and the Edinburgh tram fleet will now be painted in a matching colour scheme.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.scotsman.com/news/lowdown-on-new-look-for-lothian-buses-600-strong-fleet-1-798089  |work=The Scotsman |first=Alastair |last=Dalton |title=Lowdown on new look for Lothian Buses' 600 strong fleet |date=31 March 2010 |accessdate=18 September 2013}}</ref>

==Operations, fares and ticketing==
===Route===
The {{convert|14|km|mi|adj=on}} route begins running on-street at York Place, in the city centre.<ref name="bus-station-facts"/><ref name="trammap">{{cite web |url=http://www.onlyinedinburgh.com/the-city/transport/trams/ |title=Edinburgh Trams |publisher=Only in Edinburgh |accessdate=16 September 2013 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20130904040237/http://www.onlyinedinburgh.com/the-city/transport/trams/ |archivedate=4 September 2013}}</ref> It then turns into North St Andrew Street, where it proceeds into [[St Andrew Square, Edinburgh|St Andrew Square]]. From the square, the line heads southeast into [[Princes Street]], and then west along that street toward [[Haymarket, Edinburgh|Haymarket]], via Shandwick Place, Atholl Place, and West Maitland Street.<ref name="Openstreetmap">{{cite web |url=http://www.openstreetmap.org/browse/relation/2632877 | title=Edinburgh Trams Map |publisher=OpenStreetMap |accessdate=16 September 2013}}</ref> At Haymarket, the route heads off-street onto a segregated track that runs parallel to the [[Glasgow to Edinburgh via Falkirk Line|Glasgow to Edinburgh mainline]]. It follows the railway line west for about {{convert|4.2|mi|km|disp=flip}}, until it reaches [[Edinburgh Park railway station]]. At that station, it leaves the railway line on a segregated track and heads north to Gogar Roundabout. From the roundabout, the route heads northwest via [[Ingliston]] Park and Ride to [[Edinburgh Airport]], where the line terminates.<ref name="Openstreetmap" />

===Fare structure===
Ticketing and fares will be fully integrated with [[Lothian Buses]]. The fare for a single journey on the tram network will be the same as on Lothian Buses, and day tickets and Ridacards will be valid on both the trams and buses.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.scotsman.com/news/transport-chief-prices-single-tram-ticket-at-163-1-25-1-1334966 |title=Transport chief prices single tram ticket at <U+00A3>1.25 |work=The Scotsman |date=17 January 2007 |accessdate=21 May 2010}}</ref> Ticket prices are expected to be the same as [[Lothian Buses]] (<U+00A3>1.50 for an adult single as at September 2013)<ref>{{cite web |url=http://lothianbuses.com/timetables-tickets-maps/fares-and-tickets |title=Fares and tickets |publisher=Lothian Buses |accessdate=18 September 2013}}</ref> when the network opens, with journeys between Edinburgh Airport and the Gogar Depot attracting a supplement, which has yet to be determined.<ref name="TicketingSCOTSMANAug13">{{cite web |url=http://www.scotsman.com/news/transport/anger-at-edinburgh-trams-ticket-plans-1-3048079 |title=Anger at Edinburgh trams ticket plans |work=The Scotsman |accessdate=26 Aug 2013}}</ref>

Free travel will be available to Scottish National Entitlement Cards that have been issued in Edinburgh. Passengers living outside Edinburgh will be expected to pay full fare on the Edinburgh Trams.<ref name="TicketingSCOTSMANAug13" />

===Ticket machines===
[[File:Edinburgh tram 02.jpg|thumb|The first completed Edinburgh tram displayed on [[Princes Street]] in 2010]]
At the request of Lothian Buses, installation of 30 ticket machines at key bus stops began in 2007. These allowed passengers to purchase tickets before boarding their bus reducing dwell times and giving more time to select the right ticket for their journey.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/edinburgh_and_east/6034937.stm |work=BBC News |title=On-street bus ticket machine plan |date=9 October 2006}}</ref> The ticket machines were to have been modified to issue tram tickets once the service began. Due to lack of popularity with users the machines were scrapped in 2011. It is still planned to install similar on-street ticket machines at tram stops before the tram service opens.<ref name="en-tickets">{{cite web |url=http://www.scotsman.com/news/lost-track-ticket-machines-for-trams-to-be-reinstalled-1-1572553 |title=Lost track? Ticket machines for trams to be reinstalled |date=5 April 2011 |first=Chris |last=Marshall |work=The Scotsman |accessdate=21 April 2011}}</ref>

===Staffing===
Fifty-two [[Manual fare collection|ticket inspectors]] have been hired to guard against [[fare dodging]]. This amounts to three inspectors per tram, as there are seventeen trams being prepared for service.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.scotsman.com/news/transport/edinburgh-trams-ticket-inspectors-excessive-1-3050905 |title=Ticket inspectors <U+2018>excessive<U+2019> |work=The Scotsman |date=17 August 2013 |accessdate=17 September 2013}}</ref> Edinburgh Council has said that they are aiming for three-percent fare evasion rate, lower than any other tramway in Britain. Nevertheless, the level of staffing has been criticised by various bodies as being "excessive".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.scotsman.com/news/transport/edinburgh-tram-inspectors-to-police-bad-behaviour-1-3009333 |title=Edinburgh Tram inspectors to police bad behaviour |work=The Scotsman |date=22 July 2013 |accessdate=17 September 2013}}</ref>

Thirty-two tram drivers have been hired and trained by [[Lothian Buses]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/edinburgh-tram-drivers-sit-personality-2029979 |title=Edinburgh tram drivers must pass bizarre personality test to make sure they don't scare off passengers |work=Daily Record |date=6 July 2013 |accessdate=17 September 2013}}</ref>

===Journey times and frequency===
The tram is proposed to operate every seven-and-a-half minutes, with a journey time of approximately 33 minutes from the city centre to the airport.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.scotsman.com/news/edinburgh-trams-infrequent-timetable-fears-1-2944543 |title=Infrequent timetable fears |work=The Scotsman |date=25 May 2013 |accessdate=17 September 2013}}</ref> The service is expected to run from 06:00 until midnight on Monday through Saturday. On Sunday, it is proposed that service will run from 07:00 until midnight.<ref name="tram-facts"/>
