'''John Howard "Johnny" Chester''' (born 26 December 1941) is an Australian singer-songwriter, who started his career in October 1959 singing [[rock'n'roll]] and in 1969 changed to [[country music]]. He has toured nationally with [[The Beatles]], [[Roy Orbison]], [[The Everly Brothers]], [[Kenny Rogers]], [[Johnny Cash]], [[Tammy Wynette]] and [[Charley Pride]]. During his career he has led various groups including Johnny Chester and The Chessmen, Johnny Chester and Jigsaw, Johnny Chester and Hotspur. With Jigsaw he had five top&nbsp;30 hit singles, "Gwen (Congratulations)" (1971), "Shame and Scandal", "Midnight Bus" (both 1972), "World's Greatest Mum" (No.&nbsp;9, 1973) and "She's My Kind of Woman" (1974).

Chester has hosted various TV series: ''Teen Time on Ten'' (Channel 10,  Gippsland), ''Teen Scene'' ([[ABC Television|ABC TV]]) and ''Country Road'' (ABC TV). He has worked as a radio announcer on Melbourne radio station 3UZ and [[Radio Australia]]. He wrote a musical comedy, ''Rebound'', that opened in [[Wagga Wagga]]. Chester has won Golden Guitars at the [[Country Music Awards of Australia]] for best selling track in 1975 and for Male Vocalist of the Year in 1981, 1982 and 1983. In 1994 he was awarded the Songmaker of the Year Award from the Tamworth Songwriters Association. According to Australian rock music historian, [[Ian McFarlane]], he is "one of Melbourne's first and best rock'n'roll singers of the early 1960s". Music journalist, [[Ed Nimmervoll]], acknowledges Chester's "essential inclusion on any major national rock package coming into Melbourne" and later he "helped bring Australian country music to pop respectability".

==Biography==
John Howard Chester was born on 26 December 1941 and grew up in Melbourne's suburb of [[Preston, Victoria|Preston]].<ref name="McFarlane"/><ref name="APRA World"/><ref name="amg-bio"/> His father, Jack, was a mechanic with his garage in [[Carlton, Victoria|Carlton]], and his mother was Norma.<ref name="Johnston"/> He has a younger sister, Margaret (born ca. 1951).<ref name="NLA2"/> Chester attended Bell Primary and followed with [[Northern Melbourne Institute of TAFE#Preston Technical School|Preston Technical School]].<ref name="Johnston"/> At the age of 14-years-old he left school and worked as a brake specialist for his father.<ref name="NLA1"/> He had learned to play the drums, from the age of six,<ref name="NLA4"/> and guitar.<ref name="McFarlane"/><ref name="NLA1"/> In October 1959 Chester formed a band, The Jaywoods, and organised dances at a West Preston church hall, "I could play the guitar ... but I was pretty useless at it. So I started singing <U+2013> and the kids seemed to like my voice ... We used to get about 200 kids to these dances ... We had an old amplifier that distorted everything, but we thought we were mighty".<ref name="Johnston"/><ref name="NLA1"/> His idols were Buddy Holly, Elvis Presley, Eddie Cochran, Gene Vincent and Johnny O'Keefe.<ref name="McFarlane"/> Music journalist, [[Ed Nimmervoll]], noted "without really trying the Jaywoods' rehearsals were attracting a crowd to St. Cecilia's Hall in West Preston, which turned into regular Saturday night dance".<ref name="Nimmervoll"/> By 1960 The Jaywoods became Johnny Chester and The Chessmen with Chester on lead vocals, Jeff Cason on [[Double bass|upright slap bass guitar]], Huey Fryer on lead guitar, Bert Stacpool on piano, Les Stacpool on saxophone, and Len Woodhouse on drums.<ref name="McFarlaneC"/> The following year the line-up were Bert Stacpool, Les Stacpool (now on guitar), Frank McMahon on bass guitar and Graeme Trottman on drums.<ref name="McFarlaneC"/>

Chester was also backed by The Thunderbirds, which were an instrumental group formed in 1957 and, by the end of 1960, consisted of Henri Bource on saxophone and flute, Harold Frith on drums, Charles Gauld on guitar, Gordon Onley on bass guitar and Murray Robertson on piano.<ref name="McFarlaneT"/> Both backing bands maintained independent careers, released their own material and backed other artists.<ref name="McFarlaneC"/><ref name="McFarlaneT"/> In April 1961 Chester's first stadium performance was supporting [[Connie Francis]] and [[Johnny Burnette]].<ref name="NLA1"/> One of his early fans was radio DJ, [[Stan Rofe]], who promoted the artist on the [[Gold 104.3|3KZ]] program, ''Platter Parade''.<ref name="McFarlane"/> Rofe was highly supportive and introduced Chester to W&G Record's Ron Tudor.<ref name="McFarlane"/><ref name="Nimmervoll"/> Chester signed with the label and issued his debut single, "Hokey Pokey", in May 1961 with backing by The Thunderbirds.<ref name="McFarlane"/><ref name="McFarlaneT"/> The track became a top&nbsp;10 hit in Melbourne.<ref name="McFarlane"/> His second single, "Can Can Ladies", appeared in July and reached the local top&nbsp;5 in July.<ref name="McFarlane"/> In January 1962 a third single backed by The Thunderbirds, "Shakin' All Over", reached No.&nbsp;4.<ref name="McFarlane"/> Johnny Chester and The Chessmen toured to Brisbane and Hobart but had less popularity in Sydney.<ref name="Nimmervoll"/>

From 1962 to 1964 his next eight singles for W&G were all recorded with backing by The Chessmen.<ref name="McFarlane"/> Of these, the highest charting was a cover version of Cochran's "[[Summertime Blues]]", which appeared at No.&nbsp;6 in December 1962.<ref name="McFarlane"/> He had also issued his debut album, ''Wild and Warm'' in 1963 and two extended plays, ''Johnny Chester's Hit Parade'' and ''My Blues and I'', with W&G.<ref name="McFarlane"/> In February that year he started hosting his own TV show, ''Teen Time on Ten'', on a regional [[Gippsland]] channel.<ref name="Baker"/> ''[[Australian Women's Weekly]]''{{'}}s Ainslie Baker declared he had "proved himself an easy, friendly talker" and predicted this could lead to his "having Melbourne's first teenage TV show".<ref name="Baker"/> In July 1964 Chester supported the Australian tour by [[The Beatles]] with his backing by The Phantoms.<ref name="McFarlane"/><ref name="McFarlaneP"/> According to Chester "my only worry is that I mightn't live up to this honour and obligation to give the kids a good performance".<ref name="NLA2"/> He was disappointed that The Chessmen were unavailable for the 19-gigs, through state capitals and to New Zealand, "As all the boys have day jobs ... they would not be able to get the time off".<ref name="NLA2"/> The Phantoms were another instrumental group, which had formed in 1960, and by 1964 had the line-up of Alan Fenton on drums, Bob Garde on rhythm guitar, Dave Lincoln on lead guitar, and Pete Watson on bass guitar.<ref name="McFarlaneP"/> From October for two seasons, Chester was the host of [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]] (ABC-TV) program, ''Teen Scene'', with The Chessmen as the resident band.<ref name="McFarlane"/><ref name="McFarlaneC"/>

Fenton died in a car accident and was replaced on drums by Eddie Chapel, at about that time Eames was replaced by Jon Calderwood.<ref name="McFarlaneJ"/> In August 1970 Jigsaw, without Chester, had a number-one hit with a cover version of United Kingdom group, Christie's "[[Yellow River (song)|Yellow River]]", it was co-credited with Sydney-based band Autumn which also covered the track.<ref name="McFarlaneJ"/><ref name="Kent"/> With Chester, they had five national top&nbsp;30 singles: "Gwen (Congratulations)" (No.&nbsp;26, October 1971), "Shame and Scandal" (No.&nbsp;12, February 1972), "Midnight Bus" (No.&nbsp;25, December), "World's Greatest Mum" (No.&nbsp;9, August 1973) and "She's My Kind of Woman" (No.&nbsp;17, June 1974).<ref name="Kent"/>
