'''Fyodor Davydovich Kulakov''' ({{lang-ru|<U+0424><U+0451><U+0434><U+043E><U+0440> <U+0414><U+0430><U+0432><U+044B><U+0434><U+043E><U+0432><U+0438><U+0447> <U+041A><U+0443><U+043B><U+0430><U+043A><U+043E><U+0432>}}) (4 February 1918 in [[Lgovskiy]], [[Penza Oblast]], [[Russian Empire]] <U+2013> 17 July 1978 in [[Moscow|Moscow]], [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|Russian SFSR]]) was a [[Soviet people|Soviet]]-[[Russian people|Russian]] statesman during the [[Cold War]]. Kulakov served as [[Stavropol Krai|Stavropol]] First Secretary from 1960 until 1964, right after [[Nikita Khrushchev]]'s ouster. During his First Secretaryship in Stravopol Kulakov met [[Mikhail Gorbachev]]; Kulakov would go on to become Gorbachev's mentor, and when he left his Stravopol First Secretaryship to ensue national politics, Gorbachev took over his old office. Kulakov was elected to several important seats in the 1960s, and in 1971 he was elected to the [[Politburo of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Political Bureau]] (Politburo). He would go on to become a leading figure of the Soviet leadership, and was able to impress Soviet leader [[Leonid Brezhnev]] to such an extent that commentators thought that Kulakov would become Brezhnev's heir. This, however did not materialise as Kulakov died in 1978, four years before Brezhnev.

==Career==
Kulakov was born in 1918 to a [[peasant]] family in [[Penza Oblast]].{{sfn|Law|1975|p=230}} Just as his parents Kulakov studied, and later, graduated as an [[agronomist]].{{sfn|Law|1975|pp=230<U+2013>1}} In 1938 Kulakov started working in a sugar combine, and attended an Agricultural Institute which he graduated from in 1941. In 1940 he became a member of the [[All-Union Communist Party (bolsheviks)]] and became a leading figure at his local [[Komsomol]] regional committee. Kalukov was later appointed to the position of Chairman of the Executive Committee of the Regional Party Committee of the Penza Oblast.{{sfn|Law|1975|p=231}} In Penza Kulakov became a close-knit companion of [[Konstantin Chernenko]], a future [[Soviet leader]].{{sfn|Hough|1997|p=67}} He advanced through the Soviet hierarchy quickly and in 1955 he became Deputy Minister of Agriculture of the [[Russian SFSR]], he was later promoted to Minister of Grain Products of the Russian SFSR. In 1960 he was appointed to First Secretary of the [[Stavropol Krai|Stavropol]] [[Regional Party Committee]].{{sfn|Law|1975|p=231}} During his tenure as Stavropol First Secretary he appointed [[Mikhail Gorbachev]], a promotion which would prove to be crucial, to the provincial level of the party apparatus.<ref>{{Cite book | author = [[Seweryn Bialer|Bialer, Seweryn]] | title = The Soviet paradox: external expansion, internal decline | location = | publisher = [[I.B.

In 1964 Kulakov was brought to [[Moscow]] to become the Head of the Agricultural Department of the [[Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Central Committee]] (CC). Eleven months later Kulakov was appointed to Central Committee Secretary of Agriculture.{{sfn|Hough|1997|p=67}} Kulakov became elected to the Central Committee in 1964, and later, to a seat in the [[Secretariat of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Secretariat]] in September 1965.<ref name="CC"/> Gorbachev would usually ask Kulakov's, his closeness to Kulakov helped Gorbachev to establish friendly relations with [[KGB]] chairman [[Yuri Andropov]].{{sfn|Hough|1997|p=68}} At the [[24th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|24th Party Congress]] Kulakov became a [[Politburo of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Political Bureau]] (Politburo) member without serving a term as candidate member of the Politburo. It is believed that Kulakov was able to greatly impress [[Leonid Brezhnev]] due to his achievements in [[Agriculture of the Soviet Union|agriculture]] and politics. The three other young Politburo members, [[Volodymyr Shcherbytsky]], [[Alexander Shelepin]] and [[Dmitry Polyansky]], were all believed to have a future in the [[Council of Ministers (Soviet Union)|Council of Ministers]], while [[First World]] commentators speculated that Kulakov's future was more inline with political and executive work at the top-level of leadership. Kulakov was one of four who had both a seat in the Secretariat and Politburo, the three others were Brezhnev, Kirilenko and Suslov.{{sfn|Law|1975|p=231}} In his later years Kulakov had become one of Kirilenko's "counterweight's" in the Central Committee.{{sfn|Hough|1997|p=85}}

While Brezhnev never had a clear heir apparent Kulakov was seen as a likely successor due to his age. His most notable competitors, [[Andrei Kirilenko (politician)|Andrei Kirilenko]] and [[Mikhail Suslov]], were older than Brezhnev and therefor seen as unlikely candidates. However, in the prestige order voted by the [[Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union|Supreme Soviet]] in 1975 Kulakov was ranked seventh.<ref>{{Cite book | author = Wesson, Robert G | title = Lenin's legacy: the story of the CPSU | location = | publisher = [[Hoover Press]] | year = 1978 | url = http://books.google.com/books?id=ppA1WjqExRwC&dq | page = 252 | isbn = 0817969225 }}</ref> During the later part of his life Kulakov's relations with Brezhnev, Chernenko and other leading officials seemed to have shifted in tone, leading Kulakov to be excluded from the 1978 Central Committee plenum on Agriculture. It has been presumed that Kulakov had shiftet his allegiance from Chernenko's faction to that of Kirilenko and Andropov. It should also be noted that Kulakov had also been in an argument with Gorbachev before his death.{{sfn|Hough|1997|p=67}}

==Death==
The most common assumued cause of Kulakov's death is of [[natural causes]], but there exist other versions as well. During Brezhnev's later term, according to some, which says Brezhnev was living in fear of [[Yuri Andropov]] during the later part of his life. These anonymous say that Andropov may have had something to do with the deaths of Kulakov in 1978, and later, [[Pyotr Masherov]] in 1980.<ref>{{Cite book | author = Seliktar, Ofira | title = Politics, paradigms, and intelligence failures: why so few predicted the collapse of the Soviet Union | location = | publisher = [[M.

However, those who had sworn allegiance to Kirilenko and Andropov were presents, this includes such important figures as [[Arv<U+012B>ds Pel<U+0161>e]], [[Kirill Mazurov]], [[Andrei Gromyko]] and [[Dmitriy Ustinov]].{{sfn|Hough|1997|p=68}}
