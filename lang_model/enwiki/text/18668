The '''Russian invasion of Crimea''' began at the end of February 2014, when [[Russia]]n forces seized control of civil buildings, airports, and military bases on the [[Ukraine|Ukrainian]] peninsula of [[Crimea]]. The Ukrainian response has been muted, with no military action on the part of Ukraine's government, which was installed in [[Kiev]] less than a week before the invasion.

==Prelude==
{{main|2014 Crimean crisis}}
{{see also|Euromaidan|2014 Ukrainian revolution}}
A civil uprising in [[Ukraine]] culminated in ousting President [[Viktor Yanukovich]] who fled from Kyiv [[Kiev]], the Ukrainian capital, on 22 February 2014 as protesters overthrew his regime and the opposition took control of the capital city and national government. <ref>{{cite news|url=http://world.time.com/2014/02/22/ukraines-president-flees-protestors-capture-kiev/|agency=TIME|title=Ukraine Protestors Seize Kiev As President Flees|date=22 February 2014|accessdate=1 March 2014}}</ref> Shortly thereafter, the Ukrainian Parliament [[Verkhovna Rada]] voted to restore the 2004 version of the [[Constitution of Ukraine]] and impeach the former president, Yanukovich. While on the run, Yanukovich declared his unwillingness to resign and some politicians from Ukraine's  [[eastern Ukraine|east]] and [[southern Ukraine|south]] regions, including Crimea,  declared continuing loyalty to Yanukovych.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/europe/2014/02/ukraine-parliament-ousts-president-yanukovich-2014222152035601620.html|agency=Al Jazeera English|title=Ukraine President Yanukovich impeached|date=22 February 2014|accessdate=1 March 2014}}</ref>

On 27 February 2014,  a pro-Russian politician, [[Sergey Aksyonov]], was hastily voted in as Crimea's prime minister when armed men in Russian military uniforms seized government buildings in Simferopol, the capital city of the [[Autonomous Republic of Crimea]] and ousted the prime minister appointed by the President of Ukraine. Aksyonov declared himself in charge of local military and law enforcement. On 1 March, the acting president of Ukraine, Oleksandr Turchynov decreed the Crimean legislature's appointment of Sergei Aksyonov as unconstitutional. The Crimean legislature has declared its intention to hold a referendum on greater autonomy from Kyiv on 25 May 2014.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2014-02-27/crimean-tatars-deported-by-stalin-rally-against-putin-in-crimea.html|agency=Bloomberg|title=Crimean Tatars Deported by Stalin Oppose Putin in Ukraine|date=27 February 2014|accessdate=1 March 2014}} </ref> 

Councilors in the Crimean city of [[Sevastopol, Ukraine|Sevastopol]], home to the Russian and Ukrainian Black Sea naval fleets, selected a Russian citizen as mayor, as pro-Russian demonstrators chanted "a Russian mayor for a Russian city".   Furthermore, Sevastopol's police chief said he would refuse orders from Kyiv.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/feb/25/ukraine-sevastopol-installs-pro-russian-mayor|agency=The Guardian|title=Ukraine: Sevastopol installs pro-Russian mayor as separatism fears grow|date=25 February 2014|accessdate=1 March 2014}}</ref> In Sevastopol, [[Kerch]], and other Crimean cities, pro-Russian demonstrators pulled down the [[flag of Ukraine]] and replaced it with the [[flag of Russia]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.focus-fen.net/news/2014/02/23/328121/demonstrators-raise-russian-flag-in-kerch.html|agency=Focus News|date=23 February 2014|accessdate=1 March 2014|title=Demonstrators raise Russian flag in Kerch}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.kyivpost.com/content/ukraine/no-ukrainian-flags-left-on-sevastopol-administrative-buildings-337812.html|agency=Kyiv Post|title=No Ukrainian flags left on Sevastopol administrative buildings|date=27 February 2014|accessdate=1 March 2014}}</ref>

The Russian invasion into Crimea started immediately after the press conference of former President [[Viktor Yanukovych]], held on 28 February 2014 in [[Rostov-on-Don]], near the eastern border of Ukraine, where he called for Putin to "restore order" in Ukraine.  Sergey Aksyonov also appealed to Russian President Vladimir Putin to provide assistance in ensuring the peace in the [[Autonomous Republic of Crimea]]. Putin swiftly responded and both houses of the Russian legislature (State Duma)  voted on 1 March 2014 to send Russian troops into Crimea. <ref> {{ [http://www.pravda.com.ua/articles/2014/03/1/7016683/ Putin declared war against Ukraine (in Ukrainian)]</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/m/story?id=22729336&ref=http%3A%2F%2Fnews.google.com%2F|title= Russian Troops Take Over Ukraine's Crimea Region|website=abcnews.go.com|accessdate=1 March 2014}}</ref>.

==Russian invasion==
On 26 February 2014, Russian-speaking gunmen in Russian military uniform, said to be Russian soldiers, established a checkpoint between the major Crimean cities of [[Sevastopol]] and [[Simferopol]].<ref>http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/world/tension-in-crimea-as-pro-russia-and-pro-ukraine-groups-stage-competing-rallies/article17110382/</ref><ref>http://edition.cnn.com/2014/02/26/world/europe/ukraine-politics</ref> On 27 February, gunmen in military uniform seized the [[Supreme Council of Crimea|Crimean parliamentary]] [[Building of the Supreme Council of Crimea|building]] and the [[Council of Ministers of Crimea|Council of Ministers building]] and replaced the Ukrainian flag with the Russian flag.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/feb/27/armed-men-seize-crimea-parliament-reports|agency=The Guardian|title=Armed men seize Crimea parliament|date=27 February 2014|accessdate=1 March 2014}}</ref>

On 28 February, gunmen accused by the [[Yatsenyuk Government|Ukrainian government]] of being Russian soldiers occupied [[Simferopol International Airport]] and [[Sevastopol International Airport]], while [[Western world|Western]] and independent media reported Russian troop movements in Crimea, including Russian military helicopters moving into the peninsula and [[Russian Army]] trucks approaching Simferopol, the Crimean capital.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-26379722|title=Ukraine crisis: 'Russians' occupy Crimea airports|agency=BBC News|date=28 February 2014|accessdate=1 March 2014}}</ref><ref>http://edition.cnn.com/video/data/2.0/video/world/2014/03/01/nr-magnay-russian-soldiers-present.cnn.html</ref> Ukrainian officials said Russian forces took over a military airbase in Sevastopol, landed troops at another airbase,<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/europe/pro-russia-separatists-flex-muscle-in-ukraines-crimean-peninsula/2014/02/27/dac10d54-9ff0-11e3-878c-65222df220eb_story.html?clsrd|agency=The Washington Post|title=Pro-Russia separatists flex muscles in Ukraine<U+2019>s Crimean Peninsula|date=28 February 2014|accessdate=1 March 2014}}</ref> and surrounded a coast guard base.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.stltoday.com/news/world/ukraine-s-state-border-guard-says-coast-guard-base-surrounded/article_c807c6c3-73f3-54bc-805a-f69695835724.html|agency=St. Louis Post-Dispatch|title=Ukraine's State Border Guard says coast guard base surrounded by about 30 Russian marines|date=28 February 2014|accessdate=1 March 2014}}</ref>

==Reactions==
===Crimean response===
Crimean Prime Minister Aksyonov asserted control over all security forces in Crimea and appealed to Putin for assistance in maintaining "peace and tranquility". He said officers who disagreed with his decision should resign.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/ukraine-crisis/crimea-pm-takes-control-army-police-seeks-russian-help-n41826|agency=NBC News|title=Crimea PM Takes Control Of Army, Police And Seeks Russian Help|date=1 March 2014|accessdate=1 March 2014}}</ref>

===Ukrainian response===
Interim Ukrainian President [[Oleksandr Turchynov]] accused Russia of "provoking a conflict" by invading Crimea. He compared Russia's military actions to the 2008 [[Russia<U+2013>Georgia war]], when Russian troops occupied parts of the [[Republic of Georgia]], and the breakaway enclaves of [[Abkhazia]] and [[South Ossetia]] were established under the control of Russian-backed administrations. He called on Putin to withdraw Russian troops from Crimea and stated that Ukraine will "preserve its territory" and "defend its independence".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.kyivpost.com/content/ukraine-abroad/turchynov-russia-waging-war-of-aggression-in-crimea-337972.html|agency=Kyiv Post|title=Turchynov: Russia starts aggression in Crimea|date=28 February 2014|accessdate=1 March 2014}}</ref> On 1 March, he warned, "Military intervention would be the beginning of war and the end of any relations between Ukraine and Russia."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/ukraine/10669670/Ukraine-live-Crimea-leader-appeals-to-Putin-to-help-as-Obama-warns-of-costs-to-Moscow.html|agency=The Telegraph|title=Ukraine live: Prime Minister of Ukraine says Russian military intervention would lead to war|date=1 March 2014|accessdate=1 March 2014}}</ref>

On the first day of war, Acting President Oleksandr Turchynov placed the Armed Forces of Ukraine on full alert and combat readiness. <ref> {{cite news/url=http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052702303801304579413443251173188?mg=reno64-wsj&url=http%3A%2F%2Fonline.wsj.com%2Farticle%2FSB10001424052702303801304579413443251173188.html}}</ref>

As Russia claimed that its invasion of Crimea was aimed at protecting Russians abroad, many rightfully compare the current crisis in Crimea with the [[Sudetenland#Sudeten_Crisis |Sudeten Crisis]] of [[1938]] in Czechoslovakia, which triggered the start of [[World War II]].
