'''West Burton Power Station''' is a [[Fossil fuel power plant|coal-fired power station]] in [[Bassetlaw]], north [[Nottinghamshire]], [[England]]. It is the furthest north of series of [[River Trent|Trent valley]] power stations, being within {{convert|2|mi|abbr=on}} of [[Gainsborough, Lincolnshire|Gainsborough]] in [[Lincolnshire]] and {{convert|39|mi|abbr=on}} from [[Ratcliffe-on-Soar Power Station]] near [[Nottingham]]. It is between [[Bole, Nottinghamshire|Bole]] to the north and [[Sturton le Steeple]] to the south. The station is accessed via the A620 near Bole. The [[Sheffield to Lincoln Line]] passes close to one set of its eight [[cooling tower]]s.

==History==
It is built on the site of the [[deserted medieval village]] of West Burton. The station is run by [[EDF Energy]].<ref>http://www.edfenergy.com/about-us/energy-generation/power-generation/coal.shtml EDF Energy</ref> It was originally operated by the [[CEGB]] and then run by [[National Power]] after privatisation, until April 1996 when it was bought by the [[Eastern Electricity|Eastern Group]] which became [[Energy Future Holdings Corporation|TXU Europe]]. In November 2001 when the price of electricity was low and TXU Europe had severe financial problems, it was bought by the London Power Company for <U+00A3>366m. In October 2003, a <U+00A3>100M [[Flue gas desulfurization|flue gas desulphurisation]] project opened, after three years of construction by [[Arup|Arup Energy]] and [[Mowlem]].<ref>http://www.arup.com/energy/project.cfm?pageid=3029 Flue Gas Desulphurisation</ref> New SOFA (separated over-fire air) burners were installed in 2007 to meet EU [[Nitrogen oxide]] emission legislation. The station also has a ''Discovery Centre'' to educate local school children.

==Specification==
The power station provides electricity for around two million people, and is situated on a {{convert|410|acre|km2|sing=on}} site. Coal for the power station, like [[Cottam Power Station|Cottam]], comes from the [[Welbeck colliery]] at [[Meden Vale]]. This will only be until 2009, when its coal is expected to run out. The station's other supplier, [[Thoresby colliery]], is expected to last longer. The station connects to the National Grid, like most similar sized coal power stations, via a [[transformer]] and [[Electrical substation|substation]] at 400kV.

==Combined cycle gas turbine power station==
A <U+00A3>600m 1,270MWe [[Combined cycle|CCGT]] power station, which will run on [[natural gas]], is currently being built next to the coal-fired station.<ref>http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/lincolnshire/7076589.stm CCGT power station approved in November 2007</ref> Construction by the [[Kier Group]] started in January 2008. It is being built on land originally allocated for a proposed 1,800MW West Burton 'B' coal power station that was to have been built in the 1980s. Privatisation of the electricity industry in 1990 cancelled this scheme. It will be finished in 2011, and will supply electricity to around 1.5 million homes. A new {{convert|12|mi|abbr=on}} [[Pipeline transport|gas pipeline]] is being built to link to the National Gas Transmission System at [[Grayingham]] in Lincolnshire. Around 1,000 people are involved in the construction. The plant will consist of three 270MWe [[gas turbine]]s each with a [[heat recovery steam generator]].
