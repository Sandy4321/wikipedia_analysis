==Biography==
Little Heroes were formed from the remnants of The Secret Police.  The Secret Police were a popular Melbourne rock band, comprising vocalist/guitarist/songwriter Roger Hart(aka Roger Wells), bassist [[John C. J. Taylor|John Taylor]], drummer Bruce Pumpa, guitarist Andrew Callender, and saxophonist Peter Linley.<ref name="ARDb">{{cite web |url=http://hem.passagen.se/honga/database/l/littleheroes.html |title=Little Heroes |publisher=Australian Rock Database |editor=Magnus Holmgren |accessdate=2008-12-17}}</ref> Secret Police did not issue any records, although posthumously the band contributed the tracks "Emotion" and "Everybody Looks Lonely at Night" to Missing Links' 1981 compilation album ''The Melbourne Club''.<ref name="McF">{{cite book |title=[[Encyclopedia of Australian Rock and Pop]] |url=  |last=McFarlane |first=Ian |authorlink= Ian McFarlane |publisher=[[Allen & Unwin]] |year=1999 |chapter=Encyclopedia entry for 'Little Heroes' |chapterurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20040829235034/www.whammo.com.au/encyclopedia.asp?articleid=1018|isbn=1864487682 |accessdate=2008-01-16}}</ref>  In 1980 Hart, Taylor and Pumpa joined keyboardist David Crosbie (of non-Stills, Nash & Young association) to start a new band called The Little Heroes.<ref name="ARDb"/> 

The new line-up competed in the Victorian State heat of the 1980 Battle of the Sounds, finishing a creditable second. The result was enough to advance The Little Heroes to the national final in [[Sydney, New South Wales|Sydney]], which they won, earning $5000.<re name="McF"/> This resulted in the band recording and releasing their debut single "She Says"/"Coming Home" in November 1980.<ref name="McF"/>  On the strength of this independent release they were signed to the Giant Records/[[CBS Records|CBS]] label to record their debut album. 

Prior to recording the album the band recruited a new drummer, Huk Treloar (ex-Bleeding Hearts) to replace Pumpa.<ref name="ARDb"/><ref name="McF"/>  The band's self titled debut album was released in August, 1981 and reached #81 on the Australian album charts.  It produced the singles "For a Bleeding Heart"/"She Says" (March, 1981), "Last Number One"/"Catch Me" (June, 1981), and "India Was Calling Me"/"Pretty Shadow" (September, 1981) all of which failed to chart. At the end of 1981 Alan 'Clutch' Robertson then replaced Treloar on drums.<ref name="ARDb"/><ref name="McF"/>

In early 1982 the band's undertook the recording of their second album, ''Play by Numbers'', (now with [[EMI Records]]) at Armstrong Studios in Melbourne, and then at the EMI studios in Sydney. The advance single, "One Perfect Day", was released in May, 1982 and reached #12 nationally and #6 in [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]].<ref name="Kent">{{cite book |title=[[Kent Music Report|Australian Chart Book 1970&ndash;1992]] |format=doc |last=Kent |first=David |authorlink= David Kent|publisher=Australian Chart Book, St Ives, N.S.W. |year=1993 |isbn=0-646-11917-6 |accessdate=2008-12-11 }} NOTE: Used for Australian Singles and Albums charting until ARIA created their own charts in mid-1988.</ref>  Those recording sessions also produced a second single "Young Hearts", which reached #35 on the national singles charts.<ref name="Kent"/>  The lineup of Hart, Crosbie, Taylor and Robertson then toured Australia to promote the successful "One Perfect Day".

Martin Fisher (ex-Breakers) then replaced Crosbie on keyboards, and Peter Leslie replaced Taylor on bass. <ref name="ARDb"/><ref name="McF"/> The new lineup (Hart, Robertson, Leslie, Fisher) completed recording the second album, ''Play by Numbers'' at 301 Studios in Sydney with Australian producer Dave Marrett.  The album was released in August, 1982 and peaked at #37 on the national album charts.<ref name="Kent"/>  It also yielded a third single, "Saturday (Afternoon) Inside" released In October 1982, which failed to chart.  The album was supported by a six month national tour. 

Fisher and Leslie left to join [[Dear Enemy (band)|Dear Enemy]] and were replaced by Paul Brickhill (ex-MEO-245) on keyboards and bass player, Rick Loriot (ex-Inserts) at the end of 1982.  Loriot only lasted four months and was in turn replaced by Anthony Tavasz (ex-Modesty).<ref name="ARDb"/><ref name="McF"/>
 
The band added guitarist Paul Bell, which allowed Hart more freedom as lead vocalist<ref name="McF"/> and they then (Hart, Robertson, Bell, Brickhill, Tavasz) traveled to the [[United Kingdom]] in June 1983 to record their third album, ''Watch the World'' at Farmyard Studios with UK producer [[Rupert Hine]] ([[The Fixx]], [[Howard Jones]]).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.discogs.com/release/912517 |publisher=Discogs|title=Little Heroes - Watch The World|accessdate=2008-12-17}}</ref><ref name="McF"/> The album was released in September 1983 and reached #24 nationally.<ref name="Kent"/>  The first single, "Watch the World", released in August, 1983 reached #73, with the second single, "Bon Voyage", released in November, 1983 reaching #51<ref name="Kent"/>, whilst the third single "Modern Times", released in March, 1984 failing to chart.<ref name="McF"/>  To support the release of "Watch The World" the band toured Australia over a six month period.

In June, 1984 Roger Hart/Wells announced he was leaving the band and as a result the Little Heroes was formally disbanded.<ref name="McF"/>
