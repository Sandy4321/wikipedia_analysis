'''Al Groh''' (born July 13, 1944) is the defensive coordinator of the [[Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets]] [[Georgia Tech football|football team]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.ajc.com/sports/georgia-tech/groh-accepts-georgia-tech-275893.html|title=Groh accepts Georgia Tech post|publisher=[[Atlanta Journal-Constitution]]|date=2010-01-15|accessdate=2010-01-15}}</ref>  He is also a former [[head coach]] of the [[University of Virginia]] [[Virginia Cavaliers football|football team]], a former head coach of the [[Wake Forest Demon Deacons football|Wake Forest Demon Deacons football team]] and the former head coach of the [[New York Jets]] of the [[NFL]]. He is a two-time [[Atlantic Coast Conference]] Coach of the Year, winning the award in 2002 and 2007. Groh has over 38 years of professional and collegiate coaching experience; this history includes 13 seasons in the NFL, a [[Super Bowl]] title with the [[1990 New York Giants season|New York Giants]], and over a decade of working under coach [[Bill Parcells]].

==Personal life==
Born in New York City, Groh is a native of [[Manhasset, New York]], on the [[North Shore (Long Island)|North Shore]] of [[Long Island]].<ref>Eskenazi, Gerald.

He is also a 1967 graduate of the [[University of Virginia]]<U+2019>s [[McIntire School of Commerce]].<ref>Eskenazi, Gerald. "[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B04EEDB1F3DF937A15752C0A9669C8B63&sec=&spon=&pagewanted=2 PRO FOOTBALL; Teacher and Storyteller, Groh Is Now on Center Stage]", ''[[The New York Times]]'', January 24, 2000. Accessed December 3, 2007. "Groh was a varsity football star at Chaminade High School and then the University of Virginia."</ref> He returned to his alma mater in 2001 as the head coach of the [[Virginia Cavaliers football|Cavaliers]] football team. His son [[Mike Groh]] was a high school football star at [[Randolph High School (New Jersey)|Randolph High School]] in [[Randolph, New Jersey]] who kicked the game winning field goal in ''[[The Star-Ledger]]'''s "Greatest High School Football Game Ever Played" in 1990. Mike was formerly his father's offensive coordinator, quarterback coach, and recruiting coordinator for the Cavaliers.

==Playing history==
Groh played for the University of Virginia football team from 1963<U+2013>65, lettering at defensive end in 1965. A two-sport athlete, Groh also lettered on defense for the [[Virginia Cavaliers men's lacrosse|Cavalier lacrosse team]].

==Coaching career==
===College===
Throughout his career, Groh has been a friend and prot<U+00E9>g<U+00E9> of [[Bill Parcells]], working with him for over 13 years in both collegiate and professional positions. Groh was an assistant under Parcells in two Super Bowls, including a 1990 [[Super Bowl XXV]] victory with the [[New York Giants]] and a 1996 loss in [[Super Bowl XXXI]] with the [[New England Patriots]].

Groh began his college coaching career in 1968 as the defensive coach of the plebe squad at [[Army Black Knights football|Army]], working with Parcells for his first time. Groh returned to Virginia in 1970 as head coach of the freshmen team and later defensive line coach. From 1973 through 1977, he was an assistant at [[North Carolina Tar Heels football|North Carolina]], followed by a year (1978) as Parcells<U+2019> [[defensive coordinator]] at [[Air Force Falcons football|Air Force]] and a year at [[Texas Tech Red Raiders football|Texas Tech]] in 1980. Groh received his first head football coach experience with [[Wake Forest University|Wake Forest]] from 1981 through 1986 where his record was 26<U+2013>40.

===NFL===
In 1987, Groh made his NFL debut as the special teams and tight ends coach of the [[Atlanta Falcons]]. After a brief return to the college ranks in 1988 as the [[offensive coordinator]] for [[South Carolina Gamecocks football|South Carolina]], Groh joined the [[New York Giants]] coaching staff. He served as the Giants<U+2019> linebackers coach from 1989 to 1990 and as [[defensive coordinator]] in 1991. Groh<U+2019>s expertise in [[linebacker]]s led to [[Bill Belichick]] hiring him as an assistant with the [[Cleveland Browns]] in 1992. Groh then reunited with Parcells in New England from 1993 to 1996 as the defensive coordinator, following him to the [[New York Jets]] as the linebacker coach from 1997 through 1999.

Groh served as Head Coach of the New York Jets for the [[2000 NFL season|2000 season]], resigning after one year to pursue the job at his alma mater, University of Virginia.

===Virginia Cavaliers===
Groh was named the head coach of the Cavaliers on December 30, 2000, succeeding [[George Welsh (coach)|George Welsh]], who retired as the winningest coach in school and [[Atlantic Coast Conference]] history. At Virginia, Groh has become known for his implementing a [[3-4 defense]], rare for the college game, and for maintaining his NFL mentality. After a 5<U+2013>7 record in 2001, Groh led Virginia to four consecutive winning seasons and three bowl victories before another 5<U+2013>7 campaign in 2006. He was named the ACC Coach of the Year in 2002 and 2007.

====2001====
Groh<U+2019>s first year as Virginia<U+2019>s head coach contained struggles both on and off the field. The 2001 Cavalier team posted a 5<U+2013>7 record, and Groh, a native of New York City and [[Long Island]], was involved in controversy surrounding comments regarding the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]] in his hometown. In response to a reporter's question about whether he and his team should be afraid to fly their charter plane to [[Clemson University|Clemson]] soon thereafter, Groh stated "I'm not saying this to make light of it by any means, but I'm not planning on having Arabs in the traveling party, so therefore I think probably that the threat of our being hijacked is pretty remote."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9801E0D9103BF933A1575AC0A9679C8B63&n=Top%2FReference%2FTimes%20Topics%2FPeople%2FG%2FGroh%2C%20Al|title=Groh Apologizes For Remark|date=2001-09-20|accessdate=2008-12-04|work=The New York Times}}</ref>  Both Groh and the President of the University, [[John T. Casteen III]], apologized and recognized the inappropriateness of the remarks. Subsequent to the 2001 season, Groh was selected as the defensive head coach of the Gray team in the 64th Annual [[Blue-Gray Football Classic]]; [[Al Golden (American football)|Al Golden]] joined Groh on the Gray team's coaching staff.

====2002====
During Groh<U+2019>s second year as head coach, Virginia amassed a 9<U+2013>5 record with a schedule ranked the 11th toughest in the nation by [[Jeff Sagarin]] of ''[[USA Today]]'', and Groh was voted the ACC Coach of the Year.

====2005====
{{Expand section|date=August 2011}}
<!--Night game win and pitch invasion vs. FSU is pretty notable-->

====2006====
{{main|2006 Virginia Cavaliers football team}}

The 2006 Cavaliers were a young team with several new assistant coaches. The team experienced some growing pains, and a few games into the season, freshman [[Jameel Sewell]] earned the starting quarterback position, leading Virginia to a 5<U+2013>7 season record. No Cavalier player made first team All-ACC team for the first time in 20 years. While Groh acknowledged that the year would be a rebuilding experience and a slow start upset some fans, Virginia [[athletic director]] [[Craig Littlepage]] stated that, "Al will be our head coach" through at least the 2007 season.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/10/15/AR2006101501079.html?nav=hcmodule|title=AD Says Groh Will Stay at U-Va.|date=2006-10-16|accessdate=2008-12-04|last=Kilgore|first=Adam|work=The Washington Post}}</ref>
Littlepage, however, later refused to exercise an option to extend Groh's contract by one year stating that Virginia's expectations were higher than 5<U+2013>7.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.charlottesvillenewsplex.tv/sports/headlines/4797136.html|title=Virginia Will Not Exercise Option to Extend Contract of Al Groh|date=2006-12-01|accessdate=2008-12-04|publisher=CBS News 19 (wcav.tv)|author=J.W. Stehle}}</ref>  Unlike past seasons, Groh only played one true freshman in 2006, which preserved the [[Redshirt (college sports)|redshirt]] of true freshman.

====2007====
{{main|2007 Virginia Cavaliers football team}}

In the 2007 preseason, Groh was listed among the five worst coaches in college football by ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'' columnist [[Stewart Mandel]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2007/writers/stewart_mandel/07/10/mailbag/1.html |title=Head man hierarchy: Unveiling the nation's 10 best and five worst coaches |author=Mandel, Stewart   |date=2007-07-11 |work=Sports Illustrated |accessdate=2010-03-25 |authorlink= Stewart Mandel}}</ref> However, after Groh's 2007 Cavaliers lost their first game at Wyoming, they won their next seven games and started 4<U+2013>0 in the ACC. After Virginia won their ninth game of 2007, Stewart Mandel stated "there's no question he's gotten every ounce out of that team," and revisited his preseason column by stating "I ended up going with Groh, and obviously he's the one who's most proven it wrong."  The team finished the regular season 9<U+2013>3 overall and 6<U+2013>2 in the ACC, leading to the Cavaliers' fifth bowl game in the past six seasons. Subsequent to the regular season, Groh was voted the 2007 ACC Coach of the Year by the ACC Media Association.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.theacc.com/sports/m-footbl/spec-rel/112707aab.html |title=Virginia's Al Groh Named 2007 ACC Coach of the Year |date=2007-11-27 |work=[[Atlantic Coast Conference]] |publisher=CBS Interactive |accessdate=2010-03-25}}</ref>

====2008====
{{main|2008 Virginia Cavaliers football team}}

After leading his team to a 1<U+2013>3 start, including a 31<U+2013>3 loss to a [[2008 Duke Blue Devils football team|Duke]] team who had not won an ACC game in its previous 25 attempts, Groh was once again faced with widespread pleas from fans and the media to resign.<ref>[http://www.inrich.com/cva/ric/news.apx.-content-articles-RTD-2008-10-01-0094.html]</ref><ref>[http://www.inrich.com/cva/ric/sports/colleges.apx.-content-articles-RTD-2008-10-01-0169.html]</ref> However, Virginia quickly turned the season around, reeling off 4 straight wins with the emergence of Marc Verica and the efforts of [[Cedric Peerman]]. It wasn't until November 1, that [[2008 Miami Hurricanes football team|Miami]] coming into Charlottesville during homecoming that Virginia lost in overtime ending Virginia's winning streak and knocking them out of the top spot in the ACC Coastal Division. They subsequently lost to [[2008 Wake Forest Demon Deacons football team|Wake Forest]], [[2008 Clemson Tigers football team|Clemson]] and [[2008 Virginia Tech Hokies football team|Virginia Tech]]. This marks the fifth straight loss to the Hokies.  They last beat Virginia Tech in 2003, their only win against the team under Groh. Virginia's final for 2008 is 5<U+2013>7 and 3<U+2013>5 in the ACC.

====2009====
{{main|2009 Virginia Cavaliers football team}}

Groh and his Virginia team opened the 2009 season with a shocking home loss to [[William & Mary Tribe football|William & Mary]] of the FCS (formerly I-AA). Groh's decision to field three quarterbacks in a spread offense for the game led to a record-tying seven turnovers for the Cavaliers. The loss was the first by Virginia to a I-AA team since 1986, which also came at the hands of William & Mary. The embarrassment of the loss coupled with fears of another losing season once again rekindled calls for Groh's ouster as Virginia head coach from many fans and analysts.<ref>[http://www.cavalierdaily.com/2009/09/10/the-boo-crew/]</ref><ref>[http://www.cavalierdaily.com/2009/09/10/football-faux-pas/]</ref>

Following the William & Mary loss, the Cavaliers fell to TCU in Charlottesville and then Southern Mississippi in Hattiesburg, MS.

Following a bye week, Groh's Virginia team rebounded and reeled off three straight wins, including two road ACC wins (North Carolina and Maryland) and a blow-out over the Big Ten's Indiana.  However, after the three straight wins, Virginia reeled off 6 straight losses to close the season.

Following a loss to Virginia Tech in the last game of the season, the University of Virginia fired Al Groh.<ref>[http://www2.newsadvance.com/lna/news/local/article/groh_fired_as_uva_coach/21843/]</ref>

====Legacy====
While Groh was at Virginia, 13 Cavaliers were selected in the [[NFL Draft]], while 19 others signed pro contracts as free agents. During his first five years, Groh maintained a strategy of hiring young, ambitious assistants, and he hoped to build a network of prot<U+00E9>g<U+00E9>s through the football ranks. His assistants have gone on to become head coaches at other [[Division I (NCAA)|Division I]]-A programs: ([[Ron Prince]] at [[Kansas State Wildcats football|Kansas State]], [[Al Golden (football)|Al Golden]] at [[Miami Hurricanes football|University of Miami]], [[Mike London]] in the Division I-AA [[Richmond Spiders football|University of Richmond]] and Danny Rocco, who left Groh's staff after the 2005 season to become head coach at I-AA [[Liberty University]].  After the 2009 season [[Mike London]] replaced Groh as UVA's head football coach).  A number of assistants have also gone into the ranks of assistants in the NFL ([[Bill Musgrave]], previously with the [[Jacksonville Jaguars]] and [[Washington Redskins]], now at the [[Atlanta Falcons]], and [[Mike London]] at the [[Houston Texans]] before returning to Groh's staff and then taking the Richmond job).

Under Groh, Virginia had a 3<U+2013>2 record in bowl games, with the two losses coming to [[Fresno State Bulldogs football|Fresno State]] in the [[2004 Humanitarian Bowl|2004 MPC Computers Bowl]] and [[Texas Tech Red Raiders football team|Texas Tech]] in the [[2008 Gator Bowl]]. The Cavaliers defeated [[West Virginia Mountaineers football|West Virginia]] in the [[2002 Continental Tire Bowl]] and [[Pittsburgh Panthers football|Pittsburgh]] in the [[2003 Continental Tire Bowl]] and [[Minnesota Golden Gophers football team|Minnesota]] in the [[2005 Music City Bowl]].

===Georgia Tech===
On January 15, 2010, it was announced that Al Groh would be taking the position of defensive coordinator at Georgia Tech for the 2010 season.<ref>[http://msn.foxsports.com/cfb/story/Al-Groh-Georgia-Tech-defensive-coordinator-011510]</ref>
