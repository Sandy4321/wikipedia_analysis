==Description==
The Charles G. Janson Garage is a two-story commercial building constructed of brick.<ref name = "MISHPO"/>  The original section of the building is a deep building with a narrow front, a gently sloping roof, and a steppet [[parapet]] on either side.  The second floor is relatively shallow.  The front facade is faced with dark red brick and the remaining sides are faced with a yellow brick.  The front has a wide center entrance originally used as an auto entry, but since converted to a double-door with [[sidelight]]s.  Two large shop windows are placed on either side of the entrance, and a large central window, flanked by narrower windows, is in the upper story.<ref name = "MISHPO"/>

A single-story brick addition is connected to the side of the original building well back from the street, giving the overall plan an L-shape.<ref name = "MISHPO"/>  The addition originally had three garage bays and a large window in front; the garage entrances have since been converted to doors.<ref name = "MISHPO"/>
