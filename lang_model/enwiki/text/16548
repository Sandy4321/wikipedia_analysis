'''Shane Robert Watson''' (born 17 June 1981) is an Australian [[cricket]]er. He is a right-handed batsman and a right-handed fast medium bowler. He mainly bats as an opener in international cricket, although he does not do so domestically.

He debuted for the [[Australian cricket team]] in 2002, playing his first One Day International against South Africa. While he has become a regular member of the one-day squad, Watson has played few Test Matches for Australia, having debuted against [[Pakistani cricket team|Pakistan]] at the [[Sydney Cricket Ground]] in January 2005. Despite being allocated to be Australia's designated Test all-rounder, injuries have often prevented him from claiming his position in the Test team.  However, from the second half of 2009, Watson acted as Australian Test opening batsman, along with [[Simon Katich]].

Watson was awarded the 2010 [[Allan Border Medal]] and again in 2011, becoming the second player (after [[Ricky Ponting]]) to win back-to back Allan Border Medals. Watson's wife Lee, whom he married on 3 June 2010, is a [[Fox Sports Australia]] presenter.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/lifestyle/people/sports-golden-couple-tie-knot-in-unassuming-style-20100529-wmfq.html|title=Sport's golden couple tie knot in unassuming style  |last=Casamento|first=Jo|publisher=Sydney Morning Herald|accessdate=2010-05-30 | date=30 May 2010}}</ref>

He was declared man of the series in the [[2012 ICC World Twenty20]] for scoring a total of 249 with an average of 49.80, while taking 11 wickets with the ball.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.wisdenindia.com/cricket-news/shane-watson-named-player-tournament/29858| title= Shane Watson named Player of the Tournament| publisher = Wisden India | date=7 October 2012}}</ref>

==Playing career==

===Early career===
Watson was an AIS [[Australian Cricket Academy]] scholarship holder in 2000.<ref>{{cite book|title=Excellence : the Australian Institute of Sport|year=2002|publisher=Australian Sports Commission|location=Canberra}}</ref> He started his [[first-class cricket]]ing career for [[Tasmanian cricket team|Tasmania]] after leaving his home state of [[Queensland]], but returned to play for his native [[Queensland cricket team|Queensland]] as his international career was beginning. He has also played for [[Hampshire County Cricket Club|Hampshire]] in the English [[County Championship]] in 2005. He regards [[Terry Alderman]] as one of his mentors.

===International career===
Watson was selected for his first Australian team in early 2002, being selected to tour South Africa with the Test team after topping the [[Pura Cup]] wicket-taking charts for Tasmania, as well as steady middle-order batting performances. Australian captain at the time [[Steve Waugh]] stated that Watson would possibly be Australia's first genuine [[all rounder]] since [[Keith Miller]] and [[Alan Davidson (cricketer)|Alan Davidson]] in the 1950s. Watson expressed joy at being selected in an Australian team with Waugh, whom he cited as his idol. Watson scored an unbeaten century on his debut in a tour match, but did not play in the Tests as the selectors retained the same XI that had swept South Africa 3<U+2013>0 in the Australian season. Watson did make his ODI debut on tour, ironically replacing Waugh, who was sacked after the team failed to make the ODI finals in the preceding Australian summer. Watson continued as a regular member of the ODI team until he suffered three stress fractures in his back, at the start of 2003, missing the [[2003 Cricket World Cup]]. He was replaced by his Queensland teammate [[Andrew Symonds]], who proceeded to establish his position as the all rounder after scoring 143* and 91* during the tournament.

Watson's injury sidelined him until the 2003<U+2013>04 Australian season, and during his rehabilitation he played most of the season as a batsman, allowing himself to improve his batting skills while his back was still healing. During this time he smashed an unbeaten 300* for his club side, [[Lindisfarne Cricket Club|Lindisfarne]].

Watson returned to regular ODI duty in the 2004<U+2013>05 season, as a bowling all rounder. He also played in the Third Test against [[Pakistani cricket team|Pakistan]] as the fifth bowler, in order to allow Australia to play two spinners and three pace bowlers on a dry [[Sydney Cricket Ground]] pitch.

Following [[England cricket team|England]]'s Ashes victory over Australia in 2005 with a five bowler strategy, Australia responded by including Watson as the fifth bowler and all rounder in all Test matches. Watson stated his intention to emulate [[Andrew Flintoff]], who played the analogous role for England. Watson played against the [[ICC World XI]] in the role, but he dislocated his shoulder in just his second Test in that designated role against the [[West Indies cricket team|West Indies]], after diving to field a ball. Watson was again replaced by Symonds and was unable to represent Australia for the remainder of the summer.

He was recalled for the one day squad for the 2006 tour of South Africa but was dropped when all-rounder [[Andrew Symonds]] returned from injury. Watson was looking to establish a place in the Test side when he got injured, and Andrew Symonds stepped in to fill the gap.

Watson had been previously criticised for his relatively flat bowling trajectory and inability to move the ball, reflected in his relatively high bowling average. [[Jamie Cox]], a former Tasmanian team-mate and future Australian selector, felt that Watson was being mis-used as a bowling allrounder, believing that he was better suited as a conventional batsman and part-timer bowler, rather than a bowler who engaged in power hitting in the latter part of an innings.

This changed when Watson opened the batting for Australia at the [[2006 ICC Champions Trophy]], alongside wicket-keeper Adam Gilchrist, instead of [[Simon Katich]].  In the competition he impressed with both the ball and bat, as Australia moved to their first Champions Trophy victory. Critics and captain [[Ricky Ponting]] cited his better strike rate, straight hitting and the ability to bowl as the reasons why he was selected ahead of Katich. After failing in the first two matches against the West Indies and England, Watson made a 50 in Australia's victory over India, which sealed their place in the semi-finals, and in the 2009 Champions Trophy was held in South Africa, Watson again played a prominent role, making two consecutive 100s against England and New-Zealand in semi-final and final, helping Australia to defend their title.

Ponting suggested that Watson would bat at the number 6 position in the Ashes series against England in 2006<U+2013>07, and he was named in the squad. However, he came off the ground in a one-day domestic game the week before the first Test with a suspected hamstring tear, which ruled him out for the first three Tests. [[Michael Clarke (cricketer)|Michael Clarke]] was called up in Watson's place, and responded with a half-century, and then a century to cement Clarke's place in the team.

Watson was expected to be fit for the fourth Test on Boxing Day and the [[MCG]] in Melbourne, and because of [[Damien Martyn]]'s unexpected retirement, it looked likely that Watson would be included in the side. However, another injury setback in a match for Queensland ruled Watson out for the rest of the Ashes series. Watson eventually returned in February to the ODI side, replacing [[Cameron White]] in the all rounder position, However he again broke down with injury during the [[2007 Cricket World Cup]] and missed most of the Super 8's before returning in fine style smashing an unbeaten 65 off 32 balls against New Zealand. Injury again struck Watson in the early stages of the [[2007 ICC World Twenty20]] as he missed most of the tournament due to [[hamstring]] strain. He was then out of action for the 2007<U+2013>08 Australian season.

After Symonds was omitted from the Australian team for disciplinary reasons, and Watson took the all rounder's position for the tour of India in late-2008, batting at No. 6. During the Third Test in Delhi, he was involved in a series of confrontations with Indian opener [[Gautam Gambhir]], who scored a double century and reached his century by lofting Watson over midwicket for six. During the innings, Gambhir elbowed Watson while going for a run, and claimed that the incident was not intentional at a press conference, and claiming that Watson had no capacity to dismiss him. He later pleaded guilty and was banned for one match.

After returning to Australia, Symonds was recalled to the Test team and both all rounders played in the First Test against New Zealand in Brisbane. As the pitch was a green, rain-affected moist surface expected to favour seamers, spinner [[Jason Krejza]] was dropped to accommodate two seam bowling all rounders. After the match, which Australia won, Watson was dropped as spinner [[Nathan Hauritz]] was included and Symonds retained. Symonds continued to perform poorly, and there were calls for Watson to take his place, but both men then fell injured at the end of the year, Watson with a stress fracture. Watson returned to international duty in the ODI series against Pakistan in the UAE, scoring a century.

He returned to the Australian Test side for the 3rd Ashes Test match at Edgbaston on 30 July 2009 when he replaced opener [[Phillip Hughes]] who had been struggling for form. In a rain interrupted match he made 62 and 53 batting alongside [[Simon Katich]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cricinfo.com/engvaus2009/engine/current/match/345972.html|title=Scorecard: England v Australia, 3rd Test at Edgbaston, 30 July<U+2013>3 August 2009|publisher=Cricinfo|accessdate=2009-08-01}}</ref>  He scored his second highest Test score of 96 against the West Indies in the Second Test in Adelaide in December 2009. He and Katich put on a century stand and he had reached 96 at stumps, only to inside edge his first ball of the next morning onto his stumps while attempting to hit a boundary to reach his century. In the Third Test, he made 89 in another century stand with Katich. In the second innings, he removed opposition captain Chris Gayle and then charged towards him, screaming in celebration directly in front of him. This earned him a fine from the match referee, and considerable criticism from much of the Australian public.

In the First Test against Pakistan, he made 93 runs on Boxing Day and featured in his third century stand in as many matches with Katich, but was run out after a mix-up with Katich in which both players ended up running towards the same end, again falling short of his debut Test hundred. On Day four, Watson finally made his first Test hundred. He went to lunch sitting on 98* and including the lunch break was stuck in the 90s for 106 minutes. After the lunch break he got to 99, and was then stuck there and could only get dot balls. He brought up his debut Test century in interesting style, hitting the ball hard to [[Abdur Rauf (cricketer)|Abdur Rauf]] at point who put the catch down. The ball spilled away and gave Watson enough time to run through for the single he needed. His century came after 293 minutes off 186 balls with 9 fours and a six. When Ponting declared, he remained not out, making 120.  Watson was awarded man of the match on 30 December for his role in Australia's Test victory.

In the second innings of the Second Test at the SCG, Watson fell short of another century, dismissed for 97. During this Test, the Australian Cricket Media Association presented Watson with Australian Cricketer of the Year Award.<ref>[http://www.theroar.com.au/2010/01/10/watson-named-australias-best-by-the-media/ Watson named Australia's best by the media], The Roar, Retrieved on 11 January 2010</ref>

In the first test of Australia's 2010 tour of India, Watson opened his account with his second test century <U+2013> an attritional 126 runs off 338 balls on a slow, low Mohali pitch.  The innings capped an excellent start to the tour, as he also scored a century in each innings of the warm-up match, albeit at a much brisker pace.  He topscored again in the second innings with a run-a-ball 56, which proved vital in setting a competitive target as Australia's middle order again collapsed in spectacular fashion following his dismissal.

On 30 March 2011, Watson was named test and ODI vice-captain.<ref>{{cite news|title=BBC News|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/cricket/other_international/australia/9440536.stm|accessdate=30 March 2011 | date=30 March 2011}}</ref> On 11 April 2011 he made 185 not out off 96 balls [[Australian cricket team in Bangladesh in 2011|against Bangladesh]]. Watson hit 15 sixes in this innings, breaking the record previously held by [[Xavier Marshall]]. He also scored the highest one day international score by an Australian batsman passing [[Matthew Hayden]]'s score of 181 not out set in 2007.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/cricket/13035935.stm|title=Shane Watson hits world-record 15 sixes as Aussies win|date=11 April 2011|accessdate=11 April 2011|publisher=BBC Sport}}</ref> Due to injuries in the home series against [[South African cricket team in Australia in 2012<U+2013>13|South Africa]] and [[Sri Lankan cricket team in Australia in 2012<U+2013>13|Sri Lanka]], he decided to become a top order batsman instead of an allrounder.

====T20 World Cup 2012====
In the [[2012 ICC World Twenty20]], he showed sublime all-round form. In the first match against [[Ireland cricket team|Ireland]] at [[R.Premadasa Stadium]] in [[Colombo]], he opened the bowling & took 3/26 (wickets of opener-captain [[William Porterfield]], keeper-batsman [[Niall O'Brien (cricketer)|Niall O'Brien]] and dangerous [[Kevin O'Brien (cricketer)|Kevin O'Brien]]) and then scored a breezy 51 from 30 to help his side win the match in 15.1 overs. He was subsequently awarded the [[Man of the Match]]. In the next match against [[West Indies cricket team|West Indies]] he again opened bowling & batting, took 2/29 from 4 overs(wickets of devastating [[Chris Gayle]] & [[Kieron Pollard]]) and then scored 41* from 24 balls to win [[Man of the Match]] as his side won by 17 runs (by [[Duckworth-Lewis method]]). Against [[Indian cricket team|India]], he was used as 2nd change bowler & took 3/34. It was he who had changed the game by taking the wickets of [[Yuvraj Singh]] and opener [[Irfan Pathan]] in 11th over. He also dismissed dangerous [[Suresh Raina]] in the last over. he followed it up with a 72 from 42 balls (7 sixes & 2 fours), and had an 133-run opening partnership in 13.3 overs with [[David Warner (cricketer)|David Warner]] making a mockery of the target 141. Against [[South Africa cricket team|South Africa]], he took 2/29 (wickets of [[Hashim Amla]] and [[AB de Villiers]]) and then followed it up with 70 from 47 balls to win 4 consecutive [[Man of the Match]] awards.

===Indian Premier League===
Watson played in the [[Indian Premier League]] for the [[Rajasthan Royals]] team. Signed up for US $125,000, he performed well with both the bat and the ball scoring four half-centuries to anchor his team to victory in three matches of the tournament and in the semifinals. He also picked up 17 wickets, won four man of the match awards in his first twelve games and also won the Man of the Series award.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://content-aus.cricinfo.com/magazine/content/story/352688.html|title=Five Finds|work=Cricinfo Magazine|last=Sangakkara|first=Kumar|publisher=Crincinfo|accessdate=2009-07-27}}</ref>

On the back of his IPL performance, Watson was subsequently selected to replace [[Matthew Hayden]] in the one day series as part of [[Australian cricket team in the West Indies in 2008|Australia's tour to the West Indies]], after Hayden had injured himself during the IPL season.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://content-aus.cricinfo.com/australia/content/current/story/353503.html|title=Watson called to fill Hayden's one-day shoes|publisher=Cricinfo|accessdate=2009-07-27}}</ref> Watson went on to establish himself as an ODI opener in the series.

Watson missed the second IPL season due to national duty and injury, and Rajasthan failed to reach the top four in the qualifying rounds. For 2011 season, Rajasthan Royals successfully retained Shane Watson along with the skipper [[Shane Warne]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://indianexpress.com/news/Royals-retain-Warne--Watson/721832.html|title=Royals retain Warne, Watson|publisher=indian express|accessdate=2010-12-08}}</ref>
