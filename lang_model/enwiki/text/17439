'''Serotonin syndrome''' is a potentially life-threatening [[adverse drug reaction]] that may occur following therapeutic drug use, inadvertent interactions between drugs, [[overdose]] of particular drugs, or the recreational use of certain drugs. The terms '''serotonin toxicity''' or '''serotonin toxidrome''' are more accurate as they reflect the fact that it is a form of [[poison]]ing.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Gillman P | title = Comment on: Serotonin syndrome due to co-administration of linezolid and venlafaxine. | journal = J Antimicrob Chemother | volume = 54 | issue = 4 | pages = 844<U+2013>5 | year = 2004 | doi=  10.1093/jac/dkh404 | pmid = 15317745}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Gillman PK |title=A review of serotonin toxicity data: implications for the mechanisms of antidepressant drug action |journal=Biol.

Serotonin syndrome is a consequence of excess serotonergic activity at [[central nervous system]] (CNS) and peripheral [[5-HT receptor|serotonin receptors]]. This excess serotonin activity produces a spectrum of specific symptoms including [[cognitive]], [[Autonomic nervous system|autonomic]], and [[Somatic nervous system|somatic effects]]. The symptoms may range from barely perceptible to fatal.<ref name="Boyer-NEJM">{{cite journal |author=Boyer EW, Shannon M |title=The serotonin syndrome |journal=N. Engl. J. Med. |volume=352 |issue=11 |pages=1112<U+2013>20 |year=2005 |pmid=15784664 |doi=10.1056/NEJMra041867}}</ref> Numerous drugs and drug combinations have been reported to produce serotonin syndrome.

Diagnosis of serotonin syndrome includes observing the symptoms produced and a thorough investigation of the patient's history. The syndrome has a characteristic picture but can be mistaken for other illneses in some patients, particularly those with [[neuroleptic malignant syndrome]]. Treatment consists of discontinuing medications which may contribute and in moderate to severe cases administering a serotonin [[Antagonist (medical)|antagonist]]. An important adjunct treatment includes controlling agitation with [[benzodiazepine]] sedation. The high profile case of [[Libby Zion]], who died from serotonin syndrome,<ref name="Boyer-NEJM"/> resulted in changes to graduate medical education in New York State.<ref name="pmid9757752"/>

==Signs and symptoms==

Symptom onset is usually rapid, often occurring within minutes. Serotonin syndrome encompasses a wide range of clinical findings. Mild symptoms may only consist of [[tachycardia|increased heart rate]], shivering, [[diaphoresis|sweating]], [[mydriasis|dilated pupils]], [[myoclonus]] (intermittent tremor or twitching), as well as [[hyperreflexia|overresponsive reflexes]].<ref name="Boyer-NEJM"/> Moderate intoxication includes additional abnormalities such as hyperactive bowel sounds, [[hypertension|high blood pressure]] and [[hyperthermia]]; a temperature as high as {{convert|40|<U+00B0>C|<U+00B0>F}} is common in moderate intoxication. The overactive reflexes and [[clonus]] in moderate cases may be greater in the lower limbs than in the [[upper limb]]s. Mental status changes include [[hypervigilance]] and [[Agitation (emotion)|agitation]].<ref name="Boyer-NEJM"/> Severe symptoms include severe increases in heart rate and blood pressure that may lead to shock. Severe cases often have agitated [[delirium]] as well as muscular rigidity and high muscular tension. Temperature may rise to above {{convert|41.1|<U+00B0>C|<U+00B0>F}} in life-threatening cases. Other abnormalities include [[metabolic acidosis]], [[rhabdomyolysis]], [[seizures]], [[renal failure]], and [[disseminated intravascular coagulation]]; these effects usually arise as a consequence of hyperthermia.<ref name="Boyer-NEJM"/><ref name="Isbister Buckley"/>

The symptoms are often described as a clinical triad of abnormalities:<ref name="Boyer-NEJM"/><ref name="Dunkley"/>

*'''[[Cognitive|Cognitive effects]]''': [[mental confusion]], [[hypomania]], [[hallucinations]], [[agitation (emotion)|agitation]], [[headache]], [[coma]].
*'''[[Autonomic nervous system|Autonomic effects]]''': [[shivering]], [[sweating]], [[hyperthermia]], [[hypertension]], [[tachycardia]], [[nausea]], [[diarrhea]].
*'''[[Somatic nervous system|Somatic effects]]''': [[myoclonus]] (muscle twitching), [[hyperreflexia]] (manifested by [[clonus]]), [[tremor]].

==Pathophysiology==

[[Serotonin]] is a [[neurotransmitter]] involved in multiple states including aggression, pain, sleep, appetite, anxiety, depression, migraine, and vomiting.<ref name="Dunkley"/> Serotonin excess was first noted in humans in 1960.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Oates JA, Sjoerdsma A |title=Neurologic effects of tryptophan in patients receiving a monoamine oxidase inhibitor |journal=Neurology |volume=10 |issue= |pages=1076<U+2013>8 |year=1960 |month=December |pmid=13730138 |doi= |url=}}</ref> The syndrome is caused by increased serotonin in the [[central nervous system]].<ref name="Boyer-NEJM"/> It was originally suspected that [[Agonist|agonism]] of [[5-HT receptor|5-HT1A]] receptors in [[Periaqueductal gray|central grey]] nuclei and the medulla was responsible for the development of the syndrome.<ref name="Whyte"/> Further study has determined that overstimulation of primarily the [[5-HT2A receptor]]s appears to contribute substantially to the condition.<ref name="Whyte">{{cite book |last=Whyte| first= Ian M. |chapter=Serotonin Toxicity/Syndrome|title=Medical Toxicology |publisher=Williams & Wilkins| location=Philadelphia |year=2004|pages=103&ndash;6| isbn=0-7817-2845-2}}</ref> The 5-HT1A receptor may still contribute through a [[pharmacodynamic]] interaction in which increased synaptic concentrations of a serotonin agonist saturate all receptor subtypes.<ref name="Boyer-NEJM"/> Additionally, noradrenergic CNS hyperactivity may play a role as CNS [[norepinephrine]] concentrations are increased in serotonin syndrome and levels appear to correlate with the clinical outcome. Other neurotransmitters may also play a role; [[NMDA]] and [[Gamma-aminobutyric acid|GABA]] have been suggested as affecting the development of the syndrome.<ref name="Boyer-NEJM"/>  Serotonin toxicity is more pronounced following supra-therapeutic doses and [[overdose]]s, and they merge in a continuum with the toxic effects of overdose.<ref name="Isbister-JToxClinTox">{{cite journal | author = Isbister G, Bowe S, Dawson A, Whyte I | title = Relative toxicity of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) in overdose | journal = J Toxicol Clin Toxicol | volume = 42 | issue = 3 | pages = 277<U+2013>85 | year = 2004 | pmid = 15362595 | doi = 10.1081/CLT-120037428}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | author = Whyte I, Dawson A, Buckley N | title = Relative toxicity of venlafaxine and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors in overdose compared to tricyclic antidepressants | journal = QJM | volume = 96 | issue = 5 | pages = 369<U+2013>74 | year = 2003 | pmid = 12702786 | doi = 10.1093/qjmed/hcg062}}</ref>

===Spectrum concept===
A postulated <U+2018>spectrum concept<U+2019> of serotonin toxicity emphasises the role that progressively increasing serotonin levels play in mediating the clinical picture as side effects merge into toxicity. The dose-effect relationship is the term used to describe the effects of progressive elevation of serotonin, either by raising the dose of one drug, or combining it with another serotonergic drug which may produce large elevations in serotonin levels.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Gillman PK |title=The spectrum concept of serotonin toxicity |journal=Pain Med |volume=5 |issue=2 |pages=231<U+2013>2 |year=2004 |month=June |pmid=15209988 |doi=10.1111/j.1526-4637.2004.04033.x}}</ref>

==Risk and severity==

The relative risk and severity of serotonergic side effects and serotonin toxicity, with individual drugs and combinations, is complex. Serotonin syndrome has been reported in in patients of all ages, including the elderly, children, and newborn infants.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Laine K, Heikkinen T, Ekblad U, Kero P |title=Effects of exposure to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors during pregnancy on serotonergic symptoms in newborns and cord blood monoamine and prolactin concentrations |journal=Arch.

==Diagnosis==

There is no laboratory test for serotonin syndrome, therefore diagnosis is by symptom observation and investigation of the patient's history. The most important symptoms for diagnosing serotonin syndrome are tremor, [[akathisia]], or [[clonus]] (spontaneous, inducible and ocular).<ref name="Dunkley"/> [[Physical examination]] of the patient should include assessment of [[Tendon reflex|deep-tendon reflexes]] and muscle rigidity,  the dryness of the [[Mucous membrane|oral mucosa]], the size and reactivity of the pupils, the intensity of bowel sounds, skin color, and the presence or absence of sweating.<ref name="Boyer-NEJM"/> The patient's history also plays an important role in diagnosis, investigations should include enquries about the use of prescription and [[over-the-counter]] drugs, illicit substances, and [[dietary supplement]]s, as all these agents have been implicated in the development of serotonin syndrome.<ref name="Boyer-NEJM"/> Researchers in Australia have developed the Hunter Serotonin Toxicity Criteria for diagnosing serotonin syndrome.<ref name="Dunkley"/> 

The Hunter Serotonin Toxicity Criteria suggests serotonin syndrome if the patient has taken a serotonergic agent and has symptoms of:<ref name="Dunkley"/>
* Spontaneous clonus, or
* Inducible clonus or ocular clonus with agitation or diaphoresis, or
* Tremor and hyperreflexia, or
* Hypertonism and temperature > {{convert|38|<U+00B0>C|<U+00B0>F}} and ocular clonus or inducible clonus

===Differential diagnosis===

Serotonin toxicity has a characteristic picture which is generally hard to confuse with other [[medical conditions]], but in some situations it may go unrecognized because it may be mistaken for a [[virus| viral illness]], [[anxiety]], [[neurological disorder]], [[anticholinergic]]
poisoning, [[sympathomimetic]] toxicity, or worsening psychiatric condition.<ref name="Isbister Buckley"/><ref name="Boyer-NEJM"/><ref>{{cite journal | author = Fennell J, Hussain M | title = Serotonin syndrome:case report and current concepts. | journal = Ir Med J | volume = 98 | issue = 5 | pages = 143<U+2013>4 | year = 2005 | pmid = 16010782}}</ref> The condition most often confused with serotonin syndrome is [[neuroleptic malignant syndrome]] (NMS).<ref>{{cite journal |author=Nisijima K, Shioda K, Iwamura T |title=Neuroleptic malignant syndrome and serotonin syndrome |journal=Prog. Brain Res. |volume=162 |issue= |pages=81<U+2013>104 |year=2007 |pmid=17645916 |doi=10.1016/S0079-6123(06)62006-2 |url=}}</ref> The clinical features of neuroleptic malignant syndrome and serotonin syndrome share some features which can make differentiating them difficult.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Christensen V, Glenth<U+00F8>j B | title = [Malignant neuroleptic syndrome or serotonergic syndrome] | journal = Ugeskr Laeger | volume = 163 | issue = 3 | pages = 301<U+2013>2 | year = 2001 | pmid = 11219110}}</ref> In both conditions, [[Autonomic nervous system|autonomic]] dysfunction and altered [[mental status]] develop.<ref name="Whyte"/> However, they are actually very different conditions with different underlying dysfunction (serotonin excess vs [[dopamine]] blockade). Both the time course and the clinical features of NMS differ significantly from those of serotonin toxicity.<ref name="Dunkley"/> Serotonin toxicity has a rapid onset after the administration of a serotonergic drug and responds to serotonin blockade such as drugs like [[chlorpromazine]] and [[cyproheptadine]]. [[Dopamine receptor]] blockade (NMS) has a slow onset and typically evolves over several days after administration of a [[neuroleptic]] drug and responds to dopamine agonists such as [[bromocriptine]].<ref name="Boyer-NEJM"/><ref name="Whyte"/>

[[Differential diagnosis]] may become difficult in patients recently exposed to both serotonergic drugs and neuroleptic drugs. Features that are classically present in NMS, that are useful for differentiating the two, are [[bradykinesia]] and [[extrapyramidal]] "lead pipe" rigidity, whereas serotonin syndrome causes [[hyperkinesia]] and [[clonus]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Isbister GK, Dawson A, Whyte IM |title=Citalopram overdose, serotonin toxicity, or neuroleptic malignant syndrome? |journal=Can J Psychiatry |volume=46 |issue=7 |pages=657<U+2013>9 |year=2001 |month=September |pmid=11582830 |doi= |url=}}</ref><ref name="Birmes">{{cite journal |author=Birmes P, Coppin D, Schmitt L, Lauque D |title=Serotonin syndrome: a brief review |journal=CMAJ |volume=168 |issue=11 |pages=1439<U+2013>42 |year=2003 |month=May |pmid=12771076 |pmc=155963 |doi= |url=http://www.cmaj.ca/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=12771076}}</ref>

==Management==

There is no antidote to the condition itself, and management involves the removal of the precipitating drugs and the initiation of supportive care. Supportive care includes the control of agitation, the administration of serotonin [[Receptor antagonist|antagonists]] ([[cyproheptadine]] or [[methysergide]]), the control of [[Autonomic Nervous System|autonomic]] instability, and the control of hyperthermia.<ref name="Boyer-NEJM"/><ref>{{cite journal | author = Sporer K | title = The serotonin syndrome. Implicated drugs, pathophysiology and management | journal = Drug Saf | volume = 13 | issue = 2 | pages = 94<U+2013>104 | year = 1995 | pmid = 7576268}}</ref> The intensity of therapy depends on the severity of symptoms. If the symptoms are mild, treatment may only consist of discontinuation of the offending medication or medications, offering supportive measures, giving [[benzodiazepine]]s for myoclonus, and waiting for the symptoms to resolve. Moderate cases should have all thermal and cardiorespiratory abnormalities corrected and can benefit from serotonin antagonists. Critically ill patients should receive the above therapies as well as sedation or neuromuscular paralysis.<ref name="Boyer-NEJM"/>

Specific treatment for some symptoms may be required. One of the most important treatments is the control of agitation with benzodiazepines.<ref name="Boyer-NEJM"/> Patient who have low [[blood pressure]] require treatment with direct-acting [[sympathomimetic]]s such as [[epinephrine]], [[norepinephrine]], or [[phenylephrine]]. Conversely, hypertension or tachycardia can be treated with short-acting [[antihypertensive]] drugs such as [[nitroprusside]] or [[esmolol]]; longer acting drugs such as [[propranolol]] should be avoided as they may lead to hypotension and [[Shock (circulatory)|shock]].<ref name="Boyer-NEJM"/> Treatment for hyperthermia includes reducing muscle over-activity with benzodiazepine sedation.

==Epidemiology ==
Epidemiological studies of serotonin syndrome are difficult as many physicians are unaware of the diagnosis or the physician may miss the

==Notable cases==
The most widely recognized example of serotonin syndrome was the death of [[Libby Zion]] in 1984.<ref>{{cite news |first=Jane |last=Brody  |authorlink=Jane Brody |coauthors= |title=A Mix of Medicines That Can Be Lethal  |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2007/02/27/health/27brody.html?n=Top/News/Health/Diseases,%20Conditions,%20and%20Health%20Topics/Antidepressants |quote=The death of Libby Zion, an 18-year-old college student, in a New York hospital on March 5, 1984, led to a highly publicized court battle and created a cause c<U+00E9>l<U+00E8>bre over the lack of supervision of inexperienced and overworked young doctors. But only much later did experts zero in on the preventable disorder that apparently led to Ms. Zion<U+2019>s death: a form of drug poisoning called serotonin syndrome. |work=[[New York Times]] |date=February 27, 2007 |accessdate=2009-02-13 }}</ref> Libby was freshman at [[Bennington College]] at her death on March 5, 1984, at age 18. She died within 8 hours of her emergency admission to the [[New York-Presbyterian Hospital|New York Hospital Cornell Medical Center]]. She had an ongoing history of depression, and came to the Manhattan hospital on the evening of March 4, 1984, with a fever, agitation and "strange jerking motions" of her body. She also seemed disoriented at times. The emergency room physicians were unable to diagnose her condition definitively, but admitted her for hydration and observation. Her death was caused by a combination of [[pethidine]] and [[phenelzine]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Asch DA, Parker RM |title=The Libby Zion case.
