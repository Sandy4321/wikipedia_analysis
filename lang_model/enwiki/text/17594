'''Jo Elizabeth Stafford''' (November 12, 1917&nbsp;<U+2013> July 16, 2008<ref name=Boston/>) was an [[United States|American]] singer of [[traditional pop music]] and [[jazz standards]] and occasional actress whose career ran from the late 1930s to the early 1960s. Stafford was greatly admired for the purity of her [[human voice|voice]] and was considered one of the most versatile vocalists of the era.<!--See Talk page concerning removed perfect pitch claim.-->{{#tag:ref| Stafford had a reputation for [[absolute pitch|perfect pitch]], but she dismissed this, claiming only to be a careful singer with good [[relative pitch]].<ref name="Interview">Interview by [[Michael Feinstein]], Bonus Tracks on {{cite video

==Early years==
[[File:Stafford sisters 1941.JPG|thumb|left|180px|The singing Stafford Sisters in 1941.]]

Stafford was born in [[Coalinga, California]] in 1917 to Grover Cleveland Stafford and Anna York Stafford, a second cousin of [[World War I]] hero [[Alvin C. York|Sergeant Alvin York]]; both parents enjoyed singing and sharing music with their family.<ref name=Sherbrooke/> Her father had hopes of being a success in the California oil fields when he moved his family from [[Gainesboro, Tennessee]]; what he found instead was a succession of various jobs.  When he worked for a private girls' school, Grover was allowed to bring the school's phonograph home on Christmas.  Stafford remembered hearing "Whispering Hope" on it as a small child.  Her mother was an accomplished [[banjo]] player, playing and singing many of the folk songs which would become an influence on her daughter's later career.<ref name=Telegraph>{{cite web|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/2419478/Jo-Stafford.html|title=Jo Stafford|publisher=The Telegraph|date=17 July 2008|accessdate=28 January 2011}}</ref>

Stafford's first public singing appearance came in Long Beach, where the family lived when she was 12. She sang "Believe Me If All Those Endearing Young Charms", a Stafford family sentimental favorite.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=o2pFAAAAIBAJ&sjid=SrwMAAAAIBAJ&pg=7354,684630&dq=jo+stafford&hl=en|title=The Marquee|author=Kleiner, Dick|date=5 August 1954|publisher=The Telegraph-Herald|accessdate=12 March 2011}}</ref> Her second was far more dramatic.  A student at [[Long Beach Polytechnic High School]] with the lead in the school musical, she was on stage rehearsing when a 1933 [[Long Beach earthquake|earthquake]] hit, destroying the school.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=MGEqAAAAIBAJ&sjid=AU8EAAAAIBAJ&pg=7674,1278242&dq=jo+stafford&hl=en|title=Jo Stafford Easy Talker|author=Leonard, Vince|date=19 March 1964|publisher=The Pittsburgh Press|accessdate=9 January 2011}}</ref> Originally, she wanted to become an [[opera]] singer and studied voice as a child. However, because of the [[Great Depression]], she abandoned that idea and joined her sisters Christine and Pauline in a [[popular music|popular]] [[vocal group]], "The Stafford Sisters", which performed on [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]] [[radio]] station [[KHJ (AM)|KHJ]].<ref name=Obit>{{cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=skAqAAAAIBAJ&sjid=XEwEAAAAIBAJ&pg=6996,3911159&dq=red+ingle&hl=en|title=Jo Stafford, singer known as 'GI Jo'|date=19 July 2008|publisher=The Press Democrat|accessdate=9 January 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.parabrisas.com/d_staffordj.php|title=Jo Stafford|publisher=Parabrisas.com}}</ref> The sisters got their start on [[KNX (AM)|KNX]] as part of ''The Singing Crockett Family of Kentucky'' program when Jo was 18.<ref name=Sherbrooke/><ref name=Telegraph/>

She claimed that her arrangement had to be adapted as Astaire had difficulty with some of the syncopation, in her words: "The man with the syncopated shoes couldn't do the syncopated notes".<ref name="Interview"/>

==The Pied Pipers==
[[File:Pied pipers stafford.JPG|thumb||200px|Photo of Stafford when she was with the Pied Pipers.]]
By 1938, they were involved in the [[Twentieth Century Fox]] production of ''Alexander's Ragtime Band''.  The studio brought in many vocal groups to work on the film, among them were The Four Esquires, The Rhythm Kings and [[The King Sisters]]. With plenty of time between takes, the various groups sang and socialized while waiting to be called to the set.  It soon worked out that The Four Esquires and The Rhythm Kings became a new vocal group, [[The Pied Pipers]], which Stafford joined.<ref name=Telegraph/><ref name="Ber2008"/> This group consisted of eight members including Stafford: John Huddleston (who was Stafford's husband from 1941 until their divorce in 1943),<ref name="Obit">{{cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=qMM0AAAAIBAJ&sjid=XyEGAAAAIBAJ&pg=5356,1502720&dq=perry+como+person+to+person&hl=en|title=Singer Jo Stafford dies of heart failure at age 90|date=18 July 2008|publisher=Lodi News-Sentinel|accessdate=19 November 2010}}</ref> Hal Hooper, Chuck Lowry, Bud Hervey, George Tait, Woody Newbury, and [[Dick Whittinghill]]. As the Pied Pipers, they worked on local [[radio]] and [[film|movie]] [[soundtrack]]s.<ref>{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=5B8EAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA165&lpg=PA165&dq=beat+the+band+como&source=bl&ots=sIcIGGPtzc&sig=BYRgwK53GCT5dyzHoT1929kE0mk&hl=en&ei=jJ4FTaPjA8GVnwfwk-3lDQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=7&ved=0CDoQ6AEwBjgU#v=onepage&q=beat%20the%20band%20como&f=false|title=Pied Pipers Ad|page=56|year=1943|publisher=Billboard|accessdate=12 December 2010}}</ref> When Alyce and Yvonne King had a party for their boyfriends' visit to Los Angeles, the Pied Pipers were invited, speedily eating all of the party's food. The King Sisters' boyfriends were [[Tommy Dorsey]]'s [[arrangement|arrangers]] [[Axel Stordahl]] and [[Paul Weston]], who became interested in the group after meeting them there.<ref name=Telegraph/>

After Weston persuaded Dorsey to audition the group in 1938, the eight drove cross-country to [[New York, New York|New York]] together for the chance.<ref name=Telegraph/> Dorsey liked them enough to sign them for ten weeks, but after the second broadcast the sponsor heard them and disliked them, firing the group.<ref name=Hall/> They stayed in New York for several months,<ref name=Telegraph/> but landed only a single job that paid them just $3.60 each, though they did record four sides for [[RCA|RCA Victor Records]]. Paul Weston later said that he and Axel Stordahl felt a type of responsibility for the group, since it was Weston who had made the arrangements for their audition with Tommy Dorsey. The two men also felt some embarrassment when running into the Pied Pipers in New York because of this and also because they both were still employed by Dorsey, so they tried avoiding the group.<ref name=Hall/>

The Pied Pipers returned to Los Angeles.  Soon after getting home, Stafford received a phone call from Dorsey, saying he could use the group, but four members of it only. Half of the group, including their only female vocalist, arrived in Chicago in 1939; this led to success, especially for Stafford, who was also featured in solo performances.<ref name=Telegraph/><ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=p_ZJAAAAIBAJ&sjid=HoUMAAAAIBAJ&pg=2457,3130948&dq=elmo+tanner&hl=en|title=Announcer remembers top bands of the past|date=5 November 1987|author=Roberts.

In 1942, the group had an argument with Dorsey and left. By this time, it was successful enough in its own right; The Pied Pipers appeared on the radio shows of Sinatra, [[Bob Crosby]] and Johnny Mercer.  It became one of the first groups signed to [[Johnny Mercer]]'s new label, [[Capitol Records]].<ref name="Obit"/><ref name="Ber2008"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,803776,00.html|title=Girlish Voice|date=1 July 1946|publisher=Time|accessdate=28 June 2010}}</ref> Paul Weston was Capitol's music director; he had left Tommy Dorsey's band to work with [[Dinah Shore]] shortly after Dorsey re-hired the smaller version of the Pied Pipers.<ref name=Telegraph/><ref name=Music>{{cite web|url=http://www.bigbandlibrary.com/paulweston.html|title=Paul Weston|date=December 2007|author=Popa, Christopher|publisher=Big Band Music|accessdate=3 February 2011}}</ref>

In 1944, Stafford left the Pied Pipers to go solo. Her tenure with the [[USO]], in which she gave countless performances for soldiers stationed in the US, led to her acquiring the nickname "G.I. Jo." <ref name="Obit"/><ref name=Hall/> On returning from the Pacific theater, a veteran told Stafford that the Japanese would play her records on loudspeakers in an attempt to make the US troops homesick enough to surrender; she personally replied to all letters she received from servicemen.<ref name=Boston/><ref name=Telegraph/>

Beginning in late 1945, she hosted the Tuesday and Thursday broadcasts of an [[NBC]] musical variety radio program&nbsp;&mdash; ''[[The Chesterfield Supper Club]]''.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=Ty5JAAAAIBAJ&sjid=-YMMAAAAIBAJ&pg=4368,2971749&dq=perry+como&hl=en|title=Actresses and Vocalists Star On Networks|date=9 December 1945|publisher=Youngstown Vindicator|accessdate=29 November 2010}}</ref><ref name="Chesterfield">{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=TEoEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA78&dq=perry+como&lr=&as_drrb_is=q&as_minm_is=0&as_miny_is=&as_maxm_is=0&as_maxy_is=&as_brr=3&cd=25#v=onepage&q=perry%20como&f=false |title=Full-page ad for the Chesterfield Supper Club (page 78)|date=13 January 1947|publisher=Life Magazine|accessdate=30 June 2010}}</ref> Stafford moved from New York to California in November 1946, but continued to host ''Chesterfield Supper Club'' from [[Hollywood]].<ref>{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=TEoEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA78&dq=chesterfield+supper+club&hl=en&ei=rszvTK_HJsfungfPqvWBCg&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=5&ved=0CEIQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&q=chesterfield%20supper%20club&f=false|title=Ad for 'Chesterfield Supper Club'|date=13 January 1947|publisher=Life|accessdate=26 November 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=ERoEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PT29&dq=chesterfield+supper+club&hl=en&ei=M5icTennOqi00QG-2eDbAg&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CC4Q6AEwADge#v=onepage&q=chesterfield%20supper%20club&f=false|title=Music--As Written|publisher=Billboard|date=2 November 1946|accessdate=6 April 2011}}</ref>  She also had her own radio show which went on the air later on Tuesday nights when she joined the "Supper Club".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=Ty5JAAAAIBAJ&sjid=-YMMAAAAIBAJ&pg=4368,2971749&dq=perry+como&hl=en|title=Actresses and Vocalists Star on Networks|date=9 December 1945|publisher=Youngstown Vindicator|accessdate=30 October 2010}}</ref> In 1948, she cut her "Supper Club" appearances to once a week (Tuesdays), with [[Peggy Lee]] becoming the host of the Thursday broadcasts.<ref>{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=EwtRbXNca0oC&pg=PA152&lpg=PA152&dq=chesterfield+supper+club&source=bl&ots=H4zKbUA0Br&sig=chyBsPTHW5ciO5txTs69pFS9OLk&hl=en&ei=Rj8pTNnOIJWknQfwu9SLAQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=10&ved=0CC8Q6AEwCTgU#v=onepage&q=chesterfield%20supper%20club&f=false|title=On the air: the encyclopedia of old time radio|editor-last=Dunning|editor-first=John|year=1998|pages=840|publisher=Oxford University Press USA|isbn=0195076788|accessdate=30 June 2010}}</ref> During her time with ''Chesterfield Supper Club'', she remembered and revisited some of the folk music she had heard and enjoyed as a child.

With the rediscovery of the folk tunes came an interest in folklore; Stafford established a prize which was awarded to the best collection of American folklore submitted by a college student.  The awards were handled by the [[American Folklore Society]].<ref name=Sherbrooke>{{cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=T7VNAAAAIBAJ&sjid=VkQDAAAAIBAJ&pg=1860,7232176&dq=jo+stafford&hl=en|title=Jo Stafford of CBS 'Club 15'|date=23 February 1950|publisher=The Sherbrooke Telegram|accessdate=9 January 2011}}</ref>

In 1948 Stafford and [[Gordon MacRae]] had a million-seller with their version of "Say Something Sweet to Your Sweetheart" and in 1949 repeated their success with "My Happiness". Stafford also recorded the "Whispering Hope" of her childhood memories with MacRae in the same year.<ref name=Telegraph/> Stafford began hosting a weekly [[Radio Luxembourg (English)|Radio Luxembourg]] radio program in 1950, recording the voice portions of the shows in Hollywood.

''[[Collier's Weekly|Collier's]]'' magazine published an article about the program in its April 21, 1951 issue entitled: ''Jo Stafford: Her Songs Upset Joe Stalin''; this earned Stafford the wrath of the Communist newspaper, the ''[[Daily Worker]]''.

In the 1950s, she had a string of popular hits with [[Frankie Laine]], six of which charted; their duet of  [[Hank Williams]]' "[[Hey Good Lookin' (song)|Hey Good Lookin']]" making the top ten in 1951.

In 1960, Stafford related there were good and bad points to working closely with her husband. She said that Weston's knowing her so well made it easy for him to arrange music for her, but that it also made it difficult at times, as Weston knew her abilities and would either write or arrange music that was elaborate because he was aware she was capable of performing the song ably. She also said she did not believe she could perform in Broadway musicals as, she believed her voice was not powerful enough for stage work.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=QBYpAAAAIBAJ&sjid=L9cEAAAAIBAJ&pg=2710,5198621&dq=paul+weston&hl=en|title=Hubby Writes It And Jo Warbles|author=Kleiner, Dick|date=26 November 1960|publisher=The Southeast Missourian|accessdate=12 March 2011}}</ref>

She recorded a mock hillbilly version of ''[[Temptation (1933 song)|Temptation]],'' which she pronounced "Tim-tayshun", in 1947.<ref name=Obit/><ref name=Billboard>{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=xgwEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PT30&dq=red+ingle&hl=en&ei=YzkCTs27KYLY0QGcx9TEDg&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=4&ved=0CEIQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&q=red%20ingle&f=false|title=First Annual Jockey Poll|date=2 August 1947|publisher=Billboard|accessdate=22 June 2011}}</ref>  That was not planned - she met Red Ingle at a recording studio and he told her that his female vocalist had been unable to make the session.    She asked if she could help and although Ingle told her it wasn't her sort of thing, she stood in and in a completely impromptu performance, was brilliantly funny, a remarkable example of how a true singer could adapt to any theme and style.

Throughout the 1950s, Stafford and Paul Weston would entertain guests at parties by putting on a skit in which they assumed the identities of a bad lounge act.<ref name=Hall>{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=mbO19W7pE-IC&pg=PA52&dq=jonathan+darlene+edwards&hl=en&ei=Mya8TerCLNLAtgfG2ezBBQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=4&ved=0CFgQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&q=jonathan%20darlene%20edwards&f=false|title=Dialogues in swing:intimate conversations with the stars of the big band era|editor-last=Hall|editor-first=Fred|year=1989|publisher=Pathfinder Publishing of California|page=52|isbn=0934793190|accessdate=4 May 2011}}</ref> Stafford would sing off-key in a high pitched voice; Weston played an untuned piano off key and with bizarre rhythms.<ref name=Obit/> It was Paul who innocently began the act at a Columbia Records sales convention, "filling time" with his impression of a dreadful lounge pianist. His audience was very appreciative and continued to ask for more even after the convention was over.<ref name=Telegraph/><ref name=Hands>{{cite web|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,893722,00.html|title=Music:Two Right Hands|date=23 September 1957|publisher=Time|accessdate=28 January 2011}}</ref> Columbia Records executive George Avakian gave the character Weston played the name of Jonathan Edwards, a [[Jonathan Edwards (theologian)|Calvinist preacher]], and asked him to record an album under this alias.  As Weston thought, he worried that he might not be able to come up with enough material for an entire album alone.<ref name=Hall/>  He asked his wife to join the project and Stafford then became Darlene Edwards, the off-key vocalist.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.anb.org/articles/18/18-03562-print.html|title=American National Biography: Paul Weston|author=Moore, James Ross|year=2001|accessdate=30 April 2011}}</ref><ref name=Jo>{{cite book|url=http://bellsouthpwp.net/h/o/holaday/JosPage/jobyglee.htm|title=Singers and the Song: G.I.

Finding that she had time left over following a 1957 recording session, Stafford, as a gag, recorded a track as Darlene Edwards. Those who heard [[bootleg recording|bootleg]]s of the recording responded positively, and later that year, Stafford and Weston recorded an entire album of songs as Jonathan and Darlene, entitled ''Jo Stafford and Paul Weston Present: The Original Piano Artistry of Jonathan Edwards, Vocals by Darlene Edwards.''  As a publicity stunt, Stafford and Weston claimed that the Edwardses were a [[New Jersey]] lounge act that they had discovered, and denied any personal connection. 
[[File:Shower of stars 1958 Benny Stafford Sands.JPG|thumb|Photo of Jo Stafford from ''Shower of Stars'' where she appeared as Darlene Edwards.  Also pictured are Jack Benny and singer [[Tommy Sands]].]]

The ruse triggered a national sensation as the public tried to identify the brazenly off-key singer and the piano player of dubious ability. (Some guessed [[Margaret Truman|Margaret]] and [[Harry Truman]], Time magazine noted.)<ref name="Ber2008"/><ref name=Hands/> The 1957 ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' article exposed that they were in fact the Edwardses.<ref name=Hall/><ref name=Hands/> The album was followed up with a "pop standards" album, on which the pair intentionally butchered popular music. 

The album was a commercial and critical success and proved to be the first commercially successful musical [[parody music|parody]] album, laying the groundwork for the careers of later "full time" musical parodists such as [[Mrs. Miller]] (famous for her off-key rendition of then-popular songs on her ''Mrs. Miller's Greatest Hits'' album, along with [["Weird Al" Yankovic]]. 

In 1958, the Westons brought the pair to the television screen for a [[Jack Benny]] ''[[Shower of Stars]]'' and to ''[[The Garry Moore Show]]'' in 1960.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=WolaAAAAIBAJ&sjid=DkoDAAAAIBAJ&pg=7067,1606554&dq=paul+weston&hl=en|title=Shower of Stars newspaper ad|date=9 January 1958|publisher=The Deseret News|accessdate=28 January 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0700148/|title=Shower of Stars Episode #4.4|date=9 January 1958|publisher=IMDB|accessdate=7 September 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=dsMxAAAAIBAJ&sjid=buUFAAAAIBAJ&pg=3849,813600&dq=jonathan+darlene+edwards&hl=en|title=TV Previews|date=11 October 1960|publisher=Lawrence Journal-World|accessdate=30 April 2011}}</ref>

They continued recording Jonathan and Darlene albums, with their 1960 album, ''[[Jonathan and Darlene Edwards in Paris]]'' winning that year's Grammy Award for Best Comedy Album (they "tied" with [[Bob Newhart]], as the Grammys decided, in a rare move, to issue two comedy awards that year. Newhart was given an award for "Spoken Word Comedy.") It was the only major award that Stafford ever won.<ref name="Ber2008"/><ref name=Hall/>

The couple continued to release the albums for several years, and in 1979 released a cover of [[The Bee Gees]]' "[[Stayin' Alive]]" backed with "[[I Am Woman]]."<ref name=Obit/> The same year also saw a brief resurgence in the popularity of Jonathan and Darlene albums when their cover of "[[Carioca (dance)|Carioca]]" was featured as the opening and closing theme to ''[[The Kentucky Fried Movie]]''.

==Personal life and retirement==

Saying she no longer found it "fun", Stafford went into semi-[[retirement]] in the mid 1960s,<ref name="Ber2008"/> retiring completely from the music business in 1975. Except for the Jonathan and Darlene Edwards material and a recording of her favorite "Whispering Hope" with her daughter Amy, also a singer, Stafford did not perform again until 1990, at a ceremony honoring Frank Sinatra.<ref name=Telegraph/><ref name=Sun/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/obituaries/article4359094.ece#cid=OTC-RSS&attr=1972202|title=Jo Stafford: beguiling and versatile jazz singer|publisher=Times Online|date=19 July 2008}}</ref> The Westons then devoted more of their time to a charity that aids those with developmental disabilities; the couple had been active in the organization for many years.<ref name="Ber2008"/><ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=bLRGAAAAIBAJ&sjid=bXsMAAAAIBAJ&pg=4682,1102376&dq=paul+weston&hl=en|title=Stars Donate Service, Money For Handicapped Children|author=Bacon, James|date=10 May 1958|publisher=Warsaw Times|accessdate=18 January 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.abilityfirst.org/locations/work_center_woodlandhills.aspx|title=Paul Weston Work Center, Woodland Hills|publisher=AbilityFirst|accessdate=28 January 2011}}</ref>  [[Concord Records]] attempted to get Stafford to change her mind and come out of retirement, but she remained adamant.<ref name=Telegraph/>

Stafford won a breach-of-contract lawsuit against her former [[record label]] in the early 1990s, which won her the rights to all of her old recordings, including the Jonathan and Darlene recordings. Following the lawsuit, Stafford, along with son Tim, reactivated the [[Corinthian Records]] label, which began life as a religious label, that the devout Paul Weston had started. With Paul Weston's help, she compiled a pair of ''Best of Jonathan and Darlene'' albums, which were released in 1993.

==Death==
In 1996, Paul Weston died of natural causes.<ref name=Obit/> Stafford continued to operate Corinthian Records. In 2006, she donated her library and her husband's to the [[University of Arizona]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://web.cfa.arizona.edu/westonstafford/ |title=Paul Weston and Jo Stafford archive at the University of Arizona}}</ref> Stafford was inducted into the Big Band Academy of America's "Golden Bandstand" in April 2007.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bigbandlibrary.com/bigbandnewsapril2007.html|title=Big Band News|date=April 2007|author=Popa, Christopher|publisher=Big Band Library|accessdate=1 April 2011}}</ref>
