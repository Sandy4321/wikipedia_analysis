The '''conquest of the Canary Islands''' by the [[Kingdom of Castille]] took place between 1402 and 1496.  It can be divided into two periods, the '''Conquista se<U+00F1>orial''', carried out by Castilian nobility in exchange for a covenant of allegiance with the crown, and the '''Conquista realenga''', carried out by the Crown itself, during the reign of the ''[[Catholic Monarchs]]''.

==Introduction==
The ties between the Canaries and the Mediterranean world which had existed since antiquity were interrupted by the decline and fall of the [[Western Roman Empire]].  Although these linkages were weakened, they were not totally severed, and the Canaries' isolation was not total.  During the Middle Ages, the first reports on the Canaries come from Arabic sources, which refer to some Atlantic islands which may have been the Canaries. What does seem clear is that this knowledge of the islands did not signify the end of the cultural isolation of the native inhabitants.

Visits to the archipelago began to increase after the end of the 13th century for reasons including:

*The economic expansion of some regions of Europe, such as [[Republic of Genoa|Genoa]], [[Aragon]], the [[Kingdom of Castille]], and Portugal, and their need to establish secure routes to the Orient to obtain silk and spices, as well as to Africa to obtain gold and slaves, while avoiding the territories controlled by the Ottoman Turks in the eastern Mediterranean.

*Development of new navigation techniques ([[compass]], [[astrolabe]], [[stern rudder]], [[cog (ship)|cog]]-[[caravel]]) and the development of cartography, as well as the development of atlases, one of which, the [[Atlas Catal<U+00E1>n]] by [[Abraham de Cresques]] of [[Mallorca]], in 1375, shows the Canary Islands with their modern names.

*Ideological and political motives:  the monarchies of Southern Europe entered an expansive phase.  In the case of the Iberian royalty, their territorial expansion was spurred by the [[Reconquista]] against the Moors in Spain.  For this reason,  territorial expansion represented a reinforcement of royal power, imbued with a crusader spirit in defense of Christianity.

== Pre-Conquest ==

The first visit by a European to the Canary Islands since [[classical antiquity|antiquity]] was by [[Republic of Genoa|Genoese]] captain [[Lanceloto Malocello]] traditionally dated 1312 (but possibly a little later, between 1318<U+2013>1325).<ref>Diffie and Winius (p.25), Meli<U+00E1> (p.45)</ref>  Malocello motives were unclear - it is believed he might have been searching for traces of the [[Vandino and Ugolino Vivaldi|Vivaldi brothers]] who had disappeared off Morocco, around [[Cape Non]] back in 1291.<ref>It is believed that the Canary island of [[Alegranza]] was named after ''Allegrancia'', one of the two galleys of the Vivaldi brothers.  See P. Amat di S. Filippo (1888) "Recenti Ritrovimenti di Carte Natucihe in Parigi in Londra ed in Firenze" Bollettino della Societ<U+00E0> geografica italiana [http://books.google.com/books?id=iHJIAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA271#v=onepage&q&f=false p. 271]</ref> Malocello made landfall (possibly shipwrecked) on [[Lanzarote]] island, and remained there for nearly twenty years.  Malocello may have attempted to erect himself as a ruler among the aboriginal peoples and been eventually expelled by them. 

According to some sources, shortly after his return to Europe, in 1336, Malocello led a return expedition to the Canaries, sponsored by King [[Dinis of Portugal]].  However, the existence of this expedition has been dismissed by most modern historians, as being based on later forged documents.<ref>The case for this expedition has been principally made by Charles Verlinden (1958) "Lanzarotto Malocello et la d<U+00E9>couverte portugaise des Canaries", ''Revue Belge de philologie et d'histoire'', Vol. 36, p.1173-1209.  For a review of the dispute, see Diffie and Winius (p.25).</ref>

[[File:Map of Angelino Dulcert cropped.jpg|thumb|150px| Portolan of [[Angelino Dulcert]] (1339) showing [[Lanzarote]] island]]Evidently drawing from the information provided by Malocello, in 1339 appeared the portolan map by [[Angelino Dulcert]] of [[Kingdom of Majorca|Majorca]] showing the Canary island of [[Lanzarote]] (named ''Insula de Lanzarotus Marocelus'' and marked by a Genoese shield), as well as the island of ''Forte Vetura'' ([[Fuerteventura]]) and ''Vegi Mari'' ([[Lobos Island|Lobos]]).<ref name="Meli<U+00E1> p.45">Meli<U+00E1> (p.45)</ref> Although earlier maps had shown fantastical depictions of the "[[Fortunate Islands]]" (on the basis of their mention in [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]]), this is the first European map where the actual Canary islands make a solid appearance (although Dulcert also includes some fantastic islands himself, notably [[St. Brendan's Island|St. Brendan]], and three islands he names ''Primaria'', ''Capraria'' and ''Canaria'').<ref name="Meli<U+00E1> p.45"/>

In 1341, a three-ship expedition sponsored by King [[Afonso IV of Portugal]], set out from Lisbon, commanded by Florentine captain [[Angiolino del Tegghia de Corbizzi]] and Genoese captain [[Nicoloso da Recco]], and employing a mixed crew of Italians, Portuguese and Castilians.  Cruising the archipelago for five months, the expedition mapped thirteen islands (seven major, six minor) and surveyed the primeval aboriginal inhabitants, the '[[Guanches]]', bringing back four natives to Lisbon.<ref>The 1341 expedition is related by [[Giovanni Boccaccio]] "De Canaria et insula reliquis, ultra Ispaniam, in occeano noviter repertis" (repr. in ''Monumenta Henricina'', vol. I, [http://books.google.com/books?id=JL_IU1hpmsIC&lpg=PP1&pg=PA389#v=onepage&q&f=false p.202-06.])  See also Diffie and Winius (p.27), Meli<U+00E1> (p.45) and Fern<U+00E1>ndez-Armesto (p.155)</ref> (This expedition would become the basis of later Portuguese claims of priority on the islands.)

European interest in the Canaries picked up quickly after the 1341 mapping expedition. The descriptions of the primeval Guanches, in particular, drew the attention of European merchants, who immediately saw the prospect of new and easy [[slave]]-raiding grounds. In 1342, two [[Kingdom of Majorca|Majorcan]] expeditions, one under Francesc Duvalers, another under Domenech Gual, assembled by private merchant consortia with a commission from Roger de Robenach (representative of [[James III of Majorca]]) set out for the Canary islands. The results of these expeditions are uncertain. 

The [[Catholic Church]] was also drawn by the news. In 1344, the Castilian-French noble [[Luis de la Cerda]] (Count of Clermont and [[Admiral of France]]), then serving as a French ambassador to the papal court in [[Avignon Papacy|Avignon]], submitted a proposal to [[Pope Clement VI]], offering the Church the more palatable vision of conquering the islands and converting the native Canarians to Christianity.<ref>Viera y Clavijo, [http://books.google.com/books?id=7o42AAAAMAAJ&pg=PA268#v=onepage&q&f=false, p.268]</ref>  In November 1344, Pope Clement VI issued the bull ''Tu devonitis sinceritas'' granting the Canary islands in perpetuity to Luis de la Cerda and bestowing upon him the title of sovereign "Prince of Fortuna".  The pope followed this up with another bull, in January 1345, giving the projected Cerda-led conquest and conversion of the islands the character of a [[crusade]], granting [[indulgences]] to its participants, and papal letters were dispatched to the Iberian monarchs urging them to provide material assistance to Cerda's expedition.<ref>''Monumenta Henricina'' vol. 1 contains copies of [[Pope Clement VI]]'s bull ''Tu devonitis sinceritas''(Nov 1344) granting the Canaries to Luis de la Cerda ([http://books.google.com/books?id=JL_IU1hpmsIC&lpg=PP1&pg=PA401#v=onepage&q&f=false p.207]), the bull ''Prouenit ex tue'' of indulgences (Jan 1345) [http://books.google.com/books?id=JL_IU1hpmsIC&lpg=PP1&pg=PA443#v=onepage&q&f=false p.228]</ref>  The Portuguese king [[Afonso IV of Portugal|Afonso IV]] immediately lodged a protest, claiming priority of discovery, but conceded to the authority of the pope.<ref>For Alfonso IV's protest (Feb 1345), see ''MH'', v. 1,([http://books.google.com/books?id=JL_IU1hpmsIC&lpg=PP1&pg=PA447#v=onepage&q&f=false p.231])</ref> [[Alfonso XI of Castile]] also protested, claiming that, by the ancient [[Visigothic Kingdom|Visigothic]] dioceses and prior [[reconquista]] treaties, the islands fell within the Castilian jurisdiction and 'sphere of conquest', but nonetheless recognized Cerda's title.<ref>For the reply of Alfonso XI (Mar 1345) see ''MH'', vol. 1 [http://books.google.com/books?id=JL_IU1hpmsIC&lpg=PP1&pg=PA455#v=onepage&q&f=false p.234]. See also Meli<U+00E1> (p.45).</ref>  Despite their formal concessions, preparations were stalled by the opposition of the Iberian monarchs, with the result that no expedition was mounted before Cerda's death in 1348.

With Cerda out of the picture, other parties resumed their adventures and we have notices of further expeditions by Majorcans (now annexed to [[Kingdom of Aragon|Aragon]]) to the area - [[Jaume Ferrer]] in 1346 (aiming for Senegal, but might have touched the Canaries), Arnau Roger in 1352, and a royal-sponsored expedition by Joan Mora in 1366 (with instructions to also patrol for interlopers).  These expeditions (and doubtless many other unrecorded ones, not only by Majorcans, but also likely by merchants of Seville and Lisbon) were almost wholly commercial, with the primary purpose of capturing native islanders to sell as [[slaves]] in European markets. But there was also some peaceful trade with the locals, particularly for [[orchil]] and [[dragon's blood]], which grew wildly on the islands and were much valued as [[dyes]] by the European cloth industry.

The pope did not give up on his hope of converting the natives. In 1351, Pope Clement VI endorsed an expedition by Majorcan captains Joan Doria and Jaume Segarra, with the object of bringing [[Franciscan]] missionaries, including twelve converted Canarian natives (apparently seized by previous Majorcan expeditions), to the islands.<ref>Pope Clement VI's bull ''Dum diligenter'' (15 May 1351) granting indulgences to Doria and Segarra is reproduced in''MH'', vol. 1 [http://books.google.com/books?id=JL_IU1hpmsIC&lpg=PP1&pg=PA461#v=onepage&q&f=false p.237]</ref> Whether this expedition ever set out is uncertain. Apocryphal legend relates the missionaries succeeded established an evangelizing center at [[Telde]] (on [[Gran Canaria]]), which the pope elevated to the 'Diocese of Fortuna' (although no bull to that effect has been found), until they were expelled in a native uprising in 1354.  More confidently is the bull issued in July 1369 by the Avignon [[Pope Urban V]] erecting the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Canarias|diocese of Fortuna]] and appointing Fr. Bonnant Tari as bishop, and a follow-up bull of September 1369 instructing the bishops of Barcelona and Tortosa to dispatch 10 secular and 20 regular clergy to preach to the Canarians in their native languages.<ref>Pope Urban V's bull ''Intercaetera'' erecting the bishopric was issued July 2, 1369; the bull ''Ad Hoc Semper'' instructing Barcelona & Tortosa was issued September 30, 1369.  See Diffie & Winius (p.42) and Meli<U+00E1> (p.46)</ref>  But whether this actually set out or just remained a paper project is also uncertain.  We have a more reliable record of a Majorcan expedition in 1386 carried out by 'Pauperes Heremite', sponsored by Peter IV Aragon and Pope Urban VI.  Although their exact fate is unknown, there is a later report that thirteen "Christian friars" who had been preaching in the Canaries "for seven years" were massacred in an uprising during 1391.<ref>Repoted by Gadifer de la Salle.  See Viera y Clavigo (p.276); Diffie & Winius (p.42)</ref>  At least five missionary expeditions would be sent (or at least planned) between 1352 and 1386.<ref>Fern<U+00E1>ndez-Armesto, p.158</ref>

[[File:Europe Mediterranean Catalan Atlas.jpeg|thumb|150px|[[Catalan Atlas]] (1375)]]
Geographic knowledge of the Canary islands coalesced with these expeditions.  La Gomera and El Hierro are depicted in the 1367 portolan of the brothers Domenico and Francesco Pizzigano.   The [[Catalan Atlas]] of 1375  shows the Canaries almost completely and accurately mapped (only [[La Palma]] is missing). The eleven islands are named in the Catalan Atlas (from east to west) as ''Graciosa'' ([[La Graciosa]]),''laregranza'' ([[Alegranza]]), ''rocho'' ([[Roque del Este|Roque]]), ''Insula de lanzaroto maloxelo'' ([[Lanzarote]]), ''insula de li vegi marin'' ([[Lobos Island|Lobos]]), ''forteventura'' (Fuerteventura), ''Insula de Canaria'' ([[Gran Canaria]]), ''Insula del infernio'' ([[Tenerife]]), ''insula de gomera'' ([[La Gomera]]), ''insula de lo fero'' ([[El Hierro]]).<ref>Fern<U+00E1>ndez-Armesto, p.161</ref>  The name 'tenerefiz' is first given alongside 'Infierno' in the 1385 ''[[Libro del Conoscimiento]]''.

During the 1370s, when Portugal and Castile were engaged in dynastic wars following the assassination of [[Peter I of Castile]], Portuguese and Castilian privateers were dispatched against each other, several of which made detours to the Canary islands for shelter or slave-raiding jaunts.  Ignoring the 1344 bull, [[Ferdinand I of Portugal]] granted (in 1370) the islands of Lanzarote and La Gomera to the adventurer 'Lan<U+00E7>arote  da Franquia' (believed by some to be none other than the impossibly-aged [[Lanceloto Malocello]]).<ref>Ferdinand I's grant of ''Nossa Senhora a Franca'' (Lanzarote) and ''Gomeira'' (La Gomera) (June 1370) is reproduced in ''MH'', vol.1  [http://books.google.com/books?id=JL_IU1hpmsIC&lpg=PP1&pg=PA475#v=onepage&q&f=false p.244].  The hypothesis that 'Lan<U+00E7>arote  da Franquia' was the elderly [[Lanceloto Malocello]] is principally due to Verlinden (1958). But this would make Malocello's at least a nonagenarian.  To reconcile the age, Verlinden disputes the authenticity of the 1312 expedition, claiming that Malocello was never marooned on Lanzarote 'for two decades', that Malocello's first trip to the Canaries was in fact the leading the murky Portuguese expedition of 1336.  Another hypothesized identity for Lancerote de Framqua is [[Lan<U+00E7>arote Pessanha]], [[admiral of Portugal]].</ref>  This Lanzarote made an attempt to seize the islands and is reported to have engaged in fighting with "Guanches and Castilians" there.<ref>The attempt is recorded in Ferdinand I's letter of 1376, ''MH'', vol. 1,[http://books.google.com/books?id=JL_IU1hpmsIC&lpg=PP1&pg=PA487#v=onepage&q&f=false p.250]. A later letter dated 1385 (''MH'', v.1, [http://books.google.com/books?id=JL_IU1hpmsIC&lpg=PP1&pg=PA511#v=onepage&q&f=false p.262]) notes that 'Lan<U+00E7>arote  da Franquia' died in the Canaries and his titles were inherited by his son 'Lopo Affonso da Franquia', suggesting the Portuguese claimant might have succeeded in establishing some sort of presence there.</ref>

There are several other expeditions, since determined to be apocryphal.<ref>The determination of their veracity has been exhaustively reviewed by Bonnet y Rever<U+00F3>n (1945).  See Diffie and Winius (p.42n)</ref>  Among those deemed purely legendary are:
* (1) A 1360 wildcat Catalan-Majorcan expedition of two ships, captain unknown (alleged in legend to be the same Aragonese galleys prepared for Cerda back in 1344). Upon making landfall at La Gomera or Gran Canaria, the Europeans were defeated and taken prisoner by the native Canarians. After a certain period of time living among the Canarians (possibly a few years), the native chieftains secretly decided to kill all the prisoners.  The entire crew, including the clerics (two Franciscan friars according to Abreu de Galindo, five says Viera y Clavijo), were swiftly rounded up and massacred by the Canarians.<ref>Originally reported in Abreu Galindo.  See Viera y Clavijo [http://books.google.com/books?id=7o42AAAAMAAJ&pg=PA274#v=onepage&q&f=false p.274], Jim<U+00E9>nez de la Romera, p.36</ref>
* (2) a 1372 expedition by 'Fernando de Castro' (Galician, not his [[Fernando de Castro|Portuguese namesake]]), who also made landing at La Gomera. After engaging in hostilities, Castro was defeated by the natives, but (unlike the 1360 expedition), the surviving Europeans were magnanimously spared and allowed to embark back to Iberia. Tradition claims that at the behest of the local king Amalahuige, Castro (or Oromel later) left behind his chaplain to convert his people to Christianity.<ref>Viera y Clavijo, p.277-78</ref>
* (3) the famous tale of the Biscayan privateer Mart<U+00ED>n Ruiz de Avenda<U+00F1>o, who took shelter on Lanzarote in 1377, and, during his stay, slept with the queen Fayna, wife of native king Zonzamas. This liaison produced a daughter Ico, who went on to marry the next king Guanarame and produce a son, Guardafia. After Guanarame's death, Guardafia's ascension to the throne was blocked by suspicions that his mother Ico (Avenda<U+00F1>o's daughter) was not of noble lineage, until she was put through a [[trial by ordeal]] (being smoked in hut, and survived).<ref>Story originally from Fr. Juan de Abreu Galindo. Reported in Viera y Clavijo ([http://books.google.com/books?id=7o42AAAAMAAJ&pg=PA191#v=onepage&q&f=false p.191-92]).  The story is suspect principally on account of the dates - Guardafia was an adult when he met Bethencourt in 1403, making it unlikely he could have been the grandson stemming from Avenda<U+00F1>o's visit in 1377.  The trial by ordeal involved an element of human sacrifice (frequently reported in Guanche culture): Ico was placed in a sealed hut with three common village women, and fires were set and the smoke pumped into it; the determination that she was of noble blood was assessed by the fact that the three commoners suffocated to death, whereas Ico survived.  Her survival is credited to an old woman who secretly gave her a wet sponge to place over her mouth.</ref>
* (4) A 1382 ship from Seville, commanded by Francisco Lopez, wrecked off Guinigada ([[Gran Canaria]]), with 13 survivors; they went on to live among the Canarian natives, until their deaths c.1394.<ref>Viera y Clavijo (p.276)</ref>
* (5) An expedition in 1385 by Hernan Peraza, a Sevillan with a permit from Henry III of Castile.
* (6) A 1386 expedition of two ships, under the command of Fernando de Ormel, of Galician origin, but noble in Castile and naval officer of [[John I of Castile]]. While patrolling the Andalusian coast, was caught up in a storm and ended up emerging at La Gomera.<ref>Viera y Clavijo (p.277)</ref>
* (7) A 1399 expedition of Gonzalo Peraza Martel, Lord of Almonastor (unlike the actual voyage of Almonastor in 1393).

Other legendary traditions include the apparition of the [[Virgin of Candelaria]] in 1392-93, encountered by two [[Guanches]] on the beaches of Tenerife.<ref>Viera y Clavijo, [http://books.google.com/books?id=7o42AAAAMAAJ&pg=PA281#v=onepage&q&f=false p.281]</ref>

In the 14th century, a variety of forces competed for control of the Canaries:  Genoese, Catalan-Mallorcan, Castilian, and Portuguese.  In the following century, Castile and Portugal were the primary contenders.

== The conquest==
[[File:Jean de B<U+00E9>thencourt.jpg|thumb|Jean de B<U+00E9>thencourt.]]

The conquest took place between 1402 and 1496.  It was not an easy task, militarily, given the resistance of the [[Guanches|Guanche]] aboriginals in some islands.  Nor was it easy politically, given the conflicting interests of the nobility (bent of fortifying their economic and political power) and the state, particularly [[Crown of Castile|Castile]], with an interest in reinforcing its own power in competition with the nobles.

Historians identify two distinguishable periods in the conquest of the Canaries:

* '''Conquista se<U+00F1>orial''', so called because the conquest was carried out by the [[nobility]] for their own ends and without the direct participation of the Crown. Under a pact of vassalage the Crown granted the rights to the conquest and in exchange the noblemen swore allegiance to the Crown. We can distinguish within this period two phases. The first is known as the '''Conquista Betancuriana o Normanda''' (the Bethencourt or Norman Conquest) was carried out by [[Jean de Bethencourt]] and [[Gadifer de la Salle]] between 1402 and 1405 and involved the subjugation of [[Lanzarote]], [[El Hierro]] and [[Fuerteventura]]. The second phase is known as the ''Conquista Se<U+00F1>orial castellana'' and was carried out by Castilian nobles whose appropriation of the land was mediated through purchase, cession and marriage. This phase included the land conquered in the first phase and also the island of  [[La Gomera]] and lasted until 1450.

* '''Conquista realenga'''. This term defines the conquest carried out directly by the Kingdom of Castile during the reign of the Catholic Monarchs who armed and part financed the conquest of the islands not yet subjugated: [[Gran Canaria]], [[La Palma]] and [[Tenerife]]. This conquest ended in 1496 with the defeat of Tenerife and the integration of the Canaries Archipelago into the Kingdom of Castile. The ''Conquista realenga'' took place between 1478 and 1496.

== The ''Conquista Betancuriana'' ==
The first period of the conquest of the Canaries was carried out by the Norman nobles [[Jean de Bethencourt]] and [[Gadifer de la Salle]]. Their motives were basically economic: Bethencourt possessed textile factories and dye works and the Canaries offered a source of dyes such as the [[orchil]] lichen.
[[Image:Le Canarien.jpg|thumb|right|220px|Le Canarien.]]
Bethencourt received important political support in the court of King [[Henry III of Castile]]. His uncle, Robert de Braquemont, gained the king's permission for the conquest of the Canary Islands on behalf of the Norman noble. In exchange for these rights Bethencourt became a [[vassal]] of the Castilian King. Robert de Braquemont invested a significant amount in the venture. The story of the Bethencourt Conquest was recorded in the chronicle known as the Canarien, compiled by two clerics Pierre Bontier and Jean Le Verrier. The original was adapted in two later versions, one by [[Gadifer de La Salle]] (which appears the more reliable of the two) and the other by the nephew of Bethencourt, Maciot de Bethencourt.

=== The conquest of Lanzarote ===
The Norman expedition set off from [[La Rochelle]] and stopped off in [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]] and [[C<U+00E1>diz]] before arriving in [[Lanzarote]] in the summer of 1402. The island's aborigines and their chief Guadarfia were unable to resist the invading forces and surrendered. The Normans established themselves on the south of the island where they constructed a fortress and founded the Bishopric of the Canaries. From this location they attempted an assault on [[Fuerteventura]].

=== The conquest of Fuerteventura ===
This campaign lasted between 1402 and 1405. The extended duration was not due so much to the resistance of the islanders as to the difficulties and internal divisions between the two captains leading the invaders. Hunger and a lack of resources forced the expedition to retreat to Lanzarote. Jean de Bethencourt then travelled to Castila to drum up further support. There King Enrique III supplied the necessary measures and the confirmation of Bethencourt's exclusive rights to conquer the island, thereby maginalising Gadifer.

During Bethencourt's absence Gadifer had to confront a double rebellion, one by a section of his men led by Bert<U+00ED>n de Berneval, who had restarted the capture of [[slave]]s and the other by the Lanzarote guanches who resisted this practice. Pacifying the island took until 1404 and the conquest of [[Fuerteventura]] recommenced at the end of that year. However, the two commanders acted separately, each one fortifying his own domain (the castles of Rico Roque and Valtarajal). The conquest of the island was completed in 1405 with the surrender of the native kings of the island. On an unknown date Gadifer abandoned the island and returned to France to defend his rights, but he would never return to the islands.

After the victory Bethencourt, absolute owner of the islands, returned to [[Normandy]] in search of settlers and new resources in order to continue the conquest of the rest of the islands.

=== Conquest of El Hierro ===
The conquest of [[El Hierro]] took place in 1405. There was no resistance offered by the scattered guanche population who were largely sold as slaves. The island was then repopulated with Norman and Castilian settlers.

Bethencourt remained on the islands until 1412 when he returned permanently to his lands in Normandy, leaving Maciot de Bethencourt in charge of his possessions.

== The ''Conquista Se<U+00F1>orial Castellana'' ==
The Bethencourt era ended in 1418 when Maciot sold his holdings and the rights to subjugate the remaining islands to [[Enrique P<U+00E9>rez de Guzm<U+00E1>n, 2nd Count de Niebla|Enrique P<U+00E9>rez de Guzm<U+00E1>n]]. From this point on the intervention of the King of Castile increased. Between 1418 and 1445 dominion over the islands changed hands on a number of occasions. Finally, control over the conquered islands and the right to further conquests fell to Hern<U+00E1>n Peraza The Elder and his children Guill<U+00E9>n Peraza and In<U+00E9>s Peraza. The death of Guill<U+00E9>n Peraza in the attack on La Palma has been immortalized in a moving lament. After the death of her brother In<U+00E9>s and her husband Diego Garc<U+00ED>a de Herrera became the sole rulers of the islands until 1477 when they ceded La Gomera to their son Hern<U+00E1>n Peraza The Younger and the rights to the conquest of La Palma, Gran Canaria and Tenerife to the King of Castile.

The island of La Gomera was not taken in battle but was incorporated into the Peraza-Herrera fiefdom through an agreement between Hern<U+00E1>n Peraza The Elder and some of the insular aboriginal groups who accepted the rule of the Castilian. However, there were a number of uprisings by the guanches due to outrages committed by the rulers on the native Gomeros. The last one, in 1488 caused the death of the islands ruler, Hern<U+00E1>n Peraza, whose widow, Beatriz de Bobadilla y Ossorio, had to seek the assistance of Pedro de Vera, conqueror of Gran Canaria, in order to snuff out the rebellion. The subsequent repression caused the death of two hundred rebels and many others were sold into slavery in the Spanish markets.

== The ''Conquista Realenga'' ==
The second period of the conquest of the Canaries was different from the first in a number of ways:
[[Image:FerdinandIsabellaSpain.jpg|thumb|180px|The Catholic Monarchs: Ferdinand and Isabel]]
* The Castillian-Aragon Crown commanded and armed the invading forces.
* The funding for the enterprise was the responsibility of the Crown and individuals interested in the economic exploitation of the island's rescources.
* The islands involved, [[Gran Canaria]], [[La Palma]] y [[Tenerife]], had larger populations and offered the best economic rewards.
* The guanches of the three islands, but particularly those of Gran Canaria and Tenerife, offered a clear and prolonged resistance to the conquest.

=== Conquest of Gran Canaria (1478<U+2013>1483) ===
There were three stages in the conquest of Gran Canaria:
a) '''Initial stage, June <U+2013> December 1478'''. The first expeditionary force disembarked on La Isleta on 24 June 1478. The force was commanded by [[Juan Rej<U+00F3>n]] and Dean Berm<U+00FA>dez, as representative of the Bishop of San Marcial del Rubic<U+00F3>n, Juan de Fr<U+00ED>as, who was a co-financier of the expedition. They founded Real de La Palmas near to Barranco de Guiniguada on the site of the present day [[Las Palmas de Gran Canaria]]. A few days later the first battle of the campaign took place near to Real when the islanders were defeated. This initial victory gave the Castilians control of the north east corner of the island.

b) '''Guanche resistance and Castilian divisions from the close of 1478 until 1481'''. This period is defined by aboriginal resistance in the mountainous interior, the lack of men and materials and internal disputes between the invaders. During this stage Juan Rej<U+00F3>n was dismissed on the orders of the Catholic Monarchs. His place was taken by Pedro Fern<U+00E1>ndez de Algaba who was subsequently executed by order of the deposed Rej<U+00F3>n. The naming of Pedro de Vera as the new governor of the island and the arrest of Juan Rej<U+00F3>n put an end to the in-fighting that had continued until 1481.

c) '''Suppression of the guanche resistance and conquest of the island, 1481<U+2013>83'''. [[Pedro de Vera]], now undisputed commander of the Castilian forces, resumed the conquest of the island's interior and the guanche fiefdom of G<U+00E1>ldar. He was able to do this because a large contingent of reinforcements had been sent from Gomero by Diego Garc<U+00ED>a de Herrera. The guanche leader [[Doramas]] was subsequently killed in the Battle of [[Arucas, Las Palmas|Arucas]]. The capture of Tenesor Semid<U+00E1>n, king of G<U+00E1>ldar, by [[Alonso Fern<U+00E1>ndez de Lugo]] was a decisive factor in the victory of the invaders. Tenesor Semid<U+00E1>n was sent to Castile where he was baptized with the name [[Fernando Guanarteme]] and after signing the [[Calatayud]] Pact with [[Fernando the Catholic]] he became a loyal and valuable ally of the Castilians. His actions have been interpreted in a number of ways throughout history: some think he was a traitor to the aboriginal cause; while others feel he was an able negotiator who saved many lives. On 29 April 1483 Guayarmina Semid<U+00E1>n, considered to be queen of Gran Canaria, surrendered at Ansite Fortress. On the same day Chief Benteju<U+00ED> and his shaman-advisor Fayc<U+00E1>n committed suicide by jumping off a cliff while shouting ''Atis Tirma'' (for my land).<ref name="abreu">Abreu y Galindo, J. de, Historia de la conquista de las siete islas de Canarias, en A.

=== Conquest of La Palma (1492<U+2013>93) ===
[[Alonso Fern<U+00E1>ndez de Lugo]], who played an important role in the conquest of Gran Canaria was granted the rights of conquest for La Palma and Tenerife by the Catholic Monarchs. The agreement with the Crown included a fifth of the captives and 700,000 [[maraved<U+00ED>]]s if the conquest was completed within a year.

In order to finance the enterprise Alonso Fern<U+00E1>ndez de Lugo entered into association with Juanoto Berardi and Francisco de Riberol. Each partner contributed a third of the costs and would receive the same proportion of the benefits.

The campaign was relatively easy, commencing on 29 September 1492 when the Castilians landed in [[Tazacorte]]. Alonso Fern<U+00E1>ndez de Lugo made use of agreements and pacts with the guanches which respected the rights of the chieftains giving full equality with the Castilains in order to attract them to his cause. Resistance was generally minimal, with the exception of an incident in Tigalate. However, there was more concerted resistance in the canton of Acer<U+00F3> (Caldera de Taburiente) where the chief, Tanaus<U+00FA>, was easily able to hold out as the only two access points to the area were readily defendable against the advance of the invading forces.

Seeing that the year would soon be up and fearing that he would lose the bonus of 700,000 maraved<U+00ED>es Fern<U+00E1>ndez de Lugo proposed a meeting with Tanaus<U+00FA> which was to take place in [[Los Llanos de Aridane]]. The Castilians ambushed and captured Tanaus<U+00FA> when he left the Caldera. He was then sent to Castile as a prisoner, however, he starved to death on the journey. The official date for the end of the conquest is given as 3 May 1493. Following this part of the population of Acer<U+00F3> and other cantons which had signed peace treaties were sold as slaves although the majority were integrated into the new society formed after the conquest.

=== Conquest of Tenerife (1494<U+2013>96) ===
In December 1493 Alonso Fern<U+00E1>ndez de Lugo obtained the Catholic Monarchs confirmation of his right of conquest over the island of Tenerife and in exchange for renouncing the bonus promised for the conquest of La Palma he claimed governorship of the island, although he would not receive revenue from the Quinto Real tax.

The finance for the conquest was achieved by the sale of his [[sugar]] plantations in the valley of [[Agaete]], obtained after the conquest of Gran Canaria, and by forming an association with Italian merchants who had settled in [[Seville]].
[[Image:Plano3.jpg|Division of Tenerife at the time of the conquest|thumb|260px]]
At the time of the conquest Tenerife was divided into nine [[Menceyato]]s or kingdoms which can be divided into two camps, one largely in favour of the Castilians and the other opposed to them. The former which became known in Spanish as <U+2033>el bando de paz<U+2033>, comprised the peoples of the south and east of the island (from the <U+2033>menceyatos<U+2033> of Anaga, G<U+00FC><U+00ED>mar, Abone and Adeje) who had previous contact with Castilians through the activities of the missionary Candelaria. The opposing <U+2033>bando de guerra<U+2033> was based in the <U+2033>menceyatos<U+2033> of the north: Tegueste, Tacoronte, Taoro, Icoden and Daute and maintained a fierce resistance to the invasion.

The invading force set sail from Gran Canaria in April 1494 and landed on the coast of present day [[Santa Cruz de Tenerife]]. The force comprised 2,000 foot soldiers and 200 cavalry made up of peninsular Castilians as well as soldiers from the other Canary Islands (mainly from Gomera and Gran Canary). After building a fortress they advanced towards the interior of the island. They tried to negotiate with Bencomo, the most important king in the <U+2033>bando de guerra<U+2033>, and offered peace if he accepted Christianity and submitted to the authority of the Catholic Monarchs. Bencomo rejected the conditions attached to the offer making confrontation inevitable.
[[Image:AcentejoBattle.JPG|thumb|The First Battle of Acentejo, Tenerife.]]
The first armed encounter between the two sides was the celebrated [[First Battle of Acentejo]] that took place in a ravine called the Barranco de Acentejo or Barranco de San Antonio in the present day municipality of [[La Matanza de Acentejo]]. A force of more than 2,000 men advanced towards the north of the island through the valley of Taoro. The objective was to defeat the [[Guanches]] in the centre of their heartland. The guanches ambushed the invaders who suffered a grave defeat, losing eighty percent of their forces in the battle. Alonso Fern<U+00E1>ndez de Lugo managed to escape to Gran Canaria where he organized a new force with better trained troops and greater financial resources supported by Genoese merchants and Castilian nobles. After the battle the guanches destroyed the fortress built by the Castilians.

With a better trained and armed force Alonso Fern<U+00E1>ndez de Lugo returned to Tenerife. After rebuilding the fortress at A<U+00F1>azo he advanced towards the plains of Aguere ([[San Crist<U+00F3>bal de La Laguna]]) where in November he defeated Bencomo in the [[Battle of Aguere]] as the gaunche leader committed the error of engaging the Castillian forces in battle in open ground. The use of cavalry and reinforcements provided by Fernando Guanarteme were the deciding factors in the Castillian victory. The guanches lost 1,700 men including Bencomo and his brother (or possibly stepbrother) Tinguaro. It is claimed that an epidemic had infected the population before the battle, decimating the island's population and leaving the survivors weak or ill, this is known as the "gran modorra" or the great drowsiness. However, the exact size of the epidemic and its importance in the outcome of the battle remains disputed by some historians.

In December 1495, after a long period of guerrilla warfare, pillaging and war fatigue the Castilians again advanced on the interior in the direction of Taoro, this time from the north. A force of several thousand guanches awaited them in a ravine near to the present day municipality of [[La Victoria de Acentejo]], not far from the site of the First Battle of Acentejo. The Castilian victory in the [[Second Battle of Acentejo]] brought about the collapse of aboriginal resistance and access to the Taoro Valley remained open. The battle marked the conquest of the island of Tenerife and the end of the conquest of the Canary Islands.
