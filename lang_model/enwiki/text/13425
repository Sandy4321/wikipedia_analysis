==Plot Synopsis==
{{spoilers}}
Following a [[global]] [[pandemic]] which devastates the [[World population|Earth<U+2019>s population]], Baron (Sydow), the leader of a small tribe of survivors, has established a small barricaded and fortified area among the ruins of the former New York City. Cal (Kelton), a former scientist who is a member of Baron<U+2019>s tribe, has discovered a way to create plague resistant seeds which has allowed Baron<U+2019>s people to grow edible vegetables in the hereto barren soil. Their small vegetable garden has become an oasis in the desert of the ruined city, highly desired by the packs of starving lawless plague survivors outside.
Seeking to increase the security of his people against the raiders, especially a rival gang led by Carrot (Smith), Baron decides to recruit a deadly and skilled warrior Carson (Brynner), who has put his skills on the market for hire.
While in the short term Carson<U+2019>s presence has the desired effect, the continuous daily raids against his group<U+2019>s sanctuary cause Baron to realize that their only long term chance of salvation and hope for a better life both for his people, as well as his pregnant daughter Melinda (Miles) involves leaving the wasteland of the city for a better life out in the country. Once out of the city Baron and his tribe plan and hope to use Cal<U+2019>s skills to grow food and establish a new society in a more pastoral and secure setting on a small, almost mythical island off the coast of [[North Carolina]].
Escaping from the devastated city proves more difficult than anticipated, resulting in the deaths of Baron and many of those in his band and costing Carson his hand. Carson does finally kill Carrot and most of his followers and succeeds in getting Melinda and some of the precious seeds out of the city; at the end of the film the survivors head off to establish a new colony and a better life in the rural countryside.
