The '''Philippines''' {{IPAc-en|audio=En-us-Philippines.ogg|<U+02C8>|f|<U+026A>|l|<U+0268>|p|i<U+02D0>|n|z}} ({{lang-fil|Pilipinas|}} {{IPA-tl|<U+02CC>p<U+026A>l<U+026A><U+02C8>pin<U+0250>s|}}), officially known as the '''Republic of the Philippines''' ({{lang-fil|Republika ng Pilipinas|}}), is a country in [[Southeast Asia]] in the [[western Pacific Ocean]].  To its north across the [[Luzon Strait]] lies [[Taiwan]].  West across the [[South China Sea]] sits [[Vietnam]].  The [[Sulu Sea]] to the southwest lies between the country and the island of [[Borneo]], and to the south the [[Celebes Sea]] separates it from other islands of [[Indonesia]]. It is bounded on the east by the [[Philippine Sea]].  Its location on the [[Pacific Ring of Fire]] and its tropical climate make the Philippines prone to earthquakes and typhoons but have also endowed the country with natural resources and made it one of the richest areas of biodiversity in the world.  An archipelago comprising 7,107 islands, the Philippines is categorized broadly into three main geographical divisions: [[Luzon]], [[Visayas]], and [[Mindanao]]. Its capital city is [[Manila]].

With an estimated population of about 94&nbsp;million people, the Philippines is [[List of countries by population|the world's 12th most populous country]]. An additional 11&nbsp;million [[overseas Filipino|Filipinos live overseas]].  Multiple [[Ethnic groups in the Philippines|ethnicities]] and cultures are found throughout the islands.  In prehistoric times, [[Negrito]]s were some of the archipelago's earliest inhabitants.  They were followed by [[Models of migration to the Philippines|successive waves]] of [[Austronesian peoples]] who brought with them influences from [[Malay people|Malay]], [[Hindu]], and [[Islamic]] societies.  Trade introduced [[Culture of China|Chinese]] cultural influences which remain to this day.

The arrival of [[Ferdinand Magellan]] in 1521 marked the beginning of an era of [[Spain|Spanish]] interest and eventual dominance. Manila became the Asian hub of the [[Manila galleon|Manila<U+2013>Acapulco galleon]] [[Spanish treasure fleet|fleet]].  [[Christianity]] was widely adopted.  As the 19th&nbsp;century gave way to the 20th, there followed in quick succession the [[Philippine Revolution]] which spawned the short-lived [[First Philippine Republic]], the [[Spanish-American War]], and the [[Philippine<U+2013>American War]]. In the aftermath, the [[United States]] emerged as the dominant power. Aside from the period of [[Japanese occupation of the Philippines|Japanese occupation]], the United States retained sovereignty over the islands until the end of [[World War II]] when the Philippines gained [[Philippine independence|independence]]. The United States bequeathed to the Philippines the English language and a stronger affinity for Western culture. Since independence the Philippines has had an often tumultuous experience with [[democracy]], with popular "[[People power|People Power]]" movements overthrowing a [[History of the Philippines (1965<U+2013>1986)#Martial Law (1972<U+2013>1981)|dictatorship]] in one instance but also underlining the institutional weaknesses of its [[constitutional republic]] in [[EDSA II#Criticism|others]].

==Etymology==<!--linked-->
{{Main|Name of the Philippines}}

The name ''Philippines'' is derived from that of [[Philip II of Spain|King Philip&nbsp;II of Spain]].  Spanish explorer [[Ruy L<U+00F3>pez de Villalobos]] during his expedition in 1542 named the islands of [[Leyte]] and [[Samar]] ''Felipinas'' after the then [[Prince of Asturias]].  Eventually the name ''Las Islas Filipinas'' would be used to cover all the islands of the archipelago.  Before it became commonplace, other names such as ''Islas del Poniente'' (Islands of the West) and Magellan's name for the islands ''San L<U+00E1>zaro'' were also used by the Spanish to refer to the islands.<ref>{{Cite book|url=http://books.google.com/?id=15KZU-yMuisC|title=Barangay: Sixteenth-century Philippine Culture and Society|author=Scott, William Henry.|authorlink=William Henry Scott (historian)|publisher=Ateneo de Manila University Press

The official name of the Philippines has changed several times in the course of the country's history. During the [[Philippine Revolution]], the [[Malolos Congress]] proclaimed the establishment of the ''Rep<U+00FA>blica Filipina'' or the ''[[First Philippine Republic|Philippine Republic]]''. From the period of the [[Spanish-American War]] and the [[Philippine<U+2013>American War]] until the [[Commonwealth of the Philippines|Commonwealth]] period, American colonial authorities referred to the country as the ''Philippine Islands'', a translation of the Spanish name.  During the American period the name ''Philippines'' began to appear and it has since become the country's common name.<ref name =PhilIs>[[Manuel Quezon III|Quezon, Manuel, III]]. (2005-03-28).

Trade between the maritime-oriented peoples and other Asian countries during the subsequent period brought influences from [[Hinduism]], [[Buddhism]], and [[Islam]]. During this time there was no unifying political state encompassing the entire Philippine Archipelago. Instead, the islands were divided among competing [[Thalassocracy|thalassocracies]] ruled by various [[datu]]s, [[rajah]]s, or [[sultan]]s.

Spanish rule contributed significantly to bringing political unity to the archipelago. From 1565 to 1821, the Philippines was governed as a territory of the [[Viceroyalty of New Spain]] and then was administered directly from [[Madrid]] after the [[Mexican War of Independence]]. The [[Manila galleons]] linking Manila to [[Acapulco]] traveled once or twice a year between the 16th and 19th&nbsp;centuries.

In the 19th century, Philippine ports were opened to world trade and shifts were occurring within Philippine society. Many Spaniards born in the Philippines (''[[Criollo people|criollos]]'') and those of mixed ancestry (''[[mestizos]]'') became wealthy. The influx of Spanish and Latino settlers secularized churches and opened up government positions traditionally held by Spaniards born in the [[Iberian Peninsula]] (''[[peninsulares]]''). The ideals of revolution also began to spread through the islands. ''Criollo'' dissatisfaction resulted in the [[Cavite Mutiny|revolt in Cavite El Viejo]] in 1872 that was a precursor to the Philippine Revolution.<ref name=Agoncillo/><ref name="Cavite Mutiny">Nuguid, Nati.

Immediately after [[World War II]], the Philippines faced a number of challenges. The country had to be rebuilt from the ravages of war. It also had to come to terms with Japanese collaborators. Meanwhile, disgruntled remnants of the [[Hukbalahap]] communist rebel army that had previously fought against and resisted the Japanese continued to roam the rural [[Regions of the Philippines|regions]].

On August 21, 1983, Marcos' chief rival opposition leader [[Benigno Aquino, Jr.|Benigno "Ninoy" Aquino, Jr.]] ignored warnings and returned from exile in the United States.

==Politics and government==

{{Main|Politics of the Philippines|President of the Philippines|Constitution of the Philippines}}

The Philippines is a constitutional republic with a [[presidential system]] of government.  It is governed as a [[unitary state]] with the exception of the [[Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao]] which is largely free from the national government.  The [[President of the Philippines|President]] functions as both [[head of state]] and [[head of government]] and is the [[commander-in-chief]] of the [[Armed Forces of the Philippines|armed forces]]. The president is elected by popular vote for a single six-year term, during which he or she appoints and presides over the [[Cabinet (government)|cabinet]].<ref name="About"/>

The [[bicameral]] [[Congress of the Philippines|Congress]] is composed of the [[Senate of the Philippines|Senate]], serving as the [[upper house]], with members elected to a six-year term, and the [[House of Representatives of the Philippines|House of Representatives]], serving as the [[lower house]], with members elected to a three-year term. The senators are elected at large while the representatives are elected from both [[Legislative districts of the Philippines|legislative districts]] and through sectoral representation.<ref name="About"/>

The [[judiciary|judicial]] power is vested in the [[Supreme Court of the Philippines|Supreme Court]], composed of a [[Chief Justice of the Philippines|Chief Justice]] as its presiding officer and fourteen [[Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the Philippines|associate justices]], all of whom are appointed by the President from nominations submitted by the [[Judicial and Bar Council]].<ref name="About"/>

Relations with other nations are generally positive.  Shared democratic values ease relations with Western and European countries while similar economic concerns help in relations with other developing countries.  Historical ties and cultural similarities also serve as a bridge in relations with Spain and [[Latin America]]. Despite issues such as [[domestic abuse]] and war affecting overseas Filipino workers and obstacles posed by Islamic insurgency in Mindanao, relations with [[Middle East]]ern countries (including [[Egypt]], [[Iran]], [[Iraq]], [[Libya]], [[Saudi Arabia]], and the [[United Arab Emirates]]) are friendly as seen in the continuous employment of more than two million overseas Filipinos living there.

With communism no longer the threat it once was, once hostile relations in the 1950s between the Philippines and the [[People's Republic of China]] have improved greatly.

==Geography==
{{Main|Geography of the Philippines}}

The Philippines is an [[archipelago]] of 7,107 islands<ref name=About/> with a total land area, including inland bodies of water, of approximately {{convert|300,000|km2|sqmi|sp=us}}.  Its {{convert|36,289|km|mi|sp=us}} of coastline makes it the country with the 5th [[List of countries by length of coastline|longest coastline]] in the world.<ref name=About/><ref>Central Intelligence Agency.

The island of [[Borneo]] is located a few hundred kilometers southwest and Taiwan is located directly to the north. The [[Moluccas]] and [[Sulawesi]] are located to the south-southwest and [[Palau]] is located to the east of the islands.<ref name="About">[http://web.archive.org/web/20071022221129/http://www.gov.ph/aboutphil/general.asp General Information].

Most of the mountainous islands are covered in [[tropical rainforest]] and volcanic in origin. The highest mountain is [[Mount Apo]]. It measures up to 2,954&nbsp;meters (9,692&nbsp;feet) above sea level and is located on the island of Mindanao. The  Galathea Depth in the [[Philippine Trench]] is the deepest point in the country and the [[List of submarine topographical features#List of oceanic trenches|third deepest in the world]]. The trench is located in the [[Philippine Sea]]. The longest river is the [[Cagayan River]] in northern Luzon.  [[Manila Bay]], upon the shore of which the capital city of Manila lies, is connected to [[Laguna de Bay]], the largest lake in the Philippines, by the [[Pasig River]]. [[Subic Bay]], the [[Davao Gulf]], and the [[Moro Gulf]] are other important bays. The [[San Juanico Strait]] separates the islands of Samar and Leyte but it is traversed by the [[San Juanico Bridge]].<ref>Republic of the Philippines. Department of Tourism. [ca. 2008].

The Philippines has a tropical maritime [[climate]] and is usually hot and humid.

Philippine cuisine has evolved over several centuries from its [[Malayo-Polynesian]] origins to become a mixed cuisine with many [[Hispanic]], [[Chinese cuisine|Chinese]], [[Cuisine of the United States|American]], and other [[Asian cuisine|Asian]] influences that have been adapted to local ingredients and the Filipino palate to create distinctively Filipino dishes.  Dishes range from the very simple, like a meal of fried salted fish and rice, to the elaborate, such as the ''[[paella]]s'' and ''[[cozido|cocidos]]'' created for fiestas.  Popular dishes include ''[[lech<U+00F3>n]]'', ''[[Adobo (Filipino cuisine)|adobo]]'', ''[[sinigang]]'', ''[[kare-kare]]'', ''[[Tapa (Filipino cuisine)|tapa]]'', crispy ''pata'', ''[[pancit]]'', ''[[lumpia]]'', and ''[[halo-halo]]''.  Some common local ingredients used in cooking are [[calamondin]]s, coconuts, ''saba'' (a kind of short wide [[plantain]]), [[mangoes]], [[milkfish]], and [[fish sauce]].  Filipino taste buds tend to favor robust flavors but the cuisine is not as spicy as those of its neighbors.<ref name=Jollibee2/><ref name=Zialcita>

Philippine mythology has been handed down primarily through the traditional oral folk literature of the Filipino people.  While each unique ethnic group has its own stories and myths to tell, Hindu and Spanish influence can nonetheless be detected in many cases.  Many of the myths are creation stories or stories about supernatural creatures, such as the ''[[aswang]]'' (vampire), the ''[[diwata]]'' (fairy), and Nature.  Some popular figures from Philippine mythologies are [[Maria Makiling]], [[Biag ni Lam-Ang|Lam-Ang]], and the [[Sarimanok]].<ref name=Lopez>{{Cite book

Philippine literature comprises works usually written in Filipino, Spanish, or English.  Some of the most known were created in the 19th&nbsp;century.  [[Francisco Balagtas]] the poet and playwright who wrote ''[[Florante at Laura]]'' is recognized as a preeminent writer in the Filipino language.  [[Jos<U+00E9> Rizal]] wrote the novels ''[[Noli Me Tangere (novel)|Noli Me Tangere]]'' (''Touch Me Not'') and ''[[El Filibusterismo]]'' (''The Filibustering'', also known as ''The Reign of Greed'') and is considered a national hero.  His depiction of the injustices of Spanish rule, and his death by firing squad, inspired other Philippine revolutionaries to seek independence.  In the 20th&nbsp;century, among those officially recognized as [[National Artists of the Philippines]] in literature are [[N.V.M. Gonzalez]], [[Nick Joaquin]], [[F. Sionil Jose]], and [[Alejandro Roces]].<ref name=Artists>Republic of the Philippines. National Commission for Culture and the Arts.
