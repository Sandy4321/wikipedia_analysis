'''John Appleton''' (February 11, 1815 <U+2013> August 22, 1864) was an American [[lawyer]] and [[politician]], who served multiple positions domestic and abroad. Born in [[Beverly, Massachusetts]], Appleton was a graduate of [[Bowdoin College]] (1834) and attended [[Harvard Law School]] (1835<U+2013>36). After graduating, Appleton became a lawyer for various firms, including his own, and became the lead editor of the ''Eastern Argus'' in 1838. His first official political job was in 1840 when he became the registrar of [[probate]]s for [[Cumberland County, Maine]]. In 1845, Appleton was appointed by [[George Bancroft]] to become the Chief Clerk of the [[United States Department of the Navy]]. He took this post until 1848 when he took the post of Chief Clerk of the [[United States Department of State]].

In 1849, Appleton was appointed the first ''[[charg<U+00E9> d'affaires]]'' of [[Bolivia]]. At the end of his post (1849), he returned to [[Portland, Maine]], and became elected to [[Maine's 2nd congressional district]] in 1851 by a small margin of approximately 40 votes. Appleton did not go for reelection in 1852, and became a diplomatic envoy to [[London, England]], in 1855 to help negotiations with the [[Crimean War]]. Appleton was appointed [[United States Assistant Secretary of State]] in 1857 which he served until 1860. In that year, he served as an envoy to [[Russia]] until his retirement from politics in 1861. Appleton died in Portland on August 22, 1864, and buried at [[Evergreen Cemetery (Portland, Maine)|Evergreen Cemetery]]
