'''''Chorioactis''''' is a [[genus]] of [[fungus]] that contains the single species '''''Chorioactis geaster''''';<ref>Although ''geaster'' means "earth star", this fungus is not related to the species ''[[Geastraceae|Geaster]]'' or any of the [[Geastraceae]].</ref> the mushroom is [[common name|commonly]] known as the '''devil<U+2019>s cigar''' or the '''Texas star''' in the United States, while in Japan it is called {{Nihongo3 || <U+30AD><U+30EA><U+30CE><U+30DF><U+30BF><U+30B1>|'''kirinomitake'''}}.
This extremely rare mushroom is notable for its unusual appearance and [[disjunct distribution]]: it is only found only in select locales in [[Texas]] and [[Japan]]. The [[sporocarp (fungi)|fruit body]], which grows on the stumps or dead roots of [[ulmus crassifolia|cedar elm]]s (in Texas) or dead [[oak]]s (in Japan), somewhat resembles a dark brown or black cigar before it splits open radially into a starlike arrangement of four to seven leathery rays. The interior surface of the fruit body bears the [[spore]]-bearing tissue known as the [[hymenium]], and is colored white to brown, depending on its age. Fruit body opening can be accompanied by a distinct hissing sound and the release of a smoky cloud of [[spore]]s. 

Fruit bodies were first collected in [[Austin, Texas]] in 1893, and the species was named ''Urnula geaster''; it was later found in [[Ky<U+016B>sh<U+016B>|Kyushu]] in 1937, but the mushroom was not reported again in Japan until 1973. Although the new genus ''Chorioactis'' was proposed to accommodate the unique species a few years after its original discovery, it was not until 1968 that it was accepted as a valid genus. Its [[biological classification|classification]] has also been a source of confusion. Historically, ''Chorioactis'' was placed in the [[Sarcosomataceae]] family of fungi, despite inconsistencies in the microscopic structure of the [[ascus]], the saclike structure in which spores are formed. [[Molecular phylogenetics|Phylogenetic]] analyses of the past decade have clarified the fungus's classification: ''Chorioactis'', along with three other genera, make up the [[Chorioactidaceae]] family, a grouping of related fungi formally acknowledged in 2008. In 2009, Japanese researchers reported discovering a form of the fungus missing the sexual stage of its [[biological life cycle|life cycle]]; this [[Teleomorph, anamorph and holomorph|asexual state]] was named ''Kumanasamuha geaster''.

== History ==

The fungus was first collected in [[Austin, Texas]] in 1893 by botanist [[Lucien Marcus Underwood]], who sent the specimens to mycologist [[Charles Horton Peck]] for identification. Peck described the species as ''Urnula geaster'' in that year's ''Annual Report of the New York State botanist'', although he expressed doubt about its [[genus|generic]] placement in ''[[Urnula]]''.<ref name=Peck1893/> In 1902, student mycologist Elsie Kupfer questioned the proposed [[biological classification|classification]] of various species in the genera ''Urnula'' and ''[[Geopyxis]]'', as suggested in an 1896 publication on the [[Discomycetes]] by German mycologist [[Heinrich Rehm]]. She considered Rehm's transfer of the species to the genus ''Geopyxis'' illogical: <blockquote>"Even externally the fungus does not closely answer Rehm's own description of the genus ''Geopyxis'' under which he places it; the texture of the apothecium is described as fleshy, the stem, as short and sometimes thin; while in this plant, the leathery character of the cup and the length and thickness of the stem are its noticeable features."</blockquote> Working with Underwood's guidance, Kupfer compared the microscopic structure of the [[hymenium]] (the fertile, spore-bearing tissue) of the Texan species with a number of similar ones<U+2014>''[[Geopyxis carbonaria]]'', ''[[Urnula craterium]]'', and ''Urnula terrestris'' (now known as ''[[Podophacidium|Podophacidium xanthomelum]]''). She concluded that the Texan species was so dissimilar as to warrant its own genus, which she named ''Chorioactis''.<ref name=Kupfer1902/> Although this [[taxonomy|taxonomical]] change was opposed in later studies of the fungus by [[Frederick De Forest Heald]] and [[Frederick Adolf Wolf]] (1910)<ref name=Heald1910/> and [[Fred Jay Seaver]] (1928, 1942),<ref name=Seaver1928/><ref name=Seaver1942/> ''Chorioactis'' was established as a valid genus in 1968 by [[Finn-Egil Eckblad]] in his comprehensive [[monograph]] about the Discomycetes.<ref name=Eckblad1968/><ref name=Fungorum/>

==Classification and naming==

Historically, ''Chorioactis'' was considered to be in the [[Sarcosomataceae]] family.<ref name=Korf1970/><ref name=Korf1973/> A 1983 [[monograph]] on the family included ''Chorioactis'' in the [[tribe (biology)|tribe]] Sarcosomateae (along with the genera ''[[Desmazierella]]'', ''[[Sarcosoma]]'', ''[[Korfiella]]'', ''[[Plectania]]'', and ''[[Urnula]]''), a grouping of fungi characterized by having spores lacking small wartlike projections (verruculae) capable of absorbing blue dye.<ref name=Paden1983/>  A 1994 study of the structural features of the [[ascus|asci]] and the [[ascospore]]s concluded that ''Chorioactis'' was more closely aligned with the [[Sarcoscyphaceae]], although it conceded that the layering of the cells comprising the walls of the ascus differed considerably from the other members of the family.<ref name=Bellemere1994/> It was not until 1999 that the results of [[molecular phylogenetics|phylogenetic]] analysis firmly challenged the traditional classification, showing ''C.&nbsp;geaster'' to be part of a distinct lineage, or [[clade]], that includes species in the genera ''[[Desmazierella]]'', ''[[Neournula]]'', and ''[[Wolfina]]'', taxa that were distributed among both families.<ref name=Harrington1999/> This analysis was later corroborated when it was shown that the grouping of these four genera (by then called the "Chorioactis clade") represented a [[cladistics|sister clade]] to the Sarcosomataceae,<ref name=Hansen2006/> and a new family, the [[Chorioactidaceae]], was erected to contain them.<ref name=Pfister2008/> Although ''C.&nbsp;geaster'' shares some characteristics with the other Chorioactidaceae genera, including dark-colored superficial "hairs" on the outer surface of the fruit bodies, it is distinguished from them by its tan- to orange- (rather than black) [[hymenium|hymenia]].<ref name=Pfister2004/>
[[File:PaulowniaTomentosaShell.jpg|thumb|right|Spent seed pods of ''kiri'', the Empress tree|alt=A cluster of empty brown roughly circular pods that are split lengthwise into two halves hinged together on the end connected to a branch. The roughly two dozen pods are distributed among about five small twigs on a tree branch, against a background of green leaves.]]
The [[specific name|species name]] ''geaster'' alludes to its superficial resemblance to members of genus ''[[Geastrum]]'', which also open to form star-shaped fruit bodies commonly called "earthstars". In the United States, ''Chorioactis geaster'' is [[common name|commonly]] known as the Texas star, or the devil's cigar.<ref name=Rudy1996/> Regarding the origin of the latter name American mycologist Fred Jay Seaver commented: "Whether the name Devil's Cigar refers to the form of the young specimens which resemble a bloated cigar in form, as well as in color, or to the fact that the fungus appears to "smoke" at maturity, we cannot say ... At any rate, the name is very appropriate."<ref name=Seaver1942/> In 1997, Texan state Senator [[Chris Harris (Texas politician)|Chris Harris]] filed a [[bill (proposed law)|bill]] to make ''C.&nbsp;geaster'' the [[List of Texas state symbols|official state]] fungus of Texas.<ref name=TexasLegislature/> The bill passed the [[Texas Senate|Senate]] but did not succeed in the [[Texas House of Representatives|House]].<ref name=Kelso2006/> In Japan the mushroom is called ''kirinomitake'' (<U+30AD><U+30EA><U+30CE><U+30DF><U+30BF><U+30B1>), because the immature, unopened fruit body bears some resemblance to the seed pods of ''kiri'', the Empress tree (''[[Paulownia tomentosa]]'').<ref name=Peterson2004/>

== Description ==
[[File:Chorioactis geaster 2.jpg|thumb|left|A specimen shortly after dehiscence, but before splitting into recurved rays.|alt=A hand holding a dark brown, roughly cigar-shaped object with a lengthwise split that goes about halfway down its length. The split reveals light colored tissue within; some partially obscured light colored tissue can be seen out on the far edge, suggesting a similar split on that side.]]
Young specimens of ''C.&nbsp;geaster'' have a hollow, club-shaped dark-brown fruit body, connected to a [[stipe (mycology)|stem]]. The stem, which is usually buried in the ground, is shorter than the hollow fruit body or equals it in length, although the stem length is somewhat variable  depending on the depth of the underground root to which it is attached. The [[trama (mycology)|flesh]] of the stem and the wall of the fruit body is white, while the inner surface is yellowish-white, turning light brown with age. The fruit body varies in width from {{convert|1.2|to|3.5|cm|in|1|abbr=on}} in the thickest portion, and has a length of {{convert|4|to|12|cm|1|in|abbr=on}}; the stem is {{convert|0.75|to|1.5|cm|in|1|abbr=on}} wide by {{convert|1|to|5|cm|in|1|abbr=on}} long.<ref name=Heald1910/> Both stem and fruit body are covered by a dense layer of soft brown velvety "hairs", or [[wikt:tomentose|tomentum]]. In maturity, the fruit body splits open into 4<U+2013>7 rays that curve downward, similar to mushrooms of the genus ''[[Geastrum]]''. The spores are borne on the inner surface of the rays, which, depending on the maturity of the specimen, may range in color from whitish to [[saffron (color)|saffron]] to [[salmon (color)|salmon]] to butterscotch to [[chestnut (color)|chestnut]].<ref name=Pfister2008/> The leathery rays are up to {{convert|0.35|cm|in|1|abbr=on}} thick.<ref name=Heald1910/>

The fruit body remains closed until shortly before spore discharge; [[Dehiscence (botany)|dehiscence]] (fruit body opening) is caused by the pressure exerted by swollen [[paraphyses]]<U+2014>sterile (i.e., non-reproductive) cells that are interspersed between the [[ascospore]]s.<ref name=Pfister1978/> Dehiscence is accompanied by the release of clouds of spores resembling dust;<ref name="Country Scientist: Texas star"/> the characteristic shape of the unopened fruit body, as well as the smoky spore release give the fungus its common name "Devil's cigar".<ref name=Peterson2004/> The spore puffing upon rupture is thought to be caused by the sudden change in relative humidity between the interior chamber of the fruit body and the outside environment.<ref name=Heald1910/> Dehiscence is accompanied by a hissing sound, an auditory phenomenon known to occur in about fifteen other fungal species.<ref name=Rudy1996/>

===Microscopic characteristics===
[[File:Chorioactis spore.jpg|thumb|right|Spores are oblong or spindle-shaped, and contain 3 to 5 oil droplets.|alt=Drawing of an oblong object with somewhat pointed ends, and with five internal clear circular areas of varying sizes.]]
[[Ascospore|Spores]] are [[wikt:oblong|oblong]] to spindle-shaped, and are flattened on one side; they have dimensions of 54<U+2013>68&nbsp;[[micrometre|<U+00B5>m]] by 10<U+2013>13&nbsp;<U+00B5>m. The spores each contain 3<U+2013>5 oil drops. Although the spores have been described as smooth in older literature,<ref name=Korf1972/> when viewed with [[transmission electron microscopy]], they are seen to have minute spots or punctures.<ref name=Pfister2004/> The spores develop simultaneously (synchronously) within the [[ascus]], a developmental feature shared with the [[Sarcoscyphaceae]] genera ''[[Cookeina]]'' and ''[[Microstoma (mushroom)|Microstoma]]''.<ref name=Pfister2004/> Like other members of the [[Pezizales]] order, the [[ascus|asci]] of ''C.&nbsp;geaster'' have an [[operculum (botany)|operculum]]<U+2014>a "lid"<U+2014>that opens when the spores are discharged. However, the operculum of ''C.&nbsp;geaster'' develops a two-layered ring zone upon dehiscence, making it structurally distinct from members of both the [[Sarcosomataceae]] and the [[Sarcoscyphaceae]] families.<ref name=Pfister2004/>

Similar to other Discomycetes, the fruit body consists of three distinct layers of tissue: the [[hymenium]], the hypothecium, and the excipulum. The spore-bearing hymenium, the outermost layer of cells, contains asci interspersed with sterile cells called [[paraphyses]].<ref name=Alexopoulos1996/> In ''C.&nbsp;geaster'', the club-shaped asci are 700<U+2013>800&nbsp;<U+00B5>m long and 14<U+2013>17.25&nbsp;<U+00B5>m thick;<ref name=Heald1910/> they are abruptly constricted at the base to a narrow [[wikt:pedicel|pedicel]]. The paraphyses are initially [[wikt:filamentous|filamentous]] or thread-like ([[wikt:filiform|filiform]]) but swell with age to resemble a string of beads ([[wikt:monoliform|monoliform]]).<ref name=Pfister2004/> The swelling of the paraphyses is believed to cause the expansion of the hymenium and subsequent splitting of the fruit body into rays; this development places the asci into an optimal position for spore release and dispersal.<ref name=Seaver1937/> Supporting the cells of the hymenium is a thin layer of tightly interwoven [[hypha]]e called the hypothecium, and underneath this is a thick layer of loosely-interwoven hyphae known as the exipulum. This tissue layer, analogous to [[Ground tissue#Parenchyma|parenchyma]] found in plants, gives the tissue a fibrous texture. The exipulum layer averages 34&nbsp;<U+00B5>m in diameter, while the hypothecium is 10<U+2013>14&nbsp;<U+00B5>m.<ref name=Kupfer1902/> When viewed with [[electron microscope|electron microscopy]], the dark brown "hairs" on the surface of the fruit body can be seen to be adorned with conical warts or spines.<ref name=Bellemere1994/>

===Anamorph form===
The so-called anamorphic or [[fungi imperfecti|imperfect fungi]] are those that seem to lack a sexual stage in their [[biological life cycle|life cycle]], and typically reproduce by the process of [[mitosis]] in structures called [[conidium|conidia]]. In some cases, the sexual stage<U+2014>or [[teleomorph, anamorph and holomorph|teleomorph]] stage<U+2014>is later identified, and a teleomorph-anamorph relationship is established between the species. The [[International Code of Botanical Nomenclature]] permits the recognition of two (or more) names for one and the same organisms, one based on the teleomorph, the other(s) restricted to the anamorph.  In 2004, researchers reported a connection between ''C.&nbsp;geaster'' and the appearance of blackish-brown tufted structures on rotting wood. By comparing the [[internal transcribed spacer]] region of the [[nucleus (cell)|nuclear]] [[ribosomal DNA]] from the two organisms, they established a [[phylogenetics|phylogenetic]] connection between ''Chorioactis'' and the fungus they called ''[[Conoplea]]'' aff. ''elegantula''. However, they were unable to induce the new organism to grow on artificial media, and did not definitively establish a teleomorph-anamorph connection between the fungi.<ref name=Peterson2004/> In 2009, Japanese researchers found a similar fungus growing on rotting logs that were normally associated with the growth of ''C.&nbsp;geaster''; they were able to grow the organism in [[axenic|axenic cultures]] from single-spore isolates of ''C.&nbsp;geaster''. They named the anamorph ''Kumanasamuha geaster'' due to its [[morphology (biology)|morphological]] similarity with species in the genus ''[[Kumanasamuha]]''.<ref name=Nagao2009/>

== Distribution, ecology, and habitat ==

''Chorioactis geaster'' has a [[disjunct distribution]], and has only been collected from [[Texas]] and [[Japan]]. The first reported collection in Japan was in [[Ky<U+016B>sh<U+016B>|Kyushu]] in 1937,<ref name=Imazeki1938/> and then it was not collected again in that location until thirty-six years later.<ref name=Imazeki1975/> In 2006, it was observed in a humid forest near [[Kawakami, Nara|Kawakami]], [[Nara Prefecture]].<ref name=MSoJ52/> The fungus's natural habitat in Japan is disappearing because of the practice of [[deforestation]] and replanting with Japanese cedar (''[[Cryptomeria|Cryptomeria japonica]]'').<ref name=Nagao2009/> This rare mushroom has been put on the list of [[threatened species]] in Japan.<ref name="urlwww.biodic.go.jp"/> In Texas, the fungus has been reported in [[Collin County, Texas|Collin County]],<ref name=Ubelaker2005/> [[Travis County, Texas|Travis]], [[Dallas]], [[Denton County, Texas|Denton]], [[Guadalupe County, Texas|Guadalupe]], [[Tarrant County, Texas|Tarrant]] and [[Hunt County, Texas|Hunt]] Counties.<ref name="urlUntitled Document"/> Travis and Guadalupe counties are in central Texas, while the remainder are clustered together in the northeastern part of the state. Although the species is considered rare due to its globally restricted distribution, it may be locally abundant.<ref name=Heald1910/><ref name=Rudy1996/>
[[File:Chorioactis geaster 1.jpg|thumb|right|Texan specimen that clearly shows differences in the color and texture of outer, inner, and internal surfaces.|alt=A star-shaped mushroom  with four rays growing on the ground, surrounded by dead leaves. The interior surface of the mushroom is butterscotch colored, and the center of the mushroom is cracked to reveal the white tissue layer underneath. The external surface is rough, and a dark brown color.]]
Although it is not known definitively, ''Chorioactis'' is believed to be [[detritivore|saprobic]], deriving nutrients from decomposing organic matter.<ref name=Hansen2006/> In Texas, fruit bodies are found growing singly or in groups from roots, stumps, and dead roots of [[Ulmus crassifolia|cedar elm trees]] (''Ulmus crassifolia'')<ref name=MSA1996/> or ''[[Symplocos myrtacea]]'';<ref name=Dunaway2007/><ref name=Pfister2008/> in Japan, the usual host is dead [[Oak|oak trees]].<ref name="urlwww.biodic.go.jp"/> Fruit bodies can be clustered together close to the base of the stump, or from the roots away from the stump; the [[stipe (mycology)|stem]] of the fruit body tends to originate from a point {{convert|5|to|10|cm|in|0|abbr=on}} below the ground.<ref name=Heald1910/> In Texas, fruit bodies usually appear between October and April, as this period is associated with somewhat cooler weather, and the temperature and moisture conditions during this time seem to be more favorable for growth.<ref name=Heald1910/>

Scientists do not know why the fungus mysteriously lives only in Texas and Japan, locations of approximately the same [[latitude]],<ref name=Peterson2004/> but separated by {{convert|11000|km|mi|abbr=on}}. Fred Jay Seaver commented "this is only another illustration of the unusual and unpredictable distribution of many species of the fungi. It would be difficult indeed to account for it, and we merely accept the facts as they are."<ref name=Seaver1939/> In 2004, a research study compared the DNA sequences of both populations and used a combination of [[molecular phylogenetics]] and [[molecular clock]] calculations to estimate the extent of genetic divergence. It concluded that the two populations have been separated for at least nineteen million years, ruling out the possibility of human introduction of the species from one location to the other.<ref name=Peterson2004/> Although there are no consistent differences in [[morphology (biology)|morphology]] between the two populations, there are several differences in their [[life history|life histories]]. The preferred host of Texan populations is typically roots and stumps of ''Ulmus crassifola'', while the Japanese populations tend to grow on the fallen trunks of ''Symplocos myrtaceae'' and ''Quercus gilva''. Texan species grow in areas subjected to periodic flooding, unlike their Japanese counterparts. Finally, only Japanese specimens can be grown in culture<U+2014>the spores of Texan material have not been successfully germinated on artificial [[growth medium|media]].<ref name=Peterson2004/><ref name=Nagao2009/>
