Clackline Nature Reserve has two distinct landforms. To the west is a gently undulating terrain and in the east the land is dissected into steep sided valleys and ridges. Vegetation is chiefly woodland with variation in trees with soil type. They include [[jarrah]], [[marri wandoo]], [[Eucalyptus accedens|powderbark wandoo]], [[brown mallet]], [[rock sheoak]], [[Nuytsia floribunda|Christmas tree]] and [[bull banksia]]. A rare species of orchid not known in any other reserve occurs, [[caladenia]] triangularis.<ref name=ahdb>{{cite web|author1=Department of the Environment|title=Clackline Nature Reserve (1978 boundary), Refractory Rd, Clackline, WA, Australia|url=http://www.environment.gov.au/cgi-bin/ahdb/search.pl?mode=place_detail;place_id=9969|website=Australian Heritage Database|publisher=Commonwealth of Australia|accessdate=3 June 2014|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20140527031009/http://www.environment.gov.au/cgi-bin/ahdb/search.pl?mode=place_detail;place_id=9969|archivedate=27 May 2014|deadurl=no}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author1=Shire of Northam|title=Clackline Nature Reserve (1978 & 1993 Boundaries)|url=http://inherit.stateheritage.wa.gov.au/Public/Inventory/Details/d0692c13-f959-4929-b41e-0132b68de04e|publisher=State Heritage Office, Government of Western Australia|accessdate=3 June 2014|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20140527025451/http://inherit.stateheritage.wa.gov.au/Public/Inventory/Details/d0692c13-f959-4929-b41e-0132b68de04e|archivedate=27 May 2014 |deadurl=no|date=4 June 2013}}</ref>

===Vegetation===
There are a range of soil types across Clackline Nature Reserve, with clays, sandy clays and loamy soils in the lower sections of the topography, while pallid zone clays are exposed on erosional slopes, and gravely soils occur at the top of breakaways. There is a similar diversity of vegetation, with [[Eucalyptus wandoo|wandoo]] at the low points, [[Eucalyptus accedens|powderbark]] on the slopes, and jarrah or marri woodland on the breakaway tops. There are five general patterns of vegetation based around these species:<ref name=plan87-97 />{{rp|19}}
{{Quotation|
#Wandoo (Eucalyptus wandoo) WOODLAND, 15-18 m in height, with some marri (E. calophylla) and jarrah (E. marginata) and patches of sheoak (Allocasuarina huegeliana). The understorey is generally open and dominated by blackboys (Xanthorrhoea preissii), parrot bush (Dryandra sessilis) and pingle (D. carduacea). Patches of pingle THICKET, 2-3m. in height, occur occasionally.
# Powderbark (Eucalyptus accedens) FOREST/WOODLAND, 15-18 m in height, with a variable component of wandoo, marri and Jarrah. The percentage cover of the undetstorey is highly variable, ranging from very sparse to dense. Dominant species include blackboys, parrot bush, Hakea trifurcata and bullock poison (Gastrolobium trilobum).
# Jarrah/marri WOODLAND/OPEN WOODLAND, 1.5-20 m in height, over a highly diverse understorey. Much of this diversity is a direct response to changes in soil type, from laterite-gravel loams to sand. A pingle and Hakea trifurcata dominated SCRUB/THICKET occurs on the gravelly surfaces, while the understorey on the sandplain areas varies from Eremaea pauciflora and mountain kunzea (Kunzea recurva) TPICKET/DENSE THICKET, 2-3 m in height, to Leptospermum, erubescens and Hakea trifurcata dominated THICKET/SCRUB to 2.5 m.
# Marri WOODLAND, 15-17 m in height, over jam (Acacia acuminata) and sheoak LOW WOODLAND A over LOW GRASS.
# Sheoak LOW WOODLAND A/LOW FOREST A, 6-8 m in height, with an open understorey. Jam appears occasionally<ref name=plan87-97 />{{rp|19<U+2013>20}}}}

The reserve contains the rare plant species ''[[acacia aphylla]]'' (Leafless Rock Wattle) and the [[Declared Rare and Priority Flora List|priority two]] flora species ''[[stenanthemum grandiflorum]]''.<ref>{{Cite book | author1=Wooller, Susan J | author2=Moore, Susan A | author3=Australian Heritage Commission | author4=Western Australian Natural Environment Evaluation Panel | title=Regional assessment of the Wheatbelt of Western Australia: Central Wheatbelt | date=June 2000 | publisher=Murdoch University | isbn=978-0-86905-746-9 |url=http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/21252/1/regional_assessment_of_the_wheatbelt_of_WA.pdf |format=PDF |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6PsBjxVb0 |archivedate=27 May 2014 |deadurl=no |pages=37, 39}}</ref>
===Fauna===
Clackline Nature Reserve is home to a variety of different species. Typical mammals in the reserve are the western grey kangaroo (Macropus fuliginosus), western brush wallaby (M. irma), euro (M. robustus), echidna (Tachyglossus aculeatus) and rabbit. A variety of reptiles are present, including at least five frog, four gecko,
three legless lizard, one dragon, two goarina{{clarify|post-text=(see [[Talk:Clackline Nature Reserve#Goarina|talk]])|date=June 2014}}, five skink, and five snake species; and there are more than fifty species of bird, notably the Wedge-tailed Eagle and Dusky Woodswallows.<ref name=plan87-97 />{{rp|22}}

==History==

===Background===
Though part of a north-south ridge system, the Clackline area has been easily accessed for many years due to the gap through which [[Clackline Brook]], [[Great Eastern Highway]], and the former [[Eastern Railway (Western Australia)|Eastern Railway]] passed. While the southern area was released for agriculture and settlement, the area to the north was too rugged, postponing its release. In 1928, an application was made to purchase land in the area. However, as the block was "carrying good stands of Wandoo" according to the Conservator of Forests, on 6 January 1929 a timber reserve was created, with an area of {{convert|544|acre}}. Over the next 44 years, however, the area decreased to {{convert|130|ha}}.<ref name=plan87-97 />{{rp|17}}

===Establishment===
A nearby resident, botanist Ray Paynter, coordinated an effort to protect the Clackline area for conservation purposes in the 1960s and 70s. The Department of Mines opposed the idea, even though the operators of [[Clackline Refractory]], which mined in the area, were supportive. Paynter and the Clackline community continued to push for the creation of a reserve. On 3 March 1973, he wrote to Northam MLA Mr K. McIver, citing the species of birds, orchids, and kangaroos that would benefit. Nine months later, on 21 December 1973, a reserve "was set aside for the Conservation of Flora and Fauna".<ref name=plan87-97 />{{rp|17<U+2013>18}}

===Expansion===
Recommendations from the Department of Environment and Conservation in 1983 proposed increasing the area of Clackline Nature Reserve by {{convert|278|ha}}.<ref name=plan87-97 />{{rp|18<U+2013>19}}

One of the conditions for environmental approval for clearing for construction of [[Fiona Stanley Hospital]] was that "{{convert|41.2|ha|disp=x|4=&nbsp;[|5=]}} ... of breeding and limited foraging habitat for Carnaby's Black-Cockatoo has been secured for purchase as is to be included in the Clackline Nature Reserve".<ref>{{cite web |title=Approval: Fiona Stanley Hospital Proposal (EPBC 2008/39720) |last1=Garrett |last2=Peter |date=7 February 2008 |url=http://www.environment.gov.au/epbc/notices/assessments/2008/3970/signed-approval-instrument.pdf |format=PDF |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20140527032558/http://www.environment.gov.au/epbc/notices/assessments/2008/3970/signed-approval-instrument.pdf |archivedate=27 May 2014 |deadurl=no |accessdate=3 June 2014}}</ref>
