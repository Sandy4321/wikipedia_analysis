'''''Play''''' is a 1991 album by the British [[New Wave music|New Wave]] group [[Squeeze]]. It is the band's ninth album, and their only released by [[Reprise Records]]. It is also of note as it is the first LP in the Squeeze discography to feature only four official members instead of five ([[Steve Nieve]] took on many of the keyboard duties that would have gone to [[Jools Holland]] in the past).  [[Tony Berg]] produced the album, which, despite weak sales, is a fan favorite. In the liner notes to the 1996 Squeeze compilation ''[[Excess Moderation]]'', [[Glenn Tilbrook]] stated that he considers ''Play'' the beginning of Squeeze's "renaissance period."

The liner notes to the album are, appropriately, in the form of a play that incorporates the lyrics of the songs in a script that also references the plays ''[[Our Town]]'' by [[Thorton Wilder]] and ''[[Waiting for Godot]]'' by [[Samuel Beckett]].
