'''Baggensgatan''' ([[Swedish language|Swedish]]: "The Street of Bagge{{ref|bagge}}") is a [[street]] in [[Gamla stan]], the [[old town]] in central [[Stockholm]], [[Sweden]]. Forming a southern extension to the street [[Bollhusgr<U+00E4>nd]] near the square [[K<U+00F6>pmantorget]], it stretches to the southern end of [[Svartmangatan]].  It forms a parallel street to [[Sj<U+00E4>lag<U+00E5>rdsgatan]] and [[<U+00D6>sterl<U+00E5>nggatan]], while being intercepted by [[Tyska Skolgr<U+00E4>nd]].

== Origin of the name ==
Appearing in historical records as ''Jakob Bagg<U+00E6>s gathe'' in 1596, the street was named after the then admiral [[Jakob Bagge]] (1502-1577) (later governor at the [[Stockholm Palace|Royal Palace]]) who was given a lot by King [[Gustav I of Sweden|Gustav Vasa]] at number 30 in 1536.  It is mentioned as ''Baggenss gatu'' 1638.<ref name="Gatunamn">{{cite book

== History ==
Together with [[Bollhusgr<U+00E4>nd]], Baggensgatan formed a street passing just inside the eastern city wall, just like [[Pr<U+00E4>stgatan]] passed just inside the western wall.  The difference in altitude between the central plateau of the original medieval old town and the surrounding water shores are biggest between <U+00D6>sterl<U+00E5>nggatan and Baggensgatan, almost ten metres.  In the southern end, the lowest section of the street, was the [[Blackfriar]]s monastery.<ref name="Glase-baggens">{{cite book | language = Swedish

== Notable buildings ==
On '''Number 14''' lived the opera diva [[Elisabeth Olin]], at the age of 33 she became the first [[prima donna]] at the inauguration of the opera of King [[Gustav III of Sweden|Gustav III]] on January 18, 1773.  Her voice was described as supernatural and though she retired from singing after ten years, she is said to have kept her beauty until her death at the age of 87.<ref name="Glase-baggens" />

The building on '''Number 23''' was known as ''Ahlstr<U+00F6>ms jungfrubur'' ("The Maiden Cage of Ahlstr<U+00F6>m").  It was bought in 1762 by a captain Magnus Ahlstr<U+00F6>m who is described as having created a "virtual temple of Venus with space for the priestesses on all three floors".  Though the brothel made Ahlstr<U+00F6>m rich, it often resulted in squads of prostitutes spending time at the [[L<U+00E5>ngholmen prison]] while all the taverns and other brothels gave the street a bad reputation for a long time.<ref name="Glase-baggens" />

The building on '''Number 25''' use to be a stable, the shutters were the only thing protecting the horses from the harsh Swedish winters.<ref name="Glase-baggens" />

On the fa<U+00E7>ade of '''Number 27''' is the [[coat of arms]] of Scotch Anders Keith and his wife who lived in the building in the end of the 16th century when he served King [[John III of Sweden|John III]].  He sold the building to [[Sigismund III Vasa|Sigismund of of Sweden and Poland]], who, wanting to reintroduce Catholicism in Sweden, who used it as a [[presbytery]] and a chapel, a failed propaganda campaign which gave the building the name ''Paptistkyrkan'' ("The Papist Church").

== In culture ==
The troubadour [[Carl Michael Bellman]] (1740-1795) dedicated one of his songs to Baggensgatan:
: '''''S<U+00E5>ng 54''''' : Mollberg h<U+00F6>ll flaskan - Om Baggensgatan''
: '''Song 54''' : Mollberg held the bottle - About Baggensgatan
The song gives a burlesque description of the alley, detailing maidens nodding in every corner, buildings filled with girls up to the attic busy sharing songs, kisses, and beds. The song ends: ''Sl<U+00E4>ck ljuset! Nu <U+00E4> Lotta min.'' / "Turn off the light! Now, Lotta is mine."<ref name="Bellman">{{cite web
