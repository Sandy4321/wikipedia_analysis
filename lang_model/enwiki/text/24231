The museum was founded by two antique collectors, an American, [[Dallas Pratt]] (August 21, 1914&nbsp;<U+2013> May 20, 1994)<ref>[http://www.freshford.com/pratt.htm Biographical notes on Dallas Pratt]</ref> and a Briton, [[John Judkyn]] (1913&nbsp;<U+2013> July 27, 1963)<ref>[http://www.freshford.com/judkin1.htm Personal recollections of John Judkyn by Dallas Pratt]</ref> and opened to the public for the first time on July 1, 1961.

The exhibits cover every period of [[American history]]. Because John Judkyn was a [[Quaker]], the museum contains no [[militaria]].
Included are 200 [[quilt]]s and coverlets, and several pieces of [[Shaker]] furniture.

== Garden ==

The garden is set into the valley of the [[River Avon, Bristol|River Avon]] and has fine views over the valley and the [[Kennet and Avon Canal]]. The American Museum employed [[Lanning Roper]] to design a mixed border. There is a Colonial [[Herb]] Garden and a [[Mount Vernon]] Garden, which is a re-creation of [[George Washington]]'s garden. The [[arboretum]] has a collection of American trees.<ref name=Garden/>

== Artists in the collection ==
* [[Susan Powers]]

The collection of portraits includes works by [[John Brewster, Jr.]], [[Ammi Phillips]] and William Matthew Prior. There are also carved eagles by Wilhelm Schimmel and Frederick Myrick.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.americanmuseum.org/default.cfm/loadindex.89|title=Folk Art|publisher=American Museum in Britain|accessdate=2009-09-11}}</ref>
