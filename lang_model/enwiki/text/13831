==Background==
Scruton is better known as a writer and philosopher, and is largely self-taught as a composer.<ref>Scruton (n.d.)</ref> ''Violet'' is the second of Scruton's two operas - it was preceded by the one-act ''The Minister'' (1998).<ref>Review by Hilary West in ''[[The Times]]'', 6 May 1998, cited in Scruton (n.d.)</ref> It is based on the life of the [[harpsichord|harpsichordist]] Violet Gordon-Woodhouse, who is described in [[Grove Music Online]] as follows: "A woman of wealth and social standing (somewhat imperilled by her irregular private life), she did not lead a very active public professional life, but made a considerable impression on the intellectual and artistic circles of the day".<ref>Salter (n.d.)</ref> The composer has written "In Violet<U+2019>s world high culture, eccentric life-style, and aristocratic manners achieved a never-to-be-repeated synthesis. And when that world was swept away by the First World War, a part of the English soul was lost".<ref name=Scruton>Scruton (2013)</ref> According to the programme note of the premiere performance, ''Violet'' epitomises "the sad magnificence of human folly".<ref name=Conway>Conway (2005)</ref>

The cast of the opera includes Violet, her husband Gordon (with whom she had a ''[[mariage blanc]]'') and a circle of relatives and friends including the [[lesbian]] composer [[Ethel Smyth]] (whose role is sung by a male [[baritone]]) and three of Violet's male admirers.<ref name=Conway/> The score includes a number of references to music of other composers, including [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]], [[Richard Wagner|Wagner]] and [[Johann Sebastian Bach|JS Bach]], as well as to [[folk music|folksong]].<ref name=Scruton/>

==Synopsis==
The opera is set at the Woodhouses's home, [[Nether Lypiatt Manor|Lypiatt Manor]] at [[Nether Lypiatt]]. Jessica (in the present day), reading her great-aunt's papers, recreates the [[Edwardian era|Edwardian]] world of Violet and her five 'husbands' - Gordon, Ethel Smyth, Max Labouchere, Bill Barrington (later 10th [[Viscount Barrington]]) and Dennis Tollemache, who lived there in a sexless 'm<U+00E9>nage-<U+00E0>-cinq', in which, in the composer's words "love means purity and passion stops at the garden gate".<ref name=Scruton/> The characters extol Violet and dine together. In the second act we learn that Max has died in the trenches in [[World War I]]. Jessica, regretting what she sees as the loss of an innocent world, decides to sell the house.<ref name=Conway/>
