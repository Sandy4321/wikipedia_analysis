"'''My Hometown'''" is a single by [[Bruce Springsteen]] off of his ''[[Born in the U.S.A.]]'' album, that was the [[Most Hot 100 hit singles from an album|record-tying seventh and last top 10 single]] to come from it, peaking at #6 on the [[Billboard Hot 100]] singles chart. It also topped the U.S. [[Hot Adult Contemporary Tracks|adult contemporary chart]], making the song Springsteen's only #1 song on this chart to date.<ref>[[Joel Whitburn|Whitburn, Joel]] (1996). The Billboard Book of Top 40 Hits, 6th Edition (Billboard Publications)</ref> The song is a [[synthesizer]]-based, low-tempo number that features Springsteen on vocals.

==Lyrics==
The song<U+2019>s lyrics begin with the speaker<U+2019>s memories of his father instilling pride in the family<U+2019>s hometown.  While it first appears that the song will be a nostalgic look at the speaker<U+2019>s childhood, the song then goes on to describe the racial violence and economic depression that he witnessed as an adolescent and middle-aged man.  The song concludes with the speaker<U+2019>s proclamation that he hopes to move his family out of the town.

Some of the song's images derive directly from Springsteen's experiences growing up in [[Freehold Borough, New Jersey]], in particular the [[New Jersey#Twentieth century|racial strife in 1960s New Jersey]] and economic tensions from the same times (the "textile mill being closed" was the A & M [[Karagheusian Rug Mill]] at Center and Jackson Streets of Freehold).

==Analysis==
"My Hometown" stands in contrast to songs like [[John Mellencamp]]<U+2019>s <U+201C>Small Town,<U+201D> which tend to romanticize the struggles of growing up in rural America.  Additionally, "My Hometown" is perhaps a clearer representation of the themes presented in the title track of the album it originated from.  While "[[Born in the U.S.A. (song)|Born in the U.S.A.]]" is a more bombastic tune, its mistrust of blind patriotism and nostalgia is often lost on listeners.  Such ideas are more easily audible in "My Hometown."

==Music video==
The [[music video]] for "My Hometown" was a straightforward video filming of a performance of the song at a Springsteen and [[E Street Band]] concert late in the [[Born in the U.S.A. Tour]], eschewing fast-paced cutting for slower montages of Springsteen and various band members.  Despite its lack of visual excitement, it still managed substantial [[MTV]] airplay.

==Track listing==
#My Hometown - 4:33
#[[Santa Claus Is Comin' to Town]] - 4:27

The B-side of the single, "[[Santa Claus Is Comin' to Town]]", was a semi-comical live recording of the Christmas fave from a Springsteen and E Street Band concert on [[December 12]], [[1975]] at [[C. W. Post College]] on [[Long Island, New York]].  Long familiar to Springsteen fans from its distribution years earlier to rock radio stations, it had previously been released on the fairly unknown 1981 children's album ''[[In Harmony|In Harmony 2]]''; now in time for the Christmas season it was being issued again.  Always a radio favorite, Bruce's "Santa Claus" would benefit from the all-holiday-music-all-time-time formats of the 2000s, and during the 2005 holiday season "Santa Claus" would appear on the Billboard [[Top 40 Adult Recurrents]] and [[Hot Digital Songs]] charts.

==Live performance history==
"My Hometown" was a staple selection on the Born in the U.S.A. Tour, in an arrangement very similar to the album.  Springsteen sometimes preceded the song with a story about the tall veterans' monument in front of the courthouse in Freehold; later in the tour he announced gifts to local food banks, union funds, and related activities before playing the song.

"My Hometown" was omitted during the 1988 [[Tunnel of Love Express Tour]], but then appeared at all twenty performances on that year's later [[Human Rights Now! Tour]], where it saluted people trying to take responsibility for their own freedom.  It has been played on and off on Springsteen's various tours ever since; it is part of the repertoire of songs that Springsteen pulls out on a given night when he thinks it fits the theme or mood of a concert or location.
