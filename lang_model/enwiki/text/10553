'''''Irreemplazable''''' is the first [[extended play]] (EP) by American recording artist [[Beyonc<U+00E9> Knowles]]. Featuring [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[English language|English]] and [[Spanglish]] re-recordings of songs from her second [[studio album]] ''[[B'Day]]'', it featured as a bonus disc for the deluxe edition of ''B'Day'', before being released separately on August 28, 2007 by [[Columbia Records]]. Copies purchased from [[Wal-mart]] also contain a [[DVD]] featuring Knowles' concert and television performances and behind-the-scenes footage.

''Irreemplazable'' received a mixed review from [[Allmusic]]'s Andy Kellman, who criticized its lack of content and the fact that the EP was released several months after the deluxe edition of ''B'Day''. ''Irreemplazable'' peaked at number 105 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]], and has sold 57,000 copies in the United States. It also appeared on the [[Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums]], the [[Top Latin Albums]] and the [[Latin Pop Albums]] charts.

==Background and promotion==
Growing up in [[Houston, Texas]], Knowles was surrounded by the [[Spanish language]], and learnt some Spanish as a child, which she later forgot. When re-recording songs for ''Irreemplazable'', Knowles' vocal coach provided the Spanish lyrics phoenetically, and each line was recorded up to four times for the EP. Knowles has stated that she intends to take up Spanish lessons in the future.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://spanish.about.com/b/2007/04/05/beyonc-adds-spanish-tracks-to-hit-album.htm |title=Beyonc<U+00E9> adds Spanish tracks to hit album |first=Gerald |last=Erichsen |publisher=[[About.com]]. [[The New York Times Company]] |date=April 5, 2007 |accessdate=April 14, 2011}}</ref> She said of the EP's recording, "This is such an honor for me to be able to connect with all my fans. I had so much fun singing in Spanish. It reminded me of growing up in Houston".<ref>{{cite press release |url=http://www.hispanicprwire.com/news.php?l=in&id=9164 |title=Beyonc<U+00E9> has a Special Gift for MTV Tr3s Fans |publisher=[[Music World Entertainment]] |date=August 1, 2007 |location=New York |accessdate=April 28, 2011}}</ref> ''[[The Denver Post]]''{{'s}} John Wenzel interpreted the release of ''Irreemplazable'' as "an effort to meet the exploding market for Spanish language music".<ref name="marketing"/>

''Irreemplazable'' was released as the bonus disc on the ''[[B'Day]]'' deluxe edition, on April 3, 2007,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.amazon.com/Bday-Deluxe-Beyonce/dp/B000NDIAWO/ref=dp_return_1?ie=UTF8&n=5174&s=music |title=B'day &#91;Deluxe Edition&#93; |publisher=[[Amazon.com]] |accessdate=April 14, 2011}}</ref> before being released separately by [[Columbia Records]] on August 28, 2007.<ref name="Ayala">{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.biz/bbbiz/content_display/genre/news/e3i590ca1c25f7cbb36795c3cdbea3208ee |title=Beyonce To Release 'Irreemplazable' As Wal-Mart Exclusive |first=Ayala |last=Ben-Yehuda |location=[[Los Angeles]] |work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |publisher=[[Nielsen Business Media]] |date=July 31, 2007 |accessdate=April 14, 2011}}</ref> However, a remix of "[[Get Me Bodied]]" was available only on the individual release of ''Irreemplazable''.

Knowles appeared on [[Tr3s (TV network)|Tr3s]]' [[Total Request Live|''Mi TRL'']] on August 2 and showed a behind-the-scenes special, "Making of the Spanish EP".<ref name="Ayala"/>

==Composition==
''Irreemplazable'' opens with "[[Amor Gitano]]", a duet with [[Alejandro Fern<U+00E1>ndez]] originally from Fern<U+00E1>ndez' fifteenth studio album, ''[[Viento a Favor (Alejandro Fern<U+00E1>ndez album)|Viento a Favor]]''. "[[Listen (song)|Listen]]", a theme song from ''[[Dreamgirls (film)|Dreamgirls]]'', in which Knowles appears, was re-recorded under the title "Oye". The EP's title track is a Spanish version of "[[Irreplaceable]]", a song that was highly successful in its English recording.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/#/song/beyonce/irreplaceable/8195717 |title=Irreplaceable <U+2013> Beyonc<U+00E9> |work=Billboard |publisher=Prometheus Global Media |accessdate=April 14, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://hitparade.ch/showitem.asp?interpret=Beyonc%E9&titel=Irreplaceable&cat=s |title=Beyonc<U+00E9> <U+2013> Irreplaceable |publisher=Hitparade.ch. Hung Medien |accessdate=April 14, 2011}}</ref> Three recordings of "[[Beautiful Liar]]" appear on ''Irreemplazable'': a Spanish version (titled "Bello Embustero"), a remixed English version and a [[Spanglish]] version. A [[norte<U+00F1>o (music)|norte<U+00F1>a]] remix of "Irreemplazable" is the EP's seventh track, while [[Timbaland]]'s remix of "Get Me Bodied", which features [[rapping|vocals]] from [[Voltio]], closes ''Irreemplazable''. An exclusive [[DVD]] accompanied the EP in [[Wal-mart]] stores, containing behind-the-scenes footage and taped performances from [[The Beyonc<U+00E9> Experience]] and Knowles' appearance on ''[[The Early Show]]'', as well as a [[documentary]] named "La Evoluci<U+00F3>n Latina de Beyonc<U+00E9>" ("The Latin Evolution of Beyonc<U+00E9>").<ref name="marketing">{{cite web|url=http://www.denverpost.com/ci_6641812 |title=Marketing's child: Beyonc<U+00E9> |first=John |last=Wenzel |work=[[The Denver Post]] |publisher=[[MediaNews Group]] |date=August 19, 2007 |accessdate=April 14, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.walmart.com/ip/6486785 |title=Irreemplazable (with Exclusive Bonus DVD) |publisher=[[Wal-mart]] |accessdate=April 14, 2011}}</ref>

==Reception==
Giving it two and a half stars, Andy Kellman of [[Allmusic]] said that "there's not that much to the disc," and alleged that it was unnecessary, concluding "if you're a die-hard Beyonc<U+00E9> fan, you'll probably feel jerked around a bit <U+2014> especially if you bought ''B'Day'' when it came out in September 2006 and bought the deluxe edition seven months later, only to find out that the bonus material would later come out on its own (with a track not on the second disc of the deluxe edition!)." Kellman selected "Amor Gitano", "Irreemplazable" and the "Get Me Bodied" remix as the highlights of the EP.<ref>{{Allmusic|class=album|id=r1087822 |tab=review|accessdate=April 14, 2011|first=Andy|last=Kellman}}</ref>
