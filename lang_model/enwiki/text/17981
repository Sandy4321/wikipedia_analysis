'''Suffolk County Community College''' ('''SCCC''') is a two-year public college on [[Long Island]], [[New York|NY]] sponsored by [[State University of New York|SUNY]] and [[Suffolk County, New York]] in the [[United States|USA]]. 

Founded in 1959, Suffolk County Community College has three main campuses in Selden, Brentwood and Riverhead. It also has two "satellite" centers in Sayville and downtown Riverhead.

The school was founded largely through the efforts of Albert Ammerman (1914-November 26, 2008) who was the school's President from its founding December 1959 until 1983. In its first year it had 13 faculty with 171 full time students at the [[Sachem School District|Sachem High School]] in  Ronkonkoma and 335 part time students at [[Riverhead High School]] until what is now called the Ammerman campus opened in 1962 in the former Suffolk County Tuberculosis Sanatorium (originally built in 1912). By 1977 it had opened a campus in Riverhead and one on the edge of the [[Pilgrim Psychiatric Center]] in Brentwood.<ref>[http://www.newsday.com/long-island/suffolk/heart-spirit-soul-of-sccc-dies-at-94-1.883897 'Heart, spirit, soul' of SCCC dies at 94 - Newsday - November 27, 2008]</ref>

The Ammerman campus at [[Selden, New York|Selden]] opened in 1961. It is the largest, first, and main campus of Suffolk County Community College. Located off of [[Nicolls Road]] it has become a landmark of [[Suffolk County, New York|Suffolk County]]. The main campus is the home to the majority of the sports teams as well. The site was previously a tuberculosis sanitarium.<ref name="The Times Beacon Record">{{cite news | url=http://www.northshoreoflongisland.com/Articles-i-2006-10-26-60381.112114_SCC_site_was_once_a_verdant_sanatorium.html | title=SCC site was once a verdant sanatorium | publisher=''[[The Times Beacon Record]]'' | date=Oct. 27, 2006 | accessdate=June 17, 2009}}</ref>

'''DESCRIPTION:'''The Honors Program at Suffolk County Community College is a program for intelligent and motivated students.

Honors courses are available in many disciplines. The courses are taught by highly qualified and respected faculty, who tailor the class to fit the student<U+2019>s capabilities. The maximum capacity per Honors course is 22 students although they often run with fewer.  If enrolled in these courses, one can expect to meet other highly motivated students, engage regularly in classroom discussions, and do more in-depth coursework. 

'''LOCATION:'''The Honors Program is offered on all three of Suffolk County Community College<U+2019>s campuses (Grant, Ammerman, and East). 

'''OPPORTUNITIES:'''On each campus, there are Honors counselors who assist students in making their schedules at Suffolk County Community College and help them through the transferring process.

'''REQUIREMENTS:'''Entering students will be invited into the Honors Program based on their high school achievements. A B+ average and a composite SAT score of 1650 are required.
