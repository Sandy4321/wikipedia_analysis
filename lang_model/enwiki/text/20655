Born in [[Oslo]] as a daughter of [[Gudmund Harlem]], Brundtland was educated as a Medical Doctor ([[cand.med.]]) at the [[University of Oslo]] in 1963, and [[Master of Public Health]] at [[Harvard University]] in 1965. From 1966 to 1969, she worked as a physician at the [[Norwegian Directorate for Health and Social Affairs|Directorate of Health]] (''Helsedirektoratet''), and from 1969 she worked as a doctor in Oslo's public school health service. She was [[Minister of the Environment (Norway)|Norwegian Minister for Environmental Affairs]] from 1974 to 1979, and became Norway's first <U+2014> and to date only <U+2014> female [[List of Norwegian Prime Ministers|Prime Minister]]. She  served as Prime Minister from February to October in 1981. 

Brundtland became Norwegian Prime Minister for two subsequent terms from 9 May 1986 until 16 October 1989 (This cabinet was internationally renowned for its large percentage of female ministers. Eight of the eighteen total were female) and from 3 November 1990 until 25 October 1996, when she resigned and retired from Norwegian politics, and was succeeded by [[Thorbj<U+00F8>rn Jagland]].

==International career==
In 1983, Brundtland was invited by then [[United Nations Secretary-General]] [[Javier P<U+00E9>rez de Cu<U+00E9>llar]] to establish and chair the [[World Commission on Environment and Development]] (WCED), widely referred to as the [[Brundtland Commission]], developing the broad political concept of [[sustainable development]] in the course of extensive public hearings that were distinguished by their inclusiveness and published its report ''[[Our Common Future]]'' in April 1987. The Brundtland Commission provided the momentum for the 1992 [[Earth Summit]]/[[UNCED]], that was headed by [[Maurice Strong]], who had been a prominent member of the Brundtland Commission. The Brundtland Commission also provided momentum for [[Agenda 21]]. 

Brundtland was elected Director-General of the [[World Health Organization]] in May 1998. In this capacity, Brundtland adopted a far-reaching approach to public health, establishing a [[Commission on Macroeconomics and Health]], chaired by [[Jeffrey Sachs]], and addressing [[violence]] as a major public health issue. Brundtland spearheaded the movement, now worldwide, to achieve the abolition of [[Tobacco smoking|cigarette smoking]] by education and persuasion. 

Under her leadership, the World Health Organization was one of the first major employers to require freedom from tobacco addiction as a condition of employment. Brundtland was recognized in 2003 by [[Scientific American]] as their ''Policy Leader of the Year'' for coordinating a rapid worldwide response to stem outbreaks of [[Severe acute respiratory syndrome|SARS]]. Brundtland was succeeded on 21 July 2003 by [[Jong-Wook Lee]]. In 1994. Brundtland was awarded the [[Karlspreis|Charlemagne Prize]] of the city of [[Aachen]].

In 2004 the British newspaper ''[[The Financial Times]]'' listed Brundtland the 4th most influential European over the last 25 years, behind [[Pope John Paul II]], [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] and [[Margaret Thatcher]]. {{Fact|date=March 2008}}

In 2006 Brundtland was a member of the Panel of Eminent Persons who reviewed the work of [[UNCTAD]] (United Nations Conference on Trade and Development.) In May 2007, the UN Secretary-General [[Ban Ki-moon]] named Brundtland, as well as [[Ricardo Lagos]] (the former [[president of Chile]]), and [[Han Seung-soo]] (the former foreign minister of [[South Korea]]), to serve as UN Special Envoys for Climate Change.<ref>[http://www.guardian.co.uk/uslatest/story/0,,-6623190,00.html U.N. Envoys Seek Input on Climate Change], ''The Guardian'', 10 May 2007</ref>

==The Elders==
On 18 July 2007 in [[Johannesburg]], [[South Africa]], [[Nelson Mandela]], [[Gra<U+00E7>a Machel]], and [[Desmond Tutu]] convened a group of world leaders to contribute their wisdom, independent leadership and integrity to tackle some of the world's toughest problems. Nelson Mandela announced the formation of this new group, [[Global Elders|The Elders]], in a speech he delivered on the occasion of his 89th birthday. 

Archbishop Tutu will serve as the Chair of The Elders. The founding members of this group include Brundtland, [[Gra<U+00E7>a Machel]], [[Kofi Annan]], [[Ela Bhatt]], [[Jimmy Carter]], [[Li Zhaoxing]], [[Mary Robinson]] and [[Muhammad Yunus]].

<U+201C>This group can speak freely and boldly, working both publicly and behind the scenes on whatever actions need to be taken,<U+201D> Mandela commented. <U+201C>Together we will work to support courage where there is fear, foster agreement where there is conflict, and inspire hope where there is despair.<U+201D>

The Elders will be independently funded by a group of Founders, including [[Richard Branson]], [[Peter Gabriel]], [[Ray Chambers]]; Michael Chambers; Bridgeway Foundation; [[Pam Omidyar]], Humanity United; Amy Robbins; [[Shashi Ruia]], Dick Tarlow; and [[The United Nations Foundation]].

==Controversy over cancer treatment payments==
Brundtland received an operation for [[uterine cancer]] in 2002 at [[Ullev<U+00E5>l University Hospital]]<ref>{{no icon}} [http://www.vg.no/nyheter/innenriks/norsk-politikk/artikkel.php?artid=508236 VG.no:Betalte operasjon i 2002]</ref>. In 2008 it became known that during 2007 she had received two treatments at Ullev<U+00E5>l, paid for by Norwegian public expenditures. Since she had previously notified the Norwegian authorities that she had changed residence to [[France]], she was no longer entitled to benefits of Norwegian [[social security]]. Following intense media attention surrounding the matter, Brundtland decided to change residence once more, back to Norway, and she also announced that she would be paying for the treatments herself.<ref>{{no icon}}[http://www.vg.no/nyheter/innenriks/artikkel.php?artid=509666 VG.no:Gro flytter hjem]</ref>
