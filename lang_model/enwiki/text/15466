'''St. Pete Beach''' is a coastal city in [[Pinellas County, Florida|Pinellas County]], [[Florida]],  [[United States]] famous for its status as a tourist destination.  St. Pete Beach was formed from the Towns of [[Pass-a-Grille]], [[Don CeSar]], [[Belle Vista]], [[St. Petersburg Beach]] and unincorporated [[Pinellas County]].  At the time of its incorporation in 1957, its name was St. Petersburg Beach. However, just about everyone referred to it as 'St. Pete Beach' and, on March 9, 1994, locals voted to officially change the name to the shorter version to distinguish it from the [[St._Petersburg%2C_Florida|City of St. Petersburg]] a few miles to the east.  The population was 9,929 at the 2000 census. In [[2004]], the [[U.S. Census Bureau]] estimated the population at 10,027 [http://www.census.gov/popest/cities/tables/SUB-EST2004-04-12.xls].
