She won a bronze medal for the [[Unified Team]] at the [[1992 Summer Olympics]] in the 4x100 m medley relay. 

After the [[1996 Summer Olympics|Atlanta Games]] in [[1996]] she was banned from competition after the detected use of a banned substance ([[bromantan]]). Zhivanevskaya returned in competition in 1999, and won the bronze medal in the 100 m Backstroke a year later at the [[2000 Summer Olympics]] in [[Sydney, Australia]].
