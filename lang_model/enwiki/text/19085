'''Seton Hall University''' is a [[Private university|private]] [[Catholicism|Roman Catholic]] [[university]] in [[South Orange, New Jersey]]. Founded in [[1856]] by Archbishop [[James Roosevelt Bayley]], Seton Hall is the oldest diocesan university in the [[United States]].<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.ssrn.com/update/ern/ernjob/job272.html|title= Seton Hall University History |work= Social Science Research Network |date= [[2007]] |accessdate= 2007-04-04}}</ref> It is also the oldest and largest Catholic university in the State of New Jersey. The University is known for its [[basketball]] team, its [[WSOU-FM|radio station]], and its programs in [[business]], [[law]], [[education]], [[nursing]], and [[diplomacy]].

The University is made up of eight different schools and colleges with an undergraduate enrollment of about 5,200 students and a graduate enrollment of about 4,500. Its [[Seton Hall University School of Law|School of Law]], which is ranked as one of the [[Law school rankings#Law School 100|top]] law schools in the nation,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://law.shu.edu/administration/public_relations/press_releases/2006/usnews_rankings_06.htm|title= Graduate School Rankings |work= US News and World Report |date= [[2007]] |accessdate= 2007-04-04}}</ref> has an enrollment of about 1,200 students. The Seton Hall College of Medicine and Dentistry was acquired by the state in [[1965]], and is now the [[New Jersey Medical School]], part of the [[University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey]].


== History ==
===Early History===
Like many of America's Catholic universities, Seton Hall arose out of the [[Plenary Councils of Baltimore|Plenary Council of American Bishops]], held in Baltimore in [[1844]], with the goal of bringing Catholicism to higher education in order to help propagate the faith.<ref name="history">{{cite web |url= http://www.rcan.org/index.cfm?fuseaction=feature.display&feature_ID=105|title= Higher Education Seeks to Instill Knowledge and Faith|work= Archdiocese of Newark Website |date= [[2007]] |accessdate= 2008-01-04}}</ref> Seton Hall College was formally founded on [[September 1]],[[1856]] by Archdiocese of Newark Bishop [[James Roosevelt Bayley]], a cousin of President [[Theodore Roosevelt]]. Bishop Bayley named the institution after his aunt, Mother [[Elizabeth Ann Seton]], who was the first American-born Catholic [[saint]]. [[Image:Bayley.gif|thumb|left|140px|Founder Bishop [[James Roosevelt Bayley]].]] 

The main campus of the college was originally located in [[Madison, New Jersey]]. Reverend Bernard J. McQuaid served as the first college president (1856-1857, 1859-1868) and directed a staff of four diocesan clergy including Reverend Alfred Young, vice-president; Reverend Daniel Fisher (the second college president, 1857-1859) and five lay instructors. Initially, Seton Hall had only five students - Leo G. Thebaud, Louis and Alfred Boisaubin, Peter Meehan and John Moore. By the end of the first year, the student body had grown fivefold to 54. [[Image:Seton hall dorm.jpg |thumb|right|240px|Postcard showing Stafford Hall, one of the first dormitories, in the late [[19th century]].]]

By the 1860s, Seton Hall College was continuing its rapid growth and began to enroll more and more students each year. However, among other difficulties, several fires on campus slowed down the growth process. The first of several strange fires in the University's history occurred in [[1867]] which destroyed the college<U+2019>s first building. Two decades later in [[1886]] (March 9), another fire destroyed the university<U+2019>s main building.<ref name="history2">{{cite news |url= http://events.shu.edu/150/history.html |title= History of Seton Hall |first= Alan, et al |last= Delozier |work= Walsh Library Archives| accessdate= 2007-05-09}}</ref> In the 20th century, another campus fire burned down a classroom as well as several dormitory buildings in [[1909]].

During the [[19th century]], despite setbacks, financially tight times and the [[American Civil War]], the College continued to expand. Seton Hall opened a military science department (forerunner to the ROTC program) during the summer of [[1893]], but this program was ultimately disbanded during the [[Spanish-American War]].<ref name="history2"/> Perhaps one of the most pivotal events in the history of Seton Hall came in 1897 when [[Seton Hall Preparatory School|Seton Hall<U+2019>s preparatory]] (high school) and college (undergraduate) divisions were permanently separated.<ref>{{cite news |url= http://events.shu.edu/150/history.html |title= History of Seton Hall |first= Alan, et al |last= Delozier |work= Walsh Library Archives| accessdate= 2007-05-09}}</ref> By 1937, Seton Hall established a University College. This marked the first matriculation of women at Seton Hall. Seton Hall became fully coeducational in 1968. In 1948, Seton Hall was given a license by the [[Federal Communications Commission|FCC]] for [[WSOU-FM]]. Today, the station is one of the leading college radio stations in the country. [[Image:P5151461-m.jpg|thumb|right|240px|President's Hall is one of the university's oldest buildings.]]

The College was organized into a university in [[1950]] following an unprecedented growth in enrollment.  The College of Arts and Sciences and the schools of business, nursing and education comprised the University; the School of Law opened its doors in [[1951]], with Miriam Rooney as the first woman dean of law in the United States.<ref name="history"/> 

=== College of Medicine and Dentistry ===
The '''Seton Hall College of Medicine and Dentistry ''' was established in [[1954]] as the first medical school and dental school in New Jersey.  Although the College, set up under the auspices of the [[Archdiocese of Newark]], was a separate legal entity from the University, it had an interlocking Board of Trustees. The first class was enrolled in [[1956]].  The [[Jersey City Medical Center]] was used for clinical education.  The College was acquired by the state of New Jersey in [[1965]] and renamed the New Jersey College of Medicine and Dentistry (now [[University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey]]).<ref>[http://www.umdnj.edu/about/about03_history.htm About UMDNJ: History and Timeline], UMDNJ. Retrieved 2008-01-01.</ref>

The first medical school class graduated in [[1960]].  From [[1960]] to [[1964]], 348 individuals received an M.D. degree.  The dental school also awarded its first degrees in 1960.  The College was sold to the state of New Jersey for US$4 million after the Archdiocese of New Jersey could not support mounting school debt.<ref>[http://www.umdnj.edu/librweb/speccoll/SHCMD.html RECORD GROUP RG/A

=== Modernization Period ===
[[Image:P4100200-m.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Statue of St. Elizabeth Ann Seton.]]
Beginning in the late 1960s and continuing in the next two decades, the university saw the construction and modernization of a large number of facilities and the construction of the library, science building, residence halls and the University center. Many new programs and majors were inaugurated, as were important social outreach efforts. New ties were established with the private and industrial sectors, and a growing partnership developed with federal and state governments in creating programs for the economically and educationally disadvantaged. {{Fact|date=January 2008}}

The 1970s and 1980s continued to be a time of growth and renewal. New business and nursing classroom buildings and an art center were opened. In 1984, the Immaculate Conception Seminary returned to Seton Hall, its original home until 1926, when it moved to Darlington (a section of [[Mahwah, New Jersey|Mahwah]]). The Recreation Center was dedicated in 1987. With the construction of four new residence halls between 1986 to 1988, and the purchase of an off-campus apartment building in 1990, the University made significant changes to account for a larger number of student residents. Seton Hall is recognized as a residential campus, providing living space for approximately 2100 students.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://studentaffairs.shu.edu/housing/residencehalls.html|title=Housing Information|work= SHU Housing & Residence Life|date= [[2007]] |accessdate= 2008-01-04}}</ref> 

The physical development of the campus continued in the 1990s. The $20 million Walsh Library opened in 1994, and its first-class study and research resources marked the beginning of a technological transformation of Seton Hall. Kozlowski Hall, the University's newest academic center dedicated in 1997, is a clear example of Seton Hall's continued commitment to undergraduate education and the expanding role of information technology in higher education. The building was named after Seton Hall graduate [[Dennis Kozlowski]], who is notorious for allegedly stealing millions of dollars from [[Tyco]]. On [[July 18]] [[2005]], Kozlowski's name was removed from the building at his request, and it was subsequently renamed Jubilee Hall.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A0CE5DD103EF93AA2575BC0A9639C8B63&n=Top%2fReference%2fTimes%20Topics%2fOrganizations%2fS%2fSeton%20Hall%20University|title= New Jersey: South Orange: Convict's Name Off Building |work= New York Times |date= [[2007]] |accessdate= 2007-04-04}}</ref> All classrooms in this six-story, 126,000 square foot (12,000 m<U+00B2>) building are wired for network and Internet connections, and many of the lecture halls are equipped with distance-learning technology. Its recreation center was originally named after Robert Brennan, but he was found guilty of securities fraud in [[1994]].  It has since been renamed for long-time athletic director [[Richie Regan]]. A new School of Law building and parking garage were also constructed in the 1990s. Seton Hall continues to be a leader in technology in education, as well as in distance learning, with its renowned Seton World Wide program. In 1998, all incoming full-time, first-year students were issued laptop computers as part of the University's innovative and nationally recognized mobile computing program.

=== Boland Hall Fire ===
{{main|Boland Hall Fire}}
On [[January 19]], [[2000]], an arson fire killed three and injured 54 students in Boland Hall, a freshman [[dormitory]] on the campus in [[South Orange, New Jersey|South Orange]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cnn.com/2000/US/01/19/seton.hall.fire.03/|title= Three Die in Dorm Fire at Seton Hall |work= CNN News |date= [[2000]] |accessdate= 2007-05-09}}</ref> The incident, one of the deadliest in recent US history, occurred at 4:30am, when most students were asleep.  After a three-and-a-half year investigation, a 60-count [[indictment]] charged two freshmen students, Sean Ryan and Joseph LePore, with starting the fire and [[felony murder]] for the deaths which resulted.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cnn.com/2006/LAW/11/15/student.arson/index.html |title= Former students reach plea deal in killer dorm fire |work= CNN News |date= [[2007]] |accessdate= 2007-04-04}}</ref>  LePore and Ryan pled guilty to third-degree [[arson]] and were sentenced to five years in a youth correctional facility with eligibility for parole in 16 months.

=== ''Ever Forward'' Campaign ===
[[Image:SHUchapel.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Immaculate Conception Chapel was built during the [[American Civil War]].]] Seton Hall alumni and community, on the 150th anniversary (1856-2006) of the university<U+2019>s founding, initiated the Ever Forward capital campaign to raise a total of $150 million.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://everforward.shu.edu/about/index.htm
|title= Ever Forward Campaign Description |work= Seton Hall University Website |date= [[2007]] |accessdate= 2007-04-04}}</ref> The campaign is one of the most prestigious building campaigns in the University<U+2019>s long history. The funds will go to many areas throughout the university, however, a majority will go to building and reconstructing campus facilities and historic sites. [[Image:Chapelfront.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Immaculate Conception Chapel shown here after undergoing renovations.]]

Among the most notable objectives of the campaign, there will be a new site and complex for the University<U+2019>s [[John C. Whitehead School of Diplomacy and International Relations|Whitehead School of Diplomacy]]. The University Center is also being planned to be rebuilt in a [[neo-gothic]] style to match other university buildings. Most recently, the rebuilding of the University<U+2019>s Science and Technology Center has already taken place as of 2005. It is expect to be completed in the summer of 2007.
In Fall 2007, the university opened a new 35 million dollar Science and Technology Center, completing one of the major campaign priorities ahead of schedule. On 17 December 2007, the university announced that the campaign's fund raising goals had been met and exceeded over two weeks ahead of the campaign's scheduled closing date. <ref>http://www.shu.edu/events/ever-forward.cfm?cm_sp=University%20Advancement-_-Ever%20Forward%20Completion-_-Without%20Photos</ref>

[[Image:Shucollegemap.jpg|thumb|left|200px|A map from 1885 showing the Seton Hall College campus within the [[South Orange]] Village lines.]] The main campus of Seton Hall University is situated on 58 suburban acres (230,000 m<U+00B2>) on South Orange Avenue and is home to seven of the eight schools and colleges of the University. The [[South Orange|South Orange Village]] center is located just <U+00BD> mile south of the main campus. Directly across from the main campus to the west are scenic Montrose Park and the Montrose Park Historic District, which is listed in the [[National Register of Historic Places]]. <ref>{{cite news |url= http://www.archiplanet.org/wiki/Montrose_Park_Historic_District |title= Montrose Park Historic District|work= Archiplanet| accessdate= 2008-01-03}}</ref> The Village itself dates back to [[1666]] preceding the establishment of Seton Hall College. <ref>{{cite news |url= http://www.southorange.org/history.asp |title= The South Orange Village History|work= South Orange Village Website| accessdate= 2008-01-03}}</ref> Since the beginning of the College, the [[South Orange (NJT station) |South Orange Rail Station]] has served as an integral means to campus commuters. The main campus combines different architectural styles including [[Roman]], [[neo-gothic]] and [[modern]].  The South Orange campus became a gated community during the University<U+2019>s Modernization Period. 

===Newark Campus=== 
A satellite of the main campus, the Newark Campus is home to the University<U+2019>s [[Seton Hall University School of Law| School of Law]]. Located at One Newark Center, the Law School and several academic centers of the University are housed in a modern 22-story [[skyscraper]] building. It is located at the corner of Raymond Boulevard and McCarter Highway in [[Newark, New Jersey]] and was completed in [[1991]]. The Newark Campus building provides 210,000 square feet and an additional 65,000 square feet of library to the University. <ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.emporis.com/en/wm/bu/?id=1newarkcenter-newark-nj-usa|title= One Newark Center |work= Emporis Worldwide Listing |date= [[2006]] |accessdate= 2008-01-03}}</ref>

The Seton Hall University School of Law founded in [[1951]]. It is accredited by the [[American Bar Association]] (ABA) since 1951 and is also a member of the [[Association of American Law Schools]] (AALS). Seton Hall is one of three law schools in the state of New Jersey. [[Image:Onenewarkcenter.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Seton Hall School of Law in Newark, NJ]]

In 2007 and 2008, the ''[[U.S. News and World Report]]'' ranked the school ''70th'' among the top 100 law schools in the nation. Its [[Health Law]] program, which also offers an [[L.L.M.]] degree, is ranked ''4th'' in the nation.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://law.shu.edu/administration/public_relations/press_releases/2006/usnews_rankings_06.htm|title= Graduate School Rankings |work= US News and World Report |date= [[2007]] |accessdate= 2007-04-04}}</ref> The school was also ranked as having one of the highest rates of employment at graduation placing ''19th'' with 92.1% (and 97% after nine months).<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.ilrg.com/rankings/law/index.php/1/desc/EmployGrad |title= 2007 Raw Law School Data <U+2013> Employment at Graduation |work= Internet Legal Research Group |date= [[2007]] |accessdate= 2007-04-07}}</ref>

===Buildings===
The original centerpieces of the campus were made up of three buildings built in the 19th century. The President<U+2019>s, Stafford and Marshall Hall were built when the College moved from [[Madison, New Jersey]] to [[South Orange]]. Some of the more notable buildings on campus are: 

* '''Presidents Hall''' <U+2013> One the oldest buildings on campus and a flagship of the University, President<U+2019>s Hall was completed in [[1867]]. <ref name="buildings">{{cite web | url = http://www.sohps.org/seton_hall_history%20walking_tour.htm| title = University Day Historical Walking Tour of Seton Hall University Facts| publisher = South Orange Historical and Preservation Society | accessdate = 2008-01-03}}</ref> Located and the epicenter of the main campus, President<U+2019>s Hall is a [[neo-gothic]] structure dressed in [[brownstone]]. It originally served as a seminary but now houses the University<U+2019>s administration including the Office of the University President. The halls are lined with many portraits of past University presidents and includes a large [[stained glass]] depicting [[Saint Elizabeth Ann Seton]], which was commissioned in [[1866]] by President Bayley.

* '''McQuaid Hall''' <U+2013> Built around [[1900]], it was named for Bishop Bernard J. McQuaid, Seton Hall<U+2019>s first President from 1856-1857 and 1859-1867.<ref name="buildings"/> McQuaid Hall was both a boarding house for students and a convent for nuns before serving its present purpose as the home of the [[John C. Whitehead School of Diplomacy and International Relations]] as well as the Graduate School of Medical Education.  

* '''Jubilee Hall''' <U+2013> Originally named Kozlowski Hall, the building was renamed Jubilee Hall in honor of the [[Jubilee|Papal Jubilee]]. As one of the newer additions to the main campus, it was built in 1997. Jubilee Hall houses the [[W. Paul Stillman School of Business]] in addition to the largest [[auditorium]] at the University. There are also several computer labs, state-of-the-art classrooms and a Stock Exchange research room.

* '''[[Walsh Gymnasium]]''' is a multi-purpose [[arena]] for University Sports. The arena opened in [[1939]] and can seat 2,600 people. <ref name="buildings"/> It was home to the Seton Hall University Pirates men's [[basketball]] team before they moved to [[Continental Airlines Arena]] and then the [[Prudential Center]].  Currently, the arena hosts the women's [[basketball]] and [[volleyball]] teams, and is part of the Richie Regan Recreation and Athletic Center.  The building, like the school's main library, is named for His Excellency, the Right Rev. Thomas J. Walsh, S.T.D., J.U.D., Fifth Bishop of Newark and former President of the Board of Trustees.

* '''Fahy Hall''' <U+2013> Built in [[1968]], the building currently houses the classrooms and faculty offices of the College of Arts and Sciences. <ref name="buildings"/> The building was named after Msgr. Thomas Fahy who served as President of the University from [[1970]]-[[1976]]. Fahy Hall also includes several student resources and facilities. Among these, the main facilities are two television studios and two amphitheaters. There are also several [[laboratories]]: computer labs, language learning labs and statistics labs. 

* '''Arts and Sciences Hall''' <U+2013> Originally built to house the Stillman School of Business in [[1973]], with the creation of Jubilee Hall in [[1997]], the building is now home to the College of Arts and Sciences. <ref name="buildings"/> The University<U+2019>s [[African Studies|Center for African Studies]] is also located here. The Arts and Sciences building is also conjoined with the College of Nursing in the north wing. The College of Nursing has advanced teaching facilities including hospital beds, demonstration rooms and multi-purpose practice areas.

* '''McNulty Hall''' <U+2013> Named for Msgr. John L. McNulty, President of the University from [[1949]]-[[1959]], McNulty Hall was built as a the university<U+2019>s technology and research center in [[1954]]. <ref name="buildings"/> One of the most famous features of the building is the <U+201C>Atom Wall<U+201D> a relief artwork originally located on outer fa<U+00E7>ade. Following renovations completed in the summer of [[2007]], the Atom Wall, depicting the gift scientific knowledge from God to man, can be seen in the glass atrium of the building. <ref name="buildings"/> McNulty also houses a large amphitheater and observatory for the [[chemistry]], [[physics]] and [[biology]] departments.

== Traditions ==
*'''University Seal''' <U+2013> The University seal as it is today is symbolic of hundreds of years of history. The seal combines attributes from the Bayley [[Coat of Arms]] and the [[Seton (surname)|Seton]] family crest. The Seton crest dates back as early as [[1216]] and symbolizes [[History of Scotland|Scottish nobility]]. Renowned crest-maker, William F. J. Ryan designed the current form of the Seton Hall crest which is notable for its three [[crescents]] and three [[torteau]].<ref>{{cite news |url= http://pirate.shu.edu/~wisterro/Medallion/index.htm |title= Saints, Monsters, Bishops and Seton Hall |first= Msgr. Robert |last= Wister |work= mimeo| accessdate= 2007-05-09}}</ref> The motto on the seal ''Hazard Zet Forward'' (Hazard Zit Forward on some versions) is a combination of [[Norman French]] and archaic English meaning ''at whatever risk, yet go forward''.<ref>Ibid.</ref> Part custom and part superstition, students avoid stepping on an engraving of the seal in the middle of the university green. It is said that students who step on the seal will not graduate.  

*'''Alma Mater''' <U+2013> The lyrics were written by Charles A. Byrne (SH '37) ''To Alma Mater all be loyal, keep her name in purest light. Never waver from her precepts, guard her banner blue and white. O sing her praise to highest skies and be ye faithful in her eyes, for she will foster all your dreams, her name is Seton Hall. When on life's hard stones you stumble, pray to God to be your guide. Think of Seton Hall your mother, then forge on in steady stride. O sing her praise to highest skies, and be ye faithful in her eyes, for she will foster all your dreams, her name is Seton Hall.''<ref>{{cite news |title= Alma Mater lyrics|work= 2007 Commencement Exercises Pamphlet| accessdate= 2007-05-09}}</ref>
