The '''olm''', or '''proteus''' ('''''Proteus anguinus'''''), is a blind [[amphibian]] [[Endemism|endemic]] to the subterranean waters of caves of the [[Dinaric Alps|Dinaric]] [[Karst topography|karst]] of southern Europe. It lives in the waters that flow underground through this extensive limestone region including waters of the [[So<U+010D>a]] river basin near [[Trieste]] in [[Italy]], through to southern [[Slovenia]], southwestern [[Croatia]], and [[Herzegovina]].<ref name="Sket1997">{{cite journal| author=Sket B. |year=1997 |title=Distribution of ''Proteus'' (Amphibia: Urodela: Proteidae) and its possible explanation |journal=Journal of Biogeography |volume=24 |issue=3 |pages=263-280 |doi=10.1046/j.1365-2699.1997.00103.x}}</ref> The olm is the only [[species]] in its [[genus]] ''Proteus'', the only [[Europe]]an species of the [[family (biology)|family]] [[Proteidae]], and the only European exclusively [[Troglobite|cave-dwelling]] [[chordate]]. It is also occasionally called the "human fish" by locals because of its skin color, similar to that of [[white people]] (translated literally from {{lang-sl|<U+010D>love<U+0161>ka ribica}} and {{lang-hr|<U+010D>ovje<U+010D>ja ribica}}), as well as "cave [[salamander]]" or "white salamander."<ref name="istria">[http://www.istrianet.org/istria/fauna/amphibians/proteus-anguinus1.htm Istria on the Internet &ndash; Proteus anguinus (Olm)]. Retrieved on 7 June 2007.</ref> In Slovenia it is also known by the name ''mo<U+010D>eril'', which translates as "the one that burrows into wetness."<ref>[[Ross Piper|Piper, Ross]] (2007), ''Extraordinary Animals: An Encyclopedia of Curious and Unusual Animals'', [[Greenwood Press (publisher)|Greenwood Press]].</ref>

This animal is most notable for its adaptations to a life of complete darkness in its underground habitat.  The olm's [[eye]]s are [[Vestigiality|undeveloped]], leaving it blind, while its other [[sense]]s, particularly those of [[olfaction|smell]] and [[hearing (sense)|hearing]], are acutely developed. It also lacks any [[biological pigment|pigmentation]] in its [[skin]]. In contrast to most amphibians, the olm is entirely [[aquatic animal|aquatic]], and it eats, sleeps, and breeds underwater. It has 3 toes on its forelimbs, but 2 toes on its hind feet. It also exhibits [[neoteny]], retaining [[larva]]l characteristics like external [[gill]]s into adulthood, <ref name="animal">{{cite book |author=Burnie D. & Wilson D.E. (eds.) |title=Animal |publisher=DK |location=London |year=2001 |pages=61, 435 |isbn=0-7894-7764-5 |oclc= |doi=}}</ref> like the American amphibians, the [[axolotl]] and the  [[mud puppy]].

==Anatomy==
===External appearance===
The olm's body is [[snake]]like, 20&ndash;30&nbsp;cm (8&ndash;12&nbsp;in) long, with some specimens reaching up to {{convert|40|cm|in|0}}.<ref name="WEB01">Weber A. (2000). ''Fish and amphibia''. In: Culver D.C. ''et al.'' (ed.): ''Ecosystems of the world: Subterranean Ecosystems'', pp. 109&ndash;132. Amsterdam: [[Elsevier]]</ref> The trunk is cylindrical, uniformly thick, and segmented with regularly spaced furrows at the [[myomere]] borders. The [[tail]] is relatively short, laterally flattened, and surrounded by a thin fin. The limbs are small and thin, with a reduced number of digits compared to other amphibians: the front legs have three digits instead of the normal four, and the rear have two digits instead of five. Its body is covered by a thin layer of skin, which contains very little of the [[biological pigment|pigment]] [[riboflavin]],<ref>{{cite journal |author=Istenic L. & Ziegler I. |year=1974 |title=Riboflavin as "pigment" in the skin of ''Proteus anguinus'' L. |journal=Naturwissenschaften |issue=12 |pages=686&ndash;687}}</ref> making it yellowish-white or pink in color.<ref name="animal"/> The internal organs can be seen shining through on the abdominal part of the body. The resemblance in color to that of [[White people|white]] humans is the reason why the ''Proteus'' is called ''human fish'' in some languages. However, the olm's skin retains the ability to produce [[melanin]]. When exposed to light, it will gradually turn dark, and in some cases the [[larva]]e are also colored. Its pear-shaped head ends with a short, dorsoventrally flattened snout. The mouth opening is small, with tiny [[tooth|teeth]] forming a [[sieve]] to keep larger particles inside the mouth. The nostrils are so small as to be imperceptible, but are placed somewhat [[Anatomical terms of location#Left and right .28lateral.29.2C and medial|laterally]] near the end of the snout. The regressed [[eye]]s are covered by a layer of skin. The olm breathes with external [[gill]]s that form two branched tufts at the back of the head.<ref name="animal"/> They are red in color because the oxygen-rich [[blood]] shows through the non-pigmented skin. The olm also has rudimentary [[lung]]s, but their role in respiration is only accessory. The sexes are very similar in appearance, with males having a somewhat thicker [[cloaca]] than females.

===Sensory organs===
Cave-dwelling animals have been prompted, among other adaptations, to develop and improve non-visual sensory systems in order to orient in and adapt to permanently dark habitats.<ref>Schlegel P.A., Briegleb W., Bulog B., Steinfartz S. (2006). {{lang|fr|''Revue et nouvelles donn<U+00E9>es sur la sensitivit<U+00E9> a la lumiere et orientation non-visuelle chez Proteus anguinus, Calotriton asper et Desmognathus ochrophaeus (Amphibiens urodeles hypog<U+00E9>s)''}}. Bulletin de la {{lang|fr|Soci<U+00E9>t<U+00E9> herp<U+00E9>tologique de France}}, '''118''', pp. 1&ndash;31. {{fr icon}}</ref> The olm's sensory system is also adapted to life in the subterranean aquatic environment. Unable to use vision for orientation, the olm compensates with other senses, which are better developed than in amphibians living on the surface. It retains larval proportions, like a long, slender body and a large, flattened head, and is thus able to carry a larger number of [[sensory receptor]]s.

====Photoreceptors====
The eyes are regressed, but retain sensitivity to [[light]]. They lie deep below the [[Skin#dermis|dermis of the skin]] and are rarely visible except in some younger adults. Larvae have normal eyes, but development soon stops and they start regressing, finally atrophying after four months of development.<ref name="DUR01">Durand J.P.

==== Chemoreceptors ====
[[Image:P anguinus-head1.jpg|thumb|200px|right|The front part of the olm's head carries sensitive chemo-, mechano-, and electroreceptors.]]

The olm is capable of sensing very low concentrations of organic compounds in the water. They are better at sensing both the quantity and quality of prey by smell than related amphibians.<ref name="HUP01">H<U+00FC>pop K. (2000). ''How do cave animals cope with the food scarcity in caves?''. In: Culver D.C. ''et al.'' (ed.): ''Ecosystems of the world: Subterranean Ecosystems'', pp. 159&ndash;188. Amsterdam: Elsevier</ref> The nasal [[epithelium]], located on the inner surface of the nasal cavity and in the [[Jacobson's organ]], is thicker than in other amphibians.<ref name="DC01">Dumas P. in Chris B. (1998). ''The olfaction in Proteus anguinus''. Behavioural Processes '''43''': 107&ndash;113</ref> The [[taste buds]] are in the [[mucous]] epithelium of the mouth, most of them on the upper side of the [[tongue]] and on the entrance to the gill cavities. Those in the oral cavity are used for tasting food, where those near the gills probably sense the chemical composition of water.

==== Mechano- and electroreceptors ====
The sensory [[epithelia]] of the [[inner ear]] are very specifically differentiated, enabling the olm to receive [[sound]] waves in the water, as well as [[vibration]]s from the ground. The complex functional-morphological orientation of the sensory cells enables the animal to register the sound sources<ref>Bulog B. (1989). ''Differentiation of the inner ear sensory epithelia of Proteus anguinus (Urodela, Amphibia)''. Journal of Morphology, '''202''', pp. 325&ndash;338.</ref><ref name="BUL01">Bulog B.

Biolo<U+0161>ki vestnik '''38''': 1&ndash;16 {{sl icon}}</ref>
Little is known about the hearing of ''Proteus'', but occasionally observed reactions to sounds indicate its possibility (Bulog, personal observ.). As this animal stays [[neotenic]] throughout its long life span, it is only occasionally exposed to normal adult hearing in air which is probably also possible for Proteus as in most salamanders. Hence, it would be of adaptive value in caves, with no vision available, to profit from underwater hearing by recognizing particular sounds and eventual localization of prey or other sound sources, i.e. acoustical orientation in general. The ethological experiments indicate that the best hearing sensitivity of ''Proteus'' is between 10&nbsp;Hz and up to 15,000&nbsp;Hz.<ref>Bulog B. & Schlegel P. (2000). ''Functional morphology of the inner ear and underwater audiograms of Proteus anguinus (Amphibia, Urodela)''. Pfl<U+00FC>gers Arch '''439'''(3), suppl., pp. R165&ndash;R167.</ref> The [[lateral line]] supplements inner ear sensitivity by registering low-frequency nearby water displacements.

A new type of sensory organ has been analyzed on the head of ''Proteus'', utilizing light and electron microscopy. These new organs have been described as [[ampullary organ]]s.<ref>Isteni<U+010D> L. & Bulog B. (1984). ''Some evidence for the ampullary organs in the European cave salamander Proteus anguinus'' (Urodela, Amphibia). Cell Tissue Res. '''235''', pp. 393&ndash;402.</ref>
Like some other lower [[vertebrate]]s, the olm has the ability to register weak [[electric field]]s.<ref name="SB01">Schegel P. & Bulog B. (1997). ''Population-specific behavioral electrosensitivity of the European blind cave salamander, Proteus anguinus''. Journal of Physiology (Paris) '''91''': 75&ndash;79</ref> Some behavioral experiments suggest that the olm may be able to use Earth's [[magnetic field]] to orient itself. Recently, ''Proteus'' ''anguinus'' has been found to align itself with natural and artificially modified magnetic fields.<ref>Bulog B., Schlegel P. ''et al.'' (2002).

==Ecology and life history==
[[Image:P anguinus1.jpg|thumb|200px|right|The olm swims by serpentine bending of the body.]]

The olm's [[embryo]]nic development takes 140 days, after which it takes another 14 years to reach sexual maturity. The larvae gain adult appearance after nearly four months, with the duration of development strongly correlating with water temperature.<ref name="DUR02">Durand J.P. & Delay B. (1981). ''Influence of temperature on the development of ''Proteus anguinus'' (Caudata: Proteidae) and relation with its habitat in the subterranean world''. Journal of Thermal Biology '''6'''(1): 53&ndash;57</ref> Unconfirmed historical observations of [[vivipary]] exist, but it has been shown that the females possess a [[gland]] that produces the egg casing, similar to those of [[fish]] and egg-laying amphibians.<ref name="ALJ01">Aljan<U+010D>i<U+010D> M., Bulog B. et al. (1993). ''Proteus &ndash; mysterious ruler of Karst darkness''. Ljubljana: Vitrium d.o.o. {{sl icon}}</ref> It was long thought that female olm gave birth to live young at lower temperatures and laid eggs at higher, but rigorous observations have not confirmed that. The olm appears to be [[ovipary|oviparous]].

The female lays up to 70 eggs, each about {{convert|12|mm|in|1}} in diameter, and places them between rocks, where they remain under her protection. The tadpoles are {{convert|2|cm|in|1}} long when they hatch and live on [[yolk]] stored in the cells of the digestive tract for a month.<ref name="AA01">Aljan<U+010D>i<U+010D> G. and Aljan<U+010D>i<U+010D> M.

Proteus '''61'''(2): 83&ndash;87 {{sl icon}}</ref>

Development of the olm and other [[troglobite]] amphibians is characterized by [[heterochrony]] &ndash; the animal does not undergo [[metamorphosis]] and instead retains larval features. The form of heterochrony in the olm is [[neoteny]] &ndash; delayed [[somatic]] maturity with precocious reproductive maturity, i.e. reproductive maturity is reached while retaining the larval external [[morphology (biology)|morphology]]. In other amphibians, the metamorphosis is regulated by the [[hormone]] [[thyroxine]], excreted by the [[thyroid]] gland. The thyroid is normally developed and functioning in the olm, so the lack of metamorphosis is due to the unresponsiveness of key [[Tissue (biology)|tissue]]s to thyroxine.<ref name="LANG01"/>

[[Image:P anguinus-head.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Disproportionately elongated head with gills.]]

The olm swims by eel-like twisting of its body, assisted only slightly by its poorly developed legs. It is a [[predator]]y animal, feeding on small [[crab]]s, [[snail]]s and occasionally [[insect]]s.<ref name="animal"/> It does not chew its food, instead swallowing it whole. The olm is resistant to long-term starvation, an adaptation to its underground habitat. It can consume large amounts of food at once, and store nutrients as large deposits of [[lipid]]s and [[glycogen]] in the [[liver]]. When food is scarce, it reduces its activity and [[metabolism|metabolic rate]], and can also reabsorb its own tissues in severe cases. Controlled experiments have shown that an olm can survive up to 10 years without food.<ref name="BUL02">Bulog B. (1994). {{lang|sl|''Dve desetletji funkcionalno-morfolo<U+0161>kih raziskav pri mo<U+010D>erilu (Proteus anguinus, Amphibia, Caudata)''}} (''Two decades of functional-morphological research on the olm (Proteus anguinus, Amphibia, Caudata''). Acta Carsologica XXIII/19. {{sl icon}}</ref>

Olms are [[Social animal|gregarious]], and usually aggregate either under stones or in fissures.<ref name="GUI01">Guillaume O. (2000). ''Role of chemical communication and behavioural interactions among conspecifics in the choice of shelters by the cave-dwelling salamander Proteus anguinus (Caudata, Proteidae)''. Can. J. Zool. '''78'''(2): 167&ndash;173</ref> Sexually active males are an exception, establishing and defending territories where they attract females. The scarcity of food makes fighting energetically costly, so encounters between males usually only involve [[Display (zoology)|display]]. This is a behavioral adaptation to life underground.<ref name="ALJ01"/>

Reproduction has only been observed in captivity so far.<ref name="ALJ01"/> Sexually mature males have swollen cloacas, brighter skin color, two lines at the side of the tail, and slightly curled fins. No such changes have been observed in the females. The male can start courtship even without the presence of a female. He chases other males away from the chosen area, and may then secrete a female-attracting [[pheromone]]. When the female approaches, he starts to circle around her and fan her with his tail. Then he starts to touch the female's body with his snout, and the female touches his cloaca with her snout. At that point, he starts to move forward with a twitching motion, and the female follows. He then deposits the [[spermatophore]], and the animals keep moving forward until the female hits it with her cloaca, after which she stops and stands still. The spermatophore sticks to her and the [[sperm]] cells swim inside her cloaca where they attempt to fertilize her eggs. The courtship ritual can be repeated several times over a couple of hours.<ref name="ALJ01"/>

Longevity is estimated at up to 58 years. <ref>Noellert A., Noellert C. (1992). ''Die Aphibien Europas''.

==Taxonomic history==
Olms from different cave systems differ substantially in body measurements, color and some microscopic characters. Earlier researchers used these differences to support the division into five different species, while modern herpetologists understand that external morphology is not reliable for amphibian systematics and can be extremely variable, depending on nourishment, illness, and other factors even varying among individuals in a single [[population]]. ''Proteus anguinus'' is now considered a single species. The length of the head is the most obvious difference among various populations &ndash; individuals from Sti<U+010D>na, Slovenia, have shorter heads on average than those from [[Tr<U+017E>i<U+010D>]], Slovenia, and the [[Istria]]n peninsula, for example.

===Black ''Proteus''===
[[Image:P anguinus parkelj-head.jpg|thumb|200px|right|The Black ''Proteus'', a subspecies, has a shorter head with more-developed eyes compared to the common type.]]
[[Image:Researchventhole.jpg|thumb|200px|right|The research vent-hole in Jel<U+0161>evnik near <U+010C>rnomelj, where quality checks of water and sediments are performed regularly, and where activities of Black ''Proteus'' are registered with [[IR]] camera.]]
The '''Black ''Proteus''''' (''Proteus anguinus parkelj'' <small>Sket & Arntzen, 1994</small>) is the only recognized subspecies of the olm, [[endemism|endemic]] to the underground waters near [[<U+010C>rnomelj]], Slovenia, an area smaller than {{convert|100|km2|sqmi|0}}. It was first found in 1986 by members of the [[Slovenian Karst Research Institute]] who were exploring the water from Dobli<U+010D>ice karst spring in the [[White Carniola|Bela krajina]] region.<ref name="ZSLO01">Sket B.

These features suggest that the Black ''Proteus'' has probably colonized underground habitats more recently and still retains some nontroglomorphic characteristics.

== Research history ==
The olm is supposedly first pictured as two pairs of [[snake]]s with [[wing]]s, which could represent gills, in a [[relief]] on a [[Venetian Republic|Venetia]]n stone fountain, probably originating from Karst.

The first written mention of the olm is in [[Janez Vajkard Valvasor]]'s ''[[The Glory of the Duchy of Carniola]]'' (1689) as a baby [[dragon]]. Heavy rains of Slovenia would wash the olms up from their subterranean habitat, giving rise to the folklore belief that great dragons lived beneath the Earth's crust, and the olms were the undeveloped offspring of these mythical beasts. In ''[[The Glory of the Duchy of Carniola]]'', Valvasor compiled the local Slovenian folk stories and pieced together the rich mythology of the creature and documented observations of the olm as <U+201C>Barely a span long, akin to a lizard, in short, a worm and vermin of which there are many hereabouts<U+201D>.<ref name="Nick Baker: Naturalist">[http://www.nickbaker.tv/feature-creature/]. ''Nickbaker.tv"</ref>

[[Image:Proteus - Laurenti.jpg|thumb|left|220px|Sketch of the olm in ''Specimen Medicum, Exhibens Synopsin Reptilium Emendatam cum Experimentis circa Venena'' (1768) by [[Josephus Nicolaus Laurenti]]]]
The first researcher to retrieve a live olm was a [[physician]] and researcher from [[Idrija]], [[Giovanni Antonio Scopoli|G.A. Scopoli]]; he sent dead specimens and drawings to colleagues and collectors. [[Josephus Nicolaus Laurenti]], though, was the first to briefly describe the olm in 1768 and give it the scientific name ''Proteus anguinus''. It was not until the end of the century that [[Carl Franz Anton Ritter von Schreibers]] from the [[Naturhistorisches Museum]] of [[Vienna]] started to look into this animal's anatomy. The specimens were sent to him by [[<U+017D>iga Zois]]. Schreibers presented his findings in 1801 to The [[Royal Society]] in [[London]], and later also in [[Paris]]. Soon the olm started to gain wide recognition and attract significant attention, resulting in thousands of animals being sent to researchers and collectors worldwide. The basis of functional morphological investigations in Slovenia was set up by Prof. dr. [[Lili Isteni<U+010D>]] in the 1980s. More than twenty years the Research Group for functional morphological Studies of the Vertebrates in the Department of Biology (Biotechnical Faculty, [[University of Ljubljana]]), is one of the leading groups studying the olm under the guidance of Prof.dr. [[Boris Bulog]].<ref>Bulog B. et al. (2003). ''Black Proteus: mysterious dweller of the Karst in Bela krajina ''. Ljubljana: TV Slovenia, Video tape.</ref> There are also several cave laboratories in Europe, where olms have been introduced and are being studied. These are [[Moulis]] ([[France]]), [[Kent's Cavern]] ([[England]]), [[Han-sur-Lesse]] ([[Belgium]]) and [[Aggtelek]] ([[Hungary]]). They were also [[Introduced species|introduced]] into the [[Hermannsh<U+00F6>hle]] ([[Germany]]) and [[Oliero]] ([[Italy]]) caves, where they still live today.

The olm was used by [[Charles Darwin]] in his famous ''[[On the Origin of Species]]'' as an example for the reduction of structures through disuse:<ref name="DARWIN01">Darwin C. (1859). ''On the origin of species by means of natural selection, or the preservation of favoured races in the struggle for life''. London: John Murray.</ref>

{{cquote|Far from feeling surprise that some of the cave-animals should be very anomalous<U+2026>as is the case with blind Proteus with reference to the reptiles of Europe, I am only surprised that more wrecks of ancient life have not been preserved, owing to the less severe competition to which the scanty inhabitants of these dark abodes will have been exposed.}}

== Conservation status ==
[[Image:Proteus anguinus distribution.png|thumb|200px|right|Range map (North of the [[Adriatic Sea]]).]]
The olm is extremely vulnerable to changes in its environment due to its adaptation to the specific conditions in caves. Water resources in the karst are extremely sensitive to all kinds of pollution.<ref>Bulog B., Mihajl K. ''et al.'' (2002). ''Trace element concentrations in the tissues of Proteus anguinus (Amphibia, Caudata) and the surrounding environment''. Water air soil pollut., '''136'''(1&ndash;4), pp. 147&ndash;163</ref> The contamination of the karst underground waters is due to the large number of waste disposal sites leached by rainwater, as well as to the accidental overflow of various liquids. The reflection of such pollution in the karst underground waters depends on the type and quantity of pollutants, and on the rock structure through which the waters penetrate. Self-purification processes in the underground waters are not completely understood, but they are quite different from those in surface waters. Among the most serious chemical [[pollutants]] are chlorinated hydrocarbon [[pesticide]]s, [[fertilizer]]s, polychlorinated biphenyls ([[Polychlorinated biphenyls|PCB]]s), which are or were used in a variety of industrial processes and in the manufacture of many kinds of materials; and metals such as mercury, lead, cadmium, and arsenic. All of these substances persist in the environment, being slowly, if at all, degraded by natural processes. In addition, all are toxic to life if they accumulate in any appreciable quantity. Slovenian caves became famous for the animals they contained and which could not be found elsewhere. Due to its rarity the olm is also popular among collectors, which can threaten the species by taking too many animals out of the habitat.

The olm is included in Appendices II and IV of the [[Habitats Directive|EU Habitats Directive]] (92/43/EEC).<ref name="EEC01">''EU Habitats directive'' (1992). [http://ec.europa.eu/environment/nature/legislation/habitatsdirective/index_en.htm].</ref> Appendix II seeks to preserve favorable conservation status in animal and [[plant]] species along with their [[habitat]]s by protecting the species or defining special areas of conservation. These areas of conservation form the [[Natura 2000]] network. Appendix IV further defines "animal and plant species of community interest in need of strict protection." Hunting or keeping a limited number of olm is allowed only under strictly controlled circumstances, determined by local authorities.

The olm was first protected in Slovenia in 1922 along with all cave fauna, but the protection was not effective and a substantial black market came into existence. In 1982 it was placed on a list of rare and endangered species. This list also had the effect of prohibiting trade of the species. After joining the [[European Union]], Slovenia had to establish mechanisms for protection of the species included in the EU Habitats Directive. The olm is included in a Slovenian ''[[Red list]]'' of endangered species.<ref name="UL01">''Slovenian official gazette'' (2002).

In Croatia, the olm is protected by the legislation designed to protect amphibians<ref name="NN01">{{lang|hr|''Pravilnik o za<U+0161>titi vodozemaca (2002)'', [http://www.nn.hr/clanci/sluzbeno/1999/1435.htm Dr<U+017E>avna uprava za za<U+0161>titu prirode i okoli<U+0161>a]}}. {{hr icon}}</ref> &ndash; collecting is possible only for research purposes by permission of the National Administration for Nature and Environment Protection. Conservation status in [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] and [[Montenegro]] has not yet been defined.

On the [[IUCN Red List]], the olm is listed as vulnerable because of its fragmented and limited distribution and ever-decreasing population.<ref name="iucn"/>

==Cultural significance==
[[Image:SVN001.JPG|200px|left|thumb|A coin depicting the olm, in the old Slovenian national currency [[Slovenian tolar|tolar]].]]

The olm is a symbol of Slovenian natural heritage. The enthusiasm of scientists and the broader public about this inhabitant of Slovenian caves is still strong 300 years after its discovery. The [[Postojna cave]] is one of the birthplaces of [[speleology#cave_biology|speleobiology]] due to the olm and other rare cave inhabitants, such as the [[Leptodirus hochenwartii|blind cave beetle]]. The image of the olm contributes significantly to the fame of the Postojna cave, which Slovenia successfully utilizes for the promotion of [[eco-tourism]] in [[Postojna]] and other parts of Slovenian karst. Tours of the Postojna cave also include a tour around the speleobiological station &ndash; the Proteus [[vivarium]], showing different aspects of the cave environment.<ref name="vivarium">[http://www.postojnska-jama.si/?cat=81&lang=en&PHPSESSID=b59779a3f5babf443ef966f0264dc436 Destinacija Postojna]. Retrieved 7 June 2007.</ref>

The olm was also depicted on one of the [[Slovenian tolar]] coins, and was the namesake of ''Proteus'', the oldest Slovenian popular science magazine, first published in 1933.
