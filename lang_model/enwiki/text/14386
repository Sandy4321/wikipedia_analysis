== History of research ==

Originally discovered in 1892 by William S. Valiant, the site was thoroughly excavated from 1893-1895 by [[Charles Emerson Beecher]] (after whom the location is named) of [[Yale University]], after which time the location was thought to be exhausted of fossils and excavations ceased.<ref name=Etter02>{{Cite book

== Sedimentology, environment of deposition & preservation ==

{{see|Beecher<U+2019>s Trilobite type preservation}}
The original Beecher's Trilobite Bed is found within a thick succession of fine grained [[turbidite]] beds, the fossiliferous bed  is about 40 mm thick laying on a scoured mudstone surface with remnants of burrows.<ref name=Cisne1973/> Well preserved fossil remains are found 7-10 mm above the base parallel to the bedding plane, strongly aligned by the current, with as many facing up as down.<ref name=Briggs-etal1991/><ref name=Beecher02>{{cite journal

== Fauna ==

The trilobite ''[[Triarthrus|Triarthrus eatoni]]'' comprises 85% of the organisms sampled at the locality, other taxa include [[graptolite]]s, branching algae, brachiopods, and problematica.<ref name=Hagadorn&Buck2004>{{Cite journal
