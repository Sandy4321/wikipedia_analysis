[[Air Vice Marshal (Australia)|Air Vice Marshal]] '''Allan Leslie Walters''' [[Order of the Bath|CB]], [[Order of the British Empire|CBE]], [[Air Force Cross (United Kingdom)|AFC]] (2&nbsp;November 1905 &ndash; 19&nbsp;October 1968) was a senior commander in the [[Royal Australian Air Force]] (RAAF). Born in [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], he graduated from the [[Royal Military College, Duntroon]], before transferring to the RAAF in 1928. He was considered one of the service's leading [[Flight instructor|flying instructors]] and [[aerobatics|aerobatic]] pilots between the wars, and was appointed to his first [[squadron]] command in 1937. Over the course of [[Military history of Australia during World War II|World War II]], Walters led [[No. 1 Squadron RAAF|No.&nbsp;1 (General Reconnaissance) Squadron]] in [[Singapore]], [[No. 1 Wing RAAF|No.&nbsp;1  (Fighter) Wing]] in [[Darwin, Northern Territory]], and [[No. 72 Wing RAAF|No.&nbsp;72 Wing]] in [[Netherlands New Guinea|Dutch New Guinea]]. He was decorated with the [[Air Force Cross (United Kingdom)|Air Force Cross]] in 1941, and [[Mentioned in Despatches]] in 1944. 

By 1945, Walters had risen to the rank of [[Air Commodore]], and the following year was appointed a [[Commander of the Order of the British Empire]]. Already marked out for senior roles in the the post-war RAAF, his positions from 1950 onwards included [[Air Officer Commanding]] (AOC) RAAF Overseas Headquarters in London, Head of the Australian Joint Services Staff in Washington,&nbsp;D.C., AOC Home Command (later to become [[RAAF Air Command|Air Command]]), Air Member for Personnel, and AOC Support Command.

==Early career==
Allan Walters was born on 2&nbsp;November 1905 in [[Ascot Vale, Victoria|Ascot Vale]], Victoria, to schoolteacher Ferdinand Walters and his wife Edith. The family soon moved to [[Perth, Western Australia|Perth]], Western Australia, and Allan completed his education at Perth Modern School, where he joined the [[Australian Army Cadets|cadets]]. After eight months in the [[Australian Army Reserve|militia]], he entered the [[Royal Military College, Duntroon]], in February 1924.  Graduating as a [[Lieutenant]] in December 1927, he transferred to the [[Royal Australian Air Force]] (RAAF) on 1&nbsp;February 1928.<ref name="ADB"/><ref name="WW2">[http://www.ww2roll.gov.au/script/veteran.asp?ServiceID=R&VeteranID=1081091 Walters, Allan Leslie] at [http://www.ww2roll.gov.au World War 2 Nominal Roll]. Retrieved 12 March 2010.</ref> Ranked [[Flying Officer]], Walters graduated as a pilot in March 1929. He showed an aptitude for instruction, and after completing further training he was graded an 'A1' [[flight instructor]], a rare distinction. Posted to [[No. 3 Squadron RAAF|No.&nbsp;3 Squadron]] at [[RAAF Base Richmond|RAAF Station Richmond]] in New South Wales, operating [[Westland Wapiti]]s, he also made a name for himself performing [[aerobatics]] at air shows throughout the country.<ref name="ADB"/><ref>Roylance, ''Air Base Richmond'', pp. 31&ndash;33</ref>  Walters put this particular talent to use in pursuit of his wife-to-be, Jean Manning, stunt flying above All Saints Church, [[North Parramatta, New South Wales|North Parramatta]], where her father was rector. Reverend Manning married the couple there on 30&nbsp;June 1930; they later had a daughter.<ref name="ADB"/>

On 5&nbsp;January 1931, the now-[[Flight Lieutenant]] Walters won a trophy in an air obstacle race at the [[Cootamundra]] Air Pageant. In May the following year, he took out the NSW Air Derby and Evening News Cup.<ref>Roylance, ''Air Base Richmond'', pp. 38&ndash;39</ref> He temporarily held command of No.&nbsp;3 Squadron during October 1933, in the absence of Squadron Leader [[William Bostock|Bill Bostock]].<ref name="Roylance">Roylance, ''Air Base Richmond'', p. 123</ref> Walters was posted to Britain in 1936 to attend the [[Royal Air Force Staff College, Andover]], and was promoted to [[Squadron Leader]] in March 1937, while still overseas.<ref name="ADB"/><ref name="Air Marshals">Coulthard-Clark, ''Air Marshals of the RAAF'', p. 34</ref> Returning to Australia, he took command of [[No. 22 Squadron RAAF|No.&nbsp;22 Squadron]] on 30&nbsp;June, operating [[Avro Anson]]s out of Richmond until 3&nbsp;February 1938.<ref>Roylance, ''Air Base Richmond'', p. 115</ref> Between 6 and 23&nbsp;February, he piloted the first overseas flight in an aeroplane designed and built in Australia when he flew the [[Chief of Air Force (Australia)|Chief of the Air Staff]], Air Vice Marshal [[Richard Williams (RAAF officer)|Richard Williams]], to [[Singapore]] in a [[Lawrence Wackett#Wackett_in_the_1930s|Tugan Gannet]].<ref>Coulthard-Clark, ''The Third Brother'', p. 394</ref> Walters returned to Richmond to lead No.&nbsp;3 Squadron from 10&nbsp;May 1938 until 12&nbsp;May 1939, flying [[Hawker Demon]]s.<ref name="Roylance"/> From there he transferred to [[Melbourne]] as Director of Staff Duties at RAAF Headquarters.<ref name="Air Marshals"/> Later that month, he joined Group Captain [[Henry Wrigley]] as an expert assessor on the panel of an inquiry into a recent spate of three Anson accidents; the full report handed down in October found human error the likely explanation for at least one crash and that training on the type followed the syllabus laid down, but that pilots needed more practical experience in dealing with potential in-flight incidents.<ref>Coulthard-Clark, ''The Third Brother'', pp. 349&ndash;350</ref>

Walters' first operational appointment following the outbreak of [[Military history of Australia during World War II|World War&nbsp;II]] was as Commanding Officer of [[No. 1 Squadron RAAF|No.&nbsp;1 (General Reconnaissance) Squadron]], which he led to [[Sembawang]], Singapore in July 1940. Deployed in response to fears of [[Empire of Japan|Japanese]] expansion in [[Malaysia|Malaya]], the squadron was the first Australian unit equipped with [[Lockheed Hudson]] light bombers, which were employed primarily in [[maritime patrol]] work.<ref>Gillison, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/26/chapters/07.pdf ''Royal Australian Air Force 1939&ndash;1942'', pp. 141&ndash;142]</ref><ref>[http://www.awm.gov.au/units/unit_11019second_world_war.asp No. 1 Squadron] at [[Australian War Memorial]].

By April 1942, he had been promoted to temporary [[Group Captain]] and joined Allied Air Forces Headquarters, [[South West Pacific Area (command)|South West Pacific Area]] (SWPA) in Melbourne as Director of Operations. In September, he was transferred to Headquarters RAAF Command as Senior Air Staff Officer.<ref name="ADB"/><ref>Gillison, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/26/chapters/28.pdf ''Royal Australian Air Force 1939&ndash;1942'', pp. 574, 588]</ref>

On 7&nbsp;October 1942, Walters took command of a new formation, [[No. 1 Wing RAAF|No.&nbsp;1 (Fighter) Wing]], at RAAF Station Richmond. Established to boost the air defence capability of [[North Western Area Campaign|North Western Area]], the wing comprised [[No. 54 Squadron RAF|No.&nbsp;54 Squadron RAF]], [[No. 452 Squadron RAAF|No.&nbsp;452 Squadron RAAF]] and [[No. 457 Squadron RAAF|No.&nbsp;457 Squadron RAAF]], all operating [[Supermarine Spitfire]]s and fresh from combat in Europe. With Wing Commander [[Clive Caldwell]], Australia's top-scoring [[flying ace]] of the war, as his wing leader, Walters began transferring aircraft and men to [[Darwin, Northern Territory|Darwin]], Northern Territory in December, providing a filip for morale in the region.<ref>Roylance, ''Air Base Richmond'', pp. 83&ndash;84</ref><ref name="Gillison">Gillison, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/26/chapters/30.pdf ''Royal Australian Air Force 1939&ndash;1942'', pp. 651&ndash;652]</ref> Proudly declaring himself Australia's oldest fighter pilot, Walters took every opportunity to join his men in aerial combat.<ref name="ADB"/> He flew as Caldwell's [[wingman]] in No.&nbsp;1 Wing's first major action against the Japanese over Darwin on 2&nbsp;May, narrowly avoiding being shot down when he warned his companion of an attacking enemy fighter, to the detriment of his own safety. After they landed, Caldwell chided his commander, "You silly old so-and-so. You want to look after your own skin instead of worrying about someone else's!"<ref>Alexander, ''Clive Caldwell'', pp. 109&ndash;111</ref> On 20&nbsp;June, Walters participated in his wing's most successful day against the Japanese to that date, personally accounting for one of fourteen raiders brought down by the Spitfires, for the loss of two of their own number.<ref>[http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/27/chapters/04.pdf Odgers, ''Air War Against Japan'', pp. 59&ndash;60]</ref> He posted out of Darwin a few days later, having earned the admiration of Caldwell and the rest of the wing's personnel.<ref>Alexander, ''Clive Caldwell'', p. 141</ref>

Walters assumed command of [[No. 5 Service Flying Training School RAAF|No.&nbsp;5 Service Flying Training School]] in [[Uranquinty, New South Wales|Uranquinty]], New South Wales on 30&nbsp;June, but the next month was posted to [[Merauke]] in Dutch New Guinea to take over [[No. 72 Wing RAAF|No.&nbsp;72 Wing]] following reassignment of its founding commander, Group Captain [[Charles Eaton (RAAF officer)|Charles Eaton]].<ref name="ADB"/><ref>[http://www.adb.online.anu.edu.au/biogs/A140082b.htm Eaton, Charles (1895 &ndash; 1979)] at Australian Dictionary of Biography.

==Post-war career==

Walters was among a small coterie of highly regarded operational commanders, including Air Commodores [[John McCauley (RAAF officer)|John McCauley]] and [[Frederick Scherger]], earmarked by the Australian Air Board in October 1945 for senior leadership roles in the post-war Air Force. In the short term, however, he reverted to his substantive rank of Group Captain, as the officer corps shrank drastically with demobilisation.<ref>Helson, ''Ten Years at the Top'', p. 238</ref><ref>Stephens, ''Going Solo'', pp. 24&ndash;25, 73</ref> In 1946, Walters became Director of Air Staff Plans and Policy at RAAF Headquarters, and was appointed a [[Commander of the Order of the British Empire]] (CBE) in the King's Birthday Honours for his "conspicuous service in operations against the Japanese" while in charge of Northern Area during the war.<ref>[http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/AWM192/00302/003020400.pdf Recommendation: Commander of the Order of the British Empire] at Australian War Memorial.

Raised to Air Commodore, he served as AOC Southern Area from 1948 to 1950, and then as AOC RAAF Overseas Headquarters in London through 1951. In December that year, he was part of the Australian contingent at the Commonwealth Air Forces Conference, where an RAAF presence was sought in the Middle East; this eventually led to [[No. 78 Wing RAAF|No.&nbsp;78 Wing]] being reformed and deployed to [[RAF Hal Far]], Malta, in July 1952. Although Walters was keen to use the opportunity to acquire the RAAF's first [[F-86 Sabre]]s, political realities led him to negotiate a deal whereby the wing was equipped with leased British [[De Havilland Vampire|Vampire FB.9s]].<ref name="Air Marshals"/><ref>Stephens, ''Going Solo'', pp. 202&ndash;203</ref> 

After completing his tour in London, Walters was posted to Washington,&nbsp;D.C. to head up the Australian Joint Services Staff during 1952&ndash;53.<ref name="Air Marshals"/> He was promoted to acting [[Air Vice Marshal]] in October 1952; this rank was made permanent in January 1954, when he succeeded Air Vice Marshal McCauley to become AOC Home Command (later Operational Command and now [[RAAF Air Command|Air Command]]). Walters held this post for three years, his tenure witnessing the introduction of the [[CAC Sabre]] to operational service in the RAAF,  when [[No. 3 Squadron RAAF|No.&nbsp;3 Squadron]] took delivery of its first machine in March 1956.<ref name="ADB"/><ref>Stephens, ''Going Solo'', pp.348&ndash;349</ref> In the [[New Years Honours]] that year, Walters had been appointed a [[Companion of the Order of the Bath]] (CB).<ref>[http://www.awm.gov.au/research/people/honours_and_awards/person.asp?p=357192 Awarded: Companion of the Bath] at Australian War Memorial.

Scherger gained the appointment, and Walters became Air Member for Personnel in October.<ref>Stephens; Isaacs, ''High Fliers'', p. 123</ref><ref name="Solo">Stephens, ''Going Solo'', pp. 499&ndash;500</ref> He served in this position until August 1959, when he was appointed AOC Support Command.<ref name="Air Marshals"/><ref name="Solo"/> When Scherger's term as CAS was due to complete in May 1961, Walters and Hancock were once more put forward to the [[Minister for Defence (Australia)|Minister for Air]] as potential replacements. "Walters was again unlucky", in the words of RAAF historians Alan Stephens and Keith Isaacs, Hancock's "professional ability, operational experience and personal qualities" being deemed more appropriate for the role.<ref>Stephens; Isaacs, ''High Fliers'', p. 137</ref> Walters retired from the miltary on 16&nbsp;May 1962, after completing his term at Headquarters Support Command.<ref name="WW2"/> He followed horse racing in private life.
