'''M-34''' is an east<U+2013>west [[Michigan State Trunkline Highway System|state trunkline highway]] in the [[Southeast Michigan|southeastern region]] of the US state of [[Michigan]]. It has a western terminus near [[Osseo, Michigan|Osseo]] on [[M-99 (Michigan highway)|M-99]] and runs through forest and farm lands to its eastern terminus at [[U.S. Route 223 Business (Adrian, Michigan)|Business US Highway 223]] (BUS US&nbsp;223) and [[M-52 (Michigan highway)|M-52]] in [[Adrian, Michigan|Adrian]]. The highway serves a number of smaller communities in the area and intersects two [[United States Highway System|US Highways]] while carrying between 4,200 and 11,300 vehicles on a daily basis.

M-34 was designated and signed with the beginning of the state highway system around July&nbsp;1, 1919, along a route that extended to either end of its current routing. These western and eastern extensions were added to other highways during the 1920s, shortening M-34 to roughly its current length. A few more changes were made in the mid 1950s and 1960s resulting in the modern routing. M-34 has a short, unsigned sibling, '''Connector 34''', which is better known as '''Industrial Drive''' in the Adrian area.

==Route description==
M-34 begins at an intersection with M-99 just west of Osseo. M-99 approaches Osseo from the west along Hudson Road and where M-99 turns south along Pioneer Road, M-34 continues east along Hudson Road. The highway turns to the southeast to the south of Osseo near Deer Lake and continues towards [[Pittsford, Michigan|Pittsford]]. Hudson Road runs through a mix of forests and local farms. The trunkline passes to the south of the main business district in Pittsford. East of town, the highway turns east and intersects [[U.S. Route 127 in Michigan|US Highway 127]] (US&nbsp;127) at the [[Hillsdale County, Michigan|Hillsdale]]<U+2013>[[Lenawee County, Michigan|Lenawee]] county line in [[Hudson, Michigan|Hudson]]. The trunkline continues eastward through the city of Hudson as Main Street. On the eastern edge of town, it becomes Carleton Road and passes through more farmland. Just south of [[Clayton, Michigan|Clayton]], M-34 has a junction with the northern terminus of [[M-156 (Michigan highway)|M-156]], a connector highway that runs south into Ohio and [[U.S. Route 20 in Ohio|US&nbsp;20]].<ref name=MDOT11>{{cite map |publisher= Michigan Department of Transportation |title= State Transportation Map |year= 2011 |scale= 1&nbsp;in:15&nbsp;mi/1&nbsp;cm:9&nbsp;km |section= N11<U+2013>N12}}</ref><ref name=google>{{google maps |url= http://maps.google.com/maps?saddr=M-34+E%2FHudson+Rd&daddr=W+Beecher+St&hl=en&sll=41.885282,-84.546318&sspn=0.123198,0.116386&geocode=FS4dfwId_r31-g%3BFZ8ufwIdrJn9-g&vpsrc=0&mra=ls&t=h&z=10 |title= Overview Map of M-34 |accessdate= October 27, 2011}}</ref>

[[Image:M-34 Michigan Highway eastern terminus.JPG|thumb|left|M-34 eastern terminus, Adrian]]
Approximately four miles (6.4&nbsp;km) east of that junction, M-34 turns north for about two miles (3.2&nbsp;km) along Benner Highway and passes through the community of [[Cadmus, Michigan|Cadmus]]. At the end of its course along Benner Highway, M-34 turns east towards Adrian on Beecher Road. There are some residential subdivisions along the road on the southwest side of Adrian. M-34 intersects Industrial Drive and crosses [[U.S. Route 223|US&nbsp;223]] and Beecher Road becomes Beecher Street in town. The trunkline continues east and terminates at the intersection of Beecher and Main streets where it meets BUS US&nbsp;223/M-52.<ref name=MDOT11/><ref name=google/>

M-34 is maintained by the [[Michigan Department of Transportation]] (MDOT) like other state highways in Michigan. As a part of these maintenance responsibilities, the department tracks the volume of traffic that uses the roadways under its jurisdiction. These volumes are expressed using a metric called [[annual average daily traffic]], which is a statistical calculation of the average daily number of vehicles on a segment of roadway. MDOT's surveys in 2010 showed that the highest traffic levels along M-34 were the 11,302&nbsp;vehicles daily immediately east of the BUS US&nbsp;223/M-52 junction in Adrian; the lowest counts were the 4,166&nbsp;vehicles per day between Hudson and the M-156 junction.<ref name=TMIS>{{cite web |author= Bureau of Transportation Planning<U+200E> |url=http://mdotnetpublic.state.mi.us/tmispublic/ |title= Traffic Monitoring Information System |publisher=Michigan Department of Transportation |date=2008 |accessdate=October 27, 2011}}</ref> No section of M-34 has been listed on the [[National Highway System (United States)|National Highway System]],<ref name=NHS-MI>{{cite map | title=National Highway System, Michigan | date=April 23, 2006 | publisher=Michigan Department of Transportation | url=http://www.michigan.gov/documents/MDOT_NHS_Statewide_150626_7.pdf | format=PDF|accessdate=October 7, 2008}}</ref> a network of roads important to the country's economy, defense, and mobility.<ref name=NHS>{{cite web |last= Adderley |first= Kevin |url=http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/planning/nhs/ |title= The National Highway System |publisher=Federal Highway Administration |date= August 26, 2010 |accessdate= January 1, 2011}}</ref>

==History==
When the state highway system was signed around July 1, 1919, M-34 started in [[Jonesville, Michigan|Jonesville]] at an intersection with [[M-23 (Michigan highway)|M-23]] along the present-day alignment of M-99. The highway ran to Adrian along its present route and continued southeasterly along present-day US&nbsp;223 through [[Blissfield, Michigan|Blissfield]], where it terminated at the [[Ohio]] state line near [[Sylvania, Ohio]].<ref name=MSHD19LP/> In 1924, the western terminus of the highway was extended to [[Homer, Michigan|Homer]] where it terminated at [[M-60 (Michigan highway)|M-60]].<ref name=MSHD24-05>{{cite map |publisher=Michigan State Highway Department |title=Official Highway Service Map |year=May 15, 1924 |cartography= MSHD }}</ref><ref name=MSHD24-10>{{cite map |publisher=Michigan State Highway Department |title=Official Highway Service Map |year=October 1, 1924 |cartography= MSHD }}</ref> Just a few years later, in 1926, the western terminus was truncated, to end at Hillsdale, with the remainder to Jonesville becoming an extension of the [[M-64 (Michigan highway)|M-64]] of the day. At the same time, the eastern segment of M-34 from Adrian to the border was assumed into the US&nbsp;127 corridor, therefore, scaling the terminus back to US&nbsp;127 (now US&nbsp;223).<ref name=MSHD26-12>{{cite map |publisher=Michigan State Highway Department |title=Official Highway Service Map |year=December 1, 1926 |cartography= MSHD }}</ref>

In 1954, a new US&nbsp;223 bypass was built around Adrian, resulting in the relocation of M-34 to end at BUS US&nbsp;223/M-52.<ref name=MSHD54-04>{{cite map |publisher=Michigan State Highway Department |title=1954 Official Highway Map |year=April 15, 1954 |section= N12}}</ref><ref name=MSHD54-10>{{cite map |publisher=Michigan State Highway Department |title=1954 Official Highway Map |year=October 1, 1954 |section= N12}}</ref> Finally, in 1966, when a new alignment of M-99 highway was opened, the western terminus of M-34 was scaled back to end at the new highway near Osseo.<ref name=MDSH66>{{cite map |publisher=Michigan Department of State Highways |title=Official Highway Map |year=1966 |section= N11}}</ref><ref name=MDSH67>{{cite map |publisher=Michigan Department of State Highways |title=Official Highway Map |year=1967 |section= N11}}</ref> In 2003, the short connector between M-34 and US&nbsp;223 was abandoned and obliterated. Industrial Drive, which is known internally at MDOT as Connector 34, is a new connector between the two highways that was assumed into the state trunkline system at the same time.<ref name=TOM03>{{cite map |publisher=Michigan Department of Transportation |title=Truck Operator's Map |year=2003 |scale= 1&nbsp;in:14.5&nbsp;mi/1&nbsp;cm:9&nbsp;km |inset= Adrian}}</ref><ref name=TOM04>{{cite map |publisher=Michigan Department of Transportation |title=Truck Operator's Map |year=2004 |scale= 1&nbsp;in:15&nbsp;mi/1&nbsp;cm:9&nbsp;km |inset= Adrian}}</ref>
