'''Adriaan Gilles Camper''' (March 31, 1759 <U+2013> February 5, 1820) was a 19th-century Dutch mathematics and physics professor at the [[University of Franeker]] who took to politics and became a statesman in his later years. He was the son of [[Petrus Camper]] is known today primarily for his paleontological work in collaboration with his father, causing several fossil [[holotype]]s to be named after him, such as the [[Puppigerus]] P. Camperi. The engravings he commissioned on the basis of his father's work were published by [[Barth<U+00E9>lemy Faujas de Saint-Fond]]. He himself wrote several books on paleontology, including a catalog of his collection of fossils and minerals.<ref>[http://books.google.com/books?q=inauthor:Adriaan+Gilles+Camper Books by Adriaan Gilles Camper] on the [[Google Books Library Project]]</ref>

His daughter Frederica married one of his pupils in Franeker, the Dutch geologist [[J.G.S. van Breda]] (who later became curator of the [[Teylers Museum]] in Haarlem). Van Breda wrote a biography of father-in-law, in which he describes him as the home-schooled wunderkind who entered the University of Franeker at age 14 already learned in natural history and modern languages from his close association with his father.<ref name=Breda>[http://books.google.nl/books?id=XOQ5AAAAcAAJ Levens-schets van Adriaan Gilles Camper] by J.G.S. van Breda on [[Google books]]</ref> Three years later, in 1776, his mother died, and his father was so struck by the loss that he undertook a leave of absence from the university to travel to Paris and the young Adriaan went with him.<ref name=Breda/> There due to the fame of his father, they were received with open arms by the various learned societies such as the [[French Academy of Sciences]] and consorted with Louis, [[Antoine Portal]], [[Jacques-Ren<U+00E9> Tenon]], [[Julien-David Le Roy]], the Count [[Jean-Charles de Borda]], the [[Marquis de Condorcet]], and [[Benjamin Franklin]] (''the American liberator'').<ref name=Breda/>
