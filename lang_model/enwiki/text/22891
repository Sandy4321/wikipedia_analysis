'''John Caldwell Colt''' (March 1, 1810 <U+2013> November 18, 1842), the brother of [[Samuel Colt]] of [[Colt's Manufacturing Company|Colt firearm fame]], was a fur-trader, book keeper, law clerk, and teacher.  He briefly served as a Marine, forging a letter to get himself discharged after 3 months.  After numerous business ventures he became an authority on  [[double-entry bookkeeping system|double-entry bookkeeping]] and published a textbook on the subject which went through 45 editions and remained in continuous publication 13 years after his death.<ref name =hs81/>

In 1842 Colt was convicted of the [[murder]] of a printer named Samuel Adams, to whom Colt owed money over the publication of a bookkeeping textbook.  Colt killed Adams with a hatchet the previous year in what he claimed was self-defense, but afterwards covered up the crime by disposing of the body.  When the body was discovered, Colt was the first suspect.  The trial became a sensation in the [[New York City|New York]] press, because of his family connections, the manner of disposal and his somewhat arrogant demeanor in the courtroom.  Colt was found guilty and sentenced to hang in 1842, but committed suicide on the morning of his execution.<ref name=NYer>{{Cite journal|journal=New York Magazine|title=The Suicide or Escape of a Condemned Millionaire|year=1988|page=42|volume=21|issue=45|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=s-MCAAAAMBAJ&dq=john+colt+suicide&q=Colt#v=snippet&q=Colt&f=false|accessdate=October 6, 2011 }}</ref>

Conspiracy theories circulated about the suicide, with some holding that Colt had in fact escaped from prison and staged a body to look like his own. One publication alleged that a family member smuggled the knife used in the suicide into his cell.  Others stated that Colt was living in California with his wife, Caroline.<ref name=NYer/>  None of these allegations was ever proven.<ref name=Meyer>{{cite journal|title=That Was New York: The Tombs--I|first=Meyer |last=Berger |date=August 30, 1941 |journal= The New Yorker|url= http://www.newyorker.com/archive/1941/08/30/1941_08_30_022_TNY_CARDS_000186815|accessdate=October 8, 2011}}</ref> [[Edgar Allen Poe]] may have based a short story, ''[[The Oblong Box (short story)|The Oblong Box]]'', partly on the murder of Adams,<ref name=walsh>{{cite journal|title=Poe the detective: the curious circumstances behind The mystery of Marie Roget|journal=Literary Criticism|last=Walsh|first=John|authorlink=John Walsh|page=2|year=1968|publisher= Rutgers University Press|quote=The Oblong Box" (not a story of crime as Poe told it) is based in part on the murder of the printer Samuel Adams by John C. Colt<U+2014> which succeeded the death of Mary Rogers as the leading sensational topic for the American press}}</ref> and [[Herman Melville]] alluded to the case in his short story [[Bartleby the Scrivener]].

==Early life==
John Colt was born in  [[Hartford]], [[Connecticut]]. His father was Christopher Colt, a farmer who had moved his family to Hartford when he changed professions and became a businessman. His mother, Sarah Colt n<U+00E9>e Caldwell, died when Colt was eleven years old.  Christopher Colt  remarried two years later to Olive Sergeant.  The Colt family included eight siblings: five boys and three girls. Two of the sisters died in childhood.<ref name =hs36>{{Harv|Schechter|2010|p=36}}</ref>

Colt worked as an assistant book keeper at age 14 for the Union Manufacturing Company in Marlborough, Connecticut.  He left the job and moved to [[Albany, New York|Albany]], [[New York]] in less than a year.  He returned to Hartford in 1826 and studied at an academy for three months.  In 1827 he found employment as a math teacher at a ladies seminary in [[Baltimore]], [[Maryland]] for a year.  In 1828 he became a supervisory engineer for a canal near [[Wilkes-Barre]], [[Pennsylvania]].  The following year his sister, Sarah Ann committed suicide by taking [[arsenic]] and in despair, Colt enlisted in the [[United States Marine Corps]].  His orders were for a Mediterranean cruise on the ''[[U.S.S. Constitution]]''; illness prevented him from serving on the ship and he worked as a clerk in [[Norfolk, Virginia|Norfolk]], [[Virginia]] for Colonel Anderson.<ref name=Edwards/>

Colt spent three months as a Marine and was disillusioned with the military lifestyle; clerking in a humid port was not the adventurous life he had envisioned. He was still very ill, but not ill enough for a medical discharge, so he forged a letter in the name of "George Hamilton", a farmer from [[Ware, Massachusetts|Ware]], [[Massachusetts]], stating that his underage son had falsely enlisted under the name of John Colt.  He mailed the letter to his brother James and asked him to mail it to Colonel Anderson from Ware.  Anderson discharged Colt within days of receiving the letter, citing Colt's illness as the reason and not fraudulent enlistment.<ref name=Edwards>{{Harv|Edwards|1953|pp=165<U+2013>166}}</ref>

Upon his discharge, Colt spent a year as a law clerk for his cousin, [[Dudley Selden]].  At the same time he became a river boat gambler and was challenged to a duel over a shared mistress.  Although the two never fought the duel, this incident would become part of Colt's [[backstory]] as a roughneck, street fighting gambler.  He traveled to [[Vermont]] in 1830 as a debate coach for the [[University of Vermont]], at [[Burlington, Vermont|Burlington]]; however, he left after a year due to symptoms of [[tuberculosis]].  Colt then traveled to the [[Great Lakes]] for relief from the disease and bought a farm in [[Michigan]] on Gooden's Lake; however, tubercular symptoms surfaced again and he soon left for [[Cincinnati]], [[Ohio]], where he became a teacher of one of the first [[correspondence course]]s in America, center of a [[Bohemianism|Bohemian circle]] and counted [[John Howard Payne]] and [[Hiram Powers]] among his friends.<ref name =hs198>{{Harv|Schechter|2010|p=198}}</ref>

From there he attempted many business ventures throughout the United States: land speculator in [[Texas]], soap manufacturer in New York, grocery wholesaler in Georgia, fur trader, dry-goods merchant in [[Florida]], and an organizer of [[Mardi Gras]] [[masquerade ball]]s in [[New Orleans]].<ref name =hs55>{{Harv|Schechter|2010|p=55}}</ref>

==Double-entry bookkeeping==
While teaching in [[Louisville]] in 1834, Colt began lecturing on "Italian Book-keeping", or [[Double-entry bookkeeping system|double-entry bookkeeping]].<ref>{{cite journal|title= John C. Colt|journal=Dividend| volume= 5|publisher= Graduate School of Business Administration, University of Michigan.|year= 1973|pages=27<U+2013>29}}</ref>  He toured the United States giving a series of lectures on the topic and by 1837 began writing a textbook on the subject.<ref>{{cite book|title =The Italian science of double-entry book-keeping: simplified, arranged and methodized |first= John Caldwell |last=Colt|publisher= N. G. Burgess & Co.|year=1838 }}</ref>

His text book, ''The Italian science of double-entry book-keeping: simplified, arranged and methodized'', received praise and glowing reviews.  Colt had the book published in [[Boston]], New York, [[Philadelphia]], and Cincinnati.  By 1839 over 200 schools were using the textbook.  Colt dropped "Italian" from the title for the second edition and included transcripts of his lectures in the newer editions; the book went through 45 printings and was in publication until 1855.<ref>{{cite book|title =The science of double-entry book-keeping: simplified, arranged and methodized |first= John Caldwell |last=Colt|publisher= N.

Stone|journal=The Accounting Historians Journal|volume=12|issue= 1 |year= 1985|pages= 121<U+2013>130}}</ref>

Shortly after publishing the first edition of his textbook, Colt went into partnership with the publisher, Nathan G. Burgess as Colt, Burgess & Co in [[Cincinnati]], Ohio.  The new firm almost went bankrupt after publishing ''An Introduction into the Origin of Antiquities in America'' by John Delafield Jr.  The scholarship of the text was dubious and the book was available by subscription only.  Hoping for a better market for Delafield's book, Colt moved to 14 Cortland Street in [[Manhattan]], New York in 1839.  The office doubled as Colt's residence and Colt made his own shipping crates for the books within it.<ref name =hs83>{{Harv|Schechter|2010|p=83}}</ref>

==Murder of Samuel Adams==
[[File:Adams-Box.jpg|thumb|Authorities open the crate containing the body of Adams, <U+2013> Sutton 1874]]
On September 17, 1841, a New York printer named Samuel Adams went to see Colt to collect a debt over some textbooks that Adams had printed for him.  The two disagreed over the final amount owed; sources indicate that it was a discrepancy of $1.35.<ref>{{cite book|title=Pleasantries about courts and lawyers of the state of New York |first= Charles |last=Edwards |page=320|publisher =Richardson & company|year= 1867 |quote=But the remainder as he had it, fifty-seven dollars and fifteen cents, should have been fifty-five dollars and eighty cents.  This last sum I insisted upon being the amount I owed him for his last printing, which he denied.  You will see, for the paltry sum of one dollar and thirty-five cents the quarrel ensued.}}</ref> According to Colt, Adams began choking him with his [[cravat]]. In self-defense, Colt reached for what he thought was a hammer to fend him off, but the weapon turned out to be a [[hatchet]].<ref name=Tucher101>{{Harv|Tucher|1994|p=101}}</ref>  Colt struck Adams four or five times with the weapon, causing Adams to drop to the floor.<ref name=Tucher101/>

After Colt realized that he had killed Adams, he cleaned up the blood. On the morning of September 18, Colt placed Adams' corpse into a large shipping crate and packed it with salt.  He then addressed it to a phony address in New Orleans and hired a car-man named Barstow to deliver it to a ship named the ''Kalamazoo'', scheduled to leave the next morning.<ref name=Lawson460>{{Harv|Lawson|1914|p=460}}</ref>

After being missing for over 24 hours, Adams' family began searching the city for him, placing notices in several newspapers such as the ''[[New York Courier and Enquirer]]'' and the ''[[New York Tribune|New York Weekly Tribune]]'' notifying people he was missing. A neighbor of Colt's, Asa H. Wheeler, told Adams' father-in-law, Joseph Lane, that he had heard noises in Colt's office that sounded like a fight followed by a crash to the floor. Peering in the keyhole, he saw someone "bending over something on the floor".  Wheeler later secured a key from the landlord and saw that a large packing crate was missing and that the floor had been scrubbed. On September 22, 1841, Colt visited Adams' print shop inquiring about the status of his books and the whereabouts of Adams.<ref name=Tucher99>{{Harv|Tucher|1994|pp=99<U+2013>100}}</ref><ref name=Lawson467>{{Harv|Lawson|1914|p=467}}</ref> Adams' bookbinder, Charles Wells, told Colt that Adams had last been seen going to see Colt. Colt made no reply to this allegation and excused himself.<ref name=Schechter126>{{Harv|Schechter|2010|p=126}}</ref>

Lane, Wheeler, and an employee of Adams named John Loud examined Adams' ledgers for any transactions involving Colt and went to the mayor of New York City, [[Robert H. Morris (mayor)|Robert Hunter Morris]], with the evidence.<ref name=Schechter125>{{Harv|Schechter|2010|p=125}}</ref> Other witnesses said that Adams was last seen entering Colt's apartment on September 17 and that Colt had a crate delivered by a carman the next day.<ref name=Lawson455>{{Harv|Lawson|1914|p=455}}</ref>  The mayor asked the Superintendent of Carts, William Godfrey, to locate the carman in question and find out the location of the crate.  Godfrey found Barstow who told him the parcel had been delivered to a freighter named the ''Kalamazoo''.<ref name=Schechter130>{{Harv|Schechter|2010|p=130}}</ref>

The ''Kalamazoo'' was still in port because a storm had prevented it from sailing.  New York Police and the Mayor of New York boarded the ship with the carman who had delivered the crate and asked if it was still in the cargo hold.  The decomposing body had begun to give off a strong odor that ship hands had assumed was a poison put out to kill rats.  When asked to open the crate, [[stevedore]]s complied and the contents were a half-naked male corpse wrapped in a shop awning, bound with rope and packed with salt.  A scar on the body's leg and a single gold ring identified the body as Adams.<ref name=Lawson455/>

==Arrest and trial==
Colt was arrested on September 23 by New York Police and the city's mayor.<ref name =Tucher99/>  Adams' gold pocketwatch engraved with an image of the [[US Capitol]] was found among his possessions.<ref name=dunphy294>{{Harv|Dunphy|1867|p=294}}</ref>  The trial began on January 13, 1842.  Colt was represented by a team of three attorneys led by his cousin [[Dudley Selden]] (under whom he had clerked), John Morrill and Robert Emmett. The three were paid in stock from Samuel Colt's new company: Patent Arms Manufacturing Company of Paterson, New Jersey.<ref name=Tucher105/>  The Chief Prosecutor was [[James R. Whiting]], the [[New York County District Attorney]].  The presiding judge was William Kent.<ref name =hs129>{{Harv|Schechter|2010|p=129}}</ref>
===Tried by the press===
The Colt-Adams Murder trial dominated the popular press at the time,<ref name=walsh/>  and eclipsed coverage of another New York murder, that of [[Mary Rogers]]. The press depicted Colt as a former professional riverboat gambler who had public affairs with women and a [[common-law]] wife and who committed perjury to enlist in and exit the Marines.<ref>{{cite book|title=Industrializing antebellum America: the rise of manufacturing entrepreneurs in the early republic |first= Barbara M. |last=Tucker|coauthors=Kenneth H.

Barnum]] purchased from the ''Albany Evening Atlas'' as a picture of Adams.<ref name =hs239>{{Harv|Schechter|2010|p=239}}</ref>  Religious magazines such as ''[[The Catholic Herald]]'', ''Evangelical Magazine'', ''Episcopal Recorder'' and ''[[Gospel Advocate]]'' used the story to demonstrate such problems as the "lack of morality in the home".<ref name =hs234>{{Harv|Schechter|2010|p=234}}</ref>

Throughout the trial Colt was repeatedly found guilty of "cold-blooded murder" in the New York press.<ref name=Tucher102/>  The October 30 issue of the weekly ''Tribune'' quoted James Colt, then practicing law in St Louis as saying "insanity is hereditary in our family".<ref name=Tucher102/>  [[James Gordon Bennett, Sr.|James Gordon Bennett]] wrote lengthy editorials in the ''[[New York Herald]]'' about Colt's "confidence, assurance, and impudence" and that his "limitless potential has been undermined by a want of moral and religious culture".<ref name =hs260>{{Harv|Schechter|2010|p=260}}</ref>  The major exception was ''[[The Knickerbocker]]'' in which [[Lewis Gaylord Clark]] reported the murder as a "misfortunate accident".<ref name=hs234/>  Colt's lawyers continually petitioned Judge Kent to forbid press coverage, but Kent refused them saying, "The Court has done everything to prevent the jury from being influenced from without".<ref name=Tucher102/>
===Murder weapon===
[[File:Paterson.jpg|thumb|left|Colt was incorrectly believed to have used one of his brother's revolvers in Adams' murder.]]
Halfway through the trial, Whiting made allegations that Adams had been murdered with a [[Colt Paterson]] revolver rather than a hatchet.<ref name=Lawson471/>  Whiting came to this conclusion after Doctor Gilman, who examined the body with the coroner, testified about a round hole in Adams skull that could not have been made by the hatchet and suggested that Colt used a revolver in a premeditated act by which he lured Adams to his death.<ref name=Tucher246/>  Although no witnesses had reported the sounds of gunfire, Whiting's argument was that a revolver ball fired under the power of the [[percussion cap]] alone could propel the ball with "enough force to kill a man", without making the noise of the exploding [[black powder]] in the cylinder.<ref name=Tucher246/>  Several witnesses were called in to testify against this idea including an early [[ballistics|ballistician]] named Zabrisky and Samuel Colt himself, who demonstrated to the court, by shooting his revolver in the courtroom and catching the fired balls in his hand, that such a shot could not penetrate to the depth of the wound found on Adams' skull.<ref name=Lawson471/><ref name=Tucher246>{{Harv|Tucher|1994|p=246}}</ref> 

Over Selden's objections, Whiting had the coroner, David L. Rogers, bring Adams' skull and the hatchet into the courtroom to show the jury the direction and number of strikes made.  John Colt was reported as "covering his face" at this demonstration.<ref name=Lawson471>{{Harv|Lawson|1914|pp=471<U+2013>472}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Trial of John C. Colt for the Murder of Samuel Adams|location= New York|publisher= The Sun|date= January 31, 1842|page=1}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Colt Case|location= New York|publisher= New York Herald |date=January 28, 1842|page= 1}}</ref> The cylindrical wound which Whiting and Gilman thought was made by a ball fired from a revolver was actually caused by one of the nails used by Colt to seal the crate.<ref name=Tucher246/>  Gilman conceded that the wound was caused by a nail and admitted that no foreign object such as a ball from a revolver was found in the victim's head.<ref name=Lawson471/>

Colt admitted he had killed Adams and  planned to confess before he was arrested.  He attested that he acted in [[self-defense]].<ref name=Lawson485/>
{{imagequote2|I then sat down, for I felt weak and sick. After sitting a few minutes, and seeing so much blood, I think I went and looked at poor Adams, who breathed quite loud for several minutes, then threw his arms out and was silent.

Colt<ref name =hs205>{{Harv|Schechter|2010|p=205}}</ref>}}
Colt said his first thought was to burn down the building to destroy the evidence, but reconsidered as a number of people lived in the building and rather than "cause more carnage" he reconsidered.  He then decided to dispose of the body in a large packing crate and wrapped it in an awning and bound it with rope.  After scrubbing the floor he threw Adams' clothing into a nearby outdoor [[Outhouse|privy]], then stopped at the Washington [[Public bathing|bathhouse]] on Pearl Street to wash the blood from his clothes and hands.<ref name=Tucher102>{{Harv|Tucher|1994|p=102}}</ref>

===The verdict===
Closing arguments were made on January 23. Selden argued that Colt had acted in self-defense as Adams had been choking him and Colt's only means to defend himself was to grab a nearby weapon.  His defense for hiding the body was [[temporary insanity]].<ref name=Lawson485>{{Harv|Lawson|1914|p=485}}</ref>  Whiting countered in a two-hour long rebuttal that the killing was premeditated; he pointed to Colt's demeanor at the trial, the taking of Adams' watch, the leaving of a hatchet in plain view, and Colt's method of disposing of the body as evidence contradicting Colt's claim that his actions were that of an innocent man acting in self-defense.<ref name=dunphy279>{{Harv|Dunphy|1867|p=279}}</ref>  Judge Kent dismissed the argument for self-defense based on Colt's attempted cover-up and instructed the jury that since Colt had confessed to the murder that they were to determine whether the charge should be murder or [[manslaughter]].  Kent remarked on Colt's "careless air" demonstrated throughout the trial in the courtroom and said his behavior was "not typical of an innocent man".<ref name=Tucher105>{{Harv|Tucher|1994|p=105}}</ref>  The jury was disturbed by Colt's demeanor throughout the trial, agreeing with the judge that Colt appeared stoic, unremorseful and callous when describing his disposal of Adams' body.<ref name=Tucher104/>  On January 24, after deliberating for over 10 hours, the jury found Colt guilty of [[premeditated murder|willful murder]].<ref name=Lawson507>{{Harv|Lawson|1914|pp=507<U+2013>508}}</ref>

Colt's team requested an appeal and argued the case on May 5, 1842, asking for a new trial as the jury at the previous was misinformed; on May 12 a new trial was denied so the lawyers appealed to the [[New York Court for the Trial of Impeachments|State Supreme Court]] located in [[Utica, New York]].  The State Supreme Court heard the case on July 16, 1842 and upheld the earlier court's decision.  Colt's sentencing date was scheduled for September 27, 1842.<ref name=Lawson507/>  Undaunted, Colt's lawyers recruited Rogers, the surgeon who performed Adams' autopsy "to investigate the probable relative position and actions" of Colt and Adams during their struggle.<ref name =hs248/>  By analyzing the number, shape, and position of the wounds and the blood splatter; Rogers deduced that the two "grappled face to face within a foot-and-a-half of each other" and "Adams was in an erect position at the time the fatal blows were inflicted.<ref name =hs248/>  The report was submitted to Governor [[William H. Seward]] in the hope of securing a pardon for Colt.<ref name =hs248>{{Harv|Schechter|2010|p=248}}</ref>  Seward was overwhelmed with requests asking for a pardon for Colt, including those from 36 lawyers who visited him personally in Albany as well as from judges and attorneys close to Seward such as Judge [[Ambrose Spencer]] and former Attorney General [[Willis Hall (New York)|Willis Hall]].<ref name =hs268>{{Harv|Schechter|2010|p=268}}</ref>  Seward in the end would not pardon Colt, as he felt the attempted cover-up of the crime and Colt's demeanor throughout the trial were not the actions of a "penitent man".<ref name =hs271/>

==Marriage and death==
[[File:ColtWedding.jpg|thumb|Depiction of Colt's wedding in prison from an 1874 text]]
On September 28, 1842, after exhausting his final appeal, Colt was sentenced to death by hanging and remanded to New York City's infamous prison, the [[The Tombs| Tombs]]. His sentence was to be carried out on November 14, 1842. Colt asked that he be allowed to marry Caroline Henshaw on the morning of his hanging. While imprisoned, Colt lived luxuriously in his prison cell, receiving daily visits from friends and family, smoking Cuban cigars, sleeping in an actual bed instead of a mound of straw and wearing silk dressing gowns inside and a seal skin overcoat for his daily walks in the prison yard.  His cell contained the latest novels, a gilded bird cage with a canary and fresh flowers brought to him every day by Henshaw.<ref name =hs245>{{Harv|Schechter|2010|p=245}}</ref><ref name =ed180/>  He dined on meals from local hotels such as quail on toast, game pates, reed birds, and [[Ortolan Bunting|ortolan]]s.<ref name =ed180>{{Harv|Edwards|1953|p=180}}</ref>  Several attempts were made to break him out of the prison by dressing him in women's clothing but all these efforts were foiled.<ref name=dunphy305/><ref name =hs284>{{Harv|Schechter|2010|p=284}}</ref>  A doctor was hired who claimed he could resuscitate Colt from the hanging, providing the body did not remain suspended long, as he believed Colt's neck to be of such thickness that strangulation would be impossible.<ref name=dunphy305>{{Harv|Dunphy|1867|p=305}}</ref>  Colt's friends put the doctor up in the Shakespeare Hotel on the morning of the scheduled hanging and planned to bring the body there from the Tombs for resuscitation.<ref name=dunphy305/>

On the morning of November 14, 1842, Colt and Henshaw were married in the prison at a small ceremony conducted by Rev Henry Anthon, an Episcopal Minister, and witnessed by Samuel Colt and [[John Howard Payne]].  After the ceremony and a few hours before the scheduled execution, a fire broke out in the Tombs. After the fire was extinguished, Colt's body was found in his cell.  He had stabbed himself in the heart with a [[pocketknife|clasp knife]], believed to have been smuggled to him by a family member.<ref name=Lawson511>{{Harv|Lawson|1914|p=511}}</ref>  His body was taken by Rev Anthon and buried in the churchyard of [[St. Mark's Church in-the-Bowery]].<ref name=Meyer/>

===Aftermath===
As the trial had made headlines in the daily newspapers, so did Colt's death.  Theories were put forth that Colt had killed another prisoner and escaped during the fire.<ref>{{cite book|title=All Around the Town: Amazing Manhattan Facts and Curiosities  |first= Patrick|last=Bunyan|page=92|publisher =Fordham University Press|year= 1999 |isbn=9780823219414}}</ref>  One newspaper account said that Colt had fled to California with his wife, as did a book published by a former New York Chief of Police.<ref>{{cite book|title=Recollections Of A New York Chief Of Police  |first= George Washington|last=Walling |page=26|publisher =Caxton book concern, limited|year= 1887 |quote=I have heard it declared over and over again, by those in a position to know, that Colt did not commit suicide; that the body found in his cell when the Tombs caught fire was only a corpse prepared for the purpose, and that he escaped in the confusion.

Colt historian William Edwards wrote that Caroline Henshaw married Samuel Colt in Scotland when Colt met her in Europe and that the son she bore was Samuel Colt's and not John Colt's.<ref name=Edwards181>{{Harv|Edwards|1953|p=181}}</ref> In a 1953 biography about Samuel Colt based largely on family letters, Edwards wrote that Samuel's marriage to Caroline was a way to legitimize her son, Sammy, as Samuel felt she was not fit to be the wife of an industrialist and divorce was a social stigma at the time.<ref name=Edwards181/>   Samuel Colt took care of the child named Samuel Caldwell Colt financially with a large allowance and paid for his tuition in what was described as "the finest private schools".  In correspondence with and about his namesake, Samuel Colt referred to him as his "nephew" in quotes.  Historians such as Edwards and [[Harold Schechter]] have said this was the elder Colt's way of letting the world know that the boy was his own son without directly saying so.<ref name=Schechter310/> After Samuel Colt's death in 1862, he left the boy $2 million by 2010 standards.  Colt's widow, Elizabeth Jarvis Colt, and her brother contested this.  In probate Caroline's son Sam produced a valid marriage license showing that Caroline and Samuel Colt were married in Scotland in 1838 and that this document made him a rightful heir to part of Colt's estate, if not to the [[Colt Manufacturing Company]].<ref name=Edwards181/><ref name=Schechter310>{{Harv|Schechter|2010|p=310}}</ref>

Author [[Herman Melville]] made an allusion to the case in his short story ''[[Bartleby the Scrivener]]''. In that story, the narrator restrains his anger toward Bartleby, his unrelentingly difficult employee, by reflecting upon "the tragedy of the unfortunate Adams and the still more unfortunate Colt and how poor Colt, being dreadfully incensed by Adams ... was unawares hurled into his fatal act."<ref>{{cite book| last=Melville |first=Herman |authorlink=Herman Melville |title=Bartleby the Scrivener| year=1853}}</ref><ref name="Schechter 2010">{{Harv|Schechter|2010}}</ref>

[[Edgar Allen Poe]]'s ''[[The Oblong Box (short story)|The Oblong Box]]'', published in 1844, tells of the shipboard transport of a corpse in a wooden box packed with salt. The story may have been inspired by Colt's method of disposing of Adams' corpse, which Schecter calls "the single most macabre element of the Colt case."<ref name=walsh/><ref name="Schechter 2010"/><ref>{{cite journal|journal=American literature: a journal of literary history, criticism and bibliography Modern Language Association of America.
