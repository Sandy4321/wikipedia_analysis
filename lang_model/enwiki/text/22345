{{for|other uses of the name|Battle of New Orleans (disambiguation)}}

"'''The Battle of New Orleans'''" is the name of a song written by [[Jimmie Driftwood]]. The song details the 1815 [[Battle of New Orleans]] from the perspective of an American fighting alongside [[Andrew Jackson]] against British forces, but the tone is lighthearted. It has been recorded by many artists, but the one most often associated with this song is [[Johnny Horton]]. His version, released as a single in [[1959 in music|1959]], topped the [[Billboard Hot 100]].

==History==
The melody has its roots in a well-known American [[Old time music|fiddle tune]] ''The 8th of January'', which was the date of the Battle of New Orleans. Jimmie Driftwood, a school principal in [[Arkansas]] with a passion for [[history]], set a historical account of the battle to this music in an attempt to get students interested in learning history. It worked, and Driftwood became well known in the region for his historical songs. He was "discovered" in the late 1950s by [[Don Warden]], and eventually signed to a recording contract by RCA, for whom he recorded 12 songs in [[1958]], including ''The Battle of New Orleans''.

''The Battle of New Orleans'' is often played during [[North America]]n sporting events, and is commonly heard during home games of the [[NHL]]'s [[Calgary Flames]].

==Other versions==
===Covers and remakes===

As noted, Johnny Horton's 1959 version is the best-known. Horton also recorded an alternative version for release in British Commonwealth countries which had more favourable lyrics toward the British.  The word "British" was replaced with "Rebels" along with a few other differences.

Many other artists have recorded this song. Notable versions include the following:
*In the [[United States]], [[Vaughn Monroe]]'s 1959 single competed with Horton's, but did not achieve the same degree of success and became only a minor Hot 100 hit.
*In the [[United Kingdom]], [[Lonnie Donegan|Lonnie Donegan and His Skiffle Group]]'s 1959 version competed with Horton's and achieved greater success. It peaked at number two.
*[[Harpers Bizarre]] had a minor Hot 100 hit with their somewhat psychedelic version from their [[1968 in music|1968]] album [[Secret Life of Harpers Bizarre]].
*[[Johnny Cash]] in 1972 on the album ''America: A 200-Year Salute in Story and Song''.
*[[Nitty Gritty Dirt Band]] had a minor Hot 100 hit with their version in [[1974 in music|1974]]
*[[Bill Haley & His Comets|Bill Haley]] recorded a version in 1979 at his final recording sessions and it was released on his final album, ''Everyone Can Rock and Roll''.
* The Les Humphries Singers recorded the same song in the Seventies under the title "Mexico", violating copyright by crediting the song to Humphries.
* Perhaps the most unexpected recording is [[The Mormon Tabernacle Choir]]'s 1991 cover on their album [[Songs from America's Heartland]].
