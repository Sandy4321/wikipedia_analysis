"'''Take It Off'''" is a song by American recording artist and songwriter [[Kesha]], from her debut album, ''[[Animal (Kesha album)|Animal]]''. The song was written by Kesha Sebert, [[Dr. Luke|Lukasz Gottwald]] and [[Claude Kelly]] and it was produced by [[Dr. Luke]] with vocal editing done by Emily Wright. It was released as the fourth and final single from the album on July 13, 2010. "Take It Off"'s initial writing consisted of Kesha attending a drag show and becoming turned on by drag queens taking their clothing off. The song is an upbeat dance pop song that uses heavy amounts of auto tune and utilizes an electro infused beat.

Critical reception of the song has been mixed to positive. A complaint amongst critics was the demonstration of overly processed vocals with the use of [[auto-tune]]. Other critics felt the song was a strong, irresistible [[dance-pop]] number that contained a carefree message. Due to strong digital sales from the release of ''Animal'', the song charted in the United States, the United Kingdom and [[Canada]] before being announced as a single. After being released as a single the song reached the top ten in Canada, Australia and the United States. With the song reaching the top-ten in the United States, Kesha became only the eleventh artist in history to amass four top-tens from a debut album. As of February 2011, "Take It Off" has sold over two million copies in the United States.

Two music videos for the single were released. The first video features Kesha and her friends on a distant planet, dancing around in a [[moshing|mosh pit]] while slowly turning into stardust as the video progresses. The inspiration for the video, according to Kesha, was about shedding your inhibitions and being "raw and real." The second video released for the song features [[Jeffree Star]] and incorporates a more dominant animal theme, while drawing from 80s themed inspiration such as: ''[[Tron]]'', [[David Bowie]] in ''[[Labyrinth (film)|Labyrinth]]'', and ''[[Revenge of the Nerds]]''. To promote the single Kesha performed "Take It Off" alongside earlier singles "[[Your Love Is My Drug]]" and "[[Tik Tok]]" on [[NBC]]'s ''[[Today (U.S. TV program)|The Today Show]]''.

==Writing and inspiration==
"Take It Off" was written by Kesha, alongside Dr. Luke and Claude Kelly. It was recorded at [[Conway Recording Studios]] in [[Los Angeles]], [[California]], and at Dr. Luke's studio in that city. The song was produced by Luke with vocal editing done by Emily Wright. During an interview with ''[[Esquire (magazine)|Esquire]]'' magazine Kesha was asked about her song writing process and used "Take It Off" as an example of how her songs come to fruition. She explained that the song came about when she was out one night and was visiting a transsexual bar, stating, "I have a song [...] called 'Take It Off' about when I went to a drag show, and how really turned on I was by these transvestite men taking clothes off. I was like, What does that even make me?".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.esquire.com/the-side/qa/kesha-pics-081309?click=main_sr|title=Kesha and the Not-Quite-72 Virgins in Her Own Personal Heaven|author=Sullivan, Matt|date=August 13, 2009|work=Esquire|publisher=[[Hearst Corporation]]|accessdate=2010-07-15}}</ref>

Amar Toor from [[AOL Radio]] gave the song a positive review saying, "Much like the rest of the album, this new song is simply made for the dance floor. And, much like Kesha herself, the track seems to embody relentless, carefree hedonism at its best." He also noted, "And when Kesha talks about a 'place I know', where 'they go hardcore and there's glitter on the floor' in the style of a six-grade camp ditty, it's hard for anyone to not feel the urge to just take it off."<ref name="Aol">{{cite web|url=http://www.aolradioblog.com/2010/06/15/kesha-take-it-off/|title=Kesha, 'Take It Off' <U+2013> New Song|author=Toor, Amar|date=June 15, 2010|work=AOL Radio|publisher=AOL Inc|accessdate=2010-06-15}}</ref> Bill Lamb of [[About.com]] gave the single four out of five stars. He was concerned with the overall lyrical depth and over-use of auto-tune but he complimented the song for its "irresistibly catchy beat and chorus" with a "celebratory mood of dropping inhibitions."<ref name=AboutTake/> He noted that "with the volume turned up and the chorus encouraging you to 'take it off,' you may just feel inspired to follow the commands.

Newman wrote that "thinking too much is what gets Kesha, who co-wrote the songs here, in trouble.

Monica Herrera from ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' magazine criticized the song for its demonstration of overly processed vocals noting how easily an artist can "get lost in a sea of auto-tone".

He commented on the choice of the single, noting "the glimpses of emotion shown on her last offering, 'Your Love Is My Drug', are as long gone as her sobriety."

The video starts off with Kesha seen on a motorcycle. She proceeds to walk as her friends follow behind her as they enter a motel area. As the chorus of the song starts, Kesha and her friends start to run around the motel dancing and jumping off railings. The friends gather around an empty pool and start tearing at each other's clothing; While this is happening it is revealed they that are on a different planet and Kesha is seen rolling around in sand. Slowly as some of the friends start taking off their clothing, they begin to turn into star dust. The group starts to dance in the pool with some of the party goers exploding into dust. The remainder of the friends continue to dance in the dust that is now covering the bottom of the pool. As this is happening they all begin to lose different parts of their bodies as they explode into multicolored star dust. The video ends with everyone as dust with Kesha beginning to "unzip" herself as she turns into yellow dust.

Jocelyn Vena of [[MTV News]] met the video with a positive review. She noted that Kesha "manages to embrace her inner party animal and throw a neon-colored party at an abandoned motel in the middle of nowhere." She stated that "While the concept of "a lot of pretty people dancing at dusk" is pretty simple, the neon colors manage to amp up the video, as does the colored sand that's thrown around in the air and mixed with glitter." Her conclusion of the video and of Kesha was that as simple as it may be, "she manages to be both sexy and fun while rolling around in the desert."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1645043/20100804/_kesha_.jhtml|title=Kesha Throws A Desert Party In 'Take It Off' Video|date=August 3, 2010|author=Vena, Jocelyn|work=MTV News|publisher= MTV Networks (Viacom)|accessdate=2010-08-04}}</ref> Melinda Newman of HitFix criticized the video's first half, calling it "predictable."

The video begins with a scene of a [[leopard]] with glowing blue eyes (later revealed to be Kesha) walking down an alleyway. The song's title flashes on the screen and the video pans to Kesha. She walks down the alleyway with two men who grab another man. Kesha spray-paints a dollar sign on his chest. They come to a party where she and her friends flash their tattooed dollar signs on their wrists and forearms in order to enter. As they enter, everyone starts dancing and the party-goers' faces are shown changing into different animals'. In the following scene, Kesha is seen sitting on a chair with two men by her side. [[Jeffree Star]] then approaches Kesha.<ref name= "NYB"/> Kesha and Star engage in a choreographed dance battle; Star then shoots Kesha with a laser chain saw which she deflects with her bracelet, Kesha responds by shooting lasers out of her hands, killing Star. After the battle the party-goers crawl around Kesha and she is seen holding a gold cup with a blue foaming liquid spilling over the top of the glass. As Kesha gives the party goers a drink, their faces turn into different kinds of animals. The video ends with everyone dancing and turning into half animal humans, Kesha however, drinks from the cup and turns back into a leopard.

==Live performances==
