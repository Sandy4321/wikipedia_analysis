==Early life==

It is known that he graduated with an MD, though which school is not known. He travelled to [[New South Wales]] in the late 1830s, and moved to [[North Auckland Peninsula|North Auckland]] in January 1840. He was a witness to the proceedings of the [[Treaty of Waitangi]].

On 18 May 1846, he married Jane Henderson, the daughter of an officer of the [[Royal Navy]] (Lieutenant Essex, RN, of [[Demarara]]). He moved with her to [[Kawau Island]] in 1847, after becoming medical officer to a [[Scotland|Scottish]] copper-mining company.

==Entry into politics==
Pollen spent several years on Kawau, during which time he began to contribute articles to the New Zealander supporting the agitation for responsible government. He was also to the fore in supporting temperance, scientific, and library movements there.

===Auckland Province===
When the [[New Zealand Constitution Act 1852]] became law, Pollen was made chief clerk in the Auckland Superintendent's office. From there, he rose through the ranks. Two years after his original appointment, he was appointed Executive; in 1856 he was elected to the [[Auckland Province|Auckland Provincial Council]]; in 1858 he was appointed Commissioner of Crown Lands for Auckland; in 1861, he was called to the Legislative Council as a representative. In 1862, he resigned as Commissioner of Crown Lands, and became the Deputy Superintendent of Auckland, where he served until the end of his second term.

In 1867, he resigned from the Legislative Council to become agent for the Central Government at Auckland. He returned to the Legislative Council in June 1868 to represent the Stafford Ministry. 

In 1870, Daniel Pollen held four positions - Receiver of Land Revenue, Commissioner of Confiscated Lands, Commissioner under the Native Land Act of 1870, and Immigration Officer. 

===Premier of New Zealand===
The [[Julius Vogel|Vogel]] Government recalled him to the Legislative Council in 1873, where he immediately became [[Colonial Secretary (New Zealand)|Colonial Secretary of New Zealand]] until 1877, when he became the Premier for less than a year. After he left this position, he served in the Legislative Council for 19 years until his death.
