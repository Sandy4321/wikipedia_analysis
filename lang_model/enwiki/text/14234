'''Charlotte "Charlie" Buckton''' is a [[character (arts)|fictional character]] from the Australian [[Seven Network|Channel Seven]] [[soap opera]] ''[[Home and Away]]'', played by [[Esther Jackie Anderson|Esther Anderson]]. Anderson was added to the cast in a bid to add more "sex appeal" to the show. She said it was her dream job and relocated to Sydney immediately to accommodate filming. The character made her on-screen debut during the episode airing on 6 June 2008. Charlie was billed as having a "warm heart" and being "family oriented", however her actions are often misunderstood and her persona has been perceived as "brash". She is described as being "passionate about her work" and often neglects her daughter, [[Ruby Buckton|Ruby]]'s ([[Rebecca Breeds]]) needs. Charlie's first notable storyline was a lesbian relationship with [[Joey Collins]] ([[Kate Bell]]). The storyline was implemented by producers to boost ratings and Anderson said it helped portray Charlie's vulnerable side. The storyline angered Christian and conservative oriented family groups. They complained that ''Home and Away'' had featured sexualised plot lines unsuitable for children and Channel Seven was inundated with parental complaints stating that children should not be exposed to same-sex relationships in a family show. Viewership declined after transmission of the storyline and producers cut scenes to attune to viewers wishes, which outraged the [[LGBT]] community. The storyline came to a natural end and Anderson and executive producer [[Cameron Welsh]] praised the plot because it portrayed a real-life situation and denounced the conservative views as outdated. Anderson stated that the storyline was a great to portray in terms of acting.

Charlie's sexuality was sidelined and she began a relationship with [[Angelo Rosetta]] ([[Luke Jacobz]]). Through out their romance Charlie played out various family oriented plots and was described as having strong feelings for him. Their romance was portrayed to be wayward and unstable. In 2011, their relationship ended after producers felt there were no more storylines to give to the pair. Charlie later develops feelings for [[Darryl Braxton]] (Steve Peacocke). Another notable storyline for the character saw her reveal that her supposed sister, Ruby, was in fact her daughter. Anderson said the filming process was challenging as they felt the need to get the story right. Viewers sympathised with Charlie and saw a "beautiful element" in the portrayal. The revelation ruined the on-screen relationship between Charlie and Ruby, and was never repaired. Charlie has received critical analysis through her storylines and persona and opinion has been mixed. Ruth Deller of [[Lowculture]] said Charlie had endured "scandalous-headline-grabbing-faux-lesbianity", whilst [[Holy Soap]] stated that she has a "questionable taste in men." Charlie has been ill received by Jaci Stephen of the ''[[Daily Mail]]'' because of her on-off relationship with Angelo and Stephen regularly expresses her general dislike of the character in her column. In contrast, the ''[[Daily Star (United Kingdom)|Daily Star]]'' liked Charlie's image, which they branded "sexy", and the ''[[Daily Record (Scotland)|Daily Record]]'' praised her for the drama she creates. Anderson's portrayal of Charlie has seen her earn various award nominations, including the "[[Gold Logie Award for Most Popular Personality on Australian Television|Most Popular Personality on Australian Television]]" and "Most Popular Actress" [[Logie Awards]].

She cares about Ruby more than life itself and is responsible for her, so these are priorities over a finding a man. I don't think it's a matter of need for her but she definitely would like someone to share her life with and that romantic element is a good balance in Charlie's somewhat serious life."<ref name=llanelli>{{cite news|title=Home And Away's Esther on romance|url=http://www.thisissouthwales.co.uk/news/Home-Away-s-Esther-romance/article-874047-detail/article.html|work=[[Llanelli Star]]|publisher=[[Northcliffe Media]]|accessdate=19 February 2011|date=5 April 2009<!-- |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5wcG1S8Ey|archivedate=19 February 2011-->}}</ref>

In 2009, ''Home and Away'' producers introduced a storyline that saw Charlie begin a relationship with another woman.

Upon the announcement of the storyline, church and conservative family groups attacked the plot.

The show's series producer Cameron Welsh and Anderson both spoke out in defence of the storyline. Welsh said, "The idea of this show has always been that we hold a mirror to society <U+2013> and when society changes, we change with it. What's ahead in ''Home and Away'' is right not only for the series, but also for the times we are living in".<ref name="Defend">{{cite news|url=http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/entertainment/tv-star-esther-anderson-producer-cameron-welsh-defend-lesbian-plot/story-e6frewyr-1225700314562|title=TV star Esther Anderson, producer Cameron Welsh defend lesbian plot|date=21 April 2009|work=[[The Daily Telegraph (Australia)|The Daily Telegraph]]|publisher=[[News Limited]]|accessdate=23 July 2010}}</ref> Anderson said that she felt it was the right time to tell this story and added, "It's really important for us to reflect society, and this storyline is what is going on for many people in real life".<ref name="Defend"/> She also said that she did not think the plot would be so shocking, but was glad the show was exploring a gay relationship.<ref name="Defend"/>

===Relationship with Angelo Rosetta===
Charlie's relationship with [[Angelo Rosetta]] ([[Luke Jacobz]]) has been a focal point in her storylines. They originally date, but break up after Angelo kills [[Jack Holden]] ([[Paul O'Brien]]).

Breeds added "Ruby just wants to get some security back, everything she thought her life was is totally up in the air". Ruby becomes confused and starts to ask herself questions such as "Where do I stand now?" and "How do I reconcile this?" Breeds said it was a "big exploration" and a journey for Ruby, with Anderson agreeing.<ref name=lskd/> Anderson felt there was a beautiful element to the storyline and opined: "Although it is tragic, you feel sorry for Charlie and you can sort of understand where it has all come from."<ref name=lskd/> She added that everyone feels sorry for Ruby, meaning neither are wrong. Furthermore she said, "You are just rooting for them, you just want them to get back to how they were and it is a bit of a journey."<ref name=lskd/> Comparing the storyline to the lesbian plot she said, "Perhaps this storyline was a little bit harder, you've seen the start of this storyline and there is a lot more to come and it wasn't easy."<ref name=lskd/>

Charlie later struggles to deal with Ruby's relationship with [[Casey Braxton]] (Lincoln Younes).<ref name=eggfe/> Discussing Charlie's motives, Anderson stated: "Ruby's at that age where she is quite impressionable, and Charlie doesn't want to see her getting hurt. She's only very recently been in a relationship with [[Romeo Smith]] ([[Luke Mitchell (actor)|Luke Mitchell]]), and Charlie is concerned about her moving from one guy to the next too quickly."

[[Image:Cdev.jpg|thumb|right|120px|[[Catherine Deveny]] criticised the reaction to Charlie's lesbian plot]]
[[Holy Soap]] described the character's most memorable moment as "Locking lips with gal pal Joey".<ref name="HolyC"/> 
In her book ''Free to a Good Home'', author [[Catherine Deveny]] criticised the reaction to Charlie and Joey's same sex relationship. She called the first kiss between the couple the "TV disapointment of the year" and she nicknamed the soap ''Homo Go Away'' because the scene in which the kiss featured were diluted to suit certain viewers.<ref name="Deveny">{{cite book|last=Deveny|first=Catherine|authorlink=Catherine Deveny|title=Free to a Good Home|accessdate=6 April 2011|year=2009|publisher=Black Inc.|isbn=978-1-86395-455-6|page=141}}</ref> Of the decline in ratings during the storyline, Deveny said "Since the lesbian plotline began two weeks ago, 100,000 people have turned off. Wow! Turned off. That must be the first time the words 'lesbian' and 'turn off' have occurred in the same sentence. And all we'd seen until Tuesday was lingering touches and intense stares."<ref name="Deveny"/> Deveny then explained that she would rather let her children watch lesbians on television than Christians. She then highlighted that only mothers complained to the network about their children being exposed to a same-sex relationship during a family show, not fathers.<ref name="Deveny"/>

In September 2010, the Holy Soap website ran a poll to find viewers' favourite ''Home and Away'' couple, which Charlie and Angelo won with 45% of the vote. The website branded them as the "The Bay's criminally hot couple" and said they had been keeping viewers glued to their screens with their on/off-relationship.<ref name=hsoap>{{cite web|title=The Bay's criminally hot couple|url=http://holysoap.channel5.com/news/the-bays-criminally-hot-couple-9709?view_image=3|work=[[Holy Soap]]|publisher=[[Channel 5 (UK)|Channel 5]]|accessdate=27 March 2011|date=15 September 2010<!--|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5xVGjFJRG|archivedate=27 March 2011-->}}</ref> They later said Charlie had a "questionable taste in men".<ref name=cvazs>{{cite web|title=Double trouble for Charlie|url=http://holysoap.channel5.com/news/double-trouble-for-charlie-13044|work=[[Holy Soap]]|publisher=[[Channel 5 (UK)|Channel 5]]|accessdate=27 March 2011|date=23 March 2011<!--|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5xVPWbY9Q|archivedate=27 March 2011-->}}</ref> Peter Dyke, writing for British tabloid the ''[[Daily Star (United Kingdom)|Daily Star]]'', branded Charlie as "Sexy" and states: "Most fellas would not mind feeling the strong arm of the law if this beauty was their local police officer."<ref name="starzz">{{cite news| url=http://www.dailystar.co.uk/playlist/view/174409/Home-Away-Cop-this-/|title=Home & Away: Cop this!|accessdate=19 February 2011|author=Dyke, Peter|date=31 January 2011|work=[[Daily Star (United Kingdom)|Daily Star]]|publisher=[[Northern & Shell]]<!-- |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5wcD31ady|archivedate=19 February 2011-->}}</ref> The ''[[Daily Record (Scotland)|Daily Record]]'' opined that Charlie's determination to prove Grant as a rapist was "dangerously close to an obsession."<ref name=dailz>{{cite news|title=Soap Watch|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/SOAP+WATCH.-a0209935326|work=[[Daily Record (Scotland)|Daily Record]]|publisher=[[Trinity Mirror]]|accessdate=16 March 2011|date=18 October 2009}}</ref> They also said that ever since Charlie and her family arrived in Summer Bay they have "created drama."<ref name=wth>{{cite news|title=Bad news for Ross|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Bad+news+for+Ross%3b+HOME+AND+AWAY+WEEKDAYS%2c+FIVE%2c+6pm.-a0189577152|work=[[Daily Record (Scotland)|Daily Record]]|publisher=[[Trinity Mirror]]|accessdate=27 March 2011|date=22 November 2008}}</ref> 

The character was negatively received by Ruth Deller of television website [[Lowculture]] and Jaci Stephen of the ''[[Daily Mail]]''. In May 2009, Deller placed Charlie at number five on her list of worst soap opera characters segment.<ref name="May">{{cite web|url=http://lowculture.co.uk/index.php/2009/05/31/soapstar-superstars-may/|title=Soapstar Superstars <U+2013> May|last=Deller|first=Ruth|date=31 May 2009|publisher=[[Lowculture]]|accessdate=21 July 2010}}</ref> Deller said, "The Summer Bay cop may have lots of storylines, but the LC community don't really approve <U+2013> mainly due to Esther Anderson's apparent lack of acting chops.
