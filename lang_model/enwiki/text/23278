== History ==
In August 1997, ''XXL'' released its first issue. It featured rappers [[Jay-Z]] and [[Master P]] on a double cover.<ref>http://www.xxlmag.com/news/2013/08/drake-on-the-cover-of-xxls-150th-issue/</ref> In December 2006, ''XXL'' took over the struggling hip hop producer and DJ magazine ''[[Scratch (magazine)|Scratch]]'' (another publication owned by Harris Publications), re-branding it as ''XXL Presents Scratch Magazine''. However ''Scratch'' shut down less than a year later in September 2007. Other titles with limited runs have been launched under the ''XXL'' brand, including ''Hip-Hop Soul'', ''Eye Candy'' and ''[[Shade 45|Shade45]]''. ''XXL'' has released many other special projects including tour programs, mixtapes and exclusive DVDs. ''XXL'' also maintains a popular website, which provides daily hip hop news, original content and content from the magazine.<ref>http://www.xxlmag.com/</ref>

In 2013, ''XXL'' started their own annual awards. With the top 5 being chosen by a public vote and all other winners and nominees picked by the XXL staff.

==Special releases==
[[Image:XXL Presents Shade 45 magazine cover.jpg|right|150px|thumb|Magazine cover of ''XXL Presents Shade 45'']]
In August, 2005, [[Eminem]] and ''XXL'' teamed up to release a special issue titled ''XXL Presents Shade 45'', and was designed to give maximum exposure to [[Shade 45]] as a [[radio station]], and at the same time give maximum exposure to the [[Shady Records]] label as a whole, as well as the radio [[Disc jockey|DJ]]'s and [[G-Unit Records]]' artists. ''XXL'' executive Publisher, Jonathan Rheingold, stated that typically magazines based around particular artists were not favorable, but "since Shade 45 is a truly authentic and uncensored rap radio channel, the marriage with the ''XXL'' brand made sense," with the feeling that it is what would interest rap fans.<ref>Carl Chery (August 23, 2005).
