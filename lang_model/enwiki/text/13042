The '''54th Boat Race''' took place on 3 April 1897.  [[The Boat Race]] is an annual [[Rowing (sport)#Side by side|side-by-side rowing]] race between crews from the Universities of [[University of Oxford|Oxford]] and [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]] along the [[River Thames]].  Oxford went into the race as reigning champions, having won the [[The Boat Race 1896|previous year's race]].  The crews were almost evenly matched weight-wise, Oxford marginally the heavier, whose crew consisted almost entirely of veterans of the event.  In a race umpired by former rower [[Frank Willan (rower)|Frank Willan]], Oxford won by two-and-a-half lengths in a time of 19 minutes 12 seconds, the victory taking the overall record to 31&ndash;22 in their favour.  It was Oxford's eighth consecutive victory and the third fastest winning time in the history of the event.

==Race==
[[File:University Boat Race Thames map.svg|right|thumb|[[The Championship Course]], along which the race is conducted]]
As a result of their impressive performances during the build up to the race, Oxford were clear favourites to win.<ref>Drinkwater, pp. 103&ndash;104</ref>  Cambridge won the [[coin flipping|toss]] and elected to start from the Middlesex station, handing the Surrey side of the river to Oxford.  The race was started at 2:24 p.m. in a light breeze from the east on a favourable tide.<ref name=drink104>Drinkwater, p. 104</ref>  The Light Blues made the quicker start, with [[Sroke (rowing)#Stroke seat|stroke]] William James Fernie taking his crew off at 41 [[stroke rate|strokes per minute]].  Within a quarter of a mile, Cambridge held a half-length lead but the Dark Blues began to draw back into contention and took the lead just before [[Craven Cottage]].<ref name=drink104/> 

A spurt at the Mile Post from the Light Blues kept them in touch but Oxford rowed away from them, taking a clear water advantage by [[Hammersmith Bridge]], effectively ending the contest.  Oxford extended their lead "as they liked" and passed the finishing post two and a half lengths clear of Cambridge, in a winning time of 19 minutes 12 seconds.<ref name=drink104/>  It was Oxford's eighth consecutive victory and was, at the time, the third fastest winning time in the history of the event.  It took the overall record to 31&ndash;22 in Oxford's favour.<ref name=results/>
