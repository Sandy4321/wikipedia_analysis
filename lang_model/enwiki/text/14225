'''Norsk Spisevognselskap A/S''', often abbreviated '''NSS''' or shortened to '''Spisevognselskapet''', was a [[Norway|Norwegian]] [[government-owned corporation|state enterprise]] that operated [[restaurant car]]s in [[rail transport in Norway|Norwegian trains]], as well as restaurants at [[train station]]s and [[railway hotel]]s. The company was established in December 1918 and started a catering service in 1919. Originally owned by the [[Hoved Line|Norwegain Trunk Railway]], in 1926 it was acquired by the state. The prices of the meals served in the restaurant cars were relatively expensive, although the cars were accessible for all passengers. In the 1950s, the company started using serving trolleys on the trains.

The company was [[Mergers and acquisitions|merged]] with the convenience store chain [[Narvesen|Narvesen Kioskkompani]] in January 1975, into a new company which was named Narvesen<U+2013>Spisevognselskapet. This company was partly owned by the [[Norwegian State Railways]] and [[Fritt Ord (organization)|Fritt Ord]], before it was merged with the [[Reitan Group]] and delisted from the [[Oslo Stock Exchange]].

==Background==
[[File:Spisevognbergensbanen.jpg|thumb|left|A restaurant car of a train on the [[Bergen Line]] in 1909]]
From the 1854 establishment of railways in Norway to 1909, no dining service was offered on board trains. Passengers were instead free to bring food with them. Also stations lacked dining services. The first dining service was started by restaurateur Carl Christiansen.<ref>Just (1949): 13</ref> He had established the restaurant at [[Drammen Station]], and in 1907 was asked by NSB to establish a dining service on board the express trains on the [[Bergen Line]], which would open in 1909. After investigating similar operations in England and Germany, he ordered two carriages from [[Skabo Jernbanevognfabrikk]].<ref>Just (1949): 14</ref> These were to be paid for by the state, but the [[Parliament of Norway]] delayed the grants after a longer debate regarding if it was suitable to have dining cars on trains. The plans were opposed by the [[teatotler]] fraction in parliament, but there was a majority in favor of dining services. To get the carriages in time, Christiansen personally guaranteed for the production cost in case a state grant was not allocated. After the parliamentary decision, the cost of the carriages was refunded by NSB.<ref>Just (1949): 15</ref> In 1910, when the [[President of the United States]], [[Theodore Roosevelt]], visited [[Oslo]] to receive the [[Nobel Peace Prize]], several restaurant cars were ordered solely for the occasion. Two years later, restaurant cars were put in regular service on the [[<U+00D8>stfold Line]].{{r|arkivmagasinet}}

==Establishment==
[[File:Norsk Spisevognselskap at Oslo <U+00D8>.jpg|thumb|A restaurant car of Norsk Spisevognselskap at [[Oslo East Station]] in 1935]]
In 1916, the executive board of the state railways wanted to centralise the operation of restaurant cars and the most important station restaurants in Norway under one management. The board stated that they wanted to minimise the conflict of interests between the railway company and the dining car operator. They also saw centralising operations as a way to allocate a larger share of the revenue to the railway company, and to ensure the high quality of service on new lines.<ref>Just (1949): 22</ref> At the time, the [[S<U+00F8>rland Line]] and [[Dovre Line]] were under planning, and NSB planned to introduce dining services on these when they opened.<ref>Just (1949): 28</ref> [[Oslo East Station]] was operated by the private [[Hoved Line|Norwegian Trunk Railway]], including the station's restaurant. In an agreement signed on 18 September 1918, the two railway companies agreed that a new restaurant operator would be controlled by the Norwegian Trunk Railway, but that this company would have to abide by NSB's decision as to how many dining cars to operate on any line.<ref>Just (1949): 23</ref>

The model was inspired from Sweden, where a separate dining company had also been established, and where this company paid the railway company both part of its revenue and a fixed fee per dining car. The Swedish model involved including the operation of the station restaurants at locations where the dining cars would have depots.<ref>Just (1949): 29</ref> On 21 December 1918, A.S Norsk Speivogselskap was established with a share capital of 200,000 [[Norwegian krone]] (NOK). It had 20 shares, with 17 being owned by the Trunk Railway, and one by each of the three directors; [[Waldemar Stoud Platou]], [[Gotfred Furuholmen]] and [[Christian Emil Stoud Platou]], the former representing the Trunk Railway and the latter director-general of NSB.<ref>Just (1949): 24</ref> In January 1919, Waldemar Platou was appointed chair and Christiansen managing director. The company took over Christiansen's four dining cars and the restaurant at Oslo <U+00D8> on 1 April 1919.<ref>Just (1949): 27</ref>

On 2 February 1926, parliament voted to [[nationalise]] the Trunk Railway. During the debate, the organisation of Spisevognselskapet was critisised. With the nationalisation, the state became the sole owner of Spisevognselskapet. On 31 March 1927, the [[Ministry of Labour (Norway 1885<U+2013>1946)|Ministry of Labour]] recommended that the company remain a state-owned limited company; the minority in parliament wanted a state enterprise.<ref>Just (1949): 31</ref> During the 1930s, [[Sigurd Astrup]] was managing director of Norsk Spisevognselskap.{{r|SigurdAstrup}} In 1948, [[Erling Mossige]] was appointed managing director of the company. He was succeeded by [[Knut Tvedt]] in 1960.{{r|ErlingMossige}} The company had 75 employees in 1919, and 591 in 1949.{{r|arkivmagasinet}}

==Dining cars==
[[File:Norsk Spisevognselskap dining in 1947.jpg|thumb|left|Dining in 1947]]
The restaurant cars of NSS were accessible to everyone, but the dining was so expensive that only passengers travelling on first class used the service. Usually, three or four dishes were offered in the restaurant cars. A four-course dinner cost five [[Norwegian kroner]] in the 1920s, which was expensive for its time.{{r|arkivmagasinet}} Warm dishes, such as soups and sauces were usually prepared at a small stove in the restaurant car's kitchen. On busy days, prepared steaks were delivered from rail depots. The kitchens were staffed by two maids and one attendant. Blocks of ice were often used instead of [[refrigerator]]s.{{r|arkivmagasinet}}

With the opening of the Dovre Line, Spisevognselskapet established a dining car service on the route from 25 June 1921.<ref name=j39>Just (1949): 39</ref> In 1921, a train ride from Kristiania to [[Trondheim]] lasted approximately 15 hours, and the average halting time at each station was between 10 and 15 minutes.{{r|arkivmagasinet}} On 1 July 1925, dining services were introduced on the [[Valdres Line]], from 1 July 1926 on the [[Brevik Line]], from May 1934 on the [[Nordland Line]] and from 15 May 1936 on the [[R<U+00F8>ros Line]]. In 1948, 210,000 meals were served on board, in addition to sandwiches and drinks. The company also offered light breakfasts on night trains on the [[Kongsvinger Line]], the <U+00D8>stfold Line and the Dovre Line.<ref name=j39 /> During the entire [[Second World War]], the dining car service was discontinued.

After the [[Second World War]], the train faced competition from [[aviation]] and car traffic, and serving trolleys were installed on the Norwegian trains.{{r|arkivverket}} In 1965, the cart service in the trains was centralised and standardised, so that food service could go faster. The prices were also lowered. In the 1970s, cafeteria cars were put up, where passengers could serve themselves.{{r|arkivmagasinet}}

==Restaurants==
[[File:Bjorli restaurant.jpg|thumb|The restaurant at [[Bjorli Station]]]]
The company had most of its revenue from the operation of restaurants at railway stations; in 1939, this accounted for 80 percent.<ref>Just (1949): 49</ref> Initially the company operated the restaurant at Oslo <U+00D8>; from 1921, the company also took over operation of the restaurants at [[Oslo Vestbanestasjon|Oslo West Station]], [[Hamar Station|Hamar]], [[Koppang Station|Koppang]], [[Oppdal Station|Opdal]] and [[Elverum Station|Elverum]]. The following year, four more restaurants were added: [[St<U+00F8>ren Station|St<U+00F8>ren]], [[Myrdal Station|Myrdal]], [[Dokka Station|Dokka]] and [[Hell Station|Hell]]. The company also established its first kiosk, at [[Bergen Station]].<ref>Just (1949): 50</ref> In 1923, the company was given permission to take over all restaurants in the railway districts of Oslo and Hamar; by 1925, the company had taken over operations of the restaurants at [[Lillehammer Station|Lillehammer]], [[H<U+00F8>nefoss Station|H<U+00F8>nefoss]], [[Jessheim Station|Jessheim]], [[Kornsj<U+00F8> Station|Kornsj<U+00F8>]], [[Halden Station|Halden]], [[Ski Station|Ski]], [[Eidsvoll Station|Eidsvoll]], [[Otta Station|Otta]], [[Domb<U+00E5>s Station|Domb<U+00E5>s]], [[<U+00C5>ndalsnes Station|<U+00C5>ndalsnes]], [[Kongsvinger Station|Kongsvinger]], [[Trondheim Central Station|Trondheim]], [[Rena Station|Rena]], [[Roa Station|Roa]], [[Ringebu Station|Ringebu]], [[Bjorli Station|Bjorli]] and [[Finse Station|Finse]].<ref name=j51>Just (1949): 51</ref>

After this, the company decided not to take many additional restaurants, as the company did not see any strategic value of these.<ref name=j54>Just (1949): 54</ref> From 1930 through 1934, the company took over the restaurants at [[<U+00C5>l Station|<U+00C5>l]], [[Jaren Station|Jaren]], [[Lillestr<U+00F8>m Station|Lillestr<U+00F8>m]] and [[T<U+00F8>nsberg Station|T<U+00F8>nsberg]], along with the dining service on the steam ship ''[[Skibladner]]'', which ran on [[Mj<U+00F8>sa]].<ref name=j51 /> During the first half of the 1940s, the company again acquired new restaurants, including at [[Kristiansand Station]].<ref name=j54 /> In 1940 and 1941, the company made a solid profit, but lack of food from onwards from 1942 turned the result to a loss.<ref>Just (1949): 55</ref> During the late 1940s, the company also took over the restaurants at [[Drammen Station|Drammen]] and [[Sarpsborg Station|Sarpsborg]], as well as the one at [[Oslo Airport, Fornebu]].<ref>Just (1949): 72</ref>

==Hotels==
[[File:Oppdal Turisthotell.jpg|thumb|left|The hotel at [[Oppdal Station]]]]
In 1919, the Norwegian Trunk Railway operated one hotel, which was built as part of [[Eidsvoll Station]]. The operations of the 20-room hotel was taken over by Spisevognselskapet on 14 October 1924.<ref name=j76>Just (1949): 76</ref> NSB was at the time building the Dovre Line between Oslo and Trondheim, and was considering establishing hotels in the areas the line passed through [[Dovrefjell]]. Both [[Hjerkinn Station|Hjerkinn]] and Fokkstua were considered, but these areas were instead served by other operators.<ref>Just (1949): 73</ref>{{r|adressa08082009}} Instead, Spisevognselskapet established Oppdal Tourist Hotel adjacent to [[Oppdal Station]]. It was taken into use on 28 June 1924.<ref name=j76/>{{r|norskreisebok|adressa19042008|adressa04052006}} The 60-bed hotel had a floor area of {{convert|605|m2}}<ref>Just (1949): 79</ref> and was marketed as a tourism destination with [[bobsleigh]] and [[curling]] during winter and tennis and croquet during summer.<ref>Just (1949): 80</ref> The hotel was closed for part of 1929 because the municipality would not give permission to serve alcoholic beverages.<ref>Just (1949): 82</ref>

In Oslo, the company had its offices and workings spread around town. The main depot was at the East Station, while the head office variously was located in Fred. Olsens gate 21 from 1919 to 1921, in Kongens gate 29 to 1932, and in Tollbodgaten 24 until 1938. Management wanted to centralise both a new depot and the administration at a single location, close to the railway station, and preferably co-located with a hotel. In 1936, work started to establish a hotel at [[Jernbanetorget]], but this work was cancelled.<ref name=j91>Just (1949): 91</ref> The proposed hotel would have had 100 rooms and been across the street from Oslo <U+00D8>. However, the plans were stopped by parliament, who were opposed to the state railway operating hotels.<ref name=j93>Just (1949): 93</ref>  Instead, the administration moved into Nylandsveien 10,<ref name=j91 /> in a new building built on a lot owned by NSB.<ref name=j93 />

In Bergen, the company established Hotel Terminus Bergen along with other investors, but the hotel failed to make any money.<ref>Just (1949): 74</ref> In the late 1940s, the company bought Grand Hotell Bellevue in [[<U+00C5>lesund]], and later also operated Saltfjellet Tourist Hotel for a short period.{{r|vertskap}} In 1952, Oslo Municipality's [[Hotel Royal Christiania|Viking Hotel]] was completed, and Spisevognselskapet was selected as the operator.{{r|vg02081951}} They remained as the hotel's operator until 1976, when the municipality sold it to Eiendomsinvest, who outbid Spisevognselskapet by a few million krone.{{r|vg11091976}}

==Disestablishment==
[[File:Spisevogn carriage.jpg|thumb|A dining car in 1926]]
[[Narvesen]] had an exclusive agreement with NSB to operate [[newsagent's shop]]s at all railway stations, except in connections with restaurants, which were operated by Spisevognselskapet. Narvesen had a near-monopoly on newsagent in Norway, and rented facilities on many public places. The owners of Narvesen were intending to create a foundation to own the company; when planning of this started in 1972, they had difficulties finding a way of transferring the shares to the foundation without having to pay tax on the transaction. However, the tax laws permitted a tax-free transaction if it was part of a restructuring.<ref>Skedsmo (1993): 134</ref> A merger with Spisevognselskapet would be considered a restructuring, and in 1974 [[Fritt Ord (organization)|Fritt Ord]] was established to take over Narvesen's owners share of the company. The agreement between Narvesen and NSB was made in July 1974, and in December it was passed by parliament, although the [[Conservative Party (Norway)|Conservative Party]] and [[Progress Party (Norway)|Progress Party]] voted against the merger. A.S Narvesen<U+2013>Spisevognselskapet was established on 1 January 1975. The new company was owned 50% by Fritt Ord and 41% by NSB. It took the name Narvesen from 1979.<ref>Skedsmo (1993): 135</ref>

By the late 1980s, the company had sold all its hotel operations.{{r|vertskap}} The merged company retained the obligations to operate the dining services on the trains, which through the 1980s became in need for considerable subsidies from NSB. In 1988, NSB decided to organize the operation of the dining services through [[tendered]] contracts; the first contract, from 1990 through 1995, was won by TogService, a Narvesen subsidiary.<ref>Skedsmo (1993): 136</ref> The owners had an agreement that neither could sell without the approval of the other. In 1995, NSB, with approval of Fritt Ord, sold their shares and the company became listed on [[Oslo Stock Exchange]].{{r|frittord}}

In 1999, Fritt Ord reduced its stock share in Narvesen from 51 to 34 percent. In the autumn of 2000, Fritt Ord accepted a proposal of merging Narvesen with the [[Reitan Group]]. The merged company was named ReitanNarvesen, with Fritt Ord having 16.2 percent of the stock share.{{r|arkivmagasinet}} In November 2001, Fritt Ord sold its complete stock share in ReitanNarvesen,{{r|ntb15112001}} which changed name to Reitan Handel{{r|ntb18022002}} and was delisted from the Oslo Stock Exchange.{{r|ntb11012002}}
