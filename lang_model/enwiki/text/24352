'''Herbert Tremenheere "Herbie" Hewett''' (25 May 1864 <U+2013> 4 March 1921) was an English [[History of English amateur cricket|amateur]] [[cricketer]] who played for [[Somerset County Cricket Club|Somerset]], [[Captain (cricket)|captaining]] the county from 1889 to 1893, as well as [[Oxford University Cricket Club|Oxford University]] and the [[Marylebone Cricket Club]].  A battling left-handed [[Batting order (cricket)#Opening batsman|opening batsman]], Hewett could post a large score in a short time against even the best bowlers. Capable of hitting the ball powerfully, he combined an excellent eye with an unorthodox style to be regarded at his peak as one of England's finest batsmen.

Hewett was educated at [[Harrow School]], won a [[Blue (university sport)|Blue]] at [[Oxford University|Oxford]] in 1886 and played for Somerset from 1884. As an inconsistent middle-order batsman he made little impact during this period. Even so, he was appointed captain of Somerset in 1889. Over the next two years, his leadership and performances as an opening batsman were instrumental in the county regaining [[First-class cricket|first-class status]] and admission to the [[County Championship]] in 1891. He remained Somerset captain for a further three seasons, usually opening the batting with [[Lionel Palairet]]. In 1892, [[Partnership (cricket)|they shared a partnership]] of 346 for the first wicket, of which Hewett scored 201. The stand remains the county's highest first-wicket partnership.<ref group="n" name="asof">As of February 2011.</ref> In that season, Hewett made 1,405 runs at an [[Batting average#Cricket|average]] of more than 35, and was named as one of the "[[Wisden Cricketers of the Year|Five Batsmen of the Year]]" by ''[[Wisden Cricketers' Almanack|Wisden]]''. [[England cricket team|England]] did not play any [[Test cricket|Test matches]] at home in 1892, or else Hewett would probably have won a Test [[Cap (sport)|cap]]; instead his highest accolade was being selected to play for the [[Gentlemen v Players|Gentlemen against the Players]] at [[Lord's Cricket Ground|Lord's]] in 1894. A disagreement over whether play should take place on a sodden pitch in the match against the [[Australia national cricket team|Australians]] in 1893 led to Hewett's departure from Somerset at the end of that season.

He played first-class cricket for three more years, during which time he scored centuries against both Oxford and [[Cambridge University Cricket Club|Cambridge Universities]], appearing for a variety of amateur and representative sides. Having been selected to captain an "England XI" at [[Scarborough, North Yorkshire|Scarborough]] in 1895, Hewett was involved in another incident caused by a wet pitch. Feeling insulted by shouts of derision from the crowd, he left the match at lunch-time on the first day. He made only one further first-class appearance: playing for the Marylebone Cricket Club against Oxford University in 1896. Hewett practised as a [[barrister]], having been [[Call to the Bar|called to the Bar]] at the [[Inner Temple]].

Hewett led his side in their first County Championship match starting on 18 May 1891. Although the club had played first-class cricket a few years earlier, the championship had only been formed the previous season. Their debut in the competition was interrupted by rain and finished a draw; Hewett top-scored in Somerset's only innings with 31.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/3/3669.html |title=Middlesex v Somerset |publisher=CricketArchive |date=1891-05-18 |accessdate=2010-10-12}}</ref> Somerset's next match was against reigning county champions [[Surrey County Cricket Club|Surrey]].

==Touring North America==

==Departure from Somerset==
Hewett began the 1893 season in good form, reaching his half-century in each of his first three matches for the county, including a total of 94 against Oxford University in late May.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/3/3945.html |title=Oxford University v Somerset |publisher=CricketArchive |date=1893-05-29 |accessdate=2010-10-16}}</ref> Hewett missed most of the match against Kent shortly after, returning to Taunton due to the death of his brother-in-law, during which time [[George Wood (Somerset cricketer)|George Wood]] replaced him as a [[Substitute (cricket)|substitute]].<ref name="kent1893">{{cite web|url=http://www.cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/3/3980.html |title=Kent v Somerset |publisher=CricketArchive |date=1893-06-29 |accessdate=2010-10-16}}</ref> In July 1893, the touring [[Australia national cricket team|Australians]] played Somerset at Taunton for the first time since 1882, when both the ground and the county team were barely established. After the success of the 1892 season, and because talented, Australian-born Sammy Woods was playing for Somerset, the match was eagerly anticipated. Thousands arrived in Taunton for the match, but after overnight torrential rain, the [[Umpire (cricket)|umpires]] inspected the pitch at 11:00 and abandoned play for the day. In his history of the county club, Roebuck suggest that they may have been put under pressure by the Australians or by Hewett himself.<ref name="roebuck6667">Roebuck (1991), pp. 66<U+2013>67.</ref> The Somerset fans and members were angry at the decision, but the Australians packed picnic baskets and after exchanging strong words with the locals, departed for the [[Quantock Hills]].<ref name="foot4245">Foot (1986), pp. 42<U+2013>45.</ref> Hewett, along with Woods and [[Vernon Hill (cricketer)|Vernon Hill]], arranged to play golf in [[Minehead]].<ref name="woods5152">Woods (1925), pp. 51<U+2013>52.</ref> The crowd continued to show their dismay at the decision, and eventually the Somerset officials asked the umpires to take another look at the ground. Woods supported this decision in his reminiscences, claiming that "the decision not to play was premature."<ref name="woods5152"/> At 14:00, after their second inspection, the umpires retracted their previous decision and announced that play could start. Hewett reacted angrily, and argued unsuccessfully against the decision with the Somerset committee. The Australian players were recalled from their picnic, and play began at 16:00, although neither team particularly wanted to play. Roebuck recorded that "Hewett, in particular, was in high dudgeon and... he threw away his wicket for 12 runs, having been dropped once."<ref name="roebuck6667"/> David Foot offered a more tempered opinion, saying simply that Hewett's "mind wasn't on the game."<ref name="foot4245"/> No play was possible on the second day, and on the third, Australia won the match by six wickets.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/4/4004.html |title=Somerset v Australians |publisher=CricketArchive |date=1893-07-20 |accessdate=2010-10-16}}</ref> Hewett felt let down by the Somerset committee, who he felt had undermined his authority, prompting him to say that "if a captain can't lead at Taunton, this is no place for him."<ref name="foot4245"/> Although friends thought he was overreacting, he declared that he would resign from the captaincy and the club at the end of the season.<ref name="roebuck6667"/> Both Foot and Roebuck suggested that Hewett reacted in an over-sensitive and extreme manner, but that his lack of self-control may have limited his long-term captaincy prospects.<ref name="roebuck6667"/><ref name="foot4245"/>

In his five further games for Somerset before the end of the season Hewett hit two centuries. He reached 120 runs against [[Nottinghamshire County Cricket Club|Nottinghamshire]] <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/4/4038.html |title=Somerset v Nottinghamshire |publisher=CricketArchive |date=1893-08-21 |accessdate=2010-10-16}}</ref> and against [[Gloucestershire County Cricket Club|Gloucestershire]], on his final appearance for the county, he scored 112 runs in just under two hours; according to ''[[James Lillywhite's Cricketers' Annual]]'', it "was a splendid display".<ref>{{cite book |title=[[James Lillywhite's Cricketers' Annual]] |publisher=James Lillywhite, Frowd & Co. |location=[[London]] |year=1894 |page=90 |editor1-last=Alcock |editor1-first=Charles William}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/4/4045.html |title=Somerset v Gloucestershire |publisher=CricketArchive |date=1893-08-28 |accessdate=2010-10-16}}</ref> He scored 1,092 runs in total during 1893, of which his 669 for Somerset in the championship were scored at an average of 31.85, topping the county's batting charts.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cricketarchive.com/Archive/Events/ENG/County_Championship_1893/Somerset_Batting.html |title=Batting and Fielding for Somerset: County Championship 1893 |publisher=CricketArchive |accessdate=2010-10-16}}</ref> During his five seasons of first-class cricket for Somerset, he played 51 matches and scored 2,592 runs at an average of 30.85.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cricketarchive.com/Archive/Players/3/3615/f_Batting_by_Team.html |title=First-class Batting and Fielding For Each Team by Herbie Hewett |publisher=CricketArchive |accessdate=2010-10-16}}</ref>

==Later cricket career and life==
After leaving Somerset, Hewett did not continue in county cricket at all, opting to play first-class cricket only for amateur and representative sides.<ref name="fcm"/> At the tail-end of the 1893 season, he played three times for the South, scoring two half-centuries.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/4/4050.html |title=Yorkshire v South |publisher=CricketArchive |date=1893-08-31 |accessdate=2010-10-16}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/4/4052.html |title=South v Australians |publisher=CricketArchive |date=1893-09-07 |accessdate=2010-10-16}}</ref> In July 1894, Hewett made the second of his two appearances for the [[Gentlemen v Players|Gentlemen]] against the Players. Unlike his first appearance, made at [[Central Recreation Ground, Hastings|Hastings]], the match was played at [[Lord's Cricket Ground]],<ref name="fcm"/> which was generally considered to be the more prestigious Gentlemen v Players fixture of the season, being the more representative.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Altham |first1=H.S. |authorlink1=Harry Altham |last2=Swanton |first2=E.W. |authorlink2=E.W.

Woods described Hewett as being "in splendid form" when he played, and lamented that he was no longer playing for Somerset.<ref>Woods (1925), p. 58.</ref> He scored his only century of the season for A. J. Webbe's XI, reaching 110 after opening the innings against Oxford University.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/4/4112.html |title=Oxford University v AJ Webbe's XI |publisher=CricketArchive |date=1894-05-21 |accessdate=2010-10-16}}</ref> He continued his form with the bat into 1895, twice scoring centuries for the Gentlemen against the universities, making 109 against Cambridge,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/4/4301.html |title=Cambridge University v Gentlemen of England |publisher=CricketArchive |date=1895-05-20 |accessdate=2010-10-16}}</ref> and 102 against Oxford.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/4/4311.html |title=Oxford University v Gentlemen of England |publisher=CricketArchive |date=1895-05-23 |accessdate=2010-10-16}}</ref> During this season Hewett appeared in his first match for the amateur side [[I Zingari]], who had strong links with both [[Harrow School]] and Somerset president Sir [[Spencer Ponsonby-Fane]].<ref name="fcm"/>

Hewett played all three matches of the 1895 Scarborough Festival; he opened the innings for the MCC against Yorkshire, and then captained the South in their loss against the North. In the third match, Hewett was named captain of an England XI, a compliment for the former Somerset captain. However, rain meant that the start was delayed. Unlike a couple of years earlier, Hewett was happy to ignore the puddles in the field and start the match at the scheduled time. The umpires disagreed with him, and the crowd, wanting cricket, blamed Hewett for the delay and lack of sport. When he belatedly led his side onto the field, the spectators threw insults at him until the Yorkshire captain, Lord Hawke, shouted "Keep quiet or I'll think about calling the game off".<ref name=f45>Foot (1986), p. 45.</ref> Hewett did not bother with such threats, and left the field, got changed and departed from the ground, taking no further part in the game.<ref name=f45/> [[Fred Spofforth]] replaced him in the match which the England side went on to win by nine wickets.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/4/4460.html |title=Yorkshire v England XI |publisher=CricketArchive |date=1895-09-05 |accessdate=2010-10-16}}</ref>

During the English winter of 1895<U+2013>96, Hewett once again toured with Lord Hawke, travelling to [[South Africa]]. Arriving too late to take part in the first match of the tour,<ref>{{cite book |title=Cricket: A Weekly Record of the Game |page=11 |volume=XV |publisher=Merritt & Hatcher |location=London |editor1-last=Alcock |editor1-first=Charles William |date=1896-01-30}}</ref> he then played the next four matches,<ref name="om"/> but was summoned back to England by important business.<ref>{{cite book |title=The Complete History of Cricket Tours at Home and Abroad |year=1989 |last1=Wynne-Thomas |first1=Peter |authorlink1=Peter Wynne-Thomas |page=42| publisher=Guild Publishing |location=London}}</ref> The tour included three matches against a [[South Africa national cricket team|South African national team]] which were deemed to be [[Test cricket|Tests]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Seasons/RSA/1895-96_RSA_Lord_Hawkes_XI_in_South_Africa_1895-96.html |title=Lord Hawke's XI in South Africa 1895/96 |publisher=CricketArchive |accessdate=2010-10-16}}</ref> but by this stage of the tour Hewett had left South Africa, and he thus completed his cricket career without any Test appearances.<ref name="caprofile">{{cite web|url=http://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Players/3/3615/3615.html |title=Player Profile: Herbie Hewett |publisher=CricketArchive |accessdate=2010-10-16}}</ref> He played his final first-class match in 1896, scoring 86 for the MCC against Oxford University.<ref name="fcm"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/4/4580.html |title=Marylebone Cricket Club v Oxford University |publisher=CricketArchive |date=1896-06-29 |accessdate=2010-10-16}}</ref> In this match, for unknown reasons, he appeared as "Mr. H Herbert".
<blockquote>"When Mr 'Herbert' came in to bat ... many of the spectators in the free seats did not recognise him, but after he had sampled an over or two, an old gentleman, who had shown some knowledge of the game, hit the nail on the head when he remarked: I don't remember to have seen this Mr 'Erbert' before but he's 'class'."<ref>{{cite book |title=Cricket: A Weekly Record of the Game |pages=257<U+2013>259 |publisher=Merritt & Hatcher |location=London |editor1-last=Alcock |editor1-first=Charles William |volume=XV |date=1896-07-02}}</ref></blockquote> He continued to play cricket for the Harrow Wanderers, MCC and I Zingari until 1901.<ref name="om"/> At the time of the [[United Kingdom Census 1901|1901 Census]], Hewett was living in [[Westminster]].

Hewett practised as a [[barrister]], having trained at the [[Inner Temple]], where he passed at least one exam in 1890. During the First World War, he served in the [[Territorial Force|Territorial Force Reserve]] as an Assistant [[Provost Marshal]], an appointment which he held from 7 September 1915 until 24 May 1918.<ref>{{London Gazette |issue=29321 |supp=yes |startpage=9994|date=8 October 1915}}</ref><ref>{{London Gazette |issue=30773 |supp=yes |startpage=7707|date=28 June 1918}}</ref> He died in [[Hove]], [[Sussex]] on 4 March 1921,<ref name="caprofile"/> and his funeral was held in Norton Fitzwarren four days later. His obituary in ''[[The Times]]'' describes only Hewett's cricket career, and does not give any details about his later life. It does not mention a spouse or any children.<ref name="timesdn"/>

==Personality and style==
When Hewett was named as one of the Five Batsmen of the Year by ''Wisden Cricketers' Almanack'' in 1893, the publication described him as "the finest left-handed batsman in England".<ref name="boty"/> He played in an unorthodox but attractive fashion, which prompted [[W.G. Grace]] to praise "his dashing and fearless hitting", while remarking that he had an awkward style.<ref name="wg"/> In ''Somerset, Cider and Sixes'', David Foot described that he was "possessed of an eagle eye, considerable meat and the ability to make his forcing shots attractive."<ref>Foot (1986), p. 39.</ref> In [[Peter Roebuck]]'s ''From Sammy to Jimmy'', he offered a similar portrait of Hewett's batting style, adding that "he saw it as his task to conquer".<ref name=r49>Roebuck (1991), p. 49.</ref> Hewett's batting received praise in [[Harry Altham|H.S. Altham]] and [[E. W. Swanton]]'s ''A History of Cricket'', where he is described as a "singularly determined and venomous" batsman who "hit the ball in unexpected and demoralizing directions."<ref name="altham"/> He frequently scored his runs rapidly, as described by the Reverend R.S. Holmes, who wrote of his batting against [[Nottinghamshire County Cricket Club|Nottinghamshire]]; "the Captain scored at his usual rate <U+2013> three out of four runs notched, represent his pace. Against Surrey he got 61 out of 81, this time 60 out of the same total. That's the kind of example every captain should set - a run a minute, or thereabouts."<ref>{{cite book |title=Cricket: A Weekly Record of the Game |page=382 |volume=XI |publisher=Merritt & Hatcher |location=London |editor1-last=Alcock |editor1-first=Charles William |date=1892-08-25}}</ref> In summary of the 1892 season ''The Cricket Annual'' notes that "the Somerset player, in fact, had established the reputation of being the most punishing batsman and rapid scorer of the day, and on last season's form no representative eleven could be considered complete without him."<ref>{{cite book |title=The Cricket Annual 1892 |location=London |page=76 |editor1-last=Dewar |editor1-first=William| publisher=Frank Fawcett Driffield, Simpkin Marshall, Hamilton, Kent and Co.}}</ref> Sammy Woods claimed that Hewett disliked fielding, but offered the view that he was good at [[Fielding (cricket)#Fielding position names and locations|point]]. Woods also related how Hewett would chew on a toothpick, which he always had in his mouth when fielding, when his team was losing.<ref>Woods (1925), p. 52.</ref>

As evidenced by the manner in which Hewett left Somerset and walked off during the Scarborough Festival of 1895, he possessed a short fuse. Team-mate [[Frederic John Poynton]] characterised his captain as a player who suffered "from a deep, difficult nature, which once upset, took long to recover".<ref name=r49/> He was a strong leader who was both respected and feared by his colleagues.<ref name=r49/> In 1885, Somerset County Cricket Club had failed to field eleven players for some of their first-class contests, and in most of their other matches were a poor side.<ref name="Foot2328"/> Hewett took on the county captaincy in 1889, and in his second year led his side unbeaten against fellow county opposition to win the 'Second-class County Championship', and gain re-admission to the first-class game. Hewett's batting and captaincy were aided by the emergence of Woods and Palairet, both of whom were named as ''Wisden'' Cricketers of the Year between 1889 and 1893.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/wisdenalmanack/content/story/209422.html |title=Wisden's Five Cricketers of the Year |publisher=ESPNcricinfo |accessdate=2011-02-13}}</ref> In 1891, Somerset finished joint fifth among the nine first-class counties,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cricketarchive.com/Archive/Events/Tables/County_Championship_1891.html |title=County Championship 1891 Table |publisher=CricketArchive |accessdate=2011-02-13}}</ref> while the subsequent year they rose to third.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cricketarchive.com/Archive/Events/Tables/County_Championship_1892.html |title=County Championship 1892 Table |publisher=CricketArchive |accessdate=2011-02-13}}</ref> Hewett's final season at Somerset was the county's least successful under his captaincy, winning just four of their sixteen matches to finish in eighth.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cricketarchive.com/Archive/Events/Tables/County_Championship_1893.html |title=County Championship 1893 Table |publisher=CricketArchive |accessdate=2011-02-13}}</ref>
