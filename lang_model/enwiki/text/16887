The '''[[Fairchild Aircraft]] C-26 "Metroliner"''' is the designation for the [[Fairchild Swearingen Metroliner]] series twin [[turboprop]] aircraft in the service of the [[United States]] military. It was not officially named by the US Armed Forces,<ref>[http://www.dtic.mil/whs/directives/corres/pdf/412015l.pdf DoD 412.15 Military]</ref> but is unofficially known by the same name as its civilian counterpart.<ref>[http://www.fairchild.af.mil/library/mid-aircollisionavoidance/c-26b.asp Fairchild Air Force Base C-26B Metroliner page]</ref> The C-26A is the military version of the Model SA227-AC Metro III; the C-26B is the military version of the Model SA227-BC Metro III and Model SA227-DC Metro 23; and UC-26C is the military designation for the Model SA227-AT Merlin IVC.

==Design and development==

The [[United States Air Force]] bought eleven '''C-26A''' aircraft based on the SA227-AC,<ref>[http://www.uswarplanes.net/commutertypes.html www.uswarplanes.net/commutertypes.html]</ref><ref name="Prod">[http://meltingpot.fortunecity.com/pecan/617/propairliner.html Turboprop Production Lists Home Page] Metro production list accessed via this site 25 August 2007.</ref> two of these being supplied to the [[Venezuelan Air Force]].<ref>Baugher, Joe.

It would appear that the [[USAF]] took delivery of two aircraft serialled 86-0456 and the first (Fairchild c/n AC-745B) was passed to the FAV as 0009, the second being procured to replace that aircraft. The USAF FY1986 Serial Number list has 86-0455 (Fairchild c/n AC-744B) going to the FAV, but the other sources show it was 86-0456/AC-745B.</ref> The first three C-26Bs were procured later in the 1980s, two for the [[United States Army|US Army]] and one for the USAF. These three had been built as SA227-BC models. Later C-26Bs were the military equivalent of the Metro 23 and the USAF took delivery of 37 examples. Some of these were transferred to the [[Peruvian Air Force]] and the US Army, while six were transferred to the [[United States Navy|US Navy]] as '''C-26Ds'''.<ref name="Prod"/><ref>Baugher, Joe.
