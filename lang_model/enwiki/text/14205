The '''PA-20 Pacer''' and '''PA-22 Tri-Pacer''' are a family of four-place, strut braced, high-wing light aircraft that were built by [[The New Piper Aircraft|Piper Aircraft]] in the post-[[World War II]] period.

The Pacer was essentially a four-place version of the two-place [[Piper PA-17 Vagabond|PA-17 Vagabond]] light aircraft. It features a steel tube fuselage and an aluminum frame wing, covered with fabric, much like Piper's most famous aircraft, the [[Piper Cub|Cub]] and [[Piper Super Cub|Super Cub]]. An aircraft prized for its ruggedness, spacious cabin, and, for its time, impressive speed, many Pacers continue to fly today.

Factory installed 125&nbsp;hp (93&nbsp;kW), 135&nbsp;hp (100&nbsp;kW) and 150&nbsp;hp (112&nbsp;kW) engine options were available and 160&nbsp;hp (120&nbsp;kW) as well as 180&nbsp;hp (135&nbsp;kW) engine after-market conversions are an option.

==Development==
The Piper PA-20 Pacer was originally designed as a [[Conventional landing gear|tailwheel]] aircraft and thus had somewhat limited forward visibility on the ground and more demanding ground-handling characteristics. To help introduce more pilots to easier, safer flying, from February 1951, Piper introduced the ''PA-22 Tri-Pacer'' with a [[Tricycle undercarriage|nosewheel]] instead of the tailwheel landing gear.<ref name="jawa51 p281c">Bridgman 1951, p. 281c.</ref> Additionally, the Tri-Pacer offered higher-powered engine options in the form of 150&nbsp;hp (112&nbsp;kW) and 160 HP (120&nbsp;kW) engines, whereas the largest engine available to the original Pacer had an output of 135&nbsp;hp (100&nbsp;kW).<ref name=airliners>

In 1959 and 1960 Piper offered a cheaper, less well-equipped version of the Tri-Pacer with a 150 HP (112&nbsp;kW) [[Lycoming O-320]] designated the ''PA-22-150 Caribbean''.<ref name="Plane and Pilot">Plane and Pilot: ''1978 Aircraft Directory'', pages 60-61. Werner & Werner Corp, Santa Monica CA, 1977. ISBN 0-918312-00-0</ref> Over 8000 Tri-Pacers were produced between 1953 and 1960 when production ended, with over 2000 still registered with the FAA in 2006.

An unusual feature of the Tri-Pacer is the incorporation of [[Bungee cord|bungee]]-linked ailerons and rudder. Beside simplifying the coordination of inflight manoeuvres, this system which can easily be overcome by the pilot as required, allowed the installation of a simplified form of autopilot marketed  by Piper under the name ''Auto-control''.<ref name=flight>

A small number of PA-22s have been converted to [[taildragger]] configuration, resulting in an aircraft that is very similar to a PA-20 Pacer, but which retains the model refinements and features of the PA-22. These conversions are often referred to by owners as ''PA-22/20''s and are often listed in classified aircraft ads as such, although officially such converted aircraft continue to be designated by the [[FAA]] as PA-22 Tri-Pacers. When this conversion is accomplished, a 2 puck disc brake conversion is usually installed in place of the original drum brakes, and the Lycoming O-360 180 HP engine is the preferred upgrade.<ref>Univair Aircraft Corporation, General catalogue, Piper STCs</ref>
Some PA-22s have a Hartzell constant-speed controllable propeller or Koppers Aeromatic propeller.<ref>Piper Parts Manual 752 450 Figure 50 & 51</ref> Each of these installations improves performance/economy at the sacrifice of payload.

A trainer version of the PA-22 Tri-Pacer was designed and designated the ''PA-22-108 Colt''. It was intended to compete directly with other popular trainers of the day, such as the [[Cessna 150]] and was powered by a 108&nbsp;hp (80&nbsp;kW) [[Lycoming O-235]]. Over 2,000 Colts were manufactured during the two production years.<ref name="Plane and Pilot" />

The Colt closely resembles the Tri-Pacer and uses the same landing gear, engine mounts, seats, windshield, door, tail surfaces, struts and the same instrument panel as well.<ref name="Plane and Pilot" /> A few Colts have also been converted to tailwheel configuration, although this is not as popular as converting Tri-Pacers.<ref name=arliner2>

The last batch of 12 PA-22-150s were built for the [[French Army]] in 1963 and the last of the family a PA-22-108 Colt was completed on 26 March 1964. The type was replaced on the Vero Beach production line by the [[Piper Cherokee|PA-28 Cherokee 140]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2012}}

==Operational history==

===Cuba===
Between 1953 and 1955, the [[Cuban Army Air Force]] (Fuerza A<U+00E9>rea Ej<U+00E9>rcito de Cuba, or FAEC) received 7 PA-20s, 4 PA-22-150s, and 3 and PA-22-160s.  During the [[Cuban Revolution]], PA-22s had their rear-doors removed and a .30 caliber machine gun installed in its place for use against insurgents, along with hand-dropped grenades.<ref>{{cite web|title=History of the Cuban Military Aviation|url=http://avstop.com/history/aroundtheworld/cuba/cuba.html|publisher=AVSTOP.COM|accessdate=19 January 2013}}</ref>    A PA-22 providing ground support for the Cuban Army during the Battle of Guisa is believed to be the lone aircraft lost by the FAEC to enemy fire.<ref>{{cite web|last=Dabrowski|first=Krzysztof|title=Air War over Cuba 1956-1959|url=http://www.acig.info/CMS/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=259&Itemid=47|publisher=ACIG.org|accessdate=19 January 2013}}</ref>

===Katanga===
During the [[Congo Crisis]], [[State of Katanga|Katangese]] separatists received five PA-22-150s from the [[South African Air Force]] for the ''Force A<U+00E9>rienne Katangaise''. Deployed against [[ONUC]] forces between 1961 and 1963, their status at the end of the conflict remained somewhat uncertain.<ref name=Katanga>{{cite web|url=http://www.acig.org/artman/publish/article_182.shtml |title=Congo, Part 1; 1960-1963 |publisher=ACIG |year=2003 |accessdate=2013-08-09}}</ref>
