'''Traditional Balsamic Vinegar''' (or '''Aceto Balsamico Tradizionale''') is a designation for aged [[vinegar]]s produced in [[Emilia Romagna]] region ([[Italy]]) starting from cooked [[grape must]]s. In Italy there are two types of balsamic vinegars, i.e. the Traditional Balsamic Vinegar (TBV) and the Balsamic Vinegar of Modena (BVM). TBV has recently received the European [[Protected Designation of Origin]] (PDO) status;<ref>EC Council Regulation No. 813/2000</ref> while, BVM has granted European [[Protected Geographical Indication]] (PGI) status.<ref>EC Council Regulation No. 583/2009</ref> Despite their similar appellation, ''TBV and BVM are very distinct products'' due to different making technologies and starting materials<ref>Giudici, P.; M. Gullo; L. Solieri; P. M. Falcone (2009). Technological and Microbiological Aspects of Taditional Balsamic Vinegar and their influence on Quality and Sensorial Properties. Advances in Food and Nutrition Research, vol. 58.</ref> (see TBV against BVM section). TBV gains its peculiar features during a long aging period that is fixed by law at no less than 12 years.  
As far as the aging method is concerned, it is very similar to the [[Solera]] system used in Spain after Napoleonic Wars spreading abroad after the second half of the 19th century.<ref>Simpson, J. (2003). Spanish Agriculture: The Long Siesta. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, pp. 1765<U+2013>1965</ref>

== Historical note ==
It seems that a deep comprehensive study about the original making procedure, the aging conditions as well as the sensory profile is not available so that the reconstruction of the true history of the TBV is yet a challenge due to the few and often confusing documents.
The first generally accepted document referring to a precious vinegar produced in the area of Modena and Reggio Emilia is the poem written in the 12th century by the monk Donizo of Canossa<ref>Donizo, Acta Comitissae Mathildis (Retrieved from: Donizone, 2008. Vita di Matilde di
Canossa. (Golinelli, P. Ed.). Jaca Book</ref> although the word "balsamic" is never mentioned. The first testimonies clearly speaking about "balsamic vinegar" as well as of recipes and making procedure appear from the 19th century even if little is known about the original recipes and related making practices.<ref>Benedetti, B. (2004). Fatti in casa l<U+2019>aceto balsamico. Manuale illustrato per la formazione conduzione di una acetaia. Il Fiorino, Modena (Italy)</ref> The adjective "balsamic" has been used to designate any kind of generically aromatic vinegar and products not just obtained from the fermentation of grape must alone.<ref>Saccani, F. and Ferrari Amorotti, V. (1999). II balsamico della tradizione secolare. Artestampa, Modena</ref>

== Legal aspects ==
TBV is produced in two different geographical areas of the Emilia Romagna Region so that two different designations were granted by the European Council, i.e. Traditional Balsamic Vinegar of Modena (TBVM) and Traditional Balsamico Vinegar of Reggio Emilia (TBVRE). 
The two special vinegars are very similar products as the overall making procedure is the same; but, under a legal point of view, they are obtained according to specific and official production regulations<ref name=disciplinareTBVM>Disciplinare di produzione, Aceto Balsamico Tradizionale di Modena, MiPAF, May 15, 2000 (G.U. Repubblica Italiana), No.124, May 30, 2000</ref><ref name=disciplinareTBVRE>Disciplinare di produzione, Aceto Balsamico Tradizionale di Reggio Emilia, MiPAF, May 15, 2000 (G.U. Repubblica Italiana), No.124, May 30, 2000</ref> defining (1) the basis of the vineyards ampelographic; (2) geographical area of production; (3) characteristics of starting materials; (4) making procedure; (5) the chemical, physical and sensorial requirements for sale; (6) bottling, labelling and presentation. The sensory profile of TBV is evaluated by hedonic
judgment expressed through a numeric score. The sensory score achieved is used to rank TBV in different commercial classes. The specific regulations allow adding "Extra Vecchio" to the official designation when the product is aged for 25 years at least.  However, under existing regulations, neither the definition of "aging" nor the methods for its objective evaluation are specified; it is evaluated only through panel-tasting tests, whose effectiveness for this purpose is clearly inadequate.<ref>Giudici, P.; Falcone, P. (2009) Sensory Analysis of Traditional Balsamic Vinegar, Industrie delle Bevande, 38: 27-42</ref> TBV results as a blend of vinegars of different composition and age due to the traditional making procedure. Actually, an easy-to-use mathematical method for evaluating the actual residence time of TBV within each cask of the barrel set has been recently published.<ref name=agemodel>Giudici, P. and Rinaldi, G. (2007). A theoretical model to predict the age of traditional balsamic vinegar. J. Food Eng. 82, 121<U+2013>127</ref> This method is an adequate tool helping aging certification. An easy-to-use spreadsheet of the theoretical model is available for download<ref name=spreadsheet>http://www.dipsaa.unimore.it/ita/images/stories/File/downloads/eta_abt.zip</ref> [http://www.dipsaa.unimore.it/ita/images/stories/File/downloads/eta_abt.zip here]. At present, however, independent agencies that officially state TBV authenticity of both the TBVM and TBVRE haven't adopted it or any analogous procedure as a evaluation system.

== Basic Technology ==
Making process of the TBV starts from freshly sqeezed grape juice and finishes with sensorial evaluation of the aged vinegar. Under a technologcal perspective, basic steps are required including cooking of the grape must, alcoholic fermentation by yeasts, acetic oxidation by acetic acid bacteria and slow aging within a barrel set.

===Cooking of the grape must===
Cooking of the grape juice is carried out in open vessels directly heated by fire for 12 <U+2013> 24 hours reducing the volume of about 50%. The production regulations require to start from a grape must with 15<U+00B0>Bx at least to reach at the end of cooking 30<U+00B0>Bx for TBVRE; for TBVM the lower limit is not specified. It is possible to find cooked musts with sugar concentration beyond 50<U+00B0>Bx.<ref name="ReferenceA">.......</ref> The operation allows profound chemical and physical modifications affecting the end quality of TBV. Cooking stops all enzymatic browning reactions that rapidly occur inside fresh grape musts by polyphenol oxidase and progressively promotes grape must discoloration due to the heat-induced deactivation of proteins including browning enzymes. In addition, cooking promotes non-enzymatic browning chemical reactions involving sugar conversion, formation of high molecular weight melanoidins<ref>Falcone, P.M. and Giudici, P. (2008) Molecular Weight and Molecular Weight Distribution impacting Traditional Balsamic Vinegar ageing. Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry; 56(16); 7057-7066</ref> and furanic compounds such as 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF).<ref>Antonelli, A.; Chinnici, F.; Masino, F. (2004) Heat-induced chemical modification of grape must as related to its concentration during the production of traditional balsamic vinegar: a preliminary approach Food Chemistry, 88(1):63-68</ref> Water vaporization induces the concentration of sugars, organic acids, polyphenols, concentration resulting in the increase of density, viscosity, refractive index (Brix degree), and conversely the lowering of water activity, pH value.

===Alcoholic fermentation===
Sugar fermentation and ethanol oxidation occur as a two-step biological transformation of the cooked must. The first requires anaerobic conditions and the second aerobic conditions. The two biological conversions occur inside a dedicated vessel, called the "badessa".
The alcoholic fermentation is carried out by yeasts belonging to a plethora of species and genera.<ref name="ReferenceA"/> In the past there was the idea of a commensalistic interaction between yeasts and acetic acid bacteria but recently the scalar fermentation has been suggested.<ref name="ReferenceA"/>
It is widely accepted that the alcoholic fermentation affects the end quality of TBV due to the several yeasts metabolisms involved.<ref name="ReferenceA"/>

===Acetic bioxidation===
In TBV, the oxidation of ethanol to acetic acid in fermented cooked must is carried out by indigenous acetic acid bacteria naturally occurred in the environment. However, the application of selected acetic acid bacteria strains in TBV production has been recently proposed, and a procedure has been developed for the scale-up of the fermentation process at the vinegar factory scale.<ref>Gullo, M., De Vero, L., and Giudici, P. (2009) Succession of Selected Strains of Acetobacter pasteurianus and other acetic acid bacteria in traditional balsamic vinegar. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 75, 2585<U+2013>2589</ref> Bacteria involved in alcoholic dehydrogenation produce a wide range of compounds other than acetic acid, such as sugar acids and many volatile compounds. So the chemical composition of TBV, relating to the AAB oxidation products, is highly variable and depends on several factors such as the type of grape must, cooking modality, oxidation temperature, and others. The acetification process and the growth of relevant bacteria is mainly affected by the alcohol, sugar and acetic acid content.<ref>Gullo, M. and Giudici, P. (2006). Isolation and selection of acetic acid bacteria strains for traditional balsamic vinegar. Industrie delle Bevande 35, 345<U+2013>350</ref>

===Aging===
The aging is related to two basic concepts.<ref>Giudici, P.; Gullo, M.; Solieri, L.; Falcone, P.M. (2009). Technological and Microbiological Aspects of Taditional Balsamic Vinegar and their influence on Quality and Sensorial Properties. Advances in Food and Nutrition Research, vol. 58</ref> The first concerns the time that vinegar spends inside the barrel set (Age or Residence Time, RT); the second accounts for all time-dependent changes in chemical, physical and sensorial properties (Physical Ripening Time, PRT). 

====<small>The barrel set</small>====
The barrel set is a series of five wooden casks at least that are arranged according to a decreasing size scale, where the product undergoes profound changes over the time. Casks may be of different wood types, i.e. oak, mulberry, ash, chestnut, cherry, juniper, and acacia and the smallest cask volume ranges from 15 to 25 liters. Each cask has an hole on the top, the so-called ''cocchiume'', facilitating the usual inspection and mantainance activities. The barrel set behaves essentially as a device for vinegar concentration due to the water loss through the staves. As widely known for the wine production, it is reasonable to suppose that the wood acts as a semi-permeable filter for the transfer of small molecules towards the ambient while it retains important volatile compounds such as the acetic acid. However, when the opening is not hermetically closed, the volatile compounds are loss preferentially through the cocchiume itself.<ref>Giudici, P.; Solieri, L.; De Vero, L.; Landi, S.; Pulvirenti, A.; Rainieri, S. (2006). Le fermentazioni dell'aceto balsamico tradizionale. Ed. Diabasis, Reggio Emilia (Italy)</ref>

[[Image:Batteria-intera.JPG|thumb|700px|center|A possible configuration of the barrel set]]

====<small>Refilling procedure (Rincalzo)</small>====
[[Image:VPC-refilling.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Refilling and vectorial concentration model in Traditional Balsamic Vinegar production]]
The making procedure of TBV is a semi-continuous process requiring the annual refilling activity, consisting of withdrawing only a part of the vinegar from the smallest cask and topping it with the vinegar coming from the next cask along with the barrel set, and so on. The biggest cask receives new cooked and acetified must. This refilling procedure resembles the Solera method used for making Sherry wine. 
The purpose of refilling in the TBV making is to keep the vinegar volume constant inside every casks in the barrel set, compensate the volume drop caused by the following three factors: TBV withdrawn for bottling, water evaporation, and possible vinegar leakages from the staves.
Refilling procedure involves the product flux-splitting from the biggest to the smallest cask, leading to the solute dislocation along the barrel set.

====<small>Age and Yield</small>====
[[Image:TBV-agelimit.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Refilling and vectorial concentration model in Traditional Balsamic Vinegar production]]
Each cask of a barrel set contains a blend of vinegars with different composition and age due to the refilling procedure. As a consequence, the mean age of vinegar can be calculated as the weighted residence time of the different aliquots of vinegars introduced throughout years. A theoretical model has been recently developed able to estimate the mean age of TBV requiring refilling, withdrawn and casks volumes as input data.<ref name=agemodel /> The refilling procedure imposes a upper limit for the residence time of the vinegar inside the barrel set.
The yield of a barrel set used for TBV production is easy to calculate by the ratio between the amount of TBV withdrawn (mTBV) and the amount of cooked must (mREFILLING) used to refill the biggest cask:
[[Image:barrelset config.png|thumb|250px|left|Configuration and capacity of the barrel set used in the model]][[Image:age vs evap vs withdrawn.png|thumb|250px|left|Residence Time limits obtained for the barrel sample as a function of evaporation and withdrawing]]

<math>Yield=\frac{mTBV}{mREFILLING}</math>

Yield indicates the ability of a barrel set to concentrate cooked must at given operating conditions being dependent on the rate of water loss by evaporation. Low yields are due both to relatively low withdrawn and high water evaporation rates. The latter is the major factor lowering the TBV yield. The bigger is the evaporation rate, the higher is the flux of material through the barrel set and the lower is the residence time.<ref>Lemmetti F., Giudici, P. Gestione della batteria e qualit<U+00E0> dell'aceto balsamico tradizionale. Industrie delle Bevande, 39, agosto, p. 7-16 (2010).</ref><ref>Lemmetti F., Giudici P. L'et<U+00E0> conta. VQ, vite vino e qualit<U+00E0>, 8, 30-36 (2010).</ref> As a consequence, when the yield is low the vinegar age might be relatively low as a function of the amount of cooked must used to refill.<ref>Lemmetti F., Giudici, P. Bilancio di massa ed et<U+00E0> dell'aceto balsamico tradizionale. Industrie delle Bevande, 39, dicembre, p.18-28 (2010).</ref>
Applying the spreadsheet of the theoretical model<ref name=spreadsheet/> to a barrel set as in figure, the residence time obtained as a function of withdrawn quantity and evaporation rate is plotted in the concerning graph.

The composition of TBV is very complex and not yet full described. The classes of the major components are the sugars<ref>Determination of the monosaccharide and alcohol content of balsamic and other vinegars by enzymatic methods Agric. Biol. Chem. Volume 52, 1988. Pages: 25</ref> (mainly glucose and fructose) and organic acids<ref>Cocchi, M., Durante, C., Grandi, M., Lambertini, P., Manzini, D., and Marchetti, A. (2006). Simultaneous determination of sugars and organic acids in aged vinegars and chemometric data analysis. Talanta 69, 1166<U+2013>1175</ref> (mainly acetic, gluconic, malic, tartaric, succinic acids). The classes of the minor compounds refer to volatile compounds<ref>Duran Guerrero, E.; Chinnici, F.; Natali, N.; Natera Marin, R.; Riponi, C. "Development of a solid-phase extraction method applied to the determination of volatile compounds in traditional balsamic vinegar" J. Sep.

Conte, Relationship between the antioxidant properties and the phenolic and flavonoid content in traditional balsamic vinegar, Food Chemistry 105 (2007), pp. 564<U+2013>571</ref> mainly polyphenols.<ref>Plessi, M., Bertelli, D., and Miglietta, F. (2006). Extraction and identification by GC-Ms of phenolic acids in Traditional balsamic vinegar from Modena. J. FoodCompost.Anal. 19, 49<U+2013>54</ref> An important class of minor compounds, recently investigated, is that known as melanoidins, an heterogeneous mixture of polymers arising from sugar degradation reactions activated during cooking of the grape must. These polymers contribute to many physical properties of TBV including colligative ones, the refractive index, density, specific heat capacity melt, and rheological properties.<ref name=MWD>Falcone, P.M.; P. Giudici. (2008). Molecular Weight and Molecular Weight Distribution impacting Traditional Balsamic Vinegar ageing. Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry; 56(16); 7057-7066</ref>

==Physical properties==
The most relevant physical properties of the TBV are:
* pH - usually lower than 3, it is a measure of the extent of carboxylic acids dissociation.
* Density - at 20 <U+00B0>C it cannot be lower than 1.24&nbsp;g/mL (TBVM)<ref name=disciplinareTBVM/> and 1.20&nbsp;g/mL (TBVRE);<ref name=disciplinareTBVRE/> it is a measure of the extent of the solute concentration as well as of water evaporation. 
* Refractive index - it is usually expressed with Brix scale and reach on average 73<U+00B0>Bx 
* Color - It ranges from yellow/brown to brown/black during aging because of the accumulation of compounds, mainly melanoidins, from non-enzymatic reactions such as acidic-catalyzed sugar degradation and Maillard reactions.<ref name=MWD/>
* Viscosity - Its value is on average around 0.56Pa<U+22C5>s<ref name=Rheology>Falcone, P. M., Verzelloni, E., Tagliazucchi, D., and Giudici, P. (2008). A rheological approach to the quantitative assessment of traditional balsamic vinegar quality. J. Food Eng. 86, 433<U+2013>443</ref> and determines the TBV fluency as visually assessed according to procedures in use to assign sensorial judgements.
* Flow index - It indicates the deviation of the flowing properties from the linearity (Newtonian behavior).<ref name=Rheology/>

==TBV against BVM and other balsamic products==
Under a legal point of viiew, TBV is categorized as ''food condiment'', while BVM is a ''wine vinegar''. BVM can be produced without an ageing period; whereas, TBV gains its peculiar features during a long aging period that is fixed by law at no less than 12 years. TBV is the only condiment in the world produced starting from cooked grape musts without the adding of other substances;<ref name=VinegarWorld>Vinegars of the World. L. Solieri and P. Giudici P. Eds. Springer-Verlag Italia S.r.l. (Milan, Italy)</ref> whereas, BVM is nothing but a blend of concentrated grape musts, wine vinegars and [[caramel]].
