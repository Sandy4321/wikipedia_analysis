'''Lambert-St. Louis International Airport''' {{Airport codes|STL|KSTL}} is the primary airport for [[St. Louis, Missouri|St. Louis]], [[Missouri]], [[United States]] and the surrounding area.

The airport lies outside the city limits and is owned and operated by the City of St. Louis. In 2000, 30,558,991 passengers traveled through the airport. Passenger numbers dropped to 13 million in 2004. Passenger numbers grew to over 15.2 million passengers in 2006.<ref name=KSTL_Pax>{{cite web |url = http://www.lambert-stlouis.com/about/facts.htm |title = Historical Passenger Statistics by Type for the Years: 1985-2005 |accessdate = 2007-10-14 |work = General Information about Lambert |publisher = Lambert-St. Louis International Airport |language = English}}</ref> Lambert- St. Louis International Airport serves over 88 non-stop national and international destinations. Lambert is primarily served by aircraft such as the [[Boeing 737]], [[Boeing 757]], [[McDonnell Douglas DC-9]], [[McDonnell Douglas MD-80]], [[Airbus A320]], [[Airbus A319]], and regional jets such as the [[Embraer 145]] and [[Embraer 190]] and also the [[Canadair Regional Jet]]. As of 2007, the largest regularly scheduled aircraft is the [[Boeing 757]] operated by [[American Airlines]]. Connection traffic through Lambert on American Airlines and [[Southwest Airlines]] continues to grow as well.<ref name=KSTL_Pax>{{cite web |url = http://www.lambert-stlouis.com/about/facts.htm |title = Historical Passenger Statistics by Type for the Years: 1985-2005 |accessdate = 2007-10-14 |work = General Information about Lambert |publisher = Lambert-St. Louis International Airport |language = English}}</ref>. Lambert-St. Louis International Airport continues to see increase in passenger traffic. September 2007 showed more growth in the number of boarding passengers with a 4.2 percent increase over September 2006. Year to date, nearly 5.9 million passengers have originated from Lambert, a 1.2 percent over the same 9-month period in 2006. 
American Airlines boarded 190,570 passengers in September. [[Frontier Airlines]] showed the biggest gain in boarding passengers, also called enplanements, among the major national airlines with 12,139 passengers originating from St. Louis in September. That's a 57 percent increase over the same month in 2006. International Charter Airlines service increased 11.2 percent in September. Lambert-St. Louis International Airport serves as a [[airline hub|hub]] for [[American Airlines]] and its regional affiliate, [[AmericanConnection]] and as a [[airline hub|hub]] for [[Great Lakes Airlines]]. It is also home to an American Airlines maintenance ramp and the [[131st Fighter Wing]].

== History ==
[[Image:Lambert-terminal.jpg|thumb|Main terminal]]
[[Image:Lambert-terminal1.jpg|thumb|Control tower and main terminal]]
The airport was originally a [[balloon]] launching base named '''Kinloch Field'''. The [[Wright brothers]] and their [[Wright Exhibition Team|Exhibition Team]] visited the field while touring with their aircraft, and [[Theodore Roosevelt]] flew on one of their aircraft while he was visiting, becoming the first U.S. president to fly.

In 1920, Major [[Albert Bond Lambert]] purchased the field and developed it into an airport with hangars and a terminal.  [[Charles Lindbergh]], whose first pilot job was flying airmail for [[Robertson Airlines]] at the airport, departed the airport for [[New York]] about a week prior to his record-breaking flight to [[Paris]] in 1927. Later that year, Lambert sold the airport, by then known as Lambert Field, to the City of St. Louis. Lambert thus became the first [[Municipality|municipally-owned]] airport in the United States.<ref name="LH">[http://www.lambert-stlouis.com/index/about_History.html Lambert-St. Louis history] retrieved [[2007-12-14]].</ref> 

In the late 1920s Lambert Field became the first airport with an air-traffic control system.  At that time the system consisted of waving flags to communicate with pilots.  The first controller's name was [[Archie League]].<ref name=Centenial_of_Flight>{{cite web | url= http://www.centennialofflight.gov/essay/Evolution_of_Technology/landing_navig/Tech32.htm | title= Aircraft Landing Technology | author= Mola, Roger | publisher= U. S. Centennial of Flight Commission | accessdate=2007-07-24 }}</ref>

Before World War II, Robertson Airlines, [[Marquette Airlines]], and [[Eastern Air Lines]] provided passenger service to St. Louis. During the war, the airport became a manufacturing base for [[McDonnell Aircraft]] and [[Curtiss-Wright]]. After the war, [[Minoru Yamasaki]] was commissioned to design a new passenger terminal at Lambert. Completed in 1956, the four-domed terminal design inspired future terminals at [[John F. Kennedy International Airport]] in [[New York City]] and [[Charles de Gaulle International Airport]] in [[Paris]].<ref name="LH"/>

In the 1970s St. Louis city officials proposed replacing the airport with a new airport in suburban Illinois.  Missouri residents strongly objected and Lambert underwent a $290 million expansion that increased its operational capacity by 50 percent including lengthening of runways and increasing gate capacity to 81.  The proposed [[MidAmerica St. Louis Airport]] ultimately was built in [[Mascoutah, Illinois]] and opened in 1997 and now acts as a [[reliever airport]] to Lambert although it has no major carriers and has been derided as a [[pork barrel]].

[[Trans World Airlines]] (TWA) moved its [[Airline hub|hub]] from [[Kansas City International Airport]] in 1982 and became Lambert's dominant carrier. The St. Louis hub survived TWA's bankruptcy in 1993, and by the late 1990s it was the dominant hub for TWA. After [[American Airlines]] (AA) bought TWA and merged its flight operations in 2001, Lambert became a reliever for AA's existing hubs at [[O'Hare International Airport|Chicago O'Hare]] and [[Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport]].  Since the merger, transatlantic service is no longer available directly from Lambert.  AA transferred many mainline TWA routes to [[American Connection]], a group of affiliated regional carriers. After the 2003 cutbacks, AA introduced American Eagle service at its St. Louis hub in May 2005.  Unlike American Connection, American Eagle is wholly owned by [[AMR Corporation]], the parent company of American Airlines and American Eagle.

American Airlines [http://webpages.charter.net/dandassow/Flight_2470.htm Flight 2470] ([http://flightaware.com/live/flight/AAL2470/history/20060413/1634ZZ/KSNA/KSTL AAL2470]) was the first commercial airliner to land on Runway 11-29, the newest runway at Lambert-St. Louis International Airport. The Lambert-St. Louis International Airport Expansion Program website posted [http://www.lambert-stlouis.com/e/photogallery/default.asp?path=/2006/04/ pictures of the [[April 13]], [[2006]] Runway 11-29 opening ceremonies].

In late December 2006, AA announced that new services would be offered from the St. Louis hub, operated by mainline equipment (i.e. larger American Airlines aircraft) due to an increased demand from business travelers that regional jets could not efficiently sustain.  New routes include [[Austin, Texas|Austin]], [[Boston, Massachusetts|Boston]], [[Raleigh, North Carolina|Raleigh/Durham]], and [[San Antonio, Texas|San Antonio]]. At the end of 2007, Lambert-St. Louis International Airport is American Airlines' fourth-largest hub, behind Dallas-Ft. Worth International Airport, Chicago O'Hare, and [[Miami International Airport]]. [[Southwest Airlines]] also maintains a major presence at Lambert.

In 2006 the [[United States Air Force]] announced plans to relocate the [[131st Fighter Wing]] of the [[Missouri Air National Guard]] and its now 18 [[F-15 Eagle]] aircraft from Lambert-St. Louis International Airport to [[Whiteman Air Force Base]] and other bases in the region starting in 2009. The New Unit will be called the 131st Bomb Wing and will be the only Air Guard Unit to Fly the [[B-2]] Stealth Bomber.

== Expansion - construction==
During the late 1990's Lambert Field was ranked as high as the eighth busiest airport in the USA in terms of operations (not passengers).  This was due to TWA existing as a major hub, Southwest Airlines having significant traffic, and due to a significant amount of commuter traffic to smaller cities in Illinois, Missouri, Arkansas, Iowa and Kentucky.  Whenever weather required the use of instrument landings, the traffic capacity was markedly reduced as for practical purposes only one runway could be used.  This often resulted in large numbers of delays and cancellations at Lambert.  Even in good weather, there could be delays at peak hours, and Lambert briefly redesignated the taxiway immediately north of runway 12L-30R as runway 13-31 and used it for commuter and general aviation traffic.  Runway 11/29 was conceived on this and the basis of traffic projections made in the 1980's and 1990's that warned of impending strains on the airport and the national air traffic system as a result of predicted growth in traffic at the airport.<ref> {{cite web | url=http://www.lambert-stlouis.com/e/newwebsite/id261.asp | title=
The Expansion Story | accessdate=2007-07-25}}</ref> The $1 billion runway expansion was designed in part to allow for simultaneous operations on parallel runways in bad weather. Construction began in 1998, and continued even after traffic at the airport declined following the [[9/11]] attacks, and the purchase of [[Trans World Airlines]] by [[American Airlines]] in April 2001 and subsequent cuts in flights to the airport by American Airlines in 2003.<ref>{{ cite web | url=http://www.lambert-stlouis.com/index/about_Facts_oper_stat.html | title=Historical Operation Statistics by Class for the Years: 1985-2006 | accessdate=2007-07-25}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | url=http://blogs.usatoday.com/sky/2006/04/st_louis.html | title=New $1 billion runway opens this week, but it's not needed anymore | publisher=USAToday.com | date=[[2006-04-11]] | accessdate=2007-07-25}}</ref> The project required the relocation of seven major roads and the destruction of approximately 2,000 homes in [[Bridgeton, Missouri]].<ref>{{ cite web | title=Airport/Mass Transit November 2005 - Feature Story | url=http://midwest.construction.com/2005/11/01/MC_11_01_2005_p27-01.asp | accessdate=2007-07-25}}</ref><ref>{{ cite web | url=http://www.sdearthtimes.com/et0901/et0901s2.html | title=Airports and cities: Can they coexist? | accessdate=2007-07-25}}</ref> In addition to providing superfluous extra capacity for flight operations at the airport, use of the runway is shunned by fuel and time- conscious operations due to its distance from the terminals.<ref>{{cite news | title=St. Louis' airports aren't too loud: They're too quiet | url=http://www.usatoday.com/money/biztravel/2007-01-09-st-louis-usat_x.htm | date=[[2007-01-09]] |publisher=USAToday.com | accessdate=2007-07-25}}</ref>

Airport officials are drafting plans for terminal modernization at this time.  The program, known as the "Airport Experience", is designed to help make the airport more responsive to the needs of passengers.  Working with existing facilities, the program will modernize Lambert's terminals.  In February 2007, Lambert-St. Louis International announced the largest renovation in the airport's history, which will include overhaul just about everything at the Main Terminal, from road signs to window panes.  There will be more stores and restaurants, [[terrazzo]] floors and pedestrian bridges from the parking garage to the ticketing area. A domed glass canopy will arch above sidewalks and roadways, protecting visitors from bad weather.  The $105 million job will be completed in 2012.

== Future service ==

Recently there has been talk about bringing more international passenger flights to Lambert-St. Louis International Airport.  

In addition, plans on international cargo flights from China are now underway.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://stlouis.bizjournals.com/stlouis/stories/2008/02/25/story1.html|title=Paul McKee Jr. lobbies to land Chinese airlines|last=Mueller|first=Angela|date=2008-02-22|publisher=St. Louis Business Journal|accessdate=2008-04-11}}</ref>

[[Air China]] is in talks with [[Missouri]], [[St. Louis]], and Lambert-St. Louis International Airport representatives and politicians to bring a cargo and international passenger hub to STL in 2008.  Representatives from Air China and China will revisit St. Louis in the next months to finalize negotiations.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.news-leader.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20080327/BREAKING03/80327027|title=St. Louis-to-China trade route in works|date=2008-03-27|publisher=[[Springfield News-Leader]]|accessdate=2008-04-11}}</ref><ref>{{cite press release|url=http://www.gov.mo.gov/cgi-bin/coranto/viewnews.cgi?id=EkpyVVuVZZtSTFAJSn&style=Default+News+Style&tmpl=newsitem|title=Gov.
