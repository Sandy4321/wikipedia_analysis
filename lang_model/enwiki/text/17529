'''Jason Donovan''' (born 1 June 1968, [[Malvern, Victoria|Malvern]], Melbourne) is an Australian actor and singer. He initially achieved success in the Australian soap opera ''[[Neighbours]]''. In the UK he has sold more than 3&nbsp;million records, and his d<U+00E9>but album ''[[Ten Good Reasons]]'' was the highest-selling album of 1989 with sales of over 1.5&nbsp;million copies. He has had four UK No. 1 singles, one of which was "[[Especially for You]]", his 1988 duet with [[Kylie Minogue]]. In more recent years, he has returned to acting on television and in stage musicals.

==Biography==
Jason Donovan is the son of actor [[Terence Donovan (actor)|Terence Donovan]], who also appeared in ''[[Neighbours]]'' as [[Doug Willis]], and [[Sue McIntosh]]. His half-sister is former ''Neighbours'' star [[Stephanie McIntosh]]. Donovan attended [[De La Salle College Malvern|De La Salle College, Malvern]]. His girlfriend since 1998 and the mother of his children is Angela Malloch, a former stage manager. He has three children, a daughter, Jemma (born 28 March 2000) a son, Zac (born 22 March 2001), and daughter, Molly (born 9 March 2011). Donovan and Malloch were married in Bali in 2008.<ref name="Daily Mail">{{Cite news |title=Jason Donovan: 'I'd be dead if I wasn't a dad'|work=Daily Mail|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-1090115/Jason-Donovan-Id-dead-I-wasnt-dad.html|date=28 November 2008 |accessdate=27 December 2009 | location=London | first=Richard | last=Barber}}</ref>

He was the subject of an episode of the BBC TV series ''[[Who Do You Think You Are? (British TV series)|Who Do You Think You Are?]]'' on 30 August 2010 in which he discovered he is a descendant of the pioneer [[William Cox (pioneer)|William Cox]], who built the first road across Australia's [[Blue Mountains (Australia)|Blue Mountains]] in 1814. Donovan also confirmed he is of [[History of Jews in England|Jewish]] descent through his maternal great-grandmother, Eileen Dawson (n<U+00E9>e Lyons). His great-great grandparents Joseph & Rosetta Lyons originated from [[Petticoat Lane|Whitechapel]], London.

===''Neighbours''===
Before facing the television cameras, Donovan's image was circulated to a mass audience (within Australia) via a flip-book, sent free to voucher-collecting bubble gum purchasers. This showed Donovan emptying the contents of a watering can over a pink puppet tortoise. 

Donovan made his first television appearance at the age of eleven in a guest role on the Australian series ''[[Skyways (TV series)|Skyways]]''. In the episode, his on-screen sister was played by future co-star [[Kylie Minogue]]. He also featured in the series ''[[I Can Jump Puddles]]'' before reaching fame in 1986 in the soap opera ''[[Neighbours]]'' as [[Scott Robinson (Neighbours)|Scott Robinson]], replacing actor [[Darius Perkins]], who had played the role for the first year of the series. His character's most notable story arc was his [[Scott and Charlene|onscreen romance and wedding]] to Charlene Robinson (played by [[Kylie Minogue]]).

He won his first [[Logie Award]] for "Best New Talent" in 1987 and received a commendation in the category "Performance by a Male Actor In a Series" from the [[Television Society of Australia]]'s [[Penguin Awards]]. In 1988 he was awarded the 'Silver Logie' for the "Most Popular Actor" on Australian television. {{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}

In addition to his regular role in ''Neighbours'', Donovan appeared as "Happy Houston" in the 1988 Australian World War II mini-series ''The Heroes'', based on the historical novel by [[Ronald McKie]]. He won the 1990 [[Logie Award]] for "Most Popular Actor in a Mini-Series".

Donovan left ''Neighbours'' in 1989. In 2009, he announced that he had been asked to return in 2010 to tie in with the show's 25th anniversary, but said that he was unable to do so due to other work commitments.<ref>[http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s14/neighbours/news/a186246/neighbours-asked-jason-donovan-to-return.html]</ref>

===1988<U+2013>1991: Singing sensation===
While he was still appearing in ''Neighbours'', Donovan followed Minogue (who had already left the series by this point) in signing a recording contract with [[Mushroom Records]] in Australia, and with [[PWL]] in the UK. His first single, "Nothing Can Divide Us", was released in 1988. Like Minogue's material, it was written and produced by [[Mike Stock (musician)|Mike Stock]], [[Matt Aitken]] and [[Pete Waterman]] (known as [[Stock Aitken Waterman]]). The single reached number five in the UK, number one in Hong Kong and Japan, and the top 40 in several other countries.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}

Donovan's next single was a duet with Minogue. "[[Especially for You]]" was released in December 1988, and after spending four weeks at No. 2 in the UK, it hit No. 1 in January 1989. It was the fourth-highest selling single in the UK in 1988, and 17th in Australia for 1989. Donovan and Minogue also dated for a time during this period.

His next single, "[[Too Many Broken Hearts]]," reached number one in the UK in March 1989. He released his d<U+00E9>but album, ''[[Ten Good Reasons]]'', in May 1989, which also reached number one (for three weeks). For two weeks, Donovan held the number one positions in the singles chart and the albums chart simultaneously, when his next single, a cover of [[Brian Hyland]]'s "[[Sealed With a Kiss]]", entered the UK charts at number one.

In December 1989 Jason featured on Band Aid II's "[[Do They Know it's Christmas]]".

Between 1988 and 1992, Donovan garnered 16 Top 40 hit singles in the UK.

===1991<U+2013>1993: Joseph and "The Face"===
Donovan continued to act alongside his pop career, and in 1990 he appeared in his first feature film ''[[Blood Oath (film)|Blood Oath]]'' (aka ''Prisoners of the Sun'').

With questions about his ability to sing, and the break-up of his relationship with Minogue due to her relationship with INXS singer [[Michael Hutchence]], in 1991 Donovan accepted the lead role in the restaged [[London Palladium]] version of ''[[Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat]]'', directed by [[Steven Pimlott]]. Donovan had his third solo UK #1 single with one of its tracks, ''[[Any Dream Will Do (song)|Any Dream Will Do]],'' while the production won the 1992 [[Laurence Olivier Awards]] for set design and costume design. However, Donovan later left the production citing "exhaustion" as the reason, and he was replaced in 1993 by TV presenter [[Phillip Schofield]].

In 1992, Donovan launched a successful [[libel]] action against ''[[The Face (magazine)|The Face]]'' magazine which had published allegations that he was gay. Donovan won <U+00A3>200,000 in damages and the magazine had to pay a further <U+00A3>100,000 in costs,<ref name="bubble">{{Cite web |title=Jason Donovan: Is the actor turned pop star still "Neighbours" with Kylie? |work=thebubbleburst.co.uk |url=http://www.thebubbleburst.co.uk/bb.php?entry=Jason%20Donovan |accessdate=30 July 2007}}</ref> but the action of his lawsuit made him appear homophobic to some sections of the media and had the effect of alienating much of his audience. Donovan tried to make amends and claimed that he did not sue the magazine out of greed or because he was homophobic, but because he had been accused of lying to his fans. He also came to an agreement with the publishers of the magazine, which would have closed down had they paid him the full amount he was awarded (though this amount could well have been reduced upon appeal anyway). Regardless, Donovan's career never recovered from his act of litigation. Although he had been a mild drug user who had smoked [[joint (cannabis)|cannabis joints]] up until this point, in the months after his libel action Donovan began using cocaine.<ref name="Donovan autobiog">Donovan, Jason <U+2013> "Between The Lines: My Story Uncut" (2007) HarperCollins Publishing (ISBN 978-0007261475)</ref> In a 2007 interview in the magazine "Marie Claire" and also in his 2007 autobiography "Between The Lines: My Story Uncut", Donovan admitted that suing [[The Face (magazine)|The Face]] was the biggest mistake of his life.<ref name="Donovan autobiog"/>

Now no longer signed to PWL, who had released his first two albums and a "greatest hits" compilation, Donovan moved to [[Polydor Records]]. The year after his libel action against "The Face", he released his third album, ''All Around The World'' (1993). However, the album was not a success and failed to make the UK Top 20 (all of Donovan's albums up until then had been Top 10) and was not released at all in his native Australia. Donovan was subsequently dropped by his new record company, effectively marking the end of his career as a pop star.

===1995<U+2013>1999: Drugs===
Donovan later admitted that by 1995 he had a serious drug problem, taking around two grams of cocaine a day. In early 1995, he attended model [[Kate Moss]]'s 21st birthday party at [[The Viper Room]] in Los Angeles, where he suffered a drug-induced seizure (the same venue at which [[River Phoenix]] had died of a drug overdose in 1993). Donovan was rushed to hospital and claims that the last face he remembered seeing was that of [[Michael Hutchence]].<ref name="Daily Mail"/>

Later in 1995, Donovan starred in the natively produced Australian film called ''The Last Bullet''<ref>[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0113606/ The Last Bullet (1995) (TV)<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> with [[Koji Tamaki]], directed by Michael Pattison, which was set in World War II on the Pacific island of [[Borneo]] in the last days of 1945.

In 1998, Donovan took the lead role of [[Dr. Frank N. Furter]] in the UK touring production of ''[[Rocky Horror Show|The Rocky Horror Show]],'' where he met stage manager Angela Malloch. After the pair had a brief relationship, Malloch became pregnant and gave Donovan an ultimatum that he had to kick drugs once and for all if he wanted to be part of their child's life.<ref name="Daily Mail"/>

In various articles in late 1999, Donovan admitted that he still used cocaine, saying: ''I still have a joint and I still take coke, but not as much as I did two years ago.''<ref>{{Cite news|title=Donovan admits drugs habit|publisher=BBC News |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/281941.stm|date=18 February 1999 |accessdate=29 July 2007}}</ref>

Donovan has claimed to be drug-free since 2000, the year his first child was born.<ref name="Daily Mail"/>

===2000<U+2013>2005: Fatherhood===
Donovan's daughter Jemma was born in March 2000. Since then, with his drug problems now under control, he continued to act on stage and television, and had a  role in the medical-legal television drama ''[[MDA (TV series)|MDA]]'' (2003<U+2013>05), on Australia's [[ABC Television|ABC network]]. Since 2003, Donovan has also lent his voice to the ''[[Buzz!]]'' series of quiz video games.

In late 2004, he was headlining in the stage musical ''[[Chitty Chitty Bang Bang (musical)|Chitty Chitty Bang Bang]]'' at the [[London Palladium]]. He finished his original run on 13 March 2005, but was then invited back from June onwards to play in the final two months of the show, until its closure on 4 September 2005. Following this, he has toured the UK performing a few gigs and returned to the stage in January 2006 to star in a UK tour of [[Stephen Sondheim]]'s ''[[Sweeney Todd (musical)|Sweeney Todd]]''. After this, he returned to Melbourne to star in David Eldrige's Australian transfer of the London drama ''Festen''.

===2005: Virgin Mobile viral marketing===
In 2005, Donovan's mobile phone number was circulated around the web in Australia, due to an image that was taken in Sydney. It appeared that Donovan was trying to sell his car, and unwittingly released his mobile phone number to the public. From 10 September, his answering machine had a special message on it, because he was frustrated by the number of calls he was receiving for no particular reason. [[Virgin Group|Virgin]] placed advertisements in several high-profile Australian newspapers, urging people not to call Donovan, one of their customers.<ref>[http://members.iinet.net.au/~bfarquhar/pics/Jason%20Donovan1.jpg]</ref> Virgin Mobile has since admitted the photos were all part of a marketing ploy. Virgin also ran TV advertisements showing Donovan answering prank calls, asking the viewer not to call him, then displaying his number.

===2006: I'm a Celebrity... Get Me Out of Here!===
Donovan took part in ''[[I'm a Celebrity... Get Me Out of Here!]]'' in 2006 and finished in 3rd place. While in the jungle, he became good friends with [[David Gest]] and [[Matt Willis]]. Donovan also took part in many Bushtucker Trials, which included wearing a helmet full of insects and playing a giant game of [[Operation (game)|Operation]]. Donovan lost out on the King of the Jungle Crown to Matt Willis. However, during an interview on "The Steve Wright Show" on BBC Radio 2 (January 2008), he claimed that his appearance on ''I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here!'' had revitalised his career.

===2007<U+2013>2009: Return to soap operas and singing===
[[Image:Jason Donvan signing.jpg|thumb|right|Jason Donovan at a 2007 book signing in [[Waterstones]] [[Bournemouth]].]]
Donovan performed a medley of songs from ''Joseph'' along with other actors who have played the eponymous role ([[Donny Osmond]] and [[Lee Mead]]) at the [[Concert for Diana]] in July 2007.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Andrew Lloyd Webber medley, featuring: |work=concertfordiana.com |url=http://www.concertfordiana.com/performers/alw.asp |accessdate=29 July 2007}}</ref>

In early 2008, Donovan had a role in ITV's post-watershed soap opera ''[[Echo Beach (soap)|Echo Beach]]''; the series was cancelled after 12 episodes. He also presented ''Sunday Night with Jason Donovan'', a programme on [[The One Network]] of British local radio stations.

On 25 September 2008, Donovan performed in the canteen at the head offices of [[Tesco]] in [[Welwyn Garden City]], Hertfordshire. He was promoting his forthcoming album, ''Let It Be Me'', which was released on 10 November 2008. The album, his first for 15 years, reached No. 28 in [[UK|Britain]].

Also in 2008, Donovon performed at the Party In The Park in [[Wellingborough]], Northamptonshire.

In 2009, Donovan performed as Tick (Mitzi) in the London stage musical production of ''[[Priscilla Queen of the Desert (musical)|Priscilla Queen of the Desert]]'' at the [[Palace Theatre, London|Palace Theatre]]. Also in 2009, Donovan began appearing in television commercials (with [[Kerry Katona]] and [[Coleen Nolan]]) for the frozen food supermarket chain [[Iceland (supermarket)|Iceland]] in the UK.

===2010 <U+2013> Onwards: TV Work, 80s Album & War Of The Worlds===
In September 2010, Donovan took part in the BBC Television Series ''[[Who Do You Think You Are? (British TV series)|Who Do You Think You Are?]]'', tracing his family tree back several generations. Donovan's fifth studio album, ''[[Soundtrack of the 80s|Soundtrack Of The 80s]]'', was released in October 2010. The album is composed of cover versions of well known 80s hits such as "[[Drive (The Cars song)|Drive]]" ([[The Cars]]), "[[I Just Died In Your Arms]]" ([[Cutting Crew]]) and "[[Sign Your Name]]" ([[Terence Trent D'Arby]]) and several others. Donovan was recently announced to be playing the role of The Artilleryman in the 2010<U+2013>2011 stage show ''[[Jeff Wayne's Musical Version of The War of the Worlds]]''. The show will tour the UK and Europe, starting in November 2010 and finishing in Germany in January 2011.{{citation needed|date=February 2011}} In 2010, Donovan voiced the part of Toby the Kangaroo in the environmental animated film, ''[[Animals United (film)|Animals United]]''. Donovan has appeared in ''[[Casualty (TV series)|Casualty]]'' as a British soldier injured in Afghanistan. In 2011 he is touring with the "Sound of the Music" playing Captain Von Trapp co-starring Verity Rushworth as Maria.
