The '''Messerschmitt Me 334''' was a [[German]] projected piston-engined [[Fighter aircraft|fighter]], designed by [[Alexander Lippisch]].<ref name=Meyer>{{cite book|last1=Meyer|first1=Walter Schick ; Ingolf|title=Geheimprojekte der Luftwaffe : Jagdflugzeuge 1939-1945|date=1994|publisher=Motorbuch-Verl.|location=Stuttgart|isbn=978-3613016316|edition=1. Aufl.|language=German}}</ref>

==Design and development==
Aleksander Lippisch was noted for designing tail-less aircraft with a certain amount of success. Along similar lines to the rocket-powered [[Me 163]] Lippisch designed a tail-less fighter to be powered by a Heinkel turbojet. The slow pace of development of reliable turbojets forced lippisch to re-design the aircraft to be powered by a single [[Daimler-Benz DB 605]] inverted V-12 piston engine, mounted in the nose and driving a pusher propeller at the rear of the fuselage pod via an extension shaft.<ref name=Meyer/>

The mid-mounted wings would have been swept back at 23.4<U+00B0>, housing the stalky retractable main landing gear with elevons inboard and ailerons outboard on the trailing edge. Slots in the outboard leading edges would have improved slow speed performace and handling.<ref name=Meyer/>

The intended armament of two {{convert|13|mm|in|abbr=on|3}} [[MG 131]] machine guns was to have been housed in the wing-roots. Designated Me 334 by the ''[[Reichsluftfahrtministerium]]'' (RLM), development was abandoned by Lippisch with the advent of the [[Lippisch P.20]].<ref name=Meyer/>
