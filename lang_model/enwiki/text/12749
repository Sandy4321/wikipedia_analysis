{{Buddhism}}
The '''History of Buddhism''' spans the 6th century BCE to the present, starting with the birth of Buddha [[Gautama Buddha|Siddhartha Gautama]] on the [[Indian subcontinent]], in what is now [[Lumbini]], [[Nepal]]. This makes it one of the oldest religions practiced today. The religion evolved as it spread from the northeastern region of the Indian subcontinent through [[Central Asia|Central]], [[East Asia|East]], and [[Southeast Asia]]. At one time or another, it influenced most of the Asian continent. The history of Buddhism is also characterized by the development of numerous movements, schisms, and schools, among them the [[Theravada|Therav<U+0101>da]], [[Mahayana|Mah<U+0101>y<U+0101>na]] and [[Vajrayana|Vajray<U+0101>na]] traditions, with contrasting periods of expansion and retreat.

[[Siddh<U+0101>rtha Gautama]] was the historical founder of [[Buddhism]]. He was born a [[Kshatriya]] warrior  prince in what is now Lumbini, Nepal, in 623 BCE.<ref name=UNESCO>UNESCO World Heritage Site (http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/666)</ref>  His particular family of Sakya Kshatriyas were of [[Brahmin]] lineage (Sanskrit: ''[[gotra]]''), as indicated by the family name "Gautama". 19th-century scholars, such as Dr. Eitel, connected it to the Brahmin Rishi Gautama.<ref>P. 95 ''A Record of Buddhistic Kingdoms'' By James Legge</ref> In many Buddhist texts, Buddha is said to be a descendant of the Brahmin [[Angiras (sage)|Sage Angirasa]].<ref>''The Life of Buddha as Legend and History'', by [[Edward Joseph Thomas]], first published in 1927</ref> For example, "''In the P<U+0101>li Mahavagga "Angirasa" (in P<U+0101>li Angirasa) occurs as a name of Buddha Gautama who evidently belonged to the Angirasa tribe...''".<ref>P. 19 ''A history of Indian logic'' By Satis Chandra Vidyabhusana</ref> Scholar [[Edward J. Thomas]] too connected Buddha with sages Gautama and Angirasa.<ref>P. 22 ''The Life of Buddha'' By Edward J. Thomas</ref>

After asceticism and [[meditation]], Siddhartha Gautama discovered the Buddhist [[Middle Way]]<U+2014>a path of moderation away from the extremes of self-indulgence and [[asceticism|self-mortification]].

Siddhartha Gautama attained enlightenment sitting under a [[pipal]] tree, now known as the [[Bodhi tree]] in [[Bodh Gaya]], [[India]]. Gautama, from then on, was known as ''"The Enlightened One ,"'' the [[Three types of Buddha|Samyaksambuddha]].

Buddha found patronage in the ruler of [[Magadha]], emperor [[Bimbisara|Bimbis<U+0101>ra]]. The emperor accepted  Buddhism as his personal faith and allowed the establishment of many Buddhist ''[[Vihara|vih<U+0101>ras]]''. This eventually led to the renaming of the entire region as [[Bihar|Bih<U+0101>r]].<ref name=Wolpert>India by [[Stanley Wolpert]] (Page 32)</ref>

At the Deer Park near [[Varanasi|{{IAST|V<U+0101>r<U+0101><U+1E47>as<U+012B>}}]] in [[northern India]], Buddha set in motion [[Dharmacakra|Wheel of Dharma]] by delivering his first sermon to a group of five companions with whom he had previously sought enlightenment. Together with the Buddha they formed the first [[Sangha|{{IAST|Sa<U+1E45>gha}}]], the company of Buddhist monks, and hence, the first formation of the [[Triple Gem]] (Buddha, [[Dharma]] and Sa<U+1E45>gha) was completed.

For the remaining years of his life, the Buddha is said to have traveled in the [[Gangetic Plain]] of Northeastern [[India]] and other regions.

Buddha attained ''[[Parinirvana|parinirv<U+0101><U+1E47>a]]'' in the abandoned jungles of [[Kushinagar|Ku<U+015B>in<U+0101>ra]].

Just before Buddha died, he reportedly told his followers that thereafter the Dharma (doctrine, teaching) would be their leader.  The early arhants considered Gautama's words the primary source of Dharma and Vinaya (rules of discipline and community living), and took great pains to formulate and transmit his teachings accurately.  Nonetheless, no ungarnished collection of his sayings has survived.  The versions of the canon (accepted scripture) preserved in [[P<U+0101>li Canon|P<U+0101>li]], Sanskrit, [[Chinese Buddhist canon|Chinese]], and [[Tibetan Buddhist canon|Tibetan]] are sectarian variants of a corpus that grew and crystallized during three centuries of oral transmission.<ref>Robinson, Richard and Johnson, Willard (1977).

==Early Buddhism==
{{Further|History of Buddhism in India}}
Early Buddhism remained centered around the Ganges valley, spreading gradually from its ancient heartland. The canonical sources record two councils, where the monastic Sangha established the textual collections based on the Buddha's teachings and settled certain disciplinary problems within the community.

===1st Buddhist council (5th c. BCE)===
{{Main|First Buddhist Council}}
The first Buddhist council was held just after Buddha's [[Parinirvana]], and presided over by Gupta [[Mah<U+0101>k<U+0101><U+015B>yapa]], one of His most senior disciples, at R<U+0101>jag<U+1E5B>ha (today's [[Rajgir]]) during the 5th century under the noble support of king Aj<U+0101>tha<U+015B>atru. The objective of the council was to record all of Buddha's teachings into the doctrinal teachings ([[sutra]]) and [[Abhidhamma]] and to codify the monastic rules ([[vinaya]]). [[Ananda|<U+0100>nanda]], one of the Buddha's main disciples and his cousin, was called upon to recite the discourses and Abhidhamma of the Buddha, and Upali, another disciple, recited the rules of the [[vinaya]]. These became the basis of the [[Tripi<U+1E6D>aka]] (Three Baskets), which is preserved only in [[P<U+0101>li]].

===2nd Buddhist council (4th c. BCE)===
{{Main|The Second Buddhist Council}}
The second Buddhist council was held at Vaisali following a dispute that had arisen in the Sa<U+1E45>gha over a relaxation by some monks of various points of discipline. Eventually it was decided to hold a second council at which the original Vinaya texts that had been preserved at the first Council were cited to show that these relaxations went against the recorded teachings of the Buddha.

==A<U+015B>okan proselytism (c. 261 BCE)==
{{Further|Ashoka the Great|Maurya Empire}}
{{See also|Edicts of Ashoka|Ashokavadana}}
[[File:Maurya Dynasty in 265 BCE.jpg|thumb|The [[Maurya Empire]] under [[Ashoka|Emperor A<U+015B>oka]] was the world's first major Buddhist state.  It established free hospitals and free education and promoted human rights.]]
[[File:6thPillarOfAshoka.JPG|thumb|Fragment of the 6th Pillar [[Edicts of Ashoka|Edict of A<U+015B>oka]] (238 BCE), in [[Br<U+0101>hm<U+012B> script|Br<U+0101>hm<U+012B>]], sandstone. [[British Museum]].]][[File:Sanchi2.jpg|thumb|Great Stupa (3rd century BCE), [[Sanchi]], India.]]
The [[Maurya Empire|Mauryan]] Emperor [[Ashoka|A<U+015B>oka]] (273&ndash;232 BCE) converted to Buddhism after his bloody conquest of the territory of [[Kalinga (India)|Kalinga]] (modern [[Orissa]]) in [[East India|eastern India]] during the [[Kalinga War]]. Regretting the horrors and misery brought about by the conflict, the king magnanimously decided to renounce violence, to replace the misery caused by war with respect and dignity for all humanity. He propagated the faith by building [[stupa]]s and pillars urging, amongst other things, respect of all animal life and enjoining people to follow the [[Dharma]]. Perhaps the finest example of these is the Great Stupa in Sanchi, India (near Bhopal). It was constructed in the 3rd century BCE and later enlarged. Its carved gates, called ''[[torana]]s'', are considered among the finest examples of Buddhist art in India. He also built roads, hospitals, resthouses, universities and [[irrigation]] systems around the country. He treated his subjects as equals regardless of their religion, politics or [[caste]].

This period marks the first spread of Buddhism beyond India to other countries. According to the plates and pillars left by A<U+015B>oka (the [[Edicts of Ashoka|edicts of A<U+015B>oka]]), emissaries were sent to various countries in order to spread Buddhism, as far south as [[Sri Lanka]] and as far west as the Greek kingdoms, in particular the neighboring [[Greco-Bactrian Kingdom]], and possibly even farther to the Mediterranean.

===3rd Buddhist council (c.250 BCE)===
{{Main|Third Buddhist Council}}
King [[Ashoka|A<U+015B>oka]] convened the third Buddhist council around 250 BCE at Pataliputra (today's [[Patna, India|Patna]]). It was held by the monk [[Moggaliputtatissa]]. The objective of the council was to purify the Sa<U+1E45>gha, particularly from non-Buddhist ascetics who had been attracted by the royal patronage. Following the council, Buddhist missionaries were dispatched throughout the known world.

===Hellenistic world===
Some of the [[Edicts of Ashoka|edicts of A<U+015B>oka]] describe the efforts made by him to propagate the Buddhist faith throughout the Hellenistic world, which at that time formed an uninterrupted continuum from the borders of India to Greece. The edicts indicate a clear understanding of the political organization in Hellenistic territories: the names and locations of the main Greek monarchs of the time are identified, and they are claimed as recipients of Buddhist [[proselytism]]: [[Antiochus II Theos]] of the [[Seleucid Kingdom]] (261&ndash;246 BCE),  [[Ptolemy II of Egypt|Ptolemy II Philadelphos]] of Egypt (285&ndash;247 BCE), [[Antigonus Gonatas]] of Macedonia (276&ndash;239 BCE), [[Magas of Cyrene|Magas]] (288&ndash;258 BCE) in [[Cyrenaica]] (modern [[Libya]]), and [[Alexander II of Epirus|Alexander II]] (272&ndash;255 BCE) in [[Epirus]] (modern Northwestern [[Greece]]).
[[File:Asoka Kaart.gif|thumb|Buddhist [[proselytism]] at the time of Emperor [[Ashoka|A<U+015B>oka]] (260&ndash;218 BCE), according to the [[Edicts of Ashoka|edicts of A<U+015B>oka]].]]

:"The conquest by [[Dharma]] has been won here, on the borders, and even six hundred [[yojana]]s (5,400<U+2013>9,600 km) away, where the Greek king Antiochos rules, beyond there where the four kings named Ptolemy, Antigonos, Magas and Alexander rule, likewise in the south among the [[Chola]]s, the [[Pandya]]s, and as far as [[Tamraparni]] ([[Sri Lanka]])." ([[Edicts of Ashoka|Edicts of A<U+015B>oka]], 13th Rock Edict, S. Dhammika).

Furthermore, according to [[P<U+0101>li]] sources, some of A<U+015B>oka's emissaries were Greek Buddhist monks, indicating close religious exchanges between the two cultures:

:"When the thera (elder) Moggaliputta, the illuminator of the religion of the Conqueror (A<U+015B>oka), had brought the (third) council to an end (...) he sent forth theras, one here and one there: (...) and to Aparantaka (the "Western countries" corresponding to [[Gujarat]] and [[Sindh]]) he sent the Greek ([[Yona]]) named [[Dharmaraksita|Dhammarakkhita]]". ([[Mahavamsa]] XII).

[[File:AsokaKandahar.jpg|thumb|Bilingual inscription ([[Greek language|Greek]] and [[Aramaic]]) by Emperor [[Ashoka|A<U+015B>oka]], from [[Kandahar]]. [[Kabul]] Museum (click image for full translation).]]
A<U+015B>oka also issued edicts in the Greek language as well as in Aramaic. One of them, found in Kandahar, advocates the adoption of "piety" (using the Greek term ''[[eusebeia]]'' for [[Dharma]]) to the Greek community:

:"Ten years (of reign) having been completed, King Piodasses (A<U+015B>oka) made known (the doctrine of) piety (Greek:''<U+03B5><U+1F50><U+03C3><U+03AD><U+03B2><U+03B5><U+03B9><U+03B1>'', [[eusebeia]]) to men; and from this moment he has made men more pious, and everything thrives throughout the whole world."
:(Trans. from the Greek original by G.P. Carratelli<ref>''History of Afghanistan'': http://www.afghanan.net/afghanistan/mauryans.htm</ref>)

It is not clear how much these interactions may have been influential, but some authors have commented that some level of [[syncretism]] between Hellenist thought and Buddhism may have started in Hellenic lands at that time. They have pointed to the presence of Buddhist communities in the Hellenistic world around that period, in particular in [[Alexandria]] (mentioned by [[Clement of Alexandria]]), and to the pre-Christian monastic order of the [[Therapeutae]] (possibly a deformation of the P<U+0101>li word "[[Theravada|Therav<U+0101>da]]"<ref>According to the linguist Zacharias P. Thundy</ref>), who may have "almost entirely drawn (its) inspiration from the teaching and practices of Buddhist asceticism"<ref>"Zen living", [[Robert Linssen]]</ref> and may even have been descendants of A<U+015B>oka's emissaries to the West.<ref>"The Original Jesus" (Element Books, Shaftesbury, 1995), Elmar R Gruber, Holger Kersten</ref> The philosopher [[Hegesias of Cyrene]], from the city of [[Cyrene, Libya|Cyrene]] where [[Magas of Cyrene]] ruled, is sometimes thought to have been influenced by the teachings of A<U+015B>oka's Buddhist missionaries.<ref>"The philosopher Hegesias of Cyrene (nicknamed ''Peisithanatos'', "The advocate of death") was a contemporary of Magas and was probably influenced by the teachings of the Buddhist missionaries to Cyrene and Alexandria. His influence was such that he was ultimately prohibited from teaching." Jean-Marie Lafont, [[Inalco]] in "Les Dossiers d'Arch<U+00E9>ologie", No254, p.78</ref>

Buddhist gravestones from the [[Ptolemaic period]] have also been found in Alexandria, decorated with depictions of the Dharma wheel.<ref>Tarn, ''The Greeks in Bactria and India''</ref> The presence of Buddhists in Alexandria has even drawn the conclusion: "It was later in this very place that some of the most active centers of Christianity were established".<ref>[[Robert Linssen]], ''Zen living''</ref>

In the 2nd century CE, the Christian dogmatist, [[Clement of Alexandria]] recognized Bactrian Buddhists (''[[Sramana|<U+015B>ramanas]]'') and Indian ''[[gymnosophist]]s'' for their influence on Greek thought:

:"Thus philosophy, a thing of the highest utility, flourished in antiquity among the barbarians, shedding its light over the nations. And afterwards it came to [[Greece]]. First in its ranks were the prophets of the [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptians]]; and the [[Chaldea]]ns among the [[Assyrian people|Assyrians]]; and the [[Druids]] among the [[Gauls]]; and the ''[[Sramana|<U+015B>ramanas]]'' among the [[Bactrians]] ("<U+03A3><U+03B1><U+03C1><U+03BC><U+03B1><U+03BD><U+03B1><U+03AF><U+03BF><U+03B9> <U+0392><U+03AC><U+03BA><U+03C4><U+03C1><U+03C9><U+03BD>"); and the philosophers of the [[Celts]]; and the [[Magi]] of the [[Persian people|Persians]], who foretold the Saviour's birth, and came into the land of [[Judea]] guided by a star. The Indian gymnosophists are also in the number, and the other barbarian philosophers. And of these there are two classes, some of them called ''[[Sramana|<U+015B>ramanas]]'' ("<U+03A3><U+03B1><U+03C1><U+03BC><U+03AC><U+03BD><U+03B1><U+03B9>"), and others ''[[Brahmins]]'' ("<U+0392><U+03C1><U+03B1><U+03C6><U+03BC><U+03B1><U+03BD><U+03B1><U+03B9>")."

===Expansion to Sri Lanka and Burma===
{{Further|Buddhism in Sri Lanka|Buddhism in Burma}}
[[Sri Lanka]] was proselytized by A<U+015B>oka's son [[Mahinda]] and six companions during the 2nd century BCE. They converted the king Devanampiya Tissa and many of the nobility.  In addition, A<U+015B>oka's daughter, Sa<U+1E45>ghamitta also established the bhikkhun<U+012B> (order for nuns) in Sri Lanka, also bringing with her a sapling of the sacred bodhi tree that was subsequently planted in Anuradhapura. This is when the [[Mahavihara|Mah<U+0101>vih<U+0101>ra]] monastery, a center of Sinhalese orthodoxy, was built.  The [[Pali Canon|P<U+0101>li canon]] was written down in Sri Lanka during the reign of king Vattagamani (29&ndash;17 BCE), and the Therav<U+0101>da tradition flourished there. Later some great commentators worked there, such as [[Buddhaghosa|Buddhagho<U+1E63>a]] (4th&ndash;5th century) and Dhammap<U+0101>la (5th&ndash;6th century), and they systemised the traditional commentaries that had been handed down. Although Mah<U+0101>y<U+0101>na Buddhism gained some influence in Sri Lanka at that time, the Therav<U+0101>da ultimately prevailed and Sri Lanka turned out to be the last stronghold of it. From there it would expand again to South-East Asia from the 11th century.

In the areas east of the Indian subcontinent (modern [[Burma]] and [[Thailand]]), Indian culture strongly influenced the [[Mon (ethnic group)|Mons]].  The Mons are said to have been converted to Buddhism from the 3rd century BCE under the proselytizing of the Indian Emperor [[Ashoka|A<U+015B>oka]], before the fission between Mah<U+0101>y<U+0101>na and [[Hinayana|Hinay<U+0101>na]] Buddhism. Early Mon{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} Buddhist temples, such as Peikthano in central Burma, have been dated to between the 1st and the 5th century CE.
[[File:MonWheel.jpg|thumb|[[Mon (ethnic group)|Mons]] Wheel of the Law ([[Dharmachakra]]), art of [[Dvaravati]], c.8th century.]]

The [[Buddhist art]] of the Mons was especially influenced by the Indian art of the [[Gupta Empire|Gupta]] and post-Gupta periods, and their mannerist style spread widely in South-East Asia following the expansion of the Mon kingdom between the 5th and 8th centuries.  The Therav<U+0101>da faith expanded in the northern parts of Southeast Asia under Mon influence, until it was progressively displaced by Mah<U+0101>y<U+0101>na Buddhism from around the 6th century CE.

According to the ''[[Ashokavadana|A<U+015B>ok<U+0101>vad<U+0101>na]]'' (2nd century CE), A<U+015B>oka sent a missionary to the north, through the Himalayas, to [[Khotan]] in the [[Tarim Basin]], then the land of the [[Tocharians]], speakers of an [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European language]].

==Rise of the Sunga (2nd&ndash;1st century BCE)==
{{Further|Sunga Empire}}
{{See also|Pusyamitra Sunga|Decline of Buddhism in India}}
The [[Sunga dynasty]] (185&ndash;73 BCE) was established in 185 BCE, about 50 years after A<U+015B>oka's death. After assassinating King [[Brhadrata]] (last of the [[Mauryan]] rulers), military commander-in-chief [[Pusyamitra Sunga]] took the throne. Buddhist religious scriptures such as the [[Ashokavadana|A<U+015B>ok<U+0101>vad<U+0101>na]] allege that Pusyamitra (an orthodox [[Brahmin]]) was hostile towards Buddhists and persecuted the Buddhist faith. Buddhists wrote that he "destroyed hundreds of monasteries and killed hundreds of thousands of innocent Monks":<ref>[[Divyavadana|Divy<U+0101>vad<U+0101>na]], pp. 429&ndash;434</ref> 840,000 Buddhist [[stupa]]s which had been built by A<U+015B>oka were destroyed, and 100 gold coins were offered for the head of each Buddhist monk.<ref>Indian Historical Quarterly Vol. XXII, p. 81 ff cited in Hars.407</ref> In addition, Buddhist sources allege that a large number of Buddhist monasteries (''vih<U+0101>ras'') were converted to [[Hindu]] temples, in places like, but not limited to, [[Nalanda]], [[Bodhgaya]], [[Sarnath]], and [[Mathura, Uttar Pradesh|Mathura]], among many others.

Modern historians, however, dispute this view in the light of literary and archaeological evidence. They opine that following A<U+015B>oka's sponsorship of Buddhism, it is possible that Buddhist institutions fell on harder times under the Sungas, but no evidence of active persecution has been noted. [[Etienne Lamotte]] observes: ''"To judge from the documents, Pushyamitra must be acquitted through lack of proof."''<ref>Elst, Koneraad. ''Ashoka and Pushyamitra, iconoclasts?'': http://koenraadelst.voiceofdharma.com/books/acat/ch2.htm#5a</ref> Another eminent historian, [[Romila Thapar]] points to archaeological evidence that "suggests the contrary" to the claim that "Pusyamitra was a fanatical anti-Buddhist" and that he "never actually destroyed 840,000 stupas as claimed by Buddhist works, if any". Thapar stresses that Buddhist accounts are probably hyperbolic renditions of Pusyamitra's attack of the Mauryas, and merely reflect the desperate frustration of the Buddhist religious figures in the face of the possibly irreversible decline in the importance of their religion under the Sungas.<ref>Asoka and the Decline of the Mauryas by Romila Thapar, Oxford University Press, 1960 P200</ref>

During the period, Buddhist monks deserted the [[Ganges]] valley, following either the northern road (''[[uttarapatha]]'') or the southern road (''dak<U+1E63>inapatha'').<ref>"Gandhara", Francine Tissot, p128: "The monks, expelled from the Ganges valley, maybe by sectarian disputes, followed the northern road (Uttarapatha) or the northern road (Daksinapatha), which conducted them to the Northwest for some, and to the Occidental ocean for the others, with multiple artistic creations marking their respective roads"</ref> Conversely, Buddhist artistic creation stopped in the old [[Magadha]] area, to reposition itself either in the northwest area of [[Gandhara|Gandh<U+0101>ra]] and [[Mathura, Uttar Pradesh|Mathura]] or in the southeast around [[Amaravati, Andhra Pradesh|Amaravati]]. Some artistic activity also occurred in central India, as in [[Bharhut|Bh<U+0101>rhut]], to which the Sungas may or may not have contributed.

In [[Bactria]] (today's northern Afghanistan), the areas west of the Indian subcontinent, neighboring Greek kingdoms had been in place since the time of the conquests of [[Alexander the Great]] around 326 BCE: first the [[Seleucids]] from around 323 BCE, then the [[Greco-Bactrian Kingdom|Greco-Bactrian kingdom]] from around 250 BCE.

[[File:Gandhara Buddha (tnm).jpeg|thumb|200px|left|A [[Greco-Buddhist]] statue, one of the first representations of the Buddha, 1st-2nd century CE, [[Gandhara]].]]

The [[Greco-Bactrian]] king [[Demetrius I of Bactria|Demetrius I]] invaded India in 180 BCE as far as [[Pataliputra|P<U+0101>taliputra]], establishing an [[Indo-Greek Kingdom|Indo-Greek kingdom]] that was to last in parts of northern India until the end of the 1st century BCE.
Buddhism flourished under the Indo-Greek kings, and it has been suggested that their invasion of India was intended to show their support for the [[Mauryan empire]] and to protect the Buddhist faith from the alleged religious persecutions of the [[Sunga]]s (185&ndash;73 BCE).

One of the most famous Indo-Greek kings is [[Menander I|Menander]] (reigned c. 160&ndash;135 BCE). He apparently converted to Buddhism and is presented in the Mah<U+0101>y<U+0101>na tradition as one of the great benefactors of the faith, on a par with king A<U+015B>oka or the later Kushan king [[Kanishka|Kani<U+015B>ka]]. Menander's coins bear the mention of the "saviour king" in Greek; some bear designs of the eight-spoked wheel. Direct cultural exchange is also suggested by the dialogue of the [[Milinda Panha|Milinda Pa<U+00F1>ha]] between [[Menander I|Menander]] and the monk [[Nagasena|N<U+0101>gasena]] around 160 BCE. Upon his death, the honor of sharing his remains was claimed by the cities under his rule, and they were enshrined in [[stupa]]s, in a parallel with the historic Buddha.<ref>[[Plutarch]], Praec. reip. ger. 28, 6</ref> Several of Menander's [[Indo-Greek]] successors inscribed "Follower of the Dharma," in the [[Kharoshthi|Kharo<U+1E63><U+1E6D>h<U+012B>]] script, on their coins, and depicted themselves or their divinities forming the ''vitarka'' [[mudra|mudr<U+0101>]].

[[File:MenanderChakra.jpg|thumb|300px|A coin of [[Menander I]] with an [[Dharmacakra|eight-spoked wheel]] and a palm of victory on the reverse ([[British Museum]]).]]
The interaction between Greek and Buddhist cultures may have had some influence on the evolution of Mah<U+0101>y<U+0101>na, as the faith developed its sophisticated philosophical approach and a man-god treatment of the Buddha somewhat reminiscent of Hellenic gods. It is also around that time that the first [[anthropomorphic]] representations of the Buddha are found, often in realistic [[Greco-Buddhist]] style: "One might regard the classical influence as including the general idea of representing a man-god in this purely human form, which was of course well familiar in the West, and it is very likely that the example of westerner's treatment of their gods was indeed an important factor in the innovation."<ref>Boardman, ''The Diffusion of Classical Art in Antiquity''</ref>

===Central Asian expansion===
<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:TilliaTepeBuddhistCoin.jpg|thumb|The Buddhist gold coin found in Tillia tepe. Tomb IV.]] -->
A Buddhist gold coin from India was found in northern [[Afghanistan]] at the archaeological site of [[Tillia Tepe]], and dated to the 1st century CE. On the reverse, it depicts a lion in the moving position with a [[nandipada]] in front of it, with the [[Kharoshthi|Kharo<U+1E63><U+1E6D>h<U+012B>]] legend "Sih[o] vigatabhay[o]" ("The lion who dispelled fear"). 

The Mahayana Buddhists symbolized Buddha with animals such as a lion, an elephant, a horse or a bull. A pair of feet was also used. The symbol called by the archaeologists and historians as "nandipada" is actually a composite symbol. The symbol at the top symbolizes 'the Middle Path,' the Buddha Dhamma. The circle with a centre symbolizes chakra. Thus, the composite symbol symbolizes 'Dhamma Chakra.' Thus, the symbols on the reverse of the coin jointly symbolize Buddha rolling the Dhamma Chakra.In the 'Lion Capital' of Saranath,India, Buddha rolling the Dhamma Chakra is depicted on the wall of the cylinder with lion, elephant, horse and bull rolling the Dhamma Chakras. 

On the obverse, an almost naked man only wearing an Hellenistic [[chlamys]] and wearing a head-dress rolls a [[dharmachakra|Buddhist wheel]]. The legend in Kharo<U+1E63><U+1E6D>h<U+012B> reads "Dharmacakrapravata[ko]" ("The one who turned the Wheel of the Law"). It has been suggested that this may be an early representation of the Buddha.<ref>"Il semble qu'on ait l<U+00E0> la plus ancienne repr<U+00E9>sentation du Buddha, selon une modalit<U+00E9> qui n'est pas encore celle de l'iconograhie boudhique traditionnelle" (French): "It seems this might be the earliest representation of the Buddha, in a style which is not yet that of traditional Buddhist iconography", in "Afghanistan, les tr<U+00E9>sors retouv<U+00E9>s", p280.</ref>

The head dress symbolizes 'the Middle Path.' Thus, the man with the head dress is a person who adheres to the Middle Path. In one of the Indus Valley seals also, we find similar head dress worn by 9 women!

Thus, on both sides of the coin, we find Buddha rolling the Dhamma chakra.

As no scientific study on literary and physical symbolization of Buddha and Buddhism was conducted by the archaeologists and historians, imaginary and false interpretations were only given on coins, seals, Brahmi and other inscriptions and other archaeological finds.

The rise of Mah<U+0101>y<U+0101>na Buddhism from the 1st century BCE was accompanied by complex political changes in northwestern India. The [[Indo-Greek]] kingdoms were gradually overwhelmed, and their culture assimilated by the [[Indo-Scythians]], and then the [[Yuezhi]], who founded the [[Kushan Empire]] from around 12 BCE.

The new form of Buddhism was characterized by the idea that all beings have a Buddha-nature and should aspire to Buddhahood, and by a syncretism due to the various cultural influences within northwestern India and the [[Kushan Empire]].

In the Kanishka coin, the composite symbol placed by the side of the enlightened Buddha symbolizes 'the Four Noble Truths that emphasize the Middle Path, the Buddha Dhamma.'

===The Two Fourth Councils===
{{Unreferenced section|date=May 2009}}
{{Main|The Fourth Buddhist Councils}}
The Fourth Council is said to have been convened in the reign of the [[Kushan]] emperor [[Kanishka|Kani<U+1E63>ka]] around 100 CE at Jalandhar or in Kashmir.  Therav<U+0101>da Buddhism had its own Fourth Council in Sri Lanka about 200 years earlier in which the P<U+0101>li canon was written down ''in toto'' for the first time. Therefore there were two Fourth Councils: one in Sri Lanka (Therav<U+0101>da), and one in Kashmir (Sarv<U+0101>stiv<U+0101>din).

[[File:ExtentOfBuddhismAndTrade.jpg|thumb|250px|Extent of Buddhism and trade routes in the 1st century CE.]]
It is said that for the Fourth Council of Kashmir, Kani<U+1E63>ka gathered 500 monks headed by [[Vasumitra]], partly, it seems, to compile extensive commentaries on the [[Abhidharma]], although it is possible that some editorial work was carried out upon the existing canon itself. Allegedly during the council there were altogether three hundred thousand verses and over nine million statements compiled, and it took twelve years to complete. The main fruit of this council was the compilation of the vast commentary known as the Mah<U+0101>-Vibh<U+0101>sh<U+0101> ("Great Exegesis"), an extensive compendium and reference work on a portion of the Sarv<U+0101>stiv<U+0101>din Abhidharma.

Scholars believe that it was also around this time that a significant change was made in the language of the Sarv<U+0101>stiv<U+0101>din canon, by converting an earlier [[Prakrit]] version into [[Sanskrit]]. Although this change was probably effected without significant loss of integrity to the canon, this event was of particular significance since Sanskrit was the sacred language of [[Vedic Brahmanism|Brahmanism]] in India, and was also being used by other thinkers, regardless of their specific religious or philosophical allegiance, thus enabling a far wider audience to gain access to Buddhist ideas and practices. For this reason there was a growing tendency among Buddhist scholars in India thereafter to write their commentaries and treatises in Sanskrit. Many of the early schools, however, such as Therav<U+0101>da, never switched to Sanskrit, partly because Buddha explicitly forbade translation of his discourses into what was an elitist religious language (as [[Latin]] was in medieval Europe). He wanted his monks to use a local language instead - a language which could be understood by all. Over time, however, the language of the Therav<U+0101>din scriptures ([[P<U+0101>li]]) became a scholarly or elitist language as well, exactly opposite to what the Buddha had explicitly commanded.

{{Further|Mahayana}}
[[File:MahayanaMap.gif|thumb|300px|Expansion of Mah<U+0101>y<U+0101>na Buddhism between the 1st&ndash;10th century CE.]]

From that point on, and in the space of a few centuries, Mah<U+0101>y<U+0101>na was to flourish and spread in the East from India to [[South-East Asia]], and towards the north to [[Central Asia]], [[China]], [[Korea]], and finally to [[Japan]] in 538 CE and [[Tibet]] in the 7th century.

===India===
{{Unreferenced section|date=May 2009}}
{{Further|History of Buddhism in India}}
After the end of the [[Kushan Empire|Kushans]], Buddhism flourished in India during the dynasty of the [[Gupta Empire|Guptas]] (4th-6th century). Mah<U+0101>y<U+0101>na centers of learning were established, especially at [[N<U+0101>land<U+0101>]] in north-eastern India, which was to become the largest and most influential Buddhist university for many centuries, with famous teachers such as [[Nagarjuna|N<U+0101>g<U+0101>rjuna]]. The influence of the Gupta style of [[Buddhist]] art spread along with the faith from south-east Asia to China.

[[File:IndianBuddha11.JPG|thumb|left|200px|Buddha and [[Bodhisattva]]s, 11th century, [[Pala Empire]].]]
Indian Buddhism had weakened in the 6th century following the [[White Hun]] invasions and Mihirkulas persecution.

[[Xuanzang]] reported in his travels across India during the 7th century of Buddhism being popular in [[Andhra]], [[Vijaywada|Dhanyakataka]], and [[Dravida]], which area today roughly corresponds to the modern day Indian states of [[Andhra Pradesh]] and [[Tamil Nadu]].<ref>''Personality of Xuanzang Sanzang'': http://www.upf.es/materials/huma/central/historia/xinamon/docums/budxidoc/miyaki.htm</ref> While reporting many deserted stupas in the area around modern day [[Nepal]] and the persecution of Buddhists by [[Shashanka|Ssanka]] in the Kingdom of [[Gouda]] in modern day West Bengal,
[[Xuanzang]] complimented the patronage of [[Harsha|Har<U+1E63>avardana]] during the same period. After the Har<U+1E63>avardana kingdom, the rise of many small kingdoms that led to the rise of the [[Rajput]]s across the gangetic plains and marked the end of Buddhist ruling clans along with a sharp decline in royal patronage until a revival under the [[P<U+0101>la Empire]] in the [[Bengal]] region. Here Mah<U+0101>y<U+0101>na Buddhism flourished and spread to [[Tibet]], [[Bhutan]] and [[Sikkim]] between the 7th and the 12th centuries before the P<U+0101>las collapsed under the assault of the Hindu [[Sena dynasty]]. The P<U+0101>las created many temples and a distinctive school of Buddhist art.
[[Xuanzang]] noted in his travels that in various regions [[Buddhism]] was giving way to [[Jainism]] and [[Hinduism]].<ref>''Buddhism in Andhra Pradesh, story of Buddhism'': http://www.indiaprofile.com/religion-culture/buddhisminandhra.htm</ref> By the 10th century Buddhism had experienced a sharp decline beyond the P<U+0101>la realms in Bengal under a resurgent Hinduism and the incorporation in [[Vaishnavite]] Hinduism of Buddha as the 9th incarnation of [[Vishnu]].<ref>[http://www.metta.lk/english/buddhism-ap.htm?bcsi_scan_40D940621B5BD15F=0&bcsi_scan_filename=buddhism-ap.htm Buddhism In Andhra Pradesh]</ref>

A milestone in the decline of Indian Buddhism in the North occurred in 1193 when [[Turkic peoples|Turkic]] Islamic raiders under [[Muhammad Khilji]] burnt N<U+0101>land<U+0101>. By the end of the 12th century, following the Islamic conquest of the Buddhist strongholds in [[Bihar]] and the loss of political support coupled with social pressures, the practice of Buddhism retreated to the Himalayan foothills in the North and [[Sri Lanka]] in the south. Additionally, the influence of Buddhism also waned due to Hinduism's revival movements such as [[Advaita]], the rise of the [[bhakti movement]] and the missionary work of [[Sufi]]s.

===Central and Northern Asia===
{{Unreferenced section|date=May 2009}}
{{Further|Silk Road transmission of Buddhism}}

====Central Asia====
[[Central Asia]] had been influenced by Buddhism probably almost since the time of the Buddha. According to a legend preserved in [[P<U+0101>li]], the language of the Therav<U+0101>din canon, two merchant brothers from Bactria named Tapassu and Bhallika visited the Buddha and became his disciples. They then returned to Bactria and built temples to the Buddha.<ref>Foltz</ref>

Central Asia long played the role of a meeting place between [[China]], [[India]] and [[Persia]]. During the 2nd century BCE, the expansion of the [[Han Dynasty|Former Han]] to the west brought them into contact with the Hellenistic civilizations of Asia, especially the [[Greco-Bactrian Kingdom]]s.  Thereafter, the expansion of [[Buddhism]] to the north led to the formation of Buddhist communities and even Buddhist kingdoms in the oases of Central Asia. Some [[Silk Road]] cities consisted almost entirely of Buddhist stupas and monasteries, and it seems that one of their main objectives was to welcome and service travelers between east and west.

The Therav<U+0101>din traditions first spread among the [[Iranian peoples|Iranian]] tribes before combining with the Mah<U+0101>y<U+0101>na forms during the 2nd and 3rd centuries BCE to cover modern-day [[Pakistan]], [[Kashmir]], [[Afghanistan]], eastern and coastal [[Iran]], [[Uzbekistan]], [[Turkmenistan]] and [[Tajikistan]]. These were the ancient states of [[Gandhara|Gandh<U+0101>ra]], [[Bactria]], [[Parthia]] and [[Sogdia]] from where it spread to [[China]]. Among the first of these states to come under the influence of Buddhism was Bactria as early as the 3rd century BCE (see [[Greco-Buddhism]]). It was not, however, the exclusive faith of this region. There were also [[Zoroastrian]]s, [[Hindu]]s, [[Nestorian Christians]], [[Jews]], [[Manichaeans]], and followers of [[shamanism]], [[Tengrism]], and other indigenous, nonorganized systems of belief.

Various [[Nik<U+0101>ya]] schools persisted in Central Asia and China until around the 7th century CE. Mah<U+0101>y<U+0101>na started to become dominant during the period, but since the faith had not developed a Nikaya approach, [[Sarvastivada|Sarv<U+0101>stiv<U+0101>dins]] and [[Dharmaguptakas]] remained the Vinayas of choice in Central Asian monasteries.

Various Buddhist kingdoms rose and prospered in both the Central Asian region and downwards into the Indian sub-continent such as the [[Kushan Empire]] prior to the [[White Hun]] invasion in the 5th century where under the King Mihirkula they were heavily persecuted.

Buddhism in Central Asia started to decline with the expansion of [[Islam]] and the destruction of many stupas in war from the 7th century. The Muslims accorded them the status of [[dhimmi]]s as "people of the Book", such as [[Christianity]] or [[Judaism]] and [[Al-Biruni]] wrote of Buddha as prophet "burxan".

Buddhism saw a surge during the reign of [[Mongols]] following the invasion of [[Genghis Khan]] and the establishment of the [[Il Khanate]] and the [[Chagatai Khanate]] who brought their [[Buddhist]] influence with them during the 13th century; however, within 100 years the [[Mongols]] who remained in that region would convert to [[Islam]] and spread Islam across all the regions of central Asia. Only the eastern Mongols and the Mongols of the [[Yuan dynasty]] would keep Vajray<U+0101>na Buddhism.

====Parthia====
{{See also|Parthia}}
Buddhism expanded westward into [[Arsacid Empire|Arsacid]] [[Parthia]], at least to the area of [[Merv]], in ancient [[Margiana]], today's territory of [[Turkmenistan]]. Soviet archeological teams have excavated in Giaur Kala near Merv a Buddhist chapel, a gigantic Buddha statue and a monastery.

Parthians were directly involved in the propagation of Buddhism: [[An Shigao]] (c. 148 CE), a Parthian prince, went to China, and is the first known translator of Buddhist scriptures into Chinese.

====Tarim Basin====
[[File:Central Asian Buddhist Monks.jpeg|thumb|180px|Blue-eyed [[Central Asia]]n and East-Asian Buddhist monks, [[Bezeklik]], Eastern [[Tarim Basin]], China, 9th-10th century.]]
The eastern part of central Asia ([[Xinjiang|Chinese Turkestan]], [[Tarim Basin]], [[Xinjiang]]) has revealed extremely rich Buddhist works of art (wall paintings and reliefs in numerous caves, portable paintings on canvas, sculpture, ritual objects), displaying multiple influences from Indian and Hellenistic cultures. [[Serindian art]] is highly reminiscent of the Gandh<U+0101>ran style, and scriptures in the Gandh<U+0101>ri script [[Kharosthi|Kharo<U+1E63><U+1E6D>h<U+012B>]] have been found.

Central Asians seem to have played a key role in the transmission of Buddhism to the East. The first translators of Buddhists scriptures into Chinese were [[Parthia]]n (Ch: Anxi) like [[An Shigao]] (c. 148 CE) or [[An Hsuan]], [[Kushan]] of [[Yuezhi]] ethnicity like [[Lokaksema]] (c. 178 CE), [[Zhi Qian]] and [[Zhi Yao]] or [[Sogdians]] (Ch: SuTe/<U+7C9F><U+7279>) like Kang Sengkai. Thirty-seven early translators of Buddhist texts are known, and the majority of them have been identified as Central Asians.

Central Asian and East Asian Buddhist monks appear to have maintained strong exchanges until around the 10th century, as shown by frescoes from the Tarim Basin.

These influences were rapidly absorbed, however, by the vigorous Chinese culture, and a strongly Chinese particularism develops from that point.

According to traditional accounts, Buddhism was introduced in China during the [[Han dynasty]] (206 BCE-220 CE) after an emperor dreamed of a flying golden man thought to be the Buddha.  Although the archaeological record confirms that Buddhism was introduced sometime during the Han dynasty, it did not flourish in China until the Six Dynasties period (220-589 CE).<ref name="Saylor">{{cite web | title = Buddhism in China: A Historical Overview | publisher = Saylor.org | url = http://www.saylor.org/site/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/ARTH406-Historical-Overview-of-Chinese-Buddhism-FINAL.pdf | format = PDF | accessdate = 7 March 2012 }}</ref>

The year 67 CE saw Buddhism's official introduction to China with the coming of the two monks [[Moton]] and [[Chufarlan]].  In 68 CE, under imperial patronage, they established the [[White Horse Temple]] (<U+767D><U+99AC><U+5BFA>), which still exists today, close to the imperial capital at [[Luoyang]]. By the end of the 2nd century, a prosperous community had settled at Pengcheng (modern [[Xuzhou]], [[Jiangsu]]).

The first known Mah<U+0101>y<U+0101>na scriptural texts are translations into Chinese by the Kushan monk Lokak<U+1E63>ema in Luoyang, between 178 and 189 CE. Some of the earliest known Buddhist artifacts found in China are small statues on "money trees", dated c. 200 CE, in typical Gandh<U+0101>ran drawing style: "That the imported images accompanying the newly arrived doctrine came from Gandh<U+0101>ra is strongly suggested by such early Gandh<U+0101>ra characteristics on this "money tree" Buddha as the high u<U+1E63>ni<U+1E63>a, vertical arrangement of the hair, moustache, symmetrically looped robe and parallel incisions for the folds of the arms."<ref>''Crossroads of Asia'', p. 209</ref>
[[File:NorthernWeiMaitreya.JPG|thumb|left|200px|[[Maitreya]] Buddha, [[Northern Wei]], 443 CE.]]
In the period between 460-525 AD during the [[Northern Wei dynasty]], the Chinese constructed [[Yungang Grottoes]], it's an outstanding example of the Chinese stone carvings from the 5th and 6th centuries. All together the site is composed of 252 grottoes with more than 51,000 Buddha statues and statuettes. 

Another famous Buddhism Grottoes is [[Longmen Grottoes]] which started with the Northern Wei Dynasty in 493 AD. There are as many as 100,000 statues within the 1,400 caves, ranging from an 1 inch (25 mm) to 57 feet (17 m) in height. The area also contains nearly 2,500 stelae and inscriptions, whence the name "Forest of Ancient Stelae", as well as over sixty Buddhist pagodas.

Buddhism flourished during the beginning of the [[Tang Dynasty]] (618&ndash;907). The dynasty was initially characterized by a strong openness to foreign influences and renewed exchanges with Indian culture due to the numerous travels of Chinese Buddhist monks to India from the 4th to the 11th century.  The Tang capital of [[Chang'an]] (today's [[Xi'an]]) became an important center for Buddhist thought.  From there Buddhism spread to [[Korea]], and Japanese embassies of Kentoshi helped gain footholds in Japan.

However, foreign influences came to be negatively perceived towards the end of the Tang Dynasty. In the year 845, the Tang emperor [[Emperor Wuzong of Tang China|Wuzong]] outlawed all "foreign" religions including Christian [[Nestorianism]], [[Zoroastrianism]], and [[Buddhism]] in order to support the indigenous [[Taoism]]. Throughout his territory, he confiscated Buddhist possessions, destroyed monasteries and temples, and executed Buddhist monks, ending Buddhism's cultural and intellectual dominance.

However, about a hundred years after the [[Great Anti-Buddhist Persecution]], [[Buddhism]] revived during the [[Song Dynasty]]    (1127&ndash;1279).

[[Pure Land]] and [[Zen|Chan]] Buddhism, however, continued to prosper for some centuries, the latter giving rise to Japanese [[Zen]].  In China, Chan flourished particularly under the [[Song dynasty]] (1127&ndash;1279), when its monasteries were great centers of culture and learning.

In the last two thousand years, the Buddhist have build [[Sacred Mountains of China|The Four Sacred Mountains of Buddhism]], they are [[Mount Wutai]], [[Mount Emei]], [[Mount Jiuhua]], [[Mount Putuo]].

Today, China boasts one of the richest collections of Buddhist arts and heritages in the world.  [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Sites]] such as the [[Mogao Caves]] near [[Dunhuang]] in [[Gansu]] province, the [[Longmen Grottoes]] near [[Luoyang]] in [[Henan]] province, the [[Yungang Grottoes]] near [[Datong]] in [[Shanxi]] province, and the [[Dazu Rock Carvings]] near [[Chongqing]] are among the most important and renowned Buddhist sculptural sites. The [[Leshan Giant Buddha]], carved out of a hillside in the 8th century during the [[Tang Dynasty]] and looking down on the confluence of three rivers, is still the largest stone Buddha statue in the world.

====Korea====
{{Main|Buddhism in Korea}}
Buddhism was introduced around 372 CE, when Chinese ambassadors visited the Korean kingdom of [[Goguryeo]], bringing scriptures and images.
Buddhism prospered in Korea - in particular Seon ([[Zen]]) Buddhism from the 7th century onward.
However, with the beginning of the [[Confucianism|Confucian]] Yi Dynasty of the [[Joseon Dynasty|Joseon period]] in 1392, a strong discrimination took place against Buddhism until it was almost completely eradicated, except for a remaining Seon movement.

====Japan====

{{Main|Buddhism in Japan}}
{{See also|Japanese Art|Zen}}
The Buddhism of Japan was introduced from [[Three Kingdoms of Korea]] in the 6th century. The Chinese priest [[Ganjin]] offered the system of Vinaya to the Buddhism of Japan in 754. As a result, the Buddhism of Japan has developed rapidly. [[Saich<U+014D>]] and [[K<U+016B>kai]] succeeded to a legitimate Buddhism from China in the 9th century.

Being geographically at the end of the [[Silk Road]], Japan was able to preserve many aspects of Buddhism at the very time it was disappearing in India, and being suppressed in Central Asia and China.

From 710 CE numerous temples and monasteries were built in the capital city of [[Nara, Nara|Nara]], such as the five-story [[pagoda]] and Golden Hall of the [[H<U+014D>ry<U+016B>-ji]], or the [[K<U+014D>fuku-ji]] temple. Countless paintings and sculptures were made, often under governmental sponsorship. The creations of Japanese Buddhist art were especially rich between the 8th and 13th century during the periods of [[Nara period|Nara]], [[Heian period|Heian]] and [[Kamakura period|Kamakura]].

From the 12th and 13th centuries, a further development was [[Zen]] art, following the introduction of the faith by [[Dogen]] and [[Eisai]] upon their return from China. Zen art is mainly characterized by original paintings (such as [[ink wash]] and the [[Enso]]) and poetry (especially [[haikus]]), striving to express the true essence of the world through impressionistic and unadorned "non-dualistic" representations. The search for enlightenment "in the moment" also led to the development of other important derivative arts such as the [[Chanoyu]] tea ceremony or the [[Ikebana]] art of flower arrangement. This evolution went as far as considering almost any human activity as an art with a strong spiritual and aesthetic content, first and foremost in those activities related to combat techniques ([[martial arts]]).

Buddhism remains very active in Japan to this day. Around 80,000 Buddhist temples are preserved and regularly restored.

====Tibet====
{{See also|Tibetan Buddhism|Tibetan art}}
Buddhism arrived late in Tibet, during the 7th century CE. The form that predominated, via the south of Tibet, was a blend of ''mah<U+0101>y<U+0101>na'' and ''vajray<U+0101>na'' from the universities of the [[Pala Empire|P<U+0101>la empire]] of north India.<ref>{{cite book |last= Conze |first= Edward |authorlink= Edward Conze |coauthors= |editor= |others= |title= A Short History of Buddhism |origdate= |origyear= |origmonth= |url= |format= |accessdate= |edition=2nd |series= |volume= |date= |year=1993 |month= |publisher= Oneworld |location= |language= |isbn=1-85168-066-7 |oclc= |doi= |id= |pages= |chapter= |chapterurl= |quote= }}</ref> [[Sarvastivada|Sarv<U+0101>stiv<U+0101>din]] influence came from the south west (Kashmir)<ref>Conze, 1993, 106</ref> and the north west ([[Khotan]]).<ref>Berzin, Alexander (2000).

''The Berzin Archives'': http://www.berzinarchives.com/web/en/index.html</ref>

From the outset Buddhism was opposed by the native shamanistic [[Bon]] religion, which had the support of the aristocracy, but with royal patronage it thrived to a peak under King R<U+00E4>lpach<U+00E4>n (817-836). Terminology in translation was standardised around 825, enabling a translation methodology that was highly literal. Despite a reversal in Buddhist influence which began under King Langdarma (836-842), the following centuries saw a colossal effort in collecting available Indian sources, many of which are now extant only in Tibetan translation.

Tibetan Buddhism exerted a strong influence from the 11th century CE among the peoples of [[Central Asia]], especially in [[Mongolia]] and [[Manchuria]]. It was adopted as an official state religion by the [[Mongol]] [[Yuan dynasty]] and the [[Manchu]] [[Qing dynasty]] that ruled [[China]].

===Southeast Asia===
{{Further|Indianized kingdom}}
[[File:Bodhisattva Lokesvara statue.jpg|thumb|Statue of the [[Bodhisattva]] [[Lokesvara]], [[Cambodia]], 12th century.]]
[[File:CambodianBuddha.JPG|thumb|Cambodian Buddha, 14th century.]]
During the 1st century CE, the trade on the overland Silk Road tended to be restricted by the rise in the Middle-East of the [[Parthia]]n empire, an unvanquished enemy of [[Rome]], just as Romans were becoming extremely wealthy and their demand for Asian luxury was rising. This demand revived the sea connections between the Mediterranean and China, with India as the intermediary of choice. From that time, through trade connection, commercial settlements, and even political interventions, India started to strongly influence [[Southeast Asia]]n countries. Trade routes linked India with southern [[Burma]], central and southern [[Siam]], lower [[Cambodia]] and southern [[Vietnam]], and numerous urbanized coastal settlements were established there.

For more than a thousand years, Indian influence was therefore the major factor that brought a certain level of cultural unity to the various countries of the region. The [[P<U+0101>li]] and [[Sanskrit]] languages and the Indian script, together with Therav<U+0101>da and Mah<U+0101>y<U+0101>na Buddhism, [[Vedic Brahmanism|Brahmanism]], and [[Hinduism]], were transmitted from direct contact and through sacred texts and Indian literature such as the [[Ramayana|R<U+0101>m<U+0101>ya<U+1E47>a]] and the [[Mahabharata|Mah<U+0101>bh<U+0101>rata]].

From the 5th to the 13th century, South-East Asia had very powerful empires and became extremely active in Buddhist architectural and artistic creation. The main Buddhist influence now came directly by sea from the Indian subcontinent, so that these empires essentially followed the Mah<U+0101>y<U+0101>na faith. The [[Sri Vijaya]] Empire to the south and the [[Khmer Empire]] to the north competed for influence, and their art expressed the rich Mah<U+0101>y<U+0101>na pantheon of the [[bodhisattva]]s.

[[File:Avalokite<U+00E7>vara, Malayu Srivijaya style.jpg|left|thumb|The graceful golden statue of [[Avalokite<U+015B>vara|Avalokite<U+00E7>vara]] in Malayu-[[Srivijaya]]n style, [[Jambi]], [[Indonesia]].]]

====Srivijayan Empire (7th&ndash;13th century)====
{{Further|Srivijaya}}
[[Srivijaya]], a maritime empire centered at [[Palembang]] on the island of [[Sumatra]] in [[Indonesia]], adopted Mah<U+0101>y<U+0101>na and Vajray<U+0101>na Buddhism under a line of rulers named the [[Sailendra]]s. [[Yijing]] described Palembang as a great centre of Buddhist learning where the emperor supported over a thousand monks at his court. [[Yijing]] also testified to the importance of Buddhism as early as the year 671 and advised future Chinese pilgrims to spend a year or two in [[Palembang]].<ref>Jerry Bently, 'Old World Encounters: Cross-Cultural Contacts and Exchanges in Pre-Modern Times (New York: Oxford University Press, 1993), 72.</ref> [[Atisha|Ati<U+015B>a]] studied there before travelling to [[Tibet]] as a missionary.

As Srivijaya expanded their [[thalassocracy]], Buddhism thrived amongst its people. However, many did not practice pure Buddhism but a new syncretism form of Buddhism that incorporated several different religions such as Hinduism and other indigenous traditions.<ref>Jerry Bently, 'Old World Encounters: Cross-Cultural Contacts and Exchanges in Pre-Modern Times (New York: Oxford University Press, 1993), 73.</ref> 

Srivijaya spread [[Buddhist art]] during its expansion in [[Southeast Asia]]. Numerous statues of [[bodhisattva]]s from this period are characterized by a very strong refinement and technical sophistication, and are found throughout the region. Extremely rich architectural remains are visible at the temple of [[Borobudur]] the largest Buddhist structure in the world, built from around 780 CE in Java, which has 505 images of the seated Buddha. Srivijaya declined due to conflicts with the [[Chola]] rulers of India, before being destabilized by the Islamic expansion from the 13th century.

====Khmer Empire (9th&ndash;13th century)====
{{Further|Khmer Empire}}
Later, from the 9th to the 13th centuries, the Mah<U+0101>y<U+0101>na Buddhist and Hindu [[Khmer Empire]] dominated much of the South-East Asian peninsula. Under the Khmer, more than 900 temples were built in Cambodia and in neighboring Thailand. [[Angkor]] was at the center of this development, with a temple complex and urban organization able to support around one million urban dwellers. One of the greatest Khmer kings, [[Jayavarman VII]] (1181&ndash;1219), built large Mah<U+0101>y<U+0101>na Buddhist structures at [[Bayon]] and [[Angkor Thom]].

====Vietnam====
{{Main|Buddhism in Vietnam}}

Following the destruction of Buddhism in mainland India during the 11th century, Mah<U+0101>y<U+0101>na Buddhism declined in southeast Asia, to be replaced by the introduction of Therav<U+0101>da Buddhism from Sri Lanka.

==Emergence of the Vajray<U+0101>na (5th century)==
{{Main|Vajrayana}}
[[Vajrayana|Vajray<U+0101>na]] Buddhism, also called tantric Buddhism, first emerged in eastern India between the 5th and 7th centuries CE. It is sometimes  considered a sub-school of Mah<U+0101>y<U+0101>na and sometimes a third major "vehicle" (''y<U+0101>na'') of Buddhism in its own right. The Vajray<U+0101>na is an extension of Mah<U+0101>y<U+0101>na Buddhism in that it does not offer new philosophical perspectives, but rather introduces additional techniques (''upaya'', or 'skilful means'), including the use of visualizations and other yogic practices. Many of the practices of tantric Buddhism are common with [[Hinduism|Hindu]] [[tantra|tantricism]]: the usage of [[mantra]]s, [[yoga]] and the burning of sacrificial offerings.

Early Vajray<U+0101>na practitioners were forest-dwelling [[mahasiddha]]s who lived on the margins of society, but by the 9th century Vajray<U+0101>na had won acceptance at major Mah<U+0101>y<U+0101>na monastic universities such as [[Nalanda|N<U+0101>land<U+0101>]] and [[Vikramashila|Vikrama<U+015B><U+012B>la]]. Along with much of the rest of Indian Buddhism, the Vajray<U+0101>na was eclipsed in the wake of the late 12th century Muslim invasions. It has persisted in Tibet, where it was wholly transplanted from the 7th to 12th centuries, and on a limited basis in Japan as well where it evolved into [[Shingon Buddhism]].

==Therav<U+0101>da Renaissance (11th century CE&mdash; )==
{{Further|Theravada}}
[[File:TheravadaMap2.gif|thumb|300px|Expansion of Therav<U+0101>da Buddhism from the 11th century CE.]]
From the 11th century, the destruction of Buddhism in the Indian mainland by Islamic invasions led to the decline of the Mah<U+0101>y<U+0101>na faith in South-East Asia. Continental routes through the Indian subcontinent being compromised, direct sea routes developed from the [[Middle-East]] through [[Sri Lanka]] to [[China]], leading to the adoption of the Therav<U+0101>da Buddhism of the [[Pali canon|P<U+0101>li canon]], introduced to the region around the 11th century CE from [[Sri Lanka]].

King [[Anawrahta]] (1044&ndash;1077); the historical founder of the [[Burma|Burmese]] empire, unified the country and adopted the Therav<U+0101>din Buddhist faith. This initiated the creation of thousands of Buddhist temples at [[Bagan|Pagan]], the capital, between the 11th and 13th century. Around 2,000 of them are still standing. The power of the Burmese waned with the rise of the [[Thai (ethnic group)|Thai]], and with the seizure of the capital Pagan by the [[Mongols]] in 1287, but Therav<U+0101>da Buddhism remained the main Burmese faith to this day.

The Therav<U+0101>da faith was also adopted by the newly founded ethnic [[Thailand|Thai]] kingdom of [[Sukhothai kingdom|Sukhothai]] around 1260. Therav<U+0101>da Buddhism was further reinforced during the [[Ayutthaya kingdom|Ayutthaya]] period (14th&ndash;18th century), becoming an integral part of Thai society.

In the continental areas, Therav<U+0101>da Buddhism continued to expand into [[Laos]] and [[Cambodia]] in the 13th century. From the 14th century, however, on the coastal fringes and in the islands of south-east Asia, the influence of [[Islam]] proved stronger, expanding into [[Malaysia]], [[Indonesia]], and most of the islands as far as the southern [[Philippines]].

Nevertheless, since [[Suharto]]'s rise to power in 1966, there has been a remarkable renaissance of Buddhism in Indonesia. This is partly due to the requirements of Suharto's New Order for the people of [[Indonesia]] to adopt one of the five official religions: [[Islam]], [[Protestantism]], [[Catholicism]], [[Hinduism]] or [[Buddhism]]. Today it is estimated there are some 10 millions Buddhists in Indonesia. A large part of them are people of Chinese ancestry.

==Expansion of Buddhism to the West==
{{Further|Western Buddhism}}
[[File:Josaphat.jpg|thumb|300px|[[Josaphat (saint)|Saint Josaphat]] preaching Christianity. 12th century Greek manuscript.]]
After the Classical encounters between Buddhism and the West recorded in Greco-Buddhist art, information and legends about Buddhism seem to have reached the West sporadically.  An account of Buddha's life was translated in to [[Greek language|Greek]] by [[John of Damascus]], and widely circulated to [[Christianity|Christians]] as the story of [[Barlaam]] and [[Josaphat (saint)|Josaphat]].  By the 14th century this story of Josaphat had become so popular that he was made a [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]] saint.

The next direct encounter between Europeans and Buddhism happened in Medieval times when the [[Franciscan]] friar [[William of Rubruck]] was sent on an embassy to the [[Mongol]] court of [[Mongke]] by the French king [[Louis IX of France|Saint Louis]] in 1253. The contact happened in Cailac (today's Qayaliq in [[Kazakhstan]]), and William originally thought they were wayward Christians (Foltz, "Religions of the Silk Road").

In the period after [[Hulagu]], the Mongol [[Ilkhanate|Ilkhans]] increasingly adopted Buddhism. Numerous Buddhist temples dotted the landscape of [[Persia]] and [[Iraq]], none of which survived the 14th century. The Buddhist element of the Il-Khanate died with [[Arghun]].<ref>''The Islamic World to 1600: The Mongol Invasions (The Il-Khanate)'':http://www.ucalgary.ca/applied_history/tutor/islam/mongols/ilkhanate.html</ref>

The [[Kalmyk people|Kalmyk Khanate]] was founded in the 17th century with Tibetan Buddhism as its main religion, following the earlier migration of the [[Oirats]] from Dzungaria through [[Central Asia]] to the steppe around the mouth of the [[Volga River]]. During the course of the 18th century, they were absorbed by the Russian Empire.<ref>''NUPI - Centre for Russian Studies'': http://www2.nupi.no/cgi-win//Russland/etnisk_b.exe?Kalmykian Kalmyks</ref> At the end of the [[Napoleonic wars]], Kalmyk cavalry units in Russian service entered [[Paris]].<ref>''History of Kalmykia, Government of the Republic of Kalmykia'': http://kalm.ru/en/hist.html</ref> [[Kalmykia]] is remarkable for being the only state in [[Europe]] where the dominant religion is Buddhism.

Interest in Buddhism increased during the colonial era, when Western powers were in a position to witness the faith and its artistic manifestations in detail. The opening of [[Japan]] in 1853 created a considerable interest in the arts and culture of Japan, and provided access to one of the most thriving Buddhist cultures in the world.

Buddhism started to enjoy a strong interest from the general population in the West following the turbulence of the 20th century. In the wake of the [[1959 Tibetan uprising]], a [[Tibetan diaspora]] has made Tibetan Buddhism in particular more widely accessible to the rest of the world. It has since spread to many Western countries, where the tradition has gained popularity. Among its prominent exponents is the [[14th Dalai Lama]] of Tibet. The number of its adherents is estimated to be between ten and twenty million.<ref>Adherents.com estimates twenty million for "Lamaism (Vajrayana/Tibetan/Tantric)." http://www.adherents.com/adh_branches.html#Buddhism</ref>
