== History ==
{{main|History of Toronto|Name of Toronto|Amalgamation of Toronto}}

When [[Europe]]ans first arrived at the site of present-day Toronto, the vicinity was inhabited by the [[Huron]] tribes, who by then had displaced the [[Iroquois]] tribes that had occupied the region for centuries before c. 1500. The name ''Toronto'' is likely derived from the Iroquois word ''tkaronto'', meaning "place where trees stand in the water".<ref name=etymology>{{cite web|url=http://geonames.nrcan.gc.ca/education/toronto_e.php|title=The real story of how Toronto got its name|publisher=[[Natural Resources Canada]] (2005)|accessdate=2006-12-08}}</ref> It refers to the northern end of what is now [[Lake Simcoe]], where the Huron had planted tree saplings to corral fish. A [[portage]] route from Lake Ontario to [[Lake Huron]] running through this point, the [[Toronto Carrying-Place Trail]], led to widespread use of the name.

[[France|French]] traders founded [[Fort Rouill<U+00E9>]] on the current [[Exhibition Place|Exhibition grounds]] in 1750, but abandoned it in 1759.<ref name=rouille>[http://schools.tdsb.on.ca/jarvisci/toronto/rouille.htm Fort Rouill<U+00E9>], Jarvis Collegiate Institute (2006). Retrieved on 2006-[[December 8|12-08]].</ref> During the [[American Revolutionary War]], the region saw an influx of [[British Empire|British]] settlers as [[United Empire Loyalists]] fled for the unsettled lands north of Lake Ontario. In 1787, the British negotiated the [[Toronto Purchase]] with the [[Mississaugas]] of [[Mississaugas of the New Credit First Nation|New Credit]], thereby securing more than a quarter million acres (1000&nbsp;km<U+00B2>) of land in the Toronto area.<ref name=British>[http://www.toronto.ca/culture/history/history-natives-newcomers.htm Natives and newcomers, 1600-1793], City of Toronto (2006). Retrieved on 2006-[[December 8|12-08]].</ref>

In 1793 Governor [[John Graves Simcoe]] established the town of [[York, Upper Canada|York]] on the existing settlement, naming it after [[Prince Frederick, Duke of York and Albany]]. Simcoe chose the town to replace [[Niagara-on-the-Lake|Newark]] as the capital of [[Upper Canada]],<ref>{{cite web

The town's settlement formed at the eastern end of the harbour behind the peninsula, near the present-day intersection of [[Parliament Street (Toronto)|Parliament Street]] and [[Front Street (Toronto)|Front Street]] (in the [[Corktown, Toronto|Corktown]]-[[St. Lawrence, Toronto|St. Lawrence]] area).

[[File:Toronto 1894large.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Map of Toronto, 1894]]
In 1813 as part of the [[War of 1812]], the [[Battle of York]] ended in the town's capture and plunder by American forces.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.udata.com/users/hsbaker/york.htm|title=Battle of York|accessdate=2007-07-10}}</ref> The surrender of the town was negotiated by [[John Strachan]]. American soldiers destroyed much of Fort York and set fire to the parliament buildings during their five-day occupation. The sacking of York was a primary motivation for the [[Burning of Washington]] by British troops later in the war.

York was incorporated as the City of Toronto on March 6, 1834, reverting to its original native name. The population of only 9,000 included escaped [[African American]] slaves fleeing [[Black Codes (United States)|Black Codes]] in some states.<ref name=black>[http://www.toronto.ca/archives/blackhistory.htm Black history at the City of Toronto Archives], City of Toronto (2009). Retrieved on 2009-03-13.</ref> [[Slavery in Canada|Slavery]] was banned outright in Upper Canada in 1834. Reformist politician [[William Lyon Mackenzie]] became the first Mayor of Toronto, and led the unsuccessful [[Upper Canada Rebellion]] of 1837 against the British colonial government. The city grew rapidly through the remainder of the 19th century, as a major destination for immigrants to Canada. The first significant population influx occurred with the [[Great Irish Famine]] brought a large number of Irish to the city, some of them transient and most of them [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]]. By 1851, the Irish-born population had become the largest single ethnic group in the city. Smaller numbers of [[Protestantism|Protestant]] Irish immigrants were welcomed by the existing Scottish and English population, giving the [[Orange Order]] significant and long lasting influence over Toronto society.

Toronto was twice for brief periods the capital of the united [[Province of Canada]] first from 1849&ndash;1852, following unrest in Montreal, and later 1856-1858 after which Quebec became capital until 1866 (one year before [[Canadian Confederation|Confederation]]); since then, the capital of Canada has remained [[Ottawa]].<ref>[http://www.statoids.com/uca.html Canada Provinces<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> As it had been for Upper Canada from 1793, Toronto became the capital of the province of Ontario after its official creation in 1867, the seat of government located at the Ontario Legislature located at [[Queen's Park (Toronto)|Queen's Park]]. Because of its provincial capital status, the city was also the location of [[Government House (Ontario)|Government House]], the residence of the [[Viceroy|vice-regal]] representative of the [[Monarchy in Canada|Crown]].

In the 19th century an extensive sewage system was built, and streets became illuminated with [[gas lighting]] as a regular service. Long-distance railway lines were constructed, including a route completed in 1854 linking Toronto with the Upper Great Lakes. The [[Grand Trunk Railway]] and the [[Northern Railway of Canada]] joined in the building of the first [[Old Union Station (Toronto)|Union Station]] in downtown. The advent of the railway dramatically increased the numbers of immigrants arriving, commerce and industry, as had the Lake Ontario steamers and schooners entering port before which enabled Toronto to become a major gateway linking the world to the interior of the North American continent.

Toronto became the largest alcohol [[distillation]] (in particular ''spirits'') centre in North America, the [[Gooderham and Worts Distillery]] operations became the world's largest whiskey factory by the 1860s. A preserved section of this once dominant local industry remains in the [[Distillery District]], the harbour allowed for sure access of grain and sugar imports used in processing. Expanding port and rail facilities brought in Northern Timber for export and imported Pennsylvania coal, industry dominated the waterfront for the next 100 years.

Horse-drawn streetcars gave way to electric streetcars in 1891, when the city granted the operation of the transit franchise to the [[Toronto Railway Company]]. The public transit system passed into public ownership in 1921 as the [[Toronto Transportation Commission]], later renamed the [[Toronto Transit Commission]]. The system now has the third-highest ridership of any city public transportation system in North America.<ref name="autogenerated1">[http://www.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/story/CTVNews/1122072619227_40/?hub=CTVNewsAt11 Toronto transit chief says searches unlikely] (2005).

[[File:1TorontoFire1904.jpg|thumb|left|225px|The [[Great Toronto Fire]] of 1904.]]
The [[Great Toronto Fire]] of 1904 destroyed a large section of downtown Toronto, but the city was quickly rebuilt. The fire had cost more than $10 million in damage, led to more stringent fire safety laws, and the expansion of the city's fire department. In 1954, a half-century later, disaster struck the city again when [[Hurricane Hazel]] brought intense winds and flash flooding. In the Toronto area, 81 people were killed, nearly 1,900 families were left homeless, and the hurricane caused more than $25 million in damage.<ref name=hurricane>[http://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/sos/002028-3200-e.html SOS!

The city received new immigrant groups beginning in the late 19th century into early 20th century, particularly [[German people|Germans]], [[French people|French]], [[Italian people|Italians]], and [[Jews]] from various parts of [[Eastern Europe]]. They were soon followed by [[Chinese people|Chinese]], [[Russian people|Russians]], [[Poles]] and immigrants from other [[Eastern European]] nations, as the [[Irish people|Irish]] before them, many of these new migrants lived in overcrowded shanty type slums, such as "[[The Ward, Toronto|the Ward]]" which was centred on [[Bay Street]], now the heart of the country's finances. Despite its fast paced growth, by the 1920s Toronto's population and economic importance in Canada remained second to the much longer established [[Montreal]]. However, by 1934 the [[Toronto Stock Exchange]] had become the largest in the country.

Following the [[World War II|Second World War]] refugees from war-torn Europe and Chinese job-seekers arrived. So too did construction labourers, particularly from [[Italy]] and [[Portugal]]. Following elimination of racially based [[immigration]] policies by the late 1960s, immigration began from all parts of the world. Toronto's population grew to more than one million in 1951 when large-scale [[suburbanization]] began, and doubled to two million by 1971. By the 1980s, Toronto had surpassed Montreal as Canada's most populous city and the chief economic hub. During this time, in part owing to the political uncertainty raised by the resurgence of the [[Quebec sovereignty movement]], many national and multinational corporations moved their head offices from Montreal to Toronto and other western Canadian cities.<ref>[http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3683/is_200201/ai_n9069631/pg_1 Westward ho?

In 1954 the City of Toronto and 12 surrounding municipalities were federated into a [[regional municipality|regional government]] known as [[Metropolitan Toronto]].<ref>[http://www.e-laws.gov.on.ca/DBLaws/RepealedStatutes/English/90m62_e.htm Municipality of Metropolitan Toronto Act]{{dead link|url=http://www.e-laws.gov.on.ca/DBLaws/RepealedStatutes/English/90m62_e.htm|date=March 2009}}, [[Government of Ontario]] (2000). Retrieved on 2006-[[December 29|12-29]].</ref> The postwar boom had resulted in rapid suburban development, and it was believed that a coordinated land use strategy and shared services would provide greater efficiency for the region. The metropolitan government began to manage services that crossed municipal boundaries, including [[highway]]s, police services, water and [[public transit]]. In 1967, the seven smallest municipalities of Metropolitan Toronto were merged into their larger neighbours, resulting in a six-municipality configuration that included the old, i.e. pre-1954 [[Old Toronto, Ontario|City of Toronto]] and the surrounding municipalities of [[East York, Ontario|East York]], [[Etobicoke]], [[North York, Ontario|North York]], [[Scarborough, Ontario|Scarborough]] and [[York, Ontario|York]]. In 1998, the metropolitan government was dissolved by the Provincial Government in the face of vigorous opposition from the smaller component municipalities and all six municipalities were [[amalgamation (politics)|amalgamated]] into a single municipality, creating the current City of Toronto, where [[David Miller (Canadian politician)|David Miller]] is the current Mayor.

The city celebrated its 175th anniversary on March 6, 2009, since its in inception as the City of Toronto in 1834.

The city is intersected by two rivers and numerous tributaries: the [[Humber River (Ontario)|Humber River]] in the west end and the [[Don River (Ontario)|Don River]] east of downtown at opposite ends of the [[Toronto Harbour]]. The harbour was naturally created by sediment build-up from lake currents that created the [[Toronto Islands]]. The many creeks and rivers cutting from north toward the lake created large tracts of densely forested [[Toronto ravine system|ravines]], and provide ideal sites for parks and recreational trails. However, the ravines also interfere with the city's [[grid plan]], and this results in major thoroughfares such as [[Finch Avenue]], [[Leslie Street]], [[Lawrence Avenue]], and [[St. Clair Avenue]] terminating on one side of ravines and continuing on the other side. Other thoroughfares such as the [[Prince Edward Viaduct]] are required to span above the ravines. These deep ravines prove useful for draining the city's vast storm sewer system during heavy rains, but some sections, particularly near the Don River are prone to sudden, heavy floods. Storage tanks at waste treatment facilities will often receive too much river discharge causing them to overflow, allowing untreated sewage to escape into Lake Ontario closing local beaches for swimming.

During the [[Last glacial period|last ice age]], the lower part of Toronto was beneath [[Glacial Lake Iroquois]]. Today, a series of [[escarpment]]s mark the lake's former boundary, known as the ''Iroquois Shoreline''. The escarpments are most prominent from [[Victoria Park Avenue]] to the mouth of [[Highland Creek (Toronto)|Highland Creek]], where they form the [[Scarborough Bluffs]]. Other observable sections include the area near [[St. Clair Avenue]] West between [[Bathurst Street]] and the Don River, and north of Davenport Road from Caledonia to Spadina Road; the [[Casa Loma]] grounds sit above this escarpment. Despite its deep ravines, Toronto is not remarkably hilly, but elevation differences range from {{convert|75|m|ft|0}} above-sea-level at the Lake Ontario shore to {{convert|270|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} ASL near the [[York University]] grounds in the city's north end.

Much of the current lakeshore land area fronting the Toronto Harbour is artificial landfill filled during the late 19th century. Until then the lakefront docks (then known as wharves) were set back further inland than today. Much of the adjacent [[Portlands]] are also fill. The Toronto Islands were a natural landspit until a storm in 1858 severed their connection to the mainland, creating a channel later used by shipping interests to access the docks.

=== Climate ===
[[File:Day243highparkp.jpg|left|thumb|Late spring scene in [[High Park]], in Toronto's west end]]
Toronto's climate is moderate for Canada owing to its southerly location within the country.
It has a [[humid continental climate]] ([[Koppen climate classification]] ''Dfa''), with warm, humid summers and cold winters. The city experiences four distinct seasons with considerable variance in day to day temperature, particularly during the colder weather season. Owing to urbanization and proximity to water, Toronto has a fairly low diurnal temperature range (day-night temperature difference). In general, the denser urban scape makes for warmer nights all year around and is not as cold throughout the winter than surrounding areas (particularly north of the city), however it can be noticeably cooler on many spring/early summer afternoons under the influence of a lake breeze.
Other low-scale maritime effects on the climate include [[lake effect snow]], [[fog]] and delaying of spring- and fall-like conditions, known as [[seasonal lag]].

[[File:Dundas and University Winter.JPG|right|thumb|180px|Early Winter scene at the intersection of [[Dundas Street (Toronto)|Dundas Street]] and [[University Avenue (Toronto)|University Avenue]]]]

Toronto winters sometimes feature short cold snaps where maximum temperatures remain below {{convert|-10|C|F|0|abbr=on}}, often made to feel colder by [[wind chill]]. Snowstorms, sometimes mixed with ice and rain can disrupt work and travel schedules, accumulating snow can fall anytime from November until mid-April. However, mild stretches with temperatures in the 5 to 12&nbsp;<U+00B0>C (40 to 54&nbsp;<U+00B0>F) range and infrequently higher also occur in most winters melting accumulated snow. Summer in Toronto is characterized by long stretches of humid weather. Usually in the range from {{convert|23|C|F|0|abbr=on}} to {{convert|31|C|F|0|abbr=on}}, daytime temperatures occasionally surpass {{convert|35|C|F|0|abbr=on}} accompanied by high humidity making it feel oppressive during these brief periods of hot weather. Spring and Autumn are transitional seasons with generally mild or cool temperatures with alternating dry and wet periods.

Precipitation is fairly evenly distributed throughout the year, but summer is usually the wettest season, the bulk falling during thunderstorms. There can be periods of dry weather, but drought-like conditions are rare. The average yearly precipitation is {{convert|83|cm|in|0|abbr=on}}, with an average annual snowfall of about {{convert|133|cm|in|0|abbr=on}}. Toronto experiences an average of 2,038 sunshine hours or 44% of daylight hours, varying between a low of 27% in December to 59% in July.<ref name=climate>[http://www.climate.weatheroffice.ec.gc.ca/climate_normals/results_e.html?Province=ALL&StationName=toronto&SearchType=BeginsWith&LocateBy=Province&Proximity=25&ProximityFrom=City&StationNumber=&IDType=MSC&CityName=&ParkName=&LatitudeDegrees=&LatitudeMinutes=&LongitudeDegrees=&LongitudeMinutes=&NormalsClass=A&SelNormals=&StnId=5051& Canadian climate normals for 1971 to 2000], [[Environment Canada]] (2004).

[[File:Rogers Center-restitched.jpg|upright|thumb|left|The [[CN Tower]] viewed from [[Rogers Centre]] (originally called SkyDome)]]

According to knowledgeable Toronto residents, and [[architect]]s who have designed buildings in the city, such as [[Will Alsop]], Toronto has no single, dominant architectural style. Lawrence Richards, a member of the faculty of architecture at the [[University of Toronto]], has said "Toronto is a new, brash, rag-tag place <U+2014> a big mix of periods and styles."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.where.ca/Toronto/article_feature~listing_id~95.htm|title=Toronto Architecture}}</ref> Toronto buildings vary in design and age with many structures dating back to the mid-1800s, while other prominent buildings were just newly built in the 2000s.

Defining the Toronto skyline is the [[CN Tower]]. At a height of 553.33 metres (1,815&nbsp;ft, 5 in) it was the world's tallest<ref>[http://www.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/story/CTVNews/20070913/cn_tower_070913/20070913?hub=SciTech Dubai building surpasses CN Tower in height], [[CTV Television Network]] (2007). Retrieved on 2007-[[September 13|09-13]].</ref> freestanding structure until 2007 when it was surpassed by the [[Burj Dubai]], but it is still the tallest tower in the western hemisphere surpassing [[Chicago]]'s [[Sears Tower]] by 110 metres in height. It is an important telecommunications hub, and a centre of tourism in Toronto.

[[File:Still shot from YEARS AGO movie und1080.jpg|thumb|225px|[[Art Gallery of Ontario]]]]

Toronto is a city of high-rises, having over 2,000 buildings over 90 metres (300&nbsp;ft) in height, second only to [[New York City]] (which has over 5,000 such buildings) in North America.<ref>[http://www.emporis.com/en/bu/sk/st/ma/ci/ Emporis list of cities by high rise building.]</ref> Most of these buildings are residential (either rental or condominium), whereas the Central business district contains the taller commercial office towers. There has been recent media attention given for the need to retrofit many of these buildings, which were constructed beginning in the 1950s as residential apartment blocks to accommodate a quickly growing population.

In contrast, Toronto has also begun to experience an architectural overhaul within the past five years. The [[Royal Ontario Museum]], the [[Gardiner Museum]], the [[Art Gallery of Ontario]], and the [[Ontario College of Art and Design]] are just some of the many public art buildings that have undergone massive renovations.<ref>[http://www.livewithculture.ca/livewithculture_ca/about/cultural_renaissance_projects/toronto_s_cultural_renaissance Toronto<U+2019>s Cultural Renaissance], City of Toronto (2005). Retrieved on 2007-[[November 9|11-09]].</ref> The historic [[Distillery District]], located on the eastern edge of downtown, is North America's largest and best preserved collection of Victorian era industrial architecture. It has been redeveloped into a pedestrian-oriented arts, culture and entertainment neighbourhood. Modern glass and steel highrises have begun to transform the majority of the downtown area as the condominium market has exploded and triggered widespread construction throughout the city's centre. [[Trump International Hotel and Tower (Toronto)|Trump International Hotel and Tower]], [[Ritz-Carlton]], [[Four Seasons Hotels and Resorts]], [[Shangri-La Hotels and Resorts]] are just some of the many high rise luxury condominium-hotel projects currently under construction in the downtown core.

=== Neighbourhoods ===
{{seealso|List of neighbourhoods in Toronto|History of neighbourhoods in Toronto}}
[[File:Toronto - ON - Toronto Skyline2.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Aerial view of downtown Toronto.]]
The many residential communities of Toronto express a character distinct from that of the skyscrapers in the commercial core. [[Victorian era|Victorian]] and [[Edwardian]]-era residential buildings can be found in enclaves such as [[Rosedale, Toronto|Rosedale]], [[Cabbagetown, Toronto|Cabbagetown]], [[The Annex]], and [[Yorkville, Toronto|Yorkville]]. [[Wychwood Park]] is historically significant for the architecture of its homes, and for being one of Toronto's earliest planned communities. The Wychwood Park neighbourhood was designated as an Ontario Heritage Conservation district in 1985. The [[Casa Loma (neighbourhood)|Casa Loma]] neighbourhood is named after [[Casa Loma]], a storybook castle built in 1911 complete with stunning gardens, multiple turrets, massive stables, an elevator, secret passages, and bowling alleys. [[Spadina House]] is a 19th century [[manor house|manor]] that is now a museum.

The City of Toronto encompasses a geographical area formerly administered by six separate municipalities. These municipalities have each developed a distinct history and identity over the years, and their names remain in common use among Torontonians. Throughout the city there exist hundreds of small neighbourhoods and some larger neighbourhoods covering a few square kilometres. Former municipalities include [[East York, Ontario|East York]], [[Etobicoke]], [[North York, Ontario|North York]], [[Old Toronto]], [[Scarborough, Ontario|Scarborough]], and [[York, Ontario|York]].

[[File:Toronto map.png|thumb|300px|Map of Toronto with major traffic routes]]

The [[Old Toronto|Old City of Toronto]] covers the area generally known as [[Downtown Toronto|Downtown]]. It is the historic core of Toronto and remains the most densely populated part of the city. The [[Financial District, Toronto|Financial District]] contains the largest cluster of [[skyscraper]]s in Canada, including the [[First Canadian Place]], [[Toronto Dominion Centre]], [[Scotia Plaza]], [[Royal Bank Plaza]], [[Commerce Court]] and [[Brookfield Place]]. From that point, the Toronto skyline extends northward along Yonge Street. Old Toronto is also home to many historically wealthy residential enclaves, such as [[Yorkville, Toronto|Yorkville]], [[Rosedale, Toronto|Rosedale]], [[The Annex]], [[Forest Hill, Toronto|Forest Hill]], [[Lawrence Park, Toronto|Lawrence Park]], [[Lytton Park]], [[Moore Park, Toronto|Moore Park]], and [[Casa Loma - Neighbourhood|Casa Loma]], most stretching away from downtown to the north. These neighbourhoods generally feature upscale homes, luxury condominiums and high-end retail. At the same time, the downtown core vicinity includes neighbourhoods with a high proportion of recent immigrants and low-income families living in social housing and rental [[high-rise]]s, such as [[St. James Town]], [[Regent Park]], [[Moss Park]], [[Alexandra Park, Toronto|Alexandra Park]] and [[Parkdale, Toronto|Parkdale]]. East and west of Downtown, neighbourhoods such as [[Kensington Market]], [[Leslieville]], [[Cabbagetown]] and [[Riverdale, Toronto|Riverdale]] are home to bustling commercial and cultural areas as well as vibrant communities of artists with studio lofts, with an increasing proportion of middle and upper class professionals that mix with the working poor or those on some form of government assistance. {{Fact|date=March 2008}} Other neighbourhoods in the central city retain an ethnic identity, including two [[Chinatown, Toronto|Chinatowns]], the popular [[Greektown, Toronto|Greektown]] area, the trendy [[Little Italy, Toronto|Little Italy]], [[Portugal Village, Toronto|Portugal Village]], and [[Gerrard Street (Toronto)|Little India]] along with others.

[[File:Toronto Row Houses.jpg|left|thumb|Row houses in [[Old Toronto]]; some of the houses shown have the distinctive [[bay-and-gable]] design, common in many parts of Old Toronto.]]
The inner suburbs are contained within the former municipalities of [[York, Ontario|York]] and [[East York, Ontario|East York]]. These are mature and traditionally working class areas, primarily consisting of post-[[World War I]] small, single-family homes and small apartment blocks. Neighbourhoods such as [[Crescent Town]], [[Thorncliffe Park]], [[Weston, Ontario|Weston]], and [[Oakwood-Vaughan]] mainly consist of high-rise apartments which are home to many new immigrant families. Recently, many neighbourhoods have become ethnically diverse and have undergone [[gentrification]], as a result of increasing population and a housing boom during the late 1990s and 2000s. The first neighbourhoods affected were [[Leaside]] and [[North Toronto]], gradually progressing into the western neighbourhoods in York. Some of the area's housing is in the process of being replaced or remodelled.

The outer suburbs comprising the former municipalities of [[Etobicoke]] (west), [[Scarborough, Ontario|Scarborough]] (east) and [[North York, Ontario|North York]] (north) largely retain the [[grid plan]] laid before post-war development. Sections were long established and quickly growing towns before the suburban housing boom began and the advent of Metro Government, existing towns or villages such as [[Mimico, Ontario|Mimico]], [[Islington, Ontario|Islington]] and [[New Toronto]] in Etobicoke; [[Willowdale, Ontario|Willowdale]], [[Newtonbrook, Ontario|Newtonbrook]] and [[Downsview]] in North York; [[Agincourt, Ontario|Agincourt]], [[Wexford, Ontario|Wexford]] and [[West Hill, Ontario|West Hill]] in Scarborough where suburban development boomed around or between these and other towns beginning in the late 1940s. Upscale neighbourhoods were built such as the [[Bridle Path, Toronto|Bridle Path]] in North York, the area surrounding the [[Scarborough Bluffs]] in [[Guildwood]], and most of central Etobicoke, such as [[Humber Valley Village]], and [[The Kingsway]]. One of largest and earliest "planned communities" was [[Don Mills, Ontario|Don Mills]], parts of which were first built in the 1950s.<ref>"Plan town of 45,000 on Don Mills farms; Will cost $200,000,000," Paul L. Fox, ''[[Toronto Star]]'', March 12, 1953, p. 3. Retrieved on 2007-[[May 2|05-02]].</ref> Phased development mixing single-detached housing with higher density apartment blocks became more popular as a suburban model of development. To some this model has been copied in other GTA municipalities surrounding Toronto, albeit with less population density. Over the last few decades, the [[North York Centre]] that runs along [[Yonge Street]] and the [[Scarborough City Centre]] have emerged as secondary business centres outside the downtown core. High-rise development in these areas have given North York and Scarborough distinguishable skylines of their own and a more downtown feel with high-density transit corridors serving them.

=== Industrial ===
[[File:HPIM1243.jpg|thumb|225px|The [[Distillery District]].]]
In the earlier industrial era of Toronto, industry became concentrated along the [[Toronto Harbour]] and lower [[Don River]] mouth.

The [[Distillery District]] contains the largest and best-preserved collection of [[Victorian architecture|Victorian]] industrial architecture in North America. Once the largest alcohol processing centre in North America, related structures along the Harbour include the Canada Malting Co. grain processing towers and the [[Redpath Sugar Museum|Redpath Sugar Refinery]]. Although production of spirits has declined over the decades, Toronto still has a robust and growing [[microbrewery]]industry.

The District is a national heritage site, it was listed by [[National Geographic]] magazine as a "top pick" in Canada for travellers. Similar areas that still retain their post-industrial character, but are now largely residential are the [[Fashion District, Toronto|Fashion District]], [[Corktown, Toronto|Corktown]], and parts of [[Riverdale, Toronto|South Riverdale]] and [[Leslieville]]. Toronto still has some active older industrial areas, such as [[Brockton Village]], [[Mimico]] and [[New Toronto]]. In the west end of Old Toronto and York, the [[Weston, Ontario|Weston]]/[[Mount Dennis]] and [[The Junction|Junction]] areas have a sense of grit to them, as they still contain factories, meat packing facilities and railyards close to medium density residential.

Beginning in the late 19th century as Toronto sprawled out, industrial areas were set up on the outskirts. Over time, pockets of insutrial land mostly followed rail lines and later highway corridors as the city grew outwards. This trend continues to this day, the largest factories and distribution warehouses have mostly moved to the suburban environs of [[Regional Municipality of Peel|Peel]] and [[Regional Municipality of York|York]] Regions; but also within the current city: Etobicoke (concentrated around [[Toronto Pearson International Airport|Pearson Airport]]), North York, and Scarborough. Many of Toronto's [[Brownfield land|former industrial sites]] close to (or Downtown) have been redeveloped including parts of the [[Toronto waterfront]] and [[Liberty Village]], large-scale development is underway in the [[West Don Lands]].

The still mostly vacated [[Port Lands]] remain largely undeveloped, apart from a [[Portlands Energy Centre|power plant]], a shipping container facility and out-of-commission industrial facilities. There are future plans for development, including residential areas under the guidance of [[Waterfront Toronto]].

=== Public spaces ===
{{see also|List of Toronto parks}}
[[File:Dundas Square.jpg|thumb|left|225px|[[Yonge-Dundas Square]], one of the busiest squares in the city]]
Toronto has a diverse array of public spaces, from city squares to public parks overlooking [[Toronto ravine system|ravines]]. A group called the [[Toronto Public Space Committee]] was formed to protect the city's public spaces. [[Nathan Phillips Square]] is the city's main square in downtown, and forms the entrance to [[Toronto City Hall|City Hall]]. [[Yonge-Dundas Square]], a newer square not far from City Hall, has also gained attention in recent years as one of the busiest gathering spots in the city. Other squares include [[Harbourfront Centre, Toronto|Harbourfront Square]], on the revitalized [[Toronto waterfront]], and the civic squares at the former city halls of the defunct Metropolitan Toronto, most notably [[Mel Lastman Square]] in North York.

[[File:Hto Park Urban Beach 2.jpg|thumb|right|[[HTO Park]], Toronto's first artificial urban beach]]
There are many large downtown parks, which include [[Grange Park, Toronto|Grange Park]], [[Moss Park]], [[Allan Gardens]], [[Queen's Park (Toronto)|Queen's Park]], [[Riverdale Park]], [[Trinity Bellwoods Park]], [[Christie Pits]], and the [[Leslie Street Spit]], which is [[Tommy Thompson Park]] on weekends. The [[Toronto Islands]] have several acres of park space, accessible from downtown by ferry. Large parks in the outer areas include [[High Park]], [[Humber Bay Park]], [[Centennial Park (Toronto)|Centennial Park]], [[Downsview Park]], [[Guild Inn|Guildwood Park]], and [[Rouge Park]]. An almost hidden park is the compact [[Cloud Gardens]],<ref>{{cite web

The [[Distillery District]] is a pedestrian village containing [[boutiques]], art galleries, restaurants, artist studios and small breweries, including the well-known [[Mill Street Brewery]]. A new theatre in the district, the [[Young Centre for the Performing Arts]], is the home of the [[Soulpepper Theatre Company]] and the drama productions of nearby [[George Brown College]].

The production of domestic and foreign film and television is a major local industry. Many movie releases are screened in Toronto before wider release in North America. The [[Toronto International Film Festival]] is one of the most important annual events for the international film industry. Europe's largest film studio, [[Pinewood Studios]] Group of London, is scheduled to open a major new film studio complex in west-end Toronto, with five sound stages, with the first two to open by fall 2008.

Toronto's [[Caribana]] festival takes place from mid-July to early August of every summer, and is one of North America's largest street festivals.<ref name=Caribana>[http://www.caribana.com/ Toronto Caribbean Carnival (Caribana) Festival 2006], WORD Magazine (2006). Retrieved on 2006-[[December 11|12-11]].</ref> Primarily based on the [[Trinidad and Tobago Carnival]], the first Caribana took place in 1967 when the city's [[Caribbean]] community celebrated [[Canada's Centennial]] year. Forty years later, it has grown to attract one million people to Toronto's [[Lake Shore Boulevard]] annually. Tourism for the festival is in the hundred thousands, and each year, the event generates about $300 million in revenue.

[[Pride Week (Toronto)|Pride Week]] in Toronto takes place in late June, and is one of the largest [[LGBT]] festivals in the world. One of the largest events in the city, it attracts more than one million people from around the world.

Toronto is a [[single-tier municipality]] governed by a [[Mayor-council government|mayor-council system]]. The structure of the municipal government is stipulated by the [[City of Toronto Act]]. The [[Mayor of Toronto]] is elected by direct popular vote to serve as the [[Head of government|chief executive]] of the city. The [[Toronto City Council]] is a [[Unicameralism|unicameral]] legislative body, comprising 44 councillors representing geographical [[Ward (politics)|wards]] throughout the city. The mayor and members of the city council serve four-year terms without [[term limit]]s.
