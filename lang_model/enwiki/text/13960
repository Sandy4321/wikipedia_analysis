'''''Ed, Edd n Eddy''''' is an [[Cartoon series|animated television series]] created by [[Danny Antonucci]] and produced by Canada<U+2013>based [[Danny Antonucci#International Rocketship and MTV work|a.k.a. Cartoon]]. It premiered on [[Cartoon Network]] on January 4, 1999. The series was designed to resemble classic cartoons from the 1940s to the 1970s, and revolves around three adolescent boys collectively known as "the Eds", who hang around in a suburban [[cul-de-sac]]. Unofficially led by Eddy, the Eds constantly invent schemes to make money from their peers to purchase their favorite confectionery, [[Gobstopper|jawbreakers]]. Their plans usually fail, leaving them in various predicaments.

Before signing a contract with Cartoon Network, Antonucci approached [[Nickelodeon]] with the show, but the channel demanded creative control of the show, which Antonucci did not agree to. During the show's run on Cartoon Network, a.k.a. Cartoon  produced several specials and shorts in addition to the regular television series. Several video games either based on the series or featuring the series' characters have been produced. The series' TV movie finale, ''[[List of Ed, Edd n Eddy episodes#Film|Ed, Edd n Eddy's Big Picture Show]]'' aired on November 8, 2009, officially ending the series.

''Ed, Edd n Eddy'' received generally positive reviews from critics. The show attracted an audience of 31 million households, was broadcast in 29 countries, and was popular among children and adults. It received several awards and nominations during its 10-year run and remains the longest-running [[Cartoon Network original series and movies|original Cartoon Network series]] and Canadian-made animated series to date.

==Series overview==
{{See also|List of Ed, Edd n Eddy characters|List of Ed, Edd n Eddy episodes}}
''Ed, Edd n Eddy'' follows the lives of three adolescent boys who all share variations of the name Ed, but differ greatly in their personalities. In the pursuit of buying jawbreakers, dimwitted Ed and intellectual Double D aid the self-appointed leader, Eddy, in his plans to scam the other children in their cul-de-sac out of their money; however problems always ensue. The other children mostly dislike or show indifference to the Eds, though they all share a common fear of the Kanker Sisters, a group of teenage girls who live in a nearby trailer park.

Ed is the strong, dimwitted workhorse of the group. Edd, better known as Double D, is a young inventor, neat freak, and the most intelligent of the Eds. Eddy is a greedy, ill-tempered con artist, loudmouth, and self-appointed leader of the Eds. Jonny 2x4 is a loner whom his peers consider to be a nuisance; he spends most of his time with his imaginary friend, a wooden board named Plank. Jimmy is a weak, effeminate and insecure child, who is most often seen spending his time with Sarah, Ed's bossy, spoiled, and short-tempered little sister. Rolf is an immigrant, who often participates in odd customs and eats strange food. Kevin is a stereotypical, cynical, and sarcastic jock who hates the Eds and can be cruel at times. Nazz, usually seen with Kevin, is a stereotypical and unattainable love interest. May, Maire, and Lee Kanker, better known as the "Kanker Sisters", are the main antagonists of the series and are in love with the three Eds.

Aside from the Eds, the other characters in the cul-de-sac, and the Kanker Sisters, no other characters appeared in the series until the fifth season, when the silhouettes of other people were occasionally shown, and in one episode the arms of Eddy<U+2019>s father and Ed<U+2019>s mother were seen. In the series finale, ''Ed, Edd n Eddy's Big Picture Show'', Eddy<U+2019>s adult brother was seen for the first time, making him the only non-main character, and the only adult character to ever fully appear on the show. The series takes place mostly within the fictional town of Peach Creek, and new locations were rarely introduced. The first four seasons of the show are set during a perpetual summer, though from the fifth season onwards, the characters were shown going to school.

==Production==
Having worked on various cartoons for [[Hanna-Barbera]], the show's creator Danny Antonucci felt confined to gross and edgy work, such as his series ''[[The Brothers Grunt]]'', and decided to produce another animated children's television show.<ref name="Season1DVD"/> He wanted to ensure that the series was produced in a way similar to the cartoons from the 1940s to the 1970s.<ref name="Season1DVD">{{cite video|people=[[Danny Antonucci]]|date=October 10, 2006|title=Ed, Edd n Eddy: The Complete First Season<U+2014>''Interview with the Creator''|time=0:22<U+2013>2:34|format=DVD|publisher=[[Warner Home Video]]}}</ref> Antonucci spent months designing the show, then tried to sell it to Nickelodeon and Cartoon Network. Both studios were enthusiastic and wanted to see more, however they each demanded creative control and Antonucci refused. A deal was ultimately made for Cartoon Network to commission the show, after they agreed to let Antonucci have control of the show.<ref name="Season1DVD"/>

Antonucci, an advocate of hand-drawn animation, used wobbling animation in ''Ed, Edd n Eddy'' as a homage to the hand-drawn cartoons of the period 1940 to 1970.<ref name="Season1DVD"/> To give the impression of movement, ''Ed, Edd n Eddy'' uses shimmering character outlines similar to [[Squigglevision]].<ref name="AnimationWorldMagazine2"/> The crawling lines are not as noticeable as those in ''[[Dr. Katz, Professional Therapist]]'', but are still visible,<ref name="AnimationWorldMagazine2">{{cite news|first=Matt|last=Shumway|coauthors=Wayne, Lamont|title=Ed, Edd n Eddy: A Unique Approach|date=June 1999|url=http://www.awn.com/mag/issue4.03/4.03pages/SCAD_EEE.php3|work=Animation World Magazine|issue=4.3|accessdate=July 31, 2008}}</ref> and Antonucci likens it to cartoons of the 1930s.<ref name="Season1DVD"/>

According to Antonucci, he based the characters on real people in his life; the personalities of Ed, Edd, and Eddy are based on his own traits, and the activities of his two sons while the cul-de-sac children and the Kanker sisters were all based on children he grew up with.<ref name="Season1DVD-1">{{cite video|people =[[Danny Antonucci]]|date=October 10, 2006|title=Ed, Edd n Eddy: The Complete First Season<U+2014>''Interview with the Creator''|time=2:15<U+2013>4:39|format=DVD|publisher=[[Warner Home Video]]}}</ref> He stated that he believed it was important to add Plank, a board of wood, to the show, and that he "thought it would be really cool to do the show with Plank taking on a character of his own" and to cause Jonny to do things he would usually never do.<ref name="Season1DVD-1"/> Rolf is strongly based on Antonucci and his cousins, since he was part of an immigrant family, and grew up in a first generation foreign household with different customs and ways of living.<ref name="Season1DVD-1"/>

The series' finale movie, ''Ed, Edd n Eddy's Big Picture Show'', aired on November 8, 2009, and officially ended the series.<ref name="BigPS"/> However, reruns continued on Cartoon Network, and on April 6, 2012, also began to air as part of the revived animated variety show ''[[Cartoon Planet]]''.<ref>{{cite news|title=Cartoon Network Brings Back 'Powerpuff Girls,' 'Dexter's Laboratory' And More With 'Cartoon Planet' (VIDEO)|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/03/29/cartoon-network-cartoon-planet_n_1388362.html|work=[[The Huffington Post]]|publisher=[[AOL]]|accessdate=May 5, 2012|date=March 29, 2012}}</ref>

==Additional works==
Besides their own series, Ed, Edd and Eddy have also appeared in other cartoon series. They appeared in an episode of ''[[Foster's Home for Imaginary Friends]]'' and were drawn using that series' style of animation,<ref name="Fosters">{{cite episode|title=Eddie Monster|series=[[Foster's Home for Imaginary Friends]]|network=Cartoon Network|date=July 22, 2005|season=3}}</ref> and made a short [[cameo appearance|cameo]] in "The Grim Adventures of the Kids Next Door"; a [[Fictional crossover|crossover]] of ''[[The Grim Adventures of Billy & Mandy]]'' and ''[[Codename: Kids Next Door]]''.

The show was featured in a fictional awards program, [[The 1st 13th Annual Fancy Anvil Awards Show Program Special: Live in Stereo]], in which it won Best Performance by a Inanimate Object in a Dramatic Role for the character of Plank, and Best Performance by a Team in a Cartoon Series for the characters of Ed, Edd and Eddy. The character of Sarah was nominated for Best Performance by a Female in a Cartoon Series, but lost to [[List of The Powerpuff Girls characters#Bubbles|Bubbles]] from ''[[The Powerpuff Girls]]''.<ref name="FancyAnvil">{{cite episode|title=[[The 1st 13th Annual Fancy Anvil Awards Show Program Special: Live in Stereo]]|network=Cartoon Network|date=March 23, 2002}}</ref>

Cartoon Network has also produced short cartoons involving the Eds which were shown during commercial breaks. A short music video was produced with stylized versions of Ed, Edd, Eddy and Sarah, entitled "The Incredible Shrinking Day" (listed on the Season 2 DVD as "I'm Not Coming in Anymore"),<ref name="Season2DVD">{{cite video|date=April 27, 2007|title=Ed, Edd n Eddy: The Complete Second Season<U+2014>''"I'm Not Coming in Anymore"''|format=DVD|publisher=''[[Warner Home Video]]''}}</ref> which aired on Cartoon Network in 2002 and 2003. In the video, Sarah uses a potion to shrink the Eds to a size capable of playing in her dollhouse, with predictable results.<ref name="Sarah">{{cite episode|title=The Incredible Shrinking Day|series=Ed, Edd n Eddy|network=Cartoon Network|year=2002/2003}}</ref> Plank starred in a similar video called "My Best Friend Plank", which aired in 2002.<ref name="Plank">{{cite episode|title=My Best Friend Plank|series=Ed, Edd n Eddy|network=Cartoon Network|year=2002}}</ref>

Cartoon Network aired several all day [[Marathon (television)|marathon]]s for either commercial promotions or special airings for one of their shows. A marathon called "The Best Day Edder", in which every episode was shown in chronological order, aired from April 27 to April 28, 2007, and ended with the previously unbroadcast last episode of season 5.<ref name="BestDayEdder">{{cite episode|title=The Best Day Edder|series=Ed, Edd n Eddy|network=Cartoon Network|date=April 27<U+2013>28, 2007}}</ref>

A special episode of ''Ed, Edd n Eddy'', in which aliens invade Rolf's house, aired on May 11, 2007.

''Ed, Edd n Eddy'' received generally positive reviews from critics. David Cornelius considered the Eds to be adolescent equivalents of [[The Three Stooges]], believing that "the series revels in the sort of frantic, often gross humor kids love so much, and there's just enough oddball insanity at play to make adults giggle just as easily."<ref name="DVDTalk">{{cite web|url=http://www.dvdtalk.com/reviews/28046/ed-edd-n-eddy-the-complete-second-season/|title=DVD Talk Review: Ed, Edd 'n' Eddy <U+2014> The Complete Second Season|accessdate=July 31, 2007|last=Cornelius|first=David|date=April 24, 2007|work=[[DVD Talk]]}}</ref> Cornelius also wrote that the "animation is colorful and intentionally bizarre; bold lines forming the characters and backgrounds wiggle and morph in a delirious haze.
