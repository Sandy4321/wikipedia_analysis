'''Harry Edwin Strom''' (July 7, 1914<U+2013>October 2, 1984) was [[Premier of Alberta]], [[Canada]], from 1968 to 1971.  His two and a half years as Premier were the last of the thirty-six year [[Social Credit Party of Alberta|Social Credit]] dynasty, as his defeat by [[Peter Lougheed]] saw its replacement by a new era [[Progressive Conservative Association of Alberta|Progressive Conservative]] government.  He is remembered as an honest, decent man who lacked the political skills of his predecessor, [[Ernest Manning]], or of Lougheed.

Alberta's first native-born Premier, Strom was born in [[Burdett, Alberta|Burdett]], [[Alberta]].  He worked most of his young adult life on the family farm, and was also actively involved in his church.  After a stint in municipal politics, he ran for the [[Legislative Assembly of Alberta]] in the [[Alberta general election, 1955|1955 provincial election]], and was elected.  In 1962, Manning appointed him to his cabinet as Minister of Agriculture, a position he held until 1967 when he was appointed Minister of Municipal Affairs.  When Manning decided to resign in 1968, Strom became a candidate to succeed him, and finished on top of a six candidate field.

As Premier, Strom undertook a number of initiatives, especially in education and youth-related fields, but was politically ineffective.  He lacked both charisma and an overriding sense of purpose, and his government gradually lost popularity.  In the [[Alberta general election, 1971|1971 election]], his government was handily defeated by Lougheed's Conservatives.  Strom served as opposition leader for two years, but soon relinquished the position and did not seek re-election in [[Alberta general election, 1975|1975]]. After leaving politics, Strom returned to farming.  He died in 1984.

==Early life==

Strom was born in [[Burdett, Alberta]], on July 7, 1914.  He parents, Nels Strom and Elna Ekensteen, were second generation [[Swedish Canadian]]s.  He attended school in Burdett before moving to [[Calgary]] to attend high school at East Calgary High School and Calgary Technical High School, where he studied mechanics.<ref name="Barr 186"/>  In 1931, he received a certificate from the Provincial Institute of Technology and Art.  His father died the same year, and Strom returned home to help his mother with the operation of the family farm.<ref name="legbio">{{cite web |url=http://www.assembly.ab.ca/lao/library/PREMIERS/strom.htm |title=The Honourable Harry E. Strom, 1968-71 |publisher=Legislative Assembly of Alberta |accessdate=2008-07-18}}</ref>

On October 27, 1938, Strom married Ruth Johnson, with whom he would have six children<U+2014>Howard, Faith, Beverly, Brian, Ronald, and Arlene.<ref name="legbio"/>  The family attended the [[Evangelical Free Church of Canada]] in [[Bow Island]] until 1962.  There, Strom served as [[Sunday school]] teacher, [[deacon]], and board chair, in addition to his twenty years of involvement with the church's Overseas Missions Board.<ref name="legbio"/>  Besides his activities with the church, Strom was involved in the [[Forty Mile County No. 8, Alberta|Forty Mile]] Rural Electrification Association, the Burdett Home and School Association, and the Agricultural Improvement Association of Burdett.<ref name="legbio"/>

==Entry into politics==

In 1943, Harry Strom was elected to the council of [[Forty Mile County No. 8, Alberta]].<ref name="legbio"/>  He served on local school boards at around the same time.<ref name="legbio"/>

===MLA and cabinet minister===

In the [[Alberta general election, 1955|1955 provincial election]], Strom ran as the [[Social Credit Party of Alberta|Social Credit]] candidate in [[Cypress (provincial electoral district)|Cypress]], where the incumbent, Social Crediter [[James Underdahl]], was not seeking re-election.<ref name="legbio"/>  He easily defeated his only opponent, [[Alberta Liberal Party|Liberal]] Joe Flaig, and was elected to the [[Legislative Assembly of Alberta]].<ref name="1955 results">{{cite web |url=http://www.abheritage.ca/abpolitics/database/maps_choice.asp?Year=1955&Constit=Cypress |publisher=Alberta Online Encyclopedia |title=Election results for Cypress, 1955 |accessdate=2008-07-21}}</ref>  He would be re-elected to this seat in each of the [[Alberta general election, 1959|1959]], [[Alberta general election, 1963|1963]], [[Alberta general election, 1967|1967]], and [[Alberta general election, 1971|1971]] elections, always winning more than 60% of the vote.<ref name="legbio"/>

In October 1962, Premier [[Ernest Manning]] appointed Strom Minister of Agriculture.<ref name="legbio"/>  In this capacity, he undertook a series of initiatives related to water use, including developing an agreement with [[Saskatchewan]] and [[Manitoba]] of the use of water emanating from the eastern slopes of Alberta's [[Rocky Mountains]].<ref name="legbio"/>  He also passed a series of legislation, including the ''Soil Conservation Act'' and ''Crop Insurance Act'', and undertook a major departmental organization.<ref name="HOF">{{cite web |title=Strom, Harry - 1985 Hall of Fame Inductee |publisher=Alberta Agriculture Hall of Fame |url=http://www1.agric.gov.ab.ca/$Department/deptdocs.nsf/all/info2064?opendocument |accessdate=2008-07-21}}</ref>  The Alberta Agriculture Hall of Fame, which inducted Strom in 1985, credited him with expanding the use of [[irrigation]] in the province and for being a key figure leading up to the signing of a 1973 cost-sharing agreement on the subject with the [[Government of Canada|federal government]].<ref name="HOF"/>  He also served as Minister of Municipal Affairs for the last five months of the Manning government.<ref name="legbio"/>

===Leadership convention===
{{mainarticle|Alberta Social Credit leadership convention, 1968}}

When Manning decided to retire in 1968, he called a key group of senior ministers to his office to advise them of his decision.<ref name="Barr 185">Barr 185</ref>  This group includes Strom, Treasurer [[Anders Aalborg]], Industry Minister [[Russ Patrick]], Education Minister [[Randy McKinnon]].<ref name="Barr 185"/>  Aalborg was the natural choice to succeed Manning, but he had health problems and declined to run.<ref name="Barr 185"/>  Strom had no desire for the job and rejected any suggestion from the others that he be a candidate.<ref name="Barr 185"/>

This rejection was not to last: a group of influential young Social Crediters, including the Premier's son [[Preston Manning|Preston]], started a movement to draft Strom.<ref name="Barr 186">Barr 186</ref>  They settled on him because he was personally popular among party members and because he had displayed an openness to new ideas in the past.<ref name="Barr 186"/>  Strom accepted their overtures, but as late as a week before he announced his candidacy he was still offering to step aside in favour of another candidate of the young Turks' choice.<ref name="Barr 186"/>

Strom's campaign theme was "the social development of Alberta", and this general theme encompassed such diverse policy planks as a citizens' committee on constitutional reform, a [[head start]] program for disadvantaged youth, commissions on the future of urban planning and education, an expansion of the role of [[backbenchers]] in policy development, and the opening of a branch of the Premier's office in Calgary.<ref name="Barr 187">Barr 187</ref>  Though he entered as the favourite,<ref name="Barr 187"/> a poll in spring 1969 showed him running second of five candidates behind Minister of Transportation [[Gordon Taylor]].<ref name="Barr 188">Barr 188</ref>  However, he had the strongest organization of any candidate, thanks in large part to his young backers,<ref name="Barr 187"/> and overcame this deficit by the fall.<ref name="Barr 188"/>

At the [[Alberta Social Credit leadership convention, 1968|convention]], Strom won a large plurality on the first ballot, finishing with nearly three times of the votes of the second place Taylor.<ref name="Barr 188"/>  Though the third place [[Raymond Reierson]] threw his support to the Transportation Minister before the second ballot, the results on this were decisive: Strom gained the support of more than a hundred new delegates and won a clear majority.<ref name="Barr 189">Barr 189</ref>

==Premier==

Harry Strom became Premier December 12, 1968 and served until the [[Alberta general election, 1971|1971 election]], when his government was defeated by [[Peter Lougheed]]'s [[Progressive Conservative Association of Alberta|Progressive Conservatives]].<ref name="legbio"/>  This tenure makes him the second shortest-serving former Premier in Alberta's history, after [[Richard G. Reid]] (current Premier [[Ed Stelmach]] has also served less time than Strom, but will exceed his term September 11, 2009).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.assembly.ab.ca/lao/library/PREMIERS/index.htm |title=Premiers of the Northwest Territories and Alberta from 1897 to the present |publisher=Legislative Assembly of Alberta |accessdate=2008-07-24}}</ref>

===Policy initiatives===

Many of Strom's policy initiatives revolved around education and youth.  He created the Alberta Service Corps, which allowed young Albertans to work summers on public services and environmental projects for remuneration, and which was one of several models for the federal government's later [[Katimavik]] program.<ref name="Barr 192">Barr 192</ref>  In response to increasing use of illicit drugs by Alberta youth, his government, led by Education Minister [[Robert Curtis Clark|Bob Clark]], inserted anti-[[narcotics]] messages into the province's school curriculum.<ref name="Barr 192"/>  Strom implemented trial [[kindergarten]] programs in [[Edmonton]] and Calgary<U+2014>the Calgary program, provided jointly by an inner-city community association and the [[Mount Royal College]], has been called one of Canada's first [[public-private partnerships]].<ref name="Barr 192"/>  His interest in educational matters was perhaps best exemplified by his government's Commission on Educational Planning, which travelled the province to solicit Albertans' views and whose final report, ''A Choice of Futures'', was credited by Barr as setting "the tone and direction for education in Alberta for the next generation".<ref name="Barr 192"/>  The Strom government also made substantial reforms to Alberta's post-secondary education system, expanding [[distance learning]] through the creation of [[Athabasca University]] and laying the foundation's for [[Access (TV channel)|ACCESS television]], and effectively creating the province's College (as distinct from University) system.  This latter move led to the creation of [[Grant MacEwan College]].<ref name="Barr 193">Barr 193</ref>

Strom also took a number of non-educational policy initiative, such as naming [[Jim Henderson (Alberta politician)|Jim Henderson]] as the province's first Environment Minister.  Other priorities were the reform of the Premier's Office and the establishment of an Intergovernmental Affairs Secretariat, converted by [[Peter Lougheed]]'s government into a full ministry under [[Don Getty]].<ref name="Barr 190">Barr 190</ref><ref name="Barr 191">Barr 191</ref>  In 1970, the government established the Alberta Alcoholism and Drug Abuse Commission.<ref name="legbio"/>

===Leadership style===

Strom resisted leadership and saw himself as a conciliator, charged with maintaining unity among his cabinet and caucus.<ref name="Barr 191"/>  Soon after becoming Premier, Strom chief of staff Don Hamilton and strategist Owen Anderson scheduled strategy meetings with agendas drawn from Strom's leadership platform.<ref name="Barr 189"/>  The meetings did not lead to action, and some began to grumble that "talking about decisions was a form of action".<ref name="Barr 189"/>  According to Barr, Hamilton eventually started using the same agenda every week, with only the date changed, and Strom did not notice.<ref name="Barr 189"/>

Strom was not an effective speaker, and often wouldn't look at the test of his speeches until he was delivering them.<ref name="Barr 190"/>  Realizing this, Hamilton once handed him a folder with nothing but a paper reading "Sock it to 'em, Harry" before the Premier was to give a speech at the [[University of Alberta]].<ref name="Barr 190"/>  The Premier opened the folder and, as he became visibly alarmed, gratefully received the real speech when an aide brought it to him.<ref name="Barr 190"/>

Strom also resisted calling an early election to give his government a fresh mandate, despite Hamilton's impassioned advocacy for this course of action..<ref name="Barr 189"/>  He was no more positive towards Anderson's proposals for a radical overhaul of the party, including the computerization of political data (such as voting trends, demographic shifts, and polling results) and the purchase of an office building to make the party a profit and free it from the need for fundraising.<ref name="Barr 190"/>  The ideas that Strom did not reject outright were referred to committees and study groups where they were watered down or shelved.<ref name="Barr 190"/>

Despite these failings, Strom was recognized as possessing a number of virtues: he was kind, considerate, and honest.<ref name="Barr 199">Barr 199</ref>  Most of all, he was humble: he had not sought the party leadership, and notoriously asked after being repeatedly addressed as "Premier" at his first cabinet meeting why it couldn't "just be plain 'Harry' anymore".<ref name="Barr 199"/>  When travelling to [[Ottawa]], he stayed at the un-posh Skyline Hotel and ate meals in its basement cafeteria, where he ordered bread and [[pea soup]] for $0.25.<ref name="Barr 190"/>  On final analysis, Barr concludes that this temperament, commendable though it may be, was unsuited to running the government of an emerging economic powerhouse.<ref name="Barr 199"/>

===Defeat===

Though the legislature's mandate from the [[Alberta general election, 1967|1967 election]] was not due to expire until May 1972, five years after it started, convention in Canadian politics is for legislatures to be dissolved every four years or less.<ref name="Barr 193"/>  Accordingly, Strom resolved to call an election in 1971, sometime between May and September.<ref name="Barr 193"/>  After considering the spring, in the hopes that the planting season would have farmers feeling optimistic and therefore inclines to support the incumbent government, Strom finally settled on August 30 (partly out of concerns that farmers would resent an election called in the middle of the planting or harvest seasons).<ref name="Barr 193"/><ref name="Barr 195">Barr 195</ref>  A campaign committee was assembled, and recommended a budget of $580,000.<ref name="Barr 194">Barr 194</ref>

The party recruited star candidates, including Calgary alderman [[George Ho Lem]] and former [[Calgary Stampeders|Calgary Stampeder]] star [[Don Luzzi]] (Edmonton alderman and future mayor [[Cec Purves]] was defeated in his bid to win the Social Credit nomination in [[Edmonton-Strathcona]] from [[Strathcona Centre]] incumbent [[Joseph Donovan Ross]]), but was handicapped in these efforts by Strom's unwillingness to offer cabinet posts or other incentives to potential new candidates.<ref name="Barr 193"/><ref name="Barr 194"/>  Strom's lack of personal charisma was also a liability: tellingly, of the large budget recommended by the central committee, only $72,000 was recommended for use on television advertising, where Strom did not shine.<ref name="Barr 194"/>  The party tried to revitalize the Premier's image through publicity movies, though efforts were mixed.<ref name="Barr 193"/>  In one, which was pulled after a single showing, Strom appeared scowling in his living room, urging Albertans to lower their expectations of government.<ref name="Barr 193"/>  Another, produced by [[Tommy Banks]] and showing Strom in a variety of settings talking about the province's changing face, was more successful.<ref name="Barr 194"/>

The campaign did not give Social Credit partisans much reason for optimism.  Strom did not draw the crowds that [[Progressive Conservative Association of Alberta|Progressive Conservative]] [[Peter Lougheed]] did, although an August 25 rally in Edmonton's Jubilee Auditorium featuring speeches by Strom and Manning was full.<ref name="Barr 196-197">Barr 196-197</ref>  After criticizing the Conservatives' [[Medicare (Canada)|medicare]] platform, which promised free medicare to Albertans older than 65, as spendthrift, Strom announced Social Credit's barely cheaper alternative: medicare to Albertans older than 65 for one dollar per month.<ref name="Barr 195"/>  The [[Edmonton Journal]], which had earlier published a poll showing that a plurality of Edmontonians intended to vote P.C., endorsed Lougheed for Premier.<ref name="Barr 196-197"/>  Election night saw Social Credit defeated, taking 25 seats to the P.C.s' 49.<ref name="Barr 198">Barr 198</ref>  Though Social Credit's share of the vote had only slipped slightly, Lougheed benefited from a substantial reduction in the [[Alberta New Democratic Party|New Democrats]]' vote and a near-collapse of the [[Alberta Liberal Party|Liberals]]'.<ref name="Barr 198"/>  Strom conceded defeat in Edmonton and flew home to [[Medicine Hat]].<ref name="Barr 198"/>

==Out of office and legacy==

Strom continued as Social Credit leader, serving as leader of the opposition, until 1972, when he resigned and was replaced by [[Werner Schmidt]].<ref name="Barr 198"/>  He continued in the legislature until the [[Alberta general election, 1975|1975 election]], in which he did not seek re-election.<ref name="Barr 198"/>  After leaving politics, he returned to his farm and his involvement with his church.  He died October 2, 1984, and was buried in [[Medicine Hat]].<ref name="Barr 198"/>

In honour of his political services, Strom received honorary [[Doctor of Laws]] degrees from the [[University of Calgary]] (1969), the [[University of Lethbridge]] (1979), and the [[University of Alberta]] (1980).<ref name="legbio"/>  While several of his acts as premier had consequences extending well beyond his term, today he is largely forgotten, though he experienced a brief resurgence in name recognition in 2007.<ref name="Barr 191"/>  That year, critics of [[Ed Stelmach]] compared Stelmach to Strom, with the insinuation being that Stelmach was destined to lose the next election and be the last of the Progressive Conservative dynasty in the same way that Strom was the last of the Social Credit dynasty.<ref>{{cite news |first=Dawn |last=Walton |title=Stelmach confronts ghost of Harry Strom |work=Globe and Mail |url=http://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/Page/document/v5/content/subscribe?user_URL=http://www.theglobeandmail.com%2Fservlet%2FArticleNews%2Ffreeheadlines%2FLAC%2F20061204%2FSTROM04%2Fnational%2FNational&ord=22852337&brand=theglobeandmail&force_login=true |date=2006-12-04 |accessdate=2008-02-12 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |first=Sheila |last=Pratt |title=Are there parallels with 1971? |work=Edmonton Journal |url=http://www.canada.com/edmontonjournal/news/ideas/story.html?id=6dc106ea-2f47-4ab4-95c6-7f394ea93f0e |date=2007-06-13 |accessdate=2008-02-12 }}</ref>
