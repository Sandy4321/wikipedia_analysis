'''Carnitine-acylcarnitine translocase deficiency''' is a rare condition that prevents the body from converting long-chain fatty acids into energy, particularly during periods without food. [[Carnitine]], a natural substance acquired mostly through the diet, is used by cells to process fats and produce energy. People with this disorder have a faulty enzyme that prevents long-chain fatty acids from being transported into the innermost part of the [[mitochondria]] for processing.

The signs of carnitine-acylcarnitine translocase deficiency usually begin within the first few hours of life. [[Seizure]]s, an irregular [[heartbeat]], and breathing problems are often the first signs of this disorder. This disorder may also cause extremely low levels of [[ketone]]s (products of fat breakdown that are used for energy) and low blood sugar ([[hypoglycemia]]). Together, these two signs are called hypoketotic hypoglycemia. Other signs that are often present include ammonia in the blood ([[hyperammonemia]]), an enlarged liver ([[hepatomegaly]]), heart abnormalities ([[cardiomyopathy]]), and muscle weakness. This disorder can cause [[sudden infant death syndrome|sudden infant death]].

Mutations in the ''SLC25A20'' [[gene]] lead to the production of a defective version of an enzyme called carnitine-acylcarnitine translocase. Without this enzyme, long-chain fatty acids from food and fats stored in the body cannot be broken down and processed. As a result, these fatty acids are not converted into energy, which can lead to characteristic signs and symptoms of this disorder, such as weakness, hypoglycemia, and an irregular heartbeat. Free long-chain fatty acids or those that are joined with carnitine can affect the electrical properties of cardiac cells causing an irregular heart beat ([[arrhythmia]], which can lead to cardiac arrest). Fatty acids may also build up in tissues and can damage the heart, liver, and muscles, and cause more serious complications.
