[[File:Ethnic Groups Turkey123.png|thumb|300px|Ethnic groups of Turkey]]

'''Minorities in Turkey''' form a substantial part of the country's population. While the [[Republic of Turkey]], following the 1923 [[Treaty of Lausanne]], recognizes [[Armenians]], [[Greeks]] and [[Jews]] as [[Ethnic minority|ethnic minorities]], this legal status is not granted the [[Kurds]], which constitute the largest minority by a wide margin, nor all the other minorities in the country.

== Ethnic minorities ==
===Albanians===
According to some newspapers, the [[National Security Council (Turkey)|National Security Council]] of Turkey requested a report on the ethnic groups living in Turkey, where the population of ethnic Albanians was determined to be around 500,000.<ref>[http://www.milliyet.com.tr/default.aspx?aType=SonDakika&Kategori=yasam&ArticleID=873452&Date=07.06.2008&ver=16] ''500 bin Arnavut da ise <U+00E7>ok canl<U+0131> bir <U+015F>ekilde 'Arnavutluk <U+015F>uuru' var.''</ref>

=== Arabs ===
{{Main|Arabs in Turkey}} 
Arabs in Turkey number between 500 thousand and 1 million, and they mostly live in provinces near the Syrian border. Most of them are [[Sunni]] and [[Alawi]] Muslims. However there is a small community of Arameans whom are often identified as [[Christian Arabs]].

=== Armenians ===

The majority belong to the [[Armenian Apostolic]] faith, with much smaller numbers of [[Armenian Catholic Church|Armenian Catholics]] and [[Armenian Evangelical Church|Armenian Evangelicals]].

=== Arameans/Assyrians ===
{{Main|Assyrians in Turkey}}
{{Further|Syriac Genocide}}
Arameans/Assyrians were once a large ethnic minority in the [[Ottoman Empire]], but following the early 20th century [[Assyrian Genocide|Syriac Genocide]], many were murdered or emigrated. Now, they live in small numbers in eastern Turkey and Istanbul.

=== Azerbaijanis ===

=== Circassians ===
{{Main|Circassians in Turkey}}

The number of Circassians in Turkey is between 100 thousand and 2 million. Among the Circassians in Turkey are also the closely related ethnic groups [[Abazins]] (10,000<ref>[http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=abq Ethnologue: Abasinen]</ref>) and [[Abkhaz people|Abkhazians]] (39,000<ref>[http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=abk Ethnologue: Abchasen]</ref>) counted. The Circassians are a Caucasian immigrant people, the vast majority of them have been assimilated and only a small part still dominates one of the [[Circassian languages]]. The Circassians in Turkey are almost exclusively [[Sunni Islam|Sunni]] [[Muslim]]s of [[Hanafi]] [[madh'hab]].

=== Dagestani peoples ===
Dagestani peoples live in villages in the provinces like [[Bal<U+0131>kesir]], [[Tokat]] and also scattered in other parts of the country. Majority among them are [[Lezgins]], [[Avars]] are the second significant ethnic group. [[Kumyks]] are also present.

=== Crimean Tatars ===
The official number of  [[Crimean Tatars]] is 150.000 but the real population can be a few million. They mostly live in [[Eski<U+015F>ehir Province]] <ref>[http://www.iccrimea.org/scholarly/jankowski.html Crimean Tatars and Noghais in Turkey]</ref>

===Georgians===
{{Main|Chveneburi}}

The Georgians in Turkey are mostly [[Sunni Islam|Sunni Muslims]] of [[Hanafi]] ''[[madh'hab]]''. "[[Chveneburi]]" are name of immigrant Georgians but autochthonous Muslim Georgians too use this term. Muslim Georgians form the majority in parts of [[Artvin Province]] east of the [[<U+00C7>oruh River]]. Immigrant Muslim groups of Georgian origins, found scattered in Turkey are known as [[Chveneburi]]. And the smallest Georgian group are [[Georgian Byzantine-Rite Catholics|Catholics]], they lives in [[Istanbul]].

=== Greeks ===
{{Main|Greeks in Turkey}} 
{{Further|Greek genocide}}
The Greeks constitute a population of [[Greeks|Greek]] and [[Greek language|Greek]]-speaking [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox]] [[Christianity|Christians]] who mostly live in [[Istanbul]], including its district [[Princes' Islands]], as well as on the two islands of the western entrance to the [[Dardanelles]]: [[Imbros]] and [[Tenedos]] ({{lang-tr|G<U+00F6>k<U+00E7>eada}} and ''Bozcaada''). 

They are the remnants of the estimated 200,000 Greeks who were permitted under the provisions of the [[Treaty of Lausanne]] to remain in Turkey following the [[Population exchange between Greece and Turkey|1923 population exchange]], which involved the forcible resettlement of approximately 1.5 million Greeks from [[Anatolia]] and [[East Thrace]] and of half a million [[Turkish people|Turks]] from all of Greece except for [[Western Thrace]]. After years of persecution (e.g. the [[Varl<U+0131>k Vergisi]] and the [[Istanbul Pogrom]]), [[emigration]] of [[ethnic Greeks]] from the Istanbul region greatly accelerated, reducing the 119.822

However according to the [[Human Rights Watch]] the Greek population in Turkey is estimated at 2,500 in 2006. The Greek population in Turkey is collapsing as the community is now far too small to sustain itself demographically, due to [[emigration]], much higher death rates than birth rates and continuing discrimination.<ref name="HRW">According to the [[Human Rights Watch]] the Greek population in Turkey is estimated at 2,500 in 2006.

Since 1924, the status of the Greek minority in Turkey has been ambiguous. Beginning in the 1930s, the government instituted repressive policies forcing many Greeks to emigrate. Examples are the [[Labour battalion (Turkey)|labour battalion]]s drafted among non-Muslims during World War I as well as the Fortune Tax ([[Varl<U+0131>k Vergisi]]) levied mostly on non-Muslims during the same period. These resulted in financial ruination and death for many Greeks. The exodus was given greater impetus with the [[Istanbul Pogrom]] of September 1955 which led to thousands of Greeks fleeing the city, eventually reducing the Greek population to about 7,000 by 1978 and to about 2,500 by 2006.

=== Jews ===
{{Main|Jews in Turkey}}
{{Further|Antisemitism in Turkey}}

There have been [[Romaniotes|Jewish communities in Asia Minor]] since at least the 5th century BC and many [[Sephardic Jews|Spanish and Portuguese Jews]] [[Alhambra Decree|expelled from Spain]] were welcomed to the Ottoman Empire (including regions part of modern Turkey) in the late 15th century. Despite [[Aliyah|emigration]] during the 20th century, modern day Turkey continues to have a small Jewish population.

Ethnic [[Kurds]] are the largest minority in Turkey, composing around 18% of the total populace or ca. 14 million people as of 2008.<ref name="CIA World Factbook: Turkey">CIA World Factbook: [https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/tu.html Turkey]</ref> Unlike the Turks, the Kurds speak an [[Indo-European language]]. There are Kurds living all over Turkey, but most live to the east and southeast of the country, from where they originate. 

In the 1930s, Turkish government policy aimed to forcibly assimilate and [[Turkification|Turkify]] local Kurds. Today's presence of Kurds is a testimony that many have resisted these measures. Since 1984, Kurdish resistance movements included both peaceful political activities for basic civil rights for Kurds within Turkey, and violent armed rebellion for a separate Kurdish state.<ref name="Global Security">{{cite web|work=[[GlobalSecurity.org]]|url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/war/kurdistan-turkey.htm |title=Kurdistan-Turkey|accessdate=2007-03-28|date=2007-03-22}}</ref>

=== Lazes ===
{{Main|Laz people}}
Most Lazes today live in Turkey, but the Laz minority group has no official status in Turkey. Their number today is estimated to be around 220.000<ref>[http://www.bianet.org/bianet/kategori/bianet/105059/usaklar-ha-bu-lazcayi-konusmayin-da bianet.org]</ref> Lazes are [[Sunni Muslims]]. Only a minority are bilingual in Turkish and their native [[Laz language]] which belongs to the [[South Caucasian languages|South Caucasian group]]. The number of the Laz speakers is decreasing, and is now limited chiefly to the [[Rize]] and [[Artvin]] areas. The historical term [[Lazistan]] <U+2014> formerly referring to a narrow tract of land along the [[Black Sea]] inhabited by the Laz as well as by several other ethnic groups <U+2014> has been banned from official use and replaced with ''Do<U+011F>u Karadeniz'' (which also includes [[Trabzon]]). During the [[Russo-Turkish War of 1877<U+2013>1878]], the [[Muslim]] population of Russia near the war zones was subjected to ethnic cleansing; many Lazes living in [[Batumi|Batum]] fled to the Ottoman Empire, settling along the southern Black Sea coast to the east of [[Samsun]].

[[Ossetians]] emigrated from [[North Ossetia]] since the second half of the 19th century, end of [[Caucasian War]]. Today, the majority of them live in Ankara and Istanbul. There are 24 Ossetian villages in central and eastern Anatolia. The Ossetians in Turkey are divided into three major groups, depending on their history of immigration and ensuing events: those living in [[Kars]] (Sar<U+0131>kam<U+0131><U+015F>) and [[Erzurum]], those in [[Sivas]], [[Tokat]] and [[Yozgat]] and those in [[Mu<U+015F>]] and [[Bitlis]].<ref>[http://www.worldbulletin.net/author_article_print.php?id=1804]</ref>

=== Christians ===
{{Main|Christianity in Turkey}}
{{Further|Persecution of Christians in Turkey}}

[[Christianity]] has a long history in Anatolia which, nowadays part of the [[Republic of Turkey]]'s territory, was the birthplace of numerous Christian [[Twelve apostles|Apostles]] and [[Saint]]s, such as [[Apostle Paul]] of [[Tarsus (city)|Tarsus]], [[Saint Timothy|Timothy]], [[St. Nicholas]] of [[Myra]], [[St. Polycarp]] of [[Smyrna]] and many others. Two out of the five centers ([[Patriarchate]]s) of the ancient [[Pentarchy]] were located in present-day Turkey: [[Constantinople]] (Istanbul) and [[Antioch]] ([[Antakya]]). All of the [[first seven Ecumenical Councils]] which are recognized by both the Western and Eastern churches were held in present-day Turkey. Of these, the [[Nicene Creed]], declared with the [[First Council of Nicaea]] ([[<U+0130>znik]]) in 325, is of utmost importance and has provided the essential definitions of present-day Christianity.

Today the Christian population of Turkey includes an estimated 45,000 [[Armenian Apostolic Church|Armenian Orthodox]][http://www.todayszaman.com/tz-web/detaylar.do?load=detay&link=161291], 17,000 [[Syriac Orthodox Church|Syriac Orthodox]], 8,000 [[Chaldean Catholic Church|Chaldean Catholic]], 3,000-4,000 [[Greek Orthodox Church|Greek Orthodox]][http://www.todayszaman.com/tz-web/detaylar.do?load=detay&link=161291], and smaller numbers of [[Bulgarian Orthodox Church|Bulgarians]],  [[Georgian Orthodox Church|Georgians]], and [[Protestanism|Protestants]].

==== Orthodox Christians ====

{{Main|Orthodox Christianity in Turkey}}

[[Orthodox Christianity]] forms a tiny minority in Turkey, comprising far less than one tenth of one percent of the entire population. The provinces of [[Istanbul Province|Istanbul]] and [[Hatay Province|Hatay]], which includes Antakya, are the main centres of Turkish Christianity, with comparatively dense Christian populations, though they are very small minorities. The main variant of Christianity present in Turkey is the [[Eastern Orthodox]] branch, focused mainly in the [[Greek Orthodox|Greek Orthodox Church]], however due to their slightly larger numbers the [[Syriac Orthodox Church]] is the most prominent Orthodox Church in the country.

{{Main|Roman Catholicism in Turkey}}
Tarsus Ecclesia Sancti Pauli Apostoli.jpg
The [[Roman Catholic Church]] in Turkey is under the spiritual leadership of the [[Pope]] and [[curia]] in [[Rome]]. There are around 35,000 Catholics,<ref>[http://www.fact-archive.com/encyclopedia/Roman_Catholics_by_country Roman Catholics by country] [[Fact-Archive.com]]</ref> constituting 0.05% of the population. The faithful follow the [[Latin Rite|Latin]], [[Byzantine Rite|Byzantine]], [[Armenian Rite|Armenian]] and [[Chaldean Rite]]. Most Latin Rite Catholics are [[Levantines (Latin Christians)|Levantines]] of mainly [[Italian people|Italian]] or [[French people|French]] background, although a few are ethnic Turks (who are usually converts via marriage to Levantines or other non-Turkish Catholics). Byzantine, Armenian, and Chaldean rite Catholics are generally members of the Greek, Armenian, and Assyrian minority groups respectively. Turkey's Catholics are concentrated in Istanbul.

The Catholic community was shocked when Father [[Andrea Santoro]], an Italian missionary working in Turkey for 10 years, was shot twice at his church near the Black Sea.<ref>{{cite web | author=| date= February 6, 2006| title= Priest's killing shocks Christians in Turkey | format=| work=Catholic World News | url=http://www.cwnews.com/news/viewstory.cfm?recnum=42255 | accessdate=2006-06-26}}</ref> He had written a letter to the Pope asking him to visit Turkey.<ref>{{cite web | author=| date= February 9, 2006| title=Priest Slain in Turkey Had Sought Pope Visit | format=| work=Reuters | url=http://www.nytimes.com/glogin?URI=http://www.nytimes.com/2006/02/09/international/europe/09vatican.html&OQ=_rQ3D1Q26nQ3DTopQ252fReferenceQ252fTimesQ2520TopicsQ252fOrganizationsQ252fRQ252fRomanQ2520CatholicQ2520ChurchQ2520&OP=789afff8Q2FQ3DQ2AdUQ3DcN_PQ27NNibQ3Db77(Q3D7bQ3D7TQ3DQ24aidQ27auiQ24NauxQ3DdSQ27NQ3FdQ3D7TQ5DuiQ24_ua2Q7CiQ51x | accessdate=2006-06-26}}</ref> [[Pope Benedict XVI]] visited Turkey in November 2006.<ref>{{cite web | author=| date= February 9, 2006| title= Confirmed: Pope to visit Turkey in November | format=| work=Catholic World News | url=http://www.cwnews.com/news/viewstory.cfm?recnum=42328 | accessdate=2006-06-26}}</ref> Relations had been rocky since [[Pope Benedict XVI]] had stated his opposition to Turkey joining the [[European Union]].<ref>{{cite web | author=Donovan, Jeffrey | date= April 20, 2005| title= World: New Pope Seen As Maintaining Roman Catholic Doctrinal Continuity | work=Radio Free Europe | url=http://www.rferl.org/featuresarticle/2005/04/b1b15b4e-bf68-4fc8-bd03-c6552f9d067a.html | accessdate=2006-06-26}}</ref> [[The Council of Catholic Bishops]] met with the Turkish prime minister in 2004 to discuss restrictions and difficulties such as property issues.<ref>{{cite web | author=| date= September 15, 2004| title=Turkey | work=International Religious Freedom Report 2004| url=http://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2004/35489.htm | accessdate=2006-06-26}}</ref> More recently, Bishop [[Luigi Padovese]], on June 6, 2010, the Vicar Apostolic of Turkey, was killed.

There have been [[Romaniotes|Jewish communities in Asia Minor]] since at least the 5th century BC and many [[Sephardic Jews|Spanish and Portuguese Jews]] [[Alhambra Decree|expelled from Spain]] were welcomed to the Ottoman Empire (including regions part of modern Turkey) in the late 15th century. Despite [[Aliyah|emigration]] during the 20th century, modern day Turkey continues to have a small Jewish population.

==== Alawites ====
{{Main|Alawites in Turkey}}

The exact number of [[Alawites]]  in Turkey is unknown, but there were 185 000 Alawites in 1970.<ref>{{Cite book | authorlink=  | coauthors= | title=State and rural society in medieval Islam: sultans, muqta<U+02BB>s, and fallahun | year=1997 | publisher=E.J. Brill | location=Leiden  | isbn=90-04-10649-9 | pages=162}}</ref> As [[Muslim]]s, they are not recorded separately from Sunnis in ID registration. In the [[Demographics of Turkey#1965 linguistic census|1965 census]] (the last Turkish census where informants were asked their [[mother tongue]]), 180,000 people in the three provinces declared their mother tongue as [[Arabic language|Arabic]]. However, Arabic-speaking Sunni and Christian people are also included in this figure.

Alawites traditionally speak the same dialect of [[Levantine Arabic]] with [[Syria]]n Alawites. Arabic is best preserved in rural communities and Samanda<U+011F>. Younger people in [[<U+00C7>ukurova]] cities and (to a lesser extent) in <U+0130>skenderun tend to speak Turkish. Turkish spoken by Alawites is distinguished by Alawites and non-Alawites alike with its particular accents and vocabulary. Knowledge of [[Arabic alphabet]] is confined to religious leaders and men who had worked or studied in [[Arab World|Arab countries]].
