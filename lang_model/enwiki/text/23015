'''Wyangala''' {{IPAc-en|<U+02C8>|w|a<U+026A>|<U+00E6>|<U+014B>|g|<U+0251>:|l|<U+0259>}} is a small village in the [[Wyangala#Water resources|Lachlan Valley]], near the junction of the [[Abercrombie River|Abercrombie]] and [[Lachlan River|Lachlan]] Rivers, just below the [[Wyangala Dam]] wall. It is in the [[South West Slopes]] of [[New South Wales]], [[Australia]], and about {{convert|320|km|abbr=on}} west of the state capital, [[Sydney]].

The village was named after a [[Wiradjuri]] word of unknown meaning. The Wiradjuri people were the original inhabitants of the Lachlan Valley, with campsites along river flats, on open land and by rivers. In 1817 [[John Oxley]] and [[George William Evans]] were the first Europeans to explore the valley. White settlement commenced several years later in the 1830s, leading to violent clashes between the native population and the settlers.

The present-day village was established in 1928, during the construction of Wyangala Dam.  However, in the same area, there was a scattered pioneering settlement known as Wyangala Flats, which was established in the 1840s.  This settlement was submerged under water following the completion of Wyangala Dam in 1935. 

Although Wyangala grew substantially during periods of dam construction, population numbers dwindled in the subsequent years. This resulted in the removal of many houses and the closure of most businesses, leaving Wyangala with a small [[Education in Australia|primary school]], a [[Catholic]] church, several sports fields and parks, in addition to some other facilities. There are no buildings of historical note, as the original purpose of the village was to solely provide utilitarian accommodation for the construction workers.

Attractions in the area include Lake Wyangala (used for water-sports and fishing activities), a nine hole golf course, walking and mountain bike trails, and the {{convert|1.5|km|abbr=on}} long dam wall itself. Wyangala has a warm and [[temperate]] climate with a diverse range of native and exotic plants and animals, including a number of threatened and [[endangered species]].  The [[flora]], [[fauna]] and village residents occupy a hilly landscape dominated by [[granite]], with large rock outcrops and boulders throughout the entire area.

==History==

===The Wiradjuri people===
[[File:Windradyne, Aust. Aboriginal warrior from the Wiradjuri.jpg|thumb|left|A Wiradjuri warrior, thought to be [[Windradyne]]]]
The [[Wiradjuri]] people were the original custodians of the region surrounding Wyangala. These skilled hunter-fisher-gatherers wore possum-skin cloaks and lived along river flats, on open ground and by rivers. They were, and still remain,  the largest [[Indigenous Australians|indigenous]] group in New South Wales, with tribal lands encompassing the [[Macquarie River|Macquarie]], the [[Lachlan River|Lachlan]] and the [[Murrumbidgee River|Murrumbidgee]] rivers.<ref>{{cite web |last=Patrick |first=Kathy |author2=Samantha Simmons  |year=1994 |title=Australian Museum's Aboriginal Collections: Wiradjuri |pages=39 |publisher=[[Australian Museum]] }}</ref>

Archaeological investigations have identified over 200 Wiradjuri campsites around Wyangala, suggesting the native population in the area was originally high.<ref>{{Cite book|author=English, A.J. and Gay, L.M.|year=1995|title=Archaeological Survey and Assessment of Aboriginal Sites, Wyangala Catchment, NSW|publisher=Report prepared for Project Steering Committee.}}</ref> Campsites were located on gentle hill slopes, on elevated crests and on [[alluvial]]/[[colluvial]] [[Fluvial terrace|terraces]] near the Lachlan River course.<ref>{{Cite book|author=Jodie Benton, Kim Tuovinen, Emily McCuistion|page=32|year=2013|title=Aboriginal and Historic Heritage Assessment, Kempfield Project|publisher=OzArk Environmental and Heritage Management P/L}}</ref>

The name 'Wyangala' (pronounced {{IPAc-en|<U+02C8>|w|a<U+026A>|<U+00E6>|<U+014B>|g|<U+0251>:|l|<U+0259>}})<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://tom.brondsted.dk/text2phoneme/transcribeit.php|title=Automatic Phonemic Transcriber|publisher=Tom Br<U+00F8>ndsted|accessdate=May 2014}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:IPA_for_English|title=Help:IPA for English|publisher=Wikipedia|accessdate=May 2014}}</ref> originates from a Wiradjuri word of unknown meaning.<ref name=gnb>{{NSW GNR|id=SXlpFxKmMn|title=Wyangala Dam|accessdate=April 2014}}</ref> However, similar sounding words in the Wiradjuri language indicate it may mean troublesome or bad (''wanggun'') white (''ngalar'').<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.salc.org.au/index.php?option=com_wrapper&Itemid=60|title=Sydney Aboriginal Languages and Computing|publisher=Human Services, Aboriginal Affairs, NSW|accessdate=May 2014}}</ref> The village, situated  adjacent the Lachlan River, inherited  this name, as did the original pioneering settlement of Wyangala Flats.

===European settlement===
On 27 May 1815, Deputy Surveyor [[George William Evans]] discovered the headwaters of the Lachlan River, naming it in honour of the NSW Governor, [[Lachlan Macquarie]]. Two years later Lieutenant [[John Oxley]], with Evans by his side, explored the Lachlan from its junction with the [[Belubula River]] to the [[Great Cumbung Swamp]], a distance of {{convert|1450|km|abbr=on}}. As Oxley progressed down the Lachlan, he had several friendly encounters with the native Wiradjuri people, noting that the language they spoke was distinctly different from that used by the indigenous population on the coast.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://ebooks.adelaide.edu.au/o/oxley/john/o95j/part1.html|title=Journals of Two Expeditions into the Interior of New South Wales, by John Oxley|publisher=University of Adelaide|accessdate=May 2014}}</ref> By the time Oxley had reached the Cumbung Swamp, he could advance no further due to the presence of impassable marshland, eventually being forced to abandon the journey and to turn back. Oxley believed he had reached a marshy inland sea, concluding that the interior of Australia was 'uninhabitable' and unfit for settlement.<ref name="National Library of Australia">{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article103025908 |title=Possibilities of the Lachlan Valley. |newspaper=[[The Land (newspaper)|The Land (Sydney, NSW : 1911 - 1954)]] |location=Sydney, NSW |date=25 July 1924 |accessdate=24 April 2014 |page=2 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Oxley|title=John Oxley|publisher=Wikipedia|accessdate=April 2014}}</ref>

Despite Oxley's bleak assessment of the [[Wyangala#Water resources|Lachlan Valley]], European settlement of the area began several years after the expedition. In 1831 Arthur Rankin and James Sloan, both [[cattlemen]] from [[Bathurst, New South Wales|Bathurst]], were the first white settlers to move into the Valley.<ref name="Cowra">{{Cite web|url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/New-South-Wales/Cowra/2005/02/17/1108500193420.html|title=Cowra|publisher=The Sydney Morning Herald|date=8 February 2004}}</ref> Encroachment on traditional Wiradjuri lands resulted in violent clashes between the indigenous population and the settlers. In the midst of this ongoing conflict, new land was made available in the Wyangala area by the colonial government. By the 1840s ''[[occupation licenses]]'' for land at Wyangala Flats were being auctioned from the Bathurst Police Office,<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article12416960 |title=OCCUPATION LICENSES. |newspaper=[[Sydney morning herald|The Sydney Morning Herald (NSW : 1842 - 1954)]] |location=NSW |date=9 February 1844 |accessdate=24 April 2014 |page=4 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}</ref> and by 1860 ''country lots'' at Wyangala were selling from the [[Boorowa]] Police Office for <U+00A3>1 an acre.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article103400762 |title=CROWN LANDS' SALES. |newspaper=[[Goulburn Herald|Goulburn Herald (NSW : 1860 - 1864)]] |location=NSW |date=10 March 1860 |accessdate=24 April 2014 |page=3 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}</ref> At this time and until the construction of the [[Wyangala#1928-1935 Dam construction|1935 dam]], the land at Wyangala was primarily used for wool production.<ref name="Cowra on the Lachlan">{{Cite book|author=Joan Marriott|title=Cowra on the Lachlan. |year=1988 |pages=172<U+2013>191, 235<U+2013>238 |publisher=Cowra Shire Council and Cowra and District Historical Society}}</ref>

The conflict with the Wiradjuri people lessened by the 1850s, as gold mining and [[Selection (Australian history)|free selection]] brought many new settlers to the area. The unrelenting tide of Europeans overwhelmed the indigenous population, resulting in the occupation of traditional lands, the destruction of [[Australian Aboriginal sacred sites|sacred sites]], and perhaps most damaging of all, the introduction of new diseases. This eventually led to the displacement and the decline of the Wiradjuri people.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiradjuri|title=Wiradjuri|publisher=Wikipedia|accessdate=April 2014}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://heritagebathurst.com/history-matters/indigenous-history/|title=The Wiradjuri People|publisher=Bathurst Heritage Matters|accessdate=May 2014}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://willcarterart.com.au/wiradjuri/|title=Wiradjuri|publisher=Will Carter Art|accessdate=May 2014}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.environment.nsw.gov.au/bioregions/SouthWesternSlopes-RegionalHistory.htm|title=South Western Slopes - regional history|publisher=Environment and Heritage, NSW Government|accessdate=May 2014}}</ref>

====Gold====
[[File:Mt-Mcdonald-1.jpg|thumb|left|Mt McDonald, Ca 1900]]
[[Australian gold rushes|Gold mining]] was prevalent in the nearby [[Mount McDonald, New South Wales|Mount McDonald]] area in the late 1800s and early 1900s after [[Quartz reef mining|reef gold]] was discovered in 1880. A number of quartz reefs were discovered by Donald McDonald and his party as they were prospecting the mountain ranges around Wyangala. It was mere chance that McDonald happened upon the gold; he was returning from a fruitless day of prospecting and noticed a faint sparkle at the foot of a tree near his base camp. He stopped and picked up the first quartz specimen containing gold. This eventually led to the discovery of two gold-rich quartz reefs. As news of his discovery spread, miners were drawn to the area and slowly the township of Mount McDonald grew out of the forest.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article5967737 |title=MOUNT MACDONALD GOLDFIELD, NEW SOUTH WALES. |newspaper=[[The Argus (Australia)|The Argus (Melbourne, Vic. : 1848 - 1957)]] |location=Melbourne, Vic. |date=5 October 1881 |accessdate=24 April 2014 |page=10 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}</ref> In its prime, the town had

{{quote|... some 600  persons living there as well as many people in the surrounding district. A school, at least one (Catholic) Church, banks,  a general store... a resident doctor and the inevitable [[pubs]].|Frank Clune (1935) <ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.frankmurray.com.au/?page_id=4667|title=Mount McDonald - Early Days|publisher=Frank Murray|accessdate=March 2014}}</ref>}}

By the late 1920s, as mining declined, the town faded away and is no longer visible.<ref name="Rolling Down the Lachlan">{{Cite book|author=[[Frank Clune]]|title=Rolling Down the Lachlan. |year=1944 |pages=92<U+2013>116 |publisher=Moderne Printing Co.}}</ref>

Although most of the gold mining activity was limited to Mount McDonald, [[alluvia|alluvial gold]] and some precious gems were also found along the banks of the Lachlan River at Wyangala in the early 1900s.  However, the find was not significant enough to see commercial interest.<ref name="Cowra"/><ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article124477634 |title=PRECIOUS STONES. |newspaper=[[Maitland Daily Mercury|The Maitland Daily Mercury (NSW : 1894 - 1939)]] |location=NSW |date=25 May 1923 |accessdate=24 April 2014 |page=3 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}</ref>

====Bushrangers====
[[File:YoungBenHall.jpg|thumb|left|Ben Hall, a notorious bushranger of the Lachlan Valley in the 1800s]]
During the 1860s and 1870s the Lachlan Valley had serious problems with [[Bushrangers]], notably gangs led by [[Frank Gardiner]], [[John Gilbert (bushranger)|John Gilbert]] and [[Ben Hall (bushranger)|Ben Hall]], amongst others.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nma.gov.au/exhibitions/irish_in_australia/bushrangers |title=Bushrangers|accessdate=April 2014|publisher=[[National Museum of Australia]]}}</ref> Frank Gardiner was one of the most successful bushrangers of the time. His final robbery, which also was to be his greatest haul, occurred in 1862 at Eugowra Rocks.  In this instance, Gardiner along with Ben Hall, John Gilbert and some others, robbed a 'gold escort' carrying in the range of <U+20A4>14,000-<U+20A4>22,000 in gold and cash.<ref name="Rolling Down the Lachlan"/><ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article117778541 |title=EUGOWRA GOLD ESCORT ROBBERY. |newspaper=[[Grenfell Record and Bland Advertiser|The Grenfell Record and Lachlan District Advertiser (NSW : 1876 - 1951)]] |location=NSW |date=11 June 1942 |accessdate=12 May 2014 |page=1 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}</ref> It was rumored that Gardiner convinced some of the gang members to bury their share of the gold in a mountain cave near Wyangala.

{{quote| Somewhere on a rock-strewn mountain near the Fish River that empties into the Wyangala Dam, a fortune in stolen gold lies hidden.|G.R. (1942) <ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article72004391 |title=FRANK GARDINER. |newspaper=[[The Capricornian|The Capricornian (Rockhampton, Qld. : 1875 - 1929)]] |location=Rockhampton, Qld. |date=14 October 1905 |accessdate=30 May 2014 |page=27 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}</ref>}}

Gardiner was to give the gang members a signal when it was safe to recover the gold. This was never to happen, as Gardiner was eventually exiled to the United States after spending several years in prison. Five years after the heist, an Irishman arrived in New South Wales with a rough map marking the location of the gold, purportedly drawn by Gardiner.  Even with this map and years of searching, no trace of the gold was ever found.

By the late 1800s improved police efficiency was bringing to a close the era of the bushranger, many of whom had been [[gaol]]ed, exiled, shot or hung. This decline in criminal activity coincided with a general push to populate the region, the introduction of telegraph communications, and the development of transport infrastructure.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bushrangers|title=Bushrangers|publisher=Wikipedia|accessdate=April 2014}}</ref>

===20th century===

====Water conservation====
Development in the region was substantial by the early 1900s, although it was restricted by variable and uncertain river flows.<ref name="auspostalhistory.com">{{Cite web|url=http://www.auspostalhistory.com/articles/1510.php|title=Wyangala Dam Constructed on the Lachlan River|publisher=Australian Postal History and Social Philately|accessdate=March 2014}}</ref> In 1902 the Legislative Assembly of New South Wales recognised the need for [[water conservation]]. Recurrent [[Drought in Australia|droughts]] and their associated effects on waterways, were impacting production and causing significant livestock deaths. The Assembly considered a number of options to address the problem, including a proposal to build a [[reservoir]] at Wyangala. Previous surveys of the Lachlan Valley had identified Wyangala as being the only suitable location for a large water storage.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article24748029 |title=WATER CONSERVATION. |newspaper=[[Perth Gazette|The West Australian (Perth, WA : 1879 - 1954)]] |location=Perth, WA |date=20 June 1902 |accessdate=24 April 2014 |page=5 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article113412141 |title=PRIVATE IRRIGATION. |newspaper=[[Empire (newspaper)|Evening News (Sydney, NSW : 1869 - 1931)]] |location=Sydney, NSW |date=6 May 1903 |accessdate=24 April 2014 |page=4 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}</ref> These early discussions eventually led to the construction of the 1935 dam and the beginnings of present-day Wyangala village.

{{quote|... Wyangala failed to hold the surging floodwaters of the devastating 1952 deluge, which was greater than any water mass it had been designed to withstand.|Joan Marriott (1988) <ref name="Cowra on the Lachlan"/>}}

Due to concerns about the original dam capacity to withstand [[flood]]s and a projected increase in demand for water by the agricultural industry in the region, Wyangala Dam was upgraded and enlarged from 1961 to 1971.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wyangala_Dam|title=Wyangala Dam|publisher=Wikipedia|accessdate=March 2014}}</ref> With post-war immigration at its height,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-war_immigration_to_Australia|title=Post-war immigration to Australia|publisher=Wikipedia|accessdate=April 2014}}</ref> the Wyangala population swelled with a multinational workforce.

In the post-telegraph era, a [[Telephone exchange|manual telephone exchange]] was also located within the post office.  The postmaster/mistress would run the telephone exchange in conjunction with running the post office. The telephone exchange was automated in the late 1980s and the post office itself was closed in 1998.<ref>{{cite book |author=Vicki Scott|title=Recollections of a Wyangala Dam Post Office Postmistress|year=2014}}</ref>

[[Postmasters]]/mistresses from the 1970s until closure, included:

=====Wyangala Dam [[Public and private education in Australia|Public School]]=====
Wyangala Dam Public School was established in 1929 (at the time the district's second school). Its primary purpose was to cater for the children of the Dam construction workers. It has been located at three sites since establishment.  The first was near the present-day bowling club, and then near the Vic Roworth Conference Center, and finally during the 1960s, it was moved to its current location (see [[Wyangala#Community|Community section]]). Notably, there was an earlier school at Wyangala, which was established 22 years prior.  This school ran for six years and closed in 1913.<ref name="Cowra on the Lachlan"/>

The number of children attending the school has varied widely over the years, ranging from 70+ in 1930, to 160 in the 1960s, to 20+ in the early 1980s, to under 10 in the 2000s.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article133392522 |title=WYANGALA DAM. |newspaper=[[The Newcastle Herald|Newcastle Morning Herald and Miners' Advocate (NSW : 1876 - 1954)]] |location=NSW |date=7 January 1930 |accessdate=8 August 2014 |page=4 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}</ref> Teachers in charge since establishment included:<ref name="Cowra on the Lachlan"/>

=====Church=====
The first church in Wyangala was a small timber and corrugated iron building, built during the construction of the 1935 dam. It was located near the present-day country club, opposite the bowling green ([[Wyangala#Sport|see Sport section]]). After the dam was completed, the church was purchased by Mr Bert Priddle and transported to a property near [[Grenfell, New South Wales|Grenfell]], where it was re-erected and licensed as an Anglican place of worship on the 17th of November 1935, eventually becoming consecrated by Bishop Wylde on the 19th of August 1953.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://web.archive.org/web/20140922070102/http://www.bathurstanglican.org.au/LiteratureRetrieve.aspx?ID=75355&A=SearchResult&SearchID=7695087&ObjectID=75355&ObjectType=6|title=Anglican News: Reporting for the Church in Western New South Wales|publisher=Bathurst Anglican Diocese|format=PDF|accessdate=September 2014}}</ref>

The current church, St Vincent's, was built at the center of the village under the direction of Aub Murray, with interdenominational help. It is of [[cinder block]] construction, with an iron roof. The church was officially opened on 19 November 1954. The day after the opening, as preparations were being made for the first mass, a storm knocked down the rear wall of the church.  Rebuilding the wall delayed the first mass until 5 December 1954.<ref>{{Cite book |authors=John Cooke and Bernie Sheehy|title=Wyangala Dam Church|year=2014}}</ref>

====Murder====
The only recorded case of a suspected murder in Wyangala village occurred in July 1935, when the [[coroner]], Mr H. D. Pulling found the death of Mr John Neilson, a worker at the dam, was caused by a bullet wound to the head. The suspects were named as Mrs Mavis Neilsen (the victim's wife) and Mr Claude Charnock (a family friend).  Both suspects claimed the shooting was accidental and self-inflicted.  However, evidence from the [[post mortem]], conducted by Dr Mahon of Cowra, and that of another witness, indicated the wound could not be self-inflicted.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article17180643 |title=WYANGALA. |newspaper=[[Sydney morning herald|The Sydney Morning Herald (NSW : 1842 - 1954)]] |location=NSW |date=9 July 1935 |accessdate=24 April 2014 |page=11 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}</ref>

The suspects were charged and brought to trial in September 1935, the [[Crown Prosecutor (Australia)|Crown]] alleging that they conspired together to kill Mr John Neilson.  A few hours into the trial, before the prosecution could complete their case, there was a dramatic turn of events when the jury intimated it did not wish to hear anymore, as there was 'insufficient evidence to warrant a conviction'. The prosecutor appealed to the jury to wait to hear more witness and police testimony. However, after taking a few seconds to consider the request, all jury members agreed there was no point continuing. Consequently, the judge acquitted both the accused and allowed them to go free.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article86543577 |title=MURDER CHARGE FAILS. |newspaper=[[Advocate|Advocate (Burnie, Tas. : 1890 - 1954)]] |location=Burnie, Tas. |date=3 September 1935 |accessdate=24 April 2014 |page=7 Edition: DAILY |publisher=National Library of Australia}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article81259566 |title=UNEXPECTED ENDING. |newspaper=[[The Northern Miner|The Northern Miner (Charters Towers, Qld. : 1874 - 1954)]] |location=Charters Towers, Qld. |date=3 September 1935 |accessdate=24 April 2014 |page=3 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article103381620 |title=ACQUITTED. |newspaper=[[Goulburn Evening Penny Post|Goulburn Evening Penny Post (NSW : 1881 - 1940)]] |location=NSW |date=3 September 1935 |accessdate=24 April 2014 |page=1 Edition: DAILY |publisher=National Library of Australia}}</ref>

===Earthquake===
In October 2006 a [[Richter magnitude scale|magnitude 4 earthquake]] was felt throughout the New South Wales [[Central West (New South Wales)|Central West]], with the epicenter at Wyangala.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2006-10-21/quake-hits-central-west-nsw/1291502|title=Quake hits central west NSW|publisher=ABC News|date=21 October 2006|accessdate=June 2014}}</ref> An earthquake of this magnitude is classified as ''Light'' on the Richter scale and usually results in noticeable shaking of indoor objects and rattling noises.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richter_magnitude_scale|title=Richter magnitude scale|publisher=Wikipedia|accessdate=April 2014}}</ref> [[new south wales|NSW]] [http://www.statewater.com.au/ State Water Corporation] examined Wyangala Dam to see if there was any damage, but found none, with pressure and seepage gauges showing no impact from the earthquake.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2006-10-23/recent-quakes-not-too-far-outside-the-norm/1291848|title=Recent quakes not 'too far outside the norm'|publisher=ABC News||date=23 October 2006|accessdate=June 2014}}</ref> In addition, no damage or injuries were reported within the village or the State Park.

===Dam wall road closure===
[[File:Wyangalaspillway.jpg|thumb|Wyangala Dam spillway with road running along the top]]
In 2009 NSW State Water Corporation announced plans to permanently close public road access over Wyangala Dam wall, because of the introduction of 'tough new security measures' and to comply with occupational health and safety requirements. This new policy was to coincide with a significant upgrade and increase in height of the Dam wall.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2009-03-17/concerns-aired-over-dam-road-closure/1621314|title=Concerns aired over dam road closure|publisher=ABC News||date=17 March 2009|accessdate=June 2014}}</ref> State Water proposed that alternative access be provided to Wyangala via Mt McDonald Road (now [[Reg Hailstone]] Way).<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2009-03-10/road-across-wyangala-dam-wall-to-close/1613662|title=Road across Wyangala Dam wall to close|publisher=ABC News||date=10 March 2009|accessdate=June 2014}}</ref> This announcement angered many locals, as they believed the implications of such a change had not been considered. Concerns included:
 
*Access to Wyangala Dam Public School, where some children would need to travel {{convert|60|km|abbr=on}} to get to school and back, instead of having a {{convert|5|km|abbr=on}} journey, 
*Some local workers on the 'wrong' side of the Dam wall not being able to make the long detour via Mt McDonald Rd,
*The dangers of the narrow curves and bends on Mt McDonald road,
*Access time and ease of access for emergency services vehicles to Wyangala,
*The possible decline in patronage of Wyangala Waters State Park and Wyangala Country Club (it is estimated over 75% of visitors enter Wyangala via the Dam wall road).<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2009-03-24/meeting-to-debate-wyangala-road-closure-plan/1628610|title=Meeting to debate Wyangala road closure plan|publisher=ABC News|date=24 March 2009|accessdate=June 2014}}</ref>

The concerns voiced by local citizens, emergency services and local councils resulted in a review of the decision to reroute traffic through Mt McDonald road.  Subsequently, a report prepared by [[Ian Armstrong (politician)|Ian Armstrong]] recommended that a bridge be built across the [[Lachlan River]], downstream of the village to give alternate access to Wyangala.  This recommendation was accepted by most locals as the only viable option, even though there was some dissent from some people affected by the new road and bridge.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2010-03-19/doubt-cast-over-dam-road-upgrades/370886|title=Doubt cast over dam road upgrades|publisher=ABC News||date=19 March 2010|accessdate=June 2014}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2011-05-18/wyangala-access-route-bringing-opportunities/2717656|title=Wyangala access route bringing opportunities|publisher=ABC News||date=18 May 2011|accessdate=June 2014}}</ref>

In June 2014, the bridge (Wyangala Bridge) and new road (Trout Farm Road) were completed. As a result, vehicle access across the top of Wyangala Dam wall was closed.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.cowraguardian.com.au/story/2372004/gallery-two-residents-are-concerned-with-wyangalas-trout-farm-road-upgrade/|title=Two residents are concerned with Wyangala's Trout Farm Road upgrade |publisher=Cowra Guardian||date=24 June 2014|accessdate=June 2014}}</ref>

===Removal of waterslides===
At the beginning of 2013 Wyangala Waters State Park advertised for expressions of interest to remove the Waterslides from within the Park. The slides had not been in use for a number of years due to problems of Park management finding a suitable operator. This unexpected announcement by the Park resulted in an extensive campaign to save the slides.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.cowraguardian.com.au/story/1308806/campaign-begins-to-save-wyangalas-water-slides/|title=Campaign begins to save Wyangala's water slides|publisher=Cowra Guardian||date=18 February 2013|accessdate=June 2014}}</ref>

Following the public outcry, the former NSW Deputy Premier, [[Andrew Stoner]], put on hold any plans to remove the slides, and moving forward, to appoint a group to review the slides future.  This decision was welcomed by locals and the shire mayor, Bill West, who considered the slides "a significant tourist attraction and popular part of [[Cowra Shire]]".<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2013-02-28/wyangala-waterslides/4544340|title=State back down from Wyangala waterslides' removal|publisher=ABC News||date=28 February 2013|accessdate=June 2014}}</ref>
