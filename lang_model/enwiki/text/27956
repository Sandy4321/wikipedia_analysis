{{for|the 2015 Ladies edition|2015 Ladies Tour of Qatar}}

The '''2015 Tour of Qatar''' was the 14th edition of the [[Tour of Qatar]] cycling stage race. It was organised by the [[Amaury Sport Organisation]] (ASO), the organisers of the [[Tour de France]]. The race was rated as a [[2.HC]] event, the second highest rating an event can receive, and was part of the [[2015 UCI Asia Tour]].

The 2015 race consisted of six stages. It started in [[Dukhan]] on 8 February 2015 and finished on 13 February in [[Doha]], the capital city of [[Qatar]]. The Tour of Qatar puts unusual demands on riders: it has no significant climbs, but almost every stage is affected by strong [[crosswind]]s. These conditions make the race ideal preparation for the [[Classic_cycle_races#Spring_classics|spring classics]] season, so many prominent classics riders were present. The flat stages, suitable for sprinters, and [[individual time trial]] meant that specialists in these disciplines also chose to ride in Qatar.

The race was won by [[Netherlands|Dutch]] rider [[Niki Terpstra]] of {{ct|OPQ|2015}}. It was the second successive year that Terpstra won the race after his victory in [[2014 Tour of Qatar|2014]] and the fourth successive victory for {{ct|OPQ|2015|nolink=yes}}. It was the eighth victory for the team in Qatar. Terpstra took the lead of the race with victory in the third stage of the race, the individual time trial, and held the lead of the race to the finish. [[Maciej Bodnar]] ({{ct|TTS|2015}}) took second place, six seconds behind Terpstra; [[Alexander Kristoff]] won stages 2, 4 and 5 on the way to finishing third, nine seconds off the overall lead.

In the race's other classifications, Kristoff won the silver jersey of the points classification, thanks to his three stage wins. [[Peter Sagan]] ({{ct|TTS|2015}}) was the winner of the pearl white jersey of the young riders classification as he was the highest placed rider born after 1 January 1990. The team classification was won by {{ct|OPQ|2015|nolink=yes}}.

The Tour of Qatar is one of the early races in the season, coming in the middle of three races in the Middle East (alongside the [[2015 Dubai Tour|Dubai Tour]] and the [[2015 Tour of Oman|Tour of Oman]]) that see high levels of participation from the top European teams.<ref name=cyclingnews-preview>{{cite web|last1=Benson|first1=Daniel|title=Tour of Qatar: Etixx-QuickStep look to continue domination|url=http://www.cyclingnews.com/races/tour-of-qatar-2015/preview|website=[[Cyclingnews.com]]|accessdate=12 February 2015}}</ref> The race is particularly popular as a preparation race for riders aiming for the [[Classic_cycle_races#Spring_classics|spring classics]].<ref name=skysports-preview>{{cite web|last1=Westby|first1=Matt|title=Tour of Qatar 2015 preview: Sir Bradley Wiggins, Tom Boonen and Niki Terpstra among favourites for victory|url=http://www1.skysports.com/cycling/news/12040/9703278/tour-of-qatar-2015-preview-sir-bradley-wiggins-tom-boonen-and-niki-terpstra-among-favourites-for-victory|website=[[Skysports.com]]|accessdate=12 February 2015}}</ref> The significant challenge in the Tour of Qatar is the strong winds across the desert, which frequently cause the peloton to split into echelons.

[[Marcel Kittel]] ({{ct|GIA|2015}}) was the most prominent sprinter to travel to Qatar, alongside [[Peter Sagan]] ({{ct|TTS|2015}}), [[Alexander Kristoff]] ({{ct|KAT|2015}}), and several others.<ref name=cyclingnews-preview/>

=== Stage 1 ===

[[File:Tour du Qatar 2015 (A1).jpg|thumbnail|right|Stage 1 route]]

The race began with a {{convert|136|km|0|abbr=on}} route from [[Dukhan]] in the west of Qatar to the Sealine Beach Resort, [[Mesaieed]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Tour of Qatar 2015 - Stage 1|url=http://www.procyclingstats.com/race/Tour_of_Qatar_2015_Stage_1_Sealine_Beach-stages|website=ProCyclingStats|accessdate=10 February 2015}}</ref> The route was flat and, as normal in the Tour of Qatar, the principal difficulty was caused by [[crosswind]]s.<ref name=cyclingnews-s1-results>{{cite web|title=Tour of Qatar 2015: Stage 1 Results|url=http://www.cyclingnews.com/races/tour-of-qatar-2015/stage-1/results|website=Cyclingnews.com|accessdate=10 February 2015}}</ref>

They built a lead that reached seven minutes by the half-way point. Midway through the stage, a change in direction meant the peloton was now racing in crosswinds, and {{ct|OPQ|2015}} along with {{ct|TFR|2015}} attacked. They formed [[Glossary_of_cycling#echelon|echelons]] and split the peloton. Riders such as [[Bradley Wiggins]] ({{ct|SKY|2015}}), [[Nacer Bouhanni]] ({{ct|COF|2015}}) and [[Alejandro Valverde]] ({{ct|MOV|2015}}) were left adrift from the front group, but another turn into a headwind meant the groups could come back together.<ref name="cyclingnews-s1-results"/>

Shortly before the second intermediate sprint, [[Tom Boonen]] ({{ct|OPQ|2015|nolink=yes}}) and [[Peter Sagan]] ({{ct|TTS|2015}}) were involved in a crash, but were both able to remount and rejoin the peloton.<ref name=cyclingnews-s1-boonencrash>{{cite web|title=Boonen and Sagan crash mid-race in Tour of Qatar opener|url=http://www.cyclingnews.com/news/boonen-and-sagan-crash-mid-race-in-tour-of-qatar-opener|last1=Benson|first1=Daniel|website=Cyclingnews.com|accessdate=10 February 2015}}</ref> After [[Nikias Arndt]] ({{ct|GIA|2015}}) won that sprint, [[Greg Van Avermaet]] made a short-lived attack before a more determined effort from [[Lars Boom]] and [[Lieuwe Westra]] (both {{ct|AST|2015}}) and [[Matti Breschel]] ({{ct|TTS|2015}}).<ref name="cyclingnews-s1-results"/> Though they achieved a lead of nearly a minute, the attack was ultimately unsuccessful, due to crosswinds and a combination of {{ct|OPQ|2015|nolink=yes}}, {{ct|TFR|2015|nolink=yes}} and {{ct|TNE|2015}} riding at a high tempo.<ref name="cyclingnews-s1-results"/><ref name=velonews-s1>{{cite web|title=Jose Joaquin Rojas wins opener at 2015 Tour of Qatar|url=http://velonews.competitor.com/2015/02/news/jose-joaquin-rojas-wins-opener-2015-tour-qatar_360361|website=Velonews.com|accessdate=10 February 2015}}</ref>

In the final {{convert|10|km|0|abbr=on}}, the peloton split again. The main field was reduced to 51 riders, with [[Marcel Kittel]] ({{ct|GIA|2015|nolink=yes}}), Wiggins, [[Edvald Boasson Hagen]] ({{ct|MTN|2015}}), [[Luca Paolini]] ({{ct|KAT|2015}}) and [[Filippo Pozzato]] ({{ct|LAM|2015}}) among the notable riders to lose time.<ref name="cyclingnews-s1-results"/><ref name=pcs-s1-result>{{cite web|title=Tour of Qatar 2015 - Stage 1|url=http://www.procyclingstats.com/race/Tour_of_Qatar_2015_Stage_1_Sealine_Beach|website=ProCyclingStats|accessdate=10 February 2015}}</ref>

In the final kilometre, [[Jos<U+00E9> Joaqu<U+00ED>n Rojas]] ({{ct|MOV|2015|nolink=yes}}) attached himself to the back of the {{ct|OPQ|2015|nolink=yes}} leadout train.

=== Stage 2 ===

[[File:Tour du Qatar 2015 (A2).jpg|thumbnail|right|Stage 2 route]]

The second stage took the riders {{convert|187.5|km|0|abbr=on}} from [[Al Wakra]], south of [[Doha]], to [[Al Khor]] Corniche.<ref name=pcs-s2-profile>{{cite web|title=Tour of Qatar 2015 - Stage 2|url=http://www.procyclingstats.com/race/Tour_of_Qatar_2015_Stage_2_Al_Khor_Corniche-profiles|website=ProCyclingStats|accessdate=10 February 2015}}</ref>

Early in the stage, {{ct|OPQ|2015}} launched an attack, quickly splitting the pack in crosswinds to create a lead group of 30 riders.<ref name=cyclingnews-s2-warfare>{{cite web|last1=Benson|first1=Daniel|title=Etixx-QuickStep launch desert warfare in Qatar but Kristoff wins battle|url=http://www.cyclingnews.com/news/etixx-quickstep-launch-desert-warfare-in-qatar-but-kristoff-wins-battle|website=Cyclingnews.com|accessdate=10 February 2015}}</ref> Riders left behind included the race leader, [[Jos<U+00E9> Joaqu<U+00ED>n Rojas]] ({{ct|MOV|2015}}), [[Bradley Wiggins]] ({{ct|SKY|2015}}), [[Marcel Kittel]] ({{ct|GIA|2015}}) and [[Lars Boom]] ({{ct|AST|2015}}). The lead group, however, failed to establish a lead of more than half a minute and work from {{ct|BMC|2015}} and {{ct|MTN|2015}} brought the field back together after {{convert|60|km|0|abbr=on}}, when the wind changed to a tailwind.<ref name=cyclingnews-s1-result>{{cite web|last1=Benson|first1=Daniel|title=Kristoff wins stage 2 at the Tour of Qatar|url=http://www.cyclingnews.com/races/tour-of-qatar-2015/stage-2/results|website=Cyclingnews.com|accessdate=10 February 2015}}</ref><ref name=velonews-s2-result>{{cite web|title=Kristoff rides into Tour of Qatar lead with stage 2 win|url=http://velonews.competitor.com/2015/02/news/road/kristoff-rides-tour-qatar-lead-stage-2-win_360390|website=VeloNews.com|accessdate=10 February 2015}}</ref>

At this point a five-man breakaway formed, including [[Michael M<U+00F8>rk<U+00F8>v]] ({{ct|TTS|2015}}), [[Greg Van Avermaet]] ({{ct|BMC|2015|nolink=yes}}), [[Johann Van Zyl]] ({{ct|MTN|2015|nolink=yes}}), [[Jelle Wallays]] ({{ct|TSV|2015}}), and [[Mathew Hayman]] ({{ct|OGE|2015}}), establishing a lead of nearly four minutes.<ref name=velonews-s2-result/>

[[File:Alexander Kristoff.JPG|160px|thumbnail|left|[[Alexander Kristoff]] (pictured here in 2009) won stages 2, 4 and 5]] At the next change of direction, {{ct|OPQ|2015|nolink=yes}} again attacked in the crosswinds. The breakaway was caught after {{convert|124|km|0|abbr=on}}, with the peloton again splitting. Wiggins, Kittel and [[Fabian Cancellara]] ({{ct|TFR|2015}}) had all been dropped. Soon afterwards, further attacks from {{ct|OPQ|2015|nolink=yes}} removed Rojas and [[Arnaud D<U+00E9>mare]] ({{ct|FDJ|2015}}) from the leading group.<ref name=cyclingnews-s1-result/> Tom Boonen won the second intermediate sprint, earning three bonus seconds.<ref name=cyclingnews-s2-warfare/>

With {{convert|5|km|0|abbr=on}} remaining, the leading group was reduced to 15 riders.<ref name=cyclingnews-s2-warfare/> In the final kilometre, [[Andrea Guardini]] and [[Niki Terpstra]] had formed a small gap, but [[Alexander Kristoff]] bridged up to the pair and launched his sprint with {{convert|500|m|0|abbr=on}} remaining. Kristoff was able to win the stage ahead of Guardini, with Van Avermaet in third.<ref name=cyclingnews-s1-result/>

Due to the 10-second time bonus for winning the stage, Kristoff took over the overall lead of the race, one second ahead of Boonen, who moved into the lead of the points competition. Several riders who had been contenders for the overall victory, including Wiggins and Cancellara, finished over nine minutes behind Kristoff, eliminating them from contention for overall victory.<ref name=cyclingnews-s1-result/><ref>{{cite web|last1=Benson|first1=Daniel|title=Cancellara: Tour of Qatar is a special race|url=http://www.cyclingnews.com/news/cancellara-tour-of-qatar-is-a-special-race|website=Cyclingnews.com|accessdate=10 February 2015}}</ref>

=== Stage 3 ===

[[File:Tour du Qatar 2015 (A3).jpg|thumbnail|right|Stage 3 route]]

The third stage of the race was a {{convert|10.9|km|0|abbr=on}} [[individual time trial]] at [[Lusail]]. The course followed a route that went past the [[Lusail Iconic Stadium]], [[Lusail Sports Arena]] and [[Lusail International Circuit]].<ref name=pcs-s4-route>{{cite web|title=Tour of Qatar 2015 - Stage 4|url=http://www.procyclingstats.com/race/Tour_of_Qatar_2015_Stage_3_Lusail-profiles|website=ProCyclingStats|accessdate=10 February 2015}}</ref> [[File:Luke Rowe CHB 2013 (Extra Cropped).jpg|160px|thumbnail|left|[[Luke Rowe]] (pictured here in 2013) moved into the lead of the young riders competition after stage 3]]  The riders were not allowed to use [[time trial bicycle]]s as would normally be allowed in an individual time trial; conventional [[road bicycle]]s were to be used instead.<ref name=cyclingnews-s3-gallery>{{cite web|title=Gallery: On the start line at the Tour of Qatar|url=http://www.cyclingnews.com/news/gallery-on-the-start-line-at-the-tour-of-qatar|website=Cyclingnews.com|accessdate=10 February 2015}}</ref>

Favourites for the stage victory included [[UCI Road World Championships <U+2013> Men's time trial|current world champion]] [[Bradley Wiggins]] ({{ct|SKY|2015}}), four-time world champion [[Fabian Cancellara]] ({{ct|TFR|2015}}), [[Matthias Br<U+00E4>ndle]] ({{ct|IAM|2015}}) and [[Niki Terpstra]] ({{ct|OPQ|2015}}).<ref name=cyclingnews-s3-gallery/> Wiggins was wearing the [[rainbow jersey]] of the world time-trial champion in a race for the first time and was riding a road bike with modifications for better aerodynamics.<ref>{{cite web|title=Niki Terpstra upstages Bradley Wiggins and Fabian Cancellara in Tour of Qatar third stage|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-02-11/terpstra-upstages-cancellera-wiggins-in-tour-of-qatar/6084898|website=[[Australian Broadcasting Corporation|ABC]]|accessdate=10 February 2015}}</ref><ref name=cyclingnews-s3-gallery/>

The first fast time was set by Lars Boom, who took 14' 33" to complete the course, before Matthias Br<U+00E4>ndle took over the lead with a time of 14' 22". Wiggins briefly took the lead with a time of 14' 13", but soon afterwards Cancellara went one second faster. Terpstra, however, rode eight seconds quicker to win the stage and take over the gold jersey of overall leader.<ref>{{cite web|title=Niki Terpstra takes ITT win and gold jersey in Tour of Qatar stage 3|url=http://velonews.competitor.com/2015/02/news/road/niki-terpstra-takes-itt-win-gold-jersey-tour-qatars-third-stage_360507|website=VeloNews|accessdate=10 February 2015}}</ref><ref name=cyclingnews-s3-result>{{cite web|last1=Farrand|first1=Stephen|title=Terpstra nets double victory in Tour of Qatar time trial|url=http://www.cyclingnews.com/races/tour-of-qatar-2015/stage-3/results|website=Cyclingnews.com|accessdate=10 February 2015}}</ref>

The race leader after stage 2, [[Alexander Kristoff]], finished 44 seconds behind Terpstra, 36 seconds off the overall lead. Other riders to lose significant time were [[Tom Boonen]] and [[Peter Sagan]].

=== Stage 4 ===

[[File:Tour du Qatar 2015 (A4).jpg|thumbnail|right|Stage 4 route]]

The fourth stage of the race was a {{convert|165.5|km|0|abbr=on}} route from [[Al Thakhira]] to the city of [[Mesaieed#Industrial_city|Mesaieed]].<ref name=pcs-s4-route>{{cite web|title=Tour of Qatar 2015 - Stage 4|url=www.procyclingstats.com/race/Tour_of_Qatar_2015_Stage_4_Mesaieed-profiles|website=ProCyclingStats|accessdate=11 February 2015}}</ref> With the wind generally coming from the south, the riders were riding into a headwind most of the day.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.letour.com/tour-of-qatar/2015/us/stage-4/news/flm/kristoff-doubles-in-mesaieed.html|website=letour.com|publisher=Amaury Sports Organisation|accessdate=11 February 2015|title=Kristoff doubles in Mesaieed}}</ref>

Due to the strong winds, the stage started 40 minutes before the scheduled time, as the race organisers were worried about the possibility of sandstorms and of slow racing leading to a late finish. Despite the headwind, three riders formed a breakaway. They were [[Jaco Venter]] ({{ct|MTN|2015}}), [[Dimitry Gruzdev]] ({{ct|AST|2015}}), and [[Jarl Salomein]] ({{ct|TSV|2015}}). The three riders built a lead that reached nearly four minutes.<ref name=velonews-s4-report>{{cite web|title=Kristoff grabs another Qatar stage win, Terpstra stays in front|url=http://velonews.competitor.com/2015/02/news/road/kristoff-grabs-another-qatar-stage-win-terpstra-stays-front_360629|website=Velonews|accessdate=11 February 2015}}</ref><ref name=cyclingnews-s4-result>{{cite web|last1=Farrand|first1=Stephen|title=Kristoff strikes again in Mesaieed|url=http://www.cyclingnews.com/races/tour-of-qatar-2015/stage-4/results|website=Cyclingnews.com|accessdate=11 February 2015}}</ref>

{{ct|OPQ|2015}}, riding for race leader Niki Terpstra,  controlled the breakaway through most of the day. They were supported towards the end of the race by {{ct|FDJ|2015}}.<ref name=cyclingnews-s4-result/> Unlike the earlier road stages, the lack of crosswinds meant that there were no echelons or significant splits in the peloton.<ref name=cyclingnews-s4-kristoff>{{cite web|last1=Benson|first1=Daniel|title=Kristoff enjoys best ever start to a season in Tour of Qatar|url=http://www.cyclingnews.com/news/kristoff-enjoys-best-ever-start-to-a-season-in-tour-of-qatar|website=Cyclingnews.com|accessdate=11 February 2015}}</ref> The breakaway was caught with {{convert|19|km|0|abbr=on}} remaining.<ref name=velonews-s4-report/>

[[File:Peter Sagan - UPCC 2013.jpg|thumbnail|160px|left|[[Peter Sagan]] (pictured here in 2013) was second in two stages and won the youth classification]]In the final kilometres of the stage, several teams tried to ride at the front, including {{Ct|MTN|2015|nolink=yes}}, {{ct|MOV|2015}}, {{ct|FDJ|2015|nolink=yes}}, {{ct|TTS|2015}} and {{ct|OGE|2015}}.<ref name=cyclingnews-s4-result/><ref name=cyclingnews-s4-kristoff/> The strong pace caused several riders to crash, including [[Lars Boom]] ({{ct|AST|2015}}), [[Theo Bos]] ({{ct|MTN|2015|nolink=yes}}) and [[Bradley Wiggins]] ({{ct|SKY|2015}}). All were unhurt and able to finish the stage.<ref name=cyclingnews-s4-result/>

Despite the presence of [[Marcel Kittel]], the team's principal sprinter, {{ct|GIA|2015}} were riding in support of [[Nikias Arndt]]. Kittel took a turn in his lead-out train; since he was in poor form following a period of illness, he had requested the team support Arndt instead.<ref name=velonews-s4-kittel>{{cite web|last1=Brown|first1=Gregor|title=Kittel without sprint kick|url=http://velonews.competitor.com/2015/02/news/kittel-without-sprint-kick_360635|website=Velonews.com|accessdate=11 February 2015}}</ref>

In the final kilometre, the Katusha team moved to the front before Kristoff again started his sprint early; again, the other sprinters were unable to catch him and he crossed the finish line first.<ref name=cyclingnews-s4-result/> He was only slightly ahead of [[Peter Sagan]] ({{ct|TTS|2015|nolink=yes}}), who was so close at the finish line that Kristoff was unsure whether he had won.<ref name=cyclingnews-s4-kristoff/> Arndt was third after {{ct|GIA|2015|nolink=yes}} had done excellent work in the last kilometre.<ref name=cw-s4>{{cite web|last1=Stephen|first1=Puddicombe|title=Alexander Kristoff wins Tour of Qatar stage four|url=http://www.cyclingweekly.co.uk/racing/alexander-kristoff-wins-stage-four-tour-of-qatar-157022|website=Cycling Weekly|accessdate=11 February 2015}}</ref>

There was a small split in the peloton at the end of the race. Several riders lost five seconds, including Terpstra, [[Ian Stannard]] ({{ct|SKY|2015}}), [[Luke Rowe]] ({{ct|SKY|2015|nolink=yes}}), [[Greg Van Avermaet]] ({{ct|BMC|2015}}) and [[Tom Boonen]] ({{ct|OPQ|2015|nolink=yes}}). Kristoff moved up into fifth place in the overall standings thanks to this split and the time bonus for winning the stage. He also took over leadership of the silver jersey of the points classification. Terpstra retained his overall lead, while Rowe remained the leader of the young riders classification.<ref name=cyclingnews-s4-result/>

=== Stage 5 ===

[[File:Tour du Qatar 2015 (A5).jpg|thumbnail|right|Stage 5 route]]

Stage 5 was a {{convert|153|km|0|abbr=on}} route starting at [[Al Zubarah Fort]]. The riders first travelled east towards [[Al Ghuwariyah]], before returning to Al Zubarah. The route then took them north-east along the coast, before finishing with two laps of a circuit in [[Madinat ash Shamal]].<ref name=pcs-s5-profile>{{cite web|title=Tour of Qatar 2015 - Stage 5|url=http://www.procyclingstats.com/race/Tour_of_Qatar_2015_Stage_5_Madinat_ash_Shamal-profiles|website=ProCyclingStats|accessdate=13 February 2015}}</ref>

{{ct|OPQ|2015}} once again attacked early in the stage, breaking the peloton into echelons in the opening kilometres. [[Maciej Bodnar]] ({{ct|TTS|2015}}), in second place overnight, was among the riders who failed to make the lead group. The gap between the groups never extended much beyond half a minute and, after around {{convert|60|km|0|abbr=on}} of racing, Bodnar's group was able to rejoin the lead group and the racing, which had been frenetic until that point, calmed down.<ref name=cyclingnews-s5-result>{{cite web|last1=Farrand|first1=Stephen|title=Kristoff takes his third sprint victory|url=http://www.cyclingnews.com/races/tour-of-qatar-2015/stage-5/results|website=Cyclingnews.com|accessdate=13 February 2015}}</ref><ref name=velonews-s5-result>{{cite web|title=Kristoff takes win number three at Tour of Qatar|url=http://velonews.competitor.com/2015/02/news/road/kristoff-takes-win-no-3-tour-qatar_360699|website=VeloNews|accessdate=13 February 2015}}</ref>

[[File:Zubara Fort.jpg|180x180px|thumbnail|left|[[Al Zubarah Fort]]]] At that point a breakaway formed, made up of [[Ben Hermans]] ({{ct|BMC|2015}}), [[Marco Haller (cyclist)|Marco Haller]] ({{ct|KAT|2015}}), [[Jelle Wallays]] ({{ct|TSV|2015}}), [[Dmitriy Gruzdev]] ({{ct|AST|2015}}) and [[Mathew Hayman]] ({{ct|OGE|2015}}). The five riders at one point had a lead of over two and a half minutes.<ref name=cyclingtips-s5>{{cite web|title=Niki Terpstra keeps lead in Qatar despite Tinkoff-Saxo pressure|url=http://cyclingtips.com.au/2015/02/daily-news-digest-15/|website=Cyclingtips.com.au|accessdate=13 February 2015|first1=Matt|last1=de Neef}}</ref> Hayman won both intermediate sprints and at one point was virtual leader of the race, before the peloton behind took up the chase in earnest. The breakaway was caught with {{convert|13|km|0|abbr=on}} remaining.<ref name=cyclingnews-s5-result/><ref name=velonews-s5-result/>

In the final six kilometres, {{ct|KAT|2015|nolink=yes}} and {{ct|BMC|2015|nolink=yes}} attacked and forced another split in the peloton. [[Tom Boonen]] was among two {{ct|OPQ|2015|nolink=yes}} riders in the 10-man front group, but [[Niki Terpstra]], the race leader, was not. [[Alexander Kristoff]] ({{ct|KAT|2015|nolink=yes}}) and Maciej Bodnar were in the lead group, which built a lead of 15 seconds. Terpstra would have lost the race lead, but {{ct|OPQ|2015|nolink=yes}} were able to bring the groups back together.<ref name=velonews-s5-result/><ref name=cyclingweekly-s5>{{cite web|last1=Nick|first1=Bull|title=Niki Terpstra keeps lead in Qatar despite Tinkoff-Saxo pressure|url=http://www.cyclingweekly.co.uk/racing/niki-terpstra-keeps-lead-qatar-despite-tinkoff-saxo-pressure-157304|website=Cycling Weekly|accessdate=13 February 2015}}</ref> After the race, it was revealed that the three {{ct|TTS|2015|nolink=yes}} riders in the leading group were not aware that Terpstra had been dropped and, with team radios banned, [[Directeur sportif|''directeur sportif'']] [[Bjarne Riis]] was not able to inform them.<ref name=cyclingweekly-s5/><ref name=cyclingnews-s5-kristoff>{{cite web|last1=Benson|first1=Daniel|title=http://www.cyclingnews.com/news/kristoff-realistic-about-chances-of-winning-tour-of-qatar|url=http://www.cyclingnews.com/news/kristoff-realistic-about-chances-of-winning-tour-of-qatar|website=Cyclingnews.com|accessdate=13 February 2015}}</ref>

As they approached the finishing line, Kristoff again opened his sprint early and was able to hold off the rest of the field for his third stage victory of the race. [[Peter Sagan]] ({{ct|TTS|2015|nolink=yes}}) finished second and [[Nikias Arndt]], again sprinting for {{ct|GIA|2015}} in place of [[Marcel Kittel]], finished third. Sagan therefore moved into first place in the young riders competition, overtaking [[Luke Rowe]] ({{ct|SKY|2015}}).<ref name=cyclingnews-s5-result/>

Thanks to the time bonus on the finish line, Kristoff was now in third place overall, just 11 seconds behind Terpstra. This meant that Kristoff could win the overall victory in the race if he was able to win the final stage and take time bonuses at the intermediate sprints.<ref name=cyclingnews-s5-terpstra>{{cite web|last1=Benson|first1=Daniel|title=Terpstra ready to fight for overall success at the Tour of Qatar|url=http://www.cyclingnews.com/news/terpstra-ready-to-fight-for-overall-success-at-the-tour-of-qatar|website=Cyclingnews.com|accessdate=13 February 2015}}</ref>

Following the stage, the race organisers announced that [[Lars Boom]] ({{ct|AST|2015|nolink=yes}}) had been disqualified from the race. His bike had developed a puncture about {{convert|20|km|0|abbr=on}} from the finish and he had attempted to regain contact with the peloton by chasing in the slipstream of his team car.<ref>{{cite web|title=News shorts: Merckx backs Contador's Giro-Tour double|url=http://www.cyclingnews.com/news/news-shorts-merckx-backs-contadors-giro-tour-double|website=Cyclingnews.com|accessdate=14 February 2015}}</ref>

The final stage of the 2015 Tour of Qatar started where stage 1 had finished, at the Sealine Beach Resort south of [[Mesaieed]]. It took the riders north to [[Doha]].

After the previous stage, [[Niki Terpstra]] ({{ct|OPQ|2015}}) had indicated that his team would happily allow a breakaway to win the stage in order to deny [[Alexander Kristoff]] ({{ct|KAT|2015}}) the possibility of taking overall victory with the aid of the bonus seconds for the stage win and intermediate sprints.<ref name=cyclingnews-s5-terpstra/> A break was allowed to go away early, formed of [[Marcus Burghardt]] ({{ct|BMC|2015}}), [[Preben Van Hecke]] ({{ct|TSV|2015}}), [[Nicola Boem]] and [[Stefano Pirazzi]] (both {{ct|CSF|2015}}). They were able to build a lead of over two minute, but {{ct|KAT|2015|nolink=yes}} took up the chase to support Kristoff in seeking bonus seconds.<ref name=velonews-s6>{{cite web|title=Terpstra defends Tour of Qatar title|url=http://velonews.competitor.com/2015/02/news/road/terpstra-defends-tour-qatar-title_360771|website=VeloNews|accessdate=13 February 2015}}</ref><ref name=cyclingnews-s6-result>{{cite web|title=Sam Bennett wins final stage of Tour of Qatar|url=http://www.cyclingnews.com/races/tour-of-qatar-2015/stage-6/results|website=Cyclingnews.com|accessdate=13 February 2015}}</ref>

With a ten-second bonus available to the stage winner, Kristoff was now within reach of the overall win.<ref name=velonews-s6/><ref name=cyclingnews-s6-result/>

{{ct|OPQ|2015|nolink=yes}} then sent their rider [[Iljo Keisse]] into a breakaway alongside [[Gijs van Hoecke]] ({{ct|TSV|2015}}), with the intent of preventing Kristoff winning any more bonus seconds. Keisse won the intermediate sprint with van Hoecke second; they then allowed the peloton <U+2013> led by Katusha <U+2013> to catch them.<ref name=velonews-s6/>

Kristoff finished 19th; he therefore failed to gain the bonus seconds he needed for overall victory and finished nine seconds behind Terpstra. Terpstra therefore won the Tour of Qatar for the second successive season. Kristoff won the silver jersey of the points competition, thanks to his three stage wins, while Sagan won the young riders competition. {{ct|OPQ|2015|nolink=yes}} won the teams competition.<ref name=cyclingnews-s6-result/>

==Classification leadership table==

In the 2015 Tour of Qatar, three different jerseys were awarded. The first of these was the [[general classification]]. It was calculated by adding together the times recorded in each stage of the race, then making adjustments to take account of bonus seconds won for stage victories and intermediate sprints in the road stages (the winner of the [[individual time trial]] did not receive bonus seconds). The winner of each stage received a ten-second bonus; the rider coming second received a six-second bonus; the third rider across the line received a four-second bonus. Similarly, the winner, second-placed and third-placed riders in intermediate sprints won three-, two- and one-second bonuses respectively. If two riders were tied on the same time, the precise time (to one-hundredths of a second) recorded in the time trial would have been used to separate the riders. The leader of the general classification wore a gold jersey and the winner of the competition is considered the overall winner of the race.<ref name="cyclingnews-s6-result" /><ref name=letour-rules>{{cite web|title=Sporting stakes / rules - Tour of Qatar 2015|url=http://www.letour.fr/tour-of-qatar/2015/us/sporting-stakes-rules.html|website=letour.fr|publisher=Amaury Sport Organisation|accessdate=14 February 2015|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20150206061821/http://www.letour.fr/tour-of-qatar/2015/us/sporting-stakes-rules.html|archivedate=6 February 2015}}</ref>

The [[points classification]] was determined by adding together the points that each rider won on each stage. Points were awarded for coming in the top ten in the stage (the winner won 15 points; the tenth-placed rider won one point). Points were also awarded for coming in the top three in the intermediate sprints that took place on each road stage (three points for the winner, two for the second-placed rider and one for the third). The leader of the points classification was awarded a silver jersey.<ref name=letour-rules/>

The third classification was the young rider classification. This was open to riders born on or after 1 January 1990. The first eligible rider in the general classification was considered the leader of the young rider classification and was awarded a pearl white jersey.<ref name=letour-rules/>

Finally, there was a classification for teams. After each stage, the times of the first three riders on each team were added together. The team with the lowest cumulative time was the leader of the team classification.<ref name=letour-rules/>
