'''George''', (died 29 April 2007), was a [[Jack Russell Terrier]] from New Zealand who was posthumously awarded a [[PDSA Gold Medal]] in February 2009. He defended children from an attack by two [[Pit Bull]]s, later dying of his injuries.

==Biography==
In April 2007, George was playing with a group of five children, aged between three and twelve years old, as they returned home from a local shop. They were set upon by a pair of [[Pit Bull]]s, with George intervening between the two other dogs and the children. Richard Rosewarne, who was one of the five children, said of the attack, "George tried to protect us by barking and rushing at them, but they started to bite him - one on the head and the other on the back".<ref name=mail2007>{{cite news|title=Tiny terrier sacrifices its life to save five children from pitbulls|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-452184/Tiny-terrier-sacrifices-life-save-children-pitbulls.html|newspaper=Daily Mail|date=2 May 2007}}</ref>

The injuries inflicted on George were so severe that his owner, Allan Gay, need to [[Animal euthanasia|put him down]]. The two Pit Bulls were surrendered by their owner to dog control officers,<ref name=mail2007/> and they were subsequently euthanased.<ref name=purpleheart>{{cite news|title=Purple Heart for brave George|url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/world/purple-heart-for-brave-george/2007/05/08/1178390293699.html|newspaper=The Sydney Morning Herald|date=8 May 2007}}</ref> 

The New Zealand Society for the Protection of Animals awarded George a bravery medal, presenting it to his owner at the school that the children attend. [[Vietnam war]] [[veteran]] Jerrell Hudman proposed that he would send one the three [[Purple Heart]]s he was awarded during his military service to honor George's memory, describing the dog as "a little warrior".<ref name=purpleheart/> His memory was commemorated with a bronze statue in [[Manaia, Taranaki]], New Zealand.<ref name=statue>{{cite news|title=A Jack Russell terrier named George|url=http://www.stratfordpress.co.nz/local/news/a-jack-russell-terrier-named-george/3754531/|newspaper=Stratford Press|date=7 November 2007}}</ref>

In 2009, George was posthumously awarded a [[PDSA Gold Medal]] (the animal equivalent of the [[George Cross]]) by the [[People's Dispensary for Sick Animals]]. His owner was presented with the medal by Governor-General [[Anand Satyanand]] in a ceremony at Manaia.<ref name=sky2009>{{cite news|title=Hero Dog Dies Fighting Pit Bulls|url=http://news.sky.com/skynews/Home/World-News/Dog-Bravery-Jack-Russell-George-Awarded-PDSA-Gold-Medal-For-Saving-Children-From-Pit-Bull-Terriers/Article/200902215220504|newspaper=Sky.com|date=11 February 2009}}</ref>
