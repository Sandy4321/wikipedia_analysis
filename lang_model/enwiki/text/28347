However, Temple lost star player [[Dionte Christmas]] to graduation, whom Blue Ribbon Yearbook said that, if "anything good that happened to the Owls last year, Christmas had a hand in it."<ref name="blueribbon"/> He lead Temple in three statistics: points per game (19.5), three-pointers completed  (107), and total steals (51); he finished second in two more: rebounds per game (5.5) and assists (28).<ref name="blueribbon"/> In addition, he was an honorable mention All-American and scored 2,000 points over his college basketball career.

==Season==
===Preconference season===
The Owls kicked off their season on November 14, 2009 with a 76-56 win against the [[University of Delaware]], sending the Fighting Blue Hens to their fourth straight loss as a home opener.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/ncb/recap?gameId=293180048|title=Temple 76, Delaware 56|date=15 November 2009|work=[[Associated Press]]|publisher=[[ESPN]]|accessdate=22 December 2009}}</ref> On November 17, the Owls failed to capitalize on preseason #19 [[Georgetown Hoyas men's basketball|Georgetown Hoyas]]' sloppy play, as the Hoyas were victorious 45-46. The game featured more fouls (18) and turnovers (16) than completed baskets (15) for Georgetown, playing their home opener at the [[Verizon Center]]. Georgetown led 19-13 at halftime, but Temple managed to mount a comeback, as they led with 6 seconds left in regulation until Hoya [[Greg Monroe]] scored the winning 3-pointer. After the game, Temple's 68-game winning streak when opponents scored less than 50 points was crushed.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/ncb/recap?gameId=293210046|title=Hoyas blow 12-point second-half lead but hold off Owls|date=18 November 2009|work=[[Associated Press]]|publisher=[[ESPN]]|accessdate=22 December 2009}}</ref>

On November 21, Temple beat the [[Siena Saints]], after overcoming a six point deficit at the half to end the game at 73-69.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/ncb/recap?gameId=293250218|title=Temple 73, Siena 69|date=22 November 2009|work=[[Associated Press]]|publisher=[[ESPN]]|accessdate=25 December 2009}}</ref> As a result, the Owls began receiving votes in the [[2008-09 NCAA Division I men's basketball rankings]] for the week of November 23.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/ncb/rankings?seasonYear=2010&weekNumber=3&seasonType=2|title=2010 NCAA Men's Basketball Rankings (Nov. 23)|accessdate=15 January 2010|date=23 November 2009|work=[[ESPN]]|publisher=ESPN Internet Ventures}}</ref> After an easy win against [[Ball State]] on November 24, the Owls next faced [[Virginia Tech]] in the semifinals of the [[Philly Hoop Group Classic]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/ncb/recap?gameId=293280218 |title=Temple 66, Ball State 46|date=24 November 2009|work=[[Associated Press]]|publisher=[[ESPN]]|accessdate=14 January 2009}}</ref><ref name=hokies>{{cite news|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/ncb/recap?gameId=293310218 |title=Temple 61, Virginia Tech 50|date=27 November 2009|work=[[Associated Press]]|publisher=[[ESPN]]|accessdate=14 January 2009}}</ref> Temple overcame [[Malcolm Delaney]]'s 32 points to defeat the Hokies 60-51 on November 27. Their 4-1 start was the Owls' best since 2000.<ref name=hokies/>

The team suffered their second loss of the season by the undefeated [[St. John's Red Storm|Red Storm of St. John's]] on November 28, in the championship game of the Philly Hoop Group Classic. Temple led 22-21 at the half, but the Red Storm went on a 14-2 run in the beginning of the second half from which the Owls could not recover, and St. John's won 55-48.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/ncb/recap?gameId=293320218 |title=St. John's 55, Temple 48 |date=29 November 2009|work=[[Associated Press]]|publisher=[[ESPN]]|accessdate=15 January 2009}}</ref> This caused Temple to lose all support in the national rankings.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/ncb/rankings?seasonYear=2010&weekNumber=4&seasonType=2|title=2010 NCAA Men's Basketball Rankings (Nov. 30)|accessdate=15 January 2010|date=30 November 2009|work=[[ESPN]]|publisher=ESPN Internet Ventures}}</ref> The Owls rebounded with three consecutive wins: against [[2009<U+2013>10 Western Michigan Broncos men's basketball team|Western Michigan]], [[2009<U+2013>10 Penn State Nittany Lions men's basketball team|Penn State]], and [[Miami RedHawks men's basketball|Miami of Ohio]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/ncb/recap?gameId=293352711 |title=Temple 76, W.
