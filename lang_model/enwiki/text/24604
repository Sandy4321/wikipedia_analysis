{{nihongo|'''''Demon City Shinjuku'''''|<U+9B54><U+754C><U+90FD><U+5E02> (<U+65B0><U+5BBF>)|Makai Toshi: Shinjuku}} is a novel by [[Hideyuki Kikuchi]] that was adapted into an [[original animated video]] (OVA) in 1988, directed by [[Yoshiaki Kawajiri]]. The title has also been translated as ''Hell City Shinjuku'' and ''Monster City''. It was also released as two manga by ADV Manga in 2003 and 2004. The novel was also released in English in 2011, compiled with its sequel ''Demon Palace Babylon''.

The film was released in [[North America]] by [[Central Park Media]] in 1994. Portions of the opening fight scene were featured in the 1995 [[cyberpunk]] film ''[[Johnny Mnemonic (film)|Johnny Mnemonic]]''.

== Plot ==

The movie begins with a battle between fates, the evil Rebi Ra (also pronounced Levi Ra or even Devi Da) versus the short-lived hero Genichirou. Rebi Ra has allowed himself to be possessed in order to gain the incredible powers of evil and plans to summon demons to conquer the world. Defeating Genichirou and destroying [[Shinjuku, Tokyo|Shinjuku]], a part of Tokyo, with a devastating earthquake, the area becomes a demon-haunted wilderness.
The novel doesn't have a fight scene between Genichirou and Rebi Ra. It opens with a quiet time in Shinjuku and then in a sudden change the Demon Quake hits only Shinjuku.

Ten years later, the World President, put in place to uphold world peace, is attacked by Rebi Ra indirectly to keep his old master, Aguni Lai (Aguni Rai), as the protector of the president, occupied. However, Rebi Ra did not know that Genichirou had a son who inherited his powers and more. After an emotional plea from the president's daughter, Sayaka Rama, the unlikely hero Kyoya Izayoi follows her deep into the heart of the evil city, finding new allies and terrifying enemies along the way.
In the novel Aguni Rai asks the Information Bureau Japan Section Chief to look for Kyoya as the only one who could stop Rebi Ra. The Section Chief tests Kyoya with a commando cyborg and then relates to Kyoya that the president is in a life threatening curse and only has three days to defeat Rebi Ra before the president is killed as the ritual sacrifice to bring the Demon Realm to Earth, which he failed to do years prior, causing the Demon Quake. During the course of explanation Aguni Rai uses a doppelganger to communicate to Kyoya from New York in hopes of convincing him to save the world. Sayaka soon enters and pleads with him to do so as well. Kyoya finally decides to help because of Sayaka's pleas.

==Reception==
''[[Hyper (magazine)|Hyper]]'''s Daniel Wilks criticises the film for having "only vaguely interconnected action scenes punctuated by some rather dull talkiness marred by horrible accents (the heroine is unconvincingly British and the childish sidekick speaks with a mangled Mexican drawl)".<ref>{{cite journal|last=Wilks|first=Daniel|date=December 2006|title=Demon City Shinjuku|journal=[[Hyper (magazine)|Hyper]]|publisher=[[Next Media]]|issue=158|pages=85|issn=1320-7458}}</ref> Ironically, as the film was dubbed in Britain, the aforementioned heroine is a genuine British person.
