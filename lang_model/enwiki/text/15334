The modern state of Israel has its roots in the [[Land of Israel]], a concept central to [[Judaism]] for over three thousand years. After [[World War I]], the [[League of Nations]] approved the [[British Mandate for Palestine]] with the intent of creating a "national home for the Jewish people".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.yale.edu/lawweb/avalon/mideast/palmanda.htm |publisher=Yale University |work=The Avalon Project |title=The Palestine Mandate |date=[[1922-07-24]] |accessdate=2007-09-06}}</ref> In 1947, the [[United Nations]] [[United Nations General Assembly Resolution 181|approved]] the partition of the Mandate of Palestine into two states, one Jewish and one [[Arab]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.yale.edu/lawweb/avalon/un/res181.htm |publisher=Yale University |title=United Nations General Assembly Resolution 181 |accessdate=2007-08-21 |date=[[1947-11-29]] |work=The Avalon Project}}</ref> The [[Arab League]] rejected the plan, but on [[May 14]], [[1948]], Israel [[Declaration of Independence (Israel)|declared]] its independence. The new country's victory in the subsequent [[1948 Arab-Israeli War|Arab-Israeli War]] expanded the borders of the Jewish state beyond those in the UN Partition Plan. Since then, Israel has been [[Arab-Israeli conflict|in conflict]] with many of the [[Arab League and the Arab-Israeli conflict|neighboring Arab countries]], resulting in several major wars and decades of violence. Throughout the conflict, [[Borders of Israel|Israel's boundaries]] have been subject to dispute, although Israel has signed peace treaties with [[Israel-Egypt Peace Treaty|Egypt]] and [[Israel-Jordan Treaty of Peace|Jordan]], and efforts are being made to reach a permanent accord with the [[Peace process in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict|Palestinians]].

==Etymology==
Over the past three thousand years, the name "Israel" has meant in common and religious usage both the [[Land of Israel]] and the entire [[Jews|Jewish nation]]. The name originated from a verse in the [[Bible]] ([[Genesis]], 32:28) where [[Jacob]] is renamed Israel after successfully wrestling with an angel of God.<ref>From the [[King James Version of the Bible]]: "And he said, Thy name shall be called no more Jacob, but Israel: for as a prince hast thou power with God and with men, and hast prevailed." ([[Genesis]], 32:28)</ref> Commentators differ on the meaning of the name. Some say the name comes from the verb <U+015B>arar ("to rule, be strong, have authority over"), thereby making the name mean "God rules" or "God judges".<ref>{{harvnb|Hamilton|1995|p=334}}</ref> Other possible meanings include "the prince of God" (from the [[King James Version of the Bible]]) or "[[El (god)|El]] fights/struggles".<ref>{{harvnb|Wenham|1994|pp=296<U+2013>97}}</ref> Regardless of the precise meaning of the name, the biblical nation fathered by Jacob thus became the "[[Children of Israel]]" or the "[[Israelite]]s". 

The first historical mention of the word "Israel" comes from the [[Merneptah Stele]] of [[Ancient Egypt]] (dated the late 13th century BC), although experts have not been able to agree on whether the term was being used to refer to a [[people]] or a [[homeland]].<ref>{{harvnb|Barton|Bowden|2004|p=126}}. "The Merneptah Stele... is arguably the oldest evidence outside the Bible for the existence of Israel as early as the thirteenth century BCE."</ref> The modern country was named ''Medinat Yisrael'', or the State of Israel, after other proposed names, including ''[[Eretz Israel]]'', [[Zion]], and [[Judea]], were rejected.<ref>{{cite news |publisher=The Palestine Post |date=[[1947-12-07]] |pages=1 |title=Popular Opinion}}</ref> In the early weeks of independence, the government chose the term "Israeli" to denote a citizen of Israel, with the formal announcement made by Minister of Foreign Affairs [[Moshe Sharett]].<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,798687-2,00.html | publisher=[[Time (magazine)|TIME Magazine]] |date=[[1948-05-31]] |title=On the Move |accessdate=2007-08-06}}</ref>

==History==
{{main|History of the State of Israel}}
{{see|History of the Jews in the Land of Israel}}
===Early roots===
{{see|History of ancient Israel and Judah}}
The [[Land of Israel]], known in Hebrew as ''Eretz Yisrael'', has been sacred to the [[Jew]]ish people since the time of the [[Patriarch (Bible)|biblical patriarchs]]: [[Abraham]], [[Isaac]], and [[Jacob]]. The Bible has placed this period in the early 2nd millennium BCE.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.pbs.org/walkingthebible/timeline.html |publisher=Public Broadcast Television |title=Walking the Bible Timeline |work=Walking the Bible |accessdate=2007-09-29}}</ref> According to the [[Torah]], the Land of Israel was promised to the Jews as their homeland,<ref>From the [[King James Version of the Bible]]: "And the Lord thy God will bring thee into the land which thy fathers possessed, and thou shalt possess it; and he will do thee good, and multiply thee above thy fathers." ([[Deuteronomy]], 30:5)</ref><ref>From the [[King James Version of the Bible]]: "But if ye turn unto me, and keep my commandments, and do them; though there were of you cast out unto the uttermost part of the heaven, yet will I gather them from thence, and will bring them unto the place that I have chosen to set my name there." ([[Nehemiah]], 1:9)</ref> and the sites holiest to [[Judaism]] are located there. Around the 11th century BCE, the first of a series of [[History of ancient Israel and Judah|Jewish kingdoms and states]] established rule over the [[Land of Israel#Dimensions of the Land of Israel|region]]; these Jewish kingdoms and states ruled intermittently for the following one thousand years.<ref>{{harvnb|Friedland|Hecht|2000|p=8}}. "For a thousand years Jerusalem was the seat of Jewish sovereignty, the household site of kings, the location of its legislative councils and courts."</ref>

Between the time of the Jewish kingdoms and the 7th-century [[Muslim conquests]], the Land of Israel fell under [[Assyria]]n, [[Babylonia]]n, [[Persian Empire|Persian]], [[Hellenistic Greece|Greek]], [[Roman Empire|Roman]], [[Sassanid Empire|Sassanian]], and [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] rule<ref>[http://www.mapsofwar.com/ind/imperial-history.html| Middle East control throughout history]</ref>. Jewish presence in the region dwindled after the failure of the [[Bar Kokhba revolt]] against the [[Roman Empire]] in 132&nbsp;CE and the resultant large-scale expulsion of Jews. Nevertheless, a continuous Jewish presence in [[Palestine]] was maintained, although the main Jewish population shifted from the [[Judea]] region to the [[Galilee]];<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.usd.edu/erp/Palestine/history.htm |publisher=The University of South Dakota |title=Palestine: History |accessdate=2007-07-05 |date=[[2007-02-22]] |work=The Online Encyclopedia of the Roman Provinces}}</ref> the [[Talmud]], one of Judaism's most important religious texts, was composed in Israel during this period.<ref>{{harvnb|Mor<U+00E7><U+00F6>l|2006|p=304}}</ref> The Land of Israel was captured from the [[Byzantine Empire]] around 636&nbsp;CE during the initial Muslim conquests.

===Zionism and the British Mandate===
{{main|Zionism|Aliyah|British Mandate of Palestine}}
{{see also|1922 Text: League of Nations Palestine Mandate|Jewish refugees|Timeline of Zionism}}
{{Aliyah}}
Jews living in the [[Jewish diaspora|Diaspora]] have long aspired to return to Zion and the [[Land of Israel]].<ref>{{harvnb|Rosenzweig|p=1}}. "Zionism, the urge of the Jewish people to return to Palestine, is almost as ancient as the Jewish diaspora itself. Some Talmudic statements... Almost a millennium later, the poet and philosopher Yehuda Halevi... In the 19th century..."</ref> That hope and yearning was articulated in the [[Bible]]<ref>From the [[King James Version of the Bible]]: "For out of Zion shall go forth the law, and the word of the Lord from Jerusalem." (Isaiah, 2:3)</ref> and is a central theme in the [[siddur|Jewish prayer book]]. Beginning in the twelfth century, a small but steady stream of Jews began to leave Europe to settle in the Holy Land. After Jews were [[Alhambra decree|expelled]] from [[Spain]] in 1492, some made their way to the Land of Israel.<ref>{{harvnb|Gilbert|2005|p=2}}. "Jews sought a new homeland here after their expulsions from Spain (1492)..."</ref> During the 16th century, the pace stepped up, and large communities struck roots in [[Jerusalem]], [[Hebron]], [[Safed]] and [[Tiberias]]. In the second half of the 18th century, entire [[Hasidic Judaism|Hasidic]] communities from [[Poland]], [[Galicia]] and [[Ukraine]] settled in the Holy Land with their rabbis.<ref>{{harvnb|Ausubel|1964|pp=142<U+2013>4}}</ref>

[[Image:Herzl-balcony.jpg|left|thumb|upright|[[Theodor Herzl]], visionary of the Jewish State]]
The first large wave of modern immigration, known as the [[First Aliyah]] (Hebrew: <U+05E2><U+05DC><U+05D9><U+05D9><U+05D4>), began in 1881, as Jews fled [[Pogrom#1881-84|pogroms]] in [[Eastern Europe]].<ref name="aliyot">{{cite web|url=http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Immigration/immigtoc.html |publisher=The American-Israeli Cooperative Enterprise |work=Jewish Virtual Library |accessdate=2007-07-12 |title=Immigration}} The source provides information on the First, Second, Third, Fourth, and Fifth Aliyot in their respective articles. The White Paper leading to Aliyah Bet is discussed [http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Immigration/Aliyah_during_war.html here].</ref> While the Zionist movement already existed in theory, [[Theodor Herzl]] is credited with founding political [[Zionism]],<ref>{{harvnb|Kornberg|1993}} "How did Theodor Herzl, an assimilated German nationalist in the 1880s, suddenly in the 1890s become the founder of Zionism?"</ref> a movement which sought to establish a Jewish state in the Land of Israel, by elevating the Jewish question to the international plane.<ref>{{harvnb|Herzl|1946|p=11}}</ref> In 1896, Herzl published ''[[Der Judenstaat]]'' (''The Jewish State''), offering his vision of a future state; the following year he presided over the first [[World Zionist Congress]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jewishagency.org/JewishAgency/English/Jewish+Education/Compelling+Content/Eye+on+Israel/120/Chapter+One+The+Heralders+of+Zionism.htm |publisher=Jewish Agency for Israel |title=Chapter One: The Heralders of Zionism |accessdate=2007-07-12}}</ref> 

During the [[Second Aliyah]] (1904<U+2013>1914), some 40,000 Jews settled in Palestine.<ref name="aliyot" /> Both the first and second waves of migrants were mainly [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox Jews]],<ref>{{harvnb|Stein|2003|p=88}}. "As with the First Aliyah, most Second Aliyah migrants were non-Zionist orthodox Jews..."</ref> but those in the Second Aliyah included [[socialist]] pioneers who established the ''[[kibbutz]]'' movement.<ref>{{harvnb|Romano|2003|p=30}}</ref> During [[World War I]], British Foreign Secretary [[Arthur Balfour]] issued what became known as the [[Balfour Declaration of 1917|Balfour Declaration]], which "view[ed] with favour the establishment in Palestine of a national home for the Jewish people."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.yale.edu/lawweb/avalon/mideast/balfour.htm |publisher=Yale University |accessdate=2007-07-12 |date=[[1917-11-02]] |work=The Avalon Project at Yale Law School |title=Balfour Declaration 1917}}</ref> The [[Jewish Legion]], a group of battalions composed primarily of Zionist volunteers, assisted in the British conquest of Israel.

"During the First and Second Aliyot, there were many Arab attacks against Jewish settlements... In 1920, [[Hashomer]] was disbanded and [[Haganah]] ("The Defense") was established."</ref> In 1922, the [[League of Nations]] granted [[Great Britain]], a [[British Mandate of Palestine|mandate over Palestine]] for the express purpose of "placing the country under such political, administrative and economic conditions as will secure the establishment of the Jewish national home".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/mod/1922mandate.html |publisher=Fordham University |title=League of Nations: The Mandate for Palestine, July 24, 1922 |work=Modern History Sourcebook |date=[[1922-07-24]] |accessdate=2007-08-27}}</ref> 

Jewish immigration continued with the [[Third Aliyah]] (1919<U+2013>1923) and [[Fourth Aliyah]] (1924<U+2013>1929), which together brought 100,000 Jews to Palestine.<ref name="aliyot" /> In the wake of the [[Jaffa riots]] in the early days of the Mandate, the British restricted Jewish immigration and territory slated for the Jewish state was allocated to [[Transjordan]].<ref>{{harvnb|Liebreich|2005|p=34}}</ref> The [[Hitler's rise to power|rise of Nazism]] in the 1930s led to the [[Aliyah#Fifth Aliyah (1929-1939)|Fifth Aliyah]], with an influx of a quarter of a million Jews. This influx resulted in the [[1936-1939 Arab revolt in Palestine|Arab revolt of 1936<U+2013>1939]] and led the British to cap immigration with the [[White Paper of 1939]]. With countries around the world turning away Jewish refugees fleeing the [[Holocaust]], a clandestine movement known as [[Aliyah Bet]] was organized to bring Jews to Palestine.<ref name="aliyot" /> By the end of [[World War II]], Jews accounted for 33% of the population of Palestine, up from 11% in 1922.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mideastweb.org/palpop.htm |title=The Population of Palestine Prior to 1948 |accessdate=2007-07-12 |publisher=MidEastWeb}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.israelipalestinianprocon.org/populationpalestine.html |publisher=Israeli - Palestinian ProCon.org |accessdate=2007-07-12 |title=Population Statistics}}</ref>

===Series of conflicts===
In 1967, [[Egypt]], [[Jordan]], and [[Syria]] massed troops close to Israeli borders, expelled [[United Nations Emergency Force|UN peacekeepers]] and blocked Israel's access to the [[Red Sea]]. Israel saw these actions as a ''[[casus belli]]'' for a [[preemptive war|pre-emptive strike]] that launched the [[Six-Day War]], during which it captured the [[West Bank]], [[Gaza Strip]], [[Sinai Peninsula]] and [[Golan Heights]].<ref>{{harvnb|Smith|2006|p=126}}. "Nasser, the Egyptian president, decided to mass troops in the Sinai...casus belli by Israel."</ref> The 1949 [[Green Line (Israel)|Green Line]] became the administrative boundary between Israel and the [[Israeli-occupied territories|occupied territories]]. [[Jerusalem]]'s boundaries were enlarged, incorporating [[East Jerusalem]]. The [[Jerusalem Law]], passed in 1980, reaffirmed this measure and [[UN_Security_Council_Resolution_478|reignited international controversy]] over the [[Positions on Jerusalem|status of Jerusalem]].   

[[Image:Golda Meir 03265u.jpg|right|thumb|upright|Prime Minister [[Golda Meir]], who resigned following the [[Yom Kippur War]]]]
In the early 1970s, Palestinian groups launched a [[Palestinian political violence|wave of attacks]] against Israeli targets around the world, including [[Munich massacre|a massacre]] of Israeli athletes at the [[1972 Summer Olympics]].

The [[Israeli legislative election, 1977|1977 Knesset elections]] marked a major turning point in Israeli political history as [[Menachem Begin|Menachem Begin's]] [[Likud]] party took control from the [[Labor Party (Israel)|Labor Party]].<ref>{{harvnb|Bregman|2002|pp=169<U+2013>70}} "In hindsight we can say that 1977 was a turning point..."</ref> Later that year, Egyptian President [[Anwar Al Sadat]] made a trip to Israel and spoke before the [[Knesset]] in what was the first recognition of Israel by an Arab head of state.<ref>{{harvnb|Bergman|2002|pp=171<U+2013>4}}</ref> In the two years that followed, Sadat and [[Menachem Begin]] signed the [[Camp David Accords]] and the [[Israel-Egypt Peace Treaty]].<ref>{{harvnb|Bregman|2002|pp=186<U+2013>7}}</ref> Israel withdrew from the Sinai Peninsula and agreed to enter negotiations over an [[Autonomous area|autonomy]] for Palestinians across the Green Line, a plan which was never implemented.

{{main|Geography of Israel}}
Israel is located at the eastern end of the [[Mediterranean Sea]], bounded by [[Lebanon]] to the north, [[Syria]] and [[Jordan]] to the east, and [[Egypt]] to the southwest. The sovereign territory of Israel, excluding all territories captured by Israel during the 1967 [[Six-Day War]], is approximately {{convert|20770|sqkm|sqmi|0|sp=us}} in area, of which two percent is water.<ref name="cia" /> The total area under Israeli law, including [[East Jerusalem]] and the [[Golan Heights]], is {{convert|22072|sqkm|sqmi|0|sp=us}}.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www1.cbs.gov.il/shnaton57/st01_01.pdf |title=Area of Districts, Sub-Districts, Natural Regions and Lakes |publisher=[[Israel Central Bureau of Statistics]] |work=Statistical Abstract of Israel |year=2006 }}</ref> The total area under Israeli control, including the military-controlled and [[Palestinian National Authority|Palestinian-governed]] territory of the [[West Bank]], is {{convert|27799|sqkm|sqmi|0|sp=us}}.<ref name="loc-geo">{{cite web |url=http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/iltoc.html |publisher=The Library of Congress |accessdate=2007-07-20 |title=Israel (Geography) |work=Country Studies}}</ref>

Despite its small size, Israel is home to a variety of geographic features, from the [[Negev]] desert in the south to the mountain ranges of the [[Galilee]], [[Mount Carmel|Carmel]], and the [[Golan Heights|Golan]] in the north. The [[Israeli Coastal Plain]] on the shores of the Mediterranean is home to seventy percent of the nation's population. East of the central highlands lies the [[Jordan Rift Valley]], which forms a small part of the 6,500-kilometer (4,040-mi) [[Great Rift Valley]]. The [[Jordan River]] runs along the Jordan Rift Valley, from [[Mount Hermon]] through the [[Hulah Valley]] and the [[Sea of Galilee]] to the [[Dead Sea]], the lowest point on the surface of the Earth.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mfa.gov.il/MFA/MFAArchive/1990_1999/1999/4/FOCUS%20on%20Israel-%20The%20Living%20Dead%20Sea |publisher=Israel Ministry of Foreign Affairs |accessdate=2007-07-20 |date=[[1999-04-01]] |title=The Living Dead Sea}}</ref> Unique to Israel and the [[Sinai Peninsula]] are [[makhtesh]]im, similar to craters.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/tentativelists/1486/ |publisher=UNESCO |title=Makhteshim Country |accessdate=2007-09-19}}</ref> The largest one, [[Ramon Crater]], is located in the Negev and is the world's largest natural crater<ref>{{harvnb|Jacobs|1998|p=284}}.

Temperatures in Israel vary widely, especially during the winter. The more mountainous regions can be windy, cold, and sometimes snowy; Mount Hermon's peak is covered with snow most of the year and [[Jerusalem]] usually receives at least one snowfall each year.<ref>{{harvnb|Goldreich|2003|p=85}}</ref> Meanwhile, coastal cities, such as [[Tel Aviv]] and [[Haifa]], have a typical [[Mediterranean climate]] with cool, rainy winters and long, hot summers.

The Israeli-occupied territories &ndash; the [[Gaza Strip]], the [[West Bank]] and [[East Jerusalem]], and the [[Golan Heights]] &ndash; are the areas Israel captured from [[Egypt]], [[Jordan]], and [[Syria]] during the [[Six-Day War]]. The term was also used to describe the [[Sinai Peninsula]], which was returned to Egypt as part of the 1979 [[Israel-Egypt Peace Treaty]]. Following Israel's capture of these territories, [[Israeli settlement|settlements]] consisting of Israeli citizens were established within each of them. Israel has applied civilian law to the [[Golan Heights Law|Golan Heights]] and [[Jerusalem Law|East Jerusalem]], incorporating them into its territory and offering their inhabitants Israeli citizenship. In contrast, the West Bank and the Gaza Strip have remained under military occupation, and are widely seen &ndash; by Israel, the Palestinians, and the international community alike &ndash; as the site of a future [[Proposals for a Palestinian state|Palestinian state]]. Most negotiations relating to the territories have been on the basis of [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 242]], which calls on Israel to withdraw from occupied territories in return for peaceful actions from Arab states (see [[Land for peace]]).<ref>{{cite web |title=Olmert: Willing to trade land for peace |publisher=[[YNetNews]] |date =[[2006-12-16]] |url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3340641,00.html |accessdate=2007-09-26}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Syria ready to discuss land for peace |publisher=[[The Jerusalem Post]] |date=12 June 2007 |url=http://www.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1181570258086&pagename=JPost%2FJPArticle%2FShowFull |accessdate=2007-09-26

Israel's two official languages are [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] and [[Arabic language|Arabic]].<ref name="cia" /> Hebrew is the primary language of the state and spoken by the majority of the population. Arabic is spoken by the [[Arab]] minority and Jews who immigrated to Israel from Arab lands. Most Israelis can communicate reasonably well in [[English language|English]], as many television programs are in English and many schools begin to teach English in the early grades. As a country of immigrants, dozens of languages can be heard on the streets of Israel. A large influx of people from the former [[Soviet Union]] and [[Ethiopia]] have made [[Russian language|Russian]] and [[Amharic]] widely spoken in Israel. Between 1990 and 1994, the immigration of Jews from the former Soviet Union increased Israel's population by twelve percent.<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/abs/10.1162/003355301753265606?journalCode=qjec |journal=The Quarterly Journal of Economics |month=November |year=2001 |title=The Impact of Mass Migration on the Israeli Labor Market |last=Friedberg |first=Rachel M. |pages=1373}}</ref>

[[Israeli literature]] is primarily poetry and prose written in Hebrew, as part of the renaissance of [[Hebrew]] as a spoken language since the mid-19th century, although a small body of literature is published in other languages, such as Arabic and English. By law, two copies of all printed matter published in Israel must be deposited in the [[Jewish National and University Library]] at the [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem]].
