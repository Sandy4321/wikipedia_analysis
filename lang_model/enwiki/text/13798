The '''Arghun dynasty''' ruled from the late 15th century to the early 16th century the area between southern [[Afghanistan]] and [[Sindh Province]] of [[Pakistan]]. They claimed their descent and name from [[Arghun Khan]] of [[Persia]],<ref>The Travels of Marco Polo - Complete (Mobi Classics) By Marco Polo, Rustichello of Pisa, Henry Yule (Translator)</ref> and were a dynasty of either [[Mongol]],<ref name="Davies, p. 627">Davies, p. 627</ref> [[Turkic peoples|Turkish]] or [[Turko-Mongol]] ethnicity.<ref name="Bosworth p. 329">Bosworth, "New Islamic Dynasties," p. 329</ref> The Arghuns can be divided into two branches: the Arghun branch of Dhu'l-Nun Beg Arghun that ruled until 1554, and the Tarkhan branch of Muhammad 'Isa [[Tarkhan]] that ruled until 1591.<ref name="Bosworth p. 329" />

==Arghun governors of Kandahar==
{{Further|Arghandab}}
In the late 15th century the [[Timurid Empire|Timurid]] sultan of [[Herat]], [[Husayn Bayqarah]], appointed Dhu'l-Nun Beg Arghun as governor of [[Kandahar]]. Dhu'l-Nun Beg soon began to ignore the authority of the central government in Herat and in around 1479 he began expanding in the direction of [[Baluchistan (region)|Baluchistan]], taking over [[Pishin, Pakistan|Pishin]], [[Shal]] and [[Mustang (kingdom)|Mustang]]. In 1485 his sons [[Shah Beg]] and [[Muhammad Mukim Khan]] also seized [[Sibi]] from the [[Samma Dynasty]] of Sindh, although this gain was only temporary.<ref name="Davies, p. 627" />

In 1497 Dhu'l-Nun Beg threw his support behind the revolt of Husayn Bayqarah's son [[Badi' al-Zaman (Timurid ruler)|Badi' al-Zaman]] against his father. Dhu'l-Nun Beg, who married off his daughter to Badi' al-Zaman, subsequently gained a prominent position in the latter's government when the Timurid succeeded Husayn Bayqarah in Herat in 1506.<ref>Babur, Vol. II p. 40</ref> Unfortunately for them, the [[Uzbeks]] under [[Muhammad Shaybani]] invaded [[Greater Khorasan|Khorasan]] shortly after Badi' al-Zaman's ascension. In 1507 Dhu'l-Nun Beg was killed in battle against the Uzbeks and succeeded by his sons Shah Beg and Mukim.<ref name="Davies, p. 627" />

==Wars with Babur==

The Arghuns ultimately lost control of their portion of Afghanistan to the Timurid prince [[Babur]], who had been expelled from [[Transoxiana]] by the Uzbeks and had made his way south to Husayn Bayqarah's kingdom. In 1501/1502 Mukim had peacefully gained the submission of Kabul, which was in chaos after the death of its ruler Ulugh Beg ibn [[Abu Sa'id (Timurid dynasty)|Abu Sa'id]].<ref>Babur, Vol I, p. 126</ref> This was contested by Babur, who besieged and took the city in 1504; Mukim fell back to Kandahar.<ref>Bosworth, "Kabul" p. 357M</ref>

After Dhu'l-Nun Beg's death Babur decided that as long as Shah Beg and Mukim remained in Kandahar they would remain a threat to them. In 1507 or 1508 he attacked them, but the brothers saved their position by agreeing to submit to the Uzbek Muhammad Shaybani. In the following years Babur spent his time fighting against the Uzbeks in an attempt to regain [[Samarkand]], giving Shah Beg and Mukim a degree of respite.<ref name="Davies, p. 627" />

Shah Beg, however, seems to have realized that in the long term it would be impossible to hold Kandahar against Babur. In 1520, in the hopes of establishing a new power base, he invaded Sindh, where the [[Samma Dynasty]] was struggling under [[Jam Feroz]]. Shah Beg defeated Jam Feroz's army and proceeded to sack [[Thatta]]. The two sides agreed to a peace, where Shah Beg gained the upper half of Sindh (Thatta) while the Sammas retained the lower half (Bukkur). Jam Feroz almost immediately broke this agreement, but was defeated by Shah Beg and forced to flee to [[Gujarat]]. This marked the end of Samma rule in Sindh, as Shah Beg gained control of the whole region.<ref name="Davies, p. 627" />

==Arghun Dynasty of Sindh==

===Arghun Branch===

In 1522 Babur took Kandahar after a drawn out siege and annexed it.<ref>Bosworth, "Kandahar," p. 536</ref> Following this, Shah Beg made [[Bukkur]](Lower Sindh) his official capital. He died in 1524 and his son Shah Husayn succeeded him. Shah Husayn had the [[khutba]] read in Babur's name and attacked [[Multan]], probably at Babur's insistence. [[Multan]], which was ruled by the [[Langah (tribe)|Langah]], fell in 1528 after an extended siege and Shah Husayn appointed a governor of the city. Shortly after Shah Husayn departed Multan for [[Thatta]], however, the governor was thrown out of the city. The rebels administered Multan for a time independently, but soon afterwards submitted to the [[Mughal Empire]], which had been founded by Babur after his capture of [[Delhi]] in 1526.<ref>Davies, pp. 627-8</ref>

In 1540 Shah Husayn had to deal with the arrival of Babur's successor [[Humayun]], who had been expelled from [[Hindustan]] by [[Sher Shah Suri]]. Humayun implored Shah Husayn to provide assistance in fighting against Sher Shah, but was unable to convince him to do so. Some time after this Humayun later attempted to wrest [[Sindh]] from Shah Husayn, but the latter was able to force a stalemate. The Mughal Emperor eventually agreed to leave Sindh and made his way to Kandahar in 1543.<ref name="Davies, p. 628">Davies, p. 628</ref>

Shah Husayn became increasingly incapable of ruling as he approached the end of his life. Because of this, the nobles of Sindh decided to elect Mirza Muhammad 'Isa Tarkhan, who was a member of a senior branch of the Arghuns, as their ruler in 1554. Shah Husayn was set aside and died childless in 1556.<ref name="Davies, p. 628" />

===Tarkhan Branch===

During the civil war between Shah Husayn and Muhammad 'Isa Tarkhan, the latter had sent a request for the help to the [[Portuguese Empire|Portuguese]] at [[Vasai-Virar|Bassein]]. A 700 man force under the command of Pedro Barreto Rolim sailed up to Thatta in 1555, only to find that Muhammad 'Isa Tarkhan had already won the conflict and there was no need for their assistance. Furious at the governor of Thatta's refusal to pay them, the Portuguese sacked the defenseless city and killed several thousand people.<ref>"Report of the Western Circle"</ref>

Muhammad 'Isa Tarkhan was soon forced to deal with a rival claimant, [[Sultan Mahmud Kokaltash]] reverently referred to as ''Sultan Mahmud Koka''. He was eventually compelled to make peace with Sultan Mahmud; the two agreed that Muhammad 'Isa Tarkhan would keep lower Sindh, with his capital at Thatta, while Sultan Mahmud would rule upper Sindh from Bakhar. In 1567 Muhammad 'Isa Tarkhan died and was succeeded by his son Muhammad Baqi. During the latter's reign upper Sindh was annexed by the Mughal Emperor [[Akbar]] in 1573.<ref name="Davies, p. 628" />

Mirza Muhammad Baqi committed suicide in 1585, and was succeeded by his son Mirza Jani Beg. In 1591 Akbar sent an army to conquer lower Sindh. Jani Beg put up a resistance but was defeated by the Mughal forces and his principality was annexed. In 1599 he died of [[delirium tremens]].<ref name="Davies, p. 628" />
