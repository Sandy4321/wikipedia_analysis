Having received an academic diploma of an officer of the General Staff after the completion of the curriculum, he was transferred to the Second Branch of the General Staff of the Polish Army in Warsaw on October 1, 1924. During his studies and service at the Staff, he officially remained officer of the 21st Infantry Regiment "Dzieci Warszawy" ("Warsaw's Children").<ref>{{pl icon}} Dziennik Personalny Ministerstwa Spraw Wojskowych Nr 103 z 2 pa<U+017A>dziernika 1924 roku, s. 568.</ref><ref>{{pl icon}} ''Rocznik Oficerski 1924'', Ministerstwo Spraw Wojskowych, Oddzia<U+0142> V Sztabu Generalnego Wojska Polskiego, Warszawa 1924, s. 9, 174, 366.</ref> In the years 1927-1931, he was a military attach<U+00E9> to [[Finland]] and [[Sweden]].<ref>{{pl icon}} ''Rocznik Oficerski 1928'', Ministerstwo Spraw Wojskowych, Warszawa 1928, s. 133, 203.</ref> On November 1, 1931, he was attached to the 67th Infantry Regiment in [[Brodnica]], with which he underwent a practical leadership training session at the head of a riflemen's company.<ref>{{pl icon}} Dziennik Personalny Ministerstwa Spraw Wojskowych Nr 7 z 23 pa<U+017A>dziernika 1931 roku, s. 327.</ref><ref>{{pl icon}} ''Rocznik Oficerski 1932'', Biuro Personalne Ministerstwa Spraw Wojskowych, Warszawa 1932, s. 48, 595.</ref> On December 10, 1932, Chodacki was given to the disposal of the Polish Ministry of Foreign Affairs for the period of six months.<ref>{{pl icon}} Dziennik Personalny Ministerstwa Spraw Wojskowych Nr 13 z 9 grudnia 1932 roku, s. 436.</ref> On June 30, 1933, he was transferred to the reserve, and at the same time from the reserve of the 21st to that of the 30th Infantry Regiment (''30 Pu<U+0142>k Strzelc<U+00F3>w Kaniowskich'') in Warsaw.<ref>{{pl icon}} Dziennik Personalny Ministerstwa Spraw Wojskowych Nr 11 z 7 czerwca 1934 roku, s. 139.</ref>

== Diplomatic service ==
Chodacki was given the function of ministerial adviser in the Political Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. On October 24, 1935, he became [[charg<U+00E9> d<U+2019>affaires]] in the Polish mission to [[Czechoslovakia]].<ref name="Majchrowski" /> He was a confidante of the foreign minister [[J<U+00F3>zef Beck]], who considered him the best politician among the officers transferred from military service to diplomacy.<ref>Mikos (referenced above) quotes the Diary and files of [[Jan Szembek (diplomat)|Jan Szembek]], 1934-1939, t. 1-4, London 1964-1972.</ref> On December 30,<ref>December 16 according to Majchrowski</ref> 1936 Chodacki assumed the office of the Commissioner General of the Republic of Poland in the [[Free City of Gda<U+0144>sk]]. During his term of office, he attained the rank of authorized minister (''minister pe<U+0142>nomocny'') and special envoy (''pose<U+0142> nadzwyczajny''). His uncompromising attitude as General Commissioner caused the quarreling Polish organizations in Gda<U+0144>sk to unite. As for the Polish policy toward the Free City, it did not change under Chodacki and continued to be marked by a strong opposition to the Nazification of the city. The Commissioner often intervened in the defense of Poles, whose health and life at the time was frequently endangered.<ref>The reports of the Polish Commissariat to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs often contained descriptions of German attacks on Poles, for example in the town of Piek<U+0142>o; or on Polish students in the town of Pszcz<U+00F3><U+0142>ki</ref> During Chodacki's service as Commissioner, the work of Polish Intelligence was intensified as employees of the Commissariat collected information about the military preparations in the Free City.<ref name="Mikos" /> Still in August 1939 the Polish Commissioner, according to the accepted custom, paid a visit to the battleship [[SMS Schleswig-Holstein|Schleswig-Holstein]].<ref>Chodacki thus described this moment in his memoirs: ''It was perhaps the toughest moment of my life, that walk under the barrels of heavy ship cannons, and then a glass of champagne in the accompaniment of those snotty officers' mocking smirks.''

Danielewicz ''W kr<U+0119>gu Polonii gda<U+0144>skiej'' Gda<U+0144>sk 1996, ISBN 83-85349-83-9, quoted after: [http://www.wmatlan.else.com.pl/schlezwig.htm Strona domowa Waldemara Matlana]</ref> On September 1, 1939, Chodacki, along with other employees of the Polish Commissariat, was arrested by the Germans. As the result of the protests by the already-expelled High Commissioner of the League of Nations in Gda<U+0144>sk, [[Carl Jakob Burckhardt]], the Germans released Chodacki and others on the border with [[Lithuania]] on September 5.<ref name="Mikos" />

== Second World War and aftermath ==
During [[World War II]], Chodacki was a soldier of the [[Polish Armed Forces in the West|Polish Armed Forces]] in [[France]] and [[Great Britain]].<ref name="Majchrowski" /> He was consequently transferred to the Polish Consulate in [[New York City]] and on September 1, 1943 became the head of the secret branch of Polish Intelligence [[Estezet]].<ref name="Instytut" /> In the years 1944-1945, he was a Polish liaison officer in the rank of major attached to the American [[Office of Strategic Services]].<ref name="Majchrowski" /> After the war, Chodacki worked at the [[J<U+00F3>zef Pi<U+0142>sudski Institute of America|J<U+00F3>zef Pi<U+0142>sudski Institute]] in New York City, serving as executive director between 1949 and 1951.<ref name="Instytut" />
