The '''''Basilica Minore de San Sebastian''''', better known as '''San Sebastian Church''', is a [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] [[Minor basilica#Other minor basilicas|minor basilica]] in [[Manila]], the [[Philippines]]. It is the seat of the '''Parish of San Sebastian''' and the '''National Shrine of Our Lady of Mt. Carmel'''.

Completed in 1891, San Sebastian Church is noted for its [[architecture|architectural features]]. An example of the [[Gothic Revival architecture|revival of Gothic architecture]] in the Philippines, it has been recognized by the [[UNESCO]] as the only [[Steel building|all-steel]] church or basilica in [[Asia]].<ref name=whl>{{cite web |url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/tentativelists/518/ |title=World Heritage: San Sebastian Church |work=Tentative List for the World Heritage List |publisher=UNESCO |accessdate=2008-04-20 }}</ref> It has also been implausibly reputed to be the first [[prefabrication|prefabricated]] building in the world,<ref name=lay>Layug, p. 88. "The basilica is the first and only all-steel church in Asia, the second in the world after the Eiffel Tower of Paris (French engineer Alexandre Gustave Eiffel himself is also rumored to have been involved in the basilica's construction) and probably the first prefabricated building in the world."</ref> and more plausibly claimed as the only prefabricated steel church in the world.<ref>{{cite book |title=Insight Guides: Philippines |editor=Francis Doral |year=2005 |publisher=Discovery Channel & Apa Publications GmbH & Co.

San Sebastian Church is under the care of [[Augustinian Recollects|The Order of the Augustinian Recollects]], who also operate a [[San Sebastian College|college]] adjacent to the basilica. It is located at Plaza del Carmen, at the eastern end of Claro M. Recto Street, in [[Quiapo, Manila]].<ref name=lay7>Layug, p. 87</ref>

==History==
[[Image:San Sebastian1.jpg|thumb|left|250px|The twin spires of '''San Sebastian Church''']]
In 1621, Don Bernardino Castillo, a generous patron and a devotee of the [[Christianity|Christian]] martyr [[Saint Sebastian]], donated the land which is the current site of  San Sebastian Church for the construction of a church. The original church, made of wood, burned in 1651 during a [[Chinese Filipino#History|Chinese]] uprising. The succeeding structures, which were built of brick, were destroyed by fire and earthquakes in 1859, 1863, and 1880.<ref name=lay7/>

In the 1880s, Esteban Martinez, the parish priest of the ruined church, approached the [[Spain|Spanish]] architect, Genaro Palacios, with a plan to build a fire and earthquake-resistant structure made entirely of [[steel]]. Palacios completed a design that fused [[Earthquake Baroque]] with the [[Gothic Revival architecture|Neo-Gothic]] style.<ref name=lay7/> His final design was said to have been inspired by the famed [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] [[Burgos Cathedral]] in [[Burgos]], [[Spain]].<ref name=lay7/>

===Construction===
The prefabricated steel sections that would compose San Sebastian Church were manufactured in [[Binche]], [[Belgium]].<ref name=whl/> According to the historian [[Ambeth Ocampo]], the knockdown steel parts were ordered from the ''Societe Anonyme des Enterprises de Travaux Publiques'' in Brussels.<ref name=fj>{{cite web |author=Findelle de Jesus |title=The San Sebastian Church -- Gustave Eiffel's Church in the Philippines |url=http://www.artesdelasfilipinas.com/main/archives.php?pid=24 |work=Artes de las Filipinas: A Website in Honor of Philippine Arts and Antiquities |publisher=Artes de las Filipinas |accessdate=2008-04-20 }}</ref> In all, 52 tons of prefabricated steel sections were transported in eight separate shipments from Belgium to the Philippines, the first shipment arriving in 1888.<ref name=lay7/> Belgian engineers supervised the assembly of the church, the first column of which was erected on [[September 11]] [[1890]].<ref>Layug, p. 87-88</ref> The walls were filled with mixed sand, gravel and cement.<ref name=lay8/> The [[stained glass]] windows were imported from the ''Henri Oidtmann Company'', a German stained glass firm, while local artisans assisted in applying the finishing touches of the steel church.<ref name=whl/>

The Church of San Sebastian was raised to the status of a [[minor basilica]] by [[Pope Leo XIII]] on [[June 24]] [[1890]].<ref name=lay8/> Upon its completion the following year, on [[August 16]] [[1891]], Basilica Minore de San Sebastian was consecrated by the Archbishop of Manila, Bernardo Nozaleda.<ref name=lay8/>

===Gustave Eiffel's role===
[[Image:Gustave Eiffel.jpg|thumb|left|120px|[[Gustave Eiffel]] may have been involved in the design of San Sebastian Church.]]
Although this is unconfirmed in the official histories of the church,<ref name=hs> {{cite web|author=Howie Severino |title=An Eiffel in Quiapo |url=http://gmapinoytv.igma.tv/sidetrip/blog/?/archives/82-An-Eiffel-in-Quiapo.html |work=Howie Severino's Sidetrip |publisher=[[GMA Network]] |date=2006-05-30 |accessdate=2008-04-20 }}</ref> it has long been reputed that [[Gustave Eiffel]], the [[France|French]] engineer behind the [[Eiffel Tower]] and the steel structure within the [[Statue of Liberty]], was involved in the design and construction of San Sebastian Church.<ref name=lay/><ref name=hs/><ref name=fj/>

The connection between Eiffel and San Sebastian Church was reportedly confirmed by historian [[Ambeth Ocampo]] while doing research in [[Paris]].<ref name=hs/> Ocampo likewise published a report that in the 1970s, the famed architect [[I. M. Pei]] had visited Manila to confirm reports he had heard that Eiffel had designed an all-steel church in Asia. When Pei inspected San Sebastian Church, he reportedly pronounced that the metal fixtures and overall structure were indeed designed by Eiffel.<ref name=fj/>

Nonetheless, it is said that the official catalogues of Eiffel make possible reference to the design and exportation of a church in Manila in 1875, or thirteen years before construction of San Sebastian Church actually began.<ref name=fj/> If true, this would still not preclude the possibility that Eiffel had designed the metal structure of the church, with Palacios completing the actual design of the entire church.<ref name=fj/>

==Features==
[[Image:SanSebastianChurch.jpg|thumb|250px|A view of the center aisle and main altar of '''Basilica Minore de San Sebastian''']] 
San Sebastian Church is the first and only all-steel church in Asia.<ref name=whl/><ref name=lay8/> It has two openwork towers and steel [[vault (architecture)|vaulting]]. The basilica's central nave is twelve meters from the floor to the dome, and thirty-two meters to the tip of the spires.<ref name=lay8/>

The interior of the church displays groined vaults in the [[Gothic architecture]] style.<ref name=whl/> The steel [[column]]s, walls and [[ceiling]] were painted by Filipino artist Lorenzo Rocha and his students to give off a faux-[[marble]] and [[jasper]] appearance.<ref name=whl/> [[Trompe l'oeil]] paintings were used to decorate the interiors of the church.<ref name=fj/> True to the Gothic revival spirit of the church are its [[confessional]]s, [[pulpit]], [[altar]]s and five [[retablo]]s as designed by Filipino artist Lorenzo Guerrero,<ref>{{cite book|last=Trota Jose|first=Regalado|coauthors=Pacific Asia Museum|title=Images of Faith: Religious Ivory Carvings from the Philippines|publisher=Pacific Asia Museum|date=1990|pages=27|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=-6pWAAAAMAAJ&q=San+Sebastian+Church+manila&dq=San+Sebastian+Church+manila&lr=&pgis=1|accessdate=2008-04-26}}</ref> as well as Rocha. The sculptor Eusebio Garcia carved the statues of holy men and women.<ref>Layug, pp. 88-89.</ref> Six holy water fonts were constructed for the church, each crafted from marble obtained from [[Romblon]].<ref>{{cite journal|last=Institute of Science and Technology|date=1919|title=The Philippine Journal of Science|journal=The Philippine Journal of Science|publisher=Science and Technology Information Institute|pages=88|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=Ku4KjcKDO1YC&q=San+Sebastian+Church+manila&dq=San+Sebastian+Church+manila&lr=&pgis=1|accessdate=2008-04-26}}</ref>

Above the main altar of the chuch is an image of Our Lady of Mount Carmel, given to the church by [[Carmelites|Carmelite sisters]] from [[Mexico City]] in 1617.<ref name=lay8/> The image withstood all the earthquakes and fires which had destroyed previous incarnations of San Sebastian Church, but its [[ivory]] head was stolen in 1975.<ref name=lay8/>

==Preservation==
In recent years, San Sebastian Church has encountered threats to its structural integrity. The steel church has been beset by [[rust]] and [[corrosion]], which the sea breezes from nearby [[Manila Bay]] contribute to.<ref name=hs/> In 1998, San Sebastian Church was placed on the biennial watchlist of the [[World Monuments Fund#World Monuments Watch|100 Most Endangered Sites]] by the [[World Monuments Fund]], though it was not retained in the subsequent watchlists.<ref>{{cite web |title=WMF Past Watch Sites |url=http://wmf.org/watch_past.html |publisher=World Monuments Fund |accessdate=2008-04-21 }}</ref>

San Sebastian Church was a declared National Historical Landmark by [[President of the Philippines|President]] [[Ferdinand Marcos]] through Presidential Decree No. 260 in 1973.<ref name=whl/> State funding was accorded to the church through the [[National Historical Institute]] which undertook restoration of the church in 1982. The Recollect community has likewise expended funds for the church's maintenance and restoration.<ref name=whl/>

On [[May 16]] [[2006]], San Sebastian Church was included in the [[World Heritage Site#Nominating process|Tentative List]] for possible designation as a [[World Heritage Site]], on account of its architectural and historical heritage.<ref name=whl/>
