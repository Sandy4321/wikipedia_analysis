'''Paavo Johannes Nurmi''' ({{Audio|Fi-Paavo_Nurmi.ogg|pronunciation}}) (13 June 1897 <U+2013> 2 October 1973) was a [[Finland|Finnish]] [[middle distance track event|middle]] and [[long-distance track event|long distance]] runner. He was nicknamed as the "[[Flying Finn]]" as he dominated distance running in the early 20th century. Nurmi set 22 official world records at distances between 1,500 metres and 20&nbsp;kilometres, and won a total of nine gold and three silver medals in his twelve events in the [[Olympic Games]]. At his peak, Nurmi was undefeated at distances from 800 m upwards for 121 races. Throughout his 14-year career, he remained unbeaten in cross country events and the 10,000 m.

Born into a worker family, Nurmi left school at the age of 12 to provide for his family. In 1912, he was inspired by the Olympic feats of [[Hannes Kolehmainen]] and began developing a strict training program. Nurmi started to flourish during his military service, setting national records en route to his international debut at the [[1920 Summer Olympics]]. After a silver medal in the 5,000 m, he took gold in the 10,000 m and the cross country events. In 1923, Nurmi became the first, and so far only, runner to hold the mile, the 5,000 m and the 10,000 m world records at the same time. He went on to set new world records for the 1,500 m and the 5,000 m with just an hour between the races, and take gold medals in the distances in less than two hours at the [[1924 Summer Olympics|1924 Olympics]]. Seemingly untouched by the Paris heat wave, Nurmi won all his races and returned home with five gold medals, but embittered, as Finnish officials had refused to enter him for the 10,000 m.

Struggling with injuries and motivational issues after his exhaustive U.S. tour in 1925, Nurmi found his long-time rivals [[Ville Ritola]] and [[Edvin Wide]] ever more serious challengers. At the [[1928 Summer Olympics]], Nurmi recaptured the 10,000 m title but was beaten to the gold in the 5,000 m and the 3,000 m steeplechase. He then turned his attention to longer distances, breaking the world records for events such as the one hour run and the 25-mile marathon. Nurmi intended to end his career on a marathon gold medal, as his idol Kolehmainen had done. In a controversial case that strained Finland<U+2013>Sweden relations and sparked an inter-[[International Association of Athletics Federations|IAAF]] battle, Nurmi was suspended before the 1932 Games by an IAAF council that questioned his amateur status. Two days before the opening ceremonies, the council rejected his entries. Although he was never declared a professional, Nurmi's suspension became definite in 1934 and he retired from running.

Nurmi later coached Finnish runners, raised funds for Finland during the [[Winter War]], and worked as a haberdasher, building contractor and share trader, eventually becoming one of Finland's richest people. In 1952, he was the [[List of people who have lit the Olympic Cauldron|lighter of the Olympic Flame]] at the [[1952 Summer Olympics|Summer Olympics]] in Helsinki. Nurmi's speed and elusive personality spawned nicknames such as the "Phantom Finn", while his achievements, training methods and running style influenced future generations of middle and long distance runners. Nurmi, who rarely ran without a stopwatch in his hand, has been credited for introducing the "even pace" strategy and analytic approach to running, and for making running a major international sport.

At the age of 15, Nurmi rekindled his interest in athletics after being inspired by the performances of [[Hannes Kolehmainen]], who was said to "have run Finland onto the map of the world" at the [[1912 Summer Olympics]].<ref name="Urheilumuseo">{{cite web | title=Paavo Nurmi <U+2013> A biography | work=The Sports Museum of Finland | url=http://www.urheilumuseo.org/paavonurmi/life.htm | accessdate=1 August 2012}}</ref> He bought his first pair of sneakers a few days later.<ref name="Top Distance Runners p. 15"/> Nurmi trained primarily by doing [[cross country running]] in the summers and [[cross country skiing]] in the winters.<ref name="SLU"/> In 1914, Nurmi joined the sports club [[Turun Urheiluliitto]] and won his first race on the 3,000 metres.<ref name="Finnish Literature Society">{{cite web | first=Veli-Matti | last=Autio | title=Nurmi, Paavo (1897<U+2013>1973) | work=[[Finnish Literature Society]] | url=http://www.kansallisbiografia.fi/kb/artikkeli/1786/ | date=12 September 1997 | accessdate=16 August 2012 | language=Finnish}}</ref> Two years later, he revised his training program to include walking, sprints and calisthenics.<ref name="SLU"/> He continued to provide for his family through his new job at the Ab.
