==''Le Trait<U+00E9> des Amateurs''==
''Le Trait<U+00E9> des Amateurs'' is a chess treatise composed, by a "Society of Amateurs" contemporaries of Philidor; who all frequented the [[Caf<U+00E9> de la R<U+00E9>gence]], in Paris. Of these, the strongest players were [[Bernard (chess player)|Bernard]], [[Carlier (chess player)|Carlier]], [[Leger (chess player)|Leger]], and [[Verdoni (chess player)|Verdoni]]. [[Fran<U+00E7>ois-Andr<U+00E9> Danican Philidor|Philidor]], constantly resident in London, took no part in writing the "Trait<U+00E9> des Amateurs;" which in fact embodies many criticisms and comments upon his earlier printed book. [[George Walker (chess player)|George Walker]] in his translation of the ''Trait<U+00E9>'' for the [[Chess Player's Chronicle]] in 1846,<ref>[http://books.google.com/books?id=ry8CAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA17&dq=bernard+carlier+bernard+verdoni+subject:%22chess%22&lr=&as_drrb_is=q&as_minm_is=0&as_miny_is=&as_maxm_is=0&as_maxy_is=&as_brr=1&cd=6#v=onepage&q=bernard%20carlier%20bernard%20verdoni%20subject%3A%22chess%22&f=false G. Walker, The Celebrated Trait<U+00E9> des Amateurs in: ''The Chess Player's Chronicle'', London 1846]</ref> specifies: 

<blockquote>
''"In making up the work before us, it is understood that the great masters above named produced most of their games and examples, by playing them over, experimentally and repeatedly, with each other; consulting upon the moves in committee, and noting down the details and variations contingent upon each result. The natural consequence of this develops itself in the practical character of the Treatise; presenting, indeed, fully as much the complexion of a vast collection of first-rate games, played out, mostly even to the closing Checkmate, as that of a general work on the subject of Chess."''
</blockquote>

The work is divided into six chapters, which are subdivided into sections, games and comments. The first three chapters treat entirely of games, in which odds are supposed to be given, the fourth chapter is devoted to the consideration of even games, the fifth is on the ends of games, and the sixth consists of a selection of critical situations from [[Philipp Stamma|Stamma]]<ref>[http://books.google.com/books?id=4_0UAAAAYAAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=inauthor:%22Philip+Stamma%22&lr=lang_fr&as_drrb_is=q&as_minm_is=0&as_miny_is=&as_maxm_is=0&as_maxy_is=&as_brr=1&cd=2#v=onepage&q=&f=false P. Stamma, Essai sur le jeu des echecs, The Hague 1741]</ref>, upon which [[Domenico Lorenzo Ponziani|Ponziani]]<ref>[http://books.google.com/books?id=pnACAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA170&dq=inauthor:%22Domenico+Lorenzo+Ponziani%22&lr=lang_fr&as_brr=1&cd=4#v=onepage&q=&f=false D. Ponziani, Il giuoco incomparabile degli scacchi, Venice 1812 (1st edition Modena 1769)]</ref> sarcastically remarked: 
<blockquote>
''"i quali sono tutti di Filippo Stamma; quando avrebbero potuto pi<U+00F9> plausibilmente cavarli dal proprio fondo"''<ref>they found it easier to take positions from Stamma than to compose new ones for themselves</ref></blockquote>

From the beginning, the authors distance themselves from [[Fran<U+00E7>ois-Andr<U+00E9> Danican Philidor|Philidor]]'s ''Analyse du jeu des <U+00C9>chec'' <ref>[http://books.google.com/books?id=tJxHAAAAYAAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=inauthor:%22Fran%C3%A7ois+Danican+Philidor%22&lr=lang_fr&as_brr=1&cd=4#v=onepage&q=&f=false A. D. Philidor, Analyse du jeu des <U+00C9>chec, London, 1749]</ref>, arguing that the variations reported by the celebrated French master are more instructive than correct. Nevertheless, the games analyzed in the text can be regarded as typical examples of the understanding of chess during the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] and the group was much closer to [[Fran<U+00E7>ois-Andr<U+00E9> Danican Philidor|Philidor]] than to the Italians [[Ercole del Rio]], [[Giambattista Lolli|Lolli]] or [[Domenico Lorenzo Ponziani|Ponziani]] of the Modenese school, which, in contrast to the French, advocated a free piece play, [[gambit]] openings and tactical complications. Because of its practical orientation, the work was published at the end of the 18th Century; together with the more theoretical textbook of [[Fran<U+00E7>ois-Andr<U+00E9> Danican Philidor|Philidor]].

In contrast, during the [[Romanticism]] the play of the amateurs was considered slow and monotonous<ref>[http://books.google.de/books?id=njZfCOr5qRYC&vq=1&pg=PA108#v=onepage&q=1&f=false Anton Schmid, ''Literatur des Schachspiels'', Wien 1847.]</ref> and indeed also the modern point of view gives greater consideration to the game of the Romantic period than of the Enlightenment (well considering the fact that we have the transcription of many more games of the first period than the latter). The most evident difference between these two ways of playing chess being the respective focus on the dynamic and static factor of the game (giving to the terms ''dynamic'' and ''static'' the meaning popularized by [[Valery Beim]] in his books <ref>V. Beim, Lessons in Chess Strategy, Gambit Publications, 2003</ref><ref>V. Beim, How To Play Dynamic Chess, Gambit Publications, 2004</ref><ref>V. Beim, Paul Morphy: A Modern Perspective, Russell Enterprises, 2006</ref>). There are, however, in the introduction of the ''Trait<U+00E9>'' and along the notes to the games, some important considerations that can be arguably defined very modern. The authors, in fact, stress the concept that at the beginning of the game the forces stand in equilibrium; correct play on both sides maintains this equilibrium and leads to a drawn game, therefore a player can win only as a consequence of an error made by the opponent. From this prospective, there is no such a thing as a winning move and even the most skilled master can do nothing against these ''natural laws'' of the game. This point of view was, later, independently developed by [[Wilhelm Steinitz]]; today, it represents the basis of modern chess theory, but, at the time it was proposed by Steinitz, it was in strong contrast with the Romantic concept of chess. According to this concept, it was the strongest player's higher imagination and combinative power, or, in other words, his [[Will to power|''Wille zur Macht'']], to decide the outcome of the game as explained, for instance, by [[Richard R<U+00E9>ti]]<ref>R. R<U+00E9>ti, Modern Ideas In Chess, 1923</ref>.
The ''Amateurs'', however, also differs from [[Fran<U+00E7>ois-Andr<U+00E9> Danican Philidor|Philidor]]; not on the general idea of the ''natural laws'' of the game, but rather on the evaluation of White's move advantage. According to [[Fran<U+00E7>ois-Andr<U+00E9> Danican Philidor|Philidor]], as reported in the ''Trait<U+00E9>'', in fact, White's initial advantage was enough to guarantee, with perfect play, the win of the first player. The authors of the ''Trait<U+00E9>'', on the other hand, did not agree with him and believed that  the advantage deriving from having the first move would only give, with perfect play, a temporary initiative to the first player, but a game correctly played by both sides, was always destined to be draw.

==''La Soci<U+00E9>t<U+00E9> des Amateurs''==
''La Soci<U+00E9>t<U+00E9> des Amateurs'' was group of an unknown number of chess masters and players at the [[Caf<U+00E9> de la R<U+00E9>gence]], in Paris and authors of the ''Trait<U+00E9> des Amateurs''. Only four masters of the group, considered the strongest, are known: Bernard, Carlier, Leger and Verdoni. 
A part, partially, from Verdoni, who is the only one of the ''Amateurs'' with his own entry in the Oxford Companion to Chess<ref>D. Hooper and K. Whyld, The Oxford Companion to Chess 2nd Ed, Oxford University Press, 1992</ref>, not very much is known about the life of these masters. Their first names, places and dates of birth or deaths (the year of death of Verdoni, tough,  is known) are for instance unknown. They, however, appear periodically in the chess literature of the time and, consequently, it is possible to provide some details on their lives and styles. Concerning their games, several Verdoni's games are known<ref>[http://books.google.com/books?id=Zq9AAAAAcAAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=A+selection+of+games+at+chess,+actually+played+by+Philidor&cd=2#v=onepage&q=&f=false, G. Walker, ''A selection of games at chess, actually played by Philidor and his contemporaries'', London 1835]</ref>, while only one game of Bernard and Carlier playing together and winning against Philidor, who gives to them the advantage of Pawn and Move <ref>[http://www.chessgames.com/perl/chessgame?gid=1327132, Carlier & Bernard vs Fran<U+00E7>ois Andr<U+00E9> Philidor, Paris 1780, 1-0]</ref>, survived. Verdoni, Bernard, Carlier and Leger, although they didn't even approach Philidor's level, were considered the best in the world in the years following death of Philidor [http://batgirl.atspace.com/Deschapelles.html] and, directly or indirectly (since Verdoni after the publication of ''Trait<U+00E9>'' moved to London), have disputed each other the scepter of Philidor's successor. There are of course not records of their games and, consequently, it would be impossible for us to assess the relative strength of these player. [[Alexandre Deschapelles|Deschapelles]], however, reported that Philidor classed [[Legall de Kermeur|Legalle]] as a player on even terms, Verdoni as one to receive pawn for the move, Bernard and Carlier as P and move players <ref>[http://books.google.com/books?id=rJcCAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA115&dq=bernard+carlier&lr=&as_drrb_is=q&as_minm_is=0&as_miny_is=&as_maxm_is=0&as_maxy_is=&as_brr=0&cd=4#v=onepage&q=bernard%20carlier&f=false F. M. Edge, The exploits and triumphs, in Europe, of Paul Morphy, 1859 page 115]</ref>.
    
====Bernard====
Bernard was probably the best chess player at the [[Caf<U+00E9> de la R<U+00E9>gence]] around the end of the 18th century or at least until the arrival of [[Alexandre Deschapelles]] to the world chess scene in 1798. According to George Walker<ref>[http://mark_weeks.tripod.com/chw02b01/chw-2b01.htm G. Walker, Deschapelles The Chess-King in Chess & Chess Player: consisting of Original Stories and Sketches, London 1850]</ref>, [[Alexandre Deschapelles|Deschapelles]] noted:
<blockquote>
''"I acquired chess, in four days! I learned the moves, played with Bernard, who had succeeded Philidor as the sovereign of the board; lost the first day, the second, the third, and beat him even-handed on the fourth; since which time I have never advanced or receded. Chess to me has been, and is, a single idea, which, once acquired, cannot be displaced from its throne, while the intellect remains unimpaired by sickness or age."''
</blockquote>

Although, as already mentioned, only one game of Bernard survived, there is evidence in the literature that his play was somehow more brilliant, which probably means more inclined to tactical complications, than that of the others ''amateurs''<ref>[http://books.google.com/books?id=UCwCAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA236&dq=carlier+and+L%C3%A9ger&lr=&as_drrb_is=q&as_minm_is=0&as_miny_is=&as_maxm_is=0&as_maxy_is=&as_brr=0&cd=1#v=onepage&q=&f=false Chess world, Volume 4, 1869 page 236]</ref>.

====Carlier====
Things are, however, not completely clear because, if some sources indicate Bernard as the strongest player between the death of Philidor and the arrival of Deschapelles, others<ref>[http://books.google.com/books?id=iEvVygxop9EC&pg=PA205&dq=carlier+deschapelles&lr=&cd=15#v=onepage&q=carlier%20deschapelles&f=false Revue de Paris edited by L. D. V<U+00E9>ron, 1838, page 205]</ref> prefer Carlier.
<blockquote>
''"M. Bouncourt est contemporain de Philidor; il n'a jamais jou<U+00E9> avec ce grand artiste, mais il a fait la partie de ses <U+00E9>l<U+00E9>ves, Carlier, Bernard et L<U+00E9>ger. A cette <U+00E9>poque Philidor avait <U+00E9>migr<U+00E9> en Angleterre, ou il est mort en 1795, je crois. Carlier, le plus fort d'entre eux, se retira devant M. Descaplelles, qui n'avait point the rival"''<ref>Mr. Bouncourt is a contemporary of Philidor; he never played with this great artist, but he did with some of his pupils, Carlier, Bernard and Leger. At that time Philidor had emigrated to England, where he died in 1795, I think. Carlier, the strongest of the group surrendered to Mr. Descaplelles, who at this point had not a rival</ref>
</blockquote>
We do not know if Carlier's ''surrender'' is due to a specific event like a match between him and Deschapelles, but we do know that the two men were used to play together and, at a certain stage, they were two ''seeded'' in the chess-life of the French capital:
<blockquote>
''The Gentleman's Mag., July, 1807, contained an account of a series of games played between two committees headed respectively by Deschapelles and Carlier.''<ref>Murray, H. J. R. A History of Chess (London: Oxford University Press, 1913, page 873</ref>
</blockquote>

====Leger====
Other references consider Leger as the successor of Philidor, although roughly of the same strength of Carlier. In Journoud's ''Nouvelle r<U+00E9>gence''<ref>[http://books.google.com/books?pg=PA340&dq=carlier%20and%20leger%20subject%3A%22chess%22&lr=&as_drrb_is=q&as_minm_is=0&as_miny_is=&as_maxm_is=0&as_maxy_is=&cd=3&id=syoCAAAAYAAJ&as_brr=1&output=text Nouvelle r<U+00E9>gence, Volume 1, 1860, page 340]</ref>, for instance, Leger is defined ''"le fameux L<U+00E9>ger, le successeur de Philidor"'', while Carlier is ''"l'antagoniste, le rival de L<U+00E9>ger"''. According to this report the story continues with:
<blockquote>
''"ils ont jou<U+00E9> dix ans ensemble, et pendant ces dix ans, ils n'ont fait que dus parties nulles Enfin, il y a six mois que L<U+00E9>ger eu gagna une: Carlier prit sa revanche le lendemain"''<ref>they played ten years together, and during these ten years, they only did drawn games. Finally, six months ago Leger won a game: Carlier took his revenge the next day</ref>.
</blockquote>

On the French front, therefore, each of the three players had his supporters and probably some rights to consider himself the successor of Philidor. We can also imagine that never there was a kind of 'official' match among them in order to determine, once and for all, who was the strongest player in France. The same article in the ''Nouvelle r<U+00E9>gence'', for example, continues saying that, after the mentioned episode, Carlier and Leger never played together again.
<blockquote>
''"Depuis ce moment, ils respectent assez leur r<U+00E9>putation; il se respectent assez eux-m<U+00EA>mes pour ne plus jouer l'un contre l'autre... Et puis, il y a eu des propos... Des gens mal intentionn<U+00E9>s ont rapport<U+00E9> <U+00E0> Carlier que L<U+00E9>ger s'<U+00E9>tait vant<U+00E9> de lui c<U+00E9>der le trait Oh ! si nous n'avions <U+00E9>touff<U+00E9> l'affaire, elle eurait eu des suites mais elle s'est fort bien pass<U+00E9>e; quoique, depuis ce temps, ils ne se parlent jamais"''<ref>Since that time, they respect enough their reputation; they respected themselves enough to stop playing against each other... And then, there was a problem... Ill-intentioned people reported to Carlier that Leger had boasted that he could have given the move to him. Oh! if we had stifled the case, it could had consequences, but it did not, though, since that time, they never speak again.</ref>
</blockquote>

====Verdoni====
The ''amateur'', who moved to England, however, appears to enjoy wider recognition with regard to its status as best player in the country and, perhaps, in the world. The Oxford Companion to Chess <ref>''ibid.'' The Oxford Companion to Chess,</ref> reports that Verdoni (?-1804), Italian, learned chess only in his middle age and, unusually, yet became a strong master. After Philidor's death (1795), Verdoni was considered, especially in England, one of the strongest players in the world and took Philidor's place as house professional at Parsloe's. He mentored [[Jacob Sarratt]] until he died in 1804. Verdoni was called by [[Johann Jacob L<U+00F6>wenthal|L<U+00F6>wenthal]] "the immediate successor of Philidor upon the English chess-throne"<ref>[http://books.google.com/books?id=LAhBAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA378&dq=verdoni+and+philidor+subject:%22chess%22&lr=&as_brr=1&cd=7#v=onepage&q=verdoni%20and%20philidor%20subject%3A%22chess%22&f=false The Chess player's magazine, Volume 2, 1868]</ref>, but Philidor was clearly superior to him and was used to give to Verdoni the Pawn. Allen and Von der Lasa wrote in ''The life of Philidor'' that Philidor gave indeed the advantage of the Pawn to Verdoni but he received for himself  in exchange the Move<ref>[http://books.google.com/books?id=8RsoAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA146&dq=verdoni+subject:%22chess%22&lr=&as_drrb_is=q&as_minm_is=0&as_miny_is=&as_maxm_is=0&as_maxy_is=&as_brr=1&cd=3#v=onepage&q=verdoni%20subject%3A%22chess%22&f=false G. Allen, T. von Heydebrand und der Lasa, The life of Philidor, musician and chess-player, Philadelphia, 1863]</ref>.

The figure of Verdoni seems ultimately to have, these days, a greater consideration than his colleagues remained in France and is normally described as the strongest player in the world between 1795 (death of Philidor) and 1804 (death of Verdoni). Some pages of Wikipedia [http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verdoni][http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Chess_Championship], for example, indicate unequivocally Verdoni as the unofficial world champion during the so-called ''interregnum'' between Philidor and Deschapelles. An argument often cited to support this choice is that Philidor himself, as reported by Lewis<ref>[http://books.google.com/books?id=o-8UAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA101&dq=verdoni+philidor&lr=lang_en&as_drrb_is=q&as_minm_is=0&as_miny_is=&as_maxm_is=0&as_maxy_is=&as_brr=1&cd=14#v=onepage&q=verdoni%20philidor&f=false, W. Lewis, Letters on Chess, London 1848, page 101]</ref>, used to say "(Verdoni) ''c'est le premier joueur en Europe apres moi."''

However, there are some additional factors to consider. First of all, both Philidor and Verdoni moved to England during the French Revolution and they spent the rest of their lives in this country. Consequently, Philidor was aware of the evolution of the skills of Verdoni, but not of Bernard, Carlier or Leger. Second, the English chess world has always been more documantalist tha the French. British chess players have started much earlier than their colleagues across the Channel to record and annotate their games. The games played by Philidor and his contemporaries were recorded by [[George Atwood|Atwood]] in a manuscript later found and published by [[George Walker (chess player)|Walker]]<ref>''ibid.'' Walker, A selection of...</ref>. Walker himself took care to reported for the benefit of posterity many games played in England at that time and another Walker (Greenwood Walker) transcribed the games of the famous [[La Bourdonnais <U+2013> McDonnell chess matches|McDonnell-La Bourdonnais match]] <ref>[http://books.google.com/books?id=piYCAAAAYAAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=george+walker+la+bourdonnais&cd=1#v=onepage&q=&f=false A. McDonnell, G. Walker, L. C. La Bourdonnais,	
A selection of games at chess actually played in London by the late Alexander McDonnell; London 1836]</ref>. Apparently, in France there was not the same attention and the majority of the games of that period are simply lost. We have many games of Verdoni, but virtually none of Bernard, Carlier or Leger. The survived Philidor's games come from the period when the Frenchman lived in London. There are, moreover, a very few games of Deschapelles and nearly all of them were played, not surprisingly, against English players. Ultimately, there is the possibility that the presumed dominance of Verdoni on the others ''amateurs'' is essentially due to the fact that we have some information on his play, while Bernard, Carlier and Leger are almost fallen into oblivion.
