== History ==
[[File:Hologram.jpg|thumb|upright|left|The hologram on the 50 euro note]]
{{see also|History of the euro}}
The euro was founded on 1 January 1999, when it became the currency of over 300 million people in Europe.<ref name="Introduction"></ref> For the first three years of its existence it was an invisible currency, only used in accountance. Euro cash was not introduced until 1 January 2002, when it replaced the national banknotes and coins of the countries in eurozone 12, such as the [[Irish Pound]] and the [[Austrian schilling]].<ref name="Introduction"></ref>

The changeover period during which the former currencies' notes and coins were exchanged for those of the euro lasted about two months, until 28 February 2002. The official date on which the national currencies ceased to be legal tender varied from member state to member state.<ref name="Introduction">{{cite web|url=http://www.ecb.int/euro/intro/html/index.en.html |title=ECB: Introduction|publisher=ECB|work=ECB}}</ref> The earliest date was in Germany, where the mark officially ceased to be legal tender on 31 December 2001, though the exchange period lasted for two months more. Even after the old currencies ceased to be legal tender, they continued to be accepted by national central banks for periods ranging from ten years to forever.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bancaditalia.it/bancomonete/cambiolire;internal&action=_setlanguage.action?LANGUAGE=en |title=Bank of Italy - Exchange of lira notes and coins|date=13 April 2011|accessdate=14 October 2011|work=Banc d'Italia|publisher=Banc d'Italia}}</ref><ref name="Introduction"></ref>
