'''''The Asti Spumante Code''''' (full title: '''''The Asti Spumante Code: A Parody''''') is a [[2005 in literature|2005]] [[Parody|parody novel]] written by [[Toby Clements]] as a parody of ''[[The Da Vinci Code]]'' by [[Dan Brown]]. It is noteworthy for being among the first works of fiction to parody the [[Dan Brown]] novel (although the first parody was actually ''[[The Va Dinci Cod]]'' by [[Adam Roberts (British writer)|Adam Roberts]]).<ref>http://www.amazon.co.uk/Asti-Spumante-Code-Parody/dp/0751537683</ref><ref>http://www.fantasticfiction.co.uk/c/toby-clements/asti-spumante-code.htm</ref><ref>http://www.iblist.com/book55666.htm</ref>

==Plot==
Due to the detailed nature of the overall story within the novel, the plot has been divided into ''Backstory'' and ''Modern Day'' respectively in order to provide a more coherent timeline for the events depicted in the novel.

===Backstory===
In the 13th century, there once existed a circle of authors and playwrights known as the Order of Psion (a parody of the [[Knights Templar]]), most of whom were females writing under male [[Pen name|pseudonyms]], who once predicted the coming of "the ultimate book" that would render publishers obsolete. The formula for the making of the ultimate book - known as the Asti Spumante Code - is contained within the ''Mure de Paume'' (French: "The Blackberry of the Palm"), otherwise known as "the legendary keystone".<ref>Clements, T. (2005) ''The Asti Spumante Code'' London: Time Warner Books, Pg. 86</ref>

Fearing the consequences of the ultimate book, a group of publishers named ''The English Book Guild'' was established in [[Stevenage]], [[England]] to try to counteract the progresses made by the Order.

===Modern day===
The book itself focuses on [[United States|American]] Prof. James Crack - a professor of "[[Anthropology|Paraliteral Metasymbolist studies]]" - and [[Belgium|Belgian]] Emily Raquin, a "[[Book|biblio]][[Technology|technical]] [[Cryptography|cryptologist]]", as they discover a set of clues left by the deceased Grand Master of the Order of Psion that will ultimately lead to the discovery of the Asti Spumante Code.<ref>Clements, T. (2005) ''The Asti Spumante Code'' London: Time Warner Books, Pg. 73</ref>

However, the two are hindered by the efforts of ''Uxbridge Road Group'', a [[Fanaticism|fanatical]] off-shoot of the English Book Guild situated in [[Brussels]], whose members encourage [[Sadomasochism]] and segregate works of fiction by [[Gender inequality|gender stereotyping]] (e.g.: men read only [[adventure fiction]], women read only [[romance novel]]s), who wish to destroy the Asti Spumante Code before it can be put to use by anyone.<ref>Clements, T. (2005) ''The Asti Spumante Code'' London: Time Warner Books, Pg. 77</ref>
