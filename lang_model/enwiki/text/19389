The '''Gray Mouse Lemur''' (''Microcebus murinus'') is a small [[Strepsirrhini|Strepsirrhine]] [[primate]], found only on the island of [[Madagascar]]. Weighing {{convert|58|to|67|g|oz|lk=off|abbr=off}}, it is the largest [[mouse lemur]], yet smaller than the world's smallest [[monkey]], the [[Pygmy Marmoset]], which ranges between {{convert|85|and|140|g|oz|lk=off|abbr=on}}. Its [[genus]], ''Microcebus'', includes the smallest primates in the world.

The Gray Mouse Lemur is named for its [[mouse]]-like size and coloration. It is known locally (in [[Malagasy language|Malagasy]]) as '''Tsidy''', '''Koitsiky''', '''Titlivaha''', '''Pondiky''', and '''Vakiandri'''.

Like all mouse lemurs, this species is [[Nocturnality|nocturnal]] and [[arboreal]].  It is very active, and although it forages alone, groups of males and females will form sleeping groups and share tree holes during the day.  The Gray Mouse Lemur can be found in several types of forest throughout western and southern Madagascar.  Its diet consists primarily of fruit, insects, flowers, and nectar.

[[Gestation]] lasts approximately 60 days, and typically two young are born.  The offspring are usually independent in two months, and can reproduce after one year.  The Gray Mouse Lemur has a reproductive lifespan of five years, although captive individuals have been reported to live up to 15 years.  Although threatened by [[Slash and burn|slash-and-burn agriculture]] and live capture for the [[exotic pet|pet trade]], wild populations can remain healthy under the right conditions.  It is considered one of Madagascar's most abundant small native mammals.

==Etymology==
The Gray Mouse Lemur is named for its brownish-gray fur and mouse-like size and appearance.  The genus name, ''Microcebus'', derives from the Greek word ''mikros'', meaning small,<ref name="myEtymology_genus">{{cite web | title = ''Microcebus'' | publisher = myEtymology.com | url = http://www.myetymology.com/latin/Microcebus.html | accessdate= 28 July 2009}}</ref> and the Greek word, ''kebos'', meaning monkey.<ref name="myEtymology_genus" /><ref name = "Trapp">{{cite web | title = Literal Translations of Names of Mammalian Taxa | author = Trapp, G. | url = http://www.csus.edu/indiv/l/lancasterw/bio168/MAMMal%20etymology.htm | accessdate = 28 July 2009}}</ref>  The Latin version of ''Kebos'', ''cebus'', is a common suffix used for primates, despite the fact that the Gray Mouse Lemur is a [[lemur]], and not a [[monkey]].  The species name, ''murinus'', is Latin for "gray-mouse-colored" and derives from the Latin word ''mus'', or "mouse."<ref name="myEtymology_species">{{cite web | title = ''murinus'' | publisher = myEtymology.com | url = http://www.myetymology.com/latin/murinus.html | accessdate= 28 July 2009}}</ref>

==Taxonomy==
First described in 1777 by [[John Frederick Miller]], the Gray Mouse Lemur is a [[primate]] and belongs to the suborder [[Strepsirrhini]] and infraorder [[Lemuriformes]].<ref name="msw3" />  Within Lemuriformes, the Gray Mouse Lemur belongs to the family [[Cheirogaleidae]], which contains the [[dwarf lemur]]s and [[mouse lemur]]s.  The Gray Mouse Lemur is a member of the genus ''[[Microcebus]]'', which includes most of the mouse lemurs, including the smallest primates in the world.<ref name="msw3"/><ref name="Mittermeier" /><ref name="Garbutt" /><ref name="Nowak">{{cite book | last = Nowak | first = R.

==Anatomy and physiology==
[[File:Microcebus-murinus.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Gray Mouse Lemur clinging to the side of a tree, looking at camera. Light from the flash reflected back as eyeshine|The [[tapetum lucidum]], responsible for eyeshine, reflects light to enhance night vision.]]
The Gray Mouse Lemur shares many traits with other mouse lemurs, including soft fur, a long tail, long hind limbs, a [[Anatomical terms of location#Dorsal and ventral|dorsal]] stripe down the back (not always distinct), a short snout, rounded skull, prominent eyes,<ref name="Nowak"/> and large, membranous, protruding ears.<ref name="Mittermeier" /><ref name="IUCN Lemurs" /><ref name="Garbutt" /> It has large eyes and a [[tapetum lucidum]] to enhance its vision at night.<ref name="Garbutt" /> The dorsal coat is brownish-gray with various reddish tones, the flanks are light gray to beige, and the [[Anatomical terms of location#Dorsal and ventral|ventral]] fur has discrete dull beige or whitish-beige patches along portions of the belly.  On the rounded face, there is a pale white patch above the nose and between the eyes; some individuals have dark orbital markings. The furred portions of the hands and feet are off-white.<ref name="Mittermeier" />

The Gray Mouse Lemur is one of the smallest primates in the world, yet it is also the largest mouse lemur.<ref name="Garbutt">{{cite book | last = Garbutt | first = N. | title = Mammals of Madagascar, A Complete Guide | page = 86&ndash;88 | publisher = [[A & C Black]] | year = 2007 | isbn = 978-0-300-12550-4}}</ref>  Its total length is {{convert|25|to|28|cm|in|lk=off|abbr=on}}, with a head-body length of {{convert|12|to|14|cm|in|lk=off|abbr=on}} and a [[tail]] length of {{convert|13|to|14.5|cm|in|lk=off|abbr=on}}.<ref name="Mittermeier" />  The average weight for this species is {{convert|60|g|oz|lk=off|abbr=on}},<ref name="Garbutt" /> with ranges of {{convert|58|and|67|g|oz|lk=off|abbr=on}}<ref name="Mittermeier" /> and {{convert|40|and|70|g|oz|lk=off|abbr=on}}<ref name="Garbutt" /> reported.  This is smaller than the world's smallest [[monkey]], the Pygmy Marmoset, which ranges between {{convert|85|and|140|g|oz|lk=off|abbr=on}}.<ref name="Nowak" />  Weight varies by season, with both sexes building fat reserves, up to 35% of their body weight, in the tail and hind legs prior to the dry season and periods of [[estivation]].<ref name="Garbutt" />
<br clear="all" />

==Ecology== 
Like all other members of its [[Family (biology)|family]], [[Cheirogaleidae]], the Gray Mouse Lemur is [[Nocturnality|nocturnal]] and [[arboreal]]. It inhabits lowland tropical dry forest, sub-arid thorn scrub, [[gallery forest]], [[Madagascar spiny thickets|spiny forest]], eastern [[littoral forest]], [[Madagascar dry deciduous forests|dry deciduous forest]]s, semi-humid deciduous, moist lowland forest, transitional forest, and [[secondary forest]]s or degraded forests (including plantations) all ranging up to {{convert|800|m|ft|lk=off|abbr=on}} above sea level.<ref name="Mittermeier" /><ref name="IUCN Lemurs" /><ref name="Garbutt" />  The species is more common in secondary forest than in primary forest, particularly bush and scrub habitat, where it occupies a "fine branch" [[Ecological niche|niche]], restricting the vertical range to fine branches, fine terminal supports, [[Liana|lianes]] and dense foliage.<ref name="IUCN Lemurs" /><ref name="Garbutt" /><ref name="Sussman">{{cite book | title=Primate Ecology and Social Structure Volume 1: Lorises, Lemurs and Tarsiers| author=Sussman, R. | page=107<U+2013>148 | year=1999 | publisher=Pearson Custom Publishing | isbn=0-536-02256-9}}</ref> These lemurs are usually seen on branches less than {{convert|5|cm|in|lk=off|abbr=on}} in diameter.<ref name="Sussman" /> The Gray Mouse Lemur tends to prefer lower levels of the forest and the [[understory]], where branches and vegetation are dense.<ref name="Garbutt" />

[[File:Stavenn Microcebus murinus 00.jpg|thumb|alt=Preserved specimen perched on a green plastic branch segment, tail in the air and one front foot lifted as if walking|[[Specimen (biology)|Specimen]] displayed at the [[American Museum of Natural History]]]]
In secondary forest, it is generally observed at {{convert|0|to|10|m|ft|lk=off|abbr=on}} above ground, yet {{convert|15|to|30|m|ft|lk=off|abbr=on|sigfig=1}} in the [[Canopy (ecology)|canopy]] of [[Old-growth forest|primary forest]].<ref name="IUCN Lemurs" /><ref name="Sussman" /> Studies have found that the species can spend as much as 40% of its time below {{convert|3|m|ft|lk=off|abbr=on|sigfig=1}}, with 70% of its time spent at this level during the end of the dry season, when plant food is limited and insects compose a larger percentage of the diet.<ref name="Sussman" /> The species is more numerous in spiny forest, such as the [[Andohahela National Park|Andohahela Special Reserve]], than in the gallery forest, preferring drier, littoral forest, whereas the [[Brown Mouse Lemur]] prefers inland rain forest.<ref name="IUCN Lemurs" />

The limits of the distribution are poorly understood.  It is believed to range from the [[Onilahy River]] or [[Lake Tsimanampetsotsa]] in the south to [[Ankarafantsika National Park]] in the north<ref name="Mittermeier" /><ref name="Garbutt" /> There is also an isolated and disjointed population in the southeastern part of the island, near [[T<U+00F4>lanaro]] and the Andohahela National Park, up to the [[Mandena Conservation Zone]].<ref name="Mittermeier" /><ref name="Garbutt" /> Individuals tend to occupy small home ranges of {{convert|1|to|2|ha|acre|lk=off|abbr=on}}.<ref name="Garbutt" />  The Gray Mouse Lemur is also [[Sympatric speciation|sympatric]] with the [[Reddish-gray Mouse Lemur]], [[Golden-brown Mouse Lemur]], [[Madame Berthe's Mouse Lemur]], and several other [[Cheirogaleidae|cheirogaleid]] lemurs.<ref name="Mittermeier" />

The Gray Mouse Lemur can reach high population densities up to several hundred individuals per square kilometer<ref name="IUCN Lemurs" /><ref name="Garbutt" /> (up to 167 individuals/km<sup>2</sup> at [[Ankarafantsika National Park]] to 712 individuals/km<sup>2</sup> at [[Kirindy Mitea National Park]]).<ref name="iucn" /> This abundance is not uniform and tends to concentrate in "population nuclei"',<ref name="Garbutt" /> suggesting that it is difficult to accurately estimate population densities when extrapolating from a small area (from various studies) to a large area. The difficulty in finding individuals during some times of the year, particularly during the dry periods, can further complicate the problem of estimating population densities.<ref name="IUCN Lemurs" />

Mouse lemurs are [[Omnivore|omnivorous]], favoring fruit and insects for the bulk of its diet. The Gray Mouse Lemur may even come down to the ground to catch insect prey,<ref name="IUCN Lemurs" /> although it will quickly return to the protective cover of the [[understory]] to consume its catch.<ref name="Sussman" />  Nectar is also a part of the Gray Mouse Lemur's diet, making it a potential [[pollinator]] for local plant species.<ref name="Garbutt" />

===Predation===
The most significant [[Predation|predator]]s of the Gray Mouse Lemur are the [[Madagascar Long-eared Owl]] and [[Barn Owl]].<ref name="Mittermeier" /><ref name="Sussman" />  Studies in [[Beza Mahafaly Reserve]] and Kirindy Mitea National Park indicate an approximate predation rate of 25% (percent population taken by predator per year), the highest known for any primate species.  However, given its high reproductive potential, predation does not appear to drastically affect its populations.<ref name="Sussman" />  Other raptors, such as the [[Henst's Goshawk]], and owls prey upon this species. [[Snake]]s, such as ''[[Ichythcyphys miniatus]]'' (a native [[colubrid]] snake), [[Boa manditra|Madagascar tree boa]], as well as mammalian predators, such as the [[Ring-tailed Mongoose]], [[Narrow-striped Mongoose]], [[Fossa (animal)|Fossa]], and [[dog|domestic dog]]s are also prey upon the Gray Mouse Lemur.<ref name="Garbutt" /><ref name="Sussman" />  Mammalian predators often discover tree holes serving as nests and then enlarge the opening in order to obtain and eat the occupant, resulting in strong selective pressure affecting the choice of nest hole opening diameter and deepness.<ref name="Sussman" />

Due to its non-gregarious nature, the Gray Mouse Lemur, like other nocturnal lemurs, defends itself from predators using strategies that do not involve direct defense or social facilitation.<ref name="Sussman" />  First, individuals take shelter inside tree holes within their range during the day when they are most vulnerable, sometimes forming nests.  Individuals use between three and nine different tree holes within their range, yet stay within one particular hole for up to five consecutive days.<ref name="Mittermeier" /><ref name="Garbutt" /> Tree hollows tend to be preferred, but spherical constructions made of leaves are also common. Nests are usually found in tree holes with a minimum diameter of {{convert|5|cm|in|lk=off|abbr=on}}, with a median of {{convert|13|cm|in|lk=off|abbr=on}}, suggesting that this range in diameter of tree holes my be crucial for maintaining a healthy habitat for this species.<ref name="IUCN Lemurs" /> The Gray Mouse Lemur also spends most of its time in dense vegetation, limiting its visibility and accessibility.  Furthermore, it has a high reproductive rate to counter losses to predation.<ref name="Sussman" />

==Behavior==
The Gray Mouse Lemur is nocturnal, sleeping during the day in tree holes lined with leaf-litter or purpose-built spherical nests constructed from dead leaves, moss and twigs.<ref name="Garbutt" />  It usually forages alone at night, but may sleep in groups during the day, the composition of which depends on gender and season.<ref name="IUCN Lemurs" />  Tree holes can be shared with up to 15 other individuals,<ref name="Garbutt" /> although males tend to sleep alone while females tend to share nests.<ref name="Mittermeier" />

All mouse lemurs are agile and highly active at night,<ref name="Nowak"/>, often scurrying like mice and leaping over {{convert|3|m|ft|lk=off|abbr=on}},<ref name="Sussman" /> using the tail as a balancing organ.<ref name="Nowak"/> When moving among the terminal branches of bushes and trees, they grip using all four feet and move with four legs.<ref name="Nowak"/><ref name="Sussman" />  When on the ground, either to catch insects or cross short open areas, mouse lemurs hop like a frog.<ref name="Nowak"/>

Foraging behavior is often slow, with height and direction changing continuously. Predation of insects occurs primarily on the ground.<ref name="IUCN Lemurs" /> Before descending, the [[Pinna (anatomy)|ear pinna]]e move alternately to help pinpoint the precise location of their prey.  Insects are captured during a rapid dash across the leaf litter and are transported by mouth up into the relative safety of the branches.<ref name="Sussman" />

Activity patterns differ noticeably between populations and sexes.  At Ankarafantsika National Park, males and females exhibit daily, rather than seasonal [[torpor]].<ref name="Mittermeier" />  At Kirindy Forest, both sexes share the same daily torpor, yet during the dry season (April/May through September/October), females become completely inactive for several weeks or up to five months to conserve energy and reduce predation.  Males, however, rarely remain inactive for more than a few days and become extremely active before the females revive from torpor, allowing them to establish hierarchies and territories for the breeding season.<ref name="Mittermeier" /><ref name="Garbutt" />  This pattern of seasonal versus daily torpor may relate to the seasonality of the region.<ref name="Sussman" />

During torpor, the Gray Mouse Lemur's metabolic rate slows and its body temperature drops to the ambient temperature, as low as {{convert|7|<U+00B0>C|<U+00B0>F|lk=off|abbr=on}}.  From May though August, during the cooler winter months, the species selects tree holes closer to ground level, where ambient temperatures remain more stable.  This allows them to remain in torpor longer, conserving metabolic resources.<ref name="Garbutt" />

===Diet===
The Gray Mouse Lemur is [[omnivore|omnivorous]],<ref name="Garbutt" /> feeding primarily on fruit and [[invertebrate]]s.<ref name="IUCN Lemurs" /><ref name="Sussman" />  Local populations appear to specialize on locally available fruit.  At both [[Marosalaza]] and Mandena, [[beetle]]s are the primary insect prey, although moths, [[mantis|praying mantid]]s, [[Fulgoridae|fulgorid bugs]], crickets, cockroaches, and spiders are also eaten.  Less than half the diet consists of insects, with fruit making up a slightly larger fraction.<ref name="Sussman" /> This lemur also consumes flowers, gums and nectar from [[Euphorbia]] and [[Terminalia (plant)|Terminalia]] trees, leaves (''[[Uapaca]]'' sp.), [[exudate]]s ([[Hemiptera|Homopteran]] larvae secretions), and small [[vertebrate]]s such as [[tree frog]]s, [[gecko]]s, and [[chameleon]]s.<ref name="Mittermeier" /><ref name="IUCN Lemurs" /><ref name="Garbutt" />

===Social systems===
The Gray Mouse Lemur is described as solitary but social,<ref name="Sussman" /> foraging alone at night, but frequently sleeping in groups during the day.<ref name="IUCN Lemurs" /><ref name="Garbutt" />  This varies by gender, season, and location.  Females tend to share nests with other females and their offspring, whereas males tend to sleep alone or in pairs outside of the breeding season.<ref name="Mittermeier" /><ref name="IUCN Lemurs" /><ref name="Garbutt" />  Groups of females sharing a nest can be relatively stable, consisting of two to nine individuals, although a male may be found with a group of females outside the breeding season.<ref name="Nowak"/>  During the breeding season (September through October), males and females may sleep in the same tree hole.<ref name="Garbutt" /><ref name="Nowak"/>  Mixed sex groups can be common at this time, with single males sharing nest sites with three to seven females or single females sharing nest sites with one to three males.<ref name="IUCN Lemurs" />

Research has shown that home ranges for the Gray Mouse Lemur are likely to be small, possibly less than {{convert|50|m|ft|lk=off|abbr=on}}.<ref name="IUCN Lemurs" /> Males typically travel further at night and have home ranges that are twice as large as those of females,<ref name="Mittermeier" /><ref name="IUCN Lemurs" /> often overlapping with one another, and always overlapping with at least one female's home range.<ref name="Garbutt" /><ref name="Nowak"/>  Male home ranges increase threefold during the breeding season,<ref name="Mittermeier" /><ref name="Garbutt" /> and ranges are scent-marked with urine and feces.<ref name="Nowak"/>

Female home ranges overlap less than those of males, although localized concentrations, or "population nuclei" tend to form in some areas, where the sex ratio favors females to males by three or four to one at the nucleus core.<ref name="IUCN Lemurs" />  Genetic studies indicate that females arrange themselves spatially in clusters ("population nuclei") of related individuals, while males tend to emigrate from their [[natal group]].<ref name="Mittermeier" />

===Communication===
Vocalizations and [[Olfaction|scent]] are the primarily modes of communication within this species.  Home ranges are [[Spraying (animal behavior)|scent mark]]ed with urine and feces.<ref name="Nowak"/>  Vocalizations are complex and very high-pitched (ranging from 10 to 36 kHz), sometimes beyond the range of human hearing (0.02 to 20 kHz).<ref name="Nowak"/><ref name="EncycMammals">{{cite encyclopedia | last = Macdonald | first = D. | authorlink = David W. Macdonald | title = Primates | encyclopedia = The Encyclopedia of Mammals | pages = 319 | publisher = The Brown Reference Group plc | year = 2006 | isbn = 0-681-45659-0}}</ref>  These include calls for seeking contact, mating, distant communication, alarm, and distress.<ref name="Nowak"/>

As with other social mammals, the calls reveal the sex and identity of the individual.  Dialects have also been detected between communities.  The male trill call, part of the male mating display, is very like a bird song in terms of its ordered sequence of broadband frequency modulated syllables, ranging between 13 to 35 kHz in pitch and lasting 0.3 to 0.9 seconds, repeating up to 1.5 times per minute.  Each locality has its own theme of trill calls that is distinct from those of neighboring communities, and resident males produce individually distinct trill calls within that theme.  These calls are not genetically programmed.  During play, young males produce early attempts at the trill call which show high degrees of variability.  Research has shown that the male mouse lemurs consciously manipulate the dialect to resemble those of their neighbors, when transferred from their home to a new neighborhood.  This may reduce aggression and foster social acceptance for emigrant males as they transfer from their natal group upon maturity.<ref name="EncycMammals" />

===Breeding and reproduction===
The mating system is described as multi-male/multi-female.  Males establish [[Dominance hierarchy|dominance hierarchies]] prior to the mating season, however, some studies in the wild have shown no male aggression or visible competition for receptive females.  Males in captivity become highly aggressive and form strict dominance hierarchies. These captive males may show the highest plasma [[testosterone]] levels found in mammals, and even the odor of a dominant male can lower the testosterone levels and sexually inhibit a subordinate male.<ref name="Sussman" />

The females are receptive for 45 to 55 days between September and October, with [[Estrous cycle|estrus]] lasting 1 to 5 days.<ref name="Mittermeier" /><ref name="Garbutt" /><ref name="Nowak"/>  During the breeding season, male [[Testicle|testes]] increase significantly in size.<ref name="Mittermeier" />  Females advertise estrus by distinctive high-frequency calls and scent-marking.<ref name="Garbutt" />  Gestation lasts 54 to 68 days,<ref name="Nowak"/> averaging 60 days, typically resulting in 2 or 3 offspring weighing {{convert|5|g|oz|lk=off|abbr=on}} each.<ref name="Mittermeier" /><ref name="IUCN Lemurs" /><ref name="Garbutt" /><ref name="Nowak"/>

Infants are born in a leaf nest or tree hole in November prior to the onset of the rainy season.<ref name="Garbutt" />  Weaning occurs after 25 days,<ref name="Nowak"/> and the infants are either left in the nest or carried in the mother's mouth and deposited on a branch while she forages.<ref name="Garbutt" /><ref name="Sussman" />  Infant mouse lemurs do not cling to the mother's fur.  Independence is attained in 2 months,<ref name="IUCN Lemurs" /><ref name="Garbutt" /> while sexual maturity is reached at 10 to 29 months in females and 7 to 19 months in males.<ref name="IUCN Lemurs" /><ref name="Nowak"/>  Closely related females remain loosely associated after maturation (female [[philopatry]]), whereas males disperse from their natal area.  In the wild, the Gray Mouse Lemur's reproductive lifespan is no more than 5 years,<ref name="Garbutt" /> although captive specimens have reportedly lived as long as 15 years and 5 months.<ref name="Nowak"/>

==Conservation status==
The Gray Mouse Lemur was listed in Appendix 1 by the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) in 1975,<ref name="CITES_old">{{cite web | date = 2009 | title = UNEP-WCMC Species Database: CITES-Listed Species, ''Microcebus murinus'' | publisher = UNEP-WCMC | url = http://www.unep-wcmc.org/isdb/CITES/Taxonomy/tax-species-result.cfm/isdb/CITES/Taxonomy/tax-species-result.cfm?displaylanguage=eng&Genus=%25Microcebus%25&source=animals&Species=murinus | accessdate = 29 March 2009}}</ref> declaring it as threatened with extinction and prohibiting international trade of specimens except for non-commercial use, such as scientific research.<ref name="CITES_appendices">{{cite web | title = The CITES Appendices | publisher = CITES | url = http://www.cites.org/eng/app/index.shtml | accessdate = 28 July 2009}}</ref>  As of 2009, the species was no longer listed under Appendix 1.<ref name="CITES">{{cite web | title = Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora: Appendices I, II and III | publisher = CITES | url = http://www.cites.org/eng/app/e-appendices.pdf | accessdate = 28 July 2009}}</ref> The 2008 [[International Union for Conservation of Nature]] (IUCN) Red List assessment lists it as a species of ''Least Concern'' (LC) with a decreasing population trend.  Its greatest threats are habitat loss from [[Slash and burn|slash-and-burn agriculture]] and cattle-grazing, as well as live capture for the local [[exotic pet|pet trade]] in the northern and southern parts of its range.  Although this species inhabits secondary forests, studies have shown that decreased habitat quality adversely affects its populations since fewer tree holes offer fewer opportunities to conserve energy, increasing stress and mortality.<ref name="iucn" /><ref name="Mittermeier" />  Studies in the late 1960's and 1970's showed that heavy logging between 1968 and 1970 seemed to result in decreased body weight, the use of smaller trees for nesting sites, and a smaller maximum female nesting group size (down to 7 from 15).<ref name="IUCN Lemurs" />

The Gray Mouse Lemur is considered to be one of Madagascar's most abundant small native mammals, found in seven national parks, five special reserves, the [[Berenty Reserve|Berenty Private Reserve]], and other privately-protected forests within the Mandena Conservation Zone.<ref name="Mittermeier" />

This species of mouse lemur breeds very well in captivity, although it is not commonly displayed in zoos like some larger, [[diurnality|diurnal]] lemurs.  In 1989, more than 370 individuals were housed by 14 [[International Species Information System]] (ISIS) and non-ISIS institutions across the United States and Europe, 97% of which were captive born.<ref name="IUCN Lemurs" />  In March 2009, 167 were registered at 29 ISIS institutions, including the [[Duke Lemur Center]].<ref name="iucn" /><ref name="ISIS">{{cite web | date = 2009 | title = ISIS Species Holdings, ''Microcebus murinus'' | publisher = International Species Information System (ISIS) | url = http://app.isis.org/abstracts/abs.asp | accessdate = 25 March 2009}}</ref>
