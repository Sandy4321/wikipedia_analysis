'''''Jaws''''' is a 1975 American [[thriller (genre)|thriller film]] directed by [[Steven Spielberg]] and based on [[Peter Benchley]]'s [[Jaws (novel)|novel of the same name]]. The prototypical summer [[Blockbuster (entertainment)|blockbuster]], its release is regarded as a watershed moment in motion picture history. In the story, a giant man-eating [[great white shark]] attacks beachgoers on Amity Island, a fictional summer resort town, prompting the local police chief to hunt the shark with the help of a [[Marine biology|marine biologist]] and a professional shark hunter. [[Roy Scheider]] stars as police chief Martin Brody, [[Richard Dreyfuss]] as oceanographer Matt Hooper, [[Robert Shaw (actor)|Robert Shaw]] as shark hunter Quint, [[Murray Hamilton]] as the mayor of Amity Island, and [[Lorraine Gary]] as Brody's wife, Ellen. The screenplay is credited to both Benchley, who wrote the first drafts, and actor-writer [[Carl Gottlieb]], who rewrote the script during [[principal photography]].

Shot mostly on location on [[Martha's Vineyard]], [[Massachusetts]], the film had a troubled production, going over budget and past schedule. As the art department's mechanical sharks suffered many malfunctions, Spielberg decided to mostly suggest the animal's presence, using representative props and an ominous, minimalistic theme created by composer [[John Williams]] to indicate the shark's impending appearances. Spielberg and others have compared this suggestive approach to that of classic thriller director [[Alfred Hitchcock]]. [[Universal Pictures]] gave the film what was then an exceptionally [[wide release]] for a [[major film studio|major studio]] picture, over 450 screens, accompanied by an extensive marketing campaign with a heavy emphasis on television spots and tie-in merchandise. 

Generally well received by critics, ''Jaws'' became the highest-grossing film in history at the time. It won several awards for its soundtrack and editing, and it is often cited as one of [[List of films considered the best|the greatest films of all time]]. Along with 1977's ''[[Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope|Star Wars]]'', ''Jaws'' was pivotal in establishing the modern Hollywood business model, which revolves around blockbuster action and adventure pictures with simple "[[high-concept]]" premises that are released in the summer at thousands of theaters and supported by heavy advertising. It was followed by [[Jaws (franchise)|three sequels]], none with the participation of Spielberg or Benchley, and many imitative thrillers.

==Plot==
A young woman named Chrissie Watkins leaves an evening beach party on [[New England]]'s Amity Island to go [[skinny dipping]] in the Atlantic Ocean, only to be dragged back and forth and then pulled under the water. Amity's police chief, Martin Brody, is notified that Chrissie is missing, and Deputy Hendricks finds her remains on the beach. The medical examiner informs Brody that she was killed by a shark. Brody plans to close the beaches but is overruled by Mayor Larry Vaughan, who fears that reports of a shark attack will ruin the summer tourist season, the town's primary source of income. The medical examiner consequently attributes the death to a boating accident. Brody reluctantly goes along with the explanation.

A short time later, a boy is killed by a shark at the beach. The boy's mother places a bounty on the shark, sparking an amateur shark-hunting frenzy and attracting the attention of local professional shark hunter Quint. Marine biologist Matt Hooper examines Chrissie's remains and determines that she was unquestionably killed by a shark, not a boat.

A large [[tiger shark]] is caught by fishermen, leading the townspeople to believe the problem is solved, but Hooper is unconvinced and asks to examine its stomach contents. Vaughan refuses to make the autopsy public, so Brody and Hooper return after dark and discover the dead shark does not contain human remains. They come across the half-sunken wreckage of a boat belonging to local fisherman Ben Gardner. Hooper explores the vessel underwater and discovers a sizable shark's tooth protruding from the damaged [[Hull (watercraft)|hull]] before he is startled by Gardner's remains. Vaughan refuses to close the beaches, and on the Fourth of July many tourists arrive. A children's prank causes panic at the main beach while the shark enters a nearby [[estuary]], killing a man; Brody's son, who witnesses the attack, goes into shock. Brody persuades Vaughan to hire Quint, who reluctantly allows Hooper to join the hunt along with Brody. The three set out to catch and kill the shark aboard Quint's vessel, the ''Orca''.

Brody is given the task of laying a [[Chumming|chum]] line while Quint uses fishing tackle to try to hook the shark. An enormous [[great white shark]] looms up behind the boat, and the trio watch it circle the ''Orca'' while Hooper takes pictures for research. Quint harpoons it with a line attached to a flotation barrel, but the shark pulls the barrel under and disappears.

The men retire to the boat's cabin, where Quint relates his experience with sharks as a survivor of the sinking of the warship {{USS|Indianapolis|CA-35|6}} during the [[War in the Pacific]] in 1945. The shark reappears, damaging the boat's hull before slipping away. In the morning, Brody attempts to call the [[United States Coast Guard|Coast Guard]], but Quint destroys the radio. After a long chase, Quint harpoons another barrel to the shark. The men tie it to the stern, but the shark drags the boat backward, forcing water onto the deck and flooding the engine. Quint heads toward shore, hoping to draw it into shallow waters and [[Shark#Respiration|suffocate]] it. In his obsession to kill the shark, Quint overtaxes and stalls the ''Orca'''s engines.

With the boat immobilized, the trio attempt a desperate approach: Hooper dons [[Scuba set|scuba gear]] and enters the ocean inside a [[shark proof cage]], aiming to stab the shark with a hypodermic spear filled with [[strychnine]]. When the shark attacks the cage, Hooper drops his spear but manages to escape to the seabed. As Quint and Brody raise the mangled cage, the shark leaps onto the boat, crushing the [[Transom (nautical)|transom]]. Quint slips down the deck into the shark's mouth and is eaten alive. When the shark attacks Brody, he shoves a pressurized scuba tank into its mouth, then takes Quint's rifle and climbs the sinking ''Orca''{{'}}s mast. Brody shoots at the scuba tank, blowing it and the shark to pieces. Hooper emerges, and the two make rafts out of the ''Orca''{{'}}s remains to paddle back to Amity Island.

==Production==
===Development===
[[Richard D. Zanuck]] and [[David Brown (producer)|David Brown]], producers at [[Universal Pictures]], independently heard about Peter Benchley's novel ''[[Jaws (novel)|Jaws]]''. Brown came across it in the fiction department of the ''[[Cosmopolitan (magazine)|Cosmopolitan]]'' lifestyle magazine, then edited by his wife, [[Helen Gurley Brown]]. A small card written by the magazine's book editor gave a detailed description of the plot, concluding with the comment "might make a good movie".<ref name="Prigg<U+00E9>6">{{harvnb|Prigg<U+00E9>|2004|p=6}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Scanlon|2009|p=197}}</ref> The producers each read the book over the course of a single night and agreed the next morning that it was "the most exciting thing that they had ever read" and that they wanted to produce a film version, although they were unsure how it would be accomplished.<ref name=jawschap1>{{cite video|first=Laurent|last=Bouzereau|title=A Look Inside Jaws|location=''Jaws'': 30th Anniversary Edition DVD (2005)|year=1995|publisher=Universal Home Video|trans_title="From Novel to Script"}}</ref> They purchased the movie rights in 1973, before the book's publication, for approximately $175,000.<ref name="Brode 50">{{harvnb|Brode|1995|p=50}}</ref> Brown claimed that had they read the book twice, they would never have made the film because they would have realized how difficult it would be to execute certain sequences.<ref name="McBride 231">{{harvnb|McBride|1999|p=231}}</ref> 

To direct, Zanuck and Brown first considered veteran filmmaker [[John Sturges]]<U+2014>whose r<U+00E9>sum<U+00E9> included another maritime adventure, ''[[The Old Man and the Sea (1958 film)|The Old Man and the Sea]]''<U+2014>before offering the job to [[Dick Richards]], whose directorial debut, ''[[The Culpepper Cattle Co.]]'' had come out the previous year.<ref name="McBride232">{{harvnb|McBride|1999|p=232}}</ref> However, they grew irritated by Richards's habit of describing the shark as a whale and soon dropped him from the project.<ref name="McBride232"/> Meanwhile, [[Steven Spielberg]] very much wanted the job. The 26-year-old had just directed his first theatrical film, ''[[The Sugarland Express]]'', for Zanuck and Brown. At the end of a meeting in their office, Spielberg noticed their copy of the still-unpublished Benchley novel, and after reading it was immediately captivated.<ref name="Brode 50"/> He later observed that it was similar to his 1971 television film ''[[Duel (1971 film)|Duel]]'' in that both deal with "these leviathans targeting [[everyman|everymen]]."<ref name=jawschap1/> After Richards's departure, the producers signed Spielberg to direct in June 1973, before the release of ''The Sugarland Express''.<ref name="McBride232"/> 

Before production began, however, Spielberg grew reluctant to continue with ''Jaws'', in fear of becoming [[Typecasting (acting)|typecast]] as the "truck and shark director".<ref name=biskind264/> He wanted to move over to [[20th Century Fox]]'s ''[[Lucky Lady]]'' instead, but Universal exercised its right under its contract with the director to veto his departure.<ref name="McBride240">{{harvnb|McBride|1999|p=240}}</ref> Brown helped convince Spielberg to stick with the project, saying that "after [''Jaws''], you can make all the films you want".<ref name=biskind264/> The film was given an estimated budget of $3.5&nbsp;million and a shooting schedule of 55&nbsp;days. [[Principal photography]] was set to begin in May 1974. Universal wanted the shoot to finish by the end of June, when the major studios' contract with the [[Screen Actors Guild]] was due to expire, to avoid any disruptions due to a potential strike.<ref>{{harvnb|Gottlieb|2005|p=52}}</ref>

===Writing===
For the adaptation, Spielberg wanted to stick with the novel's basic concept, while removing Benchley's many [[subplot]]s.<ref name="Brode 50"/> He declared that his favorite part of the book was the shark hunt on the last 120&nbsp;pages, and told Zanuck when he accepted the job, "I'd like to do the picture if I could change the first two acts and base the first two acts on original screenplay material, and then be very true to the book for the last third."{{sfn|Friedman|Notbohm|2000|p=8}} When the producers purchased the rights to his novel, they promised Benchley that he could write the first draft of the [[screenplay]]. Overall, he wrote three drafts before the script was turned over to other writers,<ref name="Brode 50"/> claiming to Spielberg that "I'm written out on this, and that's the best I can do" as he delivered his final script.<ref name=inside_story/> During the film's production, Benchley agreed to return and play a small onscreen role as a reporter.<ref name="jawschap3"/> One of his changes was to remove the novel's adulterous affair between Ellen Brody and Matt Hooper, at the suggestion of Spielberg, who feared it would compromise the camaraderie between the men on the ''Orca''.<ref name=int11/>

Spielberg, who felt that the characters in Benchley's script were still unlikable, invited the young screenwriter [[John Byrum]] to do a rewrite, but he turned down the offer.<ref name=biskind264>{{harvnb|Biskind|1998|p=264}}</ref>
''[[Columbo (TV series)|Columbo]]'' creators [[William Link]] and [[Richard Levinson]] also declined Spielberg's invitation.<ref name="McBride238">{{harvnb|McBride|1999|p=238}}</ref> [[Tony Award|Tony]] and [[Pulitzer Prize]]<U+2013>winning playwright [[Howard Sackler]] was in Los Angeles when the filmmakers began looking for another writer and offered to do an uncredited rewrite; since the producers and Spielberg were unhappy with Benchley's drafts, they quickly agreed.<ref name=jawschap1/> 

As Spielberg wanted "some levity" in ''Jaws'', considering some jokes would avoid making it "a dark sea hunt", he turned to his friend [[Carl Gottlieb]], a comedy writer-actor who at the time worked on the sitcom ''[[The Odd Couple (TV series)|The Odd Couple]]''.<ref name=inside_story/> Spielberg sent Gottlieb a script, asking what the writer would change and the role he would be interested in performing.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.omaha.com/article/20100520/ENTERTAINMENT/705209910|title=Bob's Take: <U+2018>Jaws<U+2019> script doctor ruthless to character played by him|first=Bob|last=Fischbach|work=[[Omaha World-Herald]]|date=2010-05-20|accessdate=2012-03-06}}</ref> Gottlieb sent Spielberg three pages of notes, and picked the part of Meadows, the politically connected editor of the local paper. He passed the audition one week before Spielberg took him to meet the producers regarding a writing job.<ref name=Baer198/>

While the deal was initially for a "one-week dialogue polish", Gottlieb eventually became the primary screenwriter, rewriting the entire script during a nine-week period of principal photography.<ref name=Baer198>{{harvnb|Baer|2008|p=198}}</ref> The script for each scene was typically finished the night before it was shot, after Gottlieb had dinner with Spielberg and members of the cast and crew to decide what would go into the film. Many pieces of dialogue originated from the actors' improvisations during these meals; a few were created on set, the most notable case being Roy Scheider [[ad-lib]]bing the line "You're gonna need a bigger boat".<ref name=Baer>{{harvnb|Baer|2008|pages=201&ndash;202}}</ref> [[John Milius]] contributed dialogue polishes,<ref name=Friedman167/> and ''Sugarland Express'' writers [[Matthew Robbins (screenwriter)|Matthew Robbins]] and [[Hal Barwood]] also made uncredited contributions.<ref name=biskind265>{{harvnb|Biskind|1998|p=265}}</ref> Spielberg has claimed that he prepared his own draft, although it is unclear to what degree the other screenwriters drew on his material.<ref name=Friedman167/> One specific alteration he called for in the story was to change the cause of the shark's death from extensive wounds to a scuba tank explosion, as he felt audiences would respond better to a "big rousing ending".<ref name=jawschap11>{{cite video|first=Laurent|last=Bouzereau|title=A Look Inside Jaws|location=''Jaws'': 30th Anniversary Edition DVD (2005)|year=1995|publisher=Universal Home Video|trans_title="Climax"}}</ref> The director estimated the final script had a total of 27 scenes that were not in the book.<ref name=int11>{{harvnb|Friedman|Notbohm|2000|pages=11&ndash;12}}</ref> 

Benchley had written ''Jaws'' after reading about sport fisherman [[Frank Mundus]]'s capture of an enormous shark in 1964. According to Gottlieb, Quint was loosely based on Mundus, whose book ''Sportfishing for Sharks'' he read for research.<ref name=baer209/> Sackler came up with the backstory of Quint as a survivor of the World War II {{USS|Indianapolis|CA-35|6}} disaster.<ref name=aicn/> The question of who deserves the most credit for writing Quint's celebrated monologue about the ''Indianapolis'' has caused substantial controversy. Spielberg described it as a collaboration between Sackler, Milius, and actor [[Robert Shaw (actor)|Robert Shaw]], who was also a playwright.<ref name="Friedman167">{{harvnb|Friedman|2006|p=167}}</ref> According to the director, Milius turned Sackler's "three-quarters of a page" speech into a monologue, and that was then rewritten by Shaw.<ref name=aicn/> Gottlieb gives primary credit to Shaw, downplaying Milius's contribution.<ref name="Gottlieb208">{{harvnb|Gottlieb|2005|p=208}}</ref>

===Casting===
Despite complying with Zanuck and Brown's request to cast known actors,<ref name=jawschap3/> Spielberg wished to avoid hiring any big stars. He felt that "somewhat anonymous" performers would help the audience "believe this was happening to people like you and me", whereas "stars bring a lot of memories along with them, and those memories can sometimes ... corrupt the story."<ref name=biskind265/> The director added that in his plans "the superstar was gonna be the shark".<ref name=inside_story>{{Cite video | people = Pangolin Pictures| title = Jaws: The Inside Story | medium = Television documentary | publisher = [[The Biography Channel]] | date = 2010-06-16}}</ref> The first actors cast were [[Lorraine Gary]], the wife of then-president of Universal [[Sid Sheinberg]], as Ellen Brody,<ref name=jawschap3>{{cite video|first=Laurent|last=Bouzereau|title=A Look Inside Jaws|location=''Jaws'': 30th Anniversary Edition DVD (2005)|year=1995|publisher=Universal Home Video|trans_title="Casting "}}</ref> and [[Murray Hamilton]] as the mayor of Amity Island.<ref>{{harvnb|Gottlieb|2005|p=56}}</ref> Stuntwoman-turned-actress [[Susan Backlinie]] was cast as Chrissie as she knew how to swim and was willing to perform nude.<ref name=inside_story/> Most minor roles were played by residents of [[Martha's Vineyard]], where the film was shot.

Disappointed in his performance and fearing that no one would want to hire him once ''Kravitz'' was released, he immediately called Spielberg and accepted the role in ''Jaws''. Because the film the director envisioned was so dissimilar to Benchley's novel, Spielberg asked Dreyfuss not to read it.<ref name="Roan30Years">{{cite news|last=Harvey|first=Neil|work=[[The Roanoke Times]]|title=30 years of 'Jaws'|url=http://www.roanoke.com/extra%5C25348.html|date=2005-06-13|accessdate=2010-03-12}}</ref> As a result of the casting, Hooper was rewritten to better suit the actor,<ref name=baer206/> as well as to be more representative of Spielberg, who came to view Dreyfuss as "my alter ego".<ref name="McBride236"/>

Between November 1973 and April 1974, the sharks were fabricated at Rolly Harper's Motion Picture & Equipment Rental in [[Sun Valley, Los Angeles|Sun Valley, California]]. Their construction involved a team of as many as 40 effects technicians, supervised by renowned mechanical effects supervisor Bob Mattey, best known for creating the giant squid in ''[[20,000 Leagues Under the Sea (1954 film)|20,000 Leagues Under the Sea]]''.

The delays proved serendipitous in some regards. The script was refined during production, and the unreliable mechanical sharks forced Spielberg to shoot many scenes so that the shark was only hinted at. For example, for much of the shark hunt, its location is indicated by the floating yellow barrels.<ref name="Sinyard36"/> The opening had the shark devouring Chrissie,<ref name=inside_story/> but it was rewritten so that it would be shot with Backlinie being dragged and yanked by cables to simulate an attack.<ref name=jawschap5>{{cite video|first=Laurent|last=Bouzereau|title=A Look Inside Jaws|location=''Jaws'': 30th Anniversary Edition DVD (2005)|year=1995|publisher=Universal Home Video|trans_title="Production Stories"}}</ref> Spielberg also included multiple shots of just the dorsal fin.

Footage of real sharks was shot by [[Ron & Valerie Taylor|Ron and Valerie Taylor]] in the waters off Australia, with a smaller-framed actor in a miniature shark cage to create the illusion that the sharks were enormous. During the Taylors' shoot, a great white attacked the boat and cage. The footage of the cage attack was so stunning that Spielberg was eager to incorporate it in the film. No one had been in the cage at the time, however, and the script, following the novel, originally had the shark killing Hooper in it. The storyline was consequently altered to have Hooper escape from the cage, which allowed the footage to be used.<ref name=jawschap2>{{cite video|first=Laurent|last=Bouzereau|title=A Look Inside Jaws|location=''Jaws'': 30th Anniversary Edition DVD (2005)|year=1995|publisher=Universal Home Video|trans_title="The Live Shark Footage"}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|McBride|1999|pp=234<U+2013>235}}</ref> As production executive Bill Gilmore put it, "The shark down in Australia rewrote the script and saved Dreyfuss's character."<ref>{{harvnb|McBride|1999|p=235}}</ref>

Fields, who had completed a rough cut of the first two-thirds of the film, up until the shark hunt, finished the editing and reworked some of the material.

There are various interpretations of the meaning and effectiveness of the primary music theme, which is widely acknowledged as one of the most recognizable cinematic themes of all time.<ref name="Reelviews"/> Music scholar Joseph Cancellaro proposes that the two-note expression mimics the shark's heartbeat.<ref>{{harvnb|Cancellaro|2006|p=170}}</ref> According to Alexandre Tylski, like themes [[Bernard Herrmann]] wrote for ''[[Taxi Driver]]'', ''[[North by Northwest]]'', and particularly ''[[Mysterious Island (1961 film)|Mysterious Island]]'', it suggests human respiration. He further argues that the score's strongest motif is actually "the split, the rupture"<U+2014>when it dramatically cuts off, as after Chrissie's death.<ref name=Overture/> The relationship between sound and silence is also taken advantage of in the way the audience is conditioned to associate the shark with its theme,<ref name="Friedman174"/> which is exploited toward the film's climax when the shark suddenly appears with no musical introduction.<ref name="Reelviews"/>

Spielberg later said that without Williams's score the film would have been only half as successful, and according to Williams it jumpstarted his career.<ref name=jawschap14/> He had previously scored Spielberg's debut feature, ''The Sugarland Express'', and went on to collaborate with the director on almost all of his films.<ref name="Friedman174"/> The [[Jaws (soundtrack)|original soundtrack for ''Jaws'']] was released by [[MCA Records]] in 1975, and as a CD in 1992, including roughly a half hour of music that Williams redid for the album.<ref name=empirescore>{{cite web|url=http://www.empireonline.com/reviews/reviewcomplete.asp?SID=6144|title=Empire's Jaws Soundtrack Review|work=[[Empire (magazine)|Empire]]|first=Ian|last=Freer|accessdate=2012-01-05}}</ref><ref name=decca/> In 2000, two versions of the score were released: [[Decca Records|Decca]]/[[Universal Music Group|Universal]] reissued the soundtrack album to coincide with the release of the 25th-anniversary DVD, featuring the entire 51 minutes of the original score,<ref name=empirescore/><ref name=decca>{{cite web|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20031006122029/http://www.deccaclassics.com/music/soundtracks/jaws.html|title=Jaws <U+2013> 25th Anniversary Collector's Edition|publisher=[[Decca Classics]]|url=http://www.deccaclassics.com/music/soundtracks/jaws.html|archivedate=2003-10-06|accessdate=2012-01-02}}</ref> and [[Var<U+00E8>se Sarabande]] put out a rerecording of the score performed by the [[Royal Scottish National Orchestra]], conducted by [[Joel McNeely]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.varesesarabande.com/servlet/the-614/Jaws/Detail|title=Jaws|publisher=[[Var<U+00E8>se Sarabande]]|accessdate=2012-01-01}}</ref>

==Inspirations and themes==
''Jaws'' bears similarities to several literary and artistic works, most notably ''[[Moby-Dick]]'' by [[Herman Melville]]. The character of Quint strongly resembles [[Ahab (Moby-Dick)|Captain Ahab]], the obsessed captain of the ''[[Pequod (Moby-Dick)|Pequod]]'' who devotes his life to hunting a [[sperm whale]]. Quint's monologue reveals a similar obsession with sharks; even his boat, the ''Orca'', is named after the only [[Orca|natural enemy of the white shark]]. In the novel and original screenplay, Quint dies after being dragged under the ocean by a harpoon tied to his leg, similar to Ahab's death in Melville's novel.<ref>{{harvnb|Lemkin|1984|pp=277&ndash;289}}</ref> A direct reference to these similarities may be found in Spielberg's draft of the screenplay, which introduces Quint watching the [[Moby Dick (1956 film)|film version of ''Moby-Dick'']]; his continuous laughter prompts other audience members to get up and leave the theater ([[Wesley Strick]]'s screenplay for the 1991 remake of ''[[Cape Fear (1991 film)|Cape Fear]]'' features a similar scene). However, the scene from ''Moby-Dick'' could not be licensed from the film's star, [[Gregory Peck]], the copyright holder.<ref name=jawschap1/> Screenwriter Carl Gottlieb also drew comparisons to [[Ernest Hemingway]]'s ''[[The Old Man and the Sea]]'': "''Jaws'' is ... a titanic struggle, like Melville or Hemingway."<ref name=baer209>{{harvnb|Baer|2008|page=209}}</ref>

The underwater scenes shot from the shark's point of view have been compared with passages in two 1950s horror films, ''[[The Creature from the Black Lagoon]]'' and ''[[The Monster That Challenged the World]]''.<ref>{{harvnb|Brosnan|1978|p=99}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Brosnan|1978|p=129}}</ref> Gottlieb named two science fiction productions from the same era as influences on how the shark was depicted, or not: ''[[The Thing from Another World]]'', which Gottlieb described as "a great horror film where you only see the monster in the last reel";<ref name=biskind290>{{harvnb|Biskind|1998|p=290}}</ref> and ''[[It Came From Outer Space]]'', where "the suspense was built up because the creature was always off-camera". Those precedents helped Spielberg and Gottlieb to "concentrate on showing the 'effects' of the shark rather than the shark itself".<ref name=Baer/>

Critics such as Neil Sinyard have noticed similarities to [[Henrik Ibsen]]'s play ''[[An Enemy of the People]]''.<ref name="Sinyard32">{{harvnb|Sinyard|1989|p=32}}</ref> Gottlieb himself said he and Spielberg referred to ''Jaws'' as "''Moby-Dick'' meets ''Enemy of the People''."<ref name=Baer208>{{harvnb|Baer|2008|p=208}}</ref>  The Ibsen work features a doctor who discovers that a seaside town's medicinal hot springs, a major tourist attraction and revenue source, are contaminated. When the doctor attempts to convince the townspeople of the danger, he loses his job and is shunned. This plotline is paralleled in ''Jaws'' by Brody's conflict with Mayor Vaughn, who refuses to acknowledge the presence of a shark that may dissuade summer beachgoers from coming to Amity. Brody is vindicated when more shark attacks occur at the crowded beach in broad daylight. Sinyard calls the film a "deft combination of Watergate and Ibsen's play".<ref name="Sinyard32"/>

===Scholarly criticism===
''Jaws'' has received considerable attention from academic critics. Stephen Heath relates the film's ideological meanings to the then-recent [[Watergate scandal]]. He argues that Brody represents the "white male middle class<U+2014>[there is] not a single black and, very quickly, not a single woman in the film", who restores public order "with an ordinary-guy kind of heroism born of fear-and-decency".<ref>{{harvnb|Heath|1976|p=510}}</ref> Yet Heath moves beyond ideological content analysis to examine ''Jaws'' as a signal example of the film as "industrial product" that sells on the basis of "the pleasure of cinema, thus yielding the perpetuation of the industry (which is why part of the meaning of ''Jaws'' is to be the most profitable movie)".<ref>{{harvnb|Heath|1976|p=514}}</ref>

Andrew Britton contrasts the film to the novel's post-Watergate cynicism, suggesting that its narrative alterations from the book (Hooper's survival, the shark's explosive death) help make it "a communal exorcism, a ceremony for the restoration of ideological confidence." He suggests that the experience of the film is "inconceivable" without the mass audience's jubilation when the shark is annihilated, signifying the obliteration of evil itself.<ref>{{harvnb|Britton|1979|p=237}}</ref> In his view, Brody serves to demonstrate that "individual action by the one just man is still a viable source for social change".<ref name=Britton239>{{harvnb|Britton|1979|p=239}}</ref> [[Peter Biskind]] argues that the film does maintain post-Watergate cynicism concerning politics and politicians insofar as the sole villain beside the shark is the town's venal mayor. Yet he observes that, far from the narrative formulas so often employed by [[New Hollywood]] filmmakers of the era<U+2014>involving Us vs. Them, hip [[counterculture]] figures vs. "[[The Man]]"<U+2014>the overarching conflict in ''Jaws'' does not pit the heroes against authority figures, but against a menace that targets everyone regardless of socioeconomic position.<ref>{{harvnb|Biskind|1998|p=279}}</ref>

Whereas Britton states that the film avoids the novel's theme of social class conflicts on Amity Island,<ref name=Britton239/> Biskind detects class divisions in the screen version and argues for their significance. "Authority must be restored," he writes, "but not by Quint". The seaman's "working class toughness and bourgeois independence is alien and frightening ... irrational and out of control". Hooper, meanwhile, is "associated with technology rather than experience, inherited wealth rather than self-made sufficiency"; he is marginalized from the conclusive action, if less terminally than Quint.<ref>{{cite journal |first=Peter |last=Biskind |title=''Jaws'': Between the teeth |journal=[[Jump Cut (journal)|Jump Cut]] |pages=1&ndash;29 |year=1975|url=http://www.ejumpcut.org/archive/onlinessays/JC09folder/Jaws.html |issue=9}}</ref> Britton sees the film more as concerned with the "vulnerability of children and the need to protect and guard them", which in turn helps generate a "pervasive sense of the supreme value of family life: a value clearly related to [ideological] stability and cultural continuity".<ref>{{harvnb|Britton|1979|p=238}}</ref>

[[Fredric Jameson]]'s Marxist analysis highlights the [[polysemy]] of the shark and the multiple ways in which it can be and has been read<U+2014>from representing alien menaces such as communism or the Third World to more intimate dreads concerning the unreality of contemporary American life and the vain efforts to sanitize and suppress the knowledge of death. He asserts that its symbolic function is to be found in this very "polysemousness which is profoundly ideological, insofar as it allows essentially social and historical anxieties to be folded back into apparently 'natural' ones ... to be recontained in what looks like a conflict with other forms of biological existence."<ref>{{harvnb|Jameson|1979|pp=26&ndash;27}}</ref> He views Quint's demise as the symbolic overthrow of an old, populist, [[New Deal]] America and Brody and Hooper's partnership as an "allegory of an alliance between the forces of law-and-order and the new technocracy of the multinational corporations ... in which the viewer rejoices without understanding that he or she is excluded from it."<ref>{{harvnb|Jameson|1979|pp=28&ndash;29}}</ref>

===Promotion===
Universal spent $1.8 million promoting ''Jaws'', including an unprecedented $700,000 on national television spot advertising.<ref name="SharkTale">{{cite news|last=Smith|first=Neil|publisher=[[BBC]] News|title=Shark tale that changed Hollywood|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/4600557.stm|date=2005-06-03|accessdate=2010-03-12}}</ref><ref name=mcbride255>{{harvnb|McBride|1999|pages=255&ndash;256}}</ref> The media blitz saw around twenty-five thirty-second advertisements aired per night on prime-time network TV between June 18, 1975, and the film's opening two days later.<ref name="Kochberg31"/> Beyond that, in the description of film industry scholar Searle Kochberg, Universal "devised and co-ordinated a highly innovative plan" for the picture's marketing.<ref name="Kochberg31"/> As early as October 1974, Zanuck, Brown, and Benchley hit the television and radio talk show circuit to promote the paperback edition of the novel and the forthcoming film.<ref>{{harvnb|Shone|2004|pp=26<U+2013>27}}</ref> The studio and publisher Bantam agreed on a title logo that would appear on both the paperback and in all of the advertising for the movie.<ref name="Kochberg31"/> The centerpieces of the joint promotion strategy were John Williams' theme and the poster image featuring the shark approaching a lone female swimmer.<ref name=colrad>{{harvnb|Collins|Radner|1993|p=18}}</ref> The poster was based on the paperback's cover, and had the same artist, Bantam employee Roger Kastel.<ref>{{harvnb|Petersen|1975|p=70}}</ref> The Seiniger Advertising agency spent six months designing the poster; principal Tony Seiniger explained that "no matter what we did, it didn't look scary enough".

More merchandise was created to take advantage of the film's release. In 1999, Graeme Turner wrote that ''Jaws'' was accompanied by what was still "probably the most elaborate array of tie-ins" of any film to date: "This included a sound-track album, T-shirts, plastic tumblers, a book about the making of the movie, the book the movie was based on, beach towels, blankets, shark costumes, toy sharks, hobby kits, iron-transfers, games, posters, shark's tooth necklaces, sleepwear, water pistols, and more."<ref>{{harvnb|Turner|1999|p=8}}</ref> The [[Ideal Toy Company]], for instance, produced a [[The Game of Jaws|game]] in which the player had to use a hook to fish out items from the shark's mouth before the jaws closed.<ref name="andrews115">{{harvnb|Andrews|1999|p=115}}</ref>

===Theatrical run===
The fervent audience response to a rough cut of the film at two test screenings in Dallas on March 26, 1975, and one in [[Long Beach, California|Long Beach]], on March 28, along with the success of Benchley's novel and the early stages of Universal's marketing campaign, generated great interest among theater owners, facilitating the studio's plan to debut ''Jaws'' at hundreds of cinemas simultaneously.<ref>{{harvnb|Shone|2004|pp=23<U+2013>26}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|McBride|1999|p=253}}</ref> A third and final preview screening, of a cut incorporating changes inspired by the previous presentations, was held in Hollywood on April 24.<ref>{{harvnb|McBride|1999|p=254}}</ref> After Universal chairman [[Lew Wasserman]] attended one of the screenings, he ordered the film's initial release<U+2014>planned for a massive total of as many as 900 theaters<U+2014>to be cut down, declaring, "I want this picture to run all summer long. I don't want people in Palm Springs to see the picture in Palm Springs. I want them to have to get in their cars and drive to see it in Hollywood."<ref>{{harvnb|Shone|2004|p=26}}</ref> Nonetheless, the several hundred theaters that were still booked for the opening represented what was then an unusually [[wide release]]. At the time, wide openings were associated with movies of doubtful quality; not uncommon on the [[Exploitation film|exploitation]] side of the industry, they were customarily employed to diminish the effect of negative reviews and word of mouth. There had been some recent exceptions, precedents that included the rerelease of ''[[Billy Jack]]'' and the original release of its sequel ''[[The Trial of Billy Jack]]'', the ''[[Dirty Harry]]'' sequel ''[[Magnum Force]]'', and the latest installments in the [[James Bond in film|James Bond series]].<ref name=Wyatt111>{{harvnb|Wyatt|1994|p=111}}</ref><ref name=epics>{{harvnb|Hall|Neale|2010|pp=110&ndash;112}}</ref> Still, the typical major studio [[film release]] at the time involved opening at a few big-city theaters, which allowed for a series of premieres. Distributors would then slowly forward prints to additional locales across the country, capitalizing on any positive critical or audience response. The outsized success of the ''[[The Godfather]]'' in 1972 had sparked a trend toward wider releases, but even that film had debuted in just five theaters, before going wide in its second weekend.<ref name=pbs/>

The film was not without its detractors. [[Vincent Canby]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' wrote, "It's a measure of how the film operates that not once do we feel particular sympathy for any of the shark's victims. ... In the best films, characters are revealed in terms of the action. In movies like ''Jaws'', characters are simply functions of the action ... like stage hands who move props around and deliver information when it's necessary". He did, however, describe it as "the sort of nonsense that can be a good deal of fun".<ref>{{cite news| author=Canby, Vincent| work=[[The New York Times]]|title=Entrapped by 'Jaws' of Fear|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1975/06/21/movies/moviesspecial/21JAWS.html| date=1975-06-21| accessdate=2006-08-03}}</ref> ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' critic [[Charles Champlin]] disagreed with the film's PG rating, saying that  "''Jaws'' is too gruesome for children, and likely to turn the stomach of the impressionable at any age. ...

You feel like a rat, being given shock therapy".<ref name="McBride256"/> The most frequently criticized aspect of the film has been the artificiality of its mechanical antagonist: Magill declared that "the programmed shark has one truly phony close-up",<ref name=fir/> and in 2002, online reviewer [[James Berardinelli]] said that if not for Spielberg's deftly suspenseful direction, "we would be doubled over with laughter at the cheesiness of the animatronic creature."<ref name="Reelviews">{{cite news | author=[[James Berardinelli|Berardinelli, James]] | publisher=Reelviews|year=2002|title=Jaws|url=http://reelviews.net/movies/j/jaws.html| accessdate=2006-08-06}}</ref>

''Jaws'' spawned three sequels, none of which approached the success of the original.

Hancock]], was fired a few days into the shoot; ultimately, his obligations to ''[[Close Encounters of the Third Kind]]'', which he was working on with Dreyfuss, made it impossible.<ref>{{harvnb|McBride|1999|pages=257&ndash;258}}</ref> ''[[Jaws 2]]'' (1978) was eventually directed by [[Jeannot Szwarc]]; Scheider, Gary, Hamilton, and [[Jeffrey Kramer]] (who portrayed Deputy Hendricks) reprised their roles. It is generally regarded as the best of the sequels.<ref>
