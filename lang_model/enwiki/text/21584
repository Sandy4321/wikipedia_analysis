The '''Crowned Eagle''', also known as the '''African Crowned Eagle''' or the '''Crowned Hawk-eagle''' (''Stephanoaetus coronatus'') is a very large, powerful, crested [[bird of prey]] found in [[sub-Saharan Africa]]; in [[Southern Africa]] it is restricted to suitable habitat in the [[east]]ern areas.<ref name=subSahara>Sinclair & Ryan (2003). ''Birds of Africa south of the Sahara. ISBN 1-86872-857-9</ref> It is the only [[extant taxon|extant]] member of the [[genus]] ''Stephanoaetus''. A second species, the [[Malagasy Crowned Eagle]] (''Stephanoaetus mahery'') became [[extinct]] after humans settled on [[Madagascar]].<ref name=Goodman>Goodman, Steven M. (1994). Description of a new species of subfossil eagle from Madagascar: Stephanoaetus (Aves: Falconiformes) From The Deposits Of Ampasambazimba. Proceedings of The Biological Society of Washington 107(3): 421<U+2013>428 ISSN 0006-324X [http://biostor.org/reference/81217] [http://extinct-website.com/pdf/81217.pdf]</ref>

It mainly inhabits dense [[forest]]s.<ref name=subSahara/> Its staple diet consists of [[monkey]]s (particularly those of the genus ''[[Chlorocebus]]'') and other medium-sized [[mammal]]s, such as the [[Cape Hyrax]] and small [[antelope]]s.<ref name=HBW>Kemp, A. C. (1994). Crowned Hawk-eagle (Stephanoaetus coronatus). Pp. 205 in: del Hoyo, Elliott & Sargatal. eds. (1994). ''[[Handbook of the Birds of the World]]'', vol. 2. ISBN 84-87334-15-6</ref> To a far lesser extent, [[bird]]s and large [[lizard]]s are also taken.<ref name=HBW/> However, at least 90% of the diet is [[mammal]]ian.<ref name= Mitani>Mitani J.C. , Sanders W.J., Lwanga J.S. & T.L. Windfelder (2001) "Predatory behavior of crowned hawk-eagles (''Stephanoaetus coronatus'') in Kibale National Park, Uganda" ''Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology'' '''49'''(2<U+2013>3): 187<U+2013>195 {{doi|10.1007/s002650000283}}</ref><ref>[http://www.sfzoo.org/crownedeagle African Crowned Eagle].

While on average smaller in all measurements but length than the [[Martial Eagle]], the Crowned Eagle is often considered Africa's most powerful and ferocious [[eagle]] in terms of the weight and nature of prey taken.<ref name=HBW/> It often preys on mammals such as [[duiker]]s, weighing up to {{convert|30|kg|lb|abbr=on}}.<ref name=HBW/><ref name=RaptorsWorld>Ferguson-Lees & Christie (2001). Raptors of the World. ISBN 0-7136-8026-1</ref> Due to their similarities, the Crowned Eagle is often considered Africa's analogue of the [[Harpy Eagle]].

==Description==
[[File:Crownedeagle.jpg|thumb|left|Budongo, W. Uganda]]
The Crowned Eagle has blackish grey upperparts with the belly and breast are marked with blackish bars and blotches, variably marked with cream or rich buff-rufous coloration. The rufous underwing coverts and strongly barred white and black outer wings and tail are all diagnostic in flight.<ref name=subSahara/> The large crest is often raised giving the large head a somewhat triangular appearance. The crest combined with this bird's upright perching posture and large size make the adult nearly unmistakable at suitable range.

The Crowned Eagle is {{convert|80|<U+2013>|99|cm|in|abbr=on}} long with a wingspan of{{convert|1.51|<U+2013>|1.81|m|ft|abbr=on}}. The female, at a weight of {{convert|3.2|-|4.7|kg|lboz|abbr=on}}, is around 10<U+2013>15% larger than the male, at a weight of {{convert|2.55|-|4.12|kg|lboz|abbr=on}}.<ref name=HBW/><ref name=RaptorsWorld/> It, on average, weighs less and has a smaller wing-span than the often sympatric [[Martial Eagle]], its average total length exceeds that of the Martial Eagle thanks to its much longer tail, at {{convert|30|-|41|cm|in|abbr=on}}.<ref name=RaptorsWorld/> This eagle has relatively short, broad and rounded wings, with the [[Wing chord (biology)|wing chord]] measuring {{convert|44.5|-|53.2|cm|in|abbr=on}} for added manoeuvrability in its environment.<ref name=RaptorsWorld/> The [[Tarsus (skeleton)|tarsus]] is of moderate length for a raptor of its size, at {{convert|8.5|-|10.3|cm|in|abbr=on}}, but the [[wikt:talon|talon]]s are heavy, strong and powerful.<ref name=RaptorsWorld/>

The juvenile may be confused with the juvenile Martial Eagle, especially in flight. The juvenile Crowned is all white below and on the head, with darker coloration on the back and wings.<ref name=RaptorsWorld/> It distinguished from the Martial species in having a much longer, more heavily barred tail, much shorter wings and spotted thighs.<ref name=subSahara/>

==Distribution and habitat==
In eastern [[Africa]], the Crowned Eagle's range extends from southern [[Uganda]] and [[Kenya]], forested parts of [[Tanzania]], eastern [[Zambia]], the [[Democratic Republic of Congo]], [[Malawi]], [[Zimbabwe]], [[Mozambique]], [[Swaziland]] and eastern [[South Africa]] about as far south as [[Knysna]].<ref name=subSahara/>

From eastern and southern Africa, its range also extends westward through the [[Congolian forests|Congolian]] and [[Guinean Forests of West Africa|Guinean forests]], but it is now rare in many parts of [[West Africa]].<ref name=HBW/>

The Crowned Eagle inhabits mainly dense [[woodland]]s, including those bordering [[rainforest]], but will sometimes also be found in relict patches, wooded escarpments, [[riparian]] strips of ''[[Acacia]]'', heavily wooded hillsides, and rocky outcrops throughout its range. In southern Africa, it may range secondarily into [[plantation]]s, usually of [[eucalyptus]], and (in [[Zimbabwe]]) can be found in quite open woods with ''[[Adansonia]]'' trees and may occasionally forage in savanna and secondary growth. The Crowned Eagle may be found from an altitude of sea-level to at least {{convert|3000|m|ft|abbr=on}}.<ref name=RaptorsWorld/> Owing to lack of current suitable habitat, the eagle's range is discontinuous.<ref name=RaptorsWorld/>

==Ecology==
{{refimprove section|date=October 2010}}
The Crowned Eagle is non-migratory and is largely sedentary, usually inhabiting a fixed territory for most of its lifespan. There is evidence that the birds migrate moderate distances when circumstances require it, for example when changing mates in isolated breeding areas.<ref>The Hawk Conservancy Trust (2006): [http://www.hawk-conservancy.org/priors/crownedeagle.shtml Crowned Eagle <U+2013> ''Stephanoaetus coronatus'']{{dead link|date=March 2011}}. Retrieved 2006-OCT-7.</ref>{{dead link|date=September 2010}} Such migration is local in scale and is not comparable to the seasonal migrations of some other eagle species (e.g., the [[Steppe Eagle]].)

Whilst essentially an elusive species (owing mostly to its habitat), the Crowned Eagle is highly vocal and has a noisy, undulating display flight. In Equatorial Africa, they often call year-around, while elsewhere they vocalize mainly in the breeding season.<ref name=RaptorsWorld/> The male performs an elaborate rise-and-fall display, engaging in undulating steep dives, stoops and spins over the forest canopy both during the breeding season and outside it as a territorial proposition.<ref name=RaptorsWorld/> During this display, the male is noisy, uttering a shrill ''kewee-kewee-kewee'', and may reach heights exceeding {{convert|900|m|ft}}. The voice is a series of loud whistles that rise and fall in pitch. The female may also perform independent display flights, uttering a lower ''kooee-kooee-kooee'', and pairs are also known to collaborate in spectacular tandems, interlocking talons and falling some distance from the sky.<ref name=RaptorsWorld/> While awaiting food at the nest, both the female and the young call out a penetrating, high ''kwee-kwee-kwee'', that can border on incessant.<ref name=RaptorsWorld/>

===Diet===
The Crowned Eagle's staple diet is mostly mammalian, with [[primate]]s being the most commonly taken prey (82% in one study in [[Uganda]]).<ref name= Mitani/>  In suitable habitat it will also take [[Cape Hyrax|hyraxes]], [[mongoose]], [[galago]]s, [[genet]]s, [[cane rat]]s, [[squirrel]]s, small [[felid]]s and small forest [[antelope]] such as [[duiker]]s.<ref name=RaptorsWorld/> Adult eagles will only resort to hunting large [[bird]]s when mammals scarce, but in southern Africa they are a fairly common component of the diet. Bird prey can include [[guineafowl]], [[francolin]]s, [[pigeon]]s, [[ostrich]] chicks and [[heron]]s and [[stork]]s (mainly fledgings of the latter two groups).<ref name=RaptorsWorld/> In [[Kenya]], at least, [[monitor lizard]]s and [[snake]]s regularly supplement the diet.<ref name=RaptorsWorld/> Domestic animals, including [[chicken]], [[turkey]]s, [[cat]]s, small [[dog]]s, [[lamb]]s, and [[goat]]s, are taken only when wild prey is greatly depleted.<ref name=RaptorsWorld/> Juveniles and subadults, may take non-mammalian prey more frequently than adults. There is a single second-hand report of a [[human]]'s baby skull in a nest, though the only confirmed attacks on humans have been in defense of nests and young, usually with only minor consequences.<ref name=RaptorsWorld/> 

Being a forest-dwelling species, the Crowned Eagle has no need to travel great distances to hunt, nor employ a great deal of active hunting flight (such as soaring seen in [[savannah]]-dwelling species). Rather, it tends to hunt passively. Mostly, they still-hunt, dropping or stooping onto prey from a perch on a branch when its spotted.<ref name=RaptorsWorld/> If hunting in flight, a soaring range of {{convert|4|-|10|mi|km|abbr=on}} is the norm and is only seldom exceeded.{{citation needed|date=October 2010}} After flying above the canopy and locating a suitable hunting spot (sometimes by the call of the noisy [[Vervet Monkey]]), the eagle will wait on a perch, perhaps for a nearby troop of monkeys to be spotted. Following the sighting of suitable prey, the eagle quickly and stealthily manoeuvres itself through the forest towards its prey, a certain element of surprise inherent in its final approach. The sharp, powerful talons may produce sufficient force to kill the prey on impact; if not, death from trauma or [[asphyxiation]] soon follows. More rarely, these eagles will snatch arboreal mammals, such as monkeys, hyraxes and squirrels, out of trees in flight.<ref name=RaptorsWorld/> Typically, the eagle takes prey of a mass, in the range of {{convert|2|-|6|kg|lb|abbr=on}}, roughly equal to its own to its nest and flies with it to a perch. Heavier prey such as duikers, which have been weighed from {{convert|10|-|30|kg|lb|abbr=on}} when killed by a Crowned Eagle, are dismembered and returned to the nest or perch in pieces over the course of several days.<ref name=RaptorsWorld/> Parts of larger prey are often cached for later consumption. Pairs may collaborate in capturing prey, with one bird flushing the prey so the other can ambush it.<ref name=RaptorsWorld/> Due to its preference for relatively dense forest habitats, the Crowned Eagle does not generally compete directly with the Martial Eagle, which shares with the Crowned a broad prey base and an ability to take relatively large prey but generally lives in wooded savanna or semi-open habitats.<ref>[http://www.africanraptors.org/interview-with-alan-kemp-about-the-martial-eagle-in-southern-africa/ Interview with Alan Kemp about the Martial Eagle in Southern Africa]. Africanraptors.org (2011-08-29). Retrieved on 2012-08-22.</ref>

===Breeding===
Crowned Eagle pairs breed once every two years; a single breeding cycle is of approximately 500 days in duration. Breeding can occur almost year-around throughout the range, though usually peaks in the first half of the year.<ref name=RaptorsWorld/>

After engaging in the breeding display described above, the pair collaborate in building a massive nest in a fork of a large forest tree, typically {{convert|12|-|40|m|ft|abbr=on}} above the ground. A nest built from scratch may take several (up to 5) months to construct, however existing nests are often repaired and re-used during successive breeding seasons. The nest is one of the largest built by any eagle. In the first year they build a nest, it may measure {{convert|1.5|m|ft|abbr=on}} across and {{convert|50|cm|in|abbr=on}} deep. However,  larger nest, usually after several years of usage, may measure up to {{convert|2.5|m|ft|abbr=on}} across and up to {{convert|3|m|ft|abbr=on}} deep. The nest may consists of both dead and greener branches and have a light coverage of leaves and animal matter.<ref name=RaptorsWorld/>

The clutch of the Crowned Eagle either contains 1 or 2 eggs. If two eggs are laid, almost invariably the younger one dies by being outcompeted for food by the older one or even directly killed by its older sibling. In cases where the older nestling dies, the younger one may be fed more regularly and survive. Both parents engage in incubation, which lasts for 48 to 51 days. The young fledge at 90 to 115 days, though rarely do so at younger than 110 days. On average, a male chick will first fly around 10 days earlier than a female chick. The young eagle usually remains in the care of its parents for 3 to 9 months after it fledges.<ref name=RaptorsWorld/>

==Conservation status==
The Crowned Eagle is fairly common in suitable habitat, though its numbers show decline in sync with [[deforestation]]. Declines appear to be widespread and may be increasing due to clear-cutting.<ref name=RaptorsWorld/> It is far more common in protected areas and reserves than elsewhere in its range, though is still recorded consistently outside of these areas. In 2012 the species was uplisted to [[Near Threatened]] by [[IUCN]].<ref name=IUCN2012/><ref>{{cite web|title=Recently recategorised species|url=http://www.birdlife.org/action/science/species/global_species_programme/whats_new.html|publisher=Birdlife International (2012)|accessdate=15 June 2012}}</ref>

Like the [[Martial Eagle]], the Crowned has throughout modern history been persecuted by farmers, who hold that the bird is a threat to their livestock.<ref name=RaptorsWorld/><ref>[http://www.sanwild.org/NOTICEBOARD/news2005/CROWNEDEAGLEKILLED.HTML]{{Dead link|date=September 2010}}</ref> In fact, both the Crowned and Martial Eagles only rarely attacks livestock.<ref name=HBW/> On the other hand, some foresters actually encourage protection of populations, due to the controlling effect Crowned Eagles have on populations of potentially harmful mammals.<ref name=RaptorsWorld/>

In April 1996 the world's first captive-born Crowned Eagle hatched at the [[San Diego Zoo]]. Among [[International Species Information System|ISIS]] registered zoos, only San Diego Zoo, [[San Francisco Zoo]], [[Los Angeles Zoo]], [[Fort Worth Zoo]] and [[Lowry Park Zoo]] have this species.<ref>ISIS (2010).
