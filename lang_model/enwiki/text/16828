The '''Bengali Language Movement''', also known as the '''Language Movement''' ({{lang-bn|<U+09AD><U+09BE><U+09B7><U+09BE> <U+0986><U+09A8><U+09CD><U+09A6><U+09CB><U+09B2><U+09A8>}}; ''Bhasha Andolon''), was a political effort in [[Bangladesh]] (then known as [[East Pakistan]]), advocating the recognition of the [[Bengali language]] as an [[official language]] of [[Pakistan]]. Such recognition would allow Bengali to be used in government affairs.

When the state of Pakistan was [[Partition of India|formed]] in 1947, its two regions, East Pakistan (also called [[East Bengal]]) and [[West Pakistan]], were split along cultural, geographical, and linguistic lines. In 1948, the [[Government of Pakistan]] ordained [[Urdu]] as the sole national language, sparking extensive protests among the Bengali-speaking majority of East Pakistan. Facing rising sectarian tensions and mass discontent with the new law, the government outlawed public meetings and rallies. The students of the [[University of Dhaka]] and other political activists defied the law and organised a protest on 21 February 1952. The movement reached its climax when police killed student demonstrators on that day. The deaths provoked widespread civil unrest led by the [[Awami Muslim League]], later renamed the [[Awami League]]. After years of conflict, the central government relented and granted official status to the Bengali language in 1956. In 2000, [[UNESCO]] declared 21 February [[International Mother Language Day]] for the whole world to celebrate,<ref>Glassie, Henry and Mahmud, Feroz.2008.Living Traditions. Cultural Survey of Bangladesh Series-II. Asiatic Society of Bangladesh. Dhaka. p.578</ref> in tribute to the Language Movement and the ethno-linguistic rights of people around the world.
 
The Language Movement catalysed the assertion of Bengali national identity in Pakistan, and became a forerunner to Bengali nationalist movements, including the [[6 Point Movement|6-point movement]] and subsequently the [[Bangladesh Liberation War]] in 1971. In Bangladesh, 21 February is observed as ''[[Language Movement Day]]'', a national holiday. The [[Shaheed Minar]] monument was constructed near Dhaka Medical College in memory of the movement and its victims.

==Background==
The present nations of Pakistan and Bangladesh were part of undivided India during the [[British Raj|British colonial rule]]. From the mid-19th century, the Urdu language had been promoted as the ''[[lingua franca]]'' of [[Islam in India|Indian Muslims]] by political and religious leaders such as [[Khwaja Salimullah|Sir Khwaja Salimullah]], [[Sir Syed Ahmed Khan]], [[Nawab Viqar-ul-Mulk]] and [[Maulvi Abdul Haq]].<ref name=urducontrov>{{cite web

While the use of Urdu grew common with Muslims in northern India, the Muslims of [[Bengal]] (a province in the eastern part of British Indian sub-continent) primarily used the Bengali language.

As early as the late 19th century, social activists such as the [[Islamic feminism|Muslim feminist]] [[Roquia Sakhawat Hussain]] were choosing to write in Bengali to reach out to the people and develop it as a modern literary language.  Supporters of Bengali opposed Urdu even before the [[partition of India]], when delegates from Bengal rejected the idea of making Urdu the lingua franca of Muslim India in the 1937 [[Lucknow]] session of the [[All-India Muslim League|Muslim League]]. The Muslim League was a [[British India]]n political party that became the driving force behind the creation of Pakistan as a [[Islam|Muslim]] state separate from British India.<ref name=tariqcontrov>{{cite journal

==Early stages of the movement==
[[Image:Partition of India.PNG|thumb|Britain's holdings on the [[Indian subcontinent]] were granted independence in 1947 and 1948, becoming four new independent states: [[India]], [[Burma]] (now Myanmar), Ceylon (now [[Sri Lanka]]), and Pakistan (including East Pakistan, modern-day Bangladesh).]]
After the partition of India in 1947, Bengali-speaking people in East Pakistan (also known as East Bengal) made up 44 million of the newly formed Pakistan's 69 million people.<ref name="Banglapedia">{{cite web

===Agitations of 1948===
[[Image:LMimage.jpg|thumb|Rallies at the University of Dhaka area.]]
Students of the [[University of Dhaka]] and other colleges of the city organized a general strike in 11 March 1948 to protest the omission of Bengali language from official use, including coins, stamps and recruitment tests for the navy. The movement restated the demand that Bengali be declared an official language of Pakistan. Political leaders such as Shamsul Huq, [[Shawkat Ali]], [[Kazi Golam Mahboob]], [[Oli Ahad]], [[Abdul Wahed (Bangladesh politician)|Abdul Wahed]] and others were arrested during the rallies. Rally leader [[Mohammad Toaha]] was hospitalised after attempting to snatch a rifle from a police officer. Student leaders, including [[Abdul Matin (language activist)|Abdul Matin]] and [[Abdul Malek Ukil]] took part in the procession.<ref name="Banglapedia"/>

In the afternoon of 11 March, a meeting was held to protest police brutality and arrests. A group of students marching towards the chief minister [[Khawaja Nazimuddin]]'s house was stopped in front of the [[Dhaka High Court]]. The rally changed its direction and moved in the direction of the Secretariat building. Police attacked the procession injuring several students and leaders including [[A. K. Fazlul Huq]].<ref name=helal263>{{Harv|Al Helal|2003|pp=263<U+2013>265}}</ref> Continuing strikes were observed from 12 March to 15 March. Under such circumstances, the chief minister Nazimuddin signed an accord with the student leaders agreeing to some of the terms and conditions, without complying to the demand that Bengali be made a state language.<ref name="Banglapedia"/>

In the height of civic unrest, [[Governor-General of Pakistan]] [[Muhammad Ali Jinnah]] arrived in Dhaka on 19 March 1948. On 21 March, at a civic reception at [[Suhrawardy Udyan|Racecourse Ground]], he claimed that the language issue was designed by a "[[fifth column]]" to divide Pakistani Muslims.<ref name="choudhury">{{cite journal

==Events of 1952==
[[Image:4th Feb 1952 NobabPureRoad.jpg|thumb|Procession march held on 4 February 1952 at Nawabpur Road, Dhaka.]]
The Urdu-Bengali controversy was reignited when Jinnah's successor, governor-general Khawaja Nazimuddin, staunchly defended the "Urdu-only" policy in a speech on 27 January 1952.<ref name=helal263/> On 31 January, the ''[[Shorbodolio Kendrio Rashtrobhasha Kormi Porishod]]'' (All-Party Central Language Action Committee) was formed in a meeting at the Bar Library Hall of the University of Dhaka, chaired by [[Maulana Bhashani]].<ref name="Banglapedia"/><ref>{{Cite news

The action committee called for an all out protest on 21 February, including strikes and rallies.<ref name=helal263/> Students of the University of Dhaka and other institutions gathered on the university premises on 4 February and warned the government to withdraw its proposal to write Bengali in Arabic script, and insisted on the recognition of Bengali. As the preparation for demonstrations was going on, the government imposed [[Section 144]] in the city of Dhaka, thereby banning any gatherings of more than four people.

===21 February===
[[Image:Meeting at Amtala on Ekushey February.JPG|thumb|Meeting on the University of Dhaka premises on 21 February 1952]]
At nine o'clock in the morning, students began gathering on the University of Dhaka premises in defiance of Section 144. The university vice-chancellor and other officials were present as armed police surrounded the campus. By a quarter past eleven, students gathered at the university gate and attempted to break the police line. Police fired [[tear gas]] shells towards the gate to warn the students.<ref name="Banglapedia"/> A section of students ran into the Dhaka Medical College while others rallied towards the university premises cordoned by the police. The vice-chancellor asked police to stop firing and ordered the students to leave the area. However, the police arrested several students for violating section 144 as they attempted to leave. Enraged by the arrests, the students met around the [[East Bengal Legislative Assembly]] and blocked the legislators' way, asking them to present their insistence at the assembly. When a group of students sought to storm into the building, police opened fire and killed a number of students, including [[Abdus Salam (language martyr)|Abdus Salam]], [[Rafiq Uddin Ahmed]], [[Abul Barkat]] and [[Abdul Jabbar (activist)|Abdul Jabbar]].<ref name="Banglapedia"/><ref>{{cite news

[[Image:21feb1956 Shaheed Minar Dhaka.jpg|right|thumb|Foundation of the Shaheed Minar laid down in Dhaka by Abul Barkat's family members.]]
The ''Shorbodolio Kendrio Rashtrobhasha Kormi Porishod'', with support from the [[Awami League]], decided to commemorate 21 February as ''Shohid Dibosh'' (Martyrs' Day). On the first anniversary of the protests, people across East Pakistan wore black badges in solidarity with the victims. Most offices, banks and educational institutions were closed to observe the occasion. Student groups made agreements with college and police officials to preserve law and order. More than 100,000 people assembled at a public meeting held in [[Armanitola]] in Dhaka, where community leaders called for the immediate release of Maulana Bhashani and other political prisoners.<ref name="Banglapedia"/> However, West Pakistani politicians such as Fazlur Rahman aggravated sectional tensions by declaring that anyone who wanted Bengali to become an official language would be considered an "enemy of the state." Bengali students and civilians disobeyed the restrictions to celebrate the anniversary of the protests. Demonstrations broke out on the night of 21 February 1954 with various halls of the University of Dhaka raising black flags in mourning.<ref>{{Harv|Al Helal|2003|pp=604<U+2013>609}}</ref> Police arrested students and other protesters, who were released later despite refusing to post bail.

===United Front in 1954===
Political tensions came to a head as elections to the provincial assembly of East Bengal were held in 1954. The ruling Muslim League denounced the opposition [[United Front (East Pakistan)|United Front]] coalition, which<U+2014>led by [[A. K. Fazlul Huq]] and the Awami League<U+2014>wanted greater provincial autonomy. Several United Front leaders and activists were arrested.<ref name=Helal601603>{{Harv|Al Helal|2003|pp=600<U+2013>603}}</ref> A meeting of parliament's Muslim League members, chaired by prime minister [[Muhammad Ali Bogra]], resolved to give official recognition to Bengali. This decision was followed by a major wave of unrest as other ethnic groups sought recognition of other regional languages. Proponents of Urdu such as Maulvi Abdul Haq condemned any proposal to grant official status to Bengali. He led a rally of 100,000 people to protest against the Muslim League's decision.<ref>{{Cite news

The Government supported a major project to construct a new Shaheed Minar.

===Constitution reform===
On 7 May 1954, the constituent assembly resolved, with the Muslim League's support, to grant official status to Bengali.<ref name="Pakspace"/> Bengali was recognised as the second official language of Pakistan on 29 February 1956, and article 214(1) of the constitution of Pakistan was reworded to "The state language of Pakistan shall be Urdu and Bengali."

However, the military government formed by [[Ayub Khan (Field Marshal)|Ayub Khan]] made attempts to re-establish Urdu as the sole national language. On 6 January 1959, the military regime issued an official statement and reinstated the official stance of supporting the 1956 constitution's policy of two state languages.<ref name="lambert">{{cite journal

===Liberation of Bangladesh===
{{Main|Bangladesh Liberation War}}
Although the question of official languages was settled by 1956, the military regime of Ayub Khan promoted the interests of West Pakistan at the expense of East Pakistan. Despite forming the majority of the national population, the East Pakistani community continued to be under-represented in the civil and military services, and received a minority of state funding and other government help. This was mainly due to lack of [[democracy|representative government]] in the fledgling state. Mainly due to regional economic imbalances sectional divisions grew, and support for the Bengali ethnic nationalist Awami League,<ref name=uddin/> which invoked the [[Six point movement|6-point movement]] for greater provincial autonomy. One demand was that East Pakistan be called ''Bangladesh'' (Land of Bengalis), which subsequently led to the [[Bangladesh Liberation War]].<ref name="B2g"/><ref name=JSToldenburg/>

The Language Movement had a major cultural impact on Bengali society. It has inspired the development and celebration of the Bengali language, literature and culture. 21 February, celebrated as Language Movement Day or ''Shohid Dibosh'' (Martyrs' Day), is a major national holiday in Bangladesh. A month-long event called the [[Ekushey Book Fair]] is held every year to commemorate the movement. ''[[Ekushey Padak]]'', one of the highest civilian awards in Bangladesh, is awarded annually in memory of the sacrifices of the movement.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://banglapedia.search.com.bd/HT/N_0081.htm |title=National Awards |accessdate=2007-06-23 |last=Khan |first=Sanjida |work= Banglapedia|publisher=Asiatic Society of Bangladesh }}</ref> Songs such as [[Abdul Gaffar Choudhury]]'s ''[[Amar Bhaier Rokte Rangano]]'', set to music by Shaheed Altaf Mahmud, as well as plays, works of art and poetry played a considerable role in rousing the people's emotions during the movement.<ref name=cultureimp>{{cite book |last=Aminzade |first=Ronald |authorlink= |coauthors=Douglas McAdam, Charles Tilly  |title=Silence and Voice in the Study of Contentious Politics |url=http://books.google.com/?id=h8PNEOZRRt8C&printsec=frontcover&dq=bangladesh+language+movement  |accessdate=2007-06-24  |date=17 September 2001 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge |isbn=0-521-00155-2 |chapter=Emotions and Contentious Politics |page=42 }}</ref> Since the events of February 1952, poems, songs, novels, plays, films, cartoons and paintings were created to capture the movement from varied point of views.

Two years after the first monument was destroyed by the police, a new ''[[Shaheed Minar]]'' (Monument of Martyrs) was constructed in 1954 to commemorate the protesters who lost their lives. Work on a larger monument designed by the architect [[Hamidur Rahman (artist)|Hamidur Rahman]] began in 1957 with the support of the United Front ministry. Hamidur Rahman<U+2019>s model consisted of a large complex in the yard of the Dhaka Medical College Hostel. The design included a half-circular column  symbolizing a mother with her martyred sons standing at the dais in the center of the monument. Although the imposition of martial law in 1958 interrupted the work, the monument was completed and inaugurated on 21 February 1963 by [[Abul Barkat]]'s mother, Hasina Begum. Pakistani forces demolished the monument during the Bangladesh Liberation War of 1971, but the Bangladeshi government reconstructed it in 1973.<ref>{{cite book |last=Imam |first=Jahanara |authorlink=Jahanara Imam |title=Ekattorer Dingulee|year=1986 |publisher=Shondhani Prokashani |location=Dhaka |language=Bengali |isbn=984-480-000-5 |page=44  }}</ref>

Outside East Pakistan, movement for equal status of Bengali also took place in the [[India]]n state of [[Assam]]. On May 19, 1961, 11 Bengalis were killed in Police firing in [[Silchar]] Railway Station, Assam, while demanding state recognition of Bengali language. Subsequently, Bengali was given semi-official status in the three Bengali-majority districts of Assam.<ref name="telegraph">[http://www.telegraphindia.com/1080520/jsp/jharkhand/story_9294570.jsp Court route for language status ], The Telegraph, May 20, 2008.</ref>

==Criticism==
Although the Language Movement is considered to have laid the foundations for [[ethnic nationalism]] in many of the Bengalis of East Pakistan, it also heightened the cultural animosity between the authorities of the two wings of Pakistan.<ref name="B2g"/><ref name=uddin/><ref name="BH">{{cite web

This kind of thinking also provoked considerable opposition in West Pakistan, wherein there existed several linguistic groups.<ref name=JSToldenburg/> As late as in 1967, military dictator Ayub Khan said, "East Bengal is ... still under considerable Hindu culture and influence."<ref name=JSToldenburg/> 

The Awami Muslim League turned over to [[Bengali nationalism]] after the Movement, and shed the word "Muslim" from its name.<ref name=apcss>{{cite book |last= Lintner|first= Bertil |editor= eds Satu Limaye, Robert Wirsing, Mohan Malik|others= |title=Religious Radicalism and Security in South Asia |url=http://www.apcss.org/Publications/Edited%20Volumes/ReligiousRadicalism/ReligiousRadicalism.htm  |accessdate=2007-06-28 |year=2004|month=January |publisher=Asia-Pacific Center for Security Studies |location=Honolulu, Hawaii  |isbn=0-9719416-6-1|chapter=Chapter 17: Religious Extremism and Nationalism in Bangladesh |chapterurl=http://www.apcss.org/Publications/Edited%20Volumes/ReligiousRadicalism/PagesfromReligiousRadicalismandSecurityinSouthAsiach17.pdf |format=PDF |page= 413 }}</ref> This ethnic nationalist approach of the party led to alienation of leaders such as [[Golam Azam]] who were supportive of the Muslim activism rather than the ethnic nationalist approach. The Language Movement inspired similar discontent in West Pakistan and provided momentum to ethnic nationalist parties.<ref name="B2g"/> The political unrest in East Pakistan and rivalry between the central government and the United Front-led provincial government was one of the main factors culminating in the 1958 military coup by Ayub Khan.<ref name=UStudies/>
