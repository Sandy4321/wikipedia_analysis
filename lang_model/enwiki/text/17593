'''''Of Human Feelings''''' is a [[studio album]] by American [[jazz]] saxophonist and composer [[Ornette Coleman]]. It was recorded on April 25, 1979, at [[CBS Studio Building|CBS Studios]] in New York City with his band Prime Time, which featured guitarists Charlie Ellerbee and [[Bern Nix]], bassist [[Jamaaladeen Tacuma]], and drummers Calvin Weston and Coleman's son [[Denardo Coleman|Denardo]]. It followed Coleman's failed attempt to record a [[direct to disc recording|direct-to-disc]] session earlier in March 1979.

''Of Human Feelings'' explores [[jazz-funk]] music and continues Coleman's [[harmolodic]] approach to improvisation with Prime Time, whom he introduced on his 1975 album ''[[Dancing in Your Head]]''. He drew on [[rhythm and blues]] influences from early in his career for ''Of Human Feelings'', which had shorter and more distinct compositions than ''Dancing in Your Head''. Coleman also applied [[free jazz]] principles from his music during the 1960s to elements of [[funk]].

Following a change in management, Coleman signed with [[Island Records]], and ''Of Human Feelings'' was released in 1982 by its subsidiary label [[Antilles Records]]. Critics praised Coleman's expressive music and harmolodic approach, but the album made little commercial impact and went [[out of print]]. Coleman enlisted his son Denardo as manager after a dispute with his former managers over the album's [[royalties]], a change that inspired him to perform publicly again during the 1980s.

== Background ==
[[File:Jamaaladeen Tacuma.jpg|right|thumb|[[Jamaaladeen Tacuma]] (pictured in 2007) was both challenged and enthused by [[Ornette Coleman]]'s theory of [[harmolodics]].]]
By the end of the 1960s, Ornette Coleman had become one of the most influential musicians in [[jazz]] after pioneering its most controversial subgenre, [[free jazz]], which jazz critics and musicians initially derided for its deviation from conventional structures of [[harmony]] and [[tonality]].<ref>{{harvnb|Palmer|1982}}; {{harvnb|Rinzler|2008|pp=62<U+2013>63}}</ref> In the mid-1970s, he stopped recording free jazz, recruited electric instrumentalists, and pursued a new creative theory he called [[harmolodics]].{{sfn|Cohen|2012|p=97}} According to Coleman's theory, all the musicians are able to play individual melodies in any [[key (music)|key]], and still sound coherent as a group. He taught his young sidemen this new improvisational and ensemble approach, based on their individual tendencies, and prevented them from being influenced by conventional styles.{{sfn|Palmer|1986}} Coleman likened this group ethic to a spirit of "[[collective consciousness]]" that stresses "human feelings" and "biological rhythms", and said that he wanted the music, rather than himself, to be successful.{{sfn|Nelson|Bittan|Takiff|Carrier|1982|p=52}} He also started to incorporate elements from other styles into his music, including [[rock music|rock]] influences such as electric guitar and non-Western rhythms played by Moroccan and Nigerian musicians.{{sfn|Palmer|1982}} 

''Of Human Feelings'' was a continuation of the harmolodics approach Coleman had applied with Prime Time, an electric quartet introduced on his 1975 album ''[[Dancing in Your Head]]''. The group comprised guitarists Charlie Ellerbee and [[Bern Nix]], bassist [[Jamaaladeen Tacuma]], and drummers [[Ronald Shannon Jackson]] and [[Denardo Coleman]], Ornette Coleman's son.<ref>{{harvnb|Palmer|1986}}; {{harvnb|Litweiler|1992|p=170}}</ref> Tacuma was still in high school when Coleman enlisted him, and first recorded with Prime Time in 1975 for the album ''[[Body Meta]]'', which was released in 1978.<ref>{{harvnb|Nicholson|1998|p=313}}; {{harvnb|Larkin|1998|p=5280}}</ref> Tacuma had played in an ensemble for jazz organist [[Charles Earland]], but Earland dismissed him as he felt audiences gave excessive attention to his playing. Coleman found Tacuma's playing ideal for harmolodics and encouraged him not to change.{{sfn|Mandel|2007|p=161}} Although Coleman's theory initially challenged his knowledge and perception of music, Tacuma came to like the unconventional role each band member was given as a soloist and melodist: "When we read Ornette's music we have his [[note (music)|notes]], but we listen for his [[phrase (music)|phrases]] and phrase the way he wants to. I can take the same melody, then, and phrase it like I want to, and those notes will determine the phrasing, the rhythm, the harmony&nbsp;<U+2013> all of that."{{sfn|Mandel|2007|p=162}}

== Recording ==
In March 1979, Coleman went to [[RCA Records]]' New York studio to produce an album with Prime Time by [[Direct to disc recording|direct-to-disc recording]]. They had mechanical problems with the studio equipment and the recording was rejected. The failed session was a project under Phrase Text, Coleman's [[Music publisher (popular music)|music publishing company]]. He wanted to set up his own record company with the same name, and chose his old friend Kunle Mwanga as his manager. In April, Mwanga arranged another session at [[CBS Studio Building|CBS Studios]] in New York City.{{sfn|Litweiler|1992|p=170}} Coleman and Prime Time recorded ''Of Human Feelings'' there on April 25.{{sfn|Anon.|1982a}} The session was originally titled ''Fashion Faces''. Jackson, Prime Time's original drummer, did not record with the band. Calvin Weston was hired in his place to play simultaneously with Denardo Coleman on drums.{{sfn|Litweiler|1992|p=170}}

Coleman recorded ''Of Human Feelings'' without any equipment problems and found the production process very simple: "We recorded all the pieces only once, so all the numbers were first takes. And there was no mixing. It is almost exactly as we played it."<ref>{{harvnb|Litweiler|1992|p=170}}; {{harvnb|Wilson|1999|p=207}}.</ref> The album was recorded with a Sony [[PCM adaptor|PCM-1600]] two-track [[digital recording|digital recorder]], a rare item at the time.{{sfn|Butterworth|2013}} According to journalist Howard Mandel, the [[passage (music)|passages]] played by the band sounded neither very soft or loud on the album, because it had been [[audio mixing (recorded music)|mixed]] with a middle-[[frequency]] range and [[dynamic range compression|compressed dynamics]].{{sfn|Mandel|2007|p=162}} Because of the equipment used, Coleman did not embellish the album with added effects and avoided [[overdubbing]], [[Multitrack recording|multi-tracking]], and [[remix]]ing.{{sfn|Butterworth|2013}} According to him, ''Of Human Feelings'' was the first jazz album to be digitally recorded in the United States.{{sfn|Wilson|1999|p=207}}

According to ''[[The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians|The Concise Oxford Dictionary of Music]]'' (2004), ''Of Human Feelings'' features [[jazz-funk]], a type of music that originated around 1970 and was characterized by intricate rhythmic patterns, a recurrent bass line, and [[Latin American music|Latin rhythmic]] elements.{{sfn|Kennedy|Bourne|2004|p=152}} Lloyd Sachs of the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' wrote that, although Coleman was not viewed as a [[jazz fusion]] artist, the album can be described as such because of its combination of free jazz and [[funk]].{{sfn|Sachs|1997|p=10}} Jazz writer Stuart Nicholson viewed it as the culmination of Coleman's musical principles that dated back to his free jazz music in 1960, but reappropriated with a funk-oriented [[backbeat]].{{sfn|Harrison|Fox|Thacker|Nicholson|2000|p=574}} According to [[music journalism|jazz critic]] Barry McRae, "it was as if Coleman was translating the concept of the famous double quartet" from his 1961 album ''[[Free Jazz (album)|Free Jazz]]'' to what was required to perform jazz-funk.{{sfn|McRae|Middleton|1988|p=67}}

Coleman incorporated traditional [[Musical form|structures]] and rhythms, and other elements from the [[rhythm and blues]] music he had played early his career.{{sfn|Giddins|1985|p=241}} According to Mandel, the album's simple, brisk music was more comparable to a coherent R&B band than jazz fusion.{{sfn|Mandel|2007|pp=162<U+2013>163}} Although Coleman still performed the melodies on a song, he employed two guitarists for [[contrast (music)|contrast]] to make each pair of guitarist and drummer responsible for either the rhythm or melody.{{sfn|McRae|Middleton|1988|p=67}} Ellerbee provided [[accent (music)|accented]] [[linear counterpoint]] and Nix played variations of the song's melody, while Denardo Coleman and Weston played both [[polyrhythm]]s and backbeats.<ref>{{harvnb|Giddins|1982|p=4}}; {{harvnb|Palmer|1982}}</ref> Tacuma and Ornette Coleman's instrumental [[call and response (music)|responses]] were played as the foreground to the less prominent guitars.{{sfn|Litweiler|1992|p=170}} McRae remarked that Coleman and Prime Time exchanged "directional hints" throughout the songs, as one player changed key and the others [[Modulation (music)|modulated]] accordingly.{{sfn|McRae|Middleton|1988|p=67}} The band made no attempt to harmonize their radically different parts.{{sfn|Mandel|2007|p=162}}

}}
''Of Human Feelings'' features shorter and more distinct compositions than ''Dancing in Your Head''.{{sfn|Palmer|1986}} "Sleep Talk", "Air Ship", and "Times Square" were originally performed by Coleman during his concerts in 1978 under the names "Dream Talking", "Meta", and "Writing in the Streets", respectively. "What Is the Name of That Song?" was titled as a sly reference to two of his older compositions, "Love Eyes" and "Forgotten Songs" (also known as "Holiday for Heroes"), whose [[theme (music)|themes]] were played concurrently and transfigured by Prime Time.{{sfn|Wilson|1999|p=207}} The theme from "Forgotten Songs", originally from Coleman's 1972 album ''[[Skies of America]]'', was used as a [[refrain]].{{sfn|Giddins|1982|p=4}} 

On songs such as "Jump Street" and "Love Words", Ellerbee incorporated [[distortion (music)|distortion]] into his guitar playing, which gave the songs a thicker [[Texture (music)|texture]].{{sfn|Palmer|1982}} "Jump Street" is a [[blues]] piece, "Air Ship" comprises a six-[[bar (music)|bar]] riff, and the [[atonality|atonal]] "Times Square" has futuristic dance themes.<ref>{{harvnb|Giddins|1982|p=4}}; {{harvnb|Harrison|Fox|Thacker|Nicholson|2000|p=574}}</ref> "Love Words" heavily uses [[Polymodal chromaticism|polymodality]], a central feature of harmolodics, and juxtaposes Coleman's extended solo against a dense, rhythmically complex backdrop. Nicholson observed [[Music of West Africa|West African]] rhythms and collective improvisation rooted in [[Dixieland|New Orleans jazz]] on "Love Words", and suggested that "Sleep Talk" was derived from the opening [[bassoon]] solo in [[Igor Stravinsky]]'s ''[[The Rite of Spring]]''.{{sfn|Harrison|Fox|Thacker|Nicholson|2000|p=574}}

== Release and promotion ==
A few weeks after ''Of Human Feelings'' was recorded, Mwanga went to Japan to negotiate a deal with [[Kenwood Corporation|Trio Records]] to have the album released on Phrase Text. Trio, who had previously released a compilation of Coleman's 1966 to 1971 live performances in Paris, prepared to [[record press|press]] the album once Mwanga provided the label with the [[matrix numbers|record stamper]]. Coleman was also set to perform his song "Skies of America" with the [[NHK Symphony Orchestra]], but cancelled both deals upon Mwanga's return from Japan. Mwanga immediately quit after less than four months as Coleman's manager.{{sfn|Litweiler|1992|p=170}} In 1981, Coleman hired Stan and [[Sid Bernstein]] as his managers, who sold the album's recording tapes to [[Island Records]].<ref>{{harvnb|Davis|1986|p=143}}; {{harvnb|Nicholson|1990|p=109}}</ref> He signed with the record label that year, and ''Of Human Feelings'' was released in 1982 on Island's subsidiary jazz label [[Antilles Records]].<ref>{{harvnb|Davis|1986|p=143}}; {{harvnb|Davis|1986|p=143}}</ref>

According to jazz writer [[Francis Davis]], "a modest commercial breakthrough seemed imminent" for Coleman, who appeared to be regaining his celebrity.{{sfn|Davis|1986|pp=142<U+2013>3}} German musicologist [[:de:Peter Niklas Wilson|Peter Niklas Wilson]] said that the album may have been the most tuneful and commercial-sounding of his career at that point.{{sfn|Wilson|1999|p=206}} The album's clean mix and relatively short tracks were interpreted as an attempt for [[airplay|radio airplay]] by Mandel, who described its production as "the surface consistency that would put it in the pop sphere".{{sfn|Mandel|2007|p=162}} ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' magazine published a front-page story at the time about its distinction as both the first digital album recorded in New York City and the first digital jazz album recorded by an American label.{{sfn|Litweiler|1992|pp=152, 170}}

Despite its commercial potential, ''Of Human Feelings'' had no success on the American [[hit parade|pop charts]].{{sfn|McRae|Middleton|1988|p=68}} It [[record chart|charted]] at number 15 on the [[Top Jazz Albums]], where it spent 26 weeks.<ref>{{harvnb|Anon.|n.d.}}; {{harvnb|Anon.|1982b|p=33}}</ref> According to McRae, the album offered a middle ground between funk and jazz to consumers and consequently appealed to neither demographic of listeners.{{sfn|McRae|Middleton|1988|p=68}} ''[[Sound & Vision (magazine)|Sound & Vision]]'' magazine's Brent Butterworth speculated that it was overlooked because it had electric instruments, rock and funk drumming, and did not conform to what he felt was the hokey image of jazz that many of the genre's fans preferred.{{sfn|Butterworth|2013}}

== Critical reception ==
''Of Human Feelings'' received considerable acclaim from contemporary critics.{{sfn|Tinder|1982|p=19}} In a review for ''[[Esquire (magazine)|Esquire]]'', jazz journalist [[Gary Giddins]] hailed it as another landmark album from Coleman and his most accomplished work of harmolodics, partly because of compositions which he said are clearly expressed and occasionally timeless. Giddins believed its discordant keys radically transmute conventional [[polyphony]] and may be the most challenging part for listeners, whom he said should concentrate on Coleman's playing and "let the maelstrom resolve itself around his center".{{sfn|Giddins|1982|p=4}} ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine's Buzz Morrison wrote in his four-star review that the album will challenge but ultimately appeal to listeners.{{sfn|Morrison|1982|p=43}} Kofi Natambu of the ''[[Metro Times|Detroit Metro Times]]'' said Coleman's synergetic approach displayed expressive immediacy rather than superficial technical flair and called the album "a multi-tonal mosaic of great power, humor, color, wit, sensuality, compassion and tenderness". He found its songs inspirational, danceable, and encompassing developments in [[African-American music]] over the previous century.{{sfn|Natambu|1982|p=39}} [[Robert Christgau]], writing in ''[[The Village Voice]]'', was impressed by how the music relieves listeners of [[tension (music)|tension]] with its sophisticated exchange of rhythms and simple pieces of melody: "The way the players break into ripples of song only to ebb back into the tideway is participatory democracy at its most practical and utopian."{{sfn|Christgau|1982}}

[[Purist]] critics in jazz complained about the music's incorporation of dance beats and electric guitar.{{sfn|Palmer|1982}} In a review for ''[[Stereo Review]]'' magazine, [[Chris Albertson]] criticized Coleman's production and remarked that the combination of saxophone and bizarre funk can be captivating, but ultimately loses clarity.{{sfn|Albertson|1982|p=83}} [[Leonard Feather]], writing in the ''[[The Blade (newspaper)|Toledo Blade]]'', felt the saxophone and guitar passages sound inconsistent when played in unison and that the stylistically ambiguous music is potentially controversial and difficult to assess but interesting enough to warrant a listen.{{sfn|Feather|1982|p=3}} Dan Sullivan of the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' remarked that the album's supporters in "hip rock circles" have overlooked flaws, which he thought were a dilutive digital production and occasionally disjointed, one-dimensional playing. He praised Tacuma's playing and Coleman's phrasing as a unique "beacon of clarity" amid an incessant background.{{sfn|Sullivan|1982|p=K80}} ''[[Musician (magazine)|Musician]]'' magazine's [[J.&nbsp;D. Considine]] said he would rate the album higher than its predecessor ''Body Meta'' but below the more essential ''Dancing in Your Head'', although he admitted his more knowledgeable friends consider ''Of Human Feelings'' to be the best of the three albums because of its compositions and the players' execution.{{sfn|Considine|1982|p=73}}

In a year-end list for ''Billboard'', editor Peter Keepnews named ''Of Human Feelings'' the best album of 1982 and wrote that it is the prime example so far of fusing free jazz with modern funk.{{sfn|Keepnews|1983|p=68}} In their year-end lists for ''[[The Phoenix (newspaper)|The Boston Phoenix]]'', critics James Hunter and Howard Hampton ranked it number one and number four, respectively.{{sfn|Anon.|1983a|p=12}} ''Of Human Feelings'' was voted as the thirteenth-best album of 1982 in the [[Pazz&nbsp;& Jop]], an annual critics poll run by ''The Village Voice''.{{sfn|Anon.|1983b}} Christgau, the poll's creator and supervisor, ranked it number one in an accompanying list, and in 1990 he named it the second-best album of the 1980s.<ref>{{harvnb|Christgau|1983}}; {{harvnb|Christgau|1990}}</ref> At that point, ''Of Human Feelings'' was one of only 18 albums to have received his "A+" grade, which the ''[[Press-Telegram]]'' called his highest honor.{{sfn|Anon.|1990}}

== Aftermath ==
[[File:Ornette at The Forum 1982.jpg|left|thumb|upright|Coleman performing in 1982]]

Coleman, who received $25,000 for the album's [[publishing rights]], said his managers sold ''Of Human Feelings'' for less than the recording costs, and that he did not receive any of its [[royalties]]. Stan Bernstein stated that Coleman had financial expectations that were "unrealistic in this business unless you're Michael Jackson". Antilles label executive Ron Goldstein felt that the $25,000 Coleman received was neither a great nor a fair amount for someone in jazz.{{sfn|Davis|1986|pp=143<U+2013>4}}

After Coleman had gone over budget to record a follow-up album, Island did not release it nor pick up their [[option (finance)|option]] on him, and in 1983, he left the Bernstein Agency.{{sfn|Davis|1986|p=144}} He chose Denardo Coleman to manage his career and consequently overcame his reticence of public performance, which had been rooted in his distrust of doing business with a predominantly White music industry.{{sfn|Nicholson|1990|p=109}} According to Nicholson, "the man once accused of standing on the throat of jazz was welcomed back to the touring circuits with both curiosity and affection" during the 1980s.{{sfn|Nicholson|1990|p=109}} Coleman did not record another album for six years and instead performed internationally with Prime Time.{{sfn|McRae|Middleton|1988|p=68}} ''Of Human Feelings'' went [[out of print]].{{sfn|Cooper|Smay|2004|p=238}}

Having showcased his style of avant-garde jazz on the album, Tacuma became widely viewed as one of the most distinctive bassists since [[Jaco Pastorius]]. He formed his own group, and recorded albums that incorporated more commercially accessible melodies, but retained Prime Time's elaborate harmonies.{{sfn|Nicholson|1998|p=313}}

== Legacy ==
In a retrospective article for ''[[The New York Times]]'' on Coleman's work with Prime Time, [[Robert Palmer (writer)|Robert Palmer]] said ''Of Human Feelings'' was still innovative and radical by the standards of other music in 1982, three years after it was recorded.{{sfn|Palmer|1986}} According to Palmer, because writers and musicians had heard its [[white label|test pressing]], the album's mix of jazz improvisation and gritty, punk and funk-derived energy sounded "prophetic" upon its release and was "clearly the progenitor of much that has sounded radically new in the ongoing fusion of punk rock, black dance rhythms, and free jazz".{{sfn|Palmer|1982}} Lloyd Sachs of the ''Chicago Sun-Times'' ranked it eighth on his 1986 list of high-fidelity jazz CDs and wrote that it made the most sense out of Coleman's harmolodic theory.{{sfn|Sachs|1986|p=4}} In a retrospective review for [[AllMusic]], jazz critic [[Scott Yanow]] gave it four stars and wrote that, although they never achieved popularity, Coleman's compositions succeeded within the context of an album that showcased his distinctive saxophone style, which was high-brow yet catchy.{{sfn|Yanow|n.d.}} Jazz journalist [[Todd&nbsp;S. Jenkins]] felt that it was more successful than ''Body Meta'', even though Coleman's simple compositions sounded repetitive and less accessible.{{sfn|Jenkins|2004|p=97}}

According to Joshua Klein of ''[[The A.V. Club]]'', ''Of Human Feelings'' is the best album for new listeners of Coleman's harmolodics-based music.{{sfn|Klein|2002}} Rock critic [[Greg Kot]] of the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' included the album in his guide for novice jazz listeners and named it one of the select albums that helped him both become a better listener of rock music and learn how to enjoy jazz.{{sfn|Kot|1998|p=1}} In 2008, ''[[New York (magazine)|New York]]'' magazine's Martin Johnson included ''Of Human Feelings'' in his list of canonical albums from what he felt had been New York's sceneless yet vital jazz scene in the previous 40 years. He said that the album exudes a spirit of sophistication and elements of funk, Latin, and [[Music of Africa|African music]], all of which are encapsulated by music that retains a jazz identity.{{sfn|Johnson|2008}}
