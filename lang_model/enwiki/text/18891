'''Aang''' is a [[fictional character]] and the main [[protagonist]] for [[Nickelodeon (TV channel)|Nickelodeon's]] [[List of animated television series|animated television series]] ''[[Avatar: The Last Airbender]],'' which was created by [[Michael Dante DiMartino]] and [[Bryan Konietzko]]. He is voiced by [[Zach Tyler Eisen]].

Twelve-year-old Aang is the last surviving [[Airbending|Airbender]], a [[monk]] of the [[Air Nomads]]' Southern Air Temple, and is a [[supercentenarian]] at the incarnation age of 112.<ref name="The Boy in the Iceberg">{{cite episode|title=The Boy in the Iceberg|url=http://www.avatarspiritmedia.net/episode_guide.php?ep=101|airdate=2005-02-21|season=1|number=1|transcripturl=http://www.avatarspiritmedia.net/transcripts.php?ep=101|credits=Director: Dave Filoni, Writers: Michael Dante DiMartino, Bryan Konietzko|series=Avatar: The Last Airbender|serieslink=Avatar: The Last Airbender|network=Nickelodeon}}</ref> He is the current [[Reincarnation|incarnation]] of the [[Avatar]], the spirit of the planet manifested in human form. Aang, as the Avatar, controls the [[Classical element|elements]] and is tasked with keeping the [[Avatar: The Last Airbender#Premise|Four Nations]] at peace.

Aang is the series' [[reluctant hero]] and [[Comic relief|comic]], spending a [[century]] in [[suspended animation]] before joining new friends [[Katara]] and [[Sokka]] on a quest to master the elements and save their world from the war-hungry [[Imperialism|imperialist]] [[Fire Nation]].

== Creation and conception ==
Aang was derived from a sketch created by director Bryan Konietzko as a middle-aged bald man with an arrow on his head.
Konietzko metamorphosized the character into a child shepherding [[bison]] in the sky. Meanwhile, director Michael Dante DiMartino was interested in a documentary about explorers trapped in the [[South Pole]] and the idea caused the pair to think:
{{quote|There's an air guy along with these water people trapped in a snowy wasteland... and maybe some fire people are pressing down on them...|Michael Dante DiMartino and Bryan Konietzko<ref name="NickMagInterview1">{{citation|last=DiMartino|first=Michael Dante|author-link=Michael Dante DiMartino|last2=Konietzko|first2=Bryan|author2-link=Bryan Konietzko|title=In Their Elements|newspaper=Nickelodeon Magazine|pages=6|year=2006|date=Winter 2006|url=http://www.musogato.com/avatar/magazine/avatarmag1_scan08.jpg}}</ref>}}

Originally, Aang was going to be trapped for a thousand years in an [[iceberg]] before waking to a world of new technology, to [[List of Avatar: The Last Airbender major secondary characters#Momo|Momo]] his pet robot, and a dozen flying bison. However, they lost interest in the futuristic theme and they decided on 100 years of suspended animation, a flying [[lemur]] named Momo, and a bison named [[Appa]].<ref name="NickMagInterview1"/>

Many of Aang's beliefs, such as his [[Vegetarianism|vegetarian diet]] and his respect for the planet, are derived from [[Buddhism]] and [[Taoism]].<ref name="NickMagInterview2">{{citation|last=DiMartino|first=Michael Dante|author-link=Michael Dante DiMartino|last2=Konietzko|first2=Bryan|author2-link=Bryan Konietzko|title=Myth Conceptions|newspaper=Nickelodeon Magazine|pages=7|year=2006|date=Winter 2006|url=http://www.musogato.com/avatar/magazine/avatarmag1_scan09.jpg}}</ref> For instance, in the [[Brahmajala Sutta (Theravada)|Brahmajala Sutra]], a Buddhist code of ethics, vegetarianism is encouraged.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.purifymind.com/BrahmaNetSutra.htm|title=Brahmajala Sutra Translated Text|accessdate=2008-02-12|last=Jing|first=Fanwang|format=HTML|publisher=Purify Out Mind|pages=4|language=English|quote=He must not create the causes...and shall not intentionally kill any living creature.}}</ref> Aang's airbending follows an "[[N<U+00E8>iji<U+0101>|internal]]" [[Chinese martial arts]] called [[Baguazhang]], focusing on [[Centrifugal force|centrifugal]] movements to represent air's unpredictability, and does not have many finishing moves, to represent the peaceful belief amongst most airbenders.<ref name="avatar2/index.jhtml">{{cite web | url = http://www.nick.com/all_nick/tv_supersites/avatar2/ | title = Nickelodeon's Official Avatar: The Last Airbender Flash Site | accessdate = 2006-12-02 | publisher = Nick.com}}</ref>

== Plot overview ==
[[Image:Aang-baby.jpg|thumb|left|Newborn Aang]] <!-- Image has fair use rationale. See [[Image:Aang-baby.jpg#Summary]]. -->
=== Beginning ===
At a young age, Aang and the other airbending children travel to the Eastern Air Temple to choose a flying bison partner, named Appa. The elder monks held a private meeting with Aang to reveal his identity as the Avatar. [[List of Avatar: The Last Airbender secondary recurring characters#Monk Gyatso|Monk Gyatso]], Aang's mentor and father-figure, insisted Aang be raised as a regular child.<ref name="The Southern Air Temple">{{cite episode|title=The Southern Air Temple|url=http://www.avatarspiritmedia.net/episode_guide.php?ep=103|airdate=2005-02-25|season=1|number=3|transcripturl=http://www.avatarspiritmedia.net/transcripts.php?ep=103|credits=Director: Lauren MacMullan, Writer: Michael Dante DiMartino|series=Avatar: The Last Airbender|serieslink=Avatar: The Last Airbender|network=Nickelodeon}}</ref> The monks believed Gyatso interfered too much, so they decided to send Aang to the Eastern Air Temple.

When Aang did not want to be torn away from his mentor, he wrote a note for Gyatso and flew away on his bison, Appa. While fleeing the temple, Aang is caught by a violent storm and plummets into the ocean. He entered the [[Avatar State]] unknowingly for the first time, using [[waterbending]] and airbending to encase himself and Appa in a frozen air bubble resembling an iceberg.

=== Book One: Water ===
Aang and Appa are freed by Katara and her brother Sokka after 100 years in the frozen air bubble.<ref name="The Boy in the Iceberg"/> All four characters set off for the [[Water Tribe|Northern Water Tribe]] to find a waterbending master.<ref name="The Avatar Returns">{{cite episode|title=The Avatar Returns|url=http://www.avatarspiritmedia.net/episode_guide.php?ep=102|airdate=2005-02-21|season=1|number=2|transcripturl=http://www.avatarspiritmedia.net/transcripts.php?ep=102|credits=Director: Dave Filoni, Writers: Michael Dante DiMartino, Bryan Konietzko|series=Avatar: The Last Airbender|serieslink=Avatar: The Last Airbender|network=Nickelodeon}}</ref> Aang meets his previous incarnation, [[List of Avatar: The Last Airbender major secondary characters#Avatar Roku|Avatar Roku]], informing him that he must master all four bending arts and defeat [[List of Avatar: The Last Airbender major secondary characters#Fire Lord Ozai|Fire Lord Ozai]] before the return of Sozin's Comet at the end of summer.<ref name="Avatar Roku (Winter Solstice, Part 2)">{{cite episode|title=Avatar Roku (Winter Solstice, Part 2)|url=http://www.avatarspiritmedia.net/episode_guide.php?ep=108|airdate=2005-04-15|season=1|number=8|transcripturl=http://www.avatarspiritmedia.net/transcripts.php?ep=108|credits=Director: Giancarlo Volpe, Writer: Michael Dante DiMartino|series=Avatar: The Last Airbender|serieslink=Avatar: The Last Airbender|network=Nickelodeon}}</ref>

Aang then travels to the Eastern Air Temple to train with [[List of Avatar: The Last Airbender secondary recurring characters#Guru Pathik|Guru Pathik]] in mastering the Avatar State.

=== Book Three: Fire ===
Aang wakes up after spending several weeks in a [[coma]], heavily bandaged with a scar on his back and finds out the world believes he is dead.

Despite the loss of the Earth King's army, Aang and his remaining allies attacked the Fire Nation capital in the Day of Black Sun, but were thwarted by Azula. He had to retreat with his friends to the Western Air Temple.

Aang accepts Zuko's offer to teach him firebending despite the group's reluctance to let their arch-nemesis join. Unfortunately, Zuko is unable to firebend properly, thus Aang and Zuko seek help from the Sun Warriors to discover the original way of firebending.<ref name="The Firebending Masters">{{cite episode|title=The Firebending Masters|url=http://www.avatarspiritmedia.net/episode_guide.php?ep=313|airdate=2007-01-04|season=3|number=13|transcripturl=http://www.avatarspiritmedia.net/transcripts.php?ep=313|credits=Director: Giancarlo Volpe; Writer: John O'Brien|series=Avatar: The Last Airbender|serieslink=Avatar: The Last Airbender|network=Nickelodeon}}</ref>

Aang possesses a deep respect for life and freedom, as evidenced by his vegetarianism<ref name="The King of Omashu">{{cite episode|title=The King of Omashu|url=http://www.avatarspiritmedia.net/episode_guide.php?ep=105|airdate=2005-03-18|season=1|number=5|transcripturl=http://www.avatarspiritmedia.net/transcripts.php?ep=105|credits=Director: Anthony Lioi; Writer: John O'Bryan|series=Avatar: The Last Airbender|serieslink=Avatar: The Last Airbender|network=Nickelodeon}}</ref> and his reluctance to fight.<ref name="The Spirit World (Winter Solstice, Part 1)">{{cite episode|title=The Spirit World (Winter Solstice, Part 1)|url=http://www.avatarspiritmedia.net/episode_guide.php?ep=107|airdate=2005-04-08|season=1|number=7|transcripturl=http://www.avatarspiritmedia.net/transcripts.php?ep=107|credits=Director: Lauren MacMullan; Writer: Aaron Ehasz|series=Avatar: The Last Airbender|serieslink=Avatar: The Last Airbender|network=Nickelodeon}}</ref> Aang prides himself on a complex social network of friends extending over all four nations.<ref name="The Boy in the Iceberg"/>

Aang feels a heavy burden as Avatar.

For example, in "Bato of the Water Tribe," Aang thought Katara and Sokka might leave to visit their father, so Aang hid the map showing his whereabouts and lied about having it in the first place.<ref name="Bato of the Water Tribe">{{cite episode|title=Bato of the Water Tribe|url=http://www.avatarspiritmedia.net/episode_guide.php?ep=115|airdate=2005-10-07|season=1|number=15|transcripturl=http://www.avatarspiritmedia.net/transcripts.php?ep=115|credits=Director: Giancarlo Volpe; Writer: Ian Wilcox|series=Avatar: The Last Airbender|serieslink=Avatar: The Last Airbender|network=Nickelodeon}}</ref>

=== Reception ===
Parents have received Aang<U+2019>s childish nature especially well.

=== Bending ===

<!-- Image has fair use rationale. See [[Image:Reincarnations lowRes.png#Summary]]. -->
Aang, as the reincarnated Avatar, possesses the ability to bend all four elements. Since he is a practitioner of the Chinese martial art of Baguazhang, he is a master at airbending; he can fly by manipulating the air with his own technique, the [[Airbending#The Air Scooter|Air Scooter]], but prefers to [[Airbending#The Glider|hang glide]] or ride on Appa.
Even though naturally gifted in the bending arts as demonstrated in "The Waterbending Scroll",<ref name="The Waterbending Scroll">{{cite episode|title=The Waterbending Scroll|url=http://www.avatarspiritmedia.net/episode_guide.php?ep=109|airdate=2005-04-29|season=1|number=9|transcripturl=http://www.avatarspiritmedia.net/transcripts.php?ep=109|credits=Director: Anthony Lioi; Writer: John O'Bryan|series=Avatar: The Last Airbender|serieslink=Avatar: The Last Airbender|network=Nickelodeon}}</ref> Aang's lack of focus has allowed Katara to surpass him in water manipulating skills; as a result she taught Aang waterbending. Aang had difficulty learning earthbending's offensive techniques from Toph in ''Bitter Work,'' preferring his habitual evasive maneuvers.

In the first season, Aang had little skill with fire, having received a rudimentary object lesson in breath control and firebending. After burning Katara, he vowed to never firebend again. In "The Western Air Temple", Zuko joins the group and offers to teach him firebending. Aang, at first, rejected him, but when he realizes that Zuko understands that he needs control over his bending or he would hurt other people, Aang accepts him as his teacher. After two dragons teach Aang the meaning of firebending, he is able to shoot out a large blast of fire with no apparent effort.<ref name="The Firebending Masters"/>

In "The Deserter", Jeong Jeong says that to master firebending, Aang, as the Avatar, will need to first master the other bending arts in their natural order--air, water, earth, and fire--implying that the disciplines of one bending art will support the disciplines of the next bending art in order--'evade and avoid' - 'redirect and turn against the opponent' - 'standing one's ground and enduring' and 'pre-emptive first strike'. In ''Bitter Work'', Iroh comments:
{{quote|It is important to draw wisdom from many different places. If we take it from only one place, it becomes rigid and stale. Understanding others, the other elements, and the other nations will help you become whole...It is the combination of the four elements in one person that makes the Avatar so powerful.|Iroh<ref name="Bitter Work">{{cite episode|title=Bitter Work|url=http://www.avatarspiritmedia.net/episode_guide.php?ep=209|airdate=2006-06-02|season=2|number=9|transcripturl=http://www.avatarspiritmedia.net/transcripts.php?ep=209|credits=Director: Ethan Spaulding; Writer: Aaron Ehasz|series=Avatar: The Last Airbender|serieslink=Avatar: The Last Airbender|network=Nickelodeon}}</ref>

=== Spirit ===
Aang often receives advice and guidance from Avatar Roku, the previous incarnation. He has guided Aang several times, appearing to Jeong Jeong to persuade him to teach Aang,<ref name="The Deserter">{{cite episode|title=The Deserter|url=http://www.avatarspiritmedia.net/episode_guide.php?ep=116|airdate=2005-10-21|season=1|number=16|transcripturl=http://www.avatarspiritmedia.net/transcripts.php?ep=116|credits=Director: Lauren MacMullan; Writer: Tim Hedrick|series=Avatar: The Last Airbender|serieslink=Avatar: The Last Airbender|network=Nickelodeon}}</ref> offering critical wisdom in the ways of the [[Spirit World (Avatar: The Last Airbender)|spirit world]] during "The Siege of the North",<ref name="The Siege of the North Part 2">{{cite episode|title=The Siege of the North, Part II|url=http://www.avatarspiritmedia.net/episode_guide.php?ep=120|airdate=2005-12-02|season=1|number=20|transcripturl=http://www.avatarspiritmedia.net/transcripts.php?ep=120|credits=Director: Dave Filoni; Writer: Aaron Ehasz|series=Avatar: The Last Airbender|serieslink=Avatar: The Last Airbender|network=Nickelodeon}}</ref> and most importantly, revealing to Aang the nature of the Avatar State.<ref name="The Avatar State"/> After receiving a letter from Guru Pathik in "The Earth King",<ref name="The Earth King">{{cite episode|title=The Earth King|series=Avatar: The Last Airbender|serieslink=Avatar: The Last Airbender|airdate=2006-11-16|season=2|number=18|url=http://www.avatarspiritmedia.net/episode_guide.php?218|transcripturl=http://www.avatarspiritmedia.net/transcripts.php?218}}</ref> Aang journeys to the [[Air Nomads#Eastern Air Temple|Eastern Air Temple]] to learn to control the Avatar State. Guru Pathik reveals that the secret of entering, controlling, and leaving the Avatar State by free will lay in the 'releasing' of seven chakras. Aang struggles with the seventh - earthly attachments, namely, his love for Katara. Guru Pathik states that Aang's refusal to let Katara go has 'locked the final chakra,' disallowing him to enter the Avatar State.<ref name="The Guru"/> However, in "The Crossroads of Destiny", Aang attempts to open the seventh chakra and enter the Avatar State after the realization that he cannot win the fight against Zuko, Azula and the [[Earth Kingdom#Dai Li|Dai Li]]. Once again, Aang was unsuccessful to achieve the mastery when Azula attacked him from behind, disrupting the process. From that point on, Aang has no longer been able to access the Avatar State.

=== Medium ===
Aang has the capacity to act as a [[Mediumship|medium]], a bridge between the mortal world and the spirit world, the plane of existence where the universe's disembodied spirits dwell. Through inducing a deep [[Meditation|meditative]] state, Aang can separate from his body and travel the physical world's [[astral plane]] in [[Astral body|astral form]],<ref name="The Spirit World (Winter Solstice, Part 1)"/> or, with the help of a gateway, travel to the spirit world. Once in the spirit world, Aang can travel freely and communicate with beings such as Avatar Roku or Koh the Face Stealer. This position as intermediary also allows him to channel spirits while in the Avatar State.

== Appearances in other media ==
Aang has appeared in the [[Avatar: The Last Airbender Trading Card Game]] on a multitude of cards.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.prnewswire.com/cgi-bin/stories.pl?ACCT=104&STORY=/www/story/01-24-2006/0004266998&EDATE=|title=Upper Deck Entertainment Teams Up With Nickelodeon to Produce New Trading Card Game Based on the Wildly Popular Animated Series 'Avatar: The Last Airbender'<!-- Bot generated title -->|accessdate=2008-02-11|date=2006-01-24|format=HTML|publisher=PR Newswire|language=English}}</ref> He also appeared in the [[Avatar: The Last Airbender (video game)|''Avatar: The Last Airbender'' video game]], released for various consoles, as one of the four [[Player character|playable characters]] in each game.

=== ''Escape from the Spirit World'' ===
''Escape from the Spirit World'' is an online video game that can be found on Nickelodeon's official website. The game includes certain plot changes that are not shown in the show, with the show's directors Michael DiMartino and Bryan Konietzko claiming the events are part of canon.<ref name="EscapeFromSpiritWorldGame">{{cite web|url=http://www.nick.com/avatarescape/index.jhtml|title=Avatar Escape From The Spirit World|accessdate=2008-02-19|coauthors=Nickelodeon|format=Adobe Flash File|publisher=Viacom Corporation}}</ref><ref name="AvatarWiki-VideoGame">{{cite encyclopedia|author=Avatar Wiki contributors|encyclopedia=Avatar Wiki|title=Escape from the Spirit World|url=http://avatar.wikia.com/index.php?title=Escape_from_the_Spirit_World&oldid=12044|accessdate=2008-02-18|date=2008-02-10|year=[[2008]]|publisher=Wikia|quote=The game is meant to explain the events between the end of Book 2- The Crossroads of Destiny and the start of Book 3- The Awakening.}}</ref>

In the game, Aang speaks with past Avatars in an effort to heal the Avatar Spirit. He met Avatar Roku, Avatar Kyoshi, Avatar Kuruk, and Avatar Yangchen. In the first chapter, Aang encounters Roku; Roku discusses with Aang about how he had trouble with the Avatar State also, and had caused great destruction trying to master it. Next, Aang meets with Avatar Kyoshi, who tells Aang that she had created the Dai Li, which Aang would have a lot of trouble with in the second season. In the third chapter, Aang meets Avatar Kuruk, who tells a story about how he is searching for his wife, whom Koh the Face Stealer had taken in vengeance for Kuruk's conceited personality. This reveals certain mysteries from when Aang himself went to the Spirit World to talk to Koh. Finally, Aang speaks with Avatar Yangchen, who summarizes the lesson that Aang should have learned from speaking with the other Avatars. As the game concludes, Avatar Yangchen tells Aang that he will remember none of what had happened when he awakes.<ref name="EscapeFromSpiritWorldGame"/><ref name="AvatarWiki-VideoGame"/>
