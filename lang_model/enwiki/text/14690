== Creation of General Relativity ==
=== Early investigations ===
As [[Albert Einstein]] later said, the reason for the development of [[general relativity]] was that the preference of inertial motions within [[special relativity]] was unsatisfactory, while a theory which from the outset prefers no state of motion (even accelerated ones) should appear more satisfactory.<ref>Albert Einstein, [http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1921/einstein-lecture.html Nobel lecture] in 1921</ref> So in [[1908]] he published an article on acceleration under [[special relativity]]. In that article, he argued that [[free fall]] is really inertial motion, and that for a freefalling observer the rules of special relativity must apply.  This argument is called the [[Equivalence principle]].  In the same article, Einstein also predicted the phenomenon of [[gravitational time dilation]].  In [[1911]], Einstein published another article expanding on the 1907 article, in which additional effects such as the [[Gravitational lensing|deflection of light]] by massive bodies were predicted.

General relativity (GR) is a theory of gravitation that was developed by Albert Einstein between 1907 and 1915. According to general relativity, the observed gravitational attraction between masses results from the warping of space and time by those masses.

Before the advent of general relativity, Newton's law of universal gravitation had been accepted for more than two hundred years as a valid description of the gravitional force between masses. Under Newton's model, gravity was the result of an attractive force between massive objects. Although even Newton was bothered by the unknown nature of that force, the basic framework was extremely successful at describing motion.

However, experiments and observations show that Einstein's description accounts for several effects that are unexplained by Newton's law, such as minute anomalies in the orbits of Mercury and other planets. General relativity also predicts novel effects of gravity, such as gravitational waves, gravitational lensing and an effect of gravity on time known as gravitational time dilation. Many of these predictions have been confirmed by experiment, while others are the subject of ongoing research. For example, although there is indirect evidence for gravitational waves, direct evidence of their existence is still being sought by several teams of scientists in experiments such as the LIGO and GEO 600 projects.

General relativity has developed into an essential tool in modern astrophysics. It provides the foundation for the current understanding of black holes, regions of space where gravitational attraction is so strong that not even light can escape. Their strong gravity is thought to be responsible for the intense radiation emitted by certain types of astronomical objects (such as active galactic nuclei or microquasars). General relativity is also part of the framework of the standard Big Bang model of cosmology.

=== General covariance and the hole argument ===
By 1912, Einstein was actively seeking a theory in which [[gravitation]] was explained as a [[geometric]] phenomenon. At the urging of [[Tullio Levi-Civita]], Einstein began by exploring the use of [[general covariance]] (which is essentially the use of curvature [[tensors]]) to create a gravitational theory.  However, in [[1913]] Einstein abandoned that approach, arguing that it is inconsistent based on the "[[hole argument]]".  In 1914 and much of 1915, Einstein was trying to create [[field equations]] based on another approach.  When that approach was proven to be inconsistent, Einstein revisited the concept of general covariance and discovered that the hole argument was flawed.

=== The development of the Einstein Field Equations ===
When Einstein realized that general covariance was actually tenable, he quickly completed the development of the field equations that are named after him. However, he made a now-famous mistake. The field equations he published in October 1915 were

:<math>R_{\mu\nu} =  T_{\mu\nu}\,</math>,

where <math>R_{\mu\nu}</math> is the [[Ricci tensor]], and <math>T_{\mu\nu}</math> the [[energy-momentum tensor]]. This predicted the non-[[Classical mechanics|Newtonian]] [[perihelion precession]] of [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]], and so had Einstein very excited.  However, it was soon realized that they were inconsistent with the local [[conservation of energy-momentum]] unless the universe had a constant density of mass-energy-momentum.  In other words, air, rock and even a vacuum should all have the same density!  This inconsistency with observation sent Einstein back to the drawing board.  However, the solution was all but obvious, and in November 1915 Einstein published the actual Einstein field equations:

:<math>R_{\mu\nu} - {1\over 2}R g_{\mu\nu} = T_{\mu\nu}</math>,

where <math>R</math> is the [[Ricci scalar]] and <math>g_{\mu\nu}</math> the [[metric tensor]]. With the publication of the field equations, the issue became one of solving them for various cases and interpreting the solutions.  This and experimental verification have dominated general relativity research ever since.

=== Einstein and Hilbert ===
{{seealso|relativity priority dispute}}
Although Einstein is credited with finding the field equations, the German mathematician [[David Hilbert]] published them in an article before Einstein's article. This has resulted in accusations of [[plagiarism]] against Einstein (never from Hilbert), and assertions that the field equations should be called the "Einstein-Hilbert field equations".  However, Hilbert did not press his claim for priority and some have asserted that Einstein submitted the correct equations before Hilbert amended his own work to include them. This suggests that Einstein developed the correct field equations first, though Hilbert may have reached them later independently (or even learned of them afterwards through his correspondence with Einstein).<ref>Leo Corry, J<U+00FC>rgen Renn, John Stachel: "Belated Decision in the Hilbert-Einstein Priority Dispute",  SCIENCE, Vol. 278, [[14 November]][[1997]] - [http://www.tau.ac.il/~corry/publications/articles/science.html article text]</ref> However, others have critizised those assertions.<ref>[http://physics.unr.edu/faculty/winterberg/Hilbert-Einstein.pdf Friedwart Winterberg's response to the Cory-Renn-Stachel paper] as printed in "Zeitschrift f<U+00FC>r Naturforschung" [http://www.znaturforsch.com/c59a.htm 59a], 715-719.</ref>

===Sir Arthur Eddington===
In the early years after Einstein's theory was published, [[Arthur Eddington|Sir Arthur Eddington]] lent his considerable prestige in the British scientific establishment in an effort to champion the work of this German scientist.  Because the theory was so complex and abstruse (even today it is popularly considered the pinnacle of scientific thinking; in the early years it was even more so), it was rumored that only three people in the world understood it.  There was an illuminating, though probably apocryphal, anecdote about this.  As related by [[Ludwik Silberstein]],<ref>John Waller (2002), ''Einstein's Luck'', Oxford University Press, ISBN 0-19-860719-9</ref> during one of Eddington's lectures he asked "Professor Eddington, you must be one of three persons in the world who understands  general relativity."  Eddington paused, unable to answer. Silberstein continued "Don't be modest, Eddington!" Finally, Eddington replied "On the contrary, I'm trying to think who the third person is."

== Solutions ==
=== The Schwarzschild solution ===
Since the field equations are [[non-linear]], Einstein assumed that they were insoluble.  However, in [[1916]] [[Karl Schwarzschild]] discovered an [[exact solution]] for the case of a spherically symmetric [[spacetime]] surrounding a massive object in [[spherical coordinates]].  This is now known as the [[Schwarzschild solution]].  Since then, many other exact solutions have been found.

=== The expanding universe and the cosmological constant ===
{{main|cosmological constant}}
In [[1922]], [[Alexander Friedmann]] found a solution in which the universe may expand or contract, and later [[Georges Lema<U+00EE>tre]] derived a solution for an expanding universe.  However, Einstein believed that the universe was apparently static, and since a static cosmology was not supported by the general relativistic field equations, he added a [[cosmological constant]] <U+039B> to the field equations, which became

:<math>R_{\mu\nu} - {1\over 2}R g_{\mu\nu} + \Lambda g_{\mu\nu} = T_{\mu\nu}</math>.

This permitted the creation of steady-state solutions, but they were unstable: the slightest perturbation of a static state would result in the universe expanding or contracting. In [[1929]], [[Edwin Hubble]] found evidence for the idea that the universe is expanding. This resulted in Einstein dropping the cosmological constant, referring to it as "the biggest blunder in my career". At the time, it was an [[ad hoc]] hypothesis to add in the cosmological constant, as it was only intended to justify one result (a static universe).

=== More exact solutions ===
Progress in solving the field equations and understanding the solutions has been ongoing.  The solution for a spherically symmetric charged object was discovered by Reissner and later rediscovered by Nordstr<U+00F6>m, and is called the [[Reissner-Nordstr<U+00F6>m black hole|Reissner-Nordstr<U+00F6>m solution]].  The black hole aspect of the Schwarzschild solution was very controversial, and Einstein did not believe that singularities could be real.  However, in [[1957]] (two years after Einstein's death in [[1955]]), [[Martin Kruskal]] published a proof that black holes are called for by the Schwarzschild Solution.  Additionally, the solution for a rotating massive object was obtained by [[Roy Kerr|Kerr]] in the 1960s and is called the [[Kerr solution]].  The [[Kerr-Newman solution]] for a rotating, charged massive object was published a few years later.

== Testing the theory ==
{{Main|Tests of general relativity}}
The perihelion precession of Mercury was the first evidence that general relativity is correct. Sir [[Arthur Stanley Eddington]]'s 1919 expedition in which he confirmed Einstein's prediction for the deflection of light by the Sun helped to cement the status of general relativity as a likely true theory. Since then many observations have confirmed the correctness of [[general relativity]]. These include studies of [[binary pulsar]]s, observations of radio signals passing the limb of the Sun, and even the [[GPS]] system. For more information, see the [[Tests of general relativity]] article.

== Alternative theories ==
{{Main|Alternatives to general relativity}}
Finally, there have been various attempts through the years to find modifications to general relativity.  The most famous of these are the [[Brans-Dicke theory]] (also known as [[scalar-tensor theory]]), and [[Rosen's bimetric theory]].  Both of these proposed changes to the field equations, and both suffer from these changes permitting the presence of bipolar gravitational radiation.  As a result, Rosen's original theory has been refuted by observations of binary pulsars. As for Brans-Dicke (which has a tunable parameter ''<U+03C9>'' such that ''<U+03C9> = <U+221E>'' is the same as general relativity), the amount by which it can differ from general relativity has been severely constrained by these observations.   However, general relativity and [[quantum mechanics]] (a theory that has been experimentally verified more than GR) are known to be inconsistent. Much speculation exists that modifications of GR (but not QM) are needed on the smallest scales (as GR has not been tested rigorously on the smallest scales). In the other camp, speculation exists that QM needs to be modified (for example, it usually assumes a fixed (flat) spacetime background). Most researchers believe that both theories are in need of modification.
