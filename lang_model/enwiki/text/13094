'''Interstate 294''' (I-294) is a tolled [[Interstate Highway]] in northeastern [[Illinois]], [[U.S.A.]]. It forms the southern portion of the [[Tri-State Tollway]] in Illinois. I-294 runs from [[South Holland, Illinois|South Holland]] at Interstates [[Interstate 80|80]] and [[Interstate 94|94]], and [[Illinois Route 394]] to [[Deerfield, Illinois|Deerfield]] at I-94. Interstate 294 is {{convert|53.42|mi|km|2}} long; {{convert|5.32|mi|km|2}} are shared with I-80.<ref name="t2" /> It serves as a bypass around the city of [[Chicago, Illinois|Chicago]].

==Route description==
{{main|Tri-State Tollway}}
Interstate 294 has four of the Tri-State Tollway's five mainline barriers. These are located at:
* 163rd Street
* 82nd Street (Southbound)/83rd Street (Northbound)
* [[Cermak Road]]
* Irving Park Road ([[Illinois Route 19]]) (Southbound)/ Touhy Ave. (Northbound)

The fifth is on I-94 near Waukegan.

The full length of Interstate 294 is 8 lanes wide (4 lanes each direction). Prior to 2006, only the portion between O'Hare ([[Jane Addams Memorial Tollway|Interstate 90]]) and 95th Street ([[U.S. Highway 12|U.S. 12]]/[[U.S. Highway 20|U.S. 20]]) was 8 lanes, with the remainder being 6 lanes. In 2009, The Illinois Tollway Authority completed reconstruction on the remainder of Interstate 294, expanding the tollway from 6 to 8 lanes from 95th Street to its Southern terminus at the [[Kingery Expressway]], and from Interstate 90 to its Northern terminus at [[Interstate 94]] in [[Deerfield, IL|Deerfield]].

==History==
The portion of the [[Borman Expressway]] that was completed from Gary westward and the [[Kingery Expressway]] were originally designated as I-80, 90, and 294 from shortly after the Interstate Highway program was enacted until about 1965, when the connection between the Borman and the [[Indiana Toll Road]] was completed, and I-90 was swapped with I-94 west of that junction, cutting back I-294 to its current south terminus. [[Indiana]] later proposed to extend Interstate 294 east on the current Borman Expressway to [[Indiana State Route 912]], before having it turn north at that point, west at [[U.S. Highway 12]], and then back to I-94, most likely somewhere on the [[Bishop Ford Expressway]] near 130th Street. The request was denied.

From 1991-1993, the 23 mile portion of Interstate 294 between Interstate 90 and [[U.S. Route 12 in Illinois|U.S. Route 12]]/[[U.S. Route 20 in Illinois|U.S. Route 20]] (95th Street) was reconstructed and expanded from 6 to 8 lanes in each direction.<ref>{{cite news |author=P. Davis Szymczak |title=Widening of Tri-State could begin in October |date=September 27, 1991 |accessdate=April 18, 2010 |work=Chicago Tribune |url=http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/chicagotribune/access/24500899.html?dids=24500899:24500899&FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT&type=current&date=Sep+27%2C+1991&author=P.+Davis+Szymczak.&pub=Chicago+Tribune+%28pre-1997+Fulltext%29&desc=Widening+of+Tri-State+could+begin+in+October&pqatl=google}}</ref> In 2006, reconstruction to widen the Southern portion of the tollway, where I-80 and I-294 are multiplexed, was completed in conjunction with simultaneous projects on the Borman and Kingery Expressways, expanding this portion of the tollway from 6 to 8 lanes. By late 2009, additional reconstruction projects on the remainder of the tollway were completed, bringing the entire length of Interstate 294 to 8 lanes wide (4 lanes each direction).

Interstate 294 was built largely before the growth and maturation of the suburbs that run along Interstate 294. As a result, the vast majority of the interchanges are partial, or were configured to have entrance ramps feeding the toll plazas. "Gaps" between exit ramps are common, the 9.5 mile (15.3 kilometer) gap between Cicero Avenue (Illinois 50/83) and 95th Street (U.S. 12/20) being one of the more notable ones. Partial interchanges are located at [[Roosevelt Road]] ([[Illinois Route 38]]) (southbound exit, northbound entrance), Irving Park Road (Illinois 19) (southbound exit, northbound entrance), Touhy Avenue (northbound exit, southbound entrance), Dempster Street (U.S. 14) (northbound exit, southbound entrance), and Golf Road (Illinois 58) (southbound exit, northbound entrance). Several former partial interchanges have been converted to full interchanges, with automated toll collection facilities on the new ramps, such as at 159th Street (U.S. 6) (northbound on and southbound off added), and 95th Street (U.S. 12/20) (southbound on and northbound off added). The 79th Street exit was moved to 75th Street/Willow Springs Road, and made a complete interchange in the same manner.

==Future==
{{As of|2009}}, Interstate 294 has no interchange on [[Interstate 57]], although one is being considered. This is one of the only places that two Interstate Highways cross but do not feature connecting ramps. Plans for the interchange are currently at PE 1, or preliminary engineering, but have been repeatedly put on hold due to insufficient funding since 1993. In 2006, a consortium of south suburbs again pushed the [[Illinois Department of Transportation]] and the Tollway Authority to construct the interchange, whose construction costs are now estimated at between $235 million and $250 million USD.<ref>{{cite news |author=Ziemba, Stanley |title=South suburbs join to make a connection |publisher=Chicago Tribune |date=2006-05-09 |accessdate=2006-05-09 |url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/local/chi-0605090138may09,1,1392087.story?coll=chi-news-hed}}</ref>
