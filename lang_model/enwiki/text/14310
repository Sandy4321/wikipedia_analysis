The '''BMW Art Car''' Project was introduced by the French racecar driver and auctioneer [[Herv<U+00E9> Poulain]], who wanted to invite an artist to create a canvas on an automobile. It was in 1975, when Poulain commissioned American artist and friend Alexander Calder to paint the first [[BMW]] Art Car. This first example would be a BMW 3.0 CSL which Poulain himself would race in the 1975 Le Mans endurance race.<ref>[http://www.bmwgroup.com/bmwgroup_prod/e/0_0_www_bmwgroup_com/verantwortung/kultur/bildende_kunst/bmw_art_car.html 'BMW Art Cars page, BMW website']</ref> Since Calder's work of art, many other renowned artists throughout the world have created BMW Art Cars, including  [[David Hockney]], [[Jenny Holzer]], [[Roy Lichtenstein]], [[Robert Rauschenberg]], [[Frank Stella]], and [[Andy Warhol]]. To date, a total of 17 BMW Art Cars, based on both racing and regular production vehicles, have been created. The most recent artist to the join BMW Art Car program is [[Robin Rhode]] in 2009 with his "Expression of Joy" painting, using a BMW Z4. Artists for the BMW Art Car Project are chosen by a panel of international judges.

According to Thomas Girst, who has been in charge of the BMW Art Cars project since 2004, the purpose of the project has changed over time: "In the beginning the cars were raced. There wasn't much of a public relations effort around them... Since then, some of the Art Cars have been used in advertisements to show that BMW is a player in the arts. With the Eliason work, part of what we are doing is raising awareness of alternative and renewable energy sources."<ref>Preece, R.J. (June 11, 2009).

<nowiki>*</nowiki> The 2009 project by Robin Rhode did not create an art car, but rather used a BMW Z4 driven over a giant canvas to create a work by applying paint with the car's tires.

==Miniatures==
Between 2003 and 2005, BMW released the first 15 Art Cars (at the time, this encompassed the entire series) as [[1:18 scale]] miniature diecast vehicles, manufactured by [[Minichamps]]. The first two to be released were [[Alexander Calder|Alexander Calder's]] [[BMW 3.0 CSL]] and [[Jenny Holzer|Jenny Holzer's]] [[BMW V12 LMR]]. The Art Cars were sold through BMW Automobile Dealerships, select Museum shops, as well as directly from BMW. Initially 9,001 copies were to be produced with an MSRP of $125 (now $145) each.<ref>[http://www.worldcarfans.com/2030618.001/bmw-introduces-scale-models-of-art-cars 'BMW introduces scale models of art cars'] <em>Worldcarfans.com</em>.
