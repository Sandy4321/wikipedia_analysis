'''''One Foot in the Grave''''' is a [[BBC television]] [[British sitcom|sitcom]] series written by [[David Renwick]]. The show ran for six series, including seven Christmas specials, two [[Comic Relief]] specials, over an eleven-year period, from early 1990 to late 2000. The latter Comic Relief special was shown after the series officially ended in spring 2001.

The series features the exploits of [[Victor Meldrew]], played by [[Richard Wilson (Scottish actor)|Richard Wilson]], and his long-suffering wife, Margaret, played by [[Annette Crosbie]]. The programmes invariably deal with Meldrew's battle against the problems he creates for himself. Living in a typical household in an unnamed English suburb, Victor takes involuntary early retirement. His various efforts to keep himself busy, while encountering various misfortunes and misunderstandings are the themes of the sitcom. The series was largely filmed on location in Walkford, near [[New Milton]] in Hampshire, although several clues show that the series may have been set in [[Hampshire]]{{spaced ndash}}possibly [[Winchester]].<ref>''One Foot in the Grave'' Series 6 DVD Commentary</ref> Despite its traditional production, the series supplants its domestic sitcom setting with elements of [[Black comedy|black humour]] and [[Surreal humour|surrealism]].

The series was occasionally the subject of controversy for some of its darker story elements, but was nevertheless the recipient of a number of awards, including the 1992 [[BAFTA]] for Best Comedy. In 2004, the series came tenth in a 2004 BBC poll to find "[[Britain's Best Sitcom]]". The programme also came 80th in the [[British Film Institute]]'s [[100 Greatest British Television Programmes]].<ref name="BFI TV100">[http://www.bfi.org.uk/features/tv/100/list/list.php BFI TV100], URL accessed 8 June 2006</ref> The series, originally shown on [[BBC One]], is now available on DVD and is regularly repeated in the United Kingdom on [[Gold (TV channel)|Gold]]. Seven episodes were remade for [[BBC Radio 2]]<ref name="bbc">{{Cite web|first=Mark |last=Lewisohn |title=One Foot In The Grave |work=The former BBC Guide to Comedy |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/comedy/guide/articles/o/onefootinthegrav_7774990.shtml |accessdate=2007-05-14 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20050417222957/http://www.bbc.co.uk/comedy/guide/articles/o/onefootinthegrav_7774990.shtml |archivedate=2005-04-17}}</ref> and the series also inspired a novel.

== Plot ==
{{Main|List of One Foot in the Grave episodes}}

The series features the exploits of irascible pensioner Victor Meldrew, who after being forced to retire from his job as a security guard, finds himself at war with the world and everything in it. Meldrew, cursed with misfortune and always complaining, is married to long-suffering wife Margaret, who is often left exasperated by his many misfortunes.<ref name="bbc"/>

Amongst other witnesses to Victor's wrath are tactless family friend Jean Warboys, and next-door couple Patrick (Victor's nemesis) and Pippa Trench. Patrick often discovers Victor in inexplicably bizarre or compromising situations, leading him to believe that he is insane. The Meldrews' neighbour on the other side, overly cheery charity worker Nick Swainey, also adds to Victor's frustration.

Although set in a traditional suburban setting somewhere in Essex past Basildon (mentioned in 'Starbound'), the show subverts this genre with a strong overtone of [[black comedy]]. Season One's "The Valley Of Fear" is an episode which caused controversy, when Victor finds a frozen cat in his freezer. Writer David Renwick also combined [[farce]] with elements of [[tragedy]].<ref name="screenonline">{{Cite web|first=Phil |last=Wickham |title=One Foot In The Grave (1990-2000) |work=BFI: ScreenOnline |url=http://www.screenonline.org.uk/tv/id/579040/index.html |accessdate=2007-05-14}}</ref> For example in the [[Things Aren't Simple Any More|final episode]], Victor is killed by a hit-and-run driver, and although there is no explicit reference that Victor and Margaret had children, the episode "Timeless Time" contained a reference to someone named Stuart; the strong implication being that they once had a son who had died as a child.<ref name="bbc"/><ref>{{Cite news|last= Smith |first= Rupert|title= The bitter end: Last night's TV |work= [[The Guardian]] |date=2000-11-21 |accessdate=2007-05-21}}</ref><ref name = "connections"/>

A number of episodes were also experimental in that they took place [[bottle episode|entirely in one setting]]. Such episodes include: Victor, Margaret, and Mrs Warboys stuck in a traffic jam;<ref name="beast"/> Victor and Margaret in bed suffering insomnia;<ref>"Timeless Time"</ref> Victor left alone in the house waiting to see if he has to take part in [[jury service]]; Victor and Margaret having a long wait in their solicitor's waiting room; and Victor and Margaret trying to cope during a power cut on the hottest night of the year.

== Characters ==
{{refimprove section|date=March 2011}}

=== Main characters ===

'''[[Victor Meldrew]]''' ([[Richard Wilson (Scottish actor)|Richard Wilson]]) <U+2013> Victor is the main protagonist of the sitcom and finds himself constantly battling against all that life throws at him as he becomes entangled, like the pawn he is, in [[machiavellian]] plots. Renwick once pointed out in an interview that the name "Victor" was ironic, since he almost always ends up a loser.<ref>''[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0268378/ I Don't Believe It! The 'One Foot in the Grave' Story]'', BBC documentary, 2000</ref> From being buried alive, to being prosecuted for attacking a feisty pit bull terrier with a collection of coconut meringues, Victor tries to adjust to life after his infamous replacement by a "box" at his place of employment, but to no avail.
He believes that everything is going wrong for him all the time, and he has the right to be angry and upset because it's not his fault it's every one else's fault.
Victor is a tragic comedy character and sympathy is directed towards him as he becomes embroiled in complex misunderstandings, bureaucratic vanity and, at times, sheer bad luck. The audience sees a philosophical ebb to his character, however, along with a degree of optimism, yet his polite fa<U+00E7>ade collapses when events get the better of him, and a full verbal onslaught is forthcoming. "Victor-isms" include "I do not believe it!", "I don't believe it!", "Un-be-lievable!"

'''[[Margaret Meldrew]] (n<U+00E9>e Pellow)''' ([[Annette Crosbie]]) <U+2013> Victor's long-suffering, tolerant and kind-hearted wife, Margaret tries to maintain a degree of calmness and to rise above her husband's frustrations. However, she is too often engulfed in the same folly and often vents her anger, usually at Victor who bears the brunt of it all. In early episodes, her character acts more as a [[double act|comic foil]] to Victor's misfortunes, for example asking if a cat found frozen in their freezer is definitely dead and mentioning a friend who died of a terminal illness. When Victor reminds her that the woman actually fell from a cliff, Margaret retorts she only did so because "she went to the seaside to convalesce".

In later episodes, Margaret develops into a more complex character. She is shown to be fiercely protective of her marriage to Victor, becoming easily suspicious and jealous, for example, of a Dutch marionette that Victor becomes occupied with repairing in the episode "Hole in the Sky", eventually leading her to destroy it. In "The Affair of the Hollow Lady", a greengrocer develops a liking for Victor and wrongly attempts to convince Margaret that he has been unfaithful to her. In revenge, Margaret assaults the woman with a pair of [[boxing gloves]]. However, Margaret herself is shown to have contemplated infidelity with a man she met on holiday in the episode "Warm Champagne", eventually deciding against it. She sums up her relationship with Victor in this episode by telling Ben (her admirer) "Victor's the most sensitive person I know - and that's why I love him. And why I continually want to ram his head through a television screen".

'''Jean Warboys''' ([[Doreen Mantle]]) <U+2013> Mrs Warboys is a friend of Margaret (and a rather annoying one in Victor's eyes) who attached herself to the Meldrews, accompanying them on many of their exploits. In the early series she was married to ([[unseen character|never seen]]) Chris, but eventually he left her for the private detective she had hired when she suspected him of having an affair, and they divorced.

She often bears the brunt of Victor's temper due to muddled misunderstandings and in part due to her aloof nature. One such occasion saw her goading Victor into taking a dog whose owner had just died. She had not told him that it was stuffed, much to Victor's annoyance, as he had spent time constructing an expensive kennel for it. On another occasion she had a waxwork made of herself which had to be delivered to their house as she had been involved in a road accident. As it turned out, she hated it as much as Victor and Margaret did, and that particular episode finished with the waxwork standing in the dustbin. Despite being friends with Margaret, she has driven Margaret mad a few times, notably in "Only a Story", when she moved in with the Meldrews after her flat had been flooded and drove Margaret to the point of distraction with her complaining and laziness. She would often bore the Meldrews by showing them her complete collection of holiday pictures at the most unwelcome times. A running joke is her beating Victor at board-games, including Trivial Pursuit and chess. In "Hearts of Darkness" Mrs Warboys appears to know the answer to every question and in "Tales of Terror" she continually checks Victor while appearing to pay no attention to the game.  Doreen Mantle described her character as "wanting to do the right thing but always finding out that it was the wrong thing".<ref>"I Don't Believe It!: The One Foot in the Grave story", documentary, BBC Worldwide 2005.</ref>

'''Patrick Trench''' ([[Angus Deayton]]) <U+2013> Patrick and his wife Pippa live next door to Victor, and often catches Victor engrossed in seemingly preposterous situations, all of which in context are revealed as perfectly innocuous. The couple's relationship with their neighbours begins badly after Victor mistakes Patrick and Pippa for distant relations when they arrive outside with three suitcases{{spaced ndash}}not realising that they are his next-door neighbours, having been on a lengthy holiday since Victor and Margaret moved in. Victor subsequently invites the bemused pair to stay; this and later incidents cause Patrick to suspect that Victor is quite insane, possibly bordering on malicious. 

However, Patrick's rift with Victor eventually transforms him into a rather cynical character (much like Victor), and he often responds to him in similarly vindictive ways as a means of trying to settle the score; for example, by complaining via post-it notes. This aspect of Patrick's character came to a head in the episode "The Executioner's Song" where his face transforms into an apparition of Victor's as he gazes into a mirror.

'''Pippa Trench (n<U+00E9>e Croker)''' ([[Janine Duvitski]]) <U+2013> Patrick's wife sought friendly relations with the Meldrews and, after a while, became good friends with Margaret. The two women usually attempt to get the men to make peace with each other at least once per series. Eventually Patrick proposes that the Trenches move house, but they soon realise that the Meldrew curse has followed them: Victor sent workmen to their home next door, thinking they were removal men who had come to the wrong house. They were in fact from a [[house clearance]] firm Margaret had employed to clear her late cousin Ursula's country mansion. It turned out that the workmen had cleared Patrick and Pippa's house of their entire furniture and sold it for a mere four hundred and seventy five pounds. Pippa is slightly dim-witted (once described by Victor as a "gormless twerp" on an answering machine message, unaware she was listening){{spaced ndash}}for example, believing Victor had murdered an elderly blind man simply because the victim had been found clutching a double-one [[domino]] in his hand, and Victor had two pimples on his nose.

New neighbours Derek and Betty McVitie replaced the Trenches for the 1997 special "Endgame", however this turned out to be their only appearances in the series and they were said to have emigrated by the penultimate episode which caused Nick Swainey to leap straight in with the offer for their old house. Series six saw the Trenches return as prominent characters, albeit living in a house some distance from the Meldrews. Despite appearing in five out of six series and three Christmas specials, neither of the Trenches ever share a scene with either Mrs Warboys or Mr Swainey.

'''Nick Swainey''' ([[Owen Brenman]]) <U+2013> The excessively cheerful and often oblivious character appeared in the first episode, encouraging Victor to join his OAPs' trip to Eastbourne. When the Meldrews move house, they discover he is their neighbour, living on the other side of the Meldrews from the Trenches. He remains continuously optimistic; even his being told to "piss off" by Victor is laughed off. However, despite this little run-in he later befriends Victor. A kind-natured individual, Mr Swainey cared for many years for his bedridden senile mother, whom the audience never actually see. He does though occasionally drop his guard, on one occasion displaying his apparent depression. Following his mother's death, he moved house near the end of the series, but only went as far as the other side of Victor's house, into the Trenches'/McVitie's old house claiming he'd always wanted to live in an "end house, without leaving the area".

=== Other characters ===

'''Ronnie and Mildred''' (Gordon Peters and Barbara Ashcroft) <U+2013> Ronnie and Mildred were a constantly cheerful couple who provided yet another annoyance to the Meldrews, who dreaded any upcoming visits to them. They are referenced a number of times in the series for giving the Meldrews bizarre and always unwanted presents, usually involving a garish photograph of themselves. In the final series, however it was clear that their cheerfulness was a fa<U+00E7>ade and, in a particularly dark scene, Mildred hung herself "during a game of [[Happy Families]]". The shot of Mildred's feet dangling outside the window is usually cut from pre-watershed screenings.

'''Cousin Wilfred''' (John Rutland) <U+2013> Mrs. Warboys' cousin, Wilfred, appeared twice in the series, and was considered to be a fairly boring middle-aged man. In the final series, the effects of a stroke rendered him mute, and forced him to "speak" with the aid of an electronic voice generator. His poor typing on the generator led to several misunderstandings, such as asking Victor for a "bra of soup" (as opposed to a "bar of soap").

'''Great Aunt Joyce and Uncle Dick''' - [[Unseen character]]s, they are often mentioned by Victor and Margaret, as an aging and grim couple and Victor and Margaret dread having anything to do with them. Great Aunt Joyce is mentioned as having a glass eye and has the habit of knitting bizarre items (such as six-fingered gloves) for Victor. Uncle Dick has a wooden arm; in the final [[Comic Relief]] (2001) episode, it transpires that a nurse had mistakenly placed a drip in the false arm for 18 hours after a trip to hospital after trying to remove a kidney stone with a wire coat hanger.

'''Mimsy Berkovitz''' - Another [[unseen character]], she is the local [[agony aunt]], whom many of the characters turn to for advice. In the episode "The Secret of the Seven Sorcerers", Patrick is heard talking to her on the radio, seeking her advice on how to cope when Victor and Margaret invite him and Pippa around to dinner.

'''Martin Trout''' (Peter Cook) - The main antagonist of "One Foot in the Algarve".

== Production ==

The production of the show was in a conventional sitcom format, with episodes taped live in front of a [[studio audience]], interposed with pre-filmed location material.<ref name="screenonline"/>

Most of the first five series of ''One Foot in the Grave'' were produced and directed by [[Susan Belbin]], the exceptions being "Love and Death," which was partly directed by veteran sitcom director [[Sydney Lotterby]], and "Starbound," for which [[Gareth Gwenlan]] (who in fact had originally commissioned the series in 1989) stepped in to direct some sequences after Belbin was taken ill. Belbin retired due to ill health afterwards,<ref name="w177">{{harvnb|Webber|2006|p=177}}</ref> and the final series was produced by Jonathan P. Llewellyn and directed by Christine Gernon. Wilson and Renwick felt that Gernon's experience of working with Belbin on earlier series of ''One Foot'' as a production secretary and assistant, as well as other shows, meant that her style was similar to Belbin's, aiding the transition between directors.<ref name="w177"/>

''One Foot'' used [[Bournemouth]] to film some exterior sequences because of its favourable climate, easy access to London, and economical benefits relative to filming in the capital. After the first series was filmed, the house{{mdash}}near [[Pokesdown]], Bournemouth{{Mdash}}which had been used for the Meldrews' house in location sequences, changed hands and the new owners demanded nearly treble the usage fees that the previous owners had asked for. Rather than agree to this, the production team decided to find a new house, and the first episode of the second series was rewritten to have the Meldrews' house destroyed in a fire. This also gave the opportunity for a new interior set to be designed, as Belbin had been unhappy with the original set designed for the series, which she felt was too restrictive to shoot in.<ref name="w53">{{harvnb|Webber|2006|p=53}}</ref>

Since series two, the exterior scenes of the Meldrew's home were filmed at Tresillian Way, Walkford, near New Milton in Hampshire.<ref name="w85">{{harvnb|Webber|2006|p=85}}</ref> These later series make extensive use of specific street and garden locations in most episodes, particularly for scenes involving the Meldrew's neighbours.<ref>[http://archive.bournemouthecho.co.uk/2005/7/6/54266.html Did Victor put one foot in your garden?] Bournemouth Echo, Wednesday 6 July 2005. Retrieved January 2009</ref> Most outside locations were filmed in and around Bournemouth and [[Christchurch, Dorset|Christchurch]]. These include Richmond Hill, Undercliff Drive and [[Boscombe Pier]], Bournemouth Town Hall, [[Bournemouth and Poole College|Lansdowne College]], [[Christchurch Hospital, Dorset|Christchurch Hospital]] and the former Royal Victoria Hospital ([[Boscombe]]). Later episodes, such as "Hearts of Darkness", were filmed entirely on location. Victor's death by a hit and run driver in the final episode was filmed at [[Shawford railway station]], Hampshire. Fans left floral tributes at the site.<ref>{{Cite news|first= |last= |title=Victor's fans say it with flowers |curly= |url=http://archive.thenorthernecho.co.uk/2000/11/23/186162.html |publisher=[[Northern Echo]] |location= |id= |date=23 November 2000 |accessdate=28 January 2009}}</ref><ref name="w183">{{harvnb|Webber|2006|p=183}}</ref>

The show was produced with an aspect ratio of [[4:3]] from 1990-1997. Three years later, the show returned to television for its final series, which was produced with an aspect ratio of [[16:9]]. All episodes are of Standard Definition [[576i]].

== Music ==

The ''One Foot in the Grave'' [[theme song]] was written, composed and sung by [[Eric Idle]]. A longer version was produced for the special "One Foot in the Algarve", released as a single with five remixes and a karaoke version in November 1994.<ref>http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0018E65H4/ref=dm_att_alb3</ref> Idle included a live version of the song on his album ''[[Eric Idle Sings Monty Python]]''.<ref>[http://www.cduniverse.com/search/xx/music/pid/1128289/a/Sings+Monty+Python+Live+In+Concert.htm Sings Monty Python: Live In Concert Soundtrack CD<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> It is preluded by a similar adaptation of "[[Bread of Heaven]]" to that used in the episode "The Beast in the Cage" by disgruntled car mechanics.<ref name="beast">"The Beast in the Cage", ''One Foot in the Grave'', Series 3, episode 4, wr. D. Renwick</ref><ref>It is reprised in the fourth series episode "Warm Champagne"</ref>
The music on the TV series is accompanied at the beginning and end of each episode by a [[Tortoise]].
The series also made extensive use of incidental music, composed by [[Ed Welch]], which often hinted at a particular genre to fit the mood of the scenes, frequently incorporating well-known pieces of music such as "[[God rest you merry, gentlemen]]" or ''Intermezzo'' from [[Jean Sibelius]]' ''[[Karelia Suite]]''. In the [[List of One Foot in the Grave episodes#Christmas Specials .281995 to 1997.29|Christmas special "Endgame"]] during Margaret's alleged death scene, a compilation of clips from past episodes are accompanied by the song "River Runs Deep" performed by J. J. Cale. The final episode ended with a montage of some of the mishaps Victor encountered, which were mentioned in the episode&nbsp;<U+2013> backed by "[[End of the Line (Traveling Wilburys song)|End of the Line]]" by the [[Traveling Wilburys|Travelling Wilburys]].

== Awards ==

The programme received a number of prestigious awards. In 1992, it won a [[British Academy Television Awards|BAFTA]] as Best Comedy (Programme or Series). During its ten-year run, the series was nominated a further six times. Richard Wilson also won Best Light Entertainment Performance in 1992 and 1994, and Annette Crosbie was nominated for the same award in 1994.

The series also won the Best Television Sitcom in 1992 from the [[Royal Television Society]] and the [[British Comedy Award]] for Best Sitcom in 1992, 1995 and 2001.<ref>[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0098882/awards List of Awards at IMDb], URL accessed 8 June 2006</ref>

In 2004, ''One Foot in the Grave'' came tenth in a BBC poll to find "[[Britain's Best Sitcom]]" with 31,410 votes.<ref>[http://www.bbc.co.uk/sitcom/winner.shtml Britain's Best Sitcom top ten], URL accessed 8 June 2006</ref> The programme also came 80th in the [[British Film Institute]]'s [[100 Greatest British Television Programmes]] <ref name="BFI TV100"/>

== Controversies ==

A number of complaints were made during the series' run for its depiction of animal deaths. For example, in the episode "The Valley of Fear", a dead cat is found in the Meldrews' freezer; in another, a [[tortoise]] is roasted in a brazier. However, this was later cited as a positive feature of the programme's daring scripts in ''Britain's Best Sitcom'' by its advocate [[Rowland Rivron]].<ref>[http://www.bbc.co.uk/sitcom/advocate_onefoot.shtml Rowland Rivron's case] at BBC Britain's Best Sitcom, URL accessed 8 June 2006</ref> The programme was censured, however, for a scene in the episode "Hearts of Darkness" in which an elderly resident is abused in an old people's home, and following complaints, the scene was slightly cut when the episode was repeated.<ref>[http://www.museum.tv/archives/etv/O/htmlO/onefootint/onefootint.htm One Foot in the Grave at the Museum of Broadcast] article by Pam Logan. Retrieved 8 June 2006</ref> Another controversial scene in the episode "Tales of Terror" saw the Meldrews visit Ronnie and Mildred on the understanding that Mildred had gone upstairs during a game of [[Happy Families]] and not returned; Ronnie then shows her feet hanging outside of the window, revealing that she has committed suicide. The [[Broadcasting Standards Commission]] received complaints about this scene.<ref name="connections">{{cite episode |title=One Foot in the Grave |series=[[Comedy Connections]] |credits=Series Producer Graham Mitchell; Director Julie Newing |network=BBC |airdate=2007-01-12}}</ref>

When the final episode, "[[Things Aren't Simple Any More]]" originally aired on 20 November 2000 at 21:00, it coincided with the broadcast of the [[Judith Keppel|first jackpot winner]] in the UK version of ''[[Who Wants to Be a Millionaire? (UK game show)|Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?]]'', which had been filmed the Sunday before the broadcast. [[ITV]] was accused of engineering this in order to damage the final episode's expected high ratings, but was later cleared by the [[Independent Television Commission]].<ref>{{Cite news|title=Millionaire? cleared of ratings 'fix' |work=BBC News |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/1118212.stm | date=15 January 2001 |accessdate=2007-01-28}}</ref>

== Cultural impact ==
{{Wikiquote|One Foot In The Grave}}

Despite gaining initially low audience ratings, by the third series, ''One Foot in the Grave'' was making the Top 20 ratings, with some episodes seen by more than 16 million viewers. In particular, the Christmas 1993 edition topped 20 million viewers.

Due to the series' popularity, people who constantly complain and are irritated by minor things are often compared to Victor Meldrew by the British [[News media|media]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/pages/live/articles/news/news.html?in_article_id=508401&in_page_id=1770 |title='Real-life Victor Meldrew' attacked neighbour with rake over honeysuckle row|publisher=''[[The Daily Mail]]''|date=2008-01-15|accessdate=2008-05-27}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/opinion/commentators/the-real-victor-meldrew-would-have-had-no-time-for-this-new-social-group-641160.html |title=The real Victor Meldrew would have had no time for this new social group|publisher=''[[The Independent]]''|date=2002-08-28|accessdate=2008-05-27 | location=London | first=David | last=Aaronovitch}}</ref> Renwick disputes this usage however, claiming that Victor's reactions are entirely in proportion to the things that happen to him.<ref>{{cite video|people=[[David Renwick]] (interviewed) |url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0395381/ |title=Britain's Best Sitcom? |publisher=BBC Television |date=2004-01-10|accessdate=2008-05-27}}</ref>

Renwick integrated some of the plots and dialogue from the series into a novel, which was first published by BBC Books in 1992. Renwick also adapted four episodes for [[BBC Radio 2]], which first aired between 21 January 1995 and 11 February 1995.<ref name="bbc"/> The episodes are "Alive and Buried", "In Luton Airport, No One Can Hear You Scream", "Timeless Time" and "The Beast in the Cage". They are regularly repeated on the digital speech station [[BBC Radio 4 Extra]] and are available on audio CD.

A loose American [[remake]] of the show starred [[Bill Cosby]] and was simply titled ''[[Cosby]]''; it ran from [[1996 in television|1996]] to [[2000 in television|2000]]. David Renwick was listed as a consultant on the series. In 2001, [[Sweden|Swedish]] commercial television channel TV4 produced a version of the show, entitled "En fot i graven", starring [[G<U+00F6>sta Ekman]] as Victor Meldrew and [[Lena S<U+00F6>derblom]] as his wife. A total of 12 episodes were broadcast.<ref>[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0273344/ En fot i graven] at the [[Internet Movie Database]], URL accessed 22 May 2010</ref>

Wilson dislikes saying his character's catchphrase ("I don't believe it!") and only performs the line for charity events for a small fee.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/drama/faces/richard_wilson.shtml |title=BBC Drama Faces: Richard Wilson |accessdate=2008-05-27|publisher=[[BBC|bbc.co.uk]]}}</ref> This became a joke in the actor's guest appearance as himself in the ''[[Father Ted]]'' episode "[[The Mainland (Father Ted)|The Mainland]]", where [[Father Ted Crilly|Ted]] and [[Father Dougal McGuire|Dougal]] annoy him by constantly repeating his catchphrase. The situation was conceived when ''Father Ted'' writers [[Graham Linehan]] and [[Arthur Mathews (writer)|Arthur Mathews]] sat behind Wilson at a performance of ''[[Le Cirque du Soleil]]'' at the [[Royal Albert Hall]]. They considered how "tasteless and wrong" it would be to lean forward to him every time that an acrobat did a stunt and yell the catchphrase, and then they realised that that's exactly what their fictional priests would do.<ref>{{Cite book|authors=[[Graham Linehan]] and [[Arthur Mathews (writer)|Arthur Mathews]] |title=Father Ted: The Complete Scripts |isbn=0-7522-7235-7 |publisher=Boxtree |location=London |page=298}}</ref> This was also played upon when Wilson made a guest appearance on the comedy TV quiz show [[Shooting Stars]], in which Vic Reeves and Bob Mortimer purposefully misquoted his catchphrase by referring to him as "Richard 'I don't believe you' Wilson".
