'''Harmon Clayton Killebrew''' ({{pron-en|<U+02C8>k<U+026A>l<U+0268>bru<U+02D0>}}; born June 29, 1936) is a former [[Major League Baseball]] player. In a 22-year major league career, he was second only to [[Babe Ruth]] in [[American League]] [[home run]]s and retired as the career leader in home runs by a [[right-handed]] batter (the record has since been broken).<ref name="RetiredNumbers">{{cite web|url=http://minnesota.twins.mlb.com/min/history/killebrew.jsp|title=Minnesota Twins Retired Numbers - 3: Harmon Killebrew|publisher=[[MLB.com]]|accessdate=2008-07-23}}</ref><ref name="OSBio">{{cite web|url=http://web.archive.org/web/20080117105625/http://www.harmonkillebrew.com/biography.htm|title=The Official Site of Harmon Killebrew: Biography|publisher=CMG Worldwide|accessdate=2008-06-24}}</ref> He is a member of the [[National Baseball Hall of Fame]], inducted in 1984.

Killebrew was a stocky {{convert|5|ft|11|in|m|abbr=on}}, 210 pounds (95.3 kg) hitter with a short, compact swing that generated tremendous power. He became one of the [[American League]]'s most feared power hitters of the 1960s, belting 40 homers in a season eight times. In {{by|1965}}, he helped the Twins reach the [[World Series]], where they lost to the [[Los Angeles Dodgers]]. He had his finest season in {{by|1969}}, hitting 49 home runs, driving in 140 runs, and winning the [[MLB Most Valuable Player award|MVP Award]]. Killebrew led the league in home runs six times, in RBIs three times, and was named to eleven All Star teams. As a result, he was nicknamed "Killer" and was also called "Hammerin' Harmon". Killebrew never hit 50 home runs in a single season, but he did hit 49 homers in a season twice (1964, 1969). He hit the most home runs for any player in the 1960s.<ref name="BBResearch">{{cite journal|last=Nelson|first=Scott|date=January 1, 2000|accessdate=2008-07-13|journal=The Baseball Research Journal|url=http://www.allbusiness.com/health-care-social-assistance/social-assistance-individual/707373-1.html|title=Individual Records by Decades}}</ref>

With exceptional upper-body strength, Killebrew was known not just for home run frequency but also home runs of great distance, known as "tape measure homers". He hit the longest measured home runs at the ballparks in [[Metropolitan Stadium|Minnesota]] and [[Memorial Stadium (Baltimore)|Baltimore]], and was the first of just four batters who hit a baseball over the left field roof at [[Tiger Stadium (Detroit)|Detroit]].

Despite his "Killer" nickname and his powerful style of play, Killebrew was in fact a quiet, kind man who was not much given to the partying lifestyle enjoyed by his peers. Asked once what he liked to do for fun, Killebrew replied, "Well, I like to wash dishes, I guess."<ref name="SIHeilman1">{{cite journal|last=Heilman|first=Barbara|date=April 8, 1963|accessdate=2008-07-07|journal=[[Sports Illustrated]]|url=http://vault.sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1074683/1/index.htm|title=Out Of The Park On A Half Swing}}</ref> Killebrew was baptized a member of the [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints|Church of Jesus Christ of Latter day Saints]], and his wife was a lifelong member.

==Early life and school==
Harmon Killebrew was born in [[Payette, Idaho|Payette]], [[Idaho]] to Harmon Clayton, Sr. and Katherine Pearl (May) Killebrew.  He was the youngest of four children. His father, a [[Painting|painter]] and [[Sheriffs in the United States|sheriff]], was a member of an undefeated [[Millikin College]] [[American football|football]] team. He was later named an [[All-America]]n under eventual [[Pro Football Hall of Fame]] coach [[Greasy Neale]].<ref name="Porter807">[[#Porter|Porter]], p. 807.</ref><ref name="Thielman132">[[#Thielman|Thielman]], p. 132.</ref> According to family legend, Harmon Killebrew's grandfather was the strongest man in the [[Union Army]], winning every available [[Wrestling weight classes|heavyweight wrestling]] championship.<ref name="Thielman132" /> Clayton encouraged Harmon and his brothers to stay active in various sports before his sudden death in 1953 at age 59.<ref name="Thielman132" />

As a child, Harmon played baseball at [[Walter Johnson]] Memorial Field, named after the Hall of Fame pitcher who spent part of his childhood in Idaho.<ref name="Thielman131">[[#Thielman|Thielman]], p. 131.</ref>  Killebrew earned 12 [[Letterman|letters]] in various sports and was named an All-American [[quarterback]] at [[Payette High School]].  His uniform number was later retired by the school.<ref name="Porter807" /><ref name="Thielman134">[[#Thielman|Thielman]], p. 134.</ref> He was offered an [[athletic scholarship]] by the [[Oregon Ducks|University of Oregon]], but opted to attend the [[College of Idaho]] instead.<ref name="Porter8078">[[#Porter|Porter]], pp. 807-808.</ref>

In the early 1950s, [[List of United States Senators from Idaho|Idaho Senator]] [[Herman Welker]] told Washington Senators owner [[Clark Griffith]] about Harmon Killebrew, who was batting .847 for a [[semi-professional]] baseball team at the time.<ref name="Thielman131" /><ref name="Porter808">[[#Porter|Porter]], p. 808.</ref>  Griffith told his [[Farm team|farm]] director [[Ossie Bluege]] about the tip and Bluege flew to Idaho to watch Killebrew play.<ref name="Thielman133">[[#Thielman|Thielman]], p. 133.</ref>  The [[Boston Red Sox]] also expressed interest but Bluege succeeded in signing him to a $50,000 (${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|50000|1954|r=0}}}} in current dollar terms) contract on June 19, 1954.<ref name="Thielman134"/><ref name="Porter808" /><ref>{{cite news|publisher=[[The New York Times]]|title=Senators Pay $50,000 To First Bonus Player|date=June 20, 1954|work=Sports|page=S3}}</ref>

==Major league career==
===Washington===
Killebrew's contract put him under Major League Baseball's [[Bonus Rule]] which required that he spend two full seasons on the major league roster.<ref name="Porter808"/> He made his debut four days after signing with the Senators and at age 17 was the youngest player in the major leagues at the time.<ref name=BBRef>{{cite web|url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/k/killeha01.shtml|title=Harmon Killebrew Statistics|publisher=[[Baseball-Reference]].com|accessdate=2008-06-28}}</ref> On August 23, 1954, Killebrew made his first start in the second game of a [[Doubleheader (baseball)|doubleheader]] against the [[Philadelphia Athletics]]. He hit two [[single (baseball)|singles]] and a [[double (baseball)|double]] as the Senators won the game, 10&ndash;3.<ref>{{cite news|first=Shirley|last=Povich|title=Kid Killebrew Shines at Bat in Bow as Nat|publisher=[[The Sporting News]]|date=September 1, 1954|page=6}}</ref> In 1954 and 1955 combined, Killebrew struck out 34 times in only 93 at bats, contributing to a .215 [[batting average]], with four home runs.<ref name="Porter808"/>  Killebrew also had defensive difficulties at [[Third baseman|third base]] where he played behind veteran [[Eddie Yost]].<ref name="Porter808"/><ref name=BBRef/>  

In 1956, Killebrew's bonus period expired and he was sent to [[Charlotte Hornets (baseball)|Charlotte]] of the [[South Atlantic League]].<ref name="RetiredNumbers" />  He returned to the majors in early May.  On May 29, he was batting .000 for Washington but was forced into action when regular [[second baseman]] [[Pete Runnels]] was injured early in the game.<ref name="Retro1956HK">{{cite web|url=http://www.retrosheet.org/boxesetc/1956/Ikillh1020031956.htm|title=The 1956 WAS A Regular Season Batting Log for Harmon Killebrew|publisher=[[Retrosheet]]|accessdate=2008-06-28}}</ref>  Killebrew hit two long home runs in the game including only the second ball ever hit over a wire barrier in [[Memorial Stadium (Baltimore)|Memorial Stadium]]'s center field.<ref name="Thielman136">[[#Thielman|Thielman]], p. 136.</ref>  Through June 16, he had a .115 average and was soon sent back to Charlotte where he finished with a .325 batting average and 15 home runs in 70 games.<ref name="RetiredNumbers" /><ref name="Retro1956HK" /><ref name="Cube">{{cite web|url=http://www.thebaseballcube.com/players/K/Harmon-Killebrew.shtml|title=Harmon Killebrew|publisher=The Baseball Cube|accessdate=2008-06-28}}</ref>  Killebrew spent most of 1957 and 1958 with the [[Southern Association]]'s [[Chattanooga Lookouts]].  In 1957, he hit a league-high 29 home runs with 101 RBIs and was named to the All-Star Game despite a shoulder injury and a home stadium where hitting home runs to left field was difficult.<ref name="RetiredNumbers" /><ref name="Cube" /><ref name="Thielman137">[[#Thielman|Thielman]], p. 137.</ref>  While Killebrew was in Chattanooga, he became the only player to hit a home run over the center field wall at Engel Stadium, {{convert|471|ft|m}} from home plate.<ref name="Murrell">{{cite web|url=http://www.idahopress.com/special/?sr=4&sra=4537|title=Harmon Killebrew: Baseball's killer|last=Murrell|first=I.

===Breakout season===
[[Calvin Griffith]], who had taken over the Senators after his uncle Clark died in 1955, decided Killebrew was ready to become the Senators' regular third baseman and traded the 32-year-old Eddie Yost to the [[Detroit Tigers]] on December 6, 1958.<ref name="Porter808"/><ref name="BBRefYost">{{cite web|url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/y/yosted01.shtml|title=Eddie Yost Statistics|publisher=[[Baseball-Reference]].com|accessdate=2008-06-28}}</ref>  Killebrew had a slow April in 1959, his first season as a regular in the majors, but picked up the pace in May.<ref name="Retro1959HK">{{cite web|url=http://www.retrosheet.org/boxesetc/1959/Ikillh1020061959.htm|title=The 1959 WAS A Regular Season Batting Log for Harmon Killebrew|publisher=[[Retrosheet]]|accessdate=2008-06-28}}</ref> From May 1 to May 17, he had five multi-home run games and his first five-RBI game on May 12.<ref name="Porter808"/><ref name="Retro1959HK"/>  With 28 home runs by mid-season, he started the [[1959 Major League Baseball All-Star Game (first game)|first 1959 All-Star Game]] and was a reserve in [[1959 Major League Baseball All-Star Game (second game)|the second]].  Killebrew garnered so much attention in Washington that he was visited by [[President of the United States]] [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] who frequently attended games.<ref name="Allen76">[[#Allen|Allen]], p. 76.</ref>  The [[Cincinnati Reds]] offered Griffith $500,000 for Killebrew but were turned down.<ref name="Allen76" />  Killebrew finished the season with 42 home runs to tie for the [[List of Major League Baseball home run champions|American League lead]] as well the Washington single-season record set by his teammate [[Roy Sievers]] two years earlier.<ref name="Porter808"/><ref name="DigestClubRecords">{{cite journal|month=June|year=2003|accessdate=2008-07-20|journal=[[Baseball Digest]]|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0FCI/is_6_62/ai_100961691|title=Club home run leaders - Season}}</ref>  Despite his breakout season, he was ineligible for the [[Major League Baseball Rookie of the Year Award|Rookie of the Year Award]] because of his previous sparse experience.  His teammate [[Bob Allison]] won the award instead.<ref name="Thielman143">[[#Thielman|Thielman]], p. 143.</ref> In 1960, Killebrew missed action in the first half but hit 27 of his 31 home runs in the second half.<ref name="RetiredNumbers"/>

Killebrew's arrival did little to improve the Senators' record, as they finished in the [[first division (baseball)|second division]] every year he played in Washington, including four years in last place.<ref name="BBRefYost">{{cite web|url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/teams/MIN/|title=Minnesota Twins History & Encyclopedia|publisher=[[Baseball-Reference]].com|accessdate=2008-06-29}}</ref>  The Senators moved to the Twin Cities and became the [[Minnesota Twins]] in 1961.

===Minnesota===
For the franchise's first year in Minnesota, Killebrew was named [[Major League Baseball Team Captains|team captain]] by [[manager (baseball)|manager]] [[Cookie Lavagetto]].<ref name="Thielman16">[[#Thielman|Thielman]], p. 16.</ref>  He responded by hitting 46 home runs, breaking the franchise record he had shared with Roy Sievers.<ref name="DigestClubRecords" />  He also accumulated 122 RBIs, batted a career-best .288, slugged over .600 for the only time in his career and, on June 12, 1961, had the only five-hit game of his career.<ref name="BBRef" /><ref name="RetroHKTop">{{cite web|url=http://www.retrosheet.org/boxesetc/K/PX_killh102.htm|title=Top Performances for Harmon Killebrew|publisher=[[Retrosheet]]|accessdate=2008-07-20}}</ref><ref name="RetroHK5H">{{cite web|url=http://www.retrosheet.org/boxesetc/1961/B06120BOS1961.htm|title=Boston Red Sox 10, Minnesota Twins 8|publisher=[[Retrosheet]]|accessdate=2008-07-20}}</ref>  The Twins lost that game and, overall, finished 20 games under .500.  Killebrew was named to both All-Star games and hit a [[pinch hitter|pinch hit]] home run in the first.  In addition to home runs, he also led the Twins in runs, RBIs, total bases and walks, and tied for the team lead in triples.<ref name="RetiredNumbers" />

Killebrew had decent speed until he suffered pulled [[hamstring]] injuries in 1960 and 1961, pulled [[Quadriceps femoris muscle|quadriceps]] in 1962, and a knee injury prior to [[spring training]] of 1963 that cost him the entire spring and 20 regular season games.<ref name="Thielman146">[[#Thielman|Thielman]], p. 146.</ref>  He played left field in 1962 and 1963. Knee surgery before the 1964 season gave him one more season in the outfield.  Killebrew played outfield despite a below average throwing arm.<ref name="BBRef" /><ref name="Thielman146" />  After the 1964 season, he moved to the infield for the remainder of his career.<ref name="Thielman145">[[#Thielman|Thielman]], p. 145.</ref>

Killebrew's offense finally reflected in the standings in 1962.  He hit 48 home runs and 126 RBIs, both career highs at the time, and both leading the American League.<ref name="BBRef" />  The 48 home runs broke Killebrew's own franchise record set the year before.<ref name="DigestClubRecords" />  No one else in the A.L. hit as many as 40.<ref name="BBRef1962leaders">{{cite web|url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/leagues/AL_1962_t.shtml|title=1962 American League Expanded Leaderboards|publisher=[[Baseball-Reference]].com|accessdate=2008-07-15}}</ref>  The Twins' record improved from 70-90 in 1961 to 91-71, five games behind the eventual [[1962 World Series|World Champion]] [[New York Yankees]].  Killebrew's average dropped from .288 in 1961 to .243 and he struck out a career-worst 142 times.<ref name="BBRef" />  No one else struck out more than 118 times.<ref name="BBRef1962leaders" />  After hitting under .200 in both April and June, Killebrew missed the 1962 All-Star Game, the last season he was not an All-Star before 1972.<ref name="Retro1962HKSplit">{{cite web|url=http://www.retrosheet.org/boxesetc/1962/Jkillh1020091962.htm|title=The 1962 MIN A Batting Splits for Harmon Killebrew|publisher=[[Retrosheet]]|accessdate=2008-07-15}}</ref>  On July 18, Killebrew and [[Bob Allison]] became the first teammates since 1890 to hit a [[grand slam (baseball)|grand slam]] in the same inning as the Twins scored 11 runs in the first.<ref name="RetiredNumbers" /><ref name="RetroHK2GS">{{cite web|url=http://www.retrosheet.org/boxesetc/1962/B07180MIN1962.htm|title=Minnesota Twins 14, Cleveland Indians 3|publisher=[[Retrosheet]]|accessdate=2008-07-26}}</ref><ref name="BAlmTeamGS">{{cite web|url=http://www.baseball-almanac.com/rb_grsl2.shtml|title=Team Grand Slam Records|publisher=Baseball Almanac|accessdate=2008-07-26}}</ref>  Killebrew again led the Twins in total bases, RBIs and walks.<ref name="RetiredNumbers"/>

In 1965, the Twins won the [[American League pennant winners 1901<U+2013>68|American League pennant]].  On July 11, the day before the All-Star break, the defending American League champion [[New York Yankees]] took a one-run lead in the top of the 9th inning but Killebrew hit a two-run home run in the bottom of the 9th to win.  It was considered the most dramatic home run in Twins history until 1991.<ref name="Thielman128130">[[#Thielman|Thielman]], pp. 128-130.</ref>  At the time, the Yankees had won all but two league pennants since 1949 but they would not win another until 1976.  Two days later, Killebrew started the All-Star Game in front of his Twins fans in Minnesota and hit a game-tying two-run home run erasing what had been a 5-0 National League lead.<ref name="Allen79">[[#Allen|Allen]], p. 79.</ref>  The National League wound up winning the game anyway.<ref name="Retro1965AS">{{cite web|url=http://www.retrosheet.org/boxesetc/1965/B07130ALS1965.htm|title=National League 6, American League 5|publisher=[[Retrosheet]]|accessdate=2008-07-05}}</ref>  Killebrew drove in the tying or winning run seven times in 1965 before August 2.<ref name="Thielman102">[[#Thielman|Thielman]], p. 102.</ref>  On that date, Twins third baseman [[Rich Rollins]] made a poor throw to Killebrew at first.

Killebrew hit 44 home runs with 113 RBIs and the Twins went 91-71 in 1967, but it was the year of the [[Boston Red Sox]].

He led the American League in home runs, RBIs, on-base percentage, walks, and intentional walks and knocked in the winning run 20 times while playing in all 162 games.<ref name="BBRef" /><ref name="Allen80">[[#Allen|Allen]], p. 80.</ref>  His home run, RBI, and walk totals from 1969 are all still team records.<ref name="RetiredNumbers" />  On July 5, Killebrew set a career-high with six RBIs against the [[Oakland Athletics]].<ref name="RetroHKTop" /><ref name="RetroHK6RBI">{{cite web|url=http://www.retrosheet.org/boxesetc/1969/B07050MIN1969.htm|title=Minnesota Twins 13, Oakland 1|publisher=[[Retrosheet]]|accessdate=2008-07-21}}</ref>  That personal best lasted barely two months until September 7 when he hit a three-run home run and a [[grand slam (baseball)|grand slam]] for seven RBIs, all in the first two innings, again defeating the Athletics.<ref name="RetroHKTop" /><ref name="RetroHK7RBI">{{cite web|url=http://www.retrosheet.org/boxesetc/1969/B09070OAK1969.htm|title=Minnesota Twins 16, Oakland Athletics 4|publisher=[[Retrosheet]]|accessdate=2008-07-21}}</ref>  Killebrew led the best offense in the league and rookie manager [[Billy Martin]]'s Twins won the new [[American League West]] division.  In the [[1969 American League Championship Series]], however, the [[Baltimore Orioles]] used the league's best pitching staff to shut down Minnesota and swept the series.<ref name="Armour192" />  Baltimore avoided Killebrew by walking him six times in the three games, as many as the rest of the Twins combined.<ref name="BBRef1969ALCS">{{cite web|url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/postseason/1969_ALCS.shtml|title=1969 AL Championship Series - BAL vs. MIN|publisher=[[Baseball-Reference]].com|accessdate=2008-07-04}}</ref>

In 1969, the official [[Major League Baseball logo|logo]] of [[Major League Baseball]] was introduced. It features a silhouette of a broad-shouldered batter holding a bat up, poised to swing at the pitched ball coming towards him. Being a silhouette, it is not possible to determine if the batter is right or left-handed. Nonetheless, a baseball "urban legend" holds that the figure is Killebrew. However, MLB.com states the following: "The MLB logo: No one player has ever been identified as the model of the 1969 Major League Baseball batter logo".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mlb.mlb.com/NASApp/mlb/mlb/official_info/about_mlb/rules_regulations.jsp|title=MLB Miscellany: Rules, regulations and statistics|publisher=[[MLB.com]]|accessdate=2008-06-26}}</ref>

Killebrew was one of only four Minnesota Twins from the 1965 pennant-winning club still with the team in 1970 but they again won their division.<ref name="Armour193">[[#Armour|Armour]], p. 193.</ref>  Killebrew hit another 41 home runs with 113 RBIs and was third in MVP voting behind his teammate [[Tony Oliva]] and the award winner, Baltimore's [[Boog Powell]].<ref name="BBRef1970Awards">{{cite web|url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/awards/awards_1970.shtml#ALmvp|title=Baseball Awards Voting for 1970|publisher=[[Baseball-Reference]].com|accessdate=2008-07-04}}</ref>  As in 1969, they faced Powell and the Orioles in the [[1970 American League Championship Series]] but again, they were swept.  Killebrew and the Twins' offense fared better than in 1969 but they allowed 27 runs and never led a game after the 2nd inning of Game 1.<ref name="BBRef1970ALCS">{{cite web|url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/postseason/1970_ALCS.shtml|title=1970 AL Championship Series - BAL vs. MIN|publisher=[[Baseball-Reference]].com|accessdate=2008-07-04}}</ref>

===Decline===
The 1970 season marked the last 40+ home run season for Killebrew and also his last postseason appearance.  In his last four years with the Twins, they never finished higher than third in the American League West.  In 1971, the 35-year-old Killebrew led the American League with 119 RBIs and hit a two-run home run off [[Ferguson Jenkins]] to provide the margin of victory in the All-Star Game.<ref name="BBRef" /><ref name="Retro1971AS">{{cite web|url=http://www.retrosheet.org/boxesetc/1971/B07130ALS1971.htm|title=American League 6, National League 4|publisher=[[Retrosheet]]|accessdate=2008-07-06}}</ref>  But, outside of the injury-shortened 1968, his home run percentage and slugging percentage were his lowest since he started playing regularly, and the All-Star Game was his last.<ref name="BBRef" />  Killebrew hit home run number 498 on June 22, 1971 but a sprained right toe made his run to the milestone number 500 a slow one.  He hit number 499 more than a month after 498 and finally hit number 500 off a [[Mike Cuellar]] slow [[curveball]] on August 10, 1971 in a game at [[Metropolitan Stadium|The Met]].<ref name="Allen80" /><ref name="Retro1971HK">{{cite web|url=http://www.retrosheet.org/boxesetc/1971/Ikillh1020181971.htm|title=The 1971 MIN A Regular Season Batting Log for Harmon Killebrew|publisher=[[Retrosheet]]|accessdate=2008-07-06}}</ref><ref name="Retro1971500">{{cite web|url=http://www.retrosheet.org/boxesetc/1971/B08100MIN1971.htm|title=Baltimore Orioles 4, Minnesota Twins 3|publisher=[[Retrosheet]]|accessdate=2008-07-06}}</ref>  He wasted no time in hitting number 501 which he hit off a Cuellar [[fastball]] later in the same game.<ref name="Allen80" /><ref name="Retro1971500" />

In 1972, his RBI total dropped to 74 and his slugging and batting average dropped even lower than in 1971.  In 1973 and 1974, Killebrew combined for only 18 home runs and 86 RBIs while his playing time was reduced by injury.<ref name="BBRef" /><ref name="Allen81">[[#Allen|Allen]], p. 81.</ref>  At age 38, he was given the option of staying with the Twins as a coach and batting instructor, managing the AAA [[Tacoma Twins]], or being released.  He chose to be released and, after a one-year stint with the [[Kansas City Royals]] in [[1975 in baseball|1975]], he chose to retire.<ref name="Allen81" />  Killebrew hit 573 home runs in his career (tenth best all time, most by an [[American League]] right-hander, and second in the AL only to [[Babe Ruth]], as of 2008) and drove in 1,584 runs.  He was elected to the [[Baseball Hall of Fame]] in 1984, the first Minnesota Twin to be so honored.

Killebrew was first eligible for the Hall of Fame in [[Baseball Hall of Fame balloting, 1981|1981]]. He received 239 votes, or 59.6% of the vote in his first year of eligibility.<ref name=bbhofvote>{{cite web|url=http://web.baseballhalloffame.org/playerVoting.do?playerId=117051|title=Hall of Fame Votes By Player|publisher=National Baseball Hall of Fame|accessdate=2008-07-05}}</ref> In [[Baseball Hall of Fame balloting, 1982|1982]], Killebrew's second year of eligibility, he received 59.3% of the vote, taking a backseat to [[Hank Aaron]] and [[Frank Robinson]], who made it in in their first year of eligibility.<ref name=bbhofvote/> After receiving 71.9% of the vote in [[Baseball Hall of Fame balloting, 1983|1983]], Killebrew said that not getting in this year was more difficult to accept than the previous two times, and asked "Why do the writers feel there only has to be a certain number inducted each time?"<ref>{{cite news|first=Patrick|last=Reusse|title=Killebrew Faces More Frustration|publisher=The Sporting News|date=1983-01-31|page=43}}</ref> In [[Baseball Hall of Fame balloting, 1984|1984]], Killebrew received 83.1% of the vote and made it in the Hall in his fourth year of eligibility, along with [[Luis Aparicio]] and [[Don Drysdale]].<ref name=bbhofvote/> In 1999, he was ranked 69th on [[The Sporting News list of Baseball's Greatest Players|The Sporting News list of the 100 Greatest Baseball Players]],<ref>{{cite journal|year= 1999|month= April|title= Baseball's 100 Greatest Players|journal= [[Sporting News]]|volume= |issue= |pages= 20|url= |accessdate=2008-07-03}}</ref> and was nominated as a finalist for the [[Major League Baseball]] All-Century Team.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://static.espn.go.com/mlb/news/1999/1023/129008.html|title= All-Century Team final voting|accessdate=2009-03-05 |author= [[Associated Press]]|publisher= [[ESPN.com]]|date= 1999-10-23}}</ref>

The street along the south side of the [[Mall of America]], the former site of the [[Metropolitan Stadium]] ("The Met"), has been named "Killebrew Drive" in honor of Harmon Killebrew. In 1974, his uniform number 3 was the first to be retired by the Twins, and is only one of five Twins to have their numbers retired (in addition to the MLB-wide retirement of [[Jackie Robinson]]'s number 42).<ref name="RetiredNumbers" /> Banners hanging above the Metrodome's outfield upper deck, resembling baseball cards, show the retired numbers: Killebrew (3), [[Rod Carew]] (29), [[Tony Oliva]] (6), [[Kent Hrbek]] (14) and [[Kirby Puckett]] (34). Killebrew easily holds the all-time home run record among players born in the state of [[Idaho]] with 573; [[Vance Law]] is second with 71.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/bio/ID_born.shtml|title=Players by birthplace: Idaho Baseball Stats and Info|work=[[Baseball-Reference.com]]|publisher=Sports Reference, LLC|accessdate=2009-08-05}}</ref> [[Reggie Jackson]] once said, "If Harmon Killebrew isn't the league's best player, I've never seen one.  He's one of the greatest of all time."<ref name="Allen80" />

Following his retirement, Killebrew was a television broadcaster for the Twins from 1976 to 1978, the [[Oakland Athletics]] from 1979 to 1982, the [[California Angels]] in 1983 and back with Minnesota from 1984 to 1988.<ref name="OSBio" /><ref name="Markoe515">[[#Markoe|Markoe]], p. 515.</ref>  While with Oakland, he also served as a major- and minor-league hitting instructor.<ref name="OSBio" />  In the late 1980s, Killebrew started running into financial problems.  In July 1988, a year after he and his wife divorced, his house went into [[foreclosure]] and, in 1989, the ''[[Minneapolis Star Tribune]]'' reported that he had fallen $700,000 into debt.<ref name="Allen81" /><ref name="Kalb350">[[#Kalb|Kalb]], p. 350.</ref>  Soon after, Killebrew's health failed.  In May 1990, he was rushed to the hospital with a [[collapsed lung]] and damaged [[esophagus]].<ref name="Kalb351">[[#Kalb|Kalb]], p. 351.</ref>  Together with a subsequent [[abscess]] and [[staph infection]], Killebrew endured three surgeries and nearly died.  He used a wheelchair for some time post-surgery.  By December 1990, his health was improved and he was remarried.<ref name="Allen81" /><ref name="Kalb351" />

He was involved in a [[Boise, Idaho]] insurance and securities business.<ref name="Markoe515" /> Killebrew currently resides in [[Scottsdale, Arizona]], where he chairs the Harmon Killebrew Foundation.<ref name="Markoe515" /><ref name="Foundation">{{cite web|url=http://www.harmonkillebrewfoundation.org|title=Harmon Killebrew Foundation|accessdate=2008-08-22}}</ref> Killebrew founded the [[Danny Thompson (baseball)|Danny Thompson]] Memorial Golf Tournament in 1977 with former [[Idaho]] [[United States Congress|congressman]] [[Ralph R.

==Personal life==
Killebrew had five children with his wife Elaine before they divorced after 34 years in the 1980s.<ref name="Kalb350" />  In the early 1990s, he married Nita.<ref name="Kalb351" />  Their family consists of 9 children, 23 grand children and 2 great grandchildren.  They currently live in [[Scottsdale, Arizona]] where they do charitable work through Harmon's foundation.<ref name="OSBio" />

==Tape measure home runs==
[[Image:MOA Killebrew chair1.JPG|thumb|right|190px|The red chair overlooking the flume ride at the MOA amusement park]]
Killebrew's batting strength was demonstrated by several "tape measure" home runs that he hit in the prime of his career.

On August 3, 1962, he was the first batter ever to hit a baseball over the left field roof at [[Tiger Stadium (Detroit)|Tiger Stadium]], a seldom-reached target as contrasted with the old ballpark's cozy right field area. Only three others would accomplish this feat during the next 37 seasons before the stadium was closed.<ref name="Pahigian">[[#Pahigian|Pahigian]], p. 253.</ref>

On May 24, 1964, Harmon hit the longest measured homer at [[Memorial Stadium (Baltimore)|Baltimore Memorial Stadium]], {{convert|471|ft|m}} to deep left center. The ball landed in the far reaches of the bleachers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/wire?section=mlb&id=3409131|title=Baseball Today|publisher=MLB.com|accessdate=2008-08-22}}</ref> The only player to hit one completely out of the Orioles' stadium was [[Frank Robinson]] in 1966, which was reported as about 451, or about {{convert|20|ft|m}} less than Killebrew's hit.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.baseballlibrary.com/baseballlibrary/chronology/1966MAY.stm|title=May 1966 Chronology|publisher=Baseball Library|accessdate=2008-08-22}}</ref>

On June 3, 1967, Killebrew hit a {{convert|520|ft|m|adj=on}} home run, the longest measured home run ever hit at the Twins' [[Metropolitan Stadium]] and the longest in Twins history.<ref name="Rushin1956" /><ref name="Leboutillier28">[[#Leboutillier|Leboutillier]], p. 28.</ref> That event is commemorated at the [[Mall of America]], which includes a plaque marking home plate, and one red-painted seat from the Met which was placed at the location and elevation of the landing spot of the home run.<ref name="Rushin1956" />
