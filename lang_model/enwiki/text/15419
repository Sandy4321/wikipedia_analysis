The '''National Autonomous University of Mexico''' ({{lang-es|Universidad Nacional Aut<U+00F3>noma de M<U+00E9>xico}}) ('''UNAM''') is a [[public university]] based primarily in [[Mexico City]] and is generally considered to have the largest enrollment among universities in the Americas.<ref name="uno" />.

The UNAM generates a number of different publications in diverse areas, such as mathematics, physics and history. It is also the only university in Mexico with [[Nobel Prize]] laureates among its alumni: [[Alfonso Garc<U+00ED>a Robles]] ([[Nobel Peace Prize|Peace]]), [[Octavio Paz]] ([[Nobel Prize for Literature|Literature]]), and [[Mario Molina]] ([[Nobel Prize in Chemistry|Chemistry]]).

Besides being one of the most recognized universities in Latin America, it is one of the largest and the most artistically detailed. Its main campus is a [[World Heritage]] site that was designed by some of Mexico's best-known architects of the [[20th century]]. Murals in the main campus were painted by some of the most recognized artists in Mexican history, such as [[Diego Rivera]] and [[Siqueiros|David Alfaro Siqueiros]].

==History==
[[Image:Justo Sierra.jpg|left|thumb|200px|[[Justo Sierra]], founder.]]
The university was founded on 22 September 1910 by [[Justo Sierra]],<ref name="foundationDate" /><ref name="discursoJustoSierra" /><ref name="sorbonne"/><ref name="garciadiego"/> then Minister of Education in the [[Porfirio D<U+00ED>az]] regime, who sought to create a very different institution from its 19th century precursor, the [[Royal and Pontifical University of Mexico]], which had been founded on 21 September 1551 by a royal decree signed by [[Crown Prince]] [[Philip II of Spain|Phillip]] on behalf of [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles I of Spain]]<ref name="royal-decree">{{cite book|last=M<U+00E9>ndez Arceo|first=Sergio|title=La Real y Pontificia Universidad de M<U+00E9>xico: antecedentes, tramitaci<U+00F3>n y despacho de las reales c<U+00E9>dulas de erecci<U+00F3>n|publisher=Universidad Nacional Aut<U+00F3>noma de M<U+00E9>xico|location=Mexico City|year=1990|pages=93<U+2013>100|isbn=9683617042|oclc=25290441|accessdate=2009-10-19|language=Spanish}}</ref> and brought to a definitive closure in 1867 by [[Benito Ju<U+00E1>rez]] and his fellow [[Mexican Liberal Party|Liberals]].<ref name="garciadiego2"/> Instead of reviving what he saw as an anachronistic institution with strong ties to the [[Roman Catholic Church]],<ref name="discursoSierra">{{citeweb|author = [[Justo Sierra]]| title = Discurso en el acto de la inauguraci<U+00F3>n de la Universidad Nacional de M<U+00E9>xico, el 22 de septiembre de 1910 | publisher = Universidad Nacional Aut<U+00F3>noma de M<U+00E9>xico | url = http://www.ses.unam.mx/docencia/Lectura1.pdf | language = Spanish |format=PDF}}</ref> he aimed to create a new university, secular in nature and national in scope, that could reorganize higher education within the country, serve as a model of [[positivism]] and encompass the ideas of the dominant Mexican liberalism.<ref name="discursoJustoSierra">{{cite web|author=[[Justo Sierra]]|title =Discurso en el acto de la inauguraci<U+00F3>n de la Universidad Nacional de M<U+00E9>xico, el 22 de septiembre de 1910| url = http://www.ses.unam.mx/docencia/Lectura1.pdf | date=1910-09-22 |language=Spanish |format=PDF}}</ref>

The project initially unified the Fine Arts, Business, Political Science, Jurisprudence, Engineering, Medicine, [[Normal School|Normal]] and the [[Escuela Nacional Preparatoria|National Preparatory]] schools;<ref name="antecedentes">{{cite web |url=  http://www.unam.mx/acercaunam/unam_tiempo/unam/antecedentes.html  |title= UNAM through time <U+2013> 1960 |accessdate=2009-10-18 }} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref> its first [[rector]] was [[Joaquin Egu<U+00ED>a y Lis]].<ref name="about1910">{{cite web |url= http://www.unam.mx/EN/aboutunam/unam_tiempo/unam/1910.html |title= UNAM through time <U+2013> 1910 |accessdate=2009-10-18 }} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref> 

The new university's challenges were mostly political, due to the ongoing [[Mexican Revolution]] and the fact that the federal government had direct control over the university's policies and curriculum; some resisted its establishment on philosophical grounds. This opposition led to disruptions in the function of the university when political instability forced resignations in the government, including that of President D<U+00ED>az. Internally, the first student strike occurred in 1912 to protest examination methods introduced by the director of the School of Jurisprudence, [[Luis Cabrera]]. By July of that year, a majority of the law students decided to abandon the university and join the newly-created [[Escuela Libre de Derecho|Free School of Law]].<ref name="about1910"/>

In 1914, initial efforts to gain autonomy for the university failed.<ref name="about1910"/> In 1920, [[Jos<U+00E9> Vasconcelos]] became rector. In 1921, he created the school's coat-of-arms: the image of an eagle and a condor surrounding a map of [[Latin America]], from Mexico's northern border to [[Tierra del Fuego]], and the motto, "The Spirit shall speak for my race." Efforts to gain autonomy for the university continued in the early 1920s. In the mid-1920s, a second wave of student strikes opposed a new grading system. The strikes included major classroom walkouts in the law school and confrontation with police at the medical school. The striking students were supported by many professors and subsequent negotiations eventually led to autonomy for the university. The institution was no longer a dependency of the [[Secretariat of Public Education]]; the university rector became the final authority, eliminating much of the prior duplicity in authority.<ref name="about1920">{{cite web |url= http://www.unam.mx/EN/aboutunam/unam_tiempo/unam/1920.html |title= UNAM through time <U+2013> 1920 |accessdate=2009-10-18 }} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref>

[[Image:PalacioUNAMAutonomiaDF.JPG|right|thumb|''Palacio de la Autonom<U+00ED>a'', located off Moneda Street east of the [[Zocalo]].]]
In 1943, initial decisions were made to move the university from the various buildings it occupied in the city center to a new and consolidated university campus; the new ''[[Ciudad Universitaria]]''  (lit. University City) would be in [[San <U+00C1>ngel]], to the south of the city.<ref name="about1940">{{cite web |url= http://www.unam.mx/EN/aboutunam/unam_tiempo/unam/1940.html  |title= UNAM through time <U+2013> 1940 |accessdate=2009-10-18 }} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref> The first stone laid was that of the [[Faculty (university)|faculty]] of Sciences, the first building of Ciudad Universitaria. President [[Miguel Alem<U+00E1>n Vald<U+00E9>s]] participated in the ceremony on 20 November 1952. The [[University Olympic Stadium]] was inaugurated on the same day. In 1957, the Doctorate Council was created to regulate and organize graduate studies.<ref name="about1950">{{cite web |url= http://www.unam.mx/EN/aboutunam/unam_tiempo/unam/1950.html  |title= UNAM through time <U+2013> 1950 |accessdate=2009-10-18 }} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref>

Another major student strike, again over examination regulations, occurred in 1966. Students invaded the [[rectorate]] and forced the rector to resign. The Board of Regents did not accept this resignation, so the professors went on strike, paralyzing the university and forcing the Board's acceptance. In the summer, violent outbreaks occurred on a number of the campuses of the University-affiliated preparatory schools; police took over a number of high school campuses, with injuries. During August 1968, protests formed on the main campus against the police actions on the main campus and in the center of the city. The protests grew into a student movement that demanded the resignation of the police chief, among other things. More protests followed in September, gaining frequency and numbers. During a meeting of the student leaders, the army fired on the Chihuahua building in [[Tlatelolco]], where the student organization supposedly was. They also fired on the crowd that was outside, with many dead, wounded and detained. Protests continued after that. Only ten days later, the [[1968 Summer Olympics|1968 Olympic Games]] opened at the University Stadium. The University was shut down for the duration. Finally, some progress was made toward restoring order.<ref name="about1960">{{cite web |url= http://www.unam.mx/EN/aboutunam/unam_tiempo/unam/1960.html |title= UNAM through time <U+2013> 1960 |accessdate=2009-10-18 }} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref>

The 1970s and 1980s saw the opening of satellite campuses in other parts of Mexico and nearby areas, to decentralize the system. There were some minor student strikes, mostly concerning grading and tuition.<ref name="about1970">{{cite web |url= http://www.unam.mx/EN/aboutunam/unam_tiempo/unam/1970.html |title= UNAM through time <U+2013> 1970 |accessdate=2009-10-18 }} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref><ref name="about1980">{{cite web |url= http://www.unam.mx/EN/aboutunam/unam_tiempo/unam/1980.html |title= UNAM through time <U+2013> 1980 |accessdate=2009-10-18 }} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref> The [[1999 UNAM strike|last major student strike]] at the university occurred in 1999<U+2013>2000 when students shut down the campus for almost a year to protest a proposal to charge students the equivalent of [[USD|US$]]150 per semester for those who could afford it.  Referendums were held by both the university and the strikers, but neither side accepted the others' results. Acting on a judge's order, the police stormed the buildings held by strikers on 7 February 2000, putting an end to the strike.<ref name="NYT">Preston, Julia (1999)[http://www.nytimes.com/library/world/americas/060899mexico-student-strike.html ''University Officials Yield to Student Strike in Mexico''] June 8.

==Campuses==
===University City===
{{Main|Ciudad Universitaria}}
[[Image:UNAM Ciudad Universitaria.jpg|right|thumb|275px|''The main campus in [[Mexico City]].]]
"Ciudad Universitaria" (University City) is UNAM's main campus, located within the [[Coyoac<U+00E1>n]] borough in the southern part of Mexico City. It was designed by architects [[Mario Pani]], [[Enrique del Moral]], [[Domingo Garc<U+00ED>a Ramos]], [[Armando Franco Rovira]] and others, and it encloses the [[Estadio Ol<U+00ED>mpico Universitario]], about 40 faculties and institutes, the Cultural Center, an ecological reserve, the [[Central Library (UNAM)|Central Library]], and a few museums. It was built during the 1950s on an ancient solidified lava bed to replace the scattered buildings in downtown [[Mexico City]], where classes were given. It was completed in 1954, and is almost a separate region within Mexico City, with its own regulations, councils, and police (to some extent), in a more fundamental way than most universities around the world. 

In June 2007, its main campus, [[Ciudad Universitaria]], was declared a [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]].<ref>[http://whc.unesco.org/en/news/364 UNESCO]</ref>

===Satellite campuses===
Apart from Ciudad Universitaria, UNAM has several campuses in the [[Greater Mexico City|Metropolitan Area of Mexico City]] (Acatl<U+00E1>n, Arag<U+00F3>n, Cuautitl<U+00E1>n, Iztacala, [[Xochimilco]] and Zaragoza), as well as many others in several locations across Mexico (in [[Santiago de Quer<U+00E9>taro]], [[Morelia]], [[M<U+00E9>rida, Yucat<U+00E1>n|M<U+00E9>rida]], [[Ensenada, Baja California|Ensenada]], and [[Cuernavaca]]), mainly aimed at research and graduate studies. It has also four small foreign campuses in the United States and Canada, focusing on the [[Spanish language]] and Mexican culture: [http://www.unamsanantonio.unam.mx/ UNAM San Antonio, Texas]; [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]]; [[Los Angeles]], [[California]]; [[Gatineau]], [[Quebec]].

[[Image:Torre de Rector<U+00ED>a.jpg|right|thumb|250 px|The [[Rectorate]] tower.]]
UNAM is organized in [[Faculty (university)|faculties]], rather than [[Academic department|departments]]. Both [[undergraduate]] and [[Postgraduate education|graduate]] studies are available. UNAM is also responsible for the [[Escuela Nacional Preparatoria]] (ENP) [http://dgenp.unam.mx (National Preparatory School)], and the [[Colegio de Ciencias y Humanidades]] (CCH)
[http://www.cch.unam.mx (Science and Humanities College)], which consist of several [[high school]]s, in [[Mexico City]]. Counting ENEP, CCH, FES [http://www.zaragoza.unam.mx (Facultad de Estudios Profesionales)] undergraduate and graduate students, UNAM has over 314,557  students, making it one of the [[world's largest universities]]<ref name="uno" />.

=== Faculties and National Schools ===

UNAM recognizes two different types of university schools: [[Faculty (university)|Faculties]] and National Schools. Only faculties have postgraduate studies. Currently, most of the schools, either inside or outside the University City, have this title. A National School is an institution that cannot offer all postgraduate studies ([[Master's degrees]] and [[Doctorates]]). This is the case of the [[National School of Music]], the [[National School of Arts]], the [[National School of Nursery and Obstetrics]], and the [[National School of Social Work]].<ref name="unidades_academicas">{{cite-web |url=http://www.unam.mx/pagina/es/8/docencia-unidades-academicas |title=Unidades Acad<U+00E9>micas |accessdate=September 17, 2010}}</ref>

==Research==

[[Image:2.12m Telescope-SanPedroMartir Observatory-BajaCalifornia-Mexico.jpg|right|thumb|250 px|The university's [[National Astronomical Observatory (Mexico)|San Pedro M<U+00E1>rtir Observatory]] in [[Baja California]].]]

UNAM has excelled in many areas of research and houses many of Mexico's premiere research institutions. In recent years, it has attracted students and hired professional scientists from all over the world (most notably from Russia, India and the United States), {{Citation needed|date=March 2008}} which has created a unique and diverse scientific community.

Scientific research at UNAM is divided between faculties, institutes, centers and schools, and covers a range of disciplines in [[Latin America]]. Some of the more noted institutes include: the Institute of Astronomy, the Institute of Biotechnology, the Institute of Nuclear Sciences, the Institute of Ecology, the Institute of Physics, the Institute of Cell Physiology, the Institute of Geophysics, the Institute of Engineering, the Institute of Materials Research, the Institute of Chemistry, the Institute of Biomedical Sciences, and the [[IIMAS|Applied Mathematics and Systems Research Institute]].

Research centers tend to focus on multidisciplinary problems particularly relevant to Mexico and the developing world, most notably, the Center of Applied Sciences and Technological Development, which focuses on connecting the sciences to real-world problems (e.g., optics, nanosciences), and Center of Energy Research, which conducts world-class research in alternative energies.

All research centers are open to students from Mexico and around the world. The UNAM holds a number of programs for students within the country, using scientific internships to encourage research in the country.

UNAM's scientific output continues to grow; despite numerous attempts by the Mexican government to curtail its budget, the University currently produces 60% of all scientific publications in Mexico.{{Citation needed|date = September 2008}}

As for basic sciences, UNAM currently has two [[Howard Hughes Medical Institute]] Scholars and an endowment from the [[NIH]] extramural research program.{{Citation needed|date = September 2008}}

Each school builds an ofrenda, and in the center, there is usually a large ofrenda made according to a theme corresponding to the festivities of the University for that year.<ref>[http://cronica.com.mx/nota.php?id_nota=150899 Noticias - En D<U+00ED>a de Muertos en la UNAM imponen r<U+00E9>cord; decenas de calles del DF tienen nombres alusivos a La Catrina<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

===Political activism===

UNAM students and professors are regarded throughout Mexico as very politically-aware and sometimes intensely politically active. While most of its students usually adhere to [[left-wing]] political ideologies and movements, the University has also borne a number of prominent [[right-wing]] and [[neo-liberal]] politicians, including [[Carlos Salinas de Gortari]] and [[Manuel G<U+00F3>mez Mor<U+00ED>n]].

===Student associations===

The UNAM contains several associations of current students and alumni that provide extra-curricular activities to the whole community, enriching the University's activities with cultural, social and scientific events.
