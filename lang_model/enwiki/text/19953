'''RAF Cranage''' was a [[Royal Air Force]] station during the Second World War. Located just to the North of Middlewich, Cheshire, [[England]]. 

==History==
The site at Cranage was chosen for a training base and aircraft maintenance unit in August 1939. Originally just a grass airfield three runways were late built from American metal plank. The airfield unusual had 8 blister hangars for maintenance use. 

The first flying unit was No. 2 School of Air Navigation which was formed on 21 October 1940, it used the twin-engined [[Avro Anson]] for training navigators. In 1942 the unit was renamed the [[Central Navigation School]] and the strength was increased to 58 Ansons, later joined two years later by a number of [[Vickers Wellington|Wellingtons]] in the same role. 

As well as the training role the airfield also housed and operational squadron from December 1940 with the formation of [[No. 96 Squadron RAF|96 Squadron]] with [[Hawker Hurricane]]. The unit operated in the night air-defence role mainly in the protection of industrial and port areas of [[Liverpool]]. 

Situated close to the airfield at Byley was a Vickers-Armstrongs shadow factory assembling [[Vickers Wellington]]s, the completed aircraft were towed to the airfield for their first flights and onwards delivery. In July 1942 [[No. 1531 Flight RAF|1531 Flight]] was formed as a Beam Approach Training Flight using the [[Airspeed Oxford]]. Aircrew were taught the techniques of the then new airfield approach aid. The maintenance site was also used by the United States Army Air Force and a small [[L-5 Sentinel|Sentinel]]-equipped liaison flight was also based.

After the second world war the only flying unit was No. 190 Gliding School which was formed in May 1945 and operated from the airfield for two years, with their departure flying ceased at Cranage. The airfield was used for storage and maintenance until 1958 when it finally closed.
