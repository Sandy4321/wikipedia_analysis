'''''Djaoeh Dimata'''''{{efn|Various contemporary spellings also include ''Djaoeh di Mata'', ''Djauh Dimata'', and ''Djauh di Mata''.}} ({{IPA-id|d<U+0292>a<U+02C8>u di<U+02C8>mata|}}; [[EYD|Perfected Spelling]]: '''''Jauh Dimata'''''; Indonesian for ''Out of Sight'') is a 1948 film from what is now Indonesia{{efn|The film was released during the [[Indonesian National Revolution]], in which time Indonesia had declared itself independent while the [[Dutch East Indies]] was still formally in existence.}} written and directed by [[Andjar Asmara]] for the South Pacific Film Corporation (SPFC). Starring [[Ratna Asmara]] and Ali Yugo, it follows a woman who goes to [[Jakarta]] to find work after her husband is blinded in an accident. SPFC's first production, ''Djaoeh Dimata'' took two to three months to film and cost almost 130,000 [[Netherlands Indies gulden|gulden]].

The first [[list of films of the Dutch East Indies|domestically produced]] feature film to be released in five years, ''Djaoeh Dimata'' received favourable reviews, although financially it was outperformed by [[Roestam Sutan Palindih]]'s ''Air Mata Mengalir di Tjitarum'' (released soon after). The film's cast remained active in the Indonesian film industry, some for another thirty years, and SPFC produced six more works before closing in 1949. A copy of the film is stored at [[Sinematek Indonesia]].

==Plot==
A poor villager Asrad (Ali Yugo) is blinded following a traffic accident and thus unable to work. As a result, his wife Soelastri ([[Ratna Asmara]]) travels to the capital, [[Jakarta]], to find a job. As Asrad does not trust his wife and fears she may be unfaithful, he writes her a letter telling her to not come back. Soelastri becomes a singer, and&nbsp;<U+2013> unknown to Asrad&nbsp;<U+2013> soon achieves wide acclaim. Her most popular song, "Djaoeh Dimata", receives heavy airplay on the radio and soon becomes one of Asrad's favourites. Ultimately Soelastri is brought home by Soekarto (Iskandar Sucarno), who attempts to pass her off as a maid for Asrad. When Asrad recognises his wife's voice, they are reconciled.<ref>{{harvnb|Filmindonesia.or.id, Djaoeh Dimata}}; {{harvnb|Het Dagblad 1949, 'Djaoeh di Mata'}}</ref>

==Background==
The first two years of the 1940s saw a growth in the cinema of the [[Dutch East Indies]], with over forty [[List of films of the Dutch East Indies|domestic productions]] released.{{sfn|Biran|2009|pp=385<U+2013>387}} Following the [[Japanese occupation of Indonesia|Japanese occupation]] in February 1942, production slowed greatly and nearly all film studios were closed. The last studio, the [[Chinese Indonesians|ethnic Chinese]]-owned Multi Film, was confiscated by the Japanese to establish the film production company Nippon Eigasha in Jakarta, the colony's capital. This included Multi Film's equipment, with which Nippon Eigasha produced one feature film&nbsp;<U+2013> [[Rd Ariffien]]'s ''[[Berdjoang]]'' (''Struggle''; 1943)&nbsp;<U+2013> six short films, and several [[newsreel]]s. All were [[Japanese propaganda during World War II|pro-Japanese propaganda]].{{sfn|Biran|2009|pp=339<U+2013>343}}

After the [[Surrender of Japan|Japanese surrender]] in August 1945, a number of [[native Indonesian]] employees of Nippon Eigasha formed [[Berita Film Indonesia]], which first made use of the studios. This company was allied with the newly [[proclamation of Indonesian Independence|proclaimed]] Indonesian government.{{sfn|Danujaya|Tjasmadi|1992|p=50}} During the ensuing [[Indonesian National Revolution|revolution]], allied Dutch and British forces occupied Jakarta in November 1945. The Dutch took over the studio, and production of [[newsreels]] at Multi Film's studios began in 1947 under the banner Regerings Film Bedrijf. The following year the Dutch established a subsidiary company to produce [[fictional film]]s. This new company, the South Pacific Film Corporation (SPFC), was subsidised in part by the [[Netherlands Indies Civil Administration]], a continuation of the former Dutch colonial government of the Indies.{{sfn|Biran|2009|p=359}}

SPFC hired [[Andjar Asmara]], a former journalist and stagewriter who had been active with [[The Teng Chun]]'s Java Industrial Film before the Japanese occupation, to direct ''Djaoeh Dimata'';{{sfn|Encyclopedia of Jakarta, Andjar Asmara}} he based the screenplay on his stageplay of the same name.{{sfn|Sumardjo|1992|p=247}} However, as with his pre-war ventures, the native Indonesian Andjar was more of an acting and [[dialogue coach]]; the Dutch cinematographer, A.A. Denninghoff-Stelling, held more creative power over the final product.{{sfn|Biran|2009|p=359}} [[Max Tera]] served as assistant cinematographer on this [[black-and-white]] film.{{sfn|Filmindonesia.or.id, Max Tera}}

The film starred Ratna Asmara (wife of Andjar), Ali Yugo, Iskandar Sucarno, and Djauhari Effendi,{{efn|Sources do not indicate Effendi's role.}}{{sfn|Filmindonesia.or.id, Kredit Djaoeh Dimata}} all of whom had previous theatrical experience. Ratna and Ali, together with Andjar, had been members of the travelling troupe [[Dardanella (theatre company)|Dardanella]] in the early 1930s and entered the film industry together in 1940 with ''[[Kartinah]]''.<ref>{{harvnb|Filmindonesia.or.id, Ali Yugo}}; {{harvnb|Encyclopedia of Jakarta, Andjar Asmara}}</ref> Iskandar and Djauhari, meanwhile, had been active in the theatre during the occupation; both made their feature film debuts with ''Djaoeh Dimata''.<ref>{{harvnb|Filmindonesia.or.id, Djauhari Effendi}}; {{harvnb|Filmindonesia.or.id, Iskander Sucarno}}; {{harvnb|Het Vrije Volk 1948, 'Djaoeh di Mata'}}</ref>

[[Principal photography]] was conducted on sets constructed by artistic director Hajopan Bajo Angin in SFPC's studio in Jakarta. The company's equipment was of good quality, but conditions were detrimental to filming; a contemporary report notes that one [[take]], done inside the studio, was ruined by the sound of a passing car.{{sfn|Limburgsch Dagblad 1948, In Batavia Wordt}} Filming, which took two{{sfn|De Vrije Pers 1948, Indonesische films}} to three months,{{sfn|Het Vrije Volk 1948, 'Djaoeh di Mata'}} was completed on 10 November 1948.{{sfn|Het Dagblad 1948, Camera draait}} Production costs were almost 130,000 [[Netherlands Indies gulden|gulden]],{{efn|At the time, 130,000 gulden was officially the equivalent to US$ 50,000, with an exchange rate at 2.6 gulden to the dollar. Owing to the war, however, the black market price of dollars was 4 to 5 times as much {{harv|Mooney 1948, Holland}}.}} which was partially obtained from ethnic Chinese backers.<ref>{{harvnb|Limburgsch Dagblad 1948, In Batavia Wordt}}; {{harvnb|De Vrije Pers 1948, Indonesische films}}</ref>

==Release and reception==
''Djaoeh Dimata'' was released in late 1948, the first domestic feature film since ''Berdjoang''.{{sfn|Said|McGlynn|Heider|1991|p=3}} Despite this five-year gap, film critic [[Usmar Ismail]] writes that it did not stray from the formula which had been proven before the war,{{sfn|Ismail|1983|pp=54<U+2013>56}} one which Indonesian film historian [[Misbach Yusa Biran]] notes focused on songs, beautiful scenery and romance.{{sfn|Biran|2009|p=25}} [[Roestam Sutan Palindih]]'s ''Air Mata Mengalir di Tjitarum'' (''Tears Flow in Citarum''), which had similar themes, was released shortly after ''Djaoeh Dimata'' by the rival Tan & Wong Bros.; it proved the greater financial success.{{sfn|Biran|2009|p=367}} Only three domestic productions were released in 1948; the last was another SPFC production, entitled ''Anggrek Bulan'' (''Moon Orchid''), which was also directed by Andjar.{{sfn|Biran|2009|p=385}}

Reviews were mixed. One in the Jakarta-based ''Het Dagblad'' found the film to have many (unspecified) weak moments as well as strong ones. It particularly praised Ali's acting as a blind man, as well as Denninghoff-Stelling's camerawork.{{sfn|Het Dagblad 1949, 'Djaoeh di Mata'}} Another reviewer, in the magazine ''Mestika'', described Ratna as an "unprecedented tragedienne"{{efn|Original: "''... een tragedienne zonder weerga''"}} capable of making viewers cry "unrestrained tears of emotion".{{efn|Original: "''... zijn tranen van ontroering, niet bedwingen kan.''"}}<ref>Quoted in {{harvnb|Het Nieuwsblad voor Sumatra 1949, Een 'Anak Medan'}}</ref>

Andjar directed two further films for South Pacific, ''Anggrek Bulan'' and ''[[Gadis Desa]]'' (''Maiden from the Village''; 1949).{{sfn|Encyclopedia of Jakarta, Andjar Asmara}} Ratna had no further acting roles, although in 1950 she became Indonesia's first female director with ''Sedap Malam'' (''Tuberose''), for [[Djamaluddin Malik]]'s company Persari.{{sfn|Swestin|2009|p=104}} Ali, Iskandar, and Djauhari remained active as actors, Ali and Iskandar through the 1960s and Djauhari until the 1970s.<ref>{{harvnb|Filmindonesia.or.id, Ali Yugo}}; {{harvnb|Filmindonesia.or.id, Djauhari Effendi}}; {{harvnb|Filmindonesia.or.id, Iskander Sucarno}}</ref> SPFC made another six films before shutting down at the end of the [[Indonesian National Revolution]] in 1949.{{Efn|The Dutch had recognised Indonesia's independence after [[Dutch<U+2013>Indonesian Round Table Conference|several months of negotiations]]. In the aftermath, the Indonesian government acquired Regerings Film Bedrijf, SPFC's parent company. It was merged with Berita Film Indonesia to form Perusahaan Pilem Negara (State Film Company), later renamed Perusahaan Film Negara {{harv|JCG, Berita Film Indonesia}}.}}{{sfn|Filmindonesia.or.id, South Pacific}} A [[35&nbsp;mm]] copy of ''Djaoeh Dimata'' is stored at [[Sinematek Indonesia]] in Jakarta.{{sfn|Filmindonesia.or.id, Djaoeh Dimata}}
