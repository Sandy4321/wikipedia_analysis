'''''Nostalgia, Ultra.''''' (stylized as "nostalgia, Ultra.") is the debut [[mixtape]] by American artist [[Frank Ocean]]. Ocean was  inspired to make the mixtape after he moved to [[Los Angeles]] following his hometown being hit by [[Hurricane Katrina]]. After joining [[alternative hip hop]] group [[OFWGKTA]] at the end of 2009, he [[self-released]] the mixtape on February 18, 2011, without initial promotion. It was made downloadable via Ocean's personal blog. The mixtape was noted for its surreal themes, its unique [[Contemporary R&B|R&B]] aesthetic and the nostalgic lyrical value. The content mostly focuses on interpersonal relationships, personal reflection and social commentary. Following its release, the mixtape received mostly positive reviews from [[music critics]], receiving an 80% on [[Metacritic]].

In May 2011, [[Def Jam]] announced its plans to release tracks from the mixtape as an [[Extended play|EP]] on July 26, 2011. However the release of the EP was indefinitely delayed in July 2011 and has since been cancelled. Two singles were released from the aborted EP version; "[[Novacane (song)|Novacane]]", and [[Swim Good]]". Both songs received music videos directed by [[Australian]] director [[Nabil Elderkin]]. "Novacane" received chart success on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] and both singles charted on the [[Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs]] chart. Ocean embarked on a solo concert tour through [[North America]] and [[Europe]] to promote the record, playing a total of 7 shows. Ocean performed both singles and several other songs from ''Nostalgia, Ultra'' during his concert tour.

The album appeared on several music critics' and publications' end-of-year albums lists, including ones published by [[Pitchfork Media]], ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', and ''[[The Guardian]]''. ''[[Complex (magazine)|Complex]]'' named it the second best mixtape of the year. "Novacane" was also listed as one of the best songs of the year by several publications. Recording artist [[Kanye West]] was reportedly a fan of the mixtape, which lead to him inviting Ocean to appear on his album ''[[Watch the Throne]]''. Subsequently, Ocean collaborated with recording artists [[Beyonc<U+00E9> Knowles]] and [[Jay-Z]] after they were introduced to the mixtape through West. Following its release, both Ocean and the mixtape have developed a [[cult following]].

== Background ==

However, he was initially unable to build a relationship with the company.<ref name="Complex Mag March 2011" /> In protest, Ocean joined the rap collective [[OFWGKTA]] which introduced him to artists like [[Tyler, The Creator]] and [[Hodgy Beats]].<ref name="blackbookmag1" /> During his time with the group he recorded and self-released ''Nostalgia, Ultra'' without any pre-release promotion on his [[Tumblr]] account.<ref name="Noz">{{cite web|last=Noz|first=Andrew|title=Frank Ocean: Smart And Subtle R&B Songwriting|url=http://www.npr.org/2011/04/21/135514908/frank-ocean-smart-and-subtle-r-b-songwriting?ps=cprs|publisher=[[NPR]]|accessdate=28 April 2011|date=2011-04-21}}</ref>

The mixtape samples songs from [[Radiohead]], [[Coldplay]], [[MGMT]], [[Mr. Hudson]] and [[The Eagles]], which Ocean sings over.<ref name="BBC"/> Ocean, when uploading the album to [[iTunes]], labeled it as "[[Bluegrass music|bluegrass]]" and "[[death metal]]", out of arbitrariness. When asked about why he uploaded the songs in that way, he replied; "I don't want to seem like I have a cause against genres, or maybe I do... Bluegrass is swag. Bluegrass is all the way swag."<ref name="Complex Mag March 2011" /> Ocean described the making of his mixtape as <U+201C>a labor of love. It was like difficult to make. Not like writing the songs [or] arranging the songs. That had a level of difficulty, too. But just piecing together all the levels to do it at the level, the quality of records I wanted to make<U+2026> But, it was a process I appreciate so much.<U+201D><ref name="numb">{{cite web|author=Montanna, Gina |url=http://www.xxlmag.com/xxl-magazine/2012/01/frank-ocean-says-odd-future-inspires-his-music-talks-making-of-nostalgia-ultra/ |title=Frank Ocean Says Odd Future Inspires His Music, Talks Making of Nostalgia Ultra | publisher= [[XXL (magazine)|XXL]] |date= January 6, 2011|accessdate=2011-05-20}}</ref>

In his own words, Ocean calls the album "[[nostalgic]]." He explains, "it's a longing for the past. That's what this record felt like."<ref name="Complex Mag March 2011" /> The lyrical content, according to Ocean, relates to heartbreak and other familiar tropes of interpersonal relationships: "I wasn't trying to make a record that people could relate to. I was just trying to make a record with the shit that I wanted to express. The shit that I wanted to get off my chest. [...] A lot of this record is influenced by one relationship, but I don't owe that whole project to one situation. It doesn't matter what the details of it are."<ref name="Complex Mag March 2011" /> Discussing the writing process behind the album, he mused "I guess I'm just inspired to tell stories."<ref name="mtv" /> He continued, "you gotta make sure the listener is listening to you, so if you put it into a song, often times, if the song is striking enough, then you can really deliver the story most effectively while keeping the ear of the listener the whole time. I guess it all starts with the stories for me."<ref name=mtv>{{cite web|author=Markman, Rob |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1676855/frank-ocean-album-bbc-news.jhtml |title=Frank Ocean Says Debut Album Will 'Define' Him |work=[[MTV]]|publisher=[[Viacom]] |date= January 6, 2011|accessdate=2011-05-20}}</ref>
