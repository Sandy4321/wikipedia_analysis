[[File:GameCube-Console-Set.png|thumb|The Capcom Five, as originally announced, represented an unprecedented level of [[video game development party|third-party developer]] support for [[Nintendo GameCube]].]]
The '''Capcom Five''' is a set of five [[video game]]s unveiled by [[Capcom]] in late 2002 and subsequently published beginning in March 2003. At a time when [[Nintendo]]'s [[Nintendo GameCube|GameCube]] [[video game console|console]] failed to capture [[market share]], Capcom announced five new GameCube titles with the apparent goal of boosting hardware sales and showing off [[video game development party|third-party developer]] support. Capcom USA followed up with confirmation that they would be [[console exclusivity|exclusive]] to the GameCube. The five games were ''[[P.N.03]]'', a futuristic [[third-person shooter]]; ''[[Viewtiful Joe]]'', a [[side-scrolling video game|side-scrolling]] [[action game|action]]-[[platform game|platformer]]; ''Dead Phoenix'', a [[shoot 'em up]]; ''[[Resident Evil 4]]'', a [[survival horror]] third-person shooter; and ''[[Killer7]]'', an [[action-adventure game]] with [[first-person shooter]] elements. Though not directly related to each other, they were all overseen by ''[[Resident Evil]]'' creator [[Shinji Mikami]] and, excepting ''Killer7'', developed by Capcom's Production Studio 4. Capcom USA later clarified that only ''Resident Evil 4'' was intended to be exclusive; the initial announcement was due to a miscommunication with their parent company.

Of the five games, ''Dead Phoenix'' was canceled and only ''P.N.03'' retained its status as a GameCube exclusive, though selling and reviewing poorly. ''Viewtiful Joe'' and ''Killer7'' sold modestly but gained a significant [[cult following]], the latter launching the career of creator [[Goichi Suda|Suda51]]. ''Resident Evil 4'' was the runaway success of the five, though its GameCube sales were undercut by the announcement of a [[Sony]] [[PlayStation 2]] [[porting|port]] to be released later that year. ''Viewtiful Joe'' also saw a PlayStation 2 version with expanded features and ''Killer7'' debuted on multiple platforms simultaneously. The Capcom Five case, particularly the loss of GameCube exclusivity for ''Resident Evil 4'', was said to have soured Nintendo<U+2013>Capcom relations for years to come. The series also represents another episode in Nintendo's ongoing quest for third-party developer support on a home console.

==Background==
During the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]] (NES) and [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System|Super Nintendo]] (SNES) eras, [[Nintendo]] and [[Capcom]] enjoyed a close relationship, with ''[[Mega Man]]'' being one of the NES' most prominent franchises.<ref name="kotaku">{{cite web|author=Plunkett, Luke |url=http://kotaku.com/5806800/remembering-capcoms-great-nintendo-promise--betrayal |title=Remembering Capcom's Great Nintendo Promise / Betrayal |publisher=Kotaku.com |date=2011-05-31 |accessdate=2011-09-04}}</ref> This closeness was partially due to Nintendo's [[monopoly]] of the [[video game console]] market, which allowed the company to force [[video game development party|third-party developers]] to release exclusive content according to Nintendo's schedule.<ref>{{cite web|author=Yoder, Benjamin |url=http://gamrfeed.vgchartz.com/story/87283/will-nintendo-ever-get-third-party-support-right/ |title=Will Nintendo Ever Get Third Party Support Right? |publisher=Gamrfeed |date=2011-07-21 |accessdate=2011-09-04}}</ref> [[Sega]]'s [[Mega Drive]] would force Nintendo to relax some of its restrictions on third parties with respect to the SNES. However, relations with third-party developers reached a turning point when Nintendo decided to retain a proprietary cartridge-based format for the [[Nintendo 64]], in the face of Sony's disc-based [[PlayStation]].<ref name="retroIGN">{{cite web|author=Buchanan, Levi |url=http://retro.ign.com/articles/914/914568p1.html |title=Nintendo 64 Week: Day Two |publisher=IGN |date=2008-09-30 |accessdate=2011-09-04}}</ref> Because of increased manufacturing costs and severely limited cartridge memory capacity, many third parties including Capcom moved to the PlayStation to start new franchises, such as ''[[Resident Evil]]''.<ref name="kotaku"/> On this new platform, developers could create bigger games while avoiding the restriction of ordering proprietary cartridges through Nintendo, which could lead to under- or [[excess inventory|over-stocking]] inventory.<ref name="retroIGN"/> This third party abandonment allowed the PlayStation to steal Nintendo's top spot.<ref name="kotaku"/>

==Release and reception==
''[[P.N.03]]'' is a [[science fiction]]-themed [[third-person shooter]], the first of the five to be released in Japan on March 27, 2003. The game features a dexterous protagonist named Vanessa Z.

''[[Viewtiful Joe]]'' is a [[2.5D]] [[side-scrolling video game|side-scrolling]] [[action game|action]]-[[platform game|platformer]], the second game released on June 26, 2003. The [[title role|title character]] is a parody of [[tokusatsu]] superheroes, trying to save his girlfriend, who has been trapped in "Movieland" by a group of supervillains known as Jadow. In order to complete his quest, Joe must use his Viewtiful Effects Powers, which are based on camera tricks and special effects used in films.<ref>{{cite book | year=2003 | editor=Capcom staff| title=Viewtiful Joe instruction manual | pages=19<U+2013>21 | publisher=[[Capcom|Capcom Entertainment Inc.]]}}</ref> These include "Slow", which simulates [[bullet time]]; "Mach Speed", allowing Joe to attack all enemies with his afterimages; and "Zoom In", which triggers a camera [[close-up]] and unlocks special attacks.

''[[Resident Evil 4]]'', a [[survival horror]] [[third-person shooter]], premiered on January 11, 2005, in North America, with a Japanese release on January 27. Players take on the role of [[Leon S. Kennedy]], a [[United States Secret Service]] agent who has been ordered to rescue the daughter of the President of the United States from a cult in rural [[hispanophone]] Europe. The cult has been using a [[mind control|mind-controlling]] [[parasite]] to turn local villagers into violent drones. The game went through numerous changes during its long development, with the team creating and discarding four older revisions before settling on the final product.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Kevin Gifford, Mark MacDonald |date=April 2005 |title=Afterthoughts: Resident Evil 4 |journal=Electronic Gaming Monthly |publisher=Ziff Davis Media Inc. |issue=190 |pages=51<U+2013>52}}</ref> Among those was a version directed by Hideki Kamiya which would be turned into the first ''[[Devil May Cry (video game)|Devil May Cry]]'' game.<ref>{{cite web |author=Kamiya, Hideki |url=http://www.capcom.co.jp/devil/column/vol010.html |title=The Story of the Scenario |date=July 2001 |work=Devil May Cry Column |publisher=Capcom Co., Ltd. |accessdate=2011-09-03}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |author=IGN staff |url=http://ps2.ign.com/articles/087/087835p1.html |title=New From Capcom: Devil May Cry |date=2000-11-15 |work=IGN |publisher=IGN |accessdate=2011-09-03}}</ref> Taking over directorial duties, Mikami made the fifth and final version very different compared to previous ''[[Resident Evil]]'' games, with an over-the-shoulder perspective and an increased emphasis on action and combat.<ref>{{cite web | author=Kemps, Heidi | date=2004-09-27 | url=http://cube.gamespy.com/gamecube/resident-evil-4/551775p2.html | title=Hiroyuki Kobayashi on Resident Evil 4 & Killer 7 | publisher=[[GameSpy]] | accessdate=2010-07-12}}</ref> ''Resident Evil 4'' was the only member of the five to remain confirmed as a GameCube exclusive; Mikami claimed that he would "cut off his own head" (a [[colloquialism]] for quitting his job) if it were to be released on another platform.<ref>{{cite web|last=Bailey, Kat |url=http://www.1up.com/news/shinji-mikami-launches-teaser-site |title=Shinji Mikami Launches Teaser Site with Harakiri Flash Game |publisher=1UP.com |date=2010-03-31 |accessdate=2011-09-04}}</ref> However, just two months before the game's January 2005 release, Capcom announced a PlayStation 2 port to be released nine months after the GameCube version in response to pressure from users and shareholders.<ref>{{cite web|author=IGN staff |url=http://cube.ign.com/articles/562/562367p1.html |title=Resident Evil 4 Exclusive No More |publisher=IGN |date=2004-10-31 |accessdate=2011-09-04}}</ref> This surprise announcement undercut the title's GameCube sales, which totaled 1.6 million, compared to the sales of the PlayStation 2 version, which exceeded 2 million.<ref name="Infendo"/><ref>{{cite web |url=http://ir.capcom.co.jp/english/data/million.html |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070621040246/http://ir.capcom.co.jp/english/data/million.html |archivedate=2007-06-21 |title=Platinum Titles |publisher=[[Capcom]] |accessdate=2011-09-03}}</ref> Despite these corporate conflicts, the game received an overwhelmingly positive critical response with Metacritic scores of 96 for both versions.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.metacritic.com/game/gamecube/resident-evil-4 |title=Resident Evil 4 (cube: 2005): Reviews |publisher=[[Metacritic]] |accessdate=2011-09-03}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/game/playstation-2/resident-evil-4 |title=Review: Resident Evil 4 (PS2) |publisher=Metacritic |accessdate=2011-09-03}}</ref> It went on to sweep many [[Game of the Year]] awards for 2005 and is consistently listed among the greatest games of all time.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Top 20 Best GameCube Games of All Time |journal=Nintendo Power |month=March |year=2005 |page=105}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |title=The Best of the Decade |journal=Nintendo Power |issue=252 |page=76 |month=March |year=2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |title=Top PlayStation Titles |journal=PlayStation Official Magazine |month=October |year=2010 |publisher=[[Future Publishing]] |issue=50}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://microsites.ign.com/kfc/top99games/10.html |title=Top 99 Games of All Time |accessdate=2011-09-03 |publisher=IGN}}</ref>

''[[Killer7]]'', released on June 9, 2005, is an [[action-adventure game]] with [[first-person shooter]] elements and an unconventional "[[Shoot 'em up|on rails]]" control scheme. Unlike other members of the five, ''Killer7'' was developed at [[Grasshopper Manufacture]] under the direction of [[Goichi Suda|Suda51]]. Players control the members of an elite group of assassins who are actually physical manifestations of a god-like being named Harman Smith. The game restricts the player's movement to specific branching paths through the environment and can only attack while stationary in first-person view. This stripped-down control scheme was implemented as a [[deconstruction]] of how gamers play.<ref name="punk">{{cite web | author=Low, David | date=2007-04-18 | url=http://www.gamasutra.com/php-bin/news_index.php?story=13578 | title=Suda51 Talks Emotion In Games, 'Breaking Stuff' | publisher=[[Gamasutra]] | accessdate=2011-09-04}}</ref> Gameplay was not finalized until late in development since Suda51 concentrated most resources on story and visual work.<ref name="K7IGN">{{cite web | author=Casamassina, Matt | date=2005-07-01 | url=http://ps2.ign.com/articles/630/630984p1.html | title=Killer 7 | publisher=IGN | accessdate=2011-09-04}}</ref> This back-loading of development resulted in several delays, the last of which was due to an artistic desire to release the game on July 7 (7/7) in North America.<ref>{{cite web | author=Castro, Juan | date=2005-05-31 | url=http://cube.ign.com/articles/620/620533p1.html | title=Killer 7 Delayed | publisher=IGN | accessdate=2011-09-04}}</ref> ''Killer7'' debuted as a multi-console release, the only one of the five to do so, to polarized reviews.

==Legacy==
The Capcom Five announcement came at a time when Nintendo had been struggling with its new console, with the apparent goal of supporting the fledgling system. However, with each successive game's release, Capcom realized the GameCube's improfitability and ported the games one by one to Sony's PlayStation 2.<ref name="Capcom"/> These ports were generally inferior in quality, with many reviewers noting slowdown issues and lower resolution graphics.<ref name="CloverVision"/><ref name="K7IGN"/><ref>{{cite web|author=Mirabella III, Fran |url=http://ps2.ign.com/articles/660/660397p4.html |title=Resident Evil 4 Review |publisher=IGN |date=2005-10-21 |accessdate=2011-09-04}}</ref> Ultimately, only four games were released and only one would remain exclusive to GameCube.<ref name="kotaku"/> This lone GameCube exclusive was ''P.N.03'' and not ''Resident Evil 4'' as Capcom had repeatedly emphasized in press releases. The whole incident was a blow to GameCube owners and Nintendo fans who had seen the Capcom Five as a promise of things to come for the faltering console.<ref name="kotaku"/> Luke Plunkett of [[Kotaku]] noted that despite best intentions, Capcom's five even at their full potential could not have made up for the GameCube's failings in that generation's [[console wars]].<ref name="kotaku"/>

Through this event, Capcom had learned a few lessons which it would apply in the coming years. The first they learned over the course of the five's release, namely to focus on multi-platform releases and avoid GameCube where possible. Second, they discovered that they needed to streamline development. Prior to the five, Capcom had announced losses of [[United States dollar|US$]]103 million for [[fiscal year]] 2002, largely due to poor sales and extended development times.<ref name="Infendo"/> ''Resident Evil 4'' was a particularly notable example, beginning development in 1999 and going through four discarded versions by the time of its 2005 release.<ref>{{cite web |author=Perry, Douglass |url=http://ps2.ign.com/articles/072/072895p1.html |title=Resident Evil Series to Haunt PlayStation 2 |date=1999-12-03 |work=IGN.com |publisher=IGN Entertainment, Inc. |accessdate=2011-09-04}}</ref> The third lesson was to focus on old franchises rather than create new ones; ''Resident Evil 4'' was the only unmitigated commercial success of the five and also the only game based on an existing property. To wit, ''[[Viewtiful Joe 2]]'' was started shortly after the release of ''Viewtiful Joe'' and completed just a year later.<ref>{{cite web| author=IGN staff | date=2004-05-14 | title=E3 2004: Interview: Atsushi Inaba | url=http://cube.ign.com/articles/515/515440p1.html | publisher=IGN | accessdate=2011-09-04}}</ref> However, the brisk schedule meant that the team was not given time to implement all the features they had wanted including a [[cooperative gameplay]] mode.<ref>{{cite web| author=Bramwell, Tim | date=2004-10-20 | title=Viewtiful Joe 2 stripped of co-op mode News | url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/news201004vj2 | publisher=[[Eurogamer]] | accessdate=2011-09-04}}</ref> ''Viewtiful Joe 2'' debuted on both GameCube and PlayStation 2 in order to reach a wider audience and maximize profitability.

To facilitate ''Viewtiful Joe 2''{{'}}s development, Capcom spun out [[Clover Studio]], formed from members of "Team Viewtiful", as a semi-autonomous production studio with a focus on developing new [[intellectual property|intellectual properties]] (IPs).<ref name="CloverOver">{{cite web|author=Sheffield, Brandon |url=http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/1798/capcom__clover_over_and_over_.php |title=Capcom & Clover, Over and Over: Former Clover Head Atsushi Inaba on a Post-Capcom World |publisher=Gamasutra |date=2006-10-23 |accessdate=2011-09-04}}</ref> The separation was also in part due to ''Resident Evil 4''{{'}}s PlayStation 2 release, which caused significant tensions between the Capcom and Mikami who had touted the game's exclusivity.<ref>{{cite web|author=Trinkwon, Gareth |url=http://nerdmentality.com/article/542/resident-evil-in-jeopardy/ |title=Resident Evil In Jeopardy |publisher=NerdMentality |date=2004-11-10 |accessdate=2011-09-04}}</ref> Clover Studio was able to produce two more games in the ''Viewtiful Joe'' series, which serve as side-stories, and commissioned an [[Viewtiful Joe (anime)|anime adaptation]] which was produced by [[Group TAC]].

Outside of Capcom, ''Killer7'' served as a turning point for [[Goichi Suda|Suda51]] and his studio, [[Grasshopper Manufacture]], effectively launching his career. With Capcom as publisher, ''Killer7'' was Suda51's first game to be released outside Japan.

Despite the relative failure of the project as a whole, the individual games of the Capcom Five had a lasting impact on game design. After experimenting with action gameplay in ''P.N.03'', Mikami was able to apply his experience to ''Resident Evil 4'' with "The Mercenaries", an arcade-style monster-slaying [[minigame]] whose objective is to score points through combos within a time limit.<ref>{{cite web|author=Pro Daisy |url=http://pietriots.com/2011/08/30/the-capcom-five-video-memorial/ |title=The Capcom Five <U+2013> Video Memorial |publisher=Pietriots.com |date=2011-08-30 |accessdate=2011-09-07}}</ref> On the other hand, Adam Sorice of [[Nintendojo]] has suggested that ''P.N.03''{{'}}s stereotypical portrayal of women had unfortunate implications for [[video game controversy#Gender|gender equality in gaming]].<ref>{{cite web|author=Sorice, Adam |url=http://www.nintendojo.com/features/specials/the-capcom-five-requiem-for-a-dream |title=The Capcom Five: Requiem for a Dream |publisher=Nintendojo |date=2011-01-25 |accessdate=2011-09-07}}</ref> He also suggested that the commercial failure of ''P.N.03'' has made Capcom reluctant to feature strong female protagonists in their games.

For Nintendo, Capcom's reversal on GameCube exclusivity, particularly with ''Resident Evil 4'', was a betrayal that soured relations between the two companies for several years.
