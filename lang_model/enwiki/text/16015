The '''A<U+00E9>rospatiale-BAC Concorde''' is a [[turbojet]]-powered [[supersonic]] passenger [[airliner]], a [[supersonic transport]] (SST). It was a product of an Anglo-French government treaty, combining the manufacturing efforts of [[A<U+00E9>rospatiale]] and the [[British Aircraft Corporation]]. First flown in 1969, Concorde entered service in 1976 and continued for 27 years.

Among other destinations, Concorde flew regular transatlantic flights from [[London Heathrow]] (British Airways) and [[Paris-Charles de Gaulle Airport]] (Air France) to [[John F. Kennedy International Airport|New York JFK]] and [[Washington Dulles International Airport|Washington Dulles]], profitably flying these routes at record speeds, in less than half the time of other airliners.

With only 20 aircraft built, the development phase represented a substantial economic loss. Additionally, [[Air France]] and [[British Airways]] were subsidised by their governments to buy the aircraft. As a result of the type<U+2019>s [[Air France Flight 4590|only crash]] on 25 July 2000, [[economic effects arising from the 11 September attacks]], and other factors, operations ceased on 24 October 2003. The last retirement flight occurred on 26 November 2003.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/bristol/somerset/3238674.stm |title = Last Concorde lands |publisher = ''BBC News'' |date = 27 November 2003}}</ref>

Regarded by many as an aviation icon,<ref name="Concorde beats"/> Concorde has acquired an unusual [[nomenclature]] for an aircraft. In common usage in the United Kingdom, the type is known as "Concorde" rather than "''the'' Concorde" or "''a'' Concorde".<ref>Note this British convention is used throughout this article: {{cite web |url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/in_depth/uk/2003/concorde_retirement/default.stm |title = In depth: Farewell to Concorde |publisher = ''BBC News'' |date = 15 August 2007}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.britishairways.com/concorde/aboutconcorde.html |title = About Concorde - main page |publisher = ''British Airways'' |accessdate =11 January 2010}}</ref>

In the late 1950s, the United Kingdom, France, United States and [[Soviet Union]] were considering developing supersonic transport. The British [[Bristol Aeroplane Company]] and the French [[Sud Aviation]] were both working on designs, called the [[Bristol 223|Type 223]] and [[Sud Aviation Super-Caravelle|Super-Caravelle]], respectively. Both were largely funded by their respective governments.<ref name="earlyhist">[http://www.concordesst.com/history/eh1.html#a "Early History."] ''concordesst.com''. Retrieved: 8 September 2007.</ref> The British design was for a thin-winged delta shape<ref name = 'deltawing'>{{cite journal |url = http://md1.csa.com/partners/viewrecord.php?requester=gs&collection=TRD&recid=A6825061AH&q=Concorde+Delta&uid=788872723&setcookie=yes |title = The development of the slender delta concept |journal = Aircraft Engineering |author = Maltby, R.L. |vol = 40 |year = 1968}}</ref> (which owed much to work by [[Dietrich K<U+00FC>chemann]]) for a transatlantic-ranged aircraft for about 100 people, while the French were intending to build a medium-range aircraft.<ref name="earlyhist"/>

The designs were both ready to start prototype construction in the early 1960s, but the cost was so great that the British government made it a requirement that BAC look for international co-operation.<ref name="earlyhist"/> Approaches were made to a number of countries, but only France showed real interest. The development project was negotiated as an international [[treaty]] between the two countries rather than a commercial agreement between companies and included a clause, originally asked for by the UK, imposing heavy penalties for cancellation. A draft treaty was signed on 28 November 1962. By this time, both companies had been merged into new ones; thus, the Concorde project was between the [[British Aerospace|British Aircraft Corporation]] and [[A<U+00E9>rospatiale]].<ref name="earlyhist"/>

At first the new consortium intended to produce one long range and one short range version. However, prospective customers showed no interest in the short-range version and it was dropped.<ref name="earlyhist"/> The consortium secured orders (i.e., non-binding options) for over 100 of the long-range version from the major airlines of the day: [[Pan American World Airways|Pan Am]], [[British Overseas Airways Corporation|BOAC]] and Air France were the launch customers, with six Concordes each. Other airlines in the order book included [[Panair do Brasil]], [[Continental Airlines]], [[Japan Airlines]], [[Lufthansa]], [[American Airlines]], [[United Airlines]], [[Air India]], [[Air Canada]], [[Braniff International Airways|Braniff]], [[Singapore Airlines]], [[Iran Air]], [[Olympic Airways]], [[Qantas]], [[Civil Aviation Administration of China|CAAC]], [[Middle East Airlines]] and [[Trans World Airlines|TWA]].<ref name="earlyhist"/><ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,903850,00.html |title = Aerospace: Pan Am's Concorde Retreat |publisher = ''Time'' |date = 12 February 1973}}</ref>

The aircraft was initially referred to in the UK as "Concorde", with the French spelling, but was officially changed to "Concord" by [[Harold Macmillan]] in response to a perceived slight by [[Charles de Gaulle]].<ref name="earlyhist"/> In 1967, at the French roll-out in [[Toulouse]] the British Government [[Minister for Technology]], [[Tony Benn]] announced that he would change the spelling back to "Concorde".<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.guardian.co.uk/g2/story/0,3604,1064752,00.html |title = Sonic booms and that 'e' on the end: Tony Benn remembers his role in getting Concorde off the ground |first = Tony |last = Benn |publisher = ''The Guardian'' |date = 17 October 2003 | location=London}}</ref> This created a nationalist uproar that died down when Benn stated that the suffixed "e" represented "Excellence, England, Europe and [[Entente Cordiale|Entente (Cordiale)]]." In his memoirs, he recounts a tale of a letter from an irate Scotsman claiming: "[Y]ou talk about 'E' for England, but part of it is made in Scotland." Given Scotland<U+2019>s contribution of providing the nose cone for the aircraft, Benn replied, "[I]t was also 'E' for '<U+00C9>cosse' (the French name for Scotland)&nbsp;<U+2014> and I might have added 'e' for extravagance and 'e' for escalation as well!"<ref>McIntyre 1992, p. 20.</ref>

Construction of two prototypes began in February 1965: 001, built by Aerospatiale at Toulouse, and 002, by BAC at [[Filton]], [[Bristol]].

These trips led to orders for over 70 aircraft, but a combination of factors led to order cancellations: the [[1973 oil crisis]], financial difficulties of airlines, a spectacular Paris Le Bourget air show crash of the competing Soviet [[Tupolev Tu-144]], and environmental concerns such as the [[sonic boom]], [[takeoff]]-noise and pollution. By 1976 four nations remained as prospective buyers: Britain, France, China, and Iran.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://news.google.co.uk/newspapers?id=XJcUAAAAIBAJ&sjid=9a0DAAAAIBAJ&pg=4991,607322&dq=second+generation+concorde&hl=en |title = Concordes limited to 16 |publisher = ''Virgin Islands Daily News'' |date = 5 June 1976}}</ref> In the end only Air France and British Airways (the successor to [[BOAC]]) took up their orders, with the two governments taking a cut of any profits made. In the case of BA, 80% of the profit was kept by the government until 1984, while the cost of buying the aircraft was covered by a state loan.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.britishairways.com/concorde/faq.html#6 |title = Payments for Concorde |publisher = ''British Airways'' |accessdate = 2 December 2009}}</ref>

The United States cancelled the [[Boeing 2707]], its supersonic transport programme, in 1971. Industry observers in France and the United Kingdom suggested that part of the American opposition to Concorde on grounds of noise pollution was orchestrated, or at least encouraged, by the [[United States Government]], out of spite at not being able to propose a viable competitor,<ref>{{cite web |url = http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F50D16F93C54137A93C0A81789D85F478785F9 |title = "Britain and France have wasted billions on the Concorde" |publisher = ''New York Times'' |first = Anthony |last = Lewis |date = 12 February 1973}}</ref> despite President [[John F.

==Design==
===General features===
Concorde is an [[ogive|ogival]] (also "ogee") [[delta-wing]]ed aircraft with four [[Rolls-Royce/Snecma Olympus 593<U+200E>|Olympus]] engines based on those originally developed for the [[Avro Vulcan]] [[strategic bomber]]. Concorde was the first airliner to have an (in this case, analogue) [[fly-by-wire]], flight-control system; the avionics of Concorde were unique because it was the first commercial aircraft to employ [[Hybrid integrated circuit|hybrid circuit]]s.<ref name='elecflybywire' /> The principal designer for the project was Pierre Satre, with [[Archibald Russell|Sir Archibald Russell]] as his deputy.<ref>{{cite web |first = Peter |last = Masefield |url = http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4158/is_19950601/ai_n13985814 |title = Obituary: Sir Archibald Russell |publisher = ''[[The Independent]]'' |date = 1 July 1995}}</ref>

===Movement of centre of pressure===
[[File:2001concordewingduxfordJM.jpg|thumb|G-AXDN, Duxford, close up of pre-production engine nozzles. The nozzle/thrust reverser design was altered for the production Concordes.]]

When any aircraft passes the [[critical mach]] of that particular airframe, the [[centre of pressure]] shifts rearwards. This causes a pitch down force on the aircraft, as the centre of mass remains where it was. The engineers designed the wings in a specific manner to reduce this shift. However, there was still a shift of about 2&nbsp;metres. This could have been countered by the use of [[airfoil|trim controls]], but at such high speeds this would have caused a dramatic increase in the drag on the aircraft. Instead, the distribution of fuel along the aircraft was shifted during acceleration and deceleration to move the centre of mass, effectively acting as an auxiliary trim control.<ref name = 'fueltrim'>{{cite journal |url = http://www.emeraldinsight.com/Insight/viewContentItem.do?contentType=Article&hdAction=lnkpdf&contentId=1682642 |title = Flight Refuelling Limited and Concorde: The fuel system aboard is largely their work |journal = Aircraft Engineering and Aerospace Technology |publisher = MCB UP |volume = 48 |issue = 9 |issn = 0002-2667 |pages = 20<U+2013>21 |date = September 1976}}</ref>

===Engines===
{{Main|Rolls-Royce/Snecma Olympus 593}}

To be economically viable, Concorde needed to be able to fly long distances, and this required high efficiency. For optimum supersonic flight, turbofan engines were considered, but rejected, due to their larger cross-section which would cause excessive drag.  [[Turbojet]]s were found to be the best choice of engines.<ref>Birtles, Philip. ''Concorde'', pp. 62<U+2013>63. Vergennes, Vermont: Plymouth Press, 2000. ISBN 1882663446.</ref> The engine developed was the twin spool [[Rolls-Royce/Snecma Olympus 593]], a development of the Bristol engine first used for the [[Avro Vulcan]] bomber, and developed into an afterburning supersonic variant for the [[BAC TSR-2]] strike bomber.<ref name="wingweb">[http://www.wingweb.co.uk/engines/Olympus593_MK610.html "Rolls Royce Olympus history."] ''wingweb.co.uk''. Retrieved: 15 January 2010.</ref>

[[File:Concordeintake.gif|thumb|Concorde's ramp system schematics]]
[[File:Concorde Ramp.jpg|thumb|Concorde's ramp system]]

The inlet design for Concorde<U+2019>s engines was critical.<ref>{{cite journal |url = https://www.sae.org/technical/papers/912180 |title = Concorde Propulsion--Did we get it right? The Rolls-Royce/Snecma Olympus 593 Engine reviewed |publisher = ''SAE International'' |author = Ganley, G. A.  |date = September 1991}}</ref> All conventional jet engines can take in air at only around Mach 0.5; therefore the air has to be slowed from the Mach 2.0 airspeed that enters the engine inlet. In particular, Concorde needed to control the shock waves that this reduction in speed generates to avoid damage to the engines. This was done by a pair of [[intake ramp]]s and an auxiliary flap, whose position was moved during flight to slow the air down.<ref>{{cite journal |url = http://naca.central.cranfield.ac.uk/reports/arc/rm/3711.pdf |title = On the sub-critical stability of variable ramp intakes at Mach numbers around 2 |journal = Aeronautical Research Council |author = Fisher, S.A. |coauthors = M.C. Neale and A.J. Brooks |publisher = Her Majesty's Stationery Office |year = 1972}}</ref> The ramps were at the top of the engine compartment and moved down and the auxiliary flap moved both up and down allowing air to flow in or out. The effectiveness of the intake system is such that, during supersonic flight, 63% of the aircraft's thrust is attributed to the intakes whilst the exhaust nozzles generate 29% and the engines just 8% of the thrust.<ref name = 'powerplant'/>

Engine failure causes problems on conventional subsonic aircraft; not only does the aircraft lose thrust on that side but the engine creates drag, causing the aircraft to yaw and bank in the direction of the failed engine. If this had happened to Concorde at supersonic speeds, it could theoretically cause a catastrophic failure of the airframe.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.freepatentsonline.com/4935682.html |title = Full authority engine-out control augmentation subsystem: United States Patent 4935682 |publisher = ''freepatentsonline.com'' |first = Michael S. |last = Mccuen |date = 8 June 1990}}</ref> However, during an engine failure air intake needs are virtually zero, so in Concorde the immediate effects of the engine failure were countered by the opening of the auxiliary flap and the full extension of the ramps, which deflected the air downwards past the engine, gaining lift and streamlining the engine, minimising the drag effects of the failed engine. Although computer simulations predicted considerable difficulties, in practice Concorde was able to shut down both engines on the same side of the aircraft at Mach 2 without any of the predicted control problems.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.flightglobal.com/articles/2003/10/21/172657/concorde-special-the-test-pilot-john-cochrane.html |title = Concorde Special - The test pilot - John Cochrane |publisher = ''Flight International'' |date = 21 October 2003}}</ref> Concorde pilots were routinely trained in simulators to deal with a double engine failure.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-63710463.html |title = How a Concorde pilot would handle a nightmare failure |publisher = ''Birmingham Post'' |first = Peter |last = Woodman |date = 27 July 2000}}</ref>

The aircraft used reheat ([[afterburner]]s) at takeoff and to pass through the [[transonic]] regime (i.e., "go supersonic") between Mach 0.95 and Mach 1.7, and were switched off at all other times.<ref>{{cite journal |url = http://md1.csa.com/partners/viewrecord.php?requester=gs&collection=TRD&recid=A9110958AH&q=Rolls-Royce%2FSnecma+Olympus+593&uid=788858323&setcookie=yes |title = The Rolls Royce/SNECMA Olympus 593 engine operational experience and the lessons learned |publisher = ''European Symposium on the Future of High Speed Air Transport'' |author =Ganley, G. |coauthors = G.

===Heating issues===
Beside engines, the hottest part of the structure of any supersonic aircraft is the [[nose cone|nose]]. The engineers wanted to use [[duralumin]], an aluminium alloy, throughout the aircraft due to its familiarity, cost and ease of construction. The highest temperature that aluminium could sustain over the life of the aircraft was 127 <U+00B0>C, which limited the top speed to Mach 2.02.<ref>{{cite journal |url = http://www.jstor.org/pss/3951418 |title = When the SST Is Too Slow... |publisher = ''Society for Science & the Public'' |journal =  Science News |first = Jonathan |last = Eberhart |vol = 91 |no = 22 |date = 3 June 1967 |pages = 528<U+2013>529}}</ref>

Concorde went through two cycles of heating and cooling during a flight, first cooling down as it gained altitude, then heating up after going supersonic. The reverse happened when descending and slowing down. This had to be factored into the metallurgical modelling. A test rig was built that repeatedly heated up a full-size section of the wing, and then cooled it, and periodically samples of metal were taken for testing.<ref>{{cite journal |url = http://www.emeraldinsight.com/Insight/viewContentItem.do?contentType=Article&hdAction=lnkpdf&contentId=1681441 |title = The Concorde takes shape : Test programme and construction proceeding according to schedule |publisher = MCB UP |journal = Aircraft Engineering and Aerospace Technology |year = 1966 |volume = 38 |issue = 4 |issn = 0002-2667}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |url = http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1972NASSP.309..631N |title = Fatigue Tests on Big Structure Assemblies of Concorde Aircraft |publisher = ''NASA'' |year = 1972 |author = N'guyen, V.P. |coauthor = J.P. Perrais}}</ref>

Owing to the heat generated by compression of air as Concorde travelled supersonically, the fuselage would extend by as much as 300&nbsp;mm (almost 1&nbsp;ft), the most obvious manifestation of this being a gap that opened up on the flight deck between the [[flight engineer]]<U+2019>s console and the bulkhead. On all Concordes that had a supersonic retirement flight, the flight engineers placed their hats in this gap before it cooled, where the hats remain to this day.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.seattlepi.com/business/147276_pilot07.html |first = James |last = Wallace |title = Those who flew the Concorde will miss it |publisher = Seattle Post |date = 7 November 2003}}</ref>

To keep the cabin cool, Concorde used the fuel as a [[heat sink]] for the heat from the air conditioning,<ref>{{cite journal |url = http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/mcb/127/1993/00000040/00000003/art00002 |title = Introduction to Concorde: A brief review of the Concorde and its prospects |publisher = Emerald Group Publishing Limited |journal = Aircraft Engineering and Aerospace Technology |author =Gedge, G.T.  |coauthor = M.I. Prod |year = 1993 |vol = 40 |no = 3}}</ref> the same method also cooled the hydraulics. During supersonic flight the surfaces forward from the cockpit became heated, a visor was used to deflect much of this heat from directly reaching the cockpit.<ref>{{cite book |page = 14 |first = Kenneth |last = Owen |year = 2001}}</ref>

Concorde also had restrictions on [[aircraft livery|livery]]; the majority of the surface had to be painted with a highly reflecting white paint to avoid overheating the aluminium structure due to the supersonic heating effects of Mach 2.<ref>[http://www.concordesst.com/history/orders.html "Concorde SST: orders."] ''concordesst.com''. Retrieved: 2 December 2009.</ref> In 1996, however, Air France briefly painted F-BTSD in a predominantly-blue livery (with the exception of the wings) as part of a promotional deal with [[Pepsi|Pepsi Cola]].<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-4794332.html |title = Is this the colour of the new millennium? |publisher = ''The Independent'' |date = 3 April 1996}}</ref> In this paint scheme, Air France were advised to remain at Mach 2 for no more than 20 minutes at a time, but there was no restriction at speeds under Mach 1.7. F-BTSD was chosen for the promotion because the aircraft was not then scheduled to operate any long flights that required extended Mach 2 operations.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.elmundo.es/papel/hemeroteca/1996/04/05/comunicacion/100521.html |title = Azul contra rojo |publisher = ''El Mundo'' |first = Cristina |last = Frade |date = 5 April 1996}}</ref>

===Structural issues===
Due to the high speeds at which Concorde travelled, large forces were applied to the aircraft's structure during banks and turns. This caused twisting and the distortion of the aircraft<U+2019>s structure. In addition there were concerns over maintaining precise control at supersonic speeds; both of these issues were resolved by active ratio changes between the inboard and outboard [[elevons]], varying at differing speeds including supersonic. Only the innermost elevons, which are attached to the stiffest area of the wings, are active at high speed.<ref>{{cite book |page = 78 |first = Kenneth |last = Owen |year = 2001}}</ref>

Additionally, the narrow fuselage meant that the aircraft flexed.<ref name="nova" /> This was visible from the rear passengers<U+2019> viewpoints.<ref name="popular">[http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=lpiMSzja6W4C&lpg=PA142&dq=concorde%20flexing&pg=PA118#v=onepage&q=concorde%20flexing&f=false Popular Science Oct 1973]</ref>

===Brakes and undercarriage===
[[File:Concorde undercarriage Speyer 02 with disc brakes.JPG|thumb|Concorde tyres<!--this article uses UK English spellings--> and brakes]]
Due to a high average takeoff speed of {{convert|250|mph|km/h}}, Concorde needed upgraded brakes. Like most airliners, Concorde has [[anti-lock braking system|anti-skid braking]] <U+2013>  a system which prevents the t{{H:title|tires (US) - this article uses UK English spellings|y|link=no}}res from losing traction when the brakes are applied for greater control during roll-out. The brakes, developed by [[Dunlop Rubber|Dunlop]], were the first carbon-based brakes used on an airliner.<ref>{{cite journal |url = http://www.jstor.org/pss/36383 |title = Design and Engineering of Carbon Brakes |publisher = ''The Royal Society'' |author =Stimson, I. L. |coauthors = R. Fisher |date = January 1980 |vol = 294 |no = 1411 |pages = 583<U+2013>590 |journal = Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London}}</ref> They could bring Concorde to a stop from an aborted takeoff within one mile (1600 m) when weighing up to 185 [[ton]]s (188 [[tonnes]]) and travelling at {{convert|190|mph|km/h}}. This braking manoeuvre brought the brakes to temperatures of 300<U+2013>500 <U+00B0>C, requiring several hours for cooling.<ref>[http://www.concordesst.com/gear.html "Concorde SST: Landing Gear."] ''concordesst.com''. Retrieved: 2 December 2009.</ref>

Another issue uncovered during development was the undercarriage. Because of the way Concorde's delta-wing generated lift, the undercarriage had to be unusually strong. At rotation, Concorde would rise to a high angle of attack, about 18 degrees. Prior to rotation the wing generated almost no lift, unlike typical aircraft wings. Combined with the high airspeed at rotation (199 KIAS), this significantly increased the stress on the rear undercarriage and later required a major redesign.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.iasa.com.au/folders/Safety_Issues/others/concordespacer.html |title = The real story of Flight 4590: Special Investigation |publisher = ''iasa.com.au'' |first = David |last = Rose |date = 13 May 2001}}</ref> The rear undercarriages swing towards each other to be stowed but due to their great height also need to retract telescopically before swinging in order to clear each other when stowed.<ref>Brooklands Museum</ref>

===Range===
Concorde needed to travel between London and New York or Washington non-stop, and to achieve this the designers gave Concorde the greatest supersonic range of any aircraft. This was achieved by a combination of careful development of the engines to make them highly efficient at supersonic speeds, by very careful design of the wing shape to give a good [[lift to drag ratio]], by having a modest payload and high fuel capacity, and by moving the fuel to trim the aircraft without introducing any additional drag.<ref name = 'deltawing'/><ref name = 'fueltrim'/><ref name = 'powerplant'/>

Nevertheless, soon after Concorde began flying, a Concorde "B" model was designed with slightly larger fuel capacity and slightly larger wings with [[leading edge slats]] to improve aerodynamic performance at all speeds. It featured more powerful engines with sound deadening and without the fuel-hungry and noisy reheat. It was speculated that it was reasonably possible to create an engine with up to 25% gain in efficiency over the Rolls-Royce/Snecma Olympus 593.<ref>{{cite journal |url = http://md1.csa.com/partners/viewrecord.php?requester=gs&collection=TRD&recid=N9222540AH&q=Concorde+engines&uid=788858323&setcookie=yes |title = Propulsion challenges and opportunities for high-speed transport aircraft |publisher = ''Aeropropulsion'' |author =Strack, William  |year = 1987 |pages = 437<U+2013>452}}</ref> This would have given {{convert|500|mi|0|abbr=on}} additional range even with greater payload, and would have made new commercial routes possible. This was cancelled due in part to poor sales of Concorde, but also to the rising cost of aviation fuel in the 1970s.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://news.google.co.uk/newspapers?id=Q-0cAAAAIBAJ&sjid=rGcEAAAAIBAJ&pg=6914,3256355&dq=tu+144&hl=en |title = Fuel costs kill Second Generation of Concordes |first = Alison |last = Smale |publisher = ''Sarasota Herald-Tribune'' |date = 22 September 1979}}</ref>

===Increased radiation exposure===
[[File:ConcordeFuselageSinsheim.jpg|thumb|Concorde [[fuselage]]]]
The high altitude at which Concorde cruised meant passengers received almost twice the [[flux]] of extraterrestrial [[ionising radiation]] as those travelling on a conventional long-haul flight.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.britishairways.com/travel/healthcosmic/public/en_gb#4 |title = How much radiation might I be exposed to? |publisher = ''British Airways'' |accessdate = 11 January 2010}}</ref><ref name = 'concradi'>{{cite journal |url = http://www.emeraldinsight.com/Insight/viewContentItem.do;jsessionid=E0A02B0587619C9A40D5736FCE7B3F02?contentType=Article&hdAction=lnkpdf&contentId=1682309 |title = Electronic safety test replaces radioactive test source |author= Guerin, D.W.  |journal = Aircraft Engineering and Aerospace Technology |year = 1973 |volume = 45 |issue = 4 |issn = 0002-2667 |publisher = MCB UP}}</ref> Upon Concorde's introduction, it was speculated that this exposure during supersonic travels would increase the likelihood of skin cancer.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://news.google.co.uk/newspapers?id=GfUNAAAAIBAJ&sjid=dnkDAAAAIBAJ&pg=2948,4208&dq=second+generation+concorde&hl=en |title = Skin cancer danger linked to stratospheric jet planes |publisher = ''St. Petersburg Times'' |date = 1 April 1975}}</ref> However, due to the proportionally reduced flight time, the overall [[equivalent dose]] would normally be ''less'' than a conventional flight over the same distance.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.britishairways.com/travel/healthcosmic/public/en_gb |title = Cosmic radiation |publisher = ''British Airways'' |accessdate = 11 January 2010}}</ref> Unusual [[Solar variation|solar activity]] might lead to an increase in incident radiation.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Arctowski |first=Henryk |year=1940 |title=On Solar Faculae and Solar Constant Variations |journal=Proc.

===Cabin pressurisation===
[[File:Concorde interior2.jpg|thumb|right|[[British Airways]] Concorde interior before 2000]]
Airliner cabins were usually pressurised to 6,000<U+2013>8,000&nbsp;feet (1,800<U+2013>2,400 m) elevation while the aircraft flew much higher. Concorde<U+2019>s pressurisation was set to an altitude at the lower end of this range, {{convert|6000|ft|m}}.<ref>{{cite journal |url = http://occmed.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/reprint/17/2/47.pdf |title = Human Factors in the Concorde |journal = Occupational Medicine |last = Hepburn |first = A.N. |volume = 17 |year = 1967 |pages =47<U+2013>51}}</ref> A sudden reduction in cabin pressure is hazardous to all passengers and crew.<ref>{{cite book|title=Flight Training Handbook|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=ioRTAAAAMAAJ|year=1980|accessdate=2007-07-28|publisher=U.S. Dept. of Transportation, [[Federal Aviation Administration]], Flight Standards Service|page=250}}</ref> Concorde<U+2019>s maximum cruising altitude was {{convert|60000|ft|m}}; subsonic airliners typically cruise below {{convert|40000|ft|m}}. Above {{convert|50000|ft|m}}, the lack of air pressure would give a "[[Time of Useful Consciousness|time of useful consciousness]]" in even a conditioned athlete of no more than 10<U+2013>15 seconds.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.theairlinepilots.com/medical/decompressionandhypoxia.htm |title=Cabin Decompression and Hypoxia |first = Mark |last = Wolff |date = 6 January 2006 |publisher = PIA Air Safety Publication}}</ref> A cabin breach could even reduce air pressure to below the ambient pressure outside the aircraft due to the [[Venturi effect]],<ref name="wolfram">{{cite web |url= http://demonstrations.wolfram.com/TheVenturiEffect |title= The Venturi effect |publisher=Wolfram Demonstrations Project |accessdate=3 November 2009}}</ref> as the air is sucked out through an opening. At Concorde<U+2019>s altitude, the air density is very low; a breach of cabin integrity would result in a loss of pressure severe enough so that the plastic emergency oxygen masks installed on other passenger jets would not be effective, and passengers would quickly suffer from [[Hypoxia (medical)|hypoxia]] despite quickly donning them. Concorde, therefore, was equipped with smaller windows to reduce the rate of loss in the event of a breach,<ref name = 'nunn'>{{cite book |title=Nunn's applied respiratory physiology |first = John Francis |last = Nunn |publisher = Butterworth-Heineman |isbn = 075061336X |year = 1993 |page = 341}}</ref> a reserve air supply system to augment cabin air pressure, and a rapid descent procedure to bring the aircraft to a safe altitude.

===Droop nose===
[[File:Heathrow Airport - geograph.org.uk - 293.jpg|thumb|Concorde with drop nose in down position while preparing for takeoff.]]
Concorde<U+2019>s drooping nose was a compromise between the need for a streamlined design to reduce drag and increase aerodynamic efficiency in flight and the need for the pilot to see properly during taxi, takeoff, and landing operations. A delta-wing aircraft takes off and lands with a high angle of attack (a high nose angle) compared to other wing planforms, due to the way the delta wing generates lift. The pointed nose would obstruct the pilots<U+2019> view of taxiways and runways, so Concorde<U+2019>s nose was designed to allow for different positioning for different operations.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://md1.csa.com/partners/viewrecord.php?requester=gs&collection=TRD&recid=A7138343AH&q=Concorde+nose+droop&uid=788872723&setcookie=yes |title = Droop Nose |publisher = ''Flight International'' |year = 1971 |pages = 257<U+2013>260 |author = Goff, W.E.}}</ref> The droop nose was accompanied by a moving visor that was retracted into the nose prior to the nose being lowered. When the nose was raised back to horizontal, the visor was raised ahead of the front cockpit windscreen for aerodynamic streamlining in flight.<ref name = "Concorde nose"/>

A controller in the cockpit allowed the visor to be retracted and the nose to be lowered to 5<U+00B0> below the standard horizontal position for taxiing and [[takeoff]]. Following takeoff and after clearing the airport, the nose and visor were raised. Shortly before landing, the visor was again retracted and the nose lowered to 12.5<U+00B0> below horizontal for maximum visibility. Upon landing, the nose was raised to the five-degree position to avoid the possibility of damage.<ref name = "Concorde nose"/> On rare occasions, the aircraft could take off with the nose fully down.<ref>[http://www.concordesst.com/209.html "Air France fleet: Aircraft no. 209."] ''concordesst.com''.

A final position had the visor retracted into the nose but the nose in the standard horizontal position.

===Flight characteristics===
[[File:Concorde at Baginton - geograph.org.uk - 156846.jpg|thumb|right|Concorde performing a low-level flypast at an air show]]

While commercial jets take eight hours to fly from New York to Paris, the average supersonic flight time on the transatlantic routes was just under 3.5 hours. Concorde had a maximum cruise altitude of {{convert|18,300|m|ft|0|abbr=off}} and an average cruise speed of [[Mach number|Mach]] 2.02, about {{convert|2,140|km/h|mph|0|abbr=off}}, more than twice the speed of conventional aircraft.<ref>{{cite book |page = 64 |first = Richard K |last = Schrader |year = 1989}}</ref> 

With no other civil traffic operating at its cruising altitude of about {{convert|56000|ft|m|abbr=on}}, dedicated [[North Atlantic Tracks|oceanic airways]] or "tracks" were used by Concorde to cross the Atlantic. Due to the nature of high altitude winds, these SST tracks were fixed in terms of their co-ordinates, unlike the [[North Atlantic Tracks]] at lower altitudes whose co-ordinates alter daily according to forecast weather patterns.<ref>{{cite book |page = 84 |first = Orlebar |last = Christopher |year = 2002}}</ref> Concorde would also be cleared in a {{convert|15000|ft|m|sing=on}} block, allowing for a slow climb from 45,000 to {{convert|60000|ft|m|abbr=on}} during the oceanic crossing as the fuel load gradually decreased.<ref>[[Shanwick Oceanic Control|Prestwick Oceanic Area Control Centre]]: Manual of Air Traffic Services (Part 2).

The aircraft, BA<U+2019>s Concorde G-BOAD, was painted in Singapore Airlines livery on the port side and British Airways livery on the [[starboard]] side.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://news.google.co.uk/newspapers?id=3PkQAAAAIBAJ&sjid=hpIDAAAAIBAJ&pg=4864,7521914&dq=concorde+singapore+airlines&hl=en |title = Concorde by June: Offer to Quantas |first = Ross |last = Warneke |publisher = ''The Age'' |date = 25 October 1977}}</ref><ref name = 'singaconc'>{{cite news |url = http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F70611FE3C5E167493C6A8178BD95F438785F9 |title = Singapore Concorde flights |publisher = ''New York Times'' |date = 14 October 1977}}</ref> The service was discontinued after three return flights because of noise complaints from the [[Malaysia]]n government;<ref>{{cite news |url = http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F10F15F6395416768FDDAE0994DA415B878BF1D3 |title = London and Singapore halt Concorde service |publisher = ''New York Times'' |date = 17 December 1977}}</ref> it could only be reinstated on a new route bypassing Malaysian airspace in 1979.

During the [[Mexican oil boom]], Air France flew Concorde twice weekly to Mexico City<U+2019>s [[Benito Ju<U+00E1>rez International Airport]] via [[Washington, DC]], or New York City, from September 1978 to November 1982.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://news.google.co.uk/newspapers?id=uekpAAAAIBAJ&sjid=4tIEAAAAIBAJ&pg=4845,5120670&dq=concorde+mexico&hl=en |title = French Concorde to Mexico City |publisher = ''Daytona Beach Morning Journal'' |date = 11 August 1978}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url = http://news.google.co.uk/newspapers?id=TuwwAAAAIBAJ&sjid=8t8FAAAAIBAJ&pg=3054,6003139&dq=concorde+mexico&hl=en |title = Supersonic Jet flights suspended |publisher = ''Daytona Beach Morning Journal'' |date = 27 September 1982}}</ref> The worldwide economic crisis during that period resulted in this route<U+2019>s cancellation; the last flights were almost empty. The routing between Washington or New York and Mexico City included a deceleration, from Mach 2.02 to Mach 0.95, to cross Florida subsonically and avoid unlawfully creating a sonic boom over the state; Concorde then re-accelerated back to its original speed to cross the Gulf of Mexico. On 1 April 1989, on an around-the-world luxury tour charter, British Airways implemented a new version of this routing that allowed G-BOAF to maintain Mach 2.02 by passing around Florida to the east and south. From time to time, Concorde came back to the region on similar chartered flights to Mexico City and Acapulco.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-5212185.html |title = Air France offering 'New Year's Eve in Paris.' |publisher = PR Newswire |date = 2 October 1987}}</ref>

===BA buys its Concordes outright===
By around 1981 in the UK, the future for Concorde looked bleak. The British government had lost money operating Concorde every year, and moves were afoot to cancel the service entirely. A cost projection came back with greatly reduced metallurgical testing costs, as the test rig for the wings had built up enough data to last for 30 years and could be shut down, but still, having lost money for so many years, the government was not keen to continue. In late 1983, the managing director of BA, [[John King, Baron King of Wartnaby|Sir John King]], convinced the government to sell the aircraft outright to (the then state owned, later privatised) BA for <U+00A3>16.5 million plus the first year<U+2019>s profits.<ref>Backroom boys&nbsp;<U+2014> Francis Spufford</ref><ref name = 'concewhitele'>{{cite web|url=http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/chicagotribune/access/632500842.html?dids=632500842:632500842&FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:AI&type=historic&date=Apr+01%2C+1984&author=&pub=Chicago+Tribune&desc=The+plane+fact+is%2C+Concorde+has+broken+the+profit+barrier+for+the+first+time&pqatl=google |title = The plane fact is, Concorde has broken the profit barrier for the first time |publisher=''Chicago Tribune'' |date=1 April 1984 |first = Peter |last = Greenberg}}</ref>

Sir John King realised that he had a premier product that was underpriced, and after carrying out a market survey, British Airways discovered that their target customers thought that Concorde was more expensive than it actually was.

===Concorde Flight 4590 crash===
{{Main|Air France Flight 4590}}
On 25 July 2000, Air France Flight 4590, registration F-BTSC, crashed in [[Gonesse]], France, killing all 100 passengers and nine crew on board the flight, and four people on the ground. It was the only fatal incident involving Concorde.

According to the official investigation conducted by the French accident investigation bureau (BEA), the crash was caused by a [[titanium]] strip that fell from a [[Continental Airlines]] [[McDonnell Douglas DC-10-30|DC-10]] that had taken off minutes earlier. This metal fragment punctured a [[tire|tyre]] on the Concorde's left main wheel bogie during takeoff.<!-- please leave British spelling of "tyres" on British/French aircraft ---> The tyre exploded, and a piece of rubber hit the fuel tank. This impact caused a major fuel leak from the tank, which then ignited due to severed, sparking electrical wiring. The crew shut down engine number 2 in response to a fire warning, and with engine number 1 surging and producing little power, the aircraft was unable to gain height or speed. The aircraft entered a rapid pitch-up then a violent descent, rolling left and crashing tail-low into the Hotelissimo Hotel in Gonesse.<ref>Endres 2001, pp. 110<U+2013>113.</ref>

Prior to the accident, Concorde had been arguably the safest operational passenger airliner in the world in terms of passenger deaths-per-kilometres travelled with zero, but with a history of tyre explosions 60 times higher than subsonic jets.<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0UBT/is_6_16/ai_82753359/ |accessdate=1 February 2010 |title=Human Factor Issues Emerge from Concorde Crash Investigation |journal=Air Safety Week}}</ref> Safety improvements were made in the wake of the crash, including more secure electrical controls, [[Kevlar]] lining to the fuel tanks and specially-developed burst-resistant tyres.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/1442061.stm |title = Concorde's safety modifications |publisher = ''BBC News'' |date = 17 July 2001}}</ref>

The first flight after the modifications departed from [[London Heathrow airport|London Heathrow]] on 17 July 2001, piloted by BA Chief Concorde Pilot [[Mike Bannister]]. During the 3-hour 20-minute flight over the mid-Atlantic towards Iceland, Bannister attained [[Mach number|Mach]] 2.02 and {{convert|60000|ft|m|abbr=on}} before returning to [[RAF Brize Norton]]. The test flight, intended to resemble the London<U+2013>New York route, was declared a success and was watched on live TV, and by crowds on the ground at both locations.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,29732,00.html |title = Concorde Completes Successful Test Flight |publisher = ''Fox News'' |date = 17 July 2001}}</ref> Another BA assessment flight carrying passengers took place on 11 September 2001, and was in the air during the [[11 September 2001 attacks]] in the United States.

On 22 October, Heathrow ATC arranged for the inbound flight BA9021C, a special from Manchester, and BA002 from New York to land simultaneously on the left and right runways respectively. On the evening of 23 October 2003, [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|the Queen]] consented to the illumination of [[Windsor Castle]] as Concorde's last west-bound commercial flight departed London overhead, an honour normally reserved for major state events and visiting dignitaries.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.rockawave.com/news/2003-10-31/Front_Page/028.html |title = The Concorde Makes A Comeback |first = Brian |last = Magoolaghan |publisher = Wave of Long Island |date = 31 October 2003}}</ref>

The three aircraft then circled over London, having received special permission to fly at low altitude, before landing in sequence at Heathrow. All three aircraft spent 45&nbsp;minutes taxiing around the airport before disembarking the last supersonic fare-paying passengers.

===Restoration===
A group of French volunteer engineers is keeping one of the youngest Concordes (F-BTSD) in near-airworthy condition at the Le Bourget Air and Space Museum in Paris. In February 2010, it was announced that they intend to restore F-BTSD's engines so it can taxi.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.flightglobal.com/articles/2010/02/05/338114/air-france-concorde-to-taxi-again-under-own-power.html |title=Air France Concorde to taxi again under own power |publisher=Flightglobal |date=5 February 2010 |accessdate=5 February 2010}}</ref>

Although only used for spares after being retired from test flying and trials work in 1981, Concorde G-BBDG was dismantled and transported by road from [[Filton]] then restored from essentially a shell at the [[Brooklands Museum]] in [[Surrey]].<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.concordeproject.com/ |title = The Brooklands Concorde Project |publisher = ''Brooklands Museum'' |accessdate = 15 January 2010}}</ref>

==Impact==
===Environmental===
Prior to Concorde<U+2019>s flight trials, the developments made by the civil aviation industry were largely accepted by governments and their respective electorates. However, the opposition to Concorde<U+2019>s noise, particularly on the eastern coast of the United States,<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,918012,00.html |title = Here Comes the Concorde, Maybe |publisher = ''Time'' |date = 16 February 1976}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |url = http://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?collection=journals&handle=hein.journals/jalc42&div=28&id=&page= |title = Legal and Environmental ramifications of the Concorde |first = Robert M. |last = Allen |publisher = ''J.

Kennedy International Airport|John F Kennedy Airport]], many found that Concorde was actually quieter than expected,<ref name=nova/> partly due to the pilots temporarily throttling back their engines to reduce noise during overflight of residential areas.<ref>Endres 2001, p 90.</ref> Even before the launch of revenue earning services, it had been noted that Concorde was actually quieter than several aircraft already commonly in service at that time.<ref>{{cite journal |url = http://www.emeraldinsight.com/Insight/viewContentItem.do?contentType=Article&hdAction=lnkpdf&contentId=1682311 |title = Reducing noise with type 28 nozzle |journal = Aircraft Engineering and Aerospace Technology |year = 1973 |volume = 45 |issue = 4 |publisher = MCB UP}}</ref>

{{supersonic fuel efficiency}}
Concorde produced nitrogen oxides in its exhaust, which, despite complicated chemical interactions with other ozone-depleting chemicals, are understood to produce a net degradation to the [[ozone layer]] at the [[stratosphere|stratospheric]] altitudes it cruised.<ref name = 'emissions'>{{cite journal |url = http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/sci;270/5233/70 |title = Emission Measurements of the Concorde Supersonic Aircraft in the Lower Stratosphere |author =Fahey, D. W. |coauthors =et al. |journal = Science |year = 1995 |volume = 270 |no = 5233}}</ref> It has been pointed out that other, lower-flying, airliners produce ozone during their flights in the troposphere, but vertical transit of gases between the two is highly restricted. The small fleet size meant that any net ozone-layer degradation caused by Concorde was for all practical purposes negligible.<ref name = 'emissions'/>

Concorde<U+2019>s technical leap forward boosted the public<U+2019>s understanding of conflicts between technology and the environment as well as the awareness of the complex decision analysis processes that surround such conflicts.<ref>{{cite journal |url = http://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?collection=journals&handle=hein.journals/cjel5&div=9&id=&page= |title = Decision Analysis in Environmental Decisionmaking: Improving the Concorde Balance |first = Jon |last = Anderson |publisher = HeinOnline |year = 1978}}</ref> In France, the use of [[noise barrier|acoustic fencing]] alongside [[TGV]] tracks might not have been achieved without the 1970s controversy over aircraft noise.<ref>{{cite web |publisher = ''Environmental Science and Engineering'' |date = November 2001 |url = http://www.esemag.com/1101/1101ed.html |title = Train <U+00E0> grande vitesse causes distress}}</ref> In the UK, the [[CPRE]] have issued [[tranquillity]] maps since 1990.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.cpre.org.uk/campaigns/landscape/tranquillity/national-and-regional-tranquillity-maps |title = National and regional tranquillity maps |publisher = Campaign to Protect Rural England |accessdate = 25 April 2010}}</ref>

===Public perception===
[[File:ConcordeBG.jpg|thumb|right|Parade flight at Queen<U+2019>s [[Golden Jubilee of Elizabeth II|Golden Jubilee]]]]
Concorde was normally perceived as a privilege of the rich, but special circular or one-way (with return by coach or ship) charter flights were arranged to bring a trip within the means of moderately well-off enthusiasts.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.alacrastore.com/storecontent/Business-and-Industry/24962872 |title = British Airways Concorde is expected to begin flying passengers again in next 6 weeks |publisher = Dallas Morning News |date = 23 August 2001}}</ref> It is a symbol of great national pride to many in the UK and France; in France it was thought of as a French aircraft, in the UK as British.<ref name = 'rus144'/>

The aircraft was usually referred to by the British as simply "Concorde",<ref>{{cite news |url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/in_depth/uk/2003/concorde_retirement/default.stm |title = Farewell to Concorde |publisher = ''BBC News'' |accessdate = 15 January 2010 | date=15 August 2007}}</ref> whilst in France it was known as "le Concorde" due to "le", the definite article,<ref name="OxLangFrGlos">[http://www.oxfordlanguagedictionaries.com/Public/PublicResources.html?direction=b-fr-en&sp=S/oldo/resources/fr/French-supp-05.xml Oxford Language Dictionaries Online - French Resources]: Glossary of Grammatical Terms</ref> being used in [[French grammar]] to distinguish a [[proper name]]<ref name="OxLangFrGlos"/> from a [[common noun]] of the same spelling.<ref>[http://www.cnrtl.fr/lexicographie/academie9/le Centre National de Ressources Textuelle et Lexicalles] - D<U+00E9>finition de LE, LA: article d<U+00E9>fini</ref><ref>[http://grammaire.reverso.net/5_2_01_la_majuscule_dans_les_noms_propres.shtml Reverso Dictionnaire: La majuscule dans les noms propres] ("Capital letters within proper names")</ref> In French, the common noun ''concorde'' means "agreement, harmony, or peace",<ref>Ferrar 1980, p 114. '''concorde''' ''s.f.'' concord, unity, harmony, peace.</ref> and the aircraft<U+2019>s name was almost certainly chosen for its allusion to the collaboration between the British and French governments. Concorde<U+2019>s pilots and British Airways in official publications and videos often refer to Concorde both in the singular and plural as "she" or "her".<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.britishairways.com/travel/concvidhome/public/en_gb |title = Celebrate Concorde: videos |publisher = ''British Airways'' |accessdate = 15 January 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ro3QVMCG-aY |title = Documentry of British Airways Concorde introduction |publisher = ''youtube.com'' |quote = [[Raymond Baxter]] commentating as Concorde flies for first time: "She rolls ...

The desire for a second-generation supersonic aircraft has remained within some elements of the aviation industry,<ref>{{cite web |url = http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=NewsLibrary&p_multi=APAB&d_place=APAB&p_theme=newslibrary2&p_action=search&p_maxdocs=200&p_topdoc=1&p_text_direct-0=0F89C550A53D43FD&p_field_direct-0=document_id&p_perpage=10&p_sort=YMD_date:D&s_trackval=GooglePM |title = French transport chief speculates about new-generation Concorde |publisher = ''Associated Press'' |date = 17 August 2000}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url = http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/washingtonpost/access/72587838.html?dids=72587838:72587838&FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT&type=current&date=May+10%2C+1990&author=Edward+Cody&pub=The+Washington+Post+(pre-1997+Fulltext)&desc=Partnership+Gears+Up+For+Concorde+Sequel%3B+British%2C+French+Firms+Sign+Plane+Pact&pqatl=google |title = Partnership gears up for Concorde sequel; British, French firms sign plane pact |publisher = ''Washington Post'' |first = Edward |last = Cody |date = 10 May 1990}}</ref> and several concepts have emerged quickly following the retirement of Concorde.

In November 2003, [[EADS]]<U+2014>the parent company of the [[Airbus]] aircraft manufacturing company<U+2014>announced that it was considering working with Japanese companies to develop a larger, faster replacement for Concorde.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/3231354.stm |title = Firm considers 'son of Concorde' |publisher = ''BBC News'' |date = 23 November 2003}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/8229113/ |title = Japan, France working on new supersonic jet |publisher = ''MSNBC'' |date = 15 June 2005}}</ref>  In October 2005, [[Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency|JAXA]], the Japan Aerospace eXploration Agency, undertook aerodynamic testing of a scale model of an airliner designed to carry 300 passengers at Mach 2 (working name ''[[NEXST]]''). If pursued to commercial deployment, it would be expected to be in service around 2020<U+2013>2025.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/4325634.stm |title = Japan tests supersonic jet model |publisher = ''BBC News'' |date = 10 October 2005}}</ref>

The British company [[Reaction Engines Limited]], with 50% EU money, are engaged in a research programme called ''[[LAPCAT]]'', which is examining a design for a hydrogen-fuelled plane carrying 300 passengers called the ''[[Reaction Engines A2|A2]]'', capable of flying at Mach 5+ non-stop from Brussels to Sydney in 4.6 hours.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gizmowatch.com/entry/lapcat-aims-at-supersonic-civil-aviation/ |title=LAPCAT aims at supersonic civil aviation |date=30 August 2007 |author= |publisher= ''Gizmo Watch'' |accessdate= 3 July 2009}}</ref>

In May 2008, it was reported that [[Aerion]] Corporation had $3 billion of pre-order sales on its [[Aerion SBJ]] supersonic business jet.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://business.timesonline.co.uk/tol/business/industry_sectors/transport/article3953823.ece |title = Orders for Aerion's Concorde executive jet are more than $3 billion |publisher = ''The Times'' |first = Dominic |last = O'Connell |date = 18 May 2008 | location=London}}</ref>

[[Supersonic Aerospace International]]'s [[SAI Quiet Supersonic Transport|Quiet Supersonic Transport]] has a cruising speed of Mach 1.6. Designed by [[Lockheed Martin]], it would create a sonic boom only 1% as strong as that generated by Concorde.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.cnn.com/2007/TECH/02/16/quiet.supersonic/index.html |publisher = CNN |title = Supersonic jet promises to fly nearly silent |date = 16 February 2007 |first = Eric |last = Hagerman}}</ref> 

Research into [[supersonic business jet]]s continues, as of 2009.
