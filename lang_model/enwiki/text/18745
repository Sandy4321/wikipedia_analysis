'''John F. Stossel''' (born March 6, 1947) is an American consumer [[reporter]], [[Investigative journalism|investigative journalist]], author and [[Libertarianism|libertarian]] columnist. In October 2009, Stossel left his long-time home on [[ABC News]] to join the [[Fox Business Channel]] and [[Fox News Channel]]. He hosts a weekly news show on Fox Business, ''[[Stossel (TV series)|Stossel]]'', which debuted on December 10, 2009. The show airs in prime time every Thursday, repeating on both Saturdays and Sundays. Stossel also regularly provides analysis, appearing on various [[Fox News Channel|Fox News]] shows, including weekly appearances on ''[[The O'Reilly Factor]]'', in addition to writing the Fox News Blog, "John Stossel's Take". Since February 2011, Stossel has also become a nationally syndicated newspaper columnist.

Stossel's reporting style, which is a blend of commentary and reporting, reflects a libertarian political philosophy and his views on economics are largely supportive of the [[free market]].<ref>Johnson, Carlisle (January 15, 2008). [http://www.newmedia.ufm.edu/stossselinterview "Interview with John Stossel by Carlisle Johnson"]. [[Francisco Marroquin University]] (Guatemala)</ref>

In his decades as a reporter, Stossel has received numerous honors and awards, including 19 [[Emmy Awards]] and has been honored five times for excellence in consumer reporting by the [[National Press Club (USA)|National Press Club]].<ref name=google/> John Stossel is doctor ''honoris causa'' from [[Universidad Francisco Marroqu<U+00ED>n]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newmedia.ufm.edu/gsm/index.php?title=Doctorado_Honor%C3%ADfico_a_John_Stossel |title=Doctorado Honor<U+00ED>fico a John Stossel |language={{es icon}} |publisher=New Media UFM|accessdate=May 29, 2011}}</ref> Stossel has written two books recounting how his experiences in journalism shaped his socioeconomic views, ''Give Me a Break'' in 2004 and ''Myths, Lies, and Downright Stupidity'' in 2007.

Stossel began his journalism career as a researcher for [[KGW-TV]] and later became a consumer reporter at [[WCBS-TV]] in New York City, before joining ABC News as a consumer editor and reporter on ''[[Good Morning America]]''. Stossel went on to be an [[ABC News]] [[news correspondent|correspondent]], joining the weekly news magazine program ''[[20/20 (US television series)|20/20]]'', going on to become [[news presenter|co-anchor]].<ref>{{cite news| url=http://abcnews.go.com/2020/Stossel/story?id=124326&page=1|title=Excerpt: John Stossel's 'Give Me a Break'|publisher=[[ABC News]]|date=February 27, 2007|first=John|last=Stossel|accessdate=April 13, 2007}}</ref> 

ABC is reported to believe "his reporting goes against the grain of the established media and offers the network something fresh and different...[but] makes him a target of the groups he offends."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://query.nytimes.comgst/fullpage.html?res=9804E3DA133FF937A2575BC0A9669C8B63

==Early life==
John F. Stossel was born on March 6, 1947,<ref name=TVGuide>{{cite newspaper|url=http://www.tvguide.com/celebrities/john-stossel/bio/212342|title=John Stossel: Biography|newspaper=[[TV Guide]]|accessdate=August 12, 2012}}</ref> in [[Chicago Heights, Illinois]], the younger of two sons,<ref name=GimmeABreak>Stossel, John (2004).

They joined a Congregationalist church in the U.S., and Stossel was raised Protestant.<ref name=Blaze>Hallowell, Billy (December 13, 2012).

''[[Sun-Sentinel]]''.</ref> He grew up on [[Chicago]]'s affluent [[North Shore (Chicago)|North Shore]] and graduated from [[New Trier High School]].<ref>Zwecker, Bill (February 23, 2011).

''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]''.</ref> Stossel characterizes his older brother, Tom, as "the superstar of the family", commenting, "While I partied and played poker, he studied hard, got top grades, and went to Harvard Medical School." Stossel characterizes himself has having been "an indifferent student" while in college, commenting, "I daydreamed through half my classes at Princeton, and applied to grad school only because I was ambitious, and grad school seemed like the right path for a 21-year-old who wanted to get ahead." Although he had been accepted to the [[University of Chicago]]'s School of Hospital Management, Stossel was "sick of school" and thought taking a job would inspire him to embrace graduate studies with renewed vigor.<ref name=GimmeABreak/>

==Career==
===Early career===
Stossel intended to go work at ''Seattle Magazine'', but it had gone out of business by the time he graduated. His contacts there, however, got him a job at [[KGW-TV]] in [[Portland, Oregon]], where Stossel began as a newsroom gofer, working his way up to researcher and then writer. After a few years, the news director told Stossel to go on the air and read what he wrote. Stossel, who confesses to having been frightened of being on the air, has expressed embarrassment at watching videos of his early performances. Nonetheless, Stossel says his fear spurred him to improve, examining broadcasts of [[David Brinkley]] and [[Jack Perkins (reporter)|Jack Perkins]] to imitate them. Stossel also struggled with a [[stuttering]] problem he had harbored since childhood. After a few years of on-air reporting, Stossel was hired by [[WCBS-TV]] in New York City, by Ed Joyce, the same news director who hired [[Arnold Diaz]], [[Linda Ellerbee]], [[Dave Marash]], [[Joel Siegel]] and [[Lynn Sherr]]. Stossel was disappointed at CBS, feeling that the journalism was of a lower quality than in Portland, and disliking the lower amount of time devoted to research done there. Stossel cites union work rules that discouraged the extra work that Stossel felt allowed employees to be creative, which he says represented his "first real introduction to the deals made by special interests". Stossel also "hated" Joyce, who he felt was "cold and critical", though Stossel credits Joyce with allowing him the freedom to pursue his own story ideas, and with recommending a clinic in [[Roanoke, Virginia]] that largely cured Stossel's stuttering problem.<ref name=GimmeBreak3-8>Stossel. 2004. pp. 3 <U+2013> 8</ref>

Stossel grew continuously more frustrated with having to follow the assignment editor's vision of what was news. Perhaps because of his stuttering, he had always avoided covering what others covered, feeling he could not succeed if he was forced to compete with other reporters by shouting out questions at news conferences. However, this led to the unexpected realization for Stossel that more important events were those that occurred slowly, such as the [[Feminist movement|women's movement]], the growth of computer technology, and advancements in [[contraception]], rather than daily events like government pronouncements, elections, fires or crime. One day, Stossel bypassed the assignment editor to give Ed Joyce a list of story ideas the assignment editor had rejected. Joyce agreed that Stossel's ideas were better, and approved them.<ref name=GimmeBreak3-8/>
===''20/20''===
In 1981 [[Roone Arledge]] offered Stossel a job at [[ABC News]], as a [[news correspondent|correspondent]] for ''[[20/20 (US television series)|20/20]]'' and consumer reporter for ''[[Good Morning America]]''.<ref>Stossel. 2004. pp. 10 <U+2013> 11</ref> His "Give Me a Break" segments for the former featured a [[Skepticism#Scientific skepticism|skeptical]] look at subjects from [[government regulation]]s and [[pop culture]] to censorship and unfounded fear. The series was [[spinoff (television)|spun off]] into a series of one-hour specials with budgets of half a million dollars<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QXGergmtf4 |title=John Stossel: The Reason.tv interview (Part 1 of 2)|publisher=[[YouTube]]|date=February 3, 2009 |accessdate=April 28, 2012}}</ref> that began in 1994.

===Fox News Channel and Fox Business Network===
In September 2009, it was announced that Stossel was leaving [[Disney]]'s ABC News and joining [[News Corp.]]'s [[Fox News Channel]] and [[Fox Business Network]]. In addition to appearing on ''[[The O'Reilly Factor]]'' every Tuesday night, he now hosts a one-hour weekly program for Fox Business Network and a series of one-hour specials for Fox News Channel, as well as making regular guest appearances on Fox News programs.

The program, entitled ''[[Stossel (TV series)|Stossel]]'', debuted December 10, 2009, on Fox Business Network.<ref>{{cite web |url =http://m.foxbusiness.com/quickPage.html?page=26798 |title =John Stossel |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6H1t4MvgW |archivedate=May 31, 2013 |publisher =Fox Business Network |accessdate=May 31, 2013 }}</ref> The program looks at consumer-focused topics, such as [[civil liberties]], the business of health care, and [[free trade]].

===Publications===
{{see also|No, They Can't}}
Stossel has written three books. ''Give Me a Break: How I Exposed Hucksters, Cheats, and Scam Artists and Became the Scourge of the Liberal Media'' is a 2005 autobiography from Harper Perennial documenting his career and philosophical transition from [[Modern liberalism in America|liberalism]] to libertarianism. It describes his opposition to government regulation, his belief in [[free market]] and private enterprise, support for [[tort reform]], and advocacy for shifting social services from the government to private charities. It was a [[New York Times bestseller]] for 11 weeks.<ref name=TownhallBio>{{cite web| url=http://www.townhall.com/Columnists/JohnStossel/ | title=Columns by John Stossel | publisher=Townhall.com | accessdate=September 24, 2007}}</ref> ''Myths, Lies, and Downright Stupidity: Get Out the Shovel <U+2013> Why Everything You Know Is Wrong'', which was published in 2007 by Hyperion, questions the validity of various [[conventional wisdom]]s, and argues that the belief he is [[Conservatism in the United States|conservative]] is untrue. On April 10, 2012, Threshold Editions, an imprint of [[Simon & Schuster]], published Stossel's third book ''No, They Can't: Why Government Fails <U+2013> But Individuals Succeed''. It argues that government policies meant to solve problems instead produce new ones, and that free individuals and the private sector perform tasks more efficiently than the government does.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.heritage.org/events/2012/04/no-they-cant | title=No They Can't: Why Government Fails <U+2013> But Individuals Succeed | publisher=[[Heritage Foundation]] | date=April 11, 2012 | accessdate=April 17, 2012 | author=Gonzalez, Mike}}</ref>

With financial support from the libertarian [[Palmer R. Chitester Fund]], Stossel and ABC News launched a series of educational materials for public schools in 1999 entitled "Stossel in the Classroom".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://stosselintheclassroom.org/ |title=Stossel in the Classroom |publisher="Stossel in the Classroom" |accessdate=April 28, 2012}}; and, {{cite news| url=http://www.mediatransparency.org/reprints/brill_stossel.htm | title=Laissez-Faire TV | publisher=Media Transparency | last=Rose |first=Ted |date=2000<U+2013>03 | accessdate=September 24, 2007}}</ref> It was taken over in 2006 by the Center for Independent Thought and releases a new DVD of teaching materials annually. In 2006, Stossel and ABC released ''Teaching Tools for Economics'', a video series based on the National Council of Economics Education standards.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://abcnews.go.com/2020/Stossel/story?id=1936941 | title=Teaching Tools for Economics from John Stossel | publisher=ABC News| date=April 29, 2007 | accessdate=September 24, 2007}}</ref>

Since February 2011, Stossel has written a weekly newspaper column for [[Creators Syndicate]].<ref name=AboutJohnStossel>[http://www.creators.com/opinion/john-stossel-about.html "About John Stossel"].

===Charity and other work===
Stossel often makes public appearances and speeches, advocating his brand of libertarian thought.<ref>Whitney, Kyle (2008-03-20) [http://media.www.thenorthwindonline.com/media/storage/paper1202/news/2008/03/20/News/Abc-Anchor.Speaks.On.Americans.Rights-3277195.shtml "ABC Anchor speaks on Americans' rights"], The North Wind online</ref> Stossel explained at the end of the December 30, 2010 episode of ''[[Stossel (TV series)|Stossel]]'' that he gives away his earnings from these engagements to charity; they contribute 25% of his income. The three main groups he supports with his donations are the [[The Doe Fund]], the [[Central Park]] Conservancy (on whose board he sits), and [[Student Sponsor Partners]] (SSP), which partners low-income high school students with donors who mentor the students and pay tuition for the students to attend private school (usually Catholic schools), which Stossel says have higher graduation rates than public schools.<ref>''Stossel'', [[Fox Business Channel]], December 30, 2010</ref>

Stossel and his former [[ABC News]] colleague [[Chris Cuomo]] are silent investors in Columbus Tavern, a restaurant on Columbus Avenue at 72nd Street on Manhattan's [[Upper West Side]].<ref>"Who Keeps the Lights On?", ''Stossel'', Episode 2.20, May 12, 2011; and, [http://myupperwest.com/upper-west-side/newlyopened-columbus-tavern-media-hangout/ "Newly-Opened Columbus Tavern Becomes Media Hangout"], My Upper West, March 4, 2011</ref>

==Political and personal beliefs==
===Contrarianism===
Stossel's news reports and writings attempt to debunk popular beliefs. His ''Myths and Lies'' series of ''[[20/20 (US television series)|20/20]]'' specials challenges a range of widely held beliefs. He also hosted ''[[The Power of Belief (TV)|The Power of Belief]]'' (October 6, 1998), an ABC News Special that focused on assertions of the paranormal and people's desire to believe. Another report outlined the belief that opposition to [[DDT]] is misplaced and that the ban on DDT has resulted in the deaths of millions of children,<ref name="DDTban">{{cite web | url=http://www.acsh.org/healthissues/newsID.442/healthissue_detail.asp | title=The DDT Ban Turns 30 <U+2013> Millions Dead of Malaria Because of Ban, More Deaths Likely | publisher=American Council on Science and Health | date=June 1, 2002 | accessdate=November 17, 2007 | last=Seavey | first=Todd }}</ref> mostly in poor nations.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2006/10/hooray_for_ddts_lifesaving_com.html | title=Hooray for DDT's Life-Saving Comeback | publisher=Real Clear Politics | date=October 4, 2006 | last=Stossel | first=John | accessdate=September 24, 2007}}</ref>

===Libertarianism===
[[File:J Stossel at NHLF.jpg|thumb|right|Stossel speaking at the [[Free State Project]]'s [[New Hampshire Liberty Forum]].]]
As a [[Libertarianism|libertarian]], Stossel says that he believes in both [[Cultural liberalism|personal freedom]]<ref>"[http://www.newmedia.ufm.edu/stossel Conference about ''The Myths, Lies and Downright Stupidity'']" at Francisco Marroquin University. Guatemala, January 2008</ref> and the [[free market]]. He frequently uses television airtime to advance these views and challenge viewers' distrust of [[free-market capitalism]] and [[Competition (economics)|economic competition]]. He received an Honoris Causa Doctorate from [[Francisco Marroquin University]], a libertarian university in [[Guatemala]], in 2008. He told ''[[The Oregonian]]'', on October 26, 1994:

{{quote|I started out by viewing the marketplace as a cruel place, where you need intervention by government and lawyers to protect people. But after watching the regulators work, I have come to believe that markets are magical and the best protectors of the consumer. It is my job to explain the beauties of the free market.<ref>''[[The Oregonian]]'', 26 October 1994</ref>}}

{{quote|I'm a little embarrassed about how long it took me to see the folly of most government intervention. It was probably 15 years before I really woke up to the fact that almost everything government attempts to do, it makes worse.<ref name="Sigall"/>}}

Stossel argues that individual self-interest, or "greed", creates an incentive to work harder and to innovate.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.townhall.com/columnists/JohnStossel/2006/04/26/greed_is_good |title=Greed is good | last=Stossel | first=John | publisher=Townhall.com | date=April 26, 2006 | accessdate=September 24, 2007}}</ref> He has promoted [[school choice]] as a way to improve American schools, believing that when people are given a choice, they will choose the schools best suited for their children.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.townhall.com/columnists/JohnStossel/2006/08/30/schools_need_competition_now |title=Schools need competition now | publisher=Townhall.com | last=Stossel | first=John | date=August 30, 2006 | accessdate=September 24, 2007}}</ref> Referring to educational tests that rank American students lower than others he says:

{{quote|The people who run the international tests told us, "the biggest predictor of student success is choice." Nations that "attach the money to the kids" and thereby allow parents to choose between different public and private schools have higher test scores. This should be no surprise; competition makes us better.<ref name="smearchoice">{{cite news|url=http://www.townhall.com/columnists/JohnStossel/2006/07/26/smearing_education_choice |title=Smearing Education Choice | publisher=Townhall.com | last=Stossel | first=John | date=2006-07-26 | accessdate=2007-09-24}}</ref>}}

Stossel has criticized government programs for being inefficient, wasteful, and harmful.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.townhall.com/columnists/JohnStossel/2006/08/16/does_government_stupidity_know_any_bounds | title=Does Government Stupidity Know Any Bounds|publisher=Townhall.com|last=Stossel|first=John|date=August 16, 2006| accessdate=September 24, 2007}}</ref> He has also criticized the American legal system, opining that it provides lawyers and vexatious litigators the incentive to file frivolous lawsuits indiscriminately. Stossel contends that these suits often generate more wealth for lawyers than for deserving clients, stifle innovation and personal freedoms, and cause harm to private citizens, taxpayers, consumers and businesses.<ref>Stossel, 2004. "The Trouble with Lawyers". pp. 177 <U+2013> 179)</ref> Although Stossel concedes that some lawsuits are necessary in order to provide justice to people genuinely injured by others with greater economic power,<ref>Martel, Frances.[http://www.mediaite.com/tv/john-stossel-fights-frivolous-lawsuits-on-a-go-cart/ "John Stossel Fights Frivolous Lawsuits On A Go-Cart"].

===Praise===
The Nobel Prize<U+2013>winning [[Chicago school of economics|Chicago School]] [[Monetarism|monetarist]] economist [[Milton Friedman]] lauded Stossel, stating: "Stossel is that rare creature, a TV commentator who understands economics, in all its subtlety."<ref name="media maverick">{{cite news|url=http://www.independent.org/events/detail.asp?eventID=92|title=Confessions of a Media Maverick: Exposing Hucksters, Cheats and Scam Artists|publisher=The Independent Institute Conference Center|date=January 30, 2004|accessdate=September 24, 2007}}</ref> [[Steve Forbes]], the editor of ''[[Forbes Magazine]]'', described Stossel as riveting and "one of America<U+2019>s ablest and most courageous journalists."<ref name="media maverick" /> [[P.

An article published by the libertarian group [[Advocates for Self Government]] notes praise for Stossel.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theadvocates.org/celebrities/john-stossel.html|title=John Stossel <U+2013> Libertarian|publisher=Advocates for Self-Government|accessdate=July 10, 2007|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070702172434/http://www.theadvocates.org/celebrities/john-stossel.html|archivedate=July 2, 2007}}</ref> Independent Institute Research Analyst Anthony Gregory, writing on the libertarian blog, [[LewRockwell.com]], described Stossel as a "heroic rogue... a media maverick and proponent of freedom in an otherwise [[Statism|statist]], conformist mass media."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.lewrockwell.com/gregory/gregory55.html|title=Real TV News|publisher=LewRockwell.com|last=Gregory|first=Anthony|date=January 11, 2005|accessdate=September 24, 2007}}</ref> Libertarian investment analyst [[Mark Skousen]] said Stossel is "a true libertarian hero".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.markskousen.com/article.php?id=1141|title=A Year at FEE|publisher=Forecasts & Strategies|last=Skousen|first=Mark|date=February 1, 2003|accessdate=September 24, 2007}}</ref>

===Criticism and controversy===
====Watchdog groups====
Progressive organizations such as [[Fairness and Accuracy In Reporting]] (FAIR) and [[Media Matters for America]] (MMfA)<ref>[http://fair.org/about-fair/ "What's FAIR?"]. FAIR. Retrieved March 20, 2013.</ref><ref>[http://mediamatters.org/p/about_us/ "About Us"]. Media Matters for America.

For example, Stossel was criticized for a segment on his October 11, 1999 show during which he argued that AIDS research has received too much funding, "25 times more than on Parkinson's, which kills more people." FAIR responded that AIDS had killed more people in the United States in 1999.<ref>Hart, Peter (March 1, 2003). [http://fair.org/extra-online-articles/give-us-a-break/ "Give Us a Break: The World According to John Stossel"]. Extra!, FAIR.</ref>

====Accusation of conflict of interest====
In a February 2000 [[Salon.com]] feature on Stossel entitled "Prime-time propagandist", David Mastio wrote that Stossel has a conflict of interest in donating profits from his public speaking engagements to, among others, a non-profit called "Stossel in the Classroom" which includes material for use in schools, some of which uses material made by Stossel.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.salon.com/2000/02/25/stossel/ | title=Prime-time propagandist | date=February 25, 2000 | last=Mastio | first=David | publisher=Salon Media | accessdate=October 6, 2007}}; and, {{cite news | url=http://www.thenation.com/doc/20020107/dowie/3 | title=A Teflon Correspondent | last=Dowie | first=Mark | date=December 20, 2001 | accessdate=October 6, 2007 | publisher=The Nation}}</ref>

====Galbraith and Stossel====
[[University of Texas]] economist [[James K. Galbraith]] has alleged that Stossel, in his September 1999 special ''Is America #1?'', used an out-of-context clip of Galbraith to convey the notion that Galbraith advocated the adoption by Europe of the free market economics practiced by the United States, when in fact Galbraith actually advocated that Europe adopt some of the United States' social benefit transfer mechanisms such as [[Social security|Social Security]], which is the economically opposite view. Stossel denied any misrepresentation of Galbraith's views and stated that it was not his intention to convey that Galbraith agreed with all of the special's ideas. However, he re-edited that portion of the program for its September 2000 repeat, in which Stossel paraphrased, "Even economists who like Europe's policies, like James Galbraith, now acknowledge America's success."<ref name="treatment">{{cite web|url=http://www.fair.org/index.php?page=1134 | title=The Stossel Treatment | publisher=Fairness and Accuracy In Reporting | first=Rachel | last=Coen | date=2003-03 | accessdate=November 14, 2007}}</ref><ref>Rose, Ted (March 2000) [http://www.mediatransparency.org/reprints/brill_stossel.htm "Laissez-Faire TV: ABC's John Stossel is a man on a mission to teach Americans about the evils of government regulation and the rewards of free enterprise."] ''Brill's Content''; and, {{cite web|url= http://www.fair.org/activism/abc-response.html | title = A Response by Stossel and Some of His Staff To the Group "FAIR"|accessdate =December 10, 2007|author=Stossel & staff |publisher=FAIR|quote=We stand by our report}}</ref>

====Organic vegetables====
A February 2000 story about [[organic food|organic]] vegetables on ''20/20'' included statements by Stossel that tests had shown that neither organic nor conventional produce samples contained any pesticide residue, and that organic food was more likely to be contaminated by ''[[Escherichia coli|E. coli]]'' bacteria. The [[Environmental Working Group]] objected to his report, mainly questioning his statements about bacteria, but also managed to determine that the produce had never been tested for pesticides. They communicated this to Stossel, but after the story's producer backed Stossel's recollection that the test results had been as described, the story was rebroadcast months later, uncorrected, and with a postscript in which Stossel reiterated his claim. Later, after a report in ''[[The New York Times]]'' confirmed the Environmental Working Group's claims, ABC News suspended the producer of the segment for a month and reprimanded Stossel. Stossel apologized, saying that he had thought the tests had been conducted as reported. However, he asserted that the gist of his report had been accurate.<ref name="Rutenberg">{{cite news | last=Rutenberg | first=Jim | title=Report on Organic Foods Is Challenged |work=The New York Times | date=July 31, 2000 | url=http://www.nytimes.com/library/financial/073100abc-organic.html | accessdate=September 1, 2007}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | url=http://abcnews.go.com/2020/story?id=124196&page=1 | title=20/20: Stossel Apology for Organic Food Report | date=August 11, 2000 | last=Stossel | first=John | publisher=ABC News | accessdate=September 26, 2007}}</ref><ref name="Rutenberg2">{{cite news | last=Rutenberg | first=Jim | coauthors=Barringer, Felicity | title=MEDIA; Apology Highlights ABC Reporter's Contrarian Image |work=The New York Times | date=August 14, 2000 | url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9804E3DA133FF937A2575BC0A9669C8B63&sec=health&pagewanted=print | accessdate=September 5, 2007}}</ref><ref name=blasphemer>{{cite news | url=http://www.lewrockwell.com/mcelroy/mcelroy21.html | title=Blaspheming Organic Food: The Persecution of John Stossel | last=McElroy | first=Wendy | date=August 15, 2000 | publisher=LewRockwell.com | accessdate=September 26, 2007}}</ref><ref name="givemeafake">{{cite news| url=http://www.ewg.org/reports/givemeafake | title=Give Me a Fake: Stossel Under Fire| publisher=Environmental Working Group | date=September 6, 2000 | accessdate=September 26, 2007}}</ref>

====Frederick K. Price====
In a March 2007 segment about finances and lifestyles of [[televangelist]]s, ''20/20'' aired a clip of Rev. [[Frederick K. C. Price|Frederick K. Price]], a TV minister, that was originally broadcast by the [[Lifetime Network]] in 1997. Price alleged that the clip portrayed him describing his wealth in extravagant terms, when he was actually telling a parable about a rich man. ABC News twice aired a retraction and apologized for the error.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.wavenewspapers.com/default.asp?sourceid=&smenu=71&twindow=&mad=&sdetail=6067&wpage=1&skeyword=&sidate=&ccat=&ccatm=&restate=&restatus=&reoption=&retype=&repmin=&repmax=&rebed=&rebath=&subname=&pform=&sc=1019&hn=wavenewspapers&he=.com|title=Price Strikes Back at ABC|last=Johnson|first=Gene C., Jr.|publisher=Los Angeles Wave|date=August 2, 2007|accessdate=September 26, 2007|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20071026100154/http://www.wavenewspapers.com/default.asp?sourceid=&smenu=71&twindow=&mad=&sdetail=6067&wpage=1&skeyword=&sidate=&ccat=&ccatm=&restate=&restatus=&reoption=&retype=&repmin=&repmax=&rebed=&rebath=&subname=&pform=&sc=1019&hn=wavenewspapers&he=.com|archivedate=October 26, 2007}}; and, {{cite news|url=http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/latimes/access/1309570171.html?dids=1309570171:1309570171&FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT&type=current&date=Jul+25%2C+2007&author=Alana+Semuels&pub=Los+Angeles+Times&edition=&startpage=C.1&desc=TELEVISION%3B+Preacher+sues+%6020%2F20%2C%27+alleging+defamation|title=Preacher sues '20/20,' alleging defamation|work=Los Angeles Times|date=July 25, 2007|last=Semuels|first=Alana|accessdate=September 26, 2007}}</ref> In August 2010, a lower court's dismissal of the minister's defamation suit against [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]], ''Price v.

===="Sick Sob Stories"====
In an opinion piece published in ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' in September 2007 called "Sick Sob Stories", Stossel described the case of Tracy and Julie Pierce that was explored in [[Michael Moore]]'s film, ''[[Sicko]]''.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://online.wsj.com/article/SB118964470258225901.html | title=Sick Sob Stories |work=Wall Street Journal | last=Stossel | first=John | date=September 13, 2007 | archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080125104512/http://online.wsj.com/article/SB118964470258225901.html|archivedate=January 25, 2008}}</ref> Julie Pierce criticized Stossel, saying her husband would have been saved by the [[Health care in Canada|Canadian health care system]], and she thought Stossel should have interviewed her and her doctor before writing about them.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.michaelmoore.com/sicko/news/article.php?id=10226 | title=Open Letter to ABC's John Stossel ... from Julie Pierce, American SiCKO | publisher=Michael Moore | last=Pierce | first=Julie | date=September 14, 2007 | accessdate=September 26, 2007}}</ref> Stossel expressed sympathy, but said she had been misled to believe the treatment was routinely available in Canada. He said that the treatment is also considered "experimental" in Canada, and is provided there even more rarely than in the U.S.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://abcnews.go.com/2020/Stossel/story?id=3649791&page=1 | title=Stossel Responds to 'Sicko' Letter | publisher=ABC News | date=September 25, 2007 | last=Stossel | first=John | accessdate=September 27, 2007}}</ref>

====Global warming====
Stossel challenges the notion that man-made [[global warming]] would have net negative consequences, pointing to assertedly warmer periods in human history.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.abcnews.go.com/2020/story?id=3061015 | title=The Global Warming Myth? | publisher=ABC News | last=Stossel | first=John | date=April 20, 2007 | accessdate=September 24, 2007}}</ref> Central to his argument is the idea that groups and individuals get much more public attention, donations, and government funding when they proclaim "this will be terrible" than groups that say "this is nothing to worry about." He points to groups like the [[World Wildlife Fund]], [[Greenpeace]], the [[Environmental Defense Fund]], the [[Natural Resources Defense Council]], and to activists such as [[Rachel Carson]] and
former U.S. Vice President [[Al Gore]] as examples of environmental [[scaremonger]]s.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2006/07/a_convenient_lie.html | title=A Convenient Lie | publisher=[[Real Clear Politics]] | last=Stossel | first=John | date=July 5, 2006 | accessdate=September 24, 2007}}</ref>

In 2001, the media watchdog organization FAIR criticized Stossel's reportage of global warming in his documentary, ''Tampering with Nature,'' for using "highly selective...information" that gave "center stage to three dissenters from among the 2,000 members of the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, which recently released a report stating that global temperatures are rising almost twice as fast as previously thought."<ref name=fair>[http://www.fair.org/activism/stossel-tampering.html FAIR Action Alert: Stossel Tampers with the Facts]. [[Fairness and Accuracy in Reporting|FAIR]]. Retrieved July 21, 2009.</ref>

In a 2006 discussion hosted by the [[Fraser Institute]], Stossel stated that he accepts that [[global warming]] has occurred in the past century, that it has been about one degree Celsius, and that man-made emissions "may be part of the cause." Nevertheless he groups environmental groups with astrologers and psychics in his second book, ''Myths, Lies and Downright Stupidity''. He stated that the "myths" come in with the debate about [[Mitigation of global warming|proposed solutions to reduce global warming]], which he argues will not solve the problem at all and will restrict people's freedom.<ref name=google>[http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=1876894381231272307 Myths, Lies, and Downright Stupidity].

====David Schultz incident====
On December 28, 1984, during an interview for ''20/20'' on [[professional wrestling]], wrestler [[David Schultz (professional wrestler)|David Schultz]] struck Stossel after Stossel stated that he thought professional wrestling was "fake". Stossel stated that he suffered from pain and buzzing in his ears eight weeks after the assault.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?sec=health&res=9803E4D71239F930A15751C0A963948260&n=Top%2fNews%2fHealth%2fDiseases%2c%20Conditions%2c%20and%20Health%20Topics%2fEars%20and%20Hearing | title=TV Notes; ABC Reporter May Sue Wrestler Who Hit Him | last=Kaplan | first=Peter W. |work=New York Times | date=February 23, 1985 | accessdate=September 28, 2007}}</ref> Stossel sued and obtained a settlement of $425,000 from the [[World Wrestling Entertainment|World Wrestling Federation]] (WWF).
