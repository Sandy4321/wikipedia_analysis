In the [[U.S. state]] of [[Kansas]], [[Interstate 70]] contains the first segment to start being paved and to be completed in the Interstate Highway System.  It extends from the Western border to the Eastern border covering {{convert|424|mi|km}} and passing through several of the state's principal cities in the process.

==Route description==
[[Image:Quality-i70.jpg|thumb|300px|I-70 crossing on the Lewis & Clark Viaduct over the Kansas River from Kansas to Missouri in Kansas City, as seen from [[Quality Hill, Kansas City|Quality Hill]].]]
I-70 is joined with [[U.S. Route 24 (Kansas)|US-24]] from the Colorado state line until US-24 splits at [[Levant, Kansas|Levant]] and runs north of I-70. At [[Colby, Kansas|Colby]], I-70 begins to turn southeast until it reaches [[Oakley, Kansas|Oakley]], where [[U.S. Route 40 (Kansas)|US-40]] joins with I-70 for a concurrent journey through most of the state. The route remains flat until it reaches the county line between [[Russell County, Kansas|Russell]] and [[Ellsworth County, Kansas|Ellsworth]] counties, where the road begins to travese rolling hills.

At [[Salina, Kansas|Salina]], [[Interstate 135 (Kansas)|Interstate 135]] begins its journey southward toward [[Wichita, Kansas|Wichita]], and I-70 continues through [[Abilene, Kansas|Abilene]] and [[Junction City, Kansas|Junction City]], where the road begins to run through the [[Flint Hills]].

In [[Topeka, Kansas|Topeka]], I-70 intersects a child route, [[Interstate 470 (Kansas)|I-470]], twice.  The second time it is intersected, the [[Kansas Turnpike]] merges, making I-70 into a [[toll road]].  This is one of only two sections of I-70 that are tolled (the other is along the [[Pennsylvania Turnpike]]).  I-70 carries this designation from Topeka to [[Bonner Springs, Kansas|Bonner Springs]].  It is the eastern terminus of the turnpike, and from there to [[U.S. Route 69 (Kansas)|18th Street]] and extending on to the Kansas eastern border, the highway is free.

I-70 enters Missouri via a main northern route on the Lewis and Clark Viaduct above the confluence of the [[Kansas River]] and [[Missouri River]] and a route designated "Alternate I-70" which has signs for I-70 as well as [[Interstate 670 (Kansas)|Interstate 670]] just south of Kansas City main downtown area.

The southern route is called the ''[[Jay B. Dillingham]] Memorial Highway'' after the former [[Kansas City Stockyards]] chairman.<ref>{{google maps |url=http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&hl=en&geocode=&q=Kansas+City,+MIssouri&ie=UTF8&ll=39.099094,-94.607606&spn=0.00801,0.017338&z=16&om=1 |accessdate=June 8, 2009}}</ref>

== History ==
The section of I-70 that is now the [[Kansas Turnpike]] was finished by 1956 and opened to traffic.<ref>{{cite news | last = | first = | title = Big Impact Seen For Local Area In Superhighway | newspaper = Lawrence Daily Journal-World | date = October 24, 1956 | pages = 1<U+2013>2 }}</ref><ref name="LJW-102056">{{cite news | title = KTA Officials Say Traffic Heavy on Pike This Morning | newspaper = Lawrence Daily Journal-World | date = October 20, 1956 }}</ref> West of Topeka, the freeway was constructed from Topeka west to [[Salina, Kansas|Salina]] at its junction with [[U.S. Route 81 in Kansas|U.S. Route 81]], as well as from [[Ogallah, Kansas|Ogallah]] to [[Grainfield, Kansas|Grainfield]].<ref>{{cite map|url=http://www.ksdot.org/burtransplan/maps/HistoricStateMaps.asp|title=1963-1964 Kansas State Highway Map|publisher=[[Kansas Department of Transportation]]|accessdate=February 26, 2011}}</ref> From Salina, the freeway was completed through [[Wilson, Kansas|Wilson]] the next year. A segment of I-70 from [[Levant, Kansas|Levant]] through Ogallah was finished by 1965.<ref>{{cite map|url=http://www.ksdot.org/burtransplan/maps/HistoricStateMaps.asp|title=1965 Kansas State Highway Map|publisher=Kansas Department of Transportation|accessdate=February 26, 2011}}</ref> Another section was built the following year connecting Wilson to Grainfield.<ref>{{cite map|url=http://www.ksdot.org/burtransplan/maps/HistoricStateMaps.asp|title=1966 Kansas State Highway Map|publisher=Kansas Department of Transportation|accessdate=February 26, 2011}}</ref> The freeway was completed through Kansas with a last section near the [[Colorado]] border in 1970.<ref>{{cite map|url=http://www.ksdot.org/burtransplan/maps/HistoricStateMaps.asp|title=1970 Kansas State Highway Map|publisher=Kansas Department of Transportation|accessdate=February 27, 2011}}</ref>

==Exit list==
Exit numbers correspond to the mileposts where they're located (numbered from west to east), except at exits 366, 371, 377, and 407, which are part of the [[Kansas Turnpike]] and use its mileposts instead.
