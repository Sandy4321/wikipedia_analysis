{{for|the parent company|Anheuser-Busch InBev}}

'''InBev''' is a subsidiary of [[Anheuser-Busch InBev]]. The company existed independently for several years - since the merger between [[Interbrew]] and [[AmBev]] and until the acquisition of [[Anheuser-Busch]]. InBev has operations in over 30 countries and sales in over 130 countries.<ref>http://www.inbev.com/press_releases/20050330.1.e.cfm</ref>  In 2006, it had a market capitalization of <U+20AC>30.6 billion and net profit of <U+20AC>3.2 billion on sales of <U+20AC>13.3 billion.

On July 13, 2008, InBev agreed to buy [[Anheuser-Busch]] for a total value of $52 billion, which would create a new company to be named Anheuser-Busch InBev. It was reported that Anheuser will get two seats on the combined board.<ref>[http://online.wsj.com/article/SB121598077288249131.html?mod=hpp_us_whats_news InBev Buys Anheuser-Busch for $49.91B]</ref> To obtain [[antitrust]] approval in the United States, InBev agreed to divest itself of the company that imports Labatt's beer, another InBev brand, into the United States; this transaction was completed on March 13, 2009.<ref>

The all-cash agreement, for $70 per share, or almost $52 billion, would create the world's largest brewer, uniting the maker of [[Budweiser (Anheuser-Busch)|Budweiser]] and [[Michelob]] with the producer of [[Stella Artois]], [[Bass (beer)|Bass]] and [[Brahma (beer)|Brahma]]. The two companies would have yearly sales of more than $36.4 billion, surpassing the current number one brewer, London based [[SABMiller]].<ref>[http://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/14/business/worldbusiness/14beer.html?ref=europe nytimes.com, Anheuser-Busch Agrees to Be Sold to InBev]</ref><ref>[http://www.marketwatch.com/news/story/anheuser-busch-accepts-70-share-52-billion/story.aspx?guid=%7B02125469-49F4-4C21-824D-01EB0623A817%7D&dist=hplatest marketwatch.com, Anheuser-Busch accepts $52 billion InBev offer]</ref>

==History==
InBev was created in 2004 from the merger of the Belgian company Interbrew and the Brazilian company AmBev.<ref>[http://www.beveragedaily.com/news/ng.asp?id=50355-interbrew-buys-ambev Interbrew buys AmBev and becomes world number one<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Before the merger with Ambev, Interbrew was the third largest brewing company in the world by volume, [[Anheuser-Busch]] was the largest, followed by [[SABMiller]] in second place. [[Heineken International]] was in fourth place and AmBev was the world's fifth largest brewer.

===Interbrew===
Interbrew's roots can be traced back to 1366 in Den Horen in [[Leuven]] when ''Brouwerij Artois'' was founded. Starting as early as the 1960s, the Artois brewery acquired several local breweries and hence consolidated its position in Belgium, until they expanded internationally by acquiring two Dutch breweries, [[Dommelsch]] in 1968 and [[Hengelo Bier]] in 1974. Finally in 1987, Artois and the [[Wallonia|Walloon]]-based brewer Piedboeuf, came together to form Interbrew.<ref>[http://www.interbrew.com InBev<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> The move onto the global scene only happened when Interbrew acquired the Canadian beer brand [[Labatt]]. The transaction also included Labatt's [[sports]]-related assets, namely the [[Toronto Blue Jays]] baseball club, the [[Toronto Argonauts]] football club, and [[The Sports Network]]. At the time, Labatt was not much smaller than Interbrew, and since then the company has been considered a multinational with both Canadian and Belgian roots.

Some important Interbrew brands are [[Tennents]], [[Stella Artois]], [[Boddingtons]], [[Beck's]], [[Staropramen]], [[Jupiler]], [[Leffe]], [[Labatt]], [[Hoegaarden Brewery|Hoegaarden]] and [[Bass (beer)|Bass]].

In December 2001 Interbrew, [[Danone]] (former owner of [[Kronenbourg]], and two other smaller brewers) were fined <U+20AC>91m for operating a [[cartel]] in [[Belgium]] while four Luxembourg companies were fined <U+20AC>448,000 the same month.<ref name='beer'>{{cite news | first= David| last= Gow| coauthors= | title=Heineken and Grolsch fined for price-fixing | date= 2007-04-18| publisher= | url =http://business.guardian.co.uk/story/0,,2059542,00.html | work =[[The Guardian]] | pages = | accessdate = 2007-08-01 | language = | location=London}}</ref>

===AmBev===

AmBev is a Brazilian beer company formed by a merger in 1999 between the Brahma and Antarctica breweries. It has a dominant position in South America.<ref>[http://www.ambev.com.br AmBev - Companhia de Bebidas das Am<U+00E9>ricas<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>[http://www.gstock.com/quote/abv.html Stock symbol abv - Gstock Supercomputer - Free stock picks, stocks and stock market quotes<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/6631147.stm | work=BBC News | title=Alcoholic beer taster gets payout | date=2007-05-06 | accessdate=2010-05-05}}</ref>

===Post-merger history===
InBev announced in 2005 and confirmed in 2006 that it would move the brewing of [[Hoegaarden Brewery|Hoegaarden]], whose brewery they found to have become obsolete, to the Piedboeuf brewery in [[Jupille]], which resulted in huge protests and great disappointment in the town of [[Hoegaarden]]. The beer, though, is made with a very special [[yeast]] that is difficult to cultivate and keep alive. The [[Jupille]]-based brewery proved not being capable of attaining desired levels of quality and InBev's sole alternative was to bring production back to the original [[Hoegaarden]]-brewery, causing great sarcasm in the media that, by that time, had become openly hostile towards the beer-giant.<ref>[http://www.beer-pages.com/protz/features/celis.htm Pierre Celis, Hoegaarden<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> In September 2007 however, it was announced that brewing would continue at the Hoegaarden Brewery in [[Hoegaarden]].

On June 12, 2008, InBev announced that it made a US$46 billion offer for the brewing firm Anheuser-Busch.<ref>[http://www.globalbeerleader.com/home.php InBev Proposes Combination with Anheuser-Busch]</ref>  This merger joined two of the world's four largest brewing companies (based on revenue) and created a company that brews three of the top beers in the world - Bud Light, Budweiser and [[Skol]]. InBev also stated that the merger would not result in any U.S. brewery closures and they would also attempt to keep on management and board members from both companies.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.nytimes.com/reuters/business/business-inbev.html | title=InBev: U.S. Anheuser Breweries to Stay After Merger  | author=Reuters | publisher=Reuters | date=2008-06-20 | accessdate=2008-06-20}}</ref>

On Sunday, July 13, 2008, Anheuser-Busch announced that they had agreed to an acquisition by InBev valued at about US$52 billion in cash, or $70 per share.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/14/business/worldbusiness/14beer.html | title=Anheuser-Busch Agrees to be Sold to InBev | author=Michael J. de la Merced | publisher=New York Times | date=2008-07-13 | accessdate=2008-07-13}}</ref> As a condition, InBev will be renamed '''Anheuser-Busch InBev''' and Anheuser-Busch would retain two seats on the board of directors.<ref>[http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601087&sid=aFeprSPTUVFk&refer=home InBev to Buy Anheuser-Busch for $49.9 Billion, Journal Says]</ref>
