'''Ann Arbor''' is a city in the [[U.S. state]] of [[Michigan]] and the [[county seat]] of [[Washtenaw County, Michigan|Washtenaw County]]. As of the [[2000 United States Census|2000 Census]], the city had a population of 114,024, of which 36,892 (32%) were university students.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://factfinder.census.gov/servlet/QTTable?_bm=y&-geo_id=16000US2603000&-qr_name=DEC_2000_SF3_U_DP2&-ds_name=DEC_2000_SF3_U&-_lang=en&-_sse=on|title=Ann Arbor city, Michigan<U+2014>DP-2. Profile of Selected Social Characteristics: 2000| year=2000 | publisher=US Census Bureau | accessdate=2008-08-04}}</ref> The 2009 Census Bureau Estimate places the population at 112,920, making it the [[List of municipalities in Michigan (by population)|sixth largest city in Michigan]]. The city is part of the [[Metro Detroit|Detroit <U+2013> Ann Arbor <U+2013> Flint, MI]] [[Combined Statistical Area|CSA]].

Ann Arbor was founded in 1824, with one theory stating that it is named after the spouses of the city's founders and for the stands of trees in the area.<ref name="Marwil, pp. 1-2">Marwil, pp. 1<U+2013>2</ref> The [[University of Michigan]] moved from [[Detroit]] to Ann Arbor in 1839, and the city showed steady growth throughout the 19th and 20th centuries, with a decline during the [[Long Depression|Depression of 1873]]. During the 1960s and 1970s, the city gained a reputation as an important center for liberal politics. Ann Arbor also became a focal-point for left-wing activism and served as a hub for the [[American civil rights movement|civil-rights movement]] and [[Opposition to U.S. involvement in the Vietnam War|anti-Vietnam War movement]], as well as the student movement.

Today, Ann Arbor is home to the [[University of Michigan]], which is the dominant institution of higher learning in the city. The university shapes Ann Arbor's economy significantly as it employs about 30,000 workers, including about 12,000 in the [[University of Michigan Health System|medical center]]. The city's economy is also centered on [[high technology]], with several companies drawn to the area by the university's research and development money, and by its graduates.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.city-data.com/us-cities/The-Midwest/Ann-Arbor-Introduction.html | title=Ann Arbor: Introduction | publisher=Advameg, Inc. | year=2008 | accessdate=2008-08-04}}</ref> Ann Arbor has increasingly found itself grappling with the effects of sharply rising land values and [[gentrification]], as well as [[urban sprawl]] stretching far into the outlying countryside.<ref name="greenbelt">{{cite web | url=http://www.a2openspace.org/ | title=Ann Arbor Parks and Greenbelt Proposal | date=March 2, 2004 | publisher=Friends of Ann Arbor Open Space | accessdate=2008-08-04}}</ref>

==History==
{{Main|History of Ann Arbor}}
Ann Arbor was founded in 1824 by land speculators [[John Allen (pioneer)|John Allen]] and [[Elisha Rumsey]]. On May&nbsp;25, 1824, the town [[plat]] was registered with Wayne County as "Annsarbour"; this represents the earliest known use of the town's name.<ref>Marwil, p. 1</ref> There are various accounts concerning the origin of the settlement's name; one states that Allen and Rumsey decided to name it for their wives, both named Ann, and for the stands of [[bur oak|burr oak]] in the {{convert|640|acre|ha}} of land they purchased for $800 from the federal government at $1.25 per acre.<ref name="Marwil, pp. 1-2"/> Regional Michigan [[Ojibwa]] named the settlement ''kaw-goosh-kaw-nick'', after the sound of Allen's [[sawmill]].<ref>{{cite book|author=Michigan State Historical Society, Michigan Pioneer and Historical Society|title=Michigan History Magazine|year=1964|publisher=Michigan Historical Commission|accessdate=2008-07-31|page=31}}</ref>

Ann Arbor became the seat of Washtenaw County in 1827,<ref>Marwil, p. 4</ref> and was incorporated as a village in 1833.<ref>Marwil, p. 7</ref> The Ann Arbor Land Company, a group of speculators, set aside {{convert|40|acre|ha|abbr=off}} of undeveloped land and offered it to the state of Michigan as the site of the state capital, but lost the bid to [[Lansing, Michigan|Lansing]]. In 1837, the property was accepted instead as the site of the [[University of Michigan]], which moved from Detroit.<ref>Marwil, p. 13</ref>

Since the university's establishment in the city in 1837, the history of both the University of Michigan and Ann Arbor are closely linked.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://moaa.aadl.org/moaa/pictorial_history/1824-1859pg3 | title=1824<U+2013>1859: Education.

During the 1960s and 1970s, the city gained a reputation as an important center for liberal politics. Ann Arbor also became a locus for left-wing activism and served as a hub for the [[American civil rights movement|civil-rights movement]] and [[Opposition to U.S. involvement in the Vietnam War|anti-Vietnam War movement]], as well as the student movement. The first major meetings of the national left-wing campus group [[Students for a Democratic Society (1960 organization)|Students for a Democratic Society]] took place in Ann Arbor in 1960; in 1965, the city was home to the first U.S. [[teach-in]] against the [[Vietnam War]].<ref>Marwil, p. 153</ref> During the ensuing fifteen years, many [[counterculture|countercultural]] and [[New Left]] enterprises sprang up and developed large constituencies within the city.<ref name="history">{{cite web | url=http://moaa.aadl.org/moaa/pictorial_history/1940-1974pg3 | title=1940<U+2013>1974: From Protest to Outer Space.

Following a 1956 vote the city of East Ann Arbor merged with Ann Arbor to encompass the eastern sections of the city.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pittsfieldhistory.org/index.php?section=history&content=east_ann_arbor#services|title=Inside the Eastside: History of East Ann Arbor, Michigan (MI)|accessdate=2010-04-09}}</ref>

In the past several decades, Ann Arbor has grappled with the effects of sharply rising land values, [[gentrification]], and [[urban sprawl]] stretching into outlying countryside. On November&nbsp;4, 2003, voters approved a [[green belt|greenbelt]] plan under which the city government bought development rights to pieces of land adjacent to Ann Arbor to preserve them from sprawling development.<ref name="greenbelt" /> Since then, a vociferous local debate has hinged on how and whether to accommodate and guide development within city limits.<ref>{{cite journal | url=http://www.mlive.com/news/ann-arbor/index.ssf/2009/05/ann_arbor_seeks_grants_for_gre.html | title=Ann Arbor seeks grants for greenbelt land | author=McGovern, Judy | date=2009-05-18 | journal=The Ann Arbor News | accessdate=2009-08-24}}</ref> Ann Arbor consistently ranks in the "top places to live" lists published by various mainstream media outlets every year.

Many Ann Arbor cultural attractions and events are sponsored by the University of Michigan. Several performing arts groups and facilities are on the university's campus, as are [[Museums at the University of Michigan|museums]] dedicated to [[art]], [[archaeology]], and natural history and sciences. Regional and local performing arts groups not associated with the university include the Ann Arbor Civic Theatre, the Arbor Opera Theater, the [[Ann Arbor Symphony Orchestra]], the Ann Arbor Ballet Theater, the Ann Arbor Civic Ballet (established in 1954 as Michigan's first chartered ballet company),<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.sylviastudio.com/civic.htm | title=Ann Arbor Civic Ballet | publisher=Sylvia Studio of Dance <U+2013> Ann Arbor Civic Ballet | year=2009 | accessdate=2009-09-06}}</ref> [[The Ark (folk venue)|The Ark]], and [[Performance Network Theatre]], which operates a downtown theater and frequently offers new or nontraditional plays.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.performancenetwork.org/about_mission.php | title=About PN<U+2014>Mission | publisher=Performance Network Theatre | year=2009 | accessdate=2009-08-23}}</ref> Another unique piece of artistic expression in Ann Arbor is the [[Fairy Doors of Ann Arbor, MI|fairy doors]].

The [[Ann Arbor Hands-On Museum]], located in a renovated and expanded historic downtown fire station, contains more than 250 interactive exhibits featuring science and technology. Multiple art galleries exist in the city, notably in the downtown area and around the University of Michigan campus. Aside from a large restaurant scene in the Main Street, South State Street, and South University Avenue areas, Ann Arbor ranks first among U.S. cities in the number of booksellers and books sold per capita.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://web.archive.org/web/20041210170216/ecurrent.com/ag/2003/shop/list.php#boo | title=Ann Arbor Guide 2003<U+2013>4 | year=2003<U+2013>2004 | publisher=Ecurrent.com | accessdate=2008-08-04}}</ref> The [[Ann Arbor District Library]] maintains four branch outlets in addition to its main downtown building.

Several annual events<U+2014>many of them centered on performing and visual arts<U+2014>draw visitors to Ann Arbor. One such event is the [[Ann Arbor Art Fairs]], a set of four concurrent juried fairs held on downtown streets, which began in 1960.

Until (at least) the successful passage of Michigan's medical marijuana law, the event had arguably strayed from its initial intent, although for years, a number of attendees have received serious legal responses due to marijuana use on University of Michigan property, which does not fall under the City's progressive and compassionate ticketing program.

For a period during the latter 1960s, the Ann Arbor vicinity acquired a greater recognition globally among certain fans of rock music, as the area included a number of popular groups which originated in Ann Arbor, were frequent visitors of Ann Arbor, or settled in the city or surrounding area. Among these were Detroit transplants [[MC5]], as well as [[The Stooges]], [[SRC (band)|SRC]],  [[The Up]], [[The Rationals]] and others.
