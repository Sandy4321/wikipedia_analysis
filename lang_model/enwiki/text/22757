{{History of Scotland}}
'''Scotland in the Middle Ages''' concerns the history of the region that is now Scotland, from the departure of the Romans in the early fifth century, to the adoption of major aspects of the Renaissance in the early sixteenth century. From the fifth century North Britain was divided into a series of petty kingdoms. Of these the four most important to emerge were the [[Picts]], the Scots of [[D<U+00E1>l Riata]], the Britons of [[Kingdom of Strathclyde|Strathclyde]] and the [[Angles|Anglian]] kingdom of [[Bernicia]]. After the arrival of the [[Vikings]] in the late eighth century, Scandinavian rulers and colonies were established along parts of the coasts and in the islands. In the ninth century the Scots and Picts combined under the [[House of Alpin]] to form a single [[Kingdom of Alba]], with a Pictish base and dominated by Gaelic culture. After the reign of [[King David I]] in the twelfth century, the [[Scottish monarchs]] are best described as [[Scoto-Norman]], preferring [[French culture]] to native Scottish culture. [[Alexander II of Scotland|Alexander II]] and his son [[Alexander III of Scotland|Alexander III]], were able to annexe the remainder of the western seaboard, cumulating the [[Treaty of Perth]] with Norway in 1266. Scotland established its independence from England under figures including [[William Wallace]] in the late thirteenth century and [[Robert I of Scotland|Robert Bruce]] in the fourteenth century. In the fifteenth century under the [[Stewart Dynasty]], despite a turbulent political history, the crown gained greater political control at the expense of independent lords and regained most of its lost territory to approximately the modern borders of the country. However, the [[Auld Alliance]] with France led to the heavy defeat of a Scottish army at the [[Battle of Flodden Field]] in 1513 and the death of the king [[James IV of Scotland|James IV]], which would be followed by a long minority and a period of political instability.

Kingship was the major form of government, growing in sophistication in the late Middle Ages. The scale and nature of war also changed, with larger armies, naval forces and the development of artillery and fortifications. Christianity introduced monasticism and what has been identified as [[Celtic Christianity]]. Nevertheless, the church accepted papal authority and from the eleventh century embraced monastic reform, developing a flourishing religious culture that asserted its independence from English control. Scotland grew from a relatively small area in the eastern Lowlands, to approximately its modern borders. The varied and dramatic geography of the land provided a protection against invasion, but limited central control. It also defined the largely pastoral economy, with the first [[burgh]]s being created from the twelfth century. The population may have grown to a peak of a million before the arrival of the [[Black Death]] in 1337. In the early Middle Ages society was divided between a small aristocracy and larger numbers of freemen and slaves. Serfdom disappeared in the fourteenth century and there was a growth of new social groups. 

The [[Pictish]] and [[Cumbric]] languages were replaced by [[Gaelic language|Gaelic]], [[Old English]] and later [[Old Norse|Norse]], with Gaelic emerging as the major cultural language. From the eleventh century French was adopted in the court and in the late Middle Ages, [[Scots language|Scots]], derived from Old English, became dominant, with Gaelic largely confined to the Highlands. Christianity brought Latin, written culture and monasteries as centres of learning. From the twelfth century, educational opportunities widened and a growth of lay education cumulated in the [[Education Act 1496]]. Until in the fifteenth century, when Scotland gained three universities, Scots pursuing higher education had to travel to England or the continent, where some gained an international reputation. Literature survives in all the major languages present in the early Middle Ages, with Scots emerging as a major literary language from [[John Barbour (poet)|John Barbour]]'s ''[[Brus]]'' (1375), developing a culture of poetry by court [[makars]], and later major works of prose. Art from the early Middle Ages survives in carving, in metalwork, and elaborate illuminated books, which contributed to the development of the wider [[insular art|insular style]]. Much of the finest later work has not survived, but there are a few key examples, particularly of work commissioned in the Netherlands. Scotland had a musical tradition, with secular music composed and performed by [[bard]]s and from the thirteenth century, church music increasingly influenced by continental and English forms.

====Minor kingdoms====
In the centuries after the departure of the Romans from Britain, four major circles of influence emerged within the borders of what is now Scotland. In the east were the [[Picts]], whose kingdoms eventually stretched from the river Forth to Shetland. The first identifiable king to have exerted a superior and wide-ranging authority, was [[Bridei I of the Picts|Bridei mac Maelchon]] (r. c. 550-84), whose power was based in the kingdom of Fidach and his base was at the fort of Craig Phadrig near modern [[Inverness]].<ref name=Haywoodp2004p116>J. Haywood, ''The Celts: Bronze Age to New Age'' (London: Pearson Education, 2004), ISBN 058250578X, p. 116.</ref> After his death leadership seems to have shifted to the [[Fortriu]], whose lands were centred on [[Strathearn]] and [[Menteith]] and who raided along the eastern coast into modern England. Christian missionaries from [[Iona]] appear to have begun the conversion of the Picts to Christianity from 563.<ref name=Smyth1989pp43-6/> 

In the west were the Gaelic ([[Goidelic]])-speaking people of [[D<U+00E1>l Riata]] with their royal fortress at [[Dunadd]] in Argyll, with close links with the island of Ireland, from which they brought with them the name Scots. In 563 a mission from Ireland under [[St. Columba]] founded the monastery of [[Iona]] off the west coast of Scotland and probably began the conversion of the region to Christianity.<ref name=Smyth1989pp43-6>A.

Woolf, ''From Pictland to Alba: 789 - 1070'' (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 2007), ISBN 0748612343, pp. 57-67.</ref>

In the south was the British ([[Britons (historical)|Brythonic]]) [[Kingdom of Strathclyde]], descendants of the peoples of the Roman influenced kingdoms of "[[Y Gogledd Hen|The Old North]]", often named Alt Clut, the Brythonic name for their capital at [[Dumbarton Rock]]. In 642, they defeated the men of D<U+00E1>l Riata,<ref>A. Macquarrie, "The kings of Strathclyde, c. 400-1018", in G. W. S. Barrow, A. Grant and K. J.

Gibb, ''Glasgow, the Making of a City'' (London: Routledge, 1983), ISBN 0709901615, p. 7.</ref> 

Finally, there were the English or "Angles", Germanic invaders who had overrun much of southern Britain and held the Kingdom of [[Bernicia]], in the south-east.<ref>J. R. Maddicott and D. M.

====Origins of the Kingdom of Alba====
{{Main|Origins of the Kingdom of Alba}}
This situation was transformed in AD 793 when ferocious Viking raids began on monasteries like Iona and Lindisfarne, creating fear and confusion across the kingdoms of North Britain. [[Orkney Islands|Orkney]], [[Shetland Isles|Shetland]] and the Western Isles eventually fell to the Norsemen.<ref>W. E.

[[Image:Wikinger.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Danish seamen, painted mid-twelfth century.]]
These threats may have speeded a long term process of gaelicisation of the Pictish kingdoms, which adopted Gaelic language and customs. There was also a merger of the Gaelic and Pictish crowns, although historians debate whether it was a Pictish takeover of D<U+00E1>l Riata, or the other way around. This culminated in the rise of [[Kenneth I of Scotland|C<U+00ED>naed mac Ailp<U+00ED>n]] (Kenneth MacAlpin) in the 840s, which brought to power the [[House of Alpin]].<ref name=Yorke2006p54>B.

===High Middle Ages===
{{Main|Scotland in the High Middle Ages}}

====Gaelic kings: Constantine II to Alexander I====
{{Main|House of Dunkeld}}
The long reign (900<U+2013>942/3) of [[Constantine II of Scotland|Causant<U+00ED>n]] (Constantine II) is often regarded as the key to formation of the Kingdom of Alba. He was later credited with bringing Scottish Christianity into conformity with the Catholic Church. After fighting many battles, his defeat at [[Brunanburh]] was followed by his retirement as a [[Culdee]] monk at St. Andrews.<ref>A. Woolf, ''From Pictland to Alba: 789 - 1070'' (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 2007), ISBN 0748612343, p. 128.</ref> The period between the accession of his successor [[Malcolm I of Scotland|M<U+00E1>el Coluim I]] (Malcolm I) and M<U+00E1>el Coluim mac Cin<U+00E1>eda (Malcolm II) was marked by good relations with the [[Wessex]] [[Kings of England|rulers of England]], intense internal dynastic disunity and relatively successful expansionary policies. In 945, M<U+00E1>el Coluim I annexed [[Kingdom of Strathclyde|Strathclyde]] as part of a deal with King [[Edmund I of England|Edmund of England]], where the kings of Alba had probably exercised some authority since the later ninth century,<ref>B. T. Hudson, ''Kings of Celtic Scotland'' (Westport: Greenhill 1994), ISBN 0313290873, pp. 95<U+2013>6.</ref> an event offset somewhat by loss of control in Moray. The reign of King [[Duncan I of Scotland|Donnchad I]] (Duncan I) from 1034 was marred by failed military adventures, and he was defeated and killed by MacBeth, the [[Mormaer of Moray]], who became king in 1040.<ref>B. T. Hudson, ''Kings of Celtic Scotland'' (Westport: Greenhill 1994), ISBN 0313290873, p. 124.</ref> MacBeth ruled for seventeen years before he was overthrown by [[Malcolm III of Scotland|M<U+00E1>el Coluim]], the son of Donnchad, who some months later defeated MacBeth's [[Stepfamily|step-son]] and successor Lulach to become king M<U+00E1>el Coluim III (Malcolm III).<ref name=Mackie43>J. D. Mackie, ''A History of Scotland'' (London: Pelican, 1964). p. 43.</ref> 

It was M<U+00E1>el Coluim III, who acquired the nickname "Canmore" (''Cenn M<U+00F3>r'', "Great Chief"), which he passed to his successors and who did most to create the [[House of Dunkeld|Dunkeld dynasty]] that ruled Scotland for the following two centuries. Particularly important was his second marriage to the Anglo-Hungarian princess [[Saint Margaret of Scotland|Margaret]].<ref>A. A. M. Duncan, ''Scotland: The Making of the Kingdom, The Edinburgh History of Scotland, Volume 1'' (Edinburgh: Mercat Press,1989), p. 119.</ref> This marriage, and raids on northern England, prompted [[William I of England|William the Conqueror]] to invade and M<U+00E1>el Coluim submitted to his authority, opening up Scotland to later claims of sovereignty by English kings.<ref>A. A. M. Duncan, ''Scotland: The Making of the Kingdom, The Edinburgh History of Scotland, Volume 1'' (Edinburgh: Mercat Press,1989), p. 120</ref> When Malcolm died in 1093, his brother [[Donald III of Scotland|Domnall III]] (Donald III) succeeded him. However, [[William II of England]] backed M<U+00E1>el Coluim's son by his first marriage, [[Duncan II|Donnchad]], as a pretender to the throne and he seized power. His murder within a few months saw Domnall restored with one of M<U+00E1>el Coluim sons by his second marriage, [[Edmund of Scotland|Edmund]], as his heir. The two ruled Scotland until two of Edmund's younger brothers returned from exile in England, again with English military backing. Victorious, [[Edgar of Scotland|Edgar]], the oldest of the three, became king in 1097.<ref name=Webster1997pp23-4>B.

In practice Norse control of the Isles was loose, with local chiefs enjoying a high degree of independence. He was succeeded by his brother [[Alexander I of Scotland|Alexander]], who reigned 1107<U+2013>24.<ref>A. Forte, R. D. Oram and F.

[[File:Scotland from the Matthew Paris map, c.1250.jpg|thumb|Scotland from the Matthew Paris map, c. 1250.]]
When Alexander died in 1124, the crown passed to Margaret's fourth son [[David I of Scotland|David I]], who had spent most of his life as an English baron. His reign saw what has been characterised as a  "[[Davidian Revolution]]", by which native institutions and personnel were replaced by English and French ones, underpinning the development of later Medieval Scotland.<ref name=Barrow1992pp9-11>G.

Lynch, ''Scotland: A New History'' (Random House, 2011), ISBN 1446475638, p. 80.</ref> Members of the Anglo-Norman nobility took up places in the Scottish aristocracy and he introduced a system of [[feudalism|feudal]] land tenure, which produced [[knight service]], castles and an available body of heavily armed body of cavalry. He created an Anglo-Norman style of court, introduced the office of [[justicar]] to oversee justice, and local offices of [[sheriffs]] to administer localities. He established the first [[royal burgh]]s in Scotland, granting rights to particular settlements, which led to the development of the first true Scottish towns and helped facilitate economic development as did the introduction of the first recorded Scottish coinage. He continued a process begun by his mother and brothers, of helping to establish foundations that brought the reformed monasticism based on that at [[Cluny Abbey|Cluny]]. He also played a part in the organisation of diocese on lines closer to those in the rest of Western Europe.<ref name=Webster1997pp29-37>B. Webster, ''Medieval Scotland: the Making of an Identity'' (St. Martin's Press, 1997), ISBN 0333567617, pp. 29-37.</ref> 

These reforms were pursued under his successors and grandchildren [[Malcolm IV of Scotland]] and [[William I of Scotland|William I]], with the crown now passing down the main line of descent through primogeniture, leading to the first of a series of minorities.<ref name=Webster1997pp23-4/> The benefits of greater authority were reaped by William's son [[Alexander II of Scotland|Alexander II]] and his son [[Alexander III of Scotland|Alexander III]], who pursued a policy of peace with England to expand their authority in the Highlands and Islands. By the reign of Alexander III, the Scots were in a position to annexe the remainder of the western seaboard, which they did following [[Haakon IV of Norway|Haakon Haakonarson]]'s ill-fated invasion and the stalemate of the [[Battle of Largs]] with the [[Treaty of Perth]] in 1266.<ref name=Macquarrie2004p153>A.

The death of king Alexander III in 1286, and then of his granddaughter and heir [[Margaret, Maid of Norway]] in 1290, left 14 rivals for succession. To prevent civil war the Scottish magnates asked [[Edward I of England]] to arbitrate, for which he extracted legal recognition that the realm of Scotland was held as a feudal dependency to the throne of England before choosing [[John Balliol]], the man with the strongest claim, who became king in 1292.<ref>R.

After David II's death, [[Robert II of Scotland|Robert II]], the first of the Stewart kings, came to the throne in 1371. He was followed in 1390 by his ailing son John, who took the [[regnal name]] [[Robert III of Scotland|Robert III]]. During Robert III's reign (1390<U+2013>1406), actual power rested largely in the hands of his brother, [[Robert Stewart, Duke of Albany]].<ref name=Rigby2003>S. H. Rigby, ''A Companion to Britain in the Later Middle Ages'' (Oxford: Wiley-Blackwell, 2003), ISBN 0631217851, pp. 301-2.</ref> After the suspicious death (possibly on the orders of the Duke of Albany) of his elder son, David, Duke of Rothesay in 1402, Robert, fearful for the safety of his younger son, the future [[James I of Scotland|James I]], sent him to France in 1406. However, the English captured him en route and he spent the next 18 years as a prisoner held for ransom. As a result, after the death of Robert III, regents ruled Scotland: first, the Duke of Albany; and later his son [[Murdoch Stewart, Duke of Albany|Murdoch]].<ref>A. D. M.

==Geography==
{{Main|Geography of Scotland in the Middle Ages}}
Modern Scotland is half the size England and Wales in area, but with its many inlets, islands and inland [[lochs]], it has roughly the same amount of coastline at 4,000 miles. Only a fifth of Scotland is less than 60 metres above sea level. Its east Atlantic position means that it has very heavy rainfall: today about 700&nbsp;cm per year in the east and over 1,000&nbsp;cm in the west. This encouraged the spread of blanket [[peat bog]], the acidity of which, combined with high level of wind and salt spray, made most of the islands treeless. The existence of hills, mountains, quicksands and marshes made internal communication and conquest extremely difficult and may have contributed to the fragmented nature of political power.<ref>C. Harvie, ''Scotland: a Short History'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2002), ISBN 0192100548, pp. 10-11.</ref>

The defining factor in the geography of Scotland is the distinction between the [[Highlands and Islands]] in the north and west and the [[Scottish lowlands|Lowlands]] in the south and east. The highlands are further divided into the [[Northwest Highlands]] and the [[Grampian Mountains]] by the fault line of the [[Great Glen]]. The lowlands are divided into the fertile belt of the [[Central Lowlands]] and the higher terrain of the [[Southern Uplands]], which included the [[Cheviot hills]], over which the border with England came to run by the end of the period.<ref>R. Mitchison, ''A History of Scotland'' (London: Routledge, 3rd edn., 2002), ISBN 0415278805, p. 2.</ref> Some of these were further divided by mountains, major rivers and marshes.<ref name=Webster1997pp9-20>B.

Ogilvie, ''Great Britain: Essays in Regional Geography'' (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1952), p. 421.</ref> and the two major attempts at conquest by the English, under Edward I and then Edward III, were unable to penetrate the highlands, from which area potential resistance could reconquer the Lowlands.<ref>R.

===Language and culture===
{{Main|Celtic languages}}
Modern linguists divide Celtic languages into two major groups, the [[P-Celtic]], from which the [[Brythonic languages]]: [[Welsh language|Welsh]], [[Breton language|Breton]], [[Cornish language|Cornish]] and [[Cumbric]] derive, and the [[Q-Celtic]], from which come the [[Goidelic languages]]: [[Irish language|Irish]], [[Manx language|Manx]] and [[Gaelic language|Gaelic]]. The Pictish language remains enigmatic, since the Picts had no written script of their own and all that survives are place names and some isolated inscriptions in Irish [[ogham]] script.<ref name=Haywoodp2004p116/> Most modern linguists accept that, although the nature and unity of Pictish language is unclear, it belonged to the former group.<ref>R. Mitchison, ''A History of Scotland'', (London: Routledge, 3rd edn., 2002), ISBN 0415278805, p. 4.</ref> Historical sources, as well as place name evidence, indicate the ways in which the Pictish language in the north and Cumbric languages in the south were overlaid and replaced by Gaelic, [[Old English]] and later [[Norse language|Norse]] in this period.<ref>W. O. Frazer and A. Tyrrell, ''Social Identity in Early Medieval Britain'' (London: Continuum,  2000), ISBN 0718500849, p. 238.</ref> By the High Middle Ages the majority of people within Scotland spoke the Gaelic language, then simply called ''Scottish'', or in Latin, ''lingua Scotica''.<ref>G.

Our fuller sources for Ireland of the same period suggest that there would have been [[filidh]], who acted as poets, musicians and historians, often attached to the court of a lord or king, and passed on their knowledge and culture in Gaelic to the next generation.<ref name=Crawford2009/><ref name=Houston2002p76>R.

After this "de-gallicisation" of the Scottish court, a less highly regarded order of [[bard]]s took over the functions of the filidh and they would continue to act in a similar role in the Highlands and Islands into the eighteenth century. They often trained in bardic schools, of which a few, like the one run by the [[MacMhuirich bardic family|MacMhuirich]] dynasty, who were bards to the [[Lord of the Isles]],<ref>K. M.

In the late Middle Ages, [[Middle Scots]], often simply called English, became the dominant language of the country. It was derived largely from Old English, with the addition of elements from Gaelic and French. Although resembling the language spoken in northern England, it became a distinct dialect from the late fourteenth century onwards.<ref name="Wormald1991pp60-7">J. Wormald, ''Court, Kirk, and Community: Scotland, 1470-1625'' (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 1991), ISBN 0748602763, pp. 60-7.</ref> It began to be adopted by the ruling elite as they gradually abandoned French. By the fifteenth century it was the language of government, with acts of parliament, council records and treasurer's accounts almost all using it from the reign of James I onwards. As a result, Gaelic, once dominant north of the Tay, began a steady decline.<ref name="Wormald1991pp60-7"/> Lowland writers began to treat Gaelic as a second class, rustic and even amusing language, helping to frame attitudes towards the highlands and to create a cultural gulf with the lowlands.<ref name="Wormald1991pp60-7"/>

===Education===
{{Main|History of education in Scotland}}
The establishment of Christianity brought Latin to Scotland as a scholarly and written language. Monasteries served as major repositories of knowledge and education, often running schools and providing a small educated elite, who were essential to create and read documents in a largely illiterate society.<ref name=Macquarrie2004p128>A. Macquarrie, ''Medieval Scotland: Kinship and Nation'' (Thrupp: Sutton, 2004), ISBN 0-7509-2977-4, p. 128.</ref> In the High Middle Ages new sources of education arose, with [[choir school|song]] and [[grammar school]]s. These were usually attached to cathedrals or a [[collegiate church]] and were most common in the developing burghs. By the end of the Middle Ages grammar schools could be found in all the main burghs and some small towns. Early examples including the [[High School of Glasgow]] in 1124 and the [[High School of Dundee]] in 1239.<ref name=Bawcutt&Williams2006pp29-30/> There were also petty schools, more common in rural areas and providing an elementary education.<ref name=Lynchpp104-7>M. Lynch, ''Scotland: A New History'' (Random House, 2011), ISBN 1446475638, pp. 104-7.</ref> Some monasteries, like the Cistercian [[Kinloss Abbey|abbey at Kinloss]], opened their doors to a wider range of students.<ref name=Lynchpp104-7/> The number and size of these schools seems to have expanded rapidly from the 1380s. They were almost exclusively aimed at boys, but by the end of the fifteenth century, Edinburgh also had schools for girls, sometimes described as "sewing schools", and probably taught by lay women or nuns.<ref name=Bawcutt&Williams2006pp29-30/><ref name=Lynchpp104-7/> There was also the development of private tuition in the families of lords and wealthy burghers.<ref name=Bawcutt&Williams2006pp29-30/> The growing emphasis on education cumulated with the passing of the [[Education Act 1496]], which decreed that all sons of barons and freeholders of substance should attend grammar schools to learn "perfyct Latyne". All this resulted in an increase in literacy, but which was largely concentrated among a male and wealthy elite,<ref name=Bawcutt&Williams2006pp29-30>P. J. Bawcutt and J. H. Williams, ''A Companion to Medieval Scottish Poetry'' (Woodbridge: Brewer, 2006), ISBN 1843840960, pp. 29-30.</ref> with perhaps 60 per cent of the nobility being literate by the end of the period.<ref name=Wormald1991pp68-72>J.

[[File:Tower of St. Salvator's College, St. Andrews Fife.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Tower of [[St Salvator's College, St Andrews]], one of the three universities founded in the fifteenth century.]]
Until the fifteenth century, those who wished to attend university had to travel to England or the continent, and just over a 1,000 have been identified as doing so between the twelfth century and 1410.<ref name=Websterpp124-5/> Among these the most important intellectual figure was [[John Duns Scotus]], who studied at [[University of Oxford|Oxford]], [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]] and [[University of Paris|Paris]] and probably died at [[University of Cologne|Cologne]] in 1308, becoming a major influence on late Medieval religious thought.<ref name=Websterpp119>B.

Webster, ''Medieval Scotland: the Making of an Identity'' (St. Martin's Press, 1997), ISBN 0333567617, pp. 124-5.</ref> Some Scottish scholars became teachers in continental universities. At Paris this included John De Rate and [[Walter Wardlaw]] in the 1340s and 1350s, William de Tredbrum in the 1380s and Laurence de Lindores in the early 1500s.<ref name=Websterpp124-5/> This situation was transformed by the founding of the [[University of St Andrews]] in 1413, the [[University of Glasgow]] in 1450 and the [[University of Aberdeen]] in 1495.<ref name=Bawcutt&Williams2006pp29-30/> Initially these institutions were designed for the training of clerics, but they would increasingly be used by laymen who would begin to challenge the clerical monopoly of administrative post in the government and law. Those wanting to study for second degrees still needed to go elsewhere and Scottish scholars continued to visit the continent and English universities reopened to Scots in the late fifteenth century.<ref name=Websterpp124-5/> The continued movement to other universities produced a school of Scottish [[nominalists]] at Paris in the early sixteenth century, of which [[John Mair]] was probably the most important figure. He had probably studied at a Scottish grammar school, then Cambridge, before moving to Paris, where he matriculated in 1493. By 1497 the humanist and historian [[Hector Boece]], born in Dundee and who had studied at Paris, returned to became the first principal at the new university of Aberdeen.<ref name=Websterpp124-5/> These international contacts helped integrate Scotland into a wider European scholarly world and would be one of the most important ways in which the new ideas of [[humanism]] were brought into Scottish intellectual life.<ref name=Wormald1991pp68-72/>

In the early middles ages, there were distinct material cultures evident in the different linguistic groups, federations and kingdoms within what is now Scotland.

In the late twelfth century, [[Giraldus Cambrensis]] noted that "in the opinion of many, Scotland not only equals its teacher, Ireland, but indeed greatly outdoes it and excels her in musical skill".

==National identity==
{{Main|Scottish identity}}
[[Image:Lionrampant.svg|thumb|The Royal Standard of Scotland, first adopted by king [[William I of Scotland|William I]], (1143<U+2013>1214)]]
In the High Middle Ages the word "Scot" was only used by Scots to describe themselves to foreigners, amongst whom it was the most common word. They called themselves ''Albanach'' or simply ''Gaidel''. Both "Scot" and ''Gaidel'' were ethnic terms that connected them to the majority of the inhabitants of Ireland. At the beginning of the thirteenth century, the author of ''[[De Situ Albanie]]'' noted that: "The name Arregathel [Argyll] means margin of the Scots or Irish, because all Scots and Irish are generally called 'Gattheli'."<ref>A. O. Anderson, ''Early Sources of Scottish History: AD 500<U+2013>1286'', 2 Vols, (Edinburgh, 1922). vol. i. p. cxviii.</ref> Scotland came to possess a unity which transcended Gaelic, French and Germanic ethnic differences and by the end of the period, the Latin, French and English word "Scot" could be used for any subject of the Scottish king. Scotland's multilingual [[Scoto-Norman]] monarchs and mixed Gaelic and Scoto-Norman aristocracy all became part of the "Community of the Realm", in which ethnic differences were less divisive than in Ireland and Wales.<ref>G. W. S. Barrow, ''Kingship and Unity: Scotland 1000-1306'' (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 1989), ISBN 074860104X, pp. 122<U+2013>43.</ref> This identity was defined in opposition to English attempts to annex the country and as a result of social and cultural changes. The resulting antipathy towards England dominated Scottish foreign policy well into the fifteenth century, making it extremely difficult for Scottish kings like James III and James IV to pursue policies of peace towards their southern neighbour.<ref>A. D. M. Barrell, ''Medieval Scotland'' (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2000), ISBN 052158602X, p. 134.</ref> In particular the ''Declaration of Arbroath'' asserted the ancient distinctiveness of Scotland in the face of English aggression, arguing that it was the role of the king to defend the independence of the community of Scotland. This document has been seen as the first "nationalist theory of sovereignty".<ref name=Kidd2003pp17-18>C. Kidd, ''Subverting Scotland's Past: Scottish Whig Historians and the Creation of an Anglo-British Identity 1689-1830'' (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2003), ISBN 0521520193, pp. 17-18.</ref> 

[[File:Flag of Scotland.svg|thumb|left|The [[Flag of Scotland|Cross of St. Andrew]], adopted as a national symbol in this period.]]
The adoption of Middle Scots by the aristocracy has been seen as building a shared sense of national solidarity and culture between rulers and ruled, although the fact that north of the Tay Gaelic still dominated may have helped widen the cultural divide between highlands and lowlands.<ref name=Wormald1991pp55-7/> The national literature of Scotland created in the late medieval period employed legend and history in the service of the crown and nationalism, helping to foster a sense of national identity, at least within its elite audience. The epic poetic history of the ''Brus'' and ''Wallace'' helped outline a narrative of united struggle against the English enemy. Arthurian literature differed from conventional version of the legend by treating [[King Arthur|Arthur]] as a villain and [[Mordred]], the son of the king of the Picts, as a hero.<ref name=Wormald1991pp55-7>J. Wormald, ''Court, Kirk, and Community: Scotland, 1470-1625'' (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 1991), ISBN 0748602763, pp. 66-7.</ref> The origin myth of the Scots, systematised by [[John of Fordun]] (c. 1320-c. 1384), traced their beginnings from the Greek prince [[Gathelus]] and his Egyptian wife [[Scota]], allowing them to argue superiority over the English, who claimed their descent from the Trojans, who had been defeated by the Greeks.<ref name=Kidd2003pp17-18/> The image of St. Andrew, martyred while bound to an X-shaped cross, first appeared in the Scotland during the reign of William I and was again depicted on [[Seal (emblem)|seals]] used during the late thirteenth century; including on one particular example used by the [[Guardians of Scotland]], dated 1286.<ref name='NAS'>[http://www.nas.gov.uk/about/051124.asp "Feature: Saint Andrew seals Scotland's independence"], ''The National Archives of Scotland'', 28 November 2007, retrieved 12 September 2009.</ref> Use of a simplified symbol associated with Saint Andrew, the [[saltire]], has its origins in the late fourteenth century; the Parliament of Scotland decreed in 1385 that Scottish soldiers should wear a white Saint Andrew's Cross on their person, both in front and behind, for the purpose of identification. Use of a blue background for the Saint Andrew's Cross is said to date from at least the fifteenth century.<ref>G.
