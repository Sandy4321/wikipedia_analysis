Starting his career as a professional model, he soon made his acting debut in the film ''[[Khushi (2000 film)|Khushi]]'' (2000), appearing in a cameo role. He further appeared in lead roles in critically and commercially successful films such as ''[[12B]]'', ''[[Iyarkai]]'', ''[[Ullam Ketkumae]]'' and the Telugu film ''[[Kick (2009 film)|Kick]]''. In 2006, he also made his debut in Kannada film through Tananam Tananam with [[Ramya]] and [[Rakshita]] directed by [[Kavitha Lankesh]].

== Early life ==
Shaam was born on 4 April 1978 in [[Madurai]], [[Tamil Nadu]],<ref name="telugucinema.com">{{cite web|url=http://www.telugucinema.com/c/publish/stars/interview_shaam_2009.php |title=Stars : Star Interviews : Excl: Interview with Shaam |publisher=Telugucinema.com |date= |accessdate=2010-06-25}}</ref> into a [[Tamil people|Tamil-speaking Muslim family]]. He grew up in [[Bangalore]], where he pursued his studies. After completing his [[Bachelor of Commerce|B. Com]], he did modelling through which he hoped to become an actor.<ref name="telugucinema1">{{cite web|url=http://www.telugucinema.com/c/publish/stars/interview_shaam_2009_3.php |title=Stars : Star Interviews : Excl: Interview with Shaam |publisher=Telugucinema.com |date= |accessdate=2010-06-25}}</ref>

==Career==
Shaam began his career as a model in [[Bangalore]], modelling for various ads. Keen on pursuing an acting career, he was vainly searching for acting offers for four years.<ref name="hinduonnet.com">{{cite news|url=http://www.hinduonnet.com/thehindu/mp/2003/11/24/stories/2003112400400100.htm |title=Sailing with SHAAM |last=Rangarajan |first=Malathi |date=2003-11-24 |accessdate=2010-06-28 |work=[[The Hindu]]}}</ref> He then, following the recommendation of his model coordinator, got to meet cinematographer [[Jeeva (director)|Jeeva's]], who was planning to make his directorial debut and was on the lookout for a new face for the film's lead role.<ref name="telugucinema.com">{{cite web|url=http://www.telugucinema.com/c/publish/stars/interview_shaam_2009.php |title=Stars : Star Interviews : Excl: Interview with Shaam |publisher=Telugucinema.com |date= |accessdate=2010-06-25}}</ref> Shaam was given the role for the film ''[[12B]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.telugucinema.com/c/publish/stars/interview_shaam_2009_2.php |title=Stars : Star Interviews : Excl: Interview with Shaam |publisher=Telugucinema.com |date= |accessdate=2010-06-25}}</ref> His second feature film, however, the [[S. J. Suryah]]-directed ''[[Khushi (2000 film)|Khushi]]'', in which he appeared in a cameo role, released first, since ''12B'' got stuck in production and released in 2001 only. The film, based on the theme of [[butterfly effect]], fetched rave reviews and was seen as a "dream entry" for Shaam.<ref name="hinduonnet.com"/> His subsequent releases including [[Vasanth]]'s ''[[Hey! Nee Romba Azhaga Irukke]]'' (2002), ''[[Bala (2002 film)|Bala]]'' (2002), ''[[Anbe Anbe]]'' (2003) and [[Priyadarshan]]'s ''[[Lesa Lesa]]'' (2003), garnered only average or poor box office returns.<ref name="rediff.com">{{cite web|url=http://www.rediff.com/movies/2005/nov/30shaam.htm |title=The ABCD of Shaam's life! |publisher=Rediff.com |date= |accessdate=2010-06-25}}</ref> His final release of 2003 was ''[[Iyarkai]]'' by debutant ''[[S. P. Jananathan]]'', which also failed at the box office due to a delayed release, but opened to high critical acclaim, even winning the [[National Film Award for Best Feature Film in Tamil]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hinduonnet.com/thehindu/fr/2004/08/27/stories/2004082701840100.htm |title=Honour well deserved |last=Rangarajan |first=Malathi |date=2004-08-07 |accessdate=2010-06-28 |work=The Hindu}}</ref>

Shaam's first 2005 release, ''[[Ullam Ketkumae]]'', again directed by Jeeva, finally was a commercial success again.<ref name="rediff.com"/>. In 2006, he acted in a Kannada film directed by [[Kavitha Lankesh]], with [[Ramya]] and [[Rakshita]], Tananam Tananam, an average grosser that released to mixed reviews. It fetched his co-star, [[Ramya]], her first Filmfare Award for Best Actress. She had described her role in the film as "little complex" and "challenging." Following several more unsuccessful films, he got a major break in the 2009 Telugu action film ''[[Kick (2009 film)|Kick]]''. He reprised the role in the Tamil remake, titled ''[[Thillalangadi]]''. Shaam tried his luck in Hindi with director [[Faisal Saif]] in the Hindi-Tamil bilingual titled ''Mujhe Maaf Karo''. But due to ego clash between the actor and director the film has been put on hold<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.deccanchronicle.com/hyderabad/%E2%80%98my-telugu-looks-sell%E2%80%99-094 |title=My Telugu looks sell<U+2019> |author=Special Corresspondent |date=2009-05-28 |accessdate=2010-06-25 |work=[[Deccan Chronicle]]}}</ref>

He was also a part of [[Mani Ratnam]]'s stage show, ''[[Netru, Indru, Naalai]]''.

==Personal life==
Shaam has three brothers and two sisters.<ref name="hinduonnet.com"/> He is married to a Punjabi, Kashish, who is his former collegemate.
