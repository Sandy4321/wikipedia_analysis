'''''Guitar Hero''''' is a [[music video game]] developed by [[Harmonix Music Systems]] and published by [[RedOctane]] for the [[PlayStation 2]] [[video game console]]. It is the first entry in the [[Guitar Hero|''Guitar Hero'' series]]. ''Guitar Hero'' was released on November 8, 2005 in North America, April 7, 2006 in Europe and June 15, 2006 in Australia. The game's development was a result of collaboration between RedOctane and Harmonix to bring a ''[[GuitarFreaks]]''-like game to America.

The game features a [[guitar]]-shaped [[game controller|controller]] (resembling a miniature [[Gibson SG]]) that the player uses to simulate the playing of [[rock music]]. The gameplay is similar to ''GuitarFreaks'', in that the player presses buttons on the guitar controller in time with [[musical notation|musical notes]] that scroll on the game screen. The game features covers of 30 popular rock songs spanning five decades of rock, from the 1960s up through 2005, in addition to bonus tracks. ''Guitar Hero'' became a surprise hit, earning critical acclaim and winning many awards from major video game publications. The game's success launched the ''Guitar Hero'' franchise, which has earned more than one billion [[United States dollar|dollars]] in sales, spawning several sequels, expansions, and other game-related products.

==Gameplay==
{{seealso|Guitar Hero#Gameplay|l1=Common gameplay elements in the Guitar Hero series}}
The gameplay is similar to other music and rhythm video games, in that the player must press buttons on a [[game controller]] in time with scrolling [[musical notation|note]]s on the game screen to complete a song.<ref name="manual"/> The basic mechanics are based on Konami's ''[[GuitarFreaks]]''.<ref name="ign review"/> In the case of ''Guitar Hero'', the player may use either the guitar peripheral (a 3/4-scale reproduction of the [[Gibson SG]] [[guitar]] as bundled with the game, or a third-party version) or a standard controller to play the scrolling notes.<ref name="manual"/> The guitar peripheral has five different-colored [[fret]] buttons near the [[nut (instrumental)|nut]] of the guitar neck, and a [[strum]] bar and a [[tremolo arm|whammy bar]] on the body of the guitar. The peripheral also has other buttons in order to navigate the game's menus. Music is displayed on screen through a series of notes, matching in color and position to the fret buttons, that scroll down the screen on a [[fingerboard|fret board]]. To hit or play a note, the player must hold down the fret button corresponding to the note shown and toggle the strum bar at the same time as that note passes a marked area on the screen. Faster series of notes may be played on the guitar controller using [[hammer-on]] and [[pull-off]] techniques where the player does not need to strum each note.  The game supports toggling the handedness of the guitar, allowing both left-handed and right-handed players to utilize the guitar controller.<ref name="manual">{{cite book | title = Guitar Hero instruction manual | year =2005 |publisher = RedOctane}}</ref> A player using the standard controller simply presses the buttons that correspond with the displayed notes as outlined in the game's manual.

The player is awarded points for correctly hitting notes, [[guitar chord|chord]]s and [[sustain]]s. The player can also increase a score multiplier by playing a series of consecutive notes successfully. A "Rock Meter" tracks the player's performance based on success or failure of hitting notes, and if the meter drops too low the song will prematurely end in failure for the player. The player can also earn "Star Power" by playing a series of glowing notes perfectly and using the whammy bar during sustains. Once the Star Power meter is filled at least halfway, Star Power can then be activated by briefly tilting the guitar controller vertically, or by pressing a specific button on a standard controller. Activating Star Power will double the scoring multiplier and makes it easier to increase the Rock Meter by playing correct notes. Thus, players can strategically use Star Power to play through difficult sections of a song they might have otherwise failed.<ref name="ign review"/>

===Modes and other features===
[[Image:Guitarhero-screen.jpg|right|thumb|225px|To play a note, the fret button and strum bar must be pressed when the solid note scrolls through the corresponding ring at the bottom. The interface shows the player's score and score multiplier (left), Star Power meter (right), and Rock Meter (bottom right).]]
''Guitar Hero''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s main mode of play is Career Mode, where the player and in-game band travel between various fictional performance arenas and perform sets of four or five songs. Completing songs in this mode unlocks the songs for play within the other game modes. Players can choose their on-stage character and their guitar; these elements have no effect on gameplay but affect the visuals during the performance. In Career Mode, players can earn money from their performances that is redeemable at the in-game store, where bonus content, such as additional songs, guitars and finishes, can be unlocked.<ref name="manual"/> Quick Play mode allows the player to play any unlocked track, selecting the difficulty, the character, venue and guitar.<ref name="manual"/> After successfully completing a song in either Career or Quick Play mode, the player is given a score and a rating between three-five stars, depending on his or her overall performance.<ref name="manual"/>

[[Multiplayer video game|Multiplayer]] mode offers two players the chance to compete against each other on the same song. Two fret boards will appear on screen, one for each player, as they alternate playing sections of the song in a dueling manner. The player with the highest score at the end of the song wins.<ref name="manual"/>

The four difficulty levels for each song afford the player a learning curve in order to help him or her progress in skill. The first difficulty level, Easy, only focuses on the first three fret buttons while displaying a significantly reduced amount of notes for the player to play. Medium introduces a fourth fret button while adding more notes, and Hard includes the final fret button while adding additional notes. Expert does not introduce any other frets to learn, but adds more notes in a manner designed to challenge the player.<ref name="manual"/>

==Development==
[[Image:Guitar-hero-controller.png|right|thumb|125px|The controller that was packaged with the game, an approximately 3/4-scale reproduction of a [[Gibson SG]]]]
According to Ron Kay, a developer with Harmonix, the idea of ''Guitar Hero'' was directly inspired by [[Konami]]'s ''[[GuitarFreaks]]'' arcade game, where the player used a guitar-shaped controller to interact with the game. At the time, ''GuitarFreaks'' had not seen much exposure in North America.<ref name="kay interview">{{cite book | last = Simons | first = Iain | title = Inside Game Design | publisher = Laurence King | date = 2007-09-27 | isbn = 1856695328 | page = 160 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/2801/book_excerpt_inside_game_design_.php | title = Book Excerpt: Inside Game Design: Harmonix Music Systems | publisher = Gamasutra | first = Iain | last = Simons | date = 2007-12-05 | accessdate = 2008-07-24 }}</ref>  RedOctane was making [[dance pad]]s for games like ''[[Dance Dance Revolution]]'' for home consoles and also operated an online video rental service similar to [[Netflix]].  RedOctane's Kai and Charles Huang recognized the popularity of ''GuitarFreaks'' in [[Japan]] through their rental service, and planned to create guitar controllers to bring the game to North America.<ref name="pd huangs"/>  The Huangs raised $1.75&nbsp;million for the effort, despite being turned down by some investors who "thought <nowiki>[</nowiki>the idea<nowiki>]</nowiki> was too weird".<ref name="pd huangs">{{cite web | url = http://blog.cleveland.com/pdextra/2008/03/guitar_hero_cofounders_turned.html | title ="Guitar Hero" co-founders turned a bright idea into $100&nbsp;million | publisher = ''[[Cleveland Plain Dealer]]'' | first = John | last = Petkovic | date = 2008-03-28 | accessdate = 2008-03-28}}</ref>  They approached Harmonix, who had previously made [[music video game]]s such as ''[[Frequency (video game)|Frequency]]'', ''[[Amplitude (video game)|Amplitude]]'' and ''[[Karaoke Revolution]]'' about making a guitar-based video game for those controllers. With a budget of about one million dollars (which Kay noted was "pretty tiny for a video game"), the two companies worked together to develop ''Guitar Hero''. Kay noted that "No one had any notions about it being a massive success; we all just thought it would be fun to do."<ref name="kay interview"/> Harmonix's president Alex Rigopulos also claims that former [[Microsoft]] vice-president of game publishing [[Ed Fries]] indirectly influenced the game's creation, who had previously told Harmonix when they were pitching ''Frequency'' to Microsoft that no music-rhythm game would succeed without custom hardware for it, prompting Rigopulos to investigate the ''Guitar Hero'' opportunity when it arose.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://g4tv.com/thefeed/blog/post/698333/Microsoft-Passed-On-Hamonixs-Frequency-Indirectly-Inspired-Guitar-Hero.html | title = Microsoft Passed On Harmonix's Frequency, Indirectly Inspired Guitar Hero | publisher = [[G4 TV]] | date = 2009-08-14 | accessdate = 2009-08-17 | first = Raymond | last = Padilla }}</ref>

The team quickly recognized that "the controller really was the kind of magic sauce for what we wanted to do".<ref name="kay interview"/>   They identified three aspects of gameplay that they felt made the game stand out. These aspects included the note-matching aspect and the showmanship created by the use of the whammy bar and tilting of the guitar within the game. The third key aspect was the use of Star Power "to provide a little more depth to the game&nbsp;<U+2014> some replay value, some interest for people as they were playing beyond just hitting the notes". <ref name="kay interview"/> Harmonix used third party controllers made for ''GuitarFreaks'' that were already on the market for development of the game until RedOctane had prepared prototypes for the ''Guitar Hero'' controller.<ref name="kay interview"/>  The controller initially had [[Pressure pad|pressure-sensitive]] fret buttons to mimic the playing of a real guitar, but the idea was dropped as it made the gameplay too complex.<ref name="mtv surprise hit">{{cite web | url = http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1518159/20051214/index.jhtml | title ='Guitar Hero': The Video Game That Literally Rocks | publisher = [[MTV]] | date = 2005-12-14 | accessdate = 2008-03-30 | first = Stephen | last = Totilo}}</ref>  The idea of using the whammy bar to boost Star Power, in addition to altering the [[pitch (music)|pitch]] of sustained notes was only realized about a month before the completion of the game.<ref name="mtv surprise hit"/> The team had spent "precious development time and resources" into creating a free-style model that would have allowed players to [[improvise]] during songs but ultimately cut it as they could not work the feature into the existing gameplay.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/4001/what_went_wrong_learning_from_.php | title = What Went Wrong?

"Gem tracks", the pattern of notes for a song, were developed by a team in Harmonix, taking usually a day to develop the tracks for one song.<ref name="kay interview"/>  Tracks were designed to include key notes to "make <nowiki>[</nowiki>the player<nowiki>]</nowiki> feel as if <nowiki>[</nowiki>he is<nowiki>]</nowiki> a brilliant musician".<ref name="kay interview"/> Software [[algorithm]]s were used to assess the difficulty of the tracks, and the quality assurance team helped to rebalance the tracks for accuracy and difficulty. The software also allowed Harmonix to quickly make changes to the set list or to recreate the tracks for a song to make sure the overall difficulty of the game was appropriate.<ref name="kay interview"/>

At the onset of development, the team did not have any idea of what songs would be present in the final game. Kay noted that "We wanted 30 or 40&nbsp;songs for the game and put a hundred on our wish list."<ref name="kay interview"/>   The game was to focus mostly on [[hard rock]] songs, but the team was limited by what could be [[license]]d. The team also felt "morally obligated" to include older, classic rock songs like [[The Ramones]]{{'}} "[[I Wanna Be Sedated]]" to the younger target audience of the game.<ref name="mtv surprise hit"/>   Harmonix had to modify the [[set list|track list]] throughout development as certain songs were introduced or removed based on licensing issues, requiring the team to repeatedly balance difficulty and popularity of the track list.<ref name="kay interview"/>  [[WaveGroup Sound]] were used to create the covers of the licensed songs provided in the game.<ref name="escapist wavegroup">{{cite web | url = http://www.escapistmagazine.com/news/view/78090 | title = WaveGroup Announces The Guitar Hero Recordings | publisher = ''[[The Escapist (magazine)|The Escapist]]'' | date =2007-10-17 | accessdate = 2008-03-25 | first = Andy | last = Chalk}}</ref> [[Marcus Henderson]] of the band Drist provided many of the lead guitar tracks for the covers.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.modernguitars.com/archives/001397.html | title = RedOctane's Guitar Hero: An Interview with Marcus Henderson | publisher = ''Modern Guitars Magazine'' | date = 2005-12-05 | accessdate = 2008-03-26 | first = Brian | last = Holland }}</ref> WaveGroup Sound also went to efforts to try to recreate effects for some songs.  In the case of [[Black Sabbath]]{{'}}s "Iron Man", the team learned that the vocal effects were created by having [[Ozzy Osbourne]] sing from behind a metal [[fan (mechanical)|fan]].  The team sought out the same model of fan through [[Craigslist]] to generate the same effect in the game's cover.<ref name="mtv surprise hit"/> Many of the bonus songs were from groups that Harmonix employees were part of or knew.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.blender.com/guide/articles.aspx?ID=2940 | title = Game On! | publisher = ''[[Blender (magazine)|Blender]]'' | month =November | year =2007 | accessdate = 2008-03-29 | first = David | last = Peisner}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.entdepot.com/features/interviews/article_1852.php | title = (Interview) Harmonix: Daniel Sussman, Guitar Hero and Maker of Magic Moments | date = 2006-11-10 | accessdate = 2008-03-23 | publisher = The Entertainment Depot | first = Ron |last=Ayers}}</ref> Additionally, a "Be a ''Guitar Hero''" contest was held allowing bands to submit their own song to be included in the game.

''Guitar Hero'' started with "super-basic ''Pong''-style graphics" for the game display.<ref name="kay interview"/>  The final game art was led by Ryan Lesser, using the art team's involvement in the music scene. Based on the experience from ''Frequency'' and ''Amplitude'', the team realized that "people don{{'}}t necessarily relate to really abstract visuals", and included the depictions of live performances as previously used in ''Karaoke Revolution''.<ref name="kay interview"/>  [[House of Moves]] were used to assist in creation [[motion capture]] for the on-screen animations.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.gamasutra.com/php-bin/news_index.php?story=7685 | title = Round-Up: iRiver G10, Aspyr Publishes Dreamfall, Guitar Hero Mocap | publisher = [[Gamasutra]] | date = 2006-01-06 | accessdate = 2008-03-26 | first = Nich | last = Maragos }}</ref>  The appearance of Star Power was made to resemble [[electricity]], both to reflect the use of the electric guitar as well to conceptually demonstrate the excitement of the performance and the virtual audience.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.gamesetwatch.com/2008/01/researching_guitar_hero_post_1.php | title = Researching Guitar Hero: The Creation Of The Original | publisher = [[Game Set Watch]] | date = 2008-01-24 | accessdate = 2008-08-21 | first = Kiri | last = Miller}}</ref>
