'''Chinameca''' (also known as '''El Pacayal''') is a volcano in central-eastern [[El Salvador]]. It lies north of [[San Miguel (volcano)|San Miguel volcano]] and rises over the town of [[Chinameca]].  The volcano is topped by a {{Unit km|2|1}} wide [[caldera]] known as Laguna Seca el Pacayal, and a [[satellite cone]] on the west side, Cerro el Limbo, rises higher than the caldera rim.  [[Fumarole]]s can be found on the north side, and it has been the site of a [[geothermal]] exploration program.
