'''''It's About Time''''' is the first CD Digital format album release by the [[California State University, Los Angeles]] Jazz Ensembles completed in 1990.   In addition to two big bands (1989/1990) the CD features the [[CSULA]] Jazz Sextet.   The jazz bands had numerous student musicians that have made a name for themselves as professionals to include [[Luis Bonilla]], [[The United States Military Academy Band, West Point, New York (CD album)|Jack Cooper]],  [http://www.coreygemme.com/_/Home_and_Schedule.html Corey Gemme], [http://alanparr.com/ Alan Parr], [http://www.parsec-santa.com/music/RandallWillis.html Randall Willis],  [http://www.orquestadengue.org/band_bio.html Paul De Castro], [[Big Bad Voodoo Daddy|Alex Henderson]], [[Street Signs (album)|Sheffer Bruton]], and [http://allmusic.com/artist/jose-arellano-p52352/credits Jos<U+00E9> Arellano].
== Background ==
In 1984 and 1985 the [http://www.calstatela.edu/academic/music/index.html California State University, Los Angeles Music Department] and CSULA Associated Students decided to fund LP recordings of the jazz ensemble to better serve as a teaching tool for student music, jazz groups.   ''It's About Times'' is the fifth of six albums to come from [[CSULA]] during the 1980s featuring the award winning [[CSULA]] #1 Jazz Ensemble.<ref>[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7bu0ghMkCY 1982 Playboy Jazz Festival winner], 1986 finals of the Pacific Coast Collegiate Jazz Festival, 1988 combo winner of the Pacific Coast Collegiate Jazz Festival, special invited performances at the 1987 MENC Convention in Seattle and the 1989 IAJE Convention in San Diego</ref>     The CD contains tracks from the #1 [[CSULA]] Jazz Ensembles of two successive years and a sextet to include compositions of five students and from the two directors (professors [http://www.unco.edu/arts/music/music_faculty/caffey.html David Caffey] and Jeff Benedict).   
 
There has been a consistent tradition of musicians coming from the [[CSULA]] program who have worked with major musical acts, on major studio and movie projects, and hold positions in higher education in music.   The roster on this album is self evident as to the diversity and level of student musicians [[CSULA]] developed at that time and has for many years dating far back to musicians (graduates) such as [[Lennie Niehaus]] and [[Gabe Baltazar]].
