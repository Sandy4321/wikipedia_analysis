'''Richard Taylor''' (January 27, 1826 &ndash; April 12, 1879) was a [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] [[General officer|general]] in the [[American Civil War]]. He was the son of United States [[President of the United States|President]] [[Zachary Taylor]] and [[First Lady of the United States|First Lady]] [[Margaret Taylor]].

==Early life==
Richard Taylor was born at the "[[Zachary Taylor House|Springfield]]" family estate near [[Louisville, Kentucky]]. He was named after his grandfather, [[Richard Taylor (colonel)|Richard Lee Taylor]], a Virginian who had served in the [[American Revolution]]. He had five siblings, named Ann Mackall Taylor, [[Sarah Knox Taylor]], Octavia Pannill Taylor, Mary Smith Taylor and [[Mary Elizabeth Bliss|Mary Elizabeth (Taylor) Bliss]]. Much of his early life was spent on the American frontier with his father Zachary, a [[United States Army]] officer. As a young man, he attended private schools in [[Kentucky]] and [[Massachusetts]]. Although starting his college studies at [[Harvard University]], he graduated from [[Yale University|Yale]] in 1845, where he was a member of [[Skull and Bones]].<ref name="skeleton">{{cite book | title=Fleshing Out Skull and Bones: Investigations into America's Most Powerful Secret Society | publisher=Trine Day | author=Millegan, Kris | year=2003 | location=Walterville, OR | pages=597<U+2013>690 | isbn=0972020721 | chapter=The Skeleton Crew}} "This list is compiled from material from the Order of Skull and Bones membership books at [[Sterling Library]], Yale University and other public records.  The latest books available are the 1971 ''Living members'' and the 1973 ''Deceased Members'' books. The last year the members were published in the ''[[Yale Banner]]'' is 1969."</ref>  He received no scholastic honors, but spent the majority of his time reading books on classical and military history. During the [[Mexican-American War]], Taylor served as the military secretary to his father.

His father sent Taylor away during the war because of his [[rheumatoid arthritis]]. He agreed to manage the family cotton plantation in [[Jefferson County, Mississippi]], and, in 1850, he persuaded his father (now President Taylor by virtue of his election in 1848) to purchase ''Fashion'', a large sugar plantation in [[St. Charles Parish, Louisiana]].

On February 10, 1851, Richard Taylor married Louise Marie Myrthe Bringier (d. 1875), a native of [[Louisiana]], daughter of a wealthy French creole matriarch Aglae Bringier, who would soon help them out financially after the freeze of 1856. Taylor and Marie Bringier would go on to have five children, two sons and three daughters; Richard, Zachary, Louise, Elizabeth, and Myrthe. His two sons, Richard and Zachary, both died during the war after contracting [[scarlet fever]], the loss of which hurt the elder Richard Taylor deeply.

After President Taylor's untimely death in July 1850, Taylor inherited ''Fashion''. Steadily he increased its area, improved its sugar works (at considerable expense), and expanded its labor force to nearly 200 slaves, making him one of the richest men in Louisiana. But the freeze of 1856 ruined his crop, forcing him into heavy debt with a large mortgage on the plantation.

==Politics==
In 1855, entered local politics when he was elected to the [[Louisiana Senate]], in which he served until 1861. He was first affiliated with the [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig Party]], then the American ([[Know Nothing]]) Party, and then finally the [[United States Democratic Party|Democratic Party]]. He was sent to the Democratic Convention in [[Charleston, South Carolina]] as a delegate from Louisiana and witnessed the splintering of the Democrats. While in Charleston, he tried to make a compromise between the two Democratic factions, but his attempts ultimately failed.

==Civil War==
When the Civil War erupted, Taylor was asked by Confederate [[Full General (CSA)|General]] [[Braxton Bragg]] to assist him, as a civilian, at [[Pensacola, Florida]]. Bragg had known Taylor from before the war, when the two had become friends. Bragg also was aware of Taylor's knowledge of military history and was eager to give him a job to help him organize and train the Confederate forces that were being sent there. Even though Taylor had been opposed to secession, he accepted. [[President of the Confederate States|Confederate President]] [[Jefferson Davis]] would later comment that the soldiers being sent from Pensacola were some of the best trained soldiers in the Confederacy. It was while he was serving there that Taylor was appointed [[Colonel (United States)|colonel]] of the 9th Louisiana Infantry, and served at the [[First Battle of Bull Run]]. The members of the 9th Louisiana voted for Taylor because they thought that with his connections with his brother-in-law Jefferson Davis, that the unit would be sent out sooner and see battle more quickly.

On October 21, 1861, Taylor was promoted to [[Brig. Gen. (CSA)|brigadier general]] and commanded a Louisiana brigade under [[Richard S. Ewell]] in the [[Jackson's Valley Campaign|Shenandoah Valley campaign]] and during the [[Seven Days Battles|Seven Days]]. Taylor was promoted over three more senior regimental commanders, and those commanders immediately thought that favoritism was involved because of Taylor's relationship with Jefferson Davis. Instead, Davis cited Taylor's leadership capabilities and the promise he showed, and that he was recommended for the promotion by [[Stonewall Jackson|General Jackson]] himself. During the Valley Campaign, Jackson used Taylor's brigade as an elite strike force that set a crippling marching pace and dealt swift flanking attacks. At the [[Battle of Front Royal]] on May 23, again at the [[First Battle of Winchester]] on May 25, and finally at the climactic [[Battle of Port Republic]] on June 9, he led the Louisianans in timely assaults against strong enemy positions.

His brigade consisted of various Louisiana regiments as well as Major [[Chatham Roberdeau Wheat]]'s [[Louisiana Tigers|"Louisiana Tiger" battalion]]. The assortment was an undisciplined lot that was known for its hard-fighting on the battlefield, but also for its hard-living outside of the battlefield. Taylor instilled discipline into the Tigers and although Major Wheat did not agree with how he did so, he nonetheless respected Taylor.

Taylor was promoted to the rank of [[Maj. Gen. (CSA)|major general]] on July 28, 1862, the youngest major general in the Confederacy at the time. He was ordered to [[Opelousas, Louisiana]], to conscript and enroll troops in the District of Western Louisiana, part of the Trans-Mississippi Department. [[John D. Winters]] wrote that Taylor was to "command all troops south of the [[Red River of the South|Red River]] and was to prevent the enemy from using the rivers and bayous in the area. Troops were to be gathered and sent to fill up the ranks of Louisiana regiments serving in Virginia. After this, Taylor was to retain as many recruits as would be needed in the state. Light batteries of artillery were to be organized to harass passing enemy vessels on the streams. ... The enemy was to be confined to as narrow an area as possible, and communications and transportation across the Mississippi River were to be kept open."<ref>Winters, p. 152</ref> 

After his service as a recruit officer in Louisiana, Taylor was given command of the tiny District of West Louisiana. He was sent to Louisiana after Governor [[Thomas Overton Moore]] had insistently requested a capable and dedicated officer to assemble the state's defenses and to help counter Federal forays into the state. Another reason for sending Taylor to Louisiana was attacks of [[rheumatoid arthritis]] which left him crippled for days at a time. During the Seven Days Battles, Taylor was so incapacitated that he was unable to leave his camp and command his brigade.

Before Taylor returned to Louisiana, Federal forces in the area had their way with much of southern [[Louisiana]]. During the spring of 1862, Union forces came upon Taylor's plantation, called Fashion, and plundered it. 

Taylor enjoyed the appointment, and the fact that he was to return to Louisiana, but found the district almost completely devoid of troops and supplies. However, he did the best with these limited resources by securing two capable subordinates, veteran infantry commander (Jean Jacques Alexandre) [[Alfred Mouton]], and veteran cavalry commander [[Thomas Green (general)|Thomas Green]]. These two commanders would prove crucial to Taylor's upcoming campaigns in the state.

During 1863, Taylor directed an effective series of clashes with [[Union Army|Union]] forces over control of lower Louisiana, most notably at [[Battle of Fort Bisland]] and the [[Battle of Irish Bend]]. These clashes were fought against [[Union Army|Union]] [[Major general (United States) | Maj. Gen.]] [[Nathaniel P. Banks]] for control of the [[Bayou Teche]] region in southern [[Louisiana]] and his ultimate objective of [[Port Hudson|Siege of Port Hudson]]. After Banks had successfully pushed Taylor's [[Army of Western Louisiana]] aside, he continued on his way to Port Hudson via [[Alexandria, Louisiana]]. After these battles, Taylor formulated a plan to recapture [[Bayou Teche]], along with the city of [[New Orleans, Louisiana]], and to halt the [[Siege of Port Hudson]].

===Operations to recapture New Orleans===
Taylor's plan was to move down the [[Bayou Teche]], capturing the lightly defended outposts and supply depots, and then capturing New Orleans, which would cut off [[Nathaniel P. Banks]]'s army from their supplies. Although his plan met with approval from [[Confederate States Secretary of War|Secretary of War]] [[James A. Seddon]] and President [[Jefferson Davis]], Taylor's immediate superior, [[Edmund Kirby Smith]], felt that operations on the Louisiana banks of the Mississippi across from Vicksburg would be the best strategy to halt the [[Siege of Vicksburg]]. From [[Alexandria, Louisiana]], Taylor marched his army up to Richmond, Louisiana. There he was joined with Confederate Maj. Gen. [[John George Walker|John G. Walker]]'s Texas Division, who called themselves "[[Walker's Greyhounds]]". Taylor ordered Walker's division to attack Federal troops at two locations on the Louisiana side of the Mississippi. The ensuing [[Battle of Milliken's Bend]] and [[Battle of Young's Point]] failed to accomplish the Confederate objectives. After initial success at Milliken's Bend, that engagement ended in failure after Federal gunboats began shelling the Confederate positions. Young's Point ended prematurely as well.

After the battles, Taylor marched his army, minus Walker's division, down to the Bayou Teche region. From there Taylor captured Brashear City ([[Morgan City, Louisiana]]), which yielded tremendous amounts of supplies, materiel, and new weapons for his army. He then moved within the outskirts of New Orleans, which was only being held by a few green recruits under Brig. Gen. [[William H. Emory]]. While Taylor was encamped on the outskirts and preparing for his attack against the city it was then that he received word that [[Port Hudson]] had fallen. He then withdrew his forces all the way back up Bayou Teche to avoid the risk of being captured.

===Red River Campaign===
In 1864, Taylor humiliated Union General [[Nathaniel P. Banks]] by defeating him in the [[Red River Campaign]] with a smaller force, commanding the Confederate forces in the [[Battle of Mansfield]] and the [[Battle of Pleasant Hill]]. He then pursued Banks back to the Mississippi River and for his efforts received the Thanks of the Confederate Congress. It was at these two battles that the two commanders Taylor had come to trust, respect, and rely on during his tenure in Louisiana, [[Brigadier general (United States)|Brigadier General]]s [[Alfred Mouton]] and [[Thomas Green (general)|Thomas Green]], were killed while leading their men into combat. On April 8, 1864, Taylor was promoted to [[Lieutenant General (CSA)|lieutenant general]], despite having asked to be relieved because of his distrust of his superior in the campaign, [[General (CSA)|General]] [[Edmund Kirby Smith]].

===Last days of the war===
Taylor was given command of the Department of Alabama and Mississippi and commanded the defenses around the city of [[Mobile, Alabama]]. After [[John Bell Hood]]'s disastrous [[Franklin-Nashville Campaign|campaign]] into [[Tennessee]], Taylor was given command of the [[Army of Tennessee]].<ref name=Eicher>Eicher, p. 523.</ref> He surrendered his department at [[Citronelle, Alabama]], the last major Confederate force remaining east of the [[Mississippi]], to Union General [[Edward Canby]] on May 8, 1865, and was paroled three days later.<ref name=Eicher/>

==Postbellum life==
After the war, Richard Taylor wrote his memoirs, ''Destruction and Reconstruction'', which is one of the most credited reports of the Civil War. He was active in Democratic Party politics, interceded on behalf of Jefferson Davis with President [[Andrew Johnson]], and was a leading political opponent of Northern [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction]] policies. He died in [[New York City]] and is buried in Metairie Cemetery, [[New Orleans]].

Most of Taylor's contemporaries, subordinates, and fellow generals make mention many times of his military prowess. [[Nathan Bedford Forrest]] commented that "He's the biggest man in the lot. If we'd had more like him, we would have licked the Yankees long ago." "Dick Taylor was a born soldier", asserted a close friend. "Probably no civilian of his time was more deeply versed in the annals of war." [[Stonewall Jackson]] and [[Richard S. Ewell]] frequently commented on their conversations with Taylor. Ewell stated that he came away from his conversations with Taylor more knowledgeable and impressed with the amount of information Taylor possessed.

==Family==
Richard Taylor was the only son of [[Margaret Mackall Smith]] and President [[Zachary Taylor]]. His sister [[Sarah Knox Taylor]] was the first wife of [[Jefferson Davis]] for three months in 1835. His other sister, [[Mary Elizabeth Bliss]], who had married [[William Wallace Smith Bliss]] in 1848, served as her father's White House hostess.

Although Richard chose to serve the Confederacy, his uncle, [[Joseph Pannell Taylor]], served on the opposite side as a Brigadier-General in the [[Union Army]].

==Honors==
The Lt. General Richard Taylor Camp #1308, Sons of Confederate Veterans in Shreveport, Louisiana, is named for General Taylor. The camp was chartered in 1971.
