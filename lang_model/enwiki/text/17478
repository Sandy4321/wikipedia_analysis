'''''SingStar Party''''' is a PlayStation 2 [[karaoke]] game published by Sony Computer Entertainment Europe and developed by [[SCEE]] and [[London Studio]] and proceeds the original ''[[SingStar]]'' game.  It was the second game released in the [[SingStar (series)|''SingStar'' franchise]].

''SingStar Party'', like the original game, is distributed either as the software alone, or bundled with a pair of USB microphones - one red, one blue. ''SingStar'' is compatible with the [[EyeToy]] camera, allowing players to see themselves singing.  

In 2005, ''SingStar'' and ''SingStar Party'' jointly received the award for originality at the [[BAFTA Games Awards]].

==Game Overview==

''SingStar Party'' is a popular karaoke game in which players sing to music videos in order to score points. Players interface with their PS2 via USB microphones while a music video plays on screen. Lyrics are shown at the bottom of the screen. ''SingStar'' matches a player's song voice to the original track, with players scoring points according to how accurate their singing is. Usually, two players compete simultaneously. Certain modes of ''SingStar Party'' may vary this basic pattern, but the principle is similar throughout.

Up to 8 players can participate in ''SingStar'''s "Pass The Mic" mode, in which teams of players face off against each other in a series of singing challenges.

Unlike the original ''SingStar'' game, ''Singstar Party'', and its successors, abandoned the single player career mode in favour of a multi-player mode.

''SingStar Party'', like all ''SingStar'' games, measure a player's pitch only, meaning that one can sing a ''SingStar'' note in any octave and still score for it. This allows some leniency for singers who may not be capable of singing a song in as high or as low a register as the original recording. 

''SingStar'' can be played at 3 difficulty levels - easy, medium, and hard. The harder the difficulty setting, the less leeway the game allows for out of tune notes.

Each ''SingStar'' version allows players to swap out the current disc (called the master disc) for another ''SingStar'' disc. This allows access to the songs on other versions without the need to reset the console. When a new disc is swapped in, the game retains the functionality and appearance of the master disc. By starting with a new version, players can swap in their old ''SingStar'' disc and experience them with the functionality and cosmetics of the master disc.

===Gameplay modes===

*Sing Solo - solo singing mode
*Collaborative Duet - duet for 2 players, combining scores
*Battle Mode - 2 player mode, singing together or in duet
*Pass The Mic Mode - multiplayer party games
