'''Stephen Carroll Gostkowski''' (pronounced "gust-OW-ski";<ref>{{cite web|url=http://library.kraftsportsgroup.com/20071001_pats_vs_bengals.pdf|title=Patriots vs. Bengals media notes|work=New England Patriots|date=2007-10-01|accessdate=2009-05-18}}</ref> the first 'K' is silent<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.seattlepi.com/football/300006_patriots17.html|title=Kicker fills Vinatieri's shoes nicely|work=[[Associated Press]]|publisher=[[Seattle Post-Intelligencer]]|first=Howard|last=Ulman|date=2007-01-17|accessdate=2009-05-18}}</ref>) (born January 28, 1984 in [[Baton Rouge, Louisiana]]) is a [[placekicker]] for the [[New England Patriots]] of the [[National Football League]] (NFL). He was drafted in the fourth round of the [[2006 NFL Draft]] with the 118th pick, one of just two kickers drafted, and the only rookie kicker to make an NFL roster that year. 

Gostkowski, who played both college football and [[baseball]] for the [[University of Memphis]], is the most accurate kicker in Patriots history, and one of the most accurate kickers in NFL history.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pro-football-reference.com/leaders/fg_perc_career.htm|title=Pro Football Reference: Career Field Goal Percentage|work=Pro-Football Reference|accessdate=2009-05-18}}</ref> He is also a consistent and prolific scorer: he is only the second player in NFL history to score 500 points in his first four seasons in the league.

==Early years==
Gostkowski graduated from [[Madison Central High School (Mississippi)|Madison Central High School]] in [[Madison, Mississippi]] in 2002. While there, he won four varsity letters each in football and soccer, and three in baseball, and was an All-State honoree in all three sports. Gostkowski holds the school record for longest field goal, a 55-yard kick. His teammates at Madison Central included current [[San Francisco 49ers|49ers]] [[linebacker]] [[Parys Haralson]] and [[Seattle Seahawks|Seahawks]] [[Center (American football)|center]] [[Christopher Clarks Spencer|Chris Spencer]]. His opponents included current [[Atlanta Falcons]] running back [[Jerious Norwood]], who returned one of Gostkowski's kickoffs from two yards deep in the end zone; Gostkowski raced him down at the 25-yard line to prevent a touchdown.

His most common nickname growing up was "Beaver"; he lost two front teeth playing hockey and had fake teeth that were too large put in as replacements.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.memphis.edu/magazine/v23i2/feat1.html|title=Double Play|work=[[University of Memphis]] Magazine|first=Greg|last=Russell|date=Spring 2005|accessdate=2007-02-11 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20061222180208/http://www.memphis.edu/magazine/v23i2/feat1.html <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2006-12-22}}</ref> While at Memphis, he was dubbed "Gotti" by Tigers head coach [[Tommy West]], because West couldn't pronounce Gostkowski correctly.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.boston.com/sports/football/patriots/articles/2006/08/24/hes_got_both_feet_out_door/?page=2|title=He's got both feet out door|work=[[The Boston Globe]]|first=Mike|last=Reiss|date=2006-08-24|accessdate=2007-06-10}} (Incidentally, the 'k' would not normally be silent in Polish.)</ref>

==College career==
Gostkowski attended the [[University of Memphis]] where he majored in Exercise and Sport Science. Gostkowski actually received a baseball scholarship at Memphis, and was a walk-on on the football team.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.baseballprospectus.com/unfiltered/?p=921|title=Kicking Around Some Baseball with Stephen Gostkowski|work=[[Baseball Prospectus]]|first=David|last=Laurila|date=2008-06-23|accessdate=2008-07-01}}</ref> He finished his college career with a total of 369 points, a school record, and 13th overall in NCAA Division I-A history, converting 70 of 92 [[Field goal (football)|field goals]] and 159 of 165 [[extra point]]s (PATs) during his Tiger career. His 70 FGs and 159 PATs both set school records previously held by Joe Allison (1990<U+2013>1993). He earned first team All-[[Conference USA]] honors in both his junior and senior years and was named Conference USA's Special Teams Player of the Year in 2005.

In 2005, his senior season, Gostkowski handled kickoff duties for Memphis, and had 39 [[touchback]]s on 68 kickoffs. Gostkowski did so using a one-inch tee (the height of NFL tees), rather than the two-inch tees allowed by the NCAA at the time. Thus, NFL talent scouts could more accurately project his potential.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.boston.com/sports/football/patriots/reiss_pieces/2006/05/tee_time.html|title=Tee time|work=Boston.com Reiss' Pieces|first=Mike|last=Reiss|date=2006-05-10|accessdate=2007-01-05}}</ref>

In a 2005 game against [[Houston Cougars football|Houston]], Gostkowski managed the rare feat of recovering his own [[onside kick]].

==Professional career==
===2006 season===
Gostkowski was drafted by the New England Patriots in the fourth round of the 2006 NFL Draft with the 118th pick. During the Patriots' 2006 training camp, he competed with veteran kicker [[Mart<U+00ED>n Gram<U+00E1>tica]], who the Patriots had signed as a free agent after [[Adam Vinatieri]] signed with the [[Indianapolis Colts]]. On August 23, 2006, before their third preseason game, the Patriots cut Gram<U+00E1>tica, and gave the job to rookie Gostkowski. (This is the reverse of what the makers of the video game ''[[Madden NFL 07]]'' expected; in the game, New England's place kicker is Gram<U+00E1>tica, not Gostkowski, who is listed as a free agent.) Since Gram<U+00E1>tica's release, Gostkowski has not faced any competition for his job.

During the 2006 preseason, Gostkowski was perfect on kicks and PATs, going 9-for-9 and 11-for-11, respectively, for a total of 38 points. His longest field goal was a 54-yard attempt against the [[New York Giants]] in the last preseason game.  On November 26, 2006, Gostkowski made the longest regular-season kick of his young career, a 52-yard kick against the [[Chicago Bears]], which is also the longest kick ever made at [[Gillette Stadium]]. Gostkowski finished the 2006 season as the highest-scoring rookie, with 103 points (20 field goals and 43 PATs), edging out the 96 points scored by [[Jacksonville Jaguars|Jacksonville]] [[running back]] [[Maurice Jones-Drew]].

While Gostkowski struggled early in his rookie season<U+2014>he had two consecutive kicks blocked<U+2014>Patriots reporters and fans have noted that his kickoffs are noticeably longer than were Vinatieri's in his last season in Foxboro. During the 2006 season, he averaged 65.5 yards per kickoff with a return average of 23 yards, and a total of 12 touchbacks. (By comparison, in 2005, Vinatieri's average kickoff was just 61.6 yards, though playing in a dome in 2006 he averaged 65.8 yards.) He also, somewhat surprisingly, did better overall on FG kicks than did opposing teams: while Gostkowski made 20 of 26 kicks, for a conversion rate of 76.9%, opposing kickers made just 22 of 30, for a conversion rate of just 73.3%. Gostkowski's rookie season was statistically about the same as Vinatieri's: Vinatieri converted 27 of 35 kicks (77.3%), but missed three PATs (39/42).

Gostkowski also had to contend with having three different holders during the season. After his first holder, punter [[Josh Miller]], was placed on injured reserve after week 11, the Patriots signed [[Ken Walter]], who held for weeks 12 to 15 until he too was placed on IR. Though the Patriots hired [[Todd Sauerbrun]] to punt, holding duties were given to the Patriots' backup quarterback [[Matt Cassel]] (which led to one regular-season kick that, while good, made two bizarre turns in mid-air).

====2006 postseason====
In the [[2006 New England Patriots season#Wild Card Round vs. New York Jets|AFC Wildcard Game]] of the 2006 postseason against the [[New York Jets]], Gostkowski was perfect on all his kick attempts, converting three field goal attempts (from 20, 40, and 28 yards) and four extra points. He also had one kickoff go through the back of the end zone (over 80 yards) for a touchback.

In the [[2006 New England Patriots season#AFC Divisional Round: at San Diego Chargers|AFC Divisional Playoffs]] against the [[San Diego Chargers]], Gostkowski made three of three field goals, including a 50-yard kick that was the longest successful kick in Patriots postseason history. He also made a 34-yarder in the third quarter and a 31-yard kick with 1:10 left in the fourth that made him only the third NFL rookie to attempt a game-winning playoff kick in the fourth quarter or overtime. (One of the others was Chargers kicker [[Nate Kaeding]], who missed his attempt in the 2004 playoffs; in this game, Kaeding missed a potential game-tying 54-yarder in the closing seconds.) Gostkowski also converted his only extra point attempt of the game following a [[Jabar Gaffney]] touchdown in the second quarter.

In the [[2006 New England Patriots season#AFC Championship: at Indianapolis Colts|AFC Championship]], Gostkowski again converted all of his kicks (two field goals and four PATs), and recorded two touchbacks on kickoffs, including one late in the fourth quarter after his second kick gave the Patriots a 34-31 lead.

====Expectations from the Vinatieri years====
As an untested rookie, Gostkowski faced special scrutiny in the playoffs, given the playoff heroics of Vinatieri.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/playoffs06/columns/story?columnist=smith_michael&id=2720072|title=Gostkowski among kickers under the microscope|work=[[ESPN.com]]|first=Michael|last=Smith|date=2007-01-04|accessdate=2007-01-04}}</ref> Gostkowski performed admirably, making all eight of his field goal kicks; he also recorded three touchbacks, including two in the Patriots' January 21, 2007 loss to the Colts at the [[RCA Dome]].

===2007 season===
Although Gostkowski ranked just 30th in field goal attempts through the first 12 weeks of the NFL season (16 attempts, 14 converted), he managed to equal his entire 2006 output in those 12 weeks, thanks to an NFL-leading 61 extra point attempts, all of which he converted. In Week 15, against the Jets, Gostkowski broke [[Uwe von Schamann]]'s record for most PATs converted in a season, with his 67th successful attempt. In Week 16, against the Dolphins, for whom von Schamann played, Gostkowski also had his 71st PAT attempt, breaking von Schamann's record of 70. Gostkowski finished the season with three more PATs against the [[New York Giants]] in Week 17 to finish a perfect 74-for-74 on PATs, eclipsing [[Jeff Wilkins]]' 1999 record of 64-for-64 with the [[St. Louis Rams]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nfl.com/history/randf/records/indiv/pat|title=NFL Individual Records: Points After Touchdown|work=NFL.com|accessdate=2007-12-29}}</ref> Gostkowski also went 21 for 24 on field goals to finish with 137 points on the season, the third-highest total of any player that year (rookie Green Bay kicker [[Mason Crosby]] had 141, and Patriots receiver [[Randy Moss]] had 138).

Gostkowski also had the distinction, in the Week 13 game against the [[Baltimore Ravens]], of kicking off from the Ravens' 35-yard line as the result of two [[unsportsmanlike conduct]] penalties on Ravens linebacker [[Bart Scott]] and an offside call on the Ravens defense on his PAT attempt. Gostkowski recorded a touchback on the kickoff, but there was confusion after the game as to whether or not the Patriots could have improved their field position by kicking the ball out-of-bounds instead.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.boston.com/sports/football/patriots/reiss_pieces/2007/12/kickoff_situati.html|title=Kickoff situation|work=[[Boston.com]]|date=2007-12-05|accessdate=2009-12-14 | first=Mike | last=Reiss}}</ref>

====2007 postseason====
Gostkowski only had two field goal attempts in the postseason, both in the divisional game against the [[Jacksonville Jaguars]]; Gostkowski converted one, but missed the other, his only failed postseason conversion. He was, however, perfect on his PAT attempts, going 9-for-9.

===2008 season===
Gostkowski was a key contributor in the Patriots' 19<U+2013>10 win over the [[New York Jets]] in Week 2, the game that marked Matt Cassel's debut as a starter. Gostkowski kicked 4 of 4 field goals from 21, 37, 28, and 27 yards, and recorded [[touchback]]s on the first five of his six kickoffs (the last kick was returned to the 20 before a [[Raymond Ventrone]] tackle).

In October, Gostkowski, after going 9-for-10 on field goals and 11-for-11 on PATs for a team-high 38 points, was named AFC Special Teams Player of the Month for the first time in his career.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.boston.com/sports/football/patriots/reiss_pieces/2008/10/gostkowski_afc.html|title=Gostkowski: AFC Special Teams Player of the Month|work=Boston.com Reiss' Pieces|first=Mike|last=Reiss|date=2008-10-30|accessdate=2008-10-30}}</ref>

In Week 16, Gostkowski had the highest-scoring game of his NFL career, converting 4 of 4 field goals, and 5 of 5 PATs. The 17-point performance gave him a total of 34 field goals on the season, breaking [[Tony Franklin (placekicker)|Tony Franklin]]'s 1986 franchise record of 32, and 141 points scored, tying Vinatieri's post-merger franchise record, with one game still to play. (Former wide receiver/kicker [[Gino Cappelletti]] scored 155 points for the Patriots in 1964, and 147 points in 1961, but those include 44 and 56 points on receptions.) Gostkowski finished the season with a league-leading 148 points, the 13th-highest single-season total in NFL history; his 36 field goals converted is the sixth-best total, and the most since [[Neil Rackers]] made 40 in 2005.

In December 2008 Gostkowski was selected for his first [[2009 Pro Bowl|Pro Bowl]] appearance as the [[American Football Conference|AFC]] kicker; his selection was the result of the players' and coaches' votes, as he did not finish in the top five in fan voting.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.boston.com/sports/football/patriots/articles/2008/12/17/peers_took_a_shining_to_stars/|title=Peers took a shining to stars|work=[[The Boston Globe]]|first=Mike|last=Reiss|date=2008-12-17|accessdate=2009-05-18}}</ref> The [[Associated Press]] also voted him to the [[2008 All-Pro Team|All-Pro]] First Team for the first time; he received 28 of the 50 votes for kicker.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nfl.com/news/story?id=09000d5d80dfd4f6|title=2008 All-Pro team|work=[[Associated Press]]|publisher=NFL.com|accessdate=2009-05-18}}</ref>

===2009 season===
[[File:Stephen Gostkowski and Eric Alexander.jpg|thumb|Gostkowski in October 2009]]
In the Patriots' last-minute 25<U+2013>24 victory over the [[Buffalo Bills]], Gostkowski recorded his first fumble recovery. When [[Leodis McKelvin]] fumbled the ball on a kickoff return, with the Patriots trailing 25<U+2013>19, Gostkowski recovered the ball at the Bills' 31-yard line. Tom Brady, describing the play in his postgame press conference, used yet another nickname for Gostkowski: "Meat,"<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.boston.com/sports/football/patriots/extra_points/2009/09/postgame_chatte.html#pats|title=Postgame chatter|work=Boston.com Extra Points blog|first=Chris|last=Forsberg|date=2009-09-15|accessdate=2009-11-25}}</ref> a reference to ''[[Bull Durham]]'', coined by former Patriots punter [[Josh Miller]] during Gostkowski's rookie season.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.boston.com/sports/football/patriots/articles/2006/07/29/for_kickers_time_to_replace_the_clutch/|title=For kickers, time to replace the clutch|work=[[The Boston Globe]]|first=Jerome|last=Solomon|date=2006-07-29|accessdate=2009-11-25}}</ref>

Gostkowski won his first AFC Special Teams Player of the Week award in the Patriots' Week 9 game against the [[Miami Dolphins]], in which he recorded four field goals and two [[touchback]]s, including one on a re-kick from the Patriots' 25-yard line following an [[Offside (American football)|offside]] penalty.

Gostkowski finished the season going 26-for-31 on field goals (83.9%). He was a perfect 47-for-47 on extra points and had a then-career-high 67.8 yard average on kickoffs.

===2010 season===
Gostkowski's rookie contract expired after the 2009 season, which normally would have made him an unrestricted free agent. As a result of the expiring NFL-[[National Football League Players Association|NFLPA]] [[collective bargaining agreement]], however, Gostkowski became a [[restricted free agent]]; the Patriots offered him the second-round tender of $1,759,000 for the 2010 season. Gostkowski signed the tender on April 17.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bostonherald.com/blogs/sports/rap_sheet/index.php/2010/04/17/patriots-kicker-stephen-gostkowski-signs-his-rfa-tender/|title=Patriots kicker Stephen Gostkowski signs his RFA tender|work=[[Boston Herald]]|date=2010-04-17|accessdate=2010-09-06}}</ref>

On August 26, 2010, the Patriots signed Gostkowski to a four-year extension. While he will play 2010 on his tender contract, the extension will give him $14 million from 2011 to 2014, with $5 million guaranteed.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/boston/nfl/news/story?id=5497799|title=Source: Patriots kicker gets extension|work=ESPNBoston.com|first=Mike|last=Reiss|date=2010-08-26|accessdate=2010-09-06}}</ref>

Gostkowski began the [[2010 New England Patriots season|2010]] season missing three of his first four field goal attempts over two games. However, in Week 4, against the Miami Dolphins, Gostkowski recorded five touchbacks in a single game; two weeks later, Gostkowski kicked his first overtime game-winning kick in the Patriots' [[2010 New England Patriots season#Week 6: vs. Baltimore Ravens|23<U+2013>20 victory]] over the [[2010 Baltimore Ravens season|Baltimore Ravens]].

In Week 9, Gostkowski was not able to finish the Patriots' game against the [[Cleveland Browns]] after sustaining a thigh injury; he was replaced by wide receiver [[Wes Welker]]. Three days later, on November 10, the Patriots placed Gostkowski on [[injured reserve]] with a torn [[quadriceps]] muscle, ending his season. The Patriots signed veteran kicker [[Shayne Graham]] to replace him.

Gostkowski finished the injury-shortened season 10-for-13 on field goals (76.9%; tying his career low set in 2006), while setting a career high with an average kickoff distance of 67.9 yards. He was 26-for-26 on his extra point attempts.
