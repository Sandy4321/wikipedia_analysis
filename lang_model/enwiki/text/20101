This rebirth of the Mini launched a new generation of Mini marque models, and led to the Mini winning the prestigious [[North American Car of the Year]] award in 2003.  Also while at BMW, Stephenson designed the [[BMW X5]].<ref name="cardesignnews.com">{{Cite web|url=http://www.cardesignnews.com/site/designers/whos_where/display/store4/item78586/|title=Who's Where: Frank Stephenson appointed Director of Design for Alfa Romeo|accessdate=2007-12-13|work=cardesignnews.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite book | title=Mini | author=Paterick C. Paternie | isbn= 0-7603-1157-9 }}</ref> 

In July 2002, Stephenson was appointed Director of Ferrari-Maserati Concept Design and Development. His work with Ferrari included the design of the [[Maserati MC12]] and [[Ferrari F430]].  He also oversaw [[Pininfarina|Pininfarina's]] work on the [[Maserati Quattroporte]] and [[Ferrari 612 Scaglietti]]. Stephenson success with Ferrari led to his appointed to head of the company's [[Fiat]], [[Lancia]], and Commercial Vehicle Styling Centre in [[Turin, Italy]] on February 22, 2005. He was tasked with rebuilding the struggling Fiat brand. While there, he directed the styling of the [[Fiat Punto|Punto]], [[Fiat Bravo/Brava|Bravo]], and new [[Fiat Nuova 500|Nuova 500]]. These three designs by Stephenson are credited with reviving Fiat sales and making the brand profitable again. On June 2007 he was made chief of [[Alfa Romeo]] style where he designed the award winning [[Alfa Romeo MiTo|MiTo]].<ref>{{cite news |title=Mclaren hires Frank Stephenson as new design director |author= Ireson, Nelson |url=http://www.motorauthority.com/news/1023267_mclaren-hires-frank-stephenson-as-new-design-director |newspaper= Motor Authority |date= 8 August 2008 |accessdate=22 March 2012}}</ref> He replaced [[Wolfgang Egger]], while [[Donato Coco]] took over his previous position at Fiat.

He left Fiat in April 2008 and took up the position of styling director at [[McLaren Automotive]] where he oversaw the design of the new [[MP4-12C]]. It is the first production car wholly designed and built by McLaren since the [[McLaren F1]] was discontinued in 1998, a 13 year hiatus. <ref name="quattroruote.it">{{Cite web|url=http://www.quattroruote.it/news/articolo.cfm?codice=130406|title= STEPHENSON SE NE VA E ARRIVA REITZ|accessdate=2008-03-31|work=quattroruote.it}} {{It icon}}</ref>

== Design Style ==
Stephenson says that he looks everywhere for inspiration and is always sketching. He adds that he is "never bored", and that just walking down the street one can find inspiration from "things on the sidewalk, the type of tiles, the paintings on the signs, there's always something to inspire you". His McLaren office is full of toys. Stephenson says of this: "that's the nature of any designer, you'll find they have a toy shop around".<ref name=Howtobuild/> He also says that he looks to the animal kingdom for design, using what's called [[biomimicry]]. Having a deep passion for biology and evolution, he tries to "find the principles in nature that makes products do what they look like they do".<ref name="CarsAndLife.net"/>    

Stephenson's process progresses from sketch pad, to [[Computer-aided industrial design|computer graphics]], to [[Industrial plasticine|clay models]], and finally test models. He says the advantage of working with clay is that you can feel the transitions and feel where there is too much surface or more surface needed. He suggests that you could almost design a car blind, because "you don't have to see it, you have to feel it, and by feeling it you feel if it's right or it's not right".
