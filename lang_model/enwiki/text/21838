The '''Walls of Dubrovnik''' are a series of [[defensive wall|defensive stone walls]] that have surrounded and protected citizens of the afterward proclaimed maritime [[city-state]] of [[Dubrovnik]] ([[Republic of Ragusa|Ragusa]]), situated in southern [[Croatia]], since city's founding before the 7th century as a [[Byzantium]] [[Castra|castrum]] on a rocky island named Laus (Ragusia or Lave).<ref group="Note">"''...city's founding before the 7th century as a Byzantium castrum on a rocky island named Laus...''"

== Former city walls ==
The construction of the first [[limestone]] forts around the city began in the early Middle Ages, towards the end of the 8th century. But, the "old chronicles" say that some sort of castle reliably existed on the Lave peninsula quite a long time prior to that.<ref name="diu"/> It is certain that the early town on Laus Island was also surrounded by defensive walls, probably mainly by wooden palisades.<ref name="croatiatraveller"/> The fact that Dubrovnik managed to survive a fifteen month-long invasion by the [[Saracen]]s in the 9th century proves how well the city was fortified.<ref name="LonelyPlanet"/>

The city first spread towards the uninhabited eastern part of the islet, which explains why the current name for the southeast part of the city, near St. John's Fortress, is called ''Pustijerna''.<ref name="sitiunescoadriatico"/> The name "Pustijerna" comes from the Latin statement "post terra", which means "outside the town".<ref name="sitiunescoadriatico"/>  In the 9th and 10th centuries, the defensive wall enclosed the eastern portion of the city.<ref name=sitiunescoadriatico>{{cite web | url=http://www.sitiunescoadriatico.org/index.php?pg=2077 | title=City Walls | work=Sitiunescoadriatico.org | publisher=[[Province of Ferrara]] | accessdate=2009-11-04}}</ref> When the sea channel separating the city from mainland was filled with earth in 11th century, the city merged with the settlement on land, and soon, a single wall was built around the area of the present-day city core.<ref name="sitiunescoadriatico"/> 

During this same time period, Dubrovnik and the surrounding area were described as a part of the [[Croats|Croatian]] (''Grwasiah'') entity, in one of the works by the "famous" [[Arab]] geographer [[Muhammad al-Idrisi]].<ref name=Oman>{{cite encyclopedia | author=G. Oman, Al-Idr<U+012B>s<U+012B> | encyclopedia=Encyclopaedia of Islam | edition=New | volume=3 | year=1971, reprinted 1986 | pages=1032<U+2013>35 | publisher=[[Brill Publishers]] | isbn=9004032754}}</ref> In his book ''Nuzhat al-Mushataq fi ikhtiraq al-afaq'' ([[English language|English]]: ''Joy for those who wish to sail over the world'') from 1154, he mentioned Dubrovnik as the southernmost city of "the country of Croatia and Dalmatia".<ref name="Oman"/><ref name=croatianhistory>{{cite web | url=http://www.croatianhistory.net/etf/et01.html | title=Croatia <U+2013> historical and cultural overview | work=Croatianhistory.net | first=Darko | last=Zubrinic | location=Zagreb  | year=1995 | accessdate=2009-11-04}}</ref> 

The basic city plan dates from 1292, when the port was rebuilt following a fire.<ref name="Britannica-Dubrovnik"/> The whole city was entirely enclosed in the 13th century, except for the [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] [[monastery]], which came under its protection later on, during the 14th century.<ref name=dubrovnik-guide>{{cite web | url=http://www.dubrovnik-guide.net/walls.htm | title=Dubrovnik City walls | work=Dubrovnik-guide.net | accessdate=2009-11-05}}</ref>

[[File:Dubrovnik, view on Old town from Minceta tower, Croatia.JPG|right|thumb|200px|View on Old town from Min<U+010D>eta Tower, the city's most prominent point.]]
The city walls have been preserved to the present day, not only because of the knowledge of the skilled construction workers and the constant care provided by city dwellers that maintained and rebuilt the structures as needed, but also because of the brilliantly reputed diplomacy in Dubrovnik, which managed on many occasions to avoid dangerous measures taken by enemies against the Dubrovnik Republic.<ref name="sitiunescoadriatico"/>

The present shape of the walls was defined in the 14th century after the city gained its full independence from [[Republic of Venice|Venetian]] suzerainty, but the peak of its construction lasted from the beginning of the 15th century until the latter half of the 16th century.<ref name="diu"/> Being constructed very solidly, the walls were generally unaffected by a [[1667 Dubrovnik earthquake|strong earthquake occurring in 1667]].<ref name="diu"/>
The largest stimulus for continued development and emergency repairs and works of the Dubrovnik fortresses came as a result of the danger of unexpected attack by [[Ottoman Empire|Turkish]] military forces, especially after they conquered [[Constantinople]] in 1453.<ref name=JamesStewart>{{cite book | last=Stewart | first=James | pages=285<U+2013>293 | url=http://books.google.com/books?id=KIhFr8klMowC&pg=PA287&dq=walls+of+Dubrovnik&lr=&as_brr=3&hl=hr#v=onepage&q=walls%20of%20Dubrovnik&f=false | title=Croatia | publisher=Cadogan Guides | year=2006 | isbn=1860113192}}</ref>
The city was also under latent danger of attack by the Venetians.<ref name="diu"/> For centuries the people of Dubrovnik were able to preserve their city-republic by skillful maneuvering between [[Eastern world|East]] and [[Western world|West]]. A strategic treaty with Turkey protracted Dubrovnik<U+2019>s liberty and maintained the opportunity for a major trading role between the [[Ottoman Empire]] and Europe.<ref name="Britannica-Dubrovnik"/>

The irregular parallelogram surrounding Dubrovnik, consists four strong fortresses at its most significant points.<ref name="sitiunescoadriatico"/> To the north is the strong circular Min<U+010D>eta Tower, to the east side of the city port is the Revelin Fortress, the western city entrance is protected by the strong and nicely-shaped Fort Bokar, the strong, freestanding St. Lawrence Fortress (also known as [[Lovrijenac]]) protects the western side of the city from possible land and sea assaults, and the large and complex of St. John Fortress is located on the southeast side of the city.<ref name="sitiunescoadriatico"/>

=== Land Walls ===
The main wall on the landside is four to six meters (13<U+2013>20&nbsp;feet) thick, and, at certain locations, the walls reach up to 25 meters (80&nbsp;feet) in height.<ref name="JamesStewart"/>
The land walls stretch from Fort Bokar in the west to the detached Revelin Fortress in the east.<ref name="geographica"/> On the landside, the wall is protected with an additional range of slanted supporting walls as defense against artillery fire, especially against possible Ottoman attacks.<ref name="JamesStewart"/><ref name=RobinHarris>{{cite book | first=Robin | last=Harris | year=2003 | title=Dubrovnik, A History | publisher=Saqi Books | isbn=0-86356-332-5}}</ref>

==== Gates ====
The town has four city gates: two that lead to the harbor and two (with drawbridges) that lead to the mainland.<ref name=gulet>{{cite web | url=http://www.gulet-croatia.info/destinations/dalmatia-dubrovnik/Dubrovnik.asp | title=Dubrovnik | work=Gulet-croatia.info | publisher=ADRIA travel | accessdate=2009-11-05}}</ref> During the time period when the [[Austrian Empire]] controled the city, two more gates were opened in the wall.<ref name="gulet"/>

Communication with the outside world on the landside was maintained with the city through two main well-protected city [[gate]]s, one placed on the western side of the city and the other placed on the eastern side.<ref name="sitiunescoadriatico"/> These entrances were constructed so that communications with the city could not be carried out directly; the messenger had to enter through multiple doors and walk down a winding passageway, which is evidence of the security measures taken as a last defense against the possibility of a surprise breach or entrance of unexpected visitors.<ref name="sitiunescoadriatico"/>

===== Gate of Pila =====
The Pila Gates are a well-fortified complex, with multiple doors, and defended by Fort Bokar and the [[moat]] that ran around the outside section of the city walls.<ref name="sitiunescoadriatico"/> At the entrance gate to the Old Town, on the western side of the land walls, there is a stone bridge between two [[Gothic architecture|Gothic arches]], which were designed by the esteemed architect [[Paskoje Mili<U+010D>evi<U+0107> Mihov|Paskoje Mili<U+010D>evi<U+0107>]] in 1471.<ref name=dubrovnik-online>{{cite web | url=http://www.dubrovnik-online.com/english/monuments.php | title=Monuments of Dubrovnik | work=Dubrovnik-online.com | publisher=Dubrovnik Online | accessdate=2009-11-05}}</ref> That bridge connects to another bridge, a wooden [[drawbridge]] which can be pulled up.<ref name="dubrovnik-online"/> During the republican era, the wooden drawbridge to the Pila Gate was hoisted each night with considerable pomp in a ceremony which delivered the city's keys to the Ragusan [[rector]].<ref name="JamesStewart"/> Today, it spans a dry moat whose garden offers respite from crowds.<ref name="JamesStewart"/> Above the bridges, over the arch of town's principal gateway, there is a statue of city patron [[Saint Blaise]] ({{lang-hr|Sveti Vlaho}}), with a model of the [[Renaissance]] city.<ref name="JamesStewart"/> After passing the Pile Gate's original [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] inner gateway, it is possible to reach one of a three access points to the city walls.<ref name="JamesStewart"/>

===== Gate of Plo<U+010D>a =====
On the eastern side of the land walls, stands the second major entrance to the city, the Gate of Plo<U+010D>a. This gate is protected by the freestanding Revelin Fortress, which are connected by a wooden drawbridge and a twin-spanned stone bridge spanning a protective ditch.<ref name="sitiunescoadriatico"/><ref name="dubrovnik-guide"/> The Outer Gate of Plo<U+010D>a was designed and constructed by architect [[Mihajlo Hranjac]] in 1628, while the two bridges to the Revelin Fortress were built in 15th century by Paskoje Mili<U+010D>evi<U+0107>.<ref name="dubrovnik-online"/> Mili<U+010D>evi<U+0107> was also designed the Pila Gate bridges, which explains the similarities between the bridges.<ref name="dubrovnik-online"/> Over the bridge, just like with the Gate of Pila, there is the statue of Saint Blaise, the patron saint of Dubrovnik.<ref name="dubrovnik-online"/>

===== Gate of Bu<U+017E>a =====
The Gate of Bu<U+017E>a (meaning "hole") is located on the northern side of the land walls. This gate is relatively new compared to the other gates, as it was constructed during the early 1900s.<ref name=Bradtguide>{{cite book | first1=Piers | last1=Letcher | first2=Robin | last2=McKelvie | first3=Jenny | last3=McKelvie | pages=145<U+2013>146 | url=http://books.google.hr/books?id=JM6TwY9_1ZkC&pg=PA146&lpg=PA146&dq=Gate+of+Buza&source=bl&ots=aJ53-JTtsY&sig=4OEWfsQWrQFPdfrSY94adjD9csc&hl=hr&ei=nkrDSsj8DYmlsAa6wbC2BA&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=4&ved=0CBUQ6AEwAzgK#v=onepage&q=Gate%20of%20Buza&f=false | title=Dubrovnik | publisher=[[Bradt Travel Guides]] | edition=2nd | month=May | year=2007 | origyear=2005 | isbn=978 1 84162 191 3}}</ref>

=== Sea Walls ===
The main wall on the sea-facing side of Dubrovnik stretches from Fort Bokar in the west, to St. John Fortress in the south, and to the Revelin Frotress on the land-side.<ref name="geographica"/> These walls are 1.5 to 5 meters (5<U+2013>16&nbsp;feet) thick, depending on their location and its strategic importance.<ref name="geographica"/> The purpose of these walls were help defend the city from sea-based attacks, particularly from the Republic of Venice, which was often considered a threat to Dubrovnik's safety.<ref name="RobinHarris"/>

==== City Harbour ====
One of the oldest sectors of Dubovnik was constructed around a  [[Late Antiquity|Late Antique]] castle by the sea, which stretched landwards a bit more than it does today.<ref name=tzdubrovnik>{{cite web | url=http://www.tzdubrovnik.hr/what_to_see.php?id=1244 | title=The City Harbour | work=Tzdubrovnik.hr | publisher=Dubrovnik Tourist Board | accessdate=2009-11-05}}</ref>  It was constructed on the site of the [[Pre-Romanesque art and architecture|Pre-Romanesque]] [[cathedral]] and the Rector's Palace, thus encircling the city's harbour.<ref name="tzdubrovnik"/> The harbour was designed and constructed by engineer Paskoje Mili<U+010D>evi<U+0107> in late 15th century.<ref name="tzdubrovnik"/> Notably, the harbour was noticeably painted on the palm of St. Blaise in a [[triptych]] painted by the artist [[Nikola Bo<U+017E>idarevi<U+0107>]] around 1500.<ref name="tzdubrovnik"/>

The most prominent portion of the harbour are the three enormous arches (the fourth original arch was walled in) of a large [[arsenal]] built in the late 12th century and enlarged in the latter part 15th century.<ref name="tzdubrovnik"/> The harbour is also the oldest [[shipyard]] within the city and is still in use today.<ref name="tzdubrovnik"/>

Porporela was built in 1873, next to St. John Fortress.<ref name="tzdubrovnik"/> The Kase jetty ([[Breakwater (structure)|Ka<U+0161>e Breakwater]]) was built in 1485, according to the design of Paskoje Mili<U+010D>evi<U+0107>, in order to defend the harbour and protect it from south-eastern winds and waves.<ref name="tzdubrovnik"/> The breakwater thus shortened the harbour's bulky chain stretched in the night from the St. John Fortress to St. Luke's tower. It was constructed of huge stone blocks laid over wooden foundations without [[Binder (material)|binder]].<ref name="tzdubrovnik"/>

Today, the arsenal hosts the City Caf<U+00E9> and a movie theatre, whereas both the harbour and Porporela have become pleasant promenades and tourist attractions.<ref name="tzdubrovnik"/>

==== Gates ====
In the city port area, one of the most significant areas of the maritime trade city, there were two entrances: Gate of Ponte (port) and the Fishmarket Gate.<ref name="sitiunescoadriatico"/> The entire layout of the Dubrovnik streets, as well as a range of expansions, was intended for fast and effective communication with the forts of the city walls.<ref name="sitiunescoadriatico"/>

===== Gate of Ponte =====
Constructed in 1476, the Gate of Ponte is situated westwards from the Great Arsenal.<ref name="tzdubrovnik"/> The city wall, built at the same period, leads from the Gate to St. John Fortress.<ref name="tzdubrovnik"/> The present-day street of Damjan Juda was formed in the 15th century, when the sewage system was completed, and building of houses against the western city wall was no longer allowed.<ref name="tzdubrovnik"/>

===== The Fishmarket Gate =====
The Fishmarket Gate, built in 1381, stands eastward from the Great Arsenal. The three arches of the 15th century Small Arsenal, where small boats were repaired, are situated a bit further.<ref name="tzdubrovnik"/> The old tower of St. Luke<U+2019>s protects the harbour in the east, and the harbour entrance is encircled and guarded by Revelin Fortress.<ref name="tzdubrovnik"/>

=== Forts within walls ===
The [[fall of Constantinople]] in 1453 was a clear sign to the cautious citizens of Dubrovnik to quickly take ample defensive measures, the first and one of the most important being the strengthening of its defensive structures. The fall of [[Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnia]], which followed soon in 1463, only hastened the works. As a result, the Republic invited an architect, [[Michelozzo|Michelozzo di Bartolomeo of Florence]], to direct the improvement of the city's defenses. His work in Dubrovnik resulted in the construction and expansion numerous buildings of key importance for the defense of Dubrovnik.<ref name="dubrovnik-guide"/>

==== Min<U+010D>eta Tower ====
The Min<U+010D>eta Tower is the most prominent point in the defense system toward the land. The tower's name derives from the name of the [[House of Men<U+010D>eti<U+0107>|Men<U+010D>eti<U+0107> family]], who owned the ground the tower was built upon.<ref name="dubrovnik-guide"/> By its height and impressive volume the tower dominates the northwestern high part of the city and the walls.<ref name="dubrovnik-guide"/> Min<U+010D>eta Tower was build by a local builder [[Nicifor Ranjina]] in 1319, originally as a strong four-sided fort.<ref name="dubrovnik-guide"/> In the middle of the 15th century, around the earlier quadrilateral fort, Michelozzo built a new round tower adapted to the new technique of warfare and joined it to the new system of low [[Counterscarp|scarp walls]]. The walls of the new tower were full 6 meters (20&nbsp;feet) thick and had a series of protected gun ports. The architect and sculptor [[Giorgio da Sebenico]] of [[Zadar]], continued the work on the Min<U+010D>eta. He designed and built the high narrow round tower, while the [[battlement]]s are a later addition. The tower was completed in 1464, and is the symbol of the unconquerable city of Dubrovnik.<ref group="Note">"''...symbol of the unconquerable city of Dubrovnik.''" Dubrovnik citizens surrendered to the French army in 1806, by permiting thear entrance into city. Although, Dubrovnik was not conquered by France in war, two years later, in 1808, Marshal Auguste de Marmont abolished the Republic of Ragusa and amalgamated its territory into the French Illyrian Provinces.</ref><ref name="dubrovnik-guide"/> Since it is the highest point of the wall, it is considered to offer a seemingly "unforgettable" view on the city.<ref name="dubrovnik-guide"/>

==== Fort Bokar ====
The Fort Bokar, often called the "Zvjezdan", is considered to be amongst the most beautiful instances of harmonious and functional fortification architecture.<ref name="dubrovnik-guide"/> It was built by Michelozzo, while the city walls were reconstructed (from 1461 to 1463).<ref name="dubrovnik-guide"/> This fort was conceived as the key point in the defense of the Pila Gate, the western fortified entrance of the city.<ref name="dubrovnik-guide"/> After Min<U+010D>eta Tower, this fort is the second key point in the defense of the western land approach to the city.<ref name="dubrovnik-guide"/> It was built as a two-story casemate fortress, standing in front of the medieval wall face protruding into space almost with its whole cylindrical volume.<ref name="dubrovnik-guide"/> It is said to be the oldest casemented fortress in Europe, which contains a small lapidary collection and numerous cannons.<ref name="dubrovnik-online"/>

==== St. John Fortress ====
The St. John Fortress ({{lang-hr|Sveti Ivan}}), often called Mulo Tower, is a complex monumental building on the southeastern side of the old city port, controlling and protecting its entrance. The first fort was built in mid 14th century, but it was modified on several occasions in the course of the 15th and 16th centuries, which can be seen in the triptych made by the painter Nikola Bo<U+017E>idarevi<U+0107> in the Dominican monastery.<ref name="dubrovnik-guide"/> The painting shows Saint Blaise, the patron saint of Dubrovnik.<ref name="dubrovnik-guide"/> Dominant in the port ambiance, the St. John Fortress prevented access to [[Piracy|pirates]] and other enemy ships.<ref name=bestindubrovnik>{{cite web | url=http://www.bestindubrovnik.com/must_see/4/default.aspx# | title=The Old Port | work=Bestindubrovnik.com |accessdate=2009-11-05}}</ref> Always cautious at the first sign of danger, the inhabitants of Dubrovnik used to close the entry into the port with heavy [[chain]]s stretched between the fortress the St. John Fortress and Kase jetty, and they also used to wall up all the port entrances of the Great Arsenal.<ref name="bestindubrovnik"/>

Today, the fortress houses an [[aquarium]] on the ground floor, stocked with fishes from various parts of the Adriatic Sea. On the upper floors there is an [[Ethnography|ethnographic]] and a [[maritime museum]], in which the four sections are devoted to the Republic Maritime Period, the Age of Steam, the [[Second World War]], and to the techniques of sailing and navigation.<ref name="dubrovnik-online"/>

=== Detached forts ===
==== Revelin Fortress ====
In the period of unmistakable Turkish danger and the fall of Bosnia under Turkish rule, the Revelin Fortress was built to the east of the city in 1462, a detached fortress providing additional protection to the land approach to the eastern Plo<U+010D>e Gate.<ref name="dubrovnik-guide"/> The name derives from rivelino (ravelin), a term in military architecture, which refers, to work built opposite to the city gate in order to afford better protection from enemy attack.<ref name="dubrovnik-guide"/> Danger of Venetian assault suddenly increased in the times of the First [[Holy League]], and it was necessary to strengthen this vulnerable point of the city fortifications. The Senate hired Antonio Ferramolino, an experienced builder of fortresses in the service of the [[Spain|Spanish]] admiral Doria, a trusted friend of the Republic. In 1538 the Senate approved his drawings of the new, much stronger Revelin.<ref name="dubrovnik-guide"/> It took 11 years to build it, and during that time all other construction work in the city had stopped in order to finish this fortress as soon as possible.<ref name="dubrovnik-guide"/>

The new Revelin became the strongest city fortress, safeguarding the eastern land approach to the city. It is an irregular quadrilateral, with one of its sides descending towards the sea, and protected by a deep ditch on the other side. One bridge crossing the protective ditch connects it to the Plo<U+010D>e Gate, and another connects it to the eastern suburb. The construction work was executed perfectly so that the devastating [[1667 Dubrovnik earthquake|earthquake of 1667]] did not damage Revelin.<ref name="dubrovnik-guide"/> As its interior is divided into 3 large vaulted rooms, Revelin became the administration center of Republic.<ref name="dubrovnik-guide"/>

==== St. Lawrence Fortress ====

St. Lawrence Fortress ({{lang-hr|Lovrijenac}}), often called Dubrovnik's Gibraltar, is located outside the western city walls, 37 m (121&nbsp;feet) above sea level.<ref name=timemert>[http://www.timemert.com/family.htm Dubrovnik] Tim Emert. Retrieved 2009-11-05.</ref> The fortress has a quadrilateral court with mighty arches. As the height is uneven, it has 3 terraces with powerful parapets, the broadest looking south towards the sea. Lovrijenac was defended with 10 large cannons, the largest and most famous being <U+201C>Lizard<U+201D> ({{lang-hr|Gu<U+0161>ter}}). The walls exposed to enemy fire are almost 12 meters (39&nbsp;feet) thick, but the large wall surface facing the city does not exceed 60 [[centimetre]]s (2&nbsp;feet).<ref name="dubrovnik-guide"/> Two [[drawbridge]]s lead to the fort and above the gate there is an inscription "Non Bene Pro Toto Libertas Venditur Auro"&nbsp;<U+2013> "Freedom is not to be sold for all the treasures in the world".<ref name="dubrovnik-guide"/> To ensure loyalty, the troops in St. Lawrence Fortress were rotated every 30 days. To ensure complete loyalty, they were given only 30 days of rations, when they went in to the fort.<ref name="timemert"/> According to old scripts it was built in only three months.<ref name="dubrovnik-online"/>

Today its interior is one of the most dignified stages in Europe, a well-known place for [[William Shakespeare's Hamlet]] performances.<ref name="dubrovnik-online"/>
