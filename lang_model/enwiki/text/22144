"'''Synchrony'''" is the nineteenth episode of the [[The X-Files (season 4)|fourth season]] of the American science fiction television series ''[[The X-Files]]''. It was written by [[Howard Gordon]] and [[David Greenwalt]] and directed by James Charleston. The episode aired in the United States on April 13, 1997 on the [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] network. The episode is a [[List of Monster-of-the-Week characters in The X-Files|"Monster-of-the-Week"]] story, a stand-alone plot which is unconnected to the series' wider [[Mythology of The X-Files|mythology]]. "Synchrony" earned a [[Nielsen rating]] rating of 11.3, being watched by 18.09 million people upon its initial broadcast. The episode received mixed to positive reviews from television critics.

The show centers on [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] special agents [[Fox Mulder]] ([[David Duchovny]]) and [[Dana Scully]] ([[Gillian Anderson]]) who work on cases linked to the paranormal, called [[X-File]]s. In this episode, Mulder and Scully investigate a murder for which the suspect presents an incredible alibi <U+2014> that the death was foretold by an old man able to see into the future. Upon investigating the case, the duo discover an increasingly bizarre series of events that leads Mulder to believe [[time travel]] is involved.

Gordon and Greenwalt wrote the episode after being inspired by an article in ''[[Scientific American]]'' about time travel and [[quantum physics]]. The idea of a scientist trying to stop the invention of something terrible was inspired by [[Manhattan Project]] physicist [[J. Robert Oppenheimer]], who complained to [[Harry S. Truman]] about the [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|1945 atomic bombings of Japan]].

==Plot==
[[Cryogenics]] researchers Jason Nichols ([[Joseph Fuqua]]) and Lucas Menand ([[Jed Rees]]) become embroiled in an argument as they walk down a city street. They are approached by an old man ([[Michael Fairman]]), who warns Menand that he will be run over by a bus at 11:46 pm that evening. After the man is arrested by campus security, his prophecy is proven true when Menand is run over by a bus and killed.

[[Fox Mulder]] ([[David Duchovny]]) and [[Dana Scully]] ([[Gillian Anderson]]) investigate the case, learning that Jason was taken into custody after the bus driver told police that he pushed Menand into the path of his vehicle. However, Nichols tells authorities that he was trying to save Menand. The security guard who arrested the old man is found frozen to death after exposure to a chemical [[refrigerant]]. Mulder interviews Jason, who explains Menand threatened to go public with a claim that Jason had falsified data on a research paper.

The old man kills Dr. Yonechi ([[Hiro Kanagawa]]), a Japanese researcher, by pricking him with a metallic stylus, introducing an unknown chemical into his body. The agents approach Nichols' girlfriend and colleague, Lisa Ianelli ([[Susan Lee Hoffman]]), who recognizes the chemical compound as a rapid freezing agent that Jason had been engineering for years. However, she claims that the compound has not yet been invented and that if Yonechi was injected with the chemical, he may not be dead. With Lisa's help, Scully and a team of medical personnel successfully resuscitate Yonechi, only for his body temperature to rapidly increase until he [[spontaneous human combustion|bursts into flames]]. Police receive a tip that the old man is living at a nearby hotel. Inside the old man's room, the agents discover a faded color photograph picturing Jason, Yonechi and Lisa toasting champagne glasses in the cryology lab. Mulder realizes from the picture that the old man is a [[time travel|time traveller]] who is attempting to alter that future, and that he is none other than Jason Nichols.

Lisa locates the elderly man and confronts him, however he injects her with the chemical. Scully successfully resuscitates Lisa. Jason confronts his elderly self in the computer mainframe room at the cryogenic lab, where the old man has erased all of Jason's files from the computer. The old man tells Jason that the success of their research made time travel possible, but also plunging the world into chaos. Jason lunges at the old man, choking him. Wrapping his arms around his younger self, the old man [[spontaneous human combustion|bursts into flames]], and the fire consumes them both. Later, Lisa sets to work at cryonics lab, attempting to reconstruct the chemical compound.<ref name=plot/>

==Development==
[[File:Howard Gordon by Gage Skidmore.jpg|upright|thumb|The concept of the episode originated from [[David Greenwalt]] and [[Howard Gordon]]'s (''pictured'') idea to write an episode about time travel.]]

After [[Howard Gordon]] and [[Chris Carter (screenwriter)|Chris Carter]] finished their work on "[[Unrequited (The X-Files)|Unrequited]]", Carter introduced Gordon to [[David Greenwalt]], who had been added to ''The X-Files'' producers, and asked the duo to create a script for an upcoming episode. Gordon and Greenwalt got together in [[Simi Valley, California|Simi Valley]] and had difficulties in creating a good plot; the one they initially worked with the most, involving a prisoner that gets free by changing his body with another man, was eventually discarded as Gordon felt it was too similar to other episodes written by him. Eventually the duo saw an article in ''[[Scientific American]]'' about [[time travel]] and decided to work with that, following the magazine's reports that while old physics do not allow for temporal displacement to happen, [[quantum physics]] said it was possible.<ref name=meisler/>

Gordon decided that to make "time travel in an ''X-Files'' way", the best way was with "a guy that turns out to be you".<ref name=complete>Hurwitz, Knowles, p. 113</ref> He therefore added the plot about a regretful scientist trying to stop developments from ever occurring. The scientist's character was inspired by a story Gordon heard about [[Manhattan Project]] physicist [[J. Robert Oppenheimer]] berating [[Harry S. Truman]] on the [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|1945 atomic bombings of Japan]], and the writer wondered "What if Oppenheimer could go back to the past and 'uninvent' the bomb?".<ref name=meisler/> Eventually Gordon and Greenwalt found another philosophical question that becomes Jason's motivation to halt his own research - "Life itself is about the unknown and discovering what is in front of us. But if everyone, or maybe some people, knew what would happen, that would create a new set of horrors, and it would need to be stopped".<ref name=meisler/> The script took over a week of writing, with sessions of 15 daily hours and the contributions of [[John Shiban]], [[Frank Spotnitz]] and [[Ken Horton]]. Gordon was still reworking the teleplay the weekend before shooting began in Vancouver, including the removal of two "useless characters" that included a [[Stephen Hawking]]-inspired scientist in a wheelchair.<ref name=meisler/> [[David Duchovny]] declared that a few scenes were created during production "because no one could know if the audience understood what was happening".<ref name=meisler/>

Gordon stated that "In the end, I think it worked, but it's getting there that's really difficult."<ref name=complete/> The experience was hard enough for Gordon to consider giving up and not delivering the script at all, and he eventually swore he would never work with time travel again.<ref name=meisler>Meisler, p. 198</ref>

==Reception==
"Synchrony" originally aired on the [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] network on April&nbsp;13,&nbsp;1997.<ref name="snow"/> This episode earned a [[Nielsen rating]] of 11.3, with a 18 share, meaning that roughly 11.3 percent of all television-equipped households, and 18 percent of households watching television, were tuned in to the episode.<ref name="ratings"/> It was viewed by 18.01 million viewers.<ref name="ratings">Meisler, p. 298</ref>

''[[The A.V. Club]]''{{'s}} Zack Handlen rated the episode an "B-". Handlen considered that while "'Synchrony' has all the pieces of my favorite kind of episode, [it] doesn't really work as well as it should" due to an emotional detachment that made him not care about the scientists and their story, and his finding Old Jason's actions to be illogical.<ref name="avc">{{cite web |url=http://www.avclub.com/articles/synchronypowers-principalities-thrones-and-dominio,51692/ |title='Synchrony'/'Powers, Principalities, Thrones and Dominions' {{!}} The X-Files/Millennium {{!}} TV Club |publisher=''[[The A.V.
