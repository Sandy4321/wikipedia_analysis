'''Charles Sanders Peirce''' ({{pronEng|p<U+025D><U+02D0>s}} ''purse''<ref>"Peirce", in the case of C.S. Peirce, always rhymes with the English-language word "terse" and so, in most dialects, is pronounced exactly like the English-language word "purse": {{audio|en-us-purse.ogg|Audio (US)}}. See "Note on the Pronunciation of 'Peirce'", The ''Peirce [Edition] Project Newsletter'', Vol. 1, Nos. 3/4, Dec. 1994, [http://www.iupui.edu/~peirce/news/1_3/13_4x.htm#pronunciation Eprint].</ref>) (September 10, 1839 &ndash; April 19, 1914) was an American [[logic]]ian, [[mathematics|mathematician]], [[Philosophy|philosopher]], and [[science|scientist]], born in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]]. Peirce was educated as a chemist and employed as a scientist for 30 years. It is largely his contributions to logic, mathematics, philosophy, and [[semiotics]] (and his founding of [[pragmatism]]) that are appreciated today. In 1934, the philosopher [[Paul Weiss (philosopher)|Paul Weiss]] called Peirce "the most original and versatile of American philosophers and America's greatest logician".<ref>[[Paul Weiss (philosopher)|Weiss, Paul]] (1934), "Peirce, Charles Sanders" in the ''Dictionary of American Biography''. ''Arisbe'' [http://www.cspeirce.com/menu/library/aboutcsp/weissbio.htm Eprint].</ref>

An innovator in mathematics, research methodology, [[philosophy of science]], [[epistemology]], and [[metaphysics]], Peirce considered himself a [[logic]]ian first and foremost. He made major contributions to logic, but "logic" for him encompassed much of that which is now called epistemology and philosophy of science. He saw logic, in turn, as the formal branch of [[semiotics]], of which he is a founder. As early as 1886 he saw that logical operations could be carried out by electrical switching circuits, an idea used decades later to produce digital computers.

==Life==
[[Image:Charles Peirce birthplace.jpg|thumb|right|Charles Peirce birthplace near Harvard Yard.]]
Charles Sanders Peirce was the son of Sarah Hunt Mills and [[Benjamin Peirce]], a professor of [[astronomy]] and [[mathematics]] at [[Harvard University]], perhaps the first serious research mathematician in America. At 12 years of age, Charles read an older brother's copy of [[Richard Whately]]'s ''Elements of Logic'', then the leading English language text on the subject. Thus began his lifelong fascination with logic and reasoning. He went on to obtain the BA and MA from Harvard, and in 1863 the [[Lawrence Scientific School]] awarded him its first M.Sc. in [[chemistry]]. This last degree was awarded ''summa cum laude''; otherwise his academic record was undistinguished. At Harvard, he began lifelong friendships with [[Francis Ellingwood Abbot]], [[Chauncey Wright]], and [[William James]]. One of his Harvard instructors, [[Charles William Eliot]], formed an unfavorable opinion of Peirce. This opinion proved fateful, because Eliot, while President of Harvard 1869<U+2013>1909 <U+2014> a period encompassing nearly all of Peirce's working life <U+2014> repeatedly vetoed having Harvard employ Peirce in any capacity.

Peirce suffered all his life from what was then known as "facial neuralgia," a very painful nervous/facial condition. The biography by Joseph Brent<ref>Brent, Joseph (1998), ''Charles Sanders Peirce: A Life''. Revised and enlarged edition, Indiana University Press, Bloomington, IN.</ref> says that when in the throes of its pain "he was, at first, almost stupefied, and then aloof, cold, depressed, extremely suspicious, impatient of the slightest crossing, and subject to violent outbursts of temper." His condition would today be diagnosed as [[trigeminal neuralgia]]. Its consequences may have led to the social isolation which made the later years of his life so tragic.

===United States Coast Survey===
Between 1859 and 1891, Peirce was intermittently employed in various scientific capacities by the [[U.S. National Geodetic Survey|United States Coast Survey]], where he enjoyed the protection of his highly influential father until the latter's death in 1880. This employment exempted Peirce from having to take part in the [[American Civil War|Civil War]]. It would have been very awkward for him to do so, as the Boston [[Brahmin]] Peirces sympathized with the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]]. At the Survey, he worked mainly in [[geodesy]] and in [[gravimetry]], refining the use of [[pendulum]]s to determine small local variations in the strength of [[Earth]]'s [[gravity]]. The Survey sent him to Europe five times, the first in 1871, as part of a group dispatched to observe a [[solar eclipse]]. While in Europe, he sought out [[Augustus De Morgan]], [[William Stanley Jevons]], and [[William Kingdon Clifford]], British mathematicians and logicians whose turn of mind resembled his own. From 1869 to 1872, he was employed as an Assistant in Harvard's astronomical observatory, doing important work on determining the brightness of [[star]]s and the shape of the [[Milky Way]]. (On Peirce the astronomer, see Lenzen's chapter in Moore and Robin, 1964.) In 1876 he was elected a member of the [[United States National Academy of Sciences|National Academy of Sciences]]. In 1878, he was the first to define the [[meter]] as so many [[wavelength]]s of [[light]] of a certain [[frequency]], the definition employed until 1983 (Taylor 2001: 5)<ref>Taylor, Barry N., ed. (2001), ''[http://physics.nist.gov/Pubs/SP330/sp330.pdf The International System of Units, NIST Special Publication 330]''. Washington DC: Superintendent of Documents.</ref>.

During the 1880s, Peirce's indifference to bureaucratic detail waxed while the quality and timeliness of his Survey work waned. Peirce took years to write reports that he should have completed in mere months. Meanwhile, he wrote hundreds of logic, philosophy, and science entries for the ''Century Dictionary''.<ref>See the Peirce Edition Project (PEP) on Peirce's contributions to the Century Dictionary at UQ<U+00C0>M (<span lang=fr>Universit<U+00E9> du Qu<U+00E9>bec <U+00E0> Montr<U+00E9>al</span>) at http://www.pep.uqam.ca/index_en.pep . <BR>The ''Century Dictionary'' itself is available both online (at no charge) and on CD at http://www.global-language.com/century/ .</ref> In 1885, an investigation by the [[Allison Commission]] exonerated Peirce, but led to the dismissal of Superintendent [[Julius Hilgard]] and several other Coast Survey employees for misuse of public funds. In 1891, Peirce resigned from the Coast Survey, at the request of Superintendent [[Thomas Corwin Mendenhall]]. He never again held regular employment.

===Johns Hopkins University===
In 1879, Peirce was appointed Lecturer in logic at the new [[Johns Hopkins University]]. That university was strong in a number of areas that interested him, such as philosophy ([[Josiah Royce|Royce]] and [[John Dewey|Dewey]] did their PhDs at Hopkins), psychology (taught by [[G. Stanley Hall]] and studied by [[Joseph Jastrow]], who coauthored a landmark empirical study with Peirce), and mathematics (taught by [[J. J. Sylvester]], who came to admire Peirce's work on mathematics and logic). This nontenured position proved to be the only academic appointment Peirce ever held.

Brent documents something Peirce never suspected, namely that his efforts to obtain academic employment, grants, and scientific respectability were repeatedly frustrated by the covert opposition of a major American scientist of the day, [[Simon Newcomb]]. Peirce's ability to find academic employment may also have been frustrated by a difficult personality. Brent conjectures about various psychological and other difficulties.

Peirce's personal life also handicapped him. His first wife, Harriet Melusina Fay, left him in 1875. He soon took up with a woman whose maiden name and nationality remain uncertain to this day (the best guess is that her name was Juliette Froissy and that she was French), but his divorce from Harriet became final only in 1883, after which he married Juliette. That year, Newcomb pointed out to a Johns Hopkins trustee that Peirce, while a Hopkins employee, had lived and traveled with a woman to whom he was not married. The ensuing scandal led to his dismissal. Just why Peirce's later applications for academic employment at [[Clark University]], [[University of Wisconsin-Madison]], [[University of Michigan]], [[Cornell University]], [[Stanford University]], and the [[University of Chicago]] were all unsuccessful can no longer be determined. Presumably, his having lived with Juliette for years while still legally married to Harriet led him to be deemed morally unfit for academic employment anywhere in the USA. Peirce had no children by either marriage.

===Poverty===
In 1887 Peirce spent part of his inheritance from his parents to buy {{convert|2000|acre|km2|0}} of rural land near [[Milford, Pennsylvania]], land which never yielded an economic return. There he built a large house which he named "Arisbe" where he spent the rest of his life, writing prolifically, much of it unpublished to this day. His living beyond his means soon led to grave financial and legal difficulties. Peirce spent much of his last two decades unable to afford heat in winter, and subsisting on old bread kindly donated by the local baker. Unable to afford new stationery, he wrote on the verso side of old manuscripts. An outstanding warrant for assault and unpaid debts led to his being a fugitive in New York City for a while. Several people, including his brother [[James Mills Peirce]] and his neighbors, relatives of [[Gifford Pinchot]], settled his debts and paid his property taxes and mortgage.

Peirce did some scientific and engineering consulting and wrote a good deal for meager pay, mainly dictionary and encyclopedia entries, and reviews for ''[[The Nation (U.S. periodical)|The Nation]]'' (with whose editor, [[Wendell Phillips Garrison]] he became friendly). He did translations for the [[Smithsonian Institution]], at its director [[Samuel Langley]]'s instigation. Peirce also did substantial mathematical calculations for Langley's research on powered flight. Hoping to make money, Peirce tried inventing. He began but did not complete a number of books. In 1888, President [[Grover Cleveland]] appointed him to the [[Assay Commission]]. From 1890 onwards, he had a friend and admirer in Judge [[Francis C. Russell]] of Chicago, who introduced Peirce to [[Paul Carus]] and [[Open Court Publishing Company|Edward Hegeler]], the editor and the owner, respectively, of the pioneering American philosophy journal ''[[Open Court Publishing Company|The Monist]]'', which eventually published 14 or so articles by Peirce. He applied to the newly formed [[Carnegie Institution]] for a grant to write a book summarizing his life's work. The application was doomed; his nemesis Newcomb served on the Institution's executive committee, and its President had been the President of Johns Hopkins at the time of Peirce's dismissal.

The one who did the most to help Peirce in these desperate times was his old friend [[William James]], who dedicated his ''Will to Believe'' (1897) to Peirce, and who arranged for Peirce to be paid to give four series of lectures at or near Harvard (1898, 1903, 1907). Most important, each year from 1898 until his death in 1910, James would write to his friends in the Boston intelligentsia, asking that they make a financial contribution to help support Peirce. Peirce reciprocated by designating James's eldest son as his heir should Juliette predecease him.<ref>It has been said (Brent 1998:315<U+2013>16, 374), that this was Peirce's motive for adding '''Santiago''', 'Saint James' in Spanish, to his full name, but Peirce was mentioned in print as "Charles Santiago Peirce" in 1890, 1891, and 1892, years before James's publicizing him and helping him to get lectures and funds. See for example p. [http://books.google.com/books?id=_18AAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA65 65] of the <span lang=de>''Jahrbuch <U+00FC>ber die Fortschritte der Mathematik''</span>, v. XXIV for 1892, published 1895. <br>The claim of some connection between "Santiago" and William James goes back at least to William James's wife Alice, quoted in 1927 by F.C.S. Schiller on pp. 90-91 in "William James and the Making of Pragmatism" in ''The Personalist'' 8, April 1927. <BR>Joseph Brent (author of ''Charles Sanders Peirce: A Life'', history professor emeritus, U District of Columbia) claimed to have found Peirce explaining his motive as gratitude to William James in MS 318, but other scholars don't find it there. That issue was raised at peirce-l in 2000, where Brent [http://lyris.ttu.edu/read/messages?id=13608#13608 wrote] on Sept. 6, 2000 and [http://lyris.ttu.edu/read/messages?id=13702#13702 again on] Sept. 7, 2000 that he clearly remembers ''some'' MS wherein Peirce says that he adopted "Santiago" in honor of James. (However, if Peirce did not adopt it for that reason, still possibly he retained and increasingly used during some later years for that reason.) <br>In recent [http://lyris.ttu.edu/read/messages?id=520216#520216 correspondence at] peirce-l: Prof. Emeritus [http://www.cspeirce.com/homepage/ransdell.htm Joseph Ransdell] writes that while he was a Columbia graduate student he noticed an 1890 listing of Peirce with "Santiago" in Schr<U+00F6>der and pointed it out to some Peirce scholars; Prof. Jaime Nubiola, director of the Grupo de Estudios Peirceanos ([http://www.unav.es/gep/ GEP]) at U Navarra, Spain, in turn writes that <blockquote>on p. 710 of Ernst Schroeder 1890 below "Peirce, Benjamin (gesprochen: P<U+00F6>rss)" is listed: "Peirce, Charles S(antiago)." and eleven quotations from his papers are included under that entry.</blockquote> Nubiola points out that the mathematician Ventura Reyes Pr<U+00F3>sper referred to Peirce's middle name as "Santiago" in letters and two papers (1891 and 1892) and wrote in a footnote to the 1892 paper: "Although it may seem strange, his first name is in English and his second is in Spanish; I do not know why." For the letters and papers, see Jaime Nubiola and Jes<U+00FA>s Cobo, "The Spanish Mathematician Ventura Reyes Pr<U+00F3>sper and his connections with Charles S. Peirce and Christine Ladd-Franklin" (version 11-6-2000), ''Arisbe'' [http://www.cspeirce.com/menu/library/aboutcsp/nubiola/reyes.htm Eprint]. <br>In MS 1611 (1903), for manuscript directory and biographical dictionary of the ''Men of Science in the United States'' (see [http://www.iupui.edu/~peirce/robin/robin_fm/bio.htm page] at the Robin Catalogue), Peirce wrote: "(I am variously listed in print as Charles Santiago Peirce, Charles Saunders Peirce, and Charles Sanders Peirce. Under the circumstances a noncommittal S. suits me best)" (as quoted and sourced by Susan Howe, ''Pierce-Arrow'', 1999, Google Book Search Beta [http://books.google.com/books?id=gV0P31ThemoC&printsec=frontcover&dq=%221611%22#PPA7,M1 Eprint], B&N [http://search.barnesandnoble.com/bookSearch/isbnInquiry.asp?r=1&ISBN=0811214109&r=1 Eprint], scroll down, click on "Features", scroll down). <br>Peirce used "Santiago Sanders" <U+2014> both middle names together <U+2014> in ''The Monist'', v. XVI, 1906, n. 1, "Mr. Peterson's Proposed Discussion", p. [http://books.google.com/books?id=3KoLAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA151 151]; v.

Peirce died destitute in [[Milford, Pennsylvania]], twenty years before his widow.

==Reception==
[[Bertrand Russell]] opined (1959:276), "Beyond doubt [...] he was one of the most original minds of the later nineteenth century, and certainly the greatest American thinker ever." (His ''[[Principia Mathematica]]'' does not mention Peirce, but Peirce's work was not widely known until after this was written.) [[A. N. Whitehead]], while reading some of Peirce's unpublished manuscripts soon after arriving at Harvard in 1924, was struck by how Peirce had anticipated his own "process" thinking. (On Peirce and [[process metaphysics]], see the chapter by Lowe in Moore and Robin, 1964.) [[Karl Popper]] viewed Peirce as "one of the greatest philosophers of all times".<ref>Quoted by James Bird, ''A Giant's Voice from the Past'', Times Higher Education Supplement, 8 Sept. 1989.</ref> Nevertheless, Peirce's accomplishments were not immediately recognized. His imposing contemporaries [[William James]] and [[Josiah Royce]] admired him, and [[Cassius Jackson Keyser]] at Columbia and [[C. K. Ogden]] wrote about Peirce with respect, but to no immediate effect.

The first scholar to give Peirce his considered professional attention was Royce's student [[Morris Raphael Cohen]], the editor of a 1923 anthology of Peirce's writings titled ''[[Charles Sanders Peirce bibliography#CLL|Chance, Love, and Logic]]'' and the author of the first bibliography of Peirce's scattered writings. [[John Dewey]] had had Peirce as an instructor at Johns Hopkins, and from 1916 onwards, Dewey's writings repeatedly mention Peirce with deference. His 1938 ''Logic: The Theory of Inquiry'' is Peircean through and through. The publication of the first six volumes of the ''Collected Papers'' (1931<U+2013>35), the most important event to date in Peirce studies and one Cohen made possible by raising the needed funds, did not lead to an immediate outpouring of secondary studies. The editors of those volumes, [[Charles Hartshorne]] and [[Paul Weiss (philosopher)|Paul Weiss]], did not become Peirce specialists. Early landmarks of the secondary literature include the monographs by Buchler (1939), Feibleman (1946), and [[T. A. Goudge|Goudge]] (1950), the 1941 Ph.D. thesis by [[Arthur W. Burks]] (who went on to edit volumes 7 and 8 of the ''Collected Papers''), and the edited volume Wiener and Young (1952). The Charles S. Peirce Society was founded in 1946. Its ''Transactions'', an academic journal specializing in Peirce, pragmatism, and American philosophy, has appeared since 1965.

In 1949, while doing unrelated archival work, the historian of mathematics [[Carolyn Eisele]] (1902<U+2013>2000) chanced on an autograph letter by Peirce. Thus began her 40 years of research on Peirce the mathematician and scientist, culminating in Eisele (1976, 1979, 1985). Beginning around 1960, the philosopher and [[history of ideas|historian of ideas]] [[Max Fisch]] (1900<U+2013>1995) emerged as an authority on Peirce; Fisch (1986) reprints many of the relevant articles, including a wide-ranging survey (Fisch 1986: 422-48) of the impact of Peirce's thought through 1983.

Peirce has come to enjoy a significant international following.

Founded 1998 by Carlo Sini and Rossella Fabbrichesi.</ref>. His writings have been translated into several languages, including German, French, Finnish, Spanish, and Swedish. Since 1950, there have been French, Italian, Spanish and British Peirceans of note. For many years, the North American philosophy department most devoted to Peirce was the [[University of Toronto]]'s, thanks in good part to the leadership of [[T. A. Goudge|Thomas Goudge]] and David Savan. In recent years, American Peirce scholars have clustered at [[IUPUI|Indiana University - Purdue University Indianapolis]], the home of the Peirce Edition Project, and the [[Pennsylvania State University]].

Robert Burch has commented on Peirce's current influence as follows:

<blockquote>
Currently, considerable interest is being taken in Peirce's ideas from outside the arena of academic philosophy. The interest comes from industry, business, technology, and the military; and it has resulted in the existence of a number of agencies, institutes, and laboratories in which ongoing research into and development of Peircean concepts is being undertaken. (Burch 2001/2006<ref>Burch, Robert (2001), "[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/peirce/ Charles Sanders Peirce]" in the [[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]. Revised, Summer 2006.</ref>.)
</blockquote>

==Works==
Peirce's reputation rests largely on a number of academic papers published in American scholarly and scientific journals. These papers, along with a selection of Peirce's previously unpublished work and a smattering of his correspondence, fill the eight volumes of the ''[[Charles Sanders Peirce bibliography#CP|Collected Papers of Charles Sanders Peirce]]'' (CP), published between 1931 and 1958, still in print. An important recent sampler of Peirce's philosophical writings is the two-volume ''[[Charles Sanders Peirce bibliography#EP|The Essential Peirce]]'' (EP), 1992, 1998, in print. The first published sampler was the one-volume ''[[Charles Sanders Peirce bibliography#CLL|Chance, Love and Logic: Philosophical Essays]]'', 1920, still in print. [[Charles Sanders Peirce bibliography#Other collections|Other such single volumes]] were published in 1940, 1957, 1958, 1972, and 1994.

The only full-length book that Peirce authored and saw published in his lifetime was ''Photometric Researches''<ref>Wilhelm Engelmann, Leipzig, Germany.

While at Johns Hopkins, he edited ''[[Charles Sanders Peirce bibliography#SIL|Studies in Logic]]'' (published 1883), containing chapters by himself and his graduate students. An abridged 23-page version of Peirce's syllabus for his 1903 Lowell Institute lectures was published as a pamphlet in 1903.<ref>''A Syllabus of Certain Topics in Logic'' (1903), Alfred Mudge & Son, printers, Boston, 1903. See Robin Catalogue entry for MS 478, [http://www.iupui.edu/~peirce/robin/robin_fm/logic.htm Eprint] for description.</ref> He wrote papers and articles appearing in ''Proceedings of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]]'', the ''Journal of Speculative Philosophy'', ''[[The Monist]]'', ''[[Popular Science]] Monthly'', the ''[[American Journal of Mathematics]]'', ''Memoirs of the [[United States National Academy of Sciences|National Academy of Sciences]]'', ''[[The Nation (U.S. periodical)|The Nation]]'', and elsewhere.

[[Harvard University]] acquired the papers found in Peirce's study soon after his death, but did not microfilm them until 1964. Only after Richard Robin (1967)<ref>Robin, Richard S. (1967) ''Annotated Catalogue of the Papers of Charles S. Peirce''. Amherst MA: University of Massachusetts Press. PEP [http://www.iupui.edu/~peirce/robin/robin.htm Eprint].</ref> catalogued this ''[[Literary executor|Nachlass]]'' did it become clear that Peirce had left approximately 1650 unpublished manuscripts, totaling over 100,000 pages.<ref>"The manuscript material now (1997) comes to more than a hundred thousand pages.

In 1976, many previously unpublished Peirce manuscripts on mathematical subjects, along with Peirce's important published mathematical articles, were collected in ''[[Charles Sanders Peirce bibliography#NEM|The New Elements of Mathematics by Charles S. Peirce]]'' (NEM), 4 volumes in 5. In 1977, Peirce's entire correspondence (1903<U+2013>1912) with [[Victoria, Lady Welby]] was published in ''[[Charles Sanders Peirce bibliography#SS|Semiotic and Significs]]'', 2nd edition 2001; Peirce's other published correspondence is largely limited to the 14 letters included in volume 8 of the ''Collected Papers'', and the 20-odd pre-1890 items included so far in the ''Writings''. In 1975<U+2013>1987, Peirce's more than 300 reviews and articles published 1869<U+2013>1908 in ''[[The Nation (U.S. periodical)|The Nation]]'' were collected in [[Charles Sanders Peirce bibliography#CN|''Charles Sanders Peirce: Contributions to'' The Nation]], 4 volumes.

''Arisbe'' [http://www.cspeirce.com/menu/library/aboutcsp/auspitz/escape.htm Eprint].</ref>, "The extent of Peirce's immersion in the science of his day is evident in his reviews in ''the Nation'' [...] and in his papers, grant applications, and publishers' prospectuses in the history and practice of science", referring latterly to the two-volume ''[[Charles Sanders Peirce bibliography#HP|Historical Perspectives on Peirce's Logic of Science: A History of Science]]'' published in 1985. In 1992, Peirce's 1898 series of lectures, invited by William James, were collected in one place in ''[[Charles Sanders Peirce bibliography#RLT|Reasoning and the Logic of Things]]''. In 1997, Peirce's 1903 Harvard "Lectures on Pragmatism" were published in ''Pragmatism as a Principle and Method of Right Thinking'', a study edition of Peirce's lecture manuscripts which had been previously published in abridged form; the lectures now also appear in EP 2. Besides lectures during his years (1879<U+2013>1884) as Lecturer in Logic at Johns Hopkins, he gave at least eight series of lectures, many now published; see [[Charles Sanders Peirce bibliography#Lectures by Peirce|Lectures by Peirce]].

The limited coverage, and defective editing and organization, of the ''Collected Papers'' led Max Fisch and others in the 1970s to found the Peirce Edition Project, whose mission is to prepare a more complete critical chronological edition, the ''[[Charles Sanders Peirce bibliography#W|Writings of Charles S. Peirce, A Chronological Edition]]'' (W). Only 6 out of a planned 30 volumes have appeared to date, but they cover the period from 1859<U+2013>1890, when Peirce carried out much of his best-known work. W 8's publication is planned for spring 2010; and work continues on W 7, 9, and 11.

==Mathematics==
Peirce regarded mathematics as prior not only to special sciences (of nature and mind) but also to philosophy, and as broadly divided into mathematics (1) of logic, (2) of discrete series, and (3) of pseudo-continuous series (as he called them, including the [[real numbers]]) and continuous series. He was active not only in various 'pure' areas, but also in probability and statistics.
===Mathematics of logic===
<blockquote>
It may be added that algebra was formerly called ''Cossic'', in English, or the ''Rule of Cos''; and the first algebra published in England was called "The Whetstone of Wit", because the author supposed that the word ''cos'' was the Latin word so spelled, which means a whetstone. But in fact, ''cos'' was derived from the Italian, ''cosa'', thing, the thing you want to find, the unknown quantity whose value is sought. It is the Latin ''<span lang=la>caussa</span>'', a thing aimed at, a cause. ("Elements of Mathematics", MS 165 (c. 1895), NEM 2:50.)
</blockquote>

Peirce made a number of striking discoveries in foundational mathematics, nearly all of which came to be appreciated only long after his death. He:

:* Discovered in 1880<ref>"A Boolean Algebra with One Constant", 1880 MS, CP 4.12-20.</ref> how that which is now called [[Boolean algebra (logic)|Boolean algebra]] could be expressed by means of a single binary operation, either [[Sheffer stroke|NAND]] or its dual, [[Sheffer stroke|NOR]]. (See also [[De Morgan's Laws]]). This discovery anticipated [[Henry M. Sheffer|Sheffer]] by 33 years.

:* In Peirce (1881)<ref>Peirce, C. S. (1881), "On the Logic of Number", ''American Journal of Mathematics'' v. 4, pp. 85-95. Reprinted (CP 3.252-288), (W 4:299-309). ''Google Book Search [http://books.google.com/books?id=LQgPAAAAIAAJ&jtp=85 Eprint].</ref> set out the now-classic [[Peano axioms|axiomatization of natural number arithmetic]], a few years before [[Dedekind]] and [[Peano]] did so. In the same paper Peirce introduced the first purely cardinal definition of a finite set<ref>See Shields, Paul (1997), "Peirce<U+2019>s Axiomatization of Arithmetic", in Houser, Nathan  Roberts, Don D., and Van Evra, James W. (eds.), ''Studies in the Logic of Charles S. Peirce''.</ref>, by the property now called that of being "[[Dedekind-finite]]".

:* Discovered, independently of Dedekind, an important formal definition of an [[infinite set]], namely, as a [[Set (mathematics)|set]] that can be put into a [[one-to-one correspondence]] with one of its proper [[subsets]].

:* In Peirce (1885), set out what can be read as the first (primitive) [[axiomatic set theory]], anticipating [[Zermelo]] by about two decades.

In 1918, the logician [[Clarence Irving Lewis|C.&nbsp;I. Lewis]] wrote, "The contributions of C.S. Peirce to symbolic logic are more numerous and varied than those of any other writer <U+2014> at least in the nineteenth century."<ref>Lewis, Clarence Irving (1918), "Peirce", ch. 1, <U+00A7> 7, on pp. 79-106, in Lewis's ''A Survey of Symbolic Logic'', University of California Press, Berkeley, CA. ''Internet Archive'' [http://www.archive.org/search.php?query=A%20Survey%20of%20Symbolic%20AND%20mediatype%3Atexts Eprint].</ref> Beginning with his first paper on the [[Logic of Relatives (1870)|"Logic of Relatives" (1870)]], Peirce extended the [[theory of relations]] that [[Augustus De Morgan]] had just recently awakened from its Cinderella slumbers. Much of the actual mathematics of relations now taken for granted was "borrowed" from Peirce, not always with all due credit (Anellis 1995<ref name=Anellis>Anellis, Irving H. (1995), "Peirce Rustled, Russell Pierced: How Charles Peirce and Bertrand Russell Viewed Each Other's Work in Logic, and an Assessment of Russell's Accuracy and Role in the Historiography of Logic", ''Modern Logic'', 5, 270<U+2013>328. ''Arisbe'' [http://www.cspeirce.com/menu/library/aboutcsp/anellis/csp&br.htm Eprint].</ref>). Beginning in 1940, [[Alfred Tarski]] and his students rediscovered aspects of Peirce's larger vision of relational logic, developing the perspective of [[relational algebra]]. These theoretical resources gradually worked their way into applications, in large part instigated by the work of [[Edgar F. Codd]], who happened to be a doctoral student of the Peirce editor and scholar [[Arthur W. Burks]], on the [[relational model]] or the relational paradigm for implementing and using [[database]]s.

In the four-volume work ''The New Elements of Mathematics by Charles S. Peirce'' (1976), mathematician and Peirce scholar Carolyn Eisele published a large number of Peirce's previously unpublished manuscripts on mathematical subjects, including the drafts for an introductory textbook, allusively titled ''The New Elements of Mathematics'', that presented mathematics from a decidedly novel, if not revolutionary, standpoint.

In 1902 Peirce applied to the newly established [[Carnegie Institution of Washington|Carnegie Institution]] for aid "in accomplishing certain scientific work", presenting an "explanation of ''what work'' is proposed" plus an "appendix containing a fuller statement". These parts of the letter, along with excerpts from earlier drafts, can be found in NEM 4 (Eisele 1976). The appendix is organized as a "List of Proposed Memoirs on Logic", and No. 12 among the 36 proposals is titled "On the Definition of Logic", the earlier draft of which is quoted in full [[#Logic_as_formal_semiotic|below]].

On Peirce and his contemporaries [[Ernst Schr<U+00F6>der]] and [[Frege|Gottlob Frege]], [[Hilary Putnam]] (1982)<ref>Putnam, Hilary (1982), "Peirce the Logician', ''Historia Mathematica'' 9, 290<U+2013>301. Reprinted, pp. 252<U+2013>260 in Hilary Putnam, ''Realism with a Human Face'', Harvard University Press, Cambridge, MA, 1990. Excerpt consisting of article's last five pages: [http://www.jfsowa.com/peirce/putnam.htm Eprint].</ref> wrote that he found through research that, though Frege had priority by four years, it was Peirce and his student [[Oscar Howard Mitchell]] who effectively discovered the quantifier for the mathematical world. The main evidence for Putnam's claims is "On the Algebra of Logic: A Contribution to the Philosophy of Notation"<ref>Peirce, C.S. (1884-1885), "On the Algebra of Logic: A Contribution to the Philosophy of Notation", ''American Journal of Mathematics'' [http://books.google.com/books?id=lwYPAAAAIAAJ&printsec=titlepage 7], two parts, first part published 1885, pp. 180<U+2013>202. Presented, National Academy of Sciences, Newport, RI, 14<U+2013>17 Oct 1884. Reprinted (CP 3.359<U+2013>403), (W 5:162<U+2013>190), (EP 1:225<U+2013>228, in part). [http://books.google.com/books?id=lwYPAAAAIAAJ&&pg=PA180 Eprint] via Google Book Search Beta; users outside the USA may not yet be able to gain full access.</ref> (1885), published in the premier American mathematical journal of the day. [[Peano]] and [[Ernst Schr<U+00F6>der]], among others, cited this article and used or adapted Peirce's notations, which are a typographical variant of those currently used. Peirce apparently was ignorant of Frege's work, despite their rival achievements in logic, [[philosophy of language]], and the [[foundations of mathematics]].

Peirce's other major discoveries in formal logic include:

:* Distinguishing (Peirce, 1885) between first-order and second-order quantification.

:* Seeing that Boolean calculations could be carried out by means of electrical switches,<ref>Letter, Peirce to A. Marquand, W 5:421<U+2013>424</ref> anticipating [[Claude Shannon]] by more than 50 years.

:* Devising the [[existential graph]]s, a diagrammatic notation for the [[predicate calculus]]. These graphs form the basis of [[John F. Sowa]]'s [[conceptual graph]]s and of Sun-Joo Shin's [[diagrammatic reasoning]].

A philosophy of logic, grounded in his categories and semiotic, can be extracted from Peirce's writings. This philosophy, as well as Peirce's logical work more generally, is exposited and defended in [http://www.jfsowa.com/peirce/putnam.htm Hilary Putnam (1982)]; the Introduction in Houser et al. (1997)<ref>Houser, Nathan, Roberts, Don D., and Van Evra, James (eds., 1997), ''Studies in the Logic of Charles Sanders Peirce'', Indiana University Press, Bloomington, IN.</ref>; and Dipert's chapter in Misak (2004)<ref>Misak, Cheryl J. (ed., 2004), ''The Cambridge Companion to Peirce'', Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, UK</ref>. [[Jean Van Heijenoort]] (1967)<ref>[[Jean van Heijenoort|van Heijenoort, Jean]] (1967), "Logic as Language and Logic as Calculus," ''Synthese 17'': 324<U+2013>30.</ref>, [[Jaakko Hintikka]] in his chapter in Brunning and Forster (1997), and Geraldine Brady (2000)<ref>Brady, Geraldine (2000), ''From Peirce to Skolem: A Neglected Chapter in the History of Logic'', North-Holland/Elsevier Science BV, Amsterdam, Netherlands.</ref> divide those who study formal (and natural) languages into two camps: the [[model theory|model-theorists]] / [[semantics|semanticists]], and the [[proof theory|proof theorists]] / universalists. Hintikka and Brady view Peirce as a pioneer model theorist. On how the young [[Bertrand Russell]], especially his ''Principles of Mathematics'' and [[Principia Mathematica]], did not do Peirce justice, see Anellis (1995)<ref name=Anellis />.

Peirce's work on formal logic had admirers other than [[Ernst Schr<U+00F6>der]]:

:* The philosophical algebraist [[William Kingdon Clifford]] and the logician [[William Ernest Johnson]], both British;

:* The Polish school of logic and foundational mathematics, including [[Alfred Tarski]];

:* [[Arthur Prior]], whose ''Formal Logic'' and chapter in Moore and Robin (1964) praised and studied Peirce's logical work.

{{main|Logical graph}}

====Logic of information====
{{main|Logic of information}}

<blockquote>
.... The information of a term is the measure of its superfluous comprehension. That is to say that the proper office of the comprehension is to determine the extension of the term. For instance, you and I are men because we possess those attributes <U+2014> having two legs, being rational, &tc. <U+2014> which make up the comprehension of ''man''. Every addition to the comprehension of a term lessens its extension up to a certain point, after that further additions increase the information instead. (C.S. Peirce, "The Logic of Science, or, Induction and Hypothesis" (1866), W 1:467.)
</blockquote>

===Geometry and continuity===
Peirce produced a [[Peirce quincuncial projection|quincuncial projection]] of a sphere which kept angles true and resulted in less distortion of area than did other projections.

Continuity, or [[synechism]], is important, even crucial, in Peirce's philosophy. He worked long on the mathematics of continua and noted both that, in an 1882 paper, he anticipated Dedekind and that, unknowingly at the time, he was largely anticipated by Cantor; he held for many years that the real numbers constituted a pseudocontinuum and that a true continuum of instants was not a "multitude" (as he called it) or Cantorian aleph, that it had, within any lapse of time, room enough for any multitude howsoever great, and that it was the real subject matter of that which we now call topology.<ref>Peirce, C.S., "Analysis of the Methods of Mathematical Demonstration", Memoir 4, Draft C, Manuscript L75.90-102, see 99-100, [http://www.cspeirce.com/menu/library/bycsp/l75/ver1/l75v1-02.htm#m4 Eprint] and scroll down.</ref> In 1908 he gave up on that particular conception of continua.<ref>See "Peirce's Clarifications on Continuity" by J<U+00E9>r<U+00F4>me Havenel, [http://inscribe.iupress.org/toc/tra/44/1 ''Transactions'' Winter 2008] pp. 68-133. From p. 119: "It is on May 26, 1908, that Peirce finally gave up his idea that in every continuum there is room for whatever collection of any multitude. From now on, there are different kinds of continua, which have different properties."</ref>

===Probability and statistics===
Peirce held that science achieves statistical probabilities, not certainties, and that chance, a veering from law, is very real. He assigned probability to an argument<U+2019>s conclusion rather than to a proposition, event, etc., as such. Most of his statistical writings promote the [[Frequency probability|frequency interpretation]] of probability (objective ratios of cases), and many of his writings express skepticism about (and criticize the use of) [[statistical model|probability]] when such models are not based on objective [[randomization]].<ref>Peirce condemned the use of "certain [[likelihood function|likelihoods]]" even more strongly than he criticized [[Bayesian statistics|Bayesian methods]]. Indeed Peirce used [[Bayesian inference]] in criticizing parapsychology.</ref> Though Peirce was largely a frequentist, his [[possible world semantics]] introduced the "[[propensity]]" theory of probability. Peirce (sometimes with [[Joseph Jastrow|Jastrow]]) investigated the [[Bayesian probability|probability judgments]] of experimental subjects, pioneering [[decision analysis]].

Peirce was one of the [[founders of statistics]]. He formulated modern statistics in "[[Charles Sanders Peirce bibliography#illus|Illustrations of the Logic of Science]]" (1877<U+2013>1878) and "[[Charles Sanders Peirce bibliography#SIL|A Theory of Probable Inference]]" (1883). With a [[repeated measures design]], he introduced [[Blinding|blinded]], [[Randomized controlled trial|controlled randomized experiments]] (before [[Ronald A. Fisher|Fisher]]). He invented [[optimal design]] for experiments on gravity, in which he "[[analysis of variance|corrected the means]]". He used [[logistic regression]], [[correlation]], and [[smoothing]], and improved the treatment of [[Peirce's criterion|outliers]]. He introduced terms "[[Confidence interval|confidence]]" and "[[Likelihood function|likelihood]]" (before [[Jerzy Neyman|Neyman]] and [[Ronald A. Fisher|Fisher]]). (See the historical books of [[Stephen Stigler]].)

==Philosophy==
<blockquote>
It is not sufficiently recognized that Peirce<U+2019>s career was that of a scientist, not a philosopher; and that during his lifetime he was known and valued chiefly as a scientist, only secondarily as a logician, and scarcely at all as a philosopher. Even his work in philosophy and logic will not be understood until this fact becomes a standing premise of Peircian studies. (Max Fisch, in (Moore and Robin 1964, 486).
</blockquote>

Peirce was a working scientist for 30 years, and arguably was a professional philosopher only during the five years he lectured at Johns Hopkins. He learned philosophy mainly by reading, each day, a few pages of [[Kant]]'s ''[[Critique of Pure Reason]]'', in the original German, while a Harvard undergraduate. His writings bear on a wide array of disciplines, including [[astronomy]], [[metrology]], geodesy, [[mathematics]], [[logic]], [[philosophy]], the [[history and philosophy of science]], [[linguistics]], [[economics]], and [[psychology]]. This work has become the subject of renewed interest and approval, resulting in a revival inspired not only by his anticipations of recent scientific developments but also by his demonstration of how philosophy can be applied effectively to human problems.

Peirce's writings repeatedly refer to a system of three [[category of being|categories]], named Firstness, Secondness, and Thirdness, devised early in his career in reaction to his reading of [[Aristotle]], [[Kant]], and [[Hegel]]. He later initiated the philosophical tendency known as [[pragmatism]], a variant of which his life-long friend [[William James]] made popular. Peirce believed that any truth is provisional, and that the truth of any proposition cannot be certain but only probable. The name he gave to this state of affairs was "[[fallibilism]]". This fallibilism and pragmatism may be seen as playing roles in his work similar to those of [[skepticism]] and [[positivism]], respectively, in the work of others. He divided philosophy into three areas, (1) Phenomenology (which he also called Phaneroscopy or Categorics), (2) Normative sciences (esthetics, ethics, and logic), and (3) Metaphysics; his views on them are discussed in order below.

===Theory of categories===
{{main|Categories (Peirce)}}

On May 14, 1867, the 27-year-old Peirce presented a paper entitled "[http://www.cspeirce.com/menu/library/bycsp/newlist/nl-frame.htm On a New List of Categories]" to the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]], which published it the following year. The paper outlined a theory of predication, involving three universal categories that Peirce would apply throughout philosophy and elsewhere for the rest of his life. Most students of Peirce will readily agree about their prevalence throughout his philosophical work. Peirce scholars generally regard the "New List" as foundational or breaking the ground for Peirce's "architectonic", his blueprint for a pragmatic philosophy. In the categories one will discern, concentrated, the pattern which one finds formed by the three grades of clearness in "[http://www.cspeirce.com/menu/library/bycsp/ideas/id-frame.htm How To Make Our Ideas Clear]" (1878 foundational paper for pragmatism), and in numerous other trichotomies in his work.

"On a New List of Categories" is cast as a Kantian deduction; it is short but dense and difficult to summarize. The following table is compiled from that and later works.

The point is not merely ''noun'' (the ground) versus ''adjective'' (the quality), but whether we are considering the black(ness) as abstracted away from application to an object, or instead as so applied (for instance to a stove). Yet note that Peirce's distinction here is not that between a property-general and a property-individual (a [[Trope (philosophy)|trope]]). See "[http://www.cspeirce.com/menu/library/bycsp/newlist/nl-frame.htm On a New List of Categories]" (1867), in the section appearing in CP 1.551.

They regard an object as it is in itself as ''such'' (''quale''); for example, as horse, tree, or man.

|}
&nbsp;''*Note:'' An interpretant is an interpretation in the sense of the product of an interpretive process or the content of an interpretation.

===Esthetics and ethics===
Peirce did not write extensively in esthetics and ethics, but held that, together with logic in the broad sense, those studies constituted the normative sciences. He defined esthetics as the study of good and bad; and characterized the good as "the admirable". He held that, as the study of good and bad, esthetics is the study of the ends governing all conduct and comes ahead of other normative studies.<ref>See "Charles S. Peirce on Esthetics and Ethics: A Bibliography" by Kelly A. Parker, of the Department of Philosophy, Grand Valley State University, Allendale, Michigan, USA in 1999. {{PDFlink|[http://agora.phi.gvsu.edu/kap/CSP_Bibliography/CSP_norm_bib.pdf Eprint] |145&nbsp;[[Kibibyte|KiB]]<!-- application/pdf, 149473 bytes -->}}</ref>

Peirce reserved the spelling "aesthetics" for the study of artistic beauty.

==Philosophy: Logic, or semiotic==
{{Semiotics}}
===Logic as philosophical===
For Peirce, logic, as such, is a division of philosophy; is a normative science, after esthetics and ethics; and is "the art of devising methods of research"<ref>Quote from Peirce, C.S., 1882, "Introductory Lecture on the Study of Logic" delivered September 1882, ''Johns Hopkins University Circulars'', vol. 2, no. 19, pp. 11-12, November 1892, Google Book Search Beta [http://books.google.com/books?id=E0YFAAAAQAAJ&pg=PA11&dq=%22art+of+devising+methods+of+research%22 Eprint], users outside the USA may not yet be able to gain full access. Reprinted (EP 1:214-214; W 4:378-382; CP 7.59-76).</ref>. More generally, as inference, "logic is rooted in the social principle"<ref>"The Doctrine of Chances", ''Popular Science Monthly'', v. 12, pp. 604-615, 1878 (CP 2.645-668, W 3:276-290, EP 1:142-154). "...death makes the number of our risks, the number of our inferences, finite, and so makes their mean result uncertain. The very idea of probability and of reasoning rests on the assumption that this number is indefinitely great. .... ...logicality inexorably requires that our interests shall ''not'' be limited. .... Logic is rooted in the social principle."</ref> Peirce called (with no sense of deprecation) "mathematics of logic" much of the kind of thing which, in current research and applications, is called simply "logic". He was productive in both logic and its mathematics, which were connected deeply in his work and thought.
====Presuppositions of logic====
In his "F.R.L." [First Rule of Logic] (1899), he states that the first, and "in one sense, this sole", rule of reason is that, ''in order to learn, one needs to desire to learn'' and desire it without resting satisfied with that which one is inclined to think.<ref name=FRL>Peirce (1899), "F.R.L." [First Rule of Logic], CP 1.135-140, [http://www.princeton.edu/~batke/peirce/frl_99.htm Eprint]</ref> So, the first rule is, ''to wonder''. Peirce proceeds to a critical theme in the shaping of theories, not to mention associated practices:
:...there follows one corollary which itself deserves to be inscribed upon every wall of the city of philosophy:
<center>Do not block the way of inquiry.</center>
Peirce adds, that method and economy are best in research but no outright sin inheres in trying any theory in the sense that the investigation via its trial adoption can proceed unimpeded and undiscouraged, and that "the one unpardonable offence" is a philosophical barricade against truth's advance, an offense to which "metaphysicians in all ages have shown themselves the most addicted". Peirce in many writings holds that logic precedes metaphysics (ontological, religious, and physical).<ref>See [[Classification of the sciences (Peirce)]].</ref>

Peirce goes on to list four common barriers to inquiry: (1) Assertion of absolute certainty; (2) maintaining that something is absolutely unknowable; (3) maintaining that something is absolutely inexplicable because absolutely basic or ultimate; (4) holding that perfect exactitude is possible, especially such as to quite preclude unusual and anomalous phenomena. To refuse absolute certainty is the heart of ''fallibilism'', which Peirce unfolds into refusals to set up any of the listed barriers. Peirce elsewhere argues (1897) that logic's presupposition of fallibilism leads at length to the view that chance and continuity are very real ([[tychism]] and synechism).<ref>For a fuller discussion by Peirce of fallibilism and its powerful ramifications, see "Fallibilism, Continuity, and Evolution", 1897, CP 1.141-175 ([http://www.textlog.de/4248.html Eprint]), which the ''Collected Papers''<U+2019>s editors placed directly after "F.R.L." (1899, CP 1.135-140).</ref>

One might have thought that, as a whole, the topic belongs within theory of inquiry ("Methodeutic" or "Philosophical or Speculative Rhetoric"), his third department of logic; but the First Rule of Logic pertains to the mind's presuppositions in undertaking reason and logic, presuppositions, for instance, that there are truth and real things independent of what you or I think of them.<ref name=truth>Peirce offered a sophisticated definition of truth in tandem with his definition of the real, as presuppositions of reason, all by way of example in his exposition of pragmatic logical method. See [[Pragmaticism]] and also the many passages by Peirce quoted under "Truth" and "Real, Reality" at [http://www.helsinki.fi/science/commens/dictionary.html CDPT].</ref> He describes such ideas as, collectively, hopes which, in particular cases, one is unable seriously to doubt.<ref>Peirce (1902), The Carnegie Institute Application, Memoir 10, MS L75.361-362, ''Arisbe'' [http://www.cspeirce.com/menu/library/bycsp/l75/ver1/l75v1-04.htm#m10 Eprint].</ref> Peirce's view that there is no way to conceive of the absolutely incognizable leads to his rejecting the conception (usually ascribed to Kant) of the unknowable thing-in-itself.

====Logic as formal semiotic====
Peirce's semiotic is philosophical logic studied in terms of signs and sign processes. Often using examples from common experience, Peirce defines and discusses things like assertions and interpretations in terms of philosophical logic rather than of psychology or social studies. In a formal vein, Peirce says:

<blockquote>
''On the Definition of Logic''. Logic is ''formal semiotic''. A sign is something, ''A'', which brings something, ''B'', its ''interpretant'' sign, determined or created by it, into the same sort of correspondence (or a lower implied sort) with something, ''C'', its ''object'', as that in which itself stands to ''C''. This definition no more involves any reference to human thought than does the definition of a line as the place within which a particle lies during a lapse of time. It is from this definition that I deduce the principles of logic by mathematical reasoning, and by mathematical reasoning that, I aver, will support criticism of [[Weierstrass]]ian severity, and that is perfectly evident. The word "formal" in the definition is also defined. (Peirce, "Carnegie Application", NEM 4:54).
</blockquote>

Peirce called his general study of signs ''[[semiotic]]'' or ''[[semeiotic]]''. Both terms are current in both singular and plural forms.<ref>Regarding the evolution of the word "semiotic" and its spellings, see [[Semeiotic#Literature]].</ref> Peirce began writing on semiotic in the 1860s, around the time that he devised his system of three categories. From the beginning he based his semiotic on the understanding of a [[triadic relation|triadic]] [[sign relation]]. His 1907 definition of ''[[semiosis]]'' is "action, or influence, which is, or involves, a cooperation of ''three'' subjects, such as a sign, its object, and its interpretant, this tri-relative influence not being in any way resolvable into actions between pairs".<ref>Peirce 1907, CP 5.484. Reprinted (EP 2:411 in "Pragmatism," 398-433).</ref>

====Dynamics of inquiry====
<blockquote>
Every mind which passes from doubt to belief must have ideas which follow after one another in time. Every mind which reasons must have ideas which not only follow after others but are caused by them. Every mind which is capable of logical criticism of its inferences, must be aware of this determination of its ideas by previous ideas. (Peirce, "On Time and Thought", W 3:68<U+2013>69.)
</blockquote>

Throughout the 1860s, the young but rapidly maturing Peirce was busy establishing a conceptual base camp and a technical supply line for a lifetime's intellectual adventures. In the long view, among best titles for the story, it all seems to have something to do with the [[dynamics of inquiry]]. This broad subject area has a part given by [[nature]] and a part ruled by [[nurture]]. On first approach, one can see a question of [[articulation]] and a question of [[explanation]]:

:* What is needed to articulate the workings of the active form of [[Representation (psychology)|representation]] that is known as ''conscious experience''?

:* What is needed to account for the workings of the reflective discipline of [[inquiry]] that is known as ''science''?

The pursuit of these questions finds them entangled together and finally incomprehensible apart from each other, but for exposition's sake it is convenient to organize a study of Peirce's assault on the ''summa'' by following first the trails of thought that led him to develop a ''theory of signs'' ('[[semiotic]]'), and tracking next the ways of thinking that led him to develop within it a ''[[#Theory of inquiry|theory of inquiry]]'', one that would be up to the task of saying 'how science works'.

Opportune points of departure for exploring the dynamics of representation, such as led to Peirce's theories of [[inference]] and [[information]], [[inquiry]] and [[Sign (semiotics)|sign]]s, are those that he took for his own springboards. Perhaps the most significant influences radiate from points on parallel lines of inquiry in [[Aristotle]]'s work, points where the intellectual forerunner focused on many of the same issues and even came to strikingly similar conclusions, at least about the best ways to begin. To keep on course to a more solid basis for understanding Peirce, it serves to consider the following ''loci'' in [[Aristotle]]:

:* The basic terminology of [[psychology]], in ''[[On the Soul]]''.

:* The founding description of [[sign relation]]s, in ''[[On Interpretation]]'';

:* The differentiation of the genus of reasoning into three species of [[inference]] that are commonly translated into English as ''[[Abductive reasoning|abduction]]'', ''[[Deductive reasoning|deduction]]'', and ''[[Induction (philosophy)|induction]]'', in the ''[[Prior Analytics]]''.

In addition to the three elements of [[inference]], that Peirce would assay to be [[irreducible]], [[Aristotle]] analyzed several types of compound inference, most importantly the type known as 'reasoning by [[analogy]]' or 'reasoning from [[example]]', employing for the latter description the Greek word '<span la=grc>paradeigma</span>', from which we get our word '[[paradigm]]'.

Inquiry is a form of reasoning process; it institutes a specially conducted way, manner, style, or turn of thinking. Philosophers of the school that is commonly called 'pragmatic' hold with Peirce that "all thought is in signs",<ref>"To say, therefore, that thought cannot happen in an instant, but requires a time, is but another way of saying that every thought must be interpreted in another, or that all thought is in signs." Peirce, 1868, "Questions Concerning Certain Faculties Claimed for Man", ''Journal of Speculative Philosophy'' vol. 2 (1868), pp. 103-114. Reprinted (CP 5.213-263, the quote is from para. 253). ''Arisbe'' [http://www.cspeirce.com/menu/library/bycsp/question/qu-frame.htm Eprint].</ref> where 'sign' is the word for the broadest conceivable variety of indices, semblances, signals, symbols, formulas, texts, and so on up the line, that might be imagined. Even intellectual concepts and mental ideas are held to be a special class of signs, corresponding to internal states of the thinking agent that both issue in and result from the interpretation of external signs.

The subsumption of inquiry within reasoning in general and the inclusion of thinking within the class of sign processes let us approach the subject of inquiry from two different perspectives:

:* The ''[[syllogistic]]'' approach treats inquiry as a species of logical process, and is limited to those of its aspects that can be related to the most basic laws of inference.

:* The ''sign-theoretic'' approach views inquiry as a genus of ''[[semiosis]]'', an activity taking place within the more general setting of [[sign relation]]s and sign processes.

The distinction between signs denoting and objects denoted is critical to the discussion of Peirce's theory of signs.

===Signs===
====Sign relation====
Anything is a sign <U+2014> not absolutely as itself, but instead in some relation or other. The ''[[sign relation]]'' is the key. It defines three roles encompassing (1) the sign, (2) the sign's subject matter, called its ''object'', and (3) the sign's meaning or ramification as formed into a kind of effect called its ''interpretant'' (a further sign, for example a translation). It is an irreducible ''[[triadic relation]]'', according to Peirce. The roles are distinct even when the things that fill those roles are not.

''Extension <U+00D7> intension = information.'' The triadic relation requires an understanding of ''[[Relation (mathematics)|relation]]'' as such. Two traditional approaches, necessary though insufficient, are the way of ''[[Extension (semantics)|extension]]'' (a sign's objects, also called breadth or denotation) and the way of ''[[intension]]'' (a sign's meaning, also called depth, [[Comprehension (logic)|Comprehension]], signification, or nowadays connotation). Peirce adds a third, the way of ''[[Semiotic information theory|information]]'', including change of information, in order to integrate the other two approaches into a unified whole. For example, if the total amount of information stays the same, then the more that a term signifies or 'intends' about things, the fewer become the things to which it 'extends' or applies.<ref>Peirce, C. S. (1867), "Upon Logical Comprehension and Extension", ''Proceedings of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences'', pp. 416-432. Presented 13 November 1867. Reprinted (CP 2.391-426), (W 2:70-86, PEP [http://www.iupui.edu/~peirce/writings/v2/w2/w2_06/v2_06.htm Eprint]).</ref>

''Determination.'' A sign depends on its object in such a way as to represent its object <U+2014> the object determines the sign. A physically causal sense of this stands out especially when a sign consists in an indicative reaction. The interpretant depends likewise on both the sign and the object <U+2014> the object determines the sign to determine the interpretant. It is not like a row of toppling dominoes, a succession of dyadic events; sign determination is triadic. For example, an interpretant does not merely represent something which represented an object; instead an interpretant represents something ''as'' a sign representing an object. It is an informational kind of determination, a rendering of something more determinately representative.<ref name=determined>See Peirce, C. S. (1868), "What Is Meant By 'Determined'", ''Journal of Speculative Philosophy'' v. 2, n. 3, pp. 190-191. Reprinted (CP 6.625-630), (W 2:155-157, PEP [http://www.iupui.edu/~peirce/writings/v2/w2/w2_16/v2_16.htm Eprint])."</ref> It is not strictly deterministic, and varies in measure, like an influence. Peirce defines sign, object, and interpretant by their (triadic) mode of determination, not by the idea of representation, since that is part of what is being defined.<ref>Peirce, C.S., "A Letter to Lady Welby" (1908), ''Semiotic and Significs'', pp. 80-81: <blockquote><font size=2>I define a Sign as anything which is so determined by something else, called its Object, and so determines an effect upon a person, which effect I call its Interpretant, that the latter is thereby mediately determined by the former. My insertion of "upon a person" is a sop to Cerberus, because I despair of making my own broader conception understood.</font></blockquote></ref>

====Semiotic elements====
{{main|Semiotic elements and classes of signs (Peirce)}}

Peirce held there are exactly three basic elements in semiosis (sign action):
#A ''sign'' (or ''representamen''<ref>"Representamen" (properly with the "a" long and stressed: {{pronEng|r<U+025B>pr<U+0259>z<U+025B>n<U+02C8>te<U+026A>m<U+0259>n}}) is Peirce's adopted ([[wiktionary:representamen|not coined]]) technical term for the ''sign'' as covered in his theory. Peirce used the technical term in case a divergence should come to light between his theoretical version and the popular senses of the word "sign". He eventually stopped using "representamen". See EP 2:272-3 and ''Semiotic and Significs'' p. 193, quotes in [http://www.helsinki.fi/science/commens/terms/representamen.html Representamen] at [http://www.helsinki.fi/science/commens/dictionary.html CDPT].</ref>) represents, in the broadest possible sense of "represents". It is something interpretable as saying something about something. It is not necessarily symbolic, linguistic, or artificial.
#An ''object'' (or ''semiotic object'') is a subject matter of a sign and an interpretant. It can be anything discussable or thinkable, a thing, event, relationship, quality, law, argument, etc., and can even be fictional, for instance Hamlet.<ref name=fictive>Peirce (1909), A Letter to William James, EP 2:498, viewable at [http://www.helsinki.fi/science/commens/dictionary.html CDPT] under [http://www.helsinki.fi/science/commens/terms/dynamicalobject.html Dynamical Object]</ref> All of those are special or partial objects. The object most accurately is the [[universe of discourse]] to which the partial or special object belongs.<ref>Peirce (1909), A Letter to William James, EP 2:492, viewable at [http://www.helsinki.fi/science/commens/dictionary.html CDPT] under "[http://www.helsinki.fi/science/commens/terms/object.html Object]".</ref> For instance, a perturbation of Pluto's orbit is a sign about Pluto but ultimately not only about Pluto.
#An ''interpretant'' (or ''interpretant sign'') is the sign's more or less clarified meaning or ramification, a kind of form or idea of the difference which the sign's being true or undeceptive would make. (Peirce's sign theory concerns meaning in the broadest sense, including logical implication, not just the meanings of words as properly clarified by a dictionary.) The interpretant is a sign (a) of the object and (b) of the interpretant's "predecessor" (the interpreted sign) as being a sign of the same object. The interpretant is an ''interpretation'' in the sense of a ''product'' of an interpretive process or a content in which an interpretive relation culminates, though this product or content may itself be an act, a state of agitation, a conduct, etc. Such is what is meant in saying that the sign stands ''for'' the object ''to'' the interpretant.
Some of the understanding needed by the mind depends on familiarity with the object. In order to know what a given sign denotes, the mind needs some experience of that sign's object collaterally to that sign or sign system, and in that context Peirce speaks of collateral experience, collateral observation, collateral acquaintance, all in much the same terms.<ref>See pp. 404-409 in "Pragmatism", ''The Essential Peirce''. Ten quotes on collateral observation from Peirce provided by Joseph Ransdell can be viewed [http://lyris.ttu.edu/read/messages?id=57101#57101 here] at peirce-l's Lyris archive. Note: Ransdell's quotes from the ''Collected Papers'' vol. 8, pp. 178-179, are also in ''The Essential Peirce'', vol. 2, pp. 493-4, which gives their date as 1909; and his quote from ''Collected Papers'', vol. 8, p. 183, is also in ''The Essential Peirce'', vol. 2, pp. 495-6, which gives its date as 1909''.</ref>

The object determines (not in the deterministic sense, but in a sense of "specializes," ''bestimmt''<ref name=determined />) the sign to determine another sign <U+2014> the interpretant <U+2014> to be related to the object ''as the sign is related to the object'', hence the interpretant, fulfilling its function as sign of the object, determines a further interpretant sign. The process is logically structured to perpetuate itself, and is definitive of sign, object, and interpretant in general.

For further discussion of sign, object, and interpretant, see [[Sign relations]] and the main article [[Semiotic elements and classes of signs (Peirce)]].

====Classes of signs====
{{main|Semiotic elements and classes of signs (Peirce)}}

Among Peirce's many sign typologies, three stand out, interlocked. They depend respectively on (I) the sign itself, (II) the sign's relation to its denoted object, and (III) the sign's relation to its object and to its interpretant. Additionally, each of the three typologies is a three-way division, a trichotomy, via Peirce's three phenomenological [[#Theory of categories|categories]]. One typology classifies the sign by the sign's own category. A second classifies the sign by the category of the sign's way of denoting its object. The third classifies the sign by the category which the sign's interpretant attributes to the sign's way of denoting the object.

I. ''Qualisign, sinsign, legisign'' (also called'' tone, token, type,'' and also called ''potisign, actisign, famisign''): This typology emphasizes the sign itself in terms of the phenomenological category which it embodies -- the qualisign is a quality, a possibility, a "First"; the sinsign is a reaction or resistance, a singular object, an actual event or fact, a "Second"; and the legisign is a habit, a rule, a representational relation, a "Third".

II. ''Icon, index, symbol'': This typology, the best known one, emphasizes the different ways in which the sign refers to its object -- the icon (also called semblance or likeness) by a quality of its own, the index by real connection to its object, and the symbol by a habit or rule for its interpretant.

III. ''Rheme, dicisign, argument'' (also called ''sumisign, dicisign, suadisign,'' also ''seme, pheme, delome,'' and regarded as very broadened versions of the traditional ''term, proposition, argument''): This typology emphasizes that which the interpretant represents to be the sign's way of referring to its object -- the rheme, for example a term, is a sign interpreted to represent its object in respect of quality; the dicisign, for example a proposition, is a sign interpreted to represent its object in respect of fact; and the argument is a sign interpreted to represent its object in respect of habit or law. This is the culminating typology of the three, where the sign is understood as a structural element of inference.

Every sign falls under one class or another within (I) ''and'' within (II) ''and'' within (III). Thus each of the three typologies is a three-valued parameter for every sign. The three parameters are not independent of each other; many co-classifications aren't found, for reasons pertaining to the lack of either habit-taking or singular reaction in a quality, and the lack of habit-taking in a singular reaction. The result is not 27 but instead ten classes of signs fully specified at this level of analysis.

===Modes of inference===
{{main|Inquiry}}
Borrowing a brace of concepts from [[Aristotle]], Peirce examined three basic modes of reasoning that play roles in inquiry, processes currently known as ''[[abductive]]'', ''[[deductive]]'', and ''[[Inductive reasoning|inductive]]'' [[inference]]. Peirce also called abduction "retroduction" and, earliest of all, "hypothesis". He characterized it as guessing and as inference to the best explanation. Peirce sometimes expounded the modes of inference by transformations of the classical Barbara (AAA) syllogism, for example in "Deduction, Induction, and Hypothesis" (1878, see CP 2:623). He does this by rearranging the ''rule'' (which serves as deduction's major premiss), the ''case'' (deduction's minor premiss), and the ''result'' (deduction's conclusion):

{|
|- vAlign=top
|Deduction.

''Rule:'' All the beans from this bag are white. <br>
''Case:'' These beans are from this bag. <br>
<math>\therefore</math> ''Result:'' These beans are white.
| style="padding-left:.4em;padding-right:.4em"| Induction.

''Case:'' These beans are &#91;randomly selected&#93; from this bag. <br>
''Result:'' These beans are white. <br>
<math>\therefore</math> ''Rule:'' All the beans from this bag are white.
|Hypothesis (Abduction).

''Rule:'' All the beans from this bag are white. <br>
''Result:'' These beans are white. <br>
<math>\therefore</math> ''Case:'' These beans are from this bag.
|}

Not quite satisfied, Peirce retracted in 1902 his 1883 attempt in "A Theory of Probable Inference" (''[[Charles Sanders Peirce bibliography#SIL|Studies in Logic]]'') to conceive of hypothetical inference as induction of characters of objects, and presented in 1903 the following logical form for abductive inference<ref>Relevant quotes available under [http://www.helsinki.fi/science/commens/terms/abduction.html Abduction] at [http://www.helsinki.fi/science/commens/dictionary.html CDPT]: On correction of "A Theory of Probable Inference", see the quotes from "Minute Logic", CP 2.102, c. 1902, and from the Carnegie Application (L75), 1902, ''Historical Perspectives on Peirce's Logic of Science'' v. 2, pp. 1031-1032. On new logical form for abduction, see the quote from "Harvard Lectures on Pragmatism", 1903, CP 5.189.<br> See also Santaella, Lucia (c. 2004) "The Development of Peirce's Three Types of Reasoning: Abduction, Deduction, and Induction". [http://www.pucsp.br/~lbraga/epap_peir1.htm Eprint].</ref>:
<blockquote>The surprising fact, C, is observed; 
:But if A were true, C would be a matter of course, 
:Hence, there is reason to suspect that A is true.</blockquote>
Note that the logical form does not also cover induction, since induction does not depend on surprise and does not introduce a new idea in its conclusion. Abduction seeks a hypothesis to account for facts; induction seeks facts to test a hypothesis. Peirce now regarded abduction as plainly preparatory to further study and inference.

In his methodeutic or theory of inquiry (see below), Peirce discusses the three modes as coordinated to play essential roles in inquiry and science, with [[abductive reasoning|abduction]] generating a <em>possible</em> [[hypothesis]] to account for a surprising phenomenon, [[deductive reasoning|deduction]] clarifying the relevant <em>necessary</em> predictive consequences of the hypothesis, and [[inductive reasoning|induction]] testing the sum of the predictions against the sum of the data to show something <em>actually</em> in operation.<ref>"Deduction proves that something <em>must</em> be; Induction shows that something <em>actually is</em> operative; Abduction merely suggests that something <em>may be</em>." "Lectures on Pragmatism", 1903, CP 5.171.</ref>

===Pragmatism===
{{main|Pragmaticism|Pragmatic maxim}}

Peirce's recipe for pragmatic thinking, called both ''[[pragmatism]]'' and ''[[pragmaticism]]'', is recapitulated in several versions of the so-called ''[[pragmatic maxim]]''. Here is one of his more emphatic reiterations of it:

<blockquote>
Consider what effects that might <em>conceivably</em> have practical bearings you <em>conceive</em> the objects of your </em>conception</em> to have. Then, your <em>conception</em> of those effects is the whole of your <em>conception</em> of the object.<ref>See p. 481 in Peirce, C.&nbsp;S. (1905), "Issues of Pragmaticism", The ''Monist'', vol. 15, pp. 481-499, ''Google Book Search Beta'' [http://books.google.com/books?id=j6oLAAAAIAAJ&pg=1#PRA3-PA481,M1 Eprint], ''Internet Archive'' [http://www.archive.org/details/monistquart15hegeuoft Eprint]. Reprinted (CP 5.438-463, see 438), (''Charles S. Peirce: Selected Writings'', pp. 203-226)</ref>
</blockquote>

[[William James]], among others, regarded two of Peirce's papers, "[http://www.peirce.org/writings/p107.html The Fixation of Belief]" (1877) and "[[s:How to Make Our Ideas Clear|How to Make Our Ideas Clear]]" (1878) as [[pragmatism]]'s origin. Peirce conceived pragmatism as a method for clarifying the meaning of difficult [[idea]]s through application of the [[pragmatic maxim]]. He differed from William James and the early [[John Dewey]], in some of their tangential enthusiasms, in being decidedly more rationalistic and realistic, in several senses of those terms, throughout the preponderance of his own philosophical moods.

Peirce's pragmatism is a method of sorting out conceptual confusions by equating the meaning of any concept with the conceivable operational or practical consequences of whatever it is which the concept portrays. This pragmatism bears no resemblance to "vulgar" pragmatism, which misleadingly connotes a ruthless and [[Machiavelli]]an search for mercenary or political advantage. Rather, Peirce's pragmatic maxim is the heart of his pragmatism as a method of experimentational mental [[Pragmatic Maxim#6|reflection]]<ref>Peirce (1902), CP 5.13 note 1</ref> arriving at conceptions in terms of conceivable confirmatory and disconfirmatory circumstances<U+2014>a method hospitable to the generation of explanatory hypotheses, and conducive to the employment and improvement of verification<ref>See CP 1.34 [http://www.textlog.de/4220.html Eprint] (in "The Spirit of Scholasticism"), where Peirce attributes the success of modern science not so much to a novel interest in verification as to the improvement of verification.</ref> to test the truth of putative knowledge. As such a method, pragmatism leads beyond the usual duo of foundational alternatives, namely:
:* [[Deductive reasoning|Deduction]] from self-evident truths, or ''[[rationalism]]'';

:* [[Inductive reasoning|Induction]] from experiential phenomena, or ''[[empiricism]]''.

His approach is distinct from [[foundationalism]], empiricist or otherwise, as well as from [[coherentism]], by the following three dimensions:

:* Active process of theory generation, with no prior assurance of truth;

:* Subsequent application of the contingent theory, aimed toward developing its logical and practical consequences;

:* Evaluation of the provisional theory's utility for the ''[[anticipation]]'' of future experience, and that in dual senses of the word: ''[[prediction]]'' and ''control''. Peirce's identification of these three dimensions serves to flesh out an approach to inquiry far more solid than the standard image of simple inductive generalization as describing a pattern observed in phenomena. Peirce's pragmatism was the first time the [[scientific method]] was proposed as an [[epistemology]] for philosophical questions.

A theory that proves itself more successful than its rivals in predicting and controlling our world is said to be nearer the truth. This is an operational notion of truth employed by scientists. Peirce held, that the scientific method is the best for theoretical questions but not always better than tradition, instinct, etc., for time-sensitive practical questions, but will in the long run produce the most secure results on which action can ultimately be based.

In "[[s:How to Make Our Ideas Clear|How to Make Our Ideas Clear]]", Peirce discusses three grades of clearness of conception: <br>
:1. Clearness of the familiar conception.
:2. Clearness as of a definition's parts, the clearness in virtue of which logicians call a concept or definition "distinct".
:3. Clearness in virtue of clearness of conceivable consequences of the object as conceived of. Here he introduced that which he later called the [[Pragmatic maxim|Pragmatic Maxim]].

By way of example of how to clarify conceptions, he addresses truth and the real as questions of the [[#Presuppositions of logic|presuppositions of reasoning]] in general. In clearness's second grade, he defines truth as a sign's correspondence to its object, and the real as the object of such correspondence, such that truth and the real are independent of that which you or I or any definite [[Community of inquiry|community of researchers]] think. Then in clearness's third grade (the pragmatic grade), he defines the truth as that which would be reached, sooner or later but still inevitably, by research adequately prolonged, such that the real does depend on that final opinion<U+2014>a dependence to which he appeals in theoretical arguments elsewhere, for instance for the long-term validity of the rule of induction.<ref name=Induction>"That the rule of induction will hold good in the long run may be deduced from the principle that reality is only the object of the final opinion to which sufficient investigation would lead", in Peirce, C.&nbsp;S. (1878 April), "The Probability of Induction", p. 718 in ''Popular Science Monthly'', vol. 12, pp. 705-718.

''Internet Archive'' ''[http://www.archive.org/details/popscimonthly12yoummiss Popular Science Monthly 12]''.</ref> Peirce argues that even to argue against the independence and discoverability of truth and the real is to presuppose that there is, about that very question under argument, a truth with just such independence and discoverability. For more on Peirce's theory of truth, see the Peirce section in [[Pragmatic theory of truth#Peirce|Pragmatic Theory of Truth]].

Peirce's pragmatism, as method and theory of ''definitions and the clearness of ideas'', is a department within his theory of inquiry,<ref>See [http://www.cspeirce.com/homepage/ransdell.htm Joseph Ransdell]'s comments and his tabular list of titles of Peirce's proposed list of memoirs in 1902 for his Carnegie application, [http://www.cspeirce.com/menu/library/bycsp/l75/intro/l75intro.htm Eprint]</ref> which he variously called "Methodeutic" and "Philosophical or Speculative Rhetoric". He applied his pragmatism as a method throughout his work. For further discussion see the main articles [[Pragmaticism]] and [[Pragmatic maxim]].

====Theory of inquiry====
{{main|Inquiry}}

In [[s:The Fixation of Belief|The Fixation of Belief]] (1877), Peirce outlined four methods of inquiry and settling belief: (1) the method of tenacity (sticking with that which one is inclined to think), (2) the method of authority, (3) the method of congruity or the a priori or the dilettante or "what is agreeable to reason" (which leads to argumentation which gets finally nowhere), and (4) the method of science. Peirce held that, in practical affairs, slow and stumbling ratiocination is often dangerously inferior to instinct, sentiment, and tradition, and that the scientific method is best suited to theoretical research,<ref>"Philosophy and the Conduct of Life", 1898, Lecture 1 of the Cambridge (MA) Conferences Lectures, published CP 1.616-48 in part and in ''Reasoning and the Logic of Things'', Ketner (ed., intro.) and Putnam (intro., comm.), 105-22, reprinted in EP 2:27-41.</ref> which in turn should not be bound to the other methods and practical ends; yet what recommends scientific method above others finally is that it is deliberately designed to arrive, eventually, at the most secure beliefs, upon which the most successful actions can eventually be based.

Peirce extracted the pragmatic [[mental model|model]] or [[theory]] of [[inquiry]] from its raw materials in classical logic and refined it in parallel with the early development of symbolic logic to address problems about the nature of scientific reasoning.

Abduction, deduction, and induction do not make complete sense in isolation from each other but comprise a cycle understandable as a whole insofar as they collaborate toward the [[end of inquiry]]. In the pragmatic way of thinking in terms of conceivable consequences, every thing has a [[purpose]], and a thing's purpose is the first thing that we should try to note about it. [[Inquiry]]'s purpose is to reduce [[doubt]] and lead to a state of [[belief]], which a person in that state will usually call '[[knowledge]]' or '[[certainty]]'. The three kinds of inference function systematically to reduce the uncertainties and difficulties that occasioned the inquiry, and thus, to the extent that inquiry succeeds, lead to an increase in the [[knowledge]] or [[skills]], in other words an [[augmentation]] in the [[competence]] or [[performance]] of the agent or community engaged in the inquiry.

For instance, [[abductive reasoning|abduction]]'s purpose is to generate guesses that [[deductive reasoning|deduction]] can explicate and that [[inductive reasoning|induction]] can evaluate. This places mild but meaningful [[Constraint (mathematics)|constraint]]s of plausibility, practical testability, and so on, on the production of hypotheses, since it is not just any wild guess at [[explanation]] that submits itself to reason and bows out when defeated in a match with [[reality]], and the logic of abduction gets involved with the economy of research.<ref>See MS L75.329-330, from Draft D of [http://www.cspeirce.com/menu/library/bycsp/l75/ver1/l75v1-08.htm#m27 Memoir 27] of Peirce's application to the Carnegie Institution:
<blockquote><font size=2>Consequently, to discover is simply to expedite an event that would occur sooner or later, if we had not troubled ourselves to make the discovery. Consequently, the art of discovery is purely a question of economics. The economics of research is, so far as logic is concerned, the leading doctrine with reference to the art of discovery. Consequently, the conduct of abduction, which is chiefly a question of heuretic and is the first question of heuretic, is to be governed by economical considerations.</font></blockquote>
</ref> Likewise, each of the other types of [[inference]] realizes its purpose only in accord with its proper role in the whole [[cycle of inquiry]]. No matter how much it may be necessary to study these processes in abstraction from each other, the [[integrity]] of inquiry places strong limitations on the effective [[modularity (programming)|modularity]] of its principal components.

The ensuing question, 'What sort of [[Constraint (mathematics)|constraint]], exactly, does pragmatic thinking of the end of inquiry place on our guesses?', is generally recognized as the problem of 'giving a rule to [[Abductive reasoning|abduction]]'. Peirce's overall answer was the [[pragmatic maxim]]. In 1903 Peirce called the question of pragmatism "the question of the logic of abduction".<ref>Peirce, C.&nbsp;S. (1903), "Pragmatism -- The Logic of Abduction", CP 5.195-205, especially para. 196. [http://www.textlog.de/7663.html Eprint].</ref>

Peirce characterized the scientific method as follows:<ref name=Neglected>Peirce, C.S. (1908), "A Neglected Argument for the Reality of God", published in part, ''Hibbert Journal'' v. 7, 90-112, [[s:A Neglected Argument for the Reality of God|''Hibbert Journal'' version]], also at  ''Internet Archive'' [http://www.archive.org/details/hibbertjournal07londuoft Eprint]. Reprinted with one or another unpublished part in CP 6.452-485, ''Selected Writings'' pp. 358-379, EP 2:434-450, ''Peirce on Signs'' pp. 260-278. [http://users.xplornet.com/~gnox/CSPgod.htm#na1 Eprint].</ref>

1. '''Abduction''' (or retroduction). Generation of explanatory hypothesis. From abduction, Peirce distinguishes induction as inferring, on the basis of tests, the proportion of truth in the hypothesis. Every inquiry, whether into ideas, brute facts, or norms and laws, arises in the effort to resolve the wonder of surprising observations in the given realm or realms. All explanatory content of theories is reached by way of abduction, the most insecure among modes of inference. Induction as a process is far too slow for that job, so economy of research demands abduction, whose modicum of success depends on one's being somehow attuned to nature, by dispositions learned and, some of them, likely inborn. Abduction has general inductive justification in that it works often enough and that nothing else works, at least not quickly enough when science is already properly rather slow, the work of indefinitely many generations. Given that abduction relies on inborn or developed instinct attuned to nature and is driven by the need to economize the inquiry process, its explanatory hypotheses should be optimally simple in the sense of "natural" (for which Peirce cites Galileo and which Peirce distinguishes from "logically simple"). Given that abduction is insecure guesswork, it should have consequences with conceivable practical bearing leading at least to mental tests, and, in science, lending themselves to scientific testing.

2. '''Deduction'''. Analysis of hypothesis and deduction of its consequences in order to test the hypothesis. Two stages:
:i. Explication. Logical analysis of the hypothesis in order to render it as distinct as possible.
:ii. Demonstration (or deductive argumentation). Deduction of hypothesis's consequence. Corollarial or, if needed, Theorematic.

3. '''Induction'''. The long-run validity of the rule of induction is deducible from the principle (presuppositional to reasoning in general) that the real "is only the object of the final opinion to which sufficient investigation would lead".<ref name="Induction" /> In other words, if there were something to which an inductive process involving ongoing tests or observations would <em>never</em> lead, then that thing would not be real. Three stages:
:i. Classification. Classing objects of experience under general ideas.
:ii. Probation (or direct Inductive Argumentation): Crude (the enumeration of instances) or Gradual (new estimate of proportion of truth in the hypothesis after each test). Gradual Induction is Qualitative or Quantitative; if Quantitative, then dependent on measurements, or on statistics, or on countings.
:iii. Sentential Induction. "...which, by Inductive reasonings, appraises the different Probations singly, then their combinations, then makes self-appraisal of these very appraisals themselves, and passes final judgment on the whole result".<ref name="Neglected" />

==Philosophy: Metaphysics==
In ontology, Peirce declared himself Scholastic Realist about generals early on. Eventually he embraced Scholastic Realism about modalities (possibility, necessity, etc.) as well, holding that the modalities are real and not mere functions of one's ignorance.

Peirce believed in God, and characterized such belief as founded in an instinct explorable in musing over the worlds of ideas, brute facts, and evolving norms <U+2014> and it is a belief in God not as an <em>actual</em> or <em>existent</em> being (in Peirce's sense of those words), but all the same as a <em>real</em> being.<ref name=Godasreal>Peirce in his 1906 "Answers to Questions concerning my Belief in God", CP 6.495, [http://users.xplornet.com/~gnox/CSPgod.htm Eprint], reprinted in part as "The Concept of God" in ''Philosophical Writings of Peirce'', J. Buchler, ed., 1940, pp. 375-378:<blockquote><font size=2>I will also take the liberty of substituting "reality" for "existence." This is perhaps overscrupulosity; but I myself always use <em>exist</em> in its strict philosophical sense of "react with the other like things in the environment." Of course, in that sense, it would be fetichism to say that God "exists." The word "reality," on the contrary, is used in ordinary parlance in its correct philosophical sense. [....] I define the <em>real</em> as that which holds its characters on such a tenure that it makes not the slightest difference what any man or men may have <em>thought</em> them to be, or ever will have <em>thought</em> them to be, here using thought to include, imagining, opining, and willing (as long as forcible <em>means</em> are not used); but the real thing's characters will remain absolutely untouched"</font></blockquote></ref> In "[[Wikisource:A Neglected Argument for the Reality of God|A Neglected Argument for the Reality of God]]" (1908),<ref name="Neglected" /> Peirce sketches, for God's reality, an argument to a hypothesis of God as the Necessary Being, a hypothesis which he describes in terms of how it would tend to develop and become compelling in musement and inquiry by a normal person who is led, by the hypothesis, to consider as being purposed the features of the worlds of ideas, brute facts, and evolving norms, such that the thought of such purposefulness will "stand or fall with the hypothesis"; meanwhile, according to Peirce, the hypothesis, in supposing an "infinitely incomprehensible" being, starts off at odds with its own nature as a purportively true conception, and so, no matter how much the hypothesis grows, it both (A) inevitably regards itself as partly true, partly vague, and as continuing to define itself without limit, and (B) inevitably has God appearing likewise vague but growing, though God as the Necessary Being is not vague or growing; but the hypothesis will hold it to be <em>more</em> false to say the opposite, that God is purposeless.

In physical metaphysics, Peirce held the view, which he called [[objective idealism]], that "matter is effete mind, inveterate habits becoming physical laws".<ref>Peirce, "The Architecture of Theories",'' [[The Monist]]'' 1 (1891), p[http://books.google.com/books?id=waoLAAAAIAAJ&pg=PP19&dq=editions:0-FEObxPhyNOcbY9PVSxXar#PPA161-IA2,M1 p. 161]<U+2013>176, see [http://books.google.com/books?id=waoLAAAAIAAJ&pg=PP19&dq=editions:0-FEObxPhyNOcbY9PVSxXar#PPA170,M1 p. 170], via Google Books). Reprinted (CP 6.7<U+2013>34) and (EP 1:285-297, see p. 293).</ref> Peirce asserted the reality of (1) chance (his tychist view), (2) mechanical necessity (anancist view), and (3) that which he called the law of love (agapist view). They embody his [[#Theory of categories|categories]] Firstness, Secondness, and Thirdness, respectively. He held that fortuitous variation (which he also called "sporting"), mechanical necessity, and creative love are the three modes of evolution (modes called "tychasm", "anancasm", and "agapasm"<ref>See "tychism", "tychasm", "tychasticism", and the rest, at the [http://www.helsinki.fi/science/commens/dictionary.html CDPT].</ref>) of the universe and its parts. He found his conception of agapasm embodied in [[Lamarckism|Lamarckian evolution]]; the overall idea in any case is that of evolution tending toward an end or goal, and it could also be the evolution of a mind or a society; it is the kind of evolution which manifests workings of mind in some general sense. He said that overall he was a synechist, holding with reality of continuity.<ref>Peirce, "Evolutionary Love", The ''Monist'', vol. 3, pp. 176-200 (1893), published as the last paper in a series of five.

==Science of review==
{{main|Classification of the sciences (Peirce)}}
Peirce outlined two fields, "Cenoscopy" and "Science of Review", both of which could be called "philosophy" and both of which included philosophy about science. Peirce distinguished First Philosophy as "Cenoscopy," placed it after mathematics and before special sciences (physical, chemical, biological, psychological, social) among the Sciences of Discovery, and included, within it, the ''general'' study of inquiry and scientific method. Cenoscopic philosophy concerns positive phenomena in general, does not rely on findings from special sciences, and is the kind discussed earlier in this article. Peirce distinguished Ultimate Philosophy as "Science of Review" or "Synthetic Philosophy", placed it between Science of Discovery and Practical Science, and characterized it as "...arranging the results of discovery, beginning with digests, and going on to endeavor to form a philosophy of science". His examples of Science of Review included [[Alexander von Humboldt|Humboldt]]'s ''[[Alexander Von Humboldt#The .22Cosmos.22|Cosmos]]'', [[Auguste Comte|Comte]]'s ''Philosophie positive'', and [[Herbert Spencer|Spencer]]'s ''Synthetic Philosophy''.<ref>Peirce (1903), CP 1.182 [http://www.princeton.edu/~batke/peirce/cl_o_sci_03.htm Eprint] and Peirce (1906) 'The Basis of Pragmaticism', EP 2:372-3, see [http://www.helsinki.fi/science/commens/terms/philosophy.html Philosophy] at [http://www.helsinki.fi/science/commens/dictionary.html CDPT].</ref>

Peirce placed, within Science of Review, the work and theory of classifying the sciences (including mathematics and philosophy). His classifications, on which he worked for many years, draw on argument and wide knowledge, and are of interest both as a map for navigating his philosophy and as an accomplished polymath's survey of research in his time.
