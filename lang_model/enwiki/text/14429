'''Scunthorpe railway station''' serves the town of [[Scunthorpe]] in [[North Lincolnshire]], [[England]].  The station is located a short walk from the town centre on Station Road.

As you approach the station by road, there is a pay and display car park with around 50 spaces, including 2 disabled spaces.  From the car park, it is a short walk to the Ticket Office, which is open between 05:45-19:30, Monday-Saturday, and 08:45-19:30 Sunday.  Close to the entrance, there is a public telephone box.

The station has two platforms, Platform 1 serves mainly eastbound trains toward Grimsby/Cleethorpes, although some [[Northern Rail]] "stopper" services toward Doncaster do use this platform through the day.  All westbound [[First TransPennine Express]] services, and most [[Northern Rail]] services use Platform 2.  This platform is accessible via a bridge over the tracks.

The station has limited seating on both platforms, and three waiting rooms. There are toilets available on Platform 1, which are accessible only by requesting the key from the Ticket Office.  Due to these restrictions, the toilets are kept in a very clean condition, and were awarded the title of ''"Loo of the Year"'' in 2005, under the Railway Stations category.

This is not the original Scunthorpe station. The original station was known as [[Frodingham railway station|Frodingham]] and located over 1/2 mile to the east near the Brigg Road bridge (then a level crossing). It opened in 1864, it was replaced by a second station just 200 yards west from the first in 1887, it was closed when the present station was opened 11th March 1928. For over 40 years the original station was known as "Scunthorpe & Frodingham".

From 1906 the town had another station serving the [[North Lindsey Light Railway]], a line which ran from [[Scunthorpe (Dawes Lane) railway station|Dawes Lane]], about 1/2 mile to the east, to (originally), [[West Halton railway station| West Halton]].
