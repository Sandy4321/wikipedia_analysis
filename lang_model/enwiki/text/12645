'''Iron Maiden''' are an English [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]] band from [[Leyton]] in east London, formed in 1975 by bassist and primary songwriter [[Steve Harris (musician)|Steve Harris]]. Since their inception, the band's [[Iron Maiden discography|discography]] has grown to include a total of thirty-six albums: fifteen studio albums; eleven live albums; four [[Extended play|EPs]]; and six [[compilation album|compilations]].

Pioneers of the [[New Wave of British Heavy Metal]], Iron Maiden achieved success during the early 1980s. After several line-up changes, the band went on to release a series of U.S. and UK platinum and gold albums, including 1982's ''[[The Number of the Beast (album)|The Number of the Beast]]'', 1983's ''[[Piece of Mind]]'', 1984's ''[[Powerslave]]'', 1985's live release ''[[Live After Death]]'', 1986's ''[[Somewhere in Time (Iron Maiden album)|Somewhere in Time]]'' and 1988's ''[[Seventh Son of a Seventh Son]]''. Since the return of lead vocalist [[Bruce Dickinson]] and guitarist [[Adrian Smith]] in 1999, the band have undergone a resurgence in popularity,<ref> {{cite web | url = http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/music/rockandpopfeatures/7915012/Iron-Maiden-doing-it-their-own-way.html | title = Iron Maiden: doing it their own way | accessdate = 24-12-2011 | quote = when Dickinson re-entered the fold in 1999 the band<U+2019>s ensuing career made them bigger than ever}}</ref> with their latest studio offering, ''[[The Final Frontier]]'', peaking at No.&nbsp;1 in 28&nbsp;different countries<ref name="FF 28 quote">{{cite web | url = http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=148709 | title = Iron Maiden Around The World In 66 Days | accessdate = 20-11-2011}}</ref> and receiving widespread critical acclaim.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.metacritic.com/music/the-final-frontier | title=The Final Frontier - Iron Maiden | publisher=MetaCritic | accessdate=01-09-2011}}</ref>

==History==
===Early years (1975<U+2013>1977)===
[[File:Harris 1.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Dave Murray and Steve Harris in 2008. Harris and Murray are the only members to have performed on all of the band's albums.]]
Iron Maiden were formed on Christmas Day 1975, by bassist [[Steve Harris (musician)|Steve Harris]], shortly after he left his previous group, Smiler. Harris attributes the band's name to a film adaptation of ''[[The Man in the Iron Mask (1939 film)|The Man in the Iron Mask]]'' from the novel by [[Alexandre Dumas]], which he saw around that time and which had a verbal connection to the [[iron maiden (torture)|iron maiden torture device]].<ref>{{cite web|last = Barton|first = Geoff|title = Blood and Iron: HM from the punky East End and nothing to do with Margaret Thatcher, sez Deaf Barton|date = 27 October 1970|work=''Sounds'' magazine|url = http://www.nwobhm.com/maiden.htm|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070629075244/http://www.nwobhm.com/maiden.htm|archivedate = 2007-06-29|publisher=NWOBHM.com|accessdate =08-10-2006}}</ref>
The original lineup did not last very long, however, with vocalist [[Paul Day (musician)|Paul Day]] being the first casualty as he lacked "energy or charisma onstage."{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=32}} He was replaced by Dennis Wilcock, a [[Kiss (band)|Kiss]] fan who used make-up and fake blood during live performances.{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=32}} Wilcock's friend [[Dave Murray (musician)|Dave Murray]] was invited to join, to the dismay of the band's guitarists Dave Sullivan and Terry Rance.{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=33}} Their frustration led Harris to temporarily disunite the band in 1976,{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=33}} though the group reformed soon after with Murray as the sole guitarist. Steve Harris and Dave Murray remain the band's longest-standing members and have performed on all of their releases.

Iron Maiden recruited yet another guitarist in 1977, Bob Sawyer, who was sacked for embarrassing the band onstage by pretending to play guitar with his teeth.{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=44}} Tension ensued again, causing a rift between Murray and Wilcock, who convinced Harris to fire Murray,{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=46}} as well as original drummer Ron Matthews.<ref name="earlydaysdvd"/> A new line-up was put together, including [[Tony Moore (musician)|Tony Moore]] on keyboards, Terry Wapram on guitar, and drummer [[Thunderstick|Barry Purkis]]. A bad performance at the Bridgehouse, a pub located in Canning Town,{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=23}} in November 1977, the line-up's first and only concert, led to Purkis being replaced by [[Doug Sampson]].{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=48}} At the same time, Moore was asked to leave as Harris decided that keyboards did not suit the band's sound.{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=48}} Soon afterwards, Dennis Wilcock decided he'd had enough with the group and left to form his own band, V1, and Dave Murray was immediately reinstated.{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=50}} As he preferred to be the band's sole guitarist, Wapram disapproved of Murray's return and was also dismissed.<ref name="earlydaysdvd"/>

Steve Harris, Dave Murray and Doug Sampson promptly began rehearsing while they searched for a singer to complete the band's new line-up.{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=52}} A chance meeting at the Red Lion pub in [[Leytonstone]] evolved into a successful audition for vocalist [[Paul Di'Anno]]. Steve Harris has stated, "There's sort of a quality in Paul's voice, a raspiness in his voice, or whatever you want to call it, that just gave it this great edge."{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=53}} Although, the band were always looking to employ a second, from that point Murray would typically act as their sole guitarist, with Harris commenting that "Davey was so good he could do a lot of it on his own. The plan was always to get a second guitarist in, but finding one that could match Davey was really difficult."{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=64}} 

===Rise to fame (1978<U+2013>1981)===

On New Year's Eve 1978, Iron Maiden recorded a demo, consisting of four songs, at Spaceward Studios in Cambridge.{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=66}} Hoping the recording would help them secure more gigs,{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=66}} the band presented a copy to [[Neal Kay]], then managing a heavy metal club called "Bandwagon Heavy Metal Soundhouse", located in Kingsbury Circle, northwest London.{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=67}} Upon hearing the tape, Kay began playing the demo regularly at the Bandwagon, and one of the songs, "Prowler," eventually went to No.&nbsp;1 in the Soundhouse charts, which were published weekly in ''[[Sounds (magazine)|Sounds]]'' magazine.{{sfn|Wall|2004|pp=104<U+2013>105}} A copy was also acquired by [[Rod Smallwood]], who soon became the band's manager,{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=83}} and, as Iron Maiden's popularity increased, they decided to release the demo on their own record label as "[[The Soundhouse Tapes]]," named after the club.{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=103}} Featuring only three songs (one song, "Strange World", was excluded as the band were unsatisfied with its production){{sfn|Wall|2004|p=102}} all five thousand copies were sold out within weeks.{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=104-105}}

[[File:IRON MAIDEN - Manchester Apollo - 1980.jpg|thumb|160px|right|[[Paul Di'Anno]] and [[Steve Harris (musician)|Steve Harris]] supporting Judas Priest on their British Steel Tour, 1980.]]
In December 1979, the band secured a major record deal with [[EMI]]{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=108}} and asked Dave Murray's childhood friend [[Adrian Smith]] to join the group as their second guitarist.{{sfn|Wall|2004|pp=163<U+2013>164}} Smith declined as he was busy with his own band, [[Urchin (band)|Urchin]], so Iron Maiden hired guitarist [[Dennis Stratton]] instead.{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=121}} Shortly afterwards, [[Doug Sampson]] left due to health issues and was replaced by an ex-[[Samson (band)|Samson]] drummer [[Clive Burr]] at Stratton's suggestion on 26 December.{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=123}} Iron Maiden's first appearance on an album was on the ''[[Metal for Muthas]]'' compilation (released on 15 February 1980) with two early versions of "[[Sanctuary (Iron Maiden song)|Sanctuary]]" and "Wrathchild".{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=137}} The release led to an [[Metal for Muthas Tour|ensuing tour]] which featured several other bands linked with the [[New Wave of British Heavy Metal]].{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=139}}

Iron Maiden's [[eponym]]ous 1980 release, ''[[Iron Maiden (album)|Iron Maiden]]'', debuted at No.&nbsp;4 in the [[UK Albums Chart]].{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=143}} In addition to the title track, the album includes other early favourites such as "[[Running Free]]", "Transylvania", "[[Phantom of the Opera (song)|Phantom of the Opera]]", and "[[Sanctuary (Iron Maiden song)|Sanctuary]]" <U+2013> which was not on the original UK release but made the U.S. version and subsequent remasters. The band set out on a [[Iron Maiden Tour|headline tour of the UK]], before opening for [[Kiss (band)|Kiss]] on their 1980 [[Unmasked Tour]]'s European leg as well as supporting [[Judas Priest]] on [[British Steel Tour|select dates]]. After the Kiss tour, [[Dennis Stratton]] was dismissed from the band as a result of creative and personal differences,<ref>{{cite web|last = Hinchcliffe|first = Jon|title = Dennis Stratton Interview: October 1999|date = 27 October 1999|url = http://www.praying-mantis.com/mantis/dennis99.shtml|publisher=Praying-Mantis.com|accessdate =08-10-2006}}</ref> and was replaced by [[Adrian Smith]] in October 1980.

In 1981, Iron Maiden released their second album, entitled ''[[Killers (Iron Maiden album)|Killers]]''. Containing many tracks that had been written prior to their debut release, only two new songs were written for the record: "Prodigal Son" and "Murders in the Rue Morgue"{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=183}} (the latter of which's title was taken from the [[The Murders in the Rue Morgue|short story]] by [[Edgar Allan Poe]]).<ref> {{cite journal | title = Hack Job? | journal = Kerrang! Legends | first = Paul | last = Brannigan  | issue = 2 | pages = 26<U+2013>27}}</ref> Unsatisfied with the production on their debut album,{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=145}} the band hired veteran producer [[Martin Birch]],{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=181}} who would go on to work for Iron Maiden until his retirement in 1992.{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=300}} The record was followed by the band's first [[Killer World Tour|world tour]], which included their debut performance in the United States, opening for Judas Priest at [[Planet Hollywood Resort and Casino|The Aladdin Casino]], Las Vegas.{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=251}}

===Success (1981<U+2013>1986)===
By 1981, [[Paul Di'Anno]] was demonstrating increasingly self-destructive behaviour, particularly through his drug usage,<ref name="earlydaysdvd"/> about which Di'Anno comments, "it wasn't just that I was snorting a bit of coke, though; I was just going for it non-stop, 24 hours a day, every day... the band had commitments piling up that went on for months, years, and I just couldn't see my way to the end of it. I knew I'd never last the whole tour. It was too much."{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=194}} With his performances suffering, Di'Anno was immediately dismissed following the Killer World Tour,{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=219}} at which point the band had already selected his replacement.{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=218}}

After a meeting with Rod Smallwood at the Reading Festival,{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=217}} [[Bruce Dickinson]], previously of [[Samson (band)|Samson]], auditioned for Iron Maiden in September 1981 and was immediately hired.{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=218}}
The following month, Dickinson went out on the road with the band on a small headlining tour in Italy, as well as a one-off show at the [[Rainbow Theatre]] in the UK.{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=219}} In anticipation of their forthcoming album, the band played "Children of the Damned", "[[Run to the Hills]]", "22 Acacia Avenue" and "The Prisoner" at select venues, introducing fans to the sound that they were progressing towards.

Dickinson's record debut with Iron Maiden was 1982's ''[[The Number of the Beast (album)|The Number of the Beast]]'', an album that gave the band their first ever UK Albums Chart No.&nbsp;1 record{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=227}} and additionally became a Top Ten hit in many other countries.{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=228}}
Dickinson, at the time, was in the midst of legal difficulties with Samson's management and was not permitted to add his name to any of the songwriting credits, although he still made what he described as a "moral contribution" to "Children of the Damned", "The Prisoner" and "Run to the Hills".<ref>{{cite book | last1 = Shooman | first1 = Joe | title = Bruce Dickinson: Flashing Metal with Iron Maiden and Flying Solo | publisher = Independent Music Press | year = 2007 | page = 82 | isbn = 0-9552822-4-1}}</ref>
For the second time the band went on [[The Beast on the Road|a world tour]], visiting the United States, Canada, Japan, Australia, UK and Germany, including a headline appearance at the Reading Rock festival. A new and hugely successful chapter in Iron Maiden's future was cemented; the album went on to sell over 14 million copies worldwide.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/06/business/media/06maiden.html?_r=1 |title=Die-Hard Fans Follow Iron Maiden Into the Digital Age |work=The New York Times |date=5 September 2010 |accessdate=13-01-2011}}</ref>
[[File:Nicko McBrain 2.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Nicko McBrain]] has been Iron Maiden's drummer since 1982]]

The Number of the Beast tour's U.S. leg proved controversial when an American conservative political lobbying group claimed Iron Maiden were [[Satanism|Satanic]] because of the new album's title track,{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=228}} to the point where a group of Christian [[activism|activists]] destroyed Iron Maiden records as a protest against the band.<ref name="Kerrang! Legends32"/> In recent years, Dickinson has stated that the band treated this as "silliness,"<ref name="NOTBDVD">{{cite video|date= 4 December 2001|title=Classic Albums: The Number of the Beast|medium=DVD|publisher=Eagle Vision}}</ref> and that the demonstrations in fact gave them "loads of publicity."<ref name="earlydaysdvd"/>

In December 1982, drummer [[Clive Burr]] ended his association with the band due to personal and tour schedule problems and was replaced by [[Nicko McBrain]], previously of French band [[Trust (band)|Trust]].{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=233}} Soon afterwards, the band journeyed for the first time to [[The Bahamas]] to record the first of three consecutive albums at [[Compass Point Studios]].{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=246}} In 1983, they released ''[[Piece of Mind]]'', which reached the No.&nbsp;3 spot in the UK,{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=247}} and was the band's debut at the North American charts, reaching No.&nbsp;70 on the [[Billboard 200]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/charts/billboard-200#/album/iron-maiden/piece-of-mind/9073|title=Piece of Mind|work=Billboard|publisher=Nielsen Business Media, Inc.|accessdate=01-08-2009}}</ref> ''Piece of Mind'' includes the successful singles "[[The Trooper]]" and "[[Flight of Icarus]]," the latter of which being particularly notable as one of the band's few songs to gain substantial airplay in the U.S.{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=245}}

Soon after the success of ''Piece of Mind'' and its [[World Piece Tour|supporting tour]], the band released ''[[Powerslave (album)|Powerslave]]'' on 9 September 1984. The album featured fan favourites "[[2 Minutes to Midnight]]", "[[Aces High (song)|Aces High]]", and "Rime of The Ancient Mariner",{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=253}} the latter based on [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]]'s [[Rime of the Ancient Mariner|poem of the same name]] and running over 13 minutes long.

The tour following the album, dubbed the [[World Slavery Tour]], was the band's largest to date and consisted of 193 shows in 28 countries over 13 months,{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=253}} playing to an estimated 3,500,000 people.<ref name="Stenning102">{{cite book| author=Stenning, Paul| title=Iron Maiden: 30 Years of the Beast <U+2013> The Complete Unauthorised Biography| publisher=Chrome Dreams| year=2006| isbn=1-84240-361-3|page= 102}}</ref> Many shows were played back-to-back in the same city, such as in [[Long Beach, California]] (4 consecutive sold out concerts to an overall audience of 54,000), where the majority of their subsequent live release, ''[[Live After Death]]'', was recorded, which became a critical and commercial success, peaking at No.&nbsp;4 in the UK.{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=257}} Iron Maiden also co-headlined (with [[Queen (band)|Queen]]) the [[Rock In Rio]] festival, where they performed to an estimated crowd of 350,000.<ref>{{cite video|date= 4 February 2008|title=Live After Death: The History of Iron Maiden part 2|medium=DVD|publisher=EMI}}</ref> The tour was physically gruelling for the band, who demanded a six month break when it ended (although this was later reduced to four months).{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=258}} This was the first substantial break in the band's history, including the cancellation of a proposed supporting tour for the new live album,<ref name="Stenning104">{{cite book| author=Stenning, Paul| title=Iron Maiden: 30 Years of the Beast <U+2013> The Complete Unauthorised Biography| publisher=Chrome Dreams| year=2006| isbn=1-84240-361-3|page= 104}}</ref> with Bruce Dickinson threatening to quit unless the tour ended.{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=255}}

===Experimentation (1986<U+2013>1989)===
Returning from their time off, the band adopted a different style for their 1986 studio album, entitled ''[[Somewhere in Time (Iron Maiden album)|Somewhere in Time]]'', featuring, for the first time in the band's history, [[synthesiser|synthesised]] bass and guitars to add textures and layers to the sound.<ref name="amg_somewhereintime">{{cite web|url={{Allmusic|class=album|id=r9916|pure_url=yes}}|title=Somewhere in Time <U+2013> Review|accessdate=12-10-2008|author=Steve Huey|publisher=allmusic|year=2008}}</ref> The release charted well across the world, particularly with the single "[[Wasted Years]]," but notably included no writing credits from lead singer [[Bruce Dickinson]], whose material was rejected by the rest of the band.{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=260}}

The experimentation evident on ''Somewhere in Time'' continued on their next album, entitled ''[[Seventh Son of a Seventh Son]]'', which was released in 1988. A [[concept album]], based on ''[[The Tales of Alvin Maker]]'' series of novels by [[Orson Scott Card]],<ref> {{cite journal | title = Commercial Break! | journal = Metal Hammer presents: Iron Maiden 30 Years of Metal Mayhem | year = 2005 | first = Martin | last = Popoff | pages = 108<U+2013>109| id = | accessdate = 23-10-2011}}</ref> this would be the band's first record to include keyboards, as opposed to guitar synthesisers on the previous release.{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=265}} After his contributions were not used for ''Somewhere in Time'', Dickinson's enthusiasm was renewed as his ideas were accepted for this album.{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=265}} Another popular release, it became Iron Maiden's second album to hit No.&nbsp;1 in the UK charts,{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=263}} although it only achieved a Gold certification in the U.S, in contrast to its four predecessors.<ref name="RIAA">{{cite web| url=http://riaa.com/goldandplatinumdata.php?|title=RIAA Searchable database <U+2013> Gold and Platinum |publisher=Recording Industry Association of America |accessdate=30-03-2008}}</ref> 

During the following [[7th Tour of a 7th Tour|tour]], the band headlined the [[Monsters of Rock]] festival at [[Donington Park]] for the first time on 20 August 1988, playing to the largest crowd in the festival's history (107,000).{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=269}} Also included on the bill were [[Kiss (band)|Kiss]], [[David Lee Roth]], [[Megadeth]], [[Guns N' Roses]] and [[Helloween]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ukrockfestivals.com/donington-1988.html|title=Donington <U+2013> Iron Maiden|accessdate=12-10-2009|work=Donington 1988}}</ref> The festival was marred, however, by the deaths of two fans in a crowd-surge during the aforementioned Guns N' Roses performance; the following year's festival was cancelled as a result.{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=269}} The tour concluded with several headline shows in the UK in November and December 1988, with the concerts at the [[National Exhibition Centre|NEC Arena]], [[Birmingham]] recorded for a live video, entitled ''[[Maiden England]]''.{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=272}}

===Upheaval (1989<U+2013>1994)===
During another break in 1989, guitarist Adrian Smith released a solo album with his band [[ASAP (band)|ASAP]], entitled ''[[Silver and Gold (ASAP album)|Silver and Gold]]'',{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=273}} and vocalist Bruce Dickinson began work on a solo album with former [[Gillan]] guitarist [[Janick Gers]], releasing ''[[Tattooed Millionaire]]'' in 1990,{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=281}} followed by a tour.{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=285}} At the same time, to mark the band's ten year recording anniversary, Iron Maiden released ''[[The First Ten Years]]'', a series of ten CDs and double [[12"|12" vinyls]]. Between 24 February and 28 April 1990, the individual parts were released one-by-one, each containing two of Iron Maiden's singles, including the original B-sides.

Soon afterwards, Iron Maiden regrouped to work on a new studio record. During the pre-production stages, Adrian Smith left the band due to differences with Steve Harris regarding the direction the band should be taking, disagreeing with the "stripped down" style that they were leaning towards.{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=283}} Janick Gers, having worked on Dickinson's solo project, was chosen to replace Smith and became the band's first new member in seven years.{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=285}} The album, ''[[No Prayer for the Dying]]'', was released in October 1990<ref>{{cite web|url={{Allmusic|class=album|id=r9919|pure_url=yes}}|title=No Prayer for the Dying <U+2013> Review|accessdate=19-11-2011|author=Greg Prato|publisher=allmusic}}</ref> and contained "[[Bring Your Daughter... to the Slaughter]]", the band's first (and to date, only) [[UK Singles Chart]] No.&nbsp;1, originally recorded by Dickinson for the soundtrack to ''[[A Nightmare on Elm Street 5: The Dream Child]]''.{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=282}}

After another [[No Prayer on the Road|tour]] and some more time off, the band recorded their next album, ''[[Fear of the Dark (Iron Maiden album)|Fear of the Dark]]''. Released in 1992, the release was noticeably longer (due to this being Iron Maiden's first album recorded for CD rather than LP) and included the stand-out [[Fear of the Dark (song)|title track]], which is now a regular fixture in the band's concert setlists. Achieving their third No.&nbsp;1 in the UK albums chart,{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=289}} the disc also featured "[[Wasting Love]]", one of the band's softer songs, and the No.&nbsp;2 single "[[Be Quick or Be Dead]]". The album featured the first songwriting by Gers, and no collaboration at all between Harris and Dickinson on songs. The [[Fear of the Dark Tour|extensive worldwide tour that followed]] included their first ever Latin American leg (after a single concert during the World Slavery Tour), and being the headline act of "[[Monsters of Rock]] Festivals" in seven European countries. Iron Maiden's second performance at [[Donington Park]], to an audience of 68,500 (the attendance was capped after the incident in 1988),{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=291}} was filmed for the audio and video release, ''[[Live at Donington (Iron Maiden album)|Live at Donington]]'',<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0352442/|title=Live At The Donington|accessdate=14-10-2009|publisher=IMBD|year=2008}}</ref> and featured a surprise appearance by Adrian Smith, who joined the band to perform "Running Free".{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=291}}

In 1993, Bruce Dickinson left the band to further pursue his solo career, but agreed to remain for a [[Real Live Tour|farewell tour]] and two live albums (later re-released in [[A Real Live Dead One|one package]]).{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=293}} The first, ''[[A Real Live One]]'', featured songs from 1986 to 1992, and was released in March 1993. The second, ''[[A Real Dead One]]'', featured songs from 1980 to 1984, and was released after Dickinson had left the band. The tour did not go well, however, with Steve Harris claiming that Dickinson would only perform properly for high profile shows and that at several concerts he would only mumble into the microphone.{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=296}} Dickinson denies the charge that he was under-performing, stating that it was impossible to "make like Mr Happy Face if the vibe wasn't right," claiming that news of his exit from the band had prevented any chance of a good atmosphere during the tour.{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=297}} He played his farewell show with Iron Maiden on 28 August 1993, which was filmed, broadcast by the [[BBC]] and released on video under the name ''[[Raising Hell (video)|Raising Hell]]''.{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=298}}

In 1994, the band listened to hundreds of tapes sent in by vocalists before convincing [[Blaze Bayley]], formerly of the band [[Wolfsbane (band)|Wolfsbane]] who had supported Iron Maiden in 1990, to audition for them.{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=301}} Bayley had a different vocal style from his predecessor, which ultimately received a mixed reception among fans.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.roughedge.com/cdreviews/i/ironmaiden.htm#bravetbj|title=Iron Maiden CD reviews|accessdate=12-10-2008|work=Rough Edge Reviews}}</ref>

After a two year hiatus (as well as a three year hiatus from studio releases <U+2013> a record for the band at the time) Iron Maiden returned in 1995. Releasing ''[[The X Factor (album)|The X Factor]]'', the band had their lowest chart position since 1981 for an album in the UK (debuting at No.&nbsp;8),{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=313}} although it would go on to win ''Album of the Year'' awards in France and Germany.{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=311}}
The record included the 11-minute epic "Sign of the Cross", the band's longest song since "Rime of the Ancient Mariner", as well as the singles, "[[Man on the Edge]]", based on the film ''[[Falling Down]]'',<ref> {{cite book | last1 = Paterson | first1 = Lawrence | title = Blaze Bayley: At the End of the Day | publisher = Blaze Bayley Recordings Ltd | year = 2009 | page = 44}}</ref> and "[[Lord of the Flies (song)|Lord of the Flies]]", based on the [[Lord of the Flies|novel of the same name]].<ref>{{cite journal | title = The X Offender | journal = Metal Hammer presents: Iron Maiden 30 Years of Metal Mayhem | year = 2005 | first = Martin | last = Popoff | page = 63| id = | accessdate = 21-09-2011}}</ref> The release is notable for its "dark" tone, inspired by Steve Harris' divorce.{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=311}} [[The X Factour|The band toured]] for the rest of 1995 and 1996, playing for the first time in [[Israel]] and South Africa,{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=314}} before stopping to release ''[[Best of the Beast]]''. The band's first compilation, it included a new single, "[[Virus (Iron Maiden song)|Virus]]", whose lyrics attack the critics who had recently written off the band.{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=316}}

Iron Maiden returned to the studio to record ''[[Virtual XI]]'', released in 1998. The album's chart scores were the band's lowest to date, including the UK where it peaked at No.&nbsp;16<ref> {{cite web | url = http://www.theofficialcharts.com/archive-chart/_/3/1998-04-04/ | title = Official UK Albums Archive 4 April 1998 | accessdate = 17-10-2011}}</ref> failing to score one million worldwide sales for the first time in Iron Maiden's history. At the same time, Steve Harris assisted in remastering the band's entire discography, up to and including ''Live at Donington'' (which was given a mainstream release for the first time).

[[File:Iron Maiden en Costa Rica.jpg|thumb|270px|right|Adrian Smith re-joined Iron Maiden in 1999, causing the band to have a three guitar line-up.]]

Following problems with his voice during the [[Virtual XI World Tour]],{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=321}} a band meeting was held in January 1999, in which Bayley was asked to leave Iron Maiden.{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=324}} At the same time, the band were in talks with former vocalist, Bruce Dickinson, who agreed to rejoin during a meeting in Brighton,{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=329}} along with guitarist Adrian Smith, who was telephoned a few hours later.{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=330}} With Janick Gers, Smith's replacement, remaining, Iron Maiden now had a three guitar line-up and embarked on a hugely successful reunion tour.{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=331}} Dubbed "[[The Ed Hunter Tour]]," it tied in with the band's newly released greatest hits collection, ''[[Ed Hunter]]'', which also contained a computer game of the same name starring [[Eddie the Head|the band's mascot]].

In November 1999, the band moved to Guillaume Tell Studios, Paris with producer [[Kevin Shirley]] to make their first studio release following the reunion with Dickinson and Smith, 2000's ''[[Brave New World (Iron Maiden album)|Brave New World]]''.{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=341}} Thematic influences continued with "[[The Wicker Man (song)|The Wicker Man]]" <U+2013> based on the 1973 British [[The Wicker Man (1973 film)|cult film of the same name]] <U+2013> and "Brave New World" <U+2013> title taken from the [[Aldous Huxley]] [[Brave New World|novel of the same name]].{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=342}} The album furthered the more progressive and melodic sound present in some earlier recordings, with elaborate song structures and keyboard orchestration.{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=342}}

[[Brave New World Tour|The world tour]] that followed consisted of well over 100&nbsp;dates and culminated on 19 January 2001 in a show at the [[Rock in Rio]] festival in Brazil, where Iron Maiden played to an audience of around 250,000.{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=353}}<ref> {{cite book | last1 = Shooman | first1 = Joe | title = Bruce Dickinson: Flashing Metal with Iron Maiden and Flying Solo | publisher = Independent Music Press | year = 2007 | page = 176 | accessdate = 03-09-2011| quote = the crowd of 250,000 was treated to a set full of old and new classics | isbn = 0-9552822-4-1}}</ref><ref>{{cite video|date= 10 June 2002|title=Iron Maiden: Rock in Rio|medium=DVD|publisher=Sanctuary}}</ref><ref> {{cite web | url = http://www.metal-rules.com/concerts/RockInRioIII.htm | title = Rock in Rio III Concert review | accessdate = 04-09-2011 | date = 2002-04-05 | publisher = Meta-rules.com | quote = From the supposed attendance of 250,000 people...}}</ref> While the performance was being produced for a CD and DVD release in March 2002, under the name ''[[Rock in Rio (album)|Rock in Rio]]'',{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=357}} the band took a year out from touring, during which they played three consecutive shows at [[Brixton Academy]] in aid of former drummer [[Clive Burr]], who had recently announced that he had been diagnosed with [[multiple sclerosis]].{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=361}}

Following their [[Give Me Ed... 'Til I'm Dead Tour]] in the summer of 2003, Iron Maiden released ''[[Dance of Death (album)|Dance of Death]]'', their thirteenth studio album, which was met by worldwide critical and commercial success.{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=368}} Produced by Kevin Shirley, now the band's regular producer, many critics also felt that this release matched up to their earlier efforts, such as ''Killers'', ''Piece of Mind'' and ''The Number of the Beast''.{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=369}} As usual, historical and literary references were present, with "Monts<U+00E9>gur" in particular being about the [[Catharism|Cathar]] stronghold conquered in 1244,{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=373}} and "Paschendale" relating to [[Battle of Passchendaele|the significant battle]] which took place during [[World War I|The First World War]].{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=375}}

===Claims of Satanic references===
In 1982, the band released one of their most popular, controversial and acclaimed albums, ''[[The Number of the Beast (album)|The Number of the Beast]]''. The artwork and title track led to Christian groups in the United States branding the band as [[Satanism|Satanists]], encouraging people to destroy copies of the release.<ref name="Kerrang! Legends32"> {{cite journal | title = Raising Hell | journal = Kerrang! Legends | first = Simon | last = Young | issue = 2| page = 32| accessdate = 20-09-2011}}</ref> The band's manager, Rod Smallwood, later commented that Christians initially burnt the records, but later decided to destroy them with hammers through fear of breathing in the melting vinyl's fumes.<ref name="NOTBDVD"/><ref name="Kerrang! Legends32"/> The claims were not restricted to the United States, however, with the Catholic Church managing to prevent Iron Maiden from performing in Chile in 1992.<ref> {{cite web | url = http://www.bravewords.com/news/163787 | title = Chilean Magazine Slams IRON MAIDEN Why Music Matters Animated Film As "Full Of Lies" | accessdate = 20-09-2011}}</ref>

They just wanted to believe all that rubbish about us being Satanists."{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=228}} Harris has also stated that "[[The Number of the Beast (song)|The Number of the Beast]]" was inspired by a nightmare he had after watching [[Damien: Omen II]],{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=224}} and also influenced by [[Robert Burns]]' ''[[Tam o' Shanter (Burns poem)|Tam o' Shanter]]''.<ref name="NOTBDVD"/> Furthermore the band's drummer, [[Nicko McBrain]], has been a born again Christian since 1999.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.godscare.net/witness/Iron%20Maiden.htm |title=The drummer with million |publisher=Godscare.net |accessdate=27-08-2010}}</ref>

The band's guitarists, Dave Murray, Adrian Smith and Janick Gers, each have their own individual influences and playing style. Dave Murray is known for his [[legato]] technique which, he claims, "evolved naturally.

Throughout their career, the band's style has remained largely unchanged, in spite of the addition of guitar synthesizers on 1986's ''Somewhere in Time'',<ref name="amg_somewhereintime"/> keyboards on 1988's ''Seventh Son of a Seventh Son'',{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=265}} and an attempt to return to the "stripped down" production of their earlier material on 1990's ''No Prayer for the Dying''.{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=283}} In recent years, however, the band have begun using more [[progressive rock|progressive]] elements in their songs,<ref> {{cite journal | title = The Good Life | journal = Classic Rock | date = 2006-09-01 | first = Malcolm | last = Dome | issue = 97 | page = 76| id = | accessdate = 21-09-2011}}</ref><ref name="war all the time">{{cite journal | title = Iron Maiden: War all the Time | journal = Metal Hammer | date = 2006-09-01 | first = Malcolm | last = Dome | issue = 157 | pages = 34<U+2013>40 }}</ref> which Steve Harris describes as not progressive "in the modern sense, but like [[Dream Theater]], more in a 70s way."<ref name="war all the time"/> According to Harris, ''Seventh Son of a Seventh Son'' was the band's first album which was "more progressive,"{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=264}} while they would only return to this style from 1995's ''The X Factor'', which he states is "like an extension of ''Seventh Son''..., in the sense of the progressive element to it."{{sfn|Wall|2004|p=311}} The development contrasts with the band's earlier material, which [[Allmusic]] states was "clearly drawing from elements of punk rock,"<ref>{{cite web|url={{Allmusic|class=album|id=r9908|pure_url=yes}}|title=Iron Maiden <U+2013> Review|accessdate=19-11-2011|author=Steve Huey|publisher=allmusic}}</ref> and also led to drummer Nicko McBrain stating in 2006, "I don't regard Iron Maiden as heavy metal.

==Special charter==
[[Image:Ed-Force one 757.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Iron Maiden's jet, an Astraeus [[Boeing 757-200]], in its 2008 livery]]
In October 2007, Iron Maiden commissioned an [[Astraeus (airline)|Astraeus]] 757 as transport for their '[[Somewhere Back in Time World Tour]]' in 2008.<ref name=plane/> Lead singer Bruce Dickinson explained the logic behind the charter in 2007:<ref name=plane> {{cite web | url = http://www.metalstorm.net/events/news_comments.php?news_id=5589&print_page=yes | title = Iron Maiden - More Somewhere Back In Time World Tour Dates | accessdate = 20-11-2011}}</ref> ''<blockquote>"Looking at the list of places we would like to play we have always had problems joining up the dots. With sea containers in various places it slows down the whole touring process, which is fine if you want a holiday but not if you want to play. It's great to see places but we don't want to sit around for a week waiting for gear to get from, say, Australia to South America, so this way we can get to more fans in more places en route in the same time period"''</blockquote>'' 
[[File:Iron Maiden's Ed Force One at Keflav<U+00ED>k airport in Iceland.jpg|thumb|250px|"Ed Force One" in its 2011 decals]]

The aircraft, named "Ed Force One" after a competition on the band's website,<ref> {{cite web | url = http://www.undercover.fm/news/3803-iron-maiden-reveal-ed-force-one | title = Iron Maiden Reveal Ed Force One | accessdate = 20-11-2011}}</ref> was flown by Dickinson as he is also a commercial airline pilot for Astraeus. The aeroplane was converted into a [[combi]] configuration and repainted with a special Iron Maiden livery, along with a list of that year's tour dates.<ref name=plane/> According to Dickinson, Astraeus decided to retain the Iron Maiden artwork when it returned to normal charter service after receiving positive feedback from customers, but had to remove the decals after passengers in Africa refused to board the plane, claiming it to be possessed by evil spirits.<ref name=livery>{{cite web | url = http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=100396 | title = Iron Maiden Frontman Issues 'Bruce Air' Update | accessdate = 20-11-2011}}</ref>

The decoration was restored a year later as the same aircraft (G-OJIB) was used on the final leg of the Somewhere Back in Time tour in 2009.<ref name="SBITfinalleg"/> It plays a major role in the award-winning documentary,<ref name="Juno"/><ref name="SXSW"/> ''[[Iron Maiden: Flight 666]]'', which was released in cinemas in 42 countries in April 2009<ref name="666 cinema" /> and on DVD and Blu-ray in May and June 2009.<ref name="666 Blu" /> The film debuted on British television on 4 March 2010 at 11:00&nbsp;pm on BBC4 as part of Heavy Metal Britannia Weekend.<ref> {{cite web | url = http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=135801 | title = Iron Maiden 'Flight 666' To Be Screened As Part Of BBC4's 'Heavy Metal Britannia' Weekend | accessdate = 20-11-2011}}</ref>

"Ed Force One" was used again for "[[The Final Frontier World Tour]]" in 2011, although this time with a different aeroplane (G-STRX) and altered livery, adopting the artwork of "[[The Final Frontier]]".<ref name="FF 28 quote"/>
