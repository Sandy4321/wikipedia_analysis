The '''Blue Iguana''' or '''Grand Cayman Iguana''' ('''''Cyclura lewisi''''') is a [[critically endangered species]] of [[lizard]] of the genus ''[[Cyclura]]'' endemic to the island of [[Grand Cayman]]. Previously listed as a subspecies of the [[Cyclura nubila|Cuban Iguana]], it was reclassified as a separate species in 2004 because of genetic differences discovered four years earlier. The Blue Iguana is one of the longest-living species of lizard (possibly up to 69&nbsp;years). The record is 67 years.

The Blue Iguana prefers dwelling in rocky, sunlit, open areas in [[dry forest]]s or near the shore, as the females must dig holes in the sand to lay eggs in June and July.  A possible second clutch is laid in September. The Blue Iguana's [[herbivory|vegetarian]] diet includes plants, fruits, and flowers. Its coloration is tan to gray with a bluish cast that is more pronounced during the breeding season and more so in males. It is large and heavy-bodied with a dorsal crest of short spines running from the base of the neck to the end of the tail.

The fossil record indicates that the Blue Iguana was abundant before [[European colonization]]; but fewer than 15&nbsp;animals remained in the wild by 2003, and this wild population was predicted to become [[extinct]] within the first decade of the 21st century. The species' decline is mainly being driven by [[predation]] by feral pets (cats and dogs) and indirectly by the destruction of their natural [[habitat (ecology)|habitat]] as fruit farms are converted to pasture for cattle grazing. Since 2004, hundreds of captive-bred animals have been released into a preserve on Grand Cayman run by a partnership headed by the [[Durrell Wildlife Conservation Trust]], in an attempt to save the species. At least five non-profit organizations are working with the government of the Cayman Islands to ensure the survival of the Blue Iguana.

At the same time, they have [[cone cell|cells]] called "[[double cone]]s" which give them sharp color vision and enable them to see [[ultraviolet]] wavelengths.<ref name="Brames"/> This ability is useful when basking so the animal can ensure that it absorbs enough sunlight in the forms of UVA and UVB to produce [[Vitamin D]].<ref name="devosjoli"/>

Blue Iguanas have evolved a white photosensory organ on the top of their heads called the [[parietal eye]] (also known as the third eye, pineal eye or pineal gland).<ref name="Brames"/> This "eye" does not work the same way as a normal eye as it has only a rudimentary retina and lens and thus, cannot form images.<ref name="Brames"/> It is however sensitive to changes in light and dark and can detect movement.<ref name="Brames"/>

==Distribution and habitat==
[[File:Cayman Islands (detail).jpg|thumb|300px|The Blue Iguana lives on [[Grand Cayman]], the largest and westernmost of the [[Cayman Islands]] southwest of [[Cuba]].]]
The Blue Iguana is found only on the island of [[Grand Cayman]]. Comparison with other ''Cyclura'' species in the region strongly suggests that there was once a coastal population of Blue Iguanas which was gradually displaced or extirpated by human settlements and the construction of roads.<ref name="iucn"/> The Blue Iguana now only occurs inland in natural [[xerophytic]] shrubland and along the interfaces between farm clearings, roads, and gardens and closed-canopy dry forest or shrubland.<ref name="iucn"/><ref name="plan"/> The interior population is believed to have been attracted to agricultural clearings and fruit farms which provide thermoregulatory opportunities, herbaceous browse, fallen fruit, and nesting soil, but this also brought the Blue Iguana into contact with humans and feral animals.<ref name="iucn"/> Females often migrate to coastal areas to nest.<ref name="salina">

Like all ''Cyclura'' species, the Blue Iguana is primarily [[herbivory|herbivorous]], consuming leaves, flowers, and fruits from over 45&nbsp;species of plant.<ref name="iucn"/><ref name="plan"/> This diet is very rarely supplemented with insect larvae, crabs, slugs, dead birds, and fungi.<ref name="herp"/><ref name="plan"/> The iguanas are presented with a special problem for [[osmoregulation]]: plant matter contains more [[potassium]] and as it has less nutritional content per gram, more must be eaten to meet the lizard's metabolic needs.<ref name="Hazard">{{cite book | last = Hazard | first = Lisa C. | title = Sodium and Potassium Secretion by Iguana Salt Glands | work = Iguanas: Biology and Conservation | publisher = University of California Press | pages = 84<U+2013>85 | year = 2004 | isbn = 978-0-520-23854-1 }}

Blue Iguanas used to regularly be sold to tourists as pets, as their rarity made them appealing to exotic-animal collectors, despite this being illegal under the [[CITES]] treaty.<ref name="pet"/> In 1999 a [[World Wildlife Fund]] international conservation officer, Stuart Chapman, said, "The British government has turned a blind eye for over 20&nbsp;years to these overseas territories which are home to many rare and endangered species. Many of these face extinction if Britain fails to honour its treaty obligations. The British Caribbean islands are extremely rich in biodiversity with many critically [[endangered species]] that are unique to the islands<U+2014>yet there is virtually zero enforcement or implementation of CITES."<ref name="pet">

In May 2008, six Blue Iguanas were found dead in the preserve within Queen Elizabeth II Botanic Park on Grand Cayman.<ref name="killing"/> The iguanas were apparently killed by human vandals armed with knives and two of the slaughtered animals were gravid females about to lay eggs.<ref name="killing">{{cite news | last = Kenyon | first = Georgina | title = Probe into giant iguana slaughter | publisher = BBC | date = 2008-05-07 | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/7388256.stm | accessdate = 2008-05-11 }}</ref>

The wild population of Blue Iguanas had been reduced from a near island-wide distribution to a non-viable, fragmented remnant.<ref name="Burton"/><ref name="wildblue"/> By 2001, no young hatched in the unmanaged wild population were surviving to breeding age, meaning the population was functionally extinct, with only five animals remaining in the wild.<ref name="Burton"/>

===Recovery efforts===
In 1990 the [[American Zoo and Aquarium Association]] (AZA) designated the genus ''Cyclura'' as their highest priority for conservation.<ref name="zoorole">{{cite book | last = Hudson | first = Richard D. | last2 = Alberts | first2 = Allison C. | title = The Role of Zoos in the Conservation of West Indian Iguanas | work = Iguanas: Biology and Conservation | publisher = University of California Press | pages = 274<U+2013>289 | year = 2004 | isbn = 978-0-520-23854-1 }}
</ref> Their first project was an ''[[in situ]]'' captive breeding program for the Blue Iguana, which at the time was the most critically endangered of all the species of ''Cyclura''.<ref name="zoorole"/>

One of the early difficulties encountered was that the captive stock of the early 1990s was found not to be pure.<ref name="herp"/><ref name="zoorole"/> It was discovered through DNA analysis that the captive population contained a number of animals that were [[Hybrid (biology)|hybrids]] with ''C. nubila caymanensis''.<ref name="herp"/><ref name="zoorole"/> The program contains only pure specimens, as these hybrids were sterilized by means of hemipenectomies and hence excluded.<ref name="Dorge"/><ref name="plan"/><ref name="zoorole"/> This program was created to determine the exact genealogies of the limited gene pool of the remaining animals and DNA analysis revealed that the entire North American captive population was descended from a single pair of animals.<ref name="zoorole"/> After five years of research two captive breeding populations were established and are managed as a single unit, with cross-breeding between the populations to promote genetic diversity.<ref name="zoorole"/>

As a hedge against disaster striking the Blue Iguana population on Grand Cayman, an [[ex situ|off-island]] captive population was established in 25&nbsp;zoos in the USA.<ref name="plan"/><ref name="zoorole"/> A minimum of 20&nbsp;founder lines represented by at least 225&nbsp;individuals is being maintained by captive breeding and recorded in a [[studbook]] for the species by Tandora Grant of the [[San Diego Zoo]]'s Center for Conservation and Research for Endangered Species (CRES).<ref name="plan"/><ref name="BIRP0606"/><ref name="zoorole"/> The [[Indianapolis Zoo]] has had success with breeding the Blue Iguana in captivity twice since the year 2000.<ref name="hatch">{{cite web | title = Iguanas Hatch in Indianapolis | work = Significant Efforts in Conservation | publisher = Association of Zoos and Aquariums | year = 2002 | pages= 39 | url = http://www.aza.org/Publications/2002/06/June2002SigEfforts.pdf | format = PDF| accessdate = 2007-10-04 }}</ref>

In October 2006, hatchlings were released into the wild for the first time to boost the species and help bring them back from the brink of extinction.<ref name="independent">{{cite news | title = Hatchlings revive rarest lizard on earth | publisher = London Independent | date = 2006-10-06 | url = http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4158/is_20061026/ai_n16803494 | accessdate = 2008-03-15

The Blue Iguana is established in captivity, both in public and private collections.<ref name="devosjoli"/> As there are very few pure-bred animals in private collections, private individuals have established these animals in captive breeding programs as hybrids with the Lesser Caymans Iguana&nbsp;(''C.nubila caymanensis'') and occasional hybrids with the Cuban Iguana&nbsp;(''C.n.nubila'') minimizing the demand for wild-caught specimens for the pet trade.<ref name="devosjoli"/>

====Blue Iguana Recovery Programme====
[[File:Blue Iguana resting on bench QEII Botanic Park.jpg|thumb|Blue Iguana resting on park bench off Wilderness Trail at QE II Botanic Park]]The Blue Iguana Recovery Programme grew from a small project started within the National Trust for the Cayman Islands in 1990. It is now a partnership, linking the Trust with the Cayman Islands Department of Environment, National Trust Cayman Islands, Queen Elizabeth II Botanic Park, [[Durrell Wildlife Conservation Trust]], International Reptile Conservation Foundation, IRCF, and the [[European Commission]].<ref name="Burton"/> This program operates under a special exemption from provisions in the Animals Law of the Cayman Islands which normally would make it illegal for anyone to kill, capture, or keep iguanas.<ref name="plan"/><ref name="caymannetnews"/> BIRP's [[Wildlife conservation|conservation]] strategy involves generating large numbers of genetically diverse hatchlings, head-starting<ref name ="head">'''Head-starting''' means raising the animals in captivity from the time they hatch until they are big enough not to fall prey to feral cats and rodents, thereby offsetting the juvenile mortality rate.</ref> them for two years where their chance of survival in the wild is high, and using these animals to rebuild a series of wild sub-populations in protected, managed natural areas.<ref name="kenyon2"/><ref name="plan"/><ref name="knapp">
