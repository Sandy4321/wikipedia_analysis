The '''Norman Thompson N.T.4''' was a twin-engined [[United Kingdom|British]] [[flying boat]] of the [[World War I|First World War]].  Although less well known than similar Curtiss and Felixstowe flying boats, 50 were built for Britain's [[Royal Naval Air Service]].  
==Development and design==
The White and Thompson company was formed by Norman Thompson and Douglas White in 1912 at [[Bognor Regis]], [[Sussex]] to design and build aircraft.<ref name="Goodall p7-8"> Goodall 1995, pp. 7<U+2013>8.</ref>  It built several models of aircraft in small numbers, before being renamed the [[Norman Thompson Flight Company]] in September 1915.  

The first aircraft to be produced by the renamed company was a twin-engined patrol flying boat, the '''Norman Thompson N.T.4'''.  This was a three bay [[biplane]] powered by two [[Pusher configuration|pusher]] [[Hispano-Suiza 8|Hispano-Suiza]] engines mounted between the wings and was fitted with an enclosed, heavily glazed cockpit for its four man crew.  

An initial order for ten aircraft for the [[Royal Naval Air Service]] was placed in December 1915, with the first prototype flying in October 1916.<ref name="Goodall p44-5"> Goodall 1995, pp.44-45.</ref> Further orders were placed in 1917 bringing the total ordered to 50. Production continued through 1917, but in 1918, following a change in policy on anti-submarine aircraft, the final contract for 20 aircraft was cancelled.<ref name="Goodall p49"> Goodall 1995, p.49.</ref>  Total production was 26 aircraft, continuing until June 1918.<ref name="Goodall p49,53"> Goodall 1995, pp.49,53.</ref> 

Norman Thompson produced a revised design to meet the requirements of Admiralty Specification N.2C, to replace the N.T.4.  This type, designated the '''Norman Thompson N.2C''' used the wings of the N.T.4 but with a new hull resembling that of the Porte/Felixstowe boats. Power was by two 200&nbsp;hp (149&nbsp;kW) [[Sunbeam Arab]] engines.  The first prototype attempted to fly on 1 August 1918, but required changes to the hull before it was capable of take-off.  Water handling remained poor, and the aircraft was tail heavy in flight. It was abandoned following the end of the war.<ref name="London p39-40"> London 2003, pp.39<U+2014>40.</ref>

==Operational history==
The N.T.4 entered service with the RNAS in 1916,<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.english-heritage.org.uk/upload/pdf/aircraft_table.pdf|title=English Heritage Aircraft utilised by the RFC, RNAS, RAF and US Navy within the UK 1912-18|accessdate=2007-09-17 |format=PDF |work= }}</ref> being operated on anti-submarine patrols over the [[North Sea]] and [[English Channel]] but were mainly used for training, as larger aircraft were more suitable for patrol purposes.<ref name="Goodall p47"> Goodall 1995, p.47.</ref> Many of the aircraft produced in 1918 were delivered straight to storage  and were never used.<ref name="Goodall p49"> Goodall 1995, p.49.</ref>  Owing to its similarity in size to the [[Curtiss H.4]], it shared the Curtiss flying boat's nickname of "America", being renamed "Small America" when the larger [[Curtiss H12]] (known as "Large America") and [[Felixstowe F.2]] flying boats came into service.  <ref name="Thetford Naval">Thetford 1978, p.266-267 </ref>
