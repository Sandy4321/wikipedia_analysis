Oxford's coaches were R. E. Eason (who rowed for the Dark Blues in the [[The Boat Race 1924|1924 race]]), J. H. Page and D. T. Raikes (who represented Oxford in the [[The Boat Race 1920|1920]], [[The Boat Race 1921|1921]] and [[The Boat Race 1922|1922 races]]).  Cambridge were coached by F. E. Hellyer (who rowed for the Light Blues in the [[The Boat Race 1910|1910]] and [[The Boat Race 1911|1911 races]]), [[Kenneth Payne]] (who rowed for Cambridge in the [[The Boat Race 1932|1932]] and [[The Boat Race 1934|1934 races]]), [[Harold Rickett]] (a Light Blue three times between 1930 and 1932) and P. H. Thomas (a four-time Blue between 1902 and 1905).<ref>Burnell, pp. 110&ndash;111</ref>  The umpire for the race was former Cambridge rower [[Claude Taylor (rower)|Claude Taylor]] who had represented the Light Blues in the [[The Boat Race 1901|1901]], [[The Boat Race 1902|1902]] and [[The Boat Race 1903|1903 races]].<ref>Burnell, pp. 49, 67&ndash;68</ref>

The rowing correspondent for ''[[The Manchester Guardian]]'' anticipated a close race: "the prospects of Oxford and Cambridge for this year's University Boat-race on Saturday have now become much more even".<ref>{{Cite news | title = Close Boat-race expected | work = [[The Manchester Guardian]] | date = 25 March 1948 | page = 6 }}</ref>  His counterpart at ''[[The Times]]'' was in agreement: "it really seems that whichever crew gets off best in the first two minutes will probably win the race."<ref>{{Cite news | title = Prospects of a close race | date = 27 March 1948 | page = 4 | issue = 51030}}</ref>

==Race==

Cambridge won the [[coin flipping|toss]] and elected to start from the [[Middlesex]] station, handing the [[Surrey]] side of the river to Oxford.  The race was started at 3:30&nbsp;p.m. by umpire Taylor.<ref name=burn76/>  The Light Blues [[stroke rate|out-rated]] their opponents from the start but soon after their number six, [[Paul Bircher]] "[[Catch a crab|caught a crab]]", allowing Oxford to take a half-length lead which they extended to three-quarters of a length by Craven Steps.<ref name=allrecords>{{Cite news | title = Cambridge break all records | first = G. I. F. |last = Thomson | work = [[The Observer]] | page = 8 | date = 28 March 1948}}</ref>  Despite having stopped to allow Bircher to recover his oar, Cambridge drew level and were over a quarter of a length ahead by the time the crews passed the Mile Post, yet nine seconds off record pace and rowing into a head wind. Cambridge were a length ahead at [[Harrods Furniture Depository]] and drew clear as the boats passed below [[Hammersmith Bridge]].<ref name=recordtime/> 

As the crews passed the HMS ''Stork'' training ship, Cambridge began to draw away and were two lengths ahead by Chiswick Steps.<ref name=recordtime/>  With a strong tailwind along Corney Reach, the Light Blues continued to pull ahead and passed below [[Barnes Railway Bridge]] four lengths ahead, and six seconds ahead of the course record.  Cambridge passed the finishing post five lengths ahead in a time of 17 minutes 50 seconds.  The victory, Cambridge's second in a row, and third in the last four races, took the overall record in the race to 50&ndash;43 in their favour.<ref name=results/>  The special correspondent writing in ''[[The Observer]]'' called it "the maddest Boat Race for years".<ref name=cut>{{Cite news | title = Cambridge cut 13 seconds off race record | work = [[The Observer]] | date = 28 March 1948 | page = 1}}</ref>  ''The Times''{{'s}} rowing correspondent suggested it was "a great triumph for the Cambridge coaches, who so often seem able to produce something out of the bag which has not been apparent in practice."<ref name=recordtime>{{Cite news | title = Cambridge win in record time | work = [[The Times]] | date = 29 March 1948 | page = 6 | issue = 51031}}</ref>  Writing in ''The Manchester Guardian'', the rowing correspondent noted that it was "strange that Cambridge had never shown anything like this form in practice",<ref>{{Cite news | work = [[The Manchester Guardian]] | date = 29 March 1948 | title = Cambridge win in record time | page = 2}}</ref>
