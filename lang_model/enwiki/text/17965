==History==
[[File:BritishNorthBorneoCharteredCompany.png|thumb|left|[[Board of directors]] of [[North Borneo Chartered Company|BNBC]].]]
In the late 1800s, the [[North Borneo Chartered Company|British North Borneo Company]] (BNBC) began to establish colonies throughout [[North Borneo]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sta.my/sabah_history.cfm|title=History of Sabah|publisher=Sabah Tourism Association (STA)|date=|accessdate=2013-05-21}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.britishempire.co.uk/maproom/northborneo.htm|title=Brief History|work=The British Empire|publisher=britishempire.co.uk|date=|accessdate=2013-05-21}}</ref> In 1882, BNBC founded a small settlement in the area known as Gaya Bay, which was already inhabited by [[Bajau]] people.<ref name=kk2>{{cite news|url=http://www.bt.com.bn/golden-legacy/2011/01/10/history-kota-kinabalu|title=The History of Kota Kinabalu|publisher=[[The Brunei Times]]|date=10 January 2011|accessdate=21 May 2013}}</ref> The first settlement was on [[Pulau Gaya|Gaya Island]].<ref name=bk1>{{cite book|author1=Charles De Ledesma|author2=Mark Lewis|author3=Pauline Savage|title=Malaysia, Singapore & Brunei|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=hS0_GehsGPwC&pg=PA508|accessdate=22 May 2013|year=2003|publisher=Rough Guides|isbn=978-1-84353-094-7|pages=508<U+2013>}}</ref> In 1897, this first settlement was burned and destroyed by the indigenous Bajau freedom fighter [[Mat Salleh]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sejarahmalaysia.pnm.my/portalBI/detail.php?section=sm04&spesifik_id=312&ttl_id=49|title=Mat Salleh Fort|work=History of Malaysia|publisher=Perpustakaan Negara Malaysia (National Library of Malaysia)|accessdate=2007-04-08}}</ref>

After the war on the edge of bankruptcy, the British North Borneo Company returned to administer Jesselton but was unable to finance the huge costs of reconstruction. They gave control of North Borneo to the [[British overseas territory|British Crown]] on 15 July 1946.

When North Borneo together with [[Sarawak]], [[Singapore]] & the [[Federation of Malaya]] formed the [[Malaysia|Federation of Malaysia]] in 1963, it became known as Sabah, and Jesselton remained its capital.<ref name=kk2/> Jesselton was renamed as Kota Kinabalu on 30 September 1968 and received [[List of cities in Malaysia|official city status]] from the Malaysian government on February 2, 2000.<ref name=kk2/>

===Etymology===
[[File:Tanjung lipat.jpg|left|thumb|View of Likas Bay at dawn. On the far right is [[Mount Kinabalu]].]]
Kota Kinabalu is named after [[Mount Kinabalu]], which is situated about 50&nbsp;kilometres east-northeast of the city. ''Kinabalu'' is derived from the name ''Aki Nabalu'' meaning the "revered place of the dead." ''Aki'' means "ancestors" or "grandfather", and ''Nabalu'' is a name for the mountain in the [[Dusun]] language.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.virtualmalaysia.com/destination/mount%20kinabalu%2Fkinabalu%20park.html|title=Mount Kinabalu|publisher=Virtual Malaysia|accessdate=2007-04-02}}</ref> There is also a source claiming that the term originated from ''Ki Nabalu'', where ''Ki'' meaning "have" or "exist", and ''Nabalu'' meaning "spirit of the dead".<ref name="multiple">{{cite web|author=Sorudim, Lesaya|url=http://www.kdca.org.my/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=101&Itemid=112|title=KINABALU: Kina Balu , Aki Nabalu, or Ki Nabalu?|publisher=KDCA Publications|date=2005-05-02|accessdate=2008-01-15}}</ref>

''Kota'' is a Malay word for a "fort", "town", or a "city". It is also used formally in a few other Malaysian towns and cities, for example, [[Kota Bahru]], [[Kota Tinggi]], and [[Kota Kemuning]]. It can also be used informally to refer to any towns or cities. Hence, a direct translation of the name ''Kota Kinabalu'' into English would be "City of Kinabalu" or "Kinabalu City".

[[Wendy Law Suart]] wrote in her book on [[North Borneo]], ''The Lingering Eye'', "there is in the [[Sabah Museum|Sabah State Museum]] a Dutch map of Borneo and the Celebes dated 1657 in which the settlement where Jesselton was to stand is clearly labelled Api Api.  It may have some connection with the seaside tree with breathing roots that bears the same name."<ref>Wendy Law Suart (1993) ''The Lingering Eye'' page 55, footnote</ref><ref name=js1/> In Chinese, the city is known as 'Api', which is the [[Hakka]] pronunciation for <U+4E9A><U+5E87> (Simplified Chinese; Traditional Chinese: <U+4E9E><U+5E87>; Pinyin: ''y<U+00E0> b<U+00EC>'' ).

===Original names===
Besides Jesselton, there have been a number of other theories regarding the origins of the original name for Kota Kinabalu. The most popular, as mentioned above, is ''Api-Api'', or simply ''Api'', which is a Malay word meaning 'Fire'.<ref name=js1/> It was apparently named as such by the mainly Bajau locals to commemorate the burning of the British administrative office on Pulau Gaya (Gaya Island) instigated by Mat Salleh,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sabahtravelguide.com/features/|title=History of Sabah|publisher=Sabah Travel Guide|accessdate=2007-03-08}}</ref> as well as other incidents of arson normally perpetrated by pirates. There are claims, however, that Kota Kinabalu was actually named after a nearby river called ''Sungai Api-Api''. Besides Api-Api, another suggested historical name is ''Deasoka'', which roughly means "below the coconut tree" in the Bajau language.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.dbkk.sabah.gov.my/bm/content/static/view/339|title=NAMA ASAL|publisher=DBKK Official Website|date=|accessdate=19 May 2013}}</ref> The Bajau locals purportedly used this name to refer to a village in the southern part of the city which was filled with coconut trees. Another name was ''Singgah Mata'' which literally means "transit eye", but can be loosely translated as "pleasing to the eye". It is a name purportedly given by fishermen from Pulau Gaya referring to the strip of land which today is downtown Kota Kinabalu.<ref>{{cite web|author=Sawatan, Jackson|url=http://www.mykmu.net/modules.php?name=News&file=article&sid=2698|title=Adakah Gaya Sekadar 'Singgah mata' Untuk Pembangkang?|publisher=BERNAMA|accessdate=2007-03-08 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070929043515/http://www.mykmu.net/modules.php?name=News&file=article&sid=2698  |archivedate = 2007-09-29}}</ref> Today, all these names have been immortalised as names of streets or buildings around the city. Some examples are Lintasan Deasoka, Api-Api Centre and Jalan Singgah Mata.

==Capital city==

[[File:KKMap3.png|right|thumb|250px|A rough map of Kota Kinabalu city and urban area. Blue lines indicate main roads, grey lines indicate railway lines, and pink dotted lines indicate [[Districts of Malaysia|district]] boundaries.]]
Being the capital city of Sabah, Kota Kinabalu plays an important role in the political and economic welfare of the population of the entire state. It is the seat of the state government where almost all of their [[Ministry (government department)|ministries]] and [[Government agency|agencies]] are based. Most of the [[Politics of Malaysia|Malaysian federal government]] agencies and departments are also located in Kota Kinabalu. The Sabah State Legislative Assembly is located at the nearby Likas Bay. There are four [[Members of Parliament]] (MPs) representing the four [[List of Malaysian electoral districts|parliamentary constituencies]] in the city: Sepanggar (''P.171''), Kota Kinabalu (''P.172''), Putatan (''P.173''), and Penampang (''P.174''). The city also elects 9 representatives to the state legislature from the state assembly districts of Karambunai, Inanam, Likas, Api-Api, Luyang, Tanjung Aru, Petagas, Kepayan, and Moyog.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.spr.gov.my/index/parnstlass.htm|title=Parliament and State Legislative Assemblies|publisher=Election Commission of Malaysia|accessdate=2008-01-15 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071014013014/http://spr.gov.my/index/parnstlass.htm  |archivedate = 2007-10-14}}</ref>

===Local authority and city definition===
[[File:KotaKinabalu CityHall.jpg|left|thumb|[[Kota Kinabalu City Hall]].]]
The city is administered by the [[Kota Kinabalu City Hall]] (Dewan Bandaraya Kota Kinabalu). The current mayor of Kota Kinabalu is Abidin Madingkir, who took over from Datuk Iliyas Ibrahim on January 31, 2011. Datuk Iliyas in turn became the second [[mayor]] of the city after taking over from Datuk Abdul Ghani Rashid in 2006.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://thestar.com.my/metro/story.asp?sec=southneast&file=/2011/2/3/southneast/7911648|title=Abidin named new mayor|publisher=The Star|date=2011-02-03|accessdate=2013-05-21}}</ref> The city obtained [[Cities of Malaysia|city status]] on February 2, 2000<ref name=kk2/>, and prior to this it was administered by Majlis Perbandaran Kota Kinabalu (Kota Kinabalu Municipal Council/Kota Kinabalu Town Hall).

The city is defined within the borders of what is the [[Districts of Malaysia|district]], formerly the [[municipality]], of Kota Kinabalu. With an area of 351 square kilometres, it is the smallest but the most populous district in Sabah.<ref name="statbulletin" /> It encompasses [[Tanjung Aru]] and [[Kepayan]] in the south, up to [[Telipok]]  and [[Sepanggar]] in the north. The urban expanse of the city however extends into the district of [[Penampang]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://maps.google.com/?ie=UTF8&om=1&z=11&ll=5.944583,116.087036&spn=0.329866,0.466919&t=k|title=Satellite image of Kota Kinabalu|publisher=Google Maps|accessdate=2007-03-17}}</ref> on the south of the city border, which includes the towns of [[Donggongon]] and [[Putatan]]. The combined area of Kota Kinabalu (district) and the contiguous built up areas in Penampang and Putatan is known as [[Greater Kota Kinabalu]].<ref name="health sedia">{{cite web|url=http://www.sedia.com.my/SDC_EPP/GreaterKK_Overview_Healthcare.pdf|title=Greater Kota Kinabalu Healthcare Overview|publisher=Sabah Economic Development and Investment Authority (SEDIA)|accessdate=19 April 2012}}</ref> The district of Penampang has an area of 466 square kilometres, and is administered by Majlis Daerah Penampang (Penampang District Council).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sabah.gov.my/md.ppg/|title=Main Page|publisher=Penampang District Council|accessdate=2008-01-15}}</ref>

On one end of the scale, Kota Kinabalu may sometimes only refer to, especially by local inhabitants, the city centre or [[central business district]] near the sea facing Pulau Gaya. On the other end of the scale, it may also refer to the [[metropolitan area]] which includes urban Kota Kinabalu (Greater Kota Kinabalu), and the surrounding towns of [[Papar, Sabah|Papar]] and [[Kinarut]] in the south, and [[Tuaran]] and [[Tamparuli]] in the north, being within its zone of influence.

===International relations===
Several countries have set up their consulates in Kota Kinabalu, including [[Australia]], [[Brunei]], [[Finland]], [[Indonesia]], [[Japan]] and [[Sweden]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://iguide.travel/Kota_Kinabalu/Communication/Consulates |title=Kota Kinabalu Travel Guide - Mapcarta |publisher=Iguide.travel |date= |accessdate=2012-11-14}}</ref>

Kota Kinabalu currently has five [[sister cities]].

==Geography==
[[File:Sutera harbour sunset.jpg|left|thumb|Sunset over Sutera Harbour, Kota Kinabalu.]]
Kota Kinabalu is located on the west coast of Sabah. The city lies on a narrow flatland between the [[Crocker Range]] to the east and the [[South China Sea]] to the west. There are six islands off the coast of the city. The largest is [[Pulau Gaya|Gaya Island]], the site of the first British settlement. Approximately 8,000 people live there.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=/2006/8/5/nation/15060803&sec=nation|title=Cops storm Pulau Gaya, clash leaves one dead, four injured|publisher=The Star|date=2006-08-05}}</ref> The smaller islands, mainly uninhabited, are named Sapi Island, [[Pulau Manukan|Manukan Island]], Sulug Island, Mamutik Island and Sepanggar Island to the north.<ref>[http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&hl=en&geocode=&q=kota+Kinabalu&sll=37.0625,-95.677068&sspn=38.554089,67.851563&ie=UTF8&ll=5.997167,116.06884&spn=0.189501,0.265045&z=12 Google Maps, retrieved 2008-12-14]</ref> Sepanggar island is located north of the National Park opposite [[Sepanggar Bay]].

[[File:Sunset @Kota Kinabalu.jpg|right|thumb|Sunset at Kota Kinabalu.]]
Flat land is at a premium in the city centre, and there is a strict limit to the height of buildings: the airport is {{convert|7|km|0|abbr=on}} away, and the city is directly in the flight path. Most of the Central Business District (CBD) today is built on [[Land reclamation|land reclaimed]] from the sea.<ref name=bk1/> The original local plant life has largely disappeared, but several hills within the city (too steep for building) are still clothed with [[tropical rainforest]].

===Climate===
[[File:Coastal drive along KK.jpg|right|thumb|[[Coconut tree]]s on the roadside, [[tropical rainforest climate]] in Kota Kinabalu.]]
Kota Kinabalu features a [[tropical rainforest climate]], under the [[K<U+00F6>ppen climate classification]]. However, the city has noticeably wetter and drier seasons. February receives an average of 60mm of rainfall, which just qualifies for a tropical rainforest climate. Two prevailing monsoons characterize the climate of this part of Sabah, the Northeast [[Monsoon]] and the Southwest Monsoon. The Northeast Monsoon occurs between November and March with cooler temperatures and less rainfall, while the Southwest Monsoon occurs between May and September, which brings warmer temperatures and more rainfall. There are also two successive inter-monsoons from April to May and from September to October.<ref>Coastal Profile of Sabah, Sabah State Government website, retrieved 2008-12-14 [http://www.townplanning.sabah.gov.my/iczm/reports/Coastal%20Profile%20Sabah/ch03/03-CLIMATEI.htm 3 CLIMATE (Part I)]</ref>
Temperature variation throughout the year is small. However, April and May are generally the hottest months, while December and January are often the coolest. During this period (December and January), a surge of cold winds blowing from [[Siberia]] can occasionally cause the early morning temperature to drop to 20&nbsp;<U+00B0>C.<ref>Cooler mornings, Daily Express Newspaper Online, Sabah, Malaysia, retrieved 2010-9-17 [http://www.dailyexpress.com.my/news.cfm?NewsID=32049 Cooler mornings | Daily Express Newspaper Online, Sabah, Malaysia.]</ref> Rainfall varies markedly through the year. February and March are typically the driest months while rainfall peaks in the inter-monsoon period around October. Relative humidity is generally high throughout the year.<ref>{{cite web|title=Kota Kinabalu climate graphs|publisher=Allmetsat|accessdate=2008-12-14|url=http://en.allmetsat.com/climate/philippines.php?code=96471}}</ref>

==Demography==
There have not been any official or popular adjectives, or [[demonyms]], to describe the people of Kota Kinabalu. A simple way to describe the people of the city can be "''orang KK''", where ''orang'' means "person" or "people" in Malay. The terms "K.K-ites"<ref name="rapid" /> and "K.K-ians" have also been used to a limited extent. People from Sabah are called Sabahans.<ref name=sbh1>{{cite web|url=http://www.discoverytours.com.my/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=69&Itemid=45|title=PEOPLE OF SABAH|publisher=Discovery Tours Sabah|accessdate=2013-05-21}}</ref>

[[File:Sacred Heart RC Church.jpg|right|thumb|[[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Kota Kinabalu|Sacred Heart Cathedral]].]]

===Ethnicity and religion===
The Malaysian Census 2010 Report indicates that Kota Kinabalu has a population of 452,058.<ref name="stats">{{cite web|url=http://www.statistics.gov.my/portal/download_Population/files/population/04Jadual_PBT_negeri/PBT_Sabah.pdf|title=Population Distribution by Local Authority Areas and Mukims, 2010|date=December 2011|publisher=Statistics Department, Malaysia|accessdate=12 March 2012}}</ref>  The city's population today is a mixture of many different [[Race (classification of human beings)|races]] and [[Ethnic group|ethnicities]]. Non-Malaysian citizens form the majority of the city population with 110,556 people followed by [[Malaysian Chinese|Chinese]] (93,429), [[Bajau]] (72,931), [[Kadazandusun]] (69,993), other [[Bumiputras]] (59,607), [[Brunei Malay]]s<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thenutgraph.com/%E2%80%9Cnot-malays-full-stop%E2%80%9D/|entry=Actually in Sabah, there were no Malays. You were either Bajau, or Murut, or Orang Sungai. The closest to Malays were the Brunei Malays because they were originally from Brunei before settling in Sabah|title=<U+201C>Not Malays full stop<U+201D>|date=22 November 2010|publisher=The Nut Graph|accessdate=21 May 2013}}</ref> (35,835), [[Murut people|Murut]] (2,528), [[Malaysian Indian|Indian]] (2,207) and others (5,482).<ref name="stats" /> The Chinese are mostly [[Hakka people|Hakkas]] and can be found mainly in the Luyang area. The area of Penampang is populated mainly by Kadazans, while the Bajaus mainly reside in Likas, Sembulan and Karambunai. The Brunei Malays and Bajaus are [[Muslims]]. The Kadazans here mainly practice Christianity, whilst the Chinese are mainly [[Buddhism|Buddhists]] or Christians. There are a small number of [[Hindus]], [[Sikhs]], [[Animists]], and a small number of secularists also exist.

[[File:Kota Kinabalu city Mosque.jpg|left|thumb|[[Kota Kinabalu City Mosque|City Mosque]].]]

There is also a sizeable [[Filipino people|Filipino]] population in the city. The first wave of migrants arrived in the late 15th century during the [[History of the Philippines (1521-1898)|Spanish colonisation]], while some are refugees arriving in the early 1970s because of the troubles in southern Philippines. A significant number of them today, however, consist of migrant workers arriving from the late 1970s onwards. Most of the earlier migrants have been [[Naturalization|naturalised]] as Malaysian citizens, however there are still some living without proper documentation in the city as [[illegal immigrants]].<ref>{{cite web|author=Sadiq, Kamal|url=http://www.cri.uci.edu/pdf/ISQ2005FinalCopy.pdf|title=When States Prefer Non-Citizens Over Citizens: Conflict Over Illegal Immigration into Malaysia|work=International Studies Quarterly (2005) 49|pages=101<U+2013>122|publisher=University of California<U+2013>Irvine|accessdate=2007-03-13|format=PDF}}</ref> Most of the Filipino migrants are [[Tausug people|Suluks]] coming from the southern parts of Philippines. 

A large number of [[Indonesia]]ns also reside around the city, mostly coming from [[Sulawesi|Celebes]], [[Java]], [[Kalimantan]], [[Flores]] of the [[Lesser Sunda Islands]].<ref>{{cite web|author=Mantra, Ida Bagoes|year=1998|url=http://www.unesco.org/most/apmrlabo6.doc|title=Indonesian Labor Mobility to Malaysia (A Case Study: East Flores, West Lombok, and The Island of Bawean)|work=National Workshop on International Migration at Yogyakarta|publisher=Population Studies Center, Gadjah Mada University, Indonesia|accessdate=2007-03-15|format=DOC}}</ref>

[[File:CheSuiKhor-Pagoda Kota-Kinabalu-01.jpg|thumb|right|Che Sui Khor [[Pagoda]].]]
There is a small population of [[Indian Malaysian|Indians]], [[Pakistanis in Malaysia|Pakistanis]] and [[Eurasian (mixed ancestry)|Eurasians]] scattered around the city. More recently, the number of expatriates living in the city, whether temporarily or permanently, have also increased. Most of them come from [[South Korea]], [[Japan]], [[Australia]], and [[Europe]].

Interracial marriages are not uncommon and Kadazan-Chinese intermarriages are particularly common.<ref name=ck1>{{cite book|author=Chee-kiong Tong|title=Identity and Ethnic Relations in Southeast Asia: Racializing Chineseness|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=8bXnUL46_X0C&pg=PA110|accessdate=22 May 2013|year=2010|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-90-481-8909-0|pages=110<U+2013>}}</ref> The mixed race offspring of Kadazan and Chinese are referred to as Sino-Kadazans or simply "Sinos".<ref name=ck1/>

===Languages===
The people of Kota Kinabalu mainly speak [[Malay language|Malay]], with a distinct Sabahan [[Creole language|creole]].<ref name=sbh1/> However, as almost 50% of Kota Kinabalu residents are of Chinese descent,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hasil.gov.my/sgatar/general.html|title=3. ABOUT KOTA KINABALU, SABAH (SGATAR 2011)|publisher=Hasil.gov.my|year=2011|accessdate=2013-05-22}}</ref> [[Huizhou|Hu<U+00EC>y<U+00E1>ng]] [[Hakka (language)|Hakka]] dialect (Simplified Chinese: <U+60E0><U+9633><U+5BA2><U+5BB6><U+8BDD>; Traditional Chinese: <U+60E0><U+967D><U+5BA2><U+5BB6><U+8A71>) and [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]] are mainly spoken by the Chinese. Additionally, most Chinese are also able to speak the [[Cantonese]] dialect, although with widely varying levels of fluency. Almost all residents are also able to speak English, especially the younger generation. However, some find it difficult to speak fluently due to a limited vocabulary and the general lack of usage of the English language as a conversational lingua franca among Sabahans as a whole.   

The number of [[Coastal Kadazan language|Bahasa Kadazandusun]] speakers is thought to have dropped significantly throughout Sabah, especially in larger towns or cities like Kota Kinabalu. However, some effort has been taken by some to revive the usage of the language. Kadazan has been considered an [[endangered language]], along with the culture of ethnic Kadazans.<ref>{{cite web|author=Reid, Anthony|url=http://www.questia.com/PM.qst?a=o&se=gglsc&d=5000484947&er=deny|title=Endangered Identity: Kadazan or Dusun in Sabah|publisher=Journal of Southeast Asian Studies, Vol. 28|year=1997|accessdate=2008-01-15}}</ref>

==Economy==
[[File:Img edt mod2.jpg|left|thumb|Wisma [[Tun Fuad Stephens]].]]
Besides being the capital city, Kota Kinabalu is also the main industrial and commercial centre for Sabah. The economy is dominated by the [[primary sector of industry]]. Historically, the [[Secondary sector of industry|secondary sector]] dominated the economy, but due to rapid urbanisation and economic development, this sector of the economy is slowly diminishing. More recently, a move towards a more [[Tertiary sector of industry|tertiary-based industry]] has become more apparent, especially with regards to the boom in the tourism industry.<ref name="tourism" /> Many state-level, national-level and international commercial banks, as well as some [[insurance]] companies have their headquarters or branches here.

The overseas Chinese population also contributes to the development of KK since their immigration in the late 19th century.<ref name=cl1>{{cite web|url=http://www.persee.fr/web/revues/home/prescript/article/arch_0044-8613_1999_num_58_3_3538|title=Chinese Migration to Sabah Before the Second World War|publisher=Archipel|accessdate=2013-05-21}}</ref> Their original role involved '[[coolie]]' (slavery work) and today many Chinese work as shopowners.<ref name=cl1/>

A number of industrial and [[manufacturing]] companies also have [[Factory|plants]] here, especially in the [[industrial district]]s of Likas, Kolombong, and Inanam. The ongoing construction of the {{convert|8320|acre|km2|adj=on}} Kota Kinabalu Industrial Park (KKIP) in Sepanggar is intended to boost the city's industrial and commercial activity, making it a major growth centre in East Malaysia, as well for the BIMP-EAGA (Brunei-Indonesia-Malaysia-Philippines East ASEAN Growth Area) region.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kkip.com.my/DataBases/KKIPWeb.nsf/IntroPage?OpenPage|title=Introduction|publisher=Kota Kinabalu Industrial Park|accessdate=2007-04-09 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070930023621/http://www.kkip.com.my/DataBases/KKIPWeb.nsf/IntroPage?OpenPage  |archivedate = 2007-09-30}}</ref> Kota Kinabalu also hosts numerous national, regional, and international [[Business conference|conferences]] or [[trade fair]]s every year, including the biennial Sabah International Expo, the Asia Pacific eTourism Conference by the [[United Nations Conference on Trade and Development]] (UNCTAD), the ASEAN Australian Engineering Congress, and many others. These events are normally held at the Sutera Harbour resort.

==Transportation==

===Land===
The internal roads linking different parts of the city are generally [[Malaysian State Roads system|state roads]] constructed and maintained by the state's [[Malaysian Public Works Department|Public Works Department]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.townplanning.sabah.gov.my/iczm/Reports/Coastal%20Profile%20Sabah/ch14/14-TRANSPORT.html|title=Transport (Road Networks)|publisher=Sabah State Government|accessdate=2013-05-21}}</ref> Most major internal roads are [[dual-carriageways]]. One of the major roads here is Jalan Lintas-Jalan Tuaran Bypass, which together serves almost as a [[ring road]], circling the city and connecting the districts and suburbs surrounding the city, namely Putatan, Penampang, Luyang, Likas, Inanam, Menggatal, Sepanggar, and Tuaran.
