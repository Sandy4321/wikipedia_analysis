'''Arve Walde''' (born [[May 19]], [[1985]] in [[Bergen, Norway|Bergen]]) is a [[Football (soccer)|footballer]] from [[Bergen, Norway|Bergen]], [[Norway]]. He is a younger brother of club-colleague [[Knut Walde]].

== Career ==
Walde debuted for Brann's [[first team]] in 2003, but apart from a short period in 2004, he never managed to establish himself in the starting line-up. In 2006, Walde was loaned out to the local club [[L<U+00F8>v-Ham Fotball|L<U+00F8>v-Ham]], where he reunited with his brother [[Knut Walde|Knut]] who is the skipper on L<U+00F8>v-Ham. The clubs agreed on a one year loan deal, and the plan for Walde was to return to Brann after the 2006 season. Walde also signed a two-year contract with Brann before being loaned out to "The Lions". Before the 2007 season, however, he signed a contract making him L<U+00F8>v-Ham-player on a permanent basis.

== Trivia ==
*In a match on [[September 3]] [[2006]] against the top team [[Aalesunds F.K.|Aalesund]], both Arve and his brother Knut scored an own goal, causing [[L<U+00F8>v-Ham]] to lose 1<U+2013>2.

*Walde is a [[Christian]]. His favorite [[Bible verse]] is [[Zephaniah]] 3, chapter 17[http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Zephaniah+3:17]:
