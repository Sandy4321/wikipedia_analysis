'''HMS ''Bellerophon''''' was a [[battleship|dreadnought]] of the [[Royal Navy]]. She was the [[lead ship]] of the [[Bellerophon class battleship|''Bellerophon'' class]], and the fourth Royal Navy vessel to bear the name of the mythic Greek [[Bellerophon|hero]].  Built at the [[HMNB Portsmouth|Royal Dockyard]] in [[Portsmouth]] and completed in 1909, ''Bellerophon'' first joined the [[1st Battle Squadron (United Kingdom)|1st Battle Squadron]] and then upon the outbreak of war joined the [[4th Battle Squadron (United Kingdom)|4th Battle Squadron]] where she remained until 1919.  She was present at the [[Battle of Jutland]] where she fired sixty-two 12&nbsp;inch rounds and received no damage.  With the end of the war she was placed in the Reserve Fleet and sold for scrap in 1921 before being taken to the breakers two years later.

==Design==

While revolutionary, [[HMS Dreadnought (1906)|HMS ''Dreadnought'']] had been revealed to have certain shortcomings.  Her secondary armament was judged to be insufficient to combat the increased size of [[torpedo boats]], regarded at the time as the principal threat to major surface warships.  Hence her secondary armament was strengthened, her anti-torpedo protection was improved in the shape of continuous anti-torpedo bulkheads running from the front of the fore magazine to the rear of the aft magazine.

Externally she looked similar, having the same main armament layout of 5 twin 12&nbsp;inch mounts, secondary armament mounted in casemates on the superstructure and upon the deck and lighter guns atop the turrets.  A torpedo-control tower aft completed the profile.  The ''Bellerophon'' was different in having two tripod masts to facilitate sea keeping in peacetime.  The 12&nbsp;inch British dreadnoughts would be unique when later they were fitted with two sets of Fire-control equipment.

She was built with 18 Babcock boilers arranged in 3 groups of 6.  Her machinery, constructed by Fairfield, consisted of 4 [[Parsons Marine Steam Turbines|Parsons]] single reduction [[steam turbine]]s driving 4 shafts producing 23,000 [[Horsepower#Shaft horsepower|shp]] (17&nbsp;MW).  Due to the scaling down of coal bunkerage, her range of 5,720&nbsp;nautical miles (10,593&nbsp;km) at 10&nbsp;knots (18.5&nbsp;km/h) was considered middling at best.  Her machinery was provided by [[Fairfield Shipbuilding and Engineering Company]], [[Govan]].

==Career==

Laid down the month HMS ''Dreadnought'' was commissioned, ''Bellerophon'' was the name ship of the ''Bellerophon'' class and was the first to be completed.  The cost of building was <U+00A3>1,763,491, making the most expensive of her class.  She was laid down on 6 December 1906, launched 27 July 1907 and commissioned into the fleet on 20 February 1909.  On trials she made 21.25&nbsp;knots, a speed lower than that of her sisters due to inferior shp; 25,061&nbsp;shp as opposed to [[HMS Superb (1907)|HMS ''Superb'']]'s 27,407&nbsp;shp and [[HMS Temeraire (1907)|HMS ''Temeraire'']]'s 26,966&nbsp;shp.

Upon completion she joined the 1st Battle Squadron of the [[British Home Fleet|Home Fleet]].  On 26 May 1911 she was in collision with the battlecruiser [[HMS Inflexible (1907)|HMS ''Inflexible'']].  ''Bellerophon'' received damage whilst ''Inflexible'' took bow damage which put her in the dockyard until November.  On 1 August 1914, after the Fleet Mobilisation and the formation of the [[British Grand Fleet|Grand Fleet]] she joined the 4th Battle Squadron.

On the journey to the fleet anchorage at [[Scapa Flow]], ''Bellerophon'' collided with the vessel SS ''St Clair'' on 27 August off the [[Orkney Islands]] but sustained no major damage.  In May 1915 She headed to the [[HMNB Devonport|Royal Dockyard, Devonport]] for a refit.

At the Battle of Jutland the vessel was under the command of Captain [[Edward F. Bruen]] in the Fourth Division (commanded by Rear Admiral [[Alexander Duff]]) of the 4th Battle Squadron under Vice Admiral [[Doveton Sturdee]].  The 4th Battle Squadron deployed behind the 2nd battle squadron in line ahead in the main part of the battle, and ''Bellerophon'' fired 62 12&nbsp;inch rounds without receiving one hit.

After the battle she swept with the other vessels of the Grand Fleet regularly.  Between June and September, 1917 she served as the flagship of the 2ic of the 4th Battle Squadron, carrying the flag of Rear Admiral [[Roger Keyes]] and then Rear Admiral [[Douglas Nicholson]].  Unlike her sister ships she was not deployed to the [[British Eastern Mediterranean Squadron|Eastern Mediterranean Squadron]] in October, 1918.

Placed in reserve in 1919 by dint of their less powerful main armamnent, she and sister ship ''[[HMS Superb (1907)|Superb]]'' were used as Gunnery Schools (Turret Drills). HMS ''Bellerophon'' was sold to the breakers in November 1921 and broken up in 1923.

The ship in profile can be seen on the ten-dollar note from the [[Royal Bank of Canada]] issued in 1913
