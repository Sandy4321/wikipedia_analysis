'''Toni Michelle Braxton''' (born October 7, 1967)  is an American [[Contemporary R&B|R&B]] singer, songwriter and actress. Braxton has won six [[Grammy Award]]s, seven [[American Music Awards]], and five [[Billboard Music Awards]] and has sold over 40 million records worldwide. She has a [[contralto]] vocal range.

Braxton topped the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] with her 1993 self-titled debut album and continued that streak with her second studio album ''[[Secrets (Toni Braxton album)|Secrets]]'', which spawned the number-one hits "[[You're Makin' Me High]]" and "[[Un-Break My Heart]]". Although she had successful albums and singles, Braxton shortly filed for bankruptcy, but then returned with her chart-topping third album, ''[[The Heat (Toni Braxton album)|The Heat]]''. In 2009, she returned to the spotlight with "[[Yesterday (Toni Braxton song)|Yesterday]]", a #12 R&B hit which serves as the first single off her new album  ''[[Pulse (Toni Braxton album)|Pulse]]'', released on May 4, 2010, which debuted at #1 on ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' R&B Album Chart.<ref name="radio1.gr">{{cite web|author=Praxis Media |url=http://www.radio1.gr/music/forthcoming_uk_albums.htm |title=Radio1 Rodos Greece ::: UK Forthcoming Albums ::: Charts, DJ Promos, Dance, Lyrics, Free Mp3 Samples Downloads |publisher=Radio1.gr |date= |accessdate=2010-11-12}}</ref> Braxton was involved in the [[Dancing with the Stars (U.S. season 7)|7th season]] of the reality show ''[[Dancing with the Stars]]''. Her professional partner was [[Alec Mazo]]. She was voted off in week five of the competition. It was announced on October 6, 2010 that Braxton once again had filed for bankruptcy. A reality series entitled [[Braxton Family Values]], starring Toni and her sisters, debuted April 12, 2011 on [[WE tv]].

==Life and career==
===Early life and education ===
Toni's father was a [[Methodist]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.adherents.com/largecom/fam_meth.html |title=Famous Methodists |publisher=Adherents.com |date= |accessdate=2010-11-12}}</ref> clergyman, and the Braxton children were raised in a strict religious household.<ref name="psu">{{cite web|url=http://www.premiumseatsusa.com/concert/Toni-Braxton/ |title=Toni Braxton Tickets|accessdate=2006-12-18|format=|work=Premium Seats USA}}</ref> Braxton's first performing experience was singing in her church choir.<ref name="psu"/>

She attended [[Bowie State University]] to obtain a teaching degree<ref>{{Cite news|first=Joy Bennett|last=Kinnon|title=The Rise and Fall and Rise of Toni Braxton|work=Ebony |date= December 2000|accessdate=June 6, 2009}}</ref> but decided to sing professionally after she was discovered by William E.

===1989<U+2013>92: ''The Braxtons''===
{{Main|The Braxtons}}
Braxton and her four sisters (Traci, [[Trina Braxton|Trina]], [[Towanda Braxton|Towanda]], and [[Tamar Braxton|Tamar]]) began performing as ''[[The Braxtons]]'' in the late 1980s and were signed to [[Arista Records]] in 1989. Their first single, "[[Good Life (The Braxtons song)|Good Life]]", was released in 1990.<ref name="vibe">{{cite web|url=http://www.vibe.com/music/search/artist.html?id=UCAgICAzNzU3Ng |title=Toni Braxton |accessdate=2006-12-18 |work=VIBE.com }}</ref> Though the song was not successful, it attracted the attention of [[L.A. Reid|Antonio "L.A." Reid]] and [[Kenneth "Babyface" Edmonds]].<ref name="vibe"/>

With Braxton's low register sounding similar to that of [[Anita Baker]],{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} Reid and Babyface recruited her to record a demo of "Love Shoulda Brought You Home", a song that they had written for Anita Baker for the soundtrack of [[Eddie Murphy]]'s film, ''[[Boomerang (1992 film)|Boomerang]]''. Baker, who was pregnant at the time,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://uk.askmen.com/women/singer/8c_toni_braxton.html |title=Toni Braxton |accessdate=2006-12-18 |work=AskMen }}</ref> did not record the song but suggested that Braxton record it. Her recording was later included on the soundtrack along with "[[Give U My Heart]]", a duet by Braxton and Babyface. Braxton, meanwhile, was signed to Reid and Edmonds' Arista-distributed imprint, [[LaFace Records]], and immediately began recording her solo debut album.

===1999<U+2013>01: ''The Heat''===
In March 2000, LaFace Records released "[[He Wasn't Man Enough]]", the first single from Braxton's third studio album, ''[[The Heat (Toni Braxton album)|The Heat]]''. By June 2000, the song peaked at number two on the Hot 100 chart.

''The Heat'' was released on April 25, 2000. Debuting at number two on the ''Billboard'' 200 albums chart with first week sales of 194,448 copies sold,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hitsdailydouble.com/sales/archcht.cgi?cht692 |title=Previous Album Sales Chart |publisher=HITS Daily Double |date= |accessdate=2010-11-12}}</ref> it remained in the top 20 for fifteen consecutive weeks. Braxton again worked with producers Babyface and Foster; also included in the staple were [[Rodney Jerkins]], and new beau musician [[Keri Lewis]]. Braxton herself also took a more hands-on approach, co-writing and co-producing a handful of the tracks. "Gimme Some", a track on "The Heat", featured a rap verse from [[TLC (band)|TLC]] star [[Lisa Lopes|Lisa "Left-Eye" Lopes]].

The albums second single, "[[Just Be a Man About It]]", peaked at number 32 on the Hot 100 and number six on the R&B Charts.

She also received the 2000 Aretha Franklin Award for Entertainer of the Year at the Soul Train Lady of Soul Awards.

It won Best R&B/Soul Album at the 2001 [[American Music Award]]s, her third win in a row. {{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}

In 2002, while gearing up for the release of her fourth studio album, Braxton discovered she was pregnant with her second child. Knowing that she wouldn't be able to promote the album properly, she unsuccessfully lobbied [[Arista Records]] to get the label to postpone its release until after she was to give birth. [[Arista Records]] refused and the album was released as planned in November 2002. It received very little promotion from Arista and Braxton herself, due to a complicated pregnancy that confined her to [[bed rest]]. Braxton accused the company of being unwilling to compromise and punishing her from not putting her career over family. On the show ''[[VH1]] Inside Out&nbsp;<U+2014> Family Comes First'', she documented the hardships of being pregnant with her second child at the same time as promoting an album. {{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}

===2002<U+2013>04: ''More Than a Woman''===
In November 2002, Braxton's fourth studio album ''[[More Than a Woman (album)|More Than a Woman]]'' was released.  Opening to an instant commercial disappointment, the album peaked at number 13.  The first single, [[The Neptunes]]-produced "[[Hit the Freeway]]", failed at radio and peaked at number 86 on the Hot 100. The two singles that followed ("A Better Man", "Lies, Lies, Lies") also failed to make a dent and missed the Hot 100 completely. Meanwhile, a promotional vinyl was sent out to DJs for "Give It Back"/"Let Me Show You the Way (Out)". {{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}

''More Than A Woman'' was certified gold by [[RIAA]] and sold more 800,000 copies worldwide.<ref name="musicmp3.ru">{{cite web|url=http://musicmp3.ru/artist_toni-braxton.html |title=Toni Braxton mp3 music download |publisher=MusicMp3.Ru |date= |accessdate=2010-11-12}}</ref><ref>name= RIAA</ref>

Prior to the release of the album, a dispute erupted between Braxton and [[Irv Gotti]] when he played a rough cut of "No More Love", a song that he produced for the album that was to be the first single. Disapproving of Gotti broadcasting the unfinished track, Braxton withheld it from being released. The same year, Braxton was further annoyed when [[Jay-Z]] used the same sample of [[Tupac Shakur|2Pac]]'s "Me And My Girlfriend" that she had already used on her track "Me & My Boyfriend" for his and Beyonc<U+00E9>'s "[['03 Bonnie & Clyde]]". Furious, Braxton lashed out in a radio interview, accusing Jay-Z and producer [[Kanye West]] of taking money out of her children's college fund. {{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}

===2003<U+2013>06: ''Libra''===
In April 2003, Braxton abruptly left Arista Records, having been there for fourteen years, and immediately signed with [[Blackground Records]]<U+2014>headed by [[Barry Hankerson]], her manager at the time. The change of scenery, however, did not ultimately help her recording career. As had been the case during her final years at Arista<U+2014>Braxton's fifth album, and first release on Blackground, ''Libra'' was released with scant promotion and accumulated poor sales. {{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}

In April 2005, Braxton's new label, Blackground/Universal, released "[[Please (Toni Braxton song)|Please]]"<U+2014>the first single from her fifth album, ''[[Libra (album)|Libra]]''. The album was originally planned for a June release, but it was pushed back several times and was finally issued on September 27. Unfortunately for Braxton, her troubles with weak album promotion and lack of label commitment weren't over. "Please" peaked at number 36 on ''Billboard'' Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs, while altogether missing the Hot 100. The album lacked promotion by Blackground, causing it to go under the radar of many. {{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}

Despite this, ''Libra'' still managed to debut at number four on the ''Billboard'' 200 selling 114,593 copies in the first week. ''Libra'' also peaked at number two on the Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums. Although that is strong for an album with little to no promotion, it became yet another commercial disappointment for Braxton. The album's second single, "[[Trippin' (That's the Way Love Works)]]" received less airplay and peaked at number 67 on the R&B chart. The failure was ascribed to the non-video presence of the single and lack of label support. The album was certified gold in late 2005 and has since sold 679,000 copies worldwide.<ref name="musicmp3.ru"/>

Braxton, meanwhile, recorded a song with [[Il Divo]] titled "[[The Time of Our Lives]]". The song was used as the official [[2006 FIFA World Cup]] anthem and was performed at the championship's opening day in [[Berlin, Germany]] on June 9. The song was also performed at the closing ceremonies making Braxton and Il Divo the first artists to be asked to perform for the opening and closing ceremonies.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/tm_objectid=16862049&method=full&siteid=94762&headline=fiona--divo--name_page.html|title=FIONA: DIVO|accessdate=2006-12-18 |work=Mirror.co.uk}}</ref> The song peaked at number 17 in Germany. As a result [[Edel Music|Edel Records]] decided to re-release ''Libra'' in Germany, including a new album cover, artwork, and the new anthem. {{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}

Braxton made an appearance on the season finale of ''[[American Idol (season 5)|American Idol 5]]'' where she performed [[Elvis Presley]]'s "[[In the Ghetto]]" with soon-to-be winner [[Taylor Hicks]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1532468/20060524/hicks__taylor.jhtml|title=Soul Patrol Rides On: Taylor Hicks Wins 'American Idol'|accessdate=2006-12-27|work=MTV News|date=May 25, 2006}}</ref>

Braxton Later confirmed that she was extending her show through August 2007. The show became the first headlining show from an African American performer in Las Vegas to enter the top ten Vegas shows charting. Due to the success of the show, it was reported that Braxton would extend her show through August 2008. The singer subsequently took time off after being hospitalized for chest pains in April 2008. {{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}
The show was later cancelled, and it was announced that the show was officially shut down in order for the singer to focus on her health.<ref>[http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20203349,00.html?xid=rss-fullcontentcnn ''People'' magazine article]</ref>

Braxton has been released from her contract with Blackground after a number of disputes with former manager Barry Hankerson.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://today.reuters.com/news/articlenews.aspx?type=musicNews&storyID=2007-01-13T010920Z_01_N12149797_RTRIDST_0_MUSIC-BRAXTON-DC.XML&WTmodLoc=EntNewsMusic_C2_musicNews-2|title='Toni Braxton parts ways with label'|accessdate=2007-01-12|format=|work=MTV News|date=May 25, 2006}}</ref>

On January 12, 2007, Braxton filed a lawsuit in the [[U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York|U.S District Court in Manhattan]] against Hankerson for $10 million, alleging "fraud, deception and double dealing," in addition to mismanaging her relationship with Arista Records.<ref name=tbmgr>[http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2007/01/13/ap/entertainment/mainD8MK2I400.shtml "Toni Braxton sues her former manager"], Larry Neumeister, [[Associated Press|AP]] via [[CBS News]].com, January 13, 2007.
