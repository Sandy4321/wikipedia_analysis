'''''The Fifth Element''''' ({{lang-fr|link=no|'''Le Cinqui<U+00E8>me <U+00C9>l<U+00E9>ment'''}}) is a 1997 English-language French [[science fiction film]] directed, co-written, and based on a story by [[Luc Besson]]. The film stars [[Bruce Willis]], [[Gary Oldman]], and [[Milla Jovovich]]. Mostly set during the twenty-third century, the film's central plot involves the survival of planet [[Earth]], which becomes the duty of Korben Dallas (Willis), a [[taxicab]] driver and former [[special forces]] [[Major]], when a young woman (Jovovich) falls into his taxicab. Upon learning about her significance, Dallas must join efforts with the girl to recover four mystical stones essential to defending Earth from an impending attack.

Besson started writing the story that would become ''The Fifth Element'' when he was 16 years old; he was 38 when the film opened in cinemas.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.allrovi.com/movies/movie/v154944 |title=The Fifth Element (1997) |work=[[AllRovi]] |publisher= |accessdate=11 May 2013}}</ref> Comic book writers [[Jean Giraud]] and [[Jean-Claude M<U+00E9>zi<U+00E8>res]] were hired for the films production design, and costume design was done by [[Jean-Paul Gaultier]].

''The Fifth Element'' received mainly positive reviews, though it tended to polarize critics. It has been called both the best and worst summer blockbuster of all time. The film was a financial success, earning over $263 million at the box office on a $90 million budget. It was the most expensive European film ever made at the time of its release,<ref name=alice/> and remained the most financially successful French film until the release of ''[[The Intouchables]]'' in 2011.<ref name=intouchable>{{cite web |url=http://www.ozap.com/actu/-intouchables-plus-gros-succes-de-l-histoire-pour-un-film-non-anglophone/440005 |title="Intouchables": Plus Gros Succ<U+00E9>s De L'histoire Pour Un Film Non-Anglohone |last1= |first1= |language=French |date=March 21, 2012 |work=ozap.com |publisher= |accessdate=May 30, 2013}}</ref>

==Plot==
In 1914, at the outbreak of [[World War I]], [[Extraterrestrial life|extraterrestrials]] known as Mondoshawans arrive at an ancient Egyptian temple to collect from a secret chamber, for safekeeping, the only weapon capable of defeating a Great Evil that appears every five thousand years. The weapon consists of four stones, representing the four [[classical elements]], and a [[sarcophagus]] that contains a Fifth Element in the form of a human, which combines the power of the other four elements into a "Divine Light". The Mondoshawans promise their human contact, a priest, they will return with the Elements in time to stop the Great Evil, but an accident forces them to give their key to the chamber to the priest and instruct him to pass it on to future generations until they return.

In the mid 23rd century, the Great Evil appears in [[outer space|space]] in the form of a giant ball of black fire and destroys an Earth battleship. The current holder of the Mondoshawan key, priest Vito Cornelius ([[Ian Holm]]), informs President Lindberg ([[Tom Lister, Jr.]]) of the history of the Great Evil and the weapon that can stop it. As the Mondoshawans return to Earth, they are ambushed by the [[shapeshifting]] Mangalores, the remnants of an outlawed, warlike alien race hired by the industrialist Jean-Baptiste Emanuel Zorg ([[Gary Oldman]]), who was himself hired by the Great Evil to dispose of the element stones. The Mondoshawan's spacecraft is destroyed and the only thing Earth scientists recover is the hand of the Fifth Element, which they use to construct a humanoid woman, known as "Leeloo" ([[Milla Jovovich]]). Terrified of her unfamiliar surroundings, she escapes confinement and jumps off a ledge to land in the flying taxicab of Korben Dallas ([[Bruce Willis]]), a former major in the [[Special Forces]].

Dallas delivers Leeloo to Cornelius and his apprentice, David ([[Charlie Creed-Miles]]), whereupon Cornelius learns that the four Element stones were entrusted to Diva Plavalaguna ([[Ma<U+00EF>wenn Le Besco]]), an opera singer. Because the Mangalores failed to obtain the stones, Zorg kills them, but their compatriots attempt to obtain the Elements for themselves. Upon learning from the Mondoshawans that Plavalaguna has the stones, General Munro ([[Brion James]]), Dallas' former superior, re-enlists Dallas and orders him to travel undercover, as a rigged radio contest winner, to meet the Diva on a luxury cruise in space. The publicity of the contest attracts the Mangalores and Zorg to the space liner. Dallas takes Leeloo with him, while Cornelius instructs David to prepare the temple and stows away aboard the vessel.

The Diva is killed when the Mangalores attack and take over the ship, but Dallas retrieves the Elements from the Diva's body. He fights the Mangalores to liberate the ship, killing their leader. Zorg searches for the Elements; he shoots and seriously wounds Leeloo, before finding a carrying case. Assuming the elements are inside, he takes the case and leaves behind a [[time bomb]] that causes the liner's occupants to evacuate. Zorg departs on his spacecraft but discovers the case to be empty, so he returns to search for the Elements. He deactivates the bomb, but a dying Mangalore activates his own bomb, destroying the ship and killing Zorg, while Dallas, Cornelius, Leeloo, and talk-show host Ruby Rhod ([[Chris Tucker]]) escape with the Elements aboard Zorg's spacecraft.

The four return to the weapon chamber at the Egyptian temple as the Great Evil approaches. The group arranges the stones; but Leeloo has become disenchanted with humanity after having come to witness the brutality of war and violence and refuses to release the Divine Light. Dallas confesses his love for Leeloo and kisses her. In response, Leeloo combines the power of the stones and releases the Divine Light, causing the Great Evil to become dormant as a new moon in Earth's orbit.

Earth scientists assure President Lindberg that the Great Evil is dead. Korben and Leeloo are brought in by scientists and placed together in a healing tank to recuperate. When the President arrives and demands to see them one of the scientists informs him that "they need&nbsp;... five more minutes", as Korben and Leeloo have begun [[Consummation|consummating]] their love.

==Themes==
In an interview Besson stated ''The Fifth Element'' was not a "big theme movie", though the films theme was an important one. He wanted viewers to reach the point where Leeloo states "What's the use of saving life when you see what you do with it?", and agree with her.<ref name=stephen/> One review stated the film relied on the broad themes of "human fallibility and perfection, evil, and the all-conquering power of love."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://letterboxd.com/walypala/film/the-fifth-element/ |title=The Fifth Element |last1=Scott |first1=Michael  |date=March 5, 2013 |work=[[Letterboxd]] |accessdate=June 20, 2013}}</ref> The film has also been credited with exploring the theme of political corruption.<ref>{{cite book |last=Telotte |first=J.

==Production==
[[File:Science Fiction Museum and Hall of Fame 8c.jpg|thumb|Pistol used by Bruce Willis as Maj. Korben Dallas ([[Science Fiction Museum and Hall of Fame]], Seattle)]]
Besson envisioned the entire world of ''The Fifth Element'' as a teenager to escape boredom. He states he was waiting to build a reputation for himself as a filmmaker before he commenced production of the film, so that he would be able to make it with [[Artistic control|creative control]].<ref name=stephen>{{cite web |url=http://www.industrycentral.net/director_interviews/LB01.HTM |title=

Besson met Bruce Willis a few years before production started and talked about the project, though he later decided to instead search for a relatively unknown young actor for the role of Korben, so as to spend less on actors and more on sets, costumes and special effects. Willis approached Besson expressing he was still interested in the film, and after Besson explained the issue, Willis responded "You know, Luc, if I like it, we will find a way." Willis made a deal with the production team for the role, a move which greatly pleased Besson. A casting call of 8,000 went out for the character Leeloo, and Besson chose Milla Jovovich from the 200<U+2013>300 applicants he met in person.<ref name=stephen/>

Besson was in a relationship with Ma<U+00EF>wenn Le Besco, who played the role of Diva Plavalaguna, for 6 years when filming commenced; however, he left her for Jovovich during filming.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://anthemmagazine.com/film-critic-maiwenns-polisse/ |title=Film Critic: Ma<U+00EF>wenn's "Polisse" |last1= Change|first1=Kee|date=5 May 2012 |work=anthemmagazine.com |publisher= |accessdate=19 May 2013}}</ref> Jovovich and Besson were later married though they divorced in 1999.<ref name=yahoo/>

Besson chose to hire Gary Oldman, who had starred in his previous film, ''[[L<U+00E9>on: The Professional]]'', for the role of Zorg, describing Oldman as "one of the top five actors in the world".<ref name=stephen/>

===Critical reaction and legacy===
''The Fifth Element'' holds a "fresh" 71% approval rating at [[Rotten Tomatoes]] based on 56 reviews, with the consensus, "Visually inventive and gleefully over the top, Luc Besson's ''The Fifth Element'' is a fantastic piece of pop sci-fi that never takes itself too seriously."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/fifth_element/ |title=The Fifth Element Movie Reviews, Pictures |publisher=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] |accessdate=11 May 2013}}</ref> It has a weighted score of 52/100 at [[Metacritic]] based on 22 professional reviews.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/the-fifth-element |title=The Fifth Element |work=[[Metacritic]] |publisher= |accessdate=11 May 2013}}</ref>

''The Fifth Element'' polarized critics on release. Kevin Thomas of the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' described the film as an "elaborate, even campy sci-fi extravaganza, which is nearly as hard to follow as last year's ''[[Mission: Impossible (film)|Mission: Impossible]]''." He concluded that ''The Fifth Element'' was "a lot warmer, more fun and boasts some of the most sophisticated, witty production and costume design you could ever hope to see."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://articles.latimes.com/1997-05-09/entertainment/ca-56892_1_fifth-element |title='Element': A Voyage as Fun, Stylish as It Is Confusing |last1=Thomas |first1=Kevin |date=9 May 1997 |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |publisher= |accessdate=12 May 2013}}</ref> On film review show ''[[At the Movies (U.S. TV series)|At the Movies]]'', both [[Roger Ebert]] and [[Gene Siskel]] gave the film a 'thumbs up';<ref>{{cite episode |title= Week of May 10, 1997: ''The Fifth Element'' review|episodelink= |series= [[At the Movies (U.S. TV series)|At the Movies]]|serieslink= |credits= |network= |airdate= 10 May 1997|season= 11|seriesno= |number= 35|minutes= }}</ref> in his own review for the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'', Ebert gave the film 3 stars out of 4, calling it "One of the great goofy movies", and concluding, "I would not have missed seeing this film, and I recommend it for its richness of imagery.

[[Alejandro Jodorowsky]] and [[Jean Giraud]] sued Luc Besson after the film was released, claiming ''The Fifth Element'' had plagiarized their comic ''[[The Incal]]''. Giraud sued for 13.1 million euros for unfair competition, 9 million euros in damages and interest and for 2<U+2013>5% of the net operating revenues of the film. Jodorowsky sued for 700,000 euros. The case was dismissed in 2004 on the grounds that only "tiny fragments" of Giraud's artwork had been used<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.toutenbd.com/article.php3?id_article=697 |title=Moebius perd son proc<U+00E8>s contre Besson |date=28 May 2004 |work=toutenbd.com |language=French |accessdate=11 May 2013}}</ref> and also due to the fact that Giraud had been hired by Besson to work on the film before the allegations were made.<ref name=av/>

Rumors after the film's release reported a sequel, tentatively titled ''Mr. Shadow,'' in development.

An "Ultimate Edition" DVD was released on 11 January 2005.<ref name=dvd/><ref name=dvdtalk/> The edition contained two discs. The first contained the Superbit quality version of the film along with subtitles in the same six languages. The only difference between the Superbit version and the Ultimate Edition disc one is the addition of a "fact track", which when turned on displays trivia about the film, cast and crew as the film plays. The second disc provides various special features, focusing on visual production, special effects, fashion in the film, [[featurettes]] and interviews with Willis, Jovovich and Tucker, featurettes on the four different alien races in the film, and a featurette on Diva Plavalaguna. The Ultimate Edition was praised for its special features.<ref name=dvdtalk>{{cite web |url=http://www.dvdtalk.com/reviews/13970/fifth-element-ultimate-edition-the/ |title=The Fifth Element <U+2013> Ultimate Edition |work=dvdtalk.com |publisher= |accessdate=11 May 2013}}</ref><ref name=dawn/>
