'''James S. Allen''', born Sol Auerbach, (1906<U+2013>1986) was an American [[Marxist]] historian, journalist, editor, political activist, and functionary of the [[Communist Party USA]]. Allen is best remembered as the author and editor of over two dozen books and pamphlets and as one of the Communist Party's leading experts on [[African-American history]].

==Biography==
===Early years===

Sol Auerbach, later known by the [[pseudonym]] James S. Allen, was born in [[Philadelphia]], [[Pennsylvania]] in 1906.  

Upon completion of high school, Allen enrolled at the [[University of Pennsylvania]], an [[Ivy League]] university in Philadelphia, where he studied [[philosophy]].

===Political career===

A committed radical from his collegiate days, Auerbach traveled to the [[Soviet Union]] in 1927 as part of the first American student delegation to the [[Soviet Union]].

Auerbach was expelled from college 1928 for radical activities. He joined the Communist Party and began writing for the party newspaper, ''[[Daily Worker|The Daily Worker]].'' The intelligent Auerbach was soon promoted to the editorship of ''[[Labor Defender]],'' official organ of the [[International Labor Defense]] <U+2014> the Communist Party's [[mass organization]] dedicated to [[civil rights]] and [[legal aid]] matters.<ref name=Kelley16>Robin D.G. Kelley, ''Hammer and Hoe: Alabama Communists During the Great Depression.'' Chapel Hill, NC: University of North Carolina Press, 1990; pg. 16.</ref>

During his formative years in Philadelphia Auerbach had developed a strong interest in [[African American]] life, which lead to his appointment in 1930 as editor of the Communist Party's first newspaper produced south of the [[Mason-Dixon line]] <U+2014> ''The Southern Worker.''<ref name=Solomon85>Mark Solomon, ''The Cry was Unity: Communists and African Americans, 1917-36.'' Jackson: University Press of Mississippi, 1998; pg. 85.</ref> Auerbach adopted the [[pseudonym|Party name]] "James S. Allen" at this time and he traveled to [[Chattanooga, Tennessee]] with his wife Isabelle Allen to establish and edit the weekly paper.<ref>Solomon, ''The Cry was Unity,'' pg. 192.</ref> Necessarily produced under clandestine conditions, ''The Southern Worker'' bore a false dateline indicating it was produced in [[Birmingham, Alabama]] in an effort to confuse local police and the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]].<ref name=Kelley16 />

''The Southern Worker'' was launched on August 16, 1930, with a print run of 3,000 copies.<ref name=Kelley16 /> Although billed as "a paper of and for both the white and black workers and farmers,"<ref name=Kelley16 /> in actual fact the content was heavily skewed towards coverage of the daily life and problems of the region's black population.<ref>Kelley, ''Hammer and Hoe,'' pg. 17.</ref>

In this capacity Allen consistently advocated for the Communist Party's political line of the day, which included a demand for [[self-determination]] of the so-called "[[Black Belt (U.S. region)|Black Belt]]" of the American South, populated at the time by nearly one-half of the country's entire African-American population.<ref name=Solomon85 />

Despite breathless speculation at the time and thereafter that the Communist [[slogan|mobilizing slogan]] "Self-Determination for the Black Belt" was a call for national [[secession]], Allen later dismissed this view with the words "we weren't stupid."<ref name=Solomon113>Solomon, ''The Cry was Unity,'' pg. 113.</ref> For all the brashness of the "self-determination" slogan, in the view of historian Mark Solomon the actual meaning of the phrase was rather more modest:

<blockquote>
"Self-determination was defined as democracy at its essence: self-government, self-organization, [[social equality|social]] and economic equality, the right of blacks to run their own lives without the relentless terror and [[racism]] that dogged their steps and made every waking day a living hell."<ref name=Solomon113 /></blockquote>

As a member of the Party's Southern District committee, Allen played a prominent role in all of the CPUSA's major regional activities during the early 1930s; the organizing of [[Alabama]] [[sharecropper]]s, the [[Harlan, Kentucky]] miners' strike and the [[Scottsboro case]].

At the behest of the [[Communist International]], Allen was sent to [[Manila]], capital of the [[Philippines]] (then an American protectorate) in 1938 with instructions to end sectarian squabbling and achieve unity between the [[Partido Komunista ng Pilipinas-1930|Communist Party of the Philippines]] and the rival [[Philippine Socialist Party]], established in 1933.<ref name=Jaffe174>Philip J. Jaffe, ''The Rise and Fall of American Communism.'' New York: Horizon Press, 1975; pg. 174.</ref> This was accomplished successfully, with Allen writing a long and detailed report on his trip on February 13, 1939, shortly after his return to America.<ref name=Jaffe174 />

Allen was drafted into the [[United States Army]] in 1944.

During the [[Cold War]] years, he served as foreign editor of the ''[[Sunday Worker]]'' and was compelled to appear as a witness before the [[House Un-American Activities Committee]].

On February 21, 1952, Allen was called before the [[Senate Judiciary Committee]], chaired by Senator [[Pat McCarran]] of [[Nevada]], in conjunction with its investigation of the [[Institute of Pacific Relations]].<ref>Allen's testimony is found in Senate Judiciary Committee, ''Hearings, Institute of Pacific Relations <U+2014> Part 13,'' pp. 2876-2896.</ref>

===Later years===

From 1958-1966, Allen was the secretary of the [[Communist Party of the United States of America]] (CPUSA)'s National Program Committee, which was charged with developing a new program for the CPUSA.

He authored the initial drafts of the program, which was not published until 1970, and corresponded with prominent communists including [[Herbert Aptheker]], [[William Z. Foster]], [[John Howard Lawson]], [[Pettis Perry]] and [[Al Richmond]].

From 1962 to 1972 Allen headed [[International Publishers]], the American Communist Party's publishing house. He later served as American editor of the 50-volume ''Marx-Engels Collected Works'' project, a joint publishing project between International Publishers, [[Lawrence and Wishart]] in the United Kingdom, and [[Progress Publishers]] in Moscow.

James S. Allen died in 1986.
