==History==
The Robie House was designed by [[Frank Lloyd Wright]] in 1908, in his [[Frank Lloyd Wright Home and Studio|Oak Park Studio]].<ref name=wright>[http://www.wrightplus.org/robiehouse/robiehouse.html Robie House], Frank Lloyd Wright Preservation Trust, Retrieved January 26, 2007.</ref>  The contractor for the project, H.B. Barnard Co. of [[Chicago]] began construction on April 15, 1909. The home's construction, however was largely complete in May 1910. Even after 1910 a few minor additions and finishing touches were performed on the building. The last work on the home was completed by January 1911.

==Architecture==
The Robie House is one of the best known early examples of [[Prairie style]] architecture, a style Wright helped create and popularize.

The exterior walls are constructed of a red-orange brick. The capstones, lintels, sills and other exterior features are of a light gray stone, similar to sandstone. The fireplaces and chimneys of the Robie House utilize no firebrick in the fireplace interiors and are constructed of the same brick as the exterior.<ref name=habs/>

It is one of Wright's earlier works and one of the very earliest examples of Prairie style.<ref name=habs>[http://memory.loc.gov/ammem/collections/habs_haer/placeI.html Illinois Places], Frederick C. Robie House, Data Pages, Historic American Buildings Survey, Library of Congress. Retrieved January 26, 2007.</ref> According to the Historical American Buildings Survey, the city of Chicago's Commission on Chicago Architectural Landmarks stated: "The bold interplay of horizontal planes about the chimney mass, and the structurally expressive piers and windows, established a new form of domestic design."<ref name=habs/>

==The house today==
As of [[2007]], it serves as a museum operated by the Frank Lloyd Wright Preservation Trust, after having undergone renovations beginning in 2001. Previously, it was a gathering place for Chicago alumni.  The house is famous for its art glass windows, which dapple the house with color and light.
