'''Vernon W. Hill II''' (born August 18, 1945) is an American businessman, the founder and chairman of [[Metro Bank (UK)|Metro Bank]], a UK retail bank with 15 branches, and assets of <U+00A3>800m ($1.3bn). He is also the founder, former Chairman, President and CEO of [[Commerce Bancorp]] of [[Cherry Hill, New Jersey]] and Chairman of Fetch Inc (aka Pet Plan North America).

==Early career==
Although known for banking, Hill<U+2019>s business outlook has been informed by early encounters with retailing. While taking morning classes at Wharton, Hill worked afternoons at a [[South Jersey]] bank owned by a local car retailer, where Hill observed the car dealer applying retail principles to banking operations, such as late opening hours. The job also brought Hill into contact with other local retailers, including [[McDonald's]].<ref name="Vernon the Barbarian">{{cite web|title=Vernon the Barbarian|url=http://www.phillymag.com/articles/vernon-the-barbarian/|publisher=Philadelphia Magazine|accessdate=28 August 2012|date=August 2001|year=2001}}</ref> After graduation Hill founded a real estate firm to find and develop sites for McDonalds, a task which required Hill to drive McDonald's entrepreneur [[Ray Kroc]] on scouting trips. Hill claims his experience with McDonald<U+2019>s taught him the importance of standardised presentation and scale economies in retailing.<ref>{{cite web|last=Tully|first=Shawn|title=Vernon Hill is the best damn banker alive (Just ask him)|url=http://finance.fortune.cnn.com/2010/09/15/vernon-hill-is-the-best-damn-banker-alive-just-ask-him/|work=Fortune Magazine|publisher=CNN|accessdate=11 October 2012|quote=I was fascinated at how McDonald's created the same look and same experience in every location," says Hill. "I also learned that costs are relatively fixed, so it's all about volume."}}</ref> 

''Philadelphia Magazine'' reports that Hill<U+2019>s experience with McDonald<U+2019>s led directly to the creation of Commerce Bank. Referring to the creation of Commerce, Morton Kerr, Chairman of the board of Markeim-Chalmers, Inc., a South Jersey real estate firm, and one of the original Commerce board members, observed:

<blockquote> <U+201C>A lot of us knew Vernon from being involved in real estate at that time<U+2026>He was a 26-year-old kid who called about 15 of us to a meeting in his office. I'll never forget it. He said, 'We're going to start a bank.' And he said we'd each have to put up between $250,000 and $500,000. This was 1973-who had that kind of money? But he'd arranged for all of us to borrow it. If you could put up $100,000, he got us loans for $400,000. Only seven of us didn't get up and walk out, but we still thought he was crazy.<U+201D><ref name="Vernon the Barbarian"/> </blockquote>

The deal resulted in Commerce opening its first branch in [[Marlton, New Jersey]], in 1973.

==Commerce Bancorp==
Commerce Bank was notable for its rapid expansion, from one branch in 1973 to 470 branches in 2008, and a deposit base that grew by an average of 30% per year between 1996 and 2001 (against an industry average of 5% in 2001). According to ''Forbes Magazine'', Commerce produced a 23% annual shareholder return compounded for 30 years.<ref name="Murphy 2007">{{cite web|last=Murphy|first=Andrea|title=Chiefs In The 20-20-20 Club|url=http://www.forbes.com/2007/05/09/returns-ceos-salaries-pf-ii-in_am_0509sf.html|publisher=Forbes|accessdate=28 August 2012|year=2007|quote=It's no easy feat to make it onto our 20-20-20 list. A chief executive has to have held the top job for at least 20 years--at a company with publicly traded shares for at least 20 years--and have presided over at least a 20% annual return in share price during his or her tenure.}}</ref>

Commerce Bank<U+2019>s economic model rested on the idea that the fixed costs of a bank branch are largely independent of volume, and so profitability lay in maximizing the number of deposits and accounts per branch. Additionally, Hill believed that the industry's reliance on internet banking had led to dis-investment in bank branches, to the detriment of consumers who prioritised in-person service.

<blockquote> <U+201C>Other banks decided to push consumers out of the branch because it is the high-cost delivery channel.  They wanted to push them online.  We totally reject that.  You can<U+2019>t name me one retailer in this country that has pushed people where they don<U+2019>t want to go and succeeded<U+2026>We have some branches that get 100,000 customer visits a month; the average branch gets 40,000.  An average McDonald<U+2019>s gets 25,000 per month.<U+201D><ref>{{cite web|last=Frei|first=Frances|title=Commerce Bank|work=9-603-080|publisher=Harvard Business Review|accessdate=28 August 2012|page=4}}</ref></blockquote>  

Hill<U+2019>s motto for Commerce was <U+201C>America<U+2019>s most convenient bank<U+201D>.<ref>{{cite web|title=Wharton Alumni Magazine: 125 Influential People and Ideas: Vernon W. Hill II|url=http://www.wharton.upenn.edu/125anniversaryissue/hill.html|publisher=Wharton}}</ref>

Commerce tactics were oriented to drive volume, differentiation and customer advocacy, including:

* Longer opening hours, including evenings and weekends; opening ten minutes earlier and later than advertised hours
* Removing glass from teller booths for a more open customer experience
* Pet-friendly policies
* Giveaways such as lollipops and dog biscuits
* Free use of coin-counting machines
* Handing out pens in response to rival banks<U+2019> practice of chaining pens to desks
* <U+201C>Kill the stupid rule<U+201D> program, whereby employees who suggested an alternative to a stupid rule were paid $50

Commerce bank staff were awarded $5,000 if a nearby rival bank closed its branches; hundreds of mystery shoppers made tens of thousands of store visits annually, and salary increases were based on mystery shopping scores. Top-performing managers were given sports cars.<ref>{{cite web|title=Commerce Minus Larger Than Life Entrepreneur|url=http://www.financialpost.com/scripts/story.html?id=9099a9a5-65c0-47f4-ab09-9e9449314811&k=65145&p=1|publisher=Financial Post|accessdate=28 August 2012}}</ref>

On June 29, 2007, Hill resigned as Chairman and CEO of Commerce Bancorp after the [[Office of the Comptroller of the Currency]], the [[Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia]] and the board of directors of Commerce Bancorp established governance to stop doing business with firms under the control of Hill<U+2019>s family. Notable business dealings with insiders included property leases with entities in which Hill was a partner, and the purchase of services from an architectural design business run by his wife, Shirley.[http://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/RTGAM.20071002.wvernon1002/BNStory/Front] No charges were brought.

On October 2, 2007, Commerce Bancorp announced that it would be merging with TD Bank Financial Group. The Canadian-based [[Toronto-Dominion Bank]] would acquire Commerce for $8.5 billion (U.S. dollars) in cash and stock, at $42 per share of CBH stock, a purchase multiple of x28. Some industry commentators held that Hill's departure and a strong Canadian dollar had made a takeover inevitable.

==PetPlan==
Hill is Chairman of Fetch Inc. (aka PetPlan North America), a pet health insurance company founded by Chris and Natasha Ashton. It holds the U.S. franchise from [[Petplan]] of Britain, the world's biggest provider of policies for companion animals. Hill invested in the company in April 2008, believing pet health to be a growth market in the USA.<ref>{{cite web|last=Benner|first=Katie|title=A health care plan for Fido|url=http://management.fortune.cnn.com/2011/10/31/petplan-pet-insurance/|publisher=Fortune Magazine|accessdate=28 August 2012|date=October 31, 2011}}</ref> 

Speaking to ''[[Fortune Magazine]]'' in 2010, Hill said:
<blockquote>"People used to put down their pets when they got sick. Now they're members of the family. People will want to save them with kidney transplants and hip replacements. This business will be huge."</blockquote>

Hill often travels with his [[Yorkshire Terrier]], Duffy.

==Metro Bank==
Metro Bank UK was launched in London July 2010, with Hill as co-founder and vice-chairman and co-founder [[Metro Bank (UK)|Anthony Thomson]] as Chairman. 

Press commentary at the time centred on Metro being the first high-street bank to open in the United Kingdom for more than 100 years, and upon Hill's belief that the competitive landscape of British banking amounted to a commercial opportunity to lead on service rather than price. In 2010, 85% of the UK market for current accounts was held by the <U+201C>big five<U+201D> banking institutions ([[HSBC]], [[Barclay's]], [[Royal Bank of Scotland]], [[Grupo Santander|Santander]] and [[Lloyd's]]).<ref>{{cite web|last=Moore|first=Elaine|title=Challengers needed<U+2019> for big five banks|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/d5d886ac-c9cb-11e1-bf00-00144feabdc0.html#axzz24qPIPe1W|publisher=Financial Times|accessdate=28 August 2012}}</ref> In 2008 an official report from the Office of Fair Trading concluded that UK banking was subject to weak competitive pressures and profit-maximising strategies.<ref>{{cite web|title=Personal current account market not working well for consumers, says OFT|url=http://www.oft.gov.uk/news-and-updates/press/2008/84-08|publisher=Office of Fair Trading|accessdate=28 August 2012|date=July 2008}}</ref> Forbes Magazine described Metro at launch as "...aiming to disrupt a storied industry dominated by a handful of established players".<ref>{{cite web|last=Olson|first=Parmy|title=Vernon Hill Beefs Up 'Whopper Banking' In London|url=http://www.forbes.com/2010/11/03/metro-bank-uk-markets-equities-vernon-hill-london-investment.html|publisher=Forbes.com|accessdate=21 August 2012|date=11th|month=March|year=2010|quote=Having opened his first British store last July in Holborn, London, Hill has come to Britain with a similar mandate to offer customers good service over good interest rates, and promising "no stupid bank rules."}}</ref>

In an April 2011 speech to the Financial Services Club in London, Hill commented on market research into approval ratings for UK banks, in particular the finding that [[Lloyds TSB]] and Barclay's banks had negative [[net promoter]] scores overall:

<blockquote> "If I was Lloyds or Barclays, I would climb under the table seeing these numbers. I've never seen negative net promoter numbers before in my life.  I don't even know how you can get negative net promoter numbers.  What are you doing?"<ref>{{cite web|title=Vernon Hill on Metro Bank|url=http://www.hedgehogs.net/pg/blog/skinnercm/read/8037263/vernon-hill-on-metro-bank|publisher=Hedgehogs.net|accessdate=28 August 2012|date=August 2012}}</ref> </blockquote>

In a [[BBC News]] interview, Thomson commented that the cost<U+2013>driven model of traditional British banks required them to discourage customers from visiting branches, whereas Metro Bank<U+2019>s model actively sought to attract customers into branches, using tactics such as longer opening hours and pet-friendly policies.<ref>{{cite web|title=Metro Bank opens doors in UK|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-10790996|publisher=BBC.co.uk|accessdate=21 August 2012|quote=Metro Bank hopes to gain customers dissatisfied with their existing banks.}}</ref> 

The pair spent a further two years securing a <U+00A3>75m launch investment, including funds from New York real estate developer Richard LeFrak, property investors the Reuben brothers and Fidelity, the fund management company.<ref>{{cite web|last=Bates|first=Victoria|title=Metro Bank taps investors for <U+00A3>45m to speed up expansion|url=http://www.cityam.com/news-and-analysis/metro-bank-taps-investors-%C2%A345m-speed-expansion|publisher=City A.M.|accessdate=21 August 2012|date=1st|month=November|year=2010}}</ref>  Metro launched with plans to open 200 branches in London by 2020.<ref>{{cite web|last=Baird|first=Roger|title=The late-night bank manager is planning a High Street revolution|url=http://www.cityam.com/news-and-analysis/the-late-night-bank-manager-planning-high-street-revolution|publisher=City A.M.|accessdate=21 August 2012|date=9th|month=August|year=2010|quote=Metro Bank plans to open another three branches in Earl<U+2019>s Court, Fulham Broadway and Borehamwood by the end of the year, and eight more next year.

In June 2012 the company announced the completion of a <U+00A3>126m round of capital-raising to open further branches in London, including funds from Moore Capital and billionaire investor Steve Cohen.<ref>{{cite web|last=Dunne|first=John|title=Metro Bank eyes expansion after raising <U+00A3>50m|url=http://www.cityam.com/news-and-analysis/metro-bank-eyes-expansion-after-raising-%C2%A350m-new-capital|publisher=City A.M.|accessdate=21 August 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Edwards|first=Peter|title=Float looms for growing Metro|url=http://www.cityam.com/latest-news/float-looms-growing-metro|publisher=City A.M.|accessdate=21 August 2012|date=11th|month=June|year=2012}}</ref>

Noted investor Wilbur Ross commented that "The question is whether [Hill<U+2019>s] promotional flair and service concept will produce enough customers to offset the extra operational cost of providing the extra space".<ref>{{cite web|title=Metro Bank opens doors in UK|url= http://www.philly.com/philly/blogs/inq-phillydeals/99510414.html |quote= Wilbur Ross on Vernon Hill's new UK bank, and his own}}</ref>

==Other investments==
Hill is a partner with Steve Lewis in US Restaurants Inc, which operates 40 Burger King restaurants in metropolitan Philadelphia.<ref>{{cite web|title=A Little Bit about Us|url=http://www.usrestaurantsinc.com/who.html|publisher=US Restaurants|accessdate=14 September 2012}}</ref>

Hill's first business was Site Development Inc, a real estate development firm which has developed over 1000 shopping centres and retail developments in America.<ref>{{cite web|title=Executive team|url=http://www.ic-re.com/about/executive-team.asp|accessdate=28 August 2012}}</ref>

In 1994, Hill along with partners John Silvestri and Steve Lewis founded and developed Galloway National Golf Club near Atlantic City, New Jersey. The course was designed by Tom Fazio and is ranked by GolfDigest.com as being among the top 100 courses in America.

He is Chairman of the executive committee of fresh salad restaurant chain [[Saladworks]], operating in 150 locations.

==Business philosophy==
''Fortune Magazine'' describes Hill as a <U+201C>...flamboyant, tradition-stomping American billionaire<U+2026>the [[P.T. Barnum]] of banking<U+201D>.<ref>{{cite web|last=Tully|first=Shawn|title=Vernon Hill is the best damn banker alive (Just ask him)|url=http://finance.fortune.cnn.com/2010/09/15/vernon-hill-is-the-best-damn-banker-alive-just-ask-him/|publisher=Forbes|year=2010}}</ref> 

Hill has often advocated a business development strategy based on organic growth rather than [[Mergers and acquisitions|acquisition]], and by generating [[Loyalty marketing|customer loyalty]] through service rather than price. Speaking to a 2010 [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] [[Treasury Select Committee]] on [[Competition (economics)|competition]] and choice in the banking sector, Hill said:

<blockquote> <U+201C>My opinion is that great retailers never grow by acquisition<U+2026>If you see yourself as a retailer delivering an unusual service, acquisitions are the easiest way to kill your model<U+2026>[Organic growth] is slower, but you get what you want at the end. You get a group of people running your model, not somebody else<U+2019>s model<U+2026>.<U+201D><ref>{{cite web|title=TREASURY COMMITTEE  COMPETITION AND CHOICE IN THE BANKING SECTOR|url=http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201011/cmselect/cmtreasy/uc612-v/uc61201.htm|publisher=Hansard|accessdate=28 August 2012}}</ref> </blockquote>

Hill is a critic of the [[shadow banking system]], believing it to largely responsible for the [[2007-2012 global financial crisis]].

<blockquote> <U+201C>We have two American banking systems. We have the normal banking system, with 8,000 banks serving consumers and businesses throughout America. Then we developed a shadow banking system<U+2026>the money market funds, the investment banks, the credit default swaps. The current crisis is really a crisis of this shadow banking system<U+2026>.I think when [banks] are making a loan to, say, a restaurant, the overwhelming majority of banks aren<U+2019>t playing games. As long as the guy<U+2019>s paying, it<U+2019>s a loan that pays back over time. Then we moved into all this exotic stuff <U+2014> [[credit default swaps]], [[Collateralized debt obligation|CDOs]]. Believe me, no one at [[Goldman Sachs]] understands what they have on their books, because these kids are sitting at their computers dreaming this stuff up<U+2026>.<U+201D><ref>{{cite web|title=This Too Shall Pass|url=http://www.phillymag.com/articles/the-economy-this-too-shall-pass/2/|publisher=Philadelphia Magazine|accessdate=28 August 2012}}</ref> </blockquote>

Hill is often quoted as viewing his banks to be in the retail business rather than the banking business.

<blockquote> <U+201C>You don't have to think about what time a [[Home Depot]], a [[McDonald's]] or a [[Starbucks]] is open,<U+201D> Hill says. <U+201C>They're open. You just go. My theory was, if you advertise that [your bank is] open on Sunday, the consumer will automatically believe you're open all the time. That message is more important than the savings." </blockquote>

In its 2007 20-20-20 Club, ''Forbes Magazine'' lists Hill as one of seven CEOs (along with [[Warren Buffet]] and [[Larry Ellison]]) of publicly traded companies with tenures of over 20 years to deliver an annual shareholder return in excess of 20%. Commerce produced a 23% annual compounded shareholder return over that time.<ref name="Murphy 2007"/>

==Personal life==
Hill is the son of a Virginia real estate brokerage owner and the eldest of six children. He graduated from [[Wharton School]] of the [[University of Pennsylvania]] in Philadelphia in 1967, earning a BS in economics with a concentration in finance.

Hill's 46,000&nbsp;ft<U+00B2> (4,270 m<U+00B2>) mansion Villa Collina, located in [[Moorestown Township, New Jersey]] is said to be the largest private residence in the state.<ref>Smith, Eileen and Walsh, Jim.
