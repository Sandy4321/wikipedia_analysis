'''USS ''Kentucky'' (BB-66)''' was to be the sixth and final {{sclass|Iowa|battleship}} constructed for the [[United States Navy]]; she was the second ship to be [[ship naming and launching|named]] in honor of [[Kentucky|the 15th state]]. Like her sister ship {{USS|Illinois|BB-65}}, ''Kentucky'' was still under construction at the end of [[World War II]] and was caught up in the post-war drawdown of the armed services. Her construction was suspended twice, during which times she served as a spare parts cache of sorts, until being sold for scrap in 1958 after several failed attempts to have her completed as a guided missile battleship.

==Background==
{{main|Iowa class battleship}}
''Kentucky'' was one of the "[[fast battleship]]" designs planned in 1938 by the Preliminary Design Branch at the [[Bureau of Construction and Repair]]. She was to be the fifth of the six authorized ships of the {{sclass|Iowa|battleship|4}} of [[battleship]]s. Her [[keel]] was laid down at the [[Norfolk Navy Yard]], [[Portsmouth, Virginia]] on [[6 December]] [[1944]]. Like ''Illinois'', ''Kentucky'' differed from her earlier sisters in that her design called for an all welded construction. This would have saved weight and increased strength over a combination riveted/welded hull of the type used on the four completed ''Iowa''-class ships. There was thought of redesigning the hull with {{sclass|Montana|battleship|0}} type armor for added [[torpedo]] protection; however, this was rejected and ''Kentucky'' was being built along the regular ''Iowa'' class hull design.<ref name="math">{{cite web |url=http://web.umr.edu/~rogersda/american&military_history/World%27s%20Fastest%20Battleships.pdf |title=Development of the World's Fastest Battleships |accessdate=2007-04-28 |format=pdf |last=Rogers |first=J. David}}</ref> 

Like her ''Iowa''-class sisters, ''Kentucky''<U+2019>s construction began in response to the need for fast escorts for the {{sclass|Essex|aircraft carrier}}s. She was conceived in 1935, when the United States Navy initiated design studies for the creation of an extended [[South Dakota class battleship (1939)|''South Dakota'' class]] that was not restricted by the [[Second London Naval Treaty]]. The latter four ''Iowa'' class battleships (''Missouri'', ''Wisconsin'', ''Illinois'' and ''Kentucky'') were not cleared for construction until 1940,<ref name="math"/> and at the time ''Illinois'' and ''Kentucky'' were to be larger, slower battleship mounting twelve 16&nbsp;inch Mark 7 guns.<ref name="Mark 7">{{cite web | last =DiGiulian | first =Tony | title =United States of America 16"/50 (40.6 cm) Mark 7 | work = Unofficial U.S. Navy site | date = Last updated [[12 November]] [[2006]] | url =http://www.navweaps.com/Weapons/WNUS_16-50_mk7.htm | accessdate =2007-01-16}}</ref><ref> This was not the first time that changes to the ''Iowa'' class had been proposed: at the time the battleships were cleared for construction some policymakers were not sold on the U.S. need for more battleships, and proposed turning the ''Iowa''-class ships into aircraft carriers by retaining the hull design but switching their decks to carry and handle aircraft (This had already been done on the battlecruisers {{USS|Lexington|CV-2|2}} and {{USS|Saratoga|CV-3|2). This proposal was countered by [[Admiral]] [[Ernest King]], the Chief of Naval Operations.{{cite web | title =BB-61 Iowa-class Aviation Conversion | url =http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/systems/ship/bb-61-av.htm | accessdate =2007-05-19}}</ref>  By late 1939, it had become apparent that the navy needed as many [[fast battleship]]s as possible and it was decided that BB-65 and BB-66 would follow the same design as their sisters.<ref>At the time, the {{sclass|Montana|battleship|4}} was planned to begin with hull number BB-65, rather than BB-67 as it became after two more ''Iowa''s were ordered as BB-65 and BB-66. {{cite web | title =Iowa Class (BB-61 through BB-66) Drawings | url =http://www.history.navy.mil/photos/usnshtp/bb/bb61cl-d.htm | accessdate =2007-11-07}}</ref><ref> It is possible that the design originally intended for BB-65 and BB-66 was to be implemented in the {{sclass|Montana|battleship}}s. The ''Montanas'' would have had twelve 16 inch guns and heavier armor and were intended to have a slower top speed than the ''Iowa''-class.</ref>

==Construction==
{{main|Iowa class battleship|Armament of the Iowa class battleship}}
''Kentucky''<U+2019>s main battery would have consisted of nine [[16 inch (406 mm)/50 caliber Mark 7 naval gun]]s, which could hurl 2,700 lb armor piercing shells some {{convert|24|mi|km|0}}. Her secondary battery would have consisted of ten [[5 inch (127 mm)/38 caliber gun]]s, which could fire at targets up to {{convert|9|mi|km|0}} away. With the advent of air power and the need to gain and maintain [[air superiority]] came a need to protect the growing fleet of allied aircraft carriers; to this end, ''Kentucky'' was to be fitted with an array of [[Oerlikon 20 mm cannon|Oerlikon 20 mm]] and [[Bofors 40 mm gun|Bofors 40 mm]] [[anti-aircraft artillery|anti-aircraft guns]] to defend allied carriers from enemy airstrikes.<ref name="The Battleships I">{{cite book  | last =Johnston, Ian & McAuley, Rob  | title =The Battleships | publisher =Channel 4 Books (an imprint of Pan Macmillian, LTD) | date =2002 | location =London | pages =page 120 | url = http://www.panmacmillan.com/ | id =ISBN 0752261886}}</ref><ref name="Discovery">{{cite episode | title = The 10 Greatest Fighting Ships in Military History | network = The Discover Channel}}</ref>

''Kentucky''<U+2019>s construction was plagued by suspensions; the first came on [[6 June]] [[1942]] when ''Kentucky'' was suspended and her keel floated out of the builder's way to make room for construction of a higher priority ship. ''Kentucky''<U+2019>s construction resumed on [[6 December]] [[1944]] with a new keel laying, but construction of the battleship was suspended again on [[17 February]] [[1947]]. Her construction resumed once again on [[17 August]] [[1948]], and continued until her cancellation on [[20 January]] [[1950]], at which time she was floated out of her drydock to clear a space for repairs to sister ship {{USS|Missouri|BB-63|2}}, which had run aground en route from [[Hampton Roads]].<ref name="oops">{{cite web | title = USS Missouri (BB-63) (subsection: Accidents aboard USS MISSOURI) | work = Unofficial U.S. Navy site | url = http://www.navysite.de/bb/bb63.htm |publisher=Thoralf Doehring |accessdate=2006-12-15}}</ref><ref name="DANFS">{{cite web | title = USS Missouri (BB 63) History | url = http://www.history.navy.mil/danfs/m12/missouri-iv.htm | work = [[Dictionary of American Naval Fighting Ships]] | publisher= [[United States Navy]] | accessdate=2006-12-15}}</ref>

==Fate==
[[Image:USS Kentucky (BBG-1) concept artwork.jpg|thumb|left|Concept artwork of what ''Kentucky'' may have looked like had she been completed as a guided missile battleship]]
''Kentucky'' was never completed, instead serving as a supply cache of sorts while in the [[United States Navy reserve fleets|mothball fleet]] at the [[Philadelphia Naval Shipyard]] from about 1950 to 1958.<ref name="math"/> It was during this time that several plans were proposed to complete ''Kentucky'' as a guided missile battleship (BBG) by removing the aft turret and installing a missile system.

({{cite web | title = USS Mississippi (BB 41) History | url = http://www.history.navy.mil/danfs/m12/mississippi-iii.htm | work = [[Dictionary of American Naval Fighting Ships]]|publisher= [[United States Navy]] | accessdate=2007-11-07}})</ref><ref>More recently, this was done to the four completed ''Iowa''-class battleships to allow them to carry and launch [[BGM-109 Tomahawk|BGM-109 Tomahawk Missile]]s and [[Boeing Harpoon|RGM-84 Harpoon Missile]]s.

In May or June 1956, ''Kentucky<U+2019>s'' [[bow (ship)|bow]] was removed and transported on a large crane barge from [[Newport News, Virginia]], where she had been towed, back to [[Norfolk Naval Shipyard]], to be used in the repair of {{USS|Wisconsin|BB-64}}, which had been damaged in a collision with {{USS|Eaton|DDE-510}} on [[6 May]] [[1956]].<ref name="math"/> A new bow was fabricated but never installed; it was stored on her deck until the hulk was towed away.<ref>[http://www.hazegray.org/navhist/battleships/us_wwii.htm hazegray.org] USS Kentucky (BB-66) Accessed 2007-11-03</ref>

When {{USS|Sacramento|AOE-1|2}} and {{USS|Camden|AOE-2|2}}, the first two of the {{sclass|Sacramento|fast combat support ship}}s, were laid down in 1961 and 1964, the Navy turned to ''Kentucky''<U+2019>s four turbine sets to power the ships. This would later prove to be a beneficial move: when the Navy switched from 600 psi boilers to 1,200 psi (4.1 to 8.3 MPa) boilers, sailors who had served aboard these ''Sacramentos'' were called upon to operate the older boilers aboard {{USS|New Jersey|BB-62}} during her combat tour in the [[Vietnam War]] and aboard all four of the ''Iowas'' when recalled and modernized in the 1980s as part of the 600-ship Navy plan.<ref name="math"/>

''Kentucky'' was struck from the [[Naval Vessel Register]] on [[9 June]] [[1958]] and her incomplete hulk was sold for scrapping to Boston Metals Company of [[Baltimore, Maryland]], on [[31 October]].<ref name="Kentucky I">{{cite web | title = USS Kentucky (BB 66) History | url = http://www.history.navy.mil/danfs/k3/kentucky.htm | work = [[Dictionary of American Naval Fighting Ships]]|publisher= [[United States Navy]] | accessdate=2006-01-17}}</ref><ref name="Kentucky II"/>  ''Kentucky'' was the second-to-last battleship under construction by the US Navy,<ref name="Illinois">{{cite web | title = Naval Vessel Register | url = http://www.nvr.navy.mil/nvrships/details/BB65.htm | work = |publisher= [[United States Navy]] | accessdate=2000-11-03}}</ref> and holds the title of being the highest numbered battleship hull to have been under construction but not completed for the United States Navy. {{USS|Wisconsin|BB-64}} is numerically the highest numbered US battleship built, although she was actually completed before {{USS|Missouri|BB-63}}, making ''Missouri'' the last completed US battleship.<ref name="Kentucky I"/><ref name="63 64 compare">''Wisconsin'' was commissioned [[April 16]] [[1944]][http://www.nvr.navy.mil/nvrships/details/BB64.htm] while USS ''Missouri'' was commissioned [[June 11]] [[1944]][http://www.nvr.navy.mil/nvrships/details/BB63.htm]</ref>
