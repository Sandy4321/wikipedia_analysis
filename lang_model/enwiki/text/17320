Also Known As: '''''CCV <U+2014> Channel Catfish Viral Disease <U+2014> CCVD'''''

==Introduction==
'''Channel Catfish virus''' (Ictalurid herpesvirus 1) is a member of the ''Alloherpesviridae'' family that causes disease in [[catfish]].<ref name="pmid9499043">{{cite journal |author=Huang S, Hanson LA |title=Temporal gene regulation of the channel catfish virus (Ictalurid herpesvirus 1) |journal=Journal of Virology |volume=72 |issue=3 |pages=1910<U+2013>7 |year=1998 |month=March |pmid=9499043 |pmc=109482 |doi= |url=http://jvi.asm.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=9499043}}</ref>  Infection with Channel catfish viral disease (CCVD) can cause significant economic loss in channel catfish farms. The disease is endemic in the USA and there are reports of the virus in Honduras and Russia. Transmission is both horizontal and vertical. Disease occurs in fish less than a year old that weigh less than 10&nbsp;grams, and the critical environmental factor is water temperature, with disease occurring during warm weather. [[Channel catfish]] and [[blue catfish]] are the only fish that are susceptible to CCVD and outbreaks are normally seen in [[fish farming|farmed fish]]. Reservoirs of disease are clinically affected fish and recovered covert carriers.<ref name = "wikivet">[http://en.wikivet.net/Channel_Catfish_Virus '''Channel Catfish Virus''', reviewed and published by Wikivet accessed 18/08/2011]</ref>

==Clinical Signs & Diagnosis==	
Affected fish have pot-bellied appearance, haemorrhages on the fins and musculature and [[exopthalmos]]. Affected fish seem off balance and tend to swim erratically or close to the surface, eventually sinking to the bottom. 

Fish that survive the infection have lifelong protective [[immunity]] but remain latent carriers of CCV. This is a significant source of disease for vulnerable fish. 

Increased mortality in young catfish during warm weather, especially after stress is suggestive of CCVD. 

CCV can be detected in water containing infected fish and organs of diseased fish by virus neutralisation, [[Direct fluorescent antibody|fluorescent antibody testing]], [[ELISA]] or [[PCR]]. FAT and ELISA should be used for diagnosis of clinically infected fish while virus neutralisation or PCR should be used to to detect carrier fish. Lesions are seen on the [[liver]], [[kidney]] and many other internal organs both histologically and grossly on [[autopsy|postmortem examination]].<ref name = "wikivet"/>

==Treatment & Control==
There is no available treatment. Stress and high stocking-densities should be avoided to reduce disease occurence. Appropriate [[quarantine]] and hygiene measures should be employed to prevent spread of disease. The virus is sensitive to acidic [[pH]], heat and UV light and is inactivated by pond mud and sea water.<ref name = "wikivet"/>
