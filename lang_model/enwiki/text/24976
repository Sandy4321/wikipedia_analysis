{{nihongo|'''Victreebel'''|<U+30A6><U+30C4><U+30DC><U+30C3><U+30C8>|Utsubotto|Utsubot}}, one of {{pokenum}} fictional species from the ''[[Pok<U+00E9>mon]]'' franchise, is a [[Pok<U+00E9>mon types#Grass and Poison|Grass- and Poison-type]] Pok<U+00E9>mon. The name Victreebel may be a combination of "[[victory]]" and "[[bell (instrument)|bell]]."  The "bell" refers to the shape of the Pokemon's head, similarly to its pre-evolved forms [[Bellsprout]] and [[Weepinbell]]. It is also worth noting that it contains the word "[[tree]]" within it, as Victreebel is a grass-type Pok<U+00E9>mon.  It may also be derived from "big tree bell".  It may be of interest to know that its Japanese name "Utsubot" is probably inspired by the word "utsubokazura", the Japanese word for the pitcher plant.  It is speculated that the full spelling should be "Victreebell" in keeping with the names of its pre-evolved forms.  However, the limit of letters to a Pok<U+00E9>mon species' name is 10, as dictated by the code to any Pok<U+00E9>mon game, so one "l" was discarded.

== Biology ==

Victreebel looks like an elongated Weepinbell; however, its mouth is now at the top of its body as opposed to the bottom. Its mouth now has two small fangs, and a leaf covering it so that it can open and shut. Its vine, as mentioned above, grows from this leaf. Victreebel is based on [[pitcher plants]].

Victreebel is said to live in huge colonies deep in the jungle, although nobody has ever returned  from these places to confirm. It lulls its prey with a sweet, honey-like scent, and also the vine on its head (which waves as if it was an animal) before digesting it with powerful stomach acids that can even dissolve bone. Normally, its prey are bugs, but it has been known to attack and consume small animals.

== In the Pok<U+00E9>mon video games ==

Victreebel must be evolved from a Weepinbell by using a Leaf Stone. It cannot be obtained in [[Pok<U+00E9>mon Red]] through any other method other than using a hacking device or trading.

Victreebel can be compared to [[Venusaur]] in both movepool and statistics, in which case Victreebel exchanges defense and special defense stats for a higher attack stat, which would work nicely with its Sludge Bomb attack that can be taught by Technical Machine, just as its equally high special attack would go with its Razor Leaf move, and Solarbeam as well. In [[Pok<U+00E9>mon FireRed and LeafGreen]], Victreebel also has access to the Stockpile/Spit Up/Swallow set of moves. However, Victreebel is also somewhat inferior to Venusaur in terms of speed, which taken together with its lower defenses make Victreebel a fair bit less desirable than Venusaur, especially considering that Pok<U+00E9>mon<U+2019>s access to the very powerful Frenzy Plant move.

Victreebel does have the Chlorophyll ability, however, which doubles its speed in sunlight, so it appears in competitive play as a Pok<U+00E9>mon that operates with a team based on the Sunny Day move (or [[Groudon]]<U+2019>s Drought). If brought out under the influence of sunlight, Victreebel proves to be a swift and powerful Grass/Poison-type force that can launch repeated Solarbeam (which is upgraded in sunlight) and [[Sludge]] Bomb attacks that are strengthened by both Victreebel<U+2019>s high offensive statistics and the Same-Type Attack Bonuses that result from Victreebel<U+2019>s types.

A Victreebel can also be found in the [[Nintendo 64]] game [[Pok<U+00E9>mon Snap]] in the Cave Course. A lone Weepinbell will be circling around a small puddle of water, and if it is knocked into the pond by Pok<U+00E9>mon food or a Pester Ball, it will evolve into a Victreebel, which can then be photographed.

== Anime appearances ==

James, of Team Rocket, had a Victreebel. It was evolved from his Weepinbell while in a daycare center (run by Butch and Cassidy). Far from being loyal to him, however, it usually tried to eat him as soon as it emerged from its [[Pok<U+00E9> ball]] (this tradition was continued by James' [[Cacnea]] in the "advanced generation" of the [[Pok<U+00E9>mon (anime)|anime]]). It was known for emitting a high-pitched shriek when it emerged from its ball.

In "Here's Lookin' at you Elekid", James traded his Victreebel for a Weepinbell from the Magikarp Salesman that he claimed could attract other Pok<U+00E9>mon with its scent. But soon after that one evolved into Victreebel, it immediately tried to devour Jessie. In a rage, Jessie threw it away, much to James' horror. At the same time, James' first Victreebel tried to eat the Magikarp Salesman, so he threw it away as well. The two Victreebel crashed into each other in mid-air, fell in love, and left James.
