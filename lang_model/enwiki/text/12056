'''Davor Domazet -"Lo<U+0161>o"''' (1948) is a [[Croatia]]n writer, politician and former army leader.

Domazet was born in [[Sinj]]. He graduated from all the [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslav]] army schools, including the Military Academy, and started his military career in the [[JNA]] Navy. 

As a Croatian patriot, Domazet (then a captain) defected to the [[Croatian Army]] in autumn 1991. He became actively involved in military operations and organized the military intelligence services. In 1992, he and [[Ante Gotovina]] were the chief commanders of the [[Livno]] front and the large area of military operations covering the northern and central [[Dalmatia]], southern [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]]. His biggest strategic successes include the planning of major operations in Croatia and Bosnia ([[Operation Flash]], [[Operation Storm]], [[Operation South Move]]) and the fight against enemy intelligence, as well as the incursions into the enemy camp (the most spectacular being the wiretapping of [[Slobodan Milo<U+0161>evi<U+0107>]] in his Belgrade headquarters). 

He continued his career in the Croatian Army, becoming a [[rear admiral]] and finally an [[admiral]] in 2000. He was the head of the Office for Strategic Research (1991), the head of the Intelligence Service of the Croatian Army Headquarters (1992), the Deputy Chief of Staff and the Chief of Staff (1998-2000). He was forced into retirement in 2000, after he and some other generals signed a protest note accusing the Croatian president [[Stjepan Mesi<U+0107>]] of participating in the attempt to denigrate and criminalize the [[Croatian War of Independence]]. Then he became one of the leaders of a political party, [[True Croatian Revival]] (HIP).

Ever since his days in JNA, Domazet has been publishing numerous expert articles on the issues of war, navy and submarines. He is a prominent military analyst in the area of [[geostrategy]]. His most important work in that area is ''Hrvatska i veliko rati<U+0161>te'' (Croatia and the Large Front, 2002). He published his last two books, ''Gospodari kaosa'' (Masters of Chaos), in 2005 and ''Klonovi nastupaju'' (Clones perform), in 2007.
