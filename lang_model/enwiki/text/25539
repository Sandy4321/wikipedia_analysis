'''St Margaret-at-Cliffe''' is a three part [[village]] situated just off the coast road between [[Deal, Kent|Deal]] and [[Dover]] in [[Kent]], [[England]]. The heart of the village is about two [[mile]]s from the sea with the residential area of ''Nelson Park'' further inland and ''The Bay'' area situated along and below the cliffs.

==History==
During [[World War II]] most of the population were moved out and guns with their attendant [[military]] personnel were moved in. Most of the guns were anti-aircraft but there were smaller pieces intended to prevent [[Germans|German]] shipping from travelling along the [[France|French]] coast.  There were two 15 [[inch]] guns called "Jane" & "Clem" and there were also the two famous ex-Navy 14 inch guns called "Winnie" and "Pooh".  They originally came from the [[battleship]] [[HMS King George V (41)|HMS ''King George V'']].  On one occasion when [[Winston Churchill]] was visiting, it is rumoured that that "Winnie" was fired and the officer-in-charge saluted and reported, "A direct hit, Sir". "On what ?" enquired Winston, "Er - France, Sir".
There was a wooden dummy of "Pooh" but it obviously did not fool the Germans as legend has it that they dropped a wooden bomb.

Channel swimmers and submarine telephone cables start from here. The cliff above is where the sun is supposed first to reach the UK every morning.

During the war Sir [[Peter Ustinov]] was stationed here and liked it so much that he bought a house on the cliffs after the war. The house is now owned by [[Miriam Margolyes]], both have hosted functions to raise funds for our new Village Hall.

At the other end of the beach there are cottages two of which were owned by [[Noel Coward]] and [[Ian Fleming]].
