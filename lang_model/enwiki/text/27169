The '''Town of Fairplay''' is a [[Colorado municipalities#Statutory_Town|statutory town]] that is the [[county seat]] and the most populous town of [[Park County, Colorado|Park County]], [[Colorado]],  [[United States]].{{GR|6}}  Fairplay is located in [[South Park (Colorado basin)|South Park]] at an elevation of {{convert|9953|ft|m|0|sp=us}}.  The town is the fifth-highest incorporated place in the [[State of Colorado]].<ref name=mesalek/>  The population was 610 at the [[U.S. Census 2000]].  A historic [[gold]] [[mining]] settlement, the town was founded in 1859 during the early days of the [[Pike's Peak Gold Rush]]. It is the largest community in the grassland basin of Colorado known as [[South Park (Colorado basin)|South Park]], sitting on the west edge of the basin at the junction of [[U.S. Highway 285 (Colorado)|U.S. Highway 285]] and [[Colorado State Highway 9|State Highway 9]]. It is on a hillside just east of the [[Middle Fork South Platte River]], near where Highway 9 ascends the river valley northward to [[Alma, Colorado|Alma]] and [[Hoosier Pass]]. It is a quiet town, and the roads surrounding it have a low volume of traffic. Although it was founded during the initial [[placer mining]] boom, the mines in the area continued to produce gold and silver [[ore]] for many decades up through the middle of the 20th century.

The town consists of modern retail businesses along the highway, as well as a historic town on the bluff above the river along Front Street. The northern extension of Front Street along the river has been preserved and has become the site of relocated historic structures as an [[open air museum]] called [[South Park City]], intended to recreate the early days of the Colorado Gold Rush. Most of the residences in town are located on the hillside east of State Highway 9, in the vicinity of the schools and Park County Courthouse. The majority of the streets in town were finally paved in 2005.

The Town of Fairplay, Colorado, is the basis for the Town of South Park, Colorado, in the television series [[South Park]].<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.southparkstudios.com/fans/faq/archives.php?id=1850| title = FAQ - South Park Studios | publisher = South Park Studios | accessdate = 2010-04-06}}</ref>

== Burro Days ==
Burro Days is a festival held on the last weekend of July<ref>{{cite web|title=Burro Days|url=http://www.burrodays.com/index.htm|accessdate=2 June 2011}}</ref>. The event celebrates the town's mining heritage.  The main feature of the festival is a 29-mile burro race over rough terrain and approxmately 3,000-ft elevation gain from downtown Fairplay to the 13,000-ft summit of [[Mosquito Pass]]. Teams consist of one person and one [[Donkey|burro]].  The race takes about five hours to complete; first prize is $1,000. Previously, the first prize included an ounce of gold. There are several other [[burro racing|burro races]] in Colorado, the most notable takes place in [[Leadville, Colorado|Leadville]]. 

The Fairplay race is considered the World Championships of Burro Racing. At 29 miles, the Fairplay race is an [[ultra-marathon]] and the longest burro race in the state.<ref>{{cite web|title=Western Pack Burro Ass-ociation|url=http://www.packburroracing.com/#RULES|accessdate=2 June 2011}}</ref>  For many years (in the 1960s and early 1970s) the Burro race took place from Leadville to Fairplay, or vice versa, crossing over Mosquito Pass.  This followed the route that [[Father Dyer]] used for carrying mail and his preaching circuit.  With time the rivalry between the two cities proved the demise of this cooperative endeavor.

==''South Park'' animated series==
The town has become mildly famous in recent years as the town depicted in the ''[[South Park]]'' animated television series on [[Comedy Central]]. Although the geographical references contained in several episodes imply that Fairplay is the model for South Park, it is much smaller and more rustic than its fictional counterpart, which has a more [[suburban]] character.  Co-creator [[Trey Parker]] grew up in [[Conifer, Colorado|Conifer]] and went to high school in [[Evergreen, Colorado|Evergreen]], both of which are somewhat more affluent mountain communities immediately west of [[Denver, Colorado|Denver]] in [[Jefferson County, Colorado|Jefferson County]].  Co-creator [[Matt Stone]] lived in the Denver suburb of [[Littleton, Colorado|Littleton]]. 

Because the town is a regional center of government and commerce, the term "South Park" has historically been used in the town in the naming of institutions and business, including South Park High School (the namesake of which appears in the series).  The elementary school is Edith Teeter Elementary and the middle school is Silverheels Middle School.

Although the town of South Park is based upon the real life town of Fairplay, the latter is mentioned by [[Gerald Broflovski]] in the episode "[[Night of the Living Homeless]]" and described as "4 miles away" in "[[Jakovasaurus]]", which implies that it is a separate town in the show. The county seat offices in Fairplay are seen, though not mentioned by name, in the episode "[[Stanley's Cup]]".

A South Park parallel to the Burro race can be found in the [[Cow Days]] episode.
