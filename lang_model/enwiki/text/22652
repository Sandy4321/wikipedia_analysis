==Plot==
The film opens with a [[Film editing|montage]] of images of [[Manhattan]] accompanied by [[George Gershwin]]'s ''[[Rhapsody in Blue]]''. TV writer Isaac Davis ([[Woody Allen]]), is introduced as a man writing a book about his love for [[New York City]]. He is a twice-divorced 42-year-old dealing with the women in his life who gives up his unfulfilling job as a comedy writer. He is dating Tracy ([[Mariel Hemingway]]), a 17-year-old girl. His best friend, Yale ([[Michael Murphy (actor)|Michael Murphy]]), married to Emily (Anne Byrne), is having an affair with Mary Wilkie ([[Diane Keaton]]); her ex-husband and former teacher, Jeremiah ([[Wallace Shawn]]), also appears. Isaac's ex-wife Jill ([[Meryl Streep]]) is writing a confessional book about their marriage. Jill has also since [[come out of the closet]] as a [[lesbian]] and lives with her female partner Connie ([[Karen Ludwig]]).

When Isaac meets Mary, her cultural snobbery rubs him the wrong way. Isaac runs into her again at an [[Equal Rights Amendment]] fund-raising event at the [[Museum of Modern Art]] and accompanies her on a cab ride home. They chat until sunrise in a sequence that culminates in the iconic shot of the [[Queensboro Bridge]]. In spite of a growing attraction to Mary, Isaac continues his relationship with Tracy. But he emphasizes that theirs can't be a serious relationship and encourages the girl to go to London to study acting. In another iconic scene, at Tracy's request, they go on a carriage ride through [[Central Park]].

After Yale breaks up with Mary, he suggests Isaac ask her out. Isaac does, always having felt that Tracy was too young for him. Isaac breaks up with Tracy, much to her dismay, and before long Mary has virtually moved into his apartment. Emily is curious about Isaac's new girlfriend, and after several meetings between the two couples, including one where Emily reads out portions of Jill's new book about her marriage with Isaac, Yale leaves Emily to resume his relationship with Mary. A betrayed Isaac confronts Yale at the college where he teaches, and Yale argues that he found Mary first. Isaac responds by discussing Yale's extramarital affairs with Emily, but she thinks Isaac introduced Mary to Yale. In the denouement, Isaac lies on his sofa, musing into a tape recorder about the things that make "life worth living"<U+2014>the final item, after which he sets down the microphone, is "Tracy's face."

He leaves his apartment and sets out on foot for Tracy's. He arrives at her family's doorman apartment just as she is leaving for England. He says that she doesn't have to go and that he doesn't want "that special thing" about her to change. She replies that the plans have already been made and reassures him that "not everyone gets corrupted" and "You've got to have faith in people". He gives her a slight smile segueing into final shots of the skyline with ''Rhapsody in Blue'' playing again.

According to Allen, the idea for ''Manhattan'' originated from his love of [[George Gershwin]]'s music. He was listening to one of the composer's albums of overtures and thought, "this would be a beautiful thing to make ... a movie in black and white ... a romantic movie".<ref name= "fox">{{cite news | last = Fox | first = Julian | coauthors = | title = Woody: Movies from Manhattan | work = | pages = | language = | publisher = Overlook Hardcover | date = September 1, 1996 | url =  | accessdate = }}</ref> Allen has said that ''Manhattan'' was "like a mixture of what I was trying to do with ''[[Annie Hall]]'' and ''[[Interiors]]''".<ref name= "brode">{{cite news | last = Brode | first = Douglas | coauthors = | title = Woody Allen: His Films and Career | work = | pages = | language = | publisher = Citadel Press | year = 1987 | url =  | accessdate = }}</ref> He also said that his film deals with the problem of people trying to live a decent existence in an essential junk-obsessed contemporary culture without selling out, admitting that he himself could conceive of giving away all of "[his] possessions to charity and living in much more modest circumstances", continuing, "I've rationalized my way out of it so far, but I could conceive of doing it".<ref name= "timemag">{{cite news | last = Rich | first = Frank | coauthors = | title = An Interview with Woody | work = | pages = | language = | publisher = [[Time (magazine)|Time]] | date = April 30, 1979 | url =  | accessdate = }}</ref>

Allen talked to cinematographer [[Gordon Willis]] about how fun it would be to shoot the film in [[Black-and-white|black and white]], [[Panavision]] [[Aspect ratio (image)|aspect ratio]] ([[2.35:1]]) because it would give "a great look at New York City, which is sort of one of the characters in the film".<ref name= "bjorkman">{{cite news | last = Bjorkman | first = Stig | coauthors = | title = Woody Allen on Woody Allen | work = | pages = 108 | language = | publisher = [[Grove Press]] | year = 1993 | url =  | accessdate = }}</ref> Allen decided to shoot his film in black and white "because that's how I remember it from when I was small. Maybe it's a reminiscence from old photographs, films, books and all that. But that's how I remember New York. I always heard Gershwin music with it, too. In ''Manhattan'' I really think that we <U+2014> that's me and cinematographer Gordon Willis <U+2014> succeeded in showing the city.

When the sun comes up, the bridge lights go off. Willis made arrangements with the city to leave the lights on and he would let them know when they got the shot. Afterwards, they could be turned off. As they started to shoot the scene, one string of bridge lights went out and Allen was forced to use that take.<ref name="Willis" />

After finishing the film, Allen was very unhappy with it and asked United Artists not to release it. He offered to make a film for free instead.<ref name="Bjorkman2">Bjorkman 1993, p. 116.</ref> Allen has never said why he disliked the movie in any interview which has puzzled many of his fans who consider it to be one of his best.

There's no opportunity to heap condescending abuse on the phonies and sellouts decorating the Hollywood landscape.

Hoberman]] wrote in the ''[[Village Voice]]'', "The New York City that Woody so tediously defended in ''[[Annie Hall]]'' was in crisis. And so he imagined an improved version.

==Home release==
Allen wanted to preserve Willis's [[Composition (visual arts)|composition]]s and insisted that the aspect ratio be preserved when the film was released on video (an unusual request in a time when widescreen films were normally [[pan and scan|panned and scanned]] for TV and video release). As a result, all copies of the film on video (and most television broadcasts) were [[letterbox]]ed, originally with a gray border.<ref name= "fox"/>
