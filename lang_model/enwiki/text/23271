'''Elixir''' is a women's fragrance by [[Colombian people|Colombian]] singer songwriter [[Shakira]], developed in a collaboration with international fashion company [[Puig (company)|Puig]]. After the release of her first two [[S by Shakira|fragrances]], Puig enlisted several perfumers to work on Shakira's third fragrance, which she claimed would capture her "most sensual and exotic side."<ref name=infowwd /> The final product was Elixir, an [[Perfume#Traditional|oriental]] perfume based on various spicy and woody sources. The flacon of the perfume is inspired by [[apothecary]] bottles and is made to resemble a magical potion, featuring a light golden colour scheme.

Shakira launched the fragrance at a press release in [[S<U+00E3>o Paulo]], Brazil, in July 2012. Additionally, [[Jaume de Laiguana]] directed a commercial for the fragrance, which was filmed in the [[Sahara]] desert in Morocco. In August 2013, Wild Elixir was released as a [[Flanker (perfume)|flanker]] fragrance to Elixir. The [[Perfume#Traditional|floral]] oriental perfume is similar to the original one in appearance but features a variation in the colour scheme. It was promoted through a commercial which features Shakira encountering two cheetahs in an arid landscape.

In 2008, international fashion and [[fragrance]] company [[Puig (company)|Puig]] announced that it had formed a partnership with Shakira and had signed an agreement "to develop a line of signature products produced with and inspired by the artist".<ref name=puigpartnershipstatemnt>{{cite web|last=Morgan|first=Kera|title=Shakira and Puig Partner in Newly Formed Beauty and Personal Care Enterprise|url=http://www.puig.com/uploads/pressreltranslation/en_GB/c3461a7a58358e8508bacccdf8bfce.pdf|publisher=[[Puig (company)|Puig]]|accessdate=3 November 2013|format=PDF}}</ref> The first product to appear was [[S by Shakira]], which was released in September 2010, followed by [[S by Shakira Eau Florale]].<ref name=releasecontactmusic2010>{{cite web|title=Shakira Smells Success With Perfume Launch|url=http://www.contactmusic.com/news/shakira-smells-success-with-perfume-launch_1156105|publisher=[[Contactmusic.com]]|accessdate=4 November 2013|author=Wenn|date=2 August 2010}}</ref>
