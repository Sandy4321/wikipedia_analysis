===2007===
Mallett made his first appearance at Michigan in the second game of the 2007 season against [[Oregon Ducks football|Oregon]]. He entered the game for the injured [[Chad Henne]] in the third quarter and completed 6 of 17 passes for 49 yards and one interception. Mallett started the next week against [[Notre Dame Fighting Irish football|Notre Dame]] and led the Wolverines to a 38-0 victory by throwing 3 touchdown passes, going 7/15 (46.7%) for 90 yards. Mallett started his first Big Ten conference game against [[Penn State Nittany Lions football|Penn State]] the following week. He went 16/29 (55.2%) with 170 yards and one interception. He also scored on a 10-yard rush in the first quarter. Henne returned to start the Wolverines' next three games. In those games, Mallett had limited playing time completing 4/10 for 30 yards. 

Mallett's next start was against [[2007 Minnesota Golden Gophers football team|Minnesota]]. He threw a touchdown pass and went 11/20 (55.0%) with 233 yards and no interceptions. Mallett did not start,  but played extensively the next week in a loss against [[2007 Wisconsin Badgers football team|Wisconsin]]. He threw 3 touchdown passes and went 11/36 (30.6%) with 245 yards and two interceptions. In the fourth quarter, Mallett threw a 97 yard touchdown pass to [[Mario Manningham]], the longest pass completion in Michigan history.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mgoblue.com/sports/m-footbl/spec-rel/092110aac.html|title=Five Longest Passes in Program History|accessdate=2010-10-20|publisher=[[CBS Interactive]]|date=2010-09-21}}</ref> Mallett played very little in the next week's game against [[2007 Ohio State Buckeyes football team|Ohio State]]. He threw three passes and completed one of them for eight yards.

===Departure from Michigan===
Mallett's departure from Michigan was widely expected after new head coach [[Rich Rodriguez]] was hired to replace retiring coach [[Lloyd Carr]]. Rodriguez overhauled Michigan's offense and installed a [[spread offense|"spread" option offensive scheme]], which did not fit Mallett's skills as a drop-back, pocket quarterback.

On January 14, 2008, Mallett made his move back to his home state official and enrolled at the [[University of Arkansas]], where he was ineligible to play during the 2008 season due to NCAA transfer policies.

===Arkansas===
====2009====
In 2009 as a redshirt sophomore, Mallett began his career as an [[Arkansas Razorbacks football|Arkansas Razorback]], under the direction of head coach [[Bobby Petrino]]. Prior to the 2009 season, Mallett was named by [[ESPN]]'s Bruce Feldman as one of college football's top 10 newcomers of the year, citing his arm strength as a major determining factor.<ref>[http://insider.espn.go.com/espn/blog/index?entryID=3965397&name=feldman_bruce&action=login Feldman: Top 10 newcomers - ESPN<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> In subsequent interviews, when Mallett was questioned about how far he could throw the football, he said farther than 80 yards.<ref>http://nwahomepage.com/content/fulltextsports?cid=76291</ref>

On March 1, 2009, he was arrested on charges of public intoxication.<ref>[http://ncaafootball.fanhouse.com/2009/03/02/arkansas-qb-ryan-mallett-busted-for-public-intoxication/ Arkansas QB Ryan Mallett Busted for Public Intoxication<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.usatoday.com/sports/college/football/sec/2009-03-01-arkansas-ryan-mallett_N.htm | work=USA Today | title=Arkansas QB Ryan Mallett arrested for public intoxication | date=March 1, 2009 | accessdate=May 23, 2010}}</ref> He pled guilty to the [[misdemeanor]] charge on April 3, 2009 and paid $155 in court costs, fines, and fees. Mallett was also punished by Coach Petrino with early wake up calls, extra running, and early curfews.<ref>[http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2009/football/ncaa/04/04/Mallett.DUI.ap/index.html Mallett Pleads Guilty to Public Intoxication] SI.com, April 4, 2009</ref>

Mallett earned the starting job in the Razorbacks' first game against [[Missouri State Bears|Missouri State]], going 17-of-22 for 309 yards and a touchdown. Two weeks later, Mallett passed for 408 yards and five touchdowns against [[2010 Georgia Bulldogs football team|Georgia]] in a losing effort. The passing yardage and touchdowns were single game school records. Ryan would throw for more than 250 yards in three of Arkansas' next five games, with nine touchdowns against three interceptions. Impressive victories over Texas A&M and Auburn were coupled with tough losses to Alabama and Ole Miss, and a loss vs. Florida. After a dismal 3-4 start, Mallett led Arkansas to three consecutive victories over Eastern Michigan (14-of-16 for 248 yards and three touchdowns), South Carolina (23-of-27 for 329 yards and one rushing touchdown), and Troy (23-of-30 for 405 yards, five touchdowns and one interception). Over those three games, he completed 83.1 % of his passes, and had a quarterback rating of 165.05, which was third-best in the nation. The victory over Troy pushed Arkansas' record to 6-4 and secured the Hogs' bowl eligibility, with games against Mississippi State and LSU remaining. Mallett went on to throw for 313 yards and matched his career high of five touchdown passes in a 42-21 victory over Mississippi State. The following week, he threw for 227 yards and a touchdown in a 33-30 overtime loss to LSU in Baton Rouge. Ryan was named to the All-SEC 2nd Team squad by the coaches and the AP for his performance during the season, behind Florida QB [[Tim Tebow]] despite superior passing statistics. The Razorbacks finished the 2009 season with an 8-5 record and won the [[2010 Liberty Bowl (January)|2010 Liberty Bowl]] against [[East Carolina University]], 20-17 in OT. Mallett was named the bowl game's Offensive MVP. 

Mallett currently owns sixteen school records, including most passing yards in a season (3,627), most consecutive passes without an INT, most passing yards in a game (408), most passing touchdowns in a game (5 - three times), only quarterback to pass for over 400 yards in a game (two times), most pass plays of 25 or more yards in a season, and most passing TD in a single season (30). 

Mallett chose to forgo entering the [[2010 NFL Draft]], and return for his junior season at Arkansas. Mallett was considered among the top five quarterbacks if he had entered the draft. {{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}

Mallett matched or broke 16 school records at Arkansas in 2009.

Mallett's performance in 2009 led to higher expectations in [[2010 Arkansas Razorbacks football team|2010]]. The junior stated that he wished to change the mindset of Arkansas fans into that of a winning program. The confident Mallett was quoted saying, "I'm looking for 14," when asked about how many wins the 2010 Razorbacks could achieve.<ref name="si" />

On September 4, 2010, Mallet completed 21-of-24 passes (87.5%), setting an Arkansas school record for completion percentage in a game.

Arkansas defeated [[Tennessee Tech]] in the game 44-3.

Mallett finished seventh in voting for the 2010 [[Heisman Trophy]] award.<ref>Taylor, John. "Cam Newton runs away with the Heisman." December 11, 2010. [http://collegefootballtalk.nbcsports.com/2010/12/11/cam-newton-runs-away-with-the-heisman/related/ Article.] Retrieved December 11, 2010.</ref>

On January 6, 2011, Mallett decided to forgo his senior year at Arkansas and declare for the [[2011 NFL Draft]] shortly after [[Andrew Luck]] decided to stay for his junior year,<ref>[http://www.nfl.com/news/story/09000d5d81d83e10/article/arkansas-qb-mallett-declares-intention-to-enter-nfl-draft]</ref> though Mallett said that Luck's decision did not impact his own.

==Professional career==
===New England Patriots (2011<U+2013>present)===
Mallett, who was often projected prior to the draft as a first-round talent,<ref>[http://www.nfl.com/news/story/09000d5d81f526d4/article/malletts-stock-character-trending-up-as-draft-approaches]</ref> fell to the third round of the [[2011 NFL Draft]], where he was selected 74th overall by the [[New England Patriots]] (using the pick they received when they traded [[Randy Moss]] to the [[Minnesota Vikings]]); that pick is the highest pick the Patriots have used on a quarterback since taking [[Drew Bledsoe]] number one overall in [[1993 NFL Draft|1993]]. According to [[Michael Lombardi]] of the [[NFL Network]], the Patriots rated Mallett as the best quarterback available in the 2011 draft; nevertheless, six other quarterbacks were taken before the Patriots drafted him,<ref>[http://www.nfl.com/videos/nfl-draft/09000d5d81f97efa/Perfect-fit-for-Mallett]</ref> drawing comparisons to [[Tom Brady]], who was the seventh quarterback chosen in [[2000 NFL Draft|2000]], though with the 199th pick.<ref>[http://espn.go.com/blog/afceast/post/_/id/28560/mallet-6-script-waiting-to-be-written]</ref>

====2011 season====
Mallett made his preseason debut in the Patriots' first preseason game, a 47<U+2013>12 rout of the [[Jacksonville Jaguars]] on August 11. He played the entire second half, completing 12 of 19 passes for 164 yards, one touchdown, and no interceptions. The Patriots scored touchdowns on each of the first four drives Mallett led, and ran out the clock on his fifth and final drive. Mallet struggled in his next preseason games throwing a interception run for a touchdown in his second game.  At his fourth preseason game against the [[New York Giants|Giants]] he was 6 for 16 for 57 yards.  He is now a third string QB behind Brian Hoyer and Tom Brady<ref>{{cite web |title=Gabbert inconsistent at best in NFL debut for Jaguars |url=http://nbcsports.msnbc.com/id/44115874/ |publisher=[[Associated Press|AP]] |first=Howard |last=Ulman |date=August 12, 2011 |accessdate=August 12, 2011}}</ref>

==Stature==
NFL.com lists Mallett as standing 6'7", and weighing 253 pounds,<ref>[http://www.nfl.com/combine/profiles/ryan-mallett?id=2495443]</ref> while the Patriots' website lists him an inch shorter and 15 pounds lighter (6'6", 238 pounds).<ref>[http://www.patriots.com/team/index.cfm?ac=playerbio&bio=34353]</ref>
