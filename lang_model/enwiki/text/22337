According to his obituary in ''The Times''  by Richard Wollheim,   his most important contribution to philosophy was to reawaken interest in German Idealism at a time (the 1960s) when it was largely neglected in British philosophy departments. His books on Schopenhauer and Kierkegaard were  "models of how to respect the extremity of an author's thinking without condoning it" and "recaptured a whole philosophical terrain for the sophisticated reader"<ref>.
