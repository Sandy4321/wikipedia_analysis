Diwan Bahadur '''Sir Perungavur Rajagopalachari, '''[[Order of the Star of India|KCSI]], [[Order of the Indian Empire|CIE]] (18 March 1862 &ndash; 1 December 1927), also known (incorrectly) by the British as '''Sir P. Rajagopala Achariyar''', was an [[India]]n administrator. He was the [[Diwan (title)|Diwan]] (chief minister) of [[Cochin State]] from December 1896 to August 1901 and of [[Travancore]] from 1906 to 1914.

==Early life and career==
Rajagopalachari was born in [[Madras]] and educated at [[Presidency College, Madras|Presidency College]] and [[Madras Law College]]. He joined the Judicial Department [[Indian Civil Service]] on 3 May 1886 and was appointed deputy [[district collector|collector]] in December 1887. From 2 May 1890 to December 1896, he served as assistant collector and [[magistrate]] in [[Madras Province]].

==Diwan of Cochin==
In December 1896, Rajagopalachari was appointed Diwan by Maharaja [[Rama Varma XV]] of Cochin. He served in his capacity from 1896 to 1901. During his tenure as diwan, the Cochin Native Merchants Association was founded.<ref name="icci_cochin">{{Cite web|url=http://www.iccicochin.com/history.html|title=History of the Indian Chamber of Commerce and Industry - Cochin|accessdate=2008-07-12|publisher=iccicochin.com}}</ref> This later became the Indian Chamber of Commerce and Industry - Cochin.<ref name="icci_cochin" /> In 1901, the Central Records of the Cochin State were established at [[Tripunithara]].<ref name="cochin_archives">{{cite news | last= | first= | title= Missing chapter in history of universal schooling  | date=July 23, 2003 | url =http://www.my-kerala.com/n/a/2003/7/ | work =Archive Files to enter hard disk | accessdate = 2008-07-12}}</ref> This later evolved into the Kerala State Archives Department.<ref name="cochin_archives" />
   
==Diwan of Travancore==
In 1901, he was appointed Registrar of Co-operative Credit Societies in the [[Madras Presidency]] and then served as Assistant Collector from March 1902 until 1906, when he was appointed Diwan of Travancore state.

The [[Sadhu Jana Paripalana Sangham]] was established in 1907 by social reformer [[Ayyankali]] to campaign for education for [[Dalit]]s.<ref name="ayyankali_chapter3">[[#ayyankali|Ayyankali]], Chapter 3:Sadhu Jana Paripalana Sangham</ref> Rajagopalachari was supportive of the movement, and in 1907 the government of Travancore passed an order for the admission of Dalit children in schools.<ref name="ayyankali_chapter4">[[#ayyankali|Ayyankali]], Chapter 4:Kerala's First Workers Strike</ref> However, the upper-caste landlords who owned most of the schools were obstinate in allowing Dalit children into their schools and openly defied the government order.<ref name="ayyankali_chapter4" /> A major strike erupted. Low caste agragrian workers refused to farm their fields.<ref name="ayyankali_chapter5">[[#ayyankali|Ayyankali]], Chapter 5:The First ever agrarian workers strike</ref> In 1910, Rajagopalachari and Mitchell, who headed the education department, made the order for admission of Dalit children public, thereby putting an end to the controversy.<ref name="ayyankali_chapter6">[[#ayyankali|Ayyankali]], Chapter 6:School Entry</ref><ref name="dalitschool">{{cite news | last=Chekutty | first=N.

Rajagopalachari also brought forth reforms in the administration. Dalits, who were previously excluded from the administration, were made eligible for nomination to the State Assembly.<ref name="ayyankali_chapter8">[[#ayyankali|Ayyankali]], Chapter 8:Praja Sabha Member-2e</ref> Ayyankali became the first Dalit member to be nominated to the Travancore State Assembly.<ref name="ayyankali_chapter8" />

Rajagopalachari's administration had its own share of controversies. M. A. Shakoor, in his biography of [[Vakkom Moulavi]], calls Rajagopalachari's administration "authoritarian".<ref name="vakkom_moulavi">{{Cite web|url=http://www.vmft.org/documents/moulavi.htm|title=VAKKOM MAULAVI - THE MAN WHO LED ISLAMIC RENAISSANCE IN KERALA A TRAIL BLAZER IN POLITICAL JOURNALISM |accessdate=2008-07-12|publisher=Vakkom Moulavi Foundation Trust|author=M.A.Shakoor }}</ref>

==Later life and career==
In 1914, Rajagopalachari returned to Madras as Secretary of the Judicial Department, the first Indian to hold the post. 
In 1917, he was appointed to the Council of the [[Governor of Madras]]. When the [[Madras Legislative Council]] came into being, as per the provisions of the [[Government of India Act 1919]], on 17 December 1920, Rajagopalachari was elected as the first President.<ref name="saminkannu_pillai_bio">{{cite book | title=L.D.
