'''Stacy Warner''' is a fictional recurring character portrayed by [[Sela Ward]] on the [[Fox Broadcasting Company]]'s [[medical drama]] ''[[House (TV series)|House]]''. She was in a relationship with [[Gregory House|Dr. Gregory House]] ([[Hugh Laurie]]), when he suffered an [[infarction]] in his right leg during a game of golf. This was caused by a clotted [[aneurysm]] in his thigh, which had led to an infarction that caused his quadriceps muscle to become [[necrosis|necrotic]]. Regarding House's treatment, Stacy acted against House's wishes when he was put into a chemically induced [[coma]]. She authorized a safer surgical middle-ground procedure by removing just the dead muscle, leaving House with a lesser, but serious, level of pain for the rest of his life. House could not forgive her and they broke up. The two meet again, five years later, at the end of season one; Stacy wants House to treat her husband, Mark. House correctly diagnoses Mark with [[acute intermittent porphyria]], and so he has to remain at the hospital for close monitoring. Stacy becomes the hospital's lawyer, and she and House grow closer together. When she is ultimately willing to leave Mark for him, House tells her to go back to Mark, which devastates her and causes her and Mark to leave the city.

When the writers of the show wrote "[[Three Stories (House)|Three Stories]]", the first episode in which Stacy appeared, the first name they came up with to play the character was Sela Ward. Although Ward was not initially interested in portraying Stacy, she changed her mind after watching tapes of the show. While she was originally hired to appear in only two episodes of the first season, the chemistry between Ward and Laurie was strong enough to have her appear in seven more second season episodes. Stacy was received mostly positive by critics who considered her arc a "juicy subplot".<ref name="initiallyfellinlovewith" /> Although there have been no plans revealed, both Ward and [[David Shore]], the show's creator, have expressed interest in Stacy returning.

Although not much is revealed about Stacy's early life, it is said in "Acceptance" that she is a [[Duke University]] graduate.<ref name="acceptance">{{cite episode |title=Acceptance|episodelink=Acceptance (House)|series=House, M.D. |serieslink=House (TV series) |credits=Lerner, Garrett; Friend, Russel |network=[[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] |airdate=2005-09-13 |season=2 |number=1}}</ref> Presumably ten years before the events of ''House'', at a "Doctors vs. Lawyers" [[paintball]] game, she met [[Gregory House|Dr. Gregory House]] ([[Hugh Laurie]]) with whom she started a romantic relationship.<ref name="comaguy">{{cite episode |title=Son of Coma Guy|episodelink=Son of Coma Guy|series=House, M.D. |serieslink=House (TV series) |credits=Shore, David; Egan, Doris |network=[[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] |airdate=2006-11-14 |season=3 |number=7}}</ref> Five years later, during a game of golf, House suffered an [[infarction]] in his right leg.<ref name="threestories" /> He was admitted at the Princeton-Plainsboro Teaching Hospital, but went misdiagnosed for three days due to doctors' concerns that he was exhibiting drug-seeking behavior (House eventually diagnosed the infarction himself).<ref name="threestories" /> An [[aneurysm]] in his thigh had clotted, leading to an infarction and causing his quadriceps muscle to become [[necrosis|necrotic]].<ref name="threestories" /> House had the dead muscle bypassed in order to restore circulation to the remainder of his leg, risking organ failure and cardiac arrest.<ref name="threestories" /> He was willing to endure excruciating post-operative pain to retain the use of his leg.<ref name="threestories" /> After he was put into a chemically induced [[coma]] to sleep through the worst of the pain, Stacy, his medical proxy at the time, acted against his wishes and authorized a safer surgical middle-ground procedure between [[amputation]] and a bypass by removing just the dead muscle.<ref name="threestories" /> This resulted in the partial loss of use in his leg, and left House with a lesser, but still serious, level of pain for the rest of his life.<ref name="threestories" /> House could not forgive Stacy for making the decision, which caused their relationship to end.<ref name="threestories" />
