'''Paul Pierre Broca''' ([[June 28]], [[1824]] &ndash; [[July 9]], [[1880]]) was a [[France|French]] [[physician]], [[anatomist]], and [[anthropologist]]. He was born in [[Sainte-Foy-la-Grande]], France.

==Education and research==
Broca was a brilliant student. He entered [[medical school]] in [[Paris]] when he was only 17 years old and graduated at 20, when most of his contemporaries were just beginning as [[medical student]]s. 

Broca soon became a [[professor]] of [[surgery|surgical]] [[pathology]] at the [[University of Paris]]. He quickly excelled as a noted medical researcher in many areas. At the age of 24 he had received many awards, medals, and important positions. His early [[scientific research|scientific]] works dealt with the [[histology]] of [[cartilage]] and [[bone]], but he also studied [[cancer]] pathology, the treatment of [[aneurysms]], and [[infant mortality]]. One of his major concerns was the comparative anatomy of the brain. His celebrated paper refers to many animal species. As a [[neuroanatomy|neuroanatomist]] he made important contributions to the understanding of the [[limbic system]] and [[rhinencephalon]]. Olfaction was for him a sign of animality. His research on the localization of speech led to entirely new research into the [[lateralization of brain function]]. He wrote extensively on [[Darwinism]], known as transformism in France.

==Speech research==
Broca is most famous for his discovery of the [[speech]] production center of the [[brain]] located in the ventroposterior region of the [[frontal lobe]]s (now known as the [[Broca's area]]). He arrived at this discovery by studying the brains of [[aphasia|aphasic]] patients (persons with speech and language disorders resulting from brain injuries), particularly the brain of his first patient in the [[Bic<U+00EA>tre Hospital]], Leborgne, nicknamed "Tan" due to his inability to clearly speak any words other than "tan".

In 1861, through [[post-mortem]] autopsy, Broca determined that Tan had a [[lesion]] caused by [[syphilis]] in the left [[cerebral hemisphere]]. This lesion was determined to cover the area of the brain important for speech production. Although history credits this discovery to Broca, it should be noted that another French neurologist, [[Marc Dax]], made similar observations a generation earlier.

Patients with damage to [[Broca's area]] and/or to neighboring regions of the left inferior frontal lobe are often categorized clinically as having [[Broca's aphasia]]. This type of aphasia, which often involves impairments in speech output, can be contrasted with [[Wernicke's aphasia]], named for [[Karl Wernicke]], which is characterized by damage to more [[Anatomical terms of location|posterior]] regions of the left hemisphere (in the superior [[temporal lobe]]), and by greater impairments in speech comprehension.

==Anthropology research==
Broca was also a pioneer in the study of [[physical anthropology]]. He founded the Anthropological Society in 1859, the ''Revue d'Anthropologie'' in 1872, and the School of Anthropology in [[Paris]] in 1876. Just like everyone else in his time he had no reason to think that the skulls of living people were trepanned prior to the time of the ancient Greeks.  The situation changed dramatically for him and subsequently for scientists around the world in 1867, after he was shown an old Peruvian skull with cross-hatched cuts.  This skull came from an Inca cemetery in the valley of Yucay and was shown to him by Ephraim George Squier, an archaeologist, writer, and diplomat.  Careful examination of the Peruvian skull left no doubt in Broca's mind that "advanced surgery" had been performed in the [[New World]] before the European conquest. 

Broca advanced the science of [[cranial anthropometry]] by developing many new types of measuring instruments ([[craniometry|craniometers]]) and numerical indices. The uses that reputable scientists, including [[racism|racist]] ones, made of Broca's measurements and conclusions have been analyzed by [[Stephen Jay Gould]] in ''[[The Mismeasure of Man]]'' (1981) and by his biographer, Francis Schiller. Broca's work is also featured in [[Carl Sagan]]'s book ''[[Broca's Brain: Reflections on the Romance of Science|Broca's Brain]]''.  [[Francisco Goya]] had his skull hidden and not buried with the rest of his body as a direct response to Broca's work in this area.

==Anatomy research==
Another field in which Broca contributed significantly was the [[comparative anatomy]] of [[primate]]s.  He described, for the first time, [[Trepanation|trephined skulls]] from the [[Neolithic]]. He was very interested in the relation between anatomical features of the brain and mental capabilities, such as [[intelligence (trait)|intelligence]].

==Personal life==
As a personality, Broca was a remarkable individual. His biographer, neurosurgeon Francis Schiller, records his fights with his local [[church]] which attempted to have him stricken from the electoral roll. Broca was denounced by authorities as a [[subversive]], [[materialist]], and corrupter of the youth after he founded a society of [[Freethought|freethinkers]] in [[1848]] sympathetic to [[Charles Darwin]]'s theories.

Broca was often speculated to be a homosexual by others, although proof of this was never found. His wife always argued otherwise.

Near the end of his life, Paul Broca was elected a [[senator for life#France|lifetime member]] of the [[French Senate]]. He was also a member of the [[Acad<U+00E9>mie Fran<U+00E7>aise]] and held [[honorary degree]]s from many other learned institutions, both in France and abroad. Broca died in Paris in 1880.

==Broca's Legacy==
The discovery of the Broca's area revolutionized the understanding of speech production. New research has found that dysfunction in the Broca's area may lead to other speech disorders such as [[stuttering]] and [[apraxia|apraxia of speech]]. Recent anatomical [[neuroimaging]] studies have shown that the [[pars opercularis]] of the Broca's area is anatomically smaller in individuals who stutter whereas the [[pars triangularis]] appears to be normal.
