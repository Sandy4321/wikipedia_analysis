'''Simson L. Garfinkel''' joined the [[National Institute of Standards and Technology]] in Gaithersberg, Maryland, in January 2015 as Senior Advisor, Information Access Division.{{cn|date=April 2015}} His current research includes privacy and data de-identification.

Garfinkel was formerly an Associate Professor at the [[Naval Postgraduate School]] in [[Monterey, California]] from 2006 to January 2015. Garfinkel is regarded as a leader in the fields of [[digital forensics]] and [[HCISec|usable security]]. In addition to his academic work, Garfinkel is a [[journalist]], an [[entrepreneur]], and an [[inventor]]; his work in all three is concerned with [[computer security]], [[privacy]], and [[information technology]].

Garfinkel is the author or co-author of 14 books, and the author of more than a thousand articles.<ref name="PersBio">Simson Garfinkel Bio, http://simson.net/page/Bio</ref>  He is a contributing writer for ''[[Technology Review]]''<ref>"Staff List," Technology Review.com, July 7, 2008 http://www.technologyreview.com/corp/staff.aspx</ref> and has written as a freelancer for many publications including ''[[Wired magazine]]'', ''[[The Boston Globe]]'', ''[[Privacy Journal]]'' and ''[[CSO Magazine]].'' His work for ''CSO Magazine'' earned him five regional and national journalism awards, including the Jesse H. Neal Business Journalism Awards in 2003 and 2004.<ref>[http://www.csoonline.com/marketing/awards]{{dead link|date=April 2015}}</ref>

As an entrepreneur, Garfinkel founded Vineyard.NET, an Internet service provider on Martha's Vineyard, and [[Sandstorm Enterprises]], a computer security firm that develops advanced computer forensic tools used by businesses and governments to audit their systems.  Garfinkel holds six [[patent]]s,<ref>{{US Patent|7779032}}{{US Patent|7023854}}{{US Patent|6993661}}{{US Patent|6744864}}{{US Patent|6678270}}{{US Patent|6490349}}</ref> mostly in the field of computer security.

Garfinkel obtained three [[Bachelor of Science|SB]] degrees from [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]] in 1987; a [[Master of Science|MS]] in [[journalism]] from [[Columbia University]] in 1988; and a [[Doctor of Philosophy|PhD]] in [[computer science]] from MIT in 2005.  He was a postdoctoral fellow at the [[Center for Research on Computation and Society]] at [[Harvard University]] from September 2005 through August 2008.<ref>[http://crcs.seas.harvard.edu/ Harvard CRCS ]</ref> In 2012 he was named a Fellow of the [[Association for Computing Machinery|ACM]].<ref name="ACM_press-releases_fellows-2012">{{cite web

== Research ==
Garfinkel's early research was in the field of [[optical storage]]. While he was an undergraduate at the [[MIT Media Laboratory]] Garfinkel developed CDFS, the first file system for write-once optical disk systems.<ref>S. Garfinkel, "A file system for write once media, MIT Media Lab., Oct. 1986.</ref> During the summer of 1987 he worked at Brown University's [[Iris Project (Brown University)|IRIS Project]], where he developed a server allowing CDROMs to be shared over a network simultaneously by multiple workstations.<ref>Designing a write-once file system (a general-purpose optical storage software technology), Dr. Dobb's Journal, 1991, Jan, pp. 78, 80, 82--26.</ref>

In 1991, while a Senior Editor at [[NeXTWORLD Magazine]], Garfinkel created an address book program for the NeXT Computer called [[SBook]]. One of SBook's most popular features was a search field that performed a full-text search of ''all'' of the records in the address book with each keypress. This kind of search is now standard on many computer programs, including Apple's Mail application and Mozilla Thunderbird. It is believed that SBook was the first program to incorporate this kind of search technology.

In 1995, Garfinkel moved to Martha's Vineyard and started [[Vineyard.NET]], the Vineyard's first Internet Service Provider. Vineyard.NET was bought by [http://simson.net/ref/2000/bb2w/ Broadband2Wireless], a wireless ISP, in 2000.  The company went bankrupt in September 2001,<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-10420118_IT|title=Broadband2Wireless files for bankruptcy|date=2001-09-01}} {{Dead link|date=August 2010|bot=RjwilmsiBot}}</ref> and Garfinkel bought Vineyard.NET back from the bankruptcy court.

In 2003, Garfinkel and [[abhi shelat]] published [http://www.simson.net/clips/academic/2003.IEEE.DiskDriveForensics.pdf an article] in [[IEEE Security & Privacy Magazine]] reporting on an experiment in which they purchased 158 used hard drives from a variety of sources and checked to see whether they still contained readable data.  Roughly one third of the drives appeared to have information that was highly confidential and should have been erased prior to the drive's resale.

In 2006, Garfinkel introduced [[Cross-Drive Analysis]], an unsupervised machine learning algorithm for automatically reconstructing social networks from hard drives and other kinds of data carrying devices that are likely to contain pseudo-unique information.<ref>Garfinkel, S., "Forensic Feature Extraction and Cross-Drive Analysis," Digital Investigation, Volume 3, Supplement 1, September 2006, Pages 71--81. http://www.simson.net/clips/academic/2006.DFRWS.pdf</ref>

In September 2006, Garfinkel joined the faculty of the [[Naval Postgraduate School]] (NPS) in [[Monterey, California]], as an Associate Professor of Computer Science.<ref>[http://www.nps.navy.mil/cs/]{{dead link|date=April 2015}}</ref> He moved to [[Arlington, Virginia]], in June 2010 to help NPS with its research aims in the National Capital Region.
