'''''Luminary''''', a public sculpture by American artist Jeff Laramore, is located on the [[Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis]] campus, which is near downtown [[Indianapolis]], Indiana. This sculpture is made from [[onyx]] stone and sits as the cornerstone of the [[IU]] Simon Cancer Center at the north-west corner of Michigan and University Streets. 

The focal point of the sculpture is an onyx stone sphere that is illuminated at night.  The sphere is approximately {{convert|50|in|m}} high with a circumference of {{convert|157|in|m}}.  The core sphere of the sculpture is surrounded by concrete supports pieces designed in a wave-like pattern.  The dimensions of the sculpture with the [[concrete]] supports are approximately {{convert|4|ft}} high, {{convert|41|ft}} long, and {{convert|5|ft}} wide.

==Design==
''Luminary'' consists of a sphere shape sculpture surrounded by a concrete wave design.  The central sphere is made from thin tiles of onyx stone, specifically Sardonyx a variety of [[agate]] with reddish-brown dark and light bands of color.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mindat.org/min-7604.html  |title=Sardonyx: Sardonyx mineral information and data. |author=Ralph, Jolyon and Ida Chau |date=1993<U+2013>2009|work= |publisher=Mindat.org|accessdate= November 29, 2009 }}</ref> Each of the stone tiles ranges in size from 2 to 4&nbsp;inches long with varying widths and are arranged in a swirling pattern. The sculpture is neutral in color with the stone varying from light flesh tone shades of beige to softer pink and reddish hues.  

At nighttime the central sphere is illuminated by an internal light source.  The glow of this light shines through the thin opaque onyx and creates the appearance of a [[luminary]], a body or object that gives light.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/luminary  |title=Luminary Definition |author=The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language, Fourth Edition |year=2004|work= |publisher=Houghton Mifflin Company|accessdate= November 30, 2009 }}</ref>  Two large "waves" of concrete embrace the central sphere.  These concrete supports are approximately 18 feet long and have a groove pattern that matches the flower beds surrounding the sculpture.

==Commission==
''Luminary'' was commissioned by Clarian Health Partners to be part of the new I.U. Simon Cancer Center which opened in August 2008. It is located at the north-west corner of Michigan Street and University Boulevard.  The sculpture has not been moved since it was installed in July 2008.

A plaque located at the north-west side of the sculpture reads:
<blockquote>
"Luminary <br>
Embraced from all sides, this beacon of energy and enlightenment serves as the IU Simon Cancer Center's cornerstone.  The central sphere is constructed of onyx-credited by some with the power to increase regeneration and foster new recognition of personal strengths.<br>
Jeff Laramore 2nd Globe Studios      -2008-"
</blockquote>

The hospital contacted design firm, [http://2ndglobe.com 2nd Globe Studios], with studios in Indianapolis and Vancouver, BC, to start development on this sculpture and other pieces of art inside the IU Simon Cancer Center in 2004. Lead by principal designer and 2nd Globe Studio co-founder Jeff Laramore, the firm submitted design intention documents in August 2005.  Local companies were contracted to supply the materials and fabrication.  2nd Globe staff assembled the sphere's super-structure, an acrylic globe with internal supports and lighting attachments.  The Santarossa Mosaic and Tile Company (http://www.santarossa.com/idex.htm) of Indianapolis supplied the selected onyx stone, cutting each piece, applying the stones to the sphere and then grinding, polishing and installing the sphere on site.  Scenic View, Inc. of Chicago fabricated the curved walls under the artist's direction.  The center piece of the sculpture, the stone sphere, was installed in August 2008.<ref name="Smith, Renee 2009">Smith, Renee. Personal Interview. 24 Nov. 2009.</ref>

===Influences===
Prior to the IU Simon Cancer Center building<U+2019>s groundbreaking in 2005, focus teams collected the thoughts and desires of patients and caregivers specific to cancer care. These teams met monthly and consisted of 20-25 patients, family members, and staff members who were cancer survivors.  The focus teams started with the interior artwork of the building and then concentrated on exterior design in the courtyards.  The team leaders used design images from magazines to evoke color, texture, and emotion. Key inspirations gleaned from those discussions identified the power of nature as an affirmation of life, where light inspires hope and meditative space brings peace and nurturing.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cancer.iu.edu/media/fact_sheets/FactSheet4  |title=Inside: A Healing Environment|author= Schug, Michael|year=2008 |work= |publisher=IU Simon Cancer Center|accessdate= November 30, 2009 }}</ref>  The '''''Luminary''''' sculpture was designed to represent this spirit of hope, a spherical design that represented an eternal flame and the light glowing within each person.<ref name="Smith, Renee 2009"/>
