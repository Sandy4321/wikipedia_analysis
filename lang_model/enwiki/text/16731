The '''[[A1 road|A1]] in [[London]]''' is an [[A road]] in [[North London]].  It runs from the [[London Wall]] to [[Bignall's Corner]], where it crosses the M25 and becomes the [[A1(M) motorway]], continuing to [[Edinburgh]]. (For the road outside London, see the main [[A1 road]] article.) The London section passes through 4 [[London borough|London Boroughs]]: the [[City of London]], [[London Borough of Islington|Islington]], [[London Borough of Haringey|Haringey]] and [[London Borough of Barnet|Barnet]]. Whilst the route of the A1 outside London closely follows the historic route of the [[A1 road|Great North Road]], the London section for the most part does not.

The current route of the London section of the A1 road was (for the most part) designated as such in [[1927]]. It comprises a number of historic streets in central London and the former suburbs of [[Islington]], [[Holloway]] and [[Highgate]] and long stretches of purpose-built new roads in the outer London borough of [[London Borough of Barnet|Barnet]], built to divert traffic away from the congested suburbs of [[Finchley]] and [[High Barnet]].

The London section of the A1 is one of London's most important roads. It links North London to the [[M1 motorway]] and the [[A1 road|A1 (M) motorway]], and consequently serves as Central London's primary road transport artery to the [[Midlands]], [[Northern England]] and [[Scotland]]. It also connects a number of major areas within London, and sections of it serve as the [[High Street]] for many of the now-joined villages that make up north London. 

==St John Street (historic)==
[[Image:St John Street London.jpg|thumb|left|150px|St John Street, north end.<!-- This thumbnail size is deliberately forced to prevent the image overlapping into following sections at large sizes. See [[Talk:A1 road (London)#Forced image sizing]] -->]]
'''St John Street''' was the original start of the ''Great North Road'' and initially formed part of the A1; however, it no longer forms part of the present route, which runs some way to the east. It is a well-known [[London]] street, located in [[Clerkenwell]], [[Islington]]. It runs from [[Smithfield Market]] and Charterhouse Street in the south to the junction of [[City Road]] and [[Pentonville Road]] (near [[Upper Street]]) in the north, close to the [[Angel tube station]]. It is the first section of the original route of the Great North Road.

The [[Red Bull Theatre]] was located on the street between 1604 and 1666, when it was destroyed in the [[Great Fire of London]].
[[James Burnett, Lord Monboddo]] (1714<U+2013>1799) lived at 13 St John Street. He held "learned suppers" at his house, with guests including [[James Boswell]], [[Robert Burns]] and [[Samuel Johnson]].

Nowadays there are many office buildings, restaurants and bars.

See [[Talk:A1 road (London)#Forced image sizing]] -->]]

==Aldersgate Street==
The site of the now-demolished [[Aldersgate]] in the [[London Wall]], next to the [[Museum of London]], is the present start of the A1. '''Aldersgate Street''' runs north from here to the northern border of the [[City of London]], where it becomes Goswell Road.

Adjacent to the modern [[roundabout]] on the site of the Aldersgate is the former headquarters of the [[Post Office (United Kingdom)|General Post Office]] (closed in [[1910]] and demolished shortly afterwards), and the adjoining [[Postman's Park]]. The southern part of the roundabout and the northern part of the Post Office site stand on the site of a [[collegiate church]] and [[sanctuary]] founded in [[750]] by [[Withu]], [[Kingdom of Kent|King of Kent]], hugely expanded in [[1056]] by [[Ingebrian]], Earl of [[Essex]] and issued with a [[Royal Charter]] in [[1068]] by [[William I of England|William the Conqueror]]. The site of the church was cleared in [[1818]] in preparation for the construction of the Post Office<ref>{{cite journal

The poet [[Thomas Flatman]] was born in a house in Aldersgate Street in [[1633]]. As with most historic buildings on this stretch of road, the building no longer stands.

Although the building was very close to the nearby [[Fortune Playhouse]], there is no documentary evidence surviving to indicate that Shakespeare resided here; a subsidy roll from 1598 shows a "William Shakespeare" as owner of the property, but there is nothing to indicate that it is the playwright. The building no longer exists, and [[Barbican tube station]] now occupies the site. The nearby [[Shakespeare Tower]] is named for this (tenuous) connection.

Barbican tube station was originally named "Aldersgate Street" when it opened in [[1865]]. It was renamed "Aldersgate" in 1910, "Aldersgate and Barbican" in 1923, and "Barbican" in 1968<ref>{{cite web

===John Wesley===

See [[Talk:A1 road (London)#Forced image sizing]] -->]]In May [[1738]] clergyman [[John Wesley]] attended a meeting of the [[Moravian Church|Moravians]] in Aldersgate Street. While attending the meeting, he underwent a profound religious experience, describing it in his journal thus:
:<font face="Trebuchet MS">''"In the evening I went unwillingly to a society in Aldersgate Street, where one was reading Luther's preface to the Epistle to the Romans. About a quarter to nine, while he was describing the change which God works in the heart through faith in Christ, I felt my heart strangely warmed. I felt I did trust in Christ, Christ alone for salvation, and an assurance was given me that he had taken away my sins, even mine and saved me from the law of sin and death."''</font><ref>{{cite web

This moment was for Wesley an awakening to the assurance found in salvation by grace alone and has been referred to by scholars as a defining moment in the Methodist movement. 

In [[1739]] Wesley broke with the Moravians and founded the [[Methodism|Methodist Society of England]]. In the following years, the Methodist church spread rapidly, becoming one of the most influential Christian denominations in the world, particularly in the [[United States]] and the [[British Empire]]. A memorial at the believed site of the Moravian chapel (its exact address is not known, but it is believed to have been at 28 Aldersgate Street) marks the site of the meeting, and [[Wesley's Chapel]] in nearby [[City Road]] remains a major focal point of the international Methodist movement.

==Goswell Road==
'''Goswell Road''' is a road in the south of the [[London Borough of Islington]]. It runs north from the border of the [[City of London]] to [[The Angel, Islington|The Angel]]. There is dispute over the origins of the name, with some sources claiming the road was named after a nearby garden called 'Goswelle' or 'Goderell' which belonged to [[Robert de Ufford, 1st Earl of Suffolk]]<ref>{{cite web

===The Dame Alice Owen's School bombing===
On [[15 October]] [[1940]], approximately 150 people were sheltering in the [[basement]] of [[Dame Alice Owen's School]], then situated on Goswell Road. A large [[parachute]] [[Bomb#Delivery|bomb]] hit the building directly, causing the structure to collapse and blocking access to the basement.

==Islington High Street==
'''Islington High Street''' is, as the name suggests, the former [[High Street]] of the village of [[Islington]], now completely subsumed by London. Whilst Islington High Street is a relatively long road, only a very short section between [[City Road]] and [[Liverpool Road]] is designated as part of the A1.

The earliest reference to Islington High Street is its appearance on a 1590 map of the area. At this time, nine [[inn]]s (including the famous [[The Angel, Islington|Angel]], which has subsequently given its name to the area), as well as housing and a public pond were shown lining the street<ref>{{cite journal

In [[1716]] Islington High Street came under the control of the newly-formed Islington Turnpike Trust. The Trust grew rapidly, and soon had control of most major roads in the area, building a number of major road arteries through the expanding residential areas, including [[Caledonian Road]], [[Euston Road]], [[City Road]] and [[New North Road]]<ref>{{cite journal

===Places of interest on Upper Street===
[[Image:Upper Street high pavement.JPG|thumb|195px|left|High pavement, Upper Street.<!-- This thumbnail size is deliberately forced to prevent the caption word-wrapping excessively. See [[Talk:A1 road (London)#Forced image sizing]] -->]]Upper Street houses Islington [[Town Hall]], and the adjacent [[Islington Museum]]. It also contains the [[Hope and Anchor, Islington|Hope and Anchor]], formerly one of the most important [[Music venue|venues]] of the 1970s and 80s [[Punk rock|punk]] and [[New Wave music|new wave]] scenes, hosting performances by [[Madness (band)|Madness]], [[U2]] and [[Spandau Ballet]], among others (and [[Shakin' Stevens]]).

Upper Street is unusual in being one of the few streets in London (along with adjoining [[Liverpool Road]]) to have a "high pavement". This was constructed to protect pedestrians from being splashed by the large numbers of animals using the road to reach the Royal Agricultural Hall; as a consequence, the [[Sidewalk|pavement]] of the street is approximately 1m above the road surface for much of the length of the street<ref>{{cite web

In [[2005]] [[London Borough of Islington|Islington Council]] launched "Technology Mile", a project to turn Upper Street in a large scale [[Hotspot (Wi-Fi)|wi-fi hotspot]]. Using routers mounted on lampposts anyone with a wireless enabled device can connect to Council services and the internet the entire length of Upper Street, although the best signal is found in the [[Islington Green]]/St. Mary's church areas.

===Upper Street and the radical left===
In the 1970s & 80s Upper Street was a focal point of the [[Far left|radical left]]. It was home to Sisterwrite, Britain's first [[feminist]] [[bookshop]], as well as the [[Trotskyist]] Pioneer Books, the [[anarchist]] Rising Free shop (famous for stealing stock from other shops to sell in theirs) and the socialist Red Books<ref>{{cite web

After reaching the eight-way [[Highbury Corner]] interchange, the A1 turns north-west as '''Holloway Road'''. The origins of the name are disputed; some believe that it derives from [[Valley#Hollows|Hollow]] due to the dip in the road, whilst some believe it derives from [[Hallow]] and refers to the road's historic significance as part of the [[pilgrimage]] route to [[Walsingham]]. No documentary evidence can be found to support either derivation.

Holloway Road is one of north London's most important shopping streets, containing major [[Waitrose]], [[Morrisons]], [[Marks & Spencer]], [[Sainsbury's]], [[James Selby]] and [[Argos (retailer)|Argos]] stores as well as numerous smaller shops. Holloway Road is the site of the main campus of the much-renamed [[London Metropolitan University]] (formerly '''Northern Polytechnic Institute''', '''Polytechnic of North London''' and '''University of North London''')<ref>{{cite web

The earliest record giving the name of the road as The Holloway dates from [[1307]]. The main stretch of Holloway Road runs through the site of the villages of Tollington and Stroud. The exact time of their founding is not known, but the earliest record of them dates from [[1000]]. The names ceased to be used by the late [[17th Century]], but are still preserved in the local place names "Tollington Park" and "Stroud Green"<ref>{{cite journal

The northern point of Holloway Road is the complex interchange at [[Archway, London|Archway]], where the A1 leaves the historic route of the Great North Road. The traditional Great North Road heads northeast up [[Highgate Hill]] (now the B519) before turning north at [[Highgate]] to cross the current A1 route. The A1 heads north along the relatively recently built Archway Road. The construction of the interchange left a few buildings isolated in the centre of the [[roundabout]], including the [[Archway Tavern]], made famous on the cover of [[The Kinks]]' 1971 album ''[[Muswell Hillbillies]]''<ref>{{Citation

===Churches===
Holloway Road contains two significant London churches. [[St Mary Magdalene Church, Holloway Road|St Mary Magdalene]] is situated in [[St Mary Magdalene Gardens]] near the southern end of the road. Built by [[William Wickings]] in [[1814]], it is one of the best preserved early 19th century churches in London<ref>{{cite web

===Holloway Road in popular culture===
[[Record producer]] [[Joe Meek]], responsible amongst other things for ''Telstar'' by [[The Tornados]], a massive UK and US no. 1 record in 1962, and the highly influential [[1959]] album [[I Hear a New World]], lived, worked, and committed suicide at 304 Holloway Road<ref>{{cite web

===Railway stations on Holloway Road===
As one of London's primary transport routes during the [[19th Century]] railway boom, Holloway Road contains a number of railway stations.

Highbury Corner is the site of [[Highbury & Islington station]], one of London's most important transport interchanges. The [[Victoria Line]], [[Great Northern & City Railway]] (now part of [[First Capital Connect]]) and [[North London Line]] converge at this location. From [[2010]] it will also be the northern terminus of the [[East London Line]]<ref>{{cite web

[[Archway tube station]] is not actually situated on Holloway Road, but approximately 10m off the main road on [[Junction Road]], underneath the architecturally striking [[Archway Tower]]. Originally known as "Highgate", it was the original northern terminus of the [[Charing Cross, Euston & Hampstead Railway]] and until 1940 was the northern terminus of the [[Northern Line]].

==Archway Road==

After the Archway roundabout, the A1 veers away from the historic Great North Road route into a cutting, and becomes '''Archway Road'''. 

The traditional Great North Road at this point heads up a very steep hill to the village of [[Highgate]] before passing back down on the northern side. By the early [[19th Century]], this was proving unsuitable for increasingly heavy traffic, and the new Archway Road, crossing the hill at a shallower [[gradient]], was authorised in [[1910]], financed by [[Toll road|tolls]]. The tolls were abolished in [[1876]] and traffic increased substantially thereafter, particularly after the introduction of [[tram]]s on the road<ref>{{cite journal

The road passes north in [[Cutting (transportation)|cutting]] in a short [[dual carriageway]] through Highgate Hill and under [[Suicide Bridge (London)|Suicide Bridge]], before narrowing back to a [[single carriageway]] and passing through the eastern end of [[London Borough of Haringey|Haringey]]. It then veers northeast, crossing the original route of the Great North Road at a point just west of [[Highgate Wood]].

With the influx of [[Jews]] to London in the early [[20th Century]], Archway Road became a focal point of London's Jewish community. [[Highgate Synagogue]] opened in [[1930]] at 88 Archway Road, and moved to 200 Archway Road in [[1950]]<ref>{{cite journal

===Suicide Bridge===
[[Image:Archway shops.jpg|thumb|Shops on Archway Road.]]During [[Thomas Telford]]'s construction of Archway Road, it was originally intended that it would pass through Highgate Hill in [[tunnel]]. However, the tunnel collapsed, leaving an inadvertent [[Cutting (transportation)|cutting]] through the hill.

Accessible from the Archway Road level by a steep flight of steps, Suicide Bridge, as one of the highest points in London, offers impressive views over London and is a popular spot for photographers.

Suicide Bridge marks the boundary between [[London Borough of Islington|Islington]] and [[London Borough of Haringey|Haringey]], and consequently the official boundary between [[Inner London]] and [[Outer London]]. Although technically the boundary runs down the centre of the bridge, in practice the bridge is treated as part of Haringey and the land beneath it as part of Islington. For historic reasons, the bridge itself is owned and maintained by the [[Corporation of London]].

Although [[Highgate tube station]] is today a minor stop on the [[Northern Line]], under the "Northern Heights" project, part of the [[New Works Programme]] of the 1930s, it was to have become a major transport interchange. Lines from multiple directions were to have converged on the station; from the [[City of London|City]] and [[West End of London|West End]] via the twin spines of the [[Northern Line]]; to [[High Barnet]] and [[Bushey Heath]] via [[Finchley]] on converted [[Edgware, Highgate and London Railway]] lines; to [[Moorgate]] via [[Finsbury Park]] on the converted [[Great Northern & City Railway]] and to [[Alexandra Palace]] on the former [[Muswell Hill Railway]] line<ref>{{cite book

In 1941 the plans were abandoned due to wartime restrictions and to a lack of storage space for the new trains, following the conversion of the train depot at [[Aldenham]] into an aircraft factory, and the new lines never opened. Only the low-level Northern Line station is in use; however, [[Charles Holden]]'s abandoned & derelict high-level interchange station remains standing and can be seen from the footpath parallel to Archway Road leading north from the station entrance<ref>{{cite book

[[Image:A1-A1000 junction.JPG|thumb|260px|right|The A1 (left) turns sharply west as Aylmer Road, away from the original [[Great North Road]] (right, now the [[A1000 road|A1000]]), at the northern end of Archway Road.<!-- This thumbnail size is deliberately forced to prevent the caption word-wrapping excessively. See [[Talk:A1 road (London)#Forced image sizing]] -->]]
At the northern end of Archway Road, the road re-intersects with the traditional Great North Road route (at this point called "North Hill"). The roads almost immediately re-diverge, with the Great North Road route heading north as the [[A1000 road|A1000]] towards [[Finchley]], [[Whetstone, London|Whetstone]] and [[Barnet]] and the A1 heading west as '''Aylmer Road'''.

Aylmer Road is a very short stretch of road, running east for less than half a mile between the junction with the A1000 in [[London Borough of Haringey|Haringey]] to the junction with [[The Bishop's Avenue]] in [[London Borough of Barnet|Barnet]], where it turns northwest and becomes Lyttelton Road.

===The Bishop's Avenue===
Immediately before becoming Lyttelton Road, Aylmer Road crosses The Bishop's Avenue. As with much of the surrounding area, this land was owned by the [[Bishop of London]] following a land grant in [[704]]. In [[1894]], the Church let building plots for construction of homes on the road. In the [[20th Century]] much of the land was sold by the Church, which now only owns one house on the road (46 The Bishop's Avenue) and a nearby [[Assisted living|residential home]]<ref>{{cite journal

==Lyttelton Road==
After crossing the Bishop's Avenue, the A1 becomes '''Lyttelton Road'''. Lyttelton Road was built in [[1931]] in an attempt to divert traffic away from the congested suburb of [[Finchley]]<ref name="character"/>, and runs east-west along the northern foot of [[Highgate Hill]] between [[Hampstead Garden Suburb]] and [[East Finchley]].

Lyttelton Road is for the most part a nondescript residential road, characterised by large [[Single-family detached home|detached houses]] built with the road in the 1930s<ref>{{cite web

Due to high traffic on the road and consequent noise and pollution, the houses are set much further back from the road than is typical for English housing, leading to extremely wide pavements and verges in addition to large front gardens. House prices are far lower than on surrounding streets, with houses typically selling for around a tenth of the price of similarly-sized homes on the adjoining The Bishop's Avenue & Winnington Road<ref>{{cite web

[[Image:Market Place, N2.JPG|thumb|right|Market Place]]
==Market Place==
After passing playing fields to the south, Lyttelton Road crosses Kingsley Way and becomes '''Market Place'''. 

As the name suggests, Market Place was formerly the site of a street market. Whilst no trace of the market now remains other than the name, this short stretch of road is still an important shopping district and the site of the local [[post office]] and [[library]].

==Falloden Way==
[[Image:Verge of Falloden Road from Mutton Brook.JPG|thumb|200px|left|[[Sambucus nigra|Black elder]] growing on the banks of the verge carrying Falloden Way, near Henly's Corner.<!-- This thumbnail size is deliberately forced to prevent the caption word-wrapping excessively. See [[Talk:A1 road (London)#Forced image sizing]] -->]]
Immediately west of Market Place the A1 becomes '''Falloden Way''', which runs west before turning northwest and converging with the [[A406 road|North Circular Road]].

Falloden Way was built between 1914 as part of a programme of planned extensions to [[Hampstead Garden Suburb]]<ref>{{cite web

The north side of the road is occupied by 1930s housing blocks, whilst the southern side is occupied by a narrow strip of parkland following the brook, and by the northern tip of Big Wood & Little Wood (see below).

Falloden Way is a notoriously dangerous stretch of road. The layout of [[bus stop]]s and misunderstanding/ignoring of rules regarding their use means [[bus]]es are often forced to turn sharply out of the stops into fast moving traffic or to stop short of the bus stops presenting a hazard to other drivers<ref>{{Citation

===Henly's Corner===
The western end of Falloden Way is dominated by the complicated Henly's Corner interchange. The [[A406 road|A406]] runs from the northeast to converge with the A1 from the southeast. The roads run [[concurrency (road)|concurrently]] to a junction with the [[A598 road|A598]] north-south road, known as [[Finchley Road]] to the south of the junction and [[Regents Park Road]] to the north (confusingly, as the road is nowhere near [[Regents Park]]). The roads continue as a concurrency to the west, past the enormous [[Finchley Synagogue]] before diverging; the A406 turns sharply south to parallel [[Dollis Brook]] to [[Brent Cross]], while the A1 turns northwest as Great North Way. Seven smaller roads also meet the A1 along the Henly's Corner stretch of road, while a complex system of [[Subway (underpass)|subways]] beneath the interchange connect the various pedestrian footways.

Due to concerns about the safety of the underpasses, a number of people prefer to cross at surface level, leading to a number of serious road traffic accidents at the junction. There has been a sustained campaign in recent years to replace the subways with [[pedestrian crossing]]s<ref>{{cite web

===Big Wood & Little Wood===
Immediately south of Falloden Way are twin patches of woodland known as '''Big Wood''' and '''Little Wood'''. They are two of the few surviving remnants of the [[ancient woodland]] that once covered what is now north London. Big Wood covers a little over 7 hectares (70,000m<U+00B2>) while Little Wood covers around 2 hectares (20,000m<U+00B2>).

In [[704]] [[Wealdheri]], [[Bishop of London]] was granted the land in the area by [[Tyrhtel]], [[Bishop of Hereford]]. From the [[8th Century]] until [[1933]] the land continued to belong to the Bishop of London, the western edge of Big Wood marking the edge of the estate. At the time of the [[Domesday Book]], the land was noted as being "capable of supporting 1000 pigs"<ref name="colingregory">{{cite web

Over the years the forest was gradually cleared, leaving twin patches of isolated woodland. The exact dates are not known, but it is known that Big Wood and Little Wood were separated by fields by [[1767]].

[[Image:Big Wood, N2.JPG|thumb|285px|right|Big Wood]]
In [[1907]], the woods became surrounded by the newly-built town of [[Hampstead Garden Suburb]]. Ownership of the land was ceded by the Bishop of London to the newly created [[Municipal Borough of Finchley]] in 1933, which in [[1965]] passed to its successor, the [[London Borough of Barnet]]<ref>{{cite book

Big Wood is dominated by large [[oak]] trees. It also contains one of London's highest concentrations of [[Wild Service Tree]]s, while the undergrowth is dominated by [[Ivy]], [[Yellow Archangel]], [[Common Bluebell]] and [[Viburnum opulus|Guelder Rose]]. As a relatively isolated patch of woodland, it attracts large numbers of birds now rarely seen in the rest of London, particularly [[Owl]]s and [[Green Woodpecker]]s<ref>{{cite web

The nearby Park Farm, on the opposite side of Falloden Way, was owned by [[circus]] proprietor "Lord" George Sanger between [[1904]] and Sanger's murder in [[1911]]. Prior to the construction of the Denman's Drive housing on the field between Little and Big Woods, the field was used for grazing elephants<ref name="colingregory"/>.

Big Wood was declared a [[Local Nature Reserve]] in [[1999]], and is currently owned and managed by [[London Borough of Barnet|Barnet Council]].

After the Henly's Corner interchange, the A1 turns northwest as '''Great North Way'''.

The Copthall Sports Centre complex includes a large [[running]] [[stadium]], a number of [[tennis court]]s, the ground of Hendon [[Rugby union|RFC]], a full [[golf course]], a [[Powerleague]] centre and, unusually, a large [[cemetery]]<ref>{{cite web

==Watford Way==<!-- This section is linked from [[Watford Way]] -->
After passing the Copthall complex, the A1 meets the [[M1 motorway]] at [[Fiveways Corner]]. As most traffic leaves the A1 at this point to join the motorway, the road narrows north of this point. Immediately after passing Fiveways Corner, the A1 turns sharply north under the name of '''Watford Way'''.

Watford Way itself actually runs northwards from [[Brent Cross]], well to the south. However, that section south of Fiveways Corner is designated as part of the [[A41 road|A41]] and is not part of the A1. Between Fiveways Corner and Apex Corner (see below) the A1 and A41 [[overlap (road)|overlap]]<ref>{{cite book

As the stretch of Watford Way north of Fiveways Corner was built as a [[Bypass (road)|bypass]], and is also very close to the noisy and polluting M1, there is very little construction along this stretch of road.

==Apex Corner==<!-- This section is linked from [[Apex Corner]] -->
At the northern end of Watford Way is the large '''Apex Corner''' [[roundabout]]. The A1 and A41 separate, with the A1 turning to run straight north and the A41 turning west, while Selvage Lane runs southwest to [[Mill Hill]] and Marsh Lane runs northeast to [[Totteridge]]. Although Apex Corner is adjacent to the M1, there is no interchange with the motorway.

As the [[Parking lot|car parks]] of shops at Apex Corner overlook the [[Midland Main Line]], the location is extremely popular with [[Railfan#Trainspotting|trainspotters]]<ref>{{cite web

==Barnet Way/Barnet Bypass==<!-- This section is linked from [[Barnet Way]] -->
After passing Apex Corner, the A1 runs north and out of London as '''Barnet Way''' (also known as '''Barnet Bypass'''), built in the 1920s to divert traffic away from [[Barnet]]. Although not technically a motorway at this point, the road runs as dual carriageway throughout and is treated as a motorway for most purposes.

After passing Scratchwood (see below), the A1 heads north, skirting the towns of Barnet and [[Elstree]], before turning northeast and running through open [[countryside]] to Bignell's Corner.

The "[[Thatched Barn]]" on the Barnet Bypass is reported to have been a secret [[Special Operations Executive]] base during [[World War II]]<ref>{{cite web

The Barnet Bypass was also the location of the last [[Metropolitan Police Service|Metropolitan Police]] [[Police box]] in use (prior to the reintroduction of a single new box in [[Earl's Court]] in 1996)<ref>{{cite web

===Moat Mount & Scratchwood===
Just north of Apex Corner, the road passes the 140 acre (570,000m<U+00B2>) [[Moat Mount]] open space on the east of the A1. This large [[Victorian era|Victorian]] park is a popular [[camping]] and walking spot for north Londoners<ref>{{cite web

On the western side of the A1 opposite Moat Mount is the [[ancient forest]] of [[Scratchwood]]. In recent years, Scratchwood [[Rest area|Service Station]] and the surrounding forest has become a popular spot for [[Dogging (sexual slang)|dogging]]<ref>{{Citation

==Bignell's Corner==
At '''Bignell's Corner''' the A1 meets the [[M25 motorway]] at a large roundabout. North of Bignell's Corner the A1 becomes the A1(M) [[motorway]], and rejoins the historic Great North Road route, running north to [[Edinburgh]]. For information on the A1 outside of London, see the main [[A1 road]] article.
