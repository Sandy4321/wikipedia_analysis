'''Clare Grant Stevenson''' [[Order of Australia|AM]], [[Order of the British Empire|MBE]] (18 July 1903 &ndash; 22 October 1988) was the inaugural Director of the [[Women's Auxiliary Australian Air Force]] (WAAAF). As such, she has been described as "the most significant woman in the history of the Air Force".<ref>Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', p.155</ref> Formed as a branch of the [[Royal Australian Air Force]] (RAAF) in 1941, the WAAAF was the first and largest uniformed women's service in Australia during [[World War II]], numbering more than 18,000 members by late 1944 and making up over 30 per cent of RAAF ground staff. 

Born and educated in [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], Stevenson was an executive with the [[Berlei]] company when she was appointed Director of the WAAAF. Initially ranked [[Squadron Leader|Squadron Officer]], she rose to become a [[Group Captain|Group Officer]] by 1942.  Stevenson resumed her civilian career following her discharge from the Air Force in 1946. Long active in social welfare, she helped form aid organisations in New South Wales after retiring from Berlei in 1960. Stevenson was appointed a [[Order of the British Empire|Member of the Order of the British Empire]] and a [[Order of Australia|Member of the Order of Australia]] for her services to the community and to female veterans.

==Education and early career==
Born in [[Wangaratta, Victoria|Wangaratta]], [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], Clare Stevenson was the second youngest of six children. When she was four her family moved to [[Essendon, Victoria|Essendon]], where she attended [[Lowther Hall Anglican Grammar School|Winstow Girls' Grammar School]] and Essendon High School,<ref name="NFAW">[http://www.womenaustralia.info/biogs/AWE0399b.htm Stevenson, Clare Grant (1903 - 1988)] at [http://nfaw.org/women-s-history/ National Foundation for Australian Women]. Retrieved on 10 January 2009.</ref> completing her intermediate and leaving certificates.<ref name="High Fliers">Stephens & Isaacs, ''High Fliers'', pp.76&ndash;79</ref> She was admitted to the Faculty of Science at the [[University of Melbourne]], but switched to education after failing [[chemistry]].<ref name="AWM">[http://www.awm.gov.au/people/320.asp Group Officer Clare Grant Stevenson] at [[Australian War Memorial]]. Retrieved on 9 January 2009.</ref> A [[Field hockey|hockey]] [[Blue (university sport)|blue]], Stevenson was active in a number of campus groups, including the Students' Representative Council and the Science Club. She became President of the Committee of Melbourne University Women, and graduated in 1925 with a [[Diploma of Education]].<ref name="NFAW"/>

Stevenson commenced work with the [[World YWCA|YWCA]] in 1926, becoming General Secretary of the [[Rockhampton, Queensland|Rockhampton]] branch from 1929 to 1931.<ref name="NFAW"/><ref name="Gillison">Gillison, [http://www.awm.gov.au/cms_images/histories/26/chapters/05.pdf ''Royal Australian Air Force 1939<U+2013>1942'', pp.99&ndash;100]</ref>  In 1932 she took up a position as a training and research officer at [[Berlei]], and from 1935 to 1939 represented the company in [[London]] as a senior executive.<ref name="AWM"/> She was based in [[Sydney]] when [[World War II]] broke out, in charge of product research and the training of sales staff. Late in 1940, Stevenson was nominated to be Director of the planned [[Women's Auxiliary Australian Air Force]] (WAAAF).<ref name="High Fliers"/> Although keen to serve the war effort in some capacity, she demurred due to the administrative and social obstacles she foresaw. However her appointment went ahead on 21 May 1941, with effect from 9 June.<ref name="The WAAAF in Wartime Australia"/> 
The Air Member for Personnel, [[Air Vice Marshal]] Henry Wrigley, had recommended Stevenson on the basis of her management background and because she was not a "socialite".<ref name="Dennis">Dennis et al, ''The Oxford Companion to Australian Military History'', p.606</ref>

==Director of WAAAF==
[[Image:VIC1369Stevenson1941.jpg<U+200E>|thumb|left|Wing Officer Stevenson (front row, second left) with staff at No. 1 WAAAF Depot, Victoria, 1941]]
The WAAAF, formally established on 25 March 1941, comprised 206 personnel when Stevenson took over.<ref name="Gillison"/><ref name="The WAAAF in Wartime Australia">Thomson, ''The WAAAF in Wartime Australia'', p.338</ref> Established in response to lobbying by women to help serve the war effort, and to free more male ground crew for overseas postings, it was the first service of its kind in Australia.<ref name="AWM"/> From the outset, Stevenson had to deal with discrimination by government authorities, many of whom had been against the creation of such a service. One-time [[Minister for Defence (Australia)|Minister for Defence]], [[Harold Thorby]], declared that "aviation takes women out of their natural environment, the home and the training of the family".<ref name="High Fliers"/> WAAAF staff were paid two-thirds of what a male doing the equivalent trade received, while their right of appeal in disciplinary matters and the deference shown to their rank was more comparable to that of "uniformed civilians" than to servicemen.<ref>Thomson, ''The WAAAF in Wartime Australia'', p.71</ref> Women were at first enlisted for renewable 12-month periods rather than as permanant staff; only in 1943 did the WAAAF become part of the Permanent Air Force.<ref name="Dennis"/>   

Stevenson considered housing, uniforms, and training as her first priorities after taking up her appointment. She said that on arriving at No. 1 WAAAF Depot, [[Malvern, Victoria|Malvern]], she was "shattered at the prison-like atmosphere of the place".<ref>Thomson, ''The WAAAF in Wartime Australia'', p.100</ref> Stevenson was promoted to [[Wing Commander (rank)|Wing Officer]] in September 1941, and [[Group Captain|Group Officer]] in April 1942,<ref name="NFAW"/> which would be the highest rank attained by a serving WAAAF member.<ref>Thomson, ''The WAAAF in Wartime Australia'', p.334</ref> She took an active part in recruitment, her liberal social outlook evinced by a recommendation that single women with children should not be barred from entry to the WAAAF.<ref>Thomson, ''The WAAAF in Wartime Australia'', p.137</ref> Stevenson also worked to maintain the morale of personnel, encouraging officers to attend group leadership courses and organise leisure and sporting activities for their staff.<ref>Thomson, ''The WAAAF in Wartime Australia'', pp.290&ndash;291</ref> [[Lieutenant Colonel]] Sybil Irving, head of the [[Australian Women's Army Service]], later contended that Stevenson "did the most pertinent pioneering work" in gaining acceptance for women in the armed forces.<ref>Dennis et al, ''The Oxford Companion to Australian Military History'', p.513</ref>

Early in 1943 a policy change was mooted to remove female officers from the technical musterings they had so far filled in the WAAAF, and substitute male officers in these roles. In opposing this, Stevenson went around the new Air Member for Personnel, [[Air Commodore]] Frank Lukis, and wrote directly to the Deputy Chief of the Air Staff, Air Commodore [[John McCauley (RAAF officer)|John McCauley]]. She told McCauley, "I contend that it is a waste of money and training to take women [[cipher]] officers, women from Signals (S4) and casualty ... when they have learnt their work and substitute these women by men who have to learn the job", and recommended that he direct the Air Member for Personnel to ensure that female officers continued to be employed in technical positions, and not simply for administration and welfare. McCauley agreed with Stevenson but Lukis appealed to the [[Chief of Air Force (Australia)|Chief of the Air Staff]], [[Air Vice Marshal]] [[George Jones (RAAF officer)|George Jones]]. Jones backed Lukis' authority, and the latter sent a "stinging rebuke" to Stevenson, who was forced to apologise.<ref>Thomson, ''The WAAAF in Wartime Australia'', pp.218&ndash;219</ref> In the event, women officers continued to fill technical positions as the WAAAF expanded over the next two years, peaking in strength at 18,667 members in October 1944.<ref name="AWM"/><ref>Thomson, ''The WAAAF in Wartime Australia'', pp.219&ndash;221</ref> By the end of the war a total of 27,000 women had served in the WAAAF, comprising 31.5 per cent of Air Force ground staff.<ref name="High Fliers"/>

Stevenson continued to lead the WAAAF following the cessation of hostilities, retiring due to medical grounds on 18 March 1946.<ref name="The WAAAF in Wartime Australia"/> Suffering reduced muscle function in her left arm and upper body, she was diagnosed with [[neuritis|brachial neuritis]], traced to [[typhus]], [[tetanus]] and [[smallpox]] [[Vaccination|injections]] received the previous May in preparation for a proposed visit to [[Manila]].<ref>Thomson, ''The WAAAF in Wartime Australia'', pp.306&ndash;307</ref> The WAAAF itself, the first and largest of Australia's wartime women's services, was disbanded on 30 September 1946.<ref name="AWM"/><ref name="Stephens">Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', pp.203&ndash;205</ref> It was succeeded in 1950 by a new organisation separate to the RAAF, the [[Women's Royal Australian Air Force]] (WRAAF).<ref name="Stephens"/>

==Later life==
Following her discharge from the WAAAF, Stevenson resumed her career as a senior executive with Berlei, and remained with the company until her retirement in 1960.<ref name="AWM"/> Parallel to her work at Berlei, she was one of the Trustees of the Services Canteens Trust Fund in [[Melbourne]], maintaining her assocation for 40 years. Stevenson also helped set up the Scholarship Trust Fund for Civilian Widows' Children. She was appointed a [[Order of the British Empire|Member of the Order of the British Empire]] in the 1960 [[Queen's Birthday Honours]] for her "social welfare services on behalf of ex-service women".<ref>{{LondonGazette|issue=42052|startpage=4011|date=3 June 1960|accessyear=2009|accessdaymonth=9 January}}</ref> In 1975, Stevenson was involved in establishing the Kings Cross Community Aid and Information Service, serving for a time as its President and as a member of the Management Committee.<ref name="AWM"/>  

Stevenson founded the Carers Association of New South Wales, and became its first President, in 1980. As a Research Officer with the Council on the Ageing (COTA) in 1974, she had prepared a report on the levels of assistance given to the elderly by their family and friends. This led to her forming a subcommittee of COTA made up of those she called [[Caregiver|'carers']], from which the Carers Association was formed as an independent organisation.  Stevenson worked for the establishment of a Carers Pension in New South Wales, which was legislated in 1985. She is commemorated at the Carers Association (now Carers NSW) by the Clare Stevenson Memorial Lectures.<ref>[http://www.carersnsw.asn.au/storage/pdfs/cnswhistory.pdf Carers NSW 25 Years: 1975-2000, a retrospective] at [http://www.carersnsw.asn.au/ Carers NSW].

In 1984 Stevenson, together with Honor Darling, published ''The W.A.A.A.F. Book'', a collection of reminiscences by veterans of the service.<ref name="NFAW"/> She was appointed a [[Order of Australia|Member of the Order of Australia]] in the 1988 [[Orders, decorations, and medals of Australia|Australia Day Honours]] for "service to the community and to the welfare of veterans".<ref>[http://www.itsanhonour.gov.au/honours/honour_roll/search.cfm?aus_award_id=873383&search_type=quick&showInd=true Stevenson, Clare Grant: Member of the Order of Australia] at [http://www.itsanhonour.gov.au It's an Honour].
