{{main article|History of Hibernian F.C.}}
{{see also|Hibernian F.C. seasons}}

=== Foundation and early history ===
[[File:Cowgate, Edinburgh.JPG|right|thumb|upright|The [[Cowgate]], where Hibs were formed in 1875]]
The club were founded in 1875 by [[Irish people|Irish]]-born [[association football|football]] enthusiasts from the [[Cowgate]] area of [[Edinburgh]], who named it '''Hibernians Football Club''', which means "Irish Football Club". The name is derived from [[Hibernia]], the Roman name for Ireland.<ref name ="Origins"/> [[James Connolly]], the famous [[Irish republicanism|Irish Republican]] leader, was a Hibs fan during this period.<ref>Vallely, Joanna. [http://sport.scotsman.com/hibernianfc/God-squad-signs-up-to.2798179.jp God squad signs up to play host to Hibs past], ''[[Edinburgh Evening News]]'', 4 August 2003.<!--accessed 13 June 2008--></ref> There was some [[sectarian]] resistance initially to an Irish club participating in [[Football in Scotland|Scottish football]],<ref name ="Origins"/> but Hibs established themselves as a force in Scottish football in the 1880s. In 1887 they became the first club from the east coast of Scotland to win the [[Scottish Cup]] and they then defeated [[Preston North End F.C.|Preston North End]] in a match described as the ''[[Association Football]] Championship of the World Decider''.<ref>[http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/sport/football-news/2008/01/23/on-the-record-86908-20294852/ On The Record], ''[[Daily Record (Scotland)|Daily Record]]'', 23 January 2008.<!--accessed 13 June 2008--></ref>

Mismanagement over the next few years led to the demise of Hibernians, who became homeless and ceased operating during 1891. A reformed club called '''Hibernian''' was established and they acquired a [[lease]] on a site in late 1892 that was to become known as [[Easter Road]]. Hibernian played its first match at Easter Road on 4 February 1893.<ref name ="New Beginnings">Campbell, John. [http://www.hibs.co.uk/news/more.php?id=1447_0_1_0_C Origins of Hibernian - New Beginnings], Hibernian F.C. official site.<!--accessed 14 June 2008--></ref> Despite this interruption, the club today views Hibernians and Hibernian as one continued history and therefore counts the honours won by Hibernians, including the 1887 [[Scottish Cup]].<ref name = "Honours"/>

A significant change at the time of the club's reformation was that players were no longer required to be members of the Catholic Young Men's Society. Hibs are not seen today as being an Irish or [[Roman Catholic]] institution as it was in the early years of its history.<ref name = "forgotten Irish">Kelly, John. [http://www.informaworld.com/smpp/35861602-53459094/content~content=a778574287~db=ai~order=page Hibernian Football Club: The Forgotten Irish?], ''Informaworld'', May 2007.<!--accessed 14 June 2008--></ref> For instance, the [[Cl<U+00E0>rsach|Irish harp]] was only re-introduced to [[Graphic design|the club badge]] when it was last re-designed in 2000. This design reflects the three pillars of the club's identity - [[Ireland]], [[Edinburgh]] (the [[Edinburgh Castle|castle]]) and [[Leith]] (the [[ship]]). Geography rather than religion is now seen as the primary reason for supporting Hibs,<ref name = "Jewel"/> who draw most of their support from the north and east of [[Edinburgh]].<ref name = "Jewel">[[Graham Spiers|Spiers, Graham]]. [http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/sport/football/scotland/article2797038.ece Edinburgh derby is the jewel of game in Scotland], ''[[The Times]]'', 3 November 2007.<!--accessed 14 June 2008--></ref><ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/rugby_union/scottish/3148651.stm New capital groundshare plan], [[BBC Sport]], 13 August 2003.<!--accessed 14 June 2008--></ref>

Hibs had some success after being reformed, winning the [[Scottish Cup 1901<U+2013>02|1902 Scottish Cup]] and their first [[List of Scottish football champions|league championship]] a [[1902<U+2013>03 in Scottish football|year later]]. After this, however, the club endured a long barren spell until the [[Second World War]], failing to finish high in the league. The notorious Scottish Cup [[drought (sport)|drought]]<ref name = "Cup of woe"/> began as they reached three cup finals (two in consecutive years), but lost them all.

=== The Famous Five ===
[[File:Famous Five mural.JPG|right|thumb|upright|Picture depicting [[The Famous Five (football)|the Famous Five]] at [[Easter Road]] stadium]]
Hibs' most successful era by far was in the [[decade]] following the end of the Second World War. The [[Formation (football)#Classic formations|forward line]] of [[Gordon Smith (Hibernian)|Gordon Smith]], [[Bobby Johnstone]], [[Lawrie Reilly]], [[Eddie Turnbull]] and [[Willie Ormond]], collectively known as [[The Famous Five (football)|the Famous Five]], is regarded as being the best forward line in the history of [[Scottish football]].<ref name = "Bobby Johnstone">[http://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/bobby-johnstone-729354.html Bobby Johnstone], ''[[The Independent]]'', 24 August 2001.<!--accessed 14 June 2008--></ref> The quality of the Famous Five is shown by the fact that all five players are in the top six of Hibs' all-time goalscorer list,<ref name = "Bobby Johnstone"/> and [[Easter Road]]'s north stand is named in their honour.<ref name = "Our Legends - The Famous Five"/>

Of the five, only Ormond cost Hibs a transfer fee, <U+00A3>1200 from [[Stenhousemuir F.C.|Stenhousemuir]].<ref>[http://www.fatsandbald.freeuk.com/HallOfFame/FamousFive/WOrmond.htm Willie Ormond], ''Fats and Bald''.<!--accessed 15 June 2008--></ref> Reilly, Johnstone, Smith and Turnbull were signed from youth or junior leagues.<ref name = "Our Legends - The Famous Five">[http://www.hibs.co.uk/FamousFive.php Our Legends - The Famous Five], Hibernian F.C. official site.<!--accessed 14 June 2008--></ref> The first time Hibs used all five in the same team was on 21 April 1949 in a [[friendly match]] against [[Nithsdale Wanderers F.C.|Nithsdale Wanderers]].<ref name = "Our Legends - The Famous Five"/> The forward line remained in place until 1955, when Johnstone was sold to [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]]. The great forward line, together with players like [[Bobby Combe]] and [[Tommy Younger]], largely contributed to the winning of the league championships in [[1947<U+2013>48 in Scottish football|1948]], [[1950<U+2013>51 in Scottish football|1951]] and [[1951<U+2013>52 in Scottish football|1952]]. The team were perhaps unfortunate not to win more trophies, as they finished second to [[Rangers F.C.|Rangers]] in [[1952<U+2013>53 in Scottish football|1953]] on [[goal average]] and second to Rangers by a point in [[1949<U+2013>50 in Scottish football|1950]].

=== First British club in Europe ===
{{see also|Hibernian F.C. in Europe}}
Despite only finishing fifth in the Scottish League in [[1954<U+2013>55 in Scottish football|1955]], Hibs were invited to participate in the [[European Cup 1955<U+2013>56|first season of the European Cup]]. At that time the [[UEFA Champions League|European Cup]] was not strictly based on league position. 18 clubs who were thought would generate interest across Europe and who also had the [[Floodlights (sport)|floodlights]] necessary to play games at night were invited to participate.<ref name = "European Union">Wilson, Richard. [http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/sport/football/article545013.ece European Union], ''[[The Times]]'', 17 July 2005.<!--accessed 14 June 2008--></ref> Floodlights had been used at [[Easter Road]] for the first time in an [[Edinburgh derby]] [[friendly match]] against [[Heart of Midlothian F.C.|Heart of Midlothian]] on 18 October 1954.<ref>[http://www.londonhearts.com/scores/games/19541018.html Mon 18 Oct 1954], ''London Hearts''.<!--accessed 14 June 2008--></ref>

Hibs became the first ''[[Great Britain|British]]'' club in Europe because the [[Football League]] secretary [[Alan Hardaker]] persuaded the [[English football champions|English champions]] [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] not to enter the first season of the European Cup.<ref>[[Brian Glanville|Glanville, Brian]]. [http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/sport/football/european_football/article385542.ece The great Chelsea surrender], ''[[The Times]]'', 27 April 2005.<!--accessed 14 June 2008--></ref> In the [[European Cup 1956<U+2013>57|1956<U+2013>57 European Cup]], [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] became the first English club to appear in the European Cup.<ref>[http://www.europeancuphistory.com/euro57.html Season 1956<U+2013>57], ''European Cup History''.<!--accessed 14 June 2008--></ref>

Hibs played their first tie against [[Rot-Weiss Essen]], winning 4<U+2013>0 in the [[Georg-Melches-Stadion]]<ref name = "European Union"/> and drawing 1<U+2013>1 at Easter Road. They defeated [[Djurg<U+00E5>rdens IF Fotboll|Djurg<U+00E5>rdens IF]] to reach the semi-final,<ref name = "European Union"/> but in that tie they were defeated 3<U+2013>0 on [[Two-legged tie|aggregate]] by [[Stade Reims]],<ref name = "European Union"/> who had the famous [[France national football team|France international]] player [[Raymond Kopa]] in their side.<ref name = "European Union"/> Reims lost 4<U+2013>3 to [[Real Madrid C.F.|Real Madrid]] in [[1956 European Cup Final|the final]].<ref name = "European Union"/>

=== Turnbull's Tornadoes ===
Hibs frequently participated in European competition during the 1960s, famously winning ties against [[FC Barcelona|Barcelona]]<ref>Leslie, Colin. [http://sport.scotsman.com/hibernianfc/Kinloch-still-treasures-shot-at.4182599.jp Kinloch still treasures shot at glory], ''[[The Scotsman]]'', 13 June 2008.<!--access date = 15 June 2008.--></ref> and [[S.S.C. Napoli|Napoli]].<ref>[http://sport.scotsman.com/hibernianfc/Classic-Match-Hibs-5-.3907874.jp Classic Match: Hibs 5<U+2013>0 Napoli, 29 November 1967], ''[[Edinburgh Evening News]]'', 24 March 2008.<!--access date = 15 June 2008.--></ref> The club achieved little domestically, however, until former player [[Eddie Turnbull]] was persuaded to return to Easter Road as [[head coach|manager]] in 1971. The team popularly called ''Turnbull's Tornadoes'' finished second in the league [[1973<U+2013>74 in Scottish football|in 1974]] and [[1974<U+2013>75 in Scottish football|1975]], and won the [[Scottish League Cup|League Cup]] in [[1972<U+2013>73 in Scottish football|1972]]. The club also won the [[Drybrough Cup]] in 1972 and 1973, and recorded a 7<U+2013>0 win over [[Edinburgh derby]] rivals Hearts at [[Tynecastle]] on [[New Year's Day]] 1973.

After the mid-1970s, however, the team's performances went into decline as Hibs were replaced by the [[New Firm (Scotland)|New Firm]] of [[Aberdeen F.C.|Aberdeen]] and [[Dundee United F.C.|Dundee United]] as being the main challengers to the [[Old Firm]]. Turnbull resigned as manager and Hibs were [[promotion and relegation|relegated]] in [[1979<U+2013>80 in Scottish football|1980]]. They were immediately [[promotion and relegation|promoted]] back to the [[Scottish Premier League|top division]] in [[1980<U+2013>81 in Scottish football|the following season]], but the club struggled during the 1980s, failing to qualify for Europe until 1989.

=== Takeover bid by Hearts ===
{{see also|Wallace Mercer}}
After mismanagement during the late 1980s, Hibs were on the brink of financial ruin in 1990.<ref name = "merger memories">Murray, Scott. [http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2001/may/03/sport.comment Merger memories], ''[[The Guardian]]'', 3 May 2001.<!--accessed 15 June 2008--></ref> [[Wallace Mercer]], the [[chairman]] of [[Edinburgh derby]] rivals Hearts, proposed a [[merger]] of the two clubs,<ref name = "merger memories"/> which he believed would produce a club who could compete on a more even footing with the [[Old Firm]].<ref>[http://www.hibs.co.uk/Club_History.php Club History], {{fc|Hibernian}} official site.</ref> Hibs fans, however, believed that the proposed merger was more like a [[hostile takeover]], and they formed ''Hands off Hibs'' to campaign for the continued existence of the club.<ref>[http://www.scottishfa.co.uk/scottish_football.cfm?curpageid=417 Hands off Hibs], [[Scottish Football Association]] official site.<!--accessed 15 June 2008--></ref>

The campaign succeeded when a prominent local businessman, [[Kwik-Fit]] owner [[Sir]] [[Tom Farmer]], was persuaded to acquire a controlling interest in Hibs.<ref name ="Farmer content with Hibs backseat"/> The fans were able to persuade him to take control despite the fact he has no great interest in football.<ref name ="Farmer content with Hibs backseat"/> He has subsequently taken a "hands-off" approach to his ownership.<ref name ="Farmer content with Hibs backseat">[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/h/hibernian/6089742.stm Farmer content with Hibs backseat], [[BBC Sport]], 26 October 2006.<!--accessed 15 June 2008--></ref> Farmer was persuaded in part by the fact that an [[ancestor]] of his had been involved in the rescue of Hibs from financial ruin in the early 1890s.<ref name ="New Beginnings"/> After the attempted takeover by Mercer, Hibs had a few good years in the early 1990s, winning the [[Scottish League Cup|Skol Cup]] in [[1991<U+2013>92 in Scottish football|1991]] and finishing in the top five in the league between [[1992<U+2013>93 in Scottish football|1993]] and [[1994<U+2013>95 in Scottish football|1995]].

=== Recent history ===
==== McLeish ====
Soon after [[Alex McLeish]] was appointed as [[head coach|manager]], Hibs were [[Promotion and relegation|relegated]] to the [[Scottish Football League First Division|First Division]] at the end of the [[1997<U+2013>98 in Scottish football|1997<U+2013>98 season]].<ref>Buckland, Simon.

Hibs consolidated their position in the SPL [[Scottish Premier League 1999-2000|the following season by finishing sixth]]. Hibs then enjoyed a very good season in [[2000<U+2013>01 in Scottish football|2000<U+2013>01]], as they recorded six consecutive victories in August and challenged the Old Firm until Christmas, eventually [[Scottish Premier League 2000-01|finishing third in the league]]. Hibs also reached [[2001 Scottish Cup Final|the final]] of the Scottish Cup for the first time in 22 years, but lost 3<U+2013>0 to [[Celtic F.C.|Celtic]] at [[Hampden Park]].<ref name ="2001 Cup Final"/> Unfortunately, this meant that McLeish attracted interest from other clubs and he departed for Rangers in December 2001.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/r/rangers/1701609.stm Rangers unveil McLeish], [[BBC Sport]], 11 December 2001.<!--accessed 15 June 2008--></ref>

{{main article|Easter Road|Hibernian Park}}
Hibs played on [[The Meadows (park)|The Meadows]] for the first two years of their history,<ref>Lugton (1999), pp226-227.</ref> before moving to grounds in [[Newington, Edinburgh|Newington]] ([[Mayfield Park]])<ref>Lugton (1999), pp227-232.</ref> and Bonnington Road, [[Leith]] ([[Powderhall]])<ref>Lugton (1999), pp229-230.</ref> in different spells between 1877 and 1879. After the lease on Mayfield Park expired, Hibs moved to a ground known as [[Hibernian Park]],<ref>Lugton (1999), pp232.</ref> on what is now Bothwell Street in Leith. The club lost the lease on that ground, which contributed to the demise of the old Hibernians club.<ref>Lugton (1999), pp275.</ref> The new Hibernian club obtained a lease on a site just off [[Easter Road, Edinburgh|Easter Road]] in 1892 and have played their home matches at the [[Easter Road|Easter Road Stadium]] ever since.

Before the [[Taylor Report]] demanded that the stadium be all-seated, the ground had vast banks of terracing on three sides,<ref name ="Easter Road">[http://www.easterroad.com/ Hibernian Football Club (Hibs), Easter Road Stadium], www.easterroad.com</ref> which meant that it could hold crowds in excess of 60,000.

During the club's [[annual general meeting]] in September 2007, Hibs told their supporters that they would hold a consultation process on the redevelopment of the east side of the ground,<ref>[http://www.hibs.co.uk/news/more.php?id=2717_0_1_0_C Supporters views are vital], {{fc|Hibernian}} official site.</ref> which began during April 2008.<ref>[http://www.hibs.co.uk/news/more.php?id=2696_0_1_0_C East Stand Consultation], {{fc|Hibernian}} official site.</ref> Hibs have announced plans which would mean increasing the capacity of the stadium to just over 20,000.

Hibs' traditional [[derby match|local rivals]] in [[Edinburgh]] are [[Heart of Midlothian F.C.|Hearts]]. The [[Edinburgh derby]] is one of the oldest sporting rivalries in world football.<ref>[http://www.edinburgh-inspiringcapital.com/live/leisure/spectator_sports.aspx Spectator sports] ''Edinburgh - Inspiring Capital''</ref> [[Graham Spiers]] has described it as "one of the [[Gemstone|jewels]] of the [[Scottish football|Scottish game]]".<ref name = "Jewel"/> The clubs first met on Christmas Day 1875, when Hearts won 1<U+2013>0 in Hibs' first ever match. It wasn't until their five-game struggle for the [[East of Scotland Shield|Edinburgh Football Association Cup]] in 1878 that the two clubs became dominant in Edinburgh. Hearts won 3<U+2013>2 after 0<U+2013>0, 1<U+2013>1, 1<U+2013>1 and 1<U+2013>1 draws. The clubs' most notable meeting occurred in the [[1895<U+2013>96 in Scottish football|1896]] [[Scottish Cup]] final, which Hearts won 3<U+2013>1.

Both clubs have grounds with similar capacities and have both been [[List of Scottish football champions|champions of Scotland]] four times. Hearts have won more cup competitions and have the better record in derbies, with 269 wins to 195 in 604 matches.<ref>[http://www.londonhearts.com/scores/tea/hibernian.html Hibernian], ''London Hearts''.</ref> Approximately half of all derbies have been played in local competitions and [[friendly match|friendlies]]. Hibs recorded the biggest derby win in a competitive match when they won 7<U+2013>0 at [[Tynecastle]] on New Year's Day 1973, but the biggest winning margin in any derby was a 10<U+2013>2 Hearts victory in a [[friendly match]] played on 12 August 1893.

=== Literature ===
The works of author [[Irvine Welsh]], particularly ''[[Trainspotting (novel)|Trainspotting]]'', contain several references to Hibernian. The team is often mentioned in casual conversation and is the team many of his characters support. Visual references to Hibs are noticeable in [[Danny Boyle]]'s film adaption of Trainspotting.<ref>[http://www.guardian.co.uk/theobserver/1996/feb/04/featuresreview.review Would the real Irvine Welsh shoot up?], ''[[The Observer]]'', 4 February 1996.</ref> Begbie wears a Hibs shirt while he plays [[five-a-side football]]. During the famous baby-on-the-ceiling/detox scene, many [[poster]]s and [[Image|pictures]] of Hibernian can be seen on the walls of Mark Renton's [[bedroom]].

In the final short story of the trilogy ''[[The Acid House]]'', Coco Bryce, a boy from the "Hibs [[hooligan firm|firm]]", is struck by [[lightning]] while under the influence of [[LSD]] in a [[Pilton, Edinburgh|Pilton]] park. His soul is transferred to the body of an unborn child from one of the more affluent areas of Edinburgh.<ref>[http://www.bbc.co.uk/scotland/arts/writingscotland/writers/irvine_welsh/works.shtml BBC]</ref> The final scene of [[The Acid House (film)|the film adaptation]] of Welsh's work shows Coco in the baby's body strapped to his mother's back with a Hibs top in the pub chanting "'''Oo to, oo to be, oo to be a Hibee'''". In ''[[Marabou Stork Nightmares]]'', the main character, Roy Strang, hails from Leith and becomes a Hibs supporter, and then eventually becomes part of a Hibs [[hooligan firm|firm]].

Hibernian are also frequently referred to in the [[Inspector Rebus]] series of [[detective novels]] by [[Ian Rankin]]. Rebus himself is a [[Raith Rovers F.C.|Raith Rovers]] fan in the books,<ref>[http://www.mirror.co.uk/showbiz/tv/todaystv/2007/10/26/rebus-89520-20012661/ Rebus], ''[[Daily Mirror]]'', 26 October 2007</ref> but [[Detective sergeant#Police Usage|DS]] [[Siobhan Clarke]], his colleague in the later books, is a [[season ticket]] holder at [[Easter Road]]. In the 2006 [[Rebus (TV)|television adaptation]] of the series, Rebus is a Hibs fan and proposes on the pitch at Easter Road.<ref>[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aIkGQkkiM8A rebus the hibee], [[YouTube]]</ref> [[Ken Stott]], who is a [[Heart of Midlothian F.C.|Hearts]] fan, played the part of Rebus in the 2006 adaptation.<ref>[http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/tm_objectid=16458882&method=full&siteid=66633&headline=born-to-be-rebus--name_page.html BORN TO BE REBUS], ''[[Daily Record (Scotland)|Daily Record]]'', 8 December 2005.</ref>

{{main article|List of Hibernian F.C. managers}}
Hibs did not officially appoint a [[head coach|manager]] until 1903 because they did not [[Incorporation (business)#Incorporation in the United Kingdom|incorporate]] until then. From 1875 until 1903, the club were run by a [[committee]],<ref>Mackay (1986), pp98.</ref> although [[Dan McMichael]] was effectively the manager when the club won the [[Scottish Cup 1901<U+2013>02|1902 Scottish Cup]] and the [[1902-03 in Scottish football|1903 league championship]].
