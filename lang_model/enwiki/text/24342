He eventually had her visit the White House where she became an informal, back door, messenger with Gorbachev and his administration.

In 1975, Suzanne Massie and her then-husband [[Robert K. Massie]] chronicled their experiences as the parents of a hemophiliac child and the significant differences between the American and French health-care systems in their jointly-written book, Journey.
