{{tropical cyclone}}{{Redirect4|Hurricane|Typhoon}}

A '''tropical cyclone''' is a [[storm|storm system]] characterized by a [[low pressure system|low pressure]] center and numerous [[thunderstorms]] that produce strong winds and flooding rain.  A tropical cyclone feeds on the heat released when moist air rises  and the water vapor it contains [[condensation|condenses]]. They are fueled by a different heat mechanism than other cyclonic windstorms such as [[nor'easter]]s, [[European windstorm]]s, and [[polar low]]s, leading to their classification as "warm core" storm systems.

The term "tropical" refers to both the geographic origin of these systems, which form almost exclusively in [[tropics|tropical]] regions of the globe, and their formation in [[Air mass#Classification|Maritime Tropical air masses]]. The term "cyclone" refers to such storms' [[cyclone|cyclonic]] nature, with [[Clockwise and counterclockwise|counterclockwise]] rotation in the [[Northern Hemisphere]] and clockwise rotation in the [[Southern Hemisphere]]. Depending on their location and strength, tropical cyclones are referred to by other names, such as '''hurricane''', '''typhoon''', '''tropical storm''', '''cyclonic storm''', and '''tropical depression'''.

While tropical cyclones can produce extremely powerful winds and torrential [[rain]], they are also able to produce high waves and damaging [[storm surge]]. They develop over large bodies of warm water, and lose their strength if they move over land. This is the reason coastal regions can receive significant damage from a tropical cyclone, while inland regions are relatively safe from receiving strong winds. Heavy rains, however, can produce significant flooding inland, and storm surges can produce extensive coastal [[flood]]ing up to {{convert|40|km|mi}} from the coastline. Although their effects on human populations can be devastating, tropical cyclones can also relieve [[drought]] conditions. They also carry heat and energy away from the tropics and transport it towards [[temperate]] [[latitudes]], which makes them an important part of the global [[atmospheric circulation]] mechanism. As a result, tropical cyclones help to maintain equilibrium in the Earth's [[troposphere]], and to maintain a relatively stable and warm temperature worldwide.  

Many tropical cyclones [[tropical cyclogenesis|develop]] when the atmospheric conditions around a weak disturbance in the atmosphere are favorable. Others form when [[#Related cyclone types|other types of cyclones]] acquire tropical characteristics. Tropical systems are then moved by [[#Steering winds|steering winds]] in the [[troposphere]]; if the conditions remain favorable, the tropical disturbance intensifies, and can even develop an [[eye (cyclone)|eye]]. On the other end of the spectrum, if the conditions around the system deteriorate or the tropical cyclone makes landfall, the system weakens and eventually dissipates.

{{Seealso|Eye (cyclone)}}
[[Image:Hurricane structure graphic.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Structure of a tropical cyclone]]
All tropical cyclones are areas of [[low pressure area|low]] [[atmospheric pressure]] near the Earth's surface. The pressures recorded at the centers of tropical cyclones are among the lowest that occur on Earth's surface at [[sea level]].<ref name="ABC pressures">{{cite news | author = Symonds, Steve |title = Highs and Lows | work = Wild Weather | publisher = [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]] | date = [[November 17]], [[2003]] | accessdate = 2007-03-23 | url = http://www.abc.net.au/northcoast/stories/s989385.htm}}</ref> Tropical cyclones are characterized and driven by the release of large amounts of latent [[heat of condensation]], which occurs when moist air is carried upwards and its water vapor condenses. This heat is distributed vertically around the center of the storm. Thus, at any given altitude (except close to the surface, where water temperature dictates air temperature) the environment inside the cyclone is warmer than its outer surroundings.<ref name = "AOML FAQ A7">{{cite web | author = [[Atlantic Oceanographic and Meteorological Laboratory]], Hurricane Research Division | title = Frequently Asked Questions: What is an extra-tropical cyclone? | publisher = [[NOAA]] | accessdate = 2007-03-23 | url = http://www.aoml.noaa.gov/hrd/tcfaq/A7.html}}</ref> 

===Banding===
[[Rainbands]] are bands of showers and thunderstorms that spiral cyclonically toward the storm center. High wind gusts and heavy downpours often occur in individual rainbands, with relatively calm weather between bands. Tornadoes often form in the rainbands of landfalling tropical cyclones.<ref name="JetStream structure">{{cite web | url = http://www.srh.noaa.gov/jetstream/tropics/tc_structure.htm | author = [[National Weather Service]] | publisher = [[National Oceanic & Atmospheric Administration]] | title = Tropical Cyclone Structure | accessdate = 2006-12-14 | work = JetStream - An Online School for Weather | date = [[October 19]], [[2005]]}}</ref> [[Annular hurricane|Intense annular tropical cyclones]] are distinctive for their lack of rainbands; instead, they possess a thick circular area of disturbed weather around their low pressure center.<ref name="KnaffJournal">{{cite journal | url = http://www.ssec.wisc.edu/~kossin/articles/annularhurr.pdf | title = Annular Hurricanes | accessdate = 2006-07-23 | last = Knaff | first = John A. | coauthors = James P.

The upper levels of a tropical cyclone feature winds directed away from the center of the storm with an [[anticyclonic]] rotation, due to the [[Coriolis effect]]. [[Wind]]s at the surface are strongly cyclonic, weaken with height, and eventually reverse themselves. Tropical cyclones owe this unique characteristic to requiring a relative lack of vertical [[wind shear]] to maintain the warm core at the center of the storm.<ref>{{citeweb|publisher=[[University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign|University of Illinois]]|url=http://ww2010.atmos.uiuc.edu/(Gh)/guides/mtr/hurr/grow/home.rxml |title=Hurricanes|accessdate= 2006-10-21}}</ref><ref>{{citebook|title=Flood Geomorphology |author= R.

===Eye and inner core ===
A strong tropical cyclone will harbor an area of sinking air at the center of circulation. If this area is strong enough, it can develop into an [[eye (cyclone)|eye]]. Weather in the eye is normally calm and free of clouds, although the sea may be extremely violent.<ref name="JetStream structure"/> The eye is normally circular in shape, and may range in size from {{convert|3|km|mi}} to {{convert|370|km|mi}} in diameter.<ref name="WilmaTCR">{{cite web|last=Pasch|first=Richard J.|coauthors=Eric S.

There are other features that either surround the eye, or cover it.

The heaviest wind damage occurs where a tropical cyclone's eyewall passes over land.<ref name="JetStream structure"/>  [[Eye (cyclone)#Eyewall replacement cycles|eyewall replacement cycles]] occur naturally in intense tropical cyclones.  When cyclones reach peak intensity they usually have an eyewall and [[radius of maximum wind]]s that contract to a very small size, around {{convert|10|km|mi}} to {{convert|25|km|mi}}.  Outer rainbands can organize into an outer ring of thunderstorms that slowly moves inward and robs the inner eyewall of its needed moisture and [[angular momentum]].    When the inner eyewall weakens, the tropical cyclone weakens (in other words, the maximum sustained winds weaken and the central pressure rises.)  The outer eyewall replaces the inner one completely at the end of the cycle.  The storm can be of the same intensity as it was previously or even stronger after the eyewall replacement cycle finishes.  The storm may strengthen again as it builds a new outer ring for the next eyewall replacement.<ref name = "AOML FAQ D8">{{cite web | author = Atlantic Oceanographic and Hurricane Research Division | title = Frequently Asked Questions: What are "concentric eyewall cycles" (or "eyewall replacement cycles") and why do they cause a hurricane's maximum winds to weaken? | publisher = [[NOAA]] | accessdate = 2006-12-14 | url = http://www.aoml.noaa.gov/hrd/tcfaq/D8.html}}</ref>

[http://wind.mit.edu/~emanuel/anthro2.htm Anthropogenic Effects on Tropical Cyclone Activity.] Retrieved on [[2008-02-25]].</ref>]]

A tropical cyclone's primary energy source is the release of the [[heat of condensation]] from water vapor [[condensation|condensing]] at high altitudes, with [[solar heating]] being the initial source for evaporation. Therefore, a tropical cyclone can be visualized as a giant vertical [[heat engine]] supported by mechanics driven by physical forces such as the [[rotation]] and [[gravity]] of the Earth.<ref name = "NOAA preparedness">{{cite web | author = [[National Weather Service]] | date = September 2006 | title = Hurricanes...

Factors such as a continued lack of equilibrium in air mass distribution would also give supporting energy to the cyclone.

What primarily distinguishes tropical cyclones from other meteorological phenomena is deep [[convection#Atmospheric heat-driven convection|convection]] as a driving force.<ref name="BOM Question 6">{{cite web | author = [[Bureau of Meteorology]] | work = Frequently Asked Questions | title = How are tropical cyclones different to mid-latitude cyclones? | url = http://www.bom.gov.au/weather/wa/cyclone/about/faq/faq_def_6.shtml | accessdate = 2006-03-31}}</ref> Because convection is strongest in a [[tropical climate]], it defines the initial domain of the tropical cyclone.

The passage of a tropical cyclone over the ocean can cause the upper layers of the ocean to cool substantially, which can influence subsequent cyclone development. Cooling is primarily caused by upwelling of cold water from deeper in the ocean due to the wind stresses the storm itself induces upon the sea surface. Additional cooling may come in the form of cold water from falling raindrops. Cloud cover may also play a role in cooling the ocean, by shielding the ocean surface from direct sunlight before and slightly after the storm passage. All these effects can combine to produce a dramatic drop in sea surface temperature over a large area in just a few days.<ref name="NASA Cooling">{{cite web | author = Eric A. D'Asaro and Peter G.

Scientists at the US [[National Center for Atmospheric Research]] estimate that a tropical cyclone releases heat energy at the rate of 50 to 200&nbsp;[[exajoule]]s (10<sup>18</sup>&nbsp;J) per day,<ref name="NOAA Question of the Month"/> equivalent to about 1&nbsp;PW (10<sup>15</sup>&nbsp;watt).

While the most obvious motion of clouds is toward the center, tropical cyclones also develop an upper-level (high-altitude) outward flow of clouds. These originate from air that has released its moisture and is expelled at high altitude through the "chimney" of the storm engine.<ref name = "NOAA preparedness"/> This outflow produces high, thin [[cirrus cloud]]s that spiral away from the center.

==Movement and track==
===Steering winds===
Although tropical cyclones are large systems generating enormous energy, their movements over the Earth's surface are controlled by large-scale winds&mdash;the streams in the Earth's atmosphere. The path of motion is referred to as a tropical cyclone's ''track'' and has been analogized by Dr. Neil Frank, former director of the [[National Hurricane Center]], to "leaves carried along by a stream".<ref name = "AOML FAQ G6">{{cite web | author = [[Atlantic Oceanographic and Meteorological Laboratory]], Hurricane Research Division | title = Frequently Asked Questions: What determines the movement of tropical cyclones?|publisher = [[NOAA]] | accessdate = 2006-07-25 | url = http://www.aoml.noaa.gov/hrd/tcfaq/G6.html}}</ref>

Tropical systems, while generally located [[equator]]ward of the 20th parallel, are steered primarily westward by the east-to-west winds on the equatorward side of the [[subtropical ridge]]<U+2014>a persistent high pressure area over the world's oceans.<ref name = "AOML FAQ G6"/> In the tropical North Atlantic and Northeast Pacific oceans, [[trade winds]]<U+2014>another name for the westward-moving wind currents<U+2014>steer [[tropical waves]] westward from the [[Africa]]n coast and towards the Caribbean Sea, North America, and ultimately into the central Pacific ocean before the waves dampen out.<ref name = "AOML FAQ A4">{{ cite web | author = [[Atlantic Oceanographic and Meteorological Laboratory]], Hurricane Research Division | title = Frequently Asked Questions: What is an easterly wave? | publisher = [[NOAA]] | accessdate = [[2006-07-25]] | url = http://www.aoml.noaa.gov/hrd/tcfaq/A4.html}}</ref> These waves are the precursors to many tropical cyclones within this region.<ref name="MWR Avila 1995"/> In the Indian Ocean and Western Pacific (both north and south of the equator), tropical cyclogenesis is strongly influenced by the seasonal movement of the [[Intertropical Convergence Zone]] and the [[monsoon trough]], rather than by easterly waves.<ref name="MILLER7">{{cite web | author = DeCaria, Alex | publisher = [[Millersville University of Pennsylvania|Millersville University]] | url = http://snowball.millersville.edu/~adecaria/ESCI344/esci344_lesson05_TC_climatology.html | title = Lesson 5 <U+2013> Tropical Cyclones: Climatology. | work = ESCI 344 <U+2013> Tropical Meteorology | year = 2005 | accessdate = [[2008-02-22]]}}</ref>

===Coriolis effect===
[[Image:Cyclone Monica.gif|thumb|180px|right|Infrared image of [[Cyclone Monica]] near peak intensity, showing [[clockwise]] rotation due to the [[Coriolis effect]]]]
The Earth's rotation imparts an acceleration known as the ''[[Coriolis effect]]'', ''Coriolis acceleration'', or colloquially, ''Coriolis force''.  This acceleration causes cyclonic systems to turn towards the poles in the absence of strong steering currents.<ref name="Paleoglossary Cn-Cz">{{cite web | author = Baum, Steven K. | url = http://stommel.tamu.edu/~baum/paleo/paleogloss/node10.html | title = The Glossary: Cn-Cz. | work = Glossary of Oceanography and the Related Geosciences with References | publisher = [[Texas A&M University]] | date = [[January 20]], [[1997]] | accessdate = 2006-11-29}}</ref> The poleward portion of a tropical cyclone contains easterly winds, and the Coriolis effect pulls them slightly more poleward. The westerly winds on the equatorward portion of the cyclone pull slightly towards the equator, but, because the Coriolis effect weakens toward the equator, the net drag on the cyclone is poleward. Thus, tropical cyclones in the [[Northern Hemisphere]] usually turn north (before being blown east), and tropical cyclones in the [[Southern Hemisphere]] usually turn south (before being blown east) when no other effects counteract the Coriolis effect.<ref name="BritTCtrackcoriolis">[[Encyclop<U+00E6>dia Britannica]]. [http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-247936/tropical-cyclone#849004.hook Tropical cyclone:  Tropical cyclone tracks.] Retrieved on [[2008-02-25]].</ref>

The Coriolis effect also initiates cyclonic rotation, but it is not the driving force that brings this rotation to high speeds <U+2013> that force is the [[heat of condensation]].<ref name="NOAA Question of the Month"/>

===Interaction with the mid-latitude westerlies===
[[Image:Ioke 2006 track.png|thumb|right|Storm track of [[Hurricane Ioke|Typhoon Ioke]], showing recurvature off the [[Japan]]ese coast in [[2006 Pacific hurricane season|2006]]]]
When a tropical cyclone crosses the [[subtropical ridge]] axis, its general track around the high-pressure area is deflected significantly by winds moving towards the general low-pressure area to its north. When the cyclone track becomes strongly poleward with an easterly component, the cyclone has begun ''recurvature.''<ref>U. S. Navy. [http://www.nrlmry.navy.mil/~chu/chap4/se200.htm Section 2: Tropical Cyclone Motion Terminology.] Retrieved on [[2007-04-10]].</ref> A typhoon moving through the Pacific Ocean towards Asia, for example, will recurve offshore of [[Japan]] to the north, and then to the northeast, if the typhoon encounters southwesterly winds (blowing northeastward) around a low-pressure system passing over [[China]] or [[Siberia]]. Many tropical cyclones are eventually forced toward the northeast by [[extratropical cyclone]]s in this manner, which move from west to east to the north of the subtropical ridge. An example of a tropical cyclone in recurvature was [[Hurricane Ioke|Typhoon Ioke]] in 2006, which took a similar trajectory.<ref name="CPHC Ioke">{{cite web | url = http://www.prh.noaa.gov/cphc/summaries/2006.php#ioke | title = Hurricane Ioke: 20-27 August 2006 | date = May 2007 | accessdate = 2007-06-09 | author = Powell, Jeff, et al. | work = 2006 Tropical Cyclones Central North Pacific | publisher = [[Central Pacific Hurricane Center]]}}</ref>

===Landfall===
{{see also|List of notable tropical cyclones|Tropical cyclogenesis#Unusual areas of formation|l2=Unusual areas of tropical cyclone formation}}
Officially, ''[[landfall (meteorology)|landfall]]'' is when a storm's center (the center of its circulation, not its edge) crosses the coastline.<ref name="NHC glossary"/> Storm conditions may be experienced on the coast and inland hours before landfall; in fact, a tropical cyclone can launch its weakest winds over land, yet not make landfall; if this occurs, then it is said that the storm made a ''direct hit'' on the coast.<ref name="NHC glossary"/> Due to this definition, the landfall area experiences half of a land-bound storm by the time the actual landfall occurs. For emergency preparedness, actions should be timed from when a certain wind speed or intensity of rainfall will reach land, not from when landfall will occur.<ref name="NHC glossary">{{cite web | author = [[National Hurricane Center]] | url = http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/aboutgloss.shtml | year = 2005 | title = Glossary of NHC/TPC Terms | accessdate= 2006-11-29 | publisher = [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]]}}</ref>

===Multiple storm interaction===
{{Main article|Fujiwhara effect}}
When two cyclones approach one another, their centers will begin orbiting cyclonically about a point between the two systems.  The two vortices will be attracted to each other, and eventually spiral into the center point and merge.  When the two vortices are of unequal size, the larger vortex will tend to dominate the interaction, and the smaller vortex will orbit around it. This phenomenon is called the Fujiwhara effect, after Dr. Sakuhei Fujiwhara.<ref>[[USA Today]].

==Dissipation==

A tropical cyclone can cease to have tropical characteristics through several different ways. One such way is if it moves over land, thus depriving it of the warm water it needs to power itself, quickly losing strength.<ref>[[National Hurricane Center]].

A tropical cyclone can dissipate when it moves over waters significantly below {{convert|26.5|C|F}}.

===Artificial dissipation===
In the 1960s and 1970s, the [[United States government]] attempted to weaken hurricanes through [[Project Stormfury]] by [[cloud seeding|seeding]] selected storms with [[silver iodide]].  It was thought that the seeding would cause [[supercooled water]] in the outer rainbands to freeze, causing the inner eyewall to collapse and thus reducing the winds.<ref>Hurricane Research Division.

==Observation and forecasting==
===Observation===

Intense tropical cyclones pose a particular observation challenge, as they are a dangerous oceanic phenomenon, and [[weather station]]s, being relatively sparse, are rarely available on the site of the storm itself. Surface observations are generally available only if the storm is passing over an island or a coastal area, or if there is a nearby ship. Usually, real-time measurements are taken in the periphery of the cyclone, where conditions are less catastrophic and its true strength cannot be evaluated. For this reason, there are teams of meteorologists that move into the path of tropical cyclones to help evaluate their strength at the point of landfall.<ref name="FCMP">{{cite web | url = http://users.ce.ufl.edu/~fcmp/overview/overview.htm | author = Florida Coastal Monitoring Program | title = Project Overview | accessdate = 2006-03-30 | publisher = [[University of Florida]]}}</ref>

Tropical cyclones far from land are tracked by [[weather satellite]]s capturing [[visible light|visible]] and [[infrared]] images from space, usually at half-hour to quarter-hour intervals. As a storm approaches land, it can be observed by land-based [[Pulse-Doppler radar|Doppler]] [[weather radar|radar]].  Radar plays a crucial role around landfall by showing a storm's location and intensity every several minutes.<ref name="CPHC">Central Pacific Hurricane Center. [http://www.prh.noaa.gov/cphc/HAW/observations.php Observations.] Retrieved on [[2006-12-09]].</ref>

[[In-situ]] measurements, in real-time, can be taken by sending specially equipped reconnaissance flights into the cyclone. In the Atlantic basin, these flights are regularly flown by United States government [[hurricane hunters]].<ref name="Hurricane Hunters">{{cite web | author = 403rd Wing | url = http://www.hurricanehunters.com | title = The Hurricane Hunters | publisher = [[Hurricane Hunters|53rd Weather Reconnaissance Squadron]] | accessdate = 2006-03-30}}</ref> The aircraft used are [[WC-130]] Hercules and [[WP-3D]] Orions, both four-engine [[turboprop]] cargo aircraft. These aircraft fly directly into the cyclone and take direct and remote-sensing measurements. The aircraft also launch [[GPS dropsonde]]s inside the cyclone. These sondes measure temperature, humidity, pressure, and especially winds between flight level and the ocean's surface. A new era in hurricane observation began when a remotely piloted [[Aerosonde]], a small drone aircraft, was flown through Tropical Storm Ophelia as it passed Virginia's Eastern Shore during the 2005 hurricane season. A similar mission was also completed successfully in the western Pacific ocean. This demonstrated a new way to probe the storms at low altitudes that human pilots seldom dare.<ref name="SunHerald">{{cite news | author = Lee, Christopher | title = Drone, Sensors May Open Path Into Eye of Storm | url = http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/10/07/AR2007100700971_pf.html | publisher = [[The Washington Post]] | accessdate = 2008-02-22}}</ref>

===Forecasting===
{{seealso|Tropical cyclone forecasting|Tropical cyclone prediction model|Tropical cyclone rainfall forecasting}}
Because of the forces that affect tropical cyclone tracks, accurate track predictions depend on determining the position and strength of high- and low-pressure areas, and predicting how those areas will change during the life of a tropical system. The deep layer mean flow, or average wind through the depth of the [[troposphere]], is considered the best tool in determining track direction and speed. If storms are significantly sheared, use of wind speed measurements at a lower altitude, such as at the 700&nbsp;[[mbar|hPa]] pressure surface ({{convert|3000|m|ft}} above sea level) will produce better predictions. Tropical forecasters also consider smoothing out short-term wobbles of the storm as it allows them to determine a more accurate long-term trajectory.<ref>{{cite web | author = [[United States Navy]] | url = http://www.nrlmry.navy.mil/~chu/chap4/se100.htm | title = Influences on Tropical Cyclone Motion | accessdate = 2007-04-10}}</ref> High-speed computers and sophisticated simulation software allow forecasters to produce [[tropical cyclone prediction model|computer models]] that predict tropical cyclone tracks based on the future position and strength of high- and low-pressure systems. Combining forecast models with increased understanding of the forces that act on tropical cyclones, as well as with a wealth of data from Earth-orbiting satellites and other sensors, scientists have increased the accuracy of track forecasts over recent decades.<ref name="NHC forecast verifications models">{{cite web | author = [[National Hurricane Center]] | url = http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/verification/verify6.shtml?#FIG1 | work = National Hurricane Center Forecast Verification | title = Annual average model track errors for Atlantic basin tropical cyclones for the period 1994-2005, for a homogeneous selection of "early" models | accessdate = 2006-11-30 | publisher = [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]] | date = [[May 22]], [[2006]]}}</ref> However, scientists are less skillful at predicting the intensity of tropical cyclones.<ref name="NHC forecast verifications Atlantic">{{cite web | author = [[National Hurricane Center]] | work = National Hurricane Center Forecast Verification | url = http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/verification/verify5.shtml? | title = Annual average official track errors for Atlantic basin tropical cyclones for the period 1989-2005, with least-squares trend lines superimposed | accessdate = 2006-11-30 | publisher = [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]] | date = [[May 22]], [[2006]]}}</ref> The lack of improvement in intensity forecasting is attributed to the complexity of tropical systems and an incomplete understanding of factors that affect their development.

==Classifications, terminology, and naming==
===Intensity classifications===
{{main|Tropical cyclone scales}}
[[Image:Typhoon saomai 060807.jpg|thumb|right|180px|Three tropical cyclones at different stages of development. The weakest (left), demonstrates only the most basic circular shape. A stronger storm (top right) demonstrates [[rainbands|spiral banding]] and increased centralization, while the strongest (lower right) has developed an [[eye (cyclone)|eye]].]]
Tropical cyclones are classified into three main groups, based on intensity: tropical depressions, tropical storms, and a third group of more intense storms, whose name depends on the region. For example, if a [[#Tropical Storm|tropical storm]] in the Northwestern Pacific reaches hurricane-strength winds on the [[Beaufort scale]], it is referred to as a ''typhoon''; if a tropical storm passes the same benchmark in the [[Pacific hurricane|Northeast Pacific Basin]], or in [[Atlantic hurricane|the Atlantic]], it is called a ''hurricane''.<ref name="NHC glossary"/> Neither "hurricane" nor "typhoon" is used in the South Pacific.

Additionally, as indicated in the table below, each basin uses a separate [[Tropical cyclone scales|system of terminology]], making comparisons between different basins difficult. In the Pacific Ocean, hurricanes from the Central North Pacific sometimes cross the [[International Date Line]] into the Northwest Pacific, becoming typhoons (such as [[Hurricane Ioke|Hurricane/Typhoon Ioke]] in 2006); on rare occasions, the reverse will occur.<ref name="CPHC John TCR">{{cite web | author=[[Central Pacific Hurricane Center]] | title=Hurricane John Preliminary Report | publisher=[[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]] | url=http://www.prh.noaa.gov/cphc/summaries/1994.php#John | year= 2004 | accessdate=2007-03-23}}</ref> It should also be noted that typhoons with sustained winds greater than {{convert|67|m/s|kn}} or {{convert|150|mph|km/h}} are called ''Super Typhoons'' by the Joint Typhoon Warning Center.<ref name="SUPERDUPER">{{cite web | author = Bouchard, R. H. | url = http://metocph.nmci.navy.mil/jtwc/pubref/References/where_have_all_the_super_typhoons_gone.ppt | title = A Climatology of Very Intense Typhoons: Or Where Have All the Super Typhoons Gone? | format = [[Microsoft PowerPoint|PPT]] | accessdate = 2006-12-05 | date = April 1990}}</ref>

<span id="Tropical depression" /> A '''tropical depression''' is an organized system of clouds and thunderstorms with a defined, closed surface circulation and [[maximum sustained wind]]s of less than {{convert|17|m/s|kn}} or {{convert|39|mph|km/h}}. It has no [[eye (cyclone)|eye]] and does not typically have the organization or the spiral shape of more powerful storms. However, it is already a low-pressure system, hence the name "depression".<ref name = "NOAA preparedness"/> The practice of the [[Philippines]] is to name tropical depressions from their own naming convention when the depressions are within the Philippines' area of responsibility.<ref name="AOML FAQ B2">{{cite web | author = [[Atlantic Oceanographic and Meteorological Laboratory]], Hurricane Research Division | title = Frequently Asked Questions: What are the upcoming tropical cyclone names? | publisher = [[NOAA]] | accessdate = 2006-12-11 | url = http://www.aoml.noaa.gov/hrd/tcfaq/B2.html}}</ref>

<span id="Tropical storm" /> A '''tropical storm''' is an organized system of strong thunderstorms with a defined surface circulation and maximum sustained winds between {{convert|17|m/s|kn}} ({{convert|39|mph|km/h}}) and {{convert|32|m/s|kn}} ({{convert|73|mph|km/h}}). At this point, the distinctive cyclonic shape starts to develop, although an eye is not usually present. Government weather services, other than the Philippines, first assign names to systems that reach this intensity (thus the term ''named storm'').<ref name = "NOAA preparedness"/>

<span id="Hurricane" /><span id="Typhoon" /> A '''hurricane''' or '''typhoon''' (sometimes simply referred to as a tropical cyclone, as opposed to a depression or storm) is a system with sustained winds of at least {{convert|33|m/s|kn}} or {{convert|74|mph|km/h}}.<ref name = "NOAA preparedness"/> A cyclone of this intensity tends to develop an eye, an area of relative calm (and lowest atmospheric pressure) at the center of circulation. The eye is often visible in satellite images as a small, circular, cloud-free spot. Surrounding the eye is the [[eyewall]], an area about {{convert|16|km|mi}} to {{convert|80|km|mi}} wide in which the strongest [[thunderstorm]]s and winds circulate around the storm's center. Maximum sustained winds in the strongest tropical cyclones have been estimated at about {{convert|85|m/s|kn}} or {{convert|195|mph|km/h}}.<ref name = "AOML FAQ E1"/>

===Origin of storm terms===
[[Image:101.typhoon.altonthompson.jpg|thumb|230px| [[Taipei 101]] endures a typhoon in 2005]]The word ''typhoon'', used today in the Northwest Pacific, may be derived from [[Urdu language|Urdu]], [[Persian language|Persian]] and [[Arabic language|Arabic]] ''<U+0163><U+016B>f<U+0101>n'' (<U+0637><U+0648><U+0641><U+0627><U+0646>), which in turn originates from [[Greek language|Greek]] ''[[Typhon|tuph<U+014D>n]]'' (<U+03A4><U+03C5><U+03C6><U+03CE><U+03BD>), a monster in [[Greek mythology]] responsible for hot winds.<ref name="Greek typhoon">{{cite encyclopedia | encyclopedia = [[The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language]] | year = 2004 | publisher = [[Dictionary.com]] | url = http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/typhoon | accessdate = 2006-12-14 | title = Typhoon | edition = 4th ed.}}</ref> The related [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] word ''tuf<U+00E3>o'', used in Portuguese for typhoons, is also derived from Greek ''tuph<U+014D>n''.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.crid.or.cr/crid/ESP/sistregio/vocabulario/Listado%20Alfab%E9tico%20de%20T%E9rminos%20Eng..pdf

The word ''hurricane'', used in the North Atlantic and Northeast Pacific, is derived from the name of a native [[Caribbean]] [[Amerindian]] storm [[god]], [[Huracan]], via [[Spanish language|Spanish]] ''hurac<U+00E1>n''.<ref name = "AOML FAQ B4">{{cite web | author = [[Atlantic Oceanographic and Meteorological Laboratory]], Hurricane Research Division | title = Frequently Asked Questions: What is the origin of the word "hurricane"?|publisher = [[NOAA]] | accessdate = 2006-07-25 | url = http://www.aoml.noaa.gov/hrd/tcfaq/B4.html}}</ref> (Huracan is also the source of the word ''Orcan'', another word for the [[European windstorm]]. These events should not be confused.) Huracan became the Spanish term for hurricanes.

===Naming===
{{main|Tropical cyclone naming|Lists of tropical cyclone names}}
Storms reaching tropical storm strength were initially given names to eliminate confusion when there are multiple systems in any individual basin at the same time, which assists in warning people of the coming storm.<ref>National Hurricane Center. [http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/aboutnames.shtml Worldwide Tropical Cyclone Names.] Retrieved on [[2006-12-28]].</ref> In most cases, a tropical cyclone retains its name throughout its life; however, under [[Tropical cyclone naming#Renaming of tropical cyclones|special circumstances]], tropical cyclones may be renamed while active. These names are taken from lists that vary from region to region and are drafted a few years ahead of time. The lists are decided on, depending on the regions, either by committees of the [[World Meteorological Organization]] (called primarily to discuss many other issues), or by national weather offices involved in the forecasting of the storms. Each year, the names of particularly destructive storms (if there are any) are "retired" and new names are chosen to take their place.

== Long-term activity trends ==
[[Image:NOAA ACE index 1950-2004 RGB.svg|thumb|right|250px|Atlantic Multidecadal Cycle since 1950, using accumulated cyclone energy (ACE)]]
:{{seealso|Atlantic hurricane reanalysis}}
While the number of storms in the Atlantic has increased since 1995, there is no obvious global trend; the annual number of tropical cyclones worldwide remains about 87&nbsp;<U+00B1>&nbsp;10. However, the ability of climatologists to make long-term data analysis in certain basins is limited by the lack of reliable historical data in some basins, primarily in the Southern Hemisphere.<ref name="Landsea Trends">{{cite journal | author = [[Chris Landsea|Landsea, Chris]], et al. | title = Can We Detect Trends in Extreme Tropical Cyclones? | url = http://www.aoml.noaa.gov/hrd/Landsea/landseaetal-science06.pdf | journal = [[Science (journal)|Science]] | format = PDF| volume = 313 | pages = 452&ndash;454 | date = [[July 28]], [[2006]] | accessdate = 2007-06-09}}</ref> In spite of that, there is some evidence that the intensity of hurricanes is increasing. [[Kerry Emanuel]] stated, "Records of hurricane activity worldwide show an upswing of both the maximum wind speed in and the duration of hurricanes. The energy released by the average hurricane (again considering all hurricanes worldwide) seems to have increased by around 70% in the past 30&nbsp;years or so, corresponding to about a 15% increase in the maximum wind speed and a 60% increase in storm lifetime."<ref name="EmanuelHomepage">{{cite web | url = http://wind.mit.edu/~emanuel/anthro2.htm | author = [[Kerry Emanuel|Emanuel, Kerry]] | title = Anthropogenic Effects on Tropical Cyclone Activity | accessdate = 2006-03-30 | date = January 2006}}</ref>

Atlantic storms are becoming more destructive financially, since five of the ten most expensive storms in United States history have occurred since 1990. This can be attributed to the increased intensity and duration of hurricanes striking North America,<ref name="EmanuelHomepage"/> and to a greater degree, the number of people living in susceptible coastal areas, following increased development in the region since the last surge in Atlantic hurricane activity in the 1960s.

Often in part because of the threat of hurricanes, many coastal regions had sparse population between major ports until the advent of automobile tourism; therefore, the most severe portions of hurricanes striking the coast may have gone unmeasured in some instances. The combined effects of ship destruction and remote landfall severely limit the number of intense hurricanes in the official record before the era of hurricane reconnaissance aircraft and satellite meteorology. Although the record shows a distinct increase in the number and strength of intense hurricanes, therefore, experts regard the early data as suspect.<ref name="BOM TC Guide 1.3">{{cite web | publisher = [[Bureau of Meteorology]] | url = http://www.bom.gov.au/bmrc/pubs/tcguide/ch1/ch1_3.htm | title = 1.3: A Global Climatology | author = Neumann, Charles J. | work = Global Guide to Tropical Cyclone Forecasting | accessdate = 2006-11-30}}</ref>

The number and strength of Atlantic hurricanes may undergo a 50&ndash;70 year cycle, also known as the [[Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation]]. Although more common since 1995, few above-normal hurricane seasons occurred during 1970&ndash;94.<ref name="RMS activity">{{cite web | author = [[Risk Management Solutions]] | url = http://www.rms.com/Publications/60HUActivityRates_whitepaper.pdf | format = PDF | title = U.S. and Caribbean Hurricane Activity Rates. | date = March 2006 | accessdate = 2006-11-30}}</ref> Destructive hurricanes struck frequently from 1926&ndash;60, including many major New England hurricanes. Twenty-one Atlantic tropical storms formed in [[1933 Atlantic hurricane season|1933]], a record only recently exceeded in [[2005 Atlantic hurricane season|2005]], which saw 28 storms. Tropical hurricanes occurred infrequently during the seasons of 1900&ndash;25; however, many intense storms formed during 1870&ndash;99. During the 1887 season, 19 tropical storms formed, of which a record 4 occurred after [[1 November]] and 11 strengthened into hurricanes. Few hurricanes occurred in the 1840s to 1860s; however, many struck in the early 19th century, including an 1821 storm that made a direct hit on [[New York City]]. Some historical weather experts say these storms may have been as high as [[Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale|Category 4]] in strength.<ref name="Columbia CCSR">{{cite web | author = Center for Climate Systems Research | title = Hurricanes, Sea Level Rise, and New York City | url = http://www.ccsr.columbia.edu/information/hurricanes/ | publisher = [[Columbia University]] | accessdate = 2006-11-29}}</ref>

These active hurricane seasons predated satellite coverage of the Atlantic basin. Before the satellite era began in 1960, tropical storms or hurricanes went undetected unless a reconnaissance aircraft encountered one, a ship reported a voyage through the storm, or a storm hit land in a populated area.<ref name="BOM TC Guide 1.3"/> The official record, therefore, could miss storms in which no ship experienced gale-force winds, recognized it as a tropical storm (as opposed to a high-latitude extra-tropical cyclone, a tropical wave, or a brief squall), returned to port, and reported the experience.

==Global warming==
:{{seealso|Global warming}}
The U.S. [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]] [[Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory]] performed a simulation to determine if there is a [[statistics|statistical]] [[Periodic trends|trend]] in the frequency or strength of cyclones over time. The simulation concluded "the strongest hurricanes in the present climate may be upstaged by even more intense hurricanes over the next century as the earth's climate is warmed by increasing levels of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere".<ref name="GFDL warming">{{cite web | author = [[Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory]] | url = http://www.oar.noaa.gov/spotlite/archive/spot_gfdl.html | title = Global Warming and Hurricanes | accessdate = 2006-11-29 | publisher = [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]]}}</ref> 

In an article in ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'', [[Kerry Emanuel]] stated that potential hurricane destructiveness, a measure combining hurricane strength, duration, and frequency, "is highly correlated with tropical sea surface temperature, reflecting well-documented climate signals, including multidecadal oscillations in the North Atlantic and North Pacific, and global warming". Emanuel predicted "a substantial increase in hurricane-related losses in the twenty-first century".<ref name="Nature Emanuel 2005">{{cite journal | url = ftp://texmex.mit.edu/pub/emanuel/PAPERS/NATURE03906.pdf | format = PDF | author = [[Kerry Emanuel|Emanuel, Kerry]] | journal =[[Nature (journal)|Nature]] | volume = 436 | issue = 7051 | pages = 686<U+2013>688 | accessdate = 2006-03-20 | title = Increasing destructiveness of tropical cyclones over the past 30 years}}</ref>  Similarly, P.J. Webster and others published an article in ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'' examining the "changes in tropical cyclone number, duration, and intensity" over the past 35&nbsp;years, the period when satellite data has been available. Their main finding was although the number of cyclones decreased throughout the planet excluding the north [[Atlantic Ocean]], there was a great increase in the number and proportion of very strong cyclones.<ref name="Webster et al. 2005">{{cite journal | author = Webster, P. J., G. J. Holland, J. A. Curry and H.-R. Chang | url = http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/reprint/309/5742/1844.pdf | title = Changes in Tropical Cyclone Number, Duration, and Intensity in a Warming Environment | format = PDF | journal = [[Science (journal)|Science]] | date = [[September 16]], [[2005]] | volume = 309 | issue = 5742 | pages = 1844&ndash;1846 | accessdate = 2006-03-20}}</ref>

The strength of the reported effect is surprising in light of modeling studies<ref>{{cite journal|author = Knutson, Thomas R. and Robert E. Tuleya|title= Impact of CO2-Induced Warming on Simulated Hurricane Intensity and Precipitation:Sensitivity to the Choice of Climate Model and Convective Parameterization|journal=Journal of Climate|volume=17|issue=18|year=2004|pages=3477&ndash;3494}}</ref> that predict only a one half category increase in storm intensity as a result of a ~2&nbsp;<U+00B0>C (3.6&nbsp;<U+00B0>F) global warming.  Such a response would have predicted only a ~10% increase in Emanuel's potential destructiveness index during the 20th century rather than the ~75&ndash;120% increase he reported.<ref name="Nature Emanuel 2005"/>  Secondly, after adjusting for changes in population and inflation, and despite a more than 100% increase in Emanuel's potential destructiveness index, no statistically significant increase in the monetary damages resulting from Atlantic hurricanes has been found.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Pielke, R. A. Jr|journal=Nature|doi=10.1038/nature04426|year=2005|title=Meteorology: Are there trends in hurricane destruction?|pages=E11}}</ref>

In February 2007, the [[United Nations]] [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]] released its [[IPCC Fourth Assessment Report|fourth assessment report]] on [[climate change]]. The report noted many observed changes in the climate, including atmospheric composition, global average temperatures, ocean conditions, among others. The report concluded the observed increase in tropical cyclone intensity is larger than climate models predict. Additionally, the report considered that it is likely that storm intensity will continue to increase through the 21st century, and declared it more likely than not that there has been some human contribution to the increases in tropical cyclone intensity.<ref name="ipcc">{{cite web|author=Richard Alley, et. al|year=2007|title=Contribution of Working Group I to the Fourth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change|publisher=United Nations|accessdate=2007-02-23|url=http://www.ipcc.ch/ipccreports/ar4-syr.htm|format=HTML}}</ref> However, there is no universal agreement about the magnitude of the effects anthropogenic global warming has on tropical cyclone formation, track, and intensity.

In addition to tropical cyclones, there are two other classes of cyclones within the spectrum of cyclone types. These kinds of cyclones, known as [[extratropical cyclone]]s and [[subtropical cyclone]]s, can be stages a tropical cyclone passes through during its [[tropical cyclogenesis|formation]] or dissipation.<ref>Mark A.

An ''extratropical cyclone'' is a storm that derives energy from horizontal temperature differences, which are typical in higher latitudes. A tropical cyclone can become extratropical as it moves toward higher latitudes if its energy source changes from heat released by condensation to differences in temperature between air masses;<ref name = "AOML FAQ A7">{{cite web | author = [[Atlantic Oceanographic and Meteorological Laboratory]], Hurricane Research Division | title = Frequently Asked Questions: What is an extra-tropical cyclone?|publisher = [[NOAA]] | accessdate = 2006-07-25 | url = http://www.aoml.noaa.gov/hrd/tcfaq/A7.html}}</ref> additionally, although not as frequently, an extratropical cyclone can transform into a subtropical storm, and from there into a tropical cyclone.
