'''''Love It to Death''''' is the third album by the [[Alice Cooper (band)|Alice Cooper band]], released in 1971.  It was the band's first commercially successful album, and is considered where the band first consolidated its aggressive hard-rocking sound.  The album's best-known track, "[[I'm Eighteen]]", was released as a single to test the band's commercial viability before the album was recorded.

Formed in the mid-1960s, the band took the name Alice Cooper in 1968 and became known for its outrageous theatrical live shows.  The loose, psychedelic [[Freak scene|freak rock]] of its first two albums failed to find an audience.  The band moved to Detroit in 1970 and was influenced by the aggressive hard rock scene there.  The group enlisted a young [[Bob Ezrin]] as producer and spent two months rehearsing ten to twelve hours a day as Ezrin encouraged the band to tighten its songwriting.  Soon after, the single "I'm Eighteen" achieved top-forty success, peaking at number 21.  This convinced [[Warner Bros. Records|Warner Bros.]] that Alice Cooper had the commercial potential to release an album.  After its release in March 1971 ''Love It to Death'' reached number 35 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] albums chart and has since been [[RIAA certification|certified platinum]].  The album's second single, "[[Caught in a Dream]]", charted at number 94.

The original album cover featured Cooper posed with his thumb protruding so it appeared to be his penis; Warner Bros. soon replaced it with a censored version.  The Love It to Death tour featured an elaborate [[shock rock]] live show: during "Ballad of Dwight Fry"<U+2014>about an inmate in an insane asylum<U+2014>Cooper would be dragged offstage and return in a straitjacket, and the show climaxed with Cooper's mock execution in a prop electric chair during "Black Juju".  Ezrin and the Coopers continued to work together for a string of hit albums until the band's breakup in 1974.  The album has come to be seen as a foundational influence on [[hard rock]], [[Punk rock|punk]], and [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]]; several tracks have become live Alice Cooper standards and are frequently covered by other bands.

==Background==

Detroit-born vocalist [[Alice Cooper|Vincent Furnier]] co-formed the Earwigs in the mid-1960s in Phoenix, Arizona, with guitarist [[Glen Buxton]], guitarist and keyboardist [[Michael Owen Bruce|Michael Bruce]], bassist [[Dennis Dunaway]], and drummer [[Neal Smith (drummer)|Neal Smith]]. The band released a few singles in 1967 after changing names to the Spiders.{{sfn|Hoffmann|2004|p=478}} In 1968 the band changed names again to Alice Cooper<U+2014>a name Furnier later adopted for his own<U+2014>and perpetuated the story that it came from a 17th-century witch whose name they learned from a session with a [[ouija]] board.{{sfn|Konow|2009|p=31}}

At some point Buxton painted circles under his eyes with cigarette ashes, and soon the rest followed with ghoulish black makeup and outlandish clothes.{{sfn|Konow|2009|p=31}} The band moved to Los Angeles{{sfn|Konow|2009|p=31}} and became known for its provocative, theatrical [[shock rock]] stage show.{{sfn|Lenig|2010|p=117}} In a headline-grabbing incident during a performance at the [[Toronto Rock and Roll Revival]] in 1969, Cooper threw a live chicken into the audience, and it was torn to shreds.{{sfn|Konow|2009|p=33}}

[[File:The Mothers of Invention (1968).jpg|thumb|left|alt=Black-and-white photo of five long-haired men|[[Frank Zappa]] ''(in back)'' signed [[Alice Cooper (band)|Alice Cooper]] and released the band's first two albums.]]

The group's first two albums, ''[[Pretties for You]]'' (1969) and ''[[Easy Action]]'' (1970) appeared on [[Frank Zappa]]'s [[Straight Records]] label, and failed to find an audience. The band relocated to Detroit and found itself in the midst of a rock scene populated with the hard driving rock of the [[MC5]], the stage-diving [[Iggy Pop]] with [[the Stooges]], and the theatricality of [[George Clinton (musician)|George Clinton]]'s [[Parliament-Funkadelic|Parliament and Funkadelic]]. The Alice Cooper band went on to incorporate these influences, resulting in a tight, hard-rock driven sound with an outrageous theatrical live show beginning.{{sfn|Brackett|Hoard|2004|p=12}}

While at the [[Strawberry Fields (Canadian festival)|Strawberry Fields Festival]] in Canada in April 1970 the band's manager [[Shep Gordon]] contacted producer [[Jack Richardson (record producer)|Jack Richardson]], who had produced hit singles for [[the Guess Who]].  Richardson was uninterested himself in producing the Alice Cooper band, and sent nineteen-year-old [[Bob Ezrin]] in his place.  Cooper recalled the young junior producer as "a nineteen-year-old Jewish hippie" who reacted to meeting the outlandish band "as if he had just opened a surprise package and found a box full of maggots".{{sfn|Crouse|2012|p=104}}

Ezrin initially turned down working with the band, but had a change of heart when he saw them live at [[Max's Kansas City]] in New York City the following October.  Ezrin was impressed with the band's audience-participation rock-theater performance and the cult-like devotion of the band's fans who dressed up and knew the lyrics and actions to the music, which Ezrin compared to the later [[The Rocky Horror Picture Show cult following|cult following of the ''The Rocky Horror Picture Show'']].{{sfn|Crouse|2012|p=104}}  Ezrin returned to Toronto to convince Richardson to take on the band; Richardson did not want to work directly with such a group but agreed on condition that Ezrin took the lead.{{sfn|Crouse|2012|pp=104<U+2013>105}}

==Recording and production==

The band and Ezrin did pre-production for the album in [[Pontiac, Michigan]] in November and December 1970, and recording was done at the RCA Mid-American Recording Center in Chicago in December.  Richardson was executive producer, and Richardson and Ezrin produced the album for Richardson's Nimbus 9 Productions.{{sfn|Sherman|2009|p=25}}

Ezrin, with his classical and folk background, attempted to have the band tighten the loosely-structured songs.  The band resisted at first, but came to see things Ezrin's way, and ten to twelve hours a day of rehearsal resulted in a tight set of hard rock songs with little of the psychedelic freak-rock aesthetic of the first two albums.  According to Cooper, Ezrin "ironed the songs out note by note, giving them coloring, personality".{{sfn|Crouse|2012|p=105}}  Ezrin rearranged "I'm Eighteen" from an eight-minute jam piece called "I Wish I Was 18 Again" to a tight three-minute rocker.{{sfn|Sherman|2009|p=26}}

Buxton and Bruce both used [[Gibson SG]] guitars{{sfnm|1a1=Interactive Guitar staff|1y=2012|2a1=Prown|2a2=Newquist|2y=1997|2p=99}} and tended to double up, playing similar parts with subtle differences in phrasing and tone.{{sfn|Interactive Guitar staff|2012}}  Dunaway's bass part is often a moving [[counter-melody]] rather than following the typical rock strategy of holding to the [[root (chord)|root]].{{sfn|Baseford|2010}}

Zappa had sold Straight Records to [[Warner Bros. Records|Warner Bros.]] in 1970 for $50,000.{{sfn|Konow|2009|p=34}}  That November{{sfn|Faulk|2013|p=126}}{{efn|October, according to some sources.{{sfn|Sherman|2009|p=29}} }} the group released a single of "I'm Eighteen" backed with "Is It My Body",{{efn|"Is It My Body" was incorrectly listed as "Body" and then "(Is It My) Body" on early pressings of the single.{{sfn|Sherman|2009|p=29}} }} and Warner Bros. agreed that if it sold well the group could go forward with an album.  The band posed as fans and made hundreds of calls to radio stations to request the song, and Gordon is said to have paid others a dollar per radio request.  Soon the song was on the airwaves across the country<U+2014>even on mainstream AM radio<U+2014>and peaked at number 21 on the charts.{{sfn|Konow|2009|p=37}}  The success of the single convinced Warner to contract Richardson to produce ''Love It to Death''<U+2014>one of the first times an American producer assigned a Canadian to produce an album.{{sfn|Billboard staff|1971a|p=68}}  "I'm Eighteen" was a sixteen-track recording at 15 [[Inch per second|IPS]]; other tracks were recorded at 30 IPS.{{sfn|Baseford|2010}}

[[File:Dwight_Frye.png|thumb|alt=Black-and-white photograph of a seated man in a suit and tie|[[Dwight Frye]] was a real-life horror movie actor, dubbed "the man with the thousand-watt stare".]]

The classically-trained Ezrin was intent on developing a cohesive sound for the band, and his earnestness was a source of humor for the band.{{sfn|Thompson|2012|p=135}}  At a time when the reputation of [[the Beatles]] made them seem beyond criticism, the band meant "Second Coming" was intended at as a jab at the recently released track "[[The Long and Winding Road]]" and the elaborate production [[Phil Spector]] had given it.  The hyperbolic acclaim it received struck the band as if it were the [[Second Coming]] of a master composer on the order of [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]]<U+2014>and at Ezrin's attempts to bring such production values to Alice Cooper's music.  Ezrin did not realize the joke was largely at his expense.{{sfn|Thompson|2012|pp=135<U+2013>136}}  When recording the "I wanna get out of here" sequence of "Ballad of Dwight Fry," Ezrin had Cooper lie on the floor surrounded by a cage of metal chairs.{{sfn|Thompson|2012|p=136}}  "Black Juju" was the only track recorded live in the studio.{{sfn|Sherman|2009|p=26}}

"[[Caught in a Dream]]" was released as a single backed with "Hallowed Be My Name"{{sfnm|1a1=Billboard staff|1y=1971c|1p=66|2a1=Sherman|2y=2009|2p=29}} on April&nbsp;27, 1971; it peaked in the US at number&nbsp;94.{{sfn|Sherman|2009|p=29}}  The group supported the album with extensive touring.  "Ballad of Dwight Frye" was a dramatized set piece in the live show, featuring an actress dressed as a nurse{{efn|The nurse was place by drummer Neal Smith's sister Cindy, who later married bassist Dennis Dunaway.{{sfn|Sherman|2009|p=27}} }} who dragged Cooper offstage and brought him back on [[straitjacket]]ed in time for the second verse's "Sleepin' don't come very easy&nbsp;/ In a strait white vest".  At the song's climax, Cooper would break free of the straitjacket and hurl it into the audience.{{sfn|Waksman|2009|p=78}}  The Love It to Death tour of 1971 featured an [[electric chair]] in the earliest staged executions of the singer.  These executions were to become an attraction of the band's shows, which became progressively more flamboyant; the shows in the [[Billion Dollar Babies]] tour of 1973 concluded with Cooper's execution by prop [[guillotine]].{{sfn|Waksman|2009|p=86}}  The Love It to Death tour grossed so much the band bought a forty-two room mansion from [[Ann-Margret]] in [[Greenwich, Connecticut]], which was to be its home base for the next few years.{{sfn|Konow|2009|p=37}}

The album garnered mixed reviews.  ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' called the album "artfully absurd third-generation rock" and the group "the first stars of future rock".{{sfn|Billboard staff|1971b}}  [[John Mendelsohn (musician)|John Mendelsohn]] gave the album a favorable review in ''Rolling Stone'', writing it "represents at least a modest oasis in the desert of dreary blue-jeaned aloofness served up in concert by most American rock-and-rollers." However, referring to "Black Juju" he also stated that "the one bummer on this album is so loud a bummer that it may threaten to neutralize the ingratiating effect" of the other tracks.{{sfn|Mendelsohn|1971}}  [[Robert Christgau]] rated it B<U+2212>, stating that he "never would have figured this theatre type to come up with it" and calling "I'm Eighteen" "as archetypal a hard rock single as you're liable to hear in this flaccid year, or maybe ever".{{sfn|Christgau}}

The band and saw its popularity rise over the next several albums.  ''[[Killer (Alice Cooper album)|Killer]]'' followed in November 1971 and reached number 21 on the US charts,{{sfn|Konow|2009|p=40}} and the band finally topped those charts in 1973 with its sixth album, ''Billion Dollar Babies''.{{sfn|Konow|2009|p=41}}  Unreleased [[Demo (music)|demos]] of ''Love It to Death'' have circulated among fans; highlights include outtakes of "Ballad of Dwight Fry" with alternate lyrics and early versions of "You Drive Me Nervous", which did not have an official release until it appeared on ''Killer''.{{sfn|Sherman|2009|p=27}}

==Content==

A dark, aggressive song whose lumbering, [[Distortion (music)|distorted]] main guitar riff is in E minor, "I'm Eighteen" was the band's first hit.  In raspy vocals against [[Arpeggio|arpeggiated]] guitar backing, the lyrics speak of the existential anguish of being at the cusp of adulthood, decrying in each verse being "in the middle"<U+2014>"of life" or "of doubt".  The chorus switches to a series of crashing [[power chord]]s building from A, the vocals proclaiming: "I'm eighteen&nbsp;/ And I don't know what I want&nbsp;... I gotta get out of this place&nbsp;/ I'll go runnin' in outer space".  The song turns around at the conclusion with an embrace of those things that had been such anguish: "I'm eighteen and I like it!"{{sfn|Waksman|2009|pp=84<U+2013>85}}

"I'm Eighteen" is sandwiched between two straight-ahead rockers: "Long Way to Go" and album opener "Caught in a Dream".  Both follow simple hard-rock formulas, trading heavy riffing with guitar fills and solos.{{sfn|Prown|Newquist|1997|p=99}}  The album title derives from lyrics found in "Long Way to Go",{{sfn|Sherman|2009|p=26}} and "Caught in a Dream" was the album's second single and features irreverent, tongue-in-cheek lyrics such as "I need everything the world owes me&nbsp;/ I tell that to myself and I agree".{{sfn|Swanson}}  The first side closes with "Black Juju" by bassist Dunaway, an lengthy track in the eerie vein of [[The Doors]] and the [[Pink Floyd]]'s "[[Interstellar Overdrive]]"<U+2014>both bands Alice Cooper had earlier opened for.{{sfn|Swanson}}  The song was named after a stray dog the band knew in Pontiac, and the organ part derives from Pink Floyd's "[[Set the Controls for the Heart of the Sun]]".{{sfn|Sherman|2009|p=26}}

"Is It My Body", the B-side to the "I'm Eighteen" single,{{sfn|Konow|2009|p=37}} opens the second side of the album.  The verses to the sleazy boogie pose the questions: "What have I got?&nbsp;/ That makes you want to love me?&nbsp;/ Is it my body?"<U+2014>and declare in the chorus: "Have you got the time to find out&nbsp;/ Who I really am?"{{sfn|Kofman|2014}}  "Hallowed Be My Name" follows with lyrics such as "Screaming at mothers&nbsp;/ Cursing the Bible".  "Second Coming" continues with religious-themed lyrics: "...&nbsp;have no other gods before me&nbsp;/ I'm the light&nbsp;/ The devil's getting smarter all the time"{{sfn|Maloney|2011|p=182}}  The track developed from a lyrical fragment Cooper had come up with<U+2014>"Time is getting closer&nbsp;/ I read it on a poster"<U+2014>and is set to a delicate piano by Ezrin.{{sfn|Thompson|2012|pp=135<U+2013>136}}

"The Ballad of Dwight Fry" is a dramatic piece about an insane man in a mental asylum.  It opens with a young girl's voice asking if her "Daddy" will "ever come home",{{efn|The voice of the little girl was performed by a friend of the band,{{sfn|Thompson|2012|p=136}} Monica Lauer.{{sfn|Sherman|2009|p=25}}  Michael Bruce did the voice for the band's live shows.{{sfn|Sherman|2009|p=27}} }} against a childlike piano backdrop.  The song shifts to [[acoustic guitar]] and Cooper singing presumably in the persona of the girl's father,{{sfn|Waksman|2009|p=77}} singing at first in a wavering almost-whisper.  His voice builds with his persona's increasing instability, breaking out in shouting in the heavy, electric guitar-backed chorus: "See my only mind explode&nbsp;/ Since I've gone away".  After the second chorus there is a softer, creepy keyboard break{{sfn|Waksman|2009|p=78}} by Buxton,{{sfn|Thompson|2012|p=136}} and when the vocals reappear they repeat "I wanna get out of here", at first tentative and imploring, eventually climaxing in the character's total mental breakdown and a return to the chorus.{{sfn|Waksman|2009|p=78}}  The name of the song's main character is drawn from [[Dwight Frye]],{{sfn|Waksman|2009|p=77}} an actor Hollywood media dubbed "the man with the thousand-watt stare"{{sfn|Thompson|2012|pp=136<U+2013>137}} and who portrayed [[Renfield]], the lunatic slave of the titular vampire in the 1931 film ''[[Dracula (1931 English-language film)|Dracula]]'' starring [[Bela Lugosi]].{{sfn|Waksman|2009|p=77}}

The album closes with a cover of "[[Sun Arise]]" by Australian entertainer [[Rolf Harris]].  The upbeat pop song song had been a show-opener for the band throughout 1970, and is a dramatic contrast to the darkness of the rest of the album.{{sfn|Thompson|2012|p=135}}

[[Thrash metal]] band [[Anthrax (American band)|Anthrax]] included a cover of "I'm Eighteen" on its debut album ''[[Fistful of Metal]]'' in 1984.{{sfn|Wall|2010|p=146}}  [[Alternative metal]] band the [[Melvins]] covered "second Coming" and "Ballad of Dwight Fry" on their album ''[[Lysol (album)|Lysol]]'' in 1992.{{sfn|Earles|2014|p=192}}  The song "Dreamin'" on the 1998 Kiss album ''[[Psycho Circus]]'' bears such a resemblance to "I'm Eighteen" that a month after the album's release Cooper's publisher filed a plagiarism suit, settled out of court in Cooper's favor.{{sfn|English|2007|pp=46<U+2013>47}}  Swedish [[death metal]] band [[Entombed (band)|Entombed]] released an EP in 1999 entitled ''Black Juju'' that includes a cover of "Black Juju".{{sfn|Botchick|1999|p=28}}<!--  "Is It My Body" was covered by [[Emilie Autumn]].{{cn|date=November 2014}}-->
