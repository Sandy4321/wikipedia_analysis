'''Vivien Leigh''' ([[November 5]], [[1913]] &ndash; [[July 8]], [[1967]]) was an [[English people|English]] [[Actor|actress]] who achieved outstanding success in [[theatre]] and [[Film|cinema]]. Although her film appearances were relatively few, she won two [[Academy Awards]] playing "[[Southern belle]]s", [[Scarlett O'Hara]] in ''[[Gone With the Wind (film)|Gone With the Wind]]'' (1939) and [[Blanche DuBois]] in ''[[A Streetcar Named Desire (film)|A Streetcar Named Desire]]'' (1951), a role she had also played in [[London]]'s [[West End of London|West End]]. She was a prolific stage performer, frequently in collaboration with her husband, [[Laurence Olivier]], who directed her in several of her roles. During her thirty-year stage career, she aimed to demonstrate her versatility as an actress, playing parts that ranged from the heroines of [[Noel Coward|No<U+00EB>l Coward]] and [[George Bernard Shaw]] comedies to classic [[William Shakespeare|Shakespearean]] characters such as [[Ophelia (character)|Ophelia]], [[Cleopatra]], [[Juliet]] and [[Lady Macbeth (Shakespeare)|Lady Macbeth]].

Lauded for her beauty, Leigh felt that it sometimes prevented her from being taken seriously as an actress, a viewpoint shared by some of her contemporaries, but ill health proved to be her greatest obstacle. Affected by [[bipolar disorder]] for most of her adult life, Leigh's extreme moods were often misunderstood, and as she gained a reputation for being difficult, her career went through periods of decline. She was further weakened by recurrent bouts of [[tuberculosis]], which was first diagnosed in the mid-1940s. She and Olivier divorced in 1960, and Leigh worked sporadically in film and theatre until her sudden death from tuberculosis.

==Early life and acting career==
Leigh was born '''Vivian Mary Hartley''', in [[Darjeeling]] in [[India]], to Ernest Hartley, an officer in the Indian Cavalry who was of [[English people|English]] parentage, and Gertrude Robinson Yackje, who was of [[French people|French]]-[[Irish people|Irish]] descent. The family relocated to [[Bangalore]], where Vivian Hartley made her first stage appearance at the age of three, reciting "Little Bo Peep" for her mother's amateur theatre group. Gertrude Hartley tried to instill in her daughter an appreciation of literature, and introduced her to the works of [[Hans Christian Andersen]], [[Lewis Carroll]] and [[Rudyard Kipling]], as well as stories of [[Greek mythology]]. An only child, Vivian Hartley was sent to the "Convent of the Sacred Heart" in [[Roehampton]] in England, in 1920. Her closest friend at the convent was the future actress [[Maureen O'Sullivan]], to whom she expressed her ambitions to become "a great actress".<ref>Edwards, Anne. ''Vivien Leigh, A Biography'', Coronet Books, 1978 edition. ISBN 034023024x pp 12-19 </ref>

Vivian Hartley completed her later education in [[Europe]], returning to her parents in England in 1931. She discovered that one of Maureen O'Sullivan's films was playing in London's [[West End of London|West End]] and told her parents of her ambitions to become an actress. Both were highly supportive, and her father helped her enroll at the [[Royal Academy of Dramatic Art]] (RADA) in London.<ref>Edwards, Anne. ''Vivien Leigh, A Biography'', Coronet Books, 1978 edition. ISBN 034023024x pp 25-30</ref>

In late 1931 she met Herbert Leigh Holman, known as Leigh, a barrister thirteen years her senior. Despite his disapproval of "theatrical people", they were married on [[December 20]], [[1932]], and upon their marriage she terminated her studies at RADA. On [[October 12]], [[1933]], she gave birth to a daughter, Suzanne, but felt stifled by her domestic life. Her friends suggested her for a small part in the film ''Things Are Looking Up'', which marked her film debut. She engaged an agent, John Gliddon, who felt that the name "Vivian Holman" was not suitable for an actress, and after rejecting his suggestion, "April Morn", she took "Vivian Leigh" as her professional name. Gliddon recommended her to [[Alexander Korda]] as a possible film actress, but Korda rejected her as lacking potential.<ref>Edwards, Anne. ''Vivien Leigh, A Biography'', Coronet Books, 1978 edition. ISBN 034023024x pp 30-43 </ref>

Cast in the play ''The Mask of Virtue'' in 1935, Leigh received excellent reviews followed by interviews and newspaper articles, among them one from the ''[[Daily Express]]'' in which the interviewer noted "a lightning change came over her face", which was the first public mention of the rapid changes in mood that became characteristic of her.<ref>Coleman, Terry, ''Olivier, The Authorised Biography'', Bloomsbury Publishing, 2005, ISBN 0747583064 p 74</ref> [[John Betjeman]], the future [[Poet Laureate]], also wrote about her, describing her as "the essence of English girlhood".<ref>Coleman, Terry, ''Olivier, The Authorised Biography'', Bloomsbury Publishing, 2005, ISBN 0747583064 p 75</ref> Korda, who attended her opening-night performance, admitted his error and signed her to a film contract, with the spelling of her name revised to "Vivien Leigh". She continued with the play, but when Korda moved it to a larger theatre, Leigh was found to be unable to project her voice adequately, or to hold the attention of so large an audience, and the play folded soon after.<ref>Edwards, Anne. ''Vivien Leigh, A Biography'', Coronet Books, 1978 edition. ISBN 034023024x pp 50-55 </ref> In 1960 Leigh recalled her ambivalence towards her first experience of critical acclaim and sudden fame, commenting, "some critics saw fit to be as foolish as to say that I was a great actress. And I thought, that was a foolish, wicked thing to say, because it put such an onus and such a responsibility onto me, which I simply wasn't able to carry. And it took me years to learn enough to live up to what they said for those first notices. I find it so stupid. I remember the critic very well, and have never forgiven him."<ref>[http://www.vivien-leigh.com/interview.html ''Actors Talk About Acting'' - Vivien Leigh interview (1961)] Edited by John E.

==Meeting Laurence Olivier==
[[Image:FireOverEnglandVivienLeighLaurenceOlivier.jpg|left|thumb|250px|Leigh with [[Laurence Olivier]] in ''[[Fire Over England]]'' (1937), their first collaboration.]]
[[Laurence Olivier]] saw Leigh in ''The Mask of Virtue'', and a friendship developed after he congratulated her on her performance. While playing lovers in the film ''[[Fire Over England]]'' (1937), Olivier and Leigh developed a strong attraction, and after filming was completed, they began an affair. During this time Leigh read the [[Margaret Mitchell]] novel ''[[Gone with the Wind]]'' and instructed her agent to suggest her to [[David O. Selznick]], who was planning a film version. Selznick replied that he was not interested, having never so much as seen a photograph of her before, but Leigh continued to hope to play the part. She remarked to a journalist, "I've cast myself as [[Scarlett O'Hara]]", and the film critic C. A. Lejeune recalled a conversation of the same period in which Leigh "stunned us all" with the assertion that Olivier "won't play [[Rhett Butler]], but I shall play Scarlett O'Hara. Wait and see."<ref>Coleman, Terry, ''Olivier, The Authorised Biography'', Bloomsbury Publishing, 2005, ISBN 0747583064 pp 76-77, 90, 94-95 </ref>

Leigh played [[Ophelia]] to Olivier's [[Hamlet]] in an [[Old Vic Theatre]] production, and Olivier later recalled an incident during which her mood rapidly changed as she was quietly preparing to go onstage. Without apparent provocation, she began screaming at him, before suddenly becoming silent and staring into space. She was able to perform without mishap, and by the following day, she had returned to normal with no recollection of the event. It was the first time Olivier witnessed such behaviour from her.<ref>Coleman, Terry, ''Olivier, The Authorised Biography'', Bloomsbury Publishing, 2005. ISBN 0747583501; p 97-98 </ref> They began living together; Holman and Olivier's wife, the actress [[Jill Esmond]], each having refused to grant either a divorce.

Leigh appeared with [[Robert Taylor (actor)|Robert Taylor]], [[Lionel Barrymore]] and Maureen O'Sullivan in ''[[A Yank at Oxford]]'' (1938), the first of her films to receive attention in the United States. During production she developed a reputation for being difficult and unreasonable, and Korda instructed her agent to warn her that her option would not be renewed if her behaviour did not improve.<ref> Coleman, Terry, ''Olivier, The Authorised Biography'', Bloomsbury Publishing, 2005. ISBN 0747583501; p 97 </ref> Her next role was in ''[[St. Martin's Lane]]'' (1938) with [[Charles Laughton]].

==Achieving international success==
Olivier had been attempting to broaden his film career; despite his success in Britain, he was not well-known in the United States and earlier attempts to introduce him to the American market had failed. Offered the role of [[Heathcliff]] in [[Samuel Goldwyn]]'s production of ''[[Wuthering Heights (1939 film)|Wuthering Heights]]'' (1939), he travelled to Hollywood, leaving Leigh in London. Goldwyn and the film's director, [[William Wyler]], offered Leigh the secondary role of Isabella, but she refused it, saying she would only play Cathy, a role already assigned to [[Merle Oberon]]. Leigh travelled to Los Angeles, ostensibly to be with Olivier; however, she arranged meetings with prospective employers soon after her arrival.<ref> Berg, A. Scott. ''Goldwyn'', Sphere Books, 1989. ISBN 074740593x, p 323</ref>
[[Image:Vivien-Leigh publicity still Gone-with-the-Wind.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Leigh in a 1939 publicity photograph for ''Gone with the Wind''.]]
Hollywood was in the midst of a widely publicised search to find an actress to portray [[Scarlett O'Hara]] in [[Gone with the Wind (film)|''Gone with the Wind'']] ([[1939 in film|1939]]), and when Leigh met Olivier's American [[agent (law)|agent]] [[Myron Selznick]], he felt that she possessed the qualities his brother [[David O. Selznick]] was searching for. Myron Selznick took Leigh and Olivier to the set where the "burning of Atlanta" scene was being filmed and introduced Leigh. The following day, Leigh read a scene for Selznick, who organised a [[screen test]] and wrote to his wife, "She's the Scarlett dark horse and looks damn good. Not for anyone's ear but your own: it's narrowed down to [[Paulette Goddard]], [[Jean Arthur]], [[Joan Bennett]] and Vivien Leigh". The director [[George Cukor]] concurred and praised the "incredible wildness" of Leigh, who was given the part soon after.<ref>Haver, Ronald. ''David O. Selznick's Hollywood'', Bonanza Books, New York, 1980. [ISBN 0517476657]; p 259</ref>

Filming proved difficult for Leigh; Cukor was dismissed and replaced by [[Victor Fleming]], with whom Leigh frequently quarrelled. She and [[Olivia de Havilland]] secretly met with Cukor at night and on weekends for his advice about how they should play their parts. She befriended [[Clark Gable]], his wife [[Carole Lombard]] and de Havilland, but she clashed with [[Leslie Howard (actor)|Leslie Howard]], with whom she was required to play several emotional scenes. Adding to her distress, she was sometimes required to work seven days a week, often late into the night, and she missed Olivier who was working in New York. She wrote to Leigh Holman, "I loathe Hollywood.... I will never get used to this &ndash; how I ''hate'' film acting."<ref> Taylor, John Russell. ''Vivien Leigh'', Elm Tree Books, 1984. [ISBN 0241113334] pp 22-23</ref>

In 2006 Olivia de Havilland responded to claims of Leigh's manic behaviour during filming ''Gone with the Wind'', published in a biography of Laurence Olivier. She defended Leigh, saying, "Vivien was impeccably professional, impeccably disciplined on ''Gone with the Wind''. She had two great concerns: doing her best work in an extremely difficult role and being separated from Larry [Olivier], who was in New York."<ref> [http://www.dcexaminer.com/articles/2006/01/04/features/books/62bbooks04olivier.txt The Washington Examiner] Bob Thomas, ''The Associated Press'', published January 3, 2006. Retrieved January 7, 2006, quoting [[Olivia de Havilland]]</ref>

''Gone with the Wind'' brought Leigh immediate attention and fame, but she was quoted as saying, "I'm not a film star &ndash; I'm an actress. Being a film star &ndash; just a film star &ndash; is such a false life, lived for fake values and for publicity. Actresses go on for a long time and there are always marvellous parts to play."<ref> Taylor, John Russell. ''Vivien Leigh'', Elm Tree Books, 1984. [ISBN 0241113334] pp 22-23</ref>
Among the ten [[Academy Awards]] won by ''Gone with the Wind'' was a [[Academy Award for Best Actress|Best Actress]] award for Leigh, who also won a [[New York Film Critics Circle Award for Best Actress]].

==Marriage and joint projects==
In February 1940 Jill Esmond agreed to divorce Olivier, and Holman also agreed to divorce Leigh, although they maintained a strong friendship for the rest of Leigh's life. Esmond was granted custody of Tarquin, her son with Olivier, and Holman was granted custody of Suzanne, his daughter with Leigh. On [[August 30]] Olivier and Leigh were married in [[Santa Barbara, California]], in a ceremony attended only by their witnesses, [[Katharine Hepburn]] and [[Garson Kanin]].

Leigh hoped to star with Olivier and made a screentest for ''[[Rebecca (film)|Rebecca]]'', which was to be directed by [[Alfred Hitchcock]] with Olivier in the leading role, but after viewing her screentest Selznick noted that "she doesn't seem right as to sincerity or age or innocence", a view shared by Hitchcock, and Leigh's mentor, George Cukor. <ref>McGilligan, Patrick. ''Alfred Hitchcock, A Life in Darkness and Light'', ''Wiley Press'', 2003. ISBN 0470869739, p 238. </ref> Selznick also observed that she had shown no enthusiam for the part until Olivier had been confirmed as the lead actor, and subsequently cast [[Joan Fontaine]]. He also refused to allow her to join Olivier in ''[[Pride and Prejudice (1940 film)|Pride and Prejudice]]'' (1940), and [[Greer Garson]] took the part Leigh had envisioned for herself. ''[[Waterloo Bridge (movie)|Waterloo Bridge]]'' (1940) was to have starred Olivier and Leigh, however Selznick replaced Olivier with [[Robert Taylor (actor)|Robert Taylor]], then at the peak of his success as one of [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]]'s most popular male stars. Leigh's top-billing reflected her status in Hollywood, and despite her reluctance to participate without Olivier, the film proved to be popular with audiences and critics.

She and Olivier mounted a stage production of ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]'' for [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]]. The New York press discussed the adulterous nature that had marked the beginning of Olivier and Leigh's relationship, and questioned their ethics in not returning to England to help with the [[World War II|war]] effort, and the critics were hostile in their assessment of the production. [[Brooks Atkinson]] for the ''[[New York Times]]'' wrote, "Although Miss Leigh and Mr Olivier are handsome young people they hardly act their parts at all."<ref>Edwards, Anne. ''Vivien Leigh, A Biography'', Coronet Books, 1978 edition. ISBN 034023024x p 127 </ref> While most of the blame was attributed to Olivier's acting and direction, Leigh was also criticised, with [[Bernard Grebanier]] commenting on the "thin, shopgirl quality of Miss Leigh's voice." The couple had invested almost their entire savings into the project, and its failure was a financial disaster for them.<ref> Holden, Anthony, ''Olivier'', Sphere Books Limited, 1989, ISBN 13579108642; pp 189-190 </ref>

They filmed ''[[That Hamilton Woman]]'' (1941) with Olivier as [[Horatio Nelson]] and Leigh as [[Emma Hamilton]]. With Britain engaged in World War II, it was one of several Hollywood films made with the aim of arousing a pro-British sentiment among American audiences. The film was popular in the United States, but was an outstanding success in the [[Soviet Union]]. [[Winston Churchill]] arranged a screening for a party which included [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] and, on its conclusion, addressed the group, saying, "Gentlemen, I thought this film would interest you, showing great events similar to those in which you have just been taking part." The Oliviers remained favourites of Churchill, attending dinners and occasions at his request for the rest of his life, and of Leigh he was quoted as saying, "By Jove, she's a clinker."<ref> Holden, Anthony, ''Olivier'', Sphere Books Limited, 1989, ISBN 13579108642; pp 202, 205 and 325 </ref>

The Oliviers returned to England, and Leigh toured through [[North Africa]] in 1943, performing for troops before falling ill with a persistent cough and fevers. In 1944 she was diagnosed as having [[tuberculosis]] in her left [[lung]], but after spending several weeks in hospital, she appeared to be cured. In spring she was filming ''[[Caesar and Cleopatra]]'' (1945) when she discovered she was pregnant, but suffered a miscarriage. She fell into a deep depression which reached its nadir when she turned on Olivier, verbally and physically attacking him until she fell to the floor sobbing. This was the first of many major breakdowns; Olivier came to recognise the symptoms of an impending episode &ndash; several days of hyperactivity followed by a period of [[depression]] and an explosive breakdown, after which Leigh would have no memory of the event, but would be acutely embarrassed and remorseful.<ref>Holden, Anthony, ''Olivier'', Sphere Books Limited, 1989, ISBN 13579108642; pp 221-222 </ref>

She was well enough to resume acting in 1946 in a successful London production of [[Thornton Wilder]]'s ''[[The Skin of Our Teeth]]'', but her films of this period, ''[[Caesar and Cleopatra]]'' (1945) and ''[[Anna Karenina]]'' (1948), were not great successes.

In 1947 Olivier was knighted, and Leigh accompanied him to [[Buckingham Palace]] for the investiture. She became Lady Olivier, a title she continued to use after their divorce, until she died.

By 1948 Olivier was on the Board of Directors for the [[Old Vic Theatre]], and he and Leigh embarked on a tour of [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]] to raise funds for the theatre. During their six-month tour, Olivier performed ''[[Richard III]]'' and also performed with Leigh in ''[[The School for Scandal]]'' and ''The Skin of Our Teeth''. The tour was an outstanding success, and although Leigh was plagued with [[insomnia]] and allowed her understudy to replace her for a week while she was ill, she generally withstood the demands placed upon her, with Olivier noting her ability to "charm the press". Members of the company later recalled several quarrels between the couple, with the most dramatic of these occurring in [[Christchurch]] when Leigh refused to go on stage. Olivier slapped her face, and Leigh slapped him in return and swore at him before she made her way to the stage. By the end of the tour, both were exhausted and ill, and Olivier told a journalist, "You may not know it, but you are talking to a couple of walking corpses." Later he would comment that he "lost Vivien" in Australia.<ref>Holden, Anthony, ''Olivier'', Sphere Books Limited, 1989, ISBN 13579108642; pp 295 </ref>

The success of the tour encouraged the Oliviers to make their first [[West End of London|West End]] appearance together, performing the same works with one addition, ''[[Antigone]]'', included at Leigh's insistence because she wished to play a role in a tragedy.
[[Image:VivienLeighMarlonBrandoAStreetcarNamedDesire.jpg|thumb|left|300px|As Blanche DuBois in the film version of ''[[A Streetcar Named Desire (film)|A Streetcar Named Desire]]'' (1951), with [[Marlon Brando]]]]
Leigh next sought the role of [[Blanche DuBois]] in the [[West End of London|West End]] stage production of [[Tennessee Williams]]'s ''[[A Streetcar Named Desire]]'', and was cast after Williams and the play's producer [[Irene Mayer Selznick]] saw her in the ''The School for Scandal'' and ''[[Antigone]]'', and Olivier was contracted to direct. Containing a rape scene and references to promiscuity and homosexuality, the play was destined to be controversial, and the media discussion about its suitability added to Leigh's anxiety, but she believed strongly in the importance of the work. [[J. B. Priestley]] denounced the play and Leigh's performance, and the critic [[Kenneth Tynan]] commented that Leigh was badly miscast because British actors were "too well-bred to emote effectively on stage". Olivier and Leigh were chagrined that part of the commercial success of the play lay in audience members attending to see what they believed would be a salacious and sensationalist story, rather than the [[Greek tragedy]] that they envisioned, but the play also had strong supporters,<ref>Coleman, Terry, ''Olivier, The Authorised Biography'', Bloomsbury Publishing, 2005, ISBN 0747583064 pp 227-231</ref> among them [[No<U+00EB>l Coward]] who described Leigh as "magnificent".<ref> Holden, Anthony, ''Olivier'', Sphere Books Limited, 1989, ISBN 13579108642; p 312 </ref>

After 326 performances Leigh finished her run; however, she was soon engaged for the [[A Streetcar Named Desire (film)|film version]]. Her irreverent and often bawdy sense of humour allowed her to establish a rapport with her co-star [[Marlon Brando]], but she had difficulty with the director [[Elia Kazan]], who did not hold her in high regard as an actress. He later commented that "she had a small talent", but as work progressed, he became "full of admiration" for "the greatest determination to excel of any actress I've known. She'd have crawled over broken glass if she thought it would help her performance." Leigh found the role gruelling and commented to the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', "I had nine months in the theatre of Blanche DuBois. Now she's in command of me."<ref>Coleman, Terry, ''Olivier, The Authorised Biography'', Bloomsbury Publishing, 2005, ISBN 0747583064 pp 233-236</ref> The film won glowing reviews for her, and she won a second [[Academy Award for Best Actress]], a [[British Academy of Film and Television Arts|BAFTA]] Award and a [[New York Film Critics Circle Award for Best Actress]]. Tennessee Williams commented that Leigh brought to the role "everything that I intended, and much that I had never dreamed of", but in later years, Leigh would say that playing Blanche DuBois "tipped me over into madness".<ref> Holden, Anthony, ''Olivier'', Sphere Books Limited, 1989, ISBN 13579108642; pp 312-313 </ref>

==Continuing illness==
In 1951, Leigh and Olivier performed two plays about [[Cleopatra]], [[William Shakespeare]]'s ''[[Antony and Cleopatra]]'' and [[George Bernard Shaw]]'s ''[[Caesar and Cleopatra]]'', alternating the play each night and winning good reviews. They took the productions to New York, where they performed a season at the [[Ziegfeld Theatre]] into 1952. The reviews there were also mostly positive, but the critic [[Kenneth Tynan]] angered them when he suggested that Leigh's was a mediocre talent which forced Olivier to compromise his own. Tynan's diatribe almost precipitated another collapse; Leigh, terrified of failure and intent on achieving greatness, obsessed over his comments, while ignoring the positive reviews of other critics.<ref>Edwards, Anne. ''Vivien Leigh, A Biography'', Coronet Books, 1978 edition. ISBN 034023024x pp 196-197 </ref>

In January 1953 Leigh travelled to [[Sri Lanka|Ceylon]] to film ''[[Elephant Walk]]'' with [[Peter Finch]]. Shortly after filming commenced, she suffered a breakdown, and [[Paramount Studios]] replaced her with [[Elizabeth Taylor]]. Olivier returned her to their home in England, where between periods of incoherence, Leigh told him that she was in love with Finch, and had been having an affair with him. She gradually recovered over a period of several months. [[Image:LaurenceOlivierVivienLeighinTitusAndronicus1957.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Olivier and Leigh in the 1955 production of ''Titus Andronicus'']]
As a result of this episode, many of the Oliviers' friends learnt of her problems. [[David Niven]] said she had been "quite, quite mad", and in his diary [[No<U+00EB>l Coward]] expressed surprise that "things had been bad and getting worse since 1948 or thereabouts."<ref>Coleman, Terry, ''Olivier, The Authorised Biography'', Bloomsbury Publishing, 2005, ISBN 0747583064 pp 254-263</ref>

Leigh recovered sufficiently to play ''[[The Sleeping Prince]]'' with Olivier in 1953, and in 1955 they performed a season at [[Stratford-upon-Avon]] in Shakespeare's ''[[Twelfth Night]]'', ''[[Macbeth]]'' and ''[[Titus Andronicus]]''. They played to capacity houses and attracted generally good reviews, Leigh's health seemingly stable. [[No<U+00EB>l Coward]] wrote the play ''[[South Sea Bubble]]'' for her, but she became pregnant and withdrew from the production. Several weeks later, she miscarried and entered a period of depression that lasted for months. She joined Olivier for a European tour with ''Titus Andronicus'', but the tour was marred by Leigh's frequent outbursts against Olivier and other members of the company. After their return to London, her former husband Leigh Holman, who continued to exert a strong influence over her, stayed with the Oliviers and helped calm her.

In 1958, considering her marriage to be over, Leigh began a relationship with the actor [[John Merivale|Jack Merivale]], who knew of Leigh's medical condition and assured Olivier he would care for her. She achieved a success in 1959 with the No<U+00EB>l Coward comedy ''Look After Lulu'', with ''The Times'' critic describing her as "beautiful, delectably cool and matter of fact, she is mistress of every situation."<ref>Edwards, Anne. ''Vivien Leigh, A Biography'', Coronet Books, 1978 edition. ISBN 034023024x pp 219-234 and 239</ref>

In 1960 she and Olivier divorced, and Olivier married the actress [[Joan Plowright]]. In his autobiography he discussed the years of problems they had experienced because of Leigh's illness, writing, "Throughout her possession by that uncannily evil monster, manic depression, with its deadly ever-tightening spirals, she retained her own individual canniness &ndash; an ability to disguise her true mental condition from almost all except me, for whom she could hardly be expected to take the trouble."<ref>[[Laurence Olivier|Olivier, Laurence]], ''Confessions Of an Actor'', Simon and Schuster, 1982, ISBN 0140068880 p 174 </ref>

==Final years and death==
[[Image:Vivien Leigh 1958.jpg|left|thumb|200px|Leigh photographed in 1958]]
Merivale proved to be a stable influence for Leigh, but despite her apparent contentment she was quoted by [[Radie Harris]] as confiding that she "would rather have lived a short life with Larry [Olivier] than face a long one without him". <ref> Walker, Alexander. ''Vivien, The Life of Vivien Leigh'', Grove Press, 1987. ISBN 0802132596 p290 </ref>
Her first husband, Leigh Holman, also spent considerable time with her. Merivale joined her for a tour of Australia, New Zealand and [[Latin America]] that lasted from July 1961 until May 1962, and Leigh enjoyed positive reviews without Olivier sharing the spotlight with her. Though she was still beset by bouts of depression, she continued to work in the theatre and in 1963 won a [[Tony Award]] for Best Actress in a Musical for her role in the Broadway musical ''[[Tovarich]]''. She also appeared in the films ''[[The Roman Spring of Mrs. Stone]]'' (1961) and ''[[Ship of Fools (film)|Ship of Fools]]'' (1965).<ref>Edwards, Anne. ''Vivien Leigh, A Biography'', Coronet Books, 1978 edition. ISBN 034023024x pp 266-272 </ref>

In May 1967 she was rehearsing to appear with [[Michael Redgrave]] in [[Edward Albee]]'s ''[[A Delicate Balance]]'' when she became ill with tuberculosis but, after resting for several weeks, seemed to be recovering. On the night of July 7, Merivale left her as usual, to perform in a play, and returned home around midnight to find her asleep. About thirty minutes later (by now [[July 8]]), he returned to the bedroom and discovered her body on the floor. <ref>[http://www.findadeath.com/Deceased/l/Vivien%20Leigh/DC.JPG Vivien Leigh's death certificate] </ref> She had been attempting to walk to the bathroom, and as her lungs filled with liquid, she had collapsed.<ref>Edwards, Anne. ''Vivien Leigh, A Biography'', Coronet Books, 1978 edition. ISBN 034023024x pp 304-305 </ref> Merivale contacted Olivier, who was receiving treatment for [[prostate cancer]] in a nearby hospital. In his autobiography, Olivier described his "grievous anguish" as he immediately travelled to Leigh's residence, to find that Merivale had moved her body onto the bed. Olivier paid his respects, and "stood and prayed for forgiveness for all the evils that had sprung up between us", <ref>[[Laurence Olivier|Olivier, Laurence]], ''Confessions Of an Actor'', Simon and Schuster, 1982, ISBN 0140068880 pp 273-274</ref>before helping Merivale make funeral arrangements.

She was [[cremation|cremated]], and her ashes were scattered on the lake at her home, Tickerage Mill, near [[Blackboys]], [[East Sussex]], England. A memorial service was held at [[St Martin-in-the-Fields]], with a final tribute read by [[John Gielgud]]. In the United States, she became the first actress honoured by "The Friends of the Libraries at the [[University of Southern California]]". The ceremony was conducted as a memorial service, with selections from her films shown and tributes provided by such associates as [[George Cukor]].<ref>Edwards, Anne.

==Critical comments==
Vivien Leigh was considered one of the most beautiful actresses of her day, and her directors emphasised this in most of her films. When asked if she believed her beauty had been a handicap, she said, "people think that if you look fairly reasonable, you can't possibly act, and as I only care about acting, I think beauty can be a great handicap, if you really want to look like the part you're playing, which isn't necessarily like you."<ref>[http://www.vivien-leigh.com/interview.html ''Actors Talk About Acting'' - Vivien Leigh interview (1961)] Edited by John E.

[[George Cukor]] commented that Leigh was a "consummate actress, hampered by beauty",<ref>Shipman, David, ''Movie Talk'', St Martin's Press, 1988. ISBN 0312034032; p 126 </ref> and Laurence Olivier said that critics should "give her credit for being an actress and not go on forever letting their judgements be distorted by her great beauty."<ref>Coleman, Terry, ''Olivier, The Authorised Biography'', Bloomsbury Publishing, 2005, ISBN 0747583064 p 227</ref> [[Garson Kanin]] shared their viewpoint and described Leigh as "a stunner whose ravishing beauty often tended to obscure her staggering achievements as an actress. Great beauties are infrequently great actresses &ndash; simply because they don't need to be. Vivien was different; ambitious, persevering, serious, often inspired."<ref>Shipman, David, ''Movie Talk'', St Martin's Press, 1988. ISBN 0312034032; p 125 </ref>

Leigh explained that she played "as many different parts as possible" in an attempt to learn her craft and to dispel prejudice about her abilities. She believed that comedy was more difficult to play than drama because it required more precise timing, and said that more emphasis should be placed upon comedy as part of an actor's training. Nearing the end of her career, which ranged from [[No<U+00EB>l Coward]] comedies to Shakespearean tragedies, she observed, "It's much easier to make people cry than to make them laugh."<ref>[http://www.vivien-leigh.com/interview.html ''Actors Talk About Acting'' - Vivien Leigh interview (1961)] Edited by John E. Boothe and Lewis Funke. Retrieved January 7, 2006</ref>

Her early performances brought her immediate success in Britain, but she remained largely unknown in other parts of the world until the release of ''Gone with the Wind''. In December 1939 the ''[[New York Times]]'' wrote, "Miss Leigh's Scarlett has vindicated the absurd talent quest that indirectly turned her up. She is so perfectly designed for the part by art and nature that any other actress in the role would be inconceivable"<ref>Haver, Ronald. ''David O. Selznick's Hollywood'' Bonanza Books, New York, 1980. ISBN 0517476657; p 305</ref>, and as her fame escalated, she was featured on the cover of ''[[Time Magazine]]'' as Scarlett. In 1969 critic [[Andrew Sarris]] commented that the success of the film had been largely due to "the inspired casting" of Leigh,<ref>[http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20000101/CRITICALDEBATE/40310036 Roger Ebert.com] quoting [[Andrew Sarris]], ''The American Cinema: Directors and Directions 1929-1968'', retrieved January 6, 2006. </ref> and in 1998 wrote that "she lives in our minds and memories as a dynamic force rather than as a static presence."<ref> [http://www.nytimes.com/books/98/05/03/reviews/980503.03woodlt.htmland ''New York Times - Reviews on the Web''] Quoting [[Andrew Sarris]] in ''You Ain't Heard Nothin' Yet, The American Talking Film: History & Memory, 1927-1949''. May 3, 1998. Retrieved January 11, 2006. </ref>
[[Leonard Maltin]] described the film as one of the all-time greats, writing in 1998 that Leigh "brilliantly played" her role.<ref>[[Leonard Maltin|Maltin, Leonard]], ''1998 Movie and Video Guide'', Signet Books, 1997, p 522</ref>

Her performance in the [[West End of London|West End]] production of ''A Streetcar Named Desire'', described by the theatre writer [[Phyllis Hartnoll]] as "proof of greater powers as an actress than she had hitherto shown", led to a lengthy period during which she was considered one of the finest actresses in British theatre.<ref>[[Phyllis Hartnoll|Hartnoll, Phyllis]], ''The Concise Companion to the Theatre'', Omega Books, 1972, ISBN 185007044X, p 301 </ref> Discussing the subsequent film version, [[Pauline Kael]] wrote that Leigh and [[Marlon Brando]] gave "two of the greatest performances ever put on film" and that Leigh's was "one of those rare performances that can truly be said to evoke both fear and pity."<ref>[[Pauline Kael|Kael, Pauline]], ''5001 Nights At The Movies'', Zenith Books, 1982, ISBN 0099335506; p 564 </ref>

Kenneth Tynan ridiculed Leigh's performance opposite Olivier in the 1955 production of ''[[Titus Andronicus]]'', commenting that she "receives the news that she is about to be ravished on her husband's corpse with little more than the mild annoyance of one who would have preferred foam rubber."<ref>[http://www.guardian.co.uk/arts/curtainup/story/0,12830,984310,00.html Guardian Unlimited] Ellis, Samantha, for ''[[The Guardian]]'', June 23, 2003 (quoting Kenneth Tynan). Retrieved January 7, 2005</ref> He was one of several critics to react negatively to her reinterpretation of [[Lady Macbeth (Shakespeare)|Lady Macbeth]] in 1955, saying that her performance was insubstantial and lacked the necessary fury demanded of the role; however, after her death he revised his opinion, describing his earlier criticism as "one of the worst errors of judgement" he had ever made. He came to believe that Leigh's interpretation, in which Lady Macbeth uses her sexual allure to keep Macbeth enthralled, "made more sense ... than the usual battle-axe" portrayal of the character. In a survey of theatre critics conducted shortly after Leigh's death, several named it as one of her greatest achievements in theatre.<ref> Taylor, John Russell. ''Vivien Leigh'', Elm Tree Books, 1984. ISBN 0241113334 p 99 </ref>

In 1969 a plaque to Leigh was placed in the actor's church, [[St Paul's, Covent Garden]], and in 1985 a portrait of her was included in a series of [[postage stamp]]s, along with [[Alfred Hitchcock]], [[Charles Chaplin]], [[Peter Sellers]] and [[David Niven]] to commemorate "British Film Year". <ref> Walker, Alexander.

The [[British Library]] in London purchased the papers of Laurence Olivier from his estate in 1999. Known as ''The Laurence Olivier Archive'', the collection includes many of Vivien Leigh's personal papers, including numerous letters written by her to Olivier. The papers of Vivien Leigh, including letters, photographs, contracts and diaries, are owned by her daughter, Mrs Suzanne Farrington. In 1994 the [[National Library of Australia]] purchased a photograph album, monogrammed "L & V O" and believed to have belonged to the Oliviers, containing 573 photographs of the couple during their 1948 tour of Australia. It is now held as part of the record of the history of the performing arts in Australia.<ref> [http://www.nla.gov.au/pub/gateways/archive/14/14.html#laurieviv National Library of Australia &ndash; ''Gateways''] ISSN 1443-0568 No. 14 March 1995, retrieved January 7, 2006.</ref>
