'''Lockdown (2008)''' was a [[professional wrestling]]  [[pay-per-view]] (PPV) [[List of TNA pay-per-view events|event]] produced by [[Total Nonstop Action Wrestling]] (TNA), which took place on April 13, 2008 at the [[Tsongas Arena]] in [[Lowell, Massachusetts]]. It was the fourth annual event under the [[TNA Lockdown|Lockdown]] chronology. Eight [[mock combat|professional wrestling matches]] were featured on the event's [[card (sports)|card]]. In the tradition of Lockdown events, every match took place inside a steel structure with six sides, known as [[Professional wrestling match types#Cage|Six Sides of Steel]].

The [[main event]] was a Six Sides of Steel cage match for the [[TNA World Heavyweight Championship]], in which [[Samoa Joe]] defeated the reigning champion, [[Kurt Angle]], to win the championship. Following another tradition of Lockdown events, TNA held the annual [[Professional wrestling match types#Lethal Lockdown|Lethal Lockdown match]], which was contested inside a steel structure with a flat roof; in this match, [[Team Cage#The New Team Cage (Lockdown 2008)|Team Cage]] defeated [[Angle Alliance#Setup for the breakdown|Team Tomko]]. Two featured bouts were scheduled on the [[undercard]]. In an [[Professional wrestling tag team match types#Intergender tag team match|intergender tag team match]],  [[Booker Huffman|Booker T]] and [[Sharmell Sullivan-Huffman|Sharmell]] defeated [[Robert Roode]] and [[Bonnie Maxon|Payton Banks]]. The other bout was an [[Professional wrestling match types#Xscape match|Xscape match]] for the [[TNA X Division Championship]], in which six competitors fought to eliminate each other by [[Pin (professional wrestling)|pinfall]] or [[Submission (combat sport)|submission]] until there were two left; the remaining two then fought to escape the steel structure. [[Jay Lethal]] defeated five opponents in this match to retain the championship.

The event marked the fourth time the Lethal Lockdown format was used by TNA, and the first time a [[World Heavyweight Championship (professional wrestling)|World Championship]] was contested in a Lockdown main event. When the event was released on DVD, it reached a peak position of number five on ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard's]]'' DVD Sales Chart. The professional wrestling section of the [[Canadian Online Explorer]] website rated the entire event a 6.5 out of 10 stars, one star higher than the [[Lockdown (2007)|2007 event]].

==Background==
{{see also|Professional wrestling}}
The event featured eight professional wrestling matches that involved different wrestlers from pre-existing scripted feuds, [[Plot (narrative)|plots]], and [[Narrative thread|storylines]]. Wrestlers were portrayed as either [[Heel (professional wrestling)|villains]] or [[Face (professional wrestling)|heroes]] in the scripted events that built tension and culminated in a wrestling match or series of matches. In the tradition of Lockdown events, every match was contested inside a 16&nbsp;foot (4.9&nbsp;m) high steel structure with six sides known as [[Professional wrestling match types#Cage|Six Sides of Steel]].

The main event at Lockdown featured TNA World Heavyweight Champion [[Kurt Angle]] defending the title against Samoa Joe ([[Samoa Joe|Joe Seanoa]]) in a Six Sides of Steel cage match. On the March 13 episode of TNA's primary television program, ''[[TNA Impact!]]'', [[Professional wrestling authority figures#Management Director|authority figure]] [[Jim Cornette]] announced the match for Lockdown.<ref name="SlamImpact313">{{cite web|url=http://slam.canoe.ca/Slam/Wrestling/2008/03/14/4999536.html|title=Impact: Lethal Lockdown begins to take shape|last=Sokol|first=Chris|date=2008-03-14|accessdate=2008-09-07|publisher=[[Canadian Online Explorer]]}}</ref> On the same episode, Joe was scripted to state that he would quit TNA forever if he did not win at Lockdown.<ref name="SlamImpact313"/> He changed this statement on a later episode, saying he would quit professional wrestling forever. Afterwards, Joe did not appear on ''Impact!'' until the April 10 episode where he signed a contract, which made his retirement from professional wrestling official if he lost.<ref name="PWTorchImpact410">{{cite web|url=http://pwtorch.com/artman2/publish/TV_Reports_9/article_25259.shtml|title=Caldwell's TNA Impact report 4/10: Ongoing coverage of Spike TV show|first=James|last=Caldwell|date=2008-04-10|accessdate=2008-07-09|publisher=PWTorch.com}}</ref> During Joe's scripted absence, TNA reported that he was training for his match at Lockdown in California with [[mixed martial arts]] fighter [[Marcus Davis]].<ref name="PWTorchImpact327"/>

Continuing another tradition of Lockdown events, TNA held the fourth annual [[Professional wrestling match types#Lethal Lockdown match|Lethal Lockdown match]]. In this match, one wrestler from each five-member team started in the ring; after five minutes, another wrestler entered, followed two minutes later by a member of the other team. Every two minutes, a new wrestler entered until all ten were in the ring; at this point a ceiling with weapons attached was lowered and [[Pin (professional wrestling)|pinfalls]] or [[Submission wrestling|submissions]] were allowed. On the March 13 episode of ''Impact!'', Cornette announced that Christian Cage ([[Jason Reso|William Reso]]) and Tomko ([[Travis Tomko]]) were the team captains for the 2008 inception; their teams were referred to as [[Team Cage#The New Team Cage (Lockdown 2008)|Team Cage]] and [[Angle Alliance#Setup for the breakdown|Team Tomko]].<ref name="PWTorchImpact313">{{cite web|url=http://pwtorch.com/artman2/publish/TV_Reports_9/article_24845.shtml|title=Caldwell's TNA Impact Report 3/13: Ongoing coverage of Spike TV show|last=Caldwell|first=James|date=2008-03-13|accessdate=2008-07-08|publisher=PWTorch.com}}</ref> Team Cage consisted of Cage, [[Kevin Nash]], Rhino ([[Terry Gerin]]), Sting ([[Steve Borden]]), and [[Matt Morgan (wrestler)|Matt Morgan]], while Team Tomko was made up of Tomko, A.J.

Before Lockdown, Cage and Tomko began a scripted rivalry at the company's February PPV event, [[TNA Against All Odds#2008|Against All Odds]], when Tomko betrayed Cage (who had befriended him at the time) by helping Kurt Angle retain the TNA World Heavyweight Championship against Cage.<ref name="SlamAAO">{{cite web|url=http://slam.canoe.ca/Slam/Wrestling/PPVReports/2008/02/11/4839768.html|title=Against All Odds: Angle still TNA champ|last=Sokol|first=Chris|date=2008-02-11|accessdate=2008-10-30|publisher=[[Canadian Online Explorer]]}}</ref> On the March 13 and 20 episodes of ''Impact!'', Tomko chose Styles and Team 3D, which filled the three spots remaining on his team,<ref name="PWTorchImpact313"/><ref name="PWTorchImpact320">{{cite web|url=http://pwtorch.com/artman2/publish/TV_Reports_9/article_24936.shtml|title=Caldwell's TNA Impact report 3/20: Ongoing coverage of Spike TV show|first=James|last=Caldwell|date=2008-03-20|accessdate=2008-07-08|publisher=PWTorch.com}}</ref> while Cage named two of his three team members: Rhino and Nash.<ref name="SlamImpact313"/><ref name="PWTorchImpact320"/> Sting, who had not been seen on television since November 2007 at TNA's [[TNA Genesis#2007|Genesis]] PPV event,<ref name="SlamGenesis">{{cite web|url=http://slam.canoe.ca/Slam/Wrestling/2007/11/12/4667999.html|title=Booker T the surprise, but Angle still champ after Genesis|last=Sokol|first=Chris|date=2007-11-12|accessdate=2008-09-08|publisher=[[Canadian Online Explorer]]}}</ref> was added to Team Cage on the March 27 episode of ''Impact!''.<ref name="PWTorchImpact327">{{cite web|url=http://pwtorch.com/artman2/publish/TV_Reports_9/article_25042.shtml|title=Keller's TNA Impact live report 3/27:first-ever live edition with Sting's return, Kong match, Angle MMA demo, more|last=Keller|first=Wade|date=2008-03-27|accessdate=2008-07-08|publisher=PWTorch.com}}</ref> On the April 3 episode of ''Impact!'', Team Tomko and Team Cage were both allowed to add one more member to their teams; Team Tomko selected Storm, while Team Cage chose Morgan.<ref name="PWTorchImpact403">{{cite web|url=http://pwtorch.com/artman2/publish/TV_Reports_9/article_25184.shtml|title=4/3 Impact review by Wilkenfeld:A decent story underneath a whole lot of mediocrity|first=Daniel|last=Wilkenfeld|date=2008-04-03|accessdate=2008-07-09|publisher=PWTorch.com}}</ref>
[[Image:Booker T principal.jpg|left|thumb|180px|Booker T was feuding with Robert Roode going into Lockdown.]]

Heading into Lockdown, the team of Booker T ([[Booker Huffman|Robert Huffman]]) and Sharmell ([[Sharmell Sullivan-Huffman]]) were in an on-screen rivalry with the team of [[Robert Roode]] and Payton Banks ([[Bonnie Maxon]]), culminating in an [[Professional wrestling tag team match types#Intergender tag team match|intergender tag team match]], in which male wrestlers and female wrestlers could fight each other legally. At TNA's January PPV event, [[Final Resolution#January 2008|Final Resolution]], Roode accidentally punched Booker T's [[Legit (professional wrestling)|legitimate]] wife, Sharmell, in the plot line, and as a result Sharmell was scripted as having a fractured jaw.<ref name="SlamFR">{{cite web|url=http://slam.canoe.ca/Slam/Wrestling/2008/01/06/4760746.html|title=Styles sides with Angle costing Cage at Final Resolution|last=Xamin|first=Mark|date=2008-01-07|accessdate=2008-07-13|publisher=[[Canadian Online Explorer]]}}</ref> Sharmell subsequently did not appear on ''Impact!'' for several weeks while in the narrative she was healing from the injury. Booker T and Roode competed in two encounters, one at Against All Odds,<ref name="SlamAAO"/> and the other at TNA's March PPV event, [[Destination X (2008)|Destination X]]. After their match at Destination X, Sharmell returned and assaulted Roode and Banks with a leather strap.<ref name="SlamDX">{{cite web|url=http://slam.canoe.ca/Slam/Wrestling/2008/03/10/5280291.html|title=Destination X spotty at best|last=Clevett|first=Jason|date=2008-03-10|accessdate=2008-09-08|publisher=[[Canadian Online Explorer]]}}</ref> On the March 20 episode of ''Impact!'', Cornette promoted an intergender tag team match for Lockdown, in which Booker T and Sharmell would face Roode and Banks.<ref name="PWTorchImpact320"/>

Another main match on the card was the annual [[X Division]] [[Professional wrestling match types#Xscape Match|Xscape match]], in which [[TNA X Division Championship|TNA X Division Champion]] Jay Lethal ([[Jay Lethal|Jamar Shipman]]) defended the championship against Consequences Creed ([[Consequences Creed|Austin Watson]]), Johnny Devine ([[Johnny Devine|John Parsonage]]), Shark Boy ([[Shark Boy|Dean Roll]]), Curry Man ([[Christopher Daniels|Daniel Covell]]), and Sonjay Dutt ([[Sonjay Dutt|Retesh Bhalla]]). In this match, six competitors fought until four were eliminated by pinfall or submission; the two remaining wrestlers fought to escape from the cage, and the first to do so was declared the winner. Each of the challengers fought in qualification matches to determine who would participate on ''Impact!''. In the first qualification match, Curry Man defeated [[Petey Williams]] on the March 13 episode of ''Impact!''.<ref name="PWTorchImpact313"/> Dutt defeated Homicide ([[Nelson Erazo]]) on the March 20 episode of ''Impact!'' in the second.<ref name="PWTorchImpact320"/> In the third match, Devine defeated Alex Shelley ([[Alex Shelley|Patrick Martin]]) on the March 27 episode of ''Impact!''.<ref name="PWTorchImpact327"/> Shark Boy defeated [[Elix Skipper]] in the fourth qualification match on the April 3 episode of ''Impact!''.<ref name="PWTorchImpact403 2">{{cite web|url=http://pwtorch.com/artman2/publish/TV_Reports_9/article_25200.shtml|title=Keller's TNA Impact report 4/3:Matt Morgan, Sting vs. Rhino, Christian & Rhino vs. Styles & Tomko|last=Keller|first=Wade|date=2008-04-04|accessdate=2008-07-09|publisher=PWTorch.com}}</ref> On the April 10 episode of ''Impact!'', Creed defeated Jimmy Rave ([[Jimmy Rave|James Guffey]]) to become the last to qualify.<ref name="PWTorchImpact410"/>

===Preliminary matches===
The Xscape match for the TNA X Division Championship was the first match at Lockdown to air [[Live television|live]] on PPV.<ref name="WVLD">{{cite web|url=http://www.wrestleview.com/news2008/1208141758.shtml|title=Lockdown PPV results - 4/13 - Lowell, MA (Angle vs. Joe, much more)|first=Adam|last=Martin|date=2008-04-13|accessdate=2008-07-09|publisher=WrestleView.com}}</ref> The participants were Jay Lethal, Curry Man, Shark Boy, Johnny Devine, Sonjay Dutt, and Consequences Creed. Devine and Lethal were the last two participants in the match.

The [[Gauntlet for the Gold|Queen of the Cage match]] to become the number one contender to the [[TNA Women's Knockout Championship]] followed, which involved Roxxi Laveaux ([[Nicole Raczynski]]), Angelina Love ([[Angel Williams|Lauren Williams]]), Velvet Sky ([[Velvet Sky|Jamie Szantyr]]), Salinas ([[Shelly Martinez]]), Rhaka Khan ([[Trenesha Biggers]]), Traci Brooks ([[Tracy Brookshaw]]), [[Christy Hemme]], and Jacqueline ([[Jacqueline Moore]]).<ref name="PWTorchLD1">{{cite web|url=http://pwtorch.com/artman2/publish/PPV_Reports_5/article_25284.shtml|title=Caldwell's TNA Lockdown PPV report 4/13:Ongoing "virtual time" coverage of Joe vs. Angle PPV|last=Caldwell|first=James|date=2008-04-13|accessdate=2008-07-09|publisher=PWTorch.com}}</ref> In this match, the participants fought to climb up the cage and into the ring, where the first two to do so had a standard wrestling match. The two women that entered the cage were Love and Laveaux. In the final minutes, Laveaux picked up Love, placed her arm over Love's head, and then fell to a seat position to execute what Laveaux dubbed as [[Professional wrestling throws#Guillotine drop|The Voodoo Drop]]; Laveaux then pinned Love to earn the opportunity to compete for the TNA Women's Knockout Title.<ref name="PWTorchLD2">{{cite web|url=http://pwtorch.com/artman2/publish/PPV_Reports_5/article_25285.shtml|title=Keller's TNA Lockdown PPV report 4/13:Joe vs. Angle, Queen of the Cage, Xscape match, all-cage format|first=Wade|last=Keller|date=2008-04-13|accessdate=2008-07-09|publisher=PWTorch.com}}</ref>

The third bout was a Six Sides of Steel cage match between B.G. James ([[Brian Gerard James]]) and Kip James ([[Monty Sopp]]).<ref name="WVLD"/> B.G. was victorious in the match when grabbed Kip's legs and achieved a position with his shoulders spread to win by pinfall in a pinning attempt called a [[Pin (professional wrestling)#Roll-up|roll-up]].<ref name="PWTorchLD1"/>

The Cuffed in the Cage match for a future TNA World Tag Team Championship match against the tag team champions, [[A.J. Styles and Tomko]], involved the teams of Kaz ([[Frankie Kazarian|Frank Gerdelman]]) and Eric Young ([[Eric Young (wrestler)|Jeremy Fritz]]), [[The Motor City Machineguns|The Motor City Machine Guns]] (Chris Sabin <nowiki>[</nowiki>[[Chris Sabin|Joshua Harter]]<nowiki>]</nowiki> and Alex Shelley), Rellik ([[John Hugger]]) and Black Reign ([[Dustin Rhodes|Dustin Runnels]]), [[The Latin American Xchange]] (Homicide and Hernandez <nowiki>[</nowiki>[[Shawn Hernandez]]<nowiki>]</nowiki>), Scott Steiner ([[Scott Steiner|Scott Rechsteiner]]) and Petey Williams, and [[The Rock 'n Rave Infection]] ([[Lance Hoyt]] and Jimmy Rave) (RNRI).<ref name="WVLD"/> In this match, six two-man teams were locked inside the Six Sides of Steel until eleven of the wrestlers were handcuffed to the cage, while the remaining competitor won the future championship match for his team. While the RNRI were making their way to the ring, Young was injured in a backstage assault by Rellik and Reign and, as a result, Kaz competed in the match alone until Young recovered from his scripted injuries. Rellik, Reign, and RNRI were the last competitors in the match, before Eric Young entered the arena in another [[persona]] named "[[Eric Young (wrestler)#Super Eric (2008)|Super Eric]]". Super Eric then ran to the ring, climbed up to the top of the cage, and jumped off to perform a [[Professional wrestling aerial techniques#Splash|splash]] onto all of his opponents, who were standing together in a group. Afterwards he stood up and handcuffed all of the remaining participants to win Kaz and himself the future championship match.<ref name="SlamLD"/>

Awesome Kong ([[Kia Stevens]]) and Raisha Saeed ([[Melissa Anderson]]) fought the team of [[Gail Kim]] and O.D.B. ([[Jessica Kresa]]) in the next match.<ref name="PWTorchLD1"/> The match ended when Kong attempted to perform a [[Professional wrestling attacks#Spinning back fist|spinning back fist]] on O.D.B., but she ducked, causing Kong to accidentally hit her partner Saeed. Kim then performed a [[Professional wrestling aerial techniques#Missile dropkick|dropkick from the top]] of a padded [[turnbuckle]] on Kong, which allowed O.D.B. to climb to the center of the top rope and execute a splash on Saeed for the pinfall victory.<ref name="PWTorchLD2"/>

===Main event matches===
The next match pitted Booker T and Sharmell against Robert Roode and Payton Banks in an intergender tag team match.<ref name="WVLD"/> Towards the end of the match, Roode held Sharmell for Banks to slap her; Sharmell kicked Roode in the groin and jumped out of the way, causing Banks to slap Roode by mistake. Sharmell followed up on this by rolling-up Banks of for the pinfall victory.<ref name="PWTorchLD1"/>

[[Image:Kurt Angle TNA.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Kurt Angle defended the TNA World Heavyweight Championship against Samoa Joe at Lockdown.]]
The Lethal Lockdown match between Team Cage (Christian Cage, Kevin Nash, Rhino, Sting, and Matt Morgan) and Team Tomko (Tomko, A.J. Styles, Team 3D [Brother Ray and Brother Devon], and James Storm, accompanied by Jacqueline) followed.<ref name="PWTorchLD2"/> The match was supposed to begin with the team captains (Cage and Tomko); it instead began with Cage and Styles, when Styles climbed up the cage wall behind Cage into the ring and jumped from the top of a padded turnbuckle to strike Cage in the back of the head with a [[Professional wrestling aerial techniques#Springboard|flying]] [[Professional wrestling attacks#Elbow smash|forearm strike]]. Styles and Cage fought back and forth for five minutes. At this point, Ray entered from Team Tomko and members from each team followed at two-minute intervals until the final member, Sting, entered the match. A retractable ceiling was then lowered, covered in weapons including a ladder, a table, trash cans, and [[Shinai|kendo sticks]], which the competitors immediately began to use. In the final minutes of the match, while Styles and Cage were on the roof standing on top of a ladder, Storm pushed the ladder over, causing them both to fall and crash through a table, which was set up on the roof by Cage earlier in the match. Storm then climbed down into the cage and hit Morgan over his head with a beer bottle, given to him by Jacqueline from outside the ring. After Storm turned around, Rhino performed a [[Professional wrestling attacks#Spear|running shoulder block]] to Storm's stomach to gain the pinfall victory for Team Cage.<ref name="PWTorchLD1"/>

In the main event, Kurt Angle defended the TNA World Heavyweight Championship against Samoa Joe.<ref name="WVLD"/> Throughout the match, each man countered the other's [[Professional wrestling holds|submission holds]] in an attempt to make them concede defeat. Late in the match, Joe placed Angle on the top of a padded turnbuckle, lifted Angle up, and slammed Angle's back and neck into his shoulder and the mat by using a maneuver dubbed the [[Professional wrestling throws#Muscle Buster|Muscle Buster]]. He then pinned Angle to win his first [[World Heavyweight Championship (professional wrestling)|World Heavyweight Championship]] and to start the longest TNA World Heavyweight Championship reign as of {{CURRENTMONTHNAME}} {{CURRENTYEAR}} at {{age in days|month1=4|day1=13|year1=2008|month2=10|day2=12|year2=2008}} days (April 13, 2008 to October 12, 2008).<ref name="SlamBFGIV">{{cite web|url=http://slam.canoe.ca/Slam/Wrestling/2008/10/13/7184441.html|title=Sting takes title at Bound for Glory|last=Sokol|first=Chris|coauthor=Sokol, Bryan|date=2008-10-13|accessdate=2008-11-23|publisher=[[Canadian Online Explorer]]}}</ref> Marcus Davis presented him with the championship belt, and Joe celebrated as the event came to a close.<ref name="SlamLD"/>

On the episode of ''Impact!'' after Lockdown, Kurt Angle activated an on-screen rematch clause in his contract to fight Samoa Joe for the TNA World Heavyweight Championship on the April 24 episode of ''Impact!''. The next week on ''Impact!'', Angle lost the match after Scott Steiner, who was scheduled to have a TNA Championship match at TNA's next PPV event, Sacrifice, interfered and hit Angle with a lead pipe, allowing Joe to pin Angle.<ref name="PWTorchImpact417">{{cite web|url=http://pwtorch.com/artman2/publish/TV_Reports_9/article_25329.shtml|title=Caldwell's TNA Impact report 4/17:Ongoing coverage of Spike TV show|last=Caldwell|first=James|date=2008-04-17|accessdate=2008-07-09|publisher=PWTorch.com}}</ref><ref name="SlamImpact424">{{cite web|url=http://slam.canoe.ca/Slam/Wrestling/2008/04/25/5380606.html|title=Impact: Joe retains on wacky Impact|last=Sokol|first=Chris|date=2008-04-25|accessdate=2008-11-10|publisher=[[Canadian Online Explorer]]}}</ref> Due to Steiner's interference, Jim Cornette declared the TNA Championship match at Sacrifice would invove three competitors<U+2014>titled a [[Professional wrestling match types#Basic non-elimination matches|3-Way Dance]]<U+2014>between Joe, Steiner, and Angle on the same episode.<ref name="SlamImpact424"/> Before Sacrifice, Angle sustained a legitimate neck injury, which did not allow him to compete in the match.

On the April 17 episode of ''Impact!'', World Tag Team Champions A.J.

Young left midway through the match but later returned as Super Eric to pin Styles and win the match.<ref name="PWTorchImpact417"/> Styles and Tomko later claimed that Young and Super Eric were two different people in the narrative.

James and Awesome Kong at Sacrifice. LAX claimed victory in the tournament after defeating Team 3D in the final round.<ref name="PWTorchSac"/>

Jay Lethal later lost the TNA X Division Championship to Petey Williams on the April 17 episode of ''Impact!'', when Williams executed a contract clause allowing him a X Division Championship match whenever he wanted; Williams pinned Lethal to win the championship in the match.<ref name="PWTorchImpact417"/> Williams won the contract clause at TNA's December 2007 PPV event, [[TNA Turning Point#2007|Turning Point]].<ref name="SlamTP">{{cite web|url=http://slam.canoe.ca/Slam/Wrestling/PPVReports/2007/12/03/4704399.html|title=Chaos rules at Turning Point|last=Sokol|first=Chris|date=2007-12-03|accessdate=2008-09-08|publisher=[[Canadian Online Explorer]]}}</ref>
