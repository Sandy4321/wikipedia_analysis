[[File:Linn Isobarik DMS loudspeaker (with in-built crossover) in a domestic setting.jpg|thumb|200px|The Linn Isobarik DMS (with in-built crossover) in a domestic setting]]
The '''Linn Isobarik''', nicknamed "'''Bariks'''" or "'''Briks'''", is a [[loudspeaker]] designed and manufactured by [[Linn Products]]. The Isobarik is known for both its reproduction of low bass frequencies and being very demanding on amplifiers.

Launched in 1973, the Isobarik DMS, Linn's maiden and flagship loudspeaker was based on and named for the [[isobaric loudspeaker|isobaric loading principle]] invented in the 1950s. The speaker exists also as the Isobarik PMS &ndash; destined for the professional market. Although discontinued in 1992, it remains popular among "flat earthers" <U+2013> fans of the Linn/Naim sound.

== History ==
While other loudspeaker manufacturers sought to outperform each other to produce more quantum bass output from their products, Linn was seeking clear undistorted low frequency bass. Linn theorised a design whose bass could go all the way to [[direct current|DC]] and be without fundamental resonance.<ref name=201111hfn/> The quest for that extra octave of "dry and extended bass sound" and more accurate reproduction resulted in the Isobarik.<ref name=2006apj/>

Linn launched the original Isobarik DMS loudspeaker in 1973,<ref name=majik/> the year following the release of its first product, the [[Sondek LP12]]. "DMS" is the contraction for "domestic monitor system", and is designed to be driven passively in the home setting &ndash; it incorporated a [[audio crossover|crossover]] within the loudspeaker cabinet. The Isobarik PMS ("professional monitor system") loudspeaker launched in 1977, destined for the professional market is without the internal crossover. This latter configuration opens up more wiring and driving options, in particular [[active loudspeaker|active operation]] and [[tri-amping]].<ref name=201111hfn/><ref name=HFFPundated/>

[[File:Linn Isobarik DMS loudspeaker enclosure.png|thumb|right|200px|The Linn-patented cone-to-magnet (in-phase) arrangement in a sealed enclosure, as used in the Isobarik.]]
The Isobarik is so named as it employs the isobaric loading principle invented by [[Harry Olson]] in the 1950s: two bass units are mounted in a sealed container and driven in parallel so as to effectively double the speaker enclosure volume and extend its bass frequency response beyond what would be possible for otherwise identical speakers. Linn used a variant of the isobaric principle and patented the use of two bass drive units ("[[woofer]]s") facing forward in an isobaric arrangement in early 1974.<ref name=201111hfn/>

In 1988, Linn externalised the crossover of the DMS to boards with nominal 4-ohm impedance designed to lie flat at the base of the stands. Upon that change, the original distinction between DMS and PMS disappeared along with the suffix designation.<ref name=201111hfn/> The "DMS" was thus discontinued, although "Isobarik PMS" remained on price lists until the speaker was discontinued in 1992.{{#tag:ref|<small>From Linn UK retail price list May 2001</small>|name=May 2001|group="Note"}}

== Speaker ==
Linn brochures dwell little on performance specifications, mentioning somewhat vaguely that the [[frequency response]] "varies by only a few db from 20Hz to 20KHz with the isobaric loading extending usable bass response to below 10Hz". Linn also claimed "very low distortion" and "high sound pressure levels", without quantification. Recommended amplifier power rating is in the range of 50&ndash;500&nbsp;watts.<ref name=HFFPundated/><ref name=1980ASys/> ''Hi-Fi for Pleasure'' noted that the speakers' impedance, although quoted at 3 ohms nominal, dipped considerably at some parts of the audio spectrum.{{#tag:ref|<small>normal sealed box system resonance at 31Hz was present with a cruelly low characteristic at higher frequencies, with dips to 3ohms, 100Hz, and 2.3ohms, 4kHz. The average value was barely higher than 4, with the 'nominal' value very low at 3ohm. These results show that the speaker represents a very difficult load to drive and will also be critical of the impedance of both the accompanying connecting cable and amplifier output.</small><ref name=HFFPundated/>|group="Note"}} This made the DMS Isobarik very hard for amplifiers to drive, potentially causing many amplifiers' output protection to trip.<ref name=HFFPundated/> Equally, the two heavy woofers in each Isobarik made them twice as power-hungry.<ref name=201111hfn/><ref name=HFFPundated/> Such demands happened to make [[Naim amplification]] the perfect match because of its high current delivery capabilities and its toleration of near short circuits.<ref name=HFFPundated/> The Isobarik was famously used as the acid test for the budget-priced [[NAD 3020]] amplifier at its UK launch.<ref name=1999TNT/> In the 1970s, the DMS Isobarik, available in a number of veneers, sold for <U+00A3>1,000.<ref name=HFFPundated/>

As part of their corporate philosophy, Linn intended significant dealer involvement in customer education and decision-making, and included teaching customers how to listen correctly for musical attributes.<ref name=2006apj/> The trial and evaluation of the product prior to purchase and dealer's expert installation are considered by Linn to be important parts of the value added of their top-end products.<ref name=2006apj/><ref name=HFFPundated/> As such, no instructions were supplied with the product.<ref name=HFFPundated/> The Isobaric PMS retailed at <U+00A3>2,400 including stands in May 1991, and the 4-ohm crossover was priced at just under <U+00A3>500.{{#tag:ref|<small>From Linn UK retail price list May 2001</small>|name=May 2001|group="Note"}}

=== Design ===
As a three-way loudspeaker system employing six individual drive units, each Isobarik kabinet has two [[tweeter]]s, two [[midrange driver]]s and two woofers.<ref name=earlymanual/> One driver of each frequency range faces forward; a second tweeter and midrange are mounted on the top surface of the enclosure, and one bass unit is hidden from view. While the bass units are isobaric loaded, the midrange is mounted in a terminated [[Acoustic transmission line|transmission line]].<ref name=1980ASys/> Crossover points are set at 375&nbsp;Hz between the woofer and midrange, and 3&nbsp;kHz between the tweeter and midrange.<ref name=1980ASys/> The upward-firing drivers were designed to aid dispersion and improve the off-axis listening experience.<ref name=201111hfn/><ref name=earlymanual/>

The Isobarik, like the Sara and Kan that were developed in the 1970s and 80s, was designed to work best near room boundaries.<ref name=20110124stereophile/> Manufacturer's leaflets advise positioning of the speaker close to a rear wall and approximately {{convert|2|to|3|ft|cm|-1}} from corners.<ref name=HFFPundated/><ref name=earlymanual/> The trade-off is the less than solid [[stereo imaging|stereo image]].<ref name=201111hfn/> Linn declared forthrightly that loudspeakers that were not designed to work tight against a wall were without merit. According to Art Dudley of ''Stereophile'', Linn also maintained provocatively that "anyone who would design, manufacture, buy, sell, or positively review a loudspeaker made to be installed away from room boundaries was a fool".<ref name=20110124stereophile/>

In early product manuals, Linn recommended using the Isobarik PMS in tri-amped configuration with Naim amplifiers.<ref name=201111hfn/> Three NAP 250 amplifiers, fed by a 3-way Naim electronic crossover, would typically be used, one for each pair of the doubled-up treble, midrange and bass units.<ref name=198002PHFtriamp/> From its introduction in 1984, the monaural NAP 135 can be used in a "6-pack" configuration.<ref name=200606tntwheeler/>

After Linn had started manufacturing electronics and upon the release of the Isobarik Aktiv crossover, Linn declared that the 'AKTIV' system comprises: the source components plus one Linn LK1 preamplifier, one Linn Aktiv Isobarik crossover, three Linn LK2 power amplifiers, one pair of Linn Isobarik loudspeakers and the necessary cables.<ref name=aktivmanual/>

=== Construction ===
[[File:Linn Products D20-LP-1 tweeter, sourced from Hiquphon in Denmark.jpg|thumb|Late Isobarik tweeter, Linn D20-LP-1 with the concentric circles and Linn logo, sourced from Hiquphon in Denmark]]The [[loudspeaker enclosure|loudspeaker cabinet]] measures {{convert|15|xx|15|xx|30|in|cm}}.<ref name=earlymanual/> The extremely rigid 55-litre cabinet is constructed using 19mm high-density [[particle board]] that is strategically damped in places, and extensively braced.<ref name=HFFPundated/> According to the manufacturer, there is an array of stressed steel rods inside the enclosure to control energy flows. The techniques employed ensure that energy that would have caused the unwanted motion of the front panel and drivers is cancelled by a similar but opposite energy from the upward facing units, resulting in the minimum amount of resonances.<ref name=1980ASys/> The cabinets were initially made by Linn in their own factory, but the manufacturing was later outsourced to furniture-makers Leon Levin of Glasgow.<ref name=201111hfn/>

Although the speaker uses bought-in drivers, they have been rebuilt using stronger materials. Drivers' metal baskets are treated to reduce the effects of vibration, and the enclosure designed and constructed to control energy.<ref name=1980ASys/> The drive units (T27, B110 and B139) were sourced from [[KEF]] in kit form, and two KEFKIT3 kits were judiciously used for each cabinet.<ref name=201111hfn/>{{#tag:ref|<small>"LF Unit: B139 Type SP1044; MF Unit: B110 Type SP1003; HF Unit T27 Type SP1032; Crossover: DN12 Type SP1004; Nominal Impedance: 8 ohms; Specific Frequency Response: + or - 3db 35-30,000 Hz measured at 1m on the axis of the HF unit in anechoic conditions; Dividing Frequencies: 400 Hz and 3,500 Hz; Sensitivity: 9.5 watts into 8 ohms produces 96 db at 1 metre in anechoic conditions."</small><ref name=kefkits/>|group="Note"}} However, Linn found the T27 tweeter too fragile and replaced it with the more robust and better-sounding D2008 from Scan-Speak after a very short run;<ref name=201111hfn/> the Scan-Speak tweeter was later changed to a Linn D20-LP-1, sourced from Hiquphon in Denmark.<ref name=201111hfn/>{{#tag:ref|<small>hiquphon consider this equivalent to their OW1-92</small>|group="Note"}} The midrange KEF B110, known for its use in the [[LS3/5A]] BBC monitor,<ref name=kefhistory/> is a 100mm-diameter unit to which Linn applied a layer of doping.{{#tag:ref|<small>From 1984 onwards, new polypropylene cones of the B110 obviated further doping</small>|group="Note"}} The woofer is a KEF B139.<ref name=HFFPundated/>

Each unit of the Isobarik cabinet weighs {{convert|40|kg|lb}}, and is designed to be placed on stands that are {{convert|33|cm}} tall so that the tweeter is positioned at the listener's ear-level.<ref name=HFFPundated/> The speaker is supplied with heavy stands made from welded square cross-section tubing, to which top and bottom spikes are fitted prior to positioning the speaker cabinet.<ref name=standsmanual/>

Input connections are established through 3-pin [[XLR connector]]s.<ref name=HFFPundated/> Later versions and the PMS version have [[banana connector|banana socket]]s (see [[:File:Linn Isobarik loudspeaker crossover from 1988 - Andrea12.jpg|image]]).

=== Reception ===
Like other Linn products, the Isobarik loudspeaker has always received polarised opinions, although ''Hi-fi News'' noted that the speaker kept its promise by managing to "play the lowest bass guitar notes cleanly and give an impression of unlimited bass extension".<ref name=201111hfn/><ref name=198002PHFisobar/> The Linn/Naim triamped active system, using a LP12 source, [[Naim Audio amplification|Naim amplification]] and [[active crossover|electronic crossover]]s together with the Isobarik PMS, was regarded as the pinnacle of "flat-earther" hi-fi systems,<ref name=198002PHFtriamp/><ref name=198002PHFisobar/> and the speaker is integral to the general aura of mysticism that went with the Linn/Naim equipment.<ref name=201111hfn/>

== Other Isobarik products ==
[[File:Linn Kan.jpg|thumb|150px|The Linn Kan, which shares two of the drive units of the Isobarik]]The Isobarik Sara is a product concurrent with the PMS for the whole of its life. This 2-way, 4-ohm, design was a physically much smaller product &ndash; measuring {{convert|425|*|332|*|244|mm|in|abbr=on}} &ndash; that required tall speaker stands. Launched in 1978, it was Linn's entry-level loudspeaker until the Kan (a non-isobaric bookshelf speaker using the same Linn D20-LP-1 and KEF B110 drive units as its big brother) was released. The Kan was discontinued in 1990.<ref name=linnsara9/>

In the late 1980s, Linn worked on a replacement for the Isobarik. The project bearing the codename "Isobarik LS2000" became the Keltik.<ref name=legendstory/> Although the final product does not bear the Isobarik name, the technology was mentioned in marketing materials and the product manual.<ref name=keltik/> Other products bearing the trade-marked "Isobarik" name include the Melodik Active Isobarik Bass and the Majik Isobarik (2011&ndash; )<ref name=remastered/>
