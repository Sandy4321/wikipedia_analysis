==Critical reception==
"Rude Boy" was met with generally positively by music critics. Alexis Petridis of ''[[The Guardian]]'' commented that "Rude Boy", along with the albums previous single "[[Hard (song)|Hard]]", was one of the highlights of ''Rated R'', saying "both of which exploit Rihanna's most appealing vocal style, a sulky, icy, monotone."<ref name="Petridis">{{cite news|last=Petridis|first=Alexis|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2009/nov/19/rihanna-cd-review|title=Rihanna: Rated R|work=[[The Guardian]]|publisher=Guardian News and Media|date=2009-11-19|accessdate=2011-08-09}}</ref> ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''{{'}} reviewer [[Ann Powers]] stated that the song has a  "[[ragga|ragamuffin]]-style", as well as commenting on the lyrics of the song, stating "Even as she offers herself in no uncertain terms -- "I'm gon' let you be the captain tonight," she sneers -- she questions his prowess. "Can you get it up? Are you big enough?" she repeats in the singsong chorus, making it tough to imagine that any suitor could rise to this occasion."<ref name="Powers"/> Bill Lamb of [[About.com]] praised the song, calling it "the most instantly engaging song from the album Rated R", and that "[Rihanna] projects a dominant female image that is exactly what was needed to move past the unfortunate [[Chris Brown (American singer)|Chris Brown]] chapter in her career".<ref name="About.com"/> However, Lamb added that the "icy feel is wearing thin. Rihanna sounds like she has taken a few steps back to distance herself from the whole song. There is a pleasing swagger, but we're never quite engaged".<ref name="About.com"/> The reviewer for ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' wrote, "with 'Rude Boy', Rihanna delivers her most provocative lyrics and perhaps most authentic-sounding single to date. The singer makes good use of the song's title <U+2013> an old Jamaican slang term for lawless males <U+2013> and relishes her role as antagonist. [[Steel drum]]s are a welcome presence on the production, which gives a nod to [[ska]] and [[dancehall]]. Rihanna's swagger has never been as convincing as on this song, and thanks to an accompanying video that pays tribute to [[M.I.A. (artist)|M.I.A.'s]] global pop culture references, 'Rude Boy' is poised for success."<ref name="Reuters">{{cite news|url=http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE61P5PO20100226|title=Billboard singles reviews: Rihanna, Ke$ha|work=''[[Reuters]]''|publisher=[[Thomson Reuters]]|date=2010-02-26|accessdate=2010-03-09}}</ref> Nick Levine also reviewed the song positively, writing, "On the one hand, 'Rude Boy' can be construed as a winning synthesis of her Island-pop beginnings, the effortless hitmaking of the ''Good Girl Gone Bad'' era and the more menacing persona she's unveiled post-Grammygate. On the other, it's just a damn good tune...it's the most instantly catchy moment from her ''Rated R'' album, a dancehall-inflected delight that takes all of ten seconds to get to the hook."<ref name="Nick Levine"/>

===Reception===
Upon the videos release, several media outlets noticed a resemblance between the colorful aesthetics of "Rude Boy" and British singer-songwriter and rapper [[M.I.A.

They tore down my video &nbsp;....&nbsp; [M.I.A.'s] video<U+2019>s great too. It definitely wasn<U+2019>t trying to rip anybody off at all, it was just our approach and the animation stuff, it had a similar vibe." Matsoukas went on to explain that the inspiration for the treatment of the video did not come from one particular source and comes from a variety of different pop culture icons, and concluded that "We<U+2019>re all inspired by similar elements and it came together in that way."<ref name="M.I.A"/><ref>{{cite web|last=Ryan|first=Chris|url=http://buzzworthy.mtv.com/2010/02/12/new-video-rihanna-rude-boy/|title=New Video: Rihanna, 'Rude Boy'|work=''MTV''|publisher=Viacom|date=2010-02-12|accessdate=2011-08-09}}</ref> The music video was nominated in the 'Best Editing' category at the [[2010 MTV Video Music Awards]],<ref>{{cite news|last=Greenblatt|first=Leah|url=http://music-mix.ew.com/2010/08/03/mtvs-vma-nominations-winners-and-losers/|title=MTV's VMA Nominations: Five surprise winners and losers|work=Entertainment Weekly|publisher=[[Time Inc.|Time]] division of [[Time Warner]]|date=2010-08-03|accessdate=2010-08-14}}</ref> but lost to [[Lady Gaga]]'s "[[Bad Romance]]".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/ontv/vma/2010/best-editing/|title=Best Editing|work=''MTV''|publisher=Viacom|date=2010-09-20|accessdate=2010-11-20}}</ref>
