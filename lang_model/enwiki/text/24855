The '''Old Dutch Church''', officially known as the '''First Reformed Protestant Dutch Church of Kingston''', is located on Wall Street in [[Kingston, New York|Kingston]], New York, United States. Formally organized in 1659, it is one of the oldest continuously existing congregations in the country. Its current building, the fifth, is an 1852 structure by [[Minard Lafever]] that was designated a [[National Historic Landmark]] in 2008,<ref name="kirby">{{cite web|url=http://www.dailyfreeman.com/site/index.cfm?newsid=20161202&BRD=1769&PAG=461&dept_id=74969&rfi=8 |title=Kingston's Old Dutch Church gets national landmark status |author=Paul Kirby |date=2008-10-11 |accessdate=2008-10-14 |work=|publisher=Daily Freeman}}</ref><ref name="doi16">{{cite web|url=http://www.doi.gov/news/08_News_Releases/101408b.html |title=Interior Designates 16 New National Historic Landmarks |author= |date=2008-10-14 |accessdate=2008-10-16 |work=D.O.I. News Release |publisher=U.S. Department of the Interior}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref> the only one in the city. The church's {{convert|225|ft|m|adj=on}} [[Steeple (architecture)|steeple]], a replacement for a taller but similar original that collapsed, makes it the tallest building in Kingston and a symbol of the city.

Lafever's building was described by [[Calvert Vaux]] as "ideally perfect". It is unique among his work as his only [[Renaissance Revival]] church that largely retains the original design, and the only [[stonemasonry|stone]] church he is known to have built. Its interior includes stained glass by [[Louis Comfort Tiffany]]'s company, and an extensive [[M.P. Moller]] [[pipe organ]] After a few early renovations, and the collapse of the higher original steeple, it has remained largely intact since 1892, although there have been continuing issues with one of the walls. One of the congregation's previous churches is across neighboring Wall Street. The church grounds also include a small cemetery with most of the burials predating its construction. Among them is [[George Clinton (vice president)|George Clinton]], a former governor and U.S. Vice President.

The church has been active in Kingston's civic life. During the [[American Revolutionary War|Revolutionary War]] [[George Washington]] paid a visit due to the church's strong support for the [[Patriot (American Revolution)|Patriot]] cause, and wrote a [[Thank you letter|thank-you note]] exhibited in the church today. An annual dinner is held to commemorate the visit. [[George H. Sharpe]] raised a [[American Civil War|Civil War]] regiment at the church, and later erected a monument in the churchyard to those volunteers. [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt]] and members of the [[Monarchy of the Netherlands|Dutch royal family]], among other notables, have visited the church. It has also been the site of memorials to tragedy from the [[assassination of William McKinley|assassination]] of [[William McKinley]] to [[September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks|September 11, 2001]].

==Building==

The church is located on a {{convert|1.4|acre|m2|adj=on}} [[lot (real estate)|lot]] at the east of uptown Kingston. It is a [[contributing property]] to the [[Kingston Stockade District|Stockade District]]. Main, Fair and Wall streets surround it on three sides; the north has some two-story commercial buildings. The old [[Ulster County, New York|Ulster County]] courthouse is just to the northwest, across Wall. Amid a cluster of buildings on the south, across Main Street, is the building the current church replaced, now a [[Roman Catholic|Catholic]] church. Most of the neighboring buildings support the church's historic character, dating to the 19th or early 20th centuries.<ref name="nhlnom"/>

Tall shade trees surround the building and shelter its cemetery. An iron fence with stone posts encircles most of the property. [[Flagstone]] walks lead to the primary entrance on the south side and around the building, where another one leads from the tower entrance to Wall Street.<ref name="nhlnom"/>

===Exterior===

The building itself is faced in [[Load-bearing wall|load-bearing]] locally quarried [[bluestone]], set in a random [[ashlar]] pattern with [[limestone]] trim. It consists of a main [[sanctuary]] building oriented north-south with an east-west [[lecture hall]] wing on the north end and attached multi-stage [[bell tower]] at the northwest corner. The [[gable]]d roof is clad in raised-seam metal, with a modillioned wooden [[cornice]]. It is pierced by [[Skylight (window)|skylight]]s corresponding to the exterior windows, currently covered in plastic, justy above the roofline.<ref name="nhlnom"/>

[[window|Fenestration]] on both side profiles consists of five large round-arched [[stained glass]] windows framed by [[molding (decorative)|molded]] limestone casings with [[bracket (architecture)|bracketed]] sills. On the east in the center is an engaged [[buttress]] added to shore up the wall. A three-[[bay (architecture)|bay]] projecting [[pavilion (structure)|pavilion]] on the west supports the bell tower. Its entrance is a single door with round-arched window above and on the sides. Its lowest stage is a three-story masonry tower with wooden cornices separating the stories, topped by three [[framing (construction)|frame]] ones above a curved cornice. The lower two are octagonal, one featuring a clock and the next [[louver]]ed round-arched vents. The uppermost stage, the conical [[Steeple (architecture)|steeple]], has ribs defining its eight facts and is covered with diamond-shaped wooden [[roof shingle|shingles]].<ref name="nhlnom"/> Kingston's city ordinances prohibit the construction of any building taller than its base in the Stockade District.<ref name="Kingston city code">{{cite web|title=Kingston City Code, Article 1 <U+00A7> 264.5|url=http://www.ecode360.com/?custId=KI0280&guid=6724265&j=13|publisher=Ecode|accessdate=July 29, 2009|quote=Because of the visual importance of the Old Dutch Church Steeple, no new structure may rise within the Stockade Area above the base of the steeple, which is 62 feet above curb level.}}</ref>

The lecture hall addition on the north is similar to the main church block. It is a two-story bluestone structure with [[slate]] roof, mostly shielded from view by the church and adjacent buildings.<ref name="nhlnom"/>

A similar projecting gabled [[pavilion (structure)|pavilion]], with battered corners, on the Main Street side frames the main entrance. Two bluestone steps with iron railings lead up to a pair of slightly recessed paneled wooden doors topped by a [[fanlight]] with tracery. The limestone surround is topped with a [[Keystone (architecture)|keystone]]. Limestone is also used for the corner bases and [[course (architecture)|courses]] at ground level and continuing the cornice line at that level. Similarly appointed but smaller doors flank the main entrance.<ref name="nhlnom"/>

===Interior===

In the [[narthex]] a small [[display case]] contains items of significance from the church's history: the first communicants' tablet, and a letter from [[George Washington]] thanking the congregation for its hospitality to him on a 1782 visit (This is reportedly his only writing during the entire eight years of the [[American Revolutionary War|Revolutionary War]] that mentions any religious institution.<ref name="church history page">{{cite web|title=Our Story|url=http://www.olddutchchurch.org/history.php|publisher=Old Dutch Church|year=2008|accessdate=July 24, 2009}}</ref>) Across from the main entrance three round-arched doors corresponding to those on the outside lead into the main sanctuary.<ref name="nhlnom"/>
[[File:Old Dutch church interior 1907 postcard.jpg|left|200px|thumb|1907 postcard of interior]]
The sanctuary itself is painted off-white, with the stained glass windows, red carpeting, [[gilding]] and mahogany trim of the [[pews]] providing a contrast. [[Corinthian order|Corinthian]] columns, creating lateral [[arcade (architecture)|arcades]], provide [[corbel]]ed support to [[groin vault]]s. The arcading partially encloses the balcony. A simulated [[clerestory]] level is illuminated by the skylights supplemented by electric lighting in the original wall [[sconce]]s. The walls themselves are [[Lath and plaster|plaster on lath]] with beaded [[wainscoting]] ending in a chiar rail.<ref name="nhlnom"/>

A raised wooden platform supports the [[pulpit]], [[woodcarving|carved]] with some classical motifs such as rectangular, rounded lozenges and foliation, some of it gilded, echoing the wall behind it. It has two front piers that resemble [[anta]]e. On the wall above the pulpit is a [[Palladian window|Palladian]] Tiffany stained glass window depicting the [[Presentation of Jesus at the Temple]] framed by gilded moldings and flanked by pairs of [[fluting (architecture)|fluted]] Corinthian [[pilaster]]s. Bronze statues of angels are on either side.<ref name="nhlnom"/>

On the south wall is a [[choir loft]] with the church's [[pipe organ]]. It is in a case with another Palladian motif and carvings similar to those in the pulpit, and also framed with fluted Corinthian pilasters. A large swan-necked broken [[pediment]] is atop the case.<ref name="nhlnom"/>

The church's box pews have hinged doors, scrolled armrests and seat cushions. They all face forward on the ground floor except for the two rows in the front. On the upstairs galleries they face the opposite wall. Metal and marble [[commemorative plaque|memorial plaques]] line the walls, and a door on the northwest side leads to the tower vestibule.<ref name="nhlnom"/>
[[File:8GRAVE 03 31 08.jpg|right|thumb|200px|George Clinton's grave]]

===Cemetery===

The remainder of the church lot is given over to its cemetery. It contains around 300 [[headstone]]s, many of which predate the current church. The stonework on many is detailed and high in quality.<ref name="nhlnom"/> 1710 is the earliest date for which one is legible, but church records show burials as early as 1679, and some that have not yet been translated may have taken place earlier. Not all graves were marked. The most recent stone dates to 1832.<ref name="Werner page">{{cite web|last=Werner|first=James W.|title=The Old Dutch Church, Kingston, NY|url=http://jwwerner.com/ODC/OldDutchChurch.html|date=February 1, 2009|accessdate=July 29, 2009}}</ref>

At least 70 of the stones are believed to be Revolutionary War-era veterans. [[George Clinton (vice president)|George Clinton]], former [[Governor of New York|governor]] and [[Vice President of the United States|U.S. Vice President]] under [[Thomas Jefferson]] and [[James Madison]], is buried here under a large [[obelisk]] in the churchyard's southwest corner. He was moved here from [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]] in 1908 and reburied in a full ceremony. Another large monument to "[[Patriotism]]" in the southeast corner honors the volunteers of the 120th New York Infantry during the [[American Civil War|Civil War]]. It was commissioned by [[George H. Sharpe]], a Kingston native and colonel of volunteers for the 120th.<ref name="nhlnom"/>

==Aesthetics==

The Old Dutch Church was one of Lafever's last commissions, and considered his most fully developed application of the [[Renaissance Revival]] style. [[Architectural history|Architectural historian]] W. Barksdale Maynard says it "reveals
an experienced architect at the height of his powers, broadening his approach beyond the [[Greek Revival architecture|Greek Revival]] he had done so much to popularize." The style may have also appealed to the church's congregation as a way of distinguishing itself architecturally within the city from the [[Second Reformed Dutch Church of Kingston]], an offshoot church which had built a new [[Gothic Revival]] church nearby in 1850. It also may have been preferred as it made the church building look older than it actually was.<ref name="nhlnom"/>
[[File:Old Dutch Church front entrance HABS.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Main entrance]]
Lafever abandoned the classical symmetry he had used for earlier churches such as the [[Old Whaler's Church (Sag Harbor)|Old Whaler's Church]] in [[Sag Harbor, New York|Sag Harbor]]  for the church's exterior, preferring the more [[Picturesque]] choice of putting the tower on the side. The projecting front pavilion on the Main Street side creates the appearance of superimposed gables, much like those on the [[Church of San Giorgio Maggiore]] in [[Venice]]. Eclecticism was another aspect of the [[Picturesque]] that showed up in Lafever's design. The battered piers at the corners give the main block and front pavilion a slight [[Egyptian Revival architecture|Egyptian Revival]] feel, as well as adding mass.<ref name="nhlnom"/>

The interior of the church follows [[English Renaissance]] forms popularized by [[Christopher Wren]] and [[James Gibbs]], particularly some aspects of the latter's [[St Martin-in-the-Fields]],<ref name="HABS report">{{cite web|last=Badger|first=William|title=Historical and Descriptive Data, Reformed Protestant Dutch Church|url=http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/ampage?collId=pphhdatapage&fileName=ny/ny1100/ny1146/data/hhdatapage.db&recNum=0&itemLink=r?pp/PPALL:@field(NUMBER+@(ny1146))|publisher=[[Library of Congress]]|page=1|work=[[Historic American Buildings Survey]]|date=Summer 1972|accessdate=August 4, 2009|quote=It has some aspects of James Gibbs St.-Martin-in-the-Fields in London}}</ref> which again may have been chosen by the congregation to distinguish themselves from the Second Reformed Church. By using such a consciously English model, the church's congregation signaled the full [[cultural assimilation|assimilation]] of [[Dutch American]]s, many of whom had continued to speak [[Dutch language|Dutch]] for some years after [[American independence|independence]], into the predominantly [[English American|English-influenced]] culture of the mid-19th century United States. He used a 3:5:7 ratio for the proportions, representing the [[Trinity]], the human [[sense]]s and the [[Creation according to Genesis#The number seven|days of Creation]] respectively.<ref name="church history page" /> [[Calvert Vaux]], when declining a commission for a new pulpit at the church three decades later, called its forms and symmetry, "ideally perfect".<ref name="nhlnom"/>

==History==

The First Protestant Dutch Reformed Church of Kingston has held worship services for 350 years, making it one of the oldest continuously existing congregations in the U.S. The current building is its fifth.

For the first 170 years of its existence it was the only church in Kingston, and the only Dutch Reformed Church for much of the west side of the [[Hudson River]]. Fifty other churches in the region were started under its auspices. Its birth, marriage and death records are complete to 1660, making it one of the oldest such collections in the country and an important resource for [[genealogy|genealogists]].<ref name="Werner page" />

===17th and 18th centuries===
[[File:Old Dutch Church 1679-1752.jpg|right|200px|thumb|Original church building, as it appeared before 1721]]
Like many churches, the Old Dutch Church began with informal meetings, in its case starting around May of 1658, when Kingston was still known as Wiltwyck, part of the [[Dutch colonization of the Americas|Dutch colony]] of [[New Netherland]]. Jacob Stoll, a local settler, led services for 11 others in his house in the absence of an [[ordination|ordained]] minister or actual building. The following year it was formally organized, and in 1660 received its first ''[[dominie]]'', or minister, Hermanus Blom.<ref name="nhlnom"/> A [[parsonage]] was built at the order of [[Peter Stuyvesant]] in 1662. It was used as a school and court as well, and possibly an Indian [[trading post]].<ref name="Werner page" />

Church lore holds that a crude log [[meetinghouse]], built into the [[stockade]] that had been built around the small city,<ref name="church history page" /> was erected near the current location in 1661, although whether it was there has been disputed. Any structure that did exist was destroyed in 1663 during the [[Esopus Wars#Second Esopus War|Second Esopus War]].<ref name="church history page" /> By 1680 a small stone building was in use there. Records of the time describe it as {{convert|60|ft|m}} wide long and {{convert|45|ft|m}} wide. A later history notes that it was extravagantly furnished for the time and place with [[stained glass]] windows bearing [[coat of arms|coats of arms]].<ref name="nhlnom"/>

Services of that era were austere and lengthy, conducted in strict accordance with [[Calvinism|Calvinist]] beliefs. On the Sabbath day, liquor consumption, discharge of firearms and beating of drums were forbidden, with steadily escalating penalties starting at one Flemish [[pound (currency)|pound]]. The church itself was unheated, due to fears of fire. Some congregants brought small stoves to warm their feet in winter. They sat in seats on either side of the sanctuary. A ''Vorleser'' (reader) and ''Vorsanger'' (music leader) assisted the minister. There were no books for the audience since many were illiterate. The church did not have an organ since they were considered a work of the [[Christian teaching about the Devil|devil]].<ref name="Werner page" />

After the [[Second Anglo-Dutch War]], the 1667 [[Treaty of Breda (1667)|Treaty of Breda]] turned New Netherland over to the English, and Wiltwyck became Kingston. The trustees of the Kingston [[land grant|Patent]] generously funded the church, by transferring to it a thousand acres (400 ha) in the north of the town, which the church [[land subdivision|subdivided]] and sold.<ref name="Werner page" />

In 1712 the church requested a royal charter; seven years later it was granted by [[George I of Great Britain|King George I]] in exchange for a [[Peppercorn (legal)|peppercorn]] in rent every year.<ref name="Werner page" /> Two years later, in 1721, it was expanded, early in the half-century tenure of Dominie Petrus Vas. A ''doop huys'', a sort of [[chapel]], was built to handle [[baptism]]s, meetings and other [[Consistory#In Protestant churches|consistorial]] activities. Vas would, three decades later, oversee the construction of a second church building. Surviving prints show a [[gambrel roof|gambrel-roofed]] meetinghouse two bays wide with a tower on the front. Its siding seems to have been [[limestone]] rubble, although the first print shows a material that could be either in a [[course (architecture)|coursed]] [[ashlar]] pattern or [[parging]] to mimic coursed stone. Fenestration consisted of three round-arched windows along the sides. It was dedicated on November 29, 1752, by Georg Wilhelm Mancius, Vas's assistant.<ref name="nhlnom"/>
[[File:Old Dutch Church 1790-1832.jpg|left|200px|thumb|Church following repairs]]
In October of 1777, the church, like many other buildings in the city, was damaged by fires set by [[British Army|British forces]] retaliating against the recently proclaimed capital of the independent state of New York after the [[Battle of Saratoga]]. It was gutted, but the walls still stood. The congregtation strongly supported the [[Patriot (American Revolution)|Patriot]] cause throughout the war.<ref name="church history page" /> In 1782, [[George Washington]], garrisoned near [[Newburgh (city), New York|Newburgh]] to the south, visited the church. He enjoyed his visit enough that he wrote the congregation the letter of thanks currently displayed in its museum.<ref name="nhlnom"/> By 1790 repairs to the church were complete. The tower was rebuilt with a [[cupola]] and clocks on all sides.<ref name="Werner page" />

===19th century===

The first decade of the new century brought change to the church and its community. In 1803 the trustees of the patent decided to sell all their remaining landholdings and [[Dissolution (law)|dissolve]]. Upon completing this task two years later, they disbursed <U+00A3>3,000 to the church. That same year Kingston was formally [[municipal corporation|incorporated]] as a [[Administrative divisions of New York#Village|village]]. In 1808 the village surveyed the property on which the church proper stood and formally conveyed it to the church. The next year, the church began to break with its cultural roots, holding its last services in [[Dutch language|Dutch]].<ref name="nhlnom" />

In 1816 the church established the first [[Sunday school]] in [[Ulster County, New York|Ulster County]]. Its goal was to teach local [[African-American]]s to read the Bible. The church did in this in the context of publicly saying that it looked forward to "the time when people of color will be entitled to the rights of citizenship".<ref name="Church museum page">{{cite web|title=Old Dutch Church Heritage Museum page|url=http://www.olddutchchurch.org/museum.php|publisher=Old Dutch Church|accessdate=August 1, 2009}}</ref>

Burials in the church cemetery stopped in 1830. A [[cholera]] epidemic swept Kingston that year, and as the graveyard filled up quickly the consistory decided against allowing any more. One exception was a woman who died in 1832, possibly the last burial in the churchyard.<ref name="Werner page" />

The church building, too, was reaching the limit of its capacity. The original parsonage was torn down and a new brick church with Romanesque arched windows erected. Its roof was damaged by a [[lightning strike]] in 1840 that tore a large hole in it. No one was present in the church at the time and services were held the next Sunday.<ref name="Werner page" />

Within two decades the new church was already reaching its capacity, with over a thousand congregants. In 1848, a group of parishioners broke away when the [[Classis]] of Ulster denied permission for a new building and formed the [[Second Reformed Dutch Church of Kingston]] two blocks away on Fair Street, ending the Old Church's hegemony over Kingston. This did not adequately relieve the overcrowding. In 1850 the church resolved to replace the old building, which was still suffering the effects of the lightning strike.<ref name="nhlnom" /> The next year the church bought another nearby parcel to enlarge its cemetery, in preparation for the construction of a new building. How they chose Lafever is not known, but in 1852 they began construction of his church, grounding the building in trenches instead of excavating a full cellar, so as not to disturb the graves in the area. The [[cornerstone]] was laid in May.<ref name="Werner page" />

After a year and a half of construction work, costing $33,000 (${{formatnum:{{inflation|US|33000|1852|r=-3}}}} in contemporary dollars{{inflation-fn}}), the church was dedicated in September 1852. The contractors were paid for work beyond the original scope. It is not known whether Lafever ever visited the site or modified his design while construction was underway.<ref name="nhlnom" />

Two years later, its original steeple, at {{convert|239|ft|m}}<ref name="Werner page" /> the tallest in the state at that time,<ref name="church history page" /> crashed to the ground when the roof collapsed during a [[Christmas Eve]] windstorm. The cause was traced to the 50 tons (46 tonnes) of [[slate]] roofing the church elders had substituted for Lafever's [[tin]], creating a [[Structural load|load]] greater than the structure was intended to support.<ref name="nhlnom" />
[[File:1912 reunion of 120th New York Regiment at Old Dutch Church, Kingston.jpg|250px|thumb|right|1912 reunion of 120th New York Infantry at church]]
The church sold the brick building, which it no longer needed. After a few other owners, it became the property of the state, which used it as an [[Armory (military)|armory]]. When the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] started, the church, long active in the [[abolitionist#Abolitionist|Abolitionist]] movement,<ref name="church history page" /> became the center of parishioner [[George H. Sharpe]]'s efforts to organize the 12th New York Infantry. The unit [[Military parade|drilled]] in the armory and fought in battles ranging from [[Battle of Fredericksburg|Fredericksburg]] to
[[Appomattox Campaign|Appomattox]].<ref name="church history page" /> Its [[Regimental colours|battle flags]] hang in the Old Church's narthex.<ref name="Werner page" /> After the war, it was consecrated as St. James Catholic Church

In 1861 the church closed for ten months in order to erect the current steeple. Another structural problem, the shifting of its east wall, had been noticed and was mentioned in a report by the state engineer's office in 1874. It was attributed at the time to the lack of a full basement due to the decision to leave the underlying graves intact. In 1882 the church started another building campaign to address this and other issues.<ref name="nhlnom" />

Not only had the wall shifted, the ceiling had suffered. It was replastered, and the exterior [[buttress]] was built. Lafever's original tin was restored to the roof.<ref name="nhlnom" /> A small stone [[chapel]] was built on the north side.<ref name="Werner page" />

At the beginning of 1892, the church dedicated the new stained glass window, a gift in remembrance of a congregant's parents. Made from [[Favrile glass]] by one of [[Louis Comfort Tiffany]]'s artists, it depicts the Presentation of Christ at the Temple. It was lit at first by gas, and later electricity. It marks the last significant change to the church's interior.<ref name="nhlnom" />

Four years later, in 1896, Sharpe's monument to his volunteers was added to the graveyard. The {{convert|16|ft|m|adj=on}} statue, the work of Byron M. Pickett, was dedicated in a ceremony attended by many of the 120th's former members.<ref name="Werner page" /> It is the only Civil War monument erected to a unit's members by that unit's commander,<ref name="church history page" /> and one of the rare examples of such a war monument anywhere.<ref name="Daily Freeman article">{{cite news|last=Langston|first=Bonnie|title=Old Dutch Church marks milestone|url=http://www.dailyfreeman.com/articles/2009/02/15/life/doc499629c9561ce513567481.txt|publisher=[[Journal Register Company]]|work=[[Daily Freeman]]|date=February 15, 2009|accessdate=August 2, 2009}}</ref> The plot it stands on was reportedly [[deed]]ed to the monument itself.<ref name="Werner page" />

===20th century===

The early 20th century saw several events related to funerary matters. In 1901, the church held one of the official funeral services following the [[Assassination of William McKinley|assassination]] of President [[William McKinley]]. Seven years later, the remains of [[George Clinton (vice president)|George Clinton]], an [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopalian]], were transferred from Washington to the churchyard, where he was reburied with full honors, under the same [[obelisk]] he had originally been buried under, within sight of the steps of the courthouse where he had been sworn in as New York's first governor in 1777.<ref name="Daily Freeman article" /><ref name="Church timeline">{{cite web|title=Chronology|url=http://olddutchchurch.org/chronology.php|publisher=Old Dutch Church|accessdate=August 1, 2009}}</ref> Shortly after the sinking of the ''[[RMS Titanic|Titanic]]'' in 1912, the church held a [[funeral|memorial service]] for the victims.<ref name="church history page" />

The following year a small stone building at the corner of Washington Avenue and Joys Lane, known as Bethany Chapel, was sold to the church. In 1932 [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]], then governor and himself a [[Dutch American]] native of the [[Hudson Valley]], spoke at ceremonies commemorating the 150th anniversary of Washington's visit.<ref name="Werner page" />

Bethany Chapel was sold in 1946, and burned down shortly thereafter. Five years later, when the church needed to expand its facilities again, the small chapel on the north that had been created in 1883 was enlarged to include a second story, with choir room, classroom and kitchen as well. Bluestone sympathetic to the original design was used. The new wing was named Bethany Annex in honor of the chapel building.<ref name="nhlnom" /> The next year, to celebrate the centenary of the church building, Queen [[Juliana of the Netherlands]] and her [[Prince Consort|consort]], [[Prince Bernhard of Lippe-Biesterfeld|Bernhard]], attended services. Her daughter, then-Princess [[Beatrix of the Netherlands|Beatrix]], followed her in 1959, during commemorations of [[Henry Hudson]]'s voyage up the river on the ''[[Halve Maen]]'' and the church's tercentary.<ref name="Church timeline" />

The later years of the 20th century would see more renovations. In the mid-1970s the east wall was shored up again, and the steeple was repainted in its current white from its previous gray.<ref name="Church timeline" /> In 1996 the ''Patriotism'' monument to the 120th was restored.<ref name="Werner page" /> Other historic Kingston buildings benefited from the church's focus on restoration and [[historic preservation|preservation]]. When [[Kingston City Hall (New York)|city hall]] began suffering from neglect in the late 20th century, some congregants removed the surviving [[bas-relief]] plaster [[lunette]]s depicting scenes in the city's history from the building's facade and stored them in the church's basement. They were returned to city hall when it was restored in 2000.<ref name="church history page" />

===21st century===

As with the century just past, the first major event of the new century at the church was an observance of national grief. On the evening of September 11, 2001, it was opened to all members of the community for impromptu services in the wake of [[September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks|that day's terrorist attacks]] on the [[World Trade Center]].<ref name="church history page" />

After several years of restorations and maintenance, the church, with the help of the [[New York State Office of Parks, Recre<ref name="Hinchey 2010 THR story">{{cite news|last=Horrigan|first=Jeremiah|title=Kingston's Old Dutch Church on shaky ground, but aid may be near|url=http://www.recordonline.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20100915/NEWS/9150339|accessdate=September 27, 2010|newspaper=Times-Herald Record|date=September 15, 2010}}</ref><ref name="Hinchey 2010 THR story">{{cite news|last=Horrigan|first=Jeremiah|title=Kingston's Old Dutch Church on shaky ground, but aid may be near|url=http://www.recordonline.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20100915/NEWS/9150339|accessdate=September 27, 2010|newspaper=Times-Herald Record|date=September 15, 2010|location=[[Middletown, Orange County, New York{{!}}Middletown, NY]]}}</ref>ation and Historic Preservation|State Historic Preservation Office]], applied to the [[National Park Service]] (NPS) for [[National Historic Landmark]] status.

Hinchey spoke at the church in 2010 to lobby for passage of a federal [[urban development]] bill which included a $350,000 grant to shore up the church, replacing steel girders which had done that since 2004. At that time the bill had passed the House but not the Senate. The structural problems have been attributed to the graves it was built on.<ref name="Hinchey 2010 THR story">{{cite news|last=Horrigan|first=Jeremiah|title=Kingston's Old Dutch Church on shaky ground, but aid may be near|url=http://www.recordonline.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20100915/NEWS/9150339|publisher=[[News Corporation]]|newspaper=[[Times-Herald Record]]|date=September 15, 2010|accessdate=September 27, 2010}}</ref>

==The church today==

The church and its congregation are "committed to providing worship, education, evangelism, social action, and fellowship", according to their [[mission statement]].<ref name="Mission statement">{{cite web|title=Mission Statement|url=http://www.olddutchchurch.org/mission.php|publisher=Old Dutch Church|accessdate=August 5, 2009}}</ref> It professes its faith thus:

There are several groups affiliated with the church. The Friends of Old Dutch is a [[Non-profit organization|non-profit]] that raises money for the continued maintenance and preservation of the church building.<ref name="Friends of Old Dutch">{{cite web|title=Friends of Old Dutch|url=http://www.olddutchchurch.org/food.php|publisher=Old Dutch Church|accessdate=August 5, 2009}}</ref> Two musical groups, the Kingston Community Singers<ref name="Community singers">{{cite web|title=Kingston Community Singers|url=http://www.olddutchchurch.org/kingston_community_sing.php|publisher=Old Dutch Church|accessdate=August 5, 2009}}</ref> and [[Felix Mendelssohn|Mendelssohn]] Club of Kingston,<ref name="Mendelssohn Club">{{cite web|title=Mendelssohn Club of Kingston|url=http://www.olddutchchurch.org/mendelssohn.php|publisher=Old Dutch Church|accessdate=August 5, 2009}}</ref> rehearse and perform at the church.

==Organ==

By the 19th century, the church's original aversion to organs had abated, and a photo of the interior of the 1832 church from that era shows an organ. When the current church was built, Henry Erben, who had built the [[pipe organ]]s at the First Reformed Church in Albany and [[St. Patrick's Cathedral, New York|St. Patrick's Cathedral]] in New York, was hired to build the new Dutch Church's organ.<ref name="Organ history page">{{cite web|last=Lottridge|first=Barbara|title=The Moller Organ <U+2014> Old Dutch Church, Kingston, NY|url=http://www.chvago.org/Organs/Old_Dutch_Kgn_History.htm|publisher=Central Hudson Valley chapter of American Guild of Organists|year=1998|accessdate=August 8, 2009}}</ref>

Erben's facade and case remain today, but the pipes and internal mechanics were replaced with an [[Ernest M. Skinner|E.M. Skinner]] organ in 1903. It was powered by a water-driven motor, providing a continuous flow of air. The church's consistory had written to the city requesting that [[water pressure]] be maintained on Sundays to allow the organ to function. In 1914 an electric motor was installed to replace the water. A smaller Echo organ was given to the church in 1927.<ref name="Organ history page" />

In the mid-1950s the church decided to recondition the organ. After reviewing several bids, its Music Committee decided to award the contract to the [[M. P. Moller]] company, with a plan for further extensions of the organ. The reconditioned organ was dedicated in 1956 with a recital including [[Johann Sebastian Bach]]'s ''[[Toccata and Fugue in D minor, BWV 565|Toccata and Fugue in D minor]]''. Its [[Organ console|console]] is still in use, after many emergency repairs. A Wicks choir division was added in the next decade.<ref name="Organ history page" />

Another organ subcommitee was formed in 1978 to assess the progress since the mid-century restoration. Its major move was to replace the Wicks choir division, which had never integrated well with the rest of the organ due to a difference in powering methods. It was replaced with a Moller division in 1980. A 1990 committee was able to negotiate another deal with Moller for the completion of the plan.<ref name="Organ history page" />

The next year the Echo organ was removed to make way for the completion of the Moller. The company delivered the final set of pipes and mechanics in late 1991. After they were installed, the expanded organ was rededicated with two recitals in 1992, both including the ''Toccata''. An annual recital series was established that year as well, later with the help of a state [[grant (money)|grant]].<ref name="Organ history page" />

==Bell==

Church lore has it that the first [[church bell|bell]] was made from copper and silver brought by congregants as gifts upon the [[baptism]] of their children. This bell was replaced with a professionally-cast one in 1724, shortly after the second church was expanded. The cost was split between the church and the patent trustees.<ref name="Werner page" />

That bell lasted until the fire started by the British Army in 1777 damaged the church sufficiently for the bell tower to collapse. A replacement bell donated to the church by a Colonel Rutgers, a friend of the congregation, was not popular, as it sounded more like a [[ship's bell]] than a church's. Eventually it was supposedly donated to the courthouse, and Rutgers arranged for the casting of a new bell. The {{convert|540|lb|kg|adj=on}} replacement was brought over from [[Amsterdam]] in 1794.<ref name="Werner page" />

It remained in regular service, tolling not only for services and funerals but also at noon and 8 p.m. daily, until a crack developed in 1888. After that it was rung only for special events and at the remembrances of recently-deceased U.S. presidents, up to [[Woodrow Wilson]]'s death in 1924.<ref name="Werner page" />

Only once since then has it been rung. During [[World War II]], it rang in the [[New Year's Day|New Year]] for 1943. This was broadcast to the [[Netherlands]] via [[shortwave radio]]. That country was [[History of the Netherlands (1939<U+2013>1945)#German occupation|occupied]] by [[Nazi Germany]] at the time, and most of its church bells had been confiscated and melted down for [[mat<U+00E9>riel]]. Those that had not were not permitted to be rung, and the broadcast was thus intended to boost [[morale]] among the Dutch population.<ref name="Werner page" />

After Bethany Chapel burned down following its sale in 1946, the church was able to salvage its 1870 bell from the ruins. It was fully restored in 1974 and is now on display in the church's narthex.<ref name="Werner page" />

==Hobgoblin legend==

Church lore has it that a [[hobgoblin]] haunts the steeple. The story begins with an early ''dominie'' and his wife returning from New York City via the Hudson in stormy weather. As the ship passed [[Dunderberg Mountain]] in the [[Hudson Highlands]], the creature flew out and sat on the foremast, making the ship more likely to [[capsize]] in the rough water. The passengers and crew asked the dominie to pray.<ref name="Werner page" />

He did, and the hobgoblin left. The next morning, its cap was discovered hanging on the church's bell tower. In attempting to get it back, the hobgoblin became imprisoned in the tower, and all succeeding spires. He will remain so, the legend says, as long as the church remains on consecrated ground. Stories claim that a small painter has been seen at work on the steeple during lightning flashes. His moans during Sunday services were mistaken for worshippers [[snoring]].<ref name="Werner page" />

Twice the creature is supposed to have made more direct contact with humans. A painter on the steeple in 1852 died of "[[Lead poisoning|painter's colic]]" when he was scared into a fall off the church, and in 1984 another painter suddenly climbed down after he claimed to have been tapped on the shoulder three times. The hobgoblin is supposed to have added an extra line to the clock face so that "XII" became "XIII".<ref name="Werner page" />
