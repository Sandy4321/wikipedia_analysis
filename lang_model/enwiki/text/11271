The '''Congressional Cemetery''' or '''Washington Parish Burial Ground''' is a historic [[cemetery]] located at 1801 E Street, SE, in [[Washington, D.C.]], on the west bank of the [[Anacostia River]]. It is the only "cemetery of national memory" founded before the [[American Civil War|Civil War]].<ref name = "NHL nom p4"> National Historic Landmark Nomination, p. 4</ref>
Over 22,000 individuals are buried or memorialized at the cemetery, including many who helped form the nation and the city of Washington in the early 19th century.<ref name="congressional cemetery website"/>  

Though the cemetery is privately owned, the U.S. government owns 806 burial plots administered by the [[United States Department of Veterans Affairs|Department of Veterans Affairs]] and Congress, located about a mile and a half to the northwest, has greatly influenced the history of the cemetery.<ref>[http://www.cem.va.gov/cems/lots/congressional.asp Department of Veterans Affairs], Congressional Cemetery Government Lots, accessed April 27, 2012.</ref>

Many members of the [[U.S. Congress]] who died while Congress was in session are interred at Congressional. Other burials include early landowners and speculators, the builders and architects of early Washington, Native American diplomats, Washington mayors, and Civil War veterans. Nineteenth-century Washington, D.C. families unaffiliated with the federal government also have graves and tombs at the cemetery. 

In all there are one Vice-President, one Supreme Court Justice, six Cabinet Members, 19 [[US Senate|Senators]] and 71 [[United States House of Representatives|Representatives]] - including a former Speaker of the House, buried there; as well as veterans of every American war, and the first Director of the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]], J. Edgar Hoover.<ref name="congressional cemetery website">{{cite web |title=Congressional Cemetery Website |url=http://www.congressionalcemetery.org}}</ref> The cemetery was listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] on June 23, 1969 and designated a [[National Historic Landmark]] in 2011.<ref name="NHL designation">{{cite web|title=National Register of Historic Places listings for June 24, 2011|url=http://www.nps.gov/history/nr/listings/20110624.htm|publisher=[[National Park Service]]|date=June 24, 2011|accessdate=June 24, 2011}}</ref>

==Founding and history==
The Congressional Cemetery was established by private citizens on a 4.5 acre plot in 1807 and later given to [[Christ Church, Washington Parish (Washington, D.C.)|Christ Church]], which gave it its official name '''Washington Parish Burial Ground'''. By 1817 sites were set aside for government legislators and officials; this includes [[cenotaph]]s for many legislators buried elsewhere.  The cenotaphs, designed by [[Benjamin Latrobe]], each have a large square block with recessed panels set on a wider plinth and surmounted by a conical point.

[[File:Latrobe_Clinton_LOC_cropped.jpg|thumb|left|Architectural drawing of Vice President [[George Clinton (vice president)|George Clinton]]'s monument by [[Benjamin Latrobe]], 1812.  Clinton was later reinterred in New York.  The monuments to the right appear to be in the form of the Latrobe cenotaphs.]]
From 1823 - 1876 the U.S. Congress funded the expansion, enhancement, and maintenance of the cemetery, but it never became a Federal institution.
Appropriations funded a gravel road from the Capitol to the cemetery, paving within the cemetery, the public vault, fencing, and the gatehouse, as well as funerals for congressmen and the cenotaphs.<ref name = "NHL nom p4"/>  During the early part of this period, graves were laid out in a grid pattern in an extension of the grid in the [[L'Enfant Plan]] for Washington, and little or no landscaping or plantings were made on the grounds.<ref name = "NHL nom p8"> National Historic Landmark Nomination, p. 8</ref> The grid survives to this day and was extended as the cemetery expanded.

[[File:Habs cong cem 200693pu.jpg|thumb|left|Nineteenth century gateway]]
Starting in the late 1840s, the cemetery was influenced by the [[rural cemetery]] movement in which the graves were placed in a park-like setting with extensive landscaping.  To implement this new vision, the cemetery needed to expand.<ref name = "NHL nom p8"/>
Between 1849 and 1869 the cemetery grew in area to 35.75 acres. The original cemetery was located on block 1115 on E Street between 18th and 19th Streets Southeast in 1808.  In 1849, it doubled in size by acquiring the block  to its south, 1116. In 1853, it expanded to the east on blocks 1130, 1148 and 1149 between F and G Streets Southeast. In 1853-53, the cemetery expanded to the west by acquiring block 1104, between 17th Street and 18th Streets Southeast.  In 1858, the cemetery acquired block 1105 and Reservation 13. In 1859, it added blocks 1105 and 1123. Finally, the cemetery reached its current extent of 35.75 acres by growing south to Water Street Southeast with blocks 1106 and 1117 in 1869.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.congressionalcemetery.org/sites/default/files/acquisitionofthesqauresindrawing.pdf|title=Acquisition of the Squares|publisher=Association for the Preservation of Historic Congressional Cemetery|date=2011-01-14}}</ref> Eventually the land to the south of the cemetery was transferred to the [[National Park Service]] although the access road to the RFK Stadium Parking Lot is administered by the DC Sports and Entertainment Commission.  In the 1950s, it appeared that the southeast corner of the cemetery would become a part of the right of way for the [[Interstate 695 (District of Columbia)|Southeast-Southwest Freeway]].  However, protracted environmental litigation halted construction at [[Pennsylvania Avenue]], with the dead end of the freeway being connected by a temporary road to the RFK Parking Lot and to 17th Street Southeast at the southwest corner of the cemetery.

The cemetery is still owned by Christ Church but is now managed by the Association for the Preservation of Historic Congressional Cemetery (APHCC).  In recent years, Congressional has witnessed a turnaround in its situation.  Where the grass was unmowed in 2000, the board now has established an endowment fund that will maintain the lawn in perpetuity.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.congressionalcemetery.org/Research/Newsletters/2000_2009/Newsletter_2007_Fall.pdf |title=Fall 2007 Heritage Gazette Newsletter}}</ref> The Association hosts over 500 volunteers each year working on a wide variety of projects: from planting bulbs to resetting tombstones to pruning trees, doing research, and writing a newsletter. Events hosted by the APHCC have included free guided tours on Saturdays, Christmas caroling, Christ Church's Easter services, and book signings.<ref name="congressional cemetery website"/>

==Monuments and structures==
[[File:ClayCalhoun QRc CC.JPG|thumb|upright=1.1|Cenotaphs of Senators [[John C. Calhoun]] (left) and [[Henry Clay]]]]
The Congressional Cemetery is a National Historic Landmark [[Historic District]] with 9 [[contributing structure]]s and 186 contributing objects built from 1817 to 1876.  Later structures and objects are considered to be "non-contributing" even if they are significant in the cemetery's current appearance.<ref name="NHL p9">NHL Nomination, p.9</ref>
===Cenotaphs===
Of the 186 contributing objects, 168 are the nearly identical Congressional cenotaphs, believed to have been designed by the [[Architect of the Capitol]] [[Benjamin Latrobe]].<ref name="NHL p9"/>  As used at the Congressional Cemetery, the term "cenotaph" includes not only monuments to those buried elsewhere, but also to the Latrobe monuments that mark the actual graves of representatives and senators.  Some congressmen are buried under a cenotaph, some are buried without one in a different area of the cemetery, and for some the marker is a true cenotaph. [[James Gillespie]] (1747-1805) who was reinterred in 1892, has a separate grave and cenotaph.

A cenotaph was erected for each congressman who died in office from 1833 to 1876.  The first was for Rep. [[James Lent]]. After Congress appropriated funds and his monument was ordered, his family reinterred the body in New York.  Congress erected the monument in 1839 anyway, establishing the tradition of erecting cenotaphs.<ref name=ceno/>

The cenotaphs are constructed of [[Aquia Creek sandstone|Aquia sandstone]], as are the [[White House]] and the [[United States Capitol|Capitol]], and were likewise painted white, forming a visual connections with these nearby symbols of Federal government, and a contrast to the surrounding gravestones.  They are grouped in rows in the older part of the cemetery where they dominate the landscape.<ref name = "NHL nom p8"/>

After the Civil War very few congressmen were buried in the cemetery, as their bodies were commonly shipped to their home states or buried in the new [[National Cemetery|National Cemeteries]] such as [[Arlington National Cemetery]]. Cenotaphs were discontinued in 1876 after Massachusetts Senator [[George Frisbie Hoar]] stated that <U+201C>the thought of being buried beneath one of those atrocities brought new terror to death.<U+201D><ref name=ceno>[http://www.congressionalcemetery.org/sites/default/files/WT2%20Cenotaphs.pdf Congressional Cemetery], 2007, Cenotaph Walking Tour, accessed April 3, 2012.</ref>

[[William Thornton]], who served as Architect of the Capitol before Latrobe, is the only person honored with a cenotaph, who did not serve as a congressman.  Former [[Speaker of the House]] [[Tip O'Neill]] was honored with a modified cenotaph in 1994.  After a [[Nicholas_Begich#Disappearance|1972 plane crash]] in which their bodies were lost, [[Hale Boggs]] and [[Nick Begich|Nicholas Begich]] share a cenotaph.  These are the only cenotaphs erected since 1876.<ref name=ceno/>
[[File:Public Vault roses CC.JPG|thumb|left|upright=1.1|The Public Vault]]

===Public Vault===
[[File:DC arsenal cenotaph.JPG|thumb|upright=1.0|Arsenal Disaster Monument]]
The Public Vault  is an early classical revival structure built 1832-34 with Federal funds to store the bodies of government officials before burial.
A classical marble facade with baroque scrolls decorate the partially subterranean vault. Double wrought iron doors have the words <U+201C>PUBLIC VAULT<U+201D> displayed by means of punched out holes.<ref name="NHL p9"/>  Temporary residents of this vault have included three [[U.S. Presidents]]:  [[John Quincy Adams]] (1848), [[William Henry Harrison]] (1841), and  [[Zachary Taylor]] (1850), as well as Adams's wife, [[First Lady of the United States|First Lady]] [[Louisa Catherine Adams]] (1852).  First Lady [[Dolley Madison]] was interned in the public vault for two years, the longest known interment in the vault, while funds were being raised for her re-interment at [[Montpelier (Orange, Virginia)|Montpelier]]. Her body was transferred to a nearby family vault for another six years before the funds were raised.<ref>[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdMtziloE7k American Artifacts: Congressional Cemetery], American History TV, CSPAN3, on YouTube, accessed April 16, 2012.</ref>

===Arsenal Disaster Monument===
In 1864 an explosion at the nearby [[Washington Arsenal]] killed a woman supervisor and 20 teenage girls, most of them Irish, who worked packing explosives and cartridges. President [[Abraham Lincoln|Lincoln]] led the funeral procession to the cemetery and attended the graveside ceremonies.  Later a monument was erected over the graves of 16 of the victims.  A sculpture of a grieving young woman stands atop a marble column on the monument.  Local sculptors, the Flaherty brothers, carved the monument.<ref>NHL Nomination, pp. 11 and 23.</ref>

==Grand funerals==
Several nationally important or otherwise remarkable funerals have taken place at the Congressional Cemetery.  These include those held to honor:
*George Clinton, Vice President, funeral held April 22, 1812.  The procession included President [[James Madison]] as well as the officers and members of both houses of Congress.<ref>[http://www.congressionalcemetery.org/vice-president-george-clinton Vice President George Clinton], reprinted from The [[National Intelligencer]] by the Association for the Preservation of Historic Congressional Cemetery, accessed April 27, 2012.</ref>
*[[William Henry Harrison]], President, 1841.  After services at the [[White House]] the procession included the new President [[John Tyler]] and former President John Quincy Adams, as well as officers and members of the Congress and the state legislature of Maryland, extending over two miles long.<ref>[http://www.congressionalcemetery.org/president-william-henry-harrison President William Henry Harrison], reprinted from The [[National Intelligencer]] by the Association for the Preservation of Historic Congressional Cemetery, accessed April 27, 2012.</ref>

Gilmer]], Secretary of the Navy, Commodore [[Beverly Kennon]], Chief of the Bureau of Construction & Equipment, [[David Gardiner]], former Senator from New York, victims of a February 28, 1844 explosion on the ''[[USS Princeton (1843)|USS Princeton]]''. [[Virgil Maxcy]], Charge d'Affaires of the United States to Belgium was also killed in the explosion, but was buried separately in his family plot.<ref>[http://www.congressionalcemetery.org/secretary-abel-p-upshur-secretary-thomas-wgilmer-commodore-beverly-kennon-hon-david-gardiner-hon-vir Victims of the USS Princeton explosion], reprinted from February 29, 1844 edition of The [[National Intelligencer]] by the Association for the Preservation of Historic Congressional Cemetery, accessed April 27, 2012.</ref>
*[[John Quincy Adams]], former President, former Senator, and Representative, who died in the Capitol, funeral held February 28, 1846.<ref>[http://www.congressionalcemetery.org/president-john-quincy-adams President John Quincy Adams] includes reprints from 1848 editions of the National Intelligencer,  Association for the Preservation of Historic Congressional Cemetery, accessed May 2, 2012. </ref> 
*[[Dolley Madison]], former First Lady, funeral held July 16, 1849. President Zachary Taylor and his Cabinet attended services at [[St. John's Church]] in [[Lafayette Square]], whence the cortege proceded to the Public Vault at the Congressional Cemetery.<ref>[http://www.congressionalcemetery.org/first-lady-dolley-p-madison First Lady Dolley P. Madison] includes reprints from 1849 editions of the National Intelligencer,  Association for the Preservation of Historic Congressional Cemetery, accessed May 2, 2012. </ref> 
*[[Zachary Taylor]], President, funeral held July 13, 1850. Proceeding from the [[White House]], the cortege included the new President [[Millard Fillmore]], the Cabinet, the officers and members of both houses of Congress, numerous military units, and Taylor's favorite horse, Old Whitey. <ref>[http://www.congressionalcemetery.org/president-zachary-taylor President Zachary Taylor] includes reprints from 1850 editions of the National Intelligencer,  Association for the Preservation of Historic Congressional Cemetery, accessed May 2, 2012. </ref>

==Association==
[[File:Chapel Congressional Cemetery.JPG|thumb|upright=1.0|Chapel]]
The cemetery is administered by the Association for the Preservation of Historic Congressional Cemetery, which is a non-profit corporation headed by a 15 member Board of Directors.  The Association has five full time employees and over 500 volunteers.<ref name=p2>{{cite web|url=http://www.congressionalcemetery.org/sites/default/files/2009annualreport.pdf|title=2009 Annual Report|publisher=Association for the Preservation of Historic Congressional Cemetery|date=2011-01-14|page=2}}</ref> Its mission is:
<blockquote>
To serve the community as an active burial ground and conserve the physical artifacts, buildings, and infrastructure of the cemetery; to celebrate the American heritage represented by those interred here; to restore and sustain the landscape, to protect the Anacostia River watershed, and to manage the grounds as an accessible community resource.<ref name=p2/></blockquote>
[[File:Congressional Cemetery 2009 (4).jpg|thumb|upright=1.0|left|Green space at the cemetery]]
In 2009, the Association retained the  Oehme, van Sweden & Associates to develop a new landscape plan.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.congressionalcemetery.org/sites/default/files/2009annualreport.pdf|title=2009 Annual Report|publisher=Association for the Preservation of Historic Congressional Cemetery|date=2011-01-14|page=10}}</ref>

===K-9 Corps===
Congressional Cemetery is also known for allowing members of the APHCC to walk dogs off-leash on the cemetery grounds. In addition to their membership dues, '''K-9 Corps''' members pay a fee for the privilege of walking their dogs. K-9 Corps members provide about one-third of Congressional Cemetery's operating income. Dog walkers follow a set of rules and regulations and provide valuable volunteer time to restore the cemetery.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cemeterydogs.org |title=Cemetery Dogs}}</ref>

The K-9 Corps program is recognized as providing the impetus for the revitalization of Congressional Cemetery, which had fallen into neglect prior to the program's creation.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/12/21/AR2006122101127.html |title=Congressional Cemetery's Slow Resurrection | work=The Washington Post | first=Ryan | last=Holeywell | date=December 22, 2006 | accessdate=April 30, 2010}}</ref> In 2008, the Association restricted K-9 membership, placing restrictions on dogwalkers as the program became more popular.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.congressionalcemetery.org/ |title=Dogwalking Program Overview}}</ref> The K-9 Corps program has been nationally recognized for creative use of urban green space.
