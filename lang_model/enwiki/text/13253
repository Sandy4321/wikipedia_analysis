'''Captain Wonder''' ('''Professor Jeff<ref>''The Twelve'' #1</ref> Jordan''') is a [[Fictional character|fictional]] [[comic book]] character, first published by [[Timely Comics]], the forerunner of [[Marvel Comics]] during the period known to fans and historians as the [[Golden Age of Comic Books]].  He is superhero who possesses the power of super strength. He first appeared in ''Kid Komics'' #1 in February [[1943 in comics|1943]].

==Comparison to Captain America==

Besides the obvious link of his name, Captain Wonder has other similarities to [[Captain America]], and may have been a rip-off of that character. There are some uniform similarities, they both fought against the Axis powers, and the origins are very similar.

==Fictional character biography==
Accounts differ on how exactly Captain Wonder got his powers, but the basic story is that Professor Jordan invented a miracle drug that gave the user the strength of twelve men.  A young man named [[Tim Mulrooney]] somehow ended up at his laboratory, where the Professor was to show him the drug.  However, there was an accident in which the vial containing the drug was dropped, causing Tim and Jordan to pass out, with Tim saving Jordan's life.  When they awoke, Jordan had superhuman strength, and Tim may or may not have had the same power.  Jordan decided to use his powers as a superhero, fighting crime and the Nazis.  He took Tim as his sidekick.

===The Twelve===
Captain Wonder is among the heroes who fought the Nazis at the end of World War II and while searching a base, was captured and put in suspended animation.

When they are awoken 60 years later, Captain Wonder is one of the two who discover that it is the 21st Century.  He also discovers that his wife died 20 years earlier and his two sons were killed in the [[Vietnam War]]<ref>''The Twelve'' #1</ref>.

==Powers and abilities==
Captain Wonder possessed "the strength of twelve men."  Judging by the [[Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe]], this works out to be the ability to lift about 960 lbs.  In ''The Twelve'' is also shows that he can fly, and may have limited invulnerability.
