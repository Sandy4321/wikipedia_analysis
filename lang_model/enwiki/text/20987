==History==
Drake is said to have taken the drum, emblazoned with his [[coat of arms]], with him on his voyages around the world between 1577 and 1580.<ref name=icons /> It was still with him for his final voyage and as he lay on his death bed off the coast of [[Panama]] in 1596 he ordered the drum returned to England where in times of trouble it should be beaten to recall him from heaven to rescue the country.<ref name=paranorm /> 

Following his death the drum was returned to Drake<U+2019>s family home of [[Buckland Abbey]] in [[Buckland Monachorum]], [[Devon]]. The drum remains on public display at Buckland Abbey under the care of the [[National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty|National Trust]].

The drum has become an icon of [[English folklore]] with its variation of the classic [[king in the mountain]] story. Several times throughout history, people have claimed to have heard the drum beating, including: when the [[Mayflower]] left Plymouth for America in 1620,<ref name=icons />, when [[Admiral Lord Nelson]] was made a freeman of Plymouth,<ref name=icons />, when [[Napoleon]] was brought into Plymouth Harbour as a prisoner,<ref name=icons /><ref name=paranorm /> and when [[World War I]] first began in 1914.<ref name=paranorm />

Reportedly, on [[HMS Royal Oak (08)|HMS ''Royal Oak'']], a victory drum roll from a drum was heard when the [[German navy]] surrendered in 1918. The ship was then searched twice by the officers and then again by the captain and neither a drum nor a drummer was found on board and eventually the phenomenon was put down to the legendary drum.<ref name=paranorm /><ref name=xroy /><ref name="xroy2">{{cite web |url = http://www.xroyvision.com.au/drake/history/drum2.html |title = Drake<U+2019>s Drum Heard in the German Surrender of 1918 |accessdate = April 14, 2008 |author = |last = |first = |authorlink = |coauthors = |date = |year = |month = |work = |publisher = xroyvision |pages = |doi = |archiveurl = |archivedate = |quote = }}</ref> 

In 1938, when Buckland Abbey was partly destroyed by fire, the drum was rescued and taken to safety at [[Buckfast Abbey]].<ref name=icons /><ref name=xroy /> Plymouth was devastated in the [[airstrike|air raids]] that followed, reminding some of the ancient legend that <U+201C>If Drake<U+2019>s Drum should be moved from its rightful home, the city will fall<U+201D>.<ref name="pplswar">{{cite web |url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/ww2peopleswar/stories/09/a3323909.shtml |title = Drake<U+2019>s Drum |accessdate = April 14, 2008 |author = Ursula Hill |last = |first = |authorlink = |coauthors = |date = |year = |month = |format = |work = |publisher = bbc.co.uk |pages = |doi = |archiveurl = |archivedate = |quote = }}</ref> The drum was returned and the city remained safe for the rest of the war.

The drum was most recently reported to be heard in 1940 at the [[Dunkirk evacuation]] during [[World War II]].<ref name=paranorm />In 1940 the 45th Infantry Division, which included 4th and 5th Battalions of The Duke of Cornwall's Light Infantry, and the 9th battalion The Devonshire Regiment took Drakes Drum as their emblem which was painted on their transport.
Drake<U+2019>s Drum has been the title and subject of poems by Sir [[Henry Newbolt]]<ref>Louis Untermeyer (ed). ''Modern British Poetry'', [[Bartleby.com]] ''[http://www.bartleby.com/103/41.html Drake<U+2019>s Drum]''</ref> and the Victorian poet Norah M. Holland.<ref>[http://digital.library.upenn.edu/women/holland/spindrift/drum.html Drake<U+2019>s Drum], the page on the website of [http://digital.library.upenn.edu/women/#A_Section The Celebration of Women Writers] cites as a reference [http://digital.library.upenn.edu/women/holland/spindrift/spindrift.html Spun-Yarn And Spindrift]. by Norah M. Holland. London & Toronto: J. M. Dent & Sons; New York: E. P. Dutton & Co., 1918, p. 88.</ref> Newbolt's poem was set to music by [[Charles Villiers Stanford]] as part of his Songs of the Sea, op.91 suite2. It was popularised by [[Peter Dawson (bass-baritone)|Peter Dawson]]. It is set in the key of D minor, with a dramatic resolution to D major.

The drum was also mentioned in [[Bernard Cornwell]]<U+2019>s [[1988 in literature|1988 novel]] ''[[Sharpe's Rifles (novel)|Sharpe<U+2019>s Rifles]]'' as analogous to the [[Gonfalon]] of [[Santiago Matamoros]] that features heavily in the story. A composition called "Drake's Drum" can also be heard on the album by British instrumental band [[Acoustic Alchemy]], ''[[Natural Elements (Acoustic Alchemy album)|Natural Elements]]'' (1988).
