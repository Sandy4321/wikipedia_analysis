'''Louie Broady Nunn''' (March 8, 1924 &ndash; January 29, 2004) was the [[List of Governors of Kentucky|52nd]] [[governor of Kentucky]]. Elected in 1967, he was the first [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] elected to that office since [[Simeon Willis]] in 1943 and the last to hold it until the election of [[Ernie Fletcher]] in 2003.

After rendering noncombat service in [[World War II]] and graduating from law school, Nunn entered local politics, becoming the first Republican [[county judge]] in the history of [[Barren County, Kentucky]]. He worked on the campaigns of Republican candidates for national office, including [[John Sherman Cooper]], [[Thruston Morton]], and [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]]. He was the Republican nominee for governor in 1963, but ultimately lost a close election to [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] [[Edward T. Breathitt|Ned Breathitt]]. An executive order signed by Governor [[Bert T. Combs]] that desegregated Kentucky's public services became a major issue in the campaign. Nunn vowed to repeal the order if elected, while Breathitt promised to continue it.

In 1967, Nunn again ran for governor. After defeating [[Marlow Cook]] in the Republican gubernatorial [[primary election|primary]], he eked out a victory over Democrat [[Henry Ward (Kentucky)|Henry Ward]]. The state offices were split between Democrats and Republicans, and Nunn was saddled with a Democratic [[Lieutenant Governor of Kentucky|lieutenant governor]], [[Wendell H. Ford]]. Despite a Democratic majority in the [[Kentucky General Assembly|General Assembly]], Nunn was able to enact most of his priorities including tax increases that funded improvements to the [[List of Kentucky state parks|state park system]] and the construction of a state-wide network of mental health centers. He oversaw the transition of [[Northern Kentucky University]] from a [[community college]] to a senior institution and brought the [[University of Louisville]] into the state university system. The later years of his administration were marred by [[Louisville riots of 1968|race riots in Louisville]] and a violent protest against the [[Vietnam War]] at the [[University of Kentucky]]. Following his term as governor, he unsuccessfully challenged [[Walter Huddleston|Walter "Dee" Huddleston]] in the [[United States Senate elections, 1972|1972 senatorial election]] and [[John Y. Brown, Jr.]] in the 1979 gubernatorial contest. In later life, he supported the political ambitions of his son, [[Steve Nunn|Steve]], and advocated for the legalization of [[industrial hemp]] in Kentucky. He died at home of a [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]] on January 29, 2004.

Western Kentucky University</ref><ref>Byrd, pp. 17&ndash;18</ref>

Nunn obtained the first eight years of his education in a one-room, one-teacher schoolhouse in Park.<ref name=powell108>Powell, p. 108</ref><ref name=byrd37>Byrd, p. 37</ref> During his teenage years, he gave himself a [[hernia]] while lifting a heavy piece of farm equipment.<ref name=byrd37/> This, combined with his father's health history, may have contributed to back pain issues that plagued him for most of his life.<ref>Byrd, pp. 17, 37</ref> In 1938, he matriculated to Hiseville High School.<ref name=byrd40>Byrd, p. 40</ref> He earned a [[Bachelor of Arts]] degree at Bowling Green Business University.<ref name=nga>"Kentucky Governor Louie Broady Nunn". National Governors Association</ref> 

Following the [[Attack on Pearl Harbor|bombing of Pearl Harbor]] on December 7, 1941, Nunn departed for [[Cincinnati, Ohio]] and began taking flying lessons, hoping to become a [[B-17 Flying Fortress|B-17]] pilot.<ref name=byrd42>Byrd, p. 42</ref> By the time he finished his flight training, however, the [[United States Army|Army]] had discontinued its air cadet program.<ref name=byrd42/> On June 2, 1943, he enlisted in the Army and received his [[recruit training]] at [[Fort Wolters]] near [[Fort Worth, Texas]].<ref name=byrd42/> He was transferred numerous times. First, he was stationed at [[Sheppard Air Force Base]] near [[Wichita Falls, Texas]].<ref name=byrd42/> Next, he was assigned to the [[97th Infantry Division (United States)|97th Infantry Division]], then received additional training at [[Fort Leonard Wood (military base)|Fort Leonard Wood]] in [[Missouri]].<ref name=byrd44>Byrd, p. 44</ref> Finally, he transferred to the [[Medical Corps (United States Army)|Army Medical Corps]], but his back injury flared up, and he received a medical discharge on September 13, 1945.<ref name=byrd44/> He held the rank of [[corporal]] at the time of his discharge.<ref name=sexton206>Sexton, p. 206</ref>

Following his military duty, Nunn pursued a pre-law degree at the [[University of Cincinnati]].<ref name=byrd44/> Three years later, he matriculated to the [[University of Louisville School of Law]] where he was a classmate of future congressman [[Marlow Cook]].<ref name=byrd46>Byrd, p. 46</ref> Nunn earned his [[Bachelor of Laws]] degree in 1950.<ref name=byrd45>Byrd, p. 45</ref><ref name=kye686>Harrison in ''The Kentucky Encyclopedia'', p. 686</ref> He opened his legal practice in [[Glasgow, Kentucky|Glasgow]] in September 1950.<ref name=byrd54>Byrd, p. 54</ref> 

On October 12, 1950, Nunn married Beula Cornelius Aspley, a divorcee from Bond, Kentucky.<ref name=powell108/><ref name=kye686/> The couple had two children &ndash; Jennie Lou, born in 1951 and [[Steve Nunn|Steve]], born in 1952.<ref name=byrd57>Byrd, p. 57</ref> Aspley also had three children from her first marriage.<ref name=byrd50>Byrd, p. 50</ref> Following Nunn's marriage, he left the [[Methodism|Methodist]] denomination in which he had been raised and joined the [[Christian Church (Disciples of Christ)|Christian Church]], of which his wife was a member.<ref name=nunn23>Nunn, p. 23</ref>

==Political career==
On June 17, 1953, Nunn declared as a Republican candidate for [[county judge]].<ref name=byrd68>Byrd, p. 68</ref> He was unopposed in the Republican [[primary election|primary]].<ref name=byrd68/> In the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] primary, one of the challengers charged that the incumbent had used his office for personal gain.<ref name=byrd69>Byrd, p. 69</ref> In the wake of the investigation, a group of disgruntled Democrats formed an organization to elect Nunn.<ref name=byrd69/> Nunn defeated his Democratic challenger by a vote of 5,171 to 4,378.<ref name=byrd69/> He was the first Republican ever elected county judge in the history of the heavily-Democratic county.<ref name=powell108/> 

In 1956, Nunn served as statewide campaign manager for [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]]'s presidential bid, as well as the [[United States Senate|senatorial]] campaigns of [[John Sherman Cooper]] and [[Thruston Morton]].<ref name=nga/> The Kentucky Junior Chamber of Commerce named him "Young Man of the Year" in 1956.<ref name=byrd77>Byrd, p. 77</ref> He was not a candidate for re-election as county judge in 1957, but was appointed as [[city attorney]] for the city of [[Glasgow, Kentucky|Glasgow]] in 1958.<ref name=powell108/> He considered running for governor in 1959, but became convinced it would be a bad year for Republicans and did not make the race.<ref name=byrd78>Byrd, p. 78</ref> He managed Senator Cooper's re-election campaign in 1960 and Senator Morton's in 1962.<ref name=nga/> He also managed the state campaign of presidential candidate [[Richard Nixon]] in 1960.<ref name=sexton207>Sexton, p. 207</ref>

Nunn was the Republican nominee for [[governor of Kentucky]] in 1963.<ref name=powell108/> During the campaign, he attacked an executive order issued by sitting Democratic governor [[Bert T. Combs]] that desegregated public accommodations in the state.<ref name=nhok411>Harrison in ''A New History of Kentucky'', p. 411</ref> Calling the order "a dictatorial edict of questionable constitutionality", Nunn charged that it had been dictated by [[United States Attorney General|U. S. Attorney General]] [[Robert Kennedy]].<ref name=pearce221>Pearce, p. 221</ref> In a television appearance, Nunn displayed a copy of the order and declared "My first act will be to abolish this."<ref name=nhok411/> ''[[The New Republic]]'' accused him of conducting "the first outright segregationist campaign in Kentucky".<ref name=nhok411/> He lost the election to Democrat [[Edward T. Breathitt|Ned Breathitt]] by a margin of just over 13,000 votes.<ref name=nhok411/> 

===Governor of Kentucky===
In 1967, Nunn faced his old classmate, [[Jefferson County, Kentucky|Jefferson County]] judge Marlow Cook, in Kentucky's first Republican gubernatorial [[primary election|primary]] in many years.<ref name=powell108/><ref name=kye686/> Nunn attacked Cook as a "[[Liberalism in the United States|liberal]], former [[New York]]er", and some of his supporters made reference to Cook's "[[Jew]]ish backers".<ref name=nhok413>Harrison in ''A New History of Kentucky'', p. 413</ref> The injection of [[antisemitism]] into the campaign drew criticism from Senator John Sherman Cooper, who threw his support to Cook.<ref name=nhok413/> Nunn also attacked Cook for his [[Catholicism|Catholic]] faith, a tactic that proved particularly effective with the state's rural and [[Protestantism|Protestant]] voters.<ref name=nhok413/> Nunn won the primary by a close vote.<ref name=nhok413/>

Nunn then faced Democrat [[Henry Ward (Kentucky)|Henry Ward]] in the general election.<ref name=powell108/> During the campaign, Nunn charged that Democrats wanted to raise taxes to pay for administrative inefficiencies.<ref name=kye686/> He also played up divisions within the Democratic party, and was endorsed by two-time former Democratic Governor [[Happy Chandler|A. B. "Happy" Chandler]].<ref name=kye686/><ref name=nhok413/> Nunn allied himself closely with the national Republican campaign against [[Lyndon B. Johnson]], bringing several prominent Republicans to the state to speak for him.<ref name=sexton207/> He won the election by a vote of 454,123 to 425,674 despite the fact that half of the other state offices went to Democrats, including the [[Lieutenant Governor of Kentucky|lieutenant governorship]], won by [[Wendell H. Ford]].<ref name=nhok414>Harrison in ''A New History of Kentucky'', p. 414</ref> 

The General Assembly was controlled by Democrats, but Nunn was able to pass most of his agenda.<ref name=kye686/> Despite a campaign promise not to raise taxes, when the outgoing Breathitt administration projected a shortfall of $24 million in the state budget, Nunn convinced the [[Kentucky General Assembly|General Assembly]] to pass an increase in the motor vehicle license fee from $5.00 to $12.50 and raise the state [[sales tax]] from three percent to five percent.<ref name=kye686/><ref name=sexton207/> Nunn's budget focused on increased funding for education, mental health, and economic development.<ref name=kye686/> In the 1970 legislative session, the General Assembly enacted Nunn's proposals to eliminate taxes on prescription drugs and the use fee charged on vehicles transferred within families, but rejected his plans to reduce the [[income tax]] for low-income families and increase tax credits for the blind and the elderly.<ref name=kye686/> 

Nunn oversaw the entry of the [[University of Louisville]] into the state's public university system.<ref name=nga/> Fulfilling a campaign promise, he helped transform Northern Kentucky Community College into Northern Kentucky State College (now [[Northern Kentucky University]]), a four-year institution and member of the state university system.<ref name=crowley>Crowley, "Nunn was promoter of NKU, friends recall"</ref> Historian [[Lowell H. Harrison]] opined that these actions diluted state support to existing higher education institutions.<ref name=kye686/> Nunn also supported the newly-created [[Kentucky Educational Television]].<ref name=kye686/>

Nunn doubled the accommodations in the [[List of Kentucky state parks|state park system]].<ref name=wku/> [[Barren River Lake State Resort Park]] was completed during his tenure, and three other parks were planned and funded during his administration.<ref name=wku/> He also greatly improved the state mental health system.<ref name=nyt/> Under his leadership, a state-wide network of 22 mental health centers was completed, and all four state psychiatric hospitals were accredited for the first time.<ref name=nyt/> Nunn called the revamping of the state mental health system his proudest accomplishment at governor.<ref name=nyt/> There was not total agreement between Nunn and the legislature however. The governor [[veto]]ed one-quarter of the bills passed in the 1968 legislative session and 14 percent of those passed in the 1970 session.<ref name=nhok414/> An [[fair housing|open housing]] bill became law without Nunn's signature, and he also refused to sign the 1970 state budget as a form of protest.<ref name=powell108/><ref name=nhok414/> (Unsigned bills become law after ten days under the [[Kentucky Constitution]], in contrast to the [[pocket veto]] provision in the [[United States Constitution|federal constitution]].)

A supporter of [[President of the United States|President]] Nixon's law-and-order philosophies, Nunn called out the [[United States National Guard|National Guard]] to break up violent protests in the state.<ref name=kye686/> In May 1968, he sent the Guard to [[Louisville, Kentucky|Louisville]] to break up [[Louisville riots of 1968|race-related protests]] that followed peaceful [[civil rights]] marches.<ref name=sexton208>Sexton, p. 208</ref> This action was criticized by civil rights leaders across the state.<ref name=sexton208/> In May 1970, Nunn again dispatched the Guard to quell protests against the [[Vietnam War]] at the [[University of Kentucky]] including the imposition of a [[curfew]] that interfered with [[final examination]]s.<ref name=nhok414/> The latter protest culminated in the burning of one of the university's [[Reserve Officers Training Corps|ROTC]] buildings.<ref name=kye686/> 

From 1968 to 1969, Nunn served on the Executive Committee of the [[National Governors Association|National Governors' Conference]], and in 1971, he chaired the [[Republican Governors Association]].<ref name=nga/> The ''[[Louisville Courier-Journal]]'' said of Nunn's administration "On the whole, his management of the state's finances has been sound. ... [H]e took a general fund facing a deficit, restored it to solvency, and kept it healthy. No scandals have marred the Nunn record. He chose able men to direct his revenue and finance departments, and their efficiency saved the state millions of dollars."<ref>Sexton, pp. 208&ndash;209</ref> Historian [[Thomas D. Clark]] called Nunn the strongest of Kentucky's eight Republican governors.<ref name=sexton210/>

==Later career==
Following his term as governor, Nunn opened a law practice in [[Lexington, Kentucky|Lexington]].<ref name=kye686/> He campaigned for a seat in the U.S. Senate in 1972, losing to Democrat [[Walter Huddleston|Walter "Dee" Huddleston]].<ref name=powell108/> His loss came despite a landslide victory for Richard Nixon in the state and was generally blamed on his support for an increased sales tax during his gubernatorial administration.<ref name=sexton209>Sexton, p. 209</ref> He continued backing Republican candidates, including his support of [[Ronald Reagan]] in 1975.<ref name=sexton209/> His last run for office came in 1979 when he was again the Republican nominee for governor against Democrat [[John Y. Brown, Jr.]].<ref name=sexton209/> He decried the excessive spending, expanding government, and increased state employment that had occurred under Democratic administrations.<ref name=sexton209/> He also attacked Brown for his playboy image (he was married to former [[Miss America]] [[Phyllis George]]) and his refusal to release his tax returns, as well as his inexperience in government.<ref name=sexton209/> Despite these attacks, Nunn lost by a vote of 558,008 to 381,278 and returned to his legal practice.<ref name=sexton209/> 

In the 1980s, Nunn served on the boards of regents of [[Morehead State University]] and [[Kentucky State University]].<ref name=kye686/> He served as a distinguished lecturer at [[Western Kentucky University]] and received the Distinguished Alumni Award from the University of Louisville in 1999.<ref name=wku/> He disapproved of the emerging Republican leadership in Kentucky, criticizing Senator [[Mitch McConnell]] for not doing more to support other Republicans in their bids for office.<ref name=sexton210/> He unsuccessfully challenged [[United States House of Representatives|Congressman]] [[Jim Bunning]] in his bid to retain his position as Kentucky's Republican national committeeman in 1988.<ref name=sexton209/> 

In 1994, Nunn's wife Beulah filed for [[divorce]] from a hospital bed where she lay dying of [[cancer]].<ref name=samples/><ref name=estep>Estep, "Louie Nunn accused son Steve of abusing him"</ref> She claimed she was trying to preserve some of her estate for her children.<ref name=samples/> A Metcalfe County judge granted the divorce, but Nunn challenged the ruling, and it was later set aside.<ref name=estep/> Some property issues were still pending at the time of Beulah's death in 1995.<ref name=estep/> During the divorce proceedings, Nunn's son Steve sided with his mother, causing a rift between Steve Nunn and his father.<ref name=estep/> A 1994 letter from the elder Nunn alleged that Steve Nunn physically and verbally abused Louie Nunn and other members of his family.<ref name=estep/> The letter was discovered in 2009 when Steve Nunn was charged with the murder of his former fianc<U+00E9>e, Amanda Ross.<ref name=estep/>

In 1999, Nunn again considered a bid for governor, precluding a potential bid by his son, Steve.<ref name=sexton210>Sexton, p. 210</ref> He cited personal and health issues for not making the race. In 2000, he backed the presidential campaign of Senator [[John McCain]].<ref name=sexton210/> Nunn was reconciled to his son Steve, and when Steve ran for governor in in 2003, Louie supported him.<ref name=sexton210 /> Steve Nunn ultimately ran third in a four-way primary.<ref name=sexton210/> The elder Nunn then supported Republican nominee Ernie Fletcher, hosting a fundraiser for him.<ref name=sexton210/> 

Nunn also became an advocate of legalizing [[industrial hemp]] in Kentucky.<ref name=samples>Samples, "Bluegrass hemp fight has an ally"</ref> Of the issue, Nunn wrote "Frankly, I was opposed to the legalization of hemp for years because I had been of the opinion hemp was [[marijuana]]. I was short-sighted in my thinking, and I was wrong."<ref name=samples/> In 2000, Nunn defended actor [[Woody Harrelson]], who came to [[Lee County, Kentucky]] and planted hemp seeds in open defiance of Kentucky's law forbidding cultivation of hemp.<ref name=samples/> Harrelson was acquitted.<ref name=samples/> Later, he traveled to [[South Dakota]] where, at the base of [[Mount Rushmore]], he publicly presented a [[Oglala Lakota]] leader with bales of hemp after the tribe's crop was confiscated by officers from the federal [[Drug Enforcement Administration]].<ref name=samples/>

Louie B. Nunn died of a [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]] at his home in [[Versailles, Kentucky]] on January 29, 2004, hours after hosting a luncheon with labor leaders seeking help in dealing with the newly-elected Fletcher administration.<ref name=nyt>"Louie Nunn, Former Governor Of Kentucky, Is Dead at 79". ''The New York Times''</ref><ref name=sexton210/> He was buried at the Cosby Methodist Church cemetery in [[Hart County, Kentucky]].<ref name=wolfe>Wolfe, p. A6</ref> The Cumberland Parkway was renamed the [[Louie B. Nunn Cumberland Parkway]] in 2000.<ref name=parkway>"Man Held in Shooting of 2 in Ginseng Patch". ''Lexington Herald-Leader''</ref> The main lodge at the Barren River Lake State Resort Park is also named in Nunn's honor.<ref name=bailey>Bailey, p. D1</ref>
