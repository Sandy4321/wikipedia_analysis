The college has specialist status in Maths and Computing.<ref name="devon2">{{cite web|url=http://www.devon.gov.uk/devel/index/learningschools/schools/admissions/when-apply-school-place/transfertosecondaryeducation/nextstep10/nxt10-exmouth.htm |title=Exmouth Community College, Exmouth |publisher=Devon.gov.uk |date=2009-08-13 |accessdate=2012-07-26}}</ref> and is equipped with 900 workstations many of which are in one of the 12 IT suites. 

The school has two sites, one on Gipsy Lane<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.exmouthcollege.devon.sch.uk/site%20map%20gipsy%20lane.html |title=Exmouth College Site map Gipsy Lane |publisher=Exmouthcollege.devon.sch.uk |date= |accessdate=2012-07-26}}</ref> and the other on Green Close,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.exmouthcollege.devon.sch.uk/site%20map%20green%20close.html |title=Exmouth College Site Map Green Close |publisher=Exmouthcollege.devon.sch.uk |date= |accessdate=2012-07-26}}</ref> connected by a bridge. The Green Close site is primarily for the 'lower school' (years 7 to 9) while the Gipsy Lane site caters for the 'upper school' (years 10 to 11) and sixth form (post-16). Both sites have undergone rapid development, with the Turner Building (1997) and Pauline Hitchings Building (2005) opening on the Green Close site and Judith Telfer Centre on the Gipsy Lane site (1997). 

Following a government initiative in 2010, the college made the transition from a comprehensive school under LEA control to academy status, therefore having greater control over their own funding. 

== Subjects offered ==
The most recent [[Ofsted]] inspection graded the college curriculum as "outstanding", and the college as a whole as "good".<ref name="ofsted.gov.uk">{{cite web|url=http://www.ofsted.gov.uk/oxedu_reports/display/(id)/70764 |title=Find an inspection report |publisher=Ofsted |date= |accessdate=2012-07-26}}</ref> The PE department of the college is also graded "outstanding" by Ofsted.

As well as offering the core curriculum with a choice between academic and vocational subjects, the college also offers an alternative curriculum, focusing entirely on workplace skills. The options available at [[Key Stage 4]] are extensive.

==Specialist status==
The school has specialist status in Maths and ICT.<ref name="devon2"/> The funding that has accompanied this status has ensured that classrooms are well equipped and that the number of IT suites for whole college and departmental use has expanded greatly.
