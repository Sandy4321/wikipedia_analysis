The '''12th Boat Race''' took place on the [[River Thames]] on 8 April 1854.

The race was won by Oxford who triumphed over Cambridge by seven lengths.

[[The Boat Race]] is a [[Rowing (sport)#Side by side|side-by-side rowing]] competition between the [[University of Oxford]] (sometimes referred to as the "Dark Blues")<ref name=blues>{{Cite web | url = http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2003/apr/06/theobserver | work = [[The Observer]] | title = Dark Blues aim to punch above their weight | date = 6 April 2003 | accessdate = 1 September 2014 }}</ref> and the [[University of Cambridge]] (sometimes referred to as the "Light Blues").<ref name=blues/>  The race was first held in 1829, and since 1845 has taken place on the {{convert|4.2|mi|km|adj=on}} [[The Championship Course|Championship Course]] on the [[River Thames]] in southwest London.<ref>{{Cite web | url = http://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/destinations/europe/uk/london/10719622/University-Boat-Race-2014-spectators-guide.html | work = [[The Daily Telegraph]] | accessdate = 3 June 2014 | date = 25 March 2014 |title = University Boat Race 2014: spectators' guide | first = Oliver |last =Smith}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web | url = http://theboatraces.org/the-course | title = The Course| accessdate = 7 November 2014 | publisher = The Boat Race Company Limited}}</ref>  Oxford went into the race as reigning champions, having defeated Cambridge by nine lengths in the [[The Boat Race 1852|previous race]].

There was no Boat Race in 1853 as the [[Henley Royal Regatta]] was scheduled for the same time as that proposed by Cambridge in their challenge to Oxford.  The universities did however race each other that year, in the [[Grand Challenge Cup]], which was won by Oxford.<ref>MacMichael, pp. 197&ndash;202</ref>  On 11 February 1854, a challenge was sent to Oxford by the former Light Blue [[Coxswain|cox]] [[Thomas Selby Egan]], who had assumed temporary captaincy of [[Cambridge University Boat Club]], despite having coached the Dark Blues to victory in the 1852 race.<ref>MacMichael, p. 204</ref><ref>{{Cite book | title = Rowing in England: A Social History : the Amateur Debate | first = Eric |last = Halladay | url = http://books.google.it/books?id=9Ee8AAAAIAAJ&pg=PA46&dq=%22Egan%22+Oxford+coach&hl=en&sa=X&ei=_c9cVPKpLoevPILMgKAL&ved=0CDAQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=%22Egan%22%20Oxford%20coach&f=false | pages = 45&ndash;46 | publisher = [[Manchester University Press]] | date = 18 October 1990 | isbn = 978-0719026058}}</ref>

Although Oxford arrived at Putney as favourites to win the race, Cambridge's style was enough to force the odds to evens.  However, in a practice race, the Dark Blues defeated a [[Waterman (occupation)|watermen]] scratch crew easily and restored their position as pre-race favourites.<ref name=drink40>Drinkwater, p. 40</ref> Both crews rowed in {{convert|65|ft|m|adj=on}} long boats manufactured by Searle.<ref>MacMichael, p. 214</ref>  The umpire for the race was [[Charles Jasper Selwyn]] and the starter was Edward Searle.<ref>Burnell p. 49</ref>

==Crews==
The Oxford crew weighed an average of 11&nbsp;[[Stone (unit)|st]] 1&nbsp;[[Pound (mass)|lb]] (70.1&nbsp;kg), {{convert|5.75|lb|kg|1}} per rower more than their opponents.<ref name=mac211/>  Cambridge saw one rower return from the 1852 race in F. Johnson, while Oxford's crew contained two former [[Blue (university sport)|Blues]] in Nind and the [[Oxford University Boat Club]] president Olliver Meade King.<ref name=mac211/>

Oxford were pre-race favourites.<ref>MacMichael, p. 209</ref>  They won the toss and elected to start from the Middlesex station, handing Cambridge the Surrey side of the river.<ref name=mac211/>  The race commenced at 10.40am,<ref name=drink40/> with Oxford pulling away from the start.  The Dark Blues were clear of Cambridge by the time the crews reached the Crab Tree.  By [[Hammersmith Bridge]] both coxes were forced to take evasive action as a result of a barge blocking their route.<ref>MacMichael, p. 212</ref>  With a lead of two lengths after the bridge, Oxford continued to increase their lead, eventually passing the flag-boat with a seven-length advantage in a time of 25 minutes 29 seconds.  It was their third consecutive victory and took the overall record to 7&ndash;5 in Cambridge's favour.<ref name=results>{{Cite web | url = http://theboatraces.org/results| publisher= The Boat Race Company Limited | title = Boat Race <U+2013> Results| accessdate = 7 November 2014}}</ref>  

In a speech in the evening's celebrations, Charles Selwyn, who had umpired this and the previous four Boat Races, declared that he was "no longer young and active enough" to continue to act in the capacity of umpire;<ref name=mac213/> he would be replaced in 1856 by W. G. Rich,<ref>Burnell p. 49</ref> the former [[Cambridge University Boat Club]] president who had rowed in both the [[The Boat Race 1849 (March)|March]] and [[The Boat Race 1849 (December)|December races]] of 1849.<ref>MacMichael, pp. 150, 160</ref>
