'''Ren<U+00E9>e Ador<U+00E9>e''' (September 30, 1898 <U+2013> October 5, 1933) was a French actress who appeared in Hollywood [[silent movie]]s during the 1920s.

==Early life==
Born '''Jeanne de la Fonte'''<ref>''Le Vrai Nom des stars'' de [[Michel Bracquart]] - M.A. Editions - 1989 - (ISBN 2866764633)</ref> in [[Lille]], she was the daughter of circus artists and by age five was performing with her parents. In her teens, she began acting in minor stage productions and toured Europe with her troupe. She was performing in Russia when [[World War I]] broke out and fled to London.<ref name="Find a Grave">{{cite web|url=http://www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=gr&GRid=2054|author=Carrie-Anne|title=Ren<U+00E9>e Ador<U+00E9>e|work=Find a Grave|accessdate=2010-08-26}}</ref> 

==Career==
From London she went to New York City, where she continued to work in the theatre until the opportunity arose to work in the motion picture business.<ref name="Find a Grave"/> 

In 1920, given the exotic name Ren<U+00E9>e Ador<U+00E9>e (French for "reborn" and "adored," both in the feminine form) by the studio, she appeared in her first motion picture. While in New York City on New Year's Eve 1921 she met [[Thomas J. Moore|Tom Moore]] (1883&ndash;1955). Fifteen years her senior, Tom Moore and his brothers were very successful Hollywood actors. Six weeks after their meeting, on February 12, 1921, Ador<U+00E9>e married Moore at his home in [[Beverly Hills, California]]. The marriage did not last, and in 1925, Ador<U+00E9>e married again, this time to Sherman Gill.{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}}

She is most famous for her role as Melisande in the melodramatic romance and war epic ''[[The Big Parade]]'' (1925) opposite [[John Gilbert (actor)|John Gilbert]]. It became one of [[MGM|MGM's]] all-time biggest hits and a film that historians rank as one of the best of the [[silent film]] era. In ''[[The Mating Call (film)|The Mating Call]]'' a 1928 film produced by [[Howard Hughes]], Ador<U+00E9>e had a very brief [[nude swimming]] scene that caused a significant commotion at the time. {{Citation needed|date=November 2011}}

With the advent of sound in film, Ador<U+00E9>e was one of the fortunate actors whose voices met the film industry's new needs. She would star opposite [[Lon Chaney, Sr.|Lon Chaney]] and her former brother-in-law [[Owen Moore]], make three more films with John Gilbert, and appear in four films with another leading Hollywood actor [[Ramon Novarro]].

==Illness and death==
By the end of 1930, Ador<U+00E9>e had appeared in forty-five films, the last four of them talkies. That year she was diagnosed with [[tuberculosis]] and lived only a few years longer. Ador<U+00E9>e went against her physician's advice by finishing her final film, ''[[Call of the Flesh]]'' with [[Ramon Novarro]]. At its completion, she was rushed to a [[sanatorium|sanitarium]] in [[Prescott, Arizona]], where she lay flat on her back for two years in an effort to regain her physical health. In April 1933, she left the sanitarium. At this point, it was thought she had recovered sufficiently to resume her screen career, but she swiftly weakened and her health declined day by day. She was moved from her modest home in the Tujunga Hills to the [[Sunland, Los Angeles, California|Sunland]] health resort in September 1933.<ref>[[New York Times]], ''Renee Adoree, 31, Film Player, Dead'', October 6, 1933, p. 17.</ref>

Ador<U+00E9>e died there, a few days after her 35th birthday, on October 5, 1933 in [[Tujunga, California]]. She is interred in the [[Hollywood Forever Cemetery]], [[Hollywood, California]].

Ador<U+00E9>e left an estate valued at $2,429. The only heir was her mother, who lived in England. No will was found.<ref>New York Times, ''Renee Adoree Left No Will'', October 11, 1933, p. 26.</ref>

For contributions to the motion picture industry, Ador<U+00E9>e was honored with a star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]] at 1611 [[Hollywood Boulevard]].<ref name="HWOFDB">{{cite web|url=http://www.hwof.com/stars?recipient=Renee_Adoree |title=Hollywood Walk of Fame database |publisher=HWOF.com}}</ref>
