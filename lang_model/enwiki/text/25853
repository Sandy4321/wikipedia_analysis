===New York Giants===
During the 2005 NFL draft, Tuck was selected with the 10th pick of the 3rd round by the New York Giants.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.giants.com/team/player132.html|title=Justin Tuck Giants career|author=|publisher=http://Giants.com|accessdate=2008-01-18|date=2008-01-18}}</ref> His rookie season in the NFL found him behind Pro Bowl defensive ends [[Michael Strahan]] and [[Osi Umenyiora]] on the New York Giants depth chart, reducing his role to special teams and the first backup at each defensive end position. He ended the 2005 season with 31 tackles, one sack, one forced fumble and one pass defended. His first career sack came against the Giants rival, The Dallas Cowboys. He also blocked a kick his rookie season.

During his sophomore season in 2006, Tuck was limited to just six games due to injury and only recorded 10 tackles on the season.

His best season so far was 2007 when he recorded 65 tackles, 10 sacks, and forced 2 fumbles.

Justin Tuck signed an extension with the New York Giants on [[January 17]], [[2008]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blog.nj.com/ledgergiants/2008/01/new_york_giants_justin_tuck_ag.html|title=Giants, Tuck agree on five-year extension|author=Mike Garafolo|publisher=Star Ledger|accessdate=2008-01-17|date=2008-01-18}}</ref>It was reported to be a 5 year deal worth an estimated 30 million dollars.  The contract includes 16 million dollars in guaranteed money.  Obviously the Giants see Tuck as the heir apparent to Michael Strahan.  Tuck now makes more money than both Pro Bowler DE Michael Strahan and Pro Bowler DE Osi Umenyiora.
