He was born in [[Paris]], [[France]] and was [[homeschooling|home-schooled]] to the age of 12. Later, Gennes studied at the ''[[<U+00C9>cole Normale Sup<U+00E9>rieure]]''. After leaving the ''<U+00C9>cole'' in [[1955]], he became a research engineer at the [[CEA/Saclay|Saclay center]] of the ''[[Commissariat <U+00E0> l'<U+00C9>nergie Atomique]]'', working mainly on neutron scattering and magnetism, with advice from A. Abragam and J. Friedel. He defended his [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] in [[1957]].

In [[1959]], he was a [[postdoctoral]] visitor with C. Kittel at the [[University of California, Berkeley]], and then spent 27 months in the [[French Navy]]. In [[1961]], he was assistant [[professor]] in [[Orsay University|Orsay]] and soon started the Orsay group on [[superconductors]]. In [[1968]], he switched to studying [[liquid crystal]]s.

In [[1971]], he became professor at the ''[[Coll<U+00E8>ge de France]]'', and participated to STRASCOL (a joint action of [[Strasbourg]], Saclay and ''Coll<U+00E8>ge de France'') on polymer physics. From [[1980]] on, he became interested in interfacial problems : the dynamics of [[wetting]] and [[adhesion]].

He was awarded the [[Lorentz Medal]] and [[Wolf Prize]] in 1990. In [[1991]], he received the [[Nobel Prize in physics]]. He was then director of the ''[[<U+00C9>cole Sup<U+00E9>rieure de Physique et de Chimie Industrielles de la Ville de Paris]]'' (ESPCI), a post he held from 1976 until his retirement in 2002.

P.G. de Gennes has also received the Holweck Prize from the joint French and British Physical Society; the Ampere Prize, French Academy of Science; the gold medal from the French CNRS; the Matteuci Medal, Italian Academy; the Harvey Prize, Israel; and polymer awards from both APS and ACS.

His Nobel Prize was awarded for "discovering that methods developed for studying order phenomena in simple systems can be generalized to more complex forms of matter, in particular to liquid crystals and polymer".

More recently, he worked on [[granular material]]s and on the nature of [[memory]] objects in the brain.
