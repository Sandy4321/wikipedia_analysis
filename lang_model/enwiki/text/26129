The '''General Jewish Labour Bund in Poland''' ({{lang-pl|Og<U+00F3>lny <U+017B>ydowski Zwi<U+0105>zek Robotniczy}}, {{lang-yi|Algemeyner Yidisher Arbeter Bund}}) was a [[History of the Jews in Poland|Jewish]] [[socialist]] party in [[Poland]], adhering to the political line of the [[General Jewish Labour Bund]].

==Creation and splinter groups==
In December 1917, a separate Central Committee was formed in Poland. In April 1920 the first convention of the Polish Bund was held, during which the merger of the [[Galicia (eastern Europe)|Galician]] [[Jewish Social Democratic Party]] into the Bund was materialized. At the conference a dispute over whether the party should join the [[Communist International]] erupted. A majority resolution calling for the entry of the party into the Communist International was passed at the convention, but never implemented. As a result the Polish Bund was divided, with around a quarter of the Polish Bund leaving the party to form a separate [[Communist Bund (Poland)|Communist Bund]] in 1921.<ref name="yivo">''[http://books.google.com/books?id=5DuagGR8RNsC Guide to the YIVO Archives, Volym 0]''. p. 43</ref><ref name="bund1">Universi<U+1E6D>ah ha-<U+02BB>Ivrit bi-Yerushalayim, and Makhon le-Yahadut zemanenu <U+02BB>a. sh.

==Electoral participation==
Contrarily to the other Jewish parties, the Bund advocated an electoral cooperation with other Socialists, and not just between either Jewish parties or with other minority parties. Thence, [[Agudat Israel]], [[Folkspartei]] and the various Zionist parties were represented in the [[Sejm]], but the Bund never was, mostly because its potential partner, the [[Polish Socialist Party]] (PPS), was reluctant to appear as a pro-Jewish party.<ref name=Johnpoll>Bernard K. Johnpoll, The politics of futility. The General Jewish Workers Bund of Poland, 1917-1943, Ithaca, New York, Cornell University Press, 1967</ref>

In the autumn of 1933 the party issued a call initiated to the Polish public to boycott of goods from [[Germany]], in protest of the [[Hitler]] regime.<ref name="press">Lakeberg, Beata.

In December 1938 and January 1939, at the last Polish municipal elections before the start of the [[Second World War]], the Bund received the largest segment of the Jewish vote.  In [[Warsaw]], the Bund won 61.7% of the votes cast for Jewish parties, taking 17 of the 20 municipal council seats won by Jewish parties.  In [[<U+0141><U+00F3>d<U+017A>]] the Bund won 57.4% (11 of 17 seats won by Jewish parties).<ref name=Polonsky>{{citation|last=Polonsky|first=Antony|editor-last=Mendelsohn|editor-first=Ezra|title=Essential Papers on Jews and the Left|year=1997|publisher=New York Univeristy Press|location=New York|pages=194-5|chapter=The Bund in Polish Political Life, 1935-1939|isbn=0814755704}}</ref> For the first time, the Bund and the PPS had agreed to call their electors to vote for each other where only one of them presented a list. This however did not go so far as common electoral lists. This alliance made it possible for a Left electoral victory in most great cities: Warsaw, <U+0141><U+00F3>d<U+017A>, [[Lviv|Lvov]], [[Piotrk<U+00F3>w Trybunalski|Piotrkow]], [[Krak<U+00F3>w]], [[Bia<U+0142>ystok]], [[Hrodna|Grodno]], [[Vilnius]].<ref name=Johnpoll/>

After its municipal electoral successes in December 1938 and January 1939, the Bund hoped for a breakthrough at the parliamentary elections due in September 1939, but these were de facto cancelled by the German-Soviet invasion.<ref name=Johnpoll/>

==Organization==
The party organization was based on local and regional groups, which formed the lowest level of party cells. Each group had its local party committee. The highest authority of the Bund resided with the Party Congress, which elected the Central Committee and the Party Council, an advisory group. The Central Committee was composed of delegates designated by the larger local parties.

In 1929 the organization of the party was changed. The Party Council was replaced by the Head Council, which was still organized by the Party Congress, but now the members of Council were selected from the members of the Central Committee.

During the interwar period in Poland, the organization had from 7,000 to 20,000 (on the eve of World War II) dues paying members.<ref name=Gorni>Yosef Gorni, "Converging alternatives: the Bund and the Zionist Labor Movement, 1897-1985", SUNY Press, 2006, pg. 4, [http://books.google.com/books?id=sUBSinsiciQC&pg=PA4&dq=The+Bund+elections+of+1947&as_brr=3#v=onepage&q=The%20Bund%20elections%20of%201947&f=false]</ref>

==Position towards emigration==
In Poland, the activists argued that Jews should stay and fight for socialism rather than emigrate. [[Marek Edelman]] once said "The Bundists did not wait for the Messiah, nor did they plan to leave for Palestine. They believed that Poland was their country and they fought for a just, socialist Poland, in which each nationality would have its own cultural autonomy, and in which minorities' rights would be guaranteed."<ref name="Warsaw Ghetto uprising leader Marek Edelman dies at 90">{{cite web|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/poland/6256830/Warsaw-Ghetto-uprising-leader-Marek-Edelman-dies-at-90.html|title=Warsaw Ghetto uprising leader Marek Edelman dies at 90|date=2009-10-03|accessdate=2009-10-04|publisher=''[[The Daily Telegraph]]''}}</ref>. When the [[Revisionist Zionism|Revisionist Zionist]] leader [[Vladimir Jabotinsky]] toured Poland urging the "evacuation" of European Jewry, the Bundists accused him of abetting anti-Semitism. Another non-Zionist Yiddishist Jewish party at the time in Lithuania and Poland was the [[Folkspartei]].

==World War II==
On August 26, 1939, the party signed the joint statement of socialist parties in Poland, calling for the people to fight against Hitlerism (other signatories included the [[German Socialist Labour Party of Poland]]).<ref>Marcus, Joseph.

After the 1939 German-Soviet invasion, the Bund continued to operate as an underground antinazi organization in German-occupied Poland. Several Bund leaders and structures stayed in Soviet-occupied Poland and endured the Stalinist repression. Two most eminent Bund leaders, [[Wiktor Alter]] and [[Henryk Erlich]] were executed in December 1941 in Moscow on Staline's orders under accusations of being agents of Nazi Germany.

In 1942, the Bundist [[Marek Edelman]] became a cofounder of the [[Jewish Fighting Organization]] that led the 1943 [[Warsaw Ghetto Uprising]], and was also part of the Polish [[resistance movement]] [[Armia Krajowa]] (Home Army), which fought against the [[Nazism|Nazis]] in the 1944 [[Warsaw Uprising]]. 

From March 1942, [[Szmul Zygielbojm|Samuel Zygelbojm]], a member of the Bund Central Committee since 1924,<ref>R. Henes, [http://www.jewishgen.org/Yizkor/chelm/che265.html#Page287 Shmuel Mordekhai (Arthur) Zigelboim], ''Commemoration Book Chelm'' (Translation of ''Yisker-bukh Chelm'', published in Yiddish in Johannesburg, 1954), pp. 287-294.</ref> was the Bund's representative on the National Council of the Polish government in exile in London. He committed suicide on May 12, 1943 to protest the indifference of the Allied governments in the face of the [[The Holocaust|Shoah]].<ref>Melvyn Conroy, [http://www.jewishgen.org/Yizkor/terrible_choice/ter006.html#Zygielbojm Szmul Mordekhai "Artur" Zygielbojm], ''The Terrible Choice: Some Contemporary Jewish Responses to the Holocaust.''</ref>

==Post-World War II==
The Bund took part in the [[Polish legislative election, 1947|Polish elections of 1947]] on a common ticket with the [[Polish Socialist Party]] (PPS) and gained its first and only parliamentary seat,{{Who|date=October 2009}} plus several seats in municipal councils. However, the Bund was dissolved, along with all other non-communist parties, in 1948 following the consolidation of single-party rule by the [[Polish United Workers' Party]].<ref name="yivo"/> In 1976, [[Marek Edelman]], a former Bundist activist and leader during the [[Warsaw Ghetto Uprising]], became part of the [[Komitet Obrony Robotnik<U+00F3>w|Workers' Defense Committee]]<ref name=Rzepa>"Rz" Online, "[http://www.rp.pl/artykul/375276_Pozegnanie_Marka_Edelmana.html Po<U+017C>egnanie Marka Edelmana]" (Farewell to Marek Edelman), ''[[Rzeczpospolita]]'', 09-10-2009</ref> and later part of the of the [[Solidarity]] trade union movement.<ref name=cbs>[http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2009/10/02/ap/europe/main5359835.shtml "Warsaw Ghetto Uprising Leader Edelman Dies At 90"]</ref> During the period of [[martial law in Poland|martial law]] in 1981, he was interned.<ref name=cbs/> He took part in the [[Polish Round Table Agreement|Round Table Talks]] and served as a member of [[Sejm|parliament]] from 1989 until 1993.
