The '''1986 Chalfant Valley earthquake''' struck southern [[Mono County]] near [[Bishop, California|Bishop]] and [[Chalfant, California|Chalfant]], [[California]] at {{Tooltip|07:42:26|14:42:26 UTC}} [[Pacific Time Zone|Pacific Daylight Time]] on July 21. With a [[Richter magnitude scale|Richter magnitude]] of 6.4 and a maximum [[Mercalli intensity scale|Mercalli Intensity]] of VI (''Strong''), the shock injured two people and caused property damage estimated at $2.7 million in the affected areas. There was a significant foreshock and aftershock sequence that included a few moderate events, and was the last in a series of three earthquakes that affected southern California and the northern [[Owens Valley]] in July 1986. 

[[Strong ground motion|Strong motion]] stations at the [[Long Valley Dam]] and an instrumented building in Bishop captured light to moderate readings from the event. The faulting reached the surface of the ground, but the maximum amount of measurable slip was limited to about {{convert|11|cm|sp=us}} of strike-slip motion along the White Mountain Fault Zone. Other destructive and surface-rupturing earthquakes, as well as large volume volcanic eruptions, have occurred in the area. Although the series of shocks occurred within the White Mountain [[seismic gap]], the region continues to have potential for a very large earthquake.

==Preface==
July 1986 was an unusually active month for moderate to strong earthquakes in California, with three events occurring in less than two weeks, each with mild to moderate effects. The first of these shocks came on July 8 with a M6.0 event on the Banning fault near [[Palm Springs, California|Palm Springs]] and the second event occurred off the coast of [[Oceanside, California|Oceanside]] as a M5.8 shock on July 13. While the earthquake off the [[South Coast (California)|southern California coast]] occurred in an area thought to be capable of generating a [[tsunami]], the earthquake near Palm Springs occurred on a portion of the southern [[San Andreas Fault]] system that has been designated a [[seismic gap]], and is a likely location for a very large earthquake. The same seismic gap theory (regarding the potential for a future large earthquake) had also been presented for the [[White Mountains (California)|White Mountains]] area near Chalfant.<ref>{{citation|title=Source mechanisms of three moderate California earthquakes of July 1986|url=http://bssa.geoscienceworld.org/content/78/6/1907.abstract|first=J.|last=Pacheco|first2=J.|last2=Nabelek|year=1988|journal=Bulletin of the Seismological Society of America|publisher=[[Seismological Society of America]]|volume=78|number=6|pages=1907<U+2013>1909}}</ref>

==Tectonic setting==
[[File:Wpdms shdrlfi020l owens valley.jpg|thumb|left|The Owens Valley region]]
{{see also|Large volume volcanic eruptions in the Basin and Range Province}}

The [[Owens Valley]], located at the western boundary of the [[Basin and Range Province]], is confined by the [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada]] mountain range to the west and the White-[[Inyo Mountains]] to the east. The valley was brought about by active [[tectonics]] over the last 2<U+2013>4 million years, and was the scene of a very large earthquake in 1872 that generated surface rupture from [[Lone Pine, California|Lone Pine]] in the south to as far north as [[Big Pine, California|Big Pine]], a distance of approximately {{convert|100|km|sp=us}}. Other large, surface rupturing events in [[1915 Pleasant Valley earthquake|1915]], 1932, and 1954 delineate the [[Walker Lane|Eastern California<U+2013>Central Nevada seismic zone]].<ref name=Pinter>{{citation|title=Faulting on the Volcanic Tableland, Owens Valley, California|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/30071137|first=N.|last=Pinter|year=1995|journal=The Journal of Geology|publisher=[[University of Chicago Press]]|volume=103|number=1|pages=73<U+2013>76|doi=10.1086/629723}}</ref>

As no large earthquake has occurred between the southern extent of the 1932 [[Cedar Mountains (Nevada)|Cedar Mountain]] earthquake's rupture and the northern extent of the [[1872 Lone Pine earthquake]]'s rupture in the south (a distance of {{convert|130|km|abbr=on}}), the zone has been labeled the White Mountain seismic gap. The 1934 M6.3 Excelsior Mountains earthquake and the 1986 Chalfant Valley event were several smaller earthquakes that have occurred within the gap, and both generated limited surface faulting and some surface cracking in the Volcanic Tableland, which was created .7 [[myr|mya]] from a major volcanic eruption that also formed the [[Long Valley Caldera]] northwest of Bishop. An estimated 500 cubic kilometers of material ([[tephra]]) produced in the event covers the northern Owens Valley as a rocky landform. The surface of the layered plateau is known as [[Bishop Tuff]] and features [[fumarole]] mounds and hundreds of north-south oriented fault scarps, many of which are visible on topographic maps, via aerial photography, and [[satellite imagery]].<ref name=Pinter/>

==Foreshocks==
The [[University of Nevada, Reno]] (UNR) and the [[United States Geological Survey]] (USGS) both operated seismograph networks in the region where the Chalfant Valley earthquake sequence occurred. The data that was captured was transmitted in real time to [[Reno, Nevada]] and [[Menlo Park, California]] and was digitized for later examination. The [[foreshock]] activity was found to have begun eighteen days prior to the main event on July 3, with the onset of a 3.5 event ([[Richter magnitude scale|local magnitude]]). Activity increased on July 18 with several double events then reduced again in the hours prior to the primary M5.7 (intensity V (''Moderate'')) foreshock on July 20. All forty events that were recorded by the UNR and USGS stations before that event were within {{convert|2|km|abbr=on}} its epicenter, and another 132 events that were considered to be its aftershocks were documented in the remaining 24 hours leading up to the mainshock. One of these events, just over two hours after the primary foreshock, reached M4.7 with an intensity of IV (''Light'').<ref name=Stover/><ref>{{citation|title=The foreshock sequence of the 1986 Chalfant, California, earthquake|url=ftp://ftp.ingv.it/pub/lauro.chiaraluce/.../Kenneth_EtAl_BSSA_1988.pdf|first=K.D.|last=Smith|first2=K.F.|last2=Priestley|year=1988|journal=Bulletin of the Seismological Society of America|publisher=[[Seismological Society of America]]|volume=78|number=1|pages=173, 177}}</ref>

==Earthquake==
[[File:USGS Shakemap - 1986 Chalfant Valley earthquake.jpg|thumb|USGS ShakeMap for the Chalfant Valley mainshock]]
{{see also|List of earthquakes in California}}

The mainshock occurred at {{Tooltip|07:42:26|14:42:26 UTC}} on July 21 and caused the most damage in the sequence of events. The shock measured 6.4 (local magnitude) as measured by the [[Berkeley Seismological Laboratory]] and originated at a depth of approximately {{convert|10.8|km|sp=us}}. The [[focal mechanism]]s of the three largest events (the July 20 foreshock, the mainshock, and the largest aftershock) were primarily [[Strike-slip tectonics|strike-slip]] with a minor amount of [[Fault (geology)#Dip-slip faults|normal-slip]] and were especially well-constrained due to the dense array of [[seismometer]]s in the area that were operated by the UNR and the USGS. The primary foreshock's preferred fault plane solution indicated left-lateral slip on a fault striking N25<U+00B0>E, but neither the mainshock nor the largest aftershock conformed with their right-lateral slip striking N25<U+00B0>W and N15<U+00B0>W respectively.<ref name=Cockerham>{{citation|title=The July 1986 Chalfant Valley, California, earthquake sequence: Preliminary results |url=http://www.bssaonline.org/content/77/1/280.extract|first=R.S.|last=Cockerham|first2=E.J.|last2=Corbett|year=1987|journal=Bulletin of the Seismological Society of America|publisher=[[Seismological Society of America]]|volume=77|number=1|pages=280<U+2013>285}}</ref>

===Damage===
In Bishop, windows were shattered and ceiling tiles fell in several buildings, and a portion of the brick [[facade]] at the First Sierra bank building fell onto the sidewalk. A Burger King restaurant had part of its ceiling come down. Northwest of Bishop, a portion of [[U.S. Route 395]] was blocked temporarily by a [[landslide]]. [[Camping|Campers]] were briefly trapped at the Pleasant Valley Reservoir when a {{convert|150|ft|abbr=on}} section of an access road was destroyed as a result of land movement. Both injuries that were reported occurred to the north in Chalfant Valley (minor cuts and injuries from falling objects) where 53 [[mobile home]]s were knocked off their foundations and two homes were destroyed. Nearly all the buildings in that small town were affected, with water and sewer lines broken there as well.<ref name=lat_Jul23>{{cite news|title=6.1 Quake Jars Eastern Sierra : State's 4th Temblor in Two Weeks Damages Homes, Traps Campers|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1986-07-22/news/mn-30582_1_eastern-sierra|first=George|last=Ramos|first2=Kenneth|last2=Reich|date=July 22, 1986|newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]]}}</ref>

Many of the mobile homes were able to be remounted on their foundations, but 18<U+2013>20 of the homes were unable to be repaired. The overall damage from the event was compared with the other events in [[southern California]]. While the Oceanside shock caused $200,000 in damage, the Palm Springs event caused an estimated $8 million in damage. Damage in from the Chalfant Valley event was estimated at $2.7 million.<ref name=Stover/><ref>{{cite news|title=More Big Temblors Could Rock Sierra in Next Few Days|first=George|last=Ramos|first2=Kenneth|last2=Reich|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1986-07-23/news/mn-21554_1_geological-survey|date=July 23, 1986|newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]]}}</ref>

===Surface faulting===
Ground fractures that were deemed to be tectonic in nature were documented on about {{convert|10.5|km|sp=us}} of the White Mountain Fault Zone from Silver Creek to Piute Creek. The cracks trended 350<U+00B0> and a maximum right-lateral slip of about {{convert|11|cm|sp=us}} was measured, though other vertical (downslope) or extensional movement was also seen, especially on the {{convert|150|m|sigfig=1|abbr=on}}-thick surface of the Bishop Tuff in the Volcanic Tableland. There, the largest displacements were seen in the vicinity of Casa Diablo Mountain. The cracks were found primarily in loose sand, which made measurements difficult.<ref>{{citation|title=Fault fractures formed in association with the 1986 Chalfant Valley, California, earthquake sequence: Preliminary report|url=ftp://ftp.gps.caltech.edu/pub/avouac/OwensValley/Lienkaemperetal1987.pdf|first=J.J.|last=Lienkaemper|first2=S.K.|last2=Pezzopane|first3=M.M.|last3=Clark|first4=M.J.|last4=Rymer|year=1987|journal=Bulletin of the Seismological Society of America|publisher=[[Seismological Society of America]]|volume=77|number=1|pages=297, 298, 301, 302}}</ref>

===Aftershocks===

The day of the main event two moderate aftershocks occurred (5.6 at 14:51 and 5.4 at 22:07) and ten days following the mainshock on July 31, another stronger aftershock occurred with a local magnitude of 5.8 and a depth of {{convert|9.2|km|sp=us}}. That aftershock was felt in California and western Nevada, broke windows and knocked items of shelves in Bishop, and light fixtures were damaged at the [[National Weather Service]] office.<ref name=Stover/><ref name=Cockerham/>

===Strong motion===

The foreshock, mainshock, and the two largest aftershocks were recorded by strong motion stations that were operated by the California Strong Motion Instrumentation Program (CSMIP) and the [[United States Geological Survey|USGS]]. A total of 36 [[seismogram]]s were captured from 11 stations, including a two story steel frame building, the [[Crowley Lake|Long Valley Dam]], and several free field stations. The Chalfant strong motion station recorded the largest horizontal accelerations for the foreshock, mainshock, and the July 21 M5.6 aftershock of .28''g'', .46''g'', and .17''g''. The instruments at the building on North Main street in Bishop recorded all four shocks and indicated .25''g'' at ground level and .4''g'' on the roof, both during the mainshock. The station at the earthen Long Valley Dam had produced many quality recordings since being put into operation in 1979 and saw mainshock accelerations of .09''g'' on [[bedrock]], and .24''g'' on an upper [[abutment]].<ref>{{citation|title=CSMIP strong-motion records from the Chalfant Valley, California earthquakes|url=http://www.consrv.ca.gov/cgs/smip/docs/reports/EQData/Documents/OSMS_86-06.pdf|first=R.W.|last=Sherburne|first2=D.L.|last2=Parke|first3=M.J.|last3=Huang|first4=A.F.|last4=Shakal|year=1988|series=Report OSMS 86-06, California Strong Motion Instrumentation Program|publisher=[[California Geological Survey|California Division of Mines and Geology]]|pages=1<U+2013>3}}</ref>
