'''Sif''' ("In-law-relationship"<ref name=LINDOW>Lindow, John. (2001) ''Norse Mythology: A Guide to the Gods, Heroes, Rituals, and Beliefs'', page 266. Oxford: Oxford University Press. ISBN 0-19-515382-0.</ref>) is a goddess in [[Norse mythology]]. Sif only appears in the [[Poetic Edda]], compiled in the 13th century from earlier traditional sources, and the [[Prose Edda]], written in the 13th century by [[Snorri Sturluson]]. In these two sources, she is known for her [[Blond|golden hair]], as the wife of the major god [[Thor]] and, in the [[Euhemerus|euhemerized]] prologue of the Prose Edda, as the most beautiful of women.<ref name=BYOPRO6> Byock, Jesse. (Trans.) (2006) ''The Prose Edda'', page 6. Penguin Classics ISBN 0140447555</ref>

In surviving tales, Sif is the mother of [[<U+00DE>r<U+00FA><U+00F0>r]], by Thor, and mother of the seemingly once major god [[Ullr]] by a father unrecorded in surviving sources. However, the source lists Thor as his stepfather without further explanation.<ref name=STEPTHOR> This is accounted for in chapter 31 of ''[[Gylfaginning]]'', a book of the [[Prose Edda]].</ref> [[Sif Mons]], a [[List of montes on Venus|monte of the planet Venus]], is named after Sif.

==Characteristic golden hair==
Sif was so associated with her hair that in the [[Prose Edda]] book ''[[Sk<U+00E1>ldskaparm<U+00E1>l]]'', the "hair of Sif" is listed as a [[kenning]] for [[gold]].<ref name=BYOPRO92>Byock, Jesse. (Trans.) (2006) ''The Prose Edda'', page 92. Penguin Classics ISBN 0140447555</ref> English scholar [[H. R. Ellis Davidson]] states that Sif may have been an ancient fertility goddess, proposing the link between her lustrous hair and fields of [[wheat|golden wheat]].<ref name=GODSDAV>[[H. R. Ellis Davidson|Ellis Davidson, H. R.]] (1965) ''Gods And Myths Of Northern Europe'', page 84. ISBN 0140136274</ref> Davidson further asserts that Thor was described as born from [[J<U+00F6>r<U+00F0>]] (a personification of earth) and a kenning in ''Sk<U+00E1>ldskaparm<U+00E1>l'' directly associates the two, referring to earth as the "mother-in-law of Sif".<ref name=BYOPRO112>Byock, Jesse. (Trans.) (2006) ''The Prose Edda'', page 112. Penguin Classics ISBN 0140447555</ref>

==Poetic Edda==
In the Poetic Edda, Sif appears in or is mentioned in ''[[H<U+00E1>rbar<U+00F0>slj<U+00F3><U+00F0>]]'', ''[[Hymiskvi<U+00F0>a]]'' (where Thor is referred to three times as the "Husband of Sif"), ''[[Lokasenna]]'', and ''[[<U+00DE>rymskvi<U+00F0>a]]'' (where the "Husband of Sif" kenning appears once more).

===''H<U+00E1>rbar<U+00F0>slj<U+00F3><U+00F0>''===
In the section 48 of the [[Poetic Edda]] poem ''[[H<U+00E1>rbar<U+00F0>slj<U+00F3><U+00F0>]]'', [[Odin]] (in the disguise of [[List of names of Odin|H<U+00E1>rbar<U+00F0>r]]) meets his son [[Thor]] at an [[inlet]] of a gulf. The two engage in [[flyting]] and H<U+00E1>rbar<U+00F0>r refuses to [[ferry]] Thor across the bay. Amongst numerous other insults, H<U+00E1>rbar<U+00F0>r claims that Sif has a lover at home. However, Thor responds that H<U+00E1>rbar<U+00F0>r is speaking carelessly and lying.

===''Lokasenna''===
In stanzas 53 and 54 of the late poem ''[[Lokasenna]]'', after pouring Loki a crystal cup of [[mead]] during his series of insults towards the gods, Sif states that there is nothing Loki can say only in regard to her. In response, [[Loki]] claims that Sif has had an affair with him. Mountains shake and Thor arrives. After some initial exchanges between Thor and Loki, prose references are made to events described in ''[[V<U+00F6>lusp<U+00E1>]]'' and the Prose Edda. The exchange involving Sif reads as follows:

{|
|
:''Then Sif went forward and poured out mead for Loki into a crystal cup and said:''
::Welcome now, Loki, and take the crystal cup
::full of ancient mead,
::you should admit, that of the children of the <U+00C6>sir,
::that I alone am blameless.
:
:''He took the horn and drank it down:
::That indeed you would be, if you were so,
::if you were shy and fierce towards men;
::I alone know, as I think I do know,
::your love beside Thor,
::and that was the wicked Loki.<ref name=LARRINGTON>Larrington, Carolyne. (Trans.) (1999) ''The Poetic Edda'', page 93. ISBN 0192839462</ref>

Modern scholars such as Lee Hollander explain that ''Lokasenna'' was intended to be humorous and that the accusations thrown by Loki in the poem are not necessarily to be taken as "generally accepted lore" at the time it was composed. Rather they are charges that are easy for Loki to make and difficult for his targets to disprove, or which they do not care to refute.<ref name=POEEDDHOLL>Hollander, Lee. (Trans.) (1990) ''The Poetic Edda'' (2nd edition) Introduction to "Lokasenna", page 90. University of Texas Press ISBN 0292764995</ref>

==Prose Edda==
In the Prose Edda, Sif is mentioned once in the prologue, in chapter 31 of ''[[Gylfaginning]]'', in sections 3, 5, 6, (as a guest at [[<U+00C6>gir|<U+00C6>gir's]] feast, a reference to ''Lokasenna'') and in various kennings towards the end of ''[[Sk<U+00E1>ldskaparm<U+00E1>l]]''.

===Prologue===
Sif is introduced in chapter three of Snorri's euhemerized account of the origins of [[Norse mythology]] serving as a Prologue for the Prose Edda. Snorri states that Thor married her and that she is know as "a prophetess called [[Sibyl]], though we know her as Sif"<ref name=BYOPRO6/> though to the extent of this implication some debate has existed. Sif is further described as "the most loveliest of women"<ref name=BYOPRO6/> and with hair of gold. Although he lists her own ancestors as unknown, Snorri also attributes an extended genealogical list of descendants to the couple of Thor and Sif, including figures such as [[Godwulf]] and Odin, though outside of this continuity Odin is described as the father of Thor.

===''Gylfaginning''===
In chapter 31 of ''Gylfaginning'', Ullr is referred to as a son of Sif and a stepson of Thor though his father is not mentioned:

<blockquote>''Ull is the name of one. The son of Sif, he is the stepson of Thor. He is so skillful a bowman and skier that no one can compete with him. He is beautiful to look at, and is an accomplished warrior. He is also a good person to pray to when in single combat.''<ref name=BYOPRO38>Byock, Jesse. (Trans.) ''The Prose Edda'', page 38. (2006) Penguin Classics ISBN 0140447555</ref></blockquote>

===''Sk<U+00E1>ldskaparm<U+00E1>l''===
Section 3 of ''Sk<U+00E1>ldskaparm<U+00E1>l'', Thor engages in a duel with [[Hrungnir]], there described as the strongest of the [[J<U+00F6>tunn]]. Prior to this, Hrungnir had been boasting of his desire to, amongst other things, kill all of the gods except [[Freyja]] and Sif, whom he wanted to take home with him. However, at the duel, Hrungnir is quickly killed by the enraged Thor.

In section 5 of ''Sk<U+00E1>ldskaparm<U+00E1>l'', Snorri relates a story where [[Loki]] cuts off Sif's hair as a prank. When Thor discovers this, he grabs hold of Loki, resulting in Loki swearing to have a headpiece made of gold to replace Sif's locks. Loki fulfills this promise by having a headpiece made by [[dwarves]] referred to as the "sons of [[Ivaldi]]". Along with the headpiece, the dwarves produced [[Odin|Odin's]] spear, [[Gungnir]]. Further, as the story progresses, this event leads to the creation of the ship of the ship [[Sk<U+00ED><U+00F0>bla<U+00F0>nir]] and the boar [[Gullinbursti]] for [[Freyr]], the multiplying ring [[Draupnir]] for [[Odin]], and the mighty hammer [[Mjolnir]] for Thor.

Suggestions have been made regarding the potentially understated mythological importance of Sif's role in this story, as the creation of her headpiece results here in some of the most legendary and powerful items in Norse mythology.<ref name=LINDOW/>
