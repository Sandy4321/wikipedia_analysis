'''S.H.E''' is a [[Taiwan]]ese [[girl group]] whose members are [[Selina Ren]], [[Hebe Tian]] and [[Ella Chen]]. The name of the group is an [[alphabetism]] derived from the first letter of each member's name. In 2000, Ren, Tian and Chen signed up for a singing contest. The winner, Ren, was awarded a record contract; Tian and Chen, who were both finalists, joined Ren to form S.H.E. The group produces albums under the [[HIM International Music]] label. [[Avex Trax|Avex Asia]] distributed S.H.E's music in [[Hong Kong]], but transferred this role to [[WOW Music]] in 2007. [[EMI|EMI Music China]] is the distributor in [[Singapore]] and the [[People's Republic of China]].

S.H.E has recorded 10 albums, with sales of more than 4.5 million since releasing their first album ''[[Girl's Dorm|Girls Dorm]]'' (2001), and set ticketing records in each of their two concert tours. The group has acted in seven [[Taiwanese drama|drama series]], hosted two variety shows, and contributed 10 songs to six drama soundtracks. S.H.E has endorsed more than 30 companies and products, including [[Coca-Cola]] and [[World of Warcraft]].<ref name="cc">{{zh icon}} Han, Lei, Shi Xisheng and Kan Wenting.

Largely due to S.H.E's success, other Taiwanese record labels began forming their own girl groups.

== Background ==
===The Universal Talent and Beauty Girl Contest===

On [[August 12]][[2000]] Taiwanese record label HIM International held open auditions, searching for new talent to complement [[Power Station (Taiwanese band)|Power Station]]. During the auditions, [[Taipei]] native Jen Chia-Hs<U+00FC>an sang [[Coco Lee]]'s "Before I Fall In Love". Tien Fu-Chen, who hailed from [[Hsinchu City|Hsinchu]], sang [[Shunza]]'s "Write a Song".<ref>{{zh icon}} [http://ent.sina.com.cn/p/2004-09-14/1809504081.html S.H.E's Life Story, Part 1: First auditions for the "Cruel Stage" segment of ''TV Citizen''].

Retrieved February 13, 2007.</ref> All three passed, and were recommended to the Universal Talent and Beauty Girl Contest. The preliminary rounds of the contest were held on [[August 20]], [[2000]] in [[New York City]]. Entering the final preliminary round, Jen Chia-Hs<U+00FC>an was slated to sing [[Elva Hsiao]]'s "The Closest Stranger"; both Tien and Chen planned on singing [[Karen Mok]]'s "Cloudy Sky".<ref name="part2"/> All three girls passed, and secured three of seven spots in the TV round.

Once the contestants reached [[China Television|CTV]]'s "TV Citizen", the televised portion of the contest, Tien Fu-Chen was scheduled to perform first, followed by Jen Chia-Hs<U+00FC>an.<ref name="part2"/> During the television round, each of the five judges turned a light on if a singing flaw was identified; a total of three lights resulted in elimination. Jen Chia-Hs<U+00FC>an sang [[Christina Aguilera]]'s "Reflection", but her singing flaws earned her two lights. Tien Fu-Chen sang [[Kit Chan]]'s "Loving You"; despite forgetting the majority of the lyrics, she was given only two lights. Chen Chia-Hwa chose [[Rene Liu]]'s "Afterwards", but was eliminated after receiving four lights.<ref name="part2"/> At the end of the round, only four contestants remained, two of whom were Jen Chia-Hs<U+00FC>an and Tien Fu-Chen. Among the four, the judges selected Jen as the winner, and awarded her a record contract with HIM International. Later that summer, HIM International contacted Chen and Tien, and asked both girls to audition once again. After a few test recordings, HIM signed both Chen Chia-Hwa and Tien Fu-Chen to record contracts.<ref name="part2"/>

===Origin of the name===
After recording the songs for their first album, Jen Chia-Hs<U+00FC>an, Tien Fu-Chen and Chen Chia-Hwa needed a group name. The company suggested several names, including H.B.O, Digi Girl, 3C Girls (3C <U+7F8E><U+5C11><U+5973>), and S.H.E Girl Friends (S.H.E <U+5973><U+670B><U+53CB>). The name Digi Girl would have reflected HIM's endorsement of Digimaster products, whereas H.B.O would have coincided with one of the songs on the girls' first album.<ref name="she4">{{zh icon}} Sina.com. [http://ent.sina.com.cn/p/2004-09-14/1812504086.html S.H.E's Life Story, Part 4: S.H.E's Name]. September 14, 2004. Retrieved February 13, 2007.</ref> HIM finally decided on S.H.E; as a result, Jen Chia-Hs<U+00FC>an became Selina, Tien Fu-Chen became Hebe, and Chen Chia-Hwa became Ella.

The group's name, S.H.E, was selected for two reasons. Once the dots in S.H.E were removed, the resulting word would emphasize the fact that S.H.E was a girl group; the dots would have symbolized individual differences between the three members. Secondly, by having an English name, the group would be more accessible to an international audience.<ref name="she4"/> However, there were concerns about how audiences would react to such a name; it was sufficiently similar to [[S.E.S. (group)|S.E.S.]], a then-established Korean girl group, that it was thought S.H.E might be labelled as plagiarists.<ref name="she4"/> As a result, HIM provided local audiences with an alternative Chinese name for their new group: <U+5973><U+670B><U+53CB> ({{CJKV|p=n<U+01DA> p<U+00E9>ngy<U+014F>u|l=girl friends}}).<ref name="she4"/>

S.H.E has released ten [[studio albums]] to date, including two [[compilation album]]s. All of S.H.E's album covers display an [[oxalis]], the symbol for the group. On some covers, the clover is easy to spot (''Girls Dorm'', ''Together'', ''Encore'', ''Forever''); on other covers, its appearance is more subtle (''Super Star'', ''Once Upon a Time''). S.H.E's other contributions include songs in the soundtracks of ''Magical Love'', ''The Rose'', ''Reaching for the Stars'', ''[[Tokyo Juliet]]'', ''The Little Fairy'', and ''[[Hanazakarino Kimitachihe]]''. 

All three members have different vocal ranges to complement each other. Ella sings within the alto to mezzo-soprano range, while Hebe and Selina sing within the mezzo-soprano to soprano range.<ref>{{zh icon}} UDN Stars. United Daily News.

Most S.H.E songs fall into the category of [[pop music]]. Songs from this genre consist of light melodies,<ref>{{zh icon}} Singtao News. [http://www.singtaonet.com:82/ent/comment/t20060324_183519.html ''Kung Fu'' brings revival to the Mainland [China] music scene]. March 24, 2006. Retrieved March 2, 2007.</ref> simple drum beats, and the occasional piano or synthesizer accompaniment. In ''Girls Dorm'' and ''Youth Society'', acoustic guitar melody lines were used as well. While some slower songs, particularly those in ''Genesis'', fall into the genre of [[R&B]],<ref name="b"/> high-tempo songs, such as "Beauty Up My Life", focus more on [[techno]]. S.H.E has also sung a few [[pop/rock]] songs, including "Piquancy", "Super Star", and "Star Light" As their career progressed, S.H.E began mixing light-hearted pop ballads with elements of [[hip hop]] and [[Dance music|dance]]. Attempts to fuse these genres started with songs such as "If You're Happy, Then I'll Be Pleased", which contained a short rap segment, and evolved into songs such as "Listen to Yuan Wei-jen Play Guitar", which is composed entirely of rap with the exception of the chorus.

===Lyrics===
As performers, S.H.E does not write the lyrics for the majority of their songs. Shi Rencheng (<U+65BD><U+4EBA><U+8AA0>), who also writes for artists such as [[Rene Liu]], [[Jordan Chan]], and [[Yuki Hsu]], has been S.H.E's main lyricist since the group's debut. Some even say that Shi's "legendary" lyrics were partially responsible for the trio's success.<ref>{{zh icon}} [http://ent.sina.com.cn/x/2006-07-20/03241164691.html Digging up the Fuzhou version of S.H.E].

Hebe wrote the words for "Say You Love Me", and penned the rap portion of "If You're Happy, Then I'll Be Pleased". Selina was responsible for the lyrics of "Wifey".

Most of S.H.E's songs are about love. The word "love" ({{zh-cp|c=[[wikt:<U+611B>|<U+611B>]]|p=<U+00E0>i}}) appears in six song titles, and over 270 times in the lyrics alone. "Love", in its original English, is not only found in three song titles, but also countless times in the songs themselves. Related words, such as "embrace" ({{zh-cp|c=[[wikt:<U+64C1><U+62B1>|<U+64C1><U+62B1>]]|p=y<U+014D>ng b<U+00E0>o}}) and "feeling" ({{zh-cp|c=[[wikt:<U+611F><U+89BA>|<U+611F><U+89BA>]]|p=g<U+01CE>n ju<U+00E9>}}), appear nearly 40 times. Occasionally, love stories are taken from literature and put into song. Examples include "Laurel Tree Goddess (Daphne)", which is based on the story of [[Apollo]] and [[Daphne]],<ref>{{zh icon}} [http://www.hitoradio.com/showtime/4a_3_1.php?re_id=353 Hitoradio Research Centre: Laurel Tree Goddess (Daphne)].

S.H.E's albums contain quite a number of [[cover version|cover]] songs. Among the group's 90 songs, 25 are covers. Earlier albums often included cover songs; however, since 2004, the group has recorded no more than two covers per album. In most covers, the songs' original titles were kept. Other songs, such as Westlife's "Soledad", were simply given new Chinese titles. The lyrics are usually rewritten, but some songs, such as Charlene's "I've Never Been To Me", are sung in their original English. While the musical style is usually maintained, some covers, such as "Only Lonely" and "I.O.I.O", have a lighter, [[bubblegum pop]] feel. 

Older pieces and nursery rhymes are occasionally parodied. "Don't Wanna Grow Up" is a parody of [[Symphony No. 40 (Mozart)|Mozart's 40th Symphony]], and "London Bridge is Falling Down" is based on the [[London Bridge is Falling Down|children's song of the same name]]. The verses of "Thanks for Your Gentleness" are original compositions, but the chorus is borrowed from [[Wu Yue Tian|Mayday]]'s "Gentle and Soft". 

S.H.E's covers are generally less popular than their original works. During the group's career, original compositions have combined for nearly 20 awards, whereas covers have been lauded only twice.{{ref_label|G|g|none}}

One of S.H.E's hallmarks is their friendship. This bonding is apparent in several music videos, such as "Five Days, Four Nights" (<U+4E94><U+5929><U+56DB><U+591C>).

== Criticism ==
====Lack of originality====
A review of S.H.E's 2005 album ''Once Upon A Time'' described the majority of the songs as "mundane", "predictable" and no better than "mushy pop standards", indicating that little has changed over their career.<ref>Phipps, Gavin.

May 12, 2007.</ref> An article in ''Style Weekly'', a Chinese fashion magazine, asserted that the trio's songs, compared to those of "talented musicians",{{ref_label|I|i|none}} are lyrically weaker because they only reflect the female view of love.<ref>{{zh icon}} Style Weekly.

The group's regular covering of songs has also earned some ire over the years. After the release of the [[Reaching for the Stars (soundtrack)|''Reaching for the Stars'' soundtrack]] in 2005, there were accusations on Internet forums stating that the song "Star Light" (<U+661F><U+5149>) sounded suspiciously similar to [[Ayumi Hamasaki]]'s "[[My Story (Ayumi Hamasaki album)#CD track listing|About You]]". In response, S.H.E declared that "Star Light" and "about you" were completely different, and did not even sound similar to each other.<ref>{{zh icon}} [http://ent.tom.com/1306/1362/2005926-153521.html Performing aspects of sadist-masochist [culture] using closed cages, S.H.E spends 1 million to make hot music video] September 26, 2005.

====A group in decline?====
In a 2004 review of female artists in [[Greater China]], S.H.E was given an 80% [[approval rating]], while archrivals [[Twins (group)|Twins]] received a mere 50%. The difference in quality was apparently so great that there was no reason for S.H.E to be concerned.<ref>{{zh icon}} Epoch Times.

== Influence and impact ==
===Musical===
By 2001, the vast majority of notable singing groups in Taiwan{{ref_label|J|j|none}} were male. When S.H.E was formed, other girl groups were only beginning to earn their fame in the Taiwanese music industry, but few would last more than two years. Formed in 2000, [[4 in Love]] had similar success to S.H.E during their first year in the entertainment business, but broke up less than two years later.<ref>{{zh icon}} aigo MUSIC. [http://cn.aigomusic.com/newspage/21820.ftl Rise and fall of singing groups - 4 in Love]. September 7, 2006. Retrieved March 3, 2007.</ref> Among the former members of 4 in Love, [[Rainie Yang]] is the only member to have continued her singing career. Other groups, such as Walkie Talkie ({{zh-c|<U+9326><U+7E61><U+4E8C><U+91CD><U+5531>}}), were formed as a result of talent competitions, but were less notable during the course of their careers.<ref name="ggrouphistory">{{zh icon}} Ke Erqin.

Retrieved February 28, 2007.</ref> Over a year after S.H.E's formation, the state of girl groups in Taiwan had changed little. In January 2003, radio station UFM1003 released a list of its Top 10 Taiwanese Pop Groups for the year 2002. Although S.H.E was ranked first, they were the only all-female group on the list.<ref>{{zh icon}} Hong Minghua. [http://stars.zaobao.com/foreignstar/pages2/stars080103.html Mainland and Taiwanese artists go head-to-head]. January 8, 2003. Retrieved March 3, 2007.</ref>

During the course of S.H.E's career, a significant number of musical groups were introduced by their companies as "the next S.H.E" with hopes of emulating their success. When Warner Music Taiwan wanted to form a three-person boy band, they planned on marketing them as "the male version of S.H.E" before coming up with the name "G-Boys".<ref name="gboys"/> Other groups, meanwhile, were formed to topple S.H.E's standing as Taiwan's premier pop group. In fact, Jungiery Star manager Sun Derong stated that [[7 Flowers]] was formed just to provide competition for S.H.E.<ref>{{zh icon}} [http://www.inkui.com/a4/2016/2016353.html Secretive girl group, 7 Flowers, competes with S.H.E]. March 24, 2004. Retrieved February 28, 2007.</ref> Despite the increase in competition, S.H.E maintains a definitive stranglehold on the [[Mandopop]] group awards, suggesting that the formation of these new groups has done little to ruffle the trio's feathers.

===Other===
According to [[Baidu]]'s year-end Top Search Terms survey, the most-searched movie of 2004 was ''[[House of Flying Daggers]]'' ({{zh-c|c=<U+5341><U+9762><U+57CB><U+4F0F>}}). The phrase logged more than 1.2 million searches, which was nearly twice as many as second place (''[[Kung Fu Hustle]]''). Baidu attributed this difference to the fact that S.H.E had released a song with the same name earlier that year. As a result, searches for the song were lumped together with the movie, thereby inflating the latter's search totals.<ref>{{zh icon}} [http://www.baidu.com/2004/ Baidu Top Search Terms 2004].

S.H.E has also influenced television dramas, education systems, and even business operations. In the ''[[I Not Stupid Too]]'' television series, Chengcai, the [[Chinese martial arts|wushu]]-practicing protagonist, was courted by three members of the school's chess society: Shirley, Helen, and Elaine, who were collectively known as S.H.E.<ref>{{zh icon}} "The Best Extracurricular Activity".

==Notes==
<div class="references-small" style="-moz-column-count:2; -column-count:2">
* '''a.'''{{note_label|A|a|none}} See [[S.H.E#Television and film career|Television and film career]].
* '''b.'''{{note_label|B|b|none}} If you search "<U+5973><U+5B50><U+7B2C><U+4E00><U+5929><U+5718>" with "S.H.E" on Chinese search engines, the only results available are written after the release of ''Encore''.
* '''c.'''{{note_label|C|c|none}} Although the English translations of the song and album are different, the Chinese names are the same ({{zh-tsp|t=<U+4E0D><U+60F3><U+9577><U+5927>|s=<U+4E0D><U+60F3><U+957F><U+5927>|p=B<U+00F9> Xi<U+01CE>ng Zh<U+01CE>ng D<U+00E0>}}).
* '''d.'''{{note_label|D|d|none}} The article states that Ella is an alto, but there have been instances when Ella sings slightly above the alto range (''i.e.'' into the mezzo soprano range) in songs such as "What to Do?" and "Don't Wanna Grow Up". Similarly Hebe and Selina are listed in the article as sopranos, but there have been songs, such as "Persian Cat", where they sang notes more fitting for a mezzo-soprano.
* '''e.'''{{note_label|E|e|none}} Yao wrote the lyrics for "Wisteria" (<U+7D2B><U+85E4><U+82B1>), "A Vision Of Eternity" (<U+4E00><U+773C><U+842C><U+5E74>), "I Love You" (<U+6211><U+611B><U+4F60>) and "Romeo and Juliet" (<U+8331><U+7F85><U+8A18>).
* '''f.'''{{note_label|F|f|none}} Fang's lyrics are found in five songs: "Riverside Park" (<U+6CB3><U+6FF1><U+516C><U+5712>), "Norse Mythology" (<U+5317><U+6B50><U+795E><U+8A71>), "Laurel Goddess - Daphne" (<U+6708><U+6842><U+5973><U+795E>), "Tropical Rainforest" (<U+71B1><U+5E36><U+96E8><U+6797>), and "Migratory Bird" (<U+4FAF><U+9CE5>). The last two songs, which Fang co-produced with Jay Chou, are both Annual Best Singles (2002 and 2004, respectively).
* '''g.'''{{note_label|G|g|none}} See [[List of S.H.E Awards]].
* '''h.'''{{note_label|H|h|none}} The Chinese name for ''Reaching For The Stars'', Zhen Ming Tian N<U+00FC> (<U+771F><U+547D><U+5929><U+5973>), is derived from the Chinese name for the group [[Destiny's Child]], Tian Ming Zhen N<U+00FC> (<U+5929><U+547D><U+771F><U+5973>). Coincidentally, the plot of the drama revolves around three girls who seemed destined to meet each other.
* '''i.'''{{note_label|I|i|none}} The magazine article refers to artists like [[Richie Ren]] (who was also mentioned in the article) as "talented types", while S.H.E qualified as an "idol type".
* '''j.'''{{note_label|J|j|none}} The usage of "Taiwan" in this article, unless otherwise specified, refers to the Taiwanese music industry (as opposed to the China and Hong Kong music industries).
* '''k.'''{{note_label|K|k|none}} HIM announced the Xuite blog on [[April 20]][[2007]] initially as a countdown for the album ''Play''.<ref>{{zh icon}} HIM International Music. [http://www.wretch.cc/blog/SHE911&article_id=17793535 The first countdown to the release date begins!] April 20, 2007. Retrieved June 28, 2007.</ref>
