'''''Liaoceratops''''', meaning "Liao Horned Face", is a [[ceratopsian]] [[dinosaur]] believed to be an early relative of the horned [[ceratopsid]]s. It lived in the early [[Cretaceous]], some 130 million years ago. It was discovered in [[China]] by a team of American and Chinese scientists.  ''Liaoceratops'' was much smaller than its later relatives, but offers a glimpse into the early [[evolution]] of this group of dinosaurs.

==Discoveries and naming==
''Liaoceratops'' was discovered in the famous [[Liaoning]] Province of China, where several [[fossils]] of feathered dinosaurs have also been collected.
The [[type species]] ''Liaoceratops yanzigouensis'' was in 2002 named and described by [[Xu Xing (paleontologist)|Xu Xing]], [[Peter Makovicky]], [[Wang Xiaolin]], [[Mark Norell]] and [[You Hailu]]. The generic name is derived from [[Liaoning]] and the Greek ''keras'', "horn" and ''ops'', "face". The [[specific name (zoology)|specific name]] refers to the town [[Yanzigou]].

The holotype '''IVPP V12738''' has been found in the [[Yixian Formation]] dating from the [[Berremian]]. These beds have also yielded fossil [[insects]], fossils of [[ginkgo]] trees, and many other dinosaurs, including the early [[Troodontidae|troodontid]] ''[[Sinovenator]]'', also described by Makovicky later in 2005. 

"This area is yielding extremely important information on the evolution of dinosaurs, [[mammals]], insects, and flowering [[plants]]. I hope to find even more primitive specimens than ''Liaoceratops''," Peter Makovicky said.

The holotype consists of an almost complete skull. As [[paratype]] specimen IVPP V12633 has been referred, the skull of a juvenile. In 2007 another skull, CAGS-IG-VD-002, of an even younger individual was referred. This lacked the skull roof, which has been explained as the result of a predator opening the braincase to eat the contents.<ref>You, H., Tanoue, K., and Dodson, P., 2007, "A new specimen of ''Liaoceratops yanzigouensis'' (Dinosauria: Neoceratopsia) from the Early Cretaceous of  Liaoning Province, China", ''Acta Geologica Sinica'' '''81'''(6): 898-904</ref>

==Description and classification==
''Liaoceratops'' is rather small, with a holotype skull length of 154 millimetres, weighing an estimated seven pounds and possessing only jugal horns and a small skull frill, lacking the orbital horns and true neck shield that characterized later ceratopsians. However, these features help understand a major split in the evolution of ceratopsians. Long before the familiar ''[[Triceratops]]'' evolved in [[North America]], the ceratopsian lineage branched into two lines: the [[Neoceratopia|neoceratopsians]], the main lineage that includes the recognizable horned and frilled forms, and of which ''Liaoceratops'' in 2002 was the most basal known member, and the [[Psittacosauridae]], a radiation of smaller, parrot-beaked dinosaurs.

"''Liaoceratops'' gives us a great window on the early evolution of horned dinosaurs and tells us that ''Triceratops'' and its relatives evolved from very small Asian ceratopsians. This small, primitive dinosaur is actually more interesting to [[science]] in many ways than its larger, more famous relatives because it teaches us more about evolution. Basal dinosaurs are critical because they help us to tie different groups of dinosaurs together and map out evolutionary patterns," said Peter Makovicky, Curator of Dinosaurs at the [[Field Museum of Natural History|Field Museum]] in [[Chicago]] and a co-author of the paper describing the dinosaur.

"''Liaoceratops'' establishes that this split occurred no later than the earliest part of the [[Cretaceous]] Period. Also, it indicates that ceratopsians acquired some of their distinctive features earlier and more rapidly than was previously recognized," Makovicky said.

==Function of the horns and frill==
Ironically, the diminutive ''Liaoceratops'' may also help scientists understand the roles of horns and frills in ceratopsian dinosaurs. First thought of as offensive or defensive organs, these structures are seen by many [[paleontologists]] today as display devices used in species recognition and to attract mates. ''Liaoceratops'' has a small jugal horn facing sideways under and behind each of its eyes. As this structure is relatively small and light, Makovicky believed that it was a display organ and had no purpose in defense.
