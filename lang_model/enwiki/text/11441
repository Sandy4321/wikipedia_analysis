'''The Muppets''', branded as '''Disney's The Muppets''' since 2004,<ref>{{cite web|title=The Muppets On Stage with Cee Lo Green in Las Vegas!|url=http://blogs.disney.com/movies/2012/10/12/the-muppets-on-stage-with-ceelo-green-in-las-vegas/|work=[[The Walt Disney Company]]|publisher=Disney Blogs|accessdate=27 November 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Lipshutz|first=Jason|title=CeeLo Green's Christmas Album To Feature Christina Aguilera, The Muppets|url=http://www.billboard.com/news/ceelo-green-s-christmas-album-to-feature-1007954702.story#/news/ceelo-green-s-christmas-album-to-feature-1007954702.story|accessdate=27 November 2012|newspaper=[[Billboard (magazine)|''Billboard'']]|date=20 September 2012}}</ref> are a group of [[Sketch comedy|sketch comedy]] [[Variety show|variety]] [[puppet]] characters known for their absurdist, burlesque and self-referential comedy. Created in 1955 by [[Jim Henson]], they are the namesake for the [[The Walt Disney Company|Walt Disney Company]] [[media franchise]] that encompasses films, television series, music recordings, print publications, and other media associated with ''[[The Muppet Show]]'' characters.  

The Muppets were created in the 1950s, heralded by the conception of [[Kermit the Frog]], who would retrospectively become [[Jim Henson]]'s signature character. Jim Henson said the word "Muppet" predated ''[[Sam and Friends]]'', the first television program featuring the Muppets. Often times, Henson would tell people the term had been created by combining the words "[[marionette]]" and "[[puppet]]", but also claimed that it was actually a word he had coined.<ref>{{cite interview |first=Jim |last=Henson |subjectlink=Jim Henson |interviewer=Judy Harris |url=http://www.muppetcentral.com/articles/interviews/jim1.shtml |date=September 21, 1998 |accessdate=December 30, 2011 |quote=It was really just a term we made up. For a long time I would tell people it was a combination of marionettes and puppets but, basically, it was really just a word that we coined. We have done very few things connected with marionettes.}}</ref> During the 1960s, the characters (notably Kermit and [[Rowlf the Dog]]) appeared on skits in several late night talk shows and advertising commercials. After the debut of ''[[Sesame Street]]'' in 1969 (for which Henson designed and performed several characters for), Henson decided to pursue the creation of a television program that would be aimed towards adults and children. By 1976, ''[[The Muppet Show]]'', a [[Sketch comedy|sketch comedy]] [[Variety show|variety]] series debuted, introducing new characters such as [[Miss Piggy]], [[Fozzie Bear]], [[The Great Gonzo]] and [[Animal (Muppet)|Animal]], as well as showcasing Muppet regulars; Kermit the Frog and Rowlf the Dog. ''The Muppet Show'' became increasingly popular due to its unique brand of humor and prolific roster of guest stars. The show's success allowed [[The Jim Henson Company|Henson Associates]] to produce three theatrical features based on the group; ''[[The Muppet Movie]]'', ''[[The Great Muppet Caper]]'' and ''[[The Muppets Take Manhattan]]'' that followed in 1979, 1981 and 1983, respectively. 

By the late 1980s, Jim Henson entered discussions with [[The Walt Disney Company]], in which the latter would acquire [[Jim Henson Productions]] and in turn, own ''The Muppets'' franchise.<ref name="Disney2004Press">{{cite web|title=The Walt Disney Company and The Jim Henson Company Sign Agreement for Disney to buy The "Muppets" and "Bear in the Big Blue House"|url=http://corporate.disney.go.com/news/corporate/2004/2004_0217_kermit.html|work=Press release|publisher=[[The Walt Disney Company]]|accessdate=16 January 2013|quote=In the months before his death in 1990, my father Jim Henson pursued extensive discussions with The Walt Disney Company based on his strong belief that Disney would be a perfect home for the Muppets.}}</ref> However, due to Henson's death in 1990, solid negotiations never materialized. Still interested in the franchise, Disney co-produced the fourth and fifth Muppet films; ''[[The Muppet Christmas Carol]]'' and ''[[Muppet Treasure Island]]'', with Jim Henson Productions in 1992 and 1996, respectively. Eventually in 2004, [[The Walt Disney Company]] purchased ''The Muppets'' [[Intellectual property|intellectual properties]], consisting of rights and trademarks to ''The Muppet Show'' and ''[[Bear in the Big Blue House]]'' characters.<ref name="Disney2004Press"/><ref>{{cite web|title=The Walt Disney Company and The Jim Henson Company Sign Agreement for Disney to buy the  <U+201C>Muppets<U+201D> and <U+201C>Bear in the Big Blue House<U+201D>|url=http://www.henson.com/press_releases/2004-02-17.pdf|work=Press release|publisher=[[The Jim Henson Company]]|accessdate=16 January 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4158/is_20040218/ai_n12772234/print|title=Disney buys Muppets as bid prospect fades |work=The Independent  |date=February 18, 2004 |accessdate=December 31, 2011}}{{deadlink|date=November 2012}}</ref> Exceptions included [[List of Sesame Street Muppets|characters]] created specifically for ''[[Sesame Street]]'' (as they were previously sold to [[Sesame Workshop]]) and [[List of Fraggle Rock characters |the Fraggles]] of ''[[Fraggle Rock]]'' (which are still owned by the Jim Henson Company). Although the term "Muppet" is often genericized to refer to any puppet that resembles the distinctive style of ''The Muppet Show'', the term is a legal [[trademark]] owned by Disney in reference to the original characters created by Henson. The trademark is currently held by [[The Muppets Studio]], a wholly owned subsidiary of Disney responsible for managing the Muppet characters, although Sesame Workshop continues to occasionally use the term on their characters with certain permissions from Disney.

Disney underwent an extensive re-branding of the franchise beginning in 2008, in anticipation of the seventh film; [[The Muppets (film)|''The Muppets'']].<ref name="NYFuzzy">{{cite news|last=Barnes|first=Brooks|title=Fuzzy Renaissance|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/21/movies/21barn.html?pagewanted=all|accessdate=29 December 2012|newspaper=The New York Times|date=18 September 2008}}</ref><ref name="WallStreet">{{cite news|last=Jurgensen|first=John|title=A Muppet Makeover|url=http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424053111903596904576514760501039394.html|accessdate=24 July 2012|newspaper=''[[The Wall Street Journal]]''|date=19 August 2011}}</ref> The film, written by [[Jason Segel]] and [[Nicholas Stoller]] and directed by [[James Bobin]], was released by [[Walt Disney Pictures]] on November 23, 2011, and met with critical acclaim and commercial success.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117982291 |title=Segel and Stoller take on Muppets |first=Michael |last=Fleming |work=Variety |date=March 12, 2008 |accessdate=December 31, 2011}}</ref> ''The Muppets'' will be followed by a semi-sequel set for release on March 21, 2014.<ref name="LATimes">{{cite news|last=Fritz|first=Ben|title=Disney cancels 'Little Mermaid 3-D,' dates 'Pirates 5' for 2015|url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/envelope/cotown/la-et-ct-disney-cancels-little-mermaid-3d-pirates-5-2015-20130114,0,6139988.story|accessdate=14 January 2013|newspaper=''[[The Los Angeles Times]]''|date=15 January 2013}}</ref>

==Physical appearance==
A common design for a Muppet is a character with a very wide mouth and large protruding eyes.

The puppets are often molded or carved out of various types of foam, and then covered with fleece, fur, or other felt-like material. Muppets may represent humans, [[Anthropomorphism|anthropomorphic]] animals, realistic animals, robots, anthropomorphic objects, extraterrestrial creatures, mythical beings or other unidentified, newly imagined creatures, monsters, or abstract characters.

Muppets are distinguished from [[Ventriloquism|ventriloquist]] "dummies"/"puppets", which are typically animated only in the head and face, in that their arms or other features are also mobile and expressive. Muppets are typically made of softer materials. They are also presented as being independent of the puppeteer, who is usually not visible<U+2014>hidden behind a set or outside of the camera frame. Using the camera frame as the "stage" was an innovation of the Muppets. Previously on television, there would typically be a stage hiding the performers, as if in a live presentation. Sometimes they are seen full-bodied. This is done by using invisible strings to move the characters' bodies and mouths, and then adding the voices later.<ref>Christopher Finch ''Jim Henson: The Works'' 1993, ISBN 0-679-41203-4.</ref>

Muppets tend to develop, as writer Michael Davis put it, "organically", meaning that the puppeteers take time, often up to a year, slowly developing their characters and voices. Muppets are also, as Davis said, "test-driven, passed around from one Henson troupe member to another in the hope of finding the perfect human-Muppet match".<ref>{{Cite book |last=Davis |first=Michael |title=Street Gang: The Complete History of Sesame Street |publisher=Viking Press |year=2008 |location=New York |page=166 |isbn=978-0-670-01996-0}}</ref>

When interacting with Muppets, children tended to act as though the Muppets were living creatures, even when they could see the puppeteers.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Morrow |first=Robert W. |title= Sesame Street and the Reform of Children's Television |publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press |year=2006 |location= Baltimore, Maryland |page=84 |isbn=0-8018-8230-3}}</ref>

==Operation==
The Muppeteer or Muppet master holds the Muppet above his head or in front of his body, with one hand operating the head and mouth and the other manipulating the hands and arms, either with two separate control rods or by "wearing" the hands like gloves. One consequence of this design is that most Muppets are left-handed as the puppeteer uses his right hand to operate the head while operating the arm rod with his left hand. There are many other common designs and means of operation. In advanced Muppets, several Muppeteers may control a single character; the performer who controls the mouth usually provides the voice for the character. As technology has evolved, the Jim Henson team and other puppeteers have developed an enormous variety of means to operate Muppets for film and television, including the use of suspended rigs, internal motors, remote radio control, and computer enhanced and superimposed images. Creative use of a mix of technologies has allowed for scenes in which Muppets appear to be riding a bicycle, rowing a boat, and even dancing on-stage with no puppeteer in sight.

==Characters==

Famous Muppets from ''[[The Muppet Show]]'' and related spin-offs include [[Kermit the Frog]], [[Miss Piggy]], [[Fozzie Bear]], [[The Great Gonzo]], [[Pepe the King Prawn]], [[Rizzo the Rat]], [[Rowlf the Dog]], Dr. [[Bunsen Honeydew]] and [[Beaker (Muppet)|Beaker]], [[Scooter (Muppet)|Scooter]], [[Johnny Fiama]], [[Clifford (Muppet)|Clifford]], [[Bobo the Bear]], [[Statler and Waldorf]], the [[Swedish Chef]], [[Sal Minella]], [[Sam the Eagle]], [[Sweetums]], [[Robin the Frog]] (Kermit's nephew), [[Walter (Muppet)|Walter]], [[Annie Sue (Muppet)|Annie Sue]], [[Pops (Muppet)|Pops]], [[Lew Zealand]], [[Beauregard (Muppet)|Beauregard]], and the band [[Dr. Teeth and The Electric Mayhem]] featuring [[Dr. Teeth and The Electric Mayhem#Dr. Teeth|Dr. Teeth]] on keyboard, [[Animal (Muppet)|Animal]] on the drums, [[Sgt. Floyd Pepper|Floyd]] on bass, and [[Dr. Teeth and The Electric Mayhem#Janice|Janice]] on lead guitar, [[Dr. Teeth and The Electric Mayhem#Zoot|Zoot]] on saxophone, and [[Dr. Teeth and The Electric Mayhem#Lips|Lips]] on trumpet. Other well-known Muppets include ''[[Sesame Street]]'' characters such as [[Big Bird]], [[Oscar the Grouch]], and [[Elmo]], and the main characters of ''[[Fraggle Rock]]''.

Television shows featuring Muppets have been ''[[The Jimmy Dean Show]]'', ''[[Sesame Street]]'', ''[[The Muppet Show]]'', ''[[Fraggle Rock]]'' and ''[[Bear in the Big Blue House]]''. Other series have included ''[[The Jim Henson Hour]]'', ''[[The Ghost of Faffner Hall]]'', ''[[Dog City]]'', ''[[Secret Life of Toys]]'', ''[[Muppets Tonight]]'', ''[[The Wubbulous World of Dr. Seuss]]'' and ''[[Statler and Waldorf: From the Balcony]]''. A recurring adult-oriented cast of Muppets (in a setting known as [[Saturday Night Live (season 1)|The Land of Gorch]]) were featured throughout the first season of ''[[Saturday Night Live]]''.

Guest stars on some of these programs have occasionally had Muppet versions of themselves. It was a regular practice for the first few episodes of ''The Muppet Show'', and [[ZZ Top]], among others, have appeared as Muppet versions of themselves on ''Sesame Street''. Muppet versions of real people have also appeared in other shows, such as in ''[[30 Rock]]'', when one of the characters, [[Kenneth Parcell]], views his co-workers as Muppet-versions in episode "Apollo, Apollo" of March 26, 2009.

The puppet characters of ''[[Farscape]]'', ''[[The Storyteller]]'', ''Mother Goose Stories'', ''[[The Hoobs]]'', ''[[Construction Site]]'' and ''[[Dinosaurs (TV series)|Dinosaurs]]'', as well as from the films ''[[Labyrinth (film)|Labyrinth]]'', ''[[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (film)|Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles]]'', ''[[Buddy (1997 film)|Buddy]]'', ''[[The Country Bears]]'' and ''[[The Dark Crystal]]'', are not considered Muppets,<ref>{{cite journal |author=Judy Harris|date=9/21/82|title=Jim Henson's Muppets|journal=Cinefantastique|url=http://users.bestweb.net/~foosie/henson.htm|accessdate=February 14, 2012}}</ref> as they were made by [[Jim Henson's Creature Shop]], rather than by Henson's Muppet Workshop. The puppet casts of ''[[Puppet Up!]]'' and ''Tinseltown'' are also not considered Muppets as they were made by The Jim Henson Company after the sale of The Muppets in 2004. The ''[[Star Wars]]'' character [[Yoda]] was voiced by [[Frank Oz]], one of Henson's regular performers, and is often referred to as a Muppet in media and reference works; he is not, however, a Muppet and Henson's organization was not involved in the character's design.<ref>{{cite news|last=Hauptfuhrer|first=Fred|title=Yoda Mania: America Falls in Love with the 26<U+2013>Inch, Green, Pointy-Eared Sage and his Master Puppeteer, Frank Oz|url=http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20076674,00.html|accessdate=17 December 2012|newspaper=[[People (magazine)|''People'']]|date=9 June 1980}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Plume|first=Kenneth|title=Interview with Frank Oz (Part 2 of 4)|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2000/02/10/interview-with-frank-oz-part-2-of-4|publisher=IGN|accessdate=17 December 2012}}</ref>

==Discography==
{{main|The Muppets discography}}
On September 17, 2002, [[Rhino Entertainment|Rhino Records]] released ''[[The Muppet Show: Music, Mayhem, and More]]'', a compilation album of music from ''The Muppet Show'' and subsequent film outings.

Under Disney ownership, albums featuring "The Muppets" characters, have since been released by [[Walt Disney Records]], including ''[[The Muppets' Wizard of Oz (soundtrack)|Best of the Muppets: The Muppets' Wizard of Oz]]'' (2005), ''[[The Muppets: A Green and Red Christmas]]'' (2006) and ''[[Muppets: The Green Album]]'' (2011), and ''[[The Muppets (soundtrack)|The Muppets: Original Soundtrack]]'' (2011). Legal rights to Muppet-related songs such as "[[Rainbow Connection]]" and the "[[The Muppet Show Theme]]", are controlled by Fuzzy Muppet Songs and Mad Muppet Melodies, divisions of [[Disney Music Group|Disney Music Publishing]].

==Other media==
===Comic books===
Since the late 1970s, numerous Muppet-related comic books have been released over the years. The first [[comic strip]]s based on The Muppets appeared on September 21, 1981 in over 500 daily newspapers, just months after ''[[The Muppet Show]]'' ended its five year run. ''The Muppets Comic Strip'' was printed daily from 1981 to 1986. By the end of its initial run, the comic strip was seen in over 660 newspapers worldwide. Special strips were also created in color, exclusively for issues of ''Muppet Magazine''.

The only film in the franchise to see a comic book adaptation was ''[[The Muppets Take Manhattan]]''. The [[The Muppets Take Manhattan#Marketing|comic book series]] was adapted by Marvel Comics in 1984, as the 68 page story in Marvel Super Special No. 32, August. The adaptation was later re-printed into three limited series issues, released under Marvel's [[Star Comics]] imprint (November 1984 <U+2013> January 1985).

In the wake of the success of the ''[[Muppet Babies]]'' television show, Star Comics began releasing the [[Muppet Babies#Comics|Muppet Babies comic book]] title on a bi-monthly basis. These were original stories, not adaptations of the show's episodes.

In the final ''[[Disney Adventures]]'' issue, with a cover date of November 2007, a one-page story single strip focusing on Fozzie Bear, Smedley, Statler, and Waldorf (with a cameo by Scooter) was released. [[Roger Langridge]] wrote and drew the comics intending it to be more long running.

In 2009, [[Boom! Studios]] began publishing ''[[The Muppet Show (comics)|The Muppet Show Comic Book]]'' based on the eponymous television show and written and drawn by [[Roger Langridge]]. Additionally, BOOM! Studios also began publishing Muppet fairy-tale comic adaptations similar to ''[[The Muppet Christmas Carol]]'' and ''[[Muppet Treasure Island]]''. In 2011, [[Marvel Comics]] became the series' publisher.<ref>{{cite web|title=Marvel and Disney Publishing Worldwide launch Disney<U+2022>Muppets Presents giant-sized comic|url=http://marvel.com/news/story/15605/meet_the_muppets#ixzz2GI131p6x|url=http://marvel.com/news/story/15605/meet_the_muppets|publisher=[[Marvel Comics]]|accessdate=27 December 2012}}</ref>

===Sing-alongs===
During the 1990s, four Muppet [[sing-along]]s were released by Jim Henson Video. They featured brand new material as well as music videos cut from previous shows and films. The first sing-along, ''Billy Bunny's Animal Songs'', was notable at the time for being the first video release featuring [[Steve Whitmire]] performing Kermit. It was also the first production filmed after Jim Henson's death in 1990 and was immediately followed by production on ''The Muppets Celebrate Jim Henson''.

* ''Muppet Sing-Alongs: Billy Bunny's Animal Songs'' (1993)
* ''Muppet Sing-Alongs: It's Not Easy Being Green'' (1994)
* ''Muppet Sing-Alongs: Muppet Treasure Island'' (1996)
* ''Muppet Sing-Alongs: Things That Fly'' (1996)

===Interactive books===
During the 1980s, several [[book-and-record set]]s were produced featuring characters from ''The Muppet Show'' and ''Muppet Babies''. In addition, several interactive [[Playskool]] [[Talk 'n Play]]s based on the Muppets were produced including ''The Muppets: Opening Day at Peppermint Park''.

===Theme parks===
{{Main|Muppet*Vision 3D}}
''The Muppet Show'' characters have been making worldwide appearances at [[Walt Disney Parks and Resorts|Disney theme parks]] and the [[Disney Cruise Line]] since their first attraction, [[Muppet*Vision 3D]], opened on May 16, 1991, at [[Disney's Hollywood Studios]] (known then as Disney-MGM Studios), part of the [[Walt Disney World|Walt Disney World Resort]]. Notable for being the final Muppets project to be produced by [[Jim Henson]], the attraction had a subsequent opening on February 8, 2001, at [[Disney California Adventure|Disney California Adventure Park]], part of the [[Disneyland Resort]]. Directed by Henson and written by [[Bill Prady]], the show is a [[3D film]] featuring the Muppets in a plot similar to what was seen on ''The Muppet Show''.

[[Walt Disney Imagineering]] designed a free-roving, [[Audio-Animatronics|audio-animatronic]] that was later tested at Disney California Adventure Park and at [[Epcot]] at [[Walt Disney World]]. It is currently deployed at [[Hong Kong Disneyland]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.themeit.com/thea_15annual/articles/Disney.pdf|title=The Themed Entertainment Association<U+2019>s 15th Thea Awards <U+2013> Delightfully Disney <U+2013> Muppet Mobile Lab Profile|publisher=Themed Entertainment Association|accessdate=September 30, 2009}}</ref>

==In popular culture==
Muppet-like and Muppet-inspired puppets star in the 2004 [[Tony Award]]-winning Broadway musical ''[[Avenue Q]]'' (which disavows any relationship with Sesame Workshop or the Jim Henson Company, possibly to avoid lawsuits from the two companies). [[Peter Jackson]]'s film, ''[[Meet the Feebles]]'' is another parody of the Muppets. A vomit-spewing Kermit the Frog was a recurring character on ''[[Late Night with Conan O'Brien]]'', and the Muppets were frequently "pre-empted" at the beginning of episodes for the Canadian series ''[[You Can't Do That on Television]].'' Seth Green's short-lived show ''[[Greg the Bunny]]'' was about sentient hand-puppets working in a Muppet-like children's show. Many other movies and television shows such as ''[[The Simpsons]]'', ''[[Family Guy]]'', ''[[The West Wing]]'' and ''[[Robot Chicken]]'' have referenced The Muppets<U+2014>for a more comprehensive list, see [[wikiasite:muppet:Category:References|Muppet Wiki]].
