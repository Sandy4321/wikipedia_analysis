This article is a '''list of fictional characters''' from the '''[[Sakura Wars]]''' series.

The names of the various troupes/divisions of the ''Teikoku Kagekidan'' (e.g., flower, star, moon,  wind) are modeled on those of the ''Takarazuka Kagekidan'' ([[Takarazuka Revue]]). [http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/anime.php?id=216&page=22]  Similarly, the names of the troupe members are often patterned on the name of the troupe&mdash;flowers in the Hanagumi and the ''Groupe Fleur de Paris'', celestial bodies in the Hoshigumi (the New York ''Kagekidan'' also uses celestial bodies).  The naming patterns are likely the work of [[Satoru Akahori]], the scenario writer for the games [http://www.ex.org/2.4/40-sakura_taisen.html], who uses such throughout most of his creations (e.g., in ''[[Sorcerer Hunters]]'' and ''[[Saber Marionette J]]'').

{{nihongo|'''Sakura Shinguji'''|<U+771F><U+5BAE><U+5BFA> <U+3055><U+304F><U+3089>|Shinguji Sakura}}
Born in [[Sendai, Miyagi|Sendai]], [[Miyagi Prefecture|Miyagi]], Japan on [[1905]]-[[07-28]], Sakura is a master of Hokushin Itto Ryu [[Kenjutsu]]. As the daughter of Kazuma Shinguji, the hero of the last demon war, and heir to the spiritual power of the Shinguji family, she was summoned to Tokyo by General Yoneda sometime after the formation of the Hanagumi. Struggling to adapt to life in the metropolis after arriving from rural Sendai, she is further troubled by trying to integrate with the already established members of the Flower Division. 

Often seen as either clumsy or a country yokel by many of the other members when she first arrives, she steadily increases in skill and confidence to become one of the strongest of the group. Other than her open and friendly personality, the main benefits she brings to the group are the Shinguji family's hereditary power to drive away evil and the spiritual sword ''[[Tachi|Arataka]]''. She pilots the Nishiki Unit K<U+014D>bu. {{-}}

:Theme songs: "Nayamashi Mambo" ("Seductive Mambo") and "Zettai Unmei no Tango" ("Tango of Absolute Destiny")
An established actress of great talent and self-professed star of the Hanagumi, Sumire is arrogant and conceited, perhaps because she was raised as a spoiled brat, with her father and grandfather being good-hearted yet very workaholic.  Despite her attitude, she is skilled pilot and highly capable of wielding a [[naginata]], and can sometimes be rather wise. She is a daughter born into the elite Kanzaki industrial clan, whose factory produced the Koubu.

:Theme songs: "Only Man" and "Ikiteru Yorokobi" ("Alive with Joy")

A veteran of the [[Russian Revolution of 1917|Russian Revolution]], Maria is the only member of the Hanagumi with prior experience of military tactics and warfare. This experience was why she was chosen to be the original leader of the group. However, though her struggles in Russia had left her an expert marksman and skilled tactician, she also became coldly logical and unwilling to interact with others on an emotional level, which led to being labeled "Kazuar" (meaning "phoenix" in Russian). After a series of set backs, it was decided that Ichiro <U+014C>gami should replace her as leader, with Maria remaining as his second. After an initial period of friction between the pair when <U+014C>gami arrived, Maria's attitude began to turn slightly, though she still remains the most coldly emotional of the group. Sakura looks up at Maria very much at the beginning.

:Theme songs: "Etude" and "Itoshi no Jean-Paul" ("Beloved Jean-Paul")

Born into an aristocratic family somewhere in France (in the state of Champagne), Iris always wears a green gown with white apron and pink ribbon on her hair and carries her teddy bear Jean Paul around with her. Her Kobu is in yellow colour.  The youngest member of the Hanagumi, Iris does not use a weapon like her teammates, but she has psionic Energy Amplifying powers.  She can heal her teammates with her ''Marionette'' ability.  Because of this, she is the core of the ''Haja no Jin'' spiritual barricade formation.  She is also capable of teleportation.  She says that when she is 20 years old, she will marry <U+014C>gami. Her parents apparently kept her locked in her room for a long time, scared by her psychic abilities, until Ayame came up to them and offered to take Iris to Japan.

Hiroi Ouji's claims the character is named after K<U+014D>ran, ''a cousin'' in China, but he is known to jest. [http://jeank.fc2web.com/SS/report/001-roseanddandyism.html]  The Japanese producers use "Ri Kohran" in various productions of the show. In vol. 2 of the manga, [[Tokyopop]] uses "Li Kohran" as the romanization.  Kohran's cousin from China also appears in the series. She appears in the ''Sakura Taisen Hanasaku'' Musical as the teacher of the Otomegumi.  Her name is written {{nihongo|Hakuran Ri|<U+674E> <U+767D><U+862D>|[[Japanese language|Japanese]]: Ri Hakuran, [[Chinese language|Chinese]] [[Pinyin]]: ''L<U+01D0> B<U+00E1>il<U+00E1>n''}} The name is a pun on Kohran's, changing the character for "crimson" to the character for "white".</ref>

Cheerful, and good humoured, Kohran is mechanically inclined and loves to work with the kobu.  She works as the stage manager of the Hanagumi.  A running joke in the series is that Kohran's inventions are rather accident-prone, often backfiring or blowing up in her face. She sometimes uses Ogami to test her inventions, with predictably hilarious results. Despite her cheerful attitude, she also has a serious side regarding her past; a bandit raid killed her parents and was said to be the only survivor during the village fire. She idolizes the creator of the Kobu... but does not know that he's with the enemy.

Always hungry and tomboyish, the fairly easygoing Kanna serves as the group's raw muscle. Kanna is the master of a Martial Arts style that allows her to easily kill a bull with her bare hands.  She sometimes gets into an argument with Sumire over their differences in attitude.

:Theme song: "Moshimo..." ("If...")
An extremely beautiful Italian-Japanese girl, Orihime was at first cordial to all of her fellow teammates<U+2014>except for <U+014C>gami. The reason she holds a grudge against Oogami is because her Japanese father, Seiya Ogata, abandoned her; after that, she despised all Japanese men, thinking them unreliable. However, <U+014C>gami managed to eventually reunite her with Ogata, with whom she made peace, and Orihime and <U+014C>gami become close friends.

:Theme song: "Icarus no Hoshi" ("Star of Icarus")
As a young child in Germany, Leni was part of a program that created high spirit power children called "wunderkind" (translated from German as "Miracle Child").  Because of that project, Leni is so distant and tomboyish that everyone initially thought she was a boy. With Oogami and everyone elses support however, she becomes more open, and gets along well with Iris.  
Mentioned in the ADV Sakura Wars TV pamphlet Leni has great battlefield tactic knowledge and is a gifted ballerina. It is possible that she is named after Leni Riefenstahl, a German filmmaker whose most famous work was "Triumph of the Will".

===Kazegumi===
The ''Kazegumi'' ("Wind Division") is the support unit for the Hanagumi. The members assist in the running of the Imperial Theater, and act as [[Bridge Crew|bridge bunnies]] during combat operations, also piloting the "Shougei-Maru" airship and "Gourai-Gou" high-speed underground transport train.

:Blood Type: A

Graduating from the same naval academy as Ichiro <U+014C>gami at the same time, Kayama was intended as the original replacement for Maria as leader of the Hanagumi. However, after it was found that his above average spiritual power was still not enough to power a K<U+014D>bu, General Yoneda found a different use for him. Given command of the Tsukigumi, or "Moon Division" (the [[reconnaissance]] and [[military intelligence|intelligence]] unit for the Hanagumi), Kayama's role is to carry out any and all covert missions for the general. As part of his duties he is often seen in disguise, whilst discreetly passing on information to Yoneda. He has some limited psychic abilities, including being able to induce hallucinations in others.

===Yumegumi===
The Yumegumi (lit.: Dream Division) is a group of women who have strong psychic abilities who provide psychic reinforcement from afar to the Teito Kagekidan when they're in battle. Another function of the Yumegumi is to perform psychic research on recovered artifacts, though this can occasionally trigger a brutal response from their enemies. They never appeared in the games, but they do appear in the film and television anime.

=== Baragumi ===
The Baragumi (Lit: Rose Division) are the self styled "Evil Spirit Defense Forces" and the self-styled "Secret Corps of Love and Beauty."  The members are all [[Homosexuality in Japan|okama]].  The Baragumi are attached to the army and live in the basement of the Imperial Theatre where the shows are held. Kotone and Kikunoj<U+014D> have a more prominent role in the stage version of the show.  They often feature in the plot, have their own songs and dance numbers, and in later shows participate in the "play-within-a-play" as secondary actors.

:Theme Song: "Inori" ("Prayer")

A sixteen-year old nun in training, and a cabaret dancer for Chattes Noires at night. A devout Christian, who genuinely wants to help people in need, however, because of her clumsy nature, those whom receive her help often ends up with more trouble. She sometimes mistakes her dreams and imagination as reality, and acts on it, creating havoc. In the game, she frequently walks in to a billboard, hitting her head. Once, during the game, when her true spiritual powers awaken, she takes on a serious, divine personality.

She has a great interest in Japan and its culture, although her knowledge is often anachronistic, or wrong. She asks Ogami about Japan many times in the game. Her favorite food is pudding. Her hobbies are: bible reading, prayer, helping people, and machine gun shooting. She carries two cross-shaped machine guns named "Raphael" and "Gabrielle", concealed inside her skirt. 

When she was young, her parents died in an accident, in which she survived by accidentally using her special powers. Afraid that people who've seen her powers will think ill of her, she decides to live and become a nun in a church ran by Father Leno. She genuinely tries to help others in need, yet her clumsiness almost always creates more trouble. For example; when asked by Father Leno to clean the sanctuary, she ends up destroying the Virgin Mary statue, when she was in charge of clearing the weed near the church, she ends up plucking out the flower bed, and when she was in charge of the cooking, and she cooked up a dish that was uneatable. Because of such action, she was actually asked to leave the convent but due to her misunderstanding and impression of Leno's saying, she stayed there for six more months.

In ''Sakura Taisen: Ecole De Paris'', Grand Mere first met her in a church seeing her praying with angel wings and she became the first Paris Hanagumi. But after a year training, she still slacks much to Grand Mere's dismay. She makes friends with Glycine and recruits Glycine as the second member, after saving her. It is also shown that she gets her infamous wake-up maracas dance from Father Leno. When Erica is arrested as an accomplice of Lobelia due to Lobelia's lie, Erica wonders what Lobelia meant by having pleasure in the morning with men. Father Leno, being at a loss for an answer, tells her that men and women dance in the morning to show gratitude to God.

When Ogami came to Paris, she was the first member to meet him during a commotion in the European exposition ground. In the chapter where the Teito members (Maria, Kanna and Kohran) came to Paris as coaches to coach the Paris Hanagumi, she failed all the drills. However, the coaches felt that her spiritual powers have not been awakened. During this chapter, Father Leno comes to Ogami and asks him to tell Erica to leave the convent, due to Erica's clumsiness creating more havoc. Having heard their conversation, compounded by her failure in the drills earlier, she feels she is no longer needed anywhere. With no where to stay or go, she wanders around the raining city until Ogami finds her. She falls sick and ends up staying in Ogami's place, where Ogami notices her enormous spiritual powers. The next day, although she hesitates at first to come back to Chattes Noires, the rest of the Paris Hanagumi manages to convince Erica to come back, by making a fake emergency call. But a few minutes later, a real attack on Chattes Noires occurs. During this attack, her spiritual power awakens when she tries to save her friends from being killed by Corbeau. In the end, Erica is given a room in the attic of Chattes Noires. 

Erica is always seen smiling and trying to cheer up everyone. In ''Sakura Taisen Le Nouvue Paris'', due to the nature of the game ''Sakura Taisen'', a debate occurs amongst the Hanagumi members as to whom the next captain of the Hanagumi should be. At first, each member feels that Ogami chose herself as the next captain, however, in the end Erica is chosen as the Captain of the Paris Hanagumi by the member themselves. Thought she still has her perky and clumsy attitude.

The daughter and sole heir of the Bleumer family, a great noble of Normandy decent. Her personality is aggressive, due to her Viking blood. She is preoccupied as to how a noble should act and contribute to society. She is also extremely proud with talent to back it up, and does not hesitate to hard work to gain such talent. A very responsible and reliable member of the Hanagumi. She is a good friend to Kitaoji Hanabi, who lives in the Bleumer family palace. She loves small animals (revealed in the dating event in Chapter 6), and has humanity to protect the weak. 

Because of her pride as the protector of Paris, both as a noble and a member of the Hanagumi; she, at first, does not think that a foreigner such as Ogami could protect Paris. However, as she sees the genuine nature in Ogami, she starts to respect Ogami as the captain of the Hanagumi.

There is a "Bridegroom Test" for the Bluemer Family, which requires excellent intelligence, battle skills, and blood line, to be accepted as the "Complete and Perfect" bridegroom for Glycine. Ogami passed the test.

Due to what appeared to Glycine as a lack of pride in Ogami, she had an argument with him and eventually a duel. Ogami loses (Since he was worried of attacking her when she lost her balance) and becomes a temporary maid for the Bleumer family. Later, she was proposed to another noble named Count Richie. But Ogami manages to expose his true identity by challenging him to a duel and winning. Watching the duel, she thinks that Ogami lost to her on purpose. In the end, she respects Ogami after another argument with him and finds out the true meaning of nobility.

She has a personal head maid named Tarebou and always sneaks out the house with multiple excuses while she works in Chattes Noires as "Blue Eyes" to conceal her identity. In the game, Ogami is asked to help her get out of a Bleumer traditional event, where octopus, which she hates, is served. According to Grand Mere, if they used her real name, the Bleumer family will come storming in to Chattes Noires for making their only daughter a cabaret dancer.

:Theme Song: "1924556331"

A thief, who was sentenced to one thousand years of confinement for her numerous crimes. Because eighty percent of the criminal incident in Paris was her doing, she was called the greatest villain in Paris. She has a tendency to use any means to achieve her goal: she used her spiritual powers to commit her crimes, and burned a famous painting when the enemy tried to use it as a bargaining chip. Born between a Romanian father and an Italian mother. 

When the Paris Hanagumi members are captured and detained in the prison, where she was also detained, to recruit her, she took Erica as hostage. However, because of Erica's comical yet sincere approach, she was confused and captured off guard. Even though Erica was taken hostage by her, Erica healed her wounds, much to her surprise. 

The only anti-hero throughout the three Hanagumi, she joined the Paris Hanagumi under the condition that her sentence would be reduced and a huge reward would be given with each dispatch (on the other hand, if she refused to join, Grand Mere had the right to do as she pleased, even to kill her).

She hesitates to intimate interaction with people, and often acts cold, selfish and irresponsible, in order to keep people from becoming close to her. However, to Erica, those actions had no effect. Because Erica keeps approaching her as a normal person worthy of attention, and because she cannot stop Erica from doing so, she has a hard time dealing with Erica. Even so, she does care for Erica. In Chapter 7 of the game, she baked a birthday cake for Erica, and in Chapter 8, contrary to her words, she searches for Erica.

''Sakura Taisen: Ecole De Paris'' shows how Lobelia and Erica first met; Lobelia, while being chased by the police bumped into Erica causing her to fall into a pile of trash. It also shows how she was captured before being recruited. After the attempt by Grand Mere to capture her failed, Norimichi Sakomizu shoots a spiritual bullet through her heart. Because of her powers, she was only temporary paralyzed. After refusing an offer by Ogami, she was finally recruited by Grand Mere.

She dances a gypsy dance, under the name "Saphir" at Chattes Noires. Her dancing is very good, making detective Evian a fan. She likes gambling and has extensive knowledge of whiskey and wine.

She uses a chain connected to her right arm as a whip, and also can conjure flame with her spiritual power. Her spiritual armor is equipped with a huge claw.

:Theme Song: "Kokoro no Kasawa" ("Umbrella of the Heart")

A very quiet and shy girl who came to Paris for her studies. Because the House of Kitaoji and the House of Bleumer are old acquaintance, the Bleumer family took care of her after her father Baron Kitaoji Masamichi left Paris. She is good friends with Glycine since boarding school.

Because she has lived most of her life in France, she has a strong interest in Japan. She is well versed in Japanese manners and arts, however, her knowledge although accurate, is mostly based on purely formal traditional manners gathered from books. Because of this, in comparison with the Teito Hanagumi members, she is the closest to the typical image of the traditional Japanese woman (reserved, refined, and obedient to men). She dances at Chattes Noires as "Tatamize Jeune"(roughly meaning a traditional "Japanese girl" in French).

She has aquaphobia, because of the trauma of losing her fianc<U+00E9> Philippe de Maleblanche, in a ship wreck, on her wedding day. She wears a black dress as a mourning dress. She frequently visits Philippe's grave. 

In ''Sakura Taisen: Le Nouveau Paris'', Masamichi Kitaoji, Hanabi's father, came to Paris for a surprise visit. During a mission as the Paris Hanagumi, she and Coquelicot encounter him in front of Phillpe's grave. Although usually calm and composed, in trying to keep her involvement with the Paris Kagekidan a secret, she panics and starts finishing her father's sentence. In the game, while teaching  Ogami Japanese Calligraphy, when Ogami spills ink on his shirt, she starts taking off his shirt to prevent the stain, until she realized what she was doing.

A Vietnam Orphan who was raised up as a young magician in a circus. She works and lives with a circus named "Circus De Europe". She was always seen collecting leftovers in the town market and treating the circus animals as her friends. Even though she was treated badly by the ringmaster and always seen smiling all the time, yet she is actually trying to hide her sad feelings of loneness. During the first encounter with Ogami, she first calls him "Oji-san"(which in Japanese means "Old man") yet later she calls him Ichiro all the time. After Ogami notice her background in the circus, he felt pity of her.

Soon, a new performer named Karuchera joins in the circus. She heard her stories of her losing her daughter, assuming that both are in the same boat, she decides to call her "Mama". The truth is that Karuchera is actually Python in her human form (see her profile). Luckily, Ogami and Erica reveals her true identity and she manage to chase her away when Python taken her as hostage. As she used up all her powers and brought back to Chattes Noires, Grand Mere intends to take her as a member of the Hanagumi but Ogami tells Grand Mere to let her decide since she has a sorrowful background, not knowing that she was already awake. In the end, she becomes a member of the Paris Hanagumi. After the Paris Hanagumi defeats Python, she works as the ringmaster (after the original Ringmaster died by Python)in the morning and as a magician in Chattes Noires. Like Erica, she does not use any stage name to cover her identity.

In ''Sakura Taisen: Le Noveue Paris'', she assume that she and Hanabi does not have any parents until Kitaoji Masamichi, Hanabi's father came during their turn for a lookout for the grave robber. She even saves everyone from getting suspected by Masamichi by telling him that Hanabi , her and the rest of the gang are working in the circus since Kagekidan can either mean "Assault Force" or "Entertainment Troupe", after Erica accidentally spills out their true identity. But during Hanabi's performance, Evian spills out their working place, Chattes Noires, and Masamichi volunteer to get onto the stage. Assuming that he'll take her back, she tells him that she'll not let her take her back to Japan and a few parental speech. But it turns out otherwise as he is actually wants to see her smile.

** Lobelia however does not fall into any of the categories; she marks the first anti-hero in all three troupes, having a propensity for theft and gambling. She interrupts rudely in an intro call, burns a famous painting named [[Mona Lisa|"Mosa Lina"]] (which is confirmed to be a fake hanging in the museum) and was forced to make her first victory pose.
