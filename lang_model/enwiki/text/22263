'''Colthurst's Bridge''' is situated {{convert|2.9|km|mi|abbr=on}} north of [[Coachford]] village, {{convert|3.7|km|mi|abbr=on}} east of [[Aghabullogue]] village, and is depicted on both the 1841 and 1901 surveyed OS maps. The bridge is located at the meeting point of the [[townlands]] of Carrignamuck, Clonmoyle East and Peake, the [[Civil parishes in Ireland|civil parish]]es of Aghabullogue and Magourney, and lies within the catholic [[parish]] of Aghabullogue.  

The Ordnance Survey name book (''c''. 1840), refers to it as a bridge with four arches over the Delehinagh River, and named Coulthurst's Bridge, as it was 12 chains ({{convert|0.24|km|mi|abbr=on}}) south-west of Mr Coulthurst's property. The Delehinagh River meets with the Dripsey River a short distance to the right of the bridge. 

The Archaeological Inventory of County Cork describes it as a road bridge with three arches, varying in shape and width, but generally semicircular. The bridge was said to possess dressed sandstone [[voussoir]]s, corbels on its piers which supported arch-centring during construction, and low pointed breakwaters on its upstream side.<ref>{{cite book|first=compiled by Denis Power et al.|title=Archaeological inventory of county Cork, volume 3|date=1997|publisher=Stationery Office|location=Dublin|isbn=}}</ref> Pointed arches were an important feature of later Gothic Revival architecture, and said to be also present at Colthurst's Bridge.<ref>{{cite book|title=Heritage Bridges of County Cork|date=2013|publisher=Heritage Unit of Cork County Council|location=Cork}}</ref> 

Many surviving bridges in mid-Cork are originally constructed of stone, arched in shape, and late eighteenth or early nineteenth century in date. Typical features include semi-circular arches and pointed breakwaters. Earlier bridges are often narrower, although some were widened at a later stage.<ref>{{cite news|title=Ibid.}}</ref>
