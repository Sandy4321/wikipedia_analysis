'''Tirpitz''' was a [[pig]] captured from the [[Kaiserliche Marine|German Navy]] after a naval skirmish following the [[Battle of the Falkland Islands]] in 1914. He subsequently became the mascot of the [[cruiser]] [[HMS Glasgow (1909)|HMS ''Glasgow'']].

== Early life ==
[[File:SMS Dresden German Cruiser LOC 16727.jpg|thumb|right|Tirpitz's first home, SMS ''Dresden'']]
Pigs were often kept on board warships to supply fresh meat. Tirpitz was aboard [[SMS Dresden (1907)|SMS ''Dresden'']] when she was ordered into the South Atlantic to join with the forces of [[Maximilian von Spee|Vice Admiral Maximilian von Spee]] to begin raiding allied merchants. The ship's first encounter with the [[HMS Glasgow (1909)|''Glasgow'']] was at the [[Battle of Coronel]], where the German fleet was victorious. They were subsequently defeated at the [[Battle of the Falkland Islands]], though the faster ''Dresden'' managed to escape. She was located in Cumberland Bay on the [[Chile]]an island of M<U+00E1>s a Tierra (today known as [[Robinson Crusoe Island]]), by HMS ''Glasgow'' and [[HMS Kent (1901)|HMS ''Kent'']] off the coast of South America on 15 March 1915. The Germans scuttled the ship, but Tirpitz was left on board as she sank.

Tirpitz was able to make his way above deck and swim clear of the sinking ''Dresden''. He struck out for the nearby [[Royal Navy]] ships and was spotted an hour later by a petty officer aboard HMS ''Glasgow''. The officer entered the water, but the frightened Tirpitz nearly drowned him. He was however eventually able to rescue the pig and bring him aboard. 'Tirpitz' was subsequently adopted by the crew of HMS ''Glasgow'', who made him their mascot, and named him 'Tirpitz', after [[Alfred von Tirpitz]], the German [[Admiral]], and Secretary of State of the Imperial Naval Office. Tirpitz remained with the ''Glasgow'' for a year and was then placed in quarantine until he was allowed to be adopted by the Petty Officer who had first seen him, who transferred him to [[HMS Excellent (shore establishment)|Whale Island Gunnery School]], [[Portsmouth]] for the rest of his career.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://archive.iwm.org.uk/upload/package/74/AnimalsWar/images/AAW_CAPTIONS.pdf |title=Animals at War exhibition captions |author=Imperial War Museum |date=3 August 2006|work=archive.iwm.org.uk |publisher= |accessdate=8 December 2011}}</ref> ''[[The Times]]'' newspaper reported:

<blockquote>'The animal, which is known as 'Tirpitz', was once owned by the German light cruiser ''Dresden'', and when, during the action with ''Glasgow'', ''Kent'', and ''Orama'', the Germans escaped to the shore after causing an explosion which sank the ''Dresden'', and 'Tirpitz' was left to its fate, the pig struck out boldly, and was seen swimming near the ''Glasgow''. Two sailors dived into the sea, and the animal was brought safely aboard. The ship's company of the ''Glasgow'' awarded 'Tirpitz' an 'Iron Cross' for having remained in the ship after its shipmates had left, and it became a great pet.'<ref>{{Cite newspaper |newspaper=The Times |date=5 December 1917 |page=8 |title=A Dresden survivor}}</ref>

== As a fundraiser ==
Tirpitz was eventually auctioned off for charity as pork in 1919. He ultimately raised [[pound sterling|<U+00A3>]]1,785 for the [[British Red Cross]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://arts.guardian.co.uk/news/story/0,,1819697,00.html |title=Museum honours dogs - and ferrets - of war |author=Kennedy, Maev |authorlink=Maev Kennedy |date=13 July 2006 |work=[[The Guardian]] |publisher= |accessdate=11 December 2011}}</ref> Tirpitz was latterly bought by [[William Cavendish-Bentinck, 6th Duke of Portland]], who donated Tirpitz's stuffed head to the [[Imperial War Museum]].<ref name=times8may1920>{{cite newspaper |newspaper=The Times |date=8 May 1920 |title=Imperial War Museum: Opening by the King next month |page=19}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.iwm.org.uk/collections/item/object/30088283 |title=mounted stuffed pig's head, Tirpitz the Pig |author=[[Imperial War Museum]] |date= |work=IWM Collection Search |publisher= |accessdate=15 December 2011}}</ref> Tirpitz's head was put on display as part of the museum's original exhibition at [[The Crystal Palace]] in 1920,<ref name=times8may1920/> and also featured in the  museum's 2006 temporary exhibition 'The Animals' War'.<ref>[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4158/is_20060628/ai_n16501577 The Independent newspaper's review of the Imperial War Museum's exhibition]</ref>
