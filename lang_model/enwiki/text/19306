'''Harry S. Truman''' (May 8, 1884{{spaced ndash}}December 26, 1972) was the [[List of Presidents of the United States|33rd]] [[President of the United States]] (1945<U+2013>1953). The final [[running mate]] of President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] in 1944, Truman succeeded to the presidency on April 12, 1945, when Roosevelt died after months of declining health.  Under Truman, the U.S. successfully concluded [[World War II]]; in the aftermath of the conflict, tensions with the [[Soviet Union]] increased, marking the start of the [[Cold War]].

Truman was born in Missouri, and spent most of his youth on his family's farm.  During [[World War I]], Truman served in combat in France as an artillery officer in his [[Missouri National Guard|National Guard]] unit. After the war, he briefly owned a [[haberdashery]] and joined the Democratic Party [[political machine]] of [[Tom Pendergast]] in [[Kansas City, Missouri]]. He was first elected to public office as a county official, and in 1934 became [[United States Senate|U.S. senator]]. He gained national prominence as head of the wartime [[Truman Committee]], which exposed waste, fraud, and corruption in wartime contracts.

While Germany surrendered a few weeks after Truman assumed the Presidency, the war with Japan was expected to last another year or more. Truman's decision to use [[atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|nuclear weapons against Japan]] led to a speedy end of the war but remains controversial.  His presidency was a turning point in [[Foreign relations of the United States|foreign affairs]], as the nation supported an internationalist foreign policy in conjunction with European allies.  Working closely with Congress, Truman assisted in the founding of the [[United Nations]], issued the [[Truman Doctrine]] to contain communism, and passed the $12 billion [[Marshall Plan]] to rebuild Europe. Wartime alliance with the Soviet Union became peacetime opposition, and the Cold War began. He oversaw the [[Berlin Airlift]] in 1948 and the creation of [[NATO]] in 1949. When communist North Korea invaded South Korea in 1950, he immediately sent in U.S. troops and gained UN approval for the [[Korean War]]. After initial success, the UN forces were thrown back by Chinese intervention and the conflict was stalemated through the final years of Truman's presidency.

Corruption in Truman's administration, which was linked to certain members in the [[United States Cabinet|cabinet]] and senior White House staff, was a central issue in the [[United States presidential election, 1952|1952 presidential campaign]] which [[Adlai Stevenson II|Adlai Stevenson]], Truman's successor as Democratic nominee, lost to Republican [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]]. Popular and scholarly assessments of his presidency were initially negative, but eventually became more positive after his retirement from politics. Truman's [[United States presidential election, 1948|1948 election upset]] for his full term as president is routinely invoked by underdog candidates.

== Early life and career ==

=== Boyhood and farming ===
Harry S. Truman was born on May 8, 1884 in [[Lamar, Missouri]], the oldest child of John Anderson Truman (1851<U+2013>1914) and [[Martha Ellen Young Truman]] (1852<U+2013>1947). His parents chose the name Harry after his mother's brother, Harrison "Harry" Young (1846<U+2013>1916).{{sfn|McCullough|1992|pp=24, 37}} They chose "S" as his middle initial to please both of his grandfathers, Anderson '''S'''hipp Truman and '''S'''olomon Young. The S did not stand for anything, a common practice among the [[Scotch-Irish American|Scots-Irish]].{{sfn|McCullough|1992|p=37}}{{sfn|Truman Library|2012}} A brother, John Vivian (1886<U+2013>1965), was born soon after Harry, followed by one sister, Mary Jane (1889<U+2013>1978).{{sfn|McCullough|1992|pp=27, 37}}

John Truman was a farmer and livestock dealer. The family lived in Lamar until Harry was ten months old, when they moved to a farm near [[Harrisonville, Missouri|Harrisonville]].  The family next moved to [[Belton, Missouri|Belton]], and in 1887 to his grandparents' 600-acre (240-ha) farm in [[Grandview, Missouri|Grandview]].{{sfn|Truman Library, Birth|2012}} When Truman was six, his parents moved to [[Independence, Missouri|Independence]], so he could attend the [[Presbyterian]] Church Sunday School. Truman did not attend a traditional school until he was eight.{{sfn|McCullough|1992|pp=37, 77, 1112}}

As a boy, Truman was interested in music, reading, and history, all encouraged by his mother, with whom he was very close<U+2014>as president, he solicited political as well as personal advice from her.{{sfn|Oshinsky|2004|pp=365<U+2013>380}} He got up at five every morning to practice the piano, which he studied twice a week until he was fifteen.{{sfn|McCullough|1992|p=38}} Truman was a page at the [[1900 Democratic National Convention]] at [[Convention Hall]] in [[Kansas City, Missouri|Kansas City]];{{sfn|Ferrell|1994|p=87}} his father had many friends who were active in the Democratic Party and helped young Harry to gain his first political position.{{sfn|Truman Library|2012aa}}

After graduating from Independence High School (now [[William Chrisman High School]]) in 1901, Truman worked as a timekeeper on the [[Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway|Santa Fe Railroad]], sleeping in [[hobo]] camps near the rail lines.{{sfn|Truman Library, Job|2012}} He then worked at a series of clerical jobs, and was employed briefly in the mailroom of the ''[[Kansas City Star]].'' He returned to the Grandview farm in 1906, where he remained until entering the army in 1917.{{sfn|McCullough|1992|pp=67, 99}} During this period, he courted [[Bess Truman|Bess Wallace]] and proposed to her in 1911. She turned him down. Truman said that before he proposed again, he wanted to be earning more money than a farmer did.{{sfn|McCullough|1992|pp=78<U+2013>79}}

Truman was the last president of the U.S. who did not have a college degree. When his high school friends went off to the state university in 1901, Truman enrolled in Spalding's Commercial College, a Kansas City business school, but only remained a semester. In 1923<U+2013>25 he took night courses towards a law degree at the Kansas City Law School (now the [[University of Missouri<U+2013>Kansas City]] School of Law), but dropped out after losing his government job.{{sfn|Hamby|1995|pp=17<U+2013>18, 135}}

=== World War I ===

[[File:Harry S. Truman WW I.jpg|thumb|alt=Truman in military uniform with shoulder and waist belt with helmet|Truman in uniform ca. 1918]]

Truman had been turned down for appointment to the [[United States Military Academy]] at West Point, which was his childhood dream, because of poor eyesight.{{sfn|Hamby|1995|pp=17<U+2013>18, 135}} He then enlisted in the [[Missouri Army National Guard]] in 1905, serving  until 1911. At his induction, his eyesight had been an unacceptable [[20/20 vision|20/50]] in the right eye and 20/40 in the left.{{sfn|McCullough|1992|p=105}}  The second time he took the test, he passed by secretly memorizing the eye chart.{{sfn|Truman Library, Eye|2012}}

With the onset of American participation in World War I, Truman rejoined the Guard. Before deployment to France, he was sent to [[Camp Doniphan, Oklahoma|Camp Doniphan]], near [[Lawton, Oklahoma]] for training. He ran the camp canteen with [[Edward Jacobson]], a Jewish clothing store clerk also from Kansas City. When he was at [[Fort Sill]], he met Lieutenant James M. Pendergast, nephew of [[Tom Pendergast|Thomas Joseph (Tom) Pendergast]], a Kansas City [[political boss]], a connection that was to have a profound influence on Truman's later life.{{sfn|Truman Library, 129th|2012}}{{sfn|McCullough|1992|pp=105<U+2013>110}}{{sfn|Giangreco|2012}}{{sfn|Truman Library|1962}}

Truman became an officer, and then [[Artillery battery|battery]] commander in an artillery regiment in France. His unit, Battery D, [[129th Field Artillery Regiment (United States)|129th Field Artillery]], 60th Brigade, [[35th Infantry Division (United States)|35th Infantry Division]], was known for its discipline problems.{{sfn|Gilwee|2000}} During a sudden attack by the [[German Empire|Germans]] in the [[Vosges Mountains]], members started to run away; Truman got them to obey orders using profanities that he had "learned while working on the Santa Fe railroad."{{sfn|Gilwee|2000}} Under Captain Truman's command in France, the battery did not lose a single man.{{sfn|Gilwee|2000}} His battery also provided support for [[George S. Patton]]'s tank [[brigade]] during the [[Meuse-Argonne Offensive]].{{sfn|Giangreco|2002}} On November 11, 1918, Truman's artillery unit fired some of the last shots of World War I towards German positions before the armistice took effect at 11&nbsp;am.{{sfn|Truman Library|1918}} The war was a transformative experience that brought out Truman's leadership qualities,{{sfn|Truman Library, Mil|2012}} and his war record made possible his political career in Missouri.{{sfn|Gilwee|2000}}

== Politics ==

=== Jackson County judge ===

[[File:TrumanWedding.PNG|thumb|left|upright|alt=Wedding photo of Truman in gray suit and his wife in hat with white dress holding flowers |The Trumans' wedding day, June 28, 1919]]
At the war's conclusion, Truman was mustered out as a captain; he returned to Independence, and married Bess Wallace on June 28, 1919.{{sfn|Truman Library|1919}} The couple had one child, [[Mary Margaret Truman|Mary Margaret]] (February 17, 1924&nbsp;<U+2013> January 29, 2008).{{sfn|Goldstein|2008}}

Shortly before Truman's marriage, he and Jacobson had opened a haberdashery at 104 West 12th Street in downtown Kansas City. After brief initial success, the store went bankrupt during the [[Post-WWI recession|recession of 1921]].{{sfn|Oshinsky|2004|pp=365<U+2013>380}} Truman did not pay off the last of the debts from that venture until 1934, when he did so with the aid of a supporter.{{sfn|McCullough|1992|pp=63<U+2013>64, 68}} Jacobson and Truman remained close friends, and Jacobson's advice to Truman on [[Zionism]] later played a role in the U.S. government's decision to recognize Israel.{{sfn|Hamby|1995|pp=410<U+2013>412}}  In 1922, with the help of the Kansas City [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] [[political machine|machine]] led by Tom Pendergast, Truman was elected a judge of the County Court of the eastern district of [[Jackson County, Missouri|Jackson County]]<U+2014>an administrative, not judicial, position similar to county commissioners elsewhere.{{sfn|Oshinsky|2004|pp=365<U+2013>380}}

Truman was not re-elected in 1924, losing in a Republican wave led by President [[Calvin Coolidge]].  His two years in the political wilderness selling automobile club memberships convinced him that a public service career was safer for a man approaching middle age who had never been successful in the private sector.{{sfn|Dallek|2008|p=6}}  With the support of the Pendergast machine, Truman in 1926 was elected the [[List of county executives of Jackson County, Missouri|presiding judge]] for the county court, and re-elected in 1930. Truman coordinated the "Ten Year Plan", which transformed Jackson County and the Kansas City skyline with new public works projects, including an extensive series of roads, construction of a new [[Wight and Wight]]-designed County Court building, and the dedication of a series of 12 [[Madonna of the Trail]] monuments honoring pioneer women.{{sfn|Dallek|2008|p=6}}{{sfn|Barr|2004}}

In 1933 Truman was named Missouri's director for the Federal Re-Employment program (part of the [[Civil Works Administration]]) at the request of Postmaster General [[James Farley]].  This was payback to Pendergast for delivering the Kansas City vote to [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] in the [[United States presidential election, 1932|1932 presidential election]]. The appointment confirmed Pendergast's control over federal [[patronage]] jobs in Missouri and marked the zenith of his power. It also created a relationship between Truman and Roosevelt aide [[Harry Hopkins]], and assured Truman's avid support for the New Deal.{{sfn|Savage|1991|p=65}}

=== U.S. Senator ===

[[File:Senate Desk Truman.jpg|thumb|alt=Inside of wooden desk with several names carved into it|Senate desk used by Truman]]

After serving as judge, Truman wanted to run for Governor or Congress, but Pendergast rejected these ideas. Truman thought that he would serve out his career in some well-paying sinecure at the county level.  Instead, after four other men turned him down, Pendergast reluctantly backed Truman as a Democratic candidate for the [[United States Senate election in Missouri, 1934|1934 U.S. Senate election]] for Missouri.{{sfn|United States Senate|2012}} During the Democratic [[primary election|primary]], Truman defeated two congressmen, [[John J. Cochran]] and [[Jacob L. Milligan]], with the solid support of Jackson County, which was crucial to his candidacy, as were the contacts he had made statewide as a county official. Truman then defeated the incumbent Republican, [[Roscoe C. Patterson]], by nearly 20 percentage points.{{sfn|United States Senate|2012}}{{sfn|Dallek|2008|pp=7<U+2013>9}}{{sfn|Missouri Secretary of State|2000}}

Truman assumed office with a reputation as "the senator from Pendergast". Though he gave patronage decisions to Pendergast, Truman always maintained he voted his conscience. He later defended the patronage decisions by saying that by offering a little to the machine, he saved a lot.{{sfn|Missouri Secretary of State|2000}}{{sfn|''Time''|1973-01-08}}  In his first term as a U.S. Senator, Truman spoke out against corporate greed and the dangers of [[Wall Street]] speculators and other moneyed special interests attaining too much influence in national affairs.{{sfn|McCullough|1992|p=232}} He was largely ignored by President Roosevelt, and had difficulty getting calls to the White House returned.{{sfn|Missouri Secretary of State|2000}}{{sfn|McCullough|1992|p=230}}

In [[United States Senate elections, 1940|1940]], both [[United States Attorney]] Maurice Milligan and former governor [[Lloyd Stark]] challenged Truman in the Democratic primary.  Truman was politically weakened by Pendergast's imprisonment for income tax evasion the previous year; the senator had remained loyal, claiming that Republican judges, not the Roosevelt administration, were responsible for the boss's downfall.{{sfn|Dallek|2008|pp=11<U+2013>12}} St. Louis party leader [[Robert E. Hannegan]]'s support of Truman proved crucial; he would later broker the deal that put Truman on the national ticket. In the end, Stark and Milligan split the anti-Pendergast vote in the Senate Democratic primary, and Truman won by 8,000 votes. In the November election, Truman defeated Republican [[Manvel H. Davis]] by 51% to 49%.{{sfn|Hamby|1995|pp=236<U+2013>247}}

Late in 1940, Truman traveled to a number of military bases.  The waste and profiteering he saw led him to use his subcommittee chairmanship in the Committee on Military Affairs to begin investigations into abuses while the nation prepared for war.  A separate committee to conduct a formal investigation was set up under Truman; the Roosevelt administration supported this plan rather than weather a more hostile probe by the House of Representatives.  Chairmanship of what came to be known as the "[[Truman Committee]]" made him a national figure.{{sfn|Dallek|2008|pp=12<U+2013>14}}  Activities of the Truman Committee ranged from criticizing the "[[dollar-a-year men]]" hired by the government, many of whom proved ineffective, to investigating a shoddily built New Jersey housing project for war workers.{{sfn|''Life''|1942-11-30}} The committee is reported to have saved as much as $15&nbsp;billion;{{sfn|McCullough|1992|pp=337<U+2013>338}}{{sfn|Truman Library, Senate|2012}} its activities put Truman on the cover of ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine.{{sfn|''Time''|2012}}  According to the Senate's historical minutes, in leading the committee, "Truman erased his earlier public image as an errand-runner for Kansas City politicos" and "no senator ever gained greater political benefits from chairing a special investigating committee than did Missouri's Harry S. Truman."{{sfn|Senate Truman Committee|2012}}

== Vice presidency ==

{{see also|The Democratic vice president nomination of 1944}}
[[File:RooseveltTruman1944poster.jpg|240px|thumb|alt=election poster from 1944 with Roosevelt and Truman|Roosevelt/Truman poster from 1944]]

Vice President [[Henry A. Wallace|Henry Wallace]], though popular among Democratic voters, was viewed as too far to the left and too friendly to labor for some of Roosevelt's advisers.  Knowing that Roosevelt might not live out a fourth term, both the President and several of his confidantes moved to replace Wallace.  Outgoing Democratic National Committee chairman [[Frank C. Walker]], incoming chairman Hannegan, party treasurer [[Edwin W. Pauley]], strategist [[Ed Flynn]], [[Mayor of Chicago|Chicago Mayor]] [[Edward Joseph Kelly]] and lobbyist George E. Allen all wanted to keep Wallace off the ticket.{{sfn|McCullough|1992|pp=373<U+2013>378}} Roosevelt told party leaders he would accept either Truman or [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] Justice [[William O. Douglas]]. State and city party leaders strongly preferred Truman, and Roosevelt agreed. Truman himself did not campaign for the Vice-Presidential spot though he welcomed the attention as evidence that he had become more than the "Senator from Pendergast".{{sfn|Dallek|2008|pp=14<U+2013>16}}

Truman's nomination, dubbed the "Second [[Missouri Compromise]]", was well received, and the Roosevelt<U+2013>Truman ticket went on to a 432<U+2013>99 [[United States Electoral College|electoral-vote]] victory in the election, defeating Governor [[Thomas E. Dewey]] of New York and Governor [[John Bricker]] of Ohio. Truman was sworn in as vice president on January 20, 1945.{{sfn|Dallek|2008|pp=15<U+2013>17}}

Truman's brief vice-presidency was relatively uneventful. Roosevelt rarely contacted him, even to inform him of major decisions; the President and Vice President met alone together only twice during their time together in office.{{sfn|Dallek|2008|p=16}}   In one of his first acts as vice president, Truman created some controversy when he attended the disgraced Pendergast's funeral. He brushed the criticism aside, saying simply, "He was always my friend and I have always been his."{{sfn|Oshinsky|2004|pp=365<U+2013>380}}   He had rarely discussed world affairs or domestic politics with Roosevelt and was uninformed about major initiatives relating to the war and the top-secret [[Manhattan Project]], which was about to test the world's first atomic bomb.{{sfn|U.S. History|2012}}

Truman had been vice president for only 82 days when President Roosevelt died on April 12, 1945.{{sfn|U.S. History|2012}}  That afternoon, Truman presided over the Senate as usual. He had just adjourned the session for the day and was preparing to have a drink in [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives|House Speaker]] [[Sam Rayburn]]'s office when he received an urgent message to go immediately to the White House. Truman assumed that President Roosevelt wanted to meet with him, but [[Eleanor Roosevelt]] informed him that her husband had died after suffering a massive [[cerebral hemorrhage]]. Truman's first concern was for Mrs. Roosevelt. He asked if there was anything he could do for her, to which she replied, "Is there anything we can do for you? You are the one in trouble now!"{{sfn|Truman Library|2012h}}{{sfn|McCullough|1992|p=425}}

Shortly after taking the oath of office, Truman said to reporters:

{{quote
| Boys, if you ever pray, pray for me now. I don't know if you fellas ever had a load of hay fall on you, but when they told me what happened yesterday, I felt like the moon, the stars, and all the planets had fallen on me.{{sfn|McCullough|1992|p=436}}{{sfn|Eye Witness|2012}}
}}

Upon assuming the presidency, Truman asked all the members of FDR's cabinet to remain in place, told them that he was open to their advice, but laid down a central principle of his administration: he would be the one making decisions, and they were to support him.{{sfn|McCullough|1992|p=348}}  Although Truman was told briefly on the afternoon of April 12 that the Allies had a new, highly destructive weapon, it was not until April 25 that [[United States Secretary of War|Secretary of War]] [[Henry Stimson]] told him the details.  Truman benefitted from a honeymoon period in the aftermath of Roosevelt's death, and from the [[Allies of World War II|Allies']] success in Europe, wrapping up the war there.  Truman was pleased to be able to issue the proclamation of [[Victory in Europe Day|V-E Day]] on May 8, 1945, his 61st birthday.{{sfn|McCoy|1984|pp=21<U+2013>22}}{{sfn|Dallek|2008|pp=19<U+2013>20}}

In the wake of Allied victory, Truman journeyed to Europe for the [[Potsdam Conference]], where he was when he learned that the [[Trinity (nuclear test)|Trinity test]] of the first atomic bomb on July 16 had been successful. He hinted to [[Joseph Stalin]] that the U.S. was about to use a new kind of weapon against the Japanese. Though this was the first time the Soviets had been officially given information about the atomic bomb, Stalin was already aware of the bomb project, having learned about it (through [[atomic spies|espionage]]) long before Truman himself did.{{sfn|PBS|2012}}{{sfn|Truman, Vol. 1|1955|p=416}}{{sfn|McCoy|1984|p=37}}

In August, after the Imperial government refused surrender demands, Truman authorized the atomic bombing of Japan.  Although it was not known how devastating the explosions and the aftermath would be, Truman, like most Americans, were not inclined to be merciful towards the Japanese in the wake of the long years of war.  Truman always stated that his decision to bomb Japan saved life on both sides; military estimates for [[Operation Downfall|an invasion]] of the Japanese home islands were that it could take a year and result in 250,000 to 500,000 American casualties.  He also knew that the program could cost $2 billion, and so he was not inclined to forgo an alternative that might quickly end the war.  Hiroshima was bombed on August 6 and Nagasaki on the 9th.  When the Japanese were still slow to surrender, Truman ordered a massive conventional air raid on Tokyo for August 13; Japan [[Surrender of Japan|agreed to surrender]] the following day.{{sfn|Miller|1974|pp=227<U+2013>231}}{{sfn|Dallek|2008|pp=24<U+2013>28}}

Supporters of Truman's decision argue that, given the tenacious Japanese defense of the outlying islands, the bombings saved hundreds of thousands of lives that would have been lost invading mainland Japan. In 1954, Eleanor Roosevelt said that Truman had "made the only decision he could," and that the bomb's use was necessary "to avoid tremendous sacrifice of American lives."{{sfn|Tenuth|2002}} Others have argued that the use of nuclear weapons was unnecessary and inherently immoral.{{sfn|Stohl|1988|p=279}} Truman wrote, later in life, that, "I knew what I was doing when I stopped the war&nbsp;... I have no regrets and, under the same circumstances, I would do it again."{{sfn|Truman|1963}}

==== Strikes and economic upheaval ====

The end of World War II was followed by an uneasy transition from war to a peacetime economy. Little planning had taken place, with officials assuming that it would take a year to beat Japan once war in Europe ceased, giving them time to create proposals. With the war's sudden end and an immediate clamor for demobilization, little work had been done to plan how best to transition to peacetime production of goods while avoiding mass unemployment for returning veterans. There was no consensus among government officials as to what economic course the postwar U.S. should steer. In addition, Roosevelt had not paid attention to Congress in his final years, and Truman faced a body where a combination of Republicans and conservative southern Democrats formed a powerful voting bloc.{{sfn|McCoy|1984|pp=42<U+2013>44}}

The president was faced with the reawakening of labor-management conflicts that had lain dormant during the war years, severe shortages in housing and consumer products, and widespread dissatisfaction with inflation, which at one point hit 6% in a single month.{{sfn|Miller Center|2012}} Added to this polarized environment was a wave of destabilizing strikes in major industries, and Truman's response to them was generally seen as ineffective.{{sfn|Miller Center|2012}} A rapid increase in costs was fueled by the release of price controls on most items, and labor sought wage increases.  A serious steel strike in January 1946 involving 800,000 workers<U+2014>the largest in the nation's history<U+2014>was followed by a coal strike in April and a rail strike in May.  The public was angry, with a majority in polls favoring a ban on strikes by public service workers and a year's moratorium on labor actions.  Truman proposed legislation to [[Conscription in the United States|draft]] striking workers into the Armed Forces, and in a dramatic personal appearance before Congress, was able to announce settlement of the rail strike.  His proposal passed the House of Representatives, but failed in the Senate.{{sfn|Dallek|2008|pp=39<U+2013>40}}{{sfn|McCoy|1984|pp=59<U+2013>60}}  For commodities where price controls remained, producers were often unwilling to sell at artificially low prices:  Farmers refused to sell grain for months in 1945 and 1946 until payments were significantly increased, even though grain was desperately needed, not only for domestic use, but to stave off starvation in Europe.{{sfn|McCoy|1984|pp=54<U+2013>55}}

Although labor strife was muted after the settlement of the railway strike, it continued through Truman's presidency.  The President's approval rating dropped from 82% in the polls in January 1946 to 52% by June.{{sfn|McCoy|1984|pp=64<U+2013>65}} This dissatisfaction with the Truman administration's policies led to large Democratic losses in the 1946 midterm elections, when Republicans took control of Congress for the first time since 1930.  The [[80th United States Congress|80th Congress]] included Republican freshmen who would become prominent in the years to come, including Wisconsin Senator [[Joe McCarthy]] and California Congressman [[Richard Nixon]].  When Truman dropped to 32% in the polls, Democratic Arkansas Senator [[William Fulbright]] suggested that Truman resign; the President in response indicated that he did not care what Senator "Halfbright" said.{{sfn|Dallek|2008|pp=48<U+2013>50}}{{sfn|McCoy|1984|p=91}}

Truman cooperated closely with the Republican leaders on foreign policy, though he fought them bitterly on domestic issues. The power of the labor unions was significantly curtailed by the [[Taft<U+2013>Hartley Act]], which was enacted [[veto override|over Truman's veto]].{{sfn|''Time''|1959-10-19}}  Truman twice vetoed bills to lower income tax rates in 1947. Although the initial vetoes were sustained, Congress overrode his veto of a tax cut bill in 1948.  The parties did cooperate on some issues; Congress passed the [[Presidential Succession Act of 1947]], making the Speaker of the House rather than the Secretary of State next in line to the presidency after the vice president.{{sfn|McCoy|1984|pp=96<U+2013>102}}  As he readied for the 1948 election, Truman made clear his identity as a Democrat in the [[New Deal]] tradition, advocating [[national health insurance]],{{sfn|Truman Library|1945}} the repeal of the Taft<U+2013>Hartley Act, and an aggressive civil rights program. Taken together, it all constituted a broad legislative agenda that came to be called the "[[Fair Deal]]."{{sfn|Dallek|2008|pp=84<U+2013>86}}  Truman's proposals were not well received by Congress, even with renewed Democratic majorities in Congress after 1948. Only one of the major Fair Deal bills, the [[Housing Act of 1949]], was ever enacted.{{sfn|Binning|Esterly|Sracic|1999|p=417}}{{sfn|''Time''|1949-06-06}} On the other hand, the major New Deal programs still in operation were not repealed, and there were minor improvements and extensions in many of them.{{sfn|Neustadt|1954|pp=349<U+2013>381}}

==== Foreign policy ====

[[File:President Truman and Prime Minister Mohammad Mossadegh of Iran.TIF|thumb|Truman with [[Prime Minister of Iran|Iranian prime minister]] [[Mohammad Mosaddegh]]]]

As a [[Wilsonian]] internationalist, Truman strongly supported creation of the United Nations, and included Eleanor Roosevelt on the delegation to the UN's first [[UN General Assembly|General Assembly]].{{sfn|Roosevelt|1961}} With the Soviet Union expanding its sphere of influence through Eastern Europe, Truman and his foreign policy advisors took a hard line against the USSR.  In this, he matched American public opinion, which quickly came to view the Soviets as intent upon world domination.{{sfn|Dallek|2008|pp=56<U+2013>57}}

Although he claimed no personal expertise on foreign matters, Truman won bipartisan support for both the [[Truman Doctrine]], which formalized a policy of Soviet [[containment]], and the [[Marshall Plan]], which aimed to help rebuild postwar Europe.{{sfn|Freeland|1970|p=90}}{{sfn|Roberts|2000}} To get Congress to spend the vast sums necessary to restart the moribund European economy, Truman used an ideological argument, arguing that Communism flourishes in economically deprived areas.{{sfn|Holsti|1996|p=214}} As part of the U.S. [[Cold War]] strategy, Truman signed the [[National Security Act of 1947]] and reorganized military forces by merging the [[United States Department of War|Department of War]] and the [[United States Department of the Navy|Department of the Navy]] into the National Military Establishment (later the [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]]) and creating the [[United States Air Force|U.S. Air Force]]. The act also created the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] and the [[United States National Security Council|National Security Council]].{{sfn|Dallek|2008|pp=62<U+2013>63}}

{{details|Berlin Blockade}}
On June 24, 1948, the Soviet Union blocked access to the three [[Berlin Soviet Zone|Western-held sectors]] of Berlin. The Allies had never negotiated a deal to guarantee supply of the sectors deep within the Soviet-occupied zone. The commander of the American occupation zone in Germany, General [[Lucius D. Clay]], proposed sending a large armored column across the Soviet zone to [[West Berlin]] with instructions to defend itself if it were stopped or attacked. Truman believed this would entail an unacceptable risk of war. He approved a plan to supply the blockaded city by air. On June 25, the Allies initiated the [[Berlin Airlift]], a campaign that delivered food and other supplies, such as coal, using military aircraft on a massive scale. Nothing like it had ever been attempted before, and no single nation had the capability, either logistically or materially, to have accomplished it. The airlift worked; ground access was again granted on May 11, 1949. Nevertheless, the airlift continued for several months after that. The Berlin Airlift was one of Truman's great foreign policy successes; it significantly aided his election campaign in 1948.{{sfn|Truman Library|1988a}}

==== Recognition of Israel ====

[[File:Truman receives menorah.jpg|thumb|President Truman in the Oval Office, receiving a [[Hanukkah]] [[Menorah (Hanukkah)|Menorah]] from the Prime Minister of Israel, [[David Ben-Gurion]] (center). To the right is [[Abba Eban]], Ambassador of Israel to the U.S.]]

Truman had long taken an interest in the history of the Middle East, and had read many books on ancient history and the events related in the Bible.  He was sympathetic to those who sought a Jewish homeland in [[Mandatory Palestine]].  As a senator, he had assured Jewish leaders of his support for [[Zionism]], and at a 1943 rally in Chicago had called for a homeland for those Jews who survived the Nazi regime.  A Jewish homeland in Palestine was widely popular in the United States, and Jewish support could be key in the upcoming presidential election.  However, State Department officials were reluctant to offend the Arabs, who were opposed to the establishment of a Jewish state in their midst.  Secretary of Defense [[James Forrestal]] warned Truman of the importance of [[Saudi Arabia]]n oil in another war; Truman replied that he would decide his policy on the basis of justice, not oil.{{sfn|McCullough|1992|pp=595<U+2013>597}}  Furthermore, when diplomats were called home from the Middle East to advise Truman and promoted the Arab point of view, Truman told them he had few Arabs among his constituents.{{sfn|McCullough|1992|p=599}}

American policy makers in 1947<U+2013>48 agreed that the highest foreign policy objective was containment of Soviet expansion as the Cold War unfolded. From the perspective of many officials, Palestine was secondary to the goal of protecting the "Northern Tier" of Greece, Turkey, and Iran from Communism, as promised by the Truman Doctrine.{{sfn|Ottolenghi|2004|pp=963<U+2013>988}}  Truman was weary of both the convoluted politics of the Middle East and of the urgings of Jewish leaders through his term in office, and was undecided on his policy.  He later cited as decisive in his decision to recognize the Jewish state the advice of his old business partner, Eddie Jacobson, a non-religious Jew whom Truman absolutely trusted.{{sfn|McCullough|1992|p=599}}  Truman made the decision to recognize Israel over the objections of Secretary of State [[George Marshall]], who feared it would hurt relations with the Arab states.  Marshall believed the paramount threat to the U.S. was the Soviet Union and feared that Arab oil would be lost to the United States in the event of war; he warned Truman that U.S. was "playing with fire with nothing to put it out".{{sfn|McCullough|1992|pp=604<U+2013>605}} Truman recognized the [[Israel|State of Israel]] on May 14, 1948, eleven minutes after [[Israeli Declaration of Independence|it declared itself a nation]].{{sfn|Lenczowski|1990|p=26}}{{sfn|Truman Library|1948}}

Truman later wrote:

{{quote
| Hitler had been murdering Jews right and left. I saw it, and I dream about it even to this day. The Jews needed some place where they could go. It is my attitude that the American government couldn't stand idly by while the victims [of] Hitler's madness are not allowed to build new lives.{{sfn|Berdichevsky|2012}}

=== 1948 election ===

{{details|United States presidential election, 1948}}

The [[United States presidential election, 1948|1948 presidential election]] is remembered for Truman's stunning come-from-behind victory.{{sfn|Hechler|Elsey|2006}} In the spring of 1948, Truman's public approval rating stood at 36%,{{sfn|Burnes|2003|p=137}} and the president was nearly universally regarded as incapable of winning the general election. The "New Deal" operatives within the party<U+2014>including FDR's son [[James Roosevelt|James]]<U+2014>tried to swing the Democratic nomination to General [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]], a highly popular figure whose political views and party affiliation were totally unknown. Eisenhower emphatically refused to accept, and Truman outflanked opponents to his nomination.{{sfn|Hechler|Elsey|2006}}

[[File:Deweytruman12.jpg|left|thumb|alt=Man in gray suit and wire glasses holding newspaper that says "Dewey Defeats Truman"|Truman was so widely expected to lose the 1948 election that the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' ran this incorrect headline.]]

At the [[1948 Democratic National Convention]], Truman attempted to unify the party by placing a vague civil rights plank in the party platform; the aim was to assuage the internal conflicts between the northern and southern wings of his party. Events overtook the president's efforts at compromise, however. A sharp address given by Mayor [[Hubert Humphrey]] of [[Minneapolis]]<U+2014>as well as the local political interests of a number of urban bosses<U+2014>convinced the Convention to adopt a stronger civil rights plank, which Truman approved wholeheartedly, but all of Alabama's delegates, and a portion of Mississippi's, walked out of the convention in protest.{{sfn|McCullough|1992|p=640}} Unfazed, Truman delivered an aggressive acceptance speech attacking the 80th Congress, which Truman called the "Do Nothing Congress",{{sfn|Miller Center|2012}} and promising to win the election and "make these Republicans like it."{{sfn|Hamby|2008}}

Within two weeks of the convention, Truman issued [[Executive Order 9981]], racially [[Racial integration|integrating]] the U.S. Armed Services.{{sfn|Center of Military History|2012}}{{sfn|Federal Register|1948}}{{sfn|Truman Library|1998}} Truman took considerable political risk in backing civil rights, and many seasoned Democrats were concerned that the loss of [[Dixiecrat]] support might destroy the Democratic Party. The fear seemed well justified<U+2014>South Carolina Governor [[Strom Thurmond]] declared his candidacy for the presidency on a Dixiecrat ticket and led a full-scale revolt of Southern "[[states' rights]]" proponents. This rebellion on the right was matched by one on the left, led by Wallace on the [[Progressive Party (United States, 1948)|Progressive Party]] ticket. Immediately after its first post-FDR convention, the Democratic Party found itself disintegrating. Victory in November seemed a remote possibility, with the party not simply split but divided three ways.{{sfn|McCoy|1984|pp=153<U+2013>158}}  For his running mate, Truman accepted Kentucky Senator [[Alben W. Barkley]], though he really wanted Justice Douglas, who turned down the nomination.{{sfn|Pietrusza|2011|pp=226<U+2013>232}}

The campaign was a remarkable {{convert|21928|mi|km|sing=on}} presidential odyssey.{{sfn|McCullough|1992|p=654}} In a personal appeal to the nation, Truman crisscrossed the U.S. by train; his "[[whistle stop train tour|whistle stop]]" speeches from the rear platform of the [[observation car]] ''[[Ferdinand Magellan Railcar|Ferdinand Magellan]]'' came to represent his campaign. His combative appearances, such as those at the town square of [[Harrisburg, Illinois|Harrisburg]], Illinois, captured the popular imagination and drew huge crowds. Six stops in [[Michigan]] drew a combined half-million people;{{sfn|McCullough|1992|p=657}} a full million turned out for a New York City ticker-tape parade.{{sfn|McCullough|1992|p=701}}

The large, mostly spontaneous gatherings at Truman's railcar events were an important sign of a change in momentum in the campaign, but this shift went virtually unnoticed by the national press corps, which continued reporting Republican [[Thomas Dewey]]'s apparent impending victory as a certainty. One reason for the press' inaccurate projection was polls conducted primarily by telephone in a time when many people, including much of Truman's populist base, did not own a telephone.{{sfn|Curran|Takata|2002}} This skewed the data to indicate a stronger support base for Dewey than existed, resulting in an unintended and undetected projection error that may have contributed to the perception of Truman's bleak chances. The three major polling organizations also stopped polling well before the November 2 election date<U+2014>[[Elmo Roper|Roper]] in September, and Crossley and [[The Gallup Organization|Gallup]] in October<U+2014>thus failing to measure the period when Truman appears to have surged past Dewey.{{sfn|Bennett|2012}}{{sfn|Truman Library|1971}}

In the end, Truman held his progressive Midwestern base, won most of the Southern states despite the civil rights plank, and squeaked through with narrow victories in a few critical states, notably Ohio, California, and Illinois. The final tally showed that the president had secured 303 electoral votes, Dewey 189, and Thurmond only 39. Henry Wallace got none. The defining image of the campaign came after Election Day, when an ecstatic Truman held aloft the erroneous front page of the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' with a huge headline proclaiming "[[Dewey Defeats Truman]]."{{sfn|Chicago Tribune|1948}}

=== Second term (1949<U+2013>1953) ===

Truman's inauguration was the first ever televised nationally.{{sfn|United States Senate|2005}} His second term was grueling, primarily because of foreign policy challenges connected directly or indirectly to his policy of containment. He quickly had to come to terms with the end of the American nuclear monopoly; with information provided by its espionage networks in the U.S., the Soviet Union's [[Soviet atomic bomb project|atomic bomb project]] progressed much faster than had been expected and they exploded their first bomb on August 29, 1949. In response, on January 7, 1953, Truman announced the detonation of the first U.S. [[Teller<U+2013>Ulam design|hydrogen bomb]].{{sfn|Atomic Archive|1953}}

==== Korean War ====

{{details|Korean War}}
[[File:Truman initiating Korean involvement.jpg|thumb|alt=Man in gray suit and glasses signing a document|President Truman signing a proclamation declaring a national emergency that initiates U.S. involvement in the Korean War]]

On June 25, 1950, [[Kim Il-sung]]'s [[Korean People's Army|North Korean People's Army]] invaded South Korea, starting the [[Korean War]].  In the early weeks of the war, the North Koreans easily pushed back their southern counterparts.{{sfn|McCoy|1984|pp=222<U+2013>227}}  Truman called for a naval blockade of Korea, only to learn that due to budget cutbacks, the U.S. Navy could not enforce such a measure.{{sfn|Truman Library, Memo|1950}} Truman promptly urged the United Nations to intervene; it did, authorizing troops under the UN flag led by U.S. General [[Douglas MacArthur]]. However, Truman decided not to consult with Congress, believing that most legislators supported his position; this would come back to haunt him later, when the stalemated conflict was dubbed "Mr. Truman's War" by legislators.{{sfn|McCoy|1984|pp=222<U+2013>227}}

By August 1950, U.S. troops pouring into South Korea under UN auspices were able to stabilize the situation.{{sfn|Dallek|2008|p=107}}  Responding to criticism over readiness, Truman fired his Secretary of Defense, [[Louis A. Johnson]], replacing him with the retired General Marshall.  With UN approval, Truman decided on a "rollback" policy<U+2014>conquest of North Korea.{{sfn|Matray|1979|pp=314<U+2013>333}} UN forces led by General MacArthur led the counterattack, scoring a stunning surprise victory with an amphibious landing at the [[Battle of Inchon]] that nearly trapped the invaders. UN forces then marched north, towards the [[Yalu River]] boundary with China, with the goal of reuniting Korea under UN auspices.{{sfn|Stokesbury|1990|pp=81<U+2013>90}}  However, China surprised the UN forces with a large-scale invasion in November. The UN forces were forced back to below the [[38th parallel north|38th parallel]], then recovered.  {{sfn|Cohen|Gooch|2006|pp=165<U+2013>195}} By early 1951 the war became a fierce stalemate at about the 38th parallel where it had begun.  Truman rejected MacArthur's request to attack Chinese supply bases north of the Yalu, but MacArthur nonetheless promoted his plan to Republican House leader [[Joseph William Martin, Jr.|Joseph Martin]], who leaked it to the press. Truman was gravely concerned that further escalation of the war might lead to open conflict with the Soviet Union, which was already supplying weapons and providing warplanes (with Korean markings and Soviet fliers). Therefore, on April 11, 1951, Truman fired MacArthur from his commands.{{sfn|Stokesbury|1990|pp=123<U+2013>129}}

The [[President Truman's relief of General Douglas MacArthur|dismissal of General Douglas MacArthur]] was among the least politically popular decisions in presidential history. Truman's approval ratings plummeted, and he faced calls for his [[impeachment]] from, among others, Senator [[Robert Taft]].{{sfn|Strout|1999}} Fierce criticism from virtually all quarters accused Truman of refusing to shoulder the blame for a war gone sour and blaming his generals instead. Others, including Eleanor Roosevelt, supported and applauded Truman's decision. MacArthur meanwhile, returned to the U.S. to a hero's welcome, and addressed a joint session of Congress, a speech which the President called "a bunch of damn bullshit."{{sfn|Weintraub|2000}}

The war remained a frustrating stalemate for two years, with over 30,000 Americans killed, until an armistice ended the fighting in 1953.{{sfn|Chambers II|1999|p=849}}  In February 1952, Truman's approval mark stood at 22% according to [[Gallup poll]]s, which was, until [[George W. Bush]] in 2008, the all-time lowest approval mark for an active American president.{{sfn|Roper|2010}}

==== Worldwide defense ====

The escalation of the Cold War was highlighted by Truman's approval of [[NSC-68]], a secret statement of foreign policy. It called for tripling the defense budget, and the globalization and militarization of containment policy whereby the U.S. and its NATO allies would respond militarily to actual Soviet expansion. The document was drafted by [[Paul Nitze]], who consulted State and Defense officials; it was formally approved by President Truman as official national strategy after the war began in Korea. It called for partial mobilization of the U.S. economy to build armaments faster than the Soviets. The plan called for strengthening Europe, weakening the Soviet Union, and for building up the U.S. both militarily and economically.{{sfn|Wells, Jr.|1979|pp=116<U+2013>158}}  One tragedy, early in Truman's second term, came with the death of Secretary of Defense Forrestal, soon after his retirement.  Forrestal had burned himself out through years of hard labor during and after the war, and began to suffer mental issues.  He retired in March 1949; soon after, he was hospitalized and committed suicide in May.{{sfn|Mitchell|1998|pp=223<U+2013>228}}

Truman was a strong supporter of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization ([[NATO]]), which established a formal peacetime military alliance with Canada and many of the democratic European nations that had not fallen under Soviet control following World War II.  The treaty establishing it was widely popular and easily passed the Senate in 1949; Truman appointed General Eisenhower as commander. NATO's goals were to contain Soviet expansion in Europe and to send a clear message to communist leaders that the world's democracies were willing and able to build new security structures in support of democratic ideals. The U.S., Britain, France, Italy, the Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg, Norway, Denmark, Portugal, Iceland, and Canada were the original treaty signatories.  The alliance resulted in the Soviets establishing a similar alliance, called the [[Warsaw Pact]].{{sfn|McCoy|1984|pp=197<U+2013>199, 232}}{{sfn|Dallek|2008|pp=89<U+2013>91}}

General Marshall was Truman's principal adviser on foreign policy matters, influencing such decisions as the U.S. choice not to offer direct military aid to [[Chiang Kai-shek]] and his Nationalist Chinese forces in the [[Chinese Civil War]] against their communist opponents.  Marshall's opinion was contrary to the counsel of almost all of Truman's other advisers<U+2014>he saw that even propping up Chaing's forces would drain U.S. resources in Europe needed to deter the Soviets.{{sfn|May|2002|pp=1001<U+2013>1010}} When the communists took control of the mainland, driving the Nationalists to [[Taiwan]] and establishing the [[People's Republic of China]], Truman would have been willing to maintain some relationship between the U.S. and the new government, but Mao was unwilling.{{sfn|Ferrell|1994|pp=217<U+2013>218, 224}} In June 1950, Truman ordered the U.S. Navy's [[United States Seventh Fleet|Seventh Fleet]] into the [[Taiwan Strait]] to prevent further conflict between the communist government on the China mainland and the [[Republic of China]] (ROC) on Taiwan.{{sfn|Donovan|1983|pp=198<U+2013>199}}

==== Soviet espionage and McCarthyism ====

In August 1948, [[Whittaker Chambers]], a former spy for the Soviets and a senior editor at ''Time'' magazine, testified before the [[House Un-American Activities Committee]] (HUAC) stating that an underground communist network had been working  within the U.S. government since the 1930s, of which Chambers had been a member, along with [[Alger Hiss]], until recently a senior State Department official. Although Hiss denied the allegations, he was convicted in January 1950 for perjury for his denials under oath.  The Soviet Union's success in exploding an atomic weapon in 1949 and the fall of the nationalist Chinese the same year led many Americans to conclude that subversion by Soviet spies was responsible, and to demand that communists be rooted out from the government and other places of influence.{{sfn|Dallek|2008|pp=87<U+2013>88}}{{sfn|McCoy|1984|pp=194, 217<U+2013>218}}

Following Hiss's conviction, Secretary of State [[Dean Acheson]] announced that he stood by him.  This and other events, such as the revelation that British atomic bomb scientist [[Klaus Fuchs]] was a spy, led current and former members of HUAC, including Congressman Nixon of California and [[Karl Mundt]] of South Dakota to decry Truman and his administration, especially the State Department, as soft on communism. Wisconsin Senator McCarthy used a [[Lincoln Day]] speech in [[Wheeling, West Virginia]] to accuse the State Department of harboring communists, and rode the controversy to political fame.{{sfn|Weinstein|1997|pp=450<U+2013>451}}  In the following years, Republicans used Hiss' conviction to castigate the Democrats for harboring communists in government; Congressman Nixon [[United States Senate election in California, 1950|gained election to the Senate in 1950]] on an anti-communist platform, defeating the liberal [[Helen Gahagan Douglas]], whom he called "the Pink Lady".{{sfn|Weinstein|1997|pp=452<U+2013>453}}

Charges that Soviet agents had infiltrated the government were believed by 78% of the people in 1946, and became a major campaign issue for Eisenhower in 1952.{{sfn|Troy|2008|p=128}} Truman tried to steer a middle course, both seeking to show that he was concerned with internal security, but fearing that innocents would be harmed and government activities disrupted.  In 1949 he called American communist leaders, whom his administration [[Smith Act trials of Communist Party leaders|was prosecuting]], "traitors", but in 1950 he vetoed the [[McCarran Internal Security Act]], though it was passed over his veto.{{sfn|McCoy|1984|pp=216<U+2013>217, 234<U+2013>235}} Truman would later state in private conversations with friends that his creation of a loyalty program had been a "terrible" mistake.{{sfn|McCullough|1992|p=553}}

==== White House renovations; assassination attempt ====
{{details|Truman assassination attempt}}
[[File:White-house-1950-interior-shell.jpg|thumb|alt=Inside of a building being renovated, with scaffolding|View of the interior shell of the White House during reconstruction in 1950]]

In 1948, Truman ordered a controversial addition to the exterior of the [[White House]]: a second-floor balcony in the south portico that came to be known as the "[[Truman Balcony]]." The addition was unpopular; some stated it spoiled the appearance of the south facade, but it gave the First Family more living space.{{sfn|White House Museum|1952}}{{sfn|Truman Library, Balcony|2012}} {{sfn|Truman Library, Balcony II|2012}}  The work uncovered structural faults which led engineering experts to conclude that the building, much of it over 130 years old, was in a dangerously dilapidated condition. That August, a section of floor collapsed and Truman's own bedroom and bathroom were closed as unsafe. No public announcement about the serious structural problems of the White House was made until after the 1948 election had been won, by which time Truman had been informed that his new balcony was the only part of the building that was sound. As a result, the Truman family moved into nearby [[Blair House]].  As the newer [[West Wing]], including the [[Oval Office]], remained open, Truman found himself walking to work across the street each morning and afternoon. In due course, the decision was made to demolish and rebuild the whole interior of the main White House, as well as excavate new basement levels and underpin the foundations. The famous exterior of the structure, however, was buttressed and retained while the renovations proceeded inside. The work lasted from December 1949 until March 1952.{{sfn|McCullough|1992|pp=593, 652, 725, 875ff}}

}}

On November 1, 1950, [[Puerto Rico|Puerto Rican]] nationalists [[Griselio Torresola]] and [[Oscar Collazo]] attempted to assassinate Truman at Blair House. On the street outside the residence, Torresola mortally wounded a White House policeman, [[Leslie Coffelt]]. Before he died, the officer shot and killed Torresola. Collazo, as a co-conspirator in a felony that turned into a homicide, was found guilty of murder and sentenced to death in 1952. Truman later commuted his sentence to life in prison. Acknowledging the importance of the question of Puerto Rican independence, Truman allowed for a plebiscite in Puerto Rico to determine the status of its relationship to the U.S. The attack, which could easily have taken the president's life, drew new attention to security concerns surrounding his residence at Blair House. He had jumped up from his nap, and was watching the gunfight from his open bedroom window until a passerby shouted at him to take cover.{{sfn|Hunter|Bainbridge, Jr.|2005|pp=4, 251}}{{sfn|Ayoob|2006}}

==== Steel and coal strikes ====

{{details|1952 steel strike}}

In response to a labor/management impasse arising from bitter disagreements over wage and price controls, Truman instructed his [[United States Secretary of Commerce|Secretary of Commerce]], [[Charles W. Sawyer]], to take control of a number of the nation's steel mills in April 1952. Truman cited his authority as Commander in Chief and the need to maintain an uninterrupted supply of steel for munitions to be used in the war in Korea. The Supreme Court found Truman's actions unconstitutional, however, and reversed the order in a major [[separation of powers|separation-of-powers]] decision, ''[[Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer]]''. The 6<U+2013>3 decision, which held that Truman's assertion of authority was too vague and was not rooted in any legislative action by Congress, was delivered by a Court composed entirely of Justices appointed by either Truman or Roosevelt. The high court's reversal of Truman's order was one of the notable defeats of his presidency.{{sfn|Higgs|2004}}

==== Scandals and controversies ====

In 1950, the Senate, led by [[Estes Kefauver]], investigated numerous charges of corruption among senior administration officials, some of whom received [[fur coat]]s and [[refrigerator|deep freezers]] in exchange for favors. A large number of employees of the  [[Internal Revenue Service|Internal Revenue Bureau]]  (today the IRS) were accepting bribes; 166 employees either resigned or were fired in 1950,{{sfn|Smaltz|1998}} with many soon facing indictment. When Attorney General [[J. Howard McGrath]] fired the special prosecutor in early 1952 for being too zealous, Truman fired McGrath.{{sfn|University of North Texas Libraries|1996}}  Truman submitted a reorganization plan to reform the IRB; Congress passed it, but the corruption was a major issue in the 1952 presidential election.{{sfn|McCoy|1984|p=299}}{{sfn|Donovan|1983|pp=116<U+2013>117}}

On December 6, 1950, music critic [[Paul Hume]] wrote a critical review of a concert by Margaret Truman:
{{quote
| Miss Truman is a unique American phenomenon with a pleasant voice of little size and fair quality&nbsp;... [she] cannot sing very well&nbsp;... is flat a good deal of the time<U+2014>more last night than at any time we have heard her in past years&nbsp;... has not improved in the years we have heard her&nbsp;... [and] still cannot sing with anything approaching professional finish.{{sfn|Truman Library, FAQ|1950}}
}}
Harry Truman wrote a scathing response:
{{quote
| I've just read your lousy review of Margaret's concert. I've come to the conclusion that you are an 'eight ulcer man on four ulcer pay.' It seems to me that you are a frustrated old man who wishes he could have been successful. When you write such poppy-cock as was in the back section of the paper you work for it shows conclusively that you're off the beam and at least four of your ulcers are at work. Some day I hope to meet you. When that happens you'll need a new nose, a lot of beefsteak for black eyes, and perhaps a supporter below! [[Westbrook Pegler|Pegler]], a gutter snipe, is a gentleman alongside you. I hope you'll accept that statement as a worse insult than a reflection on your ancestry.{{sfn|Truman Library, FAQ|1950}}
}}

Truman was criticized by many for the letter. However, he pointed out that he wrote it as a loving father and not as the president.{{sfn|Barnes|2008}}{{sfn|Giglio|2001|p=112}}{{sfn|Smith|2001}}

=== Civil rights ===

{{further|President's Committee on Civil Rights}}

A 1947 report by the Truman administration titled ''To Secure These Rights'' presented a detailed ten-point agenda of civil rights reforms. In February 1948, the president submitted a civil rights agenda to Congress that proposed creating several federal offices devoted to issues such as [[voting rights]] and [[employment discrimination|fair employment]] practices. This provoked a storm of criticism from Southern Democrats in the runup to the national nominating convention, but Truman refused to compromise, saying: "My forebears were Confederates&nbsp;... but my very stomach turned over when I had learned that Negro soldiers, just back from overseas, were being dumped out of Army trucks in Mississippi and beaten."{{sfn|Truman|1973|p=429}}  Tales of the abuse, violence, and persecution suffered by many African American veterans upon their return from World War II infuriated Truman, and were a major factor in his decision to issue [[Executive Order 9981]], in July 1948, desegregating and requiring equal opportunity in the Armed Forces.{{sfn|Kirkendall|1989|pp=10<U+2013>11}}  After several years of planning, recommendations and revisions between Truman, the Committee on Equality of Treatment and Opportunity and the various branches of the military, Army units became racially integrated.{{sfn|MacGregor|1981|pp=312<U+2013>315, 376<U+2013>378, 457<U+2013>459}}

Another executive order, also in 1948, made it illegal to discriminate against persons applying for civil service positions based on race. A third, in 1951, established the [[Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs|Committee on Government Contract Compliance]] (CGCC). This committee ensured that defense contractors did not discriminate because of race.{{sfn|National Archives|1948}}{{sfn|National Archives|1953}}

=== Judicial appointments ===

==== Supreme Court ====

{{main|Harry S. Truman Supreme Court candidates}}

Truman appointed the following Justices to the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]]:

* [[Harold Hitz Burton]]&nbsp;<U+2013> 1945
* [[Fred M. Vinson]] ([[Chief Justice of the United States|Chief Justice]])&nbsp;<U+2013> 1946
* [[Tom C. Clark]]&nbsp;<U+2013> 1949
* [[Sherman Minton]]&nbsp;<U+2013> 1949

Truman's judicial appointments have been called by critics "inexcusable."{{sfn|Eisler|1993|p=76}} A former Truman aide confided that it was the weakest aspect of Truman's presidency.{{sfn|Eisler|1993|p=76}} The ''New York Times'' condemned the appointments of [[Tom C. Clark]] and [[Sherman Minton]] in particular as examples of cronyism and favoritism for unqualified candidates.{{sfn|Eisler|1993|p=76}}

The four justices appointed by Truman joined with Justices [[Felix Frankfurter]], [[Robert H. Jackson]], and [[Stanley Forman Reed|Stanley Reed]] to create a substantial seven-member conservative bloc on the Supreme Court.{{sfn|Eisler|1993|p=76}} This returned the court for a time to the conservatism of the 1920s.{{sfn|Eisler|1993|p=76}}

==== Other courts ====

{{main|Harry S. Truman judicial appointments}}

In addition to his four Supreme Court appointments, Truman appointed 27 judges to the [[United States Courts of Appeals|Courts of Appeals]], and 101 judges to [[United States district courts|federal district courts]].{{sfn|Federal Judicial Center}}

=== 1952 election ===

{{details|United States presidential election, 1952}}
[[File:President Harry Truman, Adlai Stevenson, and John Sparkman2.gif|thumb|left|alt=Three men at a desk reviewing a document|From left: President Harry S. Truman, Vice Presidential nominee, [[Alabama]] Senator [[John J. Sparkman]] and presidential nominee, [[Governor of Illinois|Illinois Governor]] [[Adlai Stevenson II|Adlai Stevenson]]. [[Oval Office]], 1952]]

In 1951, the U.S. ratified the [[Twenty-second Amendment to the United States Constitution|22nd Amendment]], making a president ineligible to be elected for a third time, or to be elected for a second time after having served more than two years of a previous president's term. The latter clause would have applied to Truman in 1952, except that a [[grandfather clause]] in the amendment explicitly excluded the current president from this provision.{{sfn|Find Law|2012}}

At the time of the 1952 New Hampshire primary, no candidate had won Truman's backing. His first choice, Chief Justice [[Fred M. Vinson]], had declined to run; Illinois Governor [[Adlai Stevenson II|Adlai Stevenson]] had also turned Truman down, Vice President Barkley was considered too old,{{sfn|McCullough|1992|p=887}}{{sfn|Ambrose|1983|p=515}} and Truman distrusted and disliked Senator Kefauver, who had made a name for himself by his investigations of the Truman administration scandals.  Truman had hoped to recruit General Eisenhower as a Democratic candidate, but found him more interested in seeking the Republican nomination.  Accordingly, Truman let his name be entered in the [[New Hampshire primary]] by supporters. The highly unpopular Truman was handily defeated by Kefauver; 18 days later the president announced he would not seek a second full term. Truman was eventually able to persuade Stevenson to run, and the governor gained the nomination at the [[1952 Democratic National Convention]].{{sfn|Dallek|2008|pp=139<U+2013>142}}

Eisenhower gained the Republican nomination, with Senator Nixon as his running mate, and campaigned against what he denounced as Truman's failures: "Korea, Communism and Corruption".  He pledged to clean up the "mess in Washington,"{{sfn|McCullough|1992|p=887}}{{sfn|Ambrose|1983|p=515}}  and promised to "go to Korea."{{sfn|Hurwood|Gosfield|1969|p=123}} Eisenhower defeated Stevenson decisively in the [[United States presidential election, 1952|general election]], ending 20 years of Democratic rule. While Truman and Eisenhower had previously been good friends, Truman felt betrayed that Eisenhower did not denounce Joseph McCarthy during the campaign.{{sfn|''Time''|1973-11-10}}  Similarly, Eisenhower was outraged when Truman, who made a whistlestop tour in support of Stevenson, accused the former general of disregarding "sinister forces&nbsp;... Anti-Semitism, anti-Catholicism, and anti-foreignism" within the Republican Party.{{sfn|Dallek|2008|p=144}}  Eisenhower was so outraged he threatened not to make the customary ride down Pennsylvania Avenue with the departing president before the inauguration, but to meet Truman at the steps to the Capitol, where the swearing-in takes place.{{sfn|Dallek|2008|p=144}}

== Post-presidency ==

[[File:HarryTruman.jpg|thumb|right|upright|alt=Painting of Caucasian man in dark suit with wire glasses and gray hair|Official White House portrait of Harry S. Truman]]
Upon leaving the presidency, Truman returned to Independence, Missouri, to live at the Wallace home he and Bess had shared for years with her mother.{{sfn|Truman Library|2012i}}  Once out of office, Truman quickly decided that he did not wish to be on any corporate payroll, believing that taking advantage of such financial opportunities would diminish the integrity of the nation's highest office. He also turned down numerous offers for commercial endorsements. Since his earlier business ventures had proved unsuccessful, he had no personal savings. As a result, he faced financial challenges. Once Truman left the White House, his only income was his old army pension: $112.56 per month.{{sfn|Vaccaro|1953}} Former members of Congress and the federal courts received a federal retirement package; President Truman himself ensured that former servants of the executive branch of government received similar support. In 1953, however, there was no such benefit package for former presidents,{{sfn|Congressional Research Service|2008}} and he received no pension for his Senate service.{{sfn|Dallek|2008|p=150}}

[[File:Lyndon Johnson signing Medicare bill, with Harry Truman, July 30, 1965.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Two men at a desk with a document one is signing with their wives standing behind them|Truman (seated right) and his wife Bess (behind him) attend the signing of the [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]] Bill on July 30, 1965, by President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]]]]

Truman took out a personal loan from a Missouri bank shortly after leaving office, and then set about establishing another precedent for future former chief executives: a book deal for his memoirs of his time in office. [[Ulysses S. Grant]] had overcome similar financial issues with his own memoirs, but the book had been published posthumously, and he had declined to write about life in the White House in any detail. For the memoirs, Truman received only a flat payment of $670,000, and had to pay two-thirds of that in tax; he calculated he got $37,000 after he paid his assistants.{{sfn|Ferrell|1994|p=387}}  However, the memoirs were a commercial and critical success;{{sfn|''Time''|1956-08-13}}<ref name="nevins" /> they were published in two volumes in 1955 and 1956 by Doubleday (Garden City, N.Y) and Hodder & Stoughton (London): ''Memoirs by Harry S. Truman: Year of Decisions'' and ''Memoirs by Harry S. Truman: Years of Trial and Hope''.{{sfn|Truman, Vol. 1|1955|loc=title page}}{{sfn|Truman, Vol. 2|1956|loc=title page}}

The former president was quoted in 1957 as saying to then-House Majority Leader [[John William McCormack|John McCormack]], "Had it not been for the fact that I was able to sell some property that my brother, sister, and I inherited from our mother, I would practically be on relief, but with the sale of that property I am not financially embarrassed."{{sfn|McCullough|1992|p=963}} The following year, Congress passed the [[Former Presidents Act]], offering a $25,000 yearly pension to each former president, and it is likely that Truman's financial status played a role in the law's enactment.{{sfn|Congressional Research Service|2008}} The one other living former president at the time, [[Herbert Hoover]], also took the pension, even though he did not need the money; reportedly, he did so to avoid embarrassing Truman.{{sfn|Martin|1960|p=249}}

Truman's predecessor, Franklin D. Roosevelt, had organized his own [[presidential library]], but legislation to enable future presidents to do something similar had not been enacted. Truman worked to garner private donations to build a presidential library, which he donated to the federal government to maintain and operate<U+2014>a practice adopted by his successors.{{sfn|Burnes|2003|pp=217<U+2013>218}}  He testified before Congress to have money appropriated to have presidential papers copied and organized, and was proud of the bill's passage in 1957.  Max Skidmore, in his book on the life of former presidents, noted that Truman was a well-read man, especially in history.  Skidmore added that the presidential papers legislation and the founding of his library "was the culmination of his interest in history.  Together they constitute an enormous contribution to the United States<U+2014>one of the greatest of any former president."{{sfn|Skidmore|2004|pp=123<U+2013>124}}

[[File:TrumanFuneralWreath.jpg|thumb|Wreath at Truman's casket on the day of his funeral, December 27, 1972, Independence, Missouri]]

Truman supported Adlai Stevenson's second bid for the White House in 1956, although he had initially favored Democratic Governor [[W. Averell Harriman]] of New York.{{sfn|Ohio State|2012}} He continued to campaign for Democratic senatorial candidates for many years.{{sfn|Truman Library|1965}}  Upon turning 80 in 1964, Truman was feted in Washington, and addressed the Senate, availing himself of a new rule that allowed former presidents to be granted [[Floor privileges of the United States Senate|privilege of the floor]].{{sfn|McCullough|1992|p=983}}  After a fall in his home in late 1964, his physical condition declined. In 1965, President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] signed the [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]] bill at the [[Harry S. Truman Library & Museum]] and gave the first two Medicare cards to Truman and his wife Bess to honor the former president's fight for government health care while in office.{{sfn|Truman Library|1965}}

On December 5, 1972, Truman was admitted to Kansas City's Research Hospital and Medical Center with lung congestion from [[pneumonia]]. He developed multiple organ failure and died at 7:50&nbsp;am on December 26 at the age of 88.{{sfn|Truman Library|2012i}} Bess Truman opted for a simple private service at the library for her husband rather than a state funeral in Washington. A week after the funeral, foreign dignitaries and official Washington attended a memorial service at [[Washington National Cathedral]].  Bess died in 1982; they both are buried at the Harry S.

=== Legacy ===

[[File:Truman pass-the-buck.jpg|thumb|alt=Man in suit sitting behind desk with sign that says "The buck stops here"|Former President Harry Truman with "[[The Buck Stops Here]]" sign on a recreation of his Oval Office desk]]

When he left office in 1953, Truman was one of the most unpopular chief executives in history. His job approval rating of 22% in the Gallup Poll of February 1952 was lower than Richard Nixon's 24% in August 1974, the month that Nixon resigned. American public feeling towards Truman grew steadily warmer with the passing years; as early as 1962, a poll of 75 historians conducted by [[Arthur M. Schlesinger, Sr.]] ranked Truman among the "near great" presidents. The period following his death consolidated a partial rehabilitation of his legacy among both historians and members of the public. .{{sfn|''Wisconsin Magazine of History''|Autumn, 1975}}   Truman died when the nation was consumed with crises in [[Vietnam War|Vietnam]] and [[Watergate scandal|Watergate]], and his death brought a new wave of attention to his political career.{{sfn|''Time''|1973-12-03}} In the early and mid-1970s, Truman captured the popular imagination much as he had in 1948, this time emerging as a kind of political folk hero, a president who was thought to exemplify an integrity and accountability many observers felt was lacking in [[Presidency of Richard Nixon|the Nixon White House]].  This public reassessment of Truman was aided by the popularity of a book of reminiscences which Truman had told to journalist [[Merle Miller]] beginning in 1961, with the agreement that they would not be published until after Truman's death.{{sfn|Dallek|2008|pp=149, 152}}

Truman had his latter-day critics as well. After a review of information available to Truman about the presence of espionage activities in the U.S. government, Democratic Senator [[Daniel Patrick Moynihan]] concluded that Truman was "almost willfully obtuse" concerning the danger of American communism.{{sfn|Moynihan|1997}} In 2010, historian Alonzo Hamby concluded that "Harry Truman remains a controversial president."{{sfn|Hamby|2002}}  However, since leaving office, Truman has fared well in [[Historical rankings of Presidents of the United States|polls ranking the presidents]]. He has never been listed lower than ninth, and most recently was fifth in a ''[[C-SPAN]]'' poll in 2009.{{sfn|CSPAN|2009}}

The fall of the Soviet Union in 1991 caused Truman advocates to claim vindication for Truman's decisions in the postwar period.  According to Truman biographer Robert Dallek, "His contribution to victory in the cold war without a devastating nuclear conflict elevated him to the stature of a great or near-great president."{{sfn|Dallek|2008|p=152}}  The 1992 publication of [[David McCollough]]'s favorable biography of Truman further cemented the view of Truman as a highly regarded Chief Executive.{{sfn|Dallek|2008|p=152}}  According to historian Daniel R. McCoy in his book on the Truman presidency,

{{quote |
Harry Truman himself gave a strong and far-from-incorrect impression of being a tough, concerned and direct leader.  He was occasionally vulgar, often partisan, and usually nationalistic&nbsp;... On his own terms, Truman can be seen as having prevented the coming of a third world war and having preserved from Communist oppression much of what he called the free world.  Yet clearly he largely failed to achieve his Wilsonian aim of securing perpetual peace, making the world safe for democracy, and advancing opportunities for individual development internationally.{{sfn|McCoy|1984|pp=318<U+2013>319}}
