He also starred in the television series ''Believe'' on Spike TV and the television show ''[[Phenomenon (TV series)|Phenomenon]]''.

He also holds multiple world-records made during his magic performances, and was named Magician of the Decade in 2009 and Magician of the Century in 2010 by the International Magicians Society.

==Early life==
On December 19, 1967,<ref name=bio /> Criss Angel was born at Hempstead General Hospital in [[Hempstead, New York]], on [[Long Island]]. He is of [[Greece|Greek]] descent.<ref name=people.com>{{cite web |url = http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20041633,00.html | title = Criss Angel (Sort Of) Explains Cameron Diaz Shout-Out | first= Mark | last= Gray | work = [[People (magazine)|People]] | date= June 6, 2007 | quote=Look, I'm Greek.}}</ref><ref name="Kopka2010">{{cite book|first=Deborah | last= Kopka|title=Eastern Europe and Russia: Eastern Europe and Russia|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=mIGoq6MHY2QC&pg=PA49|accessdate=6 April 2012|date=25 November 2010|publisher=Lorenz Educational Press|isbn=978-1-4291-2252-8|pages=49}}</ref> Angel was raised in [[Elmont, New York|Elmont]] until fourth grade, when his family moved to [[East Meadow, New York]].<ref name=newsday>{{cite news | url =http://www.newsday.com/entertainment/tv/criss-angel-on-his-new-show-believe-it-s-healthy-to-be-skeptical-1.6241144 | authorlink = Frank Lovece | first= Frank | last= Lovece | work = [[Newsday]] | location = [[New York City]] / [[Long Island]] | title = Criss Angel on his new show, 'BeLIEve': 'It's healthy' to be skeptical | date= October 15, 2013 | accessdate=2013-10-29}}</ref> His father, John Sarantakos, owned a restaurant and doughnut shop.<ref name=fff /> He developed an interest in magic at age seven and performed his first show at the age of twelve, for which he was paid $10. His main early influence was [[Harry Houdini]]. By fourteen, Angel was performing throughout high school at restaurants in East Meadow, including the Wine Gallery. Angel's first major illusion was making his mother float in their family den.<ref name=bio /><ref name=fff /> Early in his career he was helped by animal breeder and reality-television host [[Marc Morrone]], who helped Angel find and train a set of [[doves]] for his act.<ref>{{cite book |url=http://books.google.ca/books?id=KGqPYrTgdZsC&pg=PA97&dq=Criss+Angel&hl=en&sa=X&ei=hVn9UvTlOuXXygHqxoDoBA&ved=0CEwQ6AEwBDgU#v=onepage&q=Criss%20Angel&f=false |page=97 |accessdate=February 13, 2014 |title=A Man for All Species: The Remarkable Adventures of an Animal Lover and Expert Pet Keeper |author=Marc Morrone and Nancy Ellis-Bell |publisher=Random House |year=2010}}</ref>

By the time he graduated from [[East Meadow High School]], he had decided to pursue a career as a professional magician instead of attending college as his parents wanted.<ref name= LVSbio>{{cite news | url = http://www.lasvegassun.com/criss-angel/bio/ | title = Criss Angel biography | work =[[Las Vegas Sun]] | date= Undated | author = Unbylined | accessdate= November 20, 2009}}</ref> According to ''[[Biography Channel]]'', "Angel hit the road and began touring with other traveling performance acts. Between traveling and performing, he attempted to further his education in his own by studying the history of magic in public libraries. He also studied the art of mysticism, music, martial arts and even dance."<ref name=bio />

==Early career==
Angel has said that, "I stayed away from magicians when I was younger because I didn't want to think like them and wanted to create my own style."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-152743534.html |title=Now you see them: magic goes mainstream as bigscreen pics, cable hits and Vegas hipsters offer more than card tricks |accessdate=February 13, 2014 |author=Karen Idelson |date=September 15, 2006 |publisher=''[[Daily Variety]]''}}</ref> His first television appearance as in 1994, where he performed as a part of a one-hour ABC primetime special entitled ''Secrets''.<ref name=bio>{{cite web |url=http://www.biography.com/people/criss-angel-244776?page=1 |publisher=''Biography'' |accessdate=February 12, 2014 |title=Criss Angel Biography}}</ref> One of the early supporters of Angel was horror director [[Clive Barker]]. In 1995, Barker asked Angel to work with him on his film ''[[Lord of Illusions]]''. He also later recorded the intro to Angel's album ''World of Illusion: System One''. Barker said of Angel in the mid-1990s that, "Criss Angel is extraordinary, a spectacular mix of visionary magic. This is the future, and it can<U+2019>t come quickly enough."<ref name=Leachone /> In 1998 Angel performed a ten minute show over the course of the "World of Illusion" conference in [[Madison Square Garden]], performing sixty shows per day.<ref name=fff />

Angel also starred in 1997 television movice ''The Science of Magic'' and its 2003 sequel ''The Science of Magic II''.<ref name=IMDBio />  ''Criss Angel Mindfreak'', which would later become Angel's first television series, was originally an off-Broadway show by Angel, which in 2001 was picked up by the World Underground Theatre. When not performing the show, Angel worked the streets promoting the show to pedestrians.<ref name=fff /> ''Criss Angel Mindfreak'' ran for more than 600 performances at the World Underground Theater in Times Square, between 2001 and 2003.<ref name=bio /> His twenty-four hours in the tank of water set a world record for the longest amount of time for a human to be completely submerged under water.<ref name=xst /> This performance would also become a part of his first television special. 

Angel has also been known to actively discourage a belief in mediumship, stating that there is no way for mediums to speak with people beyond the dead. He has said, "If somebody's doing that for entertainment purposes, that's one thing. But if they claim to be communicating with the dead, I don't care if they're from my hometown, I don't care if they're my family members: I'll expose them and tell them what they really are."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.newsday.com/entertainment/tv/criss-angel-on-his-new-show-believe-it-s-healthy-to-be-skeptical-1.6241144 |title=Criss Angel on his new show, 'BeLIEve': 'It's healthy' to be skeptical |date=October 11, 2013 |accessdate=March 7, 2014 |publisher=''Newday'' |author=Frank Lovece}}</ref>

===Water torture cell in Times Square, 2002===
In August 2002 Angel spent 24 hours shackled underwater in a phone booth-sized water torture cell near the [[WWE]] entertainment store in New York's Times Square, WWE corporation being the owners of the World Underground Theatre where Angel had been performing his stage show. To prepare for the trick, he practiced in a neighbor's backyard swimming pool next to his mother's house in [[East Meadow, New York]]. Prior to the performance he had only managed to spent 12 consecutive hours in the water. He fasted for twenty-four hours before the performance to make it through the period without need to exit and use the washroom. During the trick he went through sixteen oxygen tanks. After the trick he was required to remove his own shackles and chains before exiting the water. Within an hour, his skin began to react substantially to the water.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P1-55678806.html |publisher=[[Associated Press]] |accessdate=February 12, 2014 |date=August 26, 2002 |title=Illusionist, trained in backyard pool, tries 24 hours underwater in Times Square tank |author=Sarah Kugler}}</ref>

At the end of the performance, according to Ted Shaffrey, "Before he emerged from the phone-booth sized contraption of clear plastic and steel, Angel yanked out the air hose that allowed him to breathe. Then assistants pulled a black curtain over the 220-gallon (832-liter) chamber to block the view of television cameras and about 100 people gathered outside the window in which he was displayed. Under cover, Angel apparently escaped from the shackles that bound his arms, legs and neck, before pulling himself from the watery chamber with a celebratory scream." Upon successfully completing the trick, he was described as having "skin crinkled and his eyes bloodshot", and upon emerging from the tank he was taken to St. Clare's Hospital and treated for severe dehydration. He reported afterwards that he had suffered from overheating, jaw fatigue, and semi-consciousness while in the tank.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P1-55742086.html |title=Illusionist emerges after 24 hours underwater, thanks crowd, plugs show, passes out |author=Ted Shaffrey |accessdate=February 12, 2014 |date=August 27, 2002 |publisher=[[Associated Press]]}}</ref>

==Television specials and promotional appearances (2002-2005)==
On October 20, 2002, Angel performed in the [[ABC Family]] television special named ''Criss Angel Mindfreak: Postmodern illusionist'', an hour-long performance and tribute to Harry Houdini.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-92409790.html |title='Halloween' promo estimate: $2.5m.(ABC Family) |publisher=''Multichannel News'' |accessdate=February 13, 2014 |date=September 30, 2002 |author=Jim Forkan}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-92719076.html |date=October 10, 2002 |accessdate=February 13, 2014 |title=Television highlights for the week of Oct. 20-26 |publisher=''Knight Ridder''}}</ref> The special aired again on December 24, 2002 on [[Channel 4]] in the UK. The ''[[Birmingham Evening Mail]]'' reviewed the show, writing, "Criss Angel is currently making a name for himself as a more provocative, darker alternative to [other illusionists]. He walks the streets of New York, hypnotising passers-by, turning cups of take-away coffee into cockroaches and suspending himself from the ceiling by inserting hooks into his back. The piece de resistance of all these mind games is an update of the Houdini underwater trick - an attempt to stay in a (cell) tank of water for 24 hours, padlocked and restrained. All seems to be going well, until the filter system breaks down and the water begins to heat up."<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-95641043.html |date=December 20, 2002 |title=TV: Tune in to the alternative magical experience.(Features) |accessdate=February 13, 2014 |publisher=''[[Birmingham Evening Mail]]''}}</ref>

On October 31, 2003 [[SciFi Channel]] aired the one-hour special ''Supernatural'' starring Angel. Kate O'Hare said of the special that, "Filmed in part at Universal Theme Park in Orlando, Fla., "Supernatural" finds Angel crawling up buildings, passing a quarter through his skin, spontaneously combusting and having otherworldly creatures burst from his chest." When asked about his process in creating television specials, Angel said that, "I like to have my hand in everything on my TV specials. I'm the executive producer; I direct it; I create it. I write all the music for my TV specials and my live performances. It's on my label. I write it; I produce it."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-109476924.html |publisher=''Knight Ridder'' |accessdate=February 12, 2014 |title=Illusionist Criss Angel calls out Blaine for duel |date=October 30, 2003}}</ref> During the special Angel performed stunts including lighting himself on fire and making a tarantula emerge from a pedestrian's soda can.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://nypost.com/2003/10/30/magics-fallen-angel/ |title=Magic's Fallen Angel |accessdate=March 7, 2014 |date=October 30, 2003 |author=Linda Stasi |publisher=''[[New York Post]]''}}</ref> In 2003 Angel was also featured in the two-hour TBS special ''Made in Japan''.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.cirquedusoleil.com/en/shows/believe/criss-angel/mindfreak.aspx |title=Cirque du Soleil Criss Angel |accessdate=February 13, 2014}}</ref>

In early 2003, Angel performed at the release of the new branding for [[Miller Lite]] beer in [[Milwaukee, Wisconsin]] on the 80th anniversary of Houdini's last performance in that city. For the performance, he was suspended ten stories in the air and bound in a straightjacket, from which he escaped.<ref>{{cite web |publisher=''Drug Chain Review'' |accessdate=February 13, 2014 |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-98439152.html |date=March 3, 2003 |title=Brewers adept at reaching the consumer}}</ref> He also performed an illusion at [[Ozzfest]] in 2005.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-135505800.html |publisher=''Broadcasting & Cable'' |author=Glenn Pere |accessdate=February 13, 2014 |date=August 22, 2005 |title=Hint to broadcast networks: bold is beautiful}}</ref> During this period Angel also earned money selling signed merchandise, making up to $50,000 a day signing merchandise for fans.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-34001.html |publisher=''[[Washington Post]]'' |accessdate=February 13, 2013 |title=Hey, Grads!

Keenly aware of the camera at all times, Angel manages to offer some personality, especially where family is involved.

In July 2008 Angel escaped from a beachside hotel before its demolition, before a crowd of about 50,000 people, an illusion that also aired on the television program. After the illusion, Angel showed the audience step by step how he achieved the escape. He first picked open a set of handcuffs that had him shackled to a balcony railing. He then smashed the window of the room in order to enter the hotel, and picked padlocks on both the room's internal door and the door to the stairwell. The escape was initially supposed to occur via a ladder that dangled above the hotel's roof 30 seconds before collapse, after picking through five locks on the roof's door. Instead, Angel emerged from the rubble after the collapse, claiming that the initial plan was always to escape via the helicopter. The total time allotted for the entire illusion was 4 minutes, with dynamite located on the first, second, and fourth floors of the building.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tampabay.com/news/humaninterest/criss-angel-escapes-an-imploding-hotel-mdash-but-not-as-expected/749628 |title=Criss Angel escapes an imploding hotel <U+2014> but not as expected |author=Mike Donila and Jackie Alexander |date=July 30, 2008 |accessdate=March 7, 2014 |publisher=''[[Tampa Bay Times]]''}}</ref>

In April 2009, Angel ended a performance of ''Believe'' by "hurling obscene insults" at blogger [[Perez Hilton]], an audience member. Hilton reportedly had texted to his fans during the performance that the show was "unbelievably BAD" and that he'd "rather be getting a [[root canal]]", and word had gotten back to Angel by the end of the performance.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lvrj.com/news/43243067.html | first= Norm | last= Clarke | title=Coarse shout-out stirs up Tweeters | work = Las Vegas Review-Journal | date = April 19, 2009  |accessdate=September 26, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|date = April 20, 2009 | url = http://vegasblog.latimes.com/vegas/2009/04/perez-hiltons-excellent-vegas-adventure.html |title=Perez Hilton's excellent Vegas adventure, from Criss Angel to Miss USA | first=Richard | last = Abowitz | work=Los Angeles Times | accessdate = September 26, 2010 | archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20110930033752/http://vegasblog.latimes.com/vegas/2009/04/perez-hiltons-excellent-vegas-adventure.html | archivedate= September 30, 2011}}</ref> Cirque du Soleil later apologized to Hilton for Angel's remarks.<ref>{{cite news | first=Richard | last = Abowitz | url = http://vegasblog.latimes.com/vegas/2009/04/perez-hiton-gets-apology-from-cirque-angel-remains-silent.html |title=Perez Hiton gets apology from Cirque; Angel remains silent |work=Los Angeles Times |date=April 20, 2009 | accessdate=September 26, 2010 | archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20090423053142/http://vegasblog.latimes.com/vegas/2009/04/perez-hiton-gets-apology-from-cirque-angel-remains-silent.html | archivedate = April 23, 2009}}</ref>

In 2010 the ''Las Vegas Sun'' critic John Katsilometes, after being unimpressed by the initial show, said ''Believe'' had improved by reducing the narrative elements and focusing on the magic.<ref>{{cite news | last = Katsilometes | first= John | date = January 2, 2011 | url = http://www.lasvegassun.com/blogs/kats-report/2011/jan/02/believe-it-angels-work-has-markedly-improved-luxor/ | title = <U+2018>Believe<U+2019> it: Criss Angel<U+2019>s work has markedly improved Luxor show | work = Las Vegas Sun | accessdate= 2012-12-12}}</ref> In 2011 the ''Toronto Star'' wrote: <U+201C>The show is easily the most exciting thing now on stage in Vegas!<U+201D><ref>{{cite news | url=http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/thestar/access/2230019331.html?FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT&type=current&date=Jan+5%2C+2011&author=Richard+Ouzounian&pub=Toronto+Star&edition=&startpage=E.5&desc=Sin+City+offers+plenty+of+theatrical+second+chances | first=Richard | last=Ouzounian | title=Sin City offers plenty of theatrical second chances | date=January 5, 2011}}</ref> That year the show attracted an estimated $150 million in ticket sales.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.newsweek.com/can-celine-dion-save-las-vegas-66205# |date=March 13, 2011 |accessdate=March 7, 2014 |title=Can Celine Dion Save Las Vegas? |author=Tony Dokoupil |publisher=''[[Newsweek]]''}}</ref> The show currently has a ten year performance contract that runs through 2019,<ref name=juj>{{cite news |url=http://www.lasvegassun.com/vegasdeluxe/2013/dec/11/criss-angel-reveals-new-luxor-show-during-two-mont/ |publisher=''[[Las Vegas Sun]]'' |accessdate=February 12, 2014 |date=December 11, 2013 |title=Criss Angel reveals new Luxor show to run during rehab for shoulder surgery |author=Robin Leach}}</ref> and was the best selling magic show in Las Vegas as of 2013.<ref name=Leachtwo />

===Television series===
The show celebrated its fifth anniversary of appearing on stage in October 2013. That month a cable television series based upon the show entitled ''Believe'' was broadcast on [[Spike TV]]. The first season included eleven one hour episodes, including 118 different illusions. Guests on the show include [[Ludacris]], [[Ice-T]], [[Randy Couture]] and [[Shaquille O<U+2019>Neal]]. When asked about the three years between the last episode of ''Mindfreak'' and his return to television, Angel stated that, "I didn<U+2019>t take long at all to go back to television. It was my choice to work on the live Cirque show and to get that where I wanted it to be.

"Now that that show is just humming and doing amazing business <U+2014> it<U+2019>s the #1 bestselling magic show in the world as far as ticket sales and the perception that people are experiencing and coming back to see it multiple times <U+2014> I felt it was in a great place and I could think about television again. Obviously, <U+201C>Believe<U+201D> will continue to evolve until its last performance because I always want to add new magic, I<U+2019>m always tweaking and transforming it. I missed being on television, I had something new creatively to say, and Spike became the perfect home to do it."<ref name=Leach /> [[Endemol]] purchased the foreign distribution rights for the show, and was the "most-watched new original series [on A&E] in more than 18 months" according to the ''[[Hollywood Reporter]]''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/endemol-takes-international-rights-spike-654154 |publisher=''[[Hollywood Reporter]]'' |accessdate=February 13, 2014 |title=Endemol Takes International Rights to Spike TV's 'Criss Angel Believe' |author=Greg Szalai |date=November 7, 2013}}</ref>

In the episode "Lord of Illusions <U+2014> Death Premonition", Angel paid homage to Clive Barker, the director of the horror movie of the same name. In the episode Angel performed the closing stunt from the film, in which he laid beneath a circle of suspended swords, and predicted the correct order of six falling swords to avoid becoming stabbed through his body after their release, that are selected by the audience by a randomly bouncing ball. According to the ''[[Las Vegas Sun]]'', "Criss is the only, and first, magician in the world granted permission from the inventor and filmmaker to re-create the film<U+2019>s death-defying stunt."<ref name=Leachone>{{cite web |url=http://www.lasvegassun.com/vegasdeluxe/2013/nov/19/war-wizards-criss-angel-and-david-blaine-duel-riva/ |publisher=''[[Las Vegas Sun]]'' |accessdate=February 12, 2014 |date=November 19, 2013 |title=A war of wizards: Criss Angel and David Blaine duel with rival TV shows |author=Robin Leach}}</ref>

For another one of the episodes for the series filmed in New York City he was asked by the NYPD not to pre-announce the performance, as crowd control for some Angel performances had become a concern for the police.<ref name=Leach /> This trick saw Angel hanging his feet, while bound with two straightjackets and a noose around his neck which were attached to metal weights. While he was successful in the trick, Angel tore his shoulder muscles and required surgery in January 2014. This resulted in the temporary closing of the ''Believe'' stage show between January and April 2014, while he is recovering from the surgery and returning to performance shape. He did however host a new stage show featuring other magicians between February and March 2014 in lieu of performing in his own show.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.lasvegassun.com/vegasdeluxe/2013/nov/26/criss-angel-gets-all-choked-his-spike-tv-series-be/ |author=Robin Leach |accessdate=February 12, 2014 |publisher=''[[Las Vegas Sun]]'' |date=November 26, 2013 |title=Criss Angel gets all choked up for his Spike TV series <U+2018>Believe<U+2019>}}</ref> Clips from the show also became the most watched YouTube magic clips in the history of the site, with more than 15 million views.<ref name=Leachtwo />

==''Criss Angel Magicjam''==
The temporary replacement show for ''Believe'' was entitled ''Criss Angel Magicjam'', performing in the same Luxor theatre. According to the ''[[Las Vegas Sun]]'', the show included, "Longtime Las Vegas comedy-illusionist Nathan Burton; Banachek, the world<U+2019>s premiere mentalist; and new female magician Krystyn Lambert, who has been prominently featured in the Spike series ... joined by grandmaster manipulators Jason Byrne and Tony Clarke, supreme close-up artist Armando Vera and the magic comedy of Russ Merlin."

Starting in October 2007 he appeared as a judge on ''[[Phenomenon (TV series)|Phenomenon]]'', with [[Uri Geller]] and in a CNN interview about the show he told [[Larry King]] "no one has the ability, that I'm aware of, to do anything supernatural, psychic, talk to the dead.

{{wikinews|Criss Angel challenges Uri Geller and Jim Callahan over paranormal claims}}
On the October 31, 2007 episode of the reality show ''Phenomenon'', [[Mentalism|Paranormalist]] Jim Callahan performed a [[Conjuration|summoning]], purportedly of author [[Ray Hill|Raymond Hill]], to help discover the contents of a locked box.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/21576519/ | title=Angel sparks altercation on <U+2018>Phenomenon<U+2019> | publisher=[[MSNBC]] |date=November 1, 2007 | first=| last=  | accessdate =November 7, 2007}}</ref>  Although fellow judge [[Uri Geller]] praised the performance, Angel called it "comical" and subsequently challenged both Callahan and Geller to guess the contents of two envelopes he pulled out of his pocket, offering a million dollars of his own money to whoever could do so. This led to an argument between Callahan and Angel, during which Callahan walked toward Angel and called him an "ideological bigot", with the two pulled apart as the show promptly went to a commercial break. Angel has since revealed the contents of one envelope and at the unveiling he challenged Geller one more time. Geller responded, "Although we were born one day apart - I was born on the 20th of December and you on the 19th - a lot of years between us - 40 years, you were one year old when I came out with my spoon bending..." Criss Angel cut him off at this point, saying, "I guess this is a 'no,'" and proceeded to open the envelope. The envelope contained an [[index card]] with the numbers "911" printed on it for [[September 11 attacks|September 11, 2001]]. Angel's explanation was this: "If on 9-10 somebody could have predicted that 9-11 was going to happen, they could have saved thousands of lives". The other envelope's contents was scheduled to be revealed on the first episode of Season 4 of ''Criss Angel: Mindfreak''.<ref name=fff>{{cite web |url=http://www.lasvegassun.com/criss-angel/bio/ |title=Criss Angel Bio |accessdate=February 12, 2014 |publisher=''[[Las Vegas Sun]]''}}</ref>

His musical style continues to be in the heavy metal style, though when describing his musical style he has said, "There are elements where it's more electronic, and there are orchestrated sections. I decided to take it in different places because I'm inspired by emotion and by giving people a connection, a sense of a feeling <U+2014> whether it's excitement or crying or being happy." He also produced soundtracks for his television series ''Mindfreak'', including collaborations with members of [[Korn]] and [[Godsmack]].<ref name=mtv>{{cite web |publisher=[[MTV.com]] |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1533441/criss-angel-brings-freak-on-new-album.jhtml |title=Illusionist Criss Angel Freaks On New LP, Freaks Out Ice Cube With Magic |author=Chris Harris |date=June 2, 2006 |accessdate=February 12, 2014}}</ref>
