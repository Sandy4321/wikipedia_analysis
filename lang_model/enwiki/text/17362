'''''Illinois'' (BB-65)''' was to be the fifth {{sclass|Iowa|battleship}} constructed for the [[United States Navy]] and was the fourth ship to be [[ship naming and launching|named]] in honor of [[Illinois|the 21st US state]].

Hull BB-65 was originally to be the first ship of the {{sclass|Montana|battleship}}s, but changes during [[World War II]] resulted in her being reordered as an {{sclass|Iowa|battleship}}. Adherence to the ''Iowa''-class layout rather than the ''Montana''-class layout allowed BB-65 to gain eight knots in speed, carry more 20&nbsp;mm and 40&nbsp;mm anti-aircraft guns, and transit the locks of the [[Panama Canal]]; however, the move away from the ''Montana''-class layout left BB-65 with a reduction in the heavier armaments and without the additional armor that were to have been added to BB-65 during her time on the drawing board as USS ''Montana''.

Like her sister ship {{USS|Kentucky|BB-66|2}}, ''Illinois'' was still under construction at the end of World War II. Her construction was canceled in August 1945, but her hull remained until 1958 when it was broken up.

== Design ==

{{main|Montana class battleship|Iowa class battleship}}

The passage of the [[Second Vinson Act]] in 1938 had cleared the way for construction of the four [[South Dakota class battleship (1939)|''South Dakota''-class]] battleships and the first two ''Iowa'' class [[fast battleship]]s (those with the hull numbers BB-61 and BB-62).{{sfn|Rogers|p=7}} The latter four battleships of the class, those designated with the hull numbers BB-63, BB-64, BB-65, and BB-66 were not cleared for construction until 1940,{{sfn|Rogers|p=8}} and at the time BB-65 and BB-66 were intended to be the first ships of the ''Montana''-class.{{sfn|Gardiner & Chesneau|p=99}}

Originally, BB-65 was to be the United States Navy's counter to the [[Empire of Japan]]'s {{sclass|Yamato|battleship|1}}s, whose construction at the time was known to the highest-ranking members of the United States Navy, along with the rumors that the ''Yamato''-class ships would carry guns of up to {{convert|18|in|mm|abbr=on}}. To combat this, the United States Navy began designing a 58,000 ton ship with an intended armament of twelve {{convert|16|in|mm|abbr=on}} guns. This battleship took shape in the mid-1930s as USS ''Montana'', the lead ship of her class of [[dreadnought]] battleships. She would have fielded three more {{convert|16|in|mm|abbr=on}} guns than those mounted aboard the ''Iowa''-class, a more powerful secondary battery of [[5"/54 caliber Mark 16 gun|{{convert|5|in|mm|abbr=on}}/54 caliber Mark 16]] [[Dual purpose gun|dual purpose]] mounts, and an increase in armor designed to enable ''Montana'' to withstand the effects of enemy guns comparable to her own.{{sfn|Gardiner & Chesneau|p=100}}

The increase in ''Montana''{{'}}s firepower and armor came at the expense of her speed and her [[Panamax]] capabilities, but the latter issue was to be resolved through the construction of a third, much wider set of locks at the [[Panama Canal]]. As the situation in Europe deteriorated in the late-1930s, the USA began to be concerned once more about its ability to move warships between the oceans. The largest US battleships were already so large as to have problems with the canal locks; and there were concerns about the locks being put out of action by enemy bombing. In 1939, to address these concerns, construction began on a new set of locks for the canal that could carry the larger warships which the US had either under construction or planned for future construction.{{efn|name=Panama locks}} These locks which would have enabled ''Montana'' to transit between the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans without the need to sail around the tip of South America.{{sfn|Gardiner & Chesneau|p=100}} As USS ''Montana,'' BB-65 would have been the only battleship class [[Ship commissioning|commissioned]] by the US to approach the [[Imperial Japanese Navy]]'s ''Yamato'' class on the basis of armor, armament, and tonnage.{{sfn|Garzke|Dulin|1995|p=171}}{{sfn|Friedman|p=239}}

By 1942 the United States Navy shifted its building focus from battleships to [[aircraft carrier]]s after the successes of carrier combat in both the [[Battle of the Coral Sea]], and to a greater extent, the [[Battle of Midway]].<ref name="spring"/>
As a result the construction of the US fleet of {{sclass|Essex|aircraft carrier}}s had been given the highest priority for completion in the US [[shipyard]]s by the US Navy.{{sfn|Minks}} The ''Essex''-class carriers were proving vital to the war effort by enabling the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] to gain and maintain [[air supremacy]] in the [[Pacific War]], and were rapidly becoming the principal striking arm of the United States Navy in the ongoing effort to defeat the Empire of Japan.<ref name="discovery"/> Accordingly, the United States accepted shortcomings in the armor for their {{sclass|North Carolina|battleship|2}}s, [[South Dakota class battleship (1939)|''South Dakota''-class]], and {{sclass|Iowa|battleship|6}}s in favor of additional speed, which enabled these battleship classes to steam at a comparable speed with the ''Essex''-class and provide the carriers with the maximum amount of anti-aircraft protection.<ref name="discovery" />{{Better source|date=August 2012}}

== Development ==
When BB-65 was redesignated an ''Iowa'' class battleship, she was assigned the name ''Illinois'' and reconfigured to adhere to the "[[fast battleship]]" designs planned in 1938 by the Preliminary Design Branch at the [[Bureau of Construction and Repair]].{{efn|name=design changes}}{{sfn|Johnston & McAuley|pp=108<U+2013>123}} Her funding was authorized via the passage of the [[Two-Ocean Navy Act]] by the US Congress on 19 July 1940,{{efn|name=two ocean navy}} and she would now be the fifth ''Iowa'' class battleship built for the United States Navy.{{sfn|Johnston & McAuley|pp=108<U+2013>123}}{{sfn|Dulin|Garzke|1976|p=137}} Her contract was assigned on 9 September 1940, the same date as ''Kentucky''.{{sfn|Whitley|p=310}} ''Illinois''{{'}}s [[keel]] was laid down at the [[Philadelphia Naval Shipyard]], on 6 December 1942;{{sfn|Whitley|p=306}} her projected completion date was 1 May 1945.{{sfn|Whitley|p=310}} This amounted to a construction time of about 30 months. She would be tasked primarily with the defense of the US fleet of ''Essex''-class aircraft carriers. In adherence with the ''Iowa''-class design, ''Illinois'' would have a maximum beam of {{convert|108|ft|m|abbr=on}} and a waterline length of {{convert|860|ft|m|abbr=on}}, permitting a maximum speed of {{convert|32.5|kn|km/h|1}}.{{sfn|Gardiner & Chesneau|p=99}}

Like ''Kentucky'', ''Illinois'' differed from her earlier sisters in that her design called for an all-welded construction, which would have saved weight and increased strength over a combination riveted/welded hull used on the four completed ''Iowa''-class ships. Engineers considered retaining the original ''Montana'' class armor for added [[torpedo]] and [[naval mine]] protection because the newer scheme would have improved ''Illinois''{{'}}s armor protection by as much as 20%.<ref name="armor"/>{{Better source|date=August 2012}} This was rejected due to time constraints and ''Illinois'' was built with an ''Iowa''-class hull design.{{sfn|Gardiner & Chesneau|p=99}} Funding for the battleship was provided in part by "[[King Neptune (pig)|King Neptune]]", a Hereford swine auctioned across the state of Illinois as a fund raiser, and ultimately helped raise $19 million in [[war bonds]]<ref name="Py-Lieberman"/>

== Fate ==

[[File:USS Illinois Bell.JPG|thumb|Bell from the USS ''Illinois'']]
     
''Illinois''{{'}}s construction was put on hold in 1942 after the [[Battle of Coral Sea|Battles of Coral Sea]] and [[Battle of Midway|Midway]], while the Bureau of Ships considered an [[aircraft carrier]] conversion proposal for ''Illinois'' and ''Kentucky''. As proposed, the converted ''Illinois'' would have had an {{convert|864|ft|adj=on}} long by {{convert|108|ft|adj=on}} wide flight deck, with an armament identical to the carriers of the {{sclass|Essex|aircraft carrier|4}}: four twin 5-inch gun mounts and four more 5-inch guns in single mounts, along with six 40&nbsp;mm quadruple mounts. It was abandoned after the design team decided that the converted carriers would carry fewer aircraft than the ''Essex'' class, that more ''Essex''-class carriers could be built in the same amount of time to convert the battleships, and that the conversion project would be significantly more expensive than new ''Essex''es. Instead, ''Illinois'' and ''Kentucky'' were to be completed as battleships, but their construction was given very low priority.{{sfn|Garzke|Dulin|1995|p=288}}

Ultimately, the ship was canceled on 11 August 1945, when she was about 22% complete.{{sfn|Dulin|Garzke|1976|p=137}} She was struck from the [[Naval Vessel Register]] on 12 August 1945.{{sfn|DANFS Illinois (BB-65)}}{{sfn|NVR Illinois (BB 65)}} Her incomplete hulk initially was retained on the belief that it could be used as a target in nuclear weapons tests. The cost to complete the ship enough to be able to launch her&mdash;some $30&nbsp;million&mdash;was too great, however, and the plan was abandoned. She remained in the dockyard until September 1958, when she was [[Ship breaking|broken up]] on the builder's ways.{{sfn|Dulin|Garzke|1976|p=137}}{{sfn|Whitley|p=311}}

The [[ship's bell]] was cast, and is now at the [[Memorial Stadium (Champaign)|Memorial Stadium]] at the [[University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign]]. It reads ''USS Illinois 1946''. The bell is on loan from the Naval Historical Center (Accession #70-399-A), Washington Navy Yard, Washington DC, to the [[Naval Reserve Officers Training Corps]] (NROTC) at the university. The bell is traditionally rung by NROTC members when the football team scores a touchdown or goal.{{sfn|Herman|2007}}

{{efn

| This was not the first time that changes to the ''Iowa'' class had been proposed: at the time the battleships were cleared for construction some policymakers were not sold on the U.S. need for more battleships, and proposed turning the ''Iowa''-class ships into aircraft carriers by retaining the hull design, but switching their decks to carry and handle aircraft (This had already been done on the [[battlecruiser]]s {{USS|Lexington|CV-2|2}} and {{USS|Saratoga|CV-3|2}}). The proposal was countered by [[Admiral]] [[Ernest King]], the Chief of Naval Operations. {{cite web | title = BB-61 Iowa-class Aviation Conversion | url = http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/systems/ship/bb-61-av.htm | accessdate = 19 May 2007 }}{{Better source|date=August 2012}}
