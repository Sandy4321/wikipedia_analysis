'''The Valley Library''' is the primary [[library]] of [[Oregon State University]] and is located at the school's main campus in [[Corvallis, Oregon|Corvallis]] in the [[United States|U.S.]] state of [[Oregon]]. Established in 1887, the school built its first library building in 1918, what is now Kidder Hall. The current building opened in 1963 as the '''William Jasper Kerr Library''' and was expanded and renamed in 1999 as The Valley Library. The library is named for philanthropist [[F. Wayne Valley]], who played football for Oregon State.

One of three libraries for Oregon State, The Valley Library stores more than 1.4 million volumes, 14,000 serials, and more than 500,000 maps and government documents. It is designated as a [[Federal Depository Library Program|Federal Depository Library]] and is also a repository for state documents. The six-story library building is of a contemporary, [[Neoclassical architecture|neoclassical style]] with a red-brick exterior highlighted by white sections along the top and on part of the eastern side. The eastern side includes a white-faced [[Rotunda (architecture)|rotunda]] that includes a two-story atrium on the main floor.

The Special Collections also include the papers of [[Bernard Malamud]], William Appleman Williams, Milton Harris, Paul Emmett, David P. Shoemaker, Ewan Cameron, Fritz Marti, Eugene Starr, and Roger Hayward.<ref name="special collections"/> The library is decorated throughout with 120 pieces of the Northwest Art Collection. Oregon's [[Percent for Art]] law set aside one percent of construction costs for artwork, which was then selected by the library along with the [[Oregon Arts Commission]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://osulibrary.oregonstate.edu/libraries_and_collections/art/|title=Northwest Art Collection|work=Libraries|publisher=Oregon State University|accessdate=6 May 2010}}</ref>
