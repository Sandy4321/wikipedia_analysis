'''Jan Masureel''' (born September 6, 1981 in [[Bruges]]) is a [[Belgium|Belgian]] professional [[football (soccer)|football]] player. He is a tall and powerful [[Football_%28soccer%29_positions#Full-back_.28FB.2FRB.2FLB.29|full-back]], who also likes to play in an attacking role. On the other hand, Masureel is not one of the fastest runners.

Masureel started his career at [[Cercle Brugge]], where he made his debut for the first team in 2001, in a 2-0 home win against [[F.C. Denderleeuw|FC Denderleeuw]]. When Cercle achieved promotion to the [[Belgian League|Belgian First Division]] in 2003, Jan Masureel was told to search for a new team. Being a fan of Cercle Brugge, Masureel didn't want to leave and asked the management to give him a chance at the top level. In the end, Jan Masureel was offered a new contract.

In 2006, Masureel was loaned for a whole season to [[K.M.S.K. Deinze|SK Deinze]] in the [[Belgian Second Division]], where he was one of the best goalscorers of the team with 8 goals, despite having played as full-back all the time. 

On June 22, 2007, it was revealed that Masureel's transfer to [[KV Oostende]] was completed. He's playing with [[K.V. Red Star Waasland]] for the 2008-2009 season.
