The '''Battle of Oltu''' was actually two battles, the first (18 June to 25 June 1920) was a battle between [[Democratic Republic of Armenia|Armenian]] troops and local [[Turkish revolutionaries|Turkish militia]]{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}} in [[Oltu]] district, [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]].<ref name="Hewsen-237">Hewsen, Robert H. and Salvatico, Christopher C. (2001) ''Armenia: A Historical Atlas'' University of Chicago Press, Chicago, p. 237. ISBN 0-226-33228-4</ref> And the second was when Turkish troops drove Armenian troops out of Oltu district on 3<U+2013>5 September 1920.

==Background==
[[World War I]] was over and the [[Ottoman Empire]] had lost.  The [[Russian Empire]] had come apart in the [[Russian Civil War]] with separate governments being formed in [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] and [[Armenia]].  The [[Treaty of S<U+00E8>vres]] which established the new boundaries for the Ottoman Empire had not yet been signed. The district of Oltu, known then as Ardahan-Olty,<ref>[http://books.google.com/books?vid=0la-8ohDO1fBFnnREd&id=DHczWUKjRrEC&pg=RA6-PA40&lpg=RA6-PA40&dq=olty+armenia&ie=ISO-8859-1 ''The New York Times Current History: A Monthly Magazine: The European War'' Vol XIX, 1919, p. ]</ref> was annexed by Russia in 1878, attached to Georgia, which assumed [[de jure]] authority over it when they claimed independence on May 26, 1918. [[Democratic Republic of Armenia]] was proclaimed two days later, on May 28, 1918.

==First battle==
The conflict arose when the [[Democratic Republic of Georgia]] failed to maintain control over their westernmost province, the district of Oltu, and local [[Muslim]] warlords<ref name="Andersen">[http://www.conflicts.rem33.com/images/Armenia/turkarwar.htm Andersen, Andrew (2004) "Turkish-Armenian War Sept.-Nov. 1920"]</ref> assumed control in their stead. The local Turkish tribes had skirmished with Armenian border troops, and as a result the local Armenian commander initiated a [[punitive expedition]] into the Oltu district. On 16 June 1920 Armenian forces invaded the Oltu district and annexed to DRA. Meanwhile the Treaty of S<U+00E8>vres was signed confirming the validity of the Armenian state, but giving Armenia much less territory than originally proposed by [[Woodrow Wilson]].

==Second battle==
In August, the Armenian government attempted to occupy the Oltu district. In response, General [[Kaz<U+0131>m Karabekir]] led four Turkish battalions into the district on September 3 and drove the Armenians out. Karabekir then pushed into the Democratic Republic of Armenia on September 20<ref name="Andersen" /> prompting the Armenian government to declare war on [[Turkey]] four days later.<ref name="Ru-TuArm">[http://safety.spbstu.ru/book/hrono/hrono/sobyt/1920arm.html Turkish-Armenian War of 1920] in Russian</ref>
