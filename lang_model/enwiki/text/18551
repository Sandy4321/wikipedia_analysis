'''Orenthal James "O. J." Simpson''' (born [[July 9]], [[1947]]), also known by his nickname, '''The Juice''', is a retired [[American football]] [[player (game)|player]], [[actor]], [[spokesman]] and [[broadcaster]], who earned infamy for having been tried for the murder of his ex-wife [[Nicole Brown Simpson]] and her friend [[Ronald Goldman]] in 1994. He originally attained stardom as a [[running back]] at the [[college football|collegiate]] and professional levels, and was the first [[National Football League|NFL]] player to [[rush (American football)|rush]] for more than 2,000 yards in a season.  Simpson's rushing mark was set during the [[1973 NFL season|1973]] season.

Simpson was [[Acquittal|acquitted]] of the murder of Nicole Brown Simpson and her friend Ronald Goldman in 1995 after a [[O. J. Simpson murder case|lengthy, highly publicized criminal trial]]. In 1997, a default judgment against Simpson was awarded for their wrongful deaths in [[Civil law (common law)|civil court]] by a jury, but to date he has paid little of the $33.5 million judgment.<ref name="spending">[http://web.archive.org/web/20070305235730/http://www.cnn.com/2007/LAW/02/08/simpson.lawsuit.ap/index.html O.J.

The book, which purports to be a first-person fictional account of the murder had he actually committed it, was withdrawn by the publisher just before its release. The book was later released by the Goldman family and the title of the book was expanded to ''If I Did It: Confessions of the Killer'' (ISBN 978-0825305887). In September 2007, Simpson faced more legal troubles, as he was arrested<ref name=autogenerated1>{{cite web |url=http://news.findlaw.com/hdocs/docs/oj/nvoj91607arrstrpt.html |format=[[HTML]] |date=[[16 September]] [[2007]] |accessdate=2007-09-18 |publisher=FindLaw |title=O.J.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Simpson was born in [[San Francisco, California|San Francisco]], [[California]], the son of Eunice ([[married and maiden names|n<U+00E9>e]] Durden; [[October 23]], [[1921]]&nbsp;<U+2013> San Francisco, California, [[November 9]], [[2001]]), a hospital administrator, and Jimmy Lee Simpson ([[Arkansas]], [[January 29]], [[1920]]&nbsp;<U+2013> San Francisco, California, [[June 9]], [[1986]]), a [[chef]] and bank custodian.<ref>[http://www.filmreference.com/film/64/O-J-Simpson.html O.

Simpson has one brother, Melvin Leon "Truman" Simpson, and two sisters, Shirley Simpson-Baker and Carmelita Simpson-Durio. As a child, Simpson contracted [[rickets]] and wore braces on his legs until the age of five.<ref>http://www.cnn.com/US/OJ/suspect/bio/index.html CNN-A timeline of O.J. Simpson's life</ref>

At [[Galileo High School]] in San Francisco, Simpson played for the school football team, the Galileo Lions. From 1965 to 1966, Simpson was a student at [[City College of San Francisco]], a member of the California [[community college|Community Colleges]] system. He played both offense ([[running back]]) and defense ([[defensive back]]) and was named to the Junior College All American team as a running back.

===University of Southern California===
Simpson earned an [[athletic scholarship]] to the [[University of Southern California]] where he played running back in 1967 and 1968. Simpson led the nation in rushing in 1967 when he ran for 1,451 yards and scored 11 touchdowns. He also led the nation in rushing the next year with 355 carries for 1,709 yards.

In 1967, he starred in the [[1967 USC vs. UCLA football game]] and was a [[Heisman Trophy]] candidate, but he did not win the award. His 64 yard touchdown run in the 4th quarter tied the game, with the PAT the margin of victory. This was the biggest play in what is regarded as one of the [[Game of the Century (college football)|greatest football games of the 20th century]].<ref>Peters, Nick. (1988) ''College Football's Twenty-Five Greatest Teams'': ''[[The Sporting News]]''. Number 9 Southern California Trojans 1967 ISBN 0-89204-281-8</ref>
Another dramatic touchdown in the same game is the subject of the [[Arnold Friberg]] oil painting, ''O.J. Simpson Breaks for Daylight.'' Simpson also won the Walter Camp Award in 1967 and was a two-time consensus [[College Football All-America Team|All-American]].<ref>University of Southern California Football Media Guide&nbsp;<U+2014> PDF copy available at [http://www.usctrojans.com www.usctrojans.com]. Page 125 of the 2006 Edition. USC's ALL-AMERICANS. (Consensus All-American in 1967, Unanimous All-American in 1968)</ref> He also ran in the USC [[4 x 100 metres relay|sprint relay]] quartet that broke the [[world records in athletics|world record]] at the [[NCAA Men's Outdoor Track and Field Championship|NCAA track championships]] in [[Provo, Utah|Provo]], [[Utah]] in June 1967.<ref>

In 1968, he rushed for 1,709 yards and 22 touchdowns, earning the Heisman Trophy, the [[Maxwell Award]], and the [[Walter Camp Award]] that year. He still holds the record for the Heisman's largest margin of victory, defeating the runner-up by 1,750 points. In the [[1969 Rose Bowl]] where #2 USC faced #1 Ohio State, Simpson threw a costly interception and fumbled the ball in a 16-27 loss in his final college game.<ref>Jenkins, Dan&nbsp;<U+2014> Defense And Rex Make A King. Ohio State's Buckeyes came from 10 points behind to win the Rose Bowl and the national championship with a crushing display of excellence that kept USC's offense in hand and its defense dismayed. Sports Illustrated, January 13, 1969</ref>

===NFL===
There was a regular-season game nicknamed for Simpson; it was the "O.J. Bowl", between the [[Philadelphia Eagles]] and the [[Pittsburgh Steelers]], because it was thought the loser would get the first crack at [[1969 NFL Draft|drafting]] him. The Eagles won that game 12-0 (on 4 field goals by [[Sam Baker (American football player)|Sam Baker]]); but it turned out that neither of those teams drafted him.

Simpson was drafted by the [[American Football League|AFL]]'s [[Buffalo Bills]], who got first pick in the 1969 [[draft (sports)|draft]] after finishing 1-12-1 in [[American Football League seasons#1968|1968]]. Early in his [[National Football League|NFL]] career, Simpson struggled on poor Buffalo teams, averaging only 622 yards per season for his first three.

He first rushed for more than 1,000 yards in [[1972 NFL season|1972]], gaining a total of 1,251. In [[1973 NFL season|1973]], Simpson rushed for a then-record 2,003 yards, becoming the first player ever to pass the 2,000-yard mark, and scored 12 touchdowns. Simpson gained more than 1,000 rushing yards for each of his next three seasons.

Simpson's [[1977 NFL Season|1977]] season in Buffalo was cut short by injury. Before the [[1978 NFL Season|1978]] season, the Bills traded Simpson to the [[San Francisco 49ers]] for a second round draft pick, where he played two unremarkable seasons.

Simpson gained 11,236 rushing yards, placing him 2nd on the NFL's all-time rushing list; he now stands at 16th. He was named NFL Player of the Year in 1973, and played in six [[Pro Bowl]]s. Simpson was inducted into the [[Pro Football Hall of Fame]] in 1985, his first year of eligibility.

===Family life===
On [[June 24]], [[1967]] Simpson married Marguerite L. Whitley. Together they had three children: Arnelle L. Simpson (born [[December 4]], [[1968]]), Jason L. Simpson (born [[April 21]], [[1970]]) and Aaren Lashone Simpson (born [[September 24]], [[1977]]). In 1979, Aaren drowned in the family's swimming pool a month before her second birthday. That same year Simpson and Marguerite were divorced.

On [[February 2]], [[1985]], Simpson married [[Nicole Brown Simpson|Nicole Brown]]. They had two children, Sydney Brooke Simpson (born [[October 17]], 1985) and Justin Ryan Simpson (born [[August 6]], [[1988]]), and were divorced in 1992.

Nicole Brown and her friend Ronald Goldman were murdered on [[June 12]], [[1994]]. Simpson was charged in their deaths but acquitted of all criminal charges in a [[O. J. Simpson murder case|now-infamous criminal trial]]. In the unanimous jury findings of a [[civil court]] case in February 1997, Simpson was found liable for the wrongful death of Ronald Goldman and battery of Nicole Brown (in other words the jury found him directly responsible for her death).

===Acting===
Even before his retirement from football and in the NFL, Simpson went on to a successful film career with parts in films such as the television mini-series ''[[Roots (TV miniseries)|Roots]]'', and the dramatic motion pictures'' [[The Cassandra Crossing]]'', ''[[Capricorn One]]'', ''[[The Klansman]]'', ''[[The Towering Inferno]]'', and the comedic ''[[Back to the Beach]]'' and ''[[The Naked Gun]]'' trilogy. In 1979, he started his own film production company Orenthal Productions, which dealt mostly in made-for-TV fare such as the family-oriented ''Goldie and the Boxer'' films with [[Melissa Michaelsen]] and ''Cocaine and Blue Eyes'', the pilot for a proposed detective series on NBC.

Simpson's amiable persona and natural charisma landed him numerous endorsement deals. He was a spokesman for the [[Hertz Corporation|Hertz]] rental car company. He would often be shown running through airports, as if to suggest he was back on the football field. Simpson was also a longtime spokesman for [[Pioneer Chicken]] and owned two franchises, one of which was destroyed during the [[LA riots]], as well as Honeybaked Hams, the pX Corporation, the [[Calistoga Water Company|Calistoga Water Company's]] line of Napa Naturals soft drinks, and he appeared in comic book ads for Dingo shoes.

Besides his acting career, Simpson had stints as a commentator for ''[[Monday Night Football]]'' and ''[[NFL on NBC|The NFL on NBC]]''.<ref>{{cite web|title=History of ABC's Monday Night Football|url=http://espn.go.com/abcsports/mnf/s/2003/0115/1493105.html|publisher=[[ESPN]]|date=2003-01-15|accessdate=2008-03-15}}</ref> He also hosted an episode of ''[[Saturday Night Live]]''.<ref>{{cite episode|title=OJ Simpson/Ashford & Simpson|url=http://www.nbc.com/Saturday_Night_Live/episodes/Show_84.shtml|series=[[Saturday Night Live]]|airdate=1978-02-25|network=[[NBC]]|season=3|number=12}}</ref>

==Legal problems==
===Criminal trial for murder===
{{Main|O. J. Simpson murder case}}
In 1989, Simpson pled [[Nolo contendere|no contest]] to a domestic violence charge and was separated from Nicole Brown, to whom he was paying child support. On [[June 12]], [[1994]] Nicole and her friend [[Ronald Goldman]] were found dead outside Brown's [[condominium]]. Simpson was soon charged with their murders. After failing to turn himself in, he became the object of a low-speed pursuit in a white [[Ford Bronco]] SUV. The pursuit, arrest, and trial were among the most widely publicized in American history. The trial, often characterized as "the trial of the century," culminated on [[October 3]], [[1995]] in a jury verdict of not guilty for the two murders. The verdict was seen live on TV by more than half of the U.S. population, making it one of the most watched events in American TV history. Immediate reaction to the verdict was notable for its division along racial lines: polls showed that most black Americans felt that justice had been served by the "not guilty" verdict, while most white Americans did not.<ref>[http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/latimes/access/21373189.html?dids=21373189:21373189&FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT&date=Oct+08%2C+1995&author=CATHLEEN+DECKER&pub=Los+Angeles+Times+(pre-1997+Fulltext)&desc=THE+TIMES+POLL%3B+Most+in+County+Disagree+With+Simpson+Verdicts Los Angeles Times Poll], 10-8-1995</ref>  O.J. Simpson's defense council include the late [[Johnnie Cochran]] and [[F. Lee Bailey]].

====Civil trial for wrongful death====
On [[February 5]], [[1997]] a civil jury in [[Santa Monica, California|Santa Monica]], [[California]] unanimously found Simpson liable for the [[wrongful death claim|wrongful death]] of Ronald Goldman, battery against Ronald Goldman, and battery against Nicole Brown. The attorney for plaintiff [[Fred Goldman]] (father of Ronald Goldman) was [[Daniel Petrocelli]]. Simpson was ordered to pay [[United States dollar|$]]33,500,000 in damages. However, California law protects [[pension]]s from being used to satisfy judgments, so Simpson was able to continue much of his lifestyle based on his NFL pension. In February 1999 an auction of Simpson's [[Heisman Trophy]] and other belongings netted almost $500,000. The money went to the Goldman family. Simpson's payment for appearing in the video game [[All Pro Football 2K8]] was also seized.

A 2000 ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' article reported that Simpson still made a significant income by signing autographs. He subsequently moved from [[California]] to [[Miami, Florida|Miami]], [[Florida]]. In Florida, a person's residence cannot be seized to collect a debt under most circumstances. The Goldman family also tried to collect Simpson's NFL pension of $22,000 a month but failed to collect any money.<ref>[http://www.courttv.com/casefiles/simpson/ojsimpson.html "Judge Rules Simpson's Mother Can Keep Piano"; CourtTV news; [[November 17]], 2007]</ref>

====Related litigation====
The civil and criminal trials of Simpson were not the only important legal cases that were spawned by the deaths of Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald Goldman on [[June 12]], [[1994]].

*On [[September 5]], [[2006]], Ron Goldman's father took Simpson back to court to obtain control over his "right to publicity" for purposes of satisfying the judgment in the civil court case.<ref name="spending"/> On [[January 4]], [[2007]] a Federal judge issued a restraining order prohibiting Simpson from spending any advance he may have received on a canceled TV and book deal. The matter was dismissed before trial for lack of jurisdiction.<ref name="spending"/> On [[January 19]], [[2007]] a California state judge issued an additional restraining order, ordering Simpson to restrict his spending to "ordinary and necessary living expenses".<ref name="spending"/>

In September, 2007, a group of men allegedly entered a room at the [[Palace Station]] hotel-casino and took sports memorabilia at gunpoint.

By the end of October 2007, all three of Simpson's co-defendants had plea bargained with the [[Clark County, Nevada|Clark County court]]. Walter Alexander and Charles H. Cashmore accepted plea agreements in exchange for reduced charges and his testimony against Simpson and three other co-defendants, including testifying that guns were used in the alleged robbery.<ref>[http://www.cnn.com/2007/US/law/10/15/oj.simpson/index.html http://www.cnn.com/2007/US/law/10/15/oj.simpson/index.html]</ref> Co-defendant Michael McClinton told a Las Vegas judge that he too would plead guilty to reduced charges and testify against Simpson that guns were used in the robbery. After the hearings, the judge decided to take Simpson to trial for the heist.

Simpson's preliminary hearing, to decide whether he would be tried for the charges, occurred on [[November 8]], [[2007]]. He was held over for trial on all 12 counts. Simpson pleaded [[not guilty]] on [[November 29]]. Court officers and attorneys announced on [[May 22]], 2008, that long questionnaires with at least 115 queries will be given to a [[jury]] pool of 400 or more. Prosecutors and defense counsels disagreed on at least 3 questions, and Clark County District Court Judge Jackie Glass scheduled arguments on the [[June 20]] hearing on pretrial motions. Trial was reset from April to [[September 8]], 2008.<ref>[http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5iUNgbOr-2bnpFUX0MiII6je2CkRAD90R36K80 Afp.google.com, 400 jurors could be screened for OJ Simpson trial]</ref>

===Arrest for contacting co-defendant===
In January 2008, Simpson was taken into custody in Florida and flown to Las Vegas where he was jailed for allegedly violating the terms of his bail by attempting to contact Clarence "C.J." Stewart, a co-defendant in a trial in which they are charged with kidnapping, armed robbery, assault with a deadly weapon, burglary, coercion and conspiracy to commit crimes. District Attorney David Roger of Clark County, provided District Court Judge Jackie Glass with data that Simpson had violated terms of bail. The hearing on this bail issue was on [[January 16]], [[2008]]. Clark County District Court Judge Jackie Glass raised Simpson's bail to US$250,000 and ordered that he remain in jail until 15% of the bail, in cash, was paid.<ref>[http://www.hollywoodgrind.com/tag/oj-simpson/ O.J.

==Alleged confession==
Mike Gilbert, a memorabilia dealer, is a former friend of Simpson. Gilbert has written a book titled "How I Helped O.J. Get Away With Murder: The Shocking Inside Story of Violence, Loyalty, Regret and Remorse." He states that Simpson had smoked pot, took a sleeping pill and was drinking beer when he confided at his Brentwood home weeks after his trial what happened the night of June 12, 1994. Simpson said, "If she hadn't opened that door with a knife in her hand...she'd still be alive." This confirmed Gilbert's beliefs that Simpson had confessed. Simpson's current lawyer, Yale Galanter, said none of Gilbert's claims are true and that Gilbert is "a delusional drug addict who needs money. He has fallen on very hard times. He is in trouble with the IRS [Internal Revenue Service]."
