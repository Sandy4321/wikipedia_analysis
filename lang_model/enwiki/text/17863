The '''Giant Rat of Sumatra''' is a fictional giant rat, first mentioned by [[Arthur Conan Doyle]] in a 1924 [[Sherlock Holmes]] story, and later used in works by many other writers.

:''Matilda Briggs was not the name of a young woman, Watson, ... It was a ship which is associated with the giant rat of [[Sumatra]], a story for which the world is not yet prepared.''

How the ship, the mammal, and the [[Sumatra|Indonesian island]] are associated is not specified. There are a number of species of large rats on Sumatra, with one, ''[[Sundamys infraluteus]]'', actually being referred to as the "giant rat of Sumatra",<ref>Bayard Webster, [http://www.nytimes.com/1983/11/01/science/team-dispels-sherlock-holmes-mystery.html "Team Dispels Sherlock Holmes Mystery"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', November 1, 1983.</ref> and another giant rat, of the ''[[Mallomys]]'' family and discovered in 2007 in the [[Foja Mountains]] of [[Papua (province)|Papua]], has also been compared to Holmes's animal.<ref>Patrick J. Lyons, [http://thelede.blogs.nytimes.com/2007/12/17/the-giant-rat-of-sumatra-alive-and-well/ "The Giant Rat of Sumatra, Alive and Well"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', December 17, 2007.</ref> 

Rats commonly colonise [[ship]]s, and so there is an obvious line of speculation.  Holmesianist Alan Saunders has argued that the reference is in fact to events connected with "[[The Adventure of the Dying Detective]]", although he identifies the rat as the [[Large Bamboo Rat]].<ref>[http://web.archive.org/web/20070621175821/http://www.btinternet.com/~alan.catherine/holmes/sumatra.htm The Sumatran Devil<!-- Bot generated title -->]{{dead link|date=November 2012|bot=Legobot}}</ref>
