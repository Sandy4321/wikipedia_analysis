'''Astrid Kirchherr''' (born 20 May 1938) is a [[Germany|German]] [[photographer]] and [[artist]] and is well known for her association with [[The Beatles]] (along with her friends [[Klaus Voormann]] and [[J<U+00FC>rgen Vollmer]]) and her photographs of The Beatles during their Hamburg days.

Kirchherr met artist [[Stuart Sutcliffe]] in the Kaiserkeller bar in [[Hamburg]] in 1960, where he was playing bass with The Beatles, and was later [[engaged]] to him before his death in 1962.

Although Kirchherr admitted she has taken very few photographs since 1967, her early work has been exhibited in Hamburg, [[Bremen]], [[London]], [[Liverpool]], [[New York City]], [[Washington DC]], [[Tokyo]], [[Vienna]], and at the [[Rock 'n' Roll Hall of Fame]]. Kirchherr has published three limited edition books of photographs.

==Early life==
Astrid Kirchherr was born in 1938 in [[Hamburg]], [[Germany]], and is the daughter of a former [[Corporate title|executive]] of the German branch of the [[Ford Motor Company]]. During [[World War II]] she was evacuated to the safety of the [[Baltic Sea]] where she remembered seeing dead bodies on the shore (after the ships [[Cap Arcona]] and the [[SS Deutschland (1923)|SS Deutschland]] had been bombed and sunk) and the destruction in Hamburg when she returned.<ref name="InterviewAstridKirchherrRetrosellers">{{cite web|url=http://www.retrosellers.com/features10.htm |title=An interview with Astrid Kirchherr |first= |last= |publisher=Retrosellers |accessdate=2009-07-12}}</ref>

After her [[graduation]] Kirchherr enrolled in the Meisterschule f<U+00FC>r Mode, Textil, Graphik und Werbung in Hamburg, as she wanted to study [[fashion design]] but demonstrated a talent for black and white photography.<ref name="RedfernsMusicPictureGallery">{{cite web|url=http://web.archive.org/web/20080119124001/http://gallery2.redferns.com/gallery_text/photographer_biographies/astrid_kirchherr_biog.htm |title=Photographers: Astrid Kirchherr |first= |last= |publisher=Redferns Music Picture Gallery |accessdate=2009-07-12}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theater-schwedt.de/idx/info/1073/go/kirchherr/|title=Astrid Kirchherr|work=Happy Birthday Yellow Submarine|language=German|publisher=www.theater-schwedt.de|accessdate=2009-07-11}}</ref> Reinhard Wolf, the school's main photographic tutor, convinced her to switch courses and promised that he would hire her as his assistant when she graduated.<ref>Harry (1997)</ref> Kirchherr worked for Wolf as his assistant from 1959 until 1963.<ref name="Milesp64">  Miles (1997) p64</ref>

In the late 1950s and early 1960s Kirchherr and her art school friends were involved in the European [[existentialist]] movement whose followers were later nicknamed [[Exy|"Exys"]] by [[John Lennon]].<ref name="Spitzp222"> Spitz (2005) p222</ref> In 1995 she told [[BBC Radio Merseyside]]: "Our [[philosophy]] then, because we were only little kids, was wearing black clothes and going around looking moody. Of course, we had a clue who [[Jean Paul Sartre]] was. We got inspired by all the French artists and writers, because that was the closest we could get. England was so far away, and [[United States|America]] was out of the question. So [[France]] was the nearest. So we got all the information from France, and we tried to dress like the French existentialists. ... We wanted to be free, we wanted to be different, and tried to be [[cool (aesthetic)|cool]], as we call it now."<ref name="InterviewBBCLiverpool"> Kirchherr's interview with Spencer Leigh on BBC Radio Merseyside's 500th ''On The Beat'' programme, Saturday 26 August 1995.</ref><ref name="AstridKirchherrquotesPiczo">{{cite web|url=http://astridkirchherr.piczo.com/?g=15644731&cr=3|title=Astrid Kirchherr quotes |first= |last= |publisher=Piczo |accessdate=2009-07-12}}</ref>

==The Beatles==
[[Image:AstridKirchherr.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Print cover featuring an early photo of The Beatles, signed by Astrid Kirchherr.]]
Kirchherr, Voormann, and Vollmer were friends who had all attended the Meisterschule, and shared the same ideas about fashion, culture and music. Voorman became Astrid's boyfriend, and moved into the Kirchherr home, where he had his own room.<ref name="AstridKirchherrbiogPiczo"/> In 1960, after Kirchherr and Vollmer had had an argument with Voormann, he wandered down the [[Reeperbahn]] (in the St.Pauli district of Hamburg) and heard music coming from the [[Kaiserkeller]] club. Voormann walked in and watched a performance by a group called The Beatles.<ref name="KlausVoormannBiographycom">{{cite web|url=http://www.voormann.com/biography |title=Klaus Voormann Biography |first= |last= |publisher=Klaus Voormann |accessdate=2009-07-11}}</ref> Voormann asked Kirchherr and Vollmer to listen to this new music, and after being persuaded to visit the Kaiserkeller (which was in the rough area of the Reeperbahn)<ref name="FreshAirinterviewwithAstrid">{{cite web|url=http://www.npr.org/templates/player/mediaPlayer.html?action=1&t=1&islist=false&id=18112532&m=18112531 |title=<U+2019><U+2019>Fresh Air<U+2019><U+2019> interview with Astrid Kirchherr (15 January 2008) |first= |last= |publisher=[[WHYY-FM]]|accessdate=2009-07-13}}</ref> Kirchherr decided that all she wanted to do was to be as close to The Beatles as she could.<ref name="Milesp61"> Miles (1997) p61</ref> The trio of friends had never heard this new music called [[Rock n' Roll]] before, having previously only listened to [[Trad jazz]], with some [[Nat King Cole]] and [[The Platters]] mixed in.<ref name="Spitzp222"/><ref name="Milesp62">  Miles (1997) p62</ref> The trio then visited the Kaiserkeller almost every night, arriving at 9 o'clock and sitting by the front of the stage.<ref name="Spitzp221"> Spitz (2005) p221</ref> Kirchherr later said: "It was like a merry-go-round in my head, they looked absolutely astonishing... My whole life changed in a couple of minutes. All I wanted was to be with them and to know them."<ref name="Spitzp223"> Spitz (2005) p223</ref>

Kirchherr later said that she, Voormann, and Vollmer felt guilty about being German, and about Germany's recent history. Meeting The Beatles was something very special for her, although she knew that English people would think that she ate sauerkraut, and would comment on her heavy German accent, but they made jokes about it together.<ref name="AstridKirchherrbiogPiczo">{{cite web|url=http://astridkirchherr.piczo.com/?g=15644505&cr=3 |title=Astrid Kirchherr biog |first= |last= |publisher=Piczo |accessdate=2009-07-12}}</ref> Lennon would make sarcastic remarks from the stage, saying "You [[Germans|Krauts]], we won the war," knowing that very few Germans in the audience spoke English, but any English sailors present would roar with laughter.<ref name="FreshAirinterviewwithAstrid"/> 

Sutcliffe was fascinated by the trio, but especially Kirchherr, and thought they looked like "real [[Bohemian style|bohemian]]s". [[Bill Harry]] later said that when Kirchherr walked in, every head would immediately turn her way, and that she always captivated the whole room.<ref name="Spitzp222"/> Sutcliffe wrote to a friend that he could hardly take his eyes off her, and had tried to talk to Kirchherr during the next break, but she had already left the club. This was due to the strict German law at the time which prohibited young people from frequenting bars after 10 o'clock at night.<ref name="Spitzp221"/>

Sutcliffe managed to meet them eventually, and learned that all three had attended the Meisterschule, which was the same type of art college that Lennon and Sutcliffe had attended in Liverpool.<ref name="Spitzp222"/> (Note: Meisterschule f<U+00FC>r Mode, Textil, Grafik und Werbung [Master Craftspeople College

Kirchherr started dating Sutcliffe, although she always remained close friends with Voormann.<ref name="Milesp64"/><ref name="Spitzp224"> Spitz (2005) p224</ref>
[[Image:Rolleicord 1955.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A Rolleicord camera (1955) which Kirchherr used]]
Kirchherr later supplied Sutcliffe and the other Beatles with [[Preludin]], which, when taken with beer, made them feel euphoric and helped to keep them awake until the early hours of the morning. The Beatles had taken Preludin before, but it was only possible at that time to get Preludin with a doctor's [[Medical prescription|prescription]] note, so Kirchherr's mother got them from a local chemist, who supplied them without asking questions.<ref name="Milesp66">  Miles (1997) p66</ref> After meeting Kirchherr, Lennon filled his letters to [[Cynthia Lennon|Cynthia Powell]] (his girlfriend at the time) with "Astrid said this, Astrid did that",<ref name="AstridKirchherrquotesaboutPiczo">{{cite web|url=http://astridkirchherr.piczo.com/?g=15644690&cr=3|title=Quotes about Kirchherr |first= |last= |publisher=Piczo |accessdate=2009-07-12}}</ref> which made Powell jealous, until she read that Sutcliffe was in a relationship with Kirchherr.<ref name="lennonp78">Lennon (2006) p78</ref> When Powell visited Hamburg with Dot Rhone ([[Paul McCartney]]'s girlfriend at the time) in April 1961, they stayed at Kirchherr's house.<ref name="lennonp91"> Lennon (2006) p91</ref> In August 1963, Kirchherr met Lennon and Cynthia in Paris while they both there for a belated [[honeymoon]], as Kirchherr was there with a girlfriend for a few days holiday. The four of them went from wine bar to wine bar, and finally ended up back at Kirchherr's lodgings, where all four fell asleep on Kirchherr's single bed.<ref name="lennonp162-163"> Lennon (2006) pp162-163</ref> 

The Beatles met Kirchherr again in Hamburg in 1966 when they were touring Germany, and Kirchherr gave Lennon the letters he'd written to Sutcliffe in 1961 and 1962. Lennon said it was 'the best present I've had in years'.<ref name="Spitzp614"> Spitz (2005) p614</ref> All of The Beatles wrote many letters to Kirchherr: "I only have a couple from George, which I'll never show anyone, but he wrote so many. So did the others. I probably threw them away. You do that when you're young-you don't think of the future."<ref name="AstridKirchherrquotesPiczo"/> Harrison later asked Kirchherr to arrange the cover of his ''[[Wonderwall Music]]'' album in 1969.<ref name="AstridonLife"/>

===The Beatles Haircut and clothes===
Kirchherr is credited with inventing The Beatles' [[moptop]] haircut although she disagrees, saying: "All that shit people said, that I created their hairstyle, that's rubbish! Lots of German boys had that hairstyle. Stuart had it for a long while and the others copied it. I suppose the most important thing I contributed to them was friendship."<ref name="Badmanp61">Badman (2000) p61</ref><ref name="Spitzp245"> Spitz (2005) p245</ref> In 1995, Kirchherr told BBC Radio Merseyside: "All my friends in art school used to run around with this sort of what you call Beatles haircut. And my boyfriend then, Klaus Voorman, had this hairstyle, and Stuart liked it very very much. He was the first one who really got the nerve to get the [[Brylcreem]] out of his hair and asking me to cut his hair for him. [[Pete Best]] (The Beatles' original drummer) has really curly hair and it wouldn't work."<ref name="InterviewBBCLiverpool"/> Kirchherr says that after she cut Sutcliffe's hair, Harrison asked her to do the same when she was visiting Liverpool, and Lennon and McCartney had their hair cut in the same style while they were in Paris, by Kirchherr's friend, Vollmer, who was living there at the time as an assistant to photographer [[William Klein]].<ref name="FreshAirinterviewwithAstrid"/>

After moving into the Kirchherr family's house, Sutcliffe used to borrow her clothes, as he was the same height as Kirchherr. He wore her leather pants and jackets, collarless jackets, over-sized shirts, and long scarves. He also borrowed a [[corduroy]] suit with no lapels that he wore on stage, which prompted Lennon to sarcastically ask if his mother had lent him the suit.<ref name="FreshAirinterviewwithAstrid"/>

==Stuart Sutcliffe==
{{main|Stuart Sutcliffe}}
Stuart Sutcliffe wrote to friends that he was infatuated with Kirchherr, and asked her friends which colours, films, books and painters she liked, and who she fancied. Best commented that the beginning of their relationship was, "like one of those fairy stories".<ref name="Spitzp225"> Spitz (2005) p225</ref> Kirchherr says that she immediately fell in love with Sutcliffe, and still calls him "The Love of my life".<ref name="FreshAirinterviewwithAstrid"/> Kirchherr and Sutcliffe got engaged in November 1960, and exchanged rings, as is the German custom.<ref name="Milesp65"> Miles (1997) p65</ref> Sutcliffe later wrote to his parents that he was engaged to Kirchherr, which they were shocked to learn, as they thought he would give up his career as an artist,<ref name="Spitzp235">Spitz (2005) p235</ref> although he told Kirchherr that he would like to be an art teacher in London or Germany in the future.<ref name="FreshAirinterviewwithAstrid"/> Sutcliffe later borrowed money from Kirchherr for the airfare to fly back to Liverpool in February 1961, returning to Hamburg in March.<ref name="Spitzp230"> Spitz (2005) p230</ref><ref name="Spitzp242"> Spitz (2005) p242</ref>

Kirchherr and Sutcliffe went to Liverpool in the summer of 1961, as Kirchherr wanted to meet Sutcliffe's family (and to see Liverpool) before their marriage. Everybody was expecting a strange [[beatnik]] artist from Hamburg, but Kirchherr turned up at the Sutcliffe's house at 37 [[Aigburth]] Drive, Liverpool, bearing a single long-stemmed [[orchid]] in her hand as a present, and dressed in a round-necked [[Cashmere wool|cashmere]] sweater and tailored skirt.<ref name="Spitzp278"> Spitz (2005) p278</ref> In 1962, Sutcliffe collapsed in the middle of an art class in Hamburg. He was suffering from intense headaches, and Kirchherr's mother had German doctors perform various checks on him, although they were unable to determine exactly what was causing the headaches. While living at the Kirchherrs' house in Hamburg his condition got worse. On 10 April 1962, Kirchherr's mother phoned her daughter at work and told her Sutcliffe was not feeling well, had been brought back to the house, and an ambulance had been called for.<ref name="FreshAirinterviewwithAstrid"/> Kirchherr rushed home and rode with Sutcliffe in the ambulance, but he died in her arms before it reached the hospital.<ref name="lennonp110"> Lennon (2006) p110</ref> 

Three days later Kirchherr met Lennon, McCartney and Best at the Hamburg airport (they were returning to Hamburg to perform) and told them Sutcliffe had died of a [[brain haemorrhage]].<ref name="Spitzp305"> Spitz (2005) p305</ref> Harrison and manager [[Brian Epstein]] arrived on another plane sometime later with Sutcliffe's mother, who had been informed by telegram.<ref name="FreshAirinterviewwithAstrid"/> Harrison and Lennon were helpful towards the distraught Kirchherr, with Lennon telling her one day that she definitely had to decide if she wanted to "Live or die, there is no other question."<ref name="FreshAirinterviewwithAstrid"/>

==Photography==
In 1964 Kirchherr became a [[freelance]] photographer, and with her colleague Max Scheler she took "behind the scenes" photographs of The Beatles during the filming of "''[[A Hard Day's Night (film)|A Hard Day's Night]]''", as an assignment for the German ''[[Stern (magazine)|Stern]]'' magazine.<ref name="AstridKirchherrRockstorebiog">{{cite web|url=http://www.rockstore.net/Merchant/subpages/astrid.html |title=Astrid Kirchherr <U+2013> Rockstore biog |first= |last= |publisher=Rockstore |accessdate=2009-07-11}}</ref> Epstein had forbidden any publicity photographs to be taken without his permission, but Kirchherr phoned Harrison, who said he would arrange it, but added, "Only if they pay you."<ref name="FreshAirinterviewwithAstrid"/>

[[File:St George's Hall, Liverpool2.jpg|250px|right|thumb|St. George's Hall, Liverpool. Kirchherr took photographs of Liverpool groups as they stood on the front steps]]
''Stern'' phoned [[Bill Harry]] at his [[Mersey Beat]] newspaper and asked if he could arrange a photograph of all the groups in Liverpool,<ref name="PhotographsofMaxSchelerAstrid Kirchherr">{{cite web|url=http://www.genesis-publications.com/fame/liverpool.html |title=Liverpool Days: The Photographs of Max Scheler And Astrid Kirchherr |first= |last= |publisher=Genesis Publications |accessdate=2009-07-11}}</ref> so Harry suggested Kirchherr be the photographer, although Kirchherr later said she placed an advetisement in the Liverpool Echo newspaper.<ref name="FreshAirinterviewwithAstrid"/> Kirchherr and Scheler said that any group who wanted their photograph taken in front of [[St. George's Hall, Liverpool|St. George's Hall]] would be paid <U+00A3>1 per musician,<ref name="AstridKirchherrBeatlesPhotographerInterviewed"/> but over 200 groups turned up on the day, which meant Kirchherr and Scheler soon ran out of money.<ref name="InterviewBBCLiverpool"/><ref name="ThephotographsMaxSchelerAstrid Kirchherr">{{cite web|url=http://www.genesis-publications.com/fame/liverpool.html |title=Liverpool days: The photographs of Max Scheler and Astrid Kirchherr |first= |last= |publisher=Genesis publications |accessdate=2009-07-12}}</ref> Kirchherr didn't publish the photographs until 1995, in a book called ''Liverpool Days'', which is a limited edition collection of black-and-white photographs.<ref name="InterviewBBCLiverpool"/> In 1999, a companion book called ''Hamburg Days'' was published (a two-volume limited edition) containing a set of photographs by Kirchherr and "memory drawings" by Voormann. The drawings are recollections of places and situations that Voormann clearly remembers, but Kirchherr had never photographed, or had lost the photographs.<ref name="HamburgDays">{{cite web|url=http://www.genesis-publications.com/books/ham/index.html |title=Hamburg Days|first= |last= |publisher=Genesis publications |accessdate=2009-07-12}}</ref> 

Kirchherr described how difficult it was to be accepted as a female photographer in the 1960s: "Every magazine and newspaper wanted me to photograph The Beatles again. Or they wanted my old stuff, even if it was out of focus, whether they were nice or not. They wouldn't look at my other work. It was very hard for a girl photographer in the 60s to be accepted. In the end I gave up. I've hardly taken a photo since 1967.<ref name="AstridonLife">{{cite web|url=http://www.center-of-beat.com/en_ak.php |title=Astrid Kirchherr K&K biog |first= |last= |publisher=Center of Beat |accessdate=2009-07-12}}</ref>" Kirchherr was quoted as saying that ''When We Was Fab'' ([[Genesis Publications]] 2007) would be her last book of photographs: "I have decided it is time to create one book in which I am totally involved so that it contains the pictures I like most, printed the way I would print them, even down to the text and design.... This book is me and that is why it will be the last one. The very last one."<ref name="WhenWeWasFab">{{cite web|url=http://www.genesis-publications.com/books/fab/index.html |title=When We Was Fab |first= |last= |publisher=Genesis publications |accessdate=2009-07-12}}</ref>

Kirchherr has expressed respect for other photographers, such as [[Annie Leibovitz]] (because of the humour in her work) [[Irving Penn]], [[Richard Avedon]], Jim Rakete and Reinhard Wolf (German Wikipedia) and French film-makers [[Fran<U+00E7>ois Truffaut]], and [[Jean Cocteau]].<ref name="InterviewAstridKirchherrRetrosellers"/> Kirchherr said that her favourite photos are the ones she took of Sutcliffe by the Baltic sea, and of Lennon and George Harrison in her attic room at 45a Eimsb<U+00FC>tteler Strasse. She has expressed reservations about digital photography, saying that a photographer should concentrate on the art of photography and not on the technical results, although admitting that she knows nothing about computers, and is "afraid of the internet".<ref name="InterviewAstridKirchherrRetrosellers"/>

Kirchherr admits that she is not good at business as she is not organised enough, and has never really looked after the negatives of her photographs to prove ownership.<ref name="AstridonLife"/> Her business partner Ulf Kr<U+00FC>ger<U+2014>a songwriter and record producer<U+2014>successfully found many of Astrid's negatives and photographs and had them copyrighted, although he believes that Kirchherr has lost <U+00A3>500,000 over the years because of people using her photographs without permission.<ref name="AstridKirchherrBeatlesPhotographerInterviewed"/><ref name="AstridonLife"/> In July 2001 Kirchherr visited Liverpool to open an exhibition of her work at the [[Mathew Street]] art gallery, which is close to the former site of [[The Cavern Club]].<ref name="MerseysideGalleries">{{cite web|url=http://www.merseyguide.co.uk/galleries_page.htm |title=Galleries: Mathew Street Gallery |first= |last= |publisher=Merseyside |accessdate=2009-07-12}}</ref> She appeared as a guest at the city's Beatles Week Festival during the [[August Bank Holiday]].<ref name="FabFourphotographersdisplay">{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/1435450.stm |title=Fab Four photographer's display |first= |last= |publisher=BBC |accessdate=2009-07-11}}</ref> Kirchherr's work has been exhibited internationally in places, such as Hamburg, Bremen, London, Liverpool, New York City, Washington, D.C., Tokyo, Vienna, and at the Rock 'n' Roll Hall of Fame.<ref name="AstridKirchherrRockstorebiog"/>

==Later life to present==
In 1967, Kirchherr married English drummer Gibson Kemp, who had replaced [[Ringo Starr]] in [[Rory Storm and the Hurricanes]]. The marriage ended in divorce after seven years.<ref name="Spitzp222"/> She worked as a barmaid, an interior designer, and then worked for a music publishing firm,<ref name="AstridKirchherrBeatlesPhotographerInterviewed"/> getting married for a second time to a German businessman.<ref name="FreshAirinterviewwithAstrid"/> 
Kirchherr worked as an advisor, in 1994, on the film ''[[Backbeat (film)|Backbeat]]'', which portrayed Kirchherr, Sutcliffe and The Beatles during their early days in Hamburg.<ref name="InterviewBBCLiverpool"/> She was impressed with [[Stephen Dorff]] (who played Sutcliffe in the film) commenting that he was the right age (19-years-old at the time)
and his gestures, the way he smoked, and talked were so like Sutcliffe's that she had [[goose pimples]]. Kirchherr was portrayed in the film by actress [[Sheryl Lee]].<ref name="AstridonLife"/> 

Since the mid-1990s Kirchherr and Kr<U+00FC>ger have operated the K&K photography shop in Hamburg, offering custom vintage prints, books and artwork for sale. K&K periodically helps arrange Beatles' conventions and other Beatles' events in the Hamburg area.<ref name="News&Newsletter">{{cite web|url=http://center-of-beat.com/en_news.php |title=News & Newsletter |first= |last= |publisher=K&K Center of Beat |accessdate=2009-07-11}}</ref> She has no children, and now lives alone: ""My [second] marriage ended in 1985... I regretted I had no children. I just couldn't see me have [sic] any. But now I am pleased when I see the situation the world is in. I live alone and am very happy."<ref name="AstridKirchherrquotesPiczo"/>
