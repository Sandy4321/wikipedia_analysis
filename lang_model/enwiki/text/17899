'''"Mr. Tambourine Man"''' is a song written, composed, and performed by [[Bob Dylan]], who released his original version of it on his 1965 album ''[[Bringing It All Back Home]].'' [[The Byrds]] also recorded a version of the song that they released in the same year as their first [[Single (music)|single]] on [[Columbia Records]], reaching number 1 on both the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] chart and the [[UK Singles Chart]], as well as being the title track of their first album, ''[[Mr. Tambourine Man (album)|Mr. Tambourine Man]].'' The Byrds' recording of the song was influential in initiating the musical subgenre of [[folk rock]], leading many contemporary bands to mimic its fusion of jangly guitars and intellectual lyrics in the wake of the single's success.  

This song has been covered by many artists, including [[Judy Collins]], [[Odetta]], [[Melanie Safka|Melanie]], and [[William Shatner]]. The song's popularity led to Dylan recording it live many times, and it has been included in multiple Dylan and Byrds [[compilation album]]s. It has been translated into other languages, and has been used or referenced in television shows, films and books.

The song has a bright, expansive melody and has become famous in particular for its surrealistic imagery, influenced by artists as diverse as French poet [[Arthur Rimbaud]] and Italian filmmaker [[Federico Fellini]]. The lyrics call on the title character to play a song and the narrator will follow. Interpretations of the lyrics have included a [[paean]] to drugs such as [[Lysergic acid diethylamide|LSD]], a call to the singer's [[muse]], a reflection of the audience's demands on the singer, and religious interpretations. Dylan sings the song in four verses, of which The Byrds used only the second for their recording. Dylan's and The Byrds' versions have appeared on various lists ranking the greatest songs of all time, including an appearance by both on ''[[Rolling Stone]]'s'' list of the [[Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Songs of All Time|500 best songs ever]]. Both versions also received [[Grammy Hall of Fame Award]]s.

===Composition and recording===
"Mr. Tambourine Man" was written and composed in early 1964, at the same approximate time as "[[Chimes of Freedom (song)|Chimes of Freedom]]," which Dylan recorded later that spring for his album ''[[Another Side of Bob Dylan]].''<ref name=heylin>{{harvnb|Heylin|2009|pp=181<U+2013>186}}</ref><ref name=rough>{{harvnb|Williamson|2006|pp=223<U+2013>224}}</ref> Dylan began writing and composing "Mr. Tambourine Man" in February 1964, after attending [[Mardi Gras]] in [[New Orleans]] during a cross-country road trip with several friends, and completed it sometime between the middle of March and late April of that year after he had returned to New York.<ref name=heylin/> Nigel Williamson has suggested in ''The Rough Guide to Bob Dylan'' that the influence of Mardi Gras can be heard in the swirling and fanciful imagery of the song's lyrics.<ref>{{harvnb|Williamson|2006|p=268}}</ref> Journalist [[Al Aronowitz]] has claimed that Dylan completed the song at his home, but [[folk music|folk singer]] [[Judy Collins]], who later covered the song, has stated that Dylan completed the song at her home.<ref name=heylin/> Dylan premiered the song the following month at a May 17 concert at London's [[Royal Festival Hall]].<ref name=heylin/>

Dylan first recorded "Mr. Tambourine Man" a few weeks later, on June 9, with [[Tom Wilson (producer)|Tom Wilson]] [[Record producer|producing]], during the ''Another Side of Bob Dylan'' session.<ref name=heylin/><ref>{{harvnb|Heylin|1995|p=29}}</ref> The [[Take#Music|take]], recorded with [[Ramblin' Jack Elliott]], was cut from the album because Dylan felt the song was special and their performance did not do it justice.<ref name=heylin/> Sometime that month he also recorded a publisher demo of the song at Witmark Music.<ref>{{harvnb|Heylin|1995|pp=20, 29}}</ref> More than six months passed before Dylan re-recorded the song, again with Wilson in the producer's chair, during the final ''Bringing It All Back Home'' session on January 15, 1965, the same day that "[[Gates of Eden]]," "[[It's Alright, Ma (I'm Only Bleeding)]]," and "[[It's All Over Now, Baby Blue]]" were recorded.<ref name=heylin/><ref>{{harvnb|Heylin|2002|pp=104<U+2013>106}}</ref> It was long thought that the four songs were each recorded in one long take.<ref name=albums>{{harvnb|Varesi|2002|pp=51<U+2013>53}}</ref> However, in the biography ''Bob Dylan: Behind the Shades,'' Clinton Heylin relates that the song required six attempts, possibly because of difficulties in working out the playoffs between Dylan's [[steel-string acoustic guitar|acoustic guitar]] and [[Bruce Langhorne]]'s electric lead.<ref name=heylin/> The final take was selected for the album, which was released on March 22, 1965.<ref name=heylin/><ref name=albums/>  

In his book ''Keys to the Rain: The Definitive Bob Dylan Encyclopedia,'' Oliver Trager describes "Mr. Tambourine Man" as having a bright, expansive melody,<ref name=keys>{{harvnb|Trager|2004|pp=438<U+2013>441}}</ref> with Langhorne's electric guitar accompaniment, which provides a [[countermelody]] to the vocals, being the only instrumentation besides Dylan's acoustic guitar and [[harmonica]].<ref name=gill>{{harvnb|Gill|1998|pp=74<U+2013>75}}</ref> Author Wilfred Mellers has noted that although the song is in the [[key (music)|key]] of [[D major]], it is [[harmony|harmonized]] as if it were in a [[Lydian mode|Lydian]] [[G major]], giving the song a tonal ambiguity that enhances the dreamy quality of the melody.<ref name=mellers>{{harvnb|Mellers|1984|pp=136<U+2013>138}}</ref> Unusually, rather than beginning with the first verse, the song begins with an iteration of the chorus:<ref name=keys/>  

:''Hey! Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me,
:''I'm not sleepy and there is no place I'm going to.
:''Hey! Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me,
:''In the jingle-jangle morning I'll come following you.<ref>{{harvnb|Dylan|2006|pp=152<U+2013>153}}</ref>

William Ruhlmann, writing for the [[Allmusic]] website, has suggested the following interpretation of the song's lyrics: "The time seems to be early morning following a night when the narrator has not slept. Still unable to sleep, though amazed by his weariness, he is available and open to Mr. Tambourine Man's song, and says he will follow him. In the course of four verses studded with internal rhymes, he expounds on this situation, his meaning often heavily embroidered with imagery, though the desire to be freed by the tambourine man's song remains clear."<ref name=allmusic1>{{harvnb|Ruhlmann}}</ref>

There has been speculation that the song is about drugs such as [[Lysergic acid diethylamide|LSD]] or [[Cannabis (drug)|marijuana]], particularly with lines such as "take me on a trip upon your magic swirling ship" and "the smoke rings of my mind."<ref name=heylin/><ref name=rough/><ref name=gill/> Dylan has always denied the song is about drugs,{{sfn|Gilliland|1969|loc=show 32, track 2}} and though he was using marijuana at the time the song was written, he was not introduced to LSD until a few months later.<ref name=heylin/><ref name=rough/><ref name=prophet>{{harvnb|Rogovoy|2009|pp=81<U+2013>82}}</ref> Other commentators have interpreted the song as a call to the singer's spirit or [[muse]], or the singer's search for transcendence.<ref name=rough/><ref name=prophet/><ref name=hinchey>{{harvnb|Hinchey|2002|pp=94<U+2013>99}}</ref><ref name=williams1>{{harvnb|Williams|1990|pp=128<U+2013>133}}</ref><ref name=shelton>{{harvnb|Shelton|1997|pp=274<U+2013>275}}</ref> In particular, biographer John Hinchey has suggested in his book ''Like a Complete Unknown'' that the singer is praying to his muse for inspiration; Hinchey notes that ironically the song itself is evidence the muse has already provided the sought-after inspiration.<ref name=hinchey/> Mr. Tambourine Man has also been interpreted as a symbol for [[Jesus Christ]] and for the [[Pied Piper of Hamelin]].<ref name=allmusic1/> The song may also reference [[gospel music]], with Mr. Tambourine Man being the bringer of religious salvation.<ref name=shelton/>

Dylan has cited the influence of [[Federico Fellini]]'s movie ''[[La strada]]'' on the song,<ref name=keys/><ref name=sounes>{{harvnb|Sounes|2001|p=182}}</ref> while other commentators have found echoes of the poetry of [[Arthur Rimbaud]].<ref name=heylin/><ref>Tamarin, Jean, "Bringing It All Back Home", in {{harvnb|Dettmar|2009|p=135}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Heylin|2002|p=151}}</ref> Author Howard Sounes has identified the lyrics "in the jingle jangle morning I'll come following you" as having been taken from a [[Lord Buckley]] recording.<ref name=sounes/> [[Bruce Langhorne]], who performs guitar on the track, has been cited by Dylan as the inspiration for the tambourine man image in the song.<ref name=keys/> Langhorne used to play a giant, four-inch-deep "[[tambourine]]" (actually a Turkish frame drum), and had brought the instrument to a previous Dylan recording session.<ref name=heylin/><ref name=gill/><ref>{{harvnb|Unterberger (1)}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Unterberger (2)}}</ref>

===Release and the birth of folk rock===
[[File:TheByrds.jpg|right|thumb|300px|The Byrds performing "Mr. Tambourine Man" on [[The Ed Sullivan Show]], December 12, 1965.]]
"Mr. Tambourine Man" was the debut single by the American band The Byrds and was released on April 12, 1965 by Columbia Records.<ref>{{harvnb|Eder|1990}}</ref> The song was also the title track of the band's debut album, ''[[Mr. Tambourine Man (album)|Mr. Tambourine Man]],'' which was released on June 21, 1965.<ref>{{harvnb|Rogan|1998|p=545}}</ref> The single, along with the album of the same name, was influential in originating the musical style known as [[folk rock]], with the single becoming the first folk rock smash hit.<ref>{{harvnb|Rogan|1996}}</ref><ref name=allbyrds>{{harvnb|Unterberger (4)}}</ref> Indeed, the term "folk rock" was first coined by the U.S [[Music journalism|music press]] to describe the band's sound at around the same time as "Mr. Tambourine Man" peaked at number 1 on the ''Billboard'' chart.<ref>{{harvnb|Rogan|1998|pp=81<U+2013>83}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Unterberger|2002|p=133}}</ref> 

The single initiated the folk rock boom of 1965 and 1966, with many acts imitating the band's hybrid of a rock beat, jangly guitar playing and poetic or socially conscious lyrics.<ref name=allmusic1/><ref name=folkrock>{{harvnb|Folk-Rock}}</ref> This hybrid had its antecedents in the [[American folk music revival|American folk revival]] of the early 1960s,<ref>{{harvnb|1962-66: American Folk-Rock vs. The British Invasion}}</ref> [[The Animals]]'s rock-oriented recording of the [[Folk music|folk song]] "[[The House of the Rising Sun]],"<ref>{{harvnb|Unterberger|2002|pp=93<U+2013>96}}</ref> the folk-influences present in the songwriting of [[The Beatles]],<ref>{{harvnb|Unterberger|2002|p=88}}</ref> and the [[twelve-string guitar]] jangle of [[The Searchers (band)|The Searchers]] and The Beatles's [[George Harrison]].<ref>{{harvnb|Wadhams|2001|p=194}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Eder}}</ref> However, it was The Byrds who first melded these disparate elements into a unified whole, creating a template for folk rock that would prove successful for many acts during the mid-1960s.<ref name=allmusic1/><ref name=unterberger>{{harvnb|Unterberger (5)}}</ref>

Most of the members of The Byrds had a background in folk music,<ref name=allbyrds/> since [[Roger McGuinn|Jim McGuinn]], as he was then known, [[Gene Clark]], and [[David Crosby]] had all worked as folk singers during the early 1960s.<ref name=hjort1>{{harvnb|Hjort|2008|p=11}}</ref><ref name=hjort2>{{harvnb|Hjort|2008|pp=14<U+2013>21}}</ref> They had also spent time, independently of each other, in various folk groups, including [[The New Christy Minstrels]], [[The Limeliters]], [[Chad Mitchell Trio|The Chad Mitchell Trio]], and [[Les Baxter|Les Baxter's Balladeers]].<ref name=hjort1/><ref>{{harvnb|Russel}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Musicians Associated With The Byrds: The New Christy Minstrels}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|David Crosby}}</ref> In early 1964, McGuinn, Clark and Crosby formed The Jet Set and started developing a fusion of folk-based lyrics and melodies, with [[arrangement]]s in the style of The Beatles.<ref name=hjort2/><ref>{{harvnb|Rogan|1998|pp=31, 35<U+2013>36}}</ref> In August 1964, the band's manager Jim Dickson acquired an [[acetate disc]] of "Mr. Tambourine Man" from Dylan's [[Music publisher (popular music)|publisher]], featuring a performance by Dylan and Ramblin' Jack Elliott.<ref name=heylin/><ref name=hjort2/>{{sfn|Gilliland|1969|loc=show 33, track 2}}<ref name="timeless2">{{harvnb|Rogan|1998|pp=49<U+2013>63}}</ref> Although the band members were initially unimpressed with the song, they eventually agreed to begin rehearsing and [[Demo (music)|demoing]] it.<ref name=creswell>{{harvnb|Creswell|2006|p=59}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Fricke|2001}}</ref> In an attempt to make it sound more like The Beatles, the band and Dickson elected to give the song a full, electric [[Rock music|rock]] band treatment, effectively creating the musical subgenre of folk rock.<ref name=allbyrds/><ref name="timeless2"/><ref name=creswell/> To further bolster the group's confidence in the song, Dickson invited Dylan to hear the band's rendition.<ref name=timeless3>{{harvnb|Rogan|1998|pp=54<U+2013>56}}</ref> Dylan was impressed, enthusiastically commenting, "Wow, you can dance to that!"

===Production===
The master take of "Mr. Tambourine Man" was recorded on January 20, 1965, at Columbia Studios in Hollywood, prior to the release of Dylan's own version.<ref>{{harvnb|Hjort|2008|p=24}}</ref> The song's jangling, melodic guitar playing (performed by McGuinn on a [[Twelve-string guitar|12-string]] [[Rickenbacker]] guitar) was immediately influential and has remained so to the present day.<ref name="timeless2"/> The group's complex [[Vocal harmony|harmony]] work, as featured on "Mr. Tambourine Man," became another major characteristic of their sound.<ref>{{harvnb|Mr. Tambourine Man}}</ref> Due to producer [[Terry Melcher]]'s{{sfn|Gilliland|1969|loc=show 33, track 2}} initial lack of confidence in The Byrds' musicianship, McGuinn was the only Byrd to play on both "Mr. Tambourine Man" and its [[A-Side and B-Side|B-side]], "[[I Knew I'd Want You]]."<ref name="timeless2"/> Rather than using band members, Melcher hired [[The Wrecking Crew (music)|The Wrecking Crew]], a collection of top L.A. [[session musician]]s, who (with McGuinn on guitar) provided the backing track over which McGuinn, Crosby, and Clark sang.<ref>{{harvnb|Fricke|1996}}</ref> By the time the sessions for their debut album began in March 1965, however, Melcher was satisfied that the band was competent enough to record its own musical backing.<ref name=allbyrds/> Much of the track's arrangement and final [[mixdown]] was modeled after [[Brian Wilson]]'s production work for [[the Beach Boys]]' "[[Don't Worry Baby]]".<ref>{{cite book|last=Beckwith|first=Harry|title=The Invisible Touch: The Four Keys to Modern Marketing|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=D9x11iryNAUC&pg=PT55|date=15 January 2001|publisher=Grand Central Publishing|isbn=978-0-7595-2094-3|pages=55<U+2013>}}</ref><ref >{{cite book|last=Howard|first=David N.|title=Sonic Alchemy: Visionary Music Producers and Their Maverick Recordings|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=qXhwR_2Ka2UC&pg=PA61|year=2004|publisher=Hal Leonard Corporation|isbn=978-0-634-05560-7|pages=61<U+2013>}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Dillon|first=Mark|title=Fifty Sides of the Beach Boys: The Songs That Tell Their Story|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=QAP0yVAVq3YC&pg=PT83|date=1 January 2012|publisher=ECW Press|isbn=978-1-77090-198-8|pages=83<U+2013>}}</ref>

The Byrds' recording of the song opens with a distinctive, [[Johann Sebastian Bach|Bach]]-inspired guitar [[Introduction (music)|introduction]] played by McGuinn and then, like Dylan's version, goes into the song's [[Refrain|chorus]].<ref name="timeless2"/> Although Dylan's version contains four verses, The Byrds only perform the song's second verse and two repeats of the chorus, followed by a variation on the song's introduction, which then [[Fade (audio engineering)|fades out]].<ref name=allmusic1/> The Byrds' arrangement of the song had been shortened during the band's rehearsals at [[Pacific Jazz Records|World Pacific Studios]] in 1964, at the suggestion of Jim Dickson, in order to accommodate commercial [[radio]] stations, which were reluctant to play songs that were over two-and-a-half minutes long.<ref name="timeless2"/><ref name=creswell/> Thus, while Dylan's version is five-and-a-half minutes long, The Byrds' runs just short of two-and-a-half minutes.<ref name=allmusic1/> The [[lead vocal]] on The Byrds' version of "Mr. Tambourine Man" was sung by McGuinn, who attempted to modify his singing style to fill what he perceived as a gap in the popular music scene of the day, somewhere between the vocal sound of [[John Lennon]] and Bob Dylan.<ref name="timeless2"/> The song also took on a spiritual aspect for McGuinn during the recording sessions, as he told The Byrds' biographer [[Johnny Rogan]] in 1997: "I was singing to God and I was saying that God was the Tambourine Man and I was saying to him, 'Hey, God, take me for a trip and I'll follow you.' It was a prayer of submission."<ref name="timeless2"/>

===Reception===
