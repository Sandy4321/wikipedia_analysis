The '''Italian War of 1521<U+2013>26''', sometimes known as the '''Four Years' War''',<ref>The name refers to the four years between the beginning of hostilities in 1521 and the Battle of Pavia in 1525, although the war did not formally end until 1526.</ref> was a part of the [[Italian Wars]].  The war pitted [[Francis I of France]] and the [[Republic of Venice]] against the [[Holy Roman Emperor]] [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]], [[Henry VIII of England]], and the [[Papal States]].  The conflict arose from animosity over the election of Charles as Emperor in 1519<U+2013>20 and from [[Pope Leo X]]'s need to ally with Charles against [[Martin Luther]].

The war broke out across western Europe late in 1521 when the French invaded [[Navarre]] and the [[Low Countries]].  Imperial forces overcame the invasion and attacked northern France, where they were stopped in turn.  The Pope, the Emperor, and Henry VIII then signed a formal alliance against France, and hostilities began on the Italian peninsula.  At the [[Battle of Bicocca]], Imperial and Papal forces defeated the French, driving them from [[Lombardy]].  Following the battle, fighting again spilled onto French soil, while Venice made a separate peace.  The English invaded France in 1523, while [[Charles de Bourbon]], alienated by Francis's attempts to seize his inheritance, betrayed Francis and allied himself with the Emperor.  A French attempt to regain Lombardy in 1524 failed and provided Bourbon with an opportunity to invade [[Provence]] at the head of a Spanish army.  

Francis himself led a second attack on [[Milan]] in 1525.  While he was initially successful in driving back the Spanish and Imperial forces, his disastrous defeat at the [[Battle of Pavia]], where he was captured and many of his chief nobles were killed, led to the end of the war.  While imprisoned in Spain, Francis signed the Treaty of Madrid, surrendering his claims to Italy, [[Flanders]], and [[Burgundy]].  Only a few weeks after his release, however, he repudiated the terms of the treaty, starting the [[War of the League of Cognac]].  Although the Italian Wars would continue for another three decades, they would end with France having failed to regain any substantial territories in Italy.

== Prelude ==

By 1518, the peace that had prevailed in Europe after the [[Battle of Marignano]] was beginning to crumble.  The major powers (France, England, Spain, and the Holy Roman Empire) were outwardly friendly, pledging by the Treaty of London to come to the aid of any of the signatories that was attacked and to combine against any nation that broke the peace.  They were divided, however, on the question of the Imperial succession.  The [[Holy Roman Emperor]], [[Maximilian I]], intending for a [[Habsburg]] to succeed him, began to campaign on behalf of [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles of Spain]], while  Francis put himself forward as an alternate candidate.  At the same time, the Papacy and the Holy Roman Empire were forced to deal with the rising influence of [[Martin Luther]], who found support among opportunistic Imperial nobles, while Francis was faced with [[Thomas Cardinal Wolsey]], who interposed himself into the quarrels of the continent in an attempt to increase both England's influence and his own.

[[Image:European dominions of Charles V (1519).jpg|thumb|left|250px|The territories controlled by Charles V in 1519.]]

Maximilian's death in 1519 brought the Imperial election to the forefront of European politics.  [[Pope Leo X]], threatened by the presence of Spanish troops a mere forty miles from the Vatican, supported the French candidacy.<ref>Hackett, ''Francis the First'', 205.</ref>  The [[prince-elector]]s themselves, with the exception of [[Frederick of Saxony]], who refused to countenance the campaigning, promised their support to both candidates at once.  Before his death, Maximilian had already promised sums of 500,000 florins to the Electors in exchange for their votes, but Francis offered up to three million, and Charles retaliated by borrowing vast sums from the [[Fuggers]].<ref>Hackett, ''Francis the First'', 206.</ref>  The final outcome, however, was not determined by the exorbitant bribes, which included Leo promising to make the [[Archbishop of Mainz]] his permanent [[papal legate|legate]].<ref>Hackett, ''Francis the First'', 205<U+2013>207.</ref>  The general outrage of the populace at the idea of a French Emperor gave the Electors pause, and when Charles put an army in the field near [[Frankfurt]], where they were meeting, the Electors obligingly voted for him.<ref>Guicciardini, ''History of Italy'', 316<U+2013>318.</ref>  He was crowned [[Holy Roman Emperor]] on [[October 23]], [[1520]], by which point he already controlled both the Spanish crown and the hereditary Burgundian lands in the [[Low Countries]].

[[Thomas Cardinal Wolsey]], hoping to increase Henry VIII's influence on the continent, offered the services of England as a mediator for the various disputes between Francis and Charles.  Henry and Francis staged an extravagant meeting at the [[Field of the Cloth of Gold]]. Immediately afterwards, Wolsey entertained Charles in [[Calais]].<ref>Hackett, ''Francis the First'', 213<U+2013>218.</ref>  Following the meetings, Wolsey, concerned mainly with improving his own stature in preparation for the next [[papal conclave]], proceeded to stage a hollow arbitration conference at Calais, which lasted until April 1522 to no practical effect.

[[Image:Francis1-1.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Francis I of France]], painted by [[Jean Clouet]].  Francis, stymied in his ambition to become Holy Roman Emperor, pushed Europe into war.]]

In December, the French began to plan for war.  Francis did not wish to openly attack Charles because Henry had announced his intention to intervene against the first party to break the tenuous peace.  Instead, he turned to more covert support for incursions into Imperial and Spanish territory.  One attack would be made on the [[Meuse River]], under the leadership of [[Robert de la Marck]].  Simultaneously, another army would invade [[Navarre]]; nominally conducted by [[Henry d'Albret]], who had lost the principality to [[Ferdinand II of Aragon]] in 1512, the invasion was effectively commanded by Lesparre (the brother of [[Odet de Foix, Vicomte de Lautrec]]).  The operations were to be funded and equipped by the French, who denied all responsibility.<ref>Blockmans, ''Emperor Charles V'', 51<U+2013>52; Hackett, ''Francis the First'', 226.</ref>  The French designs quickly proved flawed as the intervention of [[Henry of Nassau]] drove back the Meuse offensive; and although Lesparre was initially successful in [[Battle of Pampeluna|seizing Pamplona]], he was driven from Navarre after being defeated at the [[Battle of Esquiroz]] on [[June 30]], [[1521]].<ref>Hackett, ''Francis the First'', 226; Oman, ''Art of War'', 173<U+2013>174.</ref>

Charles was meanwhile preoccupied with the issue of [[Martin Luther]], whom he confronted at the [[Diet of Worms]] in March 1521.  The Emperor, who did not know German, viewed [[Catholicism]] as a natural way of binding the diverse principalities of the Holy Roman Empire to him.  Since Pope [[Leo X]], for his part, was unwilling to tolerate such open defiance of his own authority, he and the Emperor were forced to support one another against Luther, who was now backed by Frederick of Saxony and [[Franz von Sickingen]].<ref>Hackett, ''Francis the First'', 226<U+2013>227.</ref>  On [[May 25]], Charles and Cardinal [[Girolamo Aleandro]], the Papal [[nuncio]], proclaimed the [[Edict of Worms]] against Luther.  Simultaneously, the Emperor promised the Pope the restoration of [[Parma]] and [[Piacenza]] to the Medici and of Milan to the [[Sforza]]. Leo, needing the Imperial mandate for his campaign against what he viewed as a dangerous heresy, promised to assist in expelling the French from Lombardy, leaving Francis with only the [[Republic of Venice]] for an ally.<ref>Hackett, ''Francis the First'', 227<U+2013>228.</ref>

== Initial moves (1521<U+2013>22) ==

In June, Imperial armies under [[Henry of Nassau]] invaded north-eastern France, razing the cities of [[Ardres]] and [[Mouzon]] and [[Siege of Tournai|besieging Tournai]].  They were delayed by the dogged resistance of the French, led by [[Pierre Terrail, Seigneur de Bayard]] and [[Anne de Montmorency]], during the [[Siege of Mezieres]], which gave Francis time to gather an army to confront the attack.<ref>Blockmans, ''Emperor Charles V'', 51<U+2013>52; Hackett, ''Francis the First'', 243.</ref>  On [[October 22]], [[1521]], Francis encountered the main Imperial army, which was commanded by Charles V himself, near [[Valenciennes]].  Despite the urging of [[Charles de Bourbon]], Francis hesitated to attack, which allowed Charles time to retreat.  When the French were finally ready to advance, the start of heavy rains prevented an effective pursuit and the Imperial forces were able to escape without a battle.<ref>Hackett, ''Francis the First'', 245<U+2013>246.</ref>  Shortly afterwards, French troops under [[Guillaume Gouffier, seigneur de Bonnivet|Bonnivet]] and [[Claude, Duke of Guise|Claude of Lorraine]] seized the key city of [[Fuenterrabia]], at the mouth of the [[Bidasoa River]] on the Franco-Spanish border, following a protracted series of maneuvers, providing the French with an advantageous foothold in northern Spain that would remain in their hands for the next two years.

[[Image:Battles in Lombardy (1521-25).png|thumb|right|250px|Battles in [[Lombardy]] (1521<U+2013>25).  The engagements at Bicocca, the Sesia, and Pavia are labeled.]]

By November, the French situation had deteriorated considerably.  Charles, Henry VIII, and the Pope signed an alliance against Francis on [[November 28]].<ref>Konstam, ''Pavia 1525'', 88.</ref>  [[Odet de Foix, Vicomte de Lautrec]], the French governor of [[Milan]], was tasked with resisting the Imperial and Papal forces; he was outmatched by [[Prospero Colonna]], however, and by late November had been forced out of Milan and had retreated to a ring of towns around the [[Adda River]].<ref>Blockmans, ''Emperor Charles V'', 52; Hackett, ''Francis the First'', 247<U+2013>249.</ref>  There, Lautrec was reinforced by the arrival of fresh [[Swiss mercenaries]]; but, having no money available to pay them, he gave in to their demands to engage the Imperial forces immediately.<ref>Oman, ''Art of War'', 176<U+2013>178.</ref>  On [[April 27]], [[1522]], he attacked Colonna's combined Imperial and Papal army near Milan at the [[Battle of Bicocca]].  Lautrec had planned to use his superiority in [[artillery]] to his advantage, but the Swiss, impatient to engage the enemy, masked his guns and charged against the entrenched Spanish [[arquebus]]iers.  In the resulting melee, the Swiss were badly mauled by the Spanish under [[Fernando d'Avalos, Marquess of Pescara]], and by a force of [[landsknechts]] commanded by [[Georg Frundsberg]].  Their morale broken, the Swiss returned to their [[cantons of Switzerland|canton]]s; Lautrec, left with too few troops to continue the campaign, abandoned [[Lombardy]] entirely.<ref>Blockmans, ''Emperor Charles V'', 57; Hackett, ''Francis the First'', 249<U+2013>250; Taylor, ''Art of War in Italy'', 125<U+2013>126.</ref>  Colonna and d'Avalos, left unopposed, proceeded to [[Siege of Genoa (1522)|besiege Genoa]], capturing the city on [[May 30]].<ref>Blockmans, ''Emperor Charles V'', 57.</ref>

== France at bay (1522<U+2013>24) ==

Lautrec's defeat brought England openly into the conflict.  In late May 1522, the English ambassador presented Francis with an ultimatum enumerating accusations against France, notably that of supporting the [[John Stewart, 2nd Duke of Albany|Duke of Albany]] in [[Scotland]], all of which were denied by the king.<ref>Hackett, ''Francis the First'', 252<U+2013>253.</ref>  Henry VIII and Charles signed the Treaty of Windsor on [[16 June]] [[1522]].  The treaty outlined a joint English-Imperial attack against France, with each party providing at least 40,000 men.  Charles agreed to compensate England for the pensions that would be lost because of conflict with France and to pay the past debts that would be forfeit; to seal the alliance, he also agreed to marry Henry's only daughter, [[Mary I of England|Mary]].  In July, the English attacked [[Brittany]] and [[Picardy]] from [[Calais]]. Francis was unable to raise funds to sustain significant resistance, and the English army burned and looted the countryside.<ref>Hackett, ''Francis the First'', 253.</ref>

Francis tried a variety of methods to raise money, but concentrated on a lawsuit against [[Charles de Bourbon]].  Bourbon had received the majority of his holdings through his marriage to [[Suzanne de Bourbon]], who had died shortly before the start of the war. [[Louise of Savoy]], Suzanne's sister and the king's mother, insisted that the territories in question should pass to her because of her closer kinship to the deceased.  Francis was confident that seizing the disputed lands would improve his own financial position sufficiently to continue the war and began to confiscate portions of them in Loise's name. Bourbon, angered by this treatment and increasingly isolated at court, began to make overtures to Charles V to betray the French king.<ref>Hackett, ''Francis the First'', 255<U+2013>257; Konstam, ''Pavia 1525'', 25<U+2013>26.</ref>

By 1523, the French situation had entirely collapsed.  The death of [[Doge of Venice|Doge]] [[Antonio Grimani]] brought [[Andrea Gritti]], a veteran of the [[War of the League of Cambrai]], to power in Venice. He quickly began negotiations with the Emperor and on [[July 29]] concluded the Treaty of Worms, which removed the Republic from the war.<ref>Guicciardini, ''History of Italy'', 335; Norwich, ''History of Venice'', 439.</ref>  Bourbon continued his scheming with Charles, offering to begin a rebellion against Francis in exchange for money and German troops. When Francis, who was aware of the plot, summoned him to [[Lyon]] in October, he feigned illness and fled to [[Besan<U+00E7>on]], in Imperial territory.<ref>Hackett, ''Francis the First'', 261<U+2013>269.</ref>  Enraged, Francis ordered the execution of as many of Bourbon's associates as he could capture, but the Duke himself, having rejected a final offer of reconciliation, openly entered the Emperor's service.

Charles then invaded southern France over the [[Pyrenees]]. Lautrec successfully defended [[Bayonne]] against the Spanish, but Charles was able to recapture [[Fuenterrabia]] in February 1524.<ref>Blockmans, ''Emperor Charles V'', 45.</ref>  On [[18 September]] [[1523]], meanwhile, a massive English army under the [[Charles Brandon, 1st Duke of Suffolk|Duke of Suffolk]] advanced into French territory from Calais in conjunction with a Flemish-Imperial force.  The French, stretched thin by the Imperial attack, were unable to resist, and Suffolk soon advanced past the [[Somme]], devastating the countryside in his wake and stopping only fifty miles from [[Paris]].<ref>Hackett, ''Francis the First'', 269<U+2013>270.</ref>  When Charles failed to support the English offensive, however, Suffolk<U+2014>unwilling to risk an attack on the French capital<U+2014>turned away from Paris on [[30 October]], returning to Calais by mid-December.<ref>Gunn, "Suffolk's March", 631<U+2013>633.</ref>

[[Image:Guillaume Gouffier, Seigneur de Bonnivet.jpg|right|thumb|200px|[[Guillaume Gouffier, Seigneur de Bonnivet]], painted by [[Jean Clouet]] (c. 1516).  Bonnivet commanded a number of French armies during the war.]]

Francis now turned his attention to Lombardy.  In October 1523, a French army of 18,000 under Bonnivet advanced through the [[Piedmont]] to [[Novara]], where it was joined by a similarly-sized force of Swiss mercenaries. Prospero Colonna, who had only 9,000 men to oppose the French advance, retreated to Milan.<ref>Konstam, ''Pavia 1525'', 27.</ref>  Bonnivet, however, over-estimated the size of the Imperial army and moved into winter quarters rather than attacking the city; and the Imperial commanders were able to summon 15,000 landsknechts and a large force under Bourbon's command by December 28, when [[Charles de Lannoy]] replaced the dying Colonna.<ref>Konstam, ''Pavia 1525'', 27<U+2013>28.</ref>  Many of the Swiss now abandoned the French army, and Bonnivet began his withdrawal.  The French defeat at the [[Battle of the Sesia]], where Bayard was killed while commanding the French rearguard, again demonstrated the power of massed [[arquebus]]iers against more traditional troops; the French army then retreated over the Alps in disarray.<ref>Hackett, ''Francis the First'', 277<U+2013>278; Konstam, ''Pavia 1525'', 28; Taylor, ''Art of War in Italy'', 53<U+2013>54.</ref>  

D'Avalos and Bourbon crossed the Alps with nearly 11,000 men and invaded [[Provence]] in early July.<ref>Konstam, ''Pavia 1525'', 28.</ref>  Sweeping through most of the smaller towns unopposed, Bourbon entered the provincial capital of [[Aix-en-Provence]] on [[August 9]], taking the title of Count of Provence and pledging his allegiance to Henry VIII in return for the latter's support against Francis.<ref>Konstam, ''Pavia 1525'', 28<U+2013>29.</ref>  By mid-August, Bourbon and d'Avalos had [[Siege of Marseille (1524)|besieged Marseille]], the only stronghold in Provence that remained in French hands.  Their assaults on the city failed, however, and when the French army commanded by Francis himself arrived at [[Avignon]] at the end of September, they were forced to retreat back to Italy.<ref>Blockmans, ''Emperor Charles V'', 57; Guicciardini, ''History of Italy'', 343<U+2013>344; Hackett, ''Francis the First'', 277<U+2013>278; Konstam, ''Pavia 1525'', 29.</ref>

{{details|Italian campaign of 1524-1525}}

In mid-October, Francis himself crossed the Alps and advanced on Milan at the head of an army numbering more than 40,000.  Bourbon and d'Avalos, their troops not yet recovered from the campaign in Provence, were in no position to offer serious resistance.<ref>Hackett, ''Francis the First'', 281; Konstam, ''Pavia 1525'', 89.</ref>  The French army moved in several columns, brushing aside Imperial attempts to hold its advance, but failed to bring the main body of Imperial troops to battle.  Nevertheless, [[Charles de Lannoy]], who had concentrated some 16,000 men to resist the 33,000 French troops closing on Milan, decided that the city could not be defended and withdrew to [[Lodi]] on [[October 26]].<ref>Konstam, ''Pavia 1525'', 30<U+2014>33.</ref>  Having entered Milan and installed [[Louis II de la Tr<U+00E9>moille]] as the governor, Francis (at the urging of Bonnivet and against the advice of his other senior commanders, who favored a more vigorous pursuit of the retreating Lannoy) advanced on [[Pavia]], where [[Antonio de Leyva]] remained with a sizable Imperial garrison.<ref>Konstam, ''Pavia 1525'', 34.</ref>  

[[Image:Pavia campaign (1524-25).png|250px|left|thumb|The French advance into Lombardy and the Pavia campaign of 1524<U+2013>25.  French movements are indicated in blue and Imperial movements in red.]]

The main mass of French troops arrived at Pavia in the last days of October.  By [[November 2]], Montmorency had crossed the [[Ticino River]] and invested the city from the south, completing its encirclement.  Inside were about 9,000 men, mainly mercenaries whom Antonio de Leyva was able to pay only by melting the church plate.<ref>Konstam, ''Pavia 1525'', 34<U+2013>35.</ref>  A period of skirmishing and artillery bombardments followed, and several breaches had been made in the walls by mid-November.  On [[November 21]], Francis attempted an assault on the city through two of the breaches, but was beaten back with heavy casualties; hampered by rainy weather and a lack of gunpowder, the French decided to wait for the defenders to starve.<ref>Konstam, ''Pavia 1525'', 36<U+2013>39.</ref>

In early December, a Spanish force commanded by [[Hugo de Moncada]] landed near [[Genoa]], intending to interfere in a conflict between pro-Valois and pro-Habsburg factions in the city.  Francis dispatched a larger force under the [[Marquis of Saluzzo]] to intercept them.  Confronted by the more numerous French and left without naval support by the arrival of a pro-Valois fleet commanded by [[Andrea Doria]], the Spanish troops surrendered.<ref>Konstam, ''Pavia 1525'', 40<U+2013>41.</ref>  Francis then signed a secret agreement with Pope [[Clement VII]], who pledged not to assist Charles in exchange for Francis's assistance with the conquest of Naples.  Against the advice of his senior commanders, Francis detached a portion of his forces under the [[John Stewart, Duke of Albany|Duke of Albany]] and sent them south to aid the Pope.<ref>Blockmans, ''Emperor Charles V'', 57; Konstam, ''Pavia 1525'', 42<U+2013>43.</ref>  Lannoy attempted to intercept the expedition near [[Fiorenzuola]], but suffered heavy casualties and was forced to return to Lodi by the intervention of the infamous [[Black Bands]] of [[Giovanni dalle Bande Nere|Giovanni de' Medici]], which had just entered French service.  Medici then returned to Pavia with a supply train of gunpowder and shot gathered by the [[Duke of Ferrara]]; but the French position was simultaneously weakened by the departure of nearly 5,000 [[Grisons]] [[Swiss mercenaries]], who returned to their [[Canton (subnational entity)|canton]]s in order to defend them against marauding [[landsknechts]].<ref>Konstam, ''Pavia 1525'', 43<U+2013>45.</ref>

[[Image:Battle of Pavia.jpg|300px|right|thumb|Part of ''The Pavia Tapestry'' by [[Barnaert van Orley]] (c. 1531).]]

In January 1525, Lannoy was reinforced by the arrival of [[Georg Frundsberg]] with 15,000 fresh landsknechts and renewed the offensive.  D'Avalos captured the French outpost at [[San Angelo]], cutting the lines of communication between Pavia and Milan, while a separate column of landsknechts advanced on [[Belgiojoso]] and, despite being briefly pushed back by a raid led by Medici and Bonnivet, occupied the town.<ref>Blockmans, ''Emperor Charles V'', 59; Konstam, ''Pavia 1525'', 46<U+2013>50.</ref>  By [[February 2]], Lannoy was only a few miles from Pavia.  Francis had encamped the majority of his forces in the great walled park of [[Mirabello]] outside the city walls, placing them between Leyva's garrison and the approaching relief army.<ref>Hackett, ''Francis the First'', 286; Konstam, ''Pavia 1525'', 50.</ref>  Skirmishing and sallies by the garrison continued through the month of February.  Medici was seriously wounded and withdrew to [[Piacenza]] to recuperate, forcing Francis to recall much of the Milan garrison to offset the departure of the Black Band; but the fighting had little overall effect.  On [[February 21]], the Imperial commanders, running low on supplies and mistakenly believing that the French forces were more numerous than their own, decided to launch an attack on Mirabello Castle in order to save face and demoralize the French sufficiently to ensure a safe withdrawal.<ref>Konstam, ''Pavia 1525'', 52<U+2013>53.</ref>

In the early morning of [[February 24]], [[1525]], Imperial engineers opened breaches in the walls of Mirabello, allowing Lannoy's forces to enter the park. At the same time, Leyva sortied from Pavia with what remained of the garrison.  In the ensuing four-hour [[Battle of Pavia|battle]], the French heavy cavalry, which had proven so effective against the Swiss at [[Battle of Marignano|Marignano]] ten years prior, masked its own artillery by a rapid advance and was surrounded and cut apart by landsknechts and d'Avalos's massed Spanish arquebusiers.  Meanwhile, a series of protracted infantry engagements resulted in the rout of the Swiss and French infantry.  The French suffered massive casualties, losing the majority of their army. Bonnivet, [[Jacques de la Palice]], [[Louis II de La Tr<U+00E9>moille|La Tr<U+00E9>moille]], and [[Richard de la Pole]] were killed, while [[Anne de Montmorency]], [[Robert de la Marck]], and Francis himself were taken prisoner along with a host of lesser nobles.<ref>Hackett, ''Francis the First'', 288<U+2013>293; Konstam, ''Pavia 1525'', 56<U+2013>74; Taylor, ''Art of War in Italy'', 126<U+2013>127.</ref>  The night following the battle, Francis gave Lannoy a letter to be delivered to his mother in Paris, in which he related what had befallen him: "To inform you of how the rest of my ill-fortune is proceeding, all is lost to me save honour and life, which is safe."<ref>Konstam, ''Pavia 1525'', 76.  Hackett gives a similar translation and notes that contemporary sources shortened this to "all lost save honour" (''Francis the First'', 298).</ref>  Soon afterwards, he finally learned that the Duke of Albany had lost the larger part of his army to attrition and desertion, and had returned to France without ever having reached Naples.<ref>Guicciardini, ''History of Italy'', 348.</ref>  The broken remnants of the French forces, aside from a small garrison left to hold the [[Castel Sforzesco]] in Milan, retreated across the Alps under the nominal command of [[Charles IV of Alen<U+00E7>on]], reaching [[Lyon]] by March.<ref>Konstam, ''Pavia 1525'', 76.</ref>

After Pavia, the fate of the French king, and of France herself, became the subject of furious diplomatic maneuvering.  Charles V, lacking funds to pay for the war, decided to forgo the marriage into the [[House of Tudor]] which he had promised Henry VIII and sought instead to marry [[Isabella of Portugal, Empress|Isabella of Portugal]], who would bring with her a more substantial dowry. Bourbon, meanwhile, plotted with Henry to invade and partition France, and at the same time encouraged d'Avalos to seize Naples and declare himself King of Italy.<ref>Guicciardini, ''History of Italy'', 358<U+2013>359; Hackett, ''Francis the First'', 308<U+2013>311.  D'Avalos, his loyalty to Spain outweighing his own ambition, refused and reported the offers to Charles.</ref>  [[Louise of Savoy]], who had remained as [[regent]] in France during her son's absence, attempted to gather troops and funds to defend against an expected invasion of Artois by English troops.<ref>Guicciardini, ''History of Italy'', 357<U+2013>358.</ref>  Francis, convinced that he would regain his freedom if he could obtain a personal audience with Charles, pressed d'Avalos and Lannoy, who had intended to transport the king to the [[Castelnuovo]] in Naples, to send him to Spain instead. Concerned by Bourbon's scheming, they agreed and Francis arrived in [[Barcelona]] on [[June 12]].<ref>Guicciardini, ''History of Italy'', 358; Hackett, ''Francis the First'', 311.  Guicciardini notes that he did not "know whether [Francis believed this] because he measured men by his own nature; or because men easily delude themselves when their own desires are involved."</ref>

Francis was initially held in a villa near [[Valencia (city in Spain)|Valencia]], but Charles, urged to negotiate a settlement by Montmorency and Lannoy, who suggested that the Italians would soon prove unfaithful to their Imperial alliance, ordered the king brought to [[Madrid]] and imprisoned in the citadel there.  He adamantly refused, however, to receive Francis personally until the latter had accepted an agreement.<ref>Guicciardini, ''History of Italy'', 359.</ref>  Charles demanded not only the surrender of Lombardy, but also of Burgundy and Provence, forcing Francis to argue that French law prevented him from surrendering any lands possessed by the crown without the approval of [[Parlement]], which would not be forthcoming.<ref>Guicciardini, ''History of Italy'', 357.  The Imperial demands were first delivered to Francis by B<U+00FC>ren, the Emperor's chamberlain, when he was still imprisoned in the fortress of [[Pizzichitone]] after the Battle of Pavia; Charles had originally intended that Bourbon would be given an independent Provence as a reward for his services.</ref>

In September, Francis fell gravely ill, and his sister, [[Marguerite de Navarre]], rode from Paris to join him in Spain.<ref>Guicciardini, ''History of Italy'', 359; Hackett, ''Francis the First'', 313<U+2013>315.</ref>  The Imperial doctors examining the king believed that his illness was caused by his sorrow at not being received by the Emperor, and urged Charles to visit him.  Charles, against the advice of his Grand Chancellor, [[Mercurino Gattinara]], who argued that seeing Francis on his deathbed was an action motivated by mercenary concerns rather than by compassion, and was thus unworthy of the Emperor, consented; and Francis soon made a complete recovery.<ref>Guicciardini, ''History of Italy'', 360.</ref>  An attempt to escape, however, proved fruitless, and succeeded only in getting Marguerite sent back to France.<ref>Hackett, ''Francis the First'', 319.</ref>

By the beginning of 1526, Charles was faced with demands from Venice and the Pope to restore [[Francesco II Sforza]] to the throne of the [[Duchy of Milan]], and had become anxious to achieve a settlement with the French before another war began.  Francis, having argued to retain Burgundy without result, was prepared to surrender it to achieve his own release.<ref>Guicciardini, ''History of Italy'', 363.</ref>  On [[January 14]], [[1526]], Charles and Francis agreed to the Treaty of Madrid, by which the French king renounced all his claims in Italy, [[Flanders]], and [[Artois]], surrendered [[Burgundy]] to Charles, agreed to send two of his sons to be hostages at the Spanish court, and promised to marry Charles' sister [[Eleanor of Spain|Eleanor]] and to restore to Bourbon the territories that had been seized from him.<ref>Blockmans, ''Emperor Charles V'', 60, 68; Guicciardini, ''History of Italy'', 363<U+2013>364; Oman, ''Art of War'', 211.</ref>  Francis was released on [[March 6]] and, escorted by Lannoy, journeyed north to Fuenterrabia.  On [[March 18]], he crossed the Bidasoa north into France, while at the same time the [[Dauphin]] and his brother, who had been brought to Bayonne by Louise and Lautrec, crossed into Spain and into captivity.<ref>Guicciardini, ''History of Italy'', 366.</ref>  By this time, Francis had attained peace with England by the Treaty of Hampton Court; drafted by [[Thomas Wolsey]] and the French ambassador at the [[Hampton Court Palace]], the treaty was signed in 1526, and was ratified by a French delegation in April 1527 at [[Greenwich]].

Francis, however, had no intentions of complying with the remaining provisions of the Treaty of Madrid.  On [[March 22]], with the Pope's blessing, he proclaimed that he would not be bound by the Treaty of Madrid because it had been signed under duress.  [[Clement VII]], who had meanwhile become convinced that the Emperor's growing power was a threat to his own position in Italy, sent envoys to Francis and Henry VIII suggesting an alliance against Charles.<ref>Guicciardini, ''History of Italy'', 365<U+2013>366.  Guicciardini records that Clement feared that "the Emperor's greatness would inevitably mean his servitude."</ref>  Henry, having received nothing from the Treaty of Madrid, was receptive to the offers.  In May, Francis and the Pope launched the [[War of the League of Cognac]] in an attempt to reclaim the territory the French had lost; Henry, rebuffed in his attempt to have the alliance signed in England, would not join until 1527.<ref>Guicciardini, ''History of Italy'', 369, 392.</ref>  The war would prove unsuccessful; but Francis and his successor, [[Henry II of France|Henry II]], would continue to assert their claims to Milan through the remainder of the Italian Wars, only relinquishing them after the [[Peace of Cateau-Cambr<U+00E9>sis]] in 1559.
