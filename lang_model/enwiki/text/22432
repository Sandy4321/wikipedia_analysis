'''''Thomasomys ucucha''''', also known as the '''Ucucha Thomasomys''',<ref>Musser and Carleton, 2005, p. 1184</ref> is a [[rodent]] in the genus ''[[Thomasomys]]'' of the family [[Cricetidae]]. Found only in the ''[[Cordillera Oriental (Ecuador)|Cordillera Oriental]]'' (Eastern mountain range) of Ecuador, it lives in forests and grasslands at 3,380 to 3,720&nbsp;m (11,090 to 12,200&nbsp;ft) above sea level. It may occur with seven other species of ''Thomasomys''. First collected in 1903, ''Thomasomys ucucha'' was formally described in 2003 and most closely resembles ''[[Thomasomys hylophilus|T.&nbsp;hylophilus]]'', which occurs further to the north. [[Habitat destruction]] may threaten ''T.&nbsp;ucucha'', so that it is listed as "[[Vulnerable species|Vulnerable]]" on the [[IUCN Red List]].

Medium-sized, dark-furred, and long-tailed, ''Thomasomys ucucha'' can be distinguished from all other species of ''Thomasomys'' by its large, broad, [[wikt:procumbent|procumbent]] upper [[incisor]]s. Head and body length is 94 to 119&nbsp;mm (3.7 to 4.7&nbsp;in) and body mass is 24 to 46&nbsp;g (0.8 to 1.6&nbsp;oz). The tail is scarcely furred. The front part of the skull is flat, short, and broad. The [[incisive foramina]], openings at the front of the [[palate]], are short, and the palate itself is broad and smooth. The root of the lower incisor is contained in a prominent [[capsular process]].

==Taxonomy==
The first three specimens of ''Thomasomys ucucha'' were collected in 1903 at [[Tabl<U+00F3>n]] in [[Pichincha Province]], Ecuador, by L. S<U+00F6>derstr<U+00F6>m. It was not found again until 1978 and 1980, when Robert S. Voss of the [[American Museum of Natural History]] collected a total of forty-three specimens at nearby [[Papallacta]], [[Napo Province]].<ref name=V10/> Papallacta is in a remote area that is difficult to access, and the mammal fauna of the region remains poorly known.<ref name=V2/> In 2003, he formally described the animal as a new species, ''Thomasomys ucucha'',<ref name=V10>Voss, 2003, p.&nbsp;10</ref> in a publication in ''[[American Museum Novitates]]'' in which he also reviewed the mammal fauna of Papallacta.<ref name=V2>Voss, 2003, p.&nbsp;2</ref> The [[name of a biological genus|generic name]], ''[[Thomasomys]]'', honors English zoologist [[Oldfield Thomas]], who named about 2,900 [[taxon|taxa]] of mammals,<ref>Beolen et al., 2009, pp. 410<U+2013>411</ref>  and the [[specific name]], ''ucucha'', is the local [[Quechua]] word for "mouse".<ref name=V10/> ''T.&nbsp;ucucha'' most closely resembles ''[[Thomasomys hylophilus|T. hylophilus]]'', which is found further north in Colombia and Venezuela.<ref name=V12>Voss, 2003, p.&nbsp;12</ref> Both are members of ''Thomasomys'', a diverse genus that occurs in the northern Andes, from Bolivia to Venezuela.<ref name=V8>Voss, 2003, p.&nbsp;8</ref> Together with ''[[Rhipidomys]]'' and a few other, smaller genera, ''Thomasomys'' forms the tribe [[Thomasomyini]], which includes over fifty species found in South America and Panama. Thomasomyini in turn is part of the subfamily [[Sigmodontinae]] of the family [[Cricetidae]], along with hundreds of other species of mainly small rodents.<ref>Musser and Carleton, 2005</ref>

==Description==
''Thomasomys ucucha'' is a medium-sized ''Thomasomys'' with a relatively long tail. The dense, fine, and soft fur is dark brown on the upperparts, changing gradually into the grey underparts. The [[mystacial vibrissae]] (whiskers above the mouth) are long and extend beyond the ears when laid back against the head. Sparse short, dark hairs are present on the ears.<ref name=V10/> The digits and [[metapodial]]s (bones of the centers of the hand and feet) of the hands and feet are covered with dark hairs, but the [[ungual tufts]] at the bases of the claws consist of longer, gray hairs. The fifth digit of the foot is long, with the tip of its claw almost reaching the base of the claw of the fourth digit. The tail is dark and hardly furred, except for a pencil of long hairs at the end; some animals have a white tail tip. Females have six [[mammae]].<ref name=V11>Voss, 2003, p.&nbsp;11</ref> In thirty-six specimens, head and body length is 94 to 119&nbsp;mm (3.7 to 4.7&nbsp;in), averaging 110&nbsp;mm (4.3&nbsp;in); tail length is 122 to 151&nbsp;mm (4.8 to 5.9&nbsp;in), averaging 140&nbsp;mm (5.5&nbsp;in); hindfoot length is 26 to 30&nbsp;mm (1 to 1.2&nbsp;in), averaging 28&nbsp;mm (1.1&nbsp;in); ear length is 17 to 20&nbsp;mm (0.7 to 0.8&nbsp;in), averaging 18&nbsp;mm (0.7&nbsp;in); and weight is 24 to 46&nbsp;g (0.8 to 1.6&nbsp;oz), averaging 36&nbsp;g (1.3&nbsp;oz).<ref>Voss, 2003, table&nbsp;1</ref>

The front (rostral) part of the [[skull]] is short&mdash;shorter and broader than in ''T.&nbsp;hylophilus''<ref name=V13>Voss, 2003, p.&nbsp;13</ref>&mdash;and flat and the notches in the [[zygomatic plate]]s at the sides are poorly developed.<ref name=V11/> The plates themselves are broad.<ref>Voss, 2003, table&nbsp;2</ref> The [[zygomatic arch]]es (cheekbones) spread broadly and are rounded in shape.<ref name=V13/> The narrow [[interorbital region]] (between the eyes) is hourglass-shaped. The [[braincase]] is robust.<ref name=V11/>

The [[incisive foramen|incisive foramina]], which perforate the [[palate]] between the [[incisor]]s and the [[molar (tooth)|molars]], are short and do not reach near the first molars;<ref name=V11/> they are longer in ''T.&nbsp;hylophilus''.<ref name=V13/> They are widest where the [[premaxilla]]ry and [[maxilla]]ry bones meet. The palate itself is also short, not extending beyond the third molars, and is broad and lacks ridges or grooves. There are simple [[posterolateral palatal pits]] at the back of the palate, near the third molars. The [[mesopterygoid fossa]], an opening located behind the end of the palate, is broad and its roof is either fully ossified or perforated by small [[sphenopalatine vacuities]] where the [[sphenoid bone|presphenoid]] and [[basisphenoid]] bones meet. An [[alisphenoid strut]] separates two [[foramen|foramina]] (openings) at the base of the skull, the [[buccinator-masticatory foramen]] and the [[foramen ovale accessorius]]. The pattern of grooves and foramina on the head indicates that the circulation of the arteries in the head of ''T.&nbsp;ucucha'' follows the primitive pattern. The [[tegmen tympani]], the roof of the [[tympanic cavity]], overlaps the suspensory [[process (anatomy)|process]] of the [[squamosal bone]]. At the back of the [[mandible]] (lower jaw), there is a [[capsular process]] to receive the root of the lower [[incisor]],<ref name=V11/> which is absent in ''T.&nbsp;hylophilus''.<ref name=V13/>

The large upper incisors are [[orthodont]], with their cutting edge at about a right angle to the upper molars, and heavily pigmented with orange. Those of ''T.&nbsp;hylophilus'' are narrower, less procumbent, and less pigmented.<ref name=V13/> The orthodont upper incisors suffice to distinguish ''T.&nbsp;ucucha'' from all other members of the genus but ''[[Thomasomys australis|T.&nbsp;australis]]'' and ''[[Thomasomys daphne|T.&nbsp;daphne]]'', which have much shorter and narrower incisors.<ref name=V14/> The left and right molar rows are parallel. The molars are more [[hypsodont]] (high-crowned) than in other ''Thomasomys''. The [[anterocone]], the cusp at the front of the first upper molar, is divided into distinct cuspules at the lingual (inner) and labial (outer) sides by an [[anteromedian flexus]].<ref name=V11/> The accessory ridges on the upper molars, the [[anteroloph]]s and [[mesoloph]]s, are less well-developed than in ''T.&nbsp;hylophilus''. The third upper molar is reduced relative to the second, much more so than in ''T.&nbsp;hylophilus''.<ref name=V13/> The lower molars are generally similar to the uppers, but the [[anteroconid]] (the equivalent of the anterocone on the first lower molar) is often undivided and the third molar is unreduced.<ref name=V11/>

The [[glans penis]] is rounded, short, and small and is superficially divided into left and right halves by a trough at the top and a ridge at the bottom. Most of the glans is covered with spines, except for an area near the tip.<ref name=V11/>

==Distribution and ecology==
''Thomasomys ucucha'' occurs only in the ''[[Cordillera Oriental (Ecuador)|Cordillera Oriental]]'' of Ecuador in the provinces of Pichincha and Napo.<ref name=V10/> At Papallacta, ''Thomasomys ucucha'' was collected in a variety of habitats at 3380 to 3720&nbsp;m (11090 to 12200&nbsp;ft) altitude, including ''[[p<U+00E1>ramo]]'' (high-mountain grassland with shrubs and forest patches) and [[subalpine rainforest]].<ref name=V14>Voss, 2003, p.&nbsp;14</ref> Most were taken in runways (paths through vegetation made by animals) and a few alongside small streams or on a low tree.<ref>Voss, 2003, pp.&nbsp;14&ndash;15</ref> Other [[muroid]] rodents found at the same places as ''T.&nbsp;ucucha'' include two [[akodontini|akodontines]] (grass mice), ''[[Akodon latebricola]]'' and ''[[Akodon mollis]]''; two [[Ichthyomyini|ichthyomyines]] (water rats), ''[[Anotomys leander]]'' and ''[[Neusticomys monticolus]]''; two [[Oryzomyini|oryzomyines]] (rice rats), ''[[Microryzomys altissimus]]'' and ''[[Microryzomys minutus|M. minutus]]''; the thomasomyine ''[[Chilomys instans]]''; and five other species of ''Thomasomys'', ''[[Thomasomys aureus|T. aureus]]'', ''[[Thomasomys baeops|T. baeops]]'', ''[[Thomasomys cinnameus|T. cinnameus]]'', ''[[Thomasomys erro|T. erro]]'', and ''[[Thomasomys paramorum|T. paramorum]]''.<ref name=V15>Voss, 2003, p.&nbsp;15</ref> Other species have been recorded nearby, and Voss wrote that ''T.&nbsp;ucucha'' may occur [[sympatric]]ally with seven other species of ''Thomasomys''.<ref name=V8/> With ''Akodon latebricola'' and ''Thomasomys erro'', ''T.&nbsp;ucucha'' is one of three species that are known only from the northeastern Andes of Ecuador.<ref>Voss, 2003, p.&nbsp;37</ref>

==Conservation status==
''Thomasomys ucucha'' is locally common, but has a very limited known distribution.<ref name=T198/> Its conservation status has been assessed as "[[Vulnerable species|Vulnerable]]" by the [[IUCN]] because of its small distribution; it may be threatened by the destruction of its habitat for [[agriculture|agricultural]] purposes,<ref name=iucn/> but occurs near two [[protected area]]s.<ref name=T198>Tirira, 2007, p.&nbsp;198</ref>
