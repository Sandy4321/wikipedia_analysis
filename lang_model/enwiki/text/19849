'''Cameron Park Zoo''' is a zoo located in the city of [[Waco, Texas|Waco]], [[Texas]], [[United States|USA]] which was originally established in 1955 as the Central Texas Zoological Park.

The Cameron Park Zoo is accredited by the [[Association of Zoos and Aquariums]] (AZA) and is a member of the World Association of Zoos and Aquariums (WAZA).

== History ==
Initially established in 1955 as the Central Texas Zoological Park, by a group of wildlife enthusiasts who wanted to create an area for recreation and education opportunities.

In 1981, a master plan was established to expand the zoo, and in 1989 a countywide bond was issued to redevelop a 52 acre area of Cameron Park, into the Cameron Park Zoo. The project was completed, the old zoo was closed, and the new zoo was opened to the public July 18, 1993.

The Cameron Park Zoo features species from [[North America|North]] and [[South America]], [[Africa]], [[Asia]] and [[Europe]]. Including a large [[reptile]] house, an African [[lion]] display, and Lemur Island, a large open [[lemur]] habitat. In 2005, a large new area was opened called the [[Brazos River]] Country, featuring a 50,000 gallon saltwater [[reef]] aquarium, a large swampland habitat, and many other native Texas type habitats, featuring numerous species found within the state. The exhibit is so large, it nearly doubled the animal population, and overall size of the zoo.

== Cameron Park ==
