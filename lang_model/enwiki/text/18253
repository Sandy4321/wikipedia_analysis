== History ==
The [[mountain]] that is now called Roxy Ann Peak was known to the [[Takelma]] Indians for thousands of years as Al-wiya. The most probable usage for the peak was as a [[lookout]], as landmarks such as [[Mount Shasta]], approximately {{convert|100|mi|-1}} to the south, can be seen clearly.<ref name="summitpost">

The mountain was also a good place for hunting [[black-tailed deer]] and small [[bird]]s, animals which are still abundant in the area today.<ref name="mt1">

By 1853, almost the entire peak had been [[land claim|claimed]] by two couples, Stephan and Mary A Taylor, and John and Roxy Ann Bowen. They owned the land for nearly 70 years, and in time the mountain came to be known as Roxy Ann Peak.<ref name="brochure"/><ref name="mt2"/> Residents of Medford have taken pride in their mountain, first by declaring the town's [[independence day]] on its peak in 1884,<ref name="mt1"/> and later by protecting the area as a city park.

In 1929, the [[Lions Clubs International|Lions Club]] purchased a sizable portion of land on the peak, and in the following year donated {{convert|200|acre|km2|1}} to Medford. A year after that, the city bought another {{convert|1500|acre|km2|1}} under the Federal Lands for Parks Act.<ref name="brochure"/> The park was named after Constable George J.

Medford Police officers devoted much of their time to patrolling the mountain, which created even more of a strain due to the park's location and accessibility. In 2000, the city installed a gate in an effort to limit vehicle [[traffic]] after certain hours.<ref name="brochure"/><ref>

A controversial bill passed in 2003, House Bill 3375, required that new [[construction]] on slopes of 20% or greater with unstable soil undergo increased [[regulation]] and an extended approval process. The bill had the potential to limit new development in over a third of [[Jackson County, Oregon|Jackson County]], with almost all of Roxy Ann peak included. The potential cost of new [[foundation (engineering)|foundations]] doubled to almost $30,000, with the cost of [[retrofitting]] an existing structure approaching $100,000.<ref name="sliding"/>

Accessing Roxy Ann Peak is done via Roxy Ann Road, which climbs about halfway up the mountain. There are two park gates, a lower one near the residential area on the lower slopes,  and an upper one part-way to the summit.
