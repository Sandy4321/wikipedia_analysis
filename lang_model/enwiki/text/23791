'''Old Trafford''' is an [[all-seater stadium|all-seater]] [[association football|football]] [[stadium]] in the [[Trafford]] borough of [[Greater Manchester]], [[England]], and is the home of [[Premier League]] club [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]]. With space for 75,797&nbsp;spectators,<ref name="record_gate"/> Old Trafford has the second-largest capacity of any English football stadium after [[Wembley Stadium]], the third-largest of any stadium in the [[United Kingdom]], and the eleventh-largest in Europe. It is one of two stadia in the country to have been given a [[UEFA elite stadium|five-star rating]] by [[UEFA]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://pictures.footymad.net/upload/247/284217-1.pdf |title=Stadia List |accessdate=2 May 2008 |format=PDF |publisher=UEFA }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=UEFA announces 2011 and 2012 final venues |url=http://www.uefa.com/uefa/keytopics/kind=64/newsid=796145.html |work=UEFA.com |publisher=Union of European Football Associations |date=29 January 2009 |accessdate=29 January 2009 }}</ref> The stadium is approximately {{convert|0.5|mi|km|1}} from [[Old Trafford Cricket Ground]] and the adjacent [[Manchester Metrolink]] tram station. 

The ground, given the nickname ''the Theatre of Dreams'' by [[Bobby Charlton]], has been United's permanent residence since 1910, with the exception of an eight-year absence from 1941 to 1949, following the bombing of the stadium in the [[World War II|Second World War]]. During this period, the club shared [[Maine Road]] with local rivals, [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]]. The ground underwent several expansions in the 1990s and 2000s, most notably the addition of extra tiers to the North, West and East stands which served to return the ground almost to its original capacity of 80,000. Future expansion is likely to involve the addition of a second tier to the South Stand, which would raise the capacity to over 90,000.<ref name="manutdzone">{{cite web |url=http://www.manutdzone.com/oldtrafford/oldtrafford.htm |title=Old Trafford 1909-2006 |accessdate=7 February 2008 |publisher=manutdzone.com }}</ref> The stadium's current record attendance was recorded in 1939, when 76,962 spectators watched the [[FA Cup]] semi-final between [[Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C.|Wolverhampton Wanderers]] and [[Grimsby Town F.C.|Grimsby Town]].<ref name="sky_sports">{{cite book |last=Rollin |first=Glenda |coauthors=and Rollin, Jack |title=Sky Sports Football Yearbook 2008-2009 |series=Sky Sports Football Yearbooks |year=2008 |publisher=Headline Publishing Group |location=London |isbn=978-0-7553-1820-9 |pages=254<U+2013>255 |chapter=The Clubs }}</ref>

The ground has frequently hosted FA Cup semi-final matches as a neutral venue and several [[English national football team|England]] international fixtures while the new Wembley Stadium was under construction. It also hosted matches at the [[1966 FIFA World Cup]] and [[UEFA Euro 1996|Euro 96]] and the [[2003 UEFA Champions League Final]]. Aside from football-related uses, Old Trafford has hosted [[Super League]]'s Grand Final since the [[rugby league]]'s adoption of playoffs in 1998 and the final of the [[2000 Rugby League World Cup]].

==History==
===Construction and early years===
[[File:Sir Matt Busby Statue.jpg|thumb|upright|The statue of [[Sir Matt Busby]], overlooking the East Stand forecourt]]
Before 1902, Manchester United were known as Newton Heath, during which time they first played their football matches at [[North Road (stadium)|North Road]] and then [[Bank Street (stadium)|Bank Street]] in [[Clayton, Greater Manchester|Clayton]]. However, both grounds were blighted by wretched conditions, the pitches ranging from gravel to marsh, while Bank Street suffered from clouds of fumes from its neighbouring factories.<ref>{{cite book |last=Murphy |first=Alex |title=The Official Illustrated History of Manchester United |publisher=Orion Books |year=2006 |location=London |page=14 |isbn=0-75287-603-1 }}</ref> Therefore, following the club's rescue from near-bankruptcy and renaming, the new chairman [[John Henry Davies]] decided in 1909 that the Bank Street ground was not fit for a team that had recently won the [[Football League First Division|First Division]] and [[FA Cup]], so he donated funds for the construction of a new stadium.<ref>Murphy, p. 27</ref> Not one to spend money frivolously, Davies scouted around Manchester for an appropriate site, before settling on a patch of land adjacent to the [[Bridgewater Canal]], just off the north end of the Warwick Road in [[Old Trafford, Greater Manchester|Old Trafford]].<ref name="mccartney_9">{{cite book |last=McCartney |first=Iain |title=Old Trafford - Theatre of Dreams |year=1996 |publisher=Yore Publications |location=Harefield |isbn=1-874427-96-8 |page=9 }}</ref>

Designed by Scottish architect [[Archibald Leitch]], who designed several other stadia, the ground was originally designed with a capacity of 100,000 spectators and featured seating in the south stand under cover, while the remaining three stands were left as terraces and uncovered.<ref>{{cite book |last=Inglis |first=Simon |title=Football Grounds of Britain |origyear=1985 |edition=3rd edition |year=1996 |publisher=CollinsWillow |location=London |isbn=0-00-218426-5 |pages=234<U+2013>235 }}</ref> Including the purchase of the land, the construction of the stadium was originally to have cost <U+00A3>60,000 all told. However, as costs began to rise, to reach the intended capacity would have cost an extra <U+00A3>30,000 over the original estimate and, at the suggestion of club secretary [[John Bentley (football manager)|J. J. Bentley]], the capacity was reduced to approximately 80,000.<ref>{{cite book |last=White |first=John |title=The Official Manchester United Almanac |edition=1st edition |year=2008 |publisher=Orion Books |location=London |isbn=978-0-7528-9192-7 |page=50 |chapter=February }}</ref><ref>McCartney, p. 13</ref> Nevertheless, at a time when transfer fees were still around the <U+00A3>1,000 mark, the cost of construction only served to reinforce the club's "Moneybags United" epithet, with which they had been tarred since Davies had taken over as chairman.<ref>Inglis, p. 234</ref>

In May 1908, Archibald Leitch wrote to the [[Cheshire Lines Committee]] (CLC) <U+2013> who had a rail depot adjacent to the proposed site for the football ground <U+2013> in an attempt to persuade them to subsidise construction of the grandstand alongside the railway line. The subsidy would have come to the sum of <U+00A3>10,000, to be paid back at the rate of <U+00A3>2,000 ''per annum'' for five years or half of the gate receipts for the grandstand each year until the loan was repaid. However, despite guarantees for the loan coming from the club itself and two local breweries, both chaired by club chairman John Henry Davies, the Cheshire Lines Committee turned the proposal down.<ref>McCartney, p. 10</ref> The CLC had planned to build a new station adjacent to the new stadium, with the promise of an anticipated <U+00A3>2,750 ''per annum'' in fares offsetting the <U+00A3>9,800 cost of building the station. The station <U+2013> [[Trafford Park railway station|Trafford Park]] <U+2013> was eventually built, but further down the line than originally planned.<ref name="mccartney_9"/> The CLC later constructed a modest station with one timber-built platform immediately adjacent to the stadium and this opened on 21 August 1935. It was initially named United Football Ground,<ref>{{cite book |last=Butt |first=R.V.J. |title=The Directory of Railway Stations |year=1995 |publisher=Patrick Stephens |isbn=1-85260-508-1 |page=247 }}</ref> but was renamed Old Trafford Football Ground in early 1936. It was served on match days only by a shuttle service of steam trains from [[Manchester Central railway station]].<ref>Butt, p. 178</ref> It was finally renamed [[Manchester United FC Halt]] on an unknown date.{{fact|date=July 2009}}

Construction was carried out by Messrs Brameld and Smith of Manchester<ref name="encyclopedia">{{cite book |last1=Barnes |first1=Justyn |last2=Bostock |first2=Adam |last3=Butler |first3=Cliff |last4=Ferguson |first4=Jim |last5=Meek |first5=David |last6=Mitten |first6=Andy |last7=Pilger |first7=Sam |last8=Taylor |first8=Frank OBE |last9=Tyrrell |first9=Tom |title=The Official Manchester United Illustrated Encyclopedia |publisher=Manchester United Books |year=2001 |location=London |isbn=0-233-99964-7 |pages=44<U+2013>47, 52 |lastauthoramp=& }}</ref> and development was completed in late 1909. The stadium hosted its inaugural game on 19 February 1910, with United playing host to [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]]. However, the home side were unable to provide their fans with a win to mark the occasion, as Liverpool won 4&ndash;3. A journalist at the game reported the stadium as "the most handsomest [sic], the most spacious and the most remarkable arena I have ever seen. As a football ground it is unrivalled in the world, it is an honour to Manchester and the home of a team who can do wonders when they are so disposed".<ref>White (2008), p. 50</ref>

Before the construction of [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley Stadium]] in 1923, the [[FA Cup Final]] was hosted by a number of different grounds around England including Old Trafford.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thefa.com/TheFACup/TheFACup/History/Postings/2003/11/FACupStatistics.htm |title=Cup Final Statistics |accessdate=4 September 2008 |date=17 May 2008 |work=TheFA.com |publisher=The Football Association }}</ref> The first of these was the [[1911 FA Cup Final]] replay between [[Bradford City A.F.C.|Bradford City]] and [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]], after the original tie at [[Crystal Palace National Sports Centre|Crystal Palace]] finished as a no-score draw after [[extra time]].

===Wartime bombing===
In 1936, as part of a <U+00A3>35,000 refurbishment, an 80-yard-long roof was added to the United Road stand (now the North Stand) for the first time,<ref name="inglis_235">Inglis, p. 235</ref> while roofs were added to the south corners in 1938.<ref name="rivalry">{{cite book |last=Brandon |first=Derek |title=A<U+2013>Z of Manchester Football: 100 Years of Rivalry |publisher=Boondoggle |location=London |year=1978 |pages=179<U+2013>180 }}</ref> Upon the outbreak of the [[World War II|Second World War]], Old Trafford was requisitioned by the military to be used as a depot.<ref name="mccartney_20">McCartney, p. 20</ref> Football continued to be played at the stadium, but a German bombing raid on Trafford Park on 22 December 1940 damaged the stadium to the extent that a Christmas day fixture against [[Stockport County F.C.|Stockport County]] had to be switched to Stockport's ground.<ref name="mccartney_20"/> Football resumed at Old Trafford on 8 March 1941, but another German raid on 11 March 1941 destroyed much of the stadium, notably the main stand (now the South Stand), forcing the club's operations to move to Cornbrook Cold Storage, owned by United chairman [[James W. Gibson]].<ref name="mccartney_20"/> After pressure from Gibson, the [[War Damage Commission]] granted Manchester United <U+00A3>4,800 to remove the debris and <U+00A3>17,478 to rebuild the stands.<ref name="inglis_235"/> During the reconstruction of the stadium, Manchester United played their "home" games at [[Maine Road]], the home of their cross-town rivals, [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]], at a cost of <U+00A3>5,000 a year plus a percentage of the gate receipts.<ref>Murphy, p. 45</ref> The club was now <U+00A3>15,000 in debt, not helped by the rental of Maine Road, and the Labour MP for Stoke, [[Ellis Smith]], petitioned the Government to increase the club's compensation package, but it was in vain.<ref name="inglis_235"/> Though Old Trafford was reopened, albeit without cover, in 1949, it meant that a league game had not been played at the stadium for nearly 10 years.<ref>{{cite news |first=Robert |last=Philip |title=How Matt Busby arrived at Manchester United |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/2290610/How-Matt-Busby-arrived-at-Manchester-United.html |work=telegraph.co.uk |publisher=Telegraph Media Group |date=1 February 2008 |accessdate=21 August 2008 }}</ref> United's first game back at Old Trafford was played on 24 August 1949, as 41,748&nbsp;spectators witnessed a 3&ndash;0 victory over [[Bolton Wanderers F.C.|Bolton Wanderers]].<ref>White (2008), p. 224</ref>
[[File:Stretford end 1992.JPG|thumb|The Stretford End in the early 1990s]]

===Completion of the master plan===
A roof was restored to the Main Stand by 1951 and, soon after, the three remaining stands were covered, the operation culminating with the addition of a roof to the [[Stretford End]] (now the West Stand) in 1959.<ref name="rivalry"/> The club also invested <U+00A3>40,000 in the installation of proper [[floodlights (sport)|floodlighting]], so that they would be able to use the stadium for the European games that were played in the late evening of weekdays, instead of having to play at Maine Road. In order to avoid obtrusive shadows being cast on the pitch, two sections of the Main Stand roof were cut away.<ref name="inglis_235"/> The first match to be played under floodlights at Old Trafford was a First Division match between Manchester United and Bolton Wanderers on 25 March 1957.<ref name="encyclopedia"/>

However, although the spectators would now be able to see the players at night, they still suffered from the problem of obstructed views caused by the pillars that supported the roofs. With the [[1966 FIFA World Cup]] fast approaching, this prompted the United directors to completely redesign the United Road (north) stand. The old roof pillars were replaced in 1965 with modern-style cantilevering on top of the roof, allowing every spectator a completely unobstructed view,<ref name="rivalry"/> while it was also expanded to hold 20,000 spectators (10,000 seated and 10,000 standing in front) at a cost of <U+00A3>350,000.<ref name="inglis_236">Inglis, p. 236</ref> The architects of the new stand, Mather and Nutter (now Atherden Fuller),<ref name="encyclopedia"/> rearranged the organisation of the stand to have terracing at the front, a larger seated area towards the back, and the first [[luxury box|private boxes]] at a British football ground. The east stand <U+2013> the only remaining uncovered stand <U+2013> was developed in the same style in 1973.<ref>Inglis, p. 237</ref> With the first two stands converted to cantilevers, the club's owners devised a long-term plan to do the same to the other two stands and convert the stadium into a bowl-like arena.<ref name="manutdzone"/> Such an undertaking would serve to increase the atmosphere within the ground by containing the crowd's noise and focusing it onto the pitch, where the players would feel the full effects of a capacity crowd.<ref>{{cite news |first=Ben |last=Hibbs |title=OT atmosphere excites Ole |url=http://www.manutd.com/default.sps?newsid=355029&page=1&pagegid={B4CEE8FA-9A47-47BC-B069-3F7A2F35DB70} |work=ManUtd.com |publisher=Manchester United |date=15 August 2006 |accessdate=7 February 2008 }}</ref> Meanwhile, the stadium hosted its third FA Cup Final, hosting 62,078 spectators for the replay of the [[1970 FA Cup Final|1970 final]] between Chelsea and [[Leeds United A.F.C.|Leeds United]]. Chelsea won the match 2&ndash;1. The 1970s saw the dramatic rise of football hooliganism in Britain,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.liv.ac.uk/footballindustry/hooligan.html |title=University of Liverpool FIG Factsheet - Hooliganism |accessdate=4 September 2008 |last=Pearson |first=Geoff |year=2007 |month=December |work=Football Industry Group |publisher=University of Liverpool }}</ref> and when Manchester United were relegated to the [[Football League Second Division|Second Division]] in 1974, the club's [[hooligan firm]] &ndash; the [[Red Army (football)|Red Army]] &ndash; gained notoriety, a knife-throwing incident in 1971 forcing the club to erect the country's first perimeter fence, restricting fans from the Old Trafford pitch.<ref name="inglis_236"/>

1973 saw the completion of the roof around the circumference of the stadium, along with the addition of 5,500 seats to the Scoreboard End and the replacement of the old manual scoreboard with an electronic one in the north-east corner. Then, in 1975, a <U+00A3>3&nbsp;million expansion was begun, starting with the addition of the Executive Suite to the Main Stand. The suite's restaurant overlooked the pitch, but the view was still obstructed by the roof pillars. Therefore, in kind with the roofs of the United Road Stand and the Scoreboard End, the Main Stand roof was replaced with a cantilever design. The Executive Suite and cantilever roof were then extended to the full length of the stand, allowing for the relocation of the club offices from the south-east corner to the Main Stand. The south-east quadrant was then removed and replaced in 1985 with a seated section bringing the total [[seating capacity]] of the stadium to 25,686 (56,385 overall). The completion of the cantilever roof around three sides of the stadium allowed for the replacement of the old floodlight pylons, and the attachment of a row of floodlights around the inner rim of the roof in 1987.

===Conversion to all-seater===
With every subsequent improvement made to the ground since the Second World War, the capacity steadily declined. By the 1980s, the capacity had dropped from the original 80,000 to approximately 60,000. The capacity dropped still further in 1990, when the [[Taylor Report]] recommended, and the government demanded that all First and Second Division stadia be converted to [[all-seater stadium|all-seaters]]. This meant that <U+00A3>3<U+2013>5&nbsp;million plans to replace the Stretford End with a brand new stand with an all-standing terrace at the front and a cantilever roof to link with the rest of the ground had to be scrapped.<ref name="encyclopedia"/> This forced redevelopment, including the removal of the terraces at the front of the other three stands, not only increased the cost to around <U+00A3>10&nbsp;million, but also reduced the capacity of Old Trafford to an all-time low of about 44,000.<ref name="inglis_238">Inglis, p. 238</ref> In addition, the club was told in 1992 that they would only receive <U+00A3>1.4&nbsp;million of a possible <U+00A3>2&nbsp;million from the Football Trust to be put towards work related to the Taylor Report.<ref>Inglis, pp. 238<U+2013>239</ref>

[[File:Old Traford.jpg|thumb|left|The redeveloped East Stand was opened at the beginning of the 2000<U+2013>01 season.]]
The club's resurgence in success and increase in popularity in the early 1990s ensured that further development would have to occur. In 1995, construction began on a brand-new North Stand,<ref>{{cite book |last=James |first=Gary |title=Manchester <U+2013> A Football History |publisher=James Ward |location=Halifax |year=2008 |isbn=978-0-9558127-0-5 |pages=405<U+2013>6 }}</ref> to be ready in time for Old Trafford to host three group games, a quarter-final and a semi-final at [[UEFA Euro 1996|Euro 96]]. The club purchased the Trafford Park trading estate, a 20-acre site on the other site of United Road, for <U+00A3>9.2&nbsp;million in March 1995. Construction began at the end of the 1994<U+2013>95 season and was completed by May 1996. Designed by Atherden Fuller, with Hilstone Laurie as project and construction managers and Campbell Reith Hill as structural engineers, the new three-tiered stand cost a total of <U+00A3>18.65&nbsp;million to build and had a capacity of about 25,500, raising the capacity of the entire ground to approximately 55,000. The cantilever roof would also be the largest in Europe, measuring {{convert|58.5|m|ft|abbr=on}} from the back wall to the front edge.<ref name="inglis_239">Inglis, p. 239</ref> Further success over the next few years guaranteed yet more development. First, a second tier was added to the East Stand. Opened in January 2000, the stadium's capacity was temporarily increased to about 61,000 until the opening of the West Stand's second tier, which added yet another 7,000&nbsp;seats, bringing the capacity to 68,217.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.waterscape.com/in-your-area/lancashire/places-to-go/357/old-trafford |title=Old Trafford |accessdate=21 August 2008 |publisher=waterscape.com }}</ref> Old Trafford hosted its first major European final three years later, playing host to the [[2003 UEFA Champions League Final]] between [[A.C. Milan|Milan]] and [[Juventus F.C.|Juventus]].

From 2001 to 2007, following the demolition of the old Wembley Stadium, the [[England national football team]] was forced to play its games elsewhere. During that time, the team toured the country, playing their matches at various grounds from [[Villa Park]] in [[Birmingham]] to [[St James' Park]] in [[Newcastle upon Tyne|Newcastle]]. From 2003 to 2007, Old Trafford hosted 12 of England's 23&nbsp;home&nbsp;matches, more than any other stadium.

Old Trafford's most recent expansion, which took place between July 2005 and May 2006, saw an increase of around 8,000 seats with the addition of second tiers to both the north-west and north-east quadrants of the ground.<ref name="manutdzone"/> Part of the new seating was used for the first time on 26 March 2006, when an attendance of 69,070 became a new [[Premier League]] record.<ref>{{cite news |title=Match Report: United 3 Birmingham 0 |url=http://www.manutd.com/default.sps?pagegid={B4CEE8FA-9A47-47BC-B069-3F7A2F35DB70}&newsid=316812 |work=ManUtd.com |publisher=Manchester United |date=26 March 2006 |accessdate=7 February 2008 }}</ref> The record continued to be pushed upwards before reaching its current peak on 31 March 2007, when 76,098 spectators saw United beat [[Blackburn Rovers F.C.|Blackburn Rovers]] 4&ndash;1, meaning that just 114 seats (0.15% of the total capacity of 76,212) were left unoccupied.<ref>{{cite news |first=Nick |last=Coppack |title=Report: United 4 Blackburn 1 |url=http://www.manutd.com/default.sps?pagegid={B4CEE8FA-9A47-47BC-B069-3F7A2F35DB70}&newsid=414880 |work=ManUtd.com |publisher=Manchester United |date=31 March 2007 |accessdate=7 February 2008 }}</ref>

In 2009, a reorganisation of the seating in the stadium resulted in a reduction of the capacity by 415 to 75,797, meaning that the club's home attendance record would stand at least until the next expansion.<ref name="record_gate"/>

==Structure and facilities==
{{seealso|Stretford End}}
[[File:OldTraffordPlan.PNG|thumb|A plan of the layout of Old Trafford. The shaded area indicates the section designated for away fans.]]
The Old Trafford pitch is surrounded by four covered all-seater stands, officially known as the North, East, South and West Stands. Each stand has at least two tiers,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.manutd.com/default.sps?pagegid={CF7C77A4-0F8D-45BA-9561-EDFC1F9F2A13} |title=Seating Plan |accessdate=4 September 2008 |work=ManUtd.com |publisher=Manchester United }}</ref> with the exception of the South Stand, which only has one tier due to construction restrictions. The lower tier of each stand is split into Lower and Upper sections, the Lower sections having been converted from terracing in the early 1990s.

Formerly known as the United Road stand, the North Stand runs over the top of United Road. The stand is three tiers tall, and can hold about 26,000 spectators, the most of the four stands. The North Stand can also accommodate a few fans in executive boxes. The North Stand opened in its current state in 1996, having previously been a single-tiered stand. As the ground's main stand, the North Stand houses many of the ground's more popular facilities, including the Red Caf<U+00E9> (a Manchester United theme restaurant/bar) and the Manchester United museum and trophy room. Originally opened in 1986 as the first of its kind in the world,<ref>Inglis, p. 240</ref> the Manchester United museum was in the south-east corner of the ground until it moved to the redeveloped North Stand in 1998. The museum was opened on 11 April 1998 by [[Pel<U+00E9>]] and, according to the club's website, it attracts more than 200,000&nbsp;visitors every year.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.manutd.com/default.sps?pagegid={3D311A73-611A-43C9-9852-82DF97917873}&section=museum |title=The Museum |accessdate=21 January 2008 |work=Virtual Tour |work=ManUtd.com |publisher=Manchester United }}</ref>

Opposite the North Stand is the South Stand, formerly Old Trafford's main stand. Although only a single-tiered stand, the South Stand contains most of the ground's executive suites,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.manutd.com/default.sps?pagegid={CF108CDD-691C-4DC3-8256-0A09084E1D60}&page=1 |title=The Suites |accessdate=7 February 2008 |work=ManUtd.com |publisher=Manchester United }}</ref> and also plays host to any VIPs who may come to watch the match. Members of the media are seated in the middle of the Upper South Stand to give them the best view of the match. The television gantry is also in the South Stand, so the South Stand is the one that gets shown on television least often.<ref name="rivalry"/> Television studios are located at either end of the South Stand, with the club's in-house television station, [[Manchester United TV|MUTV]], in the East studio and other television stations, such as the [[BBC]] and [[British Sky Broadcasting|Sky]], in the West studio.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.manutd.com/default.sps?pagegid=%7BFE57ABE4-159E-491A-89A8-4F7707D76497%7D&section=tvStudio |title=TV Studio |accessdate=7 January 2008 |work=Match Day Hospitality |work=ManUtd.com |publisher=Manchester United }}</ref>

The dugout is in the centre of the South Stand, raised above pitch level to give the manager and his coaches an elevated view of the game. Each team's dugout flanks the old players' tunnel, which was used until 1993. The old tunnel is the only remaining part of the original 1910 stadium, having survived the bombing that destroyed much of the stadium during the Second World War.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.manutd.com/default.sps?pagegid={3D311A73-611A-43C9-9852-82DF97917873}&section=dugout |title=Dugout |accessdate=7 February 2008 |work=Virtual Tour |work=ManUtd.com |publisher=Manchester United }}</ref> On 6 February 2008, the tunnel was renamed the Munich Tunnel, as a memorial for the 50th anniversary of the 1958 [[Munich air disaster]].<ref>{{cite news |title=Football honours Munich victims |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/7228670.stm |work=BBC Sport |publisher=BBC |date=6 February 2008 |accessdate=7 February 2008 }}</ref> The current tunnel is in the South-West corner of the ground, and doubles as an entrance for the emergency services. In the event that large vehicles require access, the seating above the tunnel can be raised by up to {{convert|25|ft|m|1}}.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.manutd.com/default.sps?pagegid={3D311A73-611A-43C9-9852-82DF97917873}&section=playerTunnel |title=Player's Tunnel |accessdate=7 February 2008 |work=Virtual Tour |work=ManUtd.com |publisher=Manchester United }}</ref> The tunnel leads up to the players' dressing room, via the television interview area, and the players' lounge.
[[File:Stretford End.jpg|thumb|The West Stand, with its mosaic of seats displaying the stand's colloquial name]]

Perhaps the best-known stand at Old Trafford is the West Stand, also known as the [[Stretford End]]. Traditionally, the stand is where the hard-core United fans are located, and also the ones who make the most noise.<ref>{{cite news |first=Glenn |last=Moore |title=Football: You only sing when you're standing |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4158/is_19961119/ai_n14078746 |publisher=Independent, The |location=London |date=19 November 1996 |accessdate=22 August 2008 }}</ref> Originally designed to hold 20,000&nbsp;fans, the Stretford End was the last stand to be covered and also the last remaining all-terraced stand at the ground before the forced upgrade to seating in the early 1990s. The reconstruction of the Stretford End, which took place during the [[1992<U+2013>93 in English football|1992<U+2013>93 season]], was carried out by [[Alfred McAlpine]].<ref>{{cite news |title=Alfred McAlpine wins <U+00A3>7.2m contract to redevelop Stretford End at Manchester United FC's stadium |url=http://www.cnplus.co.uk/News/1992/05/28may92_uk_alfred_mcalpine_wins_72m_contract_to_redevelop_stretford_end_at_manchester_united_fcs_stadium.html |publisher=The Construction News |date=28 May 1992 |accessdate=21 August 2008 }}</ref> When the second tier was added to the Stretford End in 2000, many fans from the old "K Stand" moved there, and decided to hang banners and flags from the barrier at the front of the tier. So ingrained in Manchester United culture is the Stretford End, that [[Denis Law]] was given the nickname "King of the Stretford End", and there is now a statue of Law on the concourse of the stand's upper tier.<ref>{{cite news |author=Communications Department |title=Denis Law statue unveiled |url=http://www.manutd.com/default.sps?pagegid={B4CEE8FA-9A47-47BC-B069-3F7A2F35DB70}&newsid=13552&page=1 |work=ManUtd.com |publisher=Manchester United |date=22 February 2002 |accessdate=21 August 2008 }}</ref>

The Manchester United club shop has had six different locations since it was first opened. Originally, the shop was a small hut near to the railway line that runs alongside the ground. The shop was then moved along the length of the South Stand, stopping first opposite where away fans enter the ground, and then residing in the building that would later become the club's merchandising office. A surge in the club's popularity in the early 1990s led to another move, this time to the forecourt of the West Stand. With this move came a great expansion and the conversion from a small shop to a "megastore". Alex Ferguson opened the new megastore on 3 December 1994.<ref>White (2008), p. 319</ref> The most recent moves came in the late 1990s, as the West Stand required room to expand to a second tier, and that meant the demolition of the megastore. The store was moved to a temporary site opposite the East Stand, before taking up a {{convert|17000|sqft|m2}} permanent residence in the ground floor of the expanded East Stand in 2000.<ref>{{cite book |last=Mitten |first=Andy |title=The Man Utd Miscellany |year=2007 |publisher=Vision Sports Publishing |location=London |isbn=978-1-905326-27-3 |page=137 }}</ref> The floor space of the current megastore is actually owned by United's kit sponsors, [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]], who operate the store.
[[File:MunichMemorialPlaqueeditJM.jpg|thumb|left|A plaque at Old Trafford commemorating the [[Munich air disaster]]]]

The East Stand at Old Trafford was the second to be converted to a cantilever roof, following the North Stand. It is also commonly referred to as the Scoreboard End, as it was the location of the scoreboard. The East Stand can currently hold nearly 12,000&nbsp;fans,<ref name="manutdzone"/> and is the location of both the disabled fans section and the away section. The disabled section provides for up to 170 fans, with free seats for carers. Old Trafford was formerly divided into sections, with each section sequentially assigned a letter of the alphabet. Although every section had a letter, it is the K Stand that is the most commonly referred to today. The K Stand fans were renowned for their vocal support for the club, and a large array of chants and songs, though many of them have relocated to the second tier of the West Stand.<ref>{{cite news |first=Glenn |last=Moore |title=Football: You only sing when you're standing |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4158/is_19961119/ai_n14078746 |work=The Independent |location=London |date=19 November 1996 |accessdate=8 February 2008 }}</ref> The East Stand has a tinted glass fa<U+00E7>ade, behind which the club's administrative centre is located. These offices are the home to the staff of Inside United, the official Manchester United magazine, the club's official website, and its other administrative departments. Images and advertisements are often emblazoned on the front of the East Stand, most often advertising Nike products, though a tribute to the [[Busby Babes]] was displayed in February 2008 to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the Munich air disaster. Above the megastore is a statue of [[Matt Busby|Sir Matt Busby]], Manchester United's longest-serving manager to date. There is also a plaque dedicated to the victims of the Munich air disaster on the south end of the East Stand, while the Munich Clock is at the junction of the East and South Stands.<ref name="encyclopedia"/> On 29 May 2008, to celebrate the 40th anniversary of Manchester United's first European Cup title, a statue of the club's "holy trinity" of [[George Best]], Denis Law and [[Bobby Charlton]], entitled "The United Trinity", was unveiled across [[Sir Matt Busby Way]] from the East Stand, directly opposite the statue of Busby.<ref>{{cite news |first=Ben |last=Hibbs |title=United Trinity honoured |url=http://www.manutd.com/default.sps?pagegid={B4CEE8FA-9A47-47BC-B069-3F7A2F35DB70}&newsid=6610438 |work=ManUtd.com |publisher=Manchester United |date=29 May 2008 |accessdate=26 June 2009 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Man Utd 'trinity' statue unveiled |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/manchester/7426075.stm |work=BBC News |publisher=BBC |date=29 May 2008 |accessdate=30 May 2008 }}</ref>

In the mid-1980s, when Manchester United Football Club owned [[Manchester Giants|Manchester's basketball franchise]], there were plans to build a 9,000-seater indoor arena on the site of what is now Car Park E1. However, the chairman at the time, [[Martin Edwards]], did not have the funds to take on such a project, and the basketball franchise was eventually sold.<ref>Mitten, p. 122</ref> In August 2009, the car park became home to the [[Hublot]] clock tower, a {{convert|10|m|ftin|adj=on}}-tall tower in the shape of the Hublot logo, which houses four {{convert|2|m|ftin|adj=on}}-diameter clock faces, the largest ever made by the company.<ref>{{cite news |title=Hublot clock unveiled |url=http://www.manutd.com/default.sps?pagegid={B4CEE8FA-9A47-47BC-B069-3F7A2F35DB70}&newsid=6638590 |work=ManUtd.com |publisher=Manchester United |date=28 August 2009 |accessdate=4 September 2009 }}</ref>

==Future==
United continue to harbour plans to increase the capacity of the stadium further, with the next stage pointing to a redevelopment of the South Stand, which, unlike the rest of the stadium, remains single tier. A replication of the North Stand development and North-East and -West Quadrants would see the stadium's capacity rise to an estimated 95,000, which would give it a greater capacity than [[Wembley Stadium]].<ref name="Telegraph">{{cite news |title=Manchester United set to make Old Trafford bigger than Wembley |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/leagues/premierleague/manutd/5276996/Manchester-United-set-to-make-Old-Trafford-bigger-than-Wembley.html |work=Telegraph.co.uk |publisher=Telegraph Media Group |date=5 May 2009 |accessdate=5 May 2009 }}</ref> Any such development is likely to cost around <U+00A3>100m, due to the proximity of the railway line that runs adjacent to the stadium, and the corresponding need to build over it and thus purchase up to 50 houses on the other side of the railway.<ref name="manutdzone"/> Nevertheless, the Manchester United group property manager confirmed that expansion plans are in the pipeline - linked to profits made from the club's property holdings around Manchester - saying "There is a strategic plan for the stadium... It is not our intention to stand still".<ref>{{cite news |title=Watch out Wembley: Manchester United chiefs plan to dwarf National Stadium with 95,000 expansion of Old Trafford |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-1177346/United-chiefs-plan-dwarf-Wembley-95-000-expansion-Old-Trafford.html |work=Mail Online |publisher=Associated Newspapers |date=5 May 2009 |accessdate=5 May 2009 }}</ref> One criticism of the plans, however, is that increasing the height of the South Stand would further reduce the amount of light coming onto the pitch, which has caused problems in similarly large stadia <U+2013> such as [[Wembley Stadium]], the [[Santiago Bernab<U+00E9>u Stadium]] and the [[San Siro]]; according to [[Alex Ferguson]], the developments on the other stands have already caused problems.<ref>{{cite news |title=Fergie wants 'awful' Old Trafford pitch dug and relaid in time for Manchester derby |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-511255/Fergie-wants-awful-Old-Trafford-pitch-dug-relaid-time-Manchester-derby.html |work=Mail Online |publisher=Associated Newspapers |date=30 January 2008 |accessdate=17 May 2009 }}</ref>

It has been suggested that, should such an expansion take place, Old Trafford could be used instead of Wembley for big matches such as [[England national football team|England internationals]] - in order to increase the ability of fans in the north of the country to watch England play <U+2013> and [[FA Cup]] semi-finals - to maintain the prestige of the national stadium for the final.<ref>{{cite news |author=Hatchet Man |title=Bigger than Wembley and more convenient - why a revamped Old Trafford must stage the top games |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-1177537/HATCHET-MAN-Bigger-Wembley-convenient--revamped-Old-Trafford-stage-games.html |work=Mail Online |publisher=Associated Newspapers |date=5 May 2009 |accessdate=5 May 2009 }}</ref>
