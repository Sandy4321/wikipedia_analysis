'''Wilhelm-Ferdinand "Wutz" Galland''' (born 23 October 1914 in [[Bochum]] <U+2013> [[killed in action]] 17 August 1943) was a [[Germany|German]] ''[[Luftwaffe]]'' [[fighter ace]] and recipient of the [[Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross]]. He is credited with 55 aerial victories achieved in 186 combat missions. All his victories were claimed over the [[Western Front (World War II)|Western Front]] and included seven four-engine bombers and 37 [[Supermarine Spitfires]].

Wilhelm-Ferdinand Galland was one of four Galland brothers to serve in the ''Luftwaffe''. The eldest brother Fritz Galland served in a fighter and reconnaissance unit and survived the war. Wilhelm-Ferdinand's older brother, Lt. General [[Adolf Galland]] was one the most renowned German fighter pilots and leader of German fighter operations; and also survived the war. His younger brother [[Paul Galland]], a flying ace with 17 victories, served with [[JG 26]] and was killed in action on 31 October 1942.

Galland scored his first victory on 23 July 1941, shooting down a Spitfire near [[Hesdin]]. By the end of 1941 his victory total was three. On 5 May 1942 Galland was promoted to  ''Staffelkapit<U+00E4>n'' of 5./JG 26, with eight victories at the time. His score was 21 by the end of 1942. Hpt. Galland was appointed ''Gruppenkommandeur'' of II./JG 26 in January 1943. Galland was awarded the [[Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross]] in May 1943 for 35 victories.

Galland was [[killed in action]] on 17 August 1943 during the [[Schweinfurt-Regensburg mission]]. II./JG 26 took off on a bomber intercept mission and engaged the [[Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress]] bomber formation but the German aircraft were intercepted by escorting [[Republic P-47 Thunderbolt]] fighters from the 56th Fighter Group, [[United States Army Air Forces]]. It is assumed that Galland was shot down by the American ace [[Bud Mahurin|Walker "Bud" Mahurin]] of the [[56th Fighter Group]].
