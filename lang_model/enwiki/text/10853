'''James the Deacon''' (died after 671 AD) was an [[Italian people|Italian]] [[deacon]] who accompanied [[Paulinus of York]] on his mission to [[Northumbria]]. He was a member of the [[Gregorian mission]] which came to England to convert the [[Anglo-Saxons]] to Christianity, although when he arrived in England is unknown. After Paulinus left Northumbria, James stayed near Lincoln and continued his missionary efforts, dying  sometime after 671 according to the medieval chronicler [[Bede]].

==Life==

James was presumably an Italian, like the other members of the [[Gregorian mission]].<ref name=BASE/> The dates of his birth and of his arrival in Britain are unknown.<ref name=World98>Blair ''World of Bede'' p. 98</ref> He went with Paulinus to Northumbria accompanying [[<U+00C6>thelburg of Kent|<U+00C6>thelburg]], sister of King [[Eadbald of Kent]], who went  to [[Northumbria]] to marry King [[Edwin of Northumbria|Edwin]]. Traditionally this event is dated to 625, but the historian D. P. Kirby argues that the mission to Northumbria probably happened before 619.<ref name=Coming66>Mayr-Harting ''Coming of Christianity'' pp. 66<U+2013>67</ref>
 
Edwin died in battle at [[Battle of Hatfield Chase|Hatfield]] fighting against [[Penda of Mercia]] and [[Cadwallon ap Cadfan|Caedwalla]] in 633.<ref name=Coming68>Mayr-Harting ''Coming of Christianity'' p. 68</ref> Edwin had been the main supporter of Paulinus' mission, and with his death, a pagan backlash set in. Paulinus fled to Kent, along with  <U+00C6>thelburg and Edwin and <U+00C6>thelburg's daughter [[Eanfl<U+00E6>d]]. James, however, remained behind in Northumbria and continued missionary efforts.<ref name=Coming68/> James' efforts were centred in Lincoln, at a church that Paulinus had built there, the remains of which may lie under the church of St. Paul-in-the-Bail.<ref name=Brooks22>Brooks "From British to English Christianity" ''Conversion and Colonization'' p. 22</ref> This was in the dependent [[Kingdom of Lindsey|kingdom of Lindsey]], where Paulinus had preached prior to Edwin's death,<ref name=Kirby65>Kirby ''Earliest English Kings'' p. 65</ref> and it was reconquered by one of Edwin's successors, [[Oswald of Northumbria]] in the 640s.<ref name=Kirby74>Kirby ''Earliest English Kings'' p. 74</ref>

Bede writes that James lived in a village near [[Catterick]], which "bears his name to this day".<ref name=Bede139>Bede ''History'' p. 139</ref> He reports that James undertook missionary work in the area and lived to a great age.<ref name=BASE/> During the reign of King [[Oswiu of Northumbria]], James attended the royal court, for he celebrated Easter with Oswiu's queen, Eanfl<U+00E6>d, Edwin's daughter. Both James and Eanfl<U+00E6>d celebrated Easter on the date used by the Roman church, which led to conflicts with Oswiu, who celebrated Easter on the date calculated by the Irish church. These dates did not always agree, and was one of the reasons that Oswiu called the [[Synod of Whitby]] in 664 to decide which system of Easter calculation his kingdom would use.<ref name=Kirby87>Kirby ''Earliest English Kings'' p. 87</ref>

James was present at the Synod of Whitby, according to Bede's account of events there.<ref name=BASE>Lapidge "James the Deacon" ''Blackwell Encyclopedia of Anglo-Saxon England''</ref>{{#tag:ref|[[Eddius Stephanus]]' ''Life of  Wilfred'' does not mention James in his account of the synod.<ref name=Eddi>Eddius Stephanus ''Life of Wilfrid'' pp. 116<U+2013>118</ref>|group=notes}} Bede states that after the synod, and the return of Roman customs, James, as a trained singing master in the Roman and Kentish style, taught many people [[plainsong]] or [[Gregorian chant]] in the Roman manner.<ref name=BASE/>

His date of death is unknown, but Bede implies that he was still alive during Bede's lifetime, which presumably means that he died after Bede's birth, sometime around 671 or 672. This would mean that he was at least 70 years old at his death.<ref name=World98/> It has been suggested that James was Bede's informant for the life of Edwin, the works of Paulinus, and perhaps for the [[Synod of Whitby]].<ref>Higham, p. 107</ref> The historian Frank Stenton calls James "the one heroic figure in the Roman mission".<ref>Stenton ''Anglo-Saxon England'' p. 116</ref> This reflects the fact that many of the Gregorian missionaries had a habit of fleeing when things went wrong.<ref name=Coming75>Mayr-Harting ''Coming of Christianity'' p. 75</ref>

After his death, he was venerated as a saint. His feast day is 17 August (Catholic)<ref name=PSI>{{cite web|url=http://saints.sqpn.com/saintj1x.htm|title=St James the Deacon|publisher=Patron Saints Index}} Accessed 11 March 2009</ref> or 11 October (Anglican).<ref name=Church/>
