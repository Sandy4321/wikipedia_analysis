'''Arawashi Tsuyoshi''' (<U+8352><U+9DF2> <U+6BC5>) is a professional sumo wrestler from Mongolia. He was the 21st Mongolian to reach the top division. His 68 tournament rise through the ranks is the second slowest progress for a foreign wrestler after [[Sent<U+014D>ry<U+016B>]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Sadanoumi is the eighth son of a former makuuchi wrestler to enter makuuchi|url=[http://www.nikkansports.com/sports/sumo/news/f-sp-tp3-20140424-1289890.html|publisher=nikkan sports}}</ref>

==Early life and sumo experience==
In his childhood he was active in sports such as basketball and swimming.  He also lived in Indonesia for a time in his younger years.  At the 2002 junior sumo tournament, he impressed then active [[Kyokush<U+016B>zan]] with his ability and soon afterward he entered [[Araiso stable]].  He debuted in November of that same year in [[maezum<U+014D>]] at the height of 183 centimeters and weighing 83 kilograms.<ref name="yomiuri">{{cite journal|title=Yomiuri Grand Sumo|volume=2008 October}}</ref>

==Career==
From his November 2002, he rose slowly but steadily through the ranks over three years, recording mostly winning tournaments.  However in the January 2006 tournament he dislocated his left shoulder and had to drop out. He also missed the following tournament.  After this his shoulder became prone to dislocating and upon his 7th dislocation he elected to finally have corrective surgery upon completing the May 2007 tournament.  Rehabilitation from the surgery forced him to sit out three tournaments. He dropped from [[makushita]] 22 down to [[jonidan]] 22 in this period. During this time he studied the techniques of former [[yokozuna]] [[Chiyonofuji]] who long suffered from an easily dislocated shoulder. Upon his return in January 2008, his sumo was back in form and he recorded three 6-1 tournaments in a row. However, in September of that year, Araiso stable closed upon the retirement of its owner, the former [[Futagodake Takeshi|Futagodake]]. While the other wrestlers in the stable chose to retire, he chose to remain active and transferred to [[Hanaregoma stable]].<ref name="yomiuri"/> He continued his steady rise through the ranks, recording only one or two losing tournaments a year.  In the May 2011 technical tournament which was not televised due to the ramifications of widespread [[Match-fixing in professional sumo|match-fixing]] he managed only a 3-4 record at [[makushita]] 3. This normally would have led to a drop in rank. However, he was one of a number of wrestlers who benefited from the dismissal of several high ranking wrestlers for match-fixing and he was actually promoted to the salaried [[j<U+016B>ry<U+014D>]] for the first time in his career in the July 2011 tournament.<ref>{{cite web|title=13 Wrestlers rise to j<U+016B>ry<U+014D>! Arawashi and Kakizoe with losing records also promoted!|website=http://www.sponichi.co.jp/sports/news/2011/05/26/kiji/K20110526000894120.html|publisher=Supo Nichi}}</ref>  He only managed a 5-10 record at ''j<U+016B>ry<U+014D>'' 13 and was demoted back to ''makushita'' 3.  He repeated this same feat twice more, taking a number of tournaments to rise to ''j<U+016B>ry<U+014D>'' and being relegated after a single losing tournament back to the unsalaried ''makushita'' division. During this period, in 2012, the stable he had transferred to,''Hanaregoma'', had to close due to financial difficulties. He then transferred to [[Minezaki stable]].  Starting in the September 2013 tournament he begin to be more consistent, and posted two strong 6-1 tournaments in a row to achieve promotion to ''j<U+016B>ry<U+014D>'' for the fourth time in the January 2014 tournament. He debuted at a then career high rank of ''j<U+016B>ry<U+014D>'' 10 and managed an 8-7 record. A 10-5 record in the following March tournament garnered him his first promotion to the [[makuuchi]] top division for the May 2014 tournament. He was the 21st Mongolian to make it to the top division following [[Terunofuji]].  At the beginning of his career, Arawashi had entered sumo at the same time as [[Koto<U+014D>sh<U+016B>]] but was soon left behind as Koto<U+014D>sh<U+016B> made one of the fastest ever rises to ''makuuchi'' and ultimately [[<U+014D>zeki]].  Arawashi had stated that one of his goals was to make it to ''makuuchi'' and once again face Koto<U+014D>sh<U+016B> in the ring. However, he would never realize this goal, as [[Koto<U+014D>sh<U+016B>]] retired, his name being taken off the [[banzuke]] the same tournament that Arawashi's was added to ''makuuchi''. Arawashi has since alternated winning and losing tournaments and it remains to be seen whether he can become a fixture in the top division.
