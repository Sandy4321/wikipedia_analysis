Originally designed by [[Yoshitaka Amano]], he appears in ''[[Final Fantasy VI]]'' as a [[clown]]-like, [[nihilism|nihilistic]] [[psychopathy|psychopath]] who acts as the game's main antagonist and as the God of Magic, physically transforming into a [[Lucifer]]-esque fallen angel. 

He is present in the spinoff [[fighting game]]s ''[[Dissidia Final Fantasy]]'' and ''[[Dissidia 012 Final Fantasy]]'', wherein he is voiced by [[Shigeru Chiba]] in Japanese and [[Dave Wittenberg]] in English. He also appeared in ''[[Theatrhythm Final Fantasy]]'', ''Final Fantasy Artniks'', and ''[[Final Fantasy: All the Bravest]]'' as an enemy boss.

Kefka has been rated one of the most memorable and evil video game villains ever created, with critics and fans noting his intense hatred and maniacal laughter as defining characteristics. He has been compared to [[the Joker]] from [[Batman]] and been called the ''Final Fantasy'' series' greatest villain.

==Attributes==
===Character design===
Kefka's appearance was designed by [[Yoshitaka Amano]], who was given complete creative freedom in ''Final Fantasy VI'' with only brief character outlines as guidelines and designed the characters to feel "alive" within his imagination though with consideration for the representation as small computer [[sprite (graphics)|sprites]].<ref name="creation"/> Kefka is well known for his clown-like apparel, which has been compared to the [[Joker (comics)|Joker]] from ''[[Batman]]''.<ref name="alot"/> His dress has been described as "garish", with "makeup smeared across his face" and "a shrill, girlish laughter" that is thought to "punctuate his madness".<ref name="camp"/><ref name="eighteen"/>

===Personality===
Given only the artwork and outline to work with during production, writer [[Yoshinori Kitase]] felt that one early scene of Kefka's approach of a castle was too "boring to make completely normal" and decided to [[ad-lib]] a scene where he requests that his accompanying soldiers dust off his boots in the middle of a desert.<ref name="strange"/> The scene set the tone for his personality from that point onwards, suggesting that there "may be a screw or two missing from this character's head".<ref name="strange"/> He has been described as "powerful" and "manipulative", though he is retiring on occasion when confronted by opposition and even called a coward for his delegating.<ref name="alot"/> He is also known for his sarcastic tone and one-liners.<ref name="readerschoice"/> As Kefka's power grows, his nihilism and madness grow in tandem and, as he attains godlike powers he thirsts for the destruction of all life, expresses his loathing of everything in existence by chanting the word "hate" to his enemies.<ref name="camp"/> In his Dissidia appearance, Kefka's insanity is further explored, suggesting that his actions stem from a desire to fill his heart with destruction when love failed to provide his life with meaning.<ref name=alternate/> ''Final Fantasy VI'' features a song called "Kefka", which exemplifies the "sadistic joy" of the character.<ref name="eighteen"/> His laughter has been called the greatest video game laughter of all time.<ref name="laugh"/>

==Appearances==
===Final Fantasy VI===
Kefka first appears as a general under the game's primary antagonist [[Characters of Final Fantasy VI#Emperor Gestahl|Emperor Gestahl]], serving as his court [[Magician (fantasy)|mage]].<ref name="alot"/> Prior to the start of the game, he was the first human to be experimentally infused with the [[Gameplay of Final Fantasy#Magic|magic]]-like craft "Magitek," which granted him the ability to wield magic, although the imperfect process warped his mind and made him into the [[Nihilism|nihilistic]] [[psychopath]] he is during the course of the game.<ref name="Vector"/> Through the first half of the game, Kefka leads the charge for the city-state of Vector to conquer the world, one kingdom at a time, using their magic weapons.<ref name="igns"/> Kefka mentally enslaves [[Terra Branford|Terra]] and uses her to lead an attack on the town of Narshe to claim the frozen [[esper]] there.<ref name="alot"/><ref name="Slave Crown"/> When she escapes Imperial control, he pursues Terra to the kingdom of Figaro, setting the castle ablaze as she, [[Characters of Final Fantasy VI#Locke|Locke]] and [[Characters of Final Fantasy VI#Edgar|King Edgar]] flee.

During a siege on the kingdom of Doma, Kefka grows impatient with fellow Imperial General Leo and poisons the drinking water in the castle of Doma, resulting in mass casualties and a swift victory for the Empire.<ref name="eighteen"/><ref name="hatred"/> After the alliance of Espers and revolutionaries invade and destroy Vector, Gestahl feigns sorrow for the Empire's evils, and to gain the trust of the protagonists, Gestahl has Kefka imprisoned, citing the poisoning of Doma. Kefka later goes to the village of Thamasa to kill the espers congregated there, killing Leo when he tries to intervene.<ref name="leo"/><ref name="eighteen"/><ref name="espers"/> Using the power of the espers, Kefka helps Gestahl raise the espers' homeworld and create the Floating Continent, where they intend to awaken three entities known as the Warring Triad.<ref name="big boss"/> Upon being confronted by the protagonists, Gestahl freezes them except for former Imperial general [[Characters of Final Fantasy VI#Celes|Celes]], whom he orders to kill her friends to show her loyalty to the Empire. She instead stabs Kefka, who becomes enraged. Kefka and the Emperor then get in an argument as to what degree they will wield the power of the triad<U+2014>the Emperor taking a more conservative approach, since he only wants enough power to rule the world, while Kefka wants to unleash the Warring Triad's full potential. The Emperor tries and fails to kill Kefka, who retaliates by having the Warring Triad strike Gestahl down and unceremoniously boots him off the Floating Continent to his death.<ref name="big boss"/> Kefka then moves the statues of the Warring Triad out of balance, unleashing enough raw magical energy to reshape the face of the planet and bringing about the second act of the game.<ref name="ruin"/>

Imbued with the power of the statues, Kefka becomes the god of the ruined world he created, using the statues to forge a massive tower of random debris to serve as his headquarters.<ref name="eighteen"/> Kefka smites the millions who refuse to worship him with his "Light of Judgment", a beam of incinerating light capable of cutting fissures into the planet's surface.<ref name="big boss"/> Confronted by the protagonists at the game's conclusion, Kefka reveals his nihilistic motivations: when the protagonists reject his claims, Kefka goes berserk and proclaims his desire to eradicate everything.<ref name="destroy"/><ref name="powerself"/> Upon the defeat of his minions, Kefka reveals his godlike form and, after uttering one final nihilistic vision of life, dreams and hope,<ref name="meaningless"/> attacks the protagonists before he is ultimately dispatched, causing the power of magic to vanish.<ref name="big boss"/>

===Other games===
Kefka is the villain representing ''Final Fantasy VI'' in ''[[Dissidia Final Fantasy]]'', where the gods Cosmos and Chaos are fighting a cosmic war for control, with Kefka on the side of chaos.<ref name="spies"/> During the Destiny Odyssey sequence, Kefka allies himself with the Cloud of Darkness to bring Terra to their side because of her Esper powers, hoping to use the girl for his own scheme to destroy everything. However, when Terra refuses to aid him and learned to control her powers, Kefka attempts to kill her and ends up being defeated with Terra gaining her crystal. During the Shade Impulse sequence, after mocking the heroes as they almost faded, Kefka breaks his ties to the other villains and starts his own scheme to become the ruler of the ruined world before being ultimately dispatched for good.  Kefka is voiced by [[Shigeru Chiba]], who ad-libbed many lines, including shouting seafood words like "Pike!" "Yellowtail!"<ref name="dissideas"/>

Along with the entire cast of the first ''Dissidia'' game, Kefka appears in the prequel ''[[Dissidia 012 Final Fantasy]]''.<ref name="Dissidia012"/> Holding control over Terra's mind, Kefka uses her to fight until [[Characters of Final Fantasy IX#Kuja|Kuja]] weakens his spell, allowing Terra to resist him. [[Vaan]] finds Kefka torturing her and helps Terra escape, Kefka's spell eventually breaking as they leave him behind. Kefka later confronts the heroes with other Warriors of Chaos to stop them from closing the portal the Manikins are emerging from, but is defeated by Vaan. Kefka received a considerable amount of work and changes according to producer [[Tetsuya Nomura]] and planning director Mitsunori Takahashi.<ref name="changes"/> Translator Tom Slattery, who worked on ''Final Fantasy VI Advance'' for the [[Game Boy Advance]], enjoyed writing new dialogue for Kefka.<ref name="dised"/> Director Takahashi Mitsunori said he felt that developing Kefka's attacks such as "reverse magic" felt similar to development of the recurring minor character Gilgamesh's attacks, and that the staff enjoyed brainstorming the moves.<ref name="gilga"/>

Kefka makes cameo appearances in ''[[Itadaki Street Portable]]'', ''[[Theatrhythm Final Fantasy]]'', and ''Final Fantasy: All the Bravest'' as an antagonist.<ref name="big boss"/><ref name="bravest"/><ref name="rhythm"/> He also appears as a "Most Wanted" villain in a [[GREE]] social network card game called "Final Fantasy Artniks", where players must share information to find and defeat Kefka to earn rewards.<ref name="Artniks"/>

==Analysis==
[[File:Angelkefka.png|right|thumb|Kefka as the God of Magic has been compared to depictions of [[Lucifer]]]]
[[Konami]] video game developer Tomm Hulett described Kefka as a pure villain, stating "Unlike most Japanese stories, Kefka did not have shades of gray. He didn't have a tragic past that turned him into a sadistic clown that you felt sorry for him over. He didn't have some greater purpose that he lost sight of. Yet, at the same time, he wasn't "evil for evil's sake." There was something twisted and nasty inside him that MADE him that way... and you could feel it... but you also knew there wasn't any good in there."<ref name="memory"/> That he is a central villain the entire game also serves to intensify a players negative fixation on him.<ref name="memory"/> In a review of ''Final Fantasy VI Advance'', [[IGN]] stated "it's the game's maniacal nihilist Kefka that really stands out.<ref name="igns"/> The most evil and destructive villain in the entire Final Fantasy franchise, Kefka's brutality and ruthlessness is unmatched and he has to be seen to be believed."<ref name="igns"/> [[IGN]] also noted his ability to "tap into primal, instinctive fears", including fears of clowns.<ref name="madness"/> [[CNet]] in their own review described him as "the unrivaled star of the show...he's the kind of villain that you will love to hate", comparing him to [[Jack Nicholson]]'s portrayal of the Joker and calling his laugh one of the greatest sound effects in any video game.<ref name="cnet"/> [[Kotaku]] has called Kefka the greatest video game villain of all time, and attempted to explain players' lasting fascination by noting that he inspires such hatred that when his evil plans are finally thwarted, the sense of joy from victory is so much the greater.<ref name="hatred"/> [[GameSpy]] compared Kefka's final form as a representation of [[Lucifer]], highlighted by his powerful "Fallen Angel" attack.<ref name="lucifer"/> Another theory posited by [[GameSpot]] is that the intense reaction to Kefka stems from the fact that he is one of the few villains in ''[[Final Fantasy]]'', or any game, that succeeds at his master plan before he is defeated.<ref name="writin"/>

You love and hate Kefka, but you surely think he's about as vile and evil as evil gets."<ref name="toptenvillians"/> In a similar article the boss battle against Kefka was voted by readers as one of the ten best in video games; GameSpot's staff noted "Kefka is one of the two bosses that won through the write-in ballot, meaning he wasn't on our main list of nominees.
