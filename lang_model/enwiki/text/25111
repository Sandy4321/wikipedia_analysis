'''Stronger than the Storm''' was advertising campaign to promote tourism in [[New Jersey]] in 2013. It portrayed the state as being resilient and having recovered from the impact of [[Hurricane Sandy]] and its aftermath which had caused severe damage in Autumn 2012. The [[media blitz]] included [[billboards]], [[radio spots]], and [[television commercials]] which featured the [[Jersey Shore]] and included appearances of the [[Governor of New Jersey]], [[Chris Christie]], and his wife and children. The [[United States Department of Housing and Urban Development]] (HUD) provided funding for the promotional campaign. The awarding of the contract to marketing firm [[MWW (company)|MWW]] and the appearance of Christie in the ads during his re-election campaign has drawn media and governmental scrutiny. In January 2014, HUD initiated an audit of the expenditure. The audit is one of two simultaneous federal inquiries involving the Chris administration use of Sandy funds begun in 2014.

==Sandy funding and bids==

==Production and release of TV ads==
[[MWW (company)|MWW]]'s plan included six TV and radio spots, billboards (at [[Times Square]] and the [[Lincoln Tunnel]], along other locations) a [[social media]] blitz, and [[jingle]]. The campaign targeted markets in New Jersey, New York City and state, Philadelphia and other parts of Pennsylvania, Baltimore, Washington, and eastern Canada.

MWW engaged a sub-contractor, Brushfire, Inc. to produce the TV commercials. Brushfire wrote the lyrics for the ''Stronger than the Storm'' theme song and New York-based songwriter Brian Jones of [[Bang (company)|Bang]] composed the music. The jingle for the 30-second television commercial was later turned it into a full-length single.<ref>{{cite news   | last = Izzo   | first = Michael Izzo   | title = Jersey pride on display in 'Stronger than the Storm'   | publisher = USA Today   | date = June 30, 2013   | url = http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2013/06/30/jersey-pride-stronger-than-storm/2477913/   | accessdate = 2014-02-14}}</ref>
