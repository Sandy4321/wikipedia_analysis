"'''D<U+00E9>j<U+00E0> Vu'''" is a song by American [[contemporary R&B|R&B]] singer [[Beyonc<U+00E9> Knowles]], featuring [[hip hop music|hip hop]] artist [[Jay-Z]]. It was produced by [[Rodney Jerkins|Rodney "Darkchild" Jerkins]] and Knowles for her second solo album, ''[[B'Day]]''. The song combines [[contemporary R&B]] and '70s [[funk]] and its varied instrumentation includes [[bass guitar]], [[hi-hat]], [[Brass instrument|horns]] and the [[Roland TR-808]] drum machine. The song's title and lyrics refer to a woman being constantly reminded of a past lover.

The song was released as the album's [[lead single]] in July 2006. Although it was recognized as "Best Song" at the 2006 [[MOBO Awards|Music Of Black Origin (MOBO) Awards]], "D<U+00E9>j<U+00E0> Vu" received mixed reviews from critics. The single entered the top ten on most charts, topping several of ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' magazine's [[component chart]]s and reaching number one in the United Kingdom. The single's [[music video]] displeased fans, thousands of whom petitioned for it to be re-shot, citing its sexual theme and Knowles' wardrobes, among other reasons.

==Background and production==
In 2005, American record producer and songwriter [[Rodney Jerkins]]<U+2014>who had previously worked with Knowles' former group [[Destiny's Child]]<U+2014>and composer John Webb "came up with the concept of doing an old-school track, a throwback with real bass and horns", to which the song's title is partly attributed.<ref name="Jisi">{{Cite web |last=Jisi |first=Chris |title=Jon Jon Webb<U+2019>s Complete Bass Line: Beyonce's Deja Vu |url=http://www.bassplayer.com/article/beyonces-deja-vu/dec-06/24360 |work=Bass Player |publisher=New Bay Media, LLC |month=December | year=2006 |accessdate=2008-01-07}}</ref> Playing the bass guitar, Webb, with Jerkins, first recorded the bass sections, onto which the percussion, horns and vocals were layered. Production took place in Jerkins' [[New Jersey]]-based studio, and [[Sony Music Studios]] in [[New York City]].

Jerkins recorded a [[demo (music)|demo]] version of the song with vocals by American songwriter Makeba Riddick, who is credited as co-writer.<ref name="Reid">{{Cite news |last=Reid |first=Shaheem |title=Be All You Can, B. |url=http://www.mtv.com/bands/b/beyonce/news_feature_081406/index2.jhtml |work=MTV News |accessdate=2008-01-07}}</ref> They presented the demo to Knowles, who later approved of it (with the approval of Knowles, Riddick was enlisted on the ''B'Day'' songwriting team). "D<U+00E9>j<U+00E0> Vu" also has lyrical contributions from songwriters Delisha Thomas and Keli Nicole Price, and American [[hip hop]] artist and Knowles' long-time boyfriend [[Jay-Z]]. He became involved at a late stage, when Knowles saw him trying to sing along to a recorded version of the track, and asked him to contribute. Jay-Z recorded rap verses for the song and hence appears as a featured guest.<ref>{{Cite news |last=MTV News staff |title=For The Record: Quick News On Beyonce, Jay-Z, Mel Gibson, DMX, Audioslave, Fantasia, Britney Spears & More |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1537577/20060801/knowles_beyonce.jhtml |work=MTV News |date=2006-08-01 |accessdate=2008-01-07}}</ref>

The song opens with Knowles introducing the bass, hi-hat and Roland TR-808 by name. The sounds of the instruments blend as they are mentioned one after the other; the horns are only audible in the pre-chorus and hook sections, and a short section in the second rap. The bass guitar, which is the first instrument to enter, [[slide (guitar technique)|slides]] into the main two-bar [[ostinato]]. Following the repeated bass slides, Knowles introduces the hi-hat and the Roland TR-808. After she mentions Jay-Z, the bass glides up for a [[vibrato]]-rich fill, giving way to the first rap.<ref name="Jisi"/> Backgrounded with a repeating [[groove (music)|groove]], Knowles starts the first verse. The pre-chorus follows, for which the bass changes to a more melodic tone "to play something more singing", in the words of Jon Jon Webb, the bass player on the track.<ref name="Jisi"/><ref name="Lamb">{{Cite web |last=Lamb |first=Bill |title=Beyonce featuring Jay-Z - D<U+00E9>j<U+00E0> vu |url=http://top40.about.com/od/singles/gr/beyoncejayzdj.htm |work=About.com |accessdate=2008-01-07}}</ref> The [[melody]] returns to the main groove during the repeated hook. This pattern repeats and leads to the second rap. The third pre-chorus "comes from Jerkins' idea to have the part changes on top, with Webb's main groove on the bottom".<ref name="Jisi"/> It is followed by the main pre-chorus, then the hook is repeated four times. The vocals stop and the instruments fill in the space. The hi-hat and Roland TR-808 also stop; the song ends with the plucked bass and blasts of horns.

===Critical reception===
"D<U+00E9>j<U+00E0> Vu" fared to mixed reviews among critics. Bill Lamb of [[About.com]] said it lacked "a sense of true exhilaration".<ref name="Lamb"/> The international [[webzine]] [[Popmatters]]<nowiki>'</nowiki> Mike Joseph believed, however, that it was "fantastic to hear Beyonce singing her lungs out over a full-bodied groove featuring live instruments".<ref>{{Cite web |last=Joseph |first=Mike |title= Beyonce: B'Day  |url=http://www.popmatters.com/pm/music/reviews/5216/beyonce-b-day/ |work=Popmatters |date=2006-09-05 |accessdate=2008-01-07}}</ref> Sasha Frere-jones of ''[[The New Yorker]]'' magazine deemed the lyrics a "perplexing view of memory",<ref>{{Cite web |last=Frere-jones |first=Sasha |title=Crazy from Love |url=http://www.newyorker.com/archive/2006/09/25/060925gore_GOAT_recordings |work=The New Yorker |publisher=Cond<U+00E9>Net |date=2006-09-25 |accessdate=2008-03-10}}</ref> while Chris Richards of ''[[The Washington Post]]'', characterized Knowles in "D<U+00E9>j<U+00E0> Vu" as a "love-dazed girlfriend".<ref>{{Cite web |last=Williams |first=Chris |title=Beyonce's 'B'Day' Is Nothing to Celebrate |url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/09/05/AR2006090501475.html |work=The Washington Post |date=2006-09-06 |accessdate=2008-02-10}}</ref> Spence D. of [[IGN]], a multimedia news and reviews website, complimented Jerkins' bass-laden groove, saying that it brought the track to "perfection".<ref>{{Cite web |last=D. |first=Spence |title=Beyonce - B'Day: Sophomore slump narrowly avoided. |url=http://uk.music.ign.com/articles/730/730624p1.html |work=IGN |date=2006-09-05 |accessdate=2008-02-03}}</ref> Caroline Sullivan of the ''[[The Guardian]]'' complimented Knowles and Jay-Z: "Their duet on the magnificent ["]D<U+00E9>j<U+00E0> Vu["] is as feverish as pre-watershed pop gets, but even when Jay-Z is not physically present, he brings out something formidable in Beyonc<U+00E9> that evokes the young, feral [[Tina Turner]]."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2006/sep/01/popandrock.urban1|title=Beyonc<U+00E9>, B'Day|last=Sullivan|first=Caroline|date=2006-09-01|work=The Guardian|accessdate=2008-08-05}}</ref>

Other reviewers have compared "D<U+00E9>j<U+00E0> Vu" to Knowles' 2003 single, "[[Crazy in Love (Beyonc<U+00E9> song)|Crazy in Love]]", the lead single of her [[Dangerously In Love|debut album]]. According to Gail Mitchell of ''Billboard'' magazine, the song is viewed by many as a sequel to "Crazy in Love".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/bbcom/reviews/album_review_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1003086489|title=Album Reviews: B'Day|last=Mitchell|first=Gail|work=Billboard|publisher=Nielsen Business Media, Inc|accessdate=2008-08-05}}</ref> Jason King of the ''[[Vibe (magazine)|Vibe]]'' magazine deemed the song "cloned from the [[DNA]] of the raucous 'Crazy in Love'" while Thomas Inskeep of ''[[Stylus (magazine)|Stylus]]'' magazine referred to it as "'Crazy in Love' lite";<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vibe.com/music/revolutions/2006/09/beyonce_bday_columbia/|title=Beyonc<U+00E9> - B'day (Columbia)|last=King|first=Jason|date=2006-09-15|work=Vibe|accessdate=2008-08-05}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stylusmagazine.com/reviews/beyonc/bday.htm|title=Beyonc<U+00E9>: B'Day|last=Inskeep|first=Thomas|date=2006-09-14|work=Stylus|accessdate=2008-08-05}}</ref> some reviewers, however, were negative to the parallels drawn between the two songs.

Sal Cinquemani of [[Slant Magazine]] commented it is "more thematic and thought provoking than the videos for '[[Baby Boy (song)|Baby Boy]]' and '[[Naughty Girl (Beyonc<U+00E9> Knowles song)|Naughty Girl]]'", Knowles' songs from her debut album, ''[[Dangerously in Love]]''.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Cinquemani |first=Sal |title=Beyonc<U+00E9>: B'Day |url=http://www.slantmagazine.com/music/music_review.asp?ID=950 |work=Slant Magazine |accessdate=2008-01-07}}</ref> Allhiphop.com's Eb Haynes says, "Muller's dramatic depiction of a woman scorned, introduced the world to a vulnerably unhinged, pissed-off Beyonc<U+00E9>."<ref name="Haynes"/> A group of more than 2,000 of Knowles' fans petitioned for a re-shoot of the video, complaining of "a lack of theme, dizzying editing, over-the-top wardrobe choices" and the sexual theme depicted in the video, considering some scenes "'unacceptable interactions' [between Knowles and Jay-Z]". The petition characterized Knowles' dance moves as "erratic, confusing and alarming at times".<ref name="MTVNewsStaff"/> A news article published in HindustanTimes.com reported that a scene where Knowles detaches Jay-Z's belt was suggestive of [[oral sex]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.rollingstone.com/rockdaily/index.php/2006/07/26/scandal-of-the-day-beyonces-too-skanky-for-her-fans|title=Scandal of the Day: Beyonce Too Skanky For Her Fans? |last=Goodman|first=Elizabeth|date=20069-07-26|work=Rolling Stone|accessdate=2008-08-05}}</ref> Natalie Y. Moore of ''[[In These Times]]'' magazine echoed the latter's commentary, writing that the video showcases Knowles "strutting her sexuality", and that in Jay-Z's scenes it "looks as if any minute now she'll give him [[fellatio]]".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.inthesetimes.com/article/2902/beyoncs_bootyful_bay/|title=Beyonce<U+2019>s Bootyful B<U+2019>Day|last=Moore|first=Natalie Y.|date=2006-11-17|work=In These Times|accessdate=2008-08-05}}</ref>
