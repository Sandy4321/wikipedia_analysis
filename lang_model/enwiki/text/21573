'''Matar Ebrahim Ali Matar''' (also spelled '''Mattar Mattar'''; {{lang-ar|<U+0645><U+0637><U+0631> <U+0625><U+0628><U+0631><U+0627><U+0647><U+064A><U+0645> <U+0639><U+0644><U+064A> <U+0645><U+0637><U+0631>}}; born 3 May 1976) is a [[Bahrain]]i politician of the [[Al Wefaq]] party who served as a [[Member of Parliament]] (MP) from October 2010 until his resignation in early 2011. Born in the village of [[Al Daih]] to a large family with diverse political views, Matar completed his [[secondary education]] in Bahrain and moved to [[Kuwait]] to purse higher education. He remained there until 2002 when he returned to Bahrain and joined Al Wefaq political party. Matar was politically active, working within committees in the party and meeting with foreign officials. In 2010, he won with a large margin in the [[Bahraini parliamentary election, 2010|Parliamentary election]], becoming the youngest of all MPs and representing the country's largest constituency.

When the [[Bahraini uprising (2011<U+2013>present)|Bahraini uprising]] started in early 2011, Matar joined the protests and gave several interviews to international media. Following government crackdown, he and other party MPs resigned from Parliament. Due to his activism, Matar was arrested by authorities in May. He was allegedly kept in [[solitary confinement]] and [[Torture during the Bahraini uprising (2011<U+2013>present)|subjected to torture]] while in detention before getting tried before a [[National Safety Court|military court]]. He was released in August and acquitted of charges in February 2012. His arrest, alleged mistreatment and subsequent release triggered several international reactions by international bodies and [[NGO]]s such as the [[Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights]], [[Inter-Parliamentary Union]], [[Amnesty International]] and [[Human Rights Watch]]. Following his release, Matar continued his political activism.

==Early life and career==

Matar was born in [[Al Daih]] village, [[Bahrain]] on 3 May 1976. His father, Ebrahim is [[Polygyny|married]] to three women and has 17 children besides Matar, who is the fifth child out of his mother's seven. The family is diverse in its ideological and political views; some being "[[leftist]]s, [[Islamist]]s, [[Communist]]s, some...[[conservative]] and some [[Liberalism|liberal]]," said a family member. They are active politicians, most of them members of opposition groups [[Al Wefaq]] ([[Shia]]) or [[Wa'ad]] ([[secular]]). As a child, Matar is said to have been shy and intelligent. He studied at [[Muhammad ibn Zakariya al-Razi|Al Razi]] primary school, then at [[Jidhafs]] intermediate school and after that at [[Noaim]] secondary school, where he is said to have been a top student.<ref name="CNN 26.6.2011">{{cite web|title=Bahrain: A Face of Opposition |author=Jenifer Fenton |date=26 June 2011 |accessdate=17 June 2013 |url=http://insidethemiddleeast.blogs.cnn.com/2011/06/26/bahrain-a-face-of-opposition/ |publisher=[[CNN]]}}</ref>

He traveled to [[Kuwait]] to pursue higher education. He earned a [[Master's degree]] in [[Computer Science]] ([[Artificial Intelligence]]) from [[Kuwait University]].

===Background===

[[File:Protesters fests toward Pearl roundabout.jpg|thumb|Protests at [[Pearl Roundabout]] in February 2011]]

Beginning in February 2011, Bahrain saw sustained pro-democracy protests, centered at the [[Pearl Roundabout]] in the capital of [[Manama]], as part of the wider [[Arab Spring]]. Authorities responded with a night raid on 17 February (later referred to by protesters as [[Bahrain Bloody Thursday|Bloody Thursday]]), which left four protesters dead and more than 300 injured.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-12490286 |title=Bahrain protests: Police break up Pearl Square crowd |date=17 February 2011 |publisher=BBC News |accessdate=24 May 2012}}</ref> In March, martial law was declared and [[Saudi]] troops were called in.
