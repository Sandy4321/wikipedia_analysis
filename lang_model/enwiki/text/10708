'''''Doremi Fasol Latido''''' is the third studio album from [[Hawkwind]] released in [[1972]]. It reached #14 on the UK album charts. 

The rhythm section of [[Dave Anderson]] and [[Terry Ollis]] had gone to be replaced by [[Lemmy]] and [[Simon King]], both of whom's style differed notably from their predecessors to give the band an overall change in musical direction. Lemmy was an inept guitarist<ref>[http://www.motorhead.ru/int32l7.htm The Defiant Ones, Request Magazine, March 1997] - Lemmy: "When I was with the Rockin' Vicars in '66, '67, I couldn't play lead. See, I was supposed to be the lead guitarist, so I faked it. I auditioned during a gig <U+2014> most of us did in those days. So I set the fuzz on full and the volume on full and I just hit it very hard and moved my fingers about very fast, and I jumped on the piano and that collapsed, and I smashed me guitar on it, and they thought it was fucking huge. They said, "Hire him" on the spot, and I played with them for a year and a half, and I never played any lead worth a damn, but I was good spectacle, you see, and this is what they were looking for."</ref> who claims never to have played bass until picking it up for Hawkwind<ref>[http://www.motorhead.ru/int2moo.htm We Do Not Bend The Knee, Michael Hannon] - Lemmy: "I learned to play bass onstage with Hawkwind 'cause I never played bass in my life. I knew the guitarist because he took eight tabs of acid and then we never saw him for five years. He vanished, then returned in Widowmaker. So anyway, they lost a guitar player, and I showed up looking for a job; and they wanted a speed freak in the band. He wanted me to join, so he took me with him to this festival. It turns out they didn't need another guitarist, 'cause Dave Brock decided to play lead, so I was fucked, but the bass player never showed up, so he told me to play bass. I go out onstage with this bass around my neck, and it was a Rickenbacker, too. The bass player, like an idiot, left his bass in the truck. So I'm learning. Nik Turner says to make some noises in E. "This one's called You Shouldn't Do That." Then he walks away."</ref>, and to it he brought the unique rhythm/lead guitar style<ref>[http://www.motorhead.ru/int32l7.htm The Defiant Ones, Request Magazine, March 1997] - Lemmy: "I just don't play like a bass player. There are complaints about me from time to time. It's not like having a bass player; it's like having a deep guitarist."</ref> which has brought him considerable recognition, and King's rock drumming was more square beat than the jazzier free flowing Ollis.

The result is one of Hawkwind's heaviest records of their career, with the music faster paced than previously and the vocals are now in full voice, almost shouted a times. The lyrics are primarily concerned with space, echoing the direction [[Barney Bubbles]] and [[Robert Calvert]] were taking the band in, culminating in the [[Space Ritual]] shows from the tour of this album.

===Band quotes===
*"The only thing I remember about Doremi is that we recorded it at the barn, before they modernized it, with mattresses on the walls and things. But it was a good sound. It was just not very well recorded. It was all thin and tinny. It was not as good as In Search of Space, but then I wasn't on that." - Lemmy [http://www.aural-innovations.com/issues/issue14/mothead1.html Aural Innovations Issue 14]

*<U+201C>The <U+2018>Doremi<U+2019> album lacked production. It sounded as if all the bass was turned off, your amp wasn<U+2019>t working properly and your stereo was bunged up all at the same time." - Simon King [http://www.starfarer.net/impounded.html Sounds 12-Oct-1974]
