The '''Battle of the Narrow Seas''' or otherwise known as '''Battle of the Dover Straits''' was a naval engagement that took place on the 3<U+2013>4 October 1602 during the [[Anglo-Spanish War (1585)|Anglo-Spanish War of 1585]] and part of the [[Dutch Revolt]]. An English fleet under Sir [[Robert Mansell]] intercepted and attacked six Spanish [[galley]]s under the command of Federico Spinola; in the Dover Straits and was fought all the way off from the coast of England and finally off the [[Spanish Netherlands]]. The English were soon joined by a Dutch fleet under Jan Van Cant and they completed the destruction.<ref name=autogenerated4>{{DNB Cite|wstitle=Mansell, Robert}}</ref><ref name=autogenerated1>Jaques pg. 714</ref>

==Background==
In 1602 Frederico Spinola, younger brother of [[Ambrogio Spinola, 1st Marquis of the Balbases|Ambrogio Spinola]] had distinguished himself greatly as a soldier in the [[Army of Flanders]] and had succeeded in 1599 going through the English Channel passing the straits of Dover unmolested; this led to a panic called the ''Invisible armada'' as it encouraged suspicions that the attempt might be renewed and on a larger scale.<ref>Wernham p. 269-72</ref> Buoyed by this achievement he had indulged [[Philip III of Spain]], the [[Francisco G<U+00F3>mez de Sandoval, 1st Duke of Lerma|Duke of Lerma]] and [[Mart<U+00ED>n de Padilla y Manrique, 1st Count of Santa Gadea|Mart<U+00ED>n de Padilla]] in a vision of a massive galley-borne invasion of England from Flanders. However the council brought him down to a mere eight galleys, provided at Spinola's expense.<ref name=autogenerated /> He was on his way from [[San Lucar]] to [[Lisbon]] but he was defeated by Sir [[Richard Leveson (died 1605)|Richard Leveson]] [[Battle of Sesimbra Bay|at Sezimbra Bay]] which cost him two galleys.<ref name=autogenerated9 />

After this defeat Spinola took his remaining six galleys back to Lisbon and filled his vessels with pay chests for Flanders. During the sailing to Flanders he took an English ship, which he left at [[A Coru<U+00F1>a]].<ref name="FDuro2">Fern<U+00E1>ndez Duro, Ces<U+00E1>reo: ''El Gran Duque de Osuna y su marina: jornadas contra turcos y venecianos''.

ISBN 84-8472-126-4, [http://books.google.es/books?id=JLTA2t_73vQC&pg=PA205#v=onepage&q&f=false p. 296]</ref> At [[Santander, Spain|Santander]] he took on a further 400 troops to complete the [[Tercio]] complement of 1,600 men. In England word had spread that Spinola was on his way in an attempt to run the English channel again. His heading was for [[Sluis]] with the six galleys, of whose approach was well informed by [[Robert Cecil, 1st Earl of Salisbury|Robert Cecil]] even when they arrived at [[Blavet]] in Brittany at the beginning of October.<ref name=autogenerated3>Bicheno pg 298-99</ref><ref name=autogenerated11 />{{rp|386<U+2013>387}} [[Queen Elizabeth I|Queen Elizabeth]] decided to act, so she appointed Sir Robert Mansell to join with the States fleet before [[Dunkirk]] and Sluis, to see what they could do to impeach them.<ref>{{cite book|last=Lemon|first=Robert|title=Calendar of State Papers: Preserved in the State Paper Department of Her Majesty's Public Record Office .

==Engagement==
Mansell, with three ships (the 30 gun [[English ship Hope (1559)|''Hope'']] along with the 42 gun [[English ship Victory (1569)|''Victory'']] and the ''Answer'') departed and patrolled about [[Dungeness (headland)|Dungeness]]. Mansell's flag captain came up with the strategy on how to tackle Spinola; he predicted that Spinola would try to sail close to the English coast. Acting on this hunch Mansell set one ship a good distance from another using [[flyboat]]s so that a good communication system was erected between themselves and the Dutch fleet off the Flemish coast under Admiral Jan Van Cant.<ref name=autogenerated9 /> On the 3rd Mansell was soon joined by two Dutch flyboats, ''Samson'', and the ''Moon'' to improve communication and now Spinola was effectively sailing into a trap.<ref name=autogenerated11>Coerbett pg&nbsp; 386-95</ref>{{rp|388}}

===Action with the English===
In the moonlight of 3 October just before midnight Mansell was on the lookout for Spinola's galleys and were soon sighted. Mansell ordered an attack and off Dungeness; ''Moon'', ''Samson'' and the ''Answer'' charged at the galleys.<ref name=autogenerated4 /><ref name=autogenerated3 /> Spinola seeing this decided to swing his galleys round to face the South East, the direction of the Flanders coast but in so doing the lead ship ''San Felipe'' (''St. Philip'') ran straight into the ''Victory'' and ''Hope'' forcing the galleys inadvertently further East.<ref name=autogenerated3 />

What happened when the Spanish galleys came under fire of the English ships differs depending on sources: from one side it is asserted that the ''San Felipe'' was nearly battered into submission by ''Victory's'' guns and she was only able to escape when the other galleys came up in support drawing ''Victory's'' and ''Hopes'' fire. On the other hand, it is also claimed that Spinola's galleys succeeded in passing almost unscathed between the English ships by rowing at full strength.<ref name="Villa">Rodr<U+00ED>guez Villa, Antonio: ''Ambrosio Sp<U+00ED>nola, Primer Marqu<U+00E9>s de los balbases''. Madrid: Estab. tip. de Fortanet, 1905, [http://archive.org/stream/ambrosiospnolap00villgoog#page/n50/mode/2up pp.&nbsp;36<U+2013>37]</ref> Mansell decided on creating as much damage as possible; instead of concentrating on one galley, fire was switched from one target to another and as a result be believed that damage was inflicted on most of the galleys they saw in the moonlight. By the time they reached [[Goodwin Sands]] the Spanish galleys started to retreat in desperation for the Flemish coast.<ref name=autogenerated3 /> A gale was now blowing strongly from the West which also hampered Spanish attempts and they were hotly pursued by the English ships and soon the gunfire warnings were signals for the Dutch to engage.<ref name=autogenerated4 />

===Dutch join the attack===
The action continued across the Narrow Seas towards [[Dunkirk]], [[Nieuwpoort, Belgium|Nieuwpoort]], [[Gravelines]] and [[Sluis]].<ref name=autogenerated1 /> The Dutch Admiral Jan van Cant soon cut off the Spanish and the English waited outside of the Flemish road stead in case any tried to escape elsewhere. The States' ship, ''Mackerel'', came in sight and attacked the already damaged ''San Felipe'', pouring in a broadside. Drawing off from this assailant, the galley found herself close to Admiral Cant's ''Half Moon'' which bore straight down upon and struck at her amidships carrying off her [[mainmast]] and her [[Poop deck|poop]].<ref name=autogenerated6 /> Whilst extricating himself with difficulty from the wreck ''Half Moon'' sent a tremendous volley of cannon fire straight into the waist. Another State's galliot bore down to complete the work; ''San Felipe'' sunk quickly carrying with her all the galley slaves, sailors, and soldiers.<ref name=autogenerated9 /><ref name=autogenerated6 />

The ''Lucera'' was the next galley attacked; a Dutch galleot, which drove under full sail managed to ram her. The galley was struck between the mainmast and stern, with a blow which carried away the assailant's own [[bowsprit]], but in return completely demolished the stem of the galley. Admiral Cant came up once more in the ''Half-moon'', and finished ''Lucera'' (''Morning Star'') off by ramming, tearing the galley apart.<ref name=autogenerated6 /> Meanwhile ''Victory'' and two States' Galleots were chasing two galleys; ''San Juan'' and ''Jacinto'' who were already in a sinking state. With no where to escape and the gale blowing against them, the only option was for the respective commanders to run them aground near Nieuwpoort. In the end, both galleys succeeded in reaching the safety of Niewpoort.<ref name="Villa"/> Another galley managed to evade the Dutch and English long enough but it too ended up being wrecked on the French coast near [[Calais]].<ref name=autogenerated11/>{{rp|393}} The galley ''San Luis'', which bore Spinola himself and his thirty six pay chests, attempted to reach Dunkirk, but as the tide was low, she was forced to wait beyond a sandbank. Ten Dutch ships fell upon ''San Luis'', but Spinola succeeded in sailing between the Dutch vessels and reached Dunkirk.<ref name="Villa"/> With this the battle had ended and a Dutch blockade formed to prevent Spinola's escape.<ref name=autogenerated /><ref name=autogenerated11 />{{rp|395}}

==Aftermath==
Casualties were exceptionally heavy for the Spanish; as two galleys sank with all hands, with perhaps over 2,000 were killed wounded or captured. At Calais the wrecked galley was chopped up and used as firewood by the French, the Spanish crew were interned and the galley slaves freed.<ref name=autogenerated3 /> Casualties for the Dutch and English were light with some ships suffering no casualties at all. Two Dutch ships were damaged in the ramming that took place and but the rest of the Dutch ships suffered only minor damage.<ref name=autogenerated6 /> The English ships suffered no damage at all except for a broken mast on ''Samson'' due to the gale.<ref name=autogenerated6 /> The battle clearly showed the difference between galleons and galleys, the transition in warfare, along with the introduction of much cheaper cast iron guns in the 1580s, proved the "death knell" for the war galley as a significant military vessel.<ref name=autogenerated7>Guilmartin p. 254</ref><ref name=autogenerated11/>{{rp|395}}
 
Mansell was rewarded for his part in the victory and was named [[Vice-Admiral]] of the Narrow Seas in commemoration of the name of the battle.<ref name=autogenerated4 /> As for Spinola, he managed to save half of the galleys, as the two which had reached Nieuwpoort were soon able to join ''San Luis'' in Dunkirk.<ref name="Villa"/><ref name="FDuro">[[Ces<U+00E1>reo Fern<U+00E1>ndez Duro|Fern<U+00E1>ndez Duro, Ces<U+00E1>reo]]: ''Armada espa<U+00F1>ola desde la uni<U+00F3>n de los reinos de Castilla y de Arag<U+00F3>n''. Vol. III. Instituto de Historia y Cultura Naval, [http://www.armada.mde.es/html/historiaarmada/tomo3/tomo_03_05.pdf p. 222]</ref> From there, the three ships sailed unmolested to [[Sluis]], where Spinola with his five galleys still possessed a threat to the English and Dutch shipping.<ref name="FDuro2"/><ref name="Villa"/> Both the English and the Dutch were gradually able to gain supremacy in the seas not just in and around the English Channel but in all the European waters.<ref name=autogenerated /> As a result Spinola would be defeated again and mortally wounded at the [[Battle of Sluis (1603)|Battle of Sluys]] by the blockading Dutch forces in an attempt to escape.<ref name=autogenerated9 /><ref name=autogenerated11/>{{rp|395}} Spinola's death and the subsequent surrender of Sluis to the Dutch in 1604 ended his and Philip III's dreams, and English fears, of a galley-borne invasion of England from Flanders.<ref name=autogenerated />
