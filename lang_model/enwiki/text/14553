'''Meade Layne''' was an early researcher in the pseudoscience of ufology  best known for proposing an early version of the [[interdimensional hypothesis]] to explain flying saucer sightings. 

=="Etheria"==
He speculated that rather than representing advanced military or extraterrestrial technology that flying saucer pilots were beings from a parallel dimension whose craft were usually invisible but could be seen when their atomic motion became slow enough. He called the alleged dimension-hopping vessels "ether ships" and speculated that they originated in a parallel dimension called Etheria. Layne believed that sometime Etherians could become stranded on the terrestrial plane when their ether ships malfunctioned. Further, he thought that various governments were aware of these [[List of alleged UFO crashes|incidents]] and had investigated them.

=="Etherians" in mythology==
Layne speculated that Etherians and their ether ships inspired much of earth's mythology and religion. He believed, however, that the Etherians were truly mortal beings despite having a high level of technological and spiritual advancement. Layne felt that their motives in coming to the terrestrial plane of existence was to reveal some of their allegedly great accumulated wisdom to humanity. Some individuals with sufficiently developed psychic abilities were alleged by Layne to have the ability to contact the Etherians and communicate with them directly.
