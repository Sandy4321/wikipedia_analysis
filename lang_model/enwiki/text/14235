'''Larry Dell Alexander''' (born May 30, 1953) is an [[United States|American]] artist, [[Christian]] author and teacher from [[Dermott, Arkansas]] in [[Chicot County]]. Alexander is best known for his creations of colorful and black & white "[[pen and ink]]" drawings in his "[[crosshatching]]" technique, and, his personal rendition of a "Clinton Family Portrait" oil painting which he gave to [[U.S. President]] [[Bill Clinton]] in 1995. He has also written several devotional [[Bible studies]] commentaries on several [[New Testament]] books of the [[Christian Bible]].<ref>[http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=ST&p_theme=st&p_action=search&p_maxdocs=200&s_dispstring=irving%20artist%20gives%20his%20presidential%20portrait%20to%20clintons%20AND%20date(all)&p_field_advanced-0=&p_text_advanced-0=(irving%20artist%20gives%20his%20presidential%20portrait%20to%20clintons)&xcal_numdocs=20&p_perpage=10&p_sort=YMD_date:D&xcal_useweights=no Fort Worth Star-Telegram - Archives - "Irving artist gives his presidential portrait to Clintons" - Mon.

==Early life and career==
[[File:The Artwork of Larry D. Alexander 005.jpg|thumb|"Send in the Clown", a "Pen & Ink" "Crosshatching drawing" by Alexander]]
Born in the small rural town of [[Dermott, Arkansas]] to Robert and Janie Alexander, Larry is the fourth of ten children and the second of the union of his parents.  Alexander began drawing at about the age of four. He never received any formal art training during any level of his schooling while growing up, as none was available in his small rural hometown. After graduating from [[Dermott]] [[High School]] in May 1971, Alexander moved to [[Pine Bluff, Arkansas]], where he studied Architectural Residential Design at Pines Vocational Technical School, now [[Southeast Arkansas College]]. In later years he also attended [[Richland College]] in [[Dallas, Texas]] were he studied [[AutoCAD]]. 

Today, six pieces of his work from his popular "Dermott Series", a series of paintings he painted about his childhood home of Dermott, are now a part of the permanent collection at [[the Arts and Science Center for Southeast Arkansas]] in [[Pine Bluff, Arkansas]]. Alexander's work is mostly influenced by his experiences in life, such as growing up in the rural south during the 1950s and 1960s, as well as his life in [[Detroit, Michigan]] during the 1970s and 1980s. 

Alexander moved to [[Detroit, Michigan]] after two years of school in [[Pine Bluff]] to seek employment in his chosen field. However, he was unsuccessful in the short run, and instead, he ended up finding work in a [[Chrysler]] auto assembly plant and became fascinated with the innerworkings of cars. This led him to become a certified mechanic, a craft he worked at for the next seventeen years. He ultimately met and married his wife, Patricia while living in Detroit, and they moved their family to [[Irving, Texas]] where he opened his own auto repair shop and operated it until 1991. 

Encouraged by Patricia, he began using his art talent for the first time in fifteen years. His career as a professional artist can be traced back to this point as he developed his "[[pen and ink]]" style that he calls "[[crosshatching]]", and used it to create several lines of greeting cards under his, now defunct, "Alexander Greeting Cards Company" name.<ref>[http://cocatalog.loc.gov/cgi-bin/Pwebrecon.cgi?Search_Arg=Alexander%2C+Larry+D.&Search_Code=NALL&PID=7hgPTsH43_NGlNt8hd8twcRb17De&SEQ=20100318205238&CNT=25&HIST=1 - Library of Congress - Alexander, Larry Dell - 1953]</ref><ref>[http://www.faqs.org/copyright/alexander-greeting-card-company-presents-the-save-the/ - Alexander Greeting Cards - Larry Dell Alexander]</ref> Between 1991 and 1994 he created over 80 pieces of "pen and ink" [[fine art]],<ref name="cocatalog.loc.gov">[http://cocatalog.loc.gov/cgi-bin/Pwebrecon.cgi?Search_Arg=Alexander%2C+Larry+D.&Search_Code=NALL&PID=7hgPTsH43_NGlNt8hd8twcRb17De&SEQ=20100318205238&CNT=25&HIST=1 - Library of Congress - Alexander, Larry D. - 1953]</ref> including "Renetta", "Girlfriends", "Cowboy Fiddler", "Young Kennedys", and "Roundup". He also used many of his drawings on his "FinearTshirt" T-Shirt line of the mid-nineties.<ref>[http://thelarrydalexander.com/LARRYDALEXANDER///mnt/w0002/d03/s37/b02abff0/www/thelarrydalexander.com//LARRYDALEXANDER//wp-content/uploads/2010/02/Larry%20D.%20Alexander%20News%20025.jpg Dallas Morning News - "Artist donates design to help homeless" - Artime Magazine/Irving News section _ Oct. 1994 - page 2]</ref> 

Alexander is also a [[realist painter]] who works in a variety of other mediums including [[oil paint|oils]], [[acrylic paint|acrylics]], and [[watercolors]]. He is a self-taught artist who chooses mostly to do exhibits in venues that provide mainstream exposure to a large variety of people such as festivals, schools, malls, libraries, banks, art institutions, and even [[United States Postal Service|U.S. Post Office]] branches on occasion.<ref>[http://thelarrydalexander.com/LARRYDALEXANDER///mnt/w0002/d03/s37/b02abff0/www/thelarrydalexander.com//LARRYDALEXANDER//wp-content/uploads/2010/03/Larry%20D.%20Alexander-In%20the%20News.jpg "Texas artist to show new prints at festival" - Pine Bluff Commercial - Friday May 20, 2005 - page 1D]</ref><ref>[http://thelarrydalexander.com/LARRYDALEXANDER///mnt/w0002/d03/s37/b02abff0/www/thelarrydalexander.com//LARRYDALEXANDER//wp-content/uploads/2010/02/Larry%20D.%20Alexander%20News%20003.jpg Pine Bluff Commercial  - "Works by Dermott native accepted by Arts Center" - Thur.

===The Dermott Series===
In early 1996 Alexander finished and released his popular "Dermott Series", a 20 piece collection of oil and acrylic paintings that offered a nostalgic look back at his childhood of growing up in rural southeast [[Arkansas]]. The paintings feature images of people, buildings, and sites of [[Dermott, Arkansas]], such as a cotton gin, his childhood house, where he went to school, and other images. Alexander said at the time that, "I did the Dermott Series for many personal reasons, and I'm overwhelmed by the response this collection is creating here in Texas". The series includes, "Birthplace", "Where I grew up", "Picking Cotton", "Cotton Gin", "Hot Grits", "In the kitchen with mama", and the old [[Chicot County]] High School, among others.<ref>[http://thelarrydalexander.com/LARRYDALEXANDER///mnt/w0002/d03/s37/b02abff0/www/thelarrydalexander.com//LARRYDALEXANDER//wp-content/uploads/2010/02/Larry%20D.%20Alexander%20News%20006.jpg - "Alexander paints series of Dermott" - Chicot County Spectator - May 1, 1996 - pg.7]</ref>

===The Detroit Series===
In 1999 Alexander unveiled his "Detroit Series", a series of [[oil]] and [[acrylic paint|acrylic]] paintings of various sites in [[Detroit, Michigan]] at the American Black Artist Institute on [[West Grand Boulevard]] in [[Detroit]]. The nine piece series includes paintings on [[Belle Isle Park]], the [[Detroit skyline]], the [[Detroit River]], [[Hitsville USA]] (the original home for [[Motown Records]]), [[Greektown Historic District]], the old [[Tiger Stadium (Detroit)]], the old [[J.L. Hudson]] building, former mayor [[Coleman A. Young]], and many more.<ref>[http://thelarrydalexander.com/LARRYDALEXANDER///mnt/w0002/d03/s37/b02abff0/www/thelarrydalexander.com//LARRYDALEXANDER//wp-content/uploads/2010/02/Larry%20D.%20Alexander%20News%20012.jpg - "Alexander unveils his "Detroit Series"]</ref>

===The Delta Series===
In May 1998 Alexander unveiled his "Delta Series, which was painted entirely with acrylics, during "[[the Arkansas Schools Tours]]". The tour was expanded that year to include stops in [[Greenville, Mississippi]] and [[Memphis, Tennessee]]. This series included paintings of the [[Mississippi Alluvial Plain]] region from [[Monroe, Louisiana]] to Memphis. It includes a painting of [[Graceland]], [[Elvis Presley]]'s former home, the landmark Greenville Courthouse in Greenville, a perspective of [[Beale Street]] in Memphis, and his classic rendition of a "Cotton Farm" among others.<ref>[http://thelarrydalexander.com/LARRYDALEXANDER///mnt/w0002/d03/s37/b02abff0/www/thelarrydalexander.com//LARRYDALEXANDER//wp-content/uploads/2010/03/Larry%20D.%20Alexander%20News%20014.jpg - Pine Bluff Commercial - "Artist announces plan for "Arkansas Tour" - May, 1998]</ref> Another piece from the Delta Series, "Aunt Eira Mae" was donated to the permanent collection of [[The African American Museum (Dallas, Texas)]] in 2004.

===The Series of P.A.T.R.I.C.E===
Alexander has also donated work to art departments of schools and colleges. In October 1996 at halftime at the inaugural football game, billed as the "[[Mobil]] Gridiron Classic", at [[Texas Stadium]] in [[Irving, Texas]], Alexander presented a piece from one of his series, "The series of P.A.T.R.I.C.E", to the president, and the chancellor, of the participating colleges, respectively, [[Texas Southern University]] and the [[University of Arkansas at Pine Bluff]].<ref>[http://thelarrydalexander.com/LARRYDALEXANDER///mnt/w0002/d03/s37/b02abff0/www/thelarrydalexander.com//LARRYDALEXANDER//wp-content/uploads/2010/02/Larry%20D.%20Alexander%20News%20019.jpg - Pine Bluff Commercial - "Around and about" - Sun. October 27, 1996]</ref>

===The Sixties Series===
Alexander's most popular [[Pen and Ink]] art series, "The Sixties Series" has been exhibited in schools, libraries, and art institutions in several places since it was completed in 1993. It consists of elaborate drawings of well known figures and events of the 1960s, such as the civil rights [[Selma to Montgomery marches]] of 1965, and portraits of [[Martin Luther King Jr.]], [[Lyndon Johnson]], [[Malcolm X]], [[Medgar Evers]], and [[Rosa Parks]]. This series also covers the [[Vietnam War]]. 

The theme pieces in the collection are a piece called "Composite Sixties", and one called "Composite Protests", which make up a composite of people, places and events that were prominent in the 1960s. For example, they show images of [[John F. Kennedy]], [[Lyndon Johnson]], and [[Richard M. Nixon]], the [[United States]] presidents who served during the sixties, also [[J. Edgar Hoover]], [[Jackie Kennedy]], [[Ted Kennedy]], [[Robert F. Kennedy]], an image of U.S. astronauts landing on the moon in 1969, and many of the [[United States|American]] protests that took place during this turbulent decade, to name a few.<ref>[http://thelarrydalexander.com/LARRYDALEXANDER///mnt/w0002/d03/s37/b02abff0/www/thelarrydalexander.com//LARRYDALEXANDER//wp-content/uploads/2010/03/Larry%20D.%20Alexander-In%20the%20News%20001.jpg - Pine Bluff Commercial - "Crawfish Festival brings Dermott native back home" - Fri.

==African-American history book==
In 2001, Alexander finished his first book called ''African-American History at a Glance'', which also included several [[pen and ink]] drawings of [[African-Americans]] who have contributed substantially to the [[United States|American]] success story. "There is a lack of input regarding [[African-Americans]] in the [[American history]] curriculum of schools all over [[United States|America]]" Mr. Alexander says. "There are a lot of schools that offer it as a choice to students, but I think it should be a part of regular [[American history]]". 

Alexander's book was used to help create a supplemental text, that was later put together by the [[Irving Independent School District]] to help improve the [[American history]] curriculum in the high schools of [[Irving, Texas]] in 2002. His book deliberately ignores the contributions of [[African-Americans]] in the areas of sports and entertainment, as he feels they are already too well known and over-emphasized in society. Alexander says in his book that, "By no means is this an attempt to downplay the prowess of these particular individuals, or to discourage other individuals who aspire to excel in those areas. This publication is intent on bringing to the forefront, some of the [[African-American]] contributions that have historically been largely ignored".<ref>[http://thelarrydalexander.com/LARRYDALEXANDER///mnt/w0002/d03/s37/b02abff0/www/thelarrydalexander.com//LARRYDALEXANDER//wp-content/uploads/2010/02/Larry%20D.%20Alexander%20News%20020.jpg Dallas Morning News - "Broadening Minds" - Thur.

==Christian books==
In 2006, Alexander wrote his second book entitled ''Sunday school lessons from the book of [[the Acts of the Apostles]]'', which deals with his calling by God to teach the [[Holy Bible]]. ''Sunday school lessons from the book of the Acts of the Apostles'' was the first of a trilogy that he self-published over a one year period. It was followed in late 2006 by the second book of the trilogy, called ''Sunday school lessons from the Gospel according to [[John Mark]]''. The final book in the trilogy, ''Sunday school lessons from the [[Apostle Paul]]'s [[letter to the Romans]]'' was released in mid-2007.<ref name="cocatalog.loc.gov"/> His other books include ''Home Bible study commentaries from [[the Gospel of John]]'' in 2008, and ''Home and Church Bible study commentaries from the [[Book of Hebrews]]'' in 2009. Alexander also writes a weekly on-line Sunday school lesson commentary based on the International Sunday School Lessons curriculum.<ref>[http://www.larrydalexander.blogspot.com Larry D.

==Arkansas school tours==
Alexander and his cousin Lawrence <U+201C>Larry<U+201D> Crockett, both natives of [[Dermott, Arkansas]] put together the first "Arkansas schools tour" in 1996, and in May of that year, visited ten schools in seven cities in four days. Crockett and his son, B.J., both traveled with Alexander on the initial tour, while they were on a one-week break from the tour of the [[Rodgers and Hammerstein]] [[Broadway musical]] <U+201C>[[Carousel]]<U+201D>, which B.J. had a role in at the time. After the first year however, the tour was continued on by Alexander alone through 2007. Alexander says he wanted to give back to his home state of Arkansas and be a blessing to the children who live there, and, because of the success of the first tour in 1996, Alexander decided to continue doing it once annually for the next ten years. Its major objective was to instill hope and encouragement in the children of Arkansas, and to aid them in making good choices during the developing stages of life.<ref>[http://thelarrydalexander.com/LARRYDALEXANDER///mnt/w0002/d03/s37/b02abff0/www/thelarrydalexander.com//LARRYDALEXANDER//wp-content/uploads/2010/02/Larry%20D.%20Alexander%20News%20027.jpg Pine Bluff Commercial - "Artist and Actor to visit area this week" - Sunday May 12, 1996 - page 2C]</ref> These annual visits to [[high schools]], [[middle schools]], and [[elementary schools]], were also conducted to instruct and encourage children in pursuing their goals and careers in the [[visual arts]], as well as other areas, and to stay away from [[illegal drugs]]. It was during the second tour in 1997 that Alexander incorporated his anti-drug slogan <U+201C>Eradicate Drug Use Common Among Teens Everywhere<U+201D> (EDUCATE). Alexander usually ended his tour with a two-day art exhibit and print signing at the [[Dermott, Arkansas]] [[Crawfish]] Festival.<ref>[http://thelarrydalexander.com/LARRYDALEXANDER///mnt/w0002/d03/s37/b02abff0/www/thelarrydalexander.com//LARRYDALEXANDER//wp-content/uploads/2010/02/Larry%20D.%20Alexander%20News%20028.jpg The McGehee Times/Dermott News - "Alexander to present artwork at Crawfish Festival" - Wed.

==Religion==
{{Rquote|right|'''It seems as if God has placed a hunger and thirst inside of each of us, innately from birth, and the only way to satisfy that hunger or thirst is by seeking and ultimately finding Him. It is for the purpose of God that man was ever created in the first place. And just as no man has ever created anything that weren't for his own purpose or benefit, so it is with God. Man was created to serve God. And until we can grasp and understand that, we'll just continue to meander around, looking for physical answers, to problems, that have always been, spiritual'''|Larry D. Alexander}}
Alexander is a devout [[Christian]] who teaches [[Sunday school]] and has also served as a [[Church deacon]]. He has taught [[Sunday school]] for several years and he also teaches through his books, online weekly [[Sunday school]] lesson commentaries, which are based on the international Sunday school lesson system, and, his national e-mail system. 

He also has created a large body of artwork in [[Christian]] and biblical themes over the years, such as his paintings, "The Twenty-third Psalm Series", which are a visual depiction of the verses of [[Psalm 23]] in the [[Holy Bible]], "Memories of St. Paul", which is a depiction of his childhood church in [[Dermott, Arkansas]], "Bible Stories", "The Fall of Man", a depiction of [[Adam]] and [[Eve]] after being evicted from the [[Garden of Eden]], "Sunday Sermon", and many, many more.
