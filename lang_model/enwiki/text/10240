[[Image:Nepriklausomybes_aktas.gif|thumb|right|250px|Facsimile of the Act of February 16]]
The '''Act of Independence of Lithuania''' ({{lang-lt|Lietuvos Nepriklausomyb<U+0117>s Aktas}}) or '''Act of February 16''' was signed by the [[Council of Lithuania]] on [[February 16]] [[1918]], proclaiming the restoration of an independent State of [[Lithuania]], governed by [[democracy|democratic]] principles, with [[Vilnius]] as its capital. The Act was signed by all twenty representatives, chaired by [[Jonas Basanavi<U+010D>ius]]. The Act of February 16 was the end result of a series of resolutions on the issue, including one issued by the [[Vilnius Conference]] and the Act of January 8. The path to the Act was long and complex because the [[German Empire]] exerted pressure on the Council to form an alliance. The Council had to carefully maneuver between the Germans, whose troops were present in Lithuania, and the demands of the Lithuanian people.

The immediate effects of the announcement of Lithuania's independence re-establishment were limited. Publication of the Act was prohibited by the German authorities, and the text was distributed and printed illegally. The work of the Council was hindered and Germans remained in control over Lithuania.<ref name=el/> The situation changed only when Germany lost [[World War I]] in the fall of 1918. In November 1918, the first Cabinet of Lithuania was formed and the Council of Lithuania gained control over the territory of Lithuania.<ref>{{cite book| first=Vytas Stanley |last=Vardys |coauthors=Judith B. Sedaitis |title=Lithuania: The Rebel Nation |publisher=WestviewPress |year=1997 |series=Westview Series on the Post-Soviet Republics |isbn=0-8133-1839-4 |pages=22-23}}</ref> Independent Lithuania, although it would soon be battling the [[Lithuanian Wars of Independence|Wars of Independence]], became a reality.

While the Act's original document has been lost, its legacy continues. The [[laconic phrase|laconic]] Act is the legal basis for the existence of modern Lithuania, both during the [[interwar period]] and since 1990.<ref name=maks/> The Act formulated the basic constitutional principles that were and still are followed by all [[Constitution of Lithuania|Constitutions of Lithuania]]. The Act itself was a key element in the foundation of Lithuania's [[Act of the Re-Establishment of the State of Lithuania|re-establishment of independence in 1990]].<ref name=VAR/> Lithuania, breaking away from the [[Soviet Union]], stressed that it was simply re-establishing the independent state that existed between the world wars and that the Act never lost its legal power.<ref name=LRS/>

[[Image:Signatarai.Signatories of Lithuania.jpg|thumb|left|250px|The original 20 members of the Council of Lithuania after signing the Act of [[February 16]] [[1918]]]]
After the last [[partitions of Poland|Partition of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]] in 1795, Lithuania was annexed by the [[Russian Empire]].<ref>{{en icon}} {{cite book |last= Grenoble |first= Lenore |title= Language Policy in the Soviet Union|date=2003-07-31|publisher= Kluwer Academic Publishers |pages=104 |isbn= 1402012985}}</ref> During the [[19th century]], both the Lithuanians and the Poles attempted to restore their independence. They rebelled during the [[November Uprising]] in 1830 and the [[January Uprising]] in 1863, but the first realistic opportunity came when both Russia and Germany were weakened during [[World War I]].

In 1915, Germany occupied Lithuania as its troops marched towards Russia. After the [[Russian Revolution of 1917|Russian Revolution]] in 1917, Germany conceived the geopolitical strategy of [[Mitteleuropa]] <U+2013> a regional network of [[puppet state]]s that would serve as a buffer zone <U+2013> and agreed to allow the [[Vilnius Conference]], hoping that it would proclaim that the Lithuanian nation wanted to detach itself from Russia and establish a closer relationship with Germany.<ref name=el>{{en icon}} {{cite encyclopedia | editor = Simas Su<U+017E>ied<U+0117>lis | encyclopedia = [[Encyclopedia Lituanica]] | title = Council of Lithuania | year = 1970-1978 | publisher = Juozas Kapo<U+010D>ius | volume = I | location = Boston, Massachusetts | id = {{LCC|74-114275}} | pages = 581-585}}</ref> However, this strategy backfired; the conference, held between September 18 and 22, 1917, adopted a resolution that an independent Lithuania should be established and that a closer relationship with Germany would be conditional on Germany's formal recognition of the new state.<ref name=Lina> {{lt icon}} {{cite book |last= Kulikauskien<U+0117> |first= Lina |title= Lietuvos istorijos vadov<U+0117>lis/1917 met<U+0173> Lietuvos Taryba

==Path to the Act of February 16==
===Act of December 11===
The Act of December 11 was the second stage in the progression towards the final Act of Independence. The first draft, demanded by chancellor [[Georg von Hertling]], was prepared by the German Ministry of Foreign Affairs on [[December 1]].<ref name=eidintas/> Further changes were jointly prepared by the German chancellery and by a delegation of the Council of Lithuania. The delegation's members were [[Antanas Smetona]], [[Steponas Kairys]], [[Vladas Mironas]], [[Jurgis <U+0160>aulys]], [[Petras Klimas]] and [[Aleksandras Stulginskis]].<ref name=Raimundas> {{lt icon}} {{cite journal|url=http://www.ceeol.com/aspx/getdocument.aspx?logid=5&id=8e57bf2c-f20c-494d-8b04-9bfedd6a3fbd |title=Vasario 16-osios aktas: teksto formavimo <U+0161>altiniai ir autoryst<U+0117>s problema| accessdate=2007-01-27|first=Raimundas |last=Klimavi<U+010D>ius|journal=History. A Collection of Lithuanian Universities' Research Papers |publisher=Vilnius Pedagogical University |issue=59-60 |pages=57-66 | date=2004-02-17}}</ref> After discussion amongst the parties, a compromise was reached on the document's text. The German representative, [[Kurt fon Lersner]], insisted that not one letter be changed in the agreed-upon text and that all the Council members sign the document.<ref name=Raimundas/>

After the delegation returned to Vilnius, a session of the Council was held on [[December 11]] in order to discuss the Act. It was adopted without changes. Fifteen voted in favor of the Act, three voted against it, one member abstained, and one did not participate.<ref name=Raimundas/> It is not entirely clear whether every member of the Council signed this document.<ref name=Raimundas/> The Act was written in [[German language|German]] and apparently no official Lithuanian translation was prepared. Therefore different sources provide slightly different translations.<ref name=Raimundas/> The Act of December 11 pronounced Lithuania's independence, but also asked German government for protection (clause 2) and called for "a firm and permanent alliance" with Germany.<ref name=Lina/> Since the Act specified that the alliance was to be formed based on conventions concerning military affairs, transportation, customs, and currency, many Lithuanians argued that the Council had overstepped its authority: the September resolution adopted by the Vilnius Conference clearly demanded that a constituent assembly decide these crucial matters of state.<ref name=eidintas/>

===Act of January 8===
[[Image:Jonas Basanavicius (1851-1927).jpg|thumb|200px|Jonas Basanavi<U+010D>ius, the chairman of the Council when the Act of February 16 was signed]]
When peace talks started between Germany and Russia in 1918, German authorities asked the [[Lithuanians|Lithuanian]] representatives to prepare two notifications of independence - one for Russia, in which Lithuania's ties with Russia would be denounced and nothing would be mentioned about an alliance with Germany, and a version to be released in Germany that would essentially repeat the Act of December 11.<ref name=Raimundas/> The Council decided to amend the first part of the Act of December 11. [[Petras Klimas]] included a sentence calling for the Constituent Assembly.<ref name=Skirius> {{lt icon}} {{cite book |last=Skirius|first=Juozas |url=http://mkp.emokykla.lt/gimtoji/?id=1012 |accessdate=2007-01-27 |title=Lietuvos istorijos vadov<U+0117>lis/Lietuvos nepriklausomyb<U+0117>s akto paskelbimas| year=2003| location=Vilnius |publisher=Elektronin<U+0117>s leidybos namai |isbn=9986921694}}</ref> Another important development was the statement that democratic principles would be the basis of the new state's governance,<ref name=Raimundas/> something that was declared by the Vilnius Conference, but omitted in the Act of December 11.<ref name=MG>{{lt icon}} {{cite journal| title=Jonas Vilei<U+0161>is ir Vasario 16-osios Aktas |url=http://ausis.gf.vu.lt/mg/nr/2001/12/12v.html |accessdate=2007-02-10 |first=Dobilas |last=Kirvelis| journal=Mokslas ir gyvenimas | year=2001 |volume=12 |issue=528}}</ref> The second part, mentioning the "firm and permanent alliance with Germany", was completely omitted.<ref name=Skirius/> Its final version was approved on [[January 8]] [[1918]], the day that [[President of the United States|U.S. President]] [[Woodrow Wilson]] announced his [[Fourteen Points]]. In its essence, the Act of January 8 did not differ from the Act of February 16.<ref name=MG/>

However, [[Ober Ost]], the German military administration, rejected the changes. On [[January 26]], in compliance with the earlier request, the two versions of the notification were approved, but they did not include the changes of [[January 8]].<ref name=Skirius/> The texts were prepared based on the Act of December 11. These concessions to the Germans created tensions among the Council members.<ref name=gerutis/> Four members <U+2013> [[Mykolas Bir<U+017E>i<U+0161>ka]], [[Steponas Kairys]], [[Stanislovas Narutavi<U+010D>ius]] and [[Jonas Vilei<U+0161>is]] <U+2013> resigned from the Council in protest.<ref name=eidintas/> The chairman of the Council, [[Antanas Smetona]], who supported the Act of December 11, stepped down.<ref name=MG/> Jonas Basanavi<U+010D>ius, who would later be called the patriarch of independence, was elected as the chairman.<ref>{{lt icon}} {{cite book |last=Nezabitauskas |first=Adolfas |title=Jonas Basanavi<U+010D>ius| year=1990| pages=6| publisher=Vaga |location=Vilnius| isbn=5-415-00640-0}}</ref>

===Act of February 16===
Germany failed to recognize Lithuania as an independent state, and the Lithuanian delegation was not invited to the [[Treaty of Brest-Litovsk|Brest-Litovsk negotiations]] that started on [[December 22]] [[1917]] between the [[Central Powers]] and [[Russia]] in order to settle territorial claims.<ref name=gerutis/>  During the first and final official joint session between the Council and the German authorities, it was made it clear that the Council would serve only as an advisory board.<ref name=Skirius/> This situation gave additional backing to those Council members who were seeking independence without any ties to other countries. The prime concern at this point was to invite back those members who had left the Council. Negotiations were undertaken that led to the reformulation of previous versions of the Act.

The four withdrawn members demanded that the Council return to the Act of January 8 and omit the mention of any alliance with Germany.<ref name=Raimundas/> After heated debates that lasted for several weeks, on [[February 15]], at 10 o'clock AM, the new revision of the Act was ready. It included, with minor stylistic changes, wording of the Act of January 8 and promulgation and notification, drafted on [[February 1]]. [[Promulgation]] and notification do not carry legal weight and do not change the meaning of a legal document.<ref name=Raimundas/> The Council, including the withdrawn members, was invited to return the next day for its finalization. On the next day, [[February 16]] [[1918]], at 12:30 PM, all twenty Council members met in the room of Lithuanian Committee for Support of the War Victims, at 30 [[Did<U+017E>ioji Street]] in Vilnius.<ref name=Skirius/> The building is since known as [[House of the Signatories]] ({{lang-lt|signatar<U+0173> namai}}) and houses a museum. The Council first voted to approve the first part, the first two paragraphs up to the word ''drauge'', of the Act. This section was approved unanimously.<ref name=maks>{{lt icon}} {{cite book| first=Mindaugas |last=Maksimaitis |title=Lietuvos valstyb<U+0117>s konstitucij<U+0173> istorija (XX a. pirmoji pus<U+0117>) |publisher=Justitia |location=Vilnius |year=2005 |isbn=9955-616-09-1 |pages=36-44}}</ref> The second part, however, did not receive support from the four withdrawn members because they were not satisfied with the word "''finally''" in describing the duties of the Constituent Assembly (in "''...the foundation of the Lithuanian State and its relations with other countries will be finally determined by the Constituent Assembly...''").<ref name=maks/> They were afraid that this word would give a pretext for the Council to usurp the powers of the Constituent Assembly, while the majority argued that the word simply expressed the non-negotiable and non-appealable nature of the future Assembly's decisions.<ref name=Raimundas/> Therefore the Act was unanimously approved ''[[:wiktionary:en bloc|en bloc]]'' but did not have full-fledged support from all twenty men.<ref name=maks/>

==Aftermath==
===Lithuania===
[[Image:Lietuvos aidas independence.jpg|thumb|220px|The front page of ''Lietuvos aidas'' with the text of the Act. The bulk of the issue was confiscated by German authorities.]]

Soon after the signing, the Act was taken to Germany and handed to parties in the [[Reichstag]]. On [[February 18]], the text was reprinted in German newspapers, including ''Das Neue Litauen'', ''Vossische Zeitung'', ''Taegliche Rundschau'', and ''Kreuzzeitung''.<ref name=el/> In Lithuania a text of the proclamation was prepared for printing in newspapers, particularly in ''[[Lietuvos aidas]]'', the Council's newspaper established by Antanas Smetona, but the German authorities prohibited this publication.<ref>{{en icon}} {{cite web|url=http://www.aidas.lt/about.htm |title=About Us|accessdate=2007-01-30|publisher=Lietuvos aidas|year=2005}}</ref> Although the majority of the copies of the issue were confiscated, the newspaper's editor, [[Petras Klimas]], managed to hide about 60 of them.<ref name=Skirius/> This censorship meant that the distribution and dissemination of the Act was illegal in Lithuania.

On [[March 3]] [[1918]], Germany and the now-[[Bolshevik]] Russia signed the [[Treaty of Brest-Litovsk]]. It declared that the [[Baltic states|Baltic nations]] were in the German interest zone and that Russia renounced any claims to them. On [[March 23]], Germany recognized independent Lithuania on the basis of the December 11 declaration.<ref name=el/> However, in substance, nothing had changed either in Lithuania or in the Council's status: any efforts to establish an administration were hindered.<ref name=gerutis> {{en icon}} {{cite book |last=Gerutis |first=Albertas |editor= Ed. Albertas Gerutis |others= translated by Algirdas Budreckis|title= Lithuania: 700 Years |year=1984 |edition=6th |publisher= Manyland Books|location= New York|id={{LCC|75-80057}}. ISBN 0-87141-028-1 |pages=151-162 |chapter=Independent Lithuania}}</ref> This situation changed when the [[German Revolution]] started and Germany lost the war in the fall of 1918 <U+2013> it was no longer in a position to dictate terms. The Council of Lithuania adopted the first provisional constitution on [[November 2]]. The functions of government were entrusted to a three-member presidium, and [[Augustinas Voldemaras]] was invited to form the first Cabinet of Ministers of Lithuania.<ref name=eidintas> {{en icon}} {{cite book |last=Eidintas |first=Alfonsas |coauthors=Vytautas <U+017D>alys, Alfred Erich Senn |editor=Ed.

The Council immediately began to organize an army, police, municipalities, and other institutions. The proclaimed independence was established.

===The Act===
Two copies of the Act were signed: the original and a duplicate. The original was given to Jonas Basanavi<U+010D>ius to safeguard and protect. The original was never published or used in any public matters; its existence was first mentioned in the press in 1933.<ref name=orig>{{lt icon}} {{cite web|url=http://www.lnm.lt/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=64&Itemid=100 |title=1918 m. vasario 16 d.

The duplicate was used in day-to-day business, and was stored in the president's archives until [[June 15]] [[1940]], the day when Lithuania lost its independence and was occupied by the [[Soviet Union|Soviets]].<ref name=orig/> After that date the document disappeared. Neither the original or the duplicate has been located; historians and adventurers continue to hunt for it. In 2006, a team of engineers searched the walls of the former house of the signatory Petras Vilei<U+0161>is.<ref>{{lt icon}} {{cite web |date=2006-02-13 |title=Viltis rasti Vasario 16-osios akto original<U+0105> vis labiau bl<U+0117>sta |url=http://www.lrytas.lt/?id=11398300311138538447&view=4 |publisher=Lietuvos rytas |accessdate=2007-02-06 }}</ref> Two [[facsimile]]s of the duplicate were produced, one in 1928 and the other in 1933. The 1928 facsimile is a closer reproduction of the Act in its original state; there are spelling errors, and the background is visually "noisy", while the 1933 facsimile shows the Act in an "improved" condition.<ref name=orig/>

===The signatories===
Most of the signatories of the Act remained active in the cultural and political life of independent Lithuania. [[Jonas Vilei<U+0161>is]] served in the [[Seimas]] and as [[mayor]] of [[Kaunas]];<ref>{{en icon}} {{cite encyclopedia | editor = Simas Su<U+017E>ied<U+0117>lis | encyclopedia = [[Encyclopedia Lituanica]] | title = Vilie<U+0161>is, Jonas | year = 1970-1978 | publisher = Juozas Kapo<U+010D>ius | volume = VI | location = Boston, Massachusetts | id = {{LCC|74-114275}} | pages = 124-125}}</ref> [[Saliamonas Banaitis]] was involved in finance, opening several banks.<ref>{{en icon}} {{cite encyclopedia | editor = Simas Su<U+017E>ied<U+0117>lis | encyclopedia = [[Encyclopedia Lituanica]] | title = Banaitis, Saliamonas | year = 1970-1978 | publisher = Juozas Kapo<U+010D>ius | volume = I | location = Boston, Massachusetts | id = {{LCC|74-114275}} | pages = 282}}</ref> Among the signatories were two future Presidents of Lithuania, [[Antanas Smetona]] and [[Aleksandras Stulginskis]].

==Legacy==
[[Image:House of Signatories.jpg|thumb|left|220 px|The [[House of the Signatories]] on February 16, 2007]]
The Act of February 16 proclaimed the ''re''-establishment (''atstatyti'') of the Lithuanian state, making it the successor to the Lithuanian historical state, the [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]].<ref name=VL> {{lt icon}} {{cite web| url=http://www.lrs.lt/sventes/980216/vas16mod.htm| title=Vasario 16-oji - modernios Lietuvos valstyb<U+0117>s atk<U+016B>rimo simbolis ir pamatas |accessdate=2007-01-31| first=Vytautas |last=Landsbergis |authorlink=Vytautas Landsbergis|publisher=Seimas |date=1998-02-16}}</ref> In this respect the Council deviated from the resolution adopted by the Vilnius Conference which called for establishment (''sudaryti'') of a Lithuanian state.<ref name=maks/> However, it was made clear that the new state would be quite different from the old Duchy: it was to be organized only in ethnic Lithuanian lands and was to be governed by democratic principles,<ref name=maks/> as opposed to the multi-ethnic Duchy that had been ruled by aristocracy. The termination of the ties binding Lithuania to other states was addressed to Germany, Russia, and Poland, all of which had their own plans for the country.<ref name=VL/><ref name=Lina/> Even though not addressed directly, the Act renounced any attempt to resurrect the former [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth|Polish-Lithuanian union]].<ref name=Skirius/>

The Act of February 16, 1918, is the legal basis for the existence of present-day Lithuania, both during the [[interwar period]] and since 1990.<ref name=maks/> The Act became one of the key elements during the restoration of Lithuania's independence from the Soviet Union in 1990.<ref>{{en icon}} {{cite book |last= Ziemele |first= Ineta |title= Baltic Yearbook of International Law| year=2002| publisher= Martinus Nijhoff Publishers |pages=9 |isbn= 9041117369}}</ref><ref name=LRS>{{en icon}} {{cite web|url=http://www3.lrs.lt/seimu_istorija/w3_viewer.ViewTheme-p_int_tv_id=281&p_kalb_id=2&p_org=0.htm |title=Supreme Council - Reconstituent Seimas 1990 - 1992| accessdate=2007-01-30| publisher=Seimas| year=2002}}</ref> A paragraph in the [[Act of the Re-Establishment of the State of Lithuania]], delivered on [[March 11]] [[1990]], stated:<ref name=LRS/>

{{cquote| The Act of Independence of 16 February 1918 of the Council of Lithuania and the Constituent Assembly (Seimas) decree of 15 May 1920 on the re-established democratic State of Lithuania never lost their legal effect and comprise the constitutional foundation of the State of Lithuania.}}

This formulation emphasized the continuity of the two legal Acts. The Act of February 16, 1918 and its successor, the Act of March 11, 1990, are regarded as two of the most important developments of Lithuanian society in the 20th century.<ref name=VAR> {{lt icon}} {{cite journal|url=http://www.voruta.lt/article.php?article=726 |title=Vasario 16-osios Akto reik<U+0161>m<U+0117> lietuvi<U+0173> tautos politinei raidai| accessdate=2007-01-30| first=Antanas |last=Tyla |journal=Voruta |date=2005-03-06 |id=ISSN 1392-0677}}</ref>

Seimas (2001-05-24). Retrieved on [[2007-02-07]].</ref> On this day various ceremonies are hosted all across Lithuania, but the main commemoration is held in the [[House of Signatories]] in Vilnius where the Act was signed in 1918. During this observance the [[Flag of Lithuania]] is hoisted, and Lithuanian cultural activists and politicians deliver speeches from its balcony to the people gathered below. Special [[mass (liturgy)|masses]] in [[church]]es and [[cathedral]]s are also delivered. Honoring the Act's legacy, the [[President of Lithuania]] hosts a reception for the signatories of the Act of March 11, 1990, in the [[Presidential Palace, Vilnius|Presidential Palace]].

In 1992, an award was established in honor of Jonas Basanavi<U+010D>ius, who led the Council of Lithuania when the Act of February 16 was signed. The Jonas Basanavi<U+010D>ius Prize is bestowed for distinguished work within the previous five years in the fields of ethnic and cultural studies.<ref>{{lt icon}} {{cite web|url=http://whatson.delfi.lt/archive/article.php?id=8031858 |title=J.Basanavi<U+010D>iaus premija <U+0161>iemet skirta mokslo istorikui L.Klimkai| accessdate=2007-02-07| publisher=Delfi.lt and BNS| date=2005-11-21}}</ref> The prize is awarded in the House of Signatories, in homage to its history.
