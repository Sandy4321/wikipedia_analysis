'''''Over the Rainbow''''' is [[Connie Talbot]]'s debut album, released 26 November 2007 by Rainbow Recording Company. It received poor reviews from critics and peaked at No. 35 on the British charts. Despite this, additional copies of the album had to be pressed after sales were higher than expected. Most of the album's recording was done in a spare room in the house of Talbot's aunt, in an attempt to preserve her childhood by not interrupting her regular activities. Although initially public appearances were kept to a minimum, Talbot did make appearances to promote the album, and performed in public several times after the British release. She later toured Asia in support of the album. ''Over the Rainbow'' achieved more success on the Asian charts, reaching number one in Taiwan, South Korea and Hong Kong.

''Over the Rainbow'' was rereleased on 18 June 2008 with an updated tracklist, replacing some of the [[Christmas music|Christmas themed tracks]] with more general [[Cover (music)|covers]]. The first single from the album, "[[Three Little Birds (Connie Talbot song)|Three Little Birds]]," was released in June 2008, and a music video for the song was shot in Jamaica. On 14 October, the album was released in the US, appearing on several ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' charts. Talbot visited the US to promote the album, appearing on national television.

The album was received mostly negatively by critics. Sharon Mawer, of [[Allmusic]], praised ''Over the Rainbow'' by saying "[Talbot] can sing, for a seven-year old, and most of the notes (if not all of them) are in the right order and sung to the right pitch; the timing is fine too".<ref name="AMG review"/> However, she criticised the album, saying "there's no feeling, no emotion, no realization of what each song is about; they're just pretty little songs", giving the album 2/5.<ref name="AMG review">{{cite web |url= {{Allmusic|class=album|id=r1263941|pure_url=yes}}|title= Over the Rainbow|accessdate=5 April 2008 |last= Mawer|first= Sharon|publisher= [[Allmusic]]}}</ref> Nick Levine, of [[Digital Spy]], said in a review of the album that Talbot had a "sweet, pure voice", but that there is "no nuance or depth to her performance".<ref name="DS">{{cite web |url= http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/music/a81156/connie-talbot-over-the-rainbow.html|title= Connie Talbot: 'Over The Rainbow'|accessdate=5 December 2007 |last= Levine|first= Nick|date= 3 December 2007|publisher=[[Digital Spy]]}}</ref> However, he said that "There's something inherently wrong about awarding a star rating to a seven-year-old", and that "the decidedly adult concept of musical merit should have nothing to do with [her music]", rating the album 2/5.<ref name="DS"/> Reviewers in the ''Harlow Star'' also commented on her age, saying "There's no doubt she's a sweet little girl with a nice voice, but surely there's something inherently wrong with thrusting a child into the limelight at such a young age?"<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.hertsandessexobserver.co.uk/hertsandessex-leisure-music/DisplayArticle.asp?ID=238319|title= CD Reviews|accessdate=5 December 2007 |last= Wilkinson|first= Ben|coauthors= Tanfield, Jim; Moss, Chris|publisher=''Harlow Star''}}</ref> Rashvin Bedi, writing for Malaysian newspaper ''[[The Star (Malaysia)|The Star]]'', praised the album, saying that "Connie sings with ease and manages the high notes admirably", but asked whether "people would buy an album of the same songs sung by a 20-year-old girl".<ref>{{cite news |first= Rashvin|last= Bedi|title= Over the Rainbow|url= http://www.star-ecentral.com/music/reviews/review.asp?file=archives/music/2008/11/OvertheRainbow&artist=CONNIE%20TALBOT&title=Over%20the%20Rainbow&sec=Music|publisher= ''[[The Star (Malaysia)|The Star]]''|accessdate=11 November 2008 }}</ref>
