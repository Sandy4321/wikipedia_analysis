'''Anacropora''' is a [[genus]] of [[Scleractinia|stony corals]] in the [[Acroporidae]] family. They are sometimes called '''briar corals''' and there are seven known [[species]].

==Description==
Members of this genus are generally fragile corals with branches less than ten centimetres long which form small colonies. The branches are either spreading or may be clustered and are sometimes fused together. The calices are rounded and up to one millimetre in diameter. The area between the calices is porous with numerous small tubercles. There are no axial corallites and the main septa number six with a few more subsidiary ones.<ref name=Scl>[http://biophysics.sbg.ac.at/coral/acropor.htm Classification of Scleractinian (Stony) Corals]</ref> The small radial corallites have an <U+2018>empty<U+2019> appearance  similar to ''[[Montipora]]''. The delicate tentacles can often be seen extended during the day.<ref>[http://www.coralhub.info/cf/a-z/anacropora/ Coral hub: ''Anacropora'']</ref>
