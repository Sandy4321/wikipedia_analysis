'''''Flash Gordon''''' is a science fiction television series based on the characters of the [[Alex Raymond]]-created [[Flash Gordon|comic strip of the same name]]. Diverging from the storyline of the comics, the series set Flash, [[Dale Arden]] and [[Hans Zarkov|Dr. Zarkov]] in the year 3203. As agents of the Galactic Bureau of Investigation, the team travels the galaxy in their ship the ''Sky Flash'', battling cosmic villains under the order of Commander Paul Richards.

The series was filmed in [[West Berlin]]<ref>{{cite news

The series proved popular with American audiences and critical response, though sparse, was positive. ''Flash Gordon'' has garnered little modern critical attention. What little there is generally dismisses the series, although there has been some critical thought devoted to its presentation of [[Cold War]] and capitalist themes.

* [[Henry Beckman]] as Commander Richards

==Production==
[[Universal Studios]] had held the production rights to ''Flash Gordon'' but allowed them to lapse. Former Universal executives Edward Gruskin and Matty Fox struck a deal with Flash Gordon owners [[King Features Syndicate]] to produce the first 26 episodes of the series.<ref name = dixon97>Dixon, p. 97</ref> The series was produced by Gruskin and Wenzel L<U+00FC>decke.<ref name = dixon324>Dixon, p. 324</ref> Writers for ''Flash Gordon'' included Gruskin, [[Bruce Geller]] and Earl Markham. Episodes were directed by [[Wallace Worsley, Jr.]] and [[Gunther von Fritsch]].<ref name = dixon324 /> Composers Kurt Heuser and [[Roger Roger (composer)|Roger Roger]] provided much of the original music. 

Shooting got underway in May 1953, with an abandoned beer hall in [[Spandau]] serving as the principle shooting location.<ref name = dixon98>Dixon, p. 98</ref> Among the cast and crew, only the lead actors and director Worsley spoke English. Worsley would recall the production difficulties this caused: <blockquote>"No matter what galaxy we explored, everyone spoke with a German accent. The use of German actors who could not speak English required us to use a lot of close-ups. I would stand behind the camera, correctly positioned for the actor's look, and read his or her line; the actor would then repeat the line, mimicking my pronunciation and emphasis."<ref> Worsley, p. 69; quoted in Dixon, p. 98</ref></blockquote>

The series was budgeted at [[USD]]15,000 per episode<ref name = dixon97 /> on a three-day-per episode shooting schedule. Citing salary disputes, Worsley withdrew from the project after completing the first 26 episodes. Production was moved to [[Marseille]] under the direction of Gunther von Fritsch for the 13 final episodes.<ref name = dixon98 />

==Critical response and themes==
''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' noted that the series was from a technical standpoint "up to the demands of the script and the average viewer probably won't notice the differences in quality between this and home-grown produce".<ref>quoted in Dixon, p. 98</ref> ''Flash Gordon'' was immediately popular in the United States and continued to run in syndication into the early 1960s.<ref name = dixon100>Dixon, p. 100</ref>

Modern critical reaction to the series has been light but largely negative. The production values are frequently derided, with the series described as "bargain-basement".<ref>Bassoir, pg. 25</ref> The televised series suffered in comparison to the earlier film serials with the television incarnation labeled "vastly inferior," lacking "good concepts and scripts" and "most of all, [lacking] [[Buster Crabbe]], who ''was'' Flash Gordon".<ref>Harmon, et. al., p. 45</ref> One positive comment notes Champlin's portrayal of Dale Arden, who was transformed from the typical [[damsel in distress]] of the serials into a trained scientist and a "quick thinker who often saved [Flash and Zarkov] from perishing".<ref>Terrace, p. 46</ref>

Film theorist [[Wheeler Winston Dixon]], far from decrying the series for its production values, finds that "the copious [use of] stock footage and the numerous exterior sequences shot in the ruins of the bombed-out metropolis give ''Flash Gordon'' a  distinctly ravaged look".<ref>Dixon, pp. 98<U+2013>9</ref> He writes that its international origins give the series "an interesting new cultural dimension, even a perceptible air of a split cultural identity".<ref name = dixon98 />  Dixon quotes German cultural historian Mark Baker, who writes of a particular scene from the episode ''The Brain Machine'' as emblematic of this cultural split. The scene uses stock footage of a June 17, 1953 demonstration by East Berlin workers against the East German government. Soviet tanks opened fire on both demonstrators and bystanders, thus confirming East Germany's status as a Soviet puppet state in the minds of West Germans. American viewers, Baker speculates, were probably unaware of the iconic power in West Germany of the images of fleeing East Berlinners, which were used to illustrate a panic on Neptune.<ref>Dixon, p. 99</ref>

Dixon, noting the similarities between the ideals espoused by "space operas" like ''Flash Gordon'', ''[[Captain Video and His Video Rangers|Captain Video]]'' and ''[[Rocky Jones, Space Ranger]]'' and American [[Cold War]] values, argues that such series were designed to instill those values into their young viewers.<ref>Dixon, pp. 93<U+2013>4</ref>  ''Flash Gordon'', he writes, along with its fellow space operas, "have a common, unifying theme: peace in the universe can be achieved only by dangerous efforts and the unilateral dominance of the Western powers."<ref name = dixon100 /> This echoes the earlier critique of Soviet writer G. Avarin, who in the Soviet film journal ''Art of the Cinema'' had accused Gordon and other space-faring characters of being "the vanguard of a new and greater 'American imperialism'".<ref>{{cite news
