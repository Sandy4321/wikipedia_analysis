The '''Queen's Theatre''' is a building of historic importance in Playhouse Lane, [[Adelaide]], South Australia, the oldest such in mainland Australia, but predated by [[Theatre Royal, Hobart|Theatre Royal]] in Hobart, Tasmania. It was not the first theatre in Adelaide however, that being Samson Cameron's short-lived Royal Victoria Theatre on North Terrace <!--a converted warehouse behind where the Black Bull hotel later stood-->which opened on 23 November 1839.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article27440983 |title=Royal Vicoria Theatre |newspaper=[[South_Australian_Register|South Australian Register (Adelaide, SA : 1839 - 1900)]] |location=Adelaide, SA |date=16 November 1839 |accessdate=10 August 2012 |page=3 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}</ref>

The Southern Australian's prognostications proved correct and the last play was staged around 28 November 1842. Some use was made of the theatre for public meetings and lectures, and Solomon offered it to the government ''gratis'' if they would prohibit the building of further taverns in the vicinity (his Shakspere Tavern,<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article50246683 |title=Advertising. |newspaper=[[South_Australian_Register|South Australian Register (Adelaide, SA : 1839 - 1900)]] |location=Adelaide, SA |date=7 February 1849 |accessdate=10 August 2012 |page=2 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}</ref> subsequently named Temple Tavern, was adjacent). This was rejected, but in 1843 the government signed a contract with Solomon for three years' rental at <U+00A3>200 per annum for use as Resident Magistrates Court, Supreme Court and offices for the Registrar General, the Advocate General, the Assistant Crown Solicitor and Assistant to the Bench of Magistrates.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article37115150 |title=South Australia |newspaper=[[The Australian |The Australian (Sydney, NSW : 1824 - 1848)]] |location=Sydney, NSW |date=24 July 1843 |accessdate=8 August 2012 |page=3 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}</ref> 

Between 1846 and 1847 Solomon, whose nephew [[Judah Moss Solomon]] (1818 &ndash; 1880) was an occasional partner, attempted to sell the theatre and tavern by lottery, but it was never fully subscribed so he refunded to the punters their stakes.

It reopened, re-using the name '''Royal Victoria Theatre''', under the management of [[John Lazar]] and [[George Coppin]], on 23 December 1850,<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article38437326 |title=The Theatre |newspaper=[[South_Australian_Register|South Australian Register (Adelaide, SA : 1839 - 1900)]] |location=Adelaide, SA |date=24 December 1850 |accessdate=9 August 2012 |page=3 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}</ref> and was Adelaide's only theatre until the opening of the Theatre Royal at 28 [[Hindley Street, Adelaide|Hindley Street]] on 13 April 1868,<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article55153409 |title=Old-Time Theatres |newspaper=[[South_Australian_Register|The Register (Adelaide, SA : 1901 - 1929)]] |location=Adelaide, SA |date=6 January 1921 |accessdate=9 August 2012 |page=5 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}</ref> which spelled the demise of the "Victoria".

It then became successively a dance hall designated the "Prado",<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article39198678 |title=The Dancing Saloons and Night-Houses |newspaper=[[South_Australian_Register|South Australian Register (Adelaide, SA : 1839 - 1900)]] |location=Adelaide, SA |date=28 June 1870 |accessdate=9 August 2012 |page=6 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}</ref> the headquarters for the [[Mission Australia|City Mission]],<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article39264368 |title=The City Mission |newspaper=[[South_Australian_Register|South Australian Register (Adelaide, SA : 1839 - 1900)]] |location=Adelaide, SA |date=15 August 1872 |accessdate=9 August 2012 |page=4 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}</ref> a horse market<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article56073135 |title=Early Experiences on South Australia |newspaper=[[South_Australian_Register|The Register (Adelaide, SA : 1901 - 1929)]] |location=Adelaide, SA |date=27 March 1901 |accessdate=9 August 2012 |page=7 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}</ref> and other commercial uses, and finally a car park.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article57055963 |title=Gilles Arcade |newspaper=[[South_Australian_Register|The Register (Adelaide, SA : 1901 - 1929)]] |location=Adelaide, SA |date=14 July 1928 |accessdate=9 August 2012 |page=13 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}</ref>

===Recent development===
The building was purchased by the South Australian Asset Management Corporation and transferred to Heritage SA in the 1980s. Excavation revealed historically significant remains and numerous artefacts.

The Queen's Theatre was reopened as a performance venue at the 1996 Adelaide Festival of Arts, with a performance of [[The Magic Flute]] by [[Opera Australia]]. Following essential refurbishments, it was reopened  for the launch of the 1998 Festival of Arts by [[Robyn Archer]].<ref>http://www.liveguide.com.au/Venues/6518/Queens_Theatre</ref>

The theatre is now used as a performance space and function venue, but with stringent conditions intended to preserve as far as possible, the old character of the building.<ref>http://www.yelp.com.au/biz/queens-theatre-adelaide</ref>

==New Queen's Theatre==
A new theatre was built in 1846 for [[George Coppin]] on nearby land on Light Square belonging to Solomon and managed by John Lazar. The hall held 700 and had the distinction of prohibiting smoking in the [[box (theatre)|boxes]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article71606193 |title=Advertising. |newspaper=[[South Australian |South Australian (Adelaide, SA : 1844 - 1851)]] |location=Adelaide, SA |date=23 October 1846 |accessdate=8 August 2012 |page=2 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}</ref> A critique of a show at New Queen's Theatre was the occasion of a court case against editor [[John Stephens (editor)|John Stephens]] in 1850. There is no newspaper reference to this theatre after November 1850.
