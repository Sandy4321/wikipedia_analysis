'''Tintinhull Garden''', located in [[Tintinhull]], near [[Yeovil]] in the English county of [[Somerset]], is a small 20th century [[Arts and Crafts movement|Arts and Crafts]] [[garden]] surrounding a 17th-century Grade I [[Listed building (United Kingdom)|listed]] house. The property is in the ownership of the [[National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty|National Trust]]. It is visited by around 25,000 people per year.<ref name=hegarty/>

The house started as a small farmhouse in 1630 but was enlarged into its current form in the 18th century. The house was the property of the Napper family for centuries. It was given to the National Trust in 1954. The [[Arts and Crafts movement|Arts and Crafts]] style garden is modeled on that at [[Hidcote Manor Garden]] in Gloucestershire. It was originally laid out by [[Phyllis Reiss]] and developed by [[Penelope Hobhouse]].

==House==
The original farmhouse which forms the basis of the current Tintinhull House was built of [[Hamstone]] 1630. It was reshaped and enlarged around 1722 when the west fa<U+00E7>ade was added.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=66505 |title=Parishes: Tintinhull |author=R. W.

The house was the property of the Napper family, who acquired the manor after the [[Dissolution of the Monasteries]] and also owned [[Tintinhull Court]], and was passed down in the family until they sold it sometime after 1814.<ref name="nhlehouse">{{English Heritage List entry |num=1265231 |desc=Tintinhull House|accessdate=5 April 2015}}</ref><ref name=nhlegarden/>

The Nappers let it to the Pitt family until the death of John Napper in 1791. It passed through several hands until 1835, when it was bought by Jeremiah Penny. In 1898 the then owner, Arthur Cobbett, added a single-storey extension to the east front before selling it to his tenant the botanist, Dr. S.J.M. Price. In 1933 it was bought by Phyllis Reiss and her husband, Capt. F.E. Reiss.<ref name="hailes">{{cite web|url=http://www.juliahailes.com/AboutMe-1994-2004.htm|title=Tintinhull House|last=Hailes|first=Julia|publisher=Julia Hailes|accessdate=4 October 2010}}</ref>

The garden is laid out into areas separated by walls and hedges.

The garden layout was developed in the early 20th century, by Dr. Price, including laying down traingular and diamond shaped flagstone paths. The ornamental domes of [[Buxus sempervirens|box]] were planted in the 1920s.<ref name=bond>{{cite book |last=Bond |first=James |title=Somerset Parks and Gardens |publisher=Somerset Books |year=1998 |isbn=978-0-86183-465-5|pages=139<U+2013>140}}</ref> The early landscaping was expanded and planted starting in 1933 by [[Phyllis Reiss]] in a [[Arts and Crafts movement|Arts and Crafts]] "[[Hidcote Manor Garden|Hidcote]]" style.<ref name=hegarty>{{cite news|last=Hegarty|first=Lesley|title=Treasures at Tintinhull|url=http://www.somerset-life.co.uk/homes-gardens/gardens/treasures_at_tintinhull_1_1645631|accessdate=15 December 2013|newspaper=Somerset Life|date=29 June 2011}}</ref> The {{convert|1.5|acre}} garden is separated into "rooms" by Yew hedges and walls.<ref>{{cite web|title=Tintinhull House Garden|url=http://www.greatbritishgardens.co.uk/england/item/tintinhull-house-and-garden.html|publisher=Great British Gardens|accessdate=22 January 2015}}</ref> The different areas include Eagle Court (the former courtyard), Middle Garden, Fountain Garden and Pool Garden.<ref name=hegarty/> The pool garden is the site of a former tennis court.<ref name=bond/>

In 1954 Reiss gave the house and garden to the National Trust, but continued to live in the house and care for the garden until her death in 1961. From then on, the Trust let the house to a variety of tenants, including the [[garden design]]er and writer [[Penelope Hobhouse]] and her husband Prof John Malins from 1980 to 1993.<ref>{{cite web|title=Tintinhull House Garden|url=http://www.gardenvisit.com/garden/tintinhull_house_garden|publisher=Garden Visit|accessdate=15 December 2013}}</ref>

The gardens are included in the [[National Register of Historic Parks and Gardens]] and include small pools and an azelea garden.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/tintinhull-garden/|title=Tintinhull Garden|publisher=National Trust|accessdate=8 June 2009}}</ref>
