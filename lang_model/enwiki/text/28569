The '''Fifth Down''' was the name of a [[college football]] play that was the result of an error by the crew officiating the game.  This play enabled the [[University of Colorado at Boulder|Colorado]] [[Colorado Buffaloes|Buffaloes]] to defeat the [[University of Missouri<U+2013>Columbia|Missouri]] [[Missouri Tigers|Tigers]] by scoring a touchdown on the last play of their game on [[October 6]], [[1990]].  The ensuing controversy cast doubt on Colorado's claim to [[Division I]]-A's 1990 [[NCAA Division I-A national football championship|national championship]]. It has been called one of the top memorable moments and blunders in college football history.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.usatoday.com/sports/college/football/2002-11-19-memorable-moments_x.htm | title=College football's best of the last 20 years | publisher=USA Today | date=2002-11-19 | accessdate=2006-11-21 | language=English | format=HTML}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.nd.edu/~tmandell/finishestable.html | title=HEART STOPPERS AND HAIL MARYS | author=Ted Mandell | publisher=Hardwood Press | language=English | format=Book/CD | date=2005-09-25 | accessdate=2006-11-21}}</ref>

In [[American football]], a team is allowed four attempts or "[[Down (football)|downs]]" to move the ball ten [[yard]]s towards the [[goal line]].  If the offense moves ten yards in four attempts or less, it gains a "first down," which restarts the process.  If, after four attempts, the offense has neither scored nor gained ten yards, the other team is given possession of the ball.  Under normal circumstances (for example, excluding penalties which can involve replaying a down), no team is supposed to be allowed five attempts. However, due to an officiating error, Colorado was given a fifth down which they used to score the game-winning [[touchdown]] as time expired.

The game pitted the Colorado Buffaloes (CU) against their [[Big Eight Conference]] rival, the Missouri Tigers (MU), and was played on [[October 6]], [[1990]] in front of a crowd of 46,856.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.cubuffs.com/ViewArticle.dbml?SPSID=3850&SPID=255&DB_OEM_ID=600&ATCLID=291606 | title=No. 12 Colorado 33, Missouri 31 | publisher=CUBuffs.com | date=1990-10-06 | accessdate=2006-11-21 | language=English | format=HTML}}</ref>  The game was played at [[Faurot Field]], Missouri's home stadium in [[Columbia, Missouri]].

The lead in this game changed several times, and several big plays kept the momentum swinging. With less than three minutes to go, Colorado took possession of the ball deep in its own territory trailing by the score of 31&ndash;27. Johnson led the team on a last-ditch drive. With about 40 seconds to go, he completed a pass to a Colorado [[tight end]] who fell down just yards short of the goal line. The tight end slipped due to the poor conditions of the field.<ref name="Johnson" /><ref name="McCSlip">{{cite web | url=http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1208/is_n1_v221/ai_19006779 | title=Where have you gone, Ted Williams? - dubious sports feats | date=1997-01-06 | accessdate=2007-01-10 | language=English | format=HTML | publisher=Sporting News, The (via findarticles.com}}</ref> This play gave the Buffaloes a first down, but it led to immediate confusion because the Buffs were running a [[hurry-up offense]].

On first down, Johnson [[Glossary of American football#s|spiked]] the ball to stop the clock. On second down, a power run into the line by [[Eric Bienemy]] was stopped just short of the goal line. But the officiating crew forgot to flip the down marker to note that it was now third down. On the next play, the Buffaloes made the same call and Bienemy was again stopped short of the end zone. Johnson then spiked the ball to stop the clock with two seconds left. He later claimed that he had no idea the officials had made a mistake, and believed he was spiking the ball on third down.<ref name="Johnson" /> On the following play &ndash; fourth down according to the marker, but "fifth down" in reality &ndash; Johnson kept the ball himself. Although there was some question as to whether he had broken the plane of the goal line,<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.columbiatribune.com/2005/FirstAndTen/20050825FirstAndTen005.asp | title=Why can<U+2019>t they win? | author=JOE WALLJASPER | date=2005-08-25 | accessdate=2006-11-21 | language=English | format=HTML}}</ref> the officials awarded Colorado a touchdown.

Referee J.C. Louderback and the Big Eight officiating crew conferred for nearly 20 minutes to decide their course of action. During the delay, radio and television announcers noticed that Colorado had scored with the help of an additional play. Louderback was shown on the phone. After a lengthy consultation, the referees announced their decision: It was a touchdown, and Colorado would now have to run the extra-point conversion. Not wanting to take any risks with only a two-point lead, the Buffaloes snapped the ball and downed it to end a controversial 33-31 contest.<ref>The rules have since changed not requiring the extra point try if time has expired and the result will not affect the outcome of the game</ref><ref name="OT">{{cite web | url=http://www.usatoday.com/sports/college/football/2006-08-24-overtime_x.htm | title=Overtime system still excites coaches | publisher=USAToday.com | author=Kelly Whiteside | date=2006-08-24 | accessdate=2006-11-21 | language=English | format=HTML}}</ref>

== Fallout ==

Colorado football coach [[Bill McCartney]], a former Missouri Tigers player, did little to soothe the controversy.  Asked whether he would consider [[forfeit]]ing the game, McCartney declared that he had considered it but decided against it because "the field was lousy."  (He complained about the unusually slick Omniturf [[artificial turf]] surface, which he said had caused repeated slips and falls during the game.<ref name="McCSlip" />) 

The NCAA football rules<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ncaa.org/library/rules/2005/2005_football_rules.pdf|title=NCAA football rules|year=2005|format=PDF|language=English|accessdate=2007-01-10}}</ref> disallow an official forfeit.  In American football, a decision made by the officials during the course of play cannot be reversed after the game ends.  If the "fifth down" play had occurred earlier, so that time remained on the clock when the play ended, the play could have been nullified. An [[Instant replay]] allows officiating mistakes to be corrected by reviewing (or replaying) recorded video feeds of the sporting match in order to ensure that the correct call is made on the play. However, this is done during the game and no review after the game could overturn an officials call during the game.

Closure came in the summer of 1998 &ndash; four years after McCartney retired as the Buffs head coach &ndash; when he admitted to making mistakes and being saddened by the Fifth Down fiasco. McCartney made the remarks at a [[Promise Keepers]] gathering at the site of the controversy, Columbia, Missouri.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/football/college/news/1998/06/20/mccartney_fifthdown/ | title=McCartney 'remorseful' about fifth-down play | author=AP | publisher=CNN.com | date=1998-06-20 | accessdate=2006-11-21 | language=English | format=HTML}}</ref>

== National championship ==

{{seealso|NCAA Division I-A national football championship}}
The [[National Collegiate Athletic Association]] (NCAA) governs American football as played by the teams representing the largest universities in the United States, termed Division I-A. Although smaller schools participate in formal NCAA tournaments to determine the national college football championships in Divisions I-AA, II, and III, Division I-A lacks such a tournament.  

The "[[Mythical National Championship|mythical national championship]]" of Division I-A is determined by polls of experts. In the early 1990s, two such polls were regarded as authoritative: a poll of sportswriters conducted by the [[Associated Press]] (AP) called the [[AP Poll]], and a poll of college football coaches conducted by the [[American Football Coaches Association]] called the [[Coaches Poll]]. These polls are conducted weekly during the football season, and the final poll (in January, after all [[bowl game]]s) determines the championship. 

Because [[1990]] was a year in which no single college football team was dominant, the Fifth Down controversy played a role in determining the Division I-A national champion for the 1990 season. The Missouri game caused Colorado's ranking to decline to 14th.  However, most of the top teams lost in subsequent weeks, while the Buffaloes won their remaining games, including squeakers over highly-rated [[University of Nebraska|Nebraska]] and [[Notre Dame University|Notre Dame]]. The [[Orange Bowl]] victory over Notre Dame was considered very controversial as well, due to a questionable [[American football rules#Penalties against the offense|clipping]] call on the [[Notre Dame Fighting Irish|Irish]] on a [[Punt (football)|punt]] return touchdown late in the game by [[Raghib Ismail]] when Colorado held a 10-9 lead, which would be the final score after Notre Dame was assessed the penalty.

Colorado finished the 1990 season with a record of 11&ndash;1&ndash;1 (eleven wins, one loss and one tie),<ref name="CUSched" /> while the [[Georgia Institute of Technology|Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets']] record was 11&ndash;0&ndash;1, (eleven wins, zero losses and one tie).<ref>{{cite web | url=http://graphics.fansonly.com/photos/schools/geot/sports/m-footbl/auto_pdf/06-mg-scores.pdf | title=2006 Georgia Tech Media Guide | publisher=RAMBLINWRECK.com | accessdate=2007-01-02 | date=2006 | format=PDF | language=English}}, page 188</ref> No Division I-A team had an unblemished record, and only Georgia Tech finished without a loss.<ref>NCAA football rules permitted ties in 1990.  Subsequent rule changes in 1996 introduced overtime play, so that all games since are victories for one team or the other.</ref><ref name="OT" />

Observers favoring Colorado for the national championship noted that they had played a more difficult schedule than Georgia Tech.  Those favoring Georgia Tech pointed to the Yellow Jackets' undefeated status and to the tainted victory achieved by Colorado at Missouri in the "Fifth Down" game.  With a loss at Missouri, the Colorado record would have been 10&ndash;2&ndash;1, and the Buffaloes surely would not have been considered for the national title with that record.

After the conclusion of the [[1990 NCAA Division I-A football season|1990 season]], in January, 1991, the AP Poll voted Colorado national champions.  The Coaches Poll voted the championship to Georgia Tech.  Both universities therefore claim the 1990 championship. More recently, the [[Bowl Championship Series]] (BCS) was established to create a [[BCS National Championship Game|National Championship Game]] for college football in which the top two ranked teams in the BCS Rankings (which takes into account both human polls and six computer rankings).  However, the BCS has not been without controversy or eliminated split championships. In 2003, LSU was voted number one in the Coaches Poll while USC was voted atop the AP Poll and therefore split the national championship.

Missouri ended the season 4-7 (four wins, seven losses).<ref name="MUSched" />

== Precedent ==

Similar events had occurred in college football prior to Colorado's Fifth Down. In 1940, an [[Ivy League]] contest between [[Dartmouth College|Dartmouth]] and [[Cornell University|Cornell]] ended similarly. Cornell completed the game-winning touchdown pass on a mistaken fifth down. After officials reviewed game film, they discovered their error. By agreement of the Cornell players, coach, and athletic director, Cornell forfeited the game to Dartmouth by telegram. (Cornell had entered the game with 18 straight wins.) This game is therefore regarded as a 3-0 Dartmouth victory, instead of a 7-3 triumph by Cornell.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.ivyleaguesports.com/documents/cor-041106.asp | title=Cornell Big Red hosts Dartmouth Big Green | publisher=IvyLeagueSports.com | accessdate=2006-11-21 | language=English | format=HTML}}</ref> Although there is some doubt whether the Cornell forfeit was "official" according to NCAA rules, the general public recognizes the Cornell telegram of forfeit.

Fifth downs occur at other times as well, though rare.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.buckeyextra.com/?story=xtrasandos/2003/09-29-2003/jack-full.php | title=OSU overcomes Wisconsin's 'fifth down' | author=Jack Park | publisher=BuckeyeExtra.com | accessdate=2006-11-21 | language=English | format=HTML}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/sportsline/main9781262.shtml | title=Judgements: Ravens offense still never-scores | author=Clark Judge | publisher=CBSNews.com | date=2006-11-05 | accessdate=2006-11-21 | language=English | format=HTML}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.pressboxonline.com/blog.cfm?ID=171 | title=Sun., Nov. 5: Real Deal Or No Deal?
