'''Benjamin Oliver Davis Jr.''' (December 18, 1912 <U+2013> July 4, 2002) was an [[United States|American]] [[United States Air Force]] [[general (United States)|general]] and commander of the [[World War II]] [[Tuskegee Airmen]].

Davis was the first [[African-American]] general in the [[United States Air Force]].  On December 9, 1998, he was advanced to [[List of United States Air Force four-star generals|four-star general]] by the President. During World War II, Davis was commander of the 99th and the [[332nd Fighter Group]], which escorted bombers on air combat missions over Europe. Davis himself flew sixty missions in [[P-39]], [[Curtiss P-40]], [[P-47]] and [[P-51 Mustang]] fighters. Davis followed in his father's footsteps in breaking racial barriers, as [[Benjamin O. Davis, Sr.]] was the first African-American general in the [[United States Army]].

==Biography==
Benjamin Oliver Davis, Jr was born in [[Washington, D.C.]] on December 18, 1912, the second of three children born to [[Benjamin O. Davis, Sr.]] and Elnora Dickerson Davis. His father was a [[United States Army|U.S. Army]] officer, and at the time was stationed in [[Wyoming]] serving as a lieutenant with an all-white [[cavalry]] unit. Benjamin O. Davis, Sr. served 41 years before he was promoted to brigadier general. Elnora Davis died from complications after giving birth to their third child (Elnora) in 1916.

At the age of 13, in the summer of 1926, the younger Davis went for a flight with a [[barnstorming]] pilot at [[Bolling Field]] in Washington, D.C. The experience led to his determination to become a pilot himself. He was the first officer to get his wings from the Tuskegee Army Air Field on March 7, 1942.

After attending the [[University of Chicago]], he entered the [[United States Military Academy]] at [[West Point, New York|West Point]], [[New York]] in 1932. He was sponsored by Representative [[Oscar De Priest]] (R-IL) of [[Chicago, Illinois|Chicago]], at the time, the only black member of [[United States Congress|Congress]]. During the entire four years of his Academy term, Davis was shunned by his classmates, few of whom spoke to him outside the line of duty. He never had a roommate. He ate by himself. His classmates hoped that this would drive him out of the Academy. The "silent treatment" had the opposite effect. It made Davis more determined to graduate. Nevertheless, he earned the respect of his classmates, as evidenced by the biographical note beneath his picture in the 1936 yearbook, the ''Howitzer'':

<blockquote>"The courage, tenacity, and intelligence with which he conquered a problem incomparably more difficult than plebe year won for him the sincere admiration of his classmates, and his single-minded determination to continue in his chosen career cannot fail to inspire respect wherever fortune may lead him."<ref name=WWIIVets>{{cite journal|accessdate=

He graduated in 1936, 35th in a class of 278. He was the academy's fourth black graduate. When he was commissioned as a second lieutenant, the Army had a grand total of two black line officers <U+2014> Benjamin O. Davis, Sr. and Benjamin O. Davis, Jr. After graduation he married Agatha Scott.

At the start of his senior year at West Point, Davis had applied for the [[United States Army Air Corps|Army Air Corps]] but was rejected because it did not accept blacks. He was instead assigned to the all-black 24th Infantry Regiment (one of the original [[Buffalo Soldier]] regiments) at [[Fort Benning, Georgia]]. He was not allowed inside the base officers' club.

He later attended the [[U.S. Army Infantry School]] at Fort Benning, but then was assigned to teach [[military tactics]] at [[Tuskegee Institute]], a [[Historically_black_college_or_university|historically black college]] in [[Tuskegee]], [[Alabama]]. This was something his father had done years before. It was the Army's way to avoid having a black officer in command of white soldiers.

Early in 1941, the [[Franklin D. Roosevelt|Roosevelt]] administration, in response to public pressure for greater black participation in the military as war approached, ordered the [[United States Department of War|War Department]] to create a black flying unit. Captain Davis was assigned to the first training class at Tuskegee Army Air Field (hence the name [[Tuskegee Airmen]]), and in March 1942 won his wings as one of five black officers to complete the course. He was the first black officer to solo an Army Air Corps aircraft. In July that year, having been promoted to lieutenant colonel, he was named commander of the first all-black air unit, the [[99th Flying Training Squadron|99th Pursuit Squadron]].

The squadron, equipped with [[Curtiss P-40]] fighters, was sent to [[Tunisia]] in North Africa in the spring of 1943. On June 2, they saw combat for the first time in a dive-bombing mission against the [[Germany|German]]-held island of [[Pantelleria]]. The squadron later supported the Allied invasion of [[Sicily]].

In September 1943, Davis was called back to the United States to take command of the 332nd Fighter Group, a larger all-black unit preparing to go overseas.

Soon after his arrival, however, there was an attempt to stop the use of black pilots in combat. Senior officers in the Army Air Forces recommended to the Army chief of staff, General [[George Marshall]], that the 99th (Davis's old unit) be removed from combat operations as it had performed poorly. This infuriated Davis as he had never been told of any deficiencies with the unit. He held a news conference at [[The Pentagon]] to defend his men and then presented his case to a War Department committee studying the use of black servicemen.

Marshall ordered an inquiry but allowed the 99th to continue fighting in the meantime. The inquiry eventually reported that the 99th's performance was comparable to other air units, but any questions about the squadron's fitness were answered in January 1944 when its pilots shot down 12 German planes in two days while protecting the Anzio beachhead.

Colonel Davis and his 332d Fighter Group arrived in [[Italy]] soon after that. The four-squadron group, which was called the Red Tails for the distinctive markings of its planes, were based at [[Ramitelli Airfield]] and flew many missions deep into German territory. By summer 1944 the Group had transitioned to [[P-47 Thunderbolt]]s.

In the summer of 1945, Davis took over the all-black [[477th Bombardment Group]], which was stationed at [[Godman Army Airfield|Godman Field]], [[Kentucky]].

During the war, the airmen commanded by Davis had compiled an outstanding record in combat against the [[Luftwaffe]]. They flew more than 15,000 sorties, shot down 111 enemy planes, and destroyed or damaged 273 on the ground at a cost of 66 of their own planes and losing only about twenty-five bombers.

Davis himself led dozens of missions in [[P-47 Thunderbolt]]s and [[P-51 Mustang]]s. He received the [[Silver Star]] for a strafing run into [[Austria]] and the [[Distinguished Flying Cross (United States)|Distinguished Flying Cross]] for a bomber-escort mission to [[Munich]] on June 9, 1944.

In July 1948, President [[Harry S. Truman]] signed an [[Executive order (United States)|executive order]] ordering the [[racial integration]] of the [[U.S Armed Forces|armed forces]]. Colonel Davis helped draft the Air Force plan for implementing this order. The Air Force was the first of the services to integrate fully.

Davis served at the Pentagon and in overseas posts over the next two decades. He again saw combat in 1953 when he assumed command of the [[51st Fighter Wing|51st Fighter-Interceptor Wing]] (51 FIW) and flew an [[F-86 Sabre]] in [[Korean War|Korea]].

He served as Director of Operations and Training at Far East Air Forces Headquarters, Tokyo, from 1954 until 1955, when he assumed the position of Vice Commander, [[Thirteenth Air Force]] (13 AF), with additional duty as commander, Air Task Force 13 (Provisional), Taipei, Formosa. During his time in Tokyo he was temporarily promoted to the rank of Brigadier General, a rank not made permanent until after his temporary promotion to Major General.

In April 1957 General Davis arrived at [[Ramstein Air Base]], Germany, as chief of staff, [[Twelfth Air Force]] (12 AF), [[U.S. Air Forces in Europe]] ([[USAFE]]). When the [[Twelfth Air Force]] was transferred to [[James Connally Air Force Base]], Texas in December 1957, he assumed new duties as deputy chief of staff for operations, Headquarters [[U.S. Air Forces in Europe]] (USAFE), [[Wiesbaden Air Base]], Germany. While in Germany he was temporarily promoted to Major General in 1959, and his promotion to Brigadier General was finally made permanent in 1960.

In July 1961, he returned to the United States and Headquarters U.S. Air Force where he served as the Director of Manpower and Organization, Deputy Chief of Staff for Programs and Requirements, having his promotion to Major General made permanent early the next year; and in February 1965 he was assigned as assistant deputy chief of staff, programs and requirements. He remained in that position until his assignment as chief of staff for the United Nations Command and U.S. Forces in Korea (USFK) in April 1965, at which time he was promoted to Lieutenant General. He assumed command of the [[Thirteenth Air Force]] (13 AF) at [[Clark Air Base]] in the Republic of the Philippines in August 1967.

Davis was assigned as deputy commander in chief, [[U.S. Strike Command]], with headquarters at [[MacDill Air Force Base]], Florida, in August 1968, with additional duty as commander in chief, Middle-East, Southern Asia and Africa. He retired from active military service on February 1, 1970.
