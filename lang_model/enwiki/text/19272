In [[computing]], a '''base address''' is an [[address]] serving as a reference point ("base") for other addresses. 

In computers using ''relative addressing'' scheme, to obtain an [[absolute address]], the relevant base address is taken and [[Offset (computer science)|offset]] (aka displacement) is added to it.
