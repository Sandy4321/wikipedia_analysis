"'''Bass Down Low'''" is the debut single by American recording artist [[Dev (singer)|Dev]]. It was written by Dev alongside its producers, [[The Cataracs]], who also appeared on the track. The song was released on November 16, 2010, through [[Universal Republic Records|Universal Republic]] as the [[lead single]] for Dev's debut studio album, ''[[The Night the Sun Came Up]]'' (2011). Initially, the song was made for The Cataracs with Dev as the featured act, but she was made the main artist as they believed it would be a suitable follow-up to [[Far East Movement]]'s "[[Like a G6]]", which she appeared on. British rapper [[Tinie Tempah]] was featured on an official remix of "Bass Down Low" that was made for the song's release in the United Kingdom. Musically, "Bass Down Low" is an [[electro (music)|electro]] song with skittering synths and the lyrics speak of different forms of [[wiktionary:debauchery|debauchery]].

The song was met with positive reviews from critics. Commercially, "Bass Down Low" performed moderately in the United States, peaking at number 61 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] and number two on the [[Top Heatseekers]] chart. The song also reached the top forty in Canada and Ireland. It achieved its highest peak in the United Kingdom at number ten, and became Dev's second top ten hit on the chart, following "Like a G6". The accompanying music video for "Bass Down Low" takes place in an underground club. The clip was directed by Ethan Lader who took inspiration from fashion and the film ''[[Fight Club (film)|Fight Club]]''.
