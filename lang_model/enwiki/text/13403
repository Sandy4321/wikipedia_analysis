'''David Allen Wright''' (born December 20, 1982) is an American [[baseball]] player, who plays third base for the [[New York Mets]] of [[Major League Baseball]]. He was drafted by the Mets in 2001 and made his Major League debut in 2004. Wright was on the [[All-Star]] team in 2006, 2007, and 2008, and won the [[Gold Glove Award]] in 2007 and 2008.

==Biography==
David Wright was born December 20, 1982 in [[Norfolk, Virginia]] and brought up in [[Chesapeake, Virginia]].  Wright attended [[Hickory High School (Virginia)|Hickory High School]] in [[Chesapeake, Virginia]]. There, he was a three-time All-State selection and, as a senior, was named the Virginia Player of the Year. He also played on an [[Amateur Athletic Union]] team that included current [[Major League Baseball]] players [[Ryan Zimmerman]], [[B. J. Upton]], [[Justin Upton]] and [[Mark Reynolds (baseball)|Mark Reynolds]]. Although Wright had signed a letter of intent before his senior year to play baseball at [[Georgia Institute of Technology|Georgia Tech]] 
after high school, he opted to sign with the Mets after being selected in the supplemental first round of the draft.

==Professional career==

===Minor leagues===
Wright was chosen by the Mets in the [[2001 in baseball|2001]] [[Major League Baseball Draft|amateur draft]] during the supplemental round as compensation for the Mets' loss of [[Mike Hampton]] to the [[Colorado Rockies]] in free agency. Wright was selected after future teammate [[Aaron Heilman]] who had been selected in the first round.
Wright progressed steadily in his first three years of [[minor league]] play, winning the Sterling award for best player on the class A [[St. Lucie Mets]] in [[2003 in baseball|2003]]. In [[2004 in baseball|2004]], he quickly rose from the class AA [[Binghamton Mets]], to the AAA [[Norfolk Tides]], to the major leagues.

===Major leagues===
====2004====
On July 21, 2004, he made his major league debut starting at third base against the [[Montreal Expos]]. Since then, Wright has been the Mets regular starting third baseman.

During his first major league season, he had a .293 [[batting average]], 14 [[home runs]] and 40 [[RBI]] in 263 at bats in 69 games, and was voted as the [[This Year in Baseball Awards]] Rookie of the Year. Wright was coached by hitting instructor Kyle Simon and teammate [[Jason Phillips (catcher)|Jason Phillips]].

====2005====
In 2005, the 22-year-old Wright played in 160 games and batted .306 with 27 home runs, 99 runs, 102 RBI, 42 doubles, and 17 stolen bases, leading the team in average, runs, on-base percentage, slugging percentage, RBI, doubles, and finishing second in home runs to Cliff Floyd (34). Wright was also in the top ten in the [[National League]] for average, hits, total bases, RBI, extra base hits, and runs. Wright's 24 errors tied him with [[Troy Glaus]] for the most errors by a third baseman in the major leagues.<ref name="espn-error">[http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/stats/fielding?groupId=9&sortColumn=errors&sortOrder=true&split=81&qualified=null&season=2005&seasonType=2 ESPN - MLB Baseball Fielding Statistics and League Leaders - Major League Baseball<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

Wright caught a ball bare-handed and over the shoulder during the seventh inning of a game at [[PETCO Park]] against the [[San Diego Padres]] on August 9, 2005. With one out in the inning, [[Brian Giles]] hit a blooper 20 feet beyond the edge of the outfield grass. Wright, retreating quickly with his back to home plate, extended his bare right hand and caught the ball cleanly while crashing to the ground. Wright would maintain control of the ball after landing hard on the [[outfield]] grass. The sellout crowd at PETCO Park acknowledged the splendor of the catch with a standing ovation lasting several minutes. This play was voted the "This Year in Baseball Play of the Year."<ref name="TYIB">[http://mlb.mlb.com/NASApp/mlb/mlb/awards/y2005/tyib/index.jsp 2005 This Year in Baseball Awards]</ref>

====2006====
In 2006, Wright was named National League Co-Player of the Week for June 12-18 along with teammate [[Jos<U+00E9> Reyes (shortstop)|Jos<U+00E9> Reyes]].<ref name="PlayerOfTheWeek">[http://newyork.mets.mlb.com/NASApp/mlb/news/article.jsp?ymd=20060619&content_id=1513600&vkey=news_nym&fext=.jsp&c_id=nym Infielders share Player of Week honors]</ref> It was Wright's second Player of the Week award. He was also named National League [[Player of the Month]] for June, becoming the first Met since Howard Johnson in 1991 to capture the award.<ref name="PlayerOfTheMonth">[http://newyork.mets.mlb.com/NASApp/mlb/news/press_releases/press_release.jsp?ymd=20060703&content_id=1536755&vkey=pr_mlb&fext=.jsp&c_id=mlb David Wright of Mets and Chris Young of Padres voted National League Player and Pitcher of the Month for June]</ref> For the month, Wright batted .327 with 10 home runs and 29 RBI.

Wright also provided his share of heroics throughout the 2006 season. His first game-winning hit occurred on May 5 with a 2-out double just out of the reach of a chasing [[Andruw Jones]] in the bottom of the 14th inning off [[Jorge Sosa]] to defeat the Atlanta Braves, 8-7. Two weeks later on May 19, he hit a walk-off single off vaunted closer [[Mariano Rivera]] that just sailed over the head of center fielder [[Johnny Damon]] as the Mets rallied to beat the Yankees in the first game of the 2006 [[Subway Series]], 7-6. He capped off the month on Memorial Day, May 29, with a single to the wall in left-center field off [[Arizona Diamondbacks]] closer [[Jos<U+00E9> Valverde]] scoring Jos<U+00E9> Reyes from first base as the Mets defeated Arizona, 8&ndash;7. Wright also made a game-saving stop at 3rd base of a would-be game-tying single by [[Mike Lieberthal]] for the final out of a 4&ndash;3 Mets victory over Philadelphia on August 5.

Wright was voted on to his first MLB [[All-Star Game]] as the starting third baseman for the NL. During the 2006 season, Wright collected 74 RBI before the All-Star Break, breaking the Mets record previously held by Mike Piazza, who had 72 RBI in 2000. Wright also participated in the [[2006 in baseball|2006]] [[Home Run Derby]], reaching the final round but finishing second to [[Ryan Howard]] of the [[Philadelphia Phillies]]. He hit 22 home runs in the contest, including 16 in the first round, the third highest total in any one round in the history of the Home Run Derby.<ref name="SIHRDerby">{{cite web

Wright ranked among the club's top three hitters in all offensive categories for the 2006 Mets, who were the second most run-scoring team in the National League. Fans at [[Shea Stadium]] have routinely greeted Wright's performances with chants of "M-V-P, M-V-P." According to then teammate [[Tom Glavine]], "He's probably been our most clutch hitter over the first half of the season and he's certainly thrown his hat into the MVP talks."<ref name="MVPtalk">{{cite web

He is only the third player to reach this  milestone before his 25th birthday, and only the third Met to reach this milestone in club history, the other two being Howard Johnson and Darryl Strawberry.

Wright was awarded the 2007 [[Rawlings Gold Glove Award|Gold Glove]] and the Silver Slugger Award at third base. He also was fourth in the [[Major League Baseball Most Valuable Player Award|NL MVP]] voting receiving 182 votes.<ref>[http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/news/story?id=3120573 ESPN - Rollins, who spurred Phils into playoffs, wins MVP - MLB]</ref>
