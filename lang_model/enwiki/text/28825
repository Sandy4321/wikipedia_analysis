The '''Battle of Vrbanja bridge''' was an armed confrontation which occurred on 27 May 1995 between [[United Nations]] (UN) [[peacekeepers]] from the [[French Army]] and elements of the [[Army of the Republika Srpska]] (VRS), after the VRS took over French-manned [[United Nations Protection Force]] (UNPROFOR) [[observation post]]s on both ends of the [[Vrbanja bridge]] crossing of the [[Miljacka]] river in [[Sarajevo]], [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] during the [[Bosnian War]]. The VRS took the French peacekeepers hostage. A platoon of 30 French peacekeepers subsequently re-captured the bridge supported by another 70 French infantry and direct fire from armoured vehicles including [[ERC 90 Sagaie]] [[Armored car (military)|armoured cars]]. During the French assault, elements of the [[Army of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina]] (ARBiH) opened fire on the VRS-held observation posts, accidentally wounding one French hostage. Two French soldiers were killed during the assault and 10 were wounded. VRS casualties were four killed, three wounded and four captured. Following the battle, VRS forces were observed to be less likely to engage French UN peacekeepers deployed in the city.

==Background==
In March 1995, while [[NATO]] was planning a new strategy to support peacekeeping operations in [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], a ceasefire brokered by former US President [[Jimmy Carter]] between the [[Army of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina]] (ARBiH) and the [[Army of Republika Srpska]] (VRS) forces expired and, as predicted, fighting resumed. As the struggle gradually widened, the ARBiH launched a large-scale offensive in the area of Sarajevo. In response to this attack, the VRS seized heavy weapons from a UN-guarded depot, and began shelling targets around Sarajevo.<ref>{{cite book|title =Bombs over Bosnia: The Role of Airpower in Bosnia-Herzegovina |first =Michael | last = Beale| publisher = Air University Press | year =1997 |location = [[Maxwell Air Force Base]], Montgomery | oclc = 39892597|page=33}}</ref> In retaliation for these actions, the UN commander, [[Lieutenant-general (United Kingdom)|Lieutenant General]] [[Rupert Smith]] requested NATO air strikes. NATO responded on 25 and 26 May 1995 by bombing a VRS ammunition dump at [[Pale, Bosnia and Herzegovina|Pale]].<ref>[http://www.afsouth.nato.int/archives/operations/DenyFlight/DenyFlightFactSheet.htm Operation Deny Flight] AFSOUTH Fact sheets</ref> The mission was carried out by [[United States Air Force|USAF]] [[F-16]]s and [[Spanish Air Force]] [[McDonnell Douglas F/A-18 Hornet|EF-18]]As Hornets armed with [[laser-guided bomb]]s.<ref>{{cite book|title = Conflict in the Balkans, 1991-2000| first = Tim | last = Ripley | publisher = Osprey Publishing | year = 2001|isbn = 1-84176-290-3|location = London|page=23}}</ref> The Serbs then seized 377 UNPROFOR hostages and used them as [[human shield]]s for a variety of potential targets in Bosnia and Herzegovina, forcing NATO to end the air strikes.<ref>{{cite book| title =Responsibility of Command| last =  Bucknam | first = Mark | publisher =  Air University Press| year =  2003|isbn = 1-58566-115-5|oclc = 52199670 | location = Maxwell Air Force Base|page= 215}}</ref>

Facing a second hostage crisis, General Smith and other top UN commanders began to shift strategy. The UN began to redeploy its forces to more defensible locations, so that they would be harder to attack and so that it would be more difficult to take UN personnel hostage. General Rose, on the other hand, established the UN Rapid Reaction Force, a heavily-armed land unit with more aggressive rules of engagement, designed to take offensive action if necessary to prevent hostage-taking and enforce peace agreements.<ref>Bucknam, p. 216</ref>

Vrbanja bridge was in [[no-man's-land]], surrounded by tall buildings which made the location a target of [[sniper]]-fire from the beginning of the war.<ref name=toofar/> On 5 April 1992, six protestors including [[Suada Dilberovi<U+0107>]] and [[Olga Su<U+010D>i<U+0107>]] were shot on the bridge by Serb snipers, and are considered by [[Croats]] and Bosniaks to be the first victims at the beginning of the [[Siege of Sarajevo]].<ref name=bet>Schmidt, Bettina (2001) ''Anthropology of Violence and Conflict''.

==Battle==

===VRS attack===
On 27 May 1995 at 4:30 am,<ref name=toofar/> VRS soldiers posing as French troops captured the UN observation posts on both ends of the bridge without firing a shot. They wore French uniforms, flak jackets, helmets, and personal weapons and drove a French [[armoured personnel carrier]] (APC) - all stolen from UN troops detained outside the city. The Serbs disarmed the 12 peacekeepers on the bridge at gunpoint. Ten were taken to an unknown destination while two remained on the site as human shields.<ref name=indp/><ref name=LA/> According to [[Colonel]] Erik Sandahl, commander of the 4th French Battalion (FREBAT4) which was at that time provided by the [[3rd Marine Infantry Regiment]], "when the Serbs took our soldiers under their control by threat, by dirty tricks, they began to act as terrorists, you cannot support this. You must react. The moment comes when you have to stop it. Full stop. And we did."<ref name=toofar>[http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/the-day-the-serbs-went-a-bridge-too-far-1585305.html The day the Serbs went a bridge too far] by Emma Daly. [[The Independent]], 7 June 1995</ref>

===French reaction===
The first evidence that something was wrong at Vrbanja bridge was radio silence from the French post. Captain Francois Lecointre was sent to find out what was happening; he was met by a Serb sentry in French uniform who attempted to take him prisoner. Lecointre quickly turned around and drove to [[Skenderija]] stadium, the [[headquarters]] of FREBAT4.<ref name=toofar/>
[[File:Sarajevo Grbavica.JPG|thumb|left|The battle-damaged Sarajevo suburb of Grbavica near the Vrbanja bridge over the Miljacka river]]
The French responded by sending a platoon of 30 FREBAT4 troops to re-capture the northern end of the bridge, backed by another 70 French infantry, six [[ERC 90 Sagaie]] [[Armored car (military)|armored cars]] and several [[V<U+00E9>hicule de l'Avant Blind<U+00E9>|VAB]] APCs. The assault force was led by Lecointre, who approached the northern edge of the bridge following the usual route of the UN convoys. The French overran a [[Sangar (fortification)|sangar]] held by the VRS, at the cost of the life of [[Private (rank)|Private]] Jacki Humblot. The assault was supported by 90mm direct fire from the armoured cars and heavy machine-gun fire. The Serbs responded with [[Mortar (weapon)|mortar]] bombs and fire from [[Anti-aircraft warfare|anti-aircraft weapons]]. Five French were wounded in the clash, while four VRS soldiers were killed and four were taken prisoner.<ref name=toofar/> ARBiH snipers joined the fight, accidentally shooting and wounding one French hostage. At the conclusion of the 32 minute-long firefight, the VRS remained in control of the southern end of the bridge, while the French occupied the northern end.<ref name=indp>{{cite web| publisher= The Independent|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/french-humiliation-sparks-battle-of-vrbanja-bridge-1621353.html| author= | title=French humiliation sparks battle of Vrbanja| date= 28 May 1995| accessdate=31 December 2012}}</ref> The VRS then asked for a truce to recover their dead and wounded, under the threat of killing French hostages. The wounded French soldier was immediately released and evacuated to a UN hospital. The VRS eventually gave up and abandoned the southern end of the bridge. The last French soldier held as hostage, a corporal, managed to escape. The second French soldier to die in the battle, Private Marcel Amaru, was killed by a sniper while on a supporting mission in the [[Jewish]] cemetery of Sarajevo. The VRS soldiers captured in the action were treated as prisoners of war and detained at an UNPROFOR facility.<ref name=toofar/><ref name=LA>[http://articles.latimes.com/1995-05-28/news/mn-7017_1_french-peacekeepers Pitched Battles Erupt in Sarajevo : Bosnia: Rebel Serbs kill 3 French soldiers in deadliest clashes yet with peacekeepers.

==Aftermath==
According to the top French officers involving in the operation, the action on Vrbanja bridge showed the VRS that UNPROFOR's attitude had changed. [[Ranks_in_the_French_Army#Lieutenant-Colonel|Lieutenant Colonel]] Erik Roussel stated later that "since the incident, the Serbs are strangely quiet towards us."<ref name=toofar/> A memorial to the French soldiers killed in action was unveiled on 5 April 1996, along with a plaque commemorating Suada Dilberovi<U+0107> and Olga Su<U+010D>i<U+0107>.<ref>[http://ireland.newspaperarchive.com/indiana-gazette/1996-04-07/page-6/ Memorial held for first victim of war in Bosnia] by Samir Krilic.
