Warren encountered significant opposition from business interests. In August 2012, Rob Engstrom, political director for the [[United States Chamber of Commerce]], claimed that "no other candidate in 2012 represents a greater threat to free enterprise than Professor Warren."<ref>Noah Bierman, [http://www.boston.com/politicalintelligence/2012/08/15/chamber-calls-elizabeth-warren-country-greatest-threat-free-enterprise/C4xrPRfTegjrNS9Tw4WkZM/story.html US Chamber calls Elizabeth Warren threat to free enterprise] ''[[The Boston Globe]]'' August 15, 2012</ref> She nonetheless raised $39 million for her campaign, the most of any Senate candidate in 2012.<ref name="NYTNov8"/>

Warren received a primetime speaking slot at the [[2012 Democratic National Convention]], immediately before [[Bill Clinton]], on the evening of September 5, 2012. Warren positioned herself as a champion of a beleaguered middle class that "has been chipped, squeezed, and hammered." According to Warren, "People feel like the system is rigged against them. And here's the painful part: They're right. The system is rigged." Warren said that Wall Street CEOs "wrecked our economy and destroyed millions of jobs" and that they "still strut around congress, no shame, demanding favors, and acting like we should thank them."<ref>[http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/elizabeth-warren-democratic-national-convention-system-rigged/story?id=17150134 Elizabeth Warren: 'The System Is Rigged']</ref><ref>[http://go.bloomberg.com/political-capital/2012-09-05/elizabeth-warren-wall-street-ceos-still-strut-around-congress/ Elizabeth Warren: 'Wall Street CEOs' Still 'Strut Around Congress']</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Kirchgaessner|first=Stephanie|title=Warren attacks CEOs who <U+2018>wrecked economy<U+2019>|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/5718c926-f7d4-11e1-ba54-00144feabdc0.html|work=Financial Times|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20120908033052/http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/5718c926-f7d4-11e1-ba54-00144feabdc0.html|archivedate=September 8, 2012|date=September 6, 2012}}</ref>

At Warren's first Banking Committee hearing on February 14, 2013, she pressed several banking regulators to answer when they had last taken a Wall Street bank to trial and stated, "I'm really concerned that 'too big to fail' has become 'too big for trial.'" Videos of Warren's questioning became popular on the internet, amassing more than 1 million views in a matter of days.<ref>{{cite news|title=Senator Warren's rebuke of regulators goes viral|author=Lynch, S.

In May 2013, Warren introduced her first bill, the Bank on Student Loans Fairness Act, which would allow students to take out government education loans at the same rate that banks such as [[Goldman Sachs]] and [[J.P. Morgan Chase]] pay to borrow from the federal government. Suggesting that students should get "the same great deal that banks get," Warren proposed that new student borrowers be able to take out a federally subsidized loan at 0.75%, the rate paid by banks, compared with the current 3.4% student loan rate.<ref>{{cite news|title=Elizabeth Warren: Students Should Get the Same Rate as the Bankers|author=Webley, K.|url=http://business.time.com/2013/05/10/elizabeth-warren-students-should-get-the-same-rate-as-the-bankers/|newspaper=TIME Magazine|date=10 May 2013|accessdate=11 May 2013}}</ref> Endorsing her bill days after its introduction, [[Independent (politician)|Independent]] Senator from [[Vermont]] [[Bernie Sanders]] stated: "the only thing wrong with this bill is that [she] thought of it and I didn<U+2019>t" on [[Thom Hartmann|The Thom Hartmann Program]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sanders.senate.gov/newsroom/news/?id=C959DC0B-7D8C-4AAE-8FBF-DF74791B8A26|title=Student Loans|author=[[Bernie Sanders]]|publisher=[[United States Senate]]|date=May 17, 2013|accessdate=18 May 2013}}</ref>

Warren and her daughter Amelia Tyagi wrote ''The Two-Income Trap: Why Middle-Class Mothers and Fathers Are Going Broke''. Warren and Tyagi point out that a fully employed worker today earns less inflation-adjusted income than a fully employed worker did 30 years ago. Although families spend less today on clothing, appliances, and other consumption, the costs of core expenses such as mortgages, health care, transportation, and child care have increased dramatically. The result is, that even with two income-earners, families are no longer able to save and they have incurred greater and greater debt.<ref>{{cite book|last=Warren|first=Elizabeth|title=All Your Worth: The Ultimate Lifetime Money Plan|year=2005|publisher=Free Press|isbn=978-0-7432-6987-2|author2=Amelia Warren Tyagi|accessdate=16 September 2012|pages=1<U+2013>12}}</ref>

In an article in ''[[The New York Times]]'', [[Jeff Madrick]] said of Warren's book:
{{quote| The authors find that it is not the free-spending young or the incapacitated elderly who are declaring bankruptcy so much as families with children&nbsp;... their main thesis is undeniable. Typical families often cannot afford the high-quality education, health care, and neighborhoods required to be middle class today.
