The '''Poitevin''', also called '''Mulassier''' ("mule-breeder"),<ref name="Bongianni">{{cite book| last = Bongianni| first = Maurizio| title = Simon & Schuster's Guide to Horses and Ponies | publisher = Simon & Schuster, Inc | year = 1988 | page = 9 | isbn = 0-671-66068-3}}</ref> '''Poitevin Mulassier''' or '''Trait Mulassier''' is a [[draft horse]] from the [[Poitou]] area of [[France]]. It is a late-maturing breed with strong bones, known for its calm nature. It is found in many solid [[equine coat color|coat colors]], the result of [[crossbreed]]ing with several other European draft breeds throughout its history, and is the only French draft horse to be found in [[bay dun]]. Today, Poitevins are used mainly for [[driving (horse)|driving]], although some are used for riding and [[equine therapy]]. 

Enthusiasts claim descent from the horses painted on the cave walls of [[Lascaux]], though this has not been verified by scientific studies. Horses have been recorded in the area since at least the 10th century, and the regional type was preferred by [[magistrate]]s and clergy in [[medieval]] times. The Poitevin breed as it is known today began to take shape in the early 17th century, as engineers began draining the French marshes and brought with them their draft horses, which were crossed with native horses. Since early in its history, the Poitevin has been used extensively for the breeding of [[mule]]s, and although commonly called a draft horse, was not favored for agricultural purposes. During the 19th century, the population of the Poitevin increased, reaching 50,000 pure and crossbred mares by 1867. Crossbreeding with other draft breeds led to concerns about the purity of the Poitevin population, but a small group of breeders worked to preserve the remaining purebred population. 

A [[studbook]] was created for the breed in 1884, and was [[closed stud book|closed]] in 1922. A breeders' association was created in 1923. The first half of the 20th century saw declining populations of horses and mules due to increased [[mechanization]], and, by 1945, Poitevin breeding was oriented towards the production of [[horse meat|meat]]. The population dropped precipitously, and between 1970 and 1990 varied between 250 and 300 animals, with still lower levels seen in the early 1990s. A genetic study released in 1994 showed [[genetic bottleneck]]ing and a severe risk of [[inbreeding]], and led to the establishment of a [[conservation biology|conservation plan]]. Despite a slight increase in popularity at the beginning of the 21st century, the Poitevin is still in danger of extinction, with a slightly downward-trending population.

==Characteristics==

The chest is broad and deep, the [[withers]] prominent, the back long and broad,<ref name="studbook"/> and the hindquarters strong. The legs are well developed and powerful,<ref name=Fugain/> with large joints.<ref name="studbook"/> The Poitevin has large hooves, an advantage in wet environments, as an adaptation to the alternately hard and waterlogged marshes upon which it developed.<ref name="HN"/> The lower legs are well [[feathering (horse)|feathered]],<ref name=Bat178/> and the mane and tail are long and thick.<ref name=Fugain/><ref>Bataille, 2008, p. 177</ref> The Poitevin is gentle, calm<ref name=Fugain/> and robust.<ref name=Col125/> Historically the breed has been known for its slow movement and disinterest in pulling, although it can produce significant power if necessary.<ref name=Bit17>Biteau, 1997, p. 17</ref> The breed enjoys human contact, and shows intelligence, although it can also be stubborn. Prolonged effort is its weak point, as the Poitevin sometimes lack endurance.<ref name=Fugain/>

The Poitevin is found in a wide variety of [[equine coat color|colors]], which are partly the result of the many breeds that influenced it.<ref name=Bat178/> It is the only French draft horse that can be found in  [[bay dun]],<ref name=Fugain/> a tan body color with black mane and tail and [[primitive markings]]. This color likely comes from the Spanish horses that influenced the Flemish horses that later contributed to the breeding of the Poitevin.<ref name=Bat178/> The most popular colors are pure [[black (horse)|black]] and [[seal brown (horse)|seal brown]] (the latter called black pangar<U+00E9> by the breed registry, although these horses are genetically brown, not  black with [[pangar<U+00E9>]] markings),<ref name=Fugain/> which came from the influence of Flemish and [[Friesian horse]]s.<ref name=Bat178/> The breed standard accepts all colors, except for [[pinto]] and [[leopard complex|leopard spotted]],<ref name="MulasPoitou"/> and it is common to see [[gray (horse)|gray]], [[bay (horse)|bay]] and [[roan (horse)|bay roan]] horses, the last probably being inherited from the [[Brabant (horse)|Brabant]] breed.<ref name=Bat178/> [[Chestnut (coat)|Chestnut]] and [[roan (horse)|chestnut roan]] are also seen,<ref name=Col125/> both being a legacy of [[Breton horse|Breton]] crosses in the breed.<ref name=Bat178/>

==History==
The Poitevin breed was created in the marshes of the [[Poitou]] region,<ref name="History">{{cite web|url=http://www.chevalpoitevin.com/Page/ArticleViewer.aspx?Id=13|title=Historique de la race Poitevin|language=French|publisher=Association du Cheval Poitevin|accessdate=2013-02-07}}</ref> especially around [[Lu<U+00E7>on]], [[La Rochelle]], [[Melle, Deux-S<U+00E8>vres|Melle]] and [[Niort]].<ref name=Bix396>Bixio, 1844, p. 396</ref> It was developed through a mixture of human and [[natural selection]] to the marshy area that it inhabited. Although described as a draft horse, it was not selected for draft purposes, and was never popular for that use.<ref name=Bat176>Bataille, 2008, p. 176</ref>

[[File:Friesian Stallion.jpg|thumb|left|A Friesian, one of the breeds that contributed to the Poitevin]]
Remains of prehistoric horses have been found in the Poitou region, with [[Mesolithic]] remains (20,000 to 5,000 BC) located near [[Surgeres]] and [[Echire]]. Some enthusiasts claim that the Poitevin horse is descended directly from these horses, based on physical similarities, and claim a common origin with the [[Tarpan]] horse painted on the [[Lascaux|Lascaux cave walls]]. However, this has not been confirmed by scientific studies, and numerous claims by other horse breeds of this same relationship have been invalidated by further research.<ref name="MulasPoitou">{{cite web|url=http://www.racesmulassieresdupoitou.com/trait-poitevin-mulassier/|title=Trait Poitevin Mulassier|publisher=Races mulassi<U+00E8>res du Poitou|language=French|accessdate=2013-02-05}}</ref> Other horses were probably brought to the area by migrating [[Celts]], and there is a record from the 10th century of a bishop from [[Rome]] asking the [[Count of Poitou]] for a [[mare]] from the region. These horses, like [[mule]]s, were a favorite among the [[magistrate]]s and [[ecclesiastical]] personnel in the [[medieval]] era, and were sold around Niort, [[Saint-Maixent]], [[Auvergne (province)|Auvergne]], [[Dauphin<U+00E9>|Dauphine]], [[Languedoc]] and in Spain.<ref name=Col123>Collective, p. 123</ref> The number of horses in the area, however, was not well known before the 17th century.<ref name=Bit>Biteau, 1997, pp. 14<U+2013>16</ref> 

The Poitevin breed as it is known today began to develop in 1599 when King [[Henry IV of France]]<ref name="HN">{{cite web|url=http://www.haras-nationaux.fr/portail/uploads/tx_dlcubehnshop/trait_poitevin_01.pdf|title=Fiche du Poitevin Mulassier|language=French|publisher=Haras Nationaux|accessdate=2013-02-07}}</ref> requested that Dutch and Flemish engineers, led by [[Humphrey Bradley]], begin draining the Poitou marshes.<ref name="MulasPoitou"/> They brought with them Friesian, Brabant and a type of Flemish work horse that was well known in the 13th century.<ref>Mavr<U+00E9>, 2004, p. 40</ref> These horses stood under {{hands|16.3|lk=off}} and weighed up to {{convert|1200|kg|lbs}}.<ref name=Bit/> They were crossed with native Poitou mares,<ref name="History"/><ref name=Dal30>Dal'Secco, 2006, pp. 30<U+2013>31</ref> and this crossbreeding created a large, slow type,<ref name=Bat176/> similar to the Flemish work horses of the Dutch marshes.<ref name=Bit/><ref>Bixio, 1844, pp. 395<U+2013>396</ref> This type was the forerunner of the modern Poitevin breed.<ref name="HN"/><ref name=Col123/>

At the end of the 18th century, the French government tried to impose a system of crossing Poitevin horses with lighter-weight [[Norman horse|Norman]] and [[Thoroughbred]] horses to create [[cavalry]] horses. Despite financial incentives,<ref name="MulasPoitou"/> private breeders protested because they felt that the resulting crossbred horses created poor quality mules upon further breeding. The changes also affected the characteristics of the breed that had been developed for work in its marshy homeland,<ref name=Bit/> including large hooves and a calm manner. Some sources argue that at this point the breed was employed for agricultural and logging uses.<ref name=Col123/><ref name=Dal30/> Others state that they were not pulling horses, and were instead used almost solely for the production of mules.<ref name=Bat176/>

===Production of mules===
Poitevin mares were crossbred with [[Poitou donkey]]s to create the famous [[Poitou mule]], a large, hardy breed. As mules are [[hybrid (biology)|hybrid]]s, and thus [[sterility (physiology)|sterile]], they can only be created through crossing a donkey and a horse.<ref name=Mav28>Mavr<U+00E9>, 2004, p. 28</ref> The industry of mule breeding in Poitou has existed since at least the 18th century, when it was opposed by the government [[stud farm]] administration that was attempting to breed cavalry horses for French troops. At the beginning of the 19th century, the government prohibited breeding mules from mares taller than {{hands|11.3+1/4|lk=off}}, and threatened to [[castrate]] all donkeys in the region.<ref name=Bit/> In the 1860s, equine historian [[Eugene Gayot]] described a horse that he called the "''poitevine mulassi<U+00E8>re''", and stated that the main purpose of this breed was to produce mares from which to breed mules. He added that this breed was also called the Poitevin. Mares of many breeds were used to produce mules at that point in history, but Gayot noted that the heavy mares from the Poitou marshes produced the best mules,<ref name=Moll>Moll, Nicolas and Gayot, 1861</ref> likely because the Poitevin mares bequeathed to their descendents the same heavy bone structure.<ref name=Bat178>Bataille, 2008, p. 178</ref>

Although the Poitevin was not the only breed of horse used for the production of mules, the Poitou mule was known worldwide.<ref name=Gay1860>{{cite journal|title=L'industrie mulassi<U+00E8>re en Poitou|author=Gayot, Eug<U+00E8>ne|journal=Journal d'agriculture pratique|volume=2|year=1860|url=http://books.google.com/?id=wURAAAAAcAAJ&dq=Poitevin+mulassier|language=French|pages=67<U+2013>71}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|author=Rousseaux, <U+00C9>ric|title=Le baudet du Poitou, le trait poitevin mulassier et la mule poitevine: les acteurs d'une industrie mulassi<U+00E8>re autrefois r<U+00E9>put<U+00E9>e dans le monde entier|publisher=Geste <U+00E9>d|year=2011|isbn=2-84561-850-6|at=Cover}}</ref> They were in high demand in the United States from the late 19th century until the beginning of World War I.<ref name=Mav28/> During the 1920s, livestock production began to decline.<ref>Biteau, 1997, p. 2</ref> In the [[Deux-Sevres]] region, especially in the district of Melle, near [[Lu<U+00E7>on]] and [[Saint-Maixent]], mule breeding began to be concentrated in ''ateliers'' (workshops), which were relatively expensive for breeders.<ref name=Mav28/><ref name=Gay1860/>

===19th century===
Poitevin [[colt (horse)|colt]]s and [[filly|fillies]] were sold at fairs in [[Marans, Charente-Maritime|Marans]], [[Nuaille]], [[Surgeres]], [[Rochefort, Charente-Maritime|Rochefort]], [[Pont l'Abbe]] and [[Saujon]].<ref name=Bix396/> In 1867, there were 50,000 pure and crossbred mares.<ref name=Bit18>Biteau, 1997, p. 18</ref>  By the early 20th century, there were tens of thousands of Poitevins in France,<ref name=Col125>Collective, p. 125</ref> but this period saw the beginning of the breed's decline.<ref name=Bit18/> Poitevin colts, which were not used for the breeding of mules, were considered "soft" and less valuable than the major draft horse breed of the 19th century <U+2013> the [[Percheron]]. Some horse dealers purchased young gray Poitevin horses, fed them heavily to make them larger and stronger, and then sold them at the age of four as Percherons. These "Percherons" were transported to areas such as [[Saintonge]], [[Yonne]], [[Nivernais]] and [[Gatinais]].<ref>{{cite book|chapter=Chevaux de la Vend<U+00E9>e et du Poitou|title=Le livre de la ferme et des maisons de campagne|language=French|author=Joigneaux, Pierre|publisher=Masson|year=1863|url=http://books.google.com/?id=lGo7Yj0VxPAC&pg=PA533&dq=Poitevin+mulassier#v=onepage&q=Poitevin%20mulassier&f=false}}</ref>

[[File:<U+00C9>talon mulassier.jpg|thumb|left|An 1877 illustration of a Poitevin]]
In the early 19th century, the breed was crossed with the Percheron, and with the [[Boulonnais horse|Boulonnais]] between 1860 and 1867. During the same time period, crosses were made with the Breton, a practice supported by some breeders and denounced by others.<ref name="MulasPoitou"/> Farmers in the region also began to add Breton blood into the Poitou mule,<ref name=Bix396/> giving that animal a more square head and shorter ears.<ref name=Gay1860/><ref name=Moll561>Moll, Nicolas and Gayot, 1861, pp.&nbsp;561<U+2013>62</ref> In the Poitevin horse breed, the crosses resulted in the body becoming longer and lighter, the legs longer and with less bone, and gray becoming more common as a coat color.<ref name=Moll561/> In 1860, Eugene Gayot called the mares of the breed "heavy, common, soft and of medium size".<ref name=Gay1860/> Breeders chose horses with large joints, thick coats<ref name=Gay1860/> and a high [[rump (animal)|croup]], and had a preference for a black coat color.<ref name=Bix396/>

In 1861, there were concerns that the old-style Poitevin was becoming extinct, and questions about whether the Poitou mule retained the quality that it previously had.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Gayot, Eug<U+00E8>ne|language=French|title=De la f<U+00E9>condit<U+00E9> chez la jument livr<U+00E9>e <U+00E0> la production du mulet|journal=Journal d'agriculture pratique|volume=25
|year=1861|url=http://books.google.com/?id=2hghAQAAIAAJ&dq=Poitevin+mulassier|issue=2}}</ref> The large Poitevin mares became rarer, due to large amounts of crossbreeding and a lack of care shown towards [[breeding stock]] selection.<ref name=Bit/> Thoroughbreds and Thoroughbred crosses, especially at the stud farms in [[St. Maixent]] and [[La Roche-sur-Yon]], created the Anglo-Poitevin type, a half-blood used by the army. The continued draining of the marshes also influenced the breed.<ref name=Moll/> Many Poitevins at this point were actually a mix of Breton and old-type Poitevin bloodstock. However, a distinction persisted between the real Poitevin and mixed-blood horses, and farmers who preferred the former preserved the type, which formed the base for the creation of the breed [[studbook]].<ref name=Bit/>

[[File:AngloPoitevine.jpg|thumb|right|An 1861 illustration of an Anglo-Poitevin]]
The studbook for the Poitevin horse was created by the ''Soci<U+00E9>t<U+00E9> Centrale d'Agriculture des Deux-S<U+00E8>vres'' on June 26, 1884,<ref name=Mav44>Mavr<U+00E9>, 2004, p. 44</ref> with a horse section and a donkey section.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.chevalmag.com/chevalmag/Actualites/Divers/Les-125-ans-des-stud-books-des-races-mulassieres-du-Poitou|title=Les 125 ans des stud-books des races mulassi<U+00E8>res du Poitou|journal=Cheval magazine|accessdate=2013-02-07|language=French}}</ref> The first edition was released December 31, 1885,<ref name=Mav44/> setting the physical criteria for the breeding and ending the practice of promoting crossbred horses as purebreds. It also marked the end of government intervention against the mule breeding industry, although bonuses were paid to encourage farmers to breed purebred horses.<ref name=Bit/> In 1902, a breeding syndicate to promote Poitou mules was created, but disappeared after a lack of advertising by stock breeders. On August 6, 1912, the French government released a decree officially supporting the mule breeding industry, backed by the purchase of mules by the [[French National Stud]] and bonuses given to the best stallions.<ref>Biteau, 1997, pp. 16, 23</ref>

===20th century===
After several revisions, the studbook was [[closed stud book|closed]] in 1922 after registering 424 [[foundation stock|foundation]] horses. The closing of the studbook brought about additional purebred breeding and selection based on conformation, color and working ability.<ref name=Bit/> In 1923, an association of Poitevin breeders was founded,<ref name=Col125/> but declining livestock production pushed the group to reorganize in 1937 in order to gain more support from the government, through bonuses and subsidies.<ref name=Bit/>

In the first half of the 20th century, the mule breeding industry collapsed with the advent of mechanization.<ref name=Col125/> By 1922, Poitevin foals became difficult to sell,<ref name=Bit18/> and the population dropped dramatically as there was no economic incentive for breeding. A continued breeding of mules caused the breed to decline faster than other draft breeds, as purebred horses were not bred as often.<ref name=Col125/><ref name=Dal30/> By 1945, breed selection was oriented towards the production of [[horse meat|meat]], as the only remaining economic opportunity for farmers.<ref name=Bit/> The conformation of the breed changed slightly to become shorter, but the Poitevin remained unprofitable for horse meat, as breeders preferred to invest in herds of [[Comtois]] and Breton horses, which were faster growing and higher yielding.<ref name=Bit18/>

By 1950, there were only about 600 mares and 50 stallion left in the breed. Increasing mechanization and competition with other livestock hurt the Poitevin,<ref name=Bit18/> as did a lack of promotion and protection. Between 1970 and 1990, the population of the Poitevin varied between 250 and 300 animals, with an average of 20 new horses entering the studbook each year.<ref>Biteau, 1997, pp. 19<U+2013>20</ref> By the early 1990s, population numbers fell to the lowest in history.<ref name="MulasPoitou"/><ref name=Bat179>Bataille, 2008, p. 179</ref> Sources are unclear on the number of living Poitevins in the early 1990s, but by 1996 one author says there were 64 newly registered foals and 28 approved breeding stallions,<ref name=Dohner>{{cite book |author=Dohner, Janet Vorwald |title=The Encyclopedia of Historic and Endangered Livestock and Poultry Breeds |publisher=Yale University Press |location=New Haven, CT |year=2001 |isbn=0-300-08880-9|page=390|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=WJCTL_mC5w4C&pg=PA391}}</ref> while another gives a total population of 293 horses in 1997.<ref>Biteau, 1997, p. 20</ref>

===Conservation and genetic testing===
The breed owes its survival to a small group of enthusiasts, working with the French National Stud.<ref name=Col125/><ref name=Dal30/> A genetic study performed in 1994 revealed a [[genetic bottleneck]] in the mid-1900s, with the entire modern population of Poitevins tracing to one stallion, named Qu<U+00E9>bec, foaled in 1960. There is a significant risk of [[inbreeding]], leading the ''Unit<U+00E9> Nationale de S<U+00E9>lection et de Promotion de Race'' to promote a plan of managed breeding in 1998.<ref name=Dal30/> At the same time, crossbreeding with Friesian and [[Belgian horse|Belgian]] horses was suggested to increase [[genetic diversity]] using [[morphology (biology)|morphologically]] and historically similar breeds.<ref name=Col125/> The French government distributes bonuses to the owners of the best stallions, a program more important to the Poitevin than to other draft breeds because of the significant possibility of extinction.<ref name=Bit23>Biteau, 1997, p. 23</ref> 

The Poitevin had a slight increase in popularity at the beginning of the 21st century,<ref name=Col125/> and could count approximately 100 farms perpetuating the breed.<ref name=Mav28/> The association had around 300 members, as well as 83 stallions and 189 mares registered.<ref name=Col125/> However, by 2006, the Poitevin was still considered the most endangered French horse breed, with less than 100 births per year<ref name=Dal30/> and a slightly decreasing population.<ref name=Bat180>Bataille, 2008, p. 180</ref> There is almost no crossbreeding done with outside breeds, in order to maintain the numbers of purebred stock.<ref name=Dal30/> In 2008, a second genetic study was conducted in partnership with the [[Institut National de la Recherche Agronomique]]; this study considered the Poitevin and four other French breeds to be endangered. It suggested making these breeds a [[conservation biology|conservation]] priority in order to maintain maximum genetic diversity among the French horse population.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Leroy, Gr<U+00E9>goire; Call<U+00E8>de, Lucille; Verrier, Etienne; M<U+00E9>riaux, Jean-Claude; Ricard, Anne; Danchin-Burge, Coralie; Rognon, Xavier|date=January 5, 2009|title=Genetic diversity of a large set of horse breeds raised in France assessed by microsatellite polymorphism|journal=Genetics Selection Evolution|volume=41|url=http://www.gsejournal.org/content/41/1/5|accessdate=2013-02-07|issue=5|doi=10.1186/1297-9686-41-5|pages=5}}</ref>

The studbook for the Poitevin is based in Niort,<ref name=Bit23/> and the breed is the subject of a conservation breeding plan, the goal of which is to eventually revive the production of Poitou mules. The conservation plan includes an experimental infusion of blood from the Boulonnais, and is followed by 70 percent of breeders.<ref name=Bat180/> ''L'association nationale des races mulassi<U+00E8>res du Poitou'' manages the studbook for the Poitevin horse, the Poitou donkey and the Poitou mule, and is recognized by the [[French Ministry of Agriculture]]. Its goals are to ensure the selection of breeding stock that meet the physical characteristics expected of the breeds, to maintain the studbooks, and to promote the breeds.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.racesmulassieresdupoitou.com/association-races-mulassieres-poitou/|title=Association Races Mulassi<U+00E8>res Poitou |publisher=Association nationale des races mulassi<U+00E8>res du Poitou|language=French|accessdate=2013-02-08}}</ref> There is a [[breed show]] held annually in the Poitou region.<ref name=Col125/>

The Poitevin breed has very low numbers. In 2011, there were 71 new foals registered with the studbook. The same year, 227 mares were [[mating|covered]], with 171 being bred to Poitevin stallions. There were 33 stallions registered and 80 active breeders. These numbers represent a decrease from the previous year.

Breeders in the US have become interested in the conservation of the breed as a draft animal, as opposed to many Europeans, who are looking for a leisure animal.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Les traits fran<U+00E7>ais dans le monde|author=Pilley-Mirande, Nathalie|journal=Cheval magazine|date=October 2002|pages=62<U+2013>65|issue=371|language=French}}</ref> A stud farm also exists in Sweden, and one in the United States.<ref name="MulasPoitou"/>

==Uses==
As the stallions of the Poitevin breed could not be used to produce mules, they were generally sold as two-year-olds at the summer fair in Vendee and the winter fair in Saint-Maixent, as well as to horse merchants in [[Berry]], [[Beauce]], [[Perche]] and [[Midi]]. In these areas, they were used for agriculture. In Paris, they were used for pulling [[Bus|omnibuses]], and the French military used the Poitevin for pulling artillery.<ref name=Moll561/> At the beginning of the 21st century there has been a new demand for mules for leisure purposes, but this demand cannot be filled by Poitevin mares until their numbers have recovered to a sufficient level.<ref name=Bat179/> 

Today, Poitevins are used mainly for [[driving (horse)|driving]], both in competitions and for leisure use.<ref name="HN"/><ref name=Col125/> They are used to pull carriages for tourists. Members of the breed can be ridden more comfortably than other draft breeds due to their slimmer build.<ref name="MulasPoitou"/> They are also used extensively for [[equine therapy]] in France.<ref name="utilispoitevin"/> The Poitevin is used for light agricultural work in [[vineyard]]s,<ref name="utilispoitevin">{{cite web|url=http://www.chevalpoitevin.com/Page/ArticleViewer.aspx?Id=28|title=Utilisation du cheval |language=French|publisher=Association du Cheval Poitevin|accessdate=2013-02-08}}</ref> and for maintenance of natural [[wetland]]s. The council of [[Ille-et-Vilaine]] acquired a herd of Poitevins to maintain the marshes in the area.<ref name="MulasPoitou"/> The Poitevin also has been used in movies,<ref>{{cite book|author=Racic-Hamitouche, Fran<U+00E7>oise and Ribaud, Sophie|title=Cheval et <U+00E9>quitation|language=French|publisher=<U+00C9>ditions Artemis|year=2007|isbn=2-84416-468-4|page=252}}</ref> as a mount for forest monitors in [[Melun]],<ref name=Fugain/> harnessed for urban work in Poitier and Niort,<ref name="MulasPoitou"/> and for the collection of waste on the island of [[<U+00CE>le de R<U+00E9>|Re]].<ref>{{cite journal|language=French|author=Huet, Anne-Claire|title=Sur l'<U+00EE>le de R<U+00E9>, Rodin ramasse les d<U+00E9>chets|journal=Aujourd'hui en France|date=September 10, 2011|page=15}}</ref>
