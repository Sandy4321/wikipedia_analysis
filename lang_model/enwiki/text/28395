The '''Battles of Lexington and Concord''' were the first military engagements of the [[American Revolutionary War]].<ref>A controversial interpretation holds that the [[Battle of Point Pleasant]], six months earlier, was the initial military engagement of the Revolutionary War.  Despite a 1908 United States Senate resolution designating it as such, few, if any, historians subscribe to this interpretation.[http://www.wvculture.org/history/journal_wvh/wvh56-5.html]</ref> They were fought on April 19, 1775, in [[Middlesex County, Massachusetts|Middlesex County]], [[Province of Massachusetts Bay]], within the towns of [[Lexington, Massachusetts|Lexington]], [[Concord, Massachusetts|Concord]], [[Lincoln, Massachusetts|Lincoln]], [[Arlington, Massachusetts|Menotomy (present-day Arlington)]], and [[Cambridge, Massachusetts|Cambridge]], near [[Boston]]. The battles marked the outbreak of open [[war|armed conflict]] between the [[Kingdom of Great Britain]] and its [[thirteen colonies]] in the mainland of [[British North America]].

About 700 [[British Army]] [[regulars]], under [[Lieutenant Colonel]] [[Francis Smith (British officer)|Francis Smith]], were given secret orders to capture and destroy military supplies that were reportedly stored by the Massachusetts [[militia]] at Concord. Through effective [[Military espionage|intelligence gathering]], [[Patriot (American Revolution)|Patriot]] colonials had received word weeks before the expedition that their supplies were at risk, and had moved most of them to safety. They also received details about British plans on the night before the battle, and were able to [[Paul Revere#The Midnight Ride of Paul Revere|rapidly notify]] the area militias of the military movement.

The first shots were fired just as the sun was rising at Lexington. The militia were outnumbered and fell back, and the regulars proceeded on to Concord, where they searched for the supplies.  At the [[Old North Bridge, Concord, Massachusetts|North Bridge in Concord]], several hundred militiamen fought and defeated three companies of the King's troops. The outnumbered regulars fell back from the [[Minutemen (militia)|Minutemen]] after a [[pitched battle]] in open territory.

More Minutemen arrived soon thereafter and inflicted heavy damage on the regulars as they marched back towards Boston. Upon returning to Lexington, Smith's expedition was rescued by reinforcements under [[Hugh Percy, 2nd Duke of Northumberland|Earl Hugh Percy]]. A combined force of fewer than 1,700 men marched back to Boston under heavy fire in a [[withdrawal (military)|tactical withdrawal]] and eventually reached the safety of [[Charlestown, Massachusetts|Charlestown]].  The accumulated militias blockaded the narrow land accesses to Charlestown and Boston, starting the [[Siege of Boston]].

[[Ralph Waldo Emerson]], in his ''[[Concord Hymn]]'' described the first shot fired by the Patriots at the North Bridge as the "[[shot heard 'round the world]]".<ref name="ConcordHymn">[[#Emerson|Emerson's Concord Hymn]]</ref>

==Background==
[[Image:Thomas Gage.jpg|thumb|left|[[Thomas Gage]]]]
{{further|[[Minutemen (militia)|Minutemen]] and [[British Forces in Boston (Winter 1774-1775)]]}}

The [[Great Britain|British]] Army's infantry, nicknamed "[[Red coat (British army)|redcoats]]" or "lobsterbacks" and sometimes "devils" by the colonists, had [[military occupation|occupied]] Boston since 1768 and had been augmented by [[Royal Navy|naval forces]] and [[Royal Marines|marines]] to enforce the [[Intolerable Acts]], which had been passed by [[Parliament of Great Britain|the British Parliament]] to punish the [[Massachusetts Bay Colony]] for the [[Boston Tea Party]] and other acts of protest. General [[Thomas Gage]], the military [[governor of Massachusetts]] and commander-in-chief of the roughly 3000 British military forces in Boston, had no control over Massachusetts outside of Boston, where implementation of the Acts had increased tensions between the [[Patriot (American Revolution)|Patriot (Whig)]] majority and the [[Loyalist (American Revolution)|Loyalist (Tory)]] minority. Gage's plan was to avoid conflict by removing military supplies from the Whig militias using small, secret and rapid strikes. This struggle for supplies led to one British success and then to several Patriot successes in a series of nearly bloodless conflicts known as the [[Powder Alarm]]s. Gage considered himself to be a friend of liberty and attempted to separate his duties as Governor of the colony and as General of an occupying force.  [[Edmund Burke]] described Gage's conflicted relationship with Massachusetts by saying in [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]], "An Englishman is the unfittest person on Earth to argue another [[Englishman]] into slavery."<ref name="Fischer30">[[#Fischer|Fischer]], p. 30</ref>

The colonists had been forming militias of various sorts since the 17th century, at first primarily for defense against [[Native Americans in the United States|local native]] attacks.  These forces were also called to action in the [[French and Indian War]] in the 1750s and 1760s.  They were generally local militias, nominally under the jurisdiction of the provincial government.<ref name="Brooks30">[[#Brooks|Brooks]], pp. 30-31</ref>  When the political situation began to deteriorate, in particular when Gage effectively dissolved the Provincial government under the terms of the [[Massachusetts Government Act]], these existing connections were put to use by the colonists under the [[Massachusetts Provincial Congress]] for the purpose of resistance to the perceived military threat.<ref name="Fischer51">[[#Fischer|Fischer]], p. 51</ref>

These battles are generally described as the opening battles of the [[American Revolutionary War]].

===Dartmouth's instructions and Gage's orders===
[[Image:Francis Smith.jpeg|frame|right|[[Francis Smith]], commander of the military expedition, in 1763]]
On April 14, 1775, Gage received instructions from [[Secretary of State]] [[William Legge, 2nd Earl of Dartmouth|William Legge, the Earl of Dartmouth]] to disarm the rebels, who were known to have hidden weapons in Concord, and to imprison the rebellion's leaders.  Dartmouth gave Gage considerable discretion in his commands.<ref name="Fischer7576">[[#Fischer|Fischer]], pp. 75-76</ref><ref name="Brooks37">[[#Brooks|Brooks]], pp. 37-38</ref>

On the morning of April 18, Gage ordered a mounted patrol of about 20 men under the command of Major Mitchell of the 5th Regiment into the surrounding country to intercept messengers who might be out on horseback.<ref>[[#Fischer|Fischer]], p. 89</ref>  This patrol behaved differently from patrols sent out from Boston in the past, staying out after dark and asking travelers about the location of [[Samuel Adams]] and [[John Hancock]]. This had the unintended effect of alarming many residents and increasing their preparedness.  The Lexington militia in particular began to muster early that evening, hours before receiving any word from Boston.  A well known story alleges that after nightfall one farmer, Josiah Nelson, mistook the British patrol for the colonists and asked them, "Have you heard anything about when the regulars are coming out?", upon which he was slashed on his scalp with a sword. However, the story of this incident was not published until over a century later, which suggests that it may be little more than a family myth.<ref>[[#Hafner|Hafner]] discusses this incident in detail.</ref>

Lieutenant Colonel Francis Smith received orders from Gage on the afternoon of April 18 with instructions that he was not to read them until his troops were underway.  They were to proceed from Boston "with utmost expedition and [[Military secret|secrecy]] to Concord, where you will seize and destroy<U+2026> all Military stores<U+2026> But you will take care that the soldiers do not plunder the inhabitants or hurt private property."  Gage used his discretion and did not issue written orders for the arrest of rebel leaders, as he feared doing so might spark an uprising.<ref name="Fischer85">[[#Fischer|Fischer]], p. 85</ref>

===Successful Colonial intelligence===
The rebellion's ringleaders &ndash; with the exception of [[Paul Revere]] and [[Joseph Warren]] &ndash; had all left Boston by April 8.  They had received word of Dartmouth's secret instructions to General Gage from sources in [[London]] long before they had reached Gage himself.<ref name="TourtellotIntel">[[#Tourtellot|Tourtellot]], pp. 71-72 (colonists have intelligence in late March) &amp; p. 87 (Gage receives instructions April 16)</ref>  Adams and Hancock had fled Boston to the [[Hancock-Clarke House]] in Lexington, home of one of Hancock's relatives, where they thought they would be safe from the immediate threat of arrest.<ref name="Tourtellot70">[[#Tourtellot|Tourtellot]], p. 70</ref>

[[Image:Margaret Kemble Gage.jpg|thumb|right|[[Margaret Kemble Gage]], who may have given the leaders of the rebellion military intelligence]]

The Massachusetts militias had indeed been gathering a stock of weapons, powder, and supplies at Concord, as well as an even greater amount much further west in [[Worcester, Massachusetts|Worcester]], but word reached the rebel leaders that British officers had been observed examining the roads to Concord.<ref name="Fischer8085">[[#Fischer|Fischer]], pp. 80-85</ref>  On April 8, Paul Revere rode to Concord to warn the inhabitants that the British appeared to be planning an expedition.  The townspeople decided to remove the stores and distribute them among other towns nearby.<ref name="Fischer87">[[#Fischer|Fischer]], p. 87</ref>

The colonists were also aware of the upcoming mission on April 19, despite it having been hidden from all the British rank and file and even from all the officers on the mission.  There is reasonable speculation, although not proven, that the confidential source of this intelligence was [[Margaret Gage]], General Gage's [[New Jersey]]-born wife, who had sympathies with the Colonial cause and a friendly relationship with Warren.<ref name="Fischer96"/>

Between 9:00 and 10:00 p.m on the night of April 18, 1775, Joseph Warren told [[William Dawes]] and [[Paul Revere]] that the [[George III of the United Kingdom|King's]] troops were about to embark in boats from Boston bound for Cambridge and the road to Lexington and Concord.  Warren's intelligence suggested that the most likely objectives of the regulars' movements later that night would be the capture of Adams and Hancock.  They did not worry  about the possibility of regulars marching to Concord, since the supplies at Concord were safe, but thought their leaders in Lexington were unaware of the potential danger that night.  Revere and Dawes were sent out to warn them and to alert colonial militias in nearby towns.<ref name="Brooks41">[[#Brooks|Brooks]], pp.41-42</ref>

===Militia warned===
[[Image:Concord Expedition and Patriot Messengers.jpg|thumb|left|350px|Routes of the initial Patriot messengers and of the British Expedition]]
{{further|[[Old North Church]]}}

Dawes covered the southern land route by horseback across [[Boston Neck]] and over the [[Great Bridge (Cambridge)|Great Bridge]] to Lexington.<ref name="Fischer97">[[#Fischer|Fischer]], p. 97</ref>  Revere first gave instructions to send a signal to Charlestown and then he traveled the northern water route. He crossed the [[Charles River]] by rowboat, slipping past the British warship [[HMS Somerset (1748)|HMS ''Somerset'']] at anchor. Crossings were banned at that hour, but Revere safely landed in Charlestown and rode to Lexington, avoiding the British patrol and later warning almost every house along the route. The warned men and the Charlestown colonists dispatched additional riders to the north.<ref name="Brooks4244">[[#Brooks|Brooks]], pp. 42-44</ref>

After they arrived in Lexington, Revere, Dawes, Hancock, and Adams discussed the situation with the militia assembling there. They believed that the forces leaving the city were too large for the sole task of arresting two men and that Concord was the main target. The Lexington men dispatched riders to the surrounding towns, and Revere and Dawes continued along the road to Concord accompanied by [[Samuel Prescott]]. In [[Lincoln, Massachusetts|Lincoln]], they ran into the British patrol led by Major Mitchell.  Revere was captured, Dawes was thrown from his horse, and only Prescott escaped to reach Concord.<ref name="Brooks50">[[#Brooks|Brooks]], p. 50</ref>  Additional riders were sent out from Concord.

Revere and Dawes, as well as many other alarm riders, triggered a flexible system of "alarm and muster" that had been carefully developed months before, in reaction to the colonists' impotent response to the Powder Alarm. "Alarm and muster" was an improved version of an old network of widespread notification and fast deployment of local militia forces in times of emergency. The colonists had periodically used this system all the way back to the early years of Indian wars in the colony, before it fell into disuse in the French & Indian War.  In addition to other express riders delivering their message, bells, drums, alarm guns, bonfires and a trumpet were used for rapid communication from town to town, notifying the rebels in dozens of eastern Massachusetts villages that they should muster their militias because the regulars in numbers greater than 500 were leaving Boston, with possible hostile intentions.  This system was so effective that people in towns {{convert|25|mi|km}} from Boston were aware of the army's movements while they were still unloading boats in Cambridge.<ref name="Fischer138">[[#Fischer|Fischer]], pp. 138-145</ref> These early warnings played a crucial role in assembling a sufficient number of colonial militia to inflict heavy damage on the British regulars later in the day. Adams and Hancock were eventually moved to safety, first to what is now [[Burlington, Massachusetts|Burlington]] and later to [[Billerica, Massachusetts|Billerica]].<ref name="Frothingham60">[[#Frothingham|Frothingham]], p. 60</ref>

===British Army and Marines move out===
[[Image:Lexington Concord Siege of Boston.jpg|300px|thumb|right|1775 map of the battles and of the [[Siege of Boston]]]] 
Around dusk, General Gage called a meeting of all of the senior officers of his army at the Province House. He informed them that orders from Lord Dartmouth had arrived, ordering him to take action against the colonials.  He also told them that the senior colonel of his regiments, Lieutenant Colonel Smith, would command, with Major [[John Pitcairn]] as his executive officer. The meeting adjourned around 8:30 p.m. After the meeting, Earl Percy mingled with town folk on [[Boston Common (park)|Boston Common]]. According to one account, the discussion among persons there turned to the unusual movement of the British soldiers in the town. When Percy questioned one man further, the man replied, "Well, the regulars will miss their aim", "What aim?" asked Percy, "Why, the cannon at Concord" was the reply.<ref name="Fischer96">[[#Fischer|Fischer]], p. 96</ref> Upon hearing this, Percy quickly returned to Province House and relayed this information to General Gage. Stunned, Gage issued orders to prevent messengers from getting out of Boston, but these were too late to prevent Dawes and Revere from leaving.<ref name="Frothingham58">[[#Frothingham|Frothingham]], p. 58</ref>

The British regulars, around 700 [[infantry]], were drawn from 11 of Gage's 13 occupying infantry regiments. For this expedition, Major John Pitcairn commanded 10 elite [[light infantry]] companies, and Lieutenant Colonel Benjamin Bernard commanded 11 [[grenadier]] companies, under the overall command of Lieutenant Colonel Smith.<ref name="Tourtellot105">[[#Tourtellot|Tourtellot]], pp. 105-107</ref> 

Of the troops assigned to the expedition, 350 were from grenadier companies (specialist assault troops) drawn from the [[4th Regiment of Foot|4th (King's Own)]], [[5th Regiment of Foot|5th]],  [[10th Regiment of Foot|10th]],  [[18th Regiment of Foot|18th (Royal Irish)]], [[23rd Regiment of Foot|23rd]], [[38th Regiment of Foot|38th]], [[43rd Regiment of Foot|43rd]], [[47th Regiment of Foot|47th]], [[52nd (Oxfordshire) Regiment of Foot|52nd]] and [[East Lancashire Regiment|59th]]  Regiments of Foot, and the 1st Battalion of [[Royal Marines|His Majesty's Marine Forces]] (the Marines).
Protecting the grenadier companies were the light companies (fast moving flankers, skirmishers and reconnaissance troops), around 320 men, from the [[4th Regiment of Foot|4th (King's Own)]], [[5th Regiment of Foot|5th]],  [[10th Regiment of Foot|10th]],   [[23rd Regiment of Foot|23rd]], [[38th Regiment of Foot|38th]], [[43rd Regiment of Foot|43rd]], [[47th Regiment of Foot|47th]], 52nd and [[East Lancashire Regiment|59th]] Regiments of Foot, and the 1st Battalion, [[Royal Marines|Marines]].  Each company had its own lieutenant, but the majority of the captains commanding them were volunteers attached to them at the last minute, drawn from all of the regiments stationed in Boston.  This lack of bond between commander and company would turn out to be problematic for the regulars.<ref name="FischerRegiments">[[#Fischer|Fischer]], pp. 70, 121</ref>

The British began to awaken their troops at 9 p.m. on the night of April 18 and assembled them on the water's edge on the western end of [[Boston Common]] by 10 p.m. The British march to and from Concord was a disorganized experience from start to finish. Colonel Smith was late in arriving, and there was no organized boat-loading operation, resulting in confusion at the staging area.  The boats used were naval barges that were packed so tightly that there was no room to sit down. When they disembarked at Phipps Farm in present day Cambridge, it was into waist-deep water at midnight. After a lengthy halt to unload their gear, the regulars began their {{convert|17|mi|km}} march to Concord at about 2 a.m.<ref name="Tourtellot105"/> During the wait they were provided with extra ammunition, cold [[salt pork]], and hard [[sea biscuit]]s. They did not carry knapsacks, since they would not be encamped. They carried their haversacks (food bags), canteens, muskets, and accoutrements, and marched off in wet, muddy shoes and soggy uniforms. As they marched through Menotomy, sounds of the colonial alarms throughout the countryside caused the few officers who were aware of their mission to realize they had lost the element of surprise.<ref name="Tourtellot109">[[#Tourtellot|Tourtellot]], pp. 109-115</ref>  One of the regulars recorded in his journal,

[...] To the best of my recollection about 4 oClock in the morning being the 19th of April the 5 front Compys. was ordered to Load which we did.<U+201D><ref>[[#Lister|Jeremy Lister's Journal]]</ref>}}

At about 3 a.m., Colonel Smith sent Major Pitcairn ahead with six companies of light infantry under orders to quick march to Concord. At about 4 a.m., he made the wise but belated decision to send a messenger back to Boston asking for reinforcements.<ref name="Fischer127">[[#Fischer|Fischer]], pp. 127-128</ref>

==Battles==
===Lexington===
As the regulars' advance guard under Pitcairn entered Lexington at sunrise on April 19, 1775, 77 Lexington militiamen emerged from [[Buckman Tavern]] and stood in ranks on the village common watching them, and between 40 and 100 spectators watched from along the side of the road. Their leader was Captain [[John Parker (Captain)|John Parker]], a veteran of the [[French and Indian War]], who was suffering from [[tuberculosis]] and was at times difficult to hear.  Of the militiamen who lined up, nine had the surname Harrington, seven Munroe, four Parker, three Tidd, three Locke, and three Reed.  Fully one quarter of them were related to Captain Parker in some way.<ref name="Fischer158">[[#Fischer|Fischer]], p. 158</ref>  This group of militiamen was part of Lexington's "training band", a way of organizing local militias dating back to the [[Puritans]], and not what was styled a ''[[Minutemen|minuteman company]]''.<ref name="Fischer153">[[#Fischer|Fischer]], p. 153</ref>  Captain Parker was clearly aware that he was outmatched in the confrontation and was not prepared to risk his forces.  Parker was later supposed to have made a statement that is now engraved in stone at the site of the battle: "Stand your ground; don't fire unless fired upon, but if they mean to have a war, let it begin here."<ref name="Coburn63">[[#Coburn|Coburn]], p. 63</ref> According to his sworn deposition taken after the battle:

<!-- please don't "fix" archaic quote spellings without checking the references carefully -->
{{Quotation|<U+201C>I [...] ordered our Militia to meet on the Common in said Lexington to consult what to do, and concluded not to be discovered, nor meddle or make with said Regular Troops (if they should approach) unless they should insult or molest us; and, upon their sudden Approach, I immediately ordered our Militia to disperse, and not to fire:<U+2014>Immediately said Troops made their appearance and rushed furiously, fired upon, and killed eight of our Party without receiving any Provocation therefor from us.<U+201D><ref name="Thomas1775">[[#Thomas|Isaiah Thomas deposition]]</ref><ref name="Tourtellot123">[[#Tourtellot|Tourtellot]], p. 123</ref>|John Parker}}

Rather than turn left towards Concord, Marine Lieutenant Jesse Adair, who was at the head of the advance guard, decided on his own to protect the [[Flanking maneuver|flank]] of the troops by first turning right and then leading the companies down the common itself in a confused effort to surround and disarm the militia. These men ran towards the Lexington militia loudly crying "[[Huzzah]]!" to rouse themselves and to confuse the militia, as they formed a battle line on the common.<ref name="Brooks52">[[#Brooks|Brooks]] pp. 52-53</ref>  Major Pitcairn arrived from the rear of the advance force and led his three companies to the left and halted them. The remaining companies under Colonel Smith lay further down the road toward Boston.<ref name="Fischer189190">[[#Fischer|Fischer]], pp. 189-190.</ref>

====First shot====
A British officer, probably Pitcairn, but accounts are uncertain, as it may also have been [[William Sutherland (British army officer)|Lieutenant William Sutherland]], then rode forward, waving his sword, and called out for the assembled throng to disperse, and may also have ordered them to "lay down your arms, you damned rebels!"<ref name="Fischer190191">[[#Fischer|Fischer]], pp.190-191</ref> Captain Parker told his men instead to disperse and go home, but, because of the confusion, the yelling all around, and due to the raspiness of Parker's tubercular voice, some did not hear him, some left very slowly, and none laid down their arms. Both Parker and Pitcairn ordered their men to hold fire, but a shot was fired from an unknown source.<ref name="Fischer190191"/>

{{Quotation|<U+201D>At 2 o<U+2019>clock we began our march by wading through a very long ford up to the middles; after going a few miles we took three or four people who were going off to give intelligence; about five miles on this side of a town called Lexington, which lay in our road, we heard there were some hundreds of people collected together intending to oppose us and stop our going on; at 5 o<U+2019>clock we arrived there, and saw a number of people, I believe between 200 and 300, formed in a common in the middle of town; we still continued advancing, keeping prepared against an attack through without intending to attack them; but on our coming near them they fired on us two shots, upon which our men without any orders, rushed upon them, fired and put them to flight; several of them were killed, we could not tell how many, because they were behind walls and into the woods. We had a man of the 10th light Infantry wounded, nobody else was hurt. We then formed on the Common, but with some difficulty, the men were so wild they could hear no orders; we waited a considerable time there, and at length proceeded our way to Concord.<U+201D><ref>[[#Dana|John Barker's Diary]]</ref>|John Barker}}

Some witnesses among the regulars reported the first shot was fired by a colonial onlooker from behind a hedge or around the corner of a tavern. Some observers reported a mounted British officer firing first. Both sides generally agreed that the initial shot did not come from the men on the ground immediately facing each other.<ref name="Fischer193">[[#Fischer|Fischer]], p. 193</ref> Speculation arose later in Lexington that a man named Solomon Brown fired the first shot from inside the tavern or from behind a wall, but this has been discredited.<ref name="Fischer402">[[#Fischer|Fischer]], p. 402</ref>  Some witnesses (on each) side claimed that someone on the other side fired first;  however, many more witnesses claimed to not know.  Fischer has recently proposed that there may actually have been multiple near-simultaneous shots.<ref name="FischerShot">[[#Fischer|Fischer]] discusses the shot on pp. 193-194, with detailed footnotes on pp. 399-403, in which he discusses some of the testimony in detail.</ref>

Nobody knew then, nor knows today, with any significant certainty, who fired the first shot of the American Revolution.

Witnesses at the scene described several intermittent shots fired from both sides before the lines of regulars began to fire volleys without receiving orders to do so. A few of the militiamen believed at first that the regulars were only firing powder with no ball, but when they realized the truth, few if any of the militia managed to load and return fire. The rest wisely ran for their lives.<ref name="Fischer194195">[[#Fischer|Fischer]], pp. 194-195</ref>

The regulars then charged forward with bayonets. Captain Parker's cousin Jonas was run through. Eight Massachusetts men were killed and ten were wounded against only one British soldier of the 10th Foot wounded.  The eight colonists killed, the first to die in the Revolutionary War, were John Brown, Samuel Hadley, Caleb Harrington, Jonathon Harrington, Robert Munroe, Isaac Muzzey, Asahel Porter, and Jonas Parker. Jonathon Harrington, fatally wounded by a British musket ball, managed to crawl back to his home, and died on his own doorstep. One wounded man, Prince Estabrook, was a black slave who was serving in the militia.<ref name="Brooks55_56">[[#Brooks|Brooks]], pp. 55-56</ref>

The companies under Pitcairn's command got beyond their officers' control, in part because they were unaware of the actual purpose of the day's mission. They were firing in different directions and preparing to enter private homes. Colonel Smith, who was just arriving with the remainder of the regulars, heard the musket fire and rode forward from the grenadier column to see the action. He quickly found a drummer and ordered him to beat assembly. The grenadiers arrived shortly thereafter, and, once order was restored, the light infantry were then permitted to fire a victory volley, after which the column was reformed and marched on toward Concord.<ref name="Fischer198200">[[#Fischer|Fischer]], pp. 198-200</ref>

===Concord===
[[Image:British Army in Concord Detail.jpg|400px|thumb|left|The British Army enters Concord. The second of four engravings by Amos Doolittle from 1775.]]The militiamen of Concord and Lincoln, in response to the raised alarm, had mustered in Concord.  They received reports of firing at Lexington, and were not sure whether to wait until they could be reinforced by troops from towns nearby, or to stay and defend the town, or to move east and greet the British Army from superior terrain.  A column of militia marched down the road toward Lexington to meet the British, traveling about {{convert|1.5|mi|km|0}} until they met the approaching column of regulars.  As the regulars numbered about 700 and the militia at this time only numbered about 250, the militia column turned about, and marched back into Concord, preceding the regulars by a distance of about {{convert|500|yd|m|0}}.<ref name="Tourtellot152">[[#Tourtellot|Tourtellot]], p. 152</ref>  The militia retreated to a ridge overlooking the town and the command discussed what to do next. Caution prevailed, and Colonel James Barrett surrendered the town of Concord and led the men across the North Bridge to a hill about a mile north of town, where they could continue to watch the troop movements of the British and the activities in the center of town.  This step proved fortuitous, as the ranks of the militia continued to grow as minuteman companies arriving from the western towns were able to join them there.<ref name="Tourtellot154">[[#Tourtellot|Tourtellot]], p. 154</ref>

====The search for militia supplies====
When the troops arrived in the village of Concord, Smith divided them to carry out Gage's orders. The 10th Regiment's company of grenadiers secured South Bridge under Captain Mundy Pole, while seven companies of light infantry under Captain Parsons, numbering about 100, secured the North Bridge near Barrett's force. Captain Parsons took four companies from the 5th, 23rd, 38th and 52nd Regiments up the road {{convert|2|mi|km|1}} past the bridge to search [[Barrett's Farm]], where intelligence indicated supplies would be found.<ref name="Frothingham67">[[#Frothingham|Frothingham]], p. 67</ref> Two companies from the 4th and 10th were stationed to guard their return route, and one company from the 43rd remained guarding the bridge itself.  These companies, which were under the relatively inexperienced command of Captain Walter Laurie, were aware that they were significantly outnumbered by the 400-plus militia men that were only {{convert|200|yd|m|0}} away. The concerned Captain Laurie sent a messenger to Smith requesting reinforcements.<ref name="Fischer215">[[#Fischer|Fischer]], p. 215</ref>

Using detailed information provided by Loyalist spies, the grenadier companies searched the small town for military supplies. When they arrived at Ephraim Jones's tavern, by the jail on the South Bridge road, they found the door barred shut, and Jones refused them entry. According to reports provided by local Tories, Pitcairn knew cannon had been buried on the property. While holding the tavern keeper at gunpoint, he ordered him to show him where the guns were buried. These turned out to be three massive pieces, firing 24-pound shot, much too heavy to use defensively, but very effective against fortifications, and capable of bombarding the city of Boston from the mainland.<ref name="Fischer207">[[#Fischer|Fischer]] p.207</ref> The grenadiers smashed the [[trunnions]] of these three guns so they could not be mounted. They also burned some gun carriages found in the village meetinghouse, and when the fire spread to the meetinghouse itself, local resident Martha Moulton persuaded the soldiers to help in a [[bucket brigade]] to save the building.<ref>[[#Moulton|Martha Moulton deposition]]</ref> Nearly a hundred barrels of flour and salted food, and 550 pounds of musket balls, were thrown into the millpond. Only improvised repairs were possible for the cannon, but all the shot and much of the food was recovered.  During the search, the regulars were generally scrupulous in their treatment of the locals, including insisting on paying for food and drink consumed.  This excessive politeness was used to advantage by the locals, who were able to misdirect searches from several smaller caches of militia supplies.<ref name="Tourtellot155158">[[#Tourtellot|Tourtellot]], pp. 155-158</ref>

[[Barrett's Farm]] had been an arsenal weeks before but few weapons remained now, and these were, according to family legend, quickly buried in furrows to look like a crop had been planted.  The troops sent there did not find any supplies of consequence.<ref name="French197">[[#French|French]], p. 197</ref>

====The North Bridge====
[[Image:Old North Bridge.jpg|thumb|200px|right|The reconstructed North Bridge in Minute Man National Historical Park]]
Colonel Barrett's troops, upon seeing smoke rising from the village square, and seeing only a few companies directly below them, decided to march back toward the town from their vantage point on Punkatasset Hill to a lower, closer flat hilltop about {{convert|300|yd|m|0}} from the North Bridge over the [[Concord River]]. As the militia advanced, the two British companies from the 4th and 10th that held the position near the road retreated to the bridge and yielded the hill to Barrett's men.<ref name="Fischer208">[[#Fischer|Fischer]], p. 208</ref>

Five full companies of Minutemen and five of militia from Acton, Concord, Bedford and Lincoln occupied this hill along with groups of other men streaming in, totaling at least 400 against the light infantry companies from the 4th, 10th, and 43rd Regiments of Foot under Captain Laurie, a force totaling 90&ndash;95 men. Barrett ordered the Massachusetts men to form one long line two deep on the highway leading down to the bridge, and then he called for another consultation. While overlooking North Bridge from the top of the hill, Barrett and the other Captains discussed possible courses of action.  Captain [[Isaac Davis]] of Acton, whose troops had arrived late, declared his willingness to defend a town not their own by saying, "I'm not afraid to go, and I haven't a man that's afraid to go."<ref name="Fischer209">[[#Fischer|Fischer]], p. 209</ref>

Barrett ordered the men to load their weapons but not to fire unless fired upon, and then ordered them to advance. The British companies guarding the bridge were ordered to retreat across it, and one officer then tried to pull up the loose planks of the bridge to impede the colonial advance. Major Buttrick began to yell at the regulars to stop harming the bridge. The Minutemen and militia advanced in column formation on the light infantry, keeping to the highway only, since the highway was surrounded by the spring floodwaters of the Concord River.<ref name="Fischer209212">[[#Fischer|Fischer]], pp. 209-212</ref> 

Captain Laurie then made a poor tactical maneuver. Since his summons for help had not produced any results, he ordered his men to form positions for "street firing" behind the bridge in a column running perpendicular to the river.  This formation was appropriate for sending a large volume of fire into a narrow alley between the buildings of a city, but not for an open path behind a bridge. Confusion reigned as regulars retreating over the bridge tried to form up in the street-firing position of the other troops. Lieutenant Sutherland, who was in the rear of the formation, saw Laurie's mistake and ordered flankers to be sent out. But as he was from a company different from the men under his command, only three soldiers obeyed him. The remainder tried as best they could in the confusion to follow the orders of the superior officer.<ref name="Fischer212">[[#Fischer|Fischer]], p. 212</ref>

[[Image:North Bridge Fight Detail.jpg|400px|thumb|right|The engagement at the North Bridge in Concord. The third of four engravings by Amos Doolittle from 1775.]]

A shot rang out, and this time there is certainty from depositions taken from men on both sides afterwards that it came from the British Army's ranks. It was likely a warning shot, fired by a panicked, exhausted British soldier from the 43rd, according to Laurie's letter to his commander after the fight. Two other regulars then fired immediately after that, shots splashing in the river, and then the narrow group up front, possibly thinking the order to fire had been given, fired a ragged volley before Laurie could stop them.<ref name="Brooks67">[[#Brooks|Brooks]], p. 67</ref>

Two of the [[Acton, Massachusetts|Acton]] Minutemen, private Abner Hosmer and Captain Isaac Davis, at the head of the line marching to the bridge, were hit and killed instantly. Four more men were wounded, but the militia only halted when Major Buttrick yelled the order, "Fire, for God's sake, fellow soldiers, fire!"<ref name="Tourtellot165">[[#Tourtellot|Tourtellot]], pp. 165-166</ref><ref name="Brooks67"/> At this point the lines were separated by the Concord River, the bridge, and were only {{convert|50|yd|m|0}} apart.  The few front rows of colonists, bound by the road, and blocked from forming a line of fire, managed to fire over each others' heads and shoulders at the regulars. The musket balls plunged down out of the sky into the massed regulars. Four of the eight British officers and sergeants, who were leading from the front of their troops as officers did in this era, were wounded by the volley of musketry coming from the colonists.  At least three privates (Thomas Smith, Patrick Gray and James Hall, all from the 4th) were killed or mortally wounded, and nine were wounded.<ref name="Fischer214">[[#Fischer|Fischer]], p. 214</ref> 

The regulars found themselves trapped in a situation where they were both outnumbered and outmaneuvered. Lacking effective leadership and terrified at the superior numbers of the enemy, with their spirit broken, and never having experienced combat before, they abandoned their wounded, and fled to the safety of the approaching grenadier companies coming from the town center, leaving Captain Parsons and the companies searching for arms at Barrett's Farm isolated.<ref name="Tourtellot165">[[#Tourtellot|Tourtellot]], pp. 165-166</ref>

====After the fight====
[[Image:Minuteman statue 3 - Old North Bridge.jpg|thumb|left|Statue memorializing the battle at the North Bridge, inscribed with verse from Emerson's ''Concord Hymn''.]]

The colonists were stunned by their success. No one had actually believed either side would shoot to kill the other. Some advanced; many more retreated; and some went home to see to the safety of their homes and families.  Colonel Barrett eventually began to recover control and chose to divide his forces. He moved the militia back to the hilltop {{convert|300|yd|m|0}} away and sent Major Buttrick with the Minutemen across the bridge to a defensive position on a hill behind a stone wall.<ref name="Fischer214">[[#Fischer|Fischer]], pp. 214-215</ref>

Lieutenant Colonel Smith heard the exchange of fire from his position in the town moments after he had received the request for reinforcements from Laurie. He quickly assembled two companies of grenadiers to lead towards the North Bridge himself. As these troops marched, they met the shattered remnants of the three light infantry companies running towards them. Smith was concerned about the four companies which had been at Barrett's, since their route to town was now unprotected. When he saw the Minutemen in the distance behind their wall, he halted his two companies and moved forward with only his officers to take a closer look.  One of the Minutemen behind that wall observed, "If we had fired, I believe we could have killed all most every officer there was in the front, but we had no orders to fire and there wasn't a gun fired."<ref name="Fischer216">[[#Fischer|Fischer]], p. 216</ref>  During this tense standoff of about 10 minutes, a mentally ill local man named Elias Brown wandered through both sides selling [[hard cider]].<ref name="Fischer216"/> 

At this point, the detachment of regulars sent to Barrett's farm marched back from their fruitless search of that area. They passed through the now mostly-deserted battlefield, and saw dead and wounded comrades lying on the bridge. There was one who looked to them as if he had been scalped, which angered and shocked the British soldiers. They crossed the bridge and returned to the town by 11:30 a.m, under the watchful eyes of the Minutemen, who maintained their defensive positions.  Even after a small skirmish, and with superior numbers, the colonists, wary of reprisals by the force still in the town, remained alert, refusing to fire, and the regulars did nothing further to provoke them. The regulars continued to search for and destroy colonial military supplies in the town, ate lunch, reassembled for marching, and left Concord after noon.  This delay gave the colonial militiamen from outlying towns additional time to arrive and participate in the running battles that occurred during the regulars' march back to Boston.<ref name="Tourtellot166168">[[#Tourtellot|Tourtellot]], pp. 166-168</ref>

====Concord to Lexington====

Lieutenant Colonel Smith, concerned about the safety of his men, sent flankers to follow a ridge and protect his forces from the roughly 1,000 colonials in the field, as they marched east out of Concord. This ridge ended near Meriam's Corner, a crossroads and a small bridge about a mile (2 km) outside the village of Concord. To cross the narrow bridge, the army column had to stop, dress its line, and close its rank to a mere three soldiers abreast.  Colonial militia companies arriving from the north and east had converged at this point, and presented a clear numerical advantage over the regulars.  As the last of the army column marched over the bridge, colonial militiamen from the [[Reading, Massachusetts|Reading]] militia fired, the regulars turned and fired a volley, and the colonists returned fire. Two regulars were killed and perhaps six wounded with no colonial casualties. Smith sent out his flanking troops again after crossing the small bridge.<ref name="Brooks71">[[#Brooks|Brooks]], p. 71</ref>

Nearly 500 militiamen from [[Chelmsford, Massachusetts|Chelmsford]] had assembled in the woods on Brooks Hill about {{convert|1|mi|km}} past Meriam's Corner. Smith's leading forces charged up the hill to drive them off, but the colonials did not withdraw, and inflicted significant casualties on the attackers. Meanwhile the bulk of Smith's force proceeded along the road to Brooks Tavern where they engaged a single militia company from Framingham, killing and wounding several of them. Smith withdrew his men from Brooks Hill and moved across another small bridge into Lincoln.<ref name="Brooks71"/>

[[Image:Minuteman-250px.jpg|thumb|left|Statue depicting John Parker, captain of the Lexington militia]]

The regulars soon reached a point in the road, where there was a rise, and a curve through a wooded area.  At this point, now known as the "Bloody Angle", 200 men, mostly from the towns of [[Bedford, Massachusetts|Bedford]] and Lincoln, had positioned themselves behind trees and walls in a rocky, tree-filled pasture for an [[ambush]]. Additional militia joined in from the other side of the road, catching the British in a crossfire in a wooded swamp, and the Concord militia closed from behind to attack. Thirty soldiers and four colonial militia were killed.<ref name="Fischer226227">[[#Fischer|Fischer]], pp. 226-227</ref> The regular army soldiers escaped by breaking into a trot, a pace that the colonials could not maintain through the woods and swamps next to this spot in the road. Colonial forces on the road itself behind the British were too densely packed and disorganized to mount an attack.<ref name="Fischer226227"/>

Militia forces at this time had risen to about 2,000, and Smith sent out flankers again.  When three companies of militia ambushed the head of his main force near either Ephraim Hartwell's or (more likely) Joseph Mason's Farm, the flankers closed in and trapped the militia from behind.  Flankers also trapped the Bedford militia after a successful ambush near the Lincoln-Lexington border, but British casualties were mounting from these engagements and from persistent long-range fire, and the exhausted British were running out of ammunition.<ref name="Fischer226227"/>

On the Lexington side of the border, Captain Parker, according to only one uncorroborated  source (Ebenezer Munroe's memoir of 1824), waited on a hill with the reassembled Lexington Training Band (militia), some of them bandaged up from the first fighting of the day.  These men, according to this account written only many years later, did not begin the ambush until Colonel Smith himself came into view.  Smith was wounded in the thigh sometime on the way back to Lexington, and the entire British column was halted in this ambush known as "Parker's Revenge".  Major Pitcairn sent light infantry companies up the hill to clear out any militia sniping at them.<ref name="Brooks7273"/>

The light infantry cleared two additional hills<U+2014>"The Bluff" and "Fiske Hill"<U+2014> and took casualties from ambushes.  Pitcairn fell from his horse, which was injured from firing from Fiske Hill. Now the two principal leaders of the Concord expedition were both injured or unhorsed.  Their men were tired, thirsty, and running low on ammunition.  A few surrendered; most now broke and ran forward in a mob.  Their organized, planned [[withdrawal (military)|withdrawal]] had turned into a [[rout]].  "Concord Hill" remained before Lexington Center, and a few uninjured officers turned around and supposedly threatened their own men with their swords if they would not reform in good order.<ref name="Brooks7273">[[#Brooks|Brooks]], pp. 72-73</ref>

Only one British officer remained uninjured in the leading three companies.  He was considering [[surrender (military)|surrendering]] his men when he heard them up ahead cheering.  A full brigade with artillery of about 1,000 men under the command of Earl Percy had arrived to rescue them.  It was about 2:30 p.m.<ref name="Fischer232">[[#Fischer|Fischer]], p. 232</ref>

During this part of the march, the colonists had fought where possible in large ordered formations (using short-range, smoothbore muskets only) at least eight times. This is contrary to the widely-held myth of scattered individuals firing with longer-range rifles from behind walls and fences, although scattered fire had also occurred, and would be a useful American tactic later in the war. Nobody at Lexington or Concord<U+2014>indeed, anywhere along the Battle Road or later at Bunker Hill<U+2014>had a rifle, according to the historical records.<ref name="Fischer161">[[#Fischer|Fischer]], p. 161</ref>

====Percy's rescue====

General Gage had left orders for reinforcements to assemble in Boston at 4 a.m., but in his obsession for secrecy, he had sent only one copy of the orders to the adjutant of the 1st Brigade whose servant left the envelope on a table.  At about 5 a.m., Smith's request for reinforcements was finally received, and orders were sent for 1st Brigade consisting of the line companies of infantry (the 4th, 23rd, and 47th) and a battalion of British Marines to assemble.  Unfortunately, once again only one copy of the orders were sent to each commander, and the order for the Marines was delivered to the desk of Major Pitcairn, who was on Lexington Common at the time.  After these delays, Percy's brigade, about 1,000 strong, left Boston at about 8:45 a.m.  His troops marched out toward Lexington.  Along the way they marched to the tune of "[[Yankee Doodle]]" to taunt the inhabitants of the area.<ref name="Brooks79">[[#Brooks|Brooks]], p. 79</ref>  By the [[Battle of Bunker Hill]] less than two months later, the song had become a popular anthem for the colonial forces.<ref name="Frothingham178">[[#Frothingham|Frothingham]], p. 178</ref>

[[Image:Percy's Rescue at Lexington Detail.jpg|400px|thumb|right|A view of the south part of Lexington. The fourth of four engravings by Amos Doolittle from 1775.]]

Percy took the land route across Boston Neck and over the Great Bridge, which some enterprising colonials had stripped of its planking to delay their way.<ref name="Tourtellot184185">[[#Tourtellot|Tourtellot]], pp. 184-185</ref>  His men then came upon an absent-minded tutor at [[Harvard University|Harvard College]] and asked him which road would take them to Lexington.  The Harvard man, apparently oblivious to the reality of what was happening around him, showed him the proper road without thinking, and was later compelled to leave the country for inadvertently supporting the enemy.<ref name="Tourtellot185">[[#Tourtellot|Tourtellot]], p. 185</ref>  Percy's troops arrived at Lexington at about 2:00 p.m.  They could hear gunfire in the distance as they set up their cannon and lines of regulars on high ground with commanding views of Lexington.  Colonel Smith's men approached like a fleeing mob with the full regiment of colonial militia in close formation pursuing them.  Percy ordered his artillery to open fire at extreme range, and the colonial militiamen dispersed in terror.  Smith's men collapsed with exhaustion once they reached safety behind friendly lines.<ref name="Fischer241242">[[#Fischer|Fischer]], pp. 241-242</ref>

Against the advice of his Master of Ordnance, Percy had left Boston without spare ammunition for his men or for the two artillery pieces they brought with them, thinking the extra wagons would slow him down.  After Percy had left the city, Gage directed two ammunition wagons guarded by one officer and thirteen men to follow.  This convoy was intercepted by a small party of older, former militiamen, still on the "alarm list" who could not join their militia companies because they were well over 60.  These men rose up in ambush and demanded the surrender of the wagons, but the regulars ignored them and drove their horses on.  The old men opened fire, shot the lead horses, killed two sergeants, and wounded the officer.<ref name="Brooks8182">[[#Brooks|Brooks]], pp. 81-82</ref>  The survivors ran, and six of them threw their weapons into a pond before they surrendered. Each man in Percy's brigade now had only 36 rounds, and each artillery piece only contained a few rounds in side-boxes.<ref name="Fischer243244">[[#Fischer|Fischer]], pp. 243-244</ref>

====Lexington to Menotomy====
[[Image:Percys return.jpg|thumb|left|Percy's return to Charlestown (detail from 1775 map of the battle).]]

Percy regained control of the combined forces of about 1,700 men and let them rest, eat, drink, and have their wounds tended at field headquarters ([[Munroe Tavern (Lexington, Massachusetts)|Munroe Tavern]]) before their final march of the day. They set out from Lexington at about 3:30 p.m., in a formation that emphasized defense along the sides and rear of the column.<ref name="Fischer245"/>

Wounded regulars rode on the cannon and were forced to hop off when they were periodically fired at gathered militia.  Percy's men were often surrounded, but they had the tactical advantage of interior lines.  Percy could shift his units more easily to where they were needed, while the colonial militia were required to move around the outside of his formation. Percy placed Smith's men in the middle of the column, while the 23rd Regiment's line companies were given the task of being the column's rear guard. Because of information provided by Smith and Pitcairn about how the Americans were attacking, Percy ordered the rear guard to be rotated every mile or so, to allow some of his troops to rest briefly. Flanking companies were sent to both sides of the road, and a powerful force of Marines acted as the vanguard to clear the road ahead.<ref name="Fischer245">[[#Fischer|Fischer]], pp. 245-246</ref>

During the respite at Lexington, Brigadier General [[William Heath]] arrived and took command of the militia.  Earlier in the day, he had traveled first to [[Watertown, Massachusetts|Watertown]] to discuss tactics with Joseph Warren, who had left Boston that morning, and other members of the [[Committee of Safety (American Revolution)|Massachusetts Committee of Safety]].  Heath and Warren reacted to Percy's artillery and flankers by ordering the militias to avoid close formations which would attract cannon fire.  Instead, they surrounded Percy's marching square with a moving ring of [[skirmisher]]s at a distance in order to inflict maximum casualties at minimum risk to individual militiamen.<ref name="Fischer250">[[#Fischer|Fischer]], pp. 250-251</ref>

A few mounted militiamen on the road would dismount, fire muskets at the approaching regulars, then remount and gallop ahead to repeat the tactic.  Unmounted militia would often fire from long range, in the hope of hitting somebody in the main column of soldiers on the road and surviving, since both British and colonials used muskets with an effective combat range of fifty yards.  Infantry units would apply pressure to the sides of the British column.  When it moved out of range, those units would move around and forward to re-engage the column further down the road.  Heath sent messengers out to intercept arriving militia units to direct them to the appropriate places along the road to engage the regulars.  Some towns sent supply wagons to assist in feeding and rearming the militia.  Heath and Warren did lead skirmishers in small actions into battle themselves, but it was the presence of effective leadership that probably had the greatest impact on the success of these tactics.<ref name="Fischer250"/>  Percy wrote of the colonial tactics: "[...] the rebels attacked us in a very scattered, irregular manner, but with perseverance and resolution, nor did they ever dare to form into any regular body.  Indeed, they knew too well what was proper, to do so.  Whoever looks upon them as an irregular mob, will find himself very much mistaken."<ref name="Tourtellot203">[[#Tourtellot|Tourtellot]], p. 203</ref>  Nonetheless, the main advantage the colonists enjoyed was in numbers.

[[Image:Jason Russell House - Arlington, Massachusetts.JPG|thumb|left|200px|The [[Jason Russell House]] in Arlington.]]
The fighting grew more intense as Percy's forces crossed from Lexington into Menotomy.  Fresh militia poured gunfire into the British ranks from a distance, and individual homeowners began to fight from their own property.  Some homes were also used as sniper positions.  It now turned into a soldier's nightmare: house-to-house fighting. Jason Russell pleaded for his friends to fight alongside him to defend his house by saying, "An Englishman's home is his castle."<ref name="Fischer256">[[#Fischer|Fischer]], p. 256</ref>  He stayed and was killed in his doorway.  His friends, depending on which account is to be believed, either hid in the cellar, or died in the house from bullets and bayonets after shooting at the soldiers who followed them in.  The [[Jason Russell House]] still stands and contains bullet holes from this fight.  A militia unit that attempted an ambush from Russell's orchard was caught by flankers, and eleven men were killed, some allegedly after they had surrendered.<ref name="Fischer256"/>

Percy lost control of his men, and British soldiers began to commit atrocities to repay for the purported scalping at the North Bridge and for their own casualties at the hands of a distant, often unseen enemy. Based on the word of Pitcairn and other wounded officers from Smith's command, Percy had learned that the Minutemen were using stone walls, trees and buildings in these more thickly settled towns closer to Boston to hide behind and shoot at the column. He ordered the flank companies to clear the colonial militiamen out of such places.<ref name="Fischer258">[[#Fischer|Fischer]], p. 258</ref> 

Many of the junior officers in the flank parties had difficulty stopping their exhausted, enraged men from killing everyone they found inside these buildings. For example, two innocent drunks who refused to hide in the basement of a tavern in Menotomy were killed, because they were suspected of being involved with the day's events.<ref name="Tourtellot197">[[#Tourtellot|Tourtellot]], p. 197</ref> Although many of the accounts of ransacking and burnings were exaggerated later by the colonists for propaganda value (and to get financial compensation from the colonial government), it is certainly true that taverns along the Bay Road were ransacked and the liquor stolen by the troops, who in some cases became drunk themselves.  The church's [[Mass (liturgy)#The Communion rite|communion]] silver was stolen but was later recovered after it was sold in Boston.<ref name="Fischer258"/>  Aged Menotomy resident [[Samuel Whittemore]] killed three regulars before he was attacked by a British contingent and left for dead.  (He recovered from his wounds and died at 96.<ref name="Fischer257">[[#Fischer|Fischer]], p. 257</ref>)  All told, far more blood was shed in Menotomy and Cambridge than in any other town. The colonial rebels lost 25 men killed and nine wounded there, and the British lost 40 killed and 80 wounded, with The 47th Regiment of Foot and the Marines suffering the highest casualties.  Each was about half of the day's fatalities.<ref name="Hurd181">[[#Hurd|Hurd]], p. 181</ref>

====Menotomy to Charlestown====

The British troops crossed the Menotomy River (today's [[Alewife Brook Reservation|Alewife Brook]]) into Cambridge, and the fight grew more intense.  Fresh militia arrived in close array instead of in a scattered formation, and Percy used his two artillery pieces and flankers at a crossroads called Watson's Corner to inflict heavy damage on them.<ref name="Fischer258">[[#Fischer|Fischer]], pp. 258-260</ref>

Earlier in the day, Heath had ordered the Great Bridge to be dismantled.  Percy's brigade was about to approach this broken-down bridge and a riverbank filled with militia when Percy directed his troops down a narrow track (near modern-day [[Porter Square]]) and onto the road to Charlestown.  The militia (numbering about 4,000) were unprepared for this movement, and the circle of fire was broken.  An American force moved to occupy Prospect Hill (in modern-day [[Somerville, Massachusetts|Somerville]]) which dominated the road, but Percy moved his cannon to the front and dispersed them with his last rounds of ammunition.<ref name="Fischer258"/>

A large militia force arrived from [[Salem, Massachusetts|Salem]] and [[Marblehead, Massachusetts|Marblehead]].  They might have cut off Percy's route to Charlestown, but these men halted on nearby Winter Hill and allowed the British to escape.  Some accused the commander of this force, Colonel [[Timothy Pickering]], of permitting the troops to pass because he still hoped to avoid war by preventing a total defeat for the regulars.  Pickering later claimed that he had stopped on Heath's orders, but Heath denied this.<ref name="Fischer258"/>  It was nearly dark when Pitcairn's Marines defended a final attack on Percy's rear as they entered Charlestown.  The regulars took up strong positions on the hills of Charlestown.  Some of them had been without sleep for two days and had marched {{convert|40|mi|km}} in 21 hours, eight hours of which had been spent under fire.  But now they held high ground at sunset while supported by heavy guns from the HMS ''Somerset''. Gage quickly sent over line companies of two fresh regiments<U+2014>the 10th and 64th<U+2014>to occupy the high ground in Charlestown and build fortifications. Although they were begun, the fortifications were never completed and would later be a starting point for the militia works built two months later in June before the [[Battle of Bunker Hill]]. General Heath studied the position of the British Army and decided to withdraw the militia to Cambridge.<ref name="Fischer261">[[#Fischer|Fischer]], p. 261</ref>

==Aftermath==
In the morning, Gage awoke to find [[Siege of Boston|Boston besieged]] by a huge militia army, numbering over 15,000, which had marched from throughout New England.<ref name="Brooks96">[[#Brooks|Brooks]], p. 96</ref>  This time, unlike during the Powder Alarm, the rumors of spilled blood were true, and the Revolutionary War had begun.  The militia army continued to grow as surrounding colonies sent men and supplies. The [[Continental Congress]] would adopt and sponsor these men into the beginnings of the [[Continental Army]].  Even now, after open warfare had started, Gage still refused to impose [[martial law]] in Boston.  He persuaded the town's selectmen to surrender all private weapons in return for promising that any inhabitant could leave town.<ref name="Fischer265">[[#Fischer|Fischer]], p. 265</ref>

In terms of accomplishments and casualties this was not a major battle.  However, in terms of supporting the British political strategy behind the [[Intolerable Acts]] and the military strategy behind the Powder Alarms, the battle was a significant failure because the expedition contributed to the fighting it was intended to prevent and because few weapons were seized.<ref name="Tourtellot203">[[#Tourtellot|Tourtellot]], p. 203</ref>

The actual fighting was followed by a war for British political opinion.  Within four days of the battle, the Massachusetts Provincial Congress had collected scores of sworn testimonies from militiamen and from British prisoners.  When word leaked out one week after the battle that Gage was sending his official description of events to London, the Provincial Congress sent over 100 of these detailed depositions on a faster ship.  They were presented to a sympathetic official and printed by the London newspapers two weeks before Gage's report arrived.<ref name="Brooks96">[[#Brooks|Brooks]], pp. 96-97</ref>  Gage's official report was too vague on particulars to influence anyone's opinion.  [[George Germain, 1st Viscount Sackville|George Germaine]], no friend of the colonists, wrote, "[...] the Bostonians are in the right to make the King's troops the aggressors and claim a victory."<ref name="Fischer275">[[#Fischer|Fischer]], pp. 275-276</ref>  Politicians in London tended to blame Gage for the conflict instead of their own policies and instructions. The British troops in Boston variously blamed General Gage and Colonel Smith for the failures at Lexington and Concord.<ref name="Fischer263">[[#Fischer|Fischer]], p. 263</ref>

The day after the battle, [[John Adams]] left his home in [[Braintree, Massachusetts|Braintree]] to ride along the battlefields.  He became convinced that "the Die was cast, the [[crossing the Rubicon|Rubicon crossed]]."<ref name="Fischer279">[[#Fischer|Fischer]], p. 279</ref>  [[Thomas Paine]] in [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|Philadelphia]] had previously thought of the argument between the colonies and the Home Country as "a kind of law-suit", but after news of the battle reached him, he "rejected the hardened, sullen-tempered [[Pharaoh]] of England forever."<ref name="Fischer280">[[#Fischer|Fischer]], p. 280</ref>  [[George Washington]] received the news at [[Mount Vernon (plantation)|Mount Vernon]] and wrote to a friend, "[...] the once-happy and peaceful plains of America are either to be drenched in blood or inhabited by slaves.  Sad alternative!  But can a virtuous man hesitate in his choice?"<ref name="Fischer280"/>  A group of hunters on the frontier named their campsite Lexington when they heard news of the battle in June.  It eventually became the city of [[Lexington, Kentucky|Lexington]], [[Kentucky]].<ref name="Fischer271">[[#Fischer|Fischer]], p. 271</ref>

==Legacy==
It was important to the early American government that an image of British fault and American innocence be maintained for this first battle of the war.  The history of Patriot preparations, intelligence, warning signals, and uncertainty about the first shot was rarely discussed in the public sphere for decades.  The story of the wounded British soldier at the North Bridge, ''[[hors de combat]]'', struck down on the head by a Minuteman using a hatchet, the purported "scalping", was strongly suppressed. Depositions mentioning some of these activities were not published and were returned to the participants (this notably happened to Paul Revere<ref name="Fischer328">[[#Fischer|Fischer]], pp. 327-328</ref>).  Paintings portrayed the Lexington fight as an unjustified slaughter.<ref name="Fischer328"/>

The issue of which side was to blame grew during the early nineteenth century. For example, older participants' testimony in later life about Lexington and Concord differed greatly from their depositions taken under oath in 1775. All now said the British fired first at Lexington, whereas fifty or so years before, they weren't sure. All now said they fired back, but in 1775, they said few were able to. The "Battle" took on an almost mythical quality in the American consciousness.  Legend became more important than truth. A complete shift occurred, and the Patriots were portrayed as actively fighting for their cause, rather than as suffering innocents.  Paintings of the Lexington skirmish began to portray the militia standing and fighting back in defiance.<ref name="Fischer329">[[#Fischer|Fischer]], p. 329</ref>

[[Ralph Waldo Emerson]] immortalized the events at Old North Bridge in his 1837 ''[[Concord Hymn]]'':<br>
<blockquote><poem>
By the rude bridge that arched the flood,
Their flag to April's breeze unfurled;
Here once the embattled farmers stood;
And fired the shot heard round the world.<ref name="ConcordHymn"/>
</poem></blockquote>
"Concord Hymn" became important because it commemorated the beginning of the American Revolution,  and that for much of the 19th century it became a means by which Americans learned about the Revolution, and helped forge the identity of the nation.<ref>[[#Semansky|Semansky]]</ref>

After 1860, several generations of schoolchildren memorized [[Henry Wadsworth Longfellow|Henry Wadsworth Longfellow's]] poem ''[[Paul Revere's Ride (poem)|Paul Revere's Ride]]''. Historically it is inaccurate (for example, Paul Revere never made it to Concord), but it captures the idea that an individual can change the course of history.<ref name="Fischer331">[[#Fischer|Fischer]], pp. 331-333</ref>

In the 20th century, popular and historical opinion varied about the events of the historic day, often reflecting the political mood of the time.  Isolationist anti-war sentiments before the World Wars bred skepticism about the nature of Paul Revere's contribution (if any) to the efforts to rouse the militia.  [[Anglophile|Anglophilia]] in the United States after the turn of the twentieth century led to more balanced approaches to the history of the battle.  During [[World War I]], a film about Paul Revere's ride was seized under the [[Espionage Act of 1917]] for promoting discord between the United States and Britain.<ref name="Fischer336">[[#Fischer|Fischer]], pp. 336-338</ref>

During the [[Cold War]], Revere was used not only as a patriotic symbol, but also as a capitalist one.  In 1961, novelist [[Howard Fast]] published ''[[April Morning]]'', an account of the battle from a fictional 15-year-old's perspective, and reading of the book has been frequently assigned in secondary schools. A film version was produced for television in 1987, starring [[Chad Lowe]] and [[Tommy Lee Jones]].  In the 1990s, parallels were drawn between American tactics in the [[Vietnam War]] and those of the British Army at Lexington and Concord.<ref name="Fischer340">[[#Fischer|Fischer]], pp. 340-342</ref>

The lands surrounding the North Bridge in Concord, as well as approximately {{convert|5|mi|km}} of the road along with surrounding lands and period buildings between Merriam's Corner and western Lexington are part of [[Minuteman National Historical Park]].  There are walking trails with interpretive displays along routes that the colonists might have used that skirted the road, and the Park Service often has personnel (usually dressed in period dress) offering descriptions of the area and explanations of the events of the day.<ref name="NHPTODO">[[#NHPTODO|Minuteman National Historical Park Things To Do]]</ref>

==Commemorations==

[[Patriots' Day]] is celebrated in honor of the battle in Massachusetts, [[Maine]], and [[Wisconsin]] on the third Monday of April. Re-enactments of Paul Revere's ride are staged, as are the battle on the Lexington Green, and ceremonies and firings are held at the North Bridge.

===Centennial commemoration===
[[Image:Minute Man.JPG|thumb|right|Daniel Chester French's ''Minute Man'']]
On April 19, 1875, [[President of the United States|President]] [[Ulysses S. Grant]] and members of his cabinet joined 50,000 persons to mark the 100th anniversary of the battles. The sculpture by [[Daniel Chester French]], ''The Minute Man'', located at the North Bridge, was unveiled on that day.  A formal [[Ball (dance)|ball]] took place in the evening at the Agricultural Hall in Concord.<ref name="Centennial">[[#Centennial|Concord Centennial Celebration Report]]</ref>

===Bicentennial commemoration===
The Town of Concord invited 700 prominent U.S. citizens and leaders from the worlds of government, the military, the diplomatic corps, the arts, sciences, and humanities to commemorate the 200th anniversary of the battles.  On April 19, 1975, as a crowd estimated at 110,000 gathered to view a parade and celebrate the [[United States Bicentennial|Bicentennial]] in Concord, President [[Gerald Ford]] delivered a major speech near the North Bridge, televised to the nation.<ref>[[#FordTime|Time Magazine, April 25, 1974]]</ref>  He said, in part,

{{Quotation|Freedom was nourished in American soil because the principles of the [[Declaration of Independence]] flourished in our land. These principles, when enunciated 200 years ago, were a dream, not a reality. Today, they are real. Equality has matured in America. Our inalienable rights have become even more sacred. There is no government in our land without consent of the governed.  Many other lands have freely accepted the principles of liberty and freedom in the Declaration of Independence and fashioned their own independent republics. It is these principles, freely taken and freely shared, that have revolutionized the world. The volley fired here at Concord two centuries ago, 'the shot heard round the world,' still echoes today on this anniversary.<ref name="GFord">[[#Ford200|New York Times on Ford's appearance]]</ref>|President Gerald R. Ford}}

<!--  need citation:
President Ford laid a wreath at the base of ''The Minute Man'' statue and then respectfully observed as Sir [[Peter Ramsbotham]], the British Ambassador to the United States, laid a wreath at the grave of British soldiers killed in the battle.  Mr. Ford then rode in his presidential limousine to Lexington, where he delivered brief remarks before 50,000.  The President departed nearby [[Hanscom Air Force Base]] aboard [[Air Force One]], with his aircraft passing low over Concord before heading south to [[Washington, D.C.]]

The Bicentennial commemoration of the battles included the issue of a [[Postage stamps and postal history of the United States of America|U.S. postage stamp]] featuring a painting by artist Henry Sandham (1842&ndash;1912) and a [[Franklin Mint]] coin. Several musical pieces were commissioned to be written and performed for the Bicentennial events, such as [[Norman Dello Joio]]'s "Satiric Dances", Joyce MeKeel's "Toward the Source", as well as David Fielding Smith's award-winning play, ''A Flurry of Birds''.
