'''Sylvain Simard''' (born April 26, 1945) is a politician and academic based in the Canadian province of [[Quebec]]. He has represented [[Richelieu (provincial electoral district)|Richelieu]] in the [[National Assembly of Quebec]] since 1994 and was a [[cabinet minister]] in the governments of [[Lucien Bouchard]] and [[Bernard Landry]]. Simard is a member of the [[Parti Qu<U+00E9>b<U+00E9>cois]] (PQ).

==Early life and career==

Simard was born in [[Chicoutimi]], Quebec. He holds a [[Bachelor of Arts]] degree in Education from the [[Universit<U+00E9> de Montr<U+00E9>al]] (1967), a [[Master of Arts (postgraduate)|Master of Arts]] degree from [[McGill University]] (1970), and a [[Ph.D.]] in [[Comparative Literature]] from the [[University of Bordeaux]] in France (1975). From 1976 to 1994, he was a professor of French literature at the [[University of Ottawa]]. He completed a work entitled ''Mythe et reflet de la France: L'image du Canada en France'' in 1987, examining perceptions of Quebec in France from the time of [[Louis Napoleon]] to World War I.<ref>John Hare, "Ex-minister's witty, anecdotal account of Quebec's diplomatic role," ''Ottawa Citizen'', 15 August 1987, C2.</ref>

Simard's brother, [[Christian Simard]], was a [[Bloc Qu<U+00E9>b<U+00E9>cois]] member of the [[Canadian House of Commons]] from 2004 to 2006.<ref>Norman Delisle, "Le Parti qu<U+00E9>b<U+00E9>cois compte tirer des le<U+00E7>ons de l'<U+00E9>lection de lundi," ''La Presse Canadienne'', 24 January 2006, 4:15 pm.</ref>

==PQ vice-president==

Simard first became involved with the Parti Qu<U+00E9>b<U+00E9>cois as a regional organizer in the [[Outaouais]]. He was elected as the PQ's vice-president in 1981 and argued that the party's internal organization should receive more autonomy from the provincial PQ government of [[Ren<U+00E9> L<U+00E9>vesque]].<ref>Margot Gibb-Clark and Victor Malarek, "Quebec won't play with dice loaded, Levesque tells PQ," ''Globe and Mail'', 5 December 1981, 1.</ref> 

In 1982, he helped organize a street protest against Canadian prime minister [[Pierre Trudeau]]'s patriation of the [[Canadian Constitution]] without Quebec's approval.<ref>"PQ plan to protest constitution arrival with street march," ''Globe and Mail'', 5 April 1982, 20; "PQ calls march start of separation drive," ''Globe and Mail'', 14 April 1982, 8.</ref> Later in the same year, he requested that [[Elections Canada]] incorporate a federal wing of the PQ so that the party could run candidates in the [[Canadian federal election, 1984|next Canadian federal election]]. Some senior party members opposed this measure, which led to the creation of the [[Parti nationaliste du Qu<U+00E9>bec]].<ref>"Ottawa receives PQ request to make party status federal," ''Globe and Mail'', 1 July 1982, 4.</ref> Simard also helped coordinate the PQ's bid to join the [[Socialist International]] in 1983. This was opposed by the [[New Democratic Party of Canada|New Democratic Party]], then the leading [[social democratic]] party in the rest of Canada outside Quebec.<ref>Jeff Sallot, "NDP will oppose PQ bid for entry to socialist club," ''Globe and Mail'', 2 April 1983, 15.</ref> 

Simard supported electoral reform and proposed that future elections in Quebec be conducted under a system of compensatory [[proportional representation]].<ref>Joyce Napier, "Province studying reform of polling system," ''Globe and Mail'', 5 December 1983, 9.</ref> He also encouraged Premier Levesque to shuffle his cabinet and staff in early 1984, arguing that some people had been in the same positions for too long.<ref>Margot Gibb-Clark, "Party needs new blood, PQ officials state," ''Globe and Mail'', 13 January 1984, N3.</ref> His own term as vice-president ended in 1984.

==Political activist==

Simard was encouraged to run as a New Democratic Party candidate in the [[Canadian federal election, 1988|1988 federal election]], at a time when the NDP was seeking to build its support base in Quebec. He ultimately decided against running.<ref>[[Graham Fraser]], "Public regard for Broadbent pushing NDP up in Quebec," ''Globe and Mail'', 16 July 1987, A8.</ref> 

In the same period, Simard became involved with local politics in the Outaouais region. He was a prominent local member of the ''Soci<U+00E9>t<U+00E9> nationale des Qu<U+00E9>b<U+00E9>cois'' and opposed proposed changes to the province's [[Charter of the French Language]].<ref>Jack Aubry, "Vandals splash paint on pro-Bill 101 signs," ''Ottawa Citizen'', 9 January 1987, C1.</ref> He also formed a group called the Gatineau Democratic Movement in 1987, and there was some speculation that he would run for [[mayor]] in that year's [[Gatineau municipal election, 1987|municipal election]]. He ultimately decided against doing so, arguing that it would be irresponsible to split the vote against incumbent [[Ga<U+00E9>tan Cousineau]]. 

Cousineau was narrowly re-elected to the mayoralty, but resigned from office in early 1988.<ref>Jeff Heinrich, "Gatineau group won't field mayoral candidate," 24 September 1987, B1. After the election, Simard accused him of being in a [[conflict-of-interest]] situation due to his part ownership of an office building near the city's planned downtown core. See David Gamble, "Quebec lawyer feels Cousineau broke no rules," ''Ottawa Citizen'', 15 December 1987, C1. Cousineau rejected the claim and described Simard's charges as a [[smear campaign]]. See Sharon Trottier, "Gatineau mayor says citizen group waging 'smear campaign' with conflict charge," ''Ottawa Citizen'', 18 December 1987, B4; Philip Authier, "Cousineau critic enters race for Gatineau mayor," ''Ottawa Citizen'', 22 March 1988, D5. Simard stood by his criticism of the mayor, later saying that Cousineau's investment was inappropriate even though it was not technically illegal. See David Gamble, "Simard would return 'democracy' to Gatineau's city hall if elected," ''Ottawa Citizen'', 20 May 1988, C3.</ref> Simard was the first declared candidate in a [[by-election]] to succeed him, running on a platform of increased democratic consultation, budget cuts that would not affect municipal salaries, and reduced taxes.<ref>David Gamble, "Simard would return 'democracy' to Gatineau's city hall if elected," ''Ottawa Citizen'', 20 May 1988, C3.</ref> He also argued that Gatineau residents should be allowed to have a [[referendum]] on a proposed cultural centre, called for all mayoral candidates to declare their financial interests, and proposed a new municipal code of ethics.<ref>"Put cultural centre to vote, Gatineau mayoral candidate says," ''Ottawa Citizen'', 19 April 1988, C3; David Gamble, "Simard wants candidates to disclose interests," ''Ottawa Citizen'', 21 April 1988, B3.</ref> On election day, he lost to [[Bob Labine]] by only 174 votes.<ref>David Gamble, "Labine wins tight race for mayor in Gatineau," ''Ottawa Citizen'', 6 June 1988, A1. Labine later sued Simard for libel over statements made during the campaign. Simard described the lawsuit as an attempt to muzzle criticism. See Tu Thanh Ha, "Gatineau mayor suing rival for libel," ''Ottawa Citizen'', 8 June 1988, B1. Newspaper reports do not indicate how the matter was resolved.</ref>

Simard was a PQ candidate in the [[Quebec general election, 1989|1989 provincial election]], narrowly losing to [[Quebec Liberal Party|Liberal Party]] cabinet minister [[Guy Rivard]] in the [[Montreal]] division of [[Rosemont (provincial electoral district)|Rosemont]].

From 1990 to 1994, Simard was president of the [[Mouvement National des Quebecois]] (MNQ). In 1991, he argued that a sovereign Quebec would try to reduce the concentration of immigrant communities in [[Montreal]] neighbourhoods. He was quoted as saying, "We can't lower the concentration [of existing communities]; the people who are here are here. But in the future . . . we will have to adjust our welcome of immigrants to our capacities to integrate them." He also argued that francophone Quebecers would need to become more accepting of immigrants and the changes they would bring to Quebec culture.<ref>"Ethnic mix in Montreal worries separatist," ''Toronto Star'', 17 February 1991, A6.</ref> At a MNQ meeting in May 1991, he said that most francophone Quebecers were "remarkably open to the necessity for and the advantages of immigration."<ref>Pauline Couture, "Quebecois voices," ''Globe and Mail'', 22 May 1991, A15.</ref>

As MNQ president, Simard argued that francophone Quebecers were unfairly singled out by [[Canadian federalism|Canadian federalists]] for having condoned racist and xenophobic behaviour in earlier times. In the wake of a public controversy over [[Esther Delisle]]'s ''[[The Traitor and the Jew]]'', which addressed historical [[anti-Semitism]] and [[Quebec nationalism]], Simard said, "Of course we denounce all forms of anti-Semitism and xenophobia, and we don't excuse it even fifty years later. But why should we have to respond to [...] attacks that are obviously politically motivated?"<ref>Andre Picard, "Debate flares over Quebec icon," ''Globe and Mail'', 24 June 1993, A7.</ref> Unlike other Quebec sovereigntist groups, the MNQ under Simard's leadership sought to build links with francophone groups across Canada.<ref>Pauline Couture, "Quebecois voices," ''Globe and Mail'', 14 January 1992, A15.</ref>

Simard called for a referendum on sovereignty in early 1992 and campaigned against the [[Charlottetown Accord]] on Canadian constitutional reform later in the same year.<ref>Rheal Seguin, "Bourassa accepts invitation to lunch," ''Globe and Mail'', 30 July 1992, A1.</ref>

==Legislator==
===Minister of International Relations===

Simard was first elected to the [[National Assembly of Quebec]] for Richelieu in the [[Quebec general election, 1994|1994 provincial election]], defeating Liberal incumbent [[Albert Khelfa]]. The PQ won a [[majority government]] in this election under [[Jacques Parizeau]]'s leadership, and Simard entered the legislature as a government [[backbench]]er. When [[Lucien Bouchard]] succeeded Parizeau as [[premier of Quebec]] on January 29, 1996, he appointed Simard as [[Minister of International Relations (Quebec)|minister of international relations]] and [[Minister responsible for La Francophonie (Quebec)|minister responsible for La Francophonie]], with further responsibilities for the [[Minister responsible for the Outaouais (Quebec)|Outaouais region]]. On January 22, 1997, Simard was given additional responsibilities as [[Minister responsible for international humanitarian action (Quebec)|minister responsible for international humanitarian action]].

Soon after his appointment, Simard warned the Canadian government to consider the possibility of a violent reaction if it ever tried to partition the predominantly federalist areas from a future, sovereign Quebec. This was in response to a statement by Canadian [[Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs (Canada)|intergovernmental affairs minister]] [[St<U+00E9>phane Dion]], who said that if Canada was divisible, then Quebec would be as well.<ref>Edison Stewart and Derek Ferguson, "Use of force to be avoided minister says," ''Toronto Star'', 2 February 1996, A11.</ref>

In March 1996, Simard announced that Quebec would close thirteen of its nineteen foreign delegations as a cost-saving measure. He added that Quebec representatives in some of the affected areas could operate from within Canadian embassies, promoting both Quebec trade interests and sovereignty.<ref>Rheal Seguin, "PQ wants to sell separatism through Canadian missions," ''Globe and Mail'', 29 March 1996, A5.</ref> Canadian [[Deputy Prime Minister (Canada)|deputy prime minister]] [[Sheila Copps]] responded that Quebec representatives would "absolutely not" be allowed to promote Quebec sovereignty in Canadian facilities, and Simard's plan was widely criticized in the rest of Canada.<ref>"Copps rebuffs separatists," ''Globe and Mail'', 30 March 1996, A9; "It's Canada guys", ''Toronto Star'', 1 April 1996, A16; David Olive, "Enough Is Enough", ''Globe and Mail'', 31 May 1996, 12.</ref>

Simard took part in a bid for Quebec to receive special status at the [[United Nations]] in 1997. This was defeated by the Canadian government.<ref>Rheal Seguin and Jeff Sallot, "Quebec's bid for UN status quashed," ''Globe and Mail'', 21 June 1997, A4.</ref> Later in the same year, he quarreled with federal politicians over the terms of a child-support agreement between Quebec and France; the Canadian government argued that some sections of the deal came close to defining Quebec as a sovereign country.<ref>"Deadlock stalls deal on support payments," ''Globe and Mail'', 11 November 1997, A6.</ref> Simard also threatened a boycott of the 2001 Francophone Games in Ottawa and [[Hull, Quebec|Hull]], on the grounds that the federal government was excluding Quebec from the organizing committee.<ref>Rheal Seguin, "Quebec threatens boycott, says Copps playing games," ''Globe and Mail'', 20 March 1998, A4.</ref>

As minister of international relations, Simard represented Quebec in trade and diplomatic missions to France, China, [[Vietnam]], [[Senegal]], [[C<U+00F4>te d'Ivoire]], [[Israel]], [[Palestinian Territories|Palestine]], [[Lebanon]], and [[Zimbabwe]].<ref>Rod Mickleburgh, "Quebecker plays it cool in China," ''Globe and Mail'', 7 September 1996, A11; "PRESS DIGEST - Vietnam - Sept 11," ''Reuters News'', 11 September 1996; "Quebec business team winds up Senegal mission," ''Agence France-Presse'', 5 March 1997; Marc Koffi, "LA C<U+00D4>TE D'IVOIRE VEUT S<U+00C9>DUIRE LES FIRMES QU<U+00C9>BECOISES," ''Reuters - Les actualit<U+00E9>s en fran<U+00E7>ais'', 6 March 1997, 10:22 am; "Funeral sparks more West Bank riots," ''Globe and Mail'', 10 April 1997, A14; "Quebec, Lebanon should strengthen economic relations: Lebanese PM," ''Agence France-Presse'', 14 April 1997; "Qu<U+00E9>bec-Le ministre des Affaires internationales <U+00E0> Paris," ''Reuters - Les actualit<U+00E9>s en fran<U+00E7>ais'', 7 July 1997, 10:38 am; "Zimbabwe, Canada to Increase Cooperation," ''Xinhua News Agency'', 27 April 1998, 11:50 am.</ref> He was skeptical of the [[Multilateral Agreement on Investment]] and encouraged Canada to withdraw from negotiations around the accord in October 1998.<ref>Heather Scoffield, "Nations seek to salvage MAI Without France," ''Globe and Mail'', 19 October 1998, B4.</ref>

In late November 1996, Simard criticized [[Charles Aznavour]] after the well-known troubadour sang some of his best-known songs in English during a concert in [[Ottawa]]. The minister was quoted as saying, "Charles Aznavour is a French singer and when he comes here he should sing in French. It shows a complete ignorance of the reality and sensibilities of Quebec society <U+2014> it's a provocation."<ref>"Nasty politics of language", ''Hamilton Spectator'', 18 November 1996, A8.</ref>

Simard was re-elected in the [[Quebec general election, 1998|1998 Quebec election]], but was dropped from cabinet on December 15, 1998. In 2000, he co-authored a procedural review document recommending that elected representatives be given more opportunities to consider and scrutinize proposed legislation.<ref>"Assembl<U+00E9>e nationale du Qu<U+00E9>bec - UN GROUPE DE TRAVAIL DE DEPUTES PROPOSE," ''Canada NewsWire'', 16 June 2000.</ref>

===Minister of Citizenship and Immigration===

Simard rejoined Lucien Bouchard's cabinet on October 6, 2000, as the [[Minister of Citizenship and Immigration (Quebec)|minister of citizenship and immigration]]. Soon after his appointment, he announced that Quebec would increase its annual immigration rate from 30,000 to a figure between 40,000 and 45,000 by 2003, while also raising its rate of francophone immigration from 44% to 52%.<ref>Norman Delisle, "Qu<U+00E9>bec veut augmenter consid<U+00E9>rablement le nombre d'immigrants accueillis," ''La Presse Canadienne'', 26 October 2000, 04:03 pm.</ref> Echoing his statements from a decade earlier, he called for an increased settlement of immigrants into areas outside of Montreal to facilitate their integration to Quebec society.<ref>"Quebec wants more immigrants to live in regions and integrate into society," ''Canadian Press'', 26 October 2000, 06:39 pm.</ref> In March 2001, he announced that the numbers of both educated and francophone immigrants to Quebec were increasing and that the province would look to the [[Maghreb]] for more francophone immigration in upcoming years.<ref>"Le profil de l'immigrant au Qu<U+00E9>bec a chang<U+00E9>; il est plus scolaris et plus francophone," ''Nouvelles Tele-Radio'', 1 March 2001, 1:41 pm.</ref>

In late 2000, Simard said that he would not serve alongside [[Yves Michaud]], a candidate for the PQ nomination in an upcoming Montreal [[by-election]]. Michaud had characterized Jewish support for the [[Canadian federalist]] option in the [[Quebec referendum, 1995|1995 Quebec referendum]] as an "ethnic vote against the sovereignty of the Quebec people" and described [[B'nai Brith Canada]] as "anti-sovereigntist extremists." He was also quoted as saying that Jews believed themselves to be "the only people in the world who have suffered." Simard described Michaud's comments as "an old anti-Semitic throwback that leave me no choice but to condemn." Michaud, in turn, contended that he was "falsely demonized" by the reporting of his comments and was not anti-Semitic.<ref>Rheal Seguin, "Pequiste's anti-Jewish remarks condemned," ''Globe and Mail'', 15 December 2000, A1.</ref> This controversy exposed divisions in the ranks of the PQ and is widely believed to have provoked Lucien Bouchard's resignation as premier shortly thereafter.<ref>[[Don Macpherson (journalist)|Don Macpherson]], "Who's afraid of Lucien Bouchard?", ''Montreal Gazette'', 20 February 2010, B7.</ref>

===President of the Treasury Board===
When Bouchard resigned from office in early 2001, Simard supported [[Bernard Landry]]'s successful bid to become the party's new leader.<ref>Norman Delisle, "D<U+00E9>bats d'id<U+00E9>es et course au leadership semblent incompatibles, dit-on au PQ," ''La Presse Canadienne'', 17 January 2001, 2:44 pm; Robert McKenzie, "Rivals topple in dirty PQ leadership race," ''Toronto Star'', 21 January 2001, 1.</ref> Landry was sworn in as premier on March 8, 2001, and re-assigned Simard as [[President of the Treasury Board (Quebec)|president of the treasury board]], [[Minister of State for Administration and the Public Service (Quebec)|minister of state for administration and the public service]], [[Minister responsible for Administration and the Public Service (Quebec)|minister responsible for administration and the public service]], and minister responsible for the Outaouais.

Simard issued his first report as treasury board president on March 29, 2001, indicating that government spending would increase by 3.1% in 2001-02 with three-quarters of the new revenues going to health and education. He added that spending as a percentage of gross domestic product would decline, as it had in previous years.<ref>Marie Tison, "Le gouvernement qu<U+00E9>b<U+00E9>cois augmentera ses d<U+00E9>penses de 3,1 pour cent," ''La Presse Canadienne'', 29 March 2001, 5:19 pm.</ref> Later in 2001, he announced that Quebec would take nearly one billion dollars from its reserve fund to avoid going into deficit amid a serious North American economic downturn.<ref>"Qu<U+00E9>bec envisage des investissements pour contrer le ralentissement," ''La Presse Canadienne'', 27 September 2001, 10:04 am.</ref> In November 2001, Simard launched a $220 million initiative to ensure [[pay equity]].<ref>Michel H<U+00E9>bert, "Equit<U+00E9> salariale: le gouvernement du Qu<U+00E9>bec versera encore $220 millions," ''La Presse Canadienne'', 21 November 2001, 5:43 pm.</ref>

Simard launched a major recruitment campaign in early 2001, seeking to fill 1,500 full-time and 5,000 part-time public service positions. This was described as the department's most important outreach program in twenty years.<ref>"Qu<U+00E9>bec lance une vaste campagne de recrutement dans la fonction publique," ''Nouvelles Tele-Radio'', 2 April 2001, 4:52 pm; "Fonction publique du Qu<U+00E9>bec - Qu<U+00E9>bec lance la plus vaste campagne de recrutement depuis 20 ans" [press release], ''Canada Newswire'', 12 April 2001.</ref> In making the announcement, Simard indicated that minority groups, including anglophones and youth, would receive fair representation.<ref>"Conseil du tr<U+00E9>sor - Fonction publique du Qu<U+00E9>bec" [press release], ''Canada Newswire'', 15 June 2001; Michel H<U+00E9>bert, "La fonction publique du Qu<U+00E9>bec ouvrira ses portes aux jeunes et aux minorit<U+00E9>s," 26 June 2001, 02:20 pm.</ref>

Simard also served on a cabinet committee overseeing strategies for Quebec's [[asbestos]] sector in this period.<ref>"Qu<U+00E9>bec confirme la cr<U+00E9>ation d'un comit<U+00E9> interminist<U+00E9>riel sur l'amiante," ''Nouvelles Tele-Radio'', 17 May 2001, 02:04 pm; "Utilisation de l'amiante chrysotile" [press release], ''Canada Newswire'', 17 May 2001.</ref>

===Minister of Education===

Bernard Landry shuffled his cabinet on January 30, 2002, and re-assigned Simard as [[Minister of State for Education and Employment (Quebec)|minister of state for education and employment]], [[Minister of Education (Quebec)|minister of education]], [[Minister responsible for Employment (Quebec)|minister responsible for employment]], and minister responsible for the Outaouais. Simard delivered an education policy statement in March 2002, in which he promised to maintain Quebec's longstanding freeze on university [[tuition]] rates and remove a legislative loophole that allowed non-anglophone parents to send their children to English public schools after one year at an English private school.<ref>"Le ministre Sylvain Simard fait part de ses id<U+00E9>es pour am<U+00E9>liorer l'<U+00E9>ducation," ''Nouvelles Tele-Radio'', 6 March 2002, 8:06 am; "Alliance Qu<U+00E9>bec entend se battre pour maintenir l'acc<U+00E8>s <U+00E0> l'<U+00E9>cole anglaise," ''Nouvelles Tele-Radio'', 6 March 2002, 11:33 am; "Quebec education minister ready to crack down on language loopholes," ''Canadian Press'', 11 March 2002, 02:45 pm; Alexander Panetta, "Quebec to shut law loophole that allows children of rich into English schools," ''Canadian Press'', 17 March 2002, 01:40 pm.</ref> 

He announced a $91 million program for reforming Quebec's secondary schools in January 2003, highlighted by increased tutoring, a focus on history and the French language as well as upgrades to the sciences, and new steps to target the provincial dropout rate.<ref>"Qu<U+00E9>bec d<U+00E9>bloque 91 millions$ pour l'<U+00E9>ducation secondaire," ''Les actualit<U+00E9>s canadiennes de Reuters en fran<U+00E7>ais'', 14 January 2003, 12:16 pm; Rheal Seguin, "Quebec tutorial program gets $91-million in funds," ''Globe and Mail'', 15 January 2003, A2; "Quebec government announces spending to upgrade teachers, schools," ''Canadian Press'', 14 January 2003, 11:18 pm.</ref> He introduced another plan in the same month to counter schoolyard harassment and intimidation.<ref>Lia Levesque, "Le ministre Sylvain Simard annonce son plan d'action contre le taxage," ''La Presse Canadienne'', 23 January 2003, 05:42 pm.</ref> He was strongly critical of the right-wing [[Action d<U+00E9>mocratique du Qu<U+00E9>bec]]'s proposal to introduce a system of [[school voucher]]s to the province.<ref>Marianne White, "Quebec separatists train guns on right-wing threat," ''Reuters News'', 3 October 2002, 04:37 pm; "PQ talks aim at rival Liberals and Mario Dumont's ADQ at caucus meeting," ''Canadian Press'', 3 October 2002, 7:22 pm.</ref>

Simard was one of the few ministers in the Landry government with a strong interest in promoting [[Quebec sovereignty]].<ref>Rheal Seguin, "New Quebec cabinet not exactly hotbed for sovereignty push," ''Globe and Mail'', 1 February 2002, A8.</ref> In February 2003, he argued that Quebec would receive an additional $800 million in education spending if the "[[fiscal imbalance]]" between Quebec and the Canadian federal government was fixed.<ref>Norman Delisle, "Qu<U+00E9>bec voudrait pouvoir compter sur 800 millions $ de plus en ducation," ''La Presse Canadienne'', 7 February 2003, 5:29 pm.</ref>

===Opposition member===

The Liberal Party under [[Jean Charest]] defeated the PQ in the [[Quebec general election, 2003|2003 provincial election]]. Simard was re-elected in Richelieu by a reduced margin and served as [[Official Opposition|opposition]] critic for the treasury board and public service.<ref>"Bernard Landry d<U+00E9>voile la composition de son cabinet fant<U+00F4>me," ''La Presse Canadienne'', 1 May 2003, 10:32 am.</ref> He was named as the PQ's chief organizer in October 2004.<ref>Norman Delisle, "Sylvain Simard devient l'organisateur en chef du Parti qu<U+00E9>b<U+00E9>cois," ''La Presse Canadienne'', 7 October 2004, 01:49 pm; Martin Ouellet, "Qu<U+00E9>bec pr<U+00E9>sente une version amend<U+00E9>e du projet de loi sur les PPP," ''La Presse Canadienne'', 1 December 2004, 05:17 pm.</ref> Simard was strongly critical of the Charest government's cuts to economic development and the public service, as well as its move toward [[public-private partnership]]s.<ref>Les Perreaux, "Quebec guts economic development and cuts welfare, budget details reveal," ''Canadian Press'', 13 June 2003, 5:20 pm; Norman Delisle, "Le minist<U+00E8>re du Revenu met <U+00E0> pied 30 employ<U+00E9>s du service de pension alimentaire," ''La Presse Canadienne'', 7 April 2004, 04:30 pm; Les Perreaux, "Quebec to shrink government by eliminating 16,000 posts in 10 years," ''Canadian Press'', 5 May 2004, 3:56 pm; "L'opposition <U+00E0> la construction d'une prison en partenariat s'accentue," ''Nouvelles Tele-Radio'', 19 January 2005, 5:25 pm.</ref> In 2006, he brought forward a [[private member's bill]] to create a pension benefits guarantee fund.<ref>Sheryl Smolkin, "Pension guarantee fund proposed by Quebec private member," 20 April 2006, Vol. 3, No. 13.</ref>

Simard called for a public inquiry into federalist spending practices during the [[Quebec referendum, 1995|1995 referendum on sovereignty]] in 2005, following statements by a high-ranking [[Liberal Party of Canada]] organizer that the federalist side had "violated" and "flouted" Quebec's election laws. Simard was quoted as saying, "We don't want to rewrite the past. What is done is done. What we need are new ground rules and the means to ensure that that this doesn't happen again."<ref>Rh<U+00E9>al Seguin, "Corbeil's allegations spark calls for inquiry," ''Globe and Mail'', 23 April 2005, A13.</ref>

Simard supported [[Bernard Landry]]'s bid to retain the PQ leadership after the 2003 election,<ref>Les Perreaux, "Senior Parti Quebecois members rally to once-embattled leader Bernard Landry," ''Canadian Press'', 3 June 2005, 9:13 pm.</ref> but nonetheless helped Landry reach his decision to resign after receiving only 76 per cent support at the party's June 2005 convention. Later in the same year, Simard supported [[Andr<U+00E9> Boisclair]]'s successful bid to succeed Landry as party leader.<ref>"Sylvain Simard appuie Boisclair et critique les r<U+00E8>gles de mise en candidature," ''Nouvelles Tele-Radio'', 30 August 2005, 3:45 pm.</ref> 

Simard suggested lifting Quebec's tuition freeze in 2006, arguing that it had created a state of "perpetual underfunding" for universities. The PQ's youth wing opposed this suggestion, and a subsequent policy workshop reaffirmed the party's support for the freeze.<ref>Philip Authier, "PQ to debate costly plan to extend school hours: 8 a.m. to 5 p.m", ''Montreal Gazette'', 11 June 2006, A6.</ref>

The PQ fell to a third-place finish in the [[Quebec general election, 2007|2007 general election]], and Simard was again re-elected by a reduced margin over a strong challenge from an ADQ candidate. Following the election, he was one of the few PQ MNAs who still supported Boisclair's leadership.<ref>"Les p<U+00E9>quistes appuyant Boisclair <U+00E0> 100% ne seraient plus qu'une poign<U+00E9>e," ''La Presse Canadienne'', 25 April 2007, 1:43 pm.</ref> When Boisclair resigned, Simard planned to support [[Gilles Duceppe]]'s bid to lead the party.<ref>Rh<U+00E9>al Seguin and Daniel LeBlanc, "Duceppe decides against PQ leadership bid," ''Globe and Mail'', 12 March 2007 (breaking news).</ref> Duceppe ultimately decided not to run, and [[Pauline Marois]] was chosen as Boisclair's successor. 

The PQ returned to official opposition status in the [[Quebec general election, 2008|2008 election]] under Marois's leadership, and Sylvain was re-elected by an increased margin. He was re-appointed as critic for the treasury board and public service after the election.<ref>"PAULINE MAROIS PR<U+00C9>SENTE LA NOUVELLE <U+00C9>QUIPE PARLEMENTAIRE DE L'OPPOSITION OFFICIELLE," ''Canada Newswire'', 9 January 2009, 3:58 pm.</ref> In March 2009, he argued that the government could save four billion dollars by building two new university teaching hospitals in Montreal as conventional projects rather than as private-public partnerships.<ref>Kevin Dougherty, "Hospital PPPs should be scrapped to save $4B: critic," ''Montreal Gazette'', 28 March 2009, A6. See also Kevin Dougherty and Aaron Derfel, "Province on the hook for up to $1 billion; Advance for superhospitals: Private sector can only raise 55 per cent of cost," ''Montreal Gazette'', 12 December 2009, A12.</ref> The following year, he accused the Charest government of falsifying cost estimates to favour the public-private approach.<ref>Kevin Dougherty, "Auditor general's latest report on cost of two new hospitals "most devastating" yet, critic says," ''Montreal Gazette'', 9 June 2010.</ref>

In early 2011, Pauline Marois said that she favoured extending Quebec's [[Charter of the French Language]] to restrict non-anglophone students from attending English-language [[CEGEP]]s. Simard openly disagreed with this policy approach, which was approved by delegates to a PQ convention in April 2011.<ref>Philip Authier, "Marois firm on extending Bill 101 rules to CEGEPs," ''Montreal Gazette'', 28 January 2011, A11; Les Perreaux, "PQ leader wins 93 per cent of vote," ''Globe and Mail'', 18 April 2011, A5.</ref>

In May 2011, Simard introduced a [[private member's bill]] to protect [[whistleblower]]s in the Quebec civil service.<ref>Linda Gyulai, "City's whistleblower policy silences staff; Credibility of hotline called into question," ''Montreal Gazette'', 10 May 2011, A3.</ref>

In June 2012 he announced that he would not run for re-election. <ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.lapresse.ca/actualites/quebec-canada/politique-quebecoise/201206/27/01-4538843-depart-de-sylvain-simard-demissions-dans-groulx.php|title=D<U+00E9>part de Sylvain Simard, d<U+00E9>missions dans Groulx|author=Tommy Chouinard|date=27 June 2012|newspaper=La Presse}}</ref>
