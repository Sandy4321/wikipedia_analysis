'''Yeovil''' ({{pron-en|<U+02C8>jo<U+028A>v<U+026A>l}} {{Respell|YOH|vil}}) is a town and [[civil parish]] in south [[Somerset]], England. The parish had a population of 27,949 at the 2001 census,<ref name="popn"/> although the wider urban area had a population of 42,140.<ref name="caller">{{cite web|url=http://www.southsomerset.gov.uk/media/pdf/i/l/An_Introduction_to_South_Somerset.pdf|title=An introduction to South Somerset|publisher=South Somerset Council|last=Caller|first=Tracey|year=2007|pages=3|accessdate=25 April 2010}}</ref> The town lies within the local district of [[South Somerset]] and the [[Yeovil (UK Parliament constituency)|Yeovil parliamentary constituency]].

It has [[palaeolithic]] remains, was on an old [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] road and was recorded in the [[Domesday Book]] as the town of ''Givle'', and later became a centre for the glove making industry. During the [[Middle Ages]] the population of the town suffered from the [[Black Death]] and several serious fires. In the 20th century it developed into a centre of the aircraft and defence industries, which made it a target for bombing in [[World War II]], with one of the largest employers being [[AgustaWestland]] who manufacture helicopters. Several other manufacturing and retail companies also have bases in the town. In the 21st century Yeovil became the first town in Britain to institute a system of [[biometric]] [[fingerprint]] scanning in nightclubs and the first English council to ban the children's craze [[Heelys]]. Plans have been proposed for various regeneration projects in the town.

Yeovil Country Park, which includes [[Ninesprings]], is one of several open spaces in the town. There are a range of educational, cultural and sporting facilities. Religious sites include the 14th century [[Church of St John the Baptist, Yeovil|Church of St John the Baptist]]. It is on the [[A30 road|A30]] and [[A37 road|A37]] roads and has two railway stations on two separate railway lines. [[Yeovil Pen Mill railway station|Yeovil Pen Mill]] is on the [[Heart of Wessex Line|Bristol to Weymouth line]] served by [[First Great Western]] [[train operating company]] services, whilst [[Yeovil Junction railway station|Yeovil Junction]] is on the [[West of England Main Line|London Waterloo to Exeter line]] served by [[South West Trains]].

In April 2006 Yeovil became the first town in Britain to institute a somewhat controversial system of [[biometric]] [[fingerprint]] scanning in nightclubs. Individuals wishing to gain access to one of the town's nightclubs were asked in the first instance to submit their personal details for inclusion in a central system. This included a photograph and index fingerprint. Thereafter, each entry to one of the participating premises will require a fingerprint scan. If the system is proved successful at reducing crime and violence, it will be introduced in towns throughout the country.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/somerset/4951810.stm|title=BBC - Clubs to begin finger scan pilot | work=BBC News | date=27 April 2006 | accessdate=6 April 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2006/may/01/ukcrime.prisonsandprobation|title=Guardian - Fingerprint scanners call time on yobs in Britain's Wild West | work=The Guardian | location=London | first=Steven | last=Morris | date=2 May 2006 | accessdate=6 April 2010}}</ref> In February 2007, Yeovil Town Council became the first English council to ban the children's craze [[Heelys]].

===International links===
There is, in [[Johannesburg]], [[South Africa]], a suburb called [[Yeoville]] which has a link to Yeovil. It was proclaimed in 1890 by one [[Thomas Yeo Sherwell]], a native of Yeovil. He named the streets after his sons, friends and business associates.

==Geography==
Yeovil is situated at the southern boundary of Somerset, close to the border with [[Dorset]], {{convert|130|mi|km|0}} from [[London]], {{convert|40|mi|km|0}} south of [[Bristol]] and {{convert|30|mi|km|0}} from [[Taunton]]. The suburbs include: Summerlands, Hollands, '''Houndstone''', [[Preston Plucknett]], Penn Mill, New Town, Hendford, Old Town, Forest Hill, Abbey Manor, Great Lyde. 
Outlying villages include [[East Coker]], [[West Coker]], [[Hardington]], [[Evershot]], [[Halstock]], [[Stoford]], [[Barwick, Somerset|Barwick]], [[Sutton Bingham]], [[Mudford]] and [[Yetminster]]. Other nearby villages include [[Bradford Abbas]], [[Thornford]] [[Corscombe]], [[Montacute]] (where one will find [[Montacute House]]), and [[Pendomer]]. The village of [[Brympton]], now almost a [[suburb]] of Yeovil, contains the [[medieval]] [[Manorialism|manor]] of [[Brympton d'Evercy]]. [[Tintinhull]] is also a village close to Yeovil featuring the National Trust owned [[Tintinhull|Tintinhull House and Gardens]]. 

[[Ninesprings|Ninesprings Country Park]] is in the south east near Penn Hill. It is linked to by a cycleway following the route of the old railway to Riverside Walk, Wyndham Hill and Summerhouse Hill forming the {{convert|40|ha|acre|sing=on}} Yeovil Country Park.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.naturalengland.org.uk/ourwork/enjoying/places/countryparks/countryparksnetwork/findacountrypark/yeovil.aspx|title=Yeovil Counrty Park|publisher=Natural England|accessdate=22 March 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.southsomerset.gov.uk/index.jsp?articleid=693|title=Yeovil Country Park|publisher=South Somerset Council|accessdate=22 March 2010}}</ref>

===Climate===
Along with the rest of [[South West England]], Yeovil has a temperate climate which is generally wetter and milder than the rest of the country. The annual mean temperature is approximately {{convert|10|<U+00B0>C|<U+00B0>F|1|lk=on}} and shows a seasonal and a [[Diurnal motion|diurnal]] variation, but due to the modifying effect of the sea the range is less than in most other parts of the UK. January is the coldest month with mean minimum temperatures between {{convert|1|<U+00B0>C|<U+00B0>F|1}} and {{convert|2|<U+00B0>C|<U+00B0>F|1}}. July and August are the warmest months in the region with mean daily maxima around {{convert|21|<U+00B0>C|<U+00B0>F|1}}.<ref name="weather">{{cite web | title=About south-west England | work=Met Office |url=http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/climate/uk/sw/ | accessdate=22 March 2010}}</ref>

The south-west of England has a favoured location with respect to the [[Azores]] high pressure when it extends its influence north-eastwards towards the UK, particularly in summer. [[Convective]] cloud often forms inland however, especially near hills, reducing the number of hours of sunshine. The average annual sunshine totals around 1,600&nbsp;hours.<ref name="weather"/>

Rainfall tends to be associated with Atlantic [[Low pressure area|depressions]] or with convection. The Atlantic depressions are more vigorous in autumn and winter and most of the rain which falls in those seasons in the south-west is from this source. Average rainfall is about {{convert|725|mm|in|}}. November to March have the highest mean wind speeds, with June to August having the lightest winds. The predominant wind direction is from the south-west.<ref name="weather"/>
