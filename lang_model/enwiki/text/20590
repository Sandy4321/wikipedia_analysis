The '''Raid at Cabanatuan''' was a rescue of [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] prisoners of war (POWs) and civilians from a Japanese camp near [[Cabanatuan City]], in the Philippines. On January&nbsp;30, 1945, during World War II, [[United States Army Rangers]], [[Alamo Scouts]], and [[Filipino people|Filipino]] [[guerrilla warfare|guerrillas]] liberated more than 500 from the [[POW camp]].

After the surrender of tens of thousands of American troops during the [[Battle of Bataan]], many were sent to a Cabanatuan prison camp following the [[Bataan Death March]]. The Japanese transferred most of the prisoners to other areas, leaving just over 500&nbsp;American and other Allied POWs and civilians in the prison. Facing brutal conditions including disease, torture, and malnourishment, the prisoners feared they would all be executed as General [[Douglas MacArthur]] and his American forces returned to [[Luzon]]. In late January 1945, a plan was developed by [[Sixth United States Army|Sixth Army]] leaders and Filipino guerrillas to send a small force to rescue the prisoners. A group of over a hundred Rangers and Scouts and several hundred guerrillas traveled {{convert|30|mi|km|abbr=off}} behind Japanese lines to reach the camp.

In a nighttime raid, under the cover of darkness and a distraction by a [[P-61 Black Widow]], the group surprised the Japanese forces in and around the camp. Hundreds of Japanese troops were killed in the 30-minute coordinated attack; the Americans suffered minimal casualties. The Rangers, Scouts, and guerrillas escorted the POWs back to American lines. The rescue allowed the prisoners to tell of the death march and prison camp atrocities, which sparked a new rush of resolve for the war against Japan. The rescuers were awarded commendations by MacArthur, and were also recognized by President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]]. A memorial now sits on the site of the former camp, and the events of the raid have been depicted in several films.

== Background ==
{{Main|Battle of Bataan|Bataan Death March}}
After the United States was [[Attack on Pearl Harbor|attacked at Pearl Harbor]] on December&nbsp;7, 1941 by Japanese forces, it entered World War II to join the [[Allies of World War II|Allied forces]] in their fight against the [[Axis powers]]. American forces led by General [[Douglas MacArthur]], already stationed in the Philippines as a deterrent against a Japanese invasion of the islands, were [[Philippines Campaign (1941<U+2013>1942)|attacked by the Japanese]] hours after Pearl Harbor. On March&nbsp;12, 1942, General MacArthur and a few select officers, on the orders of President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]], left the American forces, promising to return with reinforcements. The 72,000&nbsp;American and Filipino soldiers, fighting with outdated weapons, lacking supplies, and stricken with disease and malnourishment, eventually surrendered to the Japanese on April 9, 1942.<ref name="Breuer 31">{{harvnb|Breuer|1994|p=31}}</ref>

The Japanese had initially planned for only 10,000&ndash;25,000&nbsp;American and Filipino prisoners of war (POWs). Although they had organized two&nbsp;hospitals, ample food, and guards for this estimate, they were overwhelmed with over 72,000&nbsp;prisoners.<ref name="Breuer 31">{{harvnb|Breuer|1994|p=31}}</ref><ref name="McRaven 245">{{harvnb|McRaven|1995|p=245}}</ref> By the end of the 60-mile (97-km) march, only 52,000&nbsp;prisoners (approximately 9,200&nbsp;American and 42,800&nbsp;Filipino) reached [[Camp O'Donnell]], with an estimated 20,000 having died from illness, hunger, torture, or murder.<ref name="McRaven 245"/><ref name="Shoot24:52">{{Cite episode|title=WWII: Raid on the Bataan Death Camp|series=Shootout!|serieslink=Shootout!|network=[[History (TV channel)|History Channel]]|airdate=December&nbsp;1, 2006|season=2|number=5|minutes=24:52}}</ref><ref name="Breuer 40">{{harvnb|Breuer|1994|p=40}}</ref> Some of the imprisoned soldiers were diverted to the Cabanatuan prison camp to join the POWs from the [[Battle of Corregidor]].<ref name="Parkinson 121">{{harvnb|Parkinson|2006|p=121}}</ref>

Multiple escape attempts were made throughout the history of the prison camp, but the majority ended in failure. In one attempt, four&nbsp;soldiers were recaptured by the Japanese.

As American forces continued to approach Luzon, the Japanese Imperial High Command ordered that all able-bodied POWs be transported to Japan. From the Cabanatuan camp, over 1,600 soldiers were removed in October&nbsp;1944, leaving over 500&nbsp;sick, weak, or disabled POWs.<ref name="Breuer 137">{{harvnb|Breuer|1994|p=137}}</ref><ref name="Breuer 144">{{harvnb|Breuer|1994|p=144}}</ref><ref name="Sides 202">{{harvnb|Sides|2001|p=202}}</ref> On January&nbsp;6, 1945, all of the guards withdrew from the Cabanatuan camp, leaving the POWs alone.<ref name="Breuer 1401">{{harvnb|Breuer|1994|pp=140<U+2013>141}}</ref> The guards had previously told prisoner leaders that they should not attempt to escape, else suffer the consequence of being killed.<ref name="Sides 2378">{{harvnb|Sides|2001|pp=237<U+2013>238}}</ref> When the guards left, the prisoners heeded the threat, fearing that the Japanese were waiting near the camp and would use the attempted escape as an excuse to execute them all.<ref name="Sides 2378"/> Instead, the prisoners went to the guards' side of the camp and ransacked the Japanese buildings for supplies and large amounts of food.<ref name="Breuer 1401"/> Prisoners were alone for several weeks, except when retreating Japanese forces would periodically stay in the camp. The soldiers mainly ignored the POWs, except to ask for food. Although aware of the consequences, the prisoners sent a small group outside the prison's gates to bring in two&nbsp;[[carabao]]s to slaughter.

== Planning and preparation ==
On October&nbsp;20, 1944, General [[Douglas MacArthur]]'s forces [[Battle of Leyte|landed on Leyte]], paving the way for the [[Philippines campaign, 1944-45|liberation of the Philippines]]. Several months later, as the Americans consolidated their forces to prepare for the main invasion of [[Luzon]], nearly [[Palawan#The Palawan Massacre|150&nbsp;Americans were executed]] by their Japanese captors on December&nbsp;14, 1944 in a POW camp on the island of [[Palawan]]. These Americans were herded into [[Air-raid shelter|air raid shelters]], sealed in, doused with gasoline, and burned alive.<ref name="SanJoseNews"/> One of the survivors, [[Private First Class|PFC]] Eugene Nielsen, recounted his tale to U.S. Army Intelligence on January&nbsp;7, 1945.<ref name="Sides 12">{{harvnb|Sides|2001|p=12}}</ref> Two days later, MacArthur's forces landed on Luzon and began a rapid advance towards the capital, [[Manila]].<ref name="Eug52Years"/>

Major Bob Lapham, the American [[U.S. Army Forces Far East|USAFFE]] senior guerrilla chief, and another guerrilla leader, [[Juan Pajota]], had considered freeing the prisoners within the camp,<ref name="Breuer 1201">{{harvnb|Breuer|1994|pp=120<U+2013>121}}</ref> but feared logistical issues with hiding and caring for the prisoners.<ref name="Hunt 196">{{harvnb|Hunt|1986|p=196}}</ref> An earlier plan had been proposed by Lieutenant Colonel Bernard Anderson, leader of the guerrillas near the camp. He suggested that the guerrillas would secure the prisoners, escort them {{convert|50|mi|km|abbr=off}} to Debut Bay, and transport them using 30&nbsp;submarines. The plan was denied approval as MacArthur feared the Japanese would catch up with the fleeing prisoners and kill them all.<ref name="Alexander 231"/> In addition, the Navy did not have the required submarines, especially with MacArthur's upcoming invasion of Luzon.<ref name="Breuer 1201"/>

On January&nbsp;26, 1945, Lapham traveled from his location near the prison camp to [[Sixth United States Army|Sixth Army]] headquarters, {{convert|30|mi|km|abbr=off}} away.<ref name="Breuer 1489">{{harvnb|Breuer|1994|pp=148<U+2013>149}}</ref> He proposed to [[Lieutenant general (United States)|Lieutenant General]] [[Walter Krueger]]'s intelligence chief Colonel Horton White that a rescue attempt be made to liberate the estimated 500&nbsp;POWs at the Cabanatuan prison camp before the Japanese possibly killed them all.<ref name="Breuer 1489"/> Lapham estimated Japanese forces to include 100<U+2013>300&nbsp;soldiers within the camp, 1,000 across the Cabu River northeast of the camp, and possibly around 5,000 within Cabanatuan City.<ref name="Breuer 1489"/> Pictures of the camp were also available, as planes had taken surveillance images as recently as January 19.<ref name="Sides 261">{{harvnb|Sides|2001|p=261}}</ref> White estimated that the [[I Corps (United States)|I Corps]] would not reach Cabanatuan City until January 31 or February 1, and that if any rescue attempt were to be made, it would have to be on January 29.<ref name="Rottman 10">{{harvnb|Rottman|2009|p=10}}</ref> White reported the details to Krueger, who gave the order for the rescue attempt.<ref name="Breuer 1489"/>

At 11:30 on January&nbsp;30, Scouts Nellist and Pvt.

Mucci had already given Nellist's January&nbsp;29 afternoon report and forwarded it to Prince, who he entrusted to determine how to get the Rangers in and out of the compound quickly, and with as few casualties as possible. Price developed a plan, which was then modified in light of the new report from the abandoned shack reconnaissance received at 14:30.<ref name="Sides 174">{{harvnb|Sides|2001|p=174}}</ref> He proposed that the Rangers would be split into two groups: about 90&nbsp;Rangers of C Company, led by Prince, would attack the main camp and escort the prisoners out, while 30&nbsp;Rangers of a platoon from F Company, commanded by Lt. John Murphy, would signal the start of the attack by firing into various Japanese positions at the rear of the camp at 19:30.<ref name="Sides 224">{{harvnb|Sides|2001|p=224}}</ref><ref name="Breuer 165">{{harvnb|Breuer|1994|p=165}}</ref> Prince predicted that the raid would be accomplished in 30&nbsp;minutes or less. Once Prince had ensured that all of the POWs were safely out of the camp, he would fire a red flare, indicating that all troops should fall back to a meetup at Pampanga River {{convert|1.5|mi|km|abbr=off}} north of the camp where 150&nbsp;guerrillas would be ready with carabao-pulled carts to transport the POWs.<ref name="Breuer 164"/> This group would help to load the POWs and escort them back to American lines.

One of Prince's primary concerns was the flatness of the countryside. The Japanese had kept the terrain's vegetation clear to ensure that approaching guerrilla attacks could be seen as well as to spot prisoner escapes.<ref name="Rottman 25"/> Prince knew his Rangers would have to crawl through a long, open field on their bellies, right under the eyes of the Japanese guards. There would only be just over an hour of full darkness, as the sun set below the horizon and the moon rose.<ref name="Rottman 25"/> This would still present the possibility of the Japanese guards noticing their movement, especially with a nearly full moon. If the Rangers were discovered, the only planned response was for everyone to immediately stand up and rush the camp.<ref name="Sides 226">{{harvnb|Sides|2001|p=226}}</ref><ref name="Shoot3533">{{Cite episode|title=WWII: Raid on the Bataan Death Camp|series=Shootout!|serieslink=Shootout!|network=[[History (TV channel)|History Channel]]|airdate=December&nbsp;1, 2006|season=2|number=5|minutes=35:33}}</ref> The Rangers were unaware that the Japanese did not have any searchlights that could be used to illuminate the perimeter.<ref name="Rottman 27">{{harvnb|Rottman|2009|p=27}}</ref> Pajota suggested that to distract the guards, an [[United States Army Air Forces]] (USAAF) airplane should buzz the camp to divert the guards' eyes to the sky.

By dawn on January&nbsp;30, the road in front of the camp was clear of traveling Japanese troops.<ref name="Sides 168">{{harvnb|Sides|2001|p=168}}</ref> Mucci made plans to protect the POWs once they were freed from the camp. Two groups of guerrillas of the [[Robert Lapham|Luzon Guerrilla Armed Forces]], one under Pajota and another under Capt. Eduardo Joson,<ref name="Hunt 198">{{harvnb|Hunt|1986|p=198}}</ref> would be sent in opposite directions to hold the main road near the camp. Pajota and 200&nbsp;guerrillas were to set up a roadblock next to the wooden bridge over the Cabu River.<ref name="Breuer 164">{{harvnb|Breuer|1994|p=164}}</ref><ref name="Sides 176">{{harvnb|Sides|2001|p=176}}</ref> This setup, northeast of the prisoner camp, would be the first line of defense against the Japanese forces camped across the river, which would be within earshot of the assault on the camp. Joson and his 75&nbsp;guerrillas, along with a Ranger bazooka team, would set up a roadblock {{convert|800|yd|m|abbr=off}} southwest of the prisoner camp to stop any Japanese forces that would arrive from Cabanatuan.<ref name="Breuer 164"/> Both groups would each place 25 land mines in front of their positions, and one&nbsp;guerrilla from each group was given a bazooka to destroy any armored vehicles.<ref name="Breuer 164"/> After the POWs and the remainder of the attacking force had reached the Pampanga River meeting point, Prince would fire a second flare to indicate to the ambush sites to pull back (gradually, if they faced opposition) and head to Plateros.<ref name="Breuer 165"/>

As the POWs had no knowledge of the upcoming assault, they went through their normal routine that night. The previous day, two Filipino boys had thrown rocks into the prisoner side of the camp with notes attached, "Be ready to go out."<ref name="Rottman 40">{{harvnb|Rottman|2009|p=40}}</ref> Assuming that the boys were pulling a prank, the POWs disregarded the notes. The POWs were becoming more wary of the Japanese guards, believing that anytime in the next few days they could be massacred for any reason. They figured that the Japanese would not want them to be rescued by advancing American forces, regain their strength, and return to fight the Japanese again. In addition, the Japanese could kill the prisoners to prevent them from telling of the atrocities of the Bataan Death March or the conditions in the camp.<ref name="Sides 234">{{harvnb|Sides|2001|p=234}}</ref> With the limited Japanese guard, a small group of prisoners had already decided that they would make an escape attempt at about 20:00.<ref name="Breuer 166">{{harvnb|Breuer|1994|p=166}}</ref><ref name="Sides 268">{{harvnb|Sides|2001|p=268}}</ref>

At 17:00, a few hours after Mucci approved Prince's plan, the Rangers departed from Platero. White clothes were tied around their left arms to prevent friendly fire.<ref name="Rottman 43">{{harvnb|Rottman|2009|p=43}}</ref> They crossed the Pampanga River and then, at 17:45, Prince and Murphy's men parted ways to surround the camp.<ref name="Sides 224"/><ref name="Breuer 166"/> Pajota, Joson, and their guerrilla forces each headed to their ambush sites. The Rangers under Prince made their way to the main gate and stopped about {{convert|700|yd|m|abbr=off}} from the camp to wait for nightfall and the aircraft distraction.<ref name="Breuer 166"/>

Meanwhile, a [[P-61 Black Widow]] from the 547th Night Fighter Squadron had taken off at 18:00, piloted by Capt. Kenneth Schrieber and 1st Lt. Bonnie Rucks.<ref name="Sides 2480">{{harvnb|Sides|2001|pp=248<U+2013>250}}</ref> About 45&nbsp;minutes before the attack, Schrieber cut the power to the left engine at {{convert|1500|ft|m|abbr=off}} over the camp. He restarted it, creating a loud backfire, and repeated the procedure twice more, losing altitude to {{convert|200|ft|m|abbr=off}}. Pretending to be a crippled plane, Schrieber headed toward low hills, clearing them by a mere {{convert|30|ft|m|abbr=off}}. To the Japanese observers, it seemed the plane had crashed and they watched, waiting for a fiery explosion. Schrieber repeated this several times while also performing various aerobatic maneuvers. The ruse continued for twenty minutes, creating a diversion for the Rangers inching their way toward the camp on their bellies.<ref name="Sides 2480"/><ref name="Shoot3620">{{Cite episode|title=WWII: Raid on the Bataan Death Camp|series=Shootout!|serieslink=Shootout!|network=[[History (TV channel)|History Channel]]|airdate=December&nbsp;1, 2006|season=2|number=5|minutes=36:20}}</ref> Prince later commended the pilots' actions: "The idea of an aerial decoy was a little unusual and honestly, I didn't think it would work, not in a million years. But the pilot's maneuvers were so skillful and deceptive that the diversion was complete. I don't know where we would have been without it."<ref name="Sides 2480"/> As the plane buzzed the camp, Lt.

In a makeshift hospital at Plateros, Scout Alfonso and Ranger Fisher were quickly put into surgery. The shrapnel was removed from Alfonso's abdomen, and he was expected to recover if returned to American lines. Fisher's shrapnel was also removed, but with limited supplies and widespread damage to both his stomach and intestines, it was decided more extensive surgery would need to be completed in an American hospital.<ref name="Breuer 18890"/><ref name="Sides 310">{{harvnb|Sides|2001|p=310}}</ref> Mucci ordered that an airstrip be built in a field next to Plateros so that a plane could airlift him to American lines. Some Scouts and freed prisoners stayed behind to construct the airstrip.

As the group left Plateros at 22:30 to trek back towards American lines, Pajota and his guerrillas continually sought out local villagers to provide additional carabao carts to transport the weakened prisoners.<ref name="Breuer 186"/> The majority of the prisoners had little or no clothing and shoes, and it became increasingly difficult for them to walk.<ref name="Breuer 179">{{harvnb|Breuer|1994|p=179}}</ref> When the group reached Balincarin, they had accumulated nearly 50&nbsp;carts.<ref name="Breuer 191">{{harvnb|Breuer|1994|p=191}}</ref> Despite the convenience of using the carts, the carabao traveled at a sluggish pace, only {{convert|2|mph|km/h|abbr=off}}, which greatly reduced the speed of the return trip.<ref name="Breuer 187"/> By the time the group reached American lines, 106&nbsp;carts were being used.<ref name="Breuer 196">{{harvnb|Breuer|1994|p=196}}</ref>

In addition to the tired former prisoners and civilians, the majority of the Rangers had only slept for five to six hours over the past three days. The soldiers frequently had hallucinations or fell asleep as they marched. [[Benzedrine]] was distributed by the medics to keep the Rangers active during the long march.

During one leg of the return trip, the men were stopped by the [[Hukbalahap]], Filipino Communist guerrillas who hated both the Americans and the Japanese. They were also rivals to Pajota's men. One of Pajota's lieutenants conferred with the Hukbalahap and returned to tell Mucci that they were not allowed to pass through the village. Angered by the message, Mucci sent the lieutenant back to insist that pursuing Japanese forces would be coming. The lieutenant came back and told Mucci that only Americans could pass, and Pajota's men had to stay.

The raid was considered successful&mdash;489 POWs were liberated, along with 33 civilians. The total included 492&nbsp;Americans, 23&nbsp;British (including Edwin Rose), three&nbsp;Dutch, two&nbsp;Norwegians, one&nbsp;Canadian, and one&nbsp;Filipino.<ref name="Rottman 61"/> The rescue allowed the prisoners to tell of the Bataan and Corregidor atrocities, which sparked a new wave of resolve for the war against Japan.<ref name="Zedrick 199">{{harvnb|Zedrick|1995|p=199}}</ref><ref name="Johnson 264">{{harvnb|Johnson|2002|p=264}}</ref> Prince gave a great deal of credit for the success of the raid to others: "Any success we had was due not only to our efforts but to the Alamo Scouts and Air Force. The pilots (Capt. Kenneth R. Schrieber and Lt. Bonnie B. Rucks) of the plane that flew so low over the camp were incredibly brave men."<ref name="LJLiberation"/> Some of the Rangers and Scouts went on [[war bond|bond drive]] tours around the United States and also met with President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]].<ref name="Alexander 255"/><ref name="Zedrick 199"/> In 1948, the [[United States Congress]] created legislation which provided $1 (${{Inflation|US|1|1948|r=2}} today) for each day the POWs had been held in a prisoner camp, including Cabanatuan.<ref name="Breuer 211"/> Two&nbsp;years later, Congress again approved an additional $1.50 per day (a combined total of ${{Inflation|US|2.50|1950|r=2}} today).<ref name="Breuer 211"/>

Estimates of the Japanese soldiers killed during the assault ranged from 530 to 1,000.<ref name="Sides 326">{{harvnb|Sides|2001|p=326}}</ref><ref name="Zedrick 199"/> The estimates include the 73 guards and approximately 150 traveling Japanese who stayed in the camp that night, as well as those killed by Pajota's men attempting to cross the Cabu River.<ref name="King 61"/><ref name="McRaven 249">{{harvnb|McRaven|1995|p=249}}</ref><ref name="Kelly 33">{{harvnb|Kelly|1997|p=33}}</ref> Several Americans died during and after the raid.

Both Fisher and Sweezy are buried at Manila National Cemetery.

The American prisoners were quickly returned to the United States, most by plane. Those who were still sick or weakened remained at American hospitals to continue to recuperate. On February&nbsp;11, 1945, 280 POWs left Leyte aboard the transport USS ''General A.E. Anderson'' bound for [[San Francisco]] via Hollandia, [[New Guinea]].<ref name="Breuer 207">{{harvnb|Breuer|1994|p=207}}</ref> In an effort to counter the improved American morale, [[Tokyo Rose|Japanese propaganda radio announcers]] broadcasted to American soldiers that submarines, ships, and planes were hunting the ''General Anderson''.<ref name="Sides 324">{{harvnb|Sides|2001|p=324}}</ref> The threats proved to be a bluff, and the ship safely arrived in [[San Francisco Bay]] on March&nbsp;8, 1945.<ref name="Sides 329">{{harvnb|Sides|2001|p=329}}</ref>

News of the rescue was released to the public on February 2.<ref name="Rottman 56">{{harvnb|Rottman|2009|p=56}}</ref> The feat was celebrated by MacArthur's soldiers, Allied correspondents, and the American public, as the raid had touched an emotional chord among Americans concerned about the fate of the defenders of [[Bataan]] and [[Corregidor]]. Family members of the POWs were contacted by telegram to inform them of the rescue.<ref name="StTelegram"/> News of the raid was broadcast on numerous radio outlets and newspaper front pages.<ref name="Breuer 202">{{harvnb|Breuer|1994|p=202}}</ref> The Rangers and POWs were interviewed to describe the conditions of the camp, as well as the events of the raid.<ref name="Hogan 88">{{harvnb|Hogan|1992|p=88}}</ref> The enthusiasm over the raid was later overshadowed by other Pacific events, including the [[Battle of Iwo Jima|Battle for Iwo Jima]] and the dropping of the [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki]].<ref name="Johnson 264"/><ref name="Sides 328">{{harvnb|Sides|2001|p=328}}</ref> The raid was soon followed by an even more successful [[raid at Los Ba<U+00F1>os]] on February&nbsp;23 where 2,147 Allied POWs and civilian prisoners were rescued.<ref name="Alexander 270">{{harvnb|Alexander|2009|p=270}}</ref>

A Sixth Army report indicated that the raid demonstrated "&nbsp;...&nbsp;what patrols can accomplish in enemy territory by following the basic principles of scouting and patrolling, 'sneaking and peeping,' [the] use of concealment, reconnaissance of routes from photographs and maps prior to the actual operation, ... and the coordination of all arms in the accomplishment of a mission."<ref name="King 71">{{harvnb|King|1985|p=71}}</ref> MacArthur spoke about his reaction to the raid: "No incident of the campaign in the Pacific has given me such satisfaction as the release of the POWs at Cabanatuan. The mission was brilliantly successful."<ref name="O'Donnell 178">{{harvnb|O'Donnell|2003|p=178}}</ref> He presented awards to the soldiers who participated in the raid on March&nbsp;3, 1945. Although Mucci was nominated for the [[Medal of Honor]], he and Prince both received [[Distinguished Service Cross (United States)|Distinguished Service Crosses]]. Mucci was promoted to colonel and was given command of the 1st Regiment of the [[6th Infantry Division (United States)|6th Infantry Division]].<ref name="Breuer 211">{{harvnb|Breuer|1994|p=211}}</ref> All other American officers and selected enlisted received [[Silver Star]]s.<ref name="Breuer 205">{{harvnb|Breuer|1994|p=205}}</ref> The remaining American enlisted men and the Filipino guerrilla officers were awarded [[Bronze Star Medal|Bronze Stars]].<ref name="Breuer 205"/> Nellist, Rounsaville, and the other twelve Scouts received [[Presidential Unit Citation (United States)|Presidential Unit Citation]]s.<ref name="Alexander 6">{{harvnb|Alexander|2009|p=6}}</ref>

In late 1945, the bodies of the American troops who died at the camp were exhumed, and the men moved to other cemeteries.<ref name="Johnson 276">{{harvnb|Johnson|2002|p=276}}</ref> Land was donated in the late 1990s by the Filipino government to create a memorial. The site of the Cabanatuan camp is now a park that includes a memorial wall listing the 2,656 American prisoners who died there.<ref name="Sides 334">{{harvnb|Sides|2001|p=334}}</ref> The memorial was financed by former American POWs and veterans, and is maintained by the [[American Battle Monuments Commission]].<ref name="Johnson 276"/><ref name="Rottman 62"/> A joint resolution by Congress and President [[Ronald Reagan]] designated April 12, 1982 as "American Salute to Cabanatuan Prisoner of War Memorial Day".<ref name="Carson 247">{{harvnb|Carson|1997|p=247}}</ref> In Cabanatuan City, a hospital is named for guerrilla leader Eduardo Joson.<ref name="Rottman 62">{{harvnb|Rottman|2009|p=62}}</ref>

Prince, reflecting on the public reaction to the mission<ref name="Breuer 206">{{harvnb|Breuer|1994|p=206}}</ref> }}
Several films have focused on the raid, while also including archival footage of the POWs.<ref name="WarEthos"/> [[Edward Dmytryk]]'s 1945 film ''[[Back to Bataan]]'', starring [[John Wayne]], opens by retelling the story of the raid on the Cabanatuan POW camp. Based on the books ''The Great Raid on Cabanatuan'' and ''[[Ghost Soldiers]]'', the 2005 [[John Dahl]] film ''[[The Great Raid]]'' focused on the raid intertwined with a love story.  Prince served as a consultant on the film, and believed it depicted the raid accurately.<ref name="SeattlePiRP"/><ref name="SeatNative"/> [[Marty Katz]] conveyed his interest in producing the film: "This [rescue] was a massive operation that had very little chance of success. It's like a Hollywood movie&mdash;it couldn't really happen, but it did. That was why we were attracted to the material."<ref name="DailyMost"/>
