'''George William Smith''' (20 September 1874 <U+2013> 7 December 1954) was a [[New Zealand]] sportsman who excelled at track and field as well as both codes of [[rugby football]].

==Early years==
Smith was born in Auckland and educated at Wellesley Street School.

==Jockey==
George was an extremely successful jockey and won the 1894 [[New Zealand Cup]], riding Impulse. He had to abandon his racing career after gaining weight.

==Athlete==
As a track athlete, Smith was an outstanding [[Sprint (race)|sprinter]] and [[Hurdling|hurdler]], winning 15 national championships between 1898 and 1904 (100 yards sprint and 440 yards hurdles five times each and the 120 yards hurdles four times plus the 250 yards once), as well as multiple Australasian championships and the 1902 British [[Amateur Athletic Association|AAA]] [[400 metres hurdles|quarter-mile hurdles]], in which event he had an unofficial world record of 58.5s. While in Britain in 1902 [[Manningham F.C.]] tried to sign Smith to play [[rugby league]]. Smith turned down the <U+00A3>100 contract.<ref name=coffey>Coffey and Wood ''The Kiwis: 100 Years of International Rugby League'' ISBN 1-86971-090-8</ref>

==Rugby union==
Smith began his rugby career in 1895 playing [[rugby union]] for the City Rugby Club in Auckland. He first represented his home province [[Auckland Rugby Union|Auckland]] in 1896 and, in the following year made, his debut for the [[All Blacks|New Zealand national team]] against [[New South Wales]]. However, in the following years, Smith played little rugby, instead preferring to concentrate on track. He made a come back in 1901, gaining All Black selection, before disappearing again until he was enticed back to the game with the prospect of joining the '[[The Original All Blacks (1905)|Originals]]' tour to the [[British Isles]] and France in 1905.

During the Originals tour, Smith was one of the outstanding players, especially in the early part of the tour, playing in 19 games, including the internationals against [[Scotland national rugby union team|Scotland]] and [[Ireland national rugby union team|Ireland]], and scoring 19 [[try|tries]]. It was during this time in Britain that he first saw [[rugby league|Northern Union]] being played.

Altogether, Smith made 39 appearances for New Zealand in rugby union, 21 as a [[Wing (rugby union)|wing]] and 18 at [[Centre (rugby union)|centre]], and scored 34 tries.

Smith played for the City club and represented Auckland in 1906. City conducted a four game tour of Sydney after the season had ended.<ref name=akl100>Coffey, John and Bernie Wood ''Auckland, 100 years of rugby league, 1909<U+2013>2009'', 2009. ISBN 978-1-86969-366-4, p.3.</ref>

==Rugby league==
While in Sydney with the City club Smith met an Australian entrepreneur, [[J J Giltinan|James Giltinan]], and discussed the potential of professional rugby in [[Australasia]].<ref name=akl100/> Smith is reported to have told Giltinan "What about you gettings Rugby League going in Australia, and I'll do my best when I cross the Tasman home."<ref name=book>John Haynes ''From All Blacks to All Golds: Rugby League's Pioneers'', Christchurch, Ryan and Haynes, 1996. ISBN 0-473-03864-1</ref> He then met [[Albert Baskiville]] in Wellington and played a leading part in the formation of the professional [[1907-1908 New Zealand rugby tour of Great Britain]], helping to select the touring party. At the time Smith was probably the best known athlete in New Zealand and his involvement in the tour lent it credibility and increased its ability to attract players. Smith was elected vice-captain and the tour was a success, both financially and on the field, with the team winning its three match series against [[Great Britain national rugby league team|Great Britain]]. Smith later described the tour as the happiest one he had ever been associated with.<ref name=book />

After touring with the professional All Blacks he stayed on in Britain to play professionally with the [[Oldham Roughyeds|Oldham]] club, signing a <U+00A3>150 contract. This gave Smith the financial freedom he had been seeking and he bought his fiance over from New Zealand to join him in Oldham.<ref name=book /> At the end of the [[1908<U+2013>09 Northern Rugby Football Union season]] Smith played on the wing in Oldham's loss to [[Wigan Warriors|Wigan]] in the [[Rugby Football League Championship|Championship]] Final.<ref>{{cite web|title=1908<U+2013>1909 Championship Final|url=http://wigan.rlfans.com/fusion_pages/index.php?page_id=414|work=cherryandwhite.co.uk|publisher=wigan.rlfans.com|accessdate=3 January 2012}}</ref> By 1912 Smith had moved into the forwards and played at second row.<ref name=coffey /> Smith played for the club until 1916 when a broken leg ended his career.

==Later life==
Smith then joined a textile firm but in 1932 returned to rugby league, being involved in the [[Oldham Roughyeds|Oldham]] coaching staff for three years. He often met touring [[New Zealand Kiwis|New Zealand League]] and [[All Blacks]] sides.

He lived in Oldham until his death on 7 December 1954.

His son, George Smith, played both rugby codes and died in a Japanese prisoner camp in 1943.
