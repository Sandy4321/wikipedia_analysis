==Plot==
Berchmans ([[Arjun Sarja|Arjun]]), a brilliant but unruly student, is thrown out of his seminary for committing the sin of the flesh after being caught red-handed by fellow student Sam Fernando ([[Arvind Swamy|Arvind Swami]]). Blaming the good-hearted Sam for his ouster, Berchmans vows revenge and challenges to prove that evil does reign supreme in this world. Sam finishes his education and training and arrives at a village as the new Father of the local church. A local boy named Thomas of this village who is the illegitimate son of a local fisherman ([[Ponvannan]]) has grown up in a rough neighbourhood, following the death of his mother and thus being forced to fend for himself.

Father Sam takes the run down church and the sceptic villagers in his stride and soon starts bringing about changes. Through a series of incidents, he also manages to get the unruly Thomas under his control and gets him to learn the tricks of the fishing trade from the villagers. The film fast forwards a few years when Thomas is now all grown up ([[Gautham Karthik]]) and is very close to Father Sam who is now a well respected person in the village.

Thomas comes across Bea (short for Beatrice) ([[Thulasi Nair]]) when she's running away from her convent school group who had gotten her admitted to hospital. They keep running into each other a few times and Thomas comes to like her presence.

Meanwhile, as Father Sam is meditating on the remote beach, he hears a few gunshots on the sands. On investigation, he finds an unconscious Berchmans in the waters. On seeing that the shooters are still lurking around trying to finish their job of killing Berchmans, he pulls him to safety into an abandoned ship, and takes care of his bullet injuries with the help of a local village woman as well as a woman from a distant village that Berchmans asks him to get. A few villagers including Ponvannan who see Father Sam running around in the dark with the 2 women get suspicious and accuse the three of sleeping together. They call the Bishop, upon whose interrogation, the woman that Berchmans had invited admits to the sin, and Father Sam gets unfairly implicated. One of the villagers also gets killed in the ensuing m<U+00EA>l<U+00E9>e and Father Sam gets sentenced to 4 years rigorous imprisonment.

Berchmans visits Father Sam in prison and admits he got the woman to implicate him falsely, to prove that evil will always triumph. When Father Sam returns from prison, he discovers Thomas has fallen in cahoots with the evil Berchmans in his smuggling trade and has committed many sins in his desire to make the village people bow before him. Thomas and Bea have also fallen in love with each other and come to seek Father Sam's blessings. Thomas subsequently gets to know that Bea is none other than the estranged daughter of Berchmans, who does not want to have to do anything with her.

Thomas takes Bea to Berchmans' house to trigger some long-lost memories when she recalls all the previous horrific incidents of her father Berchmans, including the one of killing her mother. Berchmans gets angry with all this and abducts both Father Sam and Bea in his boat and goes out to sea with an intent to kill them both. However even after a few feeble attempts, the self-professed son of Satan who disavows all family attachment, is unable to get himself to kill his daughter. Thomas comes chasing them and after a long drawn fight amongst the three, Thomas and Father Sam together manage to subdue the evil Bergmans.

The movie ends on a note that good finally triumphs over evil, whether it be Father Sam and Thomas' triumph over Berchmans, Thomas' own suppressing of his bad inclination and re-joining forces with Father Sam, or Berchmans' good nature coming out in his inability to kill his daughter.

===Development===
During a press meet in December 2009, actor [[Karthik (actor)|Karthik]] revealed that his son, [[Gautham Karthik]] would make his debut in [[Mani Ratnam]]'s next venture post completion of Ratnam's bilingual films ''[[Raavan]]'' and ''[[Raavanan]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.indiaglitz.com/channels/tamil/article/52468.html |title=Mani Ratnam to launch Karthik's son! <U+2013> Tamil Movie News |publisher=IndiaGlitz |accessdate=2012-03-24}}</ref> In July 2010, reports emerged that the film was titled as ''Pookkadai''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.indiaglitz.com/channels/tamil/article/58490.html |title=Mani's next 'Pookkadai'? <U+2013> Tamil Movie News |publisher=IndiaGlitz |accessdate=2012-03-24}}</ref> Mani Ratnam stopped pre-production work on the film in late 2010 and moved on to plan a big-budget historical project titled ''Ponniyin Selvan'', but months later was forced to shelve it due to financial issues. Later, owing to the speculated title of the former project, the team was unable to name the film ''Pookkadai'' as an aspiring director had already registered the name in 2007. Finally the working project was renamed as ''Kadal'' in February 2012.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.indiaglitz.com/channels/tamil/article/76897.html |title=It's not 'Pookadai' for Mani! <U+2013> Tamil Movie News |publisher=IndiaGlitz |accessdate=2012-03-24}}</ref>
When Mani Ratnam  had finished ''[[Raavanan]]'' (2010), [[Jeyamohan]] started writing a 200-page novel for ''Kadal'', which was later transformed by Mani Ratnam into a screenplay.<ref name=jeyhindu>{{cite news|title=Sea of imagination|url=http://www.thehindu.com/life-and-style/metroplus/sea-of-imagination/article4365144.ece|accessdate=31 January 2013|newspaper=The Hindu|date=31 January 2013}}</ref> Jeyamohan was signed to be a part of the script-writing team for the film in August 2011, while [[Rajiv Menon]] was also confirmed as cinematographer for the film, reuniting with Mani Ratnam after the successes of ''[[Bombay (film)|Bombay]]'' and ''[[Guru (2007 film)|Guru]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.behindwoods.com/tamil-movie-news-1/aug-11-03/mani-rathnam-rajiv-menon-19-08-11.html |title=More on Mani Ratnam's Next <U+2013> Mani Ratnam <U+2013> Rajiv Menon <U+2013> Tamil Movie News |publisher=Behindwoods.com |date=19 August 2011 |accessdate=2012-03-24}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2011-08-04/news-interviews/29850163_1_mani-ratnam-mani-sir-love-story |title=A love story for Mani? |work=The Times of India |date= 4 August 2011|accessdate=2012-03-24}}</ref> As the film portrays Christianity, Rajiv Menon explored the way artistes capture biblical themes. For this he and Ratnam went through [[Simon Schama]]'s documentary called [[Simon Schama's Power of Art|Power of Art]] on [[Michelangelo Merisi da Caravaggio|Caravaggio]]. For the outdoor shootings they stuck to the contemporary way. Mani Ratnam's reconnaissance for the film, the process of designing the look was done when his assistants brought back hundreds of pictures after jaunting through the entire coastline of the state [[Tamil Nadu]], including [[Rameswaram]].<ref name=rmnn/>

However, actress [[Radha (actress)|Radha]], mother of Thulasi, defended stating "As I did Bharathiraja's film ''[[Alaigal Oivathillai]]'', I was aged sixteen. There is a unique style and limitations directors have. They give proper directions to artistes.

Lingusamy's own production company Thirupathi Brothers had purchased the distribution rights of Mani Ratnam's ''Kadal'' for [[Chennai]], [[Madurai]] and [[Coimbatore]] prior to the release of the movie. To the controversies over film, in a press release dated 2 March 2013, the distributor, on a positive note stated that he would never demand compensation for the losses incurred over acquiring ''Kadal'''s distribution rights. He assured that neither he nor anyone from his office would press Mani Ratnam for compensation of monetary losses incurred over ''Kadal'' at any point of time.<ref name="verd"/>

As per the proceedings of Madras High Court it was learnt that Mannan, one of the distributors for the film and his men issued false statements to let down the reputations of the director. With no basis and intentions to extort money from his clients, the distributor and some miscreants trespassed into Ratnam<U+2019>s office and abused the staff. On March 14, 2013, the judge was passed interim orders on an application arising out of a civil suit from the director and his wife. The suit claimed for a direction to Mannan to pay {{INR}}5 crore towards the damages.<ref name=prd>{{cite web |url=http://newindianexpress.com/cities/chennai/article1500369.ece |title=Mani Ratnam gets HC relief on <U+2018>Kadal<U+2019>|publisher=''[[The New Indian Express]]''|author=Express News Service ([[Chennai]])|date=14 March 2013 |accessdate=17 March 2013}}</ref>
