'''''Limacia cockerelli''''' is a [[species]] of sea [[slug]], a dorid [[nudibranch]], a shell-less [[marine (ocean)|marine]] [[opisthobranch]] [[gastropod]] [[mollusk]] in the family [[Polyceridae]].<ref name="Bouchet">Bouchet P. & Rocroi J.-P.

== Distribution ==
This species is found from the West coast of [[North America]] ranging from [[Vancouver Island]], [[British Columbia]], [[Canada]] to [[Baja, California]]. It has also been found in and has also been found in the Gulf of California at Bahia de Los Angeles.<ref>http://www.seaslugforum.net/factsheet.cfm?base=lailcock</ref>

==Description==
This species reaches lengths of 26mm. It has long dorsal papillae with white branchial plumes.<ref>http://slugsite.us/bow/nudwk451.htm</ref> It is found in two forms. The northern form has white tubercles down the middle of the dorsum. The second form, found in areas south of [[Point Conception]] have tubercles that are slightly longer and tipped with orange. Intermediate forms exist in central and northern California. Another form in California has large red blotches on the dorsum. The eggs of the ''Limacia cockerelli'' are pink and develop after 17 days, (at 10-13 degrees C), into into hatching planktotrophic veligers.

==Diet==
This animal preys exclusively on the orange-brown colored [[bryozoan]]s, [[Hincksina velata]] and [[Membranopora]].
