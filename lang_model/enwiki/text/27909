'''Edom''' ({{Hebrew Name|<U+05D0><U+05B1><U+05D3><U+05D5><U+05B9><U+05DD>|Edom|<U+02BE><U+0114><U+1E0F><U+00F4>m|"[[red]]"}}) is a name given to [[Esau]] in the [[Hebrew Bible]], as well as to the nation descending from him.  The nation's name in [[Assyrian language|Assyrian]] was '''Udumi'''; in [[Syriac language|Syriac]], '''<U+0710><U+0715><U+0718><U+0721>'''; in [[Greek language|Greek]], '''<U+1F38><U+03B4><U+03BF><U+03C5><U+03BC><U+03B1><U+03AF><U+03B1>''' (Idouma<U+00ED>a); in [[Latin]], '''Idum<U+00E6>a''' or '''Idumea'''.

The Edomite people were a [[Semitic languages|Semitic]]-speaking tribal group inhabiting the [[Negev Desert]] and the [[Aravah]] valley of what is now southern [[Israel]] and adjacent [[Jordan]]. The region has much reddish sandstone, which may have given rise to the name "Edom".  The nation of Edom is known to have existed back to the [[8th century BC|8th]] or [[9th century BC]]E, and the Bible dates it back several centuries further.  Recent archeological evidence may indicate an Edomite nation as long ago as the [[11th century BC]]E, but the topic is controversial.  The nation ceased to exist with the [[Jewish-Roman Wars]].

==The Edomites==

The Edomites           may have been connected with the [[Shasu]] and [[Shutu]], nomadic raiders mentioned in [[Ancient Egypt|Egypt]]ian sources. Indeed, a letter from an Egyptian scribe at a border fortress in the [[Wadi Tumilat]] during the reign of [[Merneptah]] reports movement of nomadic "shasu-tribes of Edom" to watering holes in Egyptian territory.<ref>Redford, ''Egypt, Canaan and Israel in Ancient Times'', Princeton Univ. Press, 1992. p.228, 318.</ref>

===In the Bible===

The Bible identifies Esau as the twin brother (though not an identical twin) of Jacob, the grandson of [[Abraham]].  Jacob became the father of the [[Israelites]] after God (Genesis 35:10) renamed Jacob "Israel."  Thus Esau shared his mother's womb together with the founder of the nation of [[Israel]]. <ref name=Tebes1> Juan Manuel Tebes. (2006) "You Shall Not Abhor an Edomite, for He is Your Brother": The Tradition of Esau and the Edomite Genealogies from an Anthropological Perspective, ''Journal of Hebrew Scriptures'' 6/6 [http://www.arts.ualberta.ca/JHS/Articles/article_56.pdf Free access]</ref> See Genesis Chapter 25.  <ref>http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?book_id=1&chapter=25&version=49&context=chapter</ref>  Although Esau was Isaac's first-born entitled to inherit Isaac's wealth and blessing, Esau sold his birthright to his younger brother Jacob (Israel).  The descendants of Esau and Israel led divergent paths while the Israelites spent approximately 400 years in Egypt before returning to the land of Canaan in modern-day Israel.  Thus, the Edomites laid claim to having established kings and a kingdom long before the Israelites.

The Bible explains the name "Edom" with no mention of red rock.  It refers to the Edomites as descendants of [[Esau]], and the [[Book of Genesis]] mentions "red" a number of times in describing Esau and explaining his alternate name Edom. "The first one [Esau] came out '''reddish''' [''admoni'' in [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]]], as hairy as a fur coat. They named him Esau."<ref>Genesis 25:25, [http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&BOOK=1&CHAPTER=25 ORT translation], material in brackets added.</ref>  Years later, "[[Jacob]] was once simmering a stew, when Esau came home exhausted from the field. Esau said to Jacob, 'Give me a swallow of that '''red stuff''' [''ha-adom, ha-adom'', i.e., using the word ''ha-adom'' twice -- this is normal in Hebrew] I'm famished!' He was therefore given the name ''Edom'' ['Red' or 'Ruddy']" <ref>Genesis 25:29-30, [http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&BOOK=1&CHAPTER=25 ORT translation], material in brackets added.</ref> (see also ''[[retroactive nomenclature]]'').

The Edomites' original country, according to the [[Tanakh]], stretched from the [[Sinai Peninsula|Sinai]] peninsula as far as [[Kadesh Barnea]]. Southward it reached as far as [[Aqaba|Eilat]], which was the seaport of Edom.<ref>[[Deuteronomy|Deut.]] 1:2; 2:1-8</ref> On the north of Edom was the territory of [[Moab]].<ref>[[Book of Judges|Judges]] 11:17-18; [[Books of Kings|II Kings]] 3:8-9</ref> The boundary between Moab and Edom was the [[Wadi Zered]].<ref>Deut. 2:13-18</ref> The ancient capital of Edom was [[Bozrah]]<ref>[[Genesis|Gen.]] 36:33; [[Book of Isaiah|Isa.]] 34:6, 63:1, et al.</ref> According to Genesis, Esau's descendants settled in this land after displacing the [[Horites]]. It was also called the land of [[Seir]]; [[Mount Seir]] appears to have been strongly identified with them and may have been a cultic site. In the time of [[Amaziah]] (838 BCE), [[Selah]] ([[Petra]]) was its principal stronghold;<ref>II Kings 14:7</ref> Eilat and [[Ezion-geber]] its [[seaport]]s.<ref>I Kings 9:26</ref>  

Genesis 36 chronicles Esau's family and the kings of Edom:

<blockquote>These are the kings who ruled in the land of Edom before a king ruled the children of Israel. And [[Bela ben Beor]] ruled in Edom, and the name of his city was [[Dinhabah]]. And Bela died, and [[Jobab ben Zerah]] from Bozrah ruled in his place. And Jobab died, and [[Husham (Edomite king)|Husham]] of the land of Temani ruled in his place. And Husham died, and [[Hadad ben Bedad]], who struck [[Midian]] in the field of [[Moab]], ruled in his place, and the name of his city was [[Avith]]. And Hadad died, and [[Samlah of Masrekah]] ruled in his place. And Samlah died, and [[Saul (Edomite king)|Saul of Rehoboth on the river]] ruled in his place. And Saul died, and [[Baal-hanan ben Achbor]] ruled in his place. And Baal-hanan ben Achbor died, and [[Hadar (Edomite king)|Hadar]] ruled in his place, and the name of his city was [[Pau (Edom)|Pau]], and his wife's name was Mehetabel bat Matred bat Mezahab. And these are the names of the [[clan]]s of Esau by their families, by their places, by their names: clan [[Timnah]], clan [[Alvah]], clan [[Jetheth]], clan [[Aholibamah]], clan [[Elah (Edom)|Elah]], clan [[Pinon (Edom)|Pinon]], clan [[Kenaz]], clan [[Teman (Edom)|Teman]], clan [[Mibzar]], clan [[Magdiel]], clan [[Iram]].<ref>Genesis 36:31-43</ref></blockquote>

The Hebrew word translated as "clan" is ''[[aluf]]'', also translated as "chief", "general", or "duke", and used in this sense only in connection with Edom and Hori.<ref>{{Strong|441}}</ref> (Since 1948 it has been used for senior ranks in the [[Israeli Defense Force]]).

If the account may be taken at face value, the kingship of Edom was, at least in early times, not [[hereditary kingship|hereditary]],<ref>{{cite web | last = Gordon | first = Bruce R. | title = Edom (Idumaea) | work = Regnal Chronologies | url = http://ellone-loire.net/obsidian/Holyland.html#Edom | accessdate =  2006-08-04}}</ref> perhaps [[elective kingship|elective]].<ref name=JEnc>{{cite encyclopedia | title = Edom, Idumaea | encyclopedia = The Jewish Encyclopedia | volume = 3 | pages = 40-41 | author = [[Richard Gottheil]], [[Max Seligsohn]] | publisher = Funk and Wagnalls | date = 1901-1906 | id = LCCN:16014703 | url = http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view_page.jsp?artid=45&letter=E&pid=1 | accessdate =  2005-07-25}}</ref> First Chronicles mentions both a king and [[tribal chief|chieftain]]s.<ref> [[Books of Chronicles|I Chron.]] 1:43-54</ref> When the King of Edom refused to allow the children of Israel <ref>[[Book of Numbers|Numbers]] 20:19 King James Version 1611</ref> to pass through his land on their way to [[Canaan]], they detoured around the country because of his show of force<ref>Num. 20:14-21</ref> or because God ordered them to do so rather than wage war<ref>Deut. 2:4-6</ref>.

Nothing further is recorded of the Edomites in the Tanakh until their defeat by [[King Saul]] of Israel in the late 1000s BCE. Forty years later [[King David]] and his general [[Joab]] defeated the Edomites in the "valley of salt," (probably near the [[Dead Sea]]).<ref>[[Book of Samuel|II Sam.]] 8:13-14; I Kings 9:15-16</ref> An Edomite prince named Hadad escaped and fled to [[Egypt]], and after David's death returned and tried to start a rebellion, but failed and went to Syria.<ref>ib. 9:14-22; [[Josephus]], ''[[Jewish Antiquities]]'' viii. 7, S 6</ref> From that time Edom remained a [[vassal]] of Israel. David placed over the Edomites Israelite governors or prefects <ref>II Sam. 8:14,</ref> and this form of government seems to have continued under [[Solomon]]. When Israel divided into two kingdoms Edom became a dependency of the [[Kingdom of Judah]]. In the time of [[Jehoshaphat]] (c. 914 BCE) the Tanakh mentions a [[king of Edom]],<ref>II Kings 3:9-26</ref> who was probably an Israelite appointed by the [[King of Judah]]. It also states<ref>II Chron. 20:10-23</ref> that the inhabitants of Mount Seir invaded Judea in conjunction with Ammon and Moab, and that the invaders turned against one another and were all destroyed. Edom revolted against [[Jehoram]] and elected a king of its own.<ref>II Kings 8:20-22; II Chron. 21:8</ref> [[Amaziah]] attacked and defeated the Edomites, seizing Selah, but the Israelites never subdued Edom completely.<ref>II Kings 14:7; [[Books of Chronicles|II Chron.]] 25:11-12</ref>  

In the time of [[Nebuchadnezzar II]] the Edomites helped plunder Jerusalem and slaughter the Jews.<ref>[[Psalms|Ps.]] 137:7; [[Book of Obadiah|Obad.]] 11-14</ref> For this reason the Prophets denounced Edom violently.<ref>Isa. 34:5-8; [[Book of Jeremiah|Jer.]] 49:7-22; [[Obadiah]] ''passim''</ref>

Although the Idumaeans controlled the lands to the east and south of the Dead Sea, their peoples were held in contempt by the Israelites. Hence the [[Psalms|Book of Psalms]] says "Moab is my washpot: over Edom will I cast out my shoe".<ref>[[Psalms]] 60:8 & 108:9</ref>  According to the [[Torah]],<ref>Deut. 23:8-9</ref> the congregation could not receive descendants of a marriage between an Israelite and an Edomite until the fourth generation. This law was a subject of controversy between [[Shimon ben Yohai]], who said it applied only to male descendants, and other [[Talmud]]ists, who said female descendants were also excluded.<ref>[[Yevamot]] 76b</ref>

===Economy===

The Kingdom of Edom drew much of its livelihood from the caravan trade between Egypt, the [[Levant]], [[Mesopotamia]], and southern [[Arabia]], along the [[Incense]] Route. <ref name=Tebes2> Juan Manuel Tebes. (2007) Centro y periferia en el mundo antiguo. El Negev y sus interacciones con Egipto, Asiria, y el Levante en la Edad del Hierro (1200-586 a.C.) CEHAO Monograph Series Vol. 1 [http://www.uca.edu.ar/esp/sec-ffilosofia/esp/docs-institutos/s-cehao/otras_public/tebes_monog.pdf Free access]</ref> Astride the [[King's Highway (ancient)|King's Highway]], the Edomites were one of several states in the region for whom trade was vital due to the scarcity of arable land. It is also said that sea routes traded as far away as [[India]], with ships leaving from the port of [[Ezion-Geber]].  Edom's location on the southern highlands left it with only a small strip of land that received sufficient rain for farming.{{Fact|date=February 2007}}

Edom probably exported [[salt]] and [[balsam]] (used for perfume and [[temple]] incense in the ancient world) from the [[Dead Sea]] region.{{Fact|date=February 2007}}

===Post-Biblical Times===
[[Image:Edom.PNG|left|thumb|200px|Map showing kingdom of Edom (in red) at its largest extent, c. 600 BCE. Areas in dark red show the approximate boundary of classical-age Idumaea.]]
Edom is mentioned in [[Assyria]]n [[Cuneiform script|cuneiform]] inscriptions in the form ''"Udumi"'' or ''"Udumu"''; three of its kings are known from the same source: [[<U+1E32>aus-malaka]] at the time of [[Tiglath-pileser III]] (c. 745 BCE), [[Malik-rammu]] at the time of [[Sennacherib]] (c. 705 BCE), and [[<U+1E32>aus-gabri]] at the time of [[Esarhaddon]] (c. 680 BCE). According to the Egyptian inscriptions, the "Aduma" at times extended their possessions to the borders of Egypt.<ref>M<U+00FC>ller, ''Asien und Europa,'' p. 135.</ref> After the conquest of Judah by the [[Babylonians]], the Edomites were allowed to settle in the region south of [[Hebron]]. They prospered in this new country, called by the Greeks and Romans "Idumaea" or "Idumea", for more than four centuries.<ref>[[Gospel of Mark|Mark]] 3:8; Ptolemy, "Geography," v. 16</ref> At the same time they were driven by the [[Nabat<U+00E6>ans]] from their ancestral lands to the south and east. 

During the revolt of the [[Maccabees]] against the [[Seleucid]] kingdom, [[II Maccabees]] refers to a Seleucid general named [[Gorgias (general)|Gorgias]] as "Governor of Idumaea"; whether he was a Greek or a [[Hellenistic civilization|Hellenized]] Edomite is unknown.<ref>II Maccabees 12:32</ref> Some scholars maintain that the reference to Idumaea in that passage is an error altogether. [[Judas Maccabeus]] conquered their territory for a time in around 163 BCE.<ref>Josephus, "Ant." xii. 8, <U+00A7><U+00A7> 1, 6</ref> They were again subdued by [[John Hyrcanus]] (c. 125 BCE), who forced them to observe [[Jewish]] [[halakha|rites and laws]].<ref>ib. xiii. 9, <U+00A7> 1; xiv. 4, <U+00A7> 4</ref> They were then incorporated with the Jewish nation.<ref name=JEnc/>

The Hasmonean official [[Antipater the Idumaean]] was of Edomite origin. He was the progenitor of the [[Herodian Dynasty]] that ruled [[Judea]] after the Roman conquest. Under [[Herod the Great]] Idumaea was ruled for him by a series of governors, among whom were his brother [[Joseph ben Antipater]] and his brother-in-law [[Costobarus]].

Immediately before the siege of [[Jerusalem]] by [[Titus]], 20,000 Idumaeans, under the leadership of John, Simeon, Phinehas, and Jacob, appeared before Jerusalem to fight in behalf of the [[Zealots]] who were besieged in the [[Temple of Jerusalem|Temple]].<ref>Josephus, ''[[Jewish Wars]]'' iv. 4, <U+00A7> 5</ref>

After the Jewish Wars the Idumaeans ceased to be a separate people, though the geographical name "Idumea" still existed at the time of [[St. Jerome]].<ref name=JEnc/>

===Edomite religion===

The nature of Edomite religion is largely unknown. As close relatives of other [[Canaanites|Levantine Semites]], they may have worshipped such gods as [[El (god)|El]], [[Baal]], and [[Asherah]]. A national god named [[Kaus]] or Qos.<ref>Encyclopedia Britannica, "Edom," vol. III</ref>

===Identification with Rome===

Later in Jewish history, the [[Roman Empire]] came to be identified with Esau and "Edom". In mediaeval [[rabbinic]] writing, "Edom" is used to refer to the [[Byzantine Empire]] and [[Christendom]] in general (cf. the use of "[[Ishmael]]" to refer to the [[Islamic]] world). See extended discussion of this subject under [[Esau]].

==Controversy==

For over a century, archeologists specializing in the [[Middle East]] maintained that there was no evidence of an organized state society in Edom earlier than the 800s or 700s BCE. [[The Bible and history|Biblical minimalists]] touted this fact as one piece of evidence of the Bible's ultimate unreliability as a historical source.<ref>Redford 305.</ref>

Recently, however, excavations such as the 2004-2004 [[UCSD]] dig at Khirbat an-Nahas, part of the Jabal Hamrat Fidan (JHF) Archaeological Project, in Jordan have shed new light on the history of Edom, unearthing artifacts and evidence of settled state society as early as the  tenth century BCE,[http://www.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?pagename=JPost/JPArticle/ShowFull&cid=1108956311513 1] [http://ucsdnews.ucsd.edu/newsrel/soc/EDOM.asp 2]), although whether and to what extent these sites reflect Edomite statehood is debated.[http://www.wadiarabahproject.man.ac.uk/opening/titlepage/news/Antiquity/WAP%20review.htm 3]
Thomas E. Levy, among other scholars, concluded from a survey of the an-Nahas site that Edom was a sophisticated, urbanized society as early as the eleventh century BCE, (the date of the first Israelite monarchy, according to the Bible) which even had its own copper works.<ref>Levy, Thomas E. and [[Mohammed Najjar]]. "Edom and Copper." ''[[Biblical Archaeology Review]]''. July/August, 2006.</ref> Radiocarbon tests from the site have confirmed that the industrial areas of the site date to the eleventh and tenth centuries BCE.<ref>''Ibid., but see http://www.wadiarabahproject.man.ac.uk/opening/titlepage/news/Antiquity/WAP%20review.htm '' and E. van der Steen/P. Bienkowski. (2006) 'How Old is the Kingdom of Edom? A Review of New Evidence and Recent Discussion'. ''Antiguo Oriente'' 4: 11-20</ref>
