'''Frisco 4003''' is a [[2-8-2]], Mikado type, [[standard gauge]] [[steam railway locomotive]] built by the [[American Locomotive Company]] in 1919 as a standard [[United States Railroad Administration|USRA]] light Mikado for the [[Pennsylvania Railroad]]. The PRR, for unknown reasons, rejected 33 of 38 locomotives in the order.  The USRA reassigned 23 of them (road numbers 4000-4007 and 4017-4031) to the [[St. Louis-San Francisco Railroad]], better known as the "Frisco".  The Frisco also received 10 sisters from the [[Indiana Harbor Belt Railroad]] (road numbers 4008-4016 and 4032), making 33 in all.

==The USRA Designs==
The railroads of the United States were nationalized during [[World War I]], from December, 1917 to March, 1920.  As part of this, locomotives built during the period were one of the twelve [[USRA standard|USRA standard designs]], which included the [[USRA Light Mikado|Light Mikado]].  4003 was one of 625 built by the USRA; another 641 were built after the USRA era, making it one of the most numerous single locomotive designs of all time. After Frisco received the Mikados, it modified them with [[booster engine|boosters]] on the trailing trucks and raised cab roofs for more headroom.<ref name=ahpp/>

==4003==
4003 was one of three of the class built by Alco at its [[Schenectady Locomotive Works]] in late summer 1919.  The balance of the class was built by [[Lima Locomotive Works|Lima]].<ref name=slc/> It cost $53,619.<ref name=ahpp/>

The Frisco put it into service hauling freight between [[Fort Smith, Arkansas]] and [[Monett, Missouri]], which included a stretch through the [[Boston Mountains]] that was relatively steep. Two major sources of carloads were berries, a million quarts shipped in 1941, and zinc, which was smelted in Fort Smith.<ref name=ahpp/>

Like all the other US railroads, the Frisco actively began converting to diesel power in the late forties.  4003 was retired in early 1952, shortly before the last steam powered train on the Frisco, between [[Birmingham, Alabama|Birmingham]] and [[Bessemer, Alabama]] in February. Frisco kept the locomotive until 1954 when it donated it to the City of Fort Smith. The city placed it on display in 
[[Fort Smith, Arkansas#Event venues|Kay Rodgers Park]] where it remained for almost 50 years.  Early in this century, the city transferred the locomotive to the [[Fort Smith Trolley Museum]] with the provision that the museum pay for the moving.  It now sits outside at the museum. While it could probably be restored to operating condition, the museum has no track on which to run it and the restoration cost would be considerable.<ref name=ahpp/>

The locomotive was added to the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 2004 as '''St. Louis San Francisco (Frisco) Railway Steam Locomotive #4003'''.<ref name=nris/>
