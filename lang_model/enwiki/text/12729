'''Sandra Morgan''' (born [[June 6]] [[1942]]), known after marriage as '''Sandra Beavis''', was an [[Australia|Australian]] [[Freestyle swimming|freestyle]] swimmer of the 1950s, who won a gold medal in the 4&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;100&nbsp;m freestyle relay at the [[1956 Summer Olympics|1956 Melbourne Olympics]]. This feat, at the age of 14 years and 6 months, made her the youngest Australian to have won an Olympic gold medal, a record that still stands. Morgan began serious training in early 1956 and won Olympic selection for the relay team as well as the individual 400&nbsp;m freestyle. Morgan's selection in the final quartet raised controversy given her inexperience in top-level racing and her history of [[false start]]s. During the final, she lifted her head out of the water and saw her American opponent ahead of her, prompting her to put in a late burst and regain the lead for Australia in the third leg. Australia went on to win the relay in world record time. Morgan came sixth in the 400&nbsp;m freestyle. In 1957, she won the 110-220-440&nbsp;yd treble at the Australian championships after her main competition did not compete but from thereon her career was plagued by illness and weight problems. She was selected in the [[1958 British Empire and Commonwealth Games]] as a relay swimmer only, winning gold in the event. At her second [[1960 Summer Olympics|Olympics in 1960]] in [[Rome]], she raced only in the relay heats; her team-mates went onto win the silver medal. She retired from competitive swimming following the Rome Olympics.

== Early years ==
Morgan was born in the north-western [[New South Wales]] city of [[Tamworth, New South Wales|Tamworth]] and grew up in [[Punchbowl, New South Wales|Punchbowl]], a western suburb of [[Sydney]].<ref name="h135">Howell, p. 135.</ref> Morgan was the oldest of four children, with two younger sisters and one younger brother. Her father Barrington, a plumber by trade, had success as a swimmer in his childhood but lack of facilities in rural Australia curtailed his career. As a result he was determined that his daughter would become a national champion. Morgan recalled that her father "became my driving and inspirational force. I not only fulfilled his ambition, but surpassed it by becoming an Olympic champion!"<Ref name="h135"/> Morgan also cited her meetings with [[Frederick Lane]], Australia's first Olympic gold medallist in swimming, and later, the Olympic athletics champion [[Marjorie Jackson-Nelson]] as motivating her in her career.<ref name="h135"/>

Morgan learnt to swim at [[Bankstown, New South Wales|Bankstown]] at the age of seven. She was initially a slow learner and the coach used a long pole attached to a rope and belt to maintain her safety. She was given twice the number of lessons as the other students.<ref name="h135"/> By the age of eight, she had won the district championship and in 1953, aged 11, she won the New South Wales (NSW) primary school championships. In February 1956, aged 13, she was taken for serious training. Her father transferred her to the tutelage of [[Frank Guthrie]] in [[Enfield, New South Wales|Enfield]].<ref name="h135"/> At the time Guthrie was regarded as the best coaches in the state, guiding [[Gary Chapman (swimmer)|Gary Chapman]] and [[Lorraine Crapp]]; both of whom would win Olympic medals with Crapp winning a gold medal later that year at the [[1956 Summer Olympics]].<Ref name="h136">Howell, p. 136.</ref> Her mother had to drive her to Enfield, as her father was busy with the plumbing business.<Ref name="h136"/>

== National selection ==
Under Guthrie's coaching, she quickly became one of the youngest junior swimmers in the state, winning the under 14 110&nbsp;yd and 50&nbsp;yd freestyle as well as the 110&nbsp;yd [[butterfly swimming|butterfly]] at the New South Wales Championships in [[1956]].<ref name="h136"/> She went on to win the junior 110&nbsp;yd freestyle at the Australian Championships, although not before her lack of experience caused two false starts. After the national championships, he competed for Marrickville Junior Girls' High School and won the State Combined High School Championship in the 110&nbsp;yd freestyle.<ref name="h136"/>

Although her times were among the fastest in the country, her young age meant that she was not selected in the Olympic training squad. However, the [[Swimming Australia|Australian Swimming Union]] allowed her to join the squad for training in [[Townsville, Queensland|Townsville]] if she could afford to pay the expenses. Her impoverished family was unable to meet these costs but a fundraising campaign from the Bankstown community allowed her to make the trip. Training alongside swimmers such as Crapp, [[Alva Colquhuon]], [[Faith Leech]] and [[Dawn Fraser]] saw Morgan's times steadily improve. The team were expected to swim three times a day, totalling more than 16 kilometres. However, she was not regarded as likely to be selected in the final team.<ref name ="h136"/>

Following the training camp, a series of selection trials were held in [[Brisbane]] and [[Melbourne]]. In three 110&nbsp;yd races, she came third, fifth and fourth respectively, with a best time of 1&nbsp;m 7.3&nbsp;s. She also managed a best performance of third in a time of 5&nbsp;m 10.0&nbsp;s in the 440&nbsp;yd freestyle behind Crapp and Fraser. Australia was entitled to three representatives in each individual event, thus allowing Morgan to compete in her first Olympics aged 14 .<ref name="h136"/> Morgan missed out in the 100&nbsp;m freestyle as Fraser, Crapp and Leech were selected,<ref name="h134">Howell, p. 134.</ref> but she gained an individual berth in the 400&nbsp;m behind Fraser and Crapp.<Ref name="h136"/> She was also named as one of six swimmers in the 4&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;100&nbsp;m freestyle relay squad, the first time Australia had entered a team in this event at the Olympics.<Ref name="h131"/> Morgan was the subject of media comment which regarded her as the weak link in the relay team, placing her under substantial pressure.<Ref name="h136"/>

Arriving in Melbourne for the Olympics, Morgan was still not assured of a place in the final quartet for the relay. In the heats, Fraser and Crapp were rested and the remaining four swimmers qualified the team. Morgan swam the second leg in 1&nbsp;m 5.4&nbsp;s, the fastest of the quartet,<Ref name="h136"/> securing her position, along with Leech, in the final team.<Ref name="h131"/> The selection of Leech and Morgan generated controversy, as they were the youngest swimmers in the squad and lacked experience at open level swimming, having both debuted at senior Australian level in [[1956]]; Morgan had false started twice at the Australian Championships while Leech had been too ill to compete earlier in the year.<ref name="h131"/> Australia was the favourite for the race, having qualified fastest and having swept the medals in the individual 100&nbsp;m event; Fraser, Crapp and Leech finishing first, second and third.<Ref name="h131">Howell, p. 131.</ref>

The Australian team made a poor start in the final when Fraser almost stopped during the first leg, believing a false start had occurred after hearing a second gun shot. She finished her leg in 64.0&nbsp;s, almost two seconds slower than her personal best, but still with a 2.3&nbsp;s over the [[United States]]' [[Sylvia Ruuska]]. Leech, swimming the second leg, maintained the lead in the first 50&nbsp;m but faded in the second half and finished in 65.1&nbsp;s; the Australian lead cut to 0.8&nbsp;s.<ref name="h132"/> Morgan dived in for the third leg but was then overhauled and passed by [[Nancy Simons]], swimming for the Americans. With 25&nbsp;m left, Morgan took her head out of the water, a cardinal sin, and seeing the American a bodylength in front, responded with a surge to regain a 0.7&nbsp;s lead into the final changeover. Crapp then established a 2.2 s victory to secure an Australian gold medal, setting a world record time of 4m 17.1s.<ref name="h132">Howell, p. 132.</ref><Ref name="aa">Andrews, pp. 307&ndash;308.</ref> The victory was the first time that Australia had made a clean sweep of the sprint relay and individual events for both men and women. It had previously only been achieved by the Americans in [[1920 Summer Olympics|1920]] in [[Antwerp]]. Australia would not win another female swimming relay event at the Olympics until the [[2004 Summer Olympics]] in [[Athens]].<ref name="h132"/> The victory saw Morgan become Australia's youngest gold medallist, a record that still stands.<ref name="h136">Howell, p. 136.</ref><Ref>Andrews, pp. 358&ndash;359.</ref>

Morgan's individual event was the 400&nbsp;m freestyle. She set a new personal best by 2.3&nbsp;s of 5&nbsp;m 7.8&nbsp;s in the heat, qualifying to the final along with Fraser and Crapp. The final was held the day after the relay final. However, Morgan was unable to repeat her heat performance in the final, finishing sixth in 5&nbsp;m 14.3&nbsp;s, far outside her personal best. Nevertheless, she noted that "I was so happy that I had made the final in an individual event in the Olympic Games, for this was my first appearance in a senior competition."<Ref name="h136"/><Ref name="aa"/> 

Morgan was honoured with a civic reception on her return to the [[City of Bankstown]] and presented with a gold watch and a life membership to the Bankstown Pool. However, her stay at the Olympic village had given rise to a new problem. She enjoyed the food so much that she had gained {{convert|9.5|kg|lb|link=on}}  in weight, and now stood at {{convert|170|cm|ftin|link=on}} and weighed {{convert|76.2|kg|lb}}. This was to herald the start of a continual problem with her weight.<Ref name="h137">Howell, p. 137.</ref>

== Later years ==
After the Olympics, Crapp and Fraser took a break from competitive swimming,<Ref name="h137"/> while Leech retired.<Ref name="h135"/> This allowed Morgan an opening, and she won both the junior and open sprint titles at the 1957 NSW State Championships. She followed this by winning five titles at the Australian titles in [[Canberra]]; the 110&nbsp;yd, 220&nbsp;yd and 440&nbsp;yd freestyle, in times of 1&nbsp;m 7.8&nbsp;s, 2&nbsp;29.3&nbsp;s and 5&nbsp;21.6&nbsp;s respectively, times that were slower than she had produced in 1956.<ref name="h137"/> She also was part of the New South Wales team  that won the 4&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;100&nbsp;yd freestyle and medley relays.<ref name="h137"/> 

In 1958, Crapp and Fraser returned, while [[Ilsa Konrads]] emerged as a leading swimmer. At the national championships Morgan came third in both the 110&nbsp;yd and 440&nbsp;yd freestyle events; Fraser winning both and Crapp and Konrads second in the 100&nbsp;yd and 400&nbsp;yd respectively. Morgan was selected for the [[1958 British Empire and Commonwealth Games]] in [[Cardiff]], [[Wales]], but only in the 4&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;110&nbsp;yd freestyle relay. Along with Fraser, Crapp and Konrads, she had broken the world record for the event in March in Australia with a time of 4&nbsp;m 18.9&nbsp;s. At the Empire Games in [[Cardiff]], Fraser, Crapp, Morgan and Colquhuon lowered Australia's world record to a time of 4&nbsp;m 17.4&nbsp;s to win the gold medal.<ref name="h137"/><ref name="aa"/>

After the Empire Games, the Australian team returned to Australia via [[France]], [[Austria]], [[Germany]], [[Netherlands]], [[Italy]] and [[Singapore]] for a series of racing events. Morgan's best performances were at the Dutch and French championships, where she came third in the 400&nbsp;m events. In 1959, she placed third in both the 440&nbsp;yd and 880&nbsp;yd freestyle events at the Australian championships. Her swimming career was then interrupted due to [[Bronchitis]], later developing into [[bronchial pneumonia]]. The illness forced her to take an extended period of rest. Her chest problems remained while competing at the 1960 Australian Championships where she came third in the 220&nbsp;yd and 440&nbsp;yd freestyle and fifth in the 110&nbsp;yd freestyle. She was selected for the [[1960 Summer Olympics]] in [[Rome]] in the 4&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;100&nbsp;m freestyle. She swam the heat but was not used in the final, where Australia won the silver medal.<ref name="h137"/> Under the rules of the time, heat swimmers were not awarded medals won in the final.<ref>Andrews, p. 323.</ref><ref name="aa"/> Suffering from periodic chest pain, she retired from competitive swimming in December 1960.<ref name="h137"/>

Morgan later married and had three daughters, all of whom enjoyed victories in swimming at school and district level. She experimented with coaching, but found the competition unappealing and later became a schoolteacher. In 1978, she began teaching handicapped children to swim in her backyard pool.<ref name="h137"/>
