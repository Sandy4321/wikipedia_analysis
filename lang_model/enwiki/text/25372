I am the Whistler, and I know many things, for I walk by night. I know many strange tales,  hidden in the hearts of men and women who have stepped into the shadows. Yes ... I know the nameless terrors of which they dare not speak.

'''''The Whistler''''' was one of [[United States|American]] radio's most popular mystery dramas, with a 13-year run from [[May 16]], [[1942]] until [[September 22]], [[1955]].''The Whistler'' was the most popular [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]]-originated program with its listeners for many years. It was sponsored by the Signal Oil Company: "That whistle is your signal for the Signal Oil program, ''The Whistler''." 

==Radio program==

Each episode of ''The Whistler'' began with the sound of footsteps and a person whistling.<ref name="Dunning720" />

The stories followed an effective formula in which a person's criminal acts were typically undone by either an overlooked but important detail or their own stupidity, except on some rare occasions when a curious twist of fate caused the story to end happily for the episode's protagonist. Ironic twist endings were a key feature of each episode of the series. The Whistler himself narrated, often commenting directly upon the action in the manner of a [[Greek chorus]], taunting the criminal from an omniscient perspective.

Bill Forman had the title role of host and narrator. Others who portrayed the Whistler at various times were [[Gale Gordon]], [[Joseph Kearns]], [[Marvin Miller (actor)|Marvin Miller]] (announcer for ''The Whistler'' and ''[[The Bickersons]]'' and, later, Michael Anthony on TV's ''[[The Millionaire]]''), Bill Johnstone (who had the title role on radio's ''[[The Shadow]]'' from 1938 to 1943) and Everett Clarke. Cast members included [[Hans Conried]],<ref name="Dunning720" /> [[Joseph Kearns]],<ref name="Dunning720" /> [[Cathy Lewis]],<ref>Dunning (1998), 513.</ref> [[Elliott Lewis]],<ref name="Dunning720">Dunning (1998), 720.</ref> [[Gerald Mohr]],<ref name="Dunning720" /> [[Lurene Tuttle]],<ref name="Dunning720" /> and [[Jack Webb]].<ref>Dunning (1998), 209.</ref>

Writer-producer J. Donald Wilson established the tone of the show during its first two years, and he was followed in 1944 by producer-director George Allen. Other directors included Sterling Tracy and Sherman Marks with final scripts by Joel Malone and Harold Swanton. A total of 692 episodes were produced, of which over 200 no longer have copies in existence. In 1946, a local [[Chicago]] version of ''The Whistler'' with local actors aired Sundays on [[WBBM (AM)|WBBM]], sponsored by [[Miller Lite|Meister Brau]] beer.
