'''Houston''' is the largest city in the state of [[Texas]], the fourth-largest in the [[United States|United&nbsp;States]]. As of the 2005 U.S. Census estimate, it had a population of more than 2 million. The city covers more than 600 square miles (1,600&nbsp;km<U+00B2>). Houston is the county seat of [[Harris County, Texas|Harris&nbsp;County]] and part of the [[Greater Houston|Houston<U+2013>Sugar&nbsp;Land<U+2013>Baytown]] metropolitan area, the sixth-largest [[United States metropolitan area|metropolitan area]] <ref>[http://www.houston.org/media/documents/09AW025_001.pdf Current Population Estimates]. ''Houston Population Estimates, July 2006'' 2006. Retrieved on [[2007-04-04]].</ref> in the U.S. with a population of more than 5.5 million.

Houston was founded on [[August 30]], [[1836]] by brothers Augustus Chapman Allen and John Kirby Allen on land near the banks of [[Buffalo Bayou]]. The city was incorporated on [[June 5]], [[1837]] and named after General [[Sam Houston]], commander at the [[Battle of San Jacinto]]. The burgeoning port and railroad industry, combined with oil discovery in [[1901]], has induced continual surges in Houston's population. In the 20th century, Houston became the home of the Texas Medical Center, the world's largest concentration of healthcare and research institutions, and NASA's Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center.

Houston's economy has a broad industrial base in the energy, aeronautics, and technology industries and only New York City is home to more Fortune 500 headquarters. The [[Port of Houston]] ranks first in the United States in international waterborne tonnage handled and second in total cargo tonnage handled.<ref name="port ranking">[http://www.aapa-ports.org/files/Statistics/2004%5FUS%5FPORT%5FCARGO%5FTONNAGE%5FRANKINGS.xls U.S. Port Ranking by Cargo Volume 2004]. Port Industry Information, ''American Association of Port Authorities.'' 2004. Retrieved on [[2007-01-15]].</ref> Houston is also home to [[Rice University]], one of the United States's leading teaching and research universities, and the [[University of Houston]], Texas's third-largest public research university with more than 36,000 students from 130 countries.

Houston is a multicultural city with a large and growing international community. The [[Houston Museum District|Museum District]] is home to many cultural institutions and exhibits, attracting more than 7 million visitors a year. Houston has an active visual and performing arts scene as one of five U.S. cities that offer year-round resident companies in all major performing arts.

According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of 601.7 square miles (1,558.4&nbsp;km<U+00B2>); this comprises 579.4 square miles (1,500.7&nbsp;km<U+00B2>) of land and 22.3 square miles (57.7&nbsp;km<U+00B2>) of water.

Most of Houston is located on the [[Western Gulf coastal grasslands|gulf coastal plain]], and its vegetation is classified as temperate grassland and forest. Much of the city was built on forested land, marshes, swamp, or [[prairie]], which are all still visible in surrounding areas.

===Geology===
Underpinning Houston's land surface are [[Consolidation (geology)|unconsolidated]] clays, clay [[shale]]s, and poorly-cemented [[sand]]s up to several miles deep. The region's [[geology]] developed from river deposits formed from the erosion of the [[Rocky Mountains]]. These [[sediment]]s consist of a series of sands and clays deposited on decaying organic matter that, over time, transformed into oil and natural gas. Beneath the layers of sediment is a water-deposited layer of [[halite]], a rock salt. The porous layers were compressed over time and forced upward. As it pushed upward, the salt dragged surrounding sediments into [[salt dome]] formations, often trapping oil and gas that seeped from the surrounding porous sands. The thick, rich, sometimes black, surface soil is suitable for rice farming in suburban outskirts where the city continues to grow.<ref>[http://www.tsha.utexas.edu/handbook/online/articles/HH/hch7.html Harris County].

Houston was incorporated in 1837 under the [[Ward (politics)|ward]] system of representation. The ward designation is the progenitor of the nine current-day Houston City Council districts. Locations in Houston are generally classified as either being inside or outside the [[Interstate 610 (Texas)|Interstate&nbsp;610 Loop]]. The inside encompasses the [[central business district]] and many residential neighborhoods that predate World War II. More recently, high-density residential areas have been developed within the loop. The city's outlying areas, suburbs and enclaves are located outside of the loop.

In the 1960s, [[Downtown Houston]] comprised of a modest collection of mid-rise office structures, but has since grown into one of the largest [[skyline]]s in the United States. Downtown was on the threshold of a boom in 1970 with huge projects being launched by [[real estate developer]]s with the energy industry boom. A succession of skyscrapers were built throughout the 1970s<U+2014>many by real estate developer [[Gerald D.

Centered around Post Oak Boulevard and [[Houston Galleria|the Galleria]], the [[Uptown Houston|Uptown]] district boomed during the 1970s and early 1980s when a collection of mid-rise office buildings, hotels, and retail developments appeared along [[Interstate 610 (Texas)|Interstate 610]] west. Uptown became one of the most impressive instances of an [[edge city]]. The highest achievement of Uptown was the construction of the 64-floor, 901-foot-tall (275&nbsp;m), [[Philip Johnson]] and [[John Burgee]] designed landmark [[Williams Tower]] (known as the Transco Tower until 1999). At the time, it was believed to the be the world's tallest skyscraper outside of a central business district. The Uptown District is also home to other buildings designed by noted architects such as [[I. M. Pei]], [[C<U+00E9>sar Pelli]], and [[Philip Johnson]].

The [[Metropolitan Transit Authority of Harris County, Texas]], or METRO, provides public transportation in the form of buses, light rail, and lift vans. METRO's various forms of public transportation still do not connect many of the suburbs to the greater city, causing Houstonians to rely on the automobile as a primary source of transportation.

METRO began light rail service ([[METRORail]]) on [[January 1]], [[2004]]. The inaugural track runs about 8&nbsp;miles (13&nbsp;km) from northern Downtown at [[University of Houston<U+2013>Downtown|UH<U+2013>Downtown]] to the [[Texas Medical Center]] and [[Reliant Park]].

The second-largest commercial airport in Houston is [[William P. Hobby Airport]] (named Houston International Airport until 1967). The airport operates primarily small to medium-haul flights and is the only airport in Houston served by [[Southwest Airlines]] and [[JetBlue Airways]]. Houston's aviation history is showcased in the [[1940 Air Terminal Museum]] located in the old terminal building on the west side of Hobby Airport. 

The third-largest airport is [[Ellington Field]], a former [[United States Air Force|U.S. Air Force]] base, used by military, commercial, government and general aviation sectors.
