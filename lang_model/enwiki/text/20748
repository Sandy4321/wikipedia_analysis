<!-- Created with subst: of [[Template:Hurricane season single]]. -->The '''1985 Atlantic hurricane season''' had 6&nbsp;[[United States|U.S.]] [[Landfall (meteorology)|landfalling]] hurricanes, which was the highest number in [[1886 Atlantic hurricane season|99&nbsp;years]].<ref name="ACE"/> The season officially began on June&nbsp;1 and lasted until November&nbsp;30.<ref name="seasondates">{{cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=s2BEAAAAIBAJ&sjid=KrIMAAAAIBAJ&pg=1234,34305&dq=hurricane+season&hl=en|title=Hurricane Season Smells of Disaster|author=William E. Schultz|date=June 1, 1985|agency=[[Associated Press]]|newspaper=[[The Albany Herald]]|page=5|accessdate=July 28, 2013|location=Atlanta, Georgia}}</ref> It was an average season, with 11&nbsp;[[Tropical cyclone naming|named storm]]s developing. This was partially attributed to a [[La Ni<U+00F1>a]] &ndash; a meteorological phenomenon that produces favorable conditions across the Atlantic basin, such as lower [[wind shear]] and higher [[sea surface temperature]]s. The first storm, Ana, developed on July&nbsp;15 near [[Bermuda]] and caused minor effects in Canada while transitioning into an [[extratropical cyclone]]. Four other tropical cyclones &ndash; Claudette, Henri, and Isabel &ndash; did not significantly affect land. Claudette developed offshore of the [[Southeastern United States]] and brushed Bermuda and the [[Azores]]. Henri and Isabel were dissipating as they approached land. However, the precursor of the latter caused a severe flood in [[Puerto Rico]] that killed 180&nbsp;people. Additionally, Tropical Storm Fabian and three tropical depressions did not have any known impact on land.

Although several storms caused minimal effects, several tropical cyclones also left extensive impact. [[Hurricane Gloria]], the strongest storm of the season, resulted in 8&nbsp;fatalities and about $900&nbsp;million (1985&nbsp;[[United States dollar|USD]]) in damage in [[North Carolina]], [[Virginia]], the [[Mid-Atlantic states|Mid-Atlantic]], and [[New England]]. [[Hurricane Elena]] threatened the central [[Gulf Coast of the United States]], then abruptly re-curved toward [[Florida]]. Unexpectedly, Elena doubled-back and struck [[Mississippi]], resulting in two mass evacuations. The storm caused $1.25&nbsp;billion in losses, with most of the damage in [[Louisiana]] and Mississippi. Similarly, [[Hurricane Juan (1985)|Hurricane Juan]] caused more than $1&nbsp;billion in damage due to its erratic tracked offshore and across Louisiana. The remnants of Hurricane Juan brought severe flooding to [[Virginia]], [[West Virginia]], and [[Pennsylvania]], which resulted in 62&nbsp;deaths and an additional $1.3&nbsp;billion in damage. Three other tropical cyclones &ndash; Hurricanes [[Hurricane Bob (1985)|Bob]], [[Hurricane Danny (1985)|Danny]], and [[Hurricane Kate (1985)|Kate]] &ndash; caused moderate to extensive damage in [[Cuba]] and the United States. Overall, the tropical cyclones of this season collectively caused over $5.5&nbsp;billion in damage and 302&nbsp;deaths.

In the second week of July, an area of convection merged with a [[Low pressure area|cut-off low pressure area]], which developed on July&nbsp;8. After about 7&nbsp;days, ship data indicated that a circulation developed on July&nbsp;15. Thus, the system became Tropical Depression One at 1800&nbsp;UTC that same day, while located south-southeast of [[Bermuda]]. The depression slowly curved northwestward around Bermuda and began strengthening. By late on July&nbsp;16, the depression strengthened into Tropical Storm Ana. Thereafter, the storm turned northward and passed west of Bermuda later that day.<ref name="Atcr1">{{cite report|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/storm_wallets/atlantic/atl1985-prelim/ana/prelim01.gif|title=Preliminary Report: Tropical Storm Ana 15-19 July 1985|year=1985|page=1|work=National Hurricane Center|publisher=National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration|location=Miami, Florida|accessdate=December 11, 2012}}</ref> On July&nbsp;17, Ana accelerate north-northeastward under the influence of a frontal system and eventually paralleled [[Nova Scotia]].<ref name="Atcr2"/>

While passing close to [[Sable Island]] on July&nbsp;19, Ana peaked with winds of 70&nbsp;mph (110&nbsp;km/h).

{{Main|Hurricane Bob (1985)}}
A [[tropical wave]] developed into Tropical Depression Two in the eastern Gulf of Mexico on July&nbsp;21. The drifted southeastward and then northeastward without significant intensification. However, late on July&nbsp;22, it was upgraded to Tropical Storm Bob. The cyclone made landfall near [[Fort Myers, Florida]] with winds of 45&nbsp;mph (70&nbsp;km/h) on the following day. While crossing Florida, Bob curved sharply northward and emerged into the Atlantic Ocean near [[Vero Beach, Florida|Vero Beach]] early on July&nbsp;24.

A trough and an associated low-level circulation were observed over the Gulf Coast of the United States on August&nbsp;7. The system moved eastward and entered the Atlantic Ocean, where it transitioned into a low pressure area offshore Georgia on August&nbsp;9. Around that time, the system developed into a subtropical depression. It strengthened and slowly acquired tropical characteristics while moving east-northeastward. Early on August&nbsp;11, the depression was reclassified as Tropical Storm Claudette. As the storm passed north of Bermuda late on August&nbsp;12, minor effects were reported, with sustained winds reaching 28&nbsp;mph (45&nbsp;km/h) and rainfall up to {{convert|0.61|in|mm|abbr=on}}. Continuing eastward, Claudette attained hurricane status early on August&nbsp;14.<ref name="Ctcr1"/>

The remnants of Tropical Depression Six drifted northeastward and crossed [[Hispaniola]] on September&nbsp;15. Later that day, the remnants of the depression emerged into the Atlantic Ocean. It combined with the remnants of a frontal system and quickly developed into a surface low. At 1800&nbsp;UTC on September&nbsp;15, Tropical Depression Seven formed about {{convert|150|mi|km|abbr=on}} north-northeast of [[Cockburn Town]], [[Turks and Caicos Islands]]. The depression was steered northeastward by a frontal trough, which was extending northeastward into the Atlantic. It is estimated that the depression strengthened into Tropical Storm Fabian at 1800&nbsp;UTC on September&nbsp;16, which was when a reconnaissance aircraft reported an atmospheric pressure of {{convert|1004|mbar|inHg|abbr=on}}.<ref name="fprelim1"/>

Juan re-curved several times, but eventually moved north-northwest on October&nbsp;27. The storm strengthened and by early on October&nbsp;28, it became a hurricane. Later that day, sustained winds peaked at 85&nbsp;mph (140&nbsp;km/h). Between October&nbsp;28 and October&nbsp;29, the storm executed a cyclonic loop just offshore Louisiana. Shortly before 1200&nbsp;UTC on that day, Juan made landfall near [[Morgan City, Louisiana]] as a minimal hurricane. It quickly weakened back to a tropical storm. The storm began to execute another cyclonic loop, reaching the [[Lafayette, Louisiana|Lafayette area]] before curving back out to the Gulf of Mexico on October&nbsp;30. The storm briefly remained offshore, before a second landfall on the [[Mississippi River Delta]] in Louisiana early on October&nbsp;31. Juan re-emerged into the Gulf of Mexico, before yet another landfall near [[Gulf Shores, Alabama]].{{Atlantic hurricane best track}} The storm weakened inland and became extratropical over [[Tennessee]] on November&nbsp;1.<ref name="jtcr1"/>

Juan produced large waves at oil rigs in the Gulf of Mexico, causing several damaged platforms, vessels, and killed nine people. The erratic motion of the storm offshore and inland over Louisiana resulted in heavy rainfall, peaking at {{convert|17.78|in|mm}} in [[Galliano, Louisiana|Galliano]].{{Tropical Cyclone Point Maxima}} Significant flood ensued, damaging 5,000&nbsp;homes and 100&nbsp;businesses. In [[Jefferson Parish, Louisiana|Jefferson Parish]] alone, heavy rainfall and storm surge combined flooded at least 2,233&nbsp;homes, 3,100&nbsp;cars, and 100&nbsp;businesses. In southern [[Mississippi]], rainfall exceeding {{convert|10|in|mm}} in some areas inundated 342-352&nbsp;homes and 6&nbsp;businesses. The remnants of Juan also produced extensive flooding in the [[Appalachia]] region of the United States. Flood levels along rivers such as the [[James River|James]], [[Potomac River|Potomac]], and [[Roanoke River]]s in [[Virginia]] rivaled that of [[Hurricane Camille]] in [[1969 Atlantic hurricane season|1969]] and [[Hurricane Agnes]] in [[1972 Atlantic hurricane season|1972]]. In the state of Virginia alone, damaged exceeded $800&nbsp;million. [[West Virginia]] was also significantly impacted. Many streams and rivers rose to 100-500&nbsp;year flood levels, with some cresting at record heights. As a result, whole towns, roads, and bridges were swept away.

[[File:TD13 07 dec 1985 1159Z.JPG|thumb|right|Tropical Depression Thirteen on December&nbsp;7, 1985]]
In addition to the 11&nbsp;named storms, three other tropical cyclones developed during the course of the 1985&nbsp;Atlantic hurricane season. At 1200&nbsp;UTC on September&nbsp;8, a tropical depression developed about {{convert|230|mi|km|abbr=on}} north-northwest of [[S<U+00E3>o Vicente, Cape Verde]]. It tracked west-northwestward and intensified slightly, reaching winds of 35&nbsp;mph (55&nbsp;km/h). However, no further strengthening occurred, and 1200&nbsp;UTC on September&nbsp;13, it dissipated while located about {{convert|345|mi|km|abbr=on}} east-southeast of Bermuda.{{Atlantic hurricane best track}}

Three days after the previous tropical cyclone developed, Tropical Depression Six formed about 10 miles (15 km) north of [[Tobago]] on September&nbsp;11. Shortly after developing, it made landfall near [[Tivoli, Grenada]] with winds of 30&nbsp;mph (45&nbsp;km/h). The depression remained weak, intensifying minimally and maintaining an ill-defined circulation as it tracked west-northwestward across the Caribbean Sea. Eventually, the depression began disorganizing, with convection stretching across Hispaniola, Puerto Rico, and the Leeward Islands on September&nbsp;14, despite the center being located south of [[Jamaica]]. Later that day, a reconnaissance aircraft did not indicate a circulation; thus, the depression dissipated while located about 195&nbsp;mi (315&nbsp;km) south of Kingston, Jamaica on September 14.{{Atlantic hurricane best track}} After dissipating, the depression later redeveloped into Tropical Storm Fabian.<ref name="fprelim1">{{cite report|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/storm_wallets/atlantic/atl1985-prelim/fabian/prelim01.gif|title=Preliminary Report &ndash; Tropical Storm Fabian 15-19 September 1985|year=1985|work=National Hurricane Center|publisher=National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration|location=Miami, Florida|page=1|accessdate=July 29, 2013}}</ref>

The final tropical depression developed in the southwestern Caribbean Sea on December&nbsp;7, which was seven days after the official end of the season. It was the first off-season tropical cyclone to develop in the Caribbean Sea since [[Tropical Storm Arlene (1981)|Tropical Storm Arlene]] in 1981. Designated as Tropical Depression Thirteen, it headed west-southwestward toward [[Panama]] with little change in strength. At 1800&nbsp;UTC on December&nbsp;9, the depression dissipated about {{convert|50|mi|km|abbr=on}} northwest of [[Col<U+00F3>n, Panama]].{{Atlantic hurricane best track}}
