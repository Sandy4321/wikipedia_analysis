'''''Ip Man''''' is a 2008 Hong Kong [[biographical film|semi biographical]] [[martial arts film]] very loosely based on the life of [[Yip Man]], a [[Grandmaster (martial arts)|grandmaster]] of the martial art [[Wing Chun]] and master of [[Bruce Lee]]. The film focuses on events in Ip's life that supposedly took place in the city of [[Foshan]] during the [[Second Sino-Japanese War|Sino-Japanese War]]. The film was directed by [[Wilson Yip]], and stars [[Donnie Yen]] as Ip Man, with [[Combat in film|martial arts choreography]] by [[Sammo Hung]]. The supporting cast includes [[Simon Yam]], [[Lynn Hung]], [[Gordon Lam|Lam Ka-tung]], [[Xing Yu]] and [[Hiroyuki Ikeuchi]].

The idea of an Ip Man biopic originated in 1998 when [[Jeffrey Lau]] and [[Corey Yuen]] discussed the idea of making a film based on Bruce Lee's martial arts master. However, the studio producing that proposed film closed, and the project was abandoned.  Producer [[Raymond Wong (film presenter)|Raymond Wong]] decided to develop his own Ip Man film with full consent from Ip's sons, and had filmmakers head to Foshan to research Ip's life. [[Ip Chun]], Ip Man's eldest son, along with martial arts master Leo Au-yeung and several other Wing Chun practitioners served as technical consultants for the film. [[Principal photography]] for ''Ip Man'' began in March 2008 and ended in August; filming took place in Shanghai, which was used to architecturally recreate Foshan.  During filming, conflicts arose between the producers of ''Ip Man'' and filmmaker [[Wong Kar-wai]] over the film's [[working title]]. Kar-wai, who had been developing his own Ip Man biopic, clashed with the producers after learning that their film would be titled ''Grandmaster Ip Man'' ({{zh|t=<U+4E00><U+4EE3><U+5B97><U+5E2B><U+8449><U+554F>}}), which was too similar to the title of the other film. The producers of ''Ip Man'' agreed to change the film title, despite Kar-wai's film being in [[development hell]]. Kar-wai's film, titled ''[[The Grandmaster (film)|The Grandmaster]]'', was released on 10 January 2013.

''Ip Man'' premiered in Beijing on 10 December 2008, and was released theatrically in Hong Kong on 19 December 2008, receiving widespread acclaim from critics and audiences. Before the film's release, Raymond Wong announced that there would be a sequel; a second installment titled ''[[Ip Man 2]]'', was released in April 2010. ''Ip Man'' grossed over US$21 million worldwide, despite not being released in North America and most of Europe. Following its success, the film was nominated for 12 [[28th Hong Kong Film Awards|Hong Kong Film Awards]], winning awards for [[Hong Kong Film Award for Best Film|Best Film]] and [[Hong Kong Film Award for Best Action Choreography|Best Action Choreography]].

==Plot==
''Ip Man'' is set in the 1930s in [[Foshan]], a hub of [[Nanquan|Southern Chinese martial arts]], where various schools actively recruit disciples and compete against each other. Although the [[Wing Chun]] master Ip Man is the most skilled martial artist in Foshan, he is unassuming and keeps a low profile. As an independently wealthy man, he feels no need to accept any disciples and instead spends his days training, meeting with friends, and spending time with his family. However, his wife is often resentful of the time he spends training and discussing martial arts with friends and colleagues. Though not a professional martial artist, Ip is respected in Foshan due to the abilities he displays in friendly, closed-door competitions with local masters. Ip's reputation is further enhanced when he defeats an aggressive, rude, highly skilled [[Northern_Chinese_martial_arts#Northern_styles|Northern Chinese martial arts]] master, Jin Shanzhao, thus upholding the regional pride of fellow Southern stylists and others in Foshan.

The [[Second Sino-Japanese War|Japanese invasion]] in 1937 adversely affects the life of everyone in Foshan. Ip's house is claimed by the Japanese and used as their Foshan headquarters. Ip and his family lose their wealth and are forced to move into a decrepit house. Desperate to support his family, Ip accepts work as a [[coolie]] at a coal mine. The Japanese General Miura, who is a [[Karate]] master, establishes an arena where Chinese martial artists compete with his military trainees. The Chinese earn a bag of rice for every match they win. Li Zhao, a former police officer and Ip's acquaintance, is now working as a translator for the Japanese and is making the offer to the martial artists working as coolies. Ip at first declines to participate in the matches. However, when his friend Lin goes missing, he agrees to take part in order to investigate. He is enraged when he sees a fellow Foshan master (Master Liu) mercilessly executed for picking up a bag of rice from a prior victory after giving up in a second match against three karateka.  He also comes to understand that Lin was killed in an earlier fight.  Barely able to contain his rage, Ip demands a match with ten karateka at once.  Despite having not practiced Wing Chun since the invasion began (in order to conserve what little food his family had to survive), he proceeds to mercilessly crush each of them with a brutal barrage of his martial art mastery, showing none of the restraint he exhibited in previous engagements. His skill arouses the interest of Miura, who seeks to learn more about Ip and see him fight again.

Ip visits his friend Chow Ching-chuen, who owns and runs a cotton mill in Foshan. Chow tells Ip that a highway robbery gang led by Jin Shanzhao is harassing his workers and trying to extort money from them. Ip trains the workers in Wing Chun for self-defense. Meanwhile, Miura grows impatient when Ip does not return to the arena and sends men to find him, prompting Ip to incapacitate them and go into hiding with his family at Li Zhao's house. Meanwhile, the robbers return to the cotton mill to demand money. The workers fight back using the techniques that Ip taught them, but Ip appears to take care of things personally and defeats Jin Shanzhao, warning him never to harass the workers again.

The Japanese soldiers eventually find Ip at the cotton mill. Miura tells Ip that his life will be spared if he agrees to instruct the Japanese soldiers in martial arts. Ip refuses and challenges Miura to a match, which Miura accepts, both because of his love for martial arts and because refusing the challenge would be a humiliation to the Japanese. The match between Ip and Miura is held in public in Foshan's square. At first, the two fighters seem equally matched, but Miura soon finds himself unable to penetrate Ip's impeccable defense and becomes overwhelmed by his relentless and direct blows. He is helpless to defend himself as Ip effortlessly uses him as a Wooden Dummy, inflicting a severe beating on him and clearly winning.

As the beaten general lies down after his defeat, Ip looks over to the cheering Chinese crowd and spots his wife and child with Chow. Suddenly, Miura's deputy Sato shoots Ip, sparking a scuffle between the Chinese audience and the Japanese soldiers. During the scuffle, Li Zhao kills Sato with Sato's [[Nambu pistol|own gun]]. Ip is taken away amidst the chaos. It is revealed that he survives and escapes to [[Hong Kong]] with his family. There, Ip establishes a Wing Chun school, where his students come to learn martial arts from him, including [[Bruce Lee]].

===Pre-production===
The film was originally conceived in 1998 when [[Jeffrey Lau]] and [[Corey Yuen]] first thought of the idea of making a film based on Ip Man's life. Donnie Yen signed onto the project, hoping to star as Ip, with [[Stephen Chow]] co-starring as Bruce Lee. Yen had signed the contract and received part of the acting fee. However, the studio producing the film closed, and the project was abandoned.<ref name="Yip Man vs. Ip Man">{{Cite web|url=http://kaleidoscope.cultural-china.com/en/186K6506K12199.html|title=Kaleidoscope -> Chinese Kungfu|work=kaleidoscope.cultural-china.com|accessdate=26 August 2011|quote=10 years back, Jeff Lau teamed up with Corey Yuen to bring the story of Yip Man on the screen, with Donnie Yen as Yip Man and Stephen Chow as Bruce Lee.

In December 2007, plans to make a new Ip Man film were announced with the filmmakers researching Ip's life in [[Foshan]]. Producer Raymond Wong stated that the film would take on a similar look and feel to ''[[SPL: Sha Po Lang]]''.<ref name="Legend of Yip Man Cast Announced">{{Cite web|url=http://www.wu-jing.org/happenings/archives/22-Legend-of-Yip-Man-Cast-Announced.html|title=Legend of Yip Man Cast Announced - Wu-Jing.org|work=Wu-Jing.org|accessdate=7 January 2010|quote= <U+300A><U+53F6><U+95EE><U+4F20><U+300B> Legend of Yip Man, produced by Mandarin Films, will begin production in late February 2008.

===Filming===
Principal photography for ''Ip Man'' began in March 2008, and was completed by the end of August. A majority of the film focuses on events surrounding Ip Man that took place in Foshan in the 1930s and 1940s during the [[Second Sino-Japanese War|Sino-Japanese War]]. Since the buildings in modern-day Foshan are architecturally different from the ones of the film's period, the filmmakers decided to shoot the film in Shanghai.<ref name="Yip Man is No More a Legend"/><ref name="It's a Wrap for Ip Man">{{Cite web|url=http://www.wu-jing.org/happenings/archives/548-Its-A-Wrap-For-Ip-Man.html#extended|title= It's a Wrap For Ip Man - Wu-Jing.org|accessdate=7 January 2010}}</ref>

Filming first took place in a storeroom in the industrial district of Shanghai. Having difficulties scouting a cotton factory suitable for shooting, set designers decided to recreate one in the style of the 1930s. They spent weeks transforming an abandoned storeroom into the Zhen Hua Cotton Mill Factory, a 1930s cotton mill factory founded by Ip's friend Chow Ching-chuen (played in the film by [[Simon Yam]]) during the Sino-Japanese War. It was where Ip Man first taught Wing Chun openly to the public.<ref name="Ip Man Blog">{{cite web|title=ipman <U+00BB> <U+62CD><U+651D><U+904E><U+7A0B> About the Shooting|url=http://www.ipman-movie.com/blog/?cat=5|publisher=ipman-movie.com|accessdate=18 July 2013|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20090412061505/http://www.ipman-movie.com/blog/?cat=5|archivedate=12 April 2009}}</ref>

Production designer Kenneth Mak included Western elements in his design, since Foshan, in earlier years, was a unique place where Chinese and Western cultures converged. Pillars were made to resemble English lampposts, and Western lighting, chairs and tableware were also used. To convey the culture and feel of the time, the buildings were made to look obsolete and worn out. Apart from historical references, Mak also created a glass house which was used in scene in the film.<ref name="Ip Man Blog"/>

===Stunts and choreography===
{{quote box|width=40%|quote="...his biggest achievement lies in playing a true historical figure, unlike fictitious characters he had been doing in the past...he'd have to try his best to understand the thoughts of Yip Man, to be him, and to fit in within the past."|source=<U+2014>Director Wilson Yip on Donnie Yen being cast as Ip Man.<ref name="Yip Man is No More a Legend"/>}}

The [[combat in film|martial arts choreography]] was designed by [[Sammo Hung]] and veteran fight and stunt coordinator Tony Leung Siu-hung. Hung had previously collaborated with Wilson Yip and Donnie Yen as an actor in the 2005 film ''[[SPL: Sha Po Lang]]''.<ref name="Martial Arts Director Sammo Hung Has a Cameo in Ip Man">{{Cite web|url=http://www.wu-jing.org/happenings/archives/531-Martial-Arts-Director-Sammo-Hung-Has-A-Cameo-In-Ip-Man.html|title= Martial Arts Director Sammo Hung Has a Cameo in Ip Man|accessdate=7 January 2010}}</ref> He was hired as the choreographer mainly because of his experience on the 1978 film ''[[Warriors Two]]'' and 1982's ''[[The Prodigal Son (film)|The Prodigal Son]]'', both of which involved Wing Chun.<ref name="star-ecentral" /> When asked how he would work with Yen to direct the action scenes, Hung replied matter-of-factly, "With my mouth."<ref name="Yip Man is No More a Legend"/>

Yen described the role as the most emotionally and mentally difficult in his career.<ref name="star-ecentral" /> He spent months preparing for the role by going on a strict diet which consisted of eating one meal a day, training in [[Wing Chun]], and learning more about Ip Man through his two sons. This was all in the hopes of portraying an erudite and cultured Ip Man, as well as bringing out the special traits of Wing Chun.<ref name="Grandmaster Yip Man Plot Revealed">{{Cite web|url= http://www.wu-jing.org/happenings/archives/500-Grandmaster-Yip-Man-Plot-Revealed-at-Shanghai-Press-Conference.html |title= Grandmaster Yip Man Plot Revealed at Shanghai Press Conference - Wu-Jing.org|date= 14 July 2008|accessdate = 8 January 2008}}</ref> Yen even went as far as to stay in character after filming, wearing his costume and changing his voice and movement patterns.<ref name="star-ecentral" /> While rehearsing a fight scene, Yen was reportedly injured when an axe wielder accidentally slashed the side of his left eye.<ref name="Donnie Yen Got A Slash Near His Eye">{{Cite web|url=http://www.wu-jing.org/happenings/archives/449-Donnie-Yen-Got-A-Slash-Near-His-Eye-on-the-Set-of-Yip-Man.html|title= Donnie Yen Got A Slash Near His Eye on the Set of 'Yip Man' - Wu-Jing.org|date= 26 March 2008|accessdate=7 January 2010|quote=When at a promotional event on March&nbsp;25, Donnie Yen was wearing sunglasses.

==Film title controversy==
''Ip Man'''s original title was controversial. It was disputed when film director [[Wong Kar-wai]] announced plans to make his own Ip Man film with [[Tony Leung Chiu-wai]] while filming ''[[2046 (film)|2046]]''. Wong had planned his own Ip Man biopic titled ''The Great Master'' (<U+4E00><U+4EE3><U+5B97><U+5E08>), with Leung playing the role of Ip. Wong's film, however, had been in [[development hell]], having been announced several years earlier. Producer Raymond Wong wanted to name his film ''Grandmaster Yip Man'', which bore a resemblance to the title Wong Kar-wai wanted to use for his film.<ref name="Mandarin Film Plans Yip Man Film">{{Cite web|url= http://www.wu-jing.org/happenings/archives/46-Mandarin-Film-Plans-Yip-Man-Film.html|title= Mandarin Film Plans Yip Man Film - Wu-Jing.org|date= 16 October 2007|accessdate = 8 January 2008}}</ref>

To settle the dispute, Raymond Wong publicly retracted the film title, stating "Actually, all along, we have called our film ''Ip Man'', but our mainland investors said that Yip Man was a great master of his times, so we changed our title to ''Grandmaster Yip Man'' out of respect for him."<ref name="Y Ip Man Stripped Of Grandmaster Status">{{Cite web| title = Y Ip Man Stripped Of Grandmaster Status? - Wu-Jing.org| publisher=wu-jing.org| date = 12 June 2008| url = http://www.wu-jing.org/happenings/archives/520-Y-Ip-Man-Stripped-Of-Grandmaster-Status.html| accessdate = 9 May 2010 }}</ref> In a more recent interview, Raymond Wong revealed that ''The Great Master'' is currently in development.<ref name="Ip Man 2 May Still Focus on...

===Reception===
Prior to its theatrical release in China, ''Ip Man'' held a [[test screening]] in Beijing on 4 December 2008. The film was highly praised, based on survey sheets returned by the audience. Donnie Yen's portrayal of Ip Man was repeatedly hailed as the year's best performance. High praise was also given to the film's co-stars, [[Louis Fan|Fan Siu-wong]], [[Gordon Lam|Lam Ka-tung]], and [[Lynn Hung]].<ref name="Test screening">{{Cite web | title = Positive Responses at Ip Man Test Screening - Wu-Jing.org | publisher=Wu-Jing.org | date =5 December. 2008| url = http://www.wu-jing.org/happenings/archives/604-Positive-Responses-at-Ip-Man-Test-Screening.html| accessdate = 10 February 2010 |quote =Test screening for Ip Man was held in Beijing on Dec&nbsp;4. Based on the survey sheets returned by the audience, it's an unanimous recommendation. Donnie Yen's portrayal of Yip Man was billed as the year's best performance. Donnie Yen has acquitted himself well as a great master, besting his two other works this year. High marks were also given to Fan Siu-wong, Lam Ka-tung, and Lynn Hung. The first half of the film is filled with more laidback, humorous moments, amply showing Ip Man's kungfu. The second half is thoughtful, stirring and nationalistic, amply showing Ip Man's grandmaster spirit. As a traditional kungfu film, Ip Man's martial arts scenes were awarded 8 to 9 out of 10 by 85% of the audience, while full marks were given by the rest.

''Ip Man'' also received positive reactions from film critics. ''[[Salon.com|Salon]]''{{'s}} Andrew O'Hehir deemed ''Ip Man'' a "well-paced and satisfying piece of Chinese-nationalist pulp," referring to the film's heavy [[Anti-Japanese sentiment in China|anti-Japanese sentiment]].<ref name = "Salon">{{Cite web|last = O'Hehir|first = Andrew|url = http://www.salon.com/entertainment/movies/beyond_the_multiplex/feature/2009/06/25/asian_film/|title =Exit the dragon - Beyond the Multiplex - Salon.com|date = 25 June 2009|publisher=Salon Media Group|work=''[[Salon.com]]''|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20100507185727/http://www.salon.com/entertainment/movies/beyond_the_multiplex/feature/2009/06/25/asian_film |archivedate =7 May 2010}}</ref>  



Derek Elley of ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety Magazine]]'' wrote in his review, "Yen, who's taking on real star charisma in middle age, is aces as Ip, with a simple dignity that exactly mirrors the movie's own and a gracefulness in combat that's very different from his trademark whiplash style."<ref name="Variety review">{{Cite web|last = Elley|first = Derek|work=''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]''|title = Ip Man Review <U+2013> Read Variety's Analysis Of The Movie Ip Man|url =http://variety.com/2009/film/reviews/ip-man-1200473186/|date = 20 January 2009|accessdate = 22 May 2010}}</ref> Malaysian film critic Lim Chang Moh of ''[[The Malay Mail]]'' awarded the film three stars out of four, writing that the film was "nicely balanced with great martial arts action and an engaging narrative."<ref name="Lim Chang Moh">{{Cite web|last = Lim|first = Chang Moh|url = http://limchangmoh.blogspot.co.uk/2008_12_01_archive.html|title = @ The Movies With Lim Chang Moh|date = 25 December 2008|accessdate = 22 May 2010}}</ref>  Lim later placed the film at number six in his list of "Top Ten Movies of 2008."<ref name="Lim Chang Moh 2008">{{Cite web|last = Lim|first = Chang Moh|url = http://limchangmoh.blogspot.co.uk/2008_12_01_archive.html|title = @ The Movies With Lim Chang Moh|date = 31 December 2008|accessdate = 22 May 2010}}</ref>  Jen Ogilvie of ''[[Fortean Times]]'' wrote, "what carries ''Ip Man'' is its dramatic charge: it is the story's entanglement in the real horrors of Japanese occupation that pulls the viewer in and builds tension into the fight scenes.<ref name="Fortean Times">{{Cite web | last = Ogilve | first = Jen | title = Ip Man  | publisher=[[Fortean Times]]| date = September 2009| url = http://www.forteantimes.com/reviews/films/2188/ip_man.html| accessdate = 10 February 2010}}</ref>

====Historical accuracy====

Film4's review detailed the departures from history: "The real Ip Man was never, despite the film's assertions to the contrary, forced from bourgeois idleness into work by the hardships of the Second Sino-Japanese War, nor was he ever employed as a coolie in a [[colliery]] <U+2013> rather he chose of his own accord to work as a policeman (a profession lightly ridiculed within the film) before the Japanese invasion, and he continued in this line for several years after the war until Communist disapproval of his wealth and political affiliations drove him into voluntary exile in Hong Kong. While, during the war, Ip Man did indeed refuse to teach his martial arts to the military police of the occupying Japanese <U+2013> a decision which eventually forced him to flee Foshan <U+2013> he certainly never had a duel with a Japanese general."<ref name="Film4">{{Cite web  | title = Ip Man (2008) review  | publisher=Film4  | year = 2008  | url = http://www.film4.com/reviews/2008/ip-man  | accessdate = 2 September 2010 }}</ref>

Ip Man's eldest son, Ip Chun, stated that while the film was well-received, there could have been areas of improvement: "For example, the film was obviously set in Foshan, yet it was not shot on location on the actual place. Neither was the mansion like the original."<ref name="Ip Chun review">{{Cite web | title = Donnie Yen Has Had Enough of Ip Man - Wu-Jing.org | work=[[Guangzhou Daily]]| date = 8 March 2010| url = http://www.wu-jing.org/happenings/archives/795-Donnie-Yen-Has-Had-Enough-of-Ip-Man.html| accessdate = 8 April 2010 |quote =Yip Chun says, "No matter how well-received Ip Man was, there were areas that could have been better.

==Sequels==
''Ip Man'' is the first film in a planned trilogy. Donnie Yen reprised the lead role in the sequel ''[[Ip Man 2]]'', the second feature film based on the life of Ip Man. The film focuses on Ip's movements in Hong Kong as he attempts to propagate his discipline of Wing Chun martial arts; at the end it also briefly introduces a young [[Bruce Lee]] prior to becoming one of Ip's most famed disciples.  ''Ip Man 2'' was released theatrically in Hong Kong in late April 2010. [[Lynn Hung]] and [[Louis Fan|Fan Siu-wong]] reprise their supporting roles, while martial arts choreographer [[Sammo Hung]] appears as a master of [[Hung Ga]] martial arts.

Yen has expressed his lack of interest in making a third film, feeling that, "''Ip Man 2'' will incontrovertibly become a classic, bettering the first."<ref name="Hung vs. Yen">{{Cite web| title = Ip Man 2: Sammo Hung Vs Donnie Yen Round 2 - Wu-Jing.org |work=wu-jing.org | date = 30 October 2009 | url = http://www.wu-jing.org/happenings/archives/725-Ip-Man-2-Sammo-Hung-Vs-Donnie-Yen-Round-2.html | accessdate = 1 March 2010}}</ref> Yen later stated that after ''Ip Man 2'', he would no longer be involved in a film based on Ip's life.<ref name="Donnie Yen Has Had Enough of Ip Man">{{Cite web| title =Donnie Yen Has Had Enough of Ip Man - Wu-Jing.org|work=wu-jing.org| date = 8 March 2010| url = http://www.wu-jing.org/happenings/archives/795-Donnie-Yen-Has-Had-Enough-of-Ip-Man.html| accessdate = 29 March 2010}}</ref>  While both Donnie Yen and Raymond Wong are not keen on making a third Ip Man film, director Wilson Yip has expressed interest in making one that would focus on the relationship between Ip and Bruce Lee.
