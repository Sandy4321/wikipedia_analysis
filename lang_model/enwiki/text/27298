'''Holkham National Nature Reserve''' is England's largest [[National Nature Reserves in the United Kingdom|National Nature Reserve]] (NNR). It is on the [[Norfolk]] coast between [[Burnham Overy|Burnham Overy Staithe]] and [[Blakeney, Norfolk|Blakeney]], and is managed by [[Natural England]] with the cooperation of the [[Holkham Hall|Holkham Estate]]. Its 3,900&nbsp;ha (9,600&nbsp;acres) comprise a wide range of [[habitat (ecology)|habitats]], including [[grazing marsh]], woodland, [[salt marsh]], [[dune|sand dunes]] and [[intertidal zone|foreshore]]. The reserve is part of the [[North Norfolk Coast Site of Special Scientific Interest]], and the larger area is additionally protected through [[Natura 2000]], [[Special Protection Area]] (SPA) and [[Ramsar Convention|Ramsar]] listings, and is part of both an [[Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty]] (AONB) and a [[World Network of Biosphere Reserves|World Biosphere Reserve]]. Holkham NNR is important for its wintering [[Anatidae|wildfowl]], especially [[Pink-footed Goose|Pink-footed Geese]], [[Eurasian Wigeon]] and [[Brant Goose|Brent Geese]], but it also has breeding [[wader]]s, and attracts many [[bird migration|migrating birds]] in autumn. A number of scarce [[invertebrate]]s and plants can be found in the dunes, and the reserve is one of only two sites in the UK to have an [[Euroleon nostras|antlion]] colony.

This stretch of coast originally consisted of salt marshes protected from the sea by ridges of [[shingle beach|shingle]] and sand, and Holkham's [[Iron Age]] fort stood at the end of a sandy spit surrounded by the tidal wetland. The [[Viking]]s navigated the creeks to establish [[Holkham]] village, but access to the former harbour was stopped by drainage and reclamation of the marshes between the coast and the shingle ridge which started in the 17th century, and was completed in 1859. The Holkham estate has been owned by the Coke family, later [[Earl of Leicester|Earls of Leicester]] since 1609, and their seat at [[Holkham Hall]] is opposite the reserve's Lady Anne's Drive entrance. The [[Thomas Coke, 3rd Earl of Leicester|3rd Earl]] planted pines on the dunes to protect the pastures reclaimed by his predecessors from wind-blown sand. The National Nature Reserve was created in 1967 from 1,700&nbsp;ha (4,200&nbsp;acres) of the Holkham Estate and 2,200&nbsp;ha (5,400&nbsp;acres) of foreshore belonging to the [[Crown Estate|Crown]].

The reserve has over 100,000 visitors a year, including [[birdwatching|birdwatchers]], horse riders and [[naturism|naturists]], and is therefore significant for the local economy. The NNR has taken steps to control entry to the fragile dunes and other areas important for their animals or plants because of the damage to sensitive habitats that could be caused by unrestricted access. The dunes are an essential natural defence against the projected rises in sea level along this vulnerable coast.

The [[salt marsh]]es on this coast are stated in the [[Site of Special Scientific Interest]] (SSSI) notification document to be "among the best in Europe&nbsp;...&nbsp;the flora is exceptionally diverse". Holkham also has good examples of [[dune|sand dunes]], and the [[pine]]s planted on the dunes have provided shelter for other trees and shrubs to become established, making this the only substantial area of woodland in the North Norfolk Coast SSSI.<ref name = encitation/> The dunes are created and altered by the elements, and the sand islands in Holkham Bay were formed only within the last 60 years.<ref name = holkham/> The flat ground inland from the dunes is reclaimed salt marsh that was used as [[pasture]] until the 1940s, but converted  to [[arable land]] during [[World War II]].

== History ==

[[File:Holkham iron age fort.jpg|alt= field with raised grass track leading to distant mound|The mound of Holkham fort is visible at the end of the raised track, formerly its only access.|thumb|left]]
Norfolk has a long history of human occupation. Both [[anatomically modern humans|modern]] and [[Neanderthal]] people were present in the area between 100,000 and 10,000&nbsp;years ago, before the last [[glacial period|glaciation]], and humans returned as the ice retreated northwards. The [[Archaeology|archaeological]] record is poor until about 20,000 years ago, partly because of the then prevailing very cold conditions, but also because the coastline was much further north than at present. As the ice retreated during the [[Mesolithic]] (10,000<U+2013>5,000&nbsp;BCE), the [[sea level]] rose, filling what is now the [[North Sea]]. This brought the Norfolk coastline much closer to its present line, so that many ancient sites are now under the sea in an area now known as [[Doggerland]].<ref name = coles>{{cite web| author = Coles, Bryony | title= The Doggerland project | work= Research projects  | url= http://humanities.exeter.ac.uk/archaeology/research/projects/title_89282_en.html | publisher= University of Exeter }} Retrieved 18 September 2012.</ref><ref name= NAE9>Robertson ''et al.''

A large [[Iron Age]] fort at the end of a sandy spit in the marshes could only be approached along the spit; it enclosed 2.5&nbsp;ha (6.1&nbsp;acres) and remained in use until the defeat of the [[Iceni]] in 47&nbsp;AD.<ref name = ironagefort>{{cite web| author = | title= Iron Age fort 900m north east of Dale Hole Cottage | work= List entry summary | url=http://list.english-heritage.org.uk/resultsingle.aspx?uid=1018014 | publisher= English Heritage}} Retrieved 20 August 2012.</ref> The [[Viking]]s navigated the tidal creeks to establish Holkham, the name deriving from the Danish for "ship town".<ref name = holkhamestatemain/>

The [[Thomas Coke, 3rd Earl of Leicester|3rd Earl]] planted [[Pinus nigra|Corsican]], [[Maritime Pine|maritime]] and [[Scots Pine|Scots pines]] on the dunes in the late 19th century to shelter the agricultural land from wind-blown sand,<ref name = holkham/><ref name = holkhamestatemain/> which is carried inland when the wind speed exceeds three metres (10&nbsp;ft) per second and blows from directions between northwest to northeast.<ref name= Oronsaye>{{cite journal | last= Oronsaye | first= W I  | year= | title=  Wind action and sand movement near Holkham Bay, North Norfolk Coast, England | journal= Environmental Geology and Water Sciences | volume= 15 | issue = 2 | pages= 77<U+2013>82 | url = |format = | doi =  }}</ref>

The Holkham National Nature Reserve was created in 1967 from 1,700&nbsp;ha (4,200&nbsp;acres) of the Holkham Estate and 2,200&nbsp;ha (5,400&nbsp;acres) of intertidal sand and mud flats belonging to the [[Crown Estate]].<ref name= allen148>Allen & Pye (1992) p. 148.</ref> In 1986 the NNR was subsumed into the newly created 7,700-hectare (19,000-acre) North Norfolk Coast SSSI.

On exposed parts of the coast, the muds and sands are scoured by the tides, and have no vegetation except possibly [[algae]] or [[Zostera marina|eelgrass]], but where the shoreline is more protected, internationally important salt marshes can form, with several uncommon species. The salt marsh contains [[Salicornia|glassworts]] and [[Suaeda maritima|annual seablite]] in the most exposed regions,<ref name= holkham/> with a [[ecological succession|succession]] of plants following on as the marsh becomes more established: first [[Aster tripolium|sea aster]], then mainly [[Limonium binervosum|sea lavender]], with [[Halimione portulacoides|sea purslane]] in the creeks and smaller areas of [[Plantago maritima|sea plantain]] and other common marsh plants.<ref name = encitation/> [[Suaeda vera|Scrubby sea-blite]] and [[Limonium bellidifolium|matted sea lavender]] are characteristic plants of the drier upper salt marsh here, although they are uncommon in the UK away from the Norfolk coast.<ref name= holkham/>

Grasses such as [[Agropyron pungens|sea couch grass]] and [[Puccinellia maritima|sea poa grass]] are important in the driest areas of the marshes, and on the coastal dunes, where [[Ammophila arenaria|marram grass]], [[Elymus farctus|sand couch-grass]], [[Leymus arenarius|lyme-grass]] and [[Festuca rubra|red fescue]] help to bind the sand.

[[File:Horses on Holkham beach - geograph.org.uk - 543980.jpg|thumb|alt=horse and rider on a sandy beach|The reserve has many visitors every year, including horse riders on the beach.]]
A 2005 survey at Holkham and five other North Norfolk coastal sites found that 39&nbsp;per cent of visitors gave [[birdwatching]] as the main purpose of their visit. The 7.7&nbsp;million day visitors and 5.5&nbsp;million who made overnight stays in the area in 1999 are estimated to have spent <U+00A3>122&nbsp;million, and created the equivalent of 2,325 full-time jobs. Holkham NNR is one of three sites within the SSSI that attract 100,000 or more visitors annually, the others being [[Titchwell Marsh]] and [[Cley Marshes]].<ref name =liley4/> The large number of visitors at coastal sites sometimes has negative effects. Wildlife may be disturbed, a frequent difficulty for species that breed in exposed areas such as Ringed Plovers and Little Terns, and also for wintering geese. Plants can be trampled, which is a particular problem in sensitive habitats such as sand dunes and vegetated shingle.<ref name =liley10>Liley (2008) pp. 10<U+2013>14.</ref> The discovery of the nationally rare [[Geastrum minimum|tiny earthstar]] [[fungus]] at Holkham led its finders to state that "The survival of this species in Britain would undoubtedly benefit from the construction of a boardwalk across this fragile and frequently-visited habitat."<ref name= telfer>{{cite journal | last= Telfer | first= Mark G | coauthors= Lambdon, Philip W; Gurney, Mark | year=2000 | title= Recent discoveries among the gasteroid fungi of Norfolk | journal= Field Mycology | volume= 1 | issue = 1 | pages= 30<U+2013>32 | doi =10.1016/S1468-1641(10)60011-4}}</ref>

The Norfolk Coast Partnership, a grouping of conservation and environmental bodies, divide the coast and its [[hinterland]] into three zones for tourism development purposes. Holkham dunes, along with [[Holme Dunes]] and [[Blakeney Point]], were considered to be sensitive habitats already suffering from visitor pressure, and were designated as red-zone areas with no development or parking improvements to be recommended.

Half the area of the salt marshes that formed in the lee of Scolt Head Island has been reclaimed in the last 300 years, creating ecologically important, but very fragile, grazing marshes. Although Holkham is low-lying and can flood in severe weather conditions, it is protected by the spit that developed at the Holkham Gap in the 1990s and the dunes along the coast, which are increasingly being stabilised by vegetation.<ref name = smp15>East Anglia Coastal Group (2010) pp. 15<U+2013>18.</ref> The [[Environment Agency|Environment Agency's]] management plan until 2105 is to rely on the natural protection of the dunes, intervening only if work is necessary to maintain their effectiveness in the face of a potential sea level rise of 1.1&nbsp;m (3&nbsp;ft) by that date.<ref name = smp15/><ref name = smp80>East Anglia Coastal Group (2010) p. 80.</ref> The shingle that makes up Scolt Head Island is moving westwards and southwards at up to 3.5&nbsp;m (10&nbsp;ft) per year. This may affect the movement of [[sediment]], and lead to some erosion of the dunes and beaches at Holkham, but should not destroy their effectiveness as a sea defence unless the island reattaches to the mainland at some date in the distant future.<ref name= smp532/>
