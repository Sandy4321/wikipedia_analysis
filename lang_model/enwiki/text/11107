'''HMCS ''Capilano''''' was a [[River-class frigate]] that served with the [[Royal Canadian Navy]] during the [[Second World War]]. She served primarily as a convoy escort in the [[Battle of the Atlantic]]. She is named for [[Lake Capilano]] in [[North Vancouver (district municipality)|North Vancouver, British Columbia]]. The navy intended to name the ship after North Vancouver, however due to possible confusion with {{HMCS|Vancouver|K240|6}}, she was named after the lake.<ref name=Macpherson>{{cite book |last=Macpherson |first=Ken |last2=Burgess |first2=John |year=1981 |title=The ships of Canada's naval forces 1910-1981 : a complete pictorial history of Canadian warships |publisher=Collins |location=Toronto|pages= |isbn=0-00216-856-1}}</ref>

''Capilano'' was ordered on 1 February 1943 as part of the 1943-44 River-class building program.<ref name=Macpherson/><ref name=uboat>{{cite web|url=http://uboat.net/allies/warships/ship/200.html|work=uboat.net |title=HMCS Capilano (K 409) |accessdate=27 March 2014}}</ref> She was laid down on 18 November 1943 by [[Yarrows Limited|Yarrows Ltd.]] at [[Esquimalt, British Columbia|Esquimalt]] and launched 8 April 1944.<ref name=uboat/> ''Capilano'' was commissioned into the RCN on 25 August 1944 at [[Victoria, British Columbia]].<ref name=Macpherson/><ref name=uboat/>

==War service==
After commissioning, ''Capilano'' transited to [[Halifax, Nova Scotia|Halifax]] and worked up initially in St. Margaret's Bay before completing them at [[Bermuda]]. In November 1944 she was assigned to the [[Mid-Ocean Escort Force]] (MOEF) escort group C-2 as a trans-Atlantic convoy escort. She continued in this capacity until the end of the conflict in Europe at which point she returned to [[Canada]] in June 1945 and upon arrival, began her tropicalization refit for possible deployment to the [[Pacific Ocean]]. The refit was completed on 10 October, however by this point, [[Japan]] had surrendered and on 24 November 1945, she was paid off and placed in reserve at Bedford Basin.<ref name=Macpherson/>

==Postwar service==
''Capilano'' was sold for mercantile use in 1947 and underwent conversion. In 1948 she reappeared as the [[Jamaica]]n-registered ''Irving Francis M.'' In 1953, while under tow from Jamaica to [[Miami]], she foundered off the coast of [[Cuba]].<ref name=Macpherson/> In 2010, a framed photo of the ship and its badge was presented to the City of North Vancouver to mark the Canadian Naval Centennial.<ref name=Centennial>{{cite web|url=http://www.cnv.org/attach/2010%2007%2012-Pres-Ra.pdf |title=Naval Centennial marked with ship named for North Vancouver |work=City of North Vancouver |date=6 July 2010 |accessdate=27 March 2014}}</ref>
