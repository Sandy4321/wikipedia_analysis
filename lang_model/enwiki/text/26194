'''''Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope''''', originally released as '''''Star Wars''''', is a [[1977 in film|1977]] [[science fantasy]] [[film]] written and directed by [[George Lucas]]. It is the first of six films released in the ''[[Star Wars]]'' saga; three later films precede the story in the series' [[Dates in Star Wars|internal chronology]]. Among fans, the title is commonly abbreviated as "'''ANH'''."<ref>{{cite web | author=| year=| title=Star Wars and Star Trek Sources and Abbreviations| format= | work=Stardestroyer.net | url=http://www.stardestroyer.net/Empire/Misc/Sources_and_Abbreviations.html | accessdate=2006-07-31}}</ref>

Inspired by films like the ''[[Flash Gordon (serial)|Flash Gordon]]'' serials and such literary works as ''[[The Hero with a Thousand Faces]]'', Lucas began work on ''Star Wars'' in 1974. Produced with a budget of [[US$]]11 million and released on [[May 25]], [[1977]], the film became one of the most successful of all time, earning US$215 million in the [[United States]] and US$337 million overseas during its original theatrical release, as well as winning several film awards, including 10 [[Academy Award]] nominations. It was re-released several times, sometimes with [[List of changes in Star Wars re-releases|significant changes]]; the most notable versions were the 1997 Special Edition and the 2004 [[DVD]], which were modified with [[Computer Generated Imagery|CGI]] effects and recreated scenes.

In the final development of the series' chronology, the episode is set 19 years after the formation of the [[Galactic Empire (Star Wars)|Galactic Empire]]. Construction has finished on the [[Death Star]], a weapon capable of destroying a planet. After [[Princess Leia]], a leader of the [[Rebel Alliance]], receives the weapon's plans in the hope of finding a weakness, she is captured and taken to the Death Star. Meanwhile, a young farmer named [[Luke Skywalker]] meets [[Obi-Wan Kenobi]], who has lived in seclusion for years on the desert planet of [[Tatooine]]. When Luke's home is destroyed, Obi-Wan begins Luke<U+2019>s [[Jedi]] training as they attempt to rescue the Princess from the Empire.

== Production ==
During post-production on his previous film ''[[American Graffiti]]'', George Lucas discussed the concept of a "[[space opera]]" with producer [[Gary Kurtz]].<ref name="EmpireOfDreams"> ''Empire of Dreams: The Story of the Star Wars Trilogy'' Star Wars Trilogy Box Set DVD documentary, [2005]</ref> In May 1973, Lucas had prepared a fourteen-page story outline for distribution among film studios.  Because of its outer-space setting, the story was viewed as science fiction, an unpopular genre at the box office. Lucas later proposed that terms like "space fantasy" or "science fantasy" better fit the story.<ref name="EmpireOfDreams"/> He brought the outline to [[Universal Studios]] and [[United Artists]]; both rejected the project. Lucas disliked the studio system because his previous two films, ''American Graffiti'' and ''[[THX 1138]]'', had been re-edited without his consent.<ref name="Wired">{{cite web | work=Wired Magazine|author=Steve Silberman|date= | title=Life After Darth|url=http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/13.05/lucas_pr.html| accessdate=2006-10-01}}</ref> Still, aware that studios were unavoidable, he pursued [[Alan Ladd, Jr.]], the then-new head of [[20th Century Fox]]. Although Ladd failed to grasp the technical side of the project, he believed that Lucas was talented. Lucas later stated that Ladd "invested in me, [but] he did not invest in the movie."<ref name="EmpireOfDreams"/>

Lucas finished a draft of the screenplay in May 1974. As the draft developed, the characters evolved significantly. Early in development, Luke Skywalker's character changed from a 60-year-old general to a member of a family of [[midgets]];<ref name="EmpireOfDreams"/><ref name="Characters">''The Characters of Star Wars'' Star Wars Original Trilogy DVD Box Set: Bonus Materials, [2004]</ref> the [[Corellia]]n smuggler, [[Han Solo]], was envisioned as a large, green-skinned monster with gills.<ref name="Characters"/> [[Chewbacca]] was inspired by Lucas' [[Alaskan malamute]] dog, Indiana, who often acted as the director's "co-pilot" by sitting in the passenger seat of his car.<ref name="Characters"/> [[The Force (Star Wars)|The Force]], a mysterious energy field, was initially conceived as the Kyber crystal, a "galactic holy grail".<ref name="Genesis">{{cite web | work=Star Wars Genesis|author=Randy Lofficier, Jean-Marc Lofficier|date=1999 | title=The Star Wars Genesis: How the Classic SF Saga Evolved|url=http://www.lofficier.com/starwars.htm| accessdate=2006-10-01}}</ref><ref name="EmpireOfDreams"/> The completed script was too long for one movie; however, Lucas refused to condense it. Instead, he expanded the first third of it into one movie and left the rest for two future films, effectively creating the original ''Star Wars'' trilogy.<ref name="Maker">{{cite web | work=Starwars.com|author=|date=April 19, 2005 | title=Thank the Maker: George Lucas|url=http://www.starwars.com/community/event/celebration/f20050419/indexp17.html| accessdate=2006-10-01}}</ref><ref name="EmpireOfDreams"/>

Lucas hired conceptual artist [[Ralph McQuarrie]] to create paintings of certain scenes during screenwriting. When Lucas delivered his screenplay to the studio, he included several of McQuarrie's paintings.<ref name="McQuarrie">{{cite web | work=Starwars.com|author=|date= | title=Star Wars Biography: Ralph McQuarrie |url=http://www.starwars.com/bio/ralphmcquarrie.html| accessdate=2006-10-01}}</ref> 20th Century Fox approved a budget of $8,250,000; ''American Graffiti''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s positive reviews allowed Lucas to renegotiate his deal with Alan Ladd, Jr. and request the sequel rights to the film.

In 1975, Lucas founded the visual effects company [[Industrial Light & Magic]] (ILM) after discovering that 20th Century Fox's visual effects department had been disbanded. ILM began its work on ''Star Wars'' in a warehouse in [[Van Nuys, California]]. Most of the visual effects used [[motion control photography]], which creates the illusion of size by employing small models and slowly moving cameras. Model spaceships were constructed on the basis of drawings by [[Joe Johnston]], input from Lucas, and paintings by Ralph McQuarrie. Lucas opted to abandon the traditional sleekness of science fiction by creating a "used universe" in which all devices, ships, and buildings looked aged and dirty.<ref name="EmpireOfDreams"/><ref name="Legacy">''The Force Is With Them: The Legacy of Star Wars'' Star Wars Original Trilogy DVD Box Set: Bonus Materials, [2004]</ref><ref>{{cite web | work=Starwars.com | title=Star Wars Biography: Industrial Light & Magic | url=http://www.starwars.com/bio/industriallightmagic.html| accessdate=2006-10-01}}</ref>

When filming began on [[March 22]], [[1976]] in the North African [[Tunisia]]n desert for the scenes on the planet [[Tatooine]],<ref>{{cite web | work=IMDB | title=Business Data for Star Wars (1977) | url=http://us.imdb.com/title/tt0076759/business| accessdate=2006-10-02}}</ref> the project faced several problems.<ref>{{cite web | work=IMDB | title=Filming Locations for Star Wars (1977) | url=http://us.imdb.com/title/tt0076759/locations| accessdate=2006-10-02}}</ref> Lucas fell behind schedule in the first week of shooting due to a rare Tunisian rainstorm, malfunctioning props, and electronic breakdowns.<ref name="Heritage">{{cite web | work=AmericanHeritage.com | title= How Star Wars Surprised the World | url=http://www.americanheritage.com/entertainment/articles/web/20060525-star-wars-george-lucas-movies-hollywood-luke-skywalker-darth-vader-american-graffiti-science-fiction-special-effects.shtml| accessdate=2006-10-02}}</ref> When actor [[Anthony Daniels]] wore the [[C-3PO]] outfit for the first time, the left leg piece shattered down through the plastic covering his left foot, stabbing him. After completing filming in Tunisia, production moved into the more controlled environment of [[Elstree Studios]], near London.<ref name="Heritage" /> However, significant problems, such as an uncaring [[Film crew|crew]] who had little interest in the film, still arose.<ref name="EmpireOfDreams"/><ref name="Heritage"/> Most of the crew considered the project a "children's film", rarely took their work seriously, and often found it unintentionally humorous. Actor [[Kenny Baker]] later confessed that he thought the film would be a failure. Harrison Ford found the film "weird", in that there was a Princess with buns for hair and what he called a "giant in a monkey suit" named Chewbacca. Ford also found the dialogue difficult, saying "You can type this shit, George, but you sure can't say it."<ref>{{cite web | work=HarrisonFordWeb.com | title=Harrison Ford quote | url=http://www.harrisonfordweb.com/quotes/| accessdate=2006-09-15}}</ref> 

Lucas clashed with [[Director of Photography]] [[Gilbert Taylor]], whom producer [[Gary Kurtz]] called "old-school" and "crotchety".<ref name="EmpireOfDreams"> ''Empire of Dreams: The Story of the Star Wars Trilogy'' Star Wars Trilogy Box Set DVD documentary, [2005]</ref> Moreover, with a background in independent filmmaking, Lucas was accustomed to creating most of the elements of the film himself. His camera suggestions were rejected by an offended Taylor, who felt that Lucas was over-stepping his boundaries by giving specific instructions. Lucas eventually became frustrated that the costumes, sets and other elements were not living up to his original vision of ''Star Wars''. He rarely spoke to the actors, who felt that he expected too much of them while providing little direction. His directions to the actors usually consisted of the words "faster" and "more intense".<ref name="EmpireOfDreams"> ''Empire of Dreams: The Story of the Star Wars Trilogy'' Star Wars Trilogy Box Set DVD documentary, [2005]</ref>

Alan Ladd, Jr. offered Lucas some of the only support from the studio; he dealt with scrutiny from [[Board of directors|board]] members over the rising budget and complex screenplay drafts. After the film became two weeks over schedule, Ladd, Jr. told Lucas that he had to finish production within a week or he would be forced to shut down production. The crew split into three units, led by Lucas, Kurtz, and production supervisor [[Robert Watts]], respectively. Under the new system, the project met the studio's deadline.<ref name="EmpireOfDreams"/><ref name="Heritage"/>

''Star Wars'' was originally slated for release in Christmas 1976; however, massive delays pushed the film's release to summer 1977. Already anxious about meeting his deadline, Lucas was shocked when his editor's first cut of the film was a "complete disaster". After attempting to persuade the original editor to cut the film his way, Lucas replaced the editor with [[Paul Hirsch]] and Richard Chew. He also allowed his then-wife [[Marcia Lucas]] to aid the editing process while she was cutting the film ''[[New York, New York (film)|New York, New York]]'' with Lucas' friend [[Martin Scorsese]]. Richard Chew found the film had an unenergetic pace; it had been cut in a by-the-book manner: scenes were played out in [[master shot]]s that flowed into [[close-up]] coverage. He found that the pace was dictated by the actors instead of the cuts. Hirsch and Chew worked on two reels simultaneously; whoever finished first moved on to the next.<ref name="EmpireOfDreams"/> 

During production, the cast attempted to make Lucas laugh or smile as he often appeared depressed. At one point, the project became so demanding that Lucas was diagnosed with hypertension and exhaustion and was warned to reduce his stress level.<ref name="EmpireOfDreams"/><ref name="Heritage"/> [[Post-production]] was equally stressful due to increasing pressure from 20th Century Fox. Moreover, [[Mark Hamill]]'s face was injured in a car accident, which made reshoots impossible.<ref name="Heritage"/> 

Meanwhile, ILM was struggling to achieve unprecedented special effects. The company had spent half of its budget on four shots that Lucas deemed unacceptable.<ref name="Heritage"/> Moreover, theories surfaced that the workers at ILM lacked discipline, forcing Lucas to frequently intervene to ensure that they were on schedule.<ref name="EmpireOfDreams"/> With hundreds of uncompleted shots remaining, ILM was forced to finish a year's work in six months. Lucas inspired ILM by editing together aerial [[dogfight]]s from old war films, which enhanced the pacing of the scenes.<ref name="EmpireOfDreams"/>

During the chaos of production and post-production, the team made decisions about character voicing and [[sound effect]]s. Sound designer [[Ben Burtt]] had created a library of sounds that Lucas referred to as an "organic soundtrack". For Chewbacca's growls, Burtt recorded and combined sounds made by dogs, bears, lions, tigers, and walruses to create phrases and sentences. Lucas and Burtt created the robotic voice of [[R2-D2]] by filtering their voices through an electronic synthesizer. [[Darth Vader]]'s breathing was achieved by Burtt breathing through the mask of a [[scuba set|scuba]] tank implanted with a microphone.<ref name="Silicon">{{cite web | work=Silicon Valley Radio | title= Interview with Ben Burtt | url=http://www.transmitmedia.com/svr/burtt/index.html| accessdate=2006-10-03}}</ref> Lucas never intended to use the voice of [[David Prowse]], who portrayed Darth Vader in costume, because of Prowse's English [[West Country]] accent. He originally wanted [[Orson Welles]] to speak for Darth Vader. However, he felt that Welles' voice would be too recognizable, so he cast the lesser-known [[James Earl Jones]].<ref>{{cite web | work=Premiere Magazine | title= The Force Wasn't With Them| url=http://www.premiere.com/features/2164/the-force-wasnt-with-them.html| accessdate=2007-02-16}}</ref> Nor did Lucas intend to use Anthony Daniels' voice for C-3PO. Thirty well-established voice actors, such as [[Stan Freberg]], read for the voice of the droid. According to Daniels, one of the major voice actors recommended Daniels' voice for the role.<ref name="EmpireOfDreams"/><ref name="Characters"/>

When Lucas screened an early cut of the film for his friends, among them directors [[Brian De Palma]] and [[Steven Spielberg]], their reactions were disappointing. Spielberg, who claimed to have been the only person in the audience to have enjoyed the film,<ref name="EmpireOfDreams"/> believed that the lack of enthusiasm was due to the absence of finished special effects. Lucas later said that the group was honest and seemed bemused by the film. In contrast, Alan Ladd, Jr. and the rest of 20th Century Fox loved the film; one of the executives cried during screening. Lucas found the experience shocking and rewarding, having never gained any approval from studio executives before.<ref name="EmpireOfDreams"/> Although the delays ballooned the budget from $8 million to $11 million, the film was still the least expensive of the ''Star Wars'' saga.

== Plot ==
[[Image:A NEW HOPE-1 DVD no black bars.jpg|thumb|350px|[[Darth Vader]] and his stormtroopers board the Rebel [[CR90 Corellian Corvette|Corellian Corvette]] ''[[Tantive IV]]''.]]  
The [[Star Wars opening crawl|opening crawl]] reveals that [[Star Wars galaxy|the galaxy]] is in a state of [[Galactic Civil War|civil war]]. The [[Rebel Alliance]] has stolen plans to the [[Galactic Empire (Star Wars)|Galactic Empire]]'s [[Death Star]], a [[space station]] capable of annihilating a planet. The plans were transmitted to the rebel blockade runner [[Tantive IV]], a ship in the service of [[Princess Leia Organa]] of [[Alderaan]]. [[Imperial stormtrooper]]s take control of the ship, and [[Darth Vader]] arrives to assess the damage. Before she is captured, Leia uploads the plans and a [[holographic]] recording into a small [[Android|droid]] named [[R2-D2]]. R2-D2 and his partner, [[C-3PO]], board an escape pod and crash on the planet [[Tatooine]].

On Tatooine, the droids navigate the desert until they are captured by [[Jawas]]. The next day, the Jawas sell the droids to [[Owen Lars]] and his nephew, [[Luke Skywalker]]. Luke accidentally triggers part of the holographic message, making him suspect that R2-D2 is stolen property belonging to "[[Obi-Wan Kenobi]]." Returning to his garage at sunset, Luke discovers that R2-D2 has escaped. After finding him, Luke and C-3PO are attacked by [[Sandpeople]] and rescued by Obi-Wan Kenobi. Luke and the droids are brought to Obi-Wan's hut, where Obi-Wan tells of his days as a [[Jedi Knight]] and reveals to Luke that his father was also a Jedi skilled in a mysterious energy field called the [[Force (Star Wars)|Force]]. When Luke asks how his father died, Obi-Wan replies that he was "betrayed and murdered" by Darth Vader. After giving Luke his father's lightsaber, they view the holographic message from Princess Leia, who asks Obi-Wan to take the droid and the plans to the planet Alderaan. Obi-Wan invites Luke to accompany him to Alderaan; Luke refuses, citing his responsibility to his aunt and uncle. After returning home, Luke discovers that his family has been murdered and his home has been destroyed by Stormtroopers searching for the droids. He returns to Obi-Wan and decides to go to Alderaan and become a Jedi. At [[Mos Eisley Spaceport]], the group encounters a smuggler named [[Han Solo]], who agrees to transport them on his ship, the ''[[Millennium Falcon]]''. When Obi-Wan and his companions reach the ship, they are attacked by Stormtroopers. They hastily board the ''Millennium Falcon'', make a speedy launch, and dodge attacks in space before escaping to lightspeed.

Meanwhile, Leia has resisted interrogation on the Death Star. When threatened with the destruction of her home planet of [[Alderaan]], however, she bluffs and states that the Rebel Base is on [[Dantooine]]. [[Grand Moff Tarkin]] destroys Alderaan anyway, as a display of the Death Star's power. En route to Alderaan, Obi-Wan instructs Luke in the Force. When they arrive at Alderaan's location, the crew discovers only a hail of debris and a moon-sized space station - the Death Star. A [[tractor beam]] pulls the ''Falcon'' into the Death Star; inside, Obi-Wan attempts to disable it so that the group can escape. Upon learning that Leia is awaiting execution in a nearby [[prison cell]], the rest of the group navigates through the station and rescues the princess. After deactivating the tractor beam, Kenobi engages in a [[lightsaber]] duel with Vader. The duel distracts the guards, allowing Luke and his companions to board the ''Falcon''. Once he sees that they are safely near the ship, Obi-Wan allows Vader to strike him down. Luke screams in horror, gaining the attention of the Stormtroopers, who attack Luke and his companions.

[[Image:Trenchrunvaderkillanh.JPG|thumb|right|300px|left|Darth Vader prepares to gun down a Rebel starfighter during the perilous Trench Run.]]
The group escapes; unknown to them (but suspected by Leia), the Empire allowed the escape to track their ship to the Rebel Base. They travel to the Rebel hideout on [[Yavin IV]], where they deliver the plans to the Rebel leadership. After reviewing the battle plans, which involve flying along a canyon-sized trench in the station's surface and firing a torpedo down a narrow ventilation shaft, Luke and a group of Rebel fighters begin their assault on the approaching Death Star. Several squadrons of Rebel ships are destroyed by Imperial fighters as Luke's "Red" group begins its run down the trench towards the ventilation port. As Luke makes his run down the canyon, the voice of Kenobi instructs him to use the Force. When Vader locks his weapons onto Luke's X-Wing, Han Solo and Chewbacca fly in and destroy one of Vader's wingmen. Panicked, the second wingman hits Vader's ship and sends it spiraling into space. Luke, hearing Obi-Wan's voice, deactivates his targeting computer and launches torpedoes down the shaft, destroying the Death Star. In a civil ceremony at the Massassi Temple rebel base on Yavin IV, Luke and Han are awarded medals by Leia for their valor in the battle.

== Releases ==
Charles Lippincott was hired by Lucas' production company, [[Lucasfilm|Lucasfilm Ltd.]], as marketing director for ''Star Wars''. Because 20th Century Fox gave little support for marketing beyond licensing T-shirts and posters, Lippincott was forced to look elsewhere. He secured deals with [[Stan Lee]] and [[Marvel Comics]] for a comic book adaptation and with [[Del Rey Books]] for a novelization. Wary that ''Star Wars'' would be beaten out by other summer films, such as ''[[Smokey and the Bandit]]'', 20th Century Fox moved the release date to Wednesday before Memorial Day: [[May 25]], [[1977]]. However, few theaters ordered the film to be shown. In response, 20th Century Fox demanded that theaters order ''Star Wars'' if they wanted an eagerly anticipated film based on a best-selling novel titled ''[[The Other Side of Midnight]]''.<ref name="EmpireOfDreams"/><!--I don't know where to begin with this paragraph, it's still eluding me like all hell. I might as well give up-->

The film became an instant success; within three weeks of the film's release, 20th Century Fox's stock price doubled to a record high. Before 1977, 20th Century Fox's greatest annual profits were $37,000,000; in 1977, the company earned $79,000,000. Although the film's cultural neutrality helped it to gain international success, Alan Ladd, Jr. became anxious during the premiere in [[Japan]]. After the screening, the audience was silent, leading Ladd, Jr. to fear that the film would be unsuccessful. He was later told that, in Japan, silence was the greatest honor to a film. Meanwhile, thousands attended a ceremony at [[Grauman's Chinese Theatre]], where C-3PO, R2-D2 and Darth Vader placed their footprints in the theater's forecourt.<ref name="EmpireOfDreams"/> Although ''Star Wars'' merchandise was available to enthusiastic children upon release, only [[Kenner Toys]] <U+2014> who believed that the film would be unsuccessful <U+2014> had accepted Lippincott's licensing offers. A stunned Kenner responded to the sudden demand for toys by selling boxed vouchers in its "empty box" Christmas campaign; these vouchers could be redeemed for the toys in March 1978.<ref name="EmpireOfDreams"/> 

In 1978, at the height of the film's popularity, Smith-Hemion Productions approached Lucas with the idea of ''[[The Star Wars Holiday Special]]''. The end result is often considered a failure.<ref>{{cite web | work=TV Party| title= Star Wars on TV|url=http://www.tvparty.com/70starwars.html| accessdate=2006-09-02}}</ref>

The film was originally released as <U+2014> and consequently often called <U+2014> ''Star Wars'', without ''Episode IV'' or the subtitle ''A New Hope''. The [[1980 in film|1980]] sequel, ''[[Star Wars Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back]]'', featured the episode number and subtitle in the opening crawl. When the original film was re-released in 1981, ''Episode IV: A New Hope'' was added above the original opening crawl. Although Lucas claims that only six films were ever planned, representatives of Lucasfilm discussed plans for nine or twelve possible films in early interviews.<ref>[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,915986,00.html ''Time''] - March 6, 1978; "George Lucas' Galactic Empire - Get ready for Star Wars II, III, IV, V ..."</ref> The film was re-released theatrically in 1978, 1979, 1981, 1982, and 1997.

=== Special Edition ===
After ILM used [[computer generated imagery|computer generated effects]] for Steven Spielberg's ''[[Jurassic Park (film)|Jurassic Park]]'', Lucas concluded that digital technology had caught up to his original vision for ''Star Wars''.<ref name="EmpireOfDreams"/> As part of ''Star Wars''<nowiki>'</nowiki> 20th anniversary celebration in 1997, ''A New Hope'' was digitally remastered and re-released with ''[[Star Wars Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back|The Empire Strikes Back]]'' and ''[[Star Wars Episode VI: Return of the Jedi|Return of the Jedi]]'' under the campaign title ''The Star Wars Trilogy: Special Edition'', or ''SE''. The Special Edition versions contained visual shots and scenes that were unachievable in the original release due to financial, technological, and time restraints; one such scene involved a meeting between [[Han Solo]] and [[Jabba the Hutt]].<ref name="EmpireOfDreams"/> Although most changes were minor or cosmetic in nature, some fans believe that Lucas degraded the movie with the additions.<ref name="Changes">{{cite web | work=dvdactive | title=Star Wars: The Changes|url=http://www.dvdactive.com/editorial/articles/star-wars-the-changes-part-one.html?page=2| accessdate=August 14 | accessyear=2006}}</ref> For instance, a controversial change in which Greedo shoots first when confronting Han Solo has inspired T-shirts brandishing the phrase "[[Han Shot First]]".<ref name="HSF">{{cite web | work=Starwars.com | title=Exclusive T-shirts to Commemorate DVD Release|url=http://www.starwars.com/collecting/shop/shopnews/news20060503.html| accessdate=August 14 | accessyear=2006}}</ref>

=== DVD release ===
''A New Hope'' was released on [[DVD]] on September 21, 2004 in a box set with ''The Empire Strikes Back'', ''Return of the Jedi'', and a bonus disc of supplemental material. The movies were digitally restored and remastered, and [[list of changes in Star Wars re-releases#A New Hope 3|more changes were made]] by George Lucas.

The DVD features a commentary track from George Lucas, Ben Burtt, Dennis Muren, and Carrie Fisher. The bonus disc contains the documentary ''[[Empire of Dreams]]: The Story of the Star Wars Trilogy'', three featurettes, teaser and theatrical trailers, TV spots, still galleries, an exclusive preview of ''[[Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith]]'', a playable [[Xbox]] demo of the [[LucasArts]] game ''[[Star Wars Battlefront]]'', and a "Making Of" documentary on the [[Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith (video game)|''Episode III'' video game]]. The set was reissued in December 2005 as part of a three-disc "limited edition" boxed set without the bonus disc. 

The trilogy was re-released on separate two-disc Limited Edition DVD sets from [[September 12]], [[2006]] to [[December 31]], [[2006]]; the original versions of the films were added as bonus material. Controversy surrounded the release because the unaltered versions were from the 1993 non-[[anamorphic]] [[Laserdisc]] masters, and were not retransferred with modern video standards.<ref>{{cite web | author=Ian Dawe| year=| title=Anamorphic Star Wars and Other Musings| format= | work=Mindjack Film | url=http://www.mindjack.com/film/archives/2006_05_01_archive.html | accessdate=2006-05-26}}</ref>

Critics of Lucas have blamed ''Star Wars'' for "ruining" Hollywood by shifting its focus from "sophisticated" and "relevant" films such as ''The Godfather'', ''Taxi Driver'', and ''Annie Hall'' to films about "spectacle" and "juvenile fantasy".<ref name="American">{{cite web | work=Decent Films Guide|author=Steven D.

==Cinematic and literary allusions==
{{seealso|Star Wars sources and analogues}}
According to Lucas, the film was inspired by numerous sources, such as [[Beowulf]] and [[King Arthur]] for the origins of myth and world religions.<ref name="EmpireOfDreams"/> Lucas' originally wanted to rely heavily on 1930s ''[[Flash Gordon]]'' film serials; however, Lucas resorted to [[Akira Kurosawa]]'s film ''[[The Hidden Fortress]]'' and [[Joseph Campbell]]'s ''[[The Hero With a Thousand Faces]]'' because of copyright issues with ''Flash Gordon''.<ref name="Origins">{{cite web | work=Star Wars Origins | title=How did George Lucas create Star Wars?|url=http://www.spookybug.com/origins/index.html| accessdate=15 August | accessyear=2006}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | work= Muriel Verbeeck| title= Campbell, Star Wars and the myth |url=http://sw-anthropo.ibelgique.com/txt/camptexteanglais.html| accessdate=2006-10-02}}</ref> The scene in which Princess Leia awards Han and Luke is similar to a scene in [[Leni Riefenstahl]]'s 1934 film ''[[Triumph of the Will]]''; both scenes have large, enthusiastic crowds seated in a shallow [[amphitheatre]] bounded by columns, with a low [[dais]] where the leader stands.<ref>{{cite web | work=The Unordinary Star Wars Site | title=Star Wars and Triumph of the Will|url=http://alum.hampshire.edu/~jbfF95/swtotw.htm| accessdate=2006-09-02}}</ref>

[[Image:Triumph of the Will - Congress Hall.jpg|thumb|right|300px|A similar shot from [[Leni Riefenstahl]]'s ''[[Triumph of the Will]]''.]]
''Star Wars'' features several parallels to ''Flash Gordon'', such as the conflict between Rebels and Imperial Forces, the "[[wipe (transition)|soft wipes]]" between scenes, and the famous "[[Star Wars opening crawl|opening crawl]]" that begins each film. A concept borrowed from ''Flash Gordon'' <U+2014> a fusion of futuristic technology and traditional magic <U+2014> was originally developed by one of the founders of [[science fiction]], [[H.G. Wells]]. Wells believed the Industrial Revolution had quietly destroyed the idea that fairy-tale magic might be real. Thus, he found that plausibility was required to allow myth to work properly, and substituted elements of the Industrial Era: time machines instead of magic carpets, Martians instead of dragons, and scientists instead of wizards. Wells called his new genre "[[science fantasy|scientific fantasia]]".<ref>{{cite web | work=Star Wars Origins | title=Star Wars Origins - Flash Gordon|url=http://www.spookybug.com/origins/flash.html| accessdate=2006-09-02}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | work=U.

''Star Wars'' was influenced by the 1958 Kurosawa film ''[[The Hidden Fortress]]''; for instance, the two bickering peasants evolved into C-3PO and R2-D2, and a Japanese family crest seen in the film is similar to the Imperial Crest. Star Wars borrows heavily from another Kurosawa film, ''[[Yojimbo (film)|Yojimbo]]''. In both films, several men threaten the hero, bragging how wanted they are by authorities. The situation ends with an arm being cut off by a blade. Mifune is offered "twenty-five ryo now, twenty-five when you complete the mission." whereas Han Solo is offered "Two thousand now, plus fifteen when we reach Alderaan." Lucas' affection for Kurosawa may have influenced his decision to visit Japan in the early 1970s, where he borrowed the name "Jedi" from ''[[jidaigeki]]'' (which in English means "period dramas", and refers to films typically featuring [[samurai]]).<ref>{{cite web | work=Star Wars Origins | title=Star Wars Origins - Akira Kurosawa|url=http://www.spookybug.com/origins/kurosawa.html| accessdate=2006-09-02}}</ref><ref name="THX">{{cite web | work=Starwars.com | title= Before A New Hope: THX 1138 |url=http://www.starwars.com/episode-iv/bts/article/f20040810/index.html| accessdate=2006-09-03}}</ref><ref name="Rottencom">{{cite web | work=Rotten.com | title= Star Wars |url=http://www.rotten.com/library/culture/star-wars/| accessdate=2006-09-03}}</ref>

Lucas drew inspiration from [[J. R. R. Tolkien's]] [[fantasy]] book ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', in that Obi-Wan Kenobi is the [[Wizard (Middle-earth)|Wizard]] [[Gandalf]] reincarnate, albeit in differing fashions, and Darth Vader and the [[Witch-king of Angmar]] are the chief servants of a higher evil power and dress in black. Luke watches the duel of Obi-Wan and Vader from across a chasm as [[Frodo Baggins|Frodo]] witnessed the duel between Gandalf and the Balrog; both feature their respective blue and red melee weapons.<ref>{{cite web | work=Star Wars Origins | title=Star Wars Origins - The Lord of the Rings|url=http://www.spookybug.com/origins/lotr.html| accessdate=2006-09-02}}</ref>

Tatooine is similar to [[Arrakis]] from [[Frank Herbert]]'s book ''[[Dune (novel)|Dune]]''. Arrakis is the only known source of a longevity drug called the [[Melange|Spice Melange]]; [[Han Solo]] is a spice smuggler who has been through the spice mines of [[List of Star Wars planets (K-L)#Kessel|Kessel]]. Lucas' original concept of the film dealt heavily with the transport of spice, although the nature of the material remained unexplored. In the conversation at Obi-Wan Kenobi's home between Obi-Wan and Luke, Luke expresses a belief that his father was a navigator on a spice freighter. Other similarities include those between Princess Leia and Princess Alia ([[IPA chart for English|pronounced]] {{IPA|[<U+0259>.<U+02C8>li<U+02D0>.<U+0259>]}}), and between [[Jedi mind trick]]s and "The Voice", a controlling ability used by [[Bene Gesserit]]. In passing, Uncle Owen and Aunt Beru are "Moisture Farmers"; in ''Dune'', Dew Collectors are used by Fremen to "provide a small but reliable source of water".<ref>{{cite web | work=Star Wars Origins | title=Star Wars Origins - Frank Herbert's Dune|url=http://www.spookybug.com/origins/dune.html| accessdate=2006-09-02}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | work=D.

The Death Star assault scene was modeled after the 1950s movie ''[[The Dam Busters (film)|The Dam Busters]]'', in which [[Royal Air Force]] [[Avro Lancaster|Lancaster bombers]] fly along heavily defended reservoirs and aim "[[bouncing bomb]]s" at their manmade dams to cripple the heavy industry of the [[Ruhr]]. Some of the dialogue in ''The Dam Busters'' is repeated in the ''A New Hope'' climax; [[Gilbert Taylor]] also filmed the special effects sequences in ''The Dam Busters''.<ref>{{cite web | work=Star Wars Origins | title=Star Wars Origins - Miscellaneous Influences|url=http://www.spookybug.com/origins/other.html| accessdate=2006-09-02}}</ref><ref name="Rottencom"/> In addition, the sequence was partially inspired by the climax of the film ''[[633 Squadron]]'' directed by [[Walter Grauman]].<ref>{{cite web | work=Film, Music on the Web | title=Summer 2005 Film Music CD Reviews|url=http://www.musicweb-international.com/film/2005/Sum05/633sqdrn.html| accessdate=2006-09-02}}</ref>

The opening shot of ''Star Wars'', in which a detailed spaceship fills the screen overhead, is a nod to the scene introducing the interplanetary spacecraft ''[[Discovery One]]'' in [[Stanley Kubrick]]'s seminal [[1968 in film|1968 film]] ''[[2001: A Space Odyssey (film)|2001: A Space Odyssey]]''. The earlier big-budget science fiction film influenced the look of ''A New Hope'' in many other ways, including the use of [[extra-vehicular activity|EVA]] pods, hexagonal corridors, and primitive computer graphics.

== Soundtrack ==
{{Main|Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope (soundtrack)}}
On the recommendation of his friend [[Steven Spielberg]], Lucas hired composer [[John Williams]], who had worked with Spielberg on the film ''[[Jaws (film)|Jaws]]'', for which he won an [[Academy Award]]. Lucas felt that the film would portray visually foreign worlds, but that the musical score would give the audience an emotional familiarity. In March 1977, Williams conducted the London Symphony Orchestra to record the ''Star Wars'' soundtrack in twelve days.<ref name="EmpireOfDreams"> ''Empire of Dreams: The Story of the Star Wars Trilogy'' Star Wars Trilogy Box Set DVD documentary, [2005]</ref>

Lucas wanted a grand musical sound for ''Star Wars'', with [[leitmotif]]s to provide distinction. Therefore, he assembled his favorite orchestral pieces for the soundtrack, until John Williams convinced him that an original score would be unique and more unified. However, a few of Williams pieces were influenced by the tracks given to him by Lucas. The "Main Title Theme" was inspired by the theme from the 1942 film ''[[King's Row]]'', scored by [[Erich Wolfgang Korngold]], and the track "Dune Sea of Tatooine" drew from the soundtrack from ''[[Bicycle Thieves]]'', scored by Alessandro Cicognini.<ref name="Origins"/>

== Novelization ==
{{Main|Star Wars: From the Adventures of Luke Skywalker}}

The novelization of the film was published in December 1976, six months before the film was released. The credited author was George Lucas, but the book was revealed to have been [[ghostwriter|ghostwritten]] by [[Alan Dean Foster]], who later wrote the first [[Expanded Universe (Star Wars)|Expanded Universe]] novel, ''[[Splinter of the Mind's Eye]]''. The book was first published as ''Star Wars: From the Adventures of Luke Skywalker''; later editions were titled simply ''Star Wars'' and, later, ''Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope'', to reflect the retitling of the film. Certain scenes deleted from the film (and later restored or archived in DVD bonus features) were present in the novel, such as Luke at Tosche Station with Biggs and the encounter between Han and Jabba in Docking Bay 94. Other deleted scenes from the movie, such as a close-up of a stormtrooper riding on a [[Dewback]], were included in a photo insert added to later printings of the book.

Smaller details were also changed; for example, in the Death Star assault, Luke's callsign is Blue Five instead of Red Five as in the film. Charles Lippincott secured the deal with [[Del Rey Books]] to publish the novelization in November 1976. By February 1977, a half million copies had been sold.<ref name="EmpireOfDreams"/>

== Radio drama ==
{{Main|Star Wars (radio)}}

A [[Star Wars (radio)|radio drama]] adaptation of the film was written by [[Brian Daley]], directed by [[John Madden (director)|John Madden]], and produced for and broadcast on the American [[National Public Radio]] network in [[1981]]. The adaptation received cooperation from [[George Lucas]], who donated the rights to NPR. John Williams' music and Ben Burtt's sound design were retained for the show; Mark Hamill (Luke Skywalker) and Anthony Daniels (C-3PO) reprised their roles, as well. The radio drama featured deleted scenes of Luke Skywalker's observation of the space battle above Tatooine through binoculars, a skyhopper race, and Darth Vader's interrogation of Princess Leia. In terms of [[Star Wars canon|''Star Wars'' canon]], the radio drama is given the highest designation, G-canon.<ref>{{cite web | work=HighBridge Audio | title=Star Wars, the NPR dramatization|url=http://www.highbridgeaudio.com/starwars1.html| accessdate=2006-09-02}}</ref>
