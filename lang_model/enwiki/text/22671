'''''Barbeyella minutissima''''' is a [[slime mould]] [[species (biology)|species]] of the [[order (biology)|order]] [[Echinosteliales]], and the only species of the [[genus (biology)|genus]] '''''Barbeyella'''''. First described in 1914 from the [[Jura mountains]], its habitat is restricted to [[montane ecology|montane]] spruce and [[spruce]]-[[fir]] forests of the [[Northern Hemisphere]], where it has been recorded from Asia, Europe, and North America. It typically colonises slimy, [[algae]]-covered logs that have lost their bark and have been partially to completely covered by [[liverwort]]s. The [[sporangia]] are roughly spherical, up to 0.2&nbsp;mm in diameter, and supported by a thin stalk up to 0.7&nbsp;mm tall. After the [[spore]]s have developed, the walls of the sporangia split open into lobes. The species is one of the smallest members of the [[Myxogastria]] and is considered rare.

==Taxonomy and classification==

The species was first [[species description|described]] in 1914 by [[Charles Meylan]] on the basis of a collection made at an altitude of {{convert|1400|m}} from the Swiss [[Jura Mountains|Jura]] in September the year before. Meylan thought the species warranted a new genus based on the unique mode of dehiscence and the makeup of the capillitium.<ref name="Meylan 1914"/> The genus was named for the Swiss botanist [[William Barbey]] (1842<U+2013>1914).<ref name="JSTOR Plant Science"/> It and the genus ''[[Clastoderma]]'' together make up the family [[Clastodermataceae]].<ref name="Kirk 2008"/> Studies of the [[ultrastructure]] of the sporocarps suggests that ''Barbeyella'' occupies a systematic position intermediate between Echinosteliales and the [[Stemonitales]].<ref name="Schnittler 2000"/>

==Characteristics==
[[File:Rabenhorst Kryptogamen-Flora von Deutschland p.411.jpg|thumb|320px|right| a) sporangium<br>
b) through e) open sporangium<br>
b) from the side; c) and d) from above<br>
e) transparent peridium]]
The [[protoplasmodium]], a microscopic, undifferentiated granular mass with a slime sheath, is transparent and colourless. A single sporangiophore (the fruiting structure) is produced from the semispherical protoplasmodium, which is approximately one and a half times the diameter of mature [[sporangium|sporangia]]. It acquires dark spots as it matures and the centre of the [[protoplasm]] later becomes dark. Then, the transparent and milk-white protoplasmodium climbs along the stem to the top, where first the [[capillitium]] and [[peridium]] and finally the [[spore]]s are produced. At room temperature, this process lasts roughly one day.<ref name="hab"/>

The long-stemmed, blackish-brown or blackish-purple, barely translucent sporangia of ''Barbeyella'' are spherical, 0.15 to 0.2&nbsp;mm in diameter and together with the stem measure 0.3 to 0.7&nbsp;mm long. They are usually scattered on the [[substrate (biology)|substrate]], but also often grouped in loose,<ref name="baum"/> large colonies.<ref name="hab"/> The [[hypothallus]] (the tissue upon which the sporangiophore rests)  has a diameter of at least 0.7&nbsp;mm. Although not visible on mosses, it has a reddish-brown color when growing on wood. The brownish-black stem is up to 0.1&nbsp;mm thick, thinning to 5&nbsp;[[<U+00B5>m]] towards the top<ref name="baum"/> and is filled with protoplasmatic scrap material. The [[columella]] <U+2013> arising from the stem tip <U+2013> matures at the upper end at roughly half the height of the sporangiophore into 7 to 13 simple or occasionally bifurcated, 1 to 4&nbsp;<U+00B5>m large, dark-brown [[capillitium]] strands.<ref name="baum"/> Usually individual, occasionally in pairs, these are firmly fused with the lobed segments of the peridium, which are round in cross-section. When the spores mature, the sporangium splits and empties into the peridium towards the base. This prevents the lobes of the peridium from detaching and provides spore dispersal over a longer period, similar to a [[dehiscence (botany)|dehiscing]] [[capsule (botany)|capsule]].<ref name="hab"/> The sporangia are filled towards the top with plasmatic [[granule (cell biology)|granules]], which diminish increasingly towards the base. Depending on the size of the plasmatic granules, the sporangia appear [[wikt:papillate|papillate]] or smooth.<ref name="kry"/> 

The mass of spores is blackish brown,<ref name="baum"/> or brown if viewed under [[Polarized light microscopy|polarised light]]. The surface texture ranges from almost smooth to warty, and the spores measure 7<U+2013>9&nbsp;<U+00B5>m in diameter.<ref name="kry"/> Material collected from [[Oregon]], however, varies from European material in several ways: the fruit body is brown; the branching of the capillitium from the columella differs (having primary and secondary branches instead of radiating branches from an expanded tip); the spore mass is tan, and individual spores measure 10<U+2013>12&nbsp;<U+00B5>m.<ref name="Curtis 1968"/>

==Habitat and distribution==

''Barbeyella minutissima'' is considered rare.<ref name="myc"/> Its habitat corresponds to the mountainous spruce-fir forests of the Northern Hemisphere. It is largely restricted to altitudes between {{convert|500|and|2500|m|ft}}, occasionally appearing as low as sea level and as high as {{convert|3500|m|ft}}. It has been found in Europe (Finland, Germany, Switzerland, Poland, Romania,<ref name="hab"/> Latvia,<ref name="Adamontye 2006"/> and Russia),<ref name="Novozhilov 2010"/> in west and east North America ([[Washington (state)|Washington]], Oregon, [[California]], and Mexico; [[North Carolina|North]] and [[South Carolina]] and [[Virginia]]), in the Indian [[Himalaya]]s as well as in Japan.<ref name="hab"/> It is relatively common in fir forests on high-altitude Mexican volcanoes, suggesting that air-borne spore dispersal is effective.<ref name="Foissner 2009"/>

==Ecology==

The species grows only on slightly to heavily rotten and barkless deadwood in coniferous forests in cool, moist areas. The wood is about 40 to 100% overgrown with [[Marchantiophyta]], especially of the genera ''[[Nowellia]]'' or ''[[Cephalozia]]''. ''B.&nbsp;minutissima'' has been found growing on the liverwort ''[[Lepidozia reptans]]'',<ref name="Ing 1994"/> although ''[[Nowellia curvifolia]]'' is the main [[indicator species|indicator]] for the slime mould. In addition to liverworts, ''Barbeyella'' is found socialised with monocellular algae. It is assumed that the protoplasmodium [[Phagocytosis|phagocytises]] either the algae or the bacteria on their surface. Other [[Myxogastria]] species are often found together with ''Barbeyella'', especially ''[[Lepidoderma tigrinum]]'', ''[[Lamproderma columbinum]]'' and ''[[Colloderma oculatum]]''.<ref name="hab"/> ''[[Aphanocladium album]]'' is a myxomyceticolous fungus (i.e., living on or within the fruit bodies of myxomycetes) that has been reported growing on specimens of ''B.&nbsp;minutissima'' collected from North Carolina.<ref name="Rogerson 1993"/>
