'''AMI-t<U+00E9>l<U+00E9>''' is a [[Canada|Canadian]], French-language, [[digital cable]] [[specialty channel]] owned by the non-profit organization [[Accessible Media]]. AMI-t<U+00E9>l<U+00E9> broadcasts a selection of general entertainment programming with accommodations for those who are [[Visual impairment|visually]] or [[Deafness|hearing impaired]], consisting of [[described video]] on the primary audio track and [[closed captioning]] available across all of its programming. The channel also broadcasts series on accessibility- and disability-related topics.

AMI-t<U+00E9>l<U+00E9> is licensed by the [[Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission]] (CRTC) as a [[Category A services|Category A]] "[[must-carry]]" service; it must be carried on the lowest level of service by all licensed digital cable, [[Direct-broadcast satellite|satellite television]], and [[IPTV]] providers in Canada. An English-language version of the channel was launched on January 29, 2009, originally known as The Accessible Channel, the channel is now known as AMI-tv.

==History==
In January 2013, when the CRTC opened a new round of applications for must-carry channels, AMI submitted an application for a [[French-language]] sister channel of AMI-TV known as AMI-TV Fran<U+00E7>ais, which would have a similar format to its English-language counterpart. AMI justified the need for the channel by noting that the three provinces which host the majority of Canada's [[French language in Canada|francophone]] population<U+2014>[[New Brunswick]], [[Ontario]], and [[Quebec]]<U+2014>had above-average levels of vision loss and other vision-related conditions.<ref name=crtc-2013-19>{{cite web|title=Broadcasting Notice of Consultation CRTC 2013-19|url=http://crtc.gc.ca/eng/archive/2013/2013-19.htm|publisher=Canadian Radio-television and Communications Commission|accessdate=22 January 2013}}</ref> On August 8, 2013, the CRTC approved the application; the CRTC recognized that given the impact of AMI-tv's English service, a French service would have an equivalent impact on Canada's francophone community.<ref name=crtc-francaisdecision>{{cite web|title=Broadcasting Decision CRTC 2013-386|url=http://www.crtc.gc.ca/eng/archive/2013/2013-386.htm|publisher=Canadian Radio-television and Communications Commission|accessdate=9 August 2013}}</ref>
