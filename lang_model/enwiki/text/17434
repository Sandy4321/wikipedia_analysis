'''Ian Angus''' (born 18 April 1949) is a Canadian interdisciplinary philosopher and social critic who writes on [[continental philosophy]], [[Canadian studies]], [[communication theory]], [[social movements]], [[ecology|ecological thought]], and the university.

== Education ==

Angus holds B.A. and M.A. degrees in Philosophy from the [[University of Waterloo]] and a Ph.D. in Social and Political Thought from [[York University]] (1980). He has taught at the [[University of New Hampshire]], [[Trent University]] and [[University of Massachusetts]] at Amherst (1986-1992) and is currently a professor in the Department of Humanities at [[Simon Fraser University]] in British Columbia, Canada.{{fact}}

== Work ==

=== Continental Philosophy ===

Angus' early intellectual formation began with a dual engagement with 20th century [[phenomenology]], particularly the work of [[Edmund Husserl]], and the [[Frankfurt school]] of critical theory around the problems of technology and modern capitalism. Focusing on the notion of "[[instrumental rationality|instrumental reason]]" as a legitimating principle of technology, his first book ''Technique and Enlightenment'' (1984) argues for a form of technological assessment that is both ethical and acknowledges its role within the larger problematic of the construction of human identity.<ref>Timothy Casey, "I.A. Angus, "Technique and enlightenment: Limits of instrumental reason" (Book Review)," Husserl Studies, Vol. 3 (3) (January 1986):245-246.</ref> His subsequent work branched into a wider conception of the problem of [[modernity]] in critical engagement with [[discourse]] theory, [[post-structuralism]], and [[rhetoric|rhetorical]] theory. In ''Primal Scenes of Communication'' (2000) "the complex linguistic model Angus has created regards the immanent link of identity creation involved in communication theories, but <U+2026> his concerns deal with this struggle for, and the shaping of, our faculties of attention."<ref>Norman Madarasz, "Delivering our Attention: Ian Angus<U+2019> Primal Scenes of Communication," Symposium: Journal of the Canadian Society for Hermeneutics and Postmodern Thought, Vol. V, no. 2 (Fall 2001): 256-7.</ref>
=== Canadian Social Philosophy ===

Angus' commitment to Canadian social and political thought was a consequence of his estimation in the 1970s that the left wing of Canadian [[nationalism]] contained the possibility for a transformation of Canadian society in a more [[egalitarian]] direction. In his most influential book in the area of [[Canadian Studies]], ''A Border Within'' (1997), he works toward thinking English Canadian identity in relation to internal diversity and [[environmentalism|environmental]]-local embeddedness. He does so by exploring the question: "What are the possibilities for an English-Canadian national identity in an age of corporate globalization- a phenomenon that appears to undermine national identities around the world?"<ref>{{cite journal|first=Ronald |last=Glasberg |title=Review of A Border Within: National Identity, Cultural Plurality and Wilderness |journal=History of Intellectual Culture |volume=1 |issue=1 |year=2001 |url=http://www.ucalgary.ca/hic/issues/vol1/12}}</ref> Angus rejects the tendency to wholly situate identity as simply constructed locally or universally, but instead maintains that it is in the very acknowledgement of [[other|otherness]], both environmental and ethnic, that an English Canadian identity could be rethought.<ref>Thomas Dunk, "National Culture, Political Economy and Socio-Cultural Anthropology in English Canada," Anthropologica, Vol.42, No. 2 (2000): 131-145.</ref>
His subsequent book ''Identity and Justice'' (2008) traces political thought and cultural politics insofar as they are integrated into philosophy. "It is not a book about Canadian philosophy, but rather a philosophical book that self-consciously situates itself in a particular place, in order to talk about this place."<ref>Graeme Nicholson, "Review of Identity and Justice by Ian Angus," Modern Horizons June 20, (2012), http://www.modernhorizonsjournal.ca/June%202012.html</ref> In 2013, Angus published a collection of essays on Canada under the title ''The Undiscovered Country: Essays in Canadian Intellectual Culture'' through [[Athabasca University]] Press in which he collected together his critiques of Canadian thinkers and emphasized that a philosophy which does not criticize [[empire]] becomes [[ideology]].<ref>http://www.aupress.ca/index.php/books/120223</ref>
=== Love the Questions: The University and Transformations of Knowledge ===

Angus' work on the university draws on years of [[activism]] and public deliberation on the issues surrounding it.<ref>Maria Guglietti. "The University and a New Definition of Enlightenment," Topia 28 (2012): 306.</ref> He applies philosophical critique on an institutional level. This allows him to examine the transformation of knowledge as it relates to the external pressures of [[network]] [[capitalism]] and [[technoscience]].<ref>A selection from Chapter 6, "The Transformation of Knowledge," was printed in Truthout Magazine under the title, "Does the University Have a Future in Network Society?" (http://archive.truthout.org/does-university-have-a-future-network-society58477</ref> The contemporary university can be defined by "three separate questions focusing on teaching, research and application, and technological change."<ref>Bob Hanke. "Ian Angus in Conversation with Bob Hanke," Canadian Journal of Media Studies Vol. 7 June (2010): 1-16.</ref> Maria Victoria Guglietti's review explains that "the transmission of knowledge<U+2026>undermines enlightenment because it discourages any enquiry into the nature and limits of knowledge."<ref>Maria Guglietti. "The University and a New Definition of Enlightenment," Topia 28 (2012): 307.</ref> This amounts to the university loosing its "critical and self reflexive role"<ref>Alan Bourke. "Review of Ian Angus. Love the Questions: University Education and Enlightenment," Canadian Journal of Sociology On-Line Vol. 35 No. 3 (2010): 2.</ref> because its main purpose is to feed the specific needs of the larger system. This corporate arrangement of the university produces an anxiety as it relates to self-knowledge because of the explicit integration of education into the [[commodity]] form. Angus concludes with a realistic but hopeful analysis of the possibilities for the construction of new forms of [[enlightenment]] within the university. Though his work is primarily on the Canadian university, it has been widely praised for its applicability to the situation in the UK and US.<ref>http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/411128.article</ref>
