'''Rozalia Lubomirska''' ([[September 16]], [[1768]] - [[June 29]], [[1794]]) was a [[Poland|Polish]] [[noblewoman]], most noted for her death.

Born '''Rozalia Chodkiewicz''' in [[Chornobyl]], she was the daughter of Jan Miko<U+0142>aj Chodkiewicz and Maria Ludwika Rzewuska, who was a daughter of [[hetman]] and [[writer]] [[Wac<U+0142>aw Rzewuski]].

She was married in 1787 (at age of 19) to Ksi<U+0105><U+017C><U+0119> (Duke) Aleksander Lubomirski. A year later she bore their daughter, Aleksandra.

Known for her beauty, Rozalia traveled to [[France]] during the [[French Revolution|Revolution]] with her children, where she was arrested and tried for conspiracy against the Revolution and cooperation with the royalists. As a result, the 26-year-old duchess was sentenced to death and soon [[behead]]ed by [[guillotine]], although her guilt was, and remained, widely questioned.

After her death, Rozalia became the subject of legends. According to one, her ghost appears in Lubomirski's palace in [[Opole Lubelskie]]. The writer [[Adolf Dygasi<U+0144>ski]] claimed he saw her ghost.
