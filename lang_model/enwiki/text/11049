'''Hugh Findlay''' ([[Newmilns]], [[Ayrshire]], [[Scotland]], [[June 9]], [[1822]] &ndash;  [[March 2]], [[1900]] in [[Fish Haven, Idaho]]) was one of the first two [[Mormon missionary|Mormon missionaries]] to enter [[India]] and opened missionary work in the [[Shetland Islands]].

Findlay was baptized in [[Dundee]], [[Scotland]],<ref name=Hales/><ref>Findlay lived on Barrack Street in Dundee, Scotland.</ref> on [[July 1]], [[1844]], by missionaries from [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]]. He married Isabella Ratray that same year.<ref name=Pioneer>"The Mormons From Scotland and Wales: Others From Scotland". ''Our Pioneer Heritage''. Volume 13. Company E.</ref> Between 1847 and 1848, Isabella and the two little boys she and Findlay had together, James and Ephraim, died in what was probably a [[diptheria]] epidemic. Both boys were under two years old.<ref>"Eardley and Slaughter Family Tree". [http://worldconnect.rootsweb.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&db=:2259913&id=I712]. Accessed 13 August 2007.</ref> 

[[Orson Pratt]] recorded the following about a case of "miraculous healing" involving Findlay in Scotland:[[Image:Dundee Parish Church, St Mary's.jpg|thumb|180px|left|St Mary's Parish Church, Dundee, Scotland]]{{cquote|I have a girl, aged three years, who had for eighteen months been afflicted with convulsive fits ... the child was fearful to behold, almost in continual convulsions by night and day. On the 25th of December last, Elder Hugh Findlay called and [[Anointing|anointed her with oil]] in the name of the Lord and prayed for her, and from that day until now she has never had a fit... For the truth of which, witness our hands,

== Mission ==
Findlay and Willes arrived in 1851, seeking to build on reports from early members of the [[Plymouth Brethren]] that India would be a fertile ground for [[Proselytism|proselytization]]. However, almost immediately they were met by opposition from the established Protestant denominations, the press, and military officers and chaplains.<ref name=BYUstudies>Britsch, R. Lanier.

It took Findlay six months to baptize his first six converts. While in Bombay, he was restricted from all military areas ([[cantonment]]s) and was forbidden to preach to military personnel. In April 1852, he moved on to [[Poona]], 90 miles distant, where he was eventually granted permission to proselyte. The local cantonment commander reasoned that "the less these people are opposed the less harm they would do."<ref name=BYUstudies/> Findlay was eventually able to organize a branch of twelve members in Poona by mid-September 1852, a mixture of "[[European ethnic groups|European]], [[Eurasian]], and [[Demographics of India|native]]."<ref>''[[Millennial Star]]'' (London, England), Vol. XIV, pp. 635-36.</ref> However, in October Findlay was asked to leave the cantonment. He found new quarters in a small shelter in Poona, where he continued to hold meetings with the branch. Several months later, he completed a chapel directly across the street.<ref>''Millennial Star'' (London, England), Vol. XIV, pp. 654-55.</ref>

After being banished from the cantonment, Findlay focused his efforts almost exclusively on the native population. He studied the [[Marathi language]] and spent considerable time discussing religion with a group of [[Brahmin]] intellectuals.<ref name=BYUstudies/>

Hugh Findlay and his fellow missionaries ultimately found little success in India. He served in Poona and Bombay for several years, most of it alone.<ref>Britsch, R. Lanier.

In June 1862, Hugh Findlay's 19-year-old brother-in-law, Jared Smith, was killed in the [[Morrisite War]]. Smith had been engaged to Ane Marie Dorthea Nelson, a 19-year-old Danish immigrant. The next month, Findlay married Ane Marie. They had three children together and raised them as Jared's.

By 1864, Findlay was manufacturing and selling matches, wholesale and retail, at a location on Main Street in Salt Lake City.<ref>{{cite book |title=Almanac for the Year 1864 |last=Phelps |first=W.W. |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=1864 |publisher=Printed at Deseret News Office |location=Great Salt Lake City, Utah |isbn= |oclc= |pages=16 |quote=Hugh Findlay, First Prize Matches, wholesale and retail, west side of Main street, 14th ward; also blacking}}</ref> By the next year, he was also proprietor of a music store on East Temple Street.<ref>{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |author= |coauthors= |title=Advertisement |url= |format= |work=Salt Lake City Deseret News |publisher= |location= |id= |pages= |page= |date=Feb. 15, 1865 |quote=SOMETHING NEW IN UTAH!

== Later life ==

In the Fall of 1869, [[Brigham Young]] called Findlay and his families to help settle the [[Bear Lake (Idaho-Utah)|Bear Lake]] country. They arrived on [[May 22]], [[1870]], and along with [[Henry Howell (Latter Day Saints)|Henry Howell]] helped settle [[Fish Haven, Idaho]], where he later served as [[Bishop (Mormonism)|Bishop]].<ref name=Hales/> Ane Marie died in Fish Haven in [[1872]] at age 29.

In 1878 the church called him to open a mission in the [[Shetland Islands]], an [[archipelago]] northeast of [[Scotland]]. He arrived on [[January 4]], [[1879]], and within three months baptized the first two converts in the Shetland Islands, on March 31.<ref>Jensen, Andrew. ''Church Chronology: A Record of Important Events Pertaining to the History of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints''. 1914, p. 103. ISBN 1417968540.</ref>

On [[May 5]], [[1879]], [[Orson Pratt]] (who was also in the British Isles at the time) received a letter from [[John Taylor (Latter Day Saints)|John Taylor]], instructing him to obtain [[electroplate]]s for a new edition of the [[Doctrine & Covenants]]. Findlay and three other men helped him divide the text into verses and supply references.<ref>Davis, Marguirite R. ''History of John Ryder''. The Yancey Family Surname Resource Center. See [http://www.geocities.com/Heartland/Acres/7647/jrhist.htm].</ref>

While in Shetland he was asked to preside over the Scotland Mission. One history records: {{cquote|"He had no money with which to pay his steamboat passage to Scotland, but, true to his unwavering faith, he packed his suitcase, ready to obey, and walked toward the wharf where he was to sail. As he passed the post office, he asked for his mail and received a letter from a strange lady who wrote him of her interest in articles he had written for the Millennial Star and enclosed for him a five-pound note which was equal to about twenty-five dollars in American money."<ref name=Hales/>}}

He was released as president of the Scotland Mission in 1880. He returned to his families in Fish Haven, where he served as a [[Patriarch (Latter Day Saints)|Patriarch]]<ref name=Hales/> until his death on [[March 2]], [[1900]].
