'''HMAS ''Australia''''' was one of three [[Indefatigable class battlecruiser|''Indefatigable'' class battlecruisers]] built for the defence of the [[British Empire]]. Launched in 1911, ''Australia'' was commissioned into the [[Royal Australian Navy]] (RAN) as [[flagship]] in 1913, and is the only [[capital ship]] to serve in the RAN.

''Australia'' served in both the Pacific and Atlantic oceans during World War I. She became the first battlecruiser to [[naval aviation|carry and launch an aircraft]] in 1918, and on her return to Australia after the war in 1919, several of the crew abandoned their posts in an abortive mutiny.

''Australia'' was scuttled with her armament in 1924, as part of the British Empire's compliance conditions with the [[Washington Naval Treaty]], the only time a [[disarmament]] agreement has impacted on the Australian military.

==Construction and acquisition==
[[Image:HMASAustraliaOnDeliveryInUK1913.jpg|thumb|left|HMAS ''Australia'' on delivery in the UK in 1913]]
''Australia'' was laid down by [[John Brown and Company]] of [[Clydebank]], [[Glasgow]], Scotland on 26 June 1910.<ref name=SPC/> She was launched on 25 October 1911 by Lady Reid, wife of [[George Reid (Australian politician)|Sir George Reid]], the Australian [[High Commissioner (Commonwealth)|High Commissioner]] in London and former [[Prime Minister of Australia]].<ref name=SPC/> The battlecruiser was completed and commissioned into the RAN at Portsmouth on 21 June 1913 as the navy's flagship.<ref>Stevens, in ''The Royal Australian Navy'', p. 24</ref> At some point before departing England, Rear Admiral [[George Patey]], the British admiral assigned as the 'Flag Officer Commanding the Australian Fleet', was knighted by [[George V of the United Kingdom|King George V]] on ''Australia''<U+2019>s quarterdeck.<ref name=Stevens25>Stevens, in ''The Royal Australian Navy'', p. 25</ref>

''Australia'' is the only [[capital ship]] to serve in the RAN.<ref name=SPC/>{{ref|def|[I]}}

==Operational history==
On 21 July 1913, ''Australia'' departed for her namesake country in company with [[HMAS Sydney (1912)|HMAS ''Sydney'']].<ref name=Stevens25/> The ships arrived in Sydney on 4 October 1913, after a diplomatic visit to South Africa.<ref name=Stevens25/> ''Australia'' and ''Sydney'' had been ordered to avoid other Australian ports, in order to perform a ceremonial entry into Sydney with other ships of the RAN.<ref name=Stevens25/> On the same day, the role of Flagship of the [[Australia Station]] was transferred from [[HMS Cambrian (1893)|HMS ''Cambrian'']] to ''Australia'', which also marked the transfer of responsibility from the United Kingdom to Australia.<ref>Stevens, in ''The Royal Australian Navy'', p. 26</ref>

During her first year of service, ''Australia'' visited major ports along the south and east coastlines, in order to show the pride of the RAN to the public.<ref name=SPC/>

===World War I===
On receiving a warning from the United Kingdom on 30 July 1914 that a declaration of war in Europe was imminent, RAN ships exercising off Queensland, including ''Australia'', were recalled to Sydney to resupply.<ref>Stevens, in ''The Royal Australian Navy'', p. 30</ref> The battlecruiser was assigned to the China Station, but was authorised to first seek out and destroy any enemy warships operating in the area.<ref name=Stevens32>Stevens, in ''The Royal Australian Navy'', p. 32</ref> Following the declaration of war, ''Australia'' was assigned to find the [[German East Asia Squadron]], the only [[Central Powers]] naval force in the Pacific.<ref name=Stevens32/> During this hunt, the battlecruiser was attached to the [[Australian Naval and Military Expeditionary Force]] and provided support during the Force's invasion of [[Rabaul]], in case the German squadron was present.<ref name=Stevens32/> The squadron's commander, Vice Admiral [[Maximilian von Spee]], was wary of ''Australia'', which he described as being superior to his squadron.<ref>Stevens, in ''The Royal Australian Navy'', p. 33</ref>

Following von Spee's withdrawal from the Pacific, ''Australia'' was belatedly ordered to join a combined force off Mexico to resume the hunt for the German cruisers.<ref>Stevens, in ''The Royal Australian Navy'', pp. 36-7</ref> By this time, the German squadron had made its way to the South Atlantic, and in early December was destroyed by a separate allied squadron in the [[Battle of the Falkland Islands]].<ref name=Stevens37>Stevens, in ''The Royal Australian Navy'', p. 37</ref> ''Australia'' was sent to join the [[2nd Battlecruiser Squadron (United Kingdom)|2nd Battlecruiser Squadron]] at [[Rosyth]], Scotland, and was made flagship of the Squadron.<ref name=Stevens37/>

As part of the 2nd Battlecruiser Squadron, ''Australia'' was involved in a series of mostly uneventful patrols of the North Sea.<ref name=Stevens37/> ''Australia'' did not participate in the [[Battle of Jutland]]: at the time of the engagement, she was undergoing repairs to her armour plating following two successive collisions with sister ship [[HMS New Zealand (1911)|HMS ''New Zealand'']] while zigzagging in heavy fog on 22 June 1916.<ref name=Stevens37/><ref name=Oxcomp139>Dennis et al, ''The Oxford companion to Australian military history'', p. 139</ref> After returning to service on 9 June 1917, ''Australia'' resumed the duties of flagship of the 2nd Battlecruiser Squadron until the end of the war.<ref name=SPC/> ''Australia'' was involved in a second collision, with British battlecruiser [[HMS Repulse (1916)|HMS ''Repulse'']] in 12 December 1917, but was not heavily damaged.<ref name=Oxcomp139/> The battlecruiser did not encounter any enemy ships during the entire war, and an abortive attack on a suspected enemy submarine on 30 December 1917 was the only time her weapons were fired in anger.<ref name=Stevens37/> 
[[File:ATurretHMASAustralia1918.jpg|thumb|left|HMAS ''Australia'''s forward turret in 1918]]

In February 1918, eleven personnel from ''Australia'' were selected to participate in commando raids on two Belgian ports.<ref>Stevens, in ''The Royal Australian Navy'', p. 51</ref> The British Admiralty hoped to close the ports of [[First Ostend Raid|Ostend]] and [[Zeebrugge Raid|Zeebrugge]] using [[blockship]]s, although both raids were ultimately unsuccessful.<ref>Stevens, in ''The Royal Australian Navy'', p. 51-2</ref> Of the eleven RAN sailors involved, one was awarded the [[Distinguished Service Cross (United Kingdom)|Distinguished Service Cross]], three were awarded the [[Distinguished Service Medal (United Kingdom)|Distinguished Service Medal]], and three were [[mentioned in dispatches]].<ref name=Stevens52>Stevens, in ''The Royal Australian Navy'', p. 52</ref> One of the sailors receiving the Distinguised Service Medal was nominated for the [[Victoria Cross]], but did not receive it.<ref name=Stevens52/>

In March and May 1918, ''Australia'' was used for experiments with [[naval aviation|ship-bourne aircraft]].<ref name=SPC/> On 8 March, a [[Sopwith 1<U+00BD> Strutter]] biplane was launched from a platform mounted over one of the battlecruiser's 12-inch turrets; the first ever launching of an aircraft from a battlecruiser.<ref name=SPC/>

On 21 November 1918, ''Australia'' was present at the surrender of the German [[High Seas Fleet]].<ref name=Stevens52/> The battlecruiser led the port division of the [[Grand Fleet]] to meet the German fleet, and was tasked with specifically guarding the German battlecruiser [[SMS Hindenburg|SMS ''Hindenburg'']].<ref>Stevens, in ''The Royal Australian Navy'', p. 52-3</ref>

===Mutiny===
''Australia'' sailed for home on 23 April 1919, arriving in [[Fremantle, Western Australia|Fremantle]] on 28 May.<ref name=SPC/> On 1 June the "HMAS ''Australia'' mutiny" occurred.<ref name=AWM>''HMAS Australia mutiny'', Australian War Memorial</ref> The crew had been given four days leave, and when the crew was ordered to make preparations to sail, to comply with a schedule of "welcome home" ceremonies, over 80 sailors assembled on the quarterdeck and requesting that the departure be delayed to allow further shore leave in Fremantle and [[Perth, Western Australia|Perth]].<ref name=AWM/> Other believed causes for the crew's frustration were the monotonous duty and lack of action during the war, several misunderstandings relating to crew pay and enlistment periods, and rivalry between the Australian and British sections of the crew.<ref name=AWM/>

The group was addressed by Captain Claude Cumberlege, who listened to their concerns but informed them that the ship's departure could not be delayed due to the tight schedule.<ref name=SPC/><ref name=AWM/> The sailors dispersed unhappily but voluntarily, but when the orders came to sail, it was discovered that the duty [[stoker]]s had abandoned their posts, preventing ''Australia'' from departing.<ref name=Sears56/> Petty officers were ordered to the engine room and the ship left port only one hour late, with the incident spreading no further among the crew.<ref name=SPC/><ref name=AWM/> Cumberlege pressed charges against 32 men: 27 were imprisoned in cells onboard ''Australia'' for 90 days, while five (including the Victoria Cross nominee from the Zeeburgee raid) were court-martialled for mutiny after the battlecruiser's arrival in Sydney on 15 June, and were variously sentenced to between one and two years imprisonment, with hard labour and dismissal from service.<ref name=Sears56>Sears, in ''The Royal Australian Navy'', p. 56</ref><ref name=AWM/> After a public outcry, all five were released in December.<ref name=AWM/>

===Post-war===
After World War I, ''Australia'' resumed her peacetime role as the flagship of the RAN.<ref name=SPC/> In 1920, it was decided that the large amount of resources and manpower required for the ship could be used elsewhere, and that the ship's importance should be downgraded.<ref name=Sears65>Sears, in ''The Royal Australian Navy'', p. 65</ref> Another factor contributing to this was that the 12-inch shells used for the battlecruiser's guns were no longer being manufactured for the Royal Navy.<ref name=Sears65 /> ''Australia''<U+2019>s crew was downsized, and she was sent to Victoria and retasked as a gunnery and torpedo drill ship, with a secondary role as a defensive gun battery.<ref name=Sears65/>

==Decommissioning and fate==
[[File:HMAS Australia Scuttling.jpg|thumb|''Australia'' sinking off Sydney on 12 April 1924]]
In November 1921, ''Australia'' was returned to Sydney, and was decommissioned into reserve on 12 December 1921.<ref name=SPC/> Over the next three years, the ship was stripped of all useful equipment, as well as numerous souvenirs.<ref name=SPC>''HMAS Australia (I)'', Sea Power Centre</ref>

The [[Washington Naval Treaty]], signed in 1922, required the participating nations to downsize their naval forces.<ref name=Sears65/> As she was part of the British Empire, Australia was required to scuttle the battlecruiser with her main armament.<ref name=Sears65/> ''Australia'' was towed out to sea and scuttled on 12 April 1924,<ref name=Sears65/> an event that was seen as either the loss of a symbolic but obsolete part of the RAN, or as significantly weakening the navy's strength.<ref name=SPC2>''A Loss More Symbolic than Material?'', Sea Power Centre''</ref> The scuttling of Australia is the only time a [[disarmament]] treaty has impacted on the Australian military.<ref>Dennis et al, ''The Oxford Companion to Australian Military History'', p. 186</ref>
