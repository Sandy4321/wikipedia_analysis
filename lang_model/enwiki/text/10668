In April 1997, C.K. found himself running out of money to complete production.  On April 9, 1997, C.K. appeared on ''[[Late Night with Conan O'Brien]]'', showed a clip of ''Tomorrow Night'', and made a "tongue-in-cheek entreaty for funds" to finish the film.<ref name=ew98/>  C.K.'s friends [[Jon Stewart]], [[Dennis Leary]], [[Brett Butler (actress)|Brett Butler]], [[Spike Feresten]], [[Chris Rock]] lent him money to help finish the project, which ended up costing around $180,000 in total.<ref>{{cite news|last=Blistein|first=Jon|title=Louis C.K. to Release 1998 Film With Steve Carell, Amy Poehler|url=http://www.rollingstone.com/movies/news/louis-c-k-to-release-1998-film-with-steve-carell-amy-poehler-20140109|accessdate=February 2, 2014|newspaper=[[Rolling Stone]]|date=January 9, 2014}}</ref>

==Reception==
Dennis Harvey of ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' gave the film a mixed review, writing, "It takes the viewer awhile to settle into pic<U+2019>s endearing, off-kilter rhythms, and some of the material here... is uninspired. But for the most part ''Tomorrow Night'' grows steadily more hilarious as absurd situations are played out in a deliberately paced deadpan."<ref>{{cite news|last=Harvey|first=Dennis|title=Review: <U+2018>Tomorrow Night<U+2019>|url=http://variety.com/1998/film/reviews/tomorrow-night-1200452984/|accessdate=January 29, 2014|publisher=[[Variety (magazine){{!}}Variety]]|date=February 1, 1998}}</ref>  At South by Southwest, Sarah Hepola writes that the film's characters "weave a most enjoyable jaunt into an off-kilter universe, so wild and nonsensical, so bittersweet and beautiful that it might just be our own."<ref name=sxsw/>  Writing from the Hamptons International Film Festival, David Schwartz writes, "''Tomorrow Night'' is directed with surprising elegance and understatement. Moody black-and-white cinematography and touching yet eccentric performances add up to a potential cult favorite."<ref name=HIFF/>

Writing in 2014 after its online re-release, [[Neil Genzlinger]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' gave the film a negative review, writing, "It<U+2019>s clunky and sluggish and only intermittently funny, even given that it may be deliberately aiming for those qualities. It<U+2019>s not smart enough to be the kind of deadpan darling that it<U+2019>s trying to be."<ref>{{cite news|last=Genzlinger|first=Neil|title=Loving Ice Cream and an Older Woman|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/30/movies/louis-c-k-releases-his-tomorrow-night-from-1998.html|accessdate=January 29, 2014|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=January 29, 2014}}</ref>
