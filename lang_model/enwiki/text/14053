'''Plymouth Sound, Shores and Cliffs''' is a [[Site of Special Scientific Interest]] (SSSI) around the [[Plymouth Sound]], a large area of water where the [[River Plym]] and [[River Tamar|Tamar]] meet. It stretches across the two ceremonial counties of [[Devon]] and [[Cornwall]] and the unitary authority area of [[Plymouth]]. It contains fossils of plants and sea creatures and its cliffs show a timeline of the Middle to Early [[Devonian]] period hundreds of millions of years ago.

Lower to early Middle [[Devonian]] units of rock are visible from sections through the coastal cliffs and [[intertidal zone]]s, which were laid down 417 - 354 million years ago.<ref name="devon">{{cite web|url=http://www.devon.gov.uk/index/environment/natural_environment/geology/southerndevon.htm#11|title=Geology to see in Southern Devon|publisher=[[Devon]] County Council|accessdate=2008-11-27}}</ref> There are fossil remains of [[coral]]s, [[brachiopod]]s, [[bryozoa]], [[gastropod]]s, rare [[ornthoconic nautiloid]]s, [[ostrocod]]s, [[trilobite]]s, [[phacopid]]s), [[crinoids]]s, [[ostracoderm]] and [[acanthodian]] fish.<ref name="en">{{cite web|url=http://www.english-nature.org.uk/citation/citation_photo/2000130.pdf|format=pdf|title=Plymouth Sound Shores and Cliffs|work=english-nature.org|accessdate=2008-11-27}}</ref>

Jennycliff Bay has  steeply inclined folds, which flexure into open recumbent
folds <U+2014> some with [[wiktionary:chevron|chevron]] form. The folds have developed [[cleavage (geology)|cleavage]] in the [[slate]] and in the [[siltstone]]s and [[sandstone]]s, although it is more widely spaced throughout the silt and sandstones. To the south, the cleavage dips at moderate low angles and the [[stratum|strata]], which become overturned in places]], dips steeply. The original direction of the strata can be established using the graded and cross-bedding of sedimentary structures. It demonstrates that the section is situated on the overturned, steep or northern limb of the Dartmouth Antiform, which can be traced from [[Newquay]] to [[Dartmouth]].<ref name="en"/> This is evidence a period of tectonic plate collision between 330 and 300 million years ago, which exerted pressure on the rock.<ref name="devon"/> Folds of three generations with cleavages are visible through the section in Bovisand Bay. Generally, the first generation folds have gently southern dipping limbs which are overturned or steep. The cleavage consistently dips about 40 degrees south. This indicates that this section has the Dartmouth Antiform passing through it.<ref name="en"/> The far south consists of red and green slates with sandstones that were deposited in rivers and lakes.<ref name="devon"/>

On the western flank ([[Cornwall]]), there are harder rocks such as Staddon [[Grit]], which form a headland from Staddon Point. There is also deposits of sandstones in the shape of marine sand bars. Along most of the coast dramatic faults and folds in the rocks are vissible and, in some places, a chevron pattern is vissible.<ref name="devon"/>
