'''State Route&nbsp;140''' (SR&nbsp;140) was a [[State highways in Washington|state highway]] located in [[Clark County, Washington|Clark]] and [[Skamania County, Washington|Skamania]] counties in southwestern [[Washington (state)|Washington]]. The highway began and ended at {{nowrap|[[Washington State Route 14|SR 14]]}} in [[Washougal, Washington|Washougal]] and [[Prindle, Washington|Prindle]], respectively, and followed the [[Washougal River]] and Canyon Creek. The roadway first appeared as Canyon Creek Road in a 1911 map and was designated '''Secondary State Highway&nbsp;8B''' (SSH&nbsp;8B) in 1937. SSH&nbsp;8B was a [[spur route]] of {{nowrap|[[Primary State Highway 8 (Washington)|Primary State Highway 8]]}} (PSH&nbsp;8), which became {{nowrap|[[Washington State Route 12 (1964-1967)|SR 12]]}} in the [[1964 state highway renumbering (Washington)|1964 highway renumbering]]. SR&nbsp;120 replaced SSH&nbsp;8B in the same renumbering and SR&nbsp;12 was renumbered in 1967 to SR&nbsp;14 after {{nowrap|[[U.S. Route 12 in Washington|U.S. Route 12]]}} was extended into Washington. SR&nbsp;120 was also renumbered to SR&nbsp;140, which was decommissioned in 1992.

==Route description==

State Route&nbsp;140 (SR&nbsp;140) originated as 15th Street at an intersection with {{nowrap|[[Washington State Route 14|SR 14]]}} in [[Washougal, Washington|Washougal]], located about {{convert|1.47|mi|km|2}} east of the eastern terminus of {{nowrap|[[Washington State Route 500|SR 500]]}} on the shoreline of the [[Columbia River]].<ref name="log">{{cite web |url=http://www.wsdot.wa.gov/mapsdata/tdo/PDF_and_ZIP_Files/HwyLog2008.pdf |title=2008 State Highway Log |year=2008 |author=Washington State Department of Transportation |accessdate=28 September 2009}}</ref> 15th Street traveled north through Downtown, crossing the [[Vancouver, Washington|Vancouver]]&ndash;[[White Salmon, Washington|White Salmon]] rail route of the [[BNSF Railway]] and intersecting the former alignment of SR&nbsp;14, E Street,<ref name="map1967">{{cite map |publisher=[[University of Texas at Austin]] |cartography=[[United States Geological Survey]] |title=Vancouver, 1967 |year=1967 |url=http://www.lib.utexas.edu/maps/topo/250k/txu-pclmaps-topo-us-vancouver-1967.jpg |scale=1:250,000 |accessdate=28 September 2009}}</ref> before turning northeastward onto 17th Street.<ref name="rail">{{cite map |publisher=Washington State Department of Transportation |title=Washington State Railroad System |year=2008 |url=http://www.wsdot.wa.gov/NR/rdonlyres/1DFCBFA0-1A9D-4838-A74F-7841BF22E9C3/0/Railmap_update_Sept2008.pdf |accessdate=28 September 2009}}</ref> The highway crossed the [[Washougal River]] out of Washougal in a large forest and became the Washougal River Road. The roadway paralleled the river northeast and later east into the forests and mountains of [[Skamania County, Washington|Skamania County]] until the river turned north. SR&nbsp;140, renamed Canyon Creek Road, turned southeast and encountered a series of sharp turns until terminating at SR&nbsp;14 in [[Prindle, Washington|Prindle]].<ref name="map">{{google maps |url=http://maps.google.com/maps?f=d&source=s_d&saddr=State+Rd+14%2FWA-14&daddr=45.621962,-122.271309+to:SE+Evergreen+Blvd%2FWA-14&hl=en&geocode=FaJxtwIdGP60-A%3B%3BFQ-htwId1be3-A&mra=dpe&mrcr=0&mrsp=1&sz=12&via=1&sll=45.574125,-122.26689&sspn=0.168465,0.307961&ie=UTF8&z=12 |title=State Route 140 |accessdate=28 September 2009}}</ref>
