The '''Shanghai Metro''' (<U+4E0A><U+6D77><U+8F68><U+9053><U+4EA4><U+901A>) is an urban [[rapid transit]] system that serves the city of [[Shanghai]] by transporting around 1.8 million passengers each day. The system incorporates both subways (<U+5730><U+94C1>) and elevated light railways (<U+8F7B><U+8F68>). As new metro lines are opened, passenger volumes are expected to rise significantly. It is the third city in [[China]] to build a subway system after [[Beijing]] and [[Tianjin]] and as of 2006 operates more lines than any other subway system in [[mainland China]]. One of the world's newest, most rapidly expanding subway systems, the Shanghai Metro operates five lines, and has four more lines under construction&nbsp;&ndash; including extensions to the lines currently in operation.  

==Lines==
[[image:Shanghai metro map en.png|thumb|right|450px|Shanghai Metro Lines.]]

*'''[[Shanghai Metro Line 1|Line 1]]''', 32.358 km long, runs from [[Xinzhuang (Shanghai Metro)|Xinzhuang]] via [[Shanghai Railway Station]] to [[Gongfu Xincun]].
*'''[[Shanghai Metro Line 2|Line 2]]''', 25.4 km long, runs from [[Songhong Road (Shanghai Metro)|Songhong Road]] to [[Zhangjiang (Shanghai Metro)|Zhangjiang]].
*'''[[Shanghai Metro Line 3|Line 3]]''', 40.3 km long, runs from [[North Jiangyang Road (Shanghai Metro)|North Jiangyang Road]] to [[Shanghai South Railway Station (Shanghai Metro)|Shanghai South Railway Station]].
*'''[[Shanghai Metro Line 4|Line 4]]''', 27 km long, overlaps with Line 3 on about half of its run.  The non-overlapping Line 4 section opened in January 2006, and when the remaining section opens in in late 2007, it will form a complete circular line.
*'''[[Shanghai Metro Line 5|Line 5]]''', 17.2 km long, runs from [[Xinzhuang (Shanghai Metro)|Xinzhuang]] to the [[Minhang]] Development Zone.

===Interchange===

The following are interchange stations:

*[[Xinzhuang (Shanghai Metro)|Xinzhuang]] between '''[[Shanghai Metro Line 1|Line 1]]''' and '''[[Shanghai Metro Line 5|Line 5]]'''
*[[Shanghai South Railway Station (Shanghai Metro)|Shanghai South Railway Station]] between '''[[Shanghai Metro Line 1|Line 1]]''' and '''[[Shanghai Metro Line 3|Line 3]]'''
*[[Shanghai Indoor Stadium (Shanghai Metro)|Shanghai Indoor Stadium]] between '''[[Shanghai Metro Line 1|Line 1]]''' and '''[[Shanghai Metro Line 4|Line 4]]'''
*[[People's Square (Shanghai Metro)|People's Square]] between '''[[Shanghai Metro Line 1|Line 1]]''' and '''[[Shanghai Metro Line 2|Line 2]]'''
*[[Zhongshan Park (Shanghai Metro)|Zhongshan Park]] between '''[[Shanghai Metro Line 2|Line 2]]''', '''[[Shanghai Metro Line 3|Line 3]]''' and '''[[Shanghai Metro Line 4|Line 4]]'''
*Hongqiao Road, Yan'an Road (West), Jinshajiang Road, Zhenping Road, Zhongtan Road, Shanghai Railway Station and Baoshan Road are shared between '''[[Shanghai Metro Line 3|Line 3]]''' and '''[[Shanghai Metro Line 4|Line 4]]'''
*[[Shiji Avenue (Shanghai Metro)|Shiji Avenue]] (formerly Dongfang Road) between '''[[Shanghai Metro Line 2|Line 2]]''' and '''[[Shanghai Metro Line 4|Line 4]]''' 

Though Yishan Road of Line 3 and Line 4 share a name, they are not one stop and interchanging is not yet possible.

To transfer between Shanghai Railway Station Line 1 station and Line 3/4 station requires exiting and re-entering the pay area.

==Ticket system==
<!--{{Shanghai Metro Price Table|1}}
{{Shanghai Metro Price Table|2}}
{{Shanghai Metro Price Table|3}}
{{Shanghai Metro Price Table|4}}
{{Shanghai Metro Price Table|5}}-->
Like many metro systems in the world, the fares on the Shanghai Subway are distance based. As of September 15, 2005, when the Shanghai government raised them, fares ranged from 3 yuan (approx USD $0.375) for journeys under 6km, to 8 yuan for journeys over 46km. 

As of December 25, 2005, Shanghai uses a "one ticket network", which means free interchange between all lines without purchase of another ticket. However, as of May 2007, you will still need two tickets to interchange between between lines 1 and 3 in Shanghai Railway Station.

===Fares===
(1) For most lines, the base fare is 3 [[Chinese yuan|yuan]] for journeys under 6km, then 1 yuan for each additional 10 km.  Since the longest possible journey is 50 km long, the highest fare is 8 yuan.

(2) For journeys exclusively on [[Shanghai Metro Line 5|Line 5]] (From Xinzhuang To Minhang Development Zone), the fare is 2 yuan for journeys under 6 km and all other journeys are 3 yuan (the total length of this line being 16 km).

(3) There will be a 10% discount for the rest of the calendar month if you use [[Shanghai Public Transportation Card]] and your fare reaches 70 yuan in a month.

===Single tickets===
Single journey tickets can be purchased from ticket vending machines or at a ticket window. The new stations on [[Shanghai Metro Line 4|Line 4]] only use ticket vending machines. Ticket vending machines accepts coins and notes/bills.

===Transit Card===
[[Image:Shanghai Metro station 5.jpg|thumb|250px|Passengers exit via the [[turnstile]]s.]]
{{main|Shanghai Public Transportation Card}}
Apart from the single ticket, payment for the journey can be made by buying a [[Shanghai Public Transportation Card]]. This contactless card can be bought for a refundable fee of 30 yuan at convenience stores and metro stations. There are also special edition cards for a non-refundable 20 yuan. Only some stations can refund the card fee ([[Jiangsu Lu|Jiangsu Road]] on [[Shanghai Metro Line 2|Line 2]] for example). This card can be recharged at ticket booths situated at the metro stations as well as many small convenience shops throughout the city. The Shanghai Public Transportation Card can also be used to pay for other forms of transportation, such as taxi or bus.

This transit card is similar to the [[Chicago card]] of the [[Chicago Transit Authority|CTA]], the [[SmarTrip]] of the [[Washington Metro]], and the [[Octopus card]] of [[Hong Kong]]'s [[MTR]] .

==Stations of note==
[[Image:Shanghai Metro platform.jpg|thumb|250px|A platform of a station]]
[[Image:Shanghai Light Rail Transit.jpg|thumb|250px|Shanghai light rail transit station]]
The busiest station in the Shanghai metro system is [[People's Square (Shanghai Metro)|People's Square station]] ('''[[Shanghai Metro Line 1|Line 1]]''','''[[Shanghai Metro Line 2|Line 2]]'''). As the transfer station for the north-south '''[[Shanghai Metro Line 1|Line 1]]''' and the east-west '''[[Shanghai Metro Line 2|Line 2]]''', it is extremely crowded during peak hours. It remains busy during the rest of the day, as it is located near major shopping and tourist destinations such as  [[Nanjing Road]] (E.) Pedestrian Street as well as the Shanghai Museum, People's Park, the [[Shanghai Grand Theatre]] and Yan'an Park on [[People's Square]].

[[Xujiahui (Shanghai Metro)|Xujiahui station]] ('''[[Shanghai Metro Line 1|Line 1]]''') is located in the major [[Xujiahui]] commercial center of Shanghai. Six large [[shopping mall]]s and eight large office towers are each within a three-minute walk of one of the station's fourteen exits, the largest number of exits of any Shanghai Subway station.

[[Lujiazui (Shanghai Metro)|Lujiazui station]] ('''[[Shanghai Metro Line 2|Line 2]]''') is the major stop in Pudong area. It is situated in the heart of Lujiazui financial district, the developing financial center of Shanghai. The city's new symbol, the [[Oriental Pearl TV Tower]], is within walking distance of the station, as is the [[Jin Mao Tower]], the tallest building in mainland China. Compared to Xujiahui and People's Square, Lujiazui is not particularly busy during off-peak hours or at weekends as it is used primarily by those who commute to the district for work.

[[Shanghai Railway Station (Shanghai Metro)|Shanghai Railway Station]] ('''[[Shanghai Metro Line 1|Line 1]]''','''[[Shanghai Metro Line 3|Line 3]]''' and '''[[Shanghai Metro Line 4|Line 4]]''') is a major transportation hub in Shanghai, containing the railway station, two subway lines and the stop for many city bus lines as well as interprovincial buses. These bus lines will soon be housed in a brand new bus station currently under construction behind the train station.

[[Zhongshan Park (Shanghai Metro)|Zhongshan Park station]] ('''[[Shanghai Metro Line 2|Line 2]]''','''[[Shanghai Metro Line 3|Line 3]]''' and '''[[Shanghai Metro Line 4|Line 4]]'''): The most line interchanged station.

[[Shiji Avenue (Shanghai Metro)|Shiji Avenue station]] ('''[[Shanghai Metro Line 2|Line 2]]''' and '''[[Shanghai Metro Line 4|Line 4]]'''): The largest interchange station.

==Retail==
[[Image:Shanghai Metro station 3.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Passengers in a station]]
Nearly every Shanghai subway station houses [[retail]]ing of some kind. Many are small kiosks selling a variety of [[telephony]] products such as telephone calling cards, [[mobile phone]] [[SIM]] cards, or new [[telephone]]s. There are also newsstands, with some stations having as many as three competing vendors. Snack shops have become popular, along with bookstores.

==Criticism==
The system is marred by aggressive passengers who exacerbate the already crowded rush hour conditions. To deal with congestion and passenger safety, glass screens, which open when the train arrives, are being fitted to platforms. 

Transfers are inconvenient compared to urban transport systems elsewhere. For example, stations that share the same name on different lines are often hundreds of meters apart. Transferring between different lines frequently requires walking through numerous tunnels.

In many stations, the retail section would appear to dominate the station concourse. The [[Xujiahui]] station houses three restaurants, a sushi establishment, a salon, a shoe store, a bookstore, a teahouse, an art dealer, more than twenty trinket shops no larger than 2 m<U+00B2> each and a 500 meter long underground shopping arcade with dozens of stores, mostly selling women's and girls' clothing and shoes. The result can be disorientating for casual visitors attempting to access the platforms. The only other stations with such a shopping selection are Shanghai Railway station (in the transfer corridor) and the Milan Plaza arcade in Zhongshan Park station.

The Metro operators have responded to some criticism. For example, in the People's Square station, the transfer corridor between two lines has been stripped of retail space and shortened to deal with congestion and reduce the hassle of commuters.

==Technology==
[[Image:Shanghai Metro inside train.jpg|thumb|250px|Inside a train]]
In contrast to many other metro systems in the world, the Shanghai metro uses [[overhead lines|overhead wires]] for the power supply, probably due to its use of a 1500 volt system which is twice the voltage generally used for [[third rail]]s. Standard gauge is used throughout the network, allowing new metro equipment to be transported over the Chinese rail network which uses the same gauge.

Plasma screens on the platforms show passengers when the next two trains are coming (usually one every five minutes or less), along with advertisements and public service announcements. The subway cars contain [[Liquid crystal display|LCD]] screens showing advertisements and on some lines, the next stop, while above-ground trains have [[light-emitting diode|LED]] screens showing the next stop. There are recorded messages stating the next stop in Mandarin and English, but the messages stating nearby attractions/shops for a given stop (a form of paid advertising) are in Mandarin only. 

Accessibility facilities for the disabled are available at all stations. Sliding [[acrylic glass]] safety doors exist on platforms on the newest Line 4. These open as the train approaches and remain closed at other times. These screens are also being retrofitted on existing lines, starting with Line 1 whose core stations had doors by the end of 2006.

Cars used by the Metro system:

* 60 [[Bombardier]] Movia 456 6 car sets - Line 1 and 5
* 37 [[German Shanghai Metro Group]] (GSMG) 6 cars units - Line 1 and 2
* 28 [[Alstom]] Megapolis six-car sets - Line 3
* 168 [[Alstom Metropolis Cars|Alstom Metropolis]] (six car sets)
* 152 [[Alstom Metropolis Cars|Alstom Metropolis]] (six car set)

==Operators==
Two companies operate the Shanghai Metro network.
* '''Shanghai Metro Operation Co., Ltd.''' manages [[Shanghai Metro Line 1|Line 1]], [[Shanghai Metro Line 2|Line 2]], [[Shanghai Metro Line 3|Line 3]] and [[Shanghai Metro Line 4|Line 4]].
* '''Shanghai Modern Rail Transit Co., Ltd.''' manages [[Shanghai Metro Line 5|Line 5]].

==Future==
Several lines are either under construction or planned to be constructed in the near or distant future. After the completion of these lines, a uniform numbering system will be put in place.

===Under construction===
