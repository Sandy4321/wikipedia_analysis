It was first published in 1830. The book is separated into two parts; the first being a  critique of religion, and the second a philosophical debate.

==Production==

The book was reported to Paris police sometime between 1946 and 1947, at a time when Diderot was already under police surveillance. When the book was completed in 1947, Diderot was unable to find a publisher, and the sole copy of the book remained at his home until it was confiscated during a police search in 1752. The book was reportedly lost in police custody, and remained unheard of until it was put up for auction by a Paris bookseller in 1800. The books surfacing led to legal dispute between Diderot's daughter and the bookseller over rightful ownership. The dispute caused the book to be confiscated by Police for the second time.<ref name=israel/> It remained unpublished until 1830.

==Content==

The book is said to reveal the intellectual development of Diderot during the time it was written, and is considered to be the turning point in Diderot's transition to [[atheism]].<ref name=israel>{{cite book |last=Israel |first=Jonathon |authorlink=Jonathan Israel |title=Enlightenment Contested: Philosophy, Modernity, and the Emancipation of Man 1670-1752 |url=http://books.google.com.au/books?id=7qAeKpIIxCsC&pg=PA790&dq=La+Promenade+du+sceptique&hl=en&sa=X&ei=vPQZUtqIF8m0iQee4YDIDw&ved=0CFoQ6AEwBw#v=onepage&q=La%20Promenade%20du%20sceptique&f=false |accessdate=August 25, 2013 |year=2009 |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |location= |isbn=978-0199541522 |page=790-791}}</ref> The book questions the integrity of both the bible and the [[God in Abrahamic religions|Abrahamic god]]. Part of the book presents a fictional story, set shortly after the [[Battle of Fontenoy]], involving a small group of philosophers.<ref name=israel/> Themes include choosing between carnal pleasures and 'higher' morals. The narrator of the story meets "one of those blondes whom a philosopher ought to avoid", who convinces him that it is better to embrace happiness on earth than to wait for it in heaven.<ref>{{cite book |last=Perry |first=Gill |authorlink= |title=Femininity and Masculinity in Eighteenth-Century Art and Culture |url=http://books.google.com.au/books?id=HciUKoMSzjoC&pg=PA162&dq=La+Promenade+du+sceptique&hl=en&sa=X&ei=r_8ZUvuDM4utiQexnoFY&ved=0CFAQ6AEwBjgU#v=onepage&q=La%20Promenade%20du%20sceptique&f=false |accessdate=August 25, 2013 |year=1994 |publisher= |location= |isbn=978-0719042287 |page=162}}</ref> Philosophical debate in the book is said to show Diderot's distinct withdraw from the [[Age of Enlightenment]].<ref name=israel/>

The book has been described as being highly satirical, and Diderot's "most unkind treatment of [[Judaism]] and the ancient Jews."<ref name=leon/>
