'''[[Tamils]]''' living in [[R<U+00E9>union]], the French island in the [[Indian Ocean]] are settled in this relatively isolated Island since the second part of the last century, Tamils have developed some patterns of behavior that are not quite those of their ancestors from Tamil Nadu nor those of the other inhabitants of La R<U+00E9>union. Originally brought in as indentured laborers to [[R<U+00E9>union]], they were mostly from [[South Indian]] [[Tamil people|Tamil]]s and [[Telugu people|Telugu]]s<ref>www.indiandiaspora.nic.in</ref>.

==History==
Indian workers came to R<U+00E9>union from South India, mostly from French settlements in [[Tamil Nadu]], [[Pondichery]], [[Karikal]] and also from parts of [[Jaffna]]. Tamils mistakenly identified as ''[[Malabars]]'' by Westerners to designate all the people of South India (Tamils included). This term, accordingly applied by the French to Tamil laborers coming to La R<U+00E9>union, has been kept by the latter to label their own identity as well. The vast majority of the Tamil immigrants were from a variety of different castes. Hard living conditions at home were the main reason behind their departure to La R<U+00E9>union. The immigration of [[indentured workers]] from South India started actually in 1827 but it was only after 1848 that a real indentured immigration began on a big scale.<ref>GHASARIAN Christian. 1990.
