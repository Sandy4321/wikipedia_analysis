The 117th [[The Boat Race|Boat Race]] took place on 27 March 1971. Held annually, it is a [[Rowing (sport)#Side by side|side-by-side rowing]] race between crews from the Universities of [[University of Oxford|Oxford]] and [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]] along the [[River Thames]].  It was won by Cambridge who passed the finishing post ten lengths ahead of Oxford, securing Cambridge's fourth consecutive victory.  The winning time was, at that point, the second fastest in the history of the event.

In the reserve race, [[Goldie (Cambridge University Boat Club)|Goldie]] beat Isis, and in the [[Women's Boat Race]], Cambridge were victorious.
