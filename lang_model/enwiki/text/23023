Wierson is the Executive Producer of the feature documentary film "[[Back Door Channels: The Price of Peace]]", which held its world premiere in [[Abu Dhabi]] at the 2010 Abu Dhabi Film Festival,<ref>http://ticketing.abudhabifilmfestival.ae/eng/film.aspx?ID=2148</ref> formerly known as the [[Middle East International Film Festival]]. After an early cut screening of the film in 2009,<ref>http://www.festivaltvmontecarlo.spoilersfrance.com/home.php?page=news1</ref> it was selected by H.S.H. [[Albert II, Prince of Monaco]] to open the 49th Annual Monte-Carlo Film & Television Festival at an invitation-only private royal screening. It has since been shown in over 40 Film Festivals and in 2012 aired nationally in the United States on [[PBS]].

Wierson led NYC TV to 160 Emmy nominations in his seven years at the helm of the network. He was nominated on 29 different occasions for the role of Executive Producer in the creation of various programs, and in 2007, he won five Emmy awards for his role as the Executive Producer of the nationally syndicated [[Secrets of New York]].<ref>[http://articles.latimes.com/2007/may/28/nation/na-secrets28 LA Times, <U+201C>City TV dons stilettos and vinyl<U+201D> A-16, 05-28-07]</ref><ref>[http://www.nyemmys.org/attachments/wysiwyg/4292/2008EmmyAwardWinnersPressReleaseAUG21.pdf 2008 NY NATAS Emmy Press Release]</ref><ref>[http://www.nyemmys.org/attachments/wysiwyg/4292/2009_Emmy_Award_Winners_Press_Release.pdf 2009 NY Natas Official Emmy Winners Press Release]</ref>

==Early years==
Wierson grew up in Excelsior, Minnesota and attended part of his high school years in the Middle East. He graduated from [[Minnetonka High School]] (1990), later graduating ''cum laude'' from [[Georgetown University]] (1994) with a Bachelor's of Science degree in Foreign Service.<ref>[http://dic.academic.ru/dic.nsf/enwiki/919582 List of Notable Georgetown University Alumni.]</ref> In 1997, Wierson, an International Rotary Scholar, received his Master<U+00B4>s Degree in Economics from the University of S<U+00E3>o Paulo at Campinas (UNICAMP)<ref>http://www.eco.unicamp.br/teses/mest_economia.html</ref>

==Banking career==
Wierson's career began as an investment banker, working for the [[World Bank]], [[ABN AMRO]] Bank, and [[J.P. Morgan & Co.|JP Morgan]].<ref>[http://www.mediabistro.com/articles/cache/a9587.asp Media Bistro Interviews NYC TV General Manager Arick Wierson]</ref> There has been ample speculation that Wierson was hired to lend his political and personal connections to the Dutch Banking giant [[ABN Amro]] to ensure a successful acquisition of the Brazilian retail giant [[Banco Real]].

==Public Sector==
In the 1990s, Wierson worked under former Brazilian Finance Minister Rubens Ric<U+00FA>pero and, later, former Nicaraguan President [[Violeta Chamorro]]. In 2001, billionaire businessman [[Michael Bloomberg]]<ref>http://digitalcontentproducer.com/mag/video_civil_service_television/</ref> made a personal appeal through his spouse, Fabiana Mesquita-Wierson, then the one ot he top executives in Bloomberg LP's operations in Latin America, to recruit her spouse to New York from Brazil to aid him in his 2001 mayoral campaign. During Bloomberg's initial 2001 election campaign, Wierson headed "Democrats for Bloomberg" initiatives and oversaw the campaign's field operations which combined traditional electioneering and voter profiling databases, which political analysts today say was the campaign that ushered in a new era technically sophisticated, statistical, voter profiling for political operation in the country.<ref>

Wierson has maintained close political ties in his home state of [[Minnesota]], reestablishing residency in the state in 2009. He is known to be close to maverick political strategist [[Bill Hillsman]], who has asked Wierson to lecture in his courses at the [[John F. Kennedy School of Government]] at [[Harvard University]] on several occasions.<ref>[http://books.google.com/books?id=eh1Vph-3j0AC&pg=PR13&lpg=PR13&dq=arick+wierson+bill+hillsman&source=bl&ots=R42Ux6IAq0&sig=1ZGdCdYzRr8KqHKONWP1Yos0rn0&hl=en&ei=PqWhSdzCEaGbtwfPtP2KDQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&resnum=4&ct=result <U+201C>Run the Other Way<U+201D> By Bill Hillsman (Simon and Schuster, 2002)]</ref> In June 2010, Brazilian Vice Presidential candidate and Federal Deputy [[Ant<U+00F4>nio Pedro de Siqueira Indio da Costa]] ([[Democratas (Brasil)]]) invited Wierson to advise him and Presidential candidate [[Jos<U+00E9> Serra]] on media and political matters during the final months of the campaign before the October election.<ref>http://www.portaldatelevisao.net/2010/08/e-os-candidatos-vice-voces-consideram.html</ref> Wierson is said to have declined the invitation due to "ongoing engagements in Angola."

==Media Interests==
[[Broadcasting & Cable]] Magazine described Wierson as "one of the most important people in New York media".<ref name="allbusiness2005"/> Under Wierson, NYC TV expanded from a local cable operation to a broad array of broadcast, cable, production, online video and syndication entities, organized under the name of [[NYC Media Group]].<ref>

 }}</ref> At his time at NYC TV, Wierson led the network to 42 Emmy Awards and over 100 National Telly Cable Awards. In addition to ''Secrets of New York'', Wierson played a role in the creation of many of the network's original series' productions including ''[[$9.99]]'', ''[[Eat Out NY]]'', ''[[New York 360*]]'', and ''[[The Bridge (2005 TV series)|The Bridge]]''. In 2008, Wierson led NYC TV's digital media group to its first-ever [[Webby Awards|Webby]] nominations.

At NYC Media Group (since rebranded as [[NYC Media]]), Wierson was vocal critic of the traditional public broadcasting model.<ref>[http://gothamist.com/2006/05/22/wnyc_tv_love_it.php Gothamist: <U+201C>NYC TV - Love It or Hate It<U+201D> 22 May 2006]</ref> In 2005, Wierson disbanded the station<U+2019>s long-held PBS status, enabling NYC TV's original shows to take over prime-time<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.nytimes.com/2006/05/22/nyregion/22nyctv.html?pagewanted=2&n=Top/Reference/Times%20Topics/People/B/Bloomberg,%20Michael%20R | work=The New York Times | title=One Television Station, and Countless Hours, Devoted to Pulse of New York Life | first=Winnie | last=Hu | date=2006-05-22 | accessdate=2010-04-25}}</ref> "It was smart not to be the 'fifth channel,' said Dalton Delan, executive vice president of WETA in Washington.

In August 2006, Wierson, Unger and Bloomberg appeared in the NBC studios, joined WNBC General Manager [[Francis Comerford]] and former NBC Station Group President Jay Ireland in announcing a partnership between NYC TV and NBC flagship station WNBC<ref>[http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117948489.html?categoryid=14&cs=1 Variety, "NYC TV shows to WNBC" Tue., Aug. 15, 2006, Addie Morfoot.]</ref> The executives were flanked by two of NYC TV's on-air stars, [[Kelly Choi]] and [[Amy Palmer]], who would be hosting some of the programming that would be part of the content deal, namely [[Eat Out NY]] and [[New York 360*]].

On April 28, 2009, Mayor Bloomberg announced Wierson was stepping down as CEO of NYC Media Group. The Mayor lauded Wierson's service to him stating, "Over the past seven years, Arick Wierson and his team transformed NYC TV into one of the nation<U+2019>s best television stations. After helping build the station virtually from scratch, Arick oversaw the merger of NYC TV with [[WNYE-TV]] and [[WNYE-FM]], creating the largest local media group in New York that now reaches hundreds of thousands of people every day. NYC TV<U+2019>s 160 New York Emmy nominations and 42 awards serve as a testament to Arick<U+2019>s vision, tenacity, and leadership and to the excellence of the media group he was instrumental in creating. I have no doubt that Arick<U+2019>s entrepreneurial and creative talents, which helped him achieve great things at NYC TV will serve him well as he rejoins the private sector..."<ref>[http://www.nyc.gov/portal/site/nycgov/menuitem.c0935b9a57bb4ef3daf2f1c701c789a0/index.jsp?pageID=mayor_press_release&catID=1194&doc_name=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.nyc.gov%2Fhtml%2Fom%2Fhtml%2F2009a%2Fpr187-09.html&cc=unused1978&rc=1194&ndi=1STATEMENT BY MAYOR MICHAEL R.

It was later revealed that Wierson had been planning an exit from NYC TV for well over a year. In a private email circulated among city officials, Wierson revealed that has had been planning to leave NYC TV since late 2008 to work on a number of projects in Brazil and Portuguese-speaking Africa, where Wierson had previously spent many years as an investment banker with ABN AMRO Bank. Additionally, the New York Times revealed that Wierson had been quietly producing a documentary film starring former U.S. President Jimmy Carter "[[Back Door Channels: The Price of Peace]]" which later opened in [[Monte-Carlo]] and [[Abu Dhabi]].<ref>The New York Times: http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/2009/04/28/nyregion/wierson-190.jpg&imgrefurl=http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/tag/news-media/&usg=__3QqAJQtSRVXz9UrLysZd9d5NyjA=&h=241&w=190&sz=13&hl=pt-BR&start=5&um=1&tbnid=7jR0GxiyYaziMM:&tbnh=110&tbnw=87&prev=/images%3Fq%3Darick%2Bwierson%26hl%3Dpt-BR%26client%3Dfirefox-a%26rls%3Dorg.mozilla:en-US:official%26hs%3D2gd%26sa%3DN%26um%3D1</ref>

==WNYE Radio New York 91.5FM==
In 2008, Wierson led an NYC Media Group overhaul of [[WNYE-FM]] 91.5FM, including new formats for morning and afternoon  drive-time programming. On February 19, 2008, WNYE announced that it was re-branding itself as "Radio New York" and that the station was partnering for live coast-to-coast music feeds with Seattle-based alternative rock station [[KEXP]].<ref>[http://jazzchill.blogspot.com/2008_02_01_archive.html KEXP COMING TO 91.5 FM IN NY]</ref> The announcement was seen as an overtly aggressive move by the New York City Indie music community, causing broadcaster [[WFUV]] to take public on-air swipes at Wierson for having encroached on their market.<ref>[http://www.timeout.com/newyork/articles/tv/27691/air-raid Air Raid: a new kid comes to town as Seattle<U+2019>s indie-loving KEXP moves onto city-controlled airwaves]</ref> On March 5, 2009,  Wierson, along with NYC Mayor Michael Bloomberg, announced that WNYE, after being in Brooklyn since 1938, was moving its radio broadcast operations to Manhattan, and was unveiling a new digital transmitter, capable of transmitting multiple in-band [[HD radio]] streams.<ref>[http://www.govtech.com/gt/articles/625383 New York City Upgrades Radio Transmitter, Government Technology News]</ref>

==The Politics of NYC Media Group==
Although his success with NYC TV is well documented, Wierson, like his boss [[Michael Bloomberg]], has been criticized for his was known for his aggressive management style, risk-taking, and disregard for formalities. His close personal ties to Bloomberg extends to his spouse, Fabiana Mesquita-Wierson, was one of the top executives at Bloomberg, LP; based in Brazil, she had been the executive responsible for expanding Bloomberg's operations throughout Latin America. In fact, it is rumored that Bloomberg named Wierson's daughter, Isabella, takes her first name because Bloomberg suggested to Wierson and his wife that they call her "Izzie" while Mesquita-Wierson was still pregnant.<ref>Bloomberg Engages in Casual Reparte with Fabiana Mesquita-Wierson, Wife of Arick Wierson, Bloomie's Media Boss, at NYC-TV event in Manhattan http://www.veoh.com/browse/videos/category/entertainment/watch/v6395248WhxSbRHz</ref>

The relationship between the Wiersons and Bloomberg was similar that of NYC TV co-founder [[Seth Unger]], who's wife, Allison Jaffin, works at City Hall and the [[Bloomberg Family Foundation]] through a special waiver granted by the city's ethics board.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.nydailynews.com/news/2007/12/23/2007-12-23_mayor_bloombergs_aides_staff_his_foundat.html | location=New York | work=Daily News | title=Mayor Bloomberg's aides staff his foundation without city ethics check | date=2007-12-23}}</ref> Critics have voiced concerns that Wierson and Unger, both long-time members of Bloomberg's circle of trusted aides and loyalists, pushed the television channels and radio stations to further Mayor Bloomberg's political agenda with programs such as [[City Scoop]]<ref>[http://www.ci.nyc.ny.us/portal/site/nycgov/menuitem.c0935b9a57bb4ef3daf2f1c701c789a0/index.jsp?pageID=mayor_press_release&catID=1194&doc_name=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ci.nyc.ny.us%2Fhtml%2Fom%2Fhtml%2F2008a%2Fpr141-08.html&cc=unused1978&rc=1194&ndi=1 MAYOR BLOOMBERG ANNOUNCES LAUNCH OF NYC TV'S CITY SCOOP, A WEEKLY NEWS MAGAZINE PROGRAM HIGHLIGHTING CITY GOVERNMENT NEWS AND EVENTS, PR- 141-08, April 18, 2008]</ref> - winner of a NY Emmy in 2009.<ref>[http://www.nyemmys.org/attachments/wysiwyg/4292/2009_NY_Emmy_Nominees_Mar_3.pdf NY Natas 2009 Emmy Nominations Press Release]</ref> The central contention has been that NYC TV was simply a very slick and well-oiled sales machine. In a 2006 article on the network, the NY Times' Winnie Hu wrote, "NYC TV is largely an invention of the Bloomberg administration, which has aggressively attempted to apply the latest technology and business practices from the private sector to all levels of city government. Mayor Michael Bloomberg, who began Bloomberg Television as part of his media empire, knew better than most the value of a city television station, his aides said."<ref>[http://www.nytimes.com/2006/05/22/nyregion/22nyctv.html?_r=1&pagewanted=1&n=Top/Reference/Times%20Topics/People/B/Bloomberg,%20Michael%20R. NY Times, W. Hu, May 22, 2006]</ref>

==Controversies and Criticisms==
Over the years Wierson was at the helm of New York City's media assets, he frequently, and sometimes very publicly, sparred with public officials who had a bone to pick with Mayor Bloomberg. One elected official who was a consistent thorn in Wierson's side was New York City Councilwoman [[Gale Brewer]]. Brewer, who represents Manhattan's [[Upper West Side]] regularly criticized NYC TV for being <U+201C>too flashy<U+201D> with its focus on fashion, celebrity, and other topics she viewed as inconsistent with the mission of the network.<ref>

In August 2009, the [[Village Voice]], dedicated a cover story to the rise of NYC TV, focusing on the organization's president and co-founder, Arick Wierson. The author, Tom Robbins, a vocal critic of Mayor Bloomberg (who has taken to calling Bloomberg "Mayor Mugabe"<ref>http://www.villagevoice.com/2008-10-22/columns/michael-bloomberg-s-velvet-coup/</ref> in drawing comparisons between him and the Zimbabwean dictator [[Robert Mugabe]]) wrote about Wierson's business interests outside of government.<ref>http://www.villagevoice.com/2009-08-04/news/inside-the-mayor-s-studio-nyc-tv-and-the-secrets-of-new-york</ref> Robbins has since been let go of the Village Voice.<ref>Village Voice Fires Wayne Barrett, Tom Robbins http://www.mediabistro.com/fishbowlny/tom-robbins-comments-on-leaving-the-village-voice_b24868?c=rss</ref>

The Village Voice, under financial pressure,<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/31/business/media/31voice.html?_r=2&partner=rss&emc=rss | work=The New York Times | title=Village Voice Lays Off Nat Hentoff and 2 Others | first=Stephanie | last=Clifford | date=2008-12-31}}</ref> has taken an unabated anti-Bloomberg stance, hoping to appeal to New Yorkers upset with the Mayor's overturning of term-limits, and so it appears that the real target of the Robbin's 8 articles on NYC TV was Bloomberg. Robbins portrayed Wierson and the media assets he had been quietly amassing since Bloomberg took office, as part of a concerted effort to use a hazy mixture of campaign, personal, not-for-profit and public sector resources at the Mayor's disposal to manipulate his public image,<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/2009/11/28/2009-11-28_mayor_bloomberg_spends_102m_to_win_third_term__or_175_per_vote_.html | location=New York | work=Daily News | title=Mayor Bloomberg spent $102M on campaign to win third term - or $175 per vote | first=Celeste | last=Katz | date=2009-11-28}}</ref> positioning him for first a presidential run,<ref>http://www.villagevoice.com/2010-05-04/columns/nyc-life-bloomberg-business-trips/</ref> then later a third-term as Mayor. Robbin's initial article described Wierson as a Bloomberg insider who was given ''carte-blanche'' to run the city agency as he saw fit, often eschewing traditional public-service protocols.

In a Fall 2009 Village Voice cover story, Robbins profiled Wierson and his close relationship with not only Bloomberg but other wealthy businessmen, royalty, and politicians, describing Wierson as "a tall man with a broad jaw, who wears his hair fashionably slicked back" and his wife, [[Fabiana Wierson]], as "an attractive blond from Brazil." The author was critical of Wierson's close business ties to New York billionaire and real estate tycoon [[Leon Charney]], as well as Wierson's relationship with Monaco's [[Prince Albert II]]. Robbins found the small fine that Wierson paid to the City's Conflicts Board to settle the issue as the "...latest episode of justice in the Bloomberg era."<ref>http://blogs.villagevoice.com/runninscared/archives/2010/01/bloombergs_nyc-.php</ref>

==Academia==
Wierson is an adjunct professor of business at the [[MBA]] program at Metropolitan College of New York (formerly known as [[Audrey Cohen College]]) lecturing on the business of media and television.

Due to a special request from the [[Monte-Carlo Television Festival]] in Monaco, an early cut of the movie was shown in [[Monaco]] in 2009 to a private audience including Prince Albert. In June 2011, Fisher Klingenstein Films announced that it had acquired worldwide rights to "Back Door Channels: The Price of Peace" and laid out plans for a platform release in New York City on Sept. 16, 2011, followed by openings in Los Angeles, San Francisco, Chicago, Cleveland, Boston and Philadelphia.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1118038863?refCatId=13&query=Back+door+channels | work=Variety | first=Dave | last=McNary | title='Peace' doc roll out set | date=2011-06-21}}</ref> The film deals with the 1979 Peace Treaty between Israel and Egypt and the unlikely circumstances and behind-the scenes jockeying that led to its coming to fruition.<ref>http://www.4rfv.co.uk/industrynews.asp?id=90091</ref> The film features former U.S. President [[Jimmy Carter]], former Secretary-General of the U.N.
