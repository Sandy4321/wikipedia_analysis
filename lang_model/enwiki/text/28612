The question of the '''origins of baseball''' has been the subject of debate and controversy for more than a century. [[Baseball]] (and [[softball]]), as well as the other modern bat, ball and running games, [[cricket]] and [[rounders]], developed from earlier folk games. 

Although the roots of baseball are [[England|English]], similar games have also been played in other parts of the world. [[Oina]] is a [[Romania|Romanian]] ball sport, similar in some ways to baseball. [[Russia]] had a bat and ball game called [[Lapta (game)|Lapta]] since the 14th century. Germans played a game called Schlagball, which was similar to rounders. A "bowler" threw a ball to a "striker," who hit it with a club and then tried to run around a circuit of bases without getting hit with the ball by a defender.

Americans played a version of the English game rounders in the early 1800s which they called "Town Ball". In fact, early forms of baseball had a number of names, including "Base Ball", "Goal Ball", "Round Ball", "Fletch-catch", "stool ball", and simply "Base". In at least one version of the game, teams pitched to themselves, runners went around the bases in the opposite direction of today's game, and players could be put out by being hit with the ball like in Schlagball. Like today, however, it was three strikes and you're out.
 
Few details of how the modern games developed from earlier folk games are known. Some think that various folk games resulted in a game called [[town ball]], from which baseball was eventually born. Others believe that town ball was independent from baseball.The origins of baseball might never be fully discovered.

==Folk games in England==
A number of early folk games in [[England]] had characteristics that can be seen in modern [[baseball]] (as well as in [[cricket]] and [[rounders]]). Many of these early games involved a ball that was thrown at a target while an opposing player defended the target by attempting to hit the ball away. If the batter successfully hit the ball, he could attempt to score points by running between bases while fielders would attempt to catch or retrieve the ball and put the runner out in some way.

Since they were folk games, the early games had no 'official' rules, and they tended to change over time. To the extent that there were rules, they were generally simple and were not written down. There were many local variations, and varied names.

Many of the early games were not well documented, first, because they were generally peasant games (and perhaps children's games, as well); and second, because they were often discouraged, and sometimes even prohibited, either by the church or by the state, or both.

Aside from obvious differences in terminology, the games differed in the equipment used (ball, bat, club, target, etc., which were usually just whatever was available), the way in which the ball is thrown, the method of scoring, the method of making outs, the layout of the field and the number of players involved.

An old English game called "''base,''" described by [[George Ewing]] at [[Valley Forge]], was apparently not much like baseball. There was no bat and no ball involved. The game was more like a fancy game of "tag", although it did share the concept of places of safety (for example, bases) with modern baseball.

In an 1801 book entitled ''The Sports and Pastimes of the People of England'', [[Joseph Strutt (engraver and antiquary)|Joseph Strutt]] claimed to have shown that baseball-like games can be traced back to the 14th century, and that baseball is a descendant of a [[United Kingdom]] game called [[stoolball]]. The earliest known reference to stoolball is in a 1330 poem by [[William Pagula]], who recommended to priests that the game be forbidden within churchyards.

In stoolball, a batter stood before a target, perhaps an upturned stool, while another player pitched a ball to the batter. If the batter hit the ball (with a bat or his/her hand) and it was caught by a fielder, the batter was out. If the pitched ball hit a stool leg, the batter was out. It was more often played by young men and women as a sort of [[spin the bottle]].

According to many sources, in 1700, a [[Puritan]] leader of southern [[England]], [[Thomas Wilson (bishop)|Thomas Wilson]], expressed his disapproval of "[[Morris dance|Morris-dancing]], cudgel-playing, baseball and [[cricket]]" occurring on Sundays. However, David Block, in ''[[Baseball Before We Knew It]]'' (2005), reports that the original source has "stoolball" for "baseball". Block also reports that the reference appears to date to 1672, rather than 1700.

A 1744 publication in England by [[John Newbery]] called ''[[A Little Pretty Pocket-Book]]'' includes a [[woodcut]] of stoolball and a rhyme entitled "Base-ball."  This is the first known instance of the word baseball in print. <ref>[[John Lloyd (writer)|Lloyd, J]] & [[John Mitchinson|Mitchinson, J]]: "[[The Book of General Ignorance]]". Faber & Faber, 2006.</ref> The book was very popular in England, and was later published in [[Colonial America]] in 1762. <ref>[[John Lloyd (writer)|Lloyd, J]] & [[John Mitchinson|Mitchinson, J]]: "[[The Book of General Ignorance]]". Faber & Faber, 2006.</ref> In 1748, the family of [[Frederick, Prince of Wales]] partook in the playing of a baseball-like game. The diarist William Bray recorded a game of baseball on Easter Monday 1755 in [[Guildford]]<ref>BBC [http://news.bbc.co.uk/today/hi/today/newsid_7609000/7609897.stm History of baseball exposed] 11 September 2008</ref>.

A 1791 bylaw in [[Pittsfield, Massachusetts]] bans the playing of baseball within 80 yards of the town meeting house.

French book ''[[Les Jeux des Jeunes Gar<U+00E7>ons]]'' is the first known book to contain printed rules of a bat/base/running game. It was printed in [[Paris, France]] in 1810 and lays out the rules for "poison ball," in which there were two teams of eight to ten players, four bases (one called home), a pitcher, a batter, and flyball outs.

Another early print reference is [[Jane Austen]]'s novel ''[[Northanger Abbey]]'', originally written 1798-1799. In the first chapter the young heroine is described as preferring "cricket, baseball, riding on horseback and running about the country to books". <ref>[[John Lloyd (writer)|Lloyd, J]] & [[John Mitchinson|Mitchinson, J]]: "[[The Book of General Ignorance]]". Faber & Faber, 2006.</ref>

In 1828, [[William Clarke]] in [[London]], published the second edition of ''[[The Boy<U+2019>s Own Book]]'' which included rules of rounders. Similar rules were published in [[Boston, Massachusetts]] in "The Book of Sports", written by Robin Carver in 1834, <ref>[[John Lloyd (writer)|Lloyd, J]] & [[John Mitchinson|Mitchinson, J]]: "[[The Book of General Ignorance]]". Faber & Faber, 2006.</ref> except the Boston version called the game "Base" or "Goal ball." The rules were identical to those of poison ball, but also added fair and foul balls and strike outs.

Also, in 1828, an article published in a Hagerstown, Maryland, newspaper briefly describes a young girl who's drawn away from her daily chores to play a familiar game with her friends. In "A Village Sketch," author Miss Mitford wrote: "Then comes a sun-burnt gipsy of six, beginning to grow tall and thin and to find the cares of the world gathering about her; with a pitcher in one hand, a mop in the other, an old straw bonnet of ambiguous shape, half hiding her tangled hair; a tattered stuff petticoat once green, hanging below an equally tattered cotton frock, once purple; her longing eyes fixed on a game of baseball at the corner of the green till she reaches the cottage door, flings down the mop and pitcher and darts off to her companions quite regardless of the storm of scolding with which the mother follows her runaway steps." <ref>The Torch Light and Public Advertiser (Hagerstown, MD), 27 November 1828.</ref>

The account by [[Fred Lillywhite]] (1829-66) of the first English [[cricket]] tour to Canada and the United States in 1859 refers to the "base-ball game [being] somewhat similar to the English and Irish game of "rounders"". A day's play was lost during a cricket match in New York due to snow, but a game of baseball was arranged about a mile away between "the players of that game and a portion of the English party" (''The English Cricketers' Trip to Canada and the United States'', 1860).

A unique British sport, known as [[British baseball|British Baseball]], is still played in parts of [[Wales]] and [[England]]. Although confined mainly to the cities of [[Cardiff]], [[Newport]] and [[Liverpool]], the sport boasts an annual international game between representative teams from the two countries.

===Stoolball===
Origins of [[Stoolball]]:

# In stoolball, which developed by the 11th century, one player throws the ball at a target while another player defends the target. "Stob-ball" and "stow-ball" were regional games similar to stoolball.  In stob ball and stow ball the target was probably a tree stump, since both "''stob''" and "''stow''" mean ''stump'' in some dialects. ( "''Stow''" could also refer to a type of frame used in mining). What the target originally was in stoolball is not certain. It could have been a stump, since <U+201C>''stool''<U+201D> in old Sussex dialect means ''stump''. 
# According to one legend, milkmaids played stoolball while waiting for their husbands to return from the fields. Another theory is that stoolball developed as a game played after attending church services, in which case the target was probably a church stool. 

Originally, the stool was defended with a bare hand. Later, a bat of some kind was used (in modern stoolball, a bat like a very heavy ping-pong paddle is used). 

Clear regional variation:

There were several versions of stoolball. In the earliest versions, the object was primarily to defend the stool. Successfully defending the stool counted for one point, and the batter was out if the ball hit the stool. There was no running involved. Another version of stoolball involved running between two stools, and scoring was similar to the scoring in cricket. In perhaps yet another version there were several stools, and points were scored by running around them as in baseball. 

Because of the different versions of stoolball, and because it was played not only in England, but also in colonial America, stoolball is considered by many to have been the basis of not only cricket, but both baseball and rounders as well.

===Dog and cat===
Another early folk game was "cat and dog" (or "dog and cat"), which probably originated in [[Scotland]]. In cat and dog a piece of wood called a ''cat'' is thrown at a hole in the ground while another player defends the hole with a stick (a ''dog''). In some cases there were two holes and, after hitting the cat, the batter would run between them while fielders would try to put the runner out by putting the ball in the hole before the runner got to it. Dog and cat thus resembled cricket.

===Cricket===
The [[history of cricket]] prior to 1650 is something of a mystery. Games believed to have been similar to cricket had developed by the 13th century. There was a game called "creag", and another game, "Handyn and Handoute" (Hands In and Hands Out), which was made illegal in 1477 by [[King Edward IV]], who considered the game childish, and a distraction from compulsory archery practice. 

References to a game actually called "''cricket''" appeared around 1550. It is believed that the word ''cricket'' is based either on the word ''cric'', meaning a crooked stick possibly a shepherd's crook (early forms of cricket used a curved bat somewhat like a hockey stick), or on the Flemish word "''krickstoel''", which refers to a stool upon which one kneels in church.

There was at least one official Cricket Club open to membership, established in 1846 in the US at New York. However it appears the popularity of the sport waned during the US civil war, leaving baseball to become the more popular sport.

===Cat, One Old Cat===
{{see also|Old Cat}}

A game popular in colonial America was "one hole catapult", which used a catapult like the one used in trap-ball.

The game of "cat" (or "''cat-ball''") had many variations but usually there was a pitcher, a catcher, a batter and fielders, but there were no sides (and often no bases to run). A feature of some versions of cat that would later become a feature of baseball was that a batter would be out if he swung and missed three times. 

Another game that was popular in early America was "one ol' cat", the name of which was possibly originally a contraction of ''one hole catapult''. In one ol' cat, when a batter is put out, the catcher goes to bat, the pitcher catches, a fielder becomes the pitcher, and other fielders move up in rotation. One ol' cat was often played when there weren't enough players to choose up sides and play townball. Sometimes running to a base and back was involved. "Two ol' cat" was the same game as one ol' cat, except that there were two batters.

==The Abner Doubleday myth ==
[[Image:Doubledayo.jpg|thumb|200px|Abner Doubleday]]
The myth that [[Abner Doubleday]] invented baseball in 1839 was once widely promoted and widely believed. There was and is no evidence for this claim, except for the testimony of one man decades after the fact, and there is ''more persuasive'' counter-evidence.  Doubleday himself never made such a claim; he left many letters and papers, but they contain no description of baseball or even a suggestion that he considered himself a prominent person in the history of the game.  His ''[[New York Times]]'' obituary makes no mention of baseball at all, nor does an encyclopedia article about Doubleday published in 1911.  Contrary to popular belief, Doubleday was never inducted into the [[Baseball Hall of Fame]], although a large oil portrait of him was on display at the Hall of Fame building for many years.

Doubleday's invention of baseball was invented by baseball, in a sense. It was the finding of a panel appointed by [[Albert Spalding]], once a star pitcher, then a club executive, who had become the leading [[United States|American]] sporting goods entrepreneur and sports publisher.  Debate on baseball origins had raged for decades, heating up in the first years of the 20th century.  To end argument, speculation and innuendo, Spalding organized the Mills Commission in 1905.  The members were baseball figures, not historians: Spalding's friend [[Abraham G. Mills]], a former [[National League]] president; two [[United States Senate|United States Senators]], former NL president Morgan Bulkeley and former Washington club president Arthur Gorman; former NL president and lifelong secretary-treasurer Nick Young; two other star players turned sporting goods entrepreneurs ([[George Wright (sportsman)|George Wright]] and [[Alfred Reach]]); and AAU president James E. Sullivan.<ref>This list of panelists and the organization and publication dates follow "The Mills Commission" in "The Origins of the National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum" by that institution. The Hall and Museum owes its Cooperstown location and its 1839 birth date, at least, to the Mills Commission finding.</ref>

The final report published in 1908 included three sections: a summary of the panel<U+2019>s findings written by Mills, a letter by [[John Montgomery Ward]] supporting the panel, and a dissenting opinion by [[Henry Chadwick]]. The research methods were, at best, dubious. The Commission probably looked for and found the perfect story: baseball was invented in a quaint rural town without foreigners or industry, by a young man who later graduated from [[United States Military Academy|West Point]] and served heroically in the [[Mexican-American War]], [[American Civil War|Civil War]], and U.S. wars against Indians.

The Mills Commission concluded that baseball had been invented by Doubleday in [[Cooperstown, New York]] in 1839; that Doubleday had invented the word "baseball", designed the diamond, indicated fielder positions, written down the rules and the field regulations. However, no written records from 1839 or the 1840s have ever been found to corroborate these claims; nor could Doubleday be interviewed (he had died in 1893). The principal source for the story was one letter from elderly [[Abner Graves]], who was a five-year-old resident of Cooperstown in 1839. But Graves never mentioned a diamond, positions or the writing of rules. Graves' reliability as a witness has also been questioned because he was later convicted of murdering his wife and spent his final days in an asylum for the criminally insane. Further, Doubleday was not in Cooperstown in 1839 and may never have visited the town. <ref>[[John Lloyd (writer)|Lloyd, J]] & [[John Mitchinson|Mitchinson, J]]: "[[The Book of General Ignorance]]". Faber & Faber, 2006.</ref> He was enrolled at [[United States Military Academy|West Point]] and there is no record of any leave time.  Mills, a lifelong friend of Doubleday, had never heard him mention baseball.

As noted previously, versions of baseball rules, and descriptions of similar games, have since been found in publications that significantly predate the alleged invention in 1839.

[[Jeff Idelson]] of the [[Baseball Hall of Fame]] in [[Cooperstown, New York]] has stated, "Baseball wasn't really born anywhere," meaning that the evolution of the game was long and continuous and has no clear, identifiable single origin.

==Alexander Cartwright==
[[Image:Alexander Cartwright Baseball.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Alexander Cartwright]]
The first published rules of baseball were written in 1845 for a New York (Manhattan) base ball club called the [[New York Knickerbockers|Knickerbockers]]. The author, [[Alexander Joy Cartwright]], is one person commonly known as "the father of baseball". Evolution from so-called "[[Knickerbocker Rules]]" to the current rules is fairly well documented. 

On June 3, 1953, Congress officially credited Cartwright with inventing the modern game of baseball, and he is a member of the Baseball Hall of Fame.  However, the role of Cartwright himself has been disputed.  His authorship is sometimes called a significant exaggeration, a modern attempt to identify a single "inventor" of the game (akin to the Doubleday myth).  Nonetheless, Cartwright, a New York bookseller who caught "gold fever," did succeed in introducing the game in most cities where he stopped on his trek west to California.  One point undisputed by historians is the direct evolution from amateur ''urban'' clubs of the 1840s and 1850s, ''not'' the pastures of the small Cooperstowns of America, to the modern professional major leagues that began in the 1870s.

==Before 1845==
Evolution of the game that became modern baseball is unknown before 1845.  The Knickerbocker Rules describe a game that they had been playing for some time. But how long is uncertain and so is how that game had developed. 

There were once two camps. One, mostly English, asserted that baseball evolved from a game of English origin (probably rounders); the other, almost entirely American, said that baseball was an American invention (perhaps derived from the game of one ol' cat). Apparently they saw their positions as mutually exclusive. Some of their points seem more national loyalty than evidence: Americans tended to reject any suggestion that baseball evolved from an English game, while some English observers concluded that baseball was little more than their rounders without the round. 

===Cricket and Rounders===
That baseball is based on English and Gaelic games such as cat, [[cricket]], and [[rounders]] is difficult to dispute. On the other hand, baseball has many elements that are uniquely American. The earliest published author to muse on the origin of baseball, [[John Montgomery Ward]], was suspicious of the often-parroted claim that rounders is the direct ancestor of baseball, as both were formalized in the same time period. He concluded, with some amount of patriotism, that baseball evolved separately from town-ball (rounders) out of children's safe haven ball games.<ref>[http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/19975 Base-Ball: How to Become a Player by J.M. Ward]</ref>

Certainly baseball is ''related'' to cricket and rounders, but exactly how, or how closely, has not been established. The only certain thing is that modern cricket is much older than modern baseball.

Games played with [[bat-and-ball]] together may all be distant cousins; the same goes for base-and-ball games.  Bat, base, and ball games for two teams that alternate in and out, such as baseball, cricket, and rounders, are likely to be close cousins.  They all involve throwing a ball to a batsman who attempts to "bat" it away and run safely to a base, while the opponent tries to put the batter-runner out when liable ("liable to be put out" is the baseball term for unsafe).

==Elysian Fields==
[[Image:baseball1866.JPG|thumb|350px|Early baseball game played at Elysian Fields, Hoboken (Currier & Ives lithograph).]]
In 1845, the [[New York Knickerbockers|Knickerbocker Club]] of [[New York City]] began using [[Elysian Fields, Hoboken, New Jersey|Elysian Fields]] in [[Hoboken, New Jersey|Hoboken]] to play [[baseball]] due to the lack of soft grounds on [[Manhattan]].  In 1846, the Knickerbockers played the [[New York Nine]] on these grounds in the first organized game between two clubs.  A plaque, and baseball diamond street pavings at 11th and Washington Streets commemorate the event.  By the 1850s, several Manhattan-based members of the [[National Association of Base Ball Players]] were using the grounds as their home field.

In 1865 the grounds hosted a championship match between the [[New York Mutuals|Mutual Club]] of [[New York City|New York]] and the [[Brooklyn Atlantics|Atlantic Club]] of [[Brooklyn]] that was attended by an estimated 20,000 fans and captured in the [[Currier & Ives]] [[lithograph]] "The American National Game of Base Ball".

With the construction of two significant baseball parks enclosed by fences in [[Brooklyn]], enabling promoters there to charge admission to games, the prominence of [[Elysian Fields, Hoboken, New Jersey|Elysian Fields]] began to diminish.  In 1868 the leading [[Manhattan]] club, [[New York Mutuals|Mutual]], shifted its home games to the [[Union Grounds]] in [[Brooklyn]].  In 1880, the founders of the [[New York Metropolitans]] and [[San Francisco Giants|New York Giants]] finally succeeded in siting a ballpark in Manhattan that became known as the [[Polo Grounds]].

==After 1845==
In 1857, sixteen clubs from modern [[New York City]] sent delegates to a convention that standardized the rules, essentially by agreeing to revise the Knickerbocker rules. In 1858, twenty-five including one from New Jersey founded a going concern but the [[National Association of Baseball Players|National Association of Base Ball Players]] is conventionally dated from 1857. It governed through 1870 but it scheduled and sanctioned no games. 

By 1862 some NABBP member clubs offered games to the general public in enclosed ballparks with admission fees.

During and after the [[American Civil War]], the movements of soldiers and exchanges of prisoners helped spread the game. As of the December 1865 meeting, the year the war ended, there were isolated Association members in [[Fort Leavenworth, Kansas|Fort Leavenworth]], [[St. Louis]], [[Louisville, Kentucky|Louisville]], and [[Chattanooga, Tennessee]], along with about 90 members north and east of [[Washington]].

In 1869 the first openly professional baseball team formed. Earlier players were nominally amateurs. The [[Cincinnati Red Stockings]] recruited nationally and effectively, toured nationally, and no one beat them until June [[1870 in sports|1870]].

Already in the 19th century, the "old game" was invoked for special exhibitions such as reunions and anniversaries <U+2014> and for making moral points. Today hundreds of clubs in the U.S. play "vintage base ball" according to the 1845, 1858, or later rules (up to about [[1887 in baseball|1887]]), usually in vintage uniforms.  Some of them have supporting casts that recreate period dress and manner, especially those associated with [[living history]] museums.
