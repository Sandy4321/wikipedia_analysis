== EASY CHANGE Gullet System ==

The EASY CHANGE Gullet System was designed in 1998 to help custom fit a saddle to a horse<U+2019>s [[withers]] <ref>[http://www.thehorse.com/ViewArticle.aspx?ID=4285&kw=gullet The Horse: The Right Saddle for the Job<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> and help maintain a good saddle fit <ref>http://www.chirovet.com.au/articles/buyingDressageSaddle.pdf</ref>. As horses constantly change shape the ability to change gullets allows the saddle to maintain clearance of the wither according to the horse<U+2019>s shape.

== CAIR Panel System ==

The CAIR Panel System, an air filled panel was developed in 2000 as an alternative to the traditional flocking in saddles <ref>[http://www.thehorse.com/ViewArticle.aspx?ID=4285&nID=2&n=General%20Equipment%20Information&case=2 The Horse: The Right Saddle for the Job<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>. Flocking often becomes compacted, restricting the horses in their movements and often causing damage through pressure points. Air being a fluid medium helps to evenly distribute the rider<U+2019>s weight across the length of the panel <ref>[http://www.thehorse.com/ViewArticle.aspx?ID=5393 The Horse: AAEP 2004: Evaluating Saddle Fit<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> <ref>http://www.chirovet.com.au/articles/SADDLE_FIT_version_1204.pdf</ref>. CAIR offers excellent comfort for the horse as it conforms to the horse's movements and posture <ref>http://www.chirovet.com.au/articles/buyingDressageSaddle.pdf</ref>
