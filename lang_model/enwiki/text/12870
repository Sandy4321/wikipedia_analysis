'''Dasani''' ({{pronEng|d<U+0259><U+02C8>s<U+0251><U+02D0>ni}}) is a [[brand]] of [[bottled water]] from the [[Coca-Cola]] company, launched in 1999, after the success of [[Aquafina]] (produced by Coca-Cola-rival [[PepsiCo]]). It is one of many brands of Coca-Cola bottled water sold around the world.
Dasani water differs in composition between its national markets{{Dubious|water is water|date=May 2009}}.  Dasani has a strong product placement marketing campaign appearing in movies like 'You Got Served' to the TV series 'West Wing'.  People have been perplexed by the mysterious origin of the name "Dasani". One Coca- Cola executive jokingly said it sounded like a `Roman god of water.` Actually, the name Dasani is an original creation - it was chosen when consumer testing showed that the name was relaxing and suggested "pureness" and "replenishment".

Dasani had to be withdrawn in the UK due to contamination with [[bromate]], a suspected [[carcinogen]], produced by the treatment process used on the water <ref>{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/3550063.stm | title=Coke recalls controversial water | publisher=BBC |date=2004-03-19}}</ref>

==United States==
Coca-Cola uses tap water from local municipal water supplies, [[Filter (water)|filters]] it using the process of [[reverse osmosis]] and adds trace amounts of [[mineral]]s, including [[magnesium sulfate]] (Epsom salt), [[potassium chloride]], 
Regular Dasani water comes in the following sizes: 12 oz; 20 oz; 24 oz 'Sports Cap Bottle'; 1 L; 1.5 L; 300 mL; 12 oz [[fridge]] pack; 500 mL 6, 12, and 24-pack; and the 24 oz 6-pack.

The Dasani brand includes flavored water, which use the sweetener [[sucralose]] (sold under the [[Tate & Lyle]] brand name "Splenda") as a sweetener. The flavors are [[lemon]], [[grape]], [[raspberry]], and [[strawberry]]. The flavored varieties are sold as 20 [[fluid ounce]] bottles, 500 [[litre|ml]] 6-packs, and 12 oz 8-packs.

The new ''Plus'' product line is similar to the flavored variety, only differing in the fact that these have added vitamins and some different flavors [[Pomegranate]]-[[Blackberry]], [[Orange (fruit)|Orange]]-[[Tangerine]], [[Kiwi]]-[[Strawberry]] and [[lemon lime flavors]]. Dasani Plus comes in a 20 oz bottle.

==Canada==
Dasani was launched in all provinces of [[Canada]] except [[Quebec]] in 2000, a year after launching in the United States. The brand was made available in [[Quebec]] shortly afterwards, in April 2001. 

There are four common Dasani bottle sizes sold in Canada: 300 mL, 500mL, 591 mL, 710 mL, 1 [[litre|L]], and 1.5 L. Bottles are sold individually and in packs of 6, 12, and 24. 

The first source of Dasani water in Canada was [[Calgary, Alberta]]<ref>[http://www.cbc.ca/money/story/2004/03/24/coke040324.html Coca-Cola pulls Dasani launch in Europe<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>.  A second bottling plant was later opened in Brampton, Ontario.  The Calgary and Brampton plants produce Coca-Cola's plain-water (Dasani) and sugar-water (soft drinks) products.  The company's administrative and marketing activities continue to be based in Atlanta, Georgia.

Dasani has <35 [[parts per million|ppm]] of total dissolved mineral salts {{Fact|date=May 2009}}.

In early 2005, two flavored versions of Dasani were introduced: Dasani With Lemon and Dasani With Raspberry. Dasani with Strawberry has since been introduced. The flavored beverages are sweetened with sucralose, a controversial  {{Fact|date=May 2009}} chlorinated sugar.

==Latin America==
Dasani was introduced to the [[Brazil]]ian market in mid-2003, renamed as ''Aquarius''. It was introduced to the [[Chile]]an market in 2005, including releases in regular, lemon and [[tangerine]] flavors. It was released in [[Colombia]] in late 2005 with their three regular flavors. In 2005, Dasani was introduced in the [[Argentinia]]n market with the flavours [[peach]], lemon, [[citrus]] and regular. It was also released under the name ''[[Ciel (beverage)|Ciel]] Dasani'' in [[Mexico]] in four flavors: lemon-cucumber, papaya-carrot, grapefruit and mandarin-green tea, but it was discontinued in 2006. It was also released in [[Ecuador]], [[Paraguay]], [[Uruguay]] and [[Peru]] .

==United Kingdom==
Dasani was launched in the [[United Kingdom|UK]] on 10 February 2004. The product launch was labelled "a disaster"<ref name="BBC">{{cite web|author=Bill Garrett|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/3809539.stm|title="Coke's water bomb"|work=[[BBC News Online]]|date=2004-06-16|accessdate=2008-06-21}}</ref>, a "fiasco"<ref name="indy">{{cite web|author=Michael McCarthy|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/environment/pure-cokes-attempt-to-sell-tap-water-backfires-in-cancer-scare-567004.html|title="Pure? Coke's attempt to sell tap water backfires in cancer scare"|work=[[The Independent]]|date=2004-03-20|accessdate=2008-06-21}}</ref> and a "PR catastrophe"<ref name="indy"/>.

Early advertisements referred to Dasani as "bottled spunk" or featured the tagline "can't live without spunk". "Spunk" is [[slang]] for [[semen]] in the UK.<ref name=Vance>{{cite web | title=Coke's spunky water pulled from UK market | author=Ashlee Vance | publisher=The Register | date=2004-03-19 | url=http://www.theregister.co.uk/2004/03/19/cokes_spunky_water_pulled}}</ref><ref name=Haines>{{cite web | title=Introducing Dasani <U+2013> the water with added, er, protein | author=Lester Haines | publisher=The Register | date=2004-03-11 | url=http://www.theregister.com/2004/03/11/introducing_dasani_the_water}}</ref>

Prior to the launch, an article in ''[[The Grocer]]'' trade magazine had mentioned that the source of the Dasani brand water was in fact treated tap water from [[Sidcup]]. By early March 2004, the mainstream press had picked up on the story<ref>{{cite web|author=Matthew Beard|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/food-and-drink/news/the-real-thing-cokes-water-comes-straight-from-the-tap-with-a-cool-markup-of-3000-per-cent-571780.html|title="The real thing? Coke's water comes straight from the tap with a cool mark-up of 3,000 per cent"|work=[[The Independent]]|date=2004-03-02|accessdate=2008-06-21}}</ref> and it became widely reported that Sidcup tap water was being treated, bottled and sold under the Dasani brand name in the UK.<ref name="BBC"/> Although [[Coca-Cola]] never implied that the water was being sourced from a [[spring (hydrosphere)|spring]] or other natural source, they marketed it as being especially "pure". This led the [[Food Standards Agency]] to request [[London Borough of Hillingdon|Hillingdon]] [[trading standards]] officers to launch an investigation into whether the claim was accurate.<ref>{{cite web|author=Matthew Beard|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/inquiry-into-cokes-tap-water-571926.html|title="Inquiry into Coke's tap water"|work=[[The Independent]]|date=2004-03-03|accessdate=2008-06-21}}</ref>

The media made mocking parallels with [[Mother Nature's Son (Only Fools and Horses)|a popular episode]] of the well-known [[BBC]] [[sitcom]] ''[[Only Fools and Horses]]'', in which protagonist [[Del Boy]] attempts to pass off local tap water as bottled "Peckham Spring".<ref name="BBC"/> Del's scheme fails when he pollutes the local reservoir, causing the bottled water to glow yellow.

On 18 March 2004, UK authorities found a concentration of [[bromate]], a suspected human carcinogen, in the product that could be considered harmful if consumed in large quantities. Dasani was thus potentially [[carcinogenic]]. Coca-Cola immediately recalled half a million bottles and pulled the "Dasani" brand from the UK market.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/3550063.stm | title=Coke recalls controversial water | publisher=BBC |date=2004-03-19}}</ref> Shortly after, plans to introduce the brand to [[Continental Europe]] were announced to have been canceled as well. Ironically, bromate was not present in the water before Coca-Cola's treatment process. During that process the bromate was produced from the water's [[bromide]].

Coca-Cola intended to launch Dasani as a natural [[spring (hydrosphere)|spring water]] in [[France]] and [[Germany]], although this never went ahead after bad publicity in the [[United Kingdom]].
