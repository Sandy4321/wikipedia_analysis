The '''Numedal Line''' ({{Lang-no|Numedalsbanen}}) is a {{convert|92.8|km|adj=on|sp=us}} long [[railway line]] that runs up the [[Numedal]] valley between [[Kongsberg]] and [[R<U+00F8>dberg]] in [[Buskerud]], [[Norway]]. Built and operated by the [[Norwegian State Railways]], the non-electrified, [[standard gauge]] line passes through the municipalities of Kongsberg, [[Flesberg]], [[Rollag]] and [[Nore og Uvdal]]. It is now owned by the [[Norwegian National Rail Administration]].

The first plans for a line through Numedal were launched after the [[S<U+00F8>rland Line]] reached in Kongsberg in 1871. After it was decided that the [[Bergen Line]] would instead follow [[Hallingdal]], the Numedal plans lay dead until it was decided that a railway was necessary to build two hydroelectric power stations near R<U+00F8>dberg. The plans were passed in 1918, the first trains started running in 1924 and the line was officially opened in 1927. At first all services were provided with [[steam locomotive]]s, but from the 1930s [[diesel multiple unit]]s were used for passenger trains. The line was frequented with classes [[NSB Class Cmd 16|Cmd 16]], [[NSB Class 86|86]], [[NSB Class 87|87]] and [[NSB Class 91|91]]. The last regular train ran in 1988; since, there has been sporadic freight service and some heritage trains running from Kongsberg to Rollag. [[Draisine]] rental is available on the section from Veggli to R<U+00F8>dberg. The line is proposed to be preserved as a [[cultural heritage]].

==History==
[[File:Gvammen stasjon Numedalsbanen.jpg|thumb|left|Gvammen Station]]

With the construction of the S<U+00F8>rland Line to Kongsberg, which opened on 10 November 1871, proposals were launched to extend the line up Numedal. On 16 August 1873, a meeting was held between representatives from the municipalities in Numedal to discuss how they could convince national politicians to build the Bergen Line through Numedal.<ref name=db15>Dahlen and Borgersen (1989): 15</ref> However, instead the Bergen Line was decided to run through Hallingdal. What finally spurred the construction was the construction of [[hydroelectric]] power stations in the valley. In 1907, the government, through [[Statkraft|its power agency]], had secured rights to build a power station in the rivers [[Numedalsl<U+00E5>gen]] and [[Tunnhovdfjorden]].<ref>Aspenberg (1994): 125</ref> The state saw it as advantageous to build a railway through the valley to aid construction of [[Nore I Power Station|Nore I]] and Nore II Power Station, despite the line not being on the railway plan.<ref name=a126>Aspenberg (1994): 126</ref> This was because machines weighting up to {{convert|40|t}} would have to be transported up the valley. The initial estimates for the line was a cost of 8.3 million [[Norwegian krone]] (NOK).<ref name=db15 />

[[File:Numedalsbanen Rollag.jpg|thumb|left|The station area at Rollag]]
On 3 August 1918, the line was passed by the [[Parliament of Norway]] and it was decided that the line was to be built with standard gauge, which by then had become the norm. The decision was controversial, as the line was expected to have little traffic and would therefore not be profitable. A minority of the  parliamentarians instead wanted the line to be built with [[narrow gauge]] to reduce construction costs.<ref name=a126 /> The state required that local municipalities and counties contributed to some of the investment costs. NOK&nbsp;1.2 million was paid by [[Buskerud County Municipality]], while NOK&nbsp;2.17 million million was paid by the various municipalities. The largest amounts were paid by Flesberg with NOK&nbsp;635,000, [[Nore]] with NOK&nsbp;615,000 and Rollag with NOK&nbsp;517,000, while [[Uvdal]] paid NOK&nbsp;198,000, Kongsberg NOK&nbsp;125,000 and Drammen NOK&nbsp;80,000.<ref name=db19>Dahlen and Borgersen (1989): 19</ref>

[[File:Bakkerud stasjon Numedalsbanen.jpg|thumb|left|Bakkerud Station]]
Siting commenced in 1918, and by 1919, an administration for the works had been established in Kongsberg. Construction commenced on 2 July 1920, between Fossan and Bratterud. However, there quickly arose a [[strike action|strike]], resulting in construction not being taken up until March 1921. Final approval by parliament was first made on 20 July 1921.<ref name=db9>Dahlen and Borgersen (1989): 9</ref> Most of the construction was done using hand tools. {{Convert|543000|m3|sp=us}} of earth was moved, {{convert|217000|m3|sp=us}} of rock was [[blasted]] and {{convert|2.3|km|sp=us}} of tunnel were built. {{Convert|190000|m3|sp=us}} of [[track ballast|ballast stone]] were used, most of it from the gravel pits at Bevergrenda, Guribr<U+00E5>ten and Stevningsmogen, Tjuvhaugen and Skarpsmoen. The whole construction used seven million work hours and for the tunneling, each work hour gave {{convert|7|mm}} of progress. Most of the [[rail track|tracks]] were used from other railways. Five of the station buildings, at Vangestad, Flesberg, Djupdal, Tr<U+00E5>en and Kravikfjord, were workmen's sheds which had been placed on a foundation.<ref name=db17>Dahlen and Borgersen (1989): 17</ref>

From 1924, the railway was taken partially into use. Trains could run the {{convert|36|km|sp=us}} from Kongsberg to Bakker<U+00F8>d from 15 November 1924, the  {{convert|65|km|sp=us}} to Kj<U+00E6>rre from 1 December 1925 and to R<U+00F8>dberg from 1 December 1926.<ref name=a127>Aspenberg (1994): 127</ref> These trains included transport of {{convert|950|t}} of cement and {{convert|590|t}} for the railway bridges. In total 4,300 wagon loads were transported before the official opening, of which about half was for the power stations. Because of the delay of building the line, it could only be used during part of the construction period for the power stations.<ref name=db9 />

[[File:Flesberg stasjon.jpg|thumb|left|Flesberg Station]]
The official opening took place on 19 November 1927 by [[Haakon VII of Norway|King Haakon VII]].<ref name=db15 /> When the line opened there were 21 manned station on the line. Up to 70 people worked on the line, in addition to station employees.<ref name=db19 /> In 1932, the operations were rationalized, cutting costs from NOK&nbsp;426,000 to NOK&nbsp;310,000 per year. This involved removing the station masters at fifteen stations and replacing them with a clerk.<ref>{{cite news |title=Innskrenkninger ved Numedalsbanen i 1932 |url=http://www.laagendalsposten.no/article/20090226/KULTUR/775706289 |date=26 February 2009 |work=[[Laagendalsposten]] |language=Norwegian |accessdate=30 April 2010 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5pNN5yehk |archivedate=30 April 2010}}</ref>

Initially, all trains on the line were hauled by [[steam locomotives]], in particular [[NSB Class 20]] and [[NSB Class 21]] brought in used from other lines. The first [[diesel multiple unit]]s were taken into use in the 1930s, with the line seeing the use of both [[NSB Class Cmb 16]] and ''Kristine Valdresdatter''. During [[World War II]], the line was again entirely hauled by steam locomotives and the service was reduced considerably. By 1945, there were three round trips per week, but after the war ended, the frequency increased and by 1947 there were four daily round trips. Various classes of multiple units have been used, including [[NSB Class 86]], [[NSB Class 87]] and [[NSB Class 91]]. During the 1950s, there were sometimes also trains that operated just from Kongsberg to Veggli.<ref name=a127 />

[[File:Numedalsbanen Roedberg.jpg|thumb|left|R<U+00F8>dberg Station was the terminus of the line.]]
Because the conductors and engineers often knew where the locals lived or were headed, trains would make non-scheduled stops to disembark passengers to allow them a shorter walk.<ref name=db19 /> In the 1960s, the number of round trips was reduced to three per day, allowing the whole service to be operated with a single unit.<ref name=a127 /> NSB used steam power for freight trains until 1970, when NSB's last scheduled steam locomotive service hauled a gravel train from Svene to Kongsberg.<ref name=a128>Aspenberg (1994): 128</ref> For a short period during the 1980s, there were also school trains, but as this forced NSB to operate two multiple units on the line, it proved too expensive and was soon afterwards again provided by bus.<ref name=a127 />

Discussion about closing the line started in the 1950s, and the line became a candidate every time NSB and the parliament discussed closures. In 1988, the parliament decided to close many Norwegian lines, including the Numedal Line, although it was decided that the section from Kongsberg to Rollag was to be kept for freight traffic. The last passenger train operated on 31 December 1988 and the line north of Rollag was officially closed on 1 January 1989.<ref name=a131>Aspenberg (1994): 131</ref> By the time the line closed in 1989, manning remained at only three stations: Flesberg, Veggli and R<U+00F8>dberg.<ref name=db19 /> NSB retained some traffic south of Flesberg; in 1993 the company hauled {{convert|30000|t}} of gravel and {{convert|25000|t}} of lumber along the line.<ref name=a131 />

After the closure, the non-profit organization Friends of the Numedal Line was established and offered occasional [[heritage railway|heritage]] rides along the line.<ref name=a131 /> It maintains the tracks between Rollag and R<U+00F8>dberg and offers [[draisine]] rental between Veggli and R<U+00F8>dberg.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.numedalsbanen.no/default.aspx?MenuID=8692 |title=Dresinsykling |publisher=Friends of the Numedal Line |accessdate=30 April 2010 |language=Norwegian |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5pNPoa2AC |archivedate=30 April 2010}}</ref> Irregular transport from the gravel pit at Svene and the sawmill Numedal Bruk at Flesberg.
