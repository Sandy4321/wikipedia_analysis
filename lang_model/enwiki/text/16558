"'''Don't Forget About Us'''" is a song by American [[singer-songwriter]] [[Mariah Carey]]. It was written by Carey, [[Jermaine Dupri]], [[Bryan-Michael Cox]] and [[Johnt<U+00E1> Austin]], and released as the fifth single for the re-issue of her tenth studio album, ''[[The Emancipation of Mimi]]'' (2005). Co-produced by the former three, the song draws influence from [[Contemporary R&B|R&B]] and [[Pop music|pop]] music genres, and lyrically chronicles the emotions felt by the protagonist after their separation. Carey explained that the true meaning of the song is to be interpreted by the listener, therefore not disclosing its entire meaning publicly.

The song received generally mixed reviews from music critics, with many heavily comparing it to Carey's previous single "[[We Belong Together]]". Several reviewers felt the song's similarity marked Carey's lack of creativity with it, while others embraced its radio-friendly formula. "Don't Forget About Us" became Carey's seventeenth chart topping single on the US ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Hot 100]], tying the record for most number-one singles by a solo artist set by [[Elvis Presley]]. Internationally, the song topped the singles chart in Belgium and Finland, and reached the top-ten in Hungary and the Netherlands. 

Carey performed the song at the [[American Music Awards of 2005|33rd annual]] [[American Music Award]]s, and during the [[half-time]] of the Thanksgiving game between the [[Detroit Lions]] and the [[Atlanta Falcons]]. Additionally, the song was included on the set-lists of Carey's [[The Adventures of Mimi Tour|The Adventures of Mimi]] and [[Angels Advocate Tour]]s. The song's music video chronicles the two time frames, Carey in the present, as well as the past memories she shared with her ex-lover that continue to haunt her. At the [[49th Grammy Awards|49th annual]] [[Grammy Award]]s, "Don't Forget About Us" was nominated for two awards during the ceremony held on February 11, 2007.

== Background and recording ==
After being branded Carey's "comeback album" by music critics, and becoming the highest selling album of her career post-''[[Glitter (soundtrack)|Glitter]]'' (2001), ''[[The Emancipation of Mimi]]'' inspired Carey to return to the studio, in hopes of writing and producing new material for her next [[studio album]].<ref name="Vineyard3">{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1512753/marilyn-monroe-inspires-mariah-new-video.jhtml|title=Marilyn Monroe Inspires Mariah To Shed Clothes For New Video|work=[[MTV News]]|publisher=[[MTV Networks]] ([[Viacom]])|accessdate=2011-02-24|date=2005-11-18|first=Jennifer|last=Vineyard}}</ref> During a writing session with [[Jermaine Dupri]], Carey wrote "Don't Forget About Us" as a possible single for her next album, reminiscent of the material on ''Mimi''.<ref name="Vineyard3"/> After hearing the unfinished version of the song, [[L.A.

"Don't Forget About Us" is a [[Tempo|mid-tempo]] song lasting three minutes and fifty-three seconds, while drawing influence from [[Pop music|pop]] and [[Contemporary R&B|R&B]] music genres.<ref name=review>{{cite web|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=BhUEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA69&dq=mariah+carey+%22don't+forget+about+us%22&hl=en&ei=7CsiTur2H5CWtwfezfS3Aw&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CCkQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=mariah%20carey%20%22don't%20forget%20about%20us%22&f=false|title=Essential Reviews|last=Paoletta|first=Michael|work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|publisher=[[Prometheus Global Media]]|date=2005-04-16|accessdate=2011-02-05}}</ref> Written by Carey, [[Jermaine Dupri]], [[Bryan-Michael Cox]] and [[Johnt<U+00E1> Austin]], and produced by the former three, the song drew comparisons to Carey's "[[We Belong Together]]".<ref name=review/> According to Michael Paoletta from ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'', the song features a similar tempo, lyrical style, instrumentation and production as the latter song, and incorporates a reminiscent vocal performance from Carey.<ref name=review/> According to the sheet music published at Musicnotes.com by [[Alfred Music Publishing]], the song is set in [[time signature|common time]] with a moderate [[tempo]] of 72 beats per minute.<ref name=music/> The song is composed in the key of [[G minor]], with Carey's vocal range spanning from the low-note of D<sub>3</sub> to the high-note of F<sub>5</sub>.<ref name=music>{{cite web|url=http://www.musicnotes.com/sheetmusic/mtdVPE.asp?ppn=MN0052527|author=Mariah Carey, Bryan Michael Cox, Jermaine Dupri, Johnt<U+00E1> Austin (Composers and Lyricists)|title=Don't Forget About Us: Mariah Carey Digital Sheet Music|year=2005|accessdate=2011-04-09|work=Musicnotes.com |publisher=[[Alfred Music Publishing]]|format=Musicnotes|at=MN0068511 (Product Number)}}</ref> Lyrically, the song describes the potency of a "first love", and features a protagonist pleading to her lover to "not forget about them". Critics noted that the song's lyrics both let go of a lover, as well as cherishing their memory. Carey sings "Just let it die / With no goodbyes", indicating a relationship that has long decayed, and how she has let it drift away, while also adding "here's only one me and you / And how we used to shine / No matter what you go through / We are one, that's a fact / That you can't deny", indicating that while they are no longer together, she will continue to cherish the memory of them, and how strong their love was.<ref name="Vineyard1"/> According to Carey, she refrained from giving away too much of the song's lyrical meaning, in order to allow fans to possibly interpret the song in their own way:
<blockquote>
I try not to get too specific so that people can apply the lyrics to their own lives. When I was growing up and listening to the radio and I would hear a song that reminded me of a certain person or a situation or whatever, I would want to be able to completely connect it to that moment. And then if I heard someone explaining it and making it into something totally different, it ruined it for me. So I kind of like to keep it open for people's imaginations. It evokes something different depending on who listens to it and at what time. "Don't Forget About Us" could give you a good, happy memory, or you could be miserable, crying, listening to it over and over. All in all, I think it's good to have music you can live vicariously through, and that's what a lot of people have told me this record has been for them.<ref name="Vineyard2"/>
</blockquote>

== Critical reception ==
"Don't Forget About Us" garnered generally positive reviews from music critics, though many compared it to, and felt it shared several similarities with Carey's previous single, "[[We Belong Together]]". Bill Lamb from [[About.com]] rated the song four out of five stars, who while noting the song's careful formula, complimented Carey's more mature and lower range vocals: "Mariah is clearly settling into a more mature style and lower range vocals than in her early career."<ref name=lamb>{{cite web|url=http://top40.about.com/od/onthecharts/a/chart60905.htm|title=Don't Forget About Us: Mariah Carey (Island)|last=Lamb|first=Bill|date=2006-11-05|work=''[[About.com]]''|publisher=[[The New York Times Company]]|accessdate=2011-02-03}}</ref> Additionally, Lamb commented that although not as "strong" as "We Belong Together", the song was marginally better than another single from ''[[The Emancipation of Mimi]]'', "[[Shake It Off]]".<ref name=lamb/> ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]''{{'}}s Michael Paoletta drew heavy comparisons to "We Belong Together", noting the song's similar tempo, lyrical style, instrumentation and vocal stamp.<ref name=review/> He commented that although "Don't Forget About Us" was "satisfying" on its own, it suggested that Carey had hit a creative wall.<ref name=review/> Andre Meyer from [[CBC News]] described the song as "stronger" than anything Carey released from 2001<U+2013>2005, and wrote "[It] cops the jittery R&B vibe that made Destiny<U+2019>s Child so potent."<ref name="Mayer">{{cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/arts/music/carey.html|title=Carey On|last=Meyer|first=Andre|work=[[CBC News]]|publisher=[[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]]|accessdate=2011-02-24|date=2005-12-13}} {{Dead link|date=April 2012|bot=H3llBot}}</ref> Reviewers from ''[[The New Yorker]]'' and ''[[Music Week]]'' were both taken aback by the single, calling it "beautiful" and "gentle", respectively.<ref name=sasha>{{cite news|url=http://books.google.com/books?ei=EYMiTqPeJsjHrQfHz4SDAg&ct=result&id=ISYnAQAAIAAJ&dq=Mariah+Carey+%22Don%27t+Forget+About+Us%22&q=%22Don%27t+Forget+About+Us%22#search_anchor|title=On Top: Mariah Carey's Record-Breaking Career|work=[[The New Yorker]]|publisher=[[Cond<U+00E9> Nast Publications]]|date=2006-04-03|accessdate=2010-12-10}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://goliath.ecnext.com/coms2/gi_0199-5080780/Mariah-Carey-Don-t-Forget.html|title=Mariah Carey: Don't Forget About Us|work=[[Music Week]]|publisher=[[UBM plc]]|date=2005-12-05|accessdate=2011-07-17}}</ref> Todd Martens from the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' compared it heavily to Carey's 2008 single "[[Bye Bye (Mariah Carey song)|Bye Bye]]", describing their piano melody as "a close match".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/extendedplay/2008/04/the-mariah-care.html|title=The Mariah Carey Blitz Is On|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|publisher=[[Tribune Company]]|last=Martens|first=Todd|date=2008-04-11|accessdate=2011-07-17}} {{Dead link|date=April 2012|bot=H3llBot}}</ref> In 2007, "Don't Forget About Us" was nominated for two [[Grammy Award]]s, in the "Best Female R&B Vocal Performance" and "Best R&B Song" categories, although not winning either.<ref name=grammy>{{cite web|url=http://www.grammy.com/nominees/search?artist=mariah+carey&title=&year=All&genre=All|title=Past Winners Search|publisher=[[National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences]]|accessdate=2011-02-05}}</ref>

That shot was totally and completely inspired by 'Something's Got to Give,' Marilyn Monroe's last movie that never got finished. It's an homage to her, because I've never seen anyone re-create it.

=== Synopsis ===
The music video chronicles two alternative time frames, with the first of Carey in the present, tearful and remorseful their separation, while the other of several different past memories in which she shared with her lover. The video begins with Carey wearing a long brown blouse, laying on a sofa in an elegantly furnished home. As the song begins, she stands up and walks around the living room, while remembering and lamenting her failed relationship. As the first memory of Carey and her lover together on a soccer field is shown, she is once again shown in the present, however clothed in a large white sweater while tears trickle down her cheek. As the memory continues of that night on the soccer field, they are seen together, caressing each other and holding each other in a tight embrace. Carey, in the present, makes her way into a heated pool, where she lays her leg on the deck, re-enacting a famed scene from [[Marilyn Monroe]]'s unreleased film, ''[[Something's Got to Give]]'' (1962). The next memory is of the pair together in the same pool, however in happier times. During the song's bridge, the scenes alternate from Carey at her home in the present, to the duo holding each other intimately in a car. The video ends with Carey alone in the car, while wearing her lover's jacket.
