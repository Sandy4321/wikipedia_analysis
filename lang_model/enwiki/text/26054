'''Seia Herennia Sallustia Barbia Orbiana Augusta''' ([[floruit|fl.]] 220s) was an ''[[Augusta (honorific)|Augusta]]'' of the [[Roman Empire]] and briefly the wife of [[Roman Emperor|Emperor]] [[Severus Alexander]]. She was known for her beauty, which was captured in multiple works of art. Following the execution of her father [[Seius Sallustius]], she was exiled to North Africa, after only two years as empress.
