The term '''Deluge''' ({{lang-pl|<U+0420><U+043E>t<U+043E><U+0440>}}, {{lang-lt|Tvanas}}) denotes a series of mid-17th century campaigns in the [[Polish<U+2013>Lithuanian Commonwealth]]. In a wider sense it applies to the period between the [[Khmelnytsky Uprising|Khmelnytsky (Chmielnicki) Uprising]] of 1648 and the [[Truce of Andrusovo]] in 1667, thus comprising the Polish<U+2013>Lithuanian theaters of the [[Russo-Polish War (1654<U+2013>1667)|Russo-Polish]] and [[Second Northern War]]s.<ref>{{cite book|last=Subtelny|first=Orest|title=Ukraine.

== Historical events ==
{{main|Khmelnytsky Uprising|Second Northern War|Russo-Polish War (1654<U+2013>1667)}}

In 1648, the [[Ruthenia]]n feudal lord [[Bohdan Khmelnytsky]] (known in Polish as "Bohdan Chmielnicki") led a popular uprising of [[Zaporozhian Cossacks|Dnieper Cossacks]] and Ukrainian peasants discontented with the rule of [[magnate#Magnates in Poland and Lithuania|Polish and Lithuanian magnates]].

Although the initial phase of the rebellion ended (after much destruction) at the [[Battle of Berestechko]] (1651), it brought into focus the rivalry between [[Russia]] and the Commonwealth for hegemony over the Ukraine area and over the eastern Slavic lands in general. Thus in October 1653 the Russian [[Zemsky Sobor]] declared war on the Commonwealth and in June 1654 the forces of Tsar [[Alexis of Russia]] invaded the eastern half of Poland-Lithuania, starting the [[Russo-Polish War (1654<U+2013>1667)|Russo-Polish War of 1654-1667]]. The [[Swedish Empire]], which technically already was at war with the Commonwealth (a cease fire agreement existed from 1629 that was prolonged 1635 to 1661), invaded (July 1655) and occupied the remaining half of the country.

Two Polish<U+2013>Lithuanian noble princes, [[Janusz Radziwi<U+0142><U+0142> (1612<U+2013>1655)|Janusz Radziwi<U+0142><U+0142>]] and [[Bogus<U+0142>aw Radziwi<U+0142><U+0142>]], subsequently introduced internal disaffection and dissension into the Commonwealth's troubles and began [[negotiation]]s with the [[Monarchy of Sweden|Swedish king]] [[Charles X Gustav of Sweden]] aimed at breaking up the Commonwealth and the [[Polish<U+2013>Lithuanian union]]. They signed the [[Treaty of K<U+0117>dainiai|treaties of K<U+0117>dainiai]] (1655), which envisaged the Radziwi<U+0142><U+0142> princes ruling over two Duchies carved out from the lands of the [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]] under Swedish [[vassal]]age (the [[Union of K<U+0117>dainiai]]).

The Polish<U+2013>Lithuanian King [[John II Casimir Vasa|John II Casimir]] (reigned 1648<U+2013>1668) lacked support amongst the Commonwealth nobility (''[[szlachta]]'') due to his sympathies with absolutist [[Austria]] and his open contempt for the "[[Sarmatism|Sarmatist]]" culture of the nobility.  Earlier, in 1643, John Casimir had become a member of the [[Society of Jesus|Jesuits]] and had received the title of [[cardinal (Catholicism)|Cardinal]].  Nevertheless, in December 1646 John Casimir had returned to Poland and, in October 1647, resigned his position as Cardinal to stand for election for the Polish throne.  He became King in 1648.  However, some of the nobility regarded Charles Gustav (King of Sweden from 1654 to 1660 and John Casimir's cousin) as the legitimate heir to the Polish<U+2013>Lithuanian throne. Many members of the Polish nobility (''[[szlachta]]''), including [[Kanclerz|Deputy Chancellor of the Crown]] [[Hieronim Radziejowski]] and [[Podskarbi|Grand Treasurer of the Crown]] [[Bogus<U+0142>aw Leszczy<U+0144>ski]], regarded [[John II Casimir Vasa|John II Casimir of Poland]] as a weak king or as a "Jesuit-King"; for this or for personal reasons (i.e. [[Bogus<U+0142>aw Leszczy<U+0144>ski|Leszczy<U+0144>ski]] was Protestant and [[Hieronim Radziejowski|Radziejowski]] was an old enemy of the Polish King who had banished him from Poland to exile in Sweden),  they encouraged Charles Gustav to claim the [[Crown of the Kingdom of Poland|Polish crown]].

When the Swedish armies first invaded Poland-Lithuania, the [[Voivode|Voivod]] of [[Pozna<U+0144>]], [[Krzysztof Opali<U+0144>ski]], surrendered [[Greater Poland|Great Poland]] to Charles Gustav. Other areas also surrendered in rapid succession. Almost the whole country followed suit, with the Swedes entering Warsaw unopposed in August 1655 and John Casimir fleeing to [[Silesia]]. However several places still resisted, most remarkably (and symbolically) the monastery at [[Jasna G<U+00F3>ra Monastery|Jasna G<U+00F3>ra]]. Led by The [[Prior|Grand Prior]] [[Augustyn Kordecki]], the garrison of this sanctuary-fortress of Poland held off its enemies in the [[Siege of Jasna G<U+00F3>ra]] (November 1655 to January 1656). The defense of Jasna G<U+00F3>ra galvanized [[Polish resistance movement in World War II|Polish resistance]] against the Swedes. In December 1655 the [[Tyszowce Confederation]] formed in support of the exiled John Casimir.

Spontaneous uprisings started all over the country, attacking the dispersed occupation forces <U+2014> who, in their turn, retaliated. The uprisings soon merged under the leadership of [[Polish Armed Forces|Polish military]] leader [[Stefan Czarniecki]] and Grand Hetman of Lithuania [[Pawe<U+0142> Jan Sapieha]], who started organized counterattacks in order to eliminate those loyal to Charles Gustav. In the end, John II Casimir's supporters crowned him in [[Lviv|Lw<U+00F3>w]] Cathedral in 1656 ([[Lw<U+00F3>w Oath]]). The Commonwealth forces finally drove back the Swedes in 1657.

The Commonwealth also defeated forces from [[Transylvania]] and [[Brandenburg-Prussia]], but the [[Duchy of Prussia]] gained formal Polish recognition of its independence outside of the Polish state ([[Treaty of Wehlau]], 1657).

With the [[Treaty of Hadiach]] on September 16, 1658, the Polish Crown elevated the [[Cossacks]] and [[Ruthenians]] to a position equal to that of Poland and Lithuania in the Polish<U+2013>Lithuanian Union, and in fact transformed the Polish<U+2013>Lithuanian Commonwealth into a [[Polish<U+2013>Lithuanian<U+2013>Ruthenian Commonwealth]] (Polish: ''Rzeczpospolita Trojga Narod<U+00F3>w'', "Commonwealth of Three Nations"). Supported by Cossack [[Hetman]] [[Ivan Vyhovsky]] and the ''[[Starshina|starshyna]]'', the [[treaty]] aimed{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}} to change the face of Eastern Europe. However, the terms of the treaty never came into full operation: [[Russia]] refused to recognize Hadiach, and maintained its claims to [[Ukraine]].

The [[Russo-Polish War (1654<U+2013>1667)|War for Ukraine]] (1654<U+2013>1667) ended with the [[Truce of Andrusovo|Treaty of Andrusovo]] of 13 January 1667. (Poland-Lithuania profited from [[Ottoman Empire|Turkish]] participation in the [[Russo-Turkish War (1676<U+2013>1681)]] due to Ottoman links with the [[Crimean Khanate|Crimea]].) The peace settlement gave Moscow control over the so called [[Left-bank Ukraine]] (left of the river [[Dnieper River|Dnieper]]), with the Commonwealth retaining [[Right-bank Ukraine]] (right of the Dnieper). While initially the agreement stipulated that Russia would return Left-bank Ukraine to the Commonwealth in twenty years, the division became permanent with the [[Eternal Peace Treaty of 1686]].

[[File:Territorial changes of Poland 1655.jpg|thumb|left|Poland-Lithuania during the Deluge]]

The Deluge brought to an end the era of Polish religious tolerance: mostly non-Catholic invaders antagonized the mostly [[Catholic]] Poles. The expulsion of the Protestant [[Polish Brethren]] from Poland in 1658 exemplified the increasing intolerance. During the Deluge, many thousands of [[History of the Jews in Poland|Polish Jews]] also fell victim to violence - violence often initiated by the [[Zaporozhian Cossacks]].<ref>
Such specifically anti-Jewish violence became known in the modern technical sense as a ''[[pogrom]]'' in the 19th century. For varying estimates of the numbers of Jews killed and for extensive sources, see [[Khmelnytsky Uprising#Casualties|the article on the Khmelnytsky Uprising]].

==In popular culture==

[[Henryk Sienkiewicz]] describes the Deluge in his novel [[The Deluge (novel)|''<U+0420><U+043E>t<U+043E><U+0440>'']] (1886).

[[James A. Michener|James Michener]] describes the Deluge in his novel [[Poland (novel)|''Poland'']] (1983).

[[Jerzy Hoffman]] directed the film [[The Deluge (film)|''The Deluge'']] (''<U+0420><U+043E>t<U+043E><U+0440>'') in 1974, a classic historical work based on Sienkiewicz's novel. It starred [[Daniel Olbrychski]] as the character [[Andrzej Kmicic]], a patriot who valiantly fought against the Swedish invasion. The film received a nomination for an [[Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film|Oscar]] in 1974, but lost to the [[Cinema of Italy|Italian film]] ''[[Amarcord]]''.

In the video game, [[Mount&Blade: With Fire & Sword]], there is a quest called "The Deluge", that is based on the actual events of the Deluge.
