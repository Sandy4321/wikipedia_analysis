'''Jimmy Reid''' (born 1932) is a [[Scotland|Scottish]] [[journalist]] and ex-[[trade union]] activist born in [[Govan]], [[Glasgow]].  He came to prominence in the early 1970s when he led the [[Upper Clyde Shipbuilders#Upper Clyde Shipbuilders Work-in|Upper Clyde Shipbuilders Work-in]] to try and stop [[Edward Heath|Edward Heath's]] [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] government from closing down the shipyards on the [[River Clyde]]. An engineer by trade, and a union official, Reid, along with his colleagues [[Jimmy Airlie]] and [[Sammy Barr]], decided that the best way to show the viability of keeping the yards open was by staging a 'work-in' rather than by going on strike. The campaign was successful in persuading Heath to back down.

Reid was at this stage a member of the [[Communist Party of Great Britain]], and was a councillor in [[Clydebank]].  He also received the most recent respectable number of votes for any [[communist]] candidate for a [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]] seat when he polled over 6,000 votes in the [[Dunbartonshire (UK Parliament constituency)|Dunbartonshire Central]] constituency in [[United Kingdom general election, February 1974|February 1974]] against [[Hugh McCartney]]. Reid's experiences as a committed Communist were expressed in his 1976 memoir, ''Jimmy Reid: Reflections of a Clyde-built Man''. 

Reid also served as [[Rector of the University of Glasgow]], being elected in 1971, largely on the back of his union activities.

He later moderated his political position and joined the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]], and was a candidate for them in [[Dundee East (UK Parliament constituency)|Dundee East]] in [[United Kingdom general election, 1979|1979]], but lost against the then [[Scottish National Party]] (SNP) leader [[Gordon Wilson (Scottish politician)|Gordon Wilson]].

Reid became a journalist, writing opinion columns for various newspapers, including ''[[The Daily Mirror]]'', ''[[The Herald (Glasgow)|The Herald]]'', ''[[The Sun (newspaper)|The Sun]]'' and ''[[The Scotsman]]''. He also presented a chat-show for [[Grampian Television]]. In [[2000]] he helped establish the ''[[Scottish Left Review]]'', a bi-monthly publication.

Reid continued to support Labour up until the [[United Kingdom general election, 1997|1997 General Election]], but thereafter became disillusioned with the [[New Labour]] phenomenon, and has since urged people to support either the SNP or the [[Scottish Socialist Party]] (SSP).

In the 2004 SNP leadership contest he urged SNP members to support [[Alex Salmond]] for leader and [[Nicola Sturgeon]] for deputy leader.

On 21 April 2005, Jimmy Reid announced he had joined the SNP.
