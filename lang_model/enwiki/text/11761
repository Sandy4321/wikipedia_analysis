'''Jaunpils Castle''' ({{lang-de|Schlo<U+00DF> Neuenburg}}) is a castle in the historical region of [[Zemgale]], in [[Latvia]]. More of a manor house than properly a fortified castle, it has now been converted into a hotel.<ref name="Turnbull2004">{{cite book|author=Stephen Turnbull|title=Crusader Castles of the Teutonic Knights (2): The stone castles of Latvia and Estonia 1185-1560|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=F3wzkSHR4j4C&pg=PA57|publisher=Osprey Publishing|isbn=978-1-84176-712-3|pages=60<U+2013>}}</ref>

== History ==
The castle was erected in 1301 by the Master of the German branch of the [[Livonian Order]], Gottfried von Roga.<ref name="Latvia Travel">{{cite web|last=Latvia Travel|title=Jaunpils Castle|url=http://www.latvia.travel/en/jaunpils-castle|publisher=Latvia Travel|accessdate=15 August 2012}}</ref> The tower was added in the 15th century. The castle was heavily damaged in war by [[Sweden|Swedes]] in 1625.<ref name=LPMA>{{cite web|last=Latvijas Pi<U+013C>u un Mui<U+017E>u asoci<U+0101>cija|title=Jaunpils Castle - Museum|url=http://www.pilis.lv/tulk/view.php?id=755&prop_id=255|publisher=Latvijas Pi<U+013C>u un Mui<U+017E>u asoci<U+0101>cija|accessdate=15 August 2012}}</ref> Later a third floor was added and the old fortress became a manor with all conveniences in the end of the 17th century. The building was partly reconstructed in 18th century. The castle was burned down during the [[Russian Revolution of 1905]]. A year later it was rebuilt by architect [[Wilhelm Bockslaff]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Zar<U+0101>ns|first=Alberts|title=Latvijas pilis un mui<U+017E>as.

From the 16th century until 1920 the castle belonged to the family of the [[Baltic German]] [[baron]] von der Recke. One of the family members who lived there in the 18th century was the poet [[Elisa von der Recke]].<ref name=LPMA/> After the Latvian agrarian reforms of 1920s, the castle complex housed a [[Cattle breeding|cattle-breeding]] experimental station. During the [[Soviet occupation of Latvia]], the interior of the castle was heavily reconstructed and today Jaunpils castle has typical Soviet interiors from the 1960s.<ref>{{cite book|last=Krahe|first=Friedrich-Wilhelm|title=Burgen des deutschen Mittelalters.
