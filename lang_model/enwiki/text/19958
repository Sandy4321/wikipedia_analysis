Blank has a background in gymnastics and cheerleading. She studied [[broadcast journalism]], hoping to become a television anchor, and worked as a model for [[Venus Swimwear]] and [[Hawaiian Tropic]]. In 2006, Blank was signed to a contract by WWE and sent to [[Ohio Valley Wrestling]], a WWE [[Farm team#Professional wrestling|developmental territory]]. She debuted on the [[ECW (WWE)|ECW]] brand in June 2006 as 'Kelly Kelly', with the [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Gimmick|character]] of an exhibitionist and performing a striptease. She continued her stripteases, in a segment known as ''Kelly's Expos<U+00E9>'', weekly on ''ECW'', and also became the [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Valet|valet]] of her on-screen boyfriend [[Mike Knox]]. The following year, she formed Extreme Expos<U+00E9> with [[Layla El|Layla]] and [[Brooke Adams (model)|Brooke Adams]], and the trio performed a regular dance segment on ''ECW''. They later became involved in a storyline with [[Mike Mizanin|The Miz]], which led to the dissolution of the group.

Kelly then began participating in more wrestling matches, and was moved to the ''[[WWE Raw|Raw]]'' brand in July 2008. Throughout the next year, she unsuccessfully challenged for the [[WWE Divas Championship]] on several occasions, before moving to ''[[WWE SmackDown|SmackDown!]]'' in early 2010. There she challenged [[Lay-Cool]] for the [[WWE Women's Championship]], but was unsuccessful. In 2011, Kelly moved back to ''[[WWE Raw|Raw]]'', where she captured her first Divas Championship.<ref>http://www.lordsofpain.net/reports/wwe/raw/LIVE_COVERAGE_OF_TONIGHT_S_WWE_RAW_6_20_11.html</ref>
