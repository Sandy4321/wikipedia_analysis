'''Hippocrates of Cos II.''' or '''Hippokrates of Kos''' (c. [[460 BC]]&ndash;c. [[370 BC]], [[Greek language|Greek]]: {{polytonic|'''<U+0399><U+03C0><U+03C0><U+03BF><U+03BA><U+03C1><U+03AC><U+03C4><U+03B7><U+03C2>'''}}) was an [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greek]] [[physician]] who lived in the [[Age of Pericles]] and is commonly regarded as one of the most outstanding figures in the history of [[medicine]]. For his lasting contributions to this field, he is  often referred to as "[[List of people known as the father or mother of something|The Father of Medicine]]". The Hippocratic school defined the field of medicine as separate from the other disciplines (notably [[theurgy]] and [[philosophy]]) and made a profession of practicing medicine. It summed up the medical knowledge of previous schools and defined [[moral code]]s and practices for [[physician]]s by which to work and live.<ref> {{Harvnb|Garrison|1966|p=92-93}} </ref><ref name=nuland5> {{Harvnb|Nuland|1988|p=5}} </ref>

The '''Hippocratic Corpus''', the collection of works commonly associated with Hippocrates, was the medium through which Hippocratic philosophy proffered the above and is largely responsible for his renown today; its achievements and the achievements of Hippocrates' followers are inseparable from his individual ones. The Corpus also represented extraordinary skills of clinical observation in clear, concise, objective writing.<ref name=marti86> {{Harvnb|Mart<U+00ED>-Ib<U+00E1><U+00F1>ez|1961|p=86-87}}</ref> The great detail and depth of the descriptions in these historic works are still respected, as is the [[Hippocratic Oath]], which is sometimes taken today in modified form.<ref name=gar94> {{Harvnb|Garrison|1966|p=94}} </ref><ref> {{Harvnb|Garrison|1966|p=96}} </ref>

==Biography==
[[Image:Asklepion414.jpg|thumb|right|200px|''Askleipion'' on the Greek island of [[Kos]]]]
Only Hippocrates' approximate birth date, birth place and profession are known for certain. Historians accept that he actually existed, was born near the year 460 BC on the island of [[Kos]] and that he was a famous physician and teacher of medicine. All other biographical information is possibly apocryphal (''See [[Hippocrates#Legends|Legends]]''). It is now difficult to separate these from the fact of what actually happened. As no real biography was available until centuries after his death, those that are available today must be based on many years of oral tradition and are thus unreliable.<ref name=nuland4> {{Harvnb|Nuland|1988|p=4}} </ref>

[[Soranus of Ephesus]], about whom little is known, was Hippocrates's first biographer and is the source of most information on Hippocrates's person. Soranus stated <!--in his work ''The Life of Hippocrates'' question mark-->that Hippocrates's father, a [[physician]], was Heraclides, and his mother, daughter of [[Phenaretis]], was named Praxitela. He had two sons, Thessalus and Draco, and a son-in-law, Polybus. All three were his students, but [[Galen]] says that Polybus was Hippocrates<U+2019> true successor. Galen also states that Thessalus and Draco each had a son named Hippocrates.<ref name=adams19> {{Harvnb|Adams|1891|p=19}} </ref><ref name=mar66> {{Harvnb|Margotta|1968|p=66}} </ref>

Soranus says also that Hippocrates was taught medicine by his father and grandfather, while other subjects were taught by [[Democritus]] and [[Gorgias]]. He could have been trained at the [[Healing temple|Asklepieion]] of [[Kos]], and may have been a pupil of [[Herodicus|Herodicus of Selymbria]]: [[Plato]], Hippocrates' only contemporary to mention him, describes him as an [[Asclepiad (Greek)|Asclepiad]].  <ref name=marti86> {{Harvnb|Mart<U+00ED>-Ib<U+00E1><U+00F1>ez|1961|p=86-87}} </ref> Other ancient biographers of his were [[Suidas]], [[Tzetzes]], and [[Aristotle]].<ref> {{Harvnb|Garrison|1966|p=92}} </ref><ref name=nuland7> {{Harvnb|Nuland|1988|p=7}} </ref>
<!--
Ancient Greeks held that Hippocrates was descended from Aesclipius adams7?-->

It is fairly certain that Hippocrates traveled significantly, at least as far as [[Thessaly]], [[Thrace]], and the [[Sea of Marmara]], practicing medicine whenever he went.<ref name=mar66 /> He may have died in [[Larissa]] at the age of 83 or 90, though his death date is speculated with very little certainty; some sources state that he lived to be over 100 years old. <ref name=mar66 />

==Hippocratic theory==
===Cause of illness===
Hippocrates is often hailed as the first physician to reject superstitious beliefs sucessfully and practice medicine based only on scientific theory. While in some respects he did just this, Hippocrates also had a few pseudo-scientific convictions about the human body and the cause of illnesses. <ref name=garrison9394> {{Harvnb|Garrison|1966|p=93-4}} </ref>

Indeed, Greek medicine of the time knew almost nothing of human [[anatomy]] and [[physiology]], largely because of the Greek taboo prohibiting the dissection of animals. The [[Knidos|Knidian]] school, focused towards diagnosis, was dependent upon faulty assumptions about the human body; it failed to distinguish when one disease caused many possible series of symptoms. <ref name=adams15> {{Harvnb|Adam|1891|p=15}} </ref> The Hippocratic school of Kos, however, was more successful because it was more general in its diagnoses and more passive in its treatment. So, the focus of Hippocratic medicine was on patient care, prognosis and not diagnostics, and could not effectively treat many diseases, yet it also allowed for a great development in clinical practice.<ref name=margotta67> {{Harvnb|Margotta|1968|p=67}} </ref><ref> {{Harvnb|Leff|Leff|1956|p=51}} </ref>

Hippocrates did deny the divine origin of all sickness. He hypothesized that disease was not punishment of the [[Greek gods|gods]] but due to environmental factors, diet and living habits. Indeed, there is not a single mention of mystical illness in the entirety of the Hippocratic Corpus. <ref name=jones11> {{Harvnb|Jones|1868|p=11}}</ref><ref name=nuland8> {{Harvnb|Nuland|1988|p=8-9}} </ref>

====Humorism====
{{mainarticle|Humorism}}
Hippocrates held that illness was due to an imbalance of the [[four humours]] in the body, fluids which were naturally equal in proportion (''pepsis'').<ref name=garrison99> {{Harvnb|Garrison|1966|p=99}} </ref> When the four humours, [[blood]], [[black bile]], [[yellow bile]] and [[phlegm]] were unbalanced ("dyscrasia", meaning "bad mixture"), a person became sick and would remain that way until the balance was restored. Hippocratic therapy was directed towards this end. [[Citrus]], for instance, might be prescribed if the attending physician thought there might be an abundance of phlem.<ref name=boylan> {{Harvnb|Boylan|2006}} </ref>

===Diagnosis===
Hippocrates and his followers identified many diseases and medical conditions for the first time. He also began to categorize illnesses as acute, chronic, endemic and epidemic. Other medical terms that he introduced were, "exacerbation, relapse, resolution, crisis, paroxysm, peak, and convalescence."<ref name=gar97> {{Harvnb|Garrison|1966|p=97}}</ref><ref name=mart90> {{Harvnb|Mart<U+00ED>-Ib<U+00E1><U+00F1>ez|1961|p=90}} </ref>

One significant contribution of Hippocrates is in his description of the [[symptomology]], physical findings, surgical treatment and prognosis of [[thoracic empyema]], i.e. [[suppuration]] of the lining of the chest cavity. Much of what he said is very useful to students of pulmonary medicine and surgery today.<ref name=major> {{Harvnb|Major|1965}} </ref><!-- find page-->

===Prognosis===
One of the strengths of Hippocratic medicine was in its predictions of the course that a disease would take, or its [[prognosis]]. At this time, medicinal therapy was immature, and the best that much of what physicians could do was evaluate an illness and induce the likely progression of it. These predictions were based upon data collected in detailed case histories and were quite valuable.<ref name=garrison9394 /><ref name=garrison97> {{Harvnb|Garrison|1966|p=97}} </ref>

====Crisis====
[[Image:Greek_kneewrapping.jpg|thumb|200px|An ancient Greek treatment of a [[thigh]] injury. Use of a complex bandage can be seen.]]
An important concept in Hippocratic medicine was that of a ''crisis'', a point in the progression of disease at which either the illness would begin triumph and the patient would move to die, or the opposite, and natural processes would make the patient recover. After a crisis, a relapse might follow, and then another deciding crisis. Crises occur on ''critical days'', which are usually a fixed time after the contraction of the disease.<ref name=jones46> {{Harvnb|Jones|1868|p=46}} </ref><!-- the idea of crises came from the patterns found in predecessors' case histories-->

===Therapy===
Another important precept of Hippocratic doctrine was based on, "the healing power of nature", or in [[Latin]], ''vis medicatrix naturae''; according to this doctrine, the body contains within itself the power to rebalance the four humours and thus get better (''physis'').<ref name=garrison99> {{Harvnb|Garrison|1966|p=99}} </ref> Hippocratic therapy was focused on simply easing this natural process. To this end, patient was often made to relax and recuperate on his own. According to Hippocrates, "rest and immobilization are of capital importance".<ref name=margotta73> {{Harvnb|Margotta|1968|p=73}} </ref> By these beliefs, he was reluctant to administer drugs and engage in specialized treatment that could be wrong; generalized therapy followed a generalized diagnosis.<ref name=gar98> {{Harvnb|Garrison|1966|p=98}} </ref><ref name=sing35> {{Harvnb|Singer|Underwood|1962|p=35}} </ref><!--gymnastics?-->

==Hippocratic practice==
===Professionalism===<!-- expand-->
For all of his advancements in medical theory, it was truly in discipline, practice, and strict professionalism that Hippocratic medicine excelled. In the Hippocratic work ''On the physician'', it is recommended that physicians must always be well-kempt, honest, calm, understanding and serious.<ref name=margotta64> {{Harvnb|Margotta|1968|p=64}} </ref>

The Hippocratic School is famous for its clinical doctrines. These recommend that physicians record their findings and their medicinal methods in a very clear and objective manner, so that these records may be passed down and employed by other physicians.<ref name=margotta66> {{Harvnb|Margotta|1968|p=66}} </ref> He also extended clinical observations into family history and environment in accordance with his theory.<ref name=margotta68> {{Harvnb|Margotta|1968|p=68}} </ref> "To him medicine owes the art of clinical inspection and observation"<ref name=gar94 /> For this reason, he may termed only the "Father of ''Clinical'' Medicine". <ref> {{Harvnb|Leff|Leff|1956|p=45}} </ref>

Hippocrates made careful, regular note of many symptoms including complexion, pulse, fever, pains, movement, and excretions. <ref name=gar97 /> He might have even measured a patient's pulse when taking a [[case history]] in order to know if the patient lied. <ref name=marti88> {{Harvnb|Mart<U+00ED>-Ib<U+00E1><U+00F1>ez|1961|p=88}} </ref>

===Methods of treatment===
[[Image:Ancientgreek surgical.jpg|thumb|250px|A number of ancient Greek surgical tools. On the left is a [[trephine]]; on the right, a set of [[scalpel]]s. Hippocratic medicine made good use of these tools. <ref name=adams17> {{Harvnb|Adam|1891|p=17}} </ref>]]
In accordance with the focus on patient care, Hippocratic medicine was very kind to the patient, sterile and gentle whenever possible. For example, only clean water or wine was used on wounds, though "dry" treatment was preferable. Specifications for, "lighting, personnel, instruments, positioning of the patient, and techniques of bandaging and splinting" in the ancient [[operating room]] are described in detail.<ref name=gar98> {{Harvnb|Garrison|1966|p=98}} </ref><ref name=rutkow24> {{Harvnb|Rutkow|p=24-5}} </ref>
<!--Soothing balms were often used, for instance. Also, the Hippocratic writings introduced the policy of patient [[confidentiality]], a practice still in use today. {{fact}}-->
<!--

==The Hippocratic Corpus==
{{mainarticle|List of works in the Hippocratic Corpus}}
The Hippocratic Corpus (Latin: ''Corpus Hippocratum'') is a collection of around seventy early medical works from ancient Greece strongly associated with Hippocrates and his teachings. Of the seventy-or-so volumes in the Corpus, none is proven to be of Hippocrates' hand itself, though some sources say otherwise.<ref name=singer27> {{Harvnb|Singer|Underwood|1962|p=27}} </ref>Instead, the works were probably produced by students and followers of his, maybe centuries after he died. But the corpus carries Hippocrates' name as it was attributed to him in antiquity and its teaching generally follow principles of his. Because of the variety of subjects, writing styles and apparent date of construction, scholars believe it could not have been written by one person and may be the remains of a library of Kos, or a collection compiled in the third century B.C. in [[Alexandria]].<ref name=margotta64 /><ref name=marti86> {{Harvnb|Mart<U+00ED>-Ib<U+00E1><U+00F1>ez|1961|p=86-87}}</ref>

===Content===
The Hippocratic Corpus contains textbooks, lectures, research, notes and even philosophical essays on various subjects in medicine in no particular order.<ref name=singer27 /><ref name=rutkow23> {{Harvnb|Rutkow|p=23}} </ref> These works were also written for different audiences, both specialists and laymen. They were also sometimes written from opposing view points, and significant contradictions can be found between works in the Corpus.<ref name=sing28> {{Harvnb|Singer|Underwood|1962|p=28}} </ref>

There are a number of case-histories in the Hippocratic Corpus, 42 to be exact. Of these, 60% (25)  ended in the patient's death. <ref name=gar95> {{Harvnb|Garrison|1966|p=95}} </ref> Nearly all of the diseases described in the Corpus are [[endemic disease]]s: colds, consumption, pneumonia, etc.<ref name=jones51> {{Harvnb|Jones|1868|p=51}} </ref>

===Style===
{{Quote_box|
 width=30%
|align=right
|quote="Life is short, [the] art long, opportunity fleeting, experiment treacherous, judgment difficult."
|source= ''Aphorisms'' i.1.
}}
The concise and objective writing style of the Corpus has been remarked upon for centuries, being described by some as, "clear, precise, and simple"<ref name=gar99> {{Harvnb|Garrison|1966|p=99}} </ref> and, "grave and austere" by others.<ref name=jones10> {{Harvnb|Jones|1868|p=10}} </ref> [[Francis Adams (translator)|Francis Adams]] goes one step further and calls it sometimes <U+201C>obscure<U+201D>. Not all of the Hippocratic corpus is of this <U+201C>laconic<U+201D> style, but most is. His style has been compared to that of [[Thucydides]], who also is concise, sometimes too much.<ref name=adams18> {{Harvnb|Adam|1891|p=18}} </ref>

The whole corpus is written in [[Ionic dialect|Ionic Greek]], though the island of Kos was in a region that spoke [[Doric Greek]]. The use of Ionic instead of the native Doric dialect is analogous to the practice of [[Renaissance]] scientists, using [[Latin]] instead of the vernacular for their treatises. <ref name=jones23> {{Harvnb|Jones|1868|p=23}} </ref>

===Printed editions===
The entire Hippocratic Corpus was first printed as a unit in 1525 in [[Latin]] edited by [[Fabius Calvus]] in [[Rome]]. The first complete [[Greek language|Greek]] edition followed the next year in [[Venice]], and the [[English language|English]] version was published about 300 years later.<ref name=rutkow23> {{Harvnb|Rutkow|p=23}} </ref>

A significant edition was that of [[<U+00C9>mile Littr<U+00E9>]] who spent twenty-two years (1839-1861) working diligently on the Hippocratic Corpus. This was scholarly, yet sometimes inaccurate and awkward. Another edition of note was that of [[Ermerins]], whose notes were, "a pleasure to read", according to [[W. H. S. Jones]].<ref name=jones6263> {{Harvnb|Jones|1868|p=62-3}} </ref>

===The Oath===
{{mainarticle|Hippocratic Oath}}
The most famous work in it is the [[Hippocratic Oath]], a landmark declaration of doctoral ethics historically taken at the beginning of a doctor's career. While the oath is rarely used in its original form, derivatives of it are taken today and it serves as a foundation for other, similar oaths and laws that define good medical practice and morals. <ref name=jones217> {{Harvnb|Jones|1868|p=217}} </ref>

==Legacy==
[[Image:Kos Platane1.jpg|thumb|The [[Plane Tree of Hippocrates]], under which Hippocrates is said to have worked.]]
Hippocrates was the first great physician, and for a long time, the last. He was the most important influence on medicine for over a thousand years, and after him there was a dearth of medical advancement.<ref>{{Harvnb|Garrison|1966|p=100}}</ref> According to [[Aristotle]]'s testimony, he was known as "the Great Hippocrates"<ref name=jones38> {{Harvnb|Jones|1868|p=38}} </ref>. Medical practitioners who followed him sometimes moved backwards. For instance, "after the Hippocratic period, the practice of taking clinical case-histories died out..."<ref name=gar95> {{Harvnb|Garrison|1966|p=95}}</ref>

After Hippocrates, the next significant physician was [[Galen]], a [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] who lived from 129 -200 AD. Galen perpetuated Hippocratic medicine, though controversially. In the [[Middle Ages]], [[Arab]]s, too, adopted Hippocratic methods.<ref> {{Harvnb|Leff|Leff|1956|p=102}} </ref> After the [[European Renaissance]], Hippocratic methods were revived in Europe and even further expanded upon in the 1800s. Others that employed Hippocrates' rigorous clinical techniques were [[Sydenham]], [[Heberden]],  [[Charcot]] and [[Olser]]. It has been said that these revivals make up "the whole history of internal medicine".<ref name=gar94 />

And yet, Hippocratic medicine is far removed from modern medicine. Today, the physician focuses on specific diagnosis and specialized treatment. So Hippocratic methods have seen some serious criticism in the past two millenia. [[M. S. Houdart]] in 1836 called Hippocratic treatment a "meditation upon death." He said the purpose of the doctor was to cure the patient, not simply predict how he will die.<ref name=jones1213> {{Harvnb|Jones|1868|p=12-3}} </ref>

===Image===
So revered was Hippocrates at the time of his death that [[honey]] (from a [[beehive]]) on his grave was believed to have healing powers. But so revered was he, that, after him, no significant advancements were made for a long time. His teachings were taken as too great to be improved upon. <ref name=marti86> {{Harvnb|Mart<U+00ED>-Ib<U+00E1><U+00F1>ez|1961|p=86-87}}</ref><ref> {{Harvnb|Margotta|1968|p=73}} </ref>

Concerning his disposition, Hippocrates was first portrayed as a, "kind, dignified, old 'country doctor'" and later as, "stern and forbidding".<ref name=marti86 /> He is certainly considered wise and of very great intellect. He is seen as very ''practical'', and Adams describes him as "strictly the physician of experience and common sense". <ref name=adams15> {{Harvnb|Adam|1891|p=15}} </ref>

His image as the wise, old doctor is reinforced by our busts of him, which all wear large beards<!--lined faces-->. The image is probably close, though: the physicians of the time wore their hair in the style of [[Jove]] and [[Asclepius]]. But, the busts of Hippocrates that we have today are probably only altered versions of portraits of these deities.<ref name=gar100> {{Harvnb|Garrison|1966|p=100}} </ref>
<!-- best bust uffizi gallery-->

He, and the beliefs that he embodied, are considered medical ideals. "He is, above all, the exemplar of that flexible, critical, well-poised attitude of mind, ever on the lookout for sources of error, which is the very essence of the scientific spirit."<ref name=gar94 /> "His figure... stands for all time as that of the ideal physician<U+201D>,  inspiring the medical profession since his death.<ref name=sing29> {{Harvnb|Singer|Underwood|1962|p=29}} </ref>

===Legends===
Some events that, said to have taken place are unlikely to have actually occurred. For example, Hippocrates was supposed to have aided in the healing of Athenians during the [[Plague of Athens]] by lighting great fires as "disinfectants". This account, is not corraborated by any historians.<ref name=jones37> {{Harvnb|Jones|1868|p=37}} </ref><ref name=adams11> {{Harvnb|Adams|1891|p=11}} </ref>

There is a story of Hippocrates curing [[Perdiccas]], a [[Macedonia|Macedonian]] king of "[[love sickness]]". While the story itself probably did not occur, Hippocrates likely attended Perdiccas' court.<ref name=adams10> {{Harvnb|Adams|1891|p=10}} </ref>

Another legend, this one negative, was that Hippocrates did his traveling only after he set fire to a [[healing temple]] in Greece. Soranus, the source of this story, names the temple as the one of [[Knidos]]. Tzetzes writes, however, that it was his own Temple of Cos that was burned, that he would maintain a monopoly of medical knowledge.<ref name=adams10> {{Harvnb|Adams|1891|p=10}} </ref>

One more probable legend concerns how Hippocrates rejected a formal request to visit the court of the [[King of Persia]]. The validity of this is accepted by ancient sources, denied by some modern ones and is thus under contention.<ref name=adams1213> {{Harvnb|Adams|1891|p=12-3}} </ref>

According to legend, [[Democritus]] was supposed to be mad because he laughed at everything, and so he was sent to Hippocrates to be cured. Hippocrates diagnosed him with merely a happy disposition. Democritus has since been called "the laughing philosopher".

====Genealogy====
With this legendary figure, comes a legendary genealogy, which traces Hippocrates<U+2019> heritage directly to Asclepius. The [[ahnentafel]] of Hippocrates II. is, according to [[John Tzetzes]]<U+2019>s ''[[Chiliades]]'':
