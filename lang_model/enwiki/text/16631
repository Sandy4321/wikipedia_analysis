===Preseason watchlists===
On August 19, 2009, the [[John R. Wooden Award|Wooden Award]] preseason watch list included eight Big Ten players. The watchlist was composed of 50 players who were not transfers, freshmen or medical [[redshirt (college sports)|redshirts]].  The list will be reduced to a 30-player mid-season watchlist in December and a final national ballot of about 20 players in March.<ref name=VNtWAW/> On October 29, the [[Naismith College Player of the Year]] watchlist of 50 players was announced.  In late February, a shorter list of the Top 30 was compiled in preparation for a March vote to narrow the list to the four finalists.<ref name=NT2PWLDWU/>
