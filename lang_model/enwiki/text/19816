An '''electronic musical instrument''' is a [[musical instrument]] that produces its sounds using [[electronics]]. In contrast, the term [[electric instrument]] is used to mean instruments whose sound is produced mechanically, and only amplified or altered electronically - for example an [[electric guitar]]. Usually the instrument will have some way of controlling the sound, such as by adjusting the [[pitch (music)|pitch]], [[frequency]], or duration of each [[note]].

All electric and electronic musical instruments can be viewed as a subset of [[audio signal processing]] applications. Simple electronic musical instruments are sometimes called [[sound effect]]s; the border between sound effects and actual musical instruments is often hazy.

French [[composer]] and engineer [[Edgard Var<U+00E8>se]] created a variety of compositions using electronic horns, whistles, and tape. Most notably, he wrote [[Po<U+00E8>me <U+00E9>lectronique|Po<U+00E8>me <U+00C9>lectronique]] for the Phillips pavilion at the [[Expo '58|Brussels World Fair]] in [[1958]]. 

Electronic musical instruments are now widely used in most styles of music. The development of new electronic musical instruments continues to be a highly active and interdisciplinary field of research. Specialized conferences, notably the International Conference on [[New interfaces for musical expression]], have organized to report cutting edge work, as well as to provide a showcase for artists who perform or create music with new electronic music instruments. 

== Early electronic musical instruments ==
In the broadest sense, the very first electrified musical instrument was the [[Denis d'or]], dating from [[1753]]. It was followed by the [[Clavecin <U+00E9>lectrique]] by the Frenchman Jean-Baptiste de Laborde in [[1761]].

The first purely electronic musical instrument was the [[Telharmonium]], built by [[Thaddeus Cahill]] in [[1906]]. Employing electric generators and tonewheels to produce notes, it had a length of 60ft and a weight of 200 tons; because of a lack of suitable loudspeakers at that time, the music was distributed over the telephone network.

One of the many instruments constructed in the following decades was the [[Theremin]], invented by [[L<U+00E9>on Theremin|Leon Theremin]] in 1917, which used a pair of heterodyned vacuum tube RF oscillators to make an audible tone that varied in pitch depending on the distance, and thus the capacitance, between the user and the instrument. This was followed in 1928 by the [[Ondes Martenot]] which had a keyboard as well as several auxiliary controllers.

The sound of the Ondes Martenot is used extensively in the ''[[Turangal<U+00EE>la-Symphonie]]'' and other works by [[Olivier Messiaen]].  However, these were not true synthesizers in the modern sense, as they were not configurable to produce a range of complex sounds by additive or subtractive synthesis, instead generating single pure tones with controllable [[pitch (music)|pitch]], [[amplitude]] and [[vibrato]].

Ca. 1929 [[Friedrich Trautwein]] invented the [[Trautonium]] in Berlin. It was played with a resistor wire which has to be pressed against a metal plate. [[Oskar Sala]] was one of the first players and continued development until his death in 2002. [[Paul Hindemith]] wrote some compositions for it.

These early electronic instruments produced only pure tones and were frequently used to make [[avant garde music]]. In April [[1935]],  Laurens Hammond introduced the [[Hammond Organ|Hammond tonewheel organ]], which generated complex tones using an electro-mechanical principle derived from the design of the [[Telharmonium]]. Later Hammond used the [[Leslie speaker]] to achieve special modulation effects, and the resulting [[Hammond organ]] sound is still regarded as the benchmark for the "electric organ" sound. This sound can be simulated by many modern synthesizers and digital samplers.

==Synthesizers==
The most commonly used electronic instruments are [[synthesizer]]s, so-called because they artificially generate sound using techniques such as [[additive synthesis|additive]], [[subtractive synthesis|subtractive]], [[FM synthesis|FM]] and [[physical modelling synthesis]] to create sounds.

Dr. [[Robert Moog]] introduced the first practical commercial modern music [[synthesizer]] with his [[Moog synthesizer]]. This instrument used a series of tone generators with keys that would adjust the tone generators' pitch. Moog resolved to sell [[Theremin]]s to gain enough money to engineer this synthesizer. 

The first [[digital synthesizer]]s were academic experiments in sound synthesis using digital computers. [[FM synthesis]] was developed for this purpose, as a way of generating complex sounds digitally with the smallest number of computational operations per sound sample.

== Modern electronic musical instruments ==

While [[synthesizer]]s dominate the current market, other instruments such as the [[radiodrum]] are being developed by people such as [[Peter Driessen]] and [[Andrew Schloss]] as an alternative to the standard user interfaces of traditional instruments.  These modern electronic instruments seek to improve the musician's ability to express music, rather than experimenting with tone which can then be done by [[synthesizer]]s.
