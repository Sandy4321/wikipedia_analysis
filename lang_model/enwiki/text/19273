[[Air Vice Marshal (Australia)|Air Vice Marshal]] '''William Lloyd (Bill) Hely''' [[Order of the Bath|CB]], [[Order of the British Empire|CBE]], [[Air Force Cross (United Kingdom)|AFC]] (24 August 1909&nbsp;<U+2013> 20&nbsp;May 1970) was a senior commander in the [[Royal Australian Air Force]] (RAAF). He graduated from the [[Royal Military College, Duntroon]], in 1930 before transferring to the RAAF as a cadet pilot. Hely came to public attention in 1936<U+2013>37, first when he crashed on a survey flight in the Northern Territory, and later when he undertook two successful missions to locate missing aircraft in the same vicinity. His rescue efforts earned him the [[Air Force Cross (United Kingdom)|Air Force Cross]]. After occupying staff positions during the early years of [[Military history of Australia during World War II|World War&nbsp;II]], Hely was appointed Officer Commanding [[No. 72 Wing RAAF|No.&nbsp;72 Wing]] in [[Netherlands New Guinea|Dutch New Guinea]] in May 1944. Later that year he formed [[No. 84 Wing RAAF|No.&nbsp;84 (Army Cooperation) Wing]], commanding it during the [[Bougainville Campaign]] until the end of the Pacific War.

Hely spent the immediate post-war period on the staff of RAAF Headquarters, [[Melbourne]]. From 1951 to 1953 he served as [[Air Officer Commanding]] (AOC) Western Area Command in [[Perth, Western Australia|Perth]], after which he was appointed a [[Commander of the Order of the British Empire]].  He was [[Deputy Chief of Air Force (Australia)|Deputy Chief of the Air Staff]] from 1953 to 1956, AOC [[Air Force Training Group RAAF|Training Command]] from 1956 to 1957, and Head of the Australian Joint Services Staff in Washington,&nbsp;D.C. from 1957 to 1960. He then served as Air Member for Personnel (AMP) for six years, his tenure coinciding with a significant increase in manpower to meet commitments in South East Asia and the demands of a major re-equipment program. Having been promoted acting [[air vice marshal]] in 1953 ([[Military rank#Types of rank|substantive]] in 1956), he was appointed a [[Companion of the Order of the Bath]] in 1964 for his service as AMP. He retired from the Air Force in 1966 and made his home in [[Canberra]], where he died in 1970 at the age of sixty.

In April 1936, Hely took command of No.&nbsp;3 Squadron's North Australia Survey Flight, one of two such [[Flight (military unit)|flights]] formed by the Air Force that month to carry out photographic surveys. Flying a twin-engined [[de Havilland Dragon Rapide]] (serial number A3-2), Hely departed Richmond on 11&nbsp;April for [[Port Hedland, Western Australia|Port Hedland]], which was to be the flight's base for its initial survey work in Western Australia.

For its 1937 aerial survey program, the RAAF formed the Communications and Survey Flight under [[No. 1 Aircraft Depot RAAF|No.&nbsp;1 Aircraft Depot]]'s Recruit Training Squadron at Laverton on 3&nbsp;May.  The flight was divided into Western and Eastern Air Detachments, the former under Hely. Flying a [[Tugan Gannet]], Hely's first task became searching for survey director Sir Herbert Gepp, whose Rapide (A3-2, the same one Hely crash landed the previous year) had gone missing on an inspection flight in the Northern Territory between [[Tennant Creek]] and [[Tanami Desert|Tanimi]]. Hely located the downed Rapide on 23&nbsp;May, guiding in a ground party that was able to clear a makeshift runway and allow Gepp and his team to take off and resume their journey.<ref>Coulthard-Clark, ''The Third Brother'', pp. 433<U+2013>435</ref> On 25&nbsp;September, Hely was again diverted from survey work to search for a lost plane, this time the [[de Havilland DH.60 Moth|de Havilland Gipsy Moth]] of [[Royal Flying Doctor Service of Australia|flying doctor]] [[Clyde Fenton]], who had gone missing north-east of Newcastle Waters. Hely, once more piloting Rapide A3-2, found the Moth three days later and landed to rescue the lost doctor. Fenton was subsequently quoted as saying "I have only the highest praise for the efficient manner in which Hely conducted a difficult search and the skilful way in which he located me and picked me up".<ref>Coulthard-Clark, ''The Third Brother'', pp. 436<U+2013>437</ref>  The rescue efforts made Hely one of the RAAF's best-known public figures.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article2445621 |title=Plane Crash |newspaper=[[The Canberra Times]] |location=Canberra|date=22 November 1937 |accessdate=on 28 May 2013 |page=2 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}</ref> Completing his posting to the survey flight, he served as [[adjutant]] at Laverton in 1938.<ref name="AVM"/> He was awarded the [[Air Force Cross (United Kingdom)|Air Force Cross]] on 9&nbsp;June for "zeal and initiative in searching for Sir Herbert Gepp's party and later for Dr. Fenton when lost in Central Australia".<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article95949100 |title=Seven knighthoods in eastern states |newspaper=The Recorder |location=Port Pirie, South Australia |date=9 June 1938 |accessdate=on 28 May 2013 |page=1 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}</ref><ref>{{LondonGazette|issue=  34518|supp=yes|startpage=3709|date=9 June 1938|accessdate=on 28 May 2013}}</ref> On 29&nbsp;November 1938, he married secretary Jean McDonald at St Aidan's Anglican Church in [[Launceston, Tasmania|Launceston]], Tasmania; the couple would have two daughters.

Hely became Air Member for Personnel (AMP) on 28&nbsp;March 1960, taking over from the acting AMP, Air Commodore [[Frank Headlam]].<ref name="AVM"/><ref name="Solo499"/> Responsible for the Personnel Branch of the RAAF, the position of AMP occupied a seat on the Air Board, the service's controlling body that comprised its senior officers and was chaired by the [[Chief of Air Force (Australia)|Chief of the Air Staff]] (CAS).<ref name="Solo88">Stephens, ''Going Solo'', pp. 88<U+2013>89</ref><ref>Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', p. 52</ref> The Air Force expanded greatly during Hely's term as AMP, owing to Australia's increasing commitment to the security of South East Asia, and the most significant rearmament program the RAAF had undertaken outside of World War&nbsp;II. Its permanent establishment increased from a steady 15,000 or so in the 1950s to over 18,000 by 1966.<ref name="Solo88"/><ref>Stephens, ''Going Solo'', p. 501</ref> Hely himself initiated a scheme to attract staff from the [[Royal Air Force]], which was suffering cutbacks, by opening a recruitment office in London and taking advantage of the Australian government's [[Ten Pound Poms|assisted passage scheme]] to import trained personnel and their families.<ref name="Solo88"/> He was appointed a [[Companion of the Order of the Bath]] (CB) in the 1964 [[New Year Honours]] for his "tactful and careful handling of personnel matters", and for having "done much to improve the manning level of the Air Force".<ref>{{LondonGazette|issue=43201|supp=yes|startpage=35|date=1 January 1964|accessdate=on 28 May 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|work=RAAF News, Vol. 6, No. 1|title=Nineteen in honours list|date= January<U+2013>February 1964|page= p. 7}}</ref> As AMP, Hely put forward proposals to increase the number of [[diploma]]-qualified engineering and equipment officers in the Air Force.<ref>Coulthard-Clark, ''From the Ground Up'', pp. 109<U+2013>113</ref> He was also closely involved in deliberations concerning the balance of academic and military studies at the RAAF Academy (previously RAAF College), the outcome of which is considered to have left the course biased towards pure science, rather than its applications to air power.<ref>Frost, ''RAAF College & Academy'', pp. 49<U+2013>52</ref><ref>Stephens, ''The Royal Australian Air Force'', pp. 188<U+2013>189</ref>
