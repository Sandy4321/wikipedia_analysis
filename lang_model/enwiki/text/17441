'''Switchfoot''' is an American [[alternative rock]] band from [[San Diego, California|San Diego]], [[California]]. The band's members are [[Jon Foreman]] ([[lead vocals|vocals]], [[guitar]]), [[Tim Foreman]] ([[bass guitar]], [[backing vocalist|backing vocals]]), [[Chad Butler]] ([[drum kit|drums]], [[percussion instrument|percussion]]), [[Jerome Fontamillas]] (guitar, [[keyboard instrument|keyboards]], backing vocals), and [[Drew Shirley]] (guitar). Known for their energetic live shows<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.luminomagazine.com/mw/content/view/1514/4/ |title=Switch nothing - Foot does just fine |date=2006-11-15 |accessdate=2007-01-15}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.unratedmagazine.com/Document.cfm?Page=Articles/index.cfm&Article_ID=410 |title=Switchfoot's New Stance |date=2006-10-25 |accessdate=2007-01-15}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://skateboard.about.com/od/dewactionsportstournews/ss/DASTJournal05_7.htm |title=Switchfoot Concert |accessdate=2007-01-15}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.abc.net.au/goldcoast/stories/s1474915.htm |title=Switchfoot - Nothing is Sound tour |publisher=[[Australian Broadcasting Corporation|ABC]] |date=2005-10-03 |accessdate=2007-01-15}}</ref>, the three guitarists in the line-up often operate simultaneously, building on the [[Pop music|pop]] sensibilities of Jon's songwriting, and, rounded out by Jerome's work on the [[synthesizer]], bringing his [[Industrial music|industrial]] roots to the sound, the band works up "the Switchfoot sound"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://interlinc-online.com/artists/index.html?p=2&id=25 |title=interlinc: Switchfoot |accessdate=2007-01-13}}</ref> <U+2013> a melodic crunch of densely layered sound featuring some [[Electronic music|electronic]] experimentation, and often driven by hard-charging guitar [[riff]]s, while throwing in a few softer, spacey ballads as well.

Switchfoot first gained mainstream recognition after the inclusion of four of their songs in the 2002 movie ''[[A Walk to Remember]]''. This recognition led to their major label debut, ''[[The Beautiful Letdown]]'', which was released in 2003. It went on to sell over 2.6 million copies and produced the band's best-known singles, "[[Meant to Live]]" and "[[Dare You to Move]]".

According to Jon Foreman, the name "Switchfoot" is a surfing term. "We all love to [[surfing|surf]] and have been surfing all our lives so to us, the name made sense. To switch your feet means to take a new stance facing the opposite direction. It's about change and movement, a different way of approaching life and music".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.jesusfreakhideout.com/interviews/Switchfoot.asp |title=Switchfoot learns to breathe |date=2000-09-25 |accessdate=2006-08-09}}</ref>

==History==
Switchfoot was founded in 1996 as '''Chin Up''', consisting of Jon and his brother Tim, along with Chad on the drums. After playing only a few shows, in 1997, the band was contacted by [[Charlie Peacock]], and eventually signed to his indie label [[Rethink (record label)|Re:think Records]] under the current moniker '''Switchfoot'''. Re:think would distribute the first three Switchfoot albums, ''[[The Legend of Chin]]'', ''[[New Way to Be Human]]'' and ''[[Learning to Breathe]]''. Because Re:think was bought out by Christian giant [[Sparrow Records]] before Switchfoot's first release, however, the band's and Peacock's intentions of being marketed outside of the [[CCM]] scene were put on hold.

Of Switchfoot's first three albums ''[[Learning to Breathe]]'' was the most successful.  The album was certified gold by the RIAA, and received a [[Grammy Award|Grammy]] nomination for [[Grammy Award for Best Rock Gospel Album|Best Rock Gospel Album]].

In 2002 Switchfoot's music was featured prominently in the movie ''[[A Walk to Remember (film)|A Walk to Remember]]''. Singer and actress [[Mandy Moore]], who starred in the movie, sang Switchfoot's song "[[Only Hope]]" during a scene in the movie.  The movie's sound track also featured a duet with Mandy Moore and Jon Foreman, and as many as four other Switchfoot songs, in addition to Mandy Moore's [[Cover version|cover]] of "Only Hope".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0281358/soundtrack |title=Soundtracks for A Walk to Remember (2002) |pubisher=[[Internet Movie Database|IMDb]] |accessdate=2006-08-30}}</ref>

In 2004, following the commercial success of The Beautiful Letdown, a compilation titled ''[[The Early Years: 1997-2000]]'' was released. It featured all the indie albums released under re:think records and included the original artwork for all the albums.

===''The Beautiful Letdown''===
{{main|The Beautiful Letdown}}
In early 2003, following the exposure that came from "A Walk to Remember," Switchfoot released their major label debut, ''The Beautiful Letdown'', under [[Columbia Records]]/[[Red Distribution|Red Ink]]. The record represented the band's evolution from the predominantly [[Lo-fi music|lo-fi]], [[indie rock]] sound of their early albums, toward a more layered, synth-influenced sound that helped launch the band to mainstream popularity. This could be attributed to the fact that the album was the first to include keyboardist Jerome Fontamillas, formerly of [[Industrial music|industrial]] bands [[Mortal (band)|Mortal]] and [[Fold Zandura]].  Jerome had been touring with Switchfoot since 2000, following the release of ''Learning to Breathe''.

[[Image:SwitchfootConcert2.JPG|thumb|left|Jon Foreman and Chad Butler]]
The Beautiful Letdown has since been certified double-platinum, and went on to sell more than 2.6 million copies,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://music.monstersandcritics.com/news/article_1237131.php/Switchfoot_Omarion_and_Matisyahu_return_to_store_shelves_with_new_albums |title=Switchfoot, Omarion, and Matisyahu return to store shelves with new albums |date=2006-12-27 |accessdate=2007-01-08}}</ref> on the strength of constant touring and huge mainstream radio hits "Meant to Live" and "Dare You to Move" (which received a [[Nickelodeon (TV channel)|Nickelodeon]] Kids' Choice Award in 2005). A DVD of the band's live concert, ''[[Live in San Diego]]'', went platinum as well. "[[This Is Your Life (song)|This Is Your Life]]" was also released as a radio single, and the song "Gone" received major airplay on Christian radio stations as well. In 2005, Switchfoot received five [[GMA Dove Award|Dove Award]] nominations, [[Dove Awards of 2005|and won four]], including Artist of the year.

===''Nothing Is Sound''===
{{main|Nothing Is Sound}}
In 2005 prior to the release of ''Nothing Is Sound'' Switchfoot announced that guitarist [[Drew Shirley]] had become the band's fifth member after touring with Switchfoot since 2003. ''Nothing Is Sound'', was released on September 13, 2005, and with Drew's inclusion saw Switchfoot's sound become even more densely layered and guitar-heavy, resulting in an album that was edgier and darker than any of their previous works. To promote this album Switchfoot had previously released "[[Stars (Switchfoot song)|Stars]]" as a radio single, which was played on many mainstream radio stations. "[[We Are One Tonight]]" was released as a single in early 2006.
[[Image:Chad Butler and Jon Forman.jpg|thumb|right|Nothing is Sound Tour in Vancouver BC]]

The album debuted at #3 on the [[Billboard 200]] albums chart, an all-time high for the band, while bassist Tim Foreman attracted headlines by speaking out against the copy-protection<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.actsofvolition.com/archives/2005/september/switchfoot |title=Switchfoot Laments the Copy Protection on their CD |date=2005-09-19 |accessdate=2006-08-09}}</ref> used by the label and providing fans a detailed workaround on the band's message board, which was quickly deleted by Sony. This copy-protection is known as [[Extended Copy Protection]], which has been identified by leading anti-virus companies as a [[trojan horse (computing)|trojan horse]] and a [[rootkit]].

In Spring of 2006 the band introduced "a video diary of life on the road" in the form of freely downloadable video [[podcast]]s available via iTunes.  In addition to featuring snippets of upcoming songs and live performances, [http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewPodcast?id=137301370&s=143441 the videos] give fans an inside look at the more casual and humorous aspects of the band members' touring lives, as well as the band working on their upcoming album.

===''Oh! Gravity.''===
{{main|Oh! Gravity.}}
Switchfoot's latest album ''Oh! Gravity.'' was released on December 26, 2006, earning considerable critical acclaim. It entered the Billboard chart at #18<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.billboard.com/bbcom/news/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1003527472 |title=Omarion Leads Active Post-Christmas Album Chart |date=2007-01-03 |accessdate=2007-01-05}}</ref> and peaked at #1 on iTunes' Top Albums chart.

Prior to the release of the album, on June 2, Switchfoot e-mailed a newsletter containing a free download of "Daylight to Break" and a statement from Tim implying that the band wanted to have a new album out by the end of the year, as well as a thanks to their fans for helping keep the band together for ten years.  The band tried to involve their fans in the creation of the album,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://today.reuters.com/news/articlenews.aspx?type=musicNews&storyID=2006-10-30T092942Z_01_N30228550_RTRIDST_0_MUSIC-SWITCHFOOT-DC.XML&WTmodLoc=EntNewsMusic_C2_musicNews-5 |title=Switchfoot seeks fans' help |publisher=[[Reuters]] |date=2006-10-30 |accessdate=2006-10-30}}</ref> setting up a webcam in their recording studio, and running a contest to giving a fan the chance to play the [[cowbell (instrument)|cowbell]] part in the studio with the band.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://echo2.bandfarm.com/hostedemail/email.htm?h=bc1db182df1b4bb69b408e0eb779dc60&CID=797072014 |title=New Album Update |date=2006-08-21 |accessdate=2006-08-21 }}</ref>

[[Image:Switchfoot Live Charleston.JPG|thumb|left|Oh! Gravity Spring Tour 2007 Charleston S.C.]]

To promote the album, the band first released the song, "[[Dirty Second Hands]]," via iTunes on September 26.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1540207/20060905/switchfoot.jhtml?headlines=true |title=Switchfoot Defy Gravity For Upcoming Tour |publisher=[[MTV]] |date= 2006-09-05 |accessdate=2006-09-13}}</ref>  The title song "[[Oh! Gravity. (song)|Oh! Gravity]]" was also prereleased on iTunes on October 21, then as the album's first single, and then for radio on October 31,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fmqb.com/article.asp?id=282163 |title=Quick Hits: ... Switchfoot ... |date=2006-09-29 |accessdate=2006-10-02}}</ref> later premiering the music video on Yahoo! Music on November 13, 2006. The single enjoyed moderate success on the alternative and modern rock charts. The album's second single was "[[Awakening (song)|Awakening]]". The video for that song received over one million hits on [[YouTube]] in less than three months. On September 4, 2007, "[[Head over Heels (In This Life)|Head Over Heels (In This Life)]]" was released by Switchfoot's Christian distributor, [[Sparrow Records]] as the third single from Oh! Gravity.

===Major label independence===
On August 10, 2007, Jon Foreman revealed that the band had severed ties with [[Columbia Records]] in order to release music as an [[Independent music|Indie band]]. "Neither party has any hard feelings," he said of the split a few months later. "I think for us, the reason why we signed with Columbia was because of the people that were there. So it<U+2019>s very understandable when all those people are gone, you don<U+2019>t hold any real bad feelings or good feelings towards a company name. I think that<U+2019>s part of the problem with the corporate entity as a whole is that there<U+2019>s no true responsibility."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://mammothpress.com/index.php?area=readinterview&pid=165 |title=Switchfoot <U+2013> 02.24.08 |date=2008-03-19 |accessdate=2008-03-20}}</ref> Later in October, the band announced that they had created a new record label called [[Lowercase people#Lowercase People Records|Lowercase People Records]], in order to better make a direct connection with their fans.

Subsequently, Foreman began working on his [[Jon Foreman#Solo discography/Singles|own set of solo EP's]] (one named after each season of the year), the first of these was released on [[November 27]], [[2007]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.antimusic.com/news/07/nov/21Switchfoot_Frontman_Releasing_Seasonal_Solo_EPs.shtml |title=Switchfoot Frontman Releasing Seasonal Solo EPs |date=2007-11-20 |accessdate=2007-11-25}}</ref> Jon also began a side project with [[Sean Watkins]] of [[Nickel Creek]] that was originally called "The Real SeanJon" but has been renamed to "[[Fiction Family]]."

With their new status as an independent band, Switchfoot embarked on their 2007 fall tour, playing shows with [[Relient K]], and [[Ruth (band)|Ruth]]. The tour, dubbed the "[[Appetite For Construction Tour]]," was designed to benefit [[Habitat for Humanity International|Habitat For Humanity]], with the bands donating one dollar per ticket sold to the cause.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.2theadvocate.com/entertainment/music/10796546.html |title=Bands using music to <U+2018>build<U+2019> something that lasts |date=2007-11-03 |accessdate=2007-11-03}}</ref>  In addition Jon Foreman worked with Relient K's Matt Thiessen on the song "[[Rebuild]]" in conjunction with the theme of the tour to raise additional money for Habitat. By the end of the tour, the bands had raised over $100,000 for Habitat for Humanity.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.habitateb.org/news/switchfoot.pdf |title=Switchfoot Swaps Band Instruments For Building Tools, Raises Over $100,000 For Habitat For Humanity |date=2007-12-17 |accessdate=2008-03-20}}</ref>

In March through May, the band embarked on a short national tour (title the [[Up In Arms Tour]])<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.christiantoday.com/article/athlete.to.make.appearance.in.switchfoot.us.tour/16944.htm |title=Athlete to make appearance in Switchfoot US tour |date=2008-02-19 |accessdate=2008-07-03}}</ref>, partnering with the organization [[To Write Love on Her Arms]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.twloha.com/index.php?postid=56 |title=You tell me to live. We were meant to live. |date=2008-02-12 |accessdate=2008-07-03}}</ref>.

===New studio album===
In a March 17, 2007 [[MySpace]] blog, Jon Foreman announced that Switchfoot had begun pre-production for the new album, saying that "the new SF record is underway." On October 12, 2007, Foreman also announced that the band had begun construction of their very own studio. The band began recording their follow-up to 2006's ''Oh! Gravity.'' in the spring of 2008<ref>{{cite web |url=http://wereawakening.blogspot.com/2008/05/switchfoot-studio-news.html |title=Switchfoot Studio News |date=2008-05-05 |accessdate=2008-05-05}}</ref>  The album is currently slated for a Spring 2009 release.<ref name="billboard">{{cite web |url=http://www.billboard.com/bbcom/news/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1003834527 |title=Switchfoot Eyeing Spring 2009 For New Album |date=2008-08-01 |accessdate=2008-08-05}}</ref>

Early in 2008, the band wrote and recorded a new song called "[[This Is Home]]" for the film ''[[The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian]]''. The song was included on the film's official soundtrack and released to radio on April 25, 2008. An accompanying music video was also filmed.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.redorbit.com/news/entertainment/1447029/switchfoot_plays_music_without_walls/ |title=Switchfoot Plays Music Without Walls |date=2008-06-24 |accessdate=2008-07-03}}</ref> The song has also been used on [[ESPN]]'s [[SportsCenter]] on their feature called "Title Town."

Lowercase People Records will be partnering with independent record label [[ATO Records]] to release the new Switchfoot record, much in the same vein as the deal that ATO has with British rock band [[Radiohead]]. The executive producer for the new record, Charlie Peacock, reported that "It's no secret that Switchfoot is working with ATO and the good people at Red Light Management."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://wereawakening.blogspot.com/2008/03/exclusive-joint-interview-with-charlie.html |title=Exclusive Joint Interview with Charlie Peacock |date=2008-03-07 |accessdate=2008-03-18}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://yousingiwrite.blogspot.com/2007/11/interview-with-jon-foreman-of.html |title=Q&A with Switchfoot's Jon Foreman |date=2007-11-21 |accessdate=2008-03-18}}</ref><ref name="billboard"/>

In late June 2008, the band began recording their new record in earnest, and in July, re-launched a studio webcam, giving their fans an opportunity to follow their progress. <ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.switchfoot.com/studiocam.htm |title=Switchfoot Studio Cam |date=2008-07-01 |accessdate=2008-07-07}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://switchfootwebcam08.blogspot.com |title=Switchfoot Web Cam Blog |date=2008-07-01 |accessdate=2008-07-07}}</ref>

==Influences==
[[Image:Jonforeman.JPG|thumb|right|Switchfoot playing on July 4, 2005 in St. Louis, Missouri]]
Switchfoot's [[frontman]] and guitarist Jon Foreman cites his musical influences as [[U2]],  [[The Beatles]] and [[Keith Green]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thejesusunderground.com/interviews/switchfoot_interview.htm |title=Interview with Jon Foreman of Switchfoot |date= November 2000 |accessdate=2006-08-09}}</ref>  Guitarist Drew Shirley cites [[U2]], [[Miles Davis]], [[Stevie Ray Vaughan]], [[Tommy Walker]], [[Phil Keaggy]], [[Michael Jackson]], [[Dave Matthews Band]] and the [[Brand New Heavies]],{{Fact|date=August 2008}} while bassist Tim Foreman pays tribute to [[Stevie Wonder]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.signonsandiego.com/entertainment/street/2007/08/hotter_than_july_stevie_wonder.html |title=Hotter than July: Stevie Wonder to kick off tour here this month |publisher=[[The San Diego Union-Tribune]] |date=2007-08-02 |accessdate=2008-06-16}}</ref> Chad Butler also cites [[Dave Grohl]] as an influence for ''The Beautiful Letdown''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.unratedmagazine.com/Document.cfm?Page=Features/index.cfm&Article_ID=75 |title=Switchfoot 'Let's Go' Chicago |date= March 2003 |accessdate=2006-08-23}}</ref> Though they draw from a varied number of influences, they sound very different from any of their heroes. <U+201C>We<U+2019>ve never fit in any of the genre boxes,<U+201D> says Jon. <U+201C>I think that diversity is our strength<U+201D>.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.vh1.com/artists/az/switchfoot/bio.jhtml |title=Switchfoot |publisher=[[VH1]] |accessdate=2006-08-09}}</ref>

Songwriters like [[Bono]], [[Bob Dylan]] and [[Johnny Cash]] have inspired Jon's introspective lyrics.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.heraldnet.com/ae/story.cfm?sectionname=MUSIC&file=04031918347615.cfm |title=Switchfoot's frontman has faith in his ability |date=2004-03-19 |accessdate=2006-08-09}}</ref> "We try to make music for thinking people," he mentions,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cornerstonemag.com/pages/show_page.asp?628 |title=Far From A Letdown: Switchfoot in Chicago |accessdate=2006-08-09}}</ref> which is evident in his allusions to the works of philosophers like [[S<U+00F8>ren Kierkegaard]] and [[Augustine of Hippo]] in the songs "Sooner or Later (Soren's Song)" and "Something More (Augustine's Confession)" respectively. "[[Meant to Live]]", the band's runaway hit, was inspired by [[T. S. Eliot]]'s poem "The Hollow Men",<ref>{{cite web |url=http://learning2breathe.homestead.com/tblsongs.html#anchor_13987 |title=Song Stories from Jon Foreman |accessdate=2006-08-09}}</ref> while "[[Stars (Switchfoot song)|Stars]]", the lead single off ''[[Nothing Is Sound]]'', briefly "looks at things from the [[Ren<U+00E9> Descartes|Descartes]] perspective," according to Jon.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://learning2breathe.homestead.com/nissongs.html#anchor_13988 |title=Learning 2 Breathe(Song Stories) |accessdate=2006-11-25}}</ref>

==Switchfoot and Christian music==
Switchfoot is often referred to as a "[[Christian rock|Christian band]]", mostly due to their involvement with the [[Christian rock]] scene in their early days. But the band has shunned this label. "For us, it's a faith, not a genre", says Jon Foreman. "We've always been very open and honest about where the songs are coming from. For us, these songs are for everyone. Calling us 'Christian rock' tends to be a box that closes some people out and excludes them. And that's not what we're trying to do. Music has always opened my mind<U+2014>and that's what we want".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.boston.com/ae/music/articles/2004/01/09/switchfoot_steps_toward_stardom?mode=PF |title=Switchfoot steps toward stardom |publisher=[[The Boston Globe]] |date=2004-01-09 |accessdate=2006-08-09}}</ref> Duly, Jon's lyrics steer clear of preachiness, exclusive declarations of faith, or even any mention of [[Jesus|Jesus Christ]]; instead [[Social commentary|questioning the status quo]], probing [[Existentialism|existential]] issues through "[[Socratic dialogue]]"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.utahstatesman.com/media/storage/paper243/news/2004/10/13/Features/Question.And.Answer.With.Switchfoots.Jon.Foreman-751862.shtml |title=Question and Answer with Switchfoot's Jon Foreman |date=2004-10-13 |accessdate=2006-08-09}}</ref> in which he answers questions with more questions, exploring frustrations, or simply being
inspirational. This approach has resulted in them often being described as a "thinking person's" band.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://blogs.mercurynews.com/aei/2005/09/12/review_switchfo/ |title=Switchfoot releases new album "Nothing Is Sound" |publisher=[[San Jose Mercury News|The Mercury News]] |date=2005-09-12 |accessdate=2006-06-16}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.abc.net.au/goldcoast/stories/s1474915.htm |title=Nothing is Sound tour |date=2005-10-03 |accessdate=2006-08-09}}</ref>  Jon's poetry is acclaimed by fans and critics alike for its heartfelt honesty, which is evident in his appraisal of the [[human condition]], and in his willingness to not just embrace his [[faith]], but to express doubt as well.

As a result, the band's fan base transcends different beliefs and lifestyles. "As a musician I guess the only thing I would ask from a listener is to put the CD in, close your eyes and forget about all the peripherals," says Jon Foreman. "I guess that's a dream that may not happen in my lifetime, but I listen to music from all sorts of people and I think there is an open-minded individual who will be able to listen to music of all types."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.chartattack.com/damn/2005/10/1910.cfm |title=Switchfoot Want You To Focus On Their Music |date=2005-10-19 |accessdate=2006-08-09}}</ref> Though they hold this position, they have not alienated their Christian fans. As in their [[Indie (music)|indie]] days, they are still distributed to Christian retail outlets through [[Sparrow Records]], thereby being featured on Christian radio and charts, and presented [[GMA Music Awards|Dove Awards]], despite having been signed to [[Columbia Records]], a mainstream label. "[Signing to Columbia was] a realization of something that we'd wanted to be from the beginning," Jon explains. "When we were signed to re:think Records [an indie label], the goal was to get the music out to everybody. [But] when Sparrow [a Christian label] bought re:think Records, it was evident that our music wasn't going to be in the hands of everybody. As a Christian, I have a lot to say within the walls of the church. But also, as a Christian, I've got a lot to say just about life in general ... So to be able to be on Columbia and on Sparrow felt like the realization of the two sides of what we had to say. It's a dream come true to be able to have songs that are outside of the box."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.christianitytoday.com/music/interviews/2006/switchfoot-1106.html |title=Switchfoot, 11/06 - Interviews - Christian Music Today |date=2006-11-27 |accessdate=2006-12-27}}</ref>

Following the release of ''The Beautiful Letdown'', the band temporarily stopped playing at Christian festivals and doing interviews with Christian based organizations, as they found the speculation about their faith to be distracting from the music. Three years later, Switchfoot began going back on this policy, headlining at large Christian-based music festivals, and relenting to be featured on the June 2006 cover of [[CCM Magazine]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.growthtrac.com/artman/publish/article_839.php |title=Learning to Breathe |publisher=[[CCM Magazine]] |date= June 2006 |accessdate=2006-08-09}}</ref> after declining the opportunity for years.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ccmmagazine.com/weblogs/jay/1400300.aspx?view=print |title=Under their Influence |publisher=[[CCM Magazine]] |date=June 2006 |accessdate=2006-08-09}}</ref> Yet in many ways they used the opportunity to describe their split from the CCM industry. This has caused some, such as [[Spin (magazine)|Spin]] writer Andrew Beaujon, to take the view that "their lyrics often have two different meanings, one meaning for a Christian audience and one meaning for the rest of us. They try to relate to two different groups of people at once".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.jsonline.com/story/index.aspx?id=444350 |title=Rocking for Jesus |date=2006-06-30 |accessdate=2006-08-09}}</ref>

==Other projects==
Switchfoot has been actively involved in a number of humanitarian causes, including [[DATA]], the [[ONE Campaign]], the Keep A Breast Foundation, [[Habitat for Humanity]], [[Invisible Children]] and [[To Write Love on Her Arms]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://twloha.com/index.php?postid=29 |title=A message from Switchfoot's Jon Foreman |date=2006-12-30 |accessdate=2008-06-16}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://twloha.com/index.php?postid=56 |title=You tell me to live. We were meant to live. |date=2008-02-12 |accessdate=2008-06-16}}</ref>  In addition to supporting those causes Switchfoot has fronted the Switchfoot Bro-Am Surf Contest and the online magazine ''[[lowercase people]]''.

In addition to supporting those causes they fronted the Switchfoot Bro-Am Surf Contest, a benefit contest and concert to raise money for Care House, Casa de Amparo, and Stand-Up for Kids organizations serving homeless kids the band's hometown of San Diego.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1503055/05262005/switchfoot.jhtml |title=Switchfoot's New LP, Surf Contest Affected By Instability |publisher=[[MTV]] |date=2005-05-31 |accessdate=2006-09-13}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.signonsandiego.com/news/features/20080529-9999-1w29switch.html |title=Bro-am Bros. |publisher=[[The San Diego Union-Tribune]] |date=2008-05-29 |accessdate=2008-06-16}}</ref> Also, before recording ''Nothing Is Sound'' the band made a trip to several South African villages, which inspired the album's song "The Shadow Proves the Sunshine". Seeing things like an orphanage filled with infants who all lost their parents to AIDS, palling around with orphans in the streets, and getting involved with a children's choir called "Kuyasa Kids" moved them to start an ambitious organization called ''[[lowercase people]]''. The  organization publishes a quarterly online magazine for music, arts and social justice. They have also produced a CD by the Kuyasa Kids<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.horizoninternationalinc.com/kuyasa.html |title=sun rising |publisher=Horizon International |date=2006}}</ref> to help raise money for the children's communities.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://switchfoot.com/lcpcopy.htm |title=lowercase people |accessdate=2006-08-09}}</ref>
