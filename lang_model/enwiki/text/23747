'''Samuel Spring''' (1746<U+2013>1819) was an early [[American Revolutionary War]] chaplain and Congregationalist minister.

==Early life and education==
Spring was born in [[Uxbridge, Massachusetts|Uxbridge]] in the [[Massachusetts Colony]] on February 27, 1746.<ref name="bla">{{cite news |title= Uxbridge<U+2019>s Samuel Spring: Revolutionary War chaplain |newspaper= Blackstone Valley Tribune |page=5 |date= December 5, 2008 |author= Michael Potaski |url= http://www.blackstonevalleytribune.com/pdf/BLA.2008.12.05.pdf  |accessdate= March 27, 2011 }}</ref>
His father was John Spring (1706<U+2013>1794), a [[militia]] man and local wealthy farmer, and his mother was Sarah Read (1716<U+2013>1800).<ref name="gene">{{cite book |title= Genealogies of the families and descendants of the early settlers of Watertown, Massachusetts, including Waltham and Weston |authors= Henry Bond, Horatio Gates Jones |publisher= Northeastern Historic-genealogical Society |year= 1860 |pages= 446<U+2013>447 |url= http://books.google.com/books?id=_oc6AQAAIAAJ&pg=PA446 }}</ref> John later commanded the company of militia from Uxbridge in the [[American Revolution]]. His father was the town's moderator, [[selectman]], and surveyor of highways, but John lacked even a rudimentary education. Sarah remained determined that Samuel would have the best education possible.<ref name="bla"/>

Spring studied under the Rev. [[Nathan Webb]], founding pastor of the first Congregational church begun in the [[First Great Awakening]] period of the Massachusetts Colony. Webb's early training of Spring helped prepare him to enter New Jersey College (now [[Princeton University]]), where he graduated in 1771. He took advanced theological studies from his future father-in-law, [[Samuel Hopkins (1721<U+2013>1803)|Samuel Hopkins]]. His former mentor, Rev. Webb died in 1772. Spring was licensed as a minister in 1774 on the eve of the [[American Revolution]]. [[Aaron Burr]] was one of his classmates in Theological Studies at Princeton, who went on to study law.

==Revolutionary War service==
When the Revolution's stirrings began the Provincial Congress required the militia to have chaplains. Spring took up his Colony's call. He served in both the [[Siege of Boston]] and in the [[Invasion of Canada (1775)|invasion of Canada]]. He initially served in the regiment commanded by Colonel John Fellows of Sheffield. Burr also served at the [[Siege of Boston]]. When Colonel [[Benedict Arnold]] convinced General [[George Washington]] to open a second front against the British in Canada, Spring and Burr both joined this force under Colonel Benedict Arnold. Ships sailed from [[Newburyport, Massachusetts]] to [[Maine]]. At Fort Western, near what is now [[Augusta, Maine]], Spring counseled Private James McCormick who was sentenced to death, only to be reprieved. At one point, Spring carried Aaron Burr, after he had been wounded.

The trip through Maine left a tattered, very ill army to invade Quebec. [[French Canadians]] helped the Americans with supplies and clothing. At [[Quebec]] Senter took possession of the hotel Dieu on the banks of the St. Charles river. Spring converted the hotel to a hospital and chapel. Benedict Arnold's leg was shattered in the siege of Quebec, during the ill fated New Year's Eve assault on the fortress city walls. Spring carried Benedict Arnold from the battlefield to the Hotel Dieu (the hospital). American troops occupied [[Montreal]] and [[Trois Rivieres]] and maintained the [[Siege of Quebec|Siege on Quebec]]. Colonel John Patterson's regiment was dispatched to Quebec to shore up American positions. The American troops retreated back to the [[Lake Champlain]] area at Mt. Independence. Regrouped soldiers heard Spring's sermon on November 3, 1776 at this encampment. Chaplain Spring was discharged from the [[Continental Army]] at the end of 1776.

==Marriage and later work==
Reverend Spring returned to Newburyport and married Hannah Hopkins, his mentor's daughter November 4, 1779.<ref name="church">{{cite book |title= A Record of proceedings in the North Congregational Church, Newburyport, January 24, 1868 |author= William Anderson McGinnley |publisher= George W.

He was very influential in a [[fundamentalist]] wing of the [[Congregational Church]] and many of his sermons and discourses were printed and widely disseminated. [[John Quincy Adams]] was one of many who disagreed with Spring's teachings; Adams wrote that Spring's views were "extremely contracted and illiberal" and that he had the "enthusiasm of a bigot". Spring maintained contacts with Uxbridge.

He and his wife had 11 children, although several died young:<ref>{{cite book |title= Vital Records of Newburyport, Massachusetts, to the End of the Year 1849: Births |page= 361 |url= http://books.google.com/books?id=bsgMAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA361 }}</ref>
