Jerzy Zakulski was born to a family of high-school teacher Ludwik Zakulski. They settled in Krak<U+00F3>w at <U+015B>w. Kingi 7 street in the district of [[Podg<U+00F3>rze]]. Jerzy enrolled at the [[Jagiellonian University]] and graduated with the law degree in 1936. Two years later he passed the exams for an attorney. On 1&nbsp;September 1939 Poland was invaded by Nazi Germany. Zakulski was conscripted with the reserve military rank of ''[[Podporucznik]]'' of the [[Polish Army]] and took part in the [[September campaign]].<ref name="IPN-Bi"/> 

After Poland's defeat Zakulski joined the underground [[Military Organization Lizard Union]] (''Zwi<U+0105>zek Jaszczurczy'') due to his prewar contacts in the ''Organizacja Polska''.<ref name="IPN-Bi"/> In the Podg<U+00F3>rze district where he lived, on 3 March 1941 the Nazis created [[Krak<U+00F3>w Ghetto]] on the orders of ''Gauleiter'' [[Hans Frank]].<ref name="krakow-poland">Krakow-Poland.com, [http://www.krakow-poland.com/a/Krakow-Ghetto,ehc  History of the Krakow Ghetto with photographs.]&nbsp;{{en icon}} Accessed 9&nbsp;April&nbsp;2014.</ref> Some 15,000 Jews were removed from their homes in the district of [[Kazimierz]] <U+2013> the main spiritual and cultural centre of Krak<U+00F3>w Jewry <U+2013> and crammed into an area previously inhabited by 3,000 people.<ref name="krakow-poland"/><ref name="jewishkrakow.net">Jewish Krakow, [http://www.jewishkrakow.net/en/see/krakow-ghetto/ Krakow Ghetto, complete with gallery of contemporary photographs.]&nbsp;{{en icon}} Accessed 9&nbsp;April&nbsp;2014.</ref> One night, before the liquidation of [[Krak<U+00F3>w Ghetto|the Ghetto]] in the course of murderous [[Operation Reinhard in Krak<U+00F3>w]] under [[Holocaust]] perpetrator [[Amon G<U+00F6>th]], Maria B<U+0142>eszy<U+0144>ska Bernstein escaped with her three year old daughter, and was rescued by Jerzy Zakulski. He engaged his whole family in the rescue mission including his father-in-law Jan Bahr, hiding Maria and her child in both households by turns. Eventually, they took them out of the city to a safer place of a cousin Zofia Strycharska in [[My<U+015B>lenice]]. Both Maria and her daughter survived the war and relocated back to Krak<U+00F3>w. In her letter to the Stalinist military court in Warsaw dated 23 June 1947, Maria, living on D<U+0142>uga 32 street at the time, insisted that Zakulskis risked their lives to save theirs.<ref name="IPN-Bi"/>
