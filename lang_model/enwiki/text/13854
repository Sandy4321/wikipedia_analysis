'''''Invincible''''' is the tenth and last studio album by American recording artist [[Michael Jackson]] released in his lifetime. The album was released by [[Epic Records]] on October 30, 2001. ''Invincible'' was the first release of new Jackson material since ''[[Blood on the Dance Floor: HIStory in the Mix]]'' in 1997 and the first studio album in six years since ''[[HIStory: Past, Present and Future, Book I]]''. Jackson, [[Rodney Jerkins]], [[R. Kelly]] and [[Teddy Riley (producer)|Teddy Riley]] received producing and writing credits among others. Similar to Jackson's previous material, the themes in ''Invincible'' are mainly based on Jackson's personal experiences with fame and media, romance, and social issues. ''Invincible'' received generally mixed reviews from contemporary music critics. The album's singles were incomplete in their release.<ref name = "tara 614<U+2013>617">Taraborrelli, p. 614<U+2013>617</ref> Jackson was able to use these conflicts as leverage to exit his contract early.<ref name = "tara 610<U+2013>611">Taraborrelli, p. 610<U+2013>611</ref>

Three singles were released from the album: "[[You Rock My World]]", "[[Cry (Michael Jackson song)|Cry]]" and "[[Butterflies (Michael Jackson song)|Butterflies]]" of which the first and second were released as physical singles internationally (except the USA) and the third one being a US-only radio-airplay single. The album's first and last singles charted within the top twenty on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100 Chart]], and they peaked at number one and within the top ten in several markets worldwide; "Cry" was less commercially successful. Following a conflict between Jackson and his record label, [[Sony Music]] stopped promoting the album. The album was the recipient of one [[Grammy Award]] nomination for Best Pop Vocal Performance - Male, as well as being voted, by readers of ''Billboard'' magazine, the best album of the decade.

The album peaked at number one in eleven territories worldwide, including the United States (with sales of 363,000 units its first week), the United Kingdom, Australia, France and Switzerland. ''Invincible'' charted within the top ten in six other territories; its least successful charting area was Mexico, where the album peaked at number twenty nine. ''Invincible'' re-entered music charts several times during the decade. Despite the reported{{By whom|date=December 2010}} worldwide sales of 10 million copies, the album has been viewed as a commercial failure compared to Jackson's previous albums sales.

== Background ==
During Jackson's time as a member of [[The Jackson 5]], he frequently wrote material for the group and began working on projects as a solo artist, which eventually led to recording his own studio albums, notably ''[[Off the Wall (album)|Off The Wall]]'' (1979)  and ''[[Thriller (album)|Thriller]]'' (1982). The success of ''Thriller'', which currently is the best selling album of all time with a reported 110 million units sold, often over shadowed Jackson's other projects. Prior to the release of ''Invincible'', Jackson had not released any new material since ''[[Blood on the Dance Floor: HIStory in the Mix]]'' in 1997, or a studio album since ''[[HIStory: Past, Present and Future, Book I]]'' in 1995. ''Invincible'' was thus looked at as Jackson's 'career come back'.<ref name="ALG Invincible"/> 

''Invincible'' is dedicated to the fifteen year old Afro-Norwegian boy [[Benjamin Hermansen|Benjamin "Benny" Hermansen]] who was stabbed to death by a group of [[neo-Nazi]]s in [[Oslo]], Norway, in January 2001.<ref name="dedication"/> The reason for this tribute was partly due to the fact that another Oslo youth, Omer Bhatti, Jackson's friend, was also a good friend of Hermansen.<ref name="dedication"/> The dedication in the album reads, "Michael Jackson gives 'special thanks': This album is dedicated to Benjamin 'Benny' Hermansen. May we continue to remember not to judge man by the color of his skin, but the content of his Character. Benjamin ... we love you ... may you rest in peace."<ref name="dedication">{{cite web |url=http://www.aftenposten.no/english/local/article216474.ece |title=Jacko dedicates Invincible to Benjamin |author=Liz McNamaba |work=[[Aftenposten]] |publisher=[[Schibsted|Schibsted ASA]] |date=2001-10-23 |accessdate=2010-02-13}}</ref> The album is also dedicated to Jackson's grandmother Nicholette Sottile and his parents [[Joe Jackson (manager)|Joseph]] and [[Katherine Jackson]].<ref name="dedication"/>

== Production ==
Jackson began recording new material for the album in October 1997, and finished with the album's recordings with "You Are My Life" being recorded only eight weeks before the album's release in August 2001.<ref name="mtvinfo1">{{cite web |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1435389/20001221/jackson_michael.jhtml |title=Michael Jackson Nearing Completion Of New LP |author=Brian Hiatt |work=[[MTV]] |publisher=[[Viacom]] |date=2000-12-21 |accessdate=2010-02-13}}</ref> Jackson had shown interest in including a rapper on at least one song, and had noted that he did not want a 'known rapper'.<ref name="mtvinfo1"/> Jackson's spokesperson suggested New Jersey rapper named Fats; after Jackson heard the finished product of the song, the two agreed to recorded another song together for the album.<ref name="mtvinfo1"/> [[Rodney Jerkins]] stated that Jackson was looking to record material in a different musical direction than his previous work, describing the new direction as "edgier".<ref name="mtvinfo1"/> Jackson received credit for both writing and producing a majority of the songs on ''Invincible''.  Aside from Jackson, the album features productions by Jerkins, [[Teddy Riley (producer)|Teddy Riley]], [[Andre Harris]], [[Andreao Heard|Andraeo "Fanatic" Heard]], [[Babyface (musician)|Kenneth "Babyface" Edmonds]], [[R.

''Invincible'' is composed of [[Contemporary R&B|R&B]], [[Hip hop music|hip hop]], [[dance-pop]], [[Adult contemporary music|adult contemporary]] and [[Urban contemporary|urban]] songs.<ref name="RS Invincible"/> Fourteen out of the album's sixteen tracks were written by Jackson. The album's full length is seventy-seven minutes eight seconds. The sixteen songs' lyrics reflect on Jackson's personal experiences, which mainly consist of romance, paranoia, invasion of privacy and threatening situations.<ref name="RS Invincible"/> It was noted that the album shifts between aggressive songs and ballads.<ref name="e.w.review"/> ''Invincible'' opens with "Unbreakable"; the last line in the first verse recites the lyrics, "With all that I've been through/I'm still around".<ref name="RS Invincible"/> In a 2002 interview with the magazine ''[[Vibe (magazine)|Vibe]]'', Jackson commented on his inspiration for writing "Speechless", saying

{{quote|You'll be surprised.

"Privacy", a reflection on Jackson's own personal experiences, is about media invasions and tabloid inaccuracies.<ref name="RS Invincible"/> "The Lost Children" is about imperiled children.<ref name="RS Invincible"/> Jackson sings in a third person in "Whatever Happens". The song's lyrics, described as having a "jagged intensity", narrate the story of two people involved in an unnamed threatening situation.<ref name="RS Invincible"/> ''Invincible'' features four ballads: "You Are My Life", "Butterflies", "Don't Walk Away" and "Cry".<ref name="RS Invincible"/> "Cry", similar to Jackson's "[[Man in the Mirror]]", is about healing the world together.<ref name="ALG Invincible"/> The lyrics to "Butterflies" and "Break of Dawn" were viewed as "glaringly" and being able to "emanate" to listeners.<ref name="e.w.review"/>  "Threatened" was viewed as being a story teller.<ref name="RS Invincible"/> The song was viewed as a "Thriller redux".<ref name="e.w.review"/> The song "You Are My Life" is about Jackson's two children at the time, Prince and Paris. The song features Jackson singing, "You are the sun, you make me shine, more like the stars."<ref name="e.w.review"/>

"Ekam Satyam", a track composed by Indian musician [[A. R. Rahman]], was supposed to be included in the album. The song, written by Rahman along with Kanika Myer was performed by Jackson. Also considered to be released as a single, it was never released.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/entertainment/bollywood/news-interviews/Rahman-MJ-create-Ekam-Satyam/articleshow/278699863.cms|title=Rahman, MJ create Ekam Satyam|author= |work= |publisher=[[The Times of India]]|date=2001-09-10 |accessdate=2001-09-10}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/A-R-Rahman-joins-hands-with-Michael-Jackson/articleshow/1249822469.cms|title=A R Rahman joins hands with Michael Jackson|author=Nydia Dias |work= TNN |publisher=[[The Times of India]]|date=2001-08-17 |accessdate=2001-08-17}}</ref>

== Sony Music contract issues ==
Jackson was waiting for licenses to the masters of his albums to revert back to him, thus allowing him to promote his old material and preventing Sony from getting a cut of the profit. Jackson expected this to occur early in the new millennium, however, due to the fine print and various clauses in the contract, the revert date is still many years away. Jackson began an investigation, and it emerged that the attorney who represented the singer in the deal was also representing Sony, creating a [[conflict of interest]].<ref name = "tara 610<U+2013>611"/> Jackson was also concerned about another conflict of interest. For a number of years, Sony had been negotiating to buy Jackson's [[Sony/ATV Music Publishing|music catalog]]. If Jackson's career or financial situation were to deteriorate, it would be in Jackson's financial interest to sell his catalog. Thus, Sony had something to gain from Jackson's career failing.<ref name = "tara 614<U+2013>617">Taraborrelli, p. 614<U+2013>617</ref> Jackson was able to use these conflicts as leverage to exit his contract early.<ref name = "tara 610<U+2013>611">Taraborrelli, p. 610<U+2013>611</ref> 

Just before the release of ''Invincible'', Jackson informed the head of Sony Music Entertainment, [[Tommy Mottola]] he was leaving the record label.<ref name = "tara 610<U+2013>611"/> As a result, all singles releases, video shootings and promotions concerning the ''Invincible'' album were cancelled. Jackson made allegations in July 2002 that Mottola was a "devil" and a "racist" who did not support his African-American artists, using them merely for his own personal gain.<ref name="promotioninfo"/><ref name = "tara 610<U+2013>611"/> He charged that Mottola had called his colleague [[Irving Lorenzo|Irv Gotti]] a "fat black [[nigger]]".<ref>{{cite news |url=http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0212/31/cct.00.html |author=Jermaine Jackson |title=Interview with Jermaine Jackson |date=2002-12-31 |work=[[Connie Chung Tonight]] |publisher=[[Time Warner|Time Warner Inc]] |accessdate=2010-02-14}}</ref> Sony disputed claims that they had failed to promote ''Invincible'' with sufficient energy, maintaining that Jackson refused to tour in the United States.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2002/jul/08/oliverburkeman |author=Oliver Burkeman |title=Jacko gets tough: but is he a race crusader or just a falling star? |work=[[The Guardian]] |publisher=[[Guardian Media Group]] |date=2002-07-08 |accessdate=2010-02-13 | location=London}}</ref> The singer accused Sony and the [[record industry]] of racism, deliberately not promoting or actively working against promotion of his album.<ref name="Falling star"/>

== Commercial performance ==
''Invincible'' was Jackson's first studio album to be released in four years, since ''Blood on the Dance Floor'' in 1997.<ref name="billboardchartinvincible"/> In the album's first week of release, with the sales of 363,000 units, the album debuted at number one on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] on the charts issue date of November 17, 2001.<ref name="billboardchartinvincible">{{cite web |url=http://www.billboard.com/charts/billboard-200#/news/jackson-s-invincible-to-debut-at-no-1-1098108.story |title=Jackson's 'Invincible' To Debut At No. 1 |work=Billboard |publisher=Nielsen Business Media, Inc |date=2001-11-07 |accessdate=2010-01-18}}</ref><ref name="billboardweek1">{{cite web |url=http://www.billboard.com/charts/billboard-200#/charts/billboard-200?chartDate=2001-11-17 |title=Week of November 17, 2001 |work=Billboard |publisher=Nielsen Business Media, Inc |accessdate=2010-01-18}}</ref> ''Invincible'' was Jackson's fifth number one entry on the ''Billboard'' 200,<ref name="billboardchartinvincible"/> and the fourth to chart at number one in its debut week as a solo artist. Despite the first week sales of ''Invincible'' being good, the album sold less than ''HIStory'' in its opening week, with the album having sold 391,000 units.<ref name="billboardchartinvincible"/> ''Invincible'' also charted at number one on [[Billboard Charts|''Billboard''s R&B/Hip Hop Albums Chart]] for four weeks.<ref name="billboard2weeks">{{cite web |url=http://www.billboard.com/charts/billboard-200#/charts/r-b-hip-hop-albums?chartDate=2001-12-08 |title=Week of December 08, 2001 |work=Billboard |publisher=Nielsen Business Media, Inc |accessdate=2010-02-12}}</ref> After eight weeks of release, in December 2001, ''Invincible'' was certified gold by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA) for the sales of five hundred thousand units.<ref name="riaacertificate"/> In the same month the album was certified platinum for the sale of one million units.<ref name="riaacertificate"/> On January 25, 2002, the album was certified two times platinum for the sales of two million units.<ref name="riaacertificate">{{cite web |url=http://www.riaa.com/goldandplatinumdata.php?table=SEARCH_RESULTS |title=Gold & Platinum |publisher=[[Recording Industry Association of America]] |accessdate=2010-02-12}}</ref>

Internationally, ''Invincible'' was a commercial success. The album peaked at number one in twelve countries worldwide,<ref name="billboardchartinvincible"/> including the United Kingdom, Australia, Belgium, Denmark, The Netherlands, Germany, Norway, Sweden and Switzerland.<ref name="billboardchartinvincible"/><ref name="lescharts"/> It also charted within the top ten in several countries, including Austria, Canada, Finland, Italy, New Zealand, and Norway.<ref name="lescharts"/> Mexico was the album's least successful charting territory, peaking within the top thirty at number twenty nine.<ref name="lescharts"/> The album has reportedly sold thirteen million units worldwide.<ref name="Invincible 13 million copies">{{cite web |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/tamara-conniff/we-killed-michael-jackson_b_272174.html |title=We Killed Michael Jackson |author=Tamara Conniff  |work=[[Huffington Post]] |publisher=HuffingtonPost.com, Inc |date=2009-08-30 |accessdate=2009-08-30}}</ref> However, the sales for ''Invincible'' were notably low compared to his previous releases, due in part to a diminishing pop music industry, the lack of promotion, no supporting world tour and the label dispute.<ref name = "tara 614<U+2013>617"/> Commenting on the sales of ''Invincible'' back in late 2003, Bernard Zuel of ''[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]'' stated:

<blockquote>"[[Holly Valance]] or [[Delta Goodrem]] would think their Christmases had come at once if they sold five or six million copies of their albums worldwide. Michael Jackson did something similar in the past two years with his seventh solo album, ''Invincible'', and he's been branded a failure in the industry and the media. Unfair? Yes, of course, because his ''Invincible'' figures are better than those for 95 per cent of the thousands of artists released each year and would provide a healthy retirement fund for anyone. What's more, that failure tag is consistently applied by comparisons with his 1982 album, ''[[Thriller (album)|Thriller]]'', which has sold about 100 million copies and its follow-ups, ''[[Bad (album)|Bad]]'', that sold about 30 million copies. However, selling 10 million copies is still phenomenal compared to the album sales of most artists."<ref name="Falling star">{{cite news |url=http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2003/11/19/1069027185212.html  |author=Bernard Zuel |title=Falling star |work=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]] |publisher=[[Fairfax Media]] |date=2003-11-20 |accessdate=2010-02-13}}</ref></blockquote>
