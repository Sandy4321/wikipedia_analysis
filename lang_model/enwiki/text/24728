'''''Liber Eliensis''''' (sometimes '''''Historia Eliensis'''''<ref name=Introxiii>Fairweather "Introduction" ''Liber Eliensis'' p. xiii</ref> or '''''Book of Ely''''') is a 12th century English chronicle and history, written in medieval [[Latin]]. Composed in two parts, one between 1109 and 1133 and the other between 1173 and 1189, it was written on the island of [[Ely, Cambridgeshire|Ely]] in the [[The Fens|fenland]]s of eastern [[Cambridgeshire]]. The church of Ely, [[Ely Abbey|originally an abbey]], became the [[Ely Cathedral|cathedral]] of a [[Diocese of Ely|bishopric]] in 1109. 

The ''Liber'' covers the time frame from the founding of the abbey in 673 until the middle 12th century. It builds on a number of previous historical works, as well as incorporating documents and stories of [[hagiography|saints' lives]]. The two surviving complete manuscripts of the work are complemented by a number of other partial manuscripts. A printed version of the Latin text appeared in 1963 and a translation was published in 2005. The ''Liber Eliensis'' is an important source for historical information for the region and time-frame covered, particularly for the abbey and bishopric.

==Background and authorship==

It was written at the abbey-turned-cathedral church of [[Ely Abbey]].<ref name=Stafford20>Stafford ''Unification and Conquest'' p. 20</ref><ref name=Stafford180>Stafford ''Unification and Conquest'' pp. 180&ndash;181</ref> It was written in two stages: firstly under Bishop [[Hervey le Breton]], who was bishop from 1109 to 1133; and secondly under Bishop [[Geoffrey Ridel]], who was bishop from 1173 to 1189.<ref name=Houts136>van Houts "Historical Writing" ''Companion to the Anglo-Norman World'' p. 136</ref> Traditionally the work was ascribed to either Thomas or Richard, two monks of Ely mentioned in the text; the evidence for their authorship however has been dismissed by historians, and today the work is usually regarded as anonymous.<ref name=Introxvii>Fairweather "Introduction" ''Liber Eliensis'' p. xvii</ref> 

The historian [[Dorothy Whitelock]] said of the work that it is "unique among post-Conquest monastic histories".<ref name=QTexts>Quoted in Royal Historical Society ''Texts and Calendars II'' p. 90</ref> It was written to help buttress the claims of Ely to a judicial liberty. It also collected together earlier sources used to help the abbey evade episcopal control, prior to the abbey becoming a bishopric. These documents may have been forged or had their contents doctored to help the abbey's cause. Because of the tendentious nature of the collection, the work is used by historians with great caution.<ref name=CamIntroxlix>Blake "Introduction" ''Liber Eliensis'' pp. xlix&ndash;l</ref> Despite the untrustworthy nature of the ''Liber'' and the documents preserved therein, it remains a valuable source for the history of the time period covered as well as the internal history of the abbey and bishopric.<ref name=CamIntroliii>Blake "Introduction" ''Liber Eliensis'' pp. liii&ndash;liv</ref>

==Sources==

To a large extent, the work is composite; that is, it is a compilation borrowing or at least using earlier sources. These include the early medieval writer [[Bede]]'s ''[[Historia ecclesiastica gentis Anglorum]]'', a chronicle that was associated with Bede's ''[[De temporum ratione]]'', [[Florence of Worcester]]'s ''Chronicon ex chronicis'', and [[William of Poitiers]]' ''Gesta Guillelmi II ducis Normannorum''. Lesser used sources of information include the ''[[Anglo-Saxon Chronicle]]'', [[Orderic Vitalis]]' ''Historia Ecclesiastica'', Stephen of Ripon's ''[[Vita Sancti Wilfrithi]]'', [[William of Malmesbury]]'s ''[[Gesta pontificum Anglorum]]'', a king's list of the [[King of Wessex|Kings of Wessex]], the poem about the [[Battle of Maldon]], and a number of saints' lives, including some written by [[Eadmer]], Felix, [[Abbo of Fleury]], [[Goscelin]], and [[Osbern of Canterbury]].<ref name=CamIntroxxviii>Blake "Introduction" ''Liber Eliensis'' pp. xxviii&ndash;xxix</ref>

Works more directly related to Ely were also used. The main source for this was  Bishop [[<U+00C6>thelwold of Winchester]]'s ''Libellus'', large parts of which were copied into the ''Liber Eliensis''.<ref name=Stafford16>Stafford ''Unification and Conquest'' p. 16</ref> Also incorporated into the ''Liber'' was a an earlier ''Vita'', or saints' life, on Saint [[<U+00C6>thelthryth]], or Ethelreda, the founder of the Abbey of Ely and also its abbess.<ref name=CamIntroxxx>Blake "Introduction" ''Liber Eliensis'' pp. xxx&ndash;xxxi</ref> Along with those works, a work on the benefactors of the abbey was used.<ref name=CamIntroxxxviii>Blake "Introduction" ''Liber Eliensis'' p. xxxviii</ref> The material from three surviving [[cartulary|cartularies]] is incorporated too.<ref name=CamIntroxxxix>Blake "Introduction" ''Liber Eliensis'' p. xxxix</ref>

==Contents==

The work is traditionally divided up into three books. Book I also contains a prologue and a preface. It discusses the founding of the Abbey of Ely as well as the background of the foundress, <U+00C6>thelthryth. Further information in the first book deals with the history of the abbey and its abbesses up until the Danish invasions. A description of the destruction of the abbey by the Danes and a further description of King Edgar's rule concludes the book.<ref name=LE9>Fairweather (ed.) ''Liber Eliensis'' pp. 9<U+2013>11</ref> The second book, Book II, begins with the restoration of the abbey during Edgar's reign, under Bishop <U+00C6>thelwold. Events for the following abbots up until the last abbot, Richard, are included in Book II, along with numerous charters and other documents.<ref name=LE85>Fairweather (ed.) ''Liber Eliensis'' pp. 85<U+2013>95</ref> The final book, Book III, contains information on the conversion of the abbey to a bishopric, and information on the first few bishops, and concludes with a description of the martyrdom of [[Thomas Becket]]. Interspersed within the historical narrative are a number of documents and charters relating to the bishops.<ref name=LE286>Fairweather (ed.) ''Liber Eliensis'' pp. 286<U+2013>296</ref>

==Manuscripts==

The work survives in two complete manuscripts, that of [[Trinity College, Cambridge]] MS O.2.1, usually known as the E manuscript; and one in the possession of [[Ely Cathedral]] Chapter, usually known as the F manuscript. The E manuscript dates from the late 12th century, and shows three different scribal hands. The F manuscript dates to the early 13th century, and four different scribal hands can be distinquished.<ref name=CamIntroxxiii>Blake "Introduction" ''Liber Eliensis'' pp. xxiii&ndash;xxiv</ref> Besides the two complete manuscripts, a number of other manuscripts contain parts of the whole work. [[Cotton Library|British Museum MS Cotton Titus A.i]], usually known as the G manuscript, has part of Book II, and dates from either the late 12th or early 13th century. British Museum Cotton Domitian xv, known as the B manuscript, dates from the late 13th or early 14th century and includes some other material along with Book I and the same parts of Book II as in manuscript G. Another manuscript, British Museum MS Cotton Vespasian A.xix has parts of Book III, and dates to between 1257 and 1286.<ref name=CamIntroxxv>Blake "Introduction" ''Liber Eliensis'' p. xxv</ref> This manuscript is usually known as the A manuscript.<ref name=Introxxv>Fairweather "Introduction" ''Liber Eliensis'' p. xxv</ref>

The relationships between the various extant manuscripts is complex, and a definitive scheme of how the various manuscripts relate to each other cannot be made.<ref name=CamIntroxlii>Blake "Introduction" ''Liber Eliensis'' p. xlii</ref> Blake, in his edition of the ''Liber'' suggests that Book I once existed as a stand alone work, which influenced the B manuscript. A separate Book II, with parts of Book III, was then written, and then combined with the stand alone Book I, into either manuscript E or an earlier version of that manuscript. The Book II work was then revised, combined with parts of G, Book I, and parts of E to make manuscript F.<ref name=CamIntroxlvi>Blake "Introduction" ''Liber Eliensis'' p. xlvi</ref>

Related manuscripts include [[Bodleian Library]] Oxford MS Laud 647, known as the O manuscript.<ref name=Introxxv/> This is based on the ''Liber'', but reorganized into a listing of the acts of the various abbots and bishops. Blake, in his edition of the ''Liber'', called this work, and related works, the ''Chronicon Abbatum et Episcoporum Eliensium''.<ref name=CamIntroxxvi>Blake "Introduction" ''Liber Eliensis'' pp. xxv&ndash;xxvi</ref> Another related work is contained in Trinity College Cambridge MS O.2.41, which contains the ''Libellus'' of <U+00C6>thelwold and an Ely [[cartulary]]. Containing just cartularies are British Library Cotton MS Tiberius A vi and Cambridge University Library Ely Diocesan Register Liber M.<ref name=Introxxv/>

==Printing history==

It has been published by the [[Royal Historical Society]] in their Camden Third Series, edited by E. O. Blake. The edition contains the Latin text along with some [[Old English]] texts.<ref name=Texts>Royal Historical Society ''Texts and Calendars II'' p. 90</ref> A more recent version is the translation by Janet Fairwether, published in 2005 by the [[Boydell Press]].<ref name=LE>Fairwether (ed.)
