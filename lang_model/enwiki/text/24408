== Early life ==
Skip Holtz grew up in many towns while his father coached football. After Skip was born in Connecticut, the Holtz family moved to [[Columbia, South Carolina|Columbia]], [[South Carolina]] for two years, as his father worked as an assistant coach at the University of South Carolina. In 1968, the family moved to [[Columbus, Ohio|Columbus]], [[Ohio]] after Holtz took a job at [[Ohio State Buckeyes football|The Ohio State University]]. One year later, the Holtz family moved to [[Williamsburg, Virginia|Williamsburg]], [[Virginia]] and [[The College of William and Mary]] for Lou's first head coaching position. After two seasons, Lou Holtz took a head coaching position with the [[NC State Wolfpack football|Wolfpack]] of [[North Carolina State University]].  The family lived in [[Raleigh, North Carolina|Raleigh]], [[North Carolina]] for four years until Lou accepted a head coaching job for the [[National Football League]]'s [[New York Jets]]. The family spent one year in [[New York]] while Lou coached the Jets. After resigning from the Jets, Lou took his family back to the [[American South]] when he accepted the head coaching job in [[Fayetteville, Arkansas|Fayetteville]], [[Arkansas]], at the University of Arkansas in 1977. In Fayetteville, Skip attended Fayetteville High School and graduated in 1983.<ref>{{cite web| title = Lou Holtz| work = Coach Bio| publisher = BlueAndGold.com| date = 2008| url = http://www.blueandgold.com/coaches/coach.cfm?coachid=25| accessdate = 2008-03-09}}</ref>

==Playing experience==
While at high school in Fayetteville, Skip played for the school's football team at the quarterback position, bringing moderate success to the program. Growing up, Skip's ambition was to attend the [[University of Notre Dame]]. As a high school junior, he visited Notre Dame and met with head football coach [[Gerry Faust]] and head basketball coach [[Digger Phelps]]. In his final year of high school, Skip was denied admission to Notre Dame due to average grades and his failure to learn a foreign language in high school. Coaches Faust and Phelps encouraged Skip to enroll at nearby Holy Cross College, located adjacent to the university in [[Notre Dame, Indiana|Notre Dame]], [[Indiana]]. After two years of study at at Holy Cross, Skip had improved his grades and transfered to Notre Dame. After a year at Notre Dame, Slip decided he wanted to speak with Coach Faust about [[walk-on|walking on]] to the football team during his senior year. The discussions were cut short, however, as after the [[Notre Dame Fighting Irish football#Faust era (1981-1985)|1985 season]], Coach Faust resigned. Replacing Faust was Skip's father, Lou, who eagerly accepted his son as a walk-on. Skip began spring practice before the [[1986 NCAA Division I-A football season|1986 season]] as a quarterback, but quickly changed to [[wide receiver|flanker]] due to his lack of talent. As a flanker, he earned 54&nbsp;yards on three [[reception]]s at the Blue-Gold intra-squad game in the spring of 1986. During the [[Notre Dame Fighting Irish football#Holtz era (1986<U+2013>1996)|fall of 1986]], Skip played in all 11 games on [[American football positions#Special teams|special teams]]. He never caught a pass, but [[rush]]ed once for one yard.<ref name="ND Book">{{cite book| last = Hansen| first = Eric  | title = Notre Dame: Where Have You Gone?| publisher = Sports Publishing LLC | date = 2005| location = South Bend, IN| pages = 81-85| url = http://books.google.com/books?id=FLQZWs1LulUC&pg=PA81&source=gbs_toc_r&cad=0_0&sig=mQFJ5QGz-8ceAHcrbf0fqP_68tU#PPA81,M1| isbn = 1582611513}}</ref>

==Coaching experience==

===Early positions===
Due to Skip's lack of success on the field and his desire to remain associated with football, he began to investigate the possibility of becoming a coach. After Skip told Lou he wanted to start coaching, Lou put together a list of potential coaches who would give him the best training.  The list included [[Tom Osborne]], [[Joe Paterno]], and [[Terry Donahue]], but upon hearing of Skip's interest, [[Florida State Seminoles football|Florida State]] head coach [[Bobby Bowden]] said, "if you can be here in two days, I've got a job for you at Florida State."<ref name="Dadmag">{{cite web| last = Zenner| first = Tom| title = Notre Dame legend Lou Holtz made his son a believer-at home| work = Life Lessons From Coach's Playbook| publisher = DadMag.com| date = 2000-09-08| url = http://www.dadmag.com/guycenter/lou_holtz.php| accessdate = 2008-03-09}}</ref> Upon arriving at Florida State in 1987, Bowden asked Holtz to become his graduate assistant coach.<ref name="UConn"/> Skip accepted the offer immediately, and began work. Some time afterward, Skip met his future wife, Jennifer, in Coach Bowden's office.<ref name="Meeting">{{cite news| last = Hudson| first = Jane Welborn| title = The four F's: Food, fun, fellowship and football for the Holtz family| publisher = The Daily Reflector| date = 2005-08-29| url = http://www.ecu.edu/cs-admin/news/inthenews/archives/2005/08/082805homewithholtz.cfm| accessdate = 2008-03-08}}</ref> After two years at Florida State, Holtz then took a job as [[wide receivers coach]] at [[Colorado State University]] under legendary coach [[Earle Bruce]].<ref name="USC"/> A year later, Skip joined his father, still the head coach at [[Notre Dame Fighting Irish football|Notre Dame]].<ref name="USC"/>

===Notre Dame===

[[Image:Notre-dame-stadium.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Skip Holtz played in 11 games at [[Notre Dame Stadium]] in 1986 and worked there as an assistant coach from 1990 to 1994.]]
Holtz's first job at his [[alma mater]] was to serve as wide receivers coach, and he filled the position for two years. In [[Notre Dame Fighting Irish football#Holtz era (1986<U+2013>1996)|1992]], the team began a search for a new [[offensive coordinator]]. Head coach Lou Holtz's first choice, Joe Moore, declined. Lou than asked Skip for recommendations to fill the position. Skip initially said he wanted the position, but Lou said, "he couldn't do it at that time with me [Skip] being his son."<ref name="ND Book"/> Skip then mentioned [[Mark Richt]], who was then the offensive coordinator at Florida State. Lou Holtz called Coach Bowden to ask permission to speak to Mark Richt.  Coach Bowden said Holtz could hire Richt as long as he could hire Skip. Coach Holtz said, "Well, if I'm just going to switch coaches, I might as well hire Skip."<ref name="ND Book"/> Skip became Notre Dame's offensive coordinator in 1992. Between 1992 and [[Notre Dame Fighting Irish football#Holtz era (1986<U+2013>1996)|1994]], Skip and his father recorded 40 wins, eight losses, and one tie, an 82.7% winning percentage. Together, they coached Notre Dame to the [[Cotton Bowl (game)|Cotton Bowl]] twice, beating [[Texas A&M Aggies football|Texas A&M]] both times. Skip had the third-best [[total offense]] in the NCAA during the [[1991 NCAA Division I-A football season|1991 football season]].<ref name="ND Book"/>

===University of Connecticut===

Following his success at Notre Dame, Skip Holtz was asked to become the head coach of the [[Connecticut Huskies]]. He accepted the offer and took his first head coaching job on [[December 23]], [[1993]]. He replaced Tom Jackson, who had gone 14&ndash;19 over the past three years and had decided to resign on [[November 17]], [[1993]].<ref>{{cite news | title = Jackson Resigns as Connecticut's Coach| publisher = The New York Times| date = 1993-11-18| url = http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F0CE2DF123CF93BA25752C1A965958260| accessdate = 2008-03-09}} </ref><ref>{{cite news | title = A Holtz for UConn?| publisher = The New York Times| date = 1993-12-23| url = http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F0CE5D6113FF931A15751C1A965958260| accessdate = 2008-03-09}}</ref> He agreed to a four-year contract at a salary of $95,000 a year. Even though Skip came from a "major football institution" (Notre Dame), University of Connecticut President Dr. Harry J. Hartley said that the hire "should not be seen as a signal that Connecticut intends to upgrade its program."<ref name="UConn"/>  Despite Hartley's remarks, Holtz planned to help elevate the team from [[Division I#Football Championship Subdivision|I-AA]] to I-A. Holtz commented on Hartley's remarks by saying "I'd love to have the opportunity to coach a Division I team here...."<ref>{{cite news | last = Cavanaugh| first = Jack| title =  A Winning Team (And Not Basketball)| publisher = The New York Times| date = 1998-11-08| url = http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9502E3DF163EF93BA35752C1A96E958260| accessdate = 2008-03-08}}</ref>  In 1998, UConn, after 100 years of football and five years with Skip Holtz as its head coach, played in its first Division I-AA playoff game. The Huskies scored two fourth-quarter touchdowns to beat Hampton University, 42&ndash;34.<ref>{{cite news | last = Cavanaugh| first = Jack| title = Sunshine on UConn's Shoulders in Playoffs| publisher = The New York Times| date = 1998-11-29| url = http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9800E3DB1139F93AA15752C1A96E958260| accessdate = 2008-03-09}}</ref> In the next round of the playoffs, the Huskies lost to the eventual champion, [[Georgia Southern Eagles football|Georgia Southern]], on December 5.  Two days later, Skip resigned as head coach of the Huskies in order to rejoin his father, who had taken the head coaching job at South Carolina the day before the Huskies' loss. As the leader of the Huskies football team, he accumulated a winning percentage of .596 (34&ndash;23) over five seasons.

===University of South Carolina===
[[Image:Lou Holtz cropped.jpg|left|100px|thumb|Skip Holtz's father, Lou]]
On [[December 4]], [[1998]], The University of South Carolina announced that Lou Holtz would serve as its next head football coach. Lou asked Skip if he would move down to Columbia to become his offensive coordinator<U+2014>the same position Skip held during his final two years at Notre Dame. Skip accepted the offer, in part due to a desire to live closer to his parents and so his children could spend more time with their grandparents.<ref name="Dadmag"/> In 1996, Skip's mother, Beth, was diagnosed with [[throat cancer]]. Two years later, the cancer spread to her [[liver cancer|liver]], [[lung cancer|lung]], [[adrenal cancer|adrenal glands]], and [[ovarian cancer|ovary]]. Meanwhile, Skip and Lou continued to coach football at South Carolina. As Lou began to struggle as head coach, the question of his eventual successor arose. When Skip was hired in 1998, Lou had included a clause in the hiring contract that Skip would succeed him after he retired. South Carolina Athletic Director rebutted by saying, "There are no formal or informal guarantees for him," and "It's always helpful to have potential succession in a staff."<ref>{{cite news | title = Skip Holtz To Join His Dad At S.C. | publisher = CBS Sportsline| date = 1998-12-07| url = http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/1998/12/07/archive/main24553.shtml| accessdate = 2008-03-09}}</ref>  

After going 5&ndash;7 over the previous two seasons and suffering season-ending blowout in 2003 by interstate rival [[Clemson Tigers football|Clemson]], Skip was demoted from the offensive coordinator and assistant head coaching positions to [[quarterbacks coach]]. Four assistant coaches<U+2014>including the team's [[defensive coordinator]]<U+2014>were fired in the same shakeup that saw Skip demoted.<ref>{{cite news | last = Haney| first = Travis| title = Holtz tries to change 'culture' | publisher = Augusta Chronicle| date = 2004-07-30| url = http://chronicle.augusta.com/stories/073004/usc_1604353.shtml| accessdate = 2008-03-09}}</ref> On [[November 22]], [[2004]], one season after Skip's demotion, Lou Holtz announced he was retiring as head coach of South Carolina.<ref>{{cite press release| title = Lou Holtz Announces Retirement From Coaching| publisher = Gamecocks Online| date = 2004-11-22| url = http://gamecocksonline.cstv.com/sports/m-footbl/spec-rel/112204aab.html| accessdate = 2008-03-09}}</ref> On the next day, South Carolina announced [[Steve Spurrier]] as the next head football coach.<ref>{{cite press release| title = Steve Spurrier Announced as New Head Football Coach at South Carolina| publisher = Gamecocks Online| date = 2004-11-23| url = http://gamecocksonline.cstv.com/sports/m-footbl/spec-rel/112304aak.html| accessdate = 2008-03-09}}</ref> Coach Spurrier announced that he was keeping only three members of Lou Holtz's staff.

===East Carolina University===

With his firing imminent, Holtz resigned. As a moderately successful college coach, Holtz had several offers from Division I-A and Division I-AA teams. After several interviews, he elected to take the head coaching position at [[East Carolina University]]. East Carolina announced Skip Holtz as their 19th head football coach on [[December 3]], [[2004]]. Holtz assumed control of a program that won just three games in its past 25 contests.<ref>{{cite news | last = Myatt| first = Al | title = Holtz the chosen one to resurrect program | publisher = Bonesville.net| date = 2004-12-03| url = http://www.bonesville.net/Articles/AlMyatt/2004/12/120304_Myatt.htm| accessdate = 2008-03-09}}</ref> Skip signed 23 athletes in his first recruiting class, including his first commit, Rob Kass.

Due to his success on the field, Coach Holtz was chosen to help lead the East team in the 2006 [[Hula Bowl]] at [[War Memorial Stadium]] in the town of [[Kahului, Hawai'i|Kahului]], [[Hawai'i]].<ref>{{cite news  | title = Hula Bowl: Central Florida's Marshall lead East to win| publisher = Associated Press | date = 2006-01-21| url = http://sports.espn.go.com/ncf/news/story?id=2301267| accessdate = 2008-03-09}}</ref>
