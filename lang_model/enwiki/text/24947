{{AFC comment|1=Hello! I'd like to see a handful of other sources to this, maybe if you can find some news articles or something like that and then just drop me a message on [[User talk:Kharkiv07|my talk page]]. I'm going to go ahead and mess with the formatting a bit, and hopefully we can get this to the level where I can accept it. :) '''''[[User:Kharkiv07|<span style="color: #000080">Kharkiv07</span>]][[User_talk:Kharkiv07|<span style="color: #FF0000"><sup>Talk</sup></span>]]''''' 21:09, 18 March 2015 (UTC)}}

'''Eric Sollee''' (8 September 1926 - 30 June 2008) was an American fencer and fencing coach. He fenced at [[Harvard]] earning NCAA [[All-America]] honors. He coached at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] (MIT), [[Harvard]] University, and the Carroll Center for the blind,<ref>''http://www.carroll.org ''</ref> among others. As a coach he is notable for helping to quickly develop competitive fencers and for a paradigm shift in how to fence against classical fencers. Sollee trained a number of top competitors including Olympians.

==Personal==

===Youth===
Eric Tennyson Sollee was born in [[Los Angeles, California]], to a Norwegian immigrant Father, Oben Sollee, and Filipino mother, Delores Sollee n<U+00E9>e Lichauco.<ref>http://www.lichaucofamily.com/HeritagePhotos.aspx</ref> During the [[Great Depression]] the family moved to the [[Philippines]] for work. Sollee was listed on his father's US passport while his sister was listed on his mother's Filipino passport. At age 14 he and his father were in the [[Santo Tomas Internment Camp]] in Manila, Philippines, a Japanese prisoner camp, for 3 years during [[World War II]]. After the war, Sollee joined the US Army and was in the 42nd Construction Engineer Battalion.<ref name="bryanmarquard">{{cite web|url=http://tech.mit.edu/V128/N36/sollee.html|title=Eric Sollee - The Tech|author=Bryan Marquard|work=mit.edu}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.legacy.com/obituaries/fosters/obituary.aspx?n=eric-tennyson-sollee&pid=113146094|title=Eric Sollee Obituary - Dover, NH - Fosters|work=Fosters}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.boston.com/news/local/articles/2005/03/20/a_point_of_balance?pg=full|title=Boston.com / News / Local / A point of balance|work=boston.com}}</ref>

===Fencing at Harvard===
After the Army, Sollee went to [[Harvard|Harvard University]]. At Harvard, he picked up fencing quickly and was made captain of the freshman team, even without prior fencing experience. He learned to fence from [[Ren<U+00E9> Peroy]], Harvard fencing coach, European [[sabre]] champion, and member of the 1924 US Olympic fencing team.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thecrimson.com/article/1952/2/6/rene-peroy-pconnoisseurs-of-fine-wines/|title=Rene Peroy|work=thecrimson.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.museumofamericanfencing.com/site/index.php/foil-fencing/mens-foil/118-1928-amsterdam-games-foil-fencers|title=1928 Amsterdam Games Foil Fencers|work=museumofamericanfencing.com}}</ref>His other coach, [[Joseph Levis]], was the second ranked in the world in foil and silver medalist at the 1932 Olympics.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.museumofamericanfencing.com/site/index.php/fencing-history/wise-words/153-its-all-in-the-fingers|title=It's all in the fingers|author=Shaw, Andy}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://usfencinghalloffame.com/roll-of-honor/417-levis-joseph|title=Levis, Joe|author=Administrator|work=usfencinghalloffame.com}}</ref>

Sollee captained the Harvard team in 1951-52 and earned a varsity letter in 1952. With his support, [[Harvard_Crimson_fencing|Harvard's fencing team]] went 6-1 overall and finished 14th at the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] Championships in 1952. Sollee placed fifth in the foil at the NCAA Championships, earning [[All-America]] honors. In one [[Amateur Fencers League of America]] tournament, he won all three divisions - [[foil (fencing)|foil]], [[<U+00E9>p<U+00E9>e]], and [[sabre]]. He also won the Greater [[Boston]] Open Foils Championship. He was inducted into the Harvard Athletic Hall of Fame in 1999.<ref name="harvardvarsityclub.org">{{cite web|url=https://www.harvardvarsityclub.org/article.html?aid=647|title=Harvard Varsity Club|work=harvardvarsityclub.org}}</ref><ref name="bryanmarquard"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thecrimson.com/article/1952/3/29/sollee-leads-fencers-in-ncaa-tourney/|title=Sollee Leads Fencers In N.C.A.A.

==Professional==

===Coaching at MIT===
At [[MIT]], Sollee started as the assistant fencing coach and the women's team first fencing coach under the direction of [[Edwin Richards (fencer)|Edwin Richards]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://usfencinghalloffame.com/roll-of-honor/449-richards-edwin|title=Richards, Edwin|author=Administrator|work=usfencinghalloffame.com}}</ref> [[Edo Marion]], Silvio Vitale,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://museumofamericanfencing.com/site/index.php/fencing-history/great-coaches/69-vitale-sylvio|title=Vitale, Sylvio|author=Administrator|work=museumofamericanfencing.com}}</ref> and Branimir Zivkovic. Sollee initiated and developed the MIT women's fencing program. When Vitale retired, Sollee became head coach and Maitre d'armes at MIT.<ref name="harvardvarsityclub.org"/>

Because MIT doesn't recruit or offer scholarships in fencing, Sollee was charged with teaching students who typically had little to no experience fencing.<ref name="bryanmarquard"/>

In developing his approaches to teaching and fencing, Sollee used his understanding of a wide range of subjects, including boxing, martial arts and psychology, and his experience teaching fencing to the blind at the Carroll Center. Sollee taught well over a thousand students at the Carroll Center helping people regain their orientation in space.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://carroll.org/services/campus-and-community-rehabilitation/eric-sollee/|title=Eric Sollee|work=The Carroll Center for the Blind}}</ref> As part of the effort to work on teaching approaches, Sollee and [[Johan Harmenberg]] came up with a new way to think about [[<U+00E9>p<U+00E9>e]] fencing starting with the three "Sollee conjectures". Sollee and his students collaboratively worked on these conjectures and the associated new paradigm. Harmenberg implemented these ideas and won both the [[World Fencing Championships]] and the [[Olympic gold medal]] in [[<U+00E9>p<U+00E9>e]] at the [[Fencing at the 1980 Summer Olympics|1980 Summer Olympics]]. It also worked for those who learned and helped to further develop Sollee's ideas by working with Johan Harmenberg away from MIT, e.g. [[Bj<U+00F6>rne V<U+00E4>gg<U+00F6>]], who won the Silver medal in ep<U+00E9>e in the 1984 Olympics.<ref name="Harmenberg2007" /><ref>http://fs.ncaa.org/Docs/NCAANewsArchive/1983/19831114.pdf</ref><ref name="Harmenberg2007">{{cite book|author=Johan Harmenberg|title=Epee 2. 0: The Birth of the New Fencing Paradigm|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=PGABIAAACAAJ|date=1 October 2007|publisher=SKA SwordPlay Books|isbn=978-0-9789022-1-6}}</ref>

===The Sollee Conjectures===
During Sollee's time at MIT, he and his students developed The Sollee Conjectures, which are now widley used as the basis for modern <U+00E9>p<U+00E9>e teaching.

The three conjectures are:
# Is it possible for the fencer with the lower technical ability to decide the technical level of a bout?
# Can the fencer with the shorter fencing distance control the distance in a bout?
# Is it possible to force your opponent into your own area of greatest strength?<ref name="Harmenberg2007" />
