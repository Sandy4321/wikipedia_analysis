The release also charted atop the charts of Australia and Canada and reached the top five charts of Denmark, New Zealand, Norway, Sweden and Switzerland.

The album spawned four [[single (music)|singles]]. Its lead single, "[[Chandelier (Sia song)|Chandelier]]", which was released in March 2014, became a worldwide top-ten single. It also peaked at number 8 on the US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], becoming the first song by Sia to enter the chart as a lead artist. The follow-up singles, "[[Eye of the Needle (song)|Eye of the Needle]]" and "[[Big Girls Cry]]", were released in June 2014. Sia's solo version of "[[Elastic Heart#Sia solo version|Elastic Heart]]", which was originally a collaboration with [[The Weeknd]] and [[Diplo]], was released in January 2015.

To promote the project, Sia appears on a number of TV shows including ''[[The Ellen DeGeneres Show]]'' and ''[[Jimmy Kimmel Live!]]'', where she recruited [[Maddie Ziegler]] as her persona onstage, during 2014 and 2015. ''1000 Forms of Fear'' earned Sia three [[ARIA Music Awards]] in [[ARIA Music Awards of 2014|2014]] and was listed as one of the best albums of 2014 by several publications including ''[[The Boston Globe]]'' and ''[[Rolling Stone]]''.

Writing for [[Slant Magazine]], Annie Galvin opined that ''1000 Forms of Fear'' "should be the vessel that rockets the singer out of relative obscurity and into the stratosphere populated by those more recognizable stars who've come to dominate the pop-music universe thanks, in part, to her songwriting skills."<ref name="Slant"/> Mikael Wood writing for the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' praised Sia's vocals and the production held by [[Greg Kurstin]].<ref name="LATimes"/> Likewise, ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]''{{'}}s Adam Markovitz positively viewed Sia's voice as "astonishing," giving the album a B score.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ew.com/article/2014/08/26/1000-forms-fear|title=1000 Forms of Fear|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|first=Adam |last=Markovitz|date=26 August 2014|accessdate=19 February 2015}}</ref> On a less enthusiastic review, ''[[The Guardian]]'' Harriet Gibsone shared that the album was so impeccable and "contemporary-sounding" that "its impact may fade with time."<ref name="Guardian"/> ''[[The A.V.
