The '''Grammy Award for Best Hawaiian Music Album''' was an honor presented to recording artists from 2005 to 2011 for quality [[Music of Hawaii|Hawaiian music]] albums. The [[Grammy Award]]s, an annual ceremony that was established in 1958 and originally called the Gramophone Awards,<ref name=Grammy>{{cite news|url=http://theenvelope.latimes.com/awards/grammys/env-grammy_awards_info,0,5279018.htmlstory?track=center|title=Grammy Awards at a Glance|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|publisher=[[Tribune Company]]|accessdate=January 12, 2011}}</ref> are presented by the [[National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences]] of the United States to "honor artistic achievement, technical proficiency and overall excellence in the recording industry, without regard to album sales or chart position".<ref name=Overview>{{cite web|url=http://www.grammy.org/recording-academy|title=Overview|accessdate=May 31, 2011|publisher=[[National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences]]}}</ref>

Campaigning resulted in the Hawaiian category's establishment in 2005. Prior to its creation, Hawaiian music recordings were eligible for the [[Grammy Award for Best World Music Album|Best World Music Album]] category but no Hawaiian musician or group had ever won a Grammy Award. During its seven-year history, awards were presented to Charles M. Brotman for ''Slack Key Guitar: Volume 2'', producers [[Daniel Ho]], Paul Konwiser and Wayne Wong for ''Masters of Hawaiian Slack Key Guitar: Volume One'', the same production team plus George Kahumoku, Jr. for ''Legends of Hawaiian Slack Key Guitar: Live from Maui'' in 2007 followed by ''Treasures of Hawaiian Slack Key Guitar'' in 2008 and ''Masters of Hawaiian Slack Key Guitar: Volume 2'' in 2010, [[Tia Carrere]] and Ho for ''Ikena'', and Carrere for ''Huana Ke Aloha'' in 2011. Eligible recordings must feature the [[Hawaiian language]] on "more than half of its vocal tracks", though [[instrumental]] albums are also acceptable.<ref name=Chinen>{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/06/arts/music/06danielho.html|title=Dear Grammy, Is It Hawaiian Enough?|first=Nate|last=Chinen|date=February 4, 2011|accessdate=May 11, 2011|work=[[The New York Times]]|publisher=[[The New York Times Company]]|pages=1<U+2013>2}}</ref> Awards were presented to the [[Audio engineering|engineers]], [[Audio mixing (recorded music)|mixers]], and/or [[Record producer|producers]] in addition to the performing artists.

Daniel Ho holds the record for the most wins, with five. Four-time recipients include Paul Konwiser and Wayne Wong as producers. George Kahumoku, Jr. earned three awards as a producer and Tia Carrere earned two as a performing artist. Ho also holds the record for the most nominations, with seven. [[Amy Gilliom|Amy Hanaiali'i Gilliom]] holds the record for the most nominations without a win, with five. Six of the seven Grammy-winning albums were released through the record label Daniel Ho Creations. In 2011, the Recording Academy announced the retirement of the award category. Beginning in 2012, Hawaiian music recordings will be eligible for the [[Grammy Award for Best Regional Roots Music Album|Best Regional Roots Music Album]] category.

==Background==
For decades prior to the creation of the Best Hawaiian Music Album category, advocates for Hawaiian music took issue with recordings only being eligible for the [[Grammy Award for Best World Music Album|Best World Music Album]] category.<ref name=Chinen/> Advocates included musicians, record labels, government officials, and the [[Seattle]]-based Pacific Northwest Chapter of the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences.<ref name=Ogunnaike>{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2005/02/12/arts/music/12hawa.html|title=A Grammy Hawaii Can Call Its Own|first=Lola|last=Ogunnaike|date=February 12, 2005|accessdate=May 19, 2011|work=The New York Times|publisher=The New York Times Company}}</ref><ref name=SPI>{{cite news|url=http://www.seattlepi.com/default/article/Charles-album-takes-eight-but-Keys-West-and-1166357.php#page-2|title=Charles' album takes eight, but Keys, West and Usher win, too|first=Gene|last=Stout|date=February 13, 2005|page=2|accessdate=May 19, 2011|work=[[Seattle Post-Intelligencer]]}}</ref> No Hawaiian musician or group had been awarded with a Grammy prior to the establishment of the Hawaiian Music category.<ref name=deBarros>{{cite news|url=http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/localnews/2002178859_grammy13.html|title=Music biz hitting crescendo in the Northwest|first=Paul|last=de Barros|work=[[The Seattle Times]]|publisher=[[The Seattle Times Company]]|date=February 13, 2005|accessdate=May 19, 2011}}</ref> One obstacle for the category's creation was defining Hawaiian music and the eligibility requirements in terms of music stylings and language restrictions.<ref name=Ogunnaike/> There has been conflict between traditional and Western-influenced Hawaiian music, mostly pertaining to use of the [[slack-key guitar]], an instrument invented in [[Hawaii]] but commercialized by "mainlanders". According to Academy representative Bill Freimuth, the category was designed "for recordings of a more traditional nature".<ref name=Chinen/> Requiring the use of [[Hawaiian language]] on more than half of its vocal tracks encouraged the recognition of traditional music,<ref name=Ogunnaike/> but [[instrumental]] albums (such as the [[compilation album]] honored at the [[47th Grammy Awards]]) circumvented this requirement.<ref name=Chinen/>
