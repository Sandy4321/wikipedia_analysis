The '''McDonnell Douglas AV-8B Harrier II''' is a family of second-generation vertical/short takeoff and landing or ''[[V/STOL]]'' [[turbofan|jet]] [[multirole aircraft]] of the late 20th century. [[British Aerospace]] rejoined the project in the early  1980s,  and it is currently managed by [[Boeing]]/[[BAE Systems]] since the 1990s. 

Developed from the earlier [[Hawker Siddeley Harrier]]s, it is primarily used for light attack or multi-role tasks, typically operated from small [[aircraft carrier]]s. Versions are used by several [[NATO]] countries, including the [[United Kingdom]], [[Spain]], [[Italy]], and the [[United States]].

Though it shares the designation letter number with the earlier AV-8 Harrier, the AV-8B Harrier II was extensively redesigned by McDonnell Douglas.

==Overview==
[[Image:BAE-McDonell-Douglas AV8B-01.jpg|thumb|250px|AV-8B at Oshkosh 2003]]
The aircraft is known as the '''AV-8B Harrier II''' in [[USMC]] service and the '''[[BAE Harrier II|Harrier GR7/GR9]]''' in RAF service. The '''AV-8A''' was a previous-generation [[Hawker Siddeley Harrier#Harrier GR.1A|Hawker Siddeley Harrier GR.1A]] procured for the [[United States Marine Corps|US Marine Corps]]. It is commonly referred to as the Harrier Jump-jet.

The AV-8 is sometimes alleged to be non-systematic to the [[1962 United States Tri-Service aircraft designation system]], however these claims are questionable (note the DoD is free not to follow the guidelines of its own system regardless). AV-8 is not technically wrong, because it is correct for the basic mission letter (A) to go ''before'' the vehicle type (V). However, instead of being part of the V- series, its part of the A- number series (there was a previous Ryan [[XV-8 Fleep]]), because A is not a modified mission letter but a basic mission. Reversing it would also be wrong since a V- is a vehicle type, not a basic mission letter. V is also a modified mission letter, but it is for staff transport- VA would mean a fixed-wing attack aircraft used for staff transport. Normal fixed wing aircraft do not have vehicle type indicator like (V) to the right of their basic mission beause no vehicle type indicator means it is a fixed wing aircraft vehicle type.

It might have been the "AV-12" designation (with A as a modified mission, not basic mission letter), but that was eventually taken up by the [[Rockwell International|Rockwell]] [[Rockwell XFV-12|XFV-12]] fighter, which was canceled with the [[Sea Control Ship]] it was supposed to deploy aboard. However, using the V- series is debatable since the aircraft's attack role is a basic mission not a modifed mission. 

For the amount of redesign over the AV-8A Harrier, it could have easily been given a new number code (such as AV-16), but DoD standards on a new numbers for aircraft families vary widely.

==History==
The '''Harrier II''' is notable as an example of US-UK cooperation and of [[Cold War]] defense achievements. Of note is the U.S aid funding early development of the [[Hawker P.1127]] under the [[Mutual Weapons Development Program]] (MWDP), and the salvaging of what was left of the '''AV-16 Advanced Harrier Program''' by McDonnell Douglas, making the second-generation family possible.

McDonnell Douglas was restarted its own program which was nearing production status when British Aerospace rejoined the program in the 1980s. They then jointly produced the aircraft, and BAe developed second generation Harriers from the aircraft. By the 1990s McDonnell Douglas bought by Boeing, and BAe was merged into Bae Systems who went on to manage the family into the early 21st century.

===Development===
The AV-8B had its direct origins in a Joint British-U.S. project (Hawker-Siddeley and McDonnell Douglas Aircraft) for a much-improved [[Hawker Siddeley Harrier|Harrier]] aircraft, the AV-16. However cost over-runs in engine development on the part of [[Rolls-Royce Limited|Rolls Royce]] and in the aircraft development caused the British to pull out of the program. 
Interest remained in the U.S. so a less ambitious, though still expensive project was undertaken by McDonnell on their own catered to U.S. needs.  Using things learned from AV-16 development, though dropping some things such as further Pegasus development, the development work continued leading to the AV-8B for the U.S. Marine Corps. The aircraft was centered on the Marines' need for a light ground attack airplane and focused on payload and range as opposed to speed. In the early 1980s, the British restarted development of their own second generation Harrier based on the U.S. design which led eventually to the GR.5. 

The first two YAV-8B prototypes were converted from existing AV-8A airframes.

===Manufacture===
Aircraft were built by [[McDonnell Douglas]] and [[British Aerospace]] (later [[BAE Systems]]), the latter at their Kingston & Dunsfold facilities in Surrey, in the [[United Kingdom|UK]]. The factories were also home to the [[Hawker Hunter]], and [[BAE Hawk|BAe Hawk T1]].

==Variants==
[[Image:Asturias-VGG.jpg|thumb|300px| A Spanish Navy AV-8 Harrier II Plus taking off from the Ski-Jump ramp on the aircraft-carrier ''Pr<U+00ED>ncipe de Asturias'']]
Several variants of the Harrier are used by four countries' military forces. The [[Royal Air Force]] and [[Fleet Air Arm]] of the [[United Kingdom]] operate a number of variants and versions starting in the late 1980s, including the GR7/7A, GR9/9A, T10 and T12 versions. ('''see [[RAF Harrier II]]'''). The [[United States Marine Corps]] has operated the '''McDonnell Douglas AV-8B''' and '''TAV-8B''' since 1985. The [[Spanish Navy|Spanish Naval air wing]] (''Arma Aerea De La Armada'') operates the AV-8B+ and AV-8B, as well as a TAV-8S Harrier I. The [[Marina Militare|Italian Navy air wing]] (''Aviazione per la Marina Militare'') also uses the AV-8B+ and TAV-8B. Harrier variants can vary significantly depending on the exact model, even among a single country's aircraft. 

===AV-8B Harrier II===
The first '''AV-8B Harrier II'''s produced were commonly known as the "Day Attack" variant, and are no longer in service. Most were upgraded to ''Night Attack Harrier'' or ''Harrier II Plus'' standards, with the remainder being withdrawn from service.

Fielded in 1991, the '''Night Attack Harrier''' incorporated a Navigation Forward Looking Infrared camera (NAVFLIR). The cockpit was also upgraded, including compatibility with night vision goggles. Concurrent with the new version of the aircraft was introduced a more powerful Rolls Royce Pegasus II engine. It was originally intended to be designated AV-8D.<ref name="Donald">Donald, David: ''Modern Battlefield Warplanes'', page 89. AIRtime Publishing Inc, 2004. ISBN 1-880588-76-5</ref>

The '''Harrier II Plus''' is very similar to the Night Attack variant, with the addition of an APG-65 radar (the same as in early F/A-18 Hornets) in an extended nose, making it capable of operating advanced missiles such as the [[AIM-120 AMRAAM]]. Used by USMC, Spanish Navy, and Italian Navy.

===AV-8C Harrier===
An upgraded version developed from the AV-8A model as an interim pending delivery of the AV-8B. The airframe was not based on the AV-8B Harrier II.

===TAV-8B Harrier II===
A two-seat trainer version.

===EAV-8B Matador II===
Spanish Navy version.
