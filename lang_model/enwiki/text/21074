A '''cong you bing''' ([[wikt:<U+8471><U+6CB9><U+997C>|<U+8471><U+6CB9><U+997C>]]) or '''green onion pancake''' is a [[Basic taste|savoury]], non-[[Leavening agent|leavened]] [[flatbread]] folded with [[cooking oil|oil]] and minced [[scallion]]s (green onions). It originates in [[Chinese culture]]. Unlike a true [[pancake]], it is made from [[dough]] instead of [[batter (cooking)|batter]]. Variations exist on the basic method of preparation that incorporate other flavors and fillings (see below).

Green onion pancakes are available in [[China]], [[Taiwan]], and other areas of the world with ethnic Chinese populations, in restaurants and as a [[street food]] item, and is also commercially available packaged fresh or [[frozen food|frozen]] solid in plastic packages (often in [[Asian supermarket]]s).

==Variations and accompaniments==
Other ingredients, such as chopped [[fennel]] greens and [[sesame]] seeds are sometimes added with the green onions.   In some variants, green onions may be omitted and replaced by another filling of choice such as [[maize|corn]] and diced bell peppers.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}} 

Another method for cooking green onion pancakes is to fry them with eggs coated on one side.  There is another snack found in Chinese culture called the ''egg pancake'' (<U+86CB><U+9905>), which is almost identical to the green onion pancake except that the dough of the egg pancake is thinner and moister.

A similar pancake may be made with [[garlic chives]] (''jiucai'') instead of scallions. Such a pancake is called a ''jiucai bing'' (<U+97ED><U+83DC><U+997C>) or ''jiucai you bing'' (<U+97ED><U+83DC><U+6CB9><U+997C>).

One variation involves leavening the dough and not flattening up the coil into a pancake.  The coil is then fried or baked into a bread.

In [[North America]], the pancakes are often served with [[soy sauce]], hot [[chili sauce]], or [[Vietnamese dipping sauce]].

A Chinese dessert, the ''red bean pancake'' (<U+8C46><U+6C99><U+934B><U+9905>), is a variant in which green onions and salt are replaced with a sweet [[red bean paste]].

==Chinese legend surrounding the invention of pizza==
{{Main|History of pizza}}
There is a legend in China a belief that [[pizza]] is an evolution of green onion pancake, brought back to Italy by [[Marco Polo]]. Here is one version of the legend:<ref>Xinhua, 12 September 2007, ''Pizza and Ice Cream: The Chinese Delicacies Marco Polo Brought Back to the West (Chinese)'' http://big5.xinhuanet.com/gate/big5/news.xinhuanet.com/overseas/2007-09/12/content_6707259.htm</ref> <blockquote>Marco Polo missed green onion pancakes so much that when he was back in Italy, he tried to find chefs willing to make the pancake for him.  One day, he managed to meet a chef from [[Naples]] at a friend's dinner party and persuaded him to try recreating the dish. After half a day without success, Marco Polo suggested the filling be put at the top rather than inside the dough.  The change, by chance, created a dish praised by everyone at the party.  The chefs returned to Naples and improvised by adding cheese and other ingredients and formed today's pizza.</blockquote>

However, modern research in Europe proves that neither pizza nor pasta were transmitted to Europe by Marco Polo, but existed in the Mediterranean long before the time of Marco Polo.<ref>''The History Of Pizza'' http://www.thenibble.com/REVIEWS/MAIN/pastas/fall-pizza-recipes.asp</ref><ref>''Global Gourmet/Italy'' http://library.thinkquest.org/05aug/01177/eng/italy.html</ref><ref>''However, in the ruins of Pompeii, archaeologists have uncovered what appear to be pasta-making devices. In addition, macaroni is mentioned in writings from as early as 1200--long before Marco Polo's journeys.'' http://www.eurotravelling.net/italy/pompeii/pompeii_culture.htm</ref><ref>''The Food Timeline: Marco Polo'' http://www.foodtimeline.org/foodfaq3.html#venice</ref> Pizza is supposed to be a Greek or Mesopotamian invention.<ref>''The History Of Pizza'' http://www.thenibble.com/REVIEWS/MAIN/pastas/fall-pizza-recipes.asp</ref> Furthermore, the first recorded use of the word "pizza" dates from 997 AD (in a Latin text from the town of Gaeta in southern Italy<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.yourdictionary.com/library/pizza.html |title=Dictionary & Thesaurus - YourDictionary |publisher=YourDictionary |date= |accessdate=2009-06-05}}</ref>), more than 250 years before [[Marco Polo]] was born.
