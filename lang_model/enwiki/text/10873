'''Kristiansand Airport, Kjevik''' ({{lang-no|Kristiansand lufthavn, Kjevik}}; {{Airport codes|KRS|ENCN|p=n}}) is an [[international airport]] serving [[Kristiansand]], [[Norway]]. The [[airport]] is located at [[Tveit]], {{convert|16|km|sp=us}} by road and {{convert|8|km|sp=us}} by air from the city center. Operated by the state-owned [[Avinor]], it is the sole airport in [[Agder]] with scheduled flights. Kjevik has a {{convert|2035|m|sp=us|adj=on}} [[runway]] aligned 04/22 and served 1,065,615 passengers in 2013. Scheduled flights are provided by [[Scandinavian Airlines]], [[Norwegian Air Shuttle]], [[Wider<U+00F8>e]], [[KLM Cityhopper]] and [[Wizz Air]]. The [[Royal Norwegian Air Force]] has a training center at the airport.

Kjevik opened on 1 June 1939, as the joint second airport in the country. During the [[Second World War]] it was occupied and expanded by the [[Luftwaffe]]. Kristiansand's southerly location caused the airport to receive several international routes during the early years, as well as domestic services. [[Braathens SAFE]] served domestic services from 1955 to its demise in 2004. [[KLM]] flew until 1971, after which [[Dan-Air]] opened routes to the United Kingdom. The terminal received major extensions in 1955, 1979, 1994 and 2015. New control towers were built in 1966 and 2013. Kjevik was the base for [[S<U+00F8>rfly]] from 1946 to 1962, for [[Agderfly]] from 1969 to 2004, and for [[FlyNonstop]] in 2013.

==History==
===Construction===
The first airport in Kristiansand was a [[water aerodrome]] situated in the city center. It was built by the [[Royal Norwegian Navy Air Service]] in 1918.<ref>Hafsten & Arheim: 38</ref> A government commission recommended on 21 October 1920 that Kristiansand receive a water airport as part of a nation-wide investment program. However, nothing came of the plans for more than a decade.<ref name=o9>Olsen-Hagen & Gulstad: 9</ref> Moving of the military water aerodrome was proposed several times, although this was never carried out before the construction of Kjevik.<ref>Hafsten & Arheim: 39</ref>

Locally the initiative for an airport in Kristiansand was launched by Mayor Andreas Kj<U+00E6>r in 1933. The city council sent a formal application to the government in August 1934 asking for an airport.<ref>Bakken: 21</ref> That summer Wider<U+00F8>e commenced flights to Kristiansand along a coastal route from [[Oslo]] to [[Haugesund]].<ref>Bakken: 22</ref> [[Norwegian Air Lines]] (DNL) commenced a coastal seaplane route along the southern coast from [[Oslo]] to [[Bergen]] via Kristiansandon 9 June 1935. This service used an aerodrome at Kongsg<U+00E5>rdbukta.<ref>Bakken: 13</ref>

The government stated in 1935 that it planned on building a main airport for Agder <U+2013> Kristiansand, [[Mandal]] and [[Arendal]] were all proposed as suitable hosts. The government concluded that Kristiansand was the most suitable, based on traffic, military and financial considerations. Several locations were considered. Kongsg<U+00E5>rdbakken was selected, costing 2 million [[Norwegian krone]] (NOK) less than Kjevik.<ref name=o11>Olsen-Hagen & Gulstad: 11</ref> The municipality and the state formalized construction in April 1936, where the former would provide the land and the construction costs of NOK&nbsp;2.4 million would be split. Construction commenced soon afterwards.<ref>Bakken: 23</ref>

Meanwhile a group started looking at Kjevik as a suitable site, led by aviator [[Bernt Balchen]], industrialist Rolf Petersen and Lawyer Hartmann.<ref>Bakken: 24</ref> They presented detailed plans and agreed prices for purchase of lands. Based on this Kristiansand Municipal Council accepted on 5 August 1936 to reconsider Kjevik. Kjevik was passed in the council on 30 September 1937 with 34 against 26 votes.<ref>Bakken: 25</ref> Construction commenced in November and was contracted to H<U+00F8>yer-Ellefsen. The same year the [[Norwegian Army Air Service]] used the fields at Kjevik for training.<ref name=o11 />

The airport originally consisted of a {{convert|1000|by|40|m|sp=us|adj=on}} concrete runway connected to the apron with a {{convert|12|m|sp=us|adj=on}} wide [[taxiway]]. A small, wooden terminal building was built of a shed and a near-by residential house was used as a restaurant. Seaplanes were served with a floating dock and a [[slipway]]. Kjevik opened on 1 June 1939, the same day as [[Oslo Airport, Fornebu]]. The first aircraft to land was a [[Douglas DC-2]] of [[KLM]]. They started an international route from Oslo via Kristiansand to [[Amsterdam]], while [[Danish Air Lines]] operated to [[Copenhagen]]. DNL opened a domestic seaplane route from Oslo via Kristiansand to [[Stavanger Airport, Sola]].<ref name=o12>Olsen-Hagen & Gulstad: 12</ref>

===Second World War===
Kjevik was captured by the [[Luftwaffe]] during the [[Operation Weser<U+00FC>bung|German invasion]] on 9 April 1940. The first aircraft landed at Kjevik as an emergency landing on the first day of the occupation.<ref>Bakken: 15</ref> Later it was used for [[Junkers Ju 52]] transport planes,<ref name=b16>Bakken: 16</ref> using to fly in troops.<ref name=o12 /> From 11 April a squadron of [[Messerschmitt Bf 109]] were stationed at Kjevik.<ref>Hafsten: 79</ref>

Luftwaffe immediately started upgrading the aerodrome. They started by removing a hill at the east end of the runway, followed by an extension of the runway. Tveit was transformed with military structures built throughout the village. In the east a minefield was laid and several fuel tanks were built around the airfield. Two large hangars were built and a large number of sheds.<ref name=b16 /> In the course of the war the runway was extended to {{convert|1580|m|sp=us}}.<ref name=o12 /> The German military planned a large expansion of the airport from 1945, which would have included new aprons and would have obliterated the village. These plans were halted by the [[end of World War II in Europe|end of the war]].<ref name=b16 />

===Early operation===
[[File:KLM Cityhopper F50 PH-KVA.jpg|thumb|[[Fokker 50]] of [[KLM Cityhopper]] at Kjevik in 2000]]
Kjevik was taken over by the [[Royal Air Force]] in May 1945. They started the work of mine sweeping and disarming the armaments and general clean-up of the aerodrome. It was later transferred to civilian use.<ref name=b17>Bakken: 17</ref> The Air Force's Aircraft-Technical School and the Weapon-Technical School moved to Kjevik in February 1946. The latter moved to [[Lista Air Station]] two years later.<ref name=b10>Bakken: 10</ref>

The upgraded facilities resulted in Kristiansand Municipality wanted to rid itself of the responsibility and cost of running the airport. The city council passed a resolution of 9 December 1946 offering the airport free of charge to the state.<ref name=o13>Olsen-Hagen & Gulstad: 13</ref> This was approved by Parliament on 20 June 1947.<ref name=b17 /> The same year the aviation club Kjevik Flyklubb was established.<ref>Bakken: 59</ref>

On 6 March 1946 KLM resumed its route, flying from Oslo via Kristiansand to Amsterdam using a [[Douglas DC-3]]. By 1950 it was flown three times a week, and continued onwards to [[Brussels]].<ref>Bakken: 47</ref> DNL, through the [[Scandinavian Airlines System]] (SAS) cooperation started an international route on 2 October 1946 from Oslo via Kristiansand, Amsterdam and Brussels to [[Paris]]. Four days later a domestic Ju 52 seaplane route from Kristiansand to Stavanger, Haugesund and Bergen. Danish Air Lines introduced a route from Kjevik to [[Aalborg]] and Copenhagen in 1947.<ref>Bakken: 50</ref>

DNL started a land plane route from Kristiansand to Stavanger in 1947, but withdrew two years later,<ref name=o13 /> using a [[Douglas DC-3]].<ref>Bakken: 51</ref> From 1949 KLM took over flights from Oslo to Kristiansand.<ref name=o13 /> [[Braathens SAFE]] was awarded the route in 1950, along with an extension to Copenhagen, but abandoned it the following year.<ref name=b52>Bakken: 52</ref> The terminal building was expanded in 1953, receiving a new waiting room and a new cafeteria.<ref name=o14>Olsen-Hagen & Gulstad: 14</ref>

S<U+00F8>rfly<U+2014>the first airline based in Agder<U+2014>was established in 1946. It operated out of Kjevik, originally with the [[Auster Autocrat]]s. They performed various [[general aviation]] tasks, including sight-seeing, charter flights for hunters, especially to [[Setesdal]] and [[aerial photography]].<ref>Bakken: 54</ref> A [[Republic Seabee]] and a [[Miles Gemini]] were delivered in 1947 and 1948. The airline launched a scheduled route from Stavanger and Kristiansand via <U+00C5>lborg to [[Gothenburg]].<ref>Bakken: 55</ref> The airline's hangar at Kjevik collapsed in 1954 and the Seabee sold in 1956. From then the airline had less and less activity and liquidated in 1962.<ref>Bakken: 56</ref>

Braathens resumed traffic on 6 June 1955 when it opened a route from Oslo via [[T<U+00F8>nsberg]], Kristiansand and [[Farsund]] to Stavanger, with a daily round trip on a [[de Havilland Heron]]. These were replaced with the larger [[Fokker F27 Friendship]] in 1959. The route served 2,593 passengers the first year, increasing to 17,900 in 1960. Braathens opened a route from Kristiansand to <U+00C5>lborg in 1960, although this was taken over by SAS the following year.<ref name=b52 /> That year the airport had 54,306 passengers.<ref name=o24>Olsen-Hagen & Gulstad: 24</ref>

KLM introduced the [[Vickers Viscount]] on the Kjevik route in 1957 and three years later started using the [[Lockheed L-188 Electra]].<ref name=b48>Bakken: 48</ref> The Weapon Technical School moved back to Kjevik in 1963.<ref name=b10 /> During the late 1950s and 1960s SAS switched its Kristiansand services first to the [[Saab Scandia]] and then the [[Convair 240|Convair CV-440 Metropolitan]].<ref name=b51>Bakken: 51</ref> [[Dan-Air]] introduced summer services to [[Newcastle-upon-Tyne]] from 1963, expanded to an all-year service from 1972.<ref name=b53>Bakken: 53</ref>

[[File:LN-SUD Kjevik 1977-10-31.JPG|thumb|An accident from [[Braathens SAFE]] [[Boeing 737-200]] in 1977]]
New aircraft resulted in the need for a longer runway. The city and the state made an agreement whereby the former would pay for the land while the latter would pay for the construction. The runway was extended to {{convert|1960|m|sp=us}} in 1966. On 2 November a new, {{convert|18|m|sp=us|adj=on}} tall [[control tower]] opened.<ref name=o14 /> The airport had 143,585 passengers in 1965.<ref name=o24 />

Agderfly was established at Kjevik in 1969. The company operated a wide range of aircraft, focusing until the 1980s exclusively as a flying school.<ref>Bakken: 57</ref> KLM introduced the [[Douglas DC-9]] on the Amsterdam route from 1966. However, the stopped serving Kristiansand from November 1971, when the stop was moved to Gothenburg.<ref name=b48 /> Braathens introduced the [[Fokker F28 Fellowship]] from 1969 and the [[Boeing 737|Boeing 737-200]] from 1975.<ref name=b52 />

The airport served 203,875 passengers in 1970, which increased to 295,578 five years later.<ref name=o24 /> A parachute club, Kjevik Fallskjermklubb, was founded in 1974.<ref>Bakken: 60</ref> Dan-Air introduced a service to London in 1976.<ref name=b53 /> The Air Force's Communication- and Radar School moved to Kjevik in 1977.<ref name=b10 /> SAS used the DC-9 for its international route for a period during the 1970s, but as these proved too large later switched to the smaller F27.<ref name=b51 />

===New terminal===
[[File:Kristiansand Airport Kjevik entrance.jpg|thumb|The terminal land side in 1999 showing the 1979 terminal (left), the 1953 terminal and the 1966 tower]]

Kristiansand was one of six test airports which received a British doppler [[microwave landing system]] in 1977.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Routes |work=[[Flight International]] |date=29 October 1977 |page=1250 |url=http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1977/1977%20-%203232.html |accessdate=27 December 2014}}</ref>  The the late 1970s the terminal was too small, resulting in the airport opening a new {{convert|3500|m2|sp=us|adj=on}} terminal on 22 March 1979, costing NOK&nbsp;19 million. The terminal from the war had been used for domestic services and was converted to cargo terminal. The international terminal was converted to a terminal for the Air Force.<ref name=o14 /> Kjevik served 400,549 passengers in 1980, increasing to 477,549 five years later.<ref name=o24 />

Kristiansand-based Agderfly introduced services to [[G<U+00F6>teborg Landvetter Airport]] on 26 September 1989, followed by a [[Billund Airport]] route on 2 October.<ref>{{cite news |title=Nye flyruter fra Kjevik |last=Oftedal |first=Hallgeir |work=[[Dagens N<U+00E6>ringsliv]] |date=18 December 1989 |page=12 |language=Norwegian}}</ref> Two years later they received permission to fly to [[Bremen Airport]],<ref>{{cite news |title=Agderfly f<U+00E5>r konsesjon for flyruter til Danmark og Tyskland |date=14 December 1990 |agency=[[Norwegian News Agency]] |language=Norwegian}}</ref> but ultimately shut down on 21 November 1991.<ref>{{cite news |title=Agderfly Rute/Charter er konkurs |date=21 November 1991 |agency=[[Norwegian News Agency]] |language=Norwegian}}</ref> The flight school continued to operate.<ref>{{cite news |title=Fly-lappen pr. brevkurs |last=Fonb<U+00E6>k |first=Dag |date=30 May 1994 |page=16 |work=[[Verdens Gang]] |language=Norwegian}}</ref> SAS was reorganized in 1990 and the Copenhagen routes were taken over by [[SAS Commuter]]'s Eurolink service with new [[Fokker 50]] aircraft.<ref>Hall: 176<U+2013>177</ref> [[Norsk Air]] introduced a service from [[Sandefjord Airport, Torp]] via Kristiansand to [[London Stansted Airport]] on 28 October 1991.

Avinor installed a {{convert|90|m|sp=us}} long section of [[engineered materials arrestor system]] at the end of each runway in 2012. Kjevik is the only airport in Norway with this system, as the proximity to vulnerable marine environment prohibits the creation of a conventional safety zone around the runways. The south end was installed in July and the north end later in the year. The installations cost between 70 and 80 million [[Norwegian krone]].<ref name=dallokken>{{cite news |url=http://www.tu.no/motor/2012/07/05/fanger-lopske-fly |title=Fanger l<U+00F8>pske fly |date=5 July 2012 |last=Dall<U+00F8>kken |first=Per Erlien |language=Norwegian |work=[[Teknisk Ukeblad]] |accessdate=8 July 2012 |archivedate=8 July 2012 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/690Lrq7MY |deadurl=no}}</ref> The control tower from 1966 was not sufficiently high to give the [[air traffic controller]]s full view of the runway.
