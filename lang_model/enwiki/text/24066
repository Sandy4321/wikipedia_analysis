'''''Homo floresiensis''''' ("[[Flores]] Man"; nicknamed ''[[Hobbit]]'') is a possible [[species]] in the [[genus]] ''[[Homo (genus)|Homo]]'', remarkable for its small body and [[brain]] and for its survival until relatively recent times. It was named after the [[Indonesia]]n island of [[Flores]] on which the remains were found.<ref name="Brown04">{{cite journal| author=Brown, P. | coauthors=Sutikna, T., Morwood, M. J., Soejono, R.

The discoverers (anthropologists Peter Brown, Michael Morwood and their colleagues) have argued that a variety of features, both primitive and derived, identified the skeleton of LB1 as that of a new species, ''H. floresiensis'', of the [[Hominini]] tribe that currently comprises [[homo (genus)|humans]] (''Homo'') and two species of [[chimpanzee]] (''Pan''), their ancestors, and the [[extinct]] lineages of their common ancestor.<ref name = "Brown04" /><ref name = "Morwood04" /> They argued that it lived contemporaneously with modern [[human]]s (''[[Homo sapiens]]'') on [[Flores]].

Doubts that the remains constitute a new species were soon voiced by the Indonesian anthropologist [[Teuku Jacob]], who suggested that the skull of LB1 was a [[microcephalic]] modern human. A controversy developed, leading to the publication of a number of studies which supported or rejected claims for species status.

==Discovery==
[[Image:Homo floresiensis cave.jpg|thumb|325px|Cave on Flores Island where the specimens were discovered.]]
[[File:ID - Flores.PNG|thumb|Flores Island in Indonesia, shown highlighted in red]]
 
The first specimens were discovered by a joint Australian-[[Indonesia]]n team of [[paleoanthropology|paleoanthropologists]] and [[archaeology|archaeologists]] looking for evidence of the original [[human migration]] of ''H. sapiens'' from Asia to Australia.<ref name = "Brown04" /><ref name = "Morwood04" /> They were not expecting to find a new species, and were surprised at the recovery of a nearly complete skeleton of a hominid they dubbed LB1 from the [[Liang Bua Cave|Liang Bua]] [[limestone]] cave on [[Flores]]. Subsequent excavations recovered seven additional skeletons, dating from 38,000 to 13,000 years ago.<ref name = "Morwood05" /> An arm bone, provisionally assigned to ''H. floresiensis'', is about 74,000 years old. Sophisticated stone implements of a size considered appropriate to the 1&nbsp;m tall human are also widely present in the cave. These are at horizons from 95,000 to 13,000 years ago and are associated with juvenile ''[[Stegodon]]'' (a group of [[proboscidea]]ns that was widespread throughout Asia during the [[Quaternary]]), presumably the prey of LB1.<ref name = "Morwood05" /> They also shared the island with giant rats, [[Komodo dragon]]s, and even larger species of lizard.<ref>[http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2004/10/27/1098667841536.html Lost race of human 'hobbits'].

The specimens are not [[fossil]]ized, but were described by Richard Roberts of the [[University of Wollongong]], Australia as having "the consistency of wet [[blotting paper]]"<ref name = "DaltonNatureNews04">{{cite journal | author = Dalton, R. | coauthors = | date = October 28, 2004 | title = Little lady of Flores forces rethink of human evolution | journal = [[Nature (journal)|Nature]] | volume = 431 | pages = 1029 | doi = 10.1038/4311029a}}</ref> (once exposed, the bones had to be left to dry before they could be dug up). Researchers hope to find preserved [[mitochondrial DNA]] to compare with samples from similarly unfossilised specimens of ''[[Neanderthal|Homo neanderthalensis]]'' and ''H. sapiens''.<ref name = "DaltonNatureNews04" />

==Anatomy==
The most important and obvious identifying features of ''H. floresiensis'' are its small body and small cranial capacity.  Brown and Morwood also identified a number of additional, less obvious features that might distinguish LB1 from modern ''H. sapiens'', including the form of the [[teeth]], the absence of a [[chin]], and the unusually low twist in the forearm bones.  Each of these putative distinguishing features has been heavily scrutinized by the scientific community, with different independent research groups reaching differing conclusions whether these features support the original designation of a new species,<ref name = "Argue06" /> or whether they identify LB1 as a severely pathological ''H. sapiens''.<ref name = "Jacob06" />  The discovery of additional partial skeletons<ref name = "Morwood05" /> has verified the existence of some features found in LB1, such as the lack of a chin, but Jacob and other research teams argue that these features do not distinguish LB1 from local ''H. sapiens'' morphology.<ref name = "Jacob06" /> Recent research of Lyras et al.,<ref name="lyras">{{cite journal|author=Lyras, G.A., Dermitzakis, D.M., Van Der Geer, A.A.E., Van der Geer, S.B., De Vos, J.|year=2008|title=The origin of ''Homo floresiensis'' and its relation to evolutionary processes under isolation|journal=Anthropological Science|date=August 1, 2008|url=http://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/ase/advpub/0/advpub_0807280043/_article|doi=10.1537/ase.080411|volume=117|pages=33}}</ref> based on 3D-morphometrics, shows that the skull of LB1 differs significantly from all ''H. sapiens'' skulls, including those of small-bodied individuals and microcephalics, and is similar only to the skull of ''[[Homo erectus]]''.

===Small bodies===
The [[holotype|type specimen]] for the proposed species is a fairly complete [[human skeleton|skeleton]] and near-complete [[skull]] proposed to be that of a 30-year-old [[female]] (LB1), nicknamed ''Little Lady of Flores'' or ''Flo'', about 1.06&nbsp;m (3&nbsp;ft 6&nbsp;in) in height.<ref name = "Brown04" /> This short stature is also supported by the height estimates derived from the [[tibia]] of a second skeleton (LB8), on the basis of which Morwood and colleagues suggest that LB8 might have stood 1.09&nbsp;m (3&nbsp;ft 7&nbsp;in) high.<ref name = "Morwood05" /> These estimates are outside the range of normal modern [[human height]] and considerably shorter than the average adult height of even the physically smallest populations of modern humans, such as the African [[pygmy|Pygmies]] (< 1.5&nbsp;m, or 4&nbsp;ft 11&nbsp;in),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9062017/Pygmy|publisher=Encyclopedia Britannica|title=Pygmy|accessdate=2009-03-03}}</ref> [[Twa]], [[Semang]] (1.37&nbsp;m, or 4&nbsp;ft&nbsp;6 in for adult women),<ref name=Fix>{{cite journal | last = Fix | first = Alan G. | title = Malayan Paleosociology: Implications for Patterns of Genetic Variation among the Orang Asli | journal = American Anthropologist, New Series | volume = 97  | issue = 2 | pages = 313<U+2013>323 | month = June | year = 1995 | url = http://links.jstor.org/sici?sici=0002-7294%28199506%292%3A97%3A2%3C313%3AMPIFPO%3E2.0.CO%3B2-%23 | doi = 10.1525/aa.1995.97.2.02a00090}}</ref> or [[Andamanese]] (1.37&nbsp;m, or 4&nbsp;ft 6&nbsp;in for adult women).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.andaman.org/BOOK/chapter5/text5.htm|title=Lonely islands : The Andamanese (Ch. 5)|author=Weber, George|publisher=Andaman Association}}</ref> Mass is generally considered more [[biophysics|biophysically]] significant than a one-dimensional measure of length, and by that measure, due to effects of scaling, differences are even greater. LB1 has been estimated as perhaps about 25&nbsp;kg (55&nbsp;[[pound (mass)|lb]]). This is smaller than not only modern ''H. sapiens'', but also than ''[[H. erectus]]'', which Brown and colleagues have suggested is the immediate ancestor of ''H. floresiensis''.  LB1 and LB8 are also somewhat smaller than the ancestor [[Australopithecus|australopithecine]]s, from three million years ago, not previously thought to have expanded beyond Africa. Thus, LB1 and LB8 may be the shortest and smallest members of the extended human family discovered thus far.

[[Image:Specimen LB1.jpg|thumb|Cast of the entire LB1 specimen]] 

Despite the size difference, the specimens seem otherwise to resemble in their features ''H. erectus'', known to be living in [[Southeast Asia]] at times coincident with earlier finds purported to be of ''H. floresiensis''.<ref name = "Morwood05" /> These [[homology (biology)|observed similarities]] form the basis for the suggested [[cladistics|phylogenetic relationship]]. Controversially, the same team is reported to have found material evidence, stone tools, of a ''H. erectus'' occupation 840,000 years ago, but actual remains of ''H. erectus'' itself have not been found on Flores, much less [[Transitional fossil|transitional forms]].

To explain the small stature of ''H. floresiensis'', Brown and colleagues have suggested that in the limited food environment on Flores ''H. erectus'' underwent strong [[insular dwarfism]],<ref name ="Brown04" /> a form of [[speciation]] also seen on Flores in several species, including a dwarf ''Stegodon'', as well as being observed on other small islands. However, the "[[Island dwarfism|island dwarfing]]" theory has been subjected to some criticism from Teuku Jacob and colleagues<ref name = "Jacob06" /> who argue that LB1 is similar to local Rampasasa ''H. sapiens'' populations, and who point out that size can vary substantially in pygmy populations.

===Small brains===
In addition to a small body size, ''H. floresiensis'' had a remarkably small [[human brain|brain]].  The type specimen, at 380&nbsp;cm<U+00B3> (23&nbsp;[[cubic inch|in<U+00B3>]]), is at the lower range of [[chimpanzee]]s or the extinct [[australopithecine]]s.<ref name = "Brown04" /><ref name = "Falk05" />  The brain is reduced considerably relative to this species' presumed immediate ancestor ''H. erectus'', which at 980&nbsp;cm<U+00B3> (60&nbsp;in<U+00B3>) had more than double the brain volume of its alleged descendant species.<ref name = "Falk05" /> Nonetheless, the estimated [[brain to body mass ratio]] of LB1 lies between that of ''H. erectus'' and the great apes.<ref name = "Falk06a">{{cite journal| author = Falk, D. | coauthors = Hildebolt, C., Smith, K., Morwood, M.J., Sutikna, T., Jatmiko, Wayhu Saptomo, E., Brunsden, B. & Prior, F. | date = May 19, 2006 |title = Response to Comment on "The Brain of LB1, ''Homo floresiensis''"|journal = [[Science (journal)|Science]] | volume = 312 | pages = 999c | doi = 10.1126/science.1124972}}</ref> [[Insular dwarfism]] is challenging explanation of brain size reduction.<ref>{{Cite journal

Indeed, the discoverers have associated ''H. floresiensis'' with [[human behavior|advanced behavior]]s. There is evidence of the use of fire for cooking in Liang Bua cave, and evidence of cut marks on the ''Stegodon'' bones associated with the finds.<ref name = "Morwood04" /><ref name = "Morwood05" /> The species has also been associated with [[stone tool]]s of the sophisticated [[Upper Paleolithic]] tradition typically associated with modern humans, who at 1310&ndash;1475&nbsp;cm<U+00B3> (80&ndash;90&nbsp;in<U+00B3>) nearly quadruple the brain volume of ''H. floresiensis'' (with body mass increased by a factor of 2.6).  Some of these tools were apparently used in the necessarily [[co-operation|cooperative]] [[hunting]] of local dwarf ''[[Stegodon]]'' by this small human species.<ref name = "Morwood05" /> 

An indicator of intelligence is the size of region 10 of the dorsomedial [[prefrontal cortex]], which is associated with [[self-awareness]] and is about the same size as that of modern humans, despite the much smaller overall size of the brain.<ref name = "Falk05" />

===Additional features===
Additional features used to argue that the finds come from a population of previously unidentified hominids include the absence of a [[chin]], the relatively low twist of the [[humerus|arm bones]], and the width of the [[leg bone]]s relative to their length.<ref name = "Brown04" /><ref name="Morwood04" /><ref name="Morwood05" />  The presence of each of these features has been confirmed by independent investigators<ref name = "Jacob06" /> but their significance has been disputed.

In 2007, Susan G. Larson et al. focused on the twist of the nearly complete upper arm bone of the LB1<U+2019>s skeleton.<ref name = Larson2007/> Modern people have the top of the bone twisted between 145 to 165 degrees, which makes the inner part of the [[elbow]] face slightly forward. Larson originally stated that the LB1<U+2019>s bone was twisted only 110 degrees,<ref name="Culotta">{{cite journal | last = Culotta | first = Elisabeth | authorlink = | title = How the Hobbit Shrugged: Tiny Hominid<U+2019>s Story Takes New Turn | journal = Science | volume = 312 | issue = 5776 | pages = 983<U+2013>984 | publisher = American Association for the Advancement in Science | date = May 19, 2006 | url = http://www.clas.ufl.edu/users/krigbaum/4468/Culotta_Flores_2006_Science.pdf | doi = 10.1126/science.312.5776.983a | accessdate = 2008-02-14 | pmid = 16709753}}</ref> but later made a new measurement and found that the torsion was 120 degrees. This could be an advantage when arm-swinging, but complicates activities associated with modern people, such as tool-making. Larson et al. investigated also the [[pectoral girdle]] of ''H. floresiensis''. Due to the incomplete material they studied a broken [[clavicle]] of LB1 and a [[shoulder blade]] of the individual referred to as LB6. The clavicle was relatively short, which in combination with the shape of the shoulder blade and the low twist of the arm bone resulted in the shoulder being moved forwards slightly, as if it was shrugged. Thus ''H. floresiensis'' could bend the elbow in the way modern people do and Larson concluded that it could have been able to make tools as well.<ref name=Larson2007/>

In September 2007, Matthew W. Tocheri of the [[Smithsonian]]'s [[National Museum of Natural History]] and his team published a paper on the [[wrist]] of ''H. floresiensis''. They studied three complete [[carpal bone]]s, a [[trapezoid bone|trapezoid]], [[scaphoid bone|scaphoid]] and [[capitate bone|capitate]], believed to belong to LB1. Tocheri et al. found that the shapes of these bones differ significantly from the bones of modern human wrist and that they resemble the wrist of great African [[ape]]s or ''[[Australopithecus]]''.<ref name=Tocheri2007/>

Jungers et al., who published a study on the [[leg|lower limbs]],<ref name="Jungers">{{cite journal | last = Jungers | first = William L. | authorlink = | title = Descriptions of the lower limb skeleton of ''Homo floresiensis'' | journal = Journal of Human Evolution | volume = 57| issue = | pages = 538| date = December 4, 2008 | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&_udi=B6WJS-4V2PSNH-1&_user=10&_rdoc=1&_fmt=&_orig=search&_sort=d&view=c&_acct=C000050221&_version=1&_urlVersion=0&_userid=10&md5=f61fb21de0ea1cfea8e8a9a422d3d85d| doi = 10.1016/j.jhevol.2008.08.014 | accessdate = 2009-03-10 | last2 = Larson | first2 = S.G. | last3 = Harcourt-Smith | first3 = W. | last4 = Morwood | first4 = M.J. | last5 = Sutikna | first5 = T. | last6 = Due Awe | first6 = Rokhus | last7 = Djubiantono | first7 = T.}}</ref>  found that ''H. floresiensis<U+2019>'' feet were unusually flat and large in comparison with the rest of the body. As a result, when walking, it would have to bend its [[knee]]s further back than modern people do. According to Jungers, its walk resembled a sort of high stepped [[gait]] and it was not able to walk very fast.

The species is thought to have survived on Flores until at least as recently as 12,000 years ago making it the longest-lasting non-modern human, surviving long past the [[Neanderthal]]s (''H. neanderthalensis'') which became [[Extinction|extinct]] about 24,000 years ago.<ref name=Morwood05/>

Due to a deep neighboring [[strait]], Flores remained isolated during the Wisconsin glaciation (the [[last glacial period|most recent glacial period]]), despite the low [[sea level rise|sea level]]s that united much of the rest of [[Sundaland]]. This has led the discoverers of ''H. floresiensis'' to conclude the species, or its ancestors, could only have reached the isolated island by [[ship transport|water transport]], perhaps arriving in bamboo rafts around 100,000 years ago (or, if they are ''H. erectus'', then about 1 million years ago). This idea of Flores using advanced technology and cooperation on a modern human level has prompted the discoverers to hypothesize that ''H. floresiensis'' almost certainly had language.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2004/10/041028144857.htm |title=Skeleton reveals lost world of 'Little people' |dateformat= mdy|accessdate=2006-10-21 |author= |date=October 28, 2004 |year= |month= |work=Science Daily |publisher= |quote=We also believe that their ancestors may have reached the island using bamboo rafts. The clear implication is that, despite tiny brains, these little humans were intelligent and almost certainly had language. }}</ref> These suggestions have been some of the most controversial of the discoverers' findings.

Local [[geology]] suggests that a [[volcano|volcanic]] eruption on Flores approximately 12,000 years ago was responsible for the demise of ''H. floresiensis'', along with other local fauna, including the [[dwarf elephant]] ''[[Stegodon]]''.<ref name=Morwood04/> Gregory Forth hypothesized that this species may have survived longer in other parts of Flores to become the source of the ''[[Ebu Gogo]]'' stories told among the local people. The ''Ebu Gogo'' are said to have been small, hairy, language-poor cave dwellers on the scale of ''H. floresiensis''.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Forth, G.|year=2005|title=Hominids, hairy hominoids and the science of humanity|journal=Anthropol.

==Controversies==
Whether the specimens represent a new species is a controversial issue within the scientific community. Professor [[Teuku Jacob]], chief [[paleontologist]] of the Indonesian [[Gadjah Mada University]], and other scientists reportedly disagree with the placement of the new finds into a new species of ''Homo''. Instead, Jacob proposed that they were members of "<U+2026>a [[sub-species]] of ''Homo sapiens'' classified under the [[Australoid|Austrolomelanesid]] race".<ref>Agence France-Presse, ''Indonesian scientist says Flores hominid not new species'', November, 2004</ref> He contended that the find is from a 25<U+2013>30 year-old [[omnivore|omnivorous]] subspecies of ''H. sapiens'', and not a 30-year-old female of a new species. He is convinced that the small skull is that of a mentally defective modern human, probably a Pygmy, suffering from the [[genetic disorder]] [[microcephaly]], which produces a small brain and skull.

In early December 2004, Jacob removed most of the remains from Soejono's institution, [[Jakarta]]'s National Research Centre of Archaeology, for his own research without the permission of the Centre's directors.<ref>{{cite journal| url=http://www.economist.com/science/displayStory.cfm?story_id=3471304 | title=A paleontological mystery story | journal=[[The Economist]]|date=December 9, 2004 | accessdate=2006-08-20}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | author=Connor, Steve|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/index.cfm?c_id=82&ObjectID=8500998 | title=Hobbit woman' remains spark row among academics|date=November 30, 2004|journal=New Zealand Herald | accessdate=2006-08-20}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | url=http://www.newscientist.com/channel/being-human/mg18424772.900 | title=Fight over access to 'hobbit' bones - being-human | date=December 11, 2004 |journal=New Scientist | accessdate=2006-08-20}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,3-1386423,00.html|author=Hawkes, Nigel|date=December 3, 2004 | title=Professor fuels row over Hobbit man fossils|publisher=Times Online|accessdate=2006-08-20}}</ref> Some expressed fears that, like the [[Dead Sea scrolls]], important scientific evidence would be sequestered by a small group of scientists who neither allowed access by other scientists nor published their own research.

Reports noted the condition of the returned remains; "[including] long, deep cuts marking the lower edge of the Hobbit's jaw on both sides, said to be caused by a knife used to cut away the rubber mould"; "the chin of a second Hobbit jaw was snapped off and glued back together. Whoever was responsible misaligned the pieces and put them at an incorrect angle"; and, "The pelvis was smashed, destroying details that reveal body shape, gait and evolutionary history"<ref name="bbc-restart">{{cite web | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/6294101.stm | publisher=BBC News|title=Hobbit cave digs set to restart |date=January 25, 2007| accessdate=2007-01-30}}</ref> and causing the discovery team leader Morwood to remark "It's sickening, Jacob was greedy and acted totally irresponsibly".<ref name="smh.com.au"/> Jacob, however, denied any wrongdoing. He stated that such damages occurred during transport from [[Yogyakarta (city)|Yogyakarta]] back to Jakarta<ref name="bbc-restart"/> despite the physical evidence to the contrary that the jawbone had been broken while making a mold of bones.<ref name="smh.com.au"/>

In 2005 Indonesian officials forbade access to the cave and thus no other excavations in the place were possible. Some media, such as the [[BBC]], expressed the opinion that the reason of the restriction was to protect Jacob, who was considered "Indonesia's king of palaeoanthropology", from being proven to be wrong. Scientists were allowed to return to the cave in 2007, the same year that Jacob died from liver disease.<ref name="bbc-restart"/>

Prior to Jacob's removal of the fossils, a CT scan was taken of the skull and in 2005, a computer-generated model of the skull of ''H. floresiensis'' was undertaken, and analysed by a team headed by [[Dean Falk]] of [[Florida State University]]. The results were published in ''Science'' in February 2005. The authors of the study claimed that the brainpan was not that of a pygmy nor an individual with a malformed skull and brain, supporting the view that it is a new species.<ref name="Falk05" /> However, in October 2005 ''Science'' published an additional study headed by Alfred Czarnetzki, Carsten M. Pusch and Jochen Weber. This disagreed with the findings of the earlier study and concluded that the skull of LB1 is consistent with microcephaly.<ref>{{cite journal| url=http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/310/5746/236b | title=Technical Comments: Comment on "The Brain of LB1, Homo floresiensis" | accessdate=2007-03-28 |journal=Science|date=October 14, 2005|author=Weber, J., Czarnetzki, A., Pusch, C.M.|volume=310|issue=5746|page=236|doi=10.1126/science.1114789}}</ref> 

The results of the February 2005 study were also questioned in the May 19, 2006, issue of the journal ''Science'', in which Robert D. Martin of the [[Field Museum]] in Chicago and co-authors argued that the 2005 study had not compared the skull with a typical example of adult microcephaly. Martin and his co-authors concluded that the skull was probably microcephalic. Martin argued that the brain is far too small to be a separate dwarf species; if it were, he wrote, the 400-cubic-centimeter brain would indicate a creature only one foot in height, which would be one-third the size of the discovered skeleton.<ref name=Times20May2006>{{cite journal|title='Hobbit' Bones Said to Be of Deformed Human|journal=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=Saturday, May 20, 2006}}</ref> In the September 5, 2006, issue of the ''[[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences]]'', a group of scientists from Indonesia, Australia, and the United States came to the same conclusion as Dr. Martin (i.e. that the skull is of a microcephalic human rather than a separate species) by examining bone and skull structure.<ref name = "Jacob06"/> 

===Evidence against microcephaly===
[[File:H-floresiensis-Cretan-microcephalic.jpg|thumb|right|A cast of LB1 (left) was compared to several microcephalic skulls, amongst which that of the microcephalic (right) used by Henneman in his attempt to present LB1 as a microcephalic. Argue (2006) and Lyras (2008) contend the opposite]]

In response, Brown and Morwood have criticized these recent findings by claiming that the scientists came to incorrect conclusions about bone and skull structure and mistakenly attributed the height of ''H. floresiensis'' to microcephaly.<ref name=NYTimes21August2006>{{cite news | title = Report Reignites Feud Over 'Little People' as Separate Species | url = http://www.nytimes.com/2006/08/21/science/21cnd-tiny.html | publisher = [[The New York Times]]|date =August 21, 2006| accessdate = 2006-08-21|author=Wilford, J.N.}}</ref> They also pointed to studies by other scientists who rejected the argument that the individual was diseased. Falk's team replied to the critics of their study, standing by their results and insisting that the skull is very different from microcephalic specimens.<ref name = "Falk06a" /> [[William Jungers]], a morphologist from [[Stony Brook University]], examined the skull and concluded that the skeleton displays "no trace of disease". However, Jochen Weber of the [[German Academy of Sciences Leopoldina|Leopoldina]] Hospital in [[Schweinfurt]] argues that "we can't rule out the possibility that he suffered from microcephaly".<ref>{{cite news |first=Rafaela |last=Von Bredow|title=A Huge Fight over a Little Man |url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/spiegel/0,1518,434604,00.html |work=[[Der Spiegel]] |publisher= |date=September 1, 2006 |accessdate=2009-03-03 }}</ref> Debbie Argue of the [[Australian National University]] has also published a study in the ''[[Journal of Human Evolution]]'' which rejects microcephaly and concludes that the finds are indeed a new species.<ref>{{cite news |first=Dan |last=Vergano|title=The hullabaloo about hobbits |url=http://www.usatoday.com/tech/science/columnist/vergano/2006-07-16-hobbit-argument_x.htm |work=[[USA Today]] |publisher= |date=July 16, 2006|accessdate=2009-03-03 }}</ref> 

On January 29, 2007, Falk published a new study supporting the claim to species status<ref name = Falk2007 /> offering further evidence that the claims of a microcephalic ''H. sapiens'' were not credible. In this new study Falk examines 3D computer generated models of an additional 9 microcephalic brains and 10 normal human brains, and reveals that the floresiensis skulls have a shape more aligned with normal human brains, but also have unique features which are consistent with what one would expect in a new species.  Comparing the frontal and temporal lobes, as well as the back of the skull, revealed a brain highly developed, completely unlike the microcephalic brain, and advanced in ways different from modern human brains. This finding also answered past criticisms that the ''floresiensis'' brain was simply too small to be capable of the intelligence required to create the tools found in their proximity. Falk concludes the onus is now upon the critics that continue to claim microcephaly to produce a brain of a microcephalic that bears resemblance to the ''floresiensis'' brain.

The above mentioned study by Lyras et al. (2008) confirms Falk's results in that 3D-morphometric features of the skulls of microcephalic ''H. sapiens'' indeed fall within the range of normal ''H. sapiens'' and that the LB1 skull falls well outside this range. This means that LB1 cannot, based on either brain or skull morphology, be classified as a microcephalic ''H. sapiens''.<ref name="lyras"/>

In 2009, a study by Jungers et al. presented a statistical analysis of skull shapes of healthy modern humans, microcephalic humans, and several ancient human species, as well as ''H. floresiensis''. They showed that the three grouped separately, with ''H. floresiensis'' among the ancient humans, providing evidence that ''H. floresiensis'' is a genuine species instead of a diseased modern human.<ref name="Jungers01" />

===Laron syndrome===
The possibility that the skeletons from Flores are the remains of people who suffered from [[Laron syndrome]] was first proposed by American anatomist Gary D.&nbsp;Richards in June 2006.<ref name="Hawks">{{cite web | last = Hawks | first = John | authorlink = | title = Another diagnosis for a hobbit | work = | publisher = | date = July 3, 2007 | url = http://johnhawks.net/weblog/fossils/flores/hershkovitz_laron_syndrome_2007.html | format = online | accessdate = 2009-02-10}}</ref> A year later, in June 2007, Israel Hershkovitz, Liora Kornreich and [[Zvi Laron]] from the [[Tel Aviv University]] in [[Israel]] published a new paper arguing that the morphological features of ''H. floresiensis'' are essentially indistinguishable from those of Laron syndrome.<ref name="Hershkovitz">{{cite journal |author=Hershkovitz, I., Kornreich, L., Laron, Z. |title=Comparative skeletal features between Homo floresiensis and patients with primary growth hormone insensitivity (Laron Syndrome) |journal=American Journal of Physical Anthropology |volume=134 |issue=2 |pages=198<U+2013>208 |year=2007 |pmid=17596857 |doi=10.1002/ajpa.20655}}</ref> Laron syndrome causes severe [[pituitary dwarfism]].

The disease is most often reported with [[Middle East]] children of [[Consanguinity|consanguineous]] parents,<ref name="WhoNamedIt"/> but it also occurs in some South-East Asian countries.<ref name="Hershkovitz"/>

The Israeli researchers compared [[X-ray]]s of Israelis affected with Laron syndrome, whose heights ranged between 108 and 128&nbsp;cm, with data from LB1.<ref name="ScienceNews"/> They compared 36&nbsp;features from around the skeleton and concluded that most features were similar,<ref name="Hawks"/> including a pronounced [[Supraorbital ridge|ridge]] above the eyes, absence of a particular [[Paranasal sinuses|sinus]], and short limbs in proportion to the trunk.<ref name="ScienceNews"/> They declared that Laron syndrome patients also have smaller heads, although not as small as LB1, and that many of the unique anatomical landmarks that [[Dean Falk]] had found left by the brain on the inner part of the LB1's skull, could have also been a feature of Laron syndrome.<ref name="Hawks"/><ref name="Hershkovitz"/> People with Laron syndrome also have a dense [[Mastoid part of the temporal bone|mastoid region]] bone, unlike healthy individuals, whose bone in this part of the skull is spongy and filled with air. Hershkovitz did not make this comparison, because no radiographs of LB1's skull were available.<ref name="Hawks"/><ref name="Hershkovitz"/> However, Falk examined the CT scans her team had made and found that LB1's mastoid region does not manifest any signs of Laron syndrome.<ref name="Hawks2">{{cite web | last = Hawks | first = John | title = The Liang Bua report | work = | publisher =  | date = August 10, 2007| url = http://johnhawks.net/weblog/fossils/flores/hershkovitz_laron_syndrome_2007.html | format = online | accessdate = 2009-02-10}}</ref>

===Bone structure===
The bone structure of ''H. floresiensis''<U+2019> shoulders, arms<ref name="Larson2007" /> and wrists<ref name="Tocheri2007" /> have been described as very different from modern humans, much closer to the bone structure of chimpanzees or an early hominin. This adds support to the idea that the Hobbit is a separate species of early human rather than a modern human with a physical disorder.

Susan G. Larson et al. analyzed the upper limb of LB1. They found that LB1<U+2019>s arm torsion is unusually low, much lower than with modern people. This had been previously studied by G. D. Richards et al., who declared that it is a sign of modern pygmy populations, and T. Jacob et al., who pointed out that muscle attachments on the bone suggest LB1 had weak muscles which resulted in little development of humeral torsion. Larson et al. opposed Richards<U+2019> conclusion, arguing that pygmy populations usually have arm bones similarly twisted as average stature peoples. They argued that Richards et al. cited a 1972 paper which had studied a sample of six female Eastern Central African pygmies and this sample was too small to represent the whole population. Larson et al. also looked for some signs of microcephaly on the studied bones, but failed to find any.<ref name = Larson2007/>

[[William L. Jungers]] of the [[Stony Brook University]] in New York compared the low twist of the arm bone of ''H. floresiensis'' to the similarly small [[humerus|humeral]] torsion of an early hominid from [[Dmanisi]] in [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]],<ref>{{Cite journal | last = Bower | first = Bruce | title = Walking Small: Humanlike legs took ''Homo'' out of Africa | journal = ScienceNews | volume = 172 | issue = 12 | pages =  | date = September 22, 2007  | url =  }} (article available at an [http://sci.tech-archive.net/Archive/sci.archaeology/2007-09/msg01451.html online discussion archive])</ref> usually designated as ''[[Homo georgicus]]''. Larson et al. also studied a relatively short [[clavicle]] and unusual formation of the [[pectoral girdle]]. They compared their finding with a ''H. erectus'' skeleton, KNM-WT 15000, known as [[Turkana Boy|Nariokotome Boy]], and suggested that the pectoral girdle of ''H. floresiensis'' was a [[Transitional fossil|transitional stage]] in human shoulder evolution.<ref name = Larson2007/>

While some specialists, including paleoanthropologist Russell Ciochon of the [[University of Iowa]], supported the conclusion, others, including Eric Delson of [[Lehman College]], City University of New York, pointed out that the recent sample of ''H. floresiensis'' individuals is too small and that Larson<U+2019>s research was based just on one shoulder bone.<ref name="Culotta"/>

Another study supporting the separate species hypothesis was published by Matthew Tocheri et al., who studied ''H. floresiensis'' wrist bones. They compared three [[carpal bone]]s believed to belong to LB1 with carpal bones of modern humans, some earlier hominids and African apes. They concluded that the carpals from the Liang Bua cave resembled ape carpal bones and were significantly different from the bones of ''H. sapiens'', ''[[Homo neanderthalensis]]'' or even ''[[Homo antecessor]]'', and that they were comparable to carpal bones of ''[[Australopithecus]]''. The carpal bones of ''H. floresiensis'' lack features that evolved with ancestors of modern humans at least about 800,000 years ago. These features are already formed during [[embryogenesis]] and therefore Tocheri et al. argue that it is improbable that the shape of ''H. floresiensis'' wrist bones could be a result of a developmental disease.<ref name = Tocheri2007/>

This conclusion was challenged by Robert Martin of the Field Museum in Chicago, who noted that no research of wrists of microcephalic people had been done.<ref>{{Cite journal | last = Holmes | first = Bob | title = 'Hobbit' wrist bones suggest a distinct species | journal = New Scientist | volume = | issue = | pages =  | date = September 20, 2007 | url = http://www.newscientist.com/article/dn12667-hobbit-wrist-bones-suggests-a-distinct-species.html | doi = }}</ref> Alan Thorne of the [[Australian National University]] stated that the differences were small and similar variation could occur with living modern humans. He also pointed out that the carpal bones had been found scattered in the cave and it was not certain that they all belonged to the same individual.<ref name=ABCNews>{{Cite journal | last = Salleh | first = Anna | title = Wrist gives hobbit theory the flick | journal = ABC News in Science | volume = 172 | issue = 12 | pages =  | date = September 21, 2007 | url = http://www.southeastasianarchaeology.com/2007/09/21/wrist-gives-hobbit-theory-the-flick/ }}</ref> Michael Morwood of the [[University of Wollongong]] in Australia, one of the co-authors of the study, opposed Thorne stating that there were also other features, such as the stature, body proportions, brain size, shoulder, [[pelvis]], jaw and teeth which suggested that ''H. floresiensis'' is a separate species that evolved in isolation on the island.<ref name=ABCNews/>

The new species theory was supported also by a study on ''H. floresiensis''<U+2019> lower limbs by William L. Jungers and his team (consisting mostly of the same scientists who had authored the upper limbs study).<ref name="Jungers"/> One of the most notable differences in the structure of the lower limb bones was unusually flat and large feet in comparison with the rest of the body. The big toe was described unusually short, similar to earlier hominids, including ''Australopithecus''.<ref name="Callaway"/> Anthropologist Henry McHenry of the [[University of California]] declared that Jungers<U+2019> findings could end discussions on any disease hypothesis. According to him a bigger mystery is where ''H. floresiensis'' originated.<ref name="Callaway"/> John Hawks of the [[University of Wisconsin<U+2013>Madison]] remained unconvinced, stating that the study did not perform enough comparison of the described features with various modern pygmy populations.<ref name="Hawks2">{{cite web | last = Hawks | first = John | authorlink = | title = The forelimb and hindlimb remains from Liang Bua cave  | work = | publisher = | date = December 18, 2008 | url = http://johnhawks.net/weblog/fossils/flores/jungers-larson-hindlimb-forelimb-2008.html | format = online | accessdate = 2009-03-10}}</ref>

===Endemic cretinism hypothesis===
In 2008 Australian researchers Peter J. Obendorf, Charles E. Oxnard, and Ben J. Kefford suggested that LB1 and LB6 suffered [[Myxedema|myxoedematous]] (ME) [[cretinism#Endemic cretinism and iodine deficiency|endemic cretinism]] resulting from [[congenital hypothyroidism]] and that they were part of an affected population of ''H. sapiens'' on the island.<ref name="ProceedingsRoySoc"/> This disease, caused by various environmental factors including iodine deficiency, is a form of dwarfism which can still be found among the local Indonesian population. Affected people, who were born without a functioning [[thyroid]], have both small bodies and reduced brain size but their [[mental retardation]] and motor disability is not as severe as with neurological endemic cretins. According to the authors of the study, the critical environment could have been present on Flores approximately 18,000 years ago, the period to which the LB fossils are dated. They wrote that various features found on the fossils, such as enlarged [[pituitary fossa]],<ref name="ProceedingsRoySoc" /> unusually straight and untwisted top of the upper arm bone and relatively thick limbs,<ref name="Funnel">{{cite web | last = | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = Hobbit Controversy Continues - Claims of Cretinism Rejected on Several Counts | work = | publisher = The Funneled Web | date = March 6, 2008 | url = http://www.the-funneled-web.com/N&V_2008%20(Jan-Dec)/N&V_0803/news__views_item_mar_2008-080306.htm | format = online | accessdate = 2009-02-08}}</ref> are a sign of this diagnosis. The double rooted lower [[premolar]] and primitive wrist morphology can be explained in this way as well. The oral stories about strange human-like creatures may also be a record of cretinism.<ref name="ProceedingsRoySoc" /> 

R. D. Martin has expressed his delight that other researchers continue to explore the possibility that the small skull is in fact a pathological specimen, but he still prefers the microcephaly hypothesis. Dean Falk challenged the Australian team's results, studying computer tomography scans of LB1's pituitary fossa and coming to the conclusion that it is not larger than usual. Because the fossa size was the key argument of the study on ME endemic cretinism, Falk dismissed the whole hypothesis. Peter Brown, the discoverer of the fossils, declared that the remains of the pituitary fossa were very poorly preserved and no meaningful measurement was possible.<ref name="Funnel" /> Other measurements of Obendorf et al. were also disputed, since they had neither the bones nor CT scans available and used just captured images from [[X-ray]] scans presented in the 2005 [[BBC]] show ''The Mystery of the Human Hobbit''.<ref name="AnthropologyNet">{{cite web | last = Kamrani | first = Kambiz | authorlink =  | title = Were Homo floresiensis just a population of myxoedematous endemic cretin Homo sapiens? | work = Anthropology.net | publisher = | date =March 5, 2008 | url = http://anthropology.net/2008/03/05/was-homo-floresiensis-a-population-of-myxoedematous-endemic-cretin-homo-sapiens/ | format = online | doi = | accessdate = 2009-02-08}}</ref>

===Cladistic analysis===
A study published in July 2009, by a team led by Debbie Argue, used [[Cladistics|cladistic analysis]] to suggest that the remains are from a separate species of ''[[Homo (genus)|Homo]]''.<ref name="Argue, D." />  The study describes two equally possible [[phylogenetic tree]]s; one indicates ''H. floresiensis'' emerged between ''[[Homo rudolfensis|H. rudolfensis]]'' (1.86 Ma) and ''[[Homo habilis|H. habilis]]'' (1.66-1.9 Ma), with the second tree indicating that ''H. floresiensis'' emerged after ''H. habilis''.
