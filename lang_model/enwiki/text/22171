The '''flagtail swellshark''' (''Cephaloscyllium signourum'') is a little-known [[species]] of [[catshark]], [[family (biology)|family]] [[Scyliorhinidae]], found at a depth of {{convert|480|-|700|m|ft|abbr=on}} off northeastern [[Queensland]] and possibly also nearby islands. This stout-bodied shark has a short, broad, and flattened head with a capacious mouth. Adults have a variegated brown coloration with 9&ndash;10 darker dorsal saddles and "V"-shaped blotch at the tip of the upper [[caudal fin]] lobe. Juveniles are yellow with narrow brown bars instead of saddles, and a distinctive marking between the [[spiracle]]s shaped like two loops connected by a line. Like other swellsharks, this species can inflate its body when threatened.

==Taxonomy==
In 1994, [[Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation]] (CSIRO) chief researchers Peter Last and John Stevens recognized an undescribed [[Australia]]n swellshark with a variegated color pattern, which they provisionally named ''Cephaloscyllium'' "sp. E". Later investigation revealed that "sp. E" in fact constituted two species: the [[speckled swellshark]] (''C. speccum'') and the flagtail swellshark, which was formally described in a 2008 CSIRO publication by Peter Last, Bernard S<U+00E9>ret, and William White.<ref name="last et al"/> In reference to its distinctive [[caudal fin]] marking, the shark was given the [[specific epithet]] ''signourum'' from the [[Latin]] ''signum'' ("flag") and the [[Greek language|Greek]] ''oura'' ("tail"). The [[type specimen]] is a {{convert|74|cm|in|abbr=on}} long female collected at the [[Lihou Reef National Nature Reserve|Lihou Reef and Cays]], near [[Queensland]].<ref name="last et al"/>

==Distribution and habitat==
The flagtail swellshark has been reported from [[Murray Island, Queensland|Murray Island]] and Lihou Reef, off northeastern Queensland. Swellsharks found off [[New Caledonia]], [[Vanuatu]], and [[Fiji]] may also be of this species as they closely resemble Australian specimens, but differ in some [[morphometric]] counts. This [[benthic|bottom-dwelling]] shark occurs at a depth of {{convert|480|-|700|m|ft|abbr=on}}.<ref name="last et al"/>

==Description==
The flagtail swellshark reaches a length of at least {{convert|74|cm|in|abbr=on}}; if swellsharks from [[Oceania]] prove to be conspecific with those from Australia, then this species can grow to over {{convert|1|m|ft|abbr=on}} long. It has a fairly stout body and a short, very broad, and strongly flattened head. The snout is rounded, with [[nostril]]s preceded by laterally enlarged skin flaps that do not reach the mouth. The slit-like eyes are positioned high on the head, and are followed by tiny [[spiracle]]s. The mouth is short and wide, without furrows at the corners. There are 84 upper tooth rows and 97 lower tooth rows. Most of the small teeth have three cusps with the central cusp the longest; the teeth toward the jaw corners may also have 1&ndash;2 additional lateral cusplets. The upper teeth are exposed when the mouth is closed. The fourth and fifth pairs of [[gill slit]]s lie over the [[pectoral fin]] bases and are shorter than the first three.<ref name="last et al"/>

The pectoral fins are large and broad, with somewhat pointed tips and nearly straight trailing margins. The first [[dorsal fin]] has a narrowly rounded apex and originates over the front half of the bases of the small [[pelvic fin]]s. The second [[dorsal fin]] is smaller and lower than the first, originating before the [[anal fin]] origin. The anal fin is much larger and deeper than the second dorsal fin. The [[caudal fin]] has a distinct lower lobe and a strong ventral notch near the tip of the upper lobe. The body is densely covered by small, overlapping [[dermal denticle]]s with a median ridge and a single cusp, though a few may be three-cusped. Adult sharks are variegated brown above, with 9&ndash;10 dark saddles over the body and tail, a dark blotch atop each pectoral fin, and a distinctive "V"-shaped dark marking at the tip of the caudal fin upper lobe; the underside is plain whitish. Juvenile sharks are light yellow above with dark transverse bars, some of which form hollow saddles, and a pair of narrow loops above the spiracles connected by a curved line.<ref name="last et al"/><ref name="last and stevens"/>

==Biology and ecology==
Like other members of its genus, the flagtail swellshark can inflate itself with water or air as a defense against [[predator]]s. Only a few specimens have been collected and almost nothing is known of its natural history.<ref name="last and stevens"/>

==Human interactions==
The conservation status of the flagtail swellshark has not been evaluated by the [[International Union for Conservation of Nature]] (IUCN).<ref name="fishbase"/>
