The series depicts the everyday lives of office employees in the [[Scranton, Pennsylvania|Scranton]] and [[Stamford, Connecticut|Stamford]] branches of the fictional [[Dunder Mifflin]] Paper Company. In this episode, the two branches are merged. [[Jim Halpert]] ([[John Krasinski]]) and [[Pam Beesley]] ([[Jenna Fischer]]) have an awkward reunion, [[Michael Scott (The Office)|Michael Scott]] ([[Steve Carrel]]) tries to make his new employees feel welcome, and a rivalry begins between [[Dwight Schrute]] ([[Rainn Wilson]]) and [[Andy Bernard]] ([[Ed Helms]]).

According to [[Nielsen Media Research]], an estimated 8.63 million viewers watched "The Merger" on its first broadcast. Critical reception to the episode was mainly positive, with many reviewers spotlighting Helms and his character in particular as highlights.

==Synopsis==
The Scranton and Stamford branches prepare for the upcoming merger. [[Pam Beesley]] ([[Jenna Fischer]]) professes excitement over the merger, including the return of [[Jim Halpert]] ([[John Krasinski]]). [[Andy Bernard]] ([[Ed Helms]]) proclaims he'll be the No. 2 man in Scranton in six weeks time through "name repetition, personality mirroring and never breaking off a handshake." A rivalry between [[Dwight Schrute]] ([[Rainn Wilson]]) and Andy begins over the No. 2 position in the office. At the welcoming party, [[Michael Scott (The Office)|Michael Scott]] ([[Steve Carrel]]) plays a videotape he has created called "Lazy Scranton", which features him and Dwight rhyming over the music of ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'''s "[[Lazy Sunday]]".

Michael embarrasses overweight new employee [[Characters from The Office (US)#Tony Gardner|Tony Gardner]] ([[Mike Bruner]]) by attempting to push him onto a table with the rest of the new employees; this causes Tony to quit. However, an angered Michael fires him instead, unintentionally entitling him to severance pay. Michael learns that Jim is the No. 2 in the office, which prompts Andy and Dwight to argue over who is No. 3. After a plan to unite the employees goes awry, they find that they have a common interest: their contempt of Michael. Jim tells Pam that he is seeing someone. Dwight and Andy trade barbs on the way out of the office.

[[IGN]]'s Brian Zoromski rated "The Merger" 9 out of 10, an indication of an "amazing" episode. He called the opening sequence "arguably the funniest" scene, and believed "Andy's proven to be an even better source of hilarity than he ever was in the Stamford office."<ref name=ignreview/> Zoromski was unhappy however with the "outright product placement " with Staples, writing that "the show's quality felt a little compromised. It's one thing to see blatant product placement in a reality show like ''[[Survivor (U.S. TV series)|Survivor]]'' or ''[[American Idol]]'' but when it invades a great scripted comedy<U+2026> well, it kinda drags the show down to the reality level."<ref name=ignreview>{{Cite web|url=http://tv.ign.com/articles/746/746571p1.html |title=The Office: "The Merger" Review |publisher=[[IGN]] |first=Brian |last=Zoromski |date=November 17, 2006 |accessdate=July 24, 2012}}</ref> Doug Elfman of the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' thought the episode was "funnier than it's been in a while," praising Kelly but criticizing the "fat-guy joke."<ref name=ElfmanNov16/> Elfman cited Michael and Andy's new relationship as a positive element.<ref name=ElfmanNov16>{{Cite web|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-1409031.html |title=NBC supersizes the laughs: Best of network's comedies cut 'must- see' shows down to size |work=[[Chicago Sun-Times]] |first=Doug |last=Elfman |date=November 16, 2006 |accessdate=July 24, 2012}} {{Subscription required}}</ref> [[Television Without Pity]] graded the episode with an A+.<ref name=twpreview>{{Cite web|url=http://www.televisionwithoutpity.com/show/the-office/the-merger-1.php?page=8 |title=The Merger |publisher=[[Television Without Pity]] |first=M |last=Giant |date= |accessdate=July 24, 2012}}</ref>

''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' columnist Abby West praised Fischer's "masterful" performance, writing that it "really is nice to see Pam coming into her own...
