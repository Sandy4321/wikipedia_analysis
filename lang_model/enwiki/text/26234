'''Carroll County''' is a [[county]] located in the [[U.S. state]] of [[Maryland]]. In 2000, its population was 150,897. It was named for [[Charles Carroll of Carrollton|Charles Carroll]] of Carrollton ([[1737]]-[[1832]]), signer of the [[American Declaration of Independence]]. Its [[county seat]] is [[Westminster, Maryland|Westminster]].

This county is a part of the [[Baltimore-Washington Metropolitan Area]]. While predominantly [[rural]], the county has become increasingly [[suburban]] in recent years.

== History ==
Carroll County was created in [[1837]] from parts of [[Baltimore County, Maryland|Baltimore]] and [[Frederick County, Maryland|Frederick Counties]], see [[Hundred (division)]].

The first settlers included 3,700 Germans and their impact may still be seen today in the attitudes of its residents.

During the American Civil War, the population of Carroll County was sharply divided between supporters of the Union and the Confederacy. In 1863, there were significant troop movements through the county as part of the [[Gettysburg]] campaign. On June 29, 1863, the cavalry skirmish known as Corbit's Charge was fought the streets of Westminster, when two companies of Delaware cavalry attacked a much larger Confederate force under General [[J.E.B. Stuart]].

Notable citizens of Carroll County include:
* [[Francis Scott Key]], author of the [[Star Spangled Banner]], was born at his family plantation of Terra Rubra, in what is now western Carroll County.
* [[Whittaker Chambers]], former communist and accuser of [[Alger Hiss]]

== Law and government ==
Carroll County is governed by three county commissioners, the traditional form of county government in Maryland.

Several times in the past, Carroll County voters have rejected charter amendments that would call for a government consisting of a County Executive and a County Council.

In [[2004]] Carroll County voters approved legislation that will expand the number of County Commissioners from three to five. The five Commissioners will be elected from five Commissioner districts, as opposed to three Commissioners elected at-large. This change will occur beginning with the 2010 elections. The change was to take effect beginning with the 2006 elections, but the Maryland General Assembly could not agree on the districts.

The incoming commissioners are:

* [[Julia Walsh Gouge]], President of the Commission, former mayor of  [[Hampstead, Maryland|Hampstead]]
* [[Dean L. Minnich]], from [[Westminster, Maryland|Westminster]]
* [[Michael Zimmer]], a [[Mount Airy, Maryland|Mount Airy]] Lawyer

Republicans hold every county-wide elected office.
