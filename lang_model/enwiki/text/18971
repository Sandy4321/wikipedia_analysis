He is an award-winning artist who works primarily in the [[Minimalism|Minimalist]] and [[Expressionism|Expressionist]] genres.<ref name="ArtInterview" /> Although his work ranges from small table-top pieces to multi-story sculptures, Deutsch "is well-known for his large-scale architectural and environmental projects."<ref name="Axis" /><ref name="Lowe" />

==Life and career==
Deutsch was born in [[Los Angeles, California]], in 1953.<ref name="ArtInterview">[http://www.art-interview.com/Issue_007/interview_Deutsch_Richard.html "Richard Deutsch." ''Art Interview.'' Issue #007.] Accessed 2011-04-07.</ref><ref name="Lowe">"Lowe Enterprises Unveils 'Hulls' at 500 Terry Francois." Press release. Lowe Enterprises.

Deutsch received a [[Bachelor of Fine Arts]] from the [[University of California, Santa Cruz]] in 1976.<ref name="ArtInterview" /><ref name="Axis" /> He originally worked only in [[ceramic]]s, and was influenced by [[Bizen ware]] (a type of very hard, reddish [[Japan|Japanese]] cermic sculpture and pottery).<ref name="ArtInterview" /> The first solo exhibition of his work occurred in [[Seattle, Washington]], in 1978.<ref name="ArtInterview" /> In 1981, his work was part of the "American Porcelain" exhibit at the [[Renwick Gallery]] at the [[Smithsonian Institution]].<ref>Conroy, Sarah Booth. "'American Procelain': A Look at What's New In an Ancient Craft." ''Washington Post.'' November 9, 1980.</ref> (His piece, "Equinox," is now part of the museum's permanent collection.)<ref>[http://americanart.si.edu/collections/search/artwork/?id=6749 "Equinox." Collections. Smithsonian American Art Museum and Renwick Gallery. No date.] Accessed 2011-04-07.</ref> After several years of exhibiting on the [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]] and making larger and larger sculptures, Deutsch decided in the mid-1980s to work in other materials (such as bronze, concrete, granite, plaster, stainless steel, and [[terrazzo]]) and begin creating much larger artworks designed for public spaces.<ref name="ArtInterview" /><ref name="Lowe" /><ref name="Enhances" />

In 2000, Deutsch collaborated with choreographer [[Liss Fain]] on her dance piece, "Quarry."<ref name="Enhances">Amirrezvani, Anita. "Internet Enhances Dance Piece." ''San Jose Mercury News.'' September 22, 2000.</ref> Real-time images of Deutsch at work on a sculpture ("Seven Stones," a {{convert|20|by|36|ft|m}} granite piece) were transmitted via the Internet and projects onto a [[scrim]] and four background panels while six dancers improvised movement (which was intended to make them appaer to be interacting with the Deutsch).<ref name="Enhances" /><ref>Dixon, Steve.

Deutsch lives in [[Davenport, California]].<ref name="Lowe" /><ref name="Technical" />

==Design philosophy==
Deutsch has described his more recent work as an attempt to create an "artist-driven environment" in which the audience interacts with his art by seeing it, touching it, being able to stop and contemplate it, and move through it.<ref name="Axis" /><ref name="Lowe" /> His public art is highly contextual, and he researches the history and setting of a site before beginning his work.<ref name="Axis" /> His sculpture is also often collaborative, as he works with architects, engineers, and landscape architects to ensure that his art fits with the site.<ref name="Axis" />

Deutsch works at a number of studio/workshops in China, Italy, and the United States, and utilizes material from around the world.<ref name="Axis" />
