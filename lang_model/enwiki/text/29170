'''Nelida Fuccaro''' is a historian of the Modern [[Middle East]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.history.ac.uk/reviews/review/872|title=Histories of City and State in the Persian Gulf. Manama since 1800|publisher=Reviews in History ([[Institute of Historical Research]])|accessdate=11 September 2011}}</ref> at the [[School of Oriental and African Studies]], [[University of London]]. She has worked and published extensively on the History of the Modern Iraqi State, with a particular focus on the [[Yazidi]], and [[Kurdish]] populations of the country. Fuccaro has also published on the History of Modern [[Bahrain]]. Fuccaro's work on [[Iraq]] is considered to be unique in historical and academic publication, as it deals with a little known community, and interrogates the relationship between the [[Yazidi]] population with the Iraqi state.

Fuccaro's book entitled "The Other Kurds", significantly changed the way historians and academics view the relationship of minority communities to the larger Iraqi society during the British mandate of the country. The book is also significant in that it helped shed light upon the relationship of the colonial government with minority ethnic communities during the [[British Mandate of Mesopotamia|British Mandate in Iraq]]. This has been significant in its similarity to the modern day situation in Iraqi society, and particularly after the British invasion of the country in 2003.

Fuccaro's work on [[Bahrain]], has been described by other academics such as Madawi Al-Rasheed as a seminal work on the history of the gulf region, and the wider [[Middle East]]. Fuccaro has also made significant contributions to the study of the larger Middle East through her lectures at the [[School of Oriental and African Studies]], [[University of London]], and at other academic institutions in Europe, North America, and the Gulf region.

Fuccaro has been a regular media analyst on issues regarding the Modern [[Middle East]], and particularly on issues concerning the situation in [[Iraq]], and [[Bahrain]].
