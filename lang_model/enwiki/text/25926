It was a member of the last dinosaurian [[fauna]] before the [[Cretaceous-Tertiary extinction event]] around 65.5&nbsp;million years ago. The preservation and completeness of many of its specimens indicate that it may have preferred to live near [[stream]]s.

This [[bipedalism|bipedal]] ornithopod is known from several partial skeletons and skulls that indicate it grew to between 2.5 and 4.0&nbsp;meters (8.2 to 13.1&nbsp;ft) in length on average. It had sturdy hind limbs, small wide hands, and a head with an elongate pointed snout. This genus of dinosaur is regarded as a specialized [[hypsilophodont]] and a [[herbivore]]. Several species have been suggested for this genus. Three are currently recognized as [[valid name (zoology)|valid]], the [[type species]] ''T. neglectus'', as well as ''T. garbanii'' and ''T. assiniboiensis''.

The genus attracted media attention in 2000, when a specimen unearthed in 1993 in [[South Dakota]] was interpreted as including a [[fossil]]ized [[heart]]. There was much discussion over whether the remains were actually of a heart. Many scientists now doubt the identification of the object and the implications of such an identification.

==Classification==
''Thescelosaurus'' has generally been allied to ''[[Hypsilophodon]]'' and other small ornithopods as a [[hypsilophodont]]id, although recognized as being distinct among them for its robust build, unusual hindlimbs, and, more recently, its unusually long skull.<ref name=NSWC04/><ref name=PMG74/><ref name=CMS40/><ref name=SN90>{{cite book |last=Sues |first=Hans-Dieter |coauthors=and Norman, David B. |editor= Weishampel, David B.; Dodson, Peter; and Osm<U+00F3>lska, Halszka (eds.)|title=The Dinosauria |edition=1st |year=1990 |publisher=University of California Press |location=Berkeley |isbn=0-520-06727-4 |pages=498<U+2013>509 |chapter=Hypsilophodontidae, ''Tenontosaurus'', Dryosauridae}}</ref> [[Peter Galton]] in 1974 presented one twist to the classic arrangement, suggesting that because of its hindlimb structure and heavy build (not [[cursorial]], or built for running, by his definition), it should be included in the [[Iguanodont]]idae. This has not been followed, with Morris arguing strongly against Galton's classification scheme.<ref name=WJM76/> At any rate, Galton's Iguanodontidae was not a natural group due to [[polyphyly]], and so would not be recognized under modern [[cladistic]] usage.

==Discovery, history, and species==
[[File:Thescelosaurus neglectus.jpg|left|thumb|Holotype skeleton at the Smithsonian Museum, with skull and neck restored after ''[[Camptosaurus]]'']] 
The [[holotype|type specimen]] of ''Thescelosaurus'' ([[National Museum of Natural History|USNM]]&nbsp;7757) was discovered in 1891 by [[paleontology|paleontologists]] [[John Bell Hatcher]] and William H. Utterback, from [[stratum|beds]] of the [[Maastrichtian|late Maastrichtian]]-age [[Upper Cretaceous]] [[Lance Formation]] of [[Niobrara County, Wyoming|Niobrara County]] (at the time part of [[Converse County, Wyoming|Converse County]]), [[Wyoming]], [[United States|USA]]. The skeleton, however, remained in its shipping crates for years until [[Charles W. Gilmore]] of the [[Smithsonian Institution]]' [[National Museum of Natural History]]  had it prepared and described it in a short paper in 1913, naming it ''T. neglectus'' (''neglectus'': "neglected"). At the time, he thought it was related to ''[[Camptosaurus]]''.<ref name=CWG13>{{cite journal |last=Gilmore |first=Charles W. |authorlink=Charles W.

He considered it to be a light, agile creature, and assigned it to the Hypsilophodontidae, a family of small [[bipedalism|bipedal]] dinosaurs.<ref name=CWG15/>
[[File:Gilmorethesc.jpg|thumb|Charles Gilmore's 1915 reconstruction of the type specimen]]
Other remains of similar animals were found throughout the late 19th century and 20th century, although they did not receive much attention.  Another well-preserved skeleton from the slightly older [[Horseshoe Canyon Formation]], in [[Alberta]], [[Canada]], was named ''T. warreni'' by [[William Parks (paleontologist)|William Parks]] in 1926.<ref name=WAP26>{{cite journal |last=Parks |first=William A |authorlink=William Parks (paleontologist) |year=1926 |title=''Thescelosaurus warreni'', a new species of orthopodous dinosaur from the Edmonton Formation of Alberta |journal=University of Toronto Studies (Geological Series) |volume=21 |pages=1<U+2013>42 }}</ref> This skeleton had notable differences from ''T. neglectus'', and so [[Charles Mortram Sternberg|Charles M.

Morris (1976) as truly different from ''T. neglectus''.<ref name=WJM76/>

[[File:Thescelosaurus neglectus, CMN.jpg|thumb|left|Cast of [[Canadian Museum of Nature|NMC]]&nbsp;8537, type specimen of ''T. edmontonensis'' (''T.'' sp. per Boyd ''et al''., [2009])]]
In his paper, Morris described a specimen ([[South Dakota School of Mines and Technology|SDSM]]&nbsp;7210) consisting of a partial skull with heavy ridges on the lower jaw and cheek, two partial [[vertebra]]e, and two [[phalanx bones|finger bones]] as an unidentified species of ''Thescelosaurus'', from the late Maastrichtian-age [[Hell Creek Formation]] of [[Harding County, South Dakota|Harding County]], [[South Dakota]], USA. He drew attention to its premaxillary teeth and deeply inset toothline which he interpreted as supporting the presence of muscular cheeks. Morris also pointed out the outwardly flaring premaxilla (which would have given it a wide beak) and large palpebrals.<ref name=WJM76/> This skull was recognized as an unnamed hypsilophodont for many years,<ref name=SN90/> until Galton made it the type specimen of new genus and species ''Bugenasaura infernalis'' (large-cheeked lizard belonging to the lower regions", ''infernalis'' being a reference to the Hell Creek Formation).<ref name=PMG95>{{cite journal |last=Galton |first=Peter M. |authorlink=Peter Galton |year=1995 |title=The species of the basal hypsilophodontid dinosaur ''Thescelosaurus'' Gilmore (Ornithischia: Ornithopoda) from the Late Cretaceous of North America |journal=Neues Jahrbuch f<U+00E8>ur Geologie und Pal<U+00E4>ontologie Abhandlungen |volume=198 |issue=3 |pages=297<U+2013>311 }}</ref> Morris also named a new possible species of ''Thescelosaurus'' for specimen ([[Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County|LACM]]&nbsp;33542): ?''T. garbanii'' (with a question mark because he was uncertain that it belonged to the genus).  LACM&nbsp;33542 comprised a large partial hindlimb ("a third larger than described specimens of ''T. neglectus'' and ''[[Parksosaurus]]'' or nearly twice as large as ''[[Hypsilophodon]]''") including a foot, [[tarsus (skeleton)|tarsus]], shin bones, and partial thigh bone, along with five cervical (neck) and eleven dorsal (back) vertebrae, from the Hell Creek Formation of [[Garfield County, Montana|Garfield County]], [[Montana]], USA.  The specimen was discovered by amateur [[paleontology|paleontologist]] [[Harley Garbani]] (hence the name). ''T. garbanii'' would have been about 4.5&nbsp;meters (15&nbsp;feet) long, greater than average specimens of ''T. neglectus''. Aside from the size, Morris drew attention to the way the ankle was constructed, which he considered to be unique except in comparison with ''Thescelosaurus edmontonensis'', which he regarded as a separate species.  Because Morris believed that the ankles of ''T. garbanii'' compared favorably to those of ''T. edmontonensis'', he tentatively assigned it to ''Thescelosaurus''.<ref name=WJM76/> However, the scientific literature has favored Galton's view that ''T. edmontonensis'' was not different from ''T. neglectus'' (see above). In the same paper that he described ''Bugenasaura'', Galton demonstrated that the features Morris had thought connected ''T. garbanii'' and ''T. edmontonensis'' were the result of damage to the latter's ankle, so ''T. garbanii'' could also be considered distinct from ''Thescelosaurus''.  To better accommodate this species, Galton suggested that it belonged to his new genus ''Bugenasaura'' as ''B. garbanii'', although he also noted that it could be belong to the similarly sized [[Pachycephalosauria|pachycephalosaurid]]'' [[Stygimoloch]]'', or be part of a third, unknown dinosaur.<ref name=PMG95/>

Clint Boyd and colleagues published a reassessment of ''Thescelosaurus'', ''Bugenasaura'', and ''Parksosaurus'' in 2009, using new cranial material as a starting point.  They found that ''Parksosaurus'' was indeed distinct from ''Thescelosaurus'', and that the skull of ''Bugenasaura infernalis'' was essentially the same as a skull found with a postcranial skeleton that matched ''Thescelosaurus''.  Because ''B infernalis'' could not be differentiated from ''Thescelosaurus'', they regarded the genus as a synonym of ''Thescelosaurus'', the species as [[nomen dubium|dubious]], and SDSM&nbsp;7210 as an example of ''T.'' sp.  They found that LACM&nbsp;33542, although fragmentary, was a specimen of ''Thescelosaurus'', and agreed with Morris that the ankle structure was distinct, returning it to ''T. garbanii''.  Finally, they noted that another specimen, [[Royal Saskatchewan Museum|RSM]]&nbsp;P.1225.1, differed from ''T. neglectus'' in some anatomical details, and may represent a new species.  Thus, ''Thescelosaurus'' per Boyd et al. (2009) is represented by at least two, and possibly three valid species: type species ''T. neglectus'', ''T. garbanii'', and a possible unnamed species.<ref name=CABetal09/> In December [[2011 in paleontology|2011]], RSM&nbsp;P.1225.1 was finally assigned to its own species, ''Thescelosaurus assiniboiensis''. It was first named by Caleb Marshal Brown, Clint A. Boyd and Anthony P. Russell and it is known only from its [[holotype]], a small, [[articulate]]d and almost complete skeleton from the [[Frenchman Formation]] (late [[Maastrichtian]] stage) of Saskatchewan.<ref name=CMBetal2011>{{cite journal |authors=Brown; Caleb M.; Boyd, Clint A.; and Russell, Anthony P. |year=2011 |title=A new basal ornithopod dinosaur (Frenchman Formation, Saskatchewan, Canada), and implications for late Maastrichtian ornithischian diversity in North America |url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1096-3642.2011.00735.x/abstract |journal=Zoological Journal of the Linnean Society |volume=163 |issue=4 |pages=1157<U+2013>1198 |doi=10.1111/j.1096-3642.2011.00735.x }}</ref>

[[File:Thescelosaurus BW.jpg|thumb|''Thescelosaurus'' reconstruction]]
True ''Thescelosaurus'' remains are known definitely only from late [[Maastrichtian]]-age rocks, from Alberta ([[Scollard Formation]]) and [[Saskatchewan]] ([[Frenchman Formation]]), Canada, and Wyoming ([[Lance Formation]]), South Dakota ([[Hell Creek Formation]]), Montana (Hell Creek), and [[Colorado]] ([[Laramie Formation]]), USA.<ref name=CABetal09/><ref name=NSWC04/> With the exception of birds, it was one of the last extant genera of dinosaurs, its remains being found as close as 3&nbsp;meters to the boundary clay containing the [[iridium]] layer that closes the Cretaceous.<ref name=KB86>{{cite journal |doi=10.1080/02724634.1986.10011619 |last=Carpenter |first=Kenneth |authorlink=Kenneth Carpenter |coauthors=Breithaupt, Brent H. |year=1986 |title=Latest Cretaceous occurrences of nodosaurid ankylosaurs (Dinosauria, Ornithischia) in Western North America and the gradual extinction of the dinosaurs |journal=Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology |volume=6 |issue=3 |pages=251<U+2013>257 }}</ref> There are reports of teeth from older, [[Campanian]]-age rocks, particularly from the [[Dinosaur Park Formation]] of Alberta,<ref name=AS72>{{cite journal |last=Sahni |first=Ashok |year=1972 |title=The vertebrate fauna of the Judith River Formation, Montana |journal=Bulletin of the American Museum of Natural History |volume=147 |pages=321<U+2013>412 |id=http://hdl.handle.net/2246/1099 |accessdate=2007-03-10 |url=http://digitallibrary.amnh.org/dspace/bitstream/2246/1099/1/B147a06.pdf |format=free PDF, may not load }}</ref> but these specimens are not from ''Thescelosaurus'' and are much more likely those of ''[[Orodromeus]]''.<ref name=PMG95/> More specimens are known than have been officially described for this genus, such as the Triebold specimen,<ref name=TT/> which has been the source of several skeletal [[casting|casts]] for museums.

When Galton revisited ''Thescelosaurus'' and ''Bugenasaura'' in 1999, he described the dentary tooth [[University of California Museum of Paleontology|UCMP]]&nbsp;46911 from the [[Upper Jurassic]] of [[Weymouth, Dorset|Weymouth]], [[England]] as cf. ''Bugensaura''.<ref name=PMG99/> If it is indeed a tooth from a thescelosaur-like animal, this would significantly extend the [[stratigraphy|stratigraphic]] range of the group.

===Habitat===
Conflicting reports have been made as to its preferred [[habitat (ecology)|habitat]]; two papers suggest it preferred [[river|channels]] to [[floodplain]]s,<ref name=PSJNH02>Pearson, Dean A.; Schaefer, Terry; Johnson, Kirk R.; Nichols, Douglas J.; and Hunter, John P.

[[Dale Russell]], in a popular work, noted that ''Thescelosaurus'' was the most common small herbivore in the Hell Creek Formation of the [[Fort Peck, Montana|Fort Peck]] area. He described the environment of the time as a flat floodplain, with a relatively dry [[subtropics|subtropical]] climate that supported a variety of plants ranging from [[flowering plant|angiosperm]] trees, to [[Taxodium|bald cypress]], to [[fern]]s and [[ginkgo]]s.  Although most dinosaur skeletons from this area are incomplete, possibly due to the low preservation potential of forests, ''Thescelosaurus'' skeletons are much more complete, suggesting that this genus frequented stream channels. Thus when a ''Thescelosaurus'' died, it may have been in or near a river, making it easier to bury and preserve for later fossilization.

==Paleobiology==
==="Heart of stone"===
[[File:Willoheart.jpg|thumb|The possible heart of "Willo" (center)]]
In 2000, a skeleton of this genus informally known as "Willo", now on display at the [[North Carolina Museum of Natural Sciences]], was described as including the remnants of a four-chambered heart and an [[aorta]]. It had been originally unearthed in 1993 in northwestern South Dakota. The authors had found the internal detail through [[computed tomography]] (CT) imagery.  They suggested that the heart had been [[saponification|saponified]] (turned to [[adipocere|grave wax]]) under [[wikt:anaerobic|airless]] burial conditions, and then changed to [[goethite]], an [[iron|iron mineral]], by replacement of the original material. The authors interpreted the structure of the heart as indicating an elevated [[metabolism|metabolic rate]] for ''Thescelosaurus'', not [[reptile|reptilian]] [[Poikilotherm|cold-bloodedness]].<ref name=FRSBHK00/>

Their conclusions have been disputed; soon after the  initial description, other researchers published a paper where they assert that the heart is really a [[concretion]]. As they note, the anatomy given for the object is incorrect (for example, the "aorta" narrows coming into the "heart" and lacks [[artery|arteries]] coming from it), it partially engulfs one of the ribs and has an internal structure of concentric layers in some places, and another concretion is preserved behind the right leg.<ref name=RMS01>{{cite journal |last=Rowe |first=Timothy |coauthors=McBride, Earle F.; and Sereno, Paul C. |year=2001 |month=February |title=Technical comment: dinosaur with a heart of stone |journal=Science |volume=291 |issue=5505 |pages=783a |doi=10.1126/science.291.5505.783a |url=http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/291/5505/783a |accessdate=2007-03-10 |pmid=11157158 }}</ref> The original authors defended their position; they agreed that it was a type of concretion, but one that had formed around and partially preserved the more muscular portions of the heart and aorta.<ref name=RFBS01>{{cite journal |last=Russell |first=Dale A. |authorlink=Dale Russell |coauthors=Fisher, Paul E.; Barrick, Reese E.; and Stoskopf, Michael K. |year=2001 |month=February |title=Reply: dinosaur with a heart of stone |journal=Science |volume=291 |issue=5505 |pages=783a |doi=10.1126/science.291.5505.783a |url=http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/291/5505/783a  |accessdate=2007-03-10 |pmid=11157158 }}</ref>

A study published in 2011 applied multiple lines of inquiry to the question of the object's identity, including more advanced CT scanning, [[histology]], [[X-ray scattering techniques|X-ray diffraction]], [[X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy]], and [[scanning electron]] microscopy. From these methods, the authors found that: the object's internal structure does not include chambers but is made up of three unconnected areas of lower density material, and is not comparable to the structure of an [[ostrich]]'s heart; the "walls" are composed of [[sedimentary]] minerals not known to be produced in biological systems, such as goethite, [[feldspar]] minerals, [[quartz]], and [[gypsum]], as well as some plant fragments; [[carbon]], [[nitrogen]], and [[phosphorus]], [[chemical element]]s important to life, were lacking in their samples; and cardiac cellular structures were absent. There was one possible patch with animal cellular structures. The authors found their data supported identification as a concretion of sand from the burial environment, not the heart, with the possibility that isolated areas of tissues were preserved.<ref name=TCetal11>{{cite journal |last=Cleland |first=Timothy P. |coauthors=Stoskopf, Michael K.; and Schweitzer, Mary H. |title=Histological, chemical, and morphological reexamination of the "heart" of a small Late Cretaceous ''Thescelosaurus'' |journal=Naturwissenschaften |year=2011 |volume=98 |doi=10.1007/s00114-010-0760-1 |issue=3 |pages=203<U+2013>211 |pmid=21279321}}</ref>

The question of how this find reflects metabolic rate and dinosaur internal anatomy is moot, though, regardless of the object's identity.<ref name=TCetal11/> Both modern [[crocodilia]]ns and [[bird]]s, the closest living relatives of dinosaurs, have four-chambered hearts (albeit modified in crocodilians), so dinosaurs probably had them as well; the structure is not necessarily tied to metabolic rate.<ref name=CH04>Chinsamy, Anusuya; and Hillenius, Willem J.
