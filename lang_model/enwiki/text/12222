"The Sky's Lost Property"}}, is a Japanese [[manga]] series written and illustrated by [[Suu Minazuki]]. The plot revolves around Tomoki Sakurai, a highly perverted teenager, who desires to live a peaceful life, but encounters a falling girl with wings named Ikaros, who becomes his servant.

''Sora no Otoshimono'' began monthly serialization in the May 2007 issue of [[List of manga magazines|manga magazine]] ''[[Sh<U+014D>nen Ace]]''. The first ''[[tank<U+014D>bon]]'' was released by [[Kadokawa Shoten]] on September 26, 2007, with a total of 15 volumes released as of July 23, 2012. An [[anime]] adaptation produced by [[Anime International Company|AIC]] aired in Japan in 2009,<ref name="ANN-anime-news">{{cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2009-01-23/sora-no-otoshimono-manga-has-anime-in-development|title=''Sora no Otoshimono'' Manga Has Anime in Development|publisher=[[Anime News Network]]|date=January 23, 2009|accessdate=January 24, 2009}}</ref> followed with a second season, a feature film, and two video games.<ref name="film_premiere"/> A third anime season is in development for 2012.<ref name="third_season"/> The anime is licensed in North America by [[Funimation Entertainment]].

==Plot==
Tomoki Sakurai is a teenage guy whose motto is "Peace and quiet is the best", but he finds it difficult when he has to put up with Sohara Mitsuki, his next door neighbor with a killer karate chop; Eishiro Sugata, an eccentric pseudo-scientist bent on discovering the "New World"; and Mikako Satsukitane, a sadistic Student Council President. One day, while he was witnessing a strange anomaly in the sky, an UMA (Unidentified Mysterious Animal) crash-lands nearby. Tomoki discovers what fell from the sky is a winged female humanoid named Ikaros, who soon declares herself to be Tomoki's servant. From then on, more creatures known as "Angeloids" arrive, and with this, he finds himself losing his peace and quiet, but at the same time finds pleasant things the Angeloids bring him.

==Conception==
In 2006, Suu Minazuki's previous manga ''[[Judas (manga)|Judas]]'' had ceased publication in [[Kadokawa Shoten]]'s ''[[Sh<U+014D>nen Ace]]'' magazine with a total of five volumes. Minazuki had also wrapped up his fantasy harem comedy series ''[[Watashi no Messiah-sama]]'' in 2007, for which he started a sequel ''Watashi no Ky<U+016B>seishu-sama ~lacrima~'' which ran for 35 chapters in ''[[Monthly GFantasy]]'' in 2007-2008. These works were set in fantasy worlds with some references to Biblical characters and settings; Minazuki briefly alludes to the [[Tower of Babel]] in the history of the Angeloids.{{gnr|ch|10}} Minazuki's Angeloid characters and weapons in ''Sora no Otoshimono'' are primarily named after characters in Greek mythology, including their classifications sequentially pulled from the [[Greek alphabet]].

In 2008, Minazuki started a seinen water adventure series called ''Seven Ocean'', but only six chapters were published. As the publication of ''Sora no Otoshimono'' was geared for a wider shonen audience, Minazuki made some adjustments such as posting warnings to his readers to skip the chapter when it contains obvious nudity themes, and placing censor boxes and ovals over exposed body parts.{{gnr|ch|11|,|33}}

Yoshihiro Watanabe, who worked on ''Brighter than the Dawning Blue'' and ''[[Bamboo Blade]]'' handled the Character Design and served as the Chief Animation Director for the first anime series. Hisashi Saito, who also directed ''Bamboo Blade'', handled the Direction for the anime series as well as the OVA and the feature film.

:Tomoki is a teenage<ref group="note">Tomoki is 14 years old when he goes on his first date with Ikaros and Nymph.{{gnr|ch|20}}</ref> boy who wants nothing more than a peaceful and quiet life in town; however, his life is forever changed when he meets [[#Ikaros|Ikaros]], an angel-like creature that falls from the sky and becomes his servant.{{gnr|ch|1}} Despite being a shameless pervert, a trait heavily influenced by his grandfather and mother,{{gnr|ch|7|,|33|,|36|,|49|}} Tomoki is usually a kind and sincere person.

:Tomoki has a recurring dream of meeting an angel, who takes off into the sky to his disappointment.{{gnr|ch|1}}<ref group="note">According to Astraea, Tomoki has been having the recurring dream for about 11 years, but it was not taken as a threat by Synapse until Tomoki and friends visited.{{gnr|ch|22}}</ref> While taking care of Ikaros, Tomoki strives to make her behave more human, while also encouraging her to make her own decisions.{{gnr|ch|9}} While he laments the disruption of his idealistic world of peace and quiet, he admits he sees the Angeloids as family and enjoys their company.<ref group="note">The manga features a recurring gag where the main characters gather at his house for fun, and whenever Tomoki is frustrated, he comically overturns his coffee table in anger, even doing so when there are no coffee tables, during which he materializes a "coffee table of the heart".{{gnr|ch|20|,|48}}</ref>

:After learning about Synapse's quantum converter, he occasionally transforms into a female alter-ego called {{nihongo|'''Tomoko'''|<U+667A><U+5B50>}}  {{anime voices|[[Saki Fujita]]|[[Alison Viktorin]]}}. <!--- Tomoko voice actors placed here because character is not starring role like with Ranma 1/2  ---> He uses his form to mingle with other girls so he can fondle them, however, when he is excessively sexually aroused or nervous, the converter overloads and breaks down, ending the transformation. He also uses the converter to assume other forms such as water, flooring, or a bar of soap.{{gnr|ch|11|,|33}}

:Although Tomoki is {{convert|abbr=on|150|cm|ftin}} tall and weighs {{convert|49|kg|lb|abbr=on|sigfig=3}},{{gnr|ch|19}} he is usually drawn with [[super deformed]] parameters, except when he is serious or relaxed.<ref group="note">The Angeloids and other characters are occasionally presented super deformed in comical situations.</ref>

:Ikaros is a busty "Pet-Class Angeloid, Type Alpha" who falls out of the sky at the beginning of the story, and after Tomoki rescues her, forms with him a bond, symbolized by the mostly invisible chain leading from her collar to Tomoki's hand.{{gnr|ch|1}} She displays a very submissive, melancholic and subservient personality. Ikaros is able to grant wishes through the use of several techno-magical cards.{{gnr|ch|2}}<ref group="note">Each of the cards is restricted to one type of wish such as making food, making money, or changing panties. Some are limited to single use.{{gnr|ch|2|-|4}}</ref> Despite her passive appearance, Ikaros has displayed moments of aggressiveness whenever Tomoki's life appears to be in danger. Her Variable wing type is highly desired by Synapse.{{gnr|ch|14}} In the manga, she mainly does cooking for Tomoki as well as watches over him when he sleeps.

:Initially, Ikaros has a poor grasp of human emotion, due to her programmed setting of high battle abilities and high processing abilities but low emotional abilities.{{gnr|ch|22}} Despite this, she eventually develops feelings for Tomoki and falls in love. She is willing to do anything to gain Tomoki's approval including going along with his perverted schemes{{gnr|ch|2|,|16}} including sacrificing herself.<ref group="note">In one instance, she became extremely depressed when Tomoki broke the imprinting between them and finds it difficult to express her feelings (Mikako notes that Ikaros has difficulty being open with her emotions involving Tomoki unless his life is in danger) until she was ordered to throw Tomoki into the ocean. This puts enough emotional stress on her that she tearfully begs Tomoki not to throw her away.{{gnr|ch|45}}</ref> Her face is mostly expressionless, and she almost never smiles,{{gnr|ch|14|,|15}} but she loves when Tomoki pats her on the head.{{gnr|ch|43}}

:Although Ikaros claims to be a "Pet-Class" Angeloid designed for entertainment purposes, she is actually a "Strategic Battle-Class" Angeloid.{{gnr|ch|10}} She absorbs little physical damage, flies up to Mach 24, and withstands water pressure deeper than most submarines.{{gnr|ch|4|-|6}} As the {{nihongo|'''Uranus Queen'''|<U+7A7A><U+306E><U+5973><U+738B><U+FF08><U+30A6><U+30E9><U+30CC><U+30B9><U+30FB><U+30AF><U+30A4><U+30FC><U+30F3><U+FF09>|Uranusu Ku<U+012B>n}}, Ikaros is originally sent to Earth as a weapon of judgement to destroy the [[Tower of Babel]].{{gnr|ch|10}} When Ikaros enters "Battle Mode", her wings are engulfed in bright light, her eyes become red, and a halo appears over her head. Ikaros employs several types of weapons and armor: {{nihongo|Aegis|<U+30A4><U+30FC><U+30B8><U+30B9>|<U+012A>jisu}}, an energy shield; {{nihongo|Artemis|<U+30A2><U+30EB><U+30C6><U+30DF><U+30B9>|Arutemisu}}, a series of multi-directional homing energy projectiles fired from her wings; and {{nihongo|Apollon|<U+30A2><U+30DD><U+30ED><U+30F3>|Aporon}}, a bow that can fire an energy-charged arrow of mass destruction.{{gnr|ch|10|,|15}} In the anime, she also uses a structure resembling a spaceship called the {{nihongo|Uranus System|<U+30A6><U+30E9><U+30CC><U+30B9><U+30B7><U+30B9><U+30C6><U+30E0>|Uranusu Shisutemu}} equipped with {{nihongo|Hephaestus|<U+30D8><U+30FC><U+30D1><U+30A4><U+30B9><U+30C8><U+30B9>|H<U+0113>paisutosu}} cannons. In the manga, during a battle with Melan angeloid clones, Ikaros evolves into {{nihongo|'''Ikaros Version II'''|<U+30A4><U+30AB><U+30ED><U+30B9><U+3000><U+30D0><U+30FC><U+30B8><U+30E7><U+30F3><U+2161>|Ikarosu B<U+0101>jon Ts<U+016B>}}, where she gains "Dual Variable Wings", and her combat strength is doubled.{{gnr|ch|55|,|56}}

:Ikaros has a fondness for watermelons and usually is seen holding one or associating other objects and people with one.{{gnr|ch|8}} She also likes baby chickens.{{gnr|ch|15}} Ikaros's name comes from the Greek mythological character [[Icarus]], whose fate (falling from the sky) can be related to her introduction into the storyline.

:Sohara is Tomoki's childhood friend and next door neighbor who often goes to his house in the morning to wake him up.{{gnr|ch|1|,|7}} She gets annoyed whenever Tomoki acts lecherous, and regularly punishes him with karate chops.{{gnr|ch|1}} As a child, she was constantly ill and thus has few friends besides Tomoki.{{gnr|vol|6|:EX-1}} After the Angeloids arrive, Sohara helps them become accustomed to Earth life, but acts a bit jealous that Tomoki spends so much time with them. She also apparently has dreams involving her and Tomoki in provocative situations, suggesting she does not mind his lechery IF it is directed only towards herself.{{gnr|ch|18}}. She is apparently good at athletic activities,{{gnr|ch|19|,|23}} but struggles with English{{gnr|ch|12|,|26}} and is a terrible cook when it comes to sunny side up eggs.{{gnr|ch|41|,|51}}

In the chapter where Tomoki solicits Sugata's help to use a transformation card, Sugata is stated to be 15 years old.{{gnr|ch|11}}</ref>  In the anime, Sugata usually opens the episodes with some philosophical narrations referencing historical explorers such as [[Ferdinand Magellan|Magellan]] and [[Christopher Columbus|Columbus]].<ref group="note">Mikako assists Sugata with the narrations halfway through season 1 until early in season 2 until she gets bored.</ref> He is an eccentric scientist of sorts and visits Synapse by using Nymph's Dive Game portal. He lives in a tent by a river and is usually seen in his school uniform.{{gnr|ch|5}}<ref group="note">In a chapter where they visit a water park, Sugata is still wearing his school uniform and mentions he does not have any other clothes.{{gnr|ch|27}}</ref> Because of his camping lifestyle, he usually eats what he can forage and hunt in the wild, fishing and fighting off bears.{{gnr|ch|8}}
:Sugata appears to be old friends with [[#Mikako Satsukitane|Mikako Satsukitane]], who refers to him as "Ei-kun", and whose servants call him master.{{gnr|ch|8|,|26}} He behaves in a generally deadpan manner unless it involves the "New World",{{gnr|ch|11|,|50}} or if it threatens to reveal his family background.{{gnr|ch|58|,|59}}

:{{anime voices|[[Ayahi Takagaki]]|[[Jamie Marchi]]}}
:Mikako is an upperclassman to Tomoki and Mitsuki and the President of the Student Council. She is a childhood friend of Sugata, whom she refers to as "Ei-kun", and is the daughter of an influential [[Yakuza]] boss in Sorami.{{gnr|ch|8}} She is manipulative, cunning, highly intelligent, athletic,<ref group="note">In a wrestling event, although Mikako is {{convert|abbr=on|164|cm|ftin}} tall and weighs  {{convert|46|kg|lb|abbr=on|sigfig=3}}, she is able to apply a hand grip of {{convert|abbr=on|400|kg|lb|sigfig=3}} on Sugata.{{gnr|ch|19}}</ref>  and somewhat sadistic.<ref group="note">In one chapter, Mikako has to stay after school for supplementary lessons in Ethics.{{gnr|ch|26}}</ref> She initiates many schemes in the manga, usually in the form of festival competitions that place Tomoki in humiliating situations for her pleasure. However, she can be thoughtful at times: when Tomoki breaks his contract with Ikaros, Mikako mends the situation by ordering Ikaros to throw Tomoki into the ocean.{{gnr|ch|45}}

:Mikako does not have a romantic interest in Tomoki, preferring instead to direct her affections towards Sugata. In the last episode of the second anime season, Mikako tells Tomoki to choose a bride, she appears in a wedding dress and wraps her arm around Sugata's saying she is already taken. In the manga, she gets enraged when [[#Tomoyo Sakurai|Tomoki's mother]] flirts with Sugata, taking her wrath out on Tomoki.{{gnr|ch|49}}

She is introduced when she finds Ikaros on an errand and attacks her{{gnr|ch|9}}, then later mysteriously appears in Tomoki's living room casually snacking on chips.{{gnr|ch|13}}<ref group="note">In the anime, Nymph is introduced earlier in the storyline right before they go to the beach. She also participates in going to school and hangs out with Ikaros at the bath house.</ref> She has a condescending attitude towards humans, whom she refers to as "bugs", and she calls Angeloids by their types rather than their names, for example, she calls Ikaros "Alpha".{{gnr|ch|10|,|13}} Despite the attitude, she starts enjoying everyday life and her favorite hobby is eating snacks and watching [[soap opera]]s.{{gnr|ch|20}} 

:Nymph's original mission is to retrieve Ikaros and return her to Synapse, however, she is physically weaker and fails to the mission after awakening Ikaros's Uranus Queen ability,{{gnr|ch|10}} and is consequently heavily punished and abused.{{gnr|ch|12|,|13}}<ref group="note">In the manga, Nymph also carries a timed explosive device so that regardless of the results of her mission, she would be destroyed.

In both cases, her wings are consequently ripped apart by the Harpies, but Tomoki and friends manage to free her link to her master.{{gnr|ch|15}} The wings regenerate when she accepts Tomoki as her new master.{{gnr|ch|31}} However, after the regrowth, Nymph needs to go through the [[Imprinting_(psychology)|Imprinting]] process required for her master;{{gnr|ch|34}} she eventually asks Tomoki but he refuses, saying that he wanted her to live freely.{{gnr|ch|39}}

:As an Electronic Warfare-type Angeloid, Nymph's allocation of abilities emphasize her high processing capabilities and high emotional control, but her raw battle power is set low.{{gnr|ch|22}}  Nymph is able to hack computer systems as well as other Angeloids{{gnr|ch|10}} and even humans.{{gnr|ch|25|,|27}} She uses a device called the Dive Game which enables humans to enter each other's dreams and through Tomoki's dream, visit Synapse.{{gnr|ch|18}} Her "Stealth" wings appear sheer, unlike Ikaros's wings which can only retract to stubs, and she can use this as a radar.{{gnr|ch|13|,|4}}<ref group="note">Nymph's radar range is based on her wings; it weakens significantly during the time she is wingless.{{gnr|vol|6|:chapter EX}}</ref> She can also fire a high-powered energy beam from her mouth called {{nihongo|"Paradise Song"|<U+30D1><U+30E9><U+30C0><U+30A4><U+30B9><U+30BD><U+30F3><U+30B0>|Paradaisu Songu}}.{{gnr|ch|15}} During the battle with Angeloid Hiyori, Tomoki's encouragement allows her to upgrade her powers to {{nihongo|[[Aphrodite]]|<U+30A2><U+30D5><U+30ED><U+30C7><U+30A3><U+30FC><U+30C6>|Afurod<U+012B>te}}, a "fundamental particle-jamming system" that she uses to hack and free Hiyori.{{gnr|ch|40}}<ref group="note">When Nymph is in Aphrodite mode, her wings assume a butterfly shape.

She is strong in combat and emotion compared to Ikaros, but because of that allocation, her weakness is her low processing power, and the other Angeloids consider her an idiot; this is affirmed when she bungles her multilple chances to kill Tomoki at the Buddhist temple, and later at the quiz show where she cannot even answer correctly basic questions such as "what is 1+1".{{gnr|ch|22|,|26}}. She is also often found starving due to the fact that she does not know how to hunt or obtain food by her own means, resorting to eating Sugata's fish bait.{{gnr|ch|28}}.

She wields a super-osciliating photon blade called {{nihongo|[[Chrysaor]]|<U+30AF><U+30EA><U+30B5><U+30AA><U+30EB>|Kurisaoru}}, which can even penetrate Ikaros's Aegis defense system. For defense, she uses {{nihongo|Aegis L|<U+30A4><U+30FC><U+30B8><U+30B9> L|<U+012A>jisu Eru|"L" standing for "left", as it appears on her left arm}}, a shield that is more powerful than Ikaros's version, but guards a limited angle and can only be deployed for a short period.{{gnr|ch|31}} However, in her fight with [[#Ikaros Melan|Ikaros Melan]], Astraea's sword and shield are destroyed.{{gnr|ch|56|,|60}}

:Astraea is named after the Greek mythological figure [[Astraea (mythology)|Astraea]], who was a goddess of justice that later became the constellations Virgo and Libra.

:{{anime voices|[[Y<U+014D>ko Hikasa]]|[[Colleen Clinkenbeard]]}}
:Hiyori is a second-year student at Tomoki's school whose story is detailed in ''[[Heaven's Lost Property the Movie: The Angeloid of Clockwork]]''. She has feelings for Tomoki and joins the New World Discovery Club in order to get closer to him.{{gnr|ch|34}} In reality, Hiyori is an Angel who was first seen inside some sort of sleeping chamber when Sugata went to Synapse. The chamber connects her to her body on Earth, which functions like an [[avatar]].{{gnr|ch|24}} Sugata is hesitant on letting her join his club, but welcomes her anyway upon hearing the club would receive more funding. Tomoki puts Hiyori through an false initiation to assess her purity, but she innocently participates in. Thus far, only Sugata, Nymph, and Ikaros are aware of Hiyori's true identity.{{gnr|ch|35|,|38}}

:Hiyori gets rather embarrassed when it is suggested that she and Tomoki are an item; while she likes Tomoki, she has not considered dating him yet, and her presence becomes a source of major discomfort for Sohara, Nymph, and Astraea. This stems from the realization that Hiyori is always kind and caring to Tomoki, while the others seem to only see his "faults".{{gnr|ch|36}} Eventually, Hiyori manages to confess her feelings to Tomoki, which leaves him in shock as no girl has ever confessed to him before. However, her time with Tomoki was ultimately cut short when a sleepy truck driver ran her over, causing her body to disappear and her existence erased from everyone's memories (except the Angeloids and Tomoki).{{gnr|ch|36|-|38}}

:Hiyori is later converted to a "Type Zeta" Angeloid, working for [[#Master of Synpase|Master of Synapse]] to destroy the city using a [[Khakkhara|staff]] called {{nihongo|[[Demeter]]|<U+30C7><U+30E1><U+30C6><U+30EB>|Demeteru}}, which has the power to manipulate the weather, lowering the air pressure to knock Tomoki down. She is also able to counter-hack Nymph, but eventually loses when Nymph evolves into Aphrodite mode. After being freed from Master, Hiyori remains on Earth and quits the New World Discovery Club, having accomplished her goal of getting close to Tomoki, and leaves him with a farewell kiss,{{gnr|ch|40}} although she still harbors some feelings for Tomoki.{{gnr|ch|61}}

:Daedalus is an angel that frequently appears in Tomoki's dreams, but she flies away leaving Tomoki crying. She comes to his dreams asking him to help save her. Her name originates from the Greek mythological character [[Daedalus]], the father of Icarus, and her face is obscured in all of her appearances.{{gnr|ch|1|,|18}} It is later revealed she is the creator of the first generation of Angeloids including Ikaros, Nymph, and Astarea.{{gnr|ch|26}} She helps Sugata when he visits Synapse.{{gnr|ch|29|,|30}}

:The sadistic and ruthless ruler of Synapse and the series' main antagonist, Master enjoys torturing the Angeloids he owns (both physically and emotionally), seeing them as merely his playthings to which he can do with as he pleases and discarding them while considering them nothing more than trash. He is condescending towards humans, referring to them as "Downers", a trait that is also shared with his Angeloids. Though because of his arrogant ways and believing that the Angeloids that serve him will obey his every order, he always reacts surprised when he witnesses one of them break their chain or go against his orders. He is often seen on his throne with two Angeloids beside him and, like Daedalus, his face is obscured in all of his appearances.{{gnr|ch|12|-|15}} He also creates an "Ultimate Air Defense System" called {{nihongo|Zeus|<U+30BC><U+30A6><U+30B9>|Zeusu}}.{{gnr|ch|47}}

She initially appears to Tomoki as a girl in a nun's outfit.{{gnr|ch|28}} Chaos can change her appearance to mimic someone dear to her victim in order to instill turmoil and confusion (as her name implies), as she did against Nymph (and Ikaros) by taking on the likeness of Tomoki.{{gnr|ch|29}} Her "wings" are a wicked array of bladed, almost organic-like appendages. Unlike the first generation Angeloids who lack the ability to sleep, Chaos can enter another person's dream, as she has initially done with Tomoki. Chaos has a strange obsession with love, often asking the person what love is, to which Ikaros responded that love, for her, was a sensation of pain in her reactor, obviously in a figurative sense.{{gnr|ch|31}}

:Chaos's first mission is to retrieve Ikaros's core. She lures Nymph by deceptively posing as Tomoki and then orders her to kill herself.{{gnr|ch|29}} She also fights and defeats the other first generation Angeloids, except for Ikaros who sends Chaos into an ocean chasm where she was temporarily incapacitated due to the great water pressure.{{gnr|ch|31}} While there, she concludes that love equates to pain.

:In the ''Sora no Otoshimono: Forte'' anime, after Chaos is plunged into the sea, she emerges as an adult and fights Nymph and Astraea, easily overpowering them until Ikaros arrives. She was later then defeated by Astraea and Ikaros using their upgraded weapons (courtesy of Nymph) and briefly shuts down, after which Tomoki installs on her chain a padlock device given to him by Daedalus, who then restores Chaos to her child form. Chaos then joins the cast as the newest resident of Tomoki's household.

While Tomoki and Nymph were initially concerned that Mikako would abuse Oregano, they find her initially generally courteous and well-mannered, that is, until Tomoki leaves; then Oregano acts particularly vicious to Nymph by serving her vile food, insulting her, and trapping her in a cell full of ecchi animals (frogs licking, eels squirming) while dumping a bunch of grenades on her, all the while spinning the situations as if it were all Nymph's fault.{{gnr|ch|52}} She later reveals that Nymph used to visit her village and forced everyone to listen to her horrible singing.{{gnr|ch|60}}

She and her husband left Tomoki on a "world tour" when he was only 10 years old, prior to the series' start. When she reunites with her son, she harasses Astraea and some of the other girls by fondling their breasts, and then flirts with Sugata, which enrages Mikako.

In Synapse, there is a large dome that contains numerous Angels in sleeping pods, which connects them to their real-world avatars. If the avatar in the real world is killed, the people associated with them will have their memories erased, such as the case with [[#Hiyori|Hiyori]].

:The Angeloids are a series of [[gynoid]]s built by Synapse. As part of their name implies, they are modeled after the Angels and are programmed to serve their masters. They select their master through a process called "Imprinting", in which the chain attached to their neck collar extends to their chosen master's hand and ties it, connecting it to the collar.{{gnr|ch|3}} The first generation of Angeloids (Ikaros, Nymph, and Astraea) were built by Daedalus, while the second generation of Angeloids (Chaos, Hiyori, Seiren, and Ikaros Melan) were built (or in Hiyori's case, converted to) by the Master of Synapse. 

:Each Angeloid is designated with a letter of the [[Greek alphabet]], which descends for every new Angeloid built. Ikaros, the first Angeloid built, is a "Type Alpha" Angeloid, while Ikaros Melan, the most recent Angeloid, is a "Type Theta" Angeloid. Each Angeloid has their own unique abilities and powers, which are determined from three main parameters: battle capability, emotional control and processing capability. Unlike humans and Angels, Angeloids cannot sleep or have dreams, except for Chaos.<ref group="note">Chaos may be an exception to the "no dreams" rule as she can enter people's dreams.</ref> The Angeloids are able to perform other human functions such as eating and expressing emotions. With the execption of [[#Seiren|Seiren]] (and consequently Chaos), Angeloids cannot swim because their wings absorb water, causing them to sink, however, Ikaros is able to function underwater. The Angeloids' names, weapons, and abilities are primarily derived from Greek gods and mythological figures.

:A program built into certain Angeloids that allow them to learn and adapt to various environments and situations and eventually evolve into stronger beings with additional capabilities. Chaos is the first to demonstrate its ability when she absorbs Second-Generation Angeloid [[#Seiren|Seiren]] and grows amphibian wings to swim underwater. [[#Daedalus|Daedalus]] later reveals that she built the Pandora program into her First-Generation Angeloids but added a protection layer so they would not evolve "by mistake". During chapter 55, Nymph is the first one to break the protection layer and evolve her Aprodite mode, and the end of the chapter, a severely damaged Ikaros, previously assumed irrepairable with 97% of her systems damaged and her self-repair program destroyed, also activates Pandora to evolve.{{gnr|ch|55|-|56}}

==Reception==
<!--- needs manga reception section --->
Tim Jones of T.H.E.M. Anime Reviews states that the anime show "Dangles between the line of guilty pleasure and stupid, but manages to be an entertaining series all the same." and is actually funny in comparison to ''[[DearS]]'', with "decent fanservice, amusing characters, and doesn't revolve entirely around subservient alien girls", however, he is critical of the tacked on fanservice, and dislikes Mikako's terrible character, "basically a two-faced bitch" whose smirks imply a "mean-spirited, unfunny joke coming out of her mouth."<ref>{{cite web|last=Jones|first=Tim|url=http://www.themanime.org/viewreview.php?id=1233|title=Heaven's Lost Property|work=T.H.E.M.

Following the anime episode ending involving flying panties, ''[[Rocket Girls]]'' creator [[H<U+014D>suke Nojiri]] created a rubber band powered ornithopter in the shape of the panties, and posted the video on [[Nico Nico Douga]] where it soon became viral. NKH (Niconico's live streaming station) and a local school (Niconico Technical Community) then hosted a ''Sora Fes'' event on March 6, 2010, where participants built and flew model airplanes in the likeness of the flying panties. Nojiri, along with [[OpenSky M-02|OpenSky]]'s media artist Kazuhiko Hachiya, director Hisashi Saito, and TBS announcer Jun Suzuki also attended the event.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2010-01-30/sora-no-otoshimono-flying-panties-event-planned|title=Sora No Otoshimono Flying Panties Event Planned|date=2010-01-30|work=[[Anime News Network]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://en.gigazine.net/news/20100308_sorafes_flying_session/|title="Sky Full of Flying Panties" became real, Video of Flying Session in Sora-Fes!|date=2010-03-11|work=Gigazine.net}} - translated from the Japanese article posted on March 8, 2010</ref>
