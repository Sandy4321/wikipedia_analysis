(See below for disambiguation of the names [[Spanish-language surname|'''Jim<U+00E9>nez''']] and [[Portuguese surnames|'''Ximenes''']])

'''Jim<U+00E9>nez''' [archaic '''Xim<U+00E9>nez'''/'''Ximenes'''] is a [[surname]] of [[Iberian Peninsula|Iberian]] origin. Jim<U+00E9>nez is a [[patronymic]] construction from the modern-styled [[given name]] ''Jimeno'',  plus the [[Spanish language|Spanish]] [[suffix]] ''-ez'', meaning "son [of]". The English equivalent to Jim<U+00E9>nez would be '''Simonson'''. Variants of the surname include the archaic '''Xim<U+00E9>nez''', '''Jimenes''', '''Ximenes''', '''Gim<U+00E9>nez''', '''Gimenes''', as well as '''Chimeno''', and '''Semenes'''.

In Spanish [[orthography]], when the stress of a word falls on the [[penultimate]] [[syllable]] and the word ends with an "[[N]]", "[[S]]" or a [[vowel]], the word need not carry a [[diacritic]] on the vowel of the stressed syllable (in this case '''<U+00E9>''').  In [[English language|English]] orthography, all variations are commonly written without the [[diacritic]] -- Jimenez, Ximenez, Gimenez, Jimenes, Ximenes, and Gimenes.

In [[Portuguese language]] orthography, there is no [[diacritic]] used for '''Ximenes'''.

==Portuguese Descent==

When the modern name '''Ximenes''' has an ''-es'' suffix, it is almost certainly of Portuguese, [[Galician language|Galego]] or Old Spanish origin, as the orthographic change to ''-ez'' (and indeed, the consonant shift from [[X]] to [[J]]) was revised in Spain only in the late 1700s. This obviously was not the case in Portugal. 

Other languages in [[Castilian people|Castilian]]-dominated lands like [[Catalunya]], [[Galicia (Spain)]], [[Aragon]], etc. often retained the ''-es'' ending, and their descendants bear witness to this historical [[anomaly]].

The name Ximenes itself is thought to derive as both surname and place name from the common Iberian territory of [[Galicia]], since Lusophone linguists believe the [[Galician language]] is the forebear of both Modern Portuguese and Modern Spanish.

Ximenes, as such, exists most commonly in Portugal, and in all of the ex-Portuguese Crown territories, especially in Brazil. Bishop  [[Carlos Filipe Ximenes Belo]], Noble Laureate from [[East Timor]] in 1996, and Brazilian actress, [[Mariana Ximenes]], are prime examples of this historical difference.
