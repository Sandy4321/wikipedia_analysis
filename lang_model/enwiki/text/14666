The ideologist and strategist of a revolutionary movement aimed at the [[Liberation of Bulgaria]] from [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] rule, Levski founded the [[Internal Revolutionary Organisation]], a network of secret regional committees seeking to instigate a nationwide uprising.

Born in the [[Sub-Balkan valleys|sub-Balkan]] town of [[Karlovo]] to [[middle class]] parents, Levski became an [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] [[monk]] before emigrating to join both [[Bulgarian Legion]]s and several other Bulgarian revolutionary groups. It was abroad that he acquired the nickname ''Levski'', "[[Lion]]like". After working as a teacher in the Bulgarian lands, he proceeded to propagate his revolutionary ideas and developed the concept of his revolutionary organisation. In emigration, Levski helped found the [[Bulgarian Revolutionary Central Committee]], an emigrant revolutionary society. During several tours of Bulgaria, Levski established his wide network of insurrectionary committees. However, he was captured by the Ottoman authorities at an inn near [[Lovech]] and [[Capital punishment|executed]] by [[hanging]] in [[Sofia]].

Levski's gaze looked beyond the act of liberation: he envisioned a "pure and holy" Bulgarian [[republic]] of [[Egalitarianism|ethnic and religious equality]]; his concepts have been described as a struggle for [[human rights]] inspired by the progressive [[liberalism]] of the [[French Revolution]] and the [[Western Europe]]an society of the time. Levski is commemorated by numerous monuments in Bulgaria and a number of institutions bear his name; in 2007, a nationwide television poll picked him out as the greatest Bulgarian of all time.

The mature Vasil Kunchev was later described by [[Panayot Hitov]] as being [[Human height|of middle height]] and having an agile, wiry appearance. His eyes were light, greyish blue [[Eye color|in colour]]; his hair was [[blond]] and he had a small [[moustache]]. According to Hitov's same account, Vasil was a [[smoking|non-smoker]] and [[Teetotalism|abstained from drinking]]. Hitov's memories of Levski's appearance are supported by those of [[Lyuben Karavelov]] and Ivan Furnadzhiev. The only differences are that Karavelov claimed Levski was tall rather than of middle height, while Furnadzhiev noted that his moustache was light brown and his eyes appeared hazel to him.<ref>"[http://www.aba.government.bg/levski/VL_snimki.htm <U+0412><U+044A><U+043D><U+0448><U+0435><U+043D> <U+0432><U+0438><U+0434>]", ''170 <U+0433><U+043E><U+0434><U+0438><U+043D><U+0438>''.</ref>

Vasil commenced his education at a school in Karlovo and [[literacy|learned to read and write]]; while visiting the school, he also studied homespun tailoring as a local craftsman's servant. In 1855, he was taken to [[Stara Zagora]] by his uncle Basil, archimandrite and envoy of the [[Hilandar]] monastery. In Stara Zagora, he worked as Basil's servant and spent several years studying at the class school of that place. Afterward, Vasil Kunchev joined a priest training course; on 7 December 1858, he became an Orthodox [[monk]] in the [[Sopot, Bulgaria|Sopot]] monastery<ref><U+041A><U+043E><U+043D><U+0434><U+0430><U+0440><U+0435><U+0432>, pp. 27<U+2013>28.</ref> under the religious name Ignatius (<U+0418><U+0433><U+043D><U+0430><U+0442><U+0438><U+0439>, ''Ignatiy'') and in 1859 he was promoted to [[hierodeacon]].<ref name="manova" /><ref name="bakalov"><U+0411><U+0430><U+043A><U+0430><U+043B><U+043E><U+0432>.</ref> Later on, this religious service brought forth one of Kunchev's informal nicknames, ''The Deacon'' (<U+0414><U+044F><U+043A><U+043E><U+043D><U+0430>, ''Dyakona'').<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.pravoslavie.bg/content/view/9198/162/|title=<U+041B><U+0435><U+0432><U+0441><U+043A><U+0438>|date=2008-02-20|publisher=<U+041F><U+0440><U+0430><U+0432><U+043E><U+0441><U+043B><U+0430><U+0432><U+0438><U+0435> <U+0411><U+0413>|language=Bulgarian|accessdate=2008-10-25}}</ref>

=== First Bulgarian Legion and educational work ===
[[Image:Levski2.jpg|right|thumb|Levski in a [[Bulgarian Legion|First Bulgarian Legion]] uniform]]
Inspired by the revolutionary ideas of [[Georgi Sava Rakovski]], in the spring of 1862 Vasil Kunchev set off for [[Belgrade]] in the autonomous [[Principality of Serbia]]. In Belgrade, Rakovski was assembling the [[Bulgarian Legion|First Bulgarian Legion]], a military detachment formed by Bulgarian volunteers and revolutionary workers seeking to overthrow the Ottoman rule. Abandoning his service as a monk, Levski enlisted as a volunteer in the legion.<ref><U+0421><U+0442><U+043E><U+044F><U+043D><U+043E><U+0432>, pp. 45<U+2013>48.</ref> At the time, relations between the [[Serbs]] and their Ottoman suzerains were tense; after some fighting in Belgrade, the conflicts were resolved diplomatically and the First Bulgarian Legion was disbanded, under Ottoman pressure, on 12 September 1862.<ref>{{cite book | last =Trotsky  | first =Leon  |authorlink=Leon Trotsky | coauthors =Brian Pearce, George Weissman, Duncan Williams  | title =The War Correspondence of Leon Trotsky.

In the spring of 1863, Levski came back to the Bulgarian lands after a brief stay in [[Romania]].

=== Hitov's detachment and Second Bulgarian Legion ===
[[Image:Vasil Levski 1867.jpg|left|thumb|150px|Levski as the [[standard-bearer]] of [[Panayot Hitov]]'s armed detachment]]
In November 1866, Levski visited Rakovski in [[Ia<U+015F>i]]. At the time, the [[Romanians in Bulgaria|Bulgarian diaspora in Romania]] had been stirred up by the gathering of two revolutionary bands, each headed by Panayot Hitov and [[Filip Totyu]], which would invade Bulgaria seeking to instigate organised anti-Ottoman resistance. On the recommendation of Rakovski, Vasil Levski was selected as the [[standard-bearer]] of Hitov's detachment.<ref name="bio" /> In April 1867, the band crossed the [[Danube]] at [[Tutrakan]], moved through the [[Ludogorie]] region and reached the Balkan Mountains.<ref>{{cite book |title=<U+0415><U+043B><U+0435><U+043A><U+0442><U+0440><U+043E><U+043D><U+043D><U+043E> <U+0438><U+0437><U+0434><U+0430><U+043D><U+0438><U+0435> "<U+0418><U+0441><U+0442><U+043E><U+0440><U+0438><U+044F> <U+043D><U+0430> <U+0411><U+044A><U+043B><U+0433><U+0430><U+0440><U+0438><U+044F>" |language=Bulgarian |last=<U+0411><U+0430><U+043A><U+0430><U+043B><U+043E><U+0432> |first=<U+0413><U+0435><U+043E><U+0440><U+0433><U+0438> |coauthors=<U+041C><U+0438><U+043B><U+0435><U+043D> <U+041A><U+0443><U+043C><U+0430><U+043D><U+043E><U+0432> |publisher=<U+0422><U+0440><U+0443><U+0434>, <U+0421><U+0438><U+0440><U+043C><U+0430> |location=<U+0421><U+043E><U+0444><U+0438><U+044F> |year=2003 |isbn=9844830679 |chapter=<U+0425><U+0418><U+0422><U+041E><U+0412> , <U+041F><U+0430><U+043D><U+0430><U+0439><U+043E><U+0442> <U+0418><U+0432><U+0430><U+043D><U+043E><U+0432> (1830<U+2013>22.II.1918) }}</ref> After some minor fighting, the band fled to Serbia through [[Pirot]] in August.<ref><U+0421><U+0442><U+043E><U+044F><U+043D><U+043E><U+0432>, pp. 70<U+2013>72.</ref><ref><U+041A><U+043E><U+043D><U+0434><U+0430><U+0440><U+0435><U+0432>, p. 59.</ref>

In Serbia, the government was again favourable towards the Bulgarian aspirations and the Bulgarian patriots were allowed to establish in Belgrade the Second Bulgarian Legion, an organization very similar to its predecessor and sharing the same goals. Levski was a prominent member of the Legion, but between February and April 1868 suffered from a grave [[stomach|gastric]] disease and had to be operated; forced to bed, he could not participate in the Legion's training.<ref><U+041A><U+043E><U+043D><U+0434><U+0430><U+0440><U+0435><U+0432>, pp. 59<U+2013>61.</ref> As the Legion was again disbanded under political pressure, Levski attempted to reunite with his fellows, but was arrested in [[Zaje<U+010D>ar]] and briefly imprisoned.<ref name="manova" /><ref name="bio" /> Upon his release he went to Romania, where the revolutionary detachments of [[Hadzhi Dimitar]] and [[Stefan Karadzha]] were being assembled.

=== Bulgarian tours and work in Romania ===
Rejecting the emigrant detachment strategy and realizing the need for purposeful internal propaganda and the engagement of all layers of Bulgarian society for a successful revolution, Levski undertook his first tour of the Bulgarian lands. On 11 December 1868, he travelled on a [[steamship]] from [[Turnu M<U+0103>gurele]] to [[Istanbul]], from where he began his land tour which lasted until 24 February 1869, when he returned to Romania. During this canvassing and reconnaissance mission, Levski is thought to have visited Plovdiv, [[Perushtitsa]], Karlovo, Sopot, [[Kazanlak]], [[Sliven]], [[Veliko Tarnovo|Tarnovo]], [[Lovech]], [[Pleven]] and [[Nikopol, Bulgaria|Nikopol]], establishing links with local patriots.<ref name="bio" /><ref><U+041A><U+043E><U+043D><U+0434><U+0430><U+0440><U+0435><U+0432>, pp. 86<U+2013>87.</ref>

After a two-month stay in Bucharest, Vasil Levski returned to Bulgaria for a second tour, lasting between 1 May and 26 August 1869. On this tour he carried some proclamations printed in Romania by the political figure Ivan Kasabov; the proclamations legitimised Levski's activity as being in the name of a Bulgarian [[provisional government]]. During this second tour Vasil Levski travelled to Nikopol, Pleven, Karlovo, Plovdiv, [[Pazardzhik]], Perushtitsa, Stara Zagora, [[Chirpan]], Sliven, Lovech, Tarnovo, [[Gabrovo]], [[Sevlievo]] and [[Tryavna]]. According to some researchers, it was at this time that Levski established the earliest of his secret committees,<ref name="bakalov" /> but those assumptions are based on uncertain data.<ref name="bio" />

From late August 1869 to May the following year, Levski was active in the Romanian capital Bucharest. He was in contact with revolutionary writer and journalist Lyuben Karavelov, whose participation in the foundation of the [[Bulgarian Academy of Sciences|Bulgarian Literary Society]] Levski approved in writing. Karavelov's publications gathered a number of followers and brought forth the foundation of the [[Bulgarian Revolutionary Central Committee]] (BRCC), a centralised revolutionary organisation of the diaspora, of which Levski was a founding member.<ref name="manova" /> Following disagreements with some other BRCC activists over strategic issues, Levski departed from Bucharest in the spring of 1870 and proceeded to realise his concept of an internal revolutionary network.<ref name="bio" />

=== Creation of the Internal Revolutionary Organisation ===
[[Image:Levski3.jpg|left|thumb|Vasil Levski at the time of the creation of his internal revolutionary network]]
Although Levski's activities in 1870 are insufficiently documented, it is know that it took him a year and a half to establish a wide network of secret committees in many Bulgarian cities and villages. The [[Internal Revolutionary Organisation]] (IRO), as the network was named, was centred around the [[Lovech]] Central Committee, called the "BRCC in Bulgaria" or the "provisional government".<ref name="bakalov" /> Individual IRO membership was bound in secrecy: the [[initiation]] ritual involved a formal [[oath of allegiance]] over the [[Gospel]] or a [[Christian cross]], a [[gun]] and a [[knife]]; treason was punishable by death, and each member's activities were monitored by a [[secret police]].<ref name="manova" /><ref><U+0421><U+0442><U+043E><U+044F><U+043D><U+043E><U+0432>, pp. 83, 86.</ref> Relations with the revolutionary diaspora were sustained by clandestine channels of reliable people.<ref name="manova" /><ref name="bio" /> The internal correspondence employed [[encrypting]], conventional signs, fake personal and committee names.<ref name="manova" /> Although the organisation was headed by Levski himself, he had several assistants aiding him in the administrative matters; those included another monk-turned-revolutionary, [[Matey Preobrazhenski]], the venturous [[Dimitar Obshti]], and the young [[Angel Kanchev]].<ref name="bakalov" /><ref><U+0421><U+0442><U+043E><U+044F><U+043D><U+043E><U+0432>, pp. 85<U+2013>86.</ref>

The time of Levski's creation of the Internal Revolutionary Organisation is surrounded by many apocryphal and semi-legendary [[anecdote|anecdotal]] stories. Persecuted by the Ottoman authorities who offered 500 [[Turkish lira]]s for his death and 1000 for his capture, Levski was forced to use an elaborate [[disguise]] to evade arrest during his travels.<ref><U+0421><U+0442><U+043E><U+044F><U+043D><U+043E><U+0432>, p. 87.</ref> In the autumn of 1871, Levski published the ''Instruction of the Workers for the Liberation of the Bulgarian People'' together with Angel Kanchev.<ref name="bakalov" /> The document was a draft statute of the BRCC and had ideological, organisational and penal sections; it was sent out to the local committees and to the diaspora for discussion. The political and organisational experience that Levski amassed is evident from his correspondence dating to 1871<U+2013>1872; at the time, his views on the revolution had clearly matured.<ref name="bio" />

With IRO's expansion and activation, it became clear that its activities had to be better coordinated with the Bucharest-based BRCC. On Levski's initiative,<ref name="bakalov" /> a [[general assembly]] was called between 29 April and 4 May 1872. At the assembly, the delegates approved a programme and a statute, elected Lyuben Karavelov as the organisation's leader and authorised Levski as the BRCC executive body's only legitimate representative in the Bulgarian lands.<ref><U+041A><U+043E><U+043D><U+0434><U+0430><U+0440><U+0435><U+0432>, pp. 160<U+2013>161.</ref> After attending the assembly, Levski returned to Bulgaria and proceeded to reorganise IRO's internal structure<ref name="bakalov" /> in accordance with BRCC's recommendations: the Lovech Central Committee was reduced to a regular local committee and the first region-wide revolutionary centres were founded. However, the lack of funds precipitated the organisation into a crisis and Levski's one-man judgement on important matters often came to be questioned.<ref name="bio" />

=== Capture and execution ===
In that tense situation and explicitly against Levski's will and orders,<ref name="manova" /> on 22 September 1872 his assistant Dimitar Obshti plotted and carried out the robbery of an Ottoman postal convoy in the [[Arabakonak]] pass. While the robbery was successful and provided IRO with 125,000 [[groschen]], the perpetrators, including Obshti, were soon arrested by the authorities.<ref name="manova" /> The preliminary [[inquest]] and the case [[Hearing (law)|hearing]] revealed the size of the revolutionary organisation and its close relations with BRCC. Obshti and some other prisoners made a full confession and uncovered Levski's leading role.<ref name="bio" /><ref>{{cite web|url=http://liternet.bg/publish19/cv_dikovski/levski.htm|title=<U+041D><U+044F><U+043A><U+043E><U+0438> <U+0441><U+043F><U+043E><U+0440><U+043D><U+0438> <U+0444><U+0430><U+043A><U+0442><U+0438> <U+043E><U+043A><U+043E><U+043B><U+043E> <U+043F><U+0440><U+0435><U+0434><U+0430><U+0442><U+0435><U+043B><U+0441><U+0442><U+0432><U+043E><U+0442><U+043E> <U+043D><U+0430> <U+0412><U+0430><U+0441><U+0438><U+043B> <U+041B><U+0435><U+0432><U+0441><U+043A><U+0438>|last=<U+0414><U+0438><U+043A><U+043E><U+0432><U+0441><U+043A><U+0438>|first=<U+0426><U+0432><U+0435><U+0442><U+0430><U+043D>|date=2007|publisher=LiterNet|language=Bulgarian|accessdate=2008-10-24}}</ref>

Realising that he was in danger, Levski decided to flee to Romania, where he would meet Karavelov and discuss these events. First, however, he had to collect the important documentation from the committee archive in Lovech, which would constitute important evidence if seized by the Ottomans.<ref name="bakalov" /> He stayed at the [[inn]] in the village of [[Kakrina]] near the town, where he was surprised and arrested in the morning of 27 December 1872. According to some scholars, his capture was facilitated by treason; the most popularly cited traitor is the priest Krastyo Nikiforov. The betrayal of Levski is a matter of heated dispute among Bulgarian historians and writers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://synpress-classic.dveri.bg/04-2002/01-01.htm|title=<U+041A><U+0440><U+0430><U+044F><U+0442> <U+043D><U+0430> <U+0435><U+0434><U+043D><U+0430> <U+043A><U+043B><U+0435><U+0432><U+0435><U+0442><U+0430>|accessdate=2008-10-24|publisher=<U+0426><U+044A><U+0440><U+043A><U+043E><U+0432><U+0435><U+043D> <U+0432><U+0435><U+0441><U+0442><U+043D><U+0438><U+043A>|language=Bulgarian}}</ref>

Levski was convoyed to Tarnovo for interrogation and recognition and then taken to [[Sofia]], arriving on 4 January.

Some five years later, in the wake of the [[April Uprising]] of 1876, the [[Russo-Turkish War (1877<U+2013>1878)|Russo-Turkish War of 1877<U+2013>1878]] brought with it the liberation of Bulgaria from Ottoman rule. The [[Treaty of San Stefano]] of 3 March 1878 reestablished the Bulgarian state as an autonomous [[Principality of Bulgaria]] under ''[[de jure]]'' Ottoman suzerainty.<ref>Castellan, pp. 322<U+2013>324.</ref>

At the end of the 1860s, Levski developed a revolutionary theory, which meant a decisive step forward for the Bulgarian liberation movement. The theory saw the national liberation as an armed uprising of all Bulgarians in the Ottoman Empire. The insurrection was to be prepared, controlled and coordinated by a central revolutionary organisation. This organisation was to include a number of local revolutionary committees in all parts of Bulgaria and was supposed to operate fully independently from any foreign factors.<ref name="bakalov" /><ref name="echo" /> Levski's theory came as a result of the repeated failures to implement Rakovski's ideas effectively, i.e. the failure of armed detachments (<U+0447><U+0435><U+0442><U+0438>, ''cheti'') coming from neighbouring countries to provoke a general uprising leading to Bulgaria's liberation.<ref name="brit"/><ref name="bio" />

Levski also explicitly determined the future form of government in an envisioned liberated Bulgaria&nbsp;<U+2014> a [[democracy|democratic]] [[republic]],<ref name="manova" /> standing on the principles of the ''[[Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen]]''<ref name="echo" /> and the [[liberalism|liberal]] ideas of the [[French Revolution]] and the contemporary [[Western world|Western society]]:<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.segabg.com/online/article.asp?issueid=2146&sectionid=5&id=0000901|title=<U+0418><U+0434><U+0435><U+0438><U+0442><U+0435> <U+043D><U+0430> <U+041B><U+0435><U+0432><U+0441><U+043A><U+0438> <U+0438> <U+043C><U+043E><U+0434><U+0435><U+0440><U+043D><U+043E><U+0441><U+0442><U+0442><U+0430>|last=<U+0427><U+0443><U+0440><U+0435><U+0448><U+043A><U+0438>|first=<U+0421><U+0442><U+0435><U+0444><U+0430><U+043D>|date=2006-02-17|publisher=<U+0421><U+0435><U+0433><U+0430>|language=Bulgarian|accessdate=2008-10-24}}</ref> "We will be free in complete liberty where the Bulgarian lives: in Bulgaria, Thrace, [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]]; people of whatever ethnicity live in this heaven of ours, they will be equal in rights to the Bulgarian in everything.

Levski was prepared to sacrifice his life for the sake of the revolution and put Bulgaria and the Bulgarian people above anyone's personal interest: "If I shall win, I shall win for the entire people.
