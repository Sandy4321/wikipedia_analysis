'''Ralph Oliver Patt''' (5 December 1929 <U+2013> 6 October 2010) was an American jazz-guitarist who introduced [[major-thirds tuning]]. Patt's tuning simplified the learning of the [[fretboard]] and [[guitar chord|chord]]s by beginners and [[improvisation]] by advanced guitarists. He invented major-thirds tuning under the inspiration of first the [[atonal music]] of [[Arnold Schoenberg]] and second  the [[free jazz|jazz]] of [[John Coltrane]] and [[Ornette Coleman]].

He graduated with a degree in geology from the [[University of Pittsburgh]]. After his career as a guitarist, he worked as a geologist and as a hydrologist, often consulting on projects related to the [[United States Department of Energy|U.S.&nbsp;Department of Energy]].

Patt was born in [[Kittanning, Pennsylvania]] on 5 December 1929<ref name="DR"/> and studied  geology at the [[University of Pittsburgh]].<ref name="PattBio"/><ref name="Williams"/>

===Guitar music===
While in Pittsburgh, Patt studied guitar under [[Joe&nbsp;Negri]].<ref name="PattBio"/><ref name="Williams"/><ref name="PBS" group="note">[[Joe Negri]] became nationally known as the guitarist on the [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]] children's television-show [[Mr.&nbsp;Rogers' Neighborhood]], on which he also appeared as "[[Mr.&nbsp;Rogers Neighborhood#Handyman_Negri|Handyman&nbsp;Negri]]".

====Major-thirds tuning====
{{Main|Major-thirds tuning}}

Patt was inspired by the [[free jazz|jazz]] of [[Ornette&nbsp;Coleman]] and [[John&nbsp;Coltrane]] and the [[atonal music]] of [[Arnold&nbsp;Schoenberg]]. Seeking a [[guitar tuning|guitar-tuning]] that would facilitate [[improvisation]], in 1964 he introduced [[major-thirds tuning]].<ref name="Griewank1" >{{harvtxt|Griewank|2010|p=1}}</ref><ref name="Kirkeby">{{cite web|first=Ole|last=Kirkeby|year=2012|month=1&nbsp;March|title=Major&nbsp;thirds tuning|accessdate=10 June 2012|ref=harv|url=http://v3p0.m3guitar.com/|publisher=m3guitar.com|id=cited by {{harvtxt|Sethares|2011}} and {{harv|Griewank|2010|p=1}}|}}</ref><ref name="Patt">{{cite web|url=http://www.ralphpatt.com/Tune.html|first=Ralph|last=Patt|publisher=ralphpatt.com|work=Ralph&nbsp;Patt's jazz web page|title=The major&nbsp;3rd tuning|ref=harv|year=2008|month=14&nbsp;April|accessdate=10&nbsp;June 2012|id=cited by {{harvtxt|Sethares|2011}} and {{harvtxt|Griewank|2010|p=1}}}}</ref> Patt's tuning is a [[regular tunings|regular tuning]] in the sense that all of the [[interval (music)|interval]]s between its successive [[open string]]s are [[major third]]s; in contrast, the [[standard guitar-tuning]] has one major-third amid four [[perfect fourth|fourth]]s.<ref name="Sethares2001">{{harvtxt|Sethares|2001}}</ref> Patt used major-thirds tuning during all of his work as a [[session musician]] during the 1960s in New York.<ref name="Patt"/>

Major-thirds tuning packs the [[chromatic scale]] (the consecutive twelve-notes of the [[octave]]) onto four consecutive frets of three consecutive strings, an arrangement that reduces the extensions of the little and index fingers ("hand stretching").<ref>{{harvtxt|Griewank|2010|p=9}}</ref> [[major chord|Major]] and [[minor chord]]s are played on two successive frets, and so require only two fingers; other chords<U+2014>[[second chord|seconds]], [[fourth chord|fourths]], [[seventh chord|sevenths]], and [[ninth chord|ninths]]<U+2014>are played on three successive frets.<ref name="Griewank2">{{harvtxt|Griewank|2010|p=2}}</ref>  For each regular tuning,  chord patterns may be moved around the fretboard, a property that simplifies beginners' learning of chords and that simplifies advanced players' [[improvisation]].<ref name="Kirkeby"/><ref name="Regular52">{{harvtxt|Sethares|2001|p=52}}<!-- :<p>{{cite book|chapter=Regular&nbsp;tunings|title=Alternate tuning guide|first=Bill|last=Sethares|authorlink=William Sethares|year=2001|pages=52<U+2013>67|url=http://sethares.engr.wisc.edu/alternatetunings/regulartunings.pdf|format=pdf|publisher=University of Wisconsin; Department of Electrical Engineering|location=Madison, Wisconsin|ref=harv|accessdate=19 May 2012|id=[http://sethares.engr.wisc.edu/alternatetunings/alltunings.pdf 2010 ''Alternate&nbsp;tuning guide'', including a revised chapter on regular tunings]}} --></ref> In contrast, chords cannot be shifted around the fretboard in the standard tuning E-A-D-G-B-E, which requires four chord-shapes for the major chords; standard tuning has separate chord-forms for chords having their [[root note]] on the third, fourth, fifth, and sixth strings.<ref name="DenyerIntervals" >{{harvtxt|Denyer|1992|loc="The harmonic guitarist, Intervals, Fingerboard intervals", p.&nbsp;119}}<br />{{Cite book

=====Guitars with seven and eight strings=====
[[File:Eight-string acoustic-electric guitar of Ralph Patt.jpg|right|thumb|Patt played this eight-string guitar, which was tuned in major thirds.]]
Major-thirds tuning has a smaller scope than standard guitar-tuning,<ref name="Sethares2001"/> and so Patt started using [[seven-string guitar]]s, which enabled major-thirds tuning to have the E-e' range of the standard tuning. He purchased [[eight-string guitar]]s from a New&nbsp;York [[luthier]],  Jim&nbsp;DiSerio,<ref name="Patt"/> and later by Saul&nbsp;Koll (with pick-up by Bill&nbsp;Lawrence).<ref name="Patt"/><ref name="KollProfileInLutherie"/> Patt used eight-string guitars when he performed as a [[session musician]] in New York City in the 1960s.<ref name="Patt"/><ref name="KollProfileInLutherie">

====Scholarship====

Patt developed a webpage with extensive information about major-thirds tuning.<ref>{{harvtxt|Sethares|2011|loc=[http://sethares.engr.wisc.edu/alternatetunings/alternatetunings.html "Alternative tuning guide"] (html)}}</ref> This webpage was part of website with extensive information for jazz guitarists. {{anchor|The Vanilla Book}}{{anchor|Vanilla Book}}{{anchor|Vanilla book}}{{anchor|The vanilla book}}Patt's website published his ''Vanilla book'', which contains the [[chord progression]]s for four hundred [[jazz standard]]s,<ref name="Williams"/><ref name="Vanilla"/> from "[[After You've Gone (song)|After you've gone]]" to "[[Zing! Went the Strings of My Heart|Zing! went the strings]]". Its title refers to  "Just play the vanilla changes", the advice to young pianists from [[Lester Young]]. It was updated in 2008.<ref name="Vanilla">{{cite web|url=http://www.ralphpatt.com/VBook.html|first=Ralph|last=Patt|publisher=ralphpatt.com|work=Ralph&nbsp;Patt's jazz web page|title=About 'The vanilla book'|ref=harv|year=2008|month=14&nbsp;April|accessdate=31&nbsp;August2012}}</ref>

His website followed earlier contributions to guitar scholarship and instruction. In 1962, Patt wrote his  ''Guitar&nbsp;chord dictionary'' (1962).<ref>{{harvtxt|Patt|1962}}</ref> Living in New&nbsp;York City in the 1960s, he studied with [[Chuck&nbsp;Wayne]], with whom he wrote ''The guitar&nbsp;appreggio dictionary'' (1965),<ref name="PattBio"/><ref name="Williams"/><ref>{{harvtxt|Wayne|Patt|1965}}</ref> one of the bestselling titles from the music-publishing firm of [[Henry Adler]].<ref>{{cite book|title=The purchaser's guide to the music industries|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=8cAgAQAAIAAJ|year=1966|page=343|ref=harv|accessdate=5 October 2012}}</ref>

===Return to geology===
After working as a jazz musician since the 1950s, Patt returned to geology  while continuing to pursue jazz as an avocation.
