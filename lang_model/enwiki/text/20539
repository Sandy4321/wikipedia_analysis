'''Michael Jeffrey Jordan''' (born [[February 17]] [[1963]]) is a retired [[United States|American]] [[professional sports|professional]] [[basketball]] player. Widely considered<!----NOTICE: Before you changing this sentence, read the discussion on the talk page and in the talk page archives.--> one of the greatest basketball players of all time, he became one of the most effectively marketed athletes of his generation and was instrumental in popularizing the NBA ([[National Basketball Association]]) around the world in the 1980s and 1990s. 

After a standout career at the [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill|University of North Carolina]], Jordan joined the NBA's [[Chicago Bulls]] in 1984. He quickly emerged as one of the stars of the league, entertaining crowds with his prolific scoring.  His leaping ability, illustrated by performing [[slam dunk]]s from the [[foul line]] at [[Slam Dunk Contest]]s, earned him the nicknames "Air Jordan" and "His Airness."  He also gained a reputation as one of the best [[defense (sport)|defensive]] players in basketball.  In 1991, he won his first NBA championship with the Bulls, and followed that with titles in 1992 and 1993, securing a "[[three-peat]]".  Though Jordan abruptly left the NBA in October 1993 to pursue a career in [[baseball]], he rejoined the Bulls in 1995 and led them to three additional championships (1996, 1997, and 1998).  His 1995<U+2013>96 Bulls team won an NBA-record 72 regular-season games.  Jordan retired for a second time in 1999, but he returned for two more NBA seasons as a member of the [[Washington Wizards]] from 2001 to 2003.

Jordan's individual accolades and accomplishments include five NBA MVP ([[NBA Most Valuable Player Award|Most Valuable Player]]) awards, ten [[All-NBA]] First Team designations, nine [[NBA All-Defensive|All-Defensive]] First Team honors, fourteen [[NBA All-Star Game]] appearances and three All-Star MVPs, ten scoring titles, three [[steal (basketball)|steals]] titles, six [[NBA Finals Most Valuable Player Award|NBA Finals MVP awards]], and the 1988 [[NBA Defensive Player of the Year Award]].  He holds the NBA record for highest career regular season scoring average with 30.1 points per game, as well as averaging a record 33.4 points per game in the playoffs. In 1999, he was named the greatest North American athlete of the 20th century by [[ESPN]], and was second to [[Babe Ruth]] on the [[Associated Press]]'s list of athletes of the century.

Jordan is also noted for his product endorsements. He fueled the success of [[Nike, Inc.|Nike's]] [[Air Jordan]] sneakers, which were introduced in 1985 and remain popular today. Jordan also starred in the 1996 feature film ''[[Space Jam]]''. He is currently a part-owner and Managing Member of Basketball Operations of the [[Charlotte Bobcats]], which reside in his home state of [[North Carolina]].

==Early years== 
[[Image:Michael Jordan UNC Jersey cropped.jpg|thumb|185px|left| Michael Jordan's jersey in the rafters of The [[Dean Smith Center]].]]
Michael Jordan was born to [[James R. Jordan, Sr.]] and Deloris Jordan in [[Brooklyn]], [[New York City]].  His family moved to [[Wilmington, North Carolina]], when he was seven years old.<ref name=Alex>Sachare, Alex. ''The Chicago Bulls Encyclopedia''. Chicago: Contemporary Books, 1999. pgs. 172-3. ISBN 0809225158</ref>  Jordan attended [[Emsley A. Laney High School]] in Wilmington, where he anchored his athletic career by playing [[baseball]], [[American football|football]], and [[basketball]].  He tried out for the [[varsity team|varsity]] basketball team during his [[Tenth grade|sophomore]] year, but at 5&nbsp;feet 11&nbsp;inches (1.80&nbsp;m), he was deemed too short to play at that level. The following summer, however, he grew four inches (10&nbsp;cm)<ref name="nbah">[http://www.nba.com/history/players/jordan_bio.html Michael Jordan], nba.com/history, accessed [[January 15]], [[2007]].</ref> and trained rigorously.  Upon earning a spot on the varsity [[roster]], Jordan averaged 25 points per game over his final two seasons of high school play. As a [[Twelfth grade|senior]], he was selected to the [[McDonald's All-American Team]]<ref>Williams, Lena. [http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=940CE2D6133CF934A35751C1A9679C8B63 PLUS: BASKETBALL; "A McDonald's Game For Girls, Too"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', [[December 7]], [[2001]], accessed [[January 16]], [[2007]]. </ref> after averaging a [[triple-double]]: 29.2 points, 11.6 [[rebound (basketball)|rebounds]], and 10.1 [[assist (basketball)|assists]].<ref>''[[Sportscenter]]'', ''[[ESPN]]'', air date [[February 2]], [[2007]].</ref>

In 1981, Jordan earned a basketball scholarship to the [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill|University of North Carolina]], where he [[College major|majored]] in [[cultural geography]]. As a freshman in coach [[Dean Smith]]'s team-oriented system, he was named [[Atlantic Coast Conference|ACC]] Freshman of the Year as he averaged 13.4 [[points per game]] on 53.4% [[field goal percentage|shooting]].<ref name="dbb">[http://www.databasebasketball.com/players/playerpage.htm?ilkid=JORDAMI01 Michael Jordan entry], databasebasketball.com, accessed [[January 16]], [[2007]].</ref> Playing alongside All-American and future Hall of Famer [[James Worthy]], Jordan was not initially a standout player for the [[North Carolina Tar Heels]]. However, he made the game-winning jump shot in the [[1982 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament#The championship game|1982 NCAA Championship]] game against [[Georgetown Hoyas|Georgetown]], which was led by future NBA rival [[Patrick Ewing]].<ref name="nbah"/> Jordan later described this shot as the major turning point in his basketball career.<ref>qtd. in Lazenby, Roland.

Bannockburn, IL: H&S Media, 1999. pg. 128.</ref> After winning the [[Naismith College Player of the Year|Naismith]] and the [[John R. Wooden Award|Wooden College Player of the Year Awards]] in 1984, Jordan left North Carolina one year before scheduled graduation to enter the [[1984 NBA Draft]].  The [[Chicago Bulls]] selected Jordan with the third overall pick, after [[Hakeem Olajuwon]] ([[Houston Rockets]]) and [[Sam Bowie]] ([[Portland Trail Blazers]]). Jordan returned to North Carolina to complete his degree in 1986.<ref>Morris, Mike. "The Legend: A Highlight-Reel History of the NBA's Greatest Player."

==Professional sports career==
===Early career=== 
During [[1984-85 NBA season|his first season]] in the NBA, Jordan averaged 28.2 [[points per game]] (ppg) on 51.5% shooting ([[field goal percentage]]).<ref name="dbb"/> He quickly became a fan favorite even in opposing arenas,<ref name="Gross">Gross, Jane.

[http://www.nba.com/bulls/history/Chicago_Bulls_History-24393-42.html?nav=ArticleList#9]

Jordan's [[1985-86 NBA season|second season]] was cut short by a broken foot which caused him to miss 64 games. Despite Jordan's injury and a 30<U+2013>52 record,<ref name="dbbulls"/> the Bulls made the [[1986 NBA Playoffs|playoffs]]. Jordan recovered in time to participate in the playoffs and performed well upon his return. Against a 1985<U+2013>86 [[Boston Celtics]] team that is often considered one of the greatest in NBA history,<ref>[http://www.nba.com/history/toptenteams_index.html Top 10 Teams in NBA History], nba.com/history, accessed [[January 16]], [[2007]]. </ref> Jordan set the still-unbroken record for points in a playoff game with 63 in game 2.<ref name="nbagod">[http://www.nba.com/history/jordan63_moments.html God Disguised as Michael Jordan], nba.com/history, accessed [[January 17]], [[2007]]. </ref> The Celtics, however, managed to [[sweep#Sports|sweep]] the series.<ref name="nba.combio"/>

Jordan recovered completely by the 1986-87 season, and had one of the most prolific scoring seasons in NBA history. He became the only player other than [[Wilt Chamberlain]] to score 3,000 points in a season, averaging a league high 37.1 points on 48.2% shooting.<ref name="dbb"/> Despite Jordan's scoring success, [[Magic Johnson]] won the league's [[National Basketball Association Most Valuable Player Award|Most Valuable Player Award]]. The Bulls reached 40 wins,<ref name="dbbulls"/> and advanced to [[1987 NBA Playoffs|the playoffs]] for the third consecutive year. However, they were again [[sweep#Sports|swept]] by the Celtics.<ref name="nba.combio"/>

===Mid-career: Pistons roadblock===
Jordan led the league in scoring again in the [[1987-88 NBA season|1987<U+2013>88 season]], averaging 35.0 ppg on 53.5% shooting,<ref name="dbb"/> and won his first league MVP award. He was also named the [[NBA Defensive Player of the Year|Defensive Player of the Year]], a rarity for a [[Basketball#Positions and structures|guard]], as he averaged 1.6 [[block (basketball)|blocks]] and a league high 3.16 steals per game.<ref name="MJ">[http://www.nba.com/history/players/jordan_stats.html Michael Jordan statistics], nba.com/history, accessed [[January 16]], [[2007]]. </ref> The Bulls finished 50<U+2013>32,<ref name="dbbulls"/> and made it out of the first round of [[1988 NBA Playoffs|the playoffs]] for the first time in Jordan's career, as they defeated the [[Cleveland Cavaliers]] in five games.<ref>[http://www.databasebasketball.com/teams/teamscores.htm?tm=CHI&yr=1987&lg=n Chicago Bulls  1987-88 Game Log and Scores], databasebasketball.com, accessed [[January 16]], [[2007]]. </ref> However, the Bulls then lost in five games to the more experienced [[Detroit Pistons]],<ref name="nba.combio"/> who were led by [[Isiah Thomas]] and a group of physical big men known as the "[[Detroit Pistons#1980s|Bad Boys]]".

In the [[1988-89 NBA season|1988-89 season]], Jordan again led the league in scoring, averaging 32.5 ppg on 53.8% shooting from the field.<ref name="dbb"/> The Bulls finished with a 47<U+2013>35 record,<ref name="dbbulls"/> and advanced to the [[Eastern Conference (NBA)|Eastern Conference]] Finals, defeating the Knicks and Cavaliers along the way. The Cavaliers series included a career highlight for Jordan when he hit a [[The Shot|series winning shot]] over [[Craig Ehlo]] in the closing moments of the fifth and deciding game of the series. However, the Pistons again defeated the Bulls, this time in six games,<ref name="nba.combio"/> by utilizing their "[[Jordan Rules]]" method of guarding Jordan, which consisted of [[double team|double and triple teaming]] him every time he touched the ball.<ref name="nbah"/> 

The Bulls entered the [[1989-90 NBA season|1989-90 season]] as a team on the rise. With their core group of Jordan and young improving players like [[Scottie Pippen]] and [[Horace Grant]], they were becoming a more cohesive team under the guidance of new coach [[Phil Jackson]]. Jordan averaged a league leading 33.6 ppg on 52.6% shooting,<ref name="dbb"/> and led the Bulls to a 55<U+2013>27 record.<ref name="dbbulls"/> They again advanced to the Eastern Conference Finals beating the Bucks and [[Philadelphia 76ers]] en route. However, despite pushing the series to seven games, the Bulls lost to the Pistons for the third consecutive season.<ref name="nba.combio"/>

===First three-peat===
In the [[1990-91 NBA season|1990<U+2013>91 season]], Jordan won his second MVP award after averaging 31.5 ppg, 6.0 [[rebounds per game]] (rpg), and 5.5 [[assists per game]] (apg) for the regular season.<ref name="dbb"/> The Bulls finished in first place for the first time in 16 years and set a franchise record with 61 wins in the regular season.<ref name="dbbulls"/> With [[Scottie Pippen]] developing into an All-Star, the Bulls elevated their play to another level. The Bulls defeated the [[New York Knicks]] and the [[Philadelphia 76ers]] in the opening two rounds of [[1991 NBA Playoffs|the playoffs]]. They advanced to Eastern Conference Finals where their rival, the Detroit Pistons, awaited them. However, this time when the Pistons employed their "Jordan Rules" defense of doubling and triple teaming Jordan, he picked them apart with passing. Finally, the Bulls beat the Detroit Pistons in a surprising sweep.<ref>[http://www.databasebasketball.com/teams/teamscores.htm?tm=CHI&yr=1990&lg=n Chicago Bulls  1990-91 Game Log and Scores], databasebasketball.com, accessed [[March 7]], [[2007]] </ref><ref>Brown, Clifton.

The Bulls advanced to [[1991 NBA Finals|the NBA Finals]] where they beat [[Magic Johnson]] and the [[Los Angeles Lakers]] four games to one. The Bulls compiled an outstanding 15<U+2013>2 record during the playoffs.<ref>[http://www.databasebasketball.com/teams/teamscores.htm?tm=CHI&lg=N&yr=1990 Chicago Bulls  1990<U+2013>91 Game Log and Scores], databasebasketball.com, accessed [[January 16]], [[2007]]. </ref> Perhaps the best known moment of the series came in Game 2 when, attempting a dunk, Jordan avoided a potential [[Sam Perkins]] block by switching the ball from his right hand to his left in mid-air to lay the shot in.<ref>[[Michael Wilbon|Wilbon, Michael]].

[http://espn.go.com/sportscentury/features/00016048.html "Michael Jordan transcends hoops"], [[espn.com]], accessed [[March 9]], [[2007]] </ref>

Jordan and the Bulls continued their dominance in the [[1991-92 NBA season|1991<U+2013>92 season]], establishing a 67<U+2013>15 record, the best in franchise history.<ref name="dbbulls"/>  Jordan won his second consecutive MVP award with a 30.1/6.4/6.1 season.<ref name="MJ"/> After winning a physical 7-game series over the burgeoning [[New York Knicks]] in the second round of [[1992 NBA Playoffs|the playoffs]] and finishing off the Cleveland Cavaliers in the Conference Finals in 6 games, the Bulls met [[Clyde Drexler]] and the [[Portland Trail Blazers]] in [[1992 NBA Finals|the Finals]]. The media, hoping to recreate a [[Lakers-Celtics rivalry|Magic-Bird rivalry]], highlighted the similarities between "Air" Jordan and Clyde "The Glide"  during the pre-Finals hype. In the first game of the Finals, Jordan scored a Finals record 35 points in the first half, including a record matching six [[three-point field goal]]s.<ref name="NBA1991-92">[http://www.nba.com/history/jordan_92_finals.html Jordan Blazes Away From Long Range], nba.com, accessed [[March 9]], [[2007]].</ref> After the sixth three-pointer, he jogged down the court shrugging as he looked courtside. [[Marv Albert]], who broadcast the game, later stated that it was as if Jordan was saying, "I can't believe I'm doing this."<ref>[http://www.nba.com/encyclopedia/finals/Memory_Lane.html A Stroll Down Memory Lane], nba.com/history, accessed [[February 23]], [[2007]].</ref> The Bulls went on to win game one, and defeat the Blazers in six games. Jordan was named Finals MVP for the second year in a row<ref name="fnl"/> and finished the series averaging 35.8 ppg, 4.8 rpg, and 6.5 apg, while shooting 53% from the floor.<ref name="fnl"/> Drexler finished with averages of 24.8 ppg, 7.5 rpg, and 5.3 apg,<ref>[http://www.nba.com/playerfile/clyde_drexler/bio.html Clyde Drexler bio], nba.com, accessed [[February 10]], [[2007]]. </ref> but only shot 41% from the floor. 

In [[1992-93 NBA season|1992&ndash;93]], despite a 32.6/6.7/5.5 campaign,<ref name="MJ"/> Jordan's streak of consecutive MVP seasons ended as he lost the award to his friend [[Charles Barkley]]. Fittingly, Jordan and the Bulls met Barkley and his [[Phoenix Suns]] in the [[1993 NBA Finals]]. The Bulls captured their third consecutive NBA championship on a game-winning shot by [[John Paxson]] and a last-second block by [[Horace Grant]], but Jordan was once again Chicago's catalyst. He averaged a Finals-record 41.0 ppg during the six-game series,<ref>[http://www.nba.com/history/finals/19921993.html Paxson's Trey Propels Bulls Into NBA History], nba.com/history, accessed [[January 20]], [[2007]]. </ref> and became the first player in NBA history to win three straight Finals MVP awards.<ref name="fnl"/> With his third Finals triumph, Jordan capped off a seven-year run where he attained seven scoring titles and three championships, but there were signs that Jordan was tiring of his massive celebrity and all of the non-basketball hassles in his life.

===Gambling controversy===
During the Bulls' playoff run in 1993, controversy arose when Jordan was seen gambling in [[Atlantic City]] the night before a game against the New York Knicks.<ref>[[Dave Anderson (sportswriter)|Anderson, Dave]].  [http://select.nytimes.com/search/restricted/article?res=F00611FE3F540C748EDDAC0894DB494D81 "Sports of The Times; Jordan's Atlantic City Caper"], ''The New York Times'', [[May 27]], [[1993]], accessed [[March 5]], [[2007]] </ref> In that same year, he admitted to having to cover $57,000 in gambling losses,<ref name="win">Thomas, Monifa.

Regarding his gambling, Jordan stated, "Yeah, I<U+2019>ve gotten myself into situations where I would not walk away and I<U+2019>ve pushed the envelope. Is that compulsive? Yeah, it depends on how you look at it. If you<U+2019>re willing to jeopardize your livelihood and your family, then yeah."<ref name="EB">[http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2005/10/19/60minutes/main955628_page3.shtml Michael Jordan Still Flying High], cbsnews.com, [[August 20]], [[2006]], accessed [[January 15]], [[2007]]. </ref> When Bradley asked him if his gambling ever got to the level where it jeopardized his livelihood or family, Jordan replied, "No."<ref name="EB"/>

===First retirement===
On [[October 6]], [[1993]], Jordan announced his retirement, citing a loss in his desire to play the game. Jordan later stated that the murder of his father earlier in the year shaped his decision.<ref>Berkow, Ira. [http://partners.nytimes.com/library/sports/basketball/041194bkn-jordan.html "A Humbled Jordan Learns New Truths"], ''The New York Times'', [[April 11]], [[1994]], accessed [[January 16]], [[2007]]. </ref> [[James R. Jordan, Sr.]] was murdered on [[July 23]], [[1993]], at a highway rest area in [[Lumberton, North Carolina]], by two teenagers, Daniel Green and Larry Martin Demery. The assailants were traced from calls they made on James Jordan's cellular phone,<ref>Mitchell, Alison.

Jordan was close to his father; as a child he had imitated his father's proclivity to stick out his tongue while absorbed in work. He later adopted it as his own signature, displaying it each time he drove to the basket.<ref name="nbah"/> In 1996 he founded a Chicago area [[Boys & Girls Club]] and dedicated it to his father.<ref name="WP">Walsh, Edward. [http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/sports/nba/longterm/jordan/articles/chicago14.htm "On the City's West Side, Jordan's Legacy Is Hope"], ''Washington Post'', [[January 14]], [[1998]], accessed [[January 16]], [[2007]]. </ref><ref>[http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1355/is_n14_v88/ai_17210279 Michael Jordan, family attend groundbreaking ceremony for James Jordan Center], ''Jet Magazine'',  [[April 14]], [[1995]], available at findarticles.com, accessed [[January 15]], [[2007]]. </ref>  

Those close to Jordan claimed that he had been considering retirement as early as the summer of 1992, and that the added exhaustion due to the [[Dream Team (basketball)|Dream Team]] run in the [[1992 Summer Olympics|1992 Olympics]] solidified Jordan's burned-out feelings about the game and his ever-growing celebrity status. Jordan's announcement sent shock waves throughout the NBA and appeared on the front pages of newspapers around the world.<ref>Thompson, Ian and Ted Rodgers.

==="I'm back": return to the NBA===
In the [[1993-94 NBA season|1993<U+2013>94 season]], the Jordan-less Bulls notched a 55<U+2013>27 record,<ref name="dbbulls"/> and lost to the Knicks in the second round of [[1994 NBA Playoffs|the playoffs]]. But the [[1994-95 NBA season|1994<U+2013>95]] version of the Bulls was a shell of the championship squad of just two years earlier. Struggling at mid-season to ensure a spot in the playoffs, Chicago needed a lift. The lift came in early 1995, when Jordan decided to return to the NBA for the Bulls.

On [[March 18]], [[1995]], Jordan announced his return to the NBA through a two-word press release: "I'm back."<ref name="nbah"/> The next day, Jordan donned jersey number 45 (his number with the Barons), as his familiar 23 had been retired in his honor following his first retirement. He took the court with the Bulls to face the [[Indiana Pacers]] in Indianapolis, scoring 19 points in a Bulls loss.<ref> [http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1355/is_n21_v87/ai_16820794 "Michael Jordan returns to Bulls in overtime loss to Indiana Pacers - Chicago Bulls"], ''[[Jet (magazine)|Jet Magazine]]'', [[April 3]], [[1995]], available on findarticles.com, accessed [[January 15]], [[2007]]. </ref>

Although Jordan had not played in an NBA game in a year and a half, he played well upon his return, which included a game-winning jump shot (against [[Atlanta Hawks|Atlanta]] in his fourth game back), and a 55-point game against the [[New York Knicks|Knicks]] on [[March 29]], [[1995]].<ref name="nba.combio"/> The Bulls [[1995 NBA Playoffs|made the playoffs]] and advanced to the Eastern Conference Semi-finals against the [[Orlando Magic]].

Jordan averaged 31.5 points per game in that series, but Orlando prevailed in six games.

In Game 5, with the series tied 2<U+2013>2, Jordan played despite being feverish and dehydrated from a stomach virus.

===Second retirement===
Jordan's Game 6 performance seemed to be a perfect ending to his career. With [[Phil Jackson]]'s contract expiring, the pending departures of [[Scottie Pippen]] (who stated his desire to be traded during the season) and [[Dennis Rodman]] (who would sign with the [[Los Angeles Lakers]] as a free agent) looming, and being in the latter stages of an owner-induced [[lockout (industry)|lockout]] of NBA players, Jordan retired for the second time on [[January 13]], [[1999]].

===Washington Wizards comeback===

On [[September 25]], [[2001]] Jordan announced his return to professional play with the Wizards, indicating his intention to donate his salary as a player to a relief effort for the victims of the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]].<ref>[http://www.nba.com/wizards/news/WSEedfund_011016.html Pollin Establishes Education Fund], nba.com, [[September 9]], [[2002]], accessed [[January 16]], [[2007]]. </ref><ref>[http://select.nytimes.com/search/restricted/article?res=FB0A10FB385E0C758EDDA00894D9404482 News Summary], ''The New York Times'', [[September 26]], [[2001]], accessed [[March 7]], [[2007]]. </ref> In an injury-plagued [[2001-02 NBA season|2001<U+2013>02 season]], he led the team in scoring (22.9 ppg), assists (5.2 apg), and steals (1.42 spg).<ref name="nbah"/> However, injuries ended Jordan's season after only 60 games, the fewest he had played in a regular season since a broken foot cut short his season in 1985<U+2013>86.<ref name="dbb"/>

Playing in his 14th and final NBA All-Star Game in 2003, Jordan passed [[Kareem Abdul-Jabbar]] as the all-time leading scorer in All-Star game history.

Jordan scored only thirteen points in the game, and went to the bench with 4:13 remaining in the third quarter with his team trailing the [[Philadelphia 76ers]], 75-56.

After much encouragement from coach [[Doug Collins]], Jordan finally rose from the bench and re-entered the game for [[Larry Hughes]] with 2:35 remaining. At 1:45, Jordan was fouled, intentionally, by the 76ers' [[Eric Snow]], and stepped to the line to make both free throws. After the second foul shot, the 76ers in-bounded the ball to rookie [[John Salmons]], who in turn was intentionally fouled by [[Bobby Simmons]] one second later, so that Jordan could return to the bench at 1:44, amid a three-minute standing ovation from his teammates, his opponents, and a crowd of 21,257 fans.<ref name="fg"> [http://www.nba.com/games/20030416/WASPHI/recap.html Sixers Prevail in Jordan's Final Game], nba.com, [[April 16]], [[2003]], accessed [[January 16]], [[2007]].</ref>

==After retiring as a player==

After his third retirement, Jordan assumed that he would be able to return to his front office position of Director of Basketball Operations with the Wizards. However, his previous tenure in the Wizards' front office had produced the aforementioned mixed results and may have also influenced the trade of [[Richard Hamilton (basketball)|Richard "Rip" Hamilton]] for [[Jerry Stackhouse]] (although Jordan was not technically Director of Basketball Operations in 2002).<ref name="Pollin"/> On [[May 7]], [[2003]], Wizards owner [[Abe Pollin]] fired Jordan as Washington's president of basketball operations.<ref name="Pollin"/> Jordan later stated that he felt betrayed by the situation, and that if he knew he would be fired upon retiring he never would have come back to play for the Wizards.<ref name="EB"/>

Jordan featured a versatile offensive game. He was capable of aggressively slashing to the basket and drawing [[Personal foul|fouls]] from his opponents at a high rate; his 8,772 [[free throw]] attempts are ninth all time.<ref>[http://www.basketball-reference.com/leaders/FTA_career.html Career Leaders for Free Throw Attempts], basketball-reference.com, [[January 16]], [[2007]]. </ref> Jordan could also [[post up]] his opponents and score with his trademark [[fadeaway]] [[jumpshot]], using his leaping ability to "fade away" from block attempts.

His 2,514 [[steal (basketball)|steals]] are second all-time behind [[John Stockton]].<ref>[http://www.basketball-reference.com/leaders/STL_career.html Career Leaders for Steals], basketball-reference.com, accessed [[February 23]], [[2007]]. </ref> In addition he set records for [[block (basketball)|blocked shots]] by a guard,<ref>[http://www.nba.com/jordan/hoop_86-87.html What Does He Do for an Encore?], ''Hoop Magazine'', December 1987, available at nba.com, accessed [[January 16]], [[2007]]. </ref> and combined this with his ball-thieving ability to become a standout defensive player. [[Jerry West]] often stated that he was more impressed with Jordan's defensive contributions than his offensive ones.<ref name="cnnsi">[http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/basketball/nba/1999/jordan_retires/news/1999/01/13/jordan_greatest/ Michael Jordan: A tribute: Praise from his peers, NBA's 50 greatest sing MJ's praises], sportsillustrated.cnn.com, [[February 1]], [[1999]], accessed [[January 15]], [[2007]]. </ref> In 1988, Jordan won the NBA's Defensive Player of the Year Award. When he won the MVP Award in 1991, he became the first NBA player to win both awards in a career. Hakeem Olajuwon and David Robinson are the only other players to accomplish the same feat.

[[Image:Jordan by Lipofsky 16577.jpg|thumb|right|Jordan going in for a slam dunk with his signature exposed tongue.]]
:"By acclamation, Michael Jordan is the greatest basketball player of all time."
::<U+2014>introductory line of Jordan's nba.com/history biography<ref name="nbah"/>
:"There's Michael Jordan and then there is the rest of us."
::<U+2014>[[Magic Johnson]]<ref name="nbah"/>

Michael Jordan's basketball talent was clear from his rookie season.<ref name="Gross"/><ref name="Garden"/> In his first game in [[Madison Square Garden]] against the New York Knicks, Jordan received a prolonged standing ovation,<ref name="Garden"/> a rarity for a player in an opposing team's arena. After Jordan scored a playoff record 63 points against the [[Boston Celtics]] in 1986, Celtics star [[Larry Bird]] described him as "God disguised as Michael Jordan."<ref name="nbagod"/>

Jordan led the NBA in scoring in 10 seasons (NBA record) and tied [[Wilt Chamberlain]]'s record of seven consecutive scoring titles. He was also a fixture on the NBA All-Defensive Team, making the roster nine times.  Jordan also holds the top career and playoff scoring averages of 30.1 and 33.4 points per game,<ref name="nbah"/> respectively. By 1998, the season of his Finals-winning shot against the Jazz, he was well known throughout the league as a clutch performer. In the regular season, Jordan was the Bulls' primary threat in the final seconds of a close game and in the playoffs, Jordan would always demand the ball at crunch time. Jordan's total of 5,987 points in the playoffs is the highest in NBA history.<ref name="playoff history">[http://www.nba.com/history/records/alltime_playoffs_ind_career.html All-Time Playoffs Individual Career Leaders], nba.com, accessed [[5 March]] [[2007]].</ref> He retired with 32,292 points,<ref name="dbbp">[http://www.databasebasketball.com/leaders/leaderscareer.htm?stat=pts&lg=n Career Points], databasebasketball.com, accessed [[January 16]], [[2007]]. </ref> placing him third on the NBA's all-time scoring list behind [[Kareem Abdul-Jabbar]] and [[Karl Malone]].<ref name="dbbp"/>

With five regular-season MVPs, six Finals MVPs, and three All-Star MVPs, Jordan is one of the most decorated players ever to play in the NBA. Jordan finished among the top three in regular-season MVP voting a record 10 times, and was named one of the [[50 Greatest Players in NBA History]] in 1996.

Many of Jordan's contemporaries label Jordan as the greatest men's professional basketball player of all time.<ref name="cnnsi"/> An [[ESPN]] survey of journalists, athletes and other sports figures ranked Jordan the greatest North American athlete of the 20th century, above icons such as [[Babe Ruth]] and [[Muhammad Ali]].<ref>[http://espn.go.com/sportscentury/athletes.html Top N.

Jordan's athletic leaping ability, highlighted in his back-to-back [[slam dunk contest]] championships in 1987 and 1988, is credited by many with having influenced a generation of young players.<ref name="Hoop">Hubbard, Jan.

==Personal life==  
Jordan is the fourth of five children. He has two older brothers, Larry Jordan and [[James R. Jordan, Jr.]], one older sister, Deloris, and a younger sister, Roslyn. Jordan's brother James retired in 2006 as the [[Sergeant Major|Command Sergeant Major]] of the 35th Signal Brigade of the [[XVIII Airborne Corps]] in the [[United States Army|U.S. Army]].<ref>Associated Press.

He married Juanita Vanoy in September 1989, and they have two sons, [[Jeffrey Jordan|Jeffrey Michael]] and [[Marcus Jordan|Marcus James]], and a daughter, Jasmine. They filed for [[divorce]] on [[January 4]] [[2002]], citing [[irreconcilable differences]], but reconciled shortly thereafter. They filed for divorce again on [[December 29]] [[2006]] commenting that the decision was made "mutually and amicably".<ref name="Divorce">Associated Press.

On [[July 21]], [[2006]], a [[Cook County, Illinois]] judge determined that Jordan did not owe a former lover, Karla Knafel, $5 million.<ref name="KaK">Associated Press. [http://www.usatoday.com/sports/basketball/jordan/2003-06-12-jordan-knafel_x.htm "Judge says Jordan not obligated to pay ex-lover"], usatoday.com, [[June 12]], [[2003]], accessed [[January 16]], [[2007]]. </ref> Knafel claimed Jordan promised her that amount for remaining silent and agreeing not to file a [[Paternity (law)|paternity suit]] after Knafel learned she was pregnant in 1991.

As of 2007, Jordan lives in [[Highland Park, Illinois]],<ref name="Divorce"/> and both of his sons attend [[Loyola Academy]], a private [[Roman Catholic]] [[high school]] located in [[Wilmette, Illinois]].<ref>Associated Press.

==Media figure and business interests==
Jordan is one of the most marketed sports figures in history.  He has been a major spokesman for such brands as [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]], [[Coca-Cola]], [[Chevrolet]], [[Gatorade]], [[McDonald's]], [[Ball Park Franks]], [[Rayovac]], [[Wheaties]], [[Hanes]], and [[MCI Communications|MCI]].<ref name="rov">Rovell, Darren. [http://espn.go.com/sportsbusiness/s/2003/0216/1509936.html "Jordan's 10 greatest commercials ever"], espn.com, [[February 17]], [[2003]], accessed on [[January 16]], [[2007]]. </ref> Jordan has had a long relationship with Gatorade, appearing in over 20 commercials for the company since 1991, including the "Like Mike" commercials in which a song was sung by children wishing to be like Jordan.<ref name="rov"/><ref>Vancil, Mark. [http://www.nba.com/jordan/hoop_phenomenon.html "Michael Jordan: Phenomenon"], ''Hoop Magazine'', December, 1991, accessed [[March 7]], [[2007]] </ref>

[[Image:JJam.JPG|thumb|right|250px|Jordan and the Looney Tunes in ''Space Jam''.<!-- FAIR USE of JJam.JPG: see image description page at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:JJam.JPG for rationale --> ]]
Nike created a signature shoe for him, called the ''[[Air Jordan]]''. One of Jordan's more popular commercials for the shoe involved [[Spike Lee]] playing the part of [[Mars Blackmon]]. In the commercials Lee, as Blackmon, attempted to find the source of Jordan's abilities and became convinced that "it's gotta be the shoes."<ref name="rov"/> The hype and demand for the shoes even brought on a spate of "shoe-jackings" where people were robbed of their sneakers at gunpoint. Subsequently Nike spun off the Jordan line into its own division named appropriately the "Jordan Brand." The company features an impressive list of athletes and celebrities as endorsers.<ref>[http://www.forbes.com/lists/2006/53/UGGU.html "Michael Jordan"], forbes.com, accessed [[February 23]], [[2007]]. </ref><ref>[http://www.nike.com/jumpman23/home/index.jsp Team Jordan], nike.com, accessed [[January 16]], [[2007]].</ref> The brand has also sponsored college sports programs such as those of [[University of North Carolina|North Carolina]], [[University of Cincinnati|Cincinnati]], [[University of California at Berkeley|Cal]], [[St. John's University (New York City)|St. John's]], [[Georgetown University|Georgetown]], and [[North Carolina A & T University|North Carolina A & T]].

Jordan also has been connected with the [[Looney Tunes]] cartoon characters.  A Nike commercial shown during the 1993 [[Super Bowl XXVII]] featured Jordan and [[Bugs Bunny]] playing basketball against a group of Martian characters. The Super Bowl commercial inspired the 1996 live action/animated movie ''[[Space Jam]]'', which starred Michael and Bugs in a fictional story set during his first retirement.  They have subsequently appeared together in several commercials for MCI.

Jordan's income from the endorsements is estimated to be several hundred million dollars. In addition, when Jordan's power at the ticket gates was at its highest point the Bulls regularly sold out every game they played in, whether home or away.<ref>Rovell, Darren. [http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/print?id=1538744&type=story "Cashing in on the ultimate cash cow"], espn.com, [[April 15]], [[2003]], accessed [[January 16]], [[2007]].</ref> Due to this, Jordan set records in player salary by signing annual contracts worth in excess of $30 million [[United States dollar|US dollars]] per season.<ref>[http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1355/is_n17_v92/ai_19783684?lstpn=article_results&lstpc=search&lstpr=external&lstprs=other&lstwid=1&lstwn=search_results&lstwp=body_middle "Michael Jordan signs deal with Bulls worth more than $30 million"], ''[[Jet (magazine)|Jet Magazine]],'' [[September 15]], [[1997]], available online at findarticles.com, accessed [[January 16]], [[2007]].</ref>

Most of Jordan's endorsement deals, including the first deal with Nike, were engineered by his agent, [[David Falk]].<ref name=executiveofyear>Powell, Shaun. [http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1208/is_13_223/ai_54296737 "Executive privilege - sports agent David Falk"], ''[[The Sporting News]],'' [[March 29]], [[1999]], available online at findarticles.com, accessed [[July 25]], [[2007]].</ref> Jordan has said of Falk that "he's the best at what he does," and that "marketing-wise, he's great. He's the one who came up with the concept of 'Air Jordan.'"<ref>[http://www.cigaraficionado.com/Cigar/CA_Profiles/People_Profile/0,2540,115,00.html "Making Millions for NBA Stars: the High-Powered World of Super Agents David Falk, Curtis Polk and Mike Higgins"], cigaraficionado.com, accessed [[June 22]], [[2007]].</ref>
