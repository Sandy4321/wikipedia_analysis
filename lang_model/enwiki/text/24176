'''State Highway 128''' is a {{mi to km|10|precision=1|abbr=yes}}{{cref|a}} long [[state highway]] in the [[Denver]], [[Colorado]] metro area.  
==Route description==
The route begins in the west at a junction with [[Colorado State Highway 93|State Highway 93]] roughly thirteen miles south of [[Boulder, Colorado|Boulder]].  From there, the road proceeds eastward into the northern portions of the [[Denver, Colorado|Denver]] metropolitan area.  The road passes through portions of the cities of [[Superior, Colorado|Superior]], [[Broomfield, Colorado|Broomfield]], [[Northglenn, Colorado|Northglenn]], and [[Westminster, Colorado|Westminster]] and crosses [[Colorado State Highway 121|State Highway 121]] before being split by a {{mi to km|3.8|precision=1|abbr=yes}} section of concurrency with [[U.S. Highway 287 (Colorado)|U.S. Highway 287]] and again resuming its course towards its eastern terminus at exit 223 of [[Interstate 25 (Colorado)|Interstate 25]] in the city limits of Westminster.
== History ==
The route was established in the early 1920s, when it began at Federal Blvd and ended at SH 185 (now deleted). A section from [[U.S. Route 85]] to [[U.S. Route 6]] was added by 1939 and deleted by 1949. The west terminus was extended from [[U.S. Route 36]] to Indiana Street in 1965 and to its current terminus at [[Colorado State Highway 93|SH 93]] two years later.<ref name="measles">{{cite web|url=http://www.mesalek.com/colo/r120-139.html#128|title=Colorado Routes 120-139|author=Salek, Matthew E.|accessdate=2010-05-30}}</ref>

==Notes==
<div class="references-small">
{{Cnote|a|The {{mi to km|3.8|precision=1|abbr=yes}} long section of concurrency with US 287 is not maintained with state funds and therefore not considered to be part of SH 128 by the Colorado Department of Transportation.<ref name="dot"/>  There is also a brief gap of much less than a mile between the junction of SH 128 and SH 121 and the junction of SH 121 and US 287 that is not even nominally part of SH 128.  With these sections included, the total end-to-end length is almost exactly {{mi to km|14|precision=1|abbr=yes}}.}}
