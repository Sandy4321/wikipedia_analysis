[...] There are songs on this album that don<U+2019>t sound like anything else and are completely revolutionary, but I also believe that this album expresses where I am today as a woman and is an evolution of who I am. [...] I think ''Femme Fatale'' speaks for itself. [...] I think it<U+2019>s the best album I have ever made. There<U+2019>s nothing to say.
