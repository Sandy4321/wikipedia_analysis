'''State Road 5''' is a mostly-unsigned [[state highway]] in the state of [[Florida]]. It is mainly signed as [[U.S. Route 1 in Florida|US 1]] from its south end in [[Key West, Florida]] to [[Jacksonville, Florida]], and [[U.S. Route 17 in Florida|US&nbsp;17]] from Jacksonville to the [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] state line at the [[St. Marys River (Florida)|Saint Marys River]]. US&nbsp;1 is [[Florida State Road 15|SR&nbsp;15]] northwest from Jacksonville.

However, from northern [[Lantana, Florida]] through [[Lake Worth, Florida]] to [[Belvedere Road]] in [[West Palm Beach, Florida]], SR&nbsp;5 is separate from US&nbsp;1, which runs to the west on the older but wider [[Dixie Highway]]. Here, SR&nbsp;5 runs along a road named '''Olive Avenue'''.

==Route description==
SR&nbsp;5 uses the parallel Olive Avenue from just north of [[Palm Beach County Road 812|Lantana Road]] (CR&nbsp;812) in [[Lantana, Florida|Lantana]] until Belvedere Road in [[West Palm Beach, Florida|West Palm Beach]], where it turns west one block to rejoin Dixie Highway and US&nbsp;1. Olive Avenue and Dixie Highway are parallel and extremely close to each other for this entire length. Olive Avenue is also signed as Federal Highway, but this name is not used as much.

==History==
Until around 2004, Olive Avenue carried northbound US&nbsp;1 (and SR&nbsp;5) north from Belvedere Road. Olive Avenue is now a two-way city street from Belvedere Road north to [[Florida State Road 704|SR&nbsp;704]] where the [[one-way pair]] now begins, and so both directions of SR&nbsp;5 now go west one block on Belvedere Road to Dixie Highway.<ref name="FDOT GIS"/><ref>[http://www.cityofwpb.com/traffic/reports.html City of West Palm Beach: traffic reports]</ref><ref>[[Florida Department of Transportation]], [http://www.dot.state.fl.us/publicinformationoffice/construc/district4pio/palmbeach.htm District Four Construction - Palm Beach County]</ref>
