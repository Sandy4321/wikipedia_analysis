'''Avery Point Light''' or '''Avery Point Lighthouse''' is a [[lighthouse]] in [[Groton, Connecticut|Groton]], [[Connecticut]], United States, on the Avery Point Campus of the [[University of Connecticut]]. Although construction was completed in March 1943, the lighthouse was not lit until May 1944 due to concerns of possible enemy invasion. Its original light consisted of eight 200-watt bulbs that were later replaced by a flashing green light in 1960. It was deactivated on June 25, 1967, when the United States Coast Guard Training Station moved to [[Governor's Island]]. It is officially listed as the last lighthouse built in the state; the only other claimant is the replica [[Mystic Seaport Light]].

The lighthouse deteriorated until it was declared a hazard by the [[University of Connecticut]] in 1997. A restoration effort was launched in 1999 through the [[American Lighthouse Foundation]] (ALF) and in 2000 by a new local chapter, the Avery Point Lighthouse Society. The restoration of the lighthouse began in 2001 and was completed in 2006, requiring a replica lantern and extensive structural repairs and replacement of the crumbling of the blocks. Two bills for $150,000 and $100,000 were appropriated and used to complete the restoration. The relighting and re-dedication of the lighthouse was held on October 15, 2006. The lighthouse was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2002.

== Construction ==
The land upon which Avery Point Light was constructed was owned by Morton F. Plant's estate.<ref name="Dentremont">{{cite book | title=The Lighthouses of Connecticut | publisher=Commonwealth Editions | author=D'Entremont, Jeremy | year=2005 | isbn=978-1889833705}}</ref> Twenty four years after Plant's death the estate was sold to the state of Connecticut before being transferred to the U.S. Coast Guard.<ref name="Dentremont" /> The Coast Guard's deed required the construction and maintenance of beacon lights or other navigational aids as part of the Coast Guard's new training facility.<ref name="Dentremont" /> The Avery Point Light was named for Captain James Avery of [[New London, Connecticut]].<ref name="Dentremont" />

The Avery Point Light was designed by Alfred Hopkins and Associates to be a 41-foot (12 m) octagonal tower.<ref name="Dentremont" /> Construction of the tower was completed in March 1943; it is built of brown concrete blocks and topped with an octagonal wooden lantern. During the restoration effort, it was discovered that six different types of concrete blocks were used in the construction.<ref name="rest2">{{cite web | url=https://web.archive.org/web/20031205233250/http://apls.tripod.com/ | title=The Avery Point Lighthouse Society (APLS) (Archive.org capture from December 5, 2003) | publisher=Avery Point Lighthouse Society | accessdate=March 24, 2014}}</ref> The tower has a total of five windows, with two facing south and one for the north, east and west.

==Service==
The Avery Point Light was not lighted until May 2, 1944, due to concerns about possible enemy invasions by sea.<ref name=site />  D'Entremont notes that the first light, consisting of eight 200-watt bulbs, were an unusual array that created a fixed white light source.<ref name=site /> Though it never had a formal keeper, the lighthouse was tended by personnel or students from the United States Coast Guard Training Station.<ref name=site /> In 1960, the light was changed to flashing green and the candlepower rating doubled from 100 to 200.<ref name=site /> The light was deactivated on June 25, 1967 when the training facility moved from Avery Point to [[Governor's Island]].<ref name=site />

== Restoration ==
[[File:Avery Point Lighthouse 2000.jpg|left|thumb|In 2000, prior to restoration.]]
The Avery Point Light was listed by the university as being in "dangerously poor condition" by July 1997 and declared it a safety hazard.<ref name=site /> In December 2007, ''Lighthouse Digest'' included a brief article with the title "Avery Point added to Doomsday List" after rumors of it being torn down were reported.<ref name="ld">{{cite web | url=http://www.lighthousedigest.com/digest/StoryPage.cfm?StoryKey=206 | title=Avery Point added to Doomsday List | work=Lighthouse Digest | accessdate=March 24, 2014 | author=Harrison, Timothy}}</ref> The article included two images that show the blocked off lighthouse with its crumbling bricks and a sign reading "Keep Out Hazardous Area".<ref name= ld /> In 1999, fund-raising began to save and restore the lighthouse through the American Lighthouse Foundation (ALF) and in 2000 through the Avery Point Lighthouse Society (APLS), a chapter of the ALF.<ref name=site />

In 2000, the APLS website estimated $25,000 for the initial engineering study and $150,000-200,000 to complete the restoration.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://web.archive.org/web/20000823213201/http://apls.tripod.com/ | title=The Avery Point Lighthouse Society (APLS) - (Archive.org capture from August 23, 2000) | publisher=Avery Point Lighthouse Society | accessdate=March 24, 2014}}</ref> In 2001, Connecticut State Senator Catherine Cook introduced a bill for $150,000 in bonds to fund the restoration of the Avery Point Light;<ref>{{cite web | url=https://web.archive.org/web/20010302071141/http://apls.tripod.com/ | title=The Avery Point Lighthouse Society (APLS) - (Archive.org capture from March 2, 2001) | publisher=Avery Point Lighthouse Society | accessdate=March 24, 2014}}</ref> it was later approved.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://web.archive.org/web/20011130165143/http://apls.tripod.com/ | title=The Avery Point Lighthouse Society (APLS) - (Archive.org capture from November 30, 2001)| publisher=The Avery Point Lighthouse Society | accessdate=March 24, 2014}}</ref> An article in the ''New London Day'' also noted an engineering study valued at $40,000 was being conducted for no cost by James Nordon's engineering firm of Gibble, Norden and Champion.<ref name=day>{{cite news | url=https://web.archive.org/web/20010615164106/http://apls.tripod.com/documentscans/day020501.jpg | title=Local lawmakers to seek lighthouse funds | work=New London Day | date=5 February 2001 | accessdate=March 24, 2014}}</ref>

On December 1, 2001, the first part of the restoration began with the removal of the lantern.<ref name=site />  Due the deterioration of the lantern, the decision was made to make a replica of the original lantern.<ref name=site />  From 2003 through 2004, the West Mystic Wooden Boat Building Company, donated the materials and labor to construct the replica.<ref name=site />  The company's owner, Steve Jones, has close ties to the Avery Point Light; he is a former lighthouse keeper for the [[Harbor of Refuge Light]] in [[Lewes, Delaware]] and is also a University of Connecticut professor.<ref name=site />

The concrete blocks used in the construction were of poor construction due to the high sand content that crumbled with the expanding and contraction of the mortar.<ref name=site /> The decision was made to replace the outer face of the concrete blocks and strengthen the remaining original blocks with cement and steel reinforcements.<ref name=site /> A total of 3,000 blocks were needed to complete the restoration and had to be produced using special molds.<ref name=rest2 /> The restoration work on the tower began in September 2003.<ref name=site /> Though increased costs of the restoration resulted in another need of funding to complete the project. In 2003, federal funding for another $100,000 came from the [[National Park Service]]{{'}}s "Save America<U+2019>s Treasures Act" and it was endorsed by Senators [[Christopher Dodd]] and [[Joseph Lieberman]].<ref name="effort">{{cite web | url=http://www.averypointlight.com/RestorationEfforts.htm | title=Restoration Efforts  and The Avery Point Lighthouse Society | publisher=Avery Point Lighthouse Society | accessdate=March 24, 2014}}</ref> Delays in the appropriation of funding delayed the second phase of the structural restoration until June 2005; and the work was conducted from July through early November.<ref name=effort /> The relighting and re-dedication of the lighthouse was held on October 15, 2006.<ref name=site />

== Importance ==
The lighthouse has been claimed to be a memorial tower in various sources, including the 1994 ''America's Atlantic Coast Lighthouses: A Traveler's Guide'' which states "the tower was built as a memorial tower and as a symbolic representation of the USCG lighthouse keeping responsibilities."<ref name="Dentremont" /> D'Entremont notes that the misunderstanding stems from an article from 1955 in ''U.S. Coast Guard Magazine'' and acknowledges that it has come to serve as a memorial.<ref name="Dentremont" /> The lighthouse was added to the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 2002.<ref name="nris"/><ref name="nrhpinv3">{{cite web|url=http://pdfhost.focus.nps.gov/docs/NRHP/Text/02000866.pdf |title=National Register of Historic Places Registration: Avery Point Lighthouse |date=December 6, 2001 |author=Bruce Clouette |publisher=National Park Service}} and [http://pdfhost.focus.nps.gov/docs/NRHP/Photos/02000866.pdf ''Accompanying 16 photos, both standing and disassembled, exterior and interior, 2001 and undated'']</ref>
