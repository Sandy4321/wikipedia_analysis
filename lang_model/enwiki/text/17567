'''Rosetta@home''' is a [[distributed computing]] project for [[protein structure prediction]] on the [[Berkeley Open Infrastructure for Network Computing]] (BOINC) platform, run by the [[David Baker (biochemist)|Baker laboratory]] at the [[University of Washington]]. Rosetta@home also aims to predict [[protein-protein docking]] and [[Protein design| design new proteins]] with the help of over 86,000 volunteered computers processing over 68&nbsp;[[teraFLOPS]] on average as of September 7, 2008.<!--the problem here is that the reference has already been updated, and so no longer justifies the statement in the text, which is already out of date--><ref name="BOINCstats_RosettaOverview">{{cite web | title= Rosetta@home: Credit overview | author=de Zutter W | url=http://boincstats.com/stats/project_graph.php?pr=rosetta |publisher=boincstats.com| accessmonthday=October 7 |accessyear=2008}}</ref> Though much of the project is oriented towards [[Research#Basic_research | basic research]] on improving the accuracy and robustness of the [[proteomics]] methods, Rosetta@home also does applied research on [[malaria]], [[Alzheimer's disease]] and other pathologies.<ref>{{cite web | title=What is Rosetta@home? |work=Rosetta@home forums| publisher=University of Washington | accessmonthday=September 7 |accessyear=2008| url=http://boinc.bakerlab.org/rosetta/rah_about.php}}</ref>

Like all BOINC projects, Rosetta@home uses idle computer processing resources from volunteers' computers to perform calculations on individual [[BOINC_client-server_technology | workunits]]. Completed results are sent to a central project [[server]] where they are validated and assimilated into project [[database]]s.  The project is [[cross-platform]], and runs on a wide variety of [[hardware]] configurations.  Users can view the progress of their individual protein structure prediction on the Rosetta@home [[screensaver]].

In addition to disease-related research, the Rosetta@home network serves as a testing framework for new methods in [[structural bioinformatics]].  These new methods are then used in other Rosetta-based applications, like [[Rosetta%40home#RosettaDock | RosettaDock]] and the [[Human Proteome Folding Project]], after being sufficiently developed and proven stable on Rosetta@home's large and diverse collection of volunteer computers.  Two particularly important tests for the new methods developed in Rosetta@home are the [[Critical Assessment of Techniques for Protein Structure Prediction]] (CASP) and [[Critical Assessment of Prediction of Interactions]] (CAPRI) experiments, biannual experiments which evaluate the [[state of the art]] in protein structure prediction and protein-protein docking prediction, respectively.  Rosetta@home consistently ranks among the foremost docking predictors, and is one of the best [[tertiary structure]] predictors available.<ref name="CAPRI3">{{cite journal |author=Lensink MF, M<U+00E9>ndez R, Wodak SJ |title=Docking and scoring protein complexes: CAPRI 3rd Edition |journal=Proteins |volume=69 |issue=4 |pages=704<U+2013>18 |year=2007 |month=December |pmid=17918726 |doi=10.1002/prot.21804 |url=}}</ref>

A primary feature of the Rosetta@home [[graphical user interface]] (GUI) is a [[screensaver]] which shows a current [[BOINC_client-server_technology | workunit]]'s progress during the simulated [[protein folding]] process.  In the upper-left  of the current screensaver, the target protein is shown adopting different shapes (conformations) in its search for the lowest energy structure.  Depicted immediately to the right is the structure of the most recently accepted.  On the upper right the lowest energy conformation of the current decoy is shown; below that is the true, or native, structure of the protein if it has already been determined.  Three graphs are  included in the screensaver.  Towards the middle of it a graph for the accept model's [[Thermodynamic free energy|free energy]] is displayed, which fluctuates as the accepted model changes.  A graph of the accepted model's [[root mean square deviation]] (RMSD), which measures how structurally similar the accepted model is to the native model, is shown  far right.  On the right of the accepted energy graph and below the RMSD graph, the results from these two functions are used to produce an energy vs. RMSD plot as the model is progressively refined.<ref>{{cite web |title= Rosetta@home: Quick guide to Rosetta and its graphics |work= Rosetta@home |publisher= University of Washington |accessmonthday=October 7 |accessyear=2008 |year= 2007 | url=http://boinc.bakerlab.org/rosetta/rah_graphics.php}}</ref>

Like all BOINC projects, Rosetta@home runs in the background of the user's computer using idle computer power, either at or before logging in to an account on the host [[operating system]].  Rosetta@home frees resources from the CPU as they are required by other applications so that normal computer usage is unaffected.  To minimize power consumption or heat production from a computer running at sustained capacity, the maximum percentage of CPU resources that Rosetta@home is allowed to use can be specified through a user's account preferences.  The times of day during which Rosetta@home is allowed to do work can also be adjusted, along with many other preferences, through a user's account settings.  

Rosetta, the software run on the Rosetta@home network, was rewritten in [[C++]] to allow easier development than that offered by its original version, which was written in [[Fortran]].  This new version is [[object-oriented]], and was released on February 8, 2008.<ref name="oldNews"/><ref>{{cite web |title= Rosetta@home: Problems with minirosetta version 1.+ (Message 51199) | author= Kim DE|work=Rosetta@home forums |publisher= University of Washington |year= 2008 |accessmonthday=September 7 |accessyear=2008|url= http://boinc.bakerlab.org/rosetta/forum_thread.php?id=3934&nowrap=true#51199 }}</ref>  Development of the Rosetta code is done by Rosetta Commons.<ref name="rosettaCommons">{{cite web|title= Rosetta Commons | publisher=RosettaCommons.org |year= 2008 |accessmonthday=October 7 |accessyear=2008|url= http://www.rosettacommons.org/main.html}}</ref>  The software is freely licensed to the academic community and available to pharmaceutical companies for a fee.<ref name="rosettaCommons"/>

== Project significance ==
{{further| [[Protein structure prediction]], [[Protein docking]], [[Protein design]]}}

With the proliferation of [[List_of_sequenced_eukaryotic_genomes | genome sequencing projects]], scientists can infer the amino acid sequence, or [[primary structure]], of many proteins that carry out functions within the cell.  To better understand a protein's function and aid in [[Drug_design#Rational_drug_design | rational drug design]], scientists need to know the protein's 3-dimensional, [[tertiary structure]].

Rosetta produced a model for T0281 ([[Protein structural alignment|superpositioned]] in magenta) 1.5 [[<U+00C5>]]&nbsp;[[RMSD]] from the crystal structure (blue).]]

Protein 3D structures are currently determined experimentally through [[X-ray crystallography]] or [[nuclear magnetic resonance]] (NMR) spectroscopy. The process is slow (it can take weeks or even months to figure out how to crystallize a protein for the first time) and comes at high cost (around $100,000&nbsp;USD per protein).<ref>{{cite book |title= Structural Bioinformatics |editor= Bourne PE, Helge W| year=2003 |location= Hoboken, NJ | publisher=Wiley-Liss | isbn= 978-0471201991 |oclc= 50199108 }}</ref><!--this is where cite book is a rubbish template, but there we go...

Progress in protein structure prediction is evaluated in the biannual [[Critical Assessment of Techniques for Protein Structure Prediction]] (CASP) experiment, in which researchers from around the world attempt to derive a protein's structure from the protein's amino acid sequence.  High scoring groups in this sometimes competitive experiment are considered the ''[[de facto]]'' standard-bearers for what is the state of the art in protein structure prediction.  Rosetta, the program on which Rosetta@home is based, has been used since CASP&nbsp;5 in 2002.  In the 2004 CASP&nbsp;6 experiment, Rosetta made history by being the first to produce a close to atomic-level resolution, [[Protein folding#Computational prediction of protein tertiary structure | ab initio]]<!--looks like an Easter Egg link--> protein structure prediction in its submitted model for CASP target T0281.<ref name="R@H_ResearchOverview">{{cite web | work=Rosetta@home |title= Rosetta@home: Research Overview | publisher=University of Washington |year= 2007 |accessmonthday=October 7 |accessyear=2008|url= http://boinc.bakerlab.org/rosetta/rah_research.php }}</ref>  ''Ab initio'' modeling is considered an especially difficult category of protein structure prediction, as it does not use information from [[structural alignment| structural homology]] and must rely on information from [[multiple sequence alignment| sequence homology]] and modeling physical interactions within the protein.

Rosetta@home is also used in [[Protein-protein_docking | protein docking]] prediction, which determines the structure of multiple [[Protein_complex | complexed proteins]], or [[quaternary structure]].  This type of [[Protein-protein_interaction | protein interaction]] affects many cellular functions, including antigen-antibody and enzyme-inhibitor binding and cellular import and export.  Determining these interactions is critical for [[drug design]].  Rosetta is used in the [[Critical Assessment of Prediction of Interactions]] (CAPRI) experiment, which evaluates the state of the protein docking field similar to how CASP gauges progress in protein structure prediction.

==Development history and branches==
Originally introduced by the Baker laboratory in 1998 as an ab initio approach to structure prediction,<ref>{{cite journal |author=Simons KT, Bonneau R, Ruczinski I, Baker D |title=Ab initio protein structure prediction of CASP III targets using ROSETTA |journal=Proteins |volume=Suppl 3 |issue= |pages=171<U+2013>6 |year=1999 |pmid=10526365 |doi= |url=}}</ref> Rosetta has since branched into several development streams and distinct services.  More than seven&nbsp;years after Rosetta's first appearance, the Rosetta@home project was released (i.e. announced as no longer [[Development_stage#Beta | beta]]) on October 6, 2005.<ref name="oldNews"/>  Many of the graduate students and other researchers involved in Rosetta's initial development have since moved to other universities and research institutions, and subsequently enhanced different parts of the Rosetta project.

===RosettaDesign===
[[Image:TOP7-rosetta_superposition.png | right | thumb | Superposition of Rosetta-designed model (red) for TOP7 onto its X-ray crystal structure (blue, PDB ID: 1QYS)]]
RosettaDesign, a computational approach to protein design based on Rosetta, began in 2000 with a study in redesigning the folding pathway of [[Protein G| protein G]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Nauli S, Kuhlman B, Baker D |title=Computer-based redesign of a protein folding pathway |journal=Nature structural biology |volume=8 |issue=7 |pages=602<U+2013>5 |year=2001 |month=July |pmid=11427890 |doi=10.1038/89638 |url=}}</ref>  In 2002 RosettaDesign was used to design TOP7, a 93-amino acid long [[<U+0391>/<U+03B2> proteins| &alpha;/&beta;]] protein that had an overall [[Structural Classification of Proteins| fold]] never before recorded in nature.  This new conformation was predicted by Rosetta to within 1.2&nbsp;[[<U+00C5>]] [[RMSD]] of the structure determined by [[X-ray crystallography]], representing an unusually accurate structure prediction.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Kuhlman B, Dantas G, Ireton GC, Varani G, Stoddard BL, Baker D |title=Design of a novel globular protein fold with atomic-level accuracy |journal=Science (New York, N.Y.) |volume=302 |issue=5649 |pages=1364<U+2013>8 |year=2003 |month=November |pmid=14631033 |doi=10.1126/science.1089427 |url=}}</ref>  Rosetta and RosettaDesign earned widespread recognition by being the first to design and accurately predict the structure of a novel protein of such length, as reflected by the 2002 paper describing the dual approach prompting two positive letters in the journal [[Science (journal)| ''Science'']],<ref>{{cite journal |author=Jones DT |title=Structural biology.

===RosettaDock===
RosettaDock was added to the Rosetta software suite during the first [[CAPRI]] experiment in 2002 as the Baker laboratory's [[algorithm]] for [[protein-protein docking]] prediction.<ref name="CAPRI_1">{{cite journal |author=Gray JJ, Moughon SE, Kortemme T, ''et al'' |title=Protein-protein docking predictions for the CAPRI experiment |journal=Proteins |volume=52 |issue=1 |pages=118<U+2013>22 |year=2003 |month=July |pmid=12784377 |doi=10.1002/prot.10384 |url=}}</ref>  In that experiment, RosettaDock made a high-accuracy prediction for the docking between [[Streptococcus_pyogenes#Virulence_factors | streptococcal pyogenic exotoxin A]] and a [[T_cell_receptor#Structural_characteristics_of_the_TCR | T cell-receptor &beta;-chain]], and a medium accuracy prediction for a complex between [[porcine]] [[<U+03B1>-amylase]] and a [[camelid]] [[antibody]].  While the RosettaDock method only made two acceptably accurate predictions out of seven possible, this was enough to rank it seventh out of nineteen prediction methods in the first CAPRI assessment.<ref name="CAPRI_1"/>

Development of RosettaDock diverged into two branches for subsequent CAPRI rounds as Jeffrey Gray, who laid the groundwork for RosettaDock while at the [[University of Washington]], continued working on the method in his new position at [[John Hopkins University]]. Members of the Baker laboratory further developed RosettaDock in Gray's absence.  The two versions differed slightly in side-chain modeling, decoy selection and other areas.<ref name="Schueler-Furman"/><ref>{{cite journal | title=CAPRI rounds 3-5 reveal promising successes and future challenges for RosettaDock | author=Daily MD, Masica D, Sivasubramanian A, Somarouthu S, Gray JJ| journal=Proteins | year=2005 | volume=60 | issue=2 | pages=181<U+2013>86 | url=http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/cgi-bin/fulltext/110548131/HTMLSTART | doi=10.1002/prot.20555|pmid=15981262}}</ref> Despite these differences, both the Baker and Gray methods performed well in the second CAPRI assessment, placing fifth and seventh respectively out of 30 predictor groups.<ref>{{cite journal | title=Assessment of CAPRI predictions in rounds 3-5 shows progress in docking procedures | author=M<U+00E9>ndez R, Leplae R, Lensink MF, Wodak SJ| journal=Proteins | year=2005 | volume=60 | issue=2 | pages=150<U+2013>69 | url=http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/cgi-bin/fulltext/110548130/HTMLSTART | doi=10.1002/prot.20551|pmid=15981261}}</ref>  Jeffrey Gray's RosettaDock server is available as a free docking prediction service for non-commercial use.<ref>{{cite web | title=RosettaDock server | work=Gray laboratory | publisher=Johns Hopkins University | accessmonthday=September 7 |accessyear=2008| url=http://rosettadock.graylab.jhu.edu/}}</ref>

In October 2006, RosettaDock was integrated into Rosetta@home.  The method used a fast, crude docking model phase using only the [[Protein_structural_alignment#Types_of_comparisons | protein backbone]].  This was followed by a slow full-atom refinement phase in which the orientation of the two interacting proteins relative to each other, and side-chain interactions at the protein-protein interface, were simultaneously optimized to find the lowest energy conformation.<ref>{{cite web | work=Rosetta@home forums |title= Protein-protein docking at Rosetta@home | publisher=University of Washington | accessmonthday=September 7 |accessyear=2008| url=http://boinc.bakerlab.org/rosetta/forum_thread.php?id=2395}}</ref>  The vastly increased computational power afforded by the Rosetta@home network, in combination with revised "fold-tree" representations for backbone flexibility and [[loop modeling]], made RosettaDock sixth out of 63 prediction groups in the third CAPRI assessment.<ref name="CAPRI3"/><ref name="CAPRI3_1"/>

===Robetta===
The Robetta server is an automated protein structure prediction service offered by the Baker laboratory for non-commercial ''ab initio'' and comparative modeling.<ref>{{cite web | title=Robetta web server | work=Baker laboratory | publisher=University of Washington | accessmonthday=September 7 |accessyear=2008| url=http://robetta.bakerlab.org/}}</ref>  It has participated as an automated prediction server in the biannual [[CASP]] experiments since CASP 5 in 2002, performing among the best in the automated server prediction category.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Aloy P, Stark A, Hadley C, Russell RB |title=Predictions without templates: new folds, secondary structure, and contacts in CASP5 |journal=Proteins |volume=53 Suppl 6 |issue= |pages=436<U+2013>56 |year=2003 |pmid=14579333 |doi=10.1002/prot.10546 |url=}}</ref> Robetta has since competed in CASP 6 and 7, where it did better than average among both automated server and human predictor groups.<ref name="CASP7Assessment"/><ref>{{cite journal |author=Tress M, Ezkurdia I, Gra<U+00F1>a O, L<U+00F3>pez G, Valencia A |title=Assessment of predictions submitted for the CASP6 comparative modeling category |journal=Proteins |volume=61 Suppl 7 |issue= |pages=27<U+2013>45 |year=2005 |pmid=16187345 |doi=10.1002/prot.20720 |url=}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Battey JN, Kopp J, Bordoli L, Read RJ, Clarke ND, Schwede T |title=Automated server predictions in CASP7 |journal=Proteins |volume=69 Suppl 8 |issue= |pages=68<U+2013>82 |year=2007 |pmid=17894354 |doi=10.1002/prot.21761 |url=}}</ref>

In modeling protein structure as of CASP 6, Robetta first searches for structural homologs using [[BLAST]], [[PSI-BLAST]], and [[3D-Jury]], then parses the target sequence into its individual [[Protein domain| domains]], or independently folding units of proteins, by matching the sequence to structural families in the [[Pfam| Pfam database]].  Domains with structural homologs then follow a "template-based model" (i.e., [[homology modeling]]) protocol.  Here, the Baker laboratory's in-house alignment program, K*sync, produces a group of sequence homologs, and each of these is modeled by the Rosetta ''de novo'' method to produce a decoy (possible structure).  The final structure prediction is selected by taking the [[Thermodynamic free energy| lowest energy]] model as determined by a low-resolution Rosetta energy function.  For domains that have no detected structural homologs, a ''de novo'' protocol is followed in which the lowest energy model from a set of generated decoys is selected as the final prediction.  These domain predictions are then connected together to investigate inter-domain, tertiary-level interactions within the protein.  Finally, side-chain contributions are modeled using a protocol for [[Monte Carlo method| Monte Carlo]] conformational search.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Chivian D, Kim DE, Malmstr<U+00F6>m L, Schonbrun J, Rohl CA, Baker D |title=Prediction of CASP6 structures using automated Robetta protocols |journal=Proteins |volume=61 Suppl 7 |issue= |pages=157<U+2013>66 |year=2005 |pmid=16187358 |doi=10.1002/prot.20733 |url=}}</ref>

In CASP 8, Robetta was augmented to use Rosetta's high resolution all-atom refinement method,<ref>{{cite web | title=David Baker's Rosetta@home journal, message 52902 | author=Baker D| work=Rosetta@home forums | publisher=University of Washington | accessmonthday=September 7 |accessyear=2008| url=http://boinc.bakerlab.org/rosetta/forum_thread.php?id=1177&nowrap=true#52902}}</ref> the absence of which was cited as the main cause for Robetta being less accurate than the Rosetta@home network in CASP 7.<ref name="CASP7_baker"/>

===Foldit===
On May 9, 2008, after Rosetta@home users suggested an interactive version of the [[distributed computing]] program, the Baker lab publicly released [[Foldit]], an online protein structure prediction game based on the Rosetta platform.<ref>{{cite web | title=David Baker's Rosetta@home journal (message 52963) | author=Baker D| work=Rosetta@home forums | publisher=University of Washington | accessmonthday=September 16 |accessyear=2008| url=http://boinc.bakerlab.org/rosetta/forum_thread.php?id=1177&nowrap=true#52963}}</ref>  As of September 25, 2008, Foldit has over 59,000 registered users.<ref>{{cite web | title=Foldit forums: How many users does Foldit have? Etc. (message 2) | publisher=University of Washington | accessmonthday=September 27 |accessyear=2008| url=http://fold.it/portal/node/444975}}</ref>  The game gives users a set of controls (e.g. "shake", "wiggle", "rebuild") to manipulate the [[Protein#Biochemistry | backbone]] and amino acid [[side chain]]s of the target protein into more energetically favorable conformations.  Users can work on solutions individually as "soloists" or collectively as "evolvers", accruing points under either category as they improve their structure predictions.<ref>{{cite web | title=Foldit: Frequently Asked Questions | accessmonthday=September 19 |accessyear=2008| work=fold.it | publisher=University of Washington | url=http://fold.it/portal/info/faq}}</ref>  Users can also individually compete with other users through a "duel" feature, in which the player with the lowest energy structure after 20 moves wins.

==Comparison to similar distributed computing projects==
There are several distributed computed projects which have study areas similar to those of Rosetta@home, but differ in their research approach:

===Folding@home===
Of all the major distributed computing projects involved in protein research, [[Folding@home]] is the only one to not use the [[BOINC]] platform.<ref>{{cite web | title=Project list - BOINC | publisher=University of California | accessmonthday=September 8 |accessyear=2008| url=http://boinc.berkeley.edu/wiki/Project_list}}</ref>  Both Rosetta@home and Folding@home research protein misfolding diseases (e.g. Alzheimer's disease), but Folding@home does so much more exclusively.<ref>{{cite web | title=Folding@home - FAQ-Diseases | year=2007 | publisher=Stanford University | accessmonthday=September 8 |accessyear=2008| url=http://folding.stanford.edu/English/FAQ-Diseases}}</ref>  Instead of using structure- or design-based methods to predict [[amyloid]] behavior, for example, Folding@home uses [[molecular dynamics]] to model how proteins fold (or potentially misfold, and subsequently aggregate).<ref>{{cite web | title=Folding@home - About | year=2008 | publisher=Stanford University | accessmonthday=September 8 |accessyear=2008| url=http://folding.stanford.edu/Japanese/About}}</ref>  In other words, Folding@home's strength is modeling the process of protein folding, while Rosetta@home's strength is computational protein design and prediction of protein structure and docking.  The two projects also differ significantly in their computing power and host diversity.  Averaging about 3.3&nbsp;[[petaFLOPS]] (3300&nbsp;teraFLOPS) with a host base that includes the [[Playstation 3]] and [[graphics processing unit]]s,<ref>{{cite web | title=Client statistics by OS | publisher=Stanford University | accessmonthday=September 7 |accessyear=2008 | url=http://fah-web.stanford.edu/cgi-bin/main.py?qtype=osstats}}</ref> Folding@home has more than a 48-fold advantage in computing power over Rosetta@home, which averages 68&nbsp;teraFLOPS with a host base consisting only of PC-based [[CPU]]s.<ref name="BOINCstats_RosettaOverview"/>

===World Community Grid===
Both Phase I and Phase II of the [[Human Proteome Folding Project]] (HPF), a subproject of [[World Community Grid]], have used the Rosetta program to make structural and functional annotations of various [[genomes]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Malmstr<U+00F6>m L, Riffle M, Strauss CE, ''et al'' |title=Superfamily assignments for the yeast proteome through integration of structure prediction with the gene ontology |journal=PLoS biology |volume=5 |issue=4 |pages=e76 |year=2007 |month=April |pmid=17373854 |pmc=1828141 |doi=10.1371/journal.pbio.0050076 |url=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | title=World Community Grid Message Board Posts: HPF -> HPF2 transition | author=Bonneau R| date=2006 | publisher=Bonneau Lab, New York University | accessmonthday=September 7 |accessyear=2008| url=http://homepages.nyu.edu/~rb133/wcg/thread_7398.html}}</ref>  Although he now uses it to create databases for biologists, Richard Bonneau, head scientist of the Human Proteome Folding Project, was active in the original development of Rosetta at David Baker's laboratory while obtaining his PhD.<ref>{{cite web | title=List of Richard Bonneau's publications | publisher=Bonneau Lab, New York University | accessmonthday=September 7 |accessyear=2008| url=http://homepages.nyu.edu/~rb133/papers.html}}</ref>  More information on the relationship between the HPF1, HPF2 and Rosetta@home can be found on Richard Bonneau's website.<ref>{{cite web | title=World Community Grid Message Board Posts  | author=Bonneau R| publisher=Bonneau Lab, New York University | accessmonthday=September 7 |accessyear=2008| url=http://homepages.nyu.edu/~rb133/wcg/rbonneau_posts.html}}</ref>

===Predictor@home===
Like Rosetta@home, [[Predictor@home]] specializes in protein structure prediction.  Predictor@home also plans to develop new areas for its distributed computing platform in protein design and docking (using the [[CHARMM]] package for molecular dynamics),<ref>{{cite web | title=Predictor@home: Developing new application areas for P@H | publisher=The Brooks Research Group | accessmonthday=September 7 |accessyear=2008| url=http://predictor.chem.lsa.umich.edu/scientific_update_cp.php#dpath}}</ref> further likening it to Rosetta@home.  While Rosetta@home uses the Rosetta program for its structure prediction, Predictor@home uses the dTASSER methodology.<ref>{{cite web | title=dTASSER | author=Carrillo-Tripp M| publisher=The Scripps Research Institute | year=2007 | accessmonthday=September 7 |accessyear=2008| url=http://www.scripps.edu/~trippm/dtasser/}}</ref>

Other protein related distributed computing projects on [[BOINC]] include [[QMC@home]], [[Docking@home]], [[POEM@home]], [[SIMAP]], and [[TANPAKU]].  RALPH@home, the Rosetta@home [[Software_release_life_cycle#Alpha | alpha]] project which tests new application versions, work units, and updates before they move on to Rosetta@home, runs on BOINC as well.<ref>{{cite web | title=RALPH@home website | work=RALPH@home forums | publisher=University of Washington | accessmonthday=September 7 |accessyear=2008| url=http://ralph.bakerlab.org/}}</ref>

== Volunteer contributions ==
Rosetta@home depends on computing power donated by individual project members for its research.  As of September 7, 2008, over 47,000 users from 159 countries were active members of Rosetta@home, together contributing idle processor time from over 86,000 computers for a combined average performance of over 68 [[gigaFLOPS]].<ref name="BOINCstats_RosettaOverview"/>
