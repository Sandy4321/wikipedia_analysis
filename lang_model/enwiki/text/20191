{{nihongo|'''''Kingdom Hearts'''''|<U+30AD><U+30F3><U+30B0><U+30C0><U+30E0><U+30CF><U+30FC><U+30C4>|Kingudamu H<U+0101>tsu}} is an [[action role-playing game]] developed and published by [[Square Co.|Square]] (now [[Square Enix]]) in [[2002 in video gaming|2002]] for the [[Sony Computer Entertainment|Sony]] [[PlayStation 2]] [[video game console]].<ref name="KH-PSUnderground">{{cite web| url = http://www.us.playstation.com/PS2/Games/Kingdom_Hearts| publisher = PlayStation Underground| title =  PlayStation 2 - Kingdom Hearts| accessdate=2007-05-15}}</ref> It is the result of a collaboration between Square and [[The Walt Disney Company]]. The game combines characters and settings from Disney's [[animation|animated]] [[List of Disney theatrical animated features|features]] with those from the ''[[Final Fantasy (series)|Final Fantasy]]'' video game series, developed by Square. The story follows [[Sora (Kingdom Hearts)|Sora]], a young boy, as he is thrown into an epic battle against the darkness. He is joined by [[Donald Duck]] and [[Goofy]], classic Disney characters, who help him on his quest.

''Kingdom Hearts'' was a departure from Square's standard role-playing games by introducing a substantial [[action-adventure game|action-adventure]] element. In addition, it had an [[all-star]] voice cast which included many of the Disney characters' original voice actors.<ref name="voicecast">{{cite web| author = IGN Staff | url = http://ps2.ign.com/articles/359/359415p1.html | publisher = [[IGN]] | title = Kingdom Hearts Voice Cast | accessdate=2007-05-21 | date=2002-05-14}}</ref> ''Kingdom Hearts'' was also longtime Square character designer [[Tetsuya Nomura]]'s first time in a directorial position.<ref name="debut">{{cite web | author = Dengeki PlayStation staff | url = http://www.kingdomhearts3.net/small-new-nomura-interview/ | publisher = [[Dengeki PlayStation]] | title = Small New Nomura Interview | accessdate=2007-05-21 | date=2007-04-27}}</ref>

''Kingdom Hearts'' garnered praise for its unusual combination of action and role-playing, as well as its unexpectedly harmonious mix of Square and Disney.<ref name="BWGS">{{cite web| url = http://www.gamespot.com/gamespot/features/all/bestof2002/general13.html| publisher = [[GameSpot]]| title = GameSpot's Best and Worst of 2002| accessdate=2007-05-13 | date=2002}}</ref> It received numerous year-end "Best" video game awards and was a dominating presence in the 2002 holiday season and went on to achieve [[List of Sony Greatest Hits games|Sony "Greatest Hits"]] status.<ref name="greatesthits">{{cite web| author = GamePro Staff| url = http://www.gamepro.com/news.cfm?article_id=27584| publisher = [[GamePro]]| title = Kingdom Hearts sold how many?!| accessdate=2007-05-15 | date=2003-04-30}}</ref> Since its release, ''Kingdom Hearts'' has sold over 5.6 million copies worldwide.<ref name="10mil">{{cite web| author = [[SquareSoft]]| url = http://www.gamespot.com/ps2/adventure/kingdomhearts/news.html?sid=6165399| publisher = [[GameSpot]]| title = Kingdom Hearts Series Ships over 10 Million Worldwide| accessdate=2007-05-13 | date=2007-02-05}}</ref>

==Gameplay==
[[Image:Kingdom Hearts Battle Screenshot.jpg|thumb|left|A battle in the [[Monstro]] world.]]
''Kingdom Hearts'' is influenced by its parent franchise, ''[[Final Fantasy (series)|Final Fantasy]]'', and carries gameplay elements over into its own action-based, [[Hack and slash|hack-and-slash]] system. The main battle party consists of three characters: [[Sora (Kingdom Hearts)|Sora]], [[Donald Duck]], and [[Goofy]].<ref name="K-H.com">{{cite web| url = http://www.kingdom-hearts.com/uk/index.html| publisher = [[SquareSoft]]| title = Official International Kingdom Hearts Website| accessdate = 2007-05-14}}</ref> Sora, the [[protagonist|main character]], is directly controlled by the player from a [[Grammatical person#Use of grammatical person in creative media|third person]] camera angle.<ref name="KH-MobyGames">{{cite web| url = http://www.mobygames.com/game/kingdom-hearts/| publisher = [[MobyGames]]| title = Kingdom Hearts for PlayStation2| accessdate=2007-05-18}}</ref> All other party members are computer-controlled,<ref name="KHgamespy">{{cite web| url = http://ps2.gamespy.com/playstation-2/kingdom-hearts/540394p1.html| title = Kingdom Hearts Review (PS2)| author=Turner, Benjamin | date=September 3, 2002 | publisher = [[GameSpy]]| accessdate=2007-07-05}}</ref> though the player can assign the other characters specific attacks to use or spells to cast automatically in certain situations.<ref name="KHgamespot">{{cite web| url = http://www.gamespot.com/ps2/adventure/kingdomhearts/review.html| publisher = [[GameSpot]]| title = Kingdom Hearts for PlayStation 2 Review | author=Kasavin, Greg | date=September 9, 2002 | accessdate=2007-05-13}}</ref> Donald and Goofy are the only computer-controlled characters that are usable in every world (except for Destiny Islands); almost every world in the game features its own party member who can be chosen to replace Goofy or Donald in the party while the party is in that world. For instance, [[Jack Skellington]] can join the player's party in Halloween Town, but can not accompany the player elsewhere. 

Like many traditional role-playing games, ''Kingdom Hearts'' features an [[experience point]] system which determines character development. As enemies are defeated, the player gains experience which can lead up to a "level up", where the characters grow stronger and gain access to new [[Statistic (role-playing games)#Skill|abilities]].<ref name="Instructions"/> Unlike other games of its type, ''Kingdom Hearts'' allows a certain degree of character development customization through a short tutorial found at the beginning of the game. The tutorial makes the player select from one of three main attributes<U+2015>strength, defense, and magic<U+2015>for Sora to excel in and one for him to lack in.<ref name="KH-StrategyGuide">{{cite book| last= Birlew| first= Dan| year = 2003| title = Kingdom Hearts Official Strategy Guide| publisher = [[BradyGames]] Publishing| language = English| isbn= 0-7440-0198-6}}</ref> By choosing certain options, the player is able to manipulate how Sora learns abilities, [[Statistic (role-playing games)#Attributes|grows statistically]], and even gains levels.<ref name="KH-StrategyGuide"/> Donald, Goofy, and any other additional party members are assigned specific areas of strength from the outset. Donald excels in magic and Goofy excels in defense and special attacks.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.gamespot.com/ps2/adventure/kingdomhearts/news.html?sid=2859681| title = Kingdom Hearts Preview | author = Varanini, Giancarlo |publisher = [[GameSpot]]| accessdate=2007-05-18| date = 2002-04-03}}</ref> Each party member's statistics can also be altered by using special advantageous items or equipping weapons or accessories with stat-boosting effects.

The game is driven in a primarily linear progression to the next story event, usually told in the form of a [[cut scene]], though there are numerous [[Quest (gaming)#Side-quest|side quests]] available that provide bonus benefits to the characters.<ref name="KHgamespot"/> Most of the gameplay occurs on interconnected field maps where battles take place. Combat in ''Kingdom Hearts'' is in real time<ref name="GS-CompanyLine">{{cite web | url = http://www.gamespot.com/ps2/adventure/kingdomhearts/news.html?sid=2761861| author = Gerstmann, Jeff | date=May 17, 2001| publisher = [[GameSpot]]| title = E3 2001: Square announces Disney RPG for PS2| accessdate=2007-05-13}}</ref> and involves pressing buttons to initiate attacks by the on-screen character. A role-playing game menu found at the bottom left of the screen provides other combat options such as using magic and items. There is also a context-sensitive option at the bottom of the menu, usually used for interaction with the environment or for performing special attacks. This menu is manipulated by using the right analog stick or digital pad, while movement is controlled by the left analog stick, allowing the player to navigate the menu while avoiding or approaching enemies.<ref name="Instructions"/>

===Gummi Ship===
The Gummi Ship is the mode of travel between the various worlds in ''Kingdom Hearts''. The gameplay is very different from the rest of the game as it switches to a [[rail shooter]] format while piloting the Gummi Ship. The player controls the vessel from a rear, third person perspective as it travels in an outer space setting. At the beginning of the game, there are few options available to customize the ship, but as the game progresses, new weapons, engines, and armor become available. In addition, many different pre-designed blueprints can be found throughout the game which can be used to quickly construct ships.<ref name="KH-StrategyGuide"/>

===Setting===
{{main|Universe of Kingdom Hearts}}
The world of ''Kingdom Hearts'' is a collection of various [[Level (computer and video games)|levels]] that the player progresses through. Each level in Kingdom Hearts is referred to as a "world". Thirteen can be accessed throughout the game and one, the Disney Castle, is shown in [[cutscenes]]. Additional worlds are mentioned by various characters, but are not accessible because the world was destroyed by the [[Heartless]]. Ten of the worlds are based on Disney fiction,<ref name="GP-KH">{{cite web| author = FENNECFOX| url = http://www.gamepro.com/sony/ps2/games/reviews/26235.shtml| publisher = [[GamePro]]| title = Review: Kingdom Hearts for PS2 on GamePro.com| date = 2002-09-30| accessdate=2007-07-05}}</ref> primarily from the [[List of Disney animated features|Disney animated features canon]], and the other four were created by Square specifically for the game. 

Each world varies differently in appearance and setting, depending on the Disney world upon which it is based. The graphics of the world and characters were meant to resemble the artwork style of the environments and characters from their respective Disney film. Each Disney world is inhabited by characters from their respective Disney film; [[Hercules (Disney character)|Hercules]] and [[Philoctetes]] inhabit Olympus Coliseum, and [[Aladdin (Disney character)|Aladdin]], [[Princess Jasmine]], and [[Jafar (Aladdin)|Jafar]] inhabit Agrabah. Each world is disconnected from the others and exists separately. Most characters in the worlds are unaware of the existence of the other worlds, but some notable ones are aware. Players travel from one world to another via a Gummi Ship.<ref name="Instructions"/>

The worlds created specifically for the game mirror the overall appearance of the other worlds and feature either new characters or characters from several ''Final Fantasy'' games. The new worlds include: Destiny Islands, which is where the story initially begins;<ref name="IGN-KH">{{cite web| url = http://ps2.ign.com/objects/016/016467.html| publisher = [[IGN]]| title = IGN: Kingdom Hearts| accessdate=2007-05-12}}</ref> Traverse Town, which serves as a launching point into most of the gameplay; Hollow Bastion, where many of the ''Final Fantasy'' characters resided prior to the start of the game; and End of the World, a large, dark world created from the assimilation of various worlds consumed in darkness.<ref name="Goofy-EndOfWorld">'''Goofy:''' Gawrsh, is that all that's left of the worlds taken by the Heartless? {{cite video game| title = Kingdom Hearts| developer = Square Co., Limited| publisher = Square Co., Limited| date= |platform= PlayStation 2| language = English}}</ref>

The main characters travel from world to world to seal the "Keyholes"; this protects them from the Heartless and ultimately from destruction. They also try to minimize their interaction with characters of other worlds in order to maintain a balance of separation. To blend in with the inhabitants of a world, Sora, Donald, and Goofy sometimes change their physical appearance.<ref>'''Goofy:''' This sure is a spooky place. I<U+2019>ll bet the people here are scary-lookin<U+2019> too. / '''Donald:''' Don<U+2019>t worry. We look spooky, too. If they scare us, we<U+2019>ll scare them right back! {{cite video game| title = Kingdom Hearts| developer = Square| publisher = Square Electronic Arts| date= |platform= PlayStation 2| language = English}}</ref>

===Characters===
{{see|Characters of Kingdom Hearts}}
Because ''Kingdom Hearts'' was a collaboration between Disney and Square, it features a mixture of familiar Disney and Square characters, as well as several new characters designed and created by [[Tetsuya Nomura]].<ref name="GS-CompanyLine"/> The primary protagonist of the game is [[Sora (Kingdom Hearts)|Sora]], who is chosen to wield the Keyblade, a weapon for battling darkness. The game also features two of his friends, [[Kairi (Kingdom Hearts)|Kairi]] and [[Riku (Kingdom Hearts)|Riku]]. For most of the game, Sora is joined by [[Donald Duck]] and [[Goofy]]. Donald, the court wizard, and Goofy, captain of the royal guards,<ref name="KH-OfficialWebsiteInfo">{{cite web| url = http://na.square-enix.com/games/kingdomhearts/index1.html| publisher = [[Square Enix]]| title = Official Kingdom Hearts Website: Characters| accessdate=2007-05-21}}</ref> were sent from Disney Castle to find the Keyblade.<ref name="MickeyNote">'''King Mickey's Note:''' Donald, Sorry to rush off without sayin<U+2019> goodbye, but there<U+2019>s big trouble brewin<U+2019>. Not sure why, but the stars have been blinkin<U+2019> out, one by one. And that means disaster can<U+2019>t be far behind. I hate to leave you all but I<U+2019>ve gotta go check into it. There<U+2019>s someone with a <U+201C>key<U+201D><U+2014>the key to our survival. So I need you and Goofy to find him, and stick with him. Got it? We need that key or we<U+2019>re doomed! So go to Traverse Town and find Leon. He<U+2019>ll point you in the right direction. P.S. Would ya apologize to Minnie for me? Thanks, pal. {{cite video game| title = Kingdom Hearts| developer = Square | publisher = Square Electronic Arts | date= |platform= PlayStation 2| language = English}}</ref> The three join forces to search for King [[Mickey Mouse]], Kairi, and Riku. The primary antagonist is [[Xehanort|Ansem]], who is seeking to find power and knowledge by using dark beings called the [[Heartless]]. The Heartless, hearts corrupted by darkness, serve as most of the battles in the game and come in a variety of shapes and sizes. 

====Disney and Final Fantasy cameos====
As a game meant to explore the fictional universes of various Disney films, there are over 100 Disney characters.<ref name="Square-KHsite">{{Cite web| publisher = [[Square Enix]]| url = http://na.square-enix.com/games/kingdomhearts/KH_newsframe.html| title = Official Kingdom Hearts Website: News| accessdate=2007-05-14}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.gamestop.com/product.asp?product%5Fid=280415| title = Kingdom Hearts - PS2| publisher = [[GameStop]]| accessdate=2007-06-15}}</ref> While many serve as major characters in the story, others appear in cameo roles, such as the ''[[One Hundred and One Dalmatians]]'' puppies playing part in a side-quest to collect all ninety-nine. Most worlds also feature a Disney villain that the player must defeat. The player can summon various Disney characters to fight alongside Sora in battle, causing Donald and Goofy to withdraw from the battlefield for the duration of the summon. Available summoned characters include the [[Genie (Aladdin)|Genie]] from ''[[Aladdin (film)|Aladdin]]'', [[Tinkerbell]] from ''[[Peter Pan (1953 movie)|Peter Pan]]'', [[Dumbo]], and [[Simba]] from ''[[The Lion King]]''.<ref name="KH-StrategyGuide"/>

Square also incorporated several of its famous characters from the ''Final Fantasy'' series into the game, though the characters have been tweaked slightly for novelty and to fit the game's back-story. On Destiny Islands, the player meets younger versions of [[Tidus]], [[Wakka]] (both from ''Final Fantasy X''), and [[Characters of Final Fantasy VIII#Selphie Tilmitt|Selphie]] (from ''Final Fantasy VIII''). In Traverse Town, the player encounters [[Squall Leonhart]] (known in this game as "Leon") from ''Final Fantasy VIII'' as well as [[Aerith Gainsborough]], [[Cid Highwind]], and [[Yuffie Kisaragi]] from ''Final Fantasy VII''.<ref name="KH-StrategyGuide"/> [[Rikku]] from ''Final Fantasy X'' and [[Irvine Kinneas]] from ''Final Fantasy VIII'' were both originally set to make cameo appearances, but were replaced by Yuffie and Wakka respectively.<ref>{{cite web| author = [[Square Co.]]| url = http://kh2.co.uk/?kh=Artwork| publisher = [http://kh2.co.uk Kingdom Hearts Ultimania.com]|title = Early Kingdom Hearts Concept Art| accessdate=2007-05-24}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0322968/trivia| publisher = [[IMDB]]| title = Trivia for Kingdom Hearts |accessdate=2007-05-24}}</ref>  [[Cloud Strife]] and [[Sephiroth (Final Fantasy VII)|Sephiroth]] (both from ''Final Fantasy VII'') make appearances in Olympus Coliseum, where the player can fight them in the tournaments.<ref name="KH-StrategyGuide"/> The emphasis on characters from later ''Final Fantasy'' installments stems from Tetsuya Nomura's hesitation to use characters he did not design.<ref>{{cite web| author = Boulette, Bryan | url = http://www.rpgamer.com/news/Q4-2005/112705b.html| publisher = RPGamer| title = Nomura Divulges Kingdom Hearts II Details| date = 2005-11-27 | accessdate=2007-05-21}}</ref>

The game also uses other ''Final Fantasy'' icons. [[Moogle]]s make an appearance and provide item synthesis.<ref name="Instructions"/> Several weapons, such as ''Lionheart'' and ''Save the Queen'', share names with other weapons from previous entries in the ''Final Fantasy'' series. The name of the raft Riku had suggested was Highwind, a reference to the airship of ''Final Fantasy VII''. The magic-naming system in ''Kingdom Hearts'' (i.e. Cure, Cura, Curaga, etc.) is reminiscent of ''Final Fantasy'' magic. The names of various spells are also the names of Gummi blocks, and various summons, weapons, bosses, and monsters are the names of Gummi ships blueprints.

===Story===
''Kingdom Hearts'' begins on Destiny Islands, where Sora, Riku and Kairi live. The three friends seek to leave the islands to explore new worlds and have prepared a raft for this purpose.<ref name="Instructions"/> One night, the islands are attacked by darkness and shadow creatures.<ref name="KHgamespy"/> Sora seeks out his friends, finding Riku. Riku disappears, and Sora somehow obtains a key-shaped weapon, known as the Keyblade. Despite Sora's efforts at battling the shadow creatures, the islands are destroyed, and Sora is left adrift. Meanwhile, King [[Mickey Mouse]] has left his world to deal with the increasing power of darkness and left instructions for mage [[Donald Duck]] and knight [[Goofy]] to find the "key".<ref name="MickeyNote"/>

Donald and Goofy use a Gummi Ship to travel to a different world, Traverse Town, to where Sora has drifted. Sora encounters the shadow creatures again, and meets Leon, who explains the shadow creatures are [[Heartless]], creatures that consume hearts, and that the Keyblade is the only weapon capable of defeating them.<ref>'''Sora:''' The Heartless? / '''Yuffie:''' The ones who attacked you, you remember? / '''Leon:''' Those without hearts. The darkness in people<U+2019>s hearts<U+2014>that<U+2019>s what attracts them. And there is darkness within every heart. / ... / '''Leon:''' The Heartless have great fear of the Keyblade. That<U+2019>s why they<U+2019>ll keep coming after you no matter what. {{cite video game| title = Kingdom Hearts| developer = Square Co., Limited| publisher = Square Co., Limited| date= |platform= PlayStation 2| language = English}}</ref> A man named [[Ansem]], the leader of Leon's home world, is said to have studied the Heartless. Sora meets Donald and Goofy and the three decide to travel together: Donald and Goofy to find Mickey, and Sora to find Kairi and Riku. The three travel to various worlds based on Disney films, finding that the Keyblade also locks "Keyholes", passages that the Heartless use to take the heart of the world.

A group of Disney villains, led by [[Maleficent]], seek out the seven Princesses of Heart to unlock the Keyhole that leads to Kingdom Hearts<ref name="KH-MobyGames"/>, a repository of knowledge and power and the source of hearts. This group includes Riku, who Maleficent promises will help find Kairi. Maleficent sows distrust in Riku, telling him that Sora has abandoned him and Kairi for new friends and the Keyblade.<ref>'''Maleficent:''' You see? It<U+2019>s just as I told you. While you toiled away trying to find your dear friend, he quite simply replaced you with some new companions. Evidently, now he values them for more than he does you. You<U+2019>re better off without that wretched boy. Now, think no more of him, and come with me. I<U+2019>ll help you find what you<U+2019>re searching for... {{cite video game| title = Kingdom Hearts| developer = Square | publisher = Square Electronic Arts| date= |platform= PlayStation 2| language = English}}</ref> An increasingly antagonistic Riku finds Kairi's body, but cannot find her heart.

Sora and his friends eventually arrive at Hollow Bastion, the home world of Ansem, and the headquarters of Maleficent. Riku takes the Keyblade from Sora, claiming that he was the "delivery boy".<ref>'''Sora:''' But that<U+2019>s impossible. How did this happen? I<U+2019>m the one who fought my way here with the Keyblade! / '''Riku:''' You were just the delivery boy. Sorry, your part<U+2019>s over now. Here, go play hero with this. {{cite video game| title = Kingdom Hearts| developer = Square Co., Limited| publisher = Square Co., Limited| date= |platform= PlayStation 2| language = English}}</ref> Donald and Goofy, taking their order to follow the "key" seriously, leave with Riku. Sora challenges Riku again, stating that his heart derives strength from his friends; his friends return to him, as does the Keyblade. Shamed, Riku meets a cloaked man who implores him to give into the darkness. Sora, Donald and Goofy encounter Maleficent, defeating her and encountering a strangely-behaved Riku with a Keyblade that unlocks hearts. Sora finds Kairi's body and Riku, who reveals himself to be Ansem, possessing Riku's body.<ref>'''Sora:''' What? You... You're not Riku. / ... / '''Sora:''' Tell me. Who are you? / '''Ansem:''' It is I, Ansem, the seeker of darkness. {{cite video game| title = Kingdom Hearts| developer = Square | publisher = Square Electronic Arts | date= |platform= PlayStation 2| language = English}}</ref> Ansem explains that Kairi is a Princess of Heart and that her heart was trapped within Sora's body since Destiny Islands was destroyed. After defeating Ansem, Sora uses Ansem's Keyblade to unlock his heart, releasing both his and Kairi's heart. Kairi's heart returns to her body, in turn completing the final Keyhole, while Sora's heart becomes a Heartless. Sora is then returned to human form by Kairi's heart and resolves to follow Ansem.

Ansem is found in End of the World, the combined remnants of worlds taken by the Heartless.<ref name="Goofy-EndOfWorld"/> Ansem explains his belief that darkness is the heart's true essence, and he seeks Kingdom Hearts, as that would be the ultimate darkness. However, upon opening the door to Kingdom Hearts, it reveals its light, destroying Ansem. Beyond the door are Mickey and Riku, and they help Sora and the others close the door, as there are many Heartless beyond it. Mickey and Sora use their Keyblades to lock the door. The worlds reconstruct themselves, separating Sora and Kairi. The game ends with Sora, Donald, and Goofy resolving to find Riku and the King.<ref>'''Donald:''' Well, now what do we do? / '''Sora:''' We<U+2019>ve gotta find Riku and King Mickey. {{cite video game| title = Kingdom Hearts| developer = Square | publisher = Square Electronic Arts | date= |platform= PlayStation 2| language = English}}</ref>

===Musical score===
{{see|Music of Kingdom Hearts}}
[[Image:KingdomHeartsAlbumCover.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Cover of the Kingdom Hearts soundtrack.]]
The music is composed by [[Yoko Shimomura]].<ref name="KH-OST">[[Kingdom Hearts Original Soundtrack]] CD insert. Toshiba-Emi Limited. 2002.</ref> While there are some melodies derived from prior Disney films, most of the soundtrack consists of original themes written specifically for the game by Shimomura. The opening orchestration and ending credits theme were arranged and orchestrated by [[Kaoru Wada]] and performed by the [[New Japan Philharmonic Orchestra]].<ref name="KH-OST"/> The main vocal theme for the original Japanese release was titled {{nihongo|"[[Hikari (song)|Hikari]]"|<U+5149>}}. The English version of "Hikari", "[[Simple and Clean]]", was used in the Western releases and the Japanese re-release, ''Final Mix''. Both versions of the song were composed and performed by [[Utada Hikaru]].

===Voice cast===
Kingdom Hearts featured well-known voice actors for both the Japanese and English versions. The Japanese version featured [[Miyu Irino]] as Sora, [[Risa Uchida]] as Kairi, and [[Mamoru Miyano]] as Riku. Other notable voice actors included [[K<U+014D>ichi Yamadera]], [[Hideo Ishikawa]], [[Takashi Aoyagi]], [[Yutaka Shimaka]], [[Yuko Mizutani]], [[Maaya Sakamoto]] and [[Shinichir<U+014D> Miki]].<ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0322968/fullcredits#cast| title = Full cast and crew for Kingdom Hearts (2002) (VG)| publisher = [[Internet Movie Database|IMDB]]| accessdate=2007-07-05}}</ref> A special effort was made to preserve the original voice actors from the Disney movies used in ''Kingdom Hearts''. Some of the voice actors from the related television series or direct-to-video sequels were chosen over original voice actors, where applicable (e.g. [[Dan Castellaneta]] as Genie, rather than [[Robin Williams]]). The English version featured [[Haley Joel Osment]] as Sora, [[David Gallagher]] as Riku, and [[Hayden Panettiere]] as Kairi.<ref name="GP-VoiceCast">{{cite web| author = GamePro Staff| url = http://www.gamepro.com/news.cfm?article_id=23475| publisher = [[GamePro]]| title = Kingdom Hearts Voice Talent Announced| date = 2003-04-30 | accessdate=2007-05-15}}</ref><ref name="ffnet">{{cite web | author=Sains, Alex | title=Kingdom Hearts  voice actors | url=http://www.ffnet.org/square-enix/kingdom-hearts/ | work=[http://www.ffnet.org/ Final Fantasy Net] | accessdate=2006-12-23}}</ref> Other notable voice actors included [[Sean Astin]], [[Lance Bass]], [[David Boreanaz]], [[Mandy Moore]], and [[Christy Romano]].<ref name="GP-VoiceCast"/>

==Development==
The idea for ''Kingdom Hearts'' came about when producer Shinji Hashimoto met with a Disney executive in an elevator; Square and Disney had previously worked in the same building in Japan.<ref name="IGN-TGS04-NI">{{cite web| publisher = [[IGN]]| title = TGS 2004: Tetsuya Nomura Q&A| url = http://ps2.ign.com/articles/550/550462p1.html| author = Gantayat, Anoop | date = 2004-09-23| accessdate=2007-06-12}}</ref> The game began development in February 2000<ref>{{cite web| url = http://ffx.sakura.ne.jp/kh.htm| title = KINGDOM HEARTS <U+30AD><U+30F3><U+30B0><U+30C0><U+30E0><U+3000><U+30CF><U+30FC><U+30C4>| publisher = Final Fantasy 2000| language = Japanese| accessdate=2007-05-30}}</ref> and was announced at E3 in May of 2001.<ref name="GS-CompanyLine"/> Initial details were that it would be a collaboration between Square and Disney Interactive and would feature worlds developed by both companies and Disney characters. New characters were designed by Tetsuya Nomura and include Sora, Riku, Kairi, and the Heartless. The production team was comprised of over 100 members from both Square and Disney.<ref name="GS-CompanyLine"/><ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.gamespot.com/ps2/adventure/kingdomhearts/news.html?sid=6089696| publisher = [[GameSpot]]| title = Kingdom Hearts Company Line| accessdate=2007-05-13}}</ref> A playable demo featuring Riku was made available at the [[Tokyo Game Show]] in the autumn of 2001.

To help market the English release of the game, Square launched the official website in April 2002, which featured trailers, a "Name-In-Game" sweepstakes, and other Internet content.<ref>{{cite web| author = IGN Staff| url = http://ps2.ign.com/articles/356/356526p1.html| publisher = [[IGN]]| title = Square Opens Kingdom Hearts Page| date = 2002-05-14 | accessdate=2007-05-13}}</ref> On [[May 14]], [[2002]], a press release announced a list of the English voice actors. The listed included Haley Joel Osment, David Gallagher, and Hayden Panettiere as the three new characters introduced in the game. It was also announced that many of the Disney characters would be voiced by their original voice actors from their respective Disney films.<ref name="GS-CompanyLine"/><ref>{{cite web| url = http://ps2.ign.com/articles/359/359415p1.html| author = IGN Staff| publisher = [[IGN]]| title = IGN: Kingdom Hearts Voice Cast| accessdate=2007-05-13}}</ref> Additional content was added to the North American release that was not included in the initial Japanese release.<ref name="Square-KHsite"/> The new content included new optional bosses, one of which was named after the winner of the official website's "Name-In-Game" sweepstakes,<ref name="Square-KHsite"/> an additional difficulty level,<ref>{{cite web| author = GamePro Staff| date = 2003-04-30| publisher = [[GamePro]]| url = http://www.gamepro.com/news.cfm?article_id=25541| title = Square Confirms Kingdom Hearts Date| accessdate=2007-05-15}}</ref> and an unlockable teaser of ''Kingdom Hearts II''.<ref name="G4TV-NI"/> The new content was later added to the Japanese re-release titled ''Kingdom Hearts Final Mix''. ''Final Mix'' also included additional content such as new items, cut scenes, and enemies. The new content served as a [[Canon (fiction)|canonical]] update to the original release and further hinted at plotlines that would be explained in sequels.

''Kingdom Hearts'' received overall positive reviews and met with positive sales figures. During the first two months of its North American release it was one of the top 3 selling video games<ref>{{cite web| author = Calvert, Justin | url = http://www.gamespot.com/ps2/adventure/kingdomhearts/news.html?sid=2897836| publisher = [[GameSpot]]| title = October video game sales |date=2002-11-18 |accessdate=2007-07-05}}</ref> and was one of the top selling titles during the 2002 holiday season. At the end of April 2003, Square announced that ''Kingdom Hearts'' had sold its millionth copy in the United States, which made it eligible for PlayStation's "Greatest Hits" status, and over 3 million worldwide.<ref name="greatesthits"/> Sales reached 1.2 million in Japan in the first quarter of 2004, and broke 4 million worldwide.<ref>{{cite web| author = GameSpot Staff| url = http://www.gamespot.com/ps2/adventure/kingdomhearts/news.html?sid=6091627| publisher = [[GameSpot]]| title = Kingdom Hearts tips scales at 4 million| date = 2004-03-17 | accessdate=2007-05-18}}</ref> In December 2005, the [[NPD Group]] listed it as "one of the top ten best-selling PlayStation 2 titles of all time in North America".<ref>{{cite web| title = Kingdom Hearts II Gets All-Star Cast| url = http://games.ign.com/articles/686/686944p1.html| author = Coleman, Stephen | publisher = [[IGN]]| date = 2006-02-08| accessdate=2007-06-14}}</ref> As of December 2006, ''Kingdom Hearts'' had shipped over 5.6 million copies worldwide with 1.1 million in [[PAL region]]s, 1.5 million in Japan, and 3 million in North America.<ref name="10mil"/>

===Critical response===
The game received high ratings among reviews. In 2007, [[IGN]] listed ''Kingdom Hearts'' as the 22<sup>nd</sup> best PlayStation 2 game of all time.<ref name="22nd">{{cite web| author = IGN PlayStation Team| date=2007-03-16| url=http://ps2.ign.com/articles/772/772296p1.html| title = The Top 25 PS2 Games of All Time| publisher = [[IGN]]| accessdate=2007-03-18}}</ref> Critics commended the visuals, orchestral score, voice acting, and action-adventure role-playing game feel to the game. IGN named it "Best Art Style/Direction", runner-up for "Best CG Graphics", and honorable mention for "Best Animation" in IGN's 2003 list of "Best Looking Games on PS2".<ref>{{cite web| author = Perry, Douglass C. | url = http://ps2.ign.com/articles/390/390226p1.html| publisher = [[IGN]]| title = IGN: The Best Looking Games on PS2| date = 2003-03-20 | accessdate=2007-05-13}}</ref> ''GamePro'' stated the graphics were "gorgeous" and rated them a 4.5 out of 5.<ref name="GP-KH"/> The audio was also praised, particularly the quality of the voice-overs<ref name="KHgamespy"/><ref name="KHgamespot"/> and a well received musical score. ''GamePro'' had positive comments on the overall audio and rated it a 5 out of 5.<ref name="GP-KH"/> 

Criticism about the gameplay was mixed. Many reviews complained that the camera was at times frustrating and the Gummi Ship portions were out of place. GameSpot cited "tedious" gameplay and Gummi Ship sections as "pale imitations of the [[Star Fox (series)|''Star Fox'' series]]", but stated that the combat was fun, particularly the boss fights.<ref name="KHgamespot"/> They also commented that the concept of mixing the serious elements of ''Final Fantasy'' with the lighter elements of Disney seemed impossible, but was pulled off quite well. Because of that they awarded ''Kingdom Hearts'' "Best Crossover Since Capcom vs. SNK" in their 2002 Best and Worst of the Year awards.<ref name="BWGS"/> [[MediaWorks (publisher)|Dengeki Online]] commented on the camera controls, saying that the camera would often run into objects while being rotated by the player.<ref>{{cite web| publisher = Dengeki Online| url = http://www.dengekionline.com/soft/review/rev_kingdomhearts.htm| language = Japanese| title = <U+96FB><U+6483><U+30AA><U+30F3><U+30E9><U+30A4><U+30F3><U+7DE8><U+96C6><U+90E8><U+304C><U+30AA><U+30B9><U+30B9><U+30E1><U+3059><U+308B><U+30BD><U+30D5><U+30C8><U+3092><U+500B><U+6027><U+7684><U+306A><U+30EC><U+30D3><U+30E5><U+30A2><U+30FC><U+304C><U+30A2><U+30C4><U+304F><U+8A9E><U+308B>!| accessdate = 2007-07-08}}</ref> GameSpy cited that the periodic departure from the main plot into the Disney side stories was disappointing, and when the original plot builds to a climax, "...the story fails to gel thanks to a confusing mish-mash of vague terms and symbolism that probably made more sense in the director's head than in this final product." Aside from the plot, they stated the overall package was worth playing through to the end.<ref name="KHgamespy"/> Fan response was also positive; ''Kingdom Hearts'' was voted as the 19<sup>th</sup> best game of all-time by readers of the Japanese magazine ''[[Famitsu]]'',<ref name="Famitsu">{{cite web| title=Famitsu Reveals Top 100 Reader-Voted Games Of All-Time| url = http://www.gamasutra.com/php-bin/news_index.php?story=8378| publisher = [[Gamasutra]]| date = 2006-03-03 | accessdate=2007-05-29}}</ref> 16<sup>th</sup> by the users of website [[GameFAQs]],<ref>{{cite web | author=GameFAQs Site Staff| year=2005| url = http://www.gamefaqs.com/features/contest/top10| title=Fall 2005: 10-Year Anniversary Contest - The 10 Best Games Ever| publisher = [[GameFAQs]]| accessdate=2007-07-05}}</ref> and 92<sup>nd</sup> by IGN users.<ref>{{cite web| author = IGN Site Staff | year = 2006 | title = Readers' Picks Top 100 Games: 91-100 | url = http://top100.ign.com/2006/091-100.html | publisher = [[IGN]] | accessdate=2007-05-29}}</ref>

==Versions and merchandise==
There were a multiple versions of ''Kingdom Hearts'' released. The first was the original Japanese release which was followed by the North American and PAL releases, which included additional content. The game was later re-released in Japan as ''Kingdom Hearts Final Mix'', which featured the content of the North American/PAL release, as well as new content. Both Square and Disney also released numerous types of merchandise before and after the release of the game. Merchandise ranged from toys and figurines<ref name="Square-KHsite"/> to clothing items and books. Like the ''Final Fantasy'' games, Square released an ''[[Ultimania]]'' book on ''Kingdom Hearts'' in Japan following the release of the game and a revised edition following the release of ''Final Mix''. In North America, a strategy guide was released by [[Brady Games]]. It featured a comprehensive walkthrough and a sticker activity journal.<ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.bradygames.com/title/0744001986| title = Kingdom Hearts Official Strategy Guide| publisher = [[Brady Games]]| accessdate = 2007-07-07}}</ref><ref name="KH-StrategyGuide"/> A manga series based on the game was also released in both Japan and the United States. A novel series also based on the game was released in Japan. It was authored by Tomoco Kanemaki and illustrated by Shiro Amano. The novel series consists of two volumes and is scheduled to be released in the United States in August 2007.<ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.amazon.com/Kingdom-Hearts-First-Door/dp/1423103955/| title = Kingdom Hearts: The First Door - #1 (Kingdom Hearts) (Paperback)| publisher = [[Amazon.com]]| accessdate=2007-06-27}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| publisher = [[Amazon.com]]| url = http://www.amazon.com/Kingdom-Hearts-Darkness-Within/dp/1423103963/| title = Kingdom Hearts: Darkness Within - #2 (Kingdom Hearts) (Paperback)| accessdate=2007-06-27}}</ref>

===Final Mix===
[[Image:Neo Shadow.jpg|200px|thumb|bottom|right|Neoshadows, one of the new enemies, in ''Final Mix'', along with the One-Winged Angel Keyblade.]]
''Kingdom Hearts Final Mix'' has several events and a number of gameplay tweaks that are not in previous releases. Spoken dialogue is in English,<ref name="IGN-FinalMix">{{cite web| url = http://ps2.ign.com/objects/665/665093.html| publisher = [[IGN]]| title = IGN: Kingdom Hearts Final Mix| accessdate=2007-05-13}}</ref> with Japanese subtitles. New scenes, clarifying certain plot points, such as Riku's journey and foreshadowing of ''Kingdom Hearts II'', were included. A gameplay tweak allows the player to skip cut scenes after seeing them once.<ref name="IGN-FinalMix"/> The optional bosses first included in the English version were introduced to Japanese players for the first time, along with "[[Organization XIII#I. Xemnas|Unknown]]", in an attempt to raise interest for the sequel. In another attempt at foreshadowing, a video titled "Another Side, Another Story [deep dive]" plays at the ending if the player accomplishes certain tasks.<ref name="KHInsider-FinalMix">{{cite web| url = http://www.khinsider.com/kingdom-hearts/final-mix.html| publisher = Kindgom Hearts Insider| title = Kingdom Hearts Insider - Final Mix| accessdate=2007-05-29}}</ref> New music tracks incorporated were "Disappeared" and "Another Side". The "Night on Bald Mountain" and "One-Winged Angel" tracks from the English version were included as well. Other changes include new abilities, new weapons, new items, additional and recolored enemies,<ref name="KHS-UltimaniaAlpha>{{cite book| year = 2005| title = Kingdom Hearts Series Ultimania <U+03B1> ~Introduction of Kingdom Hearts II~| publisher = [[Square Enix]]| language = Japanese| isbn= 4-7575-1597-9}}</ref> and gameplay tweaks to make the game easier for the player, along with two new difficulty levels.<ref name="KHInsider-FinalMix"/><ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.neoseeker.com/Games/Products/PS2/kingdomhearts_final/| publisher = [[Neoseeker]]| title = Kingdom Hearts: Final Mix (Import)| accessdate=2007-05-29}}</ref>

On the first day of the re-release, the game also included either a deck of Kingdom Hearts cards or a special music CD. A limited "Platinum Edition" version of ''Kingdom Hearts Final Mix'' was also released. The platinum version included an action figure of Sora, a sticker set, sketches of some of the main characters, and the game itself.<ref name="IGN-FinalMix">{{cite web| url = http://ps2.ign.com/objects/665/665093.html| publisher = [[IGN]]| title = IGN: Kingdom Hearts: Final Mix| accessdate=2007-05-13}}</ref>

===Manga===
{{see|Kingdom Hearts (manga series)}}
[[Image:KingdomHeartsMangaVol1Cover.jpg|thumb|left|118px|Cover of the first volume of the ''Kingdom Hearts'' manga.]]
The game was adapted into a [[Kingdom Hearts (manga series)|manga]] by [[Shiro Amano]]. The story follows the events that took place in the game with a few minor differences to account for the loss of interactivity a video game provides. Some events that took place in the ''Final Mix'' version were also included. The manga was originally serialized in Japan by Square's [[Monthly Shonen Gangan]], but has since been released worldwide. All four volumes have been published in English in the [[United States]] by [[Tokyopop]]. The first volume was released on October 11, 2005<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.tokyopop.com/S-1525/1.html| title = Kingdom Hearts Volume 1 Product Info| publisher = [[Tokyopop]]| accessdate=2007-05-10}}</ref> and was ranked 95<small><sup>th</sup></small> in [[USA Today|USA Today's]] "Top 150 best sellers" during the week of its release.<ref>{{cite web| url = http://asp.usatoday.com/life/books/booksdatabase/default.aspx?lastValue=90&date=10/20/2005| publisher = [[USA Today]]| title = USA Today Best-Selling Books Database - Top 150 best sellers| accessdate=2007-07-05}}</ref> The fourth volume was released on July 10, 2006<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.tokyopop.com/S-1525/4.html| title = Kingdom Hearts Volume 4 Product Info| publisher = [[Tokyopop]]| accessdate=2007-05-10}}</ref> and was followed by a boxed set containing all four volumes on October 10, 2006.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.tokyopop.com/S-1751/1.html| title = Kingdom Hearts Box Set Product Info| publisher = [[Tokyopop]]| accessdate=2007-05-10}}</ref> The series was followed by a second manga series, ''[[Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories]]''. A noteworthy feature of the manga is that even in its original, Japanese language edition, the ''Kingdom Hearts'' comic adaptation was designed to be read from left to right, contrary to the Japanese norm, although the later ''Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories'' and ''Kingdom Hearts II'' comic adaptations are read from right to left.
