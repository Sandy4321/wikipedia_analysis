===Murder Inc.===
[[Image:Ant-50 Cent billboard in Tribeca by David Shankbone.jpg|thumb|right|An anti-50 Cent billboard in [[Tribeca]], New York.]]
Before signing with Interscope, 50 Cent was engaged in a well-publicized dispute with rapper [[Ja Rule]] and his label [[The Inc. Records|Murder Inc. Records]]. The rappers engaged in numerous mixtape "[[Dissing|disses]]". 50 Cent claimed the feud began in 1999 after Ja Rule spotted him with a man who robbed him of his jewelry.<ref name=Playboy/> However, Ja Rule claimed the conflict stemmed from a video shoot in [[Queens]] because 50 Cent did not like seeing him "getting so much love" from the neighborhood.<ref>[http://www.mtv.com/bands/j/ja_rule/news_feature_031103/index.jhtml Ja Rule on 50 Cent, God and Hip-Hop].

An [[affidavit]] by an [[IRS]] agent suggested that the label had ties to [[Kenneth "Supreme" McGriff]], a New York [[drug lord]] who was suspected of being involved in the murder of [[Jam Master Jay]] and the shooting of 50 Cent. An excerpt of the affidavit read:

{{blockquote|The investigation has uncovered a conspiracy involving McGriff and others to murder a rap artist who has released songs containing lyrics regarding McGriff's criminal activities. The rap artist was shot in 2000, survived and thereafter refused to cooperate with law enforcement regarding the shooting. Messages transmitted over the Murder Inc. pager indicate that McGriff is involved in an ongoing plot to kill this rap artist, and that he communicates with Murder Inc. employees concerning the target.<ref name=TSG/>}}

===New York rappers===

===The Game===
{{main article|G-Unit vs. The Game feud}}
In early 2005, 50 Cent began a feud with [[The Game (rapper)|The Game]], whom he was close to before releasing his debut album ''[[The Documentary]]''. After its release, 50 Cent felt The Game was disloyal for saying he did not want to participate in G-Unit's feuds with other rappers and even wanting to work with artists they were feuding with. He also claimed that he wrote six songs on the album and was not receiving proper credit for his work, which The Game denied.<ref>Reid, Shaheem ([[March 1]] [[2005]]).

===Lawsuit===
On [[July 21]] [[2007]], 50 Cent filed a [[United States dollar|US$]]1 million lawsuit against advertising company Traffix Inc. of [[Pearl River, New York]] for using his image in a promotion which he says threatens his safety. He learned about the internet ad after one of his staff members saw it on a [[MySpace]] page. According to court documents, the ad features a cartoon image of the rapper and the message: "shoot the rapper and you will win $5000 or five ring tones guaranteed." Though the ad did not use his name, the image allegedly intended to resemble him, suggesting he endorsed the ad. The lawsuit calls it a "vile, tasteless and despicable" use of 50 Cent's image that "quite literally calls for violence against him". The lawsuit also seeks for unspecified [[punitive damages]] and a permanent [[injunction]] against the use of his image without permission.<ref>[http://www.cbc.ca/arts/music/story/2007/07/21/50cent-lawsuit-ad.html?ref=rss 50 Cent says ad threatens his life, files lawsuit].
