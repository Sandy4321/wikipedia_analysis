The '''Williams' bon chr<U+00E9>tien''' pear, commonly called the '''Williams pear''' or the '''Bartlett pear''' in the United States and Canada, is the most commonly grown variety of pear in most countries outside Asia.

It is a [[cultivar]] (cultivated variety) of the species ''Pyrus communis'', commonly known as the [[European Pear|European pear]]. The fruit has a bell shape, considered the traditional [[Pear shaped|pear shape]] in the west, and its green skin turns yellow upon later ripening, although red-skinned derivative varieties exist. It is considered a summer pear, not as tolerant of cold as some varieties. It is often eaten raw, but holds its shape well when baked, and is a common choice for canned or other processed pear uses.

==History==
[[Image:Hedrick (1921) - Bartlett.jpg|thumb|left|Bartlett pear, from ''The Pears of New York'' (1921) by [[Ulysses Prentiss Hedrick]]]]

The origins of this variety are uncertain. "Bon Chr<U+00E9>tien" (Good Christian) is named after Francis of Paola, a holy man whom King Louis XI of France had called to his deathbed as a healer in 1483. Francis offered the king a pear seed from his native Calabria with instructions to plant and care. Hence the pear tree was called "Good Christian". The Williams pear is thought to date from 1765 to 1770 from the yard of an [[Aldermaston]], England, schoolmaster named Mr. Stair or Mr. Wheeler, giving rise to the now-obscure synonyms Aldermaston pear and Stairs pear. A nurseryman named Williams later acquired the variety, and after introducing it to the rest of England, the pear became known as the Williams Pear.<ref name="usapears.com">USA Pears. (2008). [http://web.archive.org/web/20070714194736/http://www.usapears.com/pears/varieties_yellow_bartlett.asp]. (website). Yellow Bartlett Pears.</ref> However, the pear's full name is Williams' Bon Chretien, or "Williams' good Christian." <ref name="usapears.com" />

In 1799 James Carter imported several Williams trees into the United States, and they were planted on the grounds of Thomas Brewer in Roxbury, [[Massachusetts]].<ref name="usapears.com" />  The Massachusetts estate was later acquired by Enoch Bartlett of Dorchester, Massachusetts. Unaware of their origin, Bartlett named the pears after himself and introduced the variety into the United States. It was not realized that Bartlett and Williams Pears were the same until 1828, when new trees arrived from Europe.<ref name="usapears.com" />  By that time the Bartlett variety had become vastly popular in the United States, and they are still generally known as Bartlett pears in the U.S. and Canada, although there are about 150 other synonyms worldwide.<ref name="janick2000">Janick, Jules.

The pear exhibits a pyriform  "pear shape," with a rounded bell on the bottom half of the fruit, and then a definitive shoulder with a smaller neck or stem end.<ref name="usapears.com" /> Williams are aromatic pears, and have what many{{who|reason=the reference is an industry promotional page which does not identify the "many"|date=January 2011}} consider the definitive "pear flavor".<ref name="usapears.com" /> Colors of the pear vary from green (when unripe), to yellow (ripe) and red. Red Bartletts or Williams are very similar to the traditional Williams, aside from ripening to a reddish color rather than a yellow color. Red-skinned mutant clones (i.e. "sports") of the Williams are increasing in popularity, including three major varieties in the U.S.: the Max Red Bartlett, the Sensation Red Bartlett, and the Rosired Bartlett. One study of several macrosatellite loci in 63 European Pear (''[[Pyrus communis]]'' L.) cultivars did not distinguish Max Red Bartlett and Sensation Red Bartlett from the standard Williams, which was expected since the red mutants were derived from the Williams by mutation.<ref>W<U+00FC>nscha, A., and I.

Best when picked with the internal pressure of the pear is between {{convert|18|psi|abbr=on}} and {{convert|16|psi|abbr=on}}, the pear should still be green and relatively hard when picked. Optimum conditions for ripening are in dry shady areas, and ripening usually takes 7 to 10 days from when the pear was picked. As the pear ripens the color will slowly change to a soft yellow and the pear will soften. Commercially produced pears are normally picked and shipped to the stores while green.<ref name="delange.org">Delange.(2007). [http://www.delange.org/PearBartlett/PearBartlett.htm]. (website).

==Production and uses==

===U.S. Pear production===

In 1985, this variety represented 80% of U.S. pear production while in 2004 it represented 50% of reported pear production, displaced primarily by the continuing growth of [[d'Anjou]] and [[Bosc Pear|Bosc]] pears, both winter pears more tolerant of cold than the Bartlett.<ref name="janick2000" /><ref>U.S. Department of Agriculture. (September 2004.) [http://www.ars-grin.gov/npgs/cgc_reports/PyrusCGCReport2004.pdf "''Pyrus'' Crop Germplasm Committee: Report and genetic vulnerability statement, September 2004"]. (Website.) Germ Resources Information Network (GRIN), page 5. Retrieved on 2007-10-02.</ref>

While more pears are sold fresh in the U.S. than processed, Bartlett pears are the primary choice for canned halves, puree, and most pear juice and nectar in the U.S., comprising about two thirds of Bartlett production. Bartletts are traditionally known as the [[canning]] pear due to their "definitive flavor and sweetness," making them well-suited for many forms of processing.<ref name="usapears.com" />
