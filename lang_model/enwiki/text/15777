{{Main|Catholic sexual abuse scandals}}

The '''Catholic sexual abuse scandal in Ireland''' is a major chapter in the worldwide [[Catholic sexual abuse scandal]].  Unlike the [[Catholic sexual abuse scandal in the United States]], the scandal in Ireland included cases of high-profile Catholic clerics involved in illicit heterosexual relations as well as widespread physical abuse of children in the Catholic-run childcare network.

Starting in the 1990s, a series of criminal cases and Irish government enquiries established that hundreds of priests had abused thousands of children in previous decades. In many cases, the abusing priests were moved to other parishes to avoid embarrassment or a scandal, and senior clergy assisted in this. By 2010 a number of in-depth judicial reports had been published, but with relatively few prosecutions. 

The abuse was occasionally made known to staff at the [[Department of Education and Science (Ireland)|Department of Education]], the [[Garda Siochana|police]] and other government bodies, who have said that prosecuting clergy was extremely difficult given the "Catholic ethos" of the Irish Republic.

==Early revelations of sexual misconduct==
===Eamon Casey===
In 1992, the media exposed the fact that [[Eamon Casey]], Bishop  of Galway had fathered a son some eighteen years earlier and abandoned both mother and child for years. It was also revealed that Casey had used church funds to buy their silence.  Casey's resignation is widely regarded as a pivotal moment when the Roman Catholic [[hierarchy]] began to lose its considerable influence over the society and politics of the [[Republic of Ireland]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}  
 
===Michael Cleary===
  
in 1993, it was revealed that Father [[Michael Cleary (priest)|Michael Cleary]] had fathered two children with his longtime housekeeper. It emerged that Cleary lived with his common-law wife and son while pretending that he was merely giving employment and assistance to her.<ref>Secret Love: My Life with Father Michael Cleary'' by Phyllis Hamilton and Paul Williams (1995) Mainstream Publishing- now out of print</ref>

===Micheal Ledwith===
{{Main|Micheal Ledwith}}

In 1984, a group of seminarians in the <U+2018>senior division<U+2019> of St Patrick<U+2019>s Seminary Maynooth, expressed their concerns to the senior dean regarding the inappropriate behavior of Michael Ledwith, then vice president of the College, towards younger students.  Ledwith was promoted to President of Maynooth despite the allegations.  He subsequently resigned as President in 1994 as when allegations of sexual abuse resurfaced.

In June 2002, the bishops commissioned [[McCullough Report|Denis McCullough]] to investigate allegations reported in The Irish Times that the bishops had not responded adequately to complaints of sexual harassment of seminarians at Maynooth College in the early 1980<U+2019>s.  McCullough's report, published on 16 June 2005, found that, while the seminarians had not complained directly to the bishops directly regarding Ledwith's alleged sexual abuse, <U+201C>concerns of apparent propensities rather than accusations of actual crime or specific offences<U+201D> had been communicated to the bishops by the senior dean of the college.  McCullough concluded <U+201C>that to have rejected the senior dean<U+2019>s concerns so completely and so abruptly without any adequate investigation may have been too precipitate, although, of course, to investigate in any very full or substantial manner, a generic complaint regarding a person<U+2019>s apparent propensities would have been difficult<U+201D>.<ref>{{cite journal |journal=The Crimson Observer |url=http://crimson-observer.blogspot.com/2009/12/judge-bishops-by-what-they-do-not-by.html |title=Judge bishops by what they do, not by what they say |date=2009-12-19 |accessdate=2010-01-13}}</ref>

===Brendan Smyth===
One of the best known cases of sex abuse in [[Ireland]] involved [[Brendan Smyth (priest)|Brendan Smyth]], who, between 1945 and 1989, sexually abused and indecently assaulted  twenty children in [[parish]]es in [[Belfast]], [[Dublin]] and the [[United States]].<ref>{{cite web | author = Irish News| title = Fr Brendan Smyth  | url=http://www.irishnews.com/searchlog.asp?reason=denied_empty&script_name=/pageacc.asp&path_info=/pageacc.asp&tser1=ser&par=ben&sid=219807 | accessdate = 2009-06-10 }}</ref> The investigation of the Smyth case was allegedly [[obstruction of justice|obstructed]] by the [[Norbertine Order]].  Smyth was wanted for prosecution in Northern Ireland and took refuge in a monastery in the Republic of Ireland.  He was arrested in 1995; however, Ireland<U+2019>s Attorney General did not immediately comply with a request from the [[Royal Ulster Constabulary]] for Smyth's extradition.  The ensuing controversy over the delay led to the collapse of the [[Government of the 27th D<U+00E1>il|Fianna F<U+00E1>il/Labour coalition government]].<ref>[http://escholarship.bc.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1007&context=church21_papers]</ref>

==Abuse in the state childcare system==

From the 1930s up until the early 1990s, approximately 35,000 Irish children and teenagers who were orphans, petty thieves, truants, unmarried mothers or from dysfunctional families were sent to a network of 250 Church-run industrial schools, reformatories, orphanages and hostels.

In the 1990s, a series of television programs publicized allegations of systemic abuse in Ireland's Catholic-run childcare system, primarily in the Reformatory and Industrial Schools.  The abuse occurred primarily between the 1930s and 1970s.  These documentaries included "Dear Daughter", "Washing Away the Stain" and "Witness: Sex in a Cold Climate and Sinners".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.religioustolerance.org/clergy_sex10.htm |title=Past Catholic sexual and physical child abuse in Ireland |accessdate=2010-01-07}}</ref><ref name=SavageSmith>[http://escholarship.bc.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1007&context=church21_papers]</ref>  These programs interviewed adult victims of abuse who provided "testimony of their experiences, they documented Church and State collusion in the operation of these institutions, and they underscored the climate of secrecy and denial that permeated the church response when faced with controversial accusations."  The topic was also covered by American broadcast media.  Programs such as CBS<U+2019>s 60 Minutes and ABC<U+2019>s 20/20 produced segments on the subject for an Irish-American audience.<ref name=SavageSmith />

In 1999, a documentary film series titled "[[States of Fear]]" which detailed abuse suffered by Irish children between the 1930s and 1970s in the state childcare system, primarily in the Reformatory and Industrial Schools.

==Response of the Irish government to the scandal==
<!-- 
On May 11, 1999, speaking before the Irish parliament, Taoiseach Bertie Ahern announced a comprehensive program of response to the controversy. At the core of Ahern<U+2019>s speech was the first official apology to victims of abuse suffered while they were institutionalized as part of the nation<U+2019>s childcare system. The Taoiseach asked for forgiveness: <U+201C>On behalf of the State and of all citizens of the State, the Government wishes to make a sincere and long overdue apology to the victims of childhood abuse for our collective failure to intervene, to detect their pain, to come to their rescue.<U+201D><ref>[http://escholarship.bc.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1007&context=church21_papers]</ref> -->

In response to the furor aroused by the media reports, the Irish government commissioned a study which took nine years to complete.  On May 20, 2009, the commission released its 2600 page report, which drew on testimony from thousands of former inmates and officials from more than 250 church-run institutions.  The commission found that Catholic priests and nuns had terrorised thousands of boys and girls for decades and that government inspectors had failed to stop the chronic beatings, rape and humiliation.  The report characterized rape and sexual molestation as "endemic" in Irish Catholic church-run industrial schools and orphanages.

==Response of the Church to the scandals==

In June 2001, the hierarchy of the Catholic Church in Ireland established the [[Catholic Church Commission on Child Sexual Abuse (Ireland)]], also known as the Hussey Commission, to investigate how complaints about clerical abuse of minors have been handled over the last three decades.

In February 2002, 18 religious orders agreed to provide more than 128 million Euros (approximately $128 million) in compensation to the victims of childhood abuse. Most of the money was raised from church property transfers to the State.  The agreement stipulated that all those who accepted the monetary settlements had to waive their right to sue both the church and the government. The identities of the abusers was also to be kept secret.

==Brendan Comiskey==

In March 2002, a BBC Television documentary, titled "Suing the Pope", highlighted the case of [[Se<U+00E1>n Fortune]], one of the most notorious clerical sexual offenders. The film followed Colm O'Gorman as he investigated the story of how Fortune was allowed to abuse him and countless other teenage boys.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/correspondent/1879407.stm Suing the Pope] ''BBC News''</ref> The Church's practice of [[parish transfers of abusive priests]] allowed Fortune to be transferred to other parishes without notifying them about any former abuse allegations.

On April 1, 2002, [[Brendan Comiskey]], Bishop of [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Ferns|Ferns]], resigned over charges that he had failed to deal adequately with allegations that Fr.[[Se<U+00E1>n Fortune]] and others were [[child molestation|sexually abusing children]].<ref>[http://www.rte.ie/news/2002/0531/maynooth.html News story of Ledwith compensation in 2002]</ref>

==Desmond Connell==

In October 2002, Ireland<U+2019>s national broadcasting station aired a television documentary titled "Primetime: Cardinal Secrets" which charged Dublin<U+2019>s Cardinal Desmond Connell with gross-mishandling of the sex abuse scandal and accusing him of participating in a deliberate cover-up of facts.<ref>[http://escholarship.bc.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1007&context=church21_papers]</ref>  Connell retired as archbishop on 26 April 2004. 

The [[Murphy Report]] found that Connell had handled the affair "badly" as he was "slow to recognise the seriousness of the situation.<ref>http://edition.cnn.com/2009/WORLD/europe/11/26/ireland.religion.abuse/index.html</ref> It did praise him for making the archdiocesan records available to the authorities in 2002 and for his 1995 actions in giving the authorities the names of 17 priests who had been accused of abuse, although it said the list was incomplete as complaints were made against at least 28 priests in the Archdiocese.<ref>http://edition.cnn.com/2009/WORLD/europe/11/26/ireland.religion.abuse/index.html</ref>He was criticised<ref>[http://www.sbpost.ie/post/pages/p/wholestory.aspx-qqqt=VINCENT+BROWNE-qqqs=commentandanalysis-qqqsectionid=3-qqqc=5.1.0.0-qqqn=1-qqqx=1.asp The lies that Connell claims he never told ]</ref> for being economical with the truth in his use<ref>[http://www.justice.ie/en/JELR/Part%202.pdf/Files/Part%202.pdf Murphy Report, Page 643 ]</ref> of the concept of [[mental reservation]] to inadequately answer questions truthfully<ref>Cardinal Connell explained the concept of mental reservation to the Commission in the following way:
''Well, the general teaching about mental reservation is that you are not permitted to tell a lie. On the other hand, you may be put in a position where you have to answer, and there may be circumstances in which you can use an ambiguous expression realising that the person who you are talking to will accept an untrue version of whatever it may be - permitting that to happen, not willing that it happened, that would be lying. It really is a matter of trying to deal
with extraordinarily difficult matters that may arise in social relations where people may ask questions that you simply cannot answer. Everybody knows that this kind of thing is liable to happen. So, mental reservation is, in a sense, a way of answering without lying''.</ref> about his knowledge of the abusive activities of priests under his control.

==Ferns Report==
{{Main|Ferns Report}}

The Ferns Inquiry (2005) was an official Irish government inquiry into the allegations of clerical sexual abuse in the Irish [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Ferns]].  The investigation was established in the wake of the broadcast of the BBC Television documentary, titled "Suing the Pope".  O'Gorman, through [[One in Four]], the organization he founded to support women and men who have experienced sexual violence, successfully campaigned for the Ferns Inquiry.

The Ferns Inquiry recorded its revulsion at the extent, severity and duration of the child sexual abuse allegedly perpetrated on children by priests acting under the aegis of the Diocese of Ferns.<ref>[http://www.bishop-accountability.org/ferns/ Ferns Report 2005]</ref>

==Irish Child Abuse Commission 2009==
{{Main|Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse}}

A lengthy report detailing cases of emotional, physical and [[sexual abuse]] of thousands of children over 70 years was published on 20 May 2009.  The report drew on the testimony of nearly 2,000 witnesses, men and women who attended more than 200 Catholic-run schools from the 1930s until the 1990s.

As per 2002 agreement between the victims on one side and the Catholic brothers and Irish government on other side, all those who accepted the state/Brothers settlements, had to waive their right to sue both the church and the government. Their abusers' identities are also kept secret. 

<!--
The report states that sexual abuse was prevalent, especially in boys' facilities.  The religious authorities knew that such misconduct was a persistent problem, but children who complained were ignored or blamed for what had occurred.  The commission found that, when school authorities did deal with complaints, each case was examined in isolation and secrecy, with "no attempt to address the underlying systemic nature of the problem". Punishment for an offender often meant transfer to another institution, where, "in many instances, he was free to abuse again."

The commission also blamed secular authorities for failure to protect the children in the Catholic-run facilities. Visits by Department of Education inspectors were announced in advance. And while the department should have realized that the problem of physical violence was endemic, its staff preferred to defer to the religious authorities, the report says.

===Response of government===
Ireland's national police force announced that they would study the report to see if it provided any new evidence for prosecuting clerics for assault, rape or other criminal offenses. The report, however, did not identify any abusers by name because of a right-to-privacy lawsuit by the Christian Brothers order. 

Shamed by the extent, length, and cruelty of child abuse, Ireland's Prime Minister [[Brian Cowen]] apologized to victims for the government's failure to intervene in endemic sexual abuse and severe beatings in schools for much of the  20th century. He also promised to reform the Ireland's social services for children in line with the recommendations of the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse report <ref>[http://news.yahoo.com/s/nm/20090526/wl_nm/us_ireland_abuse Shamed by child abuse, Ireland to reform services] ''Reuters, May 26 2009''</ref>.

===Response of the bishops===
{{Main|Ecclesiastical response to Catholic sex abuse cases}}
The highest ranked official of the Roman Catholic Church in Ireland, Dublin Archbishop [[Diarmuid Martin]] slammed Irish Catholic orders for concealing their culpability in decades of child abuse, and said they needed to come up with much more money to compensate victims<ref>[http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20090525/ap_on_re_eu/eu_ireland_catholic_abuse Archbishop slams Irish Catholic orders over abuse] ''AP, May 25 2009''</ref>.

At the conclusion of its summer meeting, the Irish Catholic Bishops' Conference said that the abuse of children in institutions run by Catholic priests and nuns was part of a culture that was prevalent in the Catholic Church in Ireland.  The bishops spent a major portion of their June 8-10 meeting discussing a report from the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse, published May 20 under chairman Sean Ryan. The commission found that church institutions failed to prevent an extensive level of sexual, physical and emotional abuse and neglect. 
  
In a joint statement, the bishops said that, "the Ryan report represents the most recent disturbing indictment of a culture that was prevalent in the Catholic Church in Ireland for far too long.  Heinous crimes were perpetrated against the most innocent and vulnerable, and vile acts with life-lasting effects were carried out under the guise of the mission of Jesus Christ.  This abuse represents a serious betrayal of the trust which was placed in the church."<ref name=Spero>{{cite web |url=http://www.speroforum.com/a/19704/The-Catholic-Churchs-March-of-Misery-in-Ireland |title=The Catholic Church's March of Misery in Ireland |date=2009-06-24 |first=Shay |last=Cullen |accessdate=2009-07-27}}</ref>

Cardinal [[Sean Brady]] expressed remorse on behalf of the church and the religious saying <U+201D>we are ashamed, humbled and repentant that our people strayed so far from their Christian ideals, for this we ask forgiveness.<U+201D>  The abuses were the result of <U+201C>a culture that was prevalent in the Catholic Church in Ireland for far too long<U+201D>, said Cardinal Brady.<ref name=Spero />
  
The bishops offered four immediate responses to address the issues raised in the report: 
  
*Sadness over the "suffering of so many for so long." 
*An invitation to survivors to "engage with us" in an effort to understand how to assist the victims of abuse. 
*The intention to respond as pastors "despite the inadequacies at times of our previous pastoral responses." 
*Praying for the "well being and peace of mind for all who suffered" and urging all Catholics to join them in prayer.

===Response by religious orders===
Following a June 4 meeting with the Irish government, the 18 Irish religious orders implicated in the abuse have agreed to increase their contribution to the compensation fund for victims.  The orders also agreed to an independent audit of their assets, so that their ability to pay further compensation can be determined.  In a joint statement following the meeting, the orders said they were willing "to make financial and other contributions toward a broad range of measures, designed to alleviate the hurt caused to people who were abused in their care."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.americancatholic.org/news/report.aspx?id=1190 |first=Cian |last=Molloy                   |title=Irish religious orders agree to boost compensation for abuse victims}}</ref>

==Summary of diocesan sexual abuse inquiries==
===Archdiocese of Dublin ===
{{Main|Sexual abuse scandal in the Catholic archdiocese of Dublin|Murphy Report}}

Fr. [[Paul McGennis]], [[Dublin]], [[Ireland]]. He abused M Collins when as a 13-year-old she was in ''Our Lady's Hospital for Sick Children'' in 1961. Collins was later told that McGennis had admitted abusing children. However the Cardinal Archbishop of Dublin, [[Desmond Cardinal Connell|Desmond Connell]], refused "on legal advice" to supply his file on McGennis to the Irish police. McGennis was nevertheless convicted and gaoled. Collins subsequently received an apology from Cardinal Connell.

In November 2009, an independent report <ref>{{cite news|title =Report by Commission of Investigation into Catholic Archdiocese of Dublin|url=http://www.justice.ie/en/JELR/Pages/PB09000504}}</ref>commissioned by the Irish government investigated the way in which the church dealt with allegations of sexual abuse of children by priests over the period 1975 to 2004. It concluded that "the Dublin Archdiocese<U+201F>s pre-occupations in dealing with cases of child sexual abuse, at least until the mid 1990s, were the maintenance of secrecy, the avoidance of scandal, the protection of the reputation of the Church, and the preservation of its assets. All other considerations, including the welfare of children and justice for victims, were subordinated to these priorities. The Archdiocese did not implement its own canon law rules and did its best to avoid any application of the law of the State".

===Diocese of Ferns===
{{Main|Ferns Report}}
The [[Ferns Report|Ferns Inquiry]] 2005 - On 22 October 2005 a government-commissioned report compiled by a former Irish Supreme Court judge delivered an indictment of the handling of clerical sex abuse in the Irish [[diocese of Ferns]]. The report revealed over 100 cases of child sex abuse in the  diocese, involving a number of clergymen, including Monsignor [[Ferns Inquiry#Miche.C3.A1l Ledwith|Miche<U+00E1>l Ledwidth]], the former head of the National Catholic seminary, [[St Patrick's College, Maynooth|Maynooth College]].

===Archdiocese of Tuam===
{{Main|McCoy Report}}
A eight-year (1999-2007) enquiry and report by Dr Elizabeth Healy and Dr Kevin McCoy into the [[Brothers of Charity]] Congregation's "Holy Family School" in [[Galway]], the major city of the archdiocese, and two other locations was made public in December 2007. 11 brothers and 7 other staff members were alleged to have abused 121 intellectually-disabled children in residential care in the period 1965-1998.

===Diocese of Cloyne===
{{Main|Sexual abuse scandal in Cloyne diocese}}

In 2008, bishop [[John Magee (bishop)|John Magee]] found himself at the center of a controversy surrounding his mishandling of child sex abuse cases in the diocese of Cloyne.  It transpired that he had failed to implement self-regulatory procedures agreed by the bishops of Ireland in 1996.  In February 2008, the Irish Government had referred two allegations of Child Sex Abuse to the National Board for Child Protection, an independent supervisory body established by the Irish bishops.  When the chief executive of that body made contact with the diocese on the matter, he was met with lack of cooperation.  Meetings held with him and representatives of the diocese in March failed to elicit his full cooperation with the National Board for Child Protection's investigation.  A report into diocesan oversight of alleged abusers is expected in 2010.

On 7 March 2009 Pope Benedict appointed Archbishop [[Dermot Clifford]] of [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Cashel and Emly|Cashel and Emly]] as [[apostolic administrator]] of the Cloyne diocese, though Bishop Magee remains Bishop in title.<ref name="it-apostolic-administrator">[http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/breaking/2009/0307/breaking12.htm Bishop Magee steps aside over Cloyne controversy], Eoin Burke-Kennedy, [[The Irish Times]], 7 March 2009, retrieved 9 March 2009</ref> <ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/northern_ireland/7930191.stm BBC]</ref>Bishop Magee requested that the Pope take this action on 4 February. Bishop Magee said that he would use the time to "''devote the necessary time and energy to cooperating fully with the government Commission of Inquiry into child protection practices and procedures in the diocese of Cloyne''".

===Diocese of Raphoe===
{{Main|Sexual abuse scandal in Raphoe diocese}}
The current [[Bishop of Derry]], [[S<U+00E9>amus Hegarty]], was Bishop of the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Raphoe|Diocese of Raphoe]] in 1982-1994, at a time when one of his priests, Father Eugene Greene, managed to rape 26 young men.

==Abuse by Religious Orders==
{{main|Abuse by members of Roman Catholic orders}}
As well as the diocesan clergy, a number of Irish members of Catholic Orders have been named in criminal prosecutions for abuse; some were tried outside Ireland. These cases amplify, but were not covered by, the [[Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse]] findings (see above).

==Other cases==
As well the reports, many other victims of clerical abuse came forward with their own stories; including [[Gabriel Byrne]]<ref>[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/ireland/article5337389.ece Times online; 14 Dec 2008]</ref> and Derry Morgan.<ref>Sunday Independent, 27 Dec 2009, p.14.</ref> In each case the victim was told to keep quiet, and the priest involved was usually admired by the victim's family; this made it impossible for victims to speak out, adding long-term psychological injury to the abuse itself.

In 2010 Fr. Patrick Hughes was convicted on four counts of indecent assault.<ref name="it-patrick-hughes">[http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/ireland/2010/0203/1224263660114.html Former priest who sexually abused boy jailed for one year], [[The Irish Times]], 3 February 2010, retrieved 4 February 2010</ref> Detective Seargeant Joseph McLoughlin said that the [[Garda S<U+00ED>och<U+00E1>na]] were <U+201C>getting the run-around from church authorities<U+201D>.<ref name="it-patrick-hughes"/>

Investigations continue where Irish abusers were sent abroad by the church to other countries, where they abused other children.<ref>[http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/12/28/AR2009122801832.html WPost article Dec 2009]</ref>
