'''''The Clean House''''' is a play by [[Sarah Ruhl]], which premiered in [[2004]] at [[Yale Repertory Theatre]] and has since been produced in many American cities.  The play is a whimsical romantic comedy centered on Matilde, a [[Brazil]]ian cleaning woman who would rather be a comedian.

==Plot summary==

The play opens with three characters coming out to address the audience. Matilde comes out first, telling an elaborate joke in Portuguese without translation. Next Lane, a doctor in her 50s, come out to explain that her maid from Brazil has been failing to clean her house and so she had her medicated. She is followed by Virginia, Lane's older sister, who argues that people who do not clean their own homes are insane. Matilde finally comes back on stage to tell the audience, this time in English, about how her parents, both wonderful comedians, recently died. Not knowing what to do with herself after, Matilde came to America to clean this house.

The play then begins with Lane and Matilde still trying to work out their situation, especially since Lane feels uncomfortable having to order Matilde around and Matilde does not seem to be cleaning. While Lane is at work, Virginia, Lane's sister, a housewife and obsessive cleaner, comes to visit Matilde, having heard she was sad. Matilde explains that she doesn't like to clean and Virginia offers to clean the house for her before Lane comes home from the hospital.

Soon after, Matilde and Virginia discover panties in Lane's laundry that look too sexy for her and begin suspecting her husband Charles, also a doctor, is cheating on her. Their suspicions are confirmed when Lane tells them that Charles has left her for an older woman named Ana, a patient of his who had breast cancer and is now recovering from a mastectomy. Lane discovers that her sister had been cleaning the house instead of the maid. Lane, already upset, fires Matilde. Right before Matilde's departure, the maid sees Lane's imagined idea of Charles and his lover. She tries to tell Lane a joke, but as it is in Portuguese, Lane can't understand it. She tries to laugh, but just ends up crying. Virginia then enters to tell the two that Charles and the woman he loves is at the door. The act ends with Charles calling to Lane from offstage.

The second act begins with Ana, a free-spirited Argentine, and Charles, who are the same actors who have been playing Matilde's parents during act 1. Charles performs surgery on Ana and then they act out the scene where they meet for the first time and fall in love in a matter of moments. The play then deposits the characters back to where act 1 ended, as Ana and Charles are let into the house awkwardly. Ana and Matilde bond immediately.  Charles tells Lane that Ana is his [[Shidduch#Bashert|Bashert]] (soul mate) and that, according to Jewish law, this means that their marriage is dissolved. Lane doesn't know how to react, though she is clearly upset and bitter about the turn of events. Ana, after learning Matilde was just fired by Lane, offers for Matilde to come and clean their house. Lane, taking her aggression out on Ana, argues that she relies on Matilde and couldn't bear to part with her. Matilde, now being fought over by the two women, decides to split her time between both of their houses. Charles, Ana, and Matilde leave to go apple picking.

Matilde and Ana converse in their respective languages on Ana's balcony, eating apples and throwing them into the 'sea,' which also happens to be Lane's living room. Meanwhile, back at Lane's house, she and her sister fight, with Lane taking out her frustration over the situation on Virginia's obsessive cleaning. 

Ana and Charles fight over her going back to the hospital. Charles wants her to fight her cancer more aggressively, with Ana refusing to subject herself to more hospitals. Matilde watches as the two react to Ana's illness in their separate ways. While standing alone on Ana's balcony, Matilde discovers her 'perfect joke' and realizes that it did not kill her after all.

Soon, Matilde arrives back at Lane's home with news that Ana's cancer has come back and that she refuses to go to a hospital. She tells them that Charles, frantic for his lover's health, has gone to Alaska to cut down a Yew tree, which supposedly has healing powers. Matilde manages to convince Lane to visit Ana in a medical capacity. While at Ana's home, Lane examines Ana with an air of coldness before breaking down and yelling at her for making Charles love her in a way he never loved Lane. The two women share a moment, and Lane manages to forgive Ana.

Lane allows Ana to move in with her while Charles is away. As time passes, Charles sends a telegram, telling Ana that he has found a tree, but cannot get it onto a plane. He asks her to wait as he learns to fly a plane himself. Ana's condition, however, quickly worsens, and unwilling to have cancer beat her, she asks Matilde to kill her with a joke. Matilde reluctantly agrees. The next morning, she tells Ana her perfect joke. As Matilde whispers in Ana's ear, beautiful music plays over the audience and Ana laughs until she dies in Matilde's arms. Matilde sobs, and upon hearing the noise, Lane and Virginia come back into the room. Virginia says a prayer over the body. It is here that Charles returns with his tree. Lane meets him at the door, where she lets him know what happened and forgives him. He hands her the tree as he goes to approach the body.

Matilde ends the play imagining her mother laughing as she gave birth to her. Ana and Charles transform back into her parents and there is a moment of completion between the three of them. Matilde has come full circle with her parents, from death back to birth, finding finality and closure in the moment.

The last line of the play is Matilde's as she tells the audience:

"I think heaven is a sea of untranslatable jokes, except everyone is laughing"
