'''Project Gunrunner''' is a project of the [[Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives|U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives]] (ATF) intended to stem the flow of [[firearms]] into [[Mexico]], in an attempt to deprive the Mexican drug cartels of weapons.<ref>[http://www.atf.gov/publications/factsheets/factsheet-project-gunrunner.html Project Gunrunner]</ref>

The primary tactic of Project Gunrunner is interdiction of straw purchasers and unlicensed dealers to prevent legal guns from entering the black market; between 2005 and 2008, 650 such cases involving 1,400 offenders and 12,000 firearms were referred for prosecution.<ref>[http://www.fbi.gov/news/pressrel/press-releases/fact-sheet-department-of-justice-efforts-to-combat-mexican-drug-cartels Fact Sheet: Department of Justice Efforts to Combat Mexican Drug Cartels, April 02, 2009.]</ref> However other tactics ("gunwalking" and "controlled delivery") have lead to controversy.

In early 2011, the project became controversial when it was revealed that [[ATF gunwalking scandal|Operation Wide Receiver (2006-2007) and Operation Fast and Furious (2009-2010)]] had allowed guns to "walk" into the hands of Mexican drug cartels.<ref name="npr1">{{cite web|title=AP Exclusive: Second Bush-Era Gun-Smuggling Probe|url=

==History==
The ATF began Project Gunrunner as a pilot project in Laredo, Texas, in 2005 and expanded it as a national initiative in 2006. Project Gunrunner is also part of the [[United States Department of Justice|Department of Justice]]<U+2019>s broader Southwest Border Initiative, which seeks to reduce cross-border drug and firearms trafficking and the high level of violence associated with these activities on both sides of the border.<ref>{{Cite document | contribution = Preliminary review by the Department of Justice implementation of Project Gunrunner on the illicit trafficking of guns from the United States to Mexico | title = Review of ATF<U+2019>s Project Gunrunner | publisher = U.S. Department of Justice - Office of the Inspector General | pages = 3 | date = September | year = 2010| id = | contribution-url = http://msnbcmedia.msn.com/i/msnbc/sections/news/OIG_report.pdf | format = PDF | accessdate = 2010-11-13 | postscript = <!-- Bot inserted parameter.

ATF had determined that the Mexican cartels had become the leading gun trafficking organizations operating in the southwest U.S. and is working in collaboration with other agencies and the Government of Mexico to expand the [[eTrace]] firearm tracing software system.<ref name=Hoover >{{Cite document| first=William | last=Hoover| coauthors=| contribution=STATEMENT AT THE UNITED STATES HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES COMMITTEE ON FOREIGN AFFAIRS SUBCOMMITTEE ON THE WESTERN HEMISPHERE| title=Statement by William Hoover, Assistant Director for Field Operations, Bureau of ATF| editor-first=| editor-last=| publisher=UNITED STATES HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES - COMMITTEE ON FOREIGN AFFAIRS| place=Washington, D.C.| pages=| date=February 7| year=2008| id= | contribution-url=http://foreignaffairs.house.gov/110/hoo020708.htm| format=| accessdate=2009-03-21| editors=| postscript=. }}</ref> eTrace provides web based access to ATF<U+2019>s Firearms Tracing System to allow law enforcement both domestically and internationally the ability to trace firearms encountered in connection with a criminal investigation to the first recorded purchaser<ref>[http://www.state.gov/p/wha/rls/fs/2009/121671.htm eTrace: Internet-based Firearms Tracing and Analysis<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref name=autogenerated2>[http://www.atf.gov/publications/factsheets/factsheet-etrace.html ATF Fact Sheet - eTrace: Internet-Based Firearms Tracing and Analysis<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref name=autogenerated1>[http://www.gao.gov/new.items/d09709.pdf GAO-09-709 Firearms Trafficking: U.S. Efforts to Combat Arms Trafficking to Mexico Face Planning and Coordination Challenges<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> (who may have innocently sold the gun years ago).  eTrace allows law enforcement to access their trace results directly (name and address of first purchaser) and offers the ability to generate statistical reports to analyze their trace data to estimate firearms trafficking trends or patterns.

ATF announced a goal to deploy eTrace software to all thirty-one states within the Republic of Mexico.  As part of eTrace expansion, ATF continues to provide training to Mexican and Central American countries to ensure that the technology is utilized to a greater extent.<ref name=Hoover />  [[Colombia]] and [[Mexico]] were provided with their own in-country tracing centers with full access to ATF firearm registration records.  In Colombia, a joint ATF-CNP Center for Anti-Explosives Information and Firearms Tracing (CIARA) opened on December 6, 2006.<ref>[http://www.state.gov/documents/organization/125571.pdf Bureau of International Narcotics Matters End Use Monitoring (EUM) Report], CY 2006, U.S. State Department.</ref>  

In Mexico, The National Center for Information, Analysis and Planning in order to Fight Crime (CENAPI) was established in 2003.  ATF states these are models for planned future tracing centers throughout Central and South America and the Caribbean Basin.<ref>[http://www.justice.gov/jmd/2010justification/pdf/fy10-atf.pdf CBS<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> In December, 2009, ATF announced deployment of a Spanish version of eTrace to Mexico, Guatemala and Costa Rica.  

A planned second phase will release the software to all Spanish-speaking countries with agreements with ATF. In June 2011 Congress opened an investigation into Project Gunrunner against the ATF, as some ATF agents have come forward stating that top heads in ATF and the Department of Justice instructed the agents to encourage gun stores in the U.S. to sell assault-style weapons to Mexican firearm traffickers.

In 2009, the [[American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009]]<ref>[http://www.opencongress.org/bill/111-h1/text?version=enr&nid=t0:enr:232 H.R.1 - American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009]</ref> provided $40 million to state and local law enforcement agencies.  This money was primarily slated for competitive grants to provide assistance and equipment to local law enforcement along the southern border; and, in high-intensity drug trafficking areas, to combat criminal narcotics activity stemming from the southern border.  $10 million of the money was to be transferred to the BATF for Project Gunrunner to hire personnel and open facilities in 6 new locations.  The use of "stimulus" money to fund Project Gunrunner is controversial, given the ATF Phoenix Field Division's reported initiative of allowing known criminals to purchase guns in an effort to gain intelligence on the cartels ([[Operation Fast and Furious]]).

ATF has commissioned approximately 100 special agents and 25 industry operations investigators to the initiative,<ref name=Hoover /> and is increasing its intelligence activities with other EPIC law enforcement partners stationed at the border, including the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI), the [[Drug Enforcement Administration]] (DEA), [[Immigration and Customs Enforcement]] (ICE), [[Customs and Border Protection]] (CBP) and the Texas Department of Public Safety.  ATF also works closely with these agencies<U+2019> task forces which operate along the Southwest border, sharing intelligence, and conducting joint investigations.

==Operations==
By early 2009, Project Gunrunner had resulted in approximately 650 cases by ATF, in which more than 1,400 defendants were referred for prosecution in federal and state courts and more than 12,000 firearms were involved.<ref name=fbi >{{cite news | first= | last= | coauthors= |authorlink= | title=FBI Fact Sheet: Department of Justice efforts to combat Mexican Drug Cartels | date=April 2, 2009 | publisher=Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) | url =http://www.fbi.gov/news/pressrel/press-releases/fact-sheet-department-of-justice-efforts-to-combat-mexican-drug-cartels | work = | pages = | accessdate = 2009-04-04 | language = }}</ref>

According to the [[U.S. Government Accountability Office]] (GAO), during FY 2007 and 2008, ATF conducted twelve eTrace training sessions for Mexican police (over 961 Mexican police officers) in several Mexican cities, including the same cities where corrupt police were disarmed and arrested: [[Mexico City]], [[Tijuana]], [[Nuevo Laredo, Tamaulipas|Nuevo Laredo]], and [[Matamoros, Tamaulipas|Matamoros]].<ref name="09-709">[http://www.gao.gov/new.items/d09709.pdf GAO Report 09-709 (PDF)]</ref>  Despite the [[GAO]] report, ATF claimed in October 2010 only about 20 people have been trained to use eTrace in Mexico.<ref name='New Accord'>{{cite news | first = KATHERINE | last = CORCORAN | title = ATF: New accord with Mexico will boost gun traces | date = 2010-10-06 | publisher = Yahoo News | url = http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20101006/ap_on_re_la_am_ca/lt_mexico_weapons_trafficking | work = Associated Press | accessdate = 2010-12-17 | quote = About 20 people have been trained to use eTrace in Mexico.}}</ref>  This discrepancy has not been explained.

ATF reported they analyzed firearms seizures in Mexico from FY 2005-07 and identified the following weapons most commonly used by drug traffickers.<ref>[http://www.atf.gov/publications/factsheets/factsheet-project-gunrunner.html ATF Fact Sheet - Project Gunrunner<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>  However this conclusion is seriously flawed and not supported by ATF statistics, which only includes guns successfully traced and these are not necessarily connected to drug traffickers.  The number of trace requests from Mexico has increased since FY 2006, but most seized guns in Mexico have not been traced as only guns originally from the United States are traced.<ref name='OIG' >{{Cite document | first = U.S. Office of the Inspector General (OIG) - Evaluation and Inspections Division | contribution = OIG Review of ATF<U+2019>s Project Gunrunner | title = Review by the Office Inspector General (OIG) of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives<U+2019> (ATF) implementation of Project Gunrunner | publisher = U.S. Department of Justice | place = U.S.A. | date = November | year = 2010| id = | contribution-url = http://www.justice.gov/oig/reports/ATF/e1101.pdf | format = PDF | accessdate = 2010-11-21 | postscript = <!-- Bot inserted parameter.
