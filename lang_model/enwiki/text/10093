'''Latasha Nashay Byears''' (born [[August 12]], [[1973]] in [[Memphis, Tennessee]]) is a professional [[women's basketball]] player who plays for the [[Houston Comets]] in the [[Women's National Basketball Association|WNBA]]. Byears, who previously played for the [[Sacramento Monarchs]], the [[Los Angeles Sparks]], and the [[Washington Mystics]], ranked eighth all-time in field goal percentage (.514) and was among the top 10 rebounders in the league's history as of 2003.

Nicknamed "Tot", Byears usually played the position of [[power forward (basketball)|power forward]]. However, the openly [[lesbian]] Byears became more well-known for her troubles on and off the basketball court.

In November 2006 Byears joined the Bulgarian team of [[CSKA Sofia]].

== College years ==
Byears grew up in [[Millington, Tennessee]] and went to [[high school]] in nearby [[Arlington, Tennessee]]. Afterwards, Byears played two years in Northeastern Oklahoma A&M, located in [[Miami, Oklahoma]].  She later transferred to [[DePaul University]] in [[Chicago]], where she averaged 22.8 points and 11.7 [[rebounds]] per game during the [[1995]]-[[1996]] season, a performance that earned her a first team [[All-America|All-American]].

== WNBA career ==
Despite not being selected at the first [[WNBA Draft]], the [[Sacramento Monarchs]] invited Byears to their training camp prior to their inaugural season in [[1997]].  Byears then starred for the Monarchs for the next four seasons, making headlines for her rough play, including throwing a ball at the face of [[Seattle Storm]] player [[Michelle Marciniak]].

Byears was traded to the [[Los Angeles Sparks]] after the [[2000]] season ended, where she excelled. However, following a [[June 5]], [[2003]] Sparks game, Byears and three men unconnected to the Sparks were investigated for an alleged [[rape]] of a WNBA player. Byears was cut by the Sparks at the beginning of the season.  Four months later, in light of [[Kobe Bryant|Kobe Bryant's]] rape allegations and how the [[Los Angeles Lakers]], who owned the Sparks at the time, supported Bryant during the allegations, Byears sued the Lakers, accusing the team of double standards.  The criminal proceedings would eventually be closed in August [[2005]] due to insufficient evidence, and Byears's lawsuit against the Lakers was settled just months later.  Shortly after settling the lawsuit, Byears returned to the WNBA after a two-year absence, signing with the Mystics.

In [[2007]], Byears signed a [[free agent]] contract with the [[Houston Comets]], she was briefly waived in 2008, before being re-signed after an unimpressive start by the team.
