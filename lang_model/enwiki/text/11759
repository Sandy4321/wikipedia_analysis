'''''Bull Durham''''' is a 1988 American romantic comedy [[baseball]] film. It is based upon the [[minor league baseball|minor league]] experiences of [[writer]]/[[Film director|director]] [[Ron Shelton]] and depicts the players and fans of the [[Durham Bulls]], a [[minor league baseball]] team in [[Durham, North Carolina]].

The film stars [[Kevin Costner]] as "Crash" Davis, a veteran catcher brought in to teach rookie pitcher Ebby Calvin "Nuke" LaLoosh ([[Tim Robbins]]) about the game in preparation for reaching the Major Leagues. Baseball groupie Annie Savoy ([[Susan Sarandon]]) romances Nuke but finds herself increasingly attracted to Crash. Also featured are [[Robert Wuhl]] and [[Trey Wilson]], as well as popular baseball "clown" [[Max Patkin]].

Baseball movies were not considered a viable commercial prospect at the time and every studio passed except for [[Orion Pictures]], which gave Shelton a [[USD]] $9 million budget, an eight-week shooting schedule, and creative freedom. Even so, many cast members accepted salaries lower than their usual due to their enthusiasm for the material. Costner was cast because of the actor's natural athletic ability. During filming, Costner was able to hit two home runs while the cameras were rolling.

''Bull Durham'' was a commercial success, grossing over $50 million in [[North America]], well above its estimated budget, and was a critical success as well. ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'' ranked it the #1 Greatest Sports Movie of all time. ''[[The Moving Arts Film Journal]]'' ranked it #3 on its list of the 25 Greatest Sports Movies of All-Time.  In addition, the film is ranked #55 on [[Bravo (US TV channel)|Bravo's]] "100 Funniest Movies." It is also ranked #97 on the [[American Film Institute|American Film Institute's]] "[[AFI's 100 Years... 100 Laughs|100 Years...100 Laughs]]" list, and #1 on [[Rotten Tomatoes]]' list of the 53 best reviewed sports movies of all time.

Bull Durham is rated R for profanity, intense sexuality, and nudity.
==Plot==
"Crash" Davis, a veteran of 12 years in the [[Minor League Baseball|minor leagues]], is sent down to the single-A (advanced) Bulls for a specific purpose: to educate hotshot rookie pitcher Ebby LaLoosh <!-- not yet "Nuke", so don't call him that here --> (Robbins, playing a character loosely based on [[Steve Dalkowski]])<ref>{{cite news | title=Steve Dalkowski had the stuff of legends | publisher=[[Los Angeles Times]] |url=http://www.latimes.com/sports/la-sp-dalkowski19-2009jul19,0,5571688.story | first=Ron | last=Shelton | date=July 19, 2009 | accessdate=2009-07-19}}</ref><ref>{{Cite document |last=McEntegart |first=Pete |title=Where Are They Now?

Crash immediately begins calling Ebby by the degrading nickname of "Meat", and they get off to a rocky start.

Thrown into the mix is Annie (Sarandon), a lifelong spiritual seeker who latched onto the "Church of Baseball" and has, every year, chosen one player on the Bulls to be her lover and student. Annie flirts with Crash and Ebby, but Crash walks out, saying he's too much a veteran to "try out" for anything. Before he leaves, Crash further sparks Annie's interest with a memorable speech in which he lists the things he "believes in".

[[File:Nukecrash.jpg|left|thumb|[[Tim Robbins]] as "Nuke" LaLoosh and [[Kevin Costner]] as "Crash" Davis.]]Despite some animosity between them, Annie and Crash work, in their own ways, to shape Ebby into a big-league pitcher. Annie plays mild bondage games, reads poetry to him, and gets him to think in different ways (and gives him the nickname "Nuke").  Crash forces Nuke to learn "not to think" by letting the catcher make the pitching calls (memorably at two points telling the batters what pitch is coming after Nuke rejects his calls), and lectures him about the pressure in facing [[Major League Baseball|major league]] hitters that can hit his "heat" ([[fastball]]s).
Crash also talks about the pleasure of life in "The Show" ([[Major League Baseball]]), which he briefly lived for "the 21 greatest days of my life" and to which he has tried for years to return.

Meanwhile, as Nuke matures, the relationship between Annie and Crash grows, until it becomes obvious that the two of them are a more appropriate match, except for the fact that Annie and Nuke are currently a couple.

After a rough start, Nuke becomes a dominant pitcher by mid-season. By the end of the movie, Nuke is called up to the majors and the Bulls, now having no use for his mentor, release Crash. This incites jealous anger in Crash, who is frustrated by Nuke's failure to recognize all the talent he was blessed with. Nuke leaves for the big leagues, ending his relationship with Annie, and Crash overcomes his jealousy to leave Nuke with some final words of advice.

Crash is released by the Bulls and joins another team, the [[Asheville Tourists]], and breaks the minor league record for career home runs. We see Nuke one last time, being interviewed by the press as a major leaguer, reciting the clich<U+00E9>d answers that Crash had taught him earlier. Crash then retires as a player and returns to Durham, where Annie tells him she's ready to give up her annual affairs with "boys". Crash tells her that he is thinking about becoming a manager for a minor league team in Visalia. Both characters end one phase of their lives and begin another, Annie and Crash dancing in her candle-lit living room.

==Background==
The film's name is based on the nickname for [[Durham, North Carolina]], which has been called "Bull Durham" since the 1800s, when the [[Blackwell Tobacco Company]] named its product "Bull" Durham tobacco, which soon became a well-known trademark. In 1898, [[James B. Duke]] purchased the company and renamed it the [[American Tobacco Company]]. By this time, the nickname Bull Durham had already stuck.

The film's writer and director, Ron Shelton, played [[minor league baseball]] for five years after graduating from [[Westmont College]] in [[Santa Barbara, California]]. Initially playing second base for the [[Baltimore Orioles]]' farm system, he moved from the Appalachian League to California and then Texas before finally playing [[Triple-A (baseball)|AAA baseball]] for the [[Rochester Red Wings]] in the [[International League]]. Shelton quit when he realized he would never become a major league player. "I was 25. In baseball, you feel 60 if you're not in the big leagues. I didn't want to become a Crash Davis", he said.<ref name= "Ansen, David">{{cite news| last = Ansen | first = David | authorlink = David Ansen| title = A Major-League Romp| work = [[Newsweek]]| pages =| publisher = | date = June 20, 1988| url = | accessdate = }}</ref>

He returned to school and earned an [[M.F.A.]] in sculpture at the [[University of Arizona]] before moving to [[Los Angeles]] to join the city's art scene. However, he felt more kinship in telling stories than in creating performance art. His break into filmmaking was second unit work on the films ''[[Under Fire (film)|Under Fire]]'' and ''The Best of Times'' (both of which he also wrote).<ref name= "Ansen, David"/>

== Production ==
According to Shelton, "I wrote a very early script about minor league baseball; the only thing it had in common with ''Bull Durham'' was that it was about a pitcher and a catcher."<ref name="eightmillion"/> That script was entitled, ''The Player To Be Named Later''; a single anecdote from that script made it into ''Bull Durham''.<ref name= "Ansen, David"/> For ''Bull Durham'', Shelton "decided to see if a woman could tell the story" and "dictated that opening monologue on a little micro-recorder while I was driving around North Carolina."<ref name="eightmillion"/>

Crash was named after [[Lawrence "Crash" Davis]] but was modeled after Pike Bishop, the lead character [[William Holden]] played in ''[[The Wild Bunch]]'': a guy who "loved something more than it loved him."<ref name="eightmillion"/>  Annie Savoy's name was a combination of the nickname ("Annies") that baseball players gave their groupies and the name of a bar; she
was a "High Priestess [who] could lead us into a man<U+2019>s world, and shine a light on it. And she would be very sensual, and sexual, yet she<U+2019>d live by her own rigorous moral code. It seemed like a character we hadn<U+2019>t seen before."<ref name="eightmillion"/>  After Shelton returned to Los Angeles from his road trip, he wrote the script for ''Bull Durham'' in "about twelve weeks."<ref name="eightmillion"/>

When Shelton pitched ''Bull Durham'', he had a hard time convincing a studio to give him the opportunity to direct.<ref name= "Ansen, David"/> Baseball movies were not considered a viable commercial prospect at the time and every studio passed except for [[Orion Pictures]] who gave him a $9 million budget (with many cast members accepting lower than usual salaries because of the material), an eight-week shooting schedule and creative freedom.<ref name= "Ansen, David"/> Shelton scouted locations throughout the [[southern United States]] before settling on Durham in North Carolina because of [[Durham Athletic Park|its old ballpark]] and its location, "among abandoned tobacco warehouses and on the edge of an abandoned downtown and in the middle of a residential neighborhood where people could walk".<ref name= "associatedpress">{{cite news

Shelton cast Costner because of the actor's natural athleticism.

Producer [[Thom Mount]] (who is part owner of the real Durham Bulls) hired Pete Bock, a former semi-pro baseball player, as a consultant on the film.  Bock recruited more than a dozen minor-league players, ran a tryout camp to recruit an additional 40 to 50 players from lesser ranks, hired several minor-league umpires and conducted two-a-day workouts and practice games with Tim Robbins pitching and Kevin Costner catching.<ref name= "Ansen, David"/> Bock made sure the actors looked and acted like ballplayers and that the real players acted convincingly in front of the cameras. He said, <U+201C>the director would say, 'This is the shot we want. What we need is the left fielder throwing a one-hopper to the plate. Then we need a good collision at the plate.'

The scene in the pool hall where Nuke tells Crash that he is going to "the Show" was originally shot in a black whorehouse with Costner's character playing "[[Unchained Melody]]" on the piano to a 60-year-old hooker while drunk. Nuke came in and the two men fought in an alley with several black hookers cheering Crash on. Costner remembers, "The pool hall was somehow thought to be a better experience for the audience, because we didn't want to see him with a black woman, I guess. But it was perfectly in line with who he was".<ref name= "Vary, Adam">{{cite news

The film was well-received critically. It currently has a rating of 98% on [[Rotten Tomatoes]]. [[Metacritic]] reported the film had an average score of 73 out of 100, based on 16 reviews. In [[David Ansen]]<U+2019>s review for ''[[Newsweek]]'' magazine, he wrote that the film <U+201C>works equally as a love story, a baseball fable and a comedy, while ignoring the clich<U+00E9>s of each genre<U+201D>.<ref name= "Ansen, David"/> [[Vincent Canby]] praised Shelton<U+2019>s direction in his review for the ''[[New York Times]]'', <U+201C>he demonstrates the sort of expert comic timing and control that allow him to get in and out of situations so quickly that they're over before one has time to question them.

For years, Ron Shelton has contemplated making a sequel and remarked, "I couldn't figure out in the few years right after it came out, what do you do? Nuke's in the big leagues, Crash is managing in Visalia. Is Annie going to go to Visalia? I've been to Visalia. That will test a relationship ...
