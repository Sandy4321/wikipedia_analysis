==Political views==
===United States===
Margolis identifies his politics as "[[Dwight D. Eisenhower|Eisenhower]] [[United States Republican Party|Republican]]". Though his domestic political persuasion is moderately [[Conservatism|conservative]] (he is a staunch [[anti-communist]] and a supporter of [[capitalism]]), Margolis' views on the [[Middle East]] are sharply at odds with those of the [[neoconservatism (United States)|neoconservatives]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ericmargolis.com/political_commentaries/rogue--republican.aspx|title=Margolis declares his politics and admiration for Eisenhower|accessdate=2009-07-14 }}</ref>

Margolis wrote about [[Barack Obama|Barack Obama's]] election that:<blockquote>"Americans did not `liberate<U+2019> Iraq, but they certainly liberated their own nation last week by sweeping the Republican Party from power. One prays America<U+2019>s long nightmare of foreign aggressions, fear, religious extremism, and flirting with neo-fascism is finally at an end."<ref>{{cite web| last = Margolis| first = Eric| authorlink =| title = Obama<U+2019>s Very Long To-Do List| publisher = ericmargolis.com|month=November 10| year=2008| url = http://www.ericmargolis.com/political_commentaries/obamas-very-long-to-do-list.aspx| accessdate = 2009-10-21}}</ref></blockquote>

In a 2009 column, Margolis stated that an American politician he very much admires is [[Ron Paul]].<ref name="ronpaul">{{cite web

  | doi =
  | accessdate = 2009-10-21}}</ref> Margolis wrote about Paul:<blockquote>"I came to deeply respect and admire Paul<U+2019>s courage, honesty, and his refusal to accept special interest money...In fact, Rep. Paul has been a model of the type of legislators envisaged by America<U+2019>s founding fathers: men of high moral standards and intellect dedicated to the nation<U+2019>s wellbeing. He reminds me in many ways of the fiercely upright senators of the early Roman Republic".<ref name="ronpaul"/></blockquote>

Margolis has said he rejects the Republican Party of 2010 due to the growing influence of the [[Tea Party movement]] which he says now appeals to the fears and prejudices of its followers.<ref>http://vodpod.com/watch/3266004-eric-margolis-the-current-republican-party-appeals-to-fear-and-prejudice</ref>

====9/11====
Margolis has argued that the American government may have been behind the 9/11 attacks. On September 10, 2010, in a column on his website<ref>{{cite web|last=Margolis|first=Eric|title=9/11. THE MOTHER OF ALL COINCIDENCES.|publisher=eric margolis.com|date=Sept. 10, 2010|url=http://www.ericmargolis.com/political_commentaries/--the-mother-of-all-coincidences.aspx|accessdate=Sept. 25, 2010}}</ref> Margolis declares "we still do not know the real story about 9/11." Margolis' arguments include, the Osama Bin Laden tapes are fakes, questioning why the Air Force didn't shoot down the planes, asserting a lack of plane wreckage at the Pentagon, and repeating the theory that 9/11 was "staged by Israel<U+2019>s Mossad and a cabal of right-wing US Air Force generals<U+201D> without criticizing the theory. While saying there is no "hard evidence" that Americans were behind 9/11, he adds <U+201C>What, in the end, can we conclude? <U+2026> The attacks plunged America into wars against the Muslim world and enriched the US arms industry[,] boosted pro-Israel neo-conservatives [and] destroyed one of Israel<U+2019>s two main enemies."<ref>{{cite news|last=Kay|first=Jonathan|date=Sept. 14, 2010|title=Jonathan Kay on the sad descent into 9/11 conspiracism of former Toronto Sun columnist Eric Margolis|publisher=National Post|url=http://fullcomment.nationalpost.com/2010/09/14/jonathan-kay-on-the-sad-descent-into-911-conspiracism-of-former-toronto-sun-columnist-eric-margolis/|accessdate=Sept. 25, 2010}}</ref>

===Middle East===
Margolis is best known from his coverage of [[Palestine]] and [[Kashmir]]. Margolis' mother, Nexhmie Zaimi, was also a journalist who spent a long time in the Middle East documenting the plight of the Palestinians during the 1950s<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bigeye.com/060203.htm|title=Margolis writes of mother's coverage of Middle East June 2, 2003|accessdate=2009-07-14}}</ref>. Her influence, plus Margolis's role as a [[foreign correspondent]] in the Mideast and travelling with the [[mujahideen]] during the [[Soviet-Afghan War]], invested Margolis with a strong interest in the Muslim World. In a January 2009 column entitled "Eradicating Hamas", Margolis called the [[Gaza War]] a "final solution campaign" on the part of [[Israel]], and called [[Hamas]] a popular revolutionary movement that had stood up for the rights of Palestinians <U+201C>ethnically cleansed<U+201D> in 1948.<ref>[http://www.ericmargolis.com/political_commentaries/eradicating-hamas_1.asp "Eradicating Hamas"], ''ericmargolis.com'', January 12, 2009</ref>

===World history===
 	
In a November 2008 book review entitled "Deflating the Churchill Myth", Margolis in the ''[[Toronto Sun]]'' endorsed [[Pat Buchanan]]'s book ''[[Churchill, Hitler and the Unnecessary War]]'' as a "powerful new book".<ref name="EM_DefChuMyt">{{cite web|last=Margolis|first=Eric|title=Deflating the Churchill Myth|publisher=ericmargolis.com|month=November 17|year=2008|url=http://www.ericmargolis.com/political_commentaries/deflating-the-churchill-myth.aspx|accessdate=2009-10-21}}</ref> Margolis stated:<blockquote>"Buchanan<U+2019>s heretical view, and mine, is that the Western democracies should have let Hitler expand his ''Reich'' eastward until it inevitably went to war with the even more dangerous Soviet Union. Once these despotisms had exhausted themselves, the Western democracies would have been left dominating Europe. The lives of millions of Western civilians and soldiers would have been spared".<ref name="EM_DefChuMyt"/></blockquote> In a 2009 essay entitled "Don<U+2019>t Blame Hitler Alone For World War II", Margolis endorsed the claims of [[Viktor Suvorov]] that [[Operation Barbarossa]] was a "preventive war" forced on Hitler by alleged impending Soviet attack, and that is wrong to give Hitler "total blame" for World War II.<ref>{{cite web|last=Margolis|first=Eric|title=Don't Blame Hitler Alone For World War II|publisher=ericmargolis.com|month=September 7|year=2000|url=http://www.ericmargolis.com/political_commentaries/dont-blame-hitler-alone-for-world-war-ii.aspx|accessdate=2009-10-21}}</ref>
