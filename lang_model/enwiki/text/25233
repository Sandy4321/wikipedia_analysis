'''Round House''' (later, '''Garden of Paradise''') was a landmark building  on the west side of [[Main Street (Los Angeles)|Main Street]], below [[3rd Street, Los Angeles|Third]] in [[Los Angeles]], [[California]], US.

==History==
This land was granted by the [[Los Angeles City Hall|Ayuntamiento]] of the pueblo of Los Angeles to Juan Bouvette and Loreta Cota, his wife, August 31, 1847. On March 3, 1854, it was purchased by Remundo Alexander and Maria Valdez, his wife. Alexander was a native of France, and came to California as a sailor. In Africa, he had seen houses of stone built in cylindrical form. So when he married, Alexander varied the uniform style of building in Spanish-American countries and fashioned the adobe dwelling for his bride after the architecture of Africa.<ref name=Annual1901 /> For a time they lived in the house. 

On July 28, 1856, it was sold to George Lehman and his wife, Clara Snyder. Lehman was a native of Germany, familiarly known to his fellow-citizens as "Dutch George" or "Round House George".<ref name="Guinn1915">{{cite book|last=Guinn|first=James Miller|title=A History of California and an Extended History of Los Angeles and Environs: Also Containing Biographies of Well Known Citizens of the Past and Present|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=zxUVAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA279|edition=Public domain|year=1915|publisher=Historic Record Company|pages=279<U+2013>}}</ref> He was described as a good-natured, kind-hearted, well-meaning man, full of vagaries and fantastic notions. Lehman had a strange hallucination that he had found the [[Garden of Eden]], and he set to work to make his grounds as nearly as possible his conception of the dwelling place of [[Adam and Eve]]. He fitted up the grounds for a pleasure resort, and the building for a saloon. The grounds were referred to then as the Garden of Eden and Lehman named the resort the Garden of Paradise. The public garden was frequented especially on Sundays. This garden became a thicket of foliage and bloom to which Lehman charged a small admission fee; and he sold beer and pretzels in the shade. A music band was stationed on the balcony of the Round House and played at intervals.<ref name=Annual1901 /> 

For more than twenty years, this garden was one of the resorts of the town, and was used on public occasions, notably the country's centennial celebration of July 4, 1876. Lehman contracted debts he could not pay and on March 6, 1879, it passed out of his possession, sold under foreclosure of mortgage. The cactus hedge was cut down in July, 1886, when the city ordered the laying of cement sidewalks. The building was used as a school house after Lehman left it. Founded by [[Emma Marwedel]], it was home to [[Southern California]]<U+2019>s first [[kindergarten]],<ref name=Masters2013 /> and its first teacher was [[Kate Douglas Wiggin]].<ref name=Rasmussen1997>{{cite news|last1=Rasmussen|first1=Cecilia|title=A Garden Spot in Dusty Old L.A.|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1997-05-12/local/me-58028_1_outdoor-beer-garden|accessdate=31 July 2014|publisher=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=12 May 1997}}</ref> It was later a lodging house, and its last use was a dwelling for tramps.<ref name=Annual1901 /> The Round House was torn down in 1889.<ref name=Society1893>{{cite book|title=Annual Publications of the Historical Society of Southern California|author=Historical Society of Southern California|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=gAcVAAAAYAAJ&pg=RA2-PA68|edition=Public domain|year=1893|publisher=The Society|pages=68<U+2013>}}</ref>

==Architecture==
[[File:George Lehman's Round House main entrance (00078756).jpg|thumb|Main entrance]]

Alexander varied the uniform style of building in Spanish-American countries and fashioned the new adobe dwelling after the architecture of Africa. The building was two stories high, with an umbrella-shaped shingle roof. The walls were {{convert|1.5|feet}} deep.<ref name=Sutherland1965>{{cite journal|last1=Sutherland|first1=Henry A.|title=Requiem for the Los Angeles Philharmonic Auditorium|journal=Southern California Quarterly|date=September 1965|volume=47|issue=3|pages=303-331|url=http://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/41169943?uid=3739824&uid=2129&uid=2&uid=70&uid=4&uid=3739256&sid=21104420719897|publisher=University of California Press}}</ref> Mrs. Alexander thought it cost, with the lawn, from US$15,000-$20,000.<ref name=Annual1901 /> After Lehman came into possession of the Round House he enlarged it by enclosing it in a frame extension about {{convert|10|feet}} deep, which on the exterior was an octagon, and in the interior divided into additional rooms. Over the windows, he painted the names of the thirteen original States, with that of California added.<ref name=Annual1901 />

The building stood on lots 311, 313, 315, and 317 fronting {{convert|120|feet}} on Main Street and running through to [[Spring Street Financial District|Spring Street]]. Its exact location was {{convert|91.5|feet}} south of Third Street.<ref name="Annual1901">{{cite book|author=Historical Society of Southern California|title=Annual Publication of the Historical Society of Southern California and Pioneer Register, Los Angeles|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=vCkXAQAAMAAJ&pg=PA109|edition=Public domain|year=1901|publisher=The Society|pages=109<U+2013>}}</ref> The Main Street front of the Garden was later occupied by the [[Pinney Block]], the [[Pridham Block]] and [[Turnverein Hall]]. On the Spring Street front, lots 308, 310, 312, and 314, was a thick cactus hedge which barred entrance to the grounds from that street.<ref name=Society1893 /> The entrance to the garden was guarded by a row of [[Opuntia|''tunas'']], which extended across the Main and Spring streets sides that grew from {{convert|10|-|15|feet}} high. Lehman planted shade-giving pepper trees,<ref name=Masters2013>{{cite news|last1=Masters|first1=Nathan|title=CityDig: Is This 19th-Century L.A.<U+2019>s Most Eccentric House?|url=http://www.lamag.com/citythink/citythinkblog/2013/07/16/citydig-is-this-19th-century-las-most-eccentric-house|accessdate=31 July 2014|work=Los Angeles Magazine|date=16 July 2013}}</ref> and built a labyrinth of arbors, which in time were hidden under a profusion of vines and roses. He planted fruit and ornamental trees, shrubbery and plants. There were statues of Adam and Eve, [[Cain and Abel]], a serpent and  golden apples, as well as a frame work for flying horses for the amusement of children. Scattered about under the trees were effigies in cement of the animals which passed in review before Adam to receive their names.<ref name=Annual1901 />
