'''Milorganite(r) ''' is the brand name of an organic nitrogen [[fertilizer]] produced by the Milwaukee Metropolitan Sewerage District.   Popularized in the United States during the [[1940s]] and [[1950s]], it consists of processed [[sludge]] from the [[Milwaukee Metropolitan Sewerage District]] Jones Island Wastewater Treatment Plant in [[Milwaukee, Wisconsin|Milwaukee]], [[Wisconsin]]. The fertilizer is made up of microbes that have digested nutrients from the sewage stream along with added iron, used to strip phosphorus from the waste water flowing into Lake Michigan.

The name Milorganite is a contraction of the phrase ''Milwaukee Organic Nitrogen'', and was the result of a [[1925]] naming contest held in [[National Fertilizer Magazine]].

Milorganite(r) 6-2-0 is sold throughout the United States, Canada, the Caribbean and Pacific Rim as a homeowner and golf course fertilizer.

It is notable that according to the Washington State Department of Agriculture, Milorganite contains quantities of Lead(120ppm), Arsenic(7.2ppm) and Mercury (2.7ppm) that exceed almost all other commercial fertilizers for the lawn and garden. Ironite, another soil additive with much lower concentrations of Lead(3.12ppm), Arsenic(0.68ppm) Mercury(0.01ppm), has been subject to lawsuits and a ban in Canada due to its heavy metal content. See EPA statement on Ironite http://www.epa.gov/nrmrl/lrpcd/wm/projects/135367.htm.
