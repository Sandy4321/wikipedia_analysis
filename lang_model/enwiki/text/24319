'''''Dromaeosauroides''''' is a [[genus]] of [[dromaeosaurid]] [[theropod]] [[dinosaur]] from the Early [[Cretaceous]] of [[Denmark]]. It was discovered in the [[Jydegaard Formation]] in [[Robbedale]] on the island of [[Bornholm]] in the [[Baltic Sea]]. This is the only likely place for dinosaur remains to ever be discovered in Denmark, since the only [[Mesozoic]] deposits exposed in the rest of the country are marine. ''Dromaeosauroides'' is the first dinosaur known from Denmark and the only one scientifically named. It is also one of the oldest known definite dromaeosaurs in the world, and the first definite dromaeosaur known from the Early Cretaceous of Europe.

It is only known from two teeth, the first was found in 2000, the second in 2008. Based on the first tooth, the holotype specimen, the genus and species '''''Dromaeosauroides bornholmensis''''' was named in 2003. The genus name means "''[[Dromaeosaurus]]''-like", because of their similar teeth, and the species name means "from Bornholm". After this discovery, remains and tracks of more dinosaurs were found in several formations on Bornholm. Some teeth from Britain referred to the genus ''[[Nuthetes]]'' may also belong to this animal.

The holotype tooth is 21.7 mm (0.8 in) long, and the second tooth is 15 mm (0.5 in). They are curved and finely serrated. In life, ''Dromaeosauroides'' would have been 3-4 metres (9 ft 10 in-13 ft 1 in) in length, and weighed about 40 kg (88.2 lb). As a dromaeosaur it would have been covered in feathers, and bore a large "sickle claw" on its feet, like its relatives ''Dromaeosaurus'' and ''[[Deinonychus]]''. It lived on the coast of a lagoon environment alongside [[sauropods]], as evidenced by a possible [[titanosaur]] tooth.

==Discovery and naming==
[[File:Denmark location bornholm.svg|thumb|left|Map showing Bornholm (red) in relation to Denmark (yellow) and Scania (grey, above)]] 
Few [[dinosaur]] remains have been found in [[Scandinavia]]. The mainland of western [[Denmark]] is an unlikely region to find dinosaur remains, since the Mezosoic sediments there are exclusively [[Sea|marine]], [[Maastrichtian]] [[chalk]]. Fossils of marine animals such as [[mosasaurs]] and [[plesiosaurs]] have been found in these deposits.<ref name="Danish Dinos"/> Mesozoic deposits in [[Scania]], [[Sweden]], are much richer in fossils, including dinosaurs. The Danish island of [[Bornholm]] in the [[Baltic Sea]] was part of the same landmass as Scania (Scandinavian-Russian continent) and has a similar geology. The southwest part of the island is the only location in Denmark that has produced dinosaur remains so far.<ref name="Bernissart Dinosaurs"/> 

In the 1990s, the "Fossil Group/Project" (disbanded in 2005) was formed by a group of self-activating unemployed people, who successfully applied for funds from Denmark and the [[EEC]], to maintain geological locations on Bornholm.<ref name="Bernissart Dinosaurs"/> One of these sites is "Carl Nielsen's sandpit" in the [[Robbedale]] valley (not to be confused with the [[Robbedale Formation]], where no vertebrate remains have been found), which is a section of the [[Jydegaard Formation]]. This formation is 140 million years old, dating to the [[Late Berriasian]] (or Ryazanian) stage of the [[Early Cretaceous]] period. The "Fossil Group" sieved sand in these localities, and cooperated with the [[NaturBornholm]] [[Interpretation centre]], which also exhibited the fossils found. In September 2000, the Danish [[palaeontologists]] [[Per Christiansen]] and [[Niels Bonde]] taught a palaeontology field course at the site called "the hunt for Danish dinosaurs". On that occasion, young geology student Eliza Jarl Estrup found a [[theropod]] tooth, the first dinosaur discovered on Danish territory. The exact moment was filmed by local television.<ref name="Danish Dinos"/><ref name="JP DK">{{cite journal

==Description==
[[File:Dromaeosauroides size.jpg|thumb|left|Estimated size and placement of teeth]] 
Features used for identifying fossil theropod teeth include size, proportions and curvature of the crown, as well as the [[morphology (biology)|morphology]] and number of [[denticles]] (serrations). The [[holotype specimen]] of ''D. bornholmensis'' is a [[tooth crown]] which is 21.7 mm (0.8 in) long, 9.7 mm (0.4 in) from front to back at the base, and 6.6 mm (0.2 in) wide at the base. The front part of the tooth was worn, which indicates it was shed when the animal was alive. It was also further damaged by [[taphonomic]] wear, and the base of the tooth is irregular, so it may therefore have been slightly longer in life.<ref name="Danish Dinos"/> The curvature and length of the holotype tooth and the length of its hindmost cutting edge (carina) indicates it was placed in the front part of the jaws.<ref name="Bonde2008"/> The second known tooth is smaller, 15 mm (0.5 in), but otherwise has the same features as the holotype.<ref name="Bernissart Dinosaurs"/>
[[File:Dromaeosauroides.jpg|thumb|Hypothetical restoration, based on related genera]] 
The tooth is recurved with a backwards bend, and is oval in cross-section. The front and hindmost cutting edge of the tooth are finely serrated, and extend 2/3 down each edge.<ref name="Bonde2008"/> There are 6 denticles per every mm (0.04 in), and individual denticles are square shaped and chisel-like. The overall form of the tooth, width and shape in cross-section, as well as curvature, makes it very similar to those in the [[maxilla]] (upper jaw bone) and [[mandible]] of the species ''[[Dromaeosaurus albertensis]]'' from [[North America]]. Blood grooves are indistinct or absent, which is also similar to ''Dromaeosaurus'', but unlike members of the [[Velociraptorinae]] subfamily. ''Dromaeosauroides'' differs from ''Dromaeosaurus'' in that the cutting edge at the front side is not located as close to the middle of the tooth. And though the tooth is larger, and the denticles similar, each of them was smaller than those of ''Dromaeosaurus'', which only had 13-20 denticles per 5 mm (0.2 in), instead of the 30 of ''Dromaeosauroides''. <ref name="Danish Dinos">{{Cite doi|10.1016/S1631-0683(03)00009-5}}</ref> 

The holotype tooth is roughly 25% larger than equivalent teeth of ''Dromaeosaurus'', from which a body length of three metres (9 ft 10) or more was estimated for ''Dromaeosauroides''.<ref name="Danish Dinos"/> The length may have been as much as 3-4 m (9 ft 10 in-13 ft 1 in).<ref name="Bonde2008"/> In an interview, Christiansen estimated its skull to have been 35 cm (13.7 in) long, and the animal to have weighed 40 kg (88.2 lb). He also pointed out that a [[Bengal tiger]] of the same length would weigh 150-180 kg (330.6-396.8 lb) in comparison.<ref name="Fortidsmonstre">{{cite news | url= http://www.b.dk/danmark/fortidsmonstre-ser-dagens-lys | publisher= Berlingske | title= Fortidsmonstre ser dagens lys | first = J. | last = Ejsing   |language=Danish  | date=2003}}</ref> As a dromaeosaur, ''Dromaeosauroides'' would have been equipped with a large "sickle claw" on the highly mobile second toe, like its relatives ''Dromaeosaurus'', ''[[Velociraptor]]'', and ''[[Deinonychus]]''. This group is closely related to [[birds]]. The NaturBornholm interpretive centre houses a roughly life-sized sculpture of ''Dromaeosauroides'', covered in feathers. Later Chinese finds of well-preserved feathered dromaeosaurs indicate that the sculpture should have been covered in even more and longer feathers to be accurate. Though it is possible that some of the smaller dromaeosaurs were able to fly, it is not probable that this was the case for an animal the size of ''Dromaeosauroides''.<ref name="Bonde2008">{{cite book

==Classification==
[[File:Dromaeosaurus.jpg|thumb|Skull cast of the similar ''Dromaeosaurus'', Copenhagen]] 
Several features of the tooth are only known from members of the Dromaeosauridae family of theropod dinosaurs.<ref name="Bonde2008"/> The describers classified ''Dromaeosauroides'' as a member of the [[Dromaeosaurinae]] [[subfamily]] within the Dromaeosauridae, due to its specific similarities with ''Dromaeosaurus''. But despite the resemblance, ''Dromaeosauroides'' is not considered part of that same genus, as it is unlikely a genus would survive for 60 million years; ''Dromaeosauroides'' lived during the Early Cretaceous, whereas ''Dromaeosaurus'' lived during the [[Late Cretaceous]]. The differences between their denticles also indicate they should be kept separate.<ref name="Danish Dinos"/> 

''Dromaeosauroides'' is one of the oldest known dromaeosaurs in the world. Older remains have only tentatively been referred to Dromaeosauridae for the most part. ''Dromaeosauroides'' was the first definite dromaeosaurid known from the Early Cretaceous of Europe, depending on the identity of ''[[Nuthetes]]'' from the [[Middle Purbeck]] formation of Britain, which might be slightly older than the Jydegaard Formation. But it is uncertain whether the juvenile holotype specimen of ''Nuthetes'' in fact shows dromaeosaurid characteristics.<ref name="Danish Dinos"/> Large specimens (15-18 mm) referred to ''Nuthetes'' appear to belong to true dromaeosaurs, and may in fact belong to ''Dromaeosauroides'' itself rather than ''Nuthetes''.<ref name="Bernissart Dinosaurs">{{cite book

''Dromaeosauroides'' has been considered an indeterminate dromaeosaur by some scientists.<ref name="Danish teeth"/> Bonde responded that since the teeth differ from those of other dromaeosaurs from the Early Cretaceous, as well as later members of the group, including ''Dromaeosaurus'' itself, it should be considered valid. He also pointed out that these scientists had provided wrong information about the locality, strata and age of the specimen, and that the circumstances of its naming were no different from those of other tooth-based taxa.<ref name="Bernissart Dinosaurs"/>

==Palaeoecology==
Only a corner of the Jydegaard Formation is exposed today, the rest being overgrown with vegetation. Jydegaard is part of the [[Nyker Group]], which includes three formations (Rabekke, Robbedale, Jydegaard) ranging from the Berriasian to the [[Valanginian]] ages of the Early Cretaceous. Jydegaard consists of sediments deposited in a fresh to brackish [[lagoon]], which faced a coastal strip. Apart from ''Dromaeosauroides'' and the possible titanosaur, remains of [[hybodont sharks]], fish such as ''[[Lepidotes]]'' and ''[[Pleuropholis]]'', turtles, lizards, the [[crocodile]] ''[[Pholidosaurus]]'', and thin bone fragments from either birds or [[pterosaurs]], have been found in the deposit.<ref name="Danish Dinos"/> The bivalve ''[[Neomiodon]]'' is found in abundance in the sediments below (''Neomiodon'' Bed), which indicates a mass mortality perhaps due to [[dinoflagellate]] toxins.<ref name = BON04>{{Cite journal

The fish and bivalves were found in clay that probably represents a lagoon, the dinosaurs and lizards in sand that probably represents land or beach, and the turtles and crocodiles were found in both. Freshwater snails were found in clay that may have been shallow, drying lakes on the beach, on the back of a sandy barrier between the lagoon and the sea, in an environment perhaps similar to the [[Florida Keys]].<ref name="Bernissart Dinosaurs"/> Dinosaurs may have fed there, based on the remains of plants and small land animals, and theropods may have hunted along the shore.<ref name="Danish Dinos"/> Bornholm and Scania appear to be the only places were remains of the Scandinavian-Russian fauna of the Early Cretaceous can be found. Further investigations there may show whether this fauna has European or Asian affinities.<ref name="Bernissart Dinosaurs"/>
