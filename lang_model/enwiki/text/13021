'''Operation Bayonet Lightning''' was a military operation in [[Iraq]] designed to capture weapons, materials, and people that posed a threat against [[Coalition Forces]]. The joint operation, lasting about 16 hours, was conducted on [[December 2]], [[2003]] by 1200 troops from the [[173rd Airborne Brigade]] and Iraqi security forces. The operation was concentrated on [[Al Hawija]] and the village of [[Rashad]], 60 Kilometers (37 Miles) to the south of [[Kirkuk]]. 

Soldiers located and confiscated 62 [[AK-47]] assault rifles, 200 rounds of [[AK-47]] ammunition, one [[rocket propelled grenade]] launcher and two improvised explosive device making kits.
