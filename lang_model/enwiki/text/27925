The '''list of North Carolina hurricanes''' before [[1900]] encompasses 139&nbsp;[[tropical cyclone]]s that affected the [[U.S. state]] of [[North Carolina]]. Collectively, cyclones in North Carolina during the time period resulted in over 775&nbsp;direct fatalities during the period. Seven cyclones affected the state in the [[1893 Atlantic hurricane season|1893 season]], which was the year with the most tropical cyclones impacting the state during the time period. From the beginning of the official [[Atlantic hurricane]] record in [[1851]] to [[1899]], there were 12&nbsp;years without a known tropical cyclone affecting the state. The strongest hurricane to hit the state during the official record was the [[1899 Hurricane San Ciriaco|San Ciriaco hurricane of 1899]], which struck the state with winds of 120&nbsp;mph (195&nbsp;km/h).<ref>{{cite web|author=Hurricane Research Division|year=2007|title=Continental U.S. Hurricanes: 1851 to 1914|accessdate=2008-01-04|url=http://www.aoml.noaa.gov/hrd/hurdat/usland1851-1914-gt.txt}}</ref>

Historical data prior to 1700 is sparse due to lack of significant European settlements along the coastline; the few storms listed are largely records from [[Roanoke Colony]] and later the [[Province of Carolina]]. Modern meteorologists believe early storms were tropical cyclones, though due to the time period confirmation is impossible.<ref name="nc">{{cite web|author=James E.
