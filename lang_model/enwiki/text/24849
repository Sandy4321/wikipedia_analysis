The video opens with the camera rotating around Walker at an intersection as he slowly raises his head,<ref name="Clippin"/> before he is shown walking down a shop-lined street. As the song begins, Walker starts singing in an empty narrow alleyway. Examples of broken people are shown, such as a girl being pushed around and teased before she plugs headphones into her ears, a man watching over a hospital patient, and individuals waiting for others to show up. Walker passes a bench of people reading newspapers with the respective headlines, "Attacked", "War", "When Will It End?" and "Act of Hate", while the final newspaper headline reads "Hope". At the end of the video the now-"unbroken" characters are shown to be content, and Walker makes his way down a darkened alley.<ref name="Clippin"/>
