In 1997, Whedon created his first TV show, ''Buffy the Vampire Slayer''. The series depicts [[Buffy Summers]], the latest in a line of young women called to battle against [[Vampire (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|vampires]], [[Demon (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|demons]], and other forces of darkness. The inspiration for the idea came directly from his aversion to seeing the Hollywood formula of "the little blonde girl who goes into a dark alley and gets killed in every horror movie".<ref name="STARBURST">{{cite web|url=http://www.starburstmagazine.com/component/content/article/34-its-a-different-medium-you-idiot-/1570-buffy-the-vampire-slayer|title=Buffy the Vampire Slayer|first=Chris|last=Earl|date=December 14, 2011|publisher=starburstmagazine.com|accessdate=May 9, 2013}}</ref> Whedon said he wanted to subvert the idea and create someone who was a hero.<ref name="LOS ANGELES REVIEW OF BOOKS">{{cite web|url=http://lareviewofbooks.org/article.php?id=1553&fulltext=1|title=SXSW Critic<U+2019>s Notebook: Much Ado About What, Exactly?

The things that I don't like are kids acting like idiots, the devolution of the horror movie into [[Splatter film|torture porn]] and into a long series of sadistic comeuppances.

In July 2010 it was confirmed that Whedon would write and direct ''The Avengers'', a live-action adaptation of the superhero team [[Avengers (comics)|of the same name]].<ref name="/Film; The Avengers">{{cite web|url=http://www.slashfilm.com/joss-whedon-officially-directing-the-avengers/|title=Joss Whedon Officially Directing The Avengers|first=Devindra|last=Hardawar|date=July 22, 2010|publisher=slashfilm.com|accessdate=June 6, 2013}}</ref> On his desire to take on the film, he said, "It goes back to the very first incarnation of ''The Avengers'', it goes to ''[[The Ultimates (comic book)|The Ultimates]]'', it goes to everything about it. It makes no sense, it's ridiculous. [...] Ultimately these people don't belong together and the whole movie is about finding yourself from community. And finding that you not only belong together but you need each other, very much. Obviously this will be expressed through punching but it will be the heart of the film".<ref name="io9; The Avengers">{{cite web|url=http://io9.com/5595293/will-joss-whedons-avengers-movie-include-marvels-civil-war-we-asked-him|title=Joss Whedon says Captain America and Iron Man won't be pals in his "Avengers"|first=Meredith|last=Woerner|date=July 24, 2010|publisher=io9.com|accessdate=June 7, 2013}}</ref>

About the cinematography, DP [[Seamus McGarvey]] said that he and Whedon "were keen on having a very visceral and naturalistic quality to the image" and "wanted this to feel immersive and did not want a 'comic book look' that might distance an audience with the engagement of the film".<ref name="ARRI; The Avengers">{{cite web|url=http://www.arri.com/news.html?article=950&cHash=6adfecc263fdc3b7765b4e2f93a73f81|title=AVENGERS ASSEMBLE!|first=An|last=Tran|publisher=arri.com|accessdate=June 6, 2013}}</ref> They took use of the digital camera [[Arri Alexa]] when shooting the film.<ref name="ARRI; The Avengers" /> Whedon commented on the conversion of ''The Avengers'' [[2D to 3D conversion|from 2D to 3D]], saying that "current 3D conversion technology is really amazing, and Marvel is very picky. Having a sense for things in a 3D space and filming while feeling that space was a very easy thing for me. I<U+2019>m just tired of seeing just things flying toward the camera.

Despite the play's comedy, he discovered that there were elements in the text "of debauchery" that brought out a core darkness.

In March 2012, Whedon stated that although television involves more compromise than film:

{{quote|I think, ultimately, gun to my head, TV is the place.

He sold ''Suspension'' for $750,000, with an additional $250,000 if production had commenced.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR108182?refCatId=13|title='Suspension' toll: $ 1 mil from Largo|accessdate=December 15, 2009|author=John Brodie|date=June 25, 1993|publisher=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]}}</ref> It was described as "''Die Hard'' on a bridge". A year later, he sold ''Afterlife'' for $1.5 million, with an additional $500,000 if production had commenced. In 2000, [[Andy Tennant]] was in talks to direct and rewrite.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117779442?refCatId=13|title=Helmer Tennant believes in an 'Afterlife' with Sony|accessdate=December 15, 2009|author=Claude Brodesser and Paul F. Duke|date=March 14, 2000|publisher=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]}}</ref> In ''Afterlife'' there were precursors to themes Whedon would later explore in ''Dollhouse''. The script was about Daniel Hoffstetter, a government scientist, who awakes after dying to discover his mind has been imprinted on a mind-wiped body.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://io9.com/#!5374621/the-mind+transplant-script-whedon-wrote-before-dollhouse|title=The Mind-Transplant Script Whedon Wrote Before Dollhouse|accessdate=December 15, 2009|author=Lauren Davis|date=October 5, 2009|publisher=[[io9|io9.com]]}}</ref>

Whedon was hired to write and direct a [[Warner Bros.]] adaptation of ''[[Wonder Woman]]''. However, in February 2007 Whedon announced that he would no longer be involved with the project.

Lauded for his way of writing dialogue, many of Whedon's altered phrases and heavily popularized words have entered a common usage called "[[Slayer Slang: A Buffy the Vampire Slayer Lexicon|Slayer Slang]]", which [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]] included an entire section of in their article series ''[[Do You Speak American?]]''.<ref name="PBS">{{cite web|url=http://www.pbs.org/speak/words/sezwho/buffy/|title=Slayer Slang|publisher=pbs.org|accessdate=February 22, 2013}}</ref> In an issue of ''[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer Season Eight]]'', where Buffy travels to the future, Whedon writes Buffy's reaction to the future dialect of Manhattan; this allows Whedon to comment on the series' distinctive style of dialogue.

In late 2013 Whedon spoke at an Equality Now event, where he issued a pointed dissection of the word "[[:wikt:feminist|feminist]]". He begins to say, "I have the privilege living my life inside of words ... but part of being a writer is also living in the very smallest part of every word". Arguing against the suffix "[[:wikt:-ist|-ist]]", he continues, "you can't be born an <U+2013>ist. It's not natural". Whedon explains that because of this, the word "includes the idea that believing men and women to be equal ... is not a natural state. That we don<U+2019>t emerge assuming that everybody in the human race is a human. That the idea of equality is just an idea that<U+2019>s imposed on us..."<ref name="The Atlantic; feminism">{{cite web|url=http://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2013/11/what-joss-whedon-gets-wrong-about-the-word-feminist/281305/|title=What Joss Whedon Gets Wrong About the Word 'Feminist'|first=Noah|last=Berlatsky|date=November 8, 2013|publisher=theatlantic.com|accessdate=July 12, 2014}}</ref><ref name="TOR*COM; feminism">{{cite web|url=http://www.tor.com/blogs/2013/11/joss-whedon-hates-the-word-feminist-so-what-does-that-mean|title=Joss Whedon Hates the Word Feminist!

'''Note:''' Due to the frequency Whedon casts the same actors in various projects, the above list only includes those that have played three or more different roles in a Whedon production (actors that have only played the same role in multiple Whedon productions are not included).

==Personal life==
Whedon is married to Kai Cole, producer and co-founder of [[Bellwether Pictures]].<ref name="THE AUSTIN CHRONICLE; personal life">{{cite web|url=http://www.austinchronicle.com/screens/2013-03-08/home-movie/|title=Joss Whedon follows 'Avengers' with a Shakespearean labor of love filmed at his house|first=Robert|last=Faires|date=March 8, 2013|publisher=austinchronicle.com|accessdate=December 6, 2013}}</ref> They have two children and live in Los Angeles.<ref name="The Telegraph; personal life">{{cite web|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/film/film-news/8157067/Joss-Whedon-The-man-behind-the-Buffy-series.html|title=Joss Whedon: The man behind the Buffy series|first=Daisy|last=Dunn|date=November 24, 2010|publisher=telegraph.co.uk|accessdate=December 6, 2013}}</ref>

In 2013, Whedon revealed that he suffers from [[Workaholic|workaholism]].

Whedon has spoken about [[existentialism]], explaining in detail how it, and more specifically [[Jean-Paul Sartre]]'s ''[[Nausea (novel)|Nausea]]'', was used as a basis for the ''Firefly'' episode "[[Objects in Space]]".

===Political views===
In July 2012 at the [[San Diego Comic-Con International]], in response to one woman who noted the [[Anti-corporate activism|anti-corporate]] themes in many of his movies, and asked him to give his [[Philosophy and economics|economic philosophy]] in 30 seconds or less, Whedon spoke out against both the [[socialism]] he was brought up listening to and [[capitalism]] as well, stating that "ultimately all these systems don't work".  He went on to say that America is "turning into Tsarist Russia".<ref name="The Wrap">{{cite web|url=http://www.thewrap.com/tv/column-post/joss-whedon-america-turning-tsarist-russia-47756|title=Comic-Con 2012: Joss Whedon: America Is Turning Into <U+2018>Tsarist Russia<U+2019>|publisher=TheWrap.com|date=July 13, 2012|accessdate=July 28, 2012}}</ref>
