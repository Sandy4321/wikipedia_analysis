'''Cenk Kadir Uygur''' ({{IPA-tr|<U+02C8>d<U+0292><U+025B><U+014B>k <U+02C8>uj<U+0261>ur}}; born March 21, 1970) is a [[Turkish American]] political commentator, Internet personality, and political activist. Uygur is the main host and co-founder of the Internet [[talk radio]] show and eponymous television show, ''[[The Young Turks (talk show)|The Young Turks]]'' (''TYT''). Uygur is currently the chief news officer of [[Current TV]], succeeding [[Keith Olbermann]] following his departure from the cable television network.<ref name="guardian" /><ref name="announced" /> A naturalized U.S. citizen, Uygur was born in [[Turkey]] and raised from age eight in the United States. He worked as an attorney in Washington, D.C. and New York before beginning his career as a political commentator. Originally a moderate [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]], he is now a [[Progressivism in the United States|progressive]].<ref name="Progressive">{{cite journal|last=Rampell|first=Ed|title=Cenk Uygur|journal=The Progressive|volume=76|issue=8|url=http://www.questia.com/library/1G1-299257454/cenk-uygur|accessdate=June 30, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Cenk Uygur bringing Young Turks to TV|url=http://www.upi.com/Entertainment_News/TV/2011/09/20/Cenk-Uygur-bringing-Young-Turks-to-TV/UPI-47921316531009/|newspaper=UPI|date=Sept. 20, 2011}}</ref> In addition to hosting ''TYT'', Uygur appeared on [[MSNBC]] as a political commentator in 2010, later hosting a weeknight commentary show on the channel for nearly six months until being replaced by [[Al Sharpton]].<ref name="sharpton appears" /> Shortly after leaving MSNBC, Uygur secured a show on [[Current TV]] that began airing on December 5, 2011.<ref name="currenttv" />

==Early life, education, and career==
Uygur was born in [[Istanbul]], Turkey and emigrated with his family to the United States when he was eight years old.<ref name="coming"/> He grew up in [[East Brunswick Township, New Jersey]] and graduated from [[East Brunswick High School]]. He attended the Wharton School of Business at the [[University of Pennsylvania]] where he majored in management<ref name="where are"/> and was on the Student Activities Council representing the Turkish Students Association.<ref name="dispute raised"/> He also earned a law degree from [[Columbia Law School]]<ref name="huff po"/> and worked as an associate attorney at the [[law firm]]s of [[Drinker Biddle & Reath]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] and Hayes & Liebman in [[New York City]].<ref name="interview"/>

Uygur first appeared as a talk show host on a weekend [[radio show]] on [[WWRC]] in Washington, D.C. and on [[WRKO]] in [[Boston]]. He later wrote for, produced, and appeared on the [[WAMI-TV]] news show ''The Times'' in [[Miami]], then started ''The Young Turks'' on [[Sirius Satellite Radio]].<ref name="profile"/>

==Political views==
While in college, he wrote a column in ''[[The Daily Pennsylvanian]]'' criticizing [[affirmative action]] recruiting at the university and suggesting that all students should be "judged on their merits rather than their physical characteristics."<ref name="where are"/> He supported the pro-life position on the abortion issue, criticized the radical aspects of the feminist movement, and felt Supreme Court Justice [[Clarence Thomas]] was treated unjustly during his Senate confirmation hearings.<ref name="feminists"/> He also criticized organized religion as based on mythology and as a divisive force between peoples.<ref name="federation">{{cite web|url=http://thedp.com/node/31193|title=A Federation of Humanity|author=Cenk Uygur|work=The Daily Pennsylvanian|date=December 5, 1991|accessdate=July 22, 2011}}</ref>

He has stated that he worked for a time for [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] former [[New York's 20th congressional district|New York Congressman]] [[Joseph J. DioGuardi|Joe DioGuardi]].<ref name="2010MidtermsCoverage"/>

Uygur supported the [[Gulf War]] of 1990<U+2013>1991, and supported the [[War in Afghanistan (2001<U+2013>present)|War in Afghanistan]] from its beginning in 2001 until 2009<U+2014>though he has strongly opposed the [[Iraq War]].<ref name="YearlyKos"/> He supported the [[2011 military intervention in Libya]].

Uygur expressed [[Armenian Genocide denial|denial of the Armenian Genocide]] in letters published by ''The Daily Pennsylvanian'' in 1991 and ''[[Salon (website)|Salon]]'' in 1999, in one of which titled "Historical Fact or Falsehood?" he stated, "The claims of an Armenian Genocide are not based on historical facts. If the history of the period is examined it becomes evident that in fact no such genocide took place."<ref name='DP 1991-11-20'>{{cite web | url = http://thedp.com/r/6b702cbe | title = Historical Fact or Falsehood? | accessdate = 2012-06-20 | last = Uygur | first = Cenk | date = 1991-11-20 | work = The Daily Pennsylvanian | archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/68YqvmgSY | archivedate = 2012-06-20}}</ref><ref name='Shea 1999-06-09'>{{cite web | url =http://www.salon.com/1999/06/16/punk_2/ | title = Turko-Armenian war brews in the Ivory Tower | accessdate = 2012-06-20 | last = Shea | first = Chris | date = 1999-06-09 | work = Salon.com | archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/19990901032255/http://salon.com/letters/1999/06/16/punk/index1.html | archivedate = 1999-09-01}}</ref> In 2012, Uygur's letters later drew criticism from the west-coast affiliate of the [[Armenian National Committee of America]] and the California Armenian American Democrats who subsequently staged protests during his speech at the [[California Democratic Party]] 2012 State Convention with the support of [[Charles Calderon]] and [[Janice Hahn]].<ref>{{cite web|title=ANCA-WR OPEN LETTER TO CA DEMOCRATIC PARTY|url=http://www.anca.org/press_releases/press_releases.php?prid=2124|publisher=Armenian National Committee - Western Region}}</ref><ref name="The Armenian Reporter">{{cite web|title=Armenian Council of America on CA Democrats convention|url=http://www.reporter.am/go/article/2012-02-21-armenian-council-of-america-on-ca-democrats-convention-|publisher=CS Media|accessdate=16 June 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Armenians Protest Uygur Talk at Democratic Convention|url=http://asbarez.com/101017/armenians-protest-uygur-talk-at-democratic-convention/|accessdate=16 June 2012}}</ref>

Regarding the Armenian Genocide articles, [[Ana Kasparian]] stated in 2010 that "people change their political opinions all the time."<ref>{{cite web |last=Kasparian |first=Ana |url=https://twitter.com/AnaKasparian/status/17443931731 |publisher=Twitter |title=@AniSouriatzi You're quite... |deadurl=no |accessdate=February 26, 2013}}</ref> and that Uygur has acknowledged that massacres preceded an Armenian diaspora.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://alanakalanian.com/2012/03/03/ana-the-armenian-young-turk/ |title=ON ANA THE ARMENIAN YOUNG TURK<U+2026> |deadurl=no |accessdate=February 26, 2013}}</ref> At a progressive caucus of the California Democratic Party meeting on February 11, 2012, Cenk stressed that "The Young Turks" title referenced the phrase as it applies to any generic progressive political movement that threatens to upend the established order, and was not an endorsement of the Young Turks' regime in Turkey.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UzNhpD7U4-g |title=Cenk Uygur Fails To Address Past Comments Denying The Armenian Genocide |deadurl=no |accessdate=February 26, 2013}}</ref>

Uygur has changed his positions in recent years and is now a [[Progressivism in the United States|progressive]]<ref name=Progressive>.{{cite journal|last=Rampell|first=Ed|title=Cenk Uygur|journal=The Progressive|volume=76|issue=8|url=http://www.questia.com/library/1G1-299257454/cenk-uygur|accessdate=June 30, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Cenk Uygur bringing Young Turks to TV|url=http://www.upi.com/Entertainment_News/TV/2011/09/20/Cenk-Uygur-bringing-Young-Turks-to-TV/UPI-47921316531009/|newspaper=UPI|date=Sept. 20, 2011}}</ref> On social issues, Uygur is now [[pro-choice]] on [[abortion]] and supports [[LGBT rights in the United States|LGBT rights]], including [[Same-sex marriage in the United States|same-sex marriage]]. In 2009, he advocated the [[Drug liberalization|liberalization of drug laws]], arguing that the [[War on Drugs]] has been a failure, as shown by the continuing violence in Mexico and the border region. He also opposes imprisoning non-violent drug offenders for [[marijuana]] possession. He previously supported [[Capital punishment in the United States|capital punishment]], but now opposes it largely due to multiple exonerations of [[death row]] inmates since its [[Gregg v. Georgia|reinstatement]].

Uygur has expressed support for a return to [[Presidency of Bill Clinton|Clinton-era]] [[Income tax in the United States|income tax]] brackets and has criticized the  [[Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization, and Job Creation Act of 2010|2010 Obama<U+2013>GOP compromise]] which provided for a temporary extension of the [[Bush tax cuts]]. Uygur has stated that he favored [[Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Act|welfare reform]] as enacted under Bill Clinton. He has been critical of excessive regulation, but has argued that in recent decades, regulation of the [[financial sector]] has been inadequate. In particular, he faults the [[Deregulation|deregulatory]] policies of [[Ronald Reagan]], [[Bill Clinton]], and [[George W. Bush]]. He views the [[Gramm<U+2013>Leach<U+2013>Bliley Act|repeal]] (which Clinton signed into law) of the [[Glass<U+2013>Steagall Act]], as a major contributor to the [[late-2000s recession]]. However, on many issues Uygur maintains that many of his economic positions have not moved (he describes himself as a fiscal conservative in many cases), that instead the right wing has shifted by becoming more extreme even since the end of Bush's presidency, describing [[Texas]] governor [[Rick Perry]] as "George Bush on steroids".<ref name="Perry is Bush on Steroids"/>

On [[national security]] and [[Civil liberties in the United States|civil liberties]] issues, Uygur has strongly opposed the practices begun under the [[Presidency of George W. Bush|Bush administration]], of [[indefinite detention]], [[warrantless wiretapping]] and [[extraordinary rendition]], and believes that [[waterboarding]] is an illegal torture technique. Uygur has been a strong critic of Israeli Prime Minister [[Benjamin Netanyahu]] and the right-wing Israeli government and has stated that he is an advocate for a two state solution in the [[West Bank]] and has repeatedly criticized the Israeli government for its failure to materialize.<ref name="breakdown"/>

===On Democratic politicians and officeholders===
The [[United States presidential election, 2000|2000 election]] was the first time Uygur voted [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]], supporting [[Al Gore]]. Uygur has supported Democratic congressional and presidential candidates ever since, though he frequently criticized the Democratic congressional leadership for insufficiently opposing the Bush administration on civil liberties and foreign policy issues. Uygur has criticized [[Blue Dog Democrats]] and other centrist and [[conservative Democrat]]s, some of whom he has labeled as "[[corporatist]]s". He has described former [[Wisconsin]] Senator [[Russ Feingold]], a Democrat, as "probably the only guy in the whole entire Senate we can trust".<ref name="Feingold"/> When Feingold was defeated for reelection in [[United States Senate election in Wisconsin, 2010|2010]] by Republican [[Ron Johnson (Wisconsin politician)|Ron Johnson]], Uygur said Feingold had been "the best Senator we had, and we no longer have him".<ref name="2010MidtermsCoverage"/>

In part because of concerns over Bush's foreign policy and policies on civil liberties, Uygur said he would support an impeachment of Bush. Early in the [[Barack Obama presidential campaign, 2008|2008 Obama campaign]], Uygur questioned Obama's suitability for the presidency, saying Obama lacked political experience at the national level and had limited achievements in the U.S. Senate. However, he strongly supported Obama later on.

Since the fall of 2009, Uygur has taken an increasingly critical attitude towards the Obama administration, saying after two years in office, Obama is, "not a progressive .... He is a consummate politician."<ref name="obama vs himself"/> Uygur has criticized the [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act|2010 health insurance reform law]] as overly watered-down, owing to excessive concessions to business and conservatives in [[United States Congress|Congress]], noting the deal made between Obama and the drug companies.{{Clarify|date=June 2013}} Uygur has similarly criticized the [[Dodd<U+2013>Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act|2010 financial reform law]].{{why|date=August 2013}}

Uygur feels the Obama administration has too readily conceded to conservative ideological arguments to the point of demonstrating an unwillingness to defend [[Modern liberalism in the United States|liberal]] positions. However, Uygur voted for Obama in the 2012 presidential election,<ref>{{cite web|last=Uygur|first=Cenk|title=Why Obama Will Disappoint Progressives and I Voted for Him Anyway|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/cenk-uygur/why-obama-will-disappoint_b_2081870.html|publisher=The Huffington Post|accessdate=25 April 2013|date=6 November 2012}}</ref> despite his disagreements with the president.<ref>http://current.com/shows/the-young-turks/videos/four-bold-progressive-picks-for-congress-in-2012</ref>

==MSNBC==
On October 21, 2010 [[MSNBC]] announced that Uygur had been officially hired as a contributor and substitute anchor for the network. On January 21, 2011, it was announced that Uygur would be hosting the 6 p.m. Eastern slot on MSNBC as the anchor of a new prime time edition of [[MSNBC Live]], after the network parted ways with Keith Olbermann, resulting in a rearrangement of the timeslots of MSNBC's other prime time shows. Uygur filled the time slot vacated by [[Ed Schultz]],<ref name="olbermann leaves"/><ref name="hollywood"/> from late January through June 2011, earning first among people 18<U+2013>34 in the second quarter. His contract was ended when he did not accept a lower profile weekend slot.<ref name="sharpton appears"/> An MSNBC spokesperson expressed regret at Uygur's leaving.<ref name="leaving"/> Uygur gave his side of the story on ''[[Democracy Now!]]'', saying that MSNBC President Phil Griffin had called him into his office in April and told him that he had been talking to people in Washington and that they did not like Uygur's tone.<ref>[http://www.democracynow.org/2011/7/22/rejecting_lucrative_offer_cenk_uygur_leaves Cenk Uygur Leaves MSNBC After Being Told to "Act Like an Insider"]</ref> MSNBC denied the claim, saying that "We did have numerous conversations with Cenk about his style, not substance."<ref name="baseless"/>

Entertainment Television]], [[Aljazeera]], [[Russia Today|RT]], [[ABC News]], [[Voice of America]], [[NPR]] and the [[Fox News Channel]].<ref name="personal profile"/> He was a regular guest on ''[[The Dylan Ratigan Show]]'' for a segment opposite various conservative commentators.

[[Jon Stewart]] showed clips of Uygur on Comedy Central's ''[[The Daily Show]]'' in August and September 2010; in one instance Uygur spoke on [[Net neutrality|internet neutrality]], and in the other, he commented on pastor [[Terry Jones (pastor)|Terry Jones]] and his [[Dove World Outreach Center Quran-burning controversy|Koran burning controversy]].<ref name="cameo"/><ref name="stewart"/> On December 22, 2010 Uygur interviewed [[Wikileaks]] founder [[Julian Assange]] on MSNBC's ''The Dylan Ratigan Show''.<ref name="assange"/> He appeared on [[George Galloway]]'s political radio show on February 11, 2011 as an American correspondent, explaining problems he perceives with [[Politics of the United States|American politics]] for a British audience.<ref name="galloway"/> He hosted ''[[Good Day L.A.]]'' in March 2012.<ref>{{cite web |last=Uygur |first=Cenk |title=Tweet: Cenk Uygur hosting Good Day LA with Dorothy Lucey and Jillian Barberie.|url=http://twitter.com/#!/cenkuygur/status/177254340417949696 |publisher=[[Twitter.com]] |date=7 March 2012 |deadurl=no |accessdate=February 26, 2013}}</ref>

==Wolf-PAC==
{{Main|Wolf-PAC}}
In late 2011, after seeing the momentum of [[Occupy Wall Street]], Uygur decided to launch a long term project of his, a [[political action committee]] named Wolf-PAC. Wolf-PAC aims to lobby state legislators to pass resolutions calling for a [[Convention to propose amendments to the United States Constitution|constitutional convention]]. Its slogan is "A super-PAC to end all super-PACs". If this convention is formed the aim is then to pass an [[List of amendments to the United States Constitution|amendment]] to the [[United States Constitution]] that would end [[corporate personhood]] and publicly finance all elections in the United States.<ref>{{cite web |title=The Plan |url=http://www.wolf-pac.com/the_plan |work=Wolf PAC |deadurl=no |accessdate=February 26, 2013}}</ref>

==Personal life==
Uygur was born and raised in a [[Sunni Islam|Sunni Muslim]] family, but is now a self-described "fervent [[Agnosticism|agnostic]]".<ref name="six degrees"/><ref name="liberal"/> In 2010, along with [[Ayaan Hirsi Ali]], Uygur accepted the "Emperor Has No Clothes Award" from the [[Freedom From Religion Foundation]] and later the Humanist Media Award from the [[American Humanist Association]].<ref name="FFRF Award"/><ref name="AHA Award"/>  He is married to Wendy Lang Uygur, a marriage and family [[therapist]], who previously worked as a social worker<ref name="review"/> and now runs her own practice.
