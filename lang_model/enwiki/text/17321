The '''Red-billed Chough''' or '''Chough''' ({{pronEng|<U+02C8>t<U+0283><U+028C>f}} ''chuff''),  ''Pyrrhocorax pyrrhocorax'', is a [[bird]] in the [[crow]] family; it is one of only two species in the genus ''Pyrrhocorax''. Its eight [[subspecies]] breed on mountains and coastal cliffs from [[Ireland]] and [[Great Britain]] east through southern [[Europe]] and [[North Africa]] to [[Central Asia]], [[India]] and [[China]].

This bird has glossy black plumage, a long curved red bill, red legs, and a loud, ringing call. It  has a buoyant acrobatic flight with widely-spread [[Primary feather|primaries]]. The Red-billed Chough [[pair bond|pairs]] for life and displays [[philopatry|fidelity]] to its breeding site, which is usually a cave or crevice in a cliff face. It builds a wool-lined stick nest and lays three eggs. It feeds, often in flocks, on short grazed grassland, taking mainly [[invertebrate]] prey.

Although it is subject to predation and parasitism, the main threat to this species is changes in agricultural practices, which have led to population decline and range fragmentation in Europe; however, it is not threatened globally. The Red-billed Chough, which derived its common name from the [[Jackdaw]], was formerly associated with fire-raising, and has links with Saint [[Thomas Becket]] and the county of [[Cornwall]].

==Distribution and habitat==
[[Image:Berneray Machair (hazelisles).jpg|thumb|left|Machair habitat in [[Scotland]]]]
The Red-billed Chough breeds in Ireland, Great Britain, the [[Isle of Man]], southern Europe and the [[Mediterranean]] basin, the [[Alps]], and in mountainous country across Central Asia, India and China, with two separate populations in the Ethiopian Highlands. It is a [[bird migration|non-migratory resident]] throughout its range.<ref name= Madge94/>

Its main habitat is high mountains; it is found between 2,000 and 2,500&nbsp;metres (6,560&ndash;8,200&nbsp;ft) in North Africa, and mainly between  2,400 and 3,000&nbsp;metres (7,950&ndash;9,840&nbsp;ft) in the Himalayas. In that mountain range it reaches 6,000&nbsp;metres (19,650&nbsp;ft) in the summer, and has been recorded  at 7,950&nbsp;metres (26,080&nbsp;ft) altitude on [[Mount Everest]].<ref name= Madge94/> In Ireland, Great Britain and [[Brittany]] it also breeds on coastal sea cliffs, feeding on adjacent short grazed grassland or [[machair]]. It was formerly more widespread on coasts but has suffered from the loss of its specialised habitat.<ref name =RSPB >{{cite web|title= Chough |url= http://www.rspb.org.uk/ourwork/conservation/species/casestudies/chough.asp

==Description==
[[Image:Red billed Chough I IMG 3584.jpg|thumb|In flight]]
The adult of the nominate subspecies of the Red-billed Chough, ''P. p. pyrrhocorax'', is 39<U+2013>40&nbsp;centimetres (15<U+2013>16&nbsp;in) in length, has a 73<U+2013>90&nbsp;centimetres (29<U+2013>35&nbsp;in) wingspan,<ref name= BWP/> and weighs an average 310&nbsp;grammes (10.9&nbsp;oz).<ref name= BTO/> Its plumage is velvet-black,  green-glossed on the body, and it has a long  curved red bill and red legs. The  sexes are similar (although adults can be sexed in the hand using a formula involving [[Tarsus (skeleton)|tarsus]] length and bill width)<ref name= Blanco6>{{cite journal ||last= Blanco |first= Guillermo |coauthors= Tella, Jos<U+00E9> Luis; Torre, Ignacio |month= Summer |year=1996 |title= [http://elibrary.unm.edu/sora/JFO/v067n03/p0428-p0433.pdf Age and sex determination of monomorphic non-breeding choughs: a long-term study]  |journal= Journal of Field Ornithology |format = PDF|volume=67 |issue=3 |pages= 428<U+2013>433|  }}</ref> but the juvenile has an orange bill and pink legs until its first autumn, and less glossy plumage.<ref name= Madge94/> 

The Red-billed Chough is unlikely to be confused with any other species. Although the Jackdaw and Alpine Chough share its range, the Jackdaw is smaller and has unglossed grey plumage, and the Alpine Chough has a short yellow bill. Even in flight, the two choughs can be distinguished by Alpine's less rectangular wings, and longer, less square-ended tail.<ref name= Madge94/>

The Red-billed Chough's loud, ringing ''chee-ow'' call is clearer and louder than the similar vocalisation of the Jackdaw, and always very different from that of its yellow-billed [[congener]], which has rippling ''preep'' and whistled ''sweeeooo'' calls.<ref name= Madge94/> Small subspecies of the Red-billed Chough have higher frequency calls than larger races, as predicted by the inverse relationship between body size and frequency.<ref name= Laiolo2001 >{{cite journal ||last= Laiolo |first= Paola |coauthors= Rolando, Antonio; Delestrade, Anne; de Sanctis, Augusto |month= May |year=2001 |title= Geographical Variation in the Calls of the Choughs |journal= The Condor |volume=103 |issue=2 |pages=287<U+2013>297 | }}</ref> ({{audio|Choughcalls.ogg|Calls}})

==Behaviour==
The Red-billed Chough is not a colonial breeder, but is otherwise [[wikt:gregarious|gregarious]], feeding in flocks of up to 200 birds in areas where it is still sufficiently numerous, and roosting communally in caves at night (except nesting pairs). It often feeds with Alpine Choughs or Jackdaws, and like its closest relative can be inquisitive and tame.<ref name = Madge94/> It has a buoyant and easy flight and soars above the cliffs with spread [[Flight feather#Primaries| primary flight feathers]]; it often indulges in aerobatics, rolling, turning, and tail-chasing before sweeping upwards again.<ref name= Collins>Mullarney, Killian; Svensson, Lars, Zetterstrom, Dan; Grant, Peter. (2001). ''Birds of Europe.'' Princeton University Press. 334 ISBN 0691050546</ref>

===Feeding===
The Red-billed Chough's food consists largely of [[insect]]s, [[spider]]s and other [[invertebrate]]s taken from the ground, with [[ant]]s probably being the most significant item.<ref name = Madge94/> The Central Asian subspecies ''P. p. centralis'' will perch on the backs of wild or domesticated [[mammal]]s to feed on parasites.<ref name=Baletto>{{cite journal ||last= Baietto |first= Marco |coauthors= Masin, Simone; Vaghi, Serena; Padoa-Schioppa, Emilio |month= |year= 2007|title= [http://www.medwelljournals.com/fulltext/rjbs/2007/89-90.pdf Observation of Red-Billed Chough (''Pyrrhocorax pyrrhocorax'') Removing Fur from Himalayan Tahr (''Hemitragus jemlahicus'')] |format = PDF | journal= Research Journal of Biological Sciences |volume= 2|issue=1 |pages= 89<U+2013>90| }}</ref>  Although invertebrates make up most of the Chough's diet, it will eat vegetable matter including fallen grain, and in the Himalayas has been reported as damaging [[barley]] crops by breaking off the ripening heads to extract the corn.<ref name = Madge94/>

The preferred feeding habitat is short grass produced by grazing, for example by [[sheep]] and [[rabbit]]s, the numbers of which are linked to the Chough's breeding success. Suitable feeding areas can also arise where plant growth is hindered by exposure to coastal salt spray or poor soils.<ref name= Mccanch >{{cite journal ||last= Mccanch |first=Norman |month= November |year=2000 |title= The relationship between Red-Billed Chough ''Pyrrhocorax pyrrhocorax'' (L) breeding populations and grazing pressure on the Calf of Man |journal= Bird Study |volume= 47 |issue=3 |pages=295<U+2013>303 | }}</ref><ref name= Blanco4>{{cite journal ||last= Blanco |first= Guillermo |coauthors= Tella, Jos<U+00E9> Luis; Torre, Ignacio |month= July |year=1998 |title= Traditional farming and key foraging habitats for chough ''Pyrrhocorax pyrrhocorax'' conservation in a Spanish pseudosteppe landscape  |journal= Journal of Applied Ecology |volume=35 |issue=23 |pages= 232<U+2013>9| doi=10.1046/j.1365-2664.1998.00296.x | }}</ref>

Where the two chough species occur together, there is only limited competition for food. An Italian  study showed that the vegetable part of the winter diet for the Red-billed Chough was almost exclusively ''[[Gagea]]'' bulbs, whilst the Alpine Chough took berries and hips. In June, Red-billed Choughs  fed on [[Lepidoptera]] [[larva]]e whereas Alpine Choughs ate [[cranefly]] [[pupa]]e. Later in the summer, the Alpine Chough mainly consumed [[grasshopper]]s, whilst the Red-billed Chough added cranefly pupae, [[fly]] larvae and beetles to its diet.<ref name= Rolando2>{{cite journal ||last= Rolando |first= A |coauthors= Laiolo, P |month= April |year=1997 |title=

Red-billed Choughs can acquire blood parasites such as ''[[Plasmodium]]'', but a study in Spain showed that the prevalence was less than one percent, and unlikely to affect the life history and conservation of this species.<ref name= Blanco2>{{cite journal ||last= Blanco |first= Guillermo |coauthors= Merino, Santiago; Tella, Jose<U+00E9> Luis; Fargallo, Juan A; Gajon, A |month= |year=1997 |title= [http://www.jwildlifedis.org/cgi/reprint/33/3/642.pdf Hematozoa in two populations of the threatened red-billed chough in Spain] |journal= Journal of Wildlife Diseases |format = PDF | volume=33 |issue=33 |pages=642<U+2013>5 | }}</ref> These low levels of parasitism contrast with a much higher prevalence in some other passerine groups; for example a study of [[thrush (bird)|thrushes]] in [[Russia]] showed that ''all'' the [[Fieldfare]]s, [[Redwing]]s and [[Song Thrush]]es sampled carried haematozoans, particularly ''Haemoproteus''  and ''[[Trypanosoma]]''.<ref name=Markovets >{{cite journal ||last= Palinauskas |first= Vaidas  |coauthors = Markovets,  Mikhail Yu; Kosarev, Vladislav V; Efremov, Vladislav D; Sokolov Leonid V; Valki<U+00FB>nas, Gediminas |month= |year=2005 |title= Occurrence of avian haematozoa in Ekaterinburg

Red-billed Choughs can also carry [[mite]]s, but a study of the feather mite ''Gabucinia delibata'', acquired by young birds a few months after fledging when they join communal roosts, suggested that this parasite actually  ''improved'' the body condition of its host. It is possible that the feather mites enhance feather cleaning and deter [[pathogen]]s,<ref name= Blanco3>{{cite journal ||last= Blanco |first= Guillermo |coauthors= Tella, Jose Luis; Potti, Jaime |month= September |year=1997 |title= Feather Mites on Group-Living Red-Billed Choughs: A Non-Parasitic Interaction?  |journal= Journal of Avian Biology |volume=28 |issue=3 |pages= 197<U+2013>206| doi=10.2307/3676970| }}</ref> and may complement other feather care measures such as sunbathing, and rubbing the plumage with ants (the [[formic acid]] from the insects deters parasites).<ref name= Madge94/>

==Status==
The Red-billed Chough has an extensive range, estimated at 10&nbsp;million&nbsp;square kilometres (3.8&nbsp;million sq mi), and a large population, including an estimated 86,000 to 210,000 individuals in Europe. Over its range as a whole, the species is not believed to approach the thresholds for the global population decline criterion of the IUCN Red List (i.e., declining more than 30% in ten years or three generations), and is therefore evaluated as [[Least Concern]].<ref name =IUCN/>

However, the European range has declined and fragmented due to the loss of traditional pastoral farming, persecution and perhaps disturbance at breeding and nesting sites, although the numbers in [[France]], Great Britain and Ireland may now have stabilised.<ref name=BWP>{{cite book | last = Snow   | first =  David  |coauthors= Perrins, Christopher M  (editors)| title = The Birds of the Western Palearctic concise edition (2 volumes) | publisher = Oxford University Press |year = 1998| location =Oxford | isbn = 0-19-854099-X }} 1466<U+2013>68</ref> The European breeding population is between 12,265<U+2013>17,370 pairs, but only in Spain is the species still widespread. Since in the rest of the continent breeding areas are fragmented and isolated, the Red-billed Chough has been categorised as "vulnerable" in Europe.<ref name = JNCC>{{cite web|title= Chough ''Pyrrhocorax pyrrhocorax'' (breeding) |url= http://www.jncc.gov.uk/pdf/UKSPA/UKSPA-A6-102A.pdf|format = PDF |publisher= [[Joint Nature Conservation Committee]] |accessdate=2008-02-06}}</ref>

In Spain, the Red-billed Chough has recently expanded its range by utilising old buildings, with 1,175 breeding pairs in a 9,716 square kilometre (3,692 sq mi) study area. These new breeding areas usually surround the original montane core areas. However, the populations with building nest sites are threatened by human disturbance, persecution and the loss of old buildings.<ref name= Blanco5>{{cite journal ||last= Blanco |first= Guillermo |coauthors= Fargallo, Juan A.; Tella, Jos<U+00E9> Luis; Cuevas; Jes<U+00FA>s A. |month= February-March |year= 1997 |title= Role of buildings as nest-sites in the range expansion and conservation of choughs ''Pyrrhocorax pyrrhocorax'' in Spain |journal=Biological Conservation |volume= 79 |issue=2-3 |pages=117<U+2013>122 | doi:10.1016/S0006-3207(96)00118-8 |}}</ref>

In [[Greek mythology]], the Red-billed Chough, also known as 'sea-crow', was considered sacred to the [[Titan (mythology)|Titan]] [[Cronus]] and dwelt on [[Calypso (mythology)|Calypso's]] 'Blessed Island',<ref name="deVries76"/> where "The birds of broadest wing their mansions form/The chough, the sea-mew, the loquacious crow,"<ref name =Pope >{{cite web|title= Book V.

The Red-billed Chough has a long association with Cornwall, and appears on the Cornish [[Coat of arms|Coat of Arms]].<ref name = CCC2>{{cite web|title= The Cornwall County Council Coat of Arms|url=http://www.cornwall.gov.uk/index.cfm?articleid=13148 |publisher= Cornwall County Council |accessdate=2008-02-06}}</ref>  A legend from the county says that [[King Arthur]] did not die but was transformed into a Red-billed Chough,<ref name=Newlyn >{{cite book | last = Newlyn | first = Lucy | coauthors=Wilkinson, Lucy (illustrator) |title = Chatter of Choughs: An Anthology Celebrating the Return of Cornwall<U+2019>s Legendary Bird | year = 2005 | publisher = Hypatia Publications| pages = 31 |isbn = 1872229492}}</ref> and hence killing this bird was unlucky.<ref name="deVries76">{{cite book |last=de Vries |first=Ad |title=Dictionary of Symbols and Imagery |year=1976 |pages=p. 97|publisher=North-Holland Publishing Company |location=Amsterdam |isbn=0-7204-8021-3}}</ref>

Up to the eighteenth century, the Red-billed Chough was associated with fire-raising, and was described by [[William Camden]] as ''incendaria avis'', "oftentime  it secretly conveieth fire sticks, setting their houses afire".<ref name = Cocker/> [[Daniel Defoe]] was also familiar with this story:
<blockquote>It is counted little better than a kite, for it is of ravenous quality, and is very mischievous; it will steal and carry away any thing it finds about the house, that is not too heavy, tho' not fit for its food; as knives, forks, spoons and linnen cloths, or whatever it can fly away with, sometimes they say it has stolen bits of firebrands, or lighted candles, and lodged them in the stacks of corn, and the thatch of barns and houses, and set them on fire; but this I only had by oral tradition.<ref name= Defoe>{{cite book | last =Defoe | first = Daniel| title =A tour thro' the whole island of Great Britain, divided into circuits or journies ([http://vision.edina.ac.uk/text/chap_page.jsp?t_id=Defoe&c_id=12&p_id=478 Appendix To Letter III]) | year = 1724-7 |  isbn = }}</ref></blockquote>

Not all mentions of "chough" refer to this species.  Because  of the origins of its  name, when [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]] writes of "the crows and choughs that wing the midway air" [''[[King Lear]]'', act 4, scene 6] or [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]]'s Vermin Act of 1532 is "ordeyned to dystroye Choughes, Crowes and Rookes", they are clearly referring to the Jackdaw.<ref name = Cocker/>

In  heraldry, Choughs are  known  as "beckits" and three were depicted on the coat of arms of Archbishop [[Thomas Becket]].<ref name = Becket>{{cite web|title= Keeping the Twelve Days of Christmas |url= http://fullhomelydivinity.org/articles/Twelve%20Days%20of%20Christmas.htm |publisher= Fullhomelydivinity.org |accessdate=2008-02-06}}</ref> Due to its connection to the saint, the city of [[Canterbury]] also has Red-billed Choughs on its coats of arms.<ref name = Canterbury>{{cite web|title=The City Arms of Canterbury |url=http://www.canterbury.gov.uk/buildpage.php?id=217 |publisher= Canterbury City Council |accessdate=2008-02-06}}</ref> This species has  been depicted on the stamps of [[Bhutan]], [[The Gambia]], the [[Isle of Man]], [[Turkmenistan]] and [[Yugoslavia]].<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.birdtheme.org/scripts/family.php?famnum=187&page=2 |title=Crows, Jays and Magpies Corvidae  |accessdate=2008-03-31 |author=Scharning K |date=2008 |work=Theme Birds on Stamps |}}</ref>
