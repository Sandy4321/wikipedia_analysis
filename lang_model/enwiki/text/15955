==Guardian Films==

n its first three years, her company made 30 films &ndash; mostly for television &ndash; including the ''Baghdad Blogger'' reports, featuring Baghdad resident '' '[[Salam Pax]]' '' &ndash; whose blog ''Where is Raed?'' was printed in ''[[The Guardian]]'' and ''[[New York Times]]'' during the occupation of his city &ndash. They were shown on [[BBC Two]]'s ''[[Newsnight]]'' programme. Some of these were also shown in 2007 in two collections by ''[[CNN]] International''. 

Kane was also reporter in ''Sex On The Streets'', made by ''GuardianFilms'' for the [[United Kingdom|UK]]'s [[Channel 4]] television & it focused on violence against women working as prostitutes. "Even their deaths often pass unmarked, and they make up the largest single group of unsolved murders in Britain," said O'Kane.<ref>[http://www.guardian.co.uk/guardianfilms/story/0,,1648981,00.html/ ''Sex On The Streets'', Guardian Unlimited] Retrieved on [[2007-07-19]].</ref> O'Kane was also reporter in the company's ''Spiked'' &ndash; again made for Channel 4 TV &ndash about the use 'date rape' drugs. In the first half of 2007 alone, ''GuardianFilms'' won two Amnesty International awards and a [[Royal Television Society|RTS]] award for its Iraq coverage.

' ''GuardianFilms'' was born in a sleeping bag in the Burmese rainforest,' she wrote in 2003.<ref>[http://www.buzzle.com/editorials/11-7-2003-47360.asp/ ''Maggie O'Kane: Bringing the Guardian's Ethos to TV, ''Buzzle.com'', 11 July 2003].Retrieved on [[2007-07-19]].</ref> 'I was a foreign correspondent for the paper, and it had taken me weeks of negotiations, dealing with shady contacts and a lot of walking to reach the cigar-smoking Karen twins - the boy soldiers who were leading attacks against the country's ruling junta. After I had reached them and written a cover story for the newspaper's ''G2'' section, I got a call from the [[BBC]]'s documentary department, which was researching a film on child soldiers. Could I give them all my contacts? 

'The plight of the Karen people, who were forced into slave labour in the rainforest to build pipelines for oil companies (some of them British), was a tale of human suffering that needed to be told by any branch of the media that was interested. I handed over all the names and numbers I had, as well as details of the secret route through Thailand to get into Burma. Good girl. 

'Afterwards - and not for the first time &ndash; it seemed to me that we at the ''[[The Guardian|Guardian]]'' should be using our resources ourselves. Instead of providing contact numbers for any independent TV company prepared to get on the phone to a journalist, we should make our own films.'
