'''Lenore Malen''' is an American artist whose practice involves video installation, photography, and performance. Malen was awarded a [[Guggenheim fellowship]] and a [[New York Foundation for the Arts|NYFA]] Grant in Interdisciplinary Art in 2009.

==Early Life and Career==
Malen was born, lives and works in New York City. Malen's father, Philip J. Levitt, was a music critic and several uncles were artists, including the printmaker Edwin Kaufman and the [[Works Projects Administration]] painter Lionel Stern. Malen received a BA from [[Skidmore College]] in art history, and an MA in art history from the [[University of Pennsylvania]] (1972). She began her career as a minimalist painter, curator and art critic, exhibiting at the [[Aldrich Contemporary Art Museum]] and writing for [[Arts Magazine]] under the editorship of [[Richard Martin (curator)|Richard Martin]]. She continued to exhibit in the US and Europe through the 1980s. From l990-1996, Malen was executive editor of ''[http://artjournal.collegeart.org/?p=54 Art Journal]'', published by the [[College Art Association]].  She is the only artist to have ever served in this position.

==Artwork Since 1998==
Beginning in l998, Malen<U+2019>s interest in games inspired a series of site-specific works and [[Artist's book|artists' books]] that engaged the viewer as a direct participant. Her book ''Opportunity Knocks'' (1998), produced to coincide with an exhibition at [[Rutgers University]], was described by critic Nancy Princenthal in [[Art on Paper]] (l998) as having a <U+201C>distinctive blend of urgency and fatalism played for laughs.<U+201D><ref>Nancy Princenthal. "Artists' Book Beat." ''Art on Paper''. September l998.</ref> Other game-based projects include [http://www.artingeneral.org/exhibitions/339 "Magnetic Map"] (1999), created for [[Art in General]] New York, "The Lottery" (1999), an exhibition she curated for Rotunda in Brooklyn, and illustrated short stories for [http://france-fiction.net/ France-Fiction], Paris.

===The New Society for Universal Harmony===

In 1999 Malen began work on her ongoing project ''The New Society for Universal Harmony'', a fictive reinvention of ''La Soci<U+00E9>t<U+00E9> de l'harmonie universelle,'' founded by [[Franz Mesmer]] in Paris in l784. ''The New Society for Universal Harmony'' uses pseudo-documentary photos, video and audio transcriptions, testimonials, case histories and other devices drawn from historical reenactment, to archive the functioning of Malen<U+2019>s reinvention of the Mesmer's 18th century utopian society. The book's black and white photographs  a range of influences <U+2013> from the [[Kinsey Institute]]'s archives, stills from [[Peter Weiss]]'s 1967 theatrical production and film ''[[Marat/Sade]]'' and photographs by 19th-century French anatomist Guillaume-Benjamin-Amand [[Duchenne de Boulogne]], to the photographs of the l9th-century photographer [[Carleton Watkins]]. ''The New Society'' also functions as an actual society of artists and actors who, while they perform reenactments and rituals, document these activities together as artworks. Since l999, all of Malen collaborative projects have been produced by ''The New Society'' as they continue to explore utopian themes.

===Recognition for ''The New Society''===
''The New Society'' has been exhibited widely in the US and internationally, and featured in numerous publications and on television. In Fall 2002, the writer [[Jonathan Ames]] wrote a short story for [[Bomb (magazine)|BOMB Magazine]]<ref name="My New Society Testimony: Able to Love Again">Jonathan Ames. "My New Society Testimony: Able to Love Again." ''BOMB Magazine''. [http://bombsite.com/issues/81/articles/2507] Accessed August 18, 2013.</ref> about his visit to ''The New Society''. In 2005, Malen performed for the [[BBC]] as Doctor Mesmer in Miriam Margolyes's television production [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etcPJmvHNAQ ''Dickens in America'']. In 2005 Malen's book, eponymously titled ''[http://www.granarybooks.com/book/100/Lenore_Malen+The_New_Society_for_Universal_Harmony/ The New Society for Universal Harmony]'', was published by Granary Books.

In February 2006 the writer [[Gary Indiana]] wrote in [[Art in America]]:
 <blockquote>
Lenore Malen<U+2019>s multi-media project ''The New Society for Universal Harmony'' simulates the spell of utopian yearning (and its familiar decay into authoritarianism ideology) in a slyly deflationary paradigm of illness and healing, expanded outward from individual malaise and cure to an idealized therapeutic communitarianism. Malen<U+2019>s model utopia is an elaborately woven fiction<U+2014>a restaging in photographs, videos and texts of the <U+201C>magnetic healing practices<U+201D> in the years leading up to the French Revolution by Franz Anton Mesmer.
</blockquote>

===Harmony As a Hive/I Am the Animal===

Following a live performance at the CUE Art Foundation (2007), which examined the social structure of the beehive as a model of utopia, Malen began raising bees in Hudson NY. In 2009 she produced and directed ''I Am The Animal, Part I'', a 22-minute documentary on beekeepers in the Hudson Valley, New York. Subsequently, Malen broadened her focus to an exploration of the philosophical differences and exclusions between animals and humans. A later work ''I Am The Animal, Part II'', a three-channel immersive video installation, attempts a reverse anthropomorphism, re-imagining human culture as a hive through the co-mingling of historic, documentary and mass-media footage. It was installed at the Mediations Biennale in Poznan, Poland (2012), [[Tufts University]] Art Gallery, Medford, MA (2011), and [[Wave Hill]], NY (2010).

The Finnish media theorist Jussi Parrika  described the work in ''Angelaki Journal of Theoretical Humanities'' as "a progressing multiplication of viewpoints, immersive space, slow disorientation that points to the world of insects and to the media in which we are immersed. The three screens deterritorialized our vision."  Currently ''The New Society'' is beginning production on an installation and performance inspired by a 15th-century manuscript illumination of Genesis 2 titled ''Don't Go Through That Door: An Ecological Burlesque''. The work will be completed in 2014-5.

==Teaching, Residencies, Fellowships==
Malen is an Associate Teaching Professor in the MFA Fine Arts Program at [[Parsons School of Design|Parsons The New School For Design]], where she has taught since l991. She has previously taught at [[RISD]], [[Cooper Union]], [[Bennington College]] and the [[University of Pennsylvania]]. Between 1990 and 2003 Malen was awarded residences at [[Yaddo]], New York, Blue Mountain Center, New York, and held a Hand Hollow Foundation Fellowship at the [[Fine Arts Work Center]] in Provincetown, Massachusetts (1998).  She was a visiting artist at the [[Vermont Studio Center]] in 1997, and a Senior Fellow at the Terra Foundation, Giverny, France in 2001. Malen was awarded a Guggenheim Foundation Fellow and a NYFA Grant in Interdiscplinary Art in 2009.
