[[File:041009 Schiehallion 01.jpg|right|thumb|240px|Schiehallion's isolated position and symmetrical shape lent themselves well to the experiment]]
The '''Schiehallion experiment''' was an eighteenth-century experiment to determine the mean [[density]] of the [[Earth]]. Funded by a grant from the [[Royal Society]], it was conducted in the summer of 1774 around the Scottish mountain of [[Schiehallion]], [[Perthshire]]. The experiment involved measuring the tiny deflection of a [[pendulum]] due to the [[gravity|gravitational attraction]] of a nearby mountain. Schiehallion was considered the ideal location after a nation-wide search for candidate mountains, thanks to its isolation and almost symmetrical shape.

The experiment had previously been considered, but rejected, by [[Isaac Newton]] as a practical demonstration of his [[Newton's law of universal gravitation|theory of gravitation]]. However, a team of scientists, notably [[Nevil Maskelyne]], the [[Astronomer Royal]], were convinced that the effect would be detectable and undertook to conduct the experiment. The deflection angle depended on the relative densities and volumes of the Earth and the mountain: if the density and volume of Schiehallion could be ascertained, then so could the density of the Earth. Once this was known, then this would in turn would yield approximate values for those of the other planets, their [[natural satellites|moons]], and the [[Sun]], previously known only in terms of their relative ratios. As an additional benefit, the experiment provided [[cartography|cartographers]] with [[contour line]]s, devised to simplify the process of surveying the mountain.

==Background==
A [[pendulum]] hangs straight downwards in a symmetrical [[gravitational field]]. However, if a sufficiently large mass such as a mountain is nearby, its gravitational attraction should pull the pendulum's [[plumb-bob]] slightly out of true. The change in plumb-line angle against a known object&mdash;such as a star&mdash;could be carefully measured on opposite sides of the mountain. If the mass of the mountain could be independently established from a determination of its [[volume]] and an estimate of the mean [[density]] of its rocks, then these values could be extrapolated to provide the mean density of the Earth, and by extension, its mass.

[[Isaac Newton]] had considered the effect in the ''[[Philosophi<U+00E6> Naturalis Principia Mathematica|Principia]]'', but pessimistically thought that any real mountain would produce too small a deflection to measure.<ref name=Principia>{{cite book |last=Newton|title=Philosophi<U+00E6> Naturalis Principia Mathematica |volume=II |page=528 |url=http://scanserver.ulib.org/is/scanserver/newton/xml/doc.scn?pg=527&rp=_n}} Translated: Andrew Motte, First American Edition. New York, 1846</ref> Gravitational effects, he wrote, were only discernible on the planetary scale.<ref name=Principia/> Newton's pessimism was unfounded: although his calculations had suggested a deviation of less than 2&nbsp;[[minute of arc|minutes of arc]] (for an idealised three-mile high mountain), this angle, though very slight, was well within the theoretical capability of instruments of his day.<ref name="Sillitto">{{cite web|url=http://www.sillittopages.co.uk/schie/schie90.html|title=Maskelyne on Schiehallion: A Lecture to the The Royal Philosophical Society of Glasgow |last=Sillitto|first=R.M.|date=31 October 1990 |accessdate=28 December 2008}}</ref>

An experiment to test Newton's idea would both provide supporting evidence for his [[Newton's law of universal gravitation|law of universal gravitation]], and estimates of the mass and density of the Earth. Since the masses of astronomical objects were known only in terms of relative ratios, the mass of the Earth would provide reasonable values to the other [[planet]]s, their [[Natural satellite|moons]], and the [[Sun]]. The data was also capable of determining the value of [[Gravitational constant|Newton's gravitational constant]] ''G'', though this was not a goal of the experimenters; references to a value for ''G'' would not appear in the scientific literature until almost a hundred years later.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Cornu|first=A.|coauthors=Baille, J.

=== Chimborazo, 1738 ===
A pair of French astronomers named [[Pierre Bouguer]] and [[Charles Marie de La Condamine]] were the first to attempt the experiment, conducting their measurements on the {{convert|6268|m|ft|adj=on}} volcano [[Chimborazo]] in [[Ecuador]] in 1738.<ref name="Poynting_p50-56">{{cite book|last=Poynting|first=J.H.|title=The Earth: its shape, size, weight and spin|publisher=Cambridge|date=1913 |pages=50&ndash;56 |url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=whA9AAAAIAAJ&pg=PA50}}</ref> Their expedition had left France for South America in 1735 to try to measure the length of a degree of the [[Meridian (geography)|meridian]] near the [[equator]], but they took advantage of the opportunity to attempt the deflection experiment. In December 1738, under very difficult conditions of terrain and climate, they conducted a pair of measurements at altitudes of 4,680 and 4,340&nbsp;m.<ref name="Poynting_1894">{{cite book|last=Poynting|first=J.

=== Schiehallion, 1774 ===
[[File:Loch Rannoch.jpg|thumb|left|180px|The symmetrical ridge of Schiehallion viewed across [[Loch Rannoch]]]]
That a further attempt should be made on the experiment was proposed to the [[Royal Society]] in 1772 by [[Nevil Maskelyne]], [[Astronomer Royal]].<ref>{{cite journal|last=Maskelyne|first=N.|date=1772|title=A proposal for measuring the attraction of some hill in this Kingdom |journal=Phil. Trans. Royal Soc.|volume=65|pages=495&ndash;499 |url=http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1775RSPT...65..495M}}</ref> He suggested that the experiment would "do honour to the nation where it was made"<ref name="Sillitto"/> and proposed [[Whernside]] in [[Yorkshire]], or the [[Helvellyn]]-[[Skiddaw]] massif in [[Cumberland]] as suitable targets. The Royal Society formed the Committee of Attraction to consider the matter, appointing Maskelyne, [[Joseph Banks]] and [[Benjamin Franklin]] amongst its members.<ref name="Danson_p115">{{cite book|last=Danson|first=Edwin |title=Weighing the World |publisher=Oxford University Press|date=2006|pages=115&ndash;116|isbn=978-0195181692|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=UNH_Y7ERFeoC&pg=PA146}}</ref> The Committee despatched the astronomer and surveyor [[Charles Mason]]{{Ref_label|A|a|none}} to find a suitable mountain.

After a lengthy search, Mason reported that the best candidate was [[Schiehallion]] (then spelled ''Schehallien''), a {{convert|1083|m|ft|abbrv=on|adj=on}} peak lying between [[Loch Tay]] and [[Loch Rannoch]] in the central [[Scottish Highlands]].<ref name="Danson_p115" /> The mountain stood in isolation from any nearby hills, which would reduce their gravitational influence, and its symmetrical east-west ridge would simplify the calculations. Its steep northern and southern slopes would allow the experiment to be sited close to its [[centre of gravity]], maximising the deflection effect.

Mason however declined to conduct the work himself for the offered commission of one [[Guinea (British coin)|guinea]] per day.<ref name="Danson_p115" /> The task therefore fell to Maskelyne, for which he was granted a temporary leave of his duties as Astronomer Royal. He was aided in the task by mathematician and surveyor [[Charles Hutton]] and [[Reuben Borrow]], a mathematician of the [[Royal Greenwich Observatory]]. A workforce of labourers was engaged to construct observatories for the astronomers, and assist in the surveying. The science team was particularly well-equipped: its astronomical instruments included a {{convert|12|in|cm|abbrv=on|adj=on}} brass [[quadrant (instrument)|quadrant]] from [[First voyage of James Cook|Cook's 1769 transit of Venus expedition]], a {{convert|10|ft|m|adj=on|abbrv=on}} [[zenith]] sector, and a regulator (precision [[pendulum clock]]) for timing the astronomical observations.<ref name="Danson_p146">{{cite book|last=Danson|first=Edwin |title=Weighing the World |publisher=Oxford University Press|date=2006|page=146|isbn=978-0195181692|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=UNH_Y7ERFeoC&pg=PA146}}</ref> They also acquired a [[theodolite]] and [[Gunter's chain]] for surveying the mountain, and a pair of [[barometer]]s for measuring altitude.<ref name="Danson_p146" /> Generous funding for the experiment was available due to underspend on the [[transit of Venus]] expedition.<ref name="Sillitto" />

[[File:Schiehallion angles.svg|right|300px|thumb|The deflection is the difference between the true [[zenith]] ''Z'' as determined by [[astrometry]], and the apparent zenith ''Z''<nowiki>'</nowiki> as determined by a [[plumb-line]]]]
Observatories were constructed to the north and south of the mountain, plus a [[bothy]] to accommodate equipment and the scientists.<ref name="Poynting_1894"/>{{Ref_label|B|b|none}} Most of the workforce was however housed in rough canvas tents. Maskelyne's astronomical measurements were the first to be conducted. It was necessary for him to determine the [[zenith distance]]s with respect to the plumb line for a set of stars at the precise time that each passed due south.<ref name="Sillitto" /><ref name="countingthoughts">{{cite web|url=http://www.countingthoughts.com/ct/wtw/notes.pdf|title=The <U+201C>Weigh the World<U+201D> Challenge 2005|date=23 April 2005|publisher=countingthoughts|accessdate=28 December 2008}}</ref><ref name="Poynting_p56-59">{{cite book|last=Poynting|first=J.H.|title=The Earth: its shape, size, weight and spin|publisher=Cambridge|date=1913|pages=56&ndash;59|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=whA9AAAAIAAJ&pg=PA50}}</ref> Weather conditions were frequently unfavourable due to mist and rain. However, from the south observatory, he was able to take 76 measurements on 34 stars in one direction, and then 93 observations on 39 stars in the other. From the north side, he then conducted a set of 68 observations on 32 stars and a set of 100 on 37 stars.<ref name="Poynting_1894" />

To determine the deflection due to the mountain, it was necessary to account for the curvature of the Earth: an observer will see the local [[zenith]] shift by the same angle as any change in [[latitude]]. After also accounting for observational effects such as [[precession]], [[aberration of light]] and  [[nutation]], Maskelyne showed that the difference between the locally-determined zenith for observers north and south of Schiehallion was 54.6&nbsp;arc seconds.<ref name="Poynting_1894" /> Once the surveying team had provided a difference of 42.94" latitude between the two stations, he was able to subtract this, and after rounding to the accuracy of his observations, announce that the deflection due to the mountain was 11.6".<ref name="Sillitto" /><ref name="countingthoughts" /><ref name="Poynting_1894" />

Maskelyne published his initial results in the ''[[Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society]]'' in 1775,<ref>{{cite journal|last=Maskelyne |first=N.|date=1775|title=An Account of Observations Made on the Mountain Schiehallion for Finding Its Attraction|journal=Phil. Trans. Royal Soc.|volume=65|pages=500&ndash;542}}</ref> using preliminary data on its shape and hence the position of its [[center of mass|center of gravity]]. This led him to expect a deflection of 20.9" if the mean densities of Schiehallion and the Earth were equal.<ref name="Sillitto" /> Since the deflection was about 5/9 of this, he was able to make a preliminary announcement that the mean density of the Earth was 9/5 that of Schiehallion. Using an estimate of {{nowrap begin}}2,500&nbsp;kg<U+00B7>m<sup>&minus;3</sup>{{nowrap end}} for Schiehallion's density, he calculated a mean Earth density of {{nowrap begin}}4,500&nbsp;kg<U+00B7>m<sup>&minus;3</sup>{{nowrap end}}.<ref name="text-book">{{cite book|last=Poynting|first=J.

Maskelyne took the opportunity to note that that Schiehallion exhibited a gravitational attraction, and thus all mountains did; and that Newton's inverse square law of gravitation had been confirmed.<ref name="Mackenzie">{{cite book|last=Mackenzie|first=A.S.|title=The laws of gravitation; memoirs by Newton, Bouguer and Cavendish, together with abstracts of other important memoirs|date=1900|pages=53&ndash;56|url=http://www.archive.org/download/lawsofgravitatio00mackrich/lawsofgravitatio00mackrich.pdf}}</ref> An appreciative Royal Society presented Maskelyne with the 1775 [[Copley Medal]]; the biographer [[Alexander Chalmers|Chalmers]] later noting that "If any doubts yet remained with respect to the truth of the Newtonian system, they were now totally removed".<ref>{{cite book|last=Chalmers|first=A.|title=The General Biographical Dictionary|date=1816|volume=25|page=317|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=Uh8IAAAAQAAJ&pg=PA317}}</ref>

The work of the surveying team was greatly hampered by the inclemency of the weather, and it took until 1776 to complete the task.<ref name="text-book"/> To find the volume of the mountain, it was necessary to divide it into a set of vertical [[prism]]s and compute the volume of each. The [[triangulation]] task falling to Charles Hutton was considerable: the surveyors had obtained thousands of bearings to more than a thousand points around the mountain.<ref name="Danson_p153">{{cite book|last=Danson|first=Edwin |title=Weighing the World |publisher=Oxford University Press|date=2006|page=153|isbn=978-0195181692|url=http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=UNH_Y7ERFeoC&oi=fnd&pg=PA153}}</ref> Moreover, the vertices of his prisms did not always conveniently coincide with the surveyed heights. To make sense of all his data, he hit upon the idea of [[interpolation|interpolating]] a series of lines at set intervals between his measure values, marking points of equal height. In doing so, not only could he easily determine the heights of his prisms, but from the swirl of the lines one could get an instant impression of the form of the terrain. Hutton had invented [[contour line]]s, in common use since for [[Cartographic relief depiction|depicting cartographic relief]].<ref name="Poynting_1894"/><ref name="Danson_p153"/>{{Ref_label|C|c|none}}

Hutton presented his work in a paper read to the Royal Society in 1778.<ref name="Hutton">{{cite journal|last=Hutton|first=C. |date=1778 |title=An Account of the Calculations Made from the Survey and Measures Taken at Schehallien |journal=Phil.

That the mean density of the Earth should so greatly exceed that of its surface rocks naturally meant that there must be more dense material lying deeper. Hutton correctly surmised that the core material was likely metallic, and might have a density of {{nowrap begin}}10,000&nbsp;kg<U+00B7>m<sup>&minus;3</sup>{{nowrap end}}. He estimated this metallic portion to occupy some 65% of the diameter of the Earth.<ref name="Hutton"/> With a value for the mean density of the Earth, Hutton was able to set some values to [[J<U+00E9>r<U+00F4>me Lalande]]'s planetary tables, which had previously only been able to express the densities of the major solar system objects in relative terms.

== Repeat experiments ==
[[John Playfair]] carried out a second survey of Schiehallion in 1811; on the basis of a rethink of its rock strata, he suggested a density of 4,560 to {{nowrap begin}}4,870&nbsp;kg<U+00B7>m<sup>&minus;3</sup>{{nowrap end}},<ref name="Ranalli">{{cite journal|last=Ranalli|first=G.|date=1984|title=An Early Geophysical Estimate of the Mean Density of the Earth: Schehallien, 1774 |journal=Earth Sciences History|volume=3|issue=2|pages=149&ndash;152|url=http://hess.metapress.com/content/k43q522gtt440172/}}</ref> though the then elderly Hutton vigorously defended the original value.<ref name="Sillitto" /> Playfair's calculations had raised the density closer towards its modern value, but was still too low and significantly poorer than [[Henry Cavendish|Cavendish]]'s computation of some years earlier.

[[File:Edinburgh Arthur Seat dsc06165.jpg|thumb|left|240px|[[Arthur's Seat, Edinburgh]], the site of Henry James' 1856 experiment]]
The Schiehallion experiment was repeated in 1856 by [[Henry James (Ordnance Survey)|Henry James]], director-general of the [[Ordnance Survey]], who instead used the mountain of [[Arthur's Seat, Edinburgh|Arthur's Seat]] in central [[Edinburgh]].<ref name="Poynting_1894" /><ref name="Poynting_p56-59"/><ref>{{cite journal|last=James|date=1856|title=On the Deflection of the Plumb-Line at Arthur's Seat, and the Mean Specific Gravity of the Earth|journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society|url=http://www.jstor.org/pss/108603}}</ref> With the resources of the Ordnance Survey at his disposal, James extended his topographical survey to a 21-kilometre radius, taking him as far as the borders of [[Edinburghshire]]. He obtained a density of about {{nowrap begin}}5,300&nbsp;kg<U+00B7>m<sup>&minus;3</sup>{{nowrap end}}.<ref name="Sillitto" /><ref name="text-book" />

An experiment in 2005 undertook a variation of the 1774 work: instead of computing local differences in the zenith, the experiment made a very accurate comparison of the period of a pendulum at the top and bottom of Schiehallion. The period of a pendulum is a function of ''[[g-force|g]]'', the local [[gravitational acceleration]]. The pendulum is expected to run more slowly at altitude, but the mass of the mountain will act to reduce this difference. This experiment has the advantage of being considerably easier to conduct than the 1774 one, but to achieve the desired accuracy, it is necessary to measure the period of the pendulum to within one part in one million.<ref name="countingthoughts" /> This experiment yielded a value of the mass of the Earth of {{nowrap begin}}8.1<U+00B1>2.4&times;10<sup>24</sup>&nbsp;kg{{nowrap end}},<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.countingthoughts.com/ct/wtw/schiehallion%20results%20june.doc|title=The <U+201C>Weigh the World<U+201D> Challenge Results | publisher=countingthoughts |accessdate=28 December 2008}}</ref> corresponding to a mean density of {{nowrap begin}}7,500<U+00B1>1,900&nbsp;kg<U+00B7>m<sup>&minus;3</sup>{{nowrap end}}.{{Ref_label|D|d|none}} 

A modern re-examination of the geophysical data was able to take account of factors the 1774 team could not.

===Cavendish experiment===
{{main|Cavendish experiment}}
A more direct, and more accurate, measurement of the mean density of the Earth was made 24 years after Schiehallion, when in 1798 [[Henry Cavendish]] used an exquisitely sensitive [[torsion balance]] to measure the attraction between large masses of [[lead]]. Cavendish's figure of {{nowrap begin}}5,450&nbsp;kg<U+00B7>m<sup>&minus;3</sup>{{nowrap end}} was little more than 1% from the currently accepted value, and his result would not be significantly improved upon until 1895 by [[C. V. Boys|Charles Boys]].

== Mathematical procedure ==
[[File:Schiehallion.svg|right|thumb|300px|Schiehallion [[force diagram]]]]
Consider the [[force diagram]] to the right, in which the deflection has been greatly exaggerated.<ref name="Ranalli" /> A plumb-bob of mass ''m'' is situated a distance ''d'' from ''P'', the [[centre of gravity]] of a mountain of mass ''M<sub>M</sub>'' and [[density]] ''<U+03C1><sub>M</sub>''. It is deflected through a small angle ''<U+03B8>'' due to its attraction ''F'' towards ''P'' and its [[weight]] ''W'' directed towards the Earth. The [[vector sum]] of ''W'' and ''F'' result in a [[Tension (physics)|tension]] ''T'' in the pendulum string. The Earth has a mass ''M<sub>E</sub>'', radius ''r<sub>E</sub>'' and a density ''<U+03C1><sub>E</sub>''.

The two gravitational forces on the plumb-bob are given by [[Newton's law of gravitation]]:

:<math>
F = \frac {G m M_M} {d^2} ,\quad W = \frac {G m M_E} {r_E^2}
</math>

Where ''G'' is [[Gravitational constant|Newton's gravitational constant]]. ''G'' and ''m'' can be eliminated by taking the ratio of ''F'' to ''W'':

:<math>
\frac {F} {W} 
= \frac {(G m M_M) / d^2} {(G m M_E) / r_E^2} 
= \frac {M_M}{M_E} {\left( \frac {r_E}{d} \right)}^2
= \frac {\rho_M} {\rho_E} \frac {V_M} {V_E} {\left( \frac {r_E}{d} \right)}^2
</math>

Where ''V<sub>M</sub>'' and ''V<sub>E</sub>'' are the volumes of the mountain and the Earth. Under [[static equilibrium]], the horizontal and vertical components of the string tension ''T'' can be related to the gravitational forces and the deflection angle ''<U+03B8>'':

:<math>
W = T \cos \theta ,\quad F = T \sin \theta
</math>

Substituting for ''T'':

:<math>
\tan \theta
= \frac {F} {W} 
= \frac {\rho_M}{\rho_E} \frac {V_M}{V_E}  {\left( \frac {r_E}{d} \right)}^2
</math>

Since ''V<sub>E</sub>'', ''V<sub>M</sub>'', ''d'' and ''r<sub>E</sub>'' are all known, and ''<U+03B8>'' has been measured, then a value for the ratio ''<U+03C1><sub>E</sub>''&nbsp;:&nbsp;''<U+03C1><sub>M</sub>'' can be obtained.

Maskelyne measured ''<U+03B8>''&nbsp;=&nbsp;11.6", giving tan&nbsp;''<U+03B8>''&nbsp;=&nbsp;1/17,781.<ref name="Poynting_1894" /> After factoring for the [[Earth's_gravity#Latitude|effects of latitude and altitude on Earth's gravity]], and using an Earth radius of 6368.647&nbsp;km, he calculated an Earth:Schiehallion density ratio of 1.8:1.<ref name="Ranalli" />
