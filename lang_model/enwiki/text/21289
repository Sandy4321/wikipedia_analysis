The '''''Forgotten Realms''''' is a [[campaign setting]] for the ''[[Dungeons & Dragons]]'' (D&D) [[fantasy]] [[role-playing game]], created by Canadian author and game designer [[Ed Greenwood]]. Commonly referred to as simply "The Realms", it is one of the most popular D&D settings,<ref>{{cite news | first=Matt | last=Slagle | title='Neverwinter Nights' sequel brings more dungeon exploration to PC | date=2007-01-18 | publisher=[[Deseret News]] | url =http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4188/is_20070118/ai_n17153575 | work =[[Associated Press]] | accessdate = 2008-12-04 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news | first=Desslock | title='Neverwinter Nights' sequel brings more dungeon exploration to PC | date=1999-01-20 | url =http://reviews.cnet.com/pc-games/baldur-s-gate-pc/4505-9696_7-30975286.html | work =[[CNET Networks]] | accessdate = 2008-12-04 }}</ref> brought about largely due to the success of novels by authors such as [[R. A. Salvatore]] and numerous [[computer role-playing game]]s such as ''[[Pool of Radiance]]'', ''[[Baldur's Gate series|Baldur's Gate]]'', and ''[[Neverwinter Nights]]''. The primary focus of the setting is the [[continent]] of [[Faer<U+00FB>n]], part of the world of [[Abeir-Toril]], an [[Earth]]-like planet with many real world influences.

According to the creators, it is the name of an imaginary fantasy world that exists somewhere beyond our own world. It is a world of strange lands, dangerous creatures, and mighty deities, where magic and seemingly supernatural phenomena are quite real. Unlike our world, the lands of the Forgotten Realms are not all ruled by the human race: the planet [[Abeir-Toril]] is shared by humans, dwarves, elves, goblins, orcs, and other, more or less strange peoples and creatures. Technologically, the world of the Forgotten Realms isn't nearly as advanced as ours; in this respect, it resembles the earth in the 13th or 14th century.

Ostensibly, once upon a time, our Earth and the world of Forgotten Realms were somehow more closely connected. As time passed, we, the inhabitants of planet Earth, have mostly forgotten about the existence of that other world -- hence the term "Forgotten Realms". In the original Forgotten Realms logo, the little runic letters in it read "Herein lie the lost lands". This is another allusion to this connection between the two worlds.

However, in spite of this connection, the world of the Forgotten Realms is in many ways nothing like our world. On the planet [[Abeir-Toril]], the dead sometimes choose to walk among the living, gods meddle with mortal matters, a desert seems to have a mind of its own, dragons are always a very real threat, and no tale can be too strange to be true. Many wondrous kingdoms and events of the past have been long forgotten, and with every passing year new mysteries arise. In the Forgotten Realms, survival itself can be an epic adventure. It is currently one of only two campaign settings, along with [[Eberron]], for which official ''Dungeons & Dragons'' publisher [[Wizards of the Coast]] is still creating new material.

==History==
[[Image:FRCS-1ED.jpg|thumb|left|150px|The original 1987 edition of the ''Forgotten Realms Campaign Set'']]
===Initial release===
In 1967, an 8-year-old [[Canadian]] boy wrote the following lines: "Now in all the lands 'twixt bustling Waterdeep and the sparkling waves of The Sea of Fallen Stars, no men were more loved -- and feared -- than the stoic swordsman Durnan, the blustering old rogue Mirt, and the all-wise, ancient wizard [[Elminster]]."<ref>''[[Dragon (magazine)|Dragon]] issue #218, page 8.</ref>

These were the very first words written about the Forgotten Realms and that boy was Ed Greenwood, who originally designed it and began writing little stories of his own about heroes adventuring in an imaginary world. When the ''[[Dungeons & Dragons]]'' game was introduced, the setting became the home of Greenwood's own personal campaign.<ref name="FRA">[[Jeff Grubb|Grubb, Jeff]] and [[Ed Greenwood]]. ''[[Forgotten Realms Adventures]]'' ([[TSR, Inc.|TSR]], 1990)</ref> A few years later, Greenwood began publishing a series of short articles detailing the setting in ''[[Dragon (magazine)|Dragon]]'' magazine, the first of which was about a monster known as the [[Curst (Forgotten Realms)|Curst]].<ref>[[Steve Winter|Winter, Steve]] and [[Ed Greenwood|Greenwood, Ed]].

Forgotten Realms novels, such as the ''[[Legacy of the Drow]]'' series, the first three books of ''[[The Elminster Series]]'', and numerous [[anthologies]], were also released throughout the decade, which lead to the setting being hailed as one of the most successful [[shared universe|shared fantasy universes]] of the 1990s.<ref>{{cite book| last=Oxoby| first=Marc| year=2003| title=The 1990s| publisher=[[Greenwood Publishing Group]]| isbn=9780313316159}}</ref>

Several popular ''Forgotten Realms'' characters such as [[Drizzt Do'Urden]] and [[Elminster]] made minor appearances in these games.

With the release of the 3rd edition ''Dungeons & Dragons'' rules system in 2000 by [[Wizards of the Coast]], the ''Forgotten Realms Campaign Setting'' was revised again, in 2001, updating the official material and advancing the timeline of the game world.<ref name=FRCS3rd /> In 2002, this revision ''Forgotten Realms Campaign Setting'' won the [[Origins Award]] for ''Best Role-Playing Game Supplement of 2001''.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.originsgamefair.com/awards/2001|title= 2001 List of Winners|accessdate=9 December 2008 |publisher= Academy of Adventure Gaming, Arts & Design}}</ref>

==The world==
{{main|Faer<U+00FB>n}}
===Geography===
The planet of [[Abeir-Toril]] consists of several large [[continent]]s, including [[Faer<U+00FB>n]], the focus of the setting, which was first detailed in the original ''Forgotten Realms Campaign Set'', published in 1987 by [[TSR, Inc.|TSR]].<ref name="FRCS1st" /> The other continents include [[Kara-Tur]], [[Zakhara]], [[Maztica]], and other yet unspecified landmasses. Kara-Tur, roughly corresponding to ancient East [[Asia]], was later the focus of its own source book ''Kara-Tur: The Eastern Realms'', published in 1988.<ref>{{cite book| last=Pondsmith| first=Mike| authorlink=Mike Pondsmith| coauthors=Jay Batista, Rick Swan| year=1988| title=Kara-Tur: The Eastern Realms| publisher=[[TSR, Inc.|TSR]]| isbn=0-88038-608-8}}</ref>

Various products detailing specific areas of Faer<U+00FB>n have been released, and as such much of the continent has been heavily detailed and documented to create a highly developed setting.

In early editions of the setting, ''The Realms'' shared a unified [[cosmology]] with various other [[campaign setting]]s called the Great Wheel. In this way each of the ''Dungeons & Dragons'' campaign settings were linked together to form one interwoven world connected by various [[Plane (Dungeons & Dragons)|planes]] of existence. With the release of the 2001 ''Forgotten Realms Campaign Setting'', the setting was given its own distinct and separate cosmological arrangement, with unique planes not explicitly connected to those of the other settings.<ref name=FRCS3rd>{{cite book | last=Greenwood | first=Ed | coauthors= Sean K Reynolds, Skip Williams, Rob Heinsoo | year=2001 | title=Forgotten Realms Campaign Setting | publisher=Wizards of the Coast | isbn=0-7869-1836-5}}</ref><ref name=playerguidetofaerun04 >{{cite book | last=Baker | first=Richard | coauthors= James Wyatt | year=2004 | title=Player's Guide To Faer<U+00FB>n| publisher=Wizards of the Coast | isbn=0-7869-3134-5}}</ref>

===Religion===
Religion plays a large part in the ''Forgotten Realms'', with deities and their followers being an integral part of the world. They do not have a passive role, but in fact interact directly in mortal affairs, answer prayers, and have their own personal agendas. All deities must have worshippers to survive, and all mortals must worship a patron deity to secure a good afterlife. A huge number of diverse deities exist within several [[polytheism|polytheistic]] pantheons; a large number of supplements have documented many of them, some in more detail than others.<ref>{{cite book| last=Boyd| first=Eric L.| authorlink=Eric L. Boyd| year=1998| title=Demihuman Deities| publisher=[[TSR, Inc.|TSR]]| isbn=0-7869-1239-1}}</ref><ref>{{cite book| last=Boyd| first=Eric L.| authorlink=Eric L. Boyd| coauthors=[[Erik Mona]]| year=2002| title=Faiths and Pantheons| publisher=[[Wizards of the Coast]]| isbn=0-7869-2759-3}}</ref>

Much of the history of ''The Realms'' detailed in novels and source books is concerned with the actions of various deities or ''The Chosen'', mortal representatives with a portion of their deities' power, such as [[Elminster]], Fzoul Chembryl, Midnight who later became the new embodiment of the goddess of magic, [[Mystra (goddess)|Mystra]], and the [[Seven Sisters (Forgotten Realms)|Seven Sisters]].

Above all other deities is [[Lord Ao|Ao]] the Overlord. Ao does not sanction worshipers and distances himself from mortals. He is single-handedly responsible for the [[Time of Troubles (Forgotten Realms)|Time of Troubles]], or Godswar, as seen in ''[[The Avatar Trilogy]]''.

===Characters===
The setting is the home of several iconic characters popularized by authors, including [[Elminster Aumar|Elminster]] the wizard, who has appeared in several series of novels created by Greenwood himself, and [[Drizzt Do'Urden]] the highly popular [[Drow (Dungeons & Dragons)|drow]], or dark elf, ranger created by [[R. A. Salvatore]].
