==Background and recording==
Tucker told [[the Portland Mercury]] that she was recording the album in April 2010, and said it was "definitely more of a middle-aged mom record, in a way. It's not a record that a young person would write."  Tucker said that her influences for this album included [[The Lion and the Cobra]], as well as [[the Slits]], [[the Raincoats]], and [[the English Beat]].<ref>[http://www.portlandmercury.com/portland/words-and-guitar/Content?oid=2416788 Words and Guitar: Tucker's 1st Solo Album after Sleater-Kinney]</ref> The origins of these songs lie in material Tucker wrote for live performances in early 2009 in Portland, after which many people encouraged her to make her own album. <U+201C>Everyone was saying, <U+2018>Oh, it<U+2019>d be cool if you made a record<U+2019>,<U+201D> Tucker recalls. <U+201C>So I thought, Yeah! I should!<U+201D> According to the [[Kill Rock Stars]] website, Tucker said this regarding the making of the album: <U+201C>I wanted to be completely open in terms of instrumentation. I thought it<U+2019>d be cool to do some acoustic songs, to create something quiet that could be powerful at the same time.<U+201D><ref>[http://www.killrockstars.com/press/krs520/ The Corin Tucker Band 1000 Years, KRS]</ref> 
==Reception==
According to [[Metacritic]], the album got mostly positive reviews; on Metacritic its weighted average is 76 out of 100, indicating "generally favorable reviews." The most positive review was from [[Robert Christgau]], who gave it an A and called it "A deep, pained, sober, subtle album". This contrasted starkly with the most negative review, a C+ from EW's [[Whitney Pastorek]], who said that, on the album, {{quote|Corin Tucker's voice <U+2014> always so uniquely emotive in the punkier contexts of S-K <U+2014> looms uncomfortably over songs that sound scrapbooked from other '90s-centric acts ([[Liz Phair]], [[Pavement (band)|Pavement]]) but never take on a form of their own.}}
