|publisher=Israel Airports Authority| quote=See separate airport statistics entries for each airport.|accessdate=2007-05-09}}</ref> located near the town of [[Lod]], 15&nbsp;kilometers southeast of [[Tel Aviv]]. It is operated by the [[Israel Airports Authority]], a [[government-owned corporation]] that manages all public [[airport]]s and [[Border control|border crossing]]s in the [[State of Israel]].
The airport, named after the first [[Prime Minister of Israel]], [[David Ben-Gurion]], is the hub of [[El Al Israel Airlines]], [[Israir Airlines]], [[Arkia Israel Airlines]], and [[Sun D'Or]]. During the 1980s and 1990s, it was a [[focus city]] of the now-defunct [[Tower Air]]. Today, [[Airport terminal|Terminal]] 3 is used for international flights and Terminal 1, for domestic flights. The airport has three runways and is jointly used by commercial, private, and military aircraft.

The airport is located on the main [[Jerusalem]]-Tel Aviv Highway, [[Highway 1 (Israel)|Highway 1]], and can be easily reached by car or public bus. Both [[Egged]] and [[Dan Bus Cooperative|Dan]] ply this route. [[Israel Railways]] operates train service to and from the airport, and taxis are also available onsite. Another popular transportation option is a shared taxi van called a [[sherut]].

Ben Gurion Airport is known as one of the most secure airports in the world.  The security force includes [[Israel Defense Forces|IDF]] and police.  Security guards operate both [[undercover]] and in uniform, allowing for the detection of a wide range of threats.  The airport has been targeted for several [[Terrorism|terrorist]] attacks, but no successful [[Aircraft hijacking|hijacking of a plane]] departing from Ben Gurion has ever taken place.

==History== 
[[Image:LyddaAirport.jpg|thumb|250px|Historical map of Lydda Airport]]
Ben Gurion International Airport started out in 1936 as Lydda Airport, an airstrip of 4 concrete runways on the outskirts of the Arab town of Lydda. It was built by the [[British Mandate of Palestine]], chiefly for military purposes.<ref name="30's">{{cite web |url=http://www.iaa.gov.il/Rashat/en-US/Airports/BenGurion/AbouttheAirport/History/30/ |title=Ben Gurion Airoprt- The 30's |accessdate=2007-04-27 |publisher=Israel Airports Authority}}</ref> The importance of the facility rose during World War II, as planes arrived from Europe, the Far East and other countries in the Middle East. The first civilian transatlantic route, Tel Aviv-New York, was inaugurated by [[Trans World Airlines|TWA]] in 1946. The British left the airport at the end of April 1948,  and the soldiers of the [[Israel Defence Force]] captured it on [[July 10]], [[1948]], in [[Operation Danny]], transferring control to the newly [[Declaration of the Establishment of the State of Israel|declared State of Israel]]. From 1948 until 1973, when it was renamed after Israeli Prime Minister [[David Ben Gurion]], it was known as Lod Airport, the Hebrew name for Lydda. Flights resumed on November 24, 1948.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.iaa.gov.il/Rashat/en-US/Airports/BenGurion/AbouttheAirport/History/40/ |title=Ben Gurion Airoprt- The 40's|accessdate=2007-04-29 |publisher=Israel Airports Authority}}</ref> That year, 40,000 passengers passed through the terminal. By 1952, the number had risen to 100,000 a month. Within a decade, air traffic increased to the point where local flights had to be redirected to the [[Sde Dov Airport|Sde Dov]] airstrip on the northern Tel Aviv coast. By the mid-1960s, 14 international airlines were landing at Lod Airport. More buildings and runways were added over the years, but with the onset of mass [[aliyah|immigration]] from [[Ethiopian_Jews#Israel_intervenes|Ethiopia]] and the former [[Aliyah#Aliyah_from_the_Soviet_Union_and_post-Soviet_states|Soviet Union]] in the 1980s and 90s, the existing facilities became painfully inadequate, prompting the design of new state-of-the art terminal that could accommodate the expected tourism influx for the 2000 millennium celebrations. The decision to go ahead with project was reached in January 1994, but Terminal 3 only opened its doors a decade later, on November 2, 2004.<ref>{{citeweb | url=http://www.historycentral.com/Aviation/airports/Bengurion.html | title=Ben Gurion | accessdate=2007-04-29 | publisher=History Central}}</ref>

===Operation of the Old Terminal===
Initially, the departures [[Airport Check-in|check-in area]] was located on the ground floor. Passengers would proceed upstairs on to the main departures hall, which contained [[passport]] control, [[duty-free shop]]s, [[Airport lounge|VIP lounge]]s, one [[synagogue]] and boarding gates. At the gates, travelers would be required to descend a flight of stairs to return to the ground floor where the waiting buses would transport them to their airplane on the [[Airport ramp|tarmac]]. The arrivals hall with passport control, luggage carousels, duty-free pick-up, and [[customs]] was on the south end of the building. Buses transferred passengers and crews to the terminal from the airplanes that parked on the [[tarmac]] over 500 meters away. After Terminal 3 opened, Terminal 1 was closed except for government flights such as special [[immigrant]] flights from North America and Africa.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.historycentral.com/Aviation/airports/Bengurion.html |title=Ben Gurion Airport|accessdate=2007-04-28|publisher=HistoryCentral}}</ref>

===Terrorism===
While Ben Gurion Airport has been a target of [[Palestinian terrorism|Palestinian terrorist]] groups, the adoption of [[airport security|strict security precaution]]s has ensured that no aircraft departing from Ben Gurion airport has ever been [[Aircraft hijacking|hijacked]]. On the other hand, airliners hijacked from other countries have landed at Ben Gurion, contributing to two major incidents in the airport's history. In the first, on [[May 8]], [[1972]], four Palestinian [[Black September (group)|Black September]] terrorists [[Hijacking of Sabena Flight 572|hijacked a Sabena flight]] en-route from Vienna, and forced it to land at Ben Gurion airport. [[Sayeret Matkal]] commandos led by [[Ehud Barak]] stormed the plane, killing two of the hijackers and capturing the other two. One passenger was killed.<ref>{{Cite news | last =Sontag | first =Deborah | title =2 Who Share a Past Are Rivals for Israel's Future | publisher = [[The New York Times]] | pages =Section A, Page 3, Column 1 | year =1999 | url =http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F30917FD3D5E0C738EDDAD0894D1494D81&n=Top%2fReference%2fTimes%20Topics%2fPeople%2fB%2fBarak%2c%20Ehud| date =1999-04-20  }}</ref> Later that month, on [[May 30]], [[1972]], in an attack known as the [[Lod Airport Massacre]], 24 people were killed and 80 injured when three members of the [[Japanese Red Army]] sprayed machine gun fire into the passenger arrival area.

In [[2006]] the airport handled over 8.8 million international (an increase of almost four percent from the previous year), and 405,000 domestic passengers. The largest airlines on international routes were: [[El Al]] (40.6% of flights), [[Lufthansa]] (4.16%), [[Continental Airlines]] (3.96%), [[Israir]] (3.85%) and [[Arkia]] (3.83%).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.port2port.com/Index.asp?CategoryID=44&ArticleID=1205 |title=Israel Airports Authority: number of overseas air travelers up 3.6% in 2006|accessdate=2007-04-28 |date=2007-01-07 |publisher=PORT2PORT-Israel's Trade Portal}}</ref>

2000 was a record year for the volume of passengers at Ben Gurion International Airport. That year, over 9.3 million international and 577,000 domestic passengers passed through its gates.

In December 2006, Ben Gurion International Airport ranked first among 40 European airports, and 8th out of 77 airports the world, in a survey conducted by [[Airports Council International]]. It was also placed first in its size category. The survey consisted of 34 questions. A random sampling of 350 passengers at the departure gate were asked how satisfied they were with the service, infrastructure and facilities. Ben Gurion received a rating of 3.94 out of 5, followed by Vienna, Munich, Amsterdam, Brussels, Zurich, Copenhagen and Helsinki.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1164881920231&pagename=JPost%2FJPArticle%2FShowFull |title=Ben Gurion ranks first in airport survey |accessdate=2007-04-27 |first=Avi|last= Krawitz |date=2006-12-18 |publisher=[[The Jerusalem Post]]}}</ref>

==Terminals==
===Terminal 1===
[[Image:Airport Tel Aviv Bengurion.jpg|thumb|250px|Exterior view of the domestic Terminal 1]] 
Terminal 1 has recently re-opened as the domestic terminal following extensive renovations.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.iaa.gov.il/Rashat/en-US/Rashot/MessagesArchive/SpokesMan/Spokesman_En_200207.htm |title=End of an Era <U+2013> The Historic Terminal 1 has Reopened, Serving Passengers on Domestic Flights |accessdate=2007-04-28 |date=2007-02-20 |publisher=Israel Airports Authority}}</ref> While it was closed, the building served as a venue for various events and large-scale exhibitions including the "[[Bezalel Academy of Art and Design|Bezalel Academy of Arts]] Centennial Exhibition" which was held there in 2006. There is now talk of keeping Terminal 1 open 24 hours a day in order to handle [[charter flight]]s from Europe.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/850775.html |title=Transportation Ministry recommends unlimited airline competition |accessdate=2007-04-28 |last=Bior |first=Haim|date=2007-04-20|publisher=[[Haaretz]]}}</ref> 

On February 2006, the [[Israel Airports Authority]] (IAA) announced plans to invest 4.3 million [[Israeli new sheqel|NIS]] in a new VIP wing for [[Business jet|private jet]] passengers and crews, as well as others interested in avoiding the main terminal. VIP ground services already exist, but a substantial increase in users has justified expanding the facilities, which will also boost airport revenues. The IAA released figures showing significant growth in private jet flights (4,059, a 36.5% increase from 2004) as well as private jet users (14,613, a 46.2% increase from 2004). The new VIP wing, operated by an outside licensee, will be located in an upgraded and expanded section of Terminal 1. All flight procedures (security check, passport control, and customs) will be handled here. This wing will include a hall equipped for [[press conference]]s, a deluxe lounge, special meeting rooms equipped with state-of-the-art business facilities, and a designated lounge for flight crews who spend time at the airport between flights.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.iaa.gov.il/Rashat/en-US/Rashot/MessagesArchive/SpokesMan/Spokesman_En_210206.htm |title=Israel Airports Authority to Build a Special Terminal for Executive and Private Flights at Ben Gurion Airport |accessdate=2007-04-28 |date=2006-02-21 |publisher=Israel Airports Authority}}</ref>

===Terminal 2=== 
Terminal 2 served domestic flights until [[20 February]], [[2007]] when these services moved into the refurbished Terminal 1. Due to increased traffic in the late 1990s and [[over-capacity]] reached at Terminal 1, an international section was added until Terminal 3 was opened. Terminal 2 is slated to be demolished to make room for more freight areas.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.iaa.gov.il/Rashat/en-US/Rashot/MessagesArchive/SpokesMan/Spokesman_En_061106.htm |title=The adaptation of Terminal 1 for handling domestic flights to be completed during the first quarter of 2007 |accessdate=2007-04-28 |date=2006-11-05|publisher=Israel Airports Authority|quote=the building of Terminal 2 will be demolished, and the area on which it stood will be turned into an operational site for a third freight handler <U+2013> Swissport Ltd.}}</ref>

===Terminal 3=== 

[[Image:BenGuArr.jpg|thumb|250px|Terminal 3 Arrivals Hall]]
[[Image:BenGuOut.jpg|thumb|250px|Concourse B of Terminal 3]]

Terminal 3, which opened on [[October 28]], [[2004]],<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.mfa.gov.il/MFA/Government/Speeches+by+Israeli+leaders/2004/Address%20by%20PM%20Sharon%20at%20inauguration%20of%20Ben%20Gurion%20Airport%202000%2028-Oct-2004|title= Address by PM Sharon at inauguration of Ben Gurion Airport 2000
|accessdate=2007-04-27 | publisher=Israel Ministry of Foreign Affairs}}</ref>replaced Terminal 1 as the main international gateway to and from Israel. The building was designed by [[Black and Veatch]], [[Skidmore, Owings and Merrill]] (SOM) and [[Moshe Safdie]], along with [[Ram Karmi]] and other Israeli architects. The inaugural flight was an [[El Al]] flight to [[John F. Kennedy International Airport]] in [[New York]]. 

The new terminal is currently built to serve over 10 million passengers per year, although it could accommodate 16 million passengers a year with the addition of two concourses to the existing three. No future expansion is expected beyond this due to the proximity of the airport to the country's largest population centers and the problem of [[noise pollution]]. If necessary, another international airport will be built elsewhere in the country.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iaa.gov.il/Rashat/en-US/Airports/BenGurion/AbouttheAirport/Statistics/ |title=Facts and Figures |accessdate=2007-05-04|publisher=Israel Airports Authority}}</ref>

Work on ''Natbag 2000'', as the Terminal 3 project was known, was scheduled for completion prior to 2000 in order to handle a massive influx of [[pilgrim]]s expected for the [[Great Jubilee|Millennium celebrations]]. This deadline was not met due to higher than anticipated costs and a series of work stoppages in the wake of the  bankruptcy of the main Turkish contractor. The project eventually cost an estimated one billion US dollars - one of the largest infrastructure projects in Israel in recent years.

Terminal 3 uses the [[Jetway]] system. The overall layout is similar to that of airports in Europe and North America, with multiple levels, and considerable distances to walk after disembarking from the aircraft. The walk is assisted by [[escalators]] and [[Escalators#Moving walkways|moving walkways]]. The ground floor departures hall, with an area of over 10,000 sq. meters, is equipped with 110 [[Airport Check-in|check-in counters]] and as well as [[Flight information display system]]s.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.iaa.gov.il/Rashat/en-US/Airports/BenGurion/AbouttheAirport/PassengersHalls/CheckInHall/ |title=Check-In Hall |accessdate=2007-04-28 |publisher=Israel Airports Authority}}</ref> A small [[shopping mall]], known as Buy & Bye, is open to both travelers and the general public. The mall includes shops, restaurants, and a post office. On the same level as the mall, passengers enter passport control and the security check. Planes taking off and landing can be viewed from a distinctive tilted glass wall. Terminal 3 has two synagogues and a Muslim prayer room.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3342862,00.html | title=Muslim prayer room set up at Ben-Gurion Airport | publisher=Ynet | accessdate=2007-05-05}}</ref>

After the main security check, passengers wait for their flights in the star-shaped duty-free rotunda. A variety of cafes, restaurants and duty free shops are located there, open 24 hours a day, as well as banking facilities and a desk for [[value added tax|VAT]] refunds.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://parking.essentialtravel.co.uk/worldairport/israel/tel_aviv_-_ben_gurion.htm| title=Tel Aviv <U+2013> Ben Gurion Airport (TLV) Information| publisher=Essential Travel|accessdate=2007-04-29}}</ref> 

Terminal 3 has three concourses (B, C, and D), each leading to eight jetways (numbered 2 through 9). Each concourse is equipped with two bus bays (1 and 1A) from which passengers board the aircraft. Two additional concourses (A and E) will be built if passenger traffic warrants expansion. Free [[Wi-Fi|wireless internet]] is provided throughout the terminal.<ref>{{cite web|title=Free Wi-Fi in Airports|url=http://www.wififreespot.com/airport.html|accessdate=2007-05-04}}</ref>
The terminal has two business lounges -  the [[El Al]] [[King David Lounge]] and the Dan Lounge. In January 2007, the IAA announced plans for a 120-bed hotel at Terminal 3.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.port2port.com/Index.asp?CategoryID=46&ArticleID=1210 |title=A BOT tender to be published for Ben Gurion hotel |accessdate=2007-04-28 |date=2007-01-15 |publisher=PORT2PORT- Israel's Trade Portal}}</ref>

===Terminal 4===
This Terminal, built in 1999, was meant to handle the crowds expected 2000, but never officially opened. To date, it has only been used as a terminal for passengers arriving from Asia during the [[SARS]] epidemic.<ref>{{cite news |first=Michael |last=Strongin |title=Ministry begins checking for SARS at Ben-Gurion |url=http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/jpost/access/330779551.html?dids=330779551:330779551&FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT&date=Apr+30%2C+2003&author=MICHAEL+STRONGIN&pub=Jerusalem+Post&edition=&startpage=03&desc=Ministry+begins+checking+for+SARS+at+Ben-Gurion |publisher=[[The Jerusalem Post]]|page=3 |date=2003-04-30}}</ref>

==Security==

Ben Gurion International Airport is one of the world's most [[airport security|heavily secured airports]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.boston.com/news/globe/editorial_opinion/oped/articles/2006/08/23/what_israeli_security_could_teach_us/ |title=What Israeli security could teach us |accessdate=2007-04-27|last=Jacoby |first=Jeff |date=2006-08-23 |publisher=[[The Boston Globe]] |pages= |language= |archiveurl= |archivedate= |quote= }}</ref> Security operates on several levels.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.time.com/time/covers/1101010924/belal.html |title=Is This What We Really Want? |accessdate=2007-04-27 |last=Beyer |first=Lisa |publisher=[[TIME]]}}</ref>

*All cars, taxis, buses and trucks go through a preliminary security checkpoint before entering the airport compound. Armed guards spot-check the vehicles by looking into cars and taxis, boarding buses, and exchanging a few words with the driver and passengers.

*Armed security personnel stationed at the terminal entrances keep a close watch on those who enter the buildings. If someone arouses their suspicion or looks nervous, they may strike up a conversation to further assess the person's intent. [[Undercover|Plainclothes]] armed personnel patrol the area outside the building, and hidden [[surveillance camera]]s operate at all times.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://securitysolutions.com/news/security_exposing_hostile_intent|title=What can we learn from Ben Gurion Airport in Israel to help push aviation security in the U.S. to the next level?|publisher=Access Control & Security Systems|accessdate=2007-05-04}}</ref>

*Inside the building, both uniformed and plainclothes security officers are on constant patrol.

*Departing passengers are personally questioned by security agents even before arriving at the check-in desk. This interview can last as little as five minutes, or as long as an hour if a passenger is selected for additional screening. Luggage and [[Strip search|body search]]es may be conducted. After the search, bags are placed through an X-Ray machine before passengers proceed to the check-in counters.

*After check-in, [[checked baggage]] is put in a pressure chamber to trigger any possible explosive devices. Passengers continue through to personal security and passport control, as in other airports. Before passing through the [[metal detector]]s and placing hand baggage through the [[X-ray machine]], passports are re-checked and additional questions may be asked. Before boarding the aircraft, passports and boarding passes are checked once again. 

*Security procedures for incoming flights are not as stringent, but passengers may be questioned by passport control depending on country of origin, or countries visited prior to arrival in Israel. Passengers who have recently visited countries at war with Israel (all Arab countries except Jordan, Egypt, and Mauritania) may be subject to further questioning.<ref>{{citation|title=Israel airport is safe but hard to emulate|url=http://archives.californiaaviation.org/airport/msg17059.html|publisher=The Wall Street Journal|date=2001-09-17|first=Paulo|last=Prada|first2=Daniel|last2=Michaels|accessdate=2007-05-04}}</ref>

==Runways==
[[Image:Bengurionrunways.gif|thumb|250px|Ben Gurion Satellite Map]]
===Main runway===
The closest [[runway]] to terminals 1 and 3 is 12/30, and is followed by a [[taxiway]]. Most [[landing]]s take place on this runway from West to East, approaching from the [[Mediterranean Sea]] over southern Tel Aviv.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.airports-worldwide.com/israel/ben_gurion_israel.htm |title=Ben Gurion Airport |accessdate=2007-04-27 |publisher=World Aero Data }}</ref>

During inclement weather, it may also be used for [[takeoff]]s (Direction 12).

===Short runway===

In the past, mainly served [[cargo aircraft]] of the [[Israeli Air Force]], and today serves mostly as a get-ready lane for the [[Aircraft noise|Quiet Runway]].

Rarely, it is used for landing from north to south (Direction 21).<ref>http://www.azworldairports.com/airports/p1800tlv.htm</ref>

===Quiet runway===

The longest runway in the airfield, 3.6 km, and the main take off runway from east to west (Direction 26/08), referred to as "the quiet runway" since jets taking off in this direction produce less [[noise pollution]] for surrounding residents. This is the newest runway in the airport, built in the early 1970s. A 24 million NIS renovation project completed in February 2006 reinforced the runway and made it suitable for future [[wide-body aircraft]] such as the new [[Airbus A380]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.iaa.gov.il/Rashat/en-US/Rashot/MessagesArchive/SpokesMan/Spokesman_En_070306.htm |title=Renovation of Runway 26-08 Completed; Became Operative on Sunday, February 26 |accessdate=2007-04-28 |date=2006-03-07 |publisher=Israel Aiports Authority}}</ref>

A new [[Israel Railways]] service links Terminal 3 to [[Tel Aviv]] and destinations to the north.<ref>{{cite web|title=Ben-Gurion Airport Station|url=http://www.israrail.org.il/english/travel/natbag.html|publisher=Israel Railways|accessdate=2007-05-03}}</ref> The journey to Tel Aviv takes about fifteen minutes and costs 12 NIS (approx. US$2.80). Over a million passengers used the line in 2005.<ref>{{cite web|language=Hebrew|title=Natbag Line|url=http://www.israrail.org.il/travel/natbag2000.html|publisher=Israel Railways|accessdate=2007-05-04}}</ref>

An extension of this line heading towards [[Lod]] opened at the end of 2006, enabling connections to southern destinations on the rail network as well, such as [[Be'er Sheva]], [[Jerusalem]] and [[Ashdod]]. This extension is the first phase of a new rail line from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem with a spur to [[Modi'in]]. Construction on this line is scheduled to be completed in 2007 (Modi'in) and 2012 (Jerusalem).<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?pagename=JPost%2FJPArticle%2FShowFull&cid=1170359814381 |publisher=[[The Jerusalem Post]] |last=Afra |first=Orit |title=Panacea or pain? |date=2007-02-08 |accessdate=2007-04-27}}</ref>

The airport is served by regular inter-city bus lines, a special [[airport shuttle]] with express service to Tel Aviv, [[Sherut]] "shared" door to door taxi vans, and standard taxis.<ref>{{cite web| title=Guidelines for Taxi Passengers| url=http://www.iaa.gov.il/Rashat/en-US/Airports/BenGurion/InformationforTravelers/TransportationToandFromtheAirport/Taxis/| publisher=Israel Airports Authority| accessdate=2007-04-27}}</ref> An [[Egged Bus Cooperative|Egged]] #5 shuttle bus ferries passengers between the terminals and a small bus terminal in the [[Airport City]] industrial park where they can connect to regular Egged bus routes passing through the area.

Other bus companies directly serve Terminal 3, and the airport also provides a free shuttle bus.<ref>{{cite web| title=Public Transportation| url=http://www.iaa.gov.il/Rashat/en-US/Airports/BenGurion/InformationforTravelers/TransportationToandFromtheAirport/PublicTransport/|publisher=Israel Airports Authority| accessdate=2007-04-27}}</ref>
