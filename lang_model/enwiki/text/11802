'''[[Kuwait Airways]] Flight 422''' was a [[Boeing 747]] jumbo jet hijacked en route from [[Bangkok]], Thailand, to [[Kuwait]] on April 5, 1988, leading to a hostage crisis that lasted 16 days and encompassed three continents. The hijacking was carried out by several [[Lebanese people|Lebanese]] guerillas who demanded the release of 17 [[Shi'ite Muslim]] prisoners being held by Kuwait for their role in the [[1983 Kuwait bombings]]. During the incident the flight, initially forced to land in Iran, travelled 3,200 miles from [[Mashhad]] in northeastern Iran to [[Larnaca]], [[Cyprus]], and finally to [[Algiers]]. 

Kuwait sent officials to negotiate with the group, but talks were frustrated because they refused to release the prisoners. Two hostages were killed during the course of the siege, before it eventually ended in [[Algiers]] on April 20. The hijackers <U+2013> who were suspected by Kuwait of belonging to the Lebanon-based [[Hezbollah]] organisation <U+2013> were given passage out of Algeria. With a duration of 16 days the crisis became one of the world's longest skyjackings. It also inspired an armed siege at a high school in the United States a few days later.

==Initial hijacking and flight to Iran==

On April 5, 1988 Flight 422 had 112 passengers and crew aboard, including three members of the [[Kuwaiti Royal Family]].<ref name=Philly-1988-04-06>{{cite news|first=Michael |last=Ross |url=http://articles.philly.com/1988-04-06/news/26252871_1_hijackers-kuwait-airways-flight-ku-kuwaiti-royal-family |title=Arab Gunmen Hijack Kuwaiti Plane To Iran |newspaper= |publisher=Philadelphia Media Network |date=April 6, 1988 |accessdate=June 13, 2013}}</ref><ref name=AP-1988-04-12>{{cite news|url=http://www.apnewsarchive.com/1988/Chronology-of-Events-in-Hijacking-of-Kuwait-Airways-Flight-422-With-AM-Hijack-Bjt/id-00e7a073af0d87fd8734c3dd4fa5a682 |title=Chronology of Events in Hijacking of Kuwait Airways Flight 422 With AM-Hijack Bjt |publisher=Apnewsarchive.com |date=April 12, 1988 |accessdate=June 13, 2013}}</ref> It was about three hours out of Bangkok, over the [[Gulf of Oman]] when a number of Lebanese men armed with guns and hand grenades took control of the plane.<ref name=Philly-1988-04-06/><ref name=BBC-1988-04-05/> A passenger later reported the hijackers to have said, "Don't worry, we are after redressing our rights denied by the Kuwaiti government".

The hijackers were reported to number six or seven, and included [[Hassan Izz-Al-Din]], who had previously been involved in the 1985 hijacking of [[TWA Flight 847]].<ref name=BBC-1988-04-05/><ref>{{cite book|first= Magnos|last= Ranstorp|title= Hizb'allah in Lebanon: The Politics of the Western Hostage Crisis|year= 1997|publisher= Palgrave McMillan|isbn= 0312164912|page=95}}</ref><ref name=Time-1988-04-25/> Following negotiations with the Iranian Prime Minister 25 hostages  were released <U+2013> a man with a heart condition on April 5, and 24 women the following day.<ref name=AP-1988-04-12/> A further 32 were allowed to leave the plane on April 7 after the [[Government of Kuwait|Kuwaiti government]] sent a team of negotiators to Iran to talk to the hijackers.<ref name=AP-1988-04-12/> However, negotiations were frustrated by Kuwait's support for Iraq in the ongoing [[Iran<U+2013>Iraq War|Gulf Conflict]] between that country and Iran, and because the 17 prisoners were Iranians.<ref name=BBC-1988-04-05/> No more hostages were released in Iran, and hijackers forced authorities to refuel the plane by threatening to take off with almost empty fuel tanks, and shooting at security officials.<ref name=AP-1988-04-12/><ref name=BBC-1988-04-05/>

==Cyprus, Algeria and hostage deaths==

The plane took off from Mashhad on April 8, but was refused landing permission at both [[Beirut]] in Lebanon and [[Damascus]], Syria. However, after seven hours Cypriot authorities granted permission for it to land at [[Larnaca]], where negotiations continued.<ref name=AP-1988-04-12/> Officials from Cyprus and the [[Palestinian Liberation Organisation]] (PLO) engaged in talks with the hijackers, resulting in the release of a hostage on April 9.

The plane was refueled, and on April 13 took off again, this time heading for Algeria, which had given it permission to land there,<ref name=Time-1988-04-25/> and the final week of the hijack played itself out at [[Houari Boumedienne Airport]] in [[Algiers]].<ref name=BBC-1988-04-05/><ref name=LATimes-1988-04-22/><ref name=DesertNews-1988-04-23/> Algeria <U+2013> which had been a key player in the 1981 resolution of the [[Iran hostage crisis]] <U+2013> began talks with the hijackers as soon as the plane touched down in Algiers.<ref name=Time-1988-04-25/> The aircraft was parked close to the terminal building, but was asked to move briefly as a security measure upon the arrival of a flight carrying [[President of Zambia]] [[Kenneth Kaunda]].<ref name=Time-1988-04-25/>

Many of the freed passengers claimed that Iran had aided the hijackers by providing weapons and explosives while the plane was at [[Mashhad Airport]].<ref name=Gazette-1988-04-22/> Kuwaiti security officer Khaled Nasser Zaferi said that several more men boarded the plane after landing in Iran. [T]hey produced a submachine gun and explosives they didn't have before.

The hijacking prompted an incident at [[San Gabriel High School]] in [[San Gabriel, California|San Gabriel]], [[California]] on April 26, 1988, when student Jeffrey Lyne Cox held a humanities class hostage with a semi-automatic rifle for over 30 minutes. Cox, who threatened to kill his classmates, was overpowered by fellow students, then detained by police. A friend later told the press that Cox had been inspired by the hijacking and the [[Stephen King]] novel ''[[Rage (Stephen King novel)|Rage]]''.<ref name="Press-Courier">{{cite news|url= http://news.google.ca/newspapers?id=6MFdAAAAIBAJ&sjid=OF4NAAAAIBAJ&pg=3128,4824971|title= Hijack Tied to Teen Classroom Siege|newspaper= Oxnard Press-Courier|date= April 27, 1988|accessdate= June 17, 2013|page= 1}}</ref>
