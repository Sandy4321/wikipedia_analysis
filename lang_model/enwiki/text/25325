Colombia is the [[List of countries and outlying territories by total area|26th most extensive nation]] in the world and the fourth most extensive in South America (after Brazil, [[Argentina]], and Peru), with an area more than twice that of [[France]]. It also has the [[List of countries by population|third-largest population]] in Latin America after Brazil and [[Mexico]].<ref name = "USNEWS"> {{cite web | author =Michael Baron | url = http://www.usnews.com/blogs/barone/2007/5/10/on-novaks-book-and-colombia.html | title = On Novak's Book and Colombia | work = US News | date = 2007-05-10| accessdate = 2008-02-29 | language = English}}</ref>

The territory of what is now Colombia was originally inhabited by indigenous tribes which had migrated from North and Central America, including the [[Muisca]], [[Quimbaya civilization|Quimbaya]], and [[Tairona]]. To the south lay the [[Inca Empire]].<ref>[http://books.google.com/books?id=lPXoMqGQkZUC] Colombia. By Krzysztof Dydynski, Published 2003 Lonely Planet Kolumbie ISBN 0864426747 </ref> The [[Spain|Spanish]] arrived in 1499, and initiated a period of conquest and colonisation which ultimately led to the creation of the [[Viceroyalty of New Granada]] (comprising what is now Colombia, Venezuela, Ecuador and Panama) with its capital at [[Bogot<U+00E1>]].<ref name = "LABLAA6"> {{cite web | author = Nicol<U+00E1>s del Castillo Mathieu  | url = http://www.lablaa.org/blaavirtual/revistas/credencial/marzo1992/marzo3.htm | title = LA PRIMERA VISION DE LAS COSTAS COLOMBIANAS, Repaso de Historia | work = Revista Credencial | date = March, 1992| accessdate = 2008-02-29 | language = Spanish}}</ref> Independence from Spain was won in 1819, but by 1830 "[[Gran Colombia]]" had collapsed with the secession of Venezuela and Ecuador. Modern day Colombia, with Panama, emerged as the [[Republic of New Granada]]. The new nation experimented with federalism as the [[Granadine Confederation]] (1858), and then the [[United States of Colombia]] (1863), before the Republic of Colombia was finally declared in 1886.<ref name=CIA_World_Factbook/> Panama [[Separation of Panama from Colombia|seceded]] in 1903.

Colombia has a long tradition of constitutional government, and the [[Colombian Conservative Party|Conservative]] and [[Colombian Liberal Party|Liberal]] parties, founded in 1843 and 1848 respectively, are two of the oldest surviving political parties in the Americas. However, tensions between the two have frequently erupted into violence, most notably in the [[Thousand Days War]] (1899-1902) and [[La Violencia]], beginning in 1948. Since the 1960s, government forces have been engaged in conflict with left-wing insurgents and illegal right-wing paramilitaries. Fuelled by the cocaine trade, this escalated dramatically in the 1990s. However, the insurgents lack the military or popular support necessary to overthrow the government, and in recent years the violence has been decreasing. Insurgents continue attacks against civilians, and large swathes of the countryside remain under guerrilla influence, but the Colombian government has stepped up efforts to reassert government control throughout the country, and now has a presence in every one of its municipalities.<ref name=CIA_World_Factbook/>

Colombia is very ethnically diverse, and the interaction between descendents of the original [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|native]] inhabitants, [[Spanish people|Spanish]] colonisers, [[Africa]]n slaves and twentieth-century immigrants from [[Europe]] and the [[Middle East]] has produced a rich cultural heritage. This has also been influenced by Colombia's incredibly varied geography. The majority of the urban centres are located in the highlands of the [[Andes|Andes mountains]], but Colombian territory also encompasses [[Amazon rainforest]], [[Llanos|tropical grassland]] and both Caribbean and Pacific coastlines. Ecologically, Colombia is considered to be among 17 of the most [[megadiverse countries]] in the world.<ref name = "cwlvaj">{{cite news | first= | last= | coauthors= | title=South America Banks on Regional Strategy to Safeguard Quarter of Earth's Biodiversity | date= | publisher= | url =http://www.conservation.org/xp/news/press_releases/2003/091603_andean_eng.xml | work =Conservation International | pages = | accessdate = 2007-06-29 | language = }}</ref>
