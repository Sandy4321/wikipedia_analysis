'''Lima Central Catholic High School''' is located in [[Lima, Ohio|Lima]] [[Ohio]]. LCC, short for Lima Central Catholic, is a private, parochial school with the capacity to hold over six-hundred and fifty students.  Enrollment has remained around four-hundred students for a number of years.  It is part of the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Toledo]].

==History==
The current school building was built in 1960. Before then, the school was housed in two of the elementary schools St. Rose and St. Gerard as two different high schools. In 1959, with the collaboration of St. Rose, St. Gerard, St. John's and St. Charles elementary schools, Bishop George J. Rehring began construction of the current school building.

In 1960, the school opened its doors in the new building with Fr. Herr (pronounced her) as its first principal. In 1962, two wings were added to the building. Fr. Herr, who received the title of Monsignor in 1963, held the position of principal until the 1980s and was succeeded by Daniel Rupert until 1997. In 1998, Fr. Dennis Hardigan became the pastor/president of LCC. Under his guidance, a new Science and Technology Center was built in 2002 and a new Athletic and Convocation Center in 2003. In 2004, Fr. Todd Dominique was named pastor/president. In 2006, Mr. Richard Mitterholzer was named the new principal. Mr. Mitterholzer resigned from his position in 2011. Mr. Walter Klimaski was named the new President of Lima Central Catholic during the summer of 2011.

==Grade Schools==

Lima Central Catholic is fed in by three Catholic city grade schools. St. Rose, St. Gerard and St. Charles. Each grade school consists of grades Pre-8th. The three grade schools come together to make the Junior High Lima Central Catholic Athletic teams, which compete in the Northwest Conference.

==Mission==
The school prides itself in its Catholic identity. Its mission statement goes as follows: Lima Central Catholic will work with God's grace, the Church, and our families to form our students into thinkers, doers and saints in order to become tomorrow's servant leaders.
