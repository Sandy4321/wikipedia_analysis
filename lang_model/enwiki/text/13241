Since the 1980s, declines in [[amphibian]] populations, including [[population]] crashes and mass localized [[extinction]]s, have been noted  from locations all over the world. These declines are perceived as one of the most critical threats to global [[biodiversity]], and several causes are believed to be involved, including [[disease]], [[habitat destruction]] and modification, exploitation, [[pollution]], [[pesticide]] use, [[introduced species]], and [[ultraviolet-B]] radiation (UV-B). However, many of the causes of amphibian declines are still poorly understood, and the topic is currently a subject of much ongoing research. Calculations based on extinction rates suggest that the current extinction rate of amphibians could be 211 times greater than the [[background extinction rate]] and the estimate goes up to 25,000<U+2013>45,000 times if endangered species are also included in the computation.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=McCallum |first1= M.

== Background ==
{{wikinews|Largest mass extinction in 65 million years underway, scientists say}}
In the past three decades, declines in populations of amphibians (the [[Class (biology)|class]] of organisms that includes [[frogs]], [[toads]], [[salamanders]], [[newts]], and [[caecilians]]) have occurred worldwide. In 2004, the results were published of the first worldwide assessment of amphibian populations, the Global Amphibian Assessment. This found that 32% of species were globally threatened, at least 43% were experiencing some form of population decrease, and that between 9 and 122 species have become extinct since 1980.<ref name="stuart">{{cite journal |last1=Stuart |first1=Simon N. |last2=Chanson |first2=Janice S. |last3=Cox |first3=Neil A. |last4=Young |first4=Bruce E. |last5=Rodrigues |first5=Ana S.

Habitat loss, disease and climate change are thought to be responsible for the drastic decline in populations in recent years.<ref>{{cite web|title=Conservation International - Amphibians|url=http://www.conservation.org/learn/biodiversity/species/profiles/amphibians/Pages/overview.aspx|accessdate=8 August 2012}}</ref> 
Declines have been particularly intense in the western [[United States]], [[Central America]], [[South America]], eastern [[Australia]] and [[Fiji]] (although cases of amphibian extinctions have appeared worldwide). While human activities are causing a loss of much of the world<U+2019>s biodiversity, amphibians appear to be suffering much greater effects than other classes of organism. Because amphibians generally have a two-staged life cycle consisting of both [[aquatic animal|aquatic]] ([[larva]]e) and [[terrestrial animal|terrestrial]] ([[adult]]) phases, they are sensitive to both terrestrial and [[aquatic ecosystem|aquatic environmental]] effects.  Because their skins are highly permeable, they may be more susceptible to [[toxins]] in the environment than other organisms such as birds or mammals.<ref name="onethird">''Science Daily'' (October 15, 2004), [http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2004/10/041015103700.htm Amphibians in dramatic decline: Study finds nearly one third of species threatened with extinction]. Sciencedaily.com. Retrieved on September 18, 2007.</ref>  Many scientists believe that amphibians serve as "[[Animal sentinel#Historical examples|canaries in a coal mine]]," and that declines in amphibian populations and species indicate that other groups of animals and plants will soon be at risk.<ref name="onethird"/>

Declines in amphibian populations were first widely recognized in the late 1980s, when a large gathering of [[herpetology|herpetologists]] reported noticing declines in populations in amphibians across the globe.<ref name="blaustein">Blaustein, A.R. and D.B. Wake. 1990. Declining amphibian populations: a global phenomenon? ''Trends in Ecology and Evolution'' '''5''':203-204.</ref>  Among these species, the [[Golden toad]] (''Bufo periglenes'') [[Endemism|endemic]] to [[Monteverde]], [[Costa Rica]], featured prominently.  It was the subject of scientific research until populations suddenly crashed in 1987 and it had disappeared completely by 1989.<ref>Crump, M.L., F.R. Hensley, and K.I. Clark. 1992. Apparent decline of the golden toad: Underground or extinct? ''Copeia'' '''1992''':413-420.</ref> Other species at Monteverde, including the Monteverde Harlequin Frog (''[[Atelopus varius]]''), also disappeared at the same time. Because these species were located in the pristine Monteverde Cloud Forest Reserve, and these extinctions could not be related to local human activities, they raised particular concern among biologists.<ref>{{cite journal|author=J. Alan Pounds, Martha L. Crump|title=Amphibian Declines and Climate Disturbance: The Case of the Golden Toad and the Harlequin Frog|journal=Conservation Biology|volume=8|issue=1|pages=72<U+2013>85|year=1994|doi=10.1046/j.1523-1739.1994.08010072.x}}</ref>

== Initial skepticism ==
When amphibian declines were first presented as a conservation issue in the late 1980s, some scientists remained unconvinced of the reality and gravity of the conservation issue.<ref>Pechmann, J.H.K., D.E. Scott, R.D. Semlitsch, J.P. Caldwell, L.J. Vitt, and J.W. Gibbons. 1991. Declining amphibian populations: the problem of separating human impacts from natural fluctuations. ''Science'' '''253''':892-895.</ref> Some biologists argued that populations of most organisms, amphibians included, naturally vary through time.  They argued that the lack of long-term data on amphibian populations made it difficult to determine whether the anecdotal declines reported by biologists were worth the (often limited) time and money of conservation efforts.

However, since this initial scepticism, biologists have come to a consensus that declines in amphibian populations are a real and severe threat to biodiversity.<ref name="stuart" /> This consensus emerged with an increase in the number of studies that monitored amphibian populations, direct observation of mass mortality in pristine sites that lacked apparent cause, and an awareness that declines in amphibian populations are truly global in nature.<ref>Houlahan, J.E., C.S. Findlay, B.R. Schmidt, A.H. Meyer, and S.L. Kuzmin. 2000. Quantitative evidence for global amphibian population declines. ''Nature'' '''404''':752-758.</ref>

== Potential causes ==
Numerous potential explanations for amphibian declines have been proposed.  Most or all of these causes have been associated with some population declines, so each cause is likely to affect in certain circumstances but not others. Many of the causes of amphibian declines are well-understood, and appear to affect other groups of organisms as well as amphibians.  These causes include habitat modification and fragmentation, introduced predators or competitors, introduced species, pollution, pesticide use, or over-harvesting. However, many amphibian declines or extinctions have occurred in pristine habitats where the above effects are not likely to occur.  The causes of these declines are complex, but many can be attributed to emerging diseases, climate change, increased ultraviolet-B radiation, or long-distance transmission of chemical contaminants by wind. 

Artificial lighting has been suggested as another potential cause. Insects are attracted to lights making them scarcer within the amphibian habitats.<ref>Eisenbeis, G., 2006. Artificial night lighting and insects: Attraction of insects to streetlamps in a rural setting in Germany. In C. Rich & T. Longcore (eds), Ecological Consequences of Artificial Night Lighting.

=== Habitat modification ===
{{Main|Habitat destruction}}
[[Habitat]] modification or destruction is one of the most dramatic issues affecting amphibian species worldwide. As amphibians generally need aquatic and terrestrial habitats to survive, threats to either habitat can affect populations. Hence, amphibians may be more vulnerable to habitat modification than organisms that only require one habitat type. Large scale climate changes may further be modifying aquatic habitats, preventing amphibians from spawning altogether.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/7693381.stm | work=BBC News | title=Climate link to amphibian decline | date=2008-10-27 | accessdate=2010-05-01}}</ref>

=== Habitat fragmentation ===
{{Main|Habitat fragmentation}}
Habitat fragmentation occurs when habitats are isolated by habitat modification, such as when a small area of forest is completely surrounded by agricultural fields.  Small populations that survive within such fragments are often susceptible to [[inbreeding]], [[genetic drift]], or extinction due to small fluctuations in the environment.

=== Pollution and chemical contaminants ===
There is evidence of chemical [[pollutant]]s causing frog developmental deformities (extra limbs, or malformed eyes).<ref>{{cite journal|title=The complexity of deformed amphibians|author=Blaustein, Andrew R & Pieter TJ Johnson|journal=Front.

While most pesticide effects are likely to be local and restricted to areas near agriculture, there is evidence from the [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada]] mountains of the western United States that pesticides are traveling long distances into pristine areas, including [[Yosemite National Park]] in [[California]].<ref>{{cite journal|author=Grossi, Mark |title=Sierra Frogs Fall Silent|journal=The Fresno Bee|date=24 July 2001|url = http://www.yosemite.org/newsroom/clips2001/July/072401.html|accessdate=2008-10-02|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070618083908/http://www.yosemite.org/newsroom/clips2001/July/072401.html |archivedate = June 18, 2007|deadurl=yes}}</ref>

Some recent evidence points to [[ozone]] as a possible contributing factor to the worldwide decline of amphibians.<ref>Dohm, M.R., et al. 2005.

=== Ozone depletion, ultraviolet radiation and cloud cover ===

Salamanders and frogs that produce less [[photolyase]], an enzyme that counteracts DNA damage from UVB, are more susceptible to the effects of loss of the ozone layer. Exposure to ultraviolet radiation may not kill a particular species or life stage but may cause sublethal damage.

More than three dozen species of amphibians have been studied, with severe effects reported in more than 40 publications in peer-reviewed journals representing authors from North America, Europe and Australia. Experimental enclosure approaches to determine UVB effects on egg stages have been criticized; for example, egg masses were placed at water depths much shallower than is typical for natural oviposition sites.  While UVB radiation is an important stressor for amphibians,<ref>Bancroft, B.A. et al. 2007. Effects of UVB radiation on marine and freshwater organisms: a synthesis through meta-analysis.

=== Disease ===
A number of diseases have been related to mass die-offs or declines in populations of amphibians, including "red-leg" disease (''[[Aeromonas hydrophila]]''), ''[[Ranavirus]]'' (family [[Iridoviridae]]), ''[[Anuraperkinsus]]'', and [[chytridiomycosis]]. It is not entirely clear why these diseases have suddenly begun to affect amphibian populations, but some evidence suggests that these diseases may have been spread by humans, or may be more virulent when combined with other environmental factors.<ref name=Daszaketal1999>{{cite journal|last=Daszak,|first=Peter|author2=Lee Berger |author3=Andrew A.

There is considerable evidence that parasitic [[trematode]] [[platyhelminth]]s (a type of [[Trematoda|fluke]]) have contributed to developmental abnormalities and population declines of amphibians in some regions.<ref>Johnson, P.T.J., and J.M. Chase. 2004. Parasites in the food web: linking amphibian malformations and aquatic eutrophication. ''Ecology Letters'' '''7''':521-526.</ref>  These trematodes of the genus ''[[Ribeiroia]]'' have a complex life cycle with three host species.  The first host includes a number of species of aquatic snails.  The early larval stages of the trematodes then are transmitted into aquatic tadpoles, where the metacercariae (larvae) encyst in developing limb buds.  These encysted life stages produce developmental abnormalities in post-metamorphic frogs, including additional or missing limbs.<ref name="blaustein" />  These abnormalities increase frog predation by aquatic birds, the final host of the trematode.

A study showed that high levels of nutrients used in farming and ranching activities fuel parasite infections that have caused frog deformities in ponds and lakes across North America. The study showed increased levels of nitrogen and phosphorus cause sharp hikes in the abundance of trematodes, and that the parasites subsequently form cysts in the developing limbs of tadpoles causing missing limbs, extra limbs and other severe malformations including five or six extra or even no limbs.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Aquatic eutrophication promotes pathogenic infection in amphibians|doi=10.1073/pnas.0707763104|year=2007|volume=104|issue=40  |pages=15781<U+2013>15786|author=Johnson PTJ, Jonathan M.

Subsequent research has established that the fungus has been present in Australia since at least 1978, and present in North America since at least the 1970s.  The first known record of chytrid infection in frogs is in the African Clawed Frog, ''[[Xenopus laevis]]''.
Because ''Xenopus'' are sold in pet shops and used in laboratories around the world, it is possible that the chytrid fungus may have been exported from Africa.<ref name="Weldon et al 2004">{{cite journal|last=Weldon|first=Ch<U+00E9>|coauthors=du Preez, Louis H.; Hyatt, Alex D.; Muller, Reinhold; Speare, Rick|title=Origin of the Amphibian Chytrid Fungus|journal=Emerging Infectious Diseases|year=2004|volume=10|issue=12|pages=2100<U+2013>2105|doi=10.3201/eid1012.030804|url=http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/10/12/03-0804_article.htm}}</ref>

=== Introduced predators ===
{{Main|Introduced species}}
Non-native predators and competitors have also been found to affect the viability of frogs in their habitats.  The [[mountain yellow-legged frog]] which typically inhabits the [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada]] lakes have seen a decline in numbers due to stocking of non-native fish ([[trout]]) for recreational [[fishing]].  The developing tadpoles and froglets fall prey to the fish in large numbers. This interference in the frog's three-year [[Metamorphosis (biology)|metamorphosis]] is causing a decline that is manifest throughout their ecosystem.<ref>Knapp, R. A., and K. R. Matthews. 2000. Non-native fish introductions and the decline of the mountain yellow-legged frog from within protected areas. Conservation Biology. 14:428-438.</ref>

=== Increased noise levels ===
Frogs and toads are highly vocal, and their reproductive behaviour often involves the use of vocalizations. There have been suggestions that increased noise levels caused by human activities may be contributing to their declines. In a study in Thailand, increased [[ambient noise level]]s were shown to decrease calling in some species and to cause an increase in others.<ref name="Anthropogenic sounds">{{cite journal|last=Sun|first=Jennifer W.C.|author2=Narins, Peter M.|title=Anthropogenic sounds differentially affect amphibian call rate|journal=Biological Conservation|year=2005|volume=121|issue=3|pages=419<U+2013>427|doi=10.1016/j.biocon.2004.05.017|url=https://www.ibp.ucla.edu/Faculty/Narins/publications/pdfs/Sun%20and%20Narins%20BC.pdf}}</ref>  This has, however, not been shown to be a cause for the widespread decline.

== Symptoms of stressed amphibian populations ==
Amphibian populations in the beginning stages of decline often exude a number of signs, which may potentially be used to identify at-risk segments in conservation efforts.  One such sign is developmental instability, which has been proven as evidence of environmental stress.<ref name=Alfordetal2007>{{cite journal|last=Alford|first=Ross A.|author2=Bradfield, Kay S. |author3=Richards, Stephen J. |title=Ecology: Global warming and amphibian losses|journal=Nature|year=2007|volume=447|issue=7144|pages=E3<U+2013>E4|doi=10.1038/nature05940|url=http://eprints.jcu.edu.au/16656/1/16656.pdf|pmid=17538571}}</ref>   This environmental stress can potentially raise susceptibility to diseases such as chytridiomycosis, and thus lead to amphibian declines.  In a study conducted in [[Queensland]], Australia, for example, populations of two amphibian species, ''[[Litoria nannotis]]'' and ''[[Litoria genimaculata]]'', were found to exhibit far greater levels of limb asymmetry in pre-decline years than in control years, the latter of which preceded die offs by an average of 16 years.{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}}  Learning to identify such signals in the critical period before population declines occur might greatly improve conservation efforts.

== Conservation measures ==
{{See also|Amphibian Ark}}
On 16 February 2007, scientists worldwide met in [[Atlanta]], [[United States|U.S.]], to form a group called the [[Amphibian Ark]] to help save more than 6,000 species of amphibians from disappearing by starting [[captive breeding]] programmes.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.thestandard.com.hk/news_detail.asp?we_cat=9&art_id=38447&sid=12249536&con_type=1&d_str=20070216 | title = Bid to save frogs from killer goes worldwide | language =  | accessdate = 2007-02-22 | year = 2007}}</ref>

Conservation efforts have been created by several organizations such as Amphibian Conservation Alliance (ACA) and the World Wildlife Fund to help further studies on frog extinction and educate people on the issue at hand. 

Areas with noticed frog extinctions, like Australia, have few policies that have been created to prevent the extinction of these species.  However, local initiatives have been placed where conscious efforts to decrease global warming will also turn into a conscious effort towards saving the frogs. In South America, where there is also an increased decline of amphibian populations, there is no set policy to try to save frogs. Some suggestions would include getting entire governments to place a set of rules and institutions as a source of guidelines that local governments have to abide by.<ref>[http://www.frogs.org/index.asp ]{{dead link|date=May 2013}}</ref><ref>[http://www.denverzoo.org/conservation/project46 ]{{dead link|date=May 2013}}</ref>
