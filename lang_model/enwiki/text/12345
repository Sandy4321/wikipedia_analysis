==Biography==
[[File:Bujold2012.png|thumb| Bujold at [[Finncon]] 2012 in [[Tampere]] ]]
Bujold is the daughter of Robert Charles McMaster<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dendarii.com/tribute.html |title=Robert Charles McMaster - a tribute |publisher=Dendarii.com |date= |accessdate=2014-01-28}}</ref><ref>cf. a [http://www.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=1384&page=266 Memorial Tribute] in his honor</ref> and attributes her early interest in science fiction, as well as certain aspects of the [[Vorkosigan Saga]], to his influence. He was editor<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.amazon.com/dp/0318215020 |title=Nondestructive Testing Handbook (9780318215020): Robert C. McMaster: Books |publisher=Amazon.com |date= |accessdate=2014-01-28}}</ref> of the monumental ''Nondestructive Testing Handbook''<ref>[http://www.asnt.org/publications/handbook/third/thirdedition.htm The American Society for Nondestructive Testing]{{dead link|date=January 2014}}</ref> generally referred to as ''McMaster on Materials''.

Bujold writes that her experience growing up with a world-famous father is reflected in the same experience that her characters (Miles, Fiametta) have of growing up in the shadow of a "[[Great Man theory|Great Man]]".  Having observed this tendency in both genders, she wonders why it is always called "great man's son syndrome", and never "great man's daughter's syndrome."<ref>{{cite book|last=Bujold|first=Lois Mcmaster|title=Young Miles|year=1997|publisher=BAEN|page=830}}</ref> Her brother, an engineer like their father, helped provide technical details to support her writing of ''[[Falling Free]]''.<ref>Bujold, Lois McMaster.  Forward to Miles, Mutants, Microbes Omnibus edition, paragraphs 11 & 13</ref>

She became a member of [[science fiction fandom]], joined the [[Central Ohio Science Fiction Society]], and co-published ''StarDate'', a [[science fiction fanzine]] in which a story of hers appeared under the byline Lois McMaster.

Bujold currently lives in [[Minnesota]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dendarii.com/biolog.html |title=Lois McMaster Bujold, Biolog |publisher=Dendarii.com |date= |accessdate=2014-01-28}}</ref> She is divorced and has two children.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dendarii.com/locus.html |title=Locus Lois McMaster Bujold Biography |publisher=Dendarii.com |date= |accessdate=2014-01-28}}</ref>

==Science fiction==
Lois Bujold wrote three books (''[[Shards of Honor]]'', ''[[The Warrior's Apprentice]]'' and ''[[Ethan of Athos]]'') before ''[[The Warrior's Apprentice]]'' was accepted after four rejections. ''The Warrior's Apprentice'' was the first book purchased, though not the first Vorkosigan book written, nor would it be the first one to be published.  On the strength of ''The Warrior's Apprentice'', [[Baen Books]] agreed to a three-book deal to include the two bracketing novels. Thus began her career in writing in science fiction. By 2010 [[Baen Books]] claimed to have sold 2 million copies of Bujold's books.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://clarkesworldmagazine.com/bujold_interview/|title=A Conversation With Lois McMaster Bujold| author=Jeremy L. C. Jones| publisher=[[Clarkesworld Magazine]]| accessdate=2012-04-01}}</ref>

Bujold is best known for her Vorkosigan saga, a series of novels featuring [[Miles Vorkosigan]], a physically impaired interstellar [[spy]] and [[mercenary]] admiral from the planet [[List of Vorkosigan Saga planets#Barrayar|Barrayar]], set approximately 1000 years in the future. Earlier titles are generally firmly in the [[space opera]] tradition with no shortage of battles, conspiracies, and wild twists, while in more recent volumes, Miles becomes more of a [[detective fiction|detective]]. In ''[[A Civil Campaign]]'', Bujold explores yet another genre: a high-society romance with a plot that pays tribute to [[Regency romance]] novelist [[Georgette Heyer]] (as acknowledged in the dedication). It centers on a catastrophic dinner party, with misunderstandings and dialogue justifying the subtitle "A Comedy of Biology and Manners".

The author has stated that the series structure is modeled after the [[Horatio Hornblower]] books, documenting the life of a single person. In themes and echoes, they also reflect [[Dorothy L. Sayers]]' mystery character [[Lord Peter Wimsey]].  Bujold has also said that part of the challenge of writing a series is that many readers will encounter the stories in "utterly random order", so she must provide sufficient background in each of them without being excessively repetitious. Most recent printings of her Vorkosigan tales do include an appendix at the end summarizing the internal chronology of the series.

Bujold has discussed her own views on the optimum reading order for the Vorkosigan series in her blog.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.myspace.com/loismcmasterbujold/blog/543224694 |title=The chef recommends| author=Lois McMaster Bujold| publisher=[[Myspace]]| accessdate=2011-10-27}}</ref>

==Fantasy==
Bujold also wanted to break into the fantasy genre, but met with early setbacks. Her first foray into fantasy was ''[[The Spirit Ring]]''. She wrote the book "on spec", shopped it around, and found low offers, sending her back to [[Baen Books]], where [[Jim Baen]] bought it for a fair price in exchange for the promise of more Vorkosigan books. Bujold called this experience, combined with the mediocre sales and lack of critical acclaim of that book, very educational.

She would not attempt to break into the fantasy market again for almost another decade, with ''[[The Curse of Chalion]]''. This book was also written on spec and offered up to a book auction.  This time, she met with considerable critical and commercial success by tapping into a crossover market of fantasy and romance genre fans.  The fantasy world of [[Chalion]] was first conceived as a result of a [[University of Minnesota]] course she was taking about [[Medieval Spain]] in her spare time.

The next fantasy world she created was the [[tetralogy]] set in the universe of ''[[The Sharing Knife]]'' borrowing inspiration for its landscapes from ones she grew up with in central Ohio.  She writes that her first readers who helped proof-read it said she got it exactly right and they could recognize Ohio features in the descriptions and [[dialect]]s.  She states that the dialect of the "farmers" is one she grew up around.
