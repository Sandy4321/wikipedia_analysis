Dvo<U+0159><U+00E1>k's [[Symphony No. 6 (Dvo<U+0159><U+00E1>k)|Symphony No. 6 in D minor]] had a troubled birth.  He dedicated it to [[Hans Richter (conductor)|Hans Richter]], who had commissioned it, and he asked Richter to premiere it with the [[Vienna Philharmonic]] in late December 1880.  However, events in Richter's personal life and anti-Czech sentiment in Vienna, combined with the fact that Dvo<U+0159><U+00E1>k was virtually unknown there (none of his symphonies had been published at this time), caused its continual postponement. Dvo<U+0159><U+00E1>k responded by asking Adolf <U+010C>ech to premiere the symphony in Prague on 25 March 1881.  Vienna did not see it until 1883, and not under Richter.  Richter conducted it many times, but never in Vienna.<ref>[http://books.google.com.au/books?id=lozBiI1ehiIC&pg=PA137&lpg=PA137&dq=adolf+cech&source=bl&ots=m1Q0NOpFFo&sig=nLTykMmGXB1WUmpFBr-RHZ7dxMc&hl=en&sa=X&ei=h1pyUaudNMWeiQfQ04DYDw&ved=0CDYQ6AEwAjgK#v=onepage&q=cech&f=false Michael Steinberg, ''The Symphony: A Listener's Guide'']</ref><ref name=challenge/><ref name=cincin/><ref>[http://www.naxos.com/mainsite/blurbs_reviews.asp?item_code=8.572698&catNum=572698&filetype=About%20this%20Recording&language=English Naxos]</ref><ref>[http://www.kennedy-center.org/calendar/?fuseaction=composition&composition_id=3144 Kennedy Center]</ref>
