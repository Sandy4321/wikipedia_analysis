The '''one-armed bandit murder''' was a criminal case in the [[North East England|north east of England]]. The case involved the murder of Angus Sibbet in 1967. The following trial resulted in [[life sentence]]s for Dennis Stafford and Michael Luvaglio. Both men were released on licence 12 years later.

==Notoriety==
The case gained the nickname in the press as the "One-armed bandit murder",<ref name="ind27Jun06"/><ref name="BBC31Jan02"/><ref name="nehist"/> through the connection to the [[gambling|gaming]] industry, involving the supply of [[fruit machines]], also known colloquially as ''one armed bandits'', to social clubs.

The case was one of the most notorious killings in the north east,<ref name="BBC31Jan02"/><ref name="NEcho12Apr04"/> and the first gangland killing sparking fears that [[organised crime]] was gaining a foothold in the north east.<ref name="nehist"/> Luvaglio's [[Italian language|Italian]] surname sparked the headline "[[Mafia|The Mafia]] are coming."<ref name="nehist"/> The trial was one of the biggest seen in the north east.<ref name="nehist"/>

Both men have always insisted on their innocence,<ref name="ind27Jun06"/><ref name="BBC31Jan02"/><ref name="BBC28May2002"/> with Stafford alleging the murder was committed by a [[Scottish people|Scottish]] gangster<ref name="ind27Jun06"/><ref name="BBC28May2002"/> and Luvaglio alleging it was part of a failed attempt by the Krays to enter the Newcastle club scene.<ref name="ind27Jun06"/><ref name="nehist"/>

The pair have claimed that the hype surrounding the case and the upsurge in gangland activity caused the police to suppress evidence in order to gain a conviction.<ref name="dm6Apr08"/> Luvaglio says that he was charged as Stafford's companion because, in his initial questioning, he refused to say that Stafford had left him on the night of the murder.<ref name="nehist"/> Had Luvaglio made this statement, it was likely only Stafford would have been charged and convicted.<ref name="SEcho28Mar80"/><ref>See website [http://www.villain-or-victim.com www.villain-or-victim.com]</ref>

==Background==
Organised crime was on the rise in Britain during the 1960s, with the most notable events being the gangland wars between [[Kray twins|the Krays]] and [[the Richardson Gang]].

Sibbet was a money collector for a company run by Luvaglio's brother which supplied working men's clubs with fruit machines.<ref name="nehist"/> The company supplied the entire north east representing a lucrative business for underworld gangs.<ref name="SEcho28Mar80"/>

Sibbet, Luvaglio and Stafford were all friends and business associates.<ref name="NEcho12Apr04"/><ref name="SEcho28Mar80"/> Luvaglio was a [[London]]er with [[Italian people|Italian]] roots<ref name="nehist"/> who had moved from London to Newcastle to work in his brother's business.<ref name="ind27Jun06"/> Stafford, also from London,<ref name="dm6Apr08"/> was a self-confessed "playboy"<ref name="SEcho28Mar80"/> and career criminal,<ref name="dm6Apr08"/> whereas Luvaglio was less involved in crime and was not inclined to violence.<ref name="SEcho28Mar80"/> Luvaglio asserted that Sibbet was a very good friend of his,<ref name="BBC31Jan02"/> even his best friend<ref name="BBC31Jan02"/> or like a brother.<ref name="nehist"/>

==Murder==
On the night of 4 January 1967, Luvaglio and Stafford were to meet Sibbet at the Birdcage club in Newcastle at 12.30am,<ref name="NEcho12Apr04"/> 16 miles away from the eventual scene of discovery of Sibbet's body.<ref name="ind27Jun06"/><ref name="NEcho12Apr04"/>

Sibbet's body was discovered the following morning at 5.15am by a miner<ref name="ind27Jun06"/> in the back seat<ref name="BBC31Jan02"/><ref name="NEcho12Apr04"/> of his Jaguar, having been shot three times.<ref name="dm6Apr08">[http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-557457/Ill-prove-I-framed-says-gangster-jailed-Get-Carter-murder.html Daily Mail online] I'll prove I was framed says gangster jailed for Get Carter murder, 6 April 2008</ref> The car was under Pesspool Bridge in [[South Hetton]], [[County Durham]].<ref name="BBC28May2002"/>

==Trial==
The trial took place at [[Newcastle Crown Court]] two months later.<ref name="nehist"/>

As motive for his murder, the prosecution alleged Sibbet had been skimming the takings,<ref name="nehist"/><ref name="BBC28May2002"/> estimated as [[<U+00A3>]]1,000 a week,<ref name="ind27Jun06"/><ref name="dm6Apr08"/> supported by the fact he could afford to buy a [[Jaguar Mark X|Jaguar Mark 10]].<ref name="ind27Jun06"/>

Stafford and Luvaglio were both found guilty, and were sentenced to life in prison.<ref name="ind27Jun06"/><ref name="nehist"/><ref name="NEcho12Apr04"/>

==Release and appeals==
The pair were released from prison in 1979, freed on license after serving 12 years,<ref name="BBC28May2002"/> after two failed [[appeal]]s while in prison.<ref name="ind27Jun06">[http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/man-convicted-of-get-carter-killing-blames-kray-twins-405679.html The Independent] Man convicted of 'Get Carter' killing blames Kray twins</ref><ref name="SEcho28Mar80"/>

The main doubts about the original trial surround the asserted time of death,<ref name="ind27Jun06"/><ref name="BBC31Jan02"/><ref name="nehist"/><ref name="NEcho12Apr04"/><ref name="BBC28May2002"/> proving which was key as the pair had alibis for all but a 45-minute window on the night, and the time of death had to be estimated as the body was only discovered at 5 am; the time was at least five hours prior, according to police.<ref name="BBC31Jan02"/> Witnesses were reported to have seen Sibbet alive in the car after the time of death,<ref name="BBC31Jan02">[http://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/pressreleases/stories/2002/01_january/31/michaelluvaglio.shtml BBC Press Office] 31 Jan 2002</ref> or nobody in the car.<ref name="NEcho12Apr04"/>

Doubts were also expressed over the lack of any [[forensic evidence]] linking the pair to the scene,<ref name="nehist">[http://www.theclarion.co.uk/the_north_east/history/crime/sibbet.html www.theclarion.co.uk] 'I don't want to die a convicted killer'</ref><ref name="NEcho12Apr04"/>
the actual presence of conflicting forensic evidence,<ref name="ind27Jun06"/><ref name="nehist"/><ref name="NEcho12Apr04">[http://archive.thenorthernecho.co.uk/2004/4/12/56033.html The Northern Echo] A matter of conviction, 12 April 2004</ref> and over the relevance of contradictory withheld evidence and witness statements<ref name="ind27Jun06"/><ref name="NEcho12Apr04"/><ref name="SEcho28Mar80"/> and missing evidence.<ref name="NEcho12Apr04"/>

In 2002, it was asserted by Stafford's legal team that a murder conviction on the evidence would not have been possible in modern times,<ref name="BBC28May2002"/> and the case was taken to the Criminal Cases Review Commission<ref name="BBC28May2002"/> which opened a review of the case in 2005.<ref name="ind27Jun06"/> This later failed,<ref name="SEcho28Mar80"/> as did an appeal in the [[House of Lords]].<ref name="SEcho28Mar80"/>

Stafford was re-imprisoned for two years in 1989<ref name="ind27Jun06"/><ref name="BBC28May2002"/> after breaching his license by leaving the country, in the meantime setting up in business in [[South Africa]]. He was arrested after re-entering the country and being caught in a security check at a hotel where [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] was staying.<ref name="ind27Jun06"/><ref name="BBC28May2002"/>

Both Stafford and Luvaglio had been fighting their cases on a separate basis, not speaking to each other since their original release.<ref name="SEcho28Mar80"/> This was down to the separate backgrounds of the two men, and not due to any falling out.<ref name="SEcho28Mar80"/> However, a reunion was held after 30 years in March 2008, when they embarked on a Judicial Review at the High Court.<ref name="SEcho28Mar80">[http://www.sunderlandecho.com/news/Sibbett-murder-convicts-to-meet.3926298.jp Sunderland Echo] Sibbett murder convicts to meet after 30 years, 28 March 2008</ref> This failed, leaving the only recourse an appeal to [[Europe]].

==Stafford parole judgement==
Stafford was later imprisoned for forging [[traveller's cheque]]s in 1994.<ref name="BBC28May2002">[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/2012084.stm Chequered career of 'human rights' convict] BBC News, 28 May 2002</ref> Then [[Home Secretary]] [[Michael Howard]] kept him jailed overruling a [[parole]] board recommendation. This decision was later challenged in a landmark ruling at the [[European Court of Human Rights]] and in May 2002 the Court ruled that home secretaries had no power to overrule the parole board's decision<ref name="BBC28May2002"/><ref name="SEcho28Mar80"/> and awarded damages.

==Popular culture==
The song "5:15 am" by [[Mark Knopfler]] from his 2004 album ''[[Shangri-La_(Mark_Knopfler_album)|Shangri-La]]'' tells the story of the one-armed bandit murder and reflects on its effect on the community.
