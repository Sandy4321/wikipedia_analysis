The '''blacknose shark''', ''Carcharhinus acronotus'', is a species of [[requiem shark]], family Carcharhinidae, common in the tropical and subtropical waters of the western [[Atlantic Ocean]]. This species generally inhabits coastal [[seagrass]], sand, or rubble [[habitat]]s, with adults preferring deeper water than juveniles. A small shark typically measuring 1.3 m (4.1 ft) long, the blacknose shark has a typical streamlined "requiem shark" shape with a long rounded snout, large eyes, and a small first [[dorsal fin]]. Its [[common name]] comes from a characteristic black blotch on the tip of its snout, though this may be indistinct in older individuals.

Blacknose sharks feed primarily on small [[bony fish]]es and [[cephalopod]]s, and in turn fall prey to larger sharks. Like other members of their family, they exhibit a [[viviparous]] mode of reproduction in which the developing [[embryo]]s are sustained by a [[placenta]]l connection. The females give birth to 3&ndash;6 young in late spring or early summer either annually or biennually, after a [[gestation period]] of 8&ndash;11 months. This species is not known to [[shark attack|attack]] humans, though it has been documented performing a [[shark threat display|threat display]] towards divers. It is of moderate [[commercial fishing|commercial]] and [[recreational fishing|recreational]] importance. The conservation status of this species has not been assessed by the [[World Conservation Union]]; a 2002 regional assessment by the SouthEast Data, Assessment, and Review (SEDAR) group suggested that populations off the southeastern [[United States]] are not currently [[overfishing|overfished]].

==Taxonomy and phylogeny==
The [[Cuba]]n naturalist [[Felipe Poey]] published the first description of the blacknose shark in 1860 as ''Squalus acronotus'', in his ''Memorias sobre la historia natural de la Isla de Cuba''. The name was later changed to the currently valid ''Carcharhinus acronotus''. The [[type specimen]] was a 98&nbsp;cm (3.2 ft) long male from Cuba.<ref name="compagno">{{cite book |author=Compagno, L.J.V. |date=1984 |title=Sharks of the World: An Annotated and Illustrated Catalogue of Shark Species Known to Date |place=Rome |publisher=Food and Agricultural Organization |isbn=9251013845 |pages=454&ndash;455}}</ref> A 2008 [[phylogenetics|phylogenetic analysis]] based on [[ribosomal DNA]], conducted by Mine Dosay-Akbulut, suggested that the blacknose shark is closely related to the [[blacktip shark]] (''C. limbatus'').<ref>{{cite journal |author=Dosay-Akbulut, M. |date=2008 |title=The phylogenetic relationship within the genus ''Carcharhinus'' |journal=Comptes Rendus Biologies |volume=331 |pages=500&ndash;509}}</ref>

==Distribution and habitat==
The blacknose shark inhabits the continental and insular shelves off the eastern coast of the [[Americas]], as far north as [[North Carolina]] and as far south as southern [[Brazil]], including the [[Bahamas]], the [[Gulf of Mexico]], and the [[Caribbean Sea]]. They frequent coastal waters over beds of seagrass, sandy flats, and shell or [[coral]] rubble.<ref name="stafford-deitsch">{{cite book |title=Sharks of Florida, the Bahamas, the Caribbean and the Gulf of Mexico |author=Stafford-Deitsch, J. |publisher=Trident Press |date=2000 |isbn=1900724456 |page=68}}</ref> This species is spatially segregated by size and sex.

==Description==
[[Image:Carcharhinus acronotus drawing.jpg|thumb|240px|left|Illustration of a blacknose shark and its tooth]]
The blacknose shark has a slender, streamlined body with a long, rounded snout and large eyes. There is a well-developed flap of skin in front of each [[nostril]], defining the incurrent and excurrent openings. There are 12&ndash;13 and 11&ndash;12 tooth rows on either side of the upper and lower jaws respectively, with 1&ndash;2 teeth at the [[symphysis]] (middle). The teeth are triangular and oblique, with serrated edges; the upper teeth are stouter than the lower teeth. The five pairs of [[gill slit]]s are short, measuring less a third the length of the first dorsal fin base.<ref name="bester"/><ref name="mceachran and fechhelm">{{cite book |title=Fishes of the Gulf of Mexico: Myxiniformes to Gasterosteiformes |author=McEachran, J.D. and Fechhelm, J.D. |publisher=University of Texas Press |date=1998 |isbn=0292752067 |page=74}}</ref>

The first dorsal fin is small and somewhat falcate (sickle-shaped), with a pointed apex and a short free rear tip; its origin lies over the free rear tips of the [[pectoral fin]]s. The second dorsal fin is relatively large, though still less than half the height of the first. There is no ridge between the dorsal fins. The pectoral fins are short and tapered.<ref name="mceachran and fechhelm"/> The body is covered with overlapping [[dermal denticle]]s that bear 5&ndash;7 longitudinal ridges leading to marginal teeth.<ref name="bester"/> The coloration is yellowish to greenish gray or brown above and white to yellow below. There is a distinctive dark blotch at the tip of the snout that is most obvious in young sharks. The tips of the second dorsal fin, upper [[caudal fin]] lobe, and sometimes the lower caudal fin lobe, are dark. Blacknose sharks are typically 1.3&ndash;1.4 m (4.1&ndash;4.6 ft) long and 10 kg (22 lb) in weight.<ref name="compagno"/><ref name="mceachran and fechhelm"/> The maximum recorded length is 2.0 m (6.6 ft), and the maximum recorded weight 18.9 kg (42 lb).<ref name="fishbase">{{fishbase species |genus=Carcharhinus |species=acronotus |month=June |year=2009}}</ref>

==Biology and ecology==
A small, fast-swimming predator, the blacknose shark feeds primarily on small bony fishes, including [[pinfish]], [[Sciaenidae|croakers]], [[Sparidae|porgies]], [[anchovies]], [[Ostraciidae|spiny boxfish]], and [[porcupinefish]], as well as on [[octopus]] and other cephalopods.<ref name="bester"/> When competing for bait, their speed allows them to snatch food from larger sharks such as the [[Caribbean reef shark]] (''C. perezi'').<ref>{{cite book |title=The Shark Chronicles: A Scientist Tracks the Consummate Predator |author=Musick, J.A. and McMillan, B. |publisher=Macmillan |date=2003 |pages=57&ndash;59 |isbn=0805073590}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |title=Shark: Stories of Life and Death from the World's Most Dangerous Waters |author=May, N. and Willis, C. |publisher=Thunder's Mouth Press |date=2002 |page=192 |isbn=1560253975}}</ref> This species may form large [[shoaling and schooling|school]]s that are sometimes associated with anchovies and [[mullet (fish)|mullet]].<ref name="bester"/> Blacknose sharks demonstrate a high degree of [[philopatry]]: both juveniles and adults have been documented returning to the same local area year after year.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Hueter, R.E., Heupel, M.R., Heist, E.J., and Keeney, D.B. |date=2005 |title=Evidence of Philopatry in Sharks and Implications for the Management of Shark Fisheries |journal=Journal of Northwestern Atlantic Fishery Science |volume=35 |pages=239&ndash;247}}</ref>

Blacknose sharks are preyed upon by larger sharks.<ref name="bester"/> Captive blacknose sharks have been observed to perform an apparent [[shark threat display|threat display]] towards encroaching divers or newly introduced members of their species. The display consists of the shark hunching its back, lowering its pectoral fins, gaping its jaws, and swimming with an exaggerated side-to-side motion.<ref name="compagno"/><ref>{{cite journal |author=Martin, R.A. |title=A review of shark agonistic displays: comparison of display features and implications for shark-human interactions |journal=Marine and Freshwater Behaviour and Physiology |date=March 2007 |volume=40 |issue=1 |pages=3&ndash;34}}</ref> Known [[parasite]]s of this species include the [[copepod]]s ''Nesippus orientalis'', ''Perissopus dentatus'', ''Pandarus sinuatus'', ''Kroyeria sphyrnae'', ''Nemesis atlantica'', and ''Eudactylina spinifera'',<ref>{{cite journal |author=Cressey, R.F. |title=Copepods Parasitic on Sharks From the West Coast of Florida |journal=Smithsonian Contributions to Biology |volume=38 |date=1970 |pages=1&ndash;30}}</ref> as well as [[tapeworm]]s in the genera ''Paraorygmatobothrium'' and ''Platybothrium''.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Ruhnke, T.R. and Thompson, V.A. |title=Two New Species of ''Paraorygmatobothrium'' (Tetraphyllidea: Phyllobothriidae) from the Lemon Sharks ''Negaprion brevirostris'' and ''Negaprion acutidens'' (Carcharhiniformes: Carcharhinidae) |journal=Comparative Parasitology |volume=73 |issue=1 |pages=35&ndash;41 |date=2006}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Healy, C.J. |title=A revision of ''Platybothrium'' Linton, 1890 (Tetraphyllidea: Onchobothriidae), with a phylogenetic analysis and comments on host-parasite associations |journal=Systematic Parasitology |volume=56 |pages=85&ndash;139 |date=2003}}</ref>

===Life history===
As in other requiem sharks, the blacknose shark is viviparous: after the developing embryos exhaust their supply of [[yolk]], the empty [[yolk sac]] develops into a placental connection through which the mother provides nourishment. Males are thought to reproduce every year while females reproduce every other year.<ref name="driggers et al">{{cite journal |author=Driggers, W.B. (III), Oakley, D.A., Ulrich, G., Carlson, J.K., Cullum, B.J. and Dean, J.M. |title=Reproductive biology of ''Carcharhinus acronotus'' in the coastal waters of South Carolina |journal=Journal of Fish Biology |volume=64 |issue=6 |pages=1540&ndash;1551}}</ref> However, based on studies of blacknose sharks off northeastern Brazil, Hazin ''et al.'' (2002) proposed that the female reproductive cycle is short enough to occur annually.<ref name="hazin et al">{{cite journal |author=Hazin, F.H.V., Oliveira, P.G. and Broadhurst, M.K. |title=Reproduction of the blacknose shark (''Carcharhinus acronotus'') in coastal waters off northeastern Brazil |journal=Fishery Bulletin |volume=100 |pages=143<U+2013>148 |date=2002}}</ref> [[Vitellogenesis]] (the formation of yolk within the [[ovary]]) occurs in the late summer, and is immediately followed by [[mating]] and [[fertilization]] in the fall, with the young being born the following spring to summer.<ref name="bester"/> The seasonality of these events means that the reproductive cycle is offset by six months between populations in the Northern and Southern Hemispheres. The [[gestation period]] has been variously estimated at 8 months off northeastern Brazil and 9 or 10&ndash;11 months off the southeastern United States.<ref name="hazin et al"/>

Females typically give birth to litters of 3&ndash;6 pups in shallow nursery areas such as coastal bays or [[mangrove swamp]]s;<ref name="ferrari and ferrari">{{cite book |author=Ferrari, A. and Ferrari, A. |title=Sharks |publisher=Firefly Books |page=157 |isbn=1552096297}}</ref> one known nursery area is Bulls Bay off [[South Carolina]].<ref name="bester"/> There is no relationship between female size and the number of young.<ref name="sedar"/> The newborns measure 38&ndash;50 cm (15&ndash;20 in) long.<ref name="compagno"/> Female blacknose sharks grow more slowly, attain a larger ultimate size, and have a longer lifespan than males.

==Human interactions==
The blacknose shark has never been implicated in an attack on humans. However, caution should be exercised if it begins to perform a threat display.<ref name="ferrari and ferrari"/> This species is regarded as a [[game fish]] and offers a respectable fight on [[fishing tackle|light tackle]].<ref name="bester"/> It is also of regional commercial importance, being taken intentionally and as [[bycatch]] via [[gillnet]]s and surface [[longline fishing|longlines]] across its range, most significantly off southwestern [[Florida]] and [[Venezuela]]; the meat is sold dried and salted.<ref name="compagno"/> In 2000, an estimated 86,510 kg (190,723 lbs, or 55,638 sharks) were landed by U.S. commercial and recreational fishers.<ref name="cortes">Cort<U+00E9>s, E.
