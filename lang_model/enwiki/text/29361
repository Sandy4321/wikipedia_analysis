'''State Route 566''' ('''SR 566, OH 566''') is a north&ndash;south [[state highway]] in eastern  [[Ohio]], a [[U.S. state]].  Located exclusively in northern [[Noble County, Ohio|Noble County]], State Route 566 has its southern terminus at [[Ohio State Route 147|State Route 147]], at a T-intersection {{convert|1.25|mi|km}} north of the [[unincorporated community]] of [[Mount Ephraim, Ohio|Mount Ephraim]].  Its northern terminus is at another T-intersection, this time with [[Ohio State Route 285|State Route 285]] approximately {{convert|1.25|mi|km}} south of the village of [[Senecaville, Ohio|Senecaville]].

==Route description==
State Route 566 begins at a T-intersection with [[Ohio State Route 147|State Route 147]] north of [[Mount Ephraim, Ohio|Mount Ephraim]].  Heading northwest from this intersection, State Route 566 passes through [[Seneca Township, Noble County, Ohio|Seneca Township]] amidst a blend of woods and open fields, and passing the occasional residence.  A series of spur gravel roadways split off from the state highway in this stretch to provide connections to additional area residences.  State Route 566 then arrives at its junction with [[Ohio State Route 574|State Route 574]], a T-intersection that serves as the intersecting state route's southern terminus. 

From the State Route 574 intersection, State Route 566 turns more to the west-northwest, and is abutted by open fields on both sides of the roadway.  The highway bends back to the northwest, and crosses into [[Wayne Township, Noble County, Ohio|Wayne Township]].  With some patches of trees lining up along the roadway amidst the open space, State Route 566 passes the Township Road 120 intersection, then turns to the north.  The state highway then bends back to the northwest, is briefly brushed up against by woods on both sides. and re-enters open farmland just before turning to the west, and arriving at its endpoint at a T-intersection with [[Ohio State Route 285|State Route 285]] south of the village of [[Senecaville, Ohio|Senecaville]].<ref name="YahooMap">{{yahoo maps |url=http://maps.yahoo.com/#mvt=h&lat=39.892845&lon=-81.437895&zoom=13&q1=39.862381%2C-81.412231&q2=39.914211%2C-81.458666|title=Overview Map of State Route 566 |accessdate=2010-06-06}}</ref>
