'''George VI''' (Albert Frederick Arthur George; 14 December 1895 &ndash; 6 February 1952) was [[British monarchy|King of the United Kingdom]] and the British [[Dominion]]s from 11 December 1936 until his death. He was the last [[Emperor of India]] (until 1947), the last [[King of Ireland]] (until 1949), and the first [[Head of the Commonwealth]].

Being the second son of [[George V of the United Kingdom|King George V]], he was not expected to inherit the throne, and spent his early life in the shadow of his elder brother, [[Edward VIII of the United Kingdom|Edward]]. He served in the [[Royal Navy]] during [[World War I]], and after the war took on the usual round of public engagements. He married Lady [[Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon]] in 1923, and they had two daughters, [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Elizabeth]] (who succeeded him as Queen Elizabeth II) and [[Princess Margaret, Countess of Snowdon|Margaret]].

George's elder brother ascended the throne as [[Edward VIII]] on the death of their father in 1936. However, less than a year later Edward revealed his desire to marry the twice-divorced American [[socialite]] [[Wallis, Duchess of Windsor|Wallis Simpson]]. For political and religious reasons, the British [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]], [[Stanley Baldwin]], advised Edward that he could not marry Mrs. Simpson and remain king. So, [[Edward VIII abdication crisis|Edward abdicated]] in order to marry. By reason of this abdication, unique in the history of the British Isles (previous abdications were forced by military or political pressures), George VI ascended the throne as the third monarch of the [[House of Windsor]].

Within twenty-four hours of his accession the Irish parliament, the [[Oireachtas]], passed the ''[[Executive Authority (External Relations) Act 1936|External Relations Act]]'', which essentially removed the power of the monarch in [[Irish Free State|Ireland]]. Further events greatly altered the position of the monarchy during his reign: three years after his accession, his realms, except Ireland, were at [[World War II|war]] with [[Nazi Germany]]. In the next two years, war with [[Kingdom of Italy (1861-1946)|Italy]] and the [[Empire of Japan]] followed. Though [[Allies of World War II|Britain and its allies]] were ultimately victorious, the United States and the [[Soviet Union]] rose as pre-eminent [[superpower|world powers]] and the [[British Empire]] declined. With the [[Indian Independence Act 1947|independence of India and Pakistan]] in 1947, and the [[Republic of Ireland Act|foundation of the Republic of Ireland]] in 1949, George's reign saw the acceleration of the break-up of the Empire and its transition into the [[Commonwealth of Nations]].

==Birth and family==
George VI was born at [[York Cottage]], on the [[Sandringham House|Sandringham Estate]] in [[Norfolk]], during the reign of his great-grandmother [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Queen Victoria]]. His father was Prince George, [[Duke of York]] (later [[George V of the United Kingdom|King George V]]), the second and eldest-surviving son of the Prince and Princess of Wales (later [[Edward VII of the United Kingdom|King Edward VII]] and [[Alexandra of Denmark|Queen Alexandra]]). His mother was the Duchess of York (later [[Mary of Teck|Queen Mary]]), the eldest daughter of [[Francis, Duke of Teck|the Duke]] and [[Princess Mary Adelaide of Cambridge|Duchess of Teck]].

His birthday (14 December 1895) was the anniversary of the death of his great-grandfather, [[Albert, Prince Consort|Prince Albert, the Prince Consort]]. Uncertain of how the Prince Consort's widow Queen Victoria would take the news of the birth, the Prince of Wales wrote to the Duke of York that the Queen had been "rather distressed".<ref name="bennett">{{citation |authorlink=John Wheeler-Bennett |last=Wheeler-Bennett |first=Sir John |title=King George VI: His Life and Reign |publisher=Macmillan |location=New York |year=1958 |pages=7<U+2013>8}}</ref> Two days later, he wrote again: "I really think it would gratify her if you yourself proposed the name ''Albert'' to her".<ref name="bennett" /> Queen Victoria was mollified by the proposal to name the new baby Albert, and wrote to the Duchess of York: "I am all impatience to see the ''new'' one, born on such a sad day but rather more dear to me, especially as he will be called by that dear name which is a byword for all that is great and good".<ref name="bennett" /> Consequently, he was [[baptism|baptised]] "Albert Frederick Arthur George" at St Mary Magdalene's Church near [[Sandringham House|Sandringham]] three months later.<ref>His [[godparent]]s were [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Queen Victoria]], [[Victoria, Princess Royal|Empress Frederick]], Grand Duke [[Friedrich Wilhelm, Grand Duke of Mecklenburg-Strelitz|Friedrich Wilhelm of Mecklenburg-Strelitz]], his wife the Grand Duchess (formerly [[Augusta of Cambridge|Princess Augusta of Cambridge]]), the [[Frederick VIII of Denmark|Crown Prince of Denmark]], the [[Prince Arthur, Duke of Connaught and Strathearn|Duke of Connaught]], [[Adolphus Cambridge, 1st Marquess of Cambridge|Prince Adolphus of Teck]], and the [[Louise, Princess Royal and Duchess of Fife|Duchess of Fife]]. Source: ''[[The Times]]'', Tuesday 18 February 1896, p.11</ref> As a great-grandson of Queen Victoria, he was known formally as "His Highness Prince Albert of York" from birth. Within the family, he was known informally as "Bertie".<ref>{{citation|last=Windsor|first=The Duke of|authorlink=Edward VIII of the United Kingdom|title=A King's Story|publisher=Cassell & Co Ltd|location=London|year=1951|page=9}}</ref> However, his maternal grandmother, the Duchess of Teck, did not like the first name the baby had been given, and she wrote prophetically that she hoped the last name "may supplant the less favoured one".<ref>{{citation |last=Bradford |first=Sarah |title=King George VI |publisher=Weidenfeld and Nicolson |location=London |year=1989 |page=2 |isbn=0-297-79667-4}}</ref>

Albert, as he was known, was fourth in line for the throne at birth, after his grandfather, father and older brother [[Edward VIII of the United Kingdom|Edward]].

==Early life==
[[Image:Edward VII UK and successors.jpg|thumb|left|Four kings: King Edward VII (far right), his son George, Prince of Wales, later George V (far left), and grandsons Edward, later Edward VIII (rear), and Albert, later George VI (foreground), c. 1908.]]

In 1898, Queen Victoria issued [[letters patent|Letters Patent]] that granted the children of the eldest son of the Prince of Wales the style ''[[Royal Highness]]'', and at the age of two, Albert became "His Royal Highness Prince Albert of York".

He often suffered from ill health and was described as "easily frightened and somewhat prone to tears".<ref>Wheeler-Bennett, pp. 17<U+2013>18</ref> His parents, the Duke and Duchess of York, were generally removed from their children's day-to-day upbringing, as was the norm in aristocratic families of that era. He was forced to write with his right hand although he was naturally [[Left-handedness|left-handed]], and developed a [[stuttering|stammer]] that lasted for many years. He suffered from chronic stomach problems as well as [[genu valgum|knock knees]], for which he was forced to wear painful corrective splints.<ref name="matthew">{{citation|first=H. C. G.|last=Matthew|authorlink=Colin Matthew|title=George VI (1895<U+2013>1952)|journal=Oxford Dictionary of National Biography|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2004}}</ref>

Queen Victoria died on 22 January 1901, and the Prince of Wales succeeded her as King Edward VII. The Duke of York became the new Prince of Wales. Prince Edward moved up to second in line to the throne, and Prince Albert was third.

==Military career and education==
From 1909, Albert attended the [[Osborne House|Royal Naval College, Osborne]] as a naval [[cadet]]. In 1911, he came bottom of the class in the final examination, and progressed to the [[Britannia Royal Naval College|Royal Naval College, Dartmouth]].<ref>Bradford, pp. 41<U+2013>45</ref> When Edward VII died in 1910, Albert's father became King George V. Prince Edward was created Prince of Wales, and Albert was second in line to the throne.

Albert was commissioned as a [[midshipman]] on 15 September 1913 and one year later began service in [[World War I]]. His fellow officers gave him the nickname "Mr. Johnson".<ref>''Current Biography 1942'', pp. 293<U+2013>296</ref> He saw action as a turret officer aboard [[HMS Collingwood (1908)|HMS ''Collingwood'']] against the [[German Empire|German]] [[Imperial German Navy|navy]] at the [[Battle of Jutland]] (31 May &ndash; 1 June 1916), an indecisive action which emerged as a strategic victory for the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]], but did not see further action in the war largely because of ill health caused by a [[peptic ulcer|duodenal ulcer]].<ref name=Bradford55>Bradford, pp. 55<U+2013>76</ref> In February 1918, he was appointed Officer in Charge of Boys at the [[Royal Naval Air Service]]'s training establishment at [[RAF Cranwell|Cranwell]].<ref name="cranwell">{{citation |url=http://www.raf.mod.uk/rafcranwell/aboutus/collegehistory.cfm |title=RAF Cranwell - College History|publisher=Royal Air Force|accessdate=22 April 2009}}</ref> With the establishment of the [[Royal Air Force]] two months later and the transfer of Cranwell from Navy to Air Force control, he transferred from the Royal Navy to the Royal Air Force.<ref name=Bradford55/> He was appointed Officer Commanding Number 4 Squadron of the Boys' Wing at Cranwell and he remained there until August 1918.<ref name="cranwell"/> During the closing weeks of the war, Albert served on the staff of the [[Independent Air Force]] at its headquarters in [[Nancy]].<ref>{{citation |last=Boyle |first=Andrew |authorlink=Andrew Boyle |title=Trenchard Man of Vision |year=1962 |publisher=Collins |location= St. James's Place London |page=360|chapter=Chapter 13}}</ref> Following the disbanding of the Independent Air Force in November 1918, he remained on the continent as a staff officer with the Royal Air Force.<ref>{{citation | last=Laffin | first=John | authorlink=John Laffin | title=Swifter than Eagles. A biography of Marshal of the RAF Sir John Salmond | publisher=William Blackwood & Sons Ltd | year=1964 | page=151}}</ref>

In October 1919, Albert went up to [[Trinity College, Cambridge]] where he studied history, economics and civics for a year.<ref>Wheeler-Bennett, pp. 128<U+2013>131</ref> On 3 June 1920, he was created [[Duke of York]], [[Earl of Inverness]] and [[Baron Killarney]].<ref name="creation">{{citation|author=Demoskoff, Yvonne|date=29 January 2006|url=http://mypage.uniserve.ca/~canyon/peerage_titles.htm#Holders |title=Yvonne's Royalty Home Page: Peerage Titles|accessdate=22 April 2009}}</ref> He then began to take on royal duties; he represented his father, the King, toured coal mines, factories, and railyards, and acquired the nickname of the "Industrial Prince".<ref>''Current Biography 1942'', p. 280</ref>

His speech impediment, and his embarrassment over it, together with his tendency to shyness, caused him to appear much less impressive than his older brother, Edward. However, he was physically active and enjoyed playing tennis.

==Marriage==
{{House of Windsor|george6}}
In a time when royals were expected to marry fellow royals, it was unusual that Albert had a great deal of freedom in choosing a prospective wife. In 1920 he met Lady [[Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon]], the youngest daughter of [[Claude Bowes-Lyon, 14th Earl of Strathmore and Kinghorne|the Earl]] and [[Cecilia Bowes-Lyon, Countess of Strathmore and Kinghorne|Countess of Strathmore and Kinghorne]]. He became determined to marry her.<ref>{{citation |last=Vickers |first=Hugo |title=Elizabeth: The Queen Mother |publisher=Arrow Books/Random House |year=2006 |isbn=978-00994-76627 |pages=31, 44}}</ref>

Although Lady Elizabeth was a descendant of King [[Robert I of Scotland]] and King [[Henry VII of England]], she was, according to British law, a [[commoner]]. She rejected his proposal twice and hesitated for nearly two years, reportedly because she was reluctant to make the sacrifices necessary to become a member of the royal family.<ref>Bradford, p. 106</ref> In the words of Lady Elizabeth's mother, Albert would be "made or marred" by his choice of wife, and after a protracted courtship Elizabeth agreed to marry him.<ref>Bradford, p. 77</ref>

They were married on 26 April 1923 in [[Westminster Abbey]]. The newly-formed [[British Broadcasting Company]] wished to record and broadcast the event on [[radio]], but the [[Chapter (religion)|Chapter]] vetoed the idea (although the [[List of Deans of Westminster|Dean]], [[Herbert Edward Ryle]], was in favour).<ref>{{citation |last=Reith |first=John |authorlink=John Reith |title=Into the Wind |publisher=Hodder and Staughton |location=London |year=1949 |page=94}}</ref> Lady Elizabeth was styled Her Royal Highness The Duchess of York after their marriage. Albert's marriage to a British commoner was considered a modernising gesture.<ref>{{citation | last=Roberts |first=Andrew |coauthors=Edited by [[Antonia Fraser]] |title=The House of Windsor|publisher=Cassell & Co. |location=London |year=2000 |isbn=0-304-35406-6 |pages=57<U+2013>58}}</ref>

The Duke and Duchess of York had two children, [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Elizabeth]] (called "Lilibet" by the family), born 21 April 1926, who would succeed her father as Elizabeth II, and [[Princess Margaret, Countess of Snowdon|Margaret]], born 21 August 1930. The Duke and Duchess and their two daughters lived a relatively sheltered life at their London residence, 145 [[Piccadilly]]. One of the few stirs arose when the [[Prime Minister of Canada|Canadian Prime Minister]], [[R. B. Bennett]], considered the Duke for [[Governor General of Canada]] in 1931&mdash;a proposal that the King rejected on the advice of his ministers.<ref>{{citation |last=Howarth |first=Patrick |title=George VI |publisher=Hutchinson |year=1987 |page=53 |isbn=0-091-71000-6}}</ref>

The Duchess helped him overcome his dread (due to stammering) of public speaking. He was introduced by her to Lionel Logue, an Australian-born expert on speech.<ref>Bowen, Caroline (2002), ''[http://www.speech-language-therapy.com/ll.htm Lionel Logue: Pioneer speech therapist]'', speech-language-therapy.com, retrieved on 22 April 2009</ref> The Duke and Logue practiced breathing exercises, and the Duchess rehearsed with him patiently. As a result of the training, the Duke's opening address at Australia's Federal Parliament at Canberra in 1927 went successfully, and he was able to speak thereafter with only a slight hesitation.<ref>''Current Biography 1942'', pp. 294<U+2013>295</ref>

==Reluctant king==
On 20 January 1936, King George V died and Prince Edward ascended the throne as Edward VIII. As Edward had no children, Albert was the [[heir presumptive]] to the throne until his unmarried brother had any legitimate children, or died. George V had had severe reservations about Edward, saying, "I pray God that my eldest son will never marry and that nothing will come between Bertie and Lilibet and the throne."<ref>{{citation |last=Ziegler |first=Philip |authorlink=Philip Ziegler |title=King Edward VIII: The Official Biography |location=London |publisher=Collins |year=1990 |page=199 |isbn=0-002-15741-1}}</ref> Less than a year later, on 11 December 1936, Edward VIII [[Edward VIII abdication crisis|abdicated]] the throne in order to marry his mistress, the twice-divorced American [[Wallis, Duchess of Windsor|Wallis Simpson]]. Edward had been advised by Prime Minister [[Stanley Baldwin]] that he could not remain King and marry a divorced woman with two living ex-husbands. Edward chose abdication in preference to abandoning his marriage plans. Thus Albert became king, a position he was reluctant to accept. The day before the abdication, he went to London to see his mother, [[Mary of Teck|Queen Mary]]. He wrote in his diary, "When I told her what had happened, I broke down and sobbed like a child."<ref>Wheeler-Bennett, p. 286</ref>

Courtier and journalist Dermot Morroh alleged that there was brief speculation as to the desirability of bypassing Albert (and his children) and his brother, [[Prince Henry, Duke of Gloucester]], in favour of their younger brother [[Prince George, Duke of Kent]]. This seems to have been suggested on the grounds that Prince George was at that time the only brother with a son.<ref>Howarth, p. 63</ref>

==Reign==
Albert assumed the style and title King George VI to emphasise continuity with his father and restore confidence in the monarchy.<ref>Howarth, p. 66</ref> The beginning of George VI's reign was taken up by questions surrounding his predecessor and brother, whose titles, style and position were uncertain. He had been introduced as "His Royal Highness Prince Edward" for the Abdication broadcast,<ref>{{citation | last=Sinclair |first=David |title=Two Georges: the Making of the Modern Monarchy |publisher=Hodder and Staughton |year=1988 |page=224 |isbn=0-340-33240-9}}</ref> but George VI felt that by abdicating and renouncing the succession Edward had lost the right to bear Royal titles, including "Royal Highness".<ref>Howarth, p. 143</ref> In settling the issue, George's first act as King was to confer upon his brother the title HRH The [[Duke of Windsor]], but the [[letters patent|Letters Patent]] creating the dukedom prevented any wife or children from bearing royal styles. George VI was also forced to buy the royal residences of [[Balmoral Castle]] and [[Sandringham House]] from Prince Edward, as these were private properties and did not pass to George VI automatically.<ref>Ziegler, p. 326</ref> Three days after his accession, on his 41st birthday, he invested his wife, the new Queen, with the [[Order of the Garter]].<ref>Bradford, p. 223</ref>

George VI's [[Coronation of the British monarch|coronation]] took place on 12 May 1937, the date previously intended for Edward's coronation. In a break with tradition, Queen Mary attended the ceremony as a show of support for her son.<ref>Bradford, p. 214</ref> There was no [[durbar (court)|Durbar]] held in [[Delhi]] for George VI, as had occurred for his father, as the cost would have been a burden to the [[British Raj|government of India]].<ref>Vickers, p. 175</ref> Rising [[Indian independence movement|Indian nationalism]] made the welcome that the royal couple would have received likely to be muted at best,<ref>Bradford, p. 209</ref> and a prolonged absence from Britain would have been undesirable in the tense period before [[World War II]]. Two overseas tours were undertaken, to France and North America, both of which promised greater strategic advantages in the event of war.<ref>Bradford, pp. 269, 281</ref>

The growing likelihood of war in Europe dominated the early reign of George VI. The King was constitutionally bound to support Prime Minister [[Neville Chamberlain]]'s [[appeasement of Hitler]]. However, when the King and Queen greeted Chamberlain on his return from negotiating the [[Munich Agreement]] in 1938, they invited him to appear on the balcony of [[Buckingham Palace]] with them. This public association of the monarchy with a politician was exceptional, as balcony appearances were traditionally restricted to the royal family.<ref name="matthew" />
[[Image:RoyalVisitSenate.jpg|thumb|right|George VI, as [[Monarchy in Canada|King of Canada]], grants [[Royal Assent]] to laws in the [[Senate of Canada|Canadian Senate]], 19 May 1939. His consort, Queen Elizabeth, is to the right.]]

In 1939, the King and Queen undertook an extensive tour of Canada, during which they made a brief visit to the United States. From [[Ottawa]], the royal couple were accompanied throughout the trip by the [[Prime Minister of Canada]], and not a [[Cabinet of the United Kingdom|British minister]], meaning they were present in both Canada and the US as [[Monarchy in Canada|King and Queen of Canada]].<ref name="Parl">{{citation | url=http://www2.parl.gc.ca/Sites/LOP/Infoparl/english/issue.asp?param=130&art=820 |last=Galbraith |first=William |journal=Canadian Parliamentary Review |title=Fiftieth Anniversary of the 1939 Royal Visit |volume=12 |issue=3 |year=1989 |accessdate=22 April 2009}}</ref> George was the first reigning Monarch of Canada to visit North America, though he had been to Canada previously as Prince Albert and as Duke of York. The Canadian Prime Minister, [[William Lyon Mackenzie King|Mackenzie King]], hoped that the King's presence in Canada would allow him to demonstrate in reality the principles of the [[Statute of Westminster 1931]], which gave full self-government to the [[Dominion]]s and recognised each Dominion as having a separate crown. Thus, at his Canadian residence, [[Rideau Hall]], George VI personally accepted and approved the [[Letter of Credence]] of the newly appointed U.S. Ambassador to Canada, [[Daniel Calhoun Roper]]. The official Royal Tour historian, [[Gustave Lanctot]], stated: "When Their Majesties walked into their Canadian residence, the Statute of Westminster had assumed full reality: the King of Canada had come home."<ref name="Parl" />

The entire trip was a measure intended to soften the strong [[isolationism|isolationist]] tendencies among the North American public with regard to the developing tensions in Europe. Although the aim of the tour was mainly political, to shore up Atlantic support for Britain in any future war, the King and Queen were enthusiastically received by the Canadian public.<ref>Vickers, p. 187</ref> The fear that George would be unfavourably compared to his predecessor, Edward VIII, was dispelled.<ref>Bradford, pp. 298<U+2013>299</ref> They were warmly received by the American people, visiting the [[1939 New York World's Fair]] and staying with [[President of the United States|President]] [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] at the [[White House]] and at [[Home of Franklin D. Roosevelt National Historic Site|his private estate]] at [[Hyde Park, New York]].<ref>''The Times'' Monday, 12 June 1939 p. 12 col. A</ref>

When war broke out in 1939, George VI and his wife resolved to stay in London and not flee to Canada, as had been suggested. The King and Queen officially stayed in Buckingham Palace throughout the war, although they usually spent nights at [[Windsor Castle]] to avoid [[The Blitz|bombing raids]]. George VI and Queen Elizabeth narrowly avoided death when two German bombs exploded in a courtyard at Buckingham Palace while they were there.<ref>{{citation |last=Churchill |first=Winston |authorlink=Winston Churchill |title=The Second World War |publisher=Cassell and Co. Ltd |year=1949 |volume=II |page=334}}</ref>

[[Image:09-2361a.jpg|270px|thumb|left|[[Eleanor Roosevelt]] (centre), King George VI and Queen Elizabeth in London, 23 October 1942.]]

In 1940, Neville Chamberlain was replaced as Prime Minister by [[Winston Churchill]]. Throughout the war, the King and Queen provided morale-boosting visits throughout the UK, visiting bomb sites and munitions factories. After the bombing of Buckingham Palace, the Queen famously declared: "I'm glad we have been bombed. Now I can look the [[East End]] in the face". Along with the rest of the country, the Royal Family were subject to [[Rationing in the United Kingdom|rationing restrictions]], and [[First Lady of the United States|U.S. First Lady]] [[Eleanor Roosevelt]] remarked on the rationed food served in the Palace and the limited bathwater that was permitted during a visit in 1942.<ref>{{citation | last=Goodwin |first=Doris Kearns |authorlink=Doris Kearns Goodwin |title=No Ordinary Time: Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt: The Home Front in World War II |location=New York |publisher=Simon & Schuster |year=1994 |page=380}}</ref>

Author Will Swift has suggested that a strong bond of friendship was forged between the King and Queen and President and First Lady during the 1939 Royal Tour, which had major significance in the relations between the United States and the United Kingdom through the war years.<ref>{{citation |last=Swift |first=Will |title=The Roosevelts and the Royals: Franklin and Eleanor, the King and Queen of England, and the Friendship that Changed History |publisher=John Wiley & Sons |year=2004}}</ref> However, there have never been credible suggestions that the King took any strategic role in the war; his frequent letters to the President were mostly unanswered, and it was Roosevelt's relationship with Churchill that was critical. Eleanor Roosevelt took a wry view of the utility of kings and queens and the substance of George and Elizabeth ("a little self-consciously regal" was her verdict on Elizabeth).<ref>{{citation |last=Lash |first=Joseph P. |title=Eleanor and Franklin |location=New York |publisher=Norton |year=1971 |page=582}}</ref>

In 1945, crowds shouted "We want the King!" in front of Buckingham Palace during the [[Victory in Europe Day]] celebrations. In an echo of Chamberlain's appearance, the King invited Churchill to appear with him on the balcony to public acclaim.

==Empire to Commonwealth==

[[Image:King George VI statute in Niagra Falls.jpg|thumb|left|Statue of King George VI in Niagara Falls, Ontario.]]

George VI's reign saw the acceleration of the dissolution of the [[British Empire]], which had begun with the [[Balfour Declaration of 1926|Balfour Declaration]] at the [[1926 Imperial Conference]], when the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] came into being and the Dominions were acknowledged to have evolved into [[sovereignty|sovereign]] states over a period of years<U+2014>a declaration which was formalised in the [[Statute of Westminster 1931]].<ref>{{citation|url=http://www.thecommonwealth.org/Internal/34493/140633/timeline/|title=History: Timeline|publisher=The Commonwealth Secretariat| accessdate=22 April 2009}}</ref>

Britain's brief [[League of Nations]] [[British Mandate of Mesopotamia|Mandate over Iraq]] ended in 1932 with Iraqi independence without membership in the as-yet ill-defined Commonwealth even being considered. This process gathered pace after World War II. [[Transjordan]] became independent as the [[Jordan|Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan]] in 1946, [[Myanmar|Burma]] in January 1948, and [[British Mandate of Palestine|Palestine]] (although divided between [[Israel]] and the Arab states) that May; all three opted out of the Commonwealth. After declaring itself a Republic, southern [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]] left the Commonwealth the following year. India became the two independent dominions of India and [[Pakistan]]. George relinquished the title of [[Emperor of India]], and became King of India and [[King of Pakistan]] instead. He remained King of Pakistan until his death, but in 1950 George ceased to be King of India when that country became a republic within the Commonwealth of Nations, recognising George's new title as [[Head of the Commonwealth]].

==Illness and death==
The stress of the war had taken its toll on the King's health,<ref>{{citation|publisher=Official web site of the British monarchy|title=King George VI|url=http://www.royal.gov.uk/HistoryoftheMonarchy/KingsandQueensoftheUnitedKingdom/TheHouseofWindsor/GeorgeVI.aspx|accessdate=22 April 2009}}</ref> exacerbated by his heavy [[tobacco smoking|smoking]] and subsequent development of [[lung cancer]] among other ailments including [[arteriosclerosis]]. Increasingly his daughter Princess Elizabeth, the heiress presumptive, took on more royal duties as her father's health deteriorated. In September 1951, George VI underwent a [[pneumonectomy]] where his left lung was removed following the discovery of a malignant tumour.<ref>Bradford, p. 454</ref>

On 31 January 1952, despite advice from those close to him, he went to the airport to see off Princess Elizabeth, who was going on a tour of Australia via [[Kenya]].

George held a number of titles throughout his life, as successively great-grandchild, grandchild and son of the monarch. As sovereign, he was referred to most often as simply ''The King'' or ''His Majesty''; if a distinction was necessary, this was modified to ''His Britannic Majesty'', ''His Imperial Majesty'', ''His Canadian Majesty'', etc. When in conversation with the King, the practice was to address him initially as ''Your Majesty'' and thereafter as ''Sir''. In his position as sovereign, George automatically held the position of [[Commander-in-Chief]] in realms, such as Canada<ref>{{Citation |first=Parliament of the United Kingdom| author-link=Parliament of the United Kingdom| title=Constitution Act 1867; III.15| year=1867| publisher=Queen's Printer for Canada| url=http://laws.justice.gc.ca/en/const/c1867_e.html|accessdate=22 April 2009}}</ref> and the United Kingdom.<ref>{{citation| url=http://www.royal.gov.uk/MonarchUK/ArmedForces/QueenandtheArmedForces.aspx |title=The Queen and the Armed Forces |publisher=Official web site of the British monarchy |accessdate=22 April 2009}}</ref>
