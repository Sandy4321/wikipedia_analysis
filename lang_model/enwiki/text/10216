==Background==
French archaeologist and historian [[L<U+00E9>on Heuzey]] began working with the [[French School at Athens]] in Greece at the age of 20 in 1851.<ref name="Monceaux">Monceaux, Paul (1922). [http://www.persee.fr/web/revues/home/prescript/article/crai_0065-0536_1922_num_66_1_74560 <U+00C9>loge fun<U+00E8>bre de M. L<U+00E9>on Heuzey, membre de l'Acad<U+00E9>mie]. ''Comptes rendus des s<U+00E9>ances de l'Acad<U+00E9>mie des Inscriptions et Belles-Lettres''. 66  (1): 53<U+2013>56.</ref> He made his most famous discovery of that period in the town of [[Farsala]], a city in southern [[Thessaly]].<ref>Schwartz, Emmanuel.

Institut National d'Histoire de l'Art.</ref> In antiquity, the area was named Pharsalos, and became known for the [[Battle of Pharsalus]] in 48&nbsp;BCE, where [[Julius Caesar]] defeated [[Pompey]] during the [[Caesar's Civil War|Great Roman Civil War]].<ref>Fields, Nic (2010). ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=be8QeVIPSVkC&lpg=PA23&pg=PA23#v=onepage&q&f=false Julius Caesar: Leadership, Strategy, Conflict]''. Osprey Publishing. pp.&nbsp;23<U+2013>26. ISBN 9781846039287.</ref>

Heuzey and the architect Henri Daumet were involved in an official mission to collect objects related to Caesar's campaigns; they were also interested in other artifacts unrelated to their work.<ref name="Monceaux"/>  In 1863, they found the marble bas-relief of ''The Exaltation of the Flower'' embedded in the walls of a church in the neighborhood of Paleo-Loutro in Farsala.  Heuzey was informed that the stone was originally discovered in a garden, close to another stone that was not recovered. Heuzey purchased the stone and had it sent to the [[Louvre]] in Paris.<ref name="madm">Heuzey, L.; H. Daumet (1876).

Paris. pp.&nbsp;415<U+2013>417.</ref><ref name="Heuzey"/> Back in France, Heuzy would become curator of the Louvre, where he would retire in 1908.<ref name="Monceaux"/>

==Description==
[[File:Farsala.jpg|thumb|The town of Farsala as seen by Italian artist Simone Pomardi (1757<U+2013>1830) in the early 19th century]]
A precise description and interpretation of the work has remained elusive since its initial discovery in the 19th century. Scholars agree on some aspects and disagree on others.<ref name="Tufts">[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/artifact?name=Louvre+Ma+701&object=sculpture Louvre Ma 701 (Sculpture)]. Perseus Project. Tufts University.</ref>  British Greek art scholar [[Martin Robertson]] notes that both females can be seen wearing the tubular [[peplos]] garment common to the Classical period.  Robertson believes that the bottom missing fragment would have showed the girl on the left standing and the woman on the right seated.<ref>Robertson, Martin (1981). ''A Shorter History of Greek Art''. Cambridge University Press. ISBN 0521280842. pp.&nbsp;57<U+2013>58.</ref><ref>The German Archaeological Institute (DAI) and the Archaeological Institute of the University of Cologne hosts an image using extrapolation to reconstruct the missing bottom fragment.

==Analysis==
In his 1868 paper, Heuzey argued that the images in the stele suggested the goddesses Persephone and Demeter, referring to the [[Persephone|cult of Kore]] and the legend of Demeter found in the [[Homeric Hymns]].  French archaeologist and art historian Maxime Collignon explained, "Heuzey believes that this monument refers to the cultus of Core, daughter of Demeter, a divinity suggesting in Greek legend the ephemeral but incessantly recurring bloom of nature."<ref name="Coll"/>  French archaeologist Olivier Rayet disagreed with the interpretation Heuzy offered.<ref name="Monceaux"/> While Heuzey's perspective still has adherents, it has largely fallen out of favor among art historians.  According to the [[Perseus Project]] at Tufts University, "It is now generally agreed&nbsp;... that the figures represented are mortals rather than goddesses."<ref name="Tufts"/>

German archaeologist [[Heinrich Brunn]] believed the decorative qualities of the Pharsalos stele originated in [[Asia Minor]].  Following this line of reasoning, Scottish archaeologist [[Alexander Stuart Murray]] compared the facial features of the stele, such as the eyes, lips, and nose, to similar facial features found in the [[Harpy Tomb]] relief from  Xanthos in Lycia.<ref name="Murray">Murray, Alexander Stuart (1880).

London: John Murray. pp. 289-291.</ref>  American curator [[Edward Robinson (curator)|Edward Robinson]] notes the influence of the [[Ionia|Ionic school]]s on this and other artwork from ancient [[Thessaly|Aeolia]], now known as Thessaly: "It is now a question whether these works were done by local artists under this influence, or by Ionic artists who may have established themselves in Thessaly, as they did in other parts of Greece."<ref name="Robinson">Robinson, Edward (1896).

Museum of Fine Arts Boston. p. 32.</ref>  The Ionian style's influence can also be seen in the depiction of the hair-net worn by the women in the relief.<ref>Benson, Carol (2001).

In 1911, Greek scholar and archaeologist Rufus B. Richardson, formerly of the [[American School of Classical Studies at Athens]], observed that the flowers in the relief looked similar to mushrooms.<ref name="Richardson">Richardson, Rufus Byam (1911).

American Book Company. pp. 73, 96.</ref> English classicist [[Robert Graves]] and Italian ethnobotanist [[Giorgio Samorini]] have both referred to ''The Exaltation of the Flower'' as evidence for the [[entheogen]] hypothesis, speculating that the flowers depicted in the work are actually a type of psychoactive mushroom that was used in the [[Eleusinian Mysteries]].<ref>Samorini, Giorgio (1998).
