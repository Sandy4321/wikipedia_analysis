==Biography==
===Early life===
Aniston was born in [[Sherman Oaks]], [[Los Angeles]], [[California]], and grew up in [[New York City]]. She is the daughter of the actor [[John Aniston]] and actress [[Nancy Dow]]. Aniston has two half-brothers, John Melick (older) and Alex Aniston (younger). Aniston's father is a [[Greek American]] born on the island of [[Crete]], [[Greece]], while her mother was born in [[New York City]] of [[English people|English]], [[Scottish people|Scottish]] and [[Italy|Italian]] descent. Aniston's [[Godparent|godfather]] was the late actor [[Telly Savalas]], her father's best friend. Aniston lived in Greece for one year as a child with her family, and they later relocated to New York City. Her father has appeared in the [[soap opera]]s ''[[Days of Our Lives]]'', ''[[Love of Life]]'' and ''[[Search for Tomorrow]]''. Aniston attended the New York [[Waldorf education|Rudolf Steiner School]]<ref>[http://www.esquire.com/women/women-we-love/ESQ1002-OCT_ANISTON Esquire Online]</ref> and graduated from [[Manhattan]]'s [[Fiorello H. LaGuardia High School of Music & Art and Performing Arts]]. Among her high school friends was future gay rights activist [[Chastity Bono]]. Aniston's desire to become an actress grew as she worked in [[Off Broadway]] productions such as ''For Dear Life'' and ''Dancing on Checker's Grave''. During this time, she supported herself with several part-time jobs, including working as a [[Telemarketing|telemarketer]] and bike messenger. In 1989, she moved to [[Los Angeles, California]].<ref>[http://www.tiscali.co.uk/entertainment/film/biographies/jennifer_aniston_biog/4 Tiscali biography of Jennifer Aniston.]</ref>

===Career===
Aniston moved to [[Hollywood]] and was cast in her first television role in 1990, starring as a regular on the short-lived series ''[[Molloy]]'' and in the TV movie ''[[Camp Cucamonga]]''. She also co-starred in ''[[Ferris Bueller (TV series)|Ferris Bueller]]'', a television adaptation of the 1986 hit movie ''[[Ferris Bueller's Day Off]]''.  The series, however, was quickly canceled. Aniston then appeared in two more failed television comedy shows, ''[[The Edge (TV series)|The Edge]]'' and ''[[Muddling Through]]'', and guest-starred on ''[[Quantum Leap (TV series)|Quantum Leap]]'', ''[[Herman's Head]]'', and ''[[Burke's Law]]''. After the string of cancelled shows, along with her appearance in the critically derided 1992 [[Horror Film|horror film]], ''[[Leprechaun (movie)|Leprechaun]]'', Aniston considered giving up acting. Aniston's plans changed, however, after auditioning for ''[[Friends]]'', a sitcom that was set to debut on [[NBC]]'s 1994-1995 fall line-up. The producers of the show originally wanted Aniston to audition for the role of [[Monica Geller]], but she persuaded them that she was better suited for the role of [[Rachel Green]]. She was cast in the role and played the character from 1994 until the show ended in 2004.

The program was hugely successful and Aniston, along with her co-stars, gained wide renown among television viewers. Her hairstyle at the time, which became known as the [["Rachel" haircut|"Rachel"]], was widely copied. Aniston received a salary of one million dollars per episode for the last two seasons of ''Friends'', as well as five [[Emmy]] nominations, including a win for "Outstanding Lead Actress in a Comedy Series". According to the ''Guinness World Book of Records'' (2005), Aniston (along with her female costars) became the highest paid TV actress of all time with her $1 million-per-episode paycheck for the tenth season of ''Friends.''

In 1994, [[Microsoft]] invited Aniston, along with comedian [[Matthew Perry (actor)|Matthew Perry]], to shoot a 30-minute promotional advertisement for their new operating system, [[Windows 95]]. In addition to her career as a TV actress, Aniston has enjoyed a successful film career. Her biggest box office success to date was her appearance in 2003's [[Bruce Almighty]], in which she played the girlfriend of title character ([[Jim Carrey]]); the film grossed $243M at the United States box office and almost twice that worldwide. Aniston's 2004 film, [[Along Came Polly]] (opposite [[Ben Stiller]]), also did well at the box office after opening at the #1 spot.

She gained critical acclaim for her performances in ''[[The Object of My Affection]]'' (1998), a comedy drama about a girl who falls for a gay man, and in the low-budget 2002 film, ''[[The Good Girl]]'', directed by [[Miguel Arteta]], playing an unglamorous cashier in a small town. The latter film opened in relatively few theaters - under 700 in total - taking $14M in the U.S. box office. In late 2005, Aniston headlined two major studio films, ''[[Derailed]]'' and ''[[Rumor Has It]]'', both of which performed fairly at the box office, grossing over $36 million each despite little support from critics.

In 2006, Aniston appeared in the low-budget drama, ''[[Friends with Money]]'', which was first shown at the [[Sundance Film Festival]], received a limited release, and grossed over $13 million. Aniston's next film, ''[[The Break-Up]]'', which was released on [[June 2]], grossed approximately $39.17 million during its opening weekend, despite lukewarm reviews.<ref name="gross">{{cite web | title=Box Office Mojo| work=The Break-Up's opening weekend gross | url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=breakup.htm | accessmonthday=June 16 | accessyear=2006}}</ref> It has currently grossed over $118 million at the U.S. box office and over $203 million worldwide.

In [[2007 in television|2007]], Aniston guest starred in an episode of [[Courteney Cox|Courteney Cox Arquette's]] series ''[[Dirt (TV series)|Dirt]]''. Aniston played Arquette's snobby rival Tina Harrod.<ref>{{cite web | title=TVSquad.com | work=Jennifer Aniston to guest star on Dirt | url=http://www.tvsquad.com/2007/01/16/jennifer-aniston-to-guest-star-on-dirt/ | accessmonthday=March 2 | accessyear=2007}}</ref> In addition to acting, Aniston has also directed a hospital emergency room-set [[Short subject|short film]] named ''Room 10'', starring [[Robin Wright Penn]] and [[Kris Kristofferson]]; Aniston has noted that she was inspired to direct by actress [[Gwyneth Paltrow]], who directed a short film in 2006.

''[[Forbes]]'' listed Aniston as the 10th richest woman in the [[entertainment industry]] for the year 2007. She is behind such powerhouses as [[Oprah Winfrey]], [[J. K. Rowling]], [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]], [[Celine Dion]] and [[Jennifer Lopez]] and is ahead of [[Britney Spears]], [[Christina Aguilera]] and the [[Olsen twins]].

They shocked their fans several days later when they announced their separation on [[January 7]] [[2005]]. 

Rumors that Pitt had fallen for actress [[Angelina Jolie]] began when they were filming the movie ''[[Mr. & Mrs. Smith (2005 film)|Mr. and Mrs. Smith]]''. Jolie and Pitt both denied any claims of [[adultery]], with Jolie declaring in an interview in 2005, "To be intimate with a married man, when my own father cheated on my mother, is not something I could forgive. I could not look at myself in the morning if I did that. I wouldn't be attracted to a man who would cheat on his wife."<ref>{{cite web|authors=Julian Kesner and Michelle Megna|url=http://web.archive.org/web/20060207100110/http://www.nydailynews.com/front/story/387860p-329048c.html|title=Angelina, saint vs. sinner|accessdate=2008-05-21|date=2006-02-07|work=[[Daily News (New York)|New York Daily]]}}</ref> Pitt and Aniston were seen together publicly after announcing their separation, even at a dinner party for Aniston's thirty-sixth birthday in February, and friends of the couple had declared they were reconciling.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,1017187_1028733,00.html|title=Brad & Jen Reunite for Her Birthday|accessdate=2008-05-21|date=2005-02-17|work=[[People (magazine)|People]]}}</ref> Aniston, however, filed for divorce on [[March 25]] [[2005]],<ref>{{cite web|first=Stephen M.|last=Silverman|url=http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,1042412,00.html|title=Jennifer Files for Divorce from Brad|accessdate=2008-05-21|date=2005-03-25|work=[[People (magazine)|People]]}}</ref>.

Media reports speculated that the split was due to Aniston's refusal to have children; t-shirts were  sold after their separation with the phrase "I'll Have Your Baby, Brad!". Aniston denied that this was the cause of their split in an August 2005 ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'' interview, stating, "I've never in my life said I didn't want to have children... I've always wanted to have children, and I would never give up that experience for a career." Aniston also revealed that her divorce prompted her to reach out to her mother, from whom she was estranged for nearly a decade. They initially became estranged when Nancy talked about her daughter on a TV show and later wrote a book titled ''From Mother and Daughter to Friends: A Memoir'' (1999).<ref>[http://www.vanityfair.com/fame/features/2005/09/aniston200509 The Unsinkable Jennifer Aniston]</ref><ref>{{cite news | first=Charles | last=Laurence |title=Not even friends... | date=2006-12-15 | publisher=''Los Angeles National Post'' | url =http://www.fact.on.ca/news/news0001/np00010b.htm}}</ref>

The intense media scrutiny of Aniston's private life continued. It was reported in April 2008 that singer [[John Mayer]] and Aniston were an item. A few weeks later, Mayer hinted the rumours were true when he told reporters "listen, this is not a scandal, this is not an issue, this is not a problem, this needs no spin control".<ref>[http://www.news.com.au/entertainment/story/0,26278,23658634-10388,00.html John Mayer,30, happy with Jennifer Aniston] They have been pictured looking very cosy on holiday abroad.

Aniston has had two [[septoplasty|septoplasties]] to correct her [[deviated septum]]; &mdash; one which was incorrectly done in 1994 and the second in January 2007. Septoplasty is a surgical operation that helps alleviate a common condition that can lead to breathing difficulty and trouble sleeping.<ref>{{cite web | title=usmagazine.com | work=Jen Gets a Nose Job | url=http://www.usmagazine.com/jens_secret_nose_job | accessmonthday=March 2 | accessyear=2007}}</ref>
