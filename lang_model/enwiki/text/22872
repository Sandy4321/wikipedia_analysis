'''Monte Franklin Pierce Stratton''' (May 21, 1912 - September 29, 1982), nicknamed "Gander", was a [[Major League Baseball]] [[pitcher]]. He was born in [[Celeste, Texas]], [[USA]]. 

Stratton played five years with the [[Chicago White Sox]] (1934-38), compiling a career 36-23 record with 196 [[strikeout]]s and a 3.71 [[Earned run average|ERA]] in 487.1 innings. His major league career ended prematurely when a hunting accident in 1938 forced doctors to amputate his right leg.

A 6-foot-5-inch right-hander, Stratton made his debut with the White Sox on June 2, 1934. He became a [[Starting pitcher|starter]] in 1937, [[Win (baseball statistics)|winning]] 15 games with a 2.40 ERA and five [[shutout]]s, and made the [[American League]] [[Major League Baseball All-Star Game|All-Star]] squad. The following season, he also won 15 and [[Complete game|completed]] 17 of his 22 starts. 

On November 27, 1938, Stratton was hunting rabbits on his family farm when he fell, accidentally discharging a holstered pistol. The bullet struck his right leg, damaging a main artery enough to require amputation.<ref name="BD">{{cite journal | last = Sheldon | first = Harold | title = Finishing the Stratton Story | journal = Baseball Digest | volume = 8 | issue = 9 | pages = 45-48 | publisher = Lakeside Publishing Co. | date = September 1949 | url = http://www.google.com/books?id=1TIDAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA45 | issn = 0005-609X | accessdate = 24 January 2009}}</ref> Equipped with a wooden leg, Stratton worked with the White Sox the next two years as a [[Coach (baseball)|coach]] and [[At bat|batting]] practice pitcher. When [[World War II]] started, he tried to enlist but was rejected. Then, he organized a semipro baseball team at [[Greenville, Texas]], and constantly practiced coordination on the field.

Throughout the early- and mid-1940s, Stratton attempted to comeback from his injury, pitching in the [[Minor league baseball|minors]] and semi-pro games.<ref name="BD" /> His return to baseball was rough sledding because other teams persistently [[Bunt (baseball)|bunted]] balls out of his reach, but Stratton finally was able to make a successful comeback winning 18 games with the Class-C Sherman Twins of the East Texas League. 

His comeback attempt was the subject of the film ''[[The Stratton Story]]'' ([[Sam Wood]], [[1949 in film|1949]]),<ref name="BD" /> which starred [[James Stewart (actor)|Jimmy Stewart]] and [[June Allyson]], with big-leaguers [[Gene Bearden]], [[Bill Dickey]] and [[Jimmy Dykes]] in cameo appearances.  

Stratton died in Greenville, Texas, on September 29, 1982, at the age of 70.
