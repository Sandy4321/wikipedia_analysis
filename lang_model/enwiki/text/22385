'''Rochdale Town Hall''' is a [[Victorian era|Victorian-era]] [[City and town halls|municipal building]] in [[Rochdale]], [[Greater Manchester]], [[England]]. It is "widely recognised as being one of the finest municipal buildings in the country",<ref name="RMBC43">{{harvnb|Rochdale Metropolitan Borough Council|N.D.|p=43}}.</ref> and is rated by [[English Heritage]] as [[Grade I listed buildings in Greater Manchester|Grade I]]. The Town Hall functions as the ceremonial headquarters of [[Metropolitan Borough of Rochdale|Rochdale Metropolitan Borough Council]] and houses administrative branches for local government, such as the borough's [[civil registry|civil registration office]].

Rochdale Town Hall is of the [[Gothic Revival architecture|Gothic Revival style]], built to a design by [[William Henry Crossland]] which won a competition in 1864. The Town Hall was built at a cost of <U+00A3>160,000 (<U+00A3>{{formatnum:{{Inflation|UK|160000|1871|r=-4}}|0}} as of {{CURRENTYEAR}}),{{Inflation-fn|UK}} and officially opened to the [[County Borough of Rochdale|Municipal Borough of Rochdale]] on 7 September 1871. The original design included a {{convert|240|ft|m|0|adj=on}} [[clock tower]] topped by a wooden spire with a gilded statue of [[Saint George]]. Both the spire and statue were destroyed by fire on 10 April 1883, leaving the building without a spire for four years. A new {{convert|191|ft|m|0|adj=on}} stone clock tower and spire in the style of [[Manchester Town Hall]] was designed by [[Alfred Waterhouse]], and erected in 1888 as a replacement.

Art critic [[Nikolaus Pevsner]] described the building as one of "rare picturesque beauty",<ref name="Pevsner 59">{{harvnb|Hartwell|Hyde|Pevsner|2004|p=59.}}</ref> while its [[stained glass]] windows, some of which were designed by [[William Morris]], are credited as "the finest modern examples of their kind".<ref name="RMBC43"/> The building came to the attention of [[Adolf Hitler]] who was said to have admired it so much that he wished to ship the building, brick-by-brick, to [[Nazi Germany]] had the [[United Kingdom]] been defeated in [[World War II]].

==History==
Since the [[Industrial Revolution]], Rochdale had developed as an increasingly large, populous, and prosperous urban [[mill town]]. Its newly-built rail and canal network, and numerous manufactories resulted in the town being "remarkable for many wealthy merchants".<ref name="Roch7">{{harvnb|Godman|2005|p=7}}.</ref> In January 1856 the inhabitant householders of the [[Rochdale (UK Parliament constituency)|Rochdale constituency]] petitioned the [[Privy Council]] for the grant of a [[royal charter|charter of incorporation]] under the [[Municipal Corporations Act 1835]], to constitute the town as a [[municipal borough]].  This would give it limited political autonomy via an elected town council, comprising a mayor, [[Alderman|aldermen]], and [[councillor]]s, to oversee local affairs.<ref name=lg21845>{{LondonGazette |issue=21845 |date=1856-02-01 |startpage=365 |accessdate=2008-07-09}}</ref> The petition was successful and the charter was granted in September 1856.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.link4life.org/index.cfm?fuseaction=c.showPage&pageID=788 |title=Rochdale's Charter of Incorporation (and Letters) |accessdate=2008-07-09 |work=Link 4 Life |author=Norman Moorsom |publisher=Rochdale Boroughwide Community Trust |date= }}</ref> The newly formed Rochdale Corporation<U+2014>the [[local authority]] for the [[County Borough of Rochdale|Municipal Borough of Rochdale]]<U+2014>initiated plans to build a [[city and town halls|town hall]] in which to conduct its business thereafter,<ref name=link>{{cite web|url=http://www.link4life.org/index.cfm?fuseaction=c.showPage&pageID=739|publisher=link4life.org|title=Rochdale Town Hall|accessdate=2010-01-17|author=Rochdale Boroughwide Community Trust }}</ref> and in 1864 set aside <U+00A3>20,000 (<U+00A3>{{formatnum:{{Inflation|UK|20000|1856|r=-4}}|0}} as of {{CURRENTYEAR}}){{Inflation-fn|UK}} for this purpose. A design competition was held, which offered the winning architect a prize of <U+00A3>100 (<U+00A3>{{formatnum:{{Inflation|UK|100|1864|r=-2}}|0}} as of {{CURRENTYEAR}}),{{Inflation-fn|UK}} and a [[Maltese cross]] souvenir. 27&nbsp;entries were received, out of which [[William Henry Crossland]] won the final approval.<ref name=images/><ref name=link/> The Rochdale-born [[Radicals (UK)|Radical]] and [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal]] statesman [[John Bright]] laid the foundation stone on 31&nbsp;March 1866.  Construction was complete by 1871 although the cost had, by then, increased beyond expectations to <U+00A3>160,000 (<U+00A3>{{formatnum:{{Inflation|UK|160000|1871|r=-4}}|0}} as of {{CURRENTYEAR}}).{{Inflation-fn|UK}}<ref name=link/><ref>{{harvnb|Hartwell|Hyde|Pevsner|2004|p=594.}}</ref><ref name="Roch10"/>
[[File:Rochdale Town Hall, 1874.png|thumb|left|alt=|Rochdale Town Hall as it appeared in 1874, including its original {{convert|240|ft|m|0|adj=on}} clock tower with wooden spire.]]
Rochdale Town Hall was one of several built in [[mill town|textile towns]] of [[North West England]] during this period, but is one of only two in Greater Manchester to have been built in a Gothic style.  Between the setting of the foundation stone and the building's completion, revisions and additions were made to the original design. Money was "lavished" upon the decor and inventory, and though the extra expenditure did not escape the ire of its critics, the building was ultimately celebrated as "a source of pride", and its completion prompted celebration and rejoicing.<ref name=link/> The opening ceremony on 27&nbsp;September 1871 was performed by the Mayor of Rochdale, George Leach Ashworth, an Alderman and [[justice of the peace]], who had been instrumental in the changes made to the building's design.<ref name=link/>

[[Dry rot]] was found in the {{convert|240|ft|m|0|adj=on}} high spire in the early part of 1883 and contractors were engaged to make repairs following recommendation by Rochdale's Borough Surveyor.<ref name=link/> Without deciding upon the manner in which the spire should be replaced, Rochdale County Borough Council agreed to its temporary demolition. It was rumoured that the workmen who were dismantling the top section of the wooden spire may have tried to speed up the dismantling process with matches and at 9:20&nbsp;am on 10&nbsp;April 1883 a blaze was discovered. Despite the efforts of volunteers, 100&nbsp;minutes after the discovery of the fire the entire spire, including a statue of [[Saint George]], had been destroyed.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rochdaleobserver.co.uk/news/s/333/333151_the_1880s.html|publisher=rochdaleobserver.co.uk|title=The 1880s|work=Rochdale Observer| date=2003-06-13|accessdate=2010-01-16}}</ref> The cause of the fire was never definitively proven.<ref name=link/> A {{convert|191|ft|m|}} stone replacement, designed by [[Alfred Waterhouse]] in a similar style to the spire of [[Manchester Town Hall]], was built in 1888,<ref name=images/> but about {{convert|15|yd}} further to the east.<ref name=link/>

On 15 January 1931, at the height of the [[Great Depression in the United Kingdom]], the [[Territorial Army (United Kingdom)|Territorial Army]] was called to guard the Town Hall during a protest against unemployment and hunger.<ref>{{harvnb|Marwick|2000|p=110}}.</ref> In May 1938 Rochdale-born  actress, singer and comedienne [[Gracie Fields]] was granted [[Honorary Freedom of Boroughs Act 1885|Honorary Freedom of the Borough]] for her contribution to entertainment and "when the ceremony was over, Gracie went onto the town hall balcony to receive the cheers and good wishes of the thousands of people who were packing the streets below".<ref>{{harvnb|Moules|1983|pp=77<U+2013>78}}.</ref>

Although it is not fully understood how it came to his attention, Rochdale Town Hall was much admired by [[Adolf Hitler]]. It has been suggested a visit by Hitler in 1912-1913 while staying with his half-brother [[Alois Hitler, Jr.]] in [[Liverpool]], or military intelligence on Rochdale, or else information from Nazi sympathiser [[William Joyce]] (who had lived in [[Oldham]]), brought the building to his attention. Hilter admired the architecture so much that it is believed he wished to ship the building, brick-by-brick, to [[Nazi Germany]] had [[German-occupied Europe]] encompassed the [[United Kingdom]]. Rochdale was broadly avoided by German bombers during [[World War II]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rochdaleobserver.co.uk/community/nostalgia/s/518/518474_amazing_windows_always_a_glass_act.html|title=Amazing windows always a glass act|author=|publisher=rochdaleobserver.co.uk|work=Rochdale Observer |date=2006-10-07|accessdate=2007-12-22}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/local/manchester/hi/people_and_places/history/newsid_8256000/8256689.stm|publisher=news.bbc.co.uk|work=[[BBC News]]|title=Preserving the Rochdale Reichstag|date=2009-09-15|accessdate=2010-01-16}}</ref>

===Exterior and layout===
[[File:Rochdale Town Hall, 1909.jpg|thumb|right|alt=|Rochdale Town Hall, as it appeared in 1909]]
The frontage and principal entrance of the Town Hall faces towards the River Roch,<ref name=vision>{{cite web|url=http://www.visionofbritain.org.uk/descriptions/entry_page.jsp?text_id=948030&word=NULL|title=Descriptive Gazetteer entry for ROCHDALE|accessdate=2010-01-18|publisher=visionofbritain.org.uk|work=[[Imperial Gazetteer of England and Wales]]|year=1872|author=John Marius Wilson}}</ref> and comprises a [[portico]] of three arches intersected by buttresses. The ornamentation of the entrance consists of stone crockets, gargoyles, and finials, and, above a [[parapet]], are four gilded lions, the outer pair bearing shields with the coat of arms of Rochdale Council, and the inner pair those of the [[Salford (hundred)|hundred of Salford]] and [[Lancashire County Council]].<ref name=link/>

Rochdale Town Hall is {{convert|264|ft|m|0}} wide, {{convert|123|ft|m|0}} deep and is faced with [[Millstone Grit]] quarried from [[Blackstone Edge]] and [[Todmorden]],<ref name=link/> blackened by industrial pollution. The fa<U+00E7>ade, a "rich example of domestic Gothic architecture",<ref name=link/> has pointed arches, pinnacles and spires, great buttresses, clustered pillars and vaulted roofs.<ref name=link/>  [[Naturalism (arts)|Naturalistic]] carved foliage on the exterior recalls the style of [[Southwell Minster]],<ref name="images"/> and the architecture is influenced by [[English Gothic architecture#Perpendicular Gothic|Perpendicular Period]] and medieval town halls of [[continental Europe]].<ref name=link/>  The building has been likened to [[Manchester Town Hall]], [[Manchester Assize Courts]], the [[Royal Courts of Justice]], and [[St Pancras railway station]], all products of the Gothic Revival architectural movement.<ref name=link/>  The stained glass windows, some of which were designed by [[William Morris]],<ref name=images/> have been described as "the finest modern examples of their kind".<ref name="RMBC43"/> At each end of the frontage is an octagonal staircase.<ref name=vision/>

In the words of Nikolaus Pevsner, Rochdale Town Hall has "a splendidly craggy exterior of blackened stone";<ref>{{harvnb|Hartwell|Hyde|Pevsner|2004|p=594.}}</ref> the exterior is decorated with gilded lions which contrast with the dark stone. The building has a roughly symmetrical E-shaped plan, and is broken down into three self-contained segments: a central Great Hall and transverse wings at each end, which have variously been used as debating chambers, corporation-rooms, trade and a public hall.<ref name=vision/> The south-east wing used to house courts, and the north-west wing the mayor's rooms. In the north-east is a tower. Access to the main entrance is through a central [[Porte-cochere|porte cochere]].<ref>{{harvnb|Hartwell|Hyde|Pevsner|2004|pp=594&ndash;595.}}</ref>  The fa<U+00E7>ade extends across 14 [[Bay (architecture)|bays]], of which the Great Hall accounts for seven.  On both sides, the outermost bays rise to three storeys.  They flank asymmetric round-headed arcades<U+2014>two to the left and three to the right, all of single-storey height<U+2014>which sit below plain [[mullion]]ed windows, balconies and ornately decorated [[gables]].<ref name="images"/>
[[File:Rochdale Town Hall Clock.jpg|thumb|right|The [[clock tower]] was designed by [[Alfred Waterhouse]], the architect of [[Manchester Town Hall]].]]

===Clock tower===
The present [[clock tower]] is of simpler design than its predecessor, which was destroyed in the fire of 1883. It also differs from the original in that the spire or lantern is built of stone. <ref name=link/> The replacement tower was designed by [[Alfred Waterhouse]] in a similar style to one of his earlier works, the clock tower of [[Manchester Town Hall]]. The first stone was laid by Thomas Schofield [[Justice of the Peace|JP]], [[Alderman]] and Rochdale Borough [[Councillor]], on 19 October 1885 and the tower was declared complete on 20 June 1887, the [[Golden Jubilee]] of [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Queen Victoria]].<ref name=link/> The total height is {{convert|191|ft}}, {{convert|49|ft}} shorter than the former structure, but the clockface is still at the same height of {{convert|117|ft}} from the ground.<ref name=link/> There are five bells which announce the hours and the quarters.<ref name=link/>

The tower rises from a [[plinth]] and has four stages including the gable-headed clock stage, which is also decorated with pinnacles.  A small stone spire completes the composition.<ref name="images"/>

===Interior===
