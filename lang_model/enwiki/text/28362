The '''Battle of Roat<U+00E1>n''' (sometimes spelled "Rattan") was an [[American War of Independence]] battle fought on March 16, 1782, between British and Spanish forces for control of [[Roat<U+00E1>n]], an island off the [[Caribbean]] coast of present-day [[Honduras]].

A Spanish expeditionary force under [[Mat<U+00ED>as de G<U+00E1>lvez]], the [[Captain General]] of [[Captaincy General of Guatemala|Spanish Guatemala]], gained control of the British-held island after bombarding its main defences. The British garrison surrendered the next day.  The Spanish evacuated the captured soldiers, 135 civilians and 300 [[slaves]], and destroyed their settlement, which they claimed had been used as a base for [[piracy]] and [[privateering]].

The assault was part of a larger plan by G<U+00E1>lvez to eliminate British influence in Central America.  Although he met with temporary successes, the British were able to maintain a colonial presence in the area.

==Background==
{{further2|[[Spain in the American Revolutionary War]]}}
Following the entry of [[Spain]] into the [[American War of Independence]] in 1779, both Spain and [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Great Britain]] contested territories in [[Central America]].  Although most of the territory was part of the Spanish [[Captaincy General of Guatemala]], the British had established logging rights on the southern coast of the [[Yucatan Peninsula]] (present-day [[Belize]]), and had established informal settlements (lacking formal colonial authority) on the [[Mosquito Coast]] of present-day [[Honduras]] and [[Nicaragua]].  Guatemalan Governor [[Mat<U+00ED>as de G<U+00E1>lvez]] had moved quickly when the declaration of war arrived, [[Capture of Cayo Cocina|seizing St. George's Caye]], one of the principal British island settlements off the Yucatan coast.<ref name=C152>Ch<U+00E1>vez, p. 152</ref>  Many of the British fled that occupation to the island of [[Roat<U+00E1>n]], another British-controlled island about {{convert|40|mi|km}} off the Honduran coast.<ref>Bolland, p. 31</ref>  British commander [[Edward Marcus Despard]] used Roat<U+00E1>n as a base for guerilla-style operations to extend and maintain British influence on the Mosquito Coast, and for [[privateer]]ing operations against Spanish shipping.<ref>Oman, p. 5</ref>  (Sources do not indicate whether Despard was present on Roat<U+00E1>n at the time of the Spanish attack; if he was, he was probably not captured, since he continued to be active in the area. Stephens suggests that he was on [[Jamaica]] at the time.)<ref name=Stephens254/><ref>Oman, p. 6</ref>

[[File:Bay Islands - Roatan.PNG|thumb|left|Map of the [[Bay of Honduras]]; Roat<U+00E1>n is shown in red]]
G<U+00E1>lvez, who had been ordered by [[Charles III of Spain|King Charles]] to "dislocate the English from their hidden settlements on the Gulf of Honduras",<ref name=C151>Ch<U+00E1>vez, p. 151</ref> began planning offensive operations against the British mainland settlements as early as 1780, after the British abandoned their [[San Juan Expedition|failed expedition]] into Nicaragua.  He raised as many as 15,000 militia, and received financial and logistical support from many parts of the Spanish colonial empire in the Americas.  For logistical and diplomatic reasons, no operations were launched until after the American [[Siege of Yorktown|victory at Yorktown]] in October 1781.  The British loss opened the possibility that the British would be able to deploy troops to Central America to better defend the area.<ref>Floyd, pp. 154<U+2013>155</ref>  G<U+00E1>lvez' plans called for assaults on the British presence in the Bay Islands (principally Roat<U+00E1>n), followed by a sweep along the coast to eliminate the British from the mainland.  Troops from central Guatemala were staged in early 1782 at [[Trujillo, Col<U+00F3>n|Trujillo]] for the assault on Roat<U+00E1>n, while additional forces moved overland from Nicaragua, Honduras, and Salvador toward the principal British settlement of [[Black River (settlement)|Black River]].<ref>Floyd, p. 155</ref>

G<U+00E1>lvez arrived at Trujillo on March 8 to organise the assault on Roat<U+00E1>n.  Leaving a force of 600 at Trujillo to further harass the British and their partisan allies, he embarked another 600 troops onto transports, and sailed for Roat<U+00E1>n on March 12, escorted by three frigates (''Santa Matilde'', the ''Santa Cecilia'', and the ''Antiope'') and a number of smaller armed naval vessels,<ref>Ch<U+00E1>vez, pp. 162<U+2013>163</ref> under the command of Commodore Enrique Macdonell.<ref>Marley, p. 342</ref>

The British residents of Roat<U+00E1>n were aware of the ongoing Spanish military activities.  The main settlement, New Port Royal, was defended by Forts Dalling and Despard, which mounted 20 guns.  The island's white non-slave population was however quite small.  In 1781 they appealed to the British commander at [[Bluefields, Nicaragua|Bluefields]] for support, but he was only able to send additional weapons, which did not add significantly to the island's defenses.<ref name=Floyd157>Floyd, p. 157</ref>

==Battle==

The Spanish fleet arrived off Roat<U+00E1>n early on March 13, and, after its defenders fired several ineffectual cannon shots, anchored out of range while G<U+00E1>lvez sent a party in to request the surrender of the island's defenders.  The defenders asked for six hours to consider their options, which G<U+00E1>lvez granted.  After that time had elapsed, the defenders indicated that they were prepared to stand their ground, and refused to surrender.  Immediate attack was not possible due to high winds and rough seas, so G<U+00E1>lvez then held council, and a plan of attack was formulated.<ref name=C163>Ch<U+00E1>vez, p. 163</ref>

At about 10:15 am on March 16, Spanish guns opened up against Forts Dalling and Despard, which guarded the mouth of New Port Royal's harbour.  By 1:00 pm the British guns there had been silenced, and Major General [[Gabriel Herbias]] began landing troops.  After the two forts were secured, the Spanish warships entered the harbour and began raking the town with cannonfire, while British artillery fired back from positions in the hills above the town.  This exchange continued until sunset, at which point the British defenders capitulated.<ref name=C163/>  The Spanish had two killed and four wounded in the battle, while only two slaves were wounded on the other side.<ref name=Floyd157/>

==Aftermath==
Terms of surrender were agreed the next day.  G<U+00E1>lvez and his men remained on the island for several days, collecting weapons, rounding up slaves that had run away, destroying all the buildings and agriculture on the island, as well as burning many of the ships in the harbour, which they assumed to be used in smuggling and other illicit trade.<ref name=C163/>  The Spanish left the island on March 23, carrying as prisoners of war 81 British soldiers, 300 slaves, and 135 British civilians.<ref name=C164>Ch<U+00E1>vez, p. 164</ref>  The prisoners were sent to Havana, where the slaves were auctioned off and the others held until they could be exchanged.<ref name=Floyd157/>

G<U+00E1>lvez was able to only temporarily partially eliminate British influences in the area.  He followed up his success at Roat<U+00E1>n with the [[Battle of the Black River|capture]] of Black River in early April, but any attempt to advance further bogged down.  [[James Lawrie (British Army officer)|James Lawrie]], the commander at Black River, and Edward Marcus Despard successfully recaptured Black River, and were able to hold it until the end of the war.<ref name=C165>Ch<U+00E1>vez, p. 165</ref>
