The '''Foundation Stone''' ([[Hebrew language|Hebrew]]: <U+05D0><U+05D1><U+05DF> <U+05D4><U+05E9><U+05EA><U+05D9><U+05D9><U+05D4>, [[transliterated|translit.]] ''Even haShetiya'') or '''Rock''' ([[Arabic language|Arabic]]: [[transliterated|translit.]] ''Sakhrah'', [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]]: [[transliterated|translit.]]: ''Sela'') is the name of the rock at the heart of the [[Dome of the Rock]] in [[Jerusalem]]. It is also known as the '''Pierced Stone''' because it has a small hole on the southeastern corner that enters a cavern beneath the rock, known as the [[Well of Souls]]. It is the location of the [[Holy of Holies]] in the Temple, and is the holiest site in Judaism,{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}} as well as a holy site in Islam.{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}}

==Location==
The rock is located towards the centre of the [[Temple Mount]], an artificial platform built by [[Herod the Great]] on top of vaults over a hill, generally believed to be [[Moriah|Mount Moriah]]. The rock constitutes the peak of this now hidden hill, which is also the highest in early biblical Jerusalem, looming over the [[City of David]], and hence the rock is one of the highest points of the [[Old City (Jerusalem)|Old City]].

There is some controversy among secular scholars about equating Mount Moriah, the Temple Mount and the Foundation Stone as the location where events occurred according to the Biblical narrative.

Early Jewish writings assist in confirming that the [[Dome of the Rock]], completed in 691, is the site of the [[Kodesh Hakodashim|Holy of Holies]] and therefore the location of the Foundation Stone. [[Pirke De-Rabbi Eliezer]],<ref>Chapter 30.</ref> a [[midrashic]] narrative of the more important events of the [[Pentateuch]] believed to have been compiled in [[Italy]] shortly after 833 CE, writes: <U+201C>Rabbi [[Ishmael ben Elisha|Yishmael]] said: In the future, the sons of [[Ishmael]] (the Arabs) will do fifteen things in the [[Land of Israel]] <U+2026> They will fence in the breaches of the walls of the [[Temple in Jerusalem|Temple]] and ''construct a building on the site of the sanctuary''<U+201D>.

Religious Jewish scholars have discussed the precise location of the rock.  The [[Radbaz]] is convinced that <U+201C>under the dome on the Temple Mount, which the Arabs call El-Sakhrah, without a doubt is the location of the Foundation Stone<U+201D>.<ref>[[Responsa]] 691.</ref> The Travels of Rabbi [[Petachiah of Ratisbon]],<ref>A. Benisch, Travels of Petachia of Ratisbon (with English translation), London 1856.</ref>  c.[[1180]], The Travels of [[Benjamin of Tudela]]<ref>The Itinerary of Benjamin of Tudela: Travels in the Middle Ages; (English translation originally published by Joseph Simon/Pangloss Press in 1993, ISBN 0-934710-07-4).</ref> and The Travels of the Student of the [[Nahmanides|Ramban]] all equally state that "on the Temple Mount stands a beautiful sanctuary which an Arab king built long ago, over the place of the [[Temple in Jerusalem|Temple]] sanctuary and courtyard<U+201D>.  Rabbi [[Obadiah ben Abraham]] who wrote a letter from Jerusalem in 1488 says that <U+201C>I sought the place of the Foundation Stone where the [[Ark of the Covenant]] was placed, and many people told me it is under a tall and beautiful dome which the Arabs built in the Temple precinct".<ref>Avraham Ya'ari, ''Igrot Eretz Yisrael'', Ramat Gan 1971.</ref>

However, others disagree, citing that if the Southern Wall of the Temple Mount is in fact the one which existed when the Temple was standing, the measurements given in the [[Talmud]] do not reconcile.<ref>''Kaftor VeFerach''.</ref> The Holy of Holies ends up being too far north and they therefore locate the Foundation Stone as being directly opposite the current exposed section of the [[Western Wall]], where no building currently stands. This is the view of the [[Arizal]]<ref>''Emek HaMelech'', Preface, paragraph 9.</ref> and the [[Maharsha]],<ref>End of [[Makkot]].</ref> who state the prophesy that <U+201C>[[Zion]] will become a ploughed field<U+201D> indicates that no dwelling will be established there until the time of the redemption. It therefore follows that the area of the Temple courtyard and Holy of Holies is situated in the unbuilt area between the Dome of the Rock and the [[Al Aqsa Mosque]].[http://www.templemount.org/graphics/Fig6.html]

Some believe the position is north of the Dome of the Rock, opposite the [[Golden Gate (Jerusalem)|Gate of Mercy]], which Rabbi Emmanuel Chai Reiki<ref>''Aderes Eliyahu''.</ref> identifies as the Shushan Gate mentioned in the [[Talmud]]. This gate was described as being opposite the opening of the sanctuary.[http://www.templemount.org/graphics/Fig5.html]

Modern Jewish academics list four possible locations of the Foundation Stone:[http://www.templemount.org/tempmt.html]

# The stone is located beneath the Ark of the Covenant under the Dome of the Rock.[http://www.templemount.org/graphics/Fig4.html]
# The stone is located beneath the altar under the Dome of the Rock.[http://www.templemount.org/graphics/Fig3.html]
# The stone is located beneath the Ark of the Covenant near El Kas fountain to the south of the Dome of the Rock.[http://www.templemount.org/graphics/Fig6.html]
#The stone is located beneath the Ark of the Covenant inside the Spirits Dome situated to the north of the Dome of the Rock.[http://www.templemount.org/graphics/Fig5.html]

==Dimensions==
Although the rock is part of the surrounding [[bedrock]], the southern side forms a ledge, with a gap between it and the surrounding ground; a set of steps currently uses this gap to provide access from the Dome of the Rock to the Well of Souls beneath it.

The rock has several human-made cuts in its surface; these are generally attributed to the [[Crusades|Crusaders]], whose frequent damage to the rock was so severe that the [[Kingdom of Jerusalem|Christian kings of Jerusalem]] finally put a marble slab over the rock to protect it (the marble slab was later removed by [[Saladin]]). More recently, there has been speculation that several man-made features of the rock's surface may substantially predate the Crusaders. Archaeologist [[Leen Ritmeyer]] noticed that there are sections of the rock cut completely flat, which north-to-south have a width of 6 [[cubit]]s, precisely the width that the [[Mishnah]] credits to the wall of the Holy of Holies, and hence Ritmeyer proposed that these flat sections constitute ''foundation trenches'' on top of which the walls of [[Solomon's Temple|the original temple]] were laid. However, according to [[Josephus]] there were 31 steps up to the Holy of Holies from the lower level of the Temple Mount, and the Mishnah identifies 29 steps in total, and each step was half a cubit in height (according to the Mishnah); this is a height of at least 22 feet<U+2014>the height of the Sakhra is 21 feet above the lower level of the Temple Mount, and should therefore have been under the floor.

Nevertheless, taking the flat surface to be the position of the southern wall of a square enclosure, the west and north sides of which are formed by the low clean-cut ''scarp'' at these edges of the rock, at the position of the hypothetical centre is a rectangular cut in the rock that is about 2.5 cubits long and 1.5 cubits wide, which are exactly the dimensions of the Ark of the Covenant (according to the [[Book of Exodus]]).

The Mishnah<ref>[[Tractate]] [[Yoma]] 5:3.</ref> gives the height of the rock as three finger breadths above the ground. Radbaz<ref>[[Responsa]] (639).</ref> discusses the apparent contradiction of the Mishnah<U+2019>s measurements and the actual measurement of the rock within the Dome of the Rock which he estimates as the <U+201C>height of two men<U+201D> above the ground. He concluded that many changes in the natural configuration of the Temple Mount have taken place which can be attributed to excavations made by the various peoples who have occupied Jerusalem throughout the ages.

==Jewish significance==
[[Image:Even shetiya.jpg|thumb|250px|Postcard depicting the Foundation Stone, c1925.]]
{{Main|Temple in Jerusalem}}

This is the holiest site in Judaism. Jews all over the world pray towards the Foundation Stone.

The Roman-Era Midrash [[Tanchuma]]<ref>[[Kedoshim (parsha)|Kedoshim]] Ch.10.</ref> sums up the centrality of and holiness of this site in Judaism:

:''As the navel is set in the centre of the human body,
:''so is the land of Israel the navel of the world...
:''situated in the centre of the world,
:''and Jerusalem in the centre of the land of Israel,
:''and the sanctuary in the centre of Jerusalem,
:''and the holy place in the centre of the sanctuary,
:''and the ark in the centre of the holy place,
:''and the '''Foundation Stone''' before the holy place,
:''because from it the world was founded.''

(for comparison see [[omphalos]])

According to the sages of the [[Talmud]]<ref>[[Tractate]] [[Yoma]] 54b.</ref> it was from this rock that the world was created, itself being the first part of the Earth to come into existence. In the words of the [[Zohar]]:<ref>[[Vayechi]] 1:231.</ref> <U+201C>The world was not created until God took a stone called ''Even haShetiya'' and threw it into the depths where it was fixed from above till below, and from it the world expanded. It is the centre point of the world and on this spot stood the Holy of Holies<U+201D>.

According to the Talmud, it was close to here, on the site of the altar, that God gathered the earth that was formed into [[Adam (Bible)|Adam]]. It was on this rock that Adam<U+2014>and later [[Cain]], [[Abel]], and [[Noah]]<U+2014>offered sacrifices to God. Jewish sources identify this rock as the place mentioned in the [[Bible]] where [[Abraham]] fulfilled God's test to see if he would be willing to [[Binding of Isaac|sacrifice his son Isaac]]. The mountain is identified as Moriah in Genesis 22. It is also identified as the rock upon which [[Jacob]] dreamt about angels ascending and descending on a ladder and consequently consecrating and offering a sacrifice upon.

When, according to the Bible, [[King David]] purchased a threshing floor owned by [[Araunah]] the [[Jebusite]],<ref>[[1 Chronicles]] 21:25, and [[2 Samuel]] 24:18-25.</ref> it is believed that it was upon this rock that he offered the sacrifice mentioned in the verse. He wanted to construct a permanent temple there, but as his hands were "bloodied," he was forbidden to do so himself. The task was left to his son [[Solomon]], who completed the [[Solomon's Temple|Temple]] in c. 950 BCE.

The Mishnah in tractate [[Yoma]]<ref>Tractate Yoma 5:2.</ref> mentions a stone situated in the Holy of Holies that was called ''Shetiya'' and had been revealed by the early prophets, (i.e. David and [[Samuel (Bible)|Samuel]].<ref>[[Tractate]] [[Sotah]] 48b.</ref>)

An early [[Christian]] source noting Jewish attachment to the rock may be found in the [[Itinerarium Burdigalense|Bordeaux Pilgrim]], written between 333<U+2013>334 CE when Jerusalem was under [[Roman Empire|Roman]] rule, which describes a <U+201C><U+2026>perforated stone to which the Jews come every year and anoint it, bewail themselves with groans, rend their garments, and so depart.<U+201D> [http://198.62.75.1/www1/ofm/pilgr/bord/10Bord07aJerus.html#590]

===Role in the Temple===

Situated inside the Holy of Holies, this was the rock upon which the Ark of the Covenant was placed in the [[First Temple]].<ref>[[Zohar]] [[Vayechi]] 1:231; [[Midrash]] [[Tanchuma]] [[Acharei]] Ch.3 (see ''Etz Yosef'' commentary); [[Maimonides]], Beis HaBechirah 4:1.</ref>
During the [[Second Temple]] period when the Ark of the Covenant had been hidden, the stone was used by High Priest who offered up the incense and sprinkled the blood of the sacrifices on it during the [[Yom Kippur]] service.

===Commemoration in Jewish law===

The [[Jerusalem Talmud]]<ref>[[Pesachim]] 4:1.</ref> states:

"<U+05E0><U+05E9><U+05D9><U+05D9><U+05D0> <U+05D3><U+05E0><U+05D4><U+05D2><U+05DF> <U+05D3><U+05DC><U+05D0> <U+05DC><U+05DE><U+05D9>'''<U+05E9><U+05EA><U+05D9><U+05D9><U+05D4>''' <U+05E2><U+05DE><U+05E8><U+05D0> <U+05DE><U+05DF> <U+05D3><U+05D0><U+05D1> <U+05E2><U+05DC><U+05D9><U+05DC> <U+05DE><U+05E0><U+05D4><U+05D2> <U+2013> <U+05E9><U+05D1><U+05D5> <U+05E4><U+05E1><U+05E7><U+05D4> <U+05D0><U+05D1><U+05DF> '''<U+05E9><U+05EA><U+05D9><U+05D9><U+05D4>'''"

''"Women are accustomed not to prepare or attach [[Warp (weaving)|warp]] threads to a weaving [[loom]]''<ref>This follows the version recorded by [[Nissim Ben Jacob|Rav Nissim Gaon]].</ref> ''from [[Rosh Chodesh]] [[Av (month)|Av]] onwards (till after [[Tisha B'Av]]), because during the month of [[Av (month)|Av]] the Foundation Stone (and the [[Temple in Jerusalem|Temple]]) was destroyed"''.<ref>i.e. the stone became obsolete from its function in the Temple.</ref>

Citing this, the ''[[Mishnah Berurah]]''<ref>551:7, 8.</ref> rules that not only are women not to prepare or attach warp threads to a weaving [[loom]], but it is forbidden for anyone to make, buy or wear new clothes or shoes from the beginning of the week in which [[Tisha B'av]] falls until after the fast, and that people should ideally not do so from the beginning of [[Av (month)|Av]].

In further commemoration of the Foundation Stone, it is also forbidden to eat meat or drink wine from the beginning of the week in which Tisha B'av falls until after the fast. Some have the custom to refrain from these foodstuffs from [[Rosh Chodesh]] [[Av (month)|Av]], while others do so from the [[Seventeenth of Tammuz]].<ref>This is derived from the fact that another version of the same piece of Talmud reads: "<U+05DC><U+05DE><U+05D9><U+05E9><U+05EA><U+05D9><U+05D9><U+05D4> '''<U+05D7>'''<U+05DE><U+05E8><U+05D0>" <U+201C>(to refrain) from drinking wine<U+201D>. This follows the version recorded by [[Hai Gaon]]. It is brought down by the ''Kolbo, [[Halakha|Hilchos]] [[Tisha B'Av]]'', and ''[[Machzor Vitri]]'' 263.</ref>

===Liturgical references===

In the days when [[Selichot]] are recited, in the days leading up to [[Rosh Hashana]] until [[Yom Kippur]], the supplications include the following references:

==Muslim significance==

{{Main|Isra and Mi'raj}}

The stone has a  significance to Muslims, as they believe that the Prophet Muhammad stepped upon this stone  and rose to the heavens to receive a message and guidance from the creator, [[Allah]]. This is known by Muslims as the Journey of Al-Israa and Al-Mi'araj (night travel and rising up). [[Umar]] the 2nd [[Khalifah]] of the [[Muslims]] was led to the site of the Foundation Stone by a rabbi, [[Ka'ab al-Ahbar]], who had converted to [[Islam]]. The rock was surrounded by a fence, and several years later an Umayyad Caliph, [[Abd al-Malik|Abdel Malik Ibn Marawan]] built the [[Dome of the Rock]] over the site.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}}

For Muslims the whole area around the rock is named : Al-Haram Al-Qudsi (The Holy Sanctuary), which refers to the Temple Mount as it is mentioned in Qu'ran and Hadith.
