==Disinvestment efforts==
===United States===
;Presbyterian Church (USA)
In July 2004, the 2.4 million-member [[Presbyterian Church (USA)]], voted 431 to 62 in July to "initiate a process of phased selective divestment in multinational corporations operating in Israel."<ref name="Cooperman2004-09-29">{{cite news

According to the Church's highest elected official, Rev. [[Clifton Kirkpatrick]], there is no plan for a "blanket divestment" from Israeli companies, but instead the Church will "target businesses that it believes bear particular responsibility for the suffering of Palestinians and will give them a chance to change their behavior before selling their shares."<ref name="Cooperman2004-09-29"/>  Church officials, according to the [[Washington Post]]<ref name="Cooperman2004-09-29"/>, mentioned [[Caterpillar Inc.]] as a possible target of the selective divestment campaign because the company "manufactures bulldozers used by Israel to [[House_demolition_in_the_Israeli-Palestinian_conflict|demolish Palestinian homes]] that are built without permits or belong to families of suicide bombers."

There was significant opposition in the American Jewish community to the Church's decision.  The Washington Post reported in September 2004 that "Jewish-Presbyterian relations have been in turmoil" and that "the heads of several major U.S. Jewish organizations condemned the Presbyterian Church's decision to begin selective divestiture in companies operating in Israel."<ref name="Cooperman2004-09-29"/>  The executive vice president of the [[Central Conference of American Rabbis]], Rabbi [[Paul Menitoff]], said the resolution was "lopsided" and that it unfairly blamed only one side in the Palestinian-Israeli conflict.

In response to the criticism, Church official Kirkpatrick said that the Church would also "pull its money out of any companies that are complicit in supporting terrorism."<ref name="Cooperman2004-09-29"/>

On June 29 2006, the Presbyterian Church (USA) General Assembly by a vote of 483-28 adopted a balanced resolution that replaced language adopted in 2004 mandating a process of divestment focused on Israel - and endorsing instead a corporate engagement process.<ref>[http://pcusa.org/oga/newsstories/divestmentfaqpart2.pdf]</ref>  Instead of using the word "divestment", the resolution calls for the Church to invest only in companies who are involved in "peaceful pursuits" in Israel and Palestinian territories.<ref>[http://www.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1150355528268&pagename=JPost%2FJPArticle%2FShowFull Church adopts compromise resolution on Israel] by Nathan Guttman (''The Jerusalem Post'') June 19, 2006</ref>

The WCC planned to focus "on companies that assist Israel in [[House_demolition_in_the_Israeli-Palestinian_conflict|demolishing Palestinian homes]], constructing [[Israeli settlements|settlements]] and erecting a controversial '[[Separation barrier|dividing wall]]' within the Palestinian territories."<ref name="Eckstrom2005"/>

"The unexpected resolution", according to a BeliefNet report<ref name="Eckstrom2005"/>, "caught many American Jewish groups off guard and confirmed fears among some that the Presbyterians opened a Pandora's box last summer that now has the tacit approval of global Protestant and Orthodox leaders.  Rabbi Gary Bretton-Granatoor, interfaith director for the Anti-Defamation League, dismissed the WCC as 'irrelevant' but was nonetheless concerned that the divestment campaign has taken on a life of its own."

;United Church of Christ
[[United Church of Christ|The United Church of Christ]] also followed suit <ref>[http://www.ucc.org/synod/resolutions/gs25-15.pdf]</ref>,
endorsing a range of economic leverages that included divestment, but church leaders did not commit their pension or foundation assets to a divestment plan.<ref>[http://www.ucc.org/synod/resolutions/gs25-15.pdf].</ref>

;New England Conference of the United Methodist Church
The [[New England Conference]] of the [[United Methodist Church]], at its Annual Conference session held June 8-11, 2005, voted to urge the divesting of funds from companies that support the Israeli occupation of Palestinian Territories. <ref>[http://www.neumc.org/news_detail.asp?TableName=oNews_PJAYMY&PKValue=60]</ref>  The resolution stated:
* "Whereas the United Methodist Church should not profit from the illegal Israeli occupation of Palestinian land or the destruction of Palestinian homes, orchards, and lives,"
* "Whereas we are committed to ensuring that our denomination<U+2019>s money is used in a manner consistent with our beliefs, with [[international law]], and with [[Christ]]<U+2019>s teaching."

;Others
Other mainline churches have debated the subject of divestment.   The [[Evangelical Lutheran Church in America]] rejected a pro-divestment resolution during the summer of 2005.{{Fact|date=December 2007}}  The Episcopal Church USA ruled out the possibility of an Israel divestment later that year, and the United Methodist Church has also avoided divestment.{{Fact|date=December 2007}}

By a vote of 66 to 54, the annual delegate's meeting of Britain's largest trade union for journalists called for "a boycott of Israeli goods similar to those boycotts in the struggles against apartheid South Africa led by trade unions, and [for] the [Trades Union Congress] to demand sanctions be imposed on Israel by the British government." <ref>[http://www.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?pagename=JPost%2FJPArticle%2FShowFull&cid=1176152792457 UK reporters union to boycott Israel], Apr. 14, 2007, [[Jerusalem Post]]</ref>
