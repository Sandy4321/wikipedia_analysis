==Life and work==
Anatoliy Andreyevich Brandukov was born in [[Moscow]] on [[January 6]], [[1859]]. His father died soon after his birth, so he was raised by his mother and aunt. His first exposure to [[classical music]] was the [[Bolshoi Theatre|Bolshoi Theater]], in   which his sister performed. But the most   decisive influence on him was an 1867 performance of [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]]'s [[Symphony No. 5 (Beethoven)|fifth symphony]] by the [[Hector Berlioz]] Symphony Orchestra. He learned the [[cello]], and at age eight, began to attend [[Moscow Conservatory]].<ref name="lyudi" />  While there, he attracted the attention of professionals, professors, and the public.<ref name="sp" /> He became a student of [[Germans|German]] cello [[virtuoso]] Wilhelm Fitzenhagen, discussed [[music theory]] with [[Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky|Tchaikovsky]], and played in [[string quartet]]s with celebrity musicians.<ref name="t" /> He graduated in 1877 with the rare conservatory award, the Gold Medal.<ref name="sp" />

[[Image:Moscow Conservatory 1867.jpg|thumb|left|[[Moscow Conservatory]] in the mid-20th century.]] On [[March 5]], [[1878]], he gave his first solo concert, sponsored by [[Nikolai Grigoryevich Rubinstein|Nikolai Rubinstein]], but unable to secure a permanent audience, he went abroad.<ref name="lyudi" /> Although he had marginal success alone, he decided to go to the musical mecca of the time&mdash;[[Paris]]. From 1881 to 1889 he lived in [[France]], giving concerts in [[London]].<ref name="mir" /> Contemporary [[pianist]] and composer [[Alexander Borisovich Goldenweiser|Alexander Goldenweiser]] said of him, "His vivid, emotional performances were alien abstraction and judgment."<ref name="lyudi" /> He assisted writer [[Ivan Turgenev]], and through him made many friends and connections, among them pianists [[Anton Rubinstein]], [[Anna Yesipova]], and [[Alexander Siloti]], and conductor [[Leopold Auer]].<ref name="t" /> After a performance of [[Camille Saint-Sa<U+00EB>ns|Saint-Sa<U+00EB>ns]]' [[Cello Concerto No. 1 (Saint-Sa<U+00EB>ns)|Cello Concerto No. 1]] in 1881, he was invited to a celebratory concert highlighting his achievement in [[Angers]], [[France]]. 

[[Image:Brandukov and Tchaikovsky.jpg|thumb|Brandukov and Tchaikovsky, in Paris, 1888]] 
In 1890, Tchaikovsky urged the Moscow Conservatory to hire him as cello professor, but Director of the school [[Vasily Ilyich Safonov|Vasily Safonov]], denied, believing him too young for the job.<ref name="t" /> Brandukov spent time in [[Lausanne]], [[Switzerland]],<ref name="t" /> and helped nineteen-year old [[Sergei Rachmaninoff]] give his first independent concert, by playing some new works in his debut in 1892.<ref name="z" /> At this time he wrote fourteen pieces for cello, two for [[Violoncello concerto|cello and orchestra]].{{ref_label|B|b|none}}<ref>{{ru icon}} {{cite web |url=http://dic.academic.ru/dic.nsf/biograf2/1925 |title=Brandukov, Anatoliy Andreyevich |accessdate=2008-02-17 |date=2005 |work=Dictionaries and encyclopedias online at Academic.ru }}</ref>

In 1906, he was appointed professor and director of the [[Moscow Philharmonic Orchestra|Moscow Philharmonic]] School of Music and Drama, and became a professor at Moscow Conservatory in 1921,<ref name="mir" /> turning down an offer to work at the [[Accademia Nazionale di Santa Cecilia]].<ref name="p" /> One of his pupils was [[Ukrainians|Ukrainian]] cellist [[Gregor Piatigorsky]], who would go on to be hailed as "the last great Romantic."<ref name="grove">{{cite web |url=http://www.grovemusic.com/shared/views/article.html?section=music.21650 |title=Piatigorsky, Gregor |accessdate=2007-10-30 |author=Schwarz, Boris |date=2007 |work=[[Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians]] Online }}</ref> In Moscow he married the wealthy Nadezhda Mazurina and had a son, Sasha. During the [[World War I]], which started in 1914, he often spoke at [[Charity (practice)|charity]] events for wounded soldiers. As a professor, he enjoyed interacting with his students on a very personal level. A student, known only as A. V. Brouna, commented that, "Brandukov was not a teacher in the conventional sense. This was a close friend, generously spreading his spiritual wealth, whose lessons became a revelation..."<ref name="t" /> After the 1917 [[October Revolution]], he became a member of the Bolshoi Theater, organizing the [[symphony orchestra]] and speaking at concert events.<ref name="lyudi" /> [[Heinrich Neuhaus]], one of his partners at the Theater reported that in 1919, on the way to a concert, Brandukov slipped and fell on his cello. When the cover was removed, Neuhaus recalls, Brandukov "embraced his cello, as a living creature, tears and tears from his eyes."<ref name="t" /> 

In his later years, he continued to perform and give lectures, last speaking with Neuhaus on [[January 30]], [[1930]].<ref>{{ru icon}} {{cite web |url=http://www.zavtra.ru/cgi//veil//data/zavtra/97/198/84.html |title=Dedicated to the memory of the twentieth-century great pianist Sviatoslav Teofilovich Richter |accessdate=2007-10-29 |author=Elena Antonova  |date=[[1997-09-16]] |work=Notes on Russian Pianism }}</ref> He died in Moscow in [[February 13]], [[1930]], aged 71.<ref name="t" />

Brandukov had a beneficial relationship with the composer, [[Sergei Rachmaninoff]]. In Rachmaninoff's first independent concert on [[February 11]], [[1892]], Brandukov performed his [[Trio El<U+00E9>giaque No. 1 (Rachmaninoff)|''Trio el<U+00E9>giaque'' No.&nbsp;1]] (1892) and a cello-piano [[Transcription (music)|transcription]] of the ''Pr<U+00E9>lude'' of his ''Pr<U+00E9>lude et Danse orientale'' (Op.&nbsp;2).<ref name="pic">{{cite book |last=Norris |first=Geoffrey |title=The Master Musicians: Rachmaninoff |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=aPc2AAAACAAJ |year=1993 |publisher=[[G.

[[Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky]] was instrumental in securing Brandukov's success. Tchaikovsky greatly admired Brandukov's playing, and in the summer of 1887 sent a few pages of the ''[[Pezzo Capriccioso (Tchaikovsky)|Pezzo Capriccioso]]'' to him for his opinion. He modified it without consulting the composer, and gave the Paris premiere in 1888.<ref name="g" /> It was published in this form, dedicated to Brandukov.<ref name="grove" />{{ref_label|C|c|none}}
