'''James Douglas "Jim" Morrison''' (December 8, 1943 &mdash; July 3, 1971) was the [[lead singer]] and [[lyricist]] of American band [[The Doors]].<ref name="climate">"[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/6316743.stm ''See e.g.'', Morrison poem backs climate plea]", ''[[BBC News]]'', January 31, 2007.</ref> He also wrote poetry<ref name="climate">"http://www.huddersfield1.co.uk/poetry/morrisonpoetry.htm, ''huddersfield'',</ref>  <ref>[http://www.biography.com/search/article.do?id=9415576 Biography of Jim Morrison.]</ref> Morrison was ranked number 47 on ''[[Rolling Stone (magazine)|Rolling Stone's]]'' "100 Greatest Singers of All Time"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rollingstone.com/news/coverstory/greatestsingers/page/47 |title=100 Greatest Singers of All Time |work=[[Rolling Stone]] |accessdate=2009-06-15}}</ref> and is widely regarded{{Who|date=November 2010|reason=needs source to support this broad statement}} as one of the most iconic frontmen in [[rock music]] history.

==Early years==
James Douglas Morrison was born in [[Melbourne, Florida]], to future Admiral [[George Stephen Morrison]] and Clara Morrison. Morrison had a sister, Anne Robin, who was born in 1947 in [[Albuquerque, New Mexico]]; and a brother, Andrew Lee Morrison, who was born in 1948 in [[Los Altos, California]]. He was of [[Irish people|Irish]] and [[Scottish people|Scottish]] descent.<ref>"[http://www.thebiographychannel.co.uk/biography_story/1930:2450/1/Jim_Morrison.htm Dead Famous: Jim Morrison]". ''[[The Biography Channel]]''. Retrieved December 2, 2007.</ref> Morrison reportedly had an [[I.Q.]] of 149.<ref>{{Citation |last=Riordan |first=James |title=Break on Through: The Life and Death of Jim Morrison |publisher=[[HarperCollins]] |year=1992 |page=32 |quote=In school, Morrison was tested as having a genius I.Q. of 149. |isbn=0688119158}}</ref><ref>{{Citation |last=Walters |first=Glenn D.  |title=Lifestyle Theory: Past, Present And Future |publisher=[[Nova Publishers]] |year=2006 |page=78 |isbn=1600210333}}</ref>

In 1947, Morrison, then four years old, allegedly witnessed a [[car accident]] in the [[desert]], where a family of [[American Indians]] were injured and possibly killed. He referred to this incident in a [[spoken word]] performance on the song "Dawn's Highway" from the album ''[[An American Prayer]]'', again in the songs "[[Peace Frog]]", "[[Ghost Song]]".

Morrison believed the incident to be the most formative event in his life,<ref>{{Citation | last=Davis |first=Stephen |title=Jim Morrison: Life, Death, Legend |publisher=[[Ebury Press]] |year=2004 | page=8 |quote=It was the first time I discovered death, he recounted many years later, as the tape rolled in a darkened West Hollywood Recording studio. |isbn=9780091900427}}</ref> and made repeated references to it in the imagery in his songs, poems, and interviews. His family does not recall this incident happening in the way he told it. According to the Morrison biography ''[[No One Here Gets Out Alive]]'', Morrison's family did drive past a car accident on an [[Indian reservation]] when he was a child, and he was very upset by it. The book ''The Doors'', written by the remaining members of The Doors, explains how different Morrison's account of the incident was from the account of his father. This book quotes his father as saying, "We went by several Indians. It did make an impression on him [the young James]. He always thought about that crying Indian." This is contrasted sharply with Morrison's tale of "Indians scattered all over the highway, bleeding to death". In the same book, his sister is quoted as saying, "He enjoyed telling that story and exaggerating it. He said he saw a dead Indian by the side of the road, and I don't even know if that's true."

With his father in the [[United States Navy]], Morrison's family moved often. He spent part of his childhood in [[San Diego, California]]. In 1958, Morrison attended [[Alameda High School]] in [[Alameda, California]]. He graduated from George Washington High School (now [[George Washington Middle School (Virginia)|George Washington Middle School]]) in [[Alexandria, Virginia]], in June 1961. His father was also stationed at [[Naval Station Mayport|Mayport Naval Air Station]] in [[Jacksonville, Florida]].

Morrison went to live with his paternal grandparents in [[Clearwater, Florida]], where he attended classes at [[St. Petersburg Junior College]]. In 1962, he transferred to [[Florida State University]] (FSU) in [[Tallahassee, Florida|Tallahassee]], where he appeared in a school recruitment film.<ref name="fsufilm">{{cite web| title = Recruitment Film | url=http://www.floridamemory.com/PhotographicCollection/video/video.cfm?VID=10 | accessdate = 2008-08-24 }}</ref> While attending FSU, Morrison was arrested for a prank, following a home [[American football|football]] game.<ref name="FSU arrest">{{cite web| title = FSU Arrest | url=http://www.americanlegends.com/Interviews/morrison.htm | accessdate = 2008-06-24}}</ref>

In January 1964, Morrison moved to [[Los Angeles, California]], to attend the [[University of California, Los Angeles]] (UCLA). He attended [[Jack Hirschman]]'s class on [[Antonin Artaud]] in the Comparative Literature program within the UCLA English Department. Artaud's brand of [[surrealist]] theatre had a profound impact on Morrison's dark poetic sensibility of cinematic theatricality.  Hirschman was then an Assistant Professor of English at UCLA, an author, published poet and collegial contemporary of [[Michael McClure]], [[Lawrence Ferlinghetti]], [[Philip Lamantia]], [[Bob Kaufman]], among others. Morrison was later to meet Michael McClure and together to envisage the Poetic Dream.<ref>[http://archives.waiting-forthe-sun.net/Pages/Legacy/Poetry/McClure.html Michael McClure on Jim Morrison and Poetry].

Morrison completed his [[undergraduate]] degree at UCLA's film school and the Theater Arts department of the College of Fine Arts in 1965. He made two films while attending UCLA. ''First Love'', the first of these films, made with Morrison's classmate and roommate Max Schwartz, was released to the public when it appeared in a documentary about the film ''Obscura''. During these years, while living in [[Venice, Los Angeles, California|Venice Beach]], he became friends with writers at the ''[[Los Angeles Free Press]]''. Morrison was an advocate of the underground newspaper until his death in 1971.<ref>Goldsmith, Melissa Ursula Dawn.

==The Doors==
{{Main|The Doors}}
In 1965, after graduating from UCLA, Morrison led a [[bohemianism|bohemian]] lifestyle in Venice Beach. Morrison and fellow UCLA student [[Ray Manzarek]] were the first two members of The Doors. Shortly thereafter, drummer [[John Densmore]] and guitarist [[Robby Krieger]] joined. Krieger auditioned at Densmore's recommendation and was then added to the lineup.

The Doors took their name from the title of [[Aldous Huxley]]'s ''[[The Doors of Perception]]'' (a reference to the "unlocking" of "doors of perception" through [[psychedelic drug]] use), Huxley's own title was a quotation from [[William Blake]]'s ''[[The Marriage of Heaven and Hell]]'', in which Blake wrote that "If the doors of perception were cleansed everything would appear to man as it is, infinite."

Although Morrison is known as the lyricist for the group, Krieger also made significant lyrical contributions, writing or co-writing some of the group's biggest hits, including "[[Light My Fire]]", "[[Love Me Two Times]]", "[[Love Her Madly]]" and "[[Touch Me (The Doors song)|Touch Me]]".<ref>{{Citation |last=Getlen |first=Larry |title=Opportunity Knocked So The Doors Kicked It Down |url=http://www.bankrate.com/brm/news/investing/20030616a1.asp |accessdate=2008-08-24}}</ref>

In June 1966, Morrison and The Doors were the opening act at the [[Whisky a Go Go]] on the last week of the residency of [[Van Morrison]]'s band [[Them (band)|Them]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://archives.waiting-forthe-sun.net/Pages/Venues/whisky_them.html|author=Lawrence, Paul (2002)|title=The Doors and Them: Twin Morrisons of Different Mothers|publisher=waiting-forthe-sun.net|accessdate=2008-07-07}}</ref> Van's influence on Jim's developing stage performance was later noted by John Densmore in his book ''Riders On The Storm'': "Jim Morrison learned quickly from his near-namesake's stagecraft, his apparent recklessness, his air of subdued menace, the way he would improvise poetry to a rock beat, even his habit of crouching down by the bass drum  during instrumental breaks."<ref name="HintonPage67">Hinton (1997), page 67.</ref> On the final night, the two Morrisons and the two bands jammed together on "[[Gloria (Them song)|Gloria]]".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chickenonaunicycle.com/Whisky-A-Go-Go%20History.htm|author=Corry Arnold|date=2006-01-23|title=The History of the Whisky-A-Go-Go|publisher=chickenonaunicyle.com |accessdate=2008-06-30}}</ref><ref name="VanM">{{cite web |url=http://www.harbour.sfu.ca/~hayward/van/glossary/doors.html |title= Glossary entry for The Doors |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070310195120/http://www.harbour.sfu.ca/~hayward/van/glossary/doors.html |archivedate=2007-03-10}} from Van Morrison website.

The Doors achieved national recognition after signing with [[Elektra Records]] in 1967.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Leopold |first=Todd |date=April 20, 2007|title=Confessions of a Record Label Owner |url=http://www.cnn.com/2007/SHOWBIZ/Music/04/19/holzman.elektra/index.html |accessdate=November 18, 2010| work=[[CNN]]}}</ref> The single "[[Light My Fire]]" eventually reached number one on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' Pop Singles chart.<ref>{{Dead link|date=November 2010}} {{Cite news |last= |first= |title=Light My Fire |url=http://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/6595880/light_my_fire |publisher=''[[Rolling Stone]]''|accessdate=2008-08-24}}</ref>  Later, The Doors appeared on ''[[The Ed Sullivan Show]]'', a popular Sunday night variety series that had introduced [[The Beatles]] and [[Elvis Presley]] to the nation. [[Ed Sullivan]] requested two songs from The Doors for the show, "[[People Are Strange]]", and "[[Light My Fire]]". The censors insisted that they change the lyrics of "Light My Fire" from "Girl we couldn't get much higher" to "Girl we couldn't get much better"; this was reportedly due to what could be perceived as a reference to drugs in the original lyric. Giving assurances of compliance to Sullivan, Morrison then proceeded to sing the song with the original lyrics anyway. He later said that he had simply forgotten to make the change. This so infuriated Sullivan that he refused to shake their hands after their performance and told Morrison they would never play ''The Ed Sullivan Show'' again. Morrison retorted, "Who cares, we already did".

In 1967, Morrison and The Doors produced a promotional film for "[[Break On Through (To the Other Side)]]", which was their first [[single (music)|single]] release. The video featured the four members of the group playing the song on a darkened set with alternating views and close-ups of the performers while Morrison lip-synched the lyrics. Morrison and The Doors continued to make music videos, including "[[The Unknown Soldier (song)|The Unknown Soldier]]", "[[Moonlight Drive]]", and "[[People Are Strange]]".

By the release of their second album, ''[[Strange Days (album)|Strange Days]]'', The Doors had become one of the most popular rock bands in the United States. Their blend of [[blues]] and rock tinged with [[psychedelic|psychedelia]] included a number of original songs and distinctive cover versions, such as their rendition of "[[Alabama Song]]", from [[Bertolt Brecht]] and [[Kurt Weill]]'s [[operetta]], ''[[Rise and Fall of the City of Mahagonny]]''. The band also performed a number of extended concept works, including the songs "[[The End (The Doors song)|The End]]", "[[When the Music's Over]]", and "[[Celebration of the Lizard]]".

In 1967, photographer Joel Brodsky took a series of [[Photography#Black-and-white|black-and-white]] photos of Morrison, in a photo shoot known as "The Young Lion" photo session. These photographs are considered among the most iconic images of Jim Morrison and are frequently used as covers for compilation albums, books, and other memorabilia of the Doors and Morrison.<ref>{{Dead link|date=May 2010}}[http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/n/a/2007/03/31/national/a121306D56.DTL "Photographer Joel Brodsky Dies"].  ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]''.</ref>
<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Jimlaughingw-dogs.jpg|left|thumb|150px]] -->
In 1968, The Doors released their third studio album, ''[[Waiting for the Sun]]''. Their fourth album, ''[[The Soft Parade]]'', was released in 1969. It was the first album where the individual band members were given credit on the inner sleeve for the songs they had written.

After this, Morrison started to show up for recording sessions inebriated. He was also frequently late for live performances. As a result, the band would play instrumental music or force Manzarek to take on the singing duties.

By 1969, the formerly svelte singer gained weight, grew a beard, and began dressing more casually &mdash; abandoning the leather pants and concho belts for slacks, jeans and T-shirts.

During a 1969 concert at the [[Dinner Key Auditorium]] in [[Miami]], Morrison attempted to spark a riot in the audience. He failed, but a [[arrest warrant|warrant]] for his arrest was issued by the [[Miami-Dade Police Department|Dade County Police department]] three days later for [[indecent exposure]]. Consequently, many of The Doors' scheduled concerts were canceled.<ref>{{Citation |last= |first= |title=The Doors: Biography: Rolling Stone |url=http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/thedoors/biography |accessdate=2008-08-24}}{{Dead link|date=September 2010}}</ref> In the years following the incident, Morrison was exonerated. In 2007 [[List of Governors of Florida|Florida Governor]] [[Charlie Crist]] suggested the possibility of a posthumous [[pardon]] for Morrison.<ref>{{Cite news |last= |first= |title=Dead Rock Star To Get Pardon? |url=http://www.wltx.com/fyi/story.aspx?storyid=48833 |publisher=[[WLTX]]|accessdate=September 9, 2007}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref> See also [[The Doors#Miami incident|Miami incident]].

Following ''The Soft Parade'', The Doors released the ''[[Morrison Hotel]]'' album. After a lengthy break the group reconvened in October 1970 to record their last album with Morrison, ''[[L.A. Woman]]''.  Shortly after the recording sessions for the album began, producer [[Paul A. Rothchild]] &mdash; who had overseen all their previous recordings &mdash; left the project. Engineer [[Bruce Botnick]] took over as producer.

==Solo: poetry and film==
Morrison began writing in adolescence. In college, he studied the related fields of [[theater]], [[film]], and [[cinematography]].<ref>{{Citation |last= |first= |title=Notable Actors &mdash; UCLA School of Theater, Film and Television|url=http://www.tft.ucla.edu/alumni/notable-actors/ |accessdate=2008-12-03}}</ref>

He self-published two volumes of his poetry in 1969, ''The Lords / Notes on Vision'' and ''The New Creatures''. ''The Lords'' consists primarily of brief descriptions of places, people, events and Morrison's thoughts on cinema. ''The New Creatures'' verses are more poetic in structure, feel and appearance. These two books were later combined into a single volume titled ''The Lords and The New Creatures''. These were the only writings published during Morrison's lifetime.

Morrison befriended [[Beat generation|Beat Poet]] [[Michael McClure]], who wrote the [[afterword]] for [[Danny Sugerman]]'s biography of Morrison, ''[[No One Here Gets Out Alive]]''. McClure and Morrison reportedly collaborated on a number of unmade film projects, including a film version of McClure's infamous play ''[[The Beard]]'', in which Morrison would have played [[Billy the Kid]].<ref>{{Citation |last=McClure |first=Michael |title=Michael McClure Recalls an Old Friend |url=http://archives.waiting-forthe-sun.net/Pages/Players/Personal/mcclure_recalls.html |accessdate=2008-09-09}}</ref>

After his death, two volumes of Morrison's poetry were published. The contents of the books were selected and arranged by Morrison's friend, photographer Frank Lisciandro, and girlfriend [[Pamela Courson]]'s parents, who owned the rights to his poetry. ''The Lost Writings of Jim Morrison'' Volume 1 is titled ''[[Wilderness]],'' and, upon its release in 1988, became an instant ''[[New York Times]]'' best seller. Volume 2, ''[[American Night|The American Night]],'' released in 1990, was also a success.

Morrison recorded his own poetry in a professional sound studio on two separate occasions. The first was in March 1969 in Los Angeles and the second was on December 8, 1970. The latter recording session was attended by Morrison's personal friends and included a variety of sketch pieces. Some of the segments from the 1969 session were issued on the [[bootleg recording|bootleg]] album ''[[The Lost Paris Tapes]]'' and were later used as part of the Doors' ''[[An American Prayer]]'' album, released in 1978. The album reached number 54 on the music charts. The poetry recorded from the December 1970 session remains unreleased to this day and is in the possession of the Courson family.

Morrison's best-known but seldom seen cinematic endeavor is ''[[HWY: An American Pastoral]]'', a project he started in 1969. Morrison financed the venture and formed his own production company in order to maintain complete control of the project. [[Paul Ferrara]], Frank Lisciandro and Babe Hill assisted with the project. Morrison played the main character, a hitch hiker turned killer/car thief. Morrison asked his friend, composer/pianist Fred Myrow, to select the [[soundtrack]] for the film.<ref>{{Citation |last=Unterberger |first=Richie |title=Liner Notes for Diane Hildebrand's "Early Morning Blues and Greens |url=http://www.richieunterberger.com/diane.html |accessdate=2008-08-24}}</ref><ref>{{Citation |last= |first= |title=HWY: An American Pastoral |url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0388097/combined |accessdate=2008-08-24}}</ref>

==Personal life==
===Morrison's family===
Morrison's early life was a [[Military brat (U.S. subculture)|nomadic existence typical of military families]].<ref>{{Citation |last= |first= |title=Jim Morrison Biography |url=http://www.thebiographychannel.co.uk/biography_story/1930:2450/1/Jim_Morrison.htm |accessdate=2008-08-24}}</ref> Jerry Hopkins recorded Morrison's brother, Andy, explaining that his parents had determined never to use [[corporal punishment]] on their children. They instead instilled discipline and levied punishment by the military tradition known as "dressing down". This consisted of yelling at and berating the children until they were reduced to tears and acknowledged their failings.

Once Morrison graduated from UCLA, he broke off most of his family contact. By the time Morrison's music ascended to the top of the charts in 1967 he had not been in communication with his family for more than a year and falsely claimed that his parents and siblings were dead (or claiming, as it has been widely misreported, that he was an only child). This misinformation was published as part of the materials distributed with The Doors' [[The Doors (album)|self-titled debut album]].

In a letter to the Florida Probation and Parole Commission District Office dated October 2, 1970, Morrison's father acknowledged the breakdown in family communications as the result of an argument over his assessment of his son's musical talents. He said he could not blame his son for being reluctant to initiate contact and that he was proud of him nonetheless.<ref name="fatherletter">[http://www.idafan.com/FloridaProbation-ParoleLetters.htm Letter from Jim's Father to probation department 1970]</ref>

George Morrison was not in support of his son's career choice in music. One day, an acquaintance brought over a record thought to have Jim on the cover. The record was the [[The Doors (album)|Doors self-titled debut]]. The young man played the record for Morrison's father and family. After hearing the record, Jim's father wrote Jim a letter telling him "to give up any idea of singing or any connection with a music group because of what I considered to be a complete lack of talent in this direction."<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.idafan.com/cleveland_plain_dealer-exhbit-preview.html | title = Love Them Two Times | accessdate = 2010-05-18 | last = Soeder | first = John | date = 2007-05-20 | work = Plain Dealer}}</ref>

===Women in his life===
Morrison met his long-term companion,<ref>{{Cite news |last=Hoover |first=Elizabeth D. |date=July 3, 2006|title=The Death of Jim Morrison |url=http://www.americanheritage.com/entertainment/articles/web/20060703-jim-morrison-doors-drugs-rock-n-roll-aldous-huxley-paris-heroin-pamela-courson.shtml |publisher=''[[American Heritage (magazine)|American Heritage]]''|accessdate=November 18, 2010}}</ref> [[Pamela Courson]], well before he gained any fame or fortune,<ref>{{Citation |last= |first= |title=Jim Morrison Biography |url=http://www.thebiographychannel.co.uk/biography_story/1930:2450/4/Jim_Morrison.htm |accessdate=2008-08-24}}</ref> and she encouraged him to develop his poetry. At times, Courson used the surname "Morrison" with his apparent consent or at least lack of concern. After Courson's death on April 25, 1974, the [[probate]] court in California decided that she and Morrison had what qualified as a [[common-law marriage]] (see below, under "Estate Controversy").

Morrison's and Courson's relationship was a stormy one, with frequent loud arguments and periods of separation. Biographer [[Danny Sugerman]] surmised that part of their difficulties may have stemmed from a conflict between their respective commitments to an [[open relationship]] and the consequences of living in such a relationship.

In 1970, Morrison participated in a [[Celtic Neopaganism|Celtic Pagan]] [[handfasting]] ceremony with rock critic and [[science fiction]]/[[fantasy]] author [[Patricia Kennealy-Morrison|Patricia Kennealy]]. Before witnesses, one of them a [[Presbyterian]] [[Minister (Christianity)|minister]],<ref name="pkm1">{{Citation | first =Patricia | last =Kennealy | authorlink = Patricia Kennealy-Morrison| year =1992 | month = | title =Strange Days: My Life With And Without Jim Morrison  | chapter = | editor = | others = | edition = | page =63 | publisher =Dutton/Penguin | location =New York| isbn =0-525-93419-7 | url = }}</ref> the couple signed a document declaring themselves wedded,<ref name="pkm2">Kennealy (1992) plate 7, p.175</ref> but none of the necessary paperwork for a legal marriage was filed with the state. Kennealy discussed her experiences with Morrison in her autobiography ''Strange Days: My Life With and Without Jim Morrison'' in an interview reported in the book ''Rock Wives''.

Morrison also regularly had sex with fans and had numerous short flings with women who were celebrities, including [[Nico]], the singer associated with [[The Velvet Underground]], a [[one night stand]] with singer [[Grace Slick]] of [[Jefferson Airplane]], an on-again-off-again relationship with ''[[16 Magazine]]'''s [[Gloria Stavers]] and an alleged alcohol-fueled encounter with [[Janis Joplin]]. Judy Huddleston also recalls her relationship with Morrison in ''Living and Dying with Jim Morrison''. At the time of his death there were reportedly as many as 20 [[Paternity (law)|paternity]] actions pending against him, although no claims were made against his estate by any of the putative paternity claimants.

Morrison died on July 3, 1971. In the official account of his death, he was found in a Paris apartment bathtub by Courson. Pursuant to French law, no [[autopsy]] was performed because the [[medical examiner]] claimed to have found no evidence of [[crime|foul play]]. The absence of an official autopsy has left many questions regarding Morrison's [[Cause of death#Causes of human death|cause of death]].

In ''Wonderland Avenue'', [[Danny Sugerman]] discussed his encounter with Courson after she returned to the U.S. According to Sugerman's account, Courson stated that Morrison had died of a [[heroin]] [[drug overdose|overdose]], having inhaled what he believed to be [[cocaine]]. Sugerman added that Courson had given numerous contradictory versions of Morrison's death, at times saying that she had killed Morrison, or that his death was her fault. Courson's story of Morrison's unintentional ingestion of heroin, followed by accidental overdose, is supported by the confession of Alain Ronay, who has written that Morrison died of a [[hemorrhage]] after snorting Courson's heroin, and that Courson nodded off, leaving Morrison bleeding to death instead of phoning for medical help.<ref name="Ronay">Ronay, Alain (2002). [http://archives.waiting-forthesun.net/Pages/Articles/jims_last_days.html "Jim and I - Friends until Death"]. Originally published in ''[[King (magazine)|King]]''.  Retrieved December 25, 2007.</ref>

Ronay confessed in an article in ''[[Paris Match]]'' that he then helped cover up the circumstances of Morrison's death.<ref name="Ronay2">Kennealy (1992) pp: 385&ndash;392 quotes from Ronay's interview in ''[[Paris Match]]''.</ref> In the epilogue of ''No One Here Gets Out Alive'', Hopkins and Sugerman write that Ronay and [[Agn<U+00E8>s Varda]] say Courson lied to the police who responded at the death scene, and later in her deposition, telling them Morrison never took drugs.

In the epilogue to ''No One Here Gets Out Alive'', Hopkins says that 20 years after Morrison's death, Ronay and Varda broke silence and gave this account: They arrived at the house shortly after Morrison's death and Courson said that she and Morrison had taken heroin after a night of drinking. Morrison had been coughing badly, had gone to take a bath, and vomited blood. Courson said that he appeared to recover and that she then went to sleep. When she awoke sometime later Morrison was unresponsive, and so she called for medical assistance.

Courson herself died of a heroin overdose three years later. Like Morrison, she was 27 years old at the time of her death.

In the epilogue of ''No One Here Gets Out Alive'', Hopkins and Sugerman also claim that Morrison had [[asthma]] and was suffering from a [[respiratory system|respiratory]] condition involving a chronic cough and throwing up blood on the night of his death. This theory is partially supported in ''The Doors'' (written by the remaining members of the band) in which they claim Morrison had been coughing up blood for nearly two months in Paris. None of the members of the Doors were in Paris with Morrison in the months before his death.

In the first version of ''No One Here Gets Out Alive'' published in 1980, Sugerman and Hopkins gave some credence to the rumor that Morrison may not have died at all, calling the fake death theory <U+201C>not as far-fetched as it might seem<U+201D>.<ref>Hopkins, Jerry; Sugerman, Danny. ''No One Here Gets Out Alive''. pg. 373.</ref> This theory led to considerable distress for Morrison's loved ones over the years, notably when fans would [[stalking|stalk]] them, searching for evidence of Morrison's whereabouts.<ref name="sugerman">Hopkins, Jerry; Sugerman, Danny (1980).

In a July 2007 newspaper interview, a self-described close friend of Morrison's, [[:fr:Sam Bernett|Sam Bernett]], resurrected an old rumor and announced that Morrison actually died of a heroin overdose in the [[Rock 'n' Roll Circus]] nightclub, on the [[Left Bank]] in Paris. Bernett claims that Morrison came to the club to buy heroin for Courson then did some himself and died in the bathroom. Bernett alleges that Morrison was then moved back to the rue Beautreillis apartment and dumped in the bathtub by the same two drug dealers from whom Morrison had purchased the heroin.

====Grave site====
Morrison is buried in the [[P<U+00E8>re Lachaise Cemetery]] in Paris, one of the city's most visited tourist attractions. The grave had no official marker until French officials placed a shield over it, which was stolen in 1973. In 1981, [[Croatian people|Croatian]] sculptor Mladen Mikulin placed a bust of Morrison and the new gravestone with Morrison's name at the grave to commemorate the 10th anniversary of his death;<ref name="Mikulin1">[http://www.ars-cartae.com/GAmm0000.htm Mladen Mikulin - Sculptor]</ref> the bust was defaced through the years by cemetery vandals and later stolen in 1988.<ref name="Mikulin2">[http://www.ars-cartae.com/GAmmsk04.htm photo of defaced bust on Morrison's grave before it was stolen].</ref> In the 1990s Morrison's father, [[George Stephen Morrison]], placed a flat stone on the grave. The stone bears the [[Greek language|Greek]] inscription: <U+039A><U+0391><U+03A4><U+0391> <U+03A4><U+039F><U+039D> <U+0394><U+0391><U+0399><U+039C><U+039F><U+039D><U+0391> <U+0395><U+0391><U+03A5><U+03A4><U+039F><U+03A5>, literally meaning "according to his own daim<U+014D>n" and usually interpreted as "true to his own spirit".<ref>Liewer, Steve (November 28, 2008).

He is one of the well known members of the [[27 Club]].

===Estate controversy===
In his [[will (law)|will]], made in [[Los Angeles County]] on February 12, 1969, Morrison (who described himself as "an unmarried person") [[bequest|bequeathed]] his entire estate to Courson, also naming her co-executor with his attorney, Max Fink; she thus inherited everything upon Morrison<U+2019>s death in 1971.

When Courson died in 1974, a battle ensued between Morrison<U+2019>s and Courson<U+2019>s parents over who had legal claim to Morrison<U+2019>s estate. Since Morrison left a will, the question was effectively moot. Upon his death, his property became Courson<U+2019>s, and on her death her property passed to her next heirs at law, her parents. Morrison's parents contested the will under which Courson and now her parents had inherited their son<U+2019>s property.

To bolster their position, Courson<U+2019>s parents presented a document they claimed she had acquired in [[Colorado]], apparently an application for a declaration that she and Morrison had contracted a [[common-law marriage]] under the laws of that state. The ability to contract a common-law marriage was abolished in California in 1896. California's [[conflict of laws]] rules provided for recognition of common-law marriages when lawfully contracted in foreign jurisdictions&nbsp;<U+2014> and Colorado was one of the eleven U.S. jurisdictions that still recognized common-law marriage.

==Artistic roots==
As a naval family the Morrisons relocated frequently. Consequently Morrison's early [[education]] was routinely disrupted as he moved from school to school. Nonetheless he proved to be an intelligent and capable student drawn to the study of [[literature]], [[poetry]], [[religion]], [[philosophy]] and [[psychology]], among other fields.

Biographers have consistently pointed to a number of writers and [[philosophers]] who influenced Morrison's thinking and, perhaps, behavior. While still in his teens Morrison discovered the works of philosopher [[Friedrich Nietzsche]]. He was also drawn to the poetry of [[William Blake]], [[Charles Baudelaire]] and [[Arthur Rimbaud]]. [[Beat Generation]] writers such as [[Jack Kerouac]] also had a strong influence on Morrison's outlook and manner of expression; Morrison was eager to experience the life described in Kerouac's ''[[On the Road]]''. He was similarly drawn to the works of the French writer [[Louis-Ferdinand C<U+00E9>line]]. C<U+00E9>line's book, ''Voyage au Bout de la Nuit'' (''[[Journey to the End of the Night]]'') and Blake's ''[[Auguries of Innocence]]'' both echo through one of Morrison's early songs, "End of the Night". Morrison later met and befriended Michael McClure, a well known beat poet. McClure had enjoyed Morrison's lyrics but was even more impressed by his poetry and encouraged him to further develop his craft.

Morrison's vision of [[performance]] was colored by the works of 20th-century French playwright [[Antonin Artaud]] (author of ''Theater and its Double'') and by [[Julian Beck]]'s [[Living Theater]].

Other works relating to [[religion]], [[mysticism]], ancient [[Mythology|myth]] and [[symbol]]ism were of lasting interest, particularly [[Joseph Campbell]]'s ''[[The Hero with a Thousand Faces]].'' [[James Frazer]]'s ''[[The Golden Bough]]'' also became a source of inspiration and is reflected in the title and lyrics of the song "Not to Touch the Earth".

Morrison was particularly attracted to the myths and religions of Native American cultures.<ref>{{Citation |last= |first= |title=Jim Morrison |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_gx5221/is_2005/ai_n19141572/pg_2 |accessdate=2008-08-24 | work=UXL Newsmakers | year=2005}}</ref> While he was still in school, his family moved to [[New Mexico]] where he got to see some of the places and artifacts important to the Southwest Indigenous cultures. These interests appear to be the source of many references to creatures and places such as lizards, snakes, deserts and "ancient lakes" that appear in his songs and poetry. His interpretation of the practices of a Native American "[[shaman]]" were worked into parts of Morrison's stage routine, notably in his interpretation of the [[Ghost Dance]], and a song on his later poetry album, ''The Ghost Song''.

Jim Morrison's vocal influences were [[Elvis Presley]] and [[Frank Sinatra]], which is evident in his own baritone [[Crooner|crooning]] style used in several of the Doors songs. This is mentioned within the pages of "No One Here Gets Out Alive" by Danny Sugarman, as Jim, as a teenager, who is such a fan of Elvis Presley music that it gets to the point that he demands that people be quiet when Elvis is on the radio. The Frank Sinatra influence is mentioned in the pages of "The Doors, The Illustrated History" also by Sugarman, where Frank Sinatra is listed on Morrison's Band Bio as being his favorite singer. Reference to this can also be found in a [http://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/6027/32782/33583 Rolling Stone article about Jim Morrison], regarding the top 100 rock singers of all time.

==Influence==
Morrison remains one of the most popular and influential singers/writers in rock history as The Doors' catalog has become a staple of [[classic rock]] radio stations. To this day he is widely regarded as the prototypical [[rock music|rock]] star: surly, sexy, scandalous and mysterious. The [[leather]] pants he was fond of wearing both on stage and off have since become stereotyped as rock star apparel.

[[Iggy and the Stooges]] are said to have formed after lead singer [[Iggy Pop]] was inspired by Morrison while attending a Doors concert in [[Ann Arbor, Michigan]].<ref>{{Citation |last= |first= |title=The Stooges: Biography: Rolling Stone |url=http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/thestooges/biography |accessdate=2008-08-24}}</ref> One of Pop's most popular songs, "[[The Passenger (song)|The Passenger]]", is said to be based on one of Morrison's poems.<ref>{{Citation |last=Webb |first=Robert |title=ROCK & POP: STORY OF THE SONG - 'THE PASSENGER' Iggy Pop (1977) |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4158/is_20051014/ai_n15713651 |accessdate=2008-08-24 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080624022402/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4158/is_20051014/ai_n15713651 <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2008-06-24}}</ref> After Morrison's death, Pop was considered as a replacement lead singer for The Doors; the surviving Doors gave him some of Morrison's belongings and hired him as a vocalist for a series of shows.
[[Image:Jim Morrison Memorial Berlin1.JPG|150px|thumb|Jim Morrison Memorial in Germany (Berlin-Baumschulenweg)]]
[[Wallace Fowlie]], professor emeritus of [[French literature]] at [[Duke University]], wrote ''Rimbaud and Jim Morrison,'' subtitled ''"The Rebel as Poet&nbsp;<U+2013> A Memoir".'' In this recounts his surprise at receiving a fan letter from Morrison who, in 1968, thanked him for his latest translation of [[Arthur Rimbaud]]'s verse into English. "I don't read French easily", he wrote, "...your book travels around with me." Fowlie went on to give lectures on numerous campuses comparing the lives, philosophies and poetry of Morrison and Rimbaud.

[[Eddie Vedder]], lead singer of [[Pearl Jam]],<ref>[http://www.zimbio.com/Pearl+Jam/articles/kBPbSW2dnDv/Eddie+Vedder Eddie Vedder - Pearl Jam]. Zimbio. Retrieved on 2010-11-06.</ref> [[Layne Staley]], the late vocalist of [[Alice in Chains]], [[Scott Weiland]], the vocalist of [[Stone Temple Pilots]] and [[Velvet Revolver]], [[Julian Casablancas]] of the [[The Strokes]], as well as [[Scott Stapp]] of [[Creed (band)|Creed]], claimed Morrison to be their biggest influence and inspiration. Stone Temple Pilots and Velvet Revolver have both covered "[[Roadhouse Blues]]" by the Doors. Weiland also filled in for Morrison to perform "Break On Through" with the rest of the Doors. Stapp filled in for Morrison for "Light My Fire", "Riders on the Storm" and "Roadhouse Blues" on ''[[VH1 Storytellers]]''. Creed performed their version of "Riders on the Storm" with Robbie Krieger for the [[Woodstock 1999|1999 Woodstock Festival]].

The book ''The Doors'' by the remaining Doors quotes Morrison's close friend Frank Lisciandro as saying that too many people took a remark of Morrison's that he was interested in revolt, disorder, and chaos <U+201C>to mean that he was an [[anarchy|anarchist]], a revolutionary, or, worse yet, a [[nihilism|nihilist]]. Hardly anyone noticed that Jim was restating Rimbaud and the [[surrealism|Surreal]] poets.<U+201D><ref>The Doors (remaining members Ray Manzarek, Robby Krieger, John Densmore) with Ben Fong-Torres), ''The Doors'', page 104</ref>
