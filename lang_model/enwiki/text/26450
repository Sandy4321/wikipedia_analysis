"'''Today'''" is a song by [[United States|American]] [[alternative rock]] band [[The Smashing Pumpkins]], written by lead vocalist and guitarist [[Billy Corgan]]. The song, though seemingly upbeat, contains dark lyrics. Corgan wrote the song about a day in which he was having [[Suicide|suicidal]] thoughts, exemplified by the reference to self-mutilation in the chorus. However, the contrast between the grim subject matter of the song and the soft instrumental part during the verses, coupled with use of [[irony]] in the lyrics, left many listeners unaware of the song's tale of [[depression]] and desperation. The song alternates between quiet verses and loud choruses with layered, [[Distortion (guitar)|distorted]] guitar.

"Today" was released in September 1993 as the second single from the band's second album and [[major label]] debut, ''[[Siamese Dream]]''. Although Corgan opted for the lead single from the album to be the [[opening track]], "[[Cherub Rock]]", "Today" and its follow-up "[[Disarm]]" are credited in [[All Music Guide]] for popularizing the band and "sen[ding] [''Siamese Dream''] into the stratosphere."<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=11:fifyxqr5ld0e~T1| title=The Smashing Pumpkins Biography| author=Erlewine, Stephen Thomas| coauthors=Prato, Greg| publisher=[[All Music Guide]]| accessdate=2007-04-09}}</ref> "Today" has been generally well-received by critics, and in an article about the song in ''[[Blender (magazine)|Blender]]'' it was described as having "achieved a remarkable status as one of the defining songs of its generation, perfectly mirroring the fractured alienation of American youth in the 1990s."<ref name="blender" />

Drummer [[Jimmy Chamberlin]] was undergoing an increasingly severe [[Drug addiction|addiction]] to [[heroin]]; [[James Iha]] and [[D'arcy Wretzky]] had recently broken up after dating; and [[Billy Corgan]] had become overweight, depressed to the point of contemplating suicide, and suffered from [[writer's block]].<ref name="blender">{{cite web

One day, "out of the blue, I heard the opening lick note for note in my head," Corgan said. "When I added the opening riff, it completely changed the character of the song.

{{sample box end}}

"Today" is written in the [[Musical key|key]] of [[E flat major]] (E<U+266D>) and played in [[standard tuning]]. While Corgan briefly considered simply tuning the guitar down a [[half-step]] and playing the song as if it were in the key of E, he said, "There was something about the E<U+266D> voicing that I liked. So it's absolutely, intentionally in E<U+266D>, not E."<ref name="siamesedream">Aledort, Andrew. "Introduction," in ''Siamese Dream Songbook''. Miami: Warner Bros. Publications, 1994.</ref> "Today" is one of the ''Siamese Dream'' songs on which Corgan took over Iha and D'arcy's duties on guitar and bass to maintain quality; D'arcy later stated that Corgan "can do something in three takes where it would maybe take me 20."<ref name="blender" />

The song, spanning three minutes and 21 seconds, begins with a one-measure opening guitar riff that alludes to the E<U+266D> major-[[pentatonic]] scale.<ref name="siamesedream" /> Corgan uses this riff (along with variations on it) to emphasize certain parts and to indicate shifts in the song.<ref name="geekusa" /> After the riff is played four times, the rest of the band enters backed with feedback-driven guitars.<ref name="amg review">{{cite web

}}</ref> The structure of the song alternates between calm verses reminiscent of [[The Cure]] and louder choruses with guitar playing similar to [[My Bloody Valentine]].<ref name="amg review" /> The chorus, consisting of multiple guitar tracks playing [[barre chords]], is an example of the band's tendency to overdub several rhythm guitar tracks.<ref name="siamesedream" /> While the song does not include a standard guitar solo, a short melodic guitar part appears during the bridge. Corgan explained: "The little guitar break over the C chord is actually a forwards sample that we laid in backwards. Then there's a weird vocal effect that moves across the speakers, a 'yan-yan-yan-yan' thing, which was generated by using a [[Roland RE-201|Roland Space Echo]] to regenerate on the last word of the vocal line, 'I wanna turn you on.'"<ref name="siamesedream" />

The dark, [[irony|ironic]] lyrics of "Today", describing a day when Corgan was feeling depressed and suicidal, contrast with the instrumentation.<ref name="amg review" /> Michael Snyder of the ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'' said that the song is "downright pretty as rock ballads go" but that "Corgan manages to convey the exhilaration and tragic release he seeks."<ref>{{cite web

''The Smashing Pumpkins 1991<U+2013>2000: Greatest Hits Video Collection'' (Virgin Records, 2001).</ref> This image was then melded with Sednaoui's own sensibilities inspired by the film ''[[Zabriskie Point (film)|Zabriskie Point]]''.<ref name="commentary" /> The video is available on ''[[Greatest Hits Video Collection|The Smashing Pumpkins - Greatest Hits Video Collection (1991-2000)]]'' DVD, released in 2001.

The video begins with Corgan reading a [[comic book]] dressed in an ice cream man uniform. A clip of the intro to the song is played and stopped repeatedly before the song begins. Groups of two or more people are kissing each other around Corgan as he drives in an [[ice cream van]] through a desert. Corgan picks up a [[cross-dressing]] Iha and the two drive for a while before stopping at a gas station, where Chamberlin and Wretzky appear as gas attendants. After Iha changes into a yellow and white [[cowboy]] outfit, the band paints the van in a multitude of colors. More people are shown kissing in the hills as the band drives away from the gas station in the van. However, Corgan is ultimately kicked out of the van, and the video ends with Corgan walking off the road wearing a cowboy hat.

==Reception==
"Today" has received generally positive reviews. [[Ned Raggett]] of [[All Music Guide]] called the song an "at-once storming but catchy smash single."<ref name="amg review" /> Johnny Black of ''[[Blender (magazine)|Blender]]'' noted that the song "has achieved a remarkable status as one of the defining songs of its generation."<ref name="blender" /> [[Robert Christgau]] cited "Today" as one of the highlights of ''Siamese Dream''.<ref>{{cite web
