'''''Ladies' Night''''' is the thirteenth studio album by the funk band [[Kool & the Gang]], released in 1979. The album became their first major success especially after the release of the title track, the U.S. #8 "[[Ladies' Night (song)|Ladies' Night]]," and the U.S. #5 follow-up "[[Too Hot (Kool & the Gang song)|Too Hot]]" which both became Billboard Top 10 hits. The album brought a return to the mainstream after a lull in success from 1976-1978. In addition all the cuts from the album reached number five on the disco chart <ref>{{cite book |title= Hot Dance/Disco: 1974-2003|last=Whitburn |first=Joel |authorlink=Joel Whitburn |year=2004 |publisher=Record Research |page=148}}</ref>.

''Ladies' Night'' was the album where Kool & the Gang perfected their funky style and made it more mainstream by incorporating some pop and light R&B into the sound. The result was that this album was not only popular during the 1970s black-oriented [[funk]] era where the band started, but also during the more popular and diverse [[disco]] era. ''Ladies' Night'' became their first Platinum album.<ref>[http://www.discomuseum.com/KoolAndTheGang.html DiscoMuseum] Kool & the Gang page. Accessed: October 1, 2006</ref>
