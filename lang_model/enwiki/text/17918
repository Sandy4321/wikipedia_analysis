[[File:Canadian soldiers talk to afghans.jpg|right|thumb|300px|The Canadian Afghan detainee issue has presented questions about if the government knew and was complicit with torture of Afghan prisoners detained by the Canadian Forces.]]

The '''Canadian Afghan detainee issue''' concerns questions about actions of the executive branch of the [[Government of Canada]] during the [[War in Afghanistan (2001<U+2013>present)|War in Afghanistan]] in regards to Canada transferring [[Afghanistan|Afghan]] detainees to the [[Afghan National Army]] (ANA) or the Afghan [[National Directorate of Security (Afghanistan)|National Directorate of Security]] (NDS). This issue has at least two distinct subcategories:

The first issue concerns whether or not the executive branch of the [[Government of Canada]] knew about alleged abusive treatment of [[Afghanistan|Afghan]] detainees by those Afghan forces. Particularly at issue are questions of ''when'' the government of Canada had this alleged knowledge. [[Timeline of the Canadian Afghan detainee issue|The question of "when"]] is important because it pertains to their responsibility to act on knowledge of mistreatment of detainees. That responsibility is outlined in the [[Third Geneva Convention]], which [[List of parties to the Geneva Conventions|Canada is a party to]].  [[wikisource:Geneva Convention/Third Geneva Convention#Article 12|Article 12]] states that "the Detaining Power [(in this case Canada)] is responsible for the treatment given [to prisoners of war]".

The second issue arose in March 2010, when allegations surfaced that the government did more than turn a blind eye to abuse of Afghan detainees, but that Canada went even further in intentionally handing over prisoners to torturers.<ref name="If">{{Cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/canada/story/2010/03/05/afghan-attaran005.html |title=Canada wanted Afghan prisoners tortured: lawyer |date=5 March 2010 |author=[[CBC News]] |publisher=[[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|CBC]] |accessdate=7 March 2010}}</ref> The allegations were sparked by [[University of Ottawa]] law professor [[Amir Attaran]], who claimed that full versions of government documents proved these claims. If the allegations are true, Canada could be considered guilty of a [[war crime]], according to critics.<ref name="If"/>

Subsequently, the [[Canadian House of Commons]] has been the scene of a showdown, as opposition [[List of House members of the 40th Parliament of Canada|Members of Parliament (MPs)]] have tried to force the government into releasing said documents in full, unredacted form. The controversy over the documents was fueled further when Parliament was [[Prorogation in Canada|prorogued]] at the end of 2009. The government maintained that they had a duty to protect Canadian troops and citizens as the documents contained sensitive information, while opposition MPs have argued they have the [[parliamentary privilege]] to see them. At the request of the [[Speaker of the Canadian House of Commons]], the opposition parties and the government worked together to organize a system to determine what documents were sensitive or not, so that they could be released to MPs. The Canadian public, which generally holds the view that there was knowledge of detainee abuse by military or government officials, now awaits for a clearer picture of the issue as these documents are released.

==Background==
{{CAN-AFG detainee issue}}
Canada's [[War in Afghanistan (2001<U+2013>present)|military involvement in Afghanistan]] began in 2002 with the [[International Security Assistance Force]] (ISAF), a coalition of soldiers from 42 countries, which was tasked as a [[counterinsurgency]] effort in response to the [[September 11 attacks]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.nato.int/cps/en/natolive/topics_48801.htm |title=NATO and the fight against terrorism |publisher=[[NATO]] |accessdate=9 September 2010}}</ref><ref name=ISAF>{{Cite web|url=http://www.nato.int/cps/en/natolive/topics_8189.htm |title=NATO<U+2019>s role in Afghanistan |publisher=[[NATO]] |accessdate=24 May 2010}}</ref> ISAF had initially been established as a stabilization force by the [[United Nations Security Council]] on December 20, 2001, to secure [[Kabul]].<ref name=ISAF /> The Canadian [[Liberal Party of Canada|Liberal]] government at the time, under [[Prime Minister of Canada|Prime Minister]] [[Jean Chr<U+00E9>tien]], chose to have the [[Canadian Forces]] hand over its prisoners to the [[United States]], who led the fight against al-Qaeda and other insurgents.<ref name="CBC InDepth 2007">{{Cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/background/afghanistan/detainees.html |title=In Depth:The controversy over detainees |author=[[CBC News]] |publisher=[[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|CBC]] |date=27 April 2007 |accessdate=30 May 2010}}</ref> After [[NATO]] took command of Afghanistan in 2003, [[Abu Ghraib torture and prisoner abuse]] at the hands of the [[United States armed forces]] in [[Iraq]] came to the attention of the public, and Canada soon faced pressure to hand their prisoners to someone else. Canada entered into an agreement with the [[Afghan government]] and started transferring detainees to Afghan security forces, which comprised the [[Afghan National Army]] (ANA) and the Afghan [[National Directorate of Security]] (NDS).<ref name="CBC InDepth 2007" />

On December 18, 2005, then-[[Chief of the Defence Staff (Canada)|Chief of Defence Staff]] [[Rick Hillier]] signed an agreement between Canada's [[Department of National Defence (Canada)|Department of National Defence]] and the [[Government of Afghanistan]]. The agreement did not include any explicit right of access by Canada to Afghan detainees. Members of the opposition requested then-[[Minister of National Defence (Canada)|Minister of National Defence]] [[Gordon O'Connor]] to renegotiate the prisoner transfer agreement. This request was dismissed, with O'Connor saying the [[Red Cross|International Committee of the Red Cross]] (ICRC) and the [[Red Crescent]] fulfilled the duty of ensuring fair treatment of detainees and Canada could be notified and take action in any cases of abuse.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www2.parl.gc.ca/HousePublications/Publication.aspx?Language=E&Mode=1&Parl=39&Ses=1&DocId=2155910#Int-1498695 |title=House of Commons Debates, Wednesday, April 5, 2006 |publisher=Hansard |date=5 April 2006 |accessdate = 29 April 2010}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www2.parl.gc.ca/HousePublications/Publication.aspx?DocId=2162028&Language=E&Mode=1&Parl=39&Ses=1#Int-1502157 |title=House of Commons Debates, Tuesday, April 11, 2006 |publisher=Hansard |date=11 April 2006 |accessdate = 29 April 2010}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www2.parl.gc.ca/HousePublications/Publication.aspx?Language=E&Mode=1&Parl=39&Ses=1&DocId=2234500#Int-1558417 |title=House of Commons Debates, Wednesday, May 31, 2006 |publisher=Hansard |date=31 May 2006 |accessdate = 29 April 2010}}</ref> However, the Red Cross stated that their mandate was being misunderstood, and it was the responsibility of Canada.<ref name="ICRC contradicts">{{Cite news|url=http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/article746018.ece |first=Paul |last=Koring |title=Red Cross contradicts Ottawa on detainees |publisher=Globe and Mail |date=8 March 2007 |accessdate = 29 April 2010}}</ref> It maintained that it had no role in monitoring the Canada-Afghanistan detainee-transfer agreement, and that following long-established operating procedure, the Red Cross would not reveal to any foreign government any abuses it might find in Afghan prisons.<ref name="ICRC contradicts" /> While maintaining that detainee monitoring was the Red Cross' duty until March 2007, O'Connor apologized to the House of Commons for previously misleading them on the issue.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/canada/story/2007/03/19/afghanaplogy.html |title=O'Connor sorry for misinforming House on Afghan detainees |author=[[CBC News]] |publisher=[[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|CBC]] |date=19 March 2007 |accessdate = 29 April 2010}}</ref> In turn, a new agreement was reached in April 2007 that allowed Canadian officials to have access to [[Kandahar]] jails.<ref name="CBC InDepth 2007" />

==Surfacing of allegations==
The first allegations of detainee abuse came in early February 2007, when [[University of Ottawa]] law professor [[Amir Attaran]] produced documents he had received through an [[Access to Information Act|Access to Information]] request showing that three prisoners in the custody of Canadian military police were brought in by their Afghan interrogator for treatment of similar injuries to the head and upper body, all on the same day. Attaran argued this could be evidence of torture on the part of the interrogator and should be investigated.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/world/story/2007/02/06/military-probe.html |title=Military probes abuse allegations in Afghanistan |author=[[CBC News]] |publisher=[[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|CBC]] |date=6 February 2007 |accessdate = 29 April 2010}}</ref> Attaran has maintained these allegations, stating in 2010 that the documents show torture of detainees was an actual tactic used to obtain information during interrogation.<ref name="Attaran allegations 1">{{Cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/canada/story/2010/03/05/afghan-attaran005.html |title=Canada wanted Afghan prisoners tortured: lawyer |date=March 5, 2010 |author=[[CBC News]] |publisher=[[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|CBC]] |accessdate=7 March 2010}}</ref>

In April 2007, ''[[The Globe and Mail]]'' published interviews with 30 men who claimed they were "beaten, starved, frozen and choked after they were handed over to Afghanistan's National Directorate of Security" by Canadian Forces members.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://v1.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/RTGAM.20070423.wdetainee23/BNStory/Afghanistan |title=From Canadian custody into cruel hands |first=Graeme |last=Smith |publisher=[[The Globe and Mail]] |date=23 April 2007 |accessdate=2007-04-27}}</ref> It also revealed that it had received an censored report by the Canadian government on human rights in Afghanistan through an access to information request, and it contained "negative references to acts such as torture, abuse, and extra judicial killings [that] were blacked out without an explanation."<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://v1.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/RTGAM.20070424.wdetaineereport0425/BNStory/Afghanistan |title=What Ottawa doesn't want you to know |publisher=[[The Globe and Mail]] |first=Paul |last=Koring |date=25 April 2007 |accessdate= 29 April 2010}}</ref> This prompted intensive questioning in the House, to which O'Connor claimed that a new agreement had been reached, saying "we have, in the last few days, entered into a local agreement in the Kandahar province to enter the detention facilities any time we want."<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/canada/story/2007/04/25/afghan-abuse.html |title=Canada will monitor Afghan detainees for signs of torture |author=[[CBC News]] |publisher=[[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|CBC]] |date=25 April 2007 |accessdate=29 April 2010}}</ref> This would be reaffirmed by [[Prime Minister of Canada|Prime Minister]] [[Stephen Harper]], stating that there was "no evidence that access is blocked to the prisons", and that Afghan authorities had agreed to "formalize that agreement so there is no potential misunderstanding."<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.thestar.com/News/article/207670 |title=PM, ministers at odds on Afghan detainees |first=Murray |last=Brewster |publisher=[[Toronto Star]] |date=26 April 2007 |accessdate=29 April 2010}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/article755663.ece |title=PM says Afghan concerns are <U+2018>baseless' |publisher=[[The Globe and Mail]] |first=Tenille |last=Bonoguore |date=26 April 2007 |accessdate=29 April 2010}}</ref> Regardless, [[North Atlantic Treaty Organization|NATO]] Secretary General [[Jaap de Hoop Scheffer]] announced that the Afghan government was to launch an inquiry about the fate of detainees.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.canada.com/topics/entertainment/story.html?id=6c9a55cf-7098-486a-a891-cb33327943f5&k=27119 |title=NATO supports probe into Afghan prisoner abuse allegations |author=[[Canwest News Service]] |publisher=Canada.com |date=29 April 2007 |accessdate=29 April 2010}}</ref> In January 2008, it was revealed that the government ceased the detainee transfers after an internal investigation revealed allegations of a detainee being abused on November 5, 2007.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.thestar.com/news/canada/article/296993 |title=Canada halts transfer of Afghan detainees |last=Woods |first=Allan |date=24 January 2008 |accessdate=29 April 2010 |publisher=[[Toronto Star]]}}</ref>

Allegations regarding the treatment of Afghan detainees resurfaced in November 2009 via parliamentary testimony by [[Richard Colvin (diplomat)|Richard Colvin]], the second highest ranked member of Canada<U+2019>s diplomatic service in Afghanistan from 2006 to 2007.<ref name="Colvin first testimony">{{Cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/canada/story/2009/11/18/diplomat-afghan-detainees.html |title=All Afghan detainees likely tortured: diplomat |author=[[CBC News]] |publisher=[[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|CBC]] |date=18 November 2009 |accessdate=7 March 2010}}</ref> Colvin claimed that many detainees were probably tortured, and it was a [[standard operating procedure]] for Afghan interrogators. This would be consistent with special reports by the [[United Nations Human Rights Commission]] and the [[US Department of State]].<ref name="CBC InDepth 2007" /> Colvin also said the torture involved beatings, whipping with power cables, the use of electricity, knives, open flames and rape.<ref name="Colvin first testimony" /> The Canadian government dismissed opposition calls for a public inquiry the next day. "There has not been a single, solitary proven allegation of abuse involving a transferred Taliban prisoner by Canadian forces", Defence Minister [[Peter MacKay]] said in the House of Commons, with his parliamentary secretary suggesting Colvin was not credible.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/politics/story/2009/11/19/afghanistan-torture-colvin-inquiry.html |title=Tories reject call for Afghan torture inquiry |author=[[CBC News]] |publisher=[[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|CBC]] |date=19 November 2009 |accessdate=7 March 2010}}</ref>

Regardless, Colvin would provide further testimony in a hearing at the Military Police Complaints Commission. He stated that upon visiting Kandahar province's main prison in May 2006, he discovered the ICRC had a "serious problem" with trying to keep track of Afghan prisoners. Officials had approached Colvin with "forceful" concerns about the lack of information given to them by Canada, causing them to lose "many, if not most&nbsp;<U+2014> and possibly all&nbsp;<U+2014> of our detainees," stated Colvin. He has also presented allegations that Canadian government and military officials knew about reports of abuse and human rights violations surrounding [[List of governors of Kandahar|former governor of Kandahar]] [[Asadullah Khalid]], saying Canadian officials heard credible sources claiming that Khalid [[drug lord|ran a drug network]], used drugs himself, used private detention facilities, and [[sexual abuse|sexually abused]] young girls.<ref name="Colvin MPCC 1">{{Cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/canada/story/2010/04/13/mpcc-hearings-colvin.html |title=Colvin: Afghan detainee issue a 'hot potato' |author=[[CBC News]] |publisher=[[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|CBC]] |date=13 April 2010 |accessdate=13 April 2010}}</ref> Colvin is not the only civil servant to indicate there was a problem about Afghan detainees. Eileen Olexiuk, another Canadian diplomat in Afghanistan, also revealed in an interview with the [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|CBC]] that she had warned the government in 2005 about torture problems. She said that the government, which was under the leadership of [[Paul Martin]] at the time, ignored her advice.<ref name="Olexiuk CBC">{{Cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/politics/story/2010/03/09/detainee-afghan-diplomat.html |title=Afghan detainee torture risk raised in 2005 |author=[[CBC News]] |publisher=[[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|CBC]] |date=10 March 2010 |accessdate=10 March 2010}}</ref>

On December 8, 2009, General [[Walter Natynczyk]] testified before a parliamentary committee that one particular detainee that was abused on June 14, 2006 by Afghan police was never in Canadian Forces custody.<ref name="Military Inquiry by General">{{Cite news|url=http://www.nationalpost.com/story.html?id=2999840 |title=Soldier believed but couldn<U+2019>t prove Afghans detainee abuse |publisher=[[National Post]] |date=7 May 2010 |author=Juliet O<U+2019>Neill |accessdate=7 July 2010}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref>  Canada's chief commander stated that although Canadian Forces members had questioned the man, he was taken into custody by Afghan police, and Canadian troops rescued him when the police started beating him with their shoes.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/canada/story/2009/12/08/natynczyk-detainee.html |title=Abused suspect not detained by Canadians: general |author=[[CBC News]] |publisher=[[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|CBC]] |date=8 December 2009 |accessdate=7 July 2010}}</ref> However, the general corrected himself the following day upon receiving new information that the man had in fact been in Canadian custody. This would be the first piece of evidence that Afghan detainees in Canadian custody were subsequently abused by Afghan officials, contrary to government claims that there was no such evidence.

A separate report to General Natynczyk also concluded that the detainee beaten in June 2006 was not defined as a Canadian detainee, preventing it from being reported up the chain of command, and that the Department of Defence and Canadian Forces should <U+201C>be tasked to examine the detainee reporting process...to develop one consolidated process for the reporting on [Canadian Forces] detainees.<U+201D><ref name="Military Inquiry by General" /><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.thestar.com/news/world/article/806255--afghan-officials-regularly-beat-detainees-military-inquiry-finds |author=[[Canadian Press]] |publisher=[[Toronto Star]] |date=7 May 2010 |accessdate=8 July 2010 |title=Afghan officials beat detainees 'on a whim': military inquiry}}</ref>

In March 2010, the ''[[Canadian Press]]'' reported that documents filed with the [[Military Police Complaints Commission]] showed that the [[Canadian Security Intelligence Service]] (CSIS) had starting playing a role in the interrogation of Afghans captured by Canadian Forces in 2006.

While the first specific allegations of abuse surfaced more than three years ago, there has been no official public inquiry. MPs in the House of Commons voted 146 to 129 in favour of a motion to set one up, but the Prime Minister has refused to consider it, stating that "the government of Canada has taken all necessary actions in all instances where there is proof of abuse of Afghan prisoners."<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.nationalpost.com/story.html?id=2293757 |title=Harper rejects Afghan detainee inquiry |author=David Akin |publisher=[[National Post]] |date=1 December 2009 |accessdate=9 September 2010}}</ref> Some critics and the Speaker of the House of Commons have also scolded both the government and opposition MPs for using the issue for political gain.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/opinions/scoring-points-with-detainees/article1550149/?cmpid=rss1 |title=Scoring points with detainees  |author=Margaret Wente |publisher=[[The Globe and Mail]] |date=29 April 2010 |accessdate=7 July 2010}}</ref> Opposition MPs have also stated that it should not be left to the military to investigate itself through the Military Police Complaints Commission.

There are also allegations that the NDS tortured detainees handed over to them by [[United Kingdom|British]] soldiers in Afghanistan. These allegations came as Maya Evans, an anti-war activist, revealed them in a [[London]] courtroom as she sought a judicial review of Britain's detainee transfer policy in Afghanistan. Details of the torture on seven detainees, labelled 'Prisoner A' through 'G', included beatings with sticks, wires, and steel rods, being hung from the ceiling, being put in [[stress positions]], [[sleep deprivation]], and [[electrocution]]. Daniel Carey, who is helping Evans in her bid for a judicial review, also claims there is evidence that [[British Armed Forces]] have received evidence of this torture, and NATO "as buried its head in the sand while torture has continued, and it's known about it."<ref name="UK allegations break">{{Cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/world/story/2010/04/20/britain-detainees.html |title=Afghan torture allegations erupt in U.K. |author=[[CBC News]] |publisher=[[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|CBC]] |date=21 April 2010 |accessdate=22 May 2010}}</ref>

==Dispute over documents and parliamentary committees==
Opposition MPs in the House of Commons have called for all documents the government possess regarding the detainee issue, including reports to the government by Richard Colvin, to be made public. [[Minister of Foreign Affairs (Canada)|Minister of Foreign Affairs]] [[Lawrence Cannon]] assured the House of Commons that the documents would be handed over to a special committee in charge of looking into the issue.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/canada/story/2009/12/01/documents-colvin.html |title=Detainee documents to be handed over: Cannon |date= 2 December 2009 |author=[[CBC News]] |publisher=[[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|CBC]] |accessdate=7 March 2010}}</ref> "There's a mandatory obligation on public officials to ensure that when information is released that it is in compliance with the Canada Evidence Act [to avoid security risks]," according to Minister of Defence Peter MacKay.

Justice Minister [[Rob Nicholson]] announced to the House of Commons on March 5, 2010 that former Supreme Court of Canada judge [[Frank Iacobucci]] was appointed to advise Nicholson if any "injurious" effects would result from making the Afghan detainee documents public. However, [[University of Ottawa]] law professor [[Amir Attaran]] pointed out that Iacobucci was not a sitting judge and therefore had no power except to give lawyer advice to Nicholson.<ref name="If"/><ref>{{Cite video |people=Amir Attaran |title=[http://www.cbc.ca/video/player.html?category=News&zone=canada&site=cbc.news.ca&clipid=1432884136 Prof looks at detainee issue] |medium=Television |publisher=[[CBC News]] |date=5 March 2010}}</ref> The opposition expressed deep disappointment with the decision, saying that they did not doubt the competence of the former justice, but believed that it was nothing more than another way to delay the issue.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/canada/story/2010/03/05/nat-detainee-review.html |title=Ottawa calls for review of detainee documents |date=5 March 2010 |author=[[CBC News]] |publisher=[[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|CBC]] |accessdate=7 March 2010}}</ref> On March 5, 2010, the Parliamentarians were not given a copy of the exact question () that the government posed to [[Frank Iacobucci]].

The government finally released thousands of documents to MPs at the end of March 2010. The documents immediately drew fierce criticism by the opposition, because they were still heavily redacted. Specific criticisms included the "totally incoherent and totally disorderly" fashion of handing them out in a single copy and only in English (instead of both of Canada's official languages), and the fact that the still-existing redactions were merely a way to continue "hiding the truth" and "bide time to protect themselves." The government maintained that redactions are required to protect Canada, with [[Minister of Justice (Canada)|Justice Minister]] [[Rob Nicholson]] stating they were done by "non-partisan public servants whose only interest is the protection of national security."<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/politics/story/2010/03/25/afghan-detainee-documents.html |title=MPs slam Afghan detainee document 'charade' |date=25 March 2010 |author=[[CBC News]] |publisher=[[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|CBC]] |accessdate=13 April 2010}}</ref>

On March 18, the three opposition parties united in a bid to force the government to let them look at uncensored documents on the Afghan detainees affair or face [[Contempt of Parliament|parliamentary contempt proceedings]]. Specifically, they called on the [[Speaker of the Canadian House of Commons]], [[Peter Milliken]] to rule that the government violated [[Parliamentary_privilege#Parliamentary_privilege_in_Canada|collective parliamentary privilege #5]] in refusing to hand over uncensored documents on the transfer of Afghan detainees.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/politics/story/2010/03/18/parliament-afghan-detainee-documents.html |title=Afghan documents debate heats up |date=18 March 2010 |author=[[CBC News]] |publisher=[[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|CBC]] |accessdate=8 April 2010}}</ref> MPs have claimed that the request from Parliament was based on "340 years of bedrock constitutional history",<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.windsorstar.com/news/Opposition+unites+look+uncensored+detainee+documents/2698825/story.html |title=Showdown looms over detainee documents; Tories ignore MPs' motion |author=Juliet O'Neill |date=18 March 2010 |publisher=[[Windsor Star]] |accessdate=30 May 2010}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/politics/opposition-asserts-supremacy-of-parliament-in-afghan-detainee-issue/article1505189/ |title=Opposition asserts supremacy of Parliament in Afghan detainee issue |author=Daniel Leblanc |date=18 March 2010 |publisher=[[Globe and Mail]] |accessdate=20 March 2010}}</ref> and that there are systems in place to decide what is and is not appropriate to release to the public.<ref name="Dosanjh & Harris video" /> Referring to those "systems," Reg Whitaker noted that members of the "Military Police Complaints Commission, whose investigation of the Afghan detainee issue actually led to the calling of the parliamentary inquiry ... are [already] fully security cleared [to see the unredacted documents]."<ref name="Reg Whitaker"/>

The Speaker gave the House until May 11, 2010 to find a common ground, and there was speculation that if a deal was not reached, the government could make it a vote of confidence triggering an election, or ask the [[Supreme Court of Canada]] to hear the case.<ref name="CBC Speaker ruling">{{Cite news|url= http://www.cbc.ca/politics/story/2010/04/27/afghan-detainee-documents-speaker-milliken-privilege-ruling.html |title=Afghan records denial is privilege breach: Speaker |date=27 April 2010 |author=[[CBC News]] |publisher=[[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|CBC]] |accessdate=27 April 2010}}</ref> Both the Prime Minister and [[Leader of the Opposition (Canada)|Opposition leader]] [[Michael Ignatieff]] stated they were willing to work together, but Harper repeated that it must be done in a way to not "break the law [or] order public servants to break the law, nor can it do anything that would unnecessarily jeopardize the safety of Canadian troops."<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/politics/story/2010/04/28/afghan-documents-ruling-ignatieff.html |title=Afghan records release has legal limits: PM |date=28 April 2010 |author=[[CBC News]] |publisher=[[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|CBC]] |accessdate=29 April 2010}}</ref> MPs were cautiously optimistic about a deal in the initial meetings, stating there was "incremental progress," and there is was "emerging consensus" between all parties.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/canada/story/2010/05/03/afghan-documents-talks-speakers-ruling.html |title=Afghan document deal in works |date=3 May 2010 |author=[[CBC News]] |publisher=[[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|CBC]] |accessdate=20 May 2010}}</ref> MPs within the negotiations had to ask The Speaker for an extension of the deadline, as MPs started becoming stalemated on what should and should not remain secret.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/politics/story/2010/05/13/afghan-docs-no-deal.html |title=No deal on Afghan docs as deadline looms |date=13 May 2010 |author=[[CBC News]] |publisher=[[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|CBC]] |accessdate=20 May 2010}}</ref>  An extension until May 14 was granted, and a deal was reached that morning.<ref name="Deal reached">{{Cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/canada/story/2010/05/14/detainee-deal.html |title=Harper pleased with Afghan document deal |date=14 May 2010 |author=[[CBC News]] |publisher=[[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|CBC]] |accessdate=20 May 2010}}</ref> A Memorandum of Understanding on the particulars was not established until June 16, when it was actually tabled in the House of Commons.<ref name="Memo">{{Cite news|url= http://www.cbc.ca/politics/insidepolitics/2010/06/memorandum-of-understanding-on-the-afghan-detainee-documents.html|title=Memorandum of Understanding on the Afghan detainee documents |author=Kerry Wall |date=16 June 2010 |publisher=[[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|CBC]] |accessdate=16 June 2010}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/politics/ottawa-notebook/layton-challenges-absent-pm-to-a-bare-knuckle-round-on-detainees/article1603896/ |title=Layton challenges absent PM to a bare-knuckle round on detainees |author=Jane Taber |date=14 June 2010 |work=Globe and Mail blogs; Ottawa Notebook |publisher=[[Globe and Mail]] |accessdate=16 June 2010}}</ref> It was still not agreed to by all political parties: The [[New Democratic Party]] refused to endorse the deal.<ref name="Memo"/> There is still disagreements over whether the Speaker of the House had made unanimity a requirement, and whether the agreement was good.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.torontosun.com/news/canada/2010/06/14/14389976.html |title= Opposition parties at odds over Afghan detainee document|author= ALTHIA RAJ|date=June 14, 2010 |work= |publisher=[[Toronto Sun]] |accessdate=16 June 2010}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.thestar.com/news/canada/afghanmission/article/824460--travers-afghan-document-deal-hides-the-truth |title=Travers: Afghan document deal hides the truth: Secrecy&nbsp;<U+2013> and Conservatives&nbsp;<U+2013> win on prisoner abuse agreement |author=James Travers |date=June 17, 2010 |work=National Affairs Column |publisher= [[Toronto Star]]|accessdate=16 June 2010}}</ref>

==Public opinion==
An [[EKOS Research Associates|EKOS]] poll conducted in December 2009 revealed that 83% of the respondents believed the government knew Afghan detainees were tortured. This was a consistent result across all age groups, genders and geographic locations. It also concluded that 41% of respondents were dissatisfied with the governments transparency on the issue, and only 24% were satisfied. The remaining 35% were still undecided or had no opinion.<ref name="EKOS poll Canadians dissatisfied">{{Cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/canada/story/2009/12/09/ekos-poll009.html |title=Most Canadians believe Afghan detainees tortured: poll |author=[[CBC News]] |publisher=[[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|CBC]] |date=10 December 2009 |accessdate=14 January 2010}}</ref> As time progressed, 61% of Canadians still believed Afghan detainees were tortured in May 2010, according an [[Ipsos-Reid]] poll.
