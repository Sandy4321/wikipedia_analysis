The '''Budd Rail Diesel Car''' or '''RDC''' is a self-propelled [[Locomotive#Diesel-hydraulic|diesel-hydraulic]] [[rail transport|rail]] [[passenger car]]. During the period of [[1949]]<U+2013>[[1956]], 398 RDCs were built by the [[Budd Company]] of [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]]. These cars were primarily adopted for passenger service in rural areas with low traffic density or in short-haul commuter service, and were less expensive to operate in this context than a traditional [[locomotive]]-drawn train. The cars could be used singly or several coupled together in trainsets and controlled from the cab of the front unit.

The [[Boston and Maine Railroad]] owned by far the largest number of these units, but they were also very popular with the passenger heavy [[New Haven Railroad]] and [[Canada|Canadian]] railways such as the [[Canadian Pacific Railway]] (where they were known as ''Dayliners''), the [[Canadian National Railway]], and the former [[BC Rail]]. [[VIA Rail]] still uses RDCs for scheduled services on [[Vancouver Island]] and in [[Northern Ontario]], and the planned [[Blue22]] service connecting [[Toronto]] to [[Toronto Pearson International Airport|its airport]] will use refurbished RDCs as well.

Since [[1994]] three RDCs are being used for the [[OnTrack]] [[Commuter rail in North America|commuter rail]] line in [[Syracuse, New York]]. As well, the [[Alaska Railroad]] possesses five RDCs (four are in service, and one is used for parts). Three were from SEPTA, two were from the former New Haven Railroad, and one was from Amtrak. [http://www.trainweb.org/rosters/ARR.html] They are typically coupled together and used for the railroad's Hurricane Turn service and the annual Fair Train. The Hurricane Turn is the last remaining flag stop service in the U.S. and is the only transportation to many summer (and year-round) cabins on a stretch of track between [[Talkeetna]] and Hurricane Gulch. (The [[Parks Highway]], the nearest road, is several miles to the west on the other side of a mountain ridge.) The annual Fair Train takes fairgoers from [[Anchorage]] to the [[Palmer, Alaska|Palmer]] stop next to the fairgrounds.

The basic car was adapted from a standard 85&nbsp;[[foot (unit of length)|ft]] (26&nbsp;[[metre|m]]) coach. They were powered by two [[Detroit Diesel]] (then a division of [[General Motors Corporation|General Motors]]) [[diesel]] bus engines, each of which drives an axle through a [[hydraulic]] torque converter, a technology adapted from military tanks of [[World War II]]. RDC trains were an early example of self-contained [[diesel multiple unit]]s, an arrangement now in common use by railways all over the world.

==Variants==

Budd manufactured five basic variants of the RDC:
* The RDC-1 <U+2014> an 85&nbsp;ft (26&nbsp;[[metre|m]]) all-passenger coach seating 88 passengers.
* The RDC-2 <U+2014> an 85&nbsp;ft (26&nbsp;m) [[Railway post office|Railway Post Office]] and passenger coach configuration seating 71 passengers. 
* The RDC-3 <U+2014> an 85&nbsp;ft (26&nbsp;m) variant with a Railway Post Office, a baggage compartment and 44 passenger seats.
* The RDC-4 <U+2014> a 65&nbsp;ft (20&nbsp;m) variant with only the Railway Post Office and baggage area.
* The RDC-5 (also known as the RDC-9) <U+2014> an 85&nbsp;ft (26&nbsp;m) passenger coach seating 82, with no independent control cab.

The RDC-1 was powered by two 6-cylinder [[Detroit Diesel]] engines, each of 275&nbsp;[[horsepower|hp]] (205&nbsp;kW).

Circa 1956, the New Haven had a special RDC train built named "Roger Williams". It consisted of 2-single-ended cab units, and several intermediate cars to make a complete train set. The units even were fitted with third-rail shoes and associated gear for operation into GCT, though this was short lived. In the New Haven's later years, the set was broken up, and used with regular New Haven RDCs, and was used into the 1980s by Amtrak. The two cab units and one intermediate car are fully restored and operational, and can be found at the Danbury Railway Museum in Connecticut.

In [[1978]], Budd offered a new RDC model, called the '''SPV-2000''' (self-propelled vehicle), but only 24 of them were sold, as they proved unreliable and did not gain marketplace acceptance. The few remaining in service have long been converted to unpowered, [[locomotive]]-drawn coaches.

The carriages built by Commonwealth Engineering for the NSWGR had one variation of their own. One car was built with a buffet/snack bar accommodation in one end of the carriage.

===Unusual modifications===
In an experiment toward [[high speed rail]], the [[New York Central]] (NYC) fitted a pair of jet engines atop one of their RDCs and added a shovelnose front to its cab. This RDC, which NYC had numbered M497, set the United States speed record in [[1966]] when it traveled at just short of 184&nbsp;[[miles per hour|mph]] (296&nbsp;[[kilometre per hour|km/h]]) between [[Butler, Indiana]], and [[Stryker, Ohio]].

Several RDCs were built and exported to Australia, to operate with Commonwealth Railways, These cars operated on the standard gauge, running between Port Pirie and various locations, including Whyalla, Port Augusta and Broken Hill.

A variant was built by Commonwealth Engineering for the NSW Government Railways, consisting of five carriages. These cars included the only non-powered version of these carriages. These cars operated the South Coast Daylight Express between Sydney and Nowra.
