'''Horns Bridge''' is a small area on the southeastern edge of [[Chesterfield]], [[Derbyshire]], England which was remarkable at one time for its congested intersection of roads, rivers, footpaths and railways.

==Description==

===Three levels===
Horns Bridge was all the more striking because the congestion was three-dimensional:

''At ground level:''
* the [[River Hipper]]
* the [[River Rother, South Yorkshire|River Rother]]
* the main road to [[Derby]], now the A61
* the main road to [[Mansfield]], now the A617
* the [[Great Central Railway|GCR's]] "Chesterfield Loop", off which ran
* the [[Great Central Railway|GCR's]] "Hyde's Sidings"
* footpaths with associated underbridges and overbridges
''At middle level:''
* the [[Midland Railway|MR's]] Main Line, off which ran
* the [[Midland Railway|MR's]] "Brampton Branch", and
''At high level''
* the [[Lancashire, Derbyshire and East Coast Railway|LD&ECR's]] Main Line to [[Lincoln, England|Lincoln]]

The best place to start to gain an impression of the pre-1960 Horns Bridge is a map. An OS map from the 1940s gives a good idea,<ref>[http://www.npemap.org.uk/tiles/1940s/map.html#438,370,1 Horns Bridge via NPE Maps website]</ref> with a range of other old Black and White maps fleshing out detail.<ref>[http://www.old-maps.co.uk/maps.html?txtXCoord=438721&txtYCoord=370711 Horns Bridge via old-maps website]</ref> Maps are two-dimensional, the aerial photograph in "Gt Central North of Nottingham" gives an idea of scale, complexity and height,{{sfn|Kaye|1991|p= 21}}{{sfn|Booth|2013|p=15}} which "The Changing Face of Chesterfield"{{sfn|Kaye|1985|pp= 1,5,7,23}} and the DVD{{sfn|DVD|2005|loc=20 to 24 mins from start }} complement.

===Gound level=== 
At ''ground level'' both '''rivers''' are prone to flooding, which last happened on a serious scale in 2007. The Horns Bridge area and the inter-war floods are superbly shown in "The Changing Face of Chesterfield."{{sfn|Kaye|1985|p=8}}{{sfn|Kaye|1986|p=20}}

From Chesterfield town centre the Derby and Mansfield '''roads''' separate at Horns Bridge. Nowadays this happens at a large roundabout with several exits. In essence, the A617 Mansfield Road has been upgraded to a dual carriageway running South East to Junction 29 of the M1, incorporating in the process much of the trackbed of the [[Great Central Railway|GCR's]] "Chesterfield Loop." South of Horns Bridge the A61 Derby Road<ref>[http://www.flickr.com/photos/32094439@N03/3034603715/in/photolist-5Ca8XH-dTfdRE-dTfdRm-62782K-dccxBU-dccwxP-ajgfXL-aod14M-dtGNEp-6k5Cj7-23gMbW-fUUKF-2LS24F-8cXoJP-5GL2zR-eGiWQ4-n6ag3-adiSGK-7mJL8q-6ZUxcx-9kuDkp-e2YvHS-4zrAAu-dVxmrm-a2hxYo-7Gb86K-6aDKPo-9wSLDw-drCkoD-drCkRM-aaTc55-9XZdYu-9URzaK-a2h33Q-e8j6qt-9QSVuF-e8j5vr-aKHpuX-dccwrc-dccxgC-93UK5k-cLvUSQ-a2e7Ht-93J2oG-6gm45i-6ynoiu-dQ8GCp-cS9LB3-cS9LK7-aobDRE-dhCsf1 Horns Bridge from Derby Road]</ref> is less changed, it is still a traditional two lane road. North of Horns Bridge, however, it has been dualled and re-routed to follow the alignment of the GCR Chesterfield Loop through the town, including opening out the former GCR tunnel.

Travelling southwards from [[Sheffield Victoria railway station|Sheffield Victoria]], the [[Great Central Railway|GCR's]] double-track '''Chesterfield Loop''' branched West off the [[Great Central Main Line|GCR's Main Line]] at [[Staveley Central railway station|Staveley]] and rejoined it at [[Heath railway station|Heath]]. Its station in Chesterfield was [[Chesterfield Central railway station|Chesterfield Central]], situated North of the Town Centre. The station closed on 5 March 1963. Tracks South of the station to Grassmoor{{sfn|Clemens|2002|loc=39 mins from start}} and Heath{{sfn|Marsden|2004A|loc=40 mins from start}} were lifted in the Winter of 1963/4.

South from Chesterfield Central{{sfn|Clemens|2002|loc=39 & 42 mins from start}}{{sfn|Marsden|2004A|loc=40 mins from start}} the line went immediately into Chesterfield Tunnel, from which it emerged a few hundred yards North of Horns Bridge. It then ran under the Brampton Branch, under a footbridge, under the Midland line, under another footbridge, under the LD&ECR line, over its junction with Hyde's Sidings and finally into open country. This plethora of activity was crammed into a few hundred yards at Horns Bridge.

The first '''footpath''' referred to above ran West to East from the main road. It immediately crossed the Loop Line to the West of the Midland Line using a footbridge known locally as "40 Steps." It then went under the Midland Line. The other footpath ran South to North to the East of the Midland line and crossed the Loop line between the Midland Line and Hyde's sidings.{{sfn|Walker|1973|loc= Plate 63}} Both footbridges were wonderful places for trainspotting, photography{{sfn|Kaye|1988|p= 59}}{{sfn|Marsden|2004B|loc=62 mins from start}}{{sfn|Waller|2004|p=37}} and superb sketches and paintings by Chesterfield artist David Charlesworth.

'''Hyde's Sidings''' were laid by the GCR off the Loop snd served factories to the East of the Midland line at the bottom of Hady Hill. The exit from the sidings onto the loop was protected by a gate, which was a source of mystery to lay observers.{{sfn|Kaye|1985|p= 11}}

===Middle level===
At the ''middle level'' was the first railway into Chesterfield, the '''[[Midland Railway|MR's]] main line''' from [[Sheffield railway station|Sheffield Midland]] to [[St Pancras railway station|London St Pancras]], now widely known as the [[Midland Main Line]]. [[Chesterfield railway station|Chesterfield Midland]] was (and still is) North of the town centre, to the East of Chesterfield Central. At Horns Bridge its four tracks crossed the Mansfield Road immediately East of the junction with Derby Road. The same general layout exists today, though the road junction is now a large roundabout, as described above. The western pair of tracks were used by all passenger trains<ref>[http://www.flickr.com/photos/33650137@N05/5595193541/in/photolist-9wqQ7a-dKpE6c-e7yXhS-bszQRx-c3Q2ro-9GWrvs-btxyFi-bhroMz-9fS1cU-9LhLGt-ehYFS1-e8pGTm-7SjxtG-7j6UHH-8uucwH-dEX7r6-dF3w8d-77ChtM-eyCEJ3-e7z2P3-5gWais-8uxhuG-do8ERz-dMrKvd-aqZQy9-dvGowP-aqZPrJ-dvGnsz-8uxgzC-dMm5mB-dKvjc3-dvMVSJ-9GWsPb-9jivgD-buVpoD-dKpStz-dB6mgD-dZAN8i-dKvpML-aqZTdh-dKvf17-8ogh3t-8uu4Gg-dTUxno-e8e3Ld-a3kych-dv6dRQ-dMrEJ9-4ELRpx-4ELRsZ-ah9CQ8 MR lines approaching Horns Bridge from the south]</ref> and some goods trains. The eastern pair were only used by goods trains. Nowadays some passenger services also use the eastern tracks, so healthy is the level of passenger traffic on the line, which has been chosen for electrification in the next few years. 

The '''MR's Brampton Branch''' turned West off the main line between the Midland station and Horns Bridge. It was single track and never a passenger railway. It was normally worked by an [[LMS Fowler Class 3F|LMS "Jinty" tank]]. A curious survivor is a "bridge to nowhere" '''built''' to serve the Brampton Branch when the major reconstruction of the roads and buildings in the Horns Bridge area took place in the 1980s and 1990s. All trace of the branch West of that bridge has been erased. 

===High level===
At '''high level''' was the most dramatic feature at Horns Bridge - the '''[[Lancashire, Derbyshire and East Coast Railway|LD&ECR's]] main line '''which strode across all the features described above on a major viaduct. This structure consisted of seven brick arches and four girder spans, 63 feet high, flanked by substantial embankments in both directions.{{sfn|Cupit|Taylor|1984|pp= 15,46}}{{sfn|Gilks|2013|p= 206}}{{sfn|Booth|2013|p=16}} The line ran from [[Chesterfield Market Place railway station|Chesterfield Market Place]] to [[Lincoln railway station|Lincoln Central]]. Horns Bridge was reputed to be one of only two places in the world where three railways crossed at one spot at three levels, the other being in the USA. Strictly, the lines didn't cross at ''exactly'' one spot, but that would be to split hairs. Passenger services from Market Place station ended on 3rd Dec 1951, with total closure coming in March 1957. Tracks were lifted but the embankment and viaduct at Horns Bridge remained intact until 1960, when the metal girder spans were removed.{{sfn|Kaye|1985|p= 10}} The brick uprights and arches remained in place like Megaliths{{sfn|Walker|1985|loc= plates 111-4}}{{sfn|Kaye|1991|pp= 8 & 9}}{{sfn|Clemens|2002|loc=39 mins from start}}{{sfn|Marsden|2004A|loc=40 mins from start}}{{sfn|Anderson|2013|p=334}} until 1985 when they and the embankment to the West were swept away for the road alterations mentioned above.

===Today===
Today the only indication that the LD&ECR's massive engineering, land occupancy and buildings ever existed West of Horns Bridge is some blue brickwork beside the Midland Line, shown on an attached photograph. To the East of Horns Bridge the remnants of an embankment and cutting at Spital give some idea of the scale and cost of that undertaking. The GCR's Chesterfield Loop leaves no trace either, though the year stone from the construction of the tunnel has been restored by kindred spirits at the [[Chesterfield Canal]].
