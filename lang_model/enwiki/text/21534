'''Stan Lee''' (born '''Stanley Martin Lieber'''; [[December 28]], [[1922]])<ref name="autobio">Lee, Stan, and Mair, George. ''Excelsior!: The Amazing Life of Stan Lee'' (Fireside, 2002), p.5. ISBN 0-684-87305-2</ref> is an [[United States|American]] [[writer]], [[Editing|editor]], [[Comic book creator|creator of comic book characters]], and the former president and chairman of [[Marvel Comics]]. 

With several artist co-creators, most notably [[Jack Kirby]] and [[Steve Ditko]], he co-created [[Spider-Man]], the [[Fantastic Four]], the [[X-Men]], [[Iron Man]], the [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]], [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]], [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics)|Daredevil]], [[Dr. Strange]], and many other characters, introducing complex, [[Naturalism (literature)|naturalistic]] characters and a thoroughly [[shared universe]] into [[superhero]] [[comic book]]s. He subsequently led the expansion of Marvel Comics from a small division of a [[publishing]] house to a large [[multimedia]] [[corporation]].

==Biography==
===Early life and career===
He was born in [[New York City, New York]], in the apartment of his [[History of the Jews in Romania|Romanian-born Jewish]] [[Immigration|immigrant]] parents, Celia ([[married and maiden names|n<U+00E9>e]] Solomon) and Jack Lieber,<ref>[http://www.filmreference.com/film/93/Stan-Lee.html FilmReference.com: Stan Lee]</ref> at the corner of West 98th Street and West End Avenue in [[Manhattan]].<ref name="autobio" /> His father, trained as a dress cutter, worked only sporadically after the [[Great Depression]], and the family moved further uptown to [[Fort Washington Avenue (Manhattan)|Fort Washington Avenue]],<ref>[http://www.nytimes.com/slideshow/2007/09/04/realestate/keymagazine/20070909STANLEE_2.html Lewine, Edward, "Sketching Out His Past", ''The New York Times Key Magazine'' Slide Show (Sept. 4, 2007), Image 1]</ref> in the Manhattan neighborhood of [[Washington Heights, Manhattan|Washington Heights]]. When Lee was nearly 9,<!--Larry Lieber born Oct. 1931--> his only sibling, brother [[Larry Lieber]], was born. By the time Lee was in his teens, the family was living in a one-bedroom apartment at 1720 University Avenue in [[The Bronx]]<!--note: "The" is part of its proper name, like The Hague-->. Lee described it as "a third-floor apartment facing out back", with him and his brother sharing a bedroom and his parents using a foldout couch.<ref>[http://www.nytimes.com/slideshow/2007/09/04/realestate/keymagazine/20070909STANLEE_3.html Lewine, ''The New York Times'', Image 2]</ref>

Lee attended [[DeWitt Clinton High School]] in The Bronx.<ref>[http://www.stanleeweb.com/stan_bio.htm StanLeeWeb.com: Biography]</ref> where his family had moved next. A voracious reader who enjoyed writing as a teen, he worked such part-time jobs as writing [[Obituary|obituaries]] for a [[News agency|news service]] and [[press releases]] for the National [[Tuberculosis]] Center; delivering sandwiches for the Jack May pharmacy to offices in [[Rockefeller Center]]; working as an office boy for a trouser manufacturer; ushering at the Rivoli Theater on [[Broadway (New York City)|Broadway]]; and selling subscriptions to the ''[[New York Herald Tribune]]'' [[newspaper]]. He graduated high school early, at age 16<U+00BD> in 1939, and joined the [[Works Progress Administration|WPA]] [[Federal Theatre Project]].
[[Image:CaptAmerica3.jpg|thumb|left|A text filler in ''Captain America Comics'' #3 (May 1941) was Lee's first published work. Cover art by [[Alex Schomburg]].]]
With the help of his uncle, Robbie Solomon, [[pulp magazine]] and comic-book [[Publishing|publisher]] [[Martin Goodman (publisher)|Martin Goodman]],<ref>Per Timely Comics' wartime editor [[Vincent Fago]] in [http://www.twomorrows.com/alterego/articles/11fago.html interview, ''Alter Ego'' vol. 3, #11 (Nov. 2001)]</ref> Lee became an assistant at the new [[Timely Comics]] division of Goodman's company. Timely, by the 1960s, would evolve into Marvel Comics. Lee, whose cousin Jean<ref>Lee and Mair, ''Excelsior'', p.22</ref> was Goodman's wife, was formally hired by Timely editor [[Joe Simon]].<ref>Lee's account of how he began working for Marvel's predecessor, Timely, has varied. He has said in lectures and elsewhere that he simply answered a newspaper ad seeking a publishing assistant, not knowing it involved comics, let alone his cousin's husband:
<blockquote>
"I applied for a job in a publishing company ... I didn't even know they published comics. I was fresh out of high school, and I wanted to get into the publishing business, if I could. There was an ad in the paper that said, "Assistant Wanted in a Publishing House." When I found out that they wanted me to assist in comics, I figured, 'Well, I'll stay here for a little while and get some experience, and then I'll get out into the real world.' ... I just wanted to know, 'What do you do in a publishing company?' How do you write? ... How do you publish? I was an assistant. There were two people there named Joe Simon and Jack Kirby <U+2013> Joe was sort-of the editor/artist/writer, and Jack was the artist/writer. Joe was the senior member. They were turning out most of the artwork. Then there was the publisher, Martin Goodman... And that was about the only staff that I was involved with. After a while, Joe Simon and Jack Kirby left. I was about 17 years old [sic], and Martin Goodman said to me, 'Do you think you can hold down the job of editor until I can find a real person?' When you're 17, what do you know? I said, 'Sure! I can do it!' I think he forgot about me, because I stayed there ever since".[http://filmforce.ign.com/articles/035/035881p1.html ''IGN FilmForce'' (June 26, 2000): Stan Lee interview part 1 of 5] 
</blockquote>
However, in his above-cited, 2002 autobiography, ''Excelsior! The Amazing Life of Stan Lee'', he says:
<blockquote>
"My uncle, Robbie Solomon, told me they might be able to use someone at a publishing company where he worked. The idea of being involved in publishing definitely appealed to me. ... So I contacted the man Robbie said did the hiring, Joe Simon, and applied for a job. He took me on and I began working as a gofer for eight dollars a week...."
</blockquote>
[[Joe Simon]], in his 1990 autobiography ''The Comic Book Makers'' (cited under References, below), gives the account slightly differently:
<blockquote>
"One day [Goodman's relative known as] Uncle Robbie came to work with a lanky 17-year-old in tow. 'This is Stanley Lieber, Martin's wife's cousin,' Uncle Robbie said. 'Martin wants you to keep him busy.'"
</blockquote>

In an appendix, however, Simon appears to reconcile the two accounts. He relates a 1989 conversation with Lee:
<blockquote>
Lee: I've been saying this [classified-ad] story for years, but apparently it isn't so. And I can't remember because I['ve] said it so long now that I believe it."<br>
...<br>
Simon: "Your Uncle Robbie brought you into the office one day and he said, 'This is Martin Goodman's wife's nephew.' [sic] ... You were seventeen years old."

Lee: "Sixteen and a half!"

Simon: "Well, Stan, you told me seventeen. You were probably trying to be older.... I did hire you."
</blockquote></ref>

Young Stanley Lieber's first published work, the text filler "[[Captain America]] Foils the Traitor's Revenge" in ''Captain America Comics'' #3 (May 1941), used the pseudonym "Stan Lee", which years later he would adopt as his legal name. Lee later explained in his autobiography and numerous other sources that he had intended to save his given name for more literary work. This initial story also introduced Captain America's trademark ricocheting shield-toss, which immediately became one of the character's signatures.<ref>[[Roy Thomas|Thomas, Roy]], ''Stan Lee's Amazing Marvel Universe'' ([[Sterling Publishing]], New York, 2006), p. 11. ISBN-10 1-4027-4225-8; ISBN-13 978-1-4027-4225-5

The line reads: "With the speed of thought, he sent his shield spinning through the air to the other end of the tent, where it smacked the knife out of Haines' hand!" It became a convention starting the following issue, in a Simon & Kirby's comics story depict the following: "Captain America's speed of thought and action save Bucky's life &mdash; as he hurls his shield across the room".</ref>

He graduated from writing filler to actual comics with a backup feature, "'Headline' Hunter, Foreign Correspondent", two issues later. Lee's first superhero co-creation was the [[Destroyer (Timely Comics)|Destroyer]], in ''[[Mystic Comics]]'' #6 (Aug. 1941). Other characters he created during this period fans and historians call the [[Golden Age of comics]] include [[Jack Frost (Marvel Comics)|Jack Frost]], debuting in ''[[USA Comics]]'' #1 (Aug. 1941), and [[Father Time (Marvel Comics)|Father Time]], debuting in ''Captain America Comics'' #6 (Aug. 1941).<ref>Thomas, ''Stan Lee's Amazing Marvel Universe'', pp. 12-13</ref>

When Simon and his creative partner [[Jack Kirby]] left late in 1941, following a dispute with Goodman,{{fact}} the 30-year-old publisher installed Lee, just under 19 years old, as interim editor. The youngster showed a knack for the business{{fact}} that led him to remain as the comic-book division's editor-in-chief, as well as art director for much of that time, until 1972, when he would succeed Goodman as publisher.

Lee entered the [[United States Army|U.S. Army]] in early 1942 and served stateside in the [[Signal Corps]], writing manuals, training films, and slogans, and occasionally [[Cartoonist|cartooning]]. His military classification, he says, was "playwright"; he adds that only nine men in the U.S. Army were given that title.{{fact}} [[Vincent Fago]], editor of Timely's "animation comics" section, which put out [[humor]] and [[funny animal]] comics, filled in until Lee returned from his [[World War II]] [[conscription|military service]] in 1945. From then through 1947, he and his wife, Joan Clayton Boocock, rented the top floor of a [[brownstone]] in the East 90s in Manhattan.<ref>[http://www.nytimes.com/slideshow/2007/09/04/realestate/keymagazine/20070909STANLEE_2.htm Lewine, ''The New York Times'', Image 3]</ref> They later bought two-story, three-bedroom home at 1084 West Broadway, in [[Woodmere, New York]], on [[Long Island]], living there from 1949 to 1952.<ref>[http://www.nytimes.com/slideshow/2007/09/04/realestate/keymagazine/20070909STANLEE_5.html Lewine, ''The New York Times'', Images 4-5]</ref> The family, which by this time included daughter Joan Celia, bought a home at 226 Richards Lane in the Long Island town of [[Hewlett Harbor, New York]], living there from 1952 to 1980,<ref>[http://www.nytimes.com/slideshow/2007/09/04/realestate/keymagazine/20070909STANLEE_7.html Lewine, ''The New York Times'', Images 6-7]</ref> including the 1960s period when Lee and his artist collaborators would revolutionize comic books.

In the mid-1950s, by which time the company was now generally known as [[Atlas Comics (1950s)|Atlas Comics]], Lee wrote stories in a variety [[genre]]s including [[Romance (genre)|romance]], [[Western fiction|Westerns]], humor, [[science fiction]], [[medieval]] adventure, [[horror (genre)|horror]] and [[suspense]]. By the end of the decade, Lee had become dissatisfied with his career and considered quitting the field.{{fact}}

===Marvel revolution===
In the late [[1950s]], [[DC Comics]] editor [[Julius Schwartz]] revived the superhero genre and experienced a significant success with its updated version of the [[Flash (comics)|Flash]], and later with super-team the [[Justice League|Justice League of America]]. In response, publisher Martin Goodman assigned Lee to create a new superhero team. Lee's wife urged him to experiment with stories he preferred,{{fact}} since he was planning on changing careers and had nothing to lose.

Lee acted on that advice, giving his superheroes a flawed humanity, a change from the ideal archetypes that were typically written for pre-teens. His heroes could have bad tempers, melancholy fits, vanity, greed, etc. They bickered amongst themselves, worried about paying their bills and impressing girlfriends, and even were sometimes physically ill. Before him, most superheroes were idealistically perfect people with no serious, lasting problems: [[Superman]] was so powerful that nobody could harm him, and [[Batman]] was a [[billionaire]] in his secret identity.<ref>Noted  comic-book writer [[Alan Moore]] described the significance of this new approach in [http://www.comicbookresources.com/news/newsitem.cgi?id=4737 ''Comic Book Resources'' (Jan. 27, 2005): "Chain Reaction"]:
"The DC comics were ... one dimensional characters whose only characteristic was they dressed up in costumes and did good. Whereas Stan Lee had this huge breakthrough of ''two-''dimensional characters. So, they dress up in costumes and do good, but they've got a bad heart. Or a bad leg. I actually did think for a long while that having a bad leg was an actual character trait".</ref>

The first superhero group Lee and artist Jack Kirby created was the family of the [[Fantastic Four]]. Its immediate popularity led Lee and Marvel's illustrators to produce a cavalcade of new titles. With Kirby, Lee created the [[Incredible Hulk]], [[Iron Man]], the [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Mighty Thor]] and the [[X-Men]]; with [[Bill Everett]], [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics)|Daredevil]]; and with [[Steve Ditko]], [[Doctor Strange]] and Marvel's most successful character, [[Spider-Man]].

Comics historian Peter Sanderson wrote that in the [[1960s]],
{{cquote|DC was the equivalent of the big [[Hollywood]] studios: After the brilliance of DC's reinvention of the superhero ... in the late 1950s and early 1960s, it had run into a creative drought by the decade's end. There was a new audience for comics now, and it wasn't just the little kids that traditionally had read the books. The Marvel of the 1960s was in its own way the counterpart of the [[French New Wave]].... Marvel was pioneering new methods of comics storytelling and characterization, addressing more serious themes, and in the process keeping and attracting readers in their teens and beyond. Moreover, among this new generation of readers were people who wanted to write or draw comics themselves, within the new style that Marvel had pioneered, and push the creative envelope still further.<ref>Sanderson, Peter. IGN.com (Oct. 10, 2003): [http://comics.ign.com/articles/595/595576p1.html Comics in Context #14: "Continuity/Discontinuity"]</ref>}}

Stan Lee's Marvel revolution extended beyond the characters and storylines to the way in which comic books engaged the readership and built a sense of community between fans and creators.{{fact}} Lee introduced the practice of including a credit panel on the splash page of each story, naming not just the writer and penciller but also the inker and letterer. Regular news about Marvel staff members and upcoming storylines was presented on the [[Bullpen Bulletins]] page, which (like the letter columns that appeared in each title) was written in a friendly, chatty style.

[[Image:AmazingFantasy15.jpg|thumb|''Amazing Fantasy #15'' (1962), the first appearance of Spider-Man. Cover art by Jack Kirby (penciller) & [[Steve Ditko]] (inker).]]

Throughout the 1960s, Lee scripted, art-directed, and edited most of Marvel's series, moderated the letters pages, wrote a monthly column called "Stan's Soapbox", and wrote endless promotional copy, often signing off with his trademark phrase "[[Excelsior|Excelsior!]]" (which is also the [[New York]] state motto). To maintain his taxing workload, yet still meet deadlines, he used a system that was used previously by various comic-book studios, but due to Lee's success with it, became known as the "[[Marvel Method]]" or "Marvel style" of comic-book creation. Typically, Lee would brainstorm a story with the artist and then prepare a brief synopsis rather than a full script. Based on the synopsis, the artist would fill the allotted number of pages by determining and drawing the panel-to-panel storytelling. After the artist turned in penciled pages, Lee would write the [[word balloon]]s and captions, and then oversee the lettering and coloring. In effect, the artists were co-plotters, whose collaborative first drafts Lee built upon.

Because of this system, the exact division of creative credits on Lee's comics has been disputed, especially in cases of comics drawn by Kirby and Ditko. Similarly, Lee shares co-creator credit with Kirby on the two ''Fantastic Four'' films, while also sharing the same credit with Ditko with the ''Spider-Man'' feature film series.

In [[1971]], Lee indirectly reformed the [[Comics Code]]. The US [[Department of Health, Education and Welfare]] asked Lee to write a story about the dangers of drugs and Lee wrote a story in which Spider-Man's best friend becomes addicted to pills. The three-part story was slated to be published in ''Amazing Spider-Man'' #96-98, but the [[Comics Code Authority]] refused it because it depicted drug use; the story context was considered irrelevant.{{fact}} With his publisher's approval, Lee published the comics without the CCA seal. The comics sold well and Marvel won praise for its socially conscious efforts.{{fact}} The CCA subsequently loosened the Code to permit negative depictions of drugs, among other new freedoms.{{fact}}

Lee also supported using comic books to provide some measure of social commentary about the real world, often dealing with [[racism]] and [[bigotry]]. "Stan's Soapbox", besides promoting an upcoming comic book project, also addressed issues of discrimination, intolerance, or prejudice.{{fact}}  In addition, Lee took to using sophisticated [[vocabulary]] for the stories' dialogue to encourage readers to learn new words.  Lee has justified this by saying: "If a kid has to go to a [[dictionary]], that's not the worst thing that could happen."{{fact}}

===Later career===
[[Image:Stan Lee 1973.jpg|thumb|left|Lee at the 1973 [[San Diego Comic Con]].]]
In later years, Lee became a figurehead and public face for Marvel Comics. He made appearances at comic book conventions around America, lecturing at colleges and participating in panel discussions, and by now owning a vacation home on Cutler Lane in [[Remsenburg, New York]]<ref>[http://www.nytimes.com/slideshow/2007/09/04/realestate/keymagazine/20070909STANLEE_9.html Lewine, ''The New York Times'', Image 8]</ref> and, from 1975 to 1980, a two-bedroom [[condominium]] on the 14th floor of 220 East 63rd Street in Manhattan.<ref>[http://www.nytimes.com/slideshow/2007/09/04/realestate/keymagazine/20070909STANLEE_11.html Lewine, ''The New York Times'', Image 10]</ref> He moved to California in 1981 to develop Marvel's TV and movie properties. He has been an executive producer for, and has made [[#Film and television appearances|cameo appearances]] in Marvel film adaptations and other movies. He and his wife bought a home in [[West Hollywood, California]] previously owned by comedian [[Jack Benny]]'s radio announcer, [[Don Wilson]].<ref>[http://www.nytimes.com/slideshow/2007/09/04/realestate/keymagazine/20070909STANLEE_12.html Lewine, ''The New York Times'', Image 11]</ref>  Lee was briefly president of the entire company, but soon stepped down to become publisher instead, finding that being president was too much about numbers and finance and not enough about the creative process he enjoyed.<ref name="autobio" />

Lee also published two novels: ''Dunn's Conundrum'' <ref>([[Harper & Row]], 1985, ISBN 0718125134, ISBN 978-0718125134)</ref> and ''The God Project''.<ref>([[Grove/Atlantic Inc.|Grove/Atlantic]], 1990, ISBN 0802111289, ISBN 978-0802111289)</ref> In ''Dunn's Conundrum'', a group of American [[Cold War]] intelligence specialists called The Librarians are led by Harry Dunn. When the team investigates a leak of U.S. defense information, Dunn begins questioning the entire intelligence system and begins to wonder who the enemy truly is. As the U.S. and the [[Soviet Union]] approach the brink of nuclear war, Dunn must choose whether or not to release sensitive information. In ''The God Project'' presidential aide Malcom Keyes must investigate rumors of the [[CIA]]'s titular secret weapon.

Later in the 1990s, Lee befriended former lawyer [[Peter F. Paul|Peter Paul]], who supervised the negotiation of a non-exclusive contract with [[Marvel Comics]] for the first time in Lee's lifetime employment with Marvel.{{fact}} This enabled Paul and Lee to start a new [[Internet]]-based [[superhero]] creation, production and marketing studio, [[Stan Lee Media]], in 1998. It grew to 165 people and went public, but near the end of 2000, investigators discovered illegal stock manipulation by Paul and corporate officer Stephan Gordon.<ref>SEC Litigation Release No. LR-18828, August 11, 2004.</ref> Stan Lee Media filed for bankruptcy in February 2001, and Paul fled to [[S<U+00E3>o Paulo]], [[Brazil]].<ref name="inside 2001-03-05">"Stan Lee Holder Peter Paul Flees to South America, According to Cohort's Affidavit", ''Inside.com'', March 5, 2001</ref><ref>"Accusations Against Peter Paul Retracted and Corrected in Court Filing", ''MarketWatch.com'', May 7, 2001</ref> He was extradited back to the U.S., and pled guilty to violating [[SEC Rule 10b-5]] in connection with trading of his stock in Stan Lee Media.<ref name="USDOJ 2005-03-08">United States Attorney's Office, [http://www.usdoj.gov/usao/nye/pr/2005mar8.htm "Peter Paul, co-founder of Stan Lee Media, Inc., pleads guilty to securities fraud; Fraud scheme caused $25 million in losses to investors and financial institutions"], press release, [[March 8]], [[2005]].<!--checked--></ref><ref name="Washington Post 2005-10-09">April Witt, [http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/10/04/AR2005100401150.html "House Of Cards: What do Cher, a Hollywood con man, a political rising star and an audacious felon have in common?

W10</ref> Lee was never implicated in the scheme.

Some of the Stan Lee Media projects included the animated Web series ''[[The 7th Portal]]'' where he voiced the character Izayus; ''[[The Drifter]]''; and ''[[The Accuser]]''. The ''7th Portal'' characters were licensed to an interactive [[3-D film|3-D movie]] attraction in four Paramount [[theme parks]].

In the 2000s, Lee did his first work for DC Comics, launching the ''[[Just Imagine...]]'' series, in which Lee reimagined the DC superheroes [[Superman]], [[Batman]], [[Wonder Woman]], [[Green Lantern]] and the [[Flash (comics)|Flash]].

Lee created the risqu<U+00E9> animated superhero series ''[[Stripperella]]'' for [[Spike TV]]. In 2004, he announced plans to collaborate with [[Hugh Hefner]] on a similar superhero cartoon featuring [[Playboy]] Playmates.{{Fact|date=February 2007}} He also announced a superhero program that would feature [[Ringo Starr]], the former [[Beatle]], as the lead character.<ref name="ringo">{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/tv_and_radio/4212335.stm | title=Ringo Starr to become superhero | publisher=[[BBC]] | work=| date=[[2004-08-06]] | author= }}</ref> Additionally, in August of that year, Lee announced the launch of Stan Lee's Sunday Comics,<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.cbc.ca/story/arts/national/2004/08/06/Arts/lee040806.html | title=Stan Lee Launches New Online Comic Venture | publisher=CBC | work=| date=[[2004-08-06]] | author= }}</ref> hosted by [[Komikwerks.com]], where monthly subscribers could read a new, updated comic and "Stan's Soapbox" every Sunday. The column has not been updated since Feb. 15, 2005.

In 2005, Lee, Gill Champion and Arthur Lieberman formed [[POW Entertainment|POW! (Purveyors of Wonder) Entertainment]] to develop film, television and video game properties. The first film produced by POW! was the [[TV movie]] [[Lightspeed (film)|''Lightspeed'']] (also advertised as ''Stan Lee's Lightspeed''), which aired on the [[Sci Fi Channel (United States)|Sci Fi Channel]] on July 26, 2006.{{fact}} <!--This is important material, but Wiki does not consider IMDb a viable primary source.

In 2005, Lee filed a lawsuit against Marvel for his unpaid share of profits from Marvel movies, winning a settlement of more than $10 million.{{fact}}

In 2006, Marvel commemorated Lee's 65 years with the company by publishing a series of one-shot comics starring Lee himself meeting and interacting with many of his creations, including  Spider-Man, Dr. Strange, The Thing, Silver Surfer and Dr. Doom. These comics also featured short pieces by such comics creators as [[Joss Whedon]] and [[Fred Hembeck]], as well as reprints of classic Lee-written adventures.

In 2007, POW! Entertainment started a series of [[direct-to-video|direct-to-DVD]] animated films under the ''Stan Lee Presents'' banner. Each film focuses on a new superhero, created by Stan Lee for the series. The first two releases were ''[[Mosaic (film)|Mosaic]]'' and ''[[The Condor (film)|The Condor]]''.

In June 2007, [[Walt Disney Pictures|Walt Disney Studios]] entered into an exclusive multi-year first look deal with Stan Lee and POW! Entertainment. "It's like the realization of a dream. Ever since I was a young boy, Disney represented the best and most exciting film fare to me. ... I look forward with indescribable enthusiasm to being a part of that world and contributing whatever I can to keep the legend alive and growing," said Lee.<ref>{{cite news | first= | last= | coauthors= | title=Disney Studios Signs Exclusive Deal With Stan Lee | date= | publisher=Magical Mountain | url =http://www.magicalmountain.net/WDWNewsDetail.asp?NewsID=1569 | work = | pages = | accessdate = 2007-06-15 | language = }}</ref>

==Interests==
Lee's favorite authors include [[Stephen King]],  [[H. G. Wells]], [[Mark Twain]], [[Arthur Conan Doyle]], [[William Shakespeare]], [[Charles Dickens]], and [[Harlan Ellison]].<ref>''Stan's Soapbox, Bullpen Bulletins'', October 1998</ref>

==Fictional portrayals==
{{see also|List of comics creators appearing in comics}}
[[Image:FF10.jpg|thumb|240px|''[[The Fantastic Four]]'' #10 (Jan. 1963): Cover art by Kirby & [[Dick Ayers]].]]
Stan Lee and his collaborator [[Jack Kirby]] [[List of comics creators appearing in comics|appear as themselves]] in ''[[The Fantastic Four]]'' #10 (Jan. 1963), the first of several appearances within the fictional [[Marvel Universe]]. The two are depicted as similar to their real-world counterparts, creating comic books based on the "real" adventures of the Fantastic Four. 

Kirby, during his years of working for [[DC Comics]] in the 1970s, created the character [[Funky Flashman]] as a possible parody of Stan Lee. With his hyperbolic speech pattern, gaudy toupee, and hip '70s-Manhattan style beard (as Lee sported at the time) this ne'er-do-well [[Charlatan|charlatan]] first appeared in the pages of ''[[Mister Miracle]]''.

Kirby later portrayed himself, Lee, production executive [[Sol Brodsky]], and Lee's secretary [[Flo Steinberg]] as superheroes in ''[[What If (comics)|What If]] #11'', "What If the Marvel Bullpen Had Become the Fantastic Four?", in which Lee played the part of [[Mister Fantastic]]. Lee has also made numerous cameo appearances in many Marvel titles, appearing in audiences and crowds at many characters' ceremonies and parties, and hosting an old-soldiers reunion in ''[[Nick Fury#Sgt. Fury and his Howling Commandos|Sgt. Fury and his Howling Commandos]]'' #100 (July 1972). Lee appeared, unnamed, as the priest at [[Luke Cage]] and [[Jessica Jones]]' wedding in ''New Avengers Annual'' #1. He pays his respects to [[Karen Page]] at her funeral in the ''[[Daredevil (Marvel Comics)|Daredevil]]'' "Guardian Devil" story arc,{{issue}} and appears in ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' (June 1977).

In [[Alan Moore]]'s satirical miniseries ''[[1963 (comic)|1963]]'', based on numerous Marvel characters of the 1960s, Moore's alter ego "Affable Al" parodies Lee and his allegedly unfair treatment of artists.

The "Young Dan Pussey" stories by [[Daniel Clowes]], collected in ''Pussey!'', feature an exploitative publisher who relies on Lee's gung-ho style and "Bullpen" mythology to motivate his stable of naive and underpaid creators; the stories mainly satirize the state of mainstream comics in the 1990s, but also the subculture of young superhero fans that Lee helped to create.

In Marvel's 1991 comic book adaptation of game ''[[Double Dragon]]'', a character modeled after Stan Lee was specifically created for the comic and is introduced as the father of the protagonists, Billy and Jimmy Lee. The character is only referred by his first name, Stan, although the play on his name is obvious when one considers the Lee brothers' surname.

In ''[[X-Play]]'' on the cable network [[G4 (TV channel)|G4]], the character "Roger, the Stan Lee Experience" - dubbed "the fifth-best-thing next to Stan Lee" - is a foul-mouthed, perverted stand-up comic parody of Lee. Roger's segments normally consist of him describing details of numerous unspeakable adult encounters, usually involving the wife of another Marvel veteran, [[Jack Kirby]], with each encounter somehow leading to the creation of a well-known Marvel character.

In Marvel's July 1997 "Flashback" event, a top-hatted caricature of Lee as a [[ringmaster (circus)|ringmaster]] introduced stories which detailed events in Marvel characters' lives before they became superheroes, in special "-1" editions of many Marvel titles. The "ringmaster" depiction of Lee was originally from ''[[Generation X (comics)|Generation X]]'' #17 (July 1996), where the character narrated a story set primarily in an abandoned circus. Though the story itself was written by [[Scott Lobdell]], the narration by "Ringmaster Stan" was written by Lee himself, and the character was drawn in that issue by [[Chris Bachalo]]. Bachalo's depiction of "Ringmaster Stan" was later used in the heading of a short-lived revival of the "Stan's Soapbox" column, which evolved into a question & answer format.

In his given name of Stanley Lieber, Stan Lee appears briefly in Paul Malmont's 2006 novel "The Chinatown Death Cloud Peril".

Lee and other comics creators are mentioned in [[Michael Chabon]]'s 2000 novel about the comics industry ''[[The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier and Clay]]''.

On one of the last pages of "Truth: Red, White, and Black", Lee appears in a real photograph among other celebrities on a wall of the Bradley home.

In Ultimate X-Men #20, a caricature of Lee appears as a photograph next to the letter Xavier leaves for his students.

In [[Stan Lee Meets Superheroes]], Stan Lee comes in to contact with some of his favorite creations. The series was written by Lee himself.

*Lee narrated the 2000 film ''[[Citizen Toxie: The Toxic Avenger IV]]'', under the pseudonym "Peter Parker."

*One of Lee's earliest contributions to animation based on Marvel properties was narrating the 1980s ''Incredible Hulk'' animated series, always beginning his narration with a self-introduction and ending with "This is Stan Lee saying, ''Excelsior''!"

"Stan Lee never left. I am starting to think his mind is no longer in [[mint condition]].") He asks if [[Comic Book Guy]] is the stalker of [[Lynda Carter]] - the star of the 70s show ''[[Wonder Woman (TV series)|Wonder Woman]]'' - and shows signs of [[dementia]], such as breaking a customer's toy [[Batmobile]] by trying to cram a [[Thing (comics)|The Thing]] [[action figure]] into it (claiming that he "made it better"), hiding [[DC Comics|DC]] comics behind Marvel comics, and believing that he is the [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]] (and fails trying to become the Hulk, while [[Comic Book Guy]] comments he couldn't even change into [[Bill Bixby]]). In a later episode, Lee's picture is seen next to several others on the wall behind the register, under the heading "Banned for life".
