'''Edwin Oswald Ware, Sr.'''  ([[October 29]], [[1853]] -- [[December 6]], [[1933]]), was a [[Baptist]] [[clergy]]man and [[educator]] who is considered to have been the principal founder of [[Louisiana College]] in [[Pineville, Louisiana]] in [[Rapides Parish]]. He was both the college's financial agent, [[1906]]-[[1907]], and its first president, [[1908]]-[[1909]]. Louisiana College marked its 100th year of service on [[October 3]], [[2006]]. A full [[centennial]] ceremony, with former [[U.S. President]] [[George Herbert Walker Bush]] as the principal speaker, was held three weeks later on [[October 26]].

Ware was born in West Berea in [[Powell County, Kentucky|Powell County]], [[Kentucky]]. He was educated in local schools, the [[University of Kentucky]] at [[Lexington, Kentucky|Lexington]], and the [[Southern Baptist Theological Seminary]] in [[Louisville, Kentucky|Louisville]]. He was licensed to the ministry in [[1880]].

He moved to [[Louisiana]] in [[1888]] and lived first in [[Cheneyville, Louisiana|Cheneyville]] (pronounced CHAIN E VILLE) in south Rapides Parish. In [[1890]], he married the former Blanche Fortson of rural Keatchie in [[De Soto Parish]]. The couple had nine children.

Ware pastored Southern Baptist churches in Pineville, [[Alexandria, Louisiana|Alexandria]], [[Lecompte, Louisiana|Lecompte]] (pronounced LEA COUNT), and [[Boyce, Louisiana|Boyce]], all in Rapides Parish. He was executive secretary of the Louisiana Baptist [[Mission (Christian)|Mission]] Board from [[1892]]-1906 and again from [[1910]]-[[1912]]. He was also the mission board's general missionary from [[1919]] until his death. 

He was president of the [[Louisiana Baptist Convention]] in [[1892]], [[1922]], and [[1923]]. He owned and edited the ''Baptist Chronicle'' from [[1912]]-[[1919]]. The paper was the forerunner of the <i>Baptist Message</i>, the long-time state denominational organ. Ware offered a resolution at the Louisiana Baptist Convention in [[1893]] that ultimately resulted in the establishment of Louisiana College. He was the first of the institution's eight (thus far) presidents.

One of Ware's grandsons, Alexandria lawyer [[Ed Ware|Edwin Oswald "Ed" Ware, III]] (born [[1927]]), was the Rapides Parish [[district attorney]] from [[January 1]], [[1973]], until [[December 31]], [[1984]]. A [[Conservatism|conservative]] [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]], Ware, III, was known for undertaking various moral crusades, including legal action against [[obscenity]]. In [[1973]], he tried to ban the [[Marlon Brando]] film ''The Last Tango in Paris'' from being shown in an Alexandria theater.
