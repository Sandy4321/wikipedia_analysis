"'''Deep Throats'''" is the twenty-third episode of season four of the television series ''[[Family Guy]]''. It was written by [[Alex Borstein]] and directed by [[Greg Colton]]. Appalled at parking charges introduced by [[Adam West (Family Guy)|Mayor West]], [[Brian Griffin|Brian]] decides to expose the corruption of the Mayor, despite the prospect of potentially destroying [[Meg Griffin|Meg]]'s new career as the Mayor's intern. Meanwhile, Peter and Lois decide to participate in the Quahog community talent show with a [[folk music|folk singing]] act, as they did in the 1980s, but the couple become largely reliant on [[marijuana]] for inspiration and eventually fail the competition for their poor performance, despite their beliefs they were singing well when under the influence of the drugs.<ref name="BBC">{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b0074gbk|title=Deep Throats|accessdate=2008-04-12|publisher=[[BBC|British Broadcasting Corporation]]}}</ref>

==Plot==
[[Meg Griffin|Meg]] is employed as an intern for [[Adam West (Family Guy)|Mayor West]] after doing an interview with him. The family is impressed by this news, and [[Brian Griffin|Brian]] feels pressured as he is becoming the "new Meg" due to him not having a job. Brian decides to become a [[taxicab driver]], but soon becomes intent on exposing the corruption of Mayor West to the public after receiving a [[United States dollar|$]]400 parking ticket for parking his taxicab on a handicapped zone without permit next to a store where Brian bought some milk for Lois. After discussing his corruption beliefs with Meg, she argues that he is a nice person and that he should drop it. [[Stewie Griffin|Stewie]], after learning of Brian's intentions to expose Mayor West, decides to go with Brian and assist him. After meeting a whistleblower in a parking lot that happens to be [[Kermit the Frog]], Brian discovers where Mayor West will be on the night, and follows him to a motel with Stewie.

They arrive at a motel, they spy on West through the wall, and discover he is involved in a relationship with Meg. Seeing this relationship as an ideal opportunity to take West down, Brian photographs the two together in romantic scenes and recorded their talk in a restaurant, threatening to release them to the press. After Meg finds out about this, she confronts West, who says he and Meg should separate due to the negative media images which will follow if Brian does release the images, because even though he's used to it, he doesn't want Meg's life to be ruined, stating how much he really cares about her. They separate, with Mayor West stating that he will always be there for Meg, and Brian, having secretly heard this, realizes he has made a mistake and Mayor West isn't as bad as he thought, subsequently destroys the images, and later apologizes to Meg. He intends to give her a ride home in his cab, but finds [[Cleveland Brown]] trashing the cab in anger because Brian decided to buy the milk for Lois rather than taking Cleveland to his destination before Brian got the ticket, thinking that Brian didn't pick him up because he was black. 
Earlier, Peter and Brian pass Lois, and Peter rams her car and then shoots the tires. She is furious with Peter, but they manage to laugh and make up afterwards.

Peter and Lois decide to participate in a community [[talent show]] with a [[folk music|folk-singing]] act they always used to do back in the 1980s. They are having a hard time, however, at writing new songs and start to smoke [[Cannabis (drug)|marijuana]], thinking it will provide inspiration. Peter and Lois begin to behave bizarrely in their high state, which greatly disturbs the family. At one point, they even play a guitar, and lie on the sofa naked in front of Brian and Stewie. At the show, they initially appear to wow the entire crowd with their performance, but, when the scene cut to their house, it turns out that they lost. [[Chris Griffin|Chris]], who was in the audience at the show, explains that they were completely oblivious to this fact in their high state and thought they were singing well, when in reality, they blundered horribly. Stewie ends the episode by singing the 'Mr. Belvedere' opening theme angrily as Chris explains the dangers of marijuana to Lois and Peter.

The episode marks the first time in the series that Stewie has expressed an attraction for Brian.<ref name="MacFarlane"/><ref name="Kunis"/> The name of Peter and Lois' band was originally intended to be "[[Fellatio|Mouthful of Peter]]," but broadcasting standards insisted that the show producers change the name to "[[Handjob|Handful of Peter]]."<ref name="Colton"/><ref name="MacFarlane"/> In response to this, MacFarlane comments that "a handjob is more acceptable than a blowjob."<ref name="MacFarlane"/> When performing for the Quahog Talent Competition, one of the lyrics to Peter and Lois' song was scheduled to be "God would do her from behind, even do it a second time," but it was never used.<ref name="Colton"/><ref name="MacFarlane"/> [[Patrick Clark]] organized the format of the credits, which were different from the regular set.<ref name="MacFarlane"/><ref name="Clark">{{cite video | people=Clark, patrick|date=2005|title=Family Guy season 4 DVD commentary for the episode "Deep Throats"| medium=DVD|publisher=20th Century Fox}}</ref>

Peter singing "[[Carol of the Bells]]" was shortened for the televised version of the episode, with an extended version on the DVD.<ref name="MacFarlane"/> [[Cleveland Brown|Cleveland]] sticking his middle finger up to Brian after he fails to stop in his taxi was allowed on the televised version of the episode. This was permitted because MacFarlane rang the shows broadcasting standards and asked for their explicit permission, explaining that it was very distant, and they allowed it.<ref name="MacFarlane"/> After smoking [[Cannabis (drug)|marijuana]], Peter and Lois are shown lying on top of each other on the sofa; in the television version, they are wearing underwear, but are completely naked on the DVD version.<ref name="MacFarlane"/> Similarly, Lois' comment during the scene, "Brian, he's knocking on the back door, what should I do?

==Cultural references==
The episode takes its title from a scene when an anonymous informant (later revealed to be [[Kermit the Frog]]) secretly meets Brian in an underground parking lot. Brian calls the informant "Deep Throat," in a reference to the anonymous informant [[Deep Throat]]. The meeting itself is a reference to the meeting with Deep Throat or to the [[1976 in film|1976]] film ''[[All the President's Men (film)|All the Presidents Men]]''. The part-time job Peter had wherein he sings a song about [[Burger King]] is based on the popular internet meme [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFQyib5ZQZY "Ding Fries are Done,"].   <ref name="Colton"/><ref name="MacFarlane"/> The [[Noid]] attempting to ruin Mayor West's pizza is a reference to the Noid from former [[Domino's Pizza]] television advertisements. The scene where Cleveland runs off as a black panther when he notices Meg and Brian looking at him as he destroys Brian's cab with a crowbar is a reference to [[Michael Jackson]]'s [[Black or White]] 2nd ending known as the Black or White Panther Dance. When Lois mentions to Peter that it would be fun to be in the community talent show, Stewie says "You know what else is fun? Watching [[Mr. Belvedere]] without people talking so loudly!". He then proceeds to sing the theme song loudly.
