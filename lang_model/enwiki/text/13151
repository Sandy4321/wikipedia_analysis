The ride is 5,282 feet long and spans from just behind [[Kings Island#International_Street|International Street]] and the Eiffel Tower and over the [[Kings Island#Rivertown|Rivertown]] area, and into a wooded area.  The roller coaster contains a splashdown element near the end of the ride in the former Swan Lake area in Rivertown, near [[The Beast (roller coaster)|The Beast]]. Construction of this ride restored The Beast's entrance to its original 1979 location.

Diamondback is the biggest investment in Kings Island<U+2019>s 38-year history at $22 million (ahead of [[The Crypt (Kings Island)|The Crypt]] and [[Son of Beast]], each of which cost $20 million). The coaster has a 230-ft lift hill with a 215&nbsp;ft-drop, featuring 10 total drops and a top speed of about 80&nbsp;mph.  This ride is similar to [[Behemoth (roller coaster)|Behemoth]] at [[Canada's Wonderland]] in dimensions and statistics, and like Behemoth has staggered seating.{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}} It opened on April 18, 2009. It is also the park's first ever [[Bolliger and Mabillard]] roller coaster.

==Awards==
Diamondback was ranked 7th best steel roller coaster in its opening year by Amusement Today's Golden Ticket Awards. It was also rated the best new attraction for 2009 by [[NAPHA]].<ref>[http://napha.org/nnn/LATESTINFO/Surveys/tabid/60/Default.aspx NAPHA's 2009 Survey Results]</ref>

==Layout and Ride Experience==
{{Ref improve section|date=June 2009}}
[[File:Diamondback.jpg|left|thumb|250px|Diamondback's lift hill from the exit.]] The coaster starts straight out of the station and up the 230' lift. Once reaching the top of the hill, the coaster descends the 215' drop at 74<U+00B0> over the [[Kings Island#Rivertown|Rivertown]] midway and curves to the right up the second hill and down the drop into the ravine, curving again to the left. The ride then ascends another camelback hill and drops straight into the hammerhead turn. After dropping out of the hammerhead, the train speeds up the fourth hill (which has a [[brake run|trim brake]]) and down into a 287<U+00B0> counter-clockwise helix and into the [[brake run|mid course brake run]]. After the short brake run the train drops down into the ravine, raising into a bunny hop hill, then into another bunny hop and into the final clockwise helix of 323<U+00B0>. After the final helix, the train passes over the [[Kings Island#Rivertown|Rivertown]] midway a second time and drops into the splashdown finale, slowing the train down and leading it into the final brake run. After braking, the train takes a left U-turn and heads back into the station.{{Clear}}

==Splashdown==
[[File:Diamondback-030609-225.jpg|right|thumb|A test train splashes down in Rivertown. Notice the scoops under the last car on the train.]]
Diamondback is one of only five roller coasters around the world to feature a splashdown. Scoops positioned at the sides of the last car on each train send water soaring at heights of 50&nbsp;ft as the train passes. Diamondback is the first sitdown hypercoaster to perform this element. ([[Diving Machine|Dive machines]] [[SheiKra]] and [[Griffon (roller coaster)|Griffon]] at [[Busch Gardens Tampa Bay]] and [[Busch Gardens Williamsburg]] also feature a splashdown.)

==Trains==
The trains on this coaster are the same prototype trains that feature staggered, unobstructed view seating seen on [[Behemoth (roller coaster)|Behemoth]] at [[Canada's Wonderland]] and [[Intimidator (roller coaster)|Intimidator]] at [[Carowinds]]. The front car of each train features a yellow snake head with long fangs, while the inside of the trains are black, red, and orange. There are three trains total, each train featuring a different fin color: green, red, or brown. Under the sides of the last car on each train are the scoops for the splashdown at the end.{{Clear}}

==History==
===Advertising===
A [http://coasterdynamix.com CoasterDynamix] model at Kings Island shows the Diamondback's whole ride in the form of an electric model. There is also a virtual simulation video.
An official press conference was held at 2 p.m. Wednesday, August 6, 2008.  A countdown was displayed on the park's official site with an eye of a creature and a message that said, "OUR MEANEST RIDE HITS THE PARK IN: XX:XX".<ref>

</ref> Also, teaser signs had been posted around the construction site with phrases saying:<br>
"Warning"<br>
''Steep Incline Ahead.''<br>
''Slippery when wet...''<br>
''Move slowly, Do not disturb!!''<br>
''Run for the hills!!!''<br>
''Ride, Sally, ride!!!''<br>
''Easily angered, Do not disturb!!''<br>
''Avoid sudden moves, Do not disturb!!''<br>
''Keep your hands and feet away!!''<br>
''Infrared detectors are in use, Do not disturb!!''<br>
''Extreme danger, Do not disturb!!''<br>
''The park strikes back in 2009''

The countdown clock also featured an [[Easter egg (virtual)|Easter egg]] in the form of a glitch that would cause the timer to incorrectly display the hours at midnight. At midnight the day of the media event, the entire clock began to shake violently, then screaming faces flashed by, followed by a menacing, monster-like eye. The Easter egg was only visible for a brief amount of time.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NoNiMrFcrok |title=YouTube Video of Kings Island Countdown Clock Easter Egg }}</ref>

An official webpage for Diamondback was created at [http://www.kidiamondback.com/ kidiamondback.com] with web cams, a blog, pictures, and video of the ride.

====First Riders====
On February 4, 2009, Kings Island announced they would hold an auction for the first riders on Diamondback. The winners of the auction would be given a commemorative first rider ticket, a special gift from the park, and an admission ticket. All proceeds from the auction would go to A Kid Again non-profit organization, formerly known as Adventures for Wish Kids.<ref>http://www.kidiamondback.com/public/latest/blog/index.cfm?entry=d031ae22-3367-4f21-8f31-fe9174e45c62 kidiamondback.com Blog - Let the bidding begin!</ref> On opening day the first 10,000 riders received a shirt with the ride's logo on it.

===Construction===
Construction of Diamondback began on October 11, 2007, with the removal of a tree.<ref name="a tree">http://kidiamondback.com/public/latest/blog/index.cfm?entry=badd8f9e-684a-46ba-80d0-a4ced97a1822 kidiamondback.com Blog - Did you know?</ref>  Adena Corporation was Diamondback's general contractor during construction.

*'''July 22, 2008''' - The three sections of track are sitting in the former Swan Lake area. One is near the idle Back Porch Stage, while the other two are sitting near the closed Paradise Island food stand. Also near Paradise Island is a new stack of red steel material, which appears to be either wiring conduit or railings. In addition, [[The Crypt (Kings Island)|The Crypt's]] entrance and exit have now been rerouted, and even more concrete footers are being drilled in close proximity to the railroad tracks.<ref>
