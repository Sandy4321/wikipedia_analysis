Also called '''''Ayu''''' by her fans, Hamasaki has been dubbed the "Empress of Pop" due to her popularity and widespread influence in Japan.<ref>{{cite web | first=Lisa | last=Takeuchi Cullen | url=http://www.time.com/time/asia/features/ayumi_hamasaki/ | title=Empress of Pop | publisher=''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' | dateformat=dmy | accessdate=24 January 2008 | pages=Splash}}</ref><ref name="TalkAsia">{{cite web | url=http://www.cnnasiapacific.com/programs/en/program/15/ | title=Talk Asia - Program Descriptions|publisher=[[Turner International|Turner International Asia Pacific]]|dateformat=dmy | accessdate=19 February 2008}}</ref> Born and raised in [[Fukuoka]], she moved to [[Tokyo]] at fourteen to pursue a career in entertainment. In 1998, under the tutelage of [[Avex]] CEO [[Max Matsuura]], she released a string of modestly selling singles that concluded with her 1999 debut album ''[[A Song for XX]]''. The album debuted atop the [[Oricon]] charts and stayed there for four weeks, establishing her popularity in Japan.<ref group=fn name="NFN" />

Because of her constantly changing image and tight control over her artistry, Hamasaki's popularity extends across Asia; music and fashion trends she has started have spread to countries such as [[People's Republic of China|China]], [[Singapore]], and [[Taiwan]]. She has appeared in or lent her songs to many advertisements and television commercials. Though she originally supported the exploitation of her popularity for commercial purposes, she later reconsidered and eventually opposed her status as an Avex "product".<ref name="NTVinterview" />

==Life and music career==
===Childhood and early endeavors===
Born in [[Fukuoka Prefecture]], Hamasaki was raised by her mother and grandmother. Her father had left the family when she was three and never again came into contact with her.<ref name="Rockin">{{ja icon}} {{cite journal | first=Atsushi | last=Shikano | title=Interview with Ayumi Hamasaki| journal=Rockin'on japan| year=2001 | date=February 20, 2001}}</ref><ref name="Time">{{cite web | last=Takeuchi Cullen| first=Lisa| url=http://www.time.com/time/asia/features/ayumi_hamasaki/cover3.html |title=Empress of Pop| publisher= ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]''|dateformat=dmy | accessdate=24 January 2008 | pages=p. 3}}</ref> Because her mother worked to support the family, Hamasaki was primarily taken care of by her grandmother.<ref name="Rockin"/>

At age seven, Hamasaki began modeling for local institutions, such as banks, to supplement the family's income. She continued this career path by leaving her family at fourteen and moving to Tokyo as a model under SOS, a talent agency.<ref name="Rockin"/> Her modeling career did not last long; SOS eventually deemed her too short for a model and transferred her to Sun Music, a musicians' agency. Under the name of "Ayumi", Hamasaki released a rap album, ''[[Nothing from Nothing (album)|Nothing from Nothing]]'', on the [[Nippon Columbia]] label. She was dismissed from the label when the album failed to chart on the Oricon.<ref name="allmusic" /> After this failure, Hamasaki took up acting and starred in [[B-movies]] such as ''Ladys Ladys!! Soucho Saigo no Hi'' and [[Japanese television drama|television dramas]] such as ''Miseinen'', which were poorly received by the public.<ref name="Time"/><ref name="Metropolis"/>  Growing dissatisfied with her job, Hamasaki quit acting and moved in with her mother, who had recently moved to Tokyo.<ref name="Rockin"/>

Hamasaki was initially a good student, earning good grades in [[Education_in_Japan#Junior_high_school|junior high school]].  Eventually, she lost faith in the curriculum, thinking that the subjects taught were of no use to her.  Her grades worsened as she refused to put her mind to her studies. While living in Tokyo, she attempted to further her studies at Horikoshi Gakuen, a [[Education_in_Japan#High_school|high school]] for [[the arts]], but dropped out in the first year.  Because Hamasaki did not attend school or have a job, she spent much of her time shopping at [[Shibuya, Tokyo|Shibuya]] boutiques and dancing at [[Velfarre]], an [[avex trax|Avex]]-owned disco club.<ref name="Rockin"/><ref name="Time"/>

At Velfarre, she was introduced to her future producer, [[Max Matsuura]], through a friend. After hearing Hamasaki sing [[karaoke]], Matsuura offered her a recording deal, but Hamasaki suspected ulterior motives and turned the offer down.<ref name="Time"/> He persisted and succeeded in recruiting her for the Avex label in the following year.<ref name="Time"/><ref>{{cite web | last = Belfiore | first = Michael | url=http://www.musicianguide.com/biographies/1608003868/Ayumi-Hamasaki.html | title=Ayumi Hamasaki Biography | dateformat=dmy| accessdate=June 5 2008| publisher=Musicianguide.com}}</ref> Hamasaki started vocal training, but skipped most of her classes after finding her instructors to be too rigid and the classes dull.<ref name="Time"/> When she confessed this to Matsuura, he sent her to [[New York]] to train her vocals under another method. During her foreign sojourn, Hamasaki frequently corresponded with Matsuura and impressed him with her style of writing.  On her return to Japan, he suggested that she try writing her own lyrics.<ref name="Time"/>

===1998<U+2013>1999: Rising popularity===
Hamasaki's debut album under Avex, ''[[A Song for XX]]'' (1999), was "unassuming":<ref name="VillageVoice" /> its singles were not major hits, and the tracks, composed by Yasuhiko Hoshino, Akio Togashi (of [[Da Pump]]), and Mitsuru Igarashi (of [[Every Little Thing (band)|Every Little Thing]]), were "cautious" [[pop-rock]] songs.<ref name="VillageVoice" /><ref name="Time"/> However, Hamasaki's lyrics, introspective observations about her feelings and experiences that focused on loneliness and individualism, resonated with the Japanese public.<ref name="beatfreak1">{{ja icon}} {{cite journal | title=A Song for XX | journal=Beatfreak | month=January | year=1999 | volume=132}}</ref> The songs gained Hamasaki a growing following, and the release of the album was a success: it topped the Oricon charts for five weeks and sold over a million copies.<ref name="YCTT" /><ref name="allmusic">{{cite web | url=http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=11:wzfwxq9kldke~T1 | title=Ayumi Hamasaki | publisher=[[Allmusicguide]] | dateformat=dmy | accessdate=April 17 2008 | first=Chris | last=True}}</ref><ref name="SCMP">{{cite news | title = Siege Mentality  | page =1 | work =[[South China Morning Post]] | publisher = [[SCMP Group]] | location = Hong Kong, China | date=May 13, 2002 | accessdate=July 14, 2008}}</ref> For her achievements, she earned a [[Japan Gold Disc Award]] for "Best New Artist of the Year".<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.riaj.or.jp/e/data/gdisc/1999.html | title=The 14th Japan Gold Disc Award 1999 | dateformat=dmy | accessdate=April 17 2008 | publisher=[[RIAJ]]}}</ref>

With ''[[Ayu-mi-x]]'' (March 1999), the first of a series of remix albums, Hamasaki began moving beyond the pop-rock of ''A Song for XX'' and began to incorporate different styles including [[trance music|trance]], [[dance music|dance]], and  [[orchestra]].<ref name="VillageVoice">{{cite news | last= Walters| first =Barry  | title =Turning (Japanese) Point   | publisher =''[[The Village Voice]]'' | date =March 5, 2002 | url = http://www.villagevoice.com/music/0209,168697,32804,22.html| accessdate=April 19, 2008}}</ref> Composed by Yasuhiko Hoshino and [[Dai Nagao]] (of [[Do As Infinity]]), the singles released later that year were dance tunes and earned Hamasaki her first number-one single ("[[Love: Destiny (song)|Love: Destiny]]") and first million-selling single ("[[A (song)|A]]").<ref name="fierce" /><ref>{{ja icon}} {{cite web | url=http://www.riaj.or.jp/data/others/million_list/1999.html | title=Million-Selling Singles of 1999 | publisher=[[RIAJ]] | dateformat=dmy | accessdate=April 19 2008}}</ref> Her second studio album, ''[[Loveppears]]'' (November 1999), not only topped the Oricon charts, it sold nearly 3&nbsp;million copies.<ref name="YCTT">{{Cite news| title =You Can't Top This | work = [[The Straits Times]] | publisher = [[Singapore Press Holdings]] |location=Singapore | date =November 25, 1999|agency=[[Reuters]]|accessdate=February 5, 2009}}</ref> The album also showcased a change in Hamasaki's lyrics. Though the lyrics of ''Loveppears'' still dealt with loneliness, many of them were written from a [[Third-person narrative|third-person]] perspective.<ref name="beatfreak1">{{ja icon}} {{cite journal | title=Loveppears | journal=Beatfreak | month=November | year=1999 | volume=142}}</ref> In support of ''Loveppears'', she held her first tour, ''Ayumi Hamasaki Concert Tour 2000 A''.

From April to June 2000, Hamasaki released the "Trilogy", a series of singles consisting of "[[Vogue (Ayumi Hamasaki song)|Vogue]]", "[[Far Away (Ayumi Hamasaki song)|Far Away]]", and "[[Seasons (song)|Seasons]]". The lyrics of these songs focused on hopelessness, a reflection of Hamasaki's disappointment that she had not expressed herself thoroughly in any of her previous lyrics and a sense of shame of her public image.<ref name="Jpoint">{{ja icon}} {{cite journal | title=Review of Ayu's Year 2000 & M| journal=J-Point|date= December 22, 2000| volume=75}}</ref> Likewise, many of the songs she wrote for her subsequent studio album, ''[[Duty (album)|Duty]]'' (September 2000), involved feelings of loneliness, chaos, confusion, and the burden of her responsibilities.

In 2001, Avex forced Hamasaki to release her first compilation album, ''[[A Best]]'', on March 28, putting the album in "competition" with [[Hikaru Utada]]'s second studio album, ''[[Distance (Hikaru Utada album)|Distance]]''. The "competition" between the two singers (which both claimed was merely a creation of their record companies and the media) was supposedly the reason for the success of the albums; both sold over 5 million copies.<ref>{{Cite news| title =J-pop Divas Fight It Out | work = [[The Straits Times]] | publisher = [[Singapore Press Holdings]]| location=Singapore | date =April 20, 2001|agency=[[Reuters]]|accessdate=February 5, 2009}}</ref> In support of ''Duty'' and ''A Best'', Hamasaki held a [[Ayumi Hamasaki Dome Tour 2001 A|tour of Japan's domes]], making her one of few "top-drawer" Japanese artists to hold a concert at the [[Tokyo Dome]].<ref>{{cite news | url=http://english.chosun.com/w21data/html/news/200704/200704190012.html|title=Rain to Perform at Prestigious Tokyo Dome | date=April 19, 2007|accessdate=October 7, 2008|publisher=Chosun Ilbo Co|work=[[Chosun Ilbo]]}}</ref>

''[[I am...]]'' (January 2002) marked several milestones for Hamasaki. Hamasaki increased her control over her music by composing all of the songs on the album under the pseudonym "Crea"; "[[Connected (Ayumi Hamasaki song)|Connected]]" (November 2002) and "[[A Song Is Born (song)|A Song Is Born]]" (December 2001) were the exceptions.<ref name="TimeInterview2">{{cite web | first=Lisa | last=Takeuchi Cullen |url=http://www.time.com/time/asia/features/ayumi_hamasaki/int_ayumi2.html | title=I have very clear ideas of what I want|publisher= ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]''|dateformat=dmy| accessdate=January 2 2008 | pages=p. 2}}</ref> ''I am...'' also showed evolution in Hamasaki's lyrical style: it was a retreat from the themes of "loneliness and confusion" of some of her earlier songs.<ref name="Time5">{{cite web | first=Lisa|last=Takeuchi Cullen|url=http://www.time.com/time/asia/features/ayumi_hamasaki/cover5.html| title=Empress of Pop|publisher= ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]''|dateformat=dmy | accessdate=February 2 2008|pages=p. 5}}</ref> Moved by the [[September 11, 2001 attacks|September 11 attacks]], Hamasaki revised her vision of ''I am...'', focusing on issues such as faith and world peace.

Realizing that English was a "common global language", she used it for the first time on her next studio album, ''[[Rainbow (Ayumi Hamasaki album)|Rainbow]]'' (December 2002).<ref>{{ja icon}} {{cite journal | title=Honey Trap| journal=Cawaii|date=March 1, 2007| volume=8|number=75|author=Tsuriya, Takako|pages=19, 21}}</ref><ref group=fn name="lyrics" /><ref group=fn>Original text from ''Cawaii'': "<U+82F1><U+8A9E><U+3092><U+89E3><U+7981><U+306B><U+3057><U+3088><U+3046><U+3068><U+601D><U+3063><U+305F><U+306E><U+306F><U+3001><U+30A2><U+30EB><U+30D0><U+30E0><U+306E><U+300C>Rainbow<U+300D><U+304B><U+3089><U+306A><U+3093><U+3060><U+3051><U+3069><U+3001><U+3042><U+306E><U+3053><U+308D>MTV<U+306A><U+3069><U+3067><U+8CDE><U+3092><U+3044><U+305F><U+3060><U+3044><U+3066><U+30A2><U+30B8><U+30A2><U+3067><U+30D1><U+30D5><U+30A9><U+30FC><U+30DE><U+30F3><U+30B9><U+3059><U+308B><U+3063><U+3066><U+3044><U+3046><U+3088><U+3046><U+3092><U+3053><U+3068><U+304B><U+4F55><U+56DE><U+304B><U+7D9A><U+3044><U+305F><U+306E><U+3002><U+305D><U+306E><U+3068><U+304D><U+306B><U+3001><U+65E5><U+672C><U+8A9E><U+3060><U+3068><U+3084><U+3063><U+3071><U+3051><U+50B3><U+308C><U+3063><U+3066><U+3092><U+3044><U+304B><U+3082><U+3063><U+3066><U+3044><U+3046><U+6C17><U+304C><U+3057><U+3061><U+3083><U+3063><U+3066><U+3001><U+5358><U+7D14><U+306A><U+5C11><U+5973><U+306F><U+3084><U+3063><U+3071><U+3051><U+4E16><U+754C><U+5171><U+901A><U+8A9E><U+3060><U+3088><U+306A>~<U+3063><U+3067><U+601D><U+3063><U+305F><U+3093><U+3060><U+3088><U+306D><U+3002>"</ref> Though she did not compose as much as on ''I am...''
