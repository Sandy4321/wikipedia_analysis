The '''New York City Police Department Auxiliary Police''' is an unpaid, unarmed reserve police force which is a subdivision of the [[New York City Police Department]]. Auxiliary Police officers assist the Police Department with uniformed patrols and provide traffic and crowd control at vehicular accidents, fires, demonstrations and other major events. Over 4,500 men and women contribute over one million hours of community service each year.

==Ranks==

*There are also numerous positions in the Auxiliary Police that aren't considered ranks, including Field Training Officer(FTO), Executive Officer(XO), and Commanding Officer(CO).

==History==

In 1950, the [[81st United States Congress|81st Congress of the United States of America]] passed the Public Law #920, entitled ''<U+201C>The Civil Defense Act of 1950<U+201D>'' authorizing a [[United States civil defense|Federal Civil Defense Program]]. In 1951, the New York State Legislature enacted the <U+201C>Defense Emergency Act<U+201D> requiring New York City to recruit, train, and equip volunteer Auxiliary Police officers, who would assist the police department in the event of a natural or manmade disaster or other civil defense emergency.

State penal law provided [[peace officer]] status for the Auxiliary Police officers during the event of an actual natural or manmade disaster or attack or during training drills. In 1967, a Mayoral Executive Order closed the Civil Defense Headquarters and placed full responsibility of the Auxiliary Police Program with the NYPD. During the 1960<U+2019>s when crime was on the rise, uniformed Auxiliary Police patrols were an effective means to deter crime.

==Training, Power, and Authority==
[[Image:P4140225.jpg|thumb|right|280px|<center>A NYPD Auxiliary Precinct Patrol RMP.]]
Auxiliary Police recruits must pass a 16-week "Auxiliary Police Basic Training Course" which is classified as "Part Time Peace Officer Training". Auxiliary Recruits are required by the New York State Municipal Police Training Council to undergo and pass this training course before they become Auxiliary Police officers. The training given in this course includes training in penal law, police science, powers of a peace officer, radio use, unarmed self defense, self defense with a [[Club (law enforcement)#Straightstick|straight baton]], first aid, and arrest procedures. In [[2008]], the NYPD revised the training course to include training in domestic violence and terrorism awareness.  A written and physical exam is given at the end of training. Upon the completion of the Basic Training Course, the physical exam, and the written exam, probationary Auxiliary Police officers are issued their shield and police identification card along with their baton and initial uniform allowance voucher. 

All Auxiliary Police officers are required by New York State to pass an annual refresher course in the use of force with the straight baton, arrest procedures, and Equal Employment Opportunity (EEO) in order to maintain their peace officer status.

Auxiliary Police officers are certified as Part-Time [[Peace Officer]]s without Firearms Training by the New York State Division of Criminal Justice Services-Municipal Police Training Council and are registered as peace officers in the NYS DCJS registry of peace officers.

Although volunteers, Auxiliary Police officers are city employees while on duty and may be eligible for Workers' Compensation in the event of injury while on duty.

Auxiliary Police officers who work the minimum required hours per fiscal year receive an annual uniform allowance check to help pay for new and replacement equipment and uniforms.

==Laws==
*Auxiliary Police officers may carry and use [[Club (law enforcement)#Straightstick|straight batons]] under the authority of NYS Penal Law 265.20 b.

*Auxiliary Police officers may carry and use [[handcuff]] restraints both on and off duty in accordance with NYC Administrative Code 10-147 

*Auxiliary Police officers may physically detain violators of Misdemeanors and Felonies under the State of New York Civil Defense Act Article # 8 Section # 105 

*Auxiliary Police officers injured while on duty are provided Workers Compensation under NYC Administrative Code Section 14-147 of chapter 1 of title 14 

*Auxiliary Police officers receive an annual uniform allowance in accordance with the NYC Administrative Code Section 14-148

*Auxiliary Police officers are included in the "fellow officer rule" and may make an arrest for a crime which was not committed in their presence based on information from a dispatcher or police officer heard over a police radio or from a police officer in person. (Authorized by case law: "[http://www.law.cornell.edu/nyctap/I91_0186.htm THE PEOPLE &C., RESPONDENT, v. WILFREDO ROSARIO, APPELLANT])

==Duties==
Auxiliary Police officers duties fall into four broad categories:
# Daily patrol of assigned sectors within their respective precinct, transit district, housing area or specialized unit coverage area.
# Provide additional uniform police presence at parks, playgrounds, pools, street fairs, flea markets, block parties, shopping areas, subway entrances and exits, and school/church crossings.
# Assist with vehicular and pedestrian traffic at parades, marathons, concerts, intersections with broken traffic lights, accident scenes, and fire scenes. 
# Assist in Precinct Identification Programs, Combat Auto Theft Program, Bicycle ID Program, Operation ID Program, Kid Care Program, and VIN Etching Program.
 
[[Image:NYPD White ARMP.jpg|thumb|right|280px|<center>A new NYPD Auxiliary Precinct Patrol RMP.]]
Auxiliary Police officers increase the public's perception of police "[[omnipresence]]" by patrolling in police cars, on foot and on bicycle. The police cars, known as RMPs or [[Radio Motor Patrol]]s, are dark blue or black with white decals or white with light blue decals, in contrast to the RMPs of regular officers, which are white with light blue decals. Auxiliary Police officers wear virtually the same uniform as regular officers, and are equipped with [[Club (law enforcement)#Straightstick|straight batons]], [[Ballistic vest|bullet resistant vests]], [[Walkie-talkie|police radios]] (directly linked to the [[Dispatcher#Public_safety_dispatchers|Central Dispatcher]], other Auxiliary officers, and regular officers), [[flashlight]]s, [[whistles]], [[handcuffs]], and [[High-visibility clothing|reflective traffic vests]]. Their [[badge]] is a seven point star, in contrast to the shield worn by regular officers.<ref>[http://pagesperso-orange.fr/copspassions/NYPD%20Auxiliary%20Officer.jpg Auxiliary Police Badge]</ref>

Auxiliary Police officers in New York City are not permitted to carry a [[side arm]] at any time on duty, even if independently licensed to carry a firearm. In other jurisdictions within New York State, some police departments do allow their Auxiliary Police officers to carry a firearm.

Auxiliary Police officers patrol presence, observations and reporting of incidents requiring regular police response, as well as interacting with the public, are meant to aid in crime reduction and enhance relations between the community and the police.

==Role of the Auxiliary Police Officer == 
Auxiliary Police Officers '''CAN''':
*Assist at accident and fire scenes
*Assist with crowd control
*Assist with police paperwork
*Block off traffic at parades, accidents, fires, etc
*Perform traffic control at broken traffic lights, accidents, etc
*Make arrests when a crime (Felony or Misdemeanor) is committed in their presence
*Make an arrest for a crime which was not committed in their presence based on information from a dispatcher or police officer heard over a police radio or from a police officer in person. (Authorized by case law: "[http://www.law.cornell.edu/nyctap/I91_0186.htm THE PEOPLE &C., RESPONDENT, v. WILFREDO ROSARIO, APPELLANT])" 
*Assist with vehicle or VIP Escorts
*Give medical aid to anyone as long as they are certified and trained to do so
*Carry and use a police [[Club (law enforcement)#Straightstick|baton]] in the performance of their duties (NYS Penal Law 265.20 b.)
*Carry and use handcuff restraints in the performance of their duties (NYC Administrative Code 10-147)

Auxiliary Police Officers '''CANNOT''':
*Make arrests for crimes not committed in their presence unless directed to do so by a regular police officer or a police dispatcher. In 1991 The New York State Court of Appeals "([http://www.law.cornell.edu/nyctap/I91_0186.htm THE PEOPLE &C., RESPONDENT, v. WILFREDO ROSARIO, APPELLANT])" determined that Auxiliary Police officers are covered under the "fellow officer rule" and may detain or arrest a person based on information from a dispatcher or police officer heard over a police radio or from a police officer in person. They are authorized by New York State to make "warrentless" arrests, meaning they have arrest powers beyond that of a private citizen.
*Respond to calls involving any type of weapons or other life endangering conditions.
*Carry a [[firearm]], unless they are regular police officers who are volunteering.
*Make [[traffic stop]]s unless authorized to do so by competent police authority.

== Standard Auxiliary Police Units ==
'''Precinct Patrol:''' Officers patrol their respective precinct. When performing foot patrol, the area of the precinct that the officer patrols is called a Patrol Area, which are divided into "Foot Posts". RMP and Bike Patrol are also performed.

'''Housing Bureau:''' Officers patrol their respective Housing (Police Service Area) precinct, mainly being a uniformed presence within the NYC housing projects. When performing foot patrol, the area of the precinct that the officer patrols is called Patrol Areas, which are divided into "Foot Posts". RMP and Bike Patrol are also performed.

'''Transit Bureau:''' Officers patrol their respective Transit District precinct. When performing foot patrol, the area of the precinct that the officer patrols is called a Patrol Area, which are divided into "Foot Posts". RMP Patrol is also performed.

===Transit Auxiliary Police Officers===
{{main|New York City Transit Police}}
Two weeks after the [[7 July 2005 London bombings|2005 London bombings]], a new directive stated that New York City would institute a citywide transit Auxiliary program with the intent of reducing crime and fighting terrorism in the city's transit system. Transit Auxiliary officers work out of Transit Bureau precincts known as Districts and carry Transit portable radios. Unlike a precinct, the transit districts cover miles of underground subway. Transit Auxiliary Police officers go through additional training by the Transit Bureau Vandals Squad as well as the Counter-Terrorism Division to build vandalism and terrorism awareness within the Transit System. Transit Auxiliary officers are paired with either a regular police officer or Auxiliary police officer. Transit Auxiliary Police periodically perform inspections of the subway station(s) and platforms which they are assigned to, taking note of any suspicious occurrances, and set up a fixed post at the subway turnstiles, token booths, mezzanines, or platforms. Transit Auxiliary officers also conduct subway train inspections as well as train runs to/from stations that which assignment is given. Due to the common medical emergency calls in Transit, if medically qualified, Transit Auxiliary Police officers can respond to medical emergencies if they are near to the transit location. The main function of the NYPD Transit Auxiliary Police, like the NYPD Transit Police, is to primarily remain within the subway system. <ref>[http://www.nycapba.org/ http://www.nycapba.org/](Auxiliary Police Benevolent Association)</ref>

== Specialized Auxiliary Police Units ==
[[Image:Auxsup1.jpg|thumb|right|200px|<center>A NYPD Auxiliary Patrol Support Unit(APSU) patch.]]
[[Image:Image33.jpg|thumb|right|200px|<center>A NYPD Auxiliary Special Task Unit(STU) patch.]]
'''Auxiliary Patrol Support Unit (APSU):''' Auxiliary Police version of the NYPD's [[New York City Police Department#Emergency Service Unit|Emergency Services Unit]] (ESU). Officers wear the same uniform as regular NYPD ESU officers. They assist regular ESU units involving jobs such as dangerous conditions, rescues, vehicle accidents, lockouts, blackouts, blocked roads, natural disasters and other non-tactical calls where ESU is needed. These units carry many specialized tools, generators, lighting and other necessary gear in their vehicles to assist with said jobs. This unit is able to monitor and transmit on both local precinct radio frequencies as well as the SOD (Special Operations Division) citywide frequency. Unlike precinct patrol Auxiliary units, this unit patrols their entire respective patrol borough covering multiple precincts. Officers in this unit are required to go through extra training. '''(As of September 2007, this unit is suspended from patrols for unknown reasons, and it is unknown when and if this unit will be allowed to resume patrols.)'''

'''[[Highway Patrol]]:''' Officers patrol [[highway]]s, parkways, and main thoroughfares throughout the City of New York. Auxiliary Highway Patrol officers wear the same uniform as regular Highway Patrol officers and patrol in regular officers RMP's with '''''AUXILIARY''''' decals on each side, in Auxiliary Police Highway Patrol RMP's, or on motorcycles with '''''AUXILIARY''''' decals on each side. All applicants to this unit are required to have a minimum of five years experience as a patrol officer with the NYPD Auxiliary Police before they will be considered for the job. In addition they must be qualified to operate Highway Patrol vehicles and motorcycles.  ''See article: [[New York City Police Department Highway Patrol]]''

'''Special Task Unit (STU):''' Officers patrol citywide to high crime areas all over the city that need special attention and extra patrol. However, more typical of this unit is traveling to precincts in Queens and Brooklyn during special events such as concerts, marathons, etc. to increase the police presence.  They do not confine themselves to one location or precinct.  

'''[[Water police|Harbor Unit]]:''' Officers patrol New York City's waterways. A marine background such as one obtained through the coast guard, military, or other marine background is required.   

'''Undercover Vice Ops:''' Officers that have not reached the age of 20 years and 6 months old can be utilized to assist the NYPD Vice Unit for "Quality of Life enforcement" stings which address illegal alcohol, knife, and spray paint sales.  Other than this exception, NYPD Auxiliary Police officers are never undercover (*unless authorized by the Police Commissioner or Commanding Officer of the Auxiliary Police) and always patrol in uniform. Officers who have received the necessary "Vice Training" may be used by their Command in non-hazardous surveillance with the supervision of regular police officers.

*The Auxiliary Police also has a Ceremonial Unit made up of a small group of Auxiliary officers.

==Auxiliary Patrol and Police Vehicles==
Patrol is one of the most important duties Auxiliary officers can perform. Various types of patrol's are possible within different precincts. Almost all precincts perform foot patrol. Other types of patrol include:

*RMP (Auxiliary Police Car) - Older cars are painted dark blue or black with white '''''AUXILIARY''''' decals and newer cars are painted white with light blue '''''AUXILIARY''''' decals.
*Van (15 passenger; Used for routine patrol and officer transport) - Older vans are painted dark blue or black with white '''''AUXILIARY''''' decals and newer vans are painted white with light blue '''''AUXILIARY''''' decals.
*Ford Rescue/Equipment (REP) Truck (Used by APSU unit's only; Equipped with rescue tools and other necessary equipment) - Older trucks are painted dark blue and newer ones black instead of standard NYPD white.
*Bicycle 
*Police Golf Cart (Only used in Manhattan's Central Park Precinct)

[[Image:NYPD Auxiliary White RMP.jpg|thumb|right|280px|<center>A new NYPD Auxiliary Precinct Patrol RMP.]]

In most cases, Auxiliary RMPs are retired RMPs that were once used by regular officers. Once the RMP attains a certain amount of mileage on it, it is taken out of service and is either repainted and redecaled and given to a command for the Auxiliary police, or is sold. APSU rescue trucks are retired ESU trucks. However, in [[2008]], the [[NYPD]] has started to phase in brand new police cars for the Auxiliary police. Most commands only have 1 Auxiliary RMP, but some have 2 or even 3. The amount of Auxiliary RMPs per command is based on how many Auxiliary officers are working there and how many extra RMPs the NYPD has available. Commands that have APSU units not only have the Auxiliary RMPs, but also the rescue trucks and the passenger vans. It should also be noted that all Auxiliary vehicles are painted either dark blue or black with white '''''AUXILIARY''''' decals or white with light blue '''''AUXILIARY''''' decals to distinguish themselves from regular officers, who's cars are painted white with light blue decals.

Officers wishing to operate a bicycle, RMP, or van need special training before they are allowed to operate them. Training is done by the Police Academy Driver Training Unit (PADT) which is located at [[Floyd Bennett Field]] in [[Brooklyn]]. The golf cart, which is special to the Central Park Precinct, also requires special training to operate.

== Auxiliary Police Officer Safety ==
[[Image:two highway auxiliary officers.jpg|thumb|right|280px|<center>A pair of Auxiliary Police Officers in the Highway Patrol unit.]]
The NYPD ensures the safety of its Auxiliary Police officers by requiring that they not pursue dangerous situations, but rather to remove themselves from such danger immediately. During training, recruits are repeatedly told that their purpose is to be the "eyes and ears" of the Police Department, and they are not required to enforce the law unless absolutely necessary. Although they are equipped with batons and handcuffs, they are told that their most powerful weapon is the police radio, which allows them to call for back-up officers to the scene. Auxiliary Police officers are not issued, nor are permitted to carry firearms while on duty, even if they are licensed gun owners. 

There is still risk involved in being an Auxiliary officer. On March 14, 2007, two Auxiliary Police officers <U+2014> Eugene Marshalik and Nicholas Pekearo <U+2014> were killed in a shootout in [[Greenwich Village]]. <ref>[http://abclocal.go.com/wabc/story?section=local&id=5123346# Two auxiliary officers killed in Village shootout] (ABC 7)</ref> This was the first time NYPD Auxiliary Police officers were killed in the line of duty since [[1993]].

Up until [[March 26]], [[2007]] the [[NYPD]] did not issue or subsidize ballistic vests to Auxiliary officers. But after the tragic shootings of Auxiliary Police officers Pekearo and Marshalik, [[Mayor]] [[Michael R. Bloomberg]] and Commissioner [[Raymond W. Kelly]] have asked the [[New York City Council]] to earmark more than 3.3 million dollars to provide all Auxiliary Police officers with Level IIIA Vests, the same used by full-time officers. On [[March 27]], [[2007]] the City Council approved this bill, which will have all Auxiliary officers equipped with vests in less than nine months.<ref>[http://www.nydailynews.com/news/crime_file/2007/03/28/2007-03-28_vests_on_way_for_auxiliaries__mike.html  Vests on way for auxiliaries] (Daily News)</ref>

==Representation==
Currently, the 3 largest unions that represent NYPD Auxiliary Police officers are the Auxiliary Police Benevolent Association(APBA)<ref>[http://www.nycapba.org/ Auxiliary Police Benevolent Association]</ref>, Auxiliary Police Supervisors Benevolent Association(APSBA)<ref>[http://www.apsba.org/ Auxiliary Police Supervisors Benevolent Association]</ref>, and the New York State Association of Auxiliary Police(NYSAAP)<ref>[http://www.auxiliary-police.org New York State Association of Auxiliary Police]</ref>

==Line of Duty Deaths==

Since the establishment of the New York City Police Department Auxiliary Police, 7 officers have died in the line of duty. <ref>http://www.odmp.org/agency/2754-new-york-city-police-department---auxiliary-police-section-new-york The Officer Down Memorial Page</ref>

==Off-Duty Incidents Involving Auxiliary Police Officers==
*On [[June 21]], [[2007]], an off-duty Auxiliary Police officer was shot during a dispute at a Queens restaurant. According to police sources, the 25-year-old Auxiliary officer went out for breakfast with a few friends when a man accused a woman with the officer of stealing a cell phone. A dispute ensued and the man shot the Auxiliary officer once in the face. The Auxiliary officer was rushed to the hospital where he was treated and released. So far, no arrests have been made. <ref>[http://www.nydailynews.com/news/crime_file/2007/06/22/2007-06-22_auxiliary_cop_shot_in_face-1.html Auxiliary cop shot in face] (Daily News)</ref>

*On [[July 11]], [[2007]], 2 road-rage suspects attacked an off-duty Auxiliary Police officer. The trouble began at 11:30 a.m. as the off-duty auxiliary officer was driving on Saratoga Avenue at Marion Street in [[Brooklyn]] and swerved to avoid hitting a vehicle being driven by Samuel Soto. After that car cut off the auxiliary officer's truck, Soto tossed a bottle of orange juice at it. After both vehicles pulled over, Soto got out and allegedly punched the Auxiliary officer, who then called police. Soto then yelled for help and Felix Gonzalez approached and allegedly struck the Auxiliary officer. Police arrested both suspects.<ref>[http://www.nypost.com/seven/07122007/news/nypdblotter/nypdblotter.htm Auxiliary officer attacked] (Daily News)</ref>
