The '''Anuradhapura Kingdom''' was the first established [[kingdom]] in ancient [[Sri Lanka]]. Based around its capital, Anuradhapura, the kingdom's sway extended throughout the country, although at times there existed independent regions, particularly towards the end of the kingdom. However, the king of Anuradhapura was regarded as the supreme ruler throughout the island, although he did not have absolute control over it at all times.<ref>Perera (2001), p. 48</ref> Pandukabhaya, the founding ruler of the kingdom, developed the city of Anuradhapura. A change in society and culture occurred when [[Buddhism]] was introduced to the country during the reign of Devanampiya Tissa, which was further strengthened by the arrival of the [[Tooth Relic of the Buddha]] in Sri Lanka and the patronage extended by the rulers.<ref>Perera (2001), p.45</ref> The culture of the Anuradhapura period was based on Buddhism, and even laws and governance of the kingdom were heavily influenced by it.<ref group="N">Buddhism was such an important factor in this period, that Mendis (2000) asserts that "The island of Lanka belonged to the Buddha himself; it was like a treasury filled with the [[Three Jewels|three gems]]".</ref> 

Invasions from South India were a constant threat throughout the Anuradhapura period. Several such invasions have occurred, and rulers such as [[Dutthagamani]], [[Valagamba]] and [[Dhatusena]] are noted for defeating them and regaining control of the kingdom. Other rulers who are notable for military achievements include [[Gajabahu I]], who launched a successful invasion against South India, and [[Sena II]], who sent his armies to assist a [[Pandyan]] prince. The construction of irrigation tanks and canals was an important duty of the monarch, since the economy of the kingdom was based on agriculture. Several kings have built large reservoirs and canals, most notably [[Vasabha]] and [[Mahasena]]. These constructions created a large and intricate irrigation network in the ''Rajarata'' area throughout the Anuradhapura period.

The construction of irrigation works was a major achievement of the Anuradhapura Kingdom and ensured water supply for agricultural needs in the dry zone, thereby making the country mostly self sufficient. These constructions are an indication of the advanced technical and engineering skills used to create them. The famous paintings and structures at [[Sigiriya]] also belong to the Anuradhapura period. Statues of the Buddha made during this period show that sculpting was another art that was well developed in the Anuradhapura Kingdom. Architectural achievements of the Anuradhapura period include the construction of large [[stupas]] such as the [[Ruwanwelisaya]] and [[Jetavanaramaya|Jetavana stupa]], and large buildings like the [[Lovamahapaya]].

==The city of Anuradhapura==
In 543 BC, prince [[Vijaya]] arrived in [[Sri Lanka]], having been banished from his country. He eventually brought the island under his control and established himself as king. After this, his retinue established villages and colonies throughout the country. One of these was established by Anuradha, a minister of King Vijaya, on the banks of a stream called Kolon and named Anuradhagama.<ref>Wijesooriya (2006), p. 20</ref>

Later in 377 BC, King [[Pandukabhaya of Sri Lanka|Pandukabhaya]] made it his capital and developed it into a prosperous city.<ref>Blaze (1995), p. 19</ref><ref>Yogasundaram (2008), p. 41</ref> The city was named [[Anuradhapura]] (Anurapura) after the minister that first established the village and also after a grandfather of Pandukabhaya who dwelt there. The name was also due to the development of the city beginning on the auspicious [[asterism]] called Anura.<ref>Wijesooriya (2006), p. 27</ref> The city of Anuradhapura was the Capital of all the monarchs who ruled the country during in the Anuradhapura Kingdom, with the exception of [[Kashyapa I of Sri Lanka|Kashyapa I]], who chose [[Sigiriya]] to be his capital.<ref>Bandaranayake (2007), p. 6</ref> Anuradhapura is also marked on [[Ptolemy's world map]].<ref>Mendis (1999), p. 7</ref>

==History==
King [[Pandukabhaya of Sri Lanka|Pandukabhaya]], the founder and first ruler of the Anuradhapura Kingdom, fixed village boundaries in the country and established an administration system by appointing village headmen. He constructed houses for the poor, [[hermitage]]s, and [[cemetery|cemeteries]] in addition to starting the construction of [[irrigation tank]]s.<ref>Wijesooriya (2006), p. 28</ref> He brought a large portion of the country under the control of the Anuradhapura Kingdom. However, it was not until the reign of Dutthagamani that the whole country was unified under the Anuradhapura Kingdom.<ref>Siriweera (2004), p. 25</ref> He defeated 32 rulers in different parts of the country before he killed [[Elara]], the South Indian ruler who was occupying Anuradhapura, and ascended to the throne.<ref>Moratuwagama (1996), p. 225</ref> The chronicle ''[[Mahavamsa]]'' describes his reign with much praise, and devotes 11 chapters out of 37 for his reign.<ref>Siriweera (2004), p. 27</ref> He is described as both a warrior king and a devout Buddhist.<ref>Ludowyk (1985), p. 61</ref> After unifying the country, he helped establish Buddhism on a firm and secure base, and built several monasteries and shrines including the [[Ruwanweli Seya]]<ref>Moratuwagama (1996), p. 252</ref> and Lovamahapaya.<ref>Moratuwagama (1996), p. 238</ref>

Another notable king of the Anuradhapura Kingdom is Valagamba (Vatthagamani Abhaya), who was overthrown by five invaders from South India. He regained his throne after defeating these invaders one by one and unified the country again under his rule.<ref>Wijesooriya (2006), p. 75</ref> [[Saddha Tissa]], [[Mahaculi Mahatissa]], [[Vasabha]], [[Gajabahu I]], [[Dhatusena]], [[Aggabodhi I]] and [[Aggabodhi II]] were among the rulers who held sway over the entire country after Dutthagamani and Valagamba. Rulers from [[Kutakanna Tissa]] to [[Amandagamani]] also managed to keep the whole country under the rule of the Anuradhapura Kingdom.<ref name="Siriweera 2004, p. 35">Siriweera (2004), p. 35</ref> Other rulers could not maintain their rule over the whole island, and independent regions often existed in ''Ruhuna'' and ''Malayarata'' (hill country) for limited periods. During the final years of the Anuradhapura Kingdom, rebellions sprang up and the authority of the kings gradually declined.<ref>Siriweera (2004), p. 36</ref> By the time of [[Mahinda V]], the last king of the Anuradhapura Kingdom, the rule of the king had become so weak that he could not even properly organize the collection of taxes.<ref name="Wijesooriya 2006, p. 114">Wijesooriya (2006), p. 114</ref>

During the times of [[Vasabha]], [[Mahasena]] and [[Dhatusena]], the construction of large irrigation tanks and canals was given priority. Vasabha constructed 11 tanks and 12 canals,<ref>Wijesooriya (2006), p. 81</ref> Mahasen constructed 16 tanks and a large canal,<ref>Wijesooriya (2006), p. 88</ref> and Dhatusena built 18 tanks.<ref>Wijesooriya (2006), p. 93</ref> Most of the other kings have also built irrigation tanks throughout ''Rajarata'', the area around Anuradhapura. By the end of the Anuradhapura Kingdom, a large and intricate irrigation network was available throughout Rajarata to support the agriculture of the country.<ref>Siriweera (2004), p. 171</ref>

===Arrival of Buddhism===
One of the most notable events during the Anuradhapura Kingdom was the introduction of [[Buddhism]] to the country. A strong alliance and friendship existed between [[Devanampiya Tissa]] and [[Ashoka]] of India,<ref>Mendis (1999), p. 11</ref> resulting in [[Arahat]] [[Mahinda]], accompanied by four monks and a novice, being sent to Sri Lanka by Ashoka.<ref>Wijesooriya (2006), p. 34</ref> They encountered Devanampiyatissa at [[Mihintale]]. After this meeting, Devanampiya Tissa embraced Buddhism the order of monks was established in the country.<ref>Wijesooriya (2006), p. 38</ref> Devanampiya Tissa, guided by Arahat Mahinda, took steps to firmly establish Buddhism in the country.<ref>Ludowyk (1985), p. 46</ref>

Soon afterwards, the [[bhikkhuni]] [[Sanghamitta]] arrived from India in order to establish the ''[[Bhikkhuni]] sasana'' (order of nuns) in the country.<ref>Ludowyk (1985), p. 49</ref> She brought along with her a sapling from the [[Sri Maha Bodhi]], which was planted in Anuradhapura.<ref>Wijesooriya (2006), p. 41</ref> Devanampiya Tissa bestowed on his kingdom the newly planted [[Jaya Sri Maha Bodhi]].<ref>Ludowyk (1985), p. 55</ref>

===Arrival of the Sacred Tooth Relic===
During the reign of [[Kithsirimevan]], Sudatta, the sub king of [[Kalinga (India)|Kalinga]], and Hemamala brought the [[Tooth Relic of the Buddha]] to Sri Lanka because of unrest in their country.<ref>Blaze (1995), p. 58</ref> Kithsirimevan placed the relic in a mansion called the ''datadhatughara'' and carried it in procession.<ref>Wijesooriya (2006), p. 89</ref> He ordered this procession to be held annually, and this is still done as a tradition in the country. The Tooth Relic of the Buddha was one of the most sacred objects in the country, and it became a symbol of kingship. The person who was in possession of the Tooth Relic would be the rightful ruler of the country.<ref>Blaze (1995), p. 59</ref> Therefore it was often enshrined within the royal palace itself.<ref>Rambukwelle (1993), p. 51</ref>

===Invasions===
Several invasions have been made against the Anuradhapura Kingdom, all of which were launched from [[South India]]. The first invasion recorded in the history of the country is during the reign of [[Suratissa of Sri Lanka|Suratissa]], where he was overthrown by two horse dealers from South India named Sena and Guththika. After ruling the country for 22 years, they were defeated by [[Asela of Sri Lanka|Asela]], who was in turn overthrown by another invasion led by a [[Chola]] prince named [[Elara]].<ref>Wijesooriya (2006), p. 47</ref> Elara ruled for 44 years before being defeated by [[Dutthagamani]].<ref>Wijesooriya (2006), p. 49</ref> However, the Mahavamsa records that these foreign kings ruled the country fairly and lawfully.<ref>Wijesooriya (2006), p. 47</ref>

The country was invaded again in 103 BC by five Dravidian chiefs, [[Pilahattha]], [[Bahiya]], [[Panayamara]], [[Piliyamara]] and [[Dathika]], who ruled until 89 BC when they were defeated by [[Valagamba]]. Another invasion occurred in 433, and the country fell under the control of six rulers from South India. These were [[Pandu]], [[Parinda]], [[Khudda Parinda]], [[Tiritara]], [[Dathiya]] and [[Pithiya]], who were defeated by [[Dhathusena]] who regained power in 459.<ref>Siriweera (2004), p. 42</ref> More invasions and raids from South India occurred during the reigns of [[Sena I]]<ref>Wijesooriya (2006), p. 108</ref> and [[Udaya III]].<ref>Wijesooriya (2006), p. 112</ref> The final invasion during the Anuradhapura Kingdom, which ended the kingdom and left the country under the rule of the Cholas, took place during the reign of [[Mahinda V]].<ref name="Siriweera 2004, p. 44">Siriweera (2004), p. 44</ref> 

However, none of these invaders could extend their rule to ''Ruhuna'', the southern part of the country, and Sri Lankan rulers and their heirs always organized their armies from this area and managed to regain their throne. Throughout the history of Sri Lanka, ''Ruhuna'' served as a base for resistance movements.<ref name="Siriweera 2004, p. 35"/>

===End of the kingdom===
In 993, the Chola Emperor [[Rajaraja I]] invaded Sri Lanka, forcing the then Sri Lankan ruler Mahinda V to flee to the southern part of the country.<ref name="Siriweera 2004, p. 44"/> The Mahavamsa describes the rule of Mahinda V as weak, and the country was suffering from poverty by this time. It further mentions that his army rose against him due to lack of wages.<ref name="Wijesooriya 2006, p. 114"/> Taking advantage of this situation, [[Rajendra I]] son of Rajaraja I, launched a large invasion in 1017. Mahinda V was captured and taken to India, and the Cholas sacked the city of Anuradhapura.<ref name="Siriweera 2004, p. 44"/> They moved the capital to [[Polonnaruwa]] and subsequent Sri Lankan rulers who came into power after the Chola reign continued to use Polonnaruwa as the capital, thus ending the Anuradhapura Kingdom.<ref>Siriweera (2004), p. 45</ref>

==Administration==
The kingdom was under the rule of a king. The consecration ceremonies and rituals associated with kingship began during the reign of Devanampiya Tissa,<ref name="Siriweera 2004, p. 86">Siriweera (2004), p. 86</ref> under the influence of Ashoka of India.<ref>Wijesooriya (2006), p. 30</ref> The whole country was brought under the rule of a single monarch by Dutthagamani for the first time. Before this, it had several principalities independent of the Anuradhapura Kingdom.<ref name="Siriweera 2004, p. 86"/>  The succession of the throne was [[patrilineal]], or if that cannot be the case, inherited by the eldest brother of the previous king. If there were no brothers, his eldest son would inherit the throne.<ref name="Siriweera 2004, p. 87">Siriweera (2004), p. 87</ref>

Four dynasties have ruled the kingdom from its founding to its ending. The rulers from Vijaya to [[Subharaja]] are generally considered as the Vijayan dynasty.<ref group="N">This is also known as the Anuradhapura dynasty, starting from Pandukabhaya.</ref><ref>Nicholas and Paranavitana (1961), p. 54</ref> Pandukabhaya was the first ruler of the Anuradhapura Kingdom belonging to this dynasty. The Vijayan dynasty existed until [[Vasabha]] of the Lambakanna clan seized power in 66. His ascension to the throne saw the start of the first Lambakanna dynasty, which ruled the country for more than 3 centuries.<ref>Nicholas and Paranavitana (1961), p. 77</ref> A new dynasty began with [[Dhatusena]] in 455. Named the Moriya dynasty, the origins of this line are uncertain although some historians trace them to [[Shakya]] princes who accompanied the sapling of the [[Sri Maha Bodhi]] to Sri Lanka.<ref>Nicholas and Paranavitana (1961), p. 123</ref> The last dynasty of the Anuradhapura period, the second Lambakanna dynasty, started with [[Manavamma]] seizing the throne in 684 and continued till the last ruler of Anuradhapura, [[Mahinda V]].<ref>Nicholas and Paranavitana (1961), p. 143</ref>

===Officials and governing===
Royal officials were divided into three categories; officials attached to the palace, officials of central administration and officials of provincial administration. One of the most important positions was the ''purohita'', the advisor of the king.<ref name="Siriweera 2004, p. 87"/> The king also had a board of ministers called ''amati paheja''.<ref>Siriweera (2004), p. 90</ref> In central administration, ''senapati'' (Commander-in-Chief of the Army) was a position second only to the king, and held by a member of nobility.<ref>Siriweera (2004), p. 88</ref> This position, and also the positions of ''yuvaraja'' (sub king), administrative positions in the country's provinces and major ports and provinces, were often held by relatives of the king.<ref name="Siriweera 1994, p. 8">Siriweera (1994), p. 8</ref>

The kingdom was often divided into sections or provinces and governed separately. ''Rajarata'', the area around the capital, was under the direct administration of the king, while the ''Ruhuna'' (southern part of the country) and the ''Malaya Rata'' (hill country) were governed by officials called ''apa'' and ''mapa''. These administrative units were further divided into smaller units called ''rata''. Officials called ''ratiya'' or ''ratika'' were in charge of these.<ref group="N"> This position was called ''rataladda'' by the later period of the Anuradhapura Kingdom.</ref> The smallest administrative unit was the ''gama'' (village), under a village chief known as ''gamika'' or ''gamladda''.<ref>Siriweera (2004), p. 91</ref>

===Buddhist priesthood===
A close link existed between the ruler and the ''[[Sangha]]'' (Buddhist priesthood) since the introduction of Buddhism to the country. This relationship was further strengthened during Dutthagamani's reign. The monks often advised and even guided the king on decisions. This association was initially with the Mahavihara sect, but by the middle of the first century BC, the Abhayagiri sect had also begun to have a close link to the ruling of the country. By the end of the third century AD, the Jetavana sect had also become close to the ruler.<ref>Siriweera (1994), p. 6</ref> Estrangements between the ruler and the priesthood often weakened the government, as happened during the reign of Lanjatissa.<ref>Rambukwelle (1993), p. 45</ref> Even Valagamba's resistance movement was initially hampered because of a rift with the Mahavihara, and he succeeded only after a reconciliation was affected.<ref>Rambukwelle (1993), p. 46</ref> Some rulers patronized only one sect, but this often led to unrest in the country and most rulers equally supported all sects.<ref>Siriweera (1994), p. 7</ref> Despite this, religious establishments were often plundered during times of internal strife by the rulers themselves, such as during the reign of [[Dathopatissa]] and [[Kashyapa II]].<ref name="Siriweera 1994, p. 8"/>

===Law===
Customs, traditions and moral principles based on Buddhism were used as the bases of law. Specific laws were eventually developed and adopted. ''Samantapasadika'', a fifth century commentary, gives details of complex regulations on the theft of fish. The chief judicial officer was known as ''viniccayamacca'' and there were several judicial officers under him, known as ''vinicchayaka''. Apart from them, village headmen and provincial governors were also given the power to issue judgments. The king was the final judge in legal disputes, and all cases against members of the royal family and high dignitaries of the state were judged by him. However, the king had to exercise this power with care and after consulting with his advisers.<ref>Siriweera (2004), p. 92</ref> Udaya I recorded judgments that were regarded as important precedents in the royal library in order to maintain uniformity in judicial decisions.<ref>Mendis (1999), p. 144</ref>

Initially, the administration of justice at village level was the responsibility of village assemblies, which usually consisted of the elders of the village.<ref name="Rambukwelle 1993, p. 38">Rambukwelle (1993), p. 38</ref> However, towards the end of the Anuradhapura Kingdom a group of ten villages, known as ''dasagam'', was responsible for upholding justice in that area. The laws and legal measures to be followed by them were proclaimed by the king. Several rock inscriptions that record these proclamations have been found in archaeological excavations. Punishments differed from ruler to ruler. Some kings, such as [[Sanghabodhi]] and [[Voharika Tissa]] were lenient in this aspect, while rulers like [[Ilanaga]] and [[Jetthatissa]] were harsher. However, crimes such as treason, murder and slaughter of cattle were generally punishable by death.<ref>Siriweera (2004), p. 93</ref>

==Economy==
The economy of the Anuradhapura Kingdom was based mainly on [[agriculture]].<ref name="Yogasundaram 2008, p. 66">Yogasundaram (2008), p. 66</ref> The main agricultural product was [[rice]], the cultivation of which was supported by an intricate irrigation network. Rice cultivation began around the [[Malvatu oya]], [[Dediri oya]] and [[Mahaweli river]] and spread throughout the country.<ref>Siriweera (2004), p. 183</ref> [[Shifting cultivation]] was also done during the rainy seasons.<ref>Goonaratne and Hirashima (1990), p. 153</ref> Rice was produced in two main seasons named ''Yala'' and ''Maha''. Due to the extensive production of rice, the country was mostly [[self sufficient]].<ref>Siriweera (2004), p. 190</ref> [[Cotton]] was grown extensively to meet the requirements of [[cloth]]. [[Sugarcane]] and [[Sesame]] were also grown and there are frequent references in classical literature to these agricultural products. [[Finger millet]] was grown as a substitute for rice, particularly in the dry zone of the country.<ref name="Siriweera 2004, p. 182">Siriweera (2004), p. 182</ref> These products, mainly rice, were exported.<ref>Siriweera (2004), p. 192</ref>

The primary goods exported during the Anuradhapura period are [[gems]], [[spices]], [[pearls]] and [[elephants]], while [[ceramic ware]], [[silks]], [[perfumes]] and [[wines]] were imported from other countries.<ref>Siriweera (1994), p. 114</ref> Foreign merchants, mainly Arabs, often acted as [[middlemen]] in these imports and exports.<ref name="Yogasundaram 2008, p. 66"/> Luxury cloth was also imported from [[Eastern India]] and [[China]].<ref name="Siriweera 2004, p. 182"/> A [[Epigraphy|stone inscription]] in Anuradhapura implies that the market or [[bazaar]] was an important functionality in the city.<ref>Siriweera (2004), p. 207</ref> Trade was limited in villages since they were mostly self sufficient, but essential commodities such as salt and metal had to be obtained from outside.<ref>Siriweera (2004), p. 212</ref> The country's position in the Indian Ocean and its natural bays made it a centre of international trade transit.<ref>Siriweera (2004), p. 218</ref> Ports such as ''Mahatittha'' ([[Mannar]]) and ''Gokanna'' ([[Trincomalee]]) were used as trading ports during the Anuradhapura Kingdom.<ref>Siriweera (2004), p. 228</ref>

Currency was often used for settling judicial fines, [[taxes]] and payments for goods<ref group="N">According to ''[[Samantapasadika]]'', the use of coins in transactions involving the purchasing of items had become common by 5 century AD.</ref> or services.<ref>Siriweera (1994), p 120</ref> However, remuneration for services to the king, officials and temples were often made in the form of land revenue. The oldest coins found at Anuradhapura date up to 200 BC.<ref>Siriweera (2004), p. 213</ref> These earliest coins were [[Hammered coinage|punch marked]] rectangular pieces of silver known as ''[[kahavanu]]''. These eventually became circular in shape, and these were followed by [[Milled coinage|die struck]] coins.<ref>Siriweera (2004), p. 214</ref> Uncoined metals, particularly [[gold]] and [[silver]], were used for trading as well.<ref>Siriweera (2004), p. 215</ref> Patterns imprinted on the coins of this period include elephants, horses, [[swastika]] and [[Dharmacakra]].<ref>Codrington (1994), p. 19</ref> 

The primary tax of this period was named ''bojakapati'' (grain tax) and charged for land used for cultivation.<ref>Siriweera (1994), p. 167</ref> A water tax, named ''dakapati'' was also charged for the water used from reservoirs.<ref>Siriweera (1994), p. 168</ref> [[Duty (economics)|Customs duties]] were also imposed in ports.<ref>Siriweera (1994), p. 169</ref> Those unable to pay these taxes in cash were expected to take part in services such as repairing reservoirs. The administration of taxes was the duty of ''Badagarika'', the king's treasurer.<ref>Siriweera (1994), p. 170</ref>

==Culture==
The culture during the Anuradhapura Kingdom was largely based on Buddhism. Slaughter of animals for food was considered low and unclean. Therefore the rearing of animals, except for [[bubalus|buffalo]] and [[cattle]], was not common. [[Elephants]] and [[horses]] were prestige symbols, and could only be afforded by the nobility. The skills needed to train and care for these animals were regarded highly.<ref>Siriweera (2004), p. 200</ref> Cattle and buffalo were used for [[ploughing]] and preparing [[paddy fields]].<ref>Siriweera (2004), p. 193</ref> [[Dairy products]] formed an important part of the diet, and [[Pali]] and [[Sinhala]] literature often refer to five products obtained from the cow; [[milk]], [[curd]], [[buttermilk]], [[ghee]] and [[butter]].<ref>Siriweera (2004), p. 194</ref> Bullocks and [[bullock carts]] were also used for transport.<ref>Siriweera (2004), p. 195</ref>

Metalwork was an important and well developed craft, and metal tools such as [[axes]], [[Mammoty|mammoties]] and [[Hoe (tool)|hoes]] have been widely. Weapons and tools of iron and steel were produced in large scale for the military.<ref>Ellawala (1969), p. 151</ref> A good indication of the development of metalwork of this period is the [[Lovamahapaya]], which had been roofed entirely with copper.<ref>Ellawala (1969), p. 152</ref>

Villages were usually concentrated around irrigation tanks to enable easy access to water for agriculture. The houses were located immediately below the [[tank bund]], between the tank and the paddy fields. This allowed easy controlling of the water to the fields and also allowed the maintenance of [[home gardens]] for fruits and vegetables.<ref>Siriweera (2004), p. 187</ref> A village typically consisted of a cluster of dwellings, paddy tract, reservoir, grazing ground, [[Shifting cultivation|shift crop]] reserve and the village forest. In rain fed areas, a [[Perennial stream|perennial watercourse]] often took the place of the reservoir.<ref name="Rambukwelle 1993, p. 38"/> Inland [[fishing]] was widespread during the Anuradhpura Kingdom because of the numerous reservoirs.<ref>Siriweera (2004), p. 201</ref> Although not entirely absent, sea fishing was not common during this period mainly because of the rudimentary nature of transporting sea fish to cities which were located far inland.<ref>Siriweera (1994), p. 39</ref>

Women appear to have been allowed considerable freedom and independence during this period.<ref>Ellawala (1969), p. 82</ref> Dutthagamani frequently sought his mother's advice during his military campaign.<ref name="Unsurpassed heroism">{{cite web|url=http://www.sundayobserver.lk/2008/08/17/plus01.asp|title=Unsurpassed heroism: Women in Mahavamsa|last=Wettimuny|first=Samangie |date=2008-08-17|work=Sunday Observer|accessdate=2009-07-17}}</ref> Rock inscriptions show that women donated caves and temples for the use of the sangha. However, there are no records of women holding any administrative posts. It is not clear if women were given equal footing with men, but they did have complete freedom in religious matters.<ref>Ellawala (1969), p. 83</ref>

===Religion===
After the introduction of Buddhism to Sri Lanka during the reign of Devanampiya Tissa, it spread throughout the country under his patronage.<ref>Siriweera (2004), p. 244</ref> After this, the rulers were expected to be the protectors of Buddhism in the country  and it became a legitimizing factor of royal authority.<ref>Siriweera (2004), p. 245</ref> Three fraternities of Buddhism had come into existence by the end of the Anuradhapura Kingdom; Mahavihara, Abhayagiri and Jetavana. [[Mahavihara]] was established immediately after the introduction of Buddhism to the country. Representing the Theravada teachings, it remained strictly conventional throughout the Anuradhapura Kingdom. The Abhayagiri fraternity, established after [[Abhayagiriya]] was built, which represented several schools of Buddhist thought. It did not restrict itself to Theravada and accepted Mahayana and Tantric ideas as well. Little evidenece exists on the Jetavana fraternity which was established after the [[Jetavanaramaya]] was built, later than the other two. However, it too was receptive to new and more liberal views regarding buddhism.<ref>Siriweera (2004), p. 248</ref>

Rulers sponsored [[Theravada]] and often took steps to stop the spreading of [[Mahayana]] beliefs. Rulers such as [[Aggabodhi I]], [[Kashyapa V]] and [[Mahinda IV]] promulgated disciplinary rules for the proper conduct of the Sangha.<ref name="Siriweera 1994, p. 8"/> [[Voharika Tissa]] and [[Gothabhaya]] expelled several monks from the order for supporting such views.<ref>Siriweera (2004), p. 246</ref> A change in this occurred when Mahasen exmbraced Mahayana teachings and acted against Theravada institutions. However, he too accommodated Theravada teachings after the population rebelled against him.<ref>Siriweera (2004), p. 247</ref> As the kingdom and the authority or kings declined, Mahayana and Tantric doctrines again began to spread, however, Theravada remained the main and most widespread doctrine.<ref>Siriweera (2004), p. 250</ref> 

Followers of [[Hinduism]] were also present to some extent during the Anuradhapura Kingdom. There were a number of them in Rajarata during Elara's reign. Mahasen setroyed several Hindu temples during his reign in the second century. Particularly Indian merchant communities living near ports such as ''Mahatittha'' and ''Gokanna'' were followers of Hinduism and Hindu temples were constructed in these areas. By the end of the Anuradhapura Kingdom, large Hindu temples such as the [[Konesvaram temple]] had been constructed.<ref>Siriweera (2004), p. 254</ref> Historical sources<ref group="N">The term ''historical sources'' used in this article refer to the ancient texts on the history of Sri Lanka, mainly [[Mahavamsa]] and [[Dipavamsa]].</ref> indicate that there were also [[Jainism|Jains]] in Anuradhapura during the reign of Valagamba.<ref>Mendis (1999), p. 104</ref>

===Literature===
From third century BC to third century AD, inscriptions are recorded in the [[Brahmi]] script. This gradually developed into the modern [[sinhala]] script, but this was not complete by the end of the Anuradhapura Kingdom. The first reference in historical sources to any written work is about 80 BC, but  both Sinhala and Pali literature existed even two centuries before this, if not earlier.<ref>Ellawala (1969), p. 87</ref> The oldest Sinhala literature is found at [[Sigiriya]].<ref>Siriweera (2004), p. 267</ref> Poems written from the sixth century to the end of the Anuradhaura kingdom are found among the graffiti on the mirror wall at Sigiriya. Most of these verses are describing or even addressed to the female figures depicted in the frescoes of Sigiriya.<ref>Lokubandara (2007), p. 37</ref> The majority of these poems have been written between the 8th and 10th centuries.<ref>Lokubandara (2007), p. 29</ref> 

Only three Sinhala books survive from the Anuradhapura period. One of them, ''Siyabaslakara'', was written in the ninth or tenth century on the art of poetry and is based on the [[Sanskrit]] ''Kavyadarsha''. ''Dampiya Atuva Gatapadaya'' is another, and is a glossary for the [[Pali]] ''Dhammapadatthakatha'', providing Sinhala words and synonyms for Pali words. The third book is ''Mula Sikha Ha Sikhavalanda'', a set of disciplinary rules for Buddhist monks. Both these have been written during the last two centuries of the Anuradhapura period.<ref>Siriweera (2004), p. 268</ref>

During the reign of Valagamba, the Pali ''[[Tripitaka]]'' was written in palm leaves.<ref>Ellawala (1969), p. 86</ref> Several commentaries on Buddhism, known as ''Atthakatha'' have also been written during the reign of [[Mahanama of Sri Lanka|Mahanama]]. Pali chronicles such as [[Dipavamsa]] and [[Mahavamsa]] have been written during the Anuradhapura Kingdom, and are still useful as resources for studying the history of the country.<ref>Siriweera (2004), p. 271</ref><ref>Mendis (1999), p. 1</ref>

===Art===
[[File:Sigiriya frescoes.jpg|thumb|The Sigiriya frescoes are the oldest and best preserved paintings belonging to the Anuradhapura period.]]
The oldest surviving paintings of the Anuradhapura period are the Sigiriya frescoes.<ref name="Siriweera 2004, p. 290">Siriweera (2004), p. 290</ref> These fifth century paintings, dating back to the reign of Kashyapa I at Sigiriya, depict female figures carrying flowers. Various theories exist as to who are shown in these paintings, suggesting that they are [[Apsara|''apsaras'']] (celestial nymphs),<ref>Bandaranayake (2007), p. 8</ref> ladies of the king's court or even a representation of lightning and rain clouds.<ref>Bandaranayake (2007), p. 11</ref> Although they bear certain similarities to the [[Ajanta Caves|paintings of Ajanta]], there are major differences as well, suggesting that these are examples of a distinctive Sri Lankan school of art.<ref>Bandaranayake (2007), p. 12</ref> 

Paintings from a cave at [[Hindagala]] date back to the late Anuradhapura period, and may even belong to the same period as the Sigiriya paintings. The paintings of Sigiriya and Hindagala are the only surviving specimens of art of the Anuradhapura Kingdom. However, remnants of paintings indicate that walls and ceilings of some buildings and the inside walls of ''stupas'' and ''vahalkadas'' were also painted.<ref name="Siriweera 2004, p. 290"/> Saddhatissa had employed painters to decorate the Ruwanweli Seya when his brother Dutthagamani wanted to see it on his death bed.<ref>Ellawala (1969), p. 153</ref>

Statue making, most noticeably [[Buddharupa|statues of the Buddha]], was an art perfected by the Sri Lankan sculptors during the Anuradhapura Kingdom. The earliest Buddha statues belonging to the Anuradhapura period date back to the first century AD.<ref>Siriweera (2004), p. 286</ref> Standard postures such as ''Abhaya Mudra'', ''Dhyana Mudra'', ''Vitarka Mudra'' and ''Kataka Mudra'' were used when making these statues. The [[Samadhi statue]] in Anuradhapura, showing the Buddha in a seated position in deep meditation, is sculpted from [[dolomite]] marble and is datable to the fourth century AD. The [[Toluvila statue]] is similar to this, and dates to the later stages of the Anuradhapura Kingdom. Notable standing Buddha statues dating from the Anuradhapura period include the ones at [[Avukana]], [[Maligavila]] and [[Buduruvagala]]. The Buduruvagala statue is the tallest in the country, standing at {{convert|50|ft|m}}. All these statues are carved out of rock.<ref>Siriweera (2004), p. 287</ref>

The carvings at [[Isurumuniya]] are some of the best examples of the [[stone carving]] art of the Anuradhapura Kingdom. Skill in arts was a respected and valued trait during this period and artists were well rewarded by the rulers. The Mahavamsa records that [[Jetthatissa II]] was himself skilled in stone and [[ivory carving]].<ref>Fernando (2001), p. 3</ref>

===Architecture===
[[File:Ruwanwelisaya.jpg|thumb|Dutthagamani constructed Ruwanweli Seya, the first large stupa, beginning a practice which would be followed by subsequent rulers.]]
The construction of [[stupas]] was noticeable not only during the Anuradhapura Kingdom but throughout the history of Sri Lanka. Stupas were built enshrining an object of worship. The stupa of [[Thuparamaya]], built by Devanampiya Tissa, is one of the earliest built and was constructed immediately after the arrival of Buddhism. The construction of large stupas was begun by Dutthagamani with the construction of the [[Ruwanweli Seya]], standing {{convert|300|ft|m}} high with a circumference of {{convert|298|ft|m}}.<ref>Siriweera (2004), p. 283</ref> 
{{quote|The Anuradhapura dagabas which date from the early centuries of the Anuradhapura period, are of such colossal proportions that they constitute the largest structures of their type anywhere in the Buddhist World, even rivaling the Pyramids of Egypt in size.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://whc.unesco.org/archive/periodicreporting/apa/cycle01/section2/200.pdf|title=Periodic Reporting Exercise on the Application of the World Heritage Convention|publisher=UNESCO|accessdate=2009-07-18}}</ref>}}
The [[Abhayagiri Dagaba|Abhayagiri]] stupa in the Abhayagiriya monastic complex is another large stupa of the Anuradhapura period the original height of which was {{convert|350|ft|m}}. The [[Jetavanaramaya|Jetavana]] stupa, constructed by Mahasen, is the largest in the country.<ref>Siriweera (2004), p. 284</ref> Stupas had deep and well constructed foundations, and the builders were clearly aware of the attributes of the materials used for construction. Suitable methods for each type of material have been used to lay foundations on a firm basis.<ref>Basnayake (1986), p. 109</ref>

All buildings have been adorned with elaborate carvings and sculptures and were supported by large stone columns. These stone columns can be seen in several buildings such as the [[Lovamahapaya]] (brazen palace).<ref>Siriweera (2004), p. 280</ref> [[Sewage|Drainage systems]] of these buildings are also well planned, and [[terra cotta]] pipes were used to carry water to drainage pits. Large ponds were attached to some monasteries, such as the [[Kuttam Pokuna]] (twin pond). Hospital complexes have also been found close to monasteries. Buildings were constructed using timber, bricks and stones. Stones were used for foundations and columns, while brick were used for walls. Lime mortar was used for plastering walls.<ref>Siriweera (2004), p. 281</ref>

==Irrigation and water management==
[[Rainfall]] in the dry zone of Sri Lanka is limited to 50-75 inches. Under these conditions, rain fed cultivation was difficult, forcing early settlers to develop means to store water in order to maintain a constant supply of water for their cultivations. Small irrigation tanks were constructed at village level, to support the cultivations of that village.<ref>Siriweera (2004), p. 168</ref> The earliest medium-scale irrigation tank is the Basawakkulama reservoir built by Pandukabhaya. Nuwara wewa and Tissa wewa reservoirs were constructed a century later. These reservoirs were enlarged in subsequent years by various rulers.<ref>Siriweera (2004), p. 169</ref> 

Construction of large scale reservoirs began in the first century AD under the direction of [[Vasabha]]. The Alahara canal, constructed by damming the [[Amban river]] to divert water to the west for {{convert|30|mi|km}}, was constructed during this period. Among the reservoirs constructed during the reign of Vasabha, Mahavilacchiya and Nocchipotana reservoirs both have circumferences of about {{convert|2|mi|km}}. During the reign of Mahasen, the Alahara canal was widened and lengthened to supply water to the newly constructed Minneriya tank, which covered {{convert|4670|acre|km2}} and had a {{convert|1.25|mi|km}} long and {{convert|44|ft|m}} high embankment. He was named ''Minneri Deiyo'' (god of Minneriya) and is still referred to as such by the people in that area.<ref>Mendis (1999), p. 74</ref>  The Kavudulu reservoir, Pabbatanta canal and Hurulu reservoir were among the large irrigation constructions carried out during this period. These constructions contributed immensely to the improvement of agriculture in the northern and eastern parts of the dry zone. Reservoirs were also constructed using tributaries of the [[Daduru Oya]] during this period, thereby supplying water to the south western part of the dry zone. This conservation and distribution of water resources ensured that the water supply was sufficient throughout the dry zone.<ref name="Siriweera 2004, p. 170">Siriweera (2004), p. 170</ref> [[James Emerson Tennent]]<ref group="N">Sir James Emerson Tennent was the [[Colonial Secretary]] of [[Ceylon]] from 1845 to 1850. He has written several books on the country and its history.</ref> described the ancient irrigation network as:

{{quote|... there seems every reason to believe that from their own subsequent experience and the prodigious extent to which they occupied themselves in the formulation of works of this kind, they attained a facility unsurpassed by the people of any other country.<ref>Mendis (2000), p. 248</ref>}}

The water resources of the dry zone were further exploited during the times of [[Upatissa I]] and [[Dhatusena]]. The construction of the Kala wewa, covering an area of {{convert|6380|acre|km2}} with an embankment {{convert|3.75|mi|km}} long and {{convert|40|ft|m}} high, was done during Dhatusena's reign. A {{convert|54|mi|km}} canal named the Jayaganga carries water from the Kala wewa to the Tissa Wewa and feeds a network of smaller canals. The construction of this network is also attributed to Dhatusena. The Jayaganga supplied water to 180 square kilometres of paddy fields.<ref name="Siriweera 2004, p. 170"/> By the end of the fifth century AD, two major irrigation networks, one supported by the [[Mahaweli river]] and the other by [[Malvatu Oya]] and [[Kala Oya]], were covering the ''Rajarata'' area. The Mahavamsa records that many other rulers constructed a number of irrigation tanks, some of which have not yet been identified. By the eighth century, large tanks such as Padaviya, Naccaduva, Kantale and Giritale had come into existence, further expanding the irrgiation network. However, from the eighth century to the end of the Anuradhapura Kingdom, there wasn't much activity in construction of irrigation works.<ref>Siriweera (2004), p. 171</ref>

===Technology===
Advanced technology was required for the planning and construction of large reservoirs and canals. When constructing reservoirs, the gaps between low [[ridges]] in the dry zone plains were used for [[damming]] water courses. Two different techniques were used in construction; one method involved making an embankment using natural rock formations across a valley and the other involved diverting water courses through constructed canals to reservoirs. All the reservoirs and canals in an area were interconnected by an intricate network, so that excess water from one will flow into the other.<ref>Siriweera (2004), p. 174</ref> 

The {{convert|54|mi|km}} long Jayaganga has a gradient of six inches to the mile, which indicates that the builders had expert knowledge and accurate measuring devices to achieve the minimum gradient in the water flow. The construction of ''[[Bisokotuva]]'', a cistern sluice used to control the outward flow of water in reservoirs, indicates a major advancement in irrigation technology. Since the third century, these sluices, made of brick and stone, were placed at various levels in the embankments of reservoirs.<ref>Siriweera (2004), p. 175</ref>

==Military==
During the early stages, the Anuradhapura Kingdom did not have a strong regular army except for a small body of soldiers. These were assigned for the guarding of the city and royal palace. The King had the right to demand an able bodied son for military service from every family in his kingdom. In times of war, a larger army was formed using this method. An army consisted of four main divisions; an elephant corps, cavalry, chariots and infantry.<ref name="Yogasundaram 2008, p. 66"/> This combination was called ''Chaturangani Sena'' (fourfold army). However, the majority of the army was infantry composed of swordsmen, spearmen and archers.<ref>Siriweera (2004), p. 89</ref><ref>Ellawala (1969), p.148</ref> 

When such an army was prepared, it was commanded by several generals. The [[Commander-in-Chief]] of the army was usually a member of nobility. The King and his generals led the army from the front during battles, mounted on [[War elephant|elephants]].<ref name="Yogasundaram 2008, p. 66"/> The major cities of the kingdom were defended with [[defensive walls]] and [[moats]]. [[Sieges]], often lasting several months, were common during warfare. Single combat between the opposing kings or commanders, mounted on elephants, often decided the outcome of the battle.<ref name="Yogasundaram 2008, p. 67">Yogasundaram (2008), p. 67</ref>

South Indian [[mercenaries]] were often employed in the armies of the Anuradhapura Kingdom during its latter stages.<ref name="Yogasundaram 2008, p. 66"/> [[Manavamma]] and [[Moggallana I]] obtained the assistance of the [[Pallava]]s during succession disputes to secure the throne.<ref>Siriweera (2004), p. 42</ref> However, the Anuradhapura kingdom appears to have had strong armies during some periods, such as when King Sena II sent his armies to South India against the [[Pandyan Kingdom|Pandyan]] king.<ref>Wijesooriya (2006), p. 110</ref> [[Gajabahu I]] also launched an invasion against South India to rescue 12,000 captives, and brought back 12,000 prisoners as well as the freed captives.<ref>Mendis (1999), p. 57</ref> Surprisingly however, a navy was not considered important during the Anuradhapura Kingdom, and one was rarely maintained. This would have been the first line of defence for an island nation and would also have been helpful in dealing with invasions from South India.<ref name="Yogasundaram 2008, p. 67"/>
