'''Arnold Zweig''' ([[November 10]] [[1887]] &ndash; [[November 26]] [[1968]]) was a [[Germany|German]] [[writer]] and an active pacifist.

==Life and work==
Zweig was born in Glogau, Silesia (today [[Glogow]], [[Poland]]) son of a Jewish saddler. After attending a [[gymnasium (school)|gymnasium]] in Kattowitz ([[Katowice]]), he made extensive studies in history, philosophy and literature at several universities -  Breslau ([[Wroc<U+0142>aw]]), [[Munich]], [[Berlin]], [[G<U+00F6>ttingen]], [[Rostock]] and [[T<U+00FC>bingen]]. He was especially influenced by [[Friedrich Nietzsche]]'s thinking.

His first literary works ''Novellen um Claudia'' (1913) and ''Ritualmord in Ungarn'' gain him wider recognition.

Zweig volunteered for the German army in [[World War I]] and saw action as a private in France, Hungary and Serbia.  The war changed him from a Prussian patriot to an eager pacifist. 

By the end of the war he was assigned to the Press department of the German Army Headquarters in Kaunas and there he was first introduced to the East European Jewish organisations.

In a quite literal effort to put a face to the hated ''Ostjude'' (Eastern European Jew), due to their Orthodox, economically depressed, "unenlightened," "un-German" ways, Zweig published with the artist Hermann Struck ''Das ostj<U+00FC>dische Antlitz'' (''The Face of East European Jewry'') in 1920.  This was a blatant effort to at least gain sympathy among German Jews for the plight of their eastern European brethren.  With the help of many simple sketches of faces, Zweig supplied interpretations and meaning behind them.

After World War I he was an active socialistic [[zionist]] in Germany. After [[Hitler]]'s attempted coup in [[1923]] Zweig went to Berlin and worked there as the editor-in-chief of a newspaper "J<U+00FC>dische Rundschau". 

In the 1920s, Zweig was taken by the psychiatric theories of [[Sigmund Freud]] and underwent Freudian therapy.  In March 1927, Zweig wrote to Freud asking permission to dedicate his new book to Freud.  In the letter Zweig told Freud: "I personally owe to your psychological therapy the restoration of my whole personality, the discovery that I was suffering from a neurosis and finally the curing of this neurosis by your method of treatment."

Freud returned this ardent letter with a warm letter of his own, and the Freud-Zweig correspondence continued for a dozen years -- momentous years in Germany's history.  This correspondence is extensive and interesting enough to have been published in book form. 

In 1927, Zweig published the pacifist novel ''The Case of Sergeant Grischa,'' which made him an international literary figure.

From [[1929]] he was a contributing journalist of anti-Nazi newspaper ''[[Die Weltb<U+00FC>hne]]'' (''World Stage''). 

When the [[Nazis]] took power in Germany in 1933, Zweig was one of many Jews who packed their bags and went into exile.  Zweig went first to [[Czechoslovakia]], then [[Switzerland]] and [[France]]. After spending some time with [[Thomas Mann]], [[Lion Feuchtwanger]], [[Anna Seghers]] and [[Bertolt Brecht]] in France he set out for [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]]. 

In [[Haifa]], Palestine he published a German [[newspaper]] "Orient". During the years spent in Palestine he became disillusioned with Zionism and turned to [[socialism]]. 

In 1948, after a formal invitation from the East German government, Zweig decided to return to the [[Soviet Zone]] (later called the [[GDR]]).

In East Germany he was in many ways involved in the communist system.  He was a member of parliament, delegate to the [[World Peace Council]] Congresses and the cultural advisory board of the communist party. He was President of the German Academy of the Arts from 1950-53. 

He was rewarded with many prizes and medals by the regime.  The [[USSR]] awarded  him the [[Lenin Peace Prize]] (1958) for his anti-war novels.

After 1962, due to poor health, Zweig virtually withdrew from the political and artistic fields.

Arnold Zweig died in [[East Berlin]] on the November 26, [[1968]]. 

He is best known for his World War I tetralogy.
