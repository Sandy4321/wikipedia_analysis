== History of Sixt rent a car ==
[[File:Transporter Sixt.jpg|thumb|[[Iveco Daily]] with Sixt]]

Sixt was founded in 1912 with three vehicles in downtown [[Munich]]. At the time of its launch it had only three cars: a Deutz Landauler de Luxe, and two [[Daimlers]].  It was originally called "Martin Sixt Autofahrten",<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sixt.com/further-information/history-of-sixt/|title=History of Sixt |publisher=}}</ref> bearing the founder's full name.

Martin Sixt was tested early in his venture. During [[World War I]] Martin Sixt was left without vehicles when they were taken for military purposes. After the war, he renamed the business "Sixt Autofahrten". The business was soon confronted with a familiar circumstance as [[World War II]] came about. In an effort to escape its earlier fate, Sixt hid three of its cars during the course of the war. Once the war was over, Sixt brought out these three vehicles and once again became a car rental company.

Sixt has been passed down from generation to generation and is now being run by the third generation of the Sixt family. Several family members manage the company: Erich Sixt (CEO), [[Regine Sixt]] (Marketing), Alexander Sixt (Corporate Development), Konstantin Sixt (Online).
