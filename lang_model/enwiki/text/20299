In [[France]], the '''Conseil d'<U+00C9>tat''' ([[English language|English]]: '''Council of State''') is an organ of the French national government. Its functions include assisting the executive with legal advice and being the supreme court for [[administrative justice]]. Its members are (for the most part) high level [[jurist]]s.

==Organisation==

The presidency of the Conseil d'<U+00C9>tat is held by the [[vice-president]]. The general assembly of the Council of State may be presided by the [[prime minister of France|prime minister]], or, in his absence, the [[Minister of Justice (France)|justice minister]].<ref>[http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/WAspad/UnArticleDeCode?code=CJUSADML.rcv&art=L121-7 Code of administrative justice, article L121-7]</ref> The vice-president of the Conseil is considered, for ceremonial purposes, the foremost [[civil servant]] in [[France]]. 
The current vice-president is [[Jean-Marc Sauv<U+00E9>]].

Other members of the Council include, by decreasing rank:
* presidents of sections;
* councillors in ordinary service;
* councillors in extraordinary service;
* masters of requests;
* first class auditors;

The Conseil is seated in the [[Palais Royal]] in [[Paris]].

The Conseil is divided into 6 sections:
* The litigation section (''section du contentieux'') &mdash; see below.
* The section of the report and studies (''section du rapport et des <U+00E9>tudes'') writes the annual report, conducts studies and helps in ensuring the proper execution of litigation decisions.
* The finance section (''section des finances''), interior section (''section de l'int<U+00E9>rieur''), social section (''section sociale''), public works section (''section des travaux publics'') reviews all ordinances, all statute projects drafted by the Council of Ministers as well as all decrees for which that review is compulsory (''d<U+00E9>crets en Conseil d'<U+00C9>tat''). Such reviews are nonbinding, but they are compulsory.

The Conseil d'<U+00C9>tat may also review legal problems addressed to it by the Ministers.<ref>[http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/WAspad/UnArticleDeCode?code=CJUSADML.rcv&art=L112-2 Code of administrative justice, L112-2]</ref> It is also charged with the inspection of administrative courts.<ref>[http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/WAspad/UnArticleDeCode?code=CJUSADML.rcv&art=L133-5 Code of administrative justice, L112-5]</ref>

==History==
The origins of the Conseil d'<U+00C9>tat go back to the 13th Century, where it appears under various names, sometimes as "Conseil priv<U+00E9>" or "Conseil des parties" ("Privy Counsel") and sometimes as "Conseil d'<U+00C9>tat".  It brought together lawyers (legists was probably a more accurate term) to provide counsel to the king with respect to law suits. Officially instituted in 1557, this was the largest of the royal counsels (see [[Conseil du Roi]]), composed of the [[Chancellor of France|chancellor]], the dukes with peerage, the ministers and secretaries of state, the [[contr<U+00F4>leur g<U+00E9>n<U+00E9>ral des finances]], the 30 [[Conseiller d'<U+00C9>tat|counsellors of state]], the 80 [[ma<U+00EE>tre des requ<U+00EA>tes]] and the [[intendant]]s of finance.

The kings, who held the capacity to dispense justice and render judgments as the court of last resort, let that power be exercised by courts and [[parlement]]s. But the king still retained the power to override them at will. In particular, the kings continued to decide great issues and to make decisions when the acts of their administration were disputed. The decisions of the king<U+2019>s Conseil d'<U+00C9>tat were regarded as being issued under <U+201C>restrained justice<U+201D> (that is the self-restraint of the sovereign).  The legists also assisted the king in the development of new laws in addition to their exercise of <U+201C>restrained justice<U+201D>.

''For more on the French government administration during the "[[ancien r<U+00E9>gime]]", see [[Ancien R<U+00E9>gime in France]].''

The current ''Conseil d'<U+00C9>tat'' was created under the [[French Consulate|Consulate]] in [[1799]] as a judicial authority responsible for lawsuits against the State and charged with helping in the drafting of the most important legislation. The [[First Consul]] (later [[Emperor]]) presided over its sessions, and the Council performed many of the functions of a [[Cabinet]].  After the [[Bourbon Restoration]], the Council was retained as an administrative court but without its former prominence.

Its role was better defined by the law of [[1872]].

==Advisory role==
Certain kinds of government decisions must be referred to the ''Conseil d'<U+00C9>tat'' for advisory review. These include:
* All government draft legislation (bills) before it is sent to Parliament. Bills proposed by members of the Parliament do not undergo this procedure.
* Certain [[decree]]s, known as ''d<U+00E9>crets en Conseil d'<U+00C9>tat''. These decrees, signed by the Prime Minister and the ministers with the scope of the decree, are [[secondary legislation]]: they define the implementation details of laws. Typically, a law will authorize, prescribe or prohibit an action defined in broad terms, and call for a ''d<U+00E9>cret en Conseil d'<U+00C9>tat'' to define the details.

The advisory workload is divided between the various administrative sections of the Conseil according to the government ministry or subdivision thereof primarily concerned by the decision.

==Litigation==
The ''Conseil'' for the system of administrative justice.
It hears both recourses against [[decree]]s and other executive decisions from the [[President]] of the Republic and the cabinet ministers, as well as appellate cases from lower administrative courts. Its decisions are final.

While the Conseil is strictly speaking not a court, it functions much like one with respect to litigation. Plaintiffs are represented by [[lawyer]]s drawn from the same exclusive [[bar (law)|bar]] as the [[Court of Cassation (France)|Court of Cassation]].

===First instance litigation===
The ''Conseil'' hears cases against decisions of the national government ([[decree]]s, regulations issued by ministers, decisions by committees with a national competency) as well as recourses pertaining to regional elections.

The Conseil d'<U+00C9>tat examines the conformance of regulations and administrative decisions with respect to the Constitution, higher administrative decisions, the general principles of Law, [[statute]] law, international treaties and conventions. The general principles of law are principles that are not found in any statute but derive from the spirit of the body of law; they are discovered by the Conseil and thus made into [[case law]].

The Conseil has full latitude to judge on the legality of any decision from the [[executive branch]], except for the very narrow category of "acts of government" where it judges itself incompetent. The Conseil itself has judged that such acts are restricted to:
* relationships between the executive branch and the [[legislative branch]] (whether to submit a law project to parliament...)
* acts that cannot be separated from the [[foreign policy]] of [[France]].
See the [http://www.conseil-etat.fr/ce/jurisp/index_ju_la03.shtml analysis on the Conseil's site] for more information (in French).

As such, the ''Conseil'' acts as a powerful check on the actions of the executive.

===Appellate jurisdiction===
The ''Conseil'' is the [[appellate court|appellate]] jurisdiction for decisions  of administrative courts (the 37 ''tribunaux administratifs'') regarding local elections.

It is the ''cassation'' jurisdiction for decisions by administrative courts of appeal (the 8 ''cours administratives d'appel''), meaning that it hears cases in which the plaintiff argues that the court of appeal ignored or misinterpreted law.

===Procedure===

The procedure is [[inquisitorial]]: the [[litigant]] writes a letter to the ''Conseil'', stating precisely what happened and why he feels that the defendant acted illegally; the ''Conseil'' then starts an inquiry, asking the other party (generally, a government or government agency) for precisions, and so on until the ''Conseil'' has a clear picture of the case. The litigant does not have the [[burden of proof]]: the ''Conseil'' may well decide that the litigant was right and the government was wrong if the information supplied by the litigant was sufficient to enable it to find the missing proofs. Of course, both parties may supply supplemental information until the case is ready for final judgment.

In some cases, it is unclear whether a case should be heard before [[administrative courts]] or [[judiciary courts]]. In this case, the ''tribunal des conflits'', made of equal number of members of the Conseil d'<U+00C9>tat and of judges from the [[Court of Cassation (France)|Court of Cassation]] and presided by the Minister of Justice is summoned.

===Main Decisions of the Conseil d'<U+00C9>tat===

As it renders final judicial review over almost all acts of the executive branch, the decisions of the Conseil d'<U+00C9>tat may be of considerable importance, often not for the actual case judged, but for the implications on the interpretation of law.
While France is a [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]] country and there is no formal rule of [[stare decisis]], lower courts follow the ''jurisprudence constante'' of the Conseil d'<U+00C9>tat. The major decisions of the Conseil d'<U+00C9>tat are collected into books and commented by academics; the [http://www.conseil-etat.fr/ official site of the Conseil] carries a [http://www.conseil-etat.fr/ce/jurisp/index_ju_la00.shtml list of comments on important decisions]. The interpretation of points of [[law]] forms the Conseil's [[doctrine]].

The decisions are named after the individual(s) or body who has appealed to the Council. The name of male individual used to be preceded by ''Sieur'', the name of female individuals by ''Dame'' or ''Demoiselle'' and the name of widows called by their husband's name ''Dame veuve''.

Among the important decisions are the following:

* [[February 19]], [[1875]] - [http://www.conseil-etat.fr/ce/jurisp/index_ju_la03.shtml Prince Napol<U+00E9>on]<br>The fact that a decision has been taken with political considerations does not make it an "act of government" that cannot be judged upon by the Conseil ([[reversal]] of previous [[doctrine]]). A prince had been removed from the army for political reasons. The council stated that his case had to be heard but was not founded because the law said that his position was revocable.

* [[May 28]], [[1954]] - [http://www.conseil-etat.fr/ce/jurisp/index_ju_la35.shtml Barel]. ''Freedom of opinion of [[French Civil Service|civil servants]].''<br>The administration cannot exclude people from applying for civil service positions solely on the basis of their political opinions. (Some [[communist]]s were refused admittance to the [[<U+00C9>cole nationale d'administration]]).

*  [[October 19]], [[1962]] - [http://www.conseil-etat.fr/ce/jurisp/index_ju_la39.shtml Canal, Robin & Godot]<br>The [[executive (government)|executive branch]] may take decisions by [[ordonnance|ordinance]] only in the narrowly defined field authorized by the [[habilitation law]]. The executive cannot decide the creation of [[court]]s whose procedures and absence of recourse are outside of the general principles of [[criminal law]].<br>This decision was the source of strong tensions between the Conseil and [[President of France|president]] [[Charles de Gaulle]].

* [[February 3]], [[1989]] - [http://www.conseil-etat.fr/ce/jurisp/index_ju_la43.shtml Alitalia corporation]<br>The [[executive (government)|executive branch]] has the duty to cancel illegal regulations, even if they were initially legal. Regulations must conform to [[European Union]] directives whose enactment period has expired.

* [[October 27]], [[1995]] - [http://www.conseil-etat.fr/ce/jurisp/index_ju_la47.shtml Commune of Morsang-sur-Orge], ''the "[[dwarf throwing]] case"''.<br>The respect of human dignity may be included in "public order". (A mayor had prohibited a dwarf-throwing attraction on grounds of public order, since this attraction did not respect human dignity.)<br>This decision nevertheless stops short of including [[morality]] in public order.

* [[March 3]], [[2004]] - [http://www.conseil-etat.fr/ce/actual/index_ac_lc0405.shtml The asbestos case].<br>The State may be held responsible for not taking appropriate measures, according to the current scientific knowledge, for protecting the workers' health (against asbestos), even if the workers work for private employers.
