'''Charles Louis Kades''' (March 12th, 1906 <U+2013> June 18th, 1996) was an American soldier and lawyer who served as both chief and deputy chief of [[Supreme Commander for the Allied Powers|GHQ]]'s Government Section in [[World War II]]. Kades played a central role in creating [[Supreme Commander for the Allied Powers|GHQ]]<U+2019>s draft of the [[Japanese constitution]], and profoundly affected the direction of [[Japan]] following [[World War II|the war]].

== Early Life ==
Kades was born to Jewish parents in Newburgh, New York. After graduating from [[Harvard Law School]] in 1930, Kades worked at the Manhattan law firm of Hawkins, Delafield, and Longfellow as a municipal bond lawyer.<ref name="asteria.fivecolleges">{{cite web|title=Charles L. Kades Papers, 1913-1997|url=http://asteria.fivecolleges.edu/findaids/amherst/ma214.html|accessdate=22 April 2013}}</ref> From 1933-1942, Kades helped implement [[New Deal]] policies as the Assistant General Counsel for the [[Public Works Administration]] and then the [[United States Department of Treasury]].<ref name="asteria.fivecolleges" />

== World War II, the Allied Occupation of Japan, and Revising the Japanese Constitution ==
An Army reservist since 1924, Kades entered active military duty with the US Army in 1942. After service in the Army Civil Affairs Division in Washington, he participated in the U.S. D-Day landing in Southern France in August, 1944.<ref>http://asteria.fivecolleges.edu/findaids/amherst/ma214.html</ref> Ten days after being promoted to the rank of colonel, Kades went to Japan as a member of the  [[Allied occupation of Japan|occupation forces]] on August 25, 1945.<ref name="asteria.fivecolleges" />  Although originally serving as the chief of [[Supreme Commander for the Allied Powers|GHQ]]'s Government Section, Kades became deputy chief following the arrival of the new chief, Major General [[Courtney Whitney]], in December, 1946.<ref>Kades, Charles L. 1989. "The American Role in Revising Japan's Imperial Constitution." Political Science Quarterly (The Academy of Political Science) 104 (2): 220.</ref> As deputy chief, Kades was ordered by [[Supreme Commander for the Allied Powers|Supreme Commander for the Allied Powers (SCAP)]] [[Douglas MacArthur]] to chair GHQ's Steering Committee on revising Japan's constitution.

=== Order to Revise the Constitution and committee formation ===

According to Kades, he was first informed of MacArthur's order for the Government Section to revise the Japanese constitution on February 3, 1946. Having concluded that the constitutional "revisions" presented by the Japanese the previous day were unacceptable, MacArthur decided that a "model" constitution was needed. These orders were given to Whitney, who then conveyed them to Kades along with notes in pencil dictating the following three principles that would shape the draft:

1. The Emperor is the head of state, his succession is dynastic, and his duties and powers are subject to the constitution and the people's will.

2. Japan renounces the right to war, and shall maintain no army, navy, or air force.

3. The Japanese feudal system is abolished, and all rights of peerage and nobility will be replaced with a system based on the British Parliament.<ref>Kades, Charles L. 1989. "The American Role in Revising Japan's Imperial Constitution." Political Science Quarterly (The Academy of Political Science) 104 (2): 222-224. </ref>

Upon receiving these orders, Kades became part of the three-man Steering Committee who would lead the drafting process. Kades, along with Lieutenant Colonel Frank Hays and Commander Alfred Hussey, decided to split the Government Section into seven committees that would each work on different sections of the constitution. Whitney accepted this idea, and announced it to Government Section on February 4, 1946 with orders to keep the project top secret. He gave the Government Section one week to complete the drafting process.<ref>Kades, Charles L. 1989. "The American Role in Revising Japan's Imperial Constitution." Political Science Quarterly (The Academy of Political Science) 104 (2): 225-226.</ref>

=== The drafting process ===

According to Kades, "the Steering Committee charged each committee with the responsibility of conforming its draft to the general principles set forth in a State-War-Navy Coordinating Committee's statement of policy entitled 'Reform of the Japanese Governmental System' (SWNCC 228)," and also to "...follow the format of the Meiji Constitution as closely as would be consistent with the changes each committee would recommend."<ref name="KadesCharles_a">Kades, Charles L. 1989."The American Role in Revising Japan's Imperial Constitution." Political Science Quarterly (The Academy of Political Science) 104 (2): 226.</ref>

Although the drafting process was completely controlled by Americans, the drafters did not simply import the American constitution, nor did they create a completely new constitution either. According to Kades, "Japanese sources were most useful. Used to good advantage were outlines of draft constitutions that had been published by the [Japanese]Progressive, Liberal, and Socialist Parties.<ref name="KadesCharles">Kades, Charles L. 1989."The American Role in Revising Japan's Imperial Constitution." Political Science Quarterly (The Academy of Political Science) 104 (2): 227.</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Dower|first=John|title=Embracing Defeat: Japan in the Wake of World War II|year=1999|publisher=W.W. Norton & Company, Inc.|location=New york|isbn=0-393-04686-9}} 356</ref> The drafters also referred to constitutions from approximately twelve other countries that were obtained by [[Beate Sirota]] and Lieutenant Milton Esman,<ref name="KadesCharles" /><ref>Gordon, Beate Sirota. 1997. The Only Woman in the Room. New York: Kodansha International Ltd. 107</ref> and Kades encouraged drafters to also consult the Meiji Constitution of 1889.<ref>Gordon, Beate Sirota. 1997. The Only Woman in the Room. New York: Kodansha International Ltd.109</ref>

From February 4 to February 7, each committee prepared and submitted their respective draft to the Steering Committee for advice on revision. After meeting with each committee on February 8 and 9, the Steering Committee submitted a consolidated draft to General Whitney on February 10 consisting of thirty-three articles.<ref>Gordon, Beate Sirota. 1997. The Only Woman in the Room. New York: Kodansha International Ltd.103-118</ref> MacArthur received this draft from Whitney the same day and approved it on February 11, making only one change. On February 12, the draft underwent final changes by the Steering Committee and members of the various Government Section committees, was again submitted to MacArthur via Whitney, and approved that night for submission to Japanese officials.<ref name="KadesCharles_a" />

=== Submitting the GHQ draft and the marathon drafting session ===

On February 13, 1946 Whitney and the Steering Committee members presented four copies of the completed GHQ draft to Foreign Minister [[Shigeru Yoshida]], Misister of State in charge of new constitution [[J<U+014D>ji Matsumoto]], Foreign ministry interpreter Genkichi Hasegawa, and Yoshida's aid [[Jir<U+014D> Shirasu]]. Whitney explained to these Cabinet members that their draft submitted on February 2 was wholly unacceptable and that a draft more acceptable to the supreme commander had been prepared for them. The Americans then moved to the garden of the residence and waited for about one hour as the Japanese officials read the draft. Yoshida explained that he could not comment on this draft before consulting with Prime Minister [[Kij<U+016B>r<U+014D> Shidehara]], to which Whitney replied that passing the draft was in the government's best interest and the four Americans left.<ref>Kades, Charles L. 1989."The American Role in Revising Japan's Imperial Constitution." Political Science Quarterly (The Academy of Political Science) 104 (2): 228.</ref>

After this meeting, the Japanese Cabinet replied with letters explaining that the American draft was too direct and contained ideas that would not work in Japan. Whitney reiterated the drafts benefits and explained that SCAP was prepared to present its draft to the Japanese people directly should the Cabinet refuse it.<ref>Kades, Charles L. 1989."The American Role in Revising Japan's Imperial Constitution." Political Science Quarterly (The Academy of Political Science) 104 (2): 231.</ref>

At 10:00 AM on March 4, 1946, Japanese Cabinet officials delivered a new draft based on GHQ's to SCAP headquarters. Whitney, the Steering Committee and translators/interpreters for GHQ immediately met with these Cabinet members to translate and discuss the draft. Japanese officials had removed and/or altered many ideas, such as popular sovereignty, which Kades insisted was unacceptable.<ref>Gordon, Beate Sirota. 1997. The Only Woman in the Room. New York: Kodansha International Ltd.122</ref> The two groups argued about these changes until Matsumoto left the meeting and relinquished responsibility to Tatsuo Sat<U+014D> and the remaining officials. At this point, it was decided that no one else could leave until a draft acceptable to both groups was completed. The two groups continued to argue about both the meaning of words and the inclusion of certain amendments. Negotiations continued until the evening of March 5, completing a thirty-two hour drafting session. This new draft was submitted to MacArthur immediately, who then approved it later that night. The Japanese published a translated outline the following day, and MacArthur publicly endorsed it.<ref>Kades, Charles L. 1989."The American Role in Revising Japan's Imperial Constitution." Political Science Quarterly (The Academy of Political Science) 104 (2): 232-233.</ref>

=== Constitutional debate in the Japanese government and adoption of a new Constitution ===

Following the elections of 1946, a special committee was appointed to study SCAP's draft, which had been presented as Japanese product. The draft was debated and amended, both directly by Japanese lawmakers and indirectly through SCAP, until being put up for a vote.<ref>Kades, Charles L. 1989."The American Role in Revising Japan's Imperial Constitution." Political Science Quarterly (The Academy of Political Science) 104 (2): 235-241.</ref> The constitution, which had undergone approximately thirty revisions by Japanese lawmakers, was adopted on October 7, 1946 by a vote of 421 to 8 in the House of Representatives and a vote of over 300 to 2 in the House of Peers. Emperor Hirohito announced the promulgation of this new constitution on November 3, 1946 and the constitution became effective on May 3, 1947.<ref>{{cite book|last=Dower|first=John|title=Embracing Defeat: Japan in the Wake of World War II|year=1999|publisher=W.W. Norton & Company, Inc.|location=New york|isbn=0-393-04686-9}} 392-401</ref>

== Military retirement and post-war life ==
On May 3rd, 1949, Kades resigned as deputy chief of the Government Section, choosing to leave Japan exactly two years from the day the Japanese constitution was adopted. Kades then returned New York where he worked as lawyer until retiring in 1976. He died in 1996 at the age of 90.<ref>{{cite news|last=Thomas|first=Robert|title=Charles Kades, 90, Architect Of Japan's Postwar Charter|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1996/06/21/world/charles-kades-90-architect-of-japan-s-postwar-charter.html|work=New York Times|publisher=New York Times|accessdate=21 April 2013}}</ref>

== Controversy involving Kades ==
A famous episode in Kades<U+2019> life involved an affair with Torio Tsuruyo. Following Kades<U+2019> participation in purging bureaucrats from the [[Ministry of Home Affairs (Japan)|Ministry of Home Affairs]], National Rural Police Director Noboru Sait<U+014D>, along with former ministry bureaucrats, supported [[G2]]{{dn|date=February 2014}} in an attempt to oust Kades. However, Kades learned of this plot through Lady Tsuruyo Torio, and had leaders of the police headquarters demoted. In addition, some believe that Kades, in order to disguise his motivations, distorted the truth and forced a special investigations unit of the Tokyo District Public Prosecutors Office to form a case against this group on charges of bureaucratic corruption.<ref><U+300E><U+653F><U+5B98><U+653B><U+9632><U+53F2><U+300F><U+FF08>[[<U+91D1><U+5B50><U+4EC1><U+6D0B>]], [[<U+6587><U+6625><U+65B0><U+66F8>]],1999<U+5E74></ref>
