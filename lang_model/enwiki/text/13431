An '''onsen''' (<U+6E29><U+6CC9>; often indicated on signs and maps by <U+6E6F> or <U+3086>, for hot water, or with the symbol <U+2668>) is a [[Japan]]ese [[hot spring]] bath. The onsen is basically a Japanese public bathhouse ([[sento]]) with natural hot spring water, and its history and etiquette are closely related to the [[sento]]. The onsen plays an important role in Japanese culture, providing socially institutionalised relief from the pressures of the contemporary Japanese twelve-hour [[work ethic]] and a chance for Japanese to break down the hierarchal nature of society through the mutual nakedness of [[skinship]].  Onsen have perennial popularity in Japan and onsen locations often appear on television.

==Characteristics of onsen==

Ideally, they should be outdoors (though many are indoors), use naturally hot water directly extracted from a natural volcanic spring, and they are often embellished with (or, in the cheaper varieties, replaced by) a wide variety of extravagant spa [[bath]]s, artificial waterfalls and saunas. The essential difference between an onsen and a [[sento]] (communal bath house) is that the water in an onsen must be volcanic spring in origin, even if reheated, whereas a sento may use ordinary heated water. Onsen water is often thought to have healing powers according to its mineral properties and onsens often have several different baths, each augmented by the addition of different minerals or the composition of the tub.

The most important features of the onsen by far are the water and the bathing facilities, which is why many bathers simply come for an hour or so to soak in the waters even if they do not stay. Probably the next most important issue for Japanese guests is the food; a good onsen inn (or [[Ryokan (inn)|ryokan]]) will offer what it claims is something special in the way of the evening meal. Because ryokan tend to gently pressure people towards eating their evening meal at set times (e.g. 6pm) the baths are often deserted around this hour of the day; this is a good time to hit the tub. While massage and other services are often offered, they are peripheral.

People often travel to onsen with work colleagues, as the relaxed and open atmosphere helps to break down some of the hierarchical stiffness inherent to Japanese work life. However, most visitors to onsen are not work groups but friends, couples and families. It is not unusual to see a father or mother introducing a small child to the onsen for the first time. Very small children of either sex up to about 8 years old can often be seen in both male and female baths. Mixed-sex bathing is a tradition that persists at onsen in the more rural areas of Japan, although these days there is usually a separate women-only bath in addition to the mixed bath.

==Onsen etiquette==

Note that at an onsen, as in [[sento]] you wash your body and rinse yourself thoroughly before you enter the hot water. This is vital in a public place as entering the onsen while still dirty or covered in soap can be very unsettling for others and may cause an uproar. At the very least, you should use the scoop provided to splash water over your genitals and feet, thus symbolically cleansing them. Wearing swimsuits is also explicitly forbidden at the more traditional onsen and would be considered odd at least.  People generally bring a small towel with them to use as a washcloth and for a modicum of modesty when walking between the washing area and the baths.  However, it is against the rules to immerse or dip towels in the onsen bath water as it would be unclean.  People normally set their towels off to the side of when enjoying the baths.  Onsens are generally considered a respite from the hectic pace of life and consequently they are usually quite quiet.  That being said, it is acceptable to strike up a conversation with other bathers in this relaxed situation.  Rowdiness in the washing area and the bathing area is looked down upon and generally prohibited.  A small amount of excess energy and splashing around is usually tolerated from children though.

==Recent controversy==

In recent years there has been some controversy over the banning of foreigners (or people who appear non-Japanese) from entering onsens because of stereotypes that they are unclean, rowdy and/or more prone to criminal activities.  But such instances are usually isolated and have decreased even more since this issue caught the attention of the mass media, largely because many onsen operators who practised such policies didn't want such negative press impacting their business.
