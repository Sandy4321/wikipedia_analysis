'''Bernard John Hunt, MBE''' (born [[2 February]] [[1930]]) is an [[England|English]] professional [[golf]]er. 

Hunt was born in [[Atherstone]], [[Warwickshire]]. He turned professional in 1946 and was a leading player on the European circuit in the 1950s and 1960s. He topped the Order of Merit, which was then points-based, in 1958, 1960 and 1965. The best season of his regular career in prize money terms was 1963, when he won <U+00A3>7,209. He was past his peak by the time the formal [[European Tour]] was introduced in 1972, but finished in the top twenty on the money list in 1973. He played on the [[European Seniors Tour]] in for its first seven seasons (1992-1998) but his opportunity to make an impact at this level was limited as he was sixty-two by the time the tour was founded. His best season was 1994, when he came fifteenth on the Order of Merit and earned <U+00A3>15,361. 

Between 1953 and 1969 Hunt represented Great Britain in the [[Ryder Cup]] eight times out of nine. His overall win-loss-half record was 6-16-6, but his record in singles was much better at 4-3-3. He was the non-playing captain of the Great Britain & Ireland teams of 1973 and 1975, both of which were defeated by the United States.
