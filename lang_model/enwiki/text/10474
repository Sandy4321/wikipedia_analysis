[[File:Zarih Jafer-at-Tayyar.JPG|thumb|Shrine of Ja'far al-Tayyar]]

'''Ja<U+2019>far ibn Abi Talib''' (c.590<U+2013>629 CE), also known as '''Ja<U+2019>far ''al-Tayyar''''', was a [[sahaba|companion]] of the Islamic prophet [[Muhammad]] and an older brother of [[Ali]].

==Early life==

Ja<U+2019>far was the third son of [[Abu Talib ibn Abdul Muttalib]] and [[Fatima bint Asad]], hence a cousin of Muhammad. His older brothers were Talib and Aqil; his younger brother was Ali; and his sisters were Fakhita, Jumana and Rayta.<ref>Muhammad ibn Saad, ''Tabaqat al-Kubra'' vol. 8. Translated by Bewley, A. (1995). ''The Women of Madina'', p. 156. London: Ta-Ha Publishers.</ref>

When there was a drought in [[Mecca]], Abu Talib could not afford to support his family. His brother [[<U+2018>Abbas ibn <U+2018>Abd al-Muttalib|Abbas]] therefore took charge of the young Ja<U+2019>far.<ref>Muhammad ibn Ishaq, ''Sirat Rasul Allah''. Translated by Guillaume, A. (1955). ''The Life of Muhammad'', p. 114. Oxford: Oxford University Press.</ref>

Ja<U+2019>far was an early convert to [[Islam]].<ref>Ibn Ishaq/Guillaume, p. 116.</ref> He married [[Asma bint Umays]], who converted to Islam in 614-615.<ref name="Saad-Bewley">Ibn Saad/Bewley vol. 8 p. 196. London: Ta-Ha Publishers.</ref>

==Flight to Abyssinia==
When the Muslims were harassed in Mecca, several of them migrated to [[Ethiopian Empire|Abyssinia]]. Ja<U+2019>far joined the [[Second migration to Abyssinia|second flight]] in 616.<ref>Ibn Ishaq/Guillaume p. 146.</ref> There they obtained the protection of the [[Negus]], [[Ashama ibn Abjar]], and could worship [[God in Islam|God]] unhindered.<ref>Ibn Ishaq/Guillaume pp. 148, 150.</ref>

Ja<U+2019>far and Asma lived in Abyssinia for about twelve years. Three sons were born to them there: [[Abdullah ibn Ja'far|Abdullah]], [[Muhammad ibn Ja'far|Muhammad]] and [[Awn ibn Ja'far|Awn]].<ref name="Saad-Bewley"/>

===The Quraysh Delegation===

The [[Quraysh tribe|Quraysh]], suspicious of their motives for leaving Arabia, sent Abdullah ibn Abi Rabiah and [['Amr ibn al-'As]] to negotiate with Negus to bring the emigrants back to Mecca. They gave presents of leather-goods to the Negus and his officials and gave him a bad report of the Muslims.<ref>Ibn Ishaq/Guillaume pp. 150-151.</ref> The Negus replied that he had promised protection to the Muslims and therefore could not hand them over without hearing their side of the story. When the Muslims were called to answer to the Negus, Ja<U+2019>far was their spokesman.<ref name="Ibn Ishaq/Guillaume p. 151">Ibn Ishaq/Guillaume p. 151.</ref>

The Negus asked them what was the religion for which they had forsaken their people, without entering into his religion or any other.<ref name="Ibn Ishaq/Guillaume p. 151"/>

Ja<U+2019>far replied: <U+201C>We were an uncivilised people. God sent us an apostle who commanded us to speak the truth, be faithful to our engagements, mindful of the ties of kinship and kindly hospitality, and to refrain from crimes and bloodshed. He forbade us to commit abominations and to speak lies, and to devour the property of orphans, to vilify chaste women. He commanded us to worship God alone and not to associate anything with Him, and he gave us orders about [[salat|prayer]], [[zakat|alms]] and fasting [enumerating the commands of Islam]. So we believed in him and what he brought to us from Allah; and we follow what he asked us to do and we avoid what he forbade us to do.<U+201D><ref>Ibn Ishaq/Guillaume pp. 151-152.</ref>

The Negus asked if Ja<U+2019>far had with him anything that Muhammad had received from God. Ja<U+2019>far recited for him the first portion of [[Maryam (sura)|''Surah'' Maryam]], which narrates the story of [[Jesus]] and his mother [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Mary]]. On hearing the words of the [[Quran]], <U+201C>the Negus wept until his beard was wet and the bishops wept until their scrolls were wet.<U+201D> The Negus said that he would never harm the Muslims.<ref name="Ibn Ishaq/Guillaume p. 152">Ibn Ishaq/Guillaume p. 152.</ref>

The two Quraysh delegates alleged that the Muslims called Jesus a created being, so the Negus asked Ja<U+2019>far what he thought of Jesus. Ja<U+2019>far answered: <U+201C>Our prophet says he is God<U+2019>s slave, apostle, spirit and word, which he cast into Mary the blessed virgin.<U+201D><ref name="Ibn Ishaq/Guillaume p. 152"/>

At this the Negus returned the gifts of the Quraysh, calling them <U+201C>bribes,<U+201D> and <U+201C>they left his presence crestfallen.<U+201D> The Muslims continued to live with the Negus <U+201C>comfortably in the best security.<U+201D><ref>Ibn Ishaq/Guillaume pp. 152-153.</ref>

===Overseas Preaching===

It is said that Ja<U+2019>far left Abyssinia to preach in other countries. He accompanied  [[Sa'd ibn Abi Waqqas]] and others in their mission to the Chittagong-Manipur-Tibet-Khotan-China region. The Muslims of the oasis-city of [[Hotan|Khotan]] (in the Xinjiang Province, six miles south of the Taklamakan Desert,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://archnet.org/library/places/one-place.jsp?place_id=9163&order_by=title&showdescription=1 |title=Khotan |publisher=Archnet.org |date=2004-12-03 |accessdate=2014-01-13}}</ref> west of Tibet) trace their origin to Ja<U+2019>far, a cousin of Muhammad.<ref>[http://archive.org/stream/preachingofislam00arno/preachingofislam00arno_djvu.txt/ Arnold, T. W. (1913). ''The Preaching of Islam: A History of the Propagation of the Muslim Faith, 2nd Ed.'', p. 296 f 3. London: Constable & Company Ltd.]</ref> Thereafter Ja<U+2019>far returned to Abyssinia.

Arnold claims that <U+201C>there is not the slightest historical base for this legend.<U+201D><ref>Arnold, p. 296.</ref>

==Return to Arabia==

In summer 628 the last of the Muslim immigrants departed from Abyssinia to join the Muslim community in [[Medina]]. Ja<U+2019>far and his family were among them.<ref>Ibn Ishaq/Guillaume p. 526.</ref>

On arriving at Medina, Ja<U+2019>far heard that Muhammad was in [[Khaybar]]. Ja<U+2019>far immediately set out to join the army and arrived just as Muhammad had won the [[Battle of Khaybar|battle]]. Muhammad greeted him with the words: <U+201C>I don<U+2019>t know which event makes me happier <U+2013> the arrival of Ja<U+2019>far or the conquest of Khaybar!<U+201D><ref>Waqidi, ''Kitab al-Maghazi''. Translated by Faizer, R., Ismail, A., & Tayob, A. (2011). ''The Life of Muhammad'' p. 336. Oxford: Routledge.</ref>

Ja<U+2019>far was famous for his acts of charity in Medina. [[Abu Hurairah]] recalled: <U+201C>The most generous of all the people to the poor was Ja<U+2019>far ibn Abi Talib. He used to take us to his home and offer us what was available therein. He would even offer us an empty folded leather container (of butter) which we would split and lick whatever was in it.<U+201D><ref>Bukhari 5:57:57.</ref>

==The Battle of Mu<U+2019>tah==
''Further information: [[Battle of Mu<U+2019>tah]].''

In September 629 Muhammad mobilized an army to confront Byzantine forces in Syria,<ref name="Ibn Ishaq/Guillaume p. 532">Ibn Ishaq/Guillaume p. 532.</ref> because a [[Byzantine]] governor had killed one of his emissaries.<ref name="Waqidi/Faizer p. 372">Waqidi/Faizer p. 372.</ref> He appointed [[Zayd ibn Harithah]] as commander of the army and instructed: <U+201C>If Zayd is wounded or killed, Ja<U+2019>far ibn Abu Talib will take over the command. If Ja<U+2019>far is killed or wounded, [[Abdullah ibn Rawahah]] will take his place. If Abdullah is killed, then let the Muslims appoint themselves a commander.<U+201D><ref name="Waqidi/Faizer p. 372"/>

The Muslims met the Byzantines at Muta,<ref name="Ibn Ishaq/Guillaume p. 534">Ibn Ishaq/Guillaume p. 534.</ref> where they were heavily outnumbered.<ref name="Ibn Ishaq/Guillaume p. 532"/> Zayd ibn Harithah was among the first Muslims to be killed in the battle, and Ja<U+2019>far then took over his standard and assumed command.<ref name="Ibn Ishaq/Guillaume p. 532"/> Mounted on his horse, he penetrated deep into the Byzantine ranks. As he spurred his horse on, he called out: <U+201C>How wonderful is Paradise as it draws near! How pleasant and cool is its drink! Punishment for the Byzantines is not far away!<U+201D>{{citation needed|date=January 2014}} Ja<U+2019>far fought until both his arms were cut off,{{citation needed|date=January 2014}} but he was eventually killed.<ref name="Ibn Ishaq/Guillaume p. 534"/> <U+201C>A Roman struck him and cut him in two halves. One half fell on the grape vine, and roughly thirty wounds were found on it.<U+201D> <U+201C>The body of Ja<U+2019>far held seventy-two scars between his shoulders, where he had been either struck by a sword or pierced by a spear.<U+201D><ref>Waqidi/Faizer p. 374.</ref>

==Death==

When the news reached Muhammad, he wept and prayed for Ja<U+2019>far<U+2019>s soul.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}} He later reported that the angel [[Gabriel]] came down to console him, saying: <U+201C>Jafar was a brave and loyal soldier. God has given him everlasting life, and in place of his arms which were cut off in the battle, the Lord has given him a pair of wings.<U+201D>{{citation needed|date=January 2014}} Thereafter Ja<U+2019>far had the byname ''Zul Janaheen'' (<U+201C>the Winged<U+201D>).<ref>Ibn Ishaq/Guillaume p. 234.</ref>

Ja<U+2019>far<U+2019>s widow Asma recalled: <U+201C>God<U+2019>s Messenger came to me and asked, <U+2018>Where are Jafar<U+2019>s children?<U+2019> I brought them to him and he embraced them and smelled them, then his eyes welled up and he cried. <U+2018>O God<U+2019>s Messenger,<U+2019> I asked, <U+2018>Have you heard something about Jafar?<U+2019> <U+2018>Yes,<U+2019> he replied. <U+2018>He was killed today.<U+2019> I stood up and screamed, and the women came to me. The Prophet began to say, <U+2018>O Asma, do not speak obscene words or beat your chest!<U+2019><U+201D> Her son Abdullah remembered: <U+201C>He said, <U+2018>O Asma, will you not rejoice? Indeed, God most high has made two wings for Ja<U+2019>far, that he may fly with them in Paradise!<U+2019><U+201D> Then Muhammad told his daughter Fatima, <U+201C>Prepare food for the family of Ja<U+2019>far, for they are preoccupied today.<U+201D><ref>Waqidi/Faizer p. 377.</ref>

Ja<U+2019>far<U+2019>s tomb is located in Al-Mazar, near [[Al Karak|Kerak]], Jordan. It is enclosed in an ornate shrine of gold and silver made by the [[Dawoodi Bohra]]<U+2019>s 52nd Da<U+2019>i, [[Mohammed Burhanuddin]].{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}
