Under the guidance of [[Columbia Records]] executive [[Tommy Mottola]], Carey released her self-titled debut [[studio album]] ''[[Mariah Carey (album)|Mariah Carey]]'' in 1990; it went multi-platinum and spawned four consecutive number one singles on the U.S. [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] chart. Following her marriage to Mottola in 1993 and success with hit records ''[[Emotions (Mariah Carey album)|Emotions]]'' (1991), ''[[Music Box (Mariah Carey album)|Music Box]]'' (1993), and ''[[Merry Christmas (Mariah Carey album)|Merry Christmas]]'' (1994), Carey was established as Columbia's highest-selling act. ''[[Daydream (Mariah Carey album)|Daydream]]'' (1995) made music history when its second single "[[One Sweet Day]]", a duet with [[Boyz II Men]], spent a record sixteen weeks on top of the ''Billboard'' Hot 100, and remains the [[List of Billboard Hot 100 chart achievements and milestones|longest-running number-one song in U.S. chart history]]. During the recording of the album, Carey began to deviate from her R&B and pop beginnings and slowly traversed into hip hop. This musical change became evident with the release of ''[[Butterfly (Mariah Carey album)|Butterfly]]'' (1997), at which time Carey had separated from Mottola.

Carey left Columbia in 2000, and signed a $100&nbsp;million recording contract with [[Virgin Records]]. Before the release of her first feature film ''[[Glitter (film)|Glitter]]'' (2001), she suffered a physical and emotional breakdown and was hospitalized for severe exhaustion. Following the film's poor reception, she was bought out of her recording contract for $50 million, which led to a decline in her career. She signed a multi-million dollar contract deal with [[Island Records]] in 2002, and after an unsuccessful period, returned to the top of music charts with ''[[The Emancipation of Mimi]]'' (2005). Its second single "[[We Belong Together]]" became her most successful single of the 2000s, and was later named "Song of the Decade" by ''[[Billboard magazine|Billboard]]''. Carey once again ventured into film with a well-received supporting role in ''[[Precious (film)|Precious]]'' (2009); she was awarded the "Breakthrough Performance Award" at the [[Palm Springs International Film Festival]], and [[Black Reel Awards of 2010|Black Reel]] and [[NAACP Image Award]] nominations.

In a career spanning over two decades, Carey has sold more than 200 million records worldwide, making her one of the [[List of best-selling music artists|best-selling music artists]] of all time. In 1998, she was honored as the world's best-selling recording artist of the 1990s at the [[World Music Awards]]. Carey was also named the best-selling female artist of the millennium in 2000. According to the [[Recording Industry Association of America]], she is the third [[List of best-selling music artists in the United States|best-selling female artist]] in the United States, with 63.5&nbsp;million [[RIAA certification|certified]] albums. With the release of "[[Touch My Body]]" (2008), Carey gained her eighteenth number one single in the United States, more than any other solo artist. In 2012, Carey was ranked second on [[VH1]]'s list of the "100 Greatest Women in Music". Aside from her commercial accomplishments, Carey has won five [[Grammy Award]]s, 17 World Music Awards, 11 [[American Music Award]]s, and 31 [[Billboard Music Award]]s. Referred to as the "songbird supreme" by the ''[[Guinness World Records]]'', she is famed for her five-octave [[vocal range]], [[Belting (music)|power]], [[melisma]]tic style and signature use of the [[whistle register]].

==Life and career==

===1970<U+2013>87: Early life and struggles===
Mariah Carey was born on [[Long Island]], in [[Huntington, New York]].<ref>{{cite news | url = http://www.newsday.com/entertainment/fanfare/li-music-hall-of-fame-recognizes-local-talent-1.884107 | title = LI Music Hall of Fame recognizes local talent | date = October 22, 2008 | first = Glenn | last= Gamboa | work = [[Newsday]] | location = [[New York City]] / [[Long Island]] |  quote = Born in Huntington, raised in Greenlawn.}}</ref><ref name="nick1" /> Her father, Alfred Roy, was of [[African American]] and [[Venezuelan people|Venezuelan]] (including Afro-Venezuelan) descent, while her mother, Patricia (n<U+00E9>e Hickey), is of white [[Irish American|Irish]] descent. The last name Carey was the product of a name-change by her Venezuelan grandfather, Francisco Nu<U+00F1>ez, after emigrating to New York.<ref name="nick2">{{harvnb|Nickson|1998|pp=7}}</ref> Patricia's father died while she was young; however, she inherited his passion for music.<ref name="nick2"/> She developed a career as an occasional opera singer and vocal coach, and met Alfred in 1960.<ref name="nick1">{{harvnb|Nickson|1998|pp=8}}</ref> As he began earning a living as an aeronautical engineer, the couple wed later that year, and moved into a small suburb in New York.<ref name="nick2"/> After the pair's elopement, Patricia's family disowned her, due to marrying a man of color. Carey later explained that growing up, she felt a notion of neglect from her maternal family, a mark that affected her greatly: "So later I was like, 'Well, where does this leave me? Am I a bad person?' You know. It's still not that common to be a multi-racial person, but I'm happy with the combination of things that I am."<ref name="nick2"/> During the interval of years in between Carey's older sister Alison and the singer's birth, the Carey family experienced personal struggles within the community due to their ethnicity.<ref name="nick2"/> Carey's name was derived from the song "[[They Call the Wind Maria]]", originally from the 1951 Broadway musical ''[[Paint Your Wagon (musical)|Paint Your Wagon]].''<ref>{{cite news|url=http://movies.nytimes.com/person/10883/Mariah-Carey|title=Mariah Carey Biography|work=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=August 14, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.people.com/people/mariah_carey|title=Celebrity Central: Top 25 Celebrities: Mariah Carey|work=[[People (magazine)|People]]|accessdate=August 14, 2011}}</ref> When Carey was three years old, her parents divorced due to the increasingly strenuous nature of their marriage.<ref name="nick3">{{harvnb|Nickson|1998|pp=9}}</ref>

{{Quote box|width=300px|align=left|quote="It's been difficult for me, moving around so much, having to grow up by myself... my parents divorced. And I always felt kind of different from everybody else in my neighborhoods. I was a different person ethnically. And sometimes, that can be a problem.

After their separation, Alison moved in with her father, while the other two children remained with their mother.<ref name="nick3"/> As the years passed, Carey would grow apart from her father, and would later stop seeing him altogether.<ref name="nick3"/><ref name="nick4">{{harvnb|Nickson|1998|pp=10<U+2013>11}}</ref> By the age of four, Carey recalled that she had begun to sneak the radio under her covers at night, and just sing from her heart, and try and find peace within the music.<ref name="nick4"/> During elementary school, she would excel in subjects that she enjoyed, such as literature, art and music, while not finding interest in other subjects.<ref name="nick5">{{harvnb|Nickson|1998|pp=13}}</ref> After several years of financial struggles, Patricia earned enough money to move her family into a stable and more affluent sector in New York.<ref name="nick5"/> Carey had begun writing poems and adding melodies to them, thus starting as a [[singer-songwriter]] while attending [[Harborfields High School]] in Greenlawn, New York.<ref name="nick7">{{harvnb|Nickson|1998|pp=16}}</ref> Even from a young age, Carey excelled in her music, and demonstrated usage of the [[whistle register]], though only beginning to master and control it through her training with her mother.<ref name="nick7"/> Though introducing her daughter to the world of classical opera, Patricia never pressured Carey to pursue a career in the genre, as she never seemed interested in that world of music.<ref name="nick7"/> Carey recalled that she kept her singer-songwriter works a secret and noted that Patricia had "never been a pushy mom. She never said, 'Give it more of an operatic feel'. I respect opera like crazy, but it didn't influence me."<ref name="nick7"/><ref name="nick8">{{harvnb|Nickson|1998|pp=17}}</ref>

While a high school student, Carey developed a relationship with Gavin Christopher, with whom she shared musical aspirations. The songwriting duo needed an assistant who could play the [[Musical keyboard|keyboard]]: "We called someone and he couldn't come, so by accident we stumbled upon [[Ben Margulies|Ben]] [Margulies]. Ben came to the studio, and he really couldn't play the keyboards very well <U+2014> he was really more of a drummer <U+2014> but after that day, we kept in touch, and we sort of clicked as writers."<ref name="nick8"/> Carey and Christopher began writing and composing songs in the basement of his father's store during Carey's [[Senior (education)|senior year]]. After composing their first song together, "Here We Go Round Again", which Carey described as having a [[Motown]]-vibe, they continued writing material for a full-length demo.<ref name="nick9">{{harvnb|Nickson|1998|pp=18}}</ref> She began living in a one-bedroom apartment in Manhattan, which she shared with four other female students.<ref name="nick10">{{harvnb|Nickson|1998|pp=19}}</ref><ref name="nick11">{{harvnb|Nickson|1998|pp=20}}</ref> During this time, Carey worked as a waitress for various restaurants, usually getting fired after two-week intervals.<ref name="nick12">{{harvnb|Nickson|1998|pp=21}}</ref> While requiring work to pay for her rent, Carey's mind and effort still remained with her musical ambitions, as she continued working late into the night with Margulies, in hopes of completing a demo that could be passed on to [[Music executive|record executives]].<ref name="nick12"/> After completing her four song demo tape, Carey attempted to pass it to music labels, but was met with failure each time.<ref name="nick13">{{harvnb|Nickson|1998|pp=22}}</ref> Shortly thereafter, she was introduced to rising [[Pop music|pop]] singer [[Brenda K.

Love is the subject of the majority of Carey's lyrics, although she has written about themes such as racism, [[social alienation]], death, [[Malnutrition|world hunger]], and [[spirituality]]. She has said that much of her work is partly autobiographical, but ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine wrote: "If only Mariah Carey's music had the drama of her life. Her songs are often sugary and artificial<U+2014>[[NutraSweet]] soul. But her life has passion and conflict," applying it to the first stages of her career.

Carey has said that from childhood she has been influenced by [[Billie Holiday]], [[Sarah Vaughan]], and R&B and soul musicians such as [[Gladys Knight]] and [[Aretha Franklin]].<ref name=black>{{cite web|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=xcwDAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA54&dq=Mariah+Carey:+'Not+another+White+girl+trying+to+sing+Black&hl=en&ei=AZZPTpG9Do6CtgfGnNSsBw&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CCoQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=Mariah%20Carey%3A%20'Not%20another%20White%20girl%20trying%20to%20sing%20Black&f=false|title=Not Another White Girl Trying to Sing Black|last=Norent|first=Lynn|work=Ebony|date=March 12, 1991|accessdate=August 19, 2011}}</ref> Her music contains strong influences of [[gospel music]], and she credits [[The Clark Sisters]], [[Shirley Caesar]] and [[Edwin Hawkins]] as the most influential in her early years.<ref name=black/> When Carey incorporated hip-hop into her sound, speculation arose that she was making an attempt to take advantage of the genre's popularity, but she told ''[[Newsweek]]'', "People just don't understand. I grew up with this music".{{sfn|Shapiro|2001|p=124}} She has expressed appreciation for rappers such as [[The Sugarhill Gang]], [[Eric B. & Rakim]], the [[Wu-Tang Clan]], [[The Notorious B.I.G.]] and [[Mobb Deep]], with whom she collaborated on the single "[[The Roof (Back in Time)]]" (1998).<ref name=vinsky/> Carey was heavily influenced by [[Minnie Riperton]], and began experimenting with the whistle register due to her original practice of the range.<ref name=vinsky/>

During Carey's career, her vocal and musical style, along with her level of success, has been compared to [[Whitney Houston]], who she has also cited as an influence,<ref name=FOX>{{Cite news| first= Roger | last= Friedman | title= Mariah Calls, Whitney Falls |date=December 18, 2002| publisher= Fox News Channel | url= http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,73318,00.html|accessdate=April 25, 2009 }}</ref> and [[Celine Dion]].
