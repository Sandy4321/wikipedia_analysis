The '''Greeks''' ([[Greek language|Greek]]: <U+0388><U+03BB><U+03BB><U+03B7><U+03BD><U+03B5><U+03C2> [{{IPA|<U+02C8>elines}}]) are a [[nation]] and [[ethnic group]] defined by a common [[Greek language|language]] and culture who populate [[Greece]] and nearby regions of the [[Balkan peninsula]] and [[Cyprus]]. Additionally, there are significant Greek populations throughout various countries due to the [[Greek diaspora]].<ref name=Roberts1/> 

Greek colonies and communities have been historically established in most corners of the [[Mediterranean sea|Mediterranean]] but Greeks have always been centered around the [[Aegean sea|Aegean coasts]], where Greek has been spoken since antiquity.<ref name=BritTheGreeks/> Until the early 20th century Greeks were uniformly distributed between the Greek peninsula, the western coast of [[Asia Minor]], [[Pontus]], [[Cyprus]] and [[Constantinople]], regions which coincided to a large extent with the borders of the [[Byzantine Empire]] of the late [[11th century]] and the Eastern Mediterranean areas of ancient [[Greek colonies|Greek colonization]].<ref>R. Beaton, ''The Medieval Greek Romance'',1996,Routledge, ISBN 0415120322</ref> In the aftermath of the [[Greco-Turkish War (1919-1922)]] in 1923, a large-scale population exchange between Greece and Turkey transferred and confined ethnic Greeks almost entirely into the borders of the modern Greek state and Cyprus. Other ethnic Greek populations can be found from [[Southern Italy]] to the [[Caucasus]] and in [[Greek diaspora|diaspora]] communities in a number of other countries. Today, the vast majority of Greeks (>99%) are at least nominally adherents of [[Greek Orthodox Church|Greek Orthodoxy]].<ref>{{cite web |work=Encarta |url=http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761572872_3/Greece.html |title=Greece}}</ref><ref name=CIA/>


==History==
{{Greek people}}

Greek has been spoken in the Greek peninsula (i.e. the southern [[Balkans|Balkan region]]) for over 3,500 years and in western Asia Minor for a little less.<ref>[[World Book]] 2005, "Greece"</ref> It has an almost unbroken literary history which makes it one of the oldest surviving branches of the [[Indo-European languages]]. From [[Ancient Greece]] the Greeks have inherited a sophisticated culture and language documented over three millennia.<ref name="Browning"/>

[[Greece]] was the first modern state to be created in the Balkans when the Greeks liberated a part of their historic homelands from the [[Ottoman Empire]]. The large Greek Diaspora and merchant class were instrumental in transmitting the ideas of western [[Romantic nationalism]] and [[Philhellenism]]. These, together with the conception of Hellenism formulated during the last centuries of the Eastern Roman Empire, formed the basis of the [[Greek Enlightenment]]. <ref name=Mazower/>

===Mycenaean===
{{see|Mycenaean Greece}}
The proto-Greeks arrived in the area now referred to as 'Greece' (the southern tip of the Balkan peninsula) at the end of the third millennium BC. There they mingled with the native pre-Hellenic populations and by the [[16th century BC]] this fusion had created the civilization we call Mycenaean today.<ref name=BritGreeks>Encyclopedia Britannica, ''The Greeks'', 2008, O.Ed.</ref> The Mycenaeans were the first Greek speaking people, as attested by the [[Iliad]] and [[Odyssey]] and later the deciphering of their [[Linear B]] script. The language behind the script was found to be an early form of Greek.<ref>Encyclopaedia Britannica,''Mycenaean language'', 2008, O.Ed.</ref> 

The Mycenaeans quickly penetrated the [[Aegean civilization|Aegean]] and by the 15th century BC had reached Rhodes, Crete, Cyprus and the shores of [[Asia Minor]]. From 1,200 BC the [[Dorians]], another Greek speaking people, followed from [[Epirus]]. The Dorian Migration was followed by a poorly attested period of migrations, appropriately called the [[Greek Dark Ages]], but by 800 BC the landscape of Classical Greece was discernible.

There are some elements of cultural continuity between the Greek Dark Ages or Early Iron Age (1100 BC - 750 BC), and the Archaic and [[Classical Greece]] (750 BC onwards) of the [[Polis]]. In the Odyssey and the Iliad, the Greeks of [[Prehistory]] are viewed as the forefathers of the early classical civilization of Homer's own time.<ref>Podzuweit, Christian (1982). "Die mykenische Welt und [[Troy|Troja]]". In: B. H<U+00E4>nsel (ed.), ''S<U+00FC>dosteuropa zwischen 1600 und 1000 v. Chr.'', 65<U+2013>88</ref> [[Achilles]] and [[Odysseus]] were viewed by Greeks as prime-examples of the ideal citizen of a Polis.

The Mycenaean pantheon included many of the divinities attested in later [[Greek religion]] including [[Zeus]], [[Poseidon]], [[Athena]], [[Artemis]],  [[Ares]]-"Enyalios", [[Hermes]], [[Dionysus]] and Eilithyia. It was also influenced by the [[Minoan religion|Minoan pantheon]]. There was some continuity of religion and cult from the [[Late Bronze Age]] into later Greek times.<ref>Encyclopedia Britannica, ''Aegean civilizations, Religion'', 2008, O.Ed.</ref>

===Classical===
{{Main|Ancient Greece}}
{{see|Ancient Greek dialects|Greek tribes}}

The [[classical antiquity|classical]] period of Greek civilization covers a time span from the early fifth century BC to the death of [[Alexander the Great]], in 323 BC. It is so named because it set the standards by which Greek civilization would be judged in later eras. In that time Greeks contributed to the future development of arts and sciences by creating a legacy of influence upon Western civilization.<ref>Encyclopedia Britannica, ''ancient Greek civilization'', 2008, O.Ed.</ref> The ethnogenessis of the Greek nation is marked by the first Olympic Games in 776 BC when the idea of a common Hellenism amongst the Greek speaking tribes was first translated into a shared cultural experience.<ref name=Roberts1/> Hellenism was supremely a matter of common culture. <ref name=Roberts1>J.M.Roberts, ''The New Penguin History of the World, The Greeks,'' Fifth Edition, 2007, p.p.171-172, ISBN 9780141030425</ref>

[[Herodotus]] writes that the Athenians declared, before the [[battle of Plataea]], that they would not go over to [[Mardonius]], because in the first place, they were bound to avenge the burning of the [[Acropolis]]; and, secondly, they would not betray their fellow Greeks, to whom 
they were bound by:<ref>[[Herodotus]], ''[[Histories (Herodotus)|Histories]]'', 8, 144, quote:''<U+03C4><U+1F78> <U+1F19><U+03BB><U+03BB><U+03B7><U+03BD><U+03B9><U+03BA><U+03CC><U+03BD>, <U+1F10><U+1F78><U+03BD> <U+1F45><U+03BC><U+03B1><U+03B9><U+03BC><U+03CC><U+03BD> <U+03C4><U+03B5> <U+03BA><U+03B1><U+1F76> <U+1F41><U+03BC><U+03CC><U+03B3><U+03BB><U+03C9><U+03C3><U+03C3><U+03BF><U+03BD>, <U+03BA><U+03B1><U+1F76> <U+03B8><U+03B5><U+1FF6><U+03BD> <U+1F31><U+03B4><U+03C1><U+03CD><U+03BC><U+03B1><U+03C4><U+03AC> <U+03C4><U+03B5> <U+03BA><U+03BF><U+03B9><U+03BD><U+1F70> <U+03BA><U+03B1><U+1F76> <U+03B8><U+03C5><U+03C3><U+03AF><U+03B1><U+03B9> <U+1F24><U+03B8><U+03B5><U+03AC> <U+03C4><U+03B5> <U+1F41><U+03BC><U+03CC><U+03C4><U+03C1><U+03BF><U+03C0><U+03B1>''</ref>

* Common [[shrine]]s, [[statue]]s and [[sacrifice]]s (practice of the [[ancient Greek religion]]) 
* Common habits and customs.

As [[Thucydides]] observes the name of Hellas spread from a valley in [[Thessaly]] to the Greek-speaking populations sometime after the compositions of [[Homer]] (the ''Panellenes'' of Iliad 2.530 are the troops of Thessaly,<ref>Homer, ''Iliad'', 2.530</ref> contrasting with the [[Achaeans]]) and not long before his own time.<ref>Thucydides, ''Histories'', I, 132</ref> Hellen, combined into one group the smaller tribes that participated 
in the [[Amphictyonic League|Delphic Amphictyon]], such as the [[Aeolians]], the Achaeans, and the Dorians.<ref>Encyclopedia Britannica, ''Hellen'', 2008, O.Ed.</ref>

As early as the 5th century BC, [[Isocrates]], after speaking of common origin and religion, says: "the name Hellenes suggests no longer a race but a culture and education,... the title Hellenes is applied best to those who share our culture rather than to those who share our common blood".<ref>[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus:text:1999.01.0144:speech=4:section=50 Isocrates,''Panegyric'' 4.50]</ref> Following  Alexander the Great's conquests, Greek became the ''[[lingua franca]]'' of the Eastern Mediterranean and was widely spoken by educated non-Greeks.
[[Image:Thebeskouros.jpg|thumb|right|150px|[[Kouros]],Archaic period]]
However, while the Greeks of the Classical era understood themselves to belong to a common Greek ethnicity their first loyalty was to their [[city-state|city]] and they saw nothing incongruous about warring, often brutally, with other Greek [[Polis]]'. The [[Peloponnesian War]], a large scale Greek "civil" war between Athens and Sparta and their allies, is a notable such incident which highlights the lack of a common national (as opposed to ethnic) identity among Greeks. This local patriotism, (''topikismos'') remains a part of Greek culture.<ref name=BritMerchant>Encyclopedia Britannica, ''history of Greece, Ottoman Empire, The merchant middle class'', 2008, O.Ed.</ref>

The feuding Greek city states were only united under the banner of Alexander the Great's Panhellenic ideals, though some might contend that [[Macedon]]<U+2019>s overwhelming military strength might have played a role. Regardless, the combined armies of Greece were pointed at the Greek's nemesis, the Persian Empire.<ref name=ColAlex>The Columbia Encyclopedia, ''Alexander the Great'', Sixth Edition, 2001-07, O.Ed.</ref> Following victories at the battles of [[Battle of Granicus|Granicus]], [[Battle of Issus|Issus]] and [[Battle of Gaugamela|Gaugamela]] the Greeks toppled the world's largest empire. Greek armies advanced as far as modern day India and Tajikistan, setting up colonies and trade routes along the way. While the empire created did not survive Alexander<U+2019>s death, the cultural implications of the spread of Hellenism across most of the known world were to prove long lived.  Two thousand years later there are still communities like the [[Kalash]] in Pakistan and the [[Nuristani]] in Afghanistan who claim to be descended from Greek settlers.<ref name=ColAlex/><ref>Michael Wood, ''In the Footsteps of Alexander The Great: A Journey from Greece to Asia'', 2001, University of California Press, p.8, ISBN 0520231929</ref>

===Hellenistic===
{{see|Hellenistic civilization}}
[[Image:Cleopatra Bust.jpg|thumb|right|150px|[[Bust]] of the queen [[Cleopatra VII|Cleopatra Thea Philopator]] [[Ptolemaic Egypt|of Egypt]]]]
When [[Alexander the Great]]'s armies overthrew the [[Persian Empire]] and spread Greek culture from the Adriatic to the Indian Ocean they were laying the foundations for a new era. The beginning of the [[Hellenistic civilization|Hellenistic age]] is usually placed at Alexander's death. This Hellenistic age, so called because it witnessed the partial [[hellenization]] of many non-Greek cultures and a combination of Greek, Middle Eastern and Indian elements, lasted until the conquest of [[Ptolemaic Egypt|Egypt]] by Rome in 30 BC.

This age saw the Greeks move towards larger cities and a reduction in the importance of the city-state. These larger cities were parts of the still larger [[Diadochi|Kingdoms of the Diadochi]]. Greeks however remained aware of their past, chiefly through the study of the works of Homer and the Classical authors.<ref>Michael Grant,  ''The Hellenistic Greeks: From Alexander to Cleopatra'', 1990, ISBN 0297820575</ref> An important factor in maintaining Greek identity was contact with ''[[barbarian]]'' (non-Greek) peoples which was deepened in the new cosmopolitan environment of the multi ethnic Hellenistic Kingdoms. This led to a strong desire among Greeks to organize the transmission of Hellenic ''[[paideia]]'' to the next generation.<ref>William Vernon Harris, ''Ancient Literacy'', 1989, p.136, ISBN 0674033817</ref>

In the religious sphere, this was a period of profound change. The spiritual revolution that took place saw a waning of the old Greek religion, whose decline beginning in the 3rd century BC continued with the introduction of new religious movements from the East.<ref name=Robers2>J.M.Roberts, ''The New Penguin History of the World, The Hellenistic World'', Fifth Ed., 2007, p.222, ISBN 9780141030425</ref> The cults of deities like [[Isis]] and [[Mithra]] were introduced into the Greek world.<ref name=BritHelRel>Encyclopedia Britannica, Hellenistic age, Hellenistic religion, 2008, O.Ed.</ref> In the [[Indo-Greek]] kingdoms of the East and the [[Greco-Bactrian]] a new Hellenized form of a local religion was spreading, [[Greco-Buddhism]] and Greco-Buddhist missionaries would play an important role in propagating it to China.<ref>Richard C.

The new Eastern Religions introduced into the Greek world paved the way for the expansion of Christianity among Roman era Greeks. [[Early Christianity]] was profoundly shaped by the Greek world of ideas and the Greek speaking Christians (the so called ''<U+03B5><U+03BE> <U+03B5><U+03BB><U+03BB><U+03AE><U+03BD><U+03C9><U+03BD> <U+03C7><U+03C1><U+03B9><U+03C3><U+03C4><U+03B9><U+03B1><U+03BD><U+03BF><U+03AF>'' or ''Hellenists'') formed the majority of the [[Early Church]] and provided most of the [[Greek Fathers]].<ref name=BritHelRel/> Eventually the word ''Hellene'' came to mean a Hellenic polytheist or a pagan in general and Greek speakers referred to themselves as [[Rhomaioi]] (Romans in Greek, an ethnonym still in use today). Distinctions of ethnicity still existed in the [[Roman empire]], but became secondary to religious considerations. The renewed empire used Christianity as a tool to maintain its cohesion and promoted a robust Roman national identity. <ref>Anthony Kaldellis , ''Hellenism in Byzantium The Transformations of Greek Identity and the Reception of the Classical Tradition'', Cambridge University Press, 2008, ISBN 9780521876889</ref>

The [[Eastern Roman Empire]] (which was later misnamed by Western historians as the Byzantine Empire, a name that would have meant nothing to Greek speakers of the era)<ref name=BritByz>Encyclopedia Britannica, ''Byzantine Empire, Introduction'', 2008, O.Ed.</ref> was dominated by Greek culture to such an extent that Emperor [[Heraclius]] (575 CE - 641 CE) finally decided to make Greek the Roman Empire's official language. <ref name=BritTheGreeks>Encyclopedia Britannica, ''The Greeks'', 2008, O.Ed.</ref> From then on, the Roman and Greek cultures were virtually fused in the East into a single [[Greco-Roman]] world.

A distinct Greek nationalism re-emerged in the 11th century within specific circles and became more forceful after the fall of Constantinople to the Crusaders of the [[Fourth Crusade]] in 1204, and the establishment of a number of Greek kingdoms (such as the [[Empire of Nicaea]] and the [[Despotate of Epirus]]).<ref name=BritIdent/> When the empire was revived in 1261, it became in many ways a Greek national state. Adherence to [[Greek Orthodox]] rites and the Greek language, became the defining characteristic of its people. That new notion of nationhood engendered a deep interest in the classical past. There was a powerful secularist tradition in this, culminating in the ideas of the Neo-Platonist Byzantine philosopher [[George Gemistus Plethon]] who wished to revive the ancient Greek religion. However it was the combination of Orthodoxy with a specifically Greek identity that shaped the Byzantine Greeks notions of themselves in the empire's twilight years.<ref name=BritIdent>Encyclopedia Britannica, ''Greece during the Byzantine period (c.

Under the Ottoman Empire's [[millet system]], religion was the defining characteristic of "national" groups (''milletler''), so the [[exonym]] "Greeks" (''Rumlar'' from the name Rhomaioi) was applied by the Ottomans to all members of the [[Orthodox Church]], regardless of their language or ethnic origin. Conversely, those who adopted [[Islam]] during that period were considered part of the same Muslim millet, regardless of their language or origin.<ref name=Mazower/> The [[Greek language|Greek]] speakers were the only ethnic group to actually call themselves [[Rhomaioi]], (as opposed to being so named by others) and some even considered their ethnicity (''genos'') to be Hellenic.<ref>Mavrocordatos Nicholaos, ''Philotheou Parerga'', J.Bouchard, 1989, p.178, quote: ''<U+0393><U+03AD><U+03BD><U+03BF><U+03C2> <U+03BC><U+03B5><U+03BD> <U+03B7><U+03BC><U+03AF><U+03BD> <U+03C4><U+03C9><U+03BD> <U+03AC><U+03B3><U+03B1><U+03BD> <U+0395><U+03BB><U+03BB><U+03AE><U+03BD><U+03C9><U+03BD>''</ref> For most [[Greek language|Greek]] speakers however the Hellenes were an ancient, semi-mythical race of giants to whom they were inferior in strength and achievement. <ref>I.Th.Kakridis,''<U+039F><U+03B9> <U+03B1><U+03C1><U+03C7><U+03B1><U+03AF><U+03BF><U+03B9> <U+0388><U+03BB><U+03BB><U+03B7><U+03BD><U+03B5><U+03C2> <U+03C3><U+03C4><U+03B7><U+03BD> <U+03BD><U+03B5><U+03BF><U+03B5><U+03BB><U+03BB><U+03B7><U+03BD><U+03B9><U+03BA><U+03AE> <U+03BB><U+03B1><U+03B9><U+03BA><U+03AE> <U+03C0><U+03B1><U+03C1><U+03AC><U+03B4><U+03BF><U+03C3><U+03B7>'' or ''The Ancient Greeks in Modern Greek popular tradition'', Greek National Bank Editions, 1989 (reprint of early 20th c. work)</ref>

The roots of Greek success in the [[Ottoman Empire]] can be traced to the Greek tradition of education and the need of the Ottomans for skilled and educated negotiators as the power of their empire declined and they were compelled to rely on treaties more than force of arms.<ref name=BritB>Encyclopedia Britannica,''Phanariotes'',  2008, O.Ed.</ref> However it was the wealth of the extensive Greek merchant class that provided the material basis for the intellectual revival that was the prominent feature of Greek life in the half century and more leading to the outbreak of the [[Greek War of Independence]] in 1821. Impelled by the brand of local patriotism that has always been of feature of the Greek world they endowed libraries and schools. Not coincidentally, on the eve of 1821 the three most important centres of Greek learning, schools-cum-universities, were situated in [[Chios]], [[Smyrna]] and [[Aivali]], all three major centres of Greek commerce.<ref name=BritannicaB>Encyclopedia Britannica, ''Greek history, The mercantile middle class'', 2008 ed. </ref> Starting in the 15th century many Greeks sought better employment and education opportunities by leaving for the [[Western World|West]], particularly [[Renaissance Italy|Italy]] but also Central Europe and [[Greeks in Germany|Germany]] as well as [[Greeks in Russia|Russia]].

This relationship between ethnic Greek identity and Greek Orthodox religion continued after the creation of the modern Greek state in 1830. According to the second article of the first [[Greek constitution]] of 1822 a Greek was defined as any Christian resident of the Kingdom of Greece, a clause removed by 1840.<ref>[http://www.verfassungen.de/griech/verf22.htm Text of the 1822 Epidaurus Constitution], (in German)</ref> A century later, when the [[Treaty of Lausanne]] was signed between Greece and Turkey in 1923, the two countries agreed to use religion as the determinant for ethnic identity for the purposes of population exchange.<ref>Clark, Bruce, ''Twice A Stranger: How Mass Expulsion Forged Modern Greece and Turkey'', 2006, London: Granta, ISBN 1-86207-752-5.</ref>  

While the majority of Greeks today are descended from Greek speaking [[Rhomioi]] there are sizeable groups of ethnic Greeks who trace their descent to [[Aromanian language|Aromanian-speaking]] [[Vlachs]], [[Arvanitika|Albanian-speaking]] [[Arvanites]] and [[Slavophone Greeks|Slavic-speaking Greeks]].<ref>[http://www.eens-congress.eu/?main__page=1&main__lang=de&eensCongress_cmd=showPaper&eensCongress_id=86 Peter Mackridge Hellenes equals Rhomioi and Aromanians and Arberesh] (in Greek)</ref> None of the latter groups were ever considered less Greek than the [[Rhomioi]] and their contribution to the liberation and foundation of the modern Greek state was decisive.<ref>M.

In many important respects, the Greek state adhered from its founding to remarkably [[secular]] principles. For instance, Jews were granted full citizens rights in 1830, the year Greece's independence was formally recognized, thus making Greece one of the first states in Europe with an [[Jewish emancipation|emancipated Jewish]] community.

Today, the deeper integration of Greece into the Western strategic system and the effects of migration (both emigration from Greece in the 1950s and 1960s, and immigration into Greece in more recent years) have led to a perception of [[multiculturalism]] similar to that of Western European nations.

The terms used to define Greekness have varied throughout history. By Western standards, the term ''Greeks'' has traditionally referred to any native speakers of the Greek language, whether [[Mycenaean language|Mycenaean]], [[Medieval Greek|Byzantine]] or modern Greek. While Byzantine Greeks called themselves Rhomioi, they valued the classical tradition, considered themselves the political heirs of [[Roman Empire|Rome]], and deemed themselves the ethnic, cultural, and literary heirs of ancient Greece.<ref name=Mango>Mango, Cyril, ''The Oxford History of Byzantium'',2002, p. 5, Oxford University Press, ISBN 0198140983</ref> The use of the older self-descriptive ethnic term ''Hellenes'' begun to be revived during the era following the Greco-Latin clashes between the Greeks and the Western [[Crusades|Crusaders]] in the [[12th century]]. It regained some popularity through its use by late [[List of Byzantine Emperors|Byzantine Emperors]] and scholars such as [[Gemistus Pletho]] and [[Ciriaco Pizzicolli]].<ref name=BritIdent/> It became fairly common with the emergence, in the late [[18th century]], of the nation-state and its gradual consolidation, but it was not until the early [[19th century]] that its popular use was firmly re-established.<ref name=Mazower>Mazower, Mark, ''The Balkans: A short history'',2002, Modern Library, ISBN 081296621X</ref>

The Greeks today are a nation in the meaning of an [[ethnic group|''ethnos'']] (<U+03AD><U+03B8><U+03BD><U+03BF><U+03C2> in Greek), defined by possessing [[Culture of Greece|Greek culture]], and having a Greek [[First language|mother tongue]], rather than by citizenship, race, religion or by being subjects of any particular state. However, Greeks are also identified as a ''[[genos]]'' (<U+03B3><U+03AD><U+03BD><U+03BF><U+03C2> in Greek) in the sense that most share a common ancestry. The term ''Greek'' also referred to the [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox Christian]] inhabitants of the Rum Millet of the Ottoman Empire.<ref name=Mazower/>

[[Image:Funerary stele.jpg|thumb|300px|Family group on a [[funerary stele]] from Athens, National Archaeological Museum, Athens]]

Throughout the centuries, the Greeks have been known by a number of names, including:
*'''Hellenes''' (<U+0388><U+03BB><U+03BB><U+03B7><U+03BD><U+03B5><U+03C2>) - In mythology, [[Hellen]], son of [[Deucalion]] and [[Pyrrha]] (the Greek equivalents of Adam and Eve and Noah), received from the nymph [[Orseis]] three sons, [[Aeolus]], [[Dorus]] and [[Xuthus]]. Aeolus and Dorus, and two sons of Xuthus, [[Achaeus, son of Xuthus|Achaeus]] and [[Ionas|Ion]] were the legendary founders, respectively, of the four principal tribes of Hellas, the Aeolians, Dorians, Achaeans and Ionians. Originally, only members of a small tribe in [[Thessaly]] were called ''Hellenes'', but the term soon extended to the rest of the peninsula and came to encompass all Greek speakers. <ref>[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=Hellenic Etymonline: Hellenic]</ref> In early Christian times ''Hellene'' came to mean "[[Ancient Greek religion|pagan]]". It remains in Greece today, the primary national name.<ref name=BritIdent/>
*'''Greeks''' (<U+0393><U+03C1><U+03B1><U+03B9><U+03BA><U+03BF><U+03AF>) - In mythology, [[Graecus]] was the brother of [[Latinus]] and nephew of Hellen.<ref>Hesiod , ''Eoiae'' (Greek : ''<U+0397><U+03BF><U+03AF><U+03B1><U+03B9>'') or ''[[Catalogue of Women]]'', c.650 BC. </ref> It was the name of a [[Boeotia]]n tribe (''Graii'' lit. gray)<ref>Homer, ''"Iliad", II, 498''</ref>  that migrated to the Italian peninsula in the 8th century BCE and, probably through contact with natives there, came to represent all Greek speakers.<ref>Pausanias, ''Boeotics and Phocaeic'', Bk. 5, p. 136</ref> [[Aristotle]] and [[Apollodorus]] mention that it was the name used by Greeks before adopting the name Hellenes.<ref>Aristotle, ''[[Meteorologica]], I, 352a''</ref> It was later re-borrowed as an ethnonym by the Greeks themselves.<ref>[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?search=greek&searchmode=none Etymonline, Greek]</ref>
*'''Rhomioi''' (<U+03A1><U+03C9><U+03BC><U+03B9><U+03BF><U+03AF>) - ''Romans'' is the name by which the Byzantine Greeks called themselves during [[Late Antiquity]] and the [[Middle Ages]] while the term Byzantine would have been meaningless to them. The name in antiquity signified the inhabitants of the city of [[Rome]] in Italy, but after [[Constitutio Antoniniana|Caracalla's decree]] and the gradual formation of a Roman national identity among imperial subjects, it soon lost its exclusive connection with the [[Latins]]. Later, while in the West the term Roman acquired a new meaning in connection with the church and the [[Pope]] of [[Rome]] the Greek form [[Romaioi]] remained attached to the Greeks of the Eastern Roman Empire who still call themselves by that name today.<ref>Encyclopedia Britannica, ''History of Europe, The Romans'', 2008, O.Ed.</ref> The term ''Roman'' (''<U+03A1><U+03C9><U+03BC><U+03B1><U+03AF><U+03BF><U+03C2>'') represented for the Greeks their Roman citizenship and the word ''Romaioi'' came to represent the Greek inhabitants of the Byzantine Empire. Among Greeks it remains the most often used national name after ''Hellene'' and it is used by Turkey to signify the Greek Orthodox minority. It is found also in the [[Qur'an|Koran]]; ''Surah'' 30 is entitled [[Ar-Rum]], variously translated as The Romans, Byzantines, or Greeks.
*'''[[Achaeans]]''', '''[[Argives]]''', and '''[[Danaans]]''' are names used interchangeably by Homer, to signify the Greek allied forces. Danaans is attested in the [[Aeneid]] phrase ''timeo Danaos et dona ferentes'', (engl. ''beware of Greeks bearing gifts'')<ref>[[Aeneid]], II.49</ref>
*'''[[Yavan]]''' or '[[Javan]]', traditionally in Hebrew, Javan was the name of the tribe (and then the nation) which, according to the Torah, migrated from early Biblical times to establish the Balkan peninsula.<ref>''[[Genesis]]'', 10.2</ref>
*'''[[Yona]]''' or '''Yavana''', (<U+038A><U+03C9><U+03BD><U+03B5><U+03C2>), were names used by Indians who encountered Alexander the Great and his successors who ruled areas of Central Asia. Originally from the [[Persian language|Persian]] [[Yauna]], itself a transliteration of the Greek [[Ionia]], is the name by which the Greeks are known in the East today. The term became established in Asia by the Persians, who were in contact with the Ionian tribes in western Asia Minor from the 6th century BC and extended the name to all ''Hellenes''.<ref>[[Mahabharata]] 3.188.34-36</ref>

===Genetic origins===
Modern studies have constructed Greek [[genetic]] trees revealing a strong degree of homogeneity between Greeks from different geographical locations. Median networks revealed that most of the Greek haplotypes are clustered to the five known [[haplogroups]] and that a number of [[haplotypes]] are shared among Greeks and other European and Near Eastern populations. Within the loci studied, the genetic composition of the Greeks indicates a significantly low level of heterogeneity compared with other European populations.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Genetic studies in 5 Greek population samples using 12 highly polymorphic DNA loci |journal=Human Biology |date=Feb 1999 |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3659/is_199902/ai_n8845695}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |title=Mitochondrial DNA sequence variation in Greeks |journal=Human Biology |volume=Vol. 73 |issue=No. 6. |date=December 2001 |pages=pp. 855-869. |url=http://www.citeulike.org/user/Archaeogenetics/article/511923}}</ref> The levels of the [[Haplogroup R1a (Y-DNA)|R1a1 haplotype]], associated by some with Slavic migrations,<ref>{{Citation |author=Pericic et al. |year=2005 |title=High-resolution phylogenetic analysis of southeastern Europe traces major episodes of paternal gene flow among Slavic populations | periodical=Mol.

===Modern and ancient===
Some authors in the West and [[Turkey]]<ref>Deniz Bolukbasi, ''Turkey and Greece: The Aegean Disputes'', 2004, ISBN 1859419534</ref> have posited that the Greeks of today are not culturally or demographically related to the Greeks of [[classical antiquity]]. Notable among them was 19th century Austrian historian [[Jakob Philipp Fallmerayer]]. Fallmerayer averred that demographic continuity in Greece was interrupted brutally by successive waves of invasion and migration between the sixth and eighth centuries by [[Avar]]s, [[Slav]]s, and [[Albanians]] who occupied and settled in most of [[Central Greece]] and the [[Peloponnese]].<ref name="ADS">{{cite book |author=[[Anthony D.

===Demographics===
{{Main|Demographics of Greece|Demographics of Cyprus}}

Today Greeks are the majority ethnic group in the [[Hellenic Republic]]<ref name=Greece/> where they constitute 93% of that country's population and the [[Republic of Cyprus]]<ref name=Cyprus/> where they comprise 78% of the island's population (excluding Turkish settlers in the occupied part of the country). Greek populations have not traditionally exhibited high rates of growth; nonetheless the population of Greece has shown regular increase since the country's first census in 1828. Most of the population growth since the state's foundation has resulted from annexation of new territories and the influx of 1.5 million Greek refugees following the [[Population exchange between Greece and Turkey|1923 population exchange between Greece and Turkey]].<ref>Encyclopedia Britannica, Greece, Demography, 2008, O.Ed.</ref> About 80% of the population of Greece is urban<ref>Economist, World in Figures, 2007, ''Greece'', p.150</ref> with 28% concentrated in the city of Athens.<ref>Economist, World in Figures, 2007, ''Highest proportion of a country's population residing in a single city''</ref>

Greeks from Cyprus have a history of emigration, usually to the English speaking world as a result of the island's colonization by the [[British Empire]]. Waves of [[emigration]] followed the [[Turkish invasion of Cyprus]] in 1974, while the population decreased between mid-1974 and 1977 as a result of emigration, war losses and a temporary decline in fertility.

This contributed to a decrease in population which tapered off in the 1990's. More than two thirds of the Greek population in Cyprus is urban.<ref>Encyclopedia Britannica, Cyprus Demographic trends, 2008, O.Ed.</ref>

There is a sizeable Greek minority of about 60,000 people, in Albania.<ref name=Albania/> The Greek minority of Turkey which numbered upwards of 200,000 people after the 1923 exchange has now dwindled to a few thousand, following the 1955 [[Istanbul Pogrom]] and other state sponsored violence and discrimination. There are also smaller Greek minorities in the rest of the [[Balkan]] countries, the [[Levant]] and the [[Black Sea]] states, remnants of the Old [[Greek Diaspora]] (pre-19th century).<ref name=Prevelakis/> 

The New Greek Diaspora (post-19th century) has mainly been towards the Western, in particular the [[Anglosphere|English-speaking]], World. The Greek population outside Greece and Cyprus is around 5 million, though estimates vary.<ref name=Prevelakis/> The trend towards migration to the (modern) West began in the [[15th century]] and continues to this day as Greeks are attracted to the educational and professional opportunities available in the Western World. After [[Greece]] the second largest concentration of Greeks in one country is in the [[United States]], while [[New York City]] and [[Melbourne]] are among the largest "Greek" cities.

=== Diaspora ===
{{Main|Greek diaspora}}
The total number of Greeks living outside Greece and Cyprus today is a contentious issue. Where Census figures are available it shows around 3 million Greeks outside of [[Greece]] and [[Cyprus]]. Estimates provided by the ''Council of Hellenes Abroad'' {SAE} put the figure at around 7 million worldwide. According to George Prevelakis of [[Sorbonne University]] the number is closer to just below 5 million.<ref name=Prevelakis>[http://www.transcomm.ox.ac.uk/working%20papers/prevelakis.PDF George Prevelakis, Finis Greciae or the Return of the Greeks? State and Diaspora in the Context of Globalisation, p.4]</ref> Integration, intermarriage and loss of the Greek language also influence the definition and self-definition of [[Greek diaspora|Greeks of the Diaspora]].Important centres of the New Greek Diaspora today are  Chicago, London, New York, Melbourne and [[Toronto]].<ref name=Prevelakis/> Recently a law was passed by the Hellenic Parliament that enables Diaspora Greeks to vote in the elections of the Greek state.

[[Image:Location greek ancient.png|300px|right|thumb|Greek Diaspora 6th c. BC]]
In ancient times the trading and colonising activities of the Greek tribes and [[city states]] spread people of Greek culture, religion and language around the Mediterranean and Black Sea basins, especially in [[Sicily]], southern Italy, Spain, the South of France and the Black sea coasts. Under Alexander the Great's Empire Greek ruling classes were established in the Middle East, [[Indo-Greek Kingdom|India]] and in [[Ptolemaic dynasty|Egypt]]. The [[Hellenistic period]] is characterized by a new wave of Greek colonization which established Greek cities and Kingdoms in Asia and Africa. Under the Roman Empire movement of people spread Greeks across the Empire and in the eastern territories Greek became the [[lingua franca]] rather than [[Latin]].  The Roman Empire became Christianized in the fourth century AD, and in the Byzantine period practice of the Greek Orthodox form of Christianity became a defining hallmark of Greek identity.<ref>Peregrine Horden, Nicholas Purcell, ''The Corrupting Sea: A Study of Mediterranean History'',2000, Blackwell Publishing, ISBN 0631218904</ref>

[[Image:50 largest Greek diaspora.png|thumb|right|250px|Greek Diaspora 20th c.]]
During and after the Greek War of Independence, Greeks of the Diaspora were important in establishing the fledgling state, raising funds and awareness abroad. Greek merchant families already had contacts in other countries and during the disturbances many set up home around the Mediterranean (notably Marseilles in [[Greeks in France|France]], Livorno in [[Greeks in Italy|Italy]], Alexandria in [[Greeks in Egypt|Egypt]]), [[Greeks in Russia|Russia]] ([[Odessa]] and St Petersburg), and  [[British Greeks|Britain]] (London and Liverpool) from where they traded, typically in textiles and grain. Businesses frequently comprised the whole extended family, and with them they brought schools teaching Greek and the Greek Orthodox church. <ref>Ina Baghdiantz McCabe, Gelina Harlaftis, I<U+014D>anna Pepelas<U+0113> Minoglou, ''Diaspora Entrepreneurial Networks: Four Centuries of History'', 2000, p.147, Macmillan, ISBN 0333600479</ref>As markets changed and they became more established, some families grew their operations to become [[Greek shipping|shippers]], financed through the local Greek community, notably with the aid of the [[Ralli Brothers|Ralli]] or [[Panayis Athanase Vagliano|Vagliano Brothers]]. With economic success the Diaspora expanded further across the Levant, North Africa, India and the USA.<ref>Vassilis Kardasis, ''Diaspora Merchants in the Black Sea: The Greeks in Southern Russia, 1775-1861'',2001, Lexington Books, ISBN 0739102451</ref>

In the twentieth century many Greeks left the traditional homelands for economic reasons resulting in large migrations from Greece and Cyprus to the United States, Great Britain, Australia, Canada, Germany and South Africa, especially after the Second World War (1939-45) the [[Greek Civil War]] (1946-49) and the Turkish Invasion of Cyprus in 1974. <ref name=Clogg>Richard Clogg, ''The Greek diaspora in the twentieth century'', 2000, Macmillan, ISBN 0333600479</ref>

[[Image:Iliad VIII 245-253 in cod F205, Milan, Biblioteca Ambrosiana, late 5c or early 6c.jpg|thumb|200px|right|from a 6th century Iliad]]
Greeks speak the [[Greek language]], an [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European language]] which forms a branch in itself, although it is more closely related to [[Armenian language|Armenian]] (see also [[Graeco-Armenian]]) and the [[Indo-Iranian languages]].<ref>[[BBC]]: [http://www.bbc.co.uk/languages/european_languages/languages/greek.shtml Languages across Europe: Greek]</ref> It has the longest documented history of any language in the branch.<ref name=BritLang>Encyclopedia Britannica, ''Greek language'', 2008, O.Ed.</ref>
[[Greek literature]] has a continuous history of nearly 3,000 years, and has been written in the [[Greek alphabet]] since the 9th century BCE.<ref name=BritLit>Encyclopedia Britannica, ''Greek literature'', 2008, O.Ed.</ref> Several notable works have been originally written in Greek, including the Odyssey, Iliad and New Testament among others.

Greek demonstrates several linguistic features that are shared with the other Balkan languages, such as Albanian, Bulgarian and Romanian (see [[Balkan sprachbund]]), and has absorbed numerous foreign words (primarily of Western European and [[Turkish language|Turkish]] origin). Due to the movements of [[Philhellenism]] and the [[Diafotismos|Neohellenic Enlightenment]] in the 19th century, which emphasized the modern Greeks' ancient heritage, these foreign influences were excluded from official use via the creation of ''[[Katharevousa]]'', a somewhat artificial form of Greek purged of all foreign influence and words, as the official language of the Greek state. In 1976, however, the Greek parliament voted to make ''[[Dimotiki]]'' (based on the dialect of the Peloponnese) the official language, making ''Katharevusa'' obsolete.<ref>Encyclopedia Britannica, ''Katharevousa Greek language'', 2008, O.Ed.</ref>

Greek has a wide variety of dialects of varying levels of mutual intelligibility, which in addition to official variety (Standard Modern Greek - <U+039A><U+03BF><U+03B9><U+03BD><U+03AE> <U+039D><U+03B5><U+03BF><U+03B5><U+03BB><U+03BB><U+03B7><U+03BD><U+03B9><U+03BA><U+03AE>), include the [[Cypriot Greek|Cypriot]], [[Pontic language|Pontic]], [[Cappadocian Greek language|Cappadocian]], [[Griko language|Griko]] ([[Greek-Calabrian dialect|Calabrian Greek]]) and [[Tsakonian language|Tsakonian]] (the only surviving representative of ancient [[Doric Greek]]) varieties.<ref>Olga Miseska Tomic, ''Balkan Sprachbund Morpho-Syntactic Features'', 2006, Springer, p. 703, ISBN 1402044879</ref> [[Yevanic language|Yevanic]], also known as Romaniote or Judeo-Greek, is the language of the Greek Jews ([[Romaniotes]]), and survives in small communities in Greece, New York and Israel. 

In addition to Greek, many Greeks in Greece are bilingual in other languages. Such languages include [[Arvanitic language|Arvanitic]], [[Aromanian language|Aromanian]] (also known as Vlach), [[Slavic language (Greece)|Slavic]] (also known as ''Dopia''), [[Russian language|Russian]], [[Italian language|Italian]], [[English language|English]], and [[Turkish language|Turkish]].<ref>Ralph W. Fasold, ''The Sociolinguistics of Society'', 1984, Blackwell Publishing, p.160, ISBN 063113462X</ref> In the [[Greek diaspora|Diaspora]], Greeks also speak the languages of the areas in which they live. Some members of the Diaspora cannot speak Greek, but are still considered Greeks by ethnic origin or descent.<ref>Geoffrey C.

===Religion===
{{seealso|Greek Orthodoxy}}
[[Image:Greek manuscript uncial 4th century.png|thumb|right|150px|from a 4th-century Bible]]
The majority of Greeks are [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox Christians]], belonging to the [[Greek Orthodox Church]]. During the first centuries after Christ, the [[New Testament]] was originally compiled in [[Koine Greek]] language, which is mutually intelligible with [[modern Greek]] to a great extent, as most of the early Christians and Church Fathers were Greek speakers.  While the Orthodox Church was always intensely hostile to the [[Greek religion|old religion]] it did help Greeks retain their sense of identity during the Ottoman rule through its use of Greek in the liturgy and its modest educational efforts. <ref>Encyclopedia Britannica, ''Greece under Ottoman rule, The role of the Orthodox church'', 2008, O.Ed.</ref> There are also small groups of ethnic Greeks adhering to other Christian denominations or religions. The main heterodox denominations in the Greek world are [[Romaniotes|Greek Jews]],  [[Greek Catholics]], [[Greek Muslims]], [[Greek Evangelical Church|Greek Evangelicals]]and other [[Protestantism|Protestant]] groups.

About 2,000 people are members of [[Hellenic Neopaganism|Dodekatheism]] congregations.<ref>[http://www.newstatesman.com/200703200001 Newstatesman - The ancient gods of Greece are not extinct]</ref><ref>[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2004/05/08/wgods08.xml Telegraph.co.uk - Modern Athenians fight for the right to worship the ancient Greek gods]</ref><ref>The US government gives a generic number of 2,000.[http://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2006/71383.htm United States Department of State - International Religious Freedom Report 2006]</ref> The leaders of the movement put the number much higher: from 100,000 or 200,000 (1%, 2% of the total)<ref>[http://www.newstatesman.com/200703200001 Newstatesman - The ancient gods of Greece are not extinct]</ref><ref>[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2004/05/08/wgods08.xml Telegraph.co.uk - Modern Athenians fight for the right to worship the ancient Greek gods]</ref> to 400,000 (4%)<ref>[http://www.euronews.net/index.php?page=info&article=412443&lng=4 Euro News - in Italian]</ref> Recently, Neopagans have been subject to [[Discrimination against Neopagans#Greece|discrimination]].

=== Art ===
{{Main|Greek art}}
Greek art has a long and varied history. Greeks have made several contributions to the visual, literary and performing arts. <ref>Susie Hodge, ''Ancient Greek Art'', 1998, Heinemann Interactive Library, ISBN 1575725517</ref> In the West [[ancient Greek art]] was influential in shaping the [[Roman art|Roman]] and later the modern [[Western art|Western artistic]] heritage. Following the Renaissance in Europe, the humanist aesthetic and the high technical standards of Greek art inspired generations of European artists. Well into the 19th century, the classical tradition derived from Greece played an important part the art of the Western World.<ref>John Boardman, ''The Diffusion of Classical Art in Antiquity'', 1994, Princeton University Press ISBN 0691036802</ref>  In the East, Alexander the Great's conquests initiated several centuries of exchange between Greek, Central Asian and Indian cultures, resulting in [[Greco-Buddhist art]], whose influence reached as far as Japan. <ref>Jerry H.Bentley, ''Old World Encounters. Cross-cultural contacts and exchanges in pre-modern times'', Oxford University Press, 1993, ISBN 0195076397</ref> 

Byzantine Greek art, which grew from [[Fayum portraits|classical art]], provided a stimulus to the art of many nations. Its influences can be traced from Venice in the West to Kazakhstan in the East and [[Byzantine art]] is one of the most striking features of that civilization.<ref>C. Mango, ed., ''The art of the Byzantine Empire, 312-1453: sources and documents'', 1986, University of Toronto Press, ISBN 0802066275</ref><ref>[http://www.economist.com/books/displaystory.cfm?story_id=9900058 Economist, ''The Byzantine Empire, The lasting glory of its art''], Oct 4th 2007 </ref> 

In turn Greek art was influenced by Eastern Civilizations in Classical Antiquity and the new religion of Orthodox Christianity during Byzantine times while [[modern Greek art]] is heavily influenced by [[Western art]].<ref>John Griffiths Pedley, Greek Art and Archaeology,2007,Pearson/Prentice Hall,ISBN 0132380625</ref> Notable Greek artists include [[Renaissance]] painter [[El Greco]], soprano [[Maria Callas]], and composer [[Vangelis]]. Greek [[Alexandria]]n [[Constantine P. Cavafy]] and [[nobel prize|Nobel laureate]]s [[George Seferis]] and [[Odysseas Elitis]] are among the most important poets of the twentieth century.

[[Image:Nicholas negroponte.jpg|thumb|right|150px|[[Nicholas Negroponte]]]]
The Greeks of the Classical era made several notable contributions to science and helped lay the foundations of modern scientific principles. The scholarly tradition of the Greek academies was maintained during Roman times with several academic institutions in [[Constantinople]], [[Antioch]], [[Alexandria]] and other centres of Greek learning. Byzantine science was essentially classical science.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://historymedren.about.com/gi/dynamic/offsite.htm?zi=1/XJ/Ya&sdn=historymedren&cdn=education&tm=7&f=00&tt=14&bt=0&bts=0&zu=http%3A//www.med.virginia.edu/hs-library/historical/antiqua/texte.htm |title= Byzantine Medicine - Vienna Dioscurides|accessdate=2007-05-27 |format= |work=Antiqua Medicina|publisher=University of Virginia }}</ref>

The Greek world has a long tradition of valuing and investing in ''padeia'' (education). ''Paideia'' was one of the highest societal values in the Greek and Hellenistic world while the first European institution described as a university was founded in [[9th century]] Constantinople and operated in various incarnations until the [[Fall of Constantinople|city's fall]] to the Ottomans in [[1453]].<ref name="texor">[http://www.cwrl.utexas.edu/~bump/OriginUniversities.html The Origin of Universities]</ref> The [[University of Constantinople]] was also Christian Europe's first secular institution of higher learning since no theological subjects were taught.<ref>{{cite book | last=Tatakes |first=Vasileios N. |coauthors=Moutafakis, Nicholas J. | title=Byzantine Philosophy | year=2003 | publisher=Hackett Publishing|isbn=0-872-20563-0|pages=189}}</ref>

As of 2007 Greece had the eighth highest percentage of tertiary enrolment in the world (with the percentages for female students being higher than for male) while Greeks of the Diaspora are equally active in the field of education.<ref>The Economist Intelligence Unit, ''World in Figures 2007, Tertiary Enrollment as percentage of relevant age group''</ref> Hundreds of thousands of Greek students attend Western universities every year while the faculty lists of leading Western universities contain a striking number of Greek names.<ref>[http://www.economist.com/world/europe/displaystory.cfm?story_id=E1_STQTVNJ The Economist, University reforms in Greece face student protests], Jul 6th 2006</ref> Notable Greek scientists of modern times include [[Georgios Papanikolaou]] (inventor of the [[Pap test]]), [[Nicholas Negroponte]],[[Constantin Carath<U+00E9>odory]], [[Michael Dertouzos]], and [[Dimitri Nanopoulos]].

The most widely used symbol used by Greeks is the [[flag of Greece]], which features nine equal horizontal stripes of blue alternating with white representing the nine syllables of the Greek national motto "<U+0395><U+03BB><U+03B5><U+03C5><U+03B8><U+03B5><U+03C1><U+03AF><U+03B1> <U+03AE> <U+03B8><U+03AC><U+03BD><U+03B1><U+03C4><U+03BF><U+03C2>" (''[[Eleftheria i thanatos]]'' <U+2013> freedom or death), which was also the motto of the [[Greek War of Independence]]. The blue square in the upper hoist-side corner bears a white cross, which represents [[Greek Orthodox]] Christianity. The Greek flag is also widely used by the Greek community in [[Cyprus]] (which has officially adopted a neutral flag so as to ease ethnic tensions with the [[Turkish]] minority <U+2013> see [[flag of Cyprus]]), and by the Greek minority in [[Albania]], which has led to ethnic clashes with the ethnic [[Albanian]] majority).<ref>[http://www.presidency.gr/en/shmaia.htm Presidency of the Hellenic Republic], ''The Flag''</ref>

The pre-1978 (and first) flag of [[Greece]], which features a [[Greek cross]] (''crux immissa quadrata'') on a blue background, is widely used as an alternative to the official flag, and they are often flown together. The [[national emblem of Greece]] features a blue [[escutcheon]] with a white cross totally surrounded by two laurel branches. A common design involves the current flag of Greece and the pre-1978 flag of Greece with crossed flagpoles and the national emblem placed in front.<ref>Chevalier, Jean, ''The Penguin Dictionary of Symbols'', 1997, Penguin ISBN 0140512543</ref>

Another highly recognizable and popular Greek symbol is the [[Flag of Greece#The Double-headed eagle|double-headed eagle]], the imperial emblem of the [[Byzantine Empire]] and a common symbol in [[Eastern Europe]]. It is not currently part of the modern Greek flag or coat of arms, although it is officially the insignia of the [[Greek Army]] and the flag of the [[Church of Greece]]. It had been incorporated in the Greek coat of arms between 1925 and 1926.<ref>[http://www.heraldica.org/topics/national/byzantin.htm Byzantine Heraldry]</ref>

===Surnames===
{{seealso|Surnames#Greece}}

Greek surnames are most commonly [[patronymic]]s. Occupation, characteristic and location/origin-based surnames names also occur. Prior to the introduction of written records in the [[19th century]], surnames were not formally maintained and could be changed by occupation or characteristic. After the advent of widespread written records, [[Surnames#Greece|surnames]] have remained constant handed down from father to children.

Some surnames are prefixed with ''Papa-'', indicating ancestry from a priest. ''Archi-'' and ''Mastro-'' signify "first" and "tradesman" respectively. Prefixes such as ''Konto-'', ''Makro-'', and ''Chondro-'', describe body characteristics, such as "short", "tall/long" and "fat". ''Gero-'' and ''Palaio-'' signify "old" or "wise". Other prefixes include ''[[hajji|Hadji]]-'' which was an honorific deriving from the Arabic [[Hadj]] or pilgrimage, and indicate that the person had made a pilgrimage (in the case of [[Christians]] to [[Jerusalem]]) and ''Kara-'' which is attributed to the [[Turkish language|Turkish]] word for "black" deriving from the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman era]].<ref>Patrick Hanks, Flavia Hodges, '' A Dictionary of Surnames'', 1988, Oxford University Press, ISBN 0192115928</ref>
  
Most Greek patronymic suffixes are diminutives, which vary by region. The most common Hellenic patronymic suffixes are ''-poulos/-poulou'' (from [[Peloponessus]], a suffix which means "the little", representing "the son of " i.e. "Michalopoulos", the "son of Michael" or "Papadopoulos", the "son of the priest"). The suffix ''-akis/-aki''  is associated primarily with [[Crete]] but also [[Mani]], where it is rendered ''-akos/-akou'', and the [[Aegean islands]], is a patronymic signifying "little" and "son of".<ref>[http://www.mani.org.gr/fonimanis/2001/1_2001epif_epon.htm Academy of Athens, Maniote surnames]</ref> It became almost universal by the mid 20th century in [[Crete]], but was only adopted there in the 19th century. The suffix ''-idis-ides/-idou'' or ''-iadis/-iadou'' is the oldest  last name and clan form in use and is associated with Greeks originating in [[Asia Minor]] and the [[Pontus]]. It is also analogous to the [[English language|English]] '''''-son'''''. Zeus, for example was also referred to as ''[[Cronides]]'' ("son of Cronus").<ref>Elsdon Coles Smith, ''American Surnames'',1986, Genealogical Publishing Company,ISBN 0806311509</ref>

===Sea===
{{Main|Greek shipping}}
[[Image:WorldMapCosmasIndicopleustes.jpg|thumb|200px|6th century map by [[Cosmas Indicopleustes]].]]

The traditional Greek homelands have been the Greek peninsula and the Aegean, the Black Sea and [[Ionia|Ionian coasts]] of Asia Minor, the islands of Cyprus and [[Sicily]] and the [[Magna Grecia|south of the Italian peninsula]]. In Plato's [[Phaidon]] Socrates remarks that "we (Greeks) live like ants or frogs around a pond".<ref>Plato, Phaidon, 109c, ''<U+1F65><U+03C3><U+03C0><U+03B5><U+03C1> <U+03C0><U+03B5><U+03C1><U+1F76> <U+03C4><U+03AD><U+03BB><U+03BC><U+03B1> <U+03BC><U+03CD><U+03C1><U+03BC><U+03B7><U+03BA><U+03B1><U+03C2> <U+1F22> <U+03B2><U+03B1><U+03C4><U+03C1><U+03AC><U+03C7><U+03BF><U+03C5><U+03C2> <U+03C0><U+03B5><U+03C1><U+1F76> <U+03C4><U+1F74><U+03BD> <U+03B8><U+03AC><U+03BB><U+03B1><U+03C4><U+03C4><U+03B1><U+03BD> <U+03BF><U+1F30><U+03BA><U+03BF><U+1FE6><U+03BD><U+03C4><U+03B1><U+03C2>''</ref> This image is attested by the map of the Old Greek Diaspora, which corresponded to the Greek world until the creation of the [[Greece|Greek state]] in 1832. The [[sea]] and trade were natural outlets for Greeks since the Greek peninsula is rocky and does not offer good prospects for agriculture.<ref name=Roberts1/>

The sea has always been a defining feature of Greek culture, with numerous songs and poems about the sea and seascapes attested in Greek art. In war among the many battles that the Greek Nation was called to fight the most decisive one was the sea  [[Battle of Salamis|battle at Salamis]] which has been described as one of the most important battles in history.  A notable Greek explorer was the 6th century merchant and later monk [[Cosmas Indicopleustes]] ("''Cosmas who sailed to India''").<ref>Beatrice Nicolini, Penelope-Jane Watson, ''Makran, Oman, and Zanzibar: Three-terminal Cultural Corridor in the Western Indian Ocean (1799-1856)'', 2004, BRILL, ISBN 9004137807</ref> In later times the [[Rhomioi]] plied the sea-lanes of the [[Mediterranean]] and controled trade untill an embargo imposed by the [[Byzantine Emperor|Roman Emperor]] on trade with the Muslims opened the door for the later Italian pre-eminence in trade. 

The Greek shipping tradition recovered during the Ottoman rule when a substantial merchant middle class developed, aided in part by the [[Treaty of K<U+00FC><U+00E7><U+00FC>k Kaynarca]] ([[21 July]] [[1774]]) between the Ottoman Empire and the [[Russian Empire]]. It granted Russia some economic and political rights in the Ottoman Empire, such as allowing Ottoman [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox Christians]] to sail under the [[Flag of Russia|Russian flag]]. This was in effect a Russian guarantee on all Greek ships that flew the Russian flag, spurring the creation of a [[merchant marine]] on the three nautical islands of [[Hydra]], [[Spetses]] and [[Psara]].<ref name=BritMerchant/> These sailors also played an important part in the Greek War of Independence.

Today, Greek shipping continues to prosper to the extent that Greece has the largest merchant fleet in the world, and many more ships under Greek ownership fly flags of convenience.<ref>Economist, World in figures, 2007 ed., ''Merchant marine'', p.76</ref> The most notable shipping [[magnate]] of the 20th century was [[Aristotle Onassis]],<ref>Blyth, Myrna, [[National Review Online]], [http://article.nationalreview.com/?q=NDRjYzJhMWI5ZjE3ZmNmOWQ0YWEyNjBkYmI1MjhiODI= ''Greek Tragedy, The life of Aristotle Onassis''], Retrieved on [[2008-04-05]].</ref><ref>Smith, Helena, [[The Guardian]], [http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2006/oct/06/arts.artsnews ''Callas takes centre stage again as exhibition recalls Onassis's life''], Retrieved on [[2008-04-05]].</ref> others being  [[Yiannis Latsis]], [[George Livanos]], and [[Stavros Niarchos]]. A famous Greek poet of the 20th century was the Chinese-born seaman [[Nikos Kavvadias]] who expressed the spirit of Greek cosmopolitanism and effortless and unpretentious [[multiculturalism]].<ref>[http://www.eleftherovima.gr/cgi-bin/news/viewnews.cgi?newsid1048170154,681, Eleuthero Vima article: The sea in Greek tradition]</ref>

==Timeline==
The history of the Greek people is closely associated with the [[history of Greece]], Cyprus, Constantinople, and Asia Minor. During the Ottoman rule of Greece, a number of Greek enclaves around the Mediterranean were cut off from the core, notably in Southern Italy, the Caucasus, Syria and Egypt. By the early 20th century, over half of the overall [[Greek language|Greek]]-speaking population was settled in Asia Minor (now Turkey). During the 20th century, a huge wave of migration to the United States, Australia, Canada and elsewhere created a Greek diaspora.

''Some key historical events have also been included for context, but '''this timeline is not intended to cover history not related to migrations'''. There is more information on the historical context of these migrations in [[History of Greece]].''
