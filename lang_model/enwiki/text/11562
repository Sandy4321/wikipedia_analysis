'''Jinn''' ({{lang-ar|<U+062C><U+0646>}} ''{{transl|ar|DIN|<U+01E7>inn}}'', singular {{lang|ar|<U+062C><U+0646><U+064A>}} ''{{transl|ar|DIN|<U+01E7>inn<U+012B> }} ''; variant spelling ''djinn'') or '''[[wikt:genie|genies]]''' are [[supernatural]] creatures as mentioned in the Qur'an and often referred to in Arab folklore and [[Islamic mythology]] that occupy a [[multiverse|parallel world]] to that of mankind.  Together, jinn, humans and [[Angels in Islam|angels]] make up the three sentient creations of [[Allah]]. Religious sources say barely anything about them; however, the [[Quran|Qur'an]] mentions that Jinn are made of smokeless flame or "scorching fire".<ref>Qur<U+2019><U+0101>n 15:27),</ref> Like human beings, the Jinn can also be good, evil, or neutrally benevolent.<ref>El-Zein, Amira. [http://books.google.com/books?id=H-k9oc9xsuAC&pg=PA116-IA117&lpg=PA116-IA117&dq=Jinn:+Medieval+Islamic+Civilization+-+An+Encyclopaedia&source=bl&ots=TSnTkHUY_j&sig=mXTd96-4uH5A5dpRvcBvgDGjUS4&hl=en&ei=HScES6WOBMLDlAek9IHtAQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=2&ved=0CAwQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q=Jinn%3A%20Medieval%20Islamic%20Civilization%20-%20An%20Encyclopaedia&f=false "Jinn,"] 420-421, in [[Joseph W. Meri|Meri, Joseph W.]], ''Medieval Islamic Civilization - An Encyclopedia''.</ref>

The jinn are mentioned frequently in the Qur'an, and there is a [[Sura|surah]] entitled [[Al-Jinn|S<U+016B>rat al-Jinn]] in the Qur'an. It is in the 72nd chapter of the Qur'an. In many modern cultures, a Genie is portrayed as a magical being that grants wishes. The earliest of such Jinn stories in folklore originate in the book of the ''[[One Thousand and One Nights]]''.<ref>http://classiclit.about.com/library/bl-etexts/arabian/bl-arabian-jinni.htm</ref>

==Etymology and definitions==
''Jinn'' is a noun of the [[collective number]] in Arabic, derived from the [[Semitic root|Arabic root]] ''{{transl|ar|DIN|<U+01E7>-n-n}}'' meaning 'to hide' or 'be hidden'. Other words derived from this root are ''{{transl|ar|DIN|ma<U+01E7>n<U+016B>n}}'' 'mad' (literally, 'one whose intellect is hidden'), ''{{transl|ar|DIN|<U+01E7>un<U+016B>n}}'' 'madness', and ''{{transl|ar|DIN|<U+01E7>an<U+012B>n}}'' 'embryo, fetus' ('hidden inside the womb').<ref>{{cite book |title=[[Dictionary of Modern Written Arabic]] |last=Wehr |first=Hans |authorlink=Hans Wehr |year=1994 |edition=4 |publisher=Spoken Language Services |location=Urbana, Illinois |isbn=9780879500030 |page=164}}</ref>

The Arabic root ''{{transl|ar|DIN|<U+01E7>-n-n}}'' means 'to hide, conceal'. A word for garden or Paradise, {{lang|ar|<U+062C><U+0646><U+0651><U+0629>}} ''[[jannah|{{transl|ar|DIN|<U+01E7>annah}}]]'', is a cognate of the Hebrew word <U+05D2><U+05DF> ''gan'' 'garden', derived from the same [[Semitic root]]. In arid climates, gardens have to be protected against desertification by walls; this is the same concept as in the word "[[paradise]]" from ''[[Paradise#Etymology_and_Semasiology|pairi-da<U+00EA>za]]'', an [[Avestan language|Avestan]] word for garden that literally means 'having walls built around'. Thus the protection of a garden behind walls implies its being hidden from the outside. Arabic lexicons such as [[Edward William Lane]]'s ''Arabic-English Lexicon'' define ''{{transl|ar|DIN|<U+01E7>inn}}'' not only as spirits, but also anything concealed through time, status, and even physical darkness.<ref>[http://www.studyquran.org/LaneLexicon/Volume2/00000098.pdf Edward William Lane<U+2019>s Arabic Lexicon]</ref>

The word ''genie'' in English is derived from Latin ''[[genius (mythology)|genius]]'', meant a sort of tutelary or guardian spirit thought to be assigned to each person at their birth, which also has its origin in the Arabic word jinn.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}} English borrowed the French descendant of this word, ''g<U+00E9>nie''; its earliest written attestation in English, in 1655, is a plural spelled "genyes." The French translators of ''[[The Book of One Thousand and One Nights]]'' used ''g<U+00E9>nie'' as a translation of ''jinn<U+012B>'' because it was similar to the Arabic word in sound and in meaning. This use was also adopted in English and has since become dominant.{{Citation needed|date=December 2011}}

Many cultural interpretations noted the Jinn as having distinct male and females, they would often appear wearing vests and sashes, various interpretations note that they tied their hair long vertically. According to various stories Jinn could exist independently or bound to any particular object.

In [[Arabic]], the word ''{{transl|ar|DIN|<U+01E7>inn}}'' is in the [[collective number]], translated in English as plural (e.g., "several genies"); ''{{transl|ar|DIN|<U+01E7>inn<U+012B>}}'' is in the [[singulative number]], used to refer to one individual, which is translated by the singular in English (e.g., "one genie"). Therefore, the word 'jinn' in [[English language|English]] writing is treated as a plural.

The modern word genes or genetics is sometimes thought to have its origin in the Arabic word jinn, as it was considered that the expression of familial characteristics was also the effect of the jinn.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}. However, the correct etymology is from Latin genus, originally Greek genos and Sanskrit janas <ref>http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/77719#eid3091885</ref>

==Jinn in the pre-Islamic era==
[[File:Jinn from Ali manuscript.jpg|thumb|right|Ahsan-ol-Kobar, Ali and the Jinn, [[Golestan Palace]], 1568]]
Amongst [[archeology|archaeologists]] dealing with ancient [[Middle Eastern]] cultures, any spirit lesser than angels is often referred to as a ''jinni'', especially when describing stone carvings or other forms of art.{{Citation needed|date=December 2011}}

Inscriptions found in Northwestern Arabia seem to indicate the worship of jinn, or at least their tributary status. For instance, an inscription from Beth Fasi'el near [[Palmyra]] pays tribute to the "''Jinnaye''", the "good and rewarding gods".<ref>Hoyland, R. G., Arabia and the Arabs: From the Bronze Age to the Coming of Islam.</ref>

In the following verse, the Qur'an rejects the worship of jinn and stresses that only God should be worshiped:

"''Yet, they join the jinns as partners in worship with Allah, though He has created them (the jinns), and they attribute falsely without knowledge sons and daughters to Him. Be He Glorified and Exalted above (all) that they attribute to Him.''" (Qur'an 6:100)

In the [[One Thousand and One Nights]] the types of Jinn are known to coexist with Humans, ''[[Devil (Islam)|{{transl|ar|DIN|<U+0161>ay<U+1E6D><U+0101>n}}]]'', the ''[[ghoul|{{transl|ar|DIN|Ghoul}}]]'', the ''[[marid|{{transl|ar|DIN|Marid}}]]'', the ''[[ifrit|{{transl|ar|DIN|Ifrit}}]]'', and the [[Angel (Islam)|Angel]]s. According to the [[One Thousand and One Nights]], [[Ifrit]]s seem to be the most massive and strongest forms of Jinn and [[Marid]]s are a type of Jinn associated with seas and oceans.

==Jinn in Islam==
In [[Islamic theology]] jinn are said to be creatures with [[free will]], made from smokeless fire by [[Allah]] as humans were made of clay, among other things.<ref>{{Quran-usc|55|14|end=15|style=nosup}}</ref>  According to the [[Qur'an]], jinn have free will, and ''[[Devil (Islam)|{{transl|ar|DIN|<U+02BE>Ibl<U+012B>s}}]]'' abused this freedom in front of Allah by refusing to bow to [[Adam]] when Allah ordered angels and jinn to do so. For disobeying Allah, he was expelled from Paradise and called "''[[Devil (Islam)|{{transl|ar|DIN|<U+0160>ay<U+1E6D><U+0101>n}}]]''" (Satan). Jinn are frequently mentioned in the [[Qur'an]]: [[Sura|Surah]] 72 (named ''[[Al-Jinn|S<U+016B>rat al-Jinn]]'') is named after the jinn, and has a passage about them. Another surah (''[[Al-Nas|S<U+016B>rat al-N<U+0101>s]]'') mentions jinn in the last verse.<ref>{{Quran-usc|116|4|end=4|style=nosup}}</ref> The Qur'an also mentions that [[Muhammad]] was sent as a [[prophets of Islam|prophet]] to both "humanity and the jinn," and that prophets and [[Apostle (Islam)|messengers]] were sent to both communities.<ref>{{Quran-usc|51|56|end=56|style=nosup}}</ref><ref>Mu<U+1E25>ammad ibn Ayy<U+016B>b al-<U+1E6C>abar<U+012B>, ''Tu<U+1E25>fat al-ghar<U+0101><U+2019>ib'', I, p. 68; Ab<U+016B> al-Fut<U+016B><U+1E25> R<U+0101>z<U+012B>, ''Tafs<U+012B>r-e raw<U+1E25> al-jen<U+0101>n va r<U+016B><U+1E25> al-jan<U+0101>n'', pp. 193, 341</ref>

Similar to humans, jinn have free will allowing them to do as they choose (such as follow any religion).  They are usually invisible to humans, and humans do not appear clearly to them.  Jinn have the power to travel large distances at extreme speeds and are thought to live in remote areas, mountains, seas, trees, and the air, in their own communities. Like humans, jinn will also be judged on the [[Day of Judgment]] and will be sent to [[Jannah|Paradise]] or [[Jahannam|Hell]] according to their deeds.<ref>''Tafs<U+012B>r''; ''Bakhsh az tafs<U+012B>r-e kohan'', p. 181; Loeffler, p. 46</ref>

===Classifications and characteristics===
The social organization of the jinn community resembles that of humans; e.g., they have kings, courts of law, weddings, and mourning rituals.<ref><U+1E6C><U+016B>s<U+012B>, p. 484; Foz<U+016B>n<U+012B>, p. 527</ref> A few traditions (hadith), divide jinn into three classes: those who have wings and fly in the air, those who resemble snakes and dogs, and those who travel about ceaselessly.<ref>Foz<U+016B>n<U+012B>, p. 526</ref> Other reports claim that [[Abd Allah ibn Mas'ud|<U+2018>Abd All<U+0101>h ibn Mas<U+2018><U+016B>d]] (d. [[652]]), who was accompanying Muhammad when the jinn came to hear his recitation of the Qur<U+2019>an, described them as creatures of different forms; some resembling vultures and snakes, others tall men in white garb.<ref>Foz<U+016B>n<U+012B>, pp. 525-26</ref> They may even appear as dragons, [[onagers]], or a number of other animals.<ref>Kolayn<U+012B>, I, p. 396; Sol<U+1E6D><U+0101>n-Mo<U+1E25>ammad, p. 62</ref> In addition to their animal forms, the jinn occasionally assume human form to mislead and destroy their human victims.<ref>M<U+012B>hand<U+016B>st, p. 44</ref> Certain [[hadiths]] have also claimed that the jinn may subsist on bones, which will grow flesh again as soon as they touch them, and that their animals may live on dung, which will revert to grain or grass for the use of the jinn flocks.<ref>Abu<U+2019>l-Fot<U+016B><U+1E25>, XVII, pp. 280-81</ref>

[[Ibn Taymiyyah]] believed the jinn were generally "ignorant, untruthful, oppressive and treacherous,"<ref name="taym">[[Ibn Taymiyyah]], ''al-Furq<U+0101>n bayna awliy<U+0101><U+2019> al-Ra<U+1E25>m<U+0101>n wa-awliy<U+0101><U+2019> al-Shay<U+1E6D><U+0101>n'' ("Essay on the Jinn"), translated by Abu Ameenah Bilal Phillips</ref> thus representing the very strict interpretations adhered by the [[Salafi]] schools of thought.

Ibn Taymiyyah believes that the jinn account for much of the "magic" perceived by humans, cooperating with magicians to lift items in the air unseen, delivering hidden truths to [[fortune teller]]s, and mimicking the voices of deceased humans during [[seance]]s.<ref name="taym"/>

===Qar<U+012B>n===
A related belief is that every person is assigned one's own special jinn<U+012B>, also called a ''[[qareen|qar<U+012B>n]]'', of the jinn that whisper to people's souls and tell them to submit to evil desires.<ref>{{Quran-usc|72|1|end=2|style=nosup}}</ref><ref>{{Quran-usc|15|18|end=18|style=nosup}}</ref><ref>''[[Sahih Muslim]]'', No. 2714</ref>  The notion of a ''qar<U+012B>n'' is not universally accepted amongst all Muslims, but it is generally accepted that [[Devil (Islam)|{{transl|ar|DIN|<U+0160>ay<U+1E6D><U+0101>n}}]] whispers in human minds, and he is assigned to each human being.<ref>[http://newsgroups.derkeiler.com/pdf/Archive/Alt/alt.religion.islam/2005-08/msg00492.pdf ''Is it permissible to pray that my qareen becomes Muslim'']</ref>

===Jinn in Muslim cultures===
[[File:ManuscriptAbbasid.jpg|thumb|right|A manuscript of the [[One Thousand and One Nights]].]]

The stories of the Jinn can be found in various [[List of countries by Muslim population|Muslim cultures]] around the world. In [[Morocco]], Jinn are believed to grant three magical wishes. In [[Sindh]] the concept of the Jinni was introduced during the [[Abbasid Caliphate|Abbasid Era]] and has become a common part of the local folklore which also includes stories of both male Jinn called "Jinn" and female Jinn called "Jiniri". Folk stories of female Jinni include stories such as the ''Jejhal Jiniri''. 

More acclaimed stories of the Jinn can be found in the [[One Thousand and One Nights]] story of the ''Fisherman and the Jinni''<ref>http://classiclit.about.com/library/bl-etexts/arabian/bl-arabian-jinni.htm</ref>; more than three different types of Jinn are described in the story of ''Maruf the Cobbler''<ref>http://www.scribd.com/doc/53819003/47/Maruf-the-Cobbler</ref><ref>http://www.wollamshram.ca/1001/Vol_10/tale169.htm</ref>; a mighty Jinni helps young Aladdin in the story of ''Alladin and the Wonderful Lamp''<ref>http://classiclit.about.com/library/bl-etexts/arabian/bl-arabian-alladin.htm</ref>; as Hassan Badr ad-Din weeps over the grave of his father until sleep overcomes him he is awoken by a large group of sympathetic Jinni in the ''Tale of Ali Nur ad-Din and his son Badr ad-Din Hassan''.<ref>http://classiclit.about.com/library/bl-etexts/arabian/bl-arabian-nuraldin.htm</ref>

During the [[Rwandan genocide]] both [[Hutu]]s and [[Tutsi]] avoided searching in local [[Rwanda]]n [[Muslim]] neighborhoods and widely believed myths that local [[Muslim]]s and [[Mosque]]s were protected by the power of Islamic magic and the efficacious Jinn.<ref>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islam_in_Rwanda</ref> In [[Cyangugu]], arsonists ran away instead of destroying the Mosque because they believed Jinn were guarding the Mosque and feared their wrath.<ref name = "Kubai">{{cite journal

===Relationship of King Solomon and the genies===
{{main|Islamic view of Solomon}}

According to traditions, the jinn stood behind the learned humans in Solomon's court, who in turn, sat behind the prophets. The jinn remained in the service of Solomon, who had placed them in bondage, and had ordered them to perform a number of tasks.

"''...and there were jinn that worked in front of him, by the leave of his Lord,''" (Qur'an 32:12)

"''And before Solomon were marshalled his hosts,- of jinn and men and birds, and they were all kept in order and ranks.''" (Quran 27:17)

The Qur'an relates that Solomon died while he was leaning on his staff. As he remained upright, propped on his staff, the jinn thought he was still alive and supervising them, so they continued to work. They realized the truth only when Allah sent a creature to crawl out of the ground and gnaw at Solomon's staff until his body collapsed. The Qur'an then comments that if they had known the unseen, they would not have stayed in the humiliating torment of being enslaved.

"''Then, when We decreed (Solomon's) death, nothing showed them his death except a little worm of the earth, which kept (slowly) gnawing away at his staff: so when he fell down, the jinn saw plainly that if they had known the unseen, they would not have tarried in the humiliating Penalty (of their Task)''." Qur'an 34:14)

==Existence and usage of jinn in other cultures==
[[File:LLW Aladdin genie.jpg|thumb|right|Genie in Legoland]]
In [[Guanches|Guanche]] mythology from [[Tenerife]] in the [[Canary Islands]], there existed the belief in beings that are similar to genies{{Synthesis-inline|date=February 2011}}, such as the ''[[maxios]]'' or ''dioses paredros'' ('attendant gods', domestic and nature spirits) and ''[[tibicena]]s'' (evil genies), as well as the demon [[Guayota]] (aboriginal god of evil) that, like the Arabic ''[[Devil (Islam)|{{transl|ar|DIN|<U+02BE>Ibl<U+012B>s}}]]'', is sometimes identified with a genie.<ref>[http://www.eldia.es/2009-08-23/CRITERIOS/3-Religion-guanche.htm Guanche Religion]</ref>

===Jinn in the Bible===
In [[Judeo-Christian]] tradition, the word or concept of jinn as such does not occur in the original Hebrew text of the Bible, but the Arabic word ''{{transl|ar|DIN|<U+01E7>inn}}'' is often used in several old Arabic translations.

In several verses in those [[Bible translations by language|Arabic]] translations, the words: Jinn ({{lang|ar|<U+062C><U+0646>}}) Jann ({{lang|ar|<U+0627><U+0644><U+062C><U+0627><U+0646>}} ''{{transl|ar|DIN|al-<U+01E6><U+0101>n}}'') Majnoon ({{lang|ar|<U+0645><U+062C><U+0646><U+0648><U+0646>}} ''{{transl|ar|DIN|Ma<U+01E7>n<U+016B>n}}'') and ''{{transl|ar|DIN|<U+02BE>Ibl<U+012B>s}}'' ({{lang|ar|<U+0625><U+0628><U+0644><U+06CC><U+0633>}}) are mentioned as translations of '''familiar spirit''' or <U+05D0><U+05D5><U+05D1> (ob) for Jann and '''the devil''' or {{lang|el|<U+03B4><U+03B1><U+03B9><U+03BC><U+03CC><U+03BD><U+03B9><U+03BF><U+03BD>}} (''daim<U+00F3>nion'') for ''{{transl|ar|DIN|<U+02BE>Ibl<U+012B>s}}''.

In [[Cornelius Van Allen Van Dyck|Van Dyck]]'s Arabic translation of the Bible, these words are mentioned in [[Leviticus]] 19:31, Lev 20:6, [[1 Samuel]] 28:3, 1 Sa 28:9, 1 Sa 28:7, [[1 Chronicles]] 10:13, [[Gospel of Matthew]] 4:1, Mat 12:22, [[Gospel of Luke]] 4:5, Luk 8:12, [[Gospel of John]] 8:44 and other verses{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}} as well. Also, in the [[apocrapha|apocryphal]] book [[Testament of Solomon]], Solomon describes particular [[demon]]s whom he enslaved to help build the [[Solomon's Temple|temple]], the questions he put to them about their deeds and how they could be thwarted, and their answers, which provide a kind of self-help manual against demonic activity.

====Summoning Jinns====
In Muslim cultures, it is believed whether with evidence or not that Jinns can be called and controlled. This meeting usually takes place in a dark room, as Jinns cannot enter a place of light or so believed, and is considered frightening and dangerous. Safety precautions are also needed. A ''fence'' is made by reciting suraahs and inside this fence the caller can stand or sit and can call upon the Jinn.{{fact|date=April 2012}} This fence the Jinn cannot pass and is thus, a safety circle for the caller. Within this fence, the caller can summon the Jinn and ask for what he/she wants. Since there are many types of Jinns, not always does a calm or good Jinn answer the calling. Sometimes, a dangerous Jinn answers the calling and is harder to face if the Jinn decides to try and scare the caller. More than one Jinn can be called, but this is considered risky by those who believe in these callings. There are other ways to call Jinns by offering sweets - which the Jinns are said to love - and calling a Jinn through suraahs in a dark room that makes the caller uneasy. Leaving the sweet there, he/she will leave and go there the next day to see if the sweet is still there. If it is not, then there is a Jinn there and the caller can offer another sweet and remain in the room this time and the Jinn will come and grant wishes - but only materialistic things. However, the consequences are great. If the caller does not offer a sweet each day till the he dies, or misses a single day, then the Jinn will probably harm him. If such meetings do take place, they are not smiled upon by most people of Muslim cultures and are even considered ''harem'' or sinful by many.{{fact|date=April 2012}}

==Protection from Jinn==

An emulate, talisman or what is referred to as a taweez amongst Sufi circles is a form of protection against many forms of spiritual badness including protection against Jinns. It is often worn around the neck hanging close to the heart. One such popular taweez was said to have been given to Sheikh Abdullah Daghistani by Prophet Muhammad in a dream or vision he had. In that vision he was instructed to give this taweez to people as a protection for them as the time of openings was upon us. The tweez is an aerial view of the Divine Court and contains many holy names of Saints and Prophets as well as names of God, including one hidden name that was used by many Prophets to perform great miracles<ref>[http://www.brokenearth.org/protection/index.htm Taweez Description]</ref>. Taweez's have been used throughout history to ward off evil and were widely used amongst the Native American tribes.
