The '''Burmese Border loach''', '''angelicus loach''' or '''polka dot loach''', ''Botia kubotai'', is a recently described species that has quickly become a popular [[tropical]] [[fish]] for [[freshwater]] [[aquarium]]s. In 2002, fish collectors working in western [[Thailand]] began to expand their search into [[Myanmar]] ([[Burma]]) area from the [[Three Pagodas Pass]] Thai-Myanmar border to look for new fish for the aquarium trade.  This is one of several species discovered and explains the origin of the fish's common name: Burmese Border Loach.<ref>[http://web.archive.org/web/20050210133906/www.loaches.com/species_pages/botia_sp_myanmar.html Loaches Online - Botia kubotai, retrieved May 2005] (web.archive.org)</ref> Its specific epithet honors Katsuma Kubota of an aquarium export company in Thailand who first purchased the catch and sent them out for identification.

==Habitat and appearance==
[[Image:Botia kubotai3.jpg|thumb|left|Juvenile Botia kubotai]]The fish, a [[bottom feeder]], is found in the [[Salween River]] system which is mostly in Myanmar. It was first discovered in [[Ataran River]]<ref>Kottelat, M. ''Botia kubotai, a new species of loach (Teleostei: Cobitidae) from the Ataran River basin (Myanmar), with comments on botiine nomenclature and diagnosis of a new genus''. Zootaxa 401:1-18., 2004.</ref> (known in Thailand as Kasat River), a tributary of Salween River. A population in Thailand was discovered in early 2006 in another tributary of Salween River, Suriya River in [[Thungyai Naresuan Wildlife Sanctuary]].<ref>Nonn Panitvong, ''<U+0E01><U+0E32><U+0E23><U+0E1C><U+0E08><U+0E0D><U+0E20><U+0E31><U+0E22><U+0E2A><U+0E38><U+0E14><U+0E02><U+0E2D><U+0E1A><U+0E0A><U+0E32><U+0E22><U+0E41><U+0E14><U+0E19> <U+0E17><U+0E35><U+0E48><U+0E41><U+0E21><U+0E48><U+0E19><U+0E49><U+0E33><U+0E2A><U+0E38><U+0E23><U+0E34><U+0E22><U+0E30>'' ''(Adventure to the Extreme Border at Suriya River)'', Aqua Vol. 4 No. 43, 15 April - 15 May 2006</ref> It grows as large as 15 cm in length, but most tend to be smaller at around 10 cm.  It has gold, black, and grey colors arranged in a pattern that varies greatly depending on the age of the fish. Juvenile fish at about 2.5 cm are very similar to ''[[Botia histrionica]]''.  It has yellow body with only black vertical bands. Typically around this size grey dots on the black bands together with a middle horizontal bar joining the bands begin to appear.  At about 5 cm, the top and bottom part of the vertical bands start to merge, producing a pattern of big yellow ovals along the body.  More grey dots continue to appear as fish grows.

==In aquarium==
This fish, like most other loach species, should be kept in groups when placed in an aquarium. Suitable water parameters are 25 - 30 <U+00B0>C, [[pH]] 6.5 to 6.9, [[dGH]] 0 to 8.0. Lots of hiding places should also be provided. Newly purchased, it is a good idea to treat them for internal [[parasite]]s, a very common problem for wild-caught bottom feeder fishes.

Botia kubotai is omnivorous and will accept most food types offered to freshwater fish including snails, small shrimp, sinking pellets, [[Chironomidae#Behavior and description|blood worm]]s, and black worms.
