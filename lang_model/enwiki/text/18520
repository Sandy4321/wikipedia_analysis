The [[Pleiad]] '''Electra''' {{IPA|/<U+026A><U+02C8>l<U+025B>ktr<U+0259>/}} of [[Greek mythology]] was one of the seven daughters of [[Atlas (mythology)|Atlas]] and [[Pleione (mythology)|Pleione]]. These [[Pleiades (mythology)|seven sisters]] are associated with the [[Pleiades (star cluster)|Pleiades]] [[open cluster|star cluster]]. 

Electra was the wife of [[Corythus]]. She was raped by [[Zeus]] and gave birth to [[Dardanus]], who became the founder of [[Troy]], ancestor of [[Priam]] and his house. According to one legend, she was the lost Pleiade, disappearing in grief after the destruction of Troy. This hypothesis is not proven.

She was called Atlantis by [[Ovid]], personifying the family of Pleiades. 

Electra means "amber," "shining," and "bright."
