'''Maya stelae''' (singular '''''stela''''') are monuments that were fashioned by the [[Maya civilization]] of ancient [[Mesoamerica]]. They consist of tall sculpted stone shafts and are often associated with low circular stones referred to as altars, although their actual function is uncertain.<ref name="Miller99p9">Miller 1999, p.9.</ref> Many [[stele|stelae]] were sculpted in low [[relief]],<ref name="Fuente&c99p187">Fuente et al 1999, p.187.</ref> although plain monuments are found throughout the Maya region.<ref name="Stuart96p149">Stuart 1996, p.149.</ref> The sculpting of these monuments spread throughout the Maya area during the [[Mesoamerican chronology#Classic Era|Classic Period]] (250<U+2013>900 AD),<ref name="Miller99p9"/> and these pairings of sculpted stelae and circular altars are considered a hallmark of Classic Maya civilization.<ref>Sharer & Traxler 2006, p.235.</ref> The earliest dated stela to have been found ''[[in situ]]'' in the Maya lowlands was recovered from the great city of [[Tikal]] in [[Guatemala]].<ref>Miller 1999, p.88. Olmedo Vera 1999, p.24.</ref> During the Classic Period almost every Maya kingdom in the southern lowlands raised stelae in its ceremonial centre.<ref name="Stuart96p149"/>

Stelae became closely associated with the concept of [[Imperial cult|divine kingship]] and declined at the same time as this institution. The production of stelae by the [[Maya peoples|Maya]] had its origin around 400&nbsp;BC and continued through to the end of the Classic Period, around 900, although some monuments were reused in the [[Mesoamerican chronology#Postclassic Era|Postclassic]] (c. 900<U+2013>1521). The major city of [[Calakmul]] in [[Mexico]] raised the greatest number of stelae known from any Maya city, at least 166, although they are very poorly preserved.<ref name="Drew99p222">Drew 1999, p.222.</ref>

Hundreds of stelae have been recorded in the Maya region,<ref>Stewart 2009, p.8.</ref> displaying a wide stylistic variation.<ref name="Stuart96p149"/> Many are upright slabs of [[limestone]] sculpted on one or more faces,<ref name="Stuart96p149"/> with available surfaces sculpted with figures carved in relief and with [[Maya script|hieroglyphic text]].<ref name="Fuente&c99p187"/> Stelae in a few sites display a much more three dimensional appearance where locally available stone permits, such as at [[Cop<U+00E1>n]] and [[Tonin<U+00E1>]].<ref name="Stuart96p149"/> Plain stelae do not appear to have been painted nor overlaid with [[stucco]] decoration,<ref name="Stuart96p158">Stuart 1996, p.158.</ref> but most Maya stelae were probably brightly painted in red, yellow, black, blue and other colours.<ref name="SharerTraxler06p183"/>

Stelae were essentially stone [[banner]]s raised to glorify the king and record his deeds,<ref name=Borowicz03p217/> although the earliest examples depict [[Maya mythology|mythological]] scenes.<ref name="MillerTaube03p157"/> Imagery developed throughout the Classic Period, with Early Classic stelae  (c. 250<U+2013>600) displaying non-Maya characteristics from the 4th century onwards, with the introduction of imagery linked to the central Mexican metropolis of [[Teotihuacan]].<ref name="Borowicz03p222-224">Borowicz 2003, pp.222&ndash;224.</ref> This influence receded in the 5th century although some minor Teotihuacan references continued to be used.<ref name="Borowicz03p227">Borowicz 2003, p.227.</ref> In the late 5th century, Maya kings began to use stelae to mark the end of [[Maya calendar|calendrical cycles]].<ref>Sharer & Traxler 2006, p.754. Borowicz 2003, p.230.</ref> In the Late Classic (c. 600<U+2013>900), imagery linked to the [[Mesoamerican ballgame]] was introduced, once again displaying influence from central Mexico.<ref name="Cohodas91p279-280">Cohodas 1991, pp.279&ndash;280.</ref> By the [[Classic Maya collapse|Terminal Classic]], the institution of divine kingship declined, and Maya kings began to be depicted with their subordinate lords.<ref name="SharerTraxler06p500-501">Sharer & Traxler 2006, pp.500&ndash;501.</ref> As the Classic Period came to an end, stelae ceased to be erected, with the last known examples being raised in 909<U+2013>910.<ref>Sharer & Traxler 2006, pp.471, 476, 500. Fuente et al 1999, p.186.</ref>

==Function==
The function of the Maya stela was central to the [[ideology]] of [[Maya rulers|Maya kingship]] from the very beginning of the Classic Period through to the very end of the Terminal Classic (800<U+2013>900).<ref>Newsome 1993, 1996, p.1.</ref> The [[hieroglyph]]ic inscriptions on the stelae of the Classic period site of [[Piedras Negras (Maya site)|Piedras Negras]] played a key part in the decipherment of the script, with stelae being grouped around seven different structures and each group appearing to chart the life of a particular individual, with key dates being celebrated, such as birth, marriage and military victories. From these stelae, [[Epigraphy|epigrapher]] [[Tatiana Proskouriakoff]] was able to identify that they contained details of royal rulers and their associates, rather than [[Maya priesthood|priests]] and [[List of Maya gods and supernatural beings|gods]] as had previously been theorised.<ref name="Coe99p224">Coe 1999, p.224.</ref>

[[File:DosPilas1.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Detail of a stela from [[Arroyo de Piedra]], later reused at [[Dos Pilas]]<ref>Demarest 2006, pp.139&ndash;140.</ref>|alt=Relief sculpture of an elaborately dressed figure facing right, wearing an intricate headdress and cradling a staff in one arm.]]
Epigrapher [[David Stuart (Mayanist)|David Stuart]] first proposed that the Maya regarded their stelae as ''te tun'', "stone trees", although he later revised his reading to ''lakamtun'', meaning "banner stone",<ref>Miller 1999, pp.78, 80.</ref> from ''lakam'' meaning "banner" in several [[Mayan languages]] and ''tun'' meaning "stone".<ref name="Stuart96p154">Stuart 1996, p.154.</ref> According to Stuart this may refer to the stelae as stone versions of vertical standards that once stood in prominent places in Maya city centres, as depicted in ancient Maya [[Graffito (archaeology)|graffiti]].<ref name="Stuart96p154"/> The name of the modern [[Lacandon]] Maya is likely to be a [[Spanish colonization of the Americas|Colonial]] corruption of this word.<ref>Stuart 1996, p.154.n7.</ref>

Maya stelae were often arranged to impress the viewer, forming lines or other arrangements within the ceremonial centre of the city. Maya cities with a history of [[sculpture|stonecarving]] that extended back into the Early Classic preferred to pair their stelae with a circular altar, which may have represented a cut tree trunk and have been used to perform [[Sacrifice in Maya culture|human sacrifice]], given the prevalence of sacrificial imagery on such monuments.<ref name="Miller99p80">Miller 1999, p.80.</ref> An alternative interpretation of these "altars" is that they were in fact thrones that were used by rulers during ceremonial events.<ref>Sharer & Traxler 2006, p.171.</ref> Archaeologists believe that they probably also served as ritual pedestals for [[censer|incense burners]], ceremonial fires and other offerings.<ref name="Stuart96p149"/>

The core purpose of a stela was to glorify the king.<ref name="Borowicz03p217">Borowicz 2003, p.217.</ref> Many Maya stelae depict only the king of the city, and describe his actions with [[Maya script|hieroglyphic script]]. Even when the individual depicted is not the king himself, the text or scene usually relates the subject to the king.<ref name="Miller99p150">Miller 1999, p.150.</ref> Openly declaring the importance and power of the king to the community, the stela portrayed his wealth, prestige and ancestry, and depicted him wielding the symbols of military and divine power.<ref name="Borowicz03p217"/> Stelae were raised to commemorate important events, especially at the end of a ''[[k'atun]]'' 20-year cycle of the [[Mesoamerican Long Count calendar|Maya calendar]], or to mark a quarter or a half ''k'atun''.<ref>Sharer & Traxler 2006, p.149.</ref> The stela did not just mark off a period of time, it physically embodied that period of time.<ref name="Stuart96p165">Stuart 1996, p.165.</ref> The hieroglyphic texts on the stelae describe how some of the calendrical ceremonies required the king to perform ritual [[Maya dance|dance]] and [[Bloodletting in Mesoamerica|bloodletting]].<ref name="Stuart96p149"/> At [[Tikal]], the [[twin pyramid groups]] were built to celebrate the ''k'atun'' ending and reflected [[Maya religion#Cosmology|Maya cosmology]]. These groups possessed [[Mesoamerican pyramids|pyramids]] on the east and west sides that represented the birth and death of the sun. On the south side, a nine-doored building was situated in order to represent the [[Xibalba|underworld]]. On the north side was a walled enclosure that represented the celestial region; it was left open to the sky. It was in this celestial enclosure that a stela-altar pair was placed, the altar being a fitting throne for the divine king.<ref name="SharerTraxler06p731">Sharer & Traxler 2006, p.731.</ref> Calakmul practised a tradition that was unusual in the Maya area, that of raising twin stelae depicting both the king and his wife.<ref name="Drew99p222"/>

The [[iconography]] of stelae remained reasonably stable during the Classic Period, since the effectiveness of the propaganda message of the monument relied upon its symbolism being clearly recognisable to the viewer.<ref name="Borowicz03p217"/> However, at times a shift in the sociopolitical climate induced a change in iconography.<ref>Borowicz 2003, pp.217&ndash;218.</ref> Stelae were an ideal format for public propaganda since, unlike earlier [[Maya architecture|architectural]] sculpture, they were personalised to a specific king, could be arranged in public spaces and were portable, allowing them to be moved and reset in a new location. An important feature of stelae was that they were able to survive different phases of architectural construction, unlike architectural sculpture itself.<ref name="Borowicz03p218">Borowicz 2003, p.218.</ref> With the ability to portray an identifiable ruler bearing elite goods, accompanied by hieroglyphic text and carrying out actions in service of the kingdom, stelae became one of the most effective ways of delivering public propaganda in the [[Maya lowlands]].<ref name="Borowicz03p219">Borowicz 2003, p.219.</ref> In 7th-century [[Cop<U+00E1>n]], king [[Chan Imix K'awiil]] raised a series of seven stelae that marked the boundary of the most fertile land in the Cop<U+00E1>n valley, an area of approximately {{convert|25|to|30|km2|sqmi}}.<ref>Webster 2002, pp.164&ndash;165.</ref> As well as marking the boundary, they defined the sacred geometry of the city and referred to important seats of deities in the ceremonial centre of the Cop<U+00E1>n.<ref>Fash & Agurcia Fasquelle 2005, p.28. Schele & Looper 2005, p.365.</ref>

===Ritual significance===
{{Maya civilization}}
Stelae were considered to be invested with holiness and to contain a divine soul-like essence that almost made them living beings.<ref name="Stuart96p157">Stuart 1996, p.157.</ref> Some were given individual names in hieroglyphic texts and were considered to be participants in rituals conducted at their location.<ref>Stuart 1996, p.151.</ref> Such rituals in the Classic Period appear to have included the [[k'altun binding ritual|''k'altun'' binding ritual]], in which the stela was wrapped in bands of tied [[Maya textiles|cloth]].<ref name="Stuart96p156">Stuart 1996, p.156.</ref> This ritual was closely tied to the ''k'atun''-ending calendrical ceremony.<ref>Stuart 1996, pp.156&ndash;158.</ref> A ''k'altun'' ritual is depicted carved onto a [[peccary]] skull deposited as a funerary offering at Cop<U+00E1>n, the scene shows two nobles flanking a stela-altar pair where the stela has been bound with cloth.<ref name="Stuart96p156"/> The act of wrapping or binding a sacred object was of considerable [[Maya religion|religious]] importance across Mesoamerica, and is well attested among the Maya right up to the present day. The precise meaning of the act is not clear, but may be to protect the bound object or to contain its sacred essence. The binding of stelae may be linked to the modern [[K'iche' people|K'iche' Maya]] practice of wrapping small divinatory stones in a bundle.<ref name="Stuart96p157"/>

A stela was not just considered a neutral portrait, it was considered to be owned by the subject, whether that subject was a person or a god. Stela&nbsp;3 from El&nbsp;Zapote in Guatemala is a small monument dating from the Early Classic period, the front of the stela bears a portrait of the rain god [[Chaac|Yaxhal Chaak]], "Clear Water Chaak".<ref name="Stuart96p158-159">Stuart 1996, pp.158&ndash;159.</ref> The accompanying text describes how the deity Yaxhal Chaak himself was dedicated, not just his image on the stela.<ref>Stuart 1996, p.159.</ref> This seems to imply that the stela was seen as the embodiment of the deity and is also true of those stelae bearing royal portraits, which were seen to be the supernatural embodiment of the ruler they represented.<ref>Stuart 1996, pp.160, 164.</ref> The stela, combined with any accompanying altar, was a perpetual enactment of royal ceremony in stone.<ref>Stuart 1996, p.160.</ref> David Stuart has stated that stelae "do not simply commemorate past events and royal ceremonies but serve to perpetuate the ritual act into eternity".<ref name="Stuart96p165"/> Stelae bearing royal portraits were extensions of the royal "self" and were a powerful confirmation of political and religious authority.<ref>Stuart 1996, p.167.</ref> Stelae bearing images of multiple people, for instance of several nobles performing a ritual or of a king with his [[Maya warfare|war]] captives, were likely to be exceptions to this idea of the stela as sacred embodiment of the subject.<ref name="Stuart96p165"/>

At times, when a new king came to power, old stelae would be respectfully buried and replaced with new ones, or they might be broken.<ref>Webster 2002, p.154.</ref> When a Maya city was invaded by a rival, it was pillaged by the victors. One of the most striking archaeological markers of such an invasion is the destruction of the defeated city's stelae, which were broken and cast down.<ref name="SharerTraxler06p300">Sharer & Traxler 2006, p.300.</ref> At the end of the Preclassic, around 150 AD, this fate appears to have befallen the important city of [[El Mirador]], where most of the stelae were found smashed.<ref>Drew 1999, p.145.</ref>

==Manufacture==
[[File:Stela18TakalikAbaj.jpg|thumb|upright|A typical stela-altar pairing from [[Takalik Abaj]], both of them being plain monuments|alt=A tall plain standing stone behind a cog-shaped flat stone, in a grassy area with a jungle-covered mound rising behind.]]
Royal artisans were sometimes responsible for sculpting stelae; in some cases these sculptors were actually the sons of kings.<ref>Webster 2002, p.158.</ref> In other cases it is likely that captive artisans from defeated cities were put to work raising stelae for the victors, as evidenced by the sculptural style of one city appearing upon monuments of its conqueror soon after its defeat. This appears to have been the case in Piedras Negras where Stela&nbsp;12 depicting war captives submitting to the victorious king is carved in the style of [[Pomon<U+00E1>]], the defeated city. Archaeologists believe that this may also have been the case with [[Quirigu<U+00E1>]] after its surprise defeat of its overlord Cop<U+00E1>n.<ref name="Drew99p285">Drew 1999, p.285.</ref>

Stelae were usually crafted from quarried [[limestone]], although in the [[Southern Maya area]] other types of stone were preferred.<ref name="Miller99p81-82">Miller 1999, pp.81&ndash;82.</ref> Volcanic [[tuff]] was used at Cop<U+00E1>n to craft their stelae in three dimensions.<ref name="Miller99p82">Miller 1999, p.82.</ref> Both limestone and tuff were easily worked when first quarried and hardened with exposure to the elements.<ref name="Miller99p81-82"/> At Quirigu<U+00E1> a hard red [[sandstone]] was used that was unable to reproduce the three-dimensionality of Cop<U+00E1>n but was of sufficient strength that the kings of the city were able to raise the tallest free-standing stone monuments in the [[Americas]].<ref name="Miller99p82"/> The Maya lacked beasts of burden and did not employ the wheel;<ref>Drew 1999, p.15.</ref> therefore the freshly quarried blocks of stone had to be transported on rollers along the [[Sacbe|Maya causeways]]. Evidence of this has been found on the causeways themselves, where rollers have been recovered.<ref name="ClarkWernecke05p155">Clark Wernecke 2005, p.155.</ref> The blocks were sculpted to their final form while still soft and they then hardened naturally with time.<ref name="SharerTraxler06p183">Sharer & Traxler 2006, p.183.</ref> Stone was usually quarried locally but was occasionally transported over great distances.<ref name="Miller99p82"/> [[Calakmul]] in [[Mexico]] was one of two powerful cities that shaped the political landscape of the Classic Period, the other being Tikal.<ref>Webster 2002, pp.168&ndash;169.</ref> It imported black [[slate]] for one stela from the [[Maya Mountains]], more than {{convert|320|km|mi}} away.<ref name="Miller99p82"/> Although Calakmul raised the greatest number of stelae known from any Maya city, they were sculpted from poor quality limestone and have suffered severe erosion, rendering most of them illegible.<ref name="Drew99p222"/> Stelae could be of substantial size; Quirigu<U+00E1> Stela&nbsp;E measures {{convert|10.6|m|ft}} from the base to the top, including the {{convert|3|m|ft|adj=on}} buried portion holding it in place.<ref name="Looper03p147">Looper 2003, p.147.</ref> This particular monument has a claim to being the largest free-standing stone monument in the [[New World]] and weighs about {{convert|59|t|ST|abbr=none}}.<ref>Looper 2003, p.147. Coe 1999, p.121.</ref> Stela&nbsp;1 at [[Ixkun]] is one of the tallest monuments in the [[Pet<U+00E9>n Basin]], measuring {{convert|4.13|m|ft}} high, not including the buried portion, and is roughly {{convert|2|m|ft}} wide and {{convert|0.39|m|ft}} thick.<ref>Laporte & Torres 1988, p.12. Laporte & Torres 1994, p.131. Laporte et al 2005, p.163.</ref>

Maya stelae were worked with stone chisels and probably with wooden mallets. [[Hammerstone]]s were fashioned from [[flint]] and [[basalt]] and were used for shaping the softer rocks used to make stelae, while fine detail was completed with smaller chisels. Originally most were probably brightly painted in red, yellow, black, blue and other colours using mineral and organic [[pigment]]s. At Cop<U+00E1>n and some other Maya cities, some traces of these pigments were found upon the monuments.<ref name="SharerTraxler06p183"/>

Generally all sides of a stela were sculpted with human figures and hieroglyphic text, with each side forming a part of a single composition.<ref name="Fuente&c99p187"/> Undecorated stelae in the form of plain slabs or columns of stone are found throughout the Maya region.<ref name="Stuart96p149"/> These appear never to have been painted or to have been decorated overlaid [[stucco]] sculpture.<ref name="Stuart96p158"/>

The Maya sculptural tradition that produced the stelae emerged fully formed and had probably been preceded by sculpted wooden monuments.<ref name="Miller99p78">Miller 1999, p.78.</ref> However the tradition of raising stelae had its origin elsewhere in Mesoamerica, among the [[Olmec]]s of the [[Gulf Coast of Mexico]]. In the Late [[Mesoamerican chronology#Preclassic Era or Formative Period|Preclassic]] it then spread into the [[Isthmus of Tehuantepec]] and southwards along the [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific Coast]] to sites such as [[Chiapa de Corzo (Mesoamerican site)|Chiapa de Corzo]], [[Izapa]] and [[Takalik Abaj]] where [[Mesoamerican Long Count calendar]] dates began to be carved onto the stelae. Although at Izapa the stelae depicted mythological scenes, at Takalik Abaj they began to show rulers in Early Classic Maya posture accompanied by calendrical dates and hieroglyphic texts. It was also at Takalik Abaj and Izapa that these stelae began to be paired with circular altars.<ref name="MillerTaube03p157">Miller & Taube 2003, p.157.</ref> By approximately 400&nbsp;BC, near the end of the Middle Preclassic Period, early Maya rulers were raising stelae that celebrated their achievements and validated their right to rule.<ref>Sharer & Traxler 2006, pp.182, 197.</ref> At [[El Port<U+00F3>n|El&nbsp;Port<U+00F3>n]] in the [[Salam<U+00E1>]] Valley of [[Guatemalan Highlands|highland Guatemala]] a carved [[schist]] stela (Monument&nbsp;1) was erected, the badly eroded [[hieroglyph]]s appear to be a very early form of Maya writing and may even be the earliest known example of Maya script. It was associated with a plain altar in a typical stela-altar pairing that would become common across the Maya area.<ref name="SharerTraxler06p197">Sharer & Traxler 2006, p.197.</ref> Stela&nbsp;11 at [[Kaminaljuyu]], a major Preclassic highland city, dates to the Middle Preclassic and is the earliest stela to depict a standing ruler. The sculpted Preclassic stelae from Kaminaljuyu and other cities in the region, such as [[Chalchuapa]] in [[El Salvador|El&nbsp;Salvador]] and [[Chocol<U+00E1>]] in the Pacific lowlands, tend to depict [[Maya politics|political]] succession, [[Sacrifice in Maya culture|sacrifice]] and [[Maya warfare|warfare]].<ref name="SharerTraxler06p246">Sharer & Traxler 2006, p.246.</ref>

At the Middle Preclassic city of [[Nakbe]] in the central lowlands, Maya sculptors were producing some of the earliest lowland Maya stelae, depicting richly dressed individuals.<ref>Webster 2002, p.189.</ref> Nakbe Stela&nbsp;1 has been dated to around 400&nbsp;BC. It was broken into pieces, but originally represented two elaborately dressed figures facing each other, and perhaps represents the transference of power from one ruler to his successor, however it also has features that recall the myth of the [[Maya Hero Twins]], and would be the earliest known presentation of them.<ref name="Drew99p129-130">Drew 1999, pp.129&ndash;130.</ref> Around 200&nbsp;BC the enormous nearby city of [[El Mirador|El&nbsp;Mirador]]  had started to erect stela-like monuments, bearing inscriptions that appear to be glyphs but that are so far unreadable.<ref>Webster 2002, p.188.</ref> A stela has also been discovered at [[El Tintal|El&nbsp;Tintal]], another major Preclassic city in the Mirador Basin.<ref name="JustesonMathews83p586">Justeson & Mathews 1983, p.586.</ref> 

On the Pacific Coast [[El Ba<U+00FA>l|El&nbsp;Ba<U+00FA>l]] Stela&nbsp;1 features a date in its hieroglyphic text that equates to 36 AD.<ref>Drew 1999, p.144.</ref> It depicts a ruler bearing a sceptre or a spear with a double column of hieroglyphic text before him.<ref name="SharerTraxler06p246"/> At Takalik Abaj are two stelae (Stela&nbsp;2 and Stela&nbsp;5) depicting the transfer of power from one ruler to another; they both show two elaborately dressed figures facing each other with  a column of hieroglyphic text between them.<ref>Sharer & Traxler 2006, p.248.</ref> The Long Count date on Stela&nbsp;2 dates it to the 1st century&nbsp;BC at the latest,<ref>Sharer 2000, p.467.</ref> while Stela&nbsp;5 has two dates, the latest of which is 126 AD.<ref>Sharer 2000, p.468.</ref> The stela was associated with the burial of a [[human sacrifice]] and other offerings.<ref name="JustesonMathews83p586"/> Stela&nbsp;13 at Takalik Abaj also dates to the Late Preclassic; a massive offering of more than 600 [[Maya ceramics|ceramic]] vessels was found at its base, together with 33 [[Obsidian use in Mesoamerica|obsidian]] [[prismatic blade]]s and other [[Artifact (archaeology)|artefacts]]. Both the stela and the offering were associated with a nearby Late Preclassic [[Takalik Abaj#Royal burial|royal tomb]].<ref>Schieber de Lavarreda 2003, p.784. Crasborn 2005, p.697.</ref> At [[Cuello]] in Belize, a plain stela was raised around 100 AD in an open plaza.<ref name="JustesonMathews83p586"/>

At the very end of the Preclassic Period, around 100<U+2013>300 AD, cities in the highlands and along the Pacific Coast ceased to raise sculpted stelae bearing hieroglyphic texts.<ref>Sharer & Traxler 2006, pp.279&ndash;280.</ref> This cessation in the production of stelae was the most dramatic symptom of a general decline in the region at this time. This decline has been linked to the intrusion of peoples from the western highlands combined with the disastrous eruption of the [[Lake Ilopango|Ilopango Volcano]] that severely affected the entire region.<ref name="SharerTraxler06p280">Sharer & Traxler 2006, p.280.</ref>

===Early Classic===

In the central [[Pet<U+00E9>n Basin|Pet<U+00E9>n]] lowlands, the rise of individual rule at cities like Tikal required the development of new forms of public imagery. Preclassic imagery had involved largely anonymous, impersonal sculpture as an [[Maya architecture|architectural]] element. The existing Preclassic Pet<U+00E9>n styles of architectural sculpture were combined with features of the highland and Pacific Coast tradition to produce the Early Classic Maya stela.<ref name="Borowicz03p218"/> Features formerly found on architectural sculpture, such as the giant masks adorning Preclassic pyramids, were adapted for use on stelae. For example, the so-called "[[Maya Jester God|Jester God]]" was transferred to the headdress of the ruler portrayed on Tikal Stela&nbsp;29,<ref name="Borowicz03p219"/> which bears the oldest Long Count date yet found in the Maya lowlands <U+2013> equating to 292 AD.<ref>Olmedo Vera 1999, p.24.</ref>  At some Maya cities the first appearance of stelae corresponded with the foundation of [[Dynasty|dynastic rule]].<ref name="Borowicz03p217"/>

The standard form of the Maya stela incorporating art, calendrical dates and hieroglyphic text onto a royal monument only began to be erected in the Maya lowlands after 250 AD.<ref>Webster 2002, p.119.</ref> The late 4th century saw the introduction of non-Maya imagery linked to the giant metropolis of [[Teotihuacan]] in the [[Valley of Mexico]].<ref name="Borowicz03p222-224"/> This foreign influence is seen at Tikal, [[Uaxactun]], [[R<U+00ED>o Azul]] and [[El Zapote|El&nbsp;Zapote]], all in the [[Pet<U+00E9>n Department]] of Guatemala. At Tikal this was initiated by the king [[Yax Nuun Ayiin I|Yax&nbsp;Nuun&nbsp;Ayiin&nbsp;I]], from there it spread to his vassal cities.<ref name="Borowicz03p224">Borowicz 2003, p.224.</ref> In the 5th century, this strongly Teotihuacan-linked imagery was abandoned by Yax&nbsp;Nuun&nbsp;Ayiin&nbsp;I's son [[Siyaj Chan K'awiil II|Siyaj&nbsp;Chan&nbsp;K'awiil&nbsp;II]], who reintroduced imagery associated with the Pacific Coast and adjacent highlands.<ref>Borowicz 2003, p.226.</ref> Minor references to Teotihuacan continued, for example in the form of Teotihuacan war emblems.<ref name="Borowicz03p227"/> His Stela&nbsp;31 was originally erected in 445 but was later broken from its butt and was found buried in the city centre, almost directly above his tomb.<ref>Drew 1999, p.195. Sharer & Traxler 2006, p.303. Miller 1999, p.96.</ref> It depicts the crowning of Siyaj&nbsp;Chan&nbsp;K'awiil&nbsp;II, with his father hovering above him as a supernatural being and is executed in traditional Maya style.<ref>Drew 1999, pp.195&ndash;196.</ref> On the sides of the stela are carved two portraits of his father in a non-Maya style, dressed as a Teotihuacan warrior, bearing the central Mexican [[atlatl]] spear-thrower not adopted by the Maya, and carrying a shield adorned with the face of the Mexican god Tlaloc.<ref>Drew 1999, p.196. Martin & Grube 2000, p.35.</ref> The reverse of the stela bears a lengthy hieroglyphic inscription detailing the history of Tikal, including the [[Tikal#Tikal and Teotihuacan|Teotihuacan invasion]] that established Yax Nuun Ayiin I and his dynasty.<ref>Martin & Grube 2000, p.34.</ref>

In the Early Classic period the Maya kings began to dedicate a new stela, or other monument, to mark the end of each ''k'atun'' cycle (representing 7,200 days, just under 20 [[sidereal year]]s).<ref>Sharer & Traxler 2006, p.754.</ref> At Tikal, the first to do so was king [[Kan Chitam]] who ruled in the late 5th century. Stela&nbsp;9 from the city is the first dated monument raised to mark off a period of time, it was raised in 475.<ref name="Borowicz03p230">Borowicz 2003, p.230.</ref>

===Late Classic===
[[File:Quirigu<U+00E1>Glyphs1.jpg|thumb|upright|Hieroglyphic text on the side of Stela E at Quirigu<U+00E1>|alt=The side of a stela, divided into square panels containing sculpted heieroglyphs]]
In the Late Classic the sculpted images of rulers on stelae remained much the same as in the Early Classic, appearing in profile in the foreground and filling almost the entire available space, which is delimited by a frame.<ref>Fuente et al 1999, p.189.</ref> Imagery associated with the [[Mesoamerican ballgame]] started to appear in the Maya lowlands in the Late Classic Period.<ref name="Cohodas91p279-280"/> Maya kings are depicted as warriors wearing costume from the Mexican highlands, including elements such as the foreign god [[Tlaloc]] and the [[Feathered Serpent (deity)|Teotihacan serpent]]. Such imagery appears in the Late Classic on stelae from [[Naranjo]], [[Piedras Negras (Maya site)|Piedras Negras]] and the [[Petexbat<U+00FA>n]] cities of [[Dos Pilas]] and [[Aguateca]]. At Dos Pilas, a pair of stelae represent the king of the city in costume forming a [[Jaguars in Mesoamerican culture|jaguar]] and eagle pairing, characteristic of the Mexican warrior cult.<ref name="Cohodas91p280">Cohodas, 1991, p.280.</ref> Stelae were being erected by the Maya across the entire central and southern Maya lowlands by 790, an area that encompassed {{convert|150000|km2|sqmi}}.<ref>Webster 2002, p.185.</ref>

In the north, [[Coba]] on the eastern side of the [[Yucat<U+00E1>n Peninsula]] raised at least 23 large stelae. Although badly eroded their style and texts link them to cities from the Pet<U+00E9>n Basin.<ref name="Drew99p362">Drew 1999, p.362.</ref> At the southern periphery of the Maya region, Cop<U+00E1>n developed a new high-[[relief]] style of stelae and in 652 the twelfth king [[Chan Imix K'awiil|Chan&nbsp;Imix&nbsp;K'awiil]] arranged a series of these stelae to define the sacred geometry of the city, and to celebrate his royal rule and his ancestors.<ref>Fash & Agurcia Fasquelle 2005, p.28. Webster 2002, pp.164&ndash;165.</ref> His son and successor [[Uaxaclajuun Ub'aah K'awiil|Uaxaclajuun&nbsp;Ub'aah&nbsp;K'awiil]] further developed this new high-relief style of sculpture and erected a series of intricately decorated stelae in the city's Great Plaza that brought the carving of stelae close to full in-the-round three dimensional sculpture.<ref>Fash & Agurcia Fasquelle 2005, p.28. Andrews & Fash 2005, p.424.</ref> Both of these kings focused on their own images on their stelae and emphasised their place in the dynastic sequence to justify their rule, possibly linked to a break in the dynastic sequence with the death of the eleventh king of Cop<U+00E1>n.<ref>Andrews & Fash 2005, p.424.</ref>

After [[Quirigu<U+00E1>]] defeated its overlord Cop<U+00E1>n in 738, it brought massive blocks of red sandstone from quarries {{convert|5|km|mi}} from the city and sculpted a series of enormous stelae that were the biggest [[Monolithic column|monolithic monuments]] ever raised by the Maya.<ref>Drew 1999, p.241. Webster 2002, p.300.</ref> Stela&nbsp;E stands over {{convert|10|m|ft}} high and weighs more than 60 tons. These stelae were shaped into a square cross-section and were decorated on all four faces. These stelae usually bear two images of the Quirigu<U+00E1> king, on the front and the back, in a lower relief than that found at Cop<U+00E1>n.<ref name="Drew99p241">Drew 1999, p.241.</ref> They feature highly complex panels of hieroglyphic text that are among the most skillfully executed of all Maya inscriptions in stone. The stelae have weathered well and display fine precision on the part of the sculptors.<ref name="Drew99p242">Drew 1999, p.242.</ref>

===Terminal Classic===

The decline in the erection of stelae is linked to the decline in the institution of divine kingship, which began in the Late Preclassic. Originally the stelae depicted the king with symbols of power, sometimes standing over defeated enemies and occasionally accompanied by his wives or his heir.<ref name="SharerTraxler06p500">Sharer & Traxler 2006, p.500.</ref> By the Terminal Classic, kings were sharing stelae with subordinate lords, who also played a prominent role in the events depicted.<ref name="SharerTraxler06p500-501"/> This reflected a decentralisation of power and the bargaining between high-ranking nobles so that the king could maintain power, but led to a progressive weakening of the king's rule. As the position of the king became weaker and that of his vassals and subordinates became stronger, the latter began to erect their own stelae, a function that was formerly the exclusive preserve of the king himself. Some of these subordinates broke away to form their own petty states, but even this did not last and they also ceased to erect monuments.<ref name="SharerTraxler06p501">Sharer & Traxler 2006, p.501.</ref>

In the [[Pasi<U+00F3>n River]] region of Pet<U+00E9>n, rulers began to be portrayed as ballplayers on stelae. [[Seibal]] was the first site in the region to depict its rulers thus.<ref name="Cohodas91p279">Cohodas 1991, p.279.</ref> Seventeen stelae were erected at Seibal between 849 and 889, and show a mix of Maya and foreign styles, including a lord wearing the beaked mask of [[Ehecatl]], the central Mexican wind god, with a Mexican-style [[speech scroll]] emerging from the mouth.  Some of these have a stylistic affinity with the painted murals at [[Cacaxtla]], a non-Maya site in the central [[Political divisions of Mexico|Mexican state]] of [[Tlaxcala]]. This hybrid style seems to indicate that the kings of Seibal were Maya lords adapting to changing political conditions by adopting a mix of symbols originating from both lowland Maya and central Mexican sources.<ref name="SharerTraxler06p522Coe99p154">Sharer & Traxler 2006, p.522. Coe 1999, p.154.</ref> Some of the more foreign-looking stelae even bear non-Maya calendrical glyphs.<ref>Coe 1999, p.154.</ref> Stelae at [[Oxkintok]], to the north in the [[Puuc]] region of the Yucat<U+00E1>n Peninsula, divided the face of the stela into up to three levels, each of which contained a different scene, usually of a lone figure that could be either male or female.<ref>Fuente et al 1999, pp.197&ndash;199.</ref> The representation of the human figure differed from the formal treatment in the south, and were simplified, coarse representations lacking individuality amongst sociopolitical and religious symbols.<ref>Fuente et al 1999, p.198.</ref>

As the [[Classic Maya collapse]] swept across the Maya region, city after city ceased to erect stelae recording its dynastic achievements.<ref name="SharerTraxler06p500"/> At the important city of [[Calakmul]], two stelae were raised in 800 and three more in 810, but these were the last and the city fell into silence.<ref>Martin & Grube 2000, p.115.</ref> At Oxkintok the last stela was raised in 859.<ref>Sharer & Traxler 2006, p.534.</ref> Stela&nbsp;11, dated to 869, was the last monument to ever be erected at the once great city of Tikal.<ref>Martin & Grube 2000, p.53.</ref> The last known Maya stelae bearing a Long Count calendrical date are [[Tonin<U+00E1>]] Monument&nbsp;101, which was erected in 909 to mark the k'atun ending that year,<ref>Sharer & Traxler 2006, pp.471, 476, 500.</ref> and Stela&nbsp;6 from [[Itzimt<U+00E9>]], dated  to 910.<ref>Fuente et al 1999, p.186.</ref>

===Postclassic===
At Cop<U+00E1>n ritual offerings were deposited around the city's stelae until at least 1000, which may represent the offerings of a surviving elite that still remembered its ancestors, or may be due to highland Maya still regarding the city as a place of pilgrimage long after it had fallen into ruin.<ref>Webster 2002, p.311.</ref> At [[Lamanai]] in [[Belize]], Classic period stelae were repositioned upon two small [[Mesoamerican chronology#Postclassic Era|Postclassic]] platforms dating to the 15th or 16th century.<ref>Andres & Pyburn 2005, p.410.</ref> At [[La Milpa, Belize (Maya site)|La Milpa]], also in Belize, at around the time of [[Spanish colonization of the Americas|Spanish contact]] in the late 16th century a tiny remnant Maya population started to make offerings of Conquest-period pottery to stelae, perhaps in an effort to invoke the ancestors to help resist the [[Spanish people|Spanish]] onslaught.<ref>Drew 1999, p.354.</ref>

==Discovery==
One of the earliest accounts of Maya stelae comes from [[Diego Garcia de Palacio]], a Spanish colonial official who described six of the stelae at Cop<U+00E1>n in a letter to king [[Philip II of Spain]] written in 1576.<ref name="Drew99p33">Drew 1999, p.33.</ref> [[Juan Galindo]], governor of Pet<U+00E9>n, visited Cop<U+00E1>n in 1834 and noted the sculpted high-relief stelae there.<ref>Drew 1999, pp.51&ndash;52.</ref> Five years later, American diplomat [[John Lloyd Stephens]] and British artist [[Frederick Catherwood]] arrived in war-torn Central America and set out for Cop<U+00E1>n, describing fifteen stelae in Stephens' ''[[Incidents of Travel in Central America, Chiapas and Yucat<U+00E1>n]]'', published in 1841.<ref>Drew 1999, pp.54&ndash;61, 420, 438.</ref> Stephens and Catherwood noticed the presence of red pigment on some of the Cop<U+00E1>n stelae.<ref>Drew 1999, p.64.</ref> Stephens unsuccessfully attempted to buy the ruins of Quirigu<U+00E1>, and purchased Cop<U+00E1>n for US$50 ($&nbsp;{{formatnum:{{inflation|US|50|1839|r=-2}}}} in {{CURRENTYEAR}}) with the idea of shipping the stelae to [[New York City|New York]] for display in a new museum.<ref>Drew 1999, pp.62&ndash;63.</ref> In the event, he was prevented from shipping the monuments down the [[Cop<U+00E1>n River]] by the discovery of impassable rapids and all the stelae remained at the site.<ref>Drew 1999, p.52.</ref> While Stephens was engaged on business elsewhere, Catherwood carried out a brief investigation of the stelae at Quirigu<U+00E1> but found them very difficult to draw without a [[camera lucida]] due to their great height.<ref>Drew 1999, p.65.</ref> [[Ambrosio Tut]], governor of Pet<U+00E9>n, and colonel [[Modesto M<U+00E9>ndez]], the chief magistrate, visited the ruins of Tikal in 1848 accompanied by [[Eusebio Lara]], who drew some of the monuments there.<ref>Drew 1999, pp.86&ndash;87.</ref> In 1852 Modesto M<U+00E9>ndez went on to discover Stela 1 and Stela 5 at Ixkun.<ref>Laporte et al 2005, pp.163, 208.</ref> English explorer [[Alfred Maudslay]] arrived at Quirigu<U+00E1> in 1881 and cleared the vegetation from the stelae, then travelled on to see the stelae at Cop<U+00E1>n.<ref>Drew 1999, p.89.</ref> In the early 20th century, an expedition by the [[Carnegie Institution for Science|Carnegie Institution]] led by American [[Mayanist]] [[Sylvanus Morley]] discovered a stela at Uaxactun. This period marked a change from the efforts of individual explorers to those of institutions that funded archaeological exploration, excavation and restoration.<ref name="Drew99p98">Drew 1999, p.98.</ref>

==Looting==
Stelae have become threatened in modern times by plundering for sale on the [[international art market]].<ref name="Coggins1972p222">Coggins 1972, p.222.</ref> Many stelae are found in remote areas and their size and weight prevents them from being removed intact. Various methods are used to cut or break a stela for easier transport, including power saws, chisels, acid and heat. When a monument is well preserved, the looters attempt to cut off its face for transport. Even when successful, this results in damage to inscriptions on the sides of the stela. At worst, this method results in complete fragmentation of the stela face with any recoverable sculpture removed for sale. Traceable fragments of well known monuments have been purchased by [[List of museums in the United States|American museums]] and private collectors in the past.<ref name="Coggins1972p223">Coggins 1972, p.223.</ref> When such monuments are removed from their original context, their historical meaning is lost.<ref name="Coggins1972p222"/> Although museums have justified their acquisition of stelae fragments with the argument that such objects are better preserved in an institution, no stela has been sold in as good a condition as it was in its original location. After 1970 there was a sharp drop in Maya stelae available on the [[New York]] art market due to the ratification of a treaty with Mexico that guarantees the return of stolen [[Pre-Columbian era|pre-Columbian]] sculpture that was removed from the country after the ratification date.<ref name="Coggins1972p223"/> In the early 1970s some museums, such as that of the [[University of Pennsylvania]], responded to international criticism by no longer purchasing archaeological artefacts that lack a legally documented history, including place of origin, previous owners and an export license. [[Harvard University]] also instituted a similar policy in the early 1970s.<ref name="Coggins1972p226">Coggins 1972, p.226.</ref>

In 1972, the initially well preserved Stela 5 at Ixkun was smashed into pieces by looters, who heated it until it shattered and then stole various pieces.<ref name="Laporte&c05p208">Laporte et al 2005, p.208.</ref> A number of remaining fragments of the monument were rescued by archaeologist [[Ian Graham]] and transferred to the mayor's office in [[Dolores, El Pet<U+00E9>n|Dolores]], Pet<U+00E9>n, where they were eventually used as construction material before once again being recovered, this time by the [[Atlas Arqueol<U+00F3>gico de Guatemala]] in 1989, and moved to their archaeological laboratory.<ref name="Laporte&c05p208"/>

In 1974, a dealer in pre-Columbian artefacts by the name of Hollinshead arranged for the illegal removal of Machaquil<U+00E1> Stela&nbsp;2 from the Guatemalan jungle. He and his co-conspirators were prosecuted in the United States under the [[National Stolen Property Act of 1934|National Stolen Property Act]] and they were the first people to be convicted under this act with reference to [[national patrimony]] laws.<ref name=Sharma05p757>Sharma 2005, p.757.</ref> The act states:
<blockquote>"whoever transports, transmits, or transfers in interstate or foreign commerce any goods ... of the value of $5,000 or more, knowing the
same to have been stolen, converted or taken by fraud... [s]hall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than ten years, or both... "[w]hoever receives, possesses, conceals, stores, barters, sells, or disposes of any goods .. . which have crossed a State or United States boundary after being stolen, unlawfully converted, or taken, knowing the same to have been stolen, unlawfully converted, or taken (is subject to fine or imprisonment)."<ref>Sharma 2005, pp.756&ndash;757</ref></blockquote>

The act was originally intended to discourage the handling of stolen property but several courts have judged that the National Stolen Property Act is sufficiently broad in scope to apply to goods crossing into the United States from a foreign nation, and is therefore applicable in the case of stolen [[Cultural heritage|cultural property]].<ref name=Sharma05p757/>

Under [[Guatemalan legal system|Guatemalan law]], Maya stelae and other archaeological artefacts are property of the [[Politics of Guatemala|Guatemalan government]] and may not be removed from the country without its permission. In the case of Machaquil<U+00E1> Stela&nbsp;2, the monument was well known before it was stolen and its illegal removal was easy to prove.<ref name=Sharma05p757/> The stela itself was cut into pieces, with the face being sawn off and moved to a fish packing factory in [[Belize]], where it was packed into boxes and shipped to California.<ref>Hughes 1977, p.149. Choc<U+00F3>n & Laporte 2002, p.13.</ref> There it was seized by the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] after being offered for sale to various institutions.<ref name="Hughes77p149"/> The stolen portion of the stela was returned to Guatemala and is now in storage at the Museo Nacional de Arqueolog<U+00ED>a y Etnolog<U+00ED>a in Guatemala City.<ref>Choc<U+00F3>n & Laporte 2002, p.13.</ref>

Looting has been linked to the economic and political stability of the possessing nation, with levels of looting increasing during times of crisis. It also appears that art collectors have stelae, or portions of them, stolen to order by browsing archaeological books and catalogues for desirable pieces. Examples of this may be found at [[Aguateca]] and [[El Per<U+00FA> (Maya site)|El Per<U+00FA>]], both in Guatemala's [[Pet<U+00E9>n Department|Pet<U+00E9>n department]], where only the better preserved hieroglyphs and human faces were cut away.<ref name="Valdes06p98">Vald<U+00E9>s 2006, p.98.</ref>
