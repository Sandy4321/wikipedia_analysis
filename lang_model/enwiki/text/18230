{{nihongo|'''''Nenohi'''''|<U+5B50><U+65E5>|<U+201D>New Year Day<U+201D>}} <ref> Nelson. ''Japanese-English Character Dictionary''. </ref>was the second of six {{sclass|Hatsuharu|destroyer}} [[destroyer]]s, built for the [[Imperial Japanese Navy]] under the [[1st Naval Armaments Supplement Programme (Japan, 1931)|Circle One Program]] (''Maru Ichi Keikaku''). Three were laid down in JFY 1931 and the next three in JFY 1933. The remaining six ships in the plan were built as the {{sclass|Shiratsuyu|destroyer|0}}.<ref>Lengerer, pp. 92-3</ref>  

==History==
Construction of the advanced ''Hatsuharu''-class destroyers was intended to give the Imperial Japanese Navy smaller and more economical destroyers than the previous {{sclass|Fubuki|destroyer|0}} and {{sclass|Akatsuki|destroyer|0}} destroyers, but with essentially the same weaponry. <ref name="global1">GlobalSecurity.org: [http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/japan/hatsuharu-dd.htm IJN ''Hatsuharu'' class]</ref>  These conflicting goals proved beyond contemporary destroyer design, and the resulting ships were top-heavy design, with severe stability problems and with inherent structural weaknesses. After the "Tomozuru Incident" of 1934 and "IJN 4th Fleet Incident" in 1935, ''Nenohi'' underwent extensive modifications on completion to remedy these issues.
The ''Hatsuharu''-class destroyers used the same 50 [[Caliber#Caliber_as_measurement_of_length|caliber]] 12.7&nbsp;cm gun as the ''Fubuki''-class, but all turrets could elevate to 75<U+00B0> to give the main guns a minimal ability to engage aircraft . 

The [[61 cm Type 90 torpedo]] was mounted in triple tube ''Type 90 Model 2'' launchers It was traversed by an electro-hydraulic system and could traverse 360<U+00B0> in twenty-five seconds. If the backup manual system was used, the time required increased to two minutes. Each tube could be reloaded in twenty-three seconds using the endless wire and winch provided.<ref>Lengerer, pp. 102-3</ref>
''Nenohi'' was laid down on December 15, 1931, launched on December 22, 1932 and commissioned on September 30, 1933. <ref> {{cite web| url= http://homepage2.nifty.com/nishidah/e/stc0425.htm| title= Hatsuharu class 1st class destroyers| last= Nishidah | first=  Hiroshi| year= 2002 | work= Materials of the Imperial Japanese Navy | publisher= }}</ref> 

==Operational history==
On completion, ''Nenohi'' was assigned to the [[IJN 2nd Expeditionary Fleet]], and from 1940, she was assigned to patrol and cover landings of Japanese forces during the [[Invasion of French Indochina]]. She was docked at [[Hanoi]] during the initial stages of the operation to act as a [[radio station]] to coordinate wireless communications during the invasion, and was later based at [[Haiphong]] as a guard ship. 

===World War II history===
At the time of the [[attack on Pearl Harbor]], ''Nenohi'' was assigned as [[flag ship]] of Destroyer Division 21 of Destroyer Squadron 1 of the [[IJN 1st Fleet]] together with her [[sister ship]]s {{ship|Japanese destroyer|Hatsuharu||2}}, {{ship|Japanese destroyer|Wakaba||2}} , and {{ship|Japanese destroyer|Hatsushimo||2}} , and remained in Japanese home waters on anti-submarine patrol. From the end of January 1942, she deployed with the invasion force for the [[Netherlands East Indies]], covering landing operations at [[Kendari]] on [[Sulawesi]] on 24 January, Makassar on 8 February, and [[Bali]] and [[Lombok]] on 18 February. She returned to [[Sasebo Naval Arsenal]] at the end of March for maintenance.<ref>{{cite web| url= http://www.combinedfleet.com/Nenohi_t.htm  CombinedFleet.com| title=  IJN ''Nenohi'': Tabular Record of Movement| last= Nevitt | first=  Allyn D.  | year= 1997 |month= | work= Long Lancers | publisher= Combinedfleet.com}}</ref>

From May 1942, <U+2018><U+2018>Nenohi<U+2019><U+2019> was reassigned to northern operations, and deployed from [[<U+014C>minato Guard District]] in support of Admiral [[Boshiro Hosogaya]]<U+2019>s Northern Force in the [[Aleutians campaign]], patrolling around [[Attu Island|Attu]], [[Kiska]] and [[Amchitka Island]]. <ref>Morison. ''Aleutians, Gilberts and Marshalls, June 1942-April 1944''.</ref>
On 4 July 1942, ''Nenohi'' was [[torpedo]]ed and sunk by {{USS|Triton|SS-201}} while escorting [[seaplane carrier]] [[Japanese seaplane tender Kamikawa Maru|''Kamikawa Maru'']] southeast of Attu, near [[Agattu Island]] ({{coord|52|15|N|173|51|E}}). She capsized two minutes after being hit and sank in five minutes<U+2014> 188 were killed, including Lieutenant Commander Terauchi; 38 survivors were rescued by {{ship|Japanese destroyer|Inazuma||2}}. <ref>Brown. ''Warship Losses of World War II''</ref>

On 31 July 1942, ''Nenohi'' was removed from the [[navy list]].<ref>{{cite web | url= http://homepage2.nifty.com/nishidah/e/stc0425.htm | title=  Hatsuharu class destroyers | last= Nishidah | first=  Hiroshi | year= 2002 |month= | work= Materials of the Imperial Japanese Navy | publisher= }} </ref>
