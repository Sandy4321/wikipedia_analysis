A '''satellite navigation''' or '''SAT NAV''' system is a system of satellites that provide autonomous geo-spatial positioning with global coverage. It allows small [[electronics|electronic]] receivers to determine their location ([[longitude]], [[latitude]], and [[altitude]]) to within a few metres using [[time signal]]s transmitted along a [[Line-of-sight propagation|line-of-sight]] by radio from [[satellite]]s.  Receivers  calculate the precise time as well as position, which can be used as a reference for scientific experiments. A satellite navigation system with global coverage may be termed a '''global navigation satellite system''' or '''GNSS'''.

As of October 2011, only the [[United States]] NAVSTAR [[Global Positioning System]] (GPS) and the [[Russia]]n [[GLONASS]] are fully globally operational GNSSs. [[China]] is in the process of expanding its regional [[Beidou navigation system]] into the global [[Compass navigation system]] by 2020.<ref name=autogenerated1>{{cite web|url=http://eng.chinamil.com.cn/news-channels/china-military-news/2010-05/20/content_4222569.htm |title=Beidou satellite navigation system to cover whole world in 2020 |publisher=Eng.chinamil.com.cn |date= |accessdate=2011-12-30}}</ref> The [[European Union|European Union's]] [[Galileo positioning system]] is a GNSS in initial deployment phase, scheduled to be fully operational by 2020 at the earliest.<ref name=autogenerated2>{{cite web|url=http://www.spacenews.com/civil/110120-galileo-assessment-punches.html |title=Galileo Assessment Pulls no Punches |publisher=SpaceNews.com |date=2011-01-20 |accessdate=2011-12-30}}</ref> Several countries including France, Japan and India are in the process of developing regional navigation systems.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.livemint.com/2007/09/05002237/India-to-build-a-constellation.html |title=India to build a constellation of 7 navigation satellites by 2012 - Technology |publisher=livemint.com |date=2007-09-05 |accessdate=2011-12-30}}</ref>

Global coverage for each system is generally achieved by a [[satellite constellation]] of 20<U+2013>30 [[medium Earth orbit]] (MEO) satellites spread between several orbital planes. The actual systems vary, but use orbit inclinations of >50<U+00B0> and [[orbital period]]s of roughly twelve hours (at an altitude of about {{convert|20000|km|mi}}).

==Classification==
Satellite navigation systems that provide enhanced accuracy and integrity monitoring usable for civil navigation are classified as follows:<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ifatca.org/docs/gnss.pdf |publisher=IFATCA |title=A Beginner<U+2019>s Guide to GNSS in Europe |format=PDF}}</ref>

==History and theory==
[[Image:Accuracy of Navigation Systems.svg|300px|thumb]]
Early predecessors were the ground based [[Decca Navigator System|DECCA]], [[LORAN]] and [[Omega Navigation System|Omega]] [[radio navigation]] systems, which used terrestrial [[longwave]] radio [[transmitter]]s instead of satellites. These [[positioning system]]s broadcast a radio pulse from a known "master" location, followed by repeated pulses from a number of "slave" stations. The delay between the reception and sending of the signal at the slaves was carefully controlled, allowing the receivers to compare the delay between reception and the delay between sending. From this the distance to each of the slaves could be determined, providing a [[fix (position)|fix]].

The first satellite navigation system was [[Transit (satellite)|Transit]], a system deployed by the US military in the 1960s. Transit's operation was based on the [[Doppler effect]]: the satellites traveled on well-known paths and broadcast their signals on a well known [[frequency]]. The received frequency will differ slightly from the broadcast frequency because of the movement of the satellite with respect to the receiver. By monitoring this frequency shift over a short time interval, the receiver can determine its location to one side or the other of the satellite, and several such measurements combined with a precise knowledge of the satellite's orbit can fix a particular position.

Part of an orbiting satellite's broadcast included its precise orbital data. In order to ensure accuracy, the [[US Naval Observatory|US Naval Observatory (USNO)]] continuously observed the precise orbits of these satellites. As a satellite's orbit deviated, the USNO would send the updated information to the satellite. Subsequent broadcasts from an updated satellite would contain the most recent accurate information about its orbit.

Modern systems are more direct. The satellite broadcasts a signal that contains orbital data (from which the position of the satellite can be calculated) and the precise time the signal was transmitted. The orbital data is transmitted in a data message that is superimposed on a code that serves as a timing reference. The satellite uses an [[atomic clock]] to maintain synchronization of all the satellites in the constellation. The receiver compares the time of broadcast encoded in the transmission with the time of reception measured by an internal clock, thereby measuring the time-of-flight to the satellite. Several such measurements can be made at the same time to different satellites, allowing a continual fix to be generated in real time using an adapted version of [[trilateration]]: see [[GNSS positioning calculation]] for details.

Each distance measurement, regardless of the system being used, places the receiver on a spherical shell at the measured distance from the broadcaster. By taking several such measurements and then looking for a point where they meet, a fix is generated. However, in the case of fast-moving receivers, the position of the signal moves as signals are received from several satellites. In addition, the radio signals slow slightly as they pass through the ionosphere, and this slowing varies with the receiver's angle to the satellite, because that changes the distance through the ionosphere. The basic computation thus attempts to find the shortest directed line tangent to four oblate spherical shells centered on four satellites. Satellite navigation receivers reduce errors by using combinations of signals from multiple satellites and  multiple correlators, and then using techniques such as [[Kalman filter]]ing to combine the noisy, partial, and constantly changing data into a single estimate for position, time, and velocity.

==Civil and military uses==
{{Main|GNSS applications}}

The original motivation for satellite navigation was for military applications. Satellite navigation allows for hitherto impossible precision in the delivery of weapons to targets, greatly increasing their lethality whilst reducing inadvertent casualties from mis-directed weapons. (See [[Guided bomb]]). Satellite navigation also allows forces to be directed and to locate themselves more easily, reducing the [[fog of war]].
[[Image:Satellite-navigation.jpg|thumb|right|Satellite navigation using a [[laptop]] and a [[GPS]] receiver]]

In these ways, satellite navigation can be regarded as a [[force multiplier]]. In particular, the ability to reduce unintended casualties has particular advantages for wars where public relations is an important aspect of warfare. For these reasons, a satellite navigation system is an essential asset for any aspiring military power.  {{Citation needed|date=July 2008}}

The ability to supply satellite navigation signals is also the ability to deny their availability. The operator of a satellite navigation system potentially has the ability to degrade or eliminate satellite navigation services over any territory it desires.

==Global navigation systems==
{{Comparison satellite navigation orbits}}
===Operational===
====GPS====
{{Main|Global Positioning System}}

The United States' Global Positioning System (GPS) consists of up to 32 [[medium Earth orbit]] satellites in six different [[orbital plane (astronomy)|orbital plane]]s, with the exact number of satellites varying as older satellites are retired and replaced. Operational since 1978 and globally available since 1994, GPS is currently the world's most utilized satellite navigation system.

====GLONASS====
{{Main|GLONASS}}
The formerly [[Soviet]], and now [[Russia]]n, '' '''Glo'''bal'naya '''Na'''vigatsionnaya '''S'''putnikovaya '''S'''istema'' (Global Navigation Satellite System), or GLONASS, was a fully functional navigation constellation in 1995. After the [[collapse of the Soviet Union]], it fell into disrepair, leading to gaps in coverage and only partial availability. It was recovered and restored in 2011.

===In development===
====Compass====
{{Main|Compass navigation system}}
[[China]] has indicated they intend to expand their regional navigation system, called ''[[Beidou navigation system|Beidou]]'' or ''Big Dipper'', into a global navigation system by 2020<ref name=autogenerated1 /> a program that has been called ''Compass'' in China's official news agency [[Xinhua News Agency|Xinhua]]. The Compass system is proposed to utilize 30 [[medium Earth orbit]] satellites and five geostationary satellites. A 12-satellite regional version (covering Asia and Pacific area) is expected to be completed by 2012.

====Galileo====
{{Main|Galileo (satellite navigation)}}
The [[European Union]] and [[European Space Agency]] agreed in March 2002 to introduce their own alternative to GPS, called the [[Galileo positioning system]]. At an estimated cost of EUR 3.0 billion,<ref>{{cite news |publisher=BBC News |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/5286200.stm |title=Boost to Galileo sat-nav system |date=25 August 2006 |accessdate=2008-06-10}}</ref> the system of 30 [[Medium Earth orbit|MEO]] satellites was originally scheduled to be operational in 2010.  The estimated year to become operational is 2014.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://europa.eu/rapid/pressReleasesAction.do?reference=IP/10/7&language=en |title= Commission awards major contracts to make Galileo operational early 2014 |date=2010-01-07 |accessdate=2010-04-19}}</ref> The first experimental satellite was launched on 28 December 2005 {{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}. Galileo is expected to be compatible with the [[GPS modernization|modernized GPS]] system. The receivers will be able to combine the signals from both Galileo and GPS satellites to greatly increase the accuracy. Galileo is now not expected to be in full service until 2020 at the earliest and at a substantially higher cost.<ref name=autogenerated2 />
