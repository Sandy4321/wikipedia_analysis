'''Datong District''' ([[Chinese language|Chinese]]: <U+5927><U+540C><U+5340>; [[Wade Giles]]: Ta-t'ung) is a district of [[Taipei City]], [[Taiwan]], famous for the Dihua (Tihua) Street Market (<U+8FEA><U+5316><U+8857>) during the [[Lunar New Year]] holidays (<U+6625><U+7BC0>).  The market sells dried fruits, nuts, dried meats, dried seafood, snacks, and health drinks. Other attractions in Datong include the [[Taipei Confucius Temple]] and the [[Bao-an Temple]].
