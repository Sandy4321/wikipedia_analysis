'''''Let Me In''''' is a 2010 American [[romance film|romantic]] [[horror film]]<ref>{{cite news | date = March 9, 2010 | author = Olsen, Mark | url= http://articles.latimes.com/2010/may/09/entertainment/la-ca-letmein-20100509 |publisher= | work = Los Angeles Times |title= Matt Reeves to genre fans: 'Let Me In' |accessdate = April 4, 2011}}</ref> directed by [[Matt Reeves]] and starring [[Kodi Smit-McPhee]] and [[Chlo<U+00EB> Moretz|Chlo<U+00EB> Grace Moretz]]. It is based on the 2008 [[Cinema of Sweden|Swedish film]] ''[[Let the Right One In (film)|Let the Right One In]]'' (''L<U+00E5>t den r<U+00E4>tte komma in''), directed by [[Tomas Alfredson]], and the [[Let the Right One In|novel of the same name]] by [[John Ajvide Lindqvist]]. It tells the story of a [[School bullying|bullied]] 12-year-old boy who develops a friendship with a [[vampire]] child in a [[New Mexico]] town in the early 1980s.

Interest in producing an English version of ''Let the Right One In'' began in 2007 shortly before it was released to audiences. In 2008, [[Hammer Films]] acquired the rights for the English adaptation and initially offered Tomas Alfredson, the director of the Swedish film, the opportunity to direct, which he declined. Matt Reeves was then signed to direct and write the screenplay. Reeves made several changes for the English version such as altering the setting from [[Stockholm]] to New Mexico and renaming the lead characters. The film's producers stated that their intent was to keep the plot similar to the original, yet make it more accessible to a wider audience. Principal photography began in early November 2009, and concluded in January 2010. The film's budget was estimated to be $20 million.

''Let Me In'' premiered at the [[Toronto Film Festival]] on September 13, 2010 and was opened wide in North America on October 1, 2010. The film received highly positive reviews from critics, becoming one of the best critically reviewed films of 2010 and was placed on several critics' top-ten list. Many critics noted it as a rare Hollywood [[remake]] which stayed true to the original film from which it was based, while some criticized it for being too similar to the Swedish film in light of Reeves promoting the film as being a new take on the original novel. The film earned {{Nowrap|$24 million}} in box office revenue worldwide, of which {{Nowrap|$12 million}} was earned in the United States and Canada. Chlo<U+00EB> Moretz won several awards for her performance with critics praising the on-screen chemistry with her co-star, Kodi Smit-McPhee. ''Let Me In'' was released on [[DVD]] and [[Blu-ray]] in North America on February 1, 2011 and in the UK on March 14, 2011. An official comic book miniseries prequel titled ''Let Me In: Crossroads'' was released after the film which establishes the back-story of Abby and ends where the theatrical film begins.

==Plot==
In 1983 [[Los Alamos, New Mexico]], a police detective ([[Elias Koteas]]) enters the hospital room of a disfigured man and tries to question him about a recent murder for which he is a suspect. The detective concludes by telling the suspect that he will catch whoever else he is in league with; the detective is then called to take a phone call outside the room by the desk nurse and is told that the man's daughter is downstairs. While he is on the phone, a scream is heard, and the detective finds the suspect has fallen out of the window to his death.

[[Flashback (narrative)|Flashback]] two weeks earlier, Owen ([[Kodi Smit-McPhee]]) is an unhappy and lonely 12-year-old boy, who is neglected by his [[Divorce|divorcing]] parents, and continually harassed at school by bullies. One evening, when Owen is alone in the courtyard of his apartment complex he is approached by a girl named Abby ([[Chlo<U+00EB> Moretz|Chlo<U+00EB> Grace Moretz]]) who has moved into the apartment next door. Abby tells Owen that they cannot be friends, but regardless Abby and Owen grow closer, seeing each other at night in the courtyard, and start communicating by [[Morse code]] through the walls of their apartments. At school the main bully, Kenny ([[Dylan Minnette]]), scars Owen with an antenna rod; when Abby finds out about this she tells him to defend himself and she will help him if needed.

Meanwhile, Abby's "father", Thomas ([[Richard Jenkins]]), occasionally goes out to kill local residents in order to acquire blood for the vampiric Abby. During his first murder, he accidentally spills the blood and returns home empty handed; a furious Abby leaves the apartment and then kills and feeds on a jogger who lives in their neighborhood. Abby continues developing her relationship with Owen. One night, Thomas hides in the back of a high school student<U+2019>s car in order to later subdue him, but the student picks up a passenger, completely altering Thomas's plans. While the driver stops at a gas station, Thomas subdues the passenger, and tries to flee. He crashes the car in a nearby ditch and becomes trapped inside. Thomas douses his face with acid so that his connection to Abby will not be discovered. He is taken to the hospital; when Abby learns of this from a radio broadcast, she climbs up outside his window to see him. Thomas leans forward to offer his throat to Abby, who drinks his blood. Thomas passes out and falls to his death. The detective later gradually learns of Thomas's connection to Abby. 

The next day on a school outing to a local frozen pond in a park Kenny threatens to push Owen into an ice hole. Owen defends himself with a metal pole splitting Kenny's ear. Also while at the park, a body is discovered under the ice. Later, Owen takes Abby to an abandoned area of their apartment complex where he cuts his finger to make a blood pact with her. Abby is drawn to the blood falling to the ground; she licks it up and Owen sees her vampiric form for the first time, but instead of attacking Owen, Abby runs away and attacks Virginia ([[Sasha Barrese]]), a woman in the complex park. Owen then confronts Abby at her apartment where Abby admits that she is a vampire. Owen also discovers that Thomas was not her father, but a man she has known since he was a boy. Meanwhile at the hospital, Virginia transforms into a vampire, but when a nurse draws the curtains, the daylight causes her to burst into flames, killing them both.

Abby visits one night while Owen's mother ([[Cara Buono]]) is away. Owen opens the door for her and she tells him he needs to invite her in. He asks her why, so she enters without an invitation, which causes her to bleed heavily until he verbally acquiesces. The next morning, the detective finds Abby asleep in the bathtub, but Owen startles him, allowing Abby to grab him from behind. Abby kills the detective and starts to feed off him. Later, she is seen leaving in a taxi.

During an evening gym class, Kenny, his older brother Jimmy (Brett DelBuono), and their friends start a fire outside to distract authorities and clear out the swimming pool. Jimmy tells Owen that if he can hold his breath underwater for three minutes, then he will cut Owen's cheek; if Owen cannot, Jimmy will poke out one of Owen's eyes. As Owen is held underwater, chaos ensues as Abby slaughters the four bullies. Abby and Owen then make their escape.

Later, Owen travels on a train with Abby in a trunk beside him. They tap out "love you" to each other in Morse code as the film ends.

==Production==
===Development===
According to producer Nigel Sinclair, interest in the project initially began in the middle of 2007, before the original ''[[Let the Right One In (film)|Let the Right One In]]'' had screened for audiences.<ref>{{cite video | title = Let Me In: Nigel Sinclair Interview | url = http://www.movieweb.com/movie/let-me-in/nigel-sinclair-interview|publisher=MovieWeb.com|accessdate=March 31, 2011 }}</ref>
The rights for the English-language film were later acquired by [[Hammer Films]] at the 2008 [[Tribeca Film Festival]], where ''Let the Right One In'' won the "Founders Award for Best Narrative Feature," and [[Matt Reeves]] was quickly introduced as the director.<ref name="variety_remake">{{cite web|url= http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117992833.html |title=Matt Reeves bites into 'Right One'|last=Fleming|first=Michael|coauthors=Dave McNary|date=September 24, 2008|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|accessdate=May 19, 2009}}</ref> John Nordling and Carl Molinder, the Swedish producers of the original film, were both involved as producers for the adaptation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bloody-disgusting.com/news/17930|title='Let Me In' Officially Begins Production in New Mexico|author=MrDisgusting|date=November 2, 2009 |work=[[Bloody Disgusting]]|accessdate=April 6, 2010}}</ref> [[Tomas Alfredson]], the director of the Swedish film, was initially asked to direct the remake, but he turned it down stating that "I am too old to make the same film twice and I have other stories that I want to tell."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://totalscifionline.com/interviews/3356-tomas-alfredson-new-wave-vampires|title=Tomas Alfredson: New Wave Vampires|work=Total Sci-Fi Online|date=April 9, 2009|accessdate=March 31, 2011}}</ref> Hammer Films producer Simon Oakes initially referred to the film with "If you call it a faithful remake, I think that's true to say that's what it is.

Writer Lindqvist, on the other hand, says that Reeves told him that he "will make a new film based on the book, and not remake the Swedish film" and so "it'll be something completely different, but it's going to be really interesting to see."<ref name="JAL">{{cite web | work = [[Ain't It Cool News]] | url = http://www.aintitcool.com/node/38839 | title = The Northlander Sits Down With The Writer Of LET THE RIGHT ONE IN! | date = October 23, 2008 | accessdate = November 18, 2008 }}</ref> Reeves has expressed his intent to retain the book's early 1980s setting and his admiration for the book and Alfredson's adaptation. "It's a terrific movie and a fantastic book. I think it could be a really touching, haunting and terrifying film. I'm really excited about what it could be", he said.<ref name="mtv_remake">{{cite web| url=http://moviesblog.mtv.com/2008/11/14/exclusive-cloverfield-director-matt-reeves-reveals-let-the-right-one-in-remake-details/|title=EXCLUSIVE: 'Cloverfield' Director Matt Reeves Reveals 'Let The Right One In' Remake Details| last= Horowitz| first=Josh| date=November 14, 2008|publisher= [[Viacom]] | work = [[MTV]] Movies Blog|accessdate=May 19, 2009}}</ref> In response to the criticism he said, "I can understand because of people's love of the [original] film that there's this cynicism that I'll come in and trash it, when in fact I have nothing but respect for the film.

===Adapting and writing===
In [[Film adaptation|adapting the film]], a few adjustments were made, such as changing the names of the [[protagonist]]s to Owen and Abby,<ref name="biz_remake">{{cite web|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/bruce-willis-jessica-alba-chace-crawford-for-sale-at-cannes-2009-5|title=Bruce Willis, Jessica Alba, Chace Crawford For Sale At Cannes| last=Lewis| first= Hilary| date=13 May 2009|publisher=''The Business Insider''|accessdate=May 19, 2009}}</ref> and moving the setting from the [[Stockholm]] suburb of [[Blackeberg]] to "a small [[New Mexico]] town."<ref name="dread" /> Reeves was also asked to change the ages of the main characters, but he refused, saying that "would ruin the essence of the story and change everything completely...we need that childlike innocence." He also told his actors to not watch the original film beforehand so "we could make our own version but stay very true to the essence of the story."<ref name="Harley"/> The filmmakers have noted that "they intend to forge a unique identity for ''Let Me In'', placing it firmly in an American context", while at the same time paying respect to the original.<ref name="dread"/> In comparing his adaptation to the Swedish one, Reeves admitted to not adding many different details from the book that weren't in the original film, stating that " the story was so big that you couldn't really add a lot of stuff in without taking away the focus of the coming of age story so I tried to have allusions and references to stuff in the book." Reeves also admitted to borrowing elements from the Swedish film, stating "There are things that [Lindqvist] adapted brilliantly in the movie and I borrowed from that because I thought he did a great adaptation. But there are some things that hopefully don't detract and fit into the context of the story. It's a mixture of details from the book, the original film and things that grew out of adapting it." <ref name="Harley"/> In adapting the story for American audiences, Reeves stated that keeping the 1980s time period within the film was critical in exploring the theme of [[good and evil]]. He used [[Ronald Reagan]]'s "[[evil empire|evil empire speech]]" as an example of American thought during that time period. Reeves stated, "The idea of Reagan's 'evil empire' speech and that whole sort of school of thought was that evil was something that was outside of us. Evil was 'Other,' it was over there, it was the [[Soviets]]". Reeves felt that this idea was central to the main character Owen, as he "would be grappling with these very, very dark feelings but being in a kind of American town where there was that sort of [Reagan era] mindset and religiousness. How would you fit in? How would you feel about yourself being confused and being 12 or 13 years old and not knowing what it means that you wish you could kill those kids who were terrorizing you every day? The humanity of that."<ref>{{cite web|last=Rosenberg|first=Adam|url=http://moviesblog.mtv.com/2010/07/26/let-me-in-director-matt-reeves-hopes-to-set-his-work-apart-from-let-the-right-one-in/|title=How 'Let Me In' Director Matt Reeves Hopes To Set His Work Apart From 'Let The Right One In'|publisher=[[MTV]]|date=July 26, 2010|accessdate=April 5, 2011}}</ref>

Faden noted the techniques used in another challenging shot important to Abby's character in which she begins bleeding when she enters Owen's apartment without invitation. Faden stated, "Normally in such a scene, the character would be shot on set, dressed in blood.

===Music and soundtrack===
{{Main|Let Me In: Original Motion Picture Soundtrack}}

'''''Let Me In: Original Motion Picture Soundtrack''''' is the film's [[soundtrack album]]. It was released by [[Var<U+00E8>se Sarabande]] on October 12, 2010. The soundtrack was composed by [[Michael Giacchino]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.dreadcentral.com/news/38397/let-me-in-score-be-composed-michael-giacchino| title=Let Me In Score to Be Composed by Michael Giacchino|work=DreadCentral.com|date=July 7, 2010|accessdate=April 1, 2011}}</ref> Giacchino stated that scoring the film was a difficult "balancing act" for some scenes. He mentioned, "I was always trying to say, 'let's take music out!' and Matt [Reeves] was like, 'no, put it in!'" In composing the score, he stated that he also applied certain musical themes to each character for which the audience could respond to as the story progressed. Composing the score to convey the correct emotion was also a challenge for Giacchino who said, "...it was tricky finding the right balance of, well, should this be scary? Or should this be sentimental? Or should it be emotional? Or should it be this? It was a weird balance because you're dealing with a dynamic that is quite questionable as far as what everyone's intentions are in the film.<ref name="Giacchino">{{cite web|author=Gilchrist,Todd|url=http://blog.moviefone.com/2010/09/30/interview-composer-michael-giacchino-let-me-in/| title=Composer Michael Giacchino on 'Let Me In,' Monsters and the Movies in Your Head|work=Moviefone|date=September 30, 2010|accessdate=April 3, 2011}}</ref>

''Let Me In'' was not well-received by all critics. Some disputed Reeves' claims that he was not remaking the film but re-adapting the book, criticizing it for being too similar to the Swedish film. Josh Tyler wrote "The movie he<U+2019>s made is absolutely a direct remake of the 2008 film, the two are so similar that it<U+2019>s almost impossible to differentiate between them."<ref>{{cite web| first= Josh |last=Tyler |url=http://www.cinemablend.com/reviews/Let-Me-In-4871.html |title=Let Me In Movie Review|work=CinemaBlend|date=September 30, 2010|accessdate=April 1, 2011}}</ref> In a similar vein, Jamie S. Rich noted that while there was plenty of content in the original novel that the Swedish film omitted, "Reeves hasn't really ferreted out anything new; on the contrary, there is actually less plot in ''Let Me In'' than in the Alfredson version."<ref>{{cite web

===Author's response===
[[John Ajvide Lindqvist]], author of ''Let the Right One In'', who also wrote the screenplay for the original Swedish film, was pleased with ''Let Me In''. He said:
{{Quote|I might just be the luckiest writer alive. To have not only one, but two excellent versions of my debut novel done for the screen feels unreal. ''Let the Right One In'' is a great Swedish movie. ''Let Me In'' is a great American movie. There are notable similarities and the spirit of Tomas Alfredson is present. But ''Let Me In'' puts the emotional pressure in different places and stands firmly on its own legs. Like the Swedish movie it made me cry, but not at the same points. ''Let Me In'' is a dark and violent love story, a beautiful piece of cinema and a respectful rendering of my novel for which I am grateful.
