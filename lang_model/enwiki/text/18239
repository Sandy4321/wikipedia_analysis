His first medals came in 1998, when he took bronze and team gold at the junior race at the [[IAAF World Cross Country Championships]] and won a silver in the 5000&nbsp;m at the [[1998 African Championships in Athletics]]. With [[Haile Gebrselassie]] as his training partner, he continued to improve, winning the junior race and taking bronze in the senior short course for a medalling double at the [[1999 IAAF World Cross Country Championships|1999 World Cross Country Championships]]. He also won the [[1500 metres]] gold medal at the [[All-Africa Games]] that year.

He attended the 1999 and 2001 [[World Championships in Athletics]] and represented Ethiopia at the [[2000 Summer Olympics]], but he failed to make the podium at any of the events.
