The '''Roland D.VI''' was a [[German Empire|German]] fighter aircraft built at the end of [[World War I]]. It lost a fly-off to the [[Fokker D.VII]], but production went ahead anyway as insurance against problems with the Fokker.

==Design and development==
The Roland D.VI was designed by the [[Luft-Fahrzeug-Gesellschaft]] (L.F.G.), (whose aircraft were made under the trade name "Roland" after 1914 to avoid confusion with the [[LVG|Luftverkehrsgesellschaft m.b.H]] (L.V.G.)) late in 1917, with the prototype being the 1000th aircraft to be built by L.F.G., first flying in November 1917.<ref name="complete fighters p338"/> The D.VI was a single bay biplane which discarded the so called ''Wickelrumpf'', or semi-[[monocoque]] fuselage. made from two layers of thin strips of plywood, diagonally ''wrapped around'' a male form to create a "half-shell", that used in previous L.F.G aircraft such as the [[Roland C.II]], [[Roland D.I|D.I]] and [[LFG Roland D.II|D.II]] in favour of the equally unusual (for aircraft use) ''Klinkerrumpf'' (or [[Clinker (boat building)|clinker]]-built) construction where the fuselage was built of overlapping strips of spruce over a light wooden framework.<ref name="Thetford p166-167">Gray and Thetford 1961, pp. 166<U+2013>167.</ref> Visibility for the pilot was good, while the aircraft had above average manoeuvrability.<ref name="Thetford p167">Gray and Thetford 1961, p. 167.</ref>

==Operational history==
[[File:Albatros IV.jpg|thumb|Mercedes-powered Roland D.VIa.]] <!-- filename is wrong -->
In January 1918, two D.VIs were entered into the first fighter competition held by ''[[Idflieg]]'' at [[Adlershof]], one powered by a 160&nbsp;hp (119&nbsp;kW) [[Mercedes D.III]] engine and the other by a [[Benz D.III]] of similar power.  Although the winner of the competition was the [[Fokker D.VII]], orders were placed for the Roland as insurance against production problems with the Fokker.<ref name="Thetford p166">Gray and Thetford 1961, p. 166.</ref> 

A total of 350 were built, 150 D.VIas powered by the Mercedes, while the remaining 200 were powered by the Benz III and were called D.VIb.  Deliveries started in May 1918, with 70 D.VIs in frontline service on 31 August 1918.<ref name="complete fighters p338"/>

The only surviving artifact of the LFG Roland D.VI still existing in the 21st century is the complete fuselage of a D.VIb, displaying [[IdFlieg]] military serial number 2225/18, on display at the [[Polish Aviation Museum]] in Krakow, Poland.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.muzeumlotnictwa.pl/zbiory_sz.php?ido=9&w=a |title=Aeroplane: LFG Roland D.VI |author=Polish Aviation Museum |date= |work= |publisher=Polish Aviation Museum |accessdate=July 28, 2012}}</ref>
