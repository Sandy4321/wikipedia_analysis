The '''First Presbyterian Church of Marcellus''' is located at the intersection of North Street ([[New York State Route 174]]) and East Main Street (also NY 174) in the [[Marcellus (village), New York|village of Marcellus, New York]], and is the oldest of four churches in the village. In October 1801, Reverend Caleb Alexander organized the 18-member Church of Christ in Marcellus with a wooden meeting house constructed two years later.  He was succeeded in 1807 by Revd Levi Parsons who served until 1841.

By 1819, three churches had been built in the environs of Marcellus: The First Church in Marcellus, The Second Church in [[Skaneateles, New York]], and The Third Church on State Road (now [[U.S. Route 20 in New York|U.S. Route 20]]) which fared poorly after member deaths and migrations. Beginning in 1948, The First Church was remodelled and re-dedicated in April 1952. In 1957, the church elected its first woman elder.  Critics have found the structure one of the finest examples of Greek Revival church architecture in [[Onondaga County, New York|Onondaga County]].

== Original church (1803&ndash;1851) ==
The village of Marcellus was founded in 1794 with Presbyterians, Congregationalists, Baptists and villagers of other denominations meeting for worship in Deacon Samuel Rice's tavern. On October 13, 1801, the village's first worship society, the 18-member Church of Christ, was organized under Reverend Caleb Alexander, a missionary active in central [[New York]]. In May 1802, the society was incorporated as the Eastern Religious Society of Marcellus.  On August 12, 1802, the society voted to build a church, and a trustee donated an acre of land at the intersection of Main Street and North Street in the present-day village of Marcellus. In 1803, construction of the wooden meeting house was completed but lacked a  steeple, a bell, stoves and ceilings. Congregants warmed themselves with foot stoves, squirrel fur, and the "power of the spirit".<ref name="book">{{cite book |last=Heffernan |first=Kathryn C. |title=Nine Mile Country |publisher=Visual Artis Publicans, Inc |date=1978 |pages=175&ndash;180 |url=http://www.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~nyononda/CHURCH/MARPRESB.HTM |accessdate=June 19, 2009}}</ref> 

Itinerant missionaries served the meeting house for its first few years, but in 1807, the congregation adopted fifteen articles of faith and a covenant which remained as prerequisites for membership for one hundred years. The same year the church became affiliated with the Presbyterian Synod of Albany, and then, in 1810, became a charter member of the Presbytery of Cayuga, which, in 1811, became part of the newly formed Synod of Geneva.  In 1814, a steeple was built, the interior of the church painted, and The Female Charitable Society of Marcellus donated $133.34 to the Genessee Missionary Society.  In 1807, Revd Levi Parsons was installed and served until 1833 when he accepted posts in [[Tully, New York|Tully, New York]] and [[Otisco, New York|Otisco, New York]]. He returned to Marcellus in 1835 and remained until 1841 when Revd John Tompkins was appointed. The society became the Marcellus First Religious Society during Parsons' absence.<ref name="book" />

By 1819, the church had experienced considerable growth. The Second Church was erected in what is now Skaneateles, New York, and The Third Church was built in Marcellus on State Road (now U.S. Route 20), which, after twenty prosperous years, experienced declining membership following deaths and migrations.  During this time, The First Church was given a new steeple, and painted and extended at a cost of $4,500 (${{Formatprice|{{Inflation|USD|4500|1814|r=-2}}}} today).<ref name="book" />

==Present church (1851&ndash;present) ==
[[File:First Pres Church 1860.JPG|left|thumb|A map from 1860 detailing the location of the church. Next door to the church was the home of Reverend John Tompkins]]

By 1850, The First Church was in need of repair and sold for $500 (${{Formatprice|{{Inflation|USD|500|1952|r=-2}}}} today) which, in the agreement, was applied to the construction of a new church on the same site at a cost of $3,800. The new church was dedicated on October 13, 1851, the fiftieth anniversary of the congregation.<ref name="book" />  

Two years after the 1851 construction and dedication of the new church, a bell was fitted to the steeple.  In 1866, Reverend Tompkins, died on the eve of his 25th anniversary with the church. With his death, the church appointed two interim ministers, the Revds W.S. Franklin and Dwight Scovel.      A change in boundaries, by act of the General Assembly in 1869, brought the Marcellus Church within the Syracuse Presbytery which was merged with the Cayuga Presbytery. In 1877, the Women's Missionary Society was formed.   In 1880, Reverend George Smith was appointed, but, in 1882, accepted a position at [[Canandaigua Academy]].  Before Smith left, he celebrated its 80th anniversary on October 13, 1881 with the composition of its history. With Smith's departure, Revd Alex McA. Thornburn was appointed and served the community for five years, not only in the church but as  [[chaplain]] of the Marcellus G.A.R. post.<ref name="book" /> 

On November 16. 1887, Revd Thornburn was succeeded by Revd A. H. Cameron, who served ten years with the church. In 1893 and 1894, the church was remodelled once again, with new kitchens, a church parlor, new stained glass windows, and a new heating system which replaced the original stoves. The church began conducting [[Sunday school]] classes for those unable to attend services in [[Marcellus Falls, New York|Marcellus Falls]] (north of town), and [[Shepard Settlement, New York|Shepard Settlement]], a nearby hamlet.<ref name="book" /> 

In 1897, Revd Cameron was succeeded by Revd A.K. McNaughton, who served ten years and celebrated the church's 100th anniversary on October 13, 1901.  McNaughton left in 1907,  and was replaced by Reverend F.J. Sauber who served until 1914 and who was followed by Revd C.C. Frost.  In 1921,  Revd David S. MacGinn was appointed and served until 1928. During Reverend MacGinn's reign, the church's horse and carriage sheds, which were constructed in 1849, were demolished, and new ones constructed.  In 1961, the sheds were torn down to make way an extension of the church. The sheds had been rented for several years to local car owners as garages.  In 1924, the spire was destroyed during a severe windstorm but was replaced shortly thereafter at a cost of $3,500 (${{Formatprice|{{Inflation|USD|3500|1952|r=-3}}}} today)<ref name="book" />

Revd Robert Lloyd Roberts served the Marcellus church during the depression and war years from 1931 to 1944. Dr. Albert Dutton Stearns, who was called in 1944, continued as pastor until 1948.  From 1948 to 1956, Revd Ralph Miller served the congregation, and during this period, the body of the building was raised, the sanctuary redone and refurbished, and a basement constructed with the additions of a kitchen, a dining room, a lounge and several classrooms at a cost of $65,000 (${{Formatprice|{{Inflation|USD|65000|1952|r=-3}}}} today). The church was rededicated after completion of construction in April 1952. On December 9, 1956, Revd Miller was succeeded by Revd Keith Shinaman, a graduate of [[Syracuse University]], and, in 1957, Miss Helen Austin was ordained as the first woman elder. The present session of eighteen elders includes nine women.<ref name="book" /> 

Revd Shinaman has remained with the church for over fifty years, but was succeeded by Revd Bill Grossman, who presently serves the congregation with Reverend Shinaman, the minister emeritus.<ref name="staff">{{cite web|url=http://marcelluspresbyterian.com/Staff.html|title=Marcellus First Presbyterian Church Staff|date=2009|publisher=Marcellus First Presbyterian Church|pages=1|accessdate=June 19, 2009}}</ref> In 2001, the church celebrated its 200th anniversary.<ref name="history2">{{cite web|url=http://marcelluspresbyterian.com/History.html|title=A Brief History of the First Presbyterian Church of Marcellus|date=2009|publisher=First Presbyterian Church of Marcellus|pages=1|accessdate=June 19, 2009}}</ref>

Of the church structure itself, it was noted in ''Architecture Worth Saving in Onondaga County'' (1964) that "This is certainly one of the most architecturally distinguished churches in [[Onondaga County]], and a particularly fine example of Greek revival architecture [...] The interior was unfortunately 'improved' with 'new arrangement of pews, and organ, new windows, carpets and chandeliers in 1896 [...] In recent years the steeple was blown down, falling into the nave. Although rebuilt to approximately the original proportions, the transitional detail between the square belfry and the conical spire was unfortunately eliminated. Also regrettable [...] is the recent replacement of the original wood-paneled entrance doors [...] The future of our finest Greek Revival church is uncertain [...] Destruction would be a loss to the entire community."<ref name="book" />
