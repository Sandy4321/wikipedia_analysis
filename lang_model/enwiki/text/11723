'''H<U+00E9>ctor Lavoe''' born '''H<U+00E9>ctor Juan P<U+00E9>rez Mart<U+00ED>nez''' ([[September 30]], [[1946]] - [[June 29]], [[1993]]) <ref name="Triump">{{cite web| author=Eileen Torres| url=http://www.salsacentro.com/hectorlavoe.htm| title=The Triumph and Tragedy of Hector Lavoe | accessdate=2007-06-13}}</ref>  was a [[Puerto Rico|Puerto Rican]] [[salsa music|salsa]] [[singer]]. Lavoe is the son of Luis Perez and Panchita Mart<U+00ED>nez and the father of two sons.<ref name="salsa centro"/> His first son, Jos<U+00E9> Alberto P<U+00E9>rez was the result of a relationship with Carmen Castro. Hector married Nilda Rosado  after she notified him that she was pregnant with his second son, H<U+00E9>ctor Jr. 

Lavoe was born and raised in the Machuelito sector of Ponce, Puerto Rico. Early in his life, he attended a local music school and developed an interest inspired by Jes<U+00FA>s S<U+00E1>nchez Erazo.<ref name="salsa centro"/> He moved to New York city when he was seventeen years old.<ref name="salsa centro"/> On his first week living in the city, he accepted to work as the vocalist of a sextet formed by Roberto Garc<U+00ED>a.<ref name="salsa centro"/> During this period he would perform with several other groups including Orquesta New York, Kako All-Stars and the Johnny Pacheco band. 

In 1967, Lavoe joined Willie Col<U+00F3>n's band and performed as the band vocalist.<ref name="CMT"/> With the Willie Col<U+00F3>n band Lavoe recorded several hit songs including ''El malo'' and ''Canto a Borinquen''. While working with the Willie Col<U+00F3>n band, Lavoe became addicted to drugs. When Col<U+00F3>n retired, Lavoe became a soloist and formed his own band, where he performed as lead vocalist.<ref name="CMT"/> As a soloist Lavoe recorded several hits including ''El cantante'', ''Bandolera'' and ''El peri<U+00F3>dico de ayer''. During this period he was frequently featured as an invited vocalist in the [[Fania All Stars]], and recorded numerous tracks with the band.<ref name="salsa centro"/>

In 1979, Lavoe experienced a strong depression and sought the help of a high priest to attend his drug addiction. After a short rehabilitation, the deaths of his father, son and mother in law made him return to the addiction.<ref name="Triump"/>  These events and being diagnosed with HIV, affected Lavoe to the point of attemping suicide by jumping off the balcony of his hotel room.<ref name="Triump"/>  Lavoe survived and recorded a disc before his health began failing. Lavoe died in [[June 29]] [[1993]], from a complication of [[AIDS]].<ref name="salsa centro"/>

==Early life==

H<U+00E9>ctor was born in [[Ponce, Puerto Rico]] to Pachita and Luis P<U+00E9>rez, and raised in the Machuelito [[barrio]] of the city.<ref name="Bio">{{cite web| url=http://www.solosabor.com/hectorlavoe.html| title=Solo Sabor Latin Entertainment: H<U+00E9>ctor Lavoe| accessdate=2007-06-13}}</ref> He was inspired early in life by his musically-talented family. His grandfather Don Juan Mart<U+00ED>nez was a singer of controversial songs, which often went from vocal conflict to physical confrontations. His uncle was a well-known [[tres]] player in Ponce.<ref name="Bio"/> His mother Pachita was well known among her family and townspeople for her beautiful singing voice.<ref name="Bio"/> His father Luis supported his wife and eight children by singing and playing guitar with trios and big bands. H<U+00E9>ctor would also be influenced by Puerto Rican singers such as Jesus Sanchez Erazo also known as ''"Chu<U+00ED>to el de Bayam<U+00F3>n"''- one of the island's most successful folk singers, and [[Daniel Santos (singer)|Daniel Santos]].<ref name="Bio"/> Later in his life, he would have the honor of recording songs with both artists.

H<U+00E9>ctor attended the local [[Juan Morel Campos]] Public School of Music where the [[saxophone]] was the first instrument he learned to play. Among his classmates were Jose Febles and multi-instrumentalist [[Papo Lucca]].<ref name="Bac<U+00E1>n"/> One of his teachers would strictly demand good diction, stage presence and manners from him claiming that as a [[bolero]] singer, H<U+00E9>ctor would become a superstar. By the age of 17, Lavoe abandoned school and sang with a ten-piece band.<ref name="CMT">{{cite web|url=http://www.cmt.com/artists/az/lavoe_hector/bio.jhtml| title=CMT: H<U+00E9>ctor Lavoe| accessdate=2007-06-16}}</ref> He moved permanently to New York on [[May 3]], [[1963]], against his father's wishes, since an older brother had moved to the city and later died of a drug overdose.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://worldmusic.nationalgeographic.com/worldmusic/view/page.basic/artist/content.artist/hector_lavoe| title=H<U+00E9>ctor Lavoe: National Geographic Music| accessdate=2007-06-16}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| url=http://salsa2u.freeservers.com/prod01.htm| title=H<U+00E9>ctor Lavoe - Salsa2u| accessdate=2007-06-17}}</ref> It would take many more years before H<U+00E9>ctor was able to reconcile with his father.

[[Image:Lavoe 7.jpg|right|220px|thumb|H<U+00E9>ctor Lavoe and Willie Col<U+00F3>n]]

==Arrival in New York City==

He was met by his sister Priscilla upon arrival in New York.<ref name="His Life">{{cite web| url=http://www.hectorlavoe.com/home.html| title=H<U+00E9>ctor Lavoe: His Life| accessdate=2007-06-16}}</ref> The first thing he did in New York was visit [[El Barrio]], New York's "Spanish Harlem."<ref name="His Life"/> H<U+00E9>ctor was disappointed in the condition of El Barrio which contrasted with his vision of "fancy Cadillacs, tall marble skyscrapers and tree-lined streets."<ref name="His Life"/> Hector stayed at his sister's apartment in [[The Bronx]], instead.

The first week in New York, H<U+00E9>ctor was invited by his friend [[Roberto Garc<U+00ED>a]], a fellow musician and childhood friend, to a rehearsal of a newly formed [[sextet]].<ref name="His Life"/>  When he arrived they were rehearsing the romantic bolero ''Tus Ojos''. The lead vocalist was singing off key, and as a gesture of goodwill, Lavoe showed the vocalist how it was supposed to sound.<ref name="His Life"/>Following this event, the group offered him the spot of lead vocalist, which he subsequently accepted.<ref name="His Life"/> 

Later in his career, he joined other groups in the genre, including  Orquesta New York, Kako All-Stars, and [[Johnny Pacheco]]. To distinguish H<U+00E9>ctor from other Latino singers, a former manager made him adopt [[Felipe Rodriguez]]'s moniker "La Voz" ("The Voice") and turned it into a stage name, Lavoe.<ref name="His Life"/> 

In [[1967]], he met Salsa recorder [[Willie Col<U+00F3>n]]. Pacheco, co-owner of [[Fania Records]] and its recording musical director, suggested that Col<U+00F3>n  record Lavoe on a track of Col<U+00F3>n's first album ''El Malo''.  Given the good results, Col<U+00F3>n had Lavoe record the rest of the album's vocal tracks.  Willie never officially asked Lavoe to join his band, but after the recording, Willie said to him, ''"On Saturday we start at 10 p.m. at El Tropicoro Club."''<ref name="tbxmix">{{cite web| url=http://www.tbxmix.com/frames/hectorlavoe.htm| title=TBXMIX: H<U+00E9>ctor Lavoe| accessdate=2007-06-16}}</ref>

The album's success significantly transformed both Col<U+00F3>n's and Lavoe's lives.<ref name="His Life"/> Col<U+00F3>n's band featured a raw, aggressive all-trombone sound that was well received by salsa fans, and Lavoe complemented the style with his articulate voice, talent for improvisation, and sense of humor.<ref name="His Life"/> H<U+00E9>ctor received instant recognition, steady work, and enough money to provide him with a comfortable lifestyle.<ref name="His Life"/>  According to Lavoe, it happened so fast he didn't know how to cope with the sudden success.

During that year Lavoe started a romantic relationship with Carmen Castro, during this relationship Castro became pregnant but refused to marry him because she considered him a "[[womanizer]]."<ref name="American Salsa"/> Lavoe's first son, Jos<U+00E9> Alberto P<U+00E9>rez was born on [[October 30]], [[1968]].<ref name="American Salsa"/> On the night when Jos<U+00E9> was baptized, H<U+00E9>ctor received a call informing him that Nilda Rosado (with whom he also had a relationship during the same period he was with Castro) was pregnant.<ref name="American Salsa"/> H<U+00E9>ctor's second son, H<U+00E9>ctor Jr. was born on [[September 25]], [[1969]].<ref name="American Salsa"/> Following this event, the couple married, and following a request by Rosado, Lavoe kept the amount of contact with Castro and Jos<U+00E9> Alberto to a minimum during their marriage.<ref name="American Salsa"/>

== Music ==
=== The Willie Col<U+00F3>n years ===

In late 1970, Col<U+00F3>n and Lavoe recorded the first of two ''"Asalto Navide<U+00F1>o"'' albums, featuring Puerto Rican folk songs such as Ramito's [[jibaro]] song ''"Patria y Amor"'' (renamed ''"Canto a Borinquen"'') and original compositions.<ref name="Navidad">{{cite web|url=http://www.htzfm.com/album/169456| title=Overview: Willie Col<U+00F3>n/Hector Lavoe - Asalto Navide<U+00F1>o | accessdate=2007-06-16}}</ref> The album, which also featured Puerto Rican [[cuatro]] player [[Yomo Toro]], is regarded as an all-time salsa classic, still selling strong more than 35 years after its recording. It also gave the Col<U+00F3>n band its signature song, ''"La Murga"'', an ode to Panama's musical festivals that transposed a rather simple [[bass guitar]] line to trombone, producing a by-now classic salsa riff as a result.<ref name="Navidad"/> 

While enjoying his newly-found success, H<U+00E9>ctor became severely addicted to narcotics, namely heroin, and prescription drugs.<ref name="Babalao">{{cite web| author=Pepe M<U+00E1>rquez| url=http://www.comoenla.com/nostalgias/Texto/01%20Lavoe.htm| title=H<U+00E9>ctor Lavoe: El cantante de los cantantes| accessdate=2007-06-13}}</ref> His addiction resulted in him showing up late for gigs, and he eventually did not show up to some scheduled performances at all. Although Col<U+00F3>n would eventually cut ties with him, he tried to help Lavoe seek assistance to try to quit his drug habits.

Lavoe's lack of professionalism was often neutralized by an affable onstage presence, very much resembling that of a [[stand-up comedian]].<ref name="Motherflower"/> Another famous incident has a middle-aged audience member at a dance request a Puerto Rican [[danza]] from Col<U+00F3>n's band, to which Lavoe responded with an insult.<ref name="Motherflower"/> The requester then gave Lavoe such a beating that he almost ended up in the hospital. The request was finally honored in a later Col<U+00F3>n record, ''"El Juicio"'' (The Trial), when he added a danza section to the Rafael Mu<U+00F1>oz song ''"So<U+00F1>ando despierto"'', which Lavoe introduces with a deadpanned: ''"<U+00A1>Para t<U+00ED>, Motherflower!"'' (a [[euphemism]] for "This one's for you, [[motherfucker]]!")<ref name="Motherflower"> {{cite web| author= Muriel, Tommy| url=http://www.herencialatina.com/Rivalidades/rivalidades_en_la_musica_latina.htm| title=Rivalidades en la m<U+00FA>sica latina (o la tiradera en la salsa)| accessdate=2007-06-13}}</ref>  

[[Image:Hector lavoe thebadboys.jpg|right|220px|thumb|Jos<U+00E9> Mangual, H<U+00E9>ctor Lavoe and Willie Col<U+00F3>n performing]] 

The Col<U+00F3>n band had other major hits, such as ''"Calle Luna, Calle Sol"'', and the [[santeria]] influenced "Aguanil<U+00E9>"; a Pacheco song recorded in the studio by the band, "Mi Gente", was better known in a live version Lavoe later recorded with the [[Fania All Stars]].

===Lavoe goes solo===
In 1973, Willie Col<U+00F3>n stopped touring to dedicate himself to record production and other business enterprises. Lavoe was given the opportunity of becoming bandleader to his own orchestra;<ref name="salsa centro"/> he and his band traveled the world on their own, and he would also be a guest singer for the [[Fania All-Stars]]. As part of these invitations, Lavoe was present at several shows with the group. One of the group<U+2019>s notable presentations took place in the [[Kinshasa]] providence of the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]]. Where the group performed as part of the activies promoting [[The Rumble in the Jungle]], a boxing fight between [[Muhammad Ali]] and [[George Foreman]] for the heavyweight championships of the World Boxing Council and World Boxing Association. 

The Fania All Star recorded several of their tracks in live concerts.  Lavoe was part of the group when the All-Stars returned to the Yankee Stadium in 1975, where the band recorded a two volume production entitled ''Live At Yankee Stadium''. The event featured the top vocalists in Fania and Vaya records, Lavoe was included in the group along Ismael Miranda, Cheo Feliciano, Justo Betancourt, Ismael Quintana, Bobby Cruz, Pete <U+201C>El Conde<U+201D> Rodriguez, Santos Col<U+00F3>n and Celia Cruz. Lavoe recorded songs in fifteen different productions with the band, serving as vocalist in twenty-three songs. Besides recording songs with the band, Lavoe  was also present in three movies filmed and produced by Fania Records, these were: ''Fania All Stars: Our Latin Thing'', ''Fania All Stars: Salsa'' and ''Celia Cruz with the Fania All Stars Live in Africa''.<ref name="salsa centro"/> His Col<U+00F3>n-produced albums would be best sellers; cuts from these albums were hits in Puerto Rico and the rest of Latin America:

*Lavoe's recording of [[Tite Curet Alonso]]'s ''"El Peri<U+00F3>dico de Ayer"'' was a number one hit in Mexican charts for four straight months. It was also a strong hit in several countries of the Caribbean and South America.<ref name="Bac<U+00E1>n"/>

*As a producer, Willie Col<U+00F3>n had Lavoe recorded what would become his [[signature song]], the [[Ruben Blades]]-authored song ''"El Cantante"'', against Blades' protests (Blades wanted to record the song on his own). Blades has repeatedly acknowledged since that Lavoe raised his song to classic status, and that Lavoe's performance was much better than what he would accomplish with it.

*The Lavoe song ''"Bandolera"'' was a strong seller in Puerto Rico, despite strong protests from Puerto Rican feminists about its lyrics and soneos (Lavoe twice offers the song's subject a beating).<ref name="Bac<U+00E1>n"/>

*Lavoe's recording of the [[Nicol<U+00E1>s Guill<U+00E9>n]] poem ''"S<U+00F3>ngoro Cosongo"'', set to salsa music, was another major hit.<ref name="American Salsa">{{cite web| url=http://www.americasalsa.com/biografias/hector_lavoe_02.html| title=American Salsa: H<U+00E9>ctor Lavoe| accessdate=2007-06-16}}</ref>

*The controversial [[j<U+00ED>baro]] song, ''"Joven contra viejo"'', featured Lavoe and [[Daniel Santos (singer)|Daniel Santos]], settling their age-based differences on-stage, not without a heavy dose of humor and (yet again) Yomo Toro's cuatro music as a backdrop. It was a major Christmas hit in Puerto Rico in [[1979]].<ref name="Bac<U+00E1>n">{{cite web| url=http://www.laconga.org/hl_gdominguez.htm| title=Hector Lavoe: Cronolog<U+00ED>a de un Bac<U+00E1>n de Barrio| accessdate=2007-06-17}}</ref>

*Lavoe's final hit, ''"El Rey de la Puntualidad"'' (The King of Punctuality), is a humorous takeoff on Lavoe's constant tardiness and occasional absenteeism from shows.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.myjavaserver.com/servlet/losandres.Letra?arch=917| title=Hector Lavoe >> El Rey de la puntualidad| publisher=J-Lyrics| accessdate=2007-07-09}}</ref>

==Last years and posthumous homages==
In 1978, Lavoe was being consumed by a strong depression and was contemplating suicide.<ref name="Babalao"/> Looking for a way to rehabilitate himself, H<U+00E9>ctor consulted a Babalao (high priest in the [[Santeria]] religion) who recommended complete isolation.<ref name="Babalao"/> Lavoe followed the Santeria priest's advice and cut all communication with his family and friends for a period of two months.<ref name="Babalao"/> Following this event H<U+00E9>ctor, reappeared confident and apparently free of his drug addiction.<ref name="Babalao"/>

Following his rehabilitation, Lavoe's life was plagued by tragic events, emotional turmoil, and pain.<ref name="Babalao"/>  His mother-in-law and father died, and his seventeen year old son Hector, Jr. was accidentally shot by a friend. Also, Lavoe was diagnosed with [[HIV]], the virus that progresses to [[AIDS]], and these events were enough to push him to his limit.<ref name="Babalao"/>

On the night of Saturday, [[June 25th]], [[1988]], H<U+00E9>ctor was scheduled to perform at the Rub<U+00E9>n Rodr<U+00ED>guez Coliseum in [[Bayamon]], [[Puerto Rico]]. Sales for the concert were low, and Ralph Mercado who was the promoter of the event decided to cancel the concert.<ref name="Triump"/>  H<U+00E9>ctor, defiant to the end, and knowing that it would be one of the last times he would perform in Puerto Rico, decided to, against the promoter's wishes, perform in front of the public who did pay to see the now cancelled concert.<ref name="Triump"/> 

The next day, on [[June 26]], [[1988]], H<U+00E9>ctor attempted to commit suicide by jumping off the ninth floor of the Regency Hotel Condado in Puerto Rico.<ref name="tbxmix"/>  No exact reason for this was ever determined.  He survived the attempt, but from that day forward, he would never completely recover, as AIDS began to ravage his body, due to the use of intravenous drugs and needle exchange.<ref name="Triump"/>

In 1990, Hector performed for the last time (and with the Fania All Stars) in New Jersey.<ref name="His Life"/>  It was to be a comeback concert, but Hector could not even sing several notes to his famous song "Mi Gente".<ref name="His Life"/>  This was H<U+00E9>ctor's last public presentation.

H<U+00E9>ctor died penniless on [[June 29]], [[1993]] in New York City. The cause of death was diagnosed as a complication caused by  AIDS.<ref name="salsa centro">[http://www.salsacentro.com/hectorlavoe.htm The Triumph and Tragedy of Hector Lavoe] from ''salsacentro.com''</ref>  He was initially buried in a plot in [[Saint Raymond's Cemetery]] in the [[Bronx]]. In June 2002 the bodies of both Lavoe and his son (who died in 1987 at the age of 18) were exhumed per his family's request. They were later reburied in his native Ponce, along with his wife Nilda who passed away a few weeks prior to the reburial.

===Posthumous recognitions===
Lavoe's life has served as inspiration for two [[Biographical film|Biographical films]]. The first, [[El Cantante]], is produced by two of the most prominent celebrities in the musical genre: salsa superstar [[Marc Anthony]], stars as Lavoe, and [[Jennifer Lopez]] as Hector's wife, Nilda (known as "Puchi" by close friends).<ref>{{cite web|publisher=Internet Movie Data Base| url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0458522/| title=El Cantante| accessdate=2007-07-09}}</ref>

Salsa singer [[La India]] is producing her own biopic of Lavoe's life, entitled The Singer, with actor Raul Carbonell in the lead role.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0811069/| title=The Singer| publisher=Internet Movie Data Base| accessdate=2007-07-09}}</ref> Besides these films, an [[off-Broadway]] production of his life titled ''<U+00BF>Qui<U+00E9>n mat<U+00F3> a H<U+00E9>ctor Lavoe?''
