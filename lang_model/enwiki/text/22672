Nutley grew slowly as [[Newark, New Jersey|Newark]] developed.  The first European settler in the area, recorded in the minutes of a Newark town meeting in 1693, was a Dutch painter named Bastian Van Giesen.<ref name=NutleyHistory>[http://www.nutleynj.org/content/history.html History of Nutley], Township of Nutley. Accessed January 21, 2014.</ref> His house, known as [[Vreeland Homestead]], still stands today on Chestnut Street and is the location of the Nutley Women's Club.  John Treat and Thomas Stagg purchased lots adjacent to Van Geisen's in 1695 and 1698 respectively. The [[Van Riper House]] is another building from the era.

The first [[brownstone]] quarry in Nutley is believed to have been in operation by the early 18th century and was the town's first major industry.<ref name=NutleyHistory/> Jobs at the brownstone quarry in the Avondale section of Nutley provided work for many Italian and Irish immigrants. Mills situated along the Third River in the area now known as Memorial Park I became Nutley's second major industry.<ref name=NutleyHistory/>

John and Thomas Speer, Joseph Kingsland, and Henry Duncan all operated mills in the town during the 1800s.  Current streets in Nutley are named after these mill owners. Henry Duncan built several mills throughout the town and established the village of Franklinville consisting of 30 homes and a few small businesses which later became the center of Nutley.<ref name=NutleyHistory/> One of Duncan's buildings has been modified and now serves as the town hall. [[Kingsland Manor]] is a national historic place.

During the late 1880s, painter [[Frank Fowler (artist)|Frank Fowler]] founded an artists' colony on The Enclosure, a dead-end street that is near the Third River, a stream that runs through the town's parks. Later artist residents of the street included [[Frederick Dana Marsh]], [[Reginald Marsh (artist)|Reginald Marsh]] and muralist [[Michael Lenson]].<ref>Bailinson, Frank.
