'''Temple Israel''' is a [[Reform Judaism (North America)|Reform Jewish]] congregation in [[Memphis, Tennessee]]. It is the only Reform [[synagogue]] in Memphis, the oldest and largest Jewish congregation in Tennessee, and one of the largest Reform congregations in the United States. It was founded in 1853 by mostly [[German Jews]] as Congregation B'nai Israel (Hebrew for "Children of Israel"). Led initially by [[Hazzan|cantors]], in 1858 it hired its first [[rabbi]], Jacob Peres, and leased its first building, which it renovated and eventually purchased.

Peres was fired in 1860 because he opened a store that conducted business on Saturdays, the [[Shabbat|Jewish Sabbath]]. He was replaced by Simon Tuska, who moved the congregation from [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox]] to Reform practices. Tuska died in 1871, and was succeeded by Max Samfield; under his leadership, the synagogue was one of the founding members of the [[Union for Reform Judaism]]. In 1884, Children of Israel completed a new building, and membership grew rapidly. Samfield died in 1915, and was succeeded by Bill Fineshriber, an outspoken supporter of [[Women's suffrage in the United States|women's suffrage]] and equal rights for African Americans. The following year the congregation moved to a new building, where membership continued to grow. Fineshriber left in 1924, and was succeeded by Harry Ettelson.

The synagogue experienced difficulty during the [[Great Depression]]<U+2014>membership dropped, the congregational school was closed, and staff had their salaries reduced<U+2014>but conditions had improved by the late 1930s. In 1943 the synagogue changed its name to Temple Israel, and by the late 1940s membership had almost doubled from its low point in the 1930s. Ettelson retired in 1954, and was succeeded by Jimmy Wax.

Wax became known for his activism during the [[African-American Civil Rights Movement (1955<U+2013>1968)|Civil Rights era]]. Though some members<U+2014>particularly those whose families had lived in the South for generations<U+2014>had segregationist views, others were prominent in the fight for black civil rights. During Wax's tenure, most of Temple Israel's members moved far from the existing synagogue, and in 1976 the congregation constructed its current building, closer to where most members lived. Wax retired in 1978, and was succeeded by Harry Danziger, who brought traditional practices back to the congregation. He retired in 2000, and was succeeded by Micah Greenstein. {{As of|2010}}, Temple Israel has almost 1,600 member families. Greenstein is the senior rabbi, and the cantor is John Kaplan.

Born in Germany in 1824, he had emigrated to the United States at age 16, and moved to Memphis in 1854. There he taught music, performed, and composed works for B'nai Israel's services; by 1894 he had completed over 850 pieces for the congregation.<ref name=Sharp2007p22-24>[[#refSharp2007|Sharp (2007)]], pp.&nbsp;22<U+2013>24.</ref>

In its first decades, the congregation worshiped in various locations in downtown Memphis, near the [[Mississippi River]] waterfront. It received a $2,000 (today ${{formatnum:{{inflation|US|2000|1853|r=-3}}}}) bequest from the estate of New Orleans philanthropist [[Judah Touro]], and used it to purchase a lot on Second Street, but did not feel financially secure enough to build a synagogue, and eventually sold the property.<ref name=TouroBequest>[[#refAdlerSamfield1904|Adler & Samfield (1904)]], pp.&nbsp;463<U+2013>464, [[#refISJL2006TI|History of Temple Israel, Institute of Southern Jewish Life (2006)]], [[#refRingel2004|Ringel (2004)]], p.&nbsp;3.</ref> The congregation instead held services in members' homes in 1853, and subsequently (until 1857) rented various premises on Front Street.<ref name=EarlyBuildings>[[#refLewis1998|Lewis (1998)]], p.&nbsp;9; [[#refOlitzkyRaphael1996|Olitzky & Raphael (1996)]], p.&nbsp;337; [[#refRingel2004|Ringel (2004)]], p.&nbsp;3.</ref> The Touro funds eventually enabled the members to lease the Farmers and Merchants Bank building at Main and Exchange streets in late 1857, which they converted to a synagogue.<ref name=BankBuilding>[[#refRingel2004|Ringel (2004)]], p.&nbsp;3.

[[#refAdlerSamfield1904|Adler & Samfield (1904)]], pp.&nbsp;463<U+2013>464 describe it as "The Farmers' and Mechanics' Bank" and state that it was dedicated on March 26, 1858.</ref> Funds for the renovation were raised by two committees; one solicited donations from "all the Israelites in this city", while the other's task was "to receive subscriptions from Gentiles". Additional funds were raised by selling members reserved seats in the new sanctuary. An auction was held on March 18, 1858, in which 50 men's seats were sold for $343 (today ${{formatnum:{{inflation|US|343|1858|r=-2}}}}), and 44 women's' seats for $158 (today ${{formatnum:{{inflation|US|158|1858|r=-2}}}}). The renovated premises had seating for 150 men and approximately 50 women.<ref name=FarmersMerchangtsSeating>[[#refRingel2004|Ringel (2004)]], p.&nbsp;3; [[#refLewis1998|Lewis (1998)]], p.&nbsp;9 states the women's section had seating for 46.</ref> In 1860, the congregation contracted to purchase the property; by 1865, it owned it outright and was debt-free.<ref name=MortgagePaidOff>[[#refLewis1998|Lewis (1998)]], p.&nbsp;9.

It described the building as the "First Permanent Jewish House of Worship in Tennessee".<ref name=Marker/><ref name=Ringel2004p3>[[#refRingel2004|Ringel (2004)]], p.&nbsp;3.</ref>

Membership in B'nai Israel was restricted to men, and attendance at the (at least) quarterly meetings was mandatory. Men who missed a meeting without a reasonable excuse were fined.<ref name=MeetingsFines>[[#refRingel2004|Ringel (2004)]], pp.&nbsp;3<U+2013>4. In 1857 the fine was $0.50 (today ${{formatnum:{{inflation|US|.5|1857|r=0}}}}).</ref> The members also instituted rules intended to guard the image of the small Jewish congregation in the eyes of the much larger Christian community. New members had to be approved by a secret ballot, and existing members could [[Blackballing|blackball]] candidates.  A member could also be suspended or expelled if he acted in a disreputable manner.<ref name=Ringel2004p4/>

B'nai Israel was the only Jewish congregation in Memphis, and members were split between traditionalists and reformers from the beginning.<ref name=Lewis1998p10>[[#refLewis1998|Lewis (1998)]], p.&nbsp;10.</ref> When remodeling their new building, the congregation voted eighteen to fourteen to maintain traditional [[mechitza|separate seating for men and women]].<ref name=ISJL2006TI>[[#refISJL2006TI|History of Temple Israel, Institute of Southern Jewish Life (2006)]].</ref> By 1858, with enough funds to hire a full-time spiritual leader, they consulted Rabbi [[Isaac Leeser]], the leader of America's Orthodox Jewish community, but were also in contact with Rabbi [[Isaac Mayer Wise]], the leader of America's fledgling Reform movement, who had dedicated B'nai Israel's sanctuary earlier that year.<ref name=FirstRabbi>For accumulating enough funds, see [[#refRingel2004|Ringel (2004)]], p.&nbsp;4.

Peres, an Orthodox rabbi.<ref name=Peres>[[#refLewis1998|Lewis (1998)]], pp.&nbsp;9<U+2013>10, [[#refRingel2004|Ringel (2004)]], p.&nbsp;4.</ref>

== Peres era (1858<U+2013>1860) ==
[[File:Rabbi Jacob J. Peres.jpg|thumb|150px|right|Rabbi Jacob J. Peres|alt=The head of a man with a long curly full beard, his hair parted on his left.]]
Born and raised in the Netherlands, Peres had been a child prodigy who, before turning eighteen, had edited a Hebrew grammar, as well as a volume of proverbs written in five languages. Upon graduation from high school, he had been given a [[stipend]] by [[William I of the Netherlands]] to attend the Netherlands Israelitish Seminary, where he pursued both secular and rabbinic studies.<ref name=Ringel2004p4/><ref name=Lewis1998p10/> He was well-versed in mathematics, language, literature and law, and co-founded Peres and Micou, a legal firm.<ref name=Lewis1998p10/>

B'nai Israel hired Peres in December 1858 as cantor and teacher, in English and German, at an annual salary of $600 (today ${{formatnum:{{inflation|US|600|1858|r=-3}}}}) with perquisites of $400.<ref name=Peres/> By comparison, the kosher butcher's salary was $300, not including what he earned killing poultry.<ref name=Ringel2004p4/> Peres also ran the Hebrew school and the choir, and was in effect the rabbi.<ref name=Ringel2004p4/><ref name=HebrewSchoolEstablished/> Under his leadership, the membership took a serious interest in the plight of Jews around the world. For example, at a congregational meeting in January 1860, they gathered money from the members present and B'nai Israel's treasury to assist suffering [[Moroccan Jews]], and created a committee to raise funds throughout Memphis on their behalf. The congregation also moved more towards Orthodoxy, and passed a rule stating that only those members who were [[Shomer Shabbat|Sabbath observant]] could receive [[Torah reading#Procedure|Torah honors]] on the High Holy Days.<ref name=Ringel2004pp4-5>[[#refRingel2004|Ringel (2004)]], pp.&nbsp;4<U+2013>5.</ref>

Peres did not find his wages sufficient to support himself, his wife, and his four children. To supplement his income, he opened a grocery store and a [[Commission (remuneration)|commission]] business (selling others' goods on [[consignment]]) with his brother. As Saturday (the [[Shabbat|Jewish Sabbath]]) was also the busiest day for commerce, he decided to keep his business open on that day<U+2014>something forbidden by [[Rabbinically prohibited activities of Shabbat#Money|Jewish law]], and at odds with the rule he had championed. Some of congregants objected, and at B'nai Israel's April 1860 quarterly meeting, charges were brought against him; at a subsequent trial at a [[Beth din|Jewish court]], he was convicted and fired. In response, he sued the congregation in a civil court for lost wages and libel. The precedent-setting case, which reached the [[Tennessee Supreme Court]], was decided in his favor as regards the lost income, but against him regarding libel. The court's ruling was that "a religious institution is sovereign; that its laws and regulations are supreme; and that its policies and practices may not be challenged by a legal action in a court of law".<ref name=Lewis1998p10/>

After Peres's dismissal, the members began a search for what they called a "Moderate Reform" rabbi. This time, they consulted Wise, not Leeser. The position was advertised in Wise's newspaper as a "Teacher, Preacher, and Reader", paying $1,000 (today ${{formatnum:{{inflation|US|1000|1860|r=-3}}}}) per year. Qualifications included the ability to "instruct children in Hebrew, lecture once a week in German or English and read the Prayers properly."<ref name=Lewis1998p11>[[#refLewis1998|Lewis (1998)]], p.&nbsp;11.</ref> In 1860, they hired Simon Tuska.<ref name=Lewis1998p25>[[#refLewis1998|Lewis (1998)]], p.&nbsp;25.</ref> Peres stayed in Memphis, and the theological tensions within the congregation were resolved when forty of the more traditional members departed; with Peres as their spiritual leader, they formed the Orthodox Beth El Emeth congregation in the early 1860s.<ref name=BethElEmethFormed>[[#refLewis1998|Lewis (1998)]], p.&nbsp;11 gives the year as 1861. [[#refRingel2004|Ringel (2004)]], p.&nbsp;6 gives it as 1862.</ref> This division process was common to many American congregations of the time.<ref name="Lewis1998p11"/>

== Tuska era (1860<U+2013>1871) ==
[[File:Rabbi Simon Tuska.jpg|thumb|150px|left|Rabbi Simon Tuska|alt=The head of a man with a large forehead and receding hair, a mustache and [[soul patch]], and long thick sideburns, wearing small wire-rimmed glasses and a dark bow-tie.]]
Born in [[Veszpr<U+00E9>m]], Hungary in 1835, Tuska was raised in Rochester, New York, where his father was a rabbi. Simon attended the [[Colgate Rochester Crozer Divinity School|Rochester Theological Seminary]], and upon completion of his studies there in 1858, was sent to the [[Jewish Theological Seminary of Breslau]] to get rabbinic training.<ref name=TuskaBreslau>According to [[#refLewis1998|Lewis (1998)]], p.&nbsp;24. [[#refRingel2004|Ringel (2004)]], p.&nbsp;7 writes that Tuska went to the Jewish Theological Seminary of Breslau for two years "[f]ollowing his graduation from the University of Rochester in 1856".</ref> He did not graduate from the seminary, instead returning to the United States in 1860 to apply for a position at [[Congregation Emanu-El of New York]], but he was turned down because of his small size and weak voice.<ref name=Lewis1998p25/> He then applied to Temple Israel, where on July 1, 1860, he was unanimously elected and signed a three-year contract at $800 (today ${{formatnum:{{inflation|US|800|1860|r=-3}}}}) per year.<ref name=TuskaJoins>[[#refRingel2004|Ringel (2004)]], p.&nbsp;7. For Tuska applying, see [[#refLewis1998|Lewis (1998)]], p.&nbsp;25.</ref> He proved to be very popular with the congregation; in January 1863, six months before the three-year contract was up for renewal, he was re-elected as rabbi for a ten-year term, and his salary rose to $1,500 per year.<ref name=Ringel2004p9>[[#refRingel2004|Ringel (2004)]], p.&nbsp;9.</ref>

Tuska reformed services at B'nai Israel, removing ''[[piyyut]]im'' (liturgical poems) in 1861, adding an organ and mixed-gender choir in 1862, and [[Reform Judaism (North America)#Confirmation ceremonies|confirmation ceremonies]] in 1863.<ref name=TuskaReforms>[[#refRingel2004|Ringel (2004)]], p.&nbsp;7; [[#refLewis1998|Lewis (1998)]], p.&nbsp;25; [[#refAdlerSamfield1904|Adler & Samfield (1904)]], p.&nbsp;464; [[#refISJL2006TI|History of Temple Israel, Institute of Southern Jewish Life (2006)]].

Tuska supported slavery, describing the [[Abolitionism|abolitionist]] views of [[Henry Ward Beecher]] and others as "rabid", and like most members of B'nai Israel, after hostilities broke out between the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] and the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]], he supported [[Tennessee in the American Civil War#Tennessee secedes|secession from the Union]].<ref>[[#refRingel2004|Ringel (2004)]], p.&nbsp;9; [[#refLewis1998|Lewis (1998)]], p.&nbsp;32.</ref> More than ten members of the congregation volunteered for the Confederate Army after war broke out, and they were given special honors and blessings at a ceremony during Sabbath services.<ref name=Ringel2004p10-11>[[#refRingel2004|Ringel (2004)]], pp.&nbsp;10<U+2013>11.</ref> Many Memphis schools were forced to close because of the Civil War; in response, B'nai Israel established the Hebrew Educational Institute in 1864.<ref name=HEIestablished>According to [[#refOlitzkyRaphael1996|Olitzky & Raphael (1996)]], p.&nbsp;337;[[#refRingel2004|Ringel (2004)]], p.&nbsp;4.

In 1872, Children of Israel purchased land on Adams Avenue, with the intent of building a new synagogue there, but financial pressures delayed the project, and in 1880 the congregation decided to sell the property and find a better one. They sold the lot in 1882, and instead purchased land on Poplar Avenue between Second and Third Streets.<ref name=Ringel2004p22>[[#refRingel2004|Ringel (2004)]], p.&nbsp;22.</ref> By 1884, they had completed a new synagogue building there, at a cost of $39,130 (today ${{formatnum:{{inflation|US|39130|1884|r=-3}}}}).<ref name=Lewis1998p62/> The [[Byzantine Revival architecture|Byzantine Revival]] structure had an impressive fa<U+00E7>ade featuring twin tall spires and a large round window containing a [[Star of David]].<ref name=ISJL2006TI/> The building helped attract new members; by 1885 an additional 45 had joined, for a total of 173 member families, and the congregation was again debt-free.<ref name=NewMembers1885>[[#refLewis1998|Lewis (1998)]], p.&nbsp;62; [[#refISJL2006TI|History of Temple Israel, Institute of Southern Jewish Life (2006)]].</ref> That year, the synagogue acquired a cemetery on Hernando Road.<ref name=HernandoCemetary>According to [[#refRingel2004|Ringel (2004)]], p.&nbsp;24, who states the land was acquired for $1,750, with an additional $2,000 spent on improvements that year, and $1,800 on landscaping and a chapel the following year. [[#refLewis1998|Lewis (1998)]], p.&nbsp;77 states that the land had been originally owned by Beth El Emeth, and was acquired in 1890 for $1,000.</ref>

Though the congregation continued to grow, most new Jewish immigrants to Memphis were from Eastern Europe, and more traditional than the members of Children of Israel.<ref name=ISJL2006Memphis/> As a result, they typically formed their own Orthodox synagogues, the oldest and longest-lasting of which was the Baron Hirsch Synagogue. Members of Children of Israel worked to assist the Eastern European Jews in assimilating into American society, providing financial assistance, free education on topics such as English, civics, and even hygiene, and from 1897 to 1907 they held a Sunday School for children of the Baron Hirsch congregation. In 1890, the membership of Children of Israel was 186 families, and the religious school had 148 students. To deal with persistent financial issues and attract younger members, in 1897 the congregation created a new class of member, the "seatholder", who could not be elected to any office, but paid less in return. This innovation was successful; 47 new members joined in 1898, and the congregation's total membership reached 222 families. Combined with cost cuts in other areas (primarily reducing the amount paid to the choir), this pulled the synagogue out of a four-year financial deficit.<ref name=Ringel2004pp29-30>[[#refRingel2004|Ringel (2004)]], pp.&nbsp;28<U+2013>31. The [[#refAJYearBookV2|''American Jewish Year Book'', Vol. 2]], p.&nbsp;462 indicates that in 1898/1899 Children of Israel had 185 member families, and congregational school had twelve teachers and around 130 students. These numbers, however, likely reflect the situation in 1897, and are almost identical to the figures given by Ringel for that year.</ref>

At the end of the nineteenth century, the synagogue's annual revenues were $7,500 (today ${{formatnum:{{inflation|US|7500|1900|r=-3}}}}).<ref name=AJYearBookV2p462>[[#refAJYearBookV2|''American Jewish Year Book'', Vol. 2]], p.&nbsp;462.</ref> Around this time the congregation stopped hiring cantors, relying instead on the organist and choir to lead prayer-singing.<ref name=Ringel2004p31/> By 1905, congregational membership had increased to 262, and by 1907 it was 285, and the synagogue's annual revenues were $8,500.<ref name=1905-1907>For 1905 figures, see [[#refISJL2006TI|History of Temple Israel, Institute of Southern Jewish Life (2006)]].

Fineshriber succeeded Samfield in 1915.<ref name=OlitzkyRaphael1996p337/><ref name=Kalin1997p53/> Born in [[St. Louis, Missouri]], in 1878, his father had been a Reform rabbi, who died at the age of 37. When Fineshriber was 13, he moved to Cincinnati on his own, where he attended high school. After graduating, he attended the [[University of Cincinnati]] and entered HUC's eight-year program. By 1900 he had graduated from both and been ordained.<ref name=Kalin1997p52>[[#refKalin1997|Kalin (1997)]], p.&nbsp;52.</ref> He accepted his first pulpit that year at Temple Emanuel in Davenport, Iowa, and joined Children of Israel in 1911 as associate rabbi.<ref name=OlitzkyRaphael1996p337/><ref name=Kalin1997p53/> He was the synagogue's first HUC graduate, and its first American-born rabbi.<ref name=Ringel2004p35/> He had a quick wit, and was able to speak eloquently and extemporaneously on almost any topic.<ref name=Kalin1997p54>[[#refKalin1997|Kalin (1997)]], p.&nbsp;54.</ref> Often quoted in the newspapers, he was active in the Memphis community, and was a [[Rotary International|Rotarian]], [[Ancient Arabic Order of the Nobles of the Mystic Shrine|Shriner]], and [[Freemasonry|Freemason]].<ref name=FineshriberActivities>For often being quoted in newspapers, see [[#refKalin1997|Kalin (1997)]], p.&nbsp;54. For membership in service organizations, see [[#refKalin1997|Kalin (1997)]], p.&nbsp;61.</ref> He was also an early suffragist, and took up the cause at Children of Israel. At a 1913 women's day event, featuring speakers from Louisiana, Arkansas, Mississippi and Tennessee, he was the only male speaker. At a 1914 rally he stated "Taxation without representation is tyranny... [The] purpose of this meeting... is to shock the people of Memphis into a realization that the question of equal suffrage is not child's play."<ref name=Kalin1997p54/>

He spoke out strongly against the [[lynching of Ell Persons]] in 1917. Persons, a black man accused of raping and decapitating a sixteen-year-old white girl, had been burned alive in front of a crowd of thousands in Memphis, and his remains dismembered, scattered, and displayed.<ref name=Kalin1997p56>[[#refKalin1997|Kalin (1997)]], p.&nbsp;56.</ref> Fineshriber called a congregational meeting to protest the lynching, convinced the membership to endorse a public condemnation of it, and acted as secretary to a group of clergymen who issued a statement decrying the practice.<ref name=CondemnLynching>[[#refKalin1997|Kalin (1997)]], p.&nbsp;57; [[#refISJL2006TI|History of Temple Israel, Institute of Southern Jewish Life (2006)]].</ref> He also convinced the editor of Memphis's largest newspaper, ''[[The Commercial Appeal]]'', to write an editorial criticizing the lynching.<ref name=Kalin1997pp57-58>[[#refKalin1997|Kalin (1997)]], pp.&nbsp;57<U+2013>58.</ref> Fineshriber supported other causes affecting African-Americans; he worked to improve their housing, spoke at black churches, and helped raise funds for them.<ref name=Kalin1997p60>[[#refKalin1997|Kalin (1997)]], p.&nbsp;60.</ref> He criticized the [[Ku Klux Klan]] from his pulpit, the only clergyman in Memphis to do so.

In 1922, in response to the attempt by [[William Jennings Bryan]] and his followers to ban the teaching of [[evolution]] in universities and public schools, Fineshriber devoted three Friday night sermons to discussing it. He emphasized to packed audiences the "inalienable right of free thought and free speech, guaranteed by the Constitution of the United States", and argued that "[t]he majority of thoughtful and liberal preachers of the world have found no difficulty in accepting the theory of evolution without discarding their Bibles or their religion. You can worship God only in the light of truth".<ref name=Ringel2004p47>[[#refRingel2004|Ringel (2004)]], p.&nbsp;47.</ref> Nevertheless, in 1925 Tennessee became the first state to [[Butler Act|ban the teaching of evolution]] in public schools, a law not repealed until 1967.<ref name=Ringel2004p48>[[#refRingel2004|Ringel (2004)]], p.&nbsp;48.</ref>

During Fineshriber's early years the congregation continued to modify its religious practices. At funerals, it encouraged mourners to leave the graveside, rather than having them wait until the coffin was lowered and cover it with earth themselves (as was the traditional practice). By this time, few members had [[bar mitzvah]] ceremonies for their 13-year-old boys; instead, boys and girls participated in the Reform [[Reform Judaism (North America)#Confirmation ceremonies|Confirmation ceremony]] (though the synagogue still allowed those who wanted bar mitzvah ceremonies to have them). In 1916, the congregation eliminated the observance of the eighth days of [[Passover]] and [[Sukkot]], required all worshipers to stand when mourners stood to recite the ''[[kaddish]]'', and restored the Orthodox practice of blessing and naming babies in the synagogue as part of the services.<ref name=Ringel2004pp44-45>[[#refRingel2004|Ringel (2004)]], pp.&nbsp;44<U+2013>45.</ref>

The money for the latter had been raised by the recently formed Ladies Auxiliary, whose most effective fund-raising activity involved selling home-cooked meals. The building also had an auditorium with a stage, and fourteen classrooms for the religious school.<ref name=ISJL2006TI/> Children of Israel's vacated building was purchased by a new Orthodox congregation that had adopted the name of the disbanded Beth El Emeth.<ref name=BethElEmethBuilding>[[#refISJL2006TI|History of Temple Israel, Institute of Southern Jewish Life (2006)]].

Ettelson was a strong supporter of the [[Pittsburgh Platform]] and its principles, which became the basis for what was later known as "classical" Reform Judaism. The services he led reflected that: member participation in the services (which were mostly in English) was limited.<ref name=ISJL2006TI/> While at Achduth Vesholom he moved services from Saturday to Sunday for a period, in an attempt to improve attendance.<ref name=OlitkzyRaphaelpp137-138>[[#refOlitzkyRaphael1996|Olitzky & Raphael (1996)]], pp.&nbsp;137<U+2013>138.</ref> Even before his joining Children of Israel, the congregation had already substantially reformed its services; it no longer held bar mitzvahs, observed the laws of ''[[kashrut]]'', or allowed congregants to participate in the [[Torah reading]]. Aside from the ''[[Shema Yisrael]]'' and ''[[Kaddish]]'', Hebrew or Aramaic prayers had been almost totally eliminated. Though he made few ritual changes himself,<ref name=Ringel2004p52>[[#refRingel2004|Ringel (2004)]], p.&nbsp;52.</ref> Ettelson continued this tradition, and emphasized community service over ritual practice, promoting Judaism as a universalist religion with a mission of justice and peace.<ref name=Ringel2004p51>[[#refRingel2004|Ringel (2004)]], p.&nbsp;51.</ref> The year he arrived he organized the Cross Cut Club, an inter-faith group intended to counter religious prejudice. He served as its first president, and was its president again in 1950. One of his initiatives there was the Union Civic Thanksgiving Service, an interdenominational eve-of-Thanksgiving service that was held for a number of years. In the 1930s it held an [[Racial integration|integrated]] meeting, and, as a result, was not invited back to the venue the following year.<ref name=CrossCut>[[#refLewis1998|Lewis (1998)]], p.&nbsp;122; [[#refLewis2002|Lewis (2002)]].</ref>

When Ettelson joined the congregation, it had 650 member families. To accommodate growth, in 1926 the synagogue built an annex for the children's religious school.<ref name=1926Annex>[[#refRingel2004|Ringel (2004)]], pp.&nbsp;52<U+2013>53. Half the cost, approximately $24,000 (today ${{formatnum:{{inflation|US|24000|1926|r=-4}}}}), was donated by synagogue president Joseph Newburger, and the rest was taken as a loan, which was paid off in 1928.</ref> That year the congregation also established the "Temple Men's Club", which had over 200 members, and joined the National Federation of Temple Brotherhoods.<ref name=Ringel2004p52/> In 1928, the congregation purchased an adjoining house south of the synagogue, for Junior Congregation meetings, and began broadcasting its Friday evening services on the radio.<ref name=Ringel2004p53>[[#refRingel2004|Ringel (2004)]], p.&nbsp;53. The amount paid for the house was $7,250.</ref> The costs for both endeavors were donated anonymously by synagogue member Abe Plough, founder and chairman of [[Schering-Plough]].<ref name=Ringel2004p54>[[#refRingel2004|Ringel (2004)]], p.&nbsp;54.</ref> The synagogue was hard-hit by the [[Great Depression]]. Income from dues dropped from $47,000 in 1928 (today ${{formatnum:{{inflation|US|47000|1928|r=-4}}}}) to $23,000 in 1932, and membership fell from 750 families in 1929 to as low as 629 families.<ref name=ISJL2006TI/> The [[Talmud Torah]] was closed due to lack of funds, and board meetings focused on finding ways to keep the congregation going financially. Ettelson requested a pay reduction of $1,000 (today ${{formatnum:{{inflation|US|1000|1931|r=-3}}}}) in 1931, and a further 10 percent cut in 1933, and the salaries of other synagogue employees were also cut.<ref name=Lewis1998p129>[[#refLewis1998|Lewis (1998)]], p.&nbsp;129.</ref><ref name=Ringel2004p55>[[#refRingel2004|Ringel (2004)]], p.&nbsp;55.</ref> The Junior Congregation did well, though; it had 189 paid members by 1933, held Saturday morning and High Holy Days services, and conducted a number of other programs.<ref name=Ringel2004p55/> The congregation eventually recovered as a whole, assisted by members who were leaders in the civic and business worlds.<ref name=ISJL2006TI/> By 1936, membership had increased to 650, and the synagogue paid off the remaining mortgage on the Poplar and Montgomery synagogue building.<ref name=Ringel2004p57>[[#refRingel2004|Ringel (2004)]], p.&nbsp;57. The amount paid was $40,000.</ref>

In 1932, Ettelson became locally famous for a debate he had at Nashville's [[Ellis Auditorium]] with Scopes Trial lawyer [[Clarence Darrow]] on whether or not religion was necessary. Ettelson argued in favor, Darrow against.<ref name=DarrowDebate>[[#refLewis1998|Lewis (1998)]], p.&nbsp;136; [[#refISJL2006TI|History of Temple Israel, Institute of Southern Jewish Life (2006)]].</ref> Friction between Ettelson and some board members came to a head in 1937, when the board discussed the issue of whether to retain him as rabbi; when invited to the meeting, he spoke briefly, then resigned. The board recommended that his tenure be put to a congregational vote at the next annual meeting, where he was re-elected in a secret ballot by a vote of 303 to 31. He took an eight-month medical leave in 1938, and Children of Israel hired Morton Cohn as assistant rabbi.<ref name=Ringel2004pp58-59>[[#refRingel2004|Ringel (2004)]], pp.&nbsp;58<U+2013>59.</ref>

The congregation was heavily involved in World War II, with many members serving in the armed forces, including Dudley Weinberg, who had succeeded Cohn as assistant rabbi. Children of Israel published a special newsletter for overseas members;<ref name=Ringel2004p62>[[#refRingel2004|Ringel (2004)]], p.&nbsp;62.</ref> by the end of the war, approximately four hundred congregants had served<U+2014>and fourteen had died<U+2014>in the U.S. military.<ref name=Israelowitz1988p119>[[#refIsraelowitz1988|Israelowitz (1988)]], p.&nbsp;119.</ref><ref name=ISJL2006TI/> As with many other Reform congregations, the members of Temple Israel were split on the issue of Zionism. It is likely that a majority were anti-Zionist, and the synagogue president joined the anti-Zionist [[American Council for Judaism]], though other prominent members supported Zionism, and still others were simply non-Zionist. Ettelson initially opposed Zionism, though he did not join the council. With the growth of [[antisemitism]] inside and outside the United States, his views changed, and he was an early member of the local chapter of the Zionist United Palestine Appeal. Nevertheless, he successfully kept the issue from becoming divisive at the temple.<ref name=EarlyZionism>[[#refLewis1998|Lewis (1998)]], p.&nbsp;126, [[#refISJL2006TI|History of Temple Israel, Institute of Southern Jewish Life (2006)]], [[#refRingel2004|Ringel (2004)]], pp.&nbsp;67<U+2013>69.</ref>

In 1943, the congregation changed its name to Temple Israel.<ref>[[#refLaPointe1997|LaPointe (1997)]], p.&nbsp;362, n.&nbsp;8.</ref> Its membership grew rapidly, from 914 families in 1944 to over 1,100 by late 1949, together with an increase in the number of children in line with the post-war [[post-World War II baby boom|baby boom]]. In 1951 the temple added a new education building, which had 22 classrooms, offices, and a library. That year the congregation also updated the synagogue's kitchen, added air conditioning for the vestry and auditorium, and the same for the sanctuary in 1953.<ref>[[#refRingel2004|Ringel (2004)]], pp.&nbsp;64<U+2013>66; [[#refISJL2006TI|History of Temple Israel, Institute of Southern Jewish Life (2006)]].</ref> Ettelson retired the following year, and was succeeded as senior rabbi by James Wax.<ref name=LaPointe1997pp154-155>[[#refLaPointe1997|LaPointe (1997)]], pp.&nbsp;154<U+2013>155.</ref>

== Wax era (1954<U+2013>1978) ==
Born in 1912, James Aaron "Jimmy" Wax was raised in [[Herculaneum, Missouri]], where his was usually the only Jewish family in town. While attending [[Washington University in St. Louis]], he was inspired by Rabbi Ferdinand Isserman of Temple Israel of St. Louis to become a rabbi, as a means of achieving social justice. Because of financial constraints brought on by the Depression, Wax had to finish his undergraduate schooling at [[Southeast Missouri State University|Southeast Missouri State Teachers College]], where he graduated with a B.A. in 1935.<ref name=LaPointe1997pp154-155/> Mentored by Isserman, he then applied to HUC. Because he had little background in Hebrew, he did intensive work in the language prior to and during his admission, and was eventually ordained and achieved a Master of Hebrew Letters degree there in 1941.<ref name=LaPointe1997p156>[[#refLaPointe1997|LaPointe (1997)]], p.&nbsp;156.</ref> Turned down as a U.S. [[Military Chaplain|military chaplain]], from 1941 to 1945 he served at United Hebrew Congregation in St. Louis, and at [[North Shore Congregation Israel]] in Glencoe, Illinois.<ref name=LaPointe1997p156/><ref name=Ringel2004pp72-73>[[#refRingel2004|Ringel (2004)]], pp.&nbsp;72<U+2013>73.</ref> In 1946, he became assistant rabbi of Temple Israel, and in 1947 was promoted to associate rabbi.<ref name=ISJL2006TI/> In the early 1950s he was twice elected president of the Memphis and Shelby County Mental Health Society.<ref name=Lewis1998p182>[[#refLewis1998|Lewis (1998)]], p.&nbsp;182.</ref> Upon Ettelson's retirement in 1954, Wax become senior rabbi.<ref name=Olitzky338ISJL>[[#refOlitzkyRaphael1996|Olitzky & Raphael (1996)]], p.&nbsp;338; [[#refISJL2006TI|History of Temple Israel, Institute of Southern Jewish Life (2006)]].</ref>

[[File:Rabbi James Wax.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Rabbi James Wax|alt=The head of a clean-shaven man wearing a white shirt and light tie, covered by a dark robe.]]
By this time the synagogue had around 1,200 member families, and over 600 children in its religious school. Wax initiated some changes in the congregation's religious practices. One was to have a real ram's horn ''[[shofar]]'' blown on [[Rosh Hashanah]] starting in 1954, rather than the trumpet that had been used for a number of years. Under his leadership a number of members also started having bar mitzvah ceremonies for their children, though this did not become common until the 1970s. By the 1970s he had also added Hebrew classes to the religious school.<ref name=Ringel2004p76>[[#refRingel2004|Ringel (2004)]], pp.&nbsp;75<U+2013>76, 88.</ref> 

In 1955 he supported and raised funds for the creation of Memphis's first [[Conservative Judaism|Conservative]] synagogue, Beth Sholom, so that Conservative Jews would have their own place to worship.<ref name=CohenFerris2005p236>[[#refCohenFerris2005|Cohen Ferris (2005)]], p.&nbsp;236.</ref> By 1964, four assistant rabbis had succeeded Wax; Milton G. Miller, Robert Blinder, Sandford Seltzer, and Sylvin Wolf. That year Wax added Torah readings to the Friday evening service, and Temple Israel's board began purchasing [[State of Israel Bonds]]; in the wake of the 1967 [[Six-Day War]], the board resolved to buy Israel Bonds "to the maximum feasible extent".<ref name=Ringel2004p81>[[#refRingel2004|Ringel (2004)]], pp.&nbsp;81<U+2013>82.</ref> By 1970 Wax had introduced services to celebrate ''[[Yom Ha'atzmaut]]'' and commemorate [[Yom HaShoah|Holocaust Remembrance Day]]. Though he initially resisted the idea of having a cantor, he eventually accepted a limited role for one, and in 1971 Thomas Schwartz was hired as Temple Israel's first full-time cantor/musical director in 80 years. Schwartz's salary was not paid by the synagogue, but was instead paid privately by a group of its members.<ref name=Ringel2004p88>[[#refRingel2004|Ringel (2004)]], p.&nbsp;88.</ref> In 1978, Wax received the National Human Relations Award from the Memphis Round Table of the [[National Conference of Christians and Jews]].<ref name=LaPointe1997p165/> He retired a few weeks later, though he served as acting rabbi of Temple Beth El in Helena, Arkansas, visiting regularly from 1978 until his death in 1989.<ref name=WaxDeath>[[#refLeMaster1994|LeMaster (1994)]], p.&nbsp;359, [[#refLaPointe1997|LaPointe (1997)]], p.&nbsp;166.</ref>

=== Civil rights activism ===
The [[African-American Civil Rights Movement (1955<U+2013>1968)]] sparked extremist antisemitism in the South, and "Communist Jews" were blamed for destroying democracy following the [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court's]] decision in ''[[Brown v. Board of Education]]''. Southern Jews found themselves in a difficult position; they were a vulnerable minority whose status in Southern white society was marginal and conditional on their acceptance of the status quo.<ref name=Webb2003ppxiv-xv>[[#refWebb2003|Webb (2003)]], p.&nbsp;xiv<U+2013>xv.</ref> Because of these concerns, particularly after the 1958 [[bombing of the Hebrew Benevolent Congregation Temple]] in Atlanta, the congregation did not want Wax taking a public stand on civil rights. In addition, though Wax supported racial integration, not all his congregants did; according to Wax, "Almost all native-born Southerners whose families lived in the South for two or more generations have segregationist attitudes." <ref name=Webb2003pxvi>[[#refWebb2003|Webb (2003)]], p.&nbsp;xvi.</ref> Rather than getting involved in public protests, Wax worked with groups supporting integration, such as the Memphis Ministers Association. He also encouraged Temple Israel's members to join groups like the Panel of American Women, an interfaith and inter-racial group that spoke in favor of religious and racial tolerance at community events and whose Memphis chapter was founded by congregation member Jocelyn Wurzburg.<ref name=Ringel2004pp72-73/><ref name=CohenFerrisGreenberg2006p16>[[#refCohenFerrisGreenberg2006|Cohen Ferris & Greenberg (2006)]], p.&nbsp;16.</ref> Temple Israel member Myra Dreifus co-founded Memphis's Fund for Needy Schoolchildren in the 1960s. It helped provide food for hungry schoolchildren, primarily in black schools, and later expanded its efforts to include the distribution of free or discounted clothing and footwear.<ref name=Little2009pp35-40>[[#refLittle2009|Little (2009)]], pp.&nbsp;35<U+2013>40.</ref> The group had both white and black women as members, including members of Temple Israel, and because of Dreifus's role in the Fund, Temple Israel itself supported it. By 1968, members of the Sisterhood were donating money so that tutors could be bussed to the majority African-American Kansas Street School. According to professor of women's and gender studies Kimberly K. Little, this "marked the first occasion where Temple Israel opened its doors to community<U+2013>based programs; its prior charitable work focused on Jewish community outreach."<ref name=Little2009pp61-62>[[#refLittle2009|Little (2009)]], pp.&nbsp;61<U+2013>62.</ref>

Wax was particularly involved with Memphis Committee on Community Relations (MMCR). The MMCR was formed in 1958 by a group of Memphis city leaders, with a goal of ending segregation in a non-violent way. Individual committees worked to desegregate various public facilities in Memphis. The MMCR also worked to get blacks representation in government (both elected and appointed officials), and created programs to improve economic conditions and job opportunities for blacks. Wax served as the MMCR's secretary from its formation until its dissolution in the 1970s. Several other Temple Israel members worked with the MMCR, and, as owners of large Memphis companies, were able to implement desegregation in their own workplaces.<ref name=LaPointe1997p159>[[#refLaPointe1997|LaPointe (1997)]], p.&nbsp;159.</ref> Other Temple Israel members supported the civil rights movement: senior business executives convinced stores to hire black salespeople, Herschel Feibelman chaired the Memphis War on Poverty Committee, and Marvin Ratner left a partnership at a prominent local law firm to form, along with two white and two black lawyers, Memphis's first integrated law firm.<ref name=Ringel2004pp72-73/>

In January 1965, Memphis mayor William B. Ingram asked Wax to join his Community Action Committee, a group which tried to get federal funding for anti-poverty programs and job training for black youths. In August of that year, Wax became chair of its policy committee, a mostly black group. Though the committee created a number of helpful programs, disagreement over the mayor's role in choosing members and controlling funds led to the group's dissolution in January 1966. Ingram lauded Wax's efforts on behalf of the group.<ref name=LaPointe1997pp159160>[[#refLaPointe1997|LaPointe (1997)]], pp.&nbsp;159<U+2013>160.</ref> Wax was also active in other civil rights groups, including the Tennessee Council on Human Relations, the [[American Civil Liberties Union]], the Memphis Urban League, and the Program of Progress, a group which worked to reform local government.<ref name=LaPointe1997p160>[[#refLaPointe1997|LaPointe (1997)]], p.&nbsp;160.</ref> He was elected president of the Memphis Ministers Association in May 1967, even though he was its only Jewish member.<ref name=LaPointe1997p162>[[#refLaPointe1997|LaPointe (1997)]], p.&nbsp;162.</ref> 

On January 31, 1968, two Memphis sanitation workers were crushed to death in a malfunctioning garbage compactor, prompting the start of the [[Memphis Sanitation Strike]] on February 12. The mostly black sanitation workers were Memphis's lowest paid civil servants, and received no overtime or holiday pay.<ref name=LaPointe1997p161>[[#refLaPointe1997|LaPointe (1997)]], p.&nbsp;161.</ref> Memphis's mayor was now [[Henry Loeb]], a former member of Temple Israel, who converted to Christianity soon after starting his term in 1968, after marrying an Episcopalian woman.<ref name=ISJL2006Memphis/><ref name=Kousser1999p181>[[#refKousser1999|Kousser (1999)]], p.&nbsp;181.</ref> He refused to negotiate with the workers, and the strike soon came to national attention as a civil rights issue.<ref name=LaPointe1997p161/> After being contacted by black ministers, Wax arranged a meeting on February 18 between Loeb, local union leaders, and [[Jerome Wurf|Jerry Wurf]], head of the [[American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees]]. The talks, which continued until 5:00am on the 19th, and resumed later that day, resolved nothing.<ref name=LaPointe1997p163>[[#refLaPointe1997|LaPointe (1997)]], p.&nbsp;163.</ref> Temple Israel member Dreifus used her past support for Loeb in his 1967 mayoralty campaign as a means of trying to force him to resolve the strike, and act as a representative of both white and black Memphians.<ref name=Little2009p64>[[#refLittle2009|Little (2009)]], p.&nbsp;64.</ref> The strike continued through March. In an attempt to defuse tension, Wax called a meeting of Memphis's two clergy groups, the mostly white Memphis Ministers Association and the black Interdenominational Alliance for April 3.<ref name=LaPointe1997p164>[[#refLaPointe1997|LaPointe (1997)]], pp.&nbsp;162, 164.</ref> The meeting, if anything, had the opposite effect; the black ministers wanted to march immediately on the mayor's office, while most of the white clergy, including Wax, refused to join the march, which they argued would just inflame the white public.<ref name=LaPointe1997p164/>

[[Martin Luther King, Jr.]] was assassinated in Memphis the next night. The Memphis Ministers Association organized a memorial service for King on the 5th. At the service, the ministers voted to march to Loeb's office that day and insist he address the workers' grievances and end the strike; led by Wax and William Dimmick, the dean of St. Mary's Cathedral, 250 clergymen marched in pairs to Loeb's office, where he was urged in front of television cameras to end the strike.<ref name=LaPointe1997p153>[[#refLaPointe1997|LaPointe (1997)]], p.&nbsp;153.</ref> In his sermon at Temple Israel, Wax told the congregation: "This city shall witness a new spirit and the memory of this great prophet of our time shall be honored. There will be bigots and segregationists and the so-called respectable but unrighteous people who will resist. But in the scheme of history, God's will does prevail."<ref name=CohenFerrisGreenberg2006p16/> The strike was settled on April 16, with the sanitation workers getting union recognition and other benefits.<ref name=LaPointe1997p165>[[#refLaPointe1997|LaPointe (1997)]], p.&nbsp;165.</ref> The only remaining impediment was a recommended ten-cent-an-hour raise on May 1, followed by another raise on September 1. The city budget did not have the estimated $558,000 (today ${{formatprice|{{inflation|US|558000|1968|r=-5}}}}) required to pay the workers. To resolve the impasse, Temple Israel member Abe Plough donated the shortfall anonymously.<ref name=Plough>[[#refLewis1998|Lewis (1998)]], p.&nbsp;88; [[#refISJL2006TI|History of Temple Israel, Institute of Southern Jewish Life (2006)]].</ref>

By 1957 the synagogue sanctuary, which had been designed for 350 families, had become too small to accommodate Temple Israel's over 1,100 member families. In addition, since the 1950s Memphis's Jewish community had been steadily moving from the downtown, where Temple Israel's Poplar Avenue building was located, to the eastern suburbs; by 1957 over half of the members, and three quarters of those with children in the congregational school, lived there. School attendance increased rapidly, and the student body soon outgrew its 1951 building. The school had to split attendance in 1959, with the younger children attending on Saturday and the older ones on Sunday,<ref name=ISJL2006TI/> and by 1961, 780 children were enrolled.<ref>[[#refRingel2004|Ringel (2004)]], pp.&nbsp;79<U+2013>80.</ref> In the early 1960s, Temple Israel began holding weekday classes at Beth Sholom, which was closer to most members.<ref name=ISJL2006TI/>

In 1963, Temple Israel drew up plans for a new building, and in 1964 purchased land on White Station Road.<ref name=Olitzky338ISJL/> In 1966, the members voted against building there, as older members were attached to the existing building, and concerned about expenses,<ref name=ISJL2006TI/> but by the early 1970s, the situation could no longer be ignored. Plough offered to donate one quarter of the $4 million cost of a new building.<ref name=PloughOffer>[[#refISJL2006TI|History of Temple Israel, Institute of Southern Jewish Life (2006)]]. Plough offered $1 million (today ${{formatprice|{{inflation|US|1000000|1974|r=-5}}}}) towards a new building, if fifteen more donors would donate $1.5 million, and the rest of the congregation another $1.5 million.</ref> The land on White Station Road was sold, and a {{convert|30|acre|adj=on}} property on East Massey Road was purchased;<ref name=WhiteStationSold>[[#refRingel2004|Ringel (2004)]], p.&nbsp;90.

According to [[#refRingel2004|Ringel (2004)]], p.&nbsp;92, Temple Israel wanted $1 million for the old synagogue building and property, and reduced its asking price to $940,000, but the purchasers could only raise $800,000.

The sanctuary, which sat up to 1,500, was semi-circular in shape, and designed so that no worshiper was more than fifteen rows from the [[Torah ark]].<ref name=SanctuaryCapacity>In [[#refRedstone1984|Redstone (1984)]], p.&nbsp;76, the architect states that the sanctuary "accommodat[es] 1335 people".

In 2003, the congregation embarked on a significant renovation and expansion of its facility. Over {{convert|100000|sqft}} of space, including the social hall, was renovated, and a {{convert|25000|sqfoot}} early childhood and family center addition was built, creating a U-shaped wing around a courtyard. Architect Walt Reed of The Crump Firm said he kept the emphasis on "simple, geometric, contemporary forms" that existed in the original building, as well as using the same copper roofing and detailing materials. The approximately $15 million construction project took two years, and was completed in 2007.<ref name=Scruggs2007/> "Wings to the Heavens", [[David Ascalon]]'s {{convert|30|foot|adj=mid}}-high, welded aluminum and stainless steel abstract [[Kinetic art#Kinetic sculpture|kinetic sculpture]], was installed in the atrium.<ref name=Ascalon2010>[[#refAscalon2010|Ascalon (2010)]].</ref>

== Danziger era (1978<U+2013>2000), 21st century ==
[[File:Rabbi Harry Danziger.jpg|thumb|150px|right|Rabbi Harry Danziger|alt=The head and shoulders of a smiling clean-shaven man with graying hair, wearing tinted aviator-style glasses, and a tie and suit jacket with pin-stripes.]]
Harry K. Danziger succeeded Wax as rabbi in 1978.<ref name=Olitzky338ISJL/> The son of a rabbi, Danziger was a graduate of the University of Cincinnati, and ordained by the HUC.<ref name=DanzigerBio>For rabbi's son, see [[#refRingel2004|Ringel (2004)]], pp.&nbsp;99<U+2013>100. For education and ordination, see [[#refTIClergy|Clergy, Temple Israel website]].</ref> He joined Temple Israel as assistant rabbi in 1964, but in 1969 moved to Monroe, Louisiana to lead Congregation B'nai Israel.<ref name=Olitzky338ISJL/> He was replaced first by Howard Schwartz, then by Richard Birnholz.<ref name=SchwartzBirnholz>[[#refRingel2004|Ringel (2004)]], pp.&nbsp;87,&nbsp;99<U+2013>100.</ref> Birnholz tendered his resignation in 1973, and Wax began to think of retirement. Danziger, then at Baltimore's [[Temple Oheb Shalom (Baltimore, Maryland)|Temple Oheb Shalom]], was approached as Wax's successor, and returned to Temple Israel that year as associate rabbi.<ref name=Ringel2004pp99-100>[[#refRingel2004|Ringel (2004)]], pp.&nbsp;99<U+2013>100.</ref> Synagogue membership had been around 1,350 families from the mid-1960s, but increased after the move to East Massey Road.<ref name=Ringel2004p102>[[#refRingel2004|Ringel (2004)]], p.&nbsp;102.</ref> By Wax's retirement it had reached around 1,500,<ref name=Olitzky338ISJL/> and over half Memphis's 10,000 Jews were members of Temple Israel.<ref name=Ringel2004p102/>

In his first sermon as associate rabbi, Danziger said "we can afford to look Jewish after all these years and ... out of self-respect alone, we cannot afford not to". As senior rabbi he slowly brought more traditional observances back to Temple Israel, moving it away from the radicalism of "Classical Reform" Judaism.<ref name=ISJL2006TI/> These observances included the chanting of Torah blessings, a Torah procession through the sanctuary aisles,<ref name=ISJL2006TI/> fasting on ''Yom Kippur'', [[brit milah|circumcising]] baby boys, and saying the ''kaddish'' for the deceased.<ref name=Ringel2004pp99-100/> In 1979, he gradually replaced the old ''Union Prayer Book'' with the new ''[[Gates of Prayer]]'' [[siddur|prayer book]], and later began wearing a ''[[tallit]]'' while on the ''[[bimah]]''. The changes were not uncontroversial, and the latter prompted one member to resign in protest.<ref name=Ringel2004pp106-107>[[#refRingel2004|Ringel (2004)]], pp.&nbsp;106<U+2013>107.</ref> Though more traditional than his more recent predecessors, he was willing to perform intermarriages, but also counseled the couples as to the meaning of making a Jewish home.<ref name=JaffeMcClain1995p121>[[#refJaffeMcClain1995|Jaffe McClain (1995)]], p.&nbsp;121.</ref> Danziger was involved in the Central Conference of American Rabbis and eventually became its president.<ref name=Fishkoff2006>[[#refFishkoff2006|Fishkoff (2006)]].</ref>

John Kaplan joined as cantor in 1981, and made the services less formal and more interactive.<ref name=ISJL2006TI/> His innovations included bringing in more modern tunes, encouraging congregational singing, and accompanying the services with a guitar, rather than the organ.<ref name=Ringel2004p110>[[#refRingel2004|Ringel (2004)]], p.&nbsp;110.</ref> By 2006, Friday night services included a "spirit" service, at which a [[house band]] played.<ref name=Fishkoff2006/>

During Danziger's tenure, assistant rabbis included Alan Greenbaum (1977<U+2013>1981), Harry Rosenfeld (1981<U+2013>1984), Constance Abramson Golden<U+2014>Temple Israel's first female rabbi<U+2014>(1984<U+2013>1986), and Marc Belgrad (1986<U+2013>1991).<ref name=Ringel2004p111>[[#refRingel2004|Ringel (2004)]], p.&nbsp;111.</ref> Micah D.

Kennedy School of Government]], he was ordained by the HUC. On Danziger's retirement in 2000, he became senior rabbi.<ref name=TIClergy/> An advocate for social justice, he tried to convince the Shelby County Commission to pass a law forbidding discrimination against gays, lesbians, and the transgendered, and has used the Bible to present counter-arguments to those supporting such discrimination based on Biblical verses.<ref name=Wolff2009>[[#refWolff2009|Wolff (2009)]].</ref> He has served twice as president of the Memphis Ministers Association, and sits on the boards of several local non-profit organizations.<ref name=Lindberg2009>[[#refLindberg2009|Lindberg (2009)]].</ref>

Grossman, a graduate of [[Ohio State University|Ohio State]] and [[Xavier University|Xavier]] universities, and ordained at HUC, joined as assistant rabbi in June 2008. He had previously served as a rabbinic intern at Dayton, Ohio's [[Temple Israel (Dayton, Ohio)|Temple Israel]]. Katie M. Bauman, a graduate of [[Washington University in St. Louis]], and ordained at HUC, joined as assistant rabbi in July 2009. She had previously served in rabbinic roles in Natchez, Mississippi and Marion, Ohio, as a cantor in Cincinnati, Ohio's [[Rockdale Temple]], and in 2003<U+2013>2004, as Temple Israel's Artist and Educator in Residence.<ref name=TIClergy/>

Temple Israel experienced modest fluctuations in membership during the 1990s and 2000s, and approximately half the Jews attending services in Memphis worshiped there.<ref name=Finlayson2008pp284-285>[[#refFinlayson2008|Finlayson (2008)]], pp.&nbsp;284<U+2013>285.</ref> In 1995, membership was over 1,700 family units, and by 2004, it had reached 1,800, and the religious school had 800 students.<ref name=Membership1995-2004>For 1995 membership see [[#refOlitzkyRaphael1996|Olitzky & Raphael (1996)]], p.&nbsp;338.
