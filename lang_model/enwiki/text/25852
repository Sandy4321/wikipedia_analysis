'''''Streptococcus iniae''''' is a [[species]] of [[Gram-positive bacteria|Gram-positive]], [[coccus|sphere-shaped]] [[bacteria|bacterium]] belonging to the [[genus]] ''[[Streptococcus]]''. Since its isolation from an Amazon freshwater dolphin in the 1970s, ''S.&nbsp;iniae'' has emerged as a leading [[fish]] pathogen in [[aquaculture]] operations worldwide, resulting in over [[United States dollar|US$]]100M  in annual losses. Since its discovery, ''S.&nbsp;iniae'' infections have been reported in at least 27 species of cultured or wild fish from around the world. Freshwater and saltwater fish including [[tilapia]], [[red drum]], [[hybrid striped bass]], and [[rainbow trout]] are among those susceptible to infection by ''S.&nbsp;iniae''. Infections in fish manifest as [[meningoencephalitis]], skin lesions, and [[septicemia]].

''S.&nbsp;iniae'' has occasionally produced infection in humans, especially fish handlers of Asian descent. Human infections include [[sepsis]], [[toxic shock syndrome]], and inflammation of the [[cellulitis|skin]], [[discitis|intervertebral discs]], or [[endocarditis|inner layer of the heart]]. Identifying ''S.&nbsp;iniae'' in the laboratory can be difficult, since the conventional methods used to identify streptococci yield insufficient results. It cannot be grouped by the [[Rebecca Lancefield|Lancefield]] antigen method typically used to categorize ''Streptococci'' species. The two known [[serotype]]s can be distinguished biochemically by differences in [[enzyme]] activity. Several [[antibiotic]]s have been used to treat ''S.&nbsp;iniae'' infections.

==History==
''Streptococcus iniae'' was first isolated in 1972, from [[wikt:subcutaneous|subcutaneous]] [[abscess]]es in a captive specimen of [[Amazon River Dolphin]] (''Inia geoffrensis'') suffering from an infection known as "golf ball disease". The bacterium was found to be sensitive to [[beta-lactam antibiotics]], and the dolphin was treated successfully with [[penicillin]] and [[tylosin]]. The causative organism was recognized to be a new species of ''[[Streptococcus]]'', and was given the name ''Streptococcus iniae'' in 1976.<ref name=Pier1976/> Around this time, other streptococcal outbreaks occurred in Asia,<ref name=Kitao1981/><ref name=Minami1979/> and the US;<ref name=Plumb1974/> some of the strains associated with the Japanese outbreaks<ref name=Kitao1981/><ref name=Minami1979/><ref name=Nakatsugawa1983/> were later suggested to be ''S.&nbsp;iniae''.<ref name=Kitao1993/>

In the 1980s, a purported new species of ''Streptococcus'', named ''S.&nbsp;shiloi'', was identified as one of the causes of an epidemic of [[meningoencephalitis]] (an inflammation of the brain and its surrounding membranes) affecting farmed [[rainbow trout]] and [[Oreochromis|tilapia]] in Israel since 1986. Since ''S.&nbsp;shiloi'' was [[Hemolysis (microbiology)#Types of hemolysis|alpha-hemolytic]], had a [[GC-content|G+C% content]] of 37% and did not ferment sugar [[galactose]], it was not classified as ''S.&nbsp;iniae'', which is beta-hemolytic, has a G+C% content of 32%, and ferments galactose.<ref name=Eldar1994/> In 1995, ''S.&nbsp;shiloi'' was found in fact to be beta-hemolytic, and after [[DNA-DNA hybridization]] techniques with the [[American Type Culture Collection|ATCC]] [[type (biology)|type]] ''S.&nbsp;iniae'' and recalculation of the G+C% content, was reclassified by the same group as a [[synonym (taxonomy)|junior synonym]] of ''S.&nbsp;iniae''.<ref name=Eldar1995/>

[[Molecular phylogenetics|Phylogenetic analyses]] based on [[16S ribosomal RNA|16S]] [[ribosomal DNA]] suggest that ''S.&nbsp;iniae'' is closely related to other streptococcal pathogens of humans and animals.<ref name=Facklam2005/><ref name=Zlotkin1998/> Specifically, it is clustered in the pyogenic group, along with other pathogenic streptococci such as ''[[Streptococcus pyogenes|S.&nbsp;pyogenes]]'', ''[[Streptococcus agalactiae|S.&nbsp;agalactiae]]'', ''[[Streptococcus uberis|S.&nbsp;uberis]]'', ''[[Streptococcus canis|S.&nbsp;canis]]'', ''[[Streptococcus porcinus|S.&nbsp;porcinus]]'', ''[[Streptococcus phocae|S.&nbsp;phocae]]'', and ''[[Streptococcus intestinalis|S.&nbsp;intestinalis]]''. Of these related species, it is most closely related to ''S. porcinus''.<ref name=Kawamura1995/><ref name=Poyart1998/> Genomic [[restriction fragment]] analysis of diverse host and geographical panels of ''S.&nbsp;iniae'' isolates has shown common profiles between virulent fish and human strains,<ref name=Facklam2005/><ref name=Nawawi2008/><ref name=Weinstein1997/> though multiple [[pulsed field gel electrophoresis]] patterns have been identified among human isolates.<ref name=Facklam2005/><ref name=Lau2003/>

==Identification==
[[File:Streptococcal hemolysis.jpg|thumb|Hemolyses of ''Streptococcus'' spp.<br />(left) &alpha;-hemolysis; (middle) &beta;-hemolysis; (right) &gamma;-hemolysis (= non-hemolytic)]]
''Streptococcus iniae''  may be easily misidentified (or not identified at all) by conventional automated microbiology systems. [[Molecular genetics]] methods, such as [[DNA sequencing]] and DNA-DNA hybridization, can be useful for correct identification, although work by the U.S. [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] has suggested they are unnecessary in most cases.<ref name=Facklam2005/> Several groups have used 16S rDNA sequencing to identify ''S.&nbsp;iniae'' isolates, and while it can differentiate this species from other related species, such as ''S.&nbsp;porcinus'' and ''S.&nbsp;uberis'', 16S sequencing cannot be used to differentiate between strains of ''S.&nbsp;iniae''.<ref name=Perera1994/><ref name=Eldar1997/><ref name=Facklam2002/>  [[Ribotyping]] is a similar method, by which 16S and 23S rRNA genes are digested with [[restriction endonuclease]]s and [[Southern blot]]ted using species-specific [[hybridization probe|oligonucleotide probes]].<ref name=Scott2002/> This method is more sensitive than 16S rDNA sequencing, as in addition to species differentiation, it can be used to differentiate between strains. Ribotyping was used in 1997 to differentiate between Israeli and American strains, thus ruling out the possibility of an [[epidemiology|epidemiological]] link between outbreaks in the two countries.<ref name=Eldar1997/>

''Streptococcus iniae'' is [[Hemolysis (microbiology)#Types of hemolysis|beta-hemolytic]] when incubated in [[wikt:anaerobic|anaerobic]] [[growth media|conditions]], although it may be misidentified as [[Hemolysis (microbiology)#Alpha|alpha-hemolytic]] because, in some strains, zones of beta-hemolysis (complete destruction of [[red blood cell]]s in the [[blood agar]] culture media) are surrounded by large zones of alpha-hemolysis (incomplete destruction of red blood cells with a greenish discoloration due to breakdown of [[hemoglobin]]).<ref name=MMWR/> The bacterium is [[Catalase#Catalase test|catalase-negative]] and [[Leucyl aminopeptidase|LAP]]-positive (like all streptococci), [[pyrrolidonyl arylamidase|PYR]]-test and [[CAMP test|CAMP-test]]-positive, does not hydrolyze [[sodium hippurate]] and does not grow in [[bile esculin agar]].<ref name=Goh/> It does not express any of the known [[Rebecca Lancefield|Lancefield antigen]]s.<ref name=Goh/>

===Serotypes===
There are two established [[serotype]]s of ''S.&nbsp;iniae''. The [[American Type Culture Collection|ATCC]]&nbsp;29178 type strain first characterized in 1976 by Pier and Madin<ref name=Pier1976/> is representative of Serotype I isolates. Serotype II was first identified as the [[type (biology)|type]] strain (ATCC&nbsp;29177) isolated from another dolphin case of "golf ball disease".<ref name=Pier1978/> A [[enzyme assay|biochemical assay]] measuring [[arginine dihydrolase]] activity has been used to distinguish between serotypes (Serotype I is positive),<ref name=Bachrach2001/> though proposed hyper-encapsulation of Serotype II may represent the most significant functional difference between the two types.<ref name=Barnes2001/>

==Role in disease==
===In fish===
[[File:Oncorhynchus mykiss.jpg|thumb|[[Epizootic]]s of ''S. iniae'' infection in rainbow trout (''healthy specimen pictured'') have occurred in Israel and Japan.<ref name=Kitao1981/><ref name=Lahav/>]]

''Streptococcus iniae'' is highly pathogenic in [[freshwater fish|freshwater]], marine, and [[euryhaline]] fish, and is highly lethal: outbreaks may be associated with 30<U+2013>50% mortality.<ref name=Low/> It is therefore one of the foremost economically important pathogens in intensive [[aquaculture]].<ref name=Agnew/><ref name=Locke/> In 1997, the global economic impact of ''S.&nbsp;iniae'' infection to the aquaculture industry was estimated at [[United States dollar|US$]]100&nbsp;million (one-tenth of which in the United States).<ref name=Agnew/> As of 2007, infection had been reported in twenty-seven species of fish, including [[tilapia]] (genus ''Oreochromis'' and ''Tilapia''), rainbow trout (''Oncorhynchus mykiss''), [[coho salmon]] (''Oncorhynchus kisutch''), [[Japanese amberjack]] (''Seriola quinqueradiata''), [[red drum]] (''Sciaenops ocellatus''), and [[barramundi]] (''Lates calcarifer'', which can be an [[asymptomatic carrier]]).<ref name=Weinstein1997/><ref name=Lau2003/><ref name=Bromage/> [[Common carp]] (''Cyprinus carpio''), [[channel catfish]] (''Ictalurus punctatus''), and [[goldfish]] (''Carassius auratus'') appear to be resistant.<ref name=Agnew/> Fish raised in intensive aquaculture operations and subject to environmental stressors (i.e. suboptimal temperature, poor water quality, crowding, handling, etc.) are most prone to ''S.&nbsp;iniae'' infection.<ref name=Bowser1998/><ref name=Ndong2007/><ref name=Perera1997/><ref name=Shoemaker2000/><ref name=Yuasa1999/> Wild fish populations located both near<ref name=Zlotkin1998/><ref name=Colorn2002/> and far from<ref name=Ferguson2000/> aquaculture operations have also proven susceptible to ''S.&nbsp;iniae'' infection.

The site of ''S.&nbsp;iniae'' infection and its clinical presentation vary from species to species. In tilapia, ''S.&nbsp;iniae'' causes meningoencephalitis, with symptoms including [[lethargy]], dorsal rigidity, and erratic swimming behavior; death follows in a matter of days.<ref name=Weinstein1997/><ref name=Low/><ref name=Austin/> In rainbow trout, it is typically associated with [[septicemia]] and central nervous system damage. Symptoms are consistent with septicemia, and include lethargy and loss of orientation (as in tilapia), [[exophthalmos|exophthalmia]], corneal opacity, and external and internal bleeding.<ref name=Lahav/><ref name=Austin/>

===In humans===
{{see also|Cutaneous Streptococcus iniae infection}}
[[File:Tsukiji fish market thuna knife.jpg|thumb|right|Most human ''S.&nbsp;iniae'' infections are associated with injuries while handling live or fresh infected fish.]]
''Streptococcus iniae'' can cause [[opportunistic infection]]s in weakened or [[immunocompromised]] humans.<ref name=Agnew/> It is most commonly associated with [[bacteremia|bacteremic]] [[cellulitis]], but has been known to cause [[endocarditis]], [[meningitis]], [[osteomyelitis]], and [[septic arthritis]].<ref name=Lau2003/> The first recognized cases of human infection occurred in [[Texas]] in 1991 and in [[Ottawa]] in 1994, but the sources of infection were not determined.<ref name="urlCDC"/> Human infection with ''S.&nbsp;iniae'' was also identified in [[Toronto]] between 15 and 20 December 1995, when three Asian patients were admitted to a hospital with cellulitis of the hand after injuring themselves while handling raw fish. All three were found to have bacteremia, initially attributed to ''[[Streptococcus uberis]]'', but later correctly identified as ''S.&nbsp;iniae''.<ref name=Weinstein1997/><ref name=Low/> In February 1996, a Chinese man was admitted to the same hospital with [[sepsis]] one week after preparing a fresh whole tilapia, and was also diagnosed with ''S.&nbsp;iniae'' bacteremia.<ref name=Weinstein1997/><ref name=Low/> A subsequent epidemiological investigation found other cases in the Toronto area, for a total of nine patients; all were of Asian descent and all had handled raw fish (mostly tilapia) before developing infection.<ref name=Weinstein1997/> Other cases were later identified in the [[United States]] and elsewhere in [[Canada]], and have since been reported in Asia ([[Hong Kong]], [[Taiwan]], and [[Singapore]]).<ref name=Lau2003/><ref name=Sun/><ref name=Koh2004/> Asian descent is a common trend in the majority of invasive human cases, but it is unknown whether this is due to inherent differences in immunity or because of cultural differences in the fish preparation which lend themselves to a higher incidence of infection.<ref name=Agnew/>

===Control and treatment===

Several measures can be taken to control infection in aquaculture once a ''S.&nbsp;iniae'' outbreak has been confirmed. Decreasing the quantity of feed given to fish has been shown to reduce [[mortality rate]]s, as the uptake of bacteria in water is expedited by feeding. Decreasing the density of the [[fish stock]] increases survival by reducing injury to fish and lowering the general stress level in the population. Lowering the water temperature and keeping optimal oxygen levels has also been shown to reduce stress to fish and inhibit bacterial growth.<ref name=Shoemaker2000/>

A 2005 study showed the potential for using [[probiotic]]s for controlling ''S.&nbsp;iniae'' infection in trout.<ref name=Brunt2005/> This study used the gastrointestinal contents of [[rainbow trout]] to scan for bacteria that inhibited growth of ''S.&nbsp;iniae'' and ''[[Lactococcus garvieae]]''. They identified ''[[Aeromonas sobria]]'' as a potential candidate for control of ''S.&nbsp;iniae'' and ''L.&nbsp;garvieae'' infections in aquaculture. ''A.&nbsp;sobria'', given live in the feed, protected the trout when challenged with ''S.&nbsp;iniae'' or ''L.&nbsp;garvieae''.<ref name=Brunt2005/>

Several antibiotics have been used successfully to treat ''S.&nbsp;iniae'' infection in fish. [[Enrofloxacin]], a [[quinolone]] antibiotic, has been used to great effect in [[hybrid striped bass]] (''Morone chrysops''&nbsp;<U+00D7> ''M.&nbsp;saxatilis''), although evidence suggested the development of a resistant strain.<ref name=Stoffregen/> [[Amoxicillin]], [[erythromycin]], [[furazolidone]], and [[oxytetracycline]] have also been used (the last with varying success, only in barramundi).<ref name=Agnew/> [[Vaccination]] against ''S.&nbsp;iniae'' has been attempted with limited success as it only provides up to 6 months' immunity.<ref name=Agnew/><ref name="WikiVet"/> 

[[Penicillin]] has been suggested as the drug of choice for the treatment of ''S.&nbsp;iniae'' infection in mammals, including humans.<ref name=Facklam2005/><ref name=Lau2003/><ref name=Agnew/> In the 1995<U+2013>1996 cluster of human cases, all clinical [[wikt:isolate|isolate]]s were susceptible to penicillin, several [[cephalosporin]]s, [[clindamycin]], erythromycin, and [[co-trimoxazole]] ([[minimum inhibitory concentration|MIC]]s 0.25&nbsp;[[microgram|<U+00B5>g]]/mL); all nine patients were treated with [[route of administration#Parenteral|parenteral]] beta-lactam antibiotics and recovered uneventfully.<ref name=Weinstein1997/><ref name=Low/> A study of isolates submitted to the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] between 2000 and 2004 found all to be sensitive to beta-lactams, [[macrolide]]s, [[quinolone]]s, and [[vancomycin]].<ref name=Facklam2005/>
