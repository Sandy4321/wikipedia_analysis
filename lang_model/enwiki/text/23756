'''''Moonraker''''' ([[1979 in film|1979]]) is the eleventh [[spy film]] in the [[James Bond]] [[James Bond (film series)|series]], and the fourth to star [[Roger Moore]] as the [[fictional character|fictional]] [[Secret Intelligence Service|MI6]] agent [[James Bond (character)|James Bond]]. In the film, Bond is sent to investigate the mysterious theft of a space shuttle, leading him to [[Hugo Drax]], [[billionaire]] owner of the shuttle-manufacturing firm. Along with space scientist [[Holly Goodhead]], who later is identified as a [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] agent also investigating Drax, Bond follows the trail of clues from California to [[Venice]], Italy, [[Rio de Janeiro]], [[Brazil]] and the [[Amazon rain forest]], and finally into outer space in a bid to prevent a genocidal plot to wipe out the world and re-create human existence with a [[master race]].

''Moonraker'' was intended by its creator [[Ian Fleming]] to be turned into a film even before he completed the [[Moonraker (novel)|novel]] in 1954, as he based the novel on a manuscript he had written even earlier than this. The producers of the James Bond film series had originally intended to release ''Moonraker'' in 1969 with Roger Moore making his debut as Bond, but the film was put on hold and finally released in 1979 to co-incide with the [[science fiction]] genre which had become extremely popular during this period with films such as ''[[Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope|Star Wars]]'' (1977). 

[[Derek Meddings]], a long-time contributor to the James Bond series, received an [[Academy Award for Best Visual Effects]] nomination for the special effects used in the film and its space scenes.

==Plot==
A Drax Industries Moonraker space shuttle is hijacked in mid-air, causing the incineration of the carrier [[Boeing 747]]. Bond is recalled from South Africa to investigate. En route in a small jet, Bond is attacked by the pilot and crew, and on overpowering two of the crew, is pushed out of the plane by henchman Jaws. He survives by stealing a parachute from the pilot in mid-air, whilst Jaws lands conveniently on a [[circus tent]]. Bond reports to [[MI6]] headquarters in London, and is briefed by M and Q about the hijacking. It is agreed that the investigation should begin at the Drax Industries shuttle complex in southern [[California]].

At Drax Industries, Bond is coldly greeted by the owner of the company [[Hugo Drax]] and henchman Chang at his chateau. Bond later meets an astronaut at the complex, Dr. [[Holly Goodhead]], and is placed in a centrifuge chamber to experience enchanced gravitational force. However, the controls are taken over by Chang whilst Goodhead is absent and he makes an early attempt to kill Bond by over-running it over double the recommended limit of 7Gs. Surviving, but unsteady from the experience, Bond is later inadvertently aided by Drax's personal pilot, [[Corinne Dufour]], as he sneaks into Drax's study and finds blueprints for a glass vial made in [[Venice]] by a company called ''Venini Glass''. The next morning, during a shooting session in the grounds of Drax's chateau, Dufour is fired by Drax and then killed by two Dobermans, a death which is symbolised by the church bells in Venice as the film then moves on there.
[[Image:HugoDrax79.jpg|thumb|left|Billionaire Hugo Drax at his shuttle launching complex.]]
Bond arrives at a glass museum in Venice and he again encounters Goodhead. Later, he is chased through the canals by Drax's henchmen but his [[gondola]], with the ability to transform into a hovercraft, allows him to escape across the [[Piazza San Marco]] in a comic fashion. That night, Bond returns to the glass factory and breaks into a high-tech laboratory whereby on accidentally poisoning the scientists there, he learns that the vials are to hold a [[nerve gas]] fatal only to humans. After leaving, Chang, in [[Kendo]] gear, ambushes Bond in the glass museum, resulting the smashing of a high number of vases and whole cases of items on display and ending in Chang's death in the attic by falling through the glass clock window onto the piano in the square. During the fight, Bond's sees a number of crates suggesting that Drax is moving his operation to [[Rio de Janeiro]]. Bond sneaks into Goodhead's hotel room, where he notices a flame-throwing perfume bottle, poisoned darts and a radio transmitter issued by the [[Central Intelligence Agency]]. He concludes that Goodhead is a CIA agent spying on Drax. They promise to work together, but quickly dispense with the truce. Bond has saved one of the vials he found earlier, as the only evidence of the now empty laboratory, giving it to M for analysis, who permits him to go to Rio de Janeiro.

In Rio de Janeiro Bond is followed by his Brazilian contact [[List of James Bond allies in Moonraker#Manuela|Manuela]], who he soon sleeps with. He learns that Chang has been replaced by Jaws. Bond meets with Goodhead at the top of the [[Sugarloaf Mountain, Brazil|Sugar Loaf]], but while on the cable car are attacked by Jaws, who has a fellow henchmen running the cars in the command centre. After Jaws' cable car crashes into the control centre at top speed, he is rescued by a short girl ("Dolly") from the rubble, and the two fall in love. Bond and Goodhead lying on the ground after the cable car event are captured by henchmen and sent off tied down in an [[ambulance]]. Bond however escapes.

Bond, dressed in [[gaucho]] garb, reports to M's headquarters in Brazil and learns that the toxin comes from a rare [[orchid]] indigenous to the upper catchments of the [[Amazon jungle]]. While deadly to humans, it is harmless to all other life. Bond then travels up the [[Amazon River]] looking for Drax's research facility, and soon encounters Jaws and other henchmen again in a speedboat chase. Bond escapes via a hang glider from the speedboat just as it passes into the [[Iguacu Falls]]. Bond lands in a forest and is intoxicatingly lured into an ancient [[Maya]]n pyramid by a group of beautiful women.  An attempt to kill him by him falling into the centre pool with a snake however is unsuccessful, as he kills the python. Captured by Jaws again, Bond is taken to Drax's adjacent control room, where he sees four Moonrakers lifting off. Drax confirms Bond's theory that he himself stole the Moonraker because another in the fleet had developed a fault during assembly. Bond is reunited with Goodhead in a blast pit underneath Drax's personal shuttle set for lift off. He and Goodhead however, escape, and successfully pose as pilots on the sixth shuttle. All shuttles then dock with Drax's space station, which is invisible from Earth.

[[Image:Moonraker zero g.jpg|thumb|right|The climax of the film with the laser battle on Drax's space station. Moonraker holds the world record for the largest number of zero gravity wires in one scene.]]

Drax plans to destroy all human life by launching 50 globes containing the toxin into the earth's atmosphere. Before launching the globes, Drax also transported several dozen young men and women (many of which Bond had encountered in the pyramid) of varying race which he regarded as genetically perfect to the space station. They would live there until Earth was safe again for human life; their descendents will be the seed for a "new master race." Bond makes a [[bible|bibical]] reference to [[Noah's Ark]] in the manner in which Drax ordered them into the shuttles "two by two" in the process of eliminating human life and starting again. Bond persuades Jaws and Dolly to switch allegiance by getting Drax to admit that anyone not measuring up to his physical standards would be exterminated (Dolly's glasses and Jaws' metal teeth being traits that exclude them both).

Learning that a [[Radar jamming and deception|radar-jammer]] is responsible for hiding the space station's orbital presence from observers on Earth, 007 and Goodhead disable it. The U.S. send a platoon of [[United States Marine Corps|Marines]] in a military shuttle. On arrival, a laser battle ensues. During the battle, Bond shoots Drax with a cyanide-coated dart attached to his watch, pushes him to an airlock, and ejects him into outer space.

Before the battle, Drax launched three of the globes towards Earth. Victorious, the Americans leave when Bond says their mission is completed. The space station is heavily damaged and begins to fall apart. Jaws helps Bond and Goodhead escape in Drax's space shuttle. In celebration, Jaws opens a champagne bottle and he and Dolly toast (in his only spoken line: "Well, here's to us!"). They too escape the space station as their module breaks away before the station explodes. Goodhead and Bond track the three poison gas globes, and Bond uses Drax's shuttle lasers to destroy them. The two return to Earth after making love in space (prompting the memorable line from Q: "I think he's attempting re-entry Sir!").

==Production==
The end credits for the previous Bond film, ''[[The Spy Who Loved Me (film)|The Spy Who Loved Me]]'', said, "James Bond will return in ''[[For Your Eyes Only (film)|For Your Eyes Only]]''"; however, the producers chose ''[[Moonraker (novel)|Moonraker]]'' as the basis for the next film,<ref name="Inside Moonraker"/> following the box office success of the 1977 space-themed film ''[[Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope]]''. ''For Your Eyes Only'' was subsequently delayed and ended up following ''Moonraker'' in 1981.<ref>{{cite video|date=2000|title= For Your Eyes Only Special Edition, Region 2|date=1981|format=DVD|publisher=[[MGM]]}} </ref>

===Script===
[[Ian Fleming]] had originally intended the [[Moonraker (novel)|novel]], published in 1954, to be made into a film even before he began writing it and was based on an original manuscript of a screenplay which had been on his mind for years.<ref name="DVD booklet">{{cite book|title =Moonraker Special Edition, Region 2 booklet|date=2000|accessdate = October 3|accessyear=2008}}</ref> In 1955, the film rights to ''Moonraker'' were initially sold to John Payne of the [[Rank Organisation]] for <U+00A3>10,000 (<U+00A3>{{nts|{{inflation|UK|10000|1955|{{CURRENTYEAR}}}}}} present value), paying a $1000 a month option for nine months. Payne was the first person interested in making the novels into a film series, but later rejected the idea based on the fact it wouldn't be possible for him to obtain the rights to the entire 007 series. In spring 1959, due to on-going difficulties, Fleming eventually bought back the rights for his novels, shortly before selling them to [[Harry Saltzman]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mi6.co.uk/sections/articles/biography_harry_saltzman.php3|title=Biography - Harry Saltzman
|date=February 18 2005|publisher=Mi6.co.uk|accessdate = November 11|accessyear=2008}}</ref>

However, as with several previous Bond films, the story from Fleming's novel is almost entirely dispensed with, and little more than the name of Hugo Drax was used in film, in favour of a film more in keeping with the era of [[science fiction]]. The 2002 Bond film ''[[Die Another Day]]'' makes further use of some ideas and character names from the novel. [[Tom Mankiewicz]] had written a full screenplay of ''Moonraker'' that was eventually partly discarded. According to Mankiewicz footage shot at Drax's lairs was considerably more detailed than the edited result in the final version. The crew had shot a scene with Drax meeting his co-financiers in his jungle lair and they used the same chamber room below the space shuttle launch pad that Bond and Goodhead eventually escape from. This scene was shot but later cut out.<ref name="MI6"> {{cite web|url=http://www.mi6.co.uk/sections/movies/mr.php3|title=Moonraker:Cut Scenes & Alternate Versions|publisher=Mi6.co.uk|accessdate=October 3|accessyear=2008}}</ref> Another scene involving Bond and Goodhead in a meditation room aboard Drax's space station, was shot but never used in the final film. However, press stills were released of the scene which featured on Topps trading cards in 1979 as was a theatrical trailer which featured Bond punching Jaws in the face aboard the space station, neither of which featured in the complete film.<ref name="MI6"/> Some scenes from Mankiewicz's script were later used in subsequent films, including the Acrostar Jet sequence used in the pre-credit sequence for ''[[Octopussy]]'', and the [[Eiffel Tower]] scene in ''[[A View to a Kill]]''.

In March 2004, an [[Internet hoax]] stated rumours about a lost 1956 version of ''Moonraker'' by [[Orson Welles]], and  a James Bond web site repeated it on [[April Fool's Day]] in 2004 as a hoax. Supposedly, this recently discovered lost film was 40 minutes of raw footage with [[Dirk Bogarde]] as Bond, Welles as Drax, and [[Peter Lorre]] as Drax's henchman.<ref>{{cite web|title=Moonraker: The "Forgotten" 1956 Film Version?|url=http://www.commanderbond.net/Public/Stories/2323-1.shtml|date=April 7 2004|publisher=Commanderbond.net|accessdate=October 3|accessyear=2008}}</ref> A film poster was created displaying the actors and the title of the film.

====Novelisation====
[[Image:MoonrakerMovieNovel.jpg|thumb|right|200px|1979 Triad/Panther British paperback edition; artwork by Dan Gouzee.]]
The screenplay of ''Moonraker'' differed so much from Ian Fleming's novel that [[EON Productions]] and [[Glidrose Publications]] authorised the film's [[screenwriter]], [[Christopher Wood (writer)|Christopher Wood]] to write his second [[novelization|novelisation]] based upon the film. It was named ''James Bond and Moonraker '' to avoid confusion with Fleming's original novel ''[[Moonraker (novel)|Moonraker]]''. It was released in [[1979 in literature|1979]], in the aftermath of the films release.<ref name="Wood"> {{cite web|url=http://www.mi6.co.uk/sections/articles/interview_christopher_wood.php3|title=Christopher Wood Interview|date=February 6 2005|publisher=Mi6.co.uk|accessdate=November 11|accessyear=2008}}</ref> Unlike Wood's first novelisation, ''James Bond, The Spy Who Loved Me'' ([[1977 in literature|1977]]), which showed a significant difference to the actual film, in ''James Bond and Moonraker'', Wood writes a virtually direct novelisation of the screenplay.<ref name="Wood"/> The only noticeable differences between the novelisation and the screenplay for ''Moonraker'' is that there is no mention of Dolly, Jaws' girlfriend, and his characterisation stays true to Wood's description as being a [[Speech disorder|mute]]. In addition, at the conclusion of the Venetian canal chase sequence, Bond's gondola does not sprout a flotation device and ascend to St. Mark's square as it does in the film. 

After the release of the novel, Glidrose Productions chose not to commission novelisations of the next few Bond films; the next film to be novelised would be ''[[Licence to Kill]]'' ten years later in 1989, owing to it not having been based on an original Fleming novel.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mi6.co.uk/sections/movies/ltk_trivia.php3?t=ltk&s=ltk|title=Trivia - Licence To Kill|publisher=Mi6.co.uk|accessdate=November 11|accessyear=2008}}</ref>

===Casting===
The role of the villain, Hugo Drax, was originally offered to [[James Mason]].<ref name="MI6other"> {{cite web|url=http://www.mi6.co.uk/sections/movies/mr.php3|title=Moonraker:Trivia|publisher=Mi6.co.uk|accessdate=October 3|accessyear=2008}}</ref> However well-established French actor [[Michael Lonsdale]] was cast as the billionaire Drax, partly due to his fluency in English, and [[Corinne Clery]] for the part of [[Corinne Dufour]], given that the film was produced in France. American actress [[Lois Chiles]] had originally been offered the role of [[Anya Amasova]] in ''[[The Spy Who Loved Me (film)|The Spy Who Loved Me]]'' (1977), but had turned down the part when she decided to take temporary retirement. Chiles was cast as Holly Goodhead by chance, when she was given the seat next to [[Lewis Gilbert]] on a flight and he believed she would be ideal for the role as the CIA scientist. <ref name="Inside Moonraker"> {{cite video|title=Inside Moonraker|format=DVD|publisher=[[MGM]]}}</ref>
Drax's henchman Chang, played by Japanese [[aikido]] instructor [[Toshiro Suga]], was recommended for the role by executive producer [[Michael G. Wilson]], who was one of his pupils.<ref name="Inside Moonraker"/>  In ''Moonraker'', Wilson also continued a tradition in the Bond films he started in the film ''[[Goldfinger (film)|Goldfinger]]'' where he has a small cameo role. He appears twice in the film, first as a tourist outside the Venini Glass shop and museum in Venice, then at the end of the film as a technician in Drax's control room.
[[Image:JawsandDolly.jpg|thumb|left|The height difference between the giant Jaws and his diminuative girlfriend Dolly.]]
The Jaws character, played by [[Richard Kiel]] makes a return, although in ''Moonraker'' the role is played more for comedic effect than in ''The Spy Who Loved Me''. Jaws was intended to be a villain against Bond to the bitter end, but director Lewis Gilbert stated on the DVD documentary that he received so much fan mail from small children saying "Why can't Jaws be a goodie not a baddie", that as a result he was persuaded to make Jaws gradually become Bond's ally at the end of the film.<ref name="Inside Moonraker"/> 

Diminuative French actress [[Blanche Ravalec]], who had recently begun her career with minor roles in French films such as [[Michel Lang]]'s ''[[Holiday Hotel]]'' (1978) and [[Claude Sautet]]'s [[Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film]] nominee, ''[[A Simple Story (1978 film)|A Simple Story]]'' (1978), was cast as the bespectacled Dolly, the girlfriend of Jaws. Originally, the producers were dubious about whether the audience would accept the height difference between them, and only made their decision once they were informed by Richard Kiel that his real-life wife was of the same height.<ref name="MI6other"/>[[Lois Maxwell]]'s 22 year old daughter, Melinda Maxwell, was also cast as one of the "perfect" human specimens from Drax's master race.<ref name="DVD booklet"/>

===Filming and effects===
Production began on August 14, 1978. Main shooting was switched from the usual 007 Stage at [[Pinewood Studios]] to France, due to high taxation in England at the time. Only the cable car interiors and space battle exteriors were filmed at Pinewood. The massive sets of Moonraker designed by [[Ken Adam]] were the largest ever constructed in France and required more than 222,000 man-hours to construct (roughly 1000 hours by each of the crew on average).<ref name="Inside Moonraker"/> They were shot at three of France's largest film studios in [[Boulogne]], [[Epinay]] and [[Billancourt]].<ref name="DVD booklet"/> 
220 technicians used 100 tonnes of metal, two tonnes of nails and 10,000 feet of wood to build the three-story space station set at Eponay Studios.<ref name="DVD booklet"/> The elaborate space set for Moonraker holds the world record for having the largest number of zero gravity wires in one scene.<ref name="Inside Moonraker"/> The Venecian glass museum and fight between Bond and Chang was shot at Boulogne Studios in a building which had once been a [[World War II]] [[Luftwaffe]] aircraft factory during [[German occupation of France|Germany's occupation of France]].<ref name="DVD booklet"/> The scene in the Venice glass museum and warehouse holds the record for the largest amount of break-away sugar glass used in a single scene.<ref name="Inside Moonraker"/>
[[Image:Vaux-le-Vicomte Panorama.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Vaux-le-Vicomte|Ch<U+00E2>teau de Vaux-le-Vicomte]] was used for Drax's chateau in the film. An extensive aerial view of the site was witnessed by helicopter in the early stages of the film by Bond and Dufour arriving.]]
Drax's mansion, set in California, was actually filmed at the [[Vaux-le-Vicomte|Ch<U+00E2>teau de Vaux-le-Vicomte]], about {{convert|55|km|mi}} southeast of Paris, France for the exteriors and Grand Salon. The remaining interiors, including some of the scenes with Corinne Defour and the drawing room, were filmed at the [[Ch<U+00E2>teau de Guermantes]].<ref name="Inside Moonraker"/> 

Much of the film was shot in the cities of London, [[Paris, France|Paris]], [[Venice]], [[Palmdale, California|Palmdale]] and [[Rio de Janeiro]]. The production team had considered India and [[Nepal]] as a location in the film but on arriving there to investigate they found it inconceivable to write it into the script, particularly with time restrictions to do so.<ref name="Inside Moonraker"/> They decided on Rio de Janeiro relatively early on, which Cubby Broccoli had visited on vacation, and a team was sent to the city in early 1978 to capture initial footage from the [[Mardi Gras]] festival which featured in the film.<ref name="Inside Moonraker"/> 
[[Image:Rio de Janeiro - P<U+00E3>o de A<U+00E7>ucar - Cablecar.jpg|thumb|left|Stuntman Richard Graydon slipped and narrowly avoided falling to his death during the filming of the cable car sequence at [[Sugarloaf Mountain, Brazil|Sugarloaf Mountain]].]]

At the Rio de Janeiro location, many months later, Roger Moore arrived several days later than scheduled for shooting due to recurrent health problems and an attack of [[kidney stones]] he received in France.<ref name="Inside Moonraker"/> After arriving in Rio, he was immediately whisked off the plane and went straight to hair and makeup, before reboarding the plane, to film the sequence with him arriving as James Bond in the film. [[Sugarloaf Mountain, Brazil|Sugarloaf Mountain]] was a prominent location in the film, and during filming of the cable car sequence in which Bond and Goodhead are attacked by Jaws during mid-air transportation high above Rio, stuntman Richard Graydon slipped and narrowly avoided falling to his death.<ref name="Inside Moonraker"/> The scene in which Jaws bites into the steel tramway cable with his teeth was actually made of [[liquorice]], although he was still required to use his steel dentures.<ref name="DVD booklet"/> 

[[Iguazu Falls]] was a natural location depicted in the film, although as stated by Q in the film, the falls were intended to be located somewhere in the upper catchment of the Amazon rather than where the falls are actually located in the south. The second unit had originally planned on sending an actual boat over the falls.<ref name="Inside Moonraker"/> However on attempting to release it, the boat became firmly embedded on rocks near the edge. Despite a dangerous attempt by helicopter and ropeladder to retrieve it, the plan had to be abandoned, forcing the second unit to use a minitature at Pinewood instead.<ref name="Inside Moonraker"/> The exterior of Drax's pyramid headquarters in the Amazon rainforest near the falls was actually filmed at the [[Tikal]] [[Mayan]] ruins in [[Guatemala]].<ref name="DVD booklet"/> The interior of the pyramid, however, was designed by Ken Adam at Pinewood studio in which he purposefully used a shiny coating to make the walls look plastic and false.<ref name="Inside Moonraker"/> All of the space centre scenes were shot at the Vehicle Assembly Building of [[Kennedy Space Center]], [[Florida]] although some of the earlier scenes of the Moonraker assembly plant were filmed on location at the Rockwell International manufacturing facilities in Palmdale, California.
[[Image:Jaws79skydive.jpg|thumb|right|[[Richard Kiel]] as Jaws, pushing Bond out of the plane without a parachute. The sequence, ending with Jaws falling onto a circus tent took 88 skydives to complete footage.]]
The early scene involving Bond and Jaws in which Bond is pushed out of the aircraft without a [[parachute]] took weeks of planning and preparation. The skydiving sequence was coordinated by Don Calvedt under the supervision of second unit coordinator [[John Glen]].<ref name="Inside Moonraker"/> Stuntman [[Jake Lombard]] was hired to double for Bond, who would later pose as Moore's double in films such as ''[[Octopussy]]'' and for [[List of James Bond henchmen in The Living Daylights#Necros|Necros]] in ''[[The Living Daylights]]''. [[B. J. Worth]], who played the stunt double of Jaws, would also later become a consistent member of the stunt team for aerial sequences throughout the 1980s, into [[Timothy Dalton]]'s films such as ''[[The Living Daylights]]''.<ref name="Inside Moonraker"/> Members of the U.S. championship skydiving team aided the stunt team with the planning and the team's master rigger designed a one-inch thick parachute pack that could be concealed beneath the suit to give the impression of the missing parachute.<ref name="Inside Moonraker"/>
When the stunt men opened their parachutes at the end of every shoot, custom-sewn [[velcro]] costume seams would separate to allow the hidden parachutes to open.<ref name="DVD booklet"/> The skydiver cinematographer used a lightweight [[Panavision]] camera, bought from an old pawn shop in Paris, which he attached to his helmet to shoot the entire sequence.<ref name="Inside Moonraker"/> The scene took a total of 88 skydives by the stuntmen to complete it.<ref name="Inside Moonraker"/>

For the scene involving the opening of the musical electronic laboratory doorlock in Venice, producer Albert R. Broccoli requested special permission from director [[Steven Spielberg]] to use the five-note leitmotif from his film ''[[Close Encounters of the Third Kind]]'' (1977). In 1985, Broccoli would return the favor by fulfilling Spielberg's request to use the James Bond theme music for a scene in his film, ''[[The Goonies]]'' (1985).

===Music===
{{main|Moonraker (soundtrack)}}
The soundtrack of ''Moonraker'' was composed by [[John Barry (composer)|John Barry]] and recorded in Paris, again, as with production, marking a turning point away from the English location at CTS Studios in London. The score also marked a turning point in John Barry's output, abandoning the Kentonesque brass of his earlier Bond scores and instead scoring the film with slow, rich string passages - a trend which Barry would continue in the 1980s with scores such as ''[[Out of Africa (film)|Out of Africa]]'' and ''[[Somewhere in Time (film)|Somewhere in Time]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.filmtracks.com/titles/dances_wolves.html|title=Dances With Wolves|publisher=Filmtracks.com|accessdate=November 11|accessyear=2008}}</ref>  
For ''Moonraker'', Barry uses for the first time since ''[[Diamonds Are Forever (film)|Diamonds Are Forever]]'' (1971) a piece of music called "007" (on track 7), the secondary Bond theme composed by Barry which was introduced in ''[[From Russia with Love (film)|From Russia with Love]]'' over the end credits. Barry made notable use of [[classical music]] passages in the film.

''Moonraker'' was the third of the three Bond films for which the theme song was performed by [[Shirley Bassey]]. [[Kate Bush]] and [[Frank Sinatra]] were both considered for the vocals, before [[Johnny Mathis]] was approached and offered the opportunity. However for some reason, Mathis, despite having started recording with Barry, was unable to complete the project, leaving producers to offer the song to Bassey within just weeks of the release date.<ref name="Bassey"> {{cite web|url=http://www.bassey.co.uk/blog/shirley_bassey/2006_03_12_peggyblog.html|title=The Filming of Another Audience With Shirley Bassey|publisher=Bassey.co.uk|accessdate=November 11|accessyear=2008}}</ref> As a result Bassey made the recordings with very short notice and as a result, she never regarded the song 'as her own' as she had never had the chance to perform it or promote it first.<ref name="Bassey"/> The film uses two versions of the title theme song, a ballad version heard over the main titles, and a disco version. Confusingly, the [[United Artists]] single release labelled the tracks on the 7" single as "Moonraker (Main Title)" for the version used to close the film and "Moonraker (End Title)" for the track that opened the film.<ref name="DVD film"/> The song failed to make an impact on the charts, reaching only 159, partly attributed to Bassey's failure to promote the single, given the last-minute decision to quickly record it to meet the schedule.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.songsofshirleybassey.co.uk/song/sng79009.html|title=Moonraker:Music written by John Barry and lyrics by Hal David|publisher=Songs of Shirley Bassey|accessdate=November 11|accessyear=2008}}</ref>

Finally in 2005, Bassey sang the song for the first time outside James Bond on stage as part of a medley of her three Bond title songs.<ref name="Bassey"/> An instrumental strings version of the title theme was used in 2007 tourism commercials for the [[Dominican Republic]].

===DVD release===
Moonraker was released with a Dolby Digital 5.1 mix on the MGM Special Edition in 2000, but it was re-released in 2003 as an Ultimate Edition with enchanced footage. The 42 minute documentary ''Inside Moonraker'' on the special effects and stuntwork was carried over from the original release, as was the 18 minute ''The Men Behind the Mayhem'' featuring director [[Lewis Gilbert]], executive and associate producers Michael G. Wilson and [[William P. Cartlidge]] and writer [[Christopher Wood]], relating memories of the production. The Ultimate Edition comes with several commentaries, one which features Roger Moore, which had been recently recorded for the release. <ref name="ULT"> {{cite web|url=http://www.dvdtimes.co.uk/content.php?contentid=62208|title=Moonraker (Ulimate DVD Edition)|publisher=DVD Times|date=2006|accessdate=October 3|accessyear=2008}}</ref>

The second disc of the Ultimate Edition DVD opens with at an 11 minute footage of set designer Ken Adam's productions, including home interviews with him and an exploration of Eon Productions locations and sets. <ref name="ULT"/> Other features include Michael G. Wilson introducing interviews with the members of the cast and crew and an archive 12 minute feature, ''007 in Rio'', which covers the production team in Rio de Janeiro but takes a more general analysis of behind the scenes in the overall film. <ref name="ULT"/>There is also brief storyboard coverage including four short storyboard sequences and test footage, which includes coverage of the [[circus]] landing, the cable car scene and the skydiving scene.

==Reception==
[[Derek Meddings]], a long contributor to the James Bond series, received an [[Academy Award for Best Visual Effects]] nomination for the special effects used in the film and the space scenes. However, although the film was widely praised for its special effects and advancement in technology and production sets, the film is often considered by critics and an element of James Bond fans as one of the lesser films in the James Bond series, largely due to the extent of the plot which takes James Bond into space and some of ploys used in the film for comedic effect. Reviews have generally been balanced between criticising the far-fetched nature of the plot, and comments that have reflected that they enjoyed the film for this very reason. Nick Hilditch of the [[BBC]] sums up a common critical response to the film; "For many ''Moonraker'' is the worst Bond film, not least because the adventure culminates in a massive laser battle above the planet. Besides this farther-than-far-fetched effort to capitalise on the late '70s taste for [[science fiction]], such inanities as Bond driving round St Mark's Square in a gondola-turned-hovercraft don't help much either. Frivolous, yes, but never dull." <ref>{{cite web|author=Hilditch, Nick|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/films/2001/07/27/moonraker_1979_review.shtml|title=Moonraker (1979)|date=July 27 2001|publisher=[[BBC]]|accessdate=October 5|accessyear=2007}}</ref> Other critics continued to illustrate their disapproval for the attempts at comedy in film, with some critics mocking Jaw's "flapping his wings" and circus landing site during the skydive sequence and others describing the comedic aspects of the film as [[cheesy]]. Critic Nicholas Sylvain said of the film "''Moonraker'' seems to have more than its share of little flaws and annoyances which begin right from the opening pre-credit sequence. The sheer idiocy (and impossibility) of having a fully-fueled shuttle on the back of the Boeing during the trans-Atlantic crossing should be evident, and later in the film, the whole Jaws-falls-in-love and becomes a "good guy" routine leaves me rather cold, and provides far too much cheesy comedy moments, as does the gondola driving through the square scene. <ref>{{cite web|author=Sylvain, Nick|url= http://www.dvdverdict.com/reviews/bondmoon.php

[[Image:Moonrakergondola.jpg|thumb|right|The scene in which Moore drives an inflatable gondola around St Mark's Square in Venice was widely criticised by film critics.]]
In his review of ''Moonraker'' in 1979, ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' film critic [[Roger Ebert]] whilst clearly expressing his approval of the advanced special effects and Ken Adam's extravagant production sets, he criticised the pace in which the locations of the film evolved, remarking that "it's so jammed with faraway places and science fiction special effects that Bond has to move at a trot just to make it into all the scenes". <ref>{{cite web|author=[[Roger Ebert|Ebert, Roger]]|url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19790101/REVIEWS/41008002/1023|title=Moonraker|publisher=[[Chicago Sun-Times]]|accessdate=October 3|accessyear=2008}}</ref>[[Christopher Null]] of [[Filmcritic.com]] said of the film; "Most rational observers agree that ''Moonraker'' is without a doubt the most absurd James Bond movie, definitely of the Roger Moore era and possibly of all time". <ref name="Filmcritic"> {{cite web|author=[[Christopher Null|Null, Christopher]]|url=http://www.filmcritic.com/misc/emporium.nsf/84dbbfa4d710144986256c290016f76e/4417de46f8fb4c618825709a006bcd63?OpenDocument|title=Moonraker|date=2005|publisher=[[Filmcritic.com]]|accessdate=October 3|accessdate=2008}}</ref>
However whilst he criticised the extravagance of the plot and action sequences he believed that this added to the enjoyment of the film, and particularly approved of the remark "I think he's attempting re-entry!" by Q during Bond and Goodhead's orbiting of the earth which he described as "featuring what might be the best [[double entendre]] ever".  <ref name="Filmcritic"/> 

However, other reviews of ''Moonraker'' have expressed that the film is one of Moore's stronger films as James Bond. [[James Berardinelli]] of ''Reelviews.net'' for instance remarked that, "the solid special effects, well-executed action sequences, and a strict reliance upon the 'Bond Formula' keep this film among Moore's better entries."<ref name="Rotten"> {{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/1014217-moonraker/ |title=Moonraker (1979)|publisher=[[Rottentomatoes.com]]|accessdate=October 5|accessyear=2007}}</ref>  Despite criticism about the far-fetched nature of the plot, websites such as ''[[Rotten Tomatoes]]'' have awarded the film a 64% "fresh" rating. <ref name="Rotten"/>

Aside from being nominated for an Academy Award for Best Visual Effects, the film, given its unusual attention to the science fiction genre than the average James Bond film, received attention from the [[Academy of Science Fiction, Fantasy & Horror Films]] and was nominated for several [[Saturn Awards]] in 1980. The nominees were for Best Science Fiction Film, Best Special Effects, and Best Supporting Actor (Richard Kiel). The DVD of the film was later nominated in 2004 for the Golden Satellite Award Best Classic DVD Release. ''Moonraker'' won the Golden Screen Award in Germany in 1980.

The exaggerated nature of the plot and space station sequence has seen the film parodied on numerous occasions. Of note is the [[Austin Powers (film series)|Austin Powers]] [[spoof]] film ''[[The Spy Who Shagged Me]]'' (1999) which whilst a parody of other James Bond films, pays reference to Moonraker by [[Dr. Evil]]'s lair in space. The scene in which Drax is shot by the cyanide dart and ousted into space is parodied by Power's ejection of Dr. Evil into outer space in the same way.
