'''Charles Cyril "Charlie" Creath''' (December 30, 1890, [[Ironton, Missouri]] - October 23, 1951, [[Chicago]]) was an American [[jazz]] trumpeter, saxophonist, accordionist, and bandleader.

Creath played in [[traveling circus]]es and in theater bands in the decade of the 1900s, and moved back to [[St. Louis, Missouri]] around 1919. There he led bands playing on the [[Streckfus]] company's [[riverboat]]s traveling on the [[Mississippi River]] between [[New Orleans]] and St. Louis. His ensembles were so popular that he had several bands under his own name at one time in the 1920s. He co-led a group on the ''SS Capitol'' in 1927 with [[Fate Marable]]. Late in the 1920s he suffered from an extended illness, and primarily played saxophone and accordion instead of trumpet afterwards. He and Marable played together again from 1935 to 1938, and toward the end of the decade Creath opened a [[nightclub]] in Chicago. He worked in an airplane manufacturing plant during [[World War II]] and retired in 1945. His last years were plagued with illness.

Aside from his brother-in-law, [[Zutty Singleton]], members of Creath's bands included [[Ed Allen (musician)|Ed Allen]], [[Pops Foster]], [[Jerome Don Pasquall]], and [[Lonnie Johnson]]. He recorded as a leader for [[Okeh Records]] between 1924 and 1927.
