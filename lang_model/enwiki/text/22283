A '''sept''' is an English word for a division of a [[family]], especially a division of a [[Scottish clan|clan]]. The word might have its origin from [[Latin]] ''septum'' "enclosure, fold",<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/sept |title=sept |accessdate=2008-09-05 |work= |publisher=Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary |date=2008 }}</ref> or it can be an alteration of ''sect''.<ref>Webster's II Dictionary Editors ''et al.'' (ed.) (2005). ''[http://books.google.com/books?id=OL60E3r2yiYC Webster's II New College Dictionary]'', page 1031. Houghton Mifflin Reference Books ISBN 0618396012</ref>

The term is found in both [[Ireland]] and [[Scotland]].  It is sometimes used to translate the word ''sliocht'', meaning ''seed'', indicating the descendants of a person (i.e., ''Sliocht Brian Mac Diarmata'', the descendants of Brian Mac Dermot). 
==Related septs==

Sil was used within the context of a family or clan, all who bore the same surname, as a manner of distinguishing one group from another. For example: a family called [[Mac an Bhaird]] (Anglicized as Ward) might be divided into septs such as Sil Sean mac Brian, Sil Conchobhar Og, Sil Sen Conn, Sil Cu Connacht. All of these individual lines might further sub-divide into still more septs, which in turn sometimes led to a new surname, and/or the emergence of the family considered a clan in their own right. This type of sept was normal in [[Scotland]].

==Scottish clan septs==

In the context of Scottish clans, septs are families that followed another family's chief. These smaller septs would then make up, and be part of the chief's larger clan. In some cases, a sept would follow another chief if two families were linked through marriage. However, if a family lived on the land of a powerful laird, they would follow him whether they were related or not. [[Bond of manrent|Bonds of manrent]] were sometimes used to bind lesser chiefs and his followers to more powerful chiefs.

Today sept lists are used by clan societies to recruit new members. Such lists date back to the 19th century, when clan societies and [[tartan]] manufacturers attempted to capitalise on the enthusiasm and interest for all things Scottish. Lists were drawn up that linked as many [[surname]]s as possible to a particular clan. In this way people without a "clan name" could connect to a Scottish clan and thus feel "entitled" to its tartan. One modern member of the [[Lyon Court]] has described the attribution of some such names to particular clans as being based upon nothing but imagination, and in others cases upon a single recorded instance of a surname. Also, [[common surnames]], found throughout the [[British Isles]], were linked to particular clans. For example, the surname ''[[Miller (name)|Miller]]'' was made a sept of [[Clan Macfarlane]], and ''[[Taylor (surname)|Taylor]]'' of [[Clan Cameron]]. Also, [[patronymic]] forms of common [[personal names]] were also linked to particular clans.<ref name="Campbell">{{cite book|author=Campbell of Airds, Alastair|title=A History of Clan Campbell; Volume 1, From Origins To The Battle Of Flodden|publisher=Edinburgh University Press|location=Edinburgh|year=2000|pages=220<U+2013>221|isbn=1-902930-17-7}}</ref> This has led to the false impression that many surnames have one origin and are all related to one another, and that such surnames are historically connected to one particular clan.

==Irish septs==  

Historically, the term 'sept' was not used in Ireland until the nineteenth century, long after any notion of clanship had been eradicated.  The English word 'sept' is most accurate referring to a sub-group within a large clan; especially  when that group has taken up residence outside of their clan's original territory.  ([[O'Neill]], [[Clan Sweeney|MacSweeney]], and [[O'Connor]] are examples.)  Related Irish septs and clans often belong to larger groups, sometimes called tribes, such as the [[D<U+00E1>l gCais]], [[U<U+00ED> N<U+00E9>ill]], [[U<U+00ED> Fiachrach]], and [[Hy-Many|U<U+00ED> Maine]].   Recently, the late [[Edward MacLysaght]] suggested the English word 'sept' be used in place of the word 'clan' with regards to the historical social structure in Ireland, so as to differentiate it from the centralized Scottish clan system.  This would imply that Ireland possessed no formalised clan system, which is not wholly accurate.  [[Brehon Law]], the ancient legal system of Ireland clearly defined the clan system in pre-Norman Ireland, which collapsed after the [[Tudor re-conquest of Ireland|Tudor Conquest]].  The Gaels, when speaking of themselves, employed their term 'clan'.
