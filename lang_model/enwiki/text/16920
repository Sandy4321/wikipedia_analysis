'''Yamhad''' (also written '''Yamkhad''' or '''Jamhad''') was an ancient [[Levant]]ine kingdom centered at <U+1E24>alab (or <U+1E24>alba), modern day [[Aleppo]], [[Syria]].<ref>{{cite book|url=http://books.google.nl/books?id=5MYFOWRZ8Z4C&pg=PA26#v=onepage&q&f=false|title=The pre-Islamic Middle East|author=Martin Sicker|page=26|year=2000}}</ref> The kingdom was ruled by the [[Yamhad dynasty]] and the people were predominately [[Amorites]] with a substantial [[Hurrian]] population who settled in the kingdom, adding the influence of their culture. 

An important religious and trade center, Yamhad was powerful during the early [[Bronze Age]]. Its biggest rivals were [[Assyria#Amorite Period in Assyria.2C 1809.E2.80.931750 BC|Assyria]] to the East and [[Qatna]] to the south. Yamhad dominated northern, northwestern and eastern Syria and had influence over small kingdoms in Mesopotamia at the borders of [[Elam]]. It was eventually destroyed by the [[Hittites]], then annexed by [[Mitanni]] in the 16th century&nbsp;BC.

Little of Halab has been excavated by archaeologists as Halab was never abandoned during its long history and the modern city is situated above the ancient site.<ref>{{cite book|url=http://books.google.nl/books?id=YqNvQgAACAAJ&dq|title=History of Ancient Levant (part 1) Syria|author= Ahmad Arhim Hebbo|page=30|year=1993}}</ref> Therefore, most of the knowledge about Yamhad comes from tablets discovered at [[Alalakh]] and [[Mari, Syria|Mari]].

===Rivalry with Assyria and Expansion===
The rise of [[Shamshi-Adad I]] of Assyria proved more dangerous to Yamhad than Mari, the Assyrian king was an ambitious conqueror with the aim to rule [[Mesopotamia]] and the Levant calling himself king of the World.<ref>{{cite book|url=http://books.google.nl/books?id=0H0EpSm8aioC&pg=PA9#v=onepage&q&f=false|title= Cultures in Contact: From Mesopotamia to the Mediterranean in the Second Millennium BC|author= Joan Aruz, Sarah B.

Sumu-Epuh welcomed Zimri-Limand aimed to use him against Assyria since he was the legitimate heir of Mari.<ref>{{cite book|url=http://books.google.nl/books?id=4DVHJRFW3mYC&pg=PT68#v=onepage&q&f=false|title= The Oxford History of the Biblical World|author= Michael David Coogan| page=68|year= 2001}}</ref>

===Decline and End===

[[Yarim-Lim III]] imposed Yamhad hegemony over Qatna, but the fortunes of Yamhad started to faint with the [[Hittites]] kingdom rising in the north. The weakening was obvious as Alalakh had became virtually independent under [[Ammitakum]] who declared himself king but not independent.<ref>{{cite book|url=http://books.google.nl/books?id=7TcJAQAAIAAJ&q=ammitakum&dq=ammitakum&hl=en&sa=X&ei=zzvhUqCkM8OqhQfwsIGoCw&ved=0CDcQ6AEwAjgK|title= Archaeology and Old Testament study: jubilee volume of the Society for Old Testament Study, 1917-1967|author= THOMAS, D. WINTON| page=121}}</ref> In spite of this regression, the king of Halab remained the mightiest king of the Syrian states as he was referred to as [[Great King]] by the Hittites hence he was the diplomatic equal of the Hittite king.<ref name="Hamblin" />

Yamhad was able to withstand the Hittite king [[Hattusili I]] aggressions through alliances with the Hurrians. Hattusili chose not to attack Halab directly and began with conquering Yamhad vassals and Allies, starting with Alalakh in the second year of his Syrian campaigns c. 1650 BC ([[Middle chronology]]) or slightly later.<ref>{{cite book|url=http://books.google.nl/books?id=RTGc9YH-C38C&pg=PA97#v=onepage&q&f=false|title= Ancient Near Eastern Art|author= Dominique Collon|page=97}}</ref> He then turned to attack the Hurrians in [[Urshu]] northeast of Halab and won in despite of Halab and Charchemish military support. After defeating Yamhad in a direct battle, Hattusili sacked [[Khashshum]] and several other Hurrian cities. 

After many campaigns Hattusili I finally attacked Halab during the reign of [[Hammurabi III]], the attack ended in a defeat,<ref>{{cite book|url=http://books.google.nl/books?id=FF5-7JVj4jYC&pg=PA33#v=onepage&q&f=false|title= The Cambridge Ancient History|author= Iorwerth Eiddon Stephen Edwards|page=33}}</ref> the wounding of the Hittite king and his later death in c. 1620 BC.<ref>{{cite book|url=http://books.google.nl/books?id=q8Z7AgAAQBAJ&pg=PA29&dq#v=onepage&q&f=false|title= Ancient Syria: A Three Thousand Year History|author= Trevor Bryce|page=29}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|url=http://books.google.nl/books?id=azPl5Jzv930C&pg=PA107#v=onepage&q&f=false|title= Historical Dictionary of the Hittites|author= Charles Burney|page=107}}</ref> Hattusili Campaigns considerably weakened Halab causing it to lose its status and the ruler of Yamhad ceased to be a Great King.<ref>{{cite book|url=http://books.google.nl/books?id=Agg5-lpVI2MC&pg=PA152&dq#v=onepage&q&f=false|title= The Kingdom of the Hittites|author= Trevor Bryce|page=152}}</ref>

Hattusili was succeeded by his grandchild [[Mursili I]] who conquered Halab in c. 1600 BC and destroyed Yamhad as a major power in the [[Levant]].<ref>{{cite book|url=http://books.google.nl/books?id=biyDDd0uKGMC&pg=PT256&dq#v=onepage&q&f=false|title= Warfare in the Ancient Near East to 1600 BC|author= William J.

Halab was taken by the Hittites during the reign of [[Suppiluliuma I]] in the 14th century BC who installed his son Telipinus as king of Halab but the use of the name Yamhad ended.

==Economy==
Halab location has always been a factor in its prominence as an economic center, Yamhad economy was based on trade with [[Mesopotamia]] and [[Anatolia]], the city of [[Emar]],<ref name="Mario" /><ref>{{cite book|url=http://books.google.nl/books?id=_7kP_hNKHxIC&pg=PA23#v=onepage&q&f=false|title= Representations of Political Power|author= Marlies Heinz,Marian H.

The actions of Yarim-Lim I proved vital for the kingdom economy, for he has secured the road between Babylon and Yamhad with his son in low the king of Mari protecting the caravans crossing from the [[Persian Gulf]] to [[Anatolia]].

Emar attracted many Babylonian merchants who lived in the city and had a lasting impact on the local scribal conventions since as late as the 14th-century BC texts of the so-called (Syrian type) from Emar preserve distinct Babylonian traits.

The invading of Mari by Babylon had a negative impact on trade between the two kingdoms as the road became dangerous because of the loss of Mari protection to the caravans crossing that road, which led [[Samsu-iluna]] to build strongholds up the river valley and to set colonies of mercenaries known as the Kassite Houses to protect the middle Euphrates area. Those colonies later evolved into semi independent polities that waged war against Babylonian king [[Ammi-Saduqa]] which caused the trade to stop temporarily.<ref>{{cite book|url=http://books.google.nl/books?id=akYorRIWPBEC&pg=PA212#v=onepage&q&f=false|title= The Babylonian World|author= Gwendolyn Leick|page= 212}}</ref>

The markets of yamhad became a source of mountain (probably Anatolian) and Cypriot copper,<ref>{{cite book|url=http://books.google.nl/books?id=akYorRIWPBEC&pg=PA213#v=onepage&q&f=false|title= The Babylonian World|author= Gwendolyn Leick|page= 213}}</ref> and economy remained prosperous until the Hittites Invasion in the beginning of the 16th century BC. Halab regained its economic status after the Hittites withdrawal and remained a Commercial center even after the end of Yamhad thanks to its location.

==People and culture==
The people of Yamhad were Amorites, spoke the [[Amorite language]] and belonged to the Amorite culture with Mesopotamian influence. Since Halab wasn't excavated, the architecture of the city can be imagined by looking into other cities in the area of that age, especially Alalakh which is the best archaeological representation of Yamhad,<ref>{{cite book|url=http://books.google.nl/books?id=_7kP_hNKHxIC&pg=PA55#v=onepage&q&f=false|title= Representations of Political Power|author= Marlies Heinz,Marian H. Feldman|page= 55}}</ref> and was subordinate to Halab with a king belonging to the Aleppan royal family. The Amorites in general built large palaces that bear architectural similarities to old Baylonian palaces that were adorned with grand central courtyards, throne rooms, tiled floors, drainage systems and plastered walls which suggest the employment of specialized labor, evidences exist for the presence of Minoan Aegean Frisco artists who painted elaborate scenes on the walls of palaces in Alalakh.<ref>{{cite book|url=http://books.google.nl/books?id=5H4fAgAAQBAJ&pg=PT434#v=onepage&q&f=false|title= The Oxford Handbook of the Archaeology of the Levant: c. 8000-332 BCE|author= Margreet L. Steiner,Ann E. Killebrew|page= 409}}</ref>

Yamhad had a distinctive Syrian Iconography, Egyptian influence was minimum and limited to the [[Ankh]], the seals of kings gives prominence to Syrian gods, the use of the Ankh cannot be interpreted as an emulation of Egyptian rituals, it was merely a substitute to the cup held by the god.<ref>{{cite book|url=http://books.google.nl/books?id=oiSoxUE_Vn0C&pg=PA38&lpg#v|title= Egyptian Iconography on Syro-Palestinian Cylinder Seals of the Middle Bronze Age|author= Beatrice Teissier|page= 38}}</ref>

Yamhad had a special pattern of trim called the Yamhad style and was favored in Mari during the reign of king Zimri-Lim whose queen was Shibtu the daughter of Yarim-Lim I.<ref>{{cite book|url=http://books.google.nl/books?id=_oTh51M5XF4C&pg=PA51#v=onepage&q&f=false|title= Mari and Karana: Two Old Babylonian Cities|author= Stephanie Dalley|page= 51}}</ref>

After the fall of the Akkadian Empire, [[Hurrians]] began to settle in the city and its surroundings, blending with the [[Amorites]] and spreading their culture. by c. 1725 BC they constitute a sizable portion of the population.<ref>{{cite book|url=http://books.google.nl/books?id=odCmAQAAQBAJ&pg=PA72#v=onepage&q&f=false|title= Between Myth & Mandate|author= Michael Nathanson|page= 72}}</ref> the presence of large Hurrian population brought Hurrian culture and religion to Halab, evidenced by the worship of Hurrian gods [[Teshub]], his wife [[Hebat]] and certain religious festivals that bear Hurrian names.<ref name="Iorwerth">{{cite book|url=http://books.google.nl/books?id=FF5-7JVj4jYC&pg=PA41#v=onepage&q&f=false|title= The Cambridge Ancient History|author= Iorwerth Eiddon Stephen Edwards|page= 41}}</ref>

Beside the general gods, kings had a ''Head God'', that is a God that has an intimate connection for the worshiper. king Yarim-Lim I describe Hadad as the god of the state but the Mesopotamian God [[Sin (mythology)|Sin]] as the god of his head so does his son Hammurabi I.<ref>{{cite book|url=http://books.google.nl/books?id=VSJWkrXfbLQC&pg=PA77#v=onepage&q&f=false|title= Family Religion in Babylonia, Ugarit and Israel|author= K.
