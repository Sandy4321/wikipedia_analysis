'''''Sisters of Christian Charity''''', also called [[Daughters of the Immaculate Conception]], - a [[Roman Catholic]] institute for teaching poor schools and for the care of the blind. Founded at [[Paderborn]], [[Germany]], on August, [[1849]], by Pauline von Mallinckrodt (b. 3 June, [[1817]], at Minden, [[Westphalia]]; d. 30 April, [[1881]]), sister to the famous Hermann von Mallinckrodt. The institute, which was confirmed 7 Feb., [[1888]], by [[Pope Leo XIII]], had attained great success throughout Germany when, in [[1873]], its members were forced into exile by the persecution of the Kulturkampf. Some went to [[South America]], where there are now many flourishing communities. Others emigrated to [[New Orleans]], [[USA]], where, in April [[1873]], they founded a house and took charge of a parochial school. Mother Pauline followed shortly after and established a new provincial mother-house, at Wilkesbarre, [[Pennsylvania]]. Since then these sisters have opened houses in the Archdioceses of [[Baltimore]], [[Chicago]], [[Cincinnati]], [[New York]], [[Philadelphia]], [[St. Louis]], and [[St. Paul]], and in the Dioceses of [[Albany]], Belleville, [[Brooklyn]], [[Detroit]], Harrisburg, Newark, Sioux City, and Syracuse. In [[1910]], they had in these establishments 668 sisters, 46 novices, 25 postulants, conducting 2 academies, 54 parochial schools, 2 orphan asylums, and 1 industrial school. In [[1887]] the sisters were allowed to return to [[Germany]]. The mother-house at Paderborn was reopened and the activities of the religious extended with their former success throughout Germany. By [[1910]], there were houses in [[Belgium]] and [[Bohemia]].<ref>[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03711a.htm Catholic Encyclopedia Article]
