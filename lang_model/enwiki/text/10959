'''''Mein Kampf''''',  in [[English language|English]]: '''''My Struggle,''''' is a book by [[Adolf Hitler]]. It combines elements of [[autobiography]] with an exposition of [[Adolf Hitler's political beliefs|Hitler's political ideology]]. Volume 1 of ''Mein Kampf'' was published in 1925 and Volume 2 in 1926.<ref>''Mein Kampf'' ''("My Struggle"),'' Jackie (originally 1925<U+2013>1926), Reissue edition (September 15, 1998), Publisher: Mariner Books, Language: English, paperback, 720 pages, ISBN 0-395-92503-7</ref>

Hitler originally wanted to call his forthcoming book ''Viereinhalb Jahre (des Kampfes) gegen L<U+00FC>ge, Dummheit und Feigheit'', or ''Four and a Half Years (of Fighting) Against Lies, Stupidity and Cowardice''. Max Amman, head of the Franz Eher Verlag and Hitler's publisher, is said to have suggested<ref>Richard Cohen. "Guess Who's on the Backlist." ''[[New York Times]].'' Jun 28. 1998. Retrieved from http://www.nytimes.com/books/98/06/28/bookend/bookend.html on April 24, 2008.</ref> the much shorter ''"Mein Kampf,"'' often translated as ''"My Struggle,"'' ''"My Challenge,"'' ''"My Campaign,"'' or ''"My Battle."''

Hitler began the dictation of the book while imprisoned for what he considered to be "political crimes" after his failed revolution in Munich in November, 1923. Though Hitler received many visitors earlier on, he soon devoted himself entirely to the book. As he continued, Hitler realized that it would have to be a two-volume work, with the first volume scheduled for release in early 1925. The prison governor of Landsberg noted at the time that "he [Hitler] hopes the book will run into many editions, thus enabling him to fulfill his financial obligations and to defray the expenses incurred at the time of his trial."

Once released from prison on December 20, 1924, Hitler moved back to the picturesque mountainous climes of the [[Obersalzberg]]. While he was in power (1933<U+2013>1945), ''Mein Kampf'' came to be available in three common editions. The first, the ''Volksausgabe'' or People's Edition, featured the original cover on the dust jacket and was navy blue underneath with a gold swastika eagle embossed on the cover. The ''Hochzeitsausgabe'', or Wedding Edition, in a slipcase with the seal of the province embossed in gold onto a parchment-like cover was given free to marrying couples. In 1940, the ''Tornister-Ausgabe'' was released. This edition was a compact, but unabridged, version in a red cover and was released by the post office available to be sent to loved ones fighting at the front. These three editions combined both volumes into the same book.

A special edition was published in 1939 in honor of Hitler's 50th birthday. This edition was known as the ''Jubil<U+00E4>umsausgabe'', or Anniversary Issue. It came in both dark blue and bright red boards with a gold sword on the cover. This work contained both volumes one and two. It was considered a deluxe version, relative to the smaller and more common ''Volksausgabe''.

The book could also be purchased as a two-volume set during Hitler's reign, and was available in soft cover and hardcover. The soft cover edition contained the original cover (as pictured at the top of this article). The hardcover edition had a leather spine with cloth-covered boards. The cover and spine contained an image of three brown oak leaves.

*Conclusion

*Index

In ''Mein Kampf'', Hitler uses the main thesis of "the Jewish peril," which speaks of an alleged Jewish conspiracy to gain world leadership. The narrative describes the process by which he became increasingly anti-Semitic and [[militarism|militaristic]], especially during his years in Vienna, Austria. Yet, the deeper origins of his anti-semitism remain a mystery. He speaks of not having met a Jew until he arrived in Vienna, and that at first his attitude was liberal and tolerant. When he first encountered the anti-semitic press, he says, he dismissed it as unworthy of serious consideration. A little later and quite suddenly, it seems, he accepted the same anti-semitic views whole-heartedly, which became crucial in his program of national reconstruction. Becoming acquainted with [[Zionism]], which he calls a "great movement," is what Hitler claims coalesced his view that one cannot be both a German and a Jew.

''Mein Kampf'' has also been studied as a work on [[political theory]]. For example, Hitler announces his hatred of what he believed to be the world's twin evils: [[Communism]] and [[Judaism]]. The new territory that Germany needed to obtain would properly nurture the "historic destiny" of the German people; this goal explains why Hitler invaded Europe, both East and West, before he launched his attack against Russia. Blaming Germany<U+2019>s chief woes on the [[Reichstag (institution)|parliament]] of the [[Weimar Republic]], he announces that he wants to completely destroy the parliamentary system.

''Mein Kampf'' has additionally been examined as a book on foreign policy. For example, Hitler predicts the stages of Germany<U+2019>s political emergence on the world scene: in the first stage, Germany would, through a program of massive re-armament, overthrow the shackles of the [[Treaty of Versailles]] and form alliances with the [[British Empire]] and [[Kingdom of Italy (1861<U+2013>1946)|Fascist Italy]]. The second stage would feature wars against [[France]] and her allies in [[Eastern Europe]] by the combined forces of Germany, Britain and Italy. The third and final stage would be a war to destroy what Hitler saw as the "[[Judeo-Bolshevik]]" regime in the [[Soviet Union]] that would give Germany the necessary ''[[Lebensraum]]''(literally "living space"). German historian [[Andreas Hillgruber]] labeled the plans contained in ''Mein Kampf'' as Hitler's "[[Stufenplan]]" ("stage-by-stage plan"). The term ''Stufenplan'' has been widely used by historians, though it must be noted that the term was Hillgruber's, not Hitler's.

==English translation==
{{refimprove|section}}
===Dugdale abridgment===
{{unreferenced|section}}
The first English translation was an abridgment by [[Edgar Dugdale]] who started work on it in 1931, at the prompting of his wife, Blanche. When he learned that the London publishing firm of [[Hurst & Blackett]] had secured the rights to publish an abridgment in the United Kingdom, he offered it for free in April 1933. However, a local Nazi representative insisted that the translation be further abridged before publication, so it was held back from the public until October 13, 1933, although excerpts were allowed to run in ''[[The Times]]'' in late July.

In America, [[Houghton Mifflin]] secured the rights to the Dugdale abridgment on July 29, 1933. The only differences between the American and British versions are that the title was translated ''My Struggle'' in the UK and ''My Battle'' in America; and that Dugdale is credited as translator in the U.S. edition, while the British version withheld his name. Both Dugdales were active in the [[Zionism|Zionist]] movement; Blanche was the niece of [[Lord Balfour]], and they wished to avoid publicity.

===Murphy translation===
{{unreferenced|section}}
One of the first complete English translations of ''Mein Kampf'' was by [[James Vincent Murphy|James Murphy]] in 1939. The opening line, ''"It has turned out fortunate for me to-day that [[destiny]] appointed Braunau-on-the-Inn to be my birthplace,"'' is characteristic of Hitler's sense of destiny that began to develop in the early 1920s.

Hurst & Blackett ceased publishing the Murphy translation in 1942 when the original plates were destroyed by German bombing.

===Reynal and Hitchcock translation===
{{unreferenced|section}}
Houghton and Mifflin licensed [[Reynal & Hitchcock]] the rights to publish a full unexpurgated translation in 1938. It was translated by a committee of men from the [[New School for Social Research]] and appeared on February 28, 1939.

===Stackpole translation and controversy===
{{unreferenced|section}}
The small Pennsylvania firm of Stackpole and Sons released its own unexpurgated translation by [[William Soskin]] on the same day as [[Houghton Mifflin]], amid much legal wrangling. The [[Second Circuit Court of Appeals]] ruled in Houghton Mifflin's favour that June and ordered Stackpole to stop selling their version, but litigation followed for a few more years until the case was finally resolved in September 1941.

Among other things, Stackpole argued that Hitler could not have legally transferred his right to a copyright in the United States to Eher Verlag in 1925, because he was not a citizen of any country. ''Houghton Mifflin v. Stackpole'' was a minor landmark in American [[copyright law]], definitively establishing that [[stateless persons]] have the same copyright status in the United States that any other foreigner would.

In the three months that Stackpole's version was available it sold 12,000 copies.

===Cranston translation and controversy===
{{refimprove|section}}
Some historians have speculated that a wider readership prior to Hitler's rise to power, or at least prior to the outbreak of World War II, might have alerted the world to the dangers Hitler would pose to peace in Europe and to [[the Holocaust]] that he would pursue. An abridged English translation was produced before World War II. However, Houghton Mifflin removed some of the more anti-Semitic and militaristic statements. The publication of this version caused [[Alan Cranston]], an American reporter for [[United Press International]] in Germany (and later a [[United States Senate|U.S. Senator]] from [[California]]), to publish his own abridged and annotated translation. Cranston believed this version more accurately reflected the contents of the book and Hitler's intentions. In 1939, Cranston was sued by Hitler's publisher for copyright infringement, and a Connecticut judge ruled in Hitler's favor. However, by the time the publication of Cranston's version was stopped, 500,000 copies had already been sold.{{fact}}

Today, the profits and proceeds are given to various charities. <ref> [http://www.cabinetmagazine.org/issues/10/mein_royalties.php/ Mein Royalties] Cabinet Magazine Online </ref>

===Manheim translation===
{{unreferenced|section}}
[[Houghton Mifflin]] brought out a translation by [[Ralph Manheim]] in 1943. They did this to avoid having to share their profits with Reynal & Hitchcock, and to increase sales by offering a more readable translation. The Manheim translation was first published in England by Hurst & Blackett in 1969 amid some controversy.

The two volumes of ''Mein Kampf'' are titled as follows:<br />
Volume I: A Retrospect (contains 12 chapters)<br />
Volume II: The Nationalist Socialist Movement (contains 15 chapters)

There were three separate printings from August 1938 to March 1939, totaling 14,000; sales totals by March 31, 1939 were 10,345.

The Murphy and Houghton Mifflin translations were the only ones published by the authorized publishers while Hitler was still alive, and not at war with Britain and America.

There was some resistance from Eher Verlag to Hurst and Blackton's Murphy translation, as they had not been granted the rights to a full translation. However, they allowed it ''de facto'' permission by not lodging a formal protest, and on May 5, 1939, even inquired about royalties. The British publishers responded on the 12th that the information they requested was "not yet available" and the point would be moot within a few months, on September 3, 1939, when all royalties were halted due to the state of war existing between Britain and Germany.

Royalties were likewise held up in the United States due to the litigation between Houghton Mifflin and Stackpole. Because the matter was only settled in September 1941, only a few months before a state of war existed between Germany and the U.S., all Eher Verlag ever got was a $2,500 advance from Reynal and Hitchcock. It got none from the unauthorized Stackpole edition or the 1943 Manheim edition.

From the royalties, Hitler was able to afford a Mercedes while still [[Adolf Hitler#Beer Hall Putsch|imprisoned]]. Moreover, he accumulated a tax debt of 405,500 [[German reichsmark|Reichsmark]] (8 million USD today, or <U+00A3>4m UK Pounds Sterling) from the sale of about 240,000 copies by the time he became chancellor in 1933 (at which time his debt was waived).<ref name="taxes"> [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/4105683.stm Hitler dodged taxes, expert finds] BBC News </ref><ref name="spiegel">[http://www.spiegel.de/kultur/gesellschaft/0,1518,druck-433526,00.html Mythos Ladenh<U+00FC>ter] Spiegel Online </ref> 

After Hitler's rise to power, the book gained enormous popularity and for all intents and purposes became the Nazi Bible. (Two other books written by party members, [[Gottfried Feder]]'s ''Breaking The Interest Slavery'' and [[Alfred Rosenberg]]'s ''The Myth Of The Twentieth Century,'' have since lapsed into comparative literary obscurity, and few intact copies of either <U+2014> including no known translations from the original German for Feder's book <U+2014> are currently known to exist.) Despite rumors to the contrary, new evidence suggests that it was actually in high demand in libraries and often reviewed and quoted in other publications. By the end of the war, about 10 million copies of the book had been sold or distributed in Germany and Hitler had made about 1.2 m Reichsmarks from the income of his book in 1933, when the average annual income of a teacher was about 4,800 Mark.<ref name="taxes" /><ref name="spiegel" /> During Hitler's years in power, the book was given free to every newlywed couple and every soldier fighting at the front.

==Criticism==
''Mein Kampf'', due to its racist content and the historical effect of Nazism upon Europe during the [[Second World War]] and the [[Holocaust]], is considered a highly controversial book. However, criticism has not come solely from direct opponents of Nazism. Italian Fascist dictator [[Benito Mussolini]], himself experienced in writing and editing for newspapers, was also critical of the book. Mussolini attempted to read the book, but was disappointed and claimed that ''Mein Kampf'' was "a boring [[tome]] that I have never been able to read" and remarked that Hitler's beliefs expressed in the book were "little more than commonplace clich<U+00E9>s."<ref>Smith. 1983. Mussolini: A Biography. New York: Vintage Books. p172</ref> In more modern times, the conservative magazine ''[[Human Events]]'' listed ''Mein Kampf'' as the 2nd most harmful book in the world, after ''[[The Communist Manifesto]]'', in its list of the "Ten Most Harmful Books of the 19th and 20th Centuries."<ref name="most_harmful">[http://www.humanevents.com/article.php?id=7591 Ten Most Harmful Books of the 19th and 20th Centuries], accessed August 24, 2007</ref>

==Current availability== 
At the time of his death, Hitler's official place of residence was in [[Munich]], which led to his entire estate, including all rights to ''Mein Kampf'', changing to the ownership of the state of [[Bavaria]]. As per German [[copyright]] law, the entire text is scheduled to enter the [[public domain]] on December 31, 2015, just over 70 years after the author's death. The copyright has been relinquished for the English, Dutch and Swedish editions. Historian Werner Maser, in an interview with ''[[Bild-Zeitung|Bild am Sonntag]]'' has stated that [[Peter Raubal]], son of Hitler's nephew, [[Leo Raubal]], would have a strong legal case for winning the copyright from Bavaria if he pursued it. Peter Raubal, an Austrian engineer, has stated he wants no part of the rights to the book, even though it could be worth millions of [[euros]].<ref>

     [[Reuters]], May 25, 2004.
</ref>
The government of Bavaria, in agreement with the federal government of Germany, refuses to allow any copying or printing of the book in Germany, and opposes it also in other countries but with less success. Owning and buying the book is legal. Trading in old copies is legal as well, unless it is done in such a fashion as to "promote hatred or war," which is generally illegal under anti-[[historical revisionism (negationism)|revisionist]] laws. In particular, the unmodified edition is not covered by <U+00A7>86 [[StGB]] that forbids dissemination of means of propaganda of unconstitutional organizations, since it is a "pre-constitutional work" and as such cannot be opposed to the free and democratic basic order, according to a 1979 decision of the [[Federal Court of Justice of Germany]].<ref>Judgement of July 25, 1979 <U+2013> 3 StR 182/79 (S); BGHSt 29, 73 ff.</ref> Most German libraries carry heavily commented and excerpted versions of ''Mein Kampf.''

* In [[Austria]], the possession and/or trading of ''Mein Kampf'' is illegal. 
* In [[People's Republic of China]], ''Mein Kampf'' is forbidden and only available in selected libraries for research purposes.
* In [[France]], the selling of the book is forbidden unless the transaction concerns a historical version including commentaries from specialists and states the law allowing its special historical edition. In 2002, a French court ruled that the company Yahoo! had to pay <U+20AC>100,000 per diem for selling revisionist materials, including ''Mein Kampf'' and ''[[The Protocols of the Elders of Zion]]'', to French customers.<ref> [http://www.legalis.net/cgi-iddn/french/affiche-jnet.cgi?droite=decisions/responsabilite/ord_tgi-paris_220500.htm Legalis.net] </ref> 
* In [[Mexico]], its sale is prohibited by law, but can be encountered in some small book stores and among "pirate" book vendors in [[Mexico City]] and other cities.
* In the [[Netherlands]], selling the book, even in the case of an old copy, may be illegal as "promoting hatred," but possession and lending is not. The matter is generally handled as a matter of copyright infringement against the Dutch government, who owns the translation, though it refuses to allow any publishing. In 1997, the government explained to the parliament that selling a scientifically annotated version might escape prosecution. In 2015, the government's copyright on the Dutch translation becomes void.
* In [[Spain]] and [[Brazil]], the book is currently unavailable for publishing, but old copies printed previously still exist. 
* When ''Mein Kampf'' was republished in [[Sweden]] in 1992, the government of Bavaria tried to ban the book there. The case went to the [[Supreme Court of Sweden|Swedish Supreme Court]], who ruled in 1998 that the copyright could not be owned by the modern state of Bavaria. Since the publishing house that published ''Mein Kampf'' in the 1930s had long gone out of business, ''Mein Kampf'' should be considered to be in a state of limbo, or even in the public domain. The case was won by the modern publisher, an outspoken anti-Nazi.
* In the [[Soviet Union|USSR]], the book was unavailable and ''de facto'' prohibited. In the [[Russia|Russian Federation]], ''Mein Kampf'' has been published at least three times since 1992; the Russian text is also available on a number of websites. Recently the [[Public Chamber of Russia]] proposed banning the book.
* In 1999, the [[Simon Wiesenthal Center]] documented that major Internet booksellers like [[amazon.com]] and [[Barnes & Noble|barnesandnoble.com]] sell ''Mein Kampf'' to Germany. After a public outcry, both companies agreed to stop those sales. The book is currently available through both companies. Public-domain copies of ''Mein Kampf'' are available at various Internet sites with links to [[banned books]]. Additionally, several Web sites provide the text of the book.

==The sequel== 
{{main|Zweites Buch}}
After the party's poor showing in the 1928 elections, Hitler believed the reason for loss was that the public did not fully understand his ideas. He retired to Munich to dictate a sequel to ''Mein Kampf'' which focused on foreign policy, expanded on the ideas of ''Mein Kampf'' and suggested that around 1980, a final struggle would take place for world domination between the [[United States]] and the combined forces of [[Greater Germany]] and the [[British Empire]]. 

Only two copies of the 200-page manuscript were originally made, and only one of these has ever been made public. Kept strictly secret under Hitler's orders, the document was placed in a safe in an air raid shelter in 1935 where it remained until its discovery by an American officer in 1945. The authenticity of the book has been verified by Josef Berg (former employee of the Nazi publishing house Eher Verlag) and [[Telford Taylor]] (former Brigadier General U.S.A.R. and Chief Counsel at the Nuremberg war-crimes trials). The book was neither edited nor published during the [[Nazi Germany]] era and remains known as ''[[Zweites Buch]]'' (Second Book). The ''Zweites Buch'' was first discovered in the Nazi archives being held in the United States by the [[Jewish]] American historian [[Gerhard Weinberg]] in 1958. Unable to find an American publisher, Weinberg turned to his mentor, [[Hans Rothfels]], and his associate, [[Martin Broszat]], at the [[Institut f<U+00FC>r Zeitgeschichte|Institute of Contemporary History]] in [[Munich]], who published ''Zweites Buch'' in 1961. A pirated edition was published in English in New York, 1962. The first authoritative English edition was not published until 2003 (''[[Hitler's Second Book: The Unpublished Sequel to Mein Kampf]],'' ISBN 1-929631-16-2).

==Globalists vs. continentists==
One of the more important debates of the book concerns the battle between the Continentists, including [[Hugh Trevor-Roper, Baron Dacre of Glanton|Hugh Trevor-Roper]] and [[Eberhard J<U+00E4>ckel]], who argue Hitler wished to conquer only Europe, and the Globalists, including [[Gerhard Weinberg]], Milan Hauner, Gunter Moltmann, Meier Michaelis and [[Andreas Hillgruber]], who maintain that Hitler wanted to conquer the entire world. The chief source of contention between the Continentists and Globalists is the ''[[Zweites Buch]].''

The Globalists argue that Hitler's statement that after Germany defeated the United States, then Germany would rule the entire world clearly proves his intentions were global in reach. The Continentists argue that because Hitler predicts the war between the United States and Germany as beginning sometime ca. 1980, the task of winning this war in the 1980s would presumably have fallen to one of Hitler<U+2019>s successors, as Hitler would have been at least 90 years old. The Continentists believe that Hitler, for his own lifetime, would have been content with ruling merely Europe.

==Intentionalists vs. functionalists==
''Mein Kampf'' has assumed a key place in the [[functionalism versus intentionalism]] debate. Intentionalists insist that the passage stating that if only 12,000<U+2013>15,000 Jews were gassed, then "the sacrifice of millions of soldiers would not have been in vain," proves quite clearly that Hitler had a master plan for the [[genocide]] of the Jewish people all along. Functionalists deny this assertion, noting that the passage does not call for the destruction of the entire Jewish people and note that although ''Mein Kampf'' is suffused with an extreme anti-Semitism, it is the only time in the entire book that Hitler ever explicitly refers to the murder of Jews. Given that ''Mein Kampf'' is 694 pages long, Functionalist historians have accused the Intentionalists of making too much out of one sentence.

Functionalist historians have argued that the memorandum written by [[Heinrich Himmler]] to Hitler on May 25, 1940, regarding the "[[Final Solution to the Jewish Question]]," whose proposals Hitler accepted, proves that there was no master plan for genocide which stemmed back to the 1920s. In the memorandum, Himmler rejects [[genocide]] under the grounds that one must reject "...the Bolshevik method of physical extermination of a people out of inner conviction as un-German and impossible." He goes on to argue that something similar to the "[[Madagascar Plan]]" be the preferred "territorial solution" to the "[[Jewish Question]]."

Additionally, Functionalist historians have noted that in ''Mein Kampf'' Hitler states the only anti-Semitic policies he will carry out are the 25 Point Platform of the Nazi Party (adopted in February 1920), which demands that only "Aryan" Germans be allowed to publish newspapers and own department stores, places a ban on Jewish immigration, expels all ''Ostjuden'' (Eastern Jews; i.e., Jews from Eastern Europe who had arrived in Germany since 1914) and strips all German Jews of their German citizenship. Although these demands do reflect a hateful anti-Semitism, they do not amount to a program for genocide, according to the Functionalist historians. Beyond that, some historians have claimed although Hitler was clearly obsessed with anti-Semitism, his degree of anti-Semitic hatred contained in ''Mein Kampf'' is no better or worse than that contained in the writings and speeches of earlier ''[[V<U+00F6>lkisch movement|volkisch]]'' leaders such as [[Wilhelm Marr]], [[Georg Ritter von Sch<U+00F6>nerer]], [[Houston Stewart Chamberlain]] and [[Karl Lueger]], all of whom routinely called Jews a "disease" and "vermin." Nevertheless, Hitler cites all of them as an inspiration in ''Mein Kampf.''

== Hitler and the "Sanctity of Life" ==
Mein Kampf was significant in 1925 because it was an open source for the presentation of Hitler's ideas about the state of the world. The book is significant in our time because a retrospective review of the text reveals the crystallization of Hitler's decision to completely exterminate the Jewish race. While historians diverge on the exact date Hitler decided to exterminate the Jewish people, few place the decision before the mid 1930s.<ref>Christopher Browning, <U+201C>Initiating the Final Solution: The Fateful Months of September-October 1941,<U+201D> Miles Lerman Center for the Study of Jewish Resistance, U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum (Washington, DC: USHMM, 2003) pg. 12</ref> First published in 1925, Mein Kampf shows the ideas that crafted Hitler's historical grievances and ambitions for creating a new world order. Taken together with other sources, historians such as Professor [[Gunnar Heinsohn]] demonstrate that Hitler's plan for the Jews and Aryans alike was not confined to a racial conception but rather an ideological one<ref>Gunnar Heinsohn, <U+201C>What Makes the Holocaust a Uniquely Unique Genocide,<U+201D> Journal of Genocide Research, vol. 2, no. 3 (2000): 413</ref>. It was the propagation of "Jewish ideas"<ref>Ibid.</ref> that Hitler targeted for extermination with relation to the destruction of their community and race. Nearing the end of his reign, Hitler made such ideas clear in a correspondence with [[Martin Bormann]] on February 3, 1945:

<blockquote>
<U+201C>We use the term Jewish race merely for reasons of linguistic convenience, for in the real sense of the word, and from a genetic point of view, there is no Jewish race. [...] The Jewish race is above all a community of the spirit. Spiritual race is of a more solid and more durable kind than natural race.<U+201D><ref>Ibid., 412</ref>
</blockquote> 

His hatred for the "community of the spirit" connected with his conceptualization of what the Jewish people really stood for. But even his image of the Aryan race did not involve some kind of immutable purity, arguing that many factors, from wars to international trade, had perverted the purity of races that once existed in the past<ref>Ibid.</ref>. Hitler kept such ideas to private conversations and out of his public orations or texts, such as ''Mein Kampf'', because he did not want to lose the support of certain racist groups<ref>Ibid.</ref>. To Hitler, the problem in his time period lay in the ideas he attributed to the Jewish community. His correspondence with the future Nazi leader of Danzig, Hermann Rausching, clearly shows the culpability of Jewish ideas in Hitler's historical framework. 

According to Rausching's recollection of the meeting, Hitler referred to the Third Reich as a revolution of moral principles of man rather than "merely a political and social one."<ref>Ibid., 418</ref> Indeed, the Third Reich fit neatly into Hitler's concept of history, which he divided into three periods. The first age, the age of antiquity, was a time where infanticide and complete destruction of the enemy were encouraged to keep a race pure and strong. The second, middle age, is the one Hitler wanted to dismantle through the moral revolution he spoke of. The middle age, or the age of intervening, as Hitler called it, was a Jewish invention that created the sanctity of life by way of the Tablets of Mount Sinai. The Ten Commandments, specifically the fifth one, Thou Shalt Not Kill, is the idea Hitler wanted to cleanse from the German consciousness<ref>Ibid., 419</ref> through the coming of the third age or the Third Reich. On a factual level, the meeting between Rausching and Hitler is controversial.<ref>Ibid.</ref> Rausching's recollection of Hitler's beliefs was based on his own interpretation of the meeting and not supported by stenographic notes, casting doubts on his version's validity. However, research by historians and Hitler's own words in different periods lend much legitimacy to Raucshing's claims. 

Significantly, during the Eastern Campaigns and the intensification of Jewish extermination, Hitler stated that the Third Reich was writing a new kind of history.<ref>Christopher Browning, <U+201C>Initiating the Final Solution: The Fateful Months of September-October 1941,<U+201D> Miles Lerman Center for the Study of Jewish Resistance, U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum (Washington, DC: USHMM, 2003)pg. 12</ref> In labeling the Holocaust as a "uniquely unique"<ref>Gunnar Heinsohn, <U+201C>What Makes the Holocaust a Uniquely Unique Genocide,<U+201D> Journal of Genocide Research, vol. 2, no. 3 (2000): pg. 411</ref> genocide, the historian Gunnar Heinsohn provides evidence of Hitler's ideas that clearly parallel his ambition to institute a new historical age based on antique values. During the war, Hitler remarked that peace could only be achieved by a return to the natural order where the strong dominate the weak: an order that was corrupted by the Jews.<ref>Ibid. 416</ref> In other instances, Hitler justifies the destruction of entire cities because, in his view, it was necessary to "revert to antique principles."<ref>Ibid. pg. 420</ref> Hitler also looked to both Genghis Khan and Sparta to support his ideas of natural selection with the necessary historical backing. Thus, at a Nazi party convention in 1929 Hitler argued against the "Jewish train of thought:"<ref>Ibid., 416</ref>

<blockquote>
<U+201C>The worst danger is that we are interrupting the natural selection process ourselves (by caring for the sick and the weak). ... The most far-sighted racial state in history, Sparta, systematically implemented these racial laws.<U+201D><ref>Ibid.</ref>
</blockquote> 

The racial laws Hitler referred to resonate directly with his ideas in Mein Kampf. In his first edition of Mein Kampf, Hitler stated that the destruction of the weak and sick is far more humane than their protection. However, apart from his allusion to humane treatment, Hitler saw a purpose in destroying "the weak" in order to provide the proper space and purity for the strong.<ref>A. Hitler. Mein Kampf (Munich: Franz Eher Nachfolger, 1930), pg 478</ref> In the book he attributed the corruption of such a natural order to the equality of human beings created and spread by "the Jew." Heinson argues that such convictions, espoused in Mein Kampf, primarily attacked ideas rather than race. Thus, in one analogy, Heinson states that Hitler wanted to destroy "the hardware <U+2013> Jewish men, women and children <U+2013> to destroy the software <U+2013> the Jewish code of ethics."<ref>Gunnar Heinsohn, <U+201C>What Makes the Holocaust a Uniquely Unique Genocide,<U+201D> Journal of Genocide Research, vol. 2, no. 3 (2000): pg. 426</ref> Indeed, several years before the publication of Mein Kampf, Hitler stated that: <U+201C>the influence of Judaism will never fade as long as its agent, the Jew, has not been removed from our midst.<U+201D><ref>Ibid., 424</ref> 

The implications of Heinsons article for ''Mein Kampf'' are important. The book, released before the start of World War II, foreshadowed much of the racial policy that would spread from the domestic front in German homes to the newly acquired territory of the Third Reich. However, as Heinson demonstrates, the wide range of people chosen for extermination does not only represent a racist ideology, but also a whole new conception of how the world <U+2013> and history <U+2013> should function. By ordering the total extermination of the Jewish people, Hitler was training a nation to more easily engage in future genocides and simultaneously attempting to remove the very code of ethics that made it difficult to conceptualize such large scale slaughter of innocent people.<ref>Ibid., 426</ref>
