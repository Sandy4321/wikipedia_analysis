The '''RDS-1''' ({{lang-ru|<U+0420><U+0414><U+0421>-1}}), also known as '''''Izdeliye 501''''' (article 501) and '''''First Lightning''''' ({{lang|ru|<U+041F><U+0435><U+0440><U+0432><U+0430><U+044F> <U+043C><U+043E><U+043B><U+043D><U+0438><U+044F>}}, ''Pervaya molniya''), was used in the [[Soviet Union]]'s first [[nuclear testing|nuclear weapon test]], the [[United States]] assigned it the code-name '''Joe-1''', in reference to [[Joseph Stalin]]. It was exploded on 29 August 1949 at 7 in the morning,<ref name=Theplace>{{cite news|last=Kjelstrup|first=Christian|title=Dette er stedet der Sovjet testet atombombene sine|url=http://www.dn.no/dnlordag/article2661162.ece|newspaper=[[Dagens N<U+00E6>ringsliv]]|date=2013-08-11}}</ref> at [[Semipalatinsk Test Site|Semipalatinsk]], [[Kazakh SSR]], after a top-secret [[Research and development|R&D project]].<ref name="Peslyak">{{cite web |last=Peslyak |first=Alexander |title=Russia: building a nuclear deterrent for the sake of peace (60th anniversary of the first Soviet atomic test) |url=http://en.rian.ru/analysis/20090831/155977682.html |date=August 31, 2009 |publisher=RIA Novosti |accessdate=2010-04-05}}</ref> The weapon was designed at the [[Kurchatov Institute]]<U+2014>at the time officially known as "Laboratory <U+2116> 2," but designated as the "office" or "base" in internal documents<U+2014>starting in April 1946. A [[uranium-235]] plant was built near [[Chelyabinsk]] in 1948.<ref name="Peslyak"/>

The ''RDS-1'' explosion yielded 22 [[TNT equivalent|kilotons of TNT]], similar to the American ''[[The gadget|Gadget]]'' and ''[[Fat Man]]'' bombs. At [[Lavrenty Beria]]'s insistence, the ''RDS-1'' bomb was designed as an [[Nuclear_weapon_design#Implosion_type_weapon|implosion]] weapon similar to the ''Fat Man'' bomb dropped on [[Nagasaki, Nagasaki|Nagasaki]], [[Japan]]; RDS-1 also had a solid [[plutonium]] core. The bomb designers had developed a more sophisticated design (tested later as [[RDS-2]]), but rejected it due to the known reliability of the ''Fat Man'' type design; the USSR having received extensive [[atomic spies|intelligence]] on the design of the "Fat Man" bomb during [[World War II]]. 

In order to test the effects of the new weapon, workers constructed houses made of wood and bricks, along with a bridge, and a simulated [[Rapid transit|metro]] in the vicinity of the test site. Armoured hardware and approximately 50 aircraft were also brought to the testing grounds, as well as over 1,500 animals to test the bomb's effects on life.<ref name="Peslyak"/> The resulting data showed the RDS explosion to be 50% more destructive than originally estimated by its engineers.<ref name="Peslyak"/> 

There are several explanations for the USSR code-name of ''RDS-1'', usually an arbitrary designation: a [[backronym]] "Special Jet Engine" ({{lang|ru|<U+0420><U+0435><U+0430><U+043A><U+0442><U+0438><U+0432><U+043D><U+044B><U+0439> <U+0434><U+0432><U+0438><U+0433><U+0430><U+0442><U+0435><U+043B><U+044C> <U+0441><U+043F><U+0435><U+0446><U+0438><U+0430><U+043B><U+044C><U+043D><U+044B><U+0439>}}, ''Reaktivnyi Dvigatel Spetsialnyi''), or "Stalin's Jet Engine" ({{lang|ru|<U+0420><U+0435><U+0430><U+043A><U+0442><U+0438><U+0432><U+043D><U+044B><U+0439> <U+0434><U+0432><U+0438><U+0433><U+0430><U+0442><U+0435><U+043B><U+044C> <U+0421><U+0442><U+0430><U+043B><U+0438><U+043D><U+0430>}}, ''Reaktivnyi Dvigatel Stalina''), or "Russia does it herself" ({{lang|ru|<U+0420><U+043E><U+0441><U+0441><U+0438><U+044F> <U+0434><U+0435><U+043B><U+0430><U+0435><U+0442> <U+0441><U+0430><U+043C><U+0430>}}, ''Rossiya Delayet Sama'').<ref name="Peslyak"/> Later weapons were also designated RDS, but with different model numbers.

[[Mikhail Pervukhin]] served as the chairman of the commission in charge of the RDS-1 testing.

==Response in the West==
The test surprised the Western powers. American intelligence had estimated that the Soviets would not produce an atomic weapon until 1953, while the British did not expect it until 1954.<ref name="aldrich199807">{{cite journal | url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/20097530 | title=British Intelligence and the Anglo-American 'Special Relationship' during the Cold War | author=Aldrich, Richard J. | journal=Review of International Studies | year=1998 | month=July | volume=24 | issue=3 | pages=331-351 | jstor=20097530 }}</ref> When the [[radioactive]] [[fission products]] from the test were detected by the US Air Force, the US began to follow the trail of the [[nuclear fallout]] debris.<ref name="burr20090922">[http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/nukevault/ebb286/ ''U.S. Intelligence and the Detection of the First Soviet Nuclear Test, September 1949''], William Burr, Washington, DC, September 22, 2009</ref> President Truman notified the world of the situation on September 23, 1949: "We have evidence that within recent weeks an atomic explosion occurred in the U.S.S.R."<ref name="Truman">{{Cite web |url=http://www.trumanlibrary.org/chron/49chron2.htm |title=The Truman Administration During 1949: A Chronology |editor=Raymond H.

Once the Soviet Union was confirmed to be in possession of the atomic bomb, pressure mounted to develop the first [[hydrogen bomb]].<ref name="Truman" />
