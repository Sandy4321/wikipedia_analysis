'''HIP 13044 b''' is a [[Jupiter]]-like [[extrasolar planet]] orbiting the old and metal-poor [[red giant]] star [[HIP 13044]], which is situated approximately 2,000 [[light years]] away from the Earth in the constellation [[Fornax]]. Its discovery was announced on November 18, 2010<ref name="Than2010-11-18" /> after observations using the FEROS spectrograph at [[La Silla Observatory]]. According to evolutionary theories, HIP 13044 was formed in another [[galaxy]], and became part of the [[Milky Way]] when the star's parent galaxy was absorbed by our own between six and nine billion years ago, the remnants of the galaxy forming the [[Helmi stream]].<ref name=Klement2010 /> The planet has a very irregular orbit that is probably derived from the gravitational instabilities associated with HIP 13044's transition into the [[red giant]] phase of its lifetime. At the time of its discovery, HIP 13044 b orbited what was noted as the oldest and most metal-poor star yet discovered.<ref name=Klement2010 />

== Discovery ==

The study that led to the discovery of the planet was performed by a team from the [[Max Planck Institute for Astronomy]].<ref name="Setiawan et al. 2010" /> HIP 13044 b, the discovered planet, is the first time that a [[planetary system]] has been discovered in a [[stellar stream]] of extragalactic origin.<ref name="Bowdler2010-11-18" />

Using the FEROS spectrograph of the 2.2m [[MPG/ESO telescope]] at the [[La Silla Observatory]] in Chile, the science team that discovered the planet took thirty-six [[radial velocity method|radial velocity]] measurements,<ref name=Klement2010 /> a process that involves detecting small wobbles in a star caused by a planet as it tugs on it.<ref name="Bowdler2010-11-18" /> The science team analyzed their observations in search of [[false positive]] alternatives that could also explain the signals detected by FEROS using [[photometry (astronomy)|photometric]] measurements that were taken and publicly released by [[SuperWASP]], an organization that searches for [[transit method|transiting]] planets. The team compared the oscillations that HIP 13044 undergoes to the absence of the aforementioned oscillation at a sixteen day interval, and determined that the most likely reason for the blockage of the signal was the presence of a planetary companion. It was also determined that the planet was most likely not captured from another star in the Milky Way after Helmi stream became a part of the galaxy, implying that HIP 13044 b indeed originated outside the Milky Way.<ref name=Klement2010 />

The discovery of the planet may also suggest the need for rethinking issues in [[planet formation]] and survival, since it is the first planet ever discovered to be circling a star that is both very old and extremely metal-poor.<ref name="Wall2010-11-18" /> The planet thus challenges the core-accretion model of planet formation, given that it may be unlikely a planetary core of sufficient mass was formed, and may signify it was formed via the competing disk instability model of planet formation. The planet's discovery was announced on November 18, 2010.<ref name="Than2010-11-18" /><ref name="Bowdler2010-11-18" /><ref name="Wall2010-11-18" /><ref name="Minogue2010-11-18" /><ref name="Spotts2010-11-18" /><ref name="Matson2010-11-18" /><ref name="Santini2010-11-18" />

== Host star ==
{{main|HIP 13044}}

HIP 13044 is an [[Stellar classification#Class F|F-type]] giant located in the [[Fornax (constellation)|Fornax]] constellation's [[Helmi stream]], a stellar stream consisting of stars that originated in a dwarf galaxy that collided and merged with the Milky Way between six and nine billion years ago.<ref name=Klement2010 /> The star is rotating somewhat quickly, possibly indicating that it may have swallowed its inner planets during its [[red giant]] phase.<ref name="Than2010-11-18" /> It has an eccentric galactic orbit, with a distance from 7 to 16 [[kiloparsec]]s.<ref name="HIP 13044 b at Exoplanet.eu" /> HIP 13044 has a [[solar mass|mass]] of 0.8 times that of the Sun and a [[solar radius|radius]] that is 6.7 times that of the Sun, making it a very diffuse star. The star is estimated to have an [[effective temperature]] of 6025 [[Kelvin scale|K]], making it hotter than the Sun; however, with a [[metallicity]] of [Fe/H] = <U+2212>2.09, the star is extremely iron-deficient, having approximately 0.008 times the amount of iron measured in the Sun's spectrum.<ref name="HIP 13044 b at Exoplanet.eu" /> HIP 13044 is an old star, and is estimated to be at most nine billion years old, nearly twice the age of the Sun.<ref name="HIP 13044 b at Exoplanet.eu" /> Stars of this age, metallicity, and evolved stage are not known nor expected to have planets according to current theories on planetary formation.<ref name=Klement2010 />

The star is now in the final stages of its life as a [[horizontal branch]] star, [[Triple-alpha process|fusing helium]] in its core. It is likely that the planet orbited farther away from the star before its red giant phase, and arrived at its current location due to frictional interactions with the star's outer gas envelope. As the star is expected to undergo another phase of expansion before becoming a [[white dwarf]], the planet's ultimate fate is uncertain.<ref name="Than2010-11-18" /><ref name="Bowdler2010-11-18" />

HIP 13044 is situated at a distance of 701 [[parsec]]s (2,286 [[light year]]s) from Earth. It has an [[apparent magnitude]] of 9.94, and thus is not visible from Earth with the unaided eye.<ref name="HIP 13044 b at Exoplanet.eu" />

==Characteristics==

HIP 13044 b is a [[Hot Jupiter]] with a [[Jupiter mass|mass]] of 1.25 times that of Jupiter. The planet orbits at a distance of 0.116 [[astronomical unit|AU]] every 16.2 days. HIP 13044 b has a large [[orbital eccentricity]] of 0.25, and thus has a very elliptical orbit.<ref name="HIP 13044 b at Exoplanet.eu" /> The planet's orbital eccentricity is of special note, for such an eccentric orbit is not typical or predicted for planets of its kind. It is believed that an unevenly distributed pattern of mass loss may have shifted the planet's orbit to its present pattern, or that a third body in the system is manipulating HIP 13044 b's orbit.<ref name=Klement2010 />

To compare, [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]] orbits the Sun at a distance of 0.387 AU every 87.97 days with an orbital eccentricity of 0.2056.<ref name=Mercury />

HIP 13044 b may have been part of a multiplanetary system before its host star entered its red giant phase. The system's planets were most likely consumed by the expanding [[stellar envelope]] of the star. The gravitational disturbances caused by the expanding stellar envelope could have caused HIP 13044 b's orbit to deteriorate until it spiraled into its present, extremely close orbit.<ref name=Klement2010 />
