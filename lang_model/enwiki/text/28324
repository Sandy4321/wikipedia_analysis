===Chew Your Own Brooch===

In 1998 Noten developed an ongoing project called ''Chew Your Own Brooch''. It was first explored at the Rotterdam [[Museum Boijmans van Beuningen|art museum Boijmans van Beuningen]]. Appr. 800 visitors, including many children, were given a piece of chewing gum and asked to "chew their own brooch". Once they were satisfied with the shape they had produced, the piece was put in a little box, marked, and judged by a panel. First, second and third place winners were then presented with their brooches, made of their own piece of chewing gum cast respectively in 24K gold, silver and bronze. For many years now Noten has provided clients with their own chewing kit. When the client is satisfied with the shape they produced the piece of gum is returned and a replica brooch is made cast in silver or gold.<ref name=Frieze2002>{{cite web |url=http://www.frieze.com/issue/article/of_mice_and_men/ |title=Of Mice and Men (Frieze Magazine, Issue 67, May 2002) | author=Lorna Lee Leslie |accessdate=2012-01-09 }}</ref><ref name="Crafts2009p45"/>

===Wearable Gold===

''Wearable Gold'' a.k.a. ''Object'' (2001) consists of a pair of inconspicuous black and white sling back shoes with 24K gold insoles, allowing the wearer to walk on gold without attracting too much attention, as well as providing security in less fortunate times. Noten got inspired when he met a stranger on a train, a Jewish man who spoke of the horrors of being in Auschwitz during the Second World War, and about money, poverty and death. The man explained that gold and diamonds were the only real currency and that he still carried gold inside his shoes for security against the next rainy day.<ref name="Frieze2002"/><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tednoten.com/about/publications/frame/2/ |title=Stuntman (Frame-28-2002, p.85) | author=Louise Schouwenberg |accessdate=2012-01-09 }}</ref> ''Wearable Gold 2'' are 24K gold glazed porcelain pendants that are much less inconspicuous and only serve to impress the onlooker as the real value in gold is limited.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://vandm.com/Wearable-gold-2/3_266_product=309697.aspx |title=Wearable Gold 2 (vandm.com) | author=V&M |accessdate=2012-01-09 }}</ref>

A similar concept, but now in silver, is Noten's ''N.T. 2011'', a 5&nbsp;kg 999/1000 silver bar one can carry around by its handle and shoulder strap. In a limited edition of 3 pieces.<ref name="dutchartevents"/><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ornamentumgallery.com/gallery/photo.php?photo=1614 |title=N.T. 2011 by Ted Noten (OrnamentumGallery.com) | author=Ornamentum Gallery |accessdate=2012-01-09 }}</ref>

===I Am Being Nice to My Colleagues===

Noten's design ''I Am Being Nice to My Colleagues'' (2001) consists of an A4 silver plate that is blank except for two indented concentric circles. This first ring is ready to wear. When the buyer wishes to have a new ring made, they can commission another designer to create another ring from the plate. Eventually only the silhouettes of previous rings will be left. Noten invites other designers to share his concept and create their own work within the concept's parameters.<ref name="Frieze2002"/><ref name="KYBERIA2005"/>

===Mercedes Brooch===

The ''Mercedes Brooch'' is made from steel parts cut from the body of a ''[[Mercedes-Benz E-Class|Mercedes-Benz E-Class 210 model]]'' luxury car. Noten started this project in 2001 with his work ''100 Pieces'' in which he took a section of a new car and divided it into 100 fragments, each unique in size and form. That way the brooch wearer could become part owner of a new Mercedes-Benz. Noten followed it up in 2003 with a different car. In 2007 and 2008 he just used the hood. The 2001 brooches are white, the 2003 red. Priced at <U+20AC>200.00 a piece.<ref name="Frieze2002"/><ref name="YATZER2009"/><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tednoten.com/about/publications/frame/3/ |title=Stuntman (Frame-28-2002, p.86) | author=Louise Schouwenberg |accessdate=2012-01-09 }}</ref>

===A Tiara for Maxima===

In 2002, Noten participated among 40 (21 in final) Dutch artists and designers in a [[tiara]] design competition honouring the marriage between [[Princess M<U+00E1>xima of the Netherlands|Maxima Zorreguieta]] and the Dutch crown prince [[Willem-Alexander, Prince of Orange|Willem-Alexander]]. Noten's design of a shiny chromed [[Polo|polo helmet]] with a clip-on tiara won first prize. The jury referred to it as a 'cheeky' design. Noten intended the tiara, with small portraits of all Dutch queens positioned as guardian angels on top, to be used in church during the wedding ceremony. Afterwards the princess could combine the tiara with the helmet to protect herself against [[paparazzi]] when she ventured into the city of [[Amsterdam]] (or if she felt confident enough her husband might want to wear the helmet).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tednoten.com/about/publications/frame/3/ |title=Stuntman (Frame-28-2002, p.87) | author=Louise Schouwenberg |accessdate=2012-01-09 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.heraldextra.com/lifestyles/article_1605199a-0ca1-51c8-be07-431410a58f9b.html |title=Kicky Headgear Fit for a Princess (The Washington Post, May 16, 2003) | author=Linda Hales |accessdate=2012-01-09 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2003/09/17/1063625077793.html?from=storyrhs |title=Dutch style to the Max (The Age Newspaper, September 18, 2003) | author=Stephen Crafti |accessdate=2012-01-09 }}</ref>

===The Pistol Saints===

The use of guns in Noten's work came about by chance. In the past Noten had felt uneasy about the large number of people in his neighbourhood that carried guns. Whenever he could he would ask people to give him their gun or he would buy it from them. He would then throw it away or keep it in store without any particular purpose for it. After a while he had quite a collection and he thought he might just as well use these guns in his works of art. It also gave him the idea of a project he called ''Design Against Crime'' in which he collaborated with the authorities to persuade people to give up their guns in return for a work of art.

Noten's work ''The Pistol Saints'' (2003) is part of the ''Design Against Crime'' project. Whenever Noten asked people why they carried a gun they said it made them feel more secure, although most of them never actually used their gun. This inspired him to copy what he called ''the soul of the gun'' in pieces of jewellery the owner could wear instead of the gun. ''The Pistol Saints'' consists of twelve golden brooches with imprints of a gun. On the brooches the gun markings can be clearly distinguished.

''The Pistol Saints'' received wide public attention when it was displayed at the 2004 exhibition on contemporary jewellery ''Geel metalliek: Goud voor Robert Smit'' at the [[Stedelijk Museum Amsterdam]]. This was because Noten not only then displayed the golden brooches but also, as part of the artwork, the gun he used to make the imprints with. As he had no official licence for this gun it was confiscated by the police and destroyed. Though unintended, the police action of removing the gun from the exhibition but leaving the brooches with the gun markings, contributed to the meaning of the work.<ref name="KYBERIA2005"/><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ornamentumgallery.com/gallery/photo.php?photo=719 |title=Pistol Saints Brooches (OrnamentumGallery.com) |author=Ornamentum Gallery |accessdate=2012-01-09 }}</ref>

===Mr Claw===

At art exhibitions the visitor usually is not allowed to touch the displayed objects, not even when they clearly have a functional background like an artistic chair or jewellery. Therefore Noten used a funfair machine he called ''Mr Claw'' to offer visitors the opportunity to actually touch works of art. ''Mr Claw'' contains plastic bubbles with small pieces of jewellery inside the visitor can attempt to grab by using the machine's remote-controlled grabber. As a special attraction Noten put a 1&nbsp;kg silver bar inside as well (unfortunately this item is too heavy to be lifted by the grabber). ''Mr Claw'' was used at the [[Stedelijk Museum|Stedelijk Museum Amsterdam]] ''Geel metalliek: Goud voor Robert Smit'' exhibition on contemporary jewellery in 2004, and at the ''Icon Experiment 2008'' exhibition in [[London]], [[UK]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.iconeye.com/news/news/icon-experiment-ted-noten |title=Icon Experiment 2008: Ted Noten (Iconeye.com, 2008) |author=Penelope Shaw |accessdate=2012-01-09 }}</ref>

===Unstaged===

At a 2004 exhibition at the Amsterdam art society ''Arti & Amicitiae'' Noten used an installation with an [[industrial robot]] to show his ''Paperheadring'' that contained a tiny paper hat cast in acrylic.<ref name="UNSTAGED"/> In the 2011 project ''[[Ted_Noten#Lady Killer Vol. 1|Lady Killer Vol. 1]]'' the concept of an automated jewellery box was further explored.

===Golden Piles===

In 2004, Noten collected a large amount of low-price earthenware crockery from a Dutch budget store. He arranged the crockery in piles, fixed the design and had it gold-plated as a contrast. These unique objects he called ''Golden Piles'' or ''Festive Table Centers''. ''Golden Pile 9'' (2004) is a stack of plates that is in the Rotterdam [[Museum Boijmans van Beuningen]] collection.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tednoten.com/work/portfolio/golden-pile-9 |title=Golden Pile 9 (Tednoten.com) | author=ATN |accessdate=2012-01-09 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tednoten.com/work/portfolio/golden-pile-14 |title=Golden Pile 14 (Tednoten.com) | author=ATN |accessdate=2012-01-09 }}</ref>

===Global Tactile Pieces Vol. II===

On Noten's 2004 trip from Tokyo to Amsterdam he purchased, found or swapped objects that he afterwards transformed into jewelry designs that represented cities he visited, experiences he had, and people he met. In total 16 different works, i.e. the Chinese city of ''[[Tianjin]]'' is represented by a necklace with a large red drill. The Mongolian city of ''[[Erenhot]]'' is represented by a pendant that is now in the [[Middlesbrough Institute of Modern Art]] collection.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tednoten.com/work/portfolio/global-tactile-pieces-ll-tokyoamsterdam |title=Global Tactile Pieces II Tokyo-Amsterdam (Tednoten.com, 2005) | author=ATN |accessdate=2012-01-09 }}</ref>

===St. James Cross Revisited===

In 2005, visitors to the [[National Museum of Ancient Art]] in [[Lisbon]], [[Portugal]], which houses ancient art treasures from around the world, would receive a special brooch Noten designed by using the emblem of the [[Order of Saint James of the Sword]], a famous [[Portugal|Portuguese]] [[Order of Chivalry]]. Then the visitors were invited to make a picture or portrait with the brooch in their hometown and place this image on a dedicated website. That way a special bond would be created between the worldwide visitors' community and the museum.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.stjamescrossrevisited.com |title=St. James Cross Revisited website |author=ATN |accessdate=2012-01-09 }}</ref>

===The Real Love Bracelet===

In 2005, Noten commented on [[Cartier S.A.|Cartier]]'s iconic ''[[Love bracelet (Cartier)|Love Bracelet]]'',<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.newcartierstore.com/Cartier-Love_4_1.htm |title=Cartier Love Bracelet (newcartierstore.com) |author=Cartier |accessdate=2012-01-09 }}</ref> that can only be unlocked by the partner, by producing ''The Real Love Bracelet'', a silver bracelet attached to a blown glass bubble with a pair of rings inside. That way the wearer always has a pair of rings handy and only needs to break the bubble when the right moment has arrived.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://objectsnotpaintings.blogspot.com/2009/07/glasswear-all-glass-jewelry-isnt.html |title=GlassWear: All Glass Jewelry Isn't Created Equally (Objects Not Paintings Blog, July 28, 2009) |author=Bella |accessdate=2012-01-09 }}</ref>

===Wedding Pills===

As an alternative to traditional wedding rings, Noten designed a pair of golden ''Wedding Pills'' (2007). These are micro-inscribed with the names of the couple and the date of their wedding, and are to be swallowed during the marriage ceremony. Later they can be recovered from their journey through the body, and reused as a recurring ritual to strengthen the couple's bond after a marriage crisis.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://designcrack.com/2007/04/wedding-pills-by-ted-noten/ |title=Wedding Pills by Ted Noten (Design Crack, April 20, 2007) | author=Design Crack |accessdate=2012-01-09 }}</ref>

===Be nice to a girl, buy her a ring===

In 2008 the city of Amsterdam started a project to improve [[De Wallen|the red light district]] in the old city centre. Noten participated with a [[Vending machine|street vending machine]] that sold red rings with a wide variety of designs for only <U+20AC>2.50. The rings were intended to be bought for the neighbourhood prostitutes by their clients. Noten called the project ''Be nice to a girl, buy her a ring'' and hoped it would improve the mutual respect between prostitutes and clients, and that it might even introduce a more romantic atmosphere in the red light district. Afterwards he offered the red rings, cased and numbered in a limited edition of 250 pieces, as true art objects for <U+20AC>310.00 each.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.atnsupermarket.com/component/virtuemart/?page=shop.product_details&flypage=flypage.tpl&product_id=31&category_id=1 |title=Be Nice To A Girl Buy Her A Ring (ATNsupermarket.com) | author=ATN |accessdate=2012-01-09 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.talkingjewellery.com/?p=2161 |title=A Talk With Ted Noten (talkingjewellery.com, May 21, 2010) | author=Margriet Sopers |accessdate=2012-01-09 }}</ref>

===Messin' around with Willy===

For the 2008 exhibition ''LINGAM - 121 contemporary fertility symbols'' artists, designers and jewellery makers from 24 countries were asked to create new lingam objects based on the ancient fertility symbol. Noten contributed with a series of porcelain dildos with miniature objects attached, i.e. a car pulling a caravan and a highway lamppost.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://ifitshipitshere.blogspot.com/2009/11/ted-notens-gives-us-willies-with-his.html |title=Ted Noten Gives Us The Willies With His Limited Edition Bone China Dildo (If It's Hip, It's Here, 11.07.2009) | author=Laura Sweet |accessdate=2012-01-09 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tednoten.com/work/portfolio/messin-around-with-willy |title=Messin' around with Willy (Tednoten.com, June 2008) | author=ATN |accessdate=2012-01-09 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.majkehusstege.nl/kunstenaars-2/kunstenaars-m-z/ted-noten/ |title=Ted Noten (majkehusstege.nl) | author=Galerie Majke H<U+00FC>sstege |accessdate=2012-01-09 }}</ref> A white porcelain dildo with miniature [[Delftware]] attached is priced at <U+20AC>3,000.00.<ref name="GRK"/>

===Periscope===

In 2008 ''Atelier Ted Noten'' provided the renovated Rotterdam [[Museum Boijmans Van Beuningen|art museum Boijmans van Beuningen]] with a multimedia installation. It consists of a golden mobile, called ''Periscope'', positioned in the museum's lobby. The museum's new entrance ticket is a letter that the visitor can use to display an image of an item from the museum's collection on one of the walls of the lobby. The letter changes daily, the text and images projected from ''Periscope'' change equally.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tednoten.com/work/projects/new-entrance-boijmans-van-beuningen |title=New entrance Boijmans van Beuningen (Tednoten.com, September 27, 2008) | author=ATN |accessdate=2012-01-09 }}</ref>

===TEDWALK===

On November 23, 2008, Noten was awarded with the ''Francoise van den Bosch'' award, an international prize for innovative jewellery makers, and he combined the award ceremony with a catwalk presentation of highlights from his work since 1995 for the opening of a solo-exhibition at the [[Stedelijk Museum 's-Hertogenbosch]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dezeen.com/2008/12/01/tedwalk-by-ted-noten/#more-21297 |title=TEDWALK 2008 (de zeen magazine, December 1, 2008) | author=Rose Etherington |accessdate=2012-01-09 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tednoten.com/work/projects/tedwalk-2008 |title=TEDWALK 2008 (Tednoten.com, November 23, 2008) | author=ATN |accessdate=2012-01-09 }}</ref>

===The Revenge of the Pearl Necklace===

In 2009, during the fashion exhibition ''Gejaagd door de wind'' (Gone with the wind) at the [[Zuiderzeemuseum]] in [[Enkhuizen]], Noten showed his work ''The Revenge of the Pearl Necklace'' consisting of the decomposing body of a pike that gradually exposed a pearl necklace Noten had put inside the stomach of the fish. Visitors were overwhelmed by the smell. Later during the exhibition Noten showed a video of the decomposing process together with the pike's cleaned skeleton and the necklace itself. With ''The Revenge'' Noten is referring to the Zuiderzee fishermen's loathing of pearls as these were very popular with the nobility.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://clementiene.blogspot.com/2010/01/revenge-of-pearl-necklace.html |title=The Revenge of the Pearl Necklace (Clementiene Blog, January 20, 2010) |author=Clementiene |accessdate=2012-01-09 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://vimeo.com/31735891 |title=Revenge Of The Pearl Necklace video (Vimeo.com video, 2010) |author=ATN |accessdate=2012-01-09 }}</ref>

===Haunted by 36 Women===

In 2009, Noten started, inspired by a card of Japanese artist [[Hokusai|Hokusai Katsushika]] (1760<U+2013>1849), his ongoing ''Haunted by 36 Women'' project. Like Hokusai who created 36 drawings from the mountain he loved, Noten chose 36 archetypes of women to design jewellery for. First, a life-size sculpture is constructed, which is then transformed into a wearable art object, made out of different materials like nylon, stainless steel, titanium, silver or gold.<ref name=TEDNOTENintro>{{cite web |url=http://dutchdesign.submarinechannel.com/?p=165 |title=Dutch Profiles: Ted Noten (Vimeo.com video, English subtitles, October 8, 2009) |author=DutchProfiles |accessdate=2012-01-09 }}</ref><ref name=HIP04162009>{{cite web |url=http://ifitshipitshere.blogspot.com/2009/04/inspired-by-hokusai-ted-noten-is.html |title=Inspired by Hokusai, Ted Noten Is Haunted By 36 Women (If It's Hip, It's Here, 4.16.2009) | author=Laura Sweet |accessdate=2012-01-09 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tednoten.com/work/portfolio/haunted-by-36-women |title=Haunted by 36 Women (Tednoten.com, September 2009) | author=ATN |accessdate=2012-01-09 }}</ref>

===Vertical Rainbow===

In 2010, ''Atelier Ted Noten'' participated in the exhibition ''Contemplating the Void'' that marked the 50th anniversary of the [[Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum|Guggenheim Museum]] in [[New York City]]. The museum asked for designs that would provide the visitor with an inspiring view of the large central [[Atrium (architecture)|atrium]] of the Guggenheim building. ATN suggested an installation design that made use of a sparkling curtain of [[Swarovski]] crystals falling from the ceiling. A special projector light on the crystals would then generate a vertical rainbow of colours across the atrium.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/19/arts/design/19void.html?pagewanted=all |title=Art Review: Contemplating the Void (''The New York Times'', February 18, 2010) |author=Roberta Smith |accessdate=2012-01-09 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.design.nl/item/contemplating_the_void |title=Contemplating the Void (Design.nl, February 17, 2010) |author=David Sokol |accessdate=2012-01-09 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.designboom.com/weblog/cat/8/view/8869/atelier-ted-noten-ever-seen-a-vertical-rainbow.html |title=Atelier Ted Noten: "Ever seen a vertical rainbow?"

===Three Stars Bomb !===

At first glance the ''Three Stars Bomb!'' looks like a classic bomb with long wick. But once ignited it appears to be a candle that gradually displays three bronze stars that can be worn as brooches (i.e. to imitate a [[three-star rank]]). Comes with the Swedish ''Three Stars Safety Matches'' that inspired Noten to make this design. Displayed during ''[[Milan Design Week| Milan Design Week 2010]]'' and now in the [[Centraal Museum| Centraal Museum Utrecht]] collection. Priced at <U+20AC>39.95.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.atnsupermarket.com/component/virtuemart/?page=shop.product_details&flypage=flypage.tpl&product_id=83&category_id=4 |title=Three Stars Bomb candle / brooch (tednoten.com) |author=ATN |accessdate=2012-01-09 }}</ref>

===The Temptation===

In 2010, Noten designed a life-size apple with a golden stem, topped with a small black diamond, called ''De Verleiding (The Temptation)''. The golden stem with diamond is in fact a brooch and the apple serves as a decorative stand for when the brooch is not worn. In a yellow and a black 3D-printed limited edition of ten pieces it is priced at <U+20AC>1,200.00.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.kunstkijkenkunstkopen.nl/kunstwerk/ted-noten/de-verleiding-zwart_1086/ |title=Ted Noten: De Verleiding/Zwart (Kunstkijkenkunstkopen.nl) | author=KK |accessdate=2012-01-09 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.kunstkijkenkunstkopen.nl/kunstwerk/ted-noten/de-verleiding-geel_1085/ |title=Ted Noten: De Verleiding/Geel (Kunstkijkenkunstkopen.nl) | author=KK |accessdate=2012-01-09 }}</ref>

===Wanna Swap Your Ring ?===

During the ''[[Tokyo Designers Week|Tokyo Design Week]]'' of September 2010 Noten participated in the exhibition ''Catalysis for Life - New Language of Dutch Art & Design'' at the [[Museum of Contemporary Art, Tokyo]] (MOT) in Japan. He arranged 500 of his ''Miss Piggy'' rings in the shape of his gun icon on a wall to offer the visitors an interactive art installation he called ''Wanna Swap Your Ring ?''. Many visitors then used the opportunity to swap their own ring for a Noten ring, leaving a genuine jungle of rings behind. Noten commented he did not know what to do with these visitors' rings yet but that he would surely find a purpose for them. Given the success he plans to use the ''Wanna Swap Your Ring'' installation at art exhibitions worldwide.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tednoten.com/work/projects/wanna-swap-your-ring-tokyo |title=Wanna Swap Your Ring ?

===SLOW - Eleven Women and 400 Daisies===

To celebrate the opening of the ''Mint Museum Uptown'', the [[Mint Museum|Mint Museum of Craft+Design]], [[Charlotte]], US, launched ''Project Ten Ten Ten'' on October 1, 2010. Ten innovative international artists in the fields of glass, jewelry, furniture and fiber art where commissioned, including Ted Noten, to create exclusive works for the permanent collection of the museum. Noten developed an interactive piece called ''SLOW - Eleven Women and 400 Daisies'' as an homage to the Mint Museum's Auxiliary women, as well as to all American women. SLOW consists of a golden buste, with the features of ten famous American women, that is completely covered with white 3D-printed nylon daisies. The daisies double as brooches and every new Auxiliary member will be given one to wear. That way it will take appr. 18 years before the entire buste is revealed (hence the title SLOW).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.freedomofcreation.com/for/ted-noten-designs-for-mint-museum |title=Ted Noten Designs For Mint Museum (freedomofcreation.com, January 20, 2011) | author=FOC |accessdate=2012-01-09 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mintmuseumauxiliary.org/about/acquisitions/ |title=SLOW Eleven Women and 400 Daisies (Mint Museum Auxiliary, Acquisitions 2010) | author=Mint Museum |accessdate=2012-01-09 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tednoten.com/work/projects/mint-museum-charlotte-usa-project-slow |title=Mint Museum, Charlotte USA, Project SLOW (Tednoten.com, October, 2010) | author=ATN |accessdate=2012-01-09 }}</ref>

===Pig Head Trophy===

Each year the [[Design Academy Eindhoven]] commissions an artist to design a trophy for the academy's graduates. For the 2010 edition Noten worked with Amsterdam-based 3D-printing company ''Freedom Of Creation (FOC)'' to create his ''Pig Head Trophy'', consisting of a sliced pig head with one slice per graduate. Not only was each and every slice different, they were also customized to show which course the student took.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.freedomofcreation.com/for/ted-noten-designs-graduation-trophy-for-design-academy |title=Ted Noten designs graduation trophy for Design Academy (freedomofcreation.com, October 13, 2010) |author=FOC |accessdate=2012-01-09 }}</ref>

===Dutch Fashion Awards===

In 2010 and 2011 ''Atelier Ted Noten'' teamed up with Amsterdam-based 3D-printing company ''Freedom Of Creation (FOC)'' to create the ''[[Dutch Fashion Awards]]''. These designs consist of 3D-printed necklaces that represent each of the six prize categories. Matching badges for jury officials were also made. Special attention was given to the ''Mercedes'' sponsored award that incorporates the ''Mercedes'' star. The 2010 awards are yellow, the 2011 are red.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.freedomofcreation.com/for/foc-sponsors-dutch-fashion-awards |title=FOC sponsors Dutch Fashion Awards (Freedomofcreation.com, November 15, 2010) |author=FOC |accessdate=2012-01-09 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.freedomofcreation.com/for/3d-printed-fashion-awards-2011-designed-by-foc-atn |title=3D Printed Fashion Awards 2011, designed by FOC & ATN (Freedomofcreation.com, November 11, 2011) |author=FOC |accessdate=2012-01-09 }}</ref>

===Art Rehab===

In 2011, Noten used the large taxi driver community of the UK industrial city of [[Middlesbrough]] to promote the exhibition ''The Modern Jewel - In time and the mind of others'' at MIMA, the [[Middlesbrough Institute of Modern Art]]. He thought of working with taxi drivers after seeing the landmark bridge in the area, the [[Middlesbrough Transporter Bridge]], that was celebrating its [[centenary]]. The transporter bridge operates very much like a ferry and during the lengthy crossing taxi drivers usually have nothing much else to do than to talk to their passenger(s).

Noten started the project with interviews, asking the taxi drivers how they felt about art, what they knew about MIMA and what they would like him, as an artist, to create for their cars. He received answers like 'I used to wear a ring for good luck', 'would like a girl on the hood', and 'I'm too busy for art'. These, sometimes puzzling, quotes were used on posters announcing the exhibition throughout the city.

Then Noten provided 300 taxi drivers with a little brooch and a slightly larger object, both the shape of a wing (referring to the godly messenger [[Hermes]]). The winged brooch was attached to the driver's jacket and the larger wing to the dashboard, functioning as a conversation piece to trigger the curiosity of customers. If the driver felt no inclination to talk about MIMA, he could use a CD to inform an inquisitive customer during the drive.

Finally, the taxi driver would provide the customer with a flyer about the exhibition with a [[Post-it note|Post-it sticker]] in the shape of a wing. The flyer invited the customer to write down their opinion of the exhibition on the sticker and paste it to a wall at MIMA. This wall eventually became an artwork itself, with the stickers positioned as feathers within the contours of a drawing of a large wing. The Hermes-flyers were also available at other places in town, such as waiting rooms of doctors, libraries, the town hall, etcetera. The flyer also entitled a visitor of the exhibition to a 40% discount on a winged Noten ring.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.behance.net/gallery/Art-Rehab-for-Atelier-Ted-Noten/2054548 |title=Art Rehab for Atelier Ted Noten (behance.net, 2011) |author=Maria Cichy |accessdate=2012-01-09 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tednoten.com/work/projects/art-rehab |title=Art Rehab (tednoten.com, 2011) |author=ATN |accessdate=2012-01-09 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.visitmima.com/education/projectdetail.php?id=121 |title=mini mima: Big Wing (visitmima.com, 2011) |author=mima |accessdate=2012-01-09 }}</ref>

===Lady Killer Vol. 1===

In 2011, ''Atelier Ted Noten'' and UK creative company ''Laikingland'' designed a modern day jewellery box called ''Lady Killer Vol. 1''. It is made by 3D printing techniques and comprises a robotic arm that grabs and presents a single piece of stored jewellery. The gold-plated ''Lady Killer'' ring designed for this project has on top a miniature gun with a white and a black diamond.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.laikingland.co.uk/lady-killer-17-w.asp |title=Lady Killer Vol.1 (Laikingland.co.uk, 2011) | author=Laikingland |accessdate=2012-01-09 }}</ref>

===''7 Necessities for a Woman''===

In 2011, Noten also designed a white ''[[Dior]] 001'' gun and a black ''[[Chanel]] 001'' gun with hand-tooled 18-karat gold details, as part of a larger series entitled ''7 Necessities for a Woman (to feel like a woman through the eyes of a man)''. The two 3D-printed nylon guns double as make-up bags with lip gloss and wand in the muzzle, the loading chamber serves as a pill compartment (complete with pills, including [[Viagra]]), 100&nbsp;grams of certified silver bullion in the Dior gun clip, 50&nbsp;grams of 24-karat gold in the Chanel, a toothpick and, in some models, a hairpin and a small vial of perfume. The guns also conceal a 4-gigabyte USB memory stick. Priced at US$11,500.00 (Dior gun) and over US$17,000.00 (Chanel gun) respectively.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/06/22/now-targeting-pistol-packin-mamas/ |title=Now Targeting: Pistol-Packin' Mamas (''The New York Times Style Magazine'', June 22, 2011) |author=Lynn Phillips |accessdate=2012-01-09 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://ifitshipitshere.blogspot.com/2011/08/killer-cosmetics-ted-noten-creates.html |title=Killer Cosmetics: Ted Noten Creates Feminine Firearms As Makeup Kits.

===Smartphone Jewels===

Noten developed his ''Smartphone Jewels'' project as part of the contemporary jewelry exhibition ''Unleashed!'' held at the Dutch ''Museum voor Moderne Kunst Arnhem (MMKA)'' in [[Arnhem]] from November 4, 2011 until February 6, 2012. The exhibition is advertised throughout the Arnhem city center with posters that each carry a different [[QR code|QR-tag]] to be scanned by a [[smartphone]]. Each tag provides the smartphone user with additional information on jewelry related topics, i.e. the price of gold or political commentary on [[blood diamond]]s or a story about miners. When all tags are scanned the smartphone user receives an individual code that can be exchanged for a 3D-printed Noten gunring at the exhibition.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mmkarnhem.nl/ENG/agenda/tentoonstellingen/ontketend-grenzeloze-sieraden |title=Unleashed!

==Monograph==
In 2006, [[Rotterdam]]-based ''010 publishers'' published Noten's 328-page [[monograph]] titled ''CH<sub>2</sub>=C(CH<sub>3</sub>)C(=O)CH<sub>3</sub><!--subscripts: see image athttp://www.010.nl/catalogue/book.php?id=556 --> enclosures and other TN's'' (ISBN 978 90 6450 555 3). The title refers to the chemical formula of the [[Poly(methyl methacrylate)|PMMA]] material, much used by Noten. Created out of a pile of thousands of photographs, combined with informational as well as poetic text, the book offers compositions, associations, and narratives to illustrate Noten's work. It achieved the ''Best Dutch Book Design 2006'' award.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.010.nl/catalogue/book.php?id=556 |title=CH2=C(CH3)C(=O)OCH3 enclosures and other TN's (010 publishers, January/February 2007) |author=010 publishers |accessdate=2012-01-09 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.grootens.nl/2/10/703/71.html |title=Monographs (Grootens.nl) |author=Joost Grootens |accessdate=2012-01-09 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.atnsupermarket.com/component/virtuemart/?page=shop.product_details&flypage=flypage.tpl&product_id=30&category_id=3 |title=Special Edition CH2=C(CH3)C(=O)OCH3 enclosures and other TN's (ATNsupermarket.com) |author=ATN |accessdate=2012-01-09 }}</ref>

==Documentaries==
In 2007, a half-hour radio interview was aired in which Noten discusses his monograph with ''Brett Littman'', the director of [[Drawing Center|The Drawing Center art museum]] in [[New York City]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://artonair.org/play/7979/show/edition-9-ted-noten |title=Material Culture Edition No 9: Ted Noten (ARTonAIR.org, 32:58 min, April 2, 2007) | author=Brett Littman |accessdate=2012-01-09 }}</ref>

In 2010, a one hour documentary film called ''Goud, Zweet & Parels'' (Gold, Sweat & Pearls) was produced by Dutch director ''Simone de Vries'' and broadcast on Dutch television.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK9CV2OdAEU |title=Ted Noten: Goud, Zweet & Parels Promo (YouTube.com video, 0:30 min, October 11, 2010) |author=hetuurvandewolfvideo |accessdate=2012-01-09 }}</ref> It portrays Ted Noten, his work and his philosophy:

{{Cquote2|''I make jewellery that takes some time getting used to. When you wear it, you make yourself vulnerable as it makes such a striking statement. I speak out through my jewellery and objects. I comment upon jewellery as a phenomenon, upon the industry or <U+2013> like any artist <U+2013> upon humanity.''| '''Ted Noten''' (1956) in 2010 documentary ''Goud, Zweet & Parels''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://vimeo.com/15866487 |title=Goud, Zweet & Parels (Vimeo.com video, 53:21 min, Dutch language, 2010) |author=Things Design |accessdate=2012-01-09 }}</ref>}}
