==Historical boundaries==
[[File: CA-53rd.png|thumb|left|<center>'''2003 - 2013'''</center>]]
From 2003 through 2013, the district was primarily coastal; it included western San Diego as well as [[Coronado, California|Coronado]] and [[Imperial Beach, California|Imperial Beach]]. After the 2010 census, the district was shifted eastward and lost its coastal focus, so that it now covers east central San Diego and eastern suburbs.
