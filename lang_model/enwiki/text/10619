==Plot==
[[Image:Homer and Mona.png|left|thumb|Homer and Mona in a flashback to the 1960s.]]
On a beautiful Saturday morning, [[Montgomery Burns|Mr. Burns]] has all of his employees [[Adopt a Highway|clean up a highway maintained by his company]] and Homer fakes his death so that he does not have to work. The next day, news of Homer's "death" spreads, and soon [[Marge Simpson|Marge]] orders Homer to go to the Springfield Hall of Records to get the whole "misunderstanding" sorted out. While sorting out the problem, Homer gets into an argument with a clerk who claims that Homer's mother is still alive, in spite of Homer's belief that she died while he was young. Homer decides to visit what he believes is her grave, only to discover that it belongs to [[Walt Whitman]]. Nearby, he sees his own grave and falls into it. A woman approaches and chastises Homer for falling into her son's grave. Homer begins to retort, but suddenly realizes that the woman is his mother, [[Mona Simpson (The Simpsons)|Mona Simpson]] and the two have an emotional reunion after 27 years apart.

Homer takes Mona home to meet the family, which causes quite a stir. She bonds with [[Lisa Simpson|Lisa]], being on the same intellectual level. While the two are sitting on the front steps, a [[police car]] drives by and Mona runs inside the house, making Lisa a little suspicious. She shares her suspicions with [[Bart Simpson|Bart]], who had raided Mona<U+2019>s purse and found several [[driver<U+2019>s license]]s with different names, causing Lisa to wonder whether Mona is a [[con artist]]. Meanwhile, Homer and Marge are wondering why his mother left him for 27 years and the two decide to confront Mona. The whole family questions Mona and she finally decides to explain why she left Homer.

In a flashback to the 1960s, Mona is a housewife who still lives with [[Abraham Simpson|Grampa]]. One night after putting Homer to bed, she becomes radicalized by [[Joe Namath]]'s long, flowing hair during the telecast of [[Super Bowl III]] and joins a group of [[hippie]]s who protest Mr. Burns's [[biological warfare|germ warfare]] laboratory. They detonate an "[[antibiotic]] bomb" inside the lab, killing all the germs and subsequently also curing lab security guard [[Clancy Wiggum]]'s [[asthma]]. Angry about the destruction of his "precious germs", Burns runs to the lab, but is trampled by the fleeing hippies. When Mona goes back to help him, not realising who he is, Burns manages to identify her as one of the perpetrators of the deed, forcing Mona to go into hiding. Upon hearing about these events, Homer wonders why Mona never sent any messages. Mona insists that she sent [[care package]]s every week, so she and Homer head to the [[post office]] to claim the undelivered packages. At the post office, Burns recognizes her and calls the [[FBI]], who send Bill Gannon and [[Joe Friday]] of ''[[Dragnet (series)|Dragnet]]'' fame.

The FBI and Burns manage to track Mona down through a cab driver, a [[gravedigger]] and [[Patty Bouvier|Patty]] and [[Selma Bouvier|Selma]]. They invade the Simpson home, but Homer and Mona manage to escape thanks to a tip-off from Wiggum, who is grateful to Mona for curing his asthma, and thereby allowing him to join the police force. 

Mona is once again forced to go into hiding and she and Homer say goodbye to each other. After Mona is driven away, Homer sits on his car and watches the stars.<ref name="bbc"/><ref name=officialsite/><ref name="book"/>

The idea for "Mother Simpson" was pitched by [[Richard Appel]], who was desperately trying to think of a story idea and decided that he had to really reach for an idea and decided to do something about Homer's mother, who previously had only been mentioned once.<ref name="Appel">{{cite video | people=Appel, Richard|date=2005|title=The Simpsons season 7 DVD commentary for the episode "Mother Simpson"| medium=DVD|publisher=20th Century Fox}}</ref> Many of the writers could not believe that an episode about Homer's mother had not previously been produced.<ref name="Oakley">{{cite video | people=Oakley, Bill|date=2005|title=The Simpsons season 7 DVD commentary for the episode "Mother Simpson"| medium=DVD|publisher=20th Century Fox}}</ref> Part of the fun of an episode about Homer's mother for the writers was that they were able to solve several little puzzles, such as where Lisa's intelligence came from.<ref name="Appel"/> The ending shot with Homer gazing at the sky was decided at the table read, but the drawing at the end was inserted by David Silverman because it was felt that the end was so touching that no other lines were needed. As a result, no promos were aired over the credits during the original airing of the episode.<ref name="Silverman"/> Bill Oakley has admitted that he always gets teary-eyed when he watches the ending.<ref name="Oakley"/>

Glenn Close, who was directed by Josh Weinstein,<ref name="Oakley"/> was convinced to do the episode partially because of [[James L. Brooks]].<ref name="Groening">{{cite video | people=Groening, Matt|date=2005|title=The Simpsons season 7 DVD commentary for the episode "Mother Simpson"| medium=DVD|publisher=20th Century Fox}}</ref> Mona Simpson was designed in a way so that she has little bit of Homer in her face, such as the shape of her upper lip and her nose.<ref name="Silverman">{{cite video | people=Silverman, David|date=2005|title=The Simpsons season 7 DVD commentary for the episode "Mother Simpson"| medium=DVD|publisher=20th Century Fox}}</ref> There were several design changes because the directors were trying to make her an attractive older and younger woman, but still be Simpson-esque.<ref name="Silverman"/> The inspiration for the character comes from [[Bernardine Dohrn]] of the [[Weatherman (organization)|Weather Underground]], although the writers acknowledge that several people fit her description.<ref name="Oakley"/> Mona Simpson's crime was intentionally the least violent crime the writers could think of, as she didn't harm anyone and was only caught because she came back to help Mr. Burns.<ref name="Oakley"/> The character was named after Richard Appel's wife at the time, the novelist [[Mona Simpson (novelist)|Mona Simpson]].<ref name="Appel"/> When Mona gets in the van, her voice is done by [[Pamela Hayden]] because Glenn Close could not say "d'oh!" properly<ref name="Oakley"/> and thus they used the original temp track recorded by Hayden.<ref name="Appel"/>

The design of [[Joe Friday]] is based on his design in "Dragged Net!", a parody of ''[[Dragnet (series)|Dragnet]]'' that was done in ''[[Mad Magazine]]'' in the 1950s.<ref name="Oakley"/> Mona becoming a radical after seeing [[Joe Namath]]'s sideburns is a parody of how many 60's movies have a sudden transformational moment and play music such as "[[Turn! Turn! Turn! (song)|Turn! Turn! Turn!]]"<ref name="Oakley"/> and there was much discussion among the writers as to what that moment should be.<ref name="Appel"/> The song originally intended to be taped over Mr. Burns<U+2019>s cassette of "[[Ride of the Valkyries]]" was "[[Wake Me Up Before You Go-Go]]", but it was too expensive to clear, so [[ABBA]]<U+2019>s "[[Waterloo (ABBA song)|Waterloo]]" was selected instead.<ref name="Oakley"/>

==Cultural references==
[[Image:FridayGannonMotherSimpson.png<U+200E>|thumb|Bill Gannon and [[Joe Friday]] of ''[[Dragnet (series)|Dragnet]]'' both appear in the episode.]]
"Mother Simpson" draws upon a number of references to 1960s popular culture. Three songs from the 1960s appear in this episode: "[[Sunshine of Your Love]]" by [[Cream (band)|Cream]], "[[Blowin' in the Wind]]" by [[Bob Dylan]] and the [[Jimi Hendrix]] cover of "[[All Along the Watchtower]]".<ref name="book">{{cite book|last=Richmond |first=Ray|coauthors=Antonia Coffman|title=[[The Simpsons: A Complete Guide to our Favorite Family]] |year=1997 |publisher=Harper Collins Publishers|isbn=0-00-638898-1}}</ref> Mona Simpson is seen reading [[Steal This Book]] by [[Abbie Hoffman]].<ref name="Oakley"/> Mona  mentions that she worked a number of jobs while on the run, including "marketing [[Jerry Rubin]]<U+2019>s line of diet shakes, proofreading [[Bobby Seale]]<U+2019>s cookbook, and running credit checks at [[Tom Hayden]]<U+2019>s [[Porsche]] dealership." Rubin, Seale and Hayden were three liberal radicals from the 1960s and Rubin did indeed have a line of diet shakes, and Bobby Seale did write some cookbooks. However, Tom Hayden never owned a Porsche dealership.<ref name="Weinstein"/>

The radicals use a [[Spiro Agnew]] alarm clock, which is based on a real item.<ref name="Weinstein"/> When Mr. Burns drives a tank towards the Simpson house, he is wearing oversized headgear. This is a reference to a public relations stunt by [[Michael Dukakis]] in 1988.<ref name="Weinstein">{{cite video | people=Weinstein, Josh|date=2005|title=The Simpsons season 7 DVD commentary for the episode "Mother Simpson"| medium=DVD|publisher=20th Century Fox}}</ref> When Mr. Burns plays a tape of "[[Ride of the Valkyries]]", it has been recorded over by Smithers with "[[Waterloo (ABBA song)|Waterloo]]" by [[ABBA]], a reference to Smithers' suspected homosexuality (ABBA have a large gay following) and to the helicopter beach attack scene in ''[[Apocalypse Now]]'', in which "Ride of the Valkyries" is famously played. [[Maggie Simpson|Maggie]] is shown dancing in her diaper and covered in slogans and it is a parody of the filler scenes of ''[[Rowan & Martin's Laugh-In|Laugh-In]]'' in which [[Goldie Hawn]] and other female castmembers like [[Ruth Buzzi]] and [[Jo Anne Worley]] danced in a [[bikini]] with slogans and drawings painted on their bodies.<ref name="Oakley"/> The two [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] agents are [[Joe Friday]] and Bill Gannon from ''[[Dragnet (series)|Dragnet]]''. Bill Gannon is voiced by [[Harry Morgan]], the man who played Gannon in the original series.<ref name="Oakley"/>

==Reception==
"Mother Simpson" is one of Oakley and Weinstein's favorite episodes and alongside "[[Bart Sells His Soul]]", they feel it is a perfect combination of real emotion, good jokes and an interesting story.<ref name="Weinstein"/> In 1996, "[[Treehouse of Horror VI]]" was submitted for the [[Emmy Award]] in the "[[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Animated Program (For Programming less than One Hour)|Outstanding Animated Program (For Programming less than One Hour)]]" category because it had a 3D animation sequence, which they felt would have given it the edge. ''[[Pinky & The Brain]]'' eventually went on to win. Bill Oakley feels that had this episode been submitted, it would have easily won.<ref name="Oakley"/> The joke about Homer apparently being familiar with [[Walt Whitman]] is one of [[David Silverman]]'s favorite jokes.<ref name="Silverman"/>

Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, the authors of the book ''I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide'' praised the episode, calling it "Gag-packed, and very touching".<ref>[http://www.bbc.co.uk/cult/simpsons/episodeguide/season7/page8.shtml]</ref> The Quindecim, a college newspaper, published a top 25 ''The Simpsons'' episodes list and placed "Mother Simpson" in 19th place.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://media.www.thequindecim.com/media/storage/paper618/news/2003/02/19/ArtsAndEntertainment/The-Simpsons.Top.25.Episodes-372979.shtml?sourcedomain=www.thequindecim.com&MIIHost=media.collegepublisher.com|title=The Simpsons' Top 25 Episodes|accessdate=2007-08-30|author=Culp, Sarah|date=2003-02-17|publisher=The Quindecim}}</ref> [[IGN|IGN.com]] ranked the Glenn Close's performance as the 25th best guest appearance in the show's history.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://uk.tv.ign.com/articles/730/730566p1.html|title=Top 25 Simpsons Guest Appearances|accessdate=2007-08-03|author=Goldman, Eric; Iverson, Dan; Zoromski, Brian|publisher=IGN}}</ref> In 2008, ''Entertainment Weekly'' named Close one of the 16 best ''Simpsons'' guest stars.<ref>{{cite news | title = Springfield of Dreams: 16 great 'Simpsons' guest stars | publisher = Entertainment Weekly | date = 2008-05-11| author=Wook Kim | url = http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20049408_3,00.html | accessdate =2008-05-11}}</ref>
