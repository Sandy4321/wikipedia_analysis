'''''Bad''''' is the seventh [[studio album]] by American recording artist [[Michael Jackson]]. The album was released on August 31, 1987<ref name="N.Y. Times, ''POP: MICHAEL JACKSON'S 'BAD,' FOLLOW-UP TO A BLOCKBUSTER''">[http://www.nytimes.com/1987/08/31/arts/pop-michael-jackson-s-bad-follow-up-to-a-blockbuster.html], New York Times, ''Pop: Michael Jackson's 'Bad,' Follow-Up to a Blockbuster"</ref> by [[Epic Records|Epic/CBS Records]], nearly five years after Jackson's previous studio album, ''[[Thriller (album)|Thriller]]'', which went on to become the [[List of best-selling albums worldwide|world's best-selling album]]. ''Bad'' itself has sold between 30 to 45 million copies worldwide, shipped 8 million units in the United States alone, and has been cited as [[List of best-selling albums worldwide|the fifth best selling album of all time]]. The album produced five Hot 100 number ones, the first album to do so. Similar to Jackson's previous music material, the album's music features elements of [[Contemporary R&B|R&B]], pop and rock.

''Bad'' was recorded during the first half of 1987. The lyrical themes on the record relate to paranoia, romance and [[self-improvement]]. ''Bad'' is widely regarded as having cemented Jackson's status as one of the most successful artists of the 1980s, as well as enhancing his solo career and being one of the best musical projects of his career. Nine of the eleven songs on ''Bad'' were released as singles; one was a promotional single and another was released outside of the United States and Canada. Five of the singles hit number one in the United States, while a sixth charted within the top-ten, and a seventh charted within the top-twenty on the [[Billboard Hot 100|Hot 100]]. The single that was released outside of the United States and Canada was commercially successful, charting within the top ten and top twenty in multiple territories. ''Bad'' peaked at number one in seven countries, as well as charting within the top twenty in other territories. The only song on the album which wasn't released as a single nor had a music video for was "Just Good Friends".

''Bad'' saw Jackson exercise even more artistic freedom than he did with his two previous [[Epic Records|Epic]] releases (''[[Off the Wall (album)|Off the Wall]]'' and ''Thriller''). On ''Bad'', Jackson composed nine of the album's eleven tracks and received co-producer credit for the entire album. The album continued Jackson's commercial success in the late 1980s and garnered six [[Grammy Award]] nominations, winning two. Aside from commercial success the album also received critical acclaim from contemporary critics. ''Bad'' was ranked number 43 in the ''100 Greatest Albums of All Time of the MTV Generation'' in 2009 by [[VH1]] and number 202 in ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine's [[500 Greatest Albums of All Time]]. The album marked the final collaboration between Jackson and producer [[Quincy Jones]]. In addition, Jackson scored five number ones from ''Bad'', making him the first of only two artists in the chart's history to amass five number-one singles from one album. This feat would not be equaled for 23 years when [[Katy Perry]] did the same with her album ''[[Teenage Dream (Katy Perry album)|Teenage Dream]]''.

Jackson wrote a reported sixty songs for the new album and recorded thirty, wanting to use them all on a three-disc set.<ref name="otherinfo"/> Jones had suggested that the album be cut down to a ten-track single LP.<ref name="otherinfo"/> When the album was released on CD, a bonus 11th track, "[[Leave Me Alone (song)|Leave Me Alone]]" was included.<ref name="linernotes"/> It was later released as a single.

==Composition==
{{Listen|filename=Michael Jackson - Bad.ogg|title=Bad (1987) |description=A 25-second sample of Jackson's "Bad" song where the chorus is played. The song's lyrics pertain to boasting, which was viewed by some music critics as Jackson referring to his stardom.}}
"[[Bad (Michael Jackson song)|Bad]]" was originally intended as a duet between Jackson and musician [[Prince (musician)|Prince]].<ref name="otherinfo"/> Other artists that were supposed to be featured on the album included [[Diana Ross]], [[Whitney Houston]], [[Aretha Franklin]] and [[Barbra Streisand]], but none of those collaborations ended up happening.<ref name="otherinfo"/> The album's song lyrics relate to romance and paranoia; paranoia was a recurring theme of Jackson's albums.<ref name="allmusicreview"/> [[Allmusic]] noted that ''Bad'' moved Jackson "deeper into hard rock, deeper into schmaltzy adult contemporary, deeper into hard dance <U+2013> essentially taking each portion of Thriller to an extreme, while increasing the quotient of immaculate studiocraft."<ref name="allmusicreview"/>

{{Listen|pos=left|filename=Michael Jackson - Dirty Diana.ogg|title=Dirty Diana|description=The lyrics to "Dirty Diana" pertain to a sexual predator, but unlike "Billie Jean", the sexual challenge is optional.<ref name=rollingstone/>|format=[[Ogg]]}}
"Dirty Diana" was viewed by critics as "misogynistic",<ref name="allmusicreview"/> and its lyrics, describing a sexual predator, do not aim for the "darkness" of "Billie Jean", instead sounding equally intrigued by and apprehensive of a sexual challenge, while having the opportunity to accept or resist it.<ref name=rollingstone/> "Leave Me Alone" was described as being a "paranoid anthem".<ref name="allmusicreview"/> "Man in the Mirror" was described as Jackson going "a step further" and offering "a straightforward [[homily]] of personal commitment", which can be seen in the lyrics, "I'm starting with the man in the mirror/I'm asking him to change his ways/And no message could have been any clearer/If you wanna make the world a better place/Take a look at yourself and then make a change."<ref name=rollingstone/> The lyrics to "Speed Demon" are about [[Speeding|driving fast]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.nytimes.com/1987/09/03/arts/critic-s-notebook-how-good-is-jackson-s-bad.html?n=Top%2fReference%2fTimes%20Topics%2fPeople%2fJ%2fJackson%2c%20Michael |title=Critic's Notebook; How Good Is Jackson's 'Bad'? |first=Jon |last=Pareles  |work=New York TImes |publisher=The New York Times Company |date=1987-09-03 |accessdate=2010-03-26}}</ref> "Bad" was viewed as a rived "Hit the Road, Jack" progression with lyrics that pertain to 'boasting'.<ref name=rollingstone/>

"Liberian Girl"'s lyrics were viewed as "glistening" with "gratitude" for the "existence of a loved one".<ref name=rollingstone/> "Smooth Criminal"'s recalled "the popcorn-chomping manner" of "Thriller".<ref name=rollingstone/> "Smooth Criminal" was thought of as an example of "Jackson's free-form language" that keeps people "aware that we are on the edge of several realities: the film, the dream it inspires, the waking world it illuminates".<ref name=rollingstone/> The music in "I Just Can't Stop Loving You", a duet with Siedah Garrett, consisted mainly of finger snaps and timpani.<ref name=rollingstone/> "Just Good Friends", a duet with Stevie Wonder, was viewed by critics as sounding good at the beginning of the song, ending with a "chin-bobbing cheerfulness".<ref name=rollingstone/> "The Way You Make Me Feel"'s music consisted of blues harmonies.<ref name="nytimesreview"/> The lyrics of "Another Part of Me" deal with being united, as "we".<ref name="nytimesreview"/>

''Bad'' was generally well received although some critics noted that ''Bad'' did not measure up to ''Thriller'''s success. [[Stephen Thomas Erlewine]], of [[Allmusic]], stated that Jackson "approached" ''Bad'' much the same way he approached ''Thriller'', which was to "take the basic formula of the predecessor, expand it slightly, and move it outward."<ref name="allmusicreview"/> Erlewine, who gave the album four and a half out of five stars, commented that while the album "rebounds with songs that prove mechanical can be tolerable if delivered with hooks and panache," it still made ''Bad'' feel like an artifact of its time instead a piece of music that transcends it."<ref name="allmusicreview">{{cite web |url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/bad-r10093 |title=Michael Jackson <U+2013> Bad |author=Stephen Thomas |last=Erlewine |publisher=[[Allmusic]].

===Notes===
Re-issues of ''Bad'' feature a number of changes when compared to the original 1987 release:

* "Bad" <U+2013> The original mix was replaced with the 7" single mix. The most notable difference is the lack of horns in all the choruses except for the last two. Horns are also missing from the second and third pre-choruses. The rhythm guitar during the choruses is also turned up along with the hi-hats.
* "The Way You Make Me Feel" <U+2013> The full-length remix used for the single with louder vocals and ad libs added to the end replaced the original album mix.
* "I Just Can't Stop Loving You" omits Michael Jackson's spoken intro.
* "Dirty Diana" is replaced with the single edit of the song.
* "Smooth Criminal" went through two changes on the album. It was remixed to make the kick drum heavier and the bass synth fatter. The quick-sequenced synclavier behind the bass has been rendered mono as well. The first version of this mix left the breathing intact, but was later removed after some time.
* "Leave Me Alone" wasn't included on the original vinyl release but was included on the CD release and now is included in all releases.
