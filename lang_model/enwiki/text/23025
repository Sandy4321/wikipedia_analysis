'''''Televis<U+00E3>o''''' ''(Television)'' is the second studio album released by [[Brazilian rock]] band [[Tit<U+00E3>s]]. It is the first album to feature [[Charles Gavin]] on [[Drum kit|drums]], after [[Andr<U+00E9> Jung]]'s departure. Unlike the previous album, the music of ''Televis<U+00E3>o'' is more pop-rock oriented. Criticizing songs like "Televis<U+00E3>o", "Pavimenta<U+00E7><U+00E3>o" and "Autonomia" may be seen as predecessors for the songs from Cabe<U+00E7>a Dinossauro, and these come along with pop songs about love such as "Pra Dizer Adeus" (whose later acoustic recording would be a big hit in Brazil), "Insens<U+00ED>vel" and "Sonho Com Voc<U+00EA>".

'''''Televis<U+00E3>o''''' is the second single by [[Tit<U+00E3>s]], released in 1985. The song criticizes [[television]], how it has dominated people's life and how it presumably reduces people's intelligence, as expressed in the lines "A televis<U+00E3>o me deixou burro, muito burro demais" (''Television made me dumb, too much dumb''). 

It would be later used as the credit music for [[Beyond Citizen Kane]].
