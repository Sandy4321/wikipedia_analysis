The '''Journal of Physical Chemistry A''' is a scientific journal which reports  [[research]] on the [[chemistry]] of [[molecules]] - including their dynamics, [[spectroscopy]], kinetics, structure, [[chemical bond|bonding]], and [[quantum chemistry]]. It is published weekly by the [[American Chemical Society]].

The most recent impact factor of the journal is 2.90 (2005).<ref>[[Journal Citation Reports]], 2006 </ref> In [[2004]], the journal received an [[impact factor]] of 2.639, which ranked it third out of 106 journals in the Physical Chemistry category.<ref>[[Journal Citation Reports]], 2005 </ref>

Prior to [[1997]] the title was simply '''Journal of Physical Chemistry'''. 
Owing to the ever-growing amount of research in the area, in [[1997]] the journal was split into [[Journal of Physical Chemistry A]] (molecular theoretical and experimental physical chemistry) and
[[Journal of Physical Chemistry B]] (solid state, soft matter, liquids,...).
Beginning in [[2007]], the latter underwent a further split, with [[Journal of Physical Chemistry C]] now being dedicated to the burgeoning fields of [[nanotechnology]], [[molecular electronics]], and related subjects.
