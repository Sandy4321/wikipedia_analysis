'''''The Tempest''''' is the tenth studio album by [[United States|American]] [[hip hop music|hip hop]] duo [[Insane Clown Posse]]. Released in 2007, the album marks the return of producer [[Mike E. Clark]], who had a falling-out with the duo in 2000. However, he did not collaborate directly with ICP, and would not do so until their 2009 album ''[[Bang! Pow! Boom!]]''

The album's [[concept album|concept]] compares a violent storm to a [[roller coaster]]; its lyrical themes vary from [[horrorcore]]-based character deconstructions and songs about the [[supernatural]] to [[humor]]ous and lighter subject matter. Clark's production was appraised by critics, and the album peaked at #20 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]].

== History ==

[[Mike E. Clark]] produced much of [[Insane Clown Posse]]'s discography, as well as working with other groups on [[Psychopathic Records]], until having a falling-out with ICP in 2000, after completing ICP's album's ''[[Bizaar]]'' and ''[[Bizzar]]'', and beginning production on the [[Dark Lotus]] debut album ''[[Tales from the Lotus Pod]]''.<ref name="Graham">{{cite news |first=Adam |last=Graham |title=Detroit producer Mike E.

After becoming a full time producer for [[Kid Rock]], Clark contracted [[pneumonia]], but ignored the illness, and began coughing severely as he awoke, leading to a three month stay in Mount Clemens General Hospital, during which one of his lungs collapsed three times.<ref name="Graham"/> As the result of his near-death experience, Clark decided to reconcile with Bruce and Utsler. Phone conversations between Clark and Insane Clown Posse led to Clark producing Utsler's 2006 solo album ''[[F.T.F.O.]]''.<ref name="Graham"/> The following year, Clark produced ''The Tempest''; however, in both instances, he did not work with Psychopathic Records directly.<ref name="Graham"/> Because of this, ICP felt that ''The Tempest'' was missing the collaborative element that they felt made their earlier albums enjoyable.<ref name="Graham"/> Clark would not work directly work with Psychopathic Records until 2009's ''[[Bang! Pow! Boom!]]''<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.psychopathicrecords.com/hatchetherald/081229/index.html |title=Hatchet Herald, Issue 4 |accessdate=1 January 2009 |date=December 29, 2008 |work= |publisher=[[Psychopathic Records]]}}</ref>

== Music and lyrics ==

Unlike previous Insane Clown Posse albums, ''The Tempest'' is not connected to the [[Dark Carnival (Insane Clown Posse)|Dark Carnival mythology]], which formed the basis for ICP's "Joker's Cards" series, which began in 1992 with ''[[Carnival of Carnage]]'' and concluded with the albums ''[[The Wraith: Shangri-La]]'' and ''[[Hell's Pit]]''; however, it references themes, concepts and songs from previous albums.<ref name=PopMatters/> [[Joseph Bruce]] (Violent J) said that ''The Tempest'' is a [[concept album]] in its own right.<ref name=NewsTimes>http://www.newstimes.com/news/article/Insane-Clown-Posse-Enjoying-the-ride-86661.php</ref> Bruce describes the album's concept as relating to both a violent storm which turns into a tornado and pulls people into a hurricane as well as a [[roller coaster]].<ref name=NewsTimes/> According to Bruce, "That's a lot like riding on a violent roller coaster, I'd assume. You get jerked to the left, jerked to the right, sucked way up into the sky, and then you go shooting down to the floor, and then you jerk up to the left and then you whip around to the right. Well, ''The Tempest'' is a storm in the form of a roller coaster."<ref name=NewsTimes/> As a result of this concept, the album focuses on a variety of different moods.<ref name=NewsTimes/>

''The Tempest'' maintains much of the [[horrorcore]] lyrical content ICP is known for, as well as their [[humor]]ous perspective.<ref name=PopMatters/> Unlike previous albums, this album does not contain any [[diss track|disses]] aimed at other rappers or music industry figures.<ref name=PopMatters/> Bruce and [[Joseph Utsler]] (Shaggy 2 Dope)'s [[rapping]] on this album is described by [[Allmusic]] reviewer David Jeffries as being delivered in "a carnival barker fashion that fits with their circus motif", and contrasted Bruce and Utsler themselves as being like "[[Alice Cooper]] with a mallrat attitude".<ref name=Allmusic/> 

The lyrics of "Growing Again", which describes Violent J growing into a [[giant]],<ref name=PopMatters/> were inspired by Bruce's weight gain; Bruce also says that the song reflects the feeling of being able to "rap about anything we want [...] I feel we have the right for some songs to be softer and not about killing or Dark Carnival."<ref name=NewsTimes/> "The Tower" describes a war veteran and expert marksman climbing a college tower and shooting people with an arsenal of weapons.<ref name=NewsTimes/>

[[Mike E. Clark]]'s production incorporates elements of [[rock music|rock]] and [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]], as well as [[live instrumentation]].<ref name=PopMatters/><ref name=Allmusic/> Reviewer Lana Cooper of [[PopMatters]] compares "Ride the Tempest" to [[Flock of Seagulls]], and describes the instrumentation as incorporating elements of synthesizers and calliope.<ref name=PopMatters/> Cooper says that "Growing Again" incorporates [[power ballad]] chords.<ref name=PopMatters/> Jeffries describes "I Do This!" as being influenced by [[psychedelia]], and called "Mexico City" "[[Lowrider|Low Rider]] music".<ref name=Allmusic/>
