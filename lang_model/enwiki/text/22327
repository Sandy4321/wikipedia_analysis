== Background ==
''Reality Killed The Video Star'' was Williams' first studio album in three years. In that period he worked with many producers, including [[Guy Chambers]], [[Candy Flip|Soul Mekanik]], [[Mark Ronson]],<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-1203297/Robbie-Williams-entertain-lined-Jacko-tour-dates.html|title=Robbie Williams back to entertain us as he is lined up to take over Jacko tour dates|accessdate=1 August 2009|publisher=Dailymail|date=31 July 2009 | location=London | first=Charlotte | last=Spratt}}</ref> and [[Trevor Horn]].<ref name="MTV">{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.it/news/news-detail.asp?idnews=26827&id=|title=Reality Killed The...Video Star! A ottobre il nuovo e attesissimo album di Robbie Williams!|accessdate=1 August 2009|language=Italian|publisher=MTV.it|date=24 July 2009}}</ref>
However, the British singer confirmed in August 2009 on his official website that the entire album was produced by Trevor Horn, and added that it was recorded in London.<ref name="realitykilledthevideostar.com">{{cite web|url=http://www.realitykilledthevideostar.com/new-album-out-november|title=Album produced by Trevor Horn and recorded in London|publisher=Reality Killed the Video Star website|accessdate=2009-08-16}}</ref>

Rumours of a new studio album co-written with Chambers had surfaced in early 2007, along with known commitments required by Williams to complete his [[EMI]] contract.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nme.com/news/robbie-williams/40241 |title=Robbie Williams ends album strike &#124; News |publisher=Nme.Com |date= |accessdate=2010-10-12}}</ref> British singer-songwriter [[Laura Critchley]] commented that she had sung vocals for three songs, and said that the LP would not be released until 2009.<ref>{{cite news |title=Three WAGs on Rob's bed |author=Dominik Lemanski |url=http://www.dailystar.co.uk/posts/view/16180/Three-WAGs-on-Rob-s-bed/|publisher=Daily Star |date=23 September 2007}}</ref>
At first it was believed that Williams had reunited with Chambers, but it was later confirmed that the song "Blasphemy" was co-written by the pair during the recording sessions of Williams' 2002 album ''[[Escapology (album)|Escapology]]''.<ref name="PopMattersInfo"/>

In February 2009, it was confirmed that Williams had written material with Soul Mekanik, Chambers and Ronson. The singer's spokesman, Tim Clark, said that the artist was planning to begin recording sessions in March and that the new album would be released in late 2009.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2009/jan/28/robbie-williams-album-mark-ronson|title=Robbie Williams's new album written with Mark Ronson and Guy Chambers|last=Michaels|first=Sean|date=28 January 2009|publisher=Guardian|accessdate=2009-08-01 | location=London}}</ref> The album was mostly written in Williams' home studio and was recorded in [[London]].<ref name=Albumnotes>{{cite album-notes|title=Reality Killed the Video Star|albumlink=Reality Killed the Video Star|bandname=Robbie Williams|year= 2009|notestitle=|url=|first=|last=|page=|format=CD booklet|publisher=EMI|publisherid=|location=London}}</ref> Amongst those who collaborated in the songwriting were Danny Spencer and Kelvin Andrews, Brandon Christy, Craig Russo, Richard Scott and Scott Ralph, [[Chaz Jankel|Chas Jankel]] and Fil Eisler.<ref name=Albumnotes /><ref>[http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/music/article6740077.ece RKTVS info], 23 May 2010</ref>

On his official website, Williams wrote that he was working with producer Trevor Horn on his new album; he described himself as "buzzing" and went on to call the album's sound "Very, very big". Williams revealed that the new album would be titled ''Reality Killed the Video Star'', a reference to the song "[[Video Killed the Radio Star]]" by Horn's former band [[The Buggles]].<ref name="MTV" /> The album was originally planned to be named ''Il Protagonista'' ([[Italian language|Italian]] for ''The Protagonist'') until Williams' management told him to change the title as it was "too pretentious".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.contactmusic.com/news.nsf/story/protagonista-robbie-williams_1121832 |title=Robbie Williams <U+2013> Protagonista Robbie Williams <U+2013> Contactmusic News |publisher=Contactmusic.com |date= |accessdate=2010-05-22}}</ref> In July 2009 Williams wrote on his official blog about the album: "My album's a killer: old Robbie, new Robbie and a Robbie that neither of us have met...".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.robbiewilliams.com/news-blogs/twattering-with-rob|title=Twattering With Rob....|last=Williams|first=Robbie|date=31 Jul 2009|publisher=[[Robbie Williams]] official blog|accessdate=2009-08-02}}</ref><ref name="mn"/> ''[[The A.V. Club]]'' has also reported that during 2007, Williams had recorded an unreleased [[Experimental music|experimental]] album that, he later said, would have amounted to "career suicide".<ref name="AVClub review"/>

Before the album's release, Williams spoke about his hopes for the album: "I want people to feel elated, I want them to dance, I want them to forget about who they are and where they are for 50 minutes <U+2013> and, within those 50 minutes of  forgetting who they are, I also hope people relate to the songs. This is a record that I<U+2019>m very proud of <U+2013> I think it<U+2019>s fucking brilliant. I want it to be the record that, if people think of Robbie Williams, they go, Yeah, ''Reality Killed the Video Star''." He also talked about his collaboration with producer Trevor Horn: "He<U+2019>s added something to the record that I haven<U+2019>t had on previous records <U+2013> his genius".<ref>[http://robbiewilliams.com/news-blogs/pre-order-reality-killed-the-video-star RW.com Reality Killed the Video Star pre-order], September 3, 2009</ref>

In the wake of [[Michael Jackson]]'s death on 25 June 2009, Williams was reported to have written and recorded a last minute tribute song to Jackson that would be included on the album.<ref name="mn">{{cite web|url=http://www.music-news.com/ShowNews.asp?nCID=0&H=Robbie-pens-tribute-song-for-Jackson&nItemID=28429|title=Robbie pens tribute song for Jackson |date=4 August 2009|publisher=music-news.com|accessdate=2009-08-05}}</ref> The track, "Morning Sun", was co-written by [[James Bond]] [[lyricist]] [[Don Black (lyricist)|Don Black]].<ref name="mn" /> During his ''[[BBC Electric Proms]]'' concert at [[The Roundhouse]] in London on October 20, 2009 Williams said about the song: "I thought it was about Michael Jackson [...] but it<U+2019>s actually about me again."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/music/live-music-reviews/6395048/Robbie-Williams-at-the-Roundhouse-review.html |title=Robbie Williams at the Roundhouse, review |publisher=Telegraph |date= 2009-10-21|accessdate=2009-10-22 | location=London | first=Neil | last=McCormick}}</ref>

== Musical style ==
The British singer-songwriter unveiled the album at an industry playback in London, where [[EMI]] [[United Kingdom|UK]] and [[Ireland]] president Andria Vidler hosted the event. Mark Sutherland from ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' said that the album "marks a return to Williams' trademark pop sound after 2006's more experimental <U+2013> and commercially under-performing <U+2013> ''[[Rudebox (album)|Rudebox]]''". Sutherland felt that even though the lead single '[[Bodies (Robbie Williams song)|Bodies]]', "features a refinement of the more electronic sound debuted on ''Rudebox'', much of the album returns to the fertile, adult pop ground of Williams' previous smash hit albums ''[[Escapology (album)|Escapology]]'' and ''[[Intensive Care (album)|Intensive Care]]''". He felt that the album highlights are the "lush ballads '[[Morning Sun (song)|Morning Sun]]' and '[[You Know Me (Robbie Williams song)|You Know Me]]', the intricate wordplay of 'Blasphemy' and the [[1980s]] sound of 'Last Days of Disco'", while also noting that "a confident-sounding Williams also experiments with some light [[psychedelic music|psychedelia]] on 'Deceptacon' and [[electronic dance music]] on the anthemic 'Starstruck' and 'Difficult for Weirdos'."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.biz/bbbiz/content_display/industry/e3i27b2ea26515fca079277636abf723f31# |title=Robbie Williams Unveils New Album |publisher=Billboard.biz |date=2009-09-08 |accessdate=2009-10-03}}</ref> Jude Rogers from [[The Quietus]] said that the song "Do You Mind?" "puts [[Status Quo]], [[Slade]] and a gallon of [[Glam rock|glam-rock]] in a bottle, shakes it up, and make an interesting, if rather peculiar, froth." Rogers said that on the track "Starstruck" "[[Goldfrapp]]'s ''[[Felt Mountain]]'', ''[[The Ipcress File (film)|The Ipcress File]]'' [[Soundtrack|soundtrack]] and the shadow of [[Broadcast (band)|Broadcast]] fall over the first ten seconds of this song about our obsession with celebrity". "Deceptacon" contains a "peculiar set of lyrics, floating on waves of reverb, sad [[String instrument|strings]] and icy [[Keyboard instrument|keyboards]]" Rogers said that "It's an unshowy meditation the shallowness of [[Celebrity|fame]], with a fantastic, mournful [[Conclusion (music)|outro]]."<ref name="TheQuietus"/> Mike Diver from [[BBC Music]] said that "Bodies" is "A strange brew of string flourishes, rumbling low end, oriental undertones and even an [[Enigma (musical project)|Enigma]]-style break into [[Gregorian chant|Gregorian]] territory", Diver also said that "Last Days of Disco" is "reminiscent of [[Eurythmics]]".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/music/reviews/92q4 |title=Music - Review of Robbie Williams - Reality Killed the Video Star |publisher=BBC |date= |accessdate=2010-11-03}}</ref>

''Reality Killed the Video Star'' received a varied response from music critics. One review aggregater, [[Metacritic]], gave it an average score of 64/100 based on its sample of 17 reviews.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/music/artists/williamsrobbie/realitykilledthevideostar |title=Reality Killed The Video Star reviews at |publisher=Metacritic.com |date=2009-11-17 |accessdate=2009-12-26}}</ref>
John Bush from [[Allmusic]] gave the album two stars out of five. He praised songs like "[[Bodies (Robbie Williams song)|Bodies]]" and "[[Morning Sun (song)|Morning Sun]]" but felt that many songs "sound rushed and the performances lackluster". He concluded that the album is "not decidedly worse than 2002's ''[[Escapology (album)|Escapology]]'', it's just bad in a different way. Whereas ''Escapology'' found Robbie disappearing into his own neuroses, this one is a hopeless m<U+00E9>lange of satire and sincerity where, from song to song, neither can immediately be distinguished."<ref name="Allmusic review">{{cite web|last=Bush |first=John |url=http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=10:dbfqxzqaldae |title=((( Reality Killed the Video Star > Overview ))) |publisher=allmusic |date=2009-11-10 |accessdate=2010-02-19}}</ref> Chris Mincher from ''[[The A.V. Club]]'' gave the album a ''C'' rating stating that: "Neurotically examining his personality quirks through decidedly unoriginal, un-quirky pop songs, Williams apparently wants to express his individuality with classic-rock reference points and frustratingly nonsensical novelty tracks."<ref name="AVClub review">{{cite web|last=Mincher |first=Chris |url=http://www.avclub.com/articles/robbie-williams-reality-killed-the-video-star,35682/ |title=Robbie Williams: Reality Killed The Video Star &#124; Music &#124; Review |publisher=The A.V.

Mark Sutherland from ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' gave the album a favorable review. He said that it offers "string-drenched ballads, slick [[George Michael]]-style [[Electronic music|electronic]] [[dance-pop]], [[Elvis Costello]]-esque clever [[Word play|wordplay]] and the slightly cheesy, supremely catchy [[Middle of the road (music)|MOR]] pop he made his name with." Sutherland said that "The end result may not be enough to convince America it's missing out, but expect this album to bring the already-converted back onboard in droves."<ref name="Billboard review">{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.biz/bbbiz/search/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1004050875 |title=Reality Killed the Video Star |publisher=Billboard.biz |date=2009-12-12 |accessdate=2010-02-19}}</ref> Dave Karger from ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' gave it a ''B+'' rating. Karger felt that, although the album "contains fewer knockout potential hits than past efforts", it does feature "the two strongest soul-flecked tracks of Williams' career", in "You Know Me" and "Won't Do That", and that the singer "simply sounds fantastic with a horn section".<ref name="EW review">{{cite web|author=Reviewed by Dave Karger |url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20319629,00.html |title=Reality Killed the Video Star &#124; Music |publisher=EW.com |date=2009-11-13 |accessdate=2010-02-19}}</ref>
Ben Hogwood from [[MusicOMH]] gave the album a mixed review, awarding it with three stars (out of five). He said that the "new songs reflect [a] safer maturity". Hogwood said that the album is "more like a [[big band]] version of George Michael's '[[Older / I Can't Make You Love Me|Older]]' than a [[funk]]ed-up '[[Faith (George Michael song)|Faith]]'" and that, although it has "a killer tune or two", the album is not exhibit the "same vitality of years ago." Talking about the production, he felt that "the [[Orchestration|orchestrations]] are layered on thickly in an attempt to bring some brightness to the grey." Hogwood concluded that Williams' "new found maturity suits his voice on one hand, but given his musical past it makes him a far safer proposition than he used to be."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.musicomh.com/albums/robbie-williams-6_1109.htm |title=Robbie Williams - Reality Killed The Video Star &#124; album reviews |publisher=musicOMH |date= |accessdate=2010-10-15}}</ref>

''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' music critic Ann Powers gave the album three stars (out of four) stating that the album is "bullishly diverse". She said that the album is "a full-body flex matching buttery ballads with laser-flecked dance tracks and arch updates from the music hall;". Powers felt that the songs "showcase the nasally soulful Williams as an irresistibly smart, cosmopolitan manchild of the overly wired world." Regarding the lyrics, Powers said that Williams "focuses hard on the out-of-body experience of the everyday." She said that the production on the album is "gorgeous" and that "Williams benefits greatly from the gifts of the producer's longtime team, including the arranger Anne Dudley."<ref name="LA Times review">{{cite news|date=November 9, 2009&nbsp;|&nbsp; 5:43 pm |url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/music_blog/2009/11/album-review-robbie-williams-reality-killed-the-video-star.html |title=Album review: Robbie Williams' 'Reality Killed the Video Star' &#124; Pop & Hiss &#124; Los Angeles Times |publisher=Latimesblogs.latimes.com |date=2009-11-09 |accessdate=2010-02-19}}</ref> Mikael Wood from ''[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]'' gave the album a 7/10 rating. He said that the album includes "cowbell-enhanced [[rave|rave-up]], a bit of [[Lady Gaga]]<U+2013>ish [[electropop|electro-pop]], and one track named after [[Transformers (film)|Transformers]]" and went on to call the record "a charm offensive with stars and stripes".<ref name="Spin review">{{cite web|author= Mikael Wood, ''[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]'' |url=http://www.spin.com/reviews/robbie-williams-reality-killed-video-star-virgin |title=Robbie Williams, 'Reality Killed the Video Star' (Virgin) &#124; Spin Magazine Online |publisher=Spin.com |date= |accessdate=2010-02-19}}</ref>

[[Slant Magazine]] music critic Jonathan Keefe gave the album a mixed review, rating it with two and a half stars (out of five) and talked about Williams' lack of success in the [[United States]], calling him "one of the U.S. pop market's biggest missed opportunities". Keefe felt that the album featured the sort of "heavy balladry and slick adult-pop" that made Williams' earlier records unappealing to American audiences and suggested that by "downplaying [his] formerly irrepressible charm", ''Reality Killed the Video Star'' doesn't do enough to reintroduce the singer to the U.S. pop market.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.slantmagazine.com/music/review/robbie-williams-reality-killed-the-video-star/1921 |title=Robbie Williams: Reality Killed the Video Star &#124; Music Review |publisher=Slant Magazine |date=2009-11-22 |accessdate=2010-04-19}}</ref>
Andy Gill of ''[[The Independent]]'' gave the album three stars out of five, commenting that "Williams' albums have increasingly come to focus upon the singer himself, which has consequently made them less and less appealing to those not entirely smitten with his charms."<ref name="Independent review">{{cite news|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/reviews/album-robbie-williams-reality-killed-the-video-star-emi-1815531.html |title=Album: Robbie Williams, Reality Killed the Video Star (EMI) <U+2013> Reviews, Music |publisher=The Independent |date= 2009-11-06|accessdate=2010-02-19 | location=London | first=Andy | last=Gill}}</ref> This sentiment was echoed by Rosie Swash from ''[[The Observer]]'' who also gave the album three stars out of five. She said that "''Reality Killed the Video Star'' is littered with references to his fall from grace, most of which hinge on the premise that someone or something else is truly responsible for his diminishing popularity." Swash said that "If there's a theme here it's not obvious, but it turns out Williams can be quite interesting when he moves off the topic of himself." Swash concluded that the album swings between "mawkish strings and piano overproduction" and "flashes of genuine pop frivolity".<ref name="Observer review">{{cite news|author=Rosie Swash |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2009/nov/01/robbie-williams-reality-killed-the-video-star |title=Robbie Williams: Reality Killed the Video Star &#124; Music &#124; The Observer |publisher=Guardian |date= 2009-11-01|accessdate=2010-02-19 | location=London}}</ref>
