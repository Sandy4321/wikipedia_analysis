'''Ellis Paul''' (born [[January 14]], [[1965]]) is an American singer-songwriter and [[folk music|folk]] musician.  Born '''Paul Plissey''' in [[Aroostook County]], [[Maine]], Paul is a chief architect of what has become known as the [[Boston]] school of [[songwriting]], a literate, provocative and urbanely romantic [[folk-pop]] style that helped ignite the folk revival of the [[1990s]].<ref>Alarik, Scott. Sound choice. ''Boston Globe'', [[April 24]], [[1998]].</ref> While remaining among the most [[pop music|pop]]-friendly of today's [[singer/songwriter|singer-songwriters]] with songs that have appeared in movies and on television, Paul has bridged the gulf between the modern folk sound and the [[populist]] traditions of [[Woody Guthrie]] and [[Pete Seeger]] more successfully than many of his songwriting peers.<ref name="websitebio">[http://www.ellispaul.com/index.php?page=bio Ellis Paul biography] EllisPaul.com.  Retrieved [[January 10]], [[2007]].</ref>

Having growing up in a small town in Maine, Paul attended Boston College on a track scholarship where he majored in English.  An athletic injury sustained during his junior year in high school changed the course of his professional career.<ref>Gerwetz, Daniel.  Passim hosts balladeer.  ''The Boston Herald'', Friday, [[February 19]], [[1993]].</ref> Paul picked up a guitar to pass the time while sidelined, and discovered that playing guitar and writing songs was the creative outlet he had been looking for.  After graduating from college he began playing at open mike nights in the Boston area while working with inner-city school children by day. Paul's growing popularity at Boston coffeehouses, coupled with winning a Boston Acoustic Underground songwriter competition and national exposure on a [[Windham Hill Records]] compilation combined to give him the confidence to resign his day-job and pursue a career as a professional musician.<ref>Wood, Arthur.

To date, Paul has released more than ten albums and has been the recipient of 13 [[Boston Music Awards]], considered by some to be a pinnacle of contemporary acoustic music success.<ref name="writerswrite">

==Growing up==  
[[Image:Ellis-piano.jpg|thumb|right|Paul performing "Home" on piano in [[Ogunquit, Maine]], the state in which he grew up. ([[August 5]], [[2006]])]]

Ellis Paul was born in [[Fort Kent]], [[Maine]], a small, rural potato-farming town near the [[Canada|Canadian]] border.  Paul<U+2019>s family had strong connections to the potato industry <U+2013> his father, Ed Plissey, was Executive Director of the Maine Potato Commission and his grandfather owned a 140-acre potato farm.  Schools in the area closed for three weeks each year so that school children could help with the potato harvest.  Paul spent many hours working on his grandfather<U+2019>s farm.<ref>Wood, Arthur.   Ellis Paul.  ''Kerrville Kronikle'', #8.  1996.</ref> 

While attending high school in [[Presque Isle, Maine]], Paul listened to [[Top 40 (radio format)|Top-40 radio]] and participated in [[Athletics (track and field)|track]].  He played [[trumpet]] in the school's stage band where he was introduced to the [[big band]] [[jazz]] music of [[Stan Kenton]] and [[Maynard Ferguson]].  He excelled in track, becoming the Maine State champion in [[5000 meters|five-kilometer distance running]], a feat that garnered several [[scholarship]] offers, including an offer from [[Boston College]].  Having graduated high school with the class of 1983, Paul relocated to [[Boston]], leaving small-town rural life behind.  In an interview with Daniel Gerwetz of the ''[[Boston Herald]]'' Paul stated, <U+201C>It wasn<U+2019>t until I went to Boston College on a track scholarship that I first heard folk.<U+201D><ref>Gerwetz, 1993.</ref>  Paul was particularly moved when he heard [[Bob Dylan]] singing "[[The House of the Rising Sun]]" from Dylan's ''[[The Times They Are A-Changin]]''' release.  It was then that he began to take folk music seriously.<ref> Stambler, Irwin and Stambler, Lyndon. ''Folk and Blues: The Encyclopedia.''  St. Martin's Press, 2001.  ISBN 0-312-20057-9.</ref>

==Early career: 1987-1990==
Paul majored in English at Boston College where he continued to participate in track. When a knee injury in his junior year sidelined him from athletics, Paul picked up an acoustic guitar to pass the time. He taught himself to play guitar with the help of a  ''Hits of the 70s'' songbook, and began to write songs.<ref>Gerwetz, 1993.</ref> Boston radio included a classic hits station that played the music of Bob Dylan, [[Joni Mitchell]], [[Neil Young]] and [[James Taylor]]; artists who were mostly unfamiliar to Paul. Within a few years they became major influences.  Having a career in music was the furthest thing from Paul's mind at that point, but as his playing and writing improved it became a bigger focus in his life. In an interview with ''FolkWax'' journalist Arthur Wood, Paul stated:

<blockquote>
"I started playing and learned a few songs by other writers to begin with.  I started writing originals within a few months.  My songs were pretty horrendous to begin with.  They kept getting better and better.  When I graduated, I started playing at open mikes in bars in Boston.  Eventually discovered that there were folk clubs where people were actually listening, and not drinking and carousing while you played.  I got involved in that circuit.  I think that<U+2019>s why I<U+2019>ve become so lyric conscious <U+2013> because of those listening rooms, where you really have to rely on words in those situations."<ref> Wood, 1996.</ref></blockquote>

The [[open mike]] circuit in the Boston area included The Nameless Coffeehouse in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts|Cambridge]], [[Westborough, Massachusetts|Westborough]]<U+2019>s Old Vienna Kaffeehouse and The Naked City Coffeehouse in [[Allston, Massachusetts|Allston]].  Paul became a regular face at those clubs along with other young folk musicians such as [[Shawn Colvin]], [[Patty Griffin]], [[Dar Williams]] and [[Vance Gilbert]].  In 1989 he won the Nameless Coffeehouse<U+2019>s New Songwriter Award.  Paul played Cambridge's [[Club Passim]], a venue that would become his "home" venue, for the first time when he opened for [[John Gorka]] in October 1989.  Less than four years later he performed his first shows at Passim as a headliner. The three consecutive nights of shows took place on February 19-21, 1993.<ref>Gewertz, 1993.</ref> 

It was at the Old Vienna that Paul met Jon Svetkey, Brian Doser and [[Jim Infantino]], all struggling young local musicians.  In 1989 the four young men formed a collective called "End Construction" and in 1990 released a compilation of songs titled ''Resume Speed: New Artist Compilation'' on the End Construction Productions label.  The four songwriters each performed four of his own original songs on the CD release.  The ''Resume Speed'' liner notes stated that End Construction Productions was a small independent production, promotion and recording company run by songwriters and musicians "hellbent on getting the good music out there."  In the interview with Wood, Paul stated that the four songwriters started doing group shows together and collaborated on each other's material. Although he goes on to say that the collaboration "was a good thing" and that the four musicians learned a lot from each other, eventually the foursome "burned out on the competitiveness."<ref> Wood, 1996.</ref>.  The collaboration lasted three years.<ref>Wood, Arthur. [http://www.visnat.com/entertainment/music/folkwax/mp3/bio.cfm?artistnumber=1368 "Maine native Paul now a national name in Folk music".] ''FolkWax E-zine''. Retrieved Feb. 17, 2007.</ref>   

Following his graduation from Boston College in 1987, Paul worked a day-job as a [[teacher]] and [[social worker]] with inner city school children performing at open mikes three or four nights a week.  It was not until the fall of 1992 that he quit his day-job to pursue music as a full-time career.  During this period Paul met his manager, Ralph Jaccodine, and together they founded Black Wolf Records.  In 1989 the label released Paul's first two albums of original material: ''Am I Home'' and ''Urban Folksongs'' and Paul began touring outside the Boston area.<ref>Barber, Mary. "Getting good mileage out of music: Ellis Paul's tour includes stop in Fort Atkinson". ''The Janesville Gazette'' (Wisconsin), April 8, 1993, p. 1C.</ref>  Although originally released on cassette, the two albums were re-released on CD in 2001.

==Rising success: 1990-2000==
Winning the Boston Acoustic Underground Award in 1991 resulted in Paul playing to the largest  crowd of his career to that point <U+2013> 300.   He continued to play in and around the New England area.   Around this time, Windham Hill Records, who had previously released the ''[[Legacy: A Collection of New Folk Music|Legacy]]'' songwriter compilation, put a call out to the music industry asking for songwriter submissions to be considered for the follow-up ''[[Legacy II: a collection of singer songwriters|Legacy II]]'' compilation.  After the Old Vienna Kaffeehouse sent one of Paul<U+2019>s tapes to Windham Hill, Paul's "Ashes to Dust" from ''Urban Folksongs'' was chosen to be on the compilation.  In the interview with Wood, Paul stated that he felt very excited to be on the Windham Hill release because it served as a calling card that every DJ and folk promoter in the country would recognize.<ref> Wood, 1996.</ref>  ''Legacy II'' was released in 1992 and included songs performed by [[Patty Larkin]], [[Patty Griffin]], [[Greg Brown]],[[Cheryl Wheeler]] and several others.  ''Legacy II'' was Paul<U+2019>s first national exposure. 

After Paul opened for [[Bill Morrissey]] a few times, Morrissey became one of Paul<U+2019>s earliest mentors.  Morrissey introduced Paul to the traditonal songwriting of [[Woody Guthrie]] and [[Mississippi John Hurt]], as well as songwriters of the 60s, such as [[Randy Newman]]. In a 2001 interview Scott Alarik, Morrissey said that Paul jumped into listening to traditonal songwriters "bigtime" and as a result is a much better writer and performer.<ref>Alarik, Scott.

([http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-81827659.html text] from highbeam.com with paid membership)</ref>
   
Paul asked Morrissey to produce his first album ''Say Something'', which was released in 1993 on Black Wolf records. The talents of fiddler [[Johnny Cunningham]] and guitarist Duke Levine, both friends of Morrissey<U+2019>s, can be heard on the recording along with the background vocals of Patty Griffin.  Levine would co-produce Paul<U+2019>s follow-up release ''Stories'', which was released on Black Wolf in 1994 and re-released on Rounder Records the following year. That year Paul was first invited to play the [[Kerrville Folk Festival]], winning the Kerrville New Folk award.<ref name=Kerrville Winners">[http://www.happenstance-music.com/KFF_History.asp Kerrville Folk Festival New Folk Finalist History] brought to you by Happenstance and Doug Coppock. Retrieved [[February 8]], [[2007]].</ref>

Paul became a strong follower of the music of [[Woody Guthrie]] during the early 1990s.  In a 1998 ''Boston Globe'' article, Paul refers to a tattoo of Woody Guthrie on his right shoulder saying that Woody's image was the only thing he could put on his body that would be "like a badge of who he was."<ref> Alarik, Scott.  Boston<U+2019>s "soul" man Ellis Paul crafts a trademark singer-songwriter sound. ''Boston Globe'', [[December 4]], [[1998]].</ref> Paul<U+2019>s tattoo of Woody Guthrie resulted in a chance meeting with Nora Guthrie, Woody Guthrie's daughter, at a Folk Alliance Conference when Nora asked to see Paul's tattoo.  That chance meeting resulted in Paul being invited to perform at a Woody Guthrie tribute show at the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] in Cleveland, Ohio.  The 10-day celebration, held in September 1996, included other notable musicians such as [[Bruce Springsteen]], [[Billy Bragg]], [[The Indigo Girls]] and [[Ani DiFranco]].<ref> Robicheau, Paul.  Ellis Paul<U+2019>s got Woody Guthrie under his skin.  ''Boston Globe'', [[September 20]], [[1996]].</ref>

Paul asked Jerry Marotta, a drummer who had worked with Peter Gabriel, to produce his third CD release ''A Carnival of Voices'' which was released on Rounder in 1996.  Marotta brought in bassist Tony Levin, guitarist Bill Dillon, and once again Duke Levine.  Paul stated that ''A Carnival of Voices'' comprised character sketches of different people in different towns tied to "the carnival mentality of traveling."<ref>Wood, 1996.</ref> ''A Carnival of Voices'' hit #3 on The CMJ New Music Report Triple chart and [[World Caf<U+00E9>]] voted it the #1 album of the year.<ref> Stambler and Stambler, 2001.</ref> By 1997 Paul's mailing list passed 7,000 names as his fan-base continued to grow.  
[[Image:Ellis-vance.jpg|thumb|right|Paul (left) with friend and fellow musician Vance Gilbert in [[Houston, Texas]]. ([[November 8]], [[2003]]) Paul's title track from ''Translucent Soul'' speaks of their friendship and deals with the issue of racism.]]
As Paul<U+2019>s reputation and popularity grew, he was regularly asked to return to folk venues and festivals around the country.  The number of shows he performed annually increased to more than 200.  Although Paul performed mostly self-penned songs, he would often include a Woody Guthrie song into his set.  Woody<U+2019>s "Hard Travelin'" was always a crowd pleaser, especially in Oklahoma, Woody<U+2019>s birthplace.  In July 1998, the 1st Woody Guthrie Folk Festival was held in Woody<U+2019>s hometown of [[Okemah, Oklahoma]].  Not only did Paul headline the festival along with Billy Bragg, but the city of Okemah made him an [[honorary citizen]].  Paul stated that when he made the pilgrimage to Okemah he felt that he was walking in Woody<U+2019>s footsteps and that the experience was "like going to the [[Mount of Olives|mount]]".<ref> Casey, Patrick. [http://ardmoreite.com/login.shtml?orq:http://ardmoreite.com/stories/072098/ent_guthrie.shtml "Singers participate in Guthrie festival."]  ''The Daily Ardmoreite''.  [[July 20]], [[1998]]. Retrieved [[February 10]], [[2007]]. (Free with registration.)</ref> Paul's sixth CD, ''Translucent Soul'', was released later that year in October.  Again produced by Jerry Marotta, the title track is a song about his relationship with good friend [[Vance Gilbert]] and tackles the issue of [[racism]]. 

The decade ended with a career highlight when Paul was invited to perform at Club Passim's 40th anniversary show.  The event took place on [[January 16]], [[1999]] at the [[Sanders Theater]] in Cambridge.  The four-hour sold-out concert also included [[Patty Larkin]], [[Joan Baez]], [[The Nields]], and others.  Joan Anderman, covering the event for the ''Boston Globe'', reported that Paul's "thinking-person's poetry" at the Sanders theater was "embellished with the bite of an electric guitarist and the earthy cool of a percussionist", and that his set was "a model of modern organic grace".<ref>Anderman, Joan.

Members of Paul's audiences are often treated to original poems.  Black Wolf Press  published ''Notes from the Road'', a collection of Paul's original poems, lyrics, journal entries and drawings in May 2002.  In her review for ''Performing Songwriter'', Abby White said, "The book has an intimate, conversational tone, and Paul's childlike drawings, song lyrics and poetry provide commerical breaks to his personal journal entries and vivid recollections of significant events he encounters while touring".<ref>White, Abby.

In 2002 Paul<U+2019>s friendship with Nora Guthrie resulted in one of the biggest highlights of his career.  Nora Guthrie is [[executive director]] of the Woody Guthrie Foundation and Archives in New York City where hundreds of Woody Guthrie<U+2019>s handwritten lyrics - many without music - are housed.  She invited Paul to visit the Archives and choose one set of lyrics to put to song.  Referring to the huge undertaking of finding songwriters to write music for hundreds of her father's lyrics, Nora Guthrie stated that there was a "job description" that her father left behind that "Ellis took on".<ref>Hubstuff Staff.

Paul<U+2019>s connection to Woody Guthrie continued into 2003 when he was invited to perform in the Ribbon of Highway, Endless Skyway tribute show to honor Woody Guthrie. The ensemble show, which was the brainchild of Texas singer-songwriter Jimmy LaFave, toured around the country and included a rotating cast of singer-songwriters individually performing Guthrie's songs. Interspersed between songs were Guthrie's philosophical writings read by a narrator.  In addition to LaFave and Paul, members of the rotating cast included [[Slaid Cleaves]], [[Eliza Gilkyson]], Joel Raphael, husband-wife duo Sarah Lee Guthrie (Woody Guthrie's granddaughter) and Johnny Irion, Michael Fracasso, and The Burns Sisters.

Paul's ''3000&nbsp;Miles'' [[DVD]] was released in February 2003. Divided into four segments, the DVD begins with a live show recorded on [[October 3]], [[2001]] at Boston's Somerville Theater - a show that was the final date of a six-week tour with [[Susan Werner]].  The second segment is a 39-minute road movie filmed in 1995 by Matt Linde, an independent filmmaker who accompanied Paul on a cross-country tour.  Individual vignettes chronicle shows, conversations and events in Paul's daily life as a traveling musician.  A third segment shows Paul demonstrating the [[open tuning]]s he uses in many of his songs, while the final segment is a discussion of songwriting with fellow songwriters Christopher Williams and Vance Gilbert.  In her review for ''[[Dirty Linen]]'', Annette C. Eshleman said, "In just under three hours, viewers are able to watch as Paul evolves from a young, inexperienced folk singer wearing a backwards baseball cap to the highly respected, confident, seasoned performer that he is today".<ref>Eshleman, Annette C. Ellis Paul. 3000 Miles. ''Dirty Linen'', August/September 2003, p. 102.</ref>   In September 2003 Paul released ''Side of the Road'', a duo album recorded with good friend Vance Gilbert.  The two songwriters, who have often shared the stage, each chose four cover songs to record - individual favorites - plus one song of their own.  Although the album did not start out as a "9/11" project, the inclusion of Mark Erelli<U+2019>s "The Only Way" set a theme.  A review in [[No Depression|''No Depression'']] magazine said this about Paul and Gilbert<U+2019>s choice of songs:

<blockquote>"Thematically they<U+2019>re mostly about individuals <U+2013> indeed, an entire planet <U+2013> in desperate need of healing.  To that end, Paul<U+2019>s original tune "Citizen of the World" is a wonderful balm, as he and Gilbert trade lyrics about the crossed bloodlines, attitudes and experiences that make us all brothers and sisters.  Their version of Van Morrison<U+2019>s "Comfort You" works magic of a similar sort." <ref>Durcholz, Daniel.  Ellis Paul and Vance Gilbert: Side of the Road.  ''No Depression.''  #48, Nov-Dec 2003, p. 147-8.</ref></blockquote>

==Career: 2004-present==
In 2004 Paul was awarded his 13th Boston Music Award in the category of Outstanding Singer/Songwriter.  At the time Paul was writing what he called "country tunes" when he teamed up with an Irish musician, producer, and studio expert named Flynn.  This resulted in ''American Jukebox Fables'', released [[April 5]], [[2005]], a recording produced by Flynn that surprised some fans by melding folk, pop and [[electronica]].  Paul said that his collaboration with Flynn formed a partnership where he brought banjos and accordions and Flynn brought a laptop and keyboard.  Although Paul knew that the end result would fall outside the comfort zone of some fans who expected another acoustic folk album, experimenting with Flynn's musical chemistry set injected excitement and fun into the recording project.<ref>Kocher, Chris.

For over ten years, Paul has annually played Club Passim on New Year's Eve.  In early 2006 Black Wolf Records released ''Live at Club Passim'', a recording compiled from his 2005 New Year's Eve shows.  In May 2006, Paul toured Europe and England for the first time playing to sold-out shows in [[Paris, France]]; [[Twickenham]], [[England]]; [[Cheltenham, England]] and [[Wasserburg]], [[Germany]].  The tour also included two BBC radio interviews and a radio interview in Paris.  Paul was included on the Woody Guthrie Coalition<U+2019>s DVD ''Woody Sez: a Tribute to Woody Guthrie'' released in 2006.  The tribute show, recorded July 13, 2005 at the Crystal Theater in [[Okemah, OK]], included Paul performing a duet with The Burns Sisters on <U+201C>God<U+2019>s Promise<U+201D>.  Also released in 2006 was Paul's "best of" album, released as ''Ellis Paul Essentials'', on [[October 10]].   The two-disk retrospective of Paul<U+2019>s 15-year career contained some songs that were absolutes and others that were included based on polls held on his [[website]] and [[discussion board]].  In his ''Folkwax'' review of Ellis Paul ''Essentials'', Arthur Wood stated: "If you've never visited "musically" with Mr. Ellis Paul, ''Essentials'' is a stunning place to start."<ref>Wood, Arthur. [http://www.visnat.com/entertainment/music/folkwax/mp3/album.cfm?reviewnumber=2014 "FolkWax Review of Ellis Paul Essentials: A Stunning Place."] ''FolkWax E-Zine''. [[October 26]], [[2006]].

When asked in a 2005 interview if he would rather play the Fleet Theater (19,600 seats) or the Somerville Theater (900 seats) <U+2013> both in Boston, Paul replied:

<blockquote>"I prefer to keep it intimate.  That way people can see the whites of your eyes.  I<U+2019>d love to write a hit song and have it on the radio like "American Pie" or something, but I<U+2019>m just gonna do what I do and take what I can and run with it, because it<U+2019>s a hard business to have even what I have.  So I don<U+2019>t have pie-in-the-sky Springsteen-esque hopes.  I just want to write great songs."<ref> Soroff, Jonathan.  Soroff on Ellis Paul.  ''Improper Bostonian.''  April 6-19, 2005, p. 16.</ref></blockquote>

Paul continues to be a hardworking musician on the folk circuit, playing close to 200 dates annually.  Paul's songs have appeared on more than 50 [[compilation CD]]s, and he has made nearly 40 guest appearances on the albums of artists including [[Lori McKenna]], [[David Wilcox (American musician)|David Wilcox]] and [[Mark Erelli]]. In her review of ''Ellis Paul Live'' for the Folk and Music Exchange, Roberta Schwartz said, "His finely honed songs tell stories filled with images that sparkle like jewels.  His is a poet's heart, and a romantic's soul.  He is an optimist who believes in people and possibilities."<ref name="FAMEreviewLive">Schwartz, Roberta.

==Songwriting==
"Boston-style" songwriting refers to the introspective and literate breed of singer-songwriter so prevalent in the modern folk music landscape.<ref> Alarik, [[December 4]], [[1998]].</ref> According to Paul, Boston-style songwriting grew out of Boston<U+2019>s thriving folk scene with its dense collection of colleges, college radio stations and listening rooms.  Boston radio includes the University of Massachusetts<U+2019> [[WUMB-FM|WUMB]], the country<U+2019>s foremost radio station for folk and acoustic music 24-hours a day.  Paul said the Boston songwriters tend to be more thoughtful and soft because in an intimate listening room, "all you<U+2019>ve got is you and your words."<ref>Conner, Thomas. [http://www.tulsaworld.com/ArchiveSearch/search/ArchiveArticle.asp?ArticleID=990714_En_d3wande "Wandering spirit: Ellis Paul hangs onto the essence of Woody Guthrie<U+2019>s music and ideals."]  ''Tulsa World'', [[July 14]], [[1999]]. Retrieved [[February 10]], [[2007]].</ref> Boston-style songwriting tends to be more about lyric than [[melody]], is intimate and thoughtful but also relevant, often addressing [[social issues]].  Boston-style songwriting does not only refer to Boston musicians, but includes national artists such as Shawn Colvin, John Gorka, Susan Werner, Bill Morrissey, and Dar Williams.<ref>Alarik, [[December 4]], [[1998]].</ref>

After graduating from Boston College, Paul worked as a case worker at an inner city school in Jamaica Plain, New York working with children with behavioral problems and also worked as a [[social worker]] in Boston with clients who were drug dealers, rapists, and other kinds of criminal offenders.  His work experiences opened his eyes to see the world in a broader, more open-minded way and provided material for the songs he was beginning to write.  Early in his career Paul promised himself that he would always write about the things he knew well.<ref> Stambler and Stambler, 2001.</ref>

In her 1993 review of Paul's ''Say Something'', Debbie Catalano wrote, "Ellis Paul draws a picture with his words then draws you into the world he's painting."<ref>Catalano, Debbie.  Ellis Paul: Say Something (review). ''New England Performer Magazine'', March 1993.</ref> Like a [[Norman Rockwell]] painting, Paul<U+2019>s songs are replete with crucial details and careful observations that tell a story with a minimum or words.  In a 2002 article, Thomas Connor dissected a verse from Paul<U+2019>s "Conversation with a Ghost" from ''Say Something''. "Instead of bluntly saying, "I ran into an old flame in [[Central Park]]," Paul writes around it, avoiding the clich<U+00E9>s, painting the picture, showing us everything -- the motives, the setting, the serendipity -- except what we expect."<ref> Conner, Thomas.

Retrieved [[February 10]], [[2007]].</ref>

When teaching songwriting classes, Paul often introduces aspiring songwriters to his "six-step program to effective songwriting" which is based on the premise that songwriters should show and not tell.  Paul teaches this six-step method to develop a character in a song:<p>

# Choose a name for the person.
# List five items in the person<U+2019>s bedroom.
# List five things the person would see if he or she looked in a mirror.
# Choose two colors that bring the person to mind.
# Choose one non-human metaphor describing the person.
# Write one line of dialogue that conveys the way the person speaks.<ref> Healy, 2004.</ref>

The most important advice he gives aspiring songwriters is to write what you know or what you<U+2019>ve experienced.  "Use reality as the springboard to whatever you<U+2019>re writing about," Paul said.<ref name="writerswrite">
Hughes, Troy. [http://www.writerswrite.com/journal/jun00/paul.htm A Conversation with Ellis Paul] for Writer's Write, June 2000. Retrieved [[January 13]], [[2007]].</ref> Paul also says that being a successful songwriter is like being a journalist who writes about what he sees and knows, the times people are living in and the things people are facing today.   "The journalist looks out the window and writes about what is really happening."  "I make sure it<U+2019>s real.  I don<U+2019>t want to fictionalize about things I haven<U+2019>t witnessed."

In her review for the Folk and Acoustic Music Exchange, Roberta Schwartz said, "Ellis Paul is one of the best singer/songwriters of his generation. And for many of us he is the face of contemporary folk music<U+2014>few are as smart, as literate and as poetic as Paul. He has spun his story songs for nearly twenty years now, and has eleven studio recordings (with an additional two early recordings on cassette<U+2014>now available on CD) to his credit. I cannot think of another artist on the acoustic music scene who is better-loved by fans, or more respected by his contemporaries."<ref name="FAMEreviewEssentials">Schwartz, Roberta.
