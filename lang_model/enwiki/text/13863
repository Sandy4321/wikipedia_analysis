'''Krill''' are [[shrimp]]-like marine [[invertebrate]] animals. These small [[crustacean]]s are important organisms of the [[zooplankton]], particularly<ref>[[Encarta]] Reference Library Premium 2005. Article &mdash; Krill.</ref> as food for [[baleen whale]]s, [[Manta ray|manta rays]], [[whale shark]]s, [[crabeater seal]]s and other [[pinniped|seals]], and a few seabird species that feed almost exclusively on them. Another name is '''euphausiids''', after their taxonomic [[Order (biology)|order]] '''Euphausiacea'''. The name ''krill'' comes from the [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]] word {{lang|no|''krill''}} meaning "young [[Spawn (biology)#Fry | fry]] of fish," which is also often attributed to other species of fish.

Krill occur in all oceans of the world. They are considered [[keystone species]] near the bottom of the [[food chain]] because they feed on [[phytoplankton]] and to a lesser extent [[zooplankton]], converting these into a form suitable for many larger animals for whom krill makes up the largest part of their diet. In the [[Southern Ocean]], one species, the [[Antarctic Krill]], ''[[Euphausia superba]]'', makes up a [[Biomass (ecology)|biomass]] of over 500 million [[tonne|ton]]s, roughly twice that of humans. Of this, over half is eaten by [[whale]]s, [[pinniped|seals]], [[penguin]]s, [[squid]] and [[fish]] each year, and is replaced by growth and reproduction. Most krill species display large daily vertical migrations, thus providing food for predators near the surface at night and in deeper waters during the day.

Commercial fishing of krill is done in the [[Southern Ocean]] and in the waters around [[Japan]]. The total global harvest amounts to 150,000<U+2013>200,000 [[Metric tonne|metric tonnes]] annually, most of this from the [[Scotia Sea]]. Most of the krill catch is used for [[aquaculture]] and [[aquarium]] feeds, as [[bait (luring substance)|bait]] in sport fishing, or in the pharmaceutical industry. In Japan and Russia, krill is also used for human consumption and is known as {{transl|ja|''okiami''}} ({{lang|ja|<U+30AA><U+30AD><U+30A2><U+30DF>}}){{ref|1}} in Japan.

== Taxonomy ==
The order ''Euphausiacea'' is split into two families. The family [[Bentheuphausiidae]] has only one species, ''[[Bentheuphausia amblyops]]'', a [[bathypelagic]] krill living in deep waters below {{convert|1000|m|ft|-1}}. It is considered the most primitive living species of all krill.<ref>Brinton, E.: ''The distribution of Pacific euphausiids.'', Bull. Scripps Inst. Oceanogr. '''8'''(2), pp. 51<U+2013>270; 1962.</ref> The other family, the [[Euphausiidae]], contains ten different [[Genus|genera]] with a total of 85 species. Of these, the genus ''[[Euphausia]]'' is the largest, with 31 species.<ref>[http://www.itis.usda.gov/servlet/SingleRpt/SingleRpt?search_topic = TSN&search_value = 95496 Taxonomy of ''Euphausiacea''] from [[ITIS]].</ref>

Well-known species<U+2014>mainly because they are subject to commercial [[krill fishery]]<U+2014>include [[Antarctic krill]] (''Euphausia superba''), [[Pacific krill]] (''Euphausia pacifica'') and [[Northern krill]] (''Meganyctiphanes norvegica'')

== Distribution ==
[[Image:Krill swarm.jpg|thumb|right|A krill swarm.]]
Krill occur worldwide in all oceans; most species have transoceanic distribution, and several species have [[endemic (ecology)|endemic]] or [[neritic]] restricted distribution. Species of the genus ''[[Thysanoessa]]'' occur in both the Atlantic and [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific]] oceans. The Pacific is home to ''[[Euphausia pacifica]]''. [[Northern krill]] occur across the Atlantic from the [[Mediterranean Sea]] northward. The four species of the genus ''[[Nyctiphanes]]'' are highly abundant along the [[upwelling]] regions of the California, Humbolt, Benguela, and Canarias [[Ocean current|current system]]s, the regions that are most heavily exploited by humans for fish, molluscs and crustaceans.

In the [[Antarctica|Antarctic]], seven species are known,<ref>Brueggeman, P.: ''[http://scilib.ucsd.edu/sio/nsf/fguide/arthropoda10.html Euphausia crystallorophias]'', from the [http://scilib.ucsd.edu/sio/nsf/fguide/ Underwater Field Guide to Ross Island & McMurdo Sound, Antarctica].</ref> one species of the genus ''Thysanoessa'' (''T. macrura'') and six of the genus ''Euphausia''. The [[Antarctic krill]] (''Euphausia superba'') commonly lives at depths of as much as {{convert|100|m|ft|-1|abbr=on}},<ref>[http://marinebio.org/species.asp?id = 518 Krill] at MarineBio.</ref> whereas [[Ice krill]] (''Euphausia crystallorophias'') have been recorded at a depth of {{convert|4000|m|ft|-2|abbr=on}}, though they commonly live at depths of at most 300 to 600 m (1,000&ndash;2,000&nbsp;ft).<ref>Kirkwood, J.A.: ''A Guide to the ''Euphausiacea'' of the Southern Ocean.''

== Anatomy and morphology ==
[[Image:Krillanatomykils.jpg|thumb|Krill anatomy explained, using ''[[Euphausia superba]]'' as a model]]
Krill are [[crustaceans]] and have a [[chitin]]ous [[exoskeleton]] made up of three segments: the cephalon (head), the thorax, and the [[abdomen]]. The first two segments are fused into one segment, the [[cephalothorax]]. This outer shell of krill is transparent in most species. Krill feature intricate [[compound eye]]s; some species can adapt to different lighting conditions through the use of screening [[pigment]]s.<ref>Gaten, E.: [http://www.le.ac.uk/biology/gat/krill.html ''Meganyctiphanes norvegica'']; accessed [[15 June]] [[2005]].</ref> They have two [[antenna (biology)|antennae]] and several pairs of thoracic legs called [[pereiopod]]s or [[thoracopod]]s, so named because they are attached to the thorax; their number varies among genera and species. These thoracic legs include the feeding legs and the grooming legs. Additionally all species have five swimming legs called [[pleopod]]s or "swimmerets", very similar to those of the common freshwater lobster. Most krill are about 1 to 2 cm (<U+215C>&ndash;<U+00BE>&nbsp;[[Inch|in]]) long as adults, a few species grow to sizes on the order of 6 to 15&nbsp;cm (2<U+00BC>&ndash;6&nbsp;in). The largest krill species is the [[mesopelagic]] ''[[Thysanopoda spinicauda]]''.<ref>Brinton, E.: Thysanopoda spinicauda'', a new bathypelagic giant euphausiid crustacean, with comparative notes on'' T. cornuta ''and'' T. egregia. J. Wash. Acad. Sci. 43, pp. 408<U+2013>412; 1953.</ref> Krill can be easily distinguished from other crustaceans such as true [[shrimp]]s by their externally visible [[gill]]s.

[[Image:Euphausia gills.jpg|left|thumb|The [[gill]]s of krill are externally visible.]]
Many krill are [[filter feeding|filter feeders]]: their frontmost extremities, the thoracopods, form very fine combs with which they can filter out their food from the water. These filters can be very fine indeed in those species (such as ''Euphausia spp.'') that feed primarily on [[phytoplankton]], in particular on [[diatom]]s, which are unicellular [[algae]]. However, it is believed that krill are mostly [[omnivorous]]. Some few species are [[carnivorous]], preying on small zooplankton and fish larvae.

Except for ''Bentheuphausia amblyops'', krill are [[Bioluminescence|bioluminescent]] animals having organs called [[photophore]]s that are able to emit light. The light is generated by an enzyme-catalyzed [[chemiluminescence]] reaction, wherein a [[luciferin]] (a kind of [[pigment]]) is activated by a [[luciferase]] [[enzyme]]. Studies indicate that the luciferin of many krill species is a [[fluorescence|fluorescent]] [[Polypyrrole|tetrapyrrole]] similar but not identical to [[dinoflagellate]] luciferin<ref>Shimomura, O.: ''[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd = Retrieve&db = PubMed&list_uids = 7676855&dopt = Abstract The roles of the two highly unstable components F and P involved in the bioluminescence of euphausiid shrimps]'', Jour. Biolumin. Chemilumin. '''10'''(2), pp. 91<U+2013>101, 1995.</ref> and that the krill probably do not produce this substance themselves but acquire it as part of their diet that contains dinoflagellates.<ref>Dunlap J. C.; Hastings, J. W.; Shimomura, O.: ''[http://www.pnas.org/cgi/reprint/77/3/1394 Crossreactivity between the Light-Emitting Systems of Distantly Related Organisms: Novel Type of Light-Emitting Compound]'', Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, '''77'''(3), pp. 1394<U+2013>1397, March 1980.</ref> Krill photophores are complex organs with lenses and focusing abilities, and they can be rotated by muscles.<ref>Herring, P. J.; Widder, E. A.: ''[http://www.isbc.unibo.it/Files/BC_PlanktonNekton.htm Bioluminescence in Plankton and Nekton]''; in Steele, J. H., Thorpe, S. A.; Turekian, K. K. (eds.): ''Encyclopedia of Ocean Science'', Vol. 1, pp. 308<U+2013>317. Academic Press, San Diego, 2001.</ref> The precise function of these organs is as yet unknown; they might have a purpose in [[mating]], social interaction or orientation. Some researchers (e.g., Lindsay & Latz<ref>Lindsay, S. M.; Latz, M. I.: ''Experimental Evidence for Luminescent Countershading by some Euphausiid Crustaceans'', Poster presented at the American Society of Limnology and Oceanography (ASLO) Aquatic Sciences Meeting, Santa Fe, 1999.</ref> and Johnsen<ref>Johnsen, S.: ''[http://www.biology.duke.edu/johnsenlab/pdfs/pubs/blcolor.pdf The Red and the Black: Bioluminescence and the Color of Animals in the Deep Sea]'', Integr. Comp. Biol. 45, pp. 234<U+2013>246, 2005.</ref>) have proposed that krill use the light as a form of counter-illumination [[camouflage]] to compensate their shadow against the ambient light from above to make themselves less visible to predators from below.<br clear="all" />

== Behaviour ==
Most krill are [[swarm]]ing animals; the size and density of such swarms vary greatly depending on the species and the region. Of ''Euphausia superba'', there have been reports of swarms of up to 10,000 to 30,000 individuals per cubic meter.<ref>Kils, U.; Marshall, P.: ''[http://wikisource.org/wiki/Author:Uwe_Kils/hempel/part1 Der Krill, wie er schwimmt und frisst&nbsp;<U+2014> neue Einsichten mit neuen Methoden]'' ("The Antarctic krill&nbsp;<U+2014> feeding and swimming performances&nbsp;<U+2014>  new insights with new methods").

ISBN 3-334-60950-2.</ref> Swarming is a defensive mechanism, confusing smaller predators that would like to pick out single individuals.

Krill typically follow a [[diurnal]] vertical migration. They spend the day at greater depths and rise during the night towards the surface. The deeper they go, the more they reduce their activity,<ref>Jaffe, J.S.; Ohmann, M. D.; De Robertis, A.: [http://jaffeweb.ucsd.edu/pubs/Sonar%20estimates%20of%20daytime%20activity%20levels%20of%20Euphausia%20pacifica%20in%20Saanich%20Inlet.pdf ''Sonar estimates of daytime activity levels of ''Euphausia pacifica'' in Saanich Inlet''], Can. J. Fish. Aquat. Sci. '''56''', pp. 2000<U+2013>2010; 1999.</ref> apparently to reduce encounters with predators and to conserve energy. Some species (e.g., ''Euphausia superba'', ''E. pacifica'', ''E. hanseni'', ''Pseudeuphausia latifrons'', and ''[[Thysanoessa spinifera]]'') also form surface swarms during the day for feeding and reproductive purposes even though such behaviour is dangerous because it makes them extremely vulnerable to predators.

[[Image:Pleopods euphausia superba.jpg|right|thumb|Beating [[pleopod]]s of a swimming [[Antarctic krill]]]]
Dense swarms may elicit a [[feeding frenzy]] among predators such as fish or birds, especially near the surface, where escape possibilities for the krill are limited. When disturbed, a swarm scatters, and some individuals have even been observed to [[ecdysis|moult]] instantaneously, leaving the [[exuvia]] behind as a decoy.<ref>Howard, D.: ''[http://oceanexplorer.noaa.gov/explorations/02quest/background/krill/krill.html Krill in Cordell Bank National Marine Sanctuary]'', [[NOAA]]. Last accessed [[June 15]] [[2005]].</ref>

Krill normally swim at pace of a few centimetres per second (0.2<U+2013>10 body lengths per second<ref name = "ign">Ignatyev, S. M.: ''[http://www.ibss.iuf.net/people/ignat/ikrill99.html Functional-Morphological Adaptations of the Krill to Active Swimming]'', Poster on the 2<small><sup>nd</sup></small> International Symposium on Krill, [[Santa Cruz, California]], USA; [[August 23]]<U+2013>[[27 August]] [[1999]].</ref>), using their swimmerets for propulsion. Their larger migrations are subject to the currents in the ocean. When in danger, they show an [[escape reaction]] called [[Caridoid escape reaction|lobstering]]&mdash;flicking their caudal structures, the [[telson]] and the [[uropod]]s, they move backwards through the water relatively quickly, achieving speeds in the range of 10 to 27 body lengths per second,<ref name = "ign" /> which for large krill such as ''E. superba'' means around {{convert|0.8|m/s|ft/s|0|abbr=on}}.<ref>Kils, U.: [http://wikisource.org/wiki/Author:Uwe_Kils/biomass3/part1 ''Swimming behavior, Swimming Performance and Energy Balance of Antarctic Krill ''Euphausia superba''.''] BIOMASS Scientific Series 3, BIOMASS Research Series, 1<U+2013>122; 1982.</ref> Their swimming performance has led many researchers to classify adult krill as [[nekton|micro-nektonic]] lifeforms, i.e., small animals capable of individual motion against (weak) currents.

== Ecology and life history ==
[[Image:Coccolithophore bloom.jpg|thumb|[[NASA]] [[SeaWiFS]] satellite image of the large phytoplankton [[algal bloom|bloom]] in the [[Bering Sea]] in 1998]]
Krill are an important element of the [[food chain]]. [[Antarctic krill]] feed directly on [[phytoplankton]], converting the [[primary production]] energy into a form suitable for consumption by larger animals that cannot feed directly on the minuscule algae. Some species like the Northern krill have a relatively small filtering basket and actively hunt for [[copepod]]s and larger [[zooplankton]]. Many animals feed on krill, ranging from smaller animals like [[fish]] or [[penguins]] to larger ones like [[pinniped|seal]]s and even [[baleen whales]].

Disturbances of an [[ecosystem]] resulting in a decline in the krill population can have far-reaching effects. During a [[coccolithophore]] bloom in the [[Bering Sea]] in 1998,<ref>Weier, J.: ''[http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/Study/Coccoliths/bering_sea.html Changing Currents color the Bering Sea a new shade of Blue]'', [[NOAA]] Earth Observatory, 1999. Last accessed [[June 15]] [[2005]].</ref> for instance, the [[diatom]] concentration dropped in the affected area. Krill cannot feed on the smaller coccolithophores, and consequently the krill population (mainly ''E. pacifica'') in that region declined sharply. This in turn affected other species:  The [[shearwater]] population dropped, and the incident was even thought to have been a reason for [[salmon]] not returning to the rivers of western [[Alaska]] that season.<ref>Brodeur, R.D.; Kruse, G.H.; ''et al.'': ''Draft Report of the FOCI International Workshop on Recent Conditions in the Bering Sea'', pp. 22<U+2013>26; [[NOAA]] 1998.</ref>

Other factors besides predation and food availability can influence the mortality rate in krill populations. There are several single-celled [[endoparasitoid]]ic [[ciliate]]s of the genus ''[[Collinia]]'' that can infect different species of krill and cause massive decline in affected populations. Such diseases have been reported for ''Thysanoessa inermis'' in the Bering Sea and also for ''E. pacifica'', ''Thysanoessa spinifera'', and ''T. gregaria'' off the North American Pacific coast.<ref>Roach, J.: ''[http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2003/07/0717_030717_krillkiller.html Scientists Discover Mystery Krill Killer]'', [[National Geographic]] News, [[July 17]] [[2003]].

It attaches itself to the eyestalk of the animal and sucks blood from its head; it is believed that it inhibits the [[reproduction]] of its host, as none of the afflicted animals found reached maturity.<ref>Shields, J.D.; G<U+00F3>mez-Guti<U+00E9>rrez, J.: [http://www.geocities.com/CollegePark/Grounds/6882/dajidae.html Oculophryxus bicaulis'', a new genus and species of dajid isopod parasitic on the euphausiid ''Stylocheiron affine'' Hansen''], Int'l J. for Parasitology '''26'''(3), pp. 261<U+2013>268; 1996.</ref>

=== Life history ===
[[Image:Nauplius Hatching.jpg|thumb|A [[nauplius (larva)|nauplius]] of ''[[Euphausia pacifica]]'' hatching, emerging backwards from the egg]]
The general life cycle of krill has been the subject of several studies (e.g., Guerny 1942<ref>Gurney, R.: ''Larvae of decapod crustacea.'' Royal Society Publ. 129; London 1942.</ref> and Mauchline & Fisher 1969<ref>Mauchline, J.; Fisher, L.R.: ''The biology of euphausiids.'' Adv. Mar. Biol. 7; 1969.</ref>) performed on a variety of species and is thus relatively well understood, although there are minor variations in detail from species to species. After krill hatch from the egg, they go through several larval stages called the ''[[nauplius (larva)|nauplius]]'', ''[[pseudometanauplius]]'', ''[[metanauplius]]'', ''[[calyptopsis]]'', and ''[[furcilia]]'' stages, each of which is sub-divided into several sub-stages. The pseudometanauplius stage is exclusive to species that lay their eggs within an ovigerous sac, so-called "sac-spawners". The larvae grow and [[ecdysis|molt]] multiple times as they develop, shedding their rigid exoskeleton whenever it becomes too small and growing a new one. Smaller animals moult more frequently than larger ones. Up through the metanauplius stage, the larvae are nourished by [[yolk]] reserves within their body. Only by the calyptopsis stages has [[cellular differentiation|differentiation]] progressed far enough for them to develop a mouth and a digestive tract, and they begin to feed upon [[phytoplankton]]. By that time, the larvae must have reached the [[photic zone]], the upper layers of the ocean where algae flourish, for their yolk reserves are exhausted by then and they would starve otherwise. During the furcilia stages, segments with pairs of swimmerets are added, beginning at the frontmost segments. Each new pair becomes functional only at the next moult. The number of segments added during any one of the furcilia stages may vary even within one species depending on environmental conditions.<ref>Knight, M. D.: [http://www.calcofi.org/newhome/publications/CalCOFI_Reports/v25/pdfs/Vol_25_Knight.pdf ''Variation in Larval Morphogenesis within the Southern California Bight Population of ''Euphausia pacifica'' from Winter through Summer, 1977<U+2013>1978''], CalCOFI Report Vol. XXV, 1984.</ref> After the final furcilia stage, the krill emerges in a shape similar to an adult, but it is still immature. 

During the mating season, which varies depending on the species and the climate, the male deposits a [[spermatophore|sperm sack]] at the genital opening (named ''thelycum'') of the female. The females can carry several thousand eggs in their [[ovary]], which may then account for as much as one third of the animal's body mass.<ref>Ross, R. M.; Quetin, L. B.: ''How Productive are Antarctic Krill?'' Bioscience 36, pp. 264<U+2013>269; 1986.</ref> Krill can have multiple broods in one season, with interbrood periods on the order of days.[[Image:Nematoscelis difficilis female.jpg|thumb|The head of a female krill of the sac-spawning species ''[[Nematoscelis difficilis]]'' with her brood sac.

These species generally hatch in the nauplius 1 stage, but recently have been discovered to hatch sometimes as metanauplius or even as calyptopis stages.<ref>G<U+00F3>mez-Guti<U+00E9>rrez, J.: ''[http://plankt.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/abstract/24/12/1265 Hatching mechanism and delayed hatching of the eggs of three broadcast spawning euphausiid species under laboratory conditions]'', J. of Plankton Research '''24'''(12), pp. 1265<U+2013>1276, 2002. Has many images of the earliest development stages of krill.</ref> The remaining 29 species of the other genera are "sac spawners", where the female carries the eggs with her, attached to the rearmost pairs of thoracopods until they hatch as metanauplii, although some species like ''Nematoscelis difficilis'' may hatch as nauplius or pseudometanauplius.<ref>Brinton, E.; Ohman, M. D.; Townsend, A. W.; Knight, M. D.; Bridgeman, A.

ISBN 3-540-14673-3.</ref>

Some high-[[latitude]] species of krill can live for more than six years (e.g., ''Euphausia superba''); others, such as the as mid-latitude species ''Euphausia pacifica'', live only for two years.<ref name = "nicol" /> Subtropical or [[tropic]]al species' longevity is still shorter, e.g., ''Nyctiphanes simplex'', that usually lives only for six to eight months.<ref>G<U+00F3>mez-Guti<U+00E9>rrez, J.: [http://www.geocities.com/jgomez64/euphausiids.html Euphausiids]; accessed [[16 June]] [[2005]].</ref>

Moulting occurs whenever the animal outgrows its rigid exoskeleton. Young animals, growing faster, moult more often than older and larger ones. The frequency of molting varies widely from species to species and is, even within one species, subject to many external factors such as the latitude, the water temperature, and the availability of food. The subtropical species ''Nyctiphanes simplex'', for instance, has an overall inter-moult period in the range of two to seven days:  Larvae moult on the average every four days, while juveniles and adults do so on average every six days. For ''E. superba'' in the Antarctic sea, inter-moult periods ranging between 9 and 28 days depending on the temperature between <U+2212>1 and 4 <U+00B0>C (30 to 39 <U+00B0>F) have been observed, and for ''Meganyctiphanes norvegica'' in the North Sea the inter-moult periods range also from 9 and 28 days but at temperatures between 2.5 and 15 <U+00B0>C (36.5 to 59 <U+00B0>F).<ref>Buchholz, F.: [http://taylorandfrancis.metapress.com/link.asp?id = w7capjjptvm7ebtx ''Experiments on the physiology of Southern and Northern krill, ''Euphausia superba'' and ''Meganyctiphanes norvegica'', with emphasis on moult and growth&nbsp;&mdash; a review''], Marine and Freshwater Behaviour and Physiology '''36'''(4), pp. 229<U+2013>247, 2003.</ref> ''E. superba'' is known to be able to reduce its body size when there is not enough food available, moulting also when its exoskeleton becomes too large.<ref>Hyoung-Chul Shin; Nicol, S.: [http://www.int-res.com/abstracts/meps/v239/p157-167/ ''Using the relationship between eye diameter and body length to detect the effects of long-term starvation on Antarctic krill ''Euphausia superba''.''] Mar Ecol Progress Series (MEPS) 239:157<U+2013>167; 2002.</ref> Similar shrinkage has also been observed for ''E. pacifica'', a species occurring in the [[Pacific Ocean]] from polar to temperate zones, as an adaptation to abnormally high water temperatures.

{{main|Krill fishery}}
[[Image:Krillmeatkils.jpg|thumb|Deep frozen plates of [[Antarctic krill]] for use as animal feed and raw material for cooking]]
Krill has been harvested as a food source for humans (''okiami'') and domesticated animals since the 19th century, in [[Japan]] maybe even earlier. Large-scale [[fishing]] developed only in the late 1960s and early 1970s, and now occurs only in [[Antarctic]] waters and in the seas around [[Japan]]. Historically, the largest [[krill fishery]] nations were Japan and the [[Soviet Union]], or, after the latter's dissolution, [[Russia]] and [[Ukraine]]. A peak in krill harvest had been reached in 1983 with more than {{convert|528000|MT|lk=on}} in the [[Southern Ocean]] alone (of which the Soviet Union produced 93%). In 1993, two events led to a drastic decline in krill production:  First, Russia abandoned its operations, and second, the Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources ([[CCAMLR]]) defined maximum catch quotas for a [[Sustainable fisheries|sustainable]] exploitation of Antarctic krill. In 2007, the nation taking the largest krill harvest in the Antarctic is Japan, followed by [[South Korea]], Ukraine, and [[Poland]].<ref name = "nicol" /> The annual catch in Antarctic waters seems to have stabilized around {{convert|100000|MT}} of krill, which is roughly one fiftieth of the CCAMLR catch quota.<ref>[[CCAMLR]]: [http://www.ccamlr.org/pu/E/sc/fish-monit/hs-krill.htm ''Harvested species: Krill (''Eupausia superba'')'']. Accessed [[June 20]] [[2005]].</ref> The main limiting factor is probably the high cost associated with Antarctic operations, although there are some political and legal issues as well.<ref>''See'' Wright, M.: "The Ownership of Antarctica, its Living and Mineral Resources, ''J. Law & the Environment'' (1987).</ref>  The fishery around Japan appears to have saturated at some {{convert|70000|MT}}.<ref name = "nicol2">Nicol, S.; Foster, J.: ''[http://www.edpsciences.org/articles/alr/pdf/2003/01/alr3065.pdf?access = ok Recent trends in the fishery for Antarctic krill]'', Aquat. Living Resour. '''16''', pp. 42<U+2013>45; 2003.</ref>

Experimental small-scale harvesting is being carried out in other areas, for example, fishing for ''[[Euphausia pacifica]]'' off [[British Columbia]] and harvesting ''Meganyctiphanes norvegica'', ''Thysanoessa raschii'' and ''Thysanoessa inermis'' in the [[Gulf of St. Lawrence]]. These experimental operations produce only a few hundred tonnes of krill per year. Nicol & Foster<ref name = "nicol2" /> consider it unlikely that any large-scale harvesting operations in these areas will be started due to opposition from local fishing industries and conservation groups.

Krill tastes salty and somewhat stronger than [[shrimp]]. For mass-consumption and commercially prepared products they must be peeled, because their [[exoskeleton]] contains [[fluoride]]s, which are toxic in high concentrations.<ref>Haberman, K: ''[http://quest.arc.nasa.gov/antarctica2/ask/new/Miscellaneous_questions_about_krill.txt Answers to miscellaneous questions about krill]'', [[February 26]] [[1997]]. Accessed [[September 6]] [[2007]].</ref> Excessive intake of ''okiami'' may cause [[diarrhea]].

[[Krill oil]] is said to be a good source of the [[Omega 3]] oils [[Docosahexaenoic acid|DHA]] and [[Eicosapentaenoic acid|EPA]]. [http://www.deliciousorganics.com/Controversies/omega3.htm]<br clear="all" />
