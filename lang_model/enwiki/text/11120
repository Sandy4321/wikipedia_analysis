The '''Chicago Federal Building''' in [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]] was constructed between 1898 and 1905 for the purpose of housing the [[Midwestern United States|midwest]]'s [[United States federal courts|federal court]]s, main [[post office]], and other government bureaus. It stood in [[Chicago Loop|The Loop]] neighborhood on a block bounded by Dearborn, Adams and Clark Streets and Jackson Boulevard.  The site held an 1880 post office, courthouse and customhouse which was cleared to make way for the new building.<ref name="GSA"/> The building was demolished in 1965 and replaced with the [[Kluczynski Federal Building]].

The push for a new building was spearheaded by postmaster Washington Hesing with backing by civic leaders and the Illinois' members of Congress.  The explosion of Chicago's population, especially after the [[World's Columbian Exposition]] of 1893, strained the earlier facility beyond capacity.  When the Exposition began, the Post Office Department in Chicago employed 998 clerks and 935 carriers.  By the time Congress approved funding for a new building, the post office had expanded to 1,319 clerks and 1,096 carriers.<ref name="habs">{{cite web| title=Photographs, Written Historical and Descriptive Data- United States Post Office, Customs House and Sub-Treasury, Chicago, Illinois| publisher=Historic American Buildings Survey, National Park Service| author= Larry J.

The building was designed in the [[Beaux-Arts architecture|Beaux-Arts]]<ref name="GSA"/> style by architect [[Henry Ives Cobb]]. The floorplan was a six-story [[cross|Greek cross]] atop a two-story base with a raised basement.<ref name="eoc">{{cite book| last=Lowe| first=David Garrard| coauthors=| title=Public buildings in the Loop| year=2004| work=[[Encyclopedia of Chicago]]| location=[[Chicago]]| url=http://www.encyclopedia.chicagohistory.org/pages/1019.html| publisher=[[University of Chicago Press]]| isbn=0-226-31015-9|pages=}}</ref><ref name="habs"/>  The building was capped by a dome at the crossing that held an additional eight floors of office space in its [[Drum (architecture)|drum]] for a total of 16 floors.<ref name="skyscraper">{{cite web|url=http://skyscraperpage.com/cities/?buildingID=13876|title=Chicago Federal Building|accessdate=2007-09-14|work=[[SkyscraperPage]]}}</ref>  The gilt dome extended {{convert|100|ft|abbr=on}} above the drum.

==Construction==

Congress passed a bill in late 1894 that President [[Grover Cleveland]] signed on February 13, 1895 appropriating [[United States dollar|$]]4 million to demolish the existing structure on the site and erect a new one.  The 1880 building was considered dangerous and it was inadequate to house all the federal agencies in the city whose offices consequently were spread among several buildings.<ref name="habs"/> 
 
On January 20, 1896, Congress approved an additional $25,000 to employ a special architect.  The Chicago Federal Building was the first government structure constructed with the purpose of housing the post office.<ref name="habs"/>

Demolition began on the old building in June 1896 after the post office relocated to a temporary building on the site now occupied by the [[333 North Michigan Avenue]] Building.  Foundation work began in August 1897 and was completed in September 1898 at a cost of $208,000.<ref name="habs"/>  The foundation was supported by wooden piles driven {{convert|72|ft|m}} below street level.<ref name="Lost Chicago">{{cite book|title=Lost Chicago|author=David Garrard Lowe|publisher=Watson-Gutpill Publications|location=[[New York City|New York]]|year=2000|id=ISBN 0-8020-8390-0| pages=9<U+2013>11}}</ref>  The basement and first two floors covered the entire site and measured {{convert|321|ft|abbr=on}} by {{convert|361|ft|abbr=on}}.

On April 30, 1898, work for the superstructure was awarded to John Pierce, a New York contractor, who submitted a bid of $1,897,000.  The building took seven years to construct because government policy at the time was to appropriate only enough funds for each contract as it was awarded.  There was no [[general contractor]] and over 100 separate contracts were awarded during construction.   

The completed building reached a height of {{convert|297|ft|abbr=on}} and was dedicated by President [[William McKinley]] on October 9, 1899, the twenty-eighth anniversary of the [[Great Chicago Fire]].  The areas for the post office were completed in 1904 and other agencies occupied their spaces in 1905.<ref name="habs"/>

==Architecture==
[[File:Chicago Federal Building circa 1910.jpg|thumb|275px|Federal Building looking northwest from Dearborn and Jackson ca. 1910.]]

The Federal Building was constructed over a steel frame with exterior walls of brick sheathed with {{convert|500000|sqft|abbr=on}} of gray granite from Mount Waldo, Maine.  The roofs were covered [[vitrified tile]] over book tile while the dome was covered with gilt glass tiles.  The plan called for the post office to occupy the basement and two lower floors.  The sixth, seventh and eighth floors of one wing held the courts, judges, clerks and US Marshal.  The floors in the dome were reserved for the [[United States Civil Service Commission|Civil Service Commission]], [[Railway Mail Service]] and weather bureau with other agencies occupying the remaining space.<ref name="habs"/>

The base consisted of a central entry on each facade flanked by eight bays of windows.  The bays were separated by [[Corinthian order|Corinthian]] pilasters with arches over the windows of the second floor.  A cornice and [[Baluster|balustrade]] topped the base on all four facades.  Four Corinthian columns extending from the third to sixth floor supported a pediment at on the face of each arm of the cross.  The wings on the north-south axis held seven bays long while the wings on the east-west axis held five bays as the building was situated on a rectangular lot.  The bays each held two windows grouped vertically and were separated by Corinthian [[pilasters]].  The eighth floor was housed in a shed [[dormer]]s extending from the gabled roof.  The dome was octagonal with a buttress at each corner of the drum.  The buttresses were topped by corbels supporting a large double cornice encircling the sixteenth floor with a large eagle perched atop the corbels.  The windows of the ninth through twelfth floors were set into three arches supported by more Corinthian columns.  Between the eagles, were three circular windows with elaborately carved frames and above, another circular window pierced the midpoint of each face of the dome.

After construction was complete, more than $2,000,000 remained for interior decoration of the Chicago Federal Building.<ref name="eoc"/> The four wings met under the dome to form an octagonal [[Rotunda (architecture)|rotunda]], inspired by [[Roman Empire|Imperial Roman]] [[Roman architecture|architecture]], that was open to the ninth floor.<ref name="Lost Chicago"/>  The rotunda's {{convert|100|ft|m|abbr=on}} diameter made it larger than that of the [[United States Capitol]] in [[Washington, D.C.]]<ref name="eoc"/> The federal building was also the tallest capitol-style building constructed in Chicago, with the exception of the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition buildings, all of which were demolished.  Under the dome was a large public space surrounded by the floors containing office space.<ref name="emporis">{{cite web| title=Chicago Federal Building| url=http://www.emporis.com/en/wm/bu/?id=chicagofederalbuilding-chicago-il-usa|  accessdate=2007-09-14| work=[[Emporis]]}}</ref>

The interior details were accented with [[terra cotta]] and [[scagliola]].  Doors were oak with brass hardware and "US" molded into doorknobs.  Mahogany was used in courtrooms and other offices.  Marble from Tennessee, Vermont, Maine and Italy was used in corridor floors, wainscoting and stairways.  Floors in the rotunda were marble accented with mosaic tile while railings and elevator grilles throughout the building were wrought iron.  Ceilings were framed by [[egg-and-dart]] mouldings.  The four courtrooms on the sixth floor contained a series of murals depicting historical moments in the development of law.<ref name="habs"/> 

==Notable Events==
[[File:The wreckage of Chicago's Federal Building after the explosion of a bomb allegedly planted by the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW)...1918.jpeg|thumb|250px|Adams Street entrance after the 1918 bombing]]

The Building housed the US District Court for the Northern District of Illinois until 1964 and the US Court of Appeals-Seventh Circuit until 1938.<ref name="ca7"/>  The Federal [[National Weather Service|Weather Bureau]] maintained offices in the dome and took official measurements from July 1, 1905 until December 31, 1925 when the official weather station was transferred to the [[University of Chicago]] campus.  The Federal Building site maintained supplemental observation equipment until 1970.<ref name="noaa">{{cite web| title=History of the Chicago and Rockford Weather Observation Sites| url=http://www.crh.noaa.gov/lot/?n=history| date=September 15, 2006| publisher=NOAA.gov| accessdate=2011-02-10|}}</ref>  

In 1907, Judge [[Kenesaw Mountain Landis]] presided over an [[Competition law#United States antitrust|antitrust]] case against [[Standard Oil]] in which the company was fined $29 million for accepting freight rebates from the railroads.  The verdict was later set aside but in 1920, Landis went on to become the first [[Commissioner of Baseball]]. 

On September 4, 1918, a bomb exploded on the building's north side that killed two people, destroyed the entrance doors and damaged windows of buildings across Adams Street.  Police arrested a suspect on September 7, 1918 who was linked to the [[Industrial Workers of the World]].<ref name="trib"> {{cite news| title=Bomb Planter Under Arrest, Hoyne Asserts| work=Chicago Daily Tribune| date=September 7, 1918| accessdate=2011-02-10| publisher=Chicagotribune.com| url=http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/chicagotribune/access/380342771.html?FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:AI&type=historic&date=Sep+7%2C+1918&author=&pub=Chicago+Daily+Tribune+(1872-1922)&edition=&startpage=1&desc=BOMB+PLANTER+UNDER+ARREST%2C+HOYNE+ASSERTS|}}</ref>

Another bombing attempt was October 31, 1921, however the bomb was located before it exploded.  There was no damage to the building or its inhabitants.<ref name="habs"/> 

In 1931, the courtroom of Judge [[James Herbert Wilkerson]] was the location for the trial of gangster [[Al Capone]].  On October 24, 1931, Wilkerson sentenced Capone to a 10-year in prison sentence and fine of $50,000 for [[tax evasion]].  His conviction was upheld by the appellate court on December 20, 1937.<ref name="court">{{cite web| title= Visitors to the Court-Historic Trials| publisher=US District Court-Northern District of Illinois| date=| accessdate=2011-02-10| url=http://www.ilnd.uscourts.gov/home/CourtHouseVisitors.aspx}}</ref>

The District and Circuit courts and several agencies relocated to the [[Everett McKinley Dirksen United States Courthouse|Dirksen Federal Building]]  across Dearborn Street and the building was demolished in 1965.  The 45-floor [[Kluczynski Federal Building]] and Loop Postal Station, designed by [[Ludwig Mies van der Rohe]], were built in its place.  The plaza between the three structures is the setting for [[Alexander Calder]]'s sculpture [[Flamingo (sculpture)|Flamingo]].
