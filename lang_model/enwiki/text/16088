The '''Dix-Hallpike test''' (or '''Nylen-Barany test''') is used to identify causes of [[Vertigo (medical)|vertigo]]. The Hallpike maneuver is performed with the patient sitting up with the legs extended. Then their head is rotated approximately 30 degrees one way and the practitioner helps them lie down quickly with the head in a position of extension. This extension may either be achieved by means of allowing the patient's head to hang over the edge of the treatment table or by placing a pillow under their upper back. The patient's eyes are then observed for about 30 seconds. If [[nystagmus]] (usually in an infero-superior direction) occurs then the test is considered positive for benign positional vertigo. Subsequently the patient brought back up into the seated position, their head is rotated the other way and the maneuver is repeated. If the test is negative it makes benign positional vertigo a less likely diagnosis and CNS involvement should be considered more actively. '''Note''' that the [[nystagmus]] may come in paroxysms and may be delayed by several seconds after the maneuver is performed.
