'''Steven Lynn "Steve" Beshear''' (born September 21, 1944) is the [[List of Governors of Kentucky|61st and current]] [[Governor of Kentucky|Governor]] of the [[U.S. state|Commonwealth]] of [[Kentucky]]. Elected in 2007, Beshear previously served in the [[Kentucky House of Representatives]] from 1974 to 1979, was the state's [[Attorney General of Kentucky|Attorney General]] from 1980 to 1983, and was [[Lieutenant Governor of Kentucky|Lieutenant Governor]] from 1983 to 1987. Beshear's term expires in 2011, and he is seeking re-election. His running mate for the [[Kentucky gubernatorial election, 2011|2011 gubernatorial election]] will be [[Louisville, Kentucky|Louisville]] mayor [[Jerry Abramson]]; Lieutenant Governor [[Daniel Mongiardo]] opted to enter the [[United States Senate election in Kentucky, 2010|2010 Senate race]] instead of seeking re-election.

After graduating from the [[University of Kentucky]] in 1968, Beshear briefly practiced law in [[New York]] before returning to Kentucky and being elected to the [[Kentucky General Assembly|state legislature]], where he gained a reputation as a consumer advocate. He parlayed that reputation into a term as attorney general, serving under Governor [[John Y. Brown, Jr.]] As attorney general, Beshear issued a controversial opinion that copies of the [[Ten Commandments]] would have to be removed from the walls of the state's classrooms in the wake of the [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]]'s decision in ''[[Stone v. Graham]]''. He also clashed with first lady [[Phyllis George Brown]] over charging the state's citizens an admission fee to view the renovated [[Kentucky Governor's Mansion|governor's mansion]]. In 1983, Beshear was elected lieutenant governor in the administration of Governor [[Martha Layne Collins]]. His most significant action in this capacity was the formation of the Kentucky Tomorrow Commission, a panel charged with making recommendations for the future of the state.

Beshear's rapid political rise was brought to an abrupt halt when he finished third in the five-way [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] gubernatorial [[primary election|primary]] in 1987. Beshear's campaign sparring with former Governor Brown, the second-place finisher in the primary, opened the door for political novice [[Wallace Wilkinson]]'s well-financed campaign to achieve a come-from-behind upset in the race. For the next 20 years, Beshear practiced law at a [[Lexington, Kentucky|Lexington]] law firm. His only foray into politics during this period was his unsuccessful challenge to [[United States Senate|Senator]] [[Mitch McConnell]] in [[United States Senate election in Kentucky, 1996|1996]]. In 2007, however, Beshear was drawn back into politics by the vulnerability of incumbent [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] Governor [[Ernie Fletcher]], whose administration was the subject of a protracted investigation by Attorney General [[Greg Stumbo]] because of alleged violations of the state's [[merit system]]. Beshear emerged from a six-way Democratic primary &ndash; largely on the strength of his pledge to bring expanded [[casino]] gambling to Kentucky &ndash; and handily defeated Fletcher in the [[Kentucky gubernatorial election, 2007|2007 gubernatorial election]]. So far, Beshear's opposition in the Republican-controlled [[Kentucky Senate]] has prevented him from delivering on his gambling proposal, and an [[Late 2000s <U+2013> early 2010s recession in the Americas|economic recession]] has largely kept him from addressing other priorities of his administration.

==Early life==
Steve Beshear was born in [[Hopkins County, Kentucky]] on September 21, 1944.<ref name=advocate>Rugeley, "Beshear Sees Role as People's Advocate"</ref> He was the third of five children born to Russell and Mary Elizabeth Beshear.<ref name=advocate /> He was raised in the small town of [[Dawson Springs, Kentucky|Dawson Springs]], where his father owned a furniture store, operated a [[funeral home]], and served as mayor.<ref name=determination>Massey, "Determination Spices Political Career"</ref> His father, grandfather, and uncle were all [[Primitive Baptist]] lay ministers, and in his childhood years, Beshear attended both his father's church and the [[Christian Church (Disciples of Christ)|Christian Church]] where his mother was a member.<ref name=faith>Brammer, "Political Differences, Parallel Faiths"</ref> Beshear also accompanied his uncle, Fred Beshear, as he traveled around the county during several races for a seat in the [[Kentucky House of Representatives|state House of Representatives]].<ref name=advocate />

Beshear graduated as [[valedictorian]] in a class of 28 at [[Dawson Springs High School]] in 1962.<ref name=determination /> He then attended the [[University of Kentucky]] where he earned a [[Bachelor of Arts]] degree in history in 1966.<ref name=determination /> He was a member of the [[Delta Tau Delta]] social fraternity and the [[Phi Beta Kappa Society|Phi Beta Kappa honor society]].<ref name=determination /><ref>"Famous Delts". Delta Tau Delta</ref> He was also elected student body treasurer and from 1964 to 1965 served as student body president.<ref name=determination /> While in college, he attended Lexington Primitive Baptist Church and often had lunch at the home of Harold and Marie Fletcher, whose son Ernie he would eventually challenge for the governorship of Kentucky.<ref name=faith /> 

In 1968, Beshear graduated with honors from the [[University of Kentucky College of Law]].<ref name=determination /> He and his wife, the former Jane Klingner, were married in 1969.<ref name=advocate /> After the marriage, Beshear joined the Crestwood Christian Church where his wife attended.<ref name=faith /> The couple have two sons, Jeffery Scott Beshear and Andrew Graham Beshear and two grandsons.<ref name=advocate /><ref name=dga>"Steve Beshear". Democratic Governors Association</ref> Following their marriage, the Beshears moved to [[New York]] where Steve worked for the [[Wall Street]] law firm of [[White & Case]].<ref name=vets>Wagar, "2 Political Veterans Seek Senate Post"</ref> He also served as an intelligence specialist in the [[United States Army Reserve]], performing some of the duties of a [[judge advocate general]].<ref name=nga>"Kentucky Governor Steven L. Beshear". National Governors Association</ref><ref name=manoffaith>Alford, "Beshear Tells Voters He's a Man of Faith"</ref> After two and a half years, the family returned to Kentucky, and Beshear joined the [[Lexington, Kentucky|Lexington]] law firm of Harbison, Kessinger, Lisle and Bush.<ref name=vets /> He went into practice for himself in 1974, then formed the law firm of Beshear, Meng, and Green, where he worked until his election as attorney general in 1979.<ref name=vets />

==Early political career==
In 1973, Beshear began his political career by being elected to represent the 76th District ([[Fayette County, Kentucky|Fayette County]]) in the [[Kentucky House of Representatives]].<ref name=determination /><ref>"1973 Election Results for the Kentucky House of Representatives". Kentucky Secretary of State</ref> During his first term, his colleagues named him the outstanding freshman legislator.<ref name=vets /> He was re-elected in 1975 and 1977; both campaigns featured close Democratic primaries between Beshear and Jerry Lundergan.<ref>"1975 Election Results for the Kentucky House of Representatives". Kentucky Secretary of State</ref><ref>"1977 Election Results for the Kentucky House of Representatives". Kentucky Secretary of State</ref> 

As a legislator, Beshear gained a reputation as a consumer advocate, and sponsored bills to increase environmental protections and end the practice of commercial [[bail bondsman|bail bonding]].<ref name=vets /> In 1974, Beshear voted against a resolution condemning the practice of [[Desegregation busing in the United States|desegregation busing]] because it called for changes to the [[United States Constitution|federal constitution]].<ref name=vets /> One of his major accomplishments in the House was spearheading legislation to improve neonatal care at the [[Chandler Medical Center|University of Kentucky Medical Center]].<ref name=determination /> Although he considered a 1978 bill requiring the posting of the [[Ten Commandments]] in Kentucky classrooms to be unconstitutional, he abstained from voting on it rather than voting against it, a move he later claimed he regretted.<ref name=vets />

===Attorney General===
Beshear was the first candidate to announce his bid for the post of [[Attorney General of Kentucky]] in the 1979 election; shortly after declaring his candidacy, he was endorsed by outgoing Attorney General [[Robert F. Stephens]].<ref>Sparrow, "Stephens Endorses Beshear"</ref> The central issue of Beshear's campaign was his pledge to be an advocate of the consumer in cases of proposed utility rate hikes.<ref>"Beshear Pledges Consumer Activism"</ref> After winning the Democratic primary, he defeated Republican nominee Ron Snyder by a vote of 471,177 to 302,951.<ref>"1979 General Election Results for Attorney General". Kentucky Secretary of State</ref> When incumbent Attorney General Stephens resigned in December 1979 to accept an appointment to the [[Kentucky Supreme Court]], Beshear was appointed to fill the vacancy until his term officially began in January.<ref>Braden, "Swearing In: Two Judicial Posts Filled"</ref> As attorney general, Beshear created the state's first [[Medicaid]] fraud division and his office took a leading role in the Leviticus Project, an eight-state coalition committed to prosecuting [[organized crime]] in the country's coal fields.<ref name=vets />

[[File:KY Governors Mansion.png|thumb|left|alt=A pillared, two-story, gray marble building with several flower gardens in front|Beshear objected to the Save the Mansion Fund charging a fee to tour the Governor's Mansion]]
Two minor controversies marked Beshear's tenure as attorney general. The first came in the aftermath of the [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]]'s ruling in the 1980 case of ''[[Stone v. Graham]]''.<ref name=history10>"History of Ten Commandments Legislation". Lexington Herald-Leader</ref> The ruling struck down the state law requiring the posting of the [[Ten Commandments]] in all of the state's classrooms on grounds that it violated the [[Establishment Clause of the First Amendment|Establishment Clause]] of the federal constitution.<ref name=history10 /> State [[Superintendent (education)|Superintendent]] Raymond Barber asked the Supreme Court to clarify whether its ruling meant that all of the copies of the Commandments already posted had to be taken down or whether it simply invalidated the Kentucky requirement for them to be posted; the Court refused the request for clarification.<ref name=clarification>"Justices Won't Explain Commandments Ruling to Kentucky Officials". The Daily News</ref> Beshear then issued an advisory opinion that displaying the Commandments in classroom's under any circumstances was banned by the Court's ruling.<ref name=tt10>"Today's Topic: Ten Commandments". The Telegraph</ref> 

The second controversy arose as a result of the renovation of the [[Kentucky Governor's Mansion|governor's mansion]]. Kentucky [[first lady]] [[Phyllis George Brown]] created the Save the Mansion Fund to help cover the costs of the renovation. When the renovation was complete, she planned a nine-day showcase of the mansion for the general public. Guests were charged $10 to take a tour of the mansion. Legislator [[Eugene P. Stuart]] objected to taxpayers being charged a fee to view a mansion their tax dollars supported. He asked Beshear to protest the charge, and Beshear requested an injunction against the Save the Mansion Fund. A Lexington judge refused to grant the injunction, and Beshear appealed to the [[Kentucky Court of Appeals]] which upheld the lower court's decision. Beshear's actions caused a rift between him and Governor [[John Y. Brown, Jr.]]<ref>Clark, pp. 208&ndash;209</ref>

===Lieutenant Governor===
[[Term limits in the United States|Limited to one term]] as attorney general by the [[Kentucky Constitution|state constitution]],  Beshear declared his candidacy for [[Lieutenant Governor of Kentucky|lieutenant governor]] in 1983. In a seven-candidate Democratic primary in May, Beshear captured 183,662 of the 575,022 votes cast to defeat a field that included former state Auditor George L. Atkins, [[Jefferson County, Kentucky|Jefferson County]] [[County Judge/Executive|judge executive]] Todd Hollenbach, Agriculture Commissioner Alben Barkley II, and former [[Kentucky Wildcats men's basketball|Kentucky Wildcat basketball]] star [[Bill Spivey]].<ref>Cohn, "Beshear and McDonald Post Large Victory Margins"</ref><ref>"1983 Primary Election Results for Lieutenant Governor". Kentucky Secretary of State</ref> In the general election, Beshear faced Republican Eugene Stuart and Don Wiggins, who became the nominee of the newly-formed Consumers Lobby Party after losing in the Republican gubernatorial primary.<ref name=accusations>Brammer, "Accusations Riddle Race for State's Lieutenant Governor"</ref> Stuart categorized Beshear as being too [[Liberalism|liberal]] for Kentucky, citing his opinion in the Ten Commandments case, as well as his support for [[abortion rights]] and [[Gun control in the United States|gun control]].<ref name=accusations /> Beshear denied he advocated gun control and charged that Stuart, a state senator from Jefferson County, had not shown any leadership worthy of election to the lieutenant governor's office.<ref name=accusations /> Beshear easily defeated Stuart by a vote of 568,869 to 321,352; Wiggins captured just 7,728 votes.<ref>"1983 General Election Results for Lieutenant Governor". Kentucky Secretary of State</ref>

[[File:Martha Layne Collins, governor of Kentucky, Nov 8, 1986.jpg|thumb|right|alt=A dark-haired woman in her fifties making a speech behind a podium and microphone|Martha Layne Collins preceded Beshear as lieutenant governor and was governor during Beshear's term in that office.]]
Several changes were proposed to the office of lieutenant governor during Beshear's tenure. In 1984, state Representative Bobby Richardson proposed a constitutional amendment to abolish the office.<ref name=ltgov>"Lieutenant Governor Changes Sought", ''The Daily News''</ref> When that effort failed, Richardson introduced a bill in the 1986 General Assembly that would have revoked the lieutenant governor's right to live rent-free in the state's [[Old Governor's Mansion (Frankfort, Kentucky)|Old Governor's Mansion]], eliminated his or her police protection, and restricted his or her use of the state's two executive helicopters.<ref name=perks>Rugeley, "Measure to Remove Perks of Lieutenant Governor Fails"</ref> The measure would also have eliminated the lieutenant governor's salary, paying him or her ''[[per diem]]'' for days served as acting governor or president of the [[Kentucky Senate|state senate]] instead; the measure would further have lifted the ban on the lieutenant governor holding other employment.<ref name=strip>Duke, "Bill Would Strip No. 2 Official of Many Perks"</ref> Although the bill would have exempted Beshear from its provisions, Beshear still opposed it and charged that it was politically motivated.<ref name=strip /> Richardson had expressed interest in running for lieutenant governor in the past, and Beshear claimed that because he was never elected to the office, he "doesn't want anybody else to have it."<ref name=strip /> Richardson denied that his efforts were a political ploy; he claimed the office was largely ceremonial and served only as a stepping stone to the governorship.<ref name=perks /> Three of the previous four lieutenant governors had subsequently been elected governor, including sitting governor [[Martha Layne Collins]].<ref name=ltgov />

Despite opposing Richardson's changes to the office, Beshear conceded that the provision of the state constitution that made him acting governor every time Governor Collins left the state was "archaic".<ref name=archaic>Chellgren, "Acting Governor Role 'Archaic' to Beshear"</ref> During its 1987 organizational session, the General Assembly relieved the lieutenant governor of his membership on the committees that assigned bills to other committees and that managed the flow of legislation on the Senate floor.<ref name=ltgov /> Later that year, a subcommittee of the Commission on Constitutional Review proposed requiring the governor and lieutenant governor to run as a [[Ticket (election)|ticket]] and combining the office with that of the secretary of state.<ref name=ltgov /> These recommendations were not acted on during Beshear's term.

During his service as lieutenant governor, Beshear formed and chaired the Kentucky Tomorrow Commission, a privately-financed group assembled to make recommendations for the state's future growth and development.<ref name=advocate /> The 30-person commission was formed in July 1984 and presented its report &ndash; containing more than 100 recommendations &ndash; in September 1986.<ref>Rugeley, "Study on Kentucky's Future Also Good for Beshear"</ref> Among the recommendations in the commission's report were several changes to the state constitution, adopted in 1891.<ref name=const>Wolfe, "Legislators Hear Beshear's Reasons for New Constitution"</ref> The recommended changes included eliminating the offices of state treasurer, secretary of state and superintendent of public instruction, holding elections only in odd-numbered years instead of every year, and raising the term limit for the state's constitutional officers from one term to two consecutive terms.<ref name=const /> The state legislature showed little interest in calling a constitutional convention, however, and the commission's recommendations were not adopted.<ref name=const /> Other recommendations in the commission's report included the creation of [[lifelong learning]] programs, implementation of criminal justice reforms, and improvements in worker training.<ref name=vets /> The commission was hailed by some as the most substantial undertaking by a lieutenant governor to date, but was panned by others as a move by Beshear to better position himself for a run for governor in 1987.<ref name=advocate />

Among Beshear's other activities as lieutenant governor was his participation in an investigation of [[Kentucky Utilities]]' coal-buying practices. At issue was whether it was legal and ethical for the company's coal buyer to accept gifts and other perks from coal suppliers. Beshear had clashed with the company over similar issues during his term as attorney general. The company attempted to block Beshear's participation in the investigation, but the [[Kentucky Public Service Commission]] rejected the attempt. Due to the length of the investigation and the number of appeals filed, the matter was not fully adjudicated until 1992, well past the end of Beshear's term. The [[Kentucky Supreme Court]] ultimately ruled in favor of Kentucky Utilities.<ref>Wagar, "Charges Put KU on Defensive"</ref><ref>"Coal Ruling 'Chilling' For Business, Firm Says". ''The Kentucky Post''</ref>

In 1987, Beshear entered a crowded Democratic gubernatorial primary that included former governor [[Julian Carroll]], millionaire bookstore magnate [[Wallace Wilkinson]], and Eastern Kentucky physician Grady Stumbo.<ref name=nhok420>Harrison, p. 420</ref> Beshear had the backing of the Collins administration and the endorsement of several [[trade union|labor]] leaders and the state teachers' association; he appeared to be the front-runner in the race until former governor John Y. Brown, Jr. entered late and became the instant favorite.<ref name=upset /> Beshear spent much of the campaign running ads that blasted Brown for his jet-setting lifestyle including, the ads claimed, his "wild nights in [[Las Vegas, Nevada|Vegas]]".<ref name=model>Dionne, "Kentucky's Race is the Very Model of a Modern Major Political Primary"</ref> Brown countered with ads claiming that Beshear was distorting the facts and could not be trusted.<ref name=model /> Both Beshear and Brown claimed the other would raise taxes if he were elected.<ref name=model /> The feud between Beshear and Brown allowed Wilkinson, who was last among the candidates according to polls as late as February 1987, to launch his own blitz of ads claiming both Beshear and Brown would raise taxes and proposing a [[Kentucky Lottery|state lottery]] as an alternative means of raising funds for the state.<ref name=model /><ref name=upset>Dionne, "Brown Upset in Kentucky Primary Bid"</ref> In the final days of the campaign, Wilkinson surged past both Brown and Beshear and captured 221,138 votes to win the primary; Beshear finished third with 114,439, trailing Brown (163,204 votes) but leading Stumbo (84,613 votes), Carroll (42,137 votes), and three minor candidates.<ref>"1987 Primary Election Results for Governor/Lt. Governor". Kentucky Secretary of State</ref>

==Political interim and 1996 Senate bid==
{{Seealso|United States Senate election in Kentucky, 1996}} 
After his defeat in the 1987 election, Beshear moved to a 35-acre farm in [[Clark County, Kentucky|Clark County]].<ref name=vets /> He resumed his career as a lawyer, joining the 125-member Lexington law firm of Stites and Harbison.<ref name=determination /> He handled several high-profile cases such as the [[bankruptcy]] of [[Calumet Farm]] and the liquidation of the [[Kentucky Central Insurance Company]].<ref name=determination /> He underwent successful surgery to treat [[prostate cancer]] in 1994.<ref name=snub>Carlton, "Beshear is Acting Like a Winner, but Primary Foes Stung by Snub"</ref>

[[File:Sen Mitch McConnell official.jpg|thumb|left|alt=A man in his late sixties with graying hair and glasses leaning against a column and wearing black suit, white shirt, and blue tie|Mitch McConnell turned back Beshear's challenge for his Senate seat in 1996]]
Beshear did little in the political arena for almost a decade after his 1987 primary defeat, but in late 1995, he was encouraged by Democratic leaders &ndash; including former governor [[Edward T. Breathitt|Ned Breathitt]], Senator [[Wendell H. Ford]], and [[Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee]] chair [[Bob Kerrey]] &ndash; to challenge incumbent Republican Senator [[Mitch McConnell]].<ref name=snub /> Beshear entered the primary as a heavy favorite against [[Thomas Barlow (politician)|Tom Barlow]], a former one-term [[United States House of Representatives|Congressman]] from [[Kentucky's 1st congressional district|Kentucky's First District]], and Shelby Lanier, a retired Louisville police officer.<ref name=snub /> During the primary campaign, Beshear virtually ignored Barlow and Lanier and focused his rhetoric on McConnell.<ref name=snub /> Despite Barlow's tour of all [[List of counties in Kentucky|120 Kentucky counties]], Beshear cruised to victory in the primary, garnering 177,859 votes to Barlow's 64,235 and Lanier's 25,856.<ref name=snub /><ref>"1996 Primary Election Results for United States Senator". Kentucky Secretary of State</ref> 

Beshear faced heavy deficits in polls against McConnell throughout the general election campaign. McConnell also raised twice as much money as Beshear during the campaign. Beshear tried to make McConnell's fundraising a campaign issue, claiming much of the money came from [[political action committee]]s that represented interests that lobbied the Senate committees on which McConnell served. McConnell defended his contributors, saying that the right to free speech included the right to donate money. Beshear charged that Republicans, including McConnell, had voted to cut [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]]; McConnell responded that Republicans had not cut Medicare, but had put forward a plan to curb its growth, a plan that didn't differ significantly, McConnell said, from the one proposed by Democratic [[President of the United States|President]] [[Bill Clinton]].<ref name=blowout>Straub, "Senate Race: Blowout"</ref>

The campaign turned personal during the second of two debates between the two candidates when McConnell charged that the Iroquois Hunt Club, to which Beshear belonged, had no [[African-American]] members and was racially discriminatory.<ref name=harsher>Estep, "Second Senate Debate Harsher"</ref> Beshear denied that the club was discriminatory and fired back that a prominent McConnell supporter from Louisville was "virulently anti-women."<ref name=harsher /> McConnell countered that Beshear had taken money from a labor union group that was under investigation for links to organized crime.<ref name=harsher /> After the debate, it was revealed that the Pendennis Club, of which McConnell had been a member, was under investigation for discriminatory membership practices; McConnell claimed he had resigned his membership in the club after perceiving that it practiced discrimination, but did not express his reasons for resigning to the club's membership or leadership.<ref name=club>Carlton, "McConnell Also Belonged to 'Exclusive All-White Club'"</ref> Ultimately, none of Beshear's arguments gained much traction, and he lost the race by a vote of 560,012 to 724,794 for McConnell.<ref>"1996 General Election Results for United States Senator". Kentucky Secretary of State</ref> It was the largest victory margin of McConnell's career.<ref>Carlton, "McConnell Wins Third Term by His Largest Margin Ever"</ref> In a 2009 biography of McConnell, author John David Dyche wrote that Beshear "had no illusions about his chance of success [in the race against McConnell], but for the sake of his party, and hoping to ride the coattails of President Clinton's likely re-election, he got in the race."<ref name=mcconnellbook>Brammer, "McConnell's Career Boiled Down in Book"</ref> After the book's release, Beshear said through a spokesman that Dyche's assessment "sounds accurate."<ref name=mcconnellbook />

Beshear continued his legal practice at Stites and Harbison following his defeat by McConnnell. In 2001, the firm was hired to represent creditors in a bankruptcy case against Wallace Wilkinson, Beshear's opponent in the 1987 gubernatorial primary.<ref name=remove>Jordan, "Wilkinson Tries to Remove Beshear From Case, Fails"</ref> The firm also represented four creditors of Wallace's Bookstore, the company through which Wilkinson had made his fortune.<ref name=remove /> Wilkinson unsuccessfully sought to have the firm removed from the case, citing a potential [[conflict of interest]] stemming from his old political rivalry with Beshear.<ref name=remove /> The case was eventually settled in 2002, four months after Wilkinson's death.<ref name=settlement>Jordan, "Tentative Wilkinson Deal Filed"</ref>

==2007 gubernatorial campaign==
[[File:Ernie Fletcher.jpg|thumb|right|alt=A dark-haired man in his forties wearing glasses and a suit. He is smiling and facing left.|Governor Ernie Fletcher failed in his re-election bid against Beshear]]
{{Main|Kentucky gubernatorial election, 2007}}

On December 18, 2007, Beshear announced that he would enter the 2007 gubernatorial race with [[Hazard, Kentucky|Hazard]] physician and state senator [[Daniel Mongiardo]] as his [[running mate]].<ref name=announce>Stamper, "Beshear Enters Race for Governor"</ref> Beshear promised to return "integrity" to the governor's office, a slap at sitting governor [[Ernie Fletcher]], who was seeking re-election despite a recently-concluded investigation into his administration's hiring practices conducted by Democratic Attorney General [[Greg Stumbo]].<ref name=announce /> At the time, the only other declared Democratic candidates were state treasurer [[Jonathan Miller (Kentucky politician)|Jonathan Miller]] and [[Harlan, Kentucky|Harlan]] contractor Otis Hensley, Jr., who only ran a limited campaign.<ref name=expansion>Brammer, "Beshear Backs Vote on Gaming Expansion"</ref> By the filing deadline, the list of Democratic challengers had grown to include Louisville millionaire businessman [[Bruce Lunsford]], former lieutenant governor [[Steve Henry]], [[Speaker of the Kentucky House of Representatives]] [[Jody Richards]], and [[perennial candidate]] [[Gatewood Galbraith]].<ref name=ten>Alford, "Ten Will Compete for Governorship"</ref>

Early polls showed that Beshear and Henry led the Democratic field in name recognition, but both trailed Fletcher and his Republican primary rival [[Anne Northup]] in that area.<ref name=namerec>"Poll: 49% of Voters View Fletcher Unfavorably". The Kentucky Post</ref> Early in the campaign, Beshear attempted to set himself apart from the other candidates by supporting a constitutional amendment that would allow expanded casino gambling in the state, which he claimed could generate $500 million in new revenue without the need to raise taxes.<ref name=expansion /> Observers noted that this strategy was remarkably similar to the one used by Wallace Wilkinson who, in his 1987 primary victory over Beshear and others, trumpeted the revenue a state lottery would generate.<ref name=expansion /> Initially, all of the Democratic candidates except Hensley endorsed a casino amendment, but as Beshear made it the centerpiece of his campaign, support from other candidates began to waver; Richards officially changed his position to oppose the amendment, while several other candidates charged that Beshear was staking too much of his platform on a proposal that was not guaranteed to pass.<ref name=pivotal>Massey, "Expanded Gambling Pivotal to Beshear"</ref>

In April 2007, Beshear received the endorsement of former Governor [[Brereton Jones]].<ref>Alessi, "Jones Endorses Beshear Ticket"</ref> Just two weeks before the primary, candidate Jonathan Miller dropped out of the race and endorsed Beshear.<ref name=millerendorse>Alessi and Stamper, "Miller Quits, Backs Beshear"</ref> Miller, who was consistently lagging in the polls, indicated that he was endorsing Beshear in order to prevent an "unelectable" candidate from becoming the Democratic Party's nominee for the fall campaign.<ref name=millerendorse /> He later admitted that comment was aimed at Lunsford, who dropped out of the 2003 Democratic gubernatorial primary and in the general election endorsed Fletcher over Democrat [[Ben Chandler]], and at Henry, who faced allegations of illegal medical billing and improper campaign financing.<ref name=millerendorse /> Buoyed by these endorsements, Beshear surged ahead and won the primary; he garnered 40.9 percent of the vote, just enough to avoid a costly [[Two-round system|runoff election]] with Lunsford, the second place finisher.<ref name=runoff>Brammer, "Democrats Avoiding Runoff is a Big Boost for Beshear"</ref>

Incumbent governor Fletcher emerged from the Republican primary, and Beshear immediately looked to make the investigation against Fletcher the primary issue of the campaign.<ref name=alterpos>Stamper, "Fletcher Alters Stand on Casinos"</ref> Fletcher countered by strengthening his opposition to Beshear's casino expansion plan.<ref name=alterpos /> In June 2007, Fletcher backed off an earlier commitment to let Kentuckians vote on casino gambling amendment; a campaign staffer told reporters that "The voters will have their chance to decide this issue in [the] November [election]. To put it on the ballot would be redundant."<ref name=alterpos /> Fletcher's choice to make casino gambling the centerpiece of the campaign proved ineffective. After months of campaigning on the issue, a [[SurveyUSA]] poll showed that Fletcher had gained only 6 percentage points on Beshear and still trailed him by 16 percentage points.<ref name=fading>Alessi, "Fletcher's No-Casino Message Fading"</ref> Further, polling showed that more than half of the state's voters believed Fletcher had acted unethically with regard to the claims in the hiring investigation while 81% believed the casino gambling amendment should be placed on the ballot.<ref name=fading /><ref name=resonate>Stamper, "Beshear's Message on Ethics Resonates"</ref> Late in the campaign, eight of Kentucky's leading newspapers endorsed Beshear.<ref name=endorsements>Biesk, "Major Newspapers Back Beshear"</ref> Ultimately, Beshear was elected by a vote of 619,567 to 435,856.<ref name=elected>Alford, "Beshear Elected Governor"</ref>

Soon after taking office, Beshear ordered $78 million in budget cuts, citing a $434 million projected deficit in the state budget. Republican [[President of the Kentucky Senate|Senate President]] [[David L. Williams|David Williams]] questioned the legality of the cuts, claiming that the shortfall was only $117.5 million and that $145 million in surplus funds from the previous fiscal year would cover the difference. Beshear countered that the legislature had already authorized $138 million in expenditures from the surplus fund and that his reckoning of the deficit also included $300 in "additional spending needs". Williams stopped short of filing a legal challenge to the cuts, but warned Beshear that the General Assembly would closely monitor the cuts and override any they disagreed with by passing modifications to the 2006&ndash;2008 budget after the commencement of the legislative session in February.<ref name=cuts>Stamper, "Beshear Disregarding State Law, Williams Says"</ref>

Beshear was dealt the first political setback of his term in the special election to fill the state Senate seat of his lieutenant governor, Daniel Mongiardo.<ref name=first100>Alessi, "Rocky Start a Surprise to Rookie Governor"</ref> Despite a 2-to-1 voter registration advantage in the district for the Democrats and the fact that both Beshear and Mongiardo campaigned heavily for Democratic nominee Scott Alexander, Republican Brandon Smith captured the open seat by 401 votes.<ref name=gopsenate>Alessi, "State Senate Seat Won by GOP"</ref> The loss by Alexander was the most expensive in state legislative history and gave Republicans a 22&ndash;15 advantage over the Democrats in the state senate; the chamber also included one [[Independent (politician)|Independent]].<ref name=first100 /><ref name=gopsenate />

===2008 legislative session and special session===
Much of the debate in the 2008 legislative session centered on crafting a budget for the 2008&ndash;2010 biennium, a period when the state was projected to encounter a shortfall of nearly $1 billion.<ref name=pause>Covington, "Beshear's Big Plans on Hold"</ref> Beshear expressed surprise that the budget issues consumed so much of the Assembly's time during the session, but admitted that the legislature had become much more independent of the governor than it was when he was a legislator two decades earlier.<ref name=first100 /><ref name=pause /> He listed early childhood education and expanded health care for children among the priorities that he was unable to address in the session.<ref name=pause />

On February 15, 2008, Beshear unveiled his promised legislation that would allow casino gambling in Kentucky.<ref name=gate>Patton and Stamper, "Casinos in Starting Gate"</ref> Beshear's plan included a constitutional amendment allowing 12 casinos to be licensed in the state &ndash; seven at each of the state's horse racetracks and five additional free-standing casinos &ndash; and a companion bill specifying how the increased revenues would be spent.<ref name=gate /> After the plan encountered initial resistance, House leadership reduced the number of casinos that would have been allowed to by the amendment to nine.<ref name=dead>Patton, "Casino Bill Declared Dead"</ref> One proposal, authored by House Speaker Jody Richards, would have guaranteed five casino licenses to the state's racetracks and allowed the other four to go to free-standing casinos.<ref name=apel>Apel, "Kentucky Expanded-Gaming Amendment Fails to Advance"</ref> A competing measure, drafted by House [[Whip (politics)|Majority Whip]] [[Rob Wilkey]] and [[Speaker (politics)|Speaker]] [[Pro Tempore|Pro Tem]] [[Larry Clark (Kentucky politician)|Larry Clark]], would have allowed all nine licenses to be awarded competitively, with none specifically reserved for racetracks.<ref name=apel /> In late February, the House Elections, Constitutional Amendments, and Intergovernmental Affairs committee failed to advance either proposal to the full floor of the House of Representatives.<ref name=apel /> The following day, Speaker Richards removed Representative Dottie Sims from the committee; Sims claimed Richards retaliated against her for voting against the proposals, but Richards said he removed Sims because she told him she would vote for the proposals and then voted against them.<ref name=schnyder>Schnyder, "Casino Bill Moves Forward After Passage by House Committee"</ref> Following Sims' removal the committee passed the amendment.<ref name=schnyder /> 

The casino legislation was not called to a vote in the Democratic controlled Kentucky House of Representatives, where 60 votes out of 100 would have been required for passage. Beshear announced that his proposal for a constitutional amendment to allow for casinos was dead for the regular session on March 27, 2008.<ref name=dead /> Among the other proposals favored by Beshear that failed to pass in the session were an ethics reform measure Beshear proposed in the wake of the investigation of the Fletcher administration, a plan to reduce the projected shortfall in the state's pension system, and a proposed 70-cent-per-pack tax increase on [[cigarette]]s.<ref name=midnight>Alessi, "Legislature Strikes Midnight"</ref> Besides the state budget, major legislation passed during the session included incentives for homeowners and businesses to utilize energy efficiency measures, anti-[[bullying]] legislation, and increased penalties for [[Cruelty to animals|animal cruelty]].<ref name=midnight />

In the final hours of the legislative session, both houses of the General Assembly resorted to the controversial practice of stopping the clocks in their respective chambers a few minutes before midnight in order to avoid the constitutionally-mandated deadline for the end of the session &ndash; midnight on April 15. The Assembly then passed twelve bills between midnight and 1 o'clock on April 16 before adjourning. Among those bills was House Bill 79, which provided funding and direction for the state's road-building plan for the next six years. The bill was delivered to Beshear later in the day, and he [[veto]]ed it on April 26. With the General Assembly unable to reconvene and override the veto, Senate President David Williams filed suit, claiming Beshear's veto was invalid because it was not issued within 10 days of the bill's passage. Williams' reasoning was based on the fact that, according to the legislative record, the bill was passed on April 15. Beshear counter-sued, claiming the bill was actually passed on April 16 and thus invalid to begin with. On July 31, 2008, a Lexington judge sided with Beshear, invalidating the law and declaring that the General Assembly would no longer be allowed to use the practice of stopping the clocks; he did not rule on the validity of the other bills passed after the session expired.<ref name=clockstop>Brammer, "'Stop-The-Clock' Practice Ruled Unconstitutional"</ref>

Dissatisfied that the General Assembly had not acted to shore up the state pension system, Beshear called a special legislative session for July 23, 2008 after House and Senate leaders informed him that they had reached an agreement on a plan after the regular legislative session's end.<ref name=pensionsession>Brammer, "Special Session Called"</ref> The session lasted five days, the minimum amount of time required to maneuver the bill through the legislative process.<ref name=pensionsession /><ref name=pensionpass>Alessi, "Assembly Passes Pension Reforms"</ref>

===Other matters of 2008===
Following the legislative session, Beshear began to address his agenda related to energy production. In April 2008, he announced that he would divide the state's Environmental and Public Protection Cabinet to form a new Energy and Environmental Cabinet.<ref name=energycab>Brammer, "Beshear to Split Diverse Cabinet"</ref> The move essentially reversed the consolidation of Environmental, Public Protection, and Labor Cabinets effected under Beshear's predecessor, Ernie Fletcher.<ref name=energycab /> Later in the year, Beshear released what he called the state's first-ever comprehensive energy plan.<ref name=energyplan>Mead and Brammer, "Goal: More Jobs, Less Gas"</ref> The plan called for expansion of [[solar power|solar]], [[wind power|wind]], and [[biomass]] energy generation, as well as more speculative ventures such as [[coal gasification]] and [[carbon capture and sequestration]].<ref name=energyplan /> Although the plan called for an exploration of the use of [[nuclear power]], Beshear stopped short of advocating an end to the state's ban on the construction of nuclear reactors.<ref name=energyplan />

[[File:"Zap" Concept Car.JPG|thumb|left|alt=An extremely compact white car with black, zebra-like stripes behind black cordons|ZAP cars like this one would have been manufactured in Kentucky before the proposed factory lost its funding]]
Hoping to attract a proposed [[ZAP (motor company)|ZAP]] [[electric vehicle]] manufacturing plant to the city of [[Franklin, Kentucky]], Beshear issued an executive order permitting low-speed vehicles on many Kentucky roads in August 2008.<ref name=speed>Brammer, "Beshear Clears Roads for Electric Car Plant"</ref> The state also offered the company $48 million in tax incentives, contingent upon its delivering a promised 4,000 jobs.<ref name=nozap>Brammer, "Proposal for ZAP Car Plant Idled"</ref> Construction of the proposed plant stalled, however, when [[GE Capital]], a primary investor, pulled out of the project.<ref name=nozap /> ZAP officials maintained their intention to build the plant, but said they would also consider other states' proposals if they could not replace the $125 million commitment from GE.<ref name=nozap />

Beshear clashed with the state [[Council on Postsecondary Education]] over its hiring of Brad Cowgill as its president. Beshear said state law required that the Council conduct a national search for its president and that they hire someone with experience and an established reputation in higher education; he claimed that Cowgill, a Lexington lawyer and state budget director for former Governor Fletcher, was not qualified for the position and that the council hired him without a national search. Democratic Attorney General [[Jack Conway (politician)|Jack Conway]] issued a non-binding opinion that the hiring was illegal under state law, and Cowgill resigned rather than wage a legal battle with Beshear. Beshear, who had considered asking all of the council members to resign or abolishing the council altogether in favor of a new one, praised Cowgill's decision. Democratic House Budget Committee Chairman Harry Moberly said Cowgill "had the council headed in the right direction" and added "I would have been satisfied if Brad had the permanent position, but I do not criticize the governor for the role he had played [in Cowgill's resignation]." Senate President David Williams called Beshear's interference in the matter "unfortunate".<ref>Jester, "Cowgill Resigns Council Post"</ref>

In September 2008, Beshear's administration attempted to seize control of 141 gambling-related [[domain names]] in an attempt to block Kentucky residents from accessing those websites. Beshear claimed the sites were conducting illegal, unregulated gambling operations in the state and providing untaxed competition to the state's horse racing industry. Later that year, a [[Franklin County, Kentucky|Franklin County]] judge ruled that Beshear had the authority to seize the domain names, but the Kentucky Court of Appeals overturned that ruling on appeal. Beshear appealed to the Kentucky Supreme Court, partially on grounds that the web site owners were being represented by gambling associations and players groups who Beshear said had no legal standing in the case. In 2010, the Kentucky Supreme Court agreed with Beshear and ordered the web site owners themselves to appear before the court. As of August 2010, the case was still in adjudication.<ref name=onlinegaming>Musgrave, "Gambling Web Sites' Owners Lose in Court"</ref>

===2009 legislative session===
During the organizational session of the 2009 General Assembly, House Speaker Jody Richards was ousted by House Democrats by a three-vote margin in favor of former [[Floor leader|Majority Leader]] and Attorney General Greg Stumbo.<ref name=stumbo>Brammer, Musgrave, and Cheves, "Stumbo Elected Speaker of the House"</ref> Some speculated that Beshear had personally interfered on behalf of Stumbo, a charge he denied.<ref name=stumbo /> When asked about Beshear's alleged interference, Richards refused to comment.<ref name=stumbo />

Due to the state's worsening economy, the primary issue facing the legislature for the session was a $456 million budget shortfall.<ref name=strongsession>Covington, "Short Session Garners Strong Reviews"</ref> Expanded gambling was again proposed as a possible source of revenue, and a bill to allow [[slot machine]]s at the state's racetracks passed the House Licensing and Occupations Committee, but died in the House Appropriations and Revenue Committee.<ref name=09slots>Patton, "House Panel OKs Bill for Slots at Tracks"</ref> Speaker Stumbo expressed doubt that he had enough votes to pass the measure even if it were brought to the House floor.<ref name=09slots /> Instead, the Assembly passed a series of tax bills to deal with the shortfall.<ref name=strongsession /> The Assembly also began the process of reforming the state's system of [[Educational assessment|school accountability testing]], a move advocated by Beshear.<ref name=strongsession /> Other bills passed during the session revised the state road plan to allocate newly-available [[American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009|federal stimulus funds]], created a program to divert accused [[substance abuse]]rs to treatment before their trials, and created a statewide database for tracking [[payday loan]]s.<ref name=strongsession />

The rules of the House of Representatives required that the final two days of the chamber's session be reserved for overriding any vetoes by the governor. Beshear hoped that the House would [[Suspension of the rules|suspend the rules]], as they had in previous years, in order to consider bills to increase funding to [[public defender]]s, create a transportation authority to oversee bridge-building projects in Louisville and [[Henderson, Kentucky|Henderson]], and provide various economic incentives, including a package intended to lure a [[NASCAR]] [[Sprint Cup Series]] race to [[Kentucky Speedway]]. The House refused to suspend the rules, however, citing its desire to receive legislation in a timely manner in the future.<ref name=ontime>Musgrave and Brammer, "Session Ends by the Rules"</ref> The chamber allowed Beshear's one veto to stand and adjourned a day early.<ref name=ontime />

===Other matters of 2009 and special legislative session===
Following the 2009 legislative session, Attorney General Jack Conway was asked to issue advisory opinions on two gambling-related issues. Republican state senator Damon Thayer asked for an opinion as to whether "instant racing" &ndash; allowing individuals to bet on the outcome of previously-run horse races &ndash; would be allowable under the state constitution.<ref name=thayer>Patton, "Conway Floats Idea for Hybrid Gambling"</ref> Democratic Representative Jody Richards also asked for an advisory opinion as to whether a constitutional amendment was required to allow [[video lottery terminal]]s at the state's racetracks or whether they could be construed as legal under the amendment that allowed a state lottery.<ref name=vlt>"Kentucky AG: Lawmakers Don't Need to Amend Constitution for Gambling". ''The Gleaner''</ref> Critics charged that Conway had a conflict of interest in the matter because his father was a member of the Kentucky Horse Racing Commission, but Conway denied that a conflict existed, and the state Executive Branch Ethics Board refused to take a position unless an official request for an investigation were made.<ref name=coi>Alessi and Blackford, "Conway: No Conflict of Interest in Offering Opinion on Casinos"</ref> Conway subsequently opined in June 2009 that video lottery terminals would be legal if governed by the Kentucky Lottery Corporation and in January 2010 that instant racing would be allowable under the state's [[parimutuel betting]] statutes with a few regulatory changes.<ref name=thayer /><ref name=vlt />

In an effort to cut costs, the [[Kentucky State Police]] announced in May 2009 that it would only offer the state [[driving test]] in [[English language|English]] beginning June 1, 2009. The test had previously been offered in 22 foreign languages, but the state police said that the foreign language versions of the test had not been updated to reflect recent changes to driving laws. Two days later, Beshear announced the reversal of the state police's new policy, saying he was not informed of it and believed it was the wrong thing to do. He promised the foreign language versions of the test would be updated and would continue to be offered.<ref name=dtest>Musgrave and Spears, "Beshear Reverses English-Only Rule"</ref>

In April 2009, Beshear announced a partnership between the University of Kentucky, the [[University of Louisville]], and [[Chicago, Illinois|Chicago]]-based [[Argonne National Laboratory]] to construct a research facility in Lexington to develop advanced battery technologies that could be used to power electric cars.<ref name=batteries>Brammer, "Car Battery Plant to Employ 2,000"</ref> A week later, the [[National Alliance for Advanced Transportation Battery Cell Manufacture]] announced they would locate a battery manufacturing plant in [[Hardin County, Kentucky|Hardin County]], citing the nearby research facility as an incentive for choosing Kentucky over competing sites.<ref name=batteries /> The venture, however, was predicated upon receiving $342 million in federal stimulus funds; in August 2009, those funds were denied, and officials conceded it was unlikely that the plant would be built.<ref name=nobatteries>Abdullah, "Funds Denied for Battery Plant in Ky."</ref>

Beshear called another special legislative session in June 2009 to address another $1 billion shortfall in the state budget.<ref name=twist>Stamper and Brammer, "Special Session Ends With a Twist"</ref> Later, Beshear amended the call to include the economic incentives package that was not approved during the regular session and, in light of Attorney General Conway's opinion on video lottery terminals, a measure to expand gambling in the state by statute.<ref name=twist /> With the threshold lowered from 60 votes for a constitutional amendment to 51 votes for a statute, the House of Representatives passed the expanded gambling bill, but the measure died in the Republican-dominated Senate Appropriations and Revenue Committee by a 10&ndash;5 vote.<ref name=noslots>Alford, "Senate Halts Slots Measure"</ref> The amended budget and the economic incentives bills both passed in the 10-day session.<ref name=twist />

Again unable to get his expanded gambling proposal past the Senate, Beshear attempted to chip away at the Republican majority in that chamber by appointing some Republican senators to lucrative positions in the executive and judicial branches in advance of the 2010 General Assembly.<ref name=kellyjudge>Musgrave, "Beshear Gives Kelly Judgeship"</ref> Shortly after the special session, Beshear named Republican Senator Charlie Borders to the state Public Safety Commission.<ref name=kellyjudge /> That appointment set up a special election for Borders' seat, which was won by Democrat Robin Webb, reducing the Republican majority to 20&ndash;17 with one Independent who usually voted with the Republicans.<ref name=kellyjudge /> Following Webb's victory, Beshear appointed Republican Senator Dan Kelly to a circuit judgeship, but Republicans held on to that seat in a special election.<ref name=higdon>Brammer, "14th Senate Seat Stays in Republican Column"</ref>

===2010 legislative and special sessions===
Early in the 2010 legislative session, Beshear presented his biennial budget proposal to the General Assembly. The state projected a $1.5 billion shortfall for the biennium, and Beshear once again proposed to make up for the shortfall with revenue generated from expanded gambling.<ref name=2010dead>Alessi and Brammer, "Gambling Bills Dead for Session"</ref> Days after Beshear presented the proposal, both House Speaker Stumbo and Senate President Williams declared all gambling legislation "dead" for the session, saying there was no political will in either chamber to pass such legislation ahead of the legislative elections in November.<ref name=2010dead /> The process of crafting a budget consumed the vast majority of the Assembly's time during the session, but legislators reached the constitutionally-mandated end of their session with no agreement.<ref name=2010budget>Musgrave, "Session Ends With No Budget"</ref> Announcing his intent to call a special session to pass a budget and prevent a state government shutdown, Beshear blasted the leadership of both chambers for discarding his budget proposal.<ref name=2010budget /> "[W]riting their own budget would be their 'defining moment'," Beshear said the legislators had claimed.<ref name=2010budget /> "Well, it was. A moment of abject failure."<ref name=2010budget /> Beshear said expanded gambling would not be on the agenda for the special session unless an agreement were reached before the session date.<ref name=2010budget /> In May 2010, legislators reconvened and passed a budget.<ref name=2010ss>Musgrave and Brammer, "Beshear Vetoes 19 Parts of Budget"</ref> Beshear utilized his [[line-item veto]] on 19 items in the budget, claiming they restricted his ability to implement the reduction in executive expenses mandated by the budget.<ref name=2010ss /> Legislators were unable to override the vetoes because the special session had already adjourned.<ref name=2010ss /> 

In July 2010, Beshear announced six mandatory, unpaid [[furlough]] days for most state employees in order to achieve the savings called for by the budget. The state workers' union sued Beshear in August to prevent the furloughs; as of September 2, 2010, the case is still pending. Later in the month, Beshear announced exceptions from the furlough for public safety and mental health care workers.<ref name=furlough>Spears, "Some State Employees Get Exemptions From Furloughs"</ref>

==2011 gubernatorial campaign==
{{main|Kentucky gubernatorial election, 2011}}
On January 26, 2009, Lieutenant Governor Daniel Mongiardo announced that he would seek the Democratic nomination to challenge incumbent Senator [[Jim Bunning]] in the [[United States Senate election in Kentucky, 2010|2010 senatorial election]].<ref name=mongiardosenate>Brammer, "Mongiardo to Run for U.S. Senate"</ref> The move effectively prohibited Mongiardo from running for re-election with Beshear in the 2011 gubernatorial contest.<ref name=mongiardosenate /> On July 19, 2009, Beshear announced that [[Louisville, Kentucky|Louisville]] mayor [[Jerry Abramson]] would replace Mongiardo as his running mate in his re-election campaign.<ref name=abramson>Musgrave, "Beshear Chooses Running Mate"</ref> 

As of September 2, 2010, Beshear's only challenge in the Democratic primary will come from perennial candidate Otis Hensley.<ref name=williamsannc>Brammer, "David Williams and Richie Farmer Form Slate to Seek State's Top Offices"</ref> Senate President David Williams is the most prominent candidate in the Republican primary, which also includes Louisville businessman [[Phil Moffitt]], a favorite of the [[Tea Party Movement]].<ref name=williamsannc /> Perennial candidate Gatewood Galbraith will seek the governorship as an Independent.<ref name=williamsannc />
