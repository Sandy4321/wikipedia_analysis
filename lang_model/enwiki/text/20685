'''Tai''' (born November 4, 1968) is an [[Asian elephant]] best known for playing Bo Tat in the film ''[[Operation Dumbo Drop]]'' (1995), Vera in ''[[Larger than Life (film)|Larger than Life]]'' (1996) and Rosie in ''[[Water for Elephants (film)|Water for Elephants]]'' (2011). Tai is owned by ''Have Trunk Will Travel, Inc.'', a privately funded organization that generates income through elephant rides, shows and events, as well as film and commercial appearances.

==Career==
Tai's first film appearance was a minor role in ''[[Rudyard Kipling's The Jungle Book]]'' in 1994, where she scares off some [[poachers]]. Tai followed this up playing the major role of Bo Tat in ''[[Operation Dumbo Drop]]'' in 1995.<ref name=dumbo/><ref name=abuse>{{cite web |url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/water-elephants-elephant-was-abused-186634 |title='Water for Elephants' Elephant Was Abused in 2005, Says Animal Rights Group |date=May 9, 2011 |work=hollywoodreporter.com |publisher= |accessdate=January 5, 2013}}</ref> The [[American Humane Association]] rated the treatment of animals in the film as acceptable.<ref name=dumbo/> The scene in which Tai is sedated she is actually just obeying her trainers instructions to lie down. The sounds of her snoring in the film is not actually coming from Tai, but was dubbed in during [[post-production]]. All scenes that show Tai in danger were carefully staged, and the boat in which she travels in the film was pre-tested to make sure it would support her 8,000 pound weight. To ensure she remained healthy, all of Tai's food, drinking water, and even  her bathing water, was shipped from the U.S. to [[Thailand]], where filming was taking place.<ref name=dumbo/>

Tai played the major role of Vera in the 1996 comedy ''[[Larger than Life (film)|Larger than Life]]'' alongside [[Bill Murray]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19961101/REVIEWS/611010303/1023 |title=Larger Than Life |last1=Ebert |first1=Roger |date=November 1, 1996 |work=rogerebert.suntimes.com |publisher= |accessdate=January 5, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9F05EEDC1139F932A35752C1A960958260 |title=Larger Than Life (1996) |last1=Holden |first1=Stephen |date=November 1, 1996 |work=[[The New York Times]] |publisher= |accessdate=January 5, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.reelviews.net/movies/l/larger.html |title=Larger Than Life |last1=Berardinelli |first1=James |year=1996 |work=reelviews.net |publisher= |accessdate=January 5, 2013}}</ref> and had a minor role in ''[[George of the Jungle (film)|George of the Jungle]]''  in 1997, where she can be seen being ridden by [[Brendan Fraser]] and [[Leslie Mann]].

Tai's performance in ''[[Water for Elephants (film)|Water for Elephants]]'' in 2011 was praised.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.empireonline.com/reviews/reviewcomplete.asp?FID=137097 |title=Water For Elephants |last1=Errigo |first1=Angie |date= |work=[[Empire (film magazine)]] |publisher= |accessdate=January 5, 2013}}</ref> It was the second time Tai, [[Reese Witherspoon]] and [[Robert Pattinson]] had all worked on the same film, as all three had been filmed in ''[[Vanity Fair (2004 film)|Vanity Fair]]'' in 2004, though Pattison's part was edited out of the final cut.<ref name=yahoo>{{cite web |url=http://movies.yahoo.com/photos/five-film-facts-water-for-elephants-slideshow-3377/five-film-facts-water-elephants-titlecard-58634.html |title=Five Film Facts: 'Water for Elephants' |date= |work=[[Yahoo!

One of Tai's paintings as well as an autographed poster for ''Water for Elephants'' was auctioned off on [[eBay]] to raise awareness of [[elephant endotheliotropic herpesvirus]].<ref name=yahoo/> The money Tai raised from the auction was given to the [http://www.elephantconservation.org International Elephant Foundation] (IEF) which distributed it to the appropriate labs and research facilities actively working to find a cure for EEHV.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.elephantconservation.org/2012-elephant-conservation-and-research-funding-support/ |title=2012 Elephant Conservation and Research Funding Support |date= |work=elephantconservation.org |publisher= |accessdate=10 January 2013}}</ref>

==Controversy==
In 2008 Tai, along with Kitty, another elephant owned by ''Have Trunk Will Travel'', appeared in [[Britney Spears]] music video ''[[Circus (song)|Circus]]''. Animal rights organization [[People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals]] (PETA) issued a press release condemning Spears for using "cruelly trained lions and elephants". ''Have Trunk Will Travel'' responded, saying, "A representative [from the [[American Humane Association]]] was on the set of the Britney Spears 'Circus' video with our elephants, Tai and Kitty, to ensure their safety and welfare [...] Britney, the director, producers and the entire crew were respectful of the elephants' needs and comfort and a pleasure to work with."<ref name=mtvpeta>{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1600992/20081209/spears_britney.jhtml|title=Britney Spears' 'Circus' Video Taken To Task By PETA, But Trainers Insist Animals Were Treated Well|date=December 9, 2008 |accessdate=January 5, 2013|last=Montgomery|first=James|work=MTV|publisher=MTV Networks}}</ref>

In 2009 Tai appeared in the [[Banksy]] film ''[[Exit Through the Gift Shop]]'' as part of his 2006 ''Barely Legal'' art show for which she was painted pink and gold<ref>{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/5344676.stm |title='Guerrilla artist' Banksy hits LA |last1=Bowes |first1=Peter |date=September 14, 2006 |work=[[BBC]] |publisher= |accessdate=January 5, 2013}}</ref> with non-toxic paint. PETA called the display animal cruelty.<ref name=yahoo/>

===Water for Elephants===
In the film ''[[Water for Elephants (film)|Water for Elephants]]'' the elephant Rosie, who Tai portrays, is severely abused. A spokesperson from the AHA assured people that all scenes of abuse in the film were the work of special effects and [[Computer-generated imagery|CGI]], and that the moaning and crying sounds that Tai is seen making on film were audio tracks, and were not actually made by Tai.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://today.msnbc.msn.com/id/42721808/ns/today-entertainment/t/was-elephants-pachyderm-treated-humanely-set/#.UOo5WaUZ4dI |title=Was 'Elephant's' pachyderm treated humanely on set? |date=April 22, 2011 |work=[[MSNBC]] |publisher= |accessdate=January 5, 2013}}</ref>

Controversy erupted, however, regarding concerns Tai was mistreated prior to filming.<ref name=abuse/><ref name=daily/> A video released by the [[Animal Defenders International]] (ADI) in 2011 shows footage of Tai allegedly being shocked with handheld stun guns and beaten around the body and legs with bull hooks, while in the care of ''Have Trunk Will Travel'' in 2005. The ADI contacted AHA, urging them to re-evaluate how they assess the use of animals in films and the statements being made which effectively endorse the use of performing animals.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ad-international.org/animals_in_entertainment/go.php?id=2119&ssi=7 |title=Movie Star Electric Shocked |date=May 7, 2011 |work=[[Animal Defenders International|ADI]] |accessdate=January 5, 2013}}</ref><ref name=daily>{{cite web |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1384426/Water-Elephants-star-electrocuted-beaten-hooks-Shocking-new-video-shows-mistreatment.html |title=Given electric shocks and beaten with hooks: Shocking new video shows mistreatment of Water For Elephants star Tai |date=May 10, 2011 |work=[[Daily Mail]] |publisher= |accessdate=January 5, 2013}}</ref>

''Have Trunk Will Travel'' responded to the video stating, "The video shows heavily edited and very short snippets, obviously taken surreptitiously six years ago, purporting mistreatment of our elephants. If there was truly any abuse going on why wait six minutes, much less six years?" and added "None of the footage being shown was taken during Tai's training for Water for Elephants."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2011/may/10/water-for-elephants-abuse-claims |title=Elephant trainers accused of abusing animal star of Water for Elephants |last1=Griffiths |first1=Ian J |date=May 10, 2011 |work=[[The Guardian]] |publisher= |accessdate=January 5, 2013}}</ref>

===Zookeeper===
When the 2011 film ''[[Zookeeper (film)|Zookeeper]]'' was released, PETA protested against alleged animal cruelty in the film's production.<ref name=huff>{{cite web |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/07/09/zookeeper-premiere-picket-peta_n_893996.html |title='Zookeeper' Premiere Picketed By PETA, Critiqued By Film Critics |date=July 10, 2011 |work=[[The Huffington Post]] |publisher= |accessdate=January 5, 2013}}</ref><ref name=denied>{{cite web |url=http://insidemovies.ew.com/2011/07/07/zookeeper-peta-protests/ |title=PETA protests at 'Zookeeper' premiere.
