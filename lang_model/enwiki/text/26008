== History ==
By 1997, there were calls within the United Nations and to draw all UN development agencies together. The UNDP was already the leading UN development agency in leading UN system-wide operational activities.<ref>Stokke,O., 2009, The UN and Development: From Aid to Cooperation, Bloomington and Indianapolis: Indiana University Press, pg.401</ref> An initial proposal was to merge the [[UNICEF]], the [[World Food Programme]] and the [[UNFPA]] into the UNDP.<ref>Sadik, N. in Murphy, C.N., 2005 The United Nations Development Programme: A Better Way?, Cambridge, Cambridge University Press, pg.292</ref> However, it was noted that the UNDP was still the UN's largest operational development cooperation body.<ref>Klingebiel, S., 1998, Effectiveness and Reform of the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), Germant Development Institute Book Series 13, Berlin: Germant Development Institute, p.71</ref> More support came from Surapong Posayanond, the then Director General of the Department of International Organizations from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Thailand in merging UNDP, UNICEF, UNFPA and WFP together.<ref>UN Economic and Social Council reviews operational activities for fostering development, M2 Presswire, 4 July 1997</ref> Finally, then Secretary General [[Kofi Annan]] worked to form the UNDG and won praise from then UNDP Administrator [[James Speth]].<ref>UNDP Head Praises Annan's Reform Proposals, Xinhua News Agency, 16 July 1997</ref><ref>UN Secretary-General pledges 'quiet revolution' in UN, presents reform proposals to General Assembly, M2 Presswire, 17 July 1997</ref><ref>Remarks By U.N.
