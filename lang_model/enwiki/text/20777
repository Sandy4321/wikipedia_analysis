'''Craig-y-Nos Castle''' ''('''English:''' Rock of the Night),'' is a Victorian-Gothic [[country house]] in Wales. Built on parkland beside the [[River Tawe]] in the upper [[Swansea Valley]], it is located on the southern edge of [[Fforest Fawr]] in [[Powys]]. The former estate of opera singer [[Adelina Patti]], part of the complex is now used as a [[boutique hotel]], catering, conferencing and entertainment venue. The castle grounds are surrounded by a designated [[country park]], which is now part of the [[Brecon Beacons]] [[National Park]].

==Penwyllt==
The industrial development of the village of [[Penwyllt]], came as a result of the need for [[Calcium oxide|quicklime]] in the industrial processes in the lower Swansea Valley. Quarrying [[clay]] from the surrounding hills, in total there were fifteen [[lime kiln]]s turning it into quicklime within the parish of Penwyllt:
*'''Craig-y-nos:''' two lime kilns created in the railway age, dated 1878.<ref>http://www.brocross.com/industrial%20history/welsh%20limekilns/powys/craig-y-nos.htm</ref>
*'''Pen-y-Foel:''' a bank of four kilns erected in around 1863 to 1867 by, it is thought, the Brecon Coal & Lime Co. There is a loading bank for railway wagons in front of the kilns.<ref>http://www.brocross.com/industrial%20history/welsh%20limekilns/powys/pen-y-foel%20kilns.htm</ref>
*'''Twyn-disgwylfa:''' Built by [[Joseph Claypon]] between 1836 and 1842, this bank of seven kilns has been largely destroyed by quarry tipping. Only one draw arch can now be seen.<ref>http://www.brocross.com/industrial%20history/welsh%20limekilns/powys/twyn-disgwylfa.htm</ref>
*'''Twyn-y-ffald:''' The 1825 and 1827 kilns built by Joseph Claypon have been largely demolished, although the single draw arch can still be seen.<ref>http://www.brocross.com/industrial%20history/welsh%20limekilns/powys/twyn-y-ffald.htm</ref>

==History==

===Powell family===
The main building was built during the period 1841 - 1843 by Captain Rice Davies Powell, who became a county magistrate and a High Sheriff of Brecknock. It was said that his family were cursed thanks to their bloodline relationship with the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] Overbeek family of [[Calcutta]] and [[Cape Town]], with [[cholera]] taking his younger son in 1851, and the deaths of his wife and younger daughter before he died in 1862. In 1864 his eldest son was killed in a hunting accident on the [[Isle of Wight]]. This resulted in eldest daughter Sarah's inheriting the estate, and she moved in with her husband Captain Allaway. After Allaway died in 1875, Sarah moved to [[Tenby]], before the property was sold in 1876.<ref name=paranormalworld.net/>

===Morgan Morgan===
After the estate entered into the trust of the Chancery, it was bought by Morgan Morgan of [[Abercrave]] for <U+00A3>6000 in 1876. Mr Morgan and his family, plus his son also called Morgan Morgan and his family, lived jointly in the castle for several years. The family cleared a large plantation of 80 year old [[fir tree]]s which stood between the castle and the quarries above, which were said to be home to a local population of [[red squirrel]]s.<ref name=paranormalworld.net/>

==Adelina Patti==
[[Image:Adelina Patti..jpg|right|thumbnail|[[Adelina Patti]]]]
Adelina Patti purchased the castle and surrounding park land for <U+00A3>3500 in 1878,<ref name=paranormalworld.net/> to develop it as her own private estate. The [[prima donna]] had reached the soaring heights of a spectacular career. She spent the rest of her life at Craig-y-nos, leaving it only to sing in the premier opera houses of Europe and to tour the United States, captivating the world with her flawless [[soprano]] voice.

After her second marriage, to French [[tenor]] [[Ernesto Nicolini]], she embarked on a major building program at the castle, adding the North and South wings, the clock tower, conservatory, winter garden and theatre.<ref name=OSadelina2/> After making her last public appearance in October 1914, when she sang for the [[Red Cross]] and filled the [[Albert Hall]], she spent the rest of her life at Craig-y-nos with her third husband and a devoted staff.<ref name=paranormalworld.net/>

===Adelina Patti Theatre===
The Adelina Patti Theatre is a [[Listed building|Grade I listed]] [[opera house]]. Built to be Patti's own private auditorium, it was designed by Swansea architects Bucknall and Jennings, with input from [[Henry Irving|Sir Henry Irving]].<ref name=DayLife>http://a-day-in-the-life.powys.org.uk/eng/cult/eu_ptheat.php</ref> Briefed by Patti to be her miniature version of [[La Scala]], [[Milan]], it incorporates features from Wagner's [[Bayreuth Festspielhaus]] opera house in [[Bayreuth]],<ref name=DayLife/> and the [[Theatre Royal, Drury Lane]], London.<ref name=OSadelina2/>

At {{convert|40|ft|m}} long, {{convert|26|ft|m}} wide and {{convert|24|ft|m}} high the auditorium was originally decorated in pale blue, cream and gold wall panels.<ref name=DayLife/> Ten [[Corinthian column]]s support the ceiling, and in between these are the names of composers such as [[Mozart]], [[Verdi]] and [[Rossini]], all [[gilded]] and surmounted by Madam Patti's monogram.<ref name=DayLife/> The stage area was originally fronted by blue silk curtains, with a back drop that illustrates Madam Patti riding in a [[chariot]], dressed as ''[[Semiramide]]'' from the opera of the same name by Rossini. The design incorporates a mechanical auditorium floor which can be: raised level, for use as a [[ballroom]]; or sloped towards the stage, when in use as a theatre.<ref name=DayLife/> The theatre incorporated an organ, given to Patti in the United States after one of her tours. This was dismantled in the 1920s when the buildings became a hospital.<ref name=DayLife/>

Able to seat 150 people, the back of the theatre houses a gallery where the domestic staff would sit, enabling them to enjoy the performances. The orchestra pit is separated from the seating area by a [[balustrade]], and holds up to 24 musicians.<ref name=DayLife/>

Invitations for the July 12, 1891, opening event went to two types of guest: those invited to stay at the castle, and those invited just for the performance. House guests included: the Spanish Ambassador; [[Paul Reuter|Baron and Baroness Julius De Reuter]], founder of the [[Reuters]] [[news agency]]; and [[Henry Vivian, 1st Baron Swansea|Baron Henry and Lady Vivian Hussey Vivian Bart]]. Journalists from international newspapers including ''[[The Daily Telegraph]], [[Le Figaro]]'' and the ''[[Boston Herald]]'' were also invited as house guests to report on the opening.<ref name=DayLife/> Final rehearsals occurred in the afternoon with the Swansea Opera Company, before a specially chartered train arrived at Penwyllt with the performance guests. Due to start at 20:00, the performance eventually started at 20:30 after a light tea. Sir Henry Irving was to have given the opening address, but as he was unable to attend, leading actor [[William Terris]] deputised.<ref name=paranormalworld.net/> Patti's performance included the prelude to act one of ''[[La traviata]]'', and in the second half the Garden Scene from ''[[Faust (opera)|Faust]].'' There then followed a buffet supper served in the conservatory, with a total of 450 bottles of [[Champagne (wine)|champagne]] consumed at the party.<ref name=DayLife/>

Today the theatre remains a time capsule, and the stage is probably the only surviving example of original 19th century backstage equipment.<ref name=OSadelina2/> The opera house is licensed for weddings, and is still occasionally used for public performances.

===Winter garden===
[[File:Patti Pavilion, Victoria Park, St. Helen's, Swansea, 2009.jpg|thumb|300px|The [[Patti Pavilion]], [[Swansea]] after refurbishment, 2009]]
{{main|Patti Pavilion}}
The [[winter garden]] is a spacious building with a soaring roof and made mainly from glass, where Patti would promenade with her guests among tropical plants, whilst exotic birds flew within.

A pair of [[wrought iron]] [[water fountain]]s in the shape of [[Crane (bird)|Cranes]] were made in the local ironworks by a Mr Crane, who made decorative ironware featuring his namesake bird.<ref name=OSadelina2>http://www.opera-singer.co.uk/adelina2.htm</ref> Their multi-coloured plumage shed rainbow light from their falling waters, and were said to have captivated all who saw them.<ref name=paranormalworld.net/>

As a result of [[World War I]], in 1918, Patti presented her winter garden to the people of Swansea where it became the [[Patti Pavilion]], and has since been restored on several occasions. One of the crane fountains stands in the forecourt of the castle,<ref name=OSadelina2/> the other in the grounds of [[Swansea University]].

===Electricity===
Craig-y-nos was probably the first private house in Wales to be wired for [[electricity]].<ref name=OSadelina2/> The first in the UK was [[Cragside]] in [[Northumberland]] in 1880, a year after the invention of the [[electric light bulb]] by [[Thomas Edison]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.buildingconservation.com/articles/lighting/lighting.htm|title=Lighting in the Victorian Home|author=Jonathan Taylor|publisher=buildingconservation.com|accessdate=July 17, 2010}}</ref> An [[Otto engine]] in the grounds created a 110&nbsp;V [[Direct current|DC]] system, with distribution provided by two bare [[copper]] wires placed in two adjacent grooves carved into a plank of wood, with a second plank placed over the top of it. This supplied power for [[Joseph Swan|Swan lamps]] throughout the castle, and an electrically powered orchestra organ which was controlled by a punched paper roll, situated in the [[French billiards]] room.<ref name=OSadelina2/> The organ was the pride and joy of her second husband, French tenor Nicolini, thus dating installation prior to his death in 1898.<ref name=paranormalworld.net/> Discovery and investigation into the system was only found by Mr J. A. Lea, the last Hospital Secretary.<ref name=paranormalworld.net/>

===Transport===
The [[Neath and Brecon Railway]] [[railway station]] at Craig-y-nos/Penwyllt was in part funded by Patti.<ref>http://history.powys.org.uk/history/ystrad/craig1.html</ref> A private road was constructed from the castle to the station, where a lavishly furnished private waiting room was installed. In return the Neath and Brecon Railway was commissioned to provide Patti with her own private [[railway carriage]], which she could request attached to any train to take her whenever, and wherever within the United Kingdom, she wanted to travel.<ref name=OSadelina2/>

At the start of the 20th century, Patti had one of the first motor cars in Wales, and is reported to have raced a local doctor from Swansea to Abercrave for a small wager.<ref name=OSadelina2/>

==Hospital==
After Adelina Patti's death in 1919, the castle and the grounds were sold to the Welsh National Memorial Trust for <U+00A3>11,000 in March 1921, an organisation founded to combat [[tuberculosis]] in Wales. Reconstructed as a [[sanatorium]] and called the '''Adelina Patti Hospital''' at the request of her widower, it admitted its first patients in August 1922. In 1947, the children of Craig-y-nos were among the first in the UK to receive the first effective TB medicine, the [[antibiotic]] [[streptomycin]].<ref name=BBC6984547/> In 1959, it became a hospital for the elderly. The castle closed as a hospital on 31 March 1986, after the transfer of remaining patients to the new [[community hospital]] at [[Ystradgynlais]].

In a project supported by the [[Heritage Lottery Fund]], the Sleeping Giant Foundation charity, the [[Wellcome Trust|Wellcome Trust Centre]] and [[University College of London]], in 2007 an exhibition at the Welfare Hall, Ystradgynlais, showed relics and recorded recalls of patients from its time as a TB sanatorium.<ref name=BBC6984547>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/wales/south_west/6984547.stm|title=Photos reveal castle's TB history|publisher=BBC Wales|date=September 8, 2007|accessdate=July 17, 2010}}</ref>

==Present day==
The [[Welsh Office]] maintained Craig-y-nos Castle and its unique theatre, until the castle was bought on a long term lease by a consortium of businessmen who formed the Craig y Nos Castle Company. During the long period of restoration, the castle remained open to the public, but after its sale to SelClene Ltd this ended. SelClene continued the restoration, and opened the castle as a hotel.

In 2005, the castle featured in the [[BBC]] ''[[Dr Who]]'' episode ''[[Tooth and Claw (Doctor Who)|Tooth and Claw]]'', featuring [[David Tennant]] as the Doctor and [[Billie Piper]] as [[Rose Tyler]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/wales/arts/sites/doctor-who-wales/alllocations/swansea-valley-craig-y-nos-castle|title=Craig-y-Nos Castle, Swansea Valley|publisher=BBC Wales|date=September 28, 2005|accessdate=July 17, 2010}}</ref> The ''[[Torchwood]]'' crew later stayed at this hotel and filmed some scenes when filming ''[[Countrycide]].''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.doctorwholocations.net/locations/craigynoscastlehotel|title=Craig-y-Nos Castle, Swansea Valley|publisher=doctorwholocations.net|date=September 28, 2005|accessdate=July 17, 2010}}

==Haunting==
The castle is said to be subject to strong paranormal phenomena and haunted by the ghosts of Patti, her second husband, French tenor Nicolini, and the object of her affection, the composer [[Rossini]]. Unexplained presences taking many different forms have been experienced by visitors all over the castle. Nurses who worked at Craig-y-nos while it was a hospital have reported many presences and frequent reports of having walked past somebody on the stairs or corridor but nobody being there, as well as many unexplained noises and sounds of footsteps. Visitors have also reported experiencing breathing difficulties and of feeling a lingering presence of patients who were hospitalized there while suffering from tuberculosis. On one occasion a film crew were recording an interview in the theatre, and while in the kitchen they were discussing the fact that Adelina Patti had never mastered the role of Carmen. Suddenly a heavy saucepan, which had been placed on a large cooker, far enough away from the edge, flew onto the floor.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/wales/mid/sites/weird/pages/gaynor.shtml|title=Ghostly Arias|publisher=BBC Wales|accessdate=July 17, 2010}}</ref>

The Top Children's Ward is the most active room in the castle. With the recovery rate of TB being so low, many children entered the castle at an extremely young age and never left. Many full apparitions have been seen in this room and have interacted on numerous occasions. Again, minor anomalies are regular occurrences, along with the sounds of children's footsteps, bouncing balls and giggles.<ref name=paranormalworld.net>http://www.theparanormalworld.net/ghostcam/html/craigynos.htm</ref>

An investigation of an alleged dark semi-transparent lady on the stairs was discovered to be that of a [[statuette]], which is situated on the roof of the castle, it casts a shadow that resembles a lady when the sun starts to set.<ref name=paranormalworld.net/> The building was also subject to an investigation on [[Sky Living|Living TV]]'s ''[[Most Haunted]]''.
