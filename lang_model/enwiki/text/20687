'''Ivan Shishman''' ({{lang-bg|<U+0418><U+0432><U+0430><U+043D> <U+0428><U+0438><U+0448><U+043C><U+0430><U+043D>}}) ruled as emperor ([[tsar]]) of [[Bulgaria]] in [[Veliko Tarnovo|Tarnovo]] 1371<U+2013>1395.  He was born about 1350/1, and was executed on June 3, 1395.

==Life==
Ivan Shishman was the eldest son of [[Ivan Alexander of Bulgaria]] and his second wife Theodora, a [[Jew]]ess converted to the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]].  Either because of his mother's intrigues or because of being born first after his father's accession to the throne, Ivan Shishman became the preferred heir and was crowned co-emperor in or shortly before 1356.  This caused the effective secession of Ivan Shishman's older half-brother, [[Ivan Stratsimir of Bulgaria|Ivan Sratsimir]] (Ivan Sracimir) in [[Vidin]].  Together with his father and younger brother Ivan Asen V, Ivan Shishman presided over the church synods at Tarnovo in the late 1360s.

After the death of Ivan Alexander in early 1371, Ivan Shishman inherited the central portion of Bulgaria with the capital Tarnovo.  Ivan Sratsimir of Vidin and Dobrotitsa/Dobrotici of [[Dobruja|Dobrudzha]] were completely independent.  Although in 1371 [[Wallachia]] still recognized the suzerainty of Ivan Alexander as seen in a request concerning commercial, in 1386, during an obscure war in which Ivan Shishman defeated and killed [[Dan I of Wallachia]], it was probably already independent. That year, Ivan Shishman had attacked [[Ivanko]], the new [[Despot (court title)|despot]] of Dobrudzha, who was the nephew of Dan I, but although he killed Ivanko's ally, he didn't manage to bring Dobdruja under his influence.

The reign of Ivan Shishman is inextricably connected with the fall of Bulgaria under [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] domination.  Shortly after Ivan Shishman came to the throne, the united forces of the Serbian nobles led by King [[Vuka<U+0161>in Mrnjav<U+010D>evi<U+0107>]] were defeated by the Ottoman Turks in the [[Battle of Maritsa|battle of <U+010C>ernomen]] on September 26, 1371.  The Ottomans advanced on Bulgaria, and Ivan Shishman was forced to recognize Ottoman overlordship and to send his sister Thamar (Kera Tamara) as a spouse for Sultan [[Murad I|Murat I]] by 1373.

In spite of this capitulation, the Ottomans continued their conquest of Bulgaria, with the fall of [[Ihtiman]] in 1378, [[Sofia]] in 1383 and [[Ni<U+0161>]] in 1385.  Encouraged by the Serbian and Bosnian victory over the Ottomans at the [[Battle of Plo<U+010D>nik]] in 1387, Ivan Shishman refused to support Murat I or to recognize his suzerainty. The Ottoman reprisal was swift, and the enemy overran the Bulgarian defenses, besieging Ivan Shishman in [[Nikopol, Bulgaria|Nikopol]] on the [[Danube]] in 1388.  Ivan Shishman had no choice but to submit, and was allowed to keep most of his realm, but was required to surrender Drastar ([[Silistra]]) to the Ottoman Sultan.  Ivan Shishman tried to go back on his promises, and found himself besieged in Nikopol again, surrendered Drastar, and allowed the introduction of Ottoman garrisons in other important fortresses.  

In spite of the murder of Sultan Murat I before the [[Battle of Kosovo]] in 1389, the Ottomans crushed the Christian coalition, and could turn their attention more closely to Ivan Shishman.  In 1393 the new Sultan [[Bayezid I|Bayezit I]] invaded Bulgaria unexpectedly and besieged the capital Tarnovo.  The capital was defended under the supervision of the Bulgarian [[Patriarch Evtimiy]], while Ivan Shishman had taken refuge in Nikopol once more.  After a siege of three months, Tarnovo fell by treason on July 17, 1393, a point sometimes taken as the end of the [[Second Bulgarian Empire]], although both Ivan Shishman and Ivan Sratsimir survived.

Ivan Shishman continued to rule in Nikopol as an Ottoman vassal, and perhaps counted on the imminent anti-Ottoman crusade prepared by the Hungarian king [[Sigismund, Holy Roman Emperor|Sigismund]] of Luxemburg.  Returning from a failed campaign against [[Mircea cel B<U+0103>tr<U+00E2>n of Wallachia|Mircea I]] of Wallachia, Sultan Bayezit I had Ivan Shishman beheaded at Nikopol on June 3, 1395.  The remainder of Ivan Shishman's territory was annexed by the Ottoman Empire, while Bulgarian emperors continued to rule at Vidin until 1422.

Folklore tradition (legends and songs) presents Ivan Shishman's exploits and death as the heroic deeds of the last emperor of Bulgaria but Ivan Shishman was in fact survived by his half-brother Ivan Sratsimir in Vidin and the latter's son [[Constantine II of Bulgaria|Constantine II]].  Although it cannot be denied that Ivan Shishman was a far more energetic ruler than Ivan Sratsimir, there is little evidence for his heroism in historical sources.  In them he appears as a vacillating politician whose inopportune choices speedily guided him to his violent end and the subjugation of the country by the enemy. This judgment has the natural benefit of hindsight, and the decline of the Second Bulgarian Kingdom was hardly entirely Ivan Shishman's doing.

==Family==
Ivan Shishman was married first to a Bulgarian named Kera Marija, who died in the early 1380s.  He married as his second wife Dragana, a daughter of prince [[Prince Lazar|Lazar I]] of Serbia.  From either of his marriages, Ivan Shishman had several children, including:
# Alexander (''Aleksand<U+0103>r''), who converted to [[Islam]] under the name Iskender, and died as governor of [[Samsun]] in 1418
# [[Fruzhin]] (''Fru<U+017E>in''), who participated in revolts and campaigns against Ottoman rule, and died in [[Hungary]] after 1444, perhaps in 1460.  Fruzhin had a son named Shishman.

==Honour==
[[Shishman Peak]] on [[Livingston Island]] in the [[South Shetland Islands]], [[Antarctica]] is named after Ivan Shishman of Bulgaria.
