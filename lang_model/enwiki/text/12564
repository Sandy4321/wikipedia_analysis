'''Damian Spinelli''' is a fictional character on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]'s daytime drama ''[[General Hospital]]''. He has been played on a [[recurring]] basis by [[Bradford Anderson]] since [[November 13]], [[2006]], and will also be one of the characters in the summer 2007 run of ''[[General Hospital: Night Shift]]''.<ref> http://www.soaps.com/generalhospital/news/696/General_Hospital_Night_Shift_Cast_Announced</ref>

==Background==
In September 2006, ''General Hospital'' put out a casting call for a "college-aged kid" who was a cross between [[Seth Green]] and Spicoli, a character played by [[Sean Penn]] in ''[[Fast Times at Ridgemont High]]''.  The part was won by Anderson, who says he tries to emulate Spicoli's speaking style when playing the character.  Spinelli's dialogue, a rapid-fire mix of [[surf culture|surfer lingo]] and [[internet slang]], has offered comic relief, and an unusual "tech-savvy" character to the show, that has been called "one of the quirkiest characters daytime has ever seen."<ref name=hero>Kelli M. Larson, "A different kind of hero," ''[[ABC Soaps in Depth]]'', May 22, 2007</ref> Anderson says that he generally doesn't improvise the part, instead sticking to the script that is supplied a couple days before filming.  The name of the specific writer or writers who create Spinelli's dialogue have not been identified.<ref>[http://www.fosters.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20070128/NEWS1403/101280109 "Local actor makes the grade: Meredith native Bradford Anderson lands recurring role on daytime soap"], January 28, 2007, ''Foster's Daily Democrat''</ref>

==Future plans==
The character has proved popular<ref>[http://blogcritics.org/archives/2007/02/26/150634.php "Making the Rounds at General Hospital"], February 26, 2007, ''Blogcritics Magazine''</ref> and actor Bradford Anderson has reportedly been offered a contract, but it is not yet known if he will accept,<ref>[http://soapzone.com/newsroom.php/gh/news/26-Feb-2007 February 26, 2007 news], soapzone.com</ref> at least for the daytime version of the program. In April 2007, it was announced that he will be one of the crossover actors appearing in the Summer 2007 season of [[General Hospital: Night Shift]]. Taping started on [[April 20]], and the 13-episode series will premiere in July 2007. The storylines will reportedly be separate between the shows, with no overlap.<ref>http://www.soaps.com/generalhospital/news/696/General_Hospital_Night_Shift_Cast_Announced</ref>

==Character storyline==
Damian Spinelli was introduced in 2006 as the computer hacker responsible for creating a [[flash drive]] containing falsified evidence against [[Sam McCall]]. Spinelli had been hired by [[Lorenzo Alcazar]] to create the flash drive, which in turn was handed over to corrupt Port Charles District Attorney, [[Ric Lansing]], who had a grudge against McCall's beau [[Jason Morgan]]. Jason and Sam ended up finding Spinelli and were able to convince him to confess to creating the flash drive. Spinelli agreed, and hid at a safe house with Sam while Jason waited for the right time to make his move. But before this could happen, they were ambushed by Alcazar's hitmen. In the ensuing fracas, Spinelli disappeared. 

He reappeared a short time later, working in a study group with [[Lulu Spencer]]. The two were kidnapped by Alcazar, who was planning to kill them, but they were rescued by Jason. Spinelli ran again, but Lulu was able to help Jason track him down at Spinelli's grandmother's house in the (fictional) city of Oakfield, Tennessee (the part of Spinelli's grandmother, Miriam Spinelli, was played by [[Emmy Award]]-winning actress [[Bonnie Bartlett]], of ''[[St. Elsewhere]]'' fame). 

Spinelli was convinced to return to Port Charles, and provided [[Mac Scorpio]] with the evidence to exonerate Sam. Since then he has helped Jason and [[Sonny Corinthos]] keep tabs on Alcazar; is helping Lulu to prove that her mother, [[Laura Spencer]] did not kill Rick Webber; and provided an ailing [[Alexis Davis]] with [[marijuana]] to ease the pain caused by her [[chemotherapy]] treatments for [[lung cancer]]. 

In the [[24 (TV series)|''24'']]-inspired storyline during the February 2007 [[sweeps]], Spinelli helped as Jason Morgan's sidekick in an attempt to rescue the hostages who were being held at the MetroCourt Hotel. It was also revealed that he has a major crush on [[Lulu Spencer]], and that he has a very vivid [[Walter Mitty]]-like imagination.  

The current storyline portrays Spinelli as one of a trio of a young men (Spinelli, [[Dillon Quartermaine]], and [[Milo Giambetti]]) that are attempting to court Lulu. Spinelli is also coming into conflict with a hacker rival, [[Stan Johnson]] ([[Kiko Ellsworth]]) who has threatened to "run a [[computer virus|tapeworm]]" on Spinelli's secret Chicago servers.
