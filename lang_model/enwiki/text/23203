'''''Robinson Crusoe''''' {{IPAc-en|<U+02CC>|r|<U+0252>|b|<U+026A>|n|s|<U+0259>n|_|<U+02C8>|k|r|u<U+02D0>|s|o<U+028A>}} is a novel by [[Daniel Defoe]] that was first published in 1719. [[Epistolary novel|Epistolary]], [[Confessional writing|confessional]], and [[Didacticism|didactic]] in form, the book is a fictional autobiography of the title character (whose real name is Robinson Kreutznaer)<U+2014>a [[castaway]] who spends 28 years on a remote tropical island near [[Trinidad]], encountering [[cannibals]], captives, and mutineers before being rescued.

The story was perhaps influenced by [[Alexander Selkirk]], a Scottish castaway who lived for four years on the Pacific island called "M<U+00E1>s a Tierra" (in 1966 its name was changed to [[Robinson Crusoe Island]]), Chile. The details of Crusoe's island were probably based on the Caribbean island of [[Tobago]], since that island lies a short distance north of the Venezuelan coast near the mouth of the [[Orinoco]] river, in sight of [[Trinidad]].<ref>''Robinson Crusoe'', Chapter 23.</ref> It is possible that Defoe was inspired by the Latin or English translations of [[Ibn Tufail]]'s ''[[Hayy ibn Yaqdhan]]'', an earlier novel also set on a [[desert island]].<ref>Nawal Muhammad Hassan (1980), ''Hayy bin Yaqzan and Robinson Crusoe: A study of an early Arabic impact on English literature'', Al-Rashid House for Publication.</ref><ref>Cyril Glasse (2001), ''New [[Encyclopedia of Islam]]'', p. 202, Rowman Altamira, ISBN 0-7591-0190-6.</ref><ref name=Amber>Amber Haque (2004), "Psychology from Islamic Perspective: Contributions of Early Muslim Scholars and Challenges to Contemporary Muslim Psychologists", ''Journal of Religion and Health'' '''43''' (4): 357<U+2013>377 [369].</ref><ref name=Wainwright>Martin Wainwright, [http://books.guardian.co.uk/review/story/0,12084,918454,00.html Desert island scripts], ''[[The Guardian]]'', 22 March 2003.</ref> Another source for Defoe's novel may have been [[Robert Knox (sailor)|Robert Knox]]'s account of his abduction by the King of [[Sri Lanka|Ceylon]] in 1659 in "An Historical Account of the Island Ceylon," Glasgow: James MacLehose and Sons (Publishers to the University), 1911.<ref name=Filreis>see Alan Filreis</ref> 

==Full title==
Although commonly referred to as simply ''Robinson Crusoe,'' the book<U+2019>s complete, original title as it appears on the title page of the first edition is ''The Life and Strange Surprizing Adventures of Robinson Crusoe, of York, Mariner: Who lived Eight and Twenty Years, all alone in an un<U+2010>inhabited Island on the Coast of America, near the Mouth of the Great River of Oroonoque; Having been cast on Shore by Shipwreck, wherein all the Men perished but himself. With An Account how he was at last as strangely deliver'd by Pirates''.

==Plot summary==
[[Image:Robinson.Crusoe.island.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Pictorial map of Crusoe's island, aka "Island of Despair," showing incidents from the book]]
Crusoe (the family name corrupted from the German name "Kreutznaer") sets sail from the [[Queen's Gardens, Hull|Queen's Dock]] in [[Kingston upon Hull|Hull]] on a sea voyage in August 1651, against his parents' wishes, who want him to pursue a career, possibly in law. After a tumultuous journey where his ship is wrecked in a storm, his lust for the sea remains so strong that he sets out to sea again. This journey, too, ends in disaster as the ship is taken over by [[Sal<U+00E9>]] [[Barbary pirates|pirates]] (the [[Sal<U+00E9> Rovers]]) and Crusoe is enslaved by a [[Moors|Moor]]. Two years later, he escapes in a boat with a boy named Xury; a Captain of a [[Portugal|Portuguese]] ship off the west coast of Africa rescues him. The ship is en route to [[Brazil]]. With the captain's help, Crusoe procures a [[plantation]].

Years later, Crusoe joins an expedition to [[Atlantic slave trade|bring slaves from Africa]] but he is shipwrecked in a storm about forty miles out to sea on an island (which he calls the Island of Despair) near the mouth of the [[Orinoco]] river on September 30, 1659. Only he and three animals, the captain's dog and two cats, survive the shipwreck. Overcoming his despair, he fetches arms, tools, and other supplies from the ship before it breaks apart and sinks. He builds a fenced-in habitat near a cave which he excavates. By making marks in a wooden cross, he creates a calendar. By using tools salvaged from the ship, and ones he makes himself, he hunts, grows barley and rice, dries grapes to make raisins, learns to make pottery, and raises goats. He also adopts a small parrot. He reads the Bible and becomes religious, thanking God for his fate in which nothing is missing but human society.

More years pass and Crusoe discovers native [[Cannibalism|cannibals]], who occasionally visit the island to kill and eat prisoners. At first he plans to kill them for committing an abomination but later realizes he has no right to do so, as the cannibals do not knowingly commit a crime. He dreams of obtaining one or two servants by freeing some prisoners; when a prisoner escapes, Crusoe helps him, naming his new companion [[Man Friday|"Friday"]] after the day of the week he appeared. Crusoe then teaches him English and converts him to Christianity.

After more natives arrive to partake in a cannibal feast, Crusoe and Friday kill most of the natives and save two prisoners. One is Friday's father and the other is a Spaniard, who informs Crusoe about other Spaniards shipwrecked on the mainland. A plan is devised wherein the Spaniard would return to the mainland with Friday's father and bring back the others, build a ship, and sail to a Spanish port.

Before the Spaniards return, an English ship appears; mutineers have commandeered the vessel and intend to maroon their captain on the island. Crusoe and the ship's captain strike a deal in which Crusoe helps the captain and the loyal sailors retake the ship and leave the worst mutineers on the island. Before embarking for England, Crusoe shows the mutineers how he survived on the island and states that there will be more men coming. Crusoe leaves the island 19 December 1686 and arrives in England on 11 June 1687. He learns that his family, believing him dead, left him nothing in his father's will. Crusoe departs for Lisbon to reclaim the profits of his estate in Brazil, which has granted him much wealth. In conclusion, he transports his wealth overland to England to avoid travelling by sea. Friday accompanies him and, en route, they endure one last adventure together as they fight off famished wolves while crossing the [[Pyrenees]].

==Reception and sequels==

The book was published on 25 April 1719. Before the end of the year, this first volume had run through four editions.

By the end of the 19th century, no book in the history of [[Western literature]] had more editions, spin-offs and translations (even into languages such as [[Inuktitut]], [[Coptic language|Coptic]] and [[Maltese language|Maltese]]) than ''Robinson Crusoe'', with more than 700 such alternative versions, including children's versions with mainly pictures and no text.<ref>[[Ian Watt]]. "Robinson Crusoe as a Myth", from ''Essays in Criticism'' (April 1951). Reprinted in the Norton Critical Edition (second edition, 1994) of ''Robinson Crusoe''.</ref>

The term "[[Robinsonade]]" was coined to describe the genre of stories similar to ''Robinson Crusoe''.

Defoe went on to write a lesser-known sequel, ''[[The Farther Adventures of Robinson Crusoe]]''. It was intended to be the last part of his stories, according to the original title-page of its first edition but a third part, ''Serious Reflections During the Life & Surprising Adventures of Robinson Crusoe, With His Vision of the Angelic World'', was added later; it is a mostly forgotten series of moral essays with Crusoe's name attached to give interest.

==Real-life castaways==
{{See also|Castaway#Real occurrences}}
[[Image:Alexander Selkirk Title Page.jpg|right|thumb|Book on [[Alexander Selkirk]]]]
There were many stories of real-life castaways in Defoe's time. Defoe's immediate inspiration for Crusoe is usually thought to be a Scottish sailor named [[Alexander Selkirk]], who was rescued in 1709 by [[Woodes Rogers]]' expedition after four years on the uninhabited island of [[Robinson Crusoe Island|M<U+00E1>s a Tierra]] in the [[Juan Fern<U+00E1>ndez Islands]] off the [[Chile|Chilean coast]]. Rogers' "Cruising Voyage" was published in 1712, with an account of Alexander Selkirk's ordeal. However, ''Robinson Crusoe'' is far from a copy of Woodes Rogers' account: Selkirk was marooned at his own request, while Crusoe was shipwrecked; the islands are different; Selkirk lived alone for the whole time, while Crusoe found companions; while Selkirk stayed on his island for four years, not twenty-eight. Furthermore, much of the appeal of Defoe's novel is the detailed and captivating account of Crusoe's thoughts, occupations and activities which goes far beyond that of Rogers' basic descriptions of Selkirk, which account for only a few pages.

[[Tim Severin]]'s book ''Seeking Robinson Crusoe'' (2002) unravels a much wider and more plausible range of potential sources of inspiration, and concludes by identifying castaway surgeon Henry Pitman as the most likely. An employee of the Duke of Monmouth, Pitman played a part in the [[Monmouth Rebellion]]. His short book about his desperate escape from a Caribbean penal colony, followed by his shipwrecking and subsequent desert island misadventures, was published by J. Taylor of Paternoster Row, London, whose son William Taylor later published Defoe's novel. Severin argues that since Pitman appears to have lived in the lodgings above the father's publishing house and that Defoe himself was a mercer in the area at the time, Defoe may have met Pitman in person and learned of his experiences first-hand, or possibly through submission of a draft.<ref>Severin, Tim - ''In search of Robinson Crusoe'' - New York, Basic Books, 2002 - ISBN 0-465-07698-X</ref>

Severin also discusses another publicised case of a marooned man named only as [[Will (Indian)|Will]], of the [[Miskito people|Miskito]] people of Central America, who may have led to the depiction of [[Man Friday]].<ref>[[William Dampier]], ''A New Voyage round the World'', 1697 [http://www.canadiana.org/ECO/PageView?id=8cdc43bc3b53489c&display=34672+0025].</ref>

==Interpretations==
Despite its simple narrative style, it was received well in the literary world. The book is one of the most widely published books in history. It has been popular since the day it was published.

===Colonial===
[[Image:Robinson Crusoe and Man Friday Offterdinger.jpg|200px|thumb|left|Crusoe standing over [[Man Friday|Friday]] after he frees him from the cannibals.]]

Novelist [[James Joyce]] noted that the true symbol of the [[British Empire|British conquest]] is Robinson Crusoe: "He is the true prototype of the British colonist. <U+2026>" The whole Anglo-Saxon spirit is in Crusoe: the manly independence, the unconscious cruelty, the persistence, the slow yet efficient intelligence, the sexual apathy, the calculating taciturnity."<ref>James Joyce, <U+201C>Daniel Defoe,<U+201D> translated from Italian manuscript and edited by Joseph Prescott, ''Buffalo Studies'' 1 (1964): 24<U+2013>25</ref>

In a sense Crusoe attempts to replicate his society on the island. This is achieved through the use of European technology, agriculture and even a rudimentary political hierarchy. Several times in the novel Crusoe refers to himself as the 'king' of the island, whilst the captain describes him as the 'governor' to the mutineers. At the very end of the novel the island is explicitly referred to as a 'colony'. The idealised master-servant relationship Defoe depicts between Crusoe and Friday can also be seen in terms of [[cultural imperialism]]. Crusoe represents the 'enlightened' European whilst Friday is the 'savage' who can only be redeemed from his barbarous way of life through assimilation into Crusoe's culture. Nonetheless Defoe also takes the opportunity to criticise the historic Spanish conquest of South America.

===Religious===
According to J.P. Hunter, Robinson is not a hero but an [[everyman]]. He begins as a wanderer, aimless on a sea he does not understand and ends as a [[pilgrim]], crossing a final mountain to enter the [[promised land]]. The book tells the story of how Robinson becomes closer to God, not through listening to [[sermon]]s in a church but through spending time alone amongst [[nature]] with only a Bible to read.

''Robinson Crusoe'' is filled with religious aspects. Defoe was a [[Puritan]] moralist and normally worked in the guide tradition, writing books on how to be a good Puritan Christian, such as ''The New Family Instructor'' (1727) and ''Religious Courtship'' (1722). While ''Robinson Crusoe'' is far more than a guide, it shares many of the themes and theological and moral points of view. "Crusoe" may have been taken from Timothy Cruso, a classmate of Defoe's who had written guide books, including ''God the Guide of Youth'' (1695), before dying at an early age <U+2013> just eight years before Defoe wrote ''Robinson Crusoe''. Cruso would have been remembered by contemporaries and the association with guide books is clear. It has even been speculated that ''God the Guide of Youth'' inspired ''Robinson Crusoe'' because of a number of passages in that work that are closely tied to the novel.<ref>Hunter, J. Paul (1966) ''The Reluctant Pilgrim''. As found in Norton Critical Edition (see References).</ref>

The Biblical story of [[Jonah]] is alluded to in the first part of the novel. Like Jonah, Crusoe neglects his 'duty' and is punished at sea.

A leitmotif of the novel is the Christian notion of [[Divine providence|Providence]], penitence and redemption. Crusoe comes to repent of the follies of his youth. He learns to pray to God, first by randomly opening his Bible. He reads the words of Psalm 50 where he reads, "Call upon me in the day of trouble; I will deliver you, and you shall glorify me.<U+201D>
Crusoe often feels guided by a divinely ordained fate, thus explaining his robust optimism in the face of apparent hopelessness. His various fortunate intuitions are taken as evidence of a benign spirit world. Defoe also foregrounds this theme by arranging highly significant events in the novel to occur on Crusoe's birthday. The denouement culminates not only in Crusoe's deliverance from the island, but his spiritual deliverance, his acceptance of Christian doctrine, and in his intuition of his own salvation.

===Moral===
When confronted with the cannibals, Crusoe wrestles with the problem of [[cultural relativism]]. Despite his disgust, he feels unjustified in holding the natives morally responsible for a practice so deeply ingrained in their culture. Nevertheless he retains his belief in an absolute standard of morality; he regards cannibalism as a 'national crime' and forbids Friday from practicing it.

===Economic===
{{Main|Robinson Crusoe economy}}
In [[classical economics|classical]], [[neoclassical economics|neoclassical]] and [[Austrian economics]], Crusoe is regularly used to illustrate the theory of production and choice in the absence of trade, money and prices.<ref name="isbn0-393-95924-4">{{cite book |author=Varian, Hal R. |title=Intermediate microeconomics: a modern approach |publisher=W.W. Norton |location=New York |year=1990 |isbn=0-393-95924-4 |oclc= |accessdate=}}</ref> Crusoe must allocate effort between production and leisure and must choose between alternative production possibilities to meet his needs. The arrival of Friday is then used to illustrate the possibility of and gains from trade.

The classical treatment of the Crusoe economy has been discussed and criticised from a variety of perspectives.

[[Karl Marx]] analysed Crusoe in his classic work ''[[Das Kapital]]'', mocking the heavy use in classical economics of the fictional story. In Marxist terms, Crusoe's experiences on the island represents the inherent economic value of labour over capital. Crusoe frequently observes that the money he salvaged from the ship is worthless on the island, especially when compared to his tools.

For the literary critic [[Angus Ross]], Defoe's point is that money has no intrinsic value and is only valuable insofar as it can be used in trade. There is also a notable correlation between Crusoe's spiritual and financial development, possibly signifying Defoe's belief in the [[Protestant work ethic]].

The Crusoe model has also been assessed from the perspectives of feminism.<ref name="urlRobinson Crusoe: The quintessential economic man? - Feminist Economics">{{cite web |url=http://www.informaworld.com/smpp/880176995-23780287/content~content=a714042213~db=all~order=page |title=Robinson Crusoe: The quintessential economic man? <U+2013> Feminist Economics |work=}}</ref>

==Legacy==
{{Refimprove section|date=September 2010}}
The book proved so popular that the names of the two main protagonists have entered the language. During [[World War II]], people who decided to stay and hide in the [[Planned destruction of Warsaw|ruins of the German-occupied city]] of [[Warsaw]] for a period of three winter months, from October to January 1945, when they were rescued by the [[Red Army]], were later called  [[Robinson Crusoes of Warsaw]].<ref>Engelking, Barbara; Libionka, Dariusz (2009).

===Literature===
Robinson Crusoe marked the beginning of realistic fiction as a literary genre

Its success led to many imitators and castaway novels became quite popular in Europe in the 18th and early 19th centuries. Most of these have fallen into obscurity but some became established including ''[[The Swiss Family Robinson]]''.

[[Jonathan Swift]]'s ''[[Gulliver's Travels]]'', published seven years after ''Robinson Crusoe'', may be read as a systematic rebuttal of Defoe's optimistic account of human capability. In ''The Unthinkable Swift: The Spontaneous Philosophy of a Church of England Man'' [[Warren Montag]] argues that Swift was concerned to refute the notion that the individual precedes society, as Defoe's novel seems to suggest. Swift regarded such thought as a dangerous endorsement of [[Thomas Hobbes]]' radical political philosophy and for this reason Gulliver repeatedly encounters established societies rather than desolate islands. The captain who invites Gulliver to serve as a surgeon aboard his ship on the disastrous third voyage is named Robinson.

In [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]]'s treatise on education, ''[[Emile: Or, On Education]]'', the one book Emile the protagonist is allowed to read before the age of twelve is ''Robinson Crusoe''. Rousseau wants Emile to identify himself as Crusoe so he could rely upon himself for all of his needs. In Rousseau's view, Emile needs to imitate Crusoe's experience, allowing necessity to determine what is to be learned and accomplished. This is one of the main themes of Rousseau's educational model.
[[Image:Robinson crusoe bookstore.JPG|thumb|Robinson Crusoe Bookstore on [[<U+0130>stiklal Avenue]], [[Istanbul]].]]

In ''[[The Tale of Little Pig Robinson]]'', [[Beatrix Potter]] directs the reader to ''Robinson Crusoe'' for a detailed description of the island (the land of the Bong tree) to which her eponymous hero moves. She describes the land of the Bong tree as being similar to Robinson Crusoe's, "only without its drawbacks."

In [[Wilkie Collins]]'s most popular novel, ''[[The Moonstone]]'', one of the chief characters and narrators, Gabriel Betteredge has faith in all that Robinson Crusoe says and uses the book for a sort of divination. He considers ''The Adventures of Robinson Crusoe'' the finest book ever written and considers a man but poorly read if he had happened not to read the book.

In Kenneth Gardner's award winning 2002 novel ''Rich Man's Coffin'', he portrays the true story of a black American slave who escapes on a whaling ship to New Zealand to become chief of one of the cannibal Maori tribes. This is a reversal of racial roles, with the black man taking the lead role of the Robinson Crusoe figure.

French novelist [[Michel Tournier]] wrote ''Friday'' (French ''[[:fr:Vendredi ou les Limbes du Pacifique|Vendredi ou les Limbes du Pacifique]]'') published in 1967. His novel explores themes including civilisation versus nature, the psychology of solitude as well as death and sexuality in a retelling of Defoe's ''Robinson Crusoe'' story. Tournier's Robinson chooses to remain on the island, rejecting civilisation when offered the chance to escape 28 years after being shipwrecked.

Likewise, in 1963, [[JMG Le Clezio]], winner of the 2008 [[Nobel Prize]] in literature, published the novel [[Le Proces-Verbal]].  The book's epigraph is a quote from Robinson Crusoe, and like Crusoe, Adam Pollo suffers long periods of loneliness.

"Crusoe in England," a 183-line poem by [[Elizabeth Bishop]], imagines Crusoe near the end of his life, recalling his time of exile with a mixture of bemusement and regret. No longer a cultural supremacist, Crusoe remembers Friday, who has since died, with deep nostalgia and affection.

[[J. M. Coetzee]]'s 1986 novel ''[[Foe (novel)|Foe]]'' recounts the tale of Robinson Crusoe from the aspect of Susan Barton who went on to star in another of DeFoe's novels. In this novel Crusoe is depicted as a much less motivated man and Friday as a mute.

American novelist [[Thomas Berger (novelist)|Thomas Berger]] created a modern version of the story in his 1994 novel ''Robert Crews'', in which the protagonist is a middle-aged alcoholic who survives a plane crash at a rural lake, and eventually encounters his "Friday," a young woman fleeing an abusive marriage.

===Stage and film===

[[Jacques Offenbach]] wrote an [[op<U+00E9>ra comique]] called ''[[Robinson Cruso<U+00E9>]]'' which was first performed at the [[Op<U+00E9>ra-Comique]], Salle Favart on 23 November 1867. This was based on the British pantomime version rather than the novel itself. The libretto was by Eug<U+00E8>ne Cormon and [[Hector-Jonathan Cr<U+00E9>mieux]]. The opera includes a [[duet]] by Robinson Crusoe and Friday.

There is a 1927 silent film titled ''[[Robinson Crusoe (1927 film)|Robinson Crusoe]]''. The Soviet 3D film [[Robinzon Kruzo]] was produced in 1946. [[Luis Bu<U+00F1>uel]] directed ''[[Adventures of Robinson Crusoe]]'' starring [[Dan O'Herlihy]], released in 1954. [[Peter O'Toole]] and [[Richard Roundtree]] co-starred in a 1975 film ''[[Man Friday (film)|Man Friday]]'' which satirically portrayed Crusoe as incapable of seeing his dark-skinned companion as anything but an inferior creature, while Friday is more enlightened and empathetic. In 1988, [[Aidan Quinn]] portrayed Robinson Crusoe in the film ''[[Crusoe (film)|Crusoe]]''. A 1997 movie entitled ''[[Robinson Crusoe (1997 film)|Robinson Crusoe]]'' starred [[Pierce Brosnan]] and received limited commercial success. [[Walt Disney]] later modernized the novel with ''[[Lt. Robin Crusoe, U.S.N.]]'', featuring [[Dick Van Dyke]].

Variations on the theme include the 1954 ''[[Miss Robin Crusoe]]'', with a female castaway, played by [[Amanda Blake]], and a female Friday, and the 1964 film ''[[Robinson Crusoe on Mars]]'', starring [[Paul Mantee]], with an alien Friday portrayed by [[Victor Lundin]]. The 2000 film ''[[Cast Away]]'', with [[Tom Hanks]] as a FedEx employee stranded on an Island for many years, also borrows much from the Robinson Crusoe story.

===Television===
In 1964 a French film production crew made a 13 part serial of "[[The Adventures of Robinson Crusoe (TV series)|The Adventures of Robinson Crusoe]]". It starred [[Robert Hoffmann|Robert Hoffman]]. The black and white series was dubbed into English and German. In the UK, the BBC aired it on numerous occasions between 1965 and 1977.

In 1981 [[Czechoslovakia]]n director and animator [[Stanislav L<U+00E1>tal]] made a version of the story under the name [[Adventures of Robinson Crusoe, a Sailor from York|''Dobrodru<U+017E>stv<U+00ED> Robinsona Crusoe, n<U+00E1>mo<U+0159>n<U+00ED>ka z Yorku'']] (The Adventures of Robinson Crusoe, a sailor from York) combining traditional and stop-motion animation. The movie was coproduced by regional West Germany broadcaster Sudwestfunk Baden-Baden.

In the mid-1990s there was a humorous French cartoon called ''[[Robinson Sucroe]]''. In the cartoon, Robinson was a failed journalist for the ''[[New York Herald]]''. Seeking a life of adventure, he desired to settle on an island and wished to write his weekly journal. After getting an okay from his boss, he sets sail and he is left on an uninhabited island (or so he thought). Robinson discovers that the island is inhabited by French and British pirates as well as the survivor of a shipwreck, who called themselves "Toul<U+00E9>jours" (the Everydays). Robinson befriend a fellow named Mercredi (Wednesday). Robinson tries to write a colourful journal but he is incapable of doing so, instead Mercredi writes fictitious stories for him. These stories achieve much success and few suspect their authenticity.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.krinein.com/medias/robinson-sucroe-oc3561.html |title=Robinson Sucro<U+00EB> |date= |language=French |publisher=Krinein, le magazine critique de la pop culture |accessdate=16 June 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.krinein.com/medias/robinson-sucroe-3572.html |title=Robinson Sucro<U+00EB> <U+2013> T'es en sucre ? |author=weirdkorn |date=4 January 2006 |publisher=Krinein, le magazine critique de la pop culture |accessdate=16 June 2010}}</ref>

The 2003 French TV movie starred [[Pierre Richard]] as Robinson.

In 2008, a television series titled [[Crusoe (TV series)|Crusoe]] aired for 12 episodes. It was based loosely on the novel and was not renewed for a second season.
