'''Kieron Brady''' (born [[17 September]] [[1971]] in [[Glasgow]]) is a former [[professional]] [[football (soccer)|footballer]] who played for [[Sunderland A.F.C.|Sunderland]]. Though born in [[Glasgow]], [[Scotland]], Brady represented the [[Republic of Ireland national football team|Republic of Ireland]] at international level, winning three under-21 caps. An extremely rare vascular condition after complaints of leg pains ultimately forced Brady to retire from the game in 1993, at age 22. It is suggested that perhaps in the future an appropriate "Bolam-type" test should be adopted to assess whether there has been negligence.In recent times he worked for the anti-racism campaign Show Racism the Red Card and has been recognised as a leading anti-racism campaigner and educationalist.
