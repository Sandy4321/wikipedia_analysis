== Background ==
[[Image:Chaliapin and Rachmaninoff crop.jpg|thumb|[[Sergei Rachmaninoff]], c. 1890]]
By the fall of 1896, Rachmaninoff's financial status was precarious, not helped by his being robbed of money on an earlier train trip.<ref name="mw" /> Pressed for time, both financially and by those expecting a symphony, he "rushed into production".<ref name="life">{{cite book |last=Bertensson |first=Sergei |authorlink= |coauthors=Jay Leyda, Sophia Satina |title=Sergei Rachmaninoff: A Lifetime in Music |year=2001 |publisher=Indiana University Press |location=Indiana |isbn=0253214211 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=KM-dgfOaIIkC }}</ref> On December 7, he wrote to Aleksandr Viktorovich Zatayevich (1869&ndash;1936),<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.authorandbookinfo.com/ngcoba/za.htm |title=New General Catalog of Old Books and Authors |accessdate=2007-09-11 |date=2007 |work=New General Catalog of Old Books and Authors }}</ref> a Russian composer he had met before he had composed the work, saying, "I hurry in order to get money I need by a certain date ... This perpetual financial pressure is, on the one hand, quite beneficial ... by the 20th of this month I have to write six piano pieces."<ref name="life" /> Rachmaninoff completed all six during  October and December 1896, and dedicated all to Zatayevich. Despite the hasty circumstances, the work evidences his early [[Virtuoso|virtuosity]], and sets an example for the quality of his future works.<ref name="z" />

''Six Moments Musicaux'' is a sophisticated work that is of longer duration, thicker textures, and greater virtuosic demands on the performer than any of Rachmaninoff's previous solo piano works. It is similar to [[Alexander Scriabin]]'s momentous [[Etude Op. 8 No. 12 (Scriabin)|<U+00C9>tude in D-sharp minor]] (Op. 8, No. 12)&mdash;in both compositions detail is more functional than ornamentative in their musical argument.<ref name="z" /> It is here, rather than in ''[[Morceaux de Fantaisie]]'' (Op. 3, 1892) or ''[[Morceaux de Salon]]'' (Op. 10, 1894), that Rachmaninoff places specific qualities of his own playing into his music.<ref name="z" /> There is passionate lyricism in numbers three and five, but the others require a pianist with virtuoso technique and musical perception.<ref name="z" /> These were composed during the middle of Rachmaninov's career,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.naxos.com/catalogue/item.asp?item_code=8.550349 |title=Piano Sonata no. 2; Variations on a Theme of Corelli; Moments Musicaux: Rachmaninov |accessdate=2007-08-20 |author=Anderson, Keith |date=2000 |work=[[<U+0130>dil Biret]] performing for [[Naxos Records]] }}Liner notes.</ref> and created a foundation of inner voices that he would elaborate on in his ''[[Preludes, Op. 23 (Rachmaninoff)|Preludes]]'' (Op. 23) and ''[[<U+00C9>tudes-Tableaux, Op. 33 (Rachmaninoff)|<U+00C9>tudes-Tableaux]]'' (Op. 33).<ref name="z" />  Although he usually gave the premi<U+00E8>re of his own piano works, he was not the first to perform these, and to date the first public performance has not been determined.<ref name="z" />

The set is inspired by [[Franz Schubert]]'s piano [[song cycle|cycle]], also called ''[[Six Moments Musicaux (Schubert)|Six Moments Musicaux]]'' (Op. 94, 1828).<ref>

== Composition ==
=== Andantino in B-flat minor ===
[[Image:Moments Musicaux 1.png|thumb|300px|In ''Andantino'', the ''Con moto'' shows off the long melody in a [[Compound meter (music)|compound meter]] (7/4).<ref name="a" /> {{Audio|MM1 excerpt.ogg|Listen}} ]]
The first piece has an ''[[wiktionary:Andantino|Andantino]]'' (Moderate) [[Tempo#Italian tempo markings|tempo]], is 113&nbsp;[[Bar (music)|measure]]s long, and is marked at 72&nbsp;[[quarter note]]s&nbsp;[[Beats per minute|per minute]].<ref name="book">{{cite book |last=Rachmaninoff |first=Serge |title=Sonata No. 1 and Other Works for Solo Piano |year=2001 |publisher=[[Dover Publications]] |location=Mineola, New York|New York|isbn=0-486-41885-5 }}Text at [http://books.google.com/books?id=9XPdMVomM3cC&dq=sonata+no+1+and+other+works+for+solo+piano&printsec=frontcover&source=web&ots=abzUMOEUnC&sig=yvqnGfc1IFrREAWyxbaE0GuiMkg#PPP1,M1 Google Books].</ref> It is divided into three distinct sections. The first presents a [[Theme (music)|theme]] in common time ([[Time signature#Most frequent time signatures|4/4]]) with a typical [[nocturne]] figure for the left hand.<ref name="book" /> A mid-piece pause at roughly the same area in Schubert's first ''Moments Musicaux'' further emphasizes the influence of Schubert.<ref name="hancock" /> The second part is marked ''[[wiktionary:Con moto|Con moto]]'' (With motion), at 76&nbsp;quarter&nbsp;notes&nbsp;per&nbsp;minute, and is a variation of the first theme in the unusual configuration of seven quarter notes per measure ([[Time signature#Complex time signatures|7/4]]). This part ends in a [[cadenza]]. The third section presents the last variation of the theme, again in common time, but in the fastest tempo yet, ''Andantino con moto'', at 84&nbsp;quarter&nbsp;notes&nbsp;per&nbsp;minute. The piece ends in a [[Coda (music)|coda]] that returns to the first tempo, and repeats portions of the previous three parts. It ends with a [[Cadence (music)#Classification of cadences in common practice tonality|perfect authentic cadence]] into B-flat minor.<ref name="book" />

''Andantino'' is the longest in the set by playing time (about 8:30).<ref name="a" /> It is described as a "generic-hybrid", combining elements of the [[nocturne]] and [[Variation (music)|theme and variation]] genres.<ref name="hancock" /> The melody is [[Diatonic and chromatic|chromatic]], [[Syncopation|syncopated]], and long, all idiosyncratic elements Rachmaninoff often includes in his works.<ref name="a" /> Because of this, the ''Andantino'' is sometimes called an extension of his ''Nocturne in A minor'' of the ''Morceaux de Salon'' set (Op. 10, No. 1, 1894).<ref name="mw" /> However, ''Andantino'' stands on its own with difficulties, such as the sections with multiple [[Phrase (music)|phrases]] in a single hand.<ref name="book" />

=== Allegretto in E-flat minor ===
[[Image:Moments Musicaux 2.png|thumb|300px|In ''Allegretto'''s section two, the [[Dynamics (music)|dynamics]] change so frequently they become one of the major hurdles in this piece.<ref name="book" />]]
The second piece, referred to as a "glittering showpiece", is positioned in stark contrast to the lyrical and "atmospheric" melody of the first piece.<ref name="d" /> The piece is in the quick [[tempo]] ''[[wiktionary:Allegretto|Allegretto]]'' (quickly), at 92&nbsp;quarter&nbsp;notes&nbsp;per&nbsp;minute. It is 131&nbsp;measures long, the most of all six ''Moments Musicaux'',<ref name="book" /> but the second shortest in terms of playing time, usually no longer than three and a half minutes (the shortest is number four).<ref name="a" /> This piece represents a typical [[Romantic music|nineteenth-century]] [[<U+00E9>tude]], similar in style to [[Fr<U+00E9>d<U+00E9>ric Chopin]]'s [[<U+00C9>tudes (Chopin)|<U+00C9>tudes]] (Opp. 10, 12), with a melody interspersed between rapid [[Tuplet|sextuplet]] figures.<ref name="a" /> It is in strict [[ternary form]] with a coda: identical beginning and ending sections beginning on measures 1 and 85, and a contrasting middle section starting on measure 45. The second section radically changes [[dynamics (music)|dynamics]], constantly changing from ''[[wiktionary:piano#Adjective|piano]]'' to ''[[wiktionary:fortissimo|fortissimo]]'' and even ''[[wiktionary:sforzando|sforzando]]''.<ref name="book" /> It is, throughout, a relentless torrent of descending [[Semitone|half steps]] and a cascading left hand figure reminiscent of Chopin's ''[[<U+00C9>tude Op. 10, No. 12 (Chopin)|Revolutionary <U+00C9>tude]]'' (Op. 10, No. 12, 1831).<ref name="a" /> Ending the piece is a slow coda in ''[[wiktionary:adagio#Adverb|Adagio]]'' (at ease) which closes with a [[Cadence (music)|perfect authentic cadence]] in E-flat major.<ref name="book" />

Rachmaninoff revised this piece in March of 1940, changing the melody but leaving the constant sextuplets, proving that the rushing figures are not simple bravura or flair.<ref name="z" />

=== Andante Cantabile in B minor ===
[[Image:Moments Musicaux 3.png|thumb|300px|The entire ''Andante Cantabile'' has low, dark, and thick melodies reminiscent of a [[funeral march]].<ref name="hancock" />]]
Again, the next piece drastically differs from the previous: the continual gauntlets of number two is relieved by the third piece in the set, an "introspective r<U+00EA>verie" French for "daydream").<ref name="mw" /> Drawing on the previous illustration of a "generic hybrid", this piece is described as a mixture between the [[song]] without words and [[funeral march]] genres,<ref name="hancock" /> to create what is called "the most Russian" piece of the set,<ref name="a" /> containing both sonorous bass and a solid melody, characteristics of [[Ethnic Russian music|Russian music]].<ref name="z" /> 

Comprising only 55&nbsp;measures, this piece is one of the shortest but has one of the longer playing times of about seven minutes.<ref name="a" /> The piece is structured as a three-part form. The theme of the first section is played entirely in [[minor third]]s, accompanied by a left hand figure of [[Perfect fifth|open fifths]] and [[octave]]s. The middle section has the melody in [[minor sixth]]s, alongside a [[staccato]] octave bass. The lament of the opening theme transforms into an explicit funeral march as the left-hand octaves become regular.<ref name="z" />

=== Presto in E minor ===
[[Image:Revolutionary <U+00E9>tude and moment musicaux 4.png|thumb|300px|[[<U+00C9>tude Op. 10, No. 12 (Chopin)|''Revolutionary <U+00E9>tude'']] ([[Fr<U+00E9>d<U+00E9>ric Chopin|Chopin]], top) bears comparison to ''Presto'' in the continual left-hand figures and minimal melody.]]
The fourth piece is similar to the second in the quality of its performance. The fourth piece reveals resemblance to Chopin's ''Revolutionary <U+00E9>tude'' in the taxing left hand figure place throughout. Further it looks, sounds, and feels as if it were an improvisation on Chopin's [[Preludes (Chopin)|Prelude in G major]] (Op. 28, No. 3).<ref name="z" /> The piece is 67&nbsp;measures long, with a duration of about three minutes, and has the fastest tempo of the set, ''[[wiktionary:Presto|Presto]]'' (quick) at 104&nbsp;quarter&nbsp;notes&nbsp;per&nbsp;minute, and is the shortest work in terms of playing time.<ref name="a" /> 

[[Image:Moments Musicaux 4.png|thumb|300px|Left hand figure in opening ''Presto'' (top) and third section's ''Pi<U+00F9> vivo''. The "registral displacement" (highlighted) alters certain notes in the familiar figure to increase tension.<ref name="hancock" /> {{Audio|MM4 excerpt.ogg|Listen}} ]]
''Presto'' is in ternary form with a coda. The piece begins with a ''fortissimo'' introduction with a thick texture in the left hand consisting of chromatic sextuplets. The melody is a "rising quasi-military" idea, interspersed between replications of the left hand figure,<ref name="mw" /> the mostly two-note melody being a strong unifying element.<ref name="z" /> The middle section is a brief period of ''pianississimo'' falling figures in the right hand and rising scales in the left. The third section is marked ''[[wiktionary:Pi<U+00F9>|Pi<U+00F9>]] [[wiktionary:vivo|vivo]]'' (More life) and is played even faster than the intro, 112&nbsp;quarter&nbsp;notes&nbsp;per&nbsp;minute.<ref name="book" /> At this point the piece develops a very thick texture, with the original left hand figure played in both hands in varying [[Register (music)|registers]]. The technique of rapidly change the octave in which a melody is played, sometimes called "registral displacement", is used to present the figure in a more dramatic form that increases the intensity of the ending.<ref name="hancock" /> The ending, a coda in ''[[wiktionary:Prestissimo|Prestissimo]]'' (very quick), 116&nbsp;quarter&nbsp;notes&nbsp;per&nbsp;minute, is a final, sweeping reiteration of the theme that closes in a heavy [[E minor]] chord,<ref name="book" /> which revisits Rachmaninoff's preoccupation with bell sounds, prominent in his [[Piano Concerto No. 2 (Rachmaninoff)|Piano Concerto No. 2]] and [[Prelude in C-sharp minor]] (Op. 3, No. 2).<ref name="z" />

The piece is a major exercise in endurance and accuracy: the introduction opens in a left hand figure requiring span of a [[Interval (music)|tenth interval]]. Additionally, octave intervals invariably appear before fast sextuplet runs, making quick wrists and arm action necessary. The double melodies Rachmaninoff uses in this work exists purposely to "keep both hands occupied", obscuring the melody and making it difficult for the right hand to project.<ref name="a" /> This is the only piece in the set with indicated [[Sustain pedal|pedal]] markings.<ref name="book" />

=== Adagio sostenuto in D-flat major ===
[[Image:Moments Musicaux 5.png|thumb|300px|The left hand plays almost identical figures throughout ''Adagio sostenuto''.<ref name="book" />]]
Following the torrential gauntlets of number four is the fifth piece, likened in a [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D]] [[thesis]] to a passage in the [[Bible]] ([[Books of Kings|1 Kings]] 19:12, read {{niv|1Kings|19:12|text}}), which says, "And after the fire came a gentle whisper." This is in direct reference to the position of the work between two pieces with "incredible pyrotechnics," as the figurative calm before and after the storm.<ref name="hancock" /> The piece is similar to the form of a [[barcarolle]], a folk song with a rhythmic [[tuplet]] accompaniment. Playing it takes approximately five minutes, and it is 53&nbsp;measures long, the shortest in terms of measures.<ref name="a" /> It is an ''Adagio [[sostenuto]]'' (sustained At ease) at 54&nbsp;quarter&nbsp;notes&nbsp;per&nbsp;minute, with a simple melody presented in ternary form.<ref name="book" />

Lacking any prodigious figures or difficult runs, the piece displays Rachmaninoff's capability for musical lyricism. Although the piece seems simple, the mood must be sustained by playing simultaneously restrained but dynamic triplet figures in the left hand. The melody, a chordal texture with frequent [[Neighboring tone#Suspension|suspended tones]], creates a difficult task in [[Voicing (music)|voicing]], and placing the correct emphasis on the correct notes. Its relatively short melody lines are a direct contrast to Rachmaninoff's characteristically long lines, giving a shorter time to bring out the [[Phrase (music)|phrases]].<ref name="a" />

=== Maestoso in C major ===
[[Image:Moment Musicaux 6.png|thumb|300px|''Maestoso'' is full of this thick texture, complicating the "challenging chordal melody".<ref name="a" />]]
The last piece in the set, number six, is a quintessential nineteenth-century work, and has been described as an "[[wiktionary:apotheosis|apotheosis]] or completion of struggle." The piece was once summarized as:
{{Quote|The final piece or movement of a cycle that is virtuosic and brilliant, employing the entire range of dynamics and sonorities available to the piano, bringing a set of pieces to a glorious conclusion.|Robin Hancock|Boston University, 1992<ref name="hancock" />}}
This "stormy, agitated" work contains a "vehemently [[Dotted note#Triple dotting|triple-dotted]] main theme and only some brief mid-section hazy sunshine <nowiki>[that lightens]</nowiki> the storm before ''[[wiktionary:fortississimo|fortississimo]]'' thunders return and finally dominate."<ref name="d" /> Despite the dark imagery presented to describe the piece, the work is in [[C major]], and the end result is more light-hearted than dark,<ref name="a" /> but not as triumphal as the ''[[Maestoso]]'' would make it sound.<ref name="waller" />

Like the second and fourth pieces, number six is written in the form of an <U+00E9>tude, with a repetitive but technically challenging chordal melody that is doubled in both hands.<ref name="a" />  In all, the work has three distinct elements played simultaneously: the main melody, the continuous [[thirty-second note]] [[List of musical terminology#B|broken chord]] figures, and a descending [[eighth note]] [[Motif (music)|motif]].<ref name="book" /> Dynamics play a large part in this piece: the ''fortissimo'' marked at the beginning is maintained all throughout the first section, with only brief respites to ''[[wiktionary:mezzo forte|mezzo forte]]''.<ref name="book" /> The middle section is wholly softer, and contains two areas with significant mounting tension, creating the aforementioned "apotheosis effect" with dramatic "false starts."<ref name="hancock" /> Here, Rachmaninoff manipulates the theme [[Counterpoint|contrapuntally]] to develop a [[Canon (music)|canonic]] effect. This "triple counterpoint. . . is titanic both in size and impact, and in potential for disaster,"<ref name="hancock" /> referring to the tension, waiting for the final climax, in this "continuing explosion."<ref name="z" /> Immediately before the coda, the thick texture and canon suddenly disappear and the piece becomes ''piano''. Upon entering the coda, the work resumes the ''forte'' theme and amalgamates to a majestic ending played ''fortississimo''.<ref name="book" />

''Maestoso'' is one of the most difficult pieces in the set. Stamina and strength are required to sustain a full resonant sound, while the continuous thirty-second figure can be tiring for the pianist.<ref name="a" /> Consistent tempo is a problem for this piece, due to the melody being interspersed with two other elements. Additionally, the dynamics, mostly "loud" and "very loud", indicate that an accurate vision of relative volume is necessary.<ref name="a" /> Maintaining this accuracy while managing every other element of the piece and successfully presenting a musically solid performance continues to be the ultimate challenge of all.<ref name="hancock" />

== Reception ==
The six ''Moments Musicaux'' was well received by critics. During the writing of his first symphony, Rachmaninoff was distracted from solo piano work, and the ''Moments'' were regarded as his return to mature composition.<ref name="il">{{cite book |last=Matthew-Walker |first=Robert |title=The Illustrated Lives of the Great Composers: Rachmaninoff |year=1984 |publisher=Omnibus Press |location=London |isbn=978-0711902534 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=pQulqk8Ts70C }}</ref> Although revolutionary and grand in style,<ref name="il" /> they retain the charm of his early works, as mentioned by pianist Elizabeth Wolff: "They are typical of his early works, dense, rich in counterpoint, highly chromatic, poignantly nationalistic, deeply felt, and of course, exceptionally challenging to the pianist."<ref name="w"/> Later performances of this work would reveal that Rachmaninoff had hidden a subtle rhythm and vitality that emerged under the long, [[Melody|melodic]] [[Phrase (music)|phrases]], furthering his acclaim as an incredibly complex musician.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.inkpot.com/concert/nafa99berman2.html |title=Lazar Berman Celebrity Concert review|accessdate=2007-09-10 |author=Soo, Kian Hing  |date=[[1999-05-14]] |work=The Flying Inkpot classical concert reviews }}</ref> The ''Moments'' go as far as to "confirm the inexplicable inherent in genius", with "exquisite melody, wondrous harmonic changes, 'heavenly brevity'," while maintaining "a sense of contrast and variety that allows each miniature to stand alone while complementing the work on either side of it."<ref name="w" /> Although it is unknown whether the financial reaction of this composition recouped his stolen money, the emotional reaction to ''Moments Musicaux'' would be overshadowed for the following years by the catastrophic [[premiere]] in 1897 of his two-years' labor: [[Symphony No. 1 (Rachmaninoff)|Symphony No. 1]] (Op. 13, 1895).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.kennedy-center.org/calendar/index.cfm?fuseaction=composition&composition_id=2069 |title=About the Composition: Symphony No. 1 in D minor, Op. 13 |accessdate=2007-09-10 |author=Freed, Richard |date=[[2002-11-23]] |work=[[John F.
