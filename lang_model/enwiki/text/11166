'''[[The Beatles]]''' released twelve original [[album]]s, twelve [[Extended play|EP]]s (mainly consisting of material also available on their albums), one [[double EP]], and twenty-four [[single (music)|singles]] (mainly featuring original music not found on their albums) in eight years (1962-1970) in their native [[United Kingdom]]. Their international discography is complicated, however, due to sometimes different versions of their albums released in other countries, particularly in their early years on [[Capitol Records]] in the [[United States]]. In addition, most of their releases are available in both [[monaural|mono]] and [[stereophonic sound|stereo]] mixes.

==Historical background==
The Beatles discography was originally released on the [[Gramophone record|vinyl]] format, with full-length [[LP album|long plays]] (LPs), shorter [[extended play]]s (EPs), and [[Single (music)|single]]s. Over the years, the collection has also been released on [[Compact Cassette|cassette]], [[Stereo 8|8-track]], and [[Compact Disc|compact disc]] (CD). The Beatles catalogue has not yet been released [[Digital audio|digitally]], but steps are being made toward that goal.<ref>http://billboard.biz/bbbiz/content_display/industry/e3ia8abfc4edd03266a1b3a10ca750bdfb7?imw=Y</ref>

Most of the Beatles' albums were released in both [[Monaural|mono]] and [[Stereophonic sound|stereo]]. The first two albums, ''[[Please Please Me]]'' and ''[[With the Beatles]],'' were mixed in mono only. Since mono record players were the most common at the time, producer [[George Martin]] and the Beatles gave more time and attention to preparing mono mixes of their recordings for most of their albums. By the late 1960s, stereo record players were more common; The Beatles' final two albums, ''[[Abbey Road (album)|Abbey Road]]'' and ''[[Let It Be (album)|Let It Be]]'', were originally mixed and released in stereo only. 

The Beatles UK discography was released on CD in the late 1980s. For these, the first four albums were released in mono, and the remaining albums in stereo. However, the sound of the digital transfers of the current discs, produced by George Martin in 1987 and 1988 using the best equipment available during the early days of the format, no longer meet standards achievable using current techniques. Digital remasters of the Beatles' catalogue are currently in development.<ref>http://abbeyrd.best.vwh.net/news/reissuerumors08.html</ref>

The complete, original, Beatles collection (as released in the UK from 1962-1970) can be acquired on CD with the purchase of the 12 studio albums, plus ''[[Magical Mystery Tour (album)|Magical Mystery Tour]]'' and the ''[[Past Masters, Volume One]]'' and ''[[Past Masters, Volume Two|Two]]'' collections, which contain all of their non-album singles and B-sides.

==Official canon (UK discography)==
This section lists the canon of material currently sanctioned by the Beatles as part of their official catalogue.<ref name="thebeatles.com Albums">{{cite web | publisher = thebeatles.com | date =  | author= | title = The Beatles Albums | url=http://thebeatles.com/core/music/ | accessdate = 2008-03-27 }}</ref> After the band's breakup,  [[EMI]], who controlled the Beatles material, "explored a range of repackaging schemes to exploit their Beatles catalogue",<ref name="Rough Guide p. 66">{{cite book  | last = Ingham  | first = Chris  | title = The Rough Guide to the Beatles  | publisher = Rough Guides  | year = 2006  | pages = 66  | isbn = 1843537206}}</ref> without input from the Beatles themselves. It was not until "an agreement reached with EMI/[[Capitol Records|Capitol]] in 1989... gave the Beatles control of future use of all their EMI recordings. This meant that any shoddy repackaging ideas... could now be nipped in the bud by [[Apple Corps|Apple]]".<ref name="Rough Guide p. 71">{{cite book  | last = Ingham  | first = Chris  | title = The Rough Guide to the Beatles  | publisher = Rough Guides  | year = 2006  | pages = 71  | isbn = 1843537206}}</ref> The canon of official Beatles releases include the following albums, EPs, and singles.

===Studio albums===
The official canon of Beatles studio albums consists of the original albums as released in their native UK from 1962 to 1970. The single exception is ''[[Magical Mystery Tour]]'', which was released as a 6-song [[double EP]] in the UK, but as a longer 11-song LP in the U.S. (the LP included singles and B-sides released during that year). When the Beatles catalogue was released on CD in the 1980s, the longer U.S. version was chosen for release and is now considered a part of their official catalogue.

===Singles===
The [[UK Singles Chart]] is compiled solely from sales figures; airplay statistics are not used. For this reason the chart positions for the UK Singles are indicated per disc, not per song. '''Pos''' column indicates the peak position in the charts. Currently, all of the non-album singles can be collected on the ''Past Masters, Volumes [[Past Masters, Volume One|One]] and [[Past Masters, Volume Two|Two]]'' discs (1988), the "[[Baby It's You (The Beatles song)|Baby It's You]]" CD E.P. (1995), the "[[Free as a Bird (song)|Free as a Bird]]" CD Single (1995), and the "[[Real Love (The Beatles song)|Real Love]]" CD single (1996).

==U.S. discography==
===U.S. albums===
The first seven Beatles albums appeared in different versions in the U.S., where [[Capitol Records]] mixed UK album tracks with UK single tracks to create different albums altogether, with different titles, track listings, and often different audio mixes. The first eight of these records have been released on CD as ''[[The Capitol Albums, Volume 1]]'' (2004) and ''[[The Capitol Albums, Volume 2]]'' (2006). The Capitol release of ''[[Rubber Soul]]'' is preferred by some over its UK counterpart, due to its more folky flavour{{Fact|date=June 2007}}; it was this version of the album that greatly influenced the Beach Boys' Brian Wilson, who "answered" it by releasing ''[[Pet Sounds]]'' in 1966{{Fact|date=June 2007}}. Upon the release of ''[[Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band]]'' in 1967, the Beatles albums had the same track listing in both the U.S. and the U.K.  (The only exception to this is ''[[Magical Mystery Tour]]'', which was released as a [[double EP]] in the UK, and a longer [[LP album|LP]] in the U.S., and ''[[Hey Jude (album)|Hey Jude]]'', which was comprised primarily of non-album songs.)

==Canadian discography==

The division of [[Capitol Records]] in [[Canada]] released three unique albums and nine singles in 1963 and 1964 before aligning with the American division and releasing the same albums as in the U.S. The first Canadian release was the "[[Love Me Do]]" single (72076) on 1963-02-04.

After this album, Capitol of Canada synchronised its catalogue production with the U.S. market, beginning with United Artists' ''[[A Hard Day's Night (album)|A Hard Day's Night]]'' and concluding with Apple's ''[[Hey Jude (album)|Hey Jude]]''. Notably, the albums ''[[Something New (album)|Something New]]'' and ''[[The Beatles' Story]]'' were only produced in mono when originally released. In 1967 the American back catalogue was released in Canada:
* ''[[The Beatles' Second Album]]'', ST 2080 (Stereo)/ T 2080 (Mono), 1 February 1967
* ''[[Meet The Beatles]]'', ST 2047 (Stereo), 1 February 1967
* ''[[Something New (album)|Something New]]'', ST 2108, 1 February 1967
* ''[[The Beatles' Story]]'', STBO 2222 (Stereo), 1 August 1968
* ''[[The Early Beatles]]'', ST 2309 (Stereo), 1 August 1968

===Canadian compilations=== 
All post-Beatles albums were released exactly the same in Canada as in the U.S., with the exception of:
* ''[[Very Together]]'', Polydor (Fall 1969)
* ''[[The Beatles' Ballads]]'', Capitol Records (1980-10-13)

===Canadian singles===
This reflects the Beatles singles which appeared on the "[[CHUM Chart|CHUM Hit Parade]]" charts between the weeks of Monday 6 January 1963 and Saturday 8 January 1977.<ref>[http://www.1050chum.com/index_chumcharts.aspx?artist=7600 1050 CHUM - CHUM Charts<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>  Capitol of Canada took on the Beatles early on and issued early singles in their 72000 series of Canada only releases<ref>[http://www.capitol6000.com/protected/7200045s.htm The 72000 Series Of 45 RPM Vinyl Discs<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> before aligning with the American company's numbering system when the American company began issuing Beatle singles. American Beatle recordings issued on the Vee-Jay, Swan and Tollie labels were issued by Capitol of Canada with 72000 series catalogue numbers. Capitol Canada was the only country outside of the U.K. to issue version 1 of "Love Me Do" with Ringo on the drums.

==Christmas records==
The Beatles also recorded annual Christmas records for their fan club members. From 1963 to 1969 these were released as 7" flexidiscs on LYN. In 1970 the 7 previous records were put onto a 12" vinyl record, ''[[The Beatles' Christmas Album|From Then to You]]''.  In the United States, the 1964 and 1965 Christmas records were not released.  In 1964, American fans received an edited copy of the 1963 record.  In 1965, instead of a Christmas record, American fans received a postcard saying, "Seasons Greetings from the Beatles."  Nothing was sent to American fans in 1963.  These remain largely unavailable today (although they have been widely bootlegged), with the exception of one track, "Christmas Time Is Here Again", which was edited and released on the ''Free As a Bird'' CD single in 1994:  
*''The Beatles Christmas Record'', LYN 492 (1963)
*''Season's Greetings from The Beatles'', LYN 757 (1964)
*''The Beatles 3rd Christmas Record'', LYN 948 (1965)

===U.S. sales===

The Beatles are the highest-selling act in the United States - according to the [[RIAA]]. Strangely though, by 1990, some twenty-six years after their debut, their U.S. tally stood at just 13.5x platinum (based on 25 certified recordings).
