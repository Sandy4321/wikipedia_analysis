The '''Allegheny County Library Association''' (ACLA) is an organization based in Western Pennsylvania that strives to provide Allegheny County's residents with the premier library system in the state.  Formed in 1991, as an effort to encourage county libraries to collaborate and share resources, ACLA became recognized as a non-profit in 1994.  ACLA is based in Pittsburgh's West End neighborhood.

ACLA's stated mission is to pursue, provide and promote the highest quality public library service possible for all residents of Allegheny County through collaboration, cooperation and coordination.  ACLA has 44 member libraries.<ref>{{cite web | url =http://www.einetwork.net/acla/home/about.cfm | title =About ACLA | publisher =AcLA | accessdate =2007-08-23}}</ref>

==History of ACLA==

ACLA's story begins in 1991 when the Allegheny County Controller's office issued a special report entitled, "A Quiet Crisis: Libraries in Allegheny County".<ref name="History">{{cite web | url =http://www.einetwork.net/acla/home/history.cfm | title =History | publisher =AcLA | accessdate =2007-08-23}}</ref>  The report detailed the dismal state of county libraries and challenged the library community to improve service and increase funding. At that point in time, libraries worked independently of one another. There was little to no cooperation across municipal borders. Libraries were urged to coordinate and cooperate. ACLA was created in response to the call to action. As a result, libraries now have experienced significant funding increases along with providing quality library service.  

=== Accomplishments since "A Quiet Crisis" was released ===

The former Allegheny County Commissioners immediately appointed a Commission on the Future of Libraries in Allegheny County (CFLAC) with Frank Lucchino (former Controller) as Chair. The Commission was charged with working from within county government to address the issues highlighted in the report. 

In 1992 libraries formed a voluntary association called CLASP (County Library Association Serving the People). CLASP promoted communication among libraries and worked within the library community to address the issues highlighted in "A Quiet Crisis". 

In 1992, through the support of the Buhl Foundation, a County Library Director was hired. After three years, Allegheny County directly funded the position. This position served to assist libraries in coordinating their efforts countywide. 

In 1993 State legislation was passed allowing the establishment of the Allegheny Regional Asset District (ARAD). Through an additional 1% sales tax collected in the county, funds were made available to support regional assets. The Carnegie Library of Pittsburgh's operating funds from the city and county were replaced by ARAD funds. County libraries collectively lobbied the ARAD as a regional asset and secured contractual funding in the amount of $5,000,000 per year as supplemental to local government support. 

In 1994 CLASP registered as a nonprofit corporation. As the acronym CLASP had previously been claimed, CLASP became ACLA (the Allegheny County Library Association). The county provided administrative oversight for ACLA by contract through the office of the County Library Director. 

In 1995 ACLA, the Carnegie Library of Pittsburgh, and the Commission on the Future of Libraries partnered to develop the Electronic Information network (eiNetwork). The eiNetwork was launched in 1996 with capital investments from the foundation community, Allegheny County, and ACLA, establishing a common automation system for libraries throughout the County. One library is not linked to the eiNetwork and maintains a stand-alone system: Monroeville Public Library. Upper St. Clair Library completed a system conversion process (July 2006) and is now part of the system. The Allegheny Regional Asset District, ACLA, and the Carnegie Library of Pittsburgh continue to sustain the operating costs of the network. 

In 1997 ACLA voted to amend its bylaws and reorganize its board structure to qualify as a federated library system. By doing so ACLA began receiving direct funding from the State in 1998 and became eligible for state grants. In 1999 ACLA hired the County Library Director as its full time executive director, thus consolidating oversight of library services within the organization. 

In 1999 the State legislature passed significant increases in State Aid funding. 

In 2002, ACLA acquired legal ownership of bookmobile operations from the Carnegie Library of Pittsburgh. 

In 2003, the state legislature passed a 34% cut in library funding. Significant service reductions have been implemented in libraries in Allegheny County and across the Commonwealth. 

From 2004 <U+2013> 2006 there have been increased services and training for members of the Association.  Board Governance training, Library Director Leadership training and continuing education on advancing library technology and customer service have helped to strengthen the ACLA libraries.  Shared programming, arts programming and a literacy initiative have helped bring information and the entertainment to library locations throughout Allegheny County.  

In the year 2006 two studies were commissioned by ACLA to improve and bolster customer service.  One study was on service delivery to Knowledge Connections sites and the other was a county-wide patron satisfaction survey.  In both instances, information acquired from these studies will help generate new and improved services to the public and help us broaden the library mission that Andrew Carnegie passionately espoused at end of the 1800<U+2019>s.  Library 2.0 and increasing library user input will help fashion the library of the twenty first century.

In less than 15 years, through coordination and cooperation, and in spite of state finding cuts, library funding in Allegheny County has increased by over 70% (more than $15 million)! The eiNetwork is the nation's premier network of its kind. Library service has been extended into new areas with 10 branches of county libraries and thirteen Knowledge Connections in public housing communities.    What was once a quiet crisis has become a quiet success.<ref name="History" />
