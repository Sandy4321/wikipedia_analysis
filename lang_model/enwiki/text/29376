'''''I Am Legend''''' is a [[2007 in film|2007]] [[Apocalyptic and post-apocalyptic fiction|post-apocalyptic]] [[science fiction film|science fiction]] [[horror film]] directed by [[Francis Lawrence]] and starring [[Will Smith]]. It is the third feature film adaptation of [[Richard Matheson|Richard Matheson's]] 1954 novel ''[[I Am Legend]]'', following 1964's ''[[The Last Man on Earth (1964 film)|The Last Man on Earth]]'' and 1971's ''[[The Omega Man]]''.<ref>{{cite news | url= http://www.variety.com/review/VE1117935602.html | title=I Am Legend review | author=Todd McCarthy | publisher=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] | date=2007-12-07 | accessdate=2007-12-18}}</ref>

Smith plays [[virology|virologist]] Robert Neville, who thinks he may be Earth's only surviving human not affected by a vicious man-made virus. He works to create a cure while living in a city inhabited by mutant victims of the airborn virus. 

[[Warner Bros. Pictures]] began developing ''I Am Legend'' in 1994, and various actors and directors were attached to the project, though production was delayed due to budgetary concerns related to the script. Production began in 2006 in [[New York City]], filming mainly on location in the city, including a $5 million scene at the [[Brooklyn Bridge]], the most expensive scene ever filmed in the city at the time. Warner Bros. launched a tie-in comic and an online multiplayer game on ''[[Second Life]]'' as part of its marketing campaign. ''I Am Legend'' was released on [[December 14]] [[2007]] in the [[United States]]. It opened to the largest ever [[box office]] for a non-Christmas film released in the U.S. during December.

==Plot==
<!-- Keep this short please, this shouldn't contain all details of the film. -->
<!-- Leave Real-World Perspective in place per MoS (see Wikipedia:Manual of Style (writing about fiction)#Real-world perspective --> 
After the outbreak of a lethal virus in 2009, [[United States Army|US Army]] virologist [[Lieutenant Colonel (United States)|Lieutenant Colonel]] Robert Neville ([[Will Smith]]) is left as the last healthy human in [[New York City]] and possibly the entire world.

Opening in 2012, a series of [[flashback]]s and recorded news programs reveal that in 2009 a genetically re-engineered [[measles]] [[virus]], originally created as a cure for [[cancer]], mutated into a lethal strain which rapidly infected humans and some species of animals. By the end of the year over 90% of the planet's human population died. Over 9% were [[infection|infected]], but did not die. These survivors degenerated into a primal state of aggression and began to react painfully to [[UV radiation]], forcing them to hide in buildings and other dark places during the day. Less than 1% remained completely immune to the virus, but were hunted and killed by the infected or committed [[suicide]] due to their isolation until, three years after the outbreak, Robert Neville is left as what he believes to be the last healthy human in the world.

Neville's daily routine includes experimentation to find a cure for the virus and trips through a [[Manhattan]] devoid of humanity to hunt for food and supplies. He also waits each day for a response to his continuous recorded radio broadcasts, which instruct any uninfected survivors to meet him at midday at the [[South Street Seaport]]. Flashbacks reveal that his wife and daughter appear to have died in a helicopter accident during the chaotic evacuation of Manhattan, prior to the military-enforced [[quarantine]] of the island in 2009. Neville's isolation is broken only by the companionship of his dog Samantha ("Sam"), interaction with [[mannequins]] he has set up as patrons of a video store, and recordings of old news and entertainment broadcasts.

<!--all edits to trap section need to be [[WP:SYNTH]] free. Please do not speculate on who set the second trap and motives of the infected-->
Neville seems to find a promising treatment derived from his own blood, so he sets a [[Animal trapping#Snares|snare trap]] and captures an infected woman while an infected male watches from the shadows. Back in his laboratory, located in the basement of his heavily-fortified [[Washington Square Park, New York|Washington Square Park]] home, Neville treats the infected woman without success. Shortly thereafter, he is ensnared in a trap similar to the one he used to capture the woman. By the time Neville escapes it is dark and he is attacked by infected dogs, one of which bites Sam (although dogs are unaffected by the airborne strain of the virus, they are still affected by the contact strain). Initially Neville brings Sam home and injects her with a strand of his serum, but when she shows signs of infection and tries to attack him Neville is forced to strangle her. The next night he goes out and recklessly attacks a group of infected. He is nearly killed, but is rescued by a pair of immune survivors, Anna ([[Alice Braga]]) and a young boy named Ethan (Charlie Tahan), who have traveled from [[Maryland]] after hearing one of his broadcasts. They take the injured Neville back to his home where Anna explains that they survived the outbreak aboard a [[Red Cross]] evacuation ship from [[S<U+00E3>o Paulo]] and are making their way to a putative survivors' camp in [[Bethel, Vermont]].

Neville once again attempts to administer a potential cure to the infected woman in his laboratory, but the next night a group of infected, who had followed Anna and Neville back the night before, attack the house and overrun its defenses. Neville, Anna, and Ethan retreat into the basement laboratory, sealing themselves in with the woman Neville has been treating. Discovering that the last treatment has been successful, Neville draws a vial of the woman's blood and gives it to Anna. He pushes Anna and Ethan into an old coal chute, and then [[sacrifices]] himself to save their lives, using a [[hand grenade]] to kill himself and the attacking infected.

Anna and Ethan escape to Vermont, and locate the survivors' colony, where Anna hands over the cure. In the closing [[voice-over]], she states that Neville's cure enabled humanity to survive and rebuild, establishing his legend. The movie ends with Anna quoting [[Bob Marley]]: "Three Little Birds".

In March 2002, Schwarzenegger became the producer of ''I Am Legend'', commencing negotiations with [[Michael Bay]] to direct and [[Will Smith]] to star in the film.

When delays occurred on Will Smith's film ''[[Hancock (film)|Hancock]]'' (2008), which was scheduled for 2007, it was proposed to switch the actor's films.

===Casting===

[This] always felt like it had those possibilities to me."<ref name=ew/> The actor found Neville to be his toughest acting challenge since portraying [[Muhammad Ali]] in ''[[Ali (film)|Ali]]'' (2001). He said that "when you're on your own, it is kind of hard to find conflict." The film's dark tone and exploration of whether Neville has gone insane during his isolation meant Smith had to restrain himself from falling into a humorous routine during takes.<ref name=empire>{{cite news | author = Ian Nathan | title = I Am Legend | publisher = [[Empire (magazine)|Empire]] | date = October 2007 | pages = 78-81}}</ref>  To prepare for his role, Smith visited the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] in [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]]. He also met with a person who had been in [[solitary confinement]] and a former [[prisoner of war]].<ref name=china/>  Smith compared Neville to [[Job (Bible)|Job]], who lost his children, livelihood and health. Like the [[Book of Job]], ''I Am Legend'' studies the questions, "Can he find a reason to continue? Can he find the hope or desire to excel and advance in life? Or does the death of everything around him create imminent death for himself?"<ref name=latimes/> He also cited an influence in [[Tom Hanks]]' performance in ''[[Cast Away]]'' (2000).<ref name=ew/>

Abbey, a three-year-old [[German Shepherd]], played Neville's dog Sam.

===Filming===
[[Image:Brooklyn Bridge - New York City.jpg|thumb|The [[Brooklyn Bridge]] served as a location in ''I Am Legend'', at which there was a $5 million scene filmed, the most expensive scene to date in [[New York City]].]]
[[Akiva Goldsman]] decided to move the story from Los Angeles to [[New York City]] to take advantage of locations that would more easily show emptiness.<ref name="variation" /> Goldsman explained, "[[Los Angeles, California|L.A.]] looks empty at three o'clock in the afternoon, [but] New York is never empty . . . it was a much more interesting way of showing the windswept emptiness of the world."<ref name=empire/> Warner Bros. initially rejected this idea because of the logistics,<ref name=nytimes/> but Francis Lawrence was determined to shoot on location, to give the film a natural feel that would not benefit from shooting on soundstages. Lawrence went to the city with a [[camcorder]], and filmed areas filled with crowds. Then, a special effects test was conducted to remove all those people. The test had a powerful effect on studio executives.<ref name=empire2>{{cite news | author = Ian Nathan | title = Last Man Standing | publisher = [[Empire (magazine)|Empire]] | date = January 2008 | pages = 109-114}}</ref> Michael Tadross convinced authorities to close busy areas such as the [[Grand Central Terminal]] [[viaduct]], several blocks of [[Fifth Avenue]] and [[Washington Square Park]].<ref name=nytimes/> The film was shot primarily in 35mm [[anamorphic format]], with flashback scenes shot in [[Super 35]].{{Fact|date=January 2008}}

Filming began on [[September 23]] [[2006]].<ref name="taking">{{cite news | author=Garth Franklin | url=http://www.darkhorizons.com/news06/060816i.php | title="I Am Legend" Taking Time To Film | publisher=Dark Horizons | date=[[2006-08-16]] | accessdate=2006-08-23 }}</ref> The Marcy Avenue Armory in Williamsburg was used for the interior of Neville's home,<ref name=empire/> while [[Greenwich Village]] was used for the exterior.<ref name=latimes>{{cite news | author = Chris Lee | title = Will Smith: a one-man show | publisher = [[Los Angeles Times]] | date = [[2007-11-04]] | url = http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/movies/la-ca-smith4nov04,1,783335.story?ctrack=5&cset=true | accessdate=2007-11-06}}</ref> Other locations include the Tribeca section of Lower Manhattan, the aircraft carrier ''[[Intrepid Sea-Air-Space Museum|Intrepid]]'', the Kingsbridge Armory in the Bronx and St. Patrick's Cathedral.<ref name="variation" /> Weeds were imported from [[Florida]] and were strewn across locations to make the city look like it had overgrown with them.<ref name=nytimes/> The closure of major streets was controversial with New Yorkers. Will Smith said, "I don't think anyone's going to be able to do that in New York again any time soon. People were not happy. That's the most middle fingers I've ever gotten in my career."<ref name=latimes/>

A bridge scene was filmed for six consecutive nights in January on the [[Brooklyn Bridge]] to serve as a flashback scene in which New York's citizens evacuate the city. Shooting the scene consumed $5 million of the film's reported $150 million budget, which was the most expensive shot in the city to date. The scene, which had to meet requirements from fourteen government agencies, involved 250 crew members and 1,000 extras, including 160 National Guard members.<ref>{{cite news | author=Joseph Steuer | url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/content_display/television/features/e3i75150efee777f4aeaf5bf8e90b207030 | title=A 'Legend' in the making | publisher=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] | date=[[2007-04-24]] | accessdate=2007-04-26 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news | last = Addiego | first = Walter | url= http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2007/12/14/DDCFTTNAT.DTL | title = Review: I, human - Will Smith plays last man standing in 'I Am Legend' | publisher = [[San Francisco Chronicle]] | date=[[2007-12-14]] | accessdate=2007-12-22 }}</ref> Also present were several [[High Mobility Multipurpose Wheeled Vehicle|Humvees]], three [[Stryker (vehicle)|Stryker]] armored vehicles, a 110-foot [[United States Coast Guard Cutter|cutter]], a 41-foot [[USCG Utility Boat|utility boat]], and two 25-foot Response Boat Small craft, as well as other vehicles including taxis, police cars, fire trucks, and ambulances.<ref name="Reuters">{{cite news | author=Joseph Steuer | url=http://www.reuters.com/article/filmNews/idUSN2335654320070424 | title=Government agencies cover filmmakers in red tape | publisher=[[Reuters]] | date=[[2007-04-24]] | accessdate=2007-09-17 }}</ref> Filming concluded on [[March 31]] [[2007]].<ref name="taking" />

Reshoots were conducted around November 2007. Lawrence noted, "We weren't seeing fully-rendered shots until about a month ago. The movie starts to take on a whole other life. It's not only until later that you can judge a movie as a whole and go, 'Huh, maybe we should shoot this little piece in the middle, or tweak this a little bit.' It just so happened that our re-shoots revolved around the end of the movie."<ref>{{cite news | title = Francis Lawrence on I Am Legend Re-shoots | publisher = ShockTillYouDrop.com | date = [[2007-12-03]] | url = http://www.shocktillyoudrop.com/news/topnews.php?id=3861 | accessdate=2007-12-03}}</ref>

===Effects===
A week into filming, Francis Lawrence felt the infected, who were being portrayed by actors wearing prosthetics, were not convincing. His decision to use [[computer-generated imagery]] (CGI) meant post-production had to be extended and the budget increased. Lawrence explained, "They needed to have an abandon in their performance that you just can<U+2019>t get out of people in the middle of the night when they<U+2019>re [[Barefoot running|barefoot]]. And their metabolisms are really spiked, so they<U+2019>re constantly [[hyperventilating]], which you can<U+2019>t really get actors to do for a long time or they pass out."<ref name=nytimes/> While the infected become [[vampire]]s in the novel, the film script avoids such a direct reference;<ref name=ew/> even though the character Anna calls them "dark seekers", and they consume living flesh, their design is inspired more by the concept of their [[adrenal gland]]s being open all the time than by conventional vampire imagery. The actors remained on set to provide [[motion capture]].<ref name=empire/> "The film's producers and sound people wanted the creatures in the movie to sound somewhat human, but not the standard," so [[Mike Patton]], former lead singer of [[Alternative rock|Alternative rock band]] [[Faith No More]], was engaged to provide all of the infecteds' screams and howls.<ref>{{cite news | last = Harris | first = Chris | title = Mike Patton Hits The Big Screen, Voicing 'I Am Legend' Baddies And Scoring 'Perfect' Indie Flick | publisher = MTV Networks | date = [[2007-12-13]] | url = http://www.mtv.com/movies/news/articles/1576342/story.jhtml | accessdate=2008-01-03}}</ref>

In addition, CGI was used for the [[lion]]s and [[deer]] in the film, and to [[rotoscoping|erase]] pedestrians in shots of New York. Workers visible in windows, spectators and moving cars in the distance were all removed. In his vision of an empty New York, Lawrence cited [[John Ford]] as his influence: "We didn't want to make an apocalyptic movie where the landscape felt apocalyptic. A lot of the movie takes place on a beautiful day. There's something magical about the empty city as opposed to dark and scary."<ref name=ew/>

Keen-eyed viewers have spotted billboards advertising a number of imaginary movies based on [[DC Comics]] properties in the background of some shots.<ref name="timesonline">{{cite news | author=Michael Moran | title=The hidden secrets of I Am Legend | publisher=[[Times Online]] | date=[[2008-01-08]] | url = http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/film/article3151905.ece }}</ref>

=== Alternative ending ===

The tone of the ending of the film was altered dramatically before the film's release, with the majority of the changes made to the standoff between Neville and the infected in his laboratory. Visual effects supervisor Janek Sirrs recounts the original ending starting with the standoff, "At that point, Neville's<U+2014>and the audience's<U+2014>assumptions about the nature of these creatures are shown to be incorrect. We see that they have actually retained some of their humanity. There is a very important moment between the alpha male and Neville." David Schaub stated, "Then, when Neville finally turns the alpha female over to the alpha male, there is this little love moment between the two of them." The infected then retrieve the captured female and spare Neville's life. The original final shot follows Neville, Anna, and Ethan as they cross the remnants of the [[George Washington Bridge]] in hopes of finding other survivors.<ref>{{Cite journal | last = Duncan | first = Jody | title = Urban Legend | journal = [[Cinefex]] | volume = 112 | pages = 118}}</ref> This ending will be used in the DVD release.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.omelete.com.br/cine/100010361/Omelete_Entrevista__Francis_Lawrence__o_diretor_de_Eu_Sou_a_Lenda.aspx|title=Omelete entrevista Francis Lawrence|publisher=Omelete|language=Portuguese|accessdate=2008-01-24|date=2008-01-18|quote=We have a few scenes that won't be in the first release, but in the second.

[[A. O. Scott]] felt Will Smith gave a "graceful and effortless performance", and also noted the "third-act collapse". He felt the movie "does ponder some pretty deep questions about the collapse and persistence of human civilization".<ref>{{cite news | author=[[A. O.

''[[Popular Mechanics]]'' published an article on [[December 14]], [[2007]] <ref>{{Citation | last= McCarthy | first= Erin | author-link=
| publication-date= [[2007-12-14]] | title= I Am Legend's Junk Science: Hollywood Sci-Fi vs. Reality | periodical= [[Popular Mechanics]] | url= http://www.popularmechanics.com/science/worst_case_scenarios/4236920.html?page=1 | accessdate= 2007-12-29}}</ref> addressing some of the scientific issues raised by the film:
# the rate of deterioration of urban structures, [[infrastructure]], and survival of [[fauna]] and [[flora]]
# Neville's power supplies
# the plausibility of a [[retrovirus]] spreading out of control as depicted in the film
# the mechanics of the Brooklyn Bridge's destruction
The magazine solicited reactions from author [[Alan Weisman]], virologist W. Ian Lipkin, [[Doctor of Medicine|M.D.]], and Michel Bruneau, [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]], comparing their predictions with the film's depictions. The article raised the most questions regarding the virus' mutation and the medical results, and pointed out that a [[suspension bridge]] like the Brooklyn Bridge would likely completely collapse rather than losing only its middle span. Neville's method of producing power using gasoline-powered generators seemed the most credible: "This part of the tale is possible, if not entirely likely", ''Popular Mechanics'' editor Roy Berendsohn says.

''I Am Legend'' earned four nominations for the [[Visual Effects Society|VES Awards]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.visualeffectssociety.com/downloads/NomineesPressRelease2008.pdf|title=VISUAL EFFECTS SOCIETY (VES) ANNOUNCES NOMINEES FOR 6TH ANNUAL VES AWARDS |publisher=[[Visual Effects Society]]|accessdate=2008-01-23}}</ref> and was also nominated for Outstanding Performance by a [[Stunt double|Stunt]] Ensemble at the [[Screen Actors Guild Awards]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sagawards.org/PR_071220|title=NOMINATIONS ANNOUNCED FOR THE 14th ANNUAL SCREEN ACTORS GUILD AWARDS<U+00AE>|publisher=[[Screen Actors Guild]]|date=2007-12-20|accessdate=2008-01-23}}</ref> Outstanding Film and Actor at the [[Image Awards]],<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.naacpimageawards.net/PDFs/NOMINEES_FOR_39TH_NAACP_IMAGE_AWARDS_ANNOUNCED.pdf|title=NOMINEES_FOR_39TH_NAACP_IMAGE_AWARDS_ANNOUNCED|publisher=[[National Association for the Advancement of Colored People|NAACP]]|accessdate=2008-01-23}}</ref> and Best Sound at the [[Satellite Awards]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pressacademy.com/satawards/awards2007.shtml|title=2007 12th Annual SATELLITE<U+2122> Awards|publisher=[[International Press Academy]]|accessdate=2008-01-23}}</ref>
