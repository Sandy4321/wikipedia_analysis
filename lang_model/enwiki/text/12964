{{Campaignbox Bosnian War}}

The '''Croat<U+2013>Bosniak War''' was a conflict between the [[Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina]] and the self-proclaimed [[Croatian Community of Herzeg-Bosnia]] supported by the [[Republic of Croatia]], that lasted from June 19, 1992<ref name="Kordi<U+0107> and <U+010C>erkez judgement 153">[[#Kordi<U+0107> and <U+010C>erkez judgement|Kordi<U+0107> and <U+010C>erkez judgement]], p. 153</ref> <U+2013> February 23, 1994, caused by the [[Kara<U+0111>or<U+0111>evo agreement|Kara<U+0111>or<U+0111>evo]] and [[Graz agreement]]s and the previously-unified Croat forces turning on the Bosniaks.<ref>Silber, L (1997), ''Yugoslavia: Death of a Nation''.

There are no precise statistics dealing with the casualties of the Croat-Bosniak conflict along ethnic lines. The Sarajevo-based Research and Documentation Center's (IDC) data from 2007 on human losses in the regions caught in the Croat-Bosniak conflict as part of the wider Bosnian War, however, can serve as a rough [[approximation]]. According to this data, in Central Bosnia most of the 10,448 documented casualties (soldiers and civilians) were [[Bosniaks]] (62%), with [[Croats]] in second (24%) and [[Serbs]] (13%) in third place. The municipalities of [[Gornji Vakuf-Uskoplje]] and [[Bugojno]] also geographically located in Central Bosnia, with the 1,337 documented casualties are not included in Central Bosnia statistics, but in [[Vrbas (river)|Vrbas]] region statistics. Approximately 70-80% of the casualties from Gornje Povrbasje were Bosniaks. In the region of [[Neretva]] river of 6,717 casualties, 54% were Bosniaks, 24% Serbs and 21% Croats. The casualties in those regions were mostly but not exclusively the consequence of Croat-Bosniak conflict. To a lesser extent the conflict with the Serbs also resulted in a number of casualties included in the statistics.<ref>RDC - Research results (2007) - Human Losses in Bosnia and Herzegovina 1991-1995 [http://www.idc.org.ba/presentation/research_results.htm]</ref>

==Background==
{{Main|Bosnian War}}

During the [[Yugoslav Wars]], the objectives of [[nationalist]]s from Croatia were shared by Croat nationalists in [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]].<ref name="ICTY: Bla<U+0161>ki<U+0107> verdict - A. The Lasva Valley: May 1992 <U+2013> January 1993">{{cite web|url=http://www.icty.org/x/cases/blaskic/tjug/en/bla-tj000303e.pdf|title=ICTY: Bla<U+0161>ki<U+0107> verdict - A. The Lasva Valley: May 1992 <U+2013> January 1993t}}</ref> The ruling party in the [[Republic of Croatia]], the [[Croatian Democratic Union]] (HDZ), organized and controlled the branch of the party in Bosnia and Herzegovina. By the latter part of 1991, the more extreme elements of the party, under the leadership of [[Mate Boban]], [[Dario Kordi<U+0107>]], [[Jadranko Prli<U+0107>]], Ignac Ko<U+0161>troman and local leaders such as Anto Valenta,<ref name="ICTY: Bla<U+0161>ki<U+0107> verdict - A.

Following the declaration of [[independence]], the Serbs attacked different parts of [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]]. The state administration of Bosnia and Herzegovina effectively ceased to function having lost control over the entire territory. The Croats and their leader [[Franjo Tu<U+0111>man]] also aimed at securing parts of Bosnia and Herzegovina as Croatian. Secret discussions between Franjo Tu<U+0111>man and [[Slobodan Milo<U+0161>evi<U+0107>]] on the division of Bosnia and Herzegovina were held as early as March 1991 known as the [[Kara<U+0111>or<U+0111>evo agreement]]. The policies of the Republic of Croatia and its leader Franjo Tu<U+0111>man towards Bosnia and Herzegovina were never totally transparent and always included Franjo Tu<U+0111>man<U+2019>s ultimate aim of expanding Croatia<U+2019>s borders.<ref name="ICTY: Naletili<U+0107> and Martinovi<U+0107> verdict - A.

Historical background}}</ref>

On November 12, 1991, numerous leading members of the Bosnian HDZ drafted a document that stated, among other things, that "[...] the Croat people in Bosnia-Herzegovina must finally undertake a decisive and active policy that should bring about the realisation of our centuries-old dream: a common Croatian state." It was signed by [[Mate Boban]], [[Vladimir <U+0160>olji<U+0107>]], [[Bo<U+017E>o Rai<U+0107>]], [[Ivan Bender]], [[Pero Markovi<U+0107>]], [[Dario Kordi<U+0107>]] and others.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Plans for a 'Greater Croatia' (document)|journal=Bosnian Report|year=1997|month=November - December|series=1|url=http://www.bosnia.org.uk/bosrep/report_format.cfm?articleID=2910&reportid=119|publisher=Bosnian Institute}}</ref><ref>[[#Kordi<U+0107> and <U+010C>erkez judgement|Kordi<U+0107> and <U+010C>erkez judgement]], p. 348</ref> On November 18, 1991, the party branch in Bosnia and Herzegovina, proclaimed the existence of the Croatian Community of Herzeg-Bosnia, as a separate "political, cultural, economic and territorial whole," on the territory of Bosnia and Herzegovina.<ref name="ICTY: Prli<U+0107> et al.

In January 1992, Tu<U+0111>man arranged for [[Stjepan Kljui<U+0107>]], president of the Bosnian branch of the HDZ who favored cooperating with the Bosniaks towards a unified Bosnian state, to be ousted and replaced by [[Mate Boban]], who favored Croatia to annex Croat-inhabited parts of Bosnia and Herzegovina.<ref name="Ramet 2006 p. 434">[[#Ramet 2006|Ramet (2006)]], p. 434</ref>

On 9 May 1992, Karad<U+017E>i<U+0107> and Boban met in [[Graz]] and formed an [[Graz agreement|agreement]] on the division of Bosnia and Herzegovina.<ref>{{cite news|last=Williams|first=Carol J.|title=Serbs, Croats Met Secretly to Split Bosnia|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1992-05-09/news/mn-1603_1_united-states|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=9 May 1992}}</ref><ref>[[#Lukic 1996|Lukic (1996)]], pp. 210-212</ref> In the same month Major General Ante Roso declared that the HVO was only legal military force in Herzeg-Bosnia (what the HVO referred to areas under their control) and stated that "all orders from TO [Territorial Defence] command (of Bosnia and Herzegovina are invalid, and are to be considered illegal on this territory.<ref name="Ramet 2006 p. 436">[[#Ramet 2006|Ramet (2006)]], p. 436</ref> This subsequently broke Croat-Bosniak relations in Bosnia and Herzegovina and between the states of the Republic of Croatia and the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina.<ref name=lukic/>

On April 10, 1992, Mate Boban decreed that the Bosnian Territorial Defence (TO), which had been created the day before, was illegal on self-proclaimed Croat territory. On May 11, [[Tihomir Bla<U+0161>ki<U+0107>]] declared the TO illegal on the territory of the [[Kiseljak]] municipality.<ref name="ICTY: Bla<U+0161>ki<U+0107> verdict - A. The Lasva Valley: May 1992 <U+2013> January 1993"/>

In June 1992 the focus switched to [[Novi Travnik]] and [[Gornji Vakuf]] where the Croat Defence Council (HVO) efforts to gain control were resisted. On June 18, 1992 the Bosnian Territorial Defence in Novi Travnik received an [[ultimatum]] from the HVO which included demands to abolish existing Bosnia and Herzegovina institutions, establish the authority of the Croatian Community of Herzeg-Bosnia and pledge allegiance to it, subordinate the Territorial Defense to the HVO and expel Muslim refugees, all within 24 hours. The attack was launched on June 19. The elementary school and the Post Office were attacked and damaged.<ref name="Kordi<U+0107> and <U+010C>erkez judgement 153"/> Armed incidents started to occur among Croats in Bosnia and Herzegovina in the summer of 1992 between the HVO and the HOS.<ref name=lukic>[[#Lukic 1996|Lukic (1996)]], pp. 212, 215</ref> The HVO favoured an ethnic partition of the republic while the HOS fought together with the Muslims for the territorial integrity of the state.<ref name=lukic/> On 9 August 1992, Bla<U+017E> Kraljevi<U+0107>, leader of the Croatian Defence Forces, and eight of his staff were assassinated by members of HVO under the command of [[Mladen Naletili<U+0107>]] and lead to the dissolution of the primary group in support of a Bosniak-Croat alliance.<ref name="Ramet 2006 p. 434"/><ref name=lukic/>

On 6 July 1992, the [[Croatian Community of Herzeg-Bosnia]] was formally declared as an independent state by Boban. Izetbegovi<U+0107> previously came under intense pressure from Tu<U+0111>man to agree for Bosnia and Herzegovina to be in a [[confederation]] with Croatia. Because doing so would cripple reconciliation between Bosniaks and Serbs, make the return of Bosniak refugees to eastern Bosnia impossible and for other reasons, Izetbegovi<U+0107> opposed. Two weeks prior Boban's declaration, Izetbegovi<U+0107> received an ultimatum from Boban warning that if he did not proclaim a confederation with Tu<U+0111>man that Croatian forces would not help defend Sarajevo from strongholds as close as 25 miles away.<ref>{{cite news|last=Burns|first=John F.|title=Croats Claim Their Own Slice of Bosnia|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1992/07/06/world/croats-claim-their-own-slice-of-bosnia.html?scp=9&sq=boban+bosnia&st=cse&pagewanted=all|newspaper=New York Times|date=6 July 1992}}</ref> Ironically two weeks later on 21 July 1992, Tu<U+0111>man and Izetbegovi<U+0107> signed a pact which placed the HVO under the command of Bosnian Territorial Defence Forces.<ref>[[#Ramet 2002|Ramet (2002)]], p. 211</ref><ref name="Ramet 2006 p. 463">[[#Ramet 2006|Ramet (2006)]], p. 463</ref>

On 7 September 1992, HVO demanded that the Bosniak militiamen withdraw from Croatian suburbs of Stup, Bare, Azi<U+0107>i, Otes, Dogladi and parts of Nedzarici in Sarajevo and issued an ultimatum.<ref>{{cite news|last=Sudetic|first=Chuck|title=Croatians Insist Muslim Fighters Leave Sarajevo Buffer Area|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1992/09/07/world/croatians-insist-muslim-fighters-leave-sarajevo-buffer-area.html|newspaper=New York Times|date=7 September 1992}}</ref> They denied that it was a general threat to Bosnian government forces throughout the country and claimed that Bosniak militiamen killed six of their soldiers, and looted and torched houses in Stup. The Bosniaks stated that the local Croatian warlord made an arrangement with Serb commanders to allow Serb and Croat civilians to be evacuated, often for ransom, but not Bosniaks.<ref>{{cite news|last=Sudetic|first=Chuck|title=Croatian Militia Denies Issuing a Broad Challenge to Bosnia|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1992/09/08/world/croatian-militia-denies-issuing-a-broad-challenge-to-bosnia.html|newspaper=New York Times|date=8 September 1992}}</ref> At the end of September, Tu<U+0111>man and Izetbegovi<U+0107> met to discuss the possibility of establishing military coordination against Bosnian Serb forces.<ref name="Ramet 2006 p. 463"/>

The situation became more serious in October 1992 when Croat forces attacked Bosniak civilian population in [[Prozor, Bosnia and Herzegovina|Prozor]] burning their homes and killing civilians. According to ''[[Jadranko Prli<U+0107>]] indictment'', HVO forces cleansed most of the Muslims from the town of Prozor and several surrounding villages.<ref name="ICTY: Prli<U+0107> et al.

In the latter half of 1992, foreign [[Bosnian Mujahideen|Mujahideen]] hailing mainly from [[North Africa]] and the [[Middle East]] began to arrive in central Bosnia and set up camps for combatant training with the intent of helping their "Muslim brothers" against the Serbs.<ref name="ehak">{{cite web |url=http://www.icty.org/x/cases/hadzihasanovic_kubura/cis/en/cis_hadzihasanovic_kubura_en.pdf |title=Case Information Sheet - Had<U+017E>ihasanovi<U+0107> and Kubura |author=International Criminal Tribunal for the for the former Yugoslavia |accessdate=12 April 2012 }}</ref> These foreign volunteers were primarily organized into an umbrella detachment of the [[7th Muslim Brigade]] (made up of native Bosniaks) of the [[Army of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina]] (ARBiH) in [[Zenica]].<ref name="UNHCHR">{{cite web|last=Mazowiecki|first=Tadeusz|title=Fifth periodic report on the situation of human rights in the territory of the former Yugoslavia|url=http://www.unhchr.ch/huridocda/huridoca.nsf/70ef163b25b2333fc1256991004de370/3e70ccf5ab7cd9c9802566710056e56f?OpenDocument|publisher=United Nations - Commission on Human Rights|date=17 November 1993}}</ref> Initially, the Mujahideen gave basic necessities including food to local Muslims.<ref name="ehak"/> When the

By November 1992, the HVO controlled about 20 percent of Bosnia and Herzegovina.<ref name="Ramet 2006 p. 436"/> By December 1992, much of Central Bosnia was in the hands of the Croats. The Croat forces had taken control of the municipalities of the La<U+0161>va Valley and had only met significant opposition in Novi Travnik and [[Ahmi<U+0107>i]].<ref>[[#Kordi<U+0107> and <U+010C>erkez judgement|Kordi<U+0107> and <U+010C>erkez judgement]], p. 170</ref> Bosniak authorities forbade Croats from leaving towns such as Bugojno and Zenica, and would periodically organise exchanges of local Croats for Muslims.<ref name="UNHCHR"/>

The ICTY Trial Chamber in the ''Kordi<U+0107> and <U+010C>erkez case'' decided that the weight of the evidence points clearly to the [[persecution]] of Bosniak civilians in the Central Bosnian municipalities taken over by the Croat forces: [[Busova<U+010D>a]], [[Novi Travnik]], [[Vare<U+0161>]], [[Kiseljak]], [[Vitez]], [[Kre<U+0161>evo]] and [[<U+017D>ep<U+010D>e]]. The persecution followed a consistent pattern in each municipality and demonstrated that the HVO had launched a [[military campaign|campaign]] against the Bosniaks in them<ref>[[#Kordi<U+0107> and <U+010C>erkez judgement|Kordi<U+0107> and <U+010C>erkez judgement]], p. 161</ref> with the hope that the self-proclaimed Croatian Community of Herzeg-Bosnia should secede from Bosnia and Herzegovina and with a view towards unification with Croatia.<ref>[[#Kordi<U+0107> and <U+010C>erkez judgement|Kordi<U+0107> and <U+010C>erkez judgement]], p. 148</ref>

Until 1993 the HVO and the Bosnian Army (ARBiH) had been fighting side by side against the [[Army of Republika Srpska]] (VRS) in some areas of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Even though armed confrontation and events like the [[Toti<U+0107> kidnapping]]s strained the relationship between the HVO and ARBiH, the Croat-Bosniak alliance held in the Biha<U+0107> pocket (northwest Bosnia) and the Bosanska Posavina (north), in which both were heavily outmatched by Serb forces.{{cn|date=February 2013}}

===Gornji Vakuf shelling===
On January 1993 Croat forces attacked Gornji Vakuf again in order to connect [[Herzegovina]] with Central Bosnia.<ref name="ICTY: Prli<U+0107> et al. (IT-04-74)"/> Gornji Vakuf is a [[town]] to the south of the La<U+0161>va Valley and of strategic importance at a [[Junction (road)|crossroad]]s en route to Central Bosnia. It is 48 kilometres from [[Novi Travnik]] and about one hour<U+2019>s drive from [[Vitez]] in an armoured vehicle. For Croats it was a very important connection between the La<U+0161>va Valley and [[Herzegovina]], two territories included in the self-proclaimed [[Croatian Community of Herzeg-Bosnia]]. The Croat forces shelling reduced much of the historical oriental center of the town of Gornji Vakuf to rubble.<ref name="ICTY: Kordi<U+0107> and <U+010C>erkez verdict - IV.

On January 10, 1993, just before the outbreak of hostilities in Gornji Vakuf, the Croat Defence Council (HVO) commander Luka <U+0160>ekerija, sent a "Military <U+2013> Top Secret" request to Colonel [[Tihomir Bla<U+0161>ki<U+0107>]] and [[Dario Kordi<U+0107>]], (later convicted by [[ICTY]] of [[war crimes]] and [[crimes against humanity]] i.e. [[ethnic cleansing]]) for rounds of [[Mortar (weapon)|mortar]] [[Shell (projectile)|shell]]s available at the [[ammunition]] [[factory]] in [[Vitez]].<ref>[[#Kordi<U+0107> and <U+010C>erkez judgement|Kordi<U+0107> and <U+010C>erkez judgement]], p. 188</ref> Fighting then broke out in Gornji Vakuf on January 11, 1993, sparked by a bomb which had been placed by Croats in a Bosniak-owned hotel that had been used as a military [[headquarter]]s.

Although Croats often cited it as a major reason for the attack on Gornji Vakuf, the commander of the British Britbat company claimed that there were no Muslim ''holy warriors'' in Gornji Vakuf (commonly known as Mujahideen) and that his soldiers had not seen any.

On the morning of January 25, 1993, Croat forces attacked the Bosniak part of the town of Busova<U+010D>a called Kadi<U+0107>a Strana following the January 20 ultimatum. The attack included [[shelling]] from the surrounding hills. A loudspeaker called on Bosniaks to surrender. A police report shows that 43 people were massacred in Busova<U+010D>a in January and February 1993. The remaining Bosniaks (around 90 in all) were rounded up in the town square. Women and children (around 20 in total) were allowed to return home and the men (70 in all), some as young as 14<U+2013>16 years, were loaded onto [[bus]]es and taken to Kaonik camp. The violence continued after the January attack.<ref>[[#Kordi<U+0107> and <U+010C>erkez judgement|Kordi<U+0107> and <U+010C>erkez judgement]], pp. 183-184</ref>

The [[La<U+0161>va Valley ethnic cleansing]] campaign against Bosniak civilians planned by the [[Croatian Community of Herzeg-Bosnia]]'s [[political]] and [[military]] [[leadership]] from May 1992 to March 1993 and erupting the following April, was meant to implement objectives set forth by Croat [[nationalist]]s in November 1991.<ref name="ICTY: Bla<U+0161>ki<U+0107> verdict - A.

This was often followed by anti-Bosniak [[propaganda]],  particularly in the municipalities of [[Vitez]], [[Busova<U+010D>a]], [[Novi Travnik]] and [[Kiseljak]]. [[Ahmi<U+0107>i massacre]] in April 1993, was the [[culmination]] of the La<U+0161>va Valley ethnic cleansing, resulting in mass killing of Bosnian Muslim civilians in just a few hours. {{Citation needed span|text=An estimate puts the death toll at 120.

===War in Herzegovina===
The [[Croatian Community of Herzeg-Bosnia]] took control of many municipal governments and services in [[Herzegovina]] as well, removing or marginalising local Bosniak leaders. Herzeg-Bosnia took control of the media and imposed Croatian [[idea]]s and [[propaganda]]. Croatian [[symbol]]s and [[currency]] were introduced, and Croatian curricula and the Croatian language were introduced in schools. Many Bosniaks and Serbs were removed from positions in government and private business; humanitarian aid was managed and distributed to the Bosniaks' and Serbs' disadvantage; and Bosniaks in general were increasingly harassed. Many of them were deported into [[concentration camp]]s: [[Heliodrom camp|Heliodrom]], Dretelj, Gabela, Vojno and <U+0160>unje.<ref name="ICTY: Kordi<U+0107> and <U+010C>erkez verdict"/><ref name="ICTY: Bla<U+0161>ki<U+0107> verdict">{{cite web|url=http://www.icty.org/x/cases/blaskic/tjug/en/bla-tj000303e.pdf|title=ICTY: Bla<U+0161>ki<U+0107> verdict}}</ref>{{Failed verification|date=April 2011}}

According to ICTY judgment in ''Naletili<U+0107>-Martinovi<U+0107> case'' Croat forces attacked the villages of Sovici and Doljani, about {{convert|50|km}}  north of Mostar in the morning on April 17, 1993. The attack was part of a larger HVO offensive aimed at taking [[Jablanica, Bosnia and Herzegovina|Jablanica]], the main Bosnian Muslim dominated town in the area. The HVO commanders had calculated that they needed two days to take Jablanica. The location of Sovici was of strategic significance for the HVO as it was on the way to Jablanica. For the Bosnian Army it was a gateway to the plateau of Risovac, which could create conditions for further progression towards the Adriatic coast. The larger HVO offensive on Jablanica had already started on April 15, 1993. The artillery destroyed the upper part of Sovici. The Bosnian Army was fighting back, but at about five p.m. the Bosnian Army commander in Sovici, surrendered. Approximately 70 to 75 soldiers surrendered. In total, at least 400 Bosnian Muslim civilians were detained. The HVO advance towards Jablanica was halted after a cease-fire agreement had been negotiated.<ref>ICTY (Naletilic-Matinovic): 1.

===Siege of Mostar===
[[Mostar]] was surrounded by the Croat forces for nine months, and much of its historic city was severely destroyed in [[shell (projectile)|shell]]ing including the famous [[Stari Most]] bridge.<ref name="ICTY: Prli<U+0107> ''et al.'' (IT-04-74)">{{cite web|url=http://www.icty.org/x/cases/prlic/cis/en/cis_prlic_al_en.pdf|title=ICTY: Prli<U+0107> ''et al.'' (IT-04-74)}}</ref> [[Slobodan Praljak]], the commander of the [[Croatian Defence Council]], is currently on trial at the [[ICTY]] for ordering the destruction of the bridge, among other charges.<ref name="ICTY: Prli<U+0107> ''et al.'' (IT-04-74)"/>

Mostar was divided into a Western part, which was dominated by the Croat forces and an Eastern part where the [[Army of Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina]] was largely concentrated. However, the Bosnian Army had its headquarters in West Mostar in the basement of a building complex referred to as Vranica. In the early hours of May 9, 1993, the Croatian Defence Council attacked Mostar using artillery, mortars, heavy weapons and small arms. The HVO controlled all roads leading into Mostar and international organisations were denied access. Radio Mostar announced that all Bosniaks should hang out a white flag from their windows. The HVO attack had been well prepared and planned.<ref name="ICTY: Naletili<U+0107> and Martinovi<U+0107> verdict">{{cite web|url=http://www.icty.org/x/cases/naletilic_martinovic/tjug/en/nal-tj030331-e.pdf|title=ICTY: Naletili<U+0107> and Martinovi<U+0107> verdict - Mostar attack}}</ref>

The Croats took over the west side of the city and expelled thousands<ref name="ICTY: Prli<U+0107> ''et al.'' (IT-04-74)"/> Bosniaks from the west side into the east side of the city. The HVO shelling reduced much of the east side of Mostar to rubble. The JNA (Yugoslav Army) demolished Carinski Bridge, Titov Bridge and Lucki Bridge over the river excluding the [[Stari Most]]. HVO forces (and its smaller divisions) engaged in a mass execution, ethnic cleansing and rape on the Bosniak people of the West Mostar and its surrounds and a fierce siege and shelling campaign on the Bosnian Government run East Mostar.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}} HVO campaign resulted in thousands of injured and killed.<ref name="ICTY: Prli<U+0107> ''et al.'' (IT-04-74)"/>

In April 1993 and early summer 1993, the ARBiH 3rd Corps units launched a series of attacks against the HVO. On 16 April, in the village of [[Trusina (Konjic)|Trusina]], members of the ARBiH unit called the ''Zulfikar'' killed 18 Croat civilians and 4 Croat soldiers.<ref>{{cite news|title=Memic et al: Witnessing the Shooting of Captives|url=http://www.bim.ba/en/265/10/32163/|newspaper=Balkan Investigative Reporting Network|date=11 April 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Bosnian woman pleads guilty to war crimes|url=http://www.montrealgazette.com/news/Bosnian+woman+pleads+guilty+crimes/6533343/story.html| newspaper=The Montreal Gazette|date=28 April 2012}}</ref> According to witness testimony, the unit rounded up a group of Croat civilians and captured soldiers. They then bound and shot them. A member of the ''Zulfikar'' unit, Rasema Handanovi<U+0107>, admitted taking part in the murders under orders from commander Nihad Bojad<U+017E>i<U+0107> who ordered the killing of the prisoners and was quoted as saying <U+201C>not to leave any survivors<U+201D>.<ref>{{cite news|title=Witness Admits to Trusina Killings|url=http://www.balkaninsight.com/en/article/witness-says-defendant-ordered-trusina-killings| newspaper=Balkan insight|date=2 April 2012}}</ref>

===The June 1993 Offensives===
In June 1993 further fighting broke out in Central Bosnia, some of it caused by the newly revitalised Bosnian Army.<ref>Kordic and Cerkez verdict -  IV. ATTACKS ON TOWNS AND VILLAGES: KILLINGS - D. The June and October Offensives - [http://www.un.org/icty/kordic/trialc/judgement/kor-tj010226e-5.htm#IVD]</ref>  Further complications were caused with the incident between Croats and [[UNPROFOR]] known as ''The Convoy of Joy Incident''. This convoy of [[aid]] supplies was made up of several hundred [[truck]]s, was seven kilometres in length and was bound for [[Tuzla]]. On June 7, 1993, two members of the delegation wrote to the European Community Monitor Mission ([[ECMM]]) at [[Zenica]] about their fears for the safety of the convoy when it reached the area of [[Travnik]] and Vitez in the light of threats made to it by [[Mate Boban]] (whom the delegation had met). As a result the ECMM decided to monitor the convoy. The convoy then made its way to Central Bosnia and the area of Novi Travnik. There it was stopped at a [[roadblock]] formed by a large [[crowd]] of Croat [[women]] at Rankovi<U+0107>i, north of Novi Travnik. Eight of the drivers were shot and killed, [[vehicle]]s were driven away and the convoy was looted by civilians and soldiers. Eventually the convoy was released. In defending the convoy Britbat shot and killed two HVO soldiers. The ICTY Trial Chamber concluded that the crowds which stopped the Convoy of Joy were under the control of Dario Kordi<U+0107> and colonel Bla<U+0161>ki<U+0107>.<ref name="ReferenceA">Kordic and Cerkez verdict -  IV.

Bosnian Army attacked the HVO in the Travnik municipality in the first week of June. By June 13, the Bosnian Army had taken Travnik and the surrounding villages.<ref>[[#Kordi<U+0107> and <U+010C>erkez judgement|Kordi<U+0107> and <U+010C>erkez judgement]], p. 245</ref> Several witnesses testified that 20,000 Croat refugees had come from Travnik as a result of the Bosnian Army offensive.<ref name="ReferenceA"/> However, according to an ECMM Report the first reports of ethnic cleansing and destruction were exaggerated. On June 8, there was fighting in Gu<U+010D>a Gora with reports of atrocities and destruction, the Catholic [[Church (building)|church]] in flames and thousands fleeing. These reports were investigated by two ECMM monitors. They found the church still standing and the claims of destruction to be exaggerated. The movement of population was organised by the HVO. According to report dated June 9, 1993 it is the first time that the Bosnian Army have taken the military initiative against the HVO in Central Bosnia. On all other occasions the Bosnian Army have responded to HVO [[aggression]] (Gornji Vakuf, Vitez and Mostar).<ref name="ReferenceB">[[#Kordi<U+0107> and <U+010C>erkez judgement|Kordi<U+0107> and <U+010C>erkez judgement]], p. 246</ref>

On June 9, 1993 HVO retaliated in Novi Travnik.<ref name="ReferenceB"/> On June 12<U+2013>13, 1993 the HVO attacked villages in the Kiseljak municipality, beginning with Tulica on June 12 resulting in the deaths of at least twelve men and women and the destruction of the village. The attack began with heavy shelling of the village followed by an infantry attack from several directions. The surviving men were loaded onto a truck and taken to Kiseljak barracks. Shortly after the attack on Tulica, the associated villages of Han Plo<U+010D>a and Grahovci were also subject to attack. The HVO issued an [[ultimatum]] to the Bosniaks to surrender their [[weapon]]s. After the ultimatum expired, the village was shelled by the HVO and the Serb Army, and houses were set on fire. An HVO [[infantry]] attack followed. Having come into the village, HVO soldiers lined up three Bosniak men against a wall and shot them. In all 64 people were killed during the attack or after HVO capture. The ICTY Trial Chamber found that the attacks on Tulica and Han Ploca<U+2013>Grahovci were part of a sustained HVO attack in which civilians were murdered and subjected to inhumane treatment.<ref>[[#Kordi<U+0107> and <U+010C>erkez judgement|Kordi<U+0107> and <U+010C>erkez judgement]], p. 248</ref>

The series of attacks culminated in a massive attack between 7 June and 13 June 1993 within, among others, the municipalities of Kakanj, Travnik and Zenica.<ref>{{cite news | newspaper = The New York Times | date = 30 June 1993 | author = Chuck Sudetich | title = 10 Leaders in Bosnia Try To Heal Rift Over Talks. | url = http://www.nytimes.com/1993/06/30/world/10-leaders-in-bosnia-try-to-heal-rift-over-talks.html?pagewanted=2&src=pm | accessdate = 2012-04-23}}</ref> The ABiH 3rd Corps attacked towns and villages, subjecting predominantly Bosnian Croat, but also Bosnian Serb civilians, including women, children, the elderly and the infirm, to willful killings and serious injuries.<ref name="ehak"/> Further, in the course of, or after the attacks, at least 200 Bosnian Croat and Bosnian Serb civilians were killed and many more were wounded or harmed while attempting to hide or escape.<ref name="ehak"/> In a music school turned detention centre, 47 Bosnian Croats were held without food for the first week and in a cellar with no light for 45 days, and were beaten with telephone cables, batons and shovel handles during interrogations.<ref name="UNHCHR"/> In several instances, ABiH forces killed HVO troops after their surrender.<ref name="ehak"/>

===Mujahideen===
In 1993, the Mujahideen were accused of massacres and war crimes against the Croat population in central Bosnia, including the villages of [[Miletici]] (April 24), [[Maljine]] (June 8), [[Doljani, Jablanica|Doljani]] (27<U+2013>28 June), [[Bistrica (Gornji Vakuf)|Bistrica]] (August), [[Kri<U+017E>|Kriz]] and [[Uzdol]] (14 September), and [[Kopijari]] (21 October), with an estimated number of at least 120 killed.<ref name="UNHCHR"/> In many cases, cruel mutilations were found on the corpses, said to be the work of the Mujahideen.<ref name="UNHCHR"/> On September 16, 1993 the Bosnian Army condemned of the killings carried out in Kriz and Uzdol and promised to persecute those responsible.<ref name="UNHCHR"/> On October 15, 1993, the [[United Nations Special Rapporteur]] wrote to Izetbegovi<U+0107>, lauding the effort and requested that the other killings be also investigated.<ref name="UNHCHR"/> He also requested to know what procedures existed to subordinate irregular troops to the Bosnian Army's command structure and what actions were used to enforce discipline.<ref name="UNHCHR"/> On October 22, 1993, Izetbegovi<U+0107> responded and in his letter condemned the killings and assured that an investigation had begun.<ref name="UNHCHR"/> In 2007, Bosnia's government revoked the citizenships of hundreds of former Mujadideen.<ref>[http://www.balkanpeace.org/index.php?index=article&articleid=14300 Bosnia Revokes Citizenship Of 100s of Its Jihadists]</ref>

===Neretva 93===
[[Bosnian Army]] launched an operation known as ''[[Operation Neretva '93]]'' against the [[Croatian Defence Council]] and [[Croatian Army]] in September 1993 in order to end the siege of [[Mostar]] and to recapture areas of Herzegovina, which were included in self-proclaimed [[Croatian Republic of Herzeg-Bosnia]]. The operation was stopped by Bosnian authorities after it received the information about the massacre on Croat civilians in the village of [[Grabovica (Tomislavgrad)|Grabovica]] (see also [[Massacre in Grabovica]]).{{cn|date=February 2013}}

==Aftermath==
The Croat-Bosniak war officially ended on February 23, 1994 when the Commander of HVO, general Ante Roso and commander of Bosnian Army, general Rasim Deli<U+0107>, signed a ceasefire agreement in [[Zagreb]].{{clarify|reason=Does the ceasefire make an official end to a war or a suspension of hostilities? Wouldn't the Washington Agreement make the end of the war official (formal)?|date=February 2013}} In March 1994 a peace agreement mediated by the [[USA]] between the warring Croats (represented by [[Republic of Croatia]]) and [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] was signed in Washington and Vienna. It is known as the [[Washington Agreement]]. Under this agreement, the combined territory held by the Croat and Bosnian government forces was divided into ten autonomous cantons, establishing the [[Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina]]. At the start of the war, the HVO had controlled more than 20 percent of the territory of Bosnia and Herzegovina; just before the signing of the Washington agreement, however, it was less than 10 percent.<ref name=magas>[[#Maga<U+0161> 2001|Maga<U+0161> (2001)]], p. 66</ref>

Several of the Croat leadership ([[Jadranko Prli<U+0107>]], [[Bruno Stoji<U+0107>]], [[Slobodan Praljak]], [[Milivoj Petkovi<U+0107>]], [[Valentin <U+0106>ori<U+0107>]] and [[Berislav Pu<U+0161>i<U+0107>]]) are presently on trial at the [[ICTY]] on charges including [[crimes against humanity]], grave breaches of the Geneva conventions and violations of the laws and customs of war. [[Dario Kordi<U+0107>]], political leader of Croats in Central Bosnia was convicted of the [[crimes against humanity]] in Central Bosnia i.e. [[ethnic cleansing]] and sentenced to 25 years in prison.<ref name="ICTY: Kordi<U+0107> and <U+010C>erkez verdict"/>

ABiH Brigadier General [[Enver Hadzihasanovic]] along with former brigade Chief of Staff and commander Amir Kubura was convicted for failing to take necessary and reasonable measures to prevent or punish several crimes committed by forces under their command in central Bosnia and Herzegovina in 1993 and the beginning of 1994. General Hadzihasanovic was sentenced to three years and six months of imprisonment on 22 April 2008 by the Appeals Chamber. Kubura was sentenced to two and a half years in prison.
