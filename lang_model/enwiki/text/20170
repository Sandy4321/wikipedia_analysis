'''James "Jim" McCartney''' (7 July 1902 &ndash; 18 March 1976) and '''Mary Patricia McCartney''' (n<U+00E9>e Mohin) (29 September 1909 &ndash; 31 October 1956) were the parents of musician, author and artist [[Paul McCartney]] of [[The Beatles]] and [[Wings (band)|Wings]], and photographer and musician [[Mike McCartney]], who worked with [[The Scaffold]].

Like many families in Liverpool, the McCartney and Mohin families are of [[Irish people|Irish]] descent. Jim worked for most of his life in the [[cotton]] trade, as well as playing in [[ragtime]] and [[jazz]] bands in [[Liverpool]], while Mary was a trained [[nurse]] and [[midwife]].

The McCartney family lived in [[council house]]s during Mary's life, but Paul later bought his father a house called Rembrandt, in [[Heswall]], [[Cheshire]]. Jim encouraged his two sons to take up music by buying instruments for them to learn, as well as improving their status in life through education. Mary was Paul's inspiration for the song, "[[Let It Be (song)|Let It Be]]". After Mary's death, Jim married Angela Williams and adopted her daughter from a previous marriage, [[Ruth McCartney]].

Mary's father was born in Tullynamalrow, [[County Monaghan]], Ireland, in 1880, as Owen Mohan, but permanently changed his name to Mohin when he was at school to avoid confusion with many other pupils with the same surname. After moving to Liverpool, he worked as a [[Trolley (horse-drawn)|coalman]], and married Mary Theresa Danher from [[Toxteth|Toxteth Park]], at St. Charles Roman Catholic Church, on 24 April 1905.{{sfn|Miles|1997|p=4}}

Jim was born at 8 Fishguard Street, [[Everton, Liverpool]] and was the third eldest of seven children. The McCartney children were John (Jack), Edith, James (Jim), Ann, Millie, Jane (Jin) and Joe (who was named after a brother who died in infancy).{{sfn|Spitz|2005|p=69}} Joe and Florrie McCartney moved shortly after Jim's birth to 3 Solva Street in Everton, which was a run-down [[terraced house]] about three-quarters of a mile from the Liverpool city centre, where Jim attended the Steers Street Primary School off Everton Road.{{sfn|Spitz|2005|p=69}}{{sfn|Spitz|2005|p=70}} After leaving school at 14, Jim found work for six [[shillings]] a week as a cotton "sample boy", at A.

He worked ten-hour days, five days a week, although he received a bonus at Christmas that was almost double his annual [[salary]].{{sfn|Spitz|2005|p=71}}

When [[World War II]] started Jim was too old to be called up for active service, as well as having previously been disqualified on medical grounds after falling from a wall and smashing his left [[eardrum]] when 10-years-old.{{sfn|Miles|1997|p=74}} After the cotton exchange closed for the duration of the war, Jim worked as an inspector at [[Robert Napier (engineer)|Napier's]] engineering works, which made shell cases that were later filled with explosives.<ref>[http://www.amostcuriousmurder.com/napier.htm Robert Napier - The Father of Clyde Shipbuilding] amostcuriousmurder.com - Retrieved 6 October 2007</ref> He volunteered to be a fireman at night and often watched Liverpool burning from his rooftop observer's position. Between 1940 and 1942, Liverpool endured 68 air-raids, which killed or injured more than 4,500 of the population and destroyed more than 10,000 homes.{{sfn|Miles|1997|p=4}}<ref>[http://www.liverpoolmuseums.org.uk/maritime/exhibitions/blitz/blitz.asp Liverpool in the Second World War] bbc.co.uk - Retrieved 11 October 2007</ref><ref>[http://www.bbc.co.uk/liverpool/localhistory/my_memory/air_raid_01.shtml Air Raids in Liverpool] bbc.co.uk - Retrieved 11 October 2007</ref> After the war he worked as an inspector for Liverpool Corporation's Cleansing Department before returning to the cotton trade in 1946.{{sfn|Spitz|2005|p=76}} 

Jim avidly read the ''[[Liverpool Echo]]'' or ''Express,'' liked solving crosswords and instigated discussions about varied subjects. His attitude to life was based upon self-respect, perseverance, fairness and a strong work ethic.{{sfn|Spitz|2005|p=82}} His political views were far from [[Left-wing politics|left-wing]], as he insisted that there was nothing anyone could do about the situation the working classes were in at the time, and nothing would ever change.{{sfn|Miles|1997|p=12}}

62-year-old Jim was earning <U+00A3>10 a week in 1964, but Paul suggested that his father should retire, and bought "Rembrandt"; a detached mock-Tudor house in Baskervyle Road, Heswall, Cheshire, for <U+00A3>8,750.{{sfn|Miles|1997|p=210}}<ref>[http://magicalbeatletours.com/tour_wirral.htm#rembrandt Photo of Rembrandt] magicalbeatletours.com - Retrieved 22 October 2007</ref> He bought his father a horse called "Drake's Drum", and a couple of years later, the horse won the race immediately preceding the [[Grand National]].{{sfn|Harry|2000}}

Mary Patricia Mohan was born at 2 Third Avenue, Fazakerley, Liverpool. After two years Mary's father met and married his second wife, Rose, while on a trip to Monaghan, in Ireland.<ref>[http://www.monaghanlive.com/_general/MonaghanLive.com.asp Info about Monaghan, Ireland] monaghanlive.com - Retrieved 6 October 2007</ref> Rose arrived in Liverpool with two children from a previous marriage, but Mary, who had until then been looking after the Mohan family, realised that Rose did not care much for domesticity or her new husband's children. After a year she chose to live with her aunts.{{sfn|Spitz|2005|p=74}} In 1923, at 14-years-old, Mary started work as a nurse trainee at the [[Smithdown Road, Liverpool|Smithdown Road Hospital]], and then took a three-year training course at Walton Road Hospital in Rice Lane, Liverpool; eventually becoming a state registered nurse.{{sfn|Spitz|2005|p=73}}

Mary became a domiciliary health visitor and midwife, and was on-call day or night, riding a bicycle to houses where she was needed as a midwife.{{sfn|Miles|1997|p=6}} Her eldest son, Paul, said his first memory was watching her cycling away when it was snowing heavily.{{sfn|Miles|1997|p=6}} After she had been diagnosed with [[cancer]], Mary (who was a heavy smoker) still carried on cycling to work, but often doubled up in pain and had trouble breathing.{{sfn|Spitz|2005|pp=88-89}}{{sfn|Lennon|2005|p=46}} The day Mary was due to have a [[mastectomy]] operation, she cleaned the McCartney house and laid her two sons' school clothes out; ready for the next day.

== Marriage ==
<!-- Put references into this article from books or web pages or your edit will be deleted -->
Mary met her future husband during an air raid on Liverpool in 1940, when Jim was 38 years old, and had settled into what his friends thought was, "a confirmed bachelorhood." Mary had been too career-conscious to think of marriage and, at 31-years-old, was thought of as a [[spinster]].{{sfn|Spitz|2005|p=73}} They met in June 1940, at 11 Scargreen Avenue, [[West Derby]], the McCartney family home. Mary was staying with Jim's sister, Jin, because of the lack of accommodation in Liverpool at the time.{{sfn|Spitz|2005|p=72}} As Mary sat quietly in an armchair, the air-raid sirens sounded at 9:30. At that time, the group moved to the Anderson shelter in the back garden to wait for the all-clear, but as there was an intensive bombing raid, the signal did not come and everyone was thus forced to sit in the cellar until dawn. Mary talked long enough with Jim to become romantically interested in him, and thought that he was "utterly charming and uncomplicated," as well as being entertained by his "considerable good humour."{{sfn|Spitz|2005|p=73}} They took out a marriage licence at Liverpool Town Hall on 8 April 1941, and were married a week later at St. Swithin's Roman Catholic chapel in Gillmoss, West Derby, on 15 April 1941.{{sfn|Spitz|2005|p=75}} They first lived at 10 Sunbury Road, Liverpool, and then resided for a short time at 92 Broadway, [[Wallasey]], during November 1942. Jim's job at Napiers was classified as war work, so the McCartneys were given a small, but temporary, [[Prefabricated home|prefab]] house at 3 Roach Avenue, [[Metropolitan Borough of Knowsley|Knowsley]].{{sfn|Miles|1997|p=5}} 

Mary's job enabled the McCartneys to move to a ground-floor flat at 75 Sir Thomas White Gardens, off St. Domingo Road in Everton, to live in a rent-free flat that was supplied by her employers.{{sfn|Spitz|2005|p=76}}{{sfn|Miles|1997|p=5}} They moved shortly after, in February 1946, to 72 Western Avenue in [[Speke]].{{sfn|Spitz|2005|p=78}}<ref>[http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?f=q&hl=en&geocode=&q=72+Western+Avenue+Speke,+Liverpool&sll=53.,-2.&sspn=0.,0.&ie=UTF8&ll=53.,-2.&spn=0.,0.&t=h&z=18&iwloc=addr&om=1 72 Western Avenue in Speke, Liverpool.] google.co.uk/maps - Retrieved 4 October 2007</ref> In 1948, the family moved again to 12 Ardwick Road (also in Speke) which was part of a new [[council estate|estate]] in the suburbs of Liverpool.{{sfn|Miles|1997|p=9}}<ref>[http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?f=q&hl=en&geocode=&q=12+Ardwick+Road+Speke,+Liverpool&sll=53.,-2.&sspn=0.,0.&ie=UTF8&t=h&z=16&iwloc=addr&om=1 12 Ardwick Road in Speke, Liverpool.] google.co.uk/maps - Retrieved 4 October 2007</ref> The frequent moves to better areas were Mary's idea, as she wanted to raise her children in the best neighbourhood possible.{{sfn|Miles|1997|p=15}}

[[File:20 forthlin road.jpg|thumb|right|[[20 Forthlin Road]] is now owned by The National Trust.]]
In 1955, the McCartney family moved for the last time to a small three-bedroomed brick-built terrace house at [[20 Forthlin Road]] in [[Allerton, Merseyside|Allerton]], which is now owned by [[National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty|The National Trust]].<ref>[http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?f=q&hl=en&geocode=&q=20+Forthlin+Road,+Liverpool&sll=53.34227,-2.&sspn=0.,0.&ie=UTF8&t=h&z=16&iwloc=addr&om=1 20 Forthlin Road in Allerton, Liverpool] google.co.uk/maps - Retrieved 4 October 2007</ref><ref>[http://books.google.com/books?id=htl2U1fPq8QC&pg=PA326&lpg=PA326&dq=rembrandt+mccartney&source=web&ots=Wm_6NQl0wz&sig=6nc0oRgcn8PxOVqoY7lXFoRJa70#PPA326,M1 The Rough Guide to the Beatles] google.com/books - Retrieved 22 October 2007</ref> It only cost [[Pounds sterling|<U+00A3>]]1/6s per week, which was due to Mary's seniority at the hospital.{{sfn|Spitz|2005|p=88}} Before moving to Forthlin Road, Jim had been secretary of the Speke [[Horticultural Society]], and had often sent his sons out to canvass for new members. Jim planted [[dahlias]] and [[snapdragons]] in the front garden of Forthlin Road and regularly trimmed the [[lavender]] hedge, although it was Paul's job to collect horse [[manure]] from the local streets in a bucket to be dug into the flowerbeds.{{sfn|Miles|1997|p=8}} As both Jim and Mary were heavy [[smoking|smokers]], Jim would first dry and then crush sprigs of Lavender and then burn them (like [[incense]]) in the ashtrays to kill the smell of cigarette smoke.{{sfn|Miles|1997|p=8}}

Money was a problem in the McCartney house, as Jim only earned up to <U+00A3>6.00 a week, which was less than his wife.{{sfn|Miles|1997|p=5}} Because of their financial situation, the McCartney family could not afford to buy a [[television]] set until the [[coronation of Queen Elizabeth II]] in 1953, and never owned a car.{{sfn|Miles|1997|p=6}} His two sons were the first in the McCartney family line to buy cars.<ref>[http://www.liverpoolmuseums.org.uk/mol/exhibitions/mccartney/home.asp Michael McCartney's first car] liverpoolmuseums.org.uk - Retrieved 7 October 2007</ref> When The Beatles became successful, Jim had to leave Forthlin Road because fans used to stand outside and stare through the windows, which made him feel uncomfortable and nervous. Eight years after Mary's death, Jim married Angela Williams, on 24 November 1964.{{sfn|Harry|2000}} Williams had a daughter from a previous marriage, Ruth, whom Jim legally adopted.{{sfn|Miles|1997|p=557}}

As Mary was a Roman Catholic and Jim a Church of England [[Protestant]]<U+2014>who later turned [[agnostic]]<U+2014>their children were baptised [[Roman Catholic]] but raised [[non-denominational]]ly, although Mary had married Jim on the promise that any children would be baptised in the Catholic faith. Although registered on his birth certificate as James Paul McCartney, their first son was known as Paul thereafter.{{sfn|Spitz|2005|p=76}} The two boys were not enrolled in Catholic schools, as their father believed that they leaned too much towards religion instead of education.{{sfn|Miles|1997|p=4}} Paul remembers his mother encouraging her children to use the [[Queen's English]] and not the [[Liverpudlian]] dialect, which was unusual for the area they lived in.{{sfn|Spitz|2005|p=73}}{{sfn|Miles|1997|p=15}} Michael remembered that Jim had a temper when he was provoked, and that both Paul and he were hit when they were young, but this is refuted by other members of the family.{{sfn|Spitz|2005|p=80}}

Jim and Mary would often take Paul and Michael for a walk to the local rustic village of Hale (home of the giant Childe of [[Hale, Halton|Hale]]'s gravesite).{{sfn|Miles|1997|p=10}} According to Paul, these frequent trips out of Liverpool to the countryside inspired his love of nature.{{sfn|Miles|1997|p=29}} The McCartneys had a full set of [[George Newnes]] encyclopedias which Jim encouraged Paul and Michael to use, and told his sons to look up any word they did not understand.{{sfn|Miles|1997|pp=12-13}} After Paul had passed the [[Eleven plus exam|Eleven-plus Exam]]<U+2014>meaning he would automatically gain a place at the [[Liverpool Institute]]<U+2014>it was hoped that Paul would become a doctor or a teacher. Michael would also attend the Liverpool Institute two years later.{{sfn|Miles|1997|p=12}} 
After Mary's death, Paul and Michael were sent to live with Jim's brother Joe, and his wife Joan, for a short time, so as to let their father grieve in private.{{sfn|Miles|1997|p=20}} Jim depended heavily on his sisters, Jin and Millie, to help around the house, as he was so depressed he once threatened suicide.{{sfn|Spitz|2005|p=91}} Jim later took part in the running of the household, as [[Cynthia Lennon]] remembered that when she and [[John Lennon]] used to visit Forthlin Road, Jim would often answer the door with his sleeves rolled up, a [[tea towel]] in his hand and an [[apron]] tied around his waist.{{sfn|Lennon|2005|p=47}} When Paul later played at [[The Cavern]] during lunchtimes, Jim would drop off food there that Paul would later put in the oven at Forthlin Road.{{sfn|Lennon|2005|p=87}} Ruth remembered that Jim was funny and musical with her, but also strict when she was young, and was insistent that she learned good [[table manners]] and [[etiquette]] when speaking to people.<ref>[http://www.classicbands.com/RuthMcCartneyInterview.html Interview with Ruth McCartney] classicbands.com - Retrieved 11 October 2007</ref>

After first meeting Lennon, Jim warned Paul that he would get him "into trouble", although he later allowed [[The Quarrymen]] to rehearse in the dining room at Forthlin Road in the evenings.{{sfn|Miles|1997|pp=32-38}} Jim was reluctant to let the teenage Paul go to [[Hamburg]] with The Beatles until Paul said the group would earn <U+00A3>15 per week each.{{sfn|Lennon|2005|pp=69-70}} As this was more than he earned himself, Jim finally agreed, but only after a visit from the group's then-manager, [[Allan Williams]], who said that Jim should not worry.{{sfn|Miles|1997|p=57}}{{sfn|Spitz|2005|p=205}} Jim was later present at a Beatles' concert in [[Manchester]] when fans surrounded drummer [[Pete Best]], and ignored the rest of The Beatles. Jim criticised Best by saying, "Why did you have to attract all the attention? Why didn't you call the other lads back? I think that was very selfish of you".{{sfn|Spitz|2005|p=322}} [[Bill Harry]] recalled that Jim was probably "The Beatles' biggest fan", and was extremely proud of Paul's success. Shelagh Johnson<U+2014>later to become director of The Beatles' Museum in Liverpool<U+2014>said that Jim's outward show of pride embarrassed his son.{{sfn|Spitz|2005|p=392}} Jim enlisted Michael's help when sorting through the ever-increasing sacks of fan letters that were delivered to Forthlin Road, with both composing "personal" responses that were supposedly from Paul.{{sfn|Spitz|2005|p=410}} Michael would later have success on his own with the group The Scaffold.<ref>[http://biguntidy.com/Articles/Scaffold.pdf The Scaffold biog] biguntidy.com - Retrieved 8 October 2007</ref>

Paul wrote "[[I Lost My Little Girl]]" just after Mary had died, and explained that it was a subconscious reference to his late mother.<ref name="MilesPage21">Miles (1997) p. 21</ref> He also wrote "[[Golden Slumbers (The Beatles song)|Golden Slumbers]]" at his father's house in Heswall, and said the lyrics were taken from Ruth McCartney's sheet-music copy of [[Thomas Dekker (poet)|Thomas Dekker]]'s lullaby<U+2014>also called "[[Golden Slumbers]]"<U+2014>that Ruth had left on the piano at Rembrandt.{{sfn|Miles|1997|p=210}}{{sfn|Miles|1997|p=557}}<ref name="TheBeatlesAnthologyDVD">"The Beatles Anthology" DVD 2003 (Special Features<U+2014>Back at Abbey Road May 1995<U+2014> 0:00:16) McCartney talking about the writing of "Golden Slumbers".</ref> [[Hunter Davies]], who was at Jim's house at the time doing an interview for his Beatles' biography, remembered Jim listening to an [[acetate disc]] of "When I'm Sixty-Four".{{sfn|Miles|1997|p=319}} Davies wrote that Paul recorded the song specifically for his father, as Jim was then 64 years old and had married Angela two years previously.<ref>[http://www.guardian.co.uk/g2/story/0,3604,,00.html 'When I'm 64' story] guardian.co.uk - Retrieved 11 October 2007</ref> Paul wrote "Let It Be", because of a dream he had during the ''[[Let It Be (album)|Get Back/Let It Be]]'' sessions. He said that he had dreamt of his mother, and the "Mother Mary" lyric was about her.<ref name="h2g2McCartneybiog"/> He later said, "It was great to visit with her again. I felt very blessed to have that dream. So that got me writing 'Let It Be'."{{sfn|Harry|2000}}{{sfn|Miles|1997|p=20}}

In 1974, Paul added lyrics and recorded a song his father had previously written, entitled "Walking in the Park with Eloise", which was released by Wings under the pseudonym, "The Country Hams". The Country Hams' single was backed with a tune entitled "Bridge on the River Suite". Both songs can be found on the CD ''[[Wings at the Speed of Sound]]'' from [[The Paul McCartney Collection]].
