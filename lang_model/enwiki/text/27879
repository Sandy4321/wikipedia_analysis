==Taxonomy and naming==
The species was first described by French naturalist [[Ren<U+00E9> Primev<U+00E8>re Lesson]] in 1828, but an earlier description was given by [[Karl Rudolphi]] in 1822 (although he assumed it was a Minke Whale (''Balaenoptera acutorostrala'')) therefore the species is occasionally referred to as '''Rudolphi's Rorqual'''.<ref name=allen>{{cite book| url=http://books.google.com/books?id=30YZAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA234&dq=Balaenoptera+borealis&as_brr=1 | title=Whalebone Whales of New England | author = Glover Morrill Allen | year = 1916 | pages = 234 | volume = 8 | accessdate=2009-06-24 }}</ref>  Additional names include '''Pollack Whale''', '''Coalfish Whale''', '''Sardine Whale''', or '''Japan Finner'''.<ref name="whalesonnet">{{cite web | url=http://www.whales.org.au/discover/sei/seig.html | title=Sei Whales (''Balaenoptera borealis'') | publisher = Whales on the net | accessdate=2006-11-29 }}</ref>  Additionally, it has been referred to as the '''Lesser Fin Whale''' because it somewhat resembles the Fin whale.<ref name=allen/> 

The whale has also been previously classified as ''Balaena rostraia'', ''Balaena borealis'', ''Bataenoptera laticeps'', and ''Eulama physalus'' among others before Lesson's classification of ''Balaenoptera borealis'' was formalized.<ref name=allen/> 

''Sei'' is the Norwegian word for [[pollock]], also referred to as coalfish, a close relative of codfish.  Sei Whales appeared off the coast of [[Norway]] at the same time as the pollock, both coming to feed on the abundant [[plankton]].<ref name="acs"/>  The specific name is the Latin word ''borealis'', meaning northern.  In the Pacific, the whale has been called the Japan Finner; "finner" was a common term used to refer to rorquals.  In Japanese the whale was called ''iwashi kujira'', or Sardine Whale, named for a fish that the whale has been observed to eat in the Pacific.<ref name="natlgeo1911">{{cite journal | url = http://web.archive.org/web/www.edwardtbabinski.us/whales/shore_whaling_industry.html | journal = National Geographic Magazine | month = May | year = 1911 | title = Shore Whaling: A World Industry | author = Andrews, R.C. }}</ref>

Sei Whales are [[rorqual]]s (family Balaenopteridae), a family of the baleen whales that includes the [[Humpback Whale]], the [[Blue Whale]], [[Bryde's Whale]], the [[Fin Whale]], and the [[Minke Whale]].  Rorquals take their name from the [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]] word ''r<U+00F8>yrkval'', meaning "furrow whale",<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iberianature.com/trivia/etymology_mammals.htm | title = Etymology of mammal names | publisher = IberiaNature <U+2013> Natural history facts and trivia | accessdate = 2006-12-07}}</ref> because members of the family have a series of longitudinal pleats or grooves located below the mouth and continuing along the underside of the body.  The family Balaenopteridae is believed to have diverged from the other families of the suborder [[baleen whale|Mysticeti]], also called the Whalebone Whales or Great Whales, as long ago as the middle [[Miocene]].<ref name="evolution">{{cite book | url = http://www-personal.umich.edu/~gingeric/PDFfiles/PDG413_Whaleevol.pdf | format = PDF | title = McGraw-Hill Yearbook of Science & Technology | year = 2004 | publisher = The McGraw Hill Companies | chapter = Whale Evolution | author = Gingerich, P.}}</ref>  However, little is known about when members of the various families in the Mysticeti, including the Balaenopteridae, diverged from each other.

Two [[subspecies]] have been identified&mdash;the '''Northern Sei Whale''' (''Balaenoptera borealis borealis'') and '''Southern Sei Whale''' (''Balaenoptera borealis schleglii'').<ref name="ITIS">{{ITIS | ID = 180526 | taxon = Balaenoptera borealis | year = 2006 | date = 10 November}}</ref>  The two subspecies are geographically isolated from each other and their ranges do not overlap.

==Description and behaviour==

The Sei Whale is the third largest member of the Balaenopteridae family, after the [[Blue Whale]] (up to 180 tonnes, 200 tons) and the [[Fin Whale]] (up to 70 tonnes, 77 tons).<ref name="mfr"/>  Mature adults typically measure between 12 and 15&nbsp;metres (40&ndash;50&nbsp;ft)<ref name="adw"/> and weigh 20&ndash;30&nbsp;tonnes (22&ndash;33&nbsp;tons).  The Southern Sei Whale is larger than the Northern Sei Whale, and females are considerably larger than males.<ref name="nmfs"/>   The largest known Sei Whale measured 20&nbsp;metres (66&nbsp;ft),<ref name="adw"/> and weighed between 40 and 45&nbsp;tonnes (44&ndash;50&nbsp;tons).  The largest specimens taken off [[Iceland]] were slightly longer than 16&nbsp;metres (52&nbsp;ft).<ref name="martin83">{{cite journal | author = Martin, A.R. | year = 1983 | title = The sei whale off western Iceland.

The whale's body is typically a dark steel grey with irregular light grey to white markings on the [[Anatomical terms of location#dorsal and ventral|ventral]] surface, or towards the front of the lower body.  The whale has a series of 32&ndash;60 [[pleat]]s or grooves along the bottom of the body that allow the throat area to expand greatly during feeding.   The snout is pointed and the [[Fish anatomy#types of fin|pectoral fins]] are relatively short compared to other whales, with a length of only 9%&ndash;10% of the total body length, and pointed at the tips.<ref name="acs"/>  It has a single ridge extending from the tip of the snout to the paired [[Blowhole (biology)|blowholes]] that are a distinctive characteristic of baleen whales. 

The whale's skin is often marked by pits or wounds, which after healing become white scars.  These are believed to be caused by [[Parasitism|ectoparasitic]] [[copepod]]s (''Penella'' spp.),<ref name="ivashin">{{cite journal | author = Ivashin, M.V. | coauthors = Yu.P.

[[Image:Baleen.jpg|thumb|left|250px|A close-up view of baleen plates. The plates are used to strain food from the water]]

This rorqual is a [[filter feeder]], using its [[baleen|baleen plate]]s to obtain its food from the water by opening its mouth, engulfing large amounts of the water containing the food, then straining the water out through the [[baleen]], trapping any food items inside its mouth.  An adult has 300&ndash;380 ashy-black baleen plates on each side of the mouth, each about 48&nbsp;centimetres (19&nbsp;in) long.   Each plate is made of [[nail (anatomy)|fingernail]]-like [[keratin]] that frays out into whitish fine hairs on the ends inside the mouth near the [[tongue]].<ref name="adw"/>  The very fine bristles of the Sei Whale's baleen (about 0.1&nbsp;mm, 0.004&nbsp;in) are cited as the most reliable feature distinguishing it from all other baleen whales.<ref name="mead">{{cite journal | author = Mead, J.G. | year = 1977 | title = Records of sei and Bryde's whales from the Atlantic coast of the United States, the Gulf of Mexico, and the Caribbean | journal = Rep. Int. Whal. Commn | volume = Spec. Iss. 1 | pages = 113<U+2013>116}}</ref>

The Sei Whale looks similar to other large baleen whales.  The best way to distinguish between it and the [[Bryde's Whale]], apart from differences in each whale's baleen, is by the presence of lateral ridges on the dorsal surface of the Bryde's Whale's head.   Large Sei Whales can be confused with [[Fin Whale]]s unless the Fin Whale's asymmetrical head colouration is clearly seen; the right side of the lower jaw of the Fin Whale is white, and the left side is grey.  When viewed from the side, the upper edge of the Sei Whale's head has a small arch between the tip of the snout and the eye, whereas the Fin Whale's profile is relatively flat.<ref name="nmfs"/>

Sei Whales usually travel alone<ref name="edds84">{{cite journal | author = Edds, P.L. | coauthors = T.J. MacIntyre, and R. Naveen | year = 1984 | title = Notes on a sei whale (''Balaenoptera borealis'' Lesson) sighted off Maryland | journal = Cetus | volume = 5 | number = 2 | pages = 4<U+2013>5 }}</ref> or in small groups of up to six individuals.<ref name="schilling"/>  Larger groups have been seen at particularly abundant feeding grounds.  Very little is known about their [[social structure]].  Males and females may form a bond, but there is insufficient research to know this for certain.<ref name="mfr"/><ref name="imms">{{cite web | url = http://www.dolphinsrus.com/factsheets/sei.pdf | format = PDF | title = The Sei Whale (''Balaenoptera borealis'') | publisher = The Institute for Marine Mammal Studies | accessdate = 2006-12-07 }}</ref>

The Sei Whale is among the fastest of all [[cetacea]]ns.  It can reach speeds of up to 50&nbsp;kilometres per hour (31&nbsp;mph, 27&nbsp;[[Knot (unit)|knots]]) over short distances.<ref name="adw"/>  However, it is not a remarkable diver, diving only to relatively shallow depths for between five to fifteen&nbsp;minutes.  Between these dives, the whale swims near the surface for a few minutes, remaining visible in clear, calm waters, with blows occurring at intervals of about 40&ndash;60&nbsp;seconds.    Unlike the Fin Whale, the Sei Whale tends not to rise high out of the water as it dives.  The [[Blowhole (biology)|blowholes]] and dorsal fin are often exposed above the water surface simultaneously.  The whale almost never extends its flukes above the surface, and it rarely [[Whale#behavior|breaches]], or leaps high out of the water.<ref name="nmfs"/>

=== Feeding ===
[[Image:Krill swarm.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Krill]], shrimp-like marine invertebrate animals, are one of the Sei Whale's primary foods.]]

The Sei Whale feeds near the surface of the ocean, swimming on its side through swarms of [[predation|prey]] to obtain its average of about 900&nbsp;kilograms (2,000&nbsp;lb) of food each day.<ref name="adw"/>  For an animal of its size, it is notable because for the most part, its preferred foods lie relatively low in the [[food chain]], including [[zooplankton]] and small fish. The whale's preference for zooplankton has been determined from stomach analyses and direct observations of feeding behaviour.<ref name="watkins">{{cite journal | author = Watkins, W.A.|coauthors = W.E.

In the [[Atlantic Ocean|North Atlantic]], the Sei Whale feeds primarily on [[Calanoida|calanoid copepods]], specifically ''Calanus finmarchicus'', with a secondary preference for [[krill|euphausiids (krill)]], in particular ''Meganyctiphanes norvegica'' and ''Thysanoessa inermis''.<ref name="mizroch84">{{cite journal | author = Mizroch, S.A. | coauthors = D.W.

The differences in gestation period are the result of not being able to observe a whale's entire pregnancy; most of the reproductive data for baleen whales were obtained from animals killed by commercial whalers, which offers only a single view of the foetus' growth.  Researchers then attempt to extrapolate conception dates based upon the measurements and physical characteristics of the foetuses and how they compare with newborn whales.  

A newborn [[weaning|wean]]s from its mother at 6&ndash;9 months of age when it is 11&ndash;12&nbsp;metres (36&ndash;39&nbsp;ft) in length,<ref name="lockyer and martin"/> so weaning takes place on the feeding grounds in summer or autumn.

=== Vocalizations ===
{{seealso|Whale song}}
Like other whales, the Sei Whale is known to make long, loud, low-frequency sounds.  Relatively little is known about the specific calls made by this whale, but in 2003, observers noted Sei Whale calls in addition to broadband sounds that could be described as "growls" or "whooshes" off the coast of the [[Antarctic Peninsula]].<ref name="mcdonald05">{{cite journal | author = McDonald, M. | coauthors=Hildebrand, J., Wiggins, S., Thiele, D., Glasgow, D., and Moore, S. | title = Sei whale sounds recorded in the Antarctic | journal = The Journal of the Acoustical Society of America | month = December | year = 2005 | volume = 118 | issue = 6 | pages = 3941<U+2013>3945 | url = http://scitation.aip.org/getabs/servlet/GetabsServlet?prog=normal&id=JASMAN000118000006003941000001&idtype=cvips&gifs=yes  | doi = 10.1121/1.2130944}}</ref>   Many of the calls consisted of multiple parts with a change in frequency between the parts.  This combination is viewed as a key feature that can be used to distinguish the Sei Whale's call from the calls of other whales.  Most calls lasted about a half second, and occurred in the 240&ndash;625&nbsp;[[hertz]] frequency, well within the normal range of sounds that most humans can hear.  The maximum source level of the vocal sequences is reported as 156 [[decibel]]s relative to 1&nbsp;[[Pascal (unit)|micropascal (<U+03BC>Pa)]] for a reference distance of one [[metre]].<ref name="mcdonald05"/> This is louder than a jet engine and a gun blast.

Sei Whales are found worldwide, although they are only rarely found in [[polar region|polar]] or [[tropics|tropical]] waters.<ref name="nmfs"/>  The difficulty of distinguishing Sei Whales at seas from their close relatives, [[Bryde's Whale]]s and in some cases from [[Fin Whale]]s, has created confusion about their distributional limits and frequency of occurrence, especially in warmer waters where Bryde's Whales are most common.

In the North Atlantic, the range of the Sei Whale extends from [[southern Europe]] or [[Northwest Africa|northwestern Africa]] to [[Norway]] in the eastern North Atlantic, and from the [[southern United States]] to [[Greenland]] in the western.<ref name="Gambell85a"/>  The southernmost confirmed records are strandings along the northern [[Gulf of Mexico]] and in the [[Greater Antilles]].<ref name="mead"/>  Throughout its range, the whale tends to avoid semi-enclosed bodies of water such as the Gulf of Mexico, the [[Gulf of Saint Lawrence]], [[Hudson Bay]], the [[North Sea]], and the [[Mediterranean Sea]].<ref name="nmfs"/>   It occurs predominantly in deep water, occurring most commonly over the [[continental shelf|continental slope]],<ref name="CETAP">{{cite paper | author = CETAP | year = 1982 | title = Final Report of the Cetacean and Turtle Assessment Program, University of Rhode Island, to Bureau of Land Management | publisher = U.S. Department of the Interior.

In the North Pacific, the Sei Whale is found from [[20th parallel north|20<U+00B0>N]]&ndash;[[23rd parallel north|23<U+00B0>N]] [[latitude]] in the winter, and from [[35th parallel north|35<U+00B0>N]]&ndash;[[50th parallel north|50<U+00B0>N]] latitude in the summer.<ref name="masaki76">{{cite journal | author = Masaki, Y. | year = 1976 | title = Biological studies on the North Pacific sei whale | journal = Bull.

In the [[Southern Hemisphere]], summer distribution based upon historic catch data is between 40<U+00B0>S&ndash;50<U+00B0>S latitude, while winter distribution is unknown.<ref name="mizroch84"/> 

In general, the Sei Whale migrates annually from cool and subpolar waters in summer to temperate and subtropical waters for winter, where food is more abundant.<ref name="nmfs"/>  In the northwest Atlantic, sightings and catch records suggest that the whale moves north along the shelf edge to arrive in the areas of [[Georges Bank]], [[Gulf of Maine|Northeast Channel]], and [[Gulf of Maine|Browns Bank]] by mid to late June.  They are present off the south coast of [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]] in August and September, and a southbound migration begins moving west and south along the [[Nova Scotia]]n shelf from mid-September to mid-November.  Whales in the [[Labrador Sea]] as early as the first week of June may move farther northward to waters southwest of [[Greenland]] later in the summer.<ref name="mitchell and chapman">{{cite journal | author = Mitchell, E. | coauthors = D.G.

Iss. 1 | pages = 117<U+2013>120 }}</ref>  In the northeast Atlantic, the Sei Whale winters as far south as [[West Africa]] and follows the continental slope northward in spring.  Large females lead the northward migration and reach the [[Denmark Strait]] earlier and more reliably than other sexes and classes, arriving in mid-July and remaining through mid-September.  In some years, males and younger females remain at lower latitudes during the summer months.<ref name="martin83"/> 

Despite knowing some general trends in the migration patterns of the Sei Whale, exact migration routes are not known<ref name="martin83"/> and scientists cannot readily predict exactly where groups will appear from one year to the next. A particular location may one year see an influx of many whales and none for several years afterwards.<ref name="jonsgard and darling">{{cite journal | author = Jonsg<U+00E5>rd, <U+00C5>. | coauthors = K.

==Whaling==
{{main|Whaling|History of whaling}}
[[Image:Whaling harpoon.jpg|thumb|left|200px|A whaling harpoon.]]

The development of explosive [[harpoon]]s and steam-powered catcher boats in the late nineteenth century allowed the exploitation of previously unobtainable large whales by commercial [[Whaling|whalers]].  Because of their quick speed and elusiveness,<ref name="sigurj<U+00F3>nsson88">{{cite journal | author = Sigurj<U+00F3>nsson, J.|year =  1988 |title= Operational factors of the Icelandic large whale fishery | journal = Rep. Int. Whal. Commn |volume = 38 |pages = 327<U+2013>333}}</ref> and later because of their comparatively small yield of [[Whale oil|oil]] and meat compared with other large whales, the Sei Whale was initially not methodically hunted. When stocks of the more commercially attractive [[right whale]]s, [[Blue Whale]]s, [[Fin Whale]]s, and [[Humpback Whale]]s became depleted, Sei Whales were hunted in earnest, particularly in the 1950s through the 1970s.<ref name="mfr"/>

===North Atlantic===
In the North Atlantic Ocean between 1885 and 1984, 14,295 Sei Whales were captured.<ref name="horwood87"/>  They were hunted in large numbers off the coast of [[Norway]] and [[Scotland]] beginning in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries,<ref name="jonsgard and darling"/> and in 1885 alone, more than 700 Sei Whales were killed off [[Finnmark|Finnmark, Norway]].<ref name="andrews16">{{cite journal | author = Andrews, R.C.| year= 1916 | title= The sei whale (''Balaenoptera borealis'' Lesson)| journal = Mem. Am. Mus. Nat. Hist.

In Iceland, a total of 2,574 whales were taken from the [[Hvalfj<U+00F6>r<U+00F0>ur]] whaling station between 1948 and 1985.  Since the late 1960s or early 1970s, the Sei Whale has been second only to the [[Fin Whale]] as a preferred target of Icelandic whalers, with the demand for high-quality meat taking precedence over that for [[whale oil]], which was once the main target of whalers.<ref name="sigurj<U+00F3>nsson88"/>  

Small numbers of Sei Whales were taken off the [[Iberian Peninsula]] beginning in the 1920s by Spanish whalers,<ref name="aguilar and lens">{{cite journal | author = Aguilar, A. | coauthors = and S. Lens | year = 1981 | title = Preliminary report on Spanish whaling operations | journal = Rep. Int. Whal.

===North Pacific===
In the North Pacific, the total reported kill of Sei Whales by commercial whalers was 72,215 between 1910 and 1975;<ref name="horwood87"/> the majority were taken after 1947.<ref name="barlow97">{{cite paper | author = Barlow, J., K.

In 1959, the Japanese catch peaked when 1,340 whales were taken. Heavy exploitation by [[pelagic zone|pelagic]] whalers in the North Pacific began in the early 1960s, with total catches averaging 3,643 per year from 1963 to 1974 (total 43,719; annual range 1,280&ndash;6,053).<ref name="tillman77">{{cite journal | author = Tillman, M.F.| year = 1977 | title =  Estimates of population size for the North Pacific sei whale | journal = Rep.

Off the coast of [[North America]], Sei Whales were hunted in waters off [[British Columbia]] from the late 1950s to the mid 1960s, when the number of whales captured dropped to around 14 per year.<ref name="mfr"/>  More than 2,000 were killed in British Columbia waters between 1962 and 1967.<ref name="pike69">{{cite journal | author = Pike, G.C| coauthors = and I.B. MacAskie | year = 1969| title = Marine mammals of British Columbia| journal = Fish. Res. Bd. Canada Bull. | volume = 171}}</ref> Between 1957 and 1971, [[California]] shore stations processed 386 whales.<ref name="rice77"/>  Commercial whaling for Sei Whales ended in the eastern North Pacific in 1971.

===Southern Hemisphere===
A total of 152,233 Sei Whales were taken in the [[Southern Hemisphere]] between 1910 and 1979.<ref name="horwood87"/>   Whaling in the [[Southern Ocean|southern oceans]] originally targeted [[Humpback Whale]]s.  By 1913, this target species became rare and the catch of [[Fin Whale|Fin]] and [[Blue Whale]]s began to increase.  As these species likewise became scarce, Sei Whale catches increased rapidly in the late 1950s and early 1960s.<ref name="mizroch84"/>  The catch peaked in 1964 at over 20,000 Sei Whales, but by 1976, this number had dropped to below 2,000 and commercial whaling for the species ended in 1977.<ref name="mfr"/>

===International protection===
[[Image:International Whaling Commission members.svg|330px|thumb|Member states of the International Whaling Commission (in blue).]]

The Sei Whale did not have meaningful protection at the international level until 1970, when catch quotas for the [[North Pacific]] began to be set on a species basis by the [[International Whaling Commission]] (IWC).  Prior to catch quotas, whalers were limited only by their ability to locate the whales.<ref name="allen80">{{cite book | author = Allen, K.R. | year = 1980 | title = Conservation and Management of Whales | publisher = Univ. of Washington Press | location = Seattle, WA }}</ref>  The Sei Whale was given complete protection from commercial whaling in the North Pacific in 1976, and quotas on Sei Whales were introduced in the North Atlantic in 1977.  Southern hemisphere stocks were protected from whaling in 1979.  Facing mounting evidence that several whale species worldwide were threatened with extinction, the IWC voted to implement a moratorium on commercial whaling beginning in 1986, at which time all legal whaling for Sei Whales stopped.<ref name="nmfs"/>  

In the late 1970s, some "pirate" whaling took place in the eastern North Atlantic.<ref name="best92">{{cite journal | author = Best, P.B. | year = 1992 | title = Catches of fin whales in the North Atlantic by the M.V. ''Sierra'' (and associated vessels) | journal = Rep. Int. Whal. Commn | volume = 42 | pages = 697<U+2013>700 }}</ref>  There is no direct evidence of illegal whaling in the North Pacific, although the acknowledged misreporting of whaling data by the [[Soviet Union]]<ref name="yablokov94">{{cite journal | author = Yablokov, A.V. | year = 1994 | title = Validity of whaling data | doi=10.1038/367108a0 | journal = Nature | volume = 367 | pages = 108 }}</ref> means that catch data are not entirely reliable. 

The species remained listed on the [[International Union for Conservation of Nature|IUCN]] [[IUCN Red List|Red List of Threatened Species]] in 2000, categorised as "endangered".<ref name="iucn"/>  Populations in the [[Northern Hemisphere]] are listed as [[CITES]] Appendix II, indicating that they are not necessarily threatened with extinction, but may become so if they are not listed.  Populations in the [[Southern Hemisphere]] are listed as [[CITES]] Appendix I, indicating that they are threatened with extinction if trade is not halted.<ref name="adw"/>

===Post-protection whaling===
Since the moratorium on commercial whaling, some Sei Whales have been taken by [[Iceland]]ic and [[Japan]]ese whalers under the IWC's scientific research programme.  Iceland carried out four years of scientific whaling between 1986 and 1989, catching up to 40 Sei Whales a year.<ref name="wwf-Iceland">{{cite press release | publisher = WWF-International | title = WWF condemns Iceland<U+2019>s announcement to resume whaling | date = [[2003-08-07]] | url = http://www.panda.org/about_wwf/where_we_work/arctic/news/index.cfm?uNewsID=8221 | accessdate = 2006-11-10 }}</ref>  

Japanese scientists kill approximately 50 Sei Whales each year for this purpose.  The research is conducted by the [[Institute of Cetacean Research]] (ICR) in [[Tokyo]], a privately funded, non-profit institution.  The main focus of the research is to examine what Sei Whales eat and to determine the level of competition between whales and fisheries.  Dr. Seiji Ohsumi, Director General of the ICR, said "It is estimated that whales consume 3 to 5 times the amount of marine resources as are caught for human consumption, so our whale research is providing valuable information required for improving the management of all our marine resources."<ref name="icr02a">{{cite press release | publisher = The Institute of Cetacean Research, Tokyo, Japan | title = Japan not catching endangered whales | date = [[2002-03-01]] | url = http://www.icrwhale.org/eng/SEI.pdf |format=PDF| accessdate = 2006-11-10}}</ref>  He later added that "...Sei Whales are the second most abundant species of whale in the western North Pacific, with an estimated population of over 28,000 animals.  [It is] clearly not endangered."<ref name="icr02b">{{cite press release | publisher = The Institute of Cetacean Research, Tokyo, Japan | title = Japan's senior whale scientist responds to New York Times advertisement | date = [[2002-05-20]] | accessdate = 2006-11-10 | url=http://www.icrwhale.org/eng/NYTimes.pdf |format=PDF}}</ref>  

Conservation groups such as the [[World Wide Fund for Nature|World Wildlife Fund]] dispute the necessity of the research, saying that it is known that Sei Whales feed primarily on [[squid]] and [[plankton]] not hunted by humans, and only rarely on [[fish]].  They say that the programme is "nothing more than a plan designed to keep the whaling fleet in business, and the need to use whales as the scapegoat for over-fishing by humans."<ref name="wwf05"/>  The scientific quality of the research obtained under the scientific whaling programme has been criticised as being very poor; at the 2001 meeting of the IWC Scientific Committee, 32 scientists submitted a document expressing their belief that the Japanese programme lacked scientific rigour and would not meet minimum standards of [[peer review|academic review]] that are widely used in science world-wide.<ref name="clapham02">{{cite journal | author = Clapham, P. et al. | year = 2002 | title = Relevance of JARPN II to management, and a note on scientific standards.

==Population estimates==
The current global population of the Sei Whale is estimated to be 54,000, about one fifth of the  population before the era of commercial [[whaling]].<ref name="acs"/>  A 1991 study in the North Atlantic produced a total population in that area of only 4,000.<ref name="braham92">{{cite paper | author = Braham, H. | year = 1992 | title = Endangered whales: Status update | publisher = Alaska Fisheries Science Center, Seattle, WA}}</ref> .<ref name="blaylock95">{{cite paper | author = Blaylock, R.A., J.W.
