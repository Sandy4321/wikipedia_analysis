'''Sarah Brightman''' (born [[August 14]], [[1960]]) is an [[English (people)|English]] [[Crossover (music)|classical crossover]] [[soprano]], [[actor|actress]] and [[dance]]r. 

Brightman debuted as a dancer in troupes such as [[Hot Gossip]] and later released a string of [[disco]] singles. She achieved greater fame as a [[musical theatre]] performer and partner of theatre composer [[Andrew Lloyd Webber]], originating several roles, including [[Christine Daa<U+00E9>]] in ''[[The Phantom of the Opera (1986 musical)|The Phantom of the Opera]]''. Her 1984 marriage to Lloyd Webber attracted active [[tabloid]] coverage. The couple divorced in 1990, effectively ending her musical theatre career.

After her divorce, Brightman established a position as a crossover artist with former [[Enigma (musical project)|Enigma]] producer [[Frank Peterson]]. Her style, a blend of classical vocals and pop-inspired instrumentation and arrangement, earned her further success. To date, Brightman has received over 150 [[Music recording sales certification|Gold and Platinum]] awards in 34 countries<ref name="video">Official video biography. [http://www.sarah-brightman.com]</ref> and is the only artist to hold #1 spots on the Billboard Classical and Dance charts simultaneously.

==Biography==
Sarah Brightman was born in [[Berkhamsted]], [[Hertfordshire]], [[England]] to Paula and Grenville Brightman. She was the eldest of six children. Her ambition to be an artist was apparent from an early age; she took [[ballet]] lessons starting from age three. At age eleven she attended a [[boarding school]] for theatre, where she remained despite her displeasure with the institution. Brightman auditioned for [[London]]'s [[Royal Ballet]] some time later, but was rejected.<ref>"Wrapped up in her gift". ''[[The Independent]]''. [[November 8]], [[1997]].</ref> 

At age sixteen, in 1976, Brightman joined the dance group [[Pan's People]]. After some time, she moved on and led [[Hot Gossip]], a mixed dance act who appeared regularly on ''[[The Kenny Everett Video Show]]''. The group, which was noticeably more provocative than Pan's People, had a chart-topping disco hit in 1978 with "[[I Lost My Heart to a Starship Trooper]]", a space-themed track which sold half a million copies and reached number six on the [[UK charts]]. The group released a follow-up single, "Adventures of the Love Crusader", six months later, but it was less successful, failing to chart on the UK's top 50.<ref>Clayton-Lea, Tony. "Call me Ms. Dependable". ''[[The Irish Times]]'', [[February 6]], [[1999]].</ref> Brightman, now solo, released several more disco singles in subsequent years under Whisper Records; these included "Not Having That" and a cover of the song "[[My Boyfriend's Back (song)|My Boyfriend's Back]]".<ref name="chin">Chin, Siew May. Official biography, part one. [http://www.sarah-brightman.com].</ref> However, none of these became as prominent as "I Lost My Heart to a Starship Trooper".

===1981<U+2013>1989: Stage career===
In 1981, Brightman auditioned for a role in the new musical ''[[Cats (musical)|Cats]]'' and received the role of Jemima. It was there that she met her future husband, composer Andrew Lloyd Webber; the two married in 1984. Brightman starred in several of his musicals, including ''[[Song and Dance]]'' and the [[mass (music)|mass]] ''[[Requiem (Webber)|Requiem]]'', the latter expressly written for her voice. With ''Requiem'' she earned her first [[Grammy Awards|Grammy]] nomination.<ref name="video"/>

Brightman achieved greater success with her starring role as [[Christine Daa<U+00E9>]] in Lloyd Webber's adaptation of ''[[The Phantom of the Opera (1986 musical)|The Phantom of the Opera]]''. The role of Christine, like ''Requiem'' before it, was specifically written for her.<ref name="video"/> Lloyd Webber refused to open ''The Phantom of the Opera'' on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] unless Brightman originated the role of Christine. Initially, the American [[Actors' Equity Association]] balked, due to their policy of hiring only Americans. Lloyd Webber had to agree to cast an American in a leading role in his next [[West End theatre|West End musical]] before the Equity would allow Brightman to appear (a promise he kept later in the casting for ''[[Aspects of Love]]'').<ref>''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]''. "[http://jcgi.pathfinder.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,966470,00.html Chills, Thrills, and Trapdoors]". [[January 18]], [[1988]]. Retrieved [[October 15]], [[2006]].</ref>

After leaving ''Phantom'', Brightman pursued several projects. Immediately after her departure, she performed in a tour of Lloyd Webber's music throughout England, [[Canada]], and the United States, and performed ''Requiem'' in the Soviet Union. She also released some studio recordings. These releases included the single "Anything But Lonely" from ''Aspects of Love'' and two solo albums: the 1988 album ''The Trees They Grow So High'', a compilation of traditional [[folk song]]s accompanied by [[piano]], and the 1989 album ''The Songs That Got Away'', a musical theatre compilation of songs which were cut from shows by composers such as [[Irving Berlin]] and [[Stephen Sondheim]]. By 1990, Brightman and Lloyd Webber separated. After the official divorce, Brightman was given a lead role in Lloyd Webber's ''[[Aspects of Love|Aspects]]'' in [[London]] opposite [[Michael Praed]], before transferring to [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]]. It would be her last theatre role.<ref name="chin"/>

===1990's: Solo career===
Her stage career curtailed, Brightman pursued solo recording in [[Los Angeles]]. She was inspired by the [[Germany|German]] band [[Enigma (musical project)|Enigma]] and requested to work with one of its members. Her request was answered and in 1991 she traveled to Germany to meet her future producer, [[Frank Peterson]]. Their first collaboration on a major label release (with [[A&M Records]]) was ''[[Dive (Sarah Brightman album)|Dive]]'' (1993), a loosely water-themed pop album that featured the hit "Captain Nemo" (a cover of a song by the [[Sweden|Swedish]] [[electronica]] band [[Dive (Swedish band)|Dive]]).<ref>Demalon, Tom. "[http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=10:si2m96oodepc Review: Dive]". [[All Music Guide]]. Retrieved [[February 10]], [[2007]].</ref> 

''[[Fly (Sarah Brightman album)|Fly]]'' (1995), a pop/rock album and her second collaboration with Peterson, propelled Sarah Brightman to fame in [[Europe]] with the hit "A Question of Honour". The song, introduced at the World [[Boxing]] Championship match between [[Germany|Germany's]] [[Henry Maske]] and [[Graciano Rocchigiani]], featured a mix of [[electronic dance music]], [[rock music|rock]] elements, classical strings, and excerpts from the aria "Ebben? ... Ne andr<U+00F2> lontana" from [[Alfredo Catalani]]'s opera ''[[La Wally]]''.<ref>Malich, Daniel. "[http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&token=&sql=10:txeb97r0kr0t Review: Fly]". [[All Music Guide]]. Retrieved [[February 10]], [[2007]].</ref> 
 
"Time to Say Goodbye" ("''[[Con te partir<U+00F2>]]''") was the second Brightman song debuted for Maske, this time at his retirement match. This duet with tenor [[Andrea Bocelli]] sold more than 3 million copies in Germany alone,<ref name="video"/> became Germany's highest-selling single, and was a bestseller in numerous other countries. The album eventually sold over 5 million copies worldwide. Due to the song's success, a 1996 re-issue of ''Fly'' featured "Time to Say Goodbye" as the first track. 

''Timeless'' (released in 1997, with the title ''Time to Say Goodbye'' in the United States) contained "Time to Say Goodbye" and other classical-inspired tracks such as "Just Show Me How to Love You", a duet with [[Jos<U+00E9> Cura]] (originally sung by [[Dario Baldambembo]] with the title "Tu Cosa Fai Stasera?"), a cover of the [[Queen (band)|Queen]] hit "[[Who Wants to Live Forever]]", and "Tu Quieres Volver", (originally recorded by the [[Gipsy Kings]]).

The album was a smash-hit worldwide and is possibly Brightman's most successful solo release. Her mainstream exposure in the United States also began around this time, starting with an appearance on Bocelli's December 1997 [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]] television special, duetting "Time to Say Goodbye"; later, in March 1998, her own PBS special, ''Sarah Brightman in Concert at the [[Royal Albert Hall]]'', marked the key point when she crossed from Billboard's [[Top Heatseekers]] chart to the [[Billboard 200]] chart, with ''Time to Say Goodbye''.<ref name="billboard_PBS">{{Citation | last1=Reece | first1=Doug | last2=Spahr | first2=Wolfgang | author-link= | year=[[April 4]], [[1998]] | title=PBS gives big boost to Brightman's Angel set | periodical=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] | volume=110 | issue=14 | pages=7-8 | id=ISSN 0006-2510 | url= }}</ref> Despite this, however, attempts to market songs from the album to U.S. [[Top 40 (radio format)|Top 40]] and heritage radio formats were mostly unsuccessful. <ref name="billboard_PBS" />

===2000 to present===
Subsequent albums included ''[[Eden (Sarah Brightman album)|Eden]]'' (1998) (the title track of which was a cover of a song by Belgian band [[Hooverphonic]]), and ''[[La Luna (album)|La Luna]]'' (2000). Both of these albums took the crossover beginnings she had originally introduced on ''Time to Say Goodbye'' and made them her own. Reviews, however, were mixed - [[LAUNCHcast]] deemed ''Eden'' "deliriously sappy",<ref>Dumpert, Hazel-Dawn. "[http://music.yahoo.com/read/review/12040849 Album Review: Eden]". [[Yahoo! Music]]. [[March 6]], [[2000]]. Retrieved [[August 4]], [[2006]].</ref> while [[All Music Guide]] called ''Eden'' "a winning combination"<ref>Phares, Heather. "[http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=10:dqk0ikckbb39 Review: Eden]". [[All Music Guide]]. Retrieved [[August 4]], [[2006]].</ref> and ''La Luna'' "a solid, stirring collection".<ref>Buss, Bryan. "[http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&sql=10:om2tk6gxekrw Review: La Luna]". [[All Music Guide]]. Retrieved [[August 4]], [[2006]].</ref> 

Chart performance for both albums was more uniformly positive. ''Eden'' reached #65 on the Billboard 200 charts (certified Gold for selling over 500,000 copies), and ''La Luna'' peaked at #17. In addition, both albums reached #1 on Billboard's Classical Crossover charts. At the end of 2001, ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' magazine noted Brightman as one of four classical crossover artists from the UK (the others being [[Charlotte Church]], [[Russell Watson]], and [[Bond (band)|bond]]) with albums on both the Classical Crossover and Billboard 200 charts, a phenomenon which, it said, contributed to a resurgence of UK music in the U.S. after "a historic low" in 1999.<ref name="billboard_ukartists">{{Citation | last1=Masson | first1=Gordon | last2=Newman | first2=Melinda | author-link= | year=[[December 22]], [[2001]] | title=Reversal of fortune: U.K. artists see U.S. sales rise | periodical=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] | volume=113 | issue=51 | pages=1, 51 | id=ISSN 0006-2510 | url= }}</ref>

In 2001, Brightman released ''Classics'', an album comprised of [[opera]]tic [[aria]]s and other classical pieces, including a solo version of "Time to Say Goodbye". Many of the songs on this album originally appeared on her previous albums. Reviews were somewhat better: ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'', although calling Brightman a "stronger song stylist than a singer", gave the album a grade of B-.<ref>Bernardo, Melissa Rose. "[http://www.ew.com/ew/article/review/music/0,6115,253355_4_0_,00.html Music Review: Classics]". ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]''. Retrieved [[August 5]], [[2006]].</ref>

Her 2003 album ''[[Harem (album)|Harem]]'' represented another departure: a [[Middle Eastern music|Middle Eastern-themed]] album influenced by dance music. On ''Harem'', Brightman collaborated with artists such as [[Ofra Haza]] and [[Iraq]]i singer [[Kazem al-Saher]]. [[Nigel Kennedy]] contributed violin tracks to the songs "Free" and "The War Is Over", and [[Jaz Coleman]] contributed arrangements.<ref name="video"/> 

The album peaked at #29 on the Billboard 200 charts (with sales tracked by [[Nielsen SoundScan]] figuring at approximately 333,000, or about one-third the total sales of ''La Luna''),<ref name="billboard_haremtour">{{Citation | last=Ault | first=Susanne | author-link= | year=[[April 10]], [[2004]] | title=Brightman's Harem Tour A Welcome Surprise | periodical=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] | volume=116 | issue=15 | page=17 | id=ISSN 0006-2510 | url= }}</ref> #1 on the Billboard Classical Crossover chart, and yielded a #1 dance/club single with the remix of the title track. Some time later, another single from the album (the ballad "Free", cowritten with [[Sophie B. Hawkins]]) became a second Top-10 hit on this chart. Nevertheless, radio airplay for the album's singles, at least in the U.S., was almost nonexistent.<ref name="billboard_haremtour" />

The albums ''Eden'', ''La Luna'', and ''Harem'' were accompanied by live tours which incorporated the theatricality of her stage origins. Brightman acknowledged this in an interview, saying, "They're incredibly complicated...[but also] natural. I know what works, what doesn't work, all the old tricks."<ref>"Reesman, Bryan. "Siren Soprano". Yahoo! Music. [[April 9]], [[2001]]. Retrieved [[August 4]], [[2006]].</ref> In both 2000 and 2001, Brightman was among the top 10 most popular British performers in the U.S., with concert sales grossing $7.2 million from 34 shows in 2000 and over $5 million from 21 shows in 2001.<ref name="billboard_ukartists" /> 

Most recently, the Harem tour grossed over $60 million and sold over 700,000 tickets,<ref name="video"/> $15 million and 225,000 sales of which came from the North American leg; though with ticket prices raised 30% from previous tours, average sales per venue were up 65%.<ref name="billboard_haremtour" /> In North America, Harem tour promoters Clear Channel Entertainment (now [[Live Nation]]) took the unusual step of advertising to theatre subscribers, in an effort to reach fans of Brightman's Broadway performances, and also sold VIP tickets (at $750 each) that included on-stage seating during the concert and a [[backstage pass]].<ref name="billboard_haremtour" /> 

Tour reviews have been mixed: one critic from the ''[[New York Times]]'' called the La Luna tour "not so much divine but post-human" and "unintentionally disturbing: a beautiful argument of emptiness."<ref>Powers, Ann. "[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9502E7DF133AF934A1575AC0A9669C8B63 POP REVIEW; An Ethereal Voice From On High (Up Where the Loudspeakers Are)]". ''[[The New York Times]]''.

Television specials on [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]] were produced for every Brightman album in the U.S.; a director of marketing has credited these as her number-one source of exposure in the country.<ref name="billboard_ukartists" />

Brightman released a DVD collection of her music videos on [[October 3]], [[2006]] under the title of ''[[Diva: The Video Collection]]''. ''[[Diva: The Singles Collection]]'' is the accompanying CD, released on the same date. The album marked the first time Brightman has released a greatest hits album in the United States; it reached #1 on the Billboard Classical Crossover chart. (''Classics'', from 2001, featured seven new recordings in addition to the previously-released material, and her other reflective offering, ''The Best of 1990-2000'', was a European-only release.)

Brightman was one of the artists featured on the January 2007 series of the prime time [[BBC One]] Show ''[[Just the Two of Us]]'', partnered with English [[cricket]]er [[Mark Butcher]].<ref>[http://www.bbc.co.uk/justthetwoofus/about/about.shtml BBC page]. Retrieved [[December 14]] [[2006]]</ref> The pair finished the competition in third place.

Brightman performed at the [[Concert For Diana]] in July [[2007]], singing "All I Ask Of You" from [[The_Phantom_of_the_Opera_%281986_musical%29|Phantom of the Opera]] in a duet with [[Josh Groban]].

She is currently working on a new album that she describes as having a [[gothic metal]] feel to it.<ref>The Martha Stewart Show [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhx2MMY_iW4].

A preview of the film and the song, ''Be With You: Itsumo Soba ni (Always by Your Side)'', can be found on her page on the Toshiba EMI website.<ref>[http://www.toshiba-emi.co.jp/sarah-brightman/ Sarah Brightman's Toshiba EMI webpage (in Japanese)].

==Music and voice==
Brightman has undergone vocal training first with Elizabeth Hawes, head of the [[Trinity College of Music|Trinity Music College]] in London, and later with Ellen Faul of [[Juilliard School|Juilliard]]. She has a three-octave vocal range<ref>Alter, Gaby. "[http://mixonline.com/mag/audio_sarah_brightman/index.html Tour Profile: Sarah Brightman]". [[April 1]], [[2004]]. Retrieved [[August 22]], [[2006]].</ref> that extends to an E above Soprano C.<ref name="chin"/>

David Caddick, a conductor of ''Phantom'', has stated:

<blockquote>"What is amazing about Sarah is that she has two voices, really. She can produce a pop, contemporary sound, but she can also blossom out into a light soprano. The soprano part of her voice can go up to an E natural above high C. She doesn<U+2019>t sing it full out, but it is there. Of course, she has to dance while she is singing some of the time, so it<U+2019>s all the more extraordinary."<ref name="chin"/></blockquote>

She sometimes deploys both her pop and classical voices in the same song. "Anytime, Anywhere" from ''Eden'' is among one of the songs, which is based on [[Tomaso Albinoni]]'s ''[[Adagio in G minor]]''. In that song, she starts out in classical voice, switches to pop voice temporarily, and finishes with her classical voice.<ref>Sound and Vision. [http://www.sarah-brightman.com]</ref>

Brightman's music is generally classified as classical crossover. Brightman, in a 2000 interview with ''[[People (magazine)|People]]'', dismissed the label as "horrible" but stated she understood the need for categorization.<ref>Charaipotra, Sona. ''[[People (magazine)|People Weekly]]'', [[November 6]], [[2000]].</ref>  Her music influences include 60s and 70s musicians and artists such as [[David Bowie]] and [[Pink Floyd]].<ref name="video"/> Her music alternates in style from pop/rock to classical and contemporary. The material on her albums ranges from versions of opera arias from composers such as [[Giacomo Puccini|Puccini]] (on ''Harem'', ''Eden'', and ''Timeless''), to pop songs by artists such as [[Kansas (band)|Kansas]] ("[[Dust in the Wind]]" on ''Eden''), [[Dido (singer)|Dido]] ("[[Here with Me]]" on ''La Luna''), and [[Procol Harum]] ("[[A Whiter Shade of Pale]]" on ''La Luna'').

==Personal life==
At age 18, Brightman married Andrew Graham Stewart, a music manager. This marriage ended in divorce. She met Lloyd Webber while performing in ''Cats''. [[Andrew Lloyd Webber | Lloyd Webber]] divorced his first wife, [[Sarah Hugill]], to marry Brightman in [[1984]]. During their partnership, the couple faced intense media and [[tabloid]] scrutiny. The marriage lasted until 1990, when they divorced. Brightman acknowledged the marriage in a 1999 interview as a "difficult time" but also one of much creative output.<ref>Clayton-Lea, Tony. "Call me Ms. Dependable". ''[[The Irish Times]]'', [[February 6]], [[1999]].</ref> Currently they are on friendly terms; at the 20th London anniversary of ''The Phantom of the Opera'', Lloyd Webber publicly pronounced Brightman a "wonderful woman" and "absolutely beloved mentor". In 1990, Brightman became involved with Peterson; this relationship lasted for eleven years.

Brightman has suffered several personal crises, including the [[suicide]] of her father in 1992, and two [[miscarriage]]s. In an interview with the British magazine ''[[Hello!]]'', she stated that motherhood would have been "lovely", but she accepted her destiny peaceably.<ref>Barber, Richard. ''[[Hello!
