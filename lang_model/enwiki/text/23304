{{Redirect|Atlantic City}}
'''Atlantic City''' is a [[City (New Jersey)|city]] in [[Atlantic County, New Jersey|Atlantic County]], [[New Jersey]], [[United States|USA]].  Famous for its [[boardwalk]] and [[casino|casino gambling]], it is a resort community located on [[Absecon Island]] on the coast of the [[Atlantic Ocean]].  As of the [[United States 2000 Census]], population was 40,517 in the city, and 271,015 in the combined metropolitan area.  Other municipalities on the island are [[Ventnor City, New Jersey|Ventnor City]], [[Margate City, New Jersey|Margate City]], and [[Longport, New Jersey|Longport]]. The main routes into Atlantic City are the Black Horse Pike ([[U.S. Route 322|US 322]]/[[U.S. Route 40|40]]), White Horse Pike ([[U.S. Route 30|US 30]]) and the [[Atlantic City Expressway]].

On [[May 1]], [[1854]] Atlantic City was incorporated by an Act of the [[New Jersey Legislature]].  The new city contained portions of [[Egg Harbor Township, New Jersey|Egg Harbor Township]] and [[Galloway Township, New Jersey|Galloway Township]].<ref name=Story>"The Story of New Jersey's Civil Boundaries: 1606<U+2013>1968", John P. Snyder, Bureau of Geology and Topography; Trenton, New Jersey; 1969. p. 67.</ref>

Like all major cities, Atlantic City contains distinct [[neighborhood]]s or districts. The communities are known as: The North Inlet, The South Inlet, Bungalow Park, the Marina District (also known as Back Maryland), Venice Park, Downtown (Midtown), [[Ducktown, Atlantic City|Ducktown]], Chelsea, and Chelsea Heights.

==History==
Atlantic City has always been a resort town. Its location in [[South Jersey]], hugging the Atlantic Ocean between marshlands and islands, presented itself as prime real estate for developers. The city was incorporated in 1854, the same year in which train service began, linking this remote parcel of land with [[Philadelphia]]. Atlantic City became a popular [[beach]] destination because of its proximity to Philadelphia. 

===Boardwalk===
In 1870, the first boardwalk was built along a portion of the beach to help hotel owners keep sand out of their lobbies. The idea caught on, and the boardwalk was expanded and modified several times in the following years. The historic length of the boardwalk, before the 1944 hurricane, was about 7 miles (11.2 kilometers) and it extended from Atlantic City to Longport, through Ventnor and Margate. Today, it is 4.12 miles (6.63 kilometers) long and 60 feet (20 meters) wide, reinforced with steel and concrete. The combined length of the Atlantic City and Ventnor boardwalks is approximately 5.75 miles (9.25 kilometers), currently the world's longest boardwalk.

===Piers===
Ocean Pier, the world's first oceanside amusement pier, was built in Atlantic City in 1882.<ref>[http://www.acmuseum.org/piers.html Atlantic City Museum website], accessed [[November 25]], [[2006]].</ref> Other famous piers included the Steel Pier, now used as an amusement pier (opened 1898) and the [[Million Dollar Pier]] (opened 1906), now the site of a shopping mall. (The oldest cast-iron pier in the world was built at [[Gravesend]], [[Kent]], [[England]], in 1814.)

===Historic hotels===
During the early part of the 20th century, Atlantic City went through a radical building boom. Many of the modest boarding houses that dotted the boardwalk were replaced with large hotels. Two of the city<U+2019>s most distinctive hotels were the Marlborough-Blenheim Hotel and the [[Traymore Hotel]].

In 1903, Josiah White III bought a parcel of land near Ohio Avenue and the boardwalk and built the Queen Anne style Marlborough House. The hotel was a hit and, in 1905&ndash;06, he chose to expand the hotel and bought another parcel of land next door to his Marlborough House. In an effort to make his new hotel a source of conversation, White hired the architectural firm of Price and McLanahan. The firm decided to make use of [[reinforced concrete]], a new building material invented by Jean-Louis Lambot in 1848 (Joseph Monier received the patent in 1867).  The hotel<U+2019>s Spanish and Moorish theme capped off with its signature dome and chimneys represented a step forward from other hotels that had a classically designed influence.  White named the new hotel the Blenheim and merged the two hotels into the Marlborough-Blenheim.  [[Bally's Atlantic City]] was later constructed close to this same location.

The Traymore Hotel was located at the corner of Illinois Avenue and the boardwalk. Begun in 1879 as a small boarding house, the hotel grew through a series of uncoordinated expansions. By 1914, the hotel<U+2019>s owner, Daniel White, taking a hint from the Marlborough-Blenheim, commissioned the firm of Price and McLanahan to build an even bigger hotel. Sixteen stories high, the tan brick and gold-capped hotel would become one of the city<U+2019>s best-known landmarks. The hotel made use of ocean-facing hotel rooms by jutting its wings farther from the main portion of the hotel along Pacific Avenue.

One by one, additional large hotels were constructed along the boardwalk, including the Brighton, Chelsea, Shelburne, Ambassador, Ritz Carlton, Mayflower, Madison House, and the Breakers. The Breakers had snob appeal, for only the highest class of person roomed there and enjoyed its roof top garden lounge. The Quaker-owned Chalfonte House and Haddon Hall opened in the 1890s, would by the twenties merge into the [[Chalfonte-Haddon Hall Hotel]] and would become the city's largest hotel with nearly one thousand rooms. By 1930, the Claridge, the city's last large hotel, opened its doors. The 400-room Claridge was built by a partnership that included renowned Philadelphia contractor [[John McShain]]. Nearly twenty-four stories, it would become known as the "Skyscraper By The Sea." 

===1964 Democratic National Convention===
The city hosted the [[1964 Democratic National Convention]] which nominated [[Lyndon Johnson]] for President and [[Hubert Humphrey]] as Vice President. The ticket won in a landslide that November.  The convention and the press coverage it generated, however, cast a harsh light on Atlantic City, which by then was in the midst of a long period of economic decline. Many felt that the friendship between Johnson and the [[Governor of New Jersey]] at that time, [[Richard J. Hughes]], led Atlantic City to host the Democratic Convention.

==Demise and Rebirth==
Like many older east coast cities after World War II, Atlantic City became plagued with [[poverty]], [[crime]], and disinvestment by the [[middle class]] in the mid to late 20th century. The neighborhood known as the "Inlet" became particularly impoverished. The reasons for the resort's decline were multi-layered. The automobile become available to many Americans after the war. Atlantic City had initially relied upon visitors coming by train and staying for a couple of weeks.  The car would allow people to come and go as they pleased, and many people would spend only a few days, rather than weeks.  Also, the advent of suburbia played a huge role. With many families moving to their own private houses, luxuries such as home air conditioning and swimming pools diminished the necessity for people to flock to the beach during the hot summer. Perhaps the biggest factor in the decline in Atlantic City's popularity came from cheap, fast jet service to other premiere resorts.  Places such as [[Miami Beach]] and [[Nassau, Bahamas]] superseded Atlantic City as favored vacation spots.

By the late 1960s, the typical Atlantic City tourist was invariably poor, elderly, or both. Many of the resort's great hotels, which were suffering from embarrassing vacancy rates, were either closed, converted to cheap apartments, or converted to nursing home facilities. Prior to and during the advent of legalized gambling, many of these hotels would be demolished.  The Breakers, the Chelsea, the Brighton, the Shelburne, the Mayflower, the Traymore, and the Marlborough Blenheim were demolished in the 1970s and 1980s. Of all the pre-casino resorts that bordered the boardwalk, only the Claridge, the Dennis (now part of Bally's Park Place), the Ritz Carlton, and the [[Chalfonte-Haddon Hall Hotel]] survive to this day. The steel frame work of the old Ambassodor Hotel was used for the Tropicana Hotel and Casino, although its distinctive brick facade was removed and replaced with a more modern one. Smaller hotels off the boardwalk, such as the Madison House, also survive.  

In an effort at revitalizing the city, [[New Jersey]] voters in 1976 approved [[casino]] [[gambling]] for  Atlantic City; this came after a 1974 referendum on legalized gambling failed to pass. The Chalfonte-Haddon Hall Hotel became Resorts International and was the first legal casino in the eastern [[United States]] when it opened on [[May 26]], [[1978]]. Other casinos were soon added along the Boardwalk and later in the marina district for a total of thirteen today. The introduction of gambling did not, however, quickly eliminate many of the urban problems that plagued Atlantic City. Many have argued that it only served to magnify those problems, as evidenced in the stark contrast between tourism-intensive areas and the adjacent impoverished working-class neighborhoods. <ref>Bryant Simon, ''Boardwalk of Dreams: Atlantic City and the Fate of Urban America'' (New York: Oxford University Press, 2004).</ref> Drug-infested tenements in poor condition stand directly beside multi-billion dollar casino hotels along the ocean in some locations. In addition, Atlantic City has played second-fiddle to [[Las Vegas, Nevada]], as a gambling mecca in the United States, although in the late 1970s and 1980s, when Las Vegas was experiencing a massive drop in tourism due to crime, particularly the [[Mafia]]'s role, and other economic factors, Atlantic City was favored over Las Vegas.  The rise of Mike Tyson in boxing, having most of his fights in Atlantic City in the '80s, also helped Atlantic City's popularity. On [[July 3]], [[2003]], Atlantic City's newest casino, [[Borgata|The Borgata]], opened with much success. Another major attraction is the oldest remaining [[Ripley's Believe It or Not!]] [[Odditorium]] in the world. 

Atlantic City is home to [[New Jersey|New Jersey's]] first [[wind farm]]. The [[Jersey-Atlantic Wind Farm]] consists of five 1.5 MW turbine towers, each almost 400 feet (120 meters) high.

Gambling was stopped for the first time since 1978 at 8:00 a.m. on [[July 5]], [[2006]], during the [[2006 New Jersey State Government Shutdown]] mandated by Governor [[Jon Corzine]].  The casinos generally remained open for entertainment and hotel services, but ceased gambling functions due to the absence of state regulators. The casinos resumed gambling functions at 7:00 p.m. on [[July 8]], [[2006]].

From 2005 to 2006, Atlantic City had the highest percentage increase (25.9%) in average home value in the United States.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://money.cnn.com/2007/02/15/real_estate/latest_prices_q4/index.htm?postversion=2007021514|publisher=money.cnn.com|accessdate=2007-06-21|title=Latest home prices}}</ref>

==Geography==
Atlantic City is located at {{coor dms|39|21|54|N|74|26|21|W|city}} (39.364966, -74.439034){{GR|1}}.

According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of 44.9 [[km<U+00B2>]] (17.4 [[square mile|mi<U+00B2>]]).  29.4 km<U+00B2> (11.4 mi<U+00B2>) of it is land and 15.5 km<U+00B2> (6.0 mi<U+00B2>) of it (34.58%) is water.

==Climate==
Atlantic City has a humid continental climate, but it is almost on the borderline of the humid continental/subtropical climate zones.  In the winter, the city does not get as much snowfall as northern New Jersey or inland areas because it is moderated by the ocean. In the summer, Atlantic City gets a sea breeze off the ocean that makes temperatures stay cooler than inland areas.

The estimated travel time will be 2<U+00BD> hours with a few stops along the way and is part of the Casinos' multi-million dollar investments in Atlantic City. Most of the funding for the new transit line will be provided by [[Harrah's Entertainment]] (owners of both [[Harrah's Atlantic City]] and [[Caesars Atlantic City]]) and the [[Borgata]]. The line is expected to be in service by the end of 2007, but details on the line's operation are scant.<ref>[http://www.njtransit.com/nn_press_release.jsp?PRESS_RELEASE_ID=2232 NJ TRANSIT BOARD APPROVES NEW YORK <U+2013> ATLANTIC CITY EXPRESS RAIL SERVICE] press release, accessed [[June 20]], [[2006]].</ref>

*Atlantic City has been a rather frequent subject in popular culture.  The eccentric 1972 [[Bob Rafelson]] film ''[[The King of Marvin Gardens]]'' with [[Jack Nicholson]], [[Bruce Dern]], and [[Ellen Burstyn]] was shot on location there and strongly conveys a feel for the pre-casino/post-glory-days limbo the city was mired in at the time.  The powerful Oscar-nominated 1981 movie, ''[[Atlantic City (movie)|Atlantic City]]'', by French director [[Louis Malle]], starring [[Burt Lancaster]] and [[Susan Sarandon]], reflects the city at the dawn of its casino-driven "rebirth".  Atlantic City is cited as the Sundance Kid's birthplace in the 1969 classic western film, ''[[Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid]]''.

Banners on the boardwalk in the show read "Atlantic City: Where New York comes to smoke".
