The '''War on Terrorism''' or '''War on Terror''' (also the "Global War on Terrorism" or "GWOT" <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dscc.dla.mil/offices/land/gwot.html|title=Momentum & Sustainment: Supporting the Warfighter|date=[[September 23]], [[2004]]|publisher=Defense Supply Center  Colombus|accessdate= 2006-08-09}}</ref>) is a campaign by the [[United States]], enlisting the support of [[NATO]] members and other allies, with the stated goal of ending [[international terrorism|international]] [[terrorism]] by stopping those groups said to be [[terrorist groups]], and ending [[State-sponsored terrorism|state sponsorship of terrorism]]. This campaign was launched by the [[George W. Bush administration|Bush administration]] following the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]] on [[New York City|New York]] and [[Washington, D.C.]] by [[al-Qaeda]].

== Overview ==
{{see also|Terrorism|List of terrorist incidents}}
Terrorist organizations had carried out attacks on the [[United States]] and allies throughout the latter part of the 20th century, prompting occasional responses. Following the [[1998 United States embassy bombings|1998 embassy bombings]] in [[Kenya]] and [[Tanzania]],<ref>{{cite news|title=Report of the Accountability Review Boards |publisher=U.S. Department of State |date=08.07.98 |url=http://www.state.gov/www/regions/africa/board_introduction.html}}</ref> [[United States]] President [[Bill Clinton]] launched [[Operation Infinite Reach]], a bombing campaign in [[Sudan]] and [[Afghanistan]] against targets associated with [[Al-Qaeda]].<ref>{{cite news|title=U.S. strikes terrorist targets in Afghanistan,Sudan |publisher=CNN |date=08.20.98 |url=http://www.cnn.com/US/9808/20/clinton.02/index.html?eref=sitesearch}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=U.S. retaliates for Africa bombings |publisher=CNN |date=08.20.98 |url=http://www.cnn.com/US/9808/20/clinton.01/index.html?eref=sitesearch}}</ref> Later, the [[USS Cole bombing]] in 2000 occured,<ref>{{cite news|title=U.S. sailors killed in attack on Navy vessel in Yemen |publisher=CNN |date=10.12.00 |
url=http://www.cnn.com/2000/US/10/12/ship.rammed.03/index.html?eref=sitesearch}}</ref> followed by the [[September 11 terrorist attack|September 11th, 2001 terrorist attack.]]<ref>{{cite news|title=What proof of bin Laden's involvement |publisher=CNN |date=09.13.01 |url=http://cnn.com/2001/US/09/13/binladen.evidence/index.html?eref=sitesearch}}</ref> The scope of the attack was far larger than previous attacks, and created an immediate demand for a response against those responsible throughout the [[United States]].

===Historical usage of phrase===
The phrase "War on Terrorism" was first widely used by the Western [[news|press]] to refer to the attempts by Russian and European governments, and eventually the U.S. government, to stop attacks by [[anarchist]]s against international political leaders.  (See, for example, ''New York Times'', [[April 2]] [[1881]]).  Many of the anarchists described themselves as "terrorists", and the term had a positive valence for them at the time.  When Russian Marxist [[Vera Zasulich]] shot and wounded a Russian police commander who was known to torture suspects on [[24 January]] [[1878]], for example, she threw down her weapon without killing him, announcing, "I am a terrorist, not a killer." <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.anthropoetics.ucla.edu/ap0801/terror.htm#n16|title=The Four Waves of Rebel Terror and September 11|date=Summer [[2004]]|publisher=Department of Political Science
University of California at Los Angeles|accessdate= 2006-08-09}}</ref> 

The next time the phrase gained currency was its use to describe the efforts by the British colonial government to end a spate of Jewish terrorist attacks in the [[British Mandate of Palestine]] in the late 1940s.  The British proclaimed a "War on Terrorism" and attempted to crack down on [[Irgun]], [[Lehi (group)|Lehi]], and anyone perceived to be cooperating with them.  The Jewish attacks, Arab reprisals, and the subsequent British crackdown hastened the British evacuation from Palestine. <ref>{{cite news|title=War on Terrorism |publisher=Aljazeera.Com |date=01.01.03 |url=http://www.aljazeera.com/me.asp?service_ID=10248}}</ref>

===Operative definition in U.S. foreign policy===
The United States has defined terrorism under the Federal Criminal Code. Chapter 113B of Part I of Title 18 of the United States Code defines terrorism and lists the crimes associated with terrorism.<ref>CRIMES AND CRIMINAL PROCEDURE [http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/casecode/uscodes/18/parts/i/chapters/113b/toc.html]</ref>
In          
Section 2331 of Chapter 113b, terrorism is defined as:
:"..activities that involve violent... <or life-threatening acts>... that are a violation of the criminal laws of the United States or of any State and... appear to be intended (i) to intimidate or coerce a civilian population; (ii) to influence the policy of a government by intimidation or coercion; or (iii) to affect the conduct of a government by mass destruction, assassination, or kidnapping; and ...<if domestic>...(C) occur primarily within the territorial jurisdiction of the United States...<if international>...(C) occur primarily outside the territorial jurisdiction of the United States..."
With respect to defining his policy known as the War on Terror, President Bush has stated that:
:"...today's war on terror is like the Cold War. It is an ideological struggle with an enemy that despises freedom and pursues totalitarian aims....I vowed then that I would use all assets of our power to win the war on terror. And so I said we were going to stay on the offense two ways: one, hunt down the enemy and bring them to justice, and take threats seriously; and two, spread freedom. " <ref>Remarks by President Bush on the Global War on Terror[http://www.state.gov/r/pa/ei/wh/rem/64287.htm]</ref>

===Objective and strategies===
The United States has based its counterterrorist strategy on several steps: <ref>NAT I O N A L

==Campaigns and theatres of operations==
{{terrorism}}
{{main|War on Terrorism - Theaters of operation}}

The "War on Terrorism" is being pursued in the following theaters of operation:
* Africa -  [[Djibouti]] ([[Operation Enduring Freedom - Horn of Africa|OEF-HOA]]), [[Ethiopia]] ([[Operation Enduring Freedom - Horn of Africa|OEF-HOA]]), [[Eritrea]] ([[Operation Enduring Freedom - Horn of Africa|OEF-HOA]]), [[Kenya]] ([[Operation Enduring Freedom - Horn of Africa|OEF-HOA]]), [[Somalia]] ([[Operation Enduring Freedom - Horn of Africa|OEF-HOA]]), [[Sudan]] ([[Operation Enduring Freedom - Horn of Africa|OEF-HOA]]), and [[Tanzania]] ([[Operation Enduring Freedom - Horn of Africa|OEF-HOA]])
* Middle East - [[Iraq]] ([[Iraq War|OIF]]), [[Lebanon]] ([[2006 Israel-Lebanon conflict|OCD]])
* South Asia - [[Afghanistan]] ([[United States war in Afghanistan|OEF-A]]) and [[Pakistan]] ([[Waziristan War]])
* Southeast Asia [[Philippines]] ([[Operation Enduring Freedom - Philippines|OEF-P]]), [[Thailand]] and [[Indonesia]]

===Africa===
{{main|Operation Enduring Freedom - Horn of Africa}}
[[Image:800px-Dragunov_on_range.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Combined Joint Task Force training in [[Ethiopia]].]]
This extension of Operation Enduring Freedom, titled OEF-HOA, was initiated in response to the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]] on the [[United States]]. Unlike other operations contained in [[Operation Enduring Freedom]], OEF-HOA does not have a specific terrorist organization as a target. OEF-HOA instead focuses its efforts to disrupt and detect terrorist activities in the region and, to work with host nations to deny the reemergence of terrorist cells and activities. 

In October 2002, the Combined Joint Task Force, Horn of Africa (CJTF-HOA) was established in [[Djibouti]] at [[Camp Le Monier]] and contains approximately 2,000 personnel including U.S. military and Special Operations Forces (SOF) and coalition force members, Coalition Task Force 150 (CTF-150). The coalition force members consist of ships from [[Australia]], [[Canada]], [[France]], [[Germany]], [[Italy]], [[Pakistan]], [[New Zealand]], [[Spain]] and the [[United Kingdom]]. The primary goal of the coalition forces is to monitor, inspect, board and stop suspected shipments from entering the Horn of Africa region and areas of [[Operation Iraqi Freedom]]. <ref>CRS Report for Congress[http://www.senate.gov/member/al/shelby/general/legislation/Terrorism.pdf]</ref> Included in the operation is the training of selected armed forces units of the countries of Djibouti, [[Kenya]] and [[Ethiopia]] in counterterrorism and counterinsurgency tactics. Humanitarian efforts conducted by CJTF-HOA include rebuilding of schools and medical clinics as well as providing medical services to those countries who forces are being trained. The program expands as part of the Trans-Saharan Counter Terrorism Initiative as CJTF personnel also assist in training the forces of [[Chad]], [[Niger]], [[Mauritania]] and [[Mali]]. <ref>CRS Report for Congress[http://www.senate.gov/member/al/shelby/general/legislation/Terrorism.pdf]</ref>

===Middle East===
====Iraq War====
{{main|2003 Invasion of Iraq|Iraq War}}
[[Iraq]] had been listed as a [[U.S. list of state sponsors of international terrorism|State Sponsor of Terror]] by the United States since [[1990]],<ref>{{cite news|title=Iraq accuses U.S., Turkey of 'illegally' meeting with Kurds |publisher=CNN |date=03.09.00 |url=http://archives.cnn.com/2000/WORLD/meast/03/09/un.iraq/index.html}}</ref> and maintained poor relations with the United States since the [[Gulf War]]. Tensions were high throughout the 1990's, with the [[United States]] launching [[Operation Desert Fox]] against Iraq after it expelled UN Weapons Inspectors in [[1998]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Clinton: Iraq has abused its final chance |publisher=CNN |date=12.16.98 |url=http://www.cnn.com/ALLPOLITICS/stories/1998/12/16/clinton/index.html?eref=sitesearch}}</ref> After the September 11 attacks, fears that Iraq could use its Weapons of Mass Destruction program to aid terrorist groups began to grow, leading the [[George W. Bush]] administration to call for a UNSC resolution.<ref>{{cite news|title=Iraq weighs U.N. resolution |publisher=CNN |date=11.09.02 |url=http://archives.cnn.com/2002/US/11/09/iraq.resolution/index.html}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Bush's remarks after U.N. passes iraq resolution |publisher=CNN |date=11.08.02 |url=http://archives.cnn.com/2002/US/11/08/bush.transcript/}}</ref> [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1441]] was passed unanimously, which offered Iraq ''"a final opportunity to comply with its disarmament obligations"'' or face "serious consequences." Saddam Hussein subsequently allowed UN inspectors to access some Iraqi sites, while the U.S. government continued to say that Iraq was being obstructionist, due to the fact that there were numerous sites made unavailable for inspection. The use of force against Iraq was authorized by the United States Congress in October 2002 in order to ''"prosecute the war on terrorism."'' <ref>{{cite news|title=Joint Resolution to Authorize the Use of United States Armed Forces Against Iraq  |date=[[2002-10-02]] |publisher=[[White House]] |url=http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2002/10/20021002-2.html}}</ref> After failing to overcome opposition from [[France]], [[Russia]], and [[China]] against a UNSC resolution that would sanction the use of force against Iraq, it instead assembled a [[Coalition of the Willing]] composed of nations who pledged support for a war against Iraq.<ref>{{cite news|title=Bush:Join 'coalition of willing' |publisher=CNN |date=11.20.02 |url=http://cnn.com/2002/WORLD/europe/11/20/prague.bush.nato/index.html?eref=sitesearch}}</ref> On [[March 19]]th, [[2003]], the [[2003 Invasion of Iraq|invasion]] of Iraq was launched in what was touted as the "serious consequences" spoken of in UNSC Resolution 1441.

[[Saddam Hussein]]'s regime was quickly toppled and on [[May 1]], [[2003]], [[George W. Bush]] stated major combat operations against his regime had ended, effectively announcing victory against Saddam. But the war continued on as an [[Iraqi Insurgency|insurgency]], at first from loyalists and later by radical elements such as [[Al Qaeda in Iraq]]. Nearly 2,600 soldiers from the coalition have been killed, with an estimated 67,000 Insurgents also killed.

====Lebanon====
{{main|Cedar Revolution|2006 Israel-Lebanon conflict}}
[[Syria]] and [[Lebanon]] are hosting the headquarters of several terrorist organizations (according to the [[State Department]] list and the [[EU]] list) such as [[Hezbollah]], [[Hamas]] and [[Palestinian Islamic Jihad]]. The White House declared it holds Syria accountable for supporting terrorism and officially implemented [http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2004/05/20040511-7.html sanctions] on [[May 11]] [[2004]].
			
The situation got even more tense with the assassination of former Lebanese Prime Minister [[Rafik Hariri]] by a bomb in downtown [[Beirut]], Lebanon's capital, on [[February 14]] [[2005]]. Although exactly who ordered the assassination remains unclear (an obscure militant group claimed responsibility), protests erupted in Beirut demanding that the Syrian troops stationed in Lebanon leave. President Bush, Europe, and Saudi Arabia also put pressure on Syrian President [[Bashar Assad]] to honor his promises according to the 1989 [[Taif Agreement]] and pull out of Lebanon. The Shi'ite militant group [[Hezbollah]] is the largest political party in Lebanon, but has been declared by the U.S. State Department to be a terrorist organization with ties to Iran. It began an [[2006 Israel-Lebanon conflict|open conflict]] with [[Israel]] in [[July 2006]], which led Israel to respond militarilly as a part of the "War on Terrorism."

====Afghanistan====
{{main|United States war in Afghanistan}}
In October 2001 in the wake of the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]] on the United States, the U.S and NATO members invaded the country of [[Afghanistan]] to remove al-Qaeda forces and punish the [[Taliban]] regime which had taken over the country. On [[September 20]], [[2001]] George W. Bush delivered an ultimatum to the Taliban regime to turn over Osama bin Laden and al-Qaeda leaders operating in the country.<ref>{{cite news|title=Transcript of President Bush's address |publisher=CNN |date=9.20.01 |url=http://www.cnn.com/2001/US/09/20/gen.bush.transcript/}}</ref> The Taliban demanded evidence of bin Laden's link to the September 11th attacks and, if such evidence warranted a trial, they offered to handle such trial in an Islamic Court. <ref>{{cite news|title=Taliban rejects president Bush's demands |publisher=PBS |date=09.21.01 |url=http://www.pbs.org/newshour/updates/september01/taliban_9-21.html}}</ref> As the invasion became more immenent the Taliban government offered to extradite bin Laden to a neutral nation, this offer was seen by Bush as insincere.

====Pakistan====
{{main|Waziristan War}}
In 2004 the [[Pakistani Army]] launched a campaign in the [[Federally Administered Tribal Areas]] of Pakistans [[Waziristan]] region. The goal of the conflict is to remove the al-Qaeda and Taliban forces in the region. After the fall of the Taliban regime many members of the Taliban resistance fled to the Northern border region of Afghanistan and Pakistan where the Pakistani army had previously little control. With the logistics and air support of the United States, the Pakistani Army has captured or killed numerous al-Qaeda operatives such as [[Khalid Shaikh Mohammed]], wanted for his involvement in the [[USS Cole bombing]], [[Oplan Bojinka]] plot and the killing of [[Wall Street Journal]] reporter [[Daniel Pearl]]. The Taliban resistance still operates in the Federally Administered Tribal Areas under the control of [[Haji Omar]]. <ref>{{cite news|title=Top al Qaeda operative caught in Pakistan |publisher=CNN |date=03.01.03 |url=http://www.cnn.com/2003/WORLD/asiapcf/south/03/01/pakistan.arrests/}}</ref>

[[Image:Australian embassy bombing flag.jpg|thumb|right|Australian Embassy in Jakarta after [[September 9]], [[2004]] suicide bombing.]]
In 2002 and again in 2005, the Indonesian island of [[Bali]] has been struck by suicide and car bombings that killed over 200 people and injured over 300. The 2002 attack consisted of a bomb hidden in a backpack exploding inside of "Padds's Bar", a remote controlled car bomb exploding in front of the "Sari Club" and a third explosion in from of the American consulate in Bali. The 2005 attack consisted of 2 suicide bombings, the first near a food court in [[Jimbaran]], the second in the main square of [[Kuta]]. The group Jemaah Islamiyah is suspected of carrying out both attacks by Indonesian authorities.

{{main|2004 Jakarta embassy bombing}}
On [[September 9]], [[2004]] a car bomb exploded outside of the Australian embassy in [[Jakarta]], killing 10 Indonesians and injuring over 140 others; despite conflicting initial reports there were no Australian casualties.<ref>{{cite news|title=JI 'claims Jakarta car bombing' |publisher=CNN |date=09.09.04 |url=http://cnn.com/2004/WORLD/asiapcf/09/09/indonesia.blast/index.html?eref=sitesearch}}</ref> Foreign Minister [[Alexander Downer]] reported that a mobile phone [[text message]] was sent to Indonesian authorities before the bombing warning of attacks if [[Abu Bakar Bashir]] was not released from prison.<ref>{{cite news|title=Text 'warned of Jakarta bomb' |publisher=CNN |date=09.10.04 |url=http://www.cnn.com/2004/WORLD/asiapcf/09/10/indonesia.blast/index.html}}</ref> Abu Bakar Ba'asyir was imprisoned on charged of [[treason]] for his support of the 2002 and 2005 Bali bombings.<ref>{{cite news|title=Jihad warning over Indonesian cleric arrest |publisher=CNN |date=10.10.02 |url=http://cnn.com/2002/WORLD/asiapcf/southeast/10/10/indo.baasyir/index.html?eref=sitesearch}}</ref> Currently Jemaah Islamiyah is suspected of carrying out the attacks and Noordin Mohammed Top is a prime suspect, Top is a bomb maker and explosions expert for Jemaah Islamiyah.<ref>{{cite news|title='Walking bombs' are desperate |publisher=CNN |date=11.01.03 |url=http://www.cnn.com/2003/WORLD/asiapcf/southeast/11/01/indon.walkbomb/index.html}}</ref>

====Philippines====
{{main|Operation Enduring Freedom - Philippines}}
In January 2002 the [[United States Special Operations Command|United States Special Operations Command, Pacific]] deployed to the Philippines to advise and assist the [[Armed Forces of the Philippines]] in combating terrorism. The operations was mainly focused on removing the [[Abu Sayyaf Group]] (ASG) and [[Jemaah Islamiyah]] (JI) from their stronghold on the island of [[Basilan]]. The United States military has reported that they have removed over 80% of the Abu Sayyaf Group members from the region. The second portion of the operation was conducted as a humanitarian program called "Operation Smiles", the goal of the program was to provide medical care and services to the region of Basilan to prevent the ability for members of the terrorist groups to reestablish themselves.

==International support==
On [[September 12]], [[2001]], less than 24 hours after the terrorist attacks in [[New York City]] and [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]], [[NATO]] invoked Article 5 of the [[North Atlantic Treaty]] and declared the attacks to be an attack against all 19 NATO member countries. 

In the following months, NATO took a wide range of measures to respond to the threat of terrorism. On [[November 22]], [[2002]], the member states of the [[Euro-Atlantic Partnership Council|EAPC]] decided on a Partnership Action Plan against Terrorism  which explicitly states that "EAPC States are committed to the protection and promotion of fundamental freedoms and human rights, as well as the rule of law, in combating terrorism." <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.forces.gc.ca/site/Newsroom/view_news_e.asp?id=1703|title=Partnership Action Plan against Terrorism|date=[[November 22]], [[2002]]|publisher=NATO|accessdate= 2006-08-09}}</ref> NATO started naval operations in the [[Mediterranean Sea]] designed to prevent the movement of terrorists or [[weapons of mass destruction]] as well as to enhance the security of [[shipping]] in general called [[Operation Active Endeavour]].

The invasion of Afghanistan is seen as the first action of this war, and initially involved forces from the [[United States]], the [[United Kingdom]], and the Afghani [[Northern Alliance]]. Since the initial invasion period, these forces have been augmented by troops from [[Australia]], [[Canada]], [[Germany]], [[Italy]], [[Netherlands]], [[New Zealand]] and [[Norway]]. It was announced on [[January 27]] [[2006]] in the [[British Parliament]] that a NATO [[International Security Assistance Force]] (ISAF) would be replacing the U.S troops in the province as part of Operation Enduring Freedom. The [[British 16th Air Assault Brigade]] would be the core of the force in Southern Afghanistan, along with troops and helicopters from Australia, Canada and the Netherlands. The force will consist of roughly 3,300 British, 2,000 Canadian, 1,400 from the Netherlands and 240 from Australia. <ref>{{cite news|title=UK troops take over Afghan duties|date=[[2006-06-01]]|publisher=[[BBC]]|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/4961368.stm}}</ref> <ref>{{cite news|title=Canada set for longer Afghan stay |date=[[2006-06-16]] |publisher=[[BBC]] |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/4984880.stm}}</ref> <ref>{{cite news|title=Australia outlines Afghan force|date=[[2006-05-08]]|publisher=[[BBC]]|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/4983540.stm}}</ref>

Support for the United States cooled when America made clear its determination to invade Iraq in late 2002. Even so, many of the "[[coalition of the willing]]" countries that unconditionally supported the U.S.-led military action have sent troops to [[Afghanistan]], particular neighbouring [[Pakistan]] which has disowned its earlier support for the Taliban and contributed tens of thousands of soldiers to the conflict. Pakistan is also currently engaged in the [[Waziristan War]], supported by US intelligence, Pakistan is attempting to remove the Taliban insurgency and al-Qaeda element from the northern tribal areas.<ref>{{cite news|title=New frontline in the war on terror |publisher=The Guardian |date=05.04.06 |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/pakistan/Story/0,,1767031,00.html}}</ref>

A $40 billion emergency spending bill was quickly passed by the [[Congress of the United States|United States Congress]], and an additional $20 billion bail-out of the airline industry was also passed.  

Investigations have been started through many branches of many governments, pursuing tens of thousands of tips. Thousands of people have been detained, arrested, or questioned.  Many of those targeted by the Bush administration have been secretly detained, and have been denied access to an attorney.  Among those secretly detained are U.S. citizens.  

The Justice Department launched a [[Special Registration]] procedure for certain male non-citizens in the U.S., requiring them to register in person at offices of the Immigration and Naturalization Service.  

Several laws were passed to increase the investigative powers of law enforcement agencies in the United States, notably the [[USA Patriot Act]]. Many civil liberties groups have alleged that these laws remove important restrictions on governmental authority, and are a dangerous encroachment on civil liberties, possible [[Constitutionality|unconstitutional]] violations of the [[Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourth Amendment]]. No official legal challenges have been started [[as of 2004]], but governing bodies in a number of communities have passed symbolic resolutions against the act.

In a speech on [[June 9]], [[2005]], Bush claimed that the "Patriot Act" had been used to bring charges against more than 400 suspects, more than half of whom had been convicted.  Meanwhile the [[American Civil Liberties Union]] quoted Justice Department figures showing that 7,000 people have complained of abuse of the Act. The ACLU also maintains that many others do not know they have been subjected to a search because the law requires that searches be kept secret. 

The Bush administration began an unprecedented and sweeping initiative in early 2002 with the creation of the [[Information Awareness Office]], designed to collect, index, and consolidate all available information on everyone in a central repository for perusal by the United States government.

Various government bureaucracies which handled security and military functions were reorganized.  Most notably, the [[Department of Homeland Security]] was created to coordinate "homeland security" efforts in the largest reorganization of the U.S. federal government since the consolidation of the armed forces into the Department of Defense.  There was a proposal to create an [[Office of Strategic Influence]] for the purpose of coordinating propaganda efforts, but it was cancelled due to negative reactions.
