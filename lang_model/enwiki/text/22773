'''Wardell Milan''' is a [[New York City]] based visual artist known for works on paper: drawings and collage, often blended together. He is also known for photographs of dense semi-autobiographical tabletop dioramas. His drawings generally incorporate figures, and are said to occupy a "space between beauty and ugliness."<ref name=Ground>{{cite web|url=http://www.thegroundmag.com/unbreakable-beauty-in-wardell-milans-drawings/|title=The Ground Magazine, Mar. 9 2012 - Unbreakable Beauty in Wardell Milan<U+2019>s Drawings, By Joe Sutton}}</ref>
