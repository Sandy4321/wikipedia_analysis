Since its beginning in [[2000]], the concept and implementation of [[UK]] [[Big Brother (UK)|edition]] of the [[reality TV|reality]] [[game show]] ''[[Big Brother (TV series)|Big Brother]]'' has regularly been the subject of controversy and criticism among the British public and news media. There have been various investigations by numerous organisations, including [[Watchdog journalism|TV watchdogs]] and the [[police]].

==Accusations of cheating==
===''[[Big Brother 1 (UK)|Big Brother 1]]''===
In this first series, "Nasty" [[Nick Bateman]] was asked to leave the show after thirty six days after being exposed trying to [[Tactical manipulation of runoff voting|manipulate]] fellow housemates' votes in the weekly eviction process.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1353157/Nasty-Nick-is-evicted-for-his-double-dealing.html | work=The Daily Telegraph | location=London | title='Nasty' Nick is evicted for his double-dealing | first=Tom | last=Leonard | date=18 August 2000 | accessdate=30 April 2010}}</ref> Ironically he was the most popular housemate at the time. Such was the media interest in this first series of the show, the news that Nick had been thrown out featured on the front page of every national newspaper in the UK, apart from the ''[[Financial Times]]'' which found the story on page 3.

===''[[Big Brother 7 (UK)|Big Brother 7]]''===
Seven days into the show, Housemate [[List_of_Big_Brother_2006_housemates_(UK)#Dawn|Dawn Blake]] received a message in the house from her family, via Big Brother, informing her that her sister was ill. It was later revealed that this was a code, which she had set up with her family to give her, had there been any negative publicity regarding her appearance. Having decided that she had broken the rule regarding contact with the outside world, Big Brother removed her from the house.

Subsequently, Dawn complained to Ofcom, saying that she was unfairly represented on the programme (and some editions of ''[[Big Brother's Little Brother]]'' and ''[[Big Brother's Big Mouth]]'') regarding accusations of cheating, her body odour and being kept in the house against her will. Her complaints were not upheld.<ref>http://www.ofcom.org.uk/tv/obb/prog_cb/obb110/issue110.pdf</ref>

==Bullying and prejudice from housemates==
Throughout several series of the show, several housemates have been accused of bullying and prejudice towards other housemates, including [[racism]] and [[homophobia]].

===''[[Celebrity Big Brother 2005 (UK)|Celebrity Big Brother 3]]''===
Academic and writer [[Germaine Greer]] decided to leave this series; one of her primary stated reasons was that she felt that the Big Brother environment was fostering an atmosphere in which bullying behaviour towards racing commentator [[John McCririck]] was deemed acceptable and exacerbated.

===''[[Big Brother 2005 (UK)|Big Brother 6]]''===
In Week 2 of the sixth series, Lesley Sanderson began bullying Sam Heuston, often making remarks about Sam's body, and threatening Sam with violence. Big Brother gave Lesley a warning and the pair made up. However, Sam was verbally attacked by fellow housemate Derek Laud. Despite Derek and Sam initially getting the most nomination votes, the entire house was put up for the public vote as punishment for fellow housemate Vanessa McIntosh discussing that she would nominate Sam. Because of this punishment, Lesley became the second evictee, and left the house to a harsh reception.

Later in the series, Orlaith McAllister quit the show after claiming she was being bullied by Derek Laud.

At various points, in this series the housemates seemed to form two separate groups, and it was commentated both by the housemates themselves and in the press that this separation was along race lines (though there was never any explicit suggestion that this was anything more than coincidence).

===''[[Celebrity Big Brother 2007 (UK)|Celebrity Big Brother 5]]''===
{{main|Celebrity Big Brother racism controversy}}
In perhaps the most controversial series of the show, the fifth celebrity series sparked a worldwide debate, created by [[Jade Goody]], singer [[Jo O'Meara]] and model [[Danielle Lloyd]]. The row was sparked when alleged racist comments were made about Bollywood actress and fellow housemate [[Shilpa Shetty]]. A record number of over 45,000 complaints were recorded for the unfair behaviour, bullying and racism in the Big Brother House, with protests across [[India]]. The then [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] (now former [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]]) [[Gordon Brown]], visiting India at the time, found himself answering questions on Big Brother throughout his trip, and a wider debate on racism in the UK was raised by the media. The three housemates involved were evicted by the usual public vote. Their normally lighthearted eviction interview was serious in tone, and began by showing clips of international news bulletins and newspaper front pages. Shilpa emerged as the winner of the series. Following the incident, [[Channel 4]] was heavily criticised by [[Ofcom]] for not acting quickly enough, and was forced to apologise on air three times during the following series.

===''[[Big Brother 8 (UK)|Big Brother 8]]''===
'''Racist language''' 

Nine days into the new series, Channel 4 was criticised for deciding to air the word "[[nigger]]" on their daily highlights show.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.aol.co.uk/new-racism-row-engulfs-big-brother/article/20070607053109990001|title=New Racism Row Engulfs ''Big Brother'' |publisher=AOL.co.uk|accessdate=2007-06-07 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070610201754/http://news.aol.co.uk/new-racism-row-engulfs-big-brother/article/20070607053109990001 <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2007-06-10}}</ref> After the criticism they received for not handling the [[Celebrity Big Brother 2007 (UK)|''Celebrity Big Brother'']] racism allegations properly back in January, they were quick to intervene after [[Emily Parr]] used the word in conversation with [[Charley Uchea]]. On the other hand, Charley and [[Nicky Maxwell]] subsequently used the same contentious word several times, in reference to Emily's use. No action was seen to be taken against them.<ref name="day 8 highlights">{{cite episode|title=Day 8 Programme | series = Big Brother | network = [[Channel 4]]| city=[[Hertfordshire]], [[England]] | airdate=2007-06-07}}</ref> After Emily's disqualification from the competition was announced, 922 viewers complained to [[Ofcom]], the British television regulator, believing that it was unfair.<ref name="Ofcom1">[http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/bigbrother8/a60165/1000-viewers-say-emilys-bb-ejection-was-wrong.html 1,000 viewers say Emily's 'BB' ejection was wrong] ''Digital Spy''</ref> Another 270 people expressed dissatisfaction with Channel 4's decision to air the word "nigger" uncensored.<ref name="Ofcom1"/>

Furthermore, on Day 40, Channel 4 confirmed that Charley had been called to the Diary Room and reprimanded after using the word "nigger" twice on one night. This was not broadcast on the nightly highlights programme or the live feed, further inflaming rumours about favouritism towards Charley. A Big Brother spokesperson claimed ''"Charley used the N-word as a black woman to refer to another black person. We judged her use of the term different from Emily's. But Big Brother called her to the Diary Room to remind her that this word could cause offence."''<ref>[http://www.sundaymirror.co.uk/news/sunday/2007/07/08/chanelle-rushed-to-see-docs-98487-19423026/ Sunday Mirror: Chanelle Rushed To See Docs].

'''Slander'''

Charley was given a third and final warning by Big Brother on Day 55 when she implied that housemate [[Gerry Stergiopoulos]] was a paedophile. Over 300 people complained to Ofcom when Charley said that Gerry liked to "sleep with 15-year-olds".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/pages/live/articles/showbiz/bigbrother.html?in_article_id=470238&in_page_id=1815|title=Big Brother Day 55: Charley's 'paedophile' row with Gerry earns her a FINAL warning|publisher=Daily Mail|accessdate=2007-07-23 | location=London | date=24 July 2007}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.thesun.co.uk/article/0,,2003230001-2007340117,00.html|title=More complaints over BB fight|publisher=The Sun newspaper|accessdate=2007-07-24|location=London}}</ref>

'''Accusations of homophobia'''

There were also complaints to Ofcom regarding [[Laura Williams]]<U+2019>s use of the word <U+201C>[[poof]]<U+201D>, and why it was not treated as seriously as the use of the word <U+201C>nigger<U+201D>.<ref>www.ofcom.org.uk/tv/obb/prog_cb/obb96/</ref> However, Laura was given a warning for the use of the word, which was broadcast as part of a highlights episode.

===''[[Big Brother 9 (UK)|Big Brother 9]]''===
'''Alexandra De Gale'''

Within the first week of the series, media watchdog [[Ofcom]] and Channel 4 had collectively received over 433<ref name=autogenerated1>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/7462662.stm BBC News: Alexandra thrown off Big Brother"]</ref> complaints about alleged bullying from housemate [[Alexandra De-Gale|Alexandra]], after an argument broke out between her and the other housemates regarding oven chips.<ref name="Big Brother faces new bullying claims">[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/celebritynews/2111116/Big-Brother-faces-new-bullying-claims.html Big Brother faces new bullying claims] "Telegraph" Retrieved 2008-06-13</ref> Channel 4 defended its housemate selection, claiming that the production team were closely watching the housemates as they normally do to ensure the safety of the housemates.<ref name="over 300 claims">[http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/bigbrother9/a99836/big-brother-sparks-500-complaints.html Big Brother sparks 500 complaints] ''DigitalSpy'' Retrieved 2008-06-14</ref> The broadcaster also noted that Alexandra had been warned that her behaviour could be deemed threatening.<ref name="over 300 claims"/> On Day 14 she was ejected from the house after apparently threatening to have housemates who nominated her for eviction dealt with by her "gangster friends".<ref name=autogenerated1 /><ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/7462935.stm Big Brother Alexandra transcript]</ref>

'''Bullying of Sara Folino'''

During week 12, [[Darnell Swallow]] and [[Rex Newmark]] both received warnings of unacceptable behaviour from Big Brother after they appeared to be bullying Sara Folino. This was after more than 1500 people complained to Ofcom about their alleged sexist behaviour.<ref>[http://www.brandrepublic.com/News/842094/Big-Brother-hit-1500-complaints-sexist-bullying/]</ref>

===''[[Big Brother 2009 (UK)|Big Brother 10]]''===
'''Marcus Akin'''

Sree Desari accused Marcus Akin of racially mocking his voice, Akin was reprimanded by Big Brother but fought his innocence, telling Big Brother that they have become too [[politically correct]], and pointing out that they would not tell him off if he imitated Charlie Drummond's [[geordie]] accent. Three weeks later Akin was reprimanded for threatening to punch Tom Oliver, however Tom was not present during this threat.

'''Kenneth Tong controversy'''

Kenneth Tong threatened to kill Bea Hammill after she refused to take part in a secret mission set for the new housemates, claiming that he 'sat across from some of the world's most dangerous men' he then made a gesture to imply that he could have her killed, however Hammill was not present at the time of this threat. Charlie Drummond, who was present at the time told Bea and she complained to Big Brother in the Diary Room and Tong was later given a warning. Viewers complained that he was only told off after housemates complained and that Big Brother should have punished him straight away, he quit the show after less than a week.

'''Bullying of Freddie Fisher''' 

Housemate Freddie Fisher (formerly named Halfwit) was continuously victimised and often scapegoated by his fellow housemates, with housemates Karly Ashworth, Kris Donnelly and Lisa Wallace, being labeled as 'bullies' by the public.<ref>http://www.marketdraytonadvertiser.com/2009/07/17/exclusive-big-brother-interview/</ref> Furthermore, Fisher was nominated for five consecutive evictions in the first five weeks of the show. The housemates eventually grew to accept him by the fifth week, and Donnelly and Ashworth were evicted in Week 5 and Week 6 respectively. 

Freddie then grew close to new housemate Bea Hammill who arrived on the night of Day 44, however Hammill later started to isolate and bully Freddie, allegedly giving him a [[panic attack]] in the bedroom, she continuously victimised him throughout Week 10 until he was evicted. Hamill herself was evicted a week later to a hostile reception.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/showbiz/big_brother/2583542/Freddie-Fisher-is-emotionally-terrorised-by-Bea-Hamill.html | location=London | work=The Sun | first=Mike | last=Hayes | title=Freddie is emotionally terrorised | date=12 August 2009}}</ref> On the final night they announced that they had made up.

===''[[Big Brother 2010 (UK)|Big Brother 11]]''===

'''John James Parton'''

In the early stages of the show's eleventh series contestant John James declared that he "''hates''" his fellow housemate Rachael White, adding that he hates "''girls that are arrogant purely because [of] what they look like.''" and that Rachael "''looks down on people.''<U+201D><ref>http://www.insidebigbrother.net/articles/john-james-i-hate-rachael.ibb</ref> John James confronted Rachael about their differences, claiming to have an issue with her facial expressions, which he interpreted as being arrogant.<ref>http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/bigbrother/news/a227926/rachael-thinks-john-james-is-hot.html</ref> White claimed that the conflict hurt her feelings<ref>http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/bigbrother/news/a228870/rachael-hurting-over-john-james-conflict.html</ref> and was concerned that John James left the room whenever she entered.<ref>http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/bigbrother/news/a228478/rachael-still-confused-by-john-james-spurn.html</ref> In a conversation during dinner, White, along with a number of other female contestants made comments about wishing to appear in ''Nuts'' magazine.<ref>http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/bigbrother/news/a228543/john-james-and-rachael-clash-at-dinner.html</ref> Following the conversation John James commented that they're "''not rock stars''" and began what the ''Mirror'' called a "foul-mouthed tirade" in protest to the discussion. White commented that she felt the protest was a "''personal attack''" on herself and was reduced to tears.<ref>http://www.mirror.co.uk/tv-entertainment/big-brother/2010/06/17/big-brother-11-john-james-launches-foul-mouthed-tirade-against-rachael-115875-22340024/</ref> In a later disagreement, John James said that the reason he took an instant dislike to her was because of a video tape of White which was aired on the opening night. He was described as "''shouting across the bedroom''" and again reduced White to tears.<ref>http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/bigbrother/news/a229116/john-james-and-rachael-feud-heats-up.html</ref>

===''[[Celebrity Big Brother 2010 (UK)|Celebrity Big Brother 2010]]''===

'''Disablism'''

During the January 29 broadcast of Big Brother's Big Mouth, Vinnie Jones accused Davina McCall of 'walking like a retard', McCall responded by laughing and Jones then mimed what he meant. Despite immediate protests by disability charities, individual disabled people and a Facebook campaign, Channel 4 initially responded "It is important that within the context and structure of the programme that participants have the right to express themselves without censure". It was not until 12 February that Channel 4 removed the incident from its on-demand service 4oD and issued an apology, blaming the failure on the 'tiredness' of production staff. Jones and McCall issued apologies via their respective publicists at around the same time. The tardiness of the response drew unfavourable comment from disability groups, particularly following Channel 4's action in the 2007 Celebrity Big Brother racism incident, where contestants were warned over their conduct.

===''[[Ultimate Big Brother]]''===

'''Coolio'''

During the show's run [[Coolio]] and [[Nadia Almada]] had a number of disputes apparently due to Coolio hiding Almada's belongings and imitating her.<ref>http://bigbrother.tellymix.co.uk/2010/housemates/18342-nadia-threatens-to-walk-out-after-huge-row-with-coolio.html</ref> It was announced on Day 4 that Coolio had left the Big Brother House by "mutual consent" with Big Brother.<ref>http://www.insidebigbrother.net/ultimate/articles/coolio-leaves-by-mutual-consent.ibb</ref> Following Almada's eviction from the show, the remaining housemates were heard to discuss [[transphobic]] remarks made by Coolio against Almada. Fellow contestant [[Brian Dowling]] was heard to say "[Coolio] said to her, 'We have to talk', about Nadia's history. He wanted to know if Nadia still had a penis. He asked the girls to put their hands up her skirt [to find out]. He referred to her as 'they'."<ref>http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/bigbrother/news/a272421/brian-ulrika-explain-coolio-situation.html</ref> Following Almada's eviction from the show she declined to appear on ''Big Brother'' spin off shows ''Big Brother's Big Mouth'' and ''Big Brother's Little Brother'' claiming that viewers were misled as to what happened. Almada stated that "Coolio targeted me on the first night and he wouldn<U+2019>t leave me alone. He kept asking about my gender status and he humiliated me over it. If it had been a racial slur they would have shown it but because it was against a transsexual they edited it out."<ref>http://www.insidebigbrother.net/ultimate/articles/nadia-distraught-over-ubb.ibb</ref>

<br>
'' '''Big Brother's Big Mouth''' ''

Further controversy regarding the treatment of [[Nadia Almada]] was created on the ''Big Brother's Big Mouth'' episode which aired on the same night as Almada's eviction from the Ultimate Big Brother House. At the beginning of the episode, presenter [[Davina McCall]] introduced comedian Jarred Christmas with the link "He has the charm of Coolio and the warmth of Ulrika Jonsson. And he has the boyish good looks of Nadia". This led to viewer complaints and prompted an apology from McCall, who said "Nadia has always been one of my favourite housemates of all time. But if I upset her or indeed anyone by the comment I made then I am horrified and offer my genuine apologies".<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/showbiz/big_brother/3126660/Davina-is-sorry-for-Nadia-joke.html | location=London | work=The Sun | first=Angharad | last=Llewellyn | title=Davina is sorry for Nadia joke | date=6 September 2010}}</ref> The line "And he has the boyish good looks of Nadia" was cut from the show when it was posted for viewing on [[4oD]].

==Violence in the House==
===''[[Big Brother 5 (UK)|Big Brother 5]]''===
'''Fight Night'''

On Day 20, commonly referred to as 'Fight Night', volatile ex-Housemates [[Big Brother 2004 (UK)#Emma|Emma Greenwood]] and [[Michelle Bass]] returned to the Big Brother house after a fake eviction. Some of the other Housemates were extremely displeased, and after a series of arguments, an aggressive brawl began, prompting on-set security guards being called into the house to calm the situation for the first - and only - time in the show's history.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/showbiz/big_brother/archive/series_5/article208394.ece | location=London | work=The Sun | first1=Emily | last1=Smith | first2=Sara | last2=Nathan | title=Blockbuster fight night | date=24 May 2007}}</ref>

Viewers of the show's live internet stream called the police to inform them of the violent activity, shortly before the live transmission was taken off the air, until the situation was rectified. [[Ofcom]] upheld 55 complaints from viewers, saying that the footage was "distressing to watch" and "exceeded the viewers' expectations".<ref>http://www.ofcom.org.uk/tv/obb/prog_cb/pcb_20/192078.pdf</ref>

===''[[Big Brother 9 (UK)|Big Brother 9]]''===
'''Fight Night 2'''

Early in the morning on Day 23 - often referred to as 'Fight Night 2' or 'Spitgate' - a major argument began when [[Rex Newmark]] smudged a piece of pizza on [[Jennifer Clark]]'s winning drawing of [[Stuart Pilkington]] from a task earlier in the week.<ref name="draw fight 1

Tension increased among the housemates, and as the arguments continued, [[Dennis McHugh]] appeared to spit in [[Mohamed Mohamed]]'s face. Dennis later claimed however that no spit had actually left his mouth and hit Mohamed.<ref name="draw fight 2">[http://www.insidebigbrother.net/bb9/live-feed-cut.ibb Live feed cut over clash] ''Inside Big Brother'' Retrieved 2008-06-26</ref> For the second time in the show's history, the live feed was cut, and Big Brother ordered housemates to separate themselves.<ref name="draw fight 2"/><ref name="draw fight 1"/> On Day 23, Dennis was ejected from the house due to his actions, which were deemed as unacceptable behaviour by Big Brother.

==Sex and nudity==
===''[[Teen Big Brother: The Experiment]]''===
On Day Six/Seven, Jade Dyer and Tommy Wright became the first Big Brother UK contestants to have [[Sexual intercourse|sex]] on the show in its history. According to ''[[The Independent]]'', this was the first real-life sexual act shown on British television (although nothing explicit was seen; the two were under bedcovers). This sparked controversy in the British media and comment on teenage [[safe sex]] education.<ref>http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/showbiz/article-7212477-details/Big+bother+over+TV+teen+sex/article.do</ref>

===''[[Big Brother 5 (UK)|Big Brother 5]]''===
[[Ofcom]] received four complaints regarding a scene where housemates [[Michelle Bass]] and Stuart Wilson appeared to have sex under a dining table. These complaints were not upheld, as "no nudity or actual sexual activity was broadcast".<ref>www.ofcom.org.uk/tv/obb/prog_cb/pcb_20/192078.pdf</ref>

===''[[Big Brother 6 (UK)|Big Brother 6]]''===
This series was heavily criticised for the amount of nudity shown on the show; after a midnight "romp" in the pool Housemate [[Big Brother 2005 (UK)#Makosi|Makosi]] claimed to have conceived [[Anthony Hutton|Anthony]]'s child and asked for a pregnancy test. In addition, Housemate [[Big Brother 2005 (UK)#Kinga|Kinga]] gained infamy after [[masturbating]] with a wine bottle in the garden.

==Inclusion of certain housemates==
===''[[Celebrity Big Brother 3 (UK)|Celebrity Big Brother 3]]''===
Another of [[Germaine Greer]]'s stated reasons for leaving this series, was that the introduction of [[Jackie Stallone]] to the house was unnecessarily cruel towards fellow housemate [[Brigitte Nielsen]]; Nielsen had famously had a difficult relationship with the mother of her ex-husband ([[Sylvester Stallone]]), and Greer felt that it was unacceptable to make them live together in the name of entertainment. Nielson however stated in her eviction interview that she felt the experience had been a positive one.

===''[[Celebrity Big Brother 4 (UK)|Celebrity Big Brother 4]]''===
[[Member of Parliament|MP]] [[George Galloway]] was criticised for entering the house, being accused of "arrogance and self-interest".<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/4587448.stm | work=BBC News | title=Big Brother Galloway criticised | date=6 January 2006 | accessdate=30 April 2010}}</ref> The family of [[Stuart Lubbock]] criticised the inclusion of entertainer [[Michael Barrymore]], after Lubbock's body was found in Barrymore's swimming pool.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/4584056.stm | work=BBC News | title=Galloway joins Big Brother house | date=6 January 2006 | accessdate=30 April 2010}}</ref> However, Barrymore received a warm reception from the crowd.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/4587602.stm | work=BBC News | title=Big Brother launch seen by 6.5m | date=6 January 2006}}</ref>

==Voting and unfairness==
===''Big Brother 7''===
'''Golden ticket competition'''

A contest allowing holders of golden tickets - found in [[Kit-Kat]] chocolate bars - to be invited to a television show where one of them, [[List of Big Brother 2006 housemates (UK)#Susie|Susie Verrico]], was chosen to enter the House by Aisleyne picking a ball out of a machine at random caused some controversy, with the [[Advertising Standards Authority (United Kingdom)|Advertising Standards Authority]] saying that the terms and conditions of the draw should have been made clearer in related advertisements, and that an independent adjudicator should have been present before and during the draw.<ref>"[http://www.itv.com/news/entertainment_3c26360018cbcc12d9c89259fbfc6132.html Big Brother contest slammed again]", ''ITV News''.

'''Return of evicted housemates''' 

The decision to allow previous evictees to become eligible to win the show was also criticised. [[Channel 4]] received 500 complaints from viewers about this matter and Media watchdog [[Ofcom]] confirmed that it had received over 1,000 complaints, and referred viewers to [[ICSTIS]].<ref>"[http://www.ofcom.org.uk/complain/progs/bb/ Concerns about voting for previously evicted housemates]", ''Ofcom''.

==Other controversies==
===''Celebrity Big Brother 4''===
Housemate [[Pete Burns]] claimed that his coat was made from gorilla skin; after viewers called in to [[Ofcom]], police removed the coat for testing. Ownership of products made from gorilla is illegal in the UK without a licence. Tests found the coat was in fact made of Colobus monkeys, another endangered species. As a result the case was passed to the Crown Prosecution Service who determined that the pelts used to make the coat were imported before 1975 (the year it became illegal to import Colobus fur) and as such did not press charges. This greatly upset animal rights campaigners, including fellow Housemate and then [[People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals|PETA]] spokeswoman [[Jodie Marsh]].

===''Big Brother 6''===
'''Aggression'''

On Day 14, Roberto Conte threw food over Maxwell Ward's head during an argument. 

On Day 35, Ward was reprimanded for throwing a glass of water over Kemal Shahin whilst he was in bed, this was after the two had an argument involving Saskia Howard Clarke.

Science was often seen as intimidating by his housemates.

'''Davina McCall'''

Following the final of Big Brother 6 media watchdog OFCOM received over 450 complaints from viewers about host [[Davina McCall]]. During the interview the live crowd chanted the words "off, off, off" and "liar, liar, liar" at contestant Makosi. Viewers complained that McCall did nothing to stop the crowd, and some complained that she encouraged it. OFCOM confirmed that they launched an investigation into the events.<ref>http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/entertainment/film_and_tv/s/169/169950_big_brother_6_ofcom_to_investigate_over_makosis_treatment.html</ref>

===''Big Brother 7''===
Further criticism arose when contestant [[Glyn Wise|Glyn]] was reprimanded for communicating in his first language, [[Welsh language|Welsh]], to housemate [[Imogen Thomas|Imogen]]. Big Brother deemed this a form of '[[code]]' and issued a warning to Glyn, who retorted "But Welsh is British". Following the incident, the [[Welsh Language Society]] complained to [[Channel 4]], [[Ofcom]] and [[S4C]]. Clearly, it was no longer a problem after this as Glyn and Imogen continued to converse in Welsh. Such discussions were broadcast with English subtitles.<ref>"[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/wales/4997698.stm Big Brother's warning over Welsh]", ''BBC''. URL last accessed on 2006-06-01.</ref>
