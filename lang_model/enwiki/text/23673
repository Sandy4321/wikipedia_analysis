'''Line of Departure''' is a military term used to denote the starting position for an attack on enemy positions.  During the Second World War, the term in use in the British, Canadian and American militaries was ''Start Line''.  ''Line of Departure'' (LD) was adopted some time after the Korean War.

Strictly speaking, the line of departure is that point at which the attacking element crosses from friendly-held ground into unsecured ground. This is not to be confused with an [[Assembly Area]](AA), which is the secure area in which the attacking force prepares for an attack. Once ready, the force leaves the assembly area, may conduct a [[passage of lines]], and crosses the line of departure.
