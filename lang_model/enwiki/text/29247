'''HMS ''Australia''''' was one of seven [[Orlando class cruiser|''Orlando''-class]] [[armoured cruiser]]s built for the [[Royal Navy]] in the mid-1880s. She was assigned to the Mediterranean Fleet in 1889 and remained there until 1893 when she returned home. The ship was assigned to the [[Coast Guard Squadron]] for the next decade before she was placed in [[Reserve fleet|reserve]] in 1903. Australia was sold for [[ship breaking|scrap]] in 1905. 

==Design and description==
''Australia'' had a [[length between perpendiculars]] of {{convert|300|ft|m|1}}, a [[beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|56|ft|m|1}} and a [[draft (ship)|draught]] of {{convert|24|ft|m|1}}. Designed to [[Displacement (ship)|displace]] {{convert|5040|LT|t}}, all of the ''Orlando''-class ships proved to be overweight and displaced approximately {{convert|5535|LT|t}}. The ship was powered by a pair of three-cylinder [[triple-expansion steam engine]]s, each driving one shaft, which were designed to produce a total of {{convert|8500|ihp|lk=in}} and a maximum speed of {{convert|18|kn|lk=in}} using steam provided by four [[boiler (steam generator)|boiler]]s with [[forced draught]]. During her sea trials, ''Australia'' reached {{convert|18.8|kn}}. The ship carried a maximum of {{convert|900|LT|t}} of coal which was designed to give her a range of {{convert|8000|nmi|lk=in}} at a speed of {{convert|10|kn}}. The ship's complement was 484 officers and enlisted men.<ref name=ck5>Chesneau & Kolesnik, p. 65</ref>

''Australia''{{'}}s main armament consisted of two [[List_of_British_ordnance_terms#BL|breech-loading]] (BL) [[BL 9.2 inch gun Mk III - VII|{{convert|9.2|in|mm|sing=on|sigfig=3}} Mk V guns]], one gun fore and aft of the superstructure on [[pivot gun|pivot mounts]]. Her secondary armament was ten [[BL 6 inch gun Mk III IV VI|BL {{convert|6|in|mm|sing=on|sigfig=3}} guns]], five on each [[broadside]]. Protection against torpedo boats was provided by six [[quick-firing gun|quick-firing (QF)]] [[QF 6-pounder Hotchkiss|6-pounder Hotchkiss]] guns and ten [[QF 3-pounder Hotchkiss]] guns, most of which were mounted on the main [[deck (ship)|deck]] in broadside positions. The ship was also armed with six 18-inch (457&nbsp;mm) [[torpedo tube]]s: four on the broadside above water and one each in the bow and stern below water.<ref name=ck5/>

The ship was protected by a [[waterline]] [[compound armour]] [[Belt armor|belt]] {{convert|10|in|0}} thick. It covered the middle {{convert|200|ft|m|1}} of the ship and was {{convert|5|ft|6|in|1}} high.<ref name=ck5/> Because the ship was overweight, the top of the armour belt was {{convert|2|ft}} below the waterline when she was fully loaded.<ref>Friedman, p. 146</ref> The ends of the armour belt were closed off by transverse [[bulkhead (partition)|bulkhead]]s {{convert|16|in|0}}. The lower deck was {{convert|2|-|3|in|0}} thick over the full length of the hull. The conning tower was protected by {{convert|12|in|0}} of armour.<ref name=ck5/>

==Construction and service==
''Australia'', named for the [[Australia (continent)|Australian continent]],<ref>Silverstone, p. 216</ref> was [[Keel|laid down]] on 21 April 1885 by [[Robert Napier (engineer)|Robert Napier & Sons]] at their shipyard in [[Govan]], [[Glasgow]]. The ship was [[Ship naming and launching|launched]] on 25 November 1886, and completed on 11 December 1888.<ref>Friedman, p. 342</ref> Shortly after [[Ship commissioning|commissioning]], she was assigned to the Mediterranean Fleet and remained there until 1893 when she participated in the Columbian Review held in [[New York City]] that year to commemorate the 400th anniversary of Columbus' discovery of the New World. Upon her return home, ''Australia'' became the coast [[guard ship]] for [[Southampton Water]] for the next decade.<ref name=f1>Friedman, p. 141</ref> She visited [[Germany]] and [[Denmark]] in September 1901, when she escorted the royal yacht [[HMY Osborne (1870)|HMY Osborne]] carrying [[Edward VII|King Edward VII]] from [[Hamburg]] to [[Elsinore]].<ref>{{Cite newspaper The Times |articlename=Royal gathering in Denmark - Arrival of the King|day_of_week=Monday |date=9 September 1901 |page_number=4 |issue=36555| }}</ref> The ship was placed in reserve at [[Chatham]] in 1903<ref name=f1/> before being sold for scrap on 4 April 1905.<ref name=ck5/>
