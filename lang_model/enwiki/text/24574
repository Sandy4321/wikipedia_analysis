Cambridge were coxed by Leigh Weiss while Oxford's cox was Alison Norrish &ndash; it was the first time in the history of the Boat Race that both crews had female coxes.<ref name=coxattack/>  Prior to the race, Oxford coach [[Patrick Sweeney (rower)|Pat Sweeney]] criticised Weiss: "Their cox is so useless she might hit us.  It's not her fault, but Cambridge should have chosen someone who knows the river."<ref name=coxattack>{{Cite news | title = Cambridge cox under attack | work = [[The Times]] | date = 25 March 1989 | first = Jim | last = Railton | page = 43 | issue = 63351}}</ref>  Weiss responded "I feel confident that I will make the decisions to make Cambridge win."<ref name=coxattack/>

The first [[Women's Boat Race]] took place in 1927, but did not become an annual fixture until the 1960s.  The race is conducted as part of the [[Henley Boat Races]], but in 2015 is slated to be held on the River Thames.<ref>{{Cite web | url = http://theboatrace.org/women/history | title = A brief history of the Women's Boat Race | publisher = The Boat Race Company Limited| accessdate = 5 July 2014}}</ref>  The reserve race, contested between Oxford's Isis boat and Cambridge's Goldie boat has been held since 1965.

Two minutes later Oxford had a clear water advantage and continued to pull away, holding a six-second lead at [[Hammersmith Bridge]].  The lead had extended slightly by the Chiswick Steps; Cambridge failed to make any ground on Oxford who swept under [[Barnes Railway Bridge|Barnes Bridge]] eight seconds ahead.  Oxford maintained the lead to pass the finish post two-and-a-half lengths clear.<ref name=ruin/>
