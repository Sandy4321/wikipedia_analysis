'''Hugo Stoltzenberg''' ([[1883]]-[[1974]]) was a [[German people|German]] [[chemist]] associated with the German government's clandestine chemical warfare activities in the early 1920s. 

Stoltzenberg was a close collaborator of [[List of Nobel laureates|Nobel Prize laureate]] [[Fritz Haber]], the father of German [[chemical warfare]]. They were both in connection with disposal of chemical warfare materials and the building of manufacturing plants in [[La Mara<U+00F1>osa]], near [[Madrid]], [[Spain]], the [[Soviet Union]] and [[Germany]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.scs.uiuc.edu/~mainzv/HIST/bulletin/bull99-2-num24-br4.php |title=Division of the History of Chemistry |accessdate=2007-04-12 |format= |work=[[American Chemical Society]] }}</ref> 

==World War I==
Stoltzenberg was the main protagonist at the [[Second Battle of Ypres]] ([[22 April]] to [[25 May]] [[1915]]) in [[Belgium]] where the Germans used [[poison gas]] for the first time on the [[Western Front]]. The first gas attack occurred against Canadian soldiers and also against a force of mostly colonial soldiers from French Africa known as [[Goumier]]s. The gas used was [[Chlorine gas]].  [[Mustard gas]], also called '''Yperite''' from the name of this city, was also used for the first time near Ypres in the autumn of 1917.

Prior to that, Stoltzenberg had injured his eye in an incident involving a chlorine gas cylinder which exploded and blind him in the left eye.<ref name="The Monitor">{{cite web |url=http://www.uga.edu/cits/documents/pdf/monitor/monitor_sp_1995.pdf |title=Hugo Stoltzenberg and Chemical Weapons Proliferation |accessdate=2007-04-12 |last=Garrett |first=Benjamin C. |authorlink= |coauthors= |date= |year=1995 |month= |format= |work=The Monitor Volume 1, Number 2 |publisher=University of Georgia |pages=11 |language=English |archiveurl= |archivedate= |quote= }}</ref>

==Interwar years==
After the end of [[World War I]], Stoltzenberg participated in clearing away the stockpiles of the chemical warfare agants in [[L<U+00FC>neburg Heath]] in [[Lower Saxony]], [[Germany]] between 1920 and 1925. Many of those agents were sold to the U.S. and Sweden while the rest were taken to "Chemische Fabrik Stoltzenberg", his own company in [[Hamburg]].<ref name="The Monitor"/>

==Involvement in the Rif War==

Stoltzenberg build a close relationship with the Spanish government. He signed a contract to fully assist the establishment of the [[La Mara<U+00F1>osa]] plant "Fabrica Nacional de Productos Quimicos" which served the Spanish army with [[chemical warfare agent]]s (including [[mustard gas]] bombs) used against the Riffian rebels in [[Spanish Morocco]] during the [[Rif War (1920)|Third Rif War]] between [[1923]] and [[1927]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Rudibert |first=Kunz |authorlink= |coauthors=Rolf-Dieter M<U+00FC>ller |editor= |others= |title=Giftgas Gegen Abd El Krim: Deutschland, Spanien und der Gaskrieg in Spanisch-marokko, 1922-1927 |origdate= |origyear= |origmonth= |url= |format= |accessdate= |accessyear= |accessmonth= |edition= |series= |date= |year=1990 |month= |publisher=Rombach |location= |language=German |isbn=3-7930-0196-2 |oclc= |doi= |id= |pages= |chapter= |chapterurl= |quote= }}</ref>  He later became a Spanish citizen<ref>{{cite book |last=Balfour |first=Sebastian |authorlink= |coauthors= |editor= |others= |title=Deadly Embrace: Morocco and the road to the Spanish Civil War |origdate= |origyear= |origmonth= |url= |format= |accessdate= |accessyear= |accessmonth= |edition= |series= |date= |year=2002 |month= |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |location= |language= |isbn=0-1992-5296-3 |oclc= |doi= |id= |pages=132 |chapter= |chapterurl= |quote= }}</ref> while being the chief engineer of the plant.<ref name="The Monitor"/>

==Other contracts==
In 1923, he signed his second contract. The Soviets wanted to modernize their chemical arsenal and asked Stoltzenberg to become a chief engineer replacing the [[chlorine gas]] plant at [[Saratov]] into a modern mustard gas plant. He will quit his collaboration efforts around 1928 heading to work at [[Ravinica]] plant in [[Yugoslavia]] before working in [[Brazil]] between 1937 and 1942.<ref name="The Monitor"/>

In his return to Germany he sat up a new laboratory producing <U+201C>timed-release hydrogen cyanide,<U+201D> which was patented in [[Great Britain]]. 

==Later years==
Stoltzenberg will join the [[Nazi party]] in the middle of [[World War II]]. He will continue his researches at his laboratory in Hamburg before selling it in 1969. He died in 1974.<ref name="The Monitor"/>
