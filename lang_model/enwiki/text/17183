'''Hal Fishman''' (August 25, 1931 <U+2013> August 7, 2007) was the longest-running [[news anchor]] in the history of  [[United States|American]] television,<ref>[http://www.ucla.edu/spotlight/archive/html_2002_2003/alum1002_fishman.html Hal Fishman, Newsman / UCLA Spotlight<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> having served on-air for [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]] television stations continuously between 1960 and his death in 2007.  He was also a record-holding [[aviator]].

==Biography==
A [[Brooklyn]] native, he received his Bachelor's degree from [[Cornell University]] where he worked at the campus radio station.  He also received a [[master's degree]] in [[political science]] from [[UCLA]] in 1956, and planned for a career in academia (he actually worked as an assistant political science professor at [[California State University, Los Angeles]] for two years). However, after [[KCOP]] Channel 13 approached him to teach an on-air course, the station invited him to anchor his own segment. Fishman had been on the air continuously since June 20, 1960, moving from [[KCOP]] to [[KTLA]] in 1965. That same year, Fishman had major exposure as a field reporter for KTLA when he helped cover the [[Watts Riots]] live from the [[Los Angeles Police Department]] command center. He had anchored KTLA's "News At Ten" since January 8, 1975. Prior to anchoring at KTLA, Fishman had worked at other [[Los Angeles]] independent stations [[KTTV]] and [[KCAL-TV|KHJ]] (now KCAL) during the early 1970s.

===Notable events covered===
As a news anchor, Fishman covered numerous events in Los Angeles and the world, ranging from the assassination of presidential candidate [[Robert F. Kennedy]], to the [[1971 San Fernando earthquake|Sylmar]] and [[Northridge earthquake]]s, to [[Pope John Paul II]]'s 1987 visit to [[Southern California]]. He, along with KTLA, was credited for being the first to air footage of the police beating of [[Rodney King]] in 1991, an event that sparked [[1992 Los Angeles riots|riots]] a year later when the officers were acquitted. In 2000, KTLA dedicated its newsroom in Fishman's honor, commemorating his 40 years in television and his years of service and commitment to the region.<ref name="ktla.trb.com">[http://ktla.trb.com/extras/ktla/hal/hal-lifecareer.html Hal Fishman 1931-2007 | Hal's Life And Career<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

===Honors===
Fishman had won numerous awards, including the Associated Press Television-Radio Association's first-ever Lifetime Achievement Award. He received a "star" on the Hollywood "Walk of Fame," and KTLA named its television news studio after Fishman. He also authored two novels, ''Flight 902 is Down'' (co-authored with aviation writer Barry J. Schiff) and ''The Vatican Target''. Hal was also an accomplished pilot and set 13 records for speed and altitude.<ref name="ktla.trb.com"/> In 1969, he was awarded the [[List of Louis Bl<U+00E9>riot medal winners|Louis Bl<U+00E9>riot medal]] by the [[F<U+00E9>d<U+00E9>ration A<U+00E9>ronautique Internationale]].

===Death===
Fishman died August 7, 2007 at home, just eighteen days before he would have turned 76, following recent treatment for a liver infection, which had detected cancer in his liver and colon. That morning the station interrupted its regular news schedule and dedicated much of the entire Morning Show and Prime News broadcasts to Fishman. The reporters on Prime News did not break for commercials that evening. Hal Fishman's last broadcast was on July 30, 8 days before his death.<ref>[http://ktla.trb.com KTLA The CW | Where Los Angeles Lives<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

The event was emceed by Morning Show anchor Michaela Pereira. During the gala, Hal spoke to the audience about his time in television. Fishman appeared somewhat fatigued but little would be known about his health until the day after.<ref>[http://ktla.trb.com/extras/ktla/60th/hal-gala.html Celebrating Hal Fishman | KTLA The CW | Celebrating 60 Years<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>
