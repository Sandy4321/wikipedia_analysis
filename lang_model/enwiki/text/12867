'''Gilbert Luis Centina III''' is a poet and a member of the religious [[Augustinians|Order of St. Augustine]]. He is one of the leading voices in contemporary Catholic poetry following in the footsteps of another Augustinian, the sixteenth-century poet [[Luis Ponce de Le<U+00F3>n|Fray Luis Ponce de Le<U+00F3>n]] that literary critics have crowned as the Prince of Spanish Lyric Poetry.

Centina belongs to the Augustinian Province of the Most Holy Name of Jesus of the Philippines and is under the circumscription of Madrid, seat of his province's government. He is currently assigned at the Augustinian-run parish of Holy Rosary in New York City.
<!-- (note: this is about the province and not about gilbert centina III) His province counts among its members the world-renowned navigator [http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15223a.htm Fray Andres de Urdaneta] who, along with four other Augustinian friars, guided the expedition of ''Adelantado'' [http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9047633?hook=272626 Miguel Lopez de Legazpi] from Mexico to the [http://www.cia.gov/cia/publications/factbook/geos/rp.html Philippines] in 1565. Tasked to establish the first permanent Spanish settlement in the islands, this voyage led to over three hundred years of Spanish rule in the Philippines which Legazpi and his expedition formed into a single nation from disparate native tribes. To provide a steady infusion of missionaries to the new Spanish colony, the Province was formed in 1573, and a seminary was established in [http://www.augnet.org/OrderStAugustineSECTION5/OrderHistory/OrderPlaces/Europe02/0329-Valladolid.html Valladolid], Spain to sustain the impetus achieved by the first Catholic missionaries in the Philippines that included Urdaneta, [http://www.augnet.org/OrderStAugustineSECTION5/OrderHistory/OsaPeople/OsaPeople%2002/2661-Rada.htm Fray Martin de Rada] and companion friars. -->

He is the author of two books of poetry ''Our Hidden Galaxette'' and ''Glass of Liquid Truths''. His work has been anthologized in high school and college textbooks in the Philippines. Besides [[English language|English]], he also writes in [[Spanish language|Spanish]] and in two Philippine languages, [[Hiligaynon]] and [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]]. 

From the [[Asian Catholic Publishers]] and the [[Archdiocese of Manila]], he received the Catholic Authors Award in 1996. He entered the Augustinian Convent in [[Intramuros]], [[Manila]] and obtained his degrees from the [[University of Santo Tomas]] (BA classical, PhB, STB, and STL, all ''cum laude'') and from the [[University of the Philippines]] (Master of Arts in comparative literature). He completed required units for his PhD in comparative literature from a state university in central Philippines but did not submit a thesis to be conferred the degree. Upon his ordination to the priesthood, he briefly served as a missionary in [[Peru]].
