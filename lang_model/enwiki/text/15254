Visitors to '''[[Serbia]]''' must obtain a [[visa (document)|visa]] from one of the [[List of diplomatic missions of Serbia|Serbian diplomatic missions]] unless they come from one of the visa exempt countries.

The Government of [[Serbia]], based on bilateral agreements or unilateral decisions, allows citizens of certain countries and territories to visit Serbia for tourism or business purposes without having to obtain a visa.<ref>{{cite web|title=Visa Information - Serbia|url=https://www.timaticweb.com/cgi-bin/tim_website_client.cgi?FullText=1&COUNTRY=RS&SECTION=VI&SUBSECTION=00&user=KLMB2C&subuser=KLMB2C|work=[[Timatic]]|publisher=[[IATA]]|accessdate=17 December 2013}}</ref> Citizens of other countries have to obtain a visa from the Embassy or Consulate General of the Republic of Serbia<ref name="mfa.gov.rs">[http://www.mfa.gov.rs/en/index.php?Itemid=152&option= ''Embassy or Consulate General of the Republic of Serbia abroad'']</ref> in the country of their principal residence.

Visa policy of Serbia is similar to the [[Visa policy of the Schengen Area]]. [[Serbia]] grants 90 day visa-free entry to all Schengen Annex II nationalities, except for [[Antigua and Barbuda]], [[Bahamas]], [[Barbados]], [[Brunei]], [[El Salvador]], [[Guatemala]], [[Honduras]], [[Malaysia]], [[Mauritius]], [[Moldova]], [[Nicaragua]], [[Paraguay]], [[Saint Kitts and Nevis]], [[Taiwan]] and [[Venezuela]]. It additionally grants a visa-free entry to other countries for 30 days <U+2013> [[Belarus]], [[Cuba]], [[Kazakhstan]], [[Russia]] and [[Ukraine]] and 90 days <U+2013> [[Bolivia]], [[Mongolia]], [[Tunisia]], [[Turkey]] and [[United Arab Emirates]].<ref>[http://www.mfa.gov.rs/to_serbia.doc MFA.gov.rs]</ref> Serbia also allows citizens of [[China]] to enter without a visa if their passport was designated with note "on business in Serbia" by the home authorities.

In June 2014, a plan was announced to allow visa-free entry to holders of Schengen, American or British visas and to sign further bilateral agreements on visa liberalization with important trading partners.<ref>[http://www.mfa.gov.rs/en/press-service/statements/13274-ministers-dacic-and-ljajic-on-visa-liberalization-as-an-incentive-for-investment- Ministers Dacic and Ljajic on visa liberalization as an incentive for investment]</ref>

[[File:Registration and cancellation of residence or registration of place change form.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Registration and cancellation of residence or registration of place change form]]
If foreign travelers stay at a hotel during their visit to Serbia, they are not required to register with the police, since the hotel they are staying at will complete the registration on their behalf.
When visiting friends or family and staying with them, all foreign visitors are required to register with the Aliens Department<ref>[http://www.mup.gov.rs/cms_lat/direkcija.nsf/odeljenje-za-strance.h] Odeljenje za Strance</ref> of the local [[Ministry of Internal Affairs (Serbia)|MUP]] in the place of the intended stay, within twenty-four hours of entering the country.<ref>[http://www.mup.gov.rs/domino/dokumenta.nsf/boravakstrancil] BORAVAK I NASTANJENJE STRANACA</ref> At the Department, they will fill in a form (a sort of a landing card) made of two parts (both parts should be filled in). The form is processed by the officer in charge and a stamped segment is returned to the applicant. Visitors should always have this certificate on them during the entire stay in the country together with their passport or the ID card, when applicable. Foreigners who, at the time of registering with the police, know the date of their departure from Serbia, should mention it to the officer processing their registration in order to avoid additional visit to the same police department for de-registration. The registration is free of charge. Upon passport / ID check at the port of exit, the certificate is collected by the immigration officer. Failing to complete the registration may result in fines.
