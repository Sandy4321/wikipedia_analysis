'''Avram Steuerman-Rodion''', born '''Adolf Steuerman''' or '''Steuermann''' and often referred to as just '''Rodion''' (November 30, 1872<U+2013>September 19, 1918), was a [[Romania]]n poet, anthologist, physician and [[Socialism|socialist]] journalist. A member of [[History of the Jews in Romania|Romania's Jewish community]], he was a lifelong militant for [[Jewish emancipation]] and [[Jewish assimilation|assimilation]], noted for poems which attack the prevailing [[antisemitism]] of his day. For a while, he was active as a propagandist of ''[[Hovevei Zion]]'' ideas among local Jews.

During the early stages [[World War I]], Rodion was a columnist at ''[[Seara (newspaper)|Seara]]'' daily, with articles which criticized Romania's prospects of joining the [[Allies of World War I|Entente Powers]]. Steuerman is himself described as a [[Germanophile]], but, upon Romania's entry into the war in 1916, earned distinction on the [[Romania in World War I|local front]]. He committed suicide upon [[demobilization]], following episodes of [[Major depressive disorder|clinical depression]]. 

Married into the family of Jewish intellectuals [[Moses Schwartzfeld|Moses]] and [[Elias Schwartzfeld]], Steuerman-Rodion was thus related to poet-philosopher [[Benjamin Fondane]], who was his literary pupil. Steuerman himself is often described as an obscure contributor to [[Literature of Romania|Romanian literature]], but survives in cultural memory for having given a poetic voice to the ideals of Jewish integration.

==Biography==
===Early life and career===
A native of [[Ia<U+015F>i]] city, the historical capital of [[Moldavia]] region, Steuerman enlisted at the [[University of Ia<U+015F>i]] Faculty of Medicine, and later furthered his medical studies in [[France]].<ref name="lb318">Boia, p.318</ref> Upon his return, he set up a medical practice in his native city.<ref name="lb318"/> The Jewish printing house of [[Laz<U+0103>r <U+015E>araga]] published Steuerman's selection of [[Romanian literature]], ''Autori rom<U+00E2>ni'' ("Romanian Authors"), divided into two undated volumes: the Anthology-proper and the [[Chrestomathy]].<ref>C<U+0103>linescu, p.555, 978</ref> Steuerman and <U+015E>araga published a second, dated, edition in 1896.<ref>{{ro icon}} Cornelia Pillat, [http://www.romlit.ro/voluptatea_lecturii "Voluptatea lecturii"], in ''[[Rom<U+00E2>nia Literar<U+0103>]]'', Nr. 35/1999</ref> His writing career was consecrated by several volumes of [[lyrical poetry]]<U+2014>''S<U+0103>r<U+0103>cie'' ("Poverty"), ''Lirice'' ("Lyricals"), ''Spini'' ("Thorns")<U+2014>, a volume of short stories<U+2014>''O toamn<U+0103> la Paris'' ("An Autumn in [[Paris]]")<U+2014>, a [[libretto]] for an opera about [[List of rulers of Moldavia|Moldavian Prince]] [[Petru Rare<U+015F>]], and several translations from foreign literature.<ref>{{ro icon}} [http://www.romanianjewish.org/db/pdf/nr302_303/pagina20.pdf "Calendar.

As a journalist, Avram Steuerman was primarily affiliated with the socialist press of Moldavia, and made his name writing for the [[left-wing]] paper ''[[Evenimentul]]''.<ref>{{ro icon}} [[Hary Kuller]], [http://www.romanianjewish.org/db/pdf/nr278_279/pagina19.pdf "Gazetari evrei <U+015F>i gazetele f<U+0103>cute de ei.

This short-lived gazette had a relatively obscure history, and one of its contributors, the maverick socialist [[Garabet Ibr<U+0103>ileanu]] reportedly forgot to mention it in all his later accounts of the period.<ref name="vdpseudo">{{ro icon}} Victor Durnea, [http://www.romlit.ro/pseudonimele_lui_g._ibrileanu_colaborator_la_noutatea_iai_1897 "Pseudonimele lui G.

A. Bassarabescu]], [[George Ranetti]] etc.<ref name="vdpseudo"/>

During the first decade of the 20th century, Rodion began a cordial correspondence with [[Ion Luca Caragiale]], the self-exiled Romanian playwright. Himself a noted proponent of Jewish emancipation and Jewish Romanian literature, Caragiale viewed Steuerman as one of his best Jewish friends, a group which also includes dramatist [[Ronetti Roman]], critic [[Constantin Dobrogeanu-Gherea]], journalists [[Barbu Br<U+0103>ni<U+015F>teanu]] and [[Emil Fagure]],<ref>{{ro icon}} [[Dan M<U+0103>nuc<U+0103>]], [http://convorbiri-literare.dntis.ro/MANUCAaug3.html "Scrisorile lui Caragiale"], in ''[[Convorbiri Literare]]'', August 2003</ref> as well as Steuerman's own publisher <U+015E>araga.<ref>{{ro icon}} Vasile Iancu, [http://convorbiri-literare.dntis.ro/IANCUnov.html "<U+00CE>nfa<U+0163>i<U+015F><U+0103>rile lui Caragiale <U+00EE>n Ia<U+015F>ii Junimii"], in ''[[Convorbiri Literare]]'', November 2002</ref> Around 1907, Caragiale publicly stated his admiration for Steuerman and Ronetti Roman. His words of praise irritated [[Nationalism|nationalist]] historian [[Nicolae Iorga]], who published the [[Antisemitism|antisemitic]] review ''[[Neamul Rom<U+00E2>nesc]]'': in one of his articles for that magazine, Iorga reported that Caragiale was a sellout to Jewish interests.<ref>Voicu, p.148</ref> Caragiale indirectly reacted to this accusation in 1908, when he satirized Iorga's scholarly ambitions with a mordant [[epigram]] that was first published in ''[[Convorbiri Literare]]''.<ref>Voicu, p.148-149</ref> 

Rodion was also a literary chronicler at ''Ordinea'' ("The Order"), published by the [[Conservative-Democratic Party]], and held a similar position at [[Alexandru B<U+0103>d<U+0103>r<U+0103>u]]'s ''Opinia'' ("The Opinion"). Both magazines notably published his introductions to the work of [[England|English]] poet [[Oscar Wilde]].<ref>[http://www.oscholars.com/TO/Appendix/Bibliographies/romanian1.htm ''Oscar Wilde: A Romanian Bibliograhy of Secondary Sources''], at [http://www.oscholars.com/ ''The Oscholars'' network]; retrieved February 22, 2011</ref> His activity at ''Ordinea'' enjoyed reputation outside Moldavia: in [[Transylvania]], critic [[Ilarie Chendi]] noted that, with [[Dumitru Karnabatt]] and some others, the "fecund" Steuerman was still maintaining alive the tradition of cultural journalism.<ref>{{ro icon}} [[Ilarie Chendi]], [http://documente.bcucluj.ro/web/bibdigit/periodice/luceafarul/1912/BCUCLUJ_FP_280091_1912_011_003.pdf "Viea<U+0163>a literar<U+0103> <U+00EE>n 1911 (o privire general<U+0103>)"], in ''[[Luceaf<U+0103>rul (magazine)|Luceaf<U+0103>rul]]'', Nr. 3/1912, p.61 (digitized by the [[Babe<U+015F>-Bolyai University]] [http://documente.bcucluj.ro/ Transsylvanica Online Library])</ref> At around the same time, Rodion had become a sympathizer of [[Josef B. Brociner]] and his Society of Romanian [[Israelites]]<U+2014>a local branch of ''[[Hovevei Zion]]'' and one of Romania's first [[Jewish political movements|Jewish political associations]].<ref>{{ro icon}} [http://www.romanianjewish.org/db/pdf/nr241/pagina10.pdf "Joseph Brociner <U+2013> un str<U+0103>lucit lider al evreilor rom<U+00E2>ni"], in ''[[Realitatea Evreiasc<U+0103>]]'', Nr. 241 (1041), November-December 2005, p.10</ref>

Steuerman befriended the much younger Benjamin Fondane (born ''Benjamin Wechsler'' in 1898), to whom he was known as ''b<U+0103>di'' ("uncle") Adolf or Adolphe.<ref>Daniel, p.602. See also Cr<U+0103>ciun, p.147</ref> Their camaraderie and kinship (Fondane was Moses Schwartzfeld's nephew) doubled as literary training: around 1912, when Fondane was aged 13, Steuerman reviewed his debut verse and encouraged him to continue.<ref>Daniel, p.602</ref> Reportedly, Rodion also helped introduce his relative to the socialist circles of Ia<U+015F>i.<ref>Cr<U+0103>ciun, p.147</ref>

===World War I and suicide===
During the first stage of [[World War I]], when the [[Kingdom of Romania]] maintained its neutrality, Rodion grew close to the political circles comprising [[Germanophile]]s, neutralist socialists or [[Pacifism|pacifists]]. Like his colleagues there, Rodion was not a keep supporter of the option to make Romania part of the [[Allies of World War I|Entente camp]]; he looked with more sympathy toward the [[German Empire]] and the [[Central Powers]].<ref name="lb318"/> In June 1915, Avram Steuerman was assigned a regular column in ''[[Seara (newspaper)|Seara]]'', a Bucharest newspaper founded by Germanophile agitator [[Alexandru Bogdan-Pite<U+015F>ti]] and purchased from him by a German cartel. The ''Seara'' pieces, which he signed as Rodion and collectively titled ''Scrisori din Ia<U+015F>i'' ("Letters from Ia<U+015F>i"), sought to depict the Moldavian state of affairs in lively colors, with noted stress on the spread of Germanophile sentiment.<ref name="lb318"/> They notably covered the conflicts between the academics of Bucharest and Ia<U+015F>i, in particular the largely unsuccessful attempt of [[University of Bucharest]] envoys to attract Ia<U+015F>i University staff into a national pro-Entente organization. The project was opposed by the Germanophile group of former socialist [[Constantin Stere]] and rendered ineffectual when Stere's own rival, Rector [[Matei Cantacuzino]], also advised against it.<ref>Boia, p.120</ref>

Drafted into the [[Romanian Land Forces]] as a [[Military medicine|military physician]], Rodion saw action throughout the [[Romania in World War I|Romanian Campaign]], retreating with the army into Moldavia after Bucharest fell to the Germans. His activity in the besieged province is said to have been exemplary throughout the period;<ref name="lb318"/> in 1917, Rodion had reached the rank of [[Major]].<ref>Daniel, p.596</ref> In May 1917, he was stationed in the village of [[C<U+0103>iu<U+0163>i]], where he read in ''Opinia'' that Fondane's father Isac Wechsler had died. In a letter of condolence he addressed to the Wechslers, Rodion stated: "here [...] death stalks us with every step and makes us love life."<ref>Daniel, p.596-597</ref>

After Romania signed a [[Treaty of Bucharest (1918)|separate peace]] with the Central Powers, and following the [[demobilization]] of summer 1918, Steuerman returned to Ia<U+015F>i. Back into civilian life, Rodion was, like [[George Top<U+00EE>rceanu]], one of the combatants whom the war years had rendered even more critical of the Ententist option; from Moldavia, he sent his texts to be published in Stere's explicitly Germanophile review, ''Lumina'', and, at the same time, began contributing to ''Scena'', the daily owned by [[conscientious objector]] [[A. de Herz]].<ref>Boia, p.105, 318</ref> ''Lumina'' hosted a second series of his ''Scrisori'', beginning in June 1918.<ref name="lb318"/> During the same month, Rodion was also a correspondent of the short-lived leftist tribune ''Umanitatea'', launched in Ia<U+015F>i by the [[Bessarabia]]n Germanophile [[Alexis Nour]], and noted for its advocacy of total Jewish emancipation.<ref>Boia, p.260</ref> On July 27, ''Opinia'' published Steuerman's eulogistic commentary on the political essays of Stere's follower [[Dumitru D. P<U+0103>tr<U+0103><U+015F>canu]]; P<U+0103>tr<U+0103><U+015F>canu's text, grouped under the headline ''Vinova<U+0163>ii'' ("The Guilty Ones"), constituted an indictment of both the Entente and the [[National Liberal Party (Romania)|National Liberal Party]], Romania's main Ententist group.<ref>Boia, p.267-270, 290, 318</ref>

Avram Steuerman-Rodion was haunted by memories of the war, and, according to historian [[Lucian Boia]], suffered episodes of [[Major depressive disorder|clinical depression]] which he both concealed and left untreated.<ref name="lb318"/> He eventually committed suicide in Ia<U+015F>i, the news of which reputedly shocked his colleagues and friends in the political-literary community.<ref name="lb318"/> Homages and obituary pieces were printed in various Romanian press venues, including ''Lumina'', ''Scena'' and ''Opinia''<U+2014>the latter also featured a special commemorative piece by future novelist [[Cezar Petrescu]], ''La morm<U+00E2>ntul unui confrante'' ("At the Tomb of a Brother in Arms", September 26, 1918).<ref name="lb318"/> A year later, in his columns for ''Scena'' daily and the [[Zionism|Zionist]] paper ''[[M<U+00E2>ntuirea]]'', Fondane paid homage to his deceased uncle. These texts linked Rodion's death to desperation over the surge of antisemitism, chronic [[insomnia]], and [[gerontophobia]].<ref name="zoiudaism">{{ro icon}} [[Z. Ornea]], [http://www.romlit.ro/iudaismul_n_eseistica_lui_fundoianu "Iudaismul <U+00EE>n eseistica lui Fundoianu"], in ''[[Rom<U+00E2>nia Literar<U+0103>]]'', Nr. 48/1999</ref>

==Literary contributions==
According to literary historian [[Zigu Ornea]], Rodion, a "minor poet",<ref name="zoiudaism"/> was one of the young writers and activists instrumental in supporting the Romanian socialist patriarch [[Constantin Dobrogeanu-Gherea]], who was at the time caught in an ideological dispute with the dominant [[Conservatism|conservative]] group ''[[Junimea]]''. The other figures listed by Ornea in this context are Stere, Ibr<U+0103>ileanu, [[Dimitrie Anghel]], [[Anton Bacalba<U+015F>a]], [[Traian Demetrescu]], [[Emil Fagure]], [[Raicu Ionescu-Rion]], [[Sofia N<U+0103>dejde]] and [[Henri Sanielevici]].<ref>[[Z. Ornea]], ''Junimea <U+015F>i junimismul'', Vol. II, [[Editura Minerva]], Bucharest, 1998, p.357-358. ISBN 973-21-0562-3</ref> In his earlier ''Istoria literaturii rom<U+00E2>ne'' synthesis, the influential literary critic [[George C<U+0103>linescu]] chose to discuss Rodion and Berman Goldner-Giordano together, as two minor representatives of Dobrogeanu-Gherea's "[[Didacticism|tendentious art]]".<ref name="gc555">C<U+0103>linescu, p.555</ref>

Steuerman-Rodion left literary works which bridged socialist tendentiousness with his own cultural priority, [[Jewish assimilation]]. One of his poems reflected his dual identity, rendered dichotomous by the spread of [[antisemitism]]:

According to Fondane: "Rodion wanted to live. That is a habit people tend to have, and Rodion wanted life, the same as a leaf of grass or the bird of flight. The son of a people with [[Payot|sideburns]] and [[Kittel|robes]], that survives by assimilation with earthworms, with stones, with mankind, with plots of land, his force has bumped [...], like a fly, upon the wall of the world..."<ref name="zoiudaism"/> Fondane noted that Rodion, with his "painfully Romanian style of writing" at a time when Zionism was still "vague", could only opt in favor of erasing his own Jewish identity.<ref name="zoiudaism"/> Steuerman's Romanian [[patriotism]], frustrated by the antisemitic establishment, led him to write what are arguably his most-quoted lyrics:

Rodion's verses were described as particularly eloquent in depicting the misfortune of Jewish intellectuals who sought integration into Romanian society but were still rejected<U+2014>the piece is called "agonizing" by Zigu Ornea,<ref name="zoiudaism"/> and "immortal" by poet-essayist [[Radu Cosa<U+015F>u]].<ref name="rcjurnalul">{{ro icon}} [[Radu Cosa<U+015F>u]], [http://www.dilemaveche.ro/sectiune/la-centru-si-la-margine/articol/acum-10-ani-jurnalul "Acum 10 ani, ''Jurnalul''], in ''[[Dilema Veche]]'', Nr. 154, January 2007</ref> However, Romanian and [[Israel]]i academic [[Michael Shafir]] noted that, with similar texts by [[Ronetti Roman]], Steuerman-Rodion's poem mostly reflected the disbelief with which Jewish intellectuals were reacting to the late 19th century antisemitic barrage; according to Shafir, this reaction was undignified "lament": "Steuerman-Rodion [...] sounds like a lover rejected by his woman than a counter-combatant of the socialist persuasion".<ref name="msronetti"/>

Writing in 2010, [[Lucian Boia]] noted that Rodion's ''Scrisori din Ia<U+015F>i'' were "a veritable chronicle", "minutely researched and written with talent".<ref name="lb318"/> Boia found the overall Germanophile bias of ''Scrisori'' to be palatable: "the impression they leave is that Ia<U+015F>i was sharing in only too little measure the 'Ententist' pathos of Bucharest; an exaggeration of sorts, but also a fair amount of truth."<ref name="lb318"/> 

==Legacy==
According to the overall verdict of George C<U+0103>linescu, Rodion and Giordano were "insignificant" contributors to [[Romanian literature]], exclusively preoccupied with "the [[Semitic]] drama".<ref name="gc555"/> Michael Shafir also referred to Rodion as "(justly) forgotten",<ref name="msronetti"/> and Cosa<U+015F>u called him "obscure".<ref name="rcjurnalul"/> One to be influenced by Rodion was his own nephew Fondane: according to Ornea, it was Rodion and poet [[Jacob Gropper]] who first got Fondane interested in [[Judaism]] as a distinct literary subject.<ref name="zoiudaism"/> Fondane is also believed to have chosen the title of his column in the Zionist journal ''[[Lumea Evree]]'', ''Idei <U+015F>i oameni'' ("Ideas and People"), as a quote from and homage to Steuerman.<ref>Cr<U+0103>ciun, p.151</ref> In 1919, the same magazine hosted a [[Philo-Semitism|philosemitic]] essay by Romanian cultural promoter [[Gala Galaction]], which deplored the marginalization or persecution of Jewish writers, from [[Barbu Nem<U+0163>eanu]] to Rodion.<ref name="gvipostaze">{{ro icon}} [[George Voicu]], [http://193.226.7.140/~leonardo/n06/Voicu1.htm#_edn47 "Antisemitismul literar rom<U+00E2>nesc: ipostaze istorico-ideologice"], in [http://193.226.7.140/~leonardo/ ''E-Leonardo''], Nr. 6; retrieved February 9, 2011</ref>

Rodion's political case resurfaced during polemics launched by the Romanian antisemites and the antisemitic [[Fascism|fascists]], down to the end of [[World War II]]. Poet and [[Prime Minister of Romania|Premier]] [[Octavian Goga]] outlined his self-declared hatred for the Jews and call for discriminatory policies in his political tracts, but, unusually in this context, stated that he held no such grudge against either Rodion or Ronetti Roman.<ref name="gvipostaze"/> According to Radu Cosa<U+015F>u, Rodion's failure to integrate announced the similar drama of 1930s Jewish writer [[Mihail Sebastian]], who wanted to be perceived as Romanian but was in return vilified by the [[far right]].<ref name="rcjurnalul"/> In 1941, the [[authoritarianism|authoritarian]] regime of [[Ion Antonescu]] published a directory of Jewish Romanian authors, living or deceased, whose work was officially banned: Steuerman was included, under the erroneous spelling ''Steverman''.<ref>Rotman, p.174-175</ref> Although negative in substance, the brief profile published in George C<U+0103>linescu ''Istoria...'' (first edition 1941), alongside other portraits of Jewish literary men and women, is sometimes referred to as an act of defiance to Antonescu's cultural pronouncements.<ref>Rotman, p.175-177</ref> The goal of recovering Steuerman's contribution was consciously taken up by Jewish scholar and [[Anarchism|anarchist]] [[Eugen Relgis]], who wrote about him in one of his own literary essays.<ref>{{ro icon}} [[Leon Volovici]], [http://www.romanianjewish.org/db/pdf/nr306_307/pagina11.pdf "Prolog la suplimentul 'Eugen Relgis'.
