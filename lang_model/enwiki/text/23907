==Etymology==
The Old Norse word ''galdr'' is derived from a word for singing incantations, ''gala'' ([[Old High German]] and Old English: ''galan'') with an [[Indo-European]] -''tro'' suffix. In Old High German the -''stro'' suffix produced ''galster'' instead.<ref name="hell">[http://runeberg.org/svetym/0265.html Hellquist, E. (1922). Svensk etymologisk ordbok. C. W. K. Gleerups f<U+00F6>rlag, Lund. p. 177]</ref>

The [[Old English language|Old English]] forms were ''[[Wikt:gealdor#Old English|gealdor]]'', ''[[Wikt:galdor#Old English|galdor]]'', ''<U+021D>aldre'' "spell, enchantment, witchcraft", and the verb ''galan'' meant "sing, chant". It is contained in ''[[nightingale]]'' (from ''n<U+00E6>cti-gal<U+00E6>''), related to ''giellan'', the verb ancestral to Modern English ''yell'';  cf. also the Icelandic verb ''a<U+00F0> gala'' "to sing, call out, yell". In [[Dutch language]] ''gillen''.

The German forms were [[Old High German language|Old High German]] ''galstar'' and [[Middle High German|MHG]] ''galster'' "song, enchantment" ([[Konrad von Ammenhausen]] ''Schachzabelbuch''  167b), surviving in (obsolete or dialectal) Modern German ''Galsterei'' (witchcraft) and ''Galsterweib'' (witch).

==Practice==
The incantations were composed in a special meter named ''galdralag''.<ref name="steins"/> This meter was similar to the six-lined [[lj<U+00F3><U+00F0>ah<U+00E1>ttr]] but adds a seventh line.<ref name="galdralag">The article ''Galdralag'' in ''[[Nationalencyklopedin]]'' (1992)</ref> Another characteristic is a performed parallelism,<ref name="galdralag"/> see the stanza from ''[[Skirnism<U+00E1>l]]'', below.

A practical galdr for women was one that made childbirth easier,<ref name="steins">Steinsland, G. & Meulengracht S<U+00F8>rensen 1998:72</ref> but they were also notably used for bringing madness onto another person, whence modern [[Swedish language|Swedish]] ''galen'' meaning "mad".<ref name="myt"/> Moreover, a master of the craft was also said to be able to raise storms, make distant ships sink, make swords blunt, make armour soft and decide victory or defeat in battles.<ref name="myt"/> Examples of this can be found in ''[[Gr<U+00F3>galdr]]'' and in ''[[Frithiof's Saga]]''.<ref name="myt"/> In ''[[Gr<U+00F3>galdr]]'', [[Gr<U+00F3>a]] chants nine (a significant [[Numbers in Norse mythology|number in Norse mythology]]) galdrs to aid her son, and in ''[[Buslub<U+0153>n]]'', the schemes of king Ring of [[<U+00D6>sterg<U+00F6>tland]] are averted.<ref name="nordisk">The article ''[http://runeberg.org/nfbi/0309.html galder]'' in ''[[Nordisk familjebok]]'' (1908).</ref>

It is also mentioned in several of the poems in the ''[[Poetic Edda]]'', and for instance in ''[[H<U+00E1>vam<U+00E1>l]]'', where [[Odin]] claims to know [[Numbers in Norse mythology|18]] galdrs.<ref name="galder"/> For instance, [[Odin]] mastered galdrs against fire, sword edges, arrows, fetters and storms, and he could conjure up the dead and speak to them.<ref>Sch<U+00F6>n 2004:86</ref> There are other references in ''[[Sk<U+00ED>rnism<U+00E1>l]]'',<ref name="galder"/> where [[Skirnir]] uses galdrs to force [[Ger<U+00F0>r]] to marry [[Freyr]]<ref name="nordisk"/> as exemplified by the following stanza:

A notable reference to the use of galdrs is the eddic poem ''[[Oddr<U+00FA>nargr<U+00E1>tr]]'', where Borgny could not give birth before Oddr<U+00FA>n had chanted "biting galdrs"<ref name="steins"/> (but they are translated as ''potent charms'', by [[Henry Adams Bellows]] below):
