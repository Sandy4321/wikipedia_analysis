The so-called '''''Mars of Todi''''' is a near life-sized [[bronze sculpture|bronze]] warrior, dating from the late 5th or early 4th century BC, produced in [[Etruria]] for the [[Umbria]]n market. It was found at [[Todi]] (ancient Tuder), on the slope of Mount Santo.<ref>Fred S. Kleiner, introduction to ''A History of Roman Art'' (Wadsworth, 2007, 2010 "enhanced edition"), p. xl.</ref>

The bronze warrior was an expensive [[votum|votive offering]] made at a religious sanctuary,<ref>Guy Bradley, ''Ancient Umbria: State, Culture, and Identity in Central Italy from the Iron Age to the Augustan Era'' (Oxford University Press, 2000), p. 92.</ref> possibly to [[Laran]], the Etruscan god of war.<ref>Jean-Ren<U+00E9> Jannot, ''Religion in Ancient Etruria'', translated by Jane K. Whitehead (University of Wisconsin Press, 2005), p. 165.</ref> It had been buried in antiquity, perhaps ritually,<ref>Jannot, ''Religion in Ancient Etruria'', p. 136.</ref> and left undisturbed until its discovery in 1835.<ref>Bradley, ''Ancient Umbria'', p. 72.</ref> It is an example of the highest-quality "prestige" works from Etruria found in Umbria during this period,<ref>Bradley, ''Ancient Umbria'', pp. 68, 71<U+2013>72, 200.</ref> and probably came from a workshop in [[Orvieto]] (Etruscan Velzna, Roman [[Volsinii]]).<ref>Jannot, ''Religion in Ancient Etruria'', p. 165; Kleiner, ''A History of Roman Art'', p. xl.</ref> Velzna was known for its bronze sculptures, more than 2,000 of which were [[Roman-Etruscan Wars|looted by the Romans]] in 265 BC.<ref>Kleiner, ''A History of Roman Art'', p. xl.</ref>

The work is a "typical military figure" with "conspicuously Etruscan" facial features.<ref>Donald Strong and J.M.C. Toynbee, ''Roman Art'' (Yale University Press, 1976, 1988), pp. 32<U+2013>33.</ref> It is an Etruscan realization of [[Classical art|Greek formal Classicism]], and makes use of the [[contrapposto]] posture.<ref>Kleiner, ''A History of Roman Art'', p. xl; [[Otto Brendel]], ''Etruscan Art'' (Yale University Press, 1995, originally published 1978), pp. 316<U+2013>317</ref> The figure probably held a ''[[patera]]'' (libation bowl) in his extended right hand, and a spear in the left.<ref>Erika Simon, "Gods in Harmony: The Etruscan Pantheon," in ''The Religion of the Etruscans'' (University of Texas Press, 2006), p. 55; Kleiner, ''A History of Roman Art'', p. xl.</ref> His helmet is missing,<ref>Kleiner, ''A History of Roman Art'', p. xl.</ref> but his intricate body armor, depicted with "pedantic accuracy,"<ref>Brendel, ''Etruscan Art'', p. 317.</ref> is one of the best examples showing what plate armor from the period looked like.<ref>Graham Webster, ''The Roman Imperial Army of the First and Second Centuries A.D.'' (University of Oklahoma Press, 1979, 1998  3rd ed.), p. 2.</ref>

The dedication is inscribed on the skirt of the breastplate.<ref>Amanda Claridge, ''Rome: An Oxford Archaeological Guide'' (Oxford University Press, 1998), p. 393.</ref> It is written in [[Umbrian language|Umbrian]] in [[Etruscan alphabet|Etruscan characters]]<ref>Jannot, ''Religion in Ancient Etruria'', p. 136.</ref> and marks the beginning of the epigraphic tradition in this part of Umbria.<ref>Bradley, ''Ancient Umbria'', p. 73, note 127; Claridge, ''Rome,'' p. 393.</ref> The man dedicating it, however, has a name that is [[Celtic languages|Celtic]] in origin, an indication of Tuder's "cosmopolitian" character in the [[Archaic period]].<ref>Bradley, ''Ancient Umbria'', pp. 71<U+2013>72.</ref> The inscription reads ''Ahal Trutitis dunum dede'', "Ahal Trutitis gave [this as a] gift".<ref>Claridge, ''Rome,'' p. 393; Guiliano Bonfante and [[Larissa Bonfante]], ''The Etruscan Language: An Introduction'' (Manchester University Press, 1983, 2002 rev.ed.), p. 26.</ref>

The sculpture is currently held by the Museo Etrusco Gregoriano of the [[Vatican Museums|Vatican]].
