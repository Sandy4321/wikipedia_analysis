==Tournament==
[[File:Sinan Erdem Spor Salonu.jpg|200px|thumb|left|[[Sinan Erdem Dome]] hosted the WTA Championships for the first time in 2011.]] The 2011 WTA Championships took place at the Sinan Erdem Dome 25<U+2013>30 October 2011. It was the 41st edition of the event. The tournament was jointly run by the [[Women's Tennis Association]] (WTA) and was part of the [[2011 WTA Tour]]. It was the larger of the two season ending championships on the [[2011 WTA Tour]], the smaller being the [[2011 Commonwealth Bank Tournament of Champions|Tournament of Champions]] the following week. The latter is only for players who did not qualify for the WTA Championships.

===Format===
The singles event featured eight players and began as a round robin event, with four players in each of two groups called the Red Group and the White Group. Over the first four days of competition, each player met the other three players in their group, with the top two in each group advancing to the semifinals. The first-placed player in one group met the second-placed player in the other group, and vice versa. The winners of each semifinal met in the championship match.

The doubles competition had four teams playing in a straight knockout format from the semifinal stage.

====Round Robin tie-breaking methods====
The final standings of each group shall be determined by the first of the following methods that apply:
# Greatest number of wins
# Greatest number of matches played; or
# Head-to-head results if only two players are tied, or if three players are tied then:
::a. If three players each have the same number of wins, a player having played less than all three matches is automatically eliminated and the player advancing to the single elimination competition is the winner of the match-up of the two remaining tied players; or
::b. Highest percentage of sets won; or
::c. Highest percentage of games won

==Turkey Earthquake 2011==
WTA players and TEB BNP Paribas, the title sponsor of the TEB BNP Paribas WTA Championships, made a joint donation of US$250,000 to the Turkish Red Crescent to support the victims of the recent devastating earthquake in Turkey.

Close to 600 people died and more than 2,300 were injured during the country's most powerful earthquake in more than a decade. WTA stars participating in the TEB BNP Paribas WTA Championships donated a percentage of their Championships prize money, which was matched by both the WTA and TEB BNP Paribas.

The Turkish Red Crescent is Turkey's arm of the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement, the world's largest humanitarian network. Turkish Red Crescent took immediate action after the earthquake, mobilizing its staff and emergency supplies for thousands of victims.

===Round Robin===

====Day 1====
The action in this year's Tour Championships began with the Red Group with Wimbledon champion [[Petra Kvitov<U+00E1>]] and 2008 finalist [[Vera Zvonareva]]. Having lost to Zvonareva in straight sets just a few weeks ago in Tokyo, Kvitov<U+00E1> had her work cut out for her, but this time it was different - Kvitov<U+00E1> hadn't lost an indoor match all year and her huge serve, powerful groundstrokes and strong net play were working like a charm as she raced out to a 6<U+2013>2, 4<U+2013>1 lead. Things got tougher as the unforced errors began to creep into Kvitov<U+00E1>'s game, and Zvonareva closed the gap to 4<U+2013>all in the second set; but the No.3-seeded Kvitov<U+00E1> broke again for 5<U+2013>4 and served it out, getting two errors in a row from the No.6-seeded Zvonareva to get to match point then knifing a forehand volley. The series between the two is now knotted at 3<U+2013>3. Kvitov<U+00E1> ended with an even differential, 24 winners to 24 errors; she won 17 of 23 net points (including match point). Zvonareva was <U+2212>9 (eight winners, 17 errors).<ref>{{cite web |work=Sony Ericsson Championship Website |title=Petra Holds On For Victory Versus Vera|url=http://www.wtachampionships.com/page/LatestNews/Read/0,,12910~2493903,00.html|date=2011-10-26|deadurl=no}}</ref>

They were followed by last years finalist [[Caroline Wozniacki]] and first time qualifier [[Agnieszka Radwa<U+0144>ska]]. Wozniacki had her chances in the first set, rallying from 2<U+2013>4 to 5<U+2013>4 and holding triple set point with Radwa<U+0144>ska falling into a 0<U+2013>40 hole in the next game; Radwa<U+0144>ska snuck that game out and took the first set, Radwa<U+0144>ska then started to be bothered by her shoulder injury and started to go for her shots but Wozniacki wouldn't lose her cool, comfortably taking the second set and holding steady from 4<U+2013>all in the third to close the door on the two-hour, 39-minute marathon.<ref>{{cite web |work=Sony Ericsson Championship Website |title=Thrilling Triumph For Wozniacki Over Radwanska|url=http://www.wtachampionships.com/page/LatestNews/Read/0,,12910~2494107,00.html|date=2011-10-26|deadurl=no}}</ref>

The last match saw two US champions the 2006 champion [[Maria Sharapova]] and the current champion [[Samantha Stosur]]. Stosur, the No.7 seed at the year-end finale, turned the tables on one of the most lopsided head-to-heads in the upper echelon of the women's game, coming out like a house on fire then surviving some tense moments to close out a No.2-ranked, No.2-seeded Sharapova in straight sets 6<U+2013>1, 7<U+2013>5. Having lost her last 11 sets in a row to Sharapova, Stosur stormed through the opening set in just 28 minutes, then rallied from 3<U+2013>0 down in the second set, with Sharapova missing a backhand return on match point. Both players had similar amounts of winners throughout the match <U+2013> Stosur 18, Sharapova 17 <U+2013> but Sharapova's 30 unforced errors far outweighed Stosur's 17 miscues.<ref>{{cite web |work=Sony Ericsson Championship Website |title=Stosur Surprises Sharapova To Conclude Day 1|url=http://www.wtachampionships.com/page/LatestNews/Read/0,,12910~2494201,00.html |date=2011-10-26|deadurl=no}}</ref>

====Day 2====
The second day began with Belarus' [[Victoria Azarenka]] and Australia's [[Samantha Stosur]], Azarenka lead their head-to-head 4<U+2013>0. With her intense and relentless barrage of deep, penetrating groundstrokes, the No.4-seeded Azarenka never really let the No.7-seeded Stosur into the match, losing just five points in seven service games and breaking four times in building a 6<U+2013>2, 5<U+2013>2 lead. Stosur put up a fight in a 10-minute final game, saving three match points - including two on big inside out forehand winners - but Azarenka wrapped up the one-hour, 17-minute triumph on her fourth match point. In their winners to unforced errors ratio, Stosur was 11<U+2013>26, Azarenka was 16<U+2013>13.<ref>{{cite web |work=Sony Ericsson Championship Website |title=Azarenka Stays Dominant Over Stosur|url=http://www.wtachampionships.com/page/LatestNews/Read/0,,12910~2495286,00.html|date=2011-10-26|deadurl=no}}</ref>

The second match saw French Open Champion [[Li Na (tennis)|Li Na]] making her debut against no. 2 seed [[Maria Sharapova]]. Having not won a match since August - she lost first round at her last two events at the US Open and Beijing, and in straight sets too - Li's game came alive at the TEB BNP Paribas WTA Championships, as her power game clicked against one of the most powerful players in the game. She rallied from 2-4 to take the first set to a tie-break, where she rallied from 0<U+2013>4 to take the set; she then held off a late surge from Sharapova in the second set, watching a 5<U+2013>2 lead close to 5<U+2013>4 before finally serving out the victory in front of a packed crowd. Li had been struggling since becoming Asia's first Grand Slam champion at the French Open, going 5<U+2013>7 in her seven tournaments since <U+2013> but she had won her last three meetings against Sharapova in straight sets and brought that magic out again, getting just a few more winners in the winners column - 15 to 12. Li is the first Chinese ever to compete in singles at the year-end finale. Later in the day, Sharapova withdrew with a left ankle injury, ending her chance to finish the year at No.1.<ref>{{cite web |work=Sony Ericsson Championship Website |title=Dynamite WTA Championships Debut For Li|url=http://www.wtachampionships.com/page/LatestNews/Read/0,,12910~2495455,00.html|date=2011-10-26|deadurl=no}}</ref>

The last match of the day came between two former US Open finalists [[Vera Zvonareva]] and [[Caroline Wozniacki]], who has split their former 8 matches in half. Zvonareva, the No.6 seed, was the clear aggressor in the match, going for her big groundstrokes <U+2013> including some particularly impressive backhands <U+2013> to take the first set in just 35 minutes. Wozniacki broke in the last game of the second set to push the match to a third but Zvonareva came alive again, racing out to a double-break 4<U+2013>1 lead and barely looking back. The Russian, who just turned 27 last month, won the last seven points of the match to end it 6<U+2013>2, 4<U+2013>6, 6<U+2013>3. Although both Zvonareva and Wozniacki are known for their strong defensive skills, the Russian's offense really shone through at the Sinan Erdem Dome <U+2013> she had by far the bigger numbers for the day, 49 winners to 49 unforced errors (Wozniacki finished the match with 13 winners to 18 unforced errors).<ref>{{cite web |work=Sony Ericsson Championship Website |title=Vera Victorious Over Caroline In Red Group Battle|url=http://www.wtachampionships.com/page/LatestNews/Read/0,,12910~2495583,00.html|date=2011-10-26|deadurl=no}}</ref>

====Day 3====
The first match featured white group's [[Victoria Azarenka]] and [[Li Na (tennis)|Li Na]].  Victoria Azarenka was a relentless wall of power at the TEB BNP Paribas WTA Championships on Thursday, getting revenge for losses at the Australian and French Opens with a commanding 6<U+2013>2, 6<U+2013>2 win over Li Na. Azarenka, who lost to Li in straight sets in the fourth round in Melbourne and in the quarterfinals in Paris - and had actually lost four of the pair's five previous meetings - was sharper in every department against Li this time, controlling most of the rallies with her powerful groundstrokes and sending any of the Chinese trailblazer's own powerful groundstrokes back with added interest. Although Li hit twice as many winners as Azarenka (18 to 9) those were far outweighed by more than twice as many unforced errors (39 to 17). Having beaten Samantha Stosur by an identical scoreline on Wednesday, Azarenka is now 2<U+2013>0 in the White Group and the first to qualify for the semifinals.<ref>{{cite web |work=Sony Ericsson Championship Website |title=Azarenka First To Secure Semifinal Spot In Istanbul|url=http://www.wtachampionships.com/page/LatestNews/Read/0,,12910~2496592,00.html|date=2011-10-27|deadurl=no}}</ref>

The second match saw top seed [[Caroline Wozniacki]] taking on third seed [[Petra Kvitov<U+00E1>]].With a swift 6<U+2013>4, 6<U+2013>2 win over Caroline Wozniacki, Petra Kvitov<U+00E1> not only scored her second win over a reigning No.1, she also got the second spot in the TEB BNP Paribas WTA Championships semifinals. Kvitov<U+00E1>, the No.3 seed, beat the No.1-seeded Wozniacki in style, losing just 17 points in nine service games and breaking Wozniacki three times, including in the first game of each set. The No.3-ranked Czech - just the fourth Czech player ever to rank in the Top 3, after Martina Navratilova, Hana Mandl<U+00ED>kov<U+00E1> and Jana Novotn<U+00E1> - served seven aces in the one-hour, 24-minute victory.<ref>{{cite web |work=Sony Ericsson Championship Website |title=Kvitova Conquers Wozniacki To Secure Semifinal Berth|url=http://www.wtachampionships.com/page/LatestNews/Read/0,,12910~2496718,00.html|date=2011-10-27|deadurl=no}}</ref>

The last match was one of the most enthralling one in tournament so far with Russian [[Vera Zvonareva]] taking on Pole [[Agnieszka Radwa<U+0144>ska]]. Zvonareva wouldn't have just qualified for the semifinals with a victory over Radwa<U+0144>ska, she would have snapped a three-match losing streak against her, having lost to her at Carlsbad, Toronto and Tokyo in the last few months - all in straight sets, too. This one would be much different. It took just 35 minutes for the No.6-seeded Zvonareva to win the first set, 6<U+2013>1; Radwa<U+0144>ska, the No.8 seed, retaliated with a 6<U+2013>2 second set. An aggressive Zvonareva regrouped and got to double match point at 5<U+2013>3, 40<U+2013>15 in the third set but missed down-the-lines on both of those, then lost an extended exchange on her third match point in the same game. She would eventually lose to Radwa<U+0144>ska for a fourth straight time, 1<U+2013>6, 6<U+2013>2 7<U+2013>5.<ref>{{cite web |work=Sony Ericsson Championship Website |title=Radwanska Rallies Past Zvonareva On Day 3|url=http://www.wtachampionships.com/page/LatestNews/Read/0,,12910~2496831,00.html|date=2011-10-27|deadurl=no}}</ref>

====Day 4====
The first match saw two Slam champions between [[Li Na (tennis)|Li Na]] and [[Samantha Stosur]], with the winner advancing to the semifinals. Samantha Stosur served up a barrage of kick serves and blasted some ferocious forehands to completely confound Li Na in 66 minutes, 6<U+2013>1, 6<U+2013>0, improving to 6<U+2013>0 in the pair's head-to-head series and dealing the Chinese her most lopsided loss on the WTA in almost three and a half years. Their sixth meeting at the TEB BNP Paribas WTA Championships on Friday was by far their quickest, as Stosur hit far more winners (15 to 4) and was cleaner on the unforced errors (22 to 32) and basically dominated every department, losing her serve from 30-0 up in the fifth game of the match but otherwise winning every game en route to her easiest victory since Dubai in February.<ref>{{cite web |work=Sony Ericsson Championship Website |title=Rout Of Li Sends Stosur Into Semis|url=http://www.wtachampionships.com/page/LatestNews/Read/0,,12910~2497763,00.html|date=2011-10-28|deadurl=no}}</ref>

The second match saw [[Agnieszka Radwa<U+0144>ska]] trying to advance to the semifinals taking on [[Petra Kvitov<U+00E1>]]. With Kvitov<U+00E1>, Victoria Azarenka and Samantha Stosur already through, Radwa<U+0144>ska had to take a set from Kvitov<U+00E1> on Friday to become the fourth player into the final four. And that goal didn't seem far away at all as she stormed out to a 5<U+2013>1 first set lead - but Kvitov<U+00E1> suddenly came alive, her power game hitting its mark as she stormed back to take the opening set comfortably in a tie-break. Although there were a few close moments midway through the second set - she went to six deuces before holding in a marathon game for 4<U+2013>3 - Kvitov<U+00E1> never really looked in trouble again, eventually finishing the match off with a big crosscourt forehand that drew one last backhand error from Radwa<U+0144>ska. Whether she was winning or losing, Kvitov<U+00E1> seemed to be in complete control of the score against Radwa<U+0144>ska - she finished the match with 42 winners to 47 unforced errors, while Radwa<U+0144>ska had eight winners to 17 unforced errors. Kvitov<U+00E1> finished first in the Red Group with a bullet, 3<U+2013>0 in win-loss and 6<U+2013>0 in sets. Although Zvonareva, Radwa<U+0144>ska and Caroline Wozniacki all ended with a 1<U+2013>2 win<U+2013>loss record and 3<U+2013>5 sets won-lost, Zvonareva had the best games won-lost percentage of the three and thus finished second in the Red Group. The semifinals will be Red Group No.1 Kvitov<U+00E1> taking on White Group No.2 Stosur, and White Group No.1 Azarenka taking on Red Group No.2 Zvonareva.

In the last round robin match of the week on Friday night, [[Victoria Azarenka]] took on alternate Marion Bartoli. The result, a 5<U+2013>7, 6<U+2013>4, 6<U+2013>4 win for Bartoli, had no effect on either group's standings. However, Azarenka was accused of tanking the final set of the match, going for winners at the get go and not willing to track down balls.<ref>{{cite web |work=Sony Ericsson Championship Website |title=Petra Stays Perfect In Red Group|url=http://www.wtachampionships.com/page/LatestNews/Read/0,,12910~2497884,00.html|date=2011-10-28|deadurl=no}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |work=Tennis world USA |title=WTA Istanbul - Azarenka slammed for lack of effort against Bartoli|url=http://www.tennisworldusa.org/WTA-Istanbul---Azarenka-slammed-for-lack-of-effort-against-Bartoli-articolo2064.html|date=2011-10-28|deadurl=no}}</ref>

===Semifinals===

====Day 5====
The first singles semifinal match saw white group no. 1 [[Petra Kvitov<U+00E1>]] and red group no. 2 [[Samantha Stosur]]. Kvitov<U+00E1> was the only player to make it through the round robin undefeated, but she showed some cracks in her last match on Friday, falling behind 5<U+2013>1 in the first set before rallying to beat Agnieszka Radwa<U+0144>ska in straights. And although she was up an early break she had somewhat of a slowish start again against a confident Stosur, who came back to take the first set and eventually build a 7<U+2013>5, 1<U+2013>0 lead, with a break point to go up 7<U+2013>5, 2<U+2013>0. Just like she did before, though, Kvitov<U+00E1> came alive when she needed to, winning six of the next eight games to take the second set 6<U+2013>3, then racing ahead 5<U+2013>0 in the third. Stosur made things exciting at the end by winning three straight games to close to 5<U+2013>3, but the Wimbledon champion held on, closing out the US Open champion with a love hold 5<U+2013>7, 6<U+2013>3, 6<U+2013>3. Both Kvitov<U+00E1> and Stosur finished with clean winners-to-errors differentials (Kvitov<U+00E1> 38<U+2013>39, Stosur 16<U+2013>18) but the biggest difference came in creating break point opportunities <U+2013> Kvitov<U+00E1> brought up 11 break points (converting on five) while Stosur only got six break points (converting on three).<ref>{{cite web |work=Sony Ericsson Championship Website |title=Petra Pushed En Route To Istanbul Final|url=http://www.wtachampionships.com/page/LatestNews/Read/0,,12910~2498603,00.html|date=2011-10-29|deadurl=no}}</ref>

The second semifinal featured red group no. 1 [[Victoria Azarenka]] and white group no. 2 [[Vera Zvonareva]]. She broke serve three times in the first set, including once at love. There were some tough moments in the 59-minute second set, including a marathon six-deuce fourth game where Zvonareva defied four break points to hold for 2<U+2013>all, but Azarenka got a late break and save two brek points at the final game and served it out, It is her fourth win in their 10 meetings. Azarenka of Belarus eventually won 6<U+2013>2, 6<U+2013>3 Saturday to reach the final of the WTA Championships. The No. 4-ranked Azarenka's solid groundstrokes forced errors from No. 6 Zvonareva, who was never able to gain momentum in the match.<ref>{{cite web |work=Sony Ericsson Championship Website |title=Azarenka, Kvitova To Vie For Title In Istanbul|url=http://www.wtachampionships.com/page/LatestNews/Read/0,,12910~2498808,00.html|date=2011-10-29|deadurl=no}}</ref>

In the doubles, Peschke and Srebotnik, the No.1 seeds, were the first team into the final, getting the only break of serve in the first set then rebounding after a second set lapse to beat Vania King and Yaroslava Shvedova 6<U+2013>3, 6<U+2013>4. Peschke and Srebotnik broke King's serve en route to taking the opening set and built a 3<U+2013>0 lead in the second, only to lose four straight games; but the momentum swung again and they won three more games of their own to close it out. Huber and Raymond, the No.2 seeds, followed with a 4<U+2013>6, 6<U+2013>3, [10<U+2013>7] victory over Gisela Dulko and Flavia Pennetta, the defending champs at the year-ender. Huber and Raymond not only rallied from a set down to win, they also came back from 3<U+2013>6 in the match tie-break, Huber hitting winners on four of the last five points of the match (two drop volley winners and two big overheads).<ref>{{cite web |work=Sony Ericsson Championship Website |title=Top 2 Seeds To Square Off In Doubles Final|url=http://www.wtachampionships.com/page/LatestNews/Read/0,,12910~2498972,00.html|date=2011-10-29|deadurl=no}}</ref>

===Finals===

====Day 6====
The first match was the Doubles Final between the top two seeds [[Kv<U+011B>ta Peschke]] & [[Katarina Srebotnik]] and [[Liezel Huber]] & [[Lisa Raymond]]. Liezel Huber and Lisa Raymond wrapped up a breakthrough year at the TEB BNP Paribas WTA Championships, capturing their fourth title in their last six events with a 64 64 win on Sunday over Kv<U+011B>ta Peschke and Katarina Srebotnik, losing three straight games from 64 31 but regrouping and winning three straight games of their own to finish it. They fell short on their first two match points but Huber closed it out with a backhand volley at Srebotnik's body.<ref>{{cite web |work=Sony Ericsson Championship Website |title=Liezel & Lisa Lift Istanbul Trophy|url=http://www.wtachampionships.com/page/LatestNews/Read/0,,12910~2499709,00.html|date=2011-10-30|deadurl=no}}</ref>
