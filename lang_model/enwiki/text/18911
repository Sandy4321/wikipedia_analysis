The present-day '''Fiat Multipla''' is a [[compact MPV]] manufactured by Italian automaker [[Fiat]] since 1998. Based on the [[Fiat Brava|Brava]], the Multipla was quite unlike any other on the market.  It was much shorter and wider than its rivals, and it had two rows of three seats, while all its competitors had two seats in the front (the [[Honda FR-V]], which has the same layout, was released in 2004).

In common with a number of other modern Fiats, the Multipla reuses the name of an earlier vehicle, in this case the "Multipla" variant of the [[Fiat 600]] produced during the 1950s and 1960s.

== Design ==
The exterior and interior design of the Multipla was unique and had a polarizing effect&mdash;some people loved it, some hated it. Nonetheless, the Multipla was displayed at the [[Museum of Modern Art]] (MOMA) in New York during its "Different Roads - Automobiles for the Next Century" exhibition in 1999.

Multipla sales began in Italy late in 1998 but most other markets had to wait a year before receiving imports. The power of the Fiat badge meant that the Multipla was an instant hit with Italian buyers, but its styling meant that sales elsewhere were less successful. This ultimately led to the car being voted 'Ugliest Car' in the Top Gear awards 1999.

In 2004 the Multipla underwent a major facelift to shed its original styling for a more restrained look, with the intention of attracting more buyers.

== Engines ==
The {{Auto PS|103}} 1.6-litre [[petrol]] and {{Auto PS|120}} 1.9-litre [[turbodiesel]] engines give the Multipla good levels of performance and refinement, and the chassis ensures entertaining ride and handling. A "Bi-Power" Multipla that runs on both petrol and [[compressed natural gas|CNG]] (methane) is offered in certain markets.

== Inner room and flexibility ==
The new generation Multipla was hailed by [[journalist]]s at its launch for its flexibility. The new Multipla<U+2019>s three-abreast seating configuration allows for adjustment of the front seats and the removal and [[relocation]] of the rear seats into numerous formats. It also affords a class-leading 430 litres of luggage space which can increase to 1900 litres of flat floor load space with the rear three seats removed from the vehicle.
