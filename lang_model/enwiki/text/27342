'''Maria Rasputin''' ([[March 26]], [[1898]]- September 1977),<ref name="alexander palace">{{cite web | author=alexander palace | year=| title = "Rasputin's True Age, a thread at alexanderpalace.org" | Work= "alexanderpalace.org" | url=http://forum.alexanderpalace.org/index.php/topic,8001.0.html| accessdate= March 4| accessyear=2007}}</ref><ref name="Robert Alexander">Alexander, Robert, ''Rasputin's Daughter,'' Penguin Books, 2006, ISBN 978-0-14-303865-8, pp. 297-298</ref> born '''Matryona Grigorievna Rasputina,'''<ref name="Robert Alexander"/> was the daughter of the [[starets]] [[Grigori Rasputin]] and his wife Praskovia Fyodorovna Dubrovina.

Following the [[Russian Revolution of 1917]], she wrote several memoirs about her father's life, murder, and association with [[Nicholas II of Russia|Tsar Nicholas II]] and [[Alexandra Fyodorovna (Alix of Hesse)|Tsarina Alexandra Fyodorovna]].

==Early life==
Maria was born in the [[Siberia|Siberian]] village of [[Pokrovskoye, Tyumen Oblast|Pokrovskoye]], but came to [[St. Petersburg]] as a teenager, where her first name was changed from Matryona to Maria to better fit with her social aspirations.<ref name="Robert Alexander"/> Rasputin had brought Maria and her younger sister Varvara to live with him and attend Steblin-Kamensky private preparatory school in [[St. Petersburg]] in 1913 with the hope of turning them into "little ladies."<ref>Edvard Radzinsky, ''The Rasputin File,'' Doubleday, 2000, ISBN 0-385-48909-9, p. 201.</ref> Maria was Rasputin's favorite child.<ref>Radzinsky, ''The Rasputin File,'' p. 492</ref> 

The writer Vera Zhukovskaya later described sixteen-year-old Maria as having a wide face with a square chin and "bright-colored lips" that she frequently licked in a movement Zhukovskaya thought was predatory. Her strong body seemed about to burst out of its cashmere dress and smelled of sweat.<ref>Radzinsky, ''The Rasputin File,'' p. 202</ref> Society ladies kissed the tall teenager and called her by her pet names "Mara" and "Marochka" during one gathering at her father's modest apartment. Zhurovskaya thought it was odd to see Rasputin's daughter receiving so much attention from princesses and countesses.<ref>Radzinsky, ''The Rasputin File,'' p. 216</ref>

Maria later told her grandchildren that her father taught her to be generous even in times when she was in need herself. Rasputin said she should never leave home with empty pockets, but should always have something in them to give to the poor.<ref name="Stolyarova">{{cite web | author=Stolyarova, Galina | year=2005| title = "Rasputin's Notoriety Dismays Relative" | Work= "The St. Petersburg Times(St. Petersburg, Russia)" | url=http://www.sptimes.ru/index.php?action_id=2&story_id=15435| accessdate= February 18| accessyear=2007}}</ref>

==Death of Rasputin==
Rasputin's daughters were living with him in a small apartment in St. Petersburg in December 1916 when he was lured to his death at a party at the home of [[Felix Yussupov]], whom Rasputin called "The Little One."<ref>Radzinsky, ''The Rasputin File'', pp. 452-454</ref> They reported their father's movements to police investigators the following day and identified boots pulled out of the river as belonging to their father.<ref>Radzinsky, ''The Rasputin File,''  pp. 452-454</ref>

In April 1918, as the Tsar and Tsarina were traveling to their final exile at [[Ekaterinburg]], Alexandra looked out the window of the train at Pokrovskoye and saw Rasputin's family and friends staring back at them from the window of Rasputin's house.<ref>Radzinsky, ''The Rasputin File,'' p. 494</ref> 

==Life following the Revolution==
Maria was briefly engaged during [[World War I]] to a [[Georgia (country)|Georgian]] officer surnamed Pankhadze. Pankhadze had avoided being sent to the war front thanks to Rasputin's intervention and was doing his military service with the reserve battalions in St. Petersburg.<ref>Radzinsky, ''The Rasputin File,'' p. 385</ref> 

After Rasputin's murder, Rasputin's followers persuaded her to marry Boris Soloviev, the charismatic son of Nikolai Soloviev, the Treasurer of the Holy Synod and one of her father's admirers. Boris Soloviev quickly emerged as Rasputin's successor after the murder. Soloviev, who had studied [[hypnotism]], attended meetings at which Rasputin's followers attempted to communicate with the dead through prayer meetings and [[S<U+00E9>ance|s<U+00E9>ances]]. <ref>Robert K. Massie, ''Nicholas and Alexandra,'' Dell Publishing Co., 1967, ISBN 0440163587, p. 487</ref> Maria also attended the meetings, but later wrote in her diary that she couldn't understand why her father kept telling her to "love Boris" when the group spoke to him at the s<U+00E9>ances. She said she didn't like Boris at all.<ref>Massie, p. 487</ref> Soloviev was no more enthusiastic about Maria. In his own diary, he wrote that his wife wasn't even useful for sexual relations, because there were so many women who had bodies he found more attractive than Maria's.<ref>Radzinsky, Edvard,'' The Last Tsar,'' Doubleday, 1992, ISBN 0-385-42371-3, p. 230</ref> Nonetheless, she married Soloviev on [[October 5]], [[1917]]. They returned to Siberia and lived for several weeks in Rasputin's house at Pokrovskoye.<ref>Massie, p. 487</ref> Later, Soloviev took jewels from the Tsar and Tsarina to help arrange for their escape, but kept the funds for himself. Later, after the Bolsheviks took power, Soloviev turned in the officers who had come to Ekaterinburg to plan the escape of the Romanovs. Soloviev lost the money he had obtained from the jewels during the civil war that followed.<ref>Radzinsky, ''The Rasputin File,'' pp. 493-493</ref> There were also several reports of young people in Russia passing themselves off as Romanov escapees following the Revolution.  Soloviev defrauded prominent Russian families by asking for money for a Romanov impostor to escape to China. Soloviev also found young women willing to masquerade as one of the grand duchesses for the benefit of the families he had defrauded.<ref>Occleshaw, Michael, ''The Romanov Conspiracies: The Romanovs and the House of Windsor,'' Orion Publishing Group Ltd., 1993, ISBN 1-85592-518-4 p. 47</ref>

==Exile==
Soloviev and Maria eventually emigrated to Paris, where Soloviev worked in an automobile factory and later died of [[tuberculosis]] in 1926.<ref>Radzinsky, ''The Rasputin File,'' p. 494</ref> Maria found work as a governess to support their two young daughters. After [[Felix Yussupov]] published his memoir detailing the death of her father, Maria sued Yussupov and [[Grand Duke Dmitri Pavlovich of Russia]] in a Paris court for damages of $800,000. She condemned both men as murderer and said any decent person would be disgusted by the ferocity of Rasputin's killing. <ref>King, Greg, ''The Man Who Killed Rasputin,'' Carol Publishing Group, 1995, ISBN 0-8065-1971-1, p. 232</ref> Maria's claim was dismissed. The French court ruled that it had no jurisdiction over a political killing that took place in Russia.<ref>King, p. 233</ref>

Maria published the first of three memoirs about Rasputin in 1932. It was entitled ''Rasputin, My Father.'' <ref>Radzinsky, pp. 493-494</ref> <ref>King, pp. 232-233</ref> She also later co-authored a cookbook, which includes recipes for jellied fish heads and her father's favorite, cod soup.<ref>Alexander, pp. 297-298</ref> She also worked as a [[cabaret]] dancer in [[Bucharest]], [[Romania]] <ref name="Barry">{{cite web | author=Barry, Rey | year= 1968| title = "Kind Rasputin" | Work= "The Daily Progress (Charlottesville, Virginia, USA)" | url=http://www.freewarehof.org/manahans.html| accessdate= February 18| accessyear=2007}}</ref> and then found work as a circus performer for [[Ringling Brothers Circus]]. During the 1930s she toured Europe and America as a [[lion taming|lion tamer]], billing herself as "the daughter of the famous mad monk whose feats in Russia astonished the world."<ref>Massie, p. 526</ref> She was mauled by a bear in [[Peru, Indiana]], but stayed with the circus until it reached [[Miami, Florida]], where she quit and began work as a [[Rosie the Riveter|riveter]] in a defense shipyard during [[World War II]].<ref name="Barry"/> She settled permanently in the United States in 1937 and became a United States citizen in 1945. She was married at one point to a man named Gregory Bernadsky, whom she married in 1940.<ref name=''Time Magazine''>{{cite web | author=Time magazine | year=1940| title = "U.S. news briefs" | Work= "Time magazine" | url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,763606,00.html?promoid=googlep| accessdate= March 4| accessyear=2007}}</ref> 

Maria worked in defense plants until 1955, when she was forced to retire because of her age. After that, she supported herself by working in hospitals, giving Russian lessons, and babysitting for friends.<ref name="Wallechinsky and Wallace">{{cite web | author=Wallechinsky, David, and Wallace, Irving| year= 1975-1981| title = "People's Almanac Series" | Work= "Famous Family History Grigori Rasputin Children" | url=http://www.trivia-library.com/b/famous-family-history-grigori-rasputin-children.htm| accessdate= February 18| accessyear=2007}}</ref>

Maria claimed to be [[psychic]] in 1968 and said [[Betty Ford]] had come to her in a dream and smiled.<ref name="Barry"/> At one point she said she recognized [[Anna Anderson]] as [[Grand Duchess Anastasia Nikolaevna of Russia]]. A friend called her "Little Mother" because Maria fretted over whether handbags were in reach of strangers in restaurants, open suitcases in hotel rooms, and whether a reporter who was interviewing her had been given a comfortable enough chair.<ref name="Barry"/> She also obtained an income from [[Social Security]] payments.<ref name="Alexander"/> She lived near the Hollywood Freeway in [[Los Angeles]] during the last years of her life.<ref>Massie, p. 526</ref> At one point she had two pet dogs, whom she called Youssou and Pov after Felix Yussupov.<ref>King, p. 277</ref> 

==Legacy==
One of Maria's two daughters married the Dutch ambassador to Greece and later became friends with Yussupov's daughter, Irina Felixovna, during the 1940s.<ref>Radzinsky, ''The Rasputin File,'' p. 500</ref> Maria told her four grandchildren that their infamous great-grandfather was a "simple man with a big heart and strong spiritual power, who loved Russia, God, and the Tsar," her granddaughter Laurence Huot-Solovieff, the daughter of Maria's daughter Tatyana, recalled in 2005.<ref name="Stolyarova"/> Maria's descendants live today near [[Paris]].<ref name="Alexander"/> A fictionalized account of Maria's life recently appeared in the 2006 novel ''Rasputin's Daughter,'' by Robert Alexander.<ref name="Alexander"/>
