'''Milo''' ([[Greek language|Greek]]: <U+039C><U+03AF><U+03BB><U+03C9><U+03BD>) '''of Croton''' was a 6th century&nbsp;BC [[Greek wrestling|wrestler]] from the Greek colony of [[Crotone|Croton]] in [[southern Italy]] who enjoyed a brilliant wrestling career and won many victories in the most important athletic festivals of [[ancient Greece]].<ref name="Spivey">{{cite book |last=Spivey |first=Nigel Jonathan |title=The Ancient Olympics |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |location=Oxford and New York |date=2004 |pages=65&ndash;66, 100&ndash;101 |isbn=0-19-280433-2 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=_kcwp0RYS7sC&pg=PA100&dq=Milo+of+Kroton+Croton&lr=lang_en&num=100&as_brr=0&as_pt=ALLTYPES&ie=ISO-8859-1&output=html |accessdate=2009-03-01}}</ref><ref name="Poliakoff">{{cite book |last=Poliakoff |first=Michael B. |title=Combat Sports in the Ancient World |publisher=[[Yale University Press]] |location=New Haven and London |date=1987 |pages=117&ndash;119, 182&ndash;183 |isbn=0-300-03768-6 (cloth); 0-300-06312-1 (pbk.) |url=http://books.google.com/books?lr=&ie=ISO-8859-1&output=html&as_brr=0&as_pt=ALLTYPES&id=e2EyPI8X8FMC&dq=Poliakoff+Combat+Sports&pg=PP1&lpg=PP1&sig=ACfU3U2EtKcBTLnIabdwAAYWjL2dDLCC8Q&q=Milo |accessdate=2009-03-01}}</ref><ref name="Harris">{{cite book |last=Harris |first=H.A. |title=Greek Athletes and Athletics |publisher=Hutchinson & Co. |location=London |pages=110&ndash;113 |date=1964}}</ref>  In addition to his athletic victories, Milo is credited by the ancient commentator [[Diodorus Siculus]] with leading his fellow citizens to military triumph over neighboring Sybaris in 510&nbsp;BC.

Milo was said to be an associate of [[Pythagoras]]. One story tells of the wrestler saving the philosopher's life when a roof was about to collapse upon him, and another that Milo may have married the philosopher's daughter Muia. Like other successful athletes of ancient Greece, Milo was the subject of fantastic tales of strength and power, some, perhaps, based upon misinterpretations of his statues.  Among other tales, he was said to have carried a bull on his shoulders, and to have burst a band about his brow by simply inflating the veins of his temples.

The date of Milo's death is unknown, but he reportedly was attempting to rend a tree asunder when his hands became trapped in the cleft of its trunk, and a pack of wolves surprised and devoured him.   Milo has been depicted in works of art by [[Pierre Puget]], [[<U+00C9>tienne-Maurice Falconet]], and others. In literature, he has been referenced by [[Rabelais]] in ''[[Gargantua and Pantagruel]]'' and by [[Shakespeare]] in ''[[Troilus and Cressida]]''. 

==Achievements==    
===Athletic career===
Milo was a six time [[Ancient Olympic Games|Olympic]] victor.  He won the boys' [[Greek wrestling|wrestling]] (probably in 540&nbsp;BC),<ref>At Olympia, a "boy" was a male between his seventeenth and twentieth birthday. (Harris, p. 154&ndash;155)</ref> and thereafter five men's wrestling titles between 536 and 520&nbsp;BC.<ref name="Spivey" /><ref name="Poliakoff" /><ref name="Harris" />  He also won seven crowns at the [[Pythian Games]] at [[Delphi]] (one as a boy), ten at the [[Isthmian Games]], and nine at the [[Nemean Games]].<ref name="Poliakoff" />  Milo was a five time ''Periodonik<U+0113>s'', a "[[grand slam]]" sort of title bestowed on the winner of all four festivals in the same cycle.<ref name="Harris" />  Milo's career at the highest level of competition must have spanned 24 years.<ref name="Poliakoff" />

Milo was defeated (or tied) in his attempt at a seventh Olympic title in 516&nbsp;BC by a young wrestler from Croton who practiced the technique of ''akrocheirismos''&mdash;literally, 'highhandedness', or wrestling at arm's length&mdash;and, by doing so, avoided Milo's crushing embrace.  Simple fatigue took its toll on Milo.<ref name="Spivey" /><ref name="Poliakoff" /><ref name="Harris" />

Milo's hometown had a reputation for producing excellent athletes. In the Olympiad of 576&nbsp;BC, for example, the first seven finishers in the [[Stadion (ancient sports)|stade]] &ndash; a {{convert|200|yd|m}} sprint &ndash; were all men of Croton.  After Milo's career, Croton apparently produced no other athletes of renown.<ref name="Harris" />

===Military experience===
[[File:Herakles Niobid krater Louvre G341.jpg|thumb|upright|Heracles wearing a hero's wreath, a lion-skin, and carrying a club. Milo appeared in similar dress at the battle between Croton and Sybaris in 510&nbsp;BC. (Attic red-figure calyx-krater, ca. 460<U+2013>450&nbsp;BC, Louvre)]]

About 510&nbsp;BC, hostilities arose between Croton and nearby Sybaris when Telys, a Sybarite tyrant, banished the 500 wealthiest citizens of Sybaris after seizing their property.  When the displaced Sybarites sought refuge at Croton and Telys demanded their return, an opportunity for the Crotoniates to destroy a powerful neighbor presented itself.<ref>{{cite book |last=Boardman |first=John |coauthor=N.G.L. Hammond |title=The Cambridge Ancient History |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |date=1982 |page=194 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=0qAoqP4g1fEC&pg=PA194&dq=Sybaris+Croton&lr=lang_en&num=100&as_brr=3&as_pt=BOOKS&ie=ISO-8859-1&output=html |accessdate=2009-04-03}}</ref>  In an account that appeared five hundred years after the event, [[Diodorus Siculus]] wrote that the philosopher [[Pythagoras]], who spent much of his life at Croton, urged the Croton assembly to protect the banished citizens of Sybaris. When the decision to do so was made, the dispute between the two cities was aggravated, each took up arms, and Milo led the charge against Sybaris.<ref name="Harris" /><ref name="Guthrie">{{cite book |last=Guthrie |first=William Keith Chambers |title=A History of Greek Philosophy |publisher=Cambridge University Press |date=1962 |page=176 |isbn=0-521-05159-2 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=ogUR3V9wbbIC&pg=PA176&dq=Pythagoras+Milo+Milon&lr=lang_en&as_drrb_is=q&as_minm_is=1&as_miny_is=2009&as_maxm_is=12&as_maxy_is=2009&num=100&as_brr=3&as_pt=BOOKS&ie=ISO-8859-1&output=html |accessdate=2009-04-03}}</ref>

According to Diodorus:<blockquote>"One hundred thousand men of Croton were stationed with three hundred thousand Sybarite troops ranged against them.  Milo the athlete led them and through his tremendous physical strength first turned the troops lined up against him."</blockquote>

Diodorus indicates Milo led the charge against the Sybarites wearing his Olympic crowns, draped in a lionskin and brandishing a club in a manner similar to the mythic hero [[Heracles]].<ref name="Spivey" /><ref name="Poliakoff" /><ref name="Harris" />

==Personal life==
Ancient commentators mention an association between Milo and the philosopher [[Pythagoras]], who lived at or near Croton for many years.<ref name="Poliakoff"/> Commentators may have confused the philosopher with an athletic trainer, Pythagoras of Samos, but it is also possible the trainer and the philosopher were the same person.<ref>{{cite book |last=Reidwig |first=Christoph |coauthor=Steven Rendall |title=Pythagoras |publisher=Cornell University Press |date=2005 |page=10 |isbn=0-8014-4240-0 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=2gLPbFKwY5EC&pg=PA10&lpg=PA10&dq=Pythagoras+Samos+trainer+athlete&lr=lang_en&num=100&as_brr=3&as_pt=BOOKS&ie=ISO-8859-1&output=html |accessdate=2009-04-03}}</ref>

It was said Milo saved Pythagoras's life when a pillar collapsed in a banquet  hall and he supported the roof until Pythagoras could reach safety.<ref name="Poliakoff"/>  He may have married Muia, a Pythagorean herself or possibly Pythagoras' daughter.<ref name="Poliakoff"/><ref name="Harris"/> [[Diogenes Laertius]] says Pythagoras died in a fire in Milo's house,<ref name="Poliakoff"/> but [[Dicaearchus]] says Pythagoras died in the temple of the Muses at [[Metapontum]] of self-imposed starvation. [[Porphyry]] says Milo's house at Croton was burned and the Pythagoreans within stoned.<ref>{{cite book |last=Guthrie |first=Kenneth Sylvan |title=The Pythagorean Sourcebook and Library |publisher=Phanes Press |date=1987 |page=134, 151&ndash;152 |isbn=0-933999-50-X |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=EigQoSZCUAwC&pg=PA151&vq=milo&dq=Pythagoras+Milo&lr=lang_en&num=100&as_brr=3&as_pt=BOOKS&ie=ISO-8859-1&output=html&source=gbs_search_s&cad=0 |accessdate=2009-04-03}}</ref>    
 
[[Herodotus]], who lived one hundred years after Milo's death, says the wrestler accepted a large sum of money from the distinguished physician [[Democedes]] for the privilege of marrying Milo's daughter.  If Herodotus is indeed correct then Milo was probably not a member of Croton's nobility for such an arrangement with a wage-earning physician would have been beneath the dignity of a Greek noble.<ref name="Poliakoff"/> Democedes was a native of Croton and enjoyed a successful career as a physician at Croton, Aegina, Athens, and Samos. He was captured by [[Darius]] in the defeat of the Samian tyrant [[Polycrates]] and taken to the [[Persia|Persian]] capital of [[Susa]] as a slave.  There, he carefully tended both the king and queen and was eventually permitted to revisit Croton but under guard.  He escaped his Persian guards and made his way to Croton where he married Milo's daughter.  The physician sent a message regarding his marriage to Darius who was an admirer of the wrestler and can only have learned of him through Democedes during his slavery at Susa.<ref>(Harris, p. 113; Herodotus, III:137&ndash;138)</ref>

==Cultural representations==
===Place of champions in Greek culture===
Like the [[tragedy|tragic]] protagonists of Greek drama, the Greek athlete had a "larger than life" quality.  At Olympia, for example, they were set apart from the general population for lengthy training periods and the observation of a complex series of prohibitions that included abstinence from heterosexual intercourse. Once training was completed and the athletes were brought before their fellow citizens trim, fit, nude and shimmering with oil, they must have appeared semi-divine.<ref name="Larmour">{{cite book |last=Larmour |first=David Henry James |title=Stage and Stadium |publisher=Weidmann |location=Hildesheim |date=1999 |pages=56&ndash;58 |isbn=3-615-00209-1 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=QSfs9D2ywT0C&pg=PA56&lpg=PA57&dq=Milo+Croton&lr=lang_en&num=100&as_brr=3&as_pt=ALLTYPES&ie=ISO-8859-1&output=html |accessdate=2009-04-03}}</ref> 

The reverential awe in which athletes were held in Greece led to exaggeration in the tales surrounding their lives.  In Milo's case, [[Aristotle]] began the myth-making process with reports likening Milo unto Heracles in his enormous appetite, and [[Athenaeus]] continued the process with the story of Milo carrying a bull&mdash;a feat also associated with Heracles.  It is Milo's sudden and tragic death which makes him most akin to the heroes: there is a hint of [[hubris]] in his attempt to rend the tree asunder, and striking contrast between his glorious athletic achievements and his sudden ignoble death.<ref name="Larmour" />

===Feats of strength===
Anecdotes about Milo's almost superhuman strength and lifestyle abound.  His daily diet allegedly consisted of 20&nbsp;lb of meat, 20&nbsp;lb of bread, and eighteen pints of wine.<ref name="Harris" /> [[Pliny the Elder]] and [[Solinus]] both attribute Milo's invincibility in competition to the wrestler's consumption of ''alectoriae'', the gizzard stones of roosters.<ref name="Poliakoff" /><ref name="Beagon">{{cite book |last=Beagon |first=Mary |title=The Elder Pliny on the Human Animal |publisher=Oxford University Press |date=2005 |page=266 |isbn=0-19-815065-2 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=kwJAyfxkudMC&pg=PA266&dq=Pliny+Natural+History+Milon&lr=lang_en&num=100&as_brr=3&as_pt=BOOKS&ie=ISO-8859-1&output=html |accessdate=2009-04-03}}</ref>  Legends say he carried his own bronze statue to its place at Olympia, and once carried a four-year-old bull on his shoulders before slaughtering, roasting, and devouring it in one day.<ref name="Poliakoff" /><ref name="Harris" />  

One report says the wrestler was able to hold a pomegranate without damaging it while challengers tried to pry his fingers from it, and another report says he could burst a band fastened around his brow by inhaling air and causing the temple veins to swell.  He was said to maintain his footing on an oiled discus while others tried to push him from it.<ref name="Poliakoff" /><ref name="Harris" />  These feats have been attributed to misinterpretations of statues depicting Milo with his head bound in victor's ribbons, his hand holding the apple of victory, and his feet positioned on a round disc that would have been fitted into a pedestal or base.<ref name="Harris" />

While one report says Milo held his arm outstretched and challengers were unable to bend his fingers, another anecdote recorded by [[Claudius Aelianus]] dispels Milo's reputation for enormous strength. Apparently,  Milo challenged a peasant named Titormus to a trial of strength.  Titormus proclaimed he had little strength, but lifted a boulder to his shoulders, carried it several meters and dropped it. Milo was unable to lift it.<ref>{{cite book |last=Harris |first=Harold Arthur |title=Sport in Greece and Rome |publisher=Cornell University Press |location=Ithaca, NY |page=143 |date=1972 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=IJytuwyqKgcC&pg=PA143&dq=Milo+Croton&lr=lang_en&num=100&as_brr=3&as_pt=ALLTYPES&ie=ISO-8859-1&output=html |accessdate=2009-02-27}}</ref>

===Death===
The ancient Greeks typically attributed remarkable deaths to famous persons in keeping with their characters.<ref name="Poliakoff" />  The date of Milo's death is unknown, but according to [[Strabo]] and [[Pausanias]], Milo was walking in a forest when he came upon a tree-trunk split with wedges.  In what was probably intended as a display of strength, Milo inserted his hands into the cleft to rend the tree.  The wedges fell from the cleft, and the tree closed upon his hands, trapping him. Unable to free himself, the wrestler was devoured by wolves.<ref name="Spivey" /><ref name="Poliakoff" /><ref name="Harris" />  A modern historian has suggested it is more likely that Milo was traveling alone when attacked by wolves.  Unable to escape, he was devoured and his remains found at the foot of a tree.<ref name="Harris" />

===Modern art and literature===
[[File:Milo of Croton Puget.jpg|thumb|upright|''Milo of Croton'', (Puget, 1682)]]

Milo's legendary strength and death have become the subjects of modern art and literature.  In [[Pierre Puget]]'s ''Milo of Croton'' (1682), the work's themes are the loss of strength with age, and the ephemerality of glory as symbolized by an Olympic trophy lying in the dust.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.louvre.fr/llv/oeuvres/detail_notice_popup.jsp;jsessionid=JyxKvnTCTq4nFZz1KG1FCplYByGJvFvjpYW1GGSVhhhmdn6KdG6n!-1172152832?CONTENT%3C%3Ecnt_id=10134198673226004&CURRENT_LLV_NOTICE%3C%3Ecnt_id=10134198673226004&FOLDER%3C%3Efolder_id=9852723696500822&bmLocale=en |last=Montalbetti |first=Valerie |title=''Milo of Croton'' by Pierre Puget |publisher=Mus<U+00E9>e du Louvre |accessdate=2009-02-27}}</ref>

[[<U+00C9>tienne-Maurice Falconet]]'s marble ''Milo of Croton'' (1754) secured his admission to the [[Acad<U+00E9>mie des beaux-arts]], but was later criticized for lack of nobility. The work clashed with the classical ideal requiring a dying hero to express stoic restraint.<ref name="Louvre">{{cite web |url=http://www.louvre.fr/llv/oeuvres/detail_notice.jsp?CONTENT%3C%3Ecnt_id=10134198673225998&CURRENT_LLV_NOTICE%3C%3Ecnt_id=10134198673225998&FOLDER%3C%3Efolder_id=9852723696500822&fromDept=true&baseIndex=51&bmUID=1189640483766&bmLocale=en |title=Milo of Croton by <U+00C9>tienne-Maurice Falconet |last=Montalbetti |first=Val<U+00E9>rie |publisher=Mus<U+00E9>e du Louvre |accessdate=2009-02-27}}</ref>

Milo was the subject of a bronze by [[Alessandro Vittoria]] circa 1590, and another bronze now standing in [[Holland Park]], [[London]] by an unknown nineteenth century artist.  His death is the subject of an eighteenth century oil on canvas by [[Joseph-Beno<U+00EE>t Suv<U+00E9>e]] and a work by the eighteenth century Irish painter [[James Barry (painter)|James Barry]].

In literature, [[Fran<U+00E7>ois Rabelais]] compares Gargantua's strength to that of Milo's in ''[[Gargantua and Pantagruel]]'', and [[Shakespeare]] refers to "bull-bearing Milo" in Act 2 of ''[[Troilus and Cressida]]''.
