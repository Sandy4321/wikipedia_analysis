== Biography ==

Scheibler was born in Montjoie (today [[Monschau]]) in the [[Prussia]]n [[Province of J<U+00FC>lich-Cleves-Berg]] into a family of textile fabricants.<ref>[http://www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=gr&GSmid=46785965&GRid=13378537& findagrave]</ref> He attended school in Monschau and [[Krefeld]] and received a practical education at his uncle's [[Worsted|Worsted factory]] at [[Verviers]] ([[Belgium]]). In 1839 he worked for [[Cockerill-Sambre]], a wellknown producer of machinery construction at that time.

Because of the riots of the [[Spring of Nations]] in 1848 Scheibler decided to leave Germany and moved to [[Ozorkow]] in [[Congress Poland]], where his uncle Friedrich Schl<U+00F6>sser operated a textile factory since 1816. After Schl<U+00F6>sser's death he became its commercial director.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://books.google.de/books?id=IG3Rp8NAO8EC&pg=PA794&lpg=PA794&dq=karl+wilhelm+scheibler&source=bl&ots=Uddn_skQZA&sig=Hem-Mmlwzb4aQDmRSHD38H8DtJw&hl=de&ei=xuLFSoDwF56MmwPh0pFI&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=8#v=onepage&q=karl%20wilhelm%20scheibler&f=false|title=Deutsche biographische Enzyklop<U+00E4>die|accessdate=2009-10-02 |work= |publisher= Rudolf Vierhaus |year=2007 |date= |language=German}}</ref> Scheibler married Anna n<U+00E9>e Werner, a niece of Schl<U+00F6>sser, on 16 September 1854. In 1852 Scheibler and his partner Julius Schwartz bought a plot at [[<U+0141><U+00F3>d<U+017A>]] and started to build a machinery fabrication. In October 1854 Schwartz sold his share to Scheibler for 10,000 [[Ruble]], making him the sole-owner of the factory.

In 1855 Scheibler founded a spinning mill with 34 frames and a steam engine of 40 [[horsepower]]. In 1857 Scheibler employed 180 labourers and earned a turnover of 305.100 Ruble in 1860. Scheibler made large profit after the cotton prices in Europe increased because of the [[American Civil War]] and sold his stock at triple the price,<ref name=EU>[http://www2.warwick.ac.uk/fac/soc/wie/eubuildit/manufacturing/lodz/scheibler/ EUbuildit]</ref> he became known as the "King of the Cotton and Linen Empires of <U+0141><U+00F3>d<U+017A>".<ref name=Michlic>{{cite web |url=http://www.ces.fas.harvard.edu/publications/docs/pdfs/Michlic.pdf |title=<U+0141><U+00F3>d<U+017A> in the Post-communist Era: In Search of a New Identity|accessdate=2009-10-02 |work=Joanna B.

Scheibler's factory continued to prosper and he bought several smaller mills in the districts of <U+0179>arki and Ksi<U+0119><U+017C>y M<U+0142>yn. After a fire destroyed the factory at Ksi<U+0119><U+017C>y M<U+0142>yn in 1874 Scheibler rebuilt it with 88.000 spindles and built his own "Kingdom" of Ksi<U+0119><U+017C>y M<U+0142>yn with houses for 321 families, a fire station, schools, shops and a hospital<ref name=Michlic/><ref>[http://www.migrationsroute.nrw.de/projekt_vorschlag.php?projekt_id=24 migrationsroute.nrw.de]{{de icon}}</ref> Scheibler was known for his social engagement<ref>[http://gim24pitagora.atspace.com/poland/scheibler.html Biography]</ref> and supported the foundation of a municipal credit association, the Commercial Bank of <U+0141><U+00F3>d<U+017A> (Bank Handlowy) in 1872<ref>[http://www.it.pw.edu.pl/muzeum/data/ap151_info.html History of the Bank Handlowy] {{pl icon}}</ref> as well as the construction of a [[Lutheran]] and a [[Catholic]] Church.<ref>[http://www.lodz.ap.gov.pl/fab7.html Biography at State archive <U+0141><U+00F3>d<U+017A>] {{pl icon}}</ref>
