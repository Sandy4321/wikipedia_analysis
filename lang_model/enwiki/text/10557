'''Saint Ignatius' College, Riverview''' is a [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] [[day school]] and [[boarding school]] for boys, aged between 10 - 18 years.<ref name="Saint Ignatius' College, Riverview Website"> [http://www.riverview.nsw.edu.au/h_main.php "Saint Ignatius' College, Riverview Website"], (retrieved 06 June 2006).</ref> A [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] school in the tradition of [[Saint|St]] [[Ignatius of Loyola]], it is situated on the [[Lane Cove River]] in [[Sydney]]'s North Shore. Founded in 1880 by Fr. Joseph Dalton, SJ, of the [[Society of Jesus]], it is part of the international network of Jesuit schools begun in Messina, [[Sicily]] in 1548. The college is a member of the [[Athletic Association of the Greater Public Schools of New South Wales]].

== History ==
[[Image:SICRFromNorthEast.JPG|thumb| Wallace Wing, Main Building, Middle School from First Field]]
Following Archbishop [[Roger Bede Vaughan|Roger William Bede Vaughan]] [[Order of St Benedict|OSB]]'s invitation to the Jesuits to Sydney on condition that they found a boys' boarding school and the bequest of Fr John Joseph Therry, who, on his death in 1864 left the greater part of his property to the Society of Jesus, Fr Joseph Dalton [[Society of Jesus|SJ]] concluded arrangements for the purchase of the Riverview property on [[28 June]], [[1878]]. Dalton became founding Rector of the college.

Its first students were brought to the school as advertised in the Catholic newspaper ''The Express'', whereby boys aged between 8 and 12 would be received at Riverview 'as soon as possible after the Christmas holidays'. Classes commenced in the cottage in February 1880.

The original cottage became very cramped with greater numbers and in order to provide better accommodation [[St Michael]]'s House was built. The building was designed by W W Wardell and opened on the feast of [[Saint Michael]], [[29 September]], [[1880]]. In 1882 a wooden boatshed was built for [[sport rowing|rowing]] and in 1883 the [[Infirmary]] took shape.

In its early years the College offered 'Classical and [[Modern Languages]], [[History]], [[Mathematics]], the [[Natural Sciences]] and all other branches required for the [[Civil Service]], the Junior, Senior and [[Matriculation]] Examinations', along with a modern touch - mercantile subjects.

By December 1882, with an enrolment of only 70 students, the College extended the curriculum to include English Composition, [[Writing]], [[Music]], [[Singing]], [[Drawing]], [[Painting]], [[Irish History]] and Oral [[Latin]]. 

Lessons were taught six days a week. Prayers began the day at 6.15 am, followed by [[Catholic Mass|Mass]] and [[study]] before [[breakfast]] at 8.30 am and concluded with night prayers at 8.30pm. On Sundays and [[holidays]] the boys were allowed to [[sleep]] in until 6.30am.

Within seven years of its founding, keen observers were taking notice. In 1887, James Francis Hogan wrote in ''The Irish in Australia'' that 
:"[[St John's College, University of Sydney|St. John's College]], affiliated to the [[University of Sydney]]; St. Ignatius' College, Riverview, conducted by the Jesuit Fathers; and [[St. Joseph's College, Hunters Hill|St. Joseph's College, Hunter Hill]] (sic), under the management of the [[Marist Fathers]], are three educational institutions that reflect the highest credit on the Catholic population of the parent colony."<ref name="The Irish in Australia"> Hogan, James Francis, ''[http://gutenberg.net.au/ebooks05/0500661.txt The Irish in Australia]'', 1887. Reproduced by [[Project Gutenberg]] (retrieved [[15 June]] [[2006]]).</ref>

The main building of the College was constructed in three stages between 1885-1930 and the foundation stone was laid by Cardinal Moran, Archbishop of Sydney on [[15 December]], [[1885]]. As originally designed by Gilbert, Dennehy and Tappin, of [[Ballarat]], the building was to be a huge square, representing four identical fronts, but only the South front was completed according to plan due to financial constraints.

The organ in the chapel was built in 1910 at a cost of <U+00A3>460 by Charles Richardson and installed in 1911. By the 1970s the organ was becoming unreliable and the college organist at the time, Peter Meyer, contracted Arthur Jones to rebuild it in 1976.<ref name="Sydney Organ"> ''[http://sydneyorgan.com/Riverview.html St Ignatius' College Chapel]'', Sydney Organ, (retrieved [[22 October]] [[2006]]).</ref>

Although the first dayboys were not officially admitted until 1923, there was a small group of pupils who were permitted to attend the college as dayboys. In fact, up until the 1960s dayboys remained relatively small in number and Riverview was mainly for boarders.

In the lead up to the 2003 [[Iraq war]], the three school captains wrote a strongly worded letter to the Prime Minister, [[John Howard]], calling for a withdrawal of [[Australian Army|Australian troops]] from the [[Persian Gulf]] and for a non-military solution. They told Mr Howard a poll of 574 students at the College showed 75 per cent were against Australian military participation in Iraq, regardless of the [[The UN Security Council and the Iraq war|United Nations]]<U+2019> position.<ref>{{cite news |first=Gerard | last=Noonan | title=Truants or not, many school students to rally against invasion | date=[[February 28]], 2003 (retrieved 21 June 2006) | publisher=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]| url=http://www.agitprop.org.au/nowar/20030228_smh_student_rally.php}}</ref>

During February 2005, students sang for [[Pope John Paul II]] outside his hospital in [[Rome]] as part of the 2005 ''Pilgrimage of Hope''. The students had previously met the [[Anglican]] [[Archbishop of Canterbury]] [[Rowan Williams]], meditated in [[Assisi]], and worked the streets and orphanages of [[Calcutta]] with [[Mother Teresa]]'s [[Missionaries of Charity]].<ref>{{cite news |first=Matthew | last=Thompson | title=John Paul becomes schoolboys' audience | date=[[February 4]], [[2005]] (retrieved 22 October 2006) | publisher=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]| url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/World/John-Paul-becomes-schoolboys-audience/2005/02/03/1107409989777.html}}</ref>

The year 2005 saw Riverview play host to a series of 125th Anniversary celebrations culminating in a whole school mass at [[St Mary's Cathedral, Sydney]] on the feast of [[Ignatius of Loyola|Ignatius]], July 31.

==Motto and Mission==

Riverview, as the school is frequently referred to, aims to teach students so that they may become young men of competence, conscience and compassion, striving always for excellence in all they do. Its motto, ''Quantum Potes Tantum Aude'', 'As much as you can do, so much dare to do' (formerly 'Dare to do your Best') is taken from a song of [[Saint]] [[Thomas Aquinas]] (1227-1274) entitled ''Lauda Sion Salvatorem''<ref name="Lauda Sion Salvatorem"> Aquinas, Thomas, ''[http://www.preces-latinae.org/thesaurus/Hymni/LaudaSion.html Lauda Sion Salvatorem]'', Latin and English translation (retrieved [[06 June]] 2006).</ref> ('Praise, O Sion, Praise Thy Saviour'). The next line after ''Quantum Potes Tantum Aude'' is ''Quia Maior Omni Laude'', which, together, translates to 'As much as you can do, so much dare to do, because He is above all praise'<ref name="125th Anniversary St Ignatius Day Mass 2005 Homily"> Raper, Mark, ''[http://info.jesuit.org.au/info/modules.php?name=News&file=article&sid=401 125th Anniversary St Ignatius Day Mass 2005 Homily]'', [[St Mary's Cathedral, Sydney]], 31 July 2005 (retrieved 06 June 2006).</ref>, an elegant reflection of a central theme of Jesuit education.

==Jesuit Education==

Jesuit education aims at individual care and concern for each student.<ref name="Jesuit Education: Society of Jesus Education Documents"> Kolvenbach, Peter Hans, ''[http://www.sjweb.info/education/doclist.cfm Jesuit Education: Society of Jesus Education Documents]'' (retrieved [[12 June]] 2006).</ref> Riverview has developed an academic program and [[Pastoral Care]] system, which seeks to enable each boy to reach his full potential as a person of [[faith]], [[Creation (theology)|created]] and [[Deus Caritas Est|loved]] by [[God]].

Society of Jesus Superior General [[Peter Hans Kolvenbach]] wrote in ''The Characteristics of Jesuit Education'' that the "ideal is the well-rounded person who is intellectually competent, open to growth, religious, loving and committed to doing [[justice]] in generosity to the people of [[God]]." <ref name="The Characteristics of Jesuit Education (1986)">Kolvenbach, Peter Hans, ''The Characteristics of Jesuit Education'', 1986.</ref>

Riverview's sister Jesuit schools include [[St Aloysius' College]] in [[Sydney]], [[Saint Ignatius' College, Adelaide]] in Athelstone and [[Xavier College]] in [[Melbourne]] along with the 'Ignatian' Sydney school [[Loyola College, Mount Druitt]].<ref name="The Characteristics of Jesuit Education in Australia - Mission, Governance and Directions"> Raper, Mark, ''[http://info.jesuit.org.au/info/modules.php?name=News&file=article&sid=496#_ftnref1 The Characteristics of Jesuit Education in Australia - Mission, Governance and Directions]'', 'Australian Province Education Ministry Conference', [[Anglesea, Victoria|Anglesea]], 27 April 2006 (retrieved [[12 June]] 2006).</ref>

== [[Prayer]] of [[Ignatius of Loyola|St. Ignatius]]==
[[Image:Main Building, St Ignatius College.jpg|thumb|Statue of the [[Sacred Heart]] in Rose Garden; Main Building]]

Students and teachers pray the Prayer of St. Ignatius at all assemblies and at the beginning of each day:

:Dearest Lord,

Teach me to be generous,<br/>
Teach me to serve you as you deserve,<br/>
To give and not to count the cost,<br/>
To fight and not to heed the wounds,<br/>
To toil and not to seek for rest,<br/>
To labour and not to ask reward,<br/>
Save that of knowing I do your holy will,

:Saint Ignatius,
Pray For Us.

Amen

=== [[Ad maiorem Dei gloriam|Ad Maiorem Dei Gloriam]] === 
[[Image:SICRStatueofStIgnatiusUpright.JPG|thumb|right|AMDG: Statue of St Ignatius below Ramsay Hall]]

It is a longstanding practice that students at the school write [[Ad maiorem Dei gloriam|A.M.D.G.]] in the top left hand corner of any piece of work they do. This stands for ''Ad Maiorem Dei Gloriam'' which means ''To The Greater Glory Of God'': a central theme of [[Jesuit]] Philosophy. Traditionally, at the end of a piece of work they wrote '''L.D.S.''' in the centre of the page, a practice which is no longer widespread. This stands for ''Laus Deo Semper'' which means ''Praise to God Always'', another traditional Jesuit motto.

== House System ==

The House System was established in 1983 to improve the quality of care for students. There are twelve Houses, each consisting of approximately 80 boys from Years 9-12, with a Housemaster and five tutors in each House. Housemasters are concerned with the academic and pastoral development of boys under their care. In so doing, the House System at Riverview aims to develop the "well-rounded person", as Fr [[Peter Hans Kolvenbach]] [[Society of Jesus|SJ]] emphasised in the "Characteristics of Jesuit Education":
:"In a Jesuit School the atmosphere is one in which all can live and work together in understanding and love, with respect for all men and women as Children of God. Jesuit Education insists on individual care and concern for each person...''Cura Personalis'' (concern for the individual person) remains a basic characteristic of Jesuit Education".

From an initial eight Houses in 1983, four more were added in 1997 to reflect the growth in the student population. These Houses were Chisholm, Dalton, Gonzaga and MacKillop. The twelve houses, their patron and motto are:
*Campion House - St [[Edmund Campion]] [[Society of Jesus|SJ]], (1539-1581) - ''Duco Exemplo'': 'I Lead by example'.
*Cheshire House - Group Captain Sir [[Leonard Cheshire]], [[Victoria Cross|VC]], OM, DSO, DFC - ''Dare Est Augere'': 'To Give is to Grow'.
*Chisholm House - [[Caroline Chisholm]] (1808-1877) - ''Agite Iuste, Amate Tenere, Ambulate Humiliter'': 'Act Justly, love tenderly, walk humbly'.
*Claver House - St [[Peter Claver]] [[Society of Jesus|SJ]], (1581-1654) - ''Esurivi et Dedistis'': 'I was hungry and you gave'.
*Dalton House - Fr Joseph Dalton [[Society of Jesus|SJ]], (1817-1905) - ''Felix Faustumque'': 'Blessed and Fortunate'.
*Gonzaga House - St [[Aloysius Gonzaga]] [[Society of Jesus|SJ]], (1568-1591) - ''Altiora Peto'': 'I seek higher things'.
*MacKillop House - Blessed [[Mary MacKillop]], (1842-1909) - ''Contendite cum Virtue'': 'Challenge with Courage'.
*More House - St [[Thomas More]], (1477-1535) - ''Deus Dabit'': 'God will give'.
*Owen House - St [[Nicholas Owen]] [[Society of Jesus|SJ]], (d.1606) - ''Humiliter et Fideliter'': 'Humbly and Faithfully'.
*Ricci House - Fr [[Matteo Ricci]] [[Society of Jesus|SJ]], (1552-1610) - ''Audere Egregia'': 'Dare to be different'.
*Southwell House - St [[Robert Southwell]] [[Society of Jesus|SJ]], (1560-1595) - ''Fidens et Fidelis'': 'True to his Faith'.
*Xavier House - St [[Francis Xavier]] [[Society of Jesus|SJ]], (1506-1552) - ''Sursum Corda'': 'Lift up your hearts'.

Houses meet each Tuesday for a 'Mini-House Meeting' where weekend sport and procedural matters are discussed for fifteen minutes. They also meet once every three weeks for a 50 minute long 'House Meeting' where the student leadership of year 12 run pre-planned activities.

Each House is divided into five tutor groups made up of students from years 9-12. Approximately three students from each of these year groups are in every tutor group, led by a senior teacher. Tutor Groups meet after recess three times per week for fifteen minutes and engage in a range of activities, culminating in a biannual tutor group outing.

==Boarding==
[[Image:SICRAwayStandKFHouse.JPG|thumb|right|Kevin Fagan House behind First Field's Away Grandstand]]
With a boarding student population of 350, Riverview is one of the largest boarding schools in [[New South Wales]]. Officially a boarding only school until the 1920s, the Day Boys remained a small minority until the late 1960s. The College now has a majority of day-boys.

A number of [[dormitories|Boarding Houses]] and [[refectories]] ('refs') are located on the College grounds. There is a junior refectory for years 6-11 and a senior refectory for year 12 (rhetoric) and staff members. 

Jesuit schools have always grouped their Boarders horizontally according to age groups, called Divisions. This means that each group of boys to be cared for as a homogenous age group. As a boy progresses from one of the six Divisions to the next, there is a freshness of environment. 

In Junior and Year 8 Divisions, boys have their own cubicle within a dormitory of eight. In Years 9 and 10 Divisions boys may sleep in a room of four or a single room. In Year 11 Division boys share a room while in Year 12 Division have single rooms, with both years being housed within the newly built ''[[Kevin Fagan (doctor)|Kevin Fagan]] House''. Junior and Year 8 Divisions have a separate study area within the division while from Years 9-12 boys study at their own desk in their room.

Boarding fees range from $11 640 Per Annum in year 6 to $12 375 in year 12, in addition to Tuition fees.<ref name="Fees">  ''[http://www.riverview.nsw.edu.au/en_fees.php St Ignatius' College, Riverview Fees]'' (retrieved [[29 July]] 2006).</ref>

There's a lot of kids who want to play AFL and who don't get the chance. The more private schools get involved, the better.

==Preferred Futures==
In 2005, the 125th year of the College, a project of community discussion developed a plan published as ''Riverview 2025: the preferred futures''. A a series of talks by esteemed members of the community canvassed the future of the [[Roman Catholic Church|Church]] and Riverview's place in preparing its students for a changing world. 

The first forum began with journalist [[Geraldine Doogue]] interviewing social commentator [[Hugh Mackay (social researcher)|Hugh Mackay]] on the direction [[Australian]] society is heading. The second address of the night focussed on the youth of Australia and was given by 1998 Young [[Australian of the Year]] [[List of Young Australian of the Year Award recipients|Tan Le]].

The second forum's keynote address was by the Auxiliary Bishop of Sydney, [[Anthony Fisher]] [[Order of Preachers|OP]], Dux of the school in 1977. After an address by member of the [[Human rights in Australia|Human Rights Council of Australia]] Harris Van Beek on the relevance, authenticity and organisational issues of the Church, Bishop Fisher spoke to ''Values and the Future of Church and [[Religion]] as we know it''<ref name="Faith, Ethics and the Future of the Catholic School"> Fisher, Anthony, ''[http://www.sydney.catholic.org.au/People/Bishops/Fisher/200432_1154.shtml Faith, Ethics and the Future of the Catholic School]'', Ramsay Hall, St Ignatius' College, Riverview, 2 March 2004 (retrieved 06 June 2006).</ref>. In this talk he stated that:
:First, Catholic schools must in the future give the teaching of Catholic faith and morals pride of place. <br/>Secondly, the Catholic religion (must) be increasingly visible in our school environment the more invisible it becomes elsewhere in our culture. <br/>Thirdly, Catholic schools will need to integrate...social activism, community service, leadership skilling and teamwork, arts and sciences, with other aspects of Catholic faith and practice and name them precisely as aspects of that Catholic faith and practice rather than compartments of life distinct from it.
[[Image:SICRfromFirstFieldSunset.JPG|thumb|right|College from First Field]]

In the final forum both Geraldine Doogue and headmaster of St Ignatius' College, Adelaide Fr. Greg O<U+2019>Kelly S.J. highlighted the spiritual quest of many people today.  Each presented that the education of the future would need to nurture an enquiring mind in an educational environment that includes reflection.

Discussions on the issues brought up by the talks gathered together over 3000 members of the Riverview community, including students, old boys, Jesuits, and past and present teachers.

The proposals envision students as either male or female; "primary, secondary, tertiary, adult or senior", and call for an on-campus centre for scholarship in teaching and learning. Such a centre would teach the precepts of Jesuit Education and Ignatian Pedagogy, re-energising the laity amidst declining religious vocations. Further, the College would engage in giving its students a series of overseas 'immersion' experiences that reveal the world and the need to act to bring about the [[Ad Maiorem Dei Gloriam|'Greater Glory of God']] within it, perhaps moving to a more vocational leaving certificate such as the [[International Baccalaureate]].

The centre would teach Jesuit bachelor degrees in education and hold residencies for overseas teachers and the staff of other Australian Jesuit schools. As the number of Jesuit staff members at the College declined from over 20 in the 1970s to 4 in 2005, Headmaster Shane Hogan told the [[Sydney Morning Herald]], "we need to go into teaching education ... if there's no one here to influence (the students) when they get here, then they might as well be teachers from anywhere."<ref>{{cite news |first=Matthew | last=Thompson | title= St Ignatius toys with allowing girls as Jesuits fade away | date=February 4, 2005 (retrieved 06 June 2006) | publisher=The Sydney Morning Herald | url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/National/St-Ignatius-toys-with-allowing-girls-as-Jesuits-fade-away/2005/02/03/1107409987997.html}}</ref> <ref>{{cite news |first= | last= | title=Sydney Jesuit school considers female students | date=[[February 04]], 2005 (retrieved 21 June 2006) | publisher=Catholic News | url=http://www.cathnews.com/news/502/28.php}}</ref>

For Bishop Fisher, the College will need to succeed "in communicating a fully human, Ignatian, Catholic vision", so that it, amidst widespread [[atheism]], can "demonstrate that it has (something) to say that the world does not already know".

==Old Ignatians Union==
The Old Ignatians Union or 'OIU', established in 1897, has a mission to "sustain and strengthen the connection between Old Ignatians' and to further the interests of the College".<ref name="Old Ignatians Union Homepage"> [http://www.oiu.org.au/ "Old Ignatians Union Homepage"] <U+2014> (retrieved 21 June 2006).</ref> Reunions and fundraisers are held to help the Development Office fundraise [[bursary|bursaries]].
