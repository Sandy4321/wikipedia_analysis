The '''Royal Chapel of St Katherine-upon-the-Hoe''' is a church within the [[Royal Citadel, Plymouth|Royal Citadel]] in [[Plymouth]]. The original church on the site was licensed for services by the [[Bishop of Exeter]], [[Thomas de Brantingham]], in 1371. During the period 1666-1671, this building was demolished and the present nave, chancel and sanctuary were rebuilt on the same site. The galleries and [[transept]]s were added in 1845 and give a cross-like structure to the building. 

King [[George V of the United Kingdom|George V]] re-granted the title ''Royal Chapel'' in 1927 during a visit to the Royal Citadel.

It is the Garrison Church to the [[Royal Marines]] in Plymouth
