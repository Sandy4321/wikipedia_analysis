'''Sajmi<U+0161>te concentration camp''' ({{lang-sr-Cyrl|<U+041A><U+043E><U+043D><U+0446><U+0435><U+043D><U+0442><U+0440><U+0430><U+0446><U+0438><U+043E><U+043D><U+0438> <U+043B><U+043E><U+0433><U+043E><U+0440> <U+0421><U+0430><U+0458><U+043C><U+0438><U+0448><U+0442><U+0435>}}) was a [[Nazi concentration camp]], located in the [[Independent State of Croatia]], on the outskirts of [[Belgrade]]. It was established in December 1941 and shut down in September 1944.<ref>The Holocaust: The Fate of European Jewry, 1932-1945 by Yahil, Leny translated by Ina R. Friedman, Haya Galai Oxford University Press US 1990</ref>The majority of [[Serbian Jews]] were killed in the Sajmi<U+0161>te camp.

==Establishment==
In the beginning, Sajmi<U+0161>te was almost exclusively meant for [[Serbs|Serbian]] resistance fighters, [[Serbs|Serbia]]n [[Jews]], and subsequently for Serbian [[Roma (Romani subgroup)|Roma]] and political prisoners. <ref name = Herbert>Herbert, Ulrich C., ''National Socialist Extermination Policies: Contemporary German Perspectives and Controversies'',  p. 178, Berghahn Books 2000</ref>  Even as the murder of male Jews was underway in the fall 1941, the military administration chief, SS-Gruppenfuehrer [[Harold Turner (German SS commander)|Harold Turner]], enacted the first measures for interning Jewish women and children in the Sajmi<U+0161>te concentration camp near Belgrade, reporting to his Nazi bosses:
{{cquote|Preliminary work for Jewish ghetto in Belgrade completed. Following the liquidation of the remaining male Jews, already ordered by the commander in Serbia, the ghetto will contain approximately 10,000 Jewish women and children.<ref>Herbert, at page 178</ref>}}

==Location==
The camp was formed on the left bank of the [[Sava]], near the [[Old Railway Bridge (Belgrade)|railway bridge]] at the entrance into [[Belgrade]] where the pre-war trade fairground (''sajmi<U+0161>te'') was located. This territory which was, at that time, deserted, uninhabited and marshy, was several kilometers from [[Zemun]] and formed a part of NDH ([[Independent State of Croatia]]) territory. The Germans asked the Ustashe (and got their agreement) for having Semlin as a transit camp for the Serbian Jews.<ref>[http://www.nizkor.org/hweb/people/e/eichmann-adolf/transcripts/Sessions/Session-046-01.html The Trial of Adolf Eichmann: Session 46]<br>
I go on to document No. 653, a note from Rademacher to Luther on 8 December 1941. Benzler has come to Berlin from Belgrade and has informed him over the telephone that:<br>"A change has occurred in the plan for the method of dealing with the Serbian Jews; the Jews would no longer be taken to a Serbian island, but to the Semlin camp instead. The island which had been envisaged originally was inundated. The Croats had agreed that the Jews be taken to Semlin as a transit camp. Minister Benzler asked that the Jews be therefore taken East as soon as possible. I replied that this would be out of the question before the spring, because deportation from Germany had priority. Even deportation in the spring was still in doubt."</ref>

==Prisoners==
Most of the inmates were Serbian opponents of the occupation, as well as Serbian [[Romani people]].<ref name=HeerNauman>Heer, Hannes, and Nauman, Klaus, ''War Of Extermination: The German Military In World War II'', p.49, Berghahn Books 2004</ref>The [[Wehrmacht]] claimed that military reasons justified the interning of women and children. Counterintelligence (IC/AO) in [[Saloniki]] reported:
{{cquote|All Jews and Gypsies are being transferred to a concentration camp near Semlin... They are clearly informants for the rebels.<ref>Heer and Nauman, at 49.</ref>}}  

The number of inmates is estimated at 100 000.<ref name=nb>{{cite web|url=http://www.novibeograd.rs/default.asp?jez=l&str=1|title=Istorijat|publisher=Municipality of New Belgrade|language=Serbian|accessdate=2007-09-06}}</ref> At least 40 000 Serbian and 7<U+2013>8 000 Jewish victims perished in Sajmi<U+0161>te concentration camp.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www1.yadvashem.org/odot_pdf/Microsoft%20Word%20-%205988.pdf|title=Sajmiste|publisher=Shoah Resource Center, The International School for Holocaust Studies|}}</ref>

The concentration camp administration had approximately 500 Jewish men who were exempted from shooting. They administered the camp in so-called "self-administration" and were responsible for distributing food, dividing up labor, and organizing a Jewish guard force which patrolled along the barbed wire fence inside the camp.  The camp commandant since January 1942 was SS [[Untersturmf<U+00FC>hrer]] [[Herbert Androfer]].  The camp's exterior was guarded by 25 men of German Reserve Police Battalion 64.<ref>National Socialist Extermination Policies: Contemporary German Perspectives and Controversies by Ulrich C. Herbert Berghahn Books 2000 page 179</ref>

Supplies were provided by the "Department of Social Care and Social Institutions of Belgrade<U+2019>s Municipal Authorities". At the beginning of December 1941, German authorities ordered Jews in Belgrade to report to the [[Sicherheitspolizei]] and to hand over their house keys. From December 8th until 12th, Germans took them to Sajmi<U+0161>te. Conditions in the camp were extremely difficult - the damp and the cold, hunger and epidemics.
As camp inmates starved and froze to death, Jewish men (the number is unknown) were led away to be shot by German firing squads in Belgrade. They were killed in the same manner, in the same place and by the same people as were the [[Banjica concentration camp|Banjica camp]] prisoners. After all men were shot, 6,280 women and children were killed in a special gas truck on their way to Belgrade and buried in [[Jajinci]].

The ''[[Encyclopedia of the Holocaust]]'' states:
{{cquote|Mass murders of Jews took place in Jajinci, Jabuka, Zasavica (near <U+0160>abac), and [[Bubanj]] (near Ni<U+0161>). By December, most of the Jewish men had been killed; the rest - a group from Ni<U+0161>, and several hundred men had been put to work in the Sajmi<U+0161>te camp, near Belgrade, were murdered in February and March 1942, respectively.<ref name = HolocaustEncyclopedia>''Encyclopedia of the Holocaust'', Macmillan Publishing Company
New York 1990</ref>}}

On October 20, 1941, Turner attended meeting with other Nazi officials including Security Police [[Sicherheitspolizei|''Sicherheitspolizei'']] chief [[Wilhelm Fuchs]], [[Franz Rademacher]] (in charge of Jewish affairs at the German Foreign Ministry, and two men from [[Adolf Eichmann|Adolf Eichmann's]] office, [[Franz Stuschke]] and [[SS-Obersturmbannf<U+00FC>hrer]] [[Friedrich Suhr]].  These men decided to arrest all the Jews in Serbia and imprison them at Sajmi<U+0161>te concentration camp, and thereafter to transport them to the east (presumably to be murdered) once transport became available, which would not be before the summer of 1942.  Pursuant to this plan, between December 1941 and February 1942, all Jewish women and children in Serbia (7500 to 8000 people) were taken to the Sajmi<U+0161>te camp. Bad food and completely inadequate shelter and sanitary conditions (for example, there was a single shower for all the prisoners) killed large numbers of people.<ref name = HolocaustEncyclopedia/>

==Mass killings by gas van==
[[Image:Chelmno Gas Van.jpg|thumb|[[Gas van]] used by Nazis for murders at [[Chelmno extermination camp]] in Poland.]]
Turner and the other Nazis responsible for the camp did not care of course how many people died, because the plan was to murder all the people in the east anyway, and the more that did not need to be transported the easier it would be to kill the survivors.  However, as it turned out, it wasn't possible to transport the people as early as Turner and the others had hoped, and so a decision was made to kill the people at the camp in Serbia.  The means by which this would be done would be [[carbon monoxide]] poisoning, with the exhaust from [[internal combustion engine|internal combustion engines]].  Accordingly, the camp authorities arranged with their masters in [[Berlin]] to have a [[gas van]] sent out to Belgrade.  (Gas vans had already been used in Poland and other places to murder people.)  From March to May 1942, the Nazis used the gas van to kill all the Jews imprisoned in Sajmi<U+0161>te.  This accounted for almost all the Jews in Serbia.  (Of the Serbian Jewish population of 16,000, the Nazis murdered approximately 14,500.)  Most of the survivors were either being hidden by Serbian friends or had joined the Partisans.<ref name = HolocaustEncyclopedia/>

==Destruction of the evidence==
{{main|Sonderaktion 1005}}
In November 1943 SS-[[Standartenf<U+00FC>hrer]] [[Paul Blobel]], the officer in charge of [[Aktion 1005]] (later executed for his numerous crimes against humanity) came to Belgrade to organize the destruction of the evidence of the Nazi crimes at Sajmi<U+0161>te concentration camp.  This plan, devised by [[Heinrich Himmler]] when the war turned against Germany, was to disinter and burn the bodies of the murder victims. Blobel organized a unit of fifty [[Sicherheitspolizei]] and German military police, and 100 Jewish and Serbian prisoners to carry out this gruesome task.<ref name = HolocaustEncyclopedia/>  Similar actions were undertaken at about the same time at other locations where the Nazis had murdered and buried large numbers of people, for example, at [[Rumbula massacre|Rumbula]] in Latvia and [[Belzec extermination camp]] in Poland.


== Aftermath ==
[[File:Spomenik na Sajmistu.jpg|thumb|Memorial to the honour of Sajmi<U+0161>te victims]]
In 1944, Sajmi<U+0161>te was hit by U.S. bombers in raids, which killed 80 people at the camp and injured 170. The bombers' intended target was the nearby railway station.

Sajmi<U+0161>te is still not a memorial center. The location is proclaimed a "Cultural Heritage of city of Belgrade" in 1987, and a monument was erected on [[April 21]] [[1995]].<ref name=nb/> A campaign to create a memorial center was initiated in April 2006.{{Fact|date=September 2007}}
