'''Norborne Berkeley, 4th Baron Botetourt''' (c. 1717 &ndash; 15 October 1770), was a [[courtier]], [[member of parliament]], and [[royal governor]] of the [[colony of Virginia]] from 1768 until his death in 1770.

==Life==
Norborne Berkeley was born about 1717. He was of the family of Berkeley of [[Stoke Gifford]] in Gloucestershire, descended from Maurice de Berkeley (d. 1347), who had acquired the manor of Stoke Gifford in 1337, the second son of [[Maurice de Berkeley, 2nd Baron Berkeley]] (1271<U+2013>1326). In 1726, Berkeley was admitted to [[Westminster School]].  

His political career began in 1741 when he was elected to the [[House of Commons of Great Britain|House of Commons]] as a [[knight of the shire]] for [[Gloucestershire (UK Parliament constituency)|Gloucestershire]], a seat he held until 1763.  Considered a staunch [[Tory]], Berkeley's fortunes were boosted considerably on the accession of George III in 1760, when he was appointed a [[Groom of the Bedchamber]] and in 1762 (until 1766) [[Lord Lieutenant of Gloucestershire]]. In 1764, he successfully claimed the title of [[Baron Botetourt]] as the lineal descendant of Maurice de Berkeley (d. 1361) and his wife Catherine de Botetourt, sister & co-heir of John Botetourt, son and heir of [[John de Botetourt, 1st Baron Botetourt|Sir John de Botetourt]] (d. 1324), baron by writ 1309-15. Maurice (d. 1361) was the son and heir of Maurice de Berkeley (d. 1347 at the [[Siege of Calais (1346)|Siege of Calais]]), who had acquired the manor of [[Stoke Gifford]], Gloucestershire, in 1337, the second son of [[Maurice de Berkeley, 2nd Baron Berkeley]] (1271<U+2013>1326). He thus took a seat in the [[House of Lords]] as the 4th Baron de Botetourt, and in 1767 was appointed a [[Gentleman of the Bedchamber|Lord of the Bedchamber]] for life and in 1768 [[Governor of Virginia]].  

He died in [[Williamsburg, Virginia|Williamsburg]] on 15 October 1770, after an illness lasting several weeks. Botetourt never married and left no direct heirs.<ref>Sir Lewis Namier and John Brooke, eds., ''The House of Commons, 1754-1790'', vol. 2 (1985), pp. 85-86</ref><ref>G. F.

==Statues==
A statue of Botetourt was placed in the Capitol in Williamsburg in 1773. The Capital of Colonial Virginia was located in Williamsburg from 1699 until 1780, but at the urging of Governor [[Thomas Jefferson]] was moved to [[Richmond, Virginia|Richmond]] for security reasons during the [[American Revolution]]. In 1801 the statue of Botetourt was acquired by the [[College of William and Mary]] and moved to the campus from the former Capitol building. Barring a brief period during the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] when it was moved to the [[Eastern State Hospital (Virginia)|Public Asylum]] for safety, it stood in the College Yard until 1958 when it was removed for protection from the elements, and then in 1966 was installed in the new [[Swem Library|Earl Gregg Swem Library]], in the new Botetourt Gallery. In 1993, as the College celebrated its [[tercentenary]], a new [[bronze]] statue of Botetourt by the William and Mary alumnus [[Gordon Kray]] was installed in the College Yard in front of the [[Wren Building]], in the place occupied for generations by the original.<ref>[http://www.wm.edu/about/wren/wrenchapel/htmls/botetourthistory.html]</ref>

==Legacy==
[[Botetourt County, Virginia]], was named in Botetourt's honour. Historians also believe that [[Berkeley County, West Virginia]], and the town of [[Bath (Berkeley Springs), West Virginia|Berkeley Springs]], both now in [[West Virginia]], were also named in his honour, or possibly that of another popular colonial governor, [[William Berkeley (governor)|Sir William Berkeley]].<ref>[http://www.berkeleysprings.com/walkingtour/introduction.html berkeleysprings.com]</ref>

[[Lord Botetourt High School]] in the unincorporated town of [[Daleville, Virginia|Daleville]] in Botetourt County, Virginia, is also named for him, as is the Botetourt Dorm Complex at [[The College of William and Mary]]. Two statues also adorn the campus of [[The College of William and Mary]]. [[Gloucester County, Virginia]] has an elementary school named for governor.  Both [[Richmond, Virginia]] and [[Norfolk, Virginia]] have streets named in his honour.
