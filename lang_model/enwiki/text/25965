'''Richard Clive Desmond''' (born [[8 December]], [[1951]]) is a [[United Kingdom|British]] [[publisher]], current owner of Express Newspapers and founder of Northern and Shell plc. Express Newspapers publishes the ''[[Daily Express]]'', ''[[Sunday Express]]'', ''[[Daily Star Sunday]]'' and ''[[Daily Star]]''. Northern and Shell was notorious for publishing dozens of  [[pornography|pornographic]] titles, such as ''Big Ones'', ''Skinny and Wriggly'', ''Forum'',  ''Posh Housewives'' and ''[[Asian Babes]]'', prior to their sale to [[Remnant Media]] in [[2004]].  Despite selling his magazines, he is still the owner of the most popular pornographic television channels in the UK, the [[Television X|Fantasy Channel]] and [[Red Hot TV]].

==Personal life==
From a [[Jew]]ish background, Desmond grew up in north [[London]] and left school at 14. His first job was for Thomson Newspapers, working in classified advertisements. He moved on to another company and by the age of 21 owned two record shops. He acquired an interest in publishing and in 1974 published a magazine called ''International Musician''. 

He is prominent in several Jewish charitable institutions and in 2006 was appointed to head [[Norwood (charity)|Norwood]], which is devoted to helping children in need.  The appointment caused considerable controversy, but was defended by Rabbi Jeremy Rosen.<ref name="Norwood">{{cite news | url=http://www.somethingjewish.co.uk/articles/1916_richard_desmond.htm title=Richard Desmond | publisher=somethingjewish.com | date=June 6, 2006}}</ref>

Desmond currently lives in [[north London]].

==Publishing career==
In [[1983]] he published a British version of the American pornographic magazine ''[[Penthouse (magazine)|Penthouse]]''. Northern & Shell was the first company to move to the revamped [[London Docklands|Docklands]] and the [[Anne, Princess Royal|Princess Royal]] opened the offices. When the company moved to the Northern & Shell Tower [[Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh|Prince Philip]] did the honours. Desmond's biggest publishing deal was the launch of celebrity magazine ''[[OK!]]'' in [[1993]].

Desmond attracted controversy over his <U+00A3>100,000 donation to the [[The Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]].<ref name="donate">{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/world_at_one/1984701.stm | title=Blair faces backlash over Desmond donation | publisher=BBC | date=May 13, 2002}}</ref> Several prominent Labour members, including [[Clare Short]], broke ranks to question whether the party should be accepting money from a publisher of pornographic magazines.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/2005492.stm | publisher=BBC | title=Desmond donation wrong - minister | date=May 24, 2002}}</ref>

After buying Express Newspapers in 2000 for <U+00A3>125m,<ref name="profile">{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/3479581.stm | title=Profile: Richard Desmond | author=Jorn Madslien | date=February 12, 2006 | publisher=BBC}}</ref> Desmond became embroiled in a bitter feud with [[Harold Jonathan Esmond Vere Harmsworth, 4th Viscount Rothermere|Viscount Rothermere]], publisher of the ''[[Daily Mail]]'', the  rival of the ''Daily Express'', largely derived from stories relating to Rothermere's private life. The ''Daily Mail'' ran several articles describing Desmond as a pornographer and ''[[Private Eye]]'' christened him "Dirty Desmond". ''Mail'' editor [[Paul Dacre]], despite an eventual truce between the competitors, commented on Demond in the ''[[British Journalism Review]]'' (2002):
{{cquote|Richard Desmond is an appalling man. He is bad for British journalism. He<U+2019>s bad for public life and he<U+2019>s bad for civilized standards. For [[Tony Blair|Tony]] and [[Cherie Blair]] to court him so assiduously speaks volumes for their moral elasticity. As long as I<U+2019>ve got energy in my body, I<U+2019>m going to devote everything to try to see him off.<ref>Bill Hagerty [http://www.bjr.org.uk/data/2002/no3_hagerty2.htm "Paul Dacre: the zeal thing",] ''British Journalism Review'', Vol. 13, No. 3, 2002, pages 11-22. Retrieved on 25 May 2007.</ref>}}

In April 2004, the ''Daily Express'' shifted its support from Labour to the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservatives]]. On the same day Desmond caused a scandal by accusing the ''[[Daily Telegraph]]'', which was then considering accepting a takeover offer by the [[Germany|German]] [[Axel Springer]] group, of giving in to [[Nazism|Nazis]].<ref name="nazi">{{cite news | url=http://media.guardian.co.uk/site/story/0,14173,1200881,00.html | title= Desmond taunts Telegraph in 'Nazi' tirade  | publisher=Guardian | work=Media Guardian | date=April 22, 2004}}</ref> Desmond reportedly harangued ''The Daily Telegraph'''s chief executive and associates in faux German at a business meeting and imitated [[Adolf Hitler]], before erupting in a tirade of four-letter words.<ref name="nazi" />
