'''Mamucium''' was a [[castra|fort]] in the [[Roman province]] of [[Britannia]]. It is also known as '''Mancunium'''.<ref name="PRB">{{cite book |last=Rivet |first=A L F |coauthors=Smith, Colin |title=The Place-Names of Roman Britain |publisher=B T Batsford |date=1979 |location=London}}</ref> The remains of the fort are protected as a [[Scheduled Ancient Monument]], and are located within the [[Castlefield]] area of the [[Manchester|City of Manchester]], in [[North West England]] ({{gbmapping|SJ833977}}).<ref>{{cite web |title=Mamucium |url=http://www.pastscape.org.uk/hob.aspx?hob_id=76731 |publisher=Pastscape.org.uk}} Retrieved on 29&nbsp;December 2007.</ref> Founded c.&nbsp;AD&nbsp;79, Mamucium was garrisoned by a cohort of auxiliary soldiers and guarded the road running from [[Chester]] to [[York]]. A ''[[vicus]]'', or civilian settlement made up of traders and the families of the soldiers, grew outside the fort and was an area of industrial activity.

The site lay in ruins until the [[Industrial Revolution]]. During this period Manchester expanded and the fort was levelled to make way for new developments. It was also damaged by the construction of the [[Rochdale Canal]] and the [[Great Northern Railway (Great Britain)|Great Northern Railway]]. The site is now part of the regenerated area of warehousing alongside the Rochdale Canal, part of the Castlefield Urban Heritage Park. Reconstructed remains of the fort's gatehouse, granaries, and some buildings from the ''vicus'' are on display to the public.

==Location==
When the Roman fort in Castlefield was built, it was located on a naturally defensible [[sandstone]] [[bluff]], guarding a nearby crossing over the [[River Medlock]].<ref name="Gregory1">Gregory (2007), p.&nbsp;1.</ref> The fort was situated near a junction between at least two [[Roman road]]s. It guarded the road between the [[legion|legionary]] fortresses of [[Deva Victrix]] (Chester) and [[Eboracum]] (York) running east to west, as well as the road between Manchester and [[Bremetennacum]] ([[Ribchester]]) to the north.<ref>Gregory (2007), pp.&nbsp;1<U+2013>2.</ref> In addition, Mamucium may also have overlooked a lesser road running north west to [[Coccium]] ([[Wigan]]).<ref name="Gregory2">Gregory (2007), p.&nbsp;2.</ref> The fort was one of a chain of fortifications along the Eboracum to Deva Victrix road, with [[Castleshaw Roman fort]] lying {{convert|16|mi|km|lk=on}} to the east,<ref>Walker (1999), p.&nbsp;15.</ref> and [[Northwich#Roman Northwich|Condate]] ([[Northwich]]) {{convert|18|mi}} to the west. Stamps on [[Imbrex and tegula|tegulae]] indicate that Mamucium had administrative links not only with Castleshaw, the nearest fort, but also those at Slack and [[Ebchester]]; all the forts probably got the tegulae from the same place in Grimescar Wood near [[Huddersfield]].<ref>Walker (1999), p.&nbsp;78.</ref>

The area around where the fort stood has changed greatly in the centuries that followed; the area is surrounded by mills from the [[Industrial Revolution]] and the urbanisation of Manchester encroached on the site and damaged the remains. Castlefield, where the remains of the fort are, is on the south west corner of [[Manchester city centre]]. The Rochdale Canal cuts through the southern corner of the fort.<ref name="Gregory2"/> [[Deansgate]], which has developed into a busy thoroughfare, passes close to the east of the fort and follows the general line of Roman road to Ribchester and [[Castlefield]]. <ref name="Gregory2"/>

==History==
Although there is no evidence of prehistoric settlement, there is evidence of activity in the area. A [[Neolithic]] [[scraper (archaeology)|scraper]], two [[Mesolithic]] [[flint tool|flints]] and a flint [[lithic flake|flake]] have been discovered, as well as a shard of late [[Bronze Age]] pottery; however these were mostly not found [[in situ]].<ref name="Gregory181">Gregory (2007), p.&nbsp;181.</ref> Although the area was in the territory of the [[Celts|Celtic]] tribe [[Brigantes]] until the Romans annexed the area, it may have been under the control of the [[Setantii]], a sub-tribe of the Brigantes.<ref>Kidd (1996), p.&nbsp;12.</ref> The fort was built around 79;<ref name="Gregory3">Gregory (2007), p.&nbsp;3.</ref> it was built as part of the fortifications erected under [[Gnaeus Julius Agricola]] during his campaigns against the Brigantes after the treaty with the Celtic tribe failed.<ref name="mason42">Mason (2001), pp.&nbsp;41<U+2013>42.</ref> The name Mamucium is thought to derive from the Celtic meaning "breast shaped hill", referring to the sandstone bluff the fort stood on; this later evolved into the name Manchester.<ref name="Place names">{{cite book|title=A Dictionary of British Place-Names|url=http://www.oxfordreference.com/pages/Subjects_and_Titles__2B_05|last=Mills|first=A.D.|year=2003|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=0198527586}}</ref> [[Excavation]]s have demonstrated that the fort had three main [[archaeological phase|phases]] of construction; one in 79, the second in 160, and the third in 200.

There is a possible [[Mithraic Mysteries|temple to Mithras]] associated with the civilian settlement,<ref name="guide"/> in modern day [[Hulme]].<ref name="Hylton4"/> An altar dedicated to "Fortune the Preserver" was found, probably dating to the early 3rd century.<ref name="guide"/> In 2008 an altar dating from the late 1st century was discovered near the Roman settlement. It was dedicated to two minor Germanic gods and described as being in "fantastic" condition.<ref>{{cite web |title=Roman soldier's gift found |author=David Ottewell  |url=http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/s/1044666_roman_soldiers_gift_found |publisher=Manchester Evening News |date=10&nbsp;April 2008}} Retrieved on 20&nbsp;July 2008.</ref> The county archaeologist said

As well as Pagan worship, there is also evidence of early Christian worship. In the 1970s a 2nd century [[sator square|"word square"]] was discovered with an anagram of [[Lord's Prayer|PATER NOSTER]].<ref>Shotter (2004), p.&nbsp;129.</ref> There has been discussion by academics whether the "word square", which is carved on a piece of [[amphora]], is actually a Christian artefact, but if it is it is one of the earliest examples of Christianity in Britain.<ref>Shotter (2004), pp.&nbsp;129<U+2013>130.</ref>

The second phase was built around 160. Although it was again of turf and timber construction, it was larger than the previous fort, measuring  {{convert|2|ha|acre}} to accommodate extra granaries (''[[Horreum|horrea]]'').<ref name="Brennand">Philpott (2006), p.&nbsp;66.</ref> Around 200, the gatehouses of the fort were rebuilt in stone and the walls surrounding the fort were given a stone facing.<ref name="Brennand"/> The concentration of furnaces in sheds in part of the ''vicus'' associated with the fort has been described as an "industrial estate",<ref>Shotter (2004), p.&nbsp;117.</ref> which would have been the first in Manchester.  Mamucium was included in the [[Antonine Itinerary]], a 3rd century register of roads throughout the [[Roman Empire]].<ref>Shotter (2004), p.&nbsp;40.</ref> This and inscriptions on and repairs to buildings indicate that Mamucium was still in use in the first half of the 3rd century.<ref>Shotter (2004), p.&nbsp;153.</ref> The ''vicus'' may have been abandoned by the mid 3rd century; this is supported by the excavated remains of some buildings while were demolished and the materials robbed for use elsewhere.<ref name="Gregory190"/> Evidence from coins indicates that although the civilian settlement associated with the fort had declined by the mid 3rd century, a small garrison may have remained at Mamucium into the late 3rd century and early 4th century.<ref name="Gregory190"/>

During the medieval period, the area was used for agricultural purposes.<ref name="Gregory190"/> After lying derelict for centuries, the ruins were commented on by [[antiquarian]]s [[John Leland]] in the 16th century, [[William Camden]] in the late 16th and early 17th centuries, and [[William Stukeley]] in the 18th century.<ref name="Gregory2"/> In the early 18th century, [[John Horsley]] said:

{{quote|It [the fort] is about a quarter of a mile out of the town, being south or south-west from it. The station now goes by the name of Giant's Castle or Tarquin's Castle, and the field in which it stands is called Castle Field ... the ramparts are still very conspicuous.|John Horsley, ''Britannia Romana''<ref name="Hylton3">Hylton (2003), p.&nbsp;3.</ref>}}

The name "Tarquin's Castle" refers to the legend that the fort had been occupied by a giant named Tarquin.<ref name="Hylton3"/>

Mamucium was levelled as Manchester expanded during the Industrial Revolution. With the construction of the Rochdale Canal in the late 18th and early 19th centuries through the south western corner of the fort and the building of viaducts for the Great Northern Railway over the site have damaged the remains and even destroyed some in the southern half of the fort.<ref name="Gregory2"/> When the railway viaducts were built in the late 19th century, Charles Roeder documented the remains of Mamucium that were uncovered in the process including parts of the ''vicus''.<ref name="Gregory2"/>

The first [[archaeology|archaeological]] investigation of Mamucium was in 1906. Francis Bruton, who would later work on the Roman fort at [[Castleshaw]], [[excavated]] the fort's western defences.<ref name="Gregory3"/> A series of small scale excavations were undertaken intermittently  between 1912 and 1967, generally exploring the northern defences of the fort.<ref name="Gregory3"/><ref>{{cite web |title=Mamucium investigation history |url=http://www.pastscape.org.uk/events.aspx?a=0&hob_id=76731 |publisher=Pastscape.org.uk}} Retrieved on 18&nbsp;July 2008.</ref> The first excavation of the ''vicus'' was carried out in the 1970s under [[Barri Jones|Professor Barri Jones]].<ref name="Gregory3"/> In 1982, the fort along with the rest of the Castlefield area became the [[United Kingdom]]'s first Urban Heritage Park.<ref>Woodside et al. (2004), p.&nbsp;286.</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Manchester firsts |author=Manchester City Council |url=http://www.manchester.gov.uk/site/scripts/documents_info.php?documentID=1148 |publisher=Manchester.gov.uk |accessdate=2008-07-15}}</ref> Partial reconstructions of the forts walls, including the ramparts and gateways were opened in 1984.<ref name="guide"/> In 2001&ndash;2005 the [[University of Manchester|University of Manchester Archaeological Unit]] carried out excavations in the ''vicus'' before the area undergoes further regeneration on construction.<ref name="Gregory1"/> The archaeological investigation of Mamucium Roman fort and its associated civilian settlement has provided about 10,000 artefacts.<ref name="Gregory181"/>

==Layout==
The fort measures {{convert|160|m|yd|0}} by {{convert|130|m|yd}}. It was surrounded by stone ramparts between {{convert|2.1|m|ft|0}} and {{convert|2.7|m|ft|0}} thick,<ref name="Hylton4">Hylton (2003), p.&nbsp;4.</ref> although the stone rampart replace an earlier wooden one around 200. As well as a rampart, the fort was defended by a double ditch.<ref name="Hylton2">Hylton (2003), p.&nbsp;2.</ref> The ''vicus'' associated with Mamucium surrounds the site on the west, north, and east sides, but majority of it lies to the north of the fort. It covers about {{convert|26|ha|acre}} and the fort spans about {{convert|2|ha|acre}}.<ref name="Gregory2"/> Buildings within the ''vicus'' would have generally been one storey, [[timber framing|timber framed]] and of [[wattle and daub]] construction.<ref name="Hylton2"/> There may be a cemetery south east of the fort.<ref name="Hylton4"/>
