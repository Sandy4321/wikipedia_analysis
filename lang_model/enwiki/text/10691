'''Fort Malden''' was a fort that stood on the remains of the second [[Fort Amherstburg]] in [[Amherstburg, Ontario]]. The original fort was abandoned in [[1813]] and no plans were in place to replace it until the [[1820]]s. The fort was finally rebuilt during [[1838]] to [[1840]]. This fort lasted until [[1851]] when the last regular forces occupied the site. It was an important staging area for the several engagements against canadian rebel forces the british engaged in. 

From [[1859]] to [[1870]], Fort Malden was a lunatic asylum. Abandoned once again, the fort was acquired as a park by the Government of Canada in [[1937]].
