==Playing career==
Blizzard started his career with [[Watford F.C.|Watford]] and made his debut for against [[Norwich City F.C.|Norwich City]] on 24 April 2004, scoring a goal on his debut. He made occasional appearances in his first full season for the club, but became a first-team regular when [[Adrian Boothroyd]] replaced [[Ray Lewington]] as manager in March 2005. He started the [[2005<U+2013>06 in English football|2005<U+2013>06]] season in the first-team, but contracted the [[Epstein-Barr virus]] in late September and did not play a first-team game for Watford again. He returned to the bench for a single game, on 14 April 2006, wearing a [[Goalkeeper (association football)|goalkeeper]]'s kit. With second choice goalkeeper [[Alec Chamberlain]] out ill, the semi-fit Blizzard took the substitute goalkeeper spot, having played the position as a child.

Having made just one first-team appearance in [[2006<U+2013>07 in English football|2006<U+2013>07]], Blizzard spent the second half of the season on loan at [[Stockport County F.C.|Stockport County]] and [[Milton Keynes Dons F.C.|Milton Keynes Dons]]. It was announced on 21 May 2007, that he had signed a two year deal with the MK Dons. On 7 August, however, it was announced that Blizzard had left the Dons by mutual consent; two days later, Stockport confirmed Blizzard would be re-joining the club as a free agent. 

Blizzard joined League One Bristol Rovers, despite there being reported interest from Championship clubs, on a free transfer on 9 July 2009 having agreed the deal over a week earlier. He made his debut as a substitute in a 2<U+2013>1 defeat to Leyton Orient on 8 August 2009.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bristolrovers.co.uk/page/LatestNews/0,,10328~1703311,00.html |title=Blizzard signs for Bristol Rovers|accessdate=2009-07-09 |work=Bristol Rovers F.C. official site}}</ref>

During the 2010<U+2013>11 season, Blizzard lost his starting place in the Pirates side, as new signing [[Wayne Brown (midfielder)|Wayne Brown]] came in and took his place, but gained his first start of the season when Brown was ruled out with an ankle problem.<ref>http://www.bristolrovers.co.uk/page/LatestNews/0,,10328~2144519,00.html</ref> In March 2011, he joined former manager [[Jim Gannon]] at [[Port Vale F.C.|Port Vale]], signing on loan until the end of the season.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/p/port_vale/9429219.stm|title=Port Vale sign Bristol Rovers' Dominic Blizzard |date=18 March 2011|work=BBC Sport|accessdate=18 March 2011}}</ref>
