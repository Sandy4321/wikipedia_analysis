'''Trinity Church''', on Queen Anne Square in [[Newport, Rhode Island]], is a historic parish church in the [[Episcopal Diocese of Rhode Island]]. Founded in 1698, it is the oldest [[ECUSA|Episcopal]] parish in the state. The current Georgian building was designed by architect Richard Munday and constructed in 1725<U+2013>26.

==History==
The [[Newport, Rhode Island]] congregation began to gather about 1698. When [[Richard Coote, 1st Earl of Bellomont]] was investigating charges of the [[infraction]]s of the [[Navigation Acts]] in Rhode Island, he requested that the [[Board of Trade]] send a [[minister (Christianity)|minister]] from [[Kingdom of England|England]] to Rhode Island. The first church structure was built in 1700.

The present church building was constructed in 1725-26, designed by local builder [[Richard Munday]], who based his designs on those that he had seen that [[Christopher Wren|Sir Christopher Wren]] had used in [[London, England|London]] churches in the late 17th century. The church's design is very similar to that of [[Old North Church]] in Boston. Trinity, however, was built entirely of [[wood]]. It is believed to be the only church building with its three-tiered wineglass [[pulpit]] remaining in its original position in the center of the aisle, in front of the [[altar]]. The building was enlarged in 1764, but otherwise retains its original character with [[box pew]]s.

In 1731, [[Dean (religion)|Dean]] [[George Berkeley]] donated the first [[Pipe organ|organ]], whose wooden case, decorated with the Crown of England and the [[mitre]]s of the [[archbishop]]s of [[Canterbury]] and [[York]], survives in place. The first [[organist]] was [[Charles Theodore Pachelbel]], son of the famous [[Germany|German]] [[Baroque]] composer [[Johann Pachelbel]].

The church was used as a [[garrison]] church by the [[British Army]] in 1776<U+2013>1778. Local oral tradition reports that [[George Washington]] attended services there in 1781. The [[Chevalier de Ternay]], the [[French people|French]] admiral who died in December 1780, is buried in the [[churchyard]].

Also interred here is [[Sylvester Gardiner|Dr. Sylvester Gardiner]], who in 1753 purchased an immense tract of [[Maine]] [[wilderness]] where he founded what is now the city of [[Gardiner, Maine|Gardiner]].  Many members of the [[Vanderbilt family]] attended the church when summering in Newport.

Historical architect, [[Norman Isham]], restored several parts of the church in the 1920s.  The church has been seen in several films, including ''[[Amistad (1997 film)|Amistad]]'' and ''[[Evening (film)|Evening]]''. The burial service for former Rhode Island Senator [[Claiborne Pell]] was held at the church in January 2009.

The current Rector is Anne Marie Richards, who hails from Olney, MD.
