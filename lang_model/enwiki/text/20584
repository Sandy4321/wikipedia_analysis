'''John Rawls''' ([[February 21]], [[1921]] &ndash; [[November 24]], [[2002]]) was an [[United States|American]] [[philosopher]], a [[professor]] of [[political philosophy]] at [[Harvard University]] and author of ''[[A Theory of Justice]]'' ([[1971]]), ''[[Political Liberalism]]'', ''[[Justice as Fairness: A Restatement]]'', and ''[[The Law of Peoples]]''. He is widely considered one of the most important English-language political philosophers of the 20th century.

==Biographical sketch==
John Borden (Bordley) Rawls was born in [[Baltimore, Maryland]] on February 21, 1921.  He was the second of five sons to William Lee Rawls and Anna Abell Stump.  Rawls attended [[school]] in Baltimore only for a short time before transferring to  [[Kent School]], an [[Episcopal]]ian [[University-preparatory school|preparatory school]] in [[Connecticut]].  Upon graduation in [[1939]], Rawls went on to [[Princeton University]], where he became interested in philosophy, and was elected to join the membership of [[The Ivy Club]].  In [[1943]], he completed his [[Bachelor of Arts]] degree and joined the [[United States Army|Army]].  During this time ([[World War II]]), Rawls served as an [[infantry]]man in the Pacific where he toured [[New Guinea]], the [[Philippines]], and [[Japan]] and witnessed the aftermath of the bombing of [[Hiroshima]]. After this experience, Rawls turned down the offer of becoming an officer and left the army as a private in [[1946]].  Shortly thereafter, he returned to Princeton to pursue a doctorate in moral philosophy.  Rawls then married Margaret Fox, a [[Brown University|Brown]] graduate, in [[1949]].  Margaret and John had a shared interest in indexing - they spent their first holiday together writing the index for a book on [[Friedrich Nietzsche|Nietzsche]], and Rawls wrote the index for ''[[A Theory of Justice]]'' himself. After earning his [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] from Princeton in [[1950]], Rawls decided to teach there until [[1952]], when he received a [[Fulbright Fellowship]] to [[University of Oxford|Oxford University]] ([[Christ Church, Oxford|Christ Church]]), where he was influenced by the liberal political theorist and historian of ideas [[Isaiah Berlin]] and, more strongly, the legal theorist [[H.L.A. Hart]]. Next, he returned to the United States, serving first as an assistant and then associate professor at [[Cornell University]]. In [[1962]], he became a full professor of philosophy at Cornell, and soon achieved a tenured position at [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]]. In 1964 he moved to [[Harvard University]], where he taught for almost forty years. Rawls suffered the first of several [[stroke]]s in [[1995]], which severely impeded his ability to continue working. Nonetheless, he was still able to complete a work entitled ''[[The Law of Peoples]],'' which contains the most complete statement of his views on international justice,  before dying in November 2002.

==Rawls's contribution to political and moral philosophy==
Rawls is noted for his contributions to [[liberal]] [[political philosophy]]. Among the ideas from Rawls's work that have received wide attention are:
*[[Justice as Fairness]] which consists of the liberty principle and the difference principle.
*The [[original position]].
*[[Reflective equilibrium]].
*[[Overlapping consensus]].
*[[Public reason]].
Many academic philosophers believe that Rawls made an important and lasting contribution to political philosophy. There is general agreement that the publication of ''[[A Theory of Justice]]'' in 1971 led to a revival in the academic study of political philosophy. Rawls's work has crossed disciplinary lines, receiving serious attention from [[economics|economists]], [[law|legal scholars]], [[political science|political scientists]], [[sociology|sociologists]], and [[theology|theologians]]. Rawls has the unique distinction among contemporary political philosophers of being frequently cited by the courts of law in the United States and referred to by practicing politicians in the United Kingdom.

==''A Theory of Justice''==
{{main|A Theory of Justice}}

In ''A Theory of Justice'', Rawls attempts to solve the intractable problem of [[distributive justice]] by utilizing a version of the familiar device of the [[social contract]]. The resultant theory is known as "Justice as Fairness", from which Rawls derives two principles of justice: ''the liberty principle'' and ''the difference principle''.

==Political Liberalism''==
{{main|Political Liberalism}} 

Rawls's later work focused on the question of stability: could a society ordered by the two principles of justice endure? His answer to this question is contained in a collection of lectures titled ''Political Liberalism''. In ''Political Liberalism'', Rawls introduced the idea of an ''[[overlapping consensus]]''&mdash;or agreement on ''justice as fairness'' between citizens who hold different religious and philosophical views (or ''conceptions of the good''). ''Political Liberalism'' also introduced the idea of ''[[public reason]]''&mdash;the common reason of all citizens.

In ''Political Liberalism'' Rawls addressed the most common criticism levelled at ''Theory''&mdash;the criticism that the principles of justice were simply an alternative systematic conception of justice that was superior to [[utilitarianism]] or any other comprehensive theory. This meant that justice as fairness turned out to be simply another reasonable comprehensive doctrine that was incompatible with other reasonable doctrines. It failed to distinguish between a comprehensive moral theory which addressed the problem of justice and that of a political conception of justice that was independent of any comprehensive theory. 

The political conception of justice that Rawls introduces in ''Political Liberalism'' is the view of justice that people with conflicting, but reasonable views, would agree on to regulate the basic structure of society (note the new limits on the scope of justice as fairness). As such the political conception of justice would be the overlapping consensus about justice. 

Rawls also modified the principles of justice to become the following (with the first having priority over the second):

#Each person has an equal claim to a fully adequate scheme of basic rights and liberties, which scheme is compatible with the same scheme for all; and in this scheme the equal political liberties, and only those liberties, are to be guaranteed their fair value.
#Social and economic inequalities are to satisfy two conditions: first they are to be attached to positions and offices open to all under conditions of fair equality of opportunity; and second they are to be to the greatest benefit of the least advantaged members of society. 

These principles are subtly modified from the principles in ''Theory''. The first principle now reads 'equal claim' instead of 'equal right', and he also replaces the phrase 'system of basic liberties' with 'a fully adequate scheme of equal basic rights and liberties.'

==The Law of Peoples==
:''Main article: [[The Law of Peoples]]''
Although there were passing comments on international affairs in ''A Theory of Justice'', it wasn't until late in his career that Rawls formulated a comprehensive theory of international politics with the publication of ''The Law of Peoples.''  This work shocked many of his liberal allies.  He claimed that "well-ordered" peoples could be either "liberal" or "decent hierarchical."  The tolerance of the latter by the former was needed to ensure that a liberal foreign policy was not "unreasonable" to the rest of the world.  Decent hierarchies could have state religions and deny adherents of [[minority]] [[faith]]s to hold positions of power within the nation.  They could organise participation via corporatism rather than via elections.  However, they were not allowed to violate human rights, or else would be amongst the other categories of "outlaw states," "societies burdened by unfavourable conditions" and "benevolent absolutisms."  

Charles Beitz had previously written a study that applied Rawls's second principle of justice to international relations.  He believed that redistribution could be justified by the inequality of natural resources amongst countries.  Rawls, to the amazement of many, refuted this application and claimed that nations were self-sufficient, unlike the cooperative enterprises that domestic societies are.  Although Rawls recognised that aid should be given to governments who must suspend human rights in times of great trouble, he claimed that there must be a cut-off point for such aid.  Continuing to give aid indefinitely would see nations with industrious populations subsidise those with idle populations and would create a [[moral hazard]] problem where governments could spend irresponsibly in the knowledge that they will be bailed out by those nations who had spent responsibly.  These arguments seemed to parallel those offered by [[Nozick]] against domestic welfare and were widely considered to be inconsistent with Rawls's domestic theory.  Rawls claimed that natural resources do not determine a country's wealth, but that it is determined by human capital and the political culture of a country.  His theory seems not to account for nations like [[Botswana]] whose affluence has been gained mostly through natural resources or of the tendency of human capital to migrate towards nations that are already affluent and cause a [[brain drain]]. On the other hand, the success of Botswana, compared to a failed state with similar resources, such as Angola, might be seen as supporting his  theory, although one could also cite many other causes for these outcomes as well.

More predictable comments included a condemnation of bombing civilians and of the American firebombing of Japanese cities in [[World War II]].  A near-mythical picture of a "Statesman" is detailed, who looks to the next generation, promotes international harmony and rises above the jingoism of the electorate.  Every country had to respect human rights, or face the prospect of intervention by the international community.  This may seem reminiscent of [[neo-conservativism]], but Rawls was optimistic in believing that non-liberal nations would eventually see the benefits of liberalism for themselves and come to respect human rights.
