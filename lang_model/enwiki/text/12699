'''Da'Rel Scott''' (born May 26, 1988) is an American [[college football]] player. He is currently the [[starting lineup|starting]] [[running back]] for the [[Maryland Terrapins football|Maryland Terrapins]] at the [[University of Maryland, College Park|University of Maryland]]. During the [[2008 Atlantic Coast Conference football season|2008 season]], he was the second-leading rusher in the [[Atlantic Coast Conference]], behind [[Jonathan Dwyer]] of [[Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets football|Georgia Tech]].

Scott played [[high school football|interscholastic football]] as a [[running back]] and [[free safety]] at [[Plymouth-Whitemarsh High School]]. He was moderately recruited, but [[Scout.com]] thought he was more suited to the position of [[wide receiver]] or [[cornerback]] at the [[college football|intercollegiate level]]. In [[2006 Maryland Terrapins football team|2006]], he enrolled at the [[University of Maryland, College Park|University of Maryland]], where he was moved to wide receiver, but he spent the entire season on [[redshirt (college sports)|redshirt]] status. [[2007 Maryland Terrapins football team|The following season]], he saw limited action as a reserve running back behind starters [[Lance Ball]] and [[Keon Lattimore]]. He also played on [[special teams]] as a [[kickoff returner]], which was the coaching staff's attempt to get him on the field in some capacity because of his speed.

In [[2008 Maryland Terrapins football team|2008]], Scott took over as Maryland's starting running back, and spent much of the season as the leading [[rush (American football)|rusher]] in the [[Atlantic Coast Conference]] (ACC). He was eventually surpassed by [[Jonathan Dwyer]] of Georgia Tech, although he and Scott both were named to the All-ACC first team at the season's end. Scott also became the [[2008 Humanitarian Bowl]] most valuable player when he broke the University of Maryland bowl game rushing record, and he finished the season with 1,133&nbsp;rushing yards, the seventh Terrapin player to surpass a thousand yards in a single season.

==Early life==
Scott was born on May 26, 1988 in {{city-state|Conshohocken|Pennsylvania}} to Gloria and Lee Scott, Sr. He has two older brothers, Lee Scott, Jr., who played football as a [[defensive back]] at [[La Salle Explorers football|La&nbsp;Salle]], and James, who ran track at [[Saint Joseph's Hawks|Saint Joseph's]].<ref name=bio/> When Da'Rel Scott was eight years old, his parents had a falling out, which prompted his father to leave the family. Thereafter, Lee Scott, Sr. was no longer involved in raising his sons and would often miss scheduled visits.<ref name=cold/> Da'Rel Scott said, "He just kept letting me down. Just day by day, I was thinking, 'I need a father figure in my life.'" In high school, his attitude changed, and he said, "I don't need him."<ref name=cold/> Despite the absence of his biological father, Scott grew up with the support of his mother, two brothers, cousin, youth football coach, and high school athletic director.<ref name=cold/>

He attended [[Plymouth-Whitemarsh High School]] in [[Plymouth Meeting, Pennsylvania]], where he was a four-year [[letterman|letterwinner]] in [[high school football|football]], [[track and field|track]], and [[high school basketball|basketball]]. In track during his junior year, he won the state championship in the [[100-meter dash]] with a time of 10.56 seconds. In football, Scott was a three-year [[starting lineup|starter]] and played as both a [[tailback]] and [[free safety]]. During his senior year, he rushed for 2,523 yards and 38 touchdowns on 232 attempts. As both a junior and senior, he received the Maxwell Award for the conference player of the year. As a senior, ''[[The Times Herald (Philadelphia)|The Times Herald]]'' named him the area player of the year, the [[Associated Press]] named him an all-state player, and he was invited to the [[Big 33 Football Classic]] all-star game. SuperPrep named him an all-region player.<ref name="bio">[http://umterps.cstv.com/sports/m-footbl/mtt/scott_darel00.html Player Bio: Da'Rel Scott], University of Maryland, retrieved November 16, 2008.</ref> [[Rivals.com]] rated him a four-star prospect and assessed him as the 21st-ranked "athlete" recruit in the nation.<ref name=rivals/> Scout.com assessed him as a three-star prospect, and wrote of him, "This kid can flat out fly.

==College career==

Scott's [[special teams]] performance in that game sufficiently impressed head coach Friedgen that he said, "I think I've got to try to get him involved within the offense.

I said 'Did you put Da'Rel in for that screen pass?' He said, 'Lance's equipment was broken, so he had to go in the game.'"<ref name=speedster/></blockquote>
In the loss to [[2007 Florida State Seminoles football team|Florida State]], Scott [[rush (American football)|rush]]ed twice for 17&nbsp;yards and returned four kickoffs for 132&nbsp;yards.

===2008 season===
After the graduation of running backs Ball and Lattimore, Scott competed with [[Morgan Green]] for the [[starting lineup|starting]] position. At the conclusion of spring practice, it appeared they would share the duties as they had complementary running styles: Scott had breakaway speed, while Green was a hard runner for short-yardage gains.<ref name=punch>Heather Dinich, [http://sports.espn.go.com/ncf/news/story?id=3373444 Green, Scott hope to form 1-2 punch for Maryland], ESPN, May 1, 2008.</ref> However, Green suffered a [[quadriceps]] injury that caused him to fall to the third-string position behind true freshman [[Davin Meggett]].<ref name=green>Patrick Stevens, [http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2009/apr/22/greens-time-may-finally-arrive/ Green's time may finally arrive], ''The Washington Times'', April 22, 2009.</ref>

==Personal life==
Scott motivates himself for games by channeling the anger at his father's abandonment. He said, "I am always going to have anger because of how he did me. It is always going to be there. It is not going away. No way at all."<ref name=cold>Eric Prisbell, [http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/09/26/AR2008092603386.html Not Left Out in the Cold; Terps' Scott Uses Father's Desertion as Motivation to Succeed], ''The Washington Post'', September 26, 2008.</ref> While basketball player [[Michael Jordan]] was Scott's childhood sports idol, he says Jordan was not the inspiration for his [[jersey number]] of 23. Scott chose it as a combination of his older brothers' high school numbers: James wore number 20, and Lee, Jr. wore number 3. Scott said, "They were my father."<ref name=cold/>
